Ove my style 
 These hoes don't love me, they love my benz, love my rims, love my style, 
 These fiends don't love me, they love my coke, love my dope, love my ink, 
 These haters don't love me, it don't matter to me, I stay hater free 'cause imma down ass g, 
 'Cause if I don't make dollars, then it don't make cents, if it don't make dollars, it don't make cents. 
 1st verse 
 I'm in town dog, 
 Mexican brown dog, 
 I'm signed to interscope, 
 I'm grims a c-note, 
 500 cokily add to a kilo, 
 Id rather be rich, than snitch nigga out cold, 
 My crack in sinthostat, 
 Drummers with hunny hats, 
 My bitch from d.r, 
 Switch 'em with bigger stash, 
 Movin my work, jus for some boots n a skirt, 
 I was loose but she complainin it hurt, 
 Ice skatin on ice, 
 I got these crack heads, scrapin the mic, 
 Late at night, bitch be shakin her dice, 
 Runnin' from feds, like I had jerry rice legs, 
 'Cause the dope and the rice come from pac and them plant eggs, 
 It's the top shotter that rocked prada, that rhymed proper, 
 In high school I had ex in my gym locker, locker, locker, locker. 
 2nd verse 
 I'm a sneaker addict, 
 Drug fanatic, 
 I live lavish, 
 Got more carots, 
 That bunny rabbits, 
 I plant 'marry I', 
 Courtyard groupie's lurkin, 
 An them niggas wit no pussy is always jerkin, 
 An niggas handcuff hoes like female cops, 
 I got ma wrists all froze, so the COs drop, 
 Ayo 'em drink malibu, dre drink henny, banks drink baileys and buck drink remi, 
 I'm on the 7 a glock like, I'm still smellin musty, leavin' barcelona for some argentina pussy, 
 Ye man g-unit stunts it ain't nothin', million dollar deals 'cause our fans dare hustle, 
 I stay stuntin, my glock stay pumpin, 58-58, I got my cell phone jumpin', 
 T-o-n-y the talk of new york, blowin' dro in the 6, on the way to court. 
 3rd verse 
 You in the CBA, I'm in the NBA, it's the rap t-mac, I stay with a gat, 
 Click clack, I sit back 'n' watch my soldiers attack, ya rhymes a snitches, homie I'm dealin' with fact, 
 Keep my car out the sun so the paint wont fade, n if my jewels don't shine its time to upgrade, 
 Imma ball till I fall, niggas can't ruin me, from platinum plaques, wall to wall jewellery, I love my style, 
 Hoes scream my name, its tony yayo, a cats scowl in the game, see niggas wanna kill me like sindy in scream, but I pack the mac-nilly wit a inferred beam, ayo I'm on daily like freddy in the dream, n my chains so heavy, it spotted to my splean, u front on my team, ma niggas will finish you, automatic traypound will fuckin' diminish you
