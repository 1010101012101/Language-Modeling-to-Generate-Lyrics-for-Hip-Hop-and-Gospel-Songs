Tony Yayo Chorus 
 I don't love hoes 
 I ain't sharing em, I ain't lovin' em 
 Or hand cuffin em, 'cause baby I'm pimpin' you love hoes you be chasin em, You be lacin em 
 While I'm replacin em 
 'Cause baby I'm pimpin' 
 Tony Yayo Verse 1 
 I lay my pimp game down when it comes to these bitches 
 They do what I say and obey all my wishes 
 Wash all my clothes and clean dirty dishes 
 I turn a sweet bitch to a switchblade system 
 While you shop on melrose buy hoes shoes 
 I'm in micky Ds buyin number twos 
 Now get ya ass on the track and get the dough for me 
 I'm the number 1 pimp so she chose me and my hoes where them ballers and rollers be 
 They collect them G's and they give 'em to me 
 I'm pimpin' no perms just gators 
 Pimpin' I'll show ya how to stunt on them haters 
 Pimpin' forced them new cadilac 
 Pimpin' chinchill with them fur hats 
 Pimpin' I'll show ya how to school a hoe 
 When you chasin them bitches I'm chasin the dough 
 Yeah

 Tony Yayo Verse 2 
 You ain't freakin I ain't speakin' 
 Girl I ain't your hubby 
 Mom back that thing up girl time is money 
 If you ain't freakin I ain't speakin' 
 Girl I ain't no dummy 
 Or we can play marry or pop some burry 
 I said how 50 grand be gettin' on 
 I ain't speakin' girl I ain't speakin' 
 Girl I ain't speakin' 
 I said if Banks can't be gettin' on 
 I ain't speakin' girl I ain't speakin' 
 Girl I ain't speakin' 
 I straight outta cashville I better with Bucks in his masion in Nashville 
 My chick from the D used to live on Marshalls block 
 Put a foot to her like Marshall lugs 
 I gotta stay with a hoe in a CPT 
 Ask Snoop in a D.R.E. 
 Girl fix ya lipstick ya hairs a mess 
 And I know your feet hurt in them damn payless
