What the fuck is the deal it's the talk of New York Tony Yayo (G-G-G Unit) 
 Yeah, Yo word up man, its fucking cold out here man, my fucking toes is killin' me man (its fucking brick) I fucking been on the block all day man but you know I mean I gotta get this money run sleek snow... 
 Yo we project living 
 With plastic on the furniture, 
 Little niggaz coming up will 
 Fucking try to murda ya 
 The D's not out so the coast is clear 
 But it's getting hard to sleep with this roach in my ear 
 Everybody got a nena everybody got a vest 
 New York City is the arena of death 
 Yo the strip moving slow but everybody going hard 
 Seeing more d's than a damn report card 
 Everybody rap now 
 Follow they dreams I'm a call my clientele man and 
 Sign all my fiends same gear for a week wearing dirty clothes 
 All day in the spot by a dirty stove trials keep me strong 
 Hope keep me happy, but I'm only human so these niggaz wanna clap me 
 The drug game over but there's money to make so niggaz clappin at niggaz 
 To raise the crime rate 
 You can live by the gun or die by the bullet 
 Niggaz push me for sho I'm gonna pull it 
 Material objects got the world crooked 
 In my hood they hustle and be on the juoke shit 
 Snakes in the grass be on that bullshit 
 Niggas that's ass stay with the full clip 
 Guns get blast niggaz on that shook shit 
 So live by the gun or die by the bullet 
 Tthe rhymes you spit can embarrass the city 
 Well my game bag names like paris and nikki 
 Load the semi I'm in the spot carving the crack 
 You stunt ill leave my bullets lodged in ur back 
 New York City everything move fast little girls get 
 Pregnant throw they baby in the trash 
 China white wizzy movin quickly on the ave same coke 
 That got whitney in the re-hab 
 Up early in the morning 'cause there's money to earn 'cause the early bird 
 Be the one that catch the worm we nicks trieze twenties and dimes got my spot looking like a soul train line 
 Fuck doin' time, I'm trying to progress, get that money man nigga serve ur projects 
 Hustlin homie that's all I know in the summer time I can make the whole strip snow 
 You can live by the gun or die by the bullet 
 Niggaz push me for sho I'm gonna pull it 
 Material objects got the world crooked 
 In my hood they hustle and be on the juoke shit 
 Snakes in the grass be on that bullshit 
 Niggas that's ass stay with the full clip 
 Guns get blast niggaz on that shook shit 
 So live by the gun or die by the bullet
