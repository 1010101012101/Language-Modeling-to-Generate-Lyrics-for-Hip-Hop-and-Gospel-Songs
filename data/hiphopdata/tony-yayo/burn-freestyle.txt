(Feat. 50 Cent) 
 [50 Cent:] GGGGGGG G Unit 
 (Verse 1: Tony Yayo) 
 In New York you get stalked like a snake's prey 
 Yo the streets is a battle field you die any day 
 Some cry on they knees when they pray 
 All you hear is he said she said around the way 
 I'm in the no fly zone private hide away 
 Tryin' to prolly with my sons like its Father's Day 
 When my revolver spray 
 You better andalay 
 I take ya moms away 
 Writin' rhymes till my arms decay 
 On mics I'm dynamite like Jay Jay 
 Listen hombre 
 I glisten in broad day 
 The feds got me framed in a picture 
 'Cause I got my chick trained to hit ya 
 Like Amy Fisher 
 Let a slugs fly at a bug eyed judicier 
 Play Fat Cat and I'll strip you for your whiskers 
 We move Fishscale you messin' with Fish Yay 
 Make cars fish tail when we shoot at them brakes 
 We pop Mo's and puff ounces 
 In the club we pay off them bouncers 
 To lay off the Tray Pounders 
 When the cops raid the crib they want the houses 
 Fed times head lines read about us 
 Follow my fathers footsteps why bother? 
 Charter a few leer jets we got the Ganja 
 Never had a seed but I please your baby mama 
 Lick her on her knees but she's on Gabbanna 
 Put her on a track too ten niggas want her 
 Flaunt her 
 Get my cheese back on the corner 
 Nigga get a glance, hit the free lance performer 
 Heaven and hell will prevail when I'm a goner 
 50 Cent: 
 One time 
 That's Tony Yayo 
 Lloyd Banks come on come on 
 Tony Yayo: 
 50 you can retire whenever you ready 
 (Verse 2: Lloyd Banks) 
 I'm in the mountains with the trees are palm 
 In a New York State Of Mind tryin' to freeze my arm up 
 Got the Balm 
 Blowin' on sticky with a slut 
 It went from "Hi how you doin'?" to a quicky in the truck 
 I'm tryin' to find where the party is at 
 I'm bringin' me, Jesse, Ferrari and Black 
 My hood is all fucked up it ain't no goals 
 The little boys turn to convicts and girls turn to hos 
 I'm ridin' through the Valley where you might hear turns like "Ese homes" 
 Mama ain't raised no fool I'm talented and gifted 
 I practice in boats so I could balance it 
 I'm fresh out the dirt nigga you washed up 
 Thirty something and never seen a fan star struck 
 50 Cent: 
 Yeah ya lame 
 Ya wanksta
