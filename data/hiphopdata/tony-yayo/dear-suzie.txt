 I went from manhattan coombs, to allen and downstate 
 To austin county, and did shock upstate 
 But anyway ma' I'll be home in January 
 Till then, keep it tight like the holy virgin mary 
 I had a rumble in my house and sneak thief got cut 
 From his ear to his chin got his ass striped up 
 I got the phone on lock from 9 to 10 
 1 just got off the jet with "50" and "EM" 
 Listen miss, exit no, you love my flo 
 Baby I'm waiting on your mail, here come the "CO" 
 Ma' its Tony Yayo, girl I'm bound to blow 
 I can't wait to come home and preform a show 
 Get some ice from jacob so my neck can glow 
 Twist some haze, twist some hash and a pound of dro 
 Buy some dice, roll chips matter fact C-Lo's
