 Yayo: 
 Ma, I'm curious to know if I lick that spot 
 Will it make your body shiver and your panties drop 
 Your baby father's a lame, he a dead-beat dad 
 So you and your kids can come cruise in my jag 
 You my boo like usher and alicia keys (Joe: My Booo) 
 And every time that you touch me girl you please my needs 
 We like George and Weezy, Jada and Will 
 Let's shop till we drop out in Beverly Hills 
 (Bridge:Tony Yayo) 
 I'm curious to know if you want me girl 
 If so ma, let's fly to country girl

 You want them furs and them minks and them diamond pearls 
 Joe:

 Yayo: 
 I saw her in the projects, going to the store 
 I never had a crush like this before 
 Her baby daddy is a killa, he hold weight in adika 
 But every time he home, he beaten her and smackin' her 
 Ma you don't need your face black and blue 
 You need diamonds from Jacob that's black and blue 
 Water front property, you see the sun rising 
 Back to the subject, let me stop fantasising 
 Listen boo, nobody in the world is perfect 
 So when you around my team there's no need to be nervous 
 I hit it from the back, pull out your tracks 
 It's curiousity girl, choose the cat 
 Joe:

 Baby I'm curious, said I'm curious
