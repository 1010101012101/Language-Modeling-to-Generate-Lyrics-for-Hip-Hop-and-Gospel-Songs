My Bullets whistle like 
 And Fly right pass ya dome 
 My Bullets whistle like 
 A Hundred shots a nigga gone 
 My Bullets whistle like 
 I got that Typewriter tommy gun just like Capone 
 My Bullets like 
 6 feet deep another homie gone 
 We Juggle woman and we smuggle them bricks 
 New 750 model hug on my dick 
 I send a hater hater a postcard from paradise 
 The beach sandy that money got the setting right 
 No money less stress 
 Now all my enemies are in my book of death 
 I'm in that Luis Bomber 
 Yeah my car is like the stealth bomber 
 I see popo I mash when I hit the corner 
 Money at the bar raise the global economy 
 Global phone leer jet recession don't bother me 
 Herme's slippers fat ass cell 
 Two sisters I'm so ambitious like pharell 
 Repeat Hook: 
 I'm far from a legend I'll never be one 
 Street hall of fame die with a big gun 
 Like E-money my Troy at the sports bar 
 I get money and blow it on a sha'pa 
 Interscope wanna divide and conquer 
 Momma always told me don't trust em 
 R.I.P to Derry ... Albert 
 To get an education need a 40 cal 'cause 
 Lock your doors and hide your children 
 Shortie 13 years old and he dead on linen 
 Same day different shit 
 Repeat Hook: 
 My Bullets whistle like 
 And Fly right pass ya dome
