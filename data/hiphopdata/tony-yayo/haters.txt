BIG UP! To all my haters-- all my haters--all my haters! 
 Tony Yayo: 
 (Unh, yeah) Fuck state greens--I'm tryna (tryin' to) kick bitch 
 Quarter key, I ball a key--Blake Grif. 
 Jet ski, black sand, bad bitch--my passport need pages for the next trip 
 Fall asleep, we got the cars that your ass dream of 
 Kush, loud pack, let your bitch blow some steam off. 
 I keep the Ruger under the Rugby 
 These h*es hear the rumors and they love me, love me 
 Fast cars, loose women, the high life 
 We bust bottles, smoke weed all night 
 Ern Mast (???) cost as much as the 'Gators so... 
 (Roscoe Dash) BIG UP! To all my haters! 
 50 Cent: Chorus 2x 
 All we do is cuttin' with the paper, p-paper, 
 Big ballin' (?) make a hater wanna hate us, h-hate us 
 Can't take it when they see the money makers, 
 We make a 
 Whole lot of money, who, who, whole lot of money. 
 Shawty Lo: 
 Shawty Lo--I hear you hate us 
 All the small talk--a little later 
 Yeah, they know, me and Yayo 
 In the NY, plenty Yayos (?) 
 Bitch betta have my money 
 Water came in, now I'm faded (?) as a diamond 
 Got them bitches (?) as New Jack (?) City 
 Count' on my knee (?), money and I ain't magic city 
 Bitch I'm Shawty, born home Charlotte (?) 
 West Side's on one, bank head Shawty 
 Bitch I'm wit' it, brought home ticket (?) 
 And I got the whole, chi chi chi chi chi, you ain't wit me, wit me! 
 50 Cent: Chorus 2x 
 All we do is cuttin' with the paper, p-paper, 
 Big ballin' (?) make a hater wanna hate us, h-hate us 
 Can't take it when they see the money makers, 
 We make a 
 Whole lot of money, who, who, whole lot of money. 
 Roscoe Dash: 
 Attracted to the money like bees on honey 
 My swag on dummy-- cash on runny 
 (And) I'm way more than what you asked for, honey 
 Pockets on collection plate from the last four Sundys (Sundays) 
 I'm ill, hold the pills, my skills, so forreal 
 Watch this candy rain fall, I'm on the real, 'No Hands' forreal 
 I'm on a whole 'nother plateau 
 'Lean Back,' Fat Joe 
 I ain't got time to be concerned with you, a**hole 
 Status all wavy (?), I'm on to y'all hatin' 
 I'm so far ahead--I'm sittin' down waitin' 
 I feel your frustration for my very last statement 
 UMM, BIG UP! To all my haters! 
 50 Cent: Chorus 2x 
 All we do is cuttin' with the paper, p-paper, 
 Big ballin' (?) make a hater wanna hate us, h-hate us 
 Can't take it when they see the money makers, 
 We make a 
 Whole lot of money, who, who, whole lot of money.
