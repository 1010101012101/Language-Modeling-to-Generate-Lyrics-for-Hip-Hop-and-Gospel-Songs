22's on the Porsche drugs henny in the fridge 
 Dats how we live it is wut it is 
 We run up in your crib snatchin kids in your wiz 
 We know where you live it is wut it is 
 If we can't eat then your team can't live 
 That's how it is it is wut it is 
 Nigga that's how it is it is wut it is 
 Nigga that's how it is it is wut it is 
 (Verse 1 yayo) 
 I'm crippin everyday token meet Jamaica 
 My pistol get it poppin' like the pistons and the pacers 
 I'm the messenger of misery I move discrete 
 You kiddin me my victory is in the jaws of defeat 
 Then these haters wana kill me 'cause my dreams is reality 
 The sig with the beam will cause a fatality 
 Just caught a case but it's a minor technicality 
 With shooters on the street prosecuters keep houndin me 
 Wut you know about grammy speeches sandy beaches 
 Pales that seedless four pounds and sweepers 
 Movie features groupie divas deals wit sneakers 
 Secluded in the woods from the snakes and leaches 
 I'm makin' money on the road homie autographin ass 
 While you on a silver horse with your metro pass 
 For every dollar you make nigga I make a G 
 Damn it feels good to live life like me 
 22's on the Porsche drugs henny in the fridge 
 Dats how we live it is wut it is 
 We run up in your crib snatchin kids in your wiz 
 We know where you live it is wut it is 
 If we can't eat then your team can't live 
 That's how it is it is wut it is 
 Nigga that's how it is it is wut it is 
 Nigga that's how it is it is wut it is 
 (Verse 2 Spider Loc) 
 Its spider and big yay, we doin' it which way? 
 Real big 'cause he stay where the rich stay 
 We get it crackin' like a high school ditch day 
 Ghetto mackin is how I do the ITCH BAY 
 A escalade and a two che six tray 
 But his life is the price that the snitch pay 
 But its polital my paper sprowtin 
 My girl get upset I don't take her out n 
 My choice of occupation make her doubting 
 I'll be out the front door I can't take the poutin 
 I'm about anything that'll make a mountin of this moolah 
 Ooh all the cake I'm countin' 
 See the games too deep I can't shake I'm scoutin the clout 
 A fast line like the lakers shoutin 
 Tryna have me a flat wit some acres 
 Out in the boon docks so I move without them fakers 
 22's on the Porsche drugs henny in the fridge 
 Dats how we live it is wut it is

 Nigga that's how it is it is wut it is 
 (Verse 3 yayo) 
 I'm filthy so stop hatin' the milli's wut I'm waving 
 You guilty by association you payin' for operations 
 Your kids be orphans coughin up orcids 
 We sprayin up your benz you layin in coffins 
 Its gunit click nigga you love wut we spit nigga 
 My wrist glist and glitter 'cause we sittin' on six figgas 
 Yo it's all about the benjamins feel the adrenalin 
 Yo we killin' 'em wit beats from dre and eminem 
 Your bitch keep runnin' me I know she feelin' me 
 My last cap and gown was in elementary 
 The kid is back the kid is crack 
 I'm hot hot the way we rap we blazin' tracks 
 You not not and 'em on the beat I had to hire marshall 
 So we keep the club packed full of fire marshals 
 Nigga 'em on the beat I had to hire marshall 
 So we keep the club packed full of fire marshals
