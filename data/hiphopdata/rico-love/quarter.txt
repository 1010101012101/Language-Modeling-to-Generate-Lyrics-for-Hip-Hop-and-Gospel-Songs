Ho, ho, ho 
 Turn the lights on! 
 Ho, ho, ho 
 Turns the lights on! 
 He took her out on a date 
 So I guess he's moving on 
 They went to our favourite place 
 She danced to my favourite song 
 But when he looks in her eyes 
 I know that he misses me 
 I got them trapped with my mime? 
 And I'll never let them near? 
 Trapped up in the wrap sure you and I know I got them quarter 
 Took it simply you but I know he misses my wallet 
 Shawty is a ten but what he needs is a quarter and 
 I'm a quarter so yes I got them caught up baby 
 He belongs, he belongs, shawty your boyfriend belongs to me 
 He belongs, he belongs, he, he belongs to me 
 Shawty is a ten but what he needs is a quarter and 
 I'm a quarter so yes I got them caught up baby 
 When he stares off into space 
 You're wondering what he thinks 
 He's picturing my face 
 Blowing him kisses and winks 
 So it comes this no surprise 
 That you're no longer with her 
 But if I look in his eyes 
 You'll be so out of there 
 Trapped up in the wrap sure you and I know I got them quarter 
 Took it simply you but I know he misses my wallet 
 Shawty is a ten but what he needs is a quarter and 
 I'm a quarter so yes I got them caught up baby 
 He belongs, he belongs, shawty your boyfriend belongs to me 
 He belongs, he belongs, he, he belongs to me 
 Shawty is a ten but what he needs is a quarter and 
 I'm a quarter so yes I got them caught up baby 
 Mirror, mirror on the wall 
 Who's the hottest of them all 
 Yes you've got a lot of pros? 
 He won't need them If I call 
 So you got them diamond rings 
 Gucci purses, Prada bags 
 He bought u a lot of things 
 But I'm the best he's ever had 
 Baby I ain't even? 
 Tripping 'cause he leaving 
 You out of zone as I call him up 
 And give him a reason 
 Shawty is a ten but what he needs is a quarter and 
 I'm a quarter so yes I got them caught up baby 
 Trapped up in the wrap sure you and I know I got them quarter 
 Took it simply you but I know he misses my wallet 
 Shawty is a ten but what he needs is a quarter and 
 I'm a quarter so yes I got them caught up baby 
 He belongs, he belongs, shawty your boyfriend belongs to me 
 He belongs, he belongs, he, he belongs to me 
 Shawty is a ten but what he needs is a quarter and 
 I'm a quarter so yes I got them caught up baby 
 Shawty your boyfriend belongs to me
