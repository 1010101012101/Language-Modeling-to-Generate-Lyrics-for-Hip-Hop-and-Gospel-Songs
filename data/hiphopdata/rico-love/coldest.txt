My shawty is the Coldest! 
 Don't gotta beg for, 
 Don't got to ask twice 
 Don't gotta worry 'bout nothing 
 Girl you can pack lights 
 No, I ain't got to tell 'em that you buy your own bags & shoes 
 You're supposed to! 
 But it got to feel good knowing that a real nigga's right there 
 To hold you down! 
 I ain't scared to say that I got you now 
 I swear, SHE THE Coldest! 
 Even when you're out of town, 
 Will you touch down, will you touch down 
 You been,

 Where she run these streets 
 Silent on her feet 
 When you see her, my nigga

 Just know that's me 
 Can't nobody 'round here say that they hit her 
 No, I ain't gotta tell them that you buy your own bags & shoes,

 But it gotta feel good knowing that a real nigga's right there 
 To hold you down!

 Everything I did for her is 'cause I wanted to
