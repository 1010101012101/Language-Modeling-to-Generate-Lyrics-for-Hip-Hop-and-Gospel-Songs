Too fast slow down, baby you're moving too fast 
 Too fast slow down, baby you're moving too fast 
 Too fast slow down, baby you're moving too fast 
 Too fast slow down, baby you're moving too fast 
 Too fast slow down, baby you're moving too fast 
 You got a body from a magazine, 
 Unapproachable, no one knows she's only 17 
 Could you see her walk in those ... 
 I said baby you're way too young 
 For these older men, she said no I'll just happen fine 
 She thinks she knows what she wants, but I told her 
 You're moving too fast, baby you're moving too fast, slow down 
 You're moving too fast, baby you're moving too fast, slow down 
 Baby slow down, baby slow down, slow down, slow down 
 Baby slow down, baby slow down, slow down, slow down 
 You're moving too fast, baby you're moving too fast, slow down 
 You're moving too fast, baby you're moving too fast, slow down 
 Baby slow down, baby slow down, slow down, slow down 
 Baby slow down, baby slow down, slow down, slow down 
 All the celebrities know her name 
 She's international and she's flying high on cocaine 
 That's superman in her ... 
 Now she's drowning in all her drugs 
 Like a maybe she's only crying out for some love 
 Oh, throw that paper ... 
 And I told her 
 You're moving too fast, baby you're moving too fast, slow down 
 You're moving too fast, baby you're moving too fast, slow down 
 Baby slow down, baby slow down, slow down, slow down 
 Baby slow down, baby slow down, slow down, slow down 
 You're moving too fast, baby you're moving too fast, slow down 
 You're moving too fast, baby you're moving too fast, slow down 
 Baby slow down, baby slow down, slow down, slow down 
 Baby slow down, baby slow down, slow down, slow down 
 Hey pretty girl, it's a big whole open girl 
 But you ain't never seen it, you can be just what you wanna be 
 Take it from me 
 You're moving too fast, baby you're moving too fast, slow down 
 You're moving too fast, baby you're moving too fast, slow down 
 Baby slow down, baby slow down, slow down, slow down 
 Baby slow down, baby slow down, slow down, slow down 
 You're moving too fast, baby you're moving too fast, slow down 
 You're moving too fast, baby you're moving too fast, slow down 
 Baby slow down, baby slow down, slow down, slow down 
 Baby slow down, baby slow down, slow down, slow down.
