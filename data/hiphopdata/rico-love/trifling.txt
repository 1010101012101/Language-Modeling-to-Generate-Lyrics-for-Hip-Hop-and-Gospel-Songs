I guess we both on that bullshit, I guess we both on that bullshit 
 Turn the lights on 
 Oops, I almost told your boyfriend that I love you, I'm just playing 
 Oops, I almost grabbed your hand last time I saw you 
 Cause Ion even know your nigga like that, you be with some girls who know my girl but that's all though 
 Call hang up, and you hit me right back, that's that bullshit, we both on bullshit 
 We should get a room somewhere 
 Where there's just me and you somewhere, pick and choose somewhere 
 So much we can do somewhere 
 We both got so much to lose somewhere, ocean views somewhere 
 Crazy how it turns to something 
 Knowing that we dead wrong 
 Especially, when we act like nothing happen 
 Put our clothes back on and head home, damn

 You can rub my back somewhere 
 I'll be grabbing on your ass somewhere, acting bad somewhere 
 A whole lot of cash somewhere 
 We'll be tearing up the ave somewhere, shopping bags somewhere 
 Crazy how it turns to something 
 Knowing that we dead wrong 
 Especially, when we act like nothing happen
