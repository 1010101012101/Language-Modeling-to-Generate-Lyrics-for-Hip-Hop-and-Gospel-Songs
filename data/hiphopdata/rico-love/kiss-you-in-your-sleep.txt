I know you're missin' me like crazy 
 It's like the pictures just don't do no good 
 But if you close your eyes I know you can hear me 
 You'll forever be my baby, I'd take you on this journey if I could 
 I can't do it 
 So I'll kiss you in your sleep 
 Hold you by the hand 
 Sit and watch you breathe 
 Our love will never end 
 I'll kiss you in your sleep 
 I hope you'll underestand 
 That heavens calling me 
 But I'll see you again 
 See how the winds been blowin' lately 
 You would swear that somethin's in the air 
 You can feel my heart when the thunders rollin' 
 The earth beaneath you starts to quake, yeah 
 That's when you can hear me loud and clear 
 I'm right there 
 ?????????? You'll see that rain fall down 
 Those are my tears, so don't you cover your head, 
 Smile instead 
 Because I'll kiss you in your sleep 
 Hold you by the hand 
 Sit and watch you breathe 
 Our love will never end 
 I'll kiss you in your sleep 
 I hope you'll underestand 
 That heavens calling me 
 But I'll see you again 
 Just 'cause I'm not here don't mean by love is gone 
 For I'll shower you with kisses from my heart 
 So I'll kiss you in your sleep 
 I hope you'll underestand 
 That heavens calling me 
 But I'll see you again 
 So I'll kiss you in your sleep 
 Hold you by the hand 
 Sit and watch you breathe 
 Our love will never end 
 I'll kiss you in your sleep 
 I hope you'll underestand 
 That heavens calling me 
 But I'll see you again
