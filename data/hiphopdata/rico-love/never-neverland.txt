Feels like they ripped down my heart 
 That day they broke us apart 
 But it just keeps on bleeding 
 Ands it's like I'm heavily medicated 
 Now that we are separated 
 Tell me the reason 
 So each night I wish on a star 
 Begging that all mighty Lord 
 To come restore my breathing 
 'Cause since you've been gone 
 It's like I'm lifeless 
 Can't go on like this baby 
 I wish I could escape to never neverland 
 Some secret faraway place that I'll be better there 
 Living without you 
 I wish I could escape to never neverland 
 Some secret place beyond the moon 
 Prepared for me and you 
 Off to never neverland (4x) 
 I look at pictures of us 
 And Remember how it was then my soul keeps on bleeding 
 And baby I'm still dedicated 
 I believe we can make it 
 Just keep believing 
 And we can basically touch 
 But still I love you so much 
 'Cause your key holds my freedom 
 And one day I'll be set free from these cuffs ooh 
 I wish I could escape to never neverland 
 Some secret faraway place that I'll be better there 
 Living without you 
 I wish I could escape to never neverland 
 Some secret place beyond the moon 
 Prepared for me and you 
 Off to never neverland (4x) 
 I know you're reaching baby 
 Reaching for my hand 
 And even though you're speechless baby 
 I understand 
 I wish I could escape to never neverland 
 Some secret faraway place that I'll be better there 
 Living without you 
 I wish I could escape to never neverland 
 Some secret place beyond the moon 
 Prepared for me and you 
 Off to never neverland (4x)
