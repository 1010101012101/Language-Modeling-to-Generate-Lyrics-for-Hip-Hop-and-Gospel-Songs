I know you missing me like crazy, it's like them pictures just don't do no good. 
 But if you close your eyes I know you can hear me. 
 You'll forever be my baby, I'd take you on this journey if I could. 
 I can't do it. 
 So I'll kiss you in your sleep, hold you by the hand. 
 Sit and watch you breathe, our love will never end. 
 I'll kiss you in your sleep, I'll hope you understand. 
 That heaven's calling me, but I'll see you again. 
 See how the winds been blowing lately, you would swear that something's in the air. 
 You can feel my heart when the thunder's rolling. The earth beneath it starts to quake and 
 That's when you can hear me loud and clear, I'm right there. 
 So whenever you see that rain fall down those are my tears, so don't you cover your head. Smile instead. 
 Because I'll kiss you in your sleep, hold you by the hand. 
 Sit and watch you breathe, our love will never end. 
 I'll kiss you in your sleep, I hope you'll understand. 
 That heaven's calling me, it's calling me oh. I'll see you again. 
 Just 'cause I'm not here don't mean my love is gone, oh. I'll shower you with kisses from my heart, heart. 
 And so I'll kiss you in your sleep, hope you'll understand. 
 That heaven's calling me, its calling me oh. I'll see you again. 
 So I'll kiss you in your sleep, hold you by the hand. 
 Sit and watch you breathe, our love will never end. 
 I'll kiss you in your sleep, I hope you'll understand. 
 That heaven's calling me, it's calling me oh. I'll see you again.
