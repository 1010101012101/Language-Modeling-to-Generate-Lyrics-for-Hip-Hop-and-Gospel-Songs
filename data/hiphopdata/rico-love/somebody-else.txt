Yeah 
 Turn the lights on 
 It feels a way I can't explain so hold me babe, I know you can't stay too long 
 And every melody has a way to remind me that one is your favorite song 
 And I know we can't turn back time 
 I know we can't ride those roads 
 But at least inside my mind it doesn't feel like you're gone 
 Even thou I know you're too busy lovin' somebody else 
 And you're a million miles past gone 
 I wish my bed was warm but you lovin' somebody else 
 You can hear my heart saying, saying 
 Oh say 
 Oh say 
 Oh say 
 Are you lovin' somebody else? 
 You can hear my heart saying 
 Oh say 
 Oh say 
 Oh say 
 'Cause you lovin' somebody else?(somebody else) 
 When I see your face I start to break 
 I love you babe, it's hard to keep stay strong 
 'Cause it's take straight to keep from crying, wish I knew how to now hold on (damn) 
 And I know we can't turn back time 
 I know we can't ride those roads 
 But at least inside my mind 
 Even thou I know you're too busy lovin' somebody else 
 And you're a million miles past gone 
 I wish my bed was warm but you lovin' somebody else (oh baby) 
 You can hear my heart saying 
 Oh say 
 Oh say 
 Oh say 
 Are you lovin' somebody else? 
 You can hear my heart saying 
 Oh say 
 Oh say 
 Oh say 
 'Cause you lovin' somebody else?(somebody else) 
 You say I treat you like your ex did 
 So you screaming f this, being to the exit 
 They say love is like chess, well I've been playing checkers and t you was playing 
 Tetrix 
 Complicated and way too many levels 
 Too many skeletons in my closet, way too many devils 
 Too many elephants in the room, I need a shovel 
 To my new dula (?) all we do is to settle 
 Arguments about, all my wear about 
 All the girls I was with, all the reason that I'mma be without 
 But I'm honest enough to admit, I shoulda honor you blush 
 The material stuff there's hard enough 
 Now when I'm calling it's like I'm calling for what 
 Now I know I shouda buy me a tux 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Even thou I know you're too busy lovin' somebody else 
 And you're a million miles past gone 
 I wish my bed respond but you lovin' somebody else 
 You can hear my heart saying (uuh, uuh), saying (uuh, uuh) 
 Are you lovin' somebody else? 
 You can hear my heart (uuh, uuh), saying (uuh, uuh) 
 'Cause you lovin' somebody else?(somebody else)
