What are we fighting for, 
 Why do we even bother 
 We don't see eye to eye no more 
 This house is tearing apart 
 I know love ain't fair 
 I know it ain't perfect 
 But I can't be here 
 'Cause you're love ain't worth it 
 A part of me's scared 
 A part of me's searching 
 This is how it sounds when my heart crys 
 Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh 
 And you won't even come to my rescue 
 Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh (I'm crying for you baby) 
 This is the soundtrack to my broken heart 
 What are you screaming for 
 What does it even matter 
 When you walking out that door 
 My heart is breaking in half 
 I know love ain't fair (ain't fair) 
 I know it ain't perfect (oh) 
 But I can't be here 
 'Cause you're love ain't worth it 
 A part of me scared 
 A part of me searching 
 This is how it sounds when my heart cry's 
 Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh 
 And you won't even come to my rescue 
 Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh (I'm crying for you baby) 
 This is the soundtrack to my broken heart 
 You see me drowning but you won't save... my... life 
 I'm dying baby, my best is never enough 
 To keep you happy 
 So listen to the sound of my broken heart 
 Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh 
 And you won't even come to my rescue 
 Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh (I'm crying for you baby) 
 This is the soundtrack to my broken heart
