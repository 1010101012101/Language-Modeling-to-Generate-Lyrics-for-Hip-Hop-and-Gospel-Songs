She came twice, I came last 
 She came twice, I came last 
 Watch this! 
 Don't want the brag about what I do 
 Oh, oh, all of the ways that I please you 
 Wont tell my prince, Ill put it down 
 I ain't gonna say shit 
 I'm sure that they will figure it out, 
 After a while! 
 (Turn the lights on!) 
 One bottle, four hands, two bodies and three orgasms 
 (She came twice, I came last) 
 Two for you, one for me, it's all I need! 
 One bottle, four hands, two bodies and three orgasms 
 (She came twice, I came last) 
 Two for you, one for me, it's all I need! 
 One bottle, four hands, two bodies and three orgasms 
 (She came twice, I came last) 
 Two for you, one for me, it's all I need! 
 (She came twice, I came last) 
 Oh yeah, impressed with all my efforts, 
 Not a single part will be neglected 
 Applying a certain amount of pressure 
 Most niggas got them lectures! 
 Whole lot of words 
 I don't say shit, I just play the record. 
 And I study your world, studied it real hard, 
 Trying to make it look great, 
 But any crazy, I give you the deeds, 
 The only way to make straight As. 
 Wait for it! 
 Your body got a nigga schooled, 
 You see the way I am at your face, 
 Got me showing up at your place 
 I just hope that you think about me 
 (When you're masturbating!) 
 One bottle, four hands, two bodies and three orgasms 
 (She came twice, I came last) 
 Two for you, one for me, it's all I need! 
 One bottle, four hands, two bodies and three orgasms 
 (She came twice, I came last) 
 Two for you, one for me, it's all I need! 
 One bottle, four hands, two bodies and three orgasms 
 (She came twice, I came last) 
 Two for you, one for me, it's all I need! 
 (She came twice, I came last) 
 I don't got a bunch for you, you know what I mean? 
 I don't got a whole spill, hold that shit you talk about! 
 I'm just saying, try, nigga! 
 You know where I'll be at? 
 Imma get comfortable for you 
 Got a bottle with whatever you want. 
 (She came twice, I came last) 
 And try the desert! 
 Its love! You know what I do? 
 Turn the lights on! 
 One bottle, four hands, two bodies and three orgasms 
 (She came twice, I came last) 
 Two for you, one for me, it's all I need! 
 One bottle, four hands, two bodies and three orgasms 
 (She came twice, I came last) 
 Two for you, one for me, it's all I need! 
 One bottle, four hands, two bodies and three orgasms 
 (She came twice, I came last) 
 Two for you, one for me, it's all I need!
