We're all watching the game with your friends like every night 
 I guess they were more fun than we are 
 Isn't it kinda strange? that you always start a fight 
 Maybe that's your excuse to leave ?'cause 
 Everything's changed, things are now clear 
 Messing with my brain, u don't hug me 
 You're to blame ?'cause you don't love me finally I see that 
 You're so lame 
 Can't believe that I ever fell in love with you (you're so lame) 
 Damn I was so stupid 
 You're so lame 
 How would I let you play me like a fool? 
 You're so... 
 You're so lame 
 Can't believe that I ever fell in love with you (u so lame) 
 Damn I was so stupid 
 You're so lame 
 How would I let you play me like a fool (let you play me up like a fool) 
 You're so...
