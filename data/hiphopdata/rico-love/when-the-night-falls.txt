Turn the lights on 
 Your heart, my hands, safety, my arms 
 Right here, I stand, to protect you from harm 
 And just when you thought running away 
 Is the only thing that you could do 
 I came to protect you from the rain 
 Just call my name 
 When the night falls (when the night falls) 
 In the darkness I'll be waiting 
 There in the shadow (shadow) 
 When you come I'll find a way to get to you 
 I'll find a way, I'll find a way 
 I'll find a way to get to you 
 I'll find a way, I'll find a way, I'll find a way 
 My kiss, your face, my home, your heart 
 Nothing can rephrase my love, wont be far 
 And just when you thought I wouldn't stay 
 I'm standing here right at your door, yeah 
 I'm here to keep the danger away 
 So you won't fear 
 When the night falls (when the night falls) 
 In the darkness I'll be waiting 
 There in the shadow (shadow) 
 When you come I'll find a way to get to you 
 I'll find a way, I'll find a way 
 I'll find a way to get to you 
 I'll find a way, I'll find a way, I'll find a way 
 When your sleep round head back those unfamiliar faces 
 You can find comfort in my, sweet warm embraces, yeah 
 So fear not, my love is here to save you 
 Save you from the dark 
 When the night falls (when the night falls) 
 In the darkness I'll be waiting 
 There in the shadow (shadow) 
 When you come I'll find a way to get to you 
 I'll find a way, I'll find a way 
 I'll find a way to get to you 
 I'll find a way, I'll find a way, I'll find a way
