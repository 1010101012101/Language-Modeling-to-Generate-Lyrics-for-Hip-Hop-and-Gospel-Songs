I spend all my nights waiting for your call 
 It feels like don'cha? 
 Pictures of us hanging on my wall, I can't take them down 
 It's like our thoughts are pieces of heaven 
 And wind just keeping blew them away 
 Never seize that day I've been waiting you to come back to me 
 I don't care if you jump through the clouds, swim through the oceans 
 Run through the valleys as long as you get here 
 'Cause I need you now, I can't take it when you're gone 
 But don't take the long way home, don't take the long way home 
 Don't take the long way home 
 I swear sometimes I can see your face 
 Just for a second 
 Waited so too long for your want me ways 
 Get here somehow, yeah 
 I feel like our thoughts were pieces of heaven 
 And wind just came and blew them away 
 Never seize that day I've been waiting you to come back to me 
 I don't care if you jump through the clouds, swim through the oceans 
 Run through the valleys as long as you get here 
 'Cause I need you now, I can't take it when you're gone 
 But don't take the long way home, don't take the long way home 
 Don't take the long way home 
 Can you hear me calling, calling, baby I need you 
 Can you hear me calling, calling, baby I need you 
 I don't care if you jump through the clouds, swim through the oceans 
 Run through the valleys as long as you get here 
 'Cause I need you now, I can't take it when you're gone 
 But don't take the long way home, don't take the long way home 
 Don't take the long way home.
