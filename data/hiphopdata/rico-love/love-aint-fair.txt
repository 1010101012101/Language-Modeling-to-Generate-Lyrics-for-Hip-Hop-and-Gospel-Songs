I'm here 
 You're there 
 The pain's hard to bare 
 Daydreams 
 Blank stares 
 Can't rhyme from my nightmares 
 Still tryna to pick up the pieces 
 And put together the parts that keep me alive 
 I, draw smiley faces on the dirt on the road, picture you laughing but I'm still so alone 
 Wrap myself in memories when I'm cold 
 But you're not here and I swear 
 Love just ain't fair 
 Darkness 
 No light 
 Can't see 
 Wrong from right 
 No one to guide me 
 To hold me 
 This can't be life 
 Still tryna pick up the pieces 
 And put together the parts that keep me alive 
 Draw smiley faces on the dirt on the road, picture you laughing but I'm still so alone 
 Wrap myself in memories when I'm cold 
 But you're not here I swear 
 Love just ain't fair 
 (Just ain't fair) 
 Love just ain't fair 
 Just ain't fair 
 But you're not here and I swear 
 Love just ain't fair 
 So many nights how I've gone through dreams that I wish could just come true. 
 And these stairs they keep on falling, maybe in the morning I wake up, next to you 
 I draw smiley faces on the dirt on the road, picture you laughing but I'm still so alone 
 Wrap myself in memories when I'm cold 
 But you're not here and I swear 
 Love just ain't fair 
 Love just ain't fair 
 Love just ain't fair
