She packed all the bags this morning 
 Caught the first flight to LA 
 None of my words could keep her 
 Nothing could make her stay 
 Blew out all the candles 
 There's no flame to light my darkest day 
 I know I deserve this torture 
 I know I deserve this pain 
 I know I'm gonna lose you this time 
 But I don't know how to get through this life 
 Without you with me 
 Goodbye would probably kill me 
 I know I'm gonna lose you this time 
 Becuz I told you too many lies 
 I know I'm guilty 
 I lost your love, now I'm losing my mind 
 I know I'm gonna lose you this time yeah 
 A kiss on the face 
 A simple goodbye was all she left me with 
 Didn't have the nerve to stop her 
 Minus the wrong I did 
 There's no fairy tale 
 Didn't think the story would end up like this 
 And I've got enough heartbroken 
 And it's way too hard to fix 
 Oh baby 
 (Turn the lights on) 
 I know I'm gonna lose you this time 
 That's why I ain't putting up a fight 
 'Cause I know you're right baby 
 But baby I know imma lose my mind 
 I never should've left your love behind
