Wish I could turn my hotel into a strip club 
 Turn the lights on 
 () 
 I really think it's time in here (oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah) 
 For me to see you grind in here (oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah) 
 Coming outta my mind in here (oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah) 
 Dallas and Houston and Philly (I see all the coldest strippers in the city) 
 You ain't gotta work there, but I can tell you can swerk, yeah 
 And from the way you been eyein' that pole 
 Make me think you wanna climb that pole 
 You do, don't you? 
 Mixed with two puffs of the gandja, the Hennessy creepin' up on ya 
 We ain't trippin', we just sippin' with the strippers 
 You lookin' at the no.1 tipper, turn the lights on 
 (Pre-) 
 She does it to me errtime I'm in here 
 That's why she spins her leg round when I'm in here 
 I tell the owner he should close the club later 
 'Cause he know that 
 All these girls is tryna make it 
 All these girls is tryna make it 
 Throw that money she'll get naked 
 Girl I know ur trying to make it 
 And I ain't made at u, baby 
 I ain't made at u, baby 
 I'm gon' come through 
 And I'mma spend it all on you 
 Strip club part II, yeah yeah yeah 
 (2) 
 No cheap champagne (oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah) 
 Sittin' in the front, betta tip that stage (oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah) 
 Fallies, DOA, blue flame (oh yeah, oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah) 
 Atlanta, New York and Miami, I treat all 'em girls like they family 
 Blow a band up in Gold Rush, nahwimtalknbout? 
 Find a thick brown skin down to fuck, then I'm walkin' out 
 All up in the mint like I ain't got a cent 
 Up in PT's I be feelin' like a pimp 
 Shit, I'm bout to fuck around and spend a nigga rent 
 Pull up in the drop, shades off, no tint, turn the lights on 
 (Pre-) 
 Yeah, first strip club I eva went to in Atlanta 
 Was blue flame, and my nigga Chi took up in there 
 In D-Town, we got hooked on pin-ups, hehe 
 And went to see the Jazzy-Ts, we was just sittin' in the parkin' lot 
 And post up, shit was crazy back then 
 I remember I seen Sugar fightin' in front of the Gentlemen's Club 
 She beat the shit out a bitch in front the gentlemen's club 
 Hahaha, what was that club, the Gold Club? That shit was crazy 
 I feel like I grew up in the strip club, ya know? 
 I remember the first time I saw White Chocolate 
 It was like on a Wednesday night Amateur Night at Strokers 
 I coulda sworn, I really thought that she was gonna be my wife, fo' real 
 Goosebumps, damn, it's sure crazy 'cause 
 I feel that it's a part of my life, fo' real 
 Turn the lights on!
