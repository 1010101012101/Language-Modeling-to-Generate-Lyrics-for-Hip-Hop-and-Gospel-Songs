Dinner alone, nobody's home 
 No messages on my telephone 
 Just pictures hung up on the wall 
 Oh God, I'm going through withdraws 
 Laying in bed with my TV on 
 But these memories, they won't leave me alone 
 I guess I fall asleep, but then again I won't 
 Floating in circles, feelin' so worthless 
 Then the days go by, and the nights gets longer 
 I thought the craving stopped, but I still want you 
 'Cause when its real it never goes away, it only grows much stronger 
 As the days go by 
 Those days go by, Oh uh yeah 
 Those days go by, Oh uh yeah 
 And it don't get easier to sleep at night 
 Been missing you all this time, as the days go by 
 Who's right or wrong it don't matter now 
 I just need you back some way somehow 
 Sitting imagining your, your smile 
 I had no idea, that I'd be right here, Wow 
 All of the moments that we shared 
 I'll give up everything, I'll buy a wedding ring 
 Wasn't prepared to not have you here 
 Now I'm floating in circles, feelin' so worthless 
 Then days go by, and the nights gets longer 
 I thought the craving stopped, but I still want you 
 'Cause when its real it never goes away, it only grows much stronger 
 As the days go by 
 Those days go by, Oh uh yeah 
 Those days go by, Oh uh yeah 
 And it don't get easier to sleep at night 
 Been missing you all this time, as the days go by 
 Funny how now is the time I decide I wanna be honest 
 Our potential is ahead, the regret is so far behind us 
 And all the BS that I was so good at giving you 
 Was almost criminal, now you sending subliminals 
 All your friends are defending you, pow wowing against me up in my living room 
 Running after birds, what a lame choice 
 Maybe I deserve in my tank voice 
 Cause all them lames you was curving, I'm observing 
 You giving time to them same boys 
 I was living ruthless, but the truth is this last time I ain't even do shit 
 But like the boy who cried wolf, the time he suppose to win is when he loses 
 Then days go by, and the nights gets longer 
 I thought the craving stopped, but I still want you 
 'Cause when its real it never goes away, it only grows much stronger 
 As the days go by 
 Those days go by, Oh uh yeah 
 Those days go by, Oh uh yeah 
 And it don't get easier to sleep at night 
 Been missing you all this time, as the days go by
