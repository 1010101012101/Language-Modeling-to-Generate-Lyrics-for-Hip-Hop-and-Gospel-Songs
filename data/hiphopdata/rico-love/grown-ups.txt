Not tryna put a bunch of pressure on you or nutin' but uh 
 I don't even drink champagne 
 What 'chu think all of this is for? 
 So tell your homegirl you gon' be all right 
 And make your way to my room 
 I'm pretty sure they'll hate on me tonight 
 But it's cool, 'cause we gon' do the things that grown-ups do 
 Harlem in the house 
 Harlem in the house 
 Harlem in the house 
 Harlem in the house 
 Now I can be your lover, brother or be multi-facet 
 I can do, anything if you will ever ask it 
 I can dress hood if you want me, switch up! 
 Now I can be suited and booted, or can mix it up 
 I can make you feel as if I'm the only? 
 I can keep a job mami, I can work a shift 
 I can bring you soup and orange juice, if you really sick 
 Or I can put a rose in my mouth and bring a gift 
 I want you out the hood for good 
 I want you on your feet 
 I want you being e'rything you thought you couldn't see 
 I want your mind as free as a dolphin in the sea 
 I want your intimacy, look into me and see 
 C'mon, you know them hits from top 40 
 Got my house? a walkie talkie 
 All these bad chicks bore me 
 You the only shorty for me ha! 
 Don't say, what you won't do 
 Cause these hours, are reserved for grown-ups 
 And it's been a lot of money spent because of you 
 At this time of night 
 The only thing left to do 
 Is tell your homegirl you gon' be all right 
 And make your way to my room 
 I'm pretty sure they'll hate on me tonight 
 But it's cool, 'cause we gon' do the things that grown-ups do 
 Bronx in the house 
 BX in the house 
 French Montana, Coke Boys in the house 
 Hol' up, slo' up, fedz roll up 
 Niggas starving. Coke boys and the girls doin' donuts 
 30 thousand over there, 30 models over there 
 When you talk about feet, 30 thousand in the air 
 I'm a coke boy, she cum second to the blow 
 Gotta break her back, she won't love me when I'm broke 
 Versace Dom, feel free you like shocking huh? 
 60 seconds or less & I'll be gone 
 Hundred carats on my piece, I promise I'll never lease 
 I'm married to the streets so I'm carried off the streets ha 
 I'm not the one to have you on a lease sign 
 Keeping it 100, 100 thousand dollar piece on 
 I get low on blocks, niggas go police on 
 And when them bands pop, I don't need a refund 
 Don't say, what you won't do 
 Cause these hours, are reserved for grown-ups 
 And it's been a lot of money spent because of you 
 At this time of night 
 The only thing left to do 
 Is tell your homegirl you gon' be all right 
 And make your way to my room 
 I'm pretty sure they'll hate on me tonight 
 But it's cool, 'cause we gon' do the things that grown-ups do 
 The millest in this bitch, I'm the prezzie ho 
 Prezzie row, 50k for the bezzie though 
 Rico Love, we ain't even know you could rap 
 She said you let me in your section and you could tap 
 Hundred bottles in the club, you could Google that 
 Fliest nigga on the fucking globe, check Google maps 
 Lame at the bar but your girl up in here 
 And I think she wanna show me her le pearl of Brazil, yeah! 
 A fuck nigga's worst nightmare 
 Fuck a bad bitch, I'm only paying flight fare 
 These hoes tell a mayne, go and get the jury form 
 Posting pictures on the web, with your jury on 
 (Bitch) Tryna kill a nigga vibe, word to Kendrick 
 My wardrobe makes 4 perfect entries 
 The kind of name that it never hurts to mention 
 The size of my tip, should tell you my intention so 
 Don't say, what you won't do 
 Cause these hours, are reserved for grown-ups 
 And it's been a lot of money spent because of you 
 At this time of night 
 The only thing left to do 
 Is tell your homegirl you gon' be all right 
 And make your way to my room 
 I'm pretty sure they'll hate on me tonight 
 But it's cool, 'cause we gon' do the things that grown-ups do
