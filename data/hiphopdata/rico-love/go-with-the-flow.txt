You wont believe it what I'm gonna do to your body tonight 
 If I told you I just hope you're ready baby 
 I just you're ready for the ride 
 You gonna have the time of your life babe 
 Ooh, ooh I'ma do you right girl 
 All night girl we can go, go 
 Right now 
 Go with the flow night babe 
 Go with the flow night babe 
 Even if it means you won't need your clothes tonight babe 
 Go with the flow 
 Just because you ain't no girl 
 Babe that don't mean you are a hoe 
 Especially if its on the low 
 Baby Go with the floor night babe 
 And it might feel good 
 I don't see number grow people 
 I don't see number grow people 
 And if the hoes is judging you then maybe you with the wrong people 
 Vegas nights and Miami mornings 
 New York shopping, LA performance 
 My dick so good, it fit so good 
 You forget any nigga that you have before me 
 Fuck that shit why miss out 
 Take them shots, pull tits out 
 Kiss your home girl on the mouth and if she tripping put that bitch out 
 Gotta a big house let a rooms pick one 
 I know you wanna get done 
 You met a lot of niggas on the club tonight 
 But you end up nigga with a rich one 
 With my own job no Tommy 
 Tonight I ain't got no Bonnie 
 I check that box Barrack 
 But I have enough bread to vote Romney 
 Its early enough for breakfast but its late enough to stay low 
 So come about the clothes and show and go 
 Go with the flow night babe 
 Go with the flow night babe 
 Even if it means you won't need your clothes tonight babe 
 Go with the flow 
 Just because you ain't no good girl 
 Baby that don't mean you are a hoe 
 Especially if its on the low 
 Baby go with the flow night babe 
 And it just might feel good
