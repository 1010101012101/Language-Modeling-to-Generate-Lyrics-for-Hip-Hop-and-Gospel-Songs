The hardest thing for me is to leave your body, baby 
 Even though I know that I'ma be with you later on today! 
 Cause all I wanna do, girl I see your pretty face, 
 ...Together, I'm hurting baby! 
 'Cause I can't keep my hands off you! 
 (Can't keep my hands off you!) 
 Cause no one gives love like you do! 
 You do something beautiful! 
 You open your eyes, 
 Everything seems right! 
 You do something beautiful, yeah! 
 Hellos and goodbyes, 
 The words that saved my life, 
 You do something, 
 Do something, do something, do something 
 Do something, do something, do something 
 Beautiful! 
 I go on my mind ... that you're here for... 
 You kiss me every time I feel so lucky having you around! 
 How can I sit down when you make all sexy sounds? 
 Your kiss, your touching, your love, is killing me now! 
 Yeah! 
 'Cause I can't keep my hands off you! 
 (I can't keep my hands off you!) 
 Cause no one gives love like you do! 
 Baby you do something beautiful! 
 You open your eyes, 
 Everything seems right! 
 You do something beautiful, yeah! 
 Hellos and goodbyes, 
 Once they saved my life, 
 You do something, 
 Do something, do something, do something 
 Do something, do something, do something 
 Beautiful!
