 Put me in the freezer 'cause I'm so icy (2) 
 Put me in the freezer, put me put me in the freezer, p-p-put me in the freezer 'cause I'm so icy (repeat) 
 Verse 1 (Baby D): 
 Its baby D, Gucci shawty low we gotta be a hit 
 I walk up in the club chain hangin' to my dick 
 I know that I'm the shit, so haters start talkin' down on me 
 Keep a full pound on me so keep 'em down homie 
 'Bout a half a mill on me look at my wrist 
 The whole interstar don't shine like this 
 Bitch I'm rich gotta in glu watch 
 Put me in the freezer, 'cause I'm so hott 
 I'm so icy from my head to my feet 
 That I don't ride, I glide down the streets 
 These chains ain't cheap, these frames ain't cheap 
 If you ain't talkin' bout money shawty then don't speak 
 Put me in the freezer right next to the beef 
 My chain 56s grams to oz's 
 Take them shades down then you can clearly see 
 That errybody in the A icy like me
