I was born... 
 I was born... 
 I was born... 
 I was born in a concrete jungle 
 And I learned to make my own way (learned to make my own way) 
 I was raised by streets and the beats 
 And the books and crooks of l.a. 
 I was taken by the power of the word 
 And I had a whole lot to say (had a whole lot to say) 
 And I vowed, always to move the crowd 
 And leave 'em in disarray 
 'Cause I live by the word and I die by the sword 
 These here are strange days and we here are strong 
 We live by the sword and we die by the slug 
 This here is war and this here is love 
 Soldiers are marching in 
 And they're going to battle again 
 Somebody's going to win 
 And somebody will lose -- and that's the truth! 
 Gotta learn to fight for yours 
 Livin' in this life of yours 
 See they can't stifle yours 
 If you refuse to abused, fools listen to this news 
 I don't beg, steal or borrow 
 I don't expect to see tomorrow 
 I don't usually soak in sorrow 
 'Cause I keep all eyes on the sparrow 
 'Cause we live by the word and we die by the sword 
 These here are strange days and we here are strong 
 We live by the sword and we die by the slug 
 This here is war and this here is love 
 Soldiers are marching in 
 And they going to battle again 
 Somebody's going to win 
 And somebody will lose -- and that's the real! 
 Gotta learn to fight for yours 
 Livin' in this life of yours 
 See they can't stifle yours 
 If you refuse to abused, fools listen to this news 
 Uh-huh, fools listen to this news 
 Whashup, crews listen to this news 
 Oh yeah, you listen to this news 
 Listen, listen, listen, to this news
