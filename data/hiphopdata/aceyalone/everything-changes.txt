It was so beautiful 
 Remember how in love we were? 
 So in love, so in love, once 
 So in love, once 
 She was a young girl, I was a young man 
 And I knew they would get her when I let go her hand 
 And then I let go the inevitable 
 So beautiful and susceptible 
 So wonderful and so innocent 
 And after this neither one of us would benefit 
 Yeah, I was a dropout, she was a graduate 
 She said I'll never be nothing, she wasn't having it 
 Yeah, I tried to break her down, I tried to reason it 
 She said I wasn't nobody to be believing in 
 Yeah, what a waste of time, what a waste of mind 
 Your place of mind was a part of the design 
 Yeah, I used to call her up, she never called back 
 Then when she called that said I wasn't all that 
 Yeah, I know that times change and people change too 
 I was a fool just to think that I could change you 
 Everyone's got stories gone about a love we once knew 
 So high in the beginning until the world cuts through 
 And then everything changes, nothing feels the same 
 Piece by piece it falls apart until all that's left is blame 
 And if I had a chance to do it all over 
 I'd do it exactly the same 
 I was a b-boy, she was a good girl 
 Turned hot girl, had to be a hood girl 
 Never did she notice she would end up in a shook world 
 I was like, look girl, it's all in the book 
 Yeah, I used to tell her jokes, I used to make her laugh 
 And if I had a whole dollar I would give her half 
 So delicate and so intelligent 
 And then she trying to play me out just for the hell of it 
 Back when she was 19 not even 21 
 Used to do a thing getting somebody anyone 
 Thought that she was naive or was it really me 
 I do believe she was the one that was fulfilling me 
 So we broke up at a barbecue 
 I drove home thinking never will I bother you 
 Yeah, I just didn't know what it was hidden for 
 She had me sitting low but she was bullshitting, though 
 Everyone's got stories gone about a love we once knew 
 So high in the beginning until the world cuts through 
 Everything changes, nothing feels the same 
 Piece by piece it falls apart until all that's left is blame 
 So I just kept rhyming, I caught her eye again 
 Next thing you know, she was hollering, let's try again 
 But I wasn't buying in, didn't want to lie again 
 Love was in the frying pan, baby, it's done 
 But she started hanging out and started being seen 
 Seeing things different, said she wasn't being mean 
 Yeah, if I let her in then I let her win 
 But I'm a veteran, what's better than a friend 
 Maybe she was an angel but she's in disguise 
 And I just didn't see the God-light in her eyes 
 Or maybe I should I walk away and cut the ties 
 Stay on the rise, leave love left where love dies 
 We were youngsters but we're older now 
 You know the world is a little more colder now 
 And I'm just trying to get it all off my shoulder now 
 Baby, you can hold it down, I'll see you in the wind 
 Everyone's got stories gone about a love we once knew 
 So high in the beginning until the world cuts through 
 And then everything changes, nothing feels the same 
 Piece by piece it falls apart until all that's left is blame 
 That's right, baby, next life time 
 Yeah, ain't that what they say? 
 Check it out, love don't hate 
 I got love for you, always
