Aceyalone: 
 It's the audio ????? dynamics 
 Don't panic, frantic 
 Put me in the middle and I'll battle, fight 'em off 
 Manic depresent for sonic 
 Embelishment 
 Nuts and bolts and millions of volts and concrete 
 And asphalt 
 It's the end of the world and your fault 
 Waiting for someone to open the gate 
 Clean slate 
 Greens on your plate 
 And still have no control over your fate 
 You masturbate, ejaculate, stale mate, stuck 
 Spoon Iodine: 
 What the fuck? 
 Abbracadabra 
 You'll get flushed in a falling Niagra 
 Gush 
 And gore 
 Is what you in for 
 The only Clinton that I listen to is George 
 Speak of the devil, one world president 
 Rebels hesitent, check, change 
 Another nail in the coffin 
 Beware of the false prophet 
 And the angels with the last seven plauges 
 Elves, they'll carve your eyes and nose into a pattern 
 Your head is now an orniment 
 A jack-o-lantern 
 Typical ????? state 
 Oh my god, I'm aetheist for Christ sake 
 Never let us catch you 
 Worshipping any statues 
 Or the mark of the beast 
 Any tattooed foreheads 
 Branded, God can't stand it 
 Showing you his last name ain't Dammit 
 One fled, but now he's dead 
 I subtracted three sixes from the back of his head 
 Dedicated niggas wanna die 
 Iodine 
 Riddlore: 
 An ocean, front, line and center for inspection 
 Private, what type of style is that? 
 'Uh... what do you mean, sir?" 
 I mean, what type of style do you ??? MCs call your self carriers of? 
 I can't like an aquarian type of style, did you have one? 
 Specific of mind there's an ocean 
 Pacific of mine, sir', uh... dismissed 
 Private Fish 
 I like to see them offers 
 Now we're not gonna have any of this 
 Starfish, Halibut Hardfish 
 Do you understand me? 
 'Yes, sir' 
 I can't hear you 
 'Yes sir!' 
 NGA Fish: 
 And when it come to new styles, few style like I do love 
 To style 
 Ooh, whooo are theeese MCs 
 With their filthy paws on my silky drawers 
 Styles up from the bottom of my well while 
 While suckas put their ear to that NGA Fish shelter 
 Hear a new style, a 32 style in mono 
 I know, it seems that maybe you - kinda over - looked it 
 But nigga you knew that style was dangerous when you took it 
 B-b-b- bust blast 
 Dearly beloved 
 We're gathered here today to pay our final respects 
 To this newly departed style 
 It was a good style 
 It died so young 
 Why so young? 
 Snatched from the tip of a tongue 
 In it's prime 
 This rhyme'll rhyme 
 Crime 
 Gotta stop, but I can't 
 'Cause I master styles 
 ????? Your styles to pass it faster than expected (expected) 
 Eclectic... uh 
 Rejected... uh 
 Collect it... uh 
 Disected... uh 
 This is what dreams are made of... NIGGA! 
 Me being able to say what I really wanna 
 Yeah you ain't gonna 
 Shoot, shoot then 
 Shoot me, don't shoot them 
 Shoot 
 You talk shit like your mouth was a doop chute, duke 
 I'm about to nuke your small planet and turn everyone who looks at me to 
 Granite 
 Oh my where am I? 
 I need stills my legs are too high 
 My arms are too short I need crutches 
 I need help!
