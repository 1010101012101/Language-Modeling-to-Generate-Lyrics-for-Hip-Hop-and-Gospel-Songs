(Chorus One) 
 Heads and Woes 
 Heads and Wo-oes 
 Heads and Woes 
 Heads and Wo-oes 
 Headtrips, Headtrips 
 I think it is, I know it is 
 (Chorus Two) 
 I got a head full of headaches a heart that's full of woes 
 I'm constantly singin' them downhome blues and not many people knows 
 That leaves me with a twisted view of the whole wide world as I know it 
 And I guess I got no choice but to be a poet 
 (Verse One) 
 Now in my natural habitat I gravitate towards cribs 
 And I elevate on having that 
 And I'll never get caught by the frills 
 From Yellowstone to Venezuela 
 Nigeria to the hills 
 There's somethin' I learned that I gotta tell ya 
 Brother's like me got skills 
 Now I could been your doctor or your lawyer 
 Or come to your house and build 
 Self destruction won't destroy ya 
 If you know how to use that shield 
 Men are murdered and that's their fate 
 And to get it on tape is a thrill 
 And people elsewhere tryin' to escape 
 Just to come to America and chill 
 Helicopters scope the land 
 See you makin' your ghetto plan 
 Hip-hop culture is African 
 And I ain't never going back to the fields 
 (Chorus Two) 
 (Verse Two) 
 Now everyday I manifest and I generate and smoke cannabis 
 And I penetrate and I innovate and I demonstrate from the west 
 From Amsterdam to the Northern border 
 Panama Spain to Atlanta Georgia 
 Somethin' I learned that I haven't told ya 
 Cause everybody's goin' through stress 
 Now I know you know it ain't who you know but tell me do you know yourself 
 Cause you can go just like any John Doe 
 But I know you ain't thinkin' about death 
 So if you're straight and you're narrow and the snake's in the barrel 
 And the serpent is under the rainbow 
 And you don't really got not angle 
 And you're head over heels instead of the reals 
 Then you're bound to be tangled 
 Cause brothers are singin' and dancin' and rappin' 
 And cappin' each other and tryin' to survive 
 But knowledge is a fact 
 You ain't comin' back 
 And you won't get out of life alive 
 (Chorus One) 
 (Chorus Two) 
 (Chorus One) 
 (Verse Three) 
 Now I got this diamond in my eye 
 Symbolizing the way that I'm rising 
 Exercising and shining like a pearl 
 Linin all the planets up and rhymin to the world 
 There's a reason why I had to be an individual 
 Instead of running with a pack 
 'Cause the lone wolf never get his hoof scoofed 
 If he got his own back 
 I got my own back 
 Now... 
 If you ever had a migraine in your brain 
 And the pain of a million people walking in the flame 
 Some stain in the streets of the veins of a body called city 
 And the body's locked in the streets of vein 
 Ain't that a pity 
 Itty bitty game 
 And the heart of the ghetto pumpin' through life through your organs 
 Even though I know you know 
 My head is achin', I'm awakened, I ain't fakin' 
 And the woes is takin' they tolls 
 And the woes is takin' they tolls 
 And the ways of the world and the universe swirls 
 And the woes is takin' they tolls 
 (Chorus One)
