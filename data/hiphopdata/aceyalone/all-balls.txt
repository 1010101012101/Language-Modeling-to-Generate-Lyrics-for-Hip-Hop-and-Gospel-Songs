Yeah, say what 
 Now, how the god damn pot go and call the kettle black? 
 That bull shit 
 Yo, but this ain't though 
 Chapter seven, verse one, attention 
 All balls don't bounce, some balls roll and some balls hang 
 And some people have a ball doin' they thang 
 Now what's the result? Your life is biased 
 All one-sided, surrounded by liars 
 Trials and tribs 
 It's all ad-libs and all breakin' you a coupla ribs 
 Now what if I breaks the tail on the lizard 
 Is it gonna grow back? It is and you know that 
 But that ain't the case, I picture the place 
 I capture a Kodak and show dat face 
 You're just a shit stain on the draws of life 
 And the trials of life and the styles of life 
 You won't be happy 'til you lost your life 
 Or lose your mind, or die of boredom 
 Or try to kill 'em all and let your God sort 'em 
 Better earn your keep and learn to leap or burn in your sleep 
 Tryin' to get a little somethin', yo, I peep 
 You bein' devoted 
 But you shoulda let it seep 
 Through the mask you sported 
 You ended up a swiggler caught in a swiggle 
 Just gimme the signal and I'll state the terms 
 As long as I can be there with fate to change 
 You smokin' sherm 
 Or whatever the name, you're a trivial part in a trivia game 
 Now what's your aim? A presidential campaign 
 Like Ross Perot, he lost it though 
 But he got a billion in da bank for show 
 Oh, me, I'm po' and you like me 
 But I don't like you, nigga, you all fronts 
 And I won't let one apple spoil the bunch 
 Now get yo' hat and get yo' coat 
 All afloat, we goin' back to the real 
 I got a question, answer me this 
 What if me and you got caught in a twist 
 And you accidentally got caught by the fist? 
 What's the gist, or what's the justice 
 Or better yet, what if I had got busted 
 For tryin' to go out like General Custer? 
 Well, kiss yo' family, meet me at the juncture 
 Better have a little bit a acupuncture 
 I reckon that you gonna have to smoke another bongload 
 To get you enough 
 To open your mouth 
 Because I doubt that you know what it's really about 
 All balls don't bounce, some balls roll and some balls hang 
 And some people have a ball doin' they thang 
 Now what's the result? Your life is biased 
 All one-sided, surrounded by liars 
 Heard you keep your jewels in a safe 
 That ain't safe with a ten-dollar locket 
 I keep mines in between my front pockets 
 'Cause I'm a darkie and they want me 
 Castrated, assassinated, well, here's your merit 
 Better wear it with pride, just don't get all mushy inside 
 And don't get pushy or wishy washy, your heart is squishy 
 When it should be strong, your tail is bushy 
 When you shouldn't even have one 
 Do you want another big hit of the bong? 
 All balls don't bounce, now you wanna get indignant 
 Show your stupidity and act all ig'nant 
 Now you got pigment, so you my kin 
 It's like the hand, it's still on ice 
 So you might starve tryin' to carve you a slice 
 With a little brown rice and some black eye peas 
 Or two black eyes and two broke knees 
 And two broke niggas tryin' to steal the cheese 
 Got family ties, your family's giving 
 Your family tries, your family's living 
 Your family croaks, dies of a stroke 
 And that's the end 
 But then you awoke 
 As a baby again 
 So in your next life, you can be squabbler 
 And eat peach cobbler till you get fat 
 You can even live in a mansion or a wigwam
