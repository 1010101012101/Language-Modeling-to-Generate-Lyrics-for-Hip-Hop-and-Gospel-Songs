The more I look around the more it hurts 
 My livelihook is poisoned my works 
 Fall on deaf ears a messenger bringer 
 With a foreign face and 
 Tongue and 
 Slightly 
 Twisted view of this time and space 
 Space cadet ace 
 Reporting from base 
 The water hasn't a taste 
 The time and the place 
 The paper, the chase the race 
 Again 
 Manifestation, reva-lation-lution 
 Retro-bution solution 
 My people are poor community war 
 What's the rivalry for? 
 The poor can't afford 
 Self genocide 
 Help 'em aside 
 He's on your side of the fight 
 Yep, but unfortunately 
 Unproportionately out of order 
 We have kaos 
 Kaos to order they're closing the border 
 It's a flip of the quarter 
 For the players, existing in this game 
 I'm sensing a change 
 That all will come to pass 
 Then a movement of the mass 
 But who am I to tell on who will prevail 
 And who's fail and who in the hell 
 Are you going to tell? 
 You're new to the trail 
 Your doomed to sail 
 Away 
 Keep watching your backs 
 And cover your tracks 
 Get up on the facts and relax 
 And as the dust settles another one bites 
 He fights but he lost his life device 
 He's iced my advice 
 Don't play unless you plan to pay the price 
 The more I look around the more it hurts (x5) 
 I quiety go berserk when I work 
 Hoping to find that part of my mind 
 That's mostly confine and blind 
 Yes pure and refined 
 Untampered with time 
 Subliminal sublime 
 The criminal's crime 
 I reach and climb 
 I keep it refined I speak and I grind 
 Away 
 Keep watching your back and cover your tracks 
 Get up on the facts and relax 
 And as the dust settles another one bites 
 He fights but he lost his life device 
 He's iced my advice 
 Don't play unless you plan to pay the price 
 We all hurt sometimes. don't we? 
 We all get hurt sometimes. don't we? 
 We all laugh sometimes. don't we? 
 We often pass the time. don't we? 
 We all get mad sometimes. don't we? 
 We all can flash at times. can't we? 
 Have some piece of mind? 
 Don't we need to seize the time? don't we? 
 Life is fucked up 
 But it can be 
 Some people just lucked up 
 Because they can see 
 The shit is chaotic in disguise 
 Guns and narcotics for or demise 
 And don't forget the lies 
 They pump you with 
 I rise to the occasion without a scratch or abrasion 
 Just a hop, skip, and jump 
 Away from a rock hit and a drunk 
 No loitering here 
 Aye y'all can't hang out after dark here 
 Excuse me sir but you can't park here! 
 I mean tell your dogs that they can't bark here 
 I mean the world is moving baby 
 But you gotta just hold on 
 But sometimes you can't just hold on 
 You gotta just let it go 
 Let, let, let, let, let it go
