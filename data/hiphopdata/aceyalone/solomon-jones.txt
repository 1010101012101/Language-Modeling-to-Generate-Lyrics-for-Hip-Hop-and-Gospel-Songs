A bunch of wild boys was hanging around 
 At the local neighborhood saloon 
 And some cat kept dropping quarters down in the jukebox 
 Playing all the favorite tunes 
 And back by the bar playing cards looking hard 
 Was big bad Solomon Jones 
 And watching over his luck 
 Was the love of his life 
 Is the lady that was known as Simone 
 When out of the night which was dark and cold 
 Into the smoke-filled dimly-lit room 
 Stumbled in a thug 
 Who was smelling like bud 
 And his eyes looked high as the moon 
 He looked like a man with his foot in the grave 
 And his lifetime about to be out 
 Yet he slapped down some hundred-dollar bills on the bar 
 And he yelled out "drinks on the house" 
 Now nobody could place where this dude was from 
 But we knew that he was far from home 
 But we drank to his health 
 And the last to drink was big bad Solomon Jones 
 Now there are some G's 
 Who just run the streets 
 And they live life in and out of jail 
 And such was he, that kind of OG 
 That looked like he'd been through hell 
 With his hair in cornrows 
 A mean mug grill 
 Like a dog who's day is done 
 He lit up the green stuff in his cigar 
 And took hits one by one 
 Now I got to thinking who this cat could be 
 And what the hell is- going on 
 Well I turned around and who was staring at him 
 The lady that was known as Simone 
 And the white t-shirt all stained with dirt 
 He was trying not to be rude 
 But he was trying to find another 
 Good song on the jukebox 
 So he could just set the mood 
 Have you ever been out in the city streets 
 With the gang-made players so clear 
 Where the police and gangsters control the block 
 And gunshots is all that you hear 
 When the only sounds are the drums of war 
 And you left out in the cold 
 A half-dead man in a half-dead world 
 And a yellow-brick road to go 
 Then all of a sudden the music changed 
 And everyone just held their post â¨But it felt like a life had been robbed from you 
 And everything that you held close 
 ¨That someone has stolen the women you love 
 And that her love was a devil's lie â¨That your heart was gone and the best thing that you could do is crawl away and die â¨It's the painful cry of a man's despair deep down in his bones â¨I guess misery enjoys company, said big bad Solomon Jones 
 And the stranger turned 
 And his eyes had burned 
 In a most peculiar way 
 And the white t-shirt that was stained in dirt 
 He sat in to watch me sway 
 Then his mouth had frowned up in this kind of grin 
 And he spoke in a voice so clear 
 "Boys you don't know who I am 
 And I know that you just don't care" 
 "Now I'ma say these words 
 Cause these words are true 
 And when I'm done here I'll be gone 
 But one of you boys is a shiesty dog 
 And his name is Solomon Jones" 
 Then I ducked my head 
 And the lights went out 
 And two guns blazed in the dark 
 Then I women swooned 
 And the lights came on 
 And the two men laced with the starch. 
 With a bullet in his head 
 And pumped full of lead 
 Was big bad Solomon Jones 
 What a thug from the street 
 Who was hoeing his heat 
 And who knows to that lady named Simone
