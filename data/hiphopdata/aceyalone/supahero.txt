Supahero 
 Baby I'm your star, but you looking for a super hero 
 And superman don't fly no more, 'cause he ain't one with the people 
 And baby I'm your star, but you looking for a super hero 
 And he ain't there, he ain't nowhere to be found when he should be fightning evil 
 I want to love, cause that's my duty. it's not your booty or it's not your beauty 
 Your not just a cutie, you make me whole. It's not the movies where they fake the role 
 I try to take control, for the sake of soul. But the only thing I need to do is scrape the bowl 
 When god made me, he said break the mold. I put foot to the concrete and shake the road 
 I don't have powers like a caped crusader, but I do got powers like an ace invader 
 Back in the days he had so much flavor, he was so major to get you on the danger 
 Now you can't find him and he's just a stranger, and if you did he would probably give you the finger 
 You hit channel zero on your channel changer, and you hear it with a life savor threw you an anchor 
 Baby I'm your star, but you looking for a super hero 
 And superman don't' fly no more, 'cause he ain't one with the people 
 Baby I'm your star, but you looking for a super hero 
 And he ain't there, he ain't nowhere to be found when he should be fightning evil 
 Yeah baby love, it maybe love. A joke or a fairy tale one of the above. 
 I really don't know what you thinking of, I can't make it away from underneath my glove. 
 I can't see through walls, but I can see through you. You dress up the dog, but that's all you do 
 You fell for him, he didn't fall for you. Its just me that's all I've got to offer you 
 I don't save the day, I just pave the way. In the city of gotham another days a day. 
 I know it pays to play, but I ain't playing. I ain't laying my coat down, know what I'm saying? 
 You want lots of muscles and lots of green, For my hustle and busltle is my only thing 
 And then it all passed, my last all seen. You need to start your life not in your dreams. 
 Baby I'm your star, but you looking for a super hero 
 And superman don't' fly no more, 'cause he ain't one with the people 
 Baby I'm your star, but you looking for a super hero 
 And he ain't there, he ain't nowhere to be found when he should be fightning evil
