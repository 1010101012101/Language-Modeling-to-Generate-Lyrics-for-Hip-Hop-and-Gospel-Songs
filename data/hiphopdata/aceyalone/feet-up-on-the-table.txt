Hey dude, you want me to start like four bars up in this shit 
 (Yeah nigga, what you got dick on your mind or something?) 
 Aw nigga, fuck you 
 Hey pussy, listen, you're hearing aid'll be his ass whipping 
 Pussy, you're rhyme keeps on slipping 
 Go home and gets to trippin' 
 Pussy, I slow your row with that tampon 
 Your flow be misthrown 
 Come up out that couch and plant my flag in your neighborhood 
 You got cable, I'm leaving toenail clippings on your table 
 Now I break lots of crews up 
 Who cruise up like they got big nuts 
 What I dig up gets 
 Big ups and also blow some wigs up 
 Get up for the beat down 
 I'm taking your seat now 
 Relaxing my feet up on the coffee table 
 While I floss me labels fool 
 I got what the fuck you need and more 
 I'll kick in your door, dammit then slam it behind me 
 You'll find me in the bedroom where your kids is at 
 I tell 'em that their daddy's gonna die 
 Then give 'em smacks and get some stacks 
 And hit the sofa with a loaf 
 Of bread and some chicken backs 
 Feet up on the table and your woman in my lap 
 Blast off, lift off, wanna twist off the cap 
 The love of my life is the rap 
 The love of your life in my lap 
 Leap if you're feeling lucky 
 My speech [unverified] Kermit 
 You're walking that style with no leash 
 Do you have a permit? 
 Cut it out like some scissors 
 Get rollin' like Twizzlers sweets 
 Drivin' a big blue up the streets 
 Bumpin' helluva beats through your weak butt 
 Me, I gotta maintain my rep, wake up you slept 
 Lucky to get slapped, I should have just broke your neck 
 Got juice like in a dream, blow up like gasoline when it's lit 
 You battle him and you battle them but I really don't give a shit
