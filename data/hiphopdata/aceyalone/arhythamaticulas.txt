 Well up until now your only concept of rhythm is a four by four loop 
 Square as a pool table 
 With no dynamics implanted but you couldn't understand 
 There were all of your gigantic rap sounded so bland 
 But the answer was right in your hand 
 Couldn't believe you were so naive to 
 Arrangements changes different time signatures 
 The figment of your imagination that must have been a fixation with blocks 
 Like tryin' to make a wheel out of rock 
 Like tryin' to make a puppet out of sock 
 See I got that private stock the personal vat with the broth and gravy 
 And the electrons to pass on so the world don't seem so wavy 
 Oh everybody hollerin' save me, save yourself before it's too late into the 
 When you go because my wig got weight I gotta concentrate on

 This rhythm is sick, this rhythm's ridiculous 
 Arhythamatic arhythamaticulas 
 This rhythm is sick, this rhythm is outta control 
 Yeah now everybody in here check your head and make sure that it's spacious 
 And open up the middle just a millimeter more for the style that is bodacious 
 You really wanna know who the ace is 
 Ace is the face that's seldom sighted 
 I'm divided into two parts I got two hearts 
 Two heads I'm a head ahead one of the better bred 
 Know you're thinkin' I'm gonna be I got the remedy to turn you out 
 I got the fiery styles that'll burn you out if you don't learn that route 
 Now I been there done that did it committed to run that 
 Talk to it do it right 
 Me and this mic gonna take flight to end your mental plight 
 Hip hop is more than the "yes y'all" 
 Throw your hands in the air say ho (Ho!) 
 And give up the w 'cause I'm from the west y'all (West Coast) 
 And you know I got mad phat flow 
 Coming in the house through the back door out the front door 
 Cross the frontyard into the street 
 We could do it right here better yet I got a better idea 
 I'm a get you up off your feet with that

 Now the problem with you MC's today is you're too emotional 
 You have no devotion to the social bug spread 
 By the words you said to the public 
 You have no regard for the masses, how you effect them 
 And how they view you 
 Now you know you knew you were open wide for the 
 Whole wide world to do you 
 Now I propose those who chose their flows 
 Irresponsible and irrationally 
 Be exhausted from the face of the earth and be forced to deal with me 
 Me I'd rather be undefined not underestimated or undermined 
 I'm underlined as the underdog under the influence of time 
 Now I know you sick of that same old same old 
 Lame old running man dance style 
 Niggas screamin' and yellin' and tellin' lies about what they do 
 Brother I say to you but don't you believe or be deceived 
 By the hip hop that you breath 
 I am multi-directional I move randomly and professional 
 Intellectual with perpetual 
 Thrustin' motion bustin' you open 
 Now you are exposed to the rap and closed in the mind trap; I find that 
 Hilarious and mysterious; every area gets a dose 
 Full of malaria and asbestos from the west coast 
 Breathe in and coat your lungs
