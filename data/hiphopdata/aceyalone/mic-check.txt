If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A one two, a check a one two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A check two, a mic a check two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A one two, a check a one two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A one two, and I'm a check you 
 I start most of my raps off kinda slow 
 Just so you could see exactly where it gonna go 
 I make sure your body's strapped in 
 'Cause I'ma tailspin and you're liable to get thrown 
 The Bible is the microphone; I read from the scripture 
 Leave it up to you to see the pictures 
 I hover above MC's like a flying saucer 
 With the sorcery to alter the future 
 Present and the past, don't be hesitant to ask 
 Me to be the man I'll be the last 
 I'll be movin fast on that ass, I stipulate your fate 
 I take a grip I'll take a shot I'll break your plates 
 Now can you take the weight or do I have to make it lighter tighter 
 Than you could imagine that I had to been when I recite a rhyme 
 I might as well be inside of your mind 
 I know you thinkin', "damn! how does he? what was he a man 
 Or a machine with computerized diagrams? " 
 I tell em, "nope! I am of the flesh, fresh, dope" 
 I'm set apart you're just a shot in the dark 
 And the darkness casts no shadow 
 And I'll be victorious, no matter who I battle 
 So every rapper in the house shut the fuck up! 
 'Cause if it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 - Check one, check two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all 
 - Check a one two check a one two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A check one check two now I check you 
 Now everyone knows I got the milk like d, homemade quilt 
 To get your wig peelt, like it should be 
 Top o' the mornin to ya, it's so many ways to do ya 
 I offer you the shield, just before I deal on ya 
 I recommend, that when I squeeze the puss from your skin 
 You pretend it ain't happenin' 
 Cause everywhere is my stompin grounds 
 When MC's stepped in I stomp 'em down to the lowest 
 You the slowest rapper that I met, but you owe us all a favor 
 Not to, jet (nah you ain't goin' nowhere) 
 Not until you show us you be flippin 
 I give your body lashes and whippins 
 T crashes the board like pippen, I has to be trippin' 
 Not for your pleasure or your entertainment I came with 
 A crew called self, and everybody looked just like me 
 And we agreed that we dope fool 
 We got flavor and everyone knows who's the saviour 
 Cause everyone knows, everyone knows 
 Everyone knows I got flow 
 And if it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A one two, a check a one two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A check two, a mic a check two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A one two, a check a one two 
 If it wasn't for a mic check you wouldn't have a check at all 
 - A one two, and I'ma check you 
 See the mic check brings all the chaos to order 
 I conquer the perimeter sealing the borders 
 To catch the feeble child weeble wobble style evil subject 
 Too deadly ready to wreck, anyone in my way 
 I am what is know as the expandable specimen 
 Not understandable when I handle my mic check 
 I enlarge to full capcacity drasticallly fast 
 It has to be my well manicured dastardly pure blast 
 Will sniffle and lift, level and shift, earthplates 
 Speeded up birthrate repetitive let it live then let it die 
 Right inside the eye of the negative 
 I love puttin' pressure on the lesser competitive 
 Inferior you're determined, vermin, sherman stick smoked 
 I got the elephantitus styles superior stroke 
 Of genius, I spoke and hell broke loose 
 I saturated the streets, 'fatuated by drum beats 
 My heat, so-lar, warms the po-lar 
 Melting glaciers, I are shooting star chaser 
 The laser beam on my hip swings when I rip 
 Fully loaded electricity clips I can't miss 
 Stimulating your body fluids to flow as well as I do 
 I do what is necessary to counter the blockage 
 I can just rocket/rock-it with no fuel, dual exhaust 
 Is costing your life renewal 
 I bring about a change meanin' I'm about as strange as they come 
 I come from the depths and wish they slept none son 
 I am I was I be because I'm me 
 Originality for your fatality 
 Now I am a traveler word scambler 
 Not a scribbler or a scavenger, eatin the place 
 You're greedy and feedin your face, 'cause you're needin a taste 
 Of this niceness, but my advice is don't imitate 
 My likeness, oh I'ma fella who knows what the 
 Mic is, and I do it somethin' like this 
 Freestyle fellowship aceyalone mikah 9 Jupiter peace 
 Chillin' villain empire afterlife hip hop clan mass men the nonce 
 Abrude western hemisphere meen green boomin james born 
 Allah first... 
 And if if wasn't for a mic check I wouldn't have a check at all 
 - Check one check two now I'm through with you 
 And all the heavyweight crew puttin' it down, ten cent eve 
 Doin' it at project bliznah-iznow, fool!
