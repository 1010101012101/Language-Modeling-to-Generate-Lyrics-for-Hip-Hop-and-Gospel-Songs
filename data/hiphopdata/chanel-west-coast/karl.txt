It's your girl Chanel West Coast 
 If you drunk and acting foolish then this be the music 
 That shit to make you lose it, get thrown out like you stupid 
 Maybe bands'll make her do it, lands in France will make me move it 
 In a trance from my movement, getting love like Jen Hewitt 
 Living life to the fullest like Jack Nick and Freeman in that movie 
 Catch me living in Miami, Willy beeming with the Louis 
 The queen, of Lamb beans, stay dripped in balla jewelry 
 No other team, we live the dream, that's just the way we do it B 
 I'm about what's happening, stay all about my fashion 
 Chicks that we be smashing, getting money that's my passion 
 Loaded like I'm blazing, you can't get it, why you asking 
 Got money in my mansion, flashing lights Kardashian 
 Looking, looking so fly, I'm tied with the sky 
 Looking, looking so fly, I'm tied with the sky 
 Looking, looking so fly, I'm tied with the sky 
 Looking, looking so fly, I'm tied with the sky 
 Karl Lagerfeld, Karl Lagerfeld 
 Karl Lagerfeld, Karl Lagerfeld 
 Karl Lagerfeld, Karl Lagerfeld 
 You know I'm looking so fly 
 Lamborgini doors to my front porch 'cause I just lost my mind 
 San Borgini tours, burnt cash like torch 'cause I stay on my grind 
 In bikinis, hot so hot scorch, beach bunny is the line 
 Sip martinis, coast to coast, be at the chatxeoux all the time 
 Jimi choos baby, that's my shoes baby 
 I'll never lose baby, spread the news baby 
 I'm the deuce baby, on top of booths baby 
 My swag a million, billion, a trillion, Chanel be the truth baby 
 I'm about what's happening, stay all about my fashion 
 Chicks that we be smashing, getting money that's my passion 
 Loaded like I'm blazing, you can't get it, why you asking 
 Got money in my mansion, flashing lights Kardashian 
 Looking, looking so fly, I'm tied with the sky 
 Looking, looking so fly, I'm tied with the sky 
 Looking, looking so fly, I'm tied with the sky 
 Looking, looking so fly, I'm tied with the sky 
 Karl Lagerfeld, Karl Lagerfeld 
 Karl Lagerfeld, Karl Lagerfeld 
 You know I'm looking so fly 
 Karl Lagerfeld, Karl Lagerfeld 
 Karl Lagerfeld, Karl Lagerfeld 
 You know I'm looking so fly 
 New York, Paris, London, Japan 
 All around the world, keep getting what you can 
 And I won't stop forever, cop the flyest, get the largest 
 Ride a poly to Vancouver 'cause I'm hotter than some tater tots 
 I'm never gonna be too Hollywood so you can never say it 
 I paid my dues in Hollywood, my road I even paid it 
 And now I'm on the red carpet in red bottoms, that's what they said 
 I'm living the dream, make my own bread, drink the kill leaving them dead 
 I'm about what's happening, stay all about my fashion 
 Chicks that we be smashing, getting money that's my passion 
 Loaded like I'm blazing, you can't get it, why you asking 
 Got money in my mansion, flashing lights Kardashian 
 Looking, looking so fly, I'm tied with the sky 
 Looking, looking so fly, I'm tied with the sky 
 Looking, looking so fly, I'm tied with the sky 
 Looking, looking so fly, I'm tied with the sky

 You know I'm looking so fly

 Karl Lagerfeld, Karl Lagerfeld 
 You know I'm looking so fly
