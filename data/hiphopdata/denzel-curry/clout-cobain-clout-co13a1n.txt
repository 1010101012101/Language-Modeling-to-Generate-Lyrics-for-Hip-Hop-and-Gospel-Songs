I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself 
 Man I been on my own, Lord, I might need some help 
 I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself 
 Man, it's been so damn long, dealing with the things I've felt 
 Suicidal thoughts, call it Kurt Cobain 
 Suwu leather seats, like a bloody stain 
 I need hella bass, I need hella pain 
 You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain 
 Suicidal thoughts, call it Kurt Cobain 
 Suwu leather seats, like a bloody stain 
 I need hella bass, I need hella pain 
 You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain 
 I don't even know what to feel 
 They don't even know what's real 
 Dry tears with a dollar bill, I'm out tryna make a mill', oh 
 Why you wanna take my soul? I'm yelling out "hell no!" 
 I can't even trust my friends, most of them might be foes 
 Watch these hoes when they say they wanna lie to me 
 I don't know who's the one that wanna plot on me 
 I stay low so my demons don't acknowledge me 
 When I go, I know death don't do apologies 
 I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself 
 Better been on my own, Lord, I might need some help 
 I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself 
 Man, it's been so damn long, dealing with the things I felt 
 Suicidal thoughts, call it Kurt Cobain 
 Suwu leather seats, like a bloody stain 
 I need hella bass, I need hella pain 
 You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain 
 Suicidal thoughts, call it Kurt Cobain 
 Suwu leather seats, like a bloody stain 
 I need hella bass, I need hella pain 
 You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain 
 Know when it rains, it pours 
 They wanna go to war for things that they can't afford 
 I gotta grab the sword, preach 
 I gotta thank the lord, I gotta go record (heat) 
 I wanna be fly to soar 'cause niggas be trying' to floor me 
 People be thinkin' that I won the lottery 
 So paranoid, I don't know who be plotting on me 
 I don't know what trapped the virtue 
 I'm feeling like Raichu 'cause everything shocking to me 
 Gotta be aware of the wicked, the time will be ticking 
 Them niggas still clocking on me 
 Lord is my witness, I handle my business 
 You niggas ain't never ball blocking on me 
 I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself 
 Better been on my own, Lord, I might need some help 
 I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself 
 Man, it's been so damn long, dealing with the things I've felt 
 Suicidal thoughts, call it Kurt Cobain 
 Suwu leather seats, like a bloody stain 
 I need hella bass, I need hella pain 
 You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain 
 Suicidal thoughts, call it Kurt Cobain 
 Suwu leather seats, like a bloody stain 
 I need hella bass, I need hella pain 
 You gon' wanna cry, I'ma make it rain
