Why these crackers thinking that a nigga sell narcotics? 
 Just because I'm living doesn't mean a nigga got it 
 Aye, smoking and twisting I'm black and I'm gifted 
 These crackers be thinking that niggas get wicked 
 Ferocious and vicious they bust out and diss us 
 Imperial piss then (?) 
 That's another nigga dead, hit 'em with beam infrared 
 Frankly I'm fed up with Feds 
 Profiling because my dreads, long 
 Nigga that's Biggie, that's dead wrong 
 Head home, (?) in the atmosphere wondering why a nigga is selling narcotics 
 All because we niggas that be living in the projects 
 If I move for the nigga even with the object 
 Objective is subject watch kill 
 Take you down if they know you got it 
 Brains in the street they'll leave you thoughtless 
 Damn 
 Why these crackers thinking that a nigga sell narcotics? 
 Just because I'm living doesn't mean a nigga got it King of the mischievous, South 
 Speaking with my deviant, mouth 
 How do I feel since I'm black, proud? 
 What's the shit you represent? Cloud 
 Nine on the side of my hip, bow 
 This is the return of the black, owl 
 (?) Bring the mac, out 
 Raven Miyagi is back, ow 
 Black metal fist got these motherfuckers caught up in the mix 
 Put 'em in the bars when they didn't do shit 
 Got the opposition living on the offense 
 Why I gotta grab my rifle? 
 Think about survival hand on the Bible, so 
 I won't let none of them take my soul 
 That's why a nigga stay on ten toes, damn
