That nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up 
 That nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up 
 That nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up 
 I'ma get money by any means, run it up 
 Uh huh, to be or not to be? 
 Hamlet, I'm lit 
 If it ain't homicide, I don't commit 
 Y'all throw a fit when you don't got a fit 
 If you put out a hit 
 Bet you the killer ain't gon' make a cent 
 Bitch, it's a Miami nigga no Moonlight 
 Let's take it back to the crib 
 One of my homies, he pull the gun on me 
 He turnin' cold on me like meet the maker 
 So super phony as if he don't know me 
 I see what they told me about the hater 
 And I wasn't even phased, been the hottest in the place 
 Talkin' 'bout a nigga changed with a pocket full of change 
 Range, this order, blame this for the pain in Florida 
 Bipolar, vibe over, time slower I'm sober, now sorta see 
 What is going on with me? (huh) 
 Gotta shout-out *censored* G 
 You did wrong, but it's done for the right 
 New friends, new flies they swarm to the light 
 Money and a new girl that's warm for the night 
 Do a hoe like clothes they worn for the night like 
 That nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up 
 That nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up 
 That nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up 
 I'ma get money by any means, run it up 
 Uh huh, how can I see through my lenses 
 When I can't see who my friend is, huh? 
 Wanna be down as dependent 
 Would you give up your appendix? 
 If life is hangin' by a thread 
 Then a nigga just might be dead 
 If my life was in your hands 
 Now a nigga don't trust no man 
 Maybe I shoulda been shot on the day that it happened 
 When you started snappin' on me 
 They only seen what's on the one side 
 It's deeper than rap nigga and a nigga move back to the 3 
 Get back to it with the boys in my hood 
 'Cause it ain't about no other 
 I got new niggas tellin' these new niggas 
 That I don't fuck with my brother 
 They only know Denzel Curry 
 But they really don't know Denzel 
 Everybody wanna ride waves 
 And jump when the ship don't sail 
 You did wrong, not done for the right 
 New friends, new flies, you flew to the life 
 Funny what these new niggas might do for the hype 
 Lesson learned, I'm goin' on through with ya life like 
 That nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up 
 That nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up 
 That nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up 
 I'ma get money by any means, run it up 
 That nigga nice, that nigga mean, switch it up 
 That nigga raw, that nigga green, switch it up 
 That nigga lost, he in the lead, switch it up 
 I'ma get money by any means, run it up
