Marching to nostalgic rock shit, I'm Brock, bitch 
 Semi automatic, might blast like team rocket 
 Wait until I mention I slay you with that Tupac shit 
 One golden bullet that kill all that faggot pop shit 
 Delivery, I'm the bullet that killed Kennedy 
 Enemy, DITC, darkest symphony 
 Neck broke, fuck around and let the tech blow 
 Red beam to us is not gonna make it look like techno 
 I told you, I don't even wanna be the best, hoe 
 I'm the threat with Tourette, making motherfuckers John Doe 
 Ricky Rozay, bury his killer, 
 Making a family cry together like the old Js 
 Back in the old days I'm the one that's chosen 
 Thug from the 90s, I'm cryogenically frozen, avenger 
 Yeah, I be the Joker and the Riddler 
 With a mind set that's switched like Harvey Dents den 
 The Dark Knight, fucking Clark Kent 
 Martin Lawrence when he traveled back in time would suspend 
 Suspended animation when my brain reacts 
 Don't belong in this world like I'm Samurai Jack 
 Click clack on a Glock 17, get mean 
 Then put the ghost face so we can empty the cream 
 Cash rules everything around me, surrounded the ditch 
 Where they dug the darkness that's shrouding 
 You found me, Nemo, ego come easy 
 Bro, I'm from a city where niggas they con easy 
 Where they quick to pull that trigger, never a squeegee 
 They make it on the late night news, nigga, good evening 
 Marching to nostalgic rock shit, I'm Brock, bitch 
 Semi automatic, might blast like team rocket 
 Wait until I mention I slay you with that Tupac shit 
 One golden bullet that kill all that faggot pop shit 
 Marching to nostalgic rock shit, I'm Brock, bitch 
 Semi automatic, might blast like team rocket 
 Wait until I mention I slay you with that Tupac shit 
 One golden bullet that kill all that faggot pop shit 
 I'm massive, fornicating with crack shit 
 Cheated with the virus that took over the life of Magic 
 Sharing a needle with a common/hobo 
 Sterilize with the spit that comes from a Komodo dragon 
 Gun shot, fire, I'm blasting, go and sip that shit, its just a classic 
 That's a hit for you, bastards, that's the shit for you, bastards 
 I'm lugubrious because I'm from a place where niggas shoot at shit 
 And never on no Buddha shit, that knock knock, then who is it? 
 Am I really losing it? Maybe, trapped in a white room with a dead baby 
 Am I growing crazy? Is my name Casey? Anthony, then that baby turns into an amputee 
 Goddamn, I'm really losing my mind 
 Or should I end it all just like grabbing a nine? 
 But it's too easy, figures on my mind eat me 
 Put me into isolation so you wouldn't see me 
 Free me from misery, I'm uneasy 
 Pain, emotion from the grip I gained 
 Yet another young brain slain, maintain 
 You just lost consciousness, that's life when you live without consequence 
 Death over sixteen shots, his head is split, dead
