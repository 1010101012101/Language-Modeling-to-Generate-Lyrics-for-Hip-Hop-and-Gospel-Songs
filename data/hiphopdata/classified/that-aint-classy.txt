You want it you need it I got it cause this is how its goin' down you want you need it I got it 
 They call me mr. negativity call it how I see yes I'm back in the vicinity 
 Bringing what you need plus all of the amenities 
 Not what you consider thee running the mill running the drill none of it's real celebrity 
 I don't let any of it get to me I am more mystery mentally and physically 
 Yeah I've seen the bright lights ever so vividly 
 Party with the star types and mingle with the industry 
 But geez we don't need another hero I relate to real people not these self centered weirdo's 
 Flamboyant wannabe o so flashy if you ask me that really isn't classy 
 You'll never see me with my sunglasses on in the club dancing on the tables to my own song getting buzzed 
 And you never see me with a couple bottles of Chris trying to pick up on a chick 
 Like bitch you want this? That ain't classy 
 The radio's playing my song, I got a record label that's putting me on 
 But I still stay classy still stay classy still stay classy I'ma do what I gotta do and... 
 If you're not relatin its hard not to hate them don't care what they're saying I ain't changing 
 That ain't classy that ain't classy that ain't classy that ain't classy 
 Oh hey yo my daily insecurities got me locked down like I'm sitting in security 
 Getting locked down and it never did occurred to me it presented perfectly verbally 
 My certainties could turn into my currencies but you'll never see my shirt wide open 
 With the chest hair blowing in the wind I know it 
 You never see me loose it trying to justify my music 
 At award shows 'cause I didn't win I know it 
 I'm adamant I won't become extravagant 'cause you're my management 
 And the guys I travel with they havin' it 
 I'm just an average man who happen to have a plan 
 Never had to front on who I am to attract a fan 
 And don't be mad 'cause I never pop bottles 
 I don't waste for money I save my money return and pop bottles 
 Don't hate wait I ain't trying to say I'm trying to get paid 
 I'm trying to work earn the money I make that's classy 
 The radio's playing my song and I got a record label that's putting me on 
 But I still stay classy still stay classy still stay classy I'ma do what I gotta do...And 
 If you're not relatin its hard not to hate them don't care what they're saying I ain't changing 
 That ain't classy that ain't classy that ain't classy that ain't classy 
 You want it you need it I got it you want you need it I got it, cause this is how it's going down, you want it you need it I got it 
 Yeah now I'm the one making many beats pumping in the trunk 
 I'm the one smoking many trees pumpin in the club 
 I'm the one getting loose Friday night having fun 
 Spilling drinks on the wifey when I'm a little drunk 
 That's classy I guess I'm the ultimatum as y'all aware I'm often hated 'cause they're not relating 
 And I don't feel offended everyone can say their piece 
 I just really hate pretending so all you get is me that's classy 
 The radio's playing my song and I got a record label that's putting me on 
 But I still stay classy still stay classy still stay classy I'ma do what I gotta do... 
 If you're relating its hard not to hate them don't care what they're saying I ain't changing 
 That ain't classy that ain't classy that ain't classy that ain't classy 
 You want it you need it I got it 
 You want you need it I got it
