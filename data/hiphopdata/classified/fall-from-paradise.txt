I know that everything that goes up, must come down 
 That everybody with luck, must run out 
 Ya, so now I'm contemplating, like 'what's up now' 
 The music thing is all gone, but I'll suck it up proud 
 I did more than I imagined, tours I couldn't fathom 
 Broke down doors for sure, I let 'em have it 
 If any opportunity came, I had to grab it 
 Any goals set, I rose, then ran past it 
 Not a superstar and never wanted that 
 But I did sign some autographs on some groupies' ass 
 Smoked a lot of free weed from St. John's to BC 
 They came out the wood work, to see me speak 
 That was paradise 
 I went through all types of bullshit, the story go way back 
 And I'm proud of myself now, though its corny to say that 
 Hip hop in Enfield was really non existence 
 Parents thought I was a fad, Dad I gone the distance 
 I tried to make a difference, I kept workin off persistence 
 No one paid attention, now I talk and they listen 
 Emcees are often dissin, like I'm the man to beat 
 Ya I met a lot of rap stars that still a fan of me 
 I rock shows wit Busta, had songs in his movie 
 A chicken wit Luda, conversated wit some doobie 
 I drank wit Buck Shot, and DJ Evil D 
 I did songs wit Maestro, and smoked hash wit Keith Moby 
 I love hip hop, cause it made me who I am 
 It gave me confidence, and it made a honest man 
 This is paradise, and I found a promise land 
 So now I'm chillin' and enjoyin my accomplishments 
 It's paradise 
 Now a couple years after this drop, I'll probably flop 
 But that's the way it goes when you get on the top 
 I'm talkin' bout Canada, yo this industry's a joke 
 I'm a Canadian rap star, and kid I'm still broke 
 But I ain't work in years, and some think I'm famous 
 While other people ask when the hell I'm gunna make it 
 I'm good where I'm at, keep the glamour and the glitz 
 I don't run from my fans, cause my stamina is shit 
 I appreciate the heads, the critics, and the haters 
 I know I miss the ref, the bitches and the breakers 
 The tours, the shows, promoters and the assholes 
 The beats and the rhymes, cause that's all that Class knows 
 That was paradise 
 (Chorus: to fade)
