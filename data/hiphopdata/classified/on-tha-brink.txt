I'm a very bad daddy I am I am 
 I'm a nasty piece of work 
 I'm a terrible villain I am I am 
 In deep dark places I lurk 
 I'm a very bad daddy I am I am 
 I'm a nasty piece of work 
 I'm a terrible villain I am I am 
 In deep dark places I lurk 
 I'm a very bad daddy I am I am 
 I'm a nasty piece of work 
 I'm a terrible villain I am I am 
 In deep dark places I lurk 
 Mr. nice guy, it's time to fight fire with fire 
 Light up the night sky, fallin' on my right mind 
 My attitude don't get the job done 
 Instead of shoppin' demo's to these record labels I shoulda robbed them 
 And fuck tryin' ta meet the president or so and so 
 I stand toe to toe and throw down blow for blow 
 Y'all people don't take me serious on wax 
 'Cause I'm doin' this from Canada, the east coast at that 
 So I reach out and smash all y'all disrespectin' 
 Buy myself a weapon and shoot till y'all learn a lesson 
 Everybody talks about it, how hard is it? 
 It's like everyone's a thug maybe I want apart of it 
 Could you imagine this, class with a whodi wrist 
 Tight grip with the heat packed beside my hip 
 Oh shit, it's just the start of it 
 There's a lot of money in this world where's my part of it 
 'Cause I won't stop until you give me my respect 
 Stab you in the neck and fill your body with the check 
 I'm kidnappin' your mom, fuck I'll knock your whole crew 
 And these are just a few things that I could do to you 
 But I've grown up, so I don't talk all that shit 
 But maybe I woulda blown up if I fronted like I did 
 Would of gotten that extra grant to shoot another video 
 But they give it to the same ol' kid with the same ol' shitty flow 
 (Oh) I can't believe this 
 I'm tryin' to keep myself positive but it's hard when I see this 
 And that's some real weak shit you build to my struggles 
 Someday I might snap and cause you a little trouble 
 I'm a very bad daddy I am I am 
 I'm a nasty piece of work 
 I'm a terrible villain I am I am 
 In deep dark places I lurk 
 I'm a very bad daddy I am I am 
 I'm a nasty piece of work 
 I'm a terrible villain I am I am 
 In deep dark places I lurk
