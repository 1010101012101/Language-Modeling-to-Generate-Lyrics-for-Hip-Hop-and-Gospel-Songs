Yo, let's take it back to the Maritimes Man 
 You can't take yourself too serious 
 Do that thing you guys were doing 
 Fill your cup up and chug 
 Roll a joint up and get fucked 
 Ready for a kitchen party 
 Welcome to the Maritimes [x2] 
 I'm from the East Coast of Canada, home of the bag pipe 
 Known for the fiddle players, beer and our keg price 
 Known for Alexander Keiths and the Donair 
 Home of the Mooseheads, but I don't really go there 
 We pay a buck for a litre of gas and 
 Smokes cost $10 a pack and 
 We always mix our tobacco with weed, its' just the way 
 We always done it, shit is natural to me 
 So let me tackle the beat and unravel the scene 
 Let you people know what you never travel to see 
 We got battle MC's, we got storytellers 
 And we got awful MC's and corny motherfuckers 
 We got everything you wanna hear 
 Conscious to Backpack, Commercial to Gangsta 
 R&B to Abstract, grunge to Rock, Classical to Country 
 So many artist workin' but no one making money 
 Welcome to the East Coast, home of the innocence 
 Still Piegon Holed, as a farm or a fisher man 
 No major league teams, baseball or hockey 
 No urban radio, just country and pop beats 
 I'm trying to shake these stereotypes 
 So give me space please, let me air out my life 
 I don't even eat fish, shit I never tried lobster 
 Can't play the fiddle, and never was a logger 
 But I swam in clean lakes, yeah and enjoyed cool breezes 
 But Halifax Harbour's like swimming in diseases 
 We only known for Anne of Green Gables, 
 Coal mines, The Bluenose and P.E.I potatoes 
 The Maritimes, it's better then that 
 We livin' in the nether times so dead it with that 
 We got Universal Soul and Buck 65 and 
 The whole CTG and of course Classified 
 We got Back Burner, Good Night, Alpha Flight, Lock Down 
 Mic Boyd, First Word, Tro Biz, and Hell Town 
 And a million other artists, tryin' to get their flow heard 
 And let you know that we still workin' on these outskirts 
 We trying to blow like Halifax Explosion 
 Or maybe Anne Murray I know she's Nova Scotian 
 Or Hurricane Juan blowin' from the ocean 
 Either way it goes I'm still reppin' for my coast man 
 That's how we do it down here 
 Least that's how you think we do it down here 
 We all pile in the kitchen 
 Do it like this 
 Welcome to the Maritimes
