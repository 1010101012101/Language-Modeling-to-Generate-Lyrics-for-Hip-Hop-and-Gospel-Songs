(Mic Boyd) 
 All I can do is watch while friends move out west 
 Thinkin' to myself, wonderin' who goes next 
 Kinda makes me feel like everyday I lose a step 
 I feel trapped and I gotta chew through the net 
 Now life moves on, I ain't gettin' any younger 
 All my high school friends all marryin' their lovers 
 My ex got a baby and she's carryin' another 
 While I'm still livin' with my mother, whateva! 
 Well my ___ we separate, yeah we seen better days 
 Had some great times and the memories never fade 
 But now it's time to move on and get that new job 
 And be happy for the friends that found true love 
 But by losing some friends, I think I gained some 
 You see, I remember where I really came from 
 And that is the people that been there since day one 
 It's called family, can't no one replace them (thanks son!) 
 I guess I been missin' the me 
 It's like I been gone without ever leaving 
 And now I finally see it 
 Disappeared for what seemed like ten light years 
 Searchin' for love but the whole time it's been right here

 Yee, now I been told your friends are the family you choose 
 Your family you don't appreciate until you lose 
 'Scuse the attitude, I don't mean to kill the mood 
 But fuck it, I'm doin' Luke __ 
 Do what's real for you, been growin' up 
 You could say I live and learn 
 My friends show me love and I give it in return 
 A lot of things have changed though 
 Ever since I came home 
 Infield isn't all sunshine and rainbows 
 See after high school, I never woulda ...
