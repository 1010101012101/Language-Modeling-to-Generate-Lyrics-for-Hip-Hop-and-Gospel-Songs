Yeah 
 Listen 
 Emcees don't sleep, wake up check the schedule 
 Class on the mic, turn me up another decible 
 Some think I make money copein through a festival 
 Some think I'm dope, and they put me on a pedistal 
 Some say I'm cocky though, and tell me that my head is full 
 But I don't need 'em though, cause that's what real friends are for 
 And I don't know you man, sorry my attention's short 
 Shouldn't pay attention, to a stupid message board 
 I take it all for what it's worth, you can rest ashore 
 And I don't fall for stupid shit, like sex wit whores 
 I'm on the road to rock shows, and get paid 
 I play hard to get, so I'm hard to get played 
 I stay out the clubs, 'cause I don't need the static 
 It's hot enough in here, so I stay out of the attic 
 I don't rap wit rappers, so all y'all fuck off 
 You ain't scared of nothin', so drop all the tough talk 
 I got somethin' to say, so let me get into it 
 No time for wastin, I ain't tryin' to be a nuesence 
 No way, I'm tryin' to make a point so respect it 
 (I'm holdin' it down, and put it all in perspective) 
 Yeah 
 And when my tongue twist, I run this dumb shit 
 Hit hard like drum sticks, on drum kits, pump this 
 Play this in the streets, for the heads, or the club for the drunk chicks 
 (Yeah) beats bang, plus I spit till my gums split 
 You mighta knew me from the hey now song 
 And I dropped maritimes, another played out song 
 But the real heads know this, Class is the man 
 What these fake heads think, I'm a flash in the pan 
 (Listen) I was spittin' before you existed 
 Shit kid, I was enlisted before you showed interest 
 Before you knew how to use furry hoops, or had a clue of master beats, and the rubix cube too 
 I don't handle biz, when I'm smokin' my green 
 If you call when I'm high, then you get my machine 
 And any person know kid, it's just how I do it 
 So don't inturupt, when I'm tryna do my music 
 I got somethin' to say, so let me get into it 
 No time for wastin, I ain't tryin' to be a nuesence 
 No way, I'm tryin' to make a point so respect it 
 (I'm holdin' it down, and put it all in perspective x5) 
 (Whoo!) and I was raised by my parents, to speak wit manners 
 Growin' up fairytale, like believin in santa 
 Got excited over small things, like treats from grandma 
 Same thing now, except it's weed from the manager 
 Love mary jane, shit I think it's awsome 
 It's weird how pot heads like to brag about their problems 
 Now I got people tryin' to say I do coke 
 Well I never put a motherfuckin thing in my nose, okay 
 Do you, but it's not for me, fuck it's all I got, I keep my nostrils clean 
 You could quit with the cost of the talkin' and all that 
 Worry bout yourself, not me, now fall back 
 I got somethin' to say, so let me get into it 
 No time for wastin, I ain't tryin' to be a nuesence 
 No way, I'm tryin' to make a point so respect it 
 (I'm holdin' it down and put it all in perspective) 
 I got somethin' to say, so let me get into it 
 No time for wastin, I ain't tryin' to be a nuesence 
 No way, I'm tryin' to make a point so respect it 
 (I'm holdin' it down and put it all in perspective x5)
