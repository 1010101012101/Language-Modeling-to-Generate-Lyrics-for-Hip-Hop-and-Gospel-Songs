Things about to hit the fan 
 Hit the floor (classified) the record breaking (introducing) yo (the man 
 You the man's respect?) yo eh yo 
 Eh yo I straight spit on fake cliques 
 Make graces need braces 
 And hang 'em from their laces 
 I bring it back to basics 
 Keep you wide awake 
 When you continue talking shit 
 Like classified's a fake 
 Uh uh uh uh 
 I represent a plus you a minus 
 I bust on these tracks with these raps and one liners 
 Ten steps behind us 
 Five years to catch up 
 I'm a vet on the mic but give me one beer I'm messed up 
 Seeing double vision both eyes barely open 
 Deep thoughts 
 Arms crossed caught up for a brief moment 
 My beats potent 
 Spittin' words in a descrete motion 
 With free flowin literature to keep my people open 
 It shouldn't matter if your white or if your black 
 If your dope then your dope 
 If your wack then your wack 
 Breaking boards over backs 
 Of those who not trying 
 I'm knocking every internet MC ofline 
 Cover every angle 
 Checking every option 
 To many one-hit-wonders with they stock already dropping 
 I sit calm and watch them 
 Move when its right 
 Making moves in the night 
 I never lose on the mic ->chorus
