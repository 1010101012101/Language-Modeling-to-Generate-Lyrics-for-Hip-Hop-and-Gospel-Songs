Oh another one of those songs huh? 
 Beautiful day! 
 I smoke my weed, 
 I love my weed, 
 I eat my weed, 
 It's sickening! 
 I smoke my weed, 
 I love my weed, 
 I sleep with my weed, 
 It's sickening! 
 This is your, this is your song, 
 Yes I'm telling the world there's no living without you, 
 Don't be wrong, 
 'Cause I wake up every morning thinking about you, 
 Aiiyo Mike, yeah, 
 Remember back in the day, 
 We never smoked weed, 
 Never rapped in this way, 
 We had so much energy, 
 Ambition to play, 
 Yeah we was hitten the wits, 
 And tryin' to live each day, 
 To the fullest, 
 Weed was some bullshit to my peeps, 
 Till we stole it, 
 Locked in the Honda and rolled it, 
 We smoked out, 
 No doubt, 
 We got blazed, 
 Remember that, 
 I used your hat as the ashtray, 
 And that was the last day I'd ever be sober, 
 Consensing life as I knew it was over, 
 Yeah me too, 
 It's so much better now, 
 My vision is clear but my eyes seem redder now, 
 It's so great when I wake up 
 And puke up, 
 A pile, 
 Wipe my face with a towel, 
 It's Sickening, 
 Yo sometimes I smoke so much my eyes close shut, 
 I'm always hungry and I can't seem to eat enough, 
 Times its rough, 
 A partners life is tough, 
 But as soon as I'm waking up I'm in my room taking a puff, 
 Oh, good morning world 
 This is your, this is your song, 
 Yes I'm telling the world there's no living without you, 
 Don't be wrong, 
 'Cause I wake up every morning thinking about you, 
 I smoke my weed, 
 I love my weed, 
 I eat my weed, 
 It's sickening! 
 I smoke my weed, 
 I love my weed, 
 I sleep with my weed, 
 It's sickening! 
 Aiiyo now weed is not a bad thing, 
 It's a good thing, 
 A neighbourhood thing, 
 So much joy that it could bring, 
 Kinda like the time your girl taught you a lesson, 
 Dump chuck and you ended up on anti depressants, 
 Yeah man, 
 That was stressin, 
 Ended up in the mental clinic doc said I had to finish, 
 With the weed game and everything that's in it, 
 But I didn't so I'm livin' in this world, 
 Filled with misery, 
 Weed seems to get to me, 
 Better leave and let it be, 
 I can't believe that I ever put that shit in me, 
 Man that shits nothin' to me anymore, 
 Wassup, 
 You wanna smoked this joint, 
 Naw I can't stand that, 
 Yo one time I was in Curley's, 
 The old back pub, 
 We was smokin' in the bathroom till the bouncer broke it up, 
 Kicked me out for smokin' dope, 
 I'd stop, holy fuck, 
 It's just weed, 
 It's not like I'm throwin' up, 
 Oh well, 
 Now I'm in the parkin lot, 
 Waitin by myself, 
 Hear my name get called inside, 
 Go in a trip down south, 
 Thought to myself, 
 I gotta quit this weed, 
 But we all know glass would be blazed by three, 
 This is your, this is your song, 
 Yes I'm telling the world there's no living without you, 
 Don't be wrong, 
 'Cause I wake up every morning thinking about you, 
 I smoke my weed, 
 I love my weed, 
 I eat my weed, 
 It's sickening! 
 I smoke my weed, 
 I love my weed, 
 I sleep with my weed, 
 It's sickening! 
 This is your, this is your song, 
 Yes I'm telling the world there's no living without you, 
 Don't be wrong, 
 'Cause I wake up every morning thinking about you 
 It's sickening!
