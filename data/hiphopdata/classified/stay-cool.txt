Ah, damn it's hot in here... but ya know what? 
 I stay cool (yes I will) 
 I stay cool (oh yes I will) 
 Yeah 
 I stay cool 
 I need to unwind and loosen up 
 Lay back and chill out 
 'Cause I don't feel like doing much 
 I need to calm down, take a break 
 Kick back, relax, let the day just fade away 
 And yeah I guess it is the weekend 
 And my boy wants to club hop 
 But I can barely stay awake 
 I'm lampin, give me a hammock and a sandwich and I'm chillin' 
 Plus I don't play the dating game 
 Nah I'm staying home playing crazy eights 
 Maybe blaze a J 
 Play some old Jay-Z tapes (uh) 
 Or I can play a lil Babyface 
 Get my lady in the mood 
 And bang her with my babycakes 
 The world is running at a dangerous pace 
 To keep up we've got these red bulls and gatorades 
 I'm trying to slow down and walk this amazing race 
 Oh life is such a crazy place 
 But I stay cool (yes I will) 
 I stay cool (oh yes I will) 
 I stay cool 
 I stay cool 
 And when you're on your last nerve, stay cool 
 When the heat's on, chill 
 Under pressure, calm down, breathe to the beat 
 Stay cool under pressure 
 Chill when the heat's on 
 Calm down, breathe to the beat 
 Now can you hear the calmness of my voice 
 The coolness of my flow 
 The relaxed attitude 
 When I choose to let it go 
 Everybody's too excited 
 Worried, gettin' amped up 
 Feelin' like a prisoner 
 Handcuffed with their hands up (get 'em up) 
 Nah bring it down a bit 
 I like the energy 
 But in the right amount of it 
 I'm trying to stay cool and calm 
 When we're living in express mode 
 Tryin' to hustle hard 
 And turn our shack into the penthouse 
 Puddle to a lake 
 Canoe into the love boat 
 Upgrade your life 
 But without sunshine it's sunstroke 
 It's too hot 
 And I realize ÃŒ got a way to go 
 And all I need to get me there 
 Is water and a way to flow 
 If you ain't happy broke 
 You won't be happy rich 
 Don't spend your whole life unhappy 
 Tryin' to capture it 
 Relax a bit 
 Loosen up your suit and tie 
 And your collar quick 
 Before you call it quits 
 And stay cool (yes I will) 
 I stay cool (oh yes I will) 
 I stay cool 
 I stay cool 
 And when you're on your last nerve, stay cool 
 When the heat's on, chill 
 Under pressure, calm down, breathe to the beat 
 Stay cool under pressure 
 Chill when the heat's on 
 Calm down, breathe to the beat 
 And I don't need no stunner shades 
 I keep it cool like a rain shower 
 On a hot summer's day 
 Sweating in the running race 
 Push on (and on) 
 When it's hard for you to go on 
 Cause life's tough and life's fucked 
 And so on and so on 
 The bills don't stop 
 The rent's not paid 
 The baby's crying, mamma's yellin' 
 'Nother hot day 
 And when you sweatin 
 And you bought to blow ya top through the roof 
 Take a breath and breathe man 
 Don't lose your cool (I stay cool) 
 I stay cool (yes I will) 
 I stay cool (oh yes I will) 
 I stay cool 
 And when you're on your last nerve, stay cool 
 When the heat's on, chill 
 Under pressure, calm down, breathe to the beat 
 Stay cool under pressure 
 Chill when the heat's on 
 Calm down, breathe to the beat
