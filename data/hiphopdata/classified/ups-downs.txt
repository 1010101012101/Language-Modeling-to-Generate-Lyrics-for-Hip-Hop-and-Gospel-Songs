Damn, another migraine 
 Vision blurred., eyes strained 
 I need another gel cap 
 Cause once this headache hits it's a sure trip to hell 'n' back 
 I got too much on my mind 
 This lifestyle I lead got my health on decline 
 I ain't as quick thinking as I once was, huh 
 I guess that's what smoking j's and blunt does 
 Even my freestyle getting worse 
 I'm losing it can't connect the missing words 
 And everybody wanna get a verse 
 But when I say I got no time, they get their feeling's hurt 
 Daddy... hey what's up baby girl 
 Your the only thing that make sense in this crazy world 
 Through all the madness and the sickness 
 I know that I can look to you for love and forgiveness 
 What's you momma doing? Oh she's cooking diner 
 Well daddy gotta write this song, go on and cook it with her 
 I'll be in soon, soon as I get finished 
 And tell you mom I'll get the laundry done and do the dishes 
 But who we kidding 
 I can't even do that right 
 I mean I can. But my mind stuck on Halflife 
 I'm trying to find somebody I can pass the mic 
 Who got the drive and will make the same sacrifice I did 
 And yeah I signed a couple guys 
 But I guess I didn't do my job, at least in their eyes 
 I wasted too much time, and some dope beats 
 But it's back to the grind, same old me 
 The sun's shinning again, satisfaction 
 Oh Canada, it just went platinum 
 I'm hitting plateaus, I never thought my rap flows would hit 
 And actually making real cash flow off this shit 
 Last year, I felt like I was everywhere 
 The even heard me from Regis and Kelly's chair 
 The Olympics the Juno's I did it 
 All of this all from one son, I'll admit it 
 Am I a one hit wonder? I don't think I am 
 But the thought crossed my ming, the I erased it 
 And fot the video, we asked everybody out 
 And no black people showes, then they called me racist 
 Maestro told me 
 Stay off the message boards Classy 
 But I'm sick of all these rap geeks 
 Talking out their ass checks 
 Hanging off every word Class speaks 
 But anyway that's last week 
 This week, I'm about to move out 
 I just bought a couple acres and built a new ajouse 
 Shit it feels good to be doing what I love 
 And those who hate, fuck you, I earned what I got 
 I use to think that money changed the man 
 Now I'm thinking that it changes those around you 
 A lot of people wanna hand on and drowned you 
 So I gotta watch the people who surround Luke 
 I Know who my friends are 
 It'll reflect in my memoirs 
 Life's a trip of joy and challenges 
 I just gotta learn to live it and balance it
