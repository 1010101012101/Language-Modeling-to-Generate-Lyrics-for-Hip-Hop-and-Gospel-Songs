They wanna judge, Class, and tell lies too! 
 Walk in a room with my hands on my side, head raised 
 All this gossip and talking reminds me of my WebPage 
 Y?all people give me headaches, it's hard to keep my headstraight 
 It's like trying to go up but held down by deadweight 
 Walk on land, stay interesting 
 9 albums dropped and I can't play an instrumental a lot of people wanna say I'm cheap as fuck 
 Why, 'cause I spend my money on my beats and cuts 
 Y?all peeps speak too much 
 Matter of fact, y?all peeps can eat these two nuts and still peep my new stuff 
 I ain't too ashamed 
 I'll say what's on my mental 
 Trying to quit my job and make a living off my pencil 
 But sometimes 
 People like to open up their mouth 
 Put their nose in my business, kid y?all need a life 
 Since the first day my mom taught me how to read and write 
 I've been spreading my vocab to the land like Jesus Christ 
 Believe the hype, ah yo I'm dope when I speak on mics 
 And when I smoke, pass the paper I don't need a pipe 
 Trust me kid, I'm ending all my nemesis (but class) 
 I'll cut you off in the middle of your sentences 
 Ah damn, anotha mothafucker up 'n' here 
 Running his mouth and putting shit in your ear 
 Ah damn, and I ain't trying to hear what you're saying 
 Stop with the gossip cause it ain't entertaining 
 Ah damn, every time you say my name 
 Try to spread lies through the game 
 Say what you want I won't change 
 They wanna judge, class, and tell lies too! 
 And you can believe me 
 Because I never lie 
 And I'm always right, so wake up! 
 Call me a pasty white kid, whatever, I ain't concerned 
 I can't sun tan I'm too hot, I burn 
 And if I drop I'll return with the status that I left 
 Yeah this is a game and I'm glad their ain't a ref 
 'Cause I'll break rules 
 Take fools for their money and their fake jewels 
 Ah you something's never change 
 And I put in work more ways then one ask your lady 
 You still wanna talk acting like class is lazy 
 I'm like a bum with no legs, I can't stand working 
 But I'll write through the night till my right hands hurting 
 Strike like lightning and kill all the nonsense 
 Son just be honest you never were a profit 
 Now stop it 
 Why you wanna rhyme like you deep now 
 I tried to listen but your putting me to sleep pal 
 I'm flowing better when I freestyle, listen to me speak now 
 Impress your female and keep it on the DL, shhhhhh 
 Somethings are better unsaid 
 Your whole rhyme book is better left unread 
 And I ain't trying to turn this to a battle track 
 But I gotta handle cats, who attempt to battle back 
 Ah damn, anotha mothafucker up 'n' here 
 Running his mouth and putting shit in your ear 
 Ah damn, and I ain't trying to hear what you're saying 
 Stop with the gossip cause it ain't entertaining 
 Ah damn, every time you say my name 
 Try to spread lies through the game 
 Say what you want I won't change 
 They wanna judge, class, and tell lies too! 
 Taking care of business yeah without no doubt class 
 Making people understand, What's going on 
 Making people understand, What's going on 
 Ah damn, anotha mothafucker up 'n' here 
 Running his mouth and putting shit in your ear 
 Ah damn, and I ain't trying to hear what you're saying 
 Stop with the gossip cause it ain't entertaining 
 Ah damn, every time you say my name 
 Try to spread lies through the game 
 Say what you want I won't change 
 They wanna judge, class, and tell lies too!
