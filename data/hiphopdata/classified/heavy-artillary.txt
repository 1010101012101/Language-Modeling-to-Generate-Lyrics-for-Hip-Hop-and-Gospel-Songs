(I live for the moment) 
 (Class got you open) 
 Yo, is you ready for the man steppin in with the, heavy artillery 
 Both hands cocked to the back, ready and willing 
 Spit fire over tracks, ain't feelin' me 
 Judging how I look, not my lyrical abilities 
 Please, this is for my people in the background 
 Stayin out the limelight, moldin how a track sounds 
 (Walk) with my cap down 
 (Class) neva back down 
 (Weight) do the half pound 
 (Fight) till the last round 
 And keep movin, I'm like parker lewis' hair lubes 
 I gotcha runnin' man, with or without dance moves 
 I don't get ???, sometimes I'm just pissed off 
 Drive by your ? wave hi and you get flipped off 
 And it's like that, all I do is write raps 
 Drop beats for hype tracks smoke weed for nightcaps 
 Step up, we strike back 
 Listen how we word it 
 Always underground but I rise to the surface 
 Getto you dem of the heavy artillery 
 That's why all the girls them love we 
 Flex with the friends we no flex with the enemies, 
 'Cause we enemy we wan' come hurt we, 
 And them whole an apology 
 Cause ya know we have the heavy artillery 
 Flex with the friends we no flex with the enemies, 
 'Cause we enemy we wan' come hurt we 
 Yo and when I'm dyin' at home 
 I want a picture on my headstone 
 My microphone, two tables and my headphones 
 Cross-fader, ? in the mpc 
 Restin here? no, producer / emcee, but let's move 
 Sometimes I wanna while out and wanna let loose 
 Puff weed drink brews for an excuse 
 I'm in the wrong state of mind 
 All you flashy rappers talk and I'm here to take your shine 
 Take you props and make them mine 
 So how ya like me now? 
 I see your temper rise and you wanna strike me down 
 But I will stay here, and whether or not I play fair 
 Depends on these rappers actin' like they're needin' daycare 
 Children, stop playin' start buildin' 
 I don't care who you know or if you push the hard million 
 It's hard dealin', I'm almost ready to explode 
 Everybody wanna hate but we really need to grow, lets go 
 Getto you dem of the heavy artillery 
 That's why all the girls them love we 
 Flex with the friends we no flex with the enemies, 
 'Cause we enemy we wan' come hurt we, 
 And them whole an apology 
 Cause ya know we have the heavy artillery 
 Flex with the friends we no flex with the enemies, 
 'Cause we enemy we wan' come hurt we 
 Yo I see ya leanin on the wall with your hands in your back pocket 
 Actin' hard, like you can't feel this, stop it! 
 I know some rappers in the place really can't rock it 
 But when I get up on the mic it's always hot shit 
 Listen as I take you through this 
 Spit from the heart, this is art more than music 
 Half of you are clueless, don't know the real 
 You repeat what you hear and expect a record deal 
 I live for the moment, class gotcha open 
 This is that shit right here, still boastin' 
 I see through ya and I'm finished with the small talk 
 Done wastin time son, you guaranteed to fall off 
 Getto you dem of the heavy artillery 
 That's why all the girls them love we 
 Flex with the friends we no flex with the enemies, 
 'Cause we enemy we wan' come hurt we, 
 And them whole an apology 
 Cause ya know we have the heavy artillery 
 Flex with the friends we no flex with the enemies, 
 'Cause we enemy we wan' come hurt we
