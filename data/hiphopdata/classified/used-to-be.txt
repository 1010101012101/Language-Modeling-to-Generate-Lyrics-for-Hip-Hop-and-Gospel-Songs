Classified: Man, remember tape cassettes? 
 Mic Boyd: Tape cassettes?! 
 Classified: I remember goin' into record stores, gettin' so excited 
 For that new album, you know? 
 When you got it, is was like nothin' else mattered 
 Mic Boyd: Oh yeah, yeah, I guess, you had to pay for that shit 
 Classified: Yeah man, it's not like that anymore 
 Kind of feel, kind of feelin' like damn 
 When they used to say they don't make music like they used to 
 (The way it used to be) 
 Mic Boyd: No, I see what you're sayin' man, I see what you're sayin' 
 Classified: Check this out, look, yeah 
 Mic Boyd: What you got? 
 (Verse 1 - Classified) 
 My, my, my, my dad says they don't make music like they used to 
 And nowadays there ain't no record store to root through 
 We upload and then we viewin it on youtube 
 Digital to Bluetooth, I see why that confuse you 
 This day and age, shit it's hard to tell who's who 
 So many artists, every week you hear a new group 
 Maybe it's me or possibly I got a screw loose 
 A raisin short of two scoops but we don't do what you do (do, do) 
 (Verse 2 - Mic Boyd) 
 Now-now-nowadays when I turn on the radio (yeah) 
 It's like they take the same old song and play it out (true) 
 Might be your favorite now but hated in a day or so 
 Here today, gone tomorrow, that's how the saying goes 
 The oldies were timeless and classic (that's right) 
 Music now is models and actress (ah naw) 
 Who we pay to ogle they asses (yeah) 
 Never liked metal but still prefer it to plastic 
 [Chorus - Classified] (Mic Boyd) - w/ ad libs 
 My dad says they don't make music like they used to 
 (Oh no they don't, no they don't, no they don't) 
 And my crew says they don't make beats like they used to 
 (Oh no they don't, no they don't, no they don't) 
 You know what I-I think? It's just the music that I'm used to 
 (It's what I'm used to, It's what I'm used to) 
 I need my headphones louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, 
 Louder, louder 
 (Verse 3 - Mic Boyd) 
 From machines with touch screens, this must be the future 
 One man band all recorded on computer 
 Cue race tape walkin' Pro Tool users 
 Felt the effects and overused Auto-Tuners 
 If you can't hit the note, then hit a switch 
 Artists can't get the picture and end (*Auto-Tune voice*) "singing like 
 This" 
 Sounds like robots are takin' our jobs 
 While these same record labels keep on payin' 'em off 
 (Verse 4 - Classified) 
 Now have you ever thought about the old records we were proud to play 
 (Yeah) 
 And if you heard them for the first time nowadays? (yeah) 
 Would we give the same props, same amount of praise? (nope) 
 I highly doubt it, hey it'd probably sound out of date (yeah) 
 Or maybe life nowadays kind of cloud our taste (yeah) 
 And hearin old tracks takes us back around the way (woo) 
 Yeah, still soundin great, off that outer space 
 Without a trace, leavin' eardrums bent out of shape 
 [Chorus] - w/ ad libs 
 [Outro] (Sample from "Back in the Day" by Ahmad) 
 Classified: Yeah, the records that I play (back in the days) 
 Mic Boyd: You know the clothes that I wear (back in the days) 
 Classified: Haha, hey yo people! [she know just how I feel] 
 Classified: When? 
 (Back in the days when I was young, I'm not a kid anymore) (*echo*)
