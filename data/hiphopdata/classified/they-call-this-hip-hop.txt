 Classified, you're lookin' familiar 
 (Classified) 
 They call this Hip hop 
 (Royce Da 5'9) 
 Real recognize real 
 Yeah 
 My pradas and guccis 
 Got me tied up with hoochies 
 My hotel room smell like a lot of produce-e 
 I'm a god, I could crucify you 
 Exclude nobody, that means that it's you it applies to 
 If I was you I'd leave it alone 
 I kill you or suicide you 
 You had a choice before they flew inside you 
 The best rapper alive, you better ask around 
 I got coke in a hole with a nose like a basset hound 
 You step up I guarantee you I'ma back you down 
 Ask around, you show fear and get slapped around 
 Lets put the track aside 
 I fuck with Classified 
 Big balls, she suck my dick she gonna move the sack aside 
 Don't fuck with rappin' guys 
 That toast'll pop up like a gat surprise 
 My motto is kill track or die 
 Beef forget it now 
 Your piece set it down 
 I done already touched more kids than a pedophile 
 (Classified) 
 Yeah, don't matter where you from 
 Where you came or where you're goin' 
 Keep it movin, get 'em movin 
 Haha I'm ready for it all 
 Got my back against the wall 
 But I'm ready, never fall 
 They call this hip hop 
 (B.O.B.) 
 It's the game that pays me 
 But somehow lately the game's been crazy 
 Ya I'm an 80's baby 
 So ya my momma made me but hip hop raised me 
 (Classified) 
 My favorite rap album ever 
 Jeeze, let me see 
 Somewhere in between blueprint by Jay-Z 
 Or either Dre CD's 
 Or maybe Illmatic by Nas 
 Or possibly doggystyle by snoop dogg 
 Lived it like religion 
 Critics call it modern day sorcery 
 'Cause I follow accordingly 
 To what rappers reported to me 
 Ah, started listenin around the age of 12 
 And it changed the way I felt 
 Plus the way I raised myself 
 It never taught me shoot a gun 
 Or go and buy drugs 
 It taught me how to keep it real 
 And don't be scared of who I was 
 It taught me how to grab a mic 
 And grow an appetite 
 To sacrifice bougie rapper types 
 Corny act-a-likes 
 I've never been upstaged 
 Off the wrong stage 
 You can write your verse good 
 But I'ma write my songs great 
 Never was I poured on 
 No rappers co-signed me 
 That's why the attitude, asshole 
 So don't mind me. 
 Yeah, don't matter where you from 
 Where you came or where you're goin' 
 Keep it movin, get 'em movin 
 Haha I'm ready for it all 
 Got my back against the wall 
 But I'm ready, never fall 
 (B.O.B.) 
 Well these are not just verbs that I recite 
 Its actually a verse of encouragement 
 And advice 
 And everything is perfectly worded 
 The way you like 
 So I can make some currency 
 Just to service my life 
 Really I've been workin with verbage all of my life 
 So when I die, they gonna bury me with the mic 
 And when I go, please do not worry, I'm in the sky 
 Then and there you'll see, apparently I'm a psychic 
 A heavyweight, don't refer to me lightly 
 So when you speak to me, speak to me politely 
 I'm like a paycheck before you get fired 
 You need me in the game, so basically I'm hired 
 Bombin on you guys like Allen Iverson 
 They like damn, here's this guy again 
 He's on fire, we need a fire hydrant then 
 His screw's loose, get some plyers in and tighten them. 
 (Classified) 
 Yeah, don't matter where you from 
 Where you came or where you're goin' 
 Keep it movin, get 'em movin 
 Haha I'm ready for it all
