I'm the type of kid who wears jogging pants to your downtown scene 
 Stay comfortable with a pound of brown weed 
 Lounge around streets and down a few Keiths, 
 Pound a few beats, y'all know the sound is unique 
 Now, who is this, Class, last man standing 
 Gas can in hand trying to blast Grand Canyons 
 What, I gotta act hard to be a rap star? 
 I grew up in the sticks fighting hicks in my backyard 
 Ain't nothing pretty, far from the grimiest 
 Started in the 90's and it's still hard to find me 
 Sitting on the benches, still independent 
 But a Halflife artists, attacks mics hardest 
 So open up your eyes, hold back, stop the talking 
 I speak to individuals so listen through a walkman 
 I know I say it often, hard to understand 
 But I'm sick of doing shows in front of 25 fans 
 We know, y'all ain't ready 
 People, won't expect me 
 Class, stay ahead of this 
 Y'all, reap the benefits 
 Your whole steeze is devilish 
 And that's why, we ending it! 
 We know, y'all ain't ready 
 People, won't expect me 
 Class, stay ahead of this 
 Y'all, reap the benefits 
 Your whole steeze is devilish 
 And that's why, we ending it! 
 Now I don't walk with a limp, I walk with a swagger in my step 
 Nova Scotia kid putting majors to the test 
 Behavior is a mess, stressed, wanna put this dagger in your chest 
 Feel like laying ya to rest 
 But I calmed down and keep my head up 
 Ignoring all these wack rap cats who got me fed up 
 Doing this for class so fuck all the challengers 
 You wanna get your talent heard, well let me mark it on my calendar 
 And we can do this, rhyme for rhyme, who's fluid 
 I let me frustrations out strictly through music 
 That's why I'm laid back when I talk all the time 
 But I'll smash you in the melon if you cross that line 
 Listen, I ain't trying to make this physical now 
 Ya pitiful pal, comparing to my lyrical style 
 A mile a minute, moving, keep running laps 
 Making heads turn till I hear something snap 
 We know, y'all ain't ready 
 People, won't expect me 
 Class, stay ahead of this 
 Y'all, reap the benefits 
 Your whole steeze is devilish 
 And that's why, we ending it! 
 We will be here 
 For Ever 
 Better recognize and try to analyze this 
 Get what I'm saying 
 Yo, Grade 6, smart mouth teen 
 I thought I was the shit wearing acid wash jeans 
 Now I'm trying to take over this rap and rock scene 
 Testing all teams when I'm letting off steam 
 Effecting y'all beans, my flow is to dope 
 If I smoke another rapper, I'll need a hole in my throat 
 Never smoked weed all through senior high school. 
 It just wasn't for me, I wrote rhymes recorded beats 
 But now, ah yo, I'm known to get stoned quick 
 Get up on the net and start bootlegging my own shit 
 Grown kid, still throws fits 
 Attack tracks with rap and stay focused 
 We know, y'all ain't ready 
 People, won't expect me 
 Class, stay ahead of this 
 Y'all, reap the benefits 
 Your whole steeze is devilish 
 And that's why, we ending it! 
 We know, y'all ain't ready 
 People, won't expect me 
 Class, stay ahead of this 
 Y'all, reap the benefits 
 Your whole steeze is devilish 
 And that's why, we ending it!
