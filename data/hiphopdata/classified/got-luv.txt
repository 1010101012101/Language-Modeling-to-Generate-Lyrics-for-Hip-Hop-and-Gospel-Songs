Yeah, yo... Listen 
 Now I've got love for somethings that I gotta confess 
 Got a lot of small talk that I'm putting to rest 
 Gotta beat guaranteed that'll snap ya neck 
 I got love for my weed and my unemployment checks 
 (Yes) I'm still making my call 
 Love my girl, this world, but don't recycle at all 
 I got love for player haters, fuck it, I am one 
 I'm jealous as hell, I'm waiting for my chance son 
 I do this hands on 
 Still in progress... Still ain't won, but I guess I never lost yet 
 I gotta give it up to MC's who spit dope 
 (Why?) Cause you inspire me to double check what I wrote 
 Wack MC's love it when they come out 
 Cause wack rappers, give me something to write about 
 Like right now, you bite, and I'll bite down 
 Cut you off, you out of sight now 
 Critics, gotta love them, put your flame up 
 'Cause when you dissing, you make me step my game up 
 Check the change up, been I'll since I came up 
 Runnin' this on empty and still fill your brain up 
 Now let me get this off my brian 
 I got love for some things 
 That I never thought could happen 
 But anything could change 
 I got love for my people and everyone of my foes 
 And anyone in this game who keeps me fresh on my toes 
 Everyone's a rapper now, their ain't no Hip Hop fans 
 Everybody's on the mic, it's time to get off man 
 You ain't built for the game I hit like rock bands 
 Your fruity loops beats don't hit like "Ah Damn!" 
 Ex 9 to 5'er 
 Class, still building 
 And with a small studio 
 And doing shows at the pavilion 
 I use to love getting taxed by the government 
 Cause now I'm home, getting paid and I'm loving it 
 Yo, I got laid off 
 Now I'm paid off 
 For the next year or so 
 So I got a year to blow 
 Understand? I always have a plan and I'll follow it 
 Spit this with pride, 'cause you'll never see me swallow it 
 Plus 
 You gotta love a girl with class 
 And if you can't understand then go back and do the math 
 I ain't a conscious rapper but still state my views 
 I'm a kid at heart, watching sports entertainment pay per views 
 And I hating you, kid I got love 
 Go ahead and diss me spread my name through the club 
 I could use the marketing, huh I got the skill 
 I just gotta get my name out and continue to build 
 Now let me get this off my brain 
 I got love for some things 
 That I never thought could happen 
 But anything could change 
 I got love for my people and everyone of my foes 
 And anyone in this game who keeps me fresh on my toes
