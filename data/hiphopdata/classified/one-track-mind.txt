One track mind, focused on important shit, 
 Eyes on the prize, one track mind (yeah, you gotta) 
 One track mind (ha ha yeah) focused on important shit 
 Eyes on the prize (yo I gotta little story for ya) 
 One track mind 
 Yeah, now Davy works hard in the dark yard 
 But wants to be a rock star, drivin' fast cars, 
 Livin' large, getting girls like an all-star, 
 Filthy rich knockin' hits out the ball park 
 With his Les Paul Guitar and his call card. 
 He fell in love with the music, it was all hard, 
 And when you reach high sometimes you fall far. 
 You gotta give it all you got once the job starts, 
 Focus everyday, similin' when he played 
 His finger prints took a beat and almost fade away. 
 His family didn't know, or couldn't understand, 
 They thought he'd snap out of this like a rubber band, 
 But we know he seems (gone) got his first taste 
 A couple show dates always coming home late 
 At the break of (dawn) his girls sleepin' 
 Barely ever see him 'cause he's gigin' on the weekend 
 And when he was around it was like his mind wasn't 
 His girl would talk to him but he never heard nothin' 
 Mind always racin' a race against time 
 That's a one track mind 
 One track mind (ha ha yeah) focused on important shit 
 Eye's on the prize (I can see it) one track mind 
 Got a one track I'm focused on important shit 
 Give me some time, I only need a little bit. 
 Got a one track mind now I'm focused one focusing 
 I'm hittin' my stride and everybody's noticing 
 (Ooh, now look here) 
 Brooke is like the girl that we all know (all know) 
 Dressed to impress, like a model (model) 
 Only wore clothes with a brand name 
 She never shopped Target, she had a bad aim 
 She got her hair and nails did almost everyday 
 Said she liked the attention that it sent away 
 And when she's done up right she likes everybody noticing 
 Looks for the praise lets the compliment soak in. 
 But on a bad day, and by a bad day 
 I mean a bad hair day, don't know what to wear day, 
 She don't go out, don't feel comfortable 
 Without the accessories she don't feel presentable 
 She always worries what she looks like, 
 She thinks everybody worries what she looks like. 
 Her own man's sick and tired so he took flight 
 She knows he loved her but he couldn't deal with Brooke's hype 
 She thought appearance was the only thing important 
 Left everything else on the back burner, boilin'. 
 Eyes on the prize, focused on the goal line, 
 That's a one track mind 
 One track mind (hey hey), focused on important shit 
 Eyes on the prize (yeah you got a) one track mind 
 One track mind, focused on important shit 
 Eyes on the prize, one track mind (pick it up) 
 Got a one track I'm focused on important shit 
 Give me some time, I only need a little bit. 
 Got a one track mind now I'm focused one focusing 
 I'm hittin' my stride and everybody's noticing 
 Joel Plaskett (Ooh) 
 And that's Classified
