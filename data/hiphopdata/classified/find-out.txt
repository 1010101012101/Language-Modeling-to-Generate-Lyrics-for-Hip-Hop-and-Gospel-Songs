 What's goin' on? 
 (You gonna find out) 
 Sooner or later 
 (You gonna find out) 
 Are you ready for this? 
 (You gonna find out) 
 Tell em'who it is 
 (Your gonna find out) 
 Put your hands up 
 Man up 
 Look up 
 Find out 
 Cut through the rope 
 Nope 
 Not stayin tied down 
 Gone for a minute 
 Yup 
 Back on the grind now 
 Thought I was finished 
 Nope 
 Not jerry seinfeld 
 Whos this? 
 Guess who 
 Back to stay 
 Get more use outta class than a plastic bag 
 Moms still lookin' at me like act your age 
 'Cause Friday and Saturday I'm either trashed or blazed 
 I don't fascinate 
 I live it 
 That's it 
 I even bought a house 
 Off of writin' rap shit 
 But don't get it twisted 
 I ain't that rich 
 'Cause I'm payin' off the loan till I'm in a casket 
 Country boy 
 Move out to the city life 
 Back to the sticks 
 With the family and minibike 
 Yet nothin' change 
 Spit rhymes nicest 
 This games givin' me a mid life crisis 
 This whole thing failed to amaze me 
 Since the 80's 
 This hip-hop thing basically raised me 
 But lately everyone's gun is off safety 
 What happened to the culture 
 Breakers and the break beats 
 When I was 18 
 Never cared to make green 
 I'd write rhymes 
 Turn this day job into a daydream 
 And now a day it's all changing 
 Guess I'm growin' up 
 'Cause I wonder what the fuck are we raising 
 Used to be a culture 
 Now it's all a hustle 
 Used to flex skills 
 Now we flex biceps 
 I flip flows you ain't tried yet 
 Make you expect the unexpected 
 Sit and get your mindset 
 Culture shark 
 I talk the talk 
 And I'm a dying breed 
 Still trying to eat 
 I'm a MC first (always) 
 Buisness last 
 That's probaby why I made no real cash as class 
 (But I can live with that) 
 Now I don't hate gangster rap 
 Someone fakin' jacks 
 Trying to glorify it 
 With hopes in makin' cash 
 Steal from a culture 
 And never pay it back 
 Hate repeatin' myself 
 But I gotta state the facts 
 Most kids know 
 That it's an entertainment purpose 
 10% Don't tho and wanna be that person 
 Wanna sell drugs 
 Hold guns 
 Pimp hoes 
 Buy blades 
 Waste money 
 Rob people 
 Get dough 
 I know things change 
 And I'm fine with it 
 But now where gettin' judged 
 On the crimes we did 
 Or the dimes we hit 
 Or the lines we snitch 
 We used to get props for the rhymes we spit 
 What happened?
