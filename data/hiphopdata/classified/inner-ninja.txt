Ninja? You're a ninja? Get out of here, you're a ninja 
 Yes, I am a ninja 
 I read the rules before I broke 'em 
 I broke the chains before they choked me out 
 Now I pay close attention 
 Really learn the code 
 I learned to read the map before I hit the road 
 Hey yo, I know you never heard this before 
 But I'd rather lose a fight than miss the war 
 And I ain't wishing competition or fishin' for it 
 I'm just living in the system, conditions are poor 
 I've been lost in the rhythm and misinformed 
 Too many late nights hittin' the liquor store 
 Too many bad decisions, half assed attempts 
 No sweat, no fear, no blood, no tears 
 I go hard and I ain't makin' up no excuse 
 I'm overdue, I don't do what I'm supposed to do 
 'Cause you can think about it man, we're supposed to lose 
 It ain't all picture perfect, ocean views 
 No, I was a first class rookie 
 Takin' out bullies in my all black hoodie 
 Man of mystery, you know the history 
 Get it or forget it, cause poof, I'm outta here 
 I read the rules before I broke 'em 
 I broke the chains before they choked me out 
 And I pay close attention 
 Really learn the code 
 I learned to read the map before I hit the road 
 Nobody's gonna see me comin' 
 Nobody's gonna hear a sound 
 No matter how hard they tryin' 
 No stoppin' me since I've found 
 My inner ninja 
 Hey yo, I've been high and I've been real low 
 I've been beaten and broken but I healed though 
 So many ups and downs, roughed up
