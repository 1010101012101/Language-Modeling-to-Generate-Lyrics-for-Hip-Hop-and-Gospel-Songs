Hello? Hello? Hello! 
 Anybody listenin'? 
 Yeah No reply at all 
 Is anybody listenin'? 
 Oh No reply at all 
 Is anybody listenin'? 
 Oh There's no reply at all 
 Now this is more than a business 
 Much more than a kid tryin' to get rich 
 Live this like it's an addiction 
 Spit this whether anybody listens 
 I don't know if you really hearin' me 
 But these lyrics seem to be my therapy 
 Guaranteed, I hear the beat 
 My stress gets released till I feel at peace 
 And I feel pretty fortunate 
 Even though I never made a fortune yet 
 A lot of these cats tryin' to make it in rap 
 They get nothin' back, no feedback their whole life 
 Somethin' to say with no mic 
 Incredible skill but no hype I spit it for the ones never heard 
 Who spend everyday tryin' to make this work but 
 Is anybody listenin'? 
 Oh There's no reply at all 
 Is anybody listenin'? 
 Oh There's no reply at all 
 Yeah, uh, okay, here we go again 
 Roll the weed and put the stereo to ten 
 You know what you got in your boombox 
 Bangin' unorthodox like Boondock Saints is 
 Take notes on how I stay dope 
 Upgrade the flow and keep the fake out 
 Bend the example, play the scapegoat 
 But I shoot to get high and go damn low 
 Now could I take attendance 
 And give props to those who pay attention? 
 Listen to the flow and the way that we blend 'em 
 When we create an event we did it all independent 
 Come on, it'll only take a minute 
 Same old plasma, they're Yankee fitted 
 Still in field, never changed the digits 
 I'm cool where I'm at, don't hate, just listen 
 Come on 
 Is anybody listenin'? 
 Oh There's no reply at all 
 Is anybody listenin'? 
 Oh No reply at all 
 Yeah, one two, one two 
 Look, this is more than beats and hooks 
 Thieves and crooks or readin' books 
 More then gettin' lifted, the way your boy twisted 
 Friday night in the club, double fisted 
 This shit's the way of life 
 I know it's clich√© but my DJ say 
 I'm right We eat, breath this without a recess 
 Always on the mind like priests with Jesus 
 Playing it out, get strategic 
 Write my life like a thesis I break this down into pieces 
 Nope, no fluke, work hard to achieve this 
 Beat bang but still I speak 
 And spit with substance that will fill my needs 
 Treat hip hop like it's my religion 
 So yeah, I'm sincere, thank you for listenin' 
 Is anybody listenin'? 
 Oh There's no reply at all 
 Is anybody listenin'? 
 Oh No reply at all 
 Is anybody listenin'? 
 Oh There's no reply at all 
 Is anybody listenin'? 
 Oh No reply at all
