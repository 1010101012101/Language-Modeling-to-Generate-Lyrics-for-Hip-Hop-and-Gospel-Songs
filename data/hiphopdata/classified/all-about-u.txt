Chad Hatch: 
 Life's not what you take 
 It's not about the promises you make 
 It's not about the friends you might've made 
 Or love that is gone 
 Life is what you give 
 It's not about the stupid things you did 
 It's not about the way things could've been 
 It's about movin' on 
 It's all about you 
 So every morning when wake, before the first step that you take 
 Just think it's all what you make it 
 And you'll make it through 
 Classified: 
 This life will leave you stressed out, left out with your neck out 
 Ain't nothing changed 
 It's real life so we deal right but it feels like it's something strange 
 We wonderin' the dumbest things and let everything get under our skin 
 Trouble again, tryin' to impress someone else. It's fucked in the head 
 So do you, you'll never make everyone happy. It just won't happen 
 At the end of day, when all say is said, you better be ready to go back 
 At'em 
 I learn slow, my verse shows my growth, my wisdom 
 If you positive, or you negative, it don't make a difference not when you 
 Live it 
 Cause some of the most successful people on this planet 
 Will kill themselves for somebody else's like they really couldn't manage 
 Then we got bums, alcoholics on the streets 
 With no stress, no where to rest, no where to dress, no where to sleep 
 And they say fuck my morals. I'm drinkin' away my sorrows 
 I'm livin' life and I'm happy, I ain't thinking about tomorrow 
 Chad Hatch: 
 Life is what it brings 
 It's not about cars and fancy things 
 Or hairsalons and diamond rings 
 Girls don't lose no sleep 
 Life is all about the things you'll never figure out 
 It's all about the people you allow in and the memories that you keep 
 Classified: 
 This here is life so tell me who choses what's wrong and right 
 Is it what we see on TV? Get a job, raise a family 
 That's how I was raised, how I was brought up 
 Get a wife, a son and daughter 
 That's how I was taught to be proper 
 Never thought anyone could get caught up 
 And slowly I grew up and the fairytale quickly vanished 
 Realized that life is a bitch and shit, you gotta be able to stand it 
 And you gotta be able to handle it, this stress and the pressure, you 
 Channel it... 
 And you learn to cope at the end of your rope anyway that you can with 
 Liquor or dope 
 Or work hard, raise your kids. Strip clubs, whatever it is 
 Smoke weed, shoot hoops, whatever you find your happiness through 
 It's your life. Just make sure you know what you want when you go out 
 And get it 
 Keep doing this shit for you, not your crew or the dude you're tryna 
 Impress, kid 
 Life is simple, life is hard and yeah life is fun 
 So enjoy the things around you before your life is done
