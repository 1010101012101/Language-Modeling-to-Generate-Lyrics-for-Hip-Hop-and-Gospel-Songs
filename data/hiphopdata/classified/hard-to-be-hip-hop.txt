Verses alternate between Classified and Maestro starting with Maestro 
 Yo Class how you doing? Dude, I'm back in the Fax 
 I'm taking time off the act and I gotta relax 
 I need a new beat 
 Yo Freshtro I got a few treats 
 You been up in the city long? 
 Nah, only two weeks 
 Cool well, I'm sorry 'bout the weather 
 It's been raining all week I hope it gets a little better 
 Either way Class listen, I got a ill vision 
 'Bout a song I'm working on, you think you got the right rhythm? 
 Man c'mon, you know I got some shit that'll break your neck 
 I used up what I want but you can take what's left 
 Don't give me bullshit dog, you know I blazed a set 
 You know you got something saved for Wes 
 I got a ill concept hip hop 
 How to pay a real line? This is why 
 1987 I be reppin in the ciphers and the sessions 
 And I still be gettin' stressin 
 You know it's hard to be hip hop 
 And ain't nobody stayin real 
 Don't pay bills when you showcase skill 
 Ain't nobody living off of doing windmills, 
 I'm painting train rails, that's real 
 It's hard to be hip hop 
 You know it's hard to be hip hop 
 It's hard to be hip hop 
 You know it's hard to be hip hop 
 But we gotta be hip hop 
 I got no gassy grills, so my raps ain't real 
 'Cause I don't pack steel through my tracks appeal 
 And to the mass appeal watch how fast they fail 
 Yeah I'm hip hop son, that's how my casket's sealed 
 It's hard in a culture when the fans are fickled 
 Understand my issue, your old man will diss you 
 One minute you're whack and then your jam's official 
 And then they switch again, 
 Two bottles of cancer hit you 
 First they loved L.L. 
 Then they hated him 
 And then they loved him again 
 Then they degraded him 
 So lately, basically, I don't know if I can play to win 
 Survival of the fittest, let me see what kind of shape I'm in 
 Yo 'stro when I was younger like 19 
 I could spend all day writing rhyme schemes 
 Spittin', freestylin', cypherin' the streets 
 But now I got responsibilities 
 Yo it's hard to be hip hop 
 You know it's hard to be hip hop 
 It's hard to be hip hop 
 You know it's hard to be hip hop 
 But we gotta be hip hop 
 No this is not an illusion 
 No this is not an illusion 
 No this is not an illusion 
 No this is not an illusion 
 Cats are killing me Luke 
 Thinking life's like a video shoot 
 They ain't spittin' the truth 
 True, I got a similar view 
 But I guess that's the damage the industry do 
 I'm 28 unemployed, a grown ass man 
 Still trying to rap with no fall back plan 
 Go all out fan you got nothing to lose 
 'Cause only to yourself you got something to prove 
 Yeah we gotta be hip hop it's all that we know 
 Blaze up the shelto' 'stro 
 Yo on with the show 
 Get the drum track going 
 Yeah enough small talk 
 But whatever you drop, keep it hot 
 It's gotta be hip hop 
 You know it's hard to be hip hop 
 It's hard to be hip hop 
 You know it's hard to be hip hop 
 But we gotta be hip hop, gotta be hip hop
