 Where you at?! (Where you at) 
 I'm right here 
 Can you feel that passion (can you feel that passion) 
 Can you feel that passion (can you feel that passion) 
 Yeah 
 Inside the place, with all the bass 
 With all all the bass 
 With all all the bass 
 Yeah 
 Inside the place, with all the bass (I feel like a rap star) 
 With all all the bass 
 With all all the bass 
 Yeah 
 I go to sleep, every night with a couple of girls (huh?) 
 'Cause my daughters won't sleep in their own bed 
 Not what you think, I don't do it for the chicks, or the kicks 
 I'ma do it for myself, and my homestead 
 Going hard, and I do it from afar 
 While I'm shooting for the stars, like a telescope lens 
 I ain't talking 'bout rap, I'm talking 'bout where I'm at in my life 
 Accelerate until the road ends 
 (Keep it real) Used to be the sayin' 
 Now it's fake it and see who can make it, I'm just sayin' 
 My fan base changed, but my sounds still classic 
 Show me anybody else this passionate 
 I'm an outcast, a blast from the past 
 I'm pasty as hell, and my fashion is trash 
 But ain't nobody matchin' the passion of Class 
 So I don't need your props, or the pats on the back 
 I'm good 
 Some get high, and some get low 
 I give you my heart and soul 
 I give you passion, my passion 
 I give you my pa-pa-passion 
 Some get high, and some get low 
 I give you my heart and soul 
 I give you my everything 
 Until I lose control 
 And then I gotta let, go 
 Too the left and (go!) too the right and, (go!) 
 Too the left and (go!) too the right and... 
 I've never felt this way before (yeah) 
 I've never felt this way before 
 Yeah 
 Now every morning when I wake up, I wake up ahead 
 Aches and pains, I break the chains 
 Split personality, razor cane 
 And I don't get your reality, David Blaine 
 You gotta go hard, or go home, feel the pressure 
 But every now and then, get away, go adventure 
 Drink that spiced rum, smoke till the nights done 
 But don't say where you got the advice from 
 Yeah, I'm a great role model, 'cause I don't quit shit 
 I'ma sip the whole bottle 
 I'm so thirsty, I'm hungry, my belly keeps rumblin' 
 Tryin' to make something out of nothing 
 The mix master, made it in the game 
 Never had to dis rappers 
 Or have the it factor, I pull the plug on your misconception 
 And I ain't even talkin' 'bout my skin complexion 
 Some get high, and some get low 
 I give you my heart and soul 
 I give you passion, my passion 
 I give you my pa-pa-passion 
 Some get high, and some get low 
 I give you my heart and soul 
 I give you my everything 
 Until I lose control 
 And then I gotta let, go 
 Too the left and (go!) too the right and, (go!) 
 Too the left and (go!) too the right and... 
 I've never felt this way before 
 I've never felt this way before 
 I had this kid ask me if I really write my rhymes (wa-WHAT?!) 
 I guess it's just a sign of the times 
 Lemme check (one-two) Yeah these rhymes is mine 
 It's the life of the party kid, we wine and dine 
 Get your hands to the sky, high, rise and shine 
 And keep your eyes wide open till the blinds recline 
 Half man and an animal, designed to grind 
 I'ma mix into another mankind combined (I'ma beast!) 
 And the passions, coming from the sunnn 
 Yeah, I'm the compulsive (obsessive) 
 With a small touch of OC 
 Always on the go so, watch as we proceed 
 And I will never OD 
 But my flow leaves slow from my soul 
 Like a nose bleed 
 No sleep late nights gettin' crows feet 
 I can't quit it man 
 This passion controls me 
 Some get high, and some get low 
 I give you my heart and soul (Yeah) 
 I give you passion, my passion 
 I give you my pa-pa-passion 
 Some get high, and some get low, (uh-huh) 
 I give you my heart and soul (yeah) 
 I give you my everything 
 Until I lose control 
 Yeah, yeah and then I gotta let, go 
 Too the left then (go!) too the right and, (go!) 
 Too the left then (go!) too the right and... 
 I've never felt this way before 
 I've never felt this way before 
 I never, I never... 
 But Now I'm inside the place, with all the bass 
 With all all the bass 
 With all all the bass
