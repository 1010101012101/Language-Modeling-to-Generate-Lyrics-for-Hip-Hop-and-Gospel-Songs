It Goes 
 Welcome to Danger Bay 
 Where everybody acts up in the strangest ways 
 In this place when it pours 
 It rains for days 
 Ain't no love left only that hate remains 
 Walk with me, escape or face the flames 
 Type of place you don't know your neighbour's name 
 And in danger bay there ain't no heroes 
 Naw they only wanna kill 'em and be the villain like scarecrow 
 It's a place where the athletes and entertainers 
 Are more valued then the doctors and educators 
 And they all lost faith in their lord 
 And the ones who haven't they don't go to church, they go to war 
 It's a place where the wicked are rewarded, and money and the power's too important 
 The skies turning grey and the ocean turned black, I think we in too far and we can't turn back 
 Welcome to danger bay 
 Don't wanna go back, don't wanna go back 
 Welcome To Danger Bay 
 How will You survive through the fires and the winds of change? 
 Welcome To Danger Bay 
 You better change directions or count your blessings 
 Four, three, two, one 
 You ever been to a place like this? where they have no shame and they show no sorrow? 
 You ever been to a place like this? where to laugh at another man's pain is normal? 
 It's hard to believe what it used to be, a beautiful scene for the human being 
 Then they started polluting the streets, abusing the land and love grew into greed 
 Then the earthquakes rumbled and the gods rained down as the winds and the hurricanes blew from the sea 
 The buildings crumbled and the fires spread while the wild tornadoes uprooted the trees 
 So much hate, so little love, is it the apocalypse we in the middle of? 
 Will this world burn, freeze, or will it flood? Shit I dunno I'm trying to stay afloat in 
 Danger Bay 
 Don't wanna go back, don't wanna go back 
 Welcome To Danger Bay 
 How will You survive through the fires and the winds of change? 
 Welcome To Danger Bay 
 You better change directions or count your blessings 
 Shit We Livin' in Danger Bay 
 I Don't wanna go back, Don't wanna go back 
 Yeah we livin' in Danger Bay 
 I Don't wanna go back, I Don't wanna go back
