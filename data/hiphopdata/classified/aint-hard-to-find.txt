Yeah, I know never took it serious 
 But then what we had got fucked up 
 We grew along but in my heart I still love ya 
 Back at the start I thought it last so long 
 Went by so fast, now it feels like the passion is gone 
 Everything I loved about you just got pissed away 
 And it really gets to me 'cause I miss them days 
 You was modest, honest, pretty much a goddess 
 The farthest thing from bitchy or heartless 
 You never thought less of a jobless pothead 
 And even though I couldn't get you cards or chocolate 
 You put up with my nonsense day after day 
 You were one of the type you don't let get away 
 Shit we used to looped together 
 I remember the time you was so sick, we almost puked together 
 Your mood was better than 
 But who would've knew what we had we would soon lose forever 
 Damn, I still love ya 
 You left, you were like my sunshine you were to young for love but I knew you'd be mine had to let you go and move on with my life now I got you back ain't no leaving this time and I know I can always rely and I know you'll be keeping me high now I won't let you go 'cause I know I learned my lesson. I know I can't take it serious I gotta know if your feeling us, this time of love ain't hard to find but I know your always on my mind. I know I can't take it serious 'cause I know that your feeling us, this time of love ain't hard to find but I know your always on my mind. 
 Yeah, I'm going through the same thing right now man 
 I gotta say something on this one 
 Okay, yeah, I know 
 I said wouldn't do it, but I did it 
 And now I got me wishin the position was switchin 
 Never no hugs, no tongue, never kissin' 
 But keep fuckin' with it since the first day I hit it 
 The minute that talked I would listen 
 You made the way that I walk a little different 
 I like your vibe, like the way the that you feel 
 You had style from the start, now you payin' my bills 
 I gotta love it, yeah I'm a little obsessed 
 And I confess without you I feel a little depressed 
 The wifes had it, sick of giving you my attention 
 Really, I see her point, but it was never my intention 
 I'm always talking and bringing you up 
 Like yo, check this, is she amazing or what 
 And the phatter that you get, the better, I can't complain 
 The mistress in my life, music before the fame 
 I love it
