Yeah 
 Let me talk to the women for a second 
 You see I know what I got and I know it don't get much better than that 
 But at the same time some times I see these girls and I'm like damn... you know? 
 Back in the day they never paid me much attention 
 But I guess what they say is true 
 When your taken your alot more tempting 
 Yeah, I like a girl when she smilin' but some how it make me frown mentally it kinda break me down 
 See I always keep a real talk that's how I shake my sound. 
 So when my wife hear the track she might hate me now 
 This ain't what you used to it's a sure rabuddle 
 It's a scoreless settle made me more than trouble 
 As a kid girls tole me I was bored and level now they feelin' and tellin' me I'm a gorgeous fellow 
 WOW I appreciate that, thank you very much you look really good too but I ain't supposed to touch 
 I told you before class ain't this appetite 
 Buts it's a fact in life 
 Gotta keep a happy wife 
 And I ain't perfect, nope, there ain't a man who is 
 Its just sometimes I think I need the chance to live 
 And my girl isn't stupid, she knows what's up 
 With these hoes and sluts, and all my shows and stuff dancin on the dance floor tryin' to show their stuff another girl front row trin to hold my nuts 
 But I'm a man so I glance and I soak it up 
 But if I take it any further tho I know I'm f***ed 
 It's like damn 
 You know what I mean 
 I see these girls on the street like damn 
 Goin' to the mall right I saw a girl on the bus like damn 
 On tour I saw these girls on the road like damn 
 I can't do a damn thing I gotta look fast 'cause I'm lookin' at my ring 
 Yeah huh it feels good 
 Most the time things feel good you ain't supposed to do 
 Like I said I ain't perfect 
 But I'm tryin' to be hah yeaa yeah 
 Now I don't usually write tracks about dealin' wit chicks 
 Exept wats real and that's as real as it gets 
 I just write about life and how I'm dealin' with it 
 I don't decide on what I spit on or how appealin it is... nope 
 I ain't the guy with the girl have naked in his video tryin' to give a half ass titty show 
 Don't need a dick tease clothed on my TV 
 I watched a mass on the internet to releave me 
 I love a girl with some curves and shape 
 Lookin' innocent but freakin when we're burnin J 
 I see girls on the street and I wonder what if? 
 Then I lose all control and think of my dick 
 Think about sexin sweatin switchin positions 
 Then I think about my giel and if we switched positions and if she was wearin my shoes and had the same chance 
 I know I couldn't take it sein her touchin another man 
 I gotta keep the truth and between and me and you made a promise to eachother and I'm tryin' to see it true girl 
 Its hard tho shit I can't lie cause alot of beautiful women are catchin my eye like damn... 
 I see this girl at the beach like damn 
 When we go to the club right Id see these girls and I'm like damn 
 I see these girls all the time like damn 
 I can't do a damn thing 
 I gotta look fast 'cause I'm starin' at my ring yeah hah there's alot of beautiful women around 
 I can peak right? 
 You know I'm tryin' to keep things as real as possible my girl 
 As much as I see these days 
 I just hope she understands me 
 But then again she's the only girl that understands me
