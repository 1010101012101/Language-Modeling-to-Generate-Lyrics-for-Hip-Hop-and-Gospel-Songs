"*Dial tone, then numbers bein' dialed*" 
 Dr. Dre:

 (Rudy Ray Moore: "Chestnuts") 
 "I wanna ask you one question 
 If I had some nuts hangin' on the walls, what did I have honey?" 
 I said, "Darlin' you'd have some walnuts." 
 She said, "Well... daddy if I had some nuts on my chest, would those be chestnuts?" 
 I said, "Hell yes!" 
 She said, "Well daddy if I had nuts under my chin would those be chin-nuts?" 
 I said, "Hell no bitch you'd have a dick in your mouth!" "*echoes*"

 Dr. Dre: 
 Back with some shit that gots to bump 
 As a pull up in the park you pops the trunk 
 Just to floss you like a muthafuker, clownin' their shit 
 Gots the Dana's on your hootie and your fly ass bitch 
 Throw off, go off, show off, I take that hoe 
 If she proper, I'm a pop her the hole hopper 
 It's back on the track 
 With big money, big nuts & a big fat chronic sack. 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 So Daz, step up on the ass 
 And give these muthafuckers a blast from the past. 
 Daz: 
 Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote 
 With my nigga D R E, so you know I must be dope 
 But uh, Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat that ass 
 Startin' static with Dre, make way for the AK 
 That I bring as I slang like cavy 
 Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy 
 Had he not known about the city I'm from 
 Long Beach, tic tac, grab your gat, watch your back 
 Here I come, stompin' in my kakhi suit 
 BG from the hood can fuck Eastwood 
 God damn, I ripped up, flipped up and skipped up 
 On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling. 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 But did you raise up all These Nuts? 
 Cause Dr. Drizzay's about to rizzip shit up. 
 [Daz:] Chiggie check. 
 [Dr. Dre:] Microphone check 1. 
 [Daz:] Chiggie check. 
 [Dr. Dre:] Microphone check 2. 
 [Daz:] Chiggie check. 
 [Dr. Dre:] Microphone check 3. 
 [Snoop Dogg:] You turned the sounds of the D R E. 
 Dr. Dre: 
 Now check me out, it's back to the old school 
 Where the niggas get their strap on, don't nobody cap on 
 Slap on some D R E 
 Or some funky ass shit by the D O double G Y D O double G 
 Real G's who drop K's, protect These N U T S so nigga please 
 Peep out my manuscript 
 You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit. 
 "Bitch!" So recognize game from the gangsta 
 Things will remain the same until I change 'em. 
 Snoop Dogg: 
 It's real easy to see 
 So you can check sounds from Nate D O double G. 
 Nate Dogg: 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the muthafuckin' street 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the muthafuckin' street 
 I can't be faded 
 I'm a nigga from the muthafuckin' street

 You picked the wrong muthafuckin' day 
 Here we go, toe to toe, flow for flow 
 Let me know if you think you can fade Death Row
