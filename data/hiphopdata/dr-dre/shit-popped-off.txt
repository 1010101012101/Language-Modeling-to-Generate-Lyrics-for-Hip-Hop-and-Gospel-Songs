Ay, 
 See a party ain't a party till the Doc walk in it 
 The party get it started till I hopped up in it 
 Then it, got so crunk one minute 
 Say she didn't get to witness just listen 
 I came in high, then I saw 
 As soon as I arrived, then the shit popped off 
 Shit popped off, its officially a gangsta party 
 Looked at me then she came to party 
 Then the shit popped off, shit popped off 
 Shit popped off, said the shit popped off 
 Nigga's hands in the air, bitches take their tops off 
 Put the chronic in the air, then the shit popped off 
 Shit popped off 
 (Verse One- Dr. Dre) 
 Late California night, out chillin' I'm, 
 Bout to fall up in the club we just killin' time 
 Dro blowin' on patrone with it in a lime 
 6-4 to the front door with top down 
 Hit the switches and the ignition then hopped out 
 Crew walked in, shut the whole block down 
 Now, hit the door like god damn 
 Hey is this a party ain't it man I don't understand 
 Why bitches over here, and niggas over there 
 The atmosphere so square, people so scared 
 To get up off the wall, and get up off they ass 
 To walk up on a broad, and get up on that ass 
 I commandeer the turntable, that's my first mission 
 Because the DJ ain't spinnin he bullshittin 
 Go from California love and the doggystyle 
 Brought out the whole album, it's a party now 
 See a party ain't a party till the Doc walk in it 
 The party get it started till I hopped up in it 
 Then it, got so crunk one minute 
 Say she didn't get to witness just listen 
 I came in high, then I saw 
 As soon as I arrived, then the shit popped off 
 Shit popped off, its officially a gangsta party 
 Looked at me then she came to party 
 Then the shit popped off, shit popped off 
 Shit popped off, said the shit popped off 
 Nigga's hands in the air, bitches take their tops off 
 Put the chronic in the air, then the shit popped off 
 Shit popped off 
 (Verse 2- T.I.) 
 At the crib in L.A. when the phone ring 
 Pick it up, it was dr. dre saying 'it's on king' 
 I was on henn, she was on lean 
 She was on gin, they all on the bean 
 Broads talkin' loud, and all talkin' bout 
 'We tired sittin' in the house, when we going out?' 
 'Ay shut the fuck up for a second, where you at dre? 
 Text the address to me and I'll be on the the way' 
 Make my way to the closet just for a second 
 Prepare myself to step into the party for a second 
 Check it, akoo hoody, blue denim, gray fitted cap 
 Louis rag, hit the stash, grab any stack 
 I tell a bitch come on, get in the maybach 
 57-s headed straight to where dre at 
 We pulled up to the spot lookin' like whoa 
 Line wrapped around the corner to the light pole 
 Latin chicks, black broads, couple white hoes 
 Who knows where the night might go, hit the doe 
 Like yeah, blinded by the glare of the strobe light 
 See something I like it's going down on sight 
 See a party ain't a party till the Doc walk in it 
 The party get it started till I hopped up in it 
 Then it, got so crunk one minute 
 Say she didn't get to witness just listen 
 I came in high, then I saw 
 As soon as I arrived, then the shit popped off 
 Shit popped off, its officially a gangsta party 
 Looked at me then she came to party 
 Then the shit popped off, shit popped off 
 Shit popped off, said the shit popped off 
 Nigga's hands in the air, bitches take their tops off 
 Put the chronic in the air, then the shit popped off 
 Shit popped off
