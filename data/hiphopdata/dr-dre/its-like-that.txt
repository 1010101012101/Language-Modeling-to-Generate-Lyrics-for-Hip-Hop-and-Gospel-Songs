Yeah... Aftermath... D.R.E 
 It ain't too much I haven't seen 
 Touched or been through 
 Always on the move so I'm sorry if I offend you 
 But I got million dollar deals to attend to 
 Time is money, and I don't have a second to lend you 
 I am the one, with the empire to run 
 West Coast messiah, best known for fire 
 Throw up your sets loc, the chronic smoke retired 
 No more low riders and golden spokes on tires? 
 STOP 
 I just had the Detox 
 Now I'm back on the block, like classic Reeboks 
 As the beat knocks, you can put it in the air 
 Couple of my artists beefin' but I wouldn't interfere 
 My style is innovation, trials and tribulations 
 You can't rush perfection, so thanks for your patience 
 Got on my troops, assembled in groups 
 Ready to shoot, dressed in bulletproof khaki suits like that... 
 It's like that, these cats are sick without me 
 When you need the medicine who they tell you to go see? 
 Never seen all you lookin' so lonely 
 But the Doc's office is open, prescribin' you what you need 
 Got my patients out there waitin', the line is out the door 
 (Got my patients out, door) 
 Here's a dose of, what you folks have been out there lookin' for... 
 (Oh, Oh, it's like that) 
 It ain't another nigga that can play how I play 
 Who else can take a longer hiatus than Sade 
 Come back and blow the scene up, sorta like Bombay 
 You on the road to success, but you're goin' the wrong way 
 What up mo! I'm California's own, homegrown 
 Light up a zone, and smoke out, till your brains blown 
 Me and Nate Dogg, on the same song 
 Now that's something you can definitely bank on 
 Tell me how you seen a producer that's meaner 
 With beats I'm a beast, like Toto Riina, I had my fair share of, courtroom subpoenas 
 Now, I'm tryin' to live my life a little bit cleaner 
 Change is what I had to do 
 I used to be a ruthless nigga with a attitude 
 Made a lotta doe, then got senses to life on death row 
 I won my appeal, and drove off on three wheels, like that... 
 It's like that, these cats are sick without me 
 When you need the medicine who they tell you to go see? 
 Never seen all you lookin' so lonely 
 But the Doc's office is open, prescribin' you what you need 
 Got my patients out there waitin', the line is out the door 
 (Got my patients out, door) 
 Here's a dose of, what you folks have been out there lookin' for... 
 (Oh, Oh, it's like that)

 (Oh, Oh, it's like that) 
 Compton's full of armed thieves and G's that'll do ya 
 So please don't let the palm trees and cool breeze fool ya 
 Ya heard it first here, I've birthed the careers of almost 
 Every hot rapper in the past 20 years 
 You would think dudes happily, would name a school after me 
 But instead they see me at events, and start attackin' me 
 But my faculty, is standin' right in back of me 
 You must like sippin' food through a straw like a Daiquiri 
 Come on, man... who you pretendin' to touch 
 When the shit goes down, I don't gotta do much 
 Buck, poke a hole in him, like a stem in a dutch 
 We ain't tough nah... we just defendin' what's us 
 I got a lot to lose, the drop-tops, yachts and jewels 
 That's why I spot the fool, tryin' to stop my moves 
 I'm not takin' losses, I hang with bosses 
 That can buy anything, like fuck what the cost is 
 It's like that... 
 It's like that, these cats are sick without me 
 When you need the medicine who they tell you to go see? 
 Never seen all you lookin' so lonely 
 But the Doc's office is open, prescribin' you what you need
