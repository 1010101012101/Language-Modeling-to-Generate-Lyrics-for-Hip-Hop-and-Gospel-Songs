(Dr Dre) 
 My life is like a highlight reel 
 Some might conisder this my twilight but depending how I might feel 
 I might continue on with my career for 5 light years 
 Critics can fly kites here? 
 Welcome to my nightmare 
 Pressures on, blood pressure racing 
 I calculate my next step, pacin' 
 Don't know if I'll meet expectations 
 All I know is the World better get set 
 Dre's in effect 
 Been in it since you had cassette decks taping 
 I'm? 
 (Eminem - Hook) 
 Into the wee hours all night 
 And we don't stop until the sunlight 
 We just keep going 'cause the die hard won't go down without a fight

 (Dr Dre) 
 It's on, blood pressure racing 
 I calculate my next step which is to accept my expectations 
 It's sorta too high to meet, my reputations in jep' 
 Yep, face it, the fans they've been upset yet patient, I love 'em for that
