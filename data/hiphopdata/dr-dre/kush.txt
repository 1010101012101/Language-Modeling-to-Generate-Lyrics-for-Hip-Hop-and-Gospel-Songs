Hold up, wait a minute 
 Let me put some kush up in it 
 Roll up, wait a minute 
 Let me put some kush up in it 
 Roll up, wait a minute 
 Let me put some kush up in it 
 Roll up, wait a minute 
 Let me put some kush up in it 
 Now it's that puff puff pass shit 
 Cheech and chong grass shit 
 Blunts to the head, kush spillin' no mattress 
 Speed boat traffic, bitches automatic 
 Cross that line, fuck around and get yo' ass kicked 
 We roll shit that burn slow as fucking molasses 
 Probably won't pass it, smoke it till the last hit 
 Down to the ashes, Mary J. a bad bitch 
 Andr√© 3001, another classic 
 Go ahead ask 'em bitches 'bout how I be smokin' out 
 Party all night, yeah it's goin' down 
 Order rounds, we smokin' quarter pounds of that good stuff 
 Oh yeah, we smokin' all night 
 Yeah puff puff pass that shit right here 
 Nigga, better than my last batch, caramel complexion and her ass black 
 Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale 
 I know you tryna get high 
 Type of shit that have ya leaning sideways 
 Take a whiff of this suicide 
 Holla at me 'cause I got it all day 
 No need to fly to Jamaica 
 For the ganja, we can get the same thing 
 You want that bom bom diggy, holla at my nigga right here with me 
 Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale 
 Hold up, wait a minute 
 Let me put some beats up in it 
 Hold up, wait a minute 
 Let me put some beats up in it 
 Still I am 
 Tighter than the pants on will.i.am 
 Backthrow, back still, I have a pound in my backpack 
 Next to where the swishas at, smokin' presidential 
 Got some bubba, I give me that 
 Need it for my cataracts 
 Four hoes, and I'm the pimp, in my Cadillac 
 You can tell them Cali back 
 Matter of fact, they a know, this ain't Dro 
 Get a whiff of that 
 No it ain't no seeds in my sack 
 You ain't never gottta ask dawg 
 What he smokin' on? 
 Shit kush till my mind gone 
 What you think I'm on 
 Eyes low, mind blown 
 High as a muthafucka, ain't no question 'bout it 
 Niggas say smoke me out, yeah I really doubt it 
 I'm Bob Marley reincarnated, so faded 
 So if you want it 
 You know yo' nigga homie, 
 You can put it in a zag or a blunt and get loaded 
 Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale 
 I know you tryna get high 
 Type of shit that have ya leaning sideways 
 Take a whiff of this suicide 
 Holla at me 'cause I got it all day 
 No need to fly to Jamaica 
 For the ganja, we can get the same thing 
 You want that bom bom diggy, holla at my nigga right here he's with me 
 Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale 
 We get that kush, we blow on the best smoke 
 Inhale slow, no choke 
 Make yo' ass choke 
 Hold up wait a minute 
 You can go put it back 
 'Cause what you got in yo' sack boy, it ain't that 
 Ain't that kush, we blow on the best smoke 
 Inhale slow, no choke 
 Make yo' ass choke 
 (Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale)
