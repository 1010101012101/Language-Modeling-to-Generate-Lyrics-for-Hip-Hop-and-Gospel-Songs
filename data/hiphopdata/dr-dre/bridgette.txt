There once was this girl I knew named Bridgette 
 She asked me was my dick a grown man or a midget 
 Of course I had to show her all my balls ring ding a ling 
 I whipped out my whopper but we wasn't at Burger King 
 Nothing more said she grabbed it like a vice grip 
 And asked the DOC do you mind if I nibble this 
 No, I took her to the back of the studio 
 And, she ate up on the doc like a cheerio 
 I told the bitch yo please don't bite me 
 Then she made me scream when she grabbed the balls tightly 
 So I slapped the bitch for goin' out like a sucker 
 My dick was in her mouth so she bit the mother fucker 
 To make her stop I pulled up on her extensions 
 And I left Jimmy standing at attention 
 The look on my eyes told the bitch she was a goner 
 Now I look back on the day I should have peed on her 
 (Bridgette) Was a girl that I knew but 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 (Bridgette) was a girl that I screwed but, 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 So you know bridgette called me the next day 
 Just to apologize so I said ok 
 She claims she wants to make it up to the DOC 
 And you know I'm still out to get the pussy 
 Tried to be nice 'cause I didn't wanna diss her 
 Passed Mickie Dees and went to the Sizzler 
 Ordered the food, she started rubbin my knee 
 Then I could tell that she wanted to fuck me 
 She said Lets skip dinner and I had a fit 
 At ten dollars a plate I said fuck that shit 
 That's the whole reason our relationship was stormy 
 Why 'cause Bridgette was too fuckin' horny 
 She said please excuse me for a minute 
 To powder my nose I said ya I'm with it 
 She took a long time the food came and I'm chewin 
 Thinkin' to myself what the fuck is she doin'? 
 Went to look for her and I heard alot of screamin 
 Looked in a room and the waiters were teamin 
 Up on the bitch like it ain't no thang 
 But I flipped 'cause it was Bridgette gettin' gang-banged 
 (Bridgette) Was a girl that I knew but 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 (Bridgette) was a girl that I screwed but, 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too 'cause 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 (Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if I were you 'cause yo 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 So you know Bridgette called me the next day 
 Just to apologize so I said ok 
 She says she wants to come over and see me 
 And do any thing to fuck the DOC 
 She said she loves me but I didn't say I love her 
 Went to the store and bought me some rubbers 
 Then I made a phone call up to the guys 
 Boy this bitch is in for a big surprise 
 When she came in I put on a stone record 
 Said a few lines and the bitch got naked 
 Later on the bed I told her to suck my dick 
 And ran Easy, Cube, and Dre, ran out the closet 
 Turned her ass over laid the ho on her back 
 Then we rode the bitch like a mother fuckin' Amtrak 
 Dre had the back and Easy had the front 
 I'm behind Ice Cube 'cause that's where the line started 
 Bitch gettin' dogged bye the DOC and NWA 
 Dogged the bitch out in each in every way 
 That's what I thought but with a girl like Bridgette 
 The dumb ass ho she liked the shit 
 (Bridgette) Was a girl that I knew but 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 (Bridgette) was a girl that I screwed but, 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too 'cause 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho) 
 (Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if I were you 'cause yo 
 (Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
