Money, power, and respect 
 Keep my foes in check and 
 Kill every motherfucker that be after my neck 
 Let's get it straight it dawg 
 I'm hot, ur not 
 I take ur bitch ass and drop it like it hot 
 Ur style is messed up and ur flow is wack 
 The way you be rappin', u must be on crack 
 Goin' against me dawg 
 Ur ass must be crazy 
 'Cause I lay ur ass to sleep 
 And then roca bye baby 
 Ur just an amateur but 
 Me, I'm a veteran 
 After I'm done with u 
 U goin' need an ambulance 
 Now let me stop 
 Take a breath before I really get pissed 
 On second thought, fuck it I'm already pissed 
 Hey yo, this is a lyrical assault on 
 Anyone who wants some 
 I knock you out with one verse 
 Like I'm mike Tyson 
 I'm like a reptile, homie 
 When I spit, its venom 
 First, I cripple ur ass 
 Then I go get em' 
 U don't want it with me, 
 Trust me when I say so 
 When I come around bitch 
 Ur ass better lay low 
 U walkin' with ur bitch 
 And I'm like hold up shorty 
 Look at the way ur man looks 
 He must be homophobic 
 Then after a minute or so 
 She turns at me and 
 What does she say, 
 Damn ur right, he really does look gay 
 And that's when you get dumped 
 Lookin' like a prick 
 While ur bitch is chokin 
 With her mouth on my dick 
 Now you can lean back motherfucker 
 But I ain't fat joe 
 Its dre on the hook and 
 I'm killin' you hoe 
 Now before I go 
 I'm goin' give you this (middle finger) 
 'Cause this ain't no song 
 This a motherfuckin diss
