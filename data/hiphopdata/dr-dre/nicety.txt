Nice and... (James Brown:) ("Nasty! ") 
 (Ho!) ("HEY! ") 
 ("Make it sound good") ("HEY! ") 
 (Verse 1: Michel'le (Dr. Dre)) 
 You know I can never do 
 Things that, you want me to 
 The way I appear to you 
 May not be true to you 
 So don't get your hopes too high 
 And don't be like other guys (Yeah, baby I'm a get you) 
 Assuming that every girl is just like that type 
 (Oh, is that right?) 
 Mennn... 
 (Hey baby, what's your name?) 
 Runnin' the same ol' sayin' 
 (Excuse me, honey, but is your husband married?) 
 (Talking:) No more questions, no more games 
 Some people think I'm nice 
 Some people think I'm nasty 
 But if you really want to know 
 Just ask meeeeeee... 
 And I'll say I'm nicety 
 Hoo-hoo-hoo, say I'm nicety 
 Nice and... ("nasty") ("HEY! ") 
 (Verse 2: Michel'le (Dr. Dre)) 
 You said you would treat me right 
 And I'd never be alone 
 (Talking:) But men'll say anything 
 Just to try to take you home (Yeah, I know that's right) 
 But don't get your hopes too high 
 'Cause I've got to keep it tight 
 And that's the way it will stay 
 Until I feel it's right (Oh, is that right?) 
 Mennn... 
 (Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?) 
 Runnin' the same ol' sayin' 
 (Yo, you comin' over? I PROMISE I won't try anything) 
 (Talking:) No more questions, no more games 
 Some people think I'm nice 
 Some people think I'm nasty 
 But if you really want to know 
 Just ask meeeeeee... 
 And I'll say I'm nicety 
 Hoo-hoo-hoo, say I'm nicety 
 Nicety... 
 It's got to be nicety 
 Hoo-hoo-hoo, say I'm nicety 
 Nicety-eeeeee... 
 You can call me nicety 
 ... 
 Some people think I'm nice 
 Some people think I'm nasty 
 But if you really want to know 
 Just ask MEEEEEEEE... 
 And I'll say I'm - 
 (Dr. Dre:) 
 Nicety, or whatever you wanna call it 
 Ask my opinion and I think that all it is 
 Is just an excuse to givin' the boots 
 For dollar and cents, and remain innocent 
 Dre with the Ruthless Attack, check it 
 'Cause all that you talkin' about ain't Jack! 
 Step off of that, try a new approach 
 You get smoked because I ain't no joke 
 Yeah, yeah... 
 Nice and... ("nasty") ("HEY! ") 
 You can call me nicety 
 Just say I'm nicety 
 You can call me nicety 
 Nicety... 
 Just call me nicety 
 Hoo-hoo-hoo, just call me nicety 
 Nicety...
