 Arabian Prince: 
 Seven days a week, he's on call 
 To get the party people up off the wall 
 You'll fell motivated as he operates 
 'Cause' party energy is what she generates 
 He'll prescribe for you, her potent elixir 
 Two turntables, speakers, and a mixer 
 He'll rock your party wherever you be.

 (Dr. Dre) 
 I'm Dr. Dre, gorgeous hunk of a man 
 Doing tricks on the mix like no others can 
 The nurses say I'm cute, they say I'm fine 
 But you betta beware 'cause' I'll blow your mind 
 I'll take you to my car I'll take you to my home 
 Ans up and down your body my finger will roam 
 The nurses say that I'm nasty they say that I'm mean 
 But when you come to my pad your guaranteed to scream 
 Ahahahaha!
