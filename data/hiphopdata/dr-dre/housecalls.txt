Hello this is Dr. Dre. I'm not in right now 
 But if you leave your name and number at the sound of the beep. 
 I'll be sure to give you a call as soon as I return 
 Hello, Dre, this is Patricia. My husband's out of town 
 And I was wondering, do you make house calls? 
 Ridin' in my car alone not doin' anything 
 Stopped the answering service because I knew my phone would ring 
 Heard it ring once so I picked it up and said hello 
 It's Dr. Dre, baby, not your average gigolo 
 'Cause I make house calls, it's Dr. Dre the maniac 
 House calls, the human aphrodisiac 
 I love those house calls to the girls that's all alone 
 House calls, when your husband's not at home 
 It's a quarter after two, I said I'd show around three 
 Her husband's out of town and she would like some surgery 
 Stopped at the stores so I could get a little wine 
 But all they had was Thunderbird 1979 
 So I left the store, got in my car, drove to her house and then 
 Knocked on the door and heard this sexy voice that said come in 
 Opened the door to see what I got from this house call 
 Tall, dark and lovely, 5 ft 8 in a camisole 
 Now my name is Dre, 6 ft tall with wavy hair 
 The one that comes around when your man just doesn't care 
 So if ya feelin' sexy late at night and you're all alone 
 Just think about the doctor, pick up the telephone
