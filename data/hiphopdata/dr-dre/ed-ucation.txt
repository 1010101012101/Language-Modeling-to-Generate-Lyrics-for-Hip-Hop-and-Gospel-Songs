Eddie Griffin: 
 Uh, they say uh, a black man is a pimp 
 Well let me tell you the biggest pimp, on Planet motherfuckin' Earth is her mama 
 It's her mama that told her, "Get a man that got a good job girl 
 Make sure he got a good car girl 
 Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin' girl 
 What happened to just fallin' in love with a nigga with a bus pass, just 'cause you love the nigga? 
 But I'm the pimp motherfucker, I gotta be the player 
 Biggest hoes on Planet Earth 
 Are walkin' through the motherfuckin' neighborhood 
 You knew when you got with the nigga he already had a woman 
 You knew he already had a family but you fucked him anyway 
 And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga, you went and got pregnant, didn't you bitch, didn't you? 
 The old keep a nigga baby 
 And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child? 
 "Aww that nigga ain't shit, that's why ya daddy ain't here, 'cause that nigga ain't shit." 
 How bout bein' a woman, and tellin' the kid the truth 
 That yo' mama, you was a hoe 
 Tell the kid, "Mama was a hoe, I was weekend pussy 
 I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out 
 That's why he ain't here but he a good nigga 
 'Cause he take care of his real family 
 I was just a dumb bitch, tryna keep a nigga that I wanted"
