Compton was the American dream 
 Sunny California with a palm tree in the front yard, the camper, the boat 
 Temptingly close to the Los Angeles ghetto in the fifties and sixties, it became the black American Dream 
 Open housing paved the way as middle-class blacks flooded into the city 
 Whites don't buy houses in Compton anymore 
 Now with 74% of the population, black power is the fact of life from banks to bowling alleys 
 But the dream that many blacks thought they were buying has turned sour 
 Though the mayor and four out of five city councilmen are black, they have been unable to solve the problems of crime and growing welfare which is slowing turning suburban Compton into an extension of the black inner city 
 Crime is now as high as the ghetto 
 Forty-seven homicides last year gave Compton one of the highest per capita rates in the country 
 Juvenile gang activity, muggings, small robberies make some blacks want to leave
