 Take a little bit of Henessey, and mix it with some syrup 
 Put ya hands up if you crazy enough to get f-cked up in church

 Thank you for bein patient, I got ya application 
 I know you been waitin to see the- 
 Doctor! 
 Here it is, here I am 
 Here it is, here I am 
 Yes, yo ? is right back up in the scene, 
 Yes, my dope is so methamphetamine 
 Yes, it's coke I've laced inside every beat 
 Sh-t, I'm tryna get ya high 
 You been sittin' in the waitin room far too long 
 Too late for- ay, ay, you're far too gone 
 I know you can't take these awful songs 
 Like a punk full of bullsh-t 
 N-gga hell nah 
 They want some real sh-t 
 They want the real 
 Relax, I got you 
 Good thing I had a couple hundred tums layin around 
 N-gga dispenseries, servin' by the pound 
 Back in business, bigger than we ever was 
 It's aftermath n-gga, you know you heard of us 
 We're leavin' narcotics on every note 
 We just struttin the streets, like when the levis broke (?) 
 I got the antidote 
 I got ya hands goin' up and down 
 You done f-cked up now 
 But it's hard to go back to that bullsh-t 
 And whatever's on the bar, Dr is gonna push it 
 (Hook - Sly)

 I'm operatin all night 
 You can be my patient 
 Man I'm tryna f-ck 
 All night

 I beat that boom boom 
 Down like your knees are 
 Legs spread out, like I'm mixin a? 
 S-x contest? 
 There ain't no competitor 
 Looks like it's too late to get ya girl 
 Now, cause now what? 
 Now she's my girl 
 Now you ain't gotta go round no more 
 Fo sho! 
 The doctor's operatin on the flo
