Anderson .Paak: 
 Uh 
 Yeah, check it 
 These old sneakers, faded blue jeans 
 No tricks, no gimmicks, I be stomping down, down, down, down, down demons 
 Rolling up trees in the belly of the beast where the people disagree 
 The upper class hate, middle don't exist 
 The bottom of the beat, glad I got my sticks 
 Are you jumping on a fad? Laying in a ditch 
 I be stomping down demons, stomping down quick, come on 
 And please don't come around these parts 
 And tell me that we all a bunch of animals 
 The only time they wanna turn the cameras on 
 Is when we fuckin' shit up, come on 
 Bullets still ringing, blood on the cement 
 Black folks grieving, headlines reading 
 Tryna pay it no mind, you just living your life 
 Everyone is a witness, everyone got opinions 
 Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes 
 I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight 
 Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes 
 I ain't living in fear but I'm holding him tight 
 Dr. Dre: 
 Damn, why the fuck are they after me? 
 Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard or maybe 'cause of the way my hair grow naturally 
 Still tryna figure out why the fuck I'm full of rage 
 I think I noticed this bullshit right around the fifth grade 
 Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switchblade 
 Nothing but pussy on my mind and some plans of getting paid 
 But I'm a product of the system raised on government aid 
 And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid 
 Just a young black man from Compton wondering who could save us 
 And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us 
 So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis 
 Some of us was unbalanced but some us used our talents, shit 
 Not all of us criminals but cops be yelling, "Stay back nigga" 
 We need a little bit of payback 
 Don't treat me like an animal 'cause all this shit is flammable 
 Don't fuck around 'cause when it's done it's done, fuck you 
 Anderson .Paak: 
 And the old folks tell me it's been going on since back in the day 
 (Tryna tell me man) But that don't make it okay 
 And the white folks tell me all the looting and the shooting's insane 
 (I ain't tryna hear that man) But you don't know our pain (Come on) 
 And please don't come around these parts 
 And tell me that we all a bunch of animals 
 The only time they wanna turn the cameras on 
 Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on 
 Please don't come around these parts 
 And tell me that we all a bunch of animals 
 The only time they wanna turn the cameras on 
 Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on
