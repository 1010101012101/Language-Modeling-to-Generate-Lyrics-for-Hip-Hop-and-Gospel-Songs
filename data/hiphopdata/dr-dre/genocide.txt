Marsha Ambrosius: 
 Stone cold killers in these Compton streets 
 One hand on the nine, all eyes on me 
 Murder, murder 
 Murder, murder 
 Call 911, emergency 
 Hands up in the air for the world to see 
 It's murder, it's murder 
 Murder, murder, murder 
 Candice Pillay: 
 My dada done kill 'em dead 
 Bullet to the dome to the head 
 My daddy done kill a yout' 
 Don't feel a pull a part that man and (let me up) What it look like? 
 See my daddy done kill 'em dead 
 Bullets come down from the air 
 My daddy done killa you 
 Don't feel a pull a part that man and (let me up) What it look? 
 Marsha Ambrosius: 
 Stone cold killers in these Compton streets 
 One hand on the nine, all eyes on me 
 Murder, murder 
 Murder, murder 
 Call 911, emergency 
 Hands up in the air for the world to see 
 It's murder, it's murder 
 Murder, murder, murder 
 Dr. Dre: 
 (It's been a 187 in this bitch) 
 Murder this, murder listen, hit a suburban whippin' 
 Tinted windows ride at your wifey (Blap) and I bet you miss her 
 Reload the protools and we throw the clip in both trays 
 That's one on the left and one in the right hand, Scottie Pippen both ways 
 Been doin' drive-bys, got this music industry timelined 
 Lookin' like Rosecrans when these niggas throw up them signs high 
 I'm talkin' about that bottom where it's high crimes 
 Shit, I'm just tryna get paid and keep 'em thighs high (Thighs high) 
 Sometimes I feel like I could just bury 'em, bury 'em 
 Cause delirium, mass hysteria, scarier area 
 I'm very aware hip hop needed somethin' to carry it 
 So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot 
 Hangin' way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier 
 This is hub city nigga, don't make us embarrass you 
 Man, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic 
 We did the numbers and you lookin' like another statistic 
 Marsha Ambrosius: 
 Stone cold killers in these Compton streets 
 One hand on the nine, all eyes on me 
 Murder, murder 
 It's murder, it's murder 
 Call 911, emergency 
 And hands up in the air for the world to see 
 It's murder, it's murder 
 Murder, murder, murder 
 Kendrick Lamar: 
 (Ah shit) Recognize what lives inside these eyes I'm silent till the dead has risen 
 Live in a project building, dodgin' the module ceilings 
 I ride, I'mma ride in a stolen Jeep 
 Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (corrupted) 
 Mama tried counselin', five plans for Kendrick (but fuck it) 
 My family's ties had sabotaged Rosecrans' existence (abducted) 
 My aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (disgusting) 
 Our stadium's packed, raiders in black 
 Curls drippin', silver bullet, palladium in my strap 
 I lie on the side of a one way street 
 Nowhere to go, death all I can see 
 I say, "Fuck is up?", I fuck 'em up, your supper's up or something's up 
 I hoping all get orthotist, rope it before the double dutch broke 
 Plenty ruckus with the weapon, I protect it under oath 
 My discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life 
 Fuck your hope, fuck your mama 
 Fuck your daddy, fuck your dead homie 
 Fucked the world up when we came up, that's Compton homie 
 Murder, murder 
 Murder 
 Murder 
 It's all murder 
 Murder 
 Murder, murder 
 Murder, murder (It's murder) 
 (It's been a 187 in this bitch)
