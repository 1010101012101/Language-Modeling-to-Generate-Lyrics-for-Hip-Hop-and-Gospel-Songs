Feelin' blue 
 When I'm trying to forget the feelin' that I miss you 
 Feelin' Green 
 When the jelousy swells and it won't go away, 
 In dreams 
 Feelin' yellow 
 And confused inside 
 A little hazy but mellow 
 When I feel your eyes on me 
 Feelin' fine 
 Sublime 
 When that smile of yours creeps into my mind 
 Oh oh 
 Nobody told me it feels so good 
 Nobody said you'd be so beautiful 
 Nobody warned me about your smile 
 You're the light, you're the light, when I close my eyes 
 I'm colourblind 
 You make me colourblind 
 Feelin' red 
 When you spend nights out with your friends and not me instead 
 Feelin' black 
 When I think about all of the things that I feel, I lack 
 Feelin' jaded 
 When it's not gone right 
 All the colours have faded 
 Then I feel your eyes on me 
 Feelin' fine 
 Sublime 
 When that smile of your creeps into my mind 
 Oh 
 Nobody told me it feels so good 
 Nobody said you'd be so beautiful 
 Nobody warned me about your smile 
 You're the light, you're the light, when I close my eyes 
 I'm colourblind 
 You make me colourblind 
 Blinded by the light you shine 
 The colours fade completely 
 Blinded by you every time 
 I feel your smile defeat me 
 I'm colourblind, I just can't deny, this feelin' 
 Nobody told me it feels so good 
 Nobody said you'd be so beautiful 
 Nobody warned me about your smile 
 You're the light, you're the light, when I close my eyes 
 I'm colourblind 
 Nobody told me it feels so good 
 Nobody said you'd be so beautiful 
 Nobody warned me about your smile 
 You're the light, you're the light, when I close my eyes 
 I'm colourblind 
 You're the light, when I close my eyes 
 You make me colourblind 
 You're the light, you're the light, when I close my eyes 
 You make me colourblind
