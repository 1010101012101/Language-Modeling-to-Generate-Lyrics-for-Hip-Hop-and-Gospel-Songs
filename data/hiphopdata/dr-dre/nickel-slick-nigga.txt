The city is a cool breeze day 
 Word takes place in the city of L.A. 
 I'm nine years old to be exact 
 Check the bell bottoms, brown shirt with the dusty ol' cap 
 Goin' to the inn to see my dad 
 And to get some new business 
 Two dollars what a bargain 
 I'm sittin' up the street while I'm humpin' a tune 
 The first time but witness somebody's tryin' ta jack fool 
 The bump director was a also tryin' ta jack a '6-4 
 Brothers tryin' ta tip-toe and yo 
 Pointin' at gauges tryin' ta take a brother's yeah 
 He saw what was up, got out the beat and go and bail 
 He just had to run in my direction 
 But they smoked the players 
 Now he's next to the sports section 
 But the player dropped the yeah on the ground 
 So then I picked it up, run down and around 
 The corner, yo but through a nearby alley 
 Escaped through a tiny gate 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 Huffin' and puffin' but I finally got to the pad 
 My mother axe me where I was I said, "Yo, 
 I was over Snowy's house playin' some marks" 
 She believed what I said so I went to my cars 
 You see I ship bones with my cousin, now he's mentally slow 
 But he was a big ole kid, 6'5â€, 300 pounds or more 
 Nicknamed 'Big Truck', took the shit out my pants around the product 
 Told my cousin we gotta hustle and bustle to make money back 
 I make connections, you watch my back 
 Set up a program, go and live instate 
 But I wasn't sellin' drinks, I was sellin' big bags 
 O' hundreds and quarters of doves, yeah 
 At this time I was gettin' more pud, yo 
 From this car and that car and everybody wanna caught glockin' 
 But me and Truck we was in luck 
 But the spot got hot, police raid, they took Truck to jail 
 But me, I got away, I was nickel slick 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 I was nickel slick 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 Four years past, now I'm thirteen 
 All-meat duster to go undercover 
 My cousin's jail sentence was almost finished 
 Now we packin' the streets in a mix, in it to win it 
 Calling cards, checkin' fools, checkin' names down 
 Now I'm steady (unverified) sent to the ground 
 Other hustlers knew I was doin' my best 
 'Cause I was a bawla young fly player from the West 
 All the pimped up cribs and comeona 
 I'm up on the city so that way I can hit corners 
 Now who would expect this little juvenile delinquent's 
 Straight bawlin' y'all as they kept on bawlin' for it 
 It was a smooth operation you see 
 'Cause I had to your whole entire family lumpy 
 Five years swoop now I'm eighteen 
 I was steadily pimpin' Uncle Sam and foldin' the pimp game 
 At this time I was bust smokin' 5's 
 Hook us up with an eighty cell (unverified) 
 Lei Long was in effect and he said, "Let's do this" 
 Gave it up to eat then I sighed all poopless 
 But Truck was left on the spot, he knew what I'd do 
 Hooked my cousin up with the crib and effect, not 
 The Truck was livin' high, livin' schwell 
 Me, I'm gettin' paid for my mega record sales 
 So there it is, a player comin' up quick 
 I guess I drawn a whole organization of players that are nickel slick 
 I guess I was nickel slick 
 'Cause I was nickel slick 
 I was nickel slick 
 Yo Stan, won't cha price some nickel slick from me 
 Right here, yeah, aha 
 Why don't cha swing it up right here? 
 Ah yeah, wooh, nigga sanctified, ah, right here 
 Yo, I was a player that was nickel slick
