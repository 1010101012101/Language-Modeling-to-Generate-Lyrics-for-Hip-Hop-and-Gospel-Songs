So pump right out my bong 
 Don't leave till the whole bong gone

 All I know if flex and grind, what the flock? I gotta shine 
 I wanna hit it, wanna hit it, got that bitch on my mind 
 Ain't no thin ones over here, you gon get stuck there every time

 No one fuck with money on your hand, you'll be found 
 Adios, enough of all this he say she say 
 I say you go down, you just made your pay 
 All he want is fame, pull him on the poster 
 Playin' with my bred, it gets you burnt by the toaster 
 Grind for the cash, hustle for the hell of it
