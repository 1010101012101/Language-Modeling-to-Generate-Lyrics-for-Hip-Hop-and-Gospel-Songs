U ain't bout that life 
 So everything that growlin' a dollar you see over words, you never turn my back on y'all 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So just because his body full of hatin' tattoos in his face I can tell that 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So you ain't never get it out the streets 
 Dip and dodge the police,.. till I rest in peace 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So just because he robs his liquors, got shot and locked up, I can still tell ya 
 U ain't bout that life 
 He flexin', he flexin' 
 He ain't never flip a brick, flip a pound 
 He don't know how that chopper really kick 
 He ain't never lose a doggy, that pussy nigga innocent 
 He ain't have the wrap it 30 times just to kill the weed scent 
 Them tattoos and that jury don't make you hardest 
 And your coochy rap about it in your car garage 
 You fake as hell, fake as shit, counterfeit 
 You a fraud under pressure, tell quicker than your broad 
 Type to hit your hood with a bodyguard 
 That so not squad, young'uns, they will pull your cars 
 U ain't bout that life 
 I could tell the same nigga on the streets or in jail but 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So everything that growlin' a dollar you see over words, you never turn my back on y'all 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So just because his body full of hatin' tattoos in his face I can tell that 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So you ain't never get it out the streets, dip and dodge the police,.. till I rest in peace 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So just because he robs his liquors, got shot and locked up, I can still tell ya 
 U ain't bout that life 
 Big ball and no bite, big mouth and no fight 
 Flip this motherfucker fo' that bitch fine 
 No matter but he ain't right 
 Earned my G stripes as I'm livin' 
 I'm a robbin' it 
 Hell when Chelsea needs slap automo 
 I'm with your friend Lucas 
 He ain't 'bout that life, he ain't 'bout that life 
 We know the boy gets talkin' 
 200 hundred rounds in your project 
 At that same store barkin' 
 I told what the fuck? They said Diddy is fucked 
 Then all that false clappin', that gang bangin', throwin' the wrong sets up 
 Manicurin' their nails and their toes 
 2020, get his... in his faces 
 I'm 'bout that life, Yodi 
 I'm a thin it like a Tobe 
 The brick squad and the Dante Marv 
 Who the fuck it? 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So everything that growlin' a dollar you see over words, you never turn my back on y'all 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So just because his body full of hatin' tattoos in his face I can tell that 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So you ain't never get it out the streets, dip and doge the police,.. till I rest in peace 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So just because he robs his liquors, got shot and locked up, I can still tell ya 
 U ain't bout that life 
 You ain't 'bout that life, You ain't got no stripes 
 You talked and took but you ain't tryna fight 
 Let this fucker sell it all his life, he's so 
 Aks somebody brought in the hood his whole life 
 Talkin' 'bout you got prize, you work at Popeye's 
 Ain't never sell no work, he was too scared to go outside 
 Get up in that booth and he Tony Montana 
 Ain't got a hundred grand, clamin' you king of Atlanta 
 You ain't 'bout that life, young bitch you got a invention 
 Virgins, don't let 'em fuckin' get you when you're splurgin' 
 You ain't 'bout that life hoe, same signome 
 'Cause I can tell how you talk, it ain't signals 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So everything that growlin' a dollar you see over words, you never turn my back on y'all 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So just because his body full of hatin' tattoos in his face I can tell that 
 U ain't bout that life 
 So you ain't never get it out the streets, dip and doge the police,.. till I rest in peace 
 U ain't bout that life
