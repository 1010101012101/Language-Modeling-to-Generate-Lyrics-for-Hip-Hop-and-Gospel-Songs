For the money and the power 
 Some are sellin', so turned on they fire 
 All for the price of dope, but I bet that won't work 
 For the money and the power 
 We risk it all, lose at life 
 Get locked up, won't learn 
 Come back harder, do that twice 
 For the money and the power 
 The game of life, will I win? 
 Roll the dice, If I lose 
 Blow my ashes to the wind 
 For the money and the power 
 Power of my pen, tell my friends 
 That's it family that this year I'm goin' in 
 If I die tomorrow, go and look over my family 
 Friends' fans can't judge 'bout grands 
 'Bout 2 girls French last year 
 Stressed out, can't help myself 
 So I'll be stacking up grands 
 Waka just stay down, right until the end 
 Ain't nothing I can do, fell who? Not death? 
 But us came to fell, put a brand together, turn it up 
 Then I changed my dream, created a team 
 Locals tryna intervene, uncle Mike's attitude 
 Shorty, I gotta get it by any means 
 God bless me and my enemies 
 Diamonds on my neck and I freeze 
 I stay cool in it, I'm so low key 
 Behind tents are the kites that rince 
 Blow heaven sin on the wild accents 
 G Mack when the money stacked when I actin' magic 
 In the hood not snitchin' 
 Why no police missions 
 The white folks dominated prisons 
 My voice been the hood uplifting 
 My best friend, one way to take him 
 Trade they mamas 
 For the money and the power 
 Some are sellin', so turned on they fire 
 All for the price of dope, but I bet that won't work 
 For the money and the power 
 We risk it all, lose at life 
 Get locked up, won't learn 
 Come back harder, do that twice 
 For the money and the power 
 The game of life, will I win? 
 Roll the dice, If I lose 
 Blow my ashes to the wind 
 For the money and the power 
 Power of my pen, tell my friends 
 That's it family that this year I'm goin' in 
 I was like Waka, why you turned your back on Louie? 
 What a friendship that 
 I was the one that put the hood on the map 
 Yell hard, put the hood on my back 
 Got my spike, that's a known fact 
 Push up once you're here on my back 
 I'm the bull, I'll snatch your flag 
 Dance up without no swag 
 Break now, it ain't about the bag 
 Would Claiko win? 
 Boys charge a plane, chartered the most fab 
 Where farmies at 
 Wish I could bring Kyley Giben back 
 I'm about that, when that deep wet 
 It was my size, never turn your back 
 Never touch the fire, never put up your rack 
 The game of life, will I win? 
 Platinumed up, all on my pen 
 Never would I ever travel again 
 The street life, my friends just they trapped in 
 Robbin' still in traffic and they did it 
 For the money and the power 
 Some are sellin', so turned on they fire 
 All for the price of dope, but I bet that won't work 
 For the money and the power 
 We risk it all, lose at life 
 Get locked up, won't learn 
 Come back harder, do that twice 
 For the money and the power 
 The game of life, will I win? 
 Roll the dice, If I lose 
 Blow my ashes to the wind 
 For the money and the power 
 Power of my pen, tell my friends 
 That's it family that this year I'm goin' in 
 Squad 
 Tell my friends that's the family, that this year I'm goin' in 
 Squad 
 Tell my friends that's the family, that this year I'm goin' in
