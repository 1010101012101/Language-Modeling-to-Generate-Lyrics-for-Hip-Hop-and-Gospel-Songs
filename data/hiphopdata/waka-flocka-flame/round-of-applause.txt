(Intro: Waka Flocka Flame) 
 *Burp* Excuse me 
 Shorty wanna hmmmm 
 All right let's go in the club man 
 Aye bro you got a swish 
 Bro, how many ones you gettin' bro? 
 All right fuck wit me I'll see you in then (uh) 
 (Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame) 
 Round of applause, baby make that ass clap 
 Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap 
 Round of applause, baby make that ass clap 
 Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap 
 Let me see you, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it 
 Baby drop it to the floor and 
 Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bu-bust it, bust it 
 Drop it down and just 
 (Verse 1: Drake) 
 Uh bust it like you can't afford a car, 
 You a star, you look in a mirror you know who you are, right? 
 Cool, take it low, take it way lower than that 
 I fly private when I go, ain't no layover on that 
 Yeah I made it to the top, took a seat still sittin' 
 Man I'm up in stadium in D.C. still tippin', 
 She coulda paid tuition 5 times, still strippin' 
 I just throw a couple bills and she'll have a pair of heels? (oh no) 
 There I go, magic trickin' on yo' ass, throwin' every president except for Nixon on yo' ass 
 Make you rich I feel I should make commission on yo' ass, 
 Wonder what you'd ever do 
 If I went missin' on yo' ass, huh? 
 (Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame) 
 Round of applause, baby make that ass clap 
 Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap 
 Round of applause, baby make that ass clap 
 Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap 
 Let me see you, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it 
 Baby drop it to the floor and 
 Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bu-bust it, bust it 
 Drop it down and just 
 (Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame) 
 Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the twerk team 
 Hair long, ass fat, shawty mean 
 That girl look like Halle Berry when I'm on them beans 
 When I hit the scene girls yellin' and they scream 
 Flocka, can you be my baby daddy? 
 Pimpin' like I'm dolemite, hoes jump in my caddy 
 Smoke like I got Cataract, in the strip club throwin' up them stacks 
 Got racks on top of racks, bust that pussy make that ass clap, clap, clap 
 I ain't done wit you baby bring that ass back 
 Still got 20′s, still got 50′s, even got them 100′s 
 Throw some money, throw some money, imma let it go, 
 Waka Flocka Flame better known as Mr. Let It Go 
 (Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame) 
 Round of applause, baby make that ass clap 
 Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap 
 Round of applause, baby make that ass clap 
 Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap 
 Let me see you, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it 
 Baby drop it to the floor and 
 Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bu-bust it, bust it 
 Drop it down and just 
 (Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame) 
 Bounce that ass, shake that ass like the twerk team 
 Bust it, bust it, like the twerk team 
 Bust it, bust it, like the twerk team 
 Brick Squad Monopoly, shawty that's my home team 
 All the smokers they gangsta green, can't do no G talk 
 I need a classy girl in the bed she ain't gotta be a freak hoe 
 Bust it, bust it, lay down on that floor girl 
 Bust it, bust it, gimme some more head girl 
 (Chorus: Waka Flocka Flame) 
 Round of applause, baby make that ass clap 
 Drop it to the floor, make that ass clap 
 Round of applause, baby make that ass clap

 Let me see you, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it 
 Baby drop it to the floor and 
 Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bu-bust it, bust it 
 Drop it down and just
