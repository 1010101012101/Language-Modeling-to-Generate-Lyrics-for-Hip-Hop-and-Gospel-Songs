They wanna see me dead puttin' prices on my head 
 Spreadin rumors round town like I fell down 
 They can't hold me down they can't stop my shine 
 They can't block my grind shawty its game time 
 Pyru for life breads off the elms nigga ian big on lick 
 Cause ian been to the mother land here I stand grown ass 
 Man gun in my hand ion fear no man FLOCKA!
