 Came around by your front door. 
 But that hot shit, cause you pop shit 
 Runnin' round like you got shit 
 Had my niggas all in your crib 
 You runnin' round like you got bricks 
 Most niggas die 'cause they switch sides 
 And do dumb shit when they get high 
 Cross me, it won't get by 
 Try to play it cool, and you'll get fried.

 Every nigga that's around me get real money and dirt too
