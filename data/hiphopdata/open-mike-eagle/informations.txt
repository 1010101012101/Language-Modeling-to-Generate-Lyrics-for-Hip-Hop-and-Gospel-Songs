I've had the same phone number for a decade 
 And various phone models strapped next to my left leg 
 My first power-up was a flip phone 
 And I could feel the power moving up through my hip bone 
 Yeah, I got a lady and I dance with her 
 I'm happy to see her, but what she feels is my transmitter 
 My antenna span's killin' 
 I'm all full of data like a spiderman villain 
 I'm part flesh and part energy 
 The last text I sent you was from the heart literally 
 Taking flights it gets really really deep 
 I put myself on airplane mode and go to sleep 
 Between my cell phone, router, computer and solar radiation 
 My body's full of information 
 Yeah (I have the power) 
 My body's full of information! 
 And I don't need a lawyer 
 Every time I make a call I get a centimeter taller 
 Yeah, I'm the skies like the white guy 
 Motherfuck your spotify, my mind is an ipod 
 Both of my feets is ipads really 
 And this hand here's an ipad mini 
 And this other hand is an old wired magazine 
 When I pass gas it sounds like a fax machine 
 I be thinking of secret shit then deleting it 
 My mind's on the internet, if I speak it I'm tweeting it 
 A lawsuit, some people want to start one 
 But I got super powers so I'm like no harm done 
 I'm a thousand feet tall, I don't need no litigation 
 My body's full of information 
 Yeah 
 My body's full of information! 
 What's a computer, man? I don't even know what that is 
 I don't even watch tv, what's catfish? 
 Don't know much about science book, never read the atlas 
 My raps run laps around tracks like pistorius 
 Wonder how he finna do the new harlem shake at the wake 
 Two-eighths figure skate on the lake 
 If I fake I'mma jake, if I lie I'mma die 
 I clean up and look fly in a tie 
 If you're lost, I'mma find you 
 Time after time I am the slime, dime after dime 
 Jukebox money dance, dumbbob funnypants 
 Run god, dunny got a gun in the underpants 
 Hit the red grass, do the thunder dance 
 Take a peek under that, run tell shunder that 
 Somebody run me down the basic premise of thundercats 
 It seems somehow relevant to the conversation 
 Kid's so high, he didn't know how to play the playstation 
 Live life on a day to day basis 
 It pays to stay amazingly vaporless 
 Gaze into the ways of stay aper bitch
