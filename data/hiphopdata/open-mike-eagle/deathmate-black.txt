The rejected stone is now the cornerstone 
 It's in the sky in chemtrails from a Dorner drone 
 There's a war between feds and some Jesus 
 The winner ghost-wrote the pledge of allegiance 
 Niggas afraid to touch mason jars 
 There's worse shit on your identification card 
 For any man to ever say another man is irrelevant 
 Is an ant trying to grow a trunk and dance like an elephant 
 So Mister Frankenstein, dead your experiment 
 Body so African and head so American 
 And here's the deed to the motherfuckin' promise land 
 A pound of weed and the pretty lyrics to rock 'em in 
 One whole shattered into dividends 
 They're connected by the rhythm and blood 
 Two extremes of faithful and paranoid 
 But neither ever really saw what it was 
 Every step a man is ever making 
 Was only past playing in another man's original dream 
 And you keep seeing yesterday 'cause it's all gonna happen again 
 Brand new once again, one year later (it's all gonna happen again) 
 Like never before, all over again, one year after (it's all gonna happen again) 
 The rejected stone is now the cornerstone 
 It's in the sky in chemtrails from a Dorner drone 
 Niggas afraid to touch mason jars 
 But there's worse shit on your identification card 
 I couldn't change your life but I wanted to 
 I wanted you to hear nothing else after this 
 The ego is the dirtiest of private parts 
 A spirit boner never sit unless its six feet high 
 I want this shit to do what it doesn't do 
 Disregard other people's choices as if they ain't cool 
 When don't nobody seem to know what to do 
 Except write these words 
 And record these words 
 Memorize these words 
 Till they get on our nerves 
 And we learn to never wait for what we think we deserve 
 Cause the money and the karma is imaginary 
 You don't believe in your arteries and capillaries 
 But they still work 
 Nobody asked you to 
 Nobody not once ever asked you to 
 And they wouldn't till they found a way to benefit 
 One whole shattered into dividends 
 They're connected by the rhythm and blood 
 Two extremes of faithful and paranoid 
 But neither ever really saw what it was 
 Every step a man is ever making 
 Was only past playing in another man's original dream 
 And you keep seeing yesterday 'cause it's all gonna happen again 
 It's all gonna happen again 
 It's all gonna happen again 
 It's all gonna happen again 
 Everyone's still under arrest 
 Even the cops, army 
 I couldn't change your life but I wanted to 
 I wanted you to hear nothing else after this 
 The ego is the dirtiest of private parts 
 A spirit boner never sit unless its six feet high 
 I want this shit to do what it doesn't do 
 Disregard other people's choices as if they ain't cool 
 When don't nobody seem to know what to do 
 Except write these words 
 And record these words 
 Memorize these words 
 Till they get on our nerves 
 And we learn to never wait for what we think we deserve 
 Cause the money and the karma is imaginary 
 You don't believe in your arteries and capillaries 
 But they still work 
 Nobody asked you to 
 Nobody not once ever asked you to 
 And they wouldn't till they found a way to benefit
