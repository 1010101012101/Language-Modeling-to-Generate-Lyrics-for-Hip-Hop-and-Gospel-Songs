 So kid dance ta the track or analyze the rap 
 Before you get trashed-smacked-clapped and that's that

 When I was shooting up doors in Baltimore, try'na score 
 Nappy born hustla, the Hennessey guzala

 Don't make me buck ya, the .9 pound I struck ya 
 '9-6 you ask about this convict 
 Niggaz can't harm this, regardless 
 Niggaz claiming heartless, Easy for me ta tear 
 'Par bitch, you don't want ta start this, I'm lethal 
 Don't make me jump (?) B.Q. we ain comin' see you

 When I see you, I'm leavin' lead in ya liva

 Pushin' rocks on the strip going out, bustin' slugs 
 Pumpin' rocks, do ya thing GOD 
 Whoevers not involved get rid of 'em, finish 'em 
 I'm playing too close, snacks cut throat 
 G-nota wrotes, use intellifent folks ta build blunts 
 Control the .9, steady, ready - blow 
 Let 'em know, don't be mad at me 
 'Cause you ain't as mad as me, you gradually grow hard 
 And tear shit apart, shit I spark from the start, and regulate 
 Takin' your body weight, I leave you critical 
 The .9's pitiful - blowing brains out 
 Even aid they won't el' ver lift the stain out 
 I blowing backs out, niggaz ass out 
 So watch, what you doing 
 In them eyes you be screwing me wit' 
 Fuck around, lay around, make me empty my click 
 Say the non-sense, I got my click on the Do or Die, trip 
 Once I cock it, then I got this, now watch me lock it...

 Leave you wet though, sweep the .44

 Stuck of the hydro, Hennessey rock hard 
 We got this shit lock all 
 My click strike back hard, an that's my word 
 Fuck around and have that ass in the sky 
 Wit' the birds, that's my word

 You don't wanna feel none of these, hollow tips 
 That mack about ta spit, aw shit

 The most Infamous - Scarface - leave ya ass faceless 
 Grip 'em, R.I.P. - but you still right here, wit' me 
 G.O.D. part 3, Gotti on the mission 
 H.A. - V.O.C., the clear vision 
 C.Y. N.I.T.T. - Y. I don't know, But ta do time 
 An tell Killer Bee - Gambino 
 Yo if we don't sell a million, we gonna stick chemical banks 
 Straight up and down - this is how P. think 
 Kicko - long time no see, no doubt wit' outta doubt 
 Money long'll, knock 'em all the way out 
 Rappin' Noyd, jump the negroh out for premises 
 Iller G, my eye-witness, eyes, hes got the dead on, lies 
 A gradual lives a survive, we got diamonds - flooded up plenty 
 Push GOD, civilized GOD - turn of the century shit 
 We can't take it, bless me wit' a high note, baby 
 GOD brothers, Mike Check - crush something kid
