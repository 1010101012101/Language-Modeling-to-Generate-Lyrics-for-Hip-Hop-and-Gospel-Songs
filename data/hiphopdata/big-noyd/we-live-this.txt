 (Havoc) 
 Ready for war, Ready for anything 
 But Doing this for everything 
 Y'all niggers Know my pedegree 
 Fourty first side, blood run through my veins 
 Got everything in game 
 Like to stock and change 
 Got shorti in the hood on the ankle rockin' my name 
 Words that I spit, It's my brain and pipe game 
 Call me your natural right ring 
 Qb's radaiclas, just doing his thing 
 Aiyo, niggas hate it 
 Even though they try to protray it 
 This money looking good, fuck it you can all hate it 
 Like I'm going to lose sleep, hold life, have beef 
 So you can say what you think about me 
 Yo you niggas like Nas and gun fight your dead roon 
 Pull out the nine and still got hooked on 
 Your no frill skim 
 And on skill team 
 Got you in a combma 
 Angel of your shoulder 
 Aiyo we live this eat, sleep, shit this (x7) 
 We live this, live this, this... 
 (Big Noyd) 
 Aiyo, Aiyo, Aiyo 
 Its alyways Going to be gangster with me 
 Nigga, with Tim's on my feet 
 Either sweats or denim jeans, brand new white tee 
 With my chain swinging; I'm thugged in the streets 
 Think Noyd you think hustling busting the heat 
 Repping Qb borrows surrounded with thugs 
 Who carry coke, crack, bud and they got guns 
 Who want from slums to homes; Trains to the V's 
 The niggas you see in the hood with the G's 
 Where gangstas be and the pistols pop 
 You rub on the mama thighs they panties drop 
 This shit get you hot 
 We ill you not 
 You sick because you love the way we rock 
 Crusing in the Nav with a dime or not 
 Jumping out the Nav copping cheese but eye up the spot 
 You know my two heaters is hot 
 Fending for springing 
 And that goes out to those skimming and laying 
 (Roxanne Shante) 
 Who you know have guity fo's and a dime ass kooci 
 Now thugging and recovering, rocking guns and gucci 
 85' getting paid while them gangsters watch 
 Champiagn pop benzes candy painted drop (bitch) 
 Roxanne Shante Hilary Clinton 
 Lay out the red carpet y'all hoes shut up and listen 
 Mouth close whenever you hear a veteran spittin' 
 Y'all hoes only shine with the legends permisson 
 Bitches ask around why she wait to spit this long 
 You know the queen who came out with the first hit song 
 I showed hoes how to rock furs 
 Glocks in my skirts 
 Dated real killers when they feel I cop them a bird 
 Ain't nothing 
 Ain't fronting 
 Shantie love where she lives 
 Mother of my two kids 
 And the mother of the rich 
 Tried to make plans, ran the game and the biz 
 Still real popping up with nas up at the bridge 
 No silcone, No wigs, No liposuchion 
 First bitch riding back sike not fronting 
 I respect new females give all y'all credit 
 Supporting your videos bought all y'all records 
 No matter how you get down you sexual prefence 
 Just keep this shit real or that vet going to set it 
 Queensbrigde projects we murder the rest 
 And all my gangers know I rock the best
