Yeah yeah check it out 
 Now run for your life or you want to get your heat whatever 
 We can die together 
 As long as I send your maggot ass to the essence 
 I don't give a fuck about my presence 
 I'm lost in the blocks of hate and can't wait 
 For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate 
 I'm lethal when I see you there is no sequel 
 Twenty four seven. Mac eleven is my people 
 So why you want to end your little life like this 
 Cause now you bump head wit kids that's lifeless 
 I live by the day only if I survive the last night 
 Damn, right, I ain't trying to fight 
 We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor 
 My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore 
 Ways of action, I grab the gat and 
 Ain't no turning back when I start blasting 
 Pick up the handle and insert the potion 
 Cock the shit back in a calm like motion 
 No signs of anger or fear 'cause you the one in danger 
 Never share your plans wit a stranger, word is born 
 I put the glock on you kid, now I got you 
 You got the heart to get busy without your crew 
 Let's get it on nigga, do what we gotta do 
 You bucking me, I'm bucking right back at you 
 Fuck where you're at kid, it's where you're from 
 'Cause where I'm from, niggaz pack nothin' but the big guns 
 Around my way, niggaz don't got no remorse for out of towners 
 Come through fronting and get stuffed wit the three pounder 
 The loud sounder, ear ringer 
 And I'm a point the finger on all you wannabe gun slingers 
 You got a real ice grill but are you really real 
 Step to the hill and I'm a test your gun skills 
 Cause real niggaz don't try to profile 
 You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwhyle 
 But swing that bullshit this way 
 And I'm a make your visit to the bridge a muthafuking short stay 
 Queensbridge, that's where I'm from 
 The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done 
 Six blocks and you might not make it through 
 What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazing at you 
 Wit macs and tecs to lend to get your dome crush 
 You thought that you could come around my way, you big stupid fuck 
 What the hell you smoking, what the fuck possessed you 
 To come out your face, now I have to wet you 
 Throw on my tims, black mask and black serpent 
 Twist a nigga cap, then jump in the J-30 
 Who's the richest nigga in the project, who got it live 
 Rocking Convertibles, frop tops and mad high 
 Peace to that whiz kid and playas on his team 
 Who's organize, all eyeballs is on CREAM 
 And yyour whole clique got nothin' but raw shit 
 Whip after whip, stay flashing your dick on tricks 
 Your whole crew's ravishing, team's untouchable 
 In the jungle, banging Nas, Mobb Deep and Wu 
 There's money out there, guns catch crumbs, those are your sons 
 Jums is in the mailboxes, bitches holding your guns 
 You know what's out there, thousands of gram, wrapped in saran 
 Sealed tight, keep the freshness, that's how we expand 
 Masked Avenger, drop your gun, son, now surrender 
 Get ninjaed on the island, plus the Bridge, boy remember 
 My little thug's selling drugs and he's struggling 
 The game got him bugging, I tried to tell him slow down cousin 
 But he vexed and niggaz getting wet up in the projects 
 But wit no doubt, shorties out for his respect 
 But is his brain insane from the lye 
 From smoking that one eighteen chiny tye 
 Why, a nigga just died last week 
 As he swore he was growing, he's a thug in the street 
 But it's like that, my crew pump cracks and we pack mac 
 His eyes is wild wit the rezzy monkey on his back 
 But I'm stressed and he need to be blessed 
 Wit a firepack, don't even go there 'cause it ain't like that 
 Slow down baby, he said, what, you trying to play me 
 You must be crazy, pulled out the heat and almost blazed me 
 Then he was Swayze, the shot must of dazed me 
 Thug's selling drug, busting slugs, but he ain't crazy
