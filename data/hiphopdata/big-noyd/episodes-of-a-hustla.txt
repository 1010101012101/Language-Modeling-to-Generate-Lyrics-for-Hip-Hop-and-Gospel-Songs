(Big Noyd) 
 I'm the type of gentleman finessin timbalands 
 Flippin like three grand, cop a hundred grams goin' hand and hand 
 Hennessee guzzlin, just motherfuckin hustlin 
 On the streets watchin police in the gray caprice 
 Six Y trey gate, time to motivate 
 Those are the deeds life will squeeze 
 If you flip you gettin' hit with the four pound 
 Pull out your gat take out more rounds 
 3 against 1, that's how we go down 
 I can't get knocked, they tryin' to get the drop, damn shit is hot 
 I'm watchin what they doin' 'cause they cruisin up the next block 
 I'm hot with this chrome piece, but I don't need the position 
 Where I'm spittin' at the motherfuckin police 
 I couldn't get caught, had to leave New York, couldn't use my passport 
 Bitches hangin' up in the airport 
 So yo bro, got to take the jetta 
 Whateva, I'm on the flow gotta get these ginos, 
 Got a hundred grams of Coke bout to blow, 
 Feel my cold pistol fully start spittin', 
 I'm hittin and wont miss you 
 I'm official, Queensbridge murdera, life gambalin especially 
 Professionally gat handlin 
 Call me V 'cause I'mm vexed like a veteran 
 And better than whoever wanna Front let 'em step up in

 Sittin' back, the blunt steamin, sippin heines and dreamin' 
 Pushin keys in four wheelers, flippin millions to billions 
 My style is extraordinary foul when it come to grams 
 I'm usin' plans takin' out the whole fam 
 You best to believe the trigga squeeze, makin' niggas bleed 
 Cross sea delivery, pushin keys out of factories 
 Baby you sound good, blowin' up in the hood, its logical 
 Matter fact its possible, I got my work bubblin, me and my niggas jugglin 
 Cracks and strugglin while we hustlin but with no question 
 We gonna survive to the fittest 'cause we in this, style corrupt what the fuck 
 Life style like a menace, child livin' for rounds for Queensbridge era 
 I be bringin' terror, the natural born hustla so yeah whateva 
 (Big Noyd) 
 A nigga try to bag me, he grabbed me, a nigga almost had me 
 I pulled out the banga and blew his ass badly, I'm nasty 
 Crazy mentality, start a catastrophe livin' life tragedy 
 You know you gettin' jumped punk 
 There ain't no time for more than one 
 Tellin' 'em son 
 (They front, Smoke his ass like a Philly blunt) 
 Reach for my spine, pull out my nine, cock it one time 
 Make him lay down, don't move around 'cause your ass mine 
 Gave a crook look got him shook, he on the floor flinchin 
 Now we bitchin and he snitchin, listen 
 I pistol whipped him, but to know the main fact 
 Is that I pushed his wig back then took off in the black AC'
