A lot of people ask me since I'm a lyricist in this business 
 How come I haven't gone broke yet? 
 I tell 'em it's 'cause I'm the flyest backpacker ever 
 I'm flyer than Mos Def in a Trump tower surrounded by four chefs 
 Fixing him some slamon croquettes with Kendrick, Cole and Kweli 
 In their dinner clothes, try me, you and your crew will bleed 
 Y'all bums ain't shot for the stars - just New Years Eve 
 Nothing was given to me 
 I had to go upside heads just to get upside hills 
 Never over the hill though, so I never strike when the iron is hot 
 I strike whenever the fuck I feel 
 I eat what the fuck I kill 
 I got this way from not being allowed to eat dinner 
 If you knew how much I've lost, you'd have no problem with me winning 
 How many times, how many times, how many times 
 Could I be reinvented? 
 Money is the deadlier of the five venoms, in my denim 
 Definitively got a widen 'em, garages with cars in 'em 
 Hanging out in bars to have menages with bartendes 
 God was an artist and Jesus was a carpenter 
 They put me together like an easel in the darkness of hell 
 And lost it and left me some loose screws, but 
 These are the nails to your coffin 
 These are the folk tales of a starving artist 
 Battling demons through his notepad like Adam and Eve eating kale in the garden 
 Flying private away from all charges 
 As my layers keep evolving
