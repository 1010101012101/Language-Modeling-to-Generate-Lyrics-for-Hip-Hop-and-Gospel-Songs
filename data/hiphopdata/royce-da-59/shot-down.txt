I wil murder you 
 I don't want to 
 But I will punish you, if I have to 
 I don't fuck with you 
 Cause your vibe is wrong, and it fucks with me 
 I don't play games 
 So you never know, never never know 
 You won't touch a bow till I'm touchin you 
 If I lose control I'll start shooting you 
 Till you like no no no 
 I will murder you 
 I don't want to 
 But U'll start to lose 
 Can't escape you 
 Nigga we can go 
 We can keep it low 
 So everybody else don't have to know 
 Another scrub shot down 
 A scrub shot down 
 Another scrub shot down 
 A scrub shot down 
 Another scrub shot down 
 A scrub shot down 
 Another scrub shot down 
 A scrub shot down 
 You lose, I'll do youuu 
 Take a drink, ah, 
 I can't drain myself and still keep it cool 
 So I keep in mind do it on my own 
 Show up at your home, In the danger zone 
 How many times must I tell you before I finnaly got you 
 You fool, I'll do you 
 I just murdered you, 'cause I wanted to 
 'Cause you had to go, that's just how I move 
 I won't waste no time, I will take your life 
 Nigga take this nine, here is the finish line 
 Another scrub shot down 
 A scrub shot down 
 Another scrub shot down 
 A scrub shot down 
 Another scrub shot down 
 A scrub shot down 
 Another scrub shot down 
 A scrub shot down 
 You lose, I'll do youuu
