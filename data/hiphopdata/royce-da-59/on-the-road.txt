(Interviewer) 
 All right, what would you say is the best part about your career? 
 (Royce - talking) 
 Do what I love doin' all the time, which is, make music 
 The best part about my career is probably being able to 
 The negative side of it 
 Is probably just being away from my family so much 
 One of the many ways I can make money, is to pack up 
 'Cause I find it, like an MC like myself 
 And just, take my show on the road, youknowwhatI'msayin? 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 Tired of the same old hustle 
 Same old niggaz sayin' they is gon' touch you 
 Foes wanna act up when they with back up 
 Niggaz snitchin, niggaz hittin nigga's bitches 
 So I pack up and go - yeah, yeah 
 Me and Vicious in here flickin pictures 
 This shit here is gettin' ridiculous 
 Niggaz gettin' rich and sittin' with them trick bitches 
 Now picture me locked up for life for 
 Niggaz askin what I'm in they light for 
 The nigga who controllin the drop in the price or 
 Like I ain't got an army behind me to fight for me 
 Niggaz money gettin' glowed, niggaz gonna get 'bows 
 And they gonna get sold, on the road 
 Cause at home they denyin to feel me 
 Labels wishin that they signed with the real me 
 That I am on, is dyin' to kill me 
 Cause now that I rhyme with the feeling 
 But I am a soldier, as I'm gettin' older 
 I'm takin' my show on the road 
 (Chorus: Royce) 
 You can find me, up in a quiet, town 
 Like Ohio, tyin it down (on the road) 
 It's nothin', the pump on the block where you come from 
 Cop and re-up and whyle (on the road) 
 Like a show you, go and come back with, dough 
 That's how shit goes (on the road) 
 And it's nothin' to cop or re-up where you come from 
 It's how shit goes (on the road) 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 Yeah, yeah 
 I'ma give it to you till you leakin 
 The problem with me is that I speak with the nine-millimeter 
 The problem with me is that I ain't equal 
 Prove it to you, pull you a line out of people 
 Because I am the sequel 
 That movie you starrin' in is rated R 
 Ridin' through the Chi or the D or the D.C 
 But I'ma be triumphant at least speakin' 
 Lookin' at the south region, thinkin' about, am I greedy? (nah) 
 Movin fifty pounds weekly 
 Ridin' in Tennessee (yeah) 
 If I ain't, I don't eat inspired by Hennessy 
 Fuck around and meet me 
 Shuttin down everything from Uptown to up and down Beat Street 
 But I am a soldier, you know what I'm about 
 In the drop, I don't slow, when I go, on the road 
 Y'knowmsayin? 
 (Royce - talking) 
 And, all types of crazy shit, y'knowmsayin? 
 Like I, I see hip-hop goin' forward 
 Y'know you got, people buyin into, basketball teams 
 So, I see a lot of people 
 Being able to provide for they families 
 A lot of, Black people who would otherwise be out of work, havin' jobs 
 I just see everything movin forward... {*echoes*}
