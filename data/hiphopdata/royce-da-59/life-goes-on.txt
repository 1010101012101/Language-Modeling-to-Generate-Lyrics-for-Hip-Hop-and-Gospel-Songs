(Royce Da 5'9") 
 Yo Ivy, let me know when we rollin' 
 We rollin'? Aight... 
 I mean, I been through a lot man 
 Tommy Boy thing, the bootleggers 
 You know, life goes on, so what? 
 You gotta reach deep down in your heart, and pull out as much as you can 
 To get through what you goin' through 
 I'm livin' proof... 
 Way down DEEP in the heart of a man who was DEEP 
 In the palm of the hands of the truer streets 
 Lives a - nigga who gives a, lyrical nigga the shivers 
 Step up and get hit cause him or his fifth'll deliver 
 His mouth is a gun, the cannibal speaks 
 You need to do more than floss the hand or the teeth 
 And shame on it - only thing that pops out 
 Whenever your glock's out is a stick, and a flag with "Bang!" on it 
 His flow's out-grown his dreams 
 Out of a count that he beams out-of-towners and hold down home 
 You niggaz showin up, with a lot of the same soldiers 
 I'm rollin' up, pushin her outta your Range Rover 
 You decided to be a rider but why, would you do it 
 When you know you could light up my saliva like lighter fluid 
 Soak with writin; cause 5-9 is back 
 And he's about to spit thunder and shit lightning! 
 (Chorus: Royce Da 5'9") 
 "Life goes on.." 
 Uh-huh, you thought I was done didn't ya? 
 "The world keeps turning and liiiife gooooes on.." 
 Thought I would run didn't ya? No no 
 "Life goes on.." 
 Never again will I, need a return 
 "The world keeps turning and.." 
 (And I will never leave these streets again) 
 "Life goes on.." 
 Uh-huh, you thought I was done didn't ya? 
 "The world keeps turning and liiiife gooooes on.." 
 Thought I would run didn't ya? No no 
 "Life goes on.." 
 Long as I live, I'ma continue to burn 
 "The world keeps turning and...
