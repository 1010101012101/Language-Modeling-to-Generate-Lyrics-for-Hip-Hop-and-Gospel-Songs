(Intro - Royce Da 5'9 
 ) 
 Nickel. Tell 'em what it is 
 This is a world - Premiere 
 (Verse 1 - Royce) 
 Look, I'm in a zone for rilla 
 In a freezer with Medusa 
 I'm fucking a stone-cold killer 
 You bitch-fobbing, I'm insiding, 
 I tell Your kids this. Daddy's been doing more 
 Dick-riding than Carrie Wington 
 I'm very venomous, you very innocent and 
 I will send a monster to your house! 
 Call him Harry Henderson 
 Oh my God, I was just in jail 
 Then the devil caught pneumonia, and it made me sick as hell 
 You niggas counting me out can get the riches still 
 You're all in the Matrix, should've picked a different pill 
 You about to see how far that Paul Rosenberg'll go 
 The height of my game is like a DeMar (De) Rozen verticle 
 No one understands me, only one sicker than me is Em 
 I'm into DMC, runs in the family 
 (Interlude - Haters) 
 Why that nigga gotta bring Em name up all the time? 
 Man, You wouldn't even be rich without that nigga! 
 Shut up faggot! 
 (Hook - Royce) 
 I come to embarrass y'all rappers 
 I should run a marathon backwards so I could 
 See what 2nd place look like 
 "Too many sick niggas nickel bring the remedy" 
 (Make it real clear) 
 I come to embarrass y'all rappers 
 I should run a marathon backwards so I could 
 See what 2nd place look like 
 "You not ready for the raw deal 
 It's all real, kiss the ring, be gone" 
 I'm the magnificent 
 With the sensational style 
 My wedding with the streets got the cake but no vows 
 I'm arrogant as fuck; who cares? 
 You suck! Rappers talking about "We the best" 
 Have been to Paris too much... 
 Who hot? who sick, shit, I'm like a Thera-Flu slush 
 Y'all ain't fly, y'all fallin' slow with the parachute up, up 
 I'm a face-slapper, niggas sleeping on an outfit 
 Call us "Tailor Gang" except we Wake 'n' Bake rappers 
 Slaughter Yelawolf, responsible for haters' actions 
 Y'all on Gilligan's Island: find a greater Captain 
 Haha! victory laugh. Even my photographer's happy 
 Picture me mad... I feel well, ya bitch suck my dick 
 I nutted on the floor and let her stand there 
 Crying over spilled milk (sob)

 "You not ready for the raw deal

 My swing's like chains on a playground 
 I bust fly plus I'm about to put some wings on a Greyhound 
 My theory is you lie and drink beer 
 I ain't hearing you so you must be from Liberia 
 I wave by like Hitler 
 100-round thumper bullet-proof what? 
 You gonna need an underground bunker 
 I aim where you should go 
 I put my whole life on the net, even my weapons 
 I am Bazooka Joe 
 We the shit, nigga eat a dick 
 We'll make 'em eat his words 
 We the stones, he the sticks 
 I'm going yelling "Shady" everywhere 
 Smacking these bitches with they lipstick 
 And the baby with the Teddy Bear 
 To you and your man: ain't gonna be no 
 "Taladega Night" I come to crush on y'all 
 And y'all don't know what to do with your hands 
 Nickle-Preme, killing team 
 Add a different dealer every day like a fickle fiend
