I have tried in vein 
 Never had success 
 So it seems my life is nothing but a mess 
 I have lost, my only friends 
 Now it seems I have to start again 
 Merry go round 
 My life's been goin' around 'n' round since ninety five 
 Went from goin' somewhere about to die 
 Went from callin' my chick a chicken 
 'Cause she look like she got poultry around her thighs 
 To callin' your piece a chicken 
 'Cause she got no teeth and she got crow feet around her eyes 
 How hard are y'all? I got a heart the size of Arkansas 
 Count to five, these birds gon' hit the ground 
 And they ain't from out the Sky 
 Went from havin' an outta-this-world-flow, 
 To doin' the video, doin' the coon dance 
 To watchin' my good friend Eminem winnin' a moonman 
 I remember 'cause I was in New York with all of my boys to start shit 
 Lettin' 'em stay with me, long story short, 
 They tore up my corporate apartment 
 Went from bein a kid addicted to basketball 
 To bein' an ignorent nigga addicted to alcohol 
 Round and round we go is how this movie would end 
 Self-proclaimed King of my city, 
 Not really just truly the King of losin' a friend 
 Who would've thought this goof 
 In the park who's true to his ark would lose 
 Or win just by givin' his thoughts 'n' views 
 You would hear that Ryan's skilled 
 Might even hear Ryan kills 
 You will never hear Ryan steals 
 Here to put the "I" in ill 
 My mind is still 
 Like a merry-go-round spill 
 Like leavin' only guns to my kids when I'm killed 
 I got an iron will 
 Intellect as ion I don' went from high on pills 
 To triumph, to hidin' from bills, to buyin' buildin's 
 Then I went from writin' for Dre 
 To wonderin' if my head was on straight on the sidelines 
 Feelin' I forgot about listenin' to "Forgot About Dre" 
 From there I went to about a bottle a day 
 Tellin' who we know "Get outta my face!" 
 Okay I know what Kino said about Dre 
 I look at Kino to this day like that was a stupid mistake 
 But if it wasn't for him doin' that, what would I be doin' today? 
 If it wasn't for Cassius sayin' that he gonna beat my ass 
 Then me and Em probably wouldn't be laughin' 'bout us gettin' past it 
 If it wasn't for me bein outcasted I woulda never been on the underground 
 Rappin' wit slaughterhouse!
