(Intro - Royce) + (Pharrell) 
 Feel good don't it (Neptunes) 
 Royce 5'9" baby (Royce da 5'9'!) 
 What, what, my girl she's putting it down baby 
 My nigga Tre' Little (Yeah, where you at) 
 (Verse 1 - Royce da 5'9") + (Girl) + (Pharrell *Ad-libs*) 
 It's looking like, it's another summertime, everybody wanna rhyme 
 Long day, short night, ain't nobody done in time 
 I know what you wanna find (Ladies) with a underline 
 Knock ya self out playa, long as it ain't none of mine 
 (Ladies) I know what you want, fellas wit they whips out 
 Don't walk, don't get caught, jealous, wit ya dick out 
 No wonder you in the fog, trying see who come through 
 You only got a mont' or two, to do what you wanna do 
 (Ladies) wear tight shit, I'm tellin' y'all I like this 
 Backyard barbeques, (Ladies) looking eighteen 
 I got about thirty thugs, to get in the hype wit 
 Too cute to eat meat, plate full of baked beans 
 Fellas, we the opposite, gotta give me lots of it 
 Suck the chicken bone, from the bottom to the top of it 
 We don't want the day to end, knowin' we gon' play again 
 And again, and again, and again (Come on, come on, yeah) 
 Doesn't it feel good, to see us make money 
 (Chorus - Kelis) + (*Ad-libs* in background) 
 Feel good, like everything sunny 
 Feel good, to see us taking off 
 If they can take it from us at all 
 Doesn't it feel good to see us war 
 And if you breathing (we transform?) 
 Say la-da-de-da-la-de-da-de-da-de-daa 
 (Verse 2 - Tre' Little) 
 Paper stacks, where they at, come on, enjoy this life 
 Slow down y'all relax, enjoy this life 
 I know it's hard when you ballin' from, obstacles 
 Police, women, haters, it's like impossible 
 Gettin' here for my life, this for all of y'all 
 I came along way dog, this shit is hard to ball 
 Drop ya top, I'm saying, this one's for the hood 
 Put yo guns in yo stash, you don't need 'em today 
 Back to the block, and everything good in the hood 
 Put the ice grills up, you don't need 'em today 
 All you need is icey rims, the games we play 
 Attract women, it feels good, just the games we play 
 They love it dog, thugs still havin' fun y'all 
 Too hot, summertime, why you tryna brawl 
 Feels good dog, roll 'til the wheels fall off 
 Hot Detroit, I'm pretty sure it's hot by y'all 
 (Chorus - Kelis) + (*Ad-libs* in background) 
 (Bridge - Kelis) + (Tre') + (Pharrell) 
 In style, (Without a doubt) (Yo, 5'9") 
 In style, (Without a doubt) (Yeah, come on) 
 In style, (Without a doubt) (Ha, ha, ha, yo, yeah) 
 In style, (Without a doubt) (Neptunes, 5'9") 
 (Verse 3 - Royce da 5'9") + (*Ad-libs* in background) 
 (La-da-de-da-la-de-da-de-da-de-daa) 
 I say my crew won't stop, we won't stop 
 We shake it in the park, right in front of the Rover 
 Piece stay on the lot, thing don't drop 
 We gon' do it everyday, 'til the summer is over 
 Yeah not my type, winter or fall 
 So tell all ya friends let's do it again 
 It's the summertime, so I'ma give you a call 
 And again, and again, and again 
 (Chorus x2 - Kelis) + (*Ad-libs* in background) 
 (Bridge - Tre' Little) + (Pharrell) 
 ... Without a doubt (Nine, elevens) 
 ... Without a doubt (Yo, the hottest it ever get, huh) 
 ... Without a doubt (Can't stop, ice cubes on our wrists) 
 ... Without a doubt (Huh, yeah, come on) 
 La-da-de-da-la-de-da-de-da-de-daa 
 (Royce + Pharrell + Tre' *Ad-lib* until fade)
