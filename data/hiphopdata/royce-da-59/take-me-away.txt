Take me away, from all the pressures of living today and save me I feel so low 
 I don't wanna live, when you appear take my soul, just go, I wanna come go 
 Take me away from all the pressures of living today and save me I feel so low 
 I don't wanna live, when you appear take my soul, just go, I wanna come go 
 I don't wanna live 
 Rather actin' then clappin' 
 Attackin' rappers it happens to happens it happens 
 I wanna (take my own life) 
 Something that goes on inside of my head 
 'Cause I'm only delived till I'm dead 
 (That competes a day) 
 Keep the gun with me cocked humble my squad 
 Nobody knows my number, but god 
 And homie (in a short time) 
 Even a paradise is a heaven the dice is a seven you'll eternally burn 
 Maybe (this is how it goes) 
 I think you need to wake up 
 You only here just to take space up 
 You make it as you break up (and it so real) 
 Doom! 
 If you been to a funeral before you felt the grim reaper in the room 
 ('Cause death comes a day) 
 Yes, you can only guess, which one of you next (which ones goin' be) 
 But (could it be me) 
 Maybe but you don't think about it though till them waitress replaced by daisies 
 Take me away, from all the pressures of living today and save me I feel so low 
 I don't wanna live, when you appear take me soul, just go, I wanna come go 
 Take me away, from all the pressures of living today and save me I feel so low 
 I don't wanna live when you appear take my soul, just go, I wanna come go 
 (Sometimes I wanna cry) 
 Askin myself why? is it the fake niggas collide 
 Real niggas defy, but (it should be the other way) 
 Dog, I feel you, 
 Don't let em' get to you, 
 I love you, and you know who you are (can you tell me the game) 
 I just hope you use your soldiers wisely 
 'Cause likely the truth will come out in the ending (and when is it that time) 
 We break bread reflect back 
 Chill with the lord and wait for the next pack (for more hungry MC's) 
 The new breeze climbin these trees 
 Singin' the deeds, y'all remind me of me, ha ('cause this is your life) 
 Yeah, soul is sellin your whole intelligent mode 
 Is exposed to the devil, yeah (and when you look back) 
 You never get to look back flow a hook back 
 It's over yo he took that, but (he can take me) 
 I'm right here 
 Thought I was chasing a dream, shit I was chasin a nightmare 
 Take me away, from all the pressures of living today and save me I feel so low 
 I don't wanna live, when you appear take my soul, just go, I wanna come go
