Woman: 
 Jerome!, Jerome! 
 Put on that Bobby Womack 
 Man: 
 Naw, Girl I Wanna go way back 
 Check This Out 
 (Teddy Pendergrass' "Turn off the lights" starts) 
 Back In the days when I was young 
 I'm not a kid anymore but somedays 
 I Sit and wish I was A Kid Again 
 Back In the days... 
 Royce Da 5 9 
 Back in the days when I was just a little niggero 
 I looked up to my bigger bro begged if I could kick it 
 So when he when out with girls I could go taggin along naggin 
 If she had a sis I could mack a baby hoodrat 
 Y'all remember way back then when it was 1985 all the way live 
 I think I was about ten 
 One of those happy little niggas singin' the blues 
 That be always tryna bag with the shag and karate shoes 
 Sayin' yo momma black his momma this his momma that 
 Then he'd get mad and wanna scrap we'd stay mad about 
 10 minutes then it's like back on the bike to play Hide and Go Get It 
 With the younger hoes by the bungalos then switch to playin' ding dong ditch 
 When that gets old and too cold to hack it 
 Throw on a bomber jacket 
 You could tell the ballas 'cause they bailed wearin Gazelles 
 If they really had money raised we sportin new K's 
 And all the girls had they turkish link 
 If it broke then they made earrings too 
 Like they meant to do it 
 But sometimes I still sit and reminiese and 
 Think about the years I was raised back in the days 
 (Royce and Others over chorus) (3x) 
 (Royce) 
 And everybody say... 
 (Others) 
 I remember way back when 
 (Variations) 
 (Royce) 
 What? 
 (Others) 
 Back in the days 
 (Royce) 
 When? 
 (Others) 
 Back in the days 
 I'm still back in the days but now the year is 87, 88 that's 
 When my crew and I were in Jr. High in 7th grade I hated school 
 (Wished it had blown up) 
 No doubt I couldn't wait to get out 
 (And be a grown up) 
 But let me finish this reminiscin and tellin' 
 Bout when girls was bailin tight courderoys like 
 For the boys basket weaves, Nike, Cortez, and Footsie Socks 
 And eatin pickles with Toosie Pops and it don't stop 
 I'm glad 'cause when J.J. fad that Supersonic 
 It was kinda like a sport, to wear biker shorts 
 Or, to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses 
 Of hoochies had Poison airbrushed on they asses 
 Dudes had on Nike suits and the Pumas with the fat laces 
 'Cause it was either that or K-Swiss 
 I miss those days and so I pout like a grown jerk 
 Wishin all I had to do now was finish homework 
 Its true you don't real-a-lize really what you got till its gone 
 And I'm not gonna sing anotha sad song 
 But sometimes I do sit and reminisce then 
 Think about the years I was raised 
 Back In The Day 
 (The variations w/ royce and others) (2x) 
 Well, it's the niggero I figga that now I'm all grown up 
 Be'cause I'm 18 years old and guess you could say I'm holdin' down 
 A steady job, true steady mobbin, you steady bobbin your head 
 And I'm paid so I got it made but 
 Didn't always have clout useta live in South 
 Central L.A. that's where I stayed and figured a way out 
 I gave it all I had so for what its worth 
 I went from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first 
 So (??? is on our way up) 
 Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid 
 And we finally did but 
 Sometimes I still sit and reminisce then 
 Think about the years I was raised 
 Back in the days 
 (Chorus With Variations)
