Come away with me. 
 Let's journey to a land where men are men. 
 (Sham on) 
 And I wish that this all was a dream. 
 Those skinny jeans. 
 How do you get your balls in them things? 
 And the day that my son should want a pair. 
 That's gonna be the same day that I put a gun to my head. 
 And why would you want your booty to stick out? 
 Just be glad you're not in jail. 
 (Sham on) 
 You are gay to me. 
 And that's ok to me. 
 But I still hate your pants. 
 You're a fag to me. 
 Long as you're happy, B. 
 But that don't mean I have to like your pants. 
 Where did you buy those things? 
 Are those designer jeans? 
 'Cause I haven't seen them at Saks. 
 (Sham on) 
 And I wish that this all was a dream. 
 You got a crotch like a Ken doll in them jeans. 
 And there's no way I should be able to see the imprint of your knees. 
 And them jeans make you look like you got big feet. 
 And I wish that y'all would quit it with that dance. 
 And I hope y'all go to hell. 
 (Sham on) 
 You are gay to me. 
 And that's ok to me. 
 But I still hate your pants. 
 You're a fag to me. 
 Long as you're happy, B. 
 But that don't mean I have to like your pants.

 Talking Outro: 
 Skinny jeans really gross me out. 
 It's just the whole concept, you know. 
 Pulling them over your hairy man ass. 
 And then, having to peel them off your hairy legs. 
 It's disgusting. 
 Mickey Factz was in the same room with Joey 
 When he got punched in the eye. 
 I blame it on the skinny jeans. 
 I blame it on the skinny jeans 'cause he couldn't react fast enough. 
 'Cause his legs was all caught up in the skinny. 
 I hate skinny jeans.
