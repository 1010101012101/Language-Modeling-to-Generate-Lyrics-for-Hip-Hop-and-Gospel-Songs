Yeah, yeah yeah 
 There's a void that needs to be filled inside this marketplace 
 You could die in my parkin space 
 My mom want me to blow up and house them 
 My father want me to bring product out without Slim 
 And prove them wrong - they paid my bills 
 I'm right on your heels, I'm for real, my shoes is long 
 To feed my son - I will leave you 
 Leakin in the street, I will heat you to kingdom come 
 Uh, the king will come 
 Wait till you gone in place of a angel appear to take you home 
 The beard on the face is gone 
 These bullets is straight razors, blazin' you, case in point 
 Amaze the rap game, make 'em point 
 Walk inside of the house of the illest and case the joint 
 And take whatever I want, out of it 
 Now that I'm wise, my future rides on it, it's time for triumph 
 (Chorus: Royce Da 5'9" + (Ingrid Smalls)) 
 I promise - if you just let me in the game (Pray) 
 If you should bless me enough to let me reign, I will contain you (Pray) 
 I promise - I will support my family, slash you (Pray) 
 I promise - I will pray every day, I will ask you 
 I promise - if you just let me in the game (Pray) 
 If you should bless me enough to let me reign, I will contain you (Pray) 
 I promise - I will stop the killin', I will change (Pray) 
 I promise - I will put in this flow, what you put in my soul 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 The whole misconception with me 
 The only thing people think that I'm arrogant when they don't know me 
 That's what it was 
 If I wasn't a real nigga the shit would not bother me but it does 
 The shit is not fair 
 Just picture yourself lookin' in the mirror tryna change what is not there 
 When niggaz stop speakin' 
 Them phone calls get slow, I'm feelin' like Nas before he dropped "Ether" 
 I appear to be sober 
 I'ma really be runnin' over whoever said that my career was over 
 Whoever gave me the cold shoulder 
 And turn they backs on me, I'll be blazin' you from both coasts 
 Believe me, I got Lil' Homie and July 6 
 So you funny actin' ass producers, I don't need you 
 You can keep yo' beats, rap for money 
 FUCK you and everybody else who acted funny 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 Uh, I'm callin every nigga out in the game 
 That tried to go against the fire and douse the flame 
 I could shout yo' name 
 But nobody stands out more than anybody else, you doubt the same 
 For every nigga that say I'm hidin 
 Just because I ain't hangin' out at the same places I once vibed in 
 Everybody at my father's job askin him rumors, shit 
 Stop as my dad soon gon' quit 
 If I can, maybe thank him for raising me 
 To think like a baby gangsta, crazy temper 
 I paid my sentence - totaled out the prison 
 The game sent me, fame owes my name plus interest 
 But once you strapped in to the penmanship 
 And the track rumbles, you trapped in this rap jungle 
 When you can't come through, sales are numbers 
 The one who prevails'll be the one who remain tumbled 
 (Royce) What you put in my soul... (echoes) 
 (Ingrid Smalls) 
 Pray, pray, pray 
 Pray, pray, pray... (fades out)
