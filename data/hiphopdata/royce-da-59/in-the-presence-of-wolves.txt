(Royce Da 5'9") 
 Yo Tre', you gon' spot me or what? 
 Let the games begin 
 Jah 5'9", where you at? 
 Round one (CHI-CHI GOT THE LLELLO!) 
 Yeah, real niggaz on the prowl, HOO! 
 You's in the presence of wolves, let go your goods 
 I smell your blood in my neck of the woods 
 Fuck around with us and get found on your neck in the woods 
 Give him respect in his hood, don't mess with his crew 
 Niggaz be, salty as pretzels when I'm in the Lex' and it's movin 
 Invadin and steppin in my shoes is a definite intrusion 
 I'm exceptionally cool, never expect to be under pressure 
 Or rescued, definitely only sweat in the BOOTH 
 I'm officially fuckin' you up with, nuttin but wit 
 A blizzard is frozen, hidden under the clothin 
 Listen, you lyrical nothin' you, you touchin who? 
 When it was wrote, you spit it, you thought you ripped it you loved it 
 It's like, the sun is above us when the wrist is uncovered 
 Like, all you gon' spit is blood or kick is the bucket 
 Like 99 percent of you niggaz that rhyme SUCK! 
 This is, the point of no return, I'm stuck 
 (Tre' Little) 
 Yo, yo you fuck-head niggaz ain't makin' gangsta music 
 I make music for gangstas, it's therapeudic 
 You wild out to it, let the guns go too 
 Spittin' out, skeet out, smoke a blunt to it (ERRR!) 
 Fake niggaz don't dare, it's too real 
 Have you doin' drive-bys on my command, NOW KILL! (UHH!) 
 Go on, sniff the chi-chi, rock along with me 
 It goes - guns, murder murder live in Rock City 
 You knowwww - don't let you get beside yourself 
 It's just a, terrible thing to just lose your health 
 Look wrong, don't speak, just lose your wealth 
 That's the truth baby boy - shhh, quiet as kept 
 They games we play, official
