(Intro: Royce) 
 Hit you until you, hit you until you 
 I'ma hit you until you, hit you until you 
 I'ma hit you until you, hit you until you 
 Hit you until you, hit you until you 
 I'ma hit you until you STOP, hit you until you GO! 
 Hit you until you DROP, hit you until you ROLL! 
 I'ma hit you until you BLEED, hit you until you LEAVE! 
 Hit you until you... yeah, yeah 
 I put in my dirt I'ma hurt you 
 (Verse One: Royce Da 5'9") 
 You must be ruthless, or you will die hidin 
 Bullets is +Eeny Meeny Miny Moe+; don't put your foot in my circle 
 I'm not a hater nigga 
 Beside a bunch of chicken niggaz that +Duck Duck Goose+ 
 You punks got a 50/50 chance of livin', you playin' +Rock Paper Scissors+ 
 I got twin glocks from Scotland, I'd rather +Double Dutch+ witcha 
 Why the F**K would I knuckle up witcha? 
 He played them street games till the heat came 
 Same nigga that be changin quick when they see brains 
 We ride in streets with Mafia ties 
 We pop up by surprise like we playin' +Hide-And-Go-Seek+ 
 And I'm about to draw the line nigga, talk to your soldiers 
 Cross me, you try to knock a stick off of my shoulder 
 I'm the nigga +Simon Says+ 
 Nigga I will heat you, 5'9" will have you lyin' beside your bed 
 (Chorus: Royce) 
 I'ma hit you until you STOP, hit you until you GO! 
 Hit you until you DROP, hit you until you ROLL! 
 I'ma hit you until you BLEED, hit you until you LEAVE! 
 Hit you until you, hit you until you 
 I'ma hit you until you STOP, hit you until you GO! 
 Hit you until you DROP, hit you until you ROLL! 
 Hit you until you BLEED, hit you until you LEAVE! 
 Hit you until you. 
 (Verse Two: Royce Da 5'9") 
 Yeah yeah, I see pain but why 
 Is it these street games is all leadin into the same violences? 
 God is it, possible the same niggaz 
 That's winnin' in +Dodgeball+ will grow up and dodge bullets? 
 The funky little, two squares 
 In this concrete jungle was shootin the +Monkeys In The Middle+ 
 If you compare me to anyone in this game 
 If it ain't Shyne or Beans then it's +Truth Or Dare+ 
 I been this hollow inside for years 
 Leave peers beside beers that'll +Spin The Bottle+ 
 Don't think that e'ry night seem right 
 Nigga just look beside you, I'm at every +Red Light, Green Light+ 
 Ready to stop you, fatal-ly 
 I'll leave bullets inside your truck the size of +Hot Potatoes+ 
 A comparison's vital - you ain't nobody 
 Royce 5'9" is Simon, the +Americal Idol+ 
 Yeah, yeah, now he's had the luck as 
 (Verse Three: Royce Da 5'9") 
 At the pick of the day the hot shot, let's play +Hop Scotch+ 
 Let's teach all of these punks 
 The same dumb fuck that took toes to the morgue for +Freeze Tag+ 
 Miss the clock is tickin away 
 That we as venomous as snakes, you can be them +Leap Frogs+ and jump 
 I'ma make 'em all drop and say "Ah" 
 I'm the king of the playground, I make 'em say +Father May I+ 
 You should say Grace - cause even if you 
 Bring your own pencil to the game nigga we don't play +Breaks+ 
 Now you gon' find your fitted 
 Finally the dudes be lame 
 In the Lost and Found cause you crossed your bound nigga +Hide+ and go get it 
 His name booted out of the games, hang by the dooky chains 
 Then flee the scene while runnin' in the latest Ponies 
 Erase the phonies - keep his team shooter 
 (Chorus) - repeat 2X
