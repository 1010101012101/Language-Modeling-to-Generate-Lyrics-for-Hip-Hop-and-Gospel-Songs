Damn! 
 B-E-3

 International rap 
 For the leader of the rat pack 
 Who's back for more 
 Back back back 
 He's equipped with gats 
 And more artillery than what I had before 
 Take explosives 
 Slow act to ask 
 Leave shit stains 
 On the game 
 After I pass womb 
 But I gotta sit 
 In this shit hole 
 Gotta get it 
 All I really need is one 
 (Gunshot) 
 You are about to get into the mind of a psycho 
 Malcolm 
 Looking out of the window with a rifle 
 Other hand on the bible 
 Got a nigga face up 
 Take another motherfuckin' nigga lookin' trifle 
 If he got a trigger then he prolly [probably] gonna pull it 
 Till he runs out 
 Prolly won't sweat 
 'Cause he got 
 Eeny meeny miney mo bullets!

 Hex Murda this one's for you

 Going simmalimma tillamimma simmalimma tillamimma

 It takes one to know one a killer 
 Gunshot (gunshot)

 One less thing you know 
 Know one's iller 
 Po po for the up 
 Piss on your chinchilla 
 Fuck you and your tight pants... (Ah!).. 'nt dance [can't dance] 
 I make (I tac?) fans 
 20 beefs to shit 
 Gonna plead the fifth 
 Standing in front of a hung jury 
 One worry 
 And a bitch ain't that 
 Patron patron 
 Come on come on 
 Drink till I talk to the bottle 
 Royce Da 5 all spent out 
 With the 9 at the end - follows! 
 Damn! 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 Welcome to the Bar Exam 3 
 Fuck you very much 
 We got Eli Porter on the guitar (on the guitar)

 We got Tay Zonday on the keys
