(Chorus: DJ Whoo Kid) 
 I'll be shutting niggas up when I taaalk [scream] 
 But nothings ever gonna get done to me (mee!)

 You don't want no problems, the drama be too horrendous 
 Fuck you and your feelings, you momma the who offended! 
 Pimpin' ain't easy, but bitch I'm in the building 
 I'm the smack man! - I got a back hand like Serena Williams! 
 He hungry like them Africans on the TV asking feed the children 
 Even though he be eating like he Silician! (whooo!) [kids ovation] 
 I sweat brilliance, I shit genius 
 You on fire till I come by you and extinguish! 
 I'm distinguised! - I'm bout to quit writing, 
 You 'bout to grow a set of hooters while a nigga just winging! (whooo!) 
 My dick swinging! - It's slappin' my leg so much the shits stingin' 
 You heard who better than me, bitch bring 'em! 
 Uh! - He stepped up like Rocky, he'll probably be finished (whooo!) 
 He'll go from looking like he Balboa to Rocky Dennis! 
 You thought you was winning till every tooth in your mouth is in 
 A pouch in your pocket, the next time you talk to your dentist! (yeah!) 
 These lame nigga's say they body's is endless 
 Get in my lane they license to kill - is probably suspended, [gunshot] 
 UHHH! - I'm fly! Feeling like I got wings and I'm in the air 
 I miss my flight tell the pilot I said I'll meet you there! (there!) 
 'Cause he too rare! - There should be a sign on every vocal 
 Booth that's says if Nickel-9 - choose to do your beat beware! [echoes] [shot] 
 (Kids ovation)

 Last name (Pay Me) - first name (Fuck you!) 
 You collect and call me by my alias, it's? 
 Find me with your bitch my dick out - with a mouth on it 
 Take her round the corner a couple times - put some miles on it! [scream] 
 Take her round monsters! - OG's that used to be slaves 
 For Reagen helping to fund the Iran contra!

 Crooked is the smart one, 
 But don't you get it twisted that nigga there he will kill ya! - Beanie Si' I ain't hear him! 
 [2 shots] When I brain storm actual rain comes 
 I am - one with the streets, I Sam - Cooks the beat until change comes! (C'MON!) 
 My brain got different compartments, 
 When it holds the ?, when it holds the explosives! 
 One just got a note in it that says on it homie knows that he dope he 
 Stay on his toes he ferocious, he hopeless the focus on me 
 With negative energy! - You'll only lose your focus! - I am not the best, 
 I am death; now let God and Satan iron out the rest! [echoes] 
 Ha-ha-ha! 
 Ha-ha-ha-ha! [kids ovation] 
 That's the victory laugh.
