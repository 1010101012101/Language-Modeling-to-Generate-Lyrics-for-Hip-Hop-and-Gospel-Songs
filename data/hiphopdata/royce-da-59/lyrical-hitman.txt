 This the homicide, sodomy of course 
 Mobb Deep, like I got Havoc and Prodigy support 
 Ima' be dope until the find me as a corpse 
 You can roll your weed up in my Toxicology Report 
 You can call me Kuklinsky, Iceman for short 
 And I got dead rapper's pens in my Icebox 
 After they act hard I lyrically kill em' then I bury their notebooks in my backyard 
 Check it out, the lead gonna hit em' 
 I'm so far from positive 
 Nigga I'm the opposite of Rev Run on Twitter 
 I'm a dead wrong, headstrong spitter 
 Compared to me you a faggot gettin' fed bone nigga 
 I'm picture platinum 
 You a red bone nigga, I'm a trip 
 You a [?], I'm sick 
 You a snitch, that like to sing the Fed's songs nigga 
 Oops, I forgot my meds, you the absent minded 
 When they find ya' body it's gonna be without ya' head

 "It really surprised me it would've took his head off" 
 "That's something I didn't expect"

 This is murder for hire 
 Got word to my supplier 
 Snuck up on em' 
 Strangled em', He never heard the wire 
 These niggas claim they cold, I swear my words are fire 
 Me and you can get it on, I bet that you retire 
 I'm from the city of [?] YDI 
 Cold men, he own guns, this is not A Country for Old Men 
 Boat Guns, sweat socks, don't run, just stop 
 Put the needle in his [?] watch his head pop 
 You little niggas done fizzled out 
 Niggas claim they murderers 
 Ima' show them what this about 
 I am doing work, you can't travel here, pick a different route 
 Gimme twenty beats and I pick em' off as you pick em' out 
 My shit is the [?], I'm clicking this heat 
 Whip up your peeps, whip up ya' beef 
 Duck, spray em' 
 I'm a stuntman by the way I lift ya' Jeep 
 They should throw under the jail for how I'm killin' this beat
