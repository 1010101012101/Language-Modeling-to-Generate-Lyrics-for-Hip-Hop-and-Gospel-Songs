Yeah, I got one problem, that's alcohol, a nigga or a bitch ain't one. 
 Yeah I'm done talkin', I converse with guns sparkin, 
 Chop ya whole crew up and put y'all in one coffin, 
 Pull up in somethin' awesome, 
 Valet should pay to park it, A motherless god made me when he created arson, 
 Keep bussin until they all gone, 
 I'm triple w dot murder, log on, 
 A lot of mouth on these rap niggaz a lot of doubtin, 
 A bunch of lame ass niggaz, soundin like roger troutman, 
 You need to look at my track record I'm spaz happy, 
 I heard a well known fag just took a jab at me, 
 Yeah you already know wat I do to fools, 
 So when I see you I ain't gon be in the music mood, 
 Get you stomped good, 
 Take ya hoe and turn her to overnight celebrity like that nigga that punched shug, 
 Don't gotta thank the player 
 You welcome to Detroit, 
 The city that you can't compare with the gangsta mayor, 
 You wet you ain't the sprayer, fuck wat ya TV's say, 
 Them ain't no real D niggaz snitchin on DEA, 
 The topic of your discussion is my release date, 
 Bottle after bottle I drink till I can't see straight, 
 Niggaz quit askin me questions about Ca$his, 
 As long as he's still signed with my nigga Shady he's straight, 
 I ain't got no problem wit him, but I will promise this, 
 Next nigga throwing my name around imma kill him, 
 I got a lot to spend, spent so much time putting G's on my enemies, I forgot to watch my friends, 
 Thought I was already covered until I found out, 
 My nigga Tre Little was loyal as R.Kelly's brother, 
 They say you talk about rappers whatever you do, 
 I like to talk about pussy like definadu, 
 Getting this shit is fun, Me you don't expect to run, 
 Ain't gotta respect me, just don't disrespect my gun, 
 I came in and dude fled from the boxing match, 
 He ran like a huge head in a stocking cap, 
 You little niggaz keep cool 
 'Cause I eat dudes, 
 When I see you shrimp niggaz all I do Is seafood, 
 Lord, fuck a boss imam God, 
 Parked outside a muthafucka's house ain't a homicide, 
 Them niggaz you got in your car say they down to ride, 
 His tongue cool, but evidently his lamatard, 
 BOP, y'all could doubt me, 
 This long legged clip walking out be the only thing POP about me, 
 Who could stop me? 
 I hit him like I'm Luca brasi, 
 So many bitches on my dick nigga luka jocked me, 
 Who the sickest shit to spit? 
 Is it me or is it trick? 
 Its 'cause you ain't comparing me to any nigga, 
 Any Wayne, any Jigga we can bang, 
 Any figure we can bet, 
 I will slang any nigga you can check, 
 Who the best? 
 Now until any volunteer DJ wanna give me play, 
 Meantime you can sweat, 
 I come to your set, 
 Nigga I don't give a fuck, 
 You raisin brain ass niggaz sound shriveled up, 
 The price you gotta pay, doin' what them dolla's say, 
 Happy Bar Exam 2 bitch, it's a holiday
