(Intro: Royce) 
 Uh-uh uh uh, yeah homeboy 
 Two gangstas, whattup Smut Peddlers? 
 My man Milo, yeah yeah yeah 
 Whattup Ruckus? We gangstas, yeah 
 Niggaz don't know me, call me heat 
 That's all you know is these verses, these names 
 Nigga-nigga-nigga 
 Nickel Nine is - me, not, them 
 This is - him, not, they 
 Royce, Reef, double, R 
 Beef is close but trouble's, far 
 Nickel Nine is what the rhyme is 
 I put my time in, nigga Nickel Nine is 
 Uh uh - me, not, them 
 This is - him, not, they 
 Yo, he is. 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 The reason why the funds is dizzy 
 Money continuously spendin, round and around like a frisbee 
 My runs is sticky from, the second-hand smoke 
 From outta the guns they busy, EHH-EHH-EHH-EHH come get me 
 He is - quick on the draw, same nine 
 That I used when he thought I copped it and popped it at the same time 
 Shit, carry tools, you gotta 
 The streets is over-populated with niggaz who cheap, like Andrew Goulatta 
 Royce and Reef, double R 
 When the gutterest beefs meet with the troubled bar it's nothin' but heat 
 Niggaz I'm in and outta this booth, like Clark Kent for the youth 
 Flyin with the NARC proof tint for the Coupe 
 Niggaz be trippin' a lot, so I keep the longest clip in a lock 
 Hit you while you loadin the clip in the glock 
 Like BLAOW! No life, no breath 
 The only games I play is "Umi Says" like Mos Def (nigga) 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 Over-protected, heed the poet's connections 
 When it goes in effect the only thing froze is the necklace 
 That's it, keep the gat by me, I'm that rowdy 
 So none of you's can see me like Jack Ponty 
 None of you niggaz bad as me, I got a Mo
