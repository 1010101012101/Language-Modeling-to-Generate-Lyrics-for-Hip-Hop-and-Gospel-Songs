Team invasion. 
 Verse One: 
 This ain't 'Ye it's more like Aids 
 This ain't James it's more like a trade 
 And you more like Wade 
 And I ain't playin' 
 I'm more like Cuban 
 Not the cigar, Mark, introduce him 
 "It's the new" - Beastie Boys 
 "Best rapper alive" - Jay-Z [x4] 
 Naw 
 This ain't Wayne 
 It's more like Pain 
 And I ain't talkin' bout with T dash in front 
 I'm more like needed rehab for months 
 Hock and spew lyrics on Dr. Dru's spirit 
 Until he has the mumps 
 Drunk 
 That's if I can put it in one word 
 My niggas that ain't with all the drinkin', they want herb 
 So even though the car plush 
 The ashtray full of dark butts 
 Like we rollin' up lookin' for Yung Berg 
 Top off 
 Bitch in the front 
 Dolein' me up 
 Till my rocks off 
 Either that or she gonna get lock jaw 
 Stop naw 
 If she come up for air 
 I cut her off like Jesse Jackson with a hand on Barack's balls 
 Awe 
 Nigga it's me 
 Jumper movie in the flesh straight from It-aly 
 Five series, six series Benz's 
 Fuck them little C's 
 I'm on some ole Maino shit 
 Throw everything at you but the kitchen sink till I plug you 
 It's goin' down 
 I'm on some ole Draino shit 
 I'm the Rich Po, not so 
 The flow spells gospel 
 Book you for a show and turn your hotel to hos-pital 
 (It's an invasion) 
 This ain't Luda, it's more like shoota 
 Better yet, +Shot Ya+ 
 Pac or Big Poppa? 
 "It's the new" 
 "Best rapper alive" [x4] 
 Verse Two: 
 This ain't Jay 
 It's more like sprayed 
 The kind that confuse kindness with po' like play 
 My bitch got two midgets in the bra 
 And a nose like a vacuum 
 She did a lot of snow like Wade 
 Fuck Forbes 
 Fuck Money till they put some black heads them motherfuckers 
 Like they come from pores 
 Hip hop is alive 
 My nigga come for yours 
 I got the hood open, attached to jumper cords 
 Alone in the mirror 
 Rub a dub dub 
 I ain't the game 
 Even though I don't belong in this era 
 I'm tryin' to take shit past Nas, Jay, Shady and Dre shit 
 Shout out to the Doc 
 I'm tryin' to find patience/patients 
 Lookin' like I'm pacin' 
 Like hello, say hello to me 
 I elbowed my way into niggas conversations 
 I don't write rhymes 
 I commit death threats 
 This my new name if you ain't guessed yet! 
 Verse Three: 
 Yeah, this ain't Fif 
 It's more like a gift 
 A bottle of Cris 
 On side of a sip or a quality lick 
 I'm the shit 
 You try to be sick 
 I be ridin' with toddler's machine guns 
 While you be tryin' to be temp 
 I'm still hood 
 I move minus the bus pass 
 I entered poverty in with the new deluxe pass 
 This black nina 
 Told me I'm a black leader 
 That's why I be preachin' like David Beckham 
 Minus the mustache 
 But I ain't runnin' from nothin' 
 As long as rappers is runnin' 
 They receive death from a sentence like capitol punishment 
 The flows is mean 
 I make a nigga lean 
 Like putting the word "meth" 
 Up in between the words "pro" and "azine" 
 Your bitch bone right after my dick go fish 
 I leave her numb like a tongue after a coke kiss 
 I'm focused 
 I spit madness 
 You niggas is borin' 
 You at a level orange with your bitch-ass-ness 
 Plots is thickenin' 
 And I care about rappers 
 Bout as much as I care to see Janc and Roc 'C' bickerin' 
 Raps is sickenin' 
 Glocks is specifically hot 
 I'm trippin' 
 Is you with me or not?
