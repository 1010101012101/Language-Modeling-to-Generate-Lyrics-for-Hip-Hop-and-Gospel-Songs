I've been fucking with this game for a long time 
 And I'm impatient 
 I'ma kill somebody 
 If somebody don't make me real rich this year 
 For starters, I'm all about the bread 
 I ain't no artist, I'm a target, I'm like the landlord 
 Hip hop's currently fallen down the stairs 
 Your rent's due, motherfucker 
 Now who give a fuck about the bars the hardest? 
 When the DJs think they're bigger stars than the artists 
 Riding around in Ferraris, doing more A&R-ing than the A&Rs 
 And half 'em niggas don't even scratch 
 That's like the blind leading the blind leader 
 Hip hop is like the FBI in the trap reading The Don Diva 
 It makes no sense 
 It's ironic how I can straighten you though I stay so bent 
 I'm about getting ins, every time my money's on hip hop 
 That's every time the house nigga wins 
 Flooding the drought, loving the club, Crip/Blood, gun talk 
 Ladies and gentlemen, hip hop in one bar 
 I've been fucking with this game for a long time 
 And I'm impatient 
 I'ma kill somebody 
 If somebody don't make me real rich this year 
 Where my money at? 
 Where my money, nigga? 
 Where my money at? 
 Where my money, nigga? 
 I put a cease and desist on this industry shit 
 Me making a friend means I just make an enemy quick 
 When niggas think they finna be big, their images switch 
 They go from getting beat by a nigga too sweet to a cinnamon whip 
 They acting like they got the Vanna White in Wheel of Fortune 
 But actually they spilling the script 
 I tell a DJ to play mines so we gon' spray ya 
 And that's on every MC's mind, they just don't say it 
 I flame spots, my brain lies at the top, it's on fire 
 How you gonna say Nickle Nine ain't rising? 
 Rappers no longer have to be on the block lying 
 You get your ass whooped on the net, you a pop icon 
 I spaz like I got the right rhyme 
 I flash like I shot Nikon 
 I call my motherfucking man my money, so money stands out 
 While I got my motherfucking hand out 
 I've been fucking with this game for a long time 
 And I'm impatient 
 I'ma kill somebody 
 If somebody don't make me real rich this year 
 Where my money at? 
 Where my money, nigga? 
 Where my money at? 
 Where my money, nigga?
