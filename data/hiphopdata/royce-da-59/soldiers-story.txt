(Man talking w/ (Royce)) 
 We're in a situation, where everybody involved knows the stakes 
 (What up Reef) We're soldier's (*echoes*) 
 Soldiers don't go to hell, it's war 
 (Verse 1 - Royce da 5'9") 
 I'm Royce back on the drums, from the kick to the snare 
 Get them shits in the air, shit is fixin' to flair 
 (*Spit*) Spit on the beat, wrap it and ship it 
 Put it out, shit on the streets, that's me 
 Bust you in yo shit, and tell you don't you ever 
 That's me, I need respect, don't you better 
 That's me, chrome berretta, in the waistline 
 Of my own get up, I'm gone and still goin' (*Car horn*) 
 That's me, you hear a pop and see a drop, I'm comin' 
 That's me, when everybody on ya block is runnin' 
 That's me, wit the rocks that could block the sun in 
 The glock that I got, got a box it come in 
 I'm like the fear, that Biggie and Pac is comin' (Uh) 
 The reason why them baller boys cop them onions 
 That's me, 5 to the 9 doo rag be tied to the side 
 You could either ride with a die 
 (Chorus - Royce da 5'9") 
 Grooooom, yeah now you know a soldier's comin' 
 He came right into yo hood, and he sold you somethin' 
 He spit, wit a frozen flow, and he told you somethin' 
 I think I hear a soldier's comin', that's me 
 Grooooom, yeah now you know a soldier's comin' 
 You better run for it, run for it, run 
 Yeah now you know a soldier's comin' 
 You better run for it, run for it, run 
 (Bridge - Royce da 5'9") 
 We soldier's, (We) bats, (We) chains 
 (We) gats, (We) gain, (We) raps, (We) names 
 We soldier's, in the streets we eat, peep 
 Niggas is deep, and niggas'll creep, creep 
 (Verse 2 - Royce da 5'9") 
 Far from what you would call soft, you competing 
 What you would fall off, I'm beef, you call off 
 That's me, the one that you supposedly beef wit 
 That's me, we fought, but you kept it a secret 
 Talking bout what you gon' do when you find me and keep seeing me (Uh) 
 Lying like you dying to catch me, and put three in me (Uh) 
 Told him cut the jokes, but I guessed that he wan't hearin me (Uh) 
 Convince his self that he wan't fearing me 
 My niggas all killers, from the bottom straight to the top 
 Ride wit me rather know they destination or not 
 That's me, the baddest rap you heard in a while 
 Ride with the gat in the lap, convertible style 
 That's me, the killer that lurk in the dark 
 Tear up ya goddamn hood, from the church to the park 
 Grooooom, motherfucker, you hear that noise 
 You better run for it, run for it, run 
 (Chorus - Royce da 5'9") 
 Grooooom, yeah now you know a soldier's comin' 
 He came right into yo hood, and he sold you somethin' 
 He spit, wit a frozen flow, and he told you somethin' 
 I think I hear a soldier's comin', that's me 
 Grooooom, yeah now you know a soldier's comin' 
 You better run for it, run for it, run 
 Yeah now you know a soldier's comin' 
 You better run for it, run for it, run 
 (Verse 3 - Royce da 5'9") 
 Nothin' but underground shit, comin' out of my pump 
 The K fump from a pump, comin' out of my trunk (Uh) 
 Everybody wanna thug, wit them triggers they pullin 
 Be shootin pip-pip guns, that ain't as big as my bullets 
 Live from Detroit comin', to a block near you (Uh) 
 Real so-n-so, somebody might get popped near you (Uh) 
 All you wanna do is rap, I'll be listening right 
 After flippin a bit difference, between a clip and a mic 
 I'ma soldier (Soldier) cool as I wanna be 
 Gun totin, talkin' to hoes, rude as I wanna be 
 Who wants some of me, this is no problem 
 That I can't fix, I got a tool that I brung wit me (Uh) 
 Hardcore niggas your nothin' (Uh) 
 Ben Franklin run this motherfucker, and in God I trust him (Uh) 
 If you ever see my guns out, I'm probly bustin' 
 Why you niggas ridin' and dying, I'll be truckin 
 (Chorus - Royce da 5'9") 
 Grooooom, yeah now you know a soldier's comin' 
 He came right into yo hood, and he sold you somethin' 
 He spit, wit a frozen flow, and he told you somethin' 
 I think I hear a soldier's comin', that's me 
 Grooooom, yeah now you know a soldier's comin' 
 You better run for it, run for it, run 
 Yeah now you know a soldier's comin' 
 You better run for it, run for it, run 
 (Bridge - Royce da 5'9") 
 We soldier's, (We) bats, (We) chains 
 (We) gats, (We) gain, (We) raps, (We) names 
 We soldier's, in the streets we eat, peep 
 Niggas is deep, and niggas'll creep, creep

 Uh, uh, uh, uh 
 Royce Nickel 9, 2000
