 Out! (x4) 
 --Woman-- 
 "Statik Selektah" 
 --Black Milk-- 
 Yeah, uh, just when you thought it was safe 
 We came back to brawl and feel like you fought with an ape 
 But walked in his cage and can't get out 
 No way out, lost, feel like you walked in a maze 
 And yes, trying to walk a mile in my shoes is a waste 
 You couldn't even walk 10 paces 
 Yes, I already ran that race And 
 Already came in first place And 
 Black Milk, I'm like a horror film in the makin' 
 Spit that Freddy verse Jason 
 Believe when I say niggas move when I weigh like all comin' police car chases 
 Move, it gets that ugly 
 Yo bitch more money, but she can't get that from me 
 No, sound the alrm on em' 
 Still gunnin' 
 Sound like the fire men coming. 
 Hands to the sky 
 Get em' high 
 ??? Sound. 
 Detroit, the world go round'. 
 --Royce Da 5'9"-- 
 Nothin' else left to do but be the best with it 
 All I need is respect with it 
 It ain't goin' stop 
 I put yo flow in a bullet 
 Put it in my gun 
 And pull it like I'm playing roulette with it 
 It ain't goin' pop 
 I put yo brain in the blender for tryin' to figure out 
 How to enter the train of my thoughts 
 You ain't a contender 
 Why you still starvin' 
 I can put my hand on my dick like I'm still a star 
 As long as I feel large 
 I'm the real raw 
 Niggas can't kill God 
 Most incorrect politically next to Bill Maher 
 Arrest me, try to correct me with bars 
 Me, Black and Guilty next years' tsars 
 I'm bout' to put you fools on a diet 
 Put your food in a ring 
 And then I'm crownin' the biggest loser the king 
 Nigga try to try me then I'll prolly try to body these mobs 
 Then after that you gotta sound the alarm. 
 Hands to the sky 
 Get em' high 
 Mothafucka let's go 
 --Guilty Simpson-- 
 Steady the game and hit the ground runnin' 
 So when I start 
 Show you rap cats how to play that part 
 But we ain't actin' 
 They play him but he ain't crackin' 
 The same ol' same 
 With a verse so soft I sleep on it, the night off 
 When a nigga tries to speak on it, come again 
 Be in the streets, man 
 Fuck a benz 
 I got a 3 digit for the number man 
 'Cause when the scratch run out 
 Tre-5-7 watch that come out 
 I got a keen ear, boy, latch your mouth 
 Or repeat what you said while I'm at your house 
 But we don't knock 
 Kick through both locks then inflict bodily harm 
 Gun in my palm 
 You cats ain't even lukewarm 
 Man, sound the alarm. 
 Hands to the sky 
 Get em' high
