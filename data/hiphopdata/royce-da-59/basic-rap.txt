Uh, Uh 
 You, you, you 
 Nothin' about your 
 Flow, flow, flow 
 And make my mouth go 
 Down, down, down 
 Or my eyebrow go 
 You suck, suck! 
 Up, up 
 Nigga don't look at me like I knocked the party 
 'Cause I want you to leave my time like Doc and Marti 
 Titch, nigga get the fuck up, outta my era 
 You are not a part of my era 
 You (You, you, you) 
 You are making me sick 
 You can take two plus two, and make it extreme 
 Only blocks that you saw are the ones with the letters that teach you to spell 
 Rubix cubes and crews that chasin' a dream 
 So 
 Navy, weak as hell 
 (You, you, you) 
 Basic rapper, I hate you 
 Nigga rhymes done changed (You, you, you) 
 Go back, to the dates you came from (You, you, you) 
 Styles done advanced 
 RUN DMC is a classic (You, you, you) 
 Nigga get back, in your time machine 
 Basic rappers, I hate you 
 (You, you, you) 
 Go back, to the dates you came from (You, you, you) 
 Nigga rhymes done changed (You, you, you) 
 Styles done advanced 
 RUN DMC is a classic (You, you, you) 
 Nigga get back, in your time machine 
 On that green paper with the thick lines 
 I think you niggaz be writin' your rhymes 
 Niggaz use in kindergarten 
 Dudes like me, I'm holy like Synagogues 
 I'm, Godly pick the pen apart like I'm a god 
 To what you add up to like the back of a flash card 
 For you rap hard, but I know the answer 
 If you take heave to the make believe 
 Then you a 
 Niggaz rappin' like they be sayin' they ABC's then you whack 
 You, you, you 
 Nothin' about your 
 Flow, flow, flow 
 And make my mouth go 
 Down, down, down 
 Or my eyebrow go 
 Up, up 
 You suck, suck! 
 The highlight, of my life, is my writin' 
 When I hear a nigga in here, griffin' because 
 The type for five mics that strike like lightnin' 
 He finished a year, you think that he spittin', nigga no 
 That ain't how it goes 
 You gotta think of how many niggaz originated this shit 
 You think that how many niggaz is rich today in this bitch 
 How many of 'em broke? 
 You can say that many niggaz is dope?
