(Royce) Yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 (Chorus: Royce Da 5'9"") 
 (Gangsta!) The weight carries itself 
 Made man more concerned with wealth than he is his health 
 (Gangsta!) He pumps like 24... 
 247 just to get to heaven to pump some mo' 
 (Gangsta!) Heavyweight paper 
 Heart of a lion that beats longer than every pacemaker 
 Yeah! We ridin', we - gon' die foolin 
 Laws and rules don't apply to ME! (Gangsta!) 
 (Verse One: Royce Da 5'9"") 
 ... I'ma put this straight 
 I'm not gon' threaten you with hooks if you look this way 
 I'm not gon', write no songs - so please don't think 
 That since sometimes I'm quiet, that I bite my tongue 
 'Cause I will, slice you punks with knives that come with teeth 
 So leave with life as long's you come in peace 
 I'm the protocol of all the street rules 
 Soldiers, ballers please, I know all them 
 I'm goin' all out - for everything I believe in 
 Niggaz bleed behind things that I know about 
 Yeah, yeah (Gangsta!) Hear me roar 
 Feel me nigga; naw fuck that, feel me more 
 And whoever sayin' 'fuck me' can suck me 
 And we can bang, I done came a long way from "U Can't Touch Me", nigga! 
 Yeah! I'm ridin', I am gon' die foolin 
 Laws and rules don't apply to ME! 
 (Verse Two: Royce Da 5'9"") 
 ... My swagger's crazy 
 We can, forget your momma ever had a baby 
 Regis; I don't care who the fuck you is 
 Keep yo', hands to yo'self, I will cut yo' limbs OFF 
 Sixty shots'll quickly hit you 
 Pop Dixie Chicks of rap, PISS ME OFF! 
 Yeah, I'm strictly Pesci - you hear me a made man 
 I will rather you fear me than to have you respect me 
 Yeah, t
