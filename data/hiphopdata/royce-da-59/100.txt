As I look up to the sky 
 Thought about a 100 things to do before I die 
 Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right 
 And my family live that life 
 As I look up to the sky 
 Thought about a 100 things to do before I die 
 Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life 
 'Cause it could all end in one night 
 As I look up to the sky 
 I thought about a 100 things to do before I die 
 Couple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type 
 Same shit different nights, till I live a different life 
 Sean you looking tired, damn homie that's all 
 I've been stressin' so hard I'm surprised I ain't going bald 
 Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms 
 Take online classes and turn back into y'all, hatin' 
 I guess they want your lights out when you the plug 
 Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug 
 From where they move the drugs, buddha love 
 Niggas sleepin' with that mac and I ain't talkin' bout computer love 
 All the wrong people you a price tag 
 Now you pray to god hoping that you got a Christ tag 
 Make it where I'm from, stay who I become 
 Time to raise hell, say nay my son 
 Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view 
 And have the fam there too 
 As I look up to the sky 
 Thought about a 100 things to do before I die 
 Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right 
 And my family live that life 
 As I look up to the sky 
 Thought about a 100 things to do before I die 
 Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life 
 'Cause it could all end in one night 
 As I look up to the sky 
 I thought about a 100 things to do before I die 
 If I just stop breathin', even though I got all this muthafuckin' money 
 Wont keep my heart beatin' 
 Just don't let me die 
 Wake me up 
 You can't catch me dreamin' 
 Bout all of this muthafuckin' money 
 Cocaine rush, I'm speedin' 
 Cocaine rush 
 I'm just a detroit nigga, nothing extra about me 
 I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me 
 I strive for perfection at the same time 
 I'm accepting the fact that there'll never be nothing perfect about me 
 Shit, I'm just waiting on a win 
 Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin 
 We are 6 mile bred, that's why you see our sick style yeah 
 Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs 
 Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me 
 The baddest chick is yonking, imagine this yapping at me 
 5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon 
 Now I'm cali swaggin' 
 My nigga listen, I'm over the fame 
 You number 1, I'm 23, my mission is take over the game 
 You rollin' with lames, we ain't rollin' the same 
 I'm the best out in this muthafucker 
 If I could get a check out of this muthafucka big enough to set my kids up for life 
 I could check out of this muthafucka, with no regrets 
 If you ain't living your life for ya kids, I ain't giving yo ass no respect 
 (Sean, I love you my nigga, I'm out)

 I gotta break ya fuckin' heart 
 I gotta climb these fuckin' charts (I gotta climb) 
 I gotta do something that's innovative 
 Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part 
 I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with tia and tia's momma 
 Breakfast in bed is head with plenty of carne asada (I gotta) 
 I gotta find me a wife to elope (I gotta) 
 I got a fine, 'cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise 
 I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive 
 But those who lied to the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave 
 I can easily pretend like y'all, but that's not me 
 I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth 
 Need to know every detail about this earth, the devil controls it 
 So before you scrutinize how I feel ask god if those polls important 
 The end is near!
