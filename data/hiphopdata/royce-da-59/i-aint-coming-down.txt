I'm floating away without leaving the ground, ground 
 They're asking me what's it like up there 
 I tell 'em I ain't coming down 
 I'm trying to stay up but I don't wanna touch down, down 
 They're asking me what's it like up there 
 I tell 'em I ain't coming down 
 No, no, no, I ain't coming down 
 No, no, I ain't coming down 
 No, no, I ain't coming down 
 I ain't coming down 
 Uh, now that my vision's more clearer 
 This is for the hate on Royce in Detroit era 
 I know y'all had a good time 
 But that was your time but that was your era 
 Now look at you and look at me, compare us 
 You can do it easily just saying 
 "Man, Royce is looking stupid on that beef DVD", uh, uh 
 Shout out my niggas D Twizzy, I'll admit when I was wrong 
 I remember fake and I should probably hit my nigga Vaughn 
 You're talking shit about me at your barbershop 
 You obviously politiciking wrong 
 Niggas need to stop PMSing 
 I hope your barbers give your ass 
 The same hairline as me and DMX's 
 I went from wishing treat, trick was gone 
 From picking which bitch to wishing I would Twit' pick my home 
 And as far my nigga Trey, before we was brothers 
 I think we really just needed to get to know each other, I'm up 
 I'm floating away without leaving the ground, ground 
 They're asking me what's it like up there 
 I tell 'em I ain't coming down 
 I'm trying to stay up but I don't wanna touch down, down 
 They're asking me what's it like up there 
 I tell 'em I ain't coming down 
 No, no, no, I ain't coming down 
 No, no, I ain't coming down 
 No, no, I ain't coming down 
 I ain't coming down 
 Uh, I gotta say the shit one time 
 When have you ever known me to get in the way of one's grind 
 'Cause even when that dark cloud hovered above me 
 I went from signed to unsigned and I found my own sunshine 
 Uh, now let me say the shit one more time 
 When have you ever known to get in the way of your grind 
 Can you find one hip hop listener 'round the globe 
 Who don't know that Nick 1 9 is from Motown? 
 These cats say he's whack 
 He ain't even from the D so why he got that d'Ã©tat? 
 Then their friends run to me like 
 "My friend saw you ciphering on BET 
 But he ain't like it 'cause you ain't have on no D hat" 
 Make up your mind, you whining niggas 
 Crying in business schools to talk, bought shoes for shawties 
 Bought coats the kids while you niggas choose to floss 
 And y'all wanna nail to who to the cross, y'all niggas soft from up 
 I'm floating away without leaving the ground, ground 
 They're asking me what's it like up there 
 I tell 'em I ain't coming down 
 I'm trying to stay up but I don't wanna touch down, down 
 They're asking me what's it like up there 
 I tell 'em I ain't coming down 
 No, no, no, I ain't coming down 
 No, no, I ain't coming down 
 No, no, I ain't coming down 
 I ain't coming down
