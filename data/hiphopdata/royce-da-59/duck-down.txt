(Royce Da 5'9") 
 Yeah, yeah 
 I'm on ya phone, ya friends and killas ya compone 
 Till I comb ya home from the village to California 
 Runnin' up on ya dozen, holmes 
 You wasn't be gone, I'll send ya mother a dozen roses 
 I'll make ya boss wish that he had 
 Somethin' that's more viscous and killin' everything that he had 
 Past you, I ain't only lyrically killin' you bad 
 Killin' you with a passion, and then I'm stealin ya casket 
 Too many problems following me sayin' that "I am the king" 
 I am a dream, I helps my gang 
 Not to offend or hurt the work you put it, my street niggas feel it 
 It's self proclaimed 
 So, who wanna creep, what weaklig wanna beef 
 Ben Franklin run the streets, he came in a hundred deep! 
 You niggas can keep ya thirty murkers 
 I offer 'em all extra money man them niggas is workers 
 Where was them niggas when you had dreds you lyin' 
 You Mehki-Phifer lay on ya side like a hyphen 
 Nigga I ain't built for +Whoo Bitch+ what now?

 A truce is impossible, fuck you 
 It's over you was responsible, for the drunk you

 The problems, that, 
 All of you did somethin' that you can't take back 
 Y'all all know what it is, compete on wax 
 Is what we coulda did, 
 What you think that ya man is so hard just 'cause he don't rap? 
 What is a street nigga relatin a combat 
 If he had put you in the grave then maybe I'm that 
 Type of nigga like you I call you a cheapskate 
 Cause you cheap and when its beef in the streets you skate 
 Nigga you can't deny the force 
 3500 in the streets?, aww just so you can die on my porch 
 Punk, I will bust my guns till the rounds are finished 
 You gone kill who? I be stickin around for a minute 
 Plus, "I'll be on my way" 
 You sound like somebody who sound like somebody, 
 I don't believe nothin' you say 
 I will make you're group feel like shit pussy 
 Hang where I hang nigga I will take yo booth 
 A truce is impossible, fuck you 
 It's over you was responsible, for the drunk you 
 We punk you, when I see you you better DUCK! 
 Vmmmmm!, one of them guns'll go boom 
 Boom boom ...
