All you gotta do is say my name 
 I'll make the gun sang 
 Like ooh through the war 
 I'll have you niggas bleeding 
 Laying down lookin' (???) 
 Close you mouth before yo mouth 
 Get you into something with them Detroit niggas 
 We Deep 
 Verse 1 (Royce da 5'9): 
 Come on with that, The throne's in tact 
 We the reason niggas gotta buy they own shit back 
 30 niggas spit black in this bitch trap 
 Foul mouth niggas get a clip full of tic-tacs 
 Mister Porter sick track, Trick Trick back 
 This that riff-raff tell ya bitch lick that 
 Alcoholic ass click this a big frat 
 Cross the line when we steppin' there's gonna be click clack 
 Niggas fakin they throwin' them hissy fits 
 They make a start but they ain't makin' out like your boy and his kissy bitch 
 Till they get taken out like you boy do his prissy bitch 
 My high price lawyers still hood like a dickie fit 
 My words like a 44 on page 
 Hold on, you gonna collapse like Jojo on stage 
 If you ever fuck around me I'll lift you 
 It's however you want it long as I ain't gotta ride witchou 
 Verse 2 (Trick Trick): 
 The god father and the king of the D 
 Leave these niggas slept butt ass naked like they was sleepin' with me 
 You little bad mouth faggot as lil' boys 
 I was bustin' 762s when y'all was playin' with toys 
 Transformers or GI Joes 
 Motherfucker you like playin' games well see I don't 
 I like, givin' the orders for distributin' the satchel 
 Denyin' the allegations that I was the one that gotchou 
 Kill em' all and let the lord sort 'em out 
 Duct tape covered the lines and board up the house 
 Go on nigga run yo mouth go outta place 
 But hide your momma brothers and sisters cause nobody's safe 
 I paid mine a long time ago, you ain't seen dues 
 I got a family that'll knock these bitches outta they shoes 
 So listen to a professional, we'll get the best of you 
 And run a gas truck through the center of your position, nigga 
 Verse 3 (Both): 
 (Royce) Show me some respect or get your shit checked 
 You act dry then you probably gonna get your shit wet 
 I ain't tryin' to be big, give me a big check 
 This spit tek gonna split up your team like dip set 
 (Trick) Okay, see these niggas rollin' deep in the truck 
 Got the world sayin' Detroit niggas skeetchy as fuck 
 Takin' niggas shit for nothin' but if you say somethin' 
 40 automatic double clips are we dumpin' 
 (Royce) Boy we hot, look at the dough we got 
 Broke no we not, he spoke and you know he shot 
 Sluggin' with 40 shot, the booth is my porty pot 
 My crew startin' shit like your boy 40 (???) 
 (Trick) You niggas worried 'bout me you better worry 'bout sweets 
 Doom Squad, M.I.C. controllin' the streets 
 Fuck with niggas that take bread for heads 
 Cocain slangas, fuck you little sissy ass MySpace gang-bangers
