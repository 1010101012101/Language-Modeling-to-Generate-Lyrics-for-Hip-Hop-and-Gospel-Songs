Stop, picture me scrubs in the room with hip hop 
 Operating on it with my instruments 
 I'm the doc, it's crunch time 
 Line up rappers I don't like and call that shit a punchline 
 These niggas e-beefing that ain't what war's about 
 Ain't nothing dying but the game, pull the organs out 
 These niggas dissing like they wondering where Malcolm's at 
 Till I split 'em where they scalp is at, where my scalpel at? 
 I ain't been hearing hard, I'm about to check his pulse 
 With my stethoscope pressed against the records store 
 We ride in, we gon' W-I-N 
 I will check the bitch ass like the OB/GYN 
 I'm respected like a killer or reckon like Thriller 
 I will keep a tab on you like Twitter, now feel the hate and roll 
 Nigga give 'em oxygen and shock him with that, that 
 Defibrillator flow 
 Long as I'm alive the game gon' be breathing 
 Even though it's wheezing 
 Hit him like, like clear 
 Wake his ass up, he was sleeping, yeah 
 I said as long as I'm alive the game gon' be breathing 
 Even though it's wheezing 
 Hit him like, like clear 
 Wake his ass up, he was sleeping 
 I'm alive, they almost killed me 
 But I survived, hip hop has been revived 
 Surprise, okay doc, ow, stop shocking me now 
 Tell your nurse she could put the scalpel down 
 I'm back, ready to rap, took a little nap, ready to go 
 I'll stick to my pen, never again will I ever doze off 
 No more bozo rap, it hurt me, the new dojo in beast mode 
 I'm John Cleese, no mercy 
 My saliva and spit can fly through a brick 
 Put your ass by a lighter and spit gas at the fire, flick 
 Gave up on me, huh? I was worse than the racists 
 Or rapists but now I'm feeling like Kobe 'fore he scored eighty-one 
 Really feeling new, miss me with the skinny jeans and UGGs 
 'Fore god in here, I ain't feeling you 
 Fucking incredible, I could dig a hole to hell just to beat the devil 
 Over the head with a fucking shovel 
 Long as I'm alive the game gon' be breathing 
 Even though it's wheezing 
 Hit him like, like clear 
 Wake his ass up, he was sleeping, yeah 
 I said as long as I'm alive the game gon' be breathing 
 Even though it's wheezing 
 Hit him like, like clear 
 Wake his ass up, he was sleeping
