Shoot wit us... 
 (Chorus 2X: Royce Da 5'9") 
 You gon' need a lot more guns to shoot wit us 
 It's gon' take a lot more power to fuck wit us 
 A lot more jewels to floss wit us 
 And a lot more niggaz to buck wit us 
 I'm the King of Detroit, I'm the King of the Kings 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 The King of the ring, cause y'all niggaz be swingin' the sting 
 Imagine a thought of that 
 I'm doin' my thing, you only worth TWO of my rings 
 It's you and my team, at war for tryin' to ruin my reign 
 It's Motown, it's where this black music shit started at 
 All I did was brought it back 
 Get it right, I'm over your block and I must succeed 
 These niggaz rippin and robbin with the fifth in the closet 
 I don't know how much you need, but it's more than you got 
 Cause y'all niggaz ignorant logic got you slippin and dodgin 
 We bring to a violent halt whatever beef we have 
 I hate losin, so you'll probably never see me mad 
 It's the size of the gun, the trigger and the nigga behind it 
 Just here to rewind it back to where time had begun 
 I'm the King of the throne, I stood up to sing you a song 
 To get the platinum plaques back to the city, bring it home 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo 
 You welcome to floss and receive a consecutive loss 
 All I need's a second to talk to get my message across 
 Out-of-towners come to Detroit with all they mens 
 And that's a gamble, you know the house always wins 
 I'm the savior of rap, y'all wanna be like the third verse missed 
 Street this, thug that - rhymin my life in first-person 
 You could never rise, no matter how high it seems 
 I'm the man with a eye, in the land of the blind of Kings 
 Trust this, no one could touch this - the difference is 
 The average nigga brings it to jail, that's why I bring it to justice 
 My shit be well-thought out, y'all niggaz just writin a rhyme 
 That's why most of the time you bitin a rhyme 
 I'm simple and plain, quick to speak a nigga in vain 
 Cause niggaz done changed, it's very few niggaz with brain 
 Speak from your heart, and I aim for your chest, I'm done wit it 
 Y'all rap niggaz want your respect?Then come get it 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 Yo, yo, yo... we must, represent for us 
 'Cause where we from, we eat, sleep and shit Detroit and that's us 
 Y'all slide by, side by the real niggaz 
 Ain't nothin' but stand by to get killed niggaz - what! 
 Tryna make the most of this time, we ain't inside forever 
 This is life, nobody makes it out alive - NEVER 
 I'm the King of the throne, I stood up to sing you a song 
 To get the platinum plaques back to Detroit, bring it home
