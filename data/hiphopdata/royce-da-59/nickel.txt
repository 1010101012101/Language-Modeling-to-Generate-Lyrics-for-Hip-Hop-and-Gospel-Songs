(Chorus: Royce) 
 (Nickel) Nine, witness me rippin this apart 
 For sixty bars, the city is ours 
 We the M-I, C; the illest to ever spit on a track 
 I'm (Nickel) Nine, ladies say it with me now 
 So lean back - lean back 
 (Nickel) Nine, I am the king of the track 
 Matter fact Nottz bring it back, GO! 
 (M.I.C.) Watch me 
 (Royce Da 5'9") 
 The lack of your strength is the end of where my bladder begins 
 Yeah, 5-9'll piss or shit on your pad or your pen 
 Go ahead, gather your men 
 The few left stragglin in after I been clappin had to pretend 
 It wasn't so bad, bustin' those mag's 
 Somethin' for your old ass like a pack of Depends 
 Back then us thugs had to depend on what drug was crackin' 
 Because it wasn't no black-owned businesses (whoa) 
 Tack on who didn't wanna act as gentlemen (whoa) 
 Act on adrenelin, the cap gon' peel 'em 
 Either that or rap gon' kill 'em - send them niggaz 
 In them skull caps like "Menace" with black on black to get 'em (whoa) 
 From the tires to the tents to them snap-on spinners 
 High off 'caine, robbin everything 
 It's simple - 4 or 5 niggaz ride with me 
 Equals 4 or 5 fo'-fives stickin out of my window (like bloaw!) 
 This amount to the passin, of the fathers 
 Of the now bastards, but it's not about math 
 It's about, who's the ho 
 Tryna prove to me you hard, squeeze your tool, lose a toe 
 You artists get the real footage of the squad you should know 
 I will put it like a movie so 
 Watchin the dude, the product move quick as them dudes from "Blow" 
 Did it, leave room to grow 
 Bigger than the hood that you can't leave like "The Truman Show" 
 Matter fact Nottz, bring it back 
 Why even bring your DAT's when I am the king of rap 
 Now you say 'Maybach' in your rhymes because it rhyme with 'laid back' 
 Go! {*record scratches*} Watch me 
 Right under the train tracks, with one of your ladies 
 Like that's the only thing that it rhyme with 
 How about come up outta your braze cap 
 You gonna get laid flat or you gonna behave 
 Put this gun to your wave cap and get under your waves 
 Because you keep the nine witchu - you gettin' your mind lifted 
 Quicker than knockin' 'em men, I'm too blowed to rhyme witchu (whoa) 
 You little weak guys should keep 
 Them loc's in Cali I know be them pie-flippers 
 Doin' drive-bys on lowrider bicycles (bloaw bloaw!) 
 The murder case you beat to yourselves and throw up the peace sign (peace!) 
 One of my niggaz beat five 
 But I don't let the battle rap haunt me 
 I call him Homicide Juan, I'ma sign him then free Shyne 
 Cardier band frosty, wearin what a fan bought me 
 Somebody get this avalanche off me, the van hawk us 
 Cheeseburger servin' faggot ass tarts 
 Hang with them chaldeons, them Taliban talkers'll 
 Or, get your tan darkened, from the heat from the flame 
 From the thang speakin' sayin' "Keep your hands off me" 
 Beat the pants off you for bein stand-off 
 Pullin all of y'all cards 
 We dangerous, only games we play is "Callin all cars" (call all cars!) 
 We all drive reckless, change cars like Baby 
 Make Flex say, "Y'all on some Wyclef shit" 
 For those that don't know 
 We just picture a soldier with a rose gold soul with a frozen, flow 
 Who will rhyme till the climate is cold 
 Diamonds in the rose like Pocanos snow 
 I'm like Alpo, AZ, Rich 
 Mixed with Jay-Z and 'Kiss with "pay me, bitch!"I'm...
