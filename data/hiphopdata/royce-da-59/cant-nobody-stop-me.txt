From as far back as I can remember 
 Me and my man vicious 
 We was always 
 Taught to shoot for the stars 
 M.i.c. 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 No way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 Ain't no way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 No way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 Ain't no way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Long as the check stay ill 
 And the record stay real 
 Imma definitely never see how second place feels 
 I'm a striver 
 I learn from my father 
 To burn like lava 
 I am a survivor 
 The problem is to 
 Even as a kid 
 I've been meaning to be 
 The heir to the chair 
 Of the kings 
 And I vowed to myself that 
 I woulndt melt 
 I would rise to the top 
 With the power of myself 
 Can't nobody stop my wealth 
 My dreams, or team up without my help 
 For sures, its better to chase ya 
 I base this on pure competitive nature 
 Waiting 
 For the day that we make plans 
 To compete 
 Win or lose shake hands 
 These are the views 
 Of the dudes of tomorrow 
 Who will win 
 'Cause they shoot for the stars 
 And refuse to lose 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 No way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 Ain't no way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 No way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 Ain't no way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 As long as the check stay ill 
 And the record stay real 
 Imma definitely never see how second place feels 
 Got the mind of a rhymer 
 Conquer your roster 
 Squad full of mobsters 
 As hungry as a hostage 
 YEA! 
 I will never fear 
 'Cause I need to succeed 
 You can tell in my stare that I care 
 If I lose I'm a winner 
 So I move with a vision 
 Never fool with the timid 
 Rather ???? 
 (Come on) 
 Can't stop my mission 
 Too vicious for you 
 Who step into the trenches 
 RAW... talent 
 Never back down 
 Bring the challenge 
 Imma be standing 
 Laughing 
 At y'all's faces 
 Cause y'all mad 
 The dirty looks 
 Would never shake this man 
 Full steam ahead 
 For the cake 
 For the bread 
 Till I'm fed 
 Go hard 
 At 'em all 
 And refuse to lose 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 No way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 Ain't no way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 No way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 Ain't no way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 (Come on) 
 (Come on) 
 (Come on) 
 Long as the check stay ill 
 And the record stay real 
 Imma definitely never see how second place feels 
 You lead 
 The teams 
 Fatigue 
 Breathe 
 Believe in song 
 (Ughh) 
 (Come on) 
 For sures, its better to chase ya 
 I base this on pure competitive nature 
 You can lose your shoes 
 Give the crews the blues 
 Go hard at 'em all 
 And refuse to lose 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 No way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 Ain't no way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 No way to stop me (nuhuh) 
 Can't nobody stop me (nuhuh) 
 Ain't no way to stop me (nuhuh)
