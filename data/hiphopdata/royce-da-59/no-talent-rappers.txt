Verse 1 (Cutty Mac): 
 I fell in love with hip hop... 
 I wanna rap cousin, 
 That's hen he gave me a brick, 
 Told me rap something, 
 Crack something, 
 Act something, 
 Pack something, 
 Stack something, 
 That's something, 
 Gats stuntin, 
 Don't make me clap something, 
 I tell niggas once... 
 Then I'm back busting, 
 Gats dumping, 
 That's dumping, 
 Pass me the bag youngin, 
 I beat niggas bloody, 
 Weak niggas swear they... 
 Thugs, till they mugs full of blood, 
 They say J nutty, 
 Whenever rock bottom, 
 I'm on the block wilin', 
 Flock niggas stock pollens, 
 Squads out the drop clownin... 
 On my 7-digit, 
 Bitch youa never get it, 
 Spitting like that... 
 I'm in the kitchen writing raps, 
 With the cheddar sittin', 
 By the glocks and the ?drabs?, 
 And the box of seran, 
 Where bakin soda vision 
 With pots and the pans, 
 Rockin' a slab, 
 Niggas swear they were shittin, 
 Till they rottin in a bag. 
 Mid Verse (royce): 
 You hearin the beat... 
 Niggas here with Juan... 
 Cutty Mac... Me... 5'9 
 ... 
 The streets is mine... 
 Ride out! 
 Verse 2 (Royce): 
 I'm in the drop wit the top up wit cash 
 Mashin the pot wit the glock in the stash 
 You boxin you possibly got... just shot in yo ass 
 Dropped in a box in the trash 
 Chopped into pieces... stabbed 
 Wit the top of you leaking... 
 Feet from the opposite half of you reekin, 
 Cops with they badges, keepin' me stocked up fo cheap, 
 Charges get dropped quick as I could get knocked 
 And I'm back on my feet, 
 The untracable track "mop and the bleach", 
 It's a check if he gets on it, 
 Spits on it, 
 Wreckin the next nigga destined to flip on it, 
 For that paper with the dead presidents on it, 
 Best flow nigga put yo neck and ya wrist on it, 
 A soldier be rollin' fo doe and for dollars, 
 Yo flow to mines is, like a rover to a ?diappallo?. 
 *Mid-verse 
 Verse 3 (Juan): 
 In a spot in a lab, 
 Killin' niggas is something that's probly ?bad? 
 On a block with the mag, 
 While the track spitting mad, 
 Killin' whole staffs, 
 Whippin compontents choppin the whole car in half, 
 I'm a gangsta nigga, 
 If I can't care nigga, 
 Shankin nigga, 
 Make a nigga, 
 Shakin until he, 
 Skatin in a, 
 Ambulance wit the sirens off, 
 With the benz whippin off, 
 Let my little youngins take the tires off, 
 Real hip hop... 
 Snitches get dropped 
 Cocain... operation skip/watch 
 I spit it street 'cause it's in me... 
 I know Death is Certain so I merk a nigga fo he merk me, 
 Niggas act silly, 
 Till they catch a chilly, 
 Put a slug in em, 
 Till he shittin ?pissarini? 
 I'mma nut punk 
 Bust pump 
 Snatch trunk 
 Mashed up 
 Smack chumps 
 Look at 'em like "And What!"
