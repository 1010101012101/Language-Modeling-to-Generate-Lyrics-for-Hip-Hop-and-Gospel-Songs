 Security 
 Lemme tell y'all a story about somebody I feel was a gangster 
 And that's the very same reason he ain't here with me no mo' 
 He marched around the corna' like a soldier 
 But not to get no on-the-mic exposure 
 To question me, I guess he checkin' me 
 I'm feelin' like I'm lookin' at my own self in the face 
 As deaths destiny awaits 
 Us both wearin' vests's, us both stressed from the same pressures 
 Us both fuckin' train-wreck reckless 
 Guns whip out, he had a nine, I had a forty 
 I remember a point in time where he had mine, I had his shorty 
 And I could cry tellin' this story 
 If you can visualize a downtown crowded street 
 Somebody was eatin' 'n saw P pull out his piece 
 And decided to reach 
 (Security yeah yeah) 
 Police rolled up on us like "police freeze!" 
 (Security yeah yeah) 
 Cuffed us up like nothin' 
 (Security yeah yeah) 
 Asked us what we got guns for, we told 'em it's for 
 (Security yeah yeah) 
 (Proof this one's for you! I love you doody) 
 Lemme tell y'all a story about somebody I feel was a gangster 
 And that's the very same reason he ain't here with me no mo' 
 He marched up out his house like a soldier, decided to titty-bar it 
 A lot of alcohol consumption and drug use, while out with the city's hardest 
 Niggas, foldin' money up with black face, flickin' photos 
 The only thing he was missin' was my nigga dolo 
 He decided to leave them and go to an after-hour 
 After the four hour, 
 He act crazier than Scarface after snortin' powder 
 He get into it with this dude, point his piece at him 
 They say he shot him, problem is, I don't believe that 
 And on the real I, only know shots flew 
 And when the smoke cleared they say he got killed by 
 (Security yeah yeah) 
 Shot my nigga like that, that 
 (Security yeah yeah) 
 Probably shoulda watched his back 
 (Security yeah yeah) 
 It's fucked up, right? 
 (Security yeah yeah) 
 (Proof this one's for you! I love you doody) 
 Lemme tell y'all a story about somebody I feel was a gangster 
 And that's the very same reason he ain't here with me no mo' 
 I know y'all seen Beef three 
 And it probably made you think that I ain't like Shady 
 The truth is, I was at Proofs funeral, cryin' like a baby 
 I was sittin' in the back row 
 With Vicious, wishin' I can go up to Marshall, 
 Denaun, Swifty, Obie, Bizarre, Paul, Levaughn 
 And say somethin' positive 
 After all the negative shit that we been through 
 Thinkin' we'd talk one day if it was meant to 
 Reservations 'bout walkin' up there 'n gettin' in the way 
 It's probably better off to just pray 
 Thinkin' my niggas are dyin' 
 It was my first time at an over thousand people funeral with 
 (Security yeah yeah) R.I.P. 
 (Security yeah yeah) We love you, P 
 (Security yeah yeah) R.I.P. 
 (Security yeah yeah) 
 (Proof this one's for you! I love you doody)
