My homie's a magician with the Tec 
 Make your chain disappear and reappear on his neck 
 I ain't tricking with you hoes, but shit don't ask him 
 Only thing I give a bitch? A fucking orgasm 
 I'll throw you in the river, hands tied tight 
 Watch your ass drown, feel it in the air tonight 
 I'm spitting that dope shit, smoking on regulars 
 Writing 16's like internet child predators 
 Rocking that 10 deep, but I stay dolo 
 You wearing polo, who are you, Young Dro? 
 I'm fifth floor at the Bellagio 
 Vegas bitches that's resembling Rosario 
 Dawson, awesome, hit the head, Mario 
 Sorry yo, my tongue long, she squirted off the sheets 
 She gave me that Becky, I gave her that yoshi 
 The only time you niggas touch keys is Motif 
 Go and sell a beat, you never sold a rock 
 Still be sitting on the couch if I was signed to Koch 
 Coulda signed to the Roc, nah I'm signed to the streets 
 The D is the only thing that's profiting for me 
 Feeling like Big Meech, when we're about to cook up 
 But not the one from B.M.F. dog, the one from Lynwood 
 It ain't a nigga I know, three years straight, three dollar blows 
 Good any hood, anywhere I go I'm straight 
 Nigga hit me with a hundred cause the look on my face 
 Mama I'm honored to be your son 
 Could snatch a stack of stamps out and not rip a single one 
 Used to be in a rush, to finish off my sack 
 I was so thirsty dog, sold a pregnant bitch crack 
 Let her pay me extra, smoke it in the back 
 Then she came back, tities on smacking herself on the back 
 Talking about something crawling on her 
 Looking like the world's falling on her and I pushed it 
 You rub the foots of the witches I mushed 
 Funky ass cutlass three deep, blowing kush 
 North got her shook 
 Started reading once the judge threw the fucking book 
 But the block was off the hook, said fuck class 
 Off them same pills that had Carlton dancing fast 
 Young buck, look, now a grown up 
 Now I pop those same pills, listening to Donuts 
 I rap like I bet my life cause in all actuality, nigga I did 
 You rap like you used to hit the pipe 
 Nah nigga that ain't crack, that's crack head shit 
 Rep that shit, will tell a bitch 
 You wouldn't break a brick, you ain't seeing this dick 
 You trick on the bitch, dog you ain't rich 
 Take a bitch to the movies, take her to the crib 
 You seeing Brown? Nope, never 
 'Bout to live the title of the greatest rapper ever
