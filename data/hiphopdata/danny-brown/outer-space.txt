Meet the future face to face 
 And make sure feel like you there in outer space 
 We need to see 
 It's the Adderall Admiral, writing holy mackerel 
 Your bitch say my dick long like the strap on a satchel 
 I took me a capsule with no hassle 
 Now it's like I dip feathers of ink in a castle 
 A prodigy like bullets that hit your left clavicle 
 No sweatsuits and paint the avenue 
 You have no clue like toy stores without board games 
 But when I paint pictures, I'm dipping brushes in war paint 
 I'm a mothafuckin' mothafucka 
 Fucking on your mother with two rubbers, I do fuck her 
 No cover just her booty on her pillow 
 Your bitch said my dick tastes like tropical fruit Skittles 
 I'm bumping Bill Wither, Swishers on Schwarzenegger 
 Matter fact, nah nigga, they on Boa Constrictors, they'll choke a nigga 
 These niggas ain't rappers, they mothafuckin' characters 
 Caught your baby momma horny then I stuck a carrot in her 
 Then you made a salad with her, ate isht for dinner 
 I don't want that skinny bitch look like that ho from Thinner 
 Swore she played soccer, she was real good with headers 
 Had me yelling "Goal!" while I was sitting on the dresser 
 Give the bitch a hat trick, smoking on the cat piss 
 I keep the bitch wet, around you she's a cactus 
 I got them Penis Psalms for your Vagina Monologues 
 Love a feminist bitch, oh, it get my dick hard 
 So no apologies for all the misogyny 
 I just want your company to come and watch some porn with me 
 My oral orchestration causes manipulation 
 The way these hoes be chasing thought I had the tongue of Satan 
 But I just gave 'em dick to get more for conversation 
 Why you niggas tricking, givings your obligation 
 You safe havens, I'm Wes Craven with X cravings 
 Fuck a bitch mouth until her fucking face cave in 
 Hidden cams in her house, I caught her masturbating 
 Extorted her for the cash, now your ass paying 
 You Captain Save-Them-Ass, nigga 
 I don't give a bitch shit but hard dick and liquor 
 So so nice to meet you, I hope that you're safe
