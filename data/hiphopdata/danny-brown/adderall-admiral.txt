Eating on an Adderall, wash it down with alcohol 
 Writing holy mackerel, actual or factual 
 Out for the capital, matador ya capsules 
 Hassle the bitch in a castle with ill grapples 
 Tackled her asshole, my dick like a lasso 
 Fucked her in her mouth then washed it down with Tabasco 
 Uh, you softer than Flanders' son 
 Don't make me put hands on son 
 Jump niggas like fuck one on one 
 Used to be locked up watching One on One 
 And Young Kyla Pratt was looking thick, nigga wanted some 
 But soon as I got out white bitches by the tons 
 Dave Brock: 
 One more touch and then you'll see 
 World of hidden mystery 
 Visions of you know you're only dreamin' 
 Danny Brown: 
 I fuck bad bitches to Stacy Lattisaw 
 While you niggas got blue balls like a Avatar 
 I mean caviar in El Salvador 
 She running from my dick like it's a bull and she the matador 
 She a pregnant labrador 
 Said my metaphors are the highest caliber 
 Uh, I spit hard, you Hallmark card poets 
 So many lines, you can bar code it 
 She like to lick it on the head then slow stroke it 
 Ocean in her panties and I'm 'bout to float through it 
 Rewind this and just smoke to it
