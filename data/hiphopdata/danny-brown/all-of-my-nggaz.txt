All my niggas really want the money 
 We don't want nothing else nigga I promise 
 All my niggas really want the money 
 All my niggas really want the money 
 All my niggas really want the money 
 We don't want nothing else nigga I promise 
 All my niggas really want the money 
 All my niggas really want the money 
 All we want is the money, the mozzarella, Galbani 
 I got more guns than the army, can't let no bitch nigga harm me 
 I got that purple like Barney, I got two bitches that's horny 
 They say they niggas is corny, they never there and they lonely 
 They bought a bottle of 'trony and now they ready to blow me 
 If you know me you owe me, that's what I told her for sho' 
 I'm a mac just like Goldie, me and my cronies and brodies 
 Rollies and stogies, stay with the fifties and forties 
 That's us if you smell smoke, cookies the antidote 
 Puffing that rope-a-dope, my partner's they kinfolk 
 They rap and they sell coke, bust ya head like a cantaloupe 
 In the summer, a peacoat, my iPhone is jailbroke 
 Leaning like the Tower of Pisa, promethazina 
 Sweatin' like we under a heater, it's hot in here 
 All them suckers that's talking crazy, they not in here 
 Never tell my right ear what my left ear hear 
 All my niggas really want the money 
 We don't want nothing else nigga I promise 
 All my niggas really want the money 
 All my niggas really want the money 
 I'm up before the sun up, the work it be uncut 
 I break it in pieces and tell your auntie to run up 
 Shooters keep guns up, snitches get tongues cut 
 Talk to the peoples, and get your daughters and sons touched 
 I'm up in the chevy, we bangin' blow job Betty 
 I just whip up a 80, so hit my phone when you're ready 
 Turkey bag of the loud, we ain't fuckin' with reggie 
 Trump the trailer with pounds and touchdown out the jevy? 
 So c'mon! About to hit another Lick 
 'Bout a 150 bucks, for that tax on every zip 
 Gerber bottles of that lean, tax on every sip 
 'Cause they got the Qualitest and I got the Actavis 
 So I'm rollin' (rollin'), thizzin' off that molly 
 Stuntin' (Stuntin'), no hands on the Ducati 
 My big homie E-40 put me on the Carlos Rossi 
 I stay younger than the muscle 
 Got the game from Charlie Hustle 
 All my niggas really want the money 
 We don't want nothing else nigga I promise 
 All my niggas really want the money 
 All my niggas really want the money 
 Pockets will advance, clear the room 
 If the bitch ain't with the shit, then your boy don't approve 
 See, Hennessy, Bacardi turns the party 
 Backwoods pre-rolled, club get foggy 
 Niggas mean muggin', well leap then froggy 
 Though I see why you mad, her ass applauding 
 That's your bitch, she flip like dolphins 
 We gon' work out and bounce the bed springs 
 No credit cards, just debit and large cash 
 And a real big bag, smell like a forest 
 I used to sell weight till gastric bypass 
 Pass with a Mac that smack your car glass 
 Addicted to ballin', no Timbs, ate Wheaties 
 Learn from Doo Dog, he taught big gritty 
 King East Bay, E-40, boss leany 
 Money all there, your money Houdini
