I was born one day before Saint Pat 
 I guess a nigga miss luck just like that 
 Henry Ford, not even one mile from Motown 
 Explains all the soul that you hear in my sound 
 A ten minute ride to Linwood, I begun 
 My mama first son, look what I just become 
 A weed head with words more potent than what I'm smoking 
 This ain't no Reggie caught the plane ride from Oakland 
 I used to play with pistols in crack houses 
 Skipping school just to fuck bitches on dirty couches, abandoned houses 
 Find one with the lights on it 
 Landlord came pulled the hook, now it's locks on it 
 Money I'm plotting on it I put the block on it 
 I'm gonna get it, four deep, no shocks on it 
 We sit low, rep the D 'cause it's all I know 
 And my name rings bells in any hood you go 
 You're from the Eastside? (Eastside, Eastside) 
 You're from the Westside? (Westide, Westside) 
 You're from the North End? (North End, North End) 
 Is you from Southwest? (Southwest, Southwest) 
 You're from the Eastside? (Eastside, Eastside) 
 You're from the Westside? (Westide, Westside) 
 You're from the North End? (North End, North End) 
 Is you from Southwest? (Southwest, Southwest) 
 Around first grade, we move to the East Side 
 Was like throwing rocks at a beehive 
 A lot of niggas gone over something unimportant 
 That it ain't worth mentioning because it's unfortunate 
 Like stick a fork in it, where's the enforcement? 
 Walking off of Gratiot just to sit on niggas porches 
 Passing round forties, brown paper bags 
 Rolling up a swisher while this rat freak a black 
 It ain't about nothing, but let me hold something 
 Ate a lunchable for dinner, nigga I ain't fronting 
 Caught the bus to Eastland, just to walk around it 
 Ain't buy nothing nigga, just walked around it 
 Looked at some hoes, I ain't even holler 
 'Cause I'm broke as fuck and they is all about a dollar 
 I'm living in the city where the weak get swallowed 
 Belly of the beast, we don't care about tomorrow 
 I'm living in the city where the weak get swallowed 
 Belly of the beast, we don't care about tomorrow 
 So dog, you're from the Eastside? (Eastside, Eastside) 
 You're from the Westside? (Westide, Westside) 
 You're from the North End? (North End, North End) 
 Is you from Southwest? (Southwest, Southwest) 
 You're from the Eastside? (Eastside, Eastside) 
 You're from the Westside? (Westide, Westside) 
 You're from the North End? (North End, North End) 
 Is you from Southwest? (Southwest, Southwest)
