(Go, go, go, go, go, go) 
 Don't stop till you break it, break it 
 (Go, go, go, go, go, go) 
 Don't stop till you break it, break it 
 (Go, go, go, go, go, go) 
 Don't stop till you break it, break it 
 (Go, go, go, go, go, go) 
 Don't stop till you break it, break it 
 Who the fuck is you fucking with 
 I been in the dirt like a catcher's mitt 
 I'm activist on Actavis 
 Won't smack a bitch, but I'm like a pimp 
 Long-ass cutty, eating lots of shrimp 
 Got a wig and bring it back 
 She go in and bring it back 
 And make that booty go 
 Ain't no way gonna sleep with a whitey 
 Rob my nigga, ho so furry 
 Ghetto Bill Murray, that's a whole 'nother story 
 What a nightmare, when you see talking to your chick 
 Put this in your nose, ho, then start sniffing 
 Put this on your tongue, ho, then start licking 
 Y'all niggas shrooming, y'all better fall back 
 And my loud got niggas go 
 Ain't no time to be playing 
 Spit champagne when you hear what I'm saying 
 Exhale kush when I breathe on the mic 
 Every time I rock like a diamond heist 
 Drop the lights when I drop the jewel 
 Roll up bush and call it blue groovy 
 I'm just tryna say bring it back 
 Drop it down and go 
 With that work, we make it twerk 
 Don't end up on your homeboy's shirt 
 'Cause you popped you a pill 
 Now you feeling like a ho, now go berserk 
 I'm just tryna see her shake it 
 Shake it, don't stop girl, just break it, break it 
 Stick it out, then bring it back 
 Now make that booty go 
 (Go, go, go, go, go, go) 
 Don't stop till you break it, break it 
 (Go, go, go, go, go, go) 
 Don't stop till you break it, break it 
 Girl, just give me your all 
 Girl, just give me your all 
 Girl, just give me your all 
 Hell no, you can't have it all 
 Girl, just give me your all 
 Girl, just give me your all 
 Girl, just give me your all 
 Hell no, you can't have it all 
 She had me on that wall 
 Drink in my hand with her ass on my balls 
 Sweating, hot, and we rollin' 
 Phone off service, got a couple missed calls 
 Girl, don't stop just get it, get it, after this, ho, I'mma lick it, lick it 
 Rubbing on your stomach while I'm kissing on your neck 
 Thing getting hard while I'm rubbing on your breasts 
 Girl, you make me wanna do things 
 When you grind all on that ding-a-ling 
 Make me wanna rip off your pants 
 Put my hand between your legs 
 Rubbing on them nipples 
 Wanna make that pussy dribble 
 Wanna bend that ass over then hit it from the back 
 Girl make that booty go 
 With that work, we make it twerk 
 Don't end up on your homeboy's shirt 
 'Cause you popped you a pill 
 Now you feeling like a ho, now go berserk 
 I'm just tryna see her shake it, shake it 
 Don't stop girl, just break it, break it 
 Stick it out, then bring it back 
 Make that booty go 
 (Go, go, go, go, go, go) 
 Don't stop till you break it, break it 
 (Go, go, go, go, go, go) 
 Don't stop till you break it, break it 
 Girl, just give me your all 
 Girl, just give me your all 
 Girl, just give me your all 
 Hell no, you can't have it all
