Used to get domed up by crackheads 
 And still got my balls licked by pretty bitches 
 Sagging in Scottie Pippens, kid on a Gotti mission 
 But see his downfall, your best friend snitchin' 
 I'm in the kitchen with the Mac Spoon and lactose 
 Rat bitch rubbing on her titties off the roll 
 Nigga, calm down, listen for the door 
 I know my baby mama bet not call no more 
 Bitch talking Pampers, know she full of shit 
 Impossible for babies to take that many shits 
 Rapping 'bout bricks but I ain't never seen one 
 I think I seen like three hundred bowls once 
 Fucking with them addicts, holding automatics 
 Dog I ain't lying, even served a Dramatic 
 Used to bring the lettuce then I had to dead it 
 Ass tried to sing every time he wanted credit 
 And I'm tryna make re-up, fuck around, put a G up 
 And blow a blunt with my man's 
 See I'm just tryna make a re-up, fuck around, put a G up 
 And drink a fifth with my niggas 
 Christmas every year comes faster and faster 
 New Years come, claim a baby on your taxes 
 Dog I know connects, you middle-man taxing 
 Three gram dimes of weed, you was rocking Chloe glasses 
 Did it for the Jordans for what you feel important 
 In O2 my increased the dropout rate at Northern 
 See ya bitches skipping, get 'em weeded out 
 And take 'em to the back room, my nigga smut 'em out 
 Hood rat bitches puttin' blunts in they mouth 
 Smoke some weed, order Coney, time to fuck and out 
 Rock a fit for three days and go and cop a new one 
 Rode a bike to Linwood to give away my ones 
 Hopped up out the cab and when I step out 
 The first thing they say "I ain't know them came out" 
 But nigga I ain't tripping, I'm grinding on a few bucks 
 Really balling and I'm tryna step it up 
 And I'm tryna make re-up, fuck around, put a G up 
 And blow a blunt with my man's 
 See I'm just tryna make a re-up, fuck around, put a G up 
 And drink a fifth with my niggas
