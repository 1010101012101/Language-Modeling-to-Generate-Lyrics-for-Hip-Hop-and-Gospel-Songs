Chorus: Inspectah Deck vocal sample 
 Crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real... 
 Crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real... 
 Crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real... 
 Crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real... 
 Verse One: 
 The braggadocious MC has returned 
 To backdraft, torch niggas and burn 
 My sound moves like kilos underground 
 Cock me back, like a sledgehammer I'ma pound 
 Niggas into the ground like stakeness 
 This shit is fakeness, so I'ma break this 
 Monotony, and show 'em how it's supposed to be done 
 And keep lame niggas on the run 
 It's B-I-G S-H-U-G, try and remove me 
 Find yourself with loose teeth 
 And you can't stop the unstoppable 
 Niggas is droppable 
 When I'm coming through with my lyrical 
 I'm the ruffneck shwingin' 
 Drama that I'm bringin' 
 On your left jaw I'll be tingin' 
 Because left hooks turns mouths to mush 
 And when you're in my grip your whole game will be crushed... 
 Crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real... 
 To every hardcore that you hit the hard floor 
 Verse Two: 
 I'll slam an MC like cowboys do cattle 
 And rattle any snake mutha fucka who wish to battle 
 There's no way you can win 
 I'm wipin' off silly grins 
 When I come to kick your face in 
 And I'ma break you down to your atom 
 And if you test that, then I'ma grab one and bat 'em 
 Down to the ground with this sound 
 Stash your body parts and they're nowhere to be found 
 I'ma keep my mental on danger 
 Anger proves to you that I'm no stranger 
 And I'ma keep it real as I can 
 Comin' from Murderpan, who I am 
 I'm greater than, that means you're less than 
 Are you a man, I don't think so with gun in your hand 
 And I lived behind a wall 
 And when I was released Big Shug is still standing tall 
 Verse Three: 
 Comin' through with the cynderblock flows 
 Keepin' it dick-hard, while pussies wish to tiptoe 
 Through the valleys of death, troubles of hell 
 No matter how they gas me, head will never swell 
 I'm sending you up the river in a holey boat 
 And rippin' the sleeves off your lambskin coat 
 You wanna be tough well come test Shug 
 And you'll find out that my shit's all good 
 I represent to the fullest that's all I know 
 And I've got to come through swingin' elbows 
 And I'll hold the post, hold down the middle 
 And niggas get knocked the fuck out when they wanna fiddle 
 You gotta be serious, nothing is too mysterious 
 Niggaz is comin' with the truth 
 And my punchlines punch niggas offline 
 When I come through we represent every time
