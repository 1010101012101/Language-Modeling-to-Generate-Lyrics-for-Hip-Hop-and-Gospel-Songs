C'mon now - repeated 
 Got 'em up, yeah my Taliano, not many brothers is rollin' in Diablos 
 Hit the hard rock, the street is my work spot 
 I'm lookin' for females to cops (yeah) 
 Few things can past me, I'm rollin' up a five point O like pimps on ho, G 
 And I'm sittin' in third, I'm never on swerve, to the right I merge 
 Now I'm patrollin and I'm lookin' for a skirt in this thang I'm holding 
 I still got game ain't a damn thing change 
 I spot two Z's in the left lane 
 Eye contact is on, I'm rollin' down windows pointin at phones 
 And she's poppin' them buttons and yankin that blouse 
 Girl let it all out! 
 And that's what she did, baby ain't no kid 
 36 D's a make a man skid 
 I'm puttin' in work on the freeway pass 
 'Cause she put 'em on the glass (yeah) 
 (Break) - w/ ad libs 
 Put 'em on the glass ... 
 Put 'em on the glass, girl 
 Put 'em on the glass 
 Yes he's kinky, weenie and jinky 
 Got crush rock on his pinkie 
 He gets paid to stay laid 
 My copycats fade, evade to unpaid who's stay played 
 Girls when I'm on the freeway 
 Cats jumpin' in, givin' me leeway 
 And then drop them things on the dash 
 This Porsche is quick so don't try to run fast 
 At speed I got a need to see you breathe 
 And proceed with the kinky deeds 
 Indecent exposure can't hold ya, it's makin' you bolder 
 Cause baby is a Mix-A-Lot soldier 
 But love singers on pause 
 Everybody's beggin to get into your draws 
 What's makin' your kids frown? 
 +Baby Got Back+ or (shake it up and down) 
 You can follow me home cause this bone is on full blown 
 Straight grown all night long 
 I like my females nasty 
 Never try to drive straight past me 
 Just get in the left lane and show me your insane 
 And fill up the window with thangs 
 Puttin' niggaz on skids, jump out and straight crash 
 'Cause she put 'em on the glass 
 (Break) - w/ ad libs - (*scratched*) 
 How many times will you play this 
 Before your ban this, I heard Miss Gore can't stand this 
 But I gotta fan this, lovin' this scandalous rap 
 Guess who I got layin on the canvas 
 D-R R-I-C-H-A-R-D 
 Hard from the freeway party 
 Baby them things is workin 
 Fillin up the passenger window with Jergens 
 You hit the gas I'll hit mine too 
 Baby can I get with you? 
 Press the flesh till the glass gets dressed 
 Obsessed with the ways you express yourself 
 Some say I only rap about wealth 
 But baby can I talk about your health? 
 Lungs, lungs, motherfuckin lungs 
 Get a brother oh so strung 
 I'm lovin' this window dressing 
 The whole right lane is stressing 
 Offend me, offend me, you can freak me if your friendly 
 B double O B S, straight sittin' in the window 
 I'd rather kiss them than indo 
 And if you see me on the freeway, baby don't pass 
 Slow down and put 'em on the glass 
 (Break) - w/ ad libs 
 Put 'em on the glass 
 Put 'em on the glass, girl 
 Put 'em on the glass 
 Now shake them titties ... 
 Shake 'em ... 
 Put 'em on the glass ... 
 Put 'em on the glass
