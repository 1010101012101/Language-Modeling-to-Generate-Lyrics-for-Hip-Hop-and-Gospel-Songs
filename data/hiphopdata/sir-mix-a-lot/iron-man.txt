You could strike a match in my hand 
 Too black to tan 
 Heavy metal rhythm from a one man band 
 Bust my knuckles in a junkyard scuffle 
 Whippin adversaries with a brass belt buckle 
 Born in the ghetto 
 Hard like metal 
 Gotta '87 'vet with a fat gas pedal 
 Live a hard life 
 Shave wit a knife 
 Love to get freaky on the gloomiest nights 
 Got childhood scars 
 From the streets of my life 
 Girls laugh now they beggin to be mix'a'lots wife 
 A new breed is here vigilanties o' rap 
 Got eyes like fire wit my boys at my back 
 Now I'm back for revenge all the rumors must end 
 Quickie breathin is out 
 Whole music is in 
 Alot of dummies get paid just for clappin their hands 
 Not the style or desire of a true iron man 
 Ooh south side ruler 
 Don't drink cooler 
 Big money maker 
 Not a dumb drug user 
 Is real not drama 
 Paid pet llama 
 Met clint eastwood 
 Slapped his mama 
 Billboard thrilla 
 Avenue chilla 
 Hard rock lova and 
 Soft rock killa 
 Girls in the house 
 Watch yo blouse 
 I am the man yo moma was warnin you about 
 The bad boy of rap 
 Givin' no slack 
 Talk behind my back and 
 You might get slapped 
 You might get paid 
 But yo metal ain't real 
 Your metals like mush 
 This metals like steel! 
 Big E gold crushin 
 MC fussin 
 More lines in my face than a sunburnt russin 
 Hardly ever speakin' 
 Girls be tweakin 
 Buggin off the drums 'cause my snare be peakin 
 Worlds most hated 
 Too bad ta be graded 
 Makin' you mad 
 And I 'm elated 
 Beat syncopater 
 Your bad I'm greater 
 Tougher than swarchinager in terminater 
 Guitar chord ripper 
 Perrrier sipper 
 Transboard scratcher 
 And not a needle skipper 
 Fleash like steal 
 MC steal 
 Mickey dees shrimp salad not part of my meal 
 Heavy drum beginner 
 Can't stand kidders 
 Hate funk metal and not a bullshitter 
 Girlies wanna kiss 
 Suckas throwin' fists 
 Lotta rappas try ta rock but it ain't like this! 
 The iron man of rap droppin' the big metal, hammer! 
 Now that's true rap posse-up, yeah
