Got a real fine freek with a real big butt, 
 She gets real ill when she hears my cutt, 
 Got two cadaliacs one blue one gold, 
 Got straps on the front with a fresh set of folds, 
 Grill on the back and grill on the front, 
 24 carrot gold on my trunk, 
 Got a rope like a python hanging from my neck, 
 Got a freak in my arms cold kickin on the set, 
 Never get ill 'cause I'm two damn swats, 
 Got a funky trans-am with a duel igsaughts, 
 La is fine but seatle is my home, 
 Hood ornaments go 'cause I don't like chrome. 
 That's rippen 
 That's rippen 
 Chillin' never illin that's the place to be, 
 'Cause I'm a m-i-x-a-l-o-t,
