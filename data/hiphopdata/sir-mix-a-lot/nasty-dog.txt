Kitty cat, kitty cat, run, run, run 
 Kitty cat, kitty cat, run, run, run 
 Kitty cat, kitty cat run, run, run 
 I'm the dog in the Benz with the big chrome gun 
 Lookin' for a coochie proper 
 Hot mama, big dog, big game, no drama 
 Never make babies, can't get rabies 
 Makin' head hit and it's crazy 
 And when I catch a little kitty lookin' oh so tough 
 (Hmm) 
 Bring hot water, 'cause I might get stuck 
 Ew, while I'ma stop in Cosmo 
 'Cause my lyrical content is gando 
 Stickin' to the mind of the critics 
 I'm still with it, dogs gotta get it 
 (Hey, come here buddy) 
 Bow wow was the sound of the hound with the C town crown 
 I sniff around 'til I pin cats down 
 They like to run up trees 
 But I can bring 'em back down with a jingle of my car keys 
 Most men is dogs and most dogs is nasty 
 I can't let a cat run past me 
 Watch your skirt when you're walkin' through the mall 
 'Cause I ain't nothin', but a nasty dog 
 (Yeah) 
 (What kind of dog is this?) 
 Dog 
 (I ain't nothin') 
 But a nasty dog 
 (What kinda dog is this?) 
 What you want? 
 Can Mix come out to play? 
 Nasty bitch 
 So I'm back puttin' black kitty cats on their backs 
 Big macks never lag on wax, I'ma low down dog 
 I just stepped up and other dogs wanna flex up 
 I ain't tryna be the best rapper, just a big macker 
 So sit on down and watch the bank stacker 
 It still ain't easy G but this dog's a Bentley 
 So I'ma chase that cat, 'til I can't chase no mo' 
 There she goes in a drop top Rocko 
 What's up with your car sweetie? 
 Come on down and jump in the Black-ini 
 Another brother tryna diss and Mix ain't down 
 Oh no, hot sauce in my Dog Chow 
 Another brother can't see me but he wants to be me 
 I'm layin' these thangs on 'em freely 
 Now you got fo' fo' chromes, straight layin' on your dome 
 And get your mangy ass on 
 Back to the kitty, 'cause she's kinda pretty 
 I'm couldn't stop lookin' at her ta-ta-ta face 
 Me and cat mama rolled into the distant fog 
 Little did she know I'ma nasty dog 
 (Yeah) 
 (What kind of dog is this?) 
 Dog 
 (I ain't nothin') 
 But a nasty dog 
 (What kinda dog is this?) 
 (Old, stinky, rotten, ripe and old dog) 
 I'm slingin' that game like it ain't Jack 
 She's fat, black cat but she won't look back 
 Rollin' this Viper, tryna entice her 
 Don't need a front but I likes to 
 Get me an attitude, fightin' over who pulls up 
 Two dogs in a sports car, playin' old cuts 
 Turned down the James Brown 
 I said, "What's up girl", but she still won't turn around 
 Attitude, attitude 
 (What up, what's up) 
 When the girls are playin' the role and what do we do? 
 (Call 'em stuck up) 
 Now we're both tryna front like we don't care 
 Whip a u-turn to get a quick stare 
 But the face was hurtin' 
 (Damn) 
 The girl's grill was tore up, mustache wasn't workin' 
 Grandma old face with a norm ass body 
 Mack Daddy didn't want this hotty 
 Flashback to the cryin' game 
 I hate to see any parts of that poon-tang 
 Usually I'm quick to mack but that's road kill, back it up black 
 Quiz it, to giz it with the quick hiz 
 It's for zeeze it, tazease it 
 It's hard for me to leave it 
 Not sexist, just sexy with my dialog 
 'Cause I'ma nasty dog 
 (Yeah) 
 (What kind of dog is this?) 
 Dog 
 (I ain't nothin') 
 But a nasty dog 
 (What kinda dog is this?) 
 'Cause I'ma nasty dog 
 Yeah, dog 
 Nasty dog, nasty dog 
 Nasty dog, nasty dog
