 Three credit cards fulla fat (fat) clout 
 Fatass garage holdin' nine (nine) cars 
 One of them Mack Daddy rap (rap) stars

 Strip Mix-a-Lot straight down to the gristle (mm)

 Straight-up snitch tryin' to get Mix sw-ept

 Straight left a nigga AAAAAASSED OUT 
 Helicopters over my house (my house) 
 Takin' pictures of a brother in his draws wit his thing out (uh) 
 Livin' the life of a suspected crook 
 'Cause I never play the game by the book

 Cause the IRS,

 He starts scopin my house, havin' his doubts 
 About a brother with street AND bank clout 
 His partner was writin on a thick (thick) pad 
 Checkin' out the goodies that Mix (Mix) had 
 Trippin' off the things that I bought (bought) cash 
 Tryin' to send a brother up-state (state) fast 
 Yep (yep), livin' on the edge, I swear

 Ordered my books, now who's the real crooks? 
 On the streets, now I'm gettin' funny looks ('sup fool?)

 Stashed a lil' bread in the ninety-three 
 Bill collectors don't see me, G!

 To pull through all sorts of them tax ?odds?
