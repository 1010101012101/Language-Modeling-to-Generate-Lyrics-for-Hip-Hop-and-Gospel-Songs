"Tell 'about me baby" 
 Sweet brown shuga, that's what I call this female 
 Bad from the head to the motherfuckin' toenails 
 I ain't sprung, I'm just poppin' them facts' 
 Baby is a female mack yeahuhmm 
 Eyes that kill when the loc's are peeled 
 Takin' your money if your game ain't real 
 Known to keep the ass on propa (propa) 
 Never gettin' tickets from those horney-ass coppas 
 There she go, walkin' through the mall 
 4 inch pumps got her 6 feet tall 
 Switchin, 
 Ain't thinkin' 'bout stickin 
 Looking like she never seen a kitchen 
 Just broke up with her boyfriend (boyfriend) 
 Looking for a fool with a grip of ends (grip of ends) 
 Met one, boom, there he is 
 A rich young brotha in showbiz yeah 
 Big man, c.e.o. 
 6 double o are the letters on his benzo 
 Big mack daddy, bad to the bone 
 But 3 months later it's on 
 He done took her to the beach 
 Rubbed her feet 
 And bought baby girl a new jeep 
 Now she's gone, you can't buy love without game 
 But shuga gotcha lame 
 Sweet brown shuga "tell about me baby" 
 Sweet brown shuga "tell about me baby" 
 Sweet brown shuga "tell about me baby" 
 Sweet brown shuga "tell about me baby" 
 She's commin straigh outta Encino 
 Hittin football players for the c-notes (yep) 
 Picken' 'em, gittin' 'em, rarely ever kissin' 'em 
 Take 'em for the bank and then quiten' them 
 Went to the Raiders game and spotted this 
 Black quarterback with a big fat contract 
 Now she's on the visitors side line 
 The mackin' is on when the coach calls time 
 Quick work, gotta do it slick so 
 Do it while the Raiders is kick'n they field goal 
 Put the number on the bottom of a cup 
 "The kick is up... it's good!" 
 Later that night relaxin' 
 The quarterbacks thinkin' he's waxen' 
 But naa the typical line 
 "I just don't think it's the right time" (what???) 
 Ask yourself, who's the mack 
 Baby starts buyin' moneysacks 
 'Cause when the fool got to the next city 
 Western Union straight got busy 
 4 G's a week and now baby got a condo sittin' in Redondo 
 So the quarterback calls 'cause he wanna get naked 
 "Beep beep beep" disconnected 
 I'll tell ya son, just because you can bench press 
 Don't put ya past this test 
 You got pimped like a straight-up sap 
 Paid money cause you sprung on the cat (huh) 
 Bought 35 G's and now your through 
 Never got near the boots 
 See ya, but I never would've been ya 
 Sweet brown shuga done went up in ya 
 "Tell about me baby" sweet brown shuga 
 "Tell about me baby" sweet brown shuga 
 "Tell about me baby" sweet brown shuga 
 "Tell, tell about me baby" 
 Baby starts going to the wheight room 
 That's trouble, add more curve to the bubble 
 The rump is pumped ready for battle 
 Caught the next plane to Seattle 
 Welcome to the 206 
 She's lookin' for the brotha named Mix 
 Jumped in a rental car rolled to the hood 
 Brown shuga's up to no good 
 Got my digit's, gave me a call 
 Have no fear, Mix-A-Lot don't fall 
 "Riinnnngggg- yeah, who this?" 
 "38-24-38 Mix" 
 Cliped on my pager, grabed my cellular 
 Eeny meeny miney mo and picked the number 8 car 
 Now I'm rollin' in my NSX thinkin' I'ma get some "koo-chee" 
 Met her at the mini-mart, she was in an Escort 
 I'm kinda thinkin' 'bout contact sports 
 When we get back to the Mix house 
 I'm knockin' that kitty cat out!
