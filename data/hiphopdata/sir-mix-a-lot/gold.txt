Gold around his neck (8 ball rollin') 
 Gold around his neck (24-7) 
 Gold around his neck (8 ball rollin') 
 Gold around his neck (14k heaven) 
 Clockin' lots of dollars cruisin in his benz 
 Clockin' lots of dollars got no place to go 
 Clockin' lots of dollars rollin' with your posse 
 Clockin' lots of dollars we all got gold 
 Listen up brothers it's the rhyme I can't repeat 
 I'm sportin more gold than a rock 'n' roll freak 
 Mix is my name bustin' rhymes is my game 
 Don't direspect me 'cause I kill then I take your chain 
 Life is pretty tough yet goes kinda rough 
 Stealin and your dealin' but you just can't get enough 
 Now your crying cause my rope is 20mm fat 
 Your stealin gold emblems down at fredrick cadillac 
 Walking round san fran rippin up the set 
 Homeboys on the corner ask us where we rock next 
 I'm not in town to smoke joe if you broke you kid 
 We're back in san fransisco and we're looking for the gold 
 Saw the rock man and we tail his benz 
 He drove pile street to where the charlie cars end 
 He sipped his soda pop, came to a complete stop 
 Looked over to the left it was a... gold shop 
 Yo baby check out this big gold nugget ring 
 Walked into the shop and I had to stare 
 This freak was in the corner with the long blond hair 
 I knocked her out the way 'cause she was standin in my vision 
 I saw this gold rope and my haragi started fishin 
 Walked up to the counter and we hit the bell 
 We all had money for the big gold sale 
 From back behind the counter came the big gold mines 
 Last name, kinda funny, but his first name was Jahan 
 Put your money down that's nothing to me 
 Got the real rockman buying me jewelry 
 So they acting like a 20 in americanly 
 The AMG kick on my 516 mercedes 
 So I reached into my pocket and I pulled thick bank 
 I would of bought the store but my bank just sank 
 I know I got points cause my gold shines bright 
 Gonna sport it to the solar system Saturday night 
 My haragi's up next for the big gold deal 
 Flipped them presidents and cold got ill 
 Smile on his face with a grand in his hand 
 Bought a turkish gold rope with the 30 inch span 
 Kid sensation was the next at bat 
 Bought a big nugget watch face up a cadillac 
 He saw this gold rope and said how much for that jikoby 
 Told him 700 dollars everbody said owwwwww 
 So gary kid came over as the kid count bank 
 Gave him 14 50's and his face stayed blank 
 I grabbed the sack of gold and Jahan, we told 'em bye 
 We'd like to stay and kick it but we can't we gotta fly 
 Break 
 We left the gold shop kinda broke but happy 
 Promoter put us up in an '86 caddy 
 Cross the golden gate and headed for the napa valley 
 No liter in the car because we threw it in the alley 
 Everybody's trippin' off of mix a lot's crew 
 Pose fresh dipped all feelings are blue 
 Caddy pushin 80 like a big black rocket 
 We're looking for a pose with no money in their pockets 
 We made a right turn there's the pose on the left 
 Before we get baby just remember we're def 
 My haragi took the bank roll Larry took the car 
 Kid Sensation had a plan thinking he was a superstar 
 Step aside kid I control this jam 
 You are my partner and here's my scam 
 I'll take the homeboys you take the skeezer 
 The boys got gold but they ain't got filas 
 Larry made a move with the black briefcase 
 5000 dollars worth a fila in your face 
 They ain't got money but they had a lot of dope 
 I said I don't want drugs just give me your rope 
 To sell a suitcase of filas boy it ain't no thing 
 Just give me that gold that includes all rings 
 My haragi snatched the gold out the homegirls nose 
 Man we would of took her bra if the sucka was gold
