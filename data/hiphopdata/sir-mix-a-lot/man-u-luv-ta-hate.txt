Y'all bustas just don't know 
 Y'all can't get with the Mix-A-Lot show 
 The man you love to hate ain't phased by the fakes 
 If you want to playa hate, eat a big 'ole snake 
 It's the man you love to hate 
 The J.R. Ewing of Seattle 
 It's the man you love to hate 
 The J.R. Ewing of Seattle 
 It's the man you love to hate 
 The J.R. Ewing of Seattle

 I can memorize your number but I still don't know your name 
 The conservatives are thinking, I'm a pimp 
 Just because I kind of stroll with a limp 
 But I still got love for the few who stayed down 
 But some of my ex's ain't around, why is that? 
 'Cause the rock, man, got them and their butt's just dropped 
 They started losing weight, their grill's looking shot 
 So I switched her, I'm steadily keepin' 'em mixed up 
 I'm keeping, down and holding my crown and giving them hiccups 
 Boo hooing when you call me but we was playing 
 On each other so you are wrong, see, sitting around anti-nails 
 Your disputing my sales, fantasizing 'bout counting my mail 
 It's the man you love to hate 
 The J.R. Ewing of Seattle 
 It's the man you love to hate 
 The J.R. Ewing of Seattle 
 It's the man you love to hate 
 The J.R. Ewing of Seattle 
 It's the man you love to hate

 Lady listen, do I really make your man that pissed? 
 Flipped it around and tell your man like this 
 If you hate Mix, than why you talk about Mix? 
 You say, you ain't a trick but you trippin', so she's splittin' 
 Now she's coming out to Mrs. Ponderosa 
 She drove a beater so I heard her getting closer 
 She got an old V-Dub, Volkswagen with the damaged exhaust 
 But she was fine, so I figured I could toss 
 And watch the 808 kick drum, makes this girlie get dumb 
 She's grabbing on my bum tryin' to get one 
 And I'm taxing, waxing, I gotta take a note 
 Farted on the down stroke 
 Playa's in the house can you feel me 
 Got these playa haters lookin' at me silly 
 But with this mouthpiece a brother's gotta win 
 The ladies say you are fine, but your mackin' is kind of thin 
 No more Broadway, I'm hollering Rainier 
 Swoop around blocks dropping windows yelling, "Come Here" 
 And you complain 'cause I mad a little change 
 It's all in the game, boy to hell with the fame 
 It's the man you love to hate 
 The J.R. Ewing of Seattle 
 It's the man you love to hate 
 The J.R. Ewing of Seattle 
 It's the man you love to hate 
 The J.R. Ewing of Seattle

 I got my buck on them rolling down to Cali, I got a brand new home 
 Out in the valley, jumping off I-5, I crack a left-eye got to pick my homey up The attitude adjuster, seven in a jet black truck 
 With a deaf black G-Lock 
 In case we out of luck, 'cause with these haters you gotta keep your strap 
 'Cause we taking all their sugars now they tryin' to take us back, yep 
 So you got your and I got mine 
 So why do you whine about my grind? 
 Sitting around blaming Mix-a-Lot for your situation 
 Boy get a job and quit player hatin' 
 It ain't about winning your respect 
 I'm just checking more mail than you check 
 So heres the finger next to my index 
 I'm all about your lady 'cause she's all about the sizex, sex 
 It's the man you love to hate 
 The J.R. Ewing of Seattle
