The smoke looks like chemtrails every time I exhale 
 Entrails trail when I'm impaled 
 There's a red pale moon that I set sail to 
 Two sides when I lie on the bed nails 
 There's bugs in the breadbox blades in my cereal 
 Trivial these days are arterial 
 Speak from the heart arterial 
 Art theory so ethereal star chart dreary 
 So hear me go so indigo in winter solstice 
 No Rigmarole just rigor mortis 
 Mix 'em all with a warhead 
 Inner-torment intervals of misfortune 
 I'm in a different orbit 
 Bits of the pigeonhole I'm in is gorgeous 
 Never get into the fortress 
 Orchestras in my mind play a chorus 
 Paint a portrait emcee MC Escher 
 Go hand to hand then draw arms slow 
 Yea I got my lows I was high & dry 
 'Til the water rose now I water roses (Watch 'em grow) 
 Every god I've known is dead 
 I walk alone instead 
 Steady monochrome I'm sketching 
 Sketchy scenes with no regrets bet 
 My eyes dialate 
 I'm leaving soon no dying late 
 I'm wide awake 
 To greet the moon with tidal waves 
 I'm just molecules in motion 
 A product of explosions in the sky 
 Find the stardust I'm composed of 
 These waves 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 These lines 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 These waves 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 These lines 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 These waves 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 These lines 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 I'm just molecules in motion 
 I'm just going through the motions 
 I'm just gliding 
 I'm just flying by 
 I'm just riding my 
 Homemade handmade instrument 
 To guide me through the eye 
 Hope to come out dry, other side 
 I'm just trying to find the words 
 Trying to lose 'em in the curves 
 Trying to prove I'm not trying to prove shit 
 But that's absurd 
 Once I tried to cast a spell for love 
 But tries a stretch 
 Didn't have the time for the witchy shit 
 Onto the next 
 Never got a badge for patience, shit 
 Or really anything they ever make a badge about 
 But I never ever tried to fit they vision 
 And that's really the only kind of shit I'm trying to brag about 
 These waves 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 These lines 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 These waves 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 These lines 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 These waves 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 These lines 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 These waves 
 Fuck up the unknown 
 These lines 
 Fuck up the unknown
