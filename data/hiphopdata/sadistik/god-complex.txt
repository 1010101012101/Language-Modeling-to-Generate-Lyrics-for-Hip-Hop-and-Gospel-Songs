Get on my level for real, get on my level 
 Get on my level for real, get on my level 
 Yeah 
 The apparitions appear they're up here 
 My conditions impaired 
 Now our positions to peer on our peers 
 My visions in pairs 
 Apparently people still think I'm a poet 
 A freak and I know it 
 Afraid I'm a fraud, I'm a leech, I'm a rodent 
 Taking the hearts of the people opposed 
 Feast or be feasted it's beating for beats & I know 
 I'm a beast and it shows I'ma show 'em my teeth 
 At least that I know I'm the least 
 These people are so in between more like social disease 
 So fuck their retweets and fuck the like 
 I've come to defeat and cut the ties 
 I don't vie for dumb I become divine 
 Will I my sacrifice my sun to shine? 
 Watch 'em revel in this shit, watch 'em revel in this shit 
 Devil on the left 
 Watch 'em revel in this shit, watch 'em revel in this shit 
 Devil on the right 
 Watch 'em revel in this shit, watch 'em revel in this shit 
 Devil on the left 
 Watch 'em revel in this shit, watch 'em revel in this shit 
 What level did you get? 
 I got a god up here, I got a god up here 
 What you got up here? 
 I got a god up here, I got a god up here 
 What you got? 
 I got a god up here, I got a god up here 
 What you got up here? 
 I got a god up here, I got a god up here 
 What you got? 
 I'm the god of gods 
 All are lost, Holocausts 
 All accosted for hollow cause 
 Throw Molotovs don't call the cops 
 We're slowly dying and waterlogged 
 Don't baptize me in alcohol 
 Or choke and tie me I'm nodding off 
 Throw tomahawks at those bla-bla-blas 
 Like... Yeah I don't wanna talk to you 
 Like... And I don't want a talking to 
 Since I can't fit sins in stanzas 
 Ill sit in absence and sip the absinthe 
 My hippocampus can hit the canvases 
 Is this disenchantment? 
 Watch 'em revel in this shit, watch 'em revel in this shit 
 Devil on the left 
 Watch 'em revel in this shit, watch 'em revel in this shit 
 Devil on the right 
 Watch 'em revel in this shit, watch 'em revel in this shit 
 Devil on the left 
 Watch 'em revel in this shit, watch 'em revel in this shit 
 What level did you get?
