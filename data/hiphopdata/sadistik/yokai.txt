Okay okay okay I see Yokai everywhere I go 
 Okay okay okay I see Yokai everywhere I go 
 Everywhere I go there is snow 
 Life is so unfair I know 
 Lady Snowblood bitching at me 
 I'm unbearable 
 Like Ivan The Terrible 
 Both her eyes are peridots 
 Sometimes I wanna tear 'em out 
 They stare into my barren soul 
 Assuming I'm Asami, Audition 
 (Eerie, eerie, eerie) 
 Let me put some needles on your skin 
 (Kiri, kiri, kiri) 
 On that Hara-Kiri feeling Irreversible 
 Extinguisher to skull 
 Watch me wrap these fingers around my throat 
 I say, I say 
 Okay okay okay I see Yokai everywhere I go 
 Okay okay okay I see Yokai everywhere I go 
 Slinking through Shibuya 
 Singing Hallelujah 
 Drinking sake 
 Thoughts are black, I'm all Yakuza 
 Ichi with the itchy finger 
 My medullas on Medusa 
 Twist 'em up like Kama Sutra 
 Karma suits you 
 Onibabas follow me like Onimusha 
 Okay okay okay I see Yokai everywhere I go 
 Okay okay okay I see Yokai everywhere I go
