(Verse 1 - Sadistik) 
 Ayo I'm starting to face that a part of me's fake 
 And everything that they say is just hard to relate 
 And then it (ends quick) and it starts to decay 
 Until my (friendship) is a part of the phase 
 And I, can't pre-tend, can't stand these trends 
 Can't stand weak friends that have pretense 
 Sad can't stand back at that deep end 
 And now I see that I don't need friends 
 And I feel like a modern day patriot 
 With a mind of a God and a hearth of an atheist 
 God's love is a conjugal visit 
 'Cause you just get fucked while you're locked in a prison 
 My passion's emphatic (its mixed with) tragic romantic (instances) 
 Sadness and hazards (six six six) havoc that crafted (Sadistik) 
 An eye for an eye and a tooth can trade 
 Then you turn the other cheek till the bruises fade 
 If you lose an eye, lose a tooth and lose a cheek 
 Then your religion is losing face 
 When I vacate, to a sanctity 
 To a safe place, that was made for me 
 And I placate, all my atrophy 
 Then I won't say faith, isn't made for me 
 I walk (a fragile path), of thought (and habitats) 
 I've lost (and can't have back) across (the aftermath) 
 Of befriendin' each sentence, endin' 
 Retention defense and tension 
 Repentance needs ventin' when in 
 Dependent deep ended friendship 
 Followed first on a path of hollow verse 
 Solemn words that were both spoke but not emerged 
 Gotta learn that I gotta get through autumn first 
 Follow dirt that is gonna let the God occur 
 Read your bible (script the verses) 
 Stand for nothing (but sit at service) 
 Find the meaning (but miss the purpose) 
 Read in depth (but you get the surface) 
 Some say, Ill have to be synthetic, to get my quotes red (read) like your Jesus said it 
 Some day, Ill form opinion, either stand up to God or fall for religion 
 The road you cross, isn't quite a crossroad 
 Your bible's lines signify a barcode 
 And I'll go, put a rhyme to reason 
 'Cause Nietzche said "god is dead" and I believe him!
