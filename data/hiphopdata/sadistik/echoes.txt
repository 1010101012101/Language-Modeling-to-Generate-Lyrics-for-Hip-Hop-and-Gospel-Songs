I can be the seed your hands planted in vain 
 I can splatter paint till it supplanted the sprains 
 I can see the sun is just a planet in flames 
 Dad's not here to see his son planned it in vain 
 Tell me I'm a sinner but maybe you're not a saint 
 I've yet to find a god to save me from all this pain 
 All I hear are echoes whenever I call his name 
 I try to change my ways but lately it's all the same 
 Tidal waves in veins will make me erode away 
 Voices in my brain all say that they're so afraid 
 Aching for the angels to grace me with Novocain 
 I'll pray for supernovas to blow up this hopeless place 
 My skull's a weight my head is so full of shame 
 I wear a mask still everyone knows my name 
 I stare in black and wish I could float away 
 I wish I could go today I'm kissing 'em all goodbye, look 
 Time echoes dimly in my mind 
 Can I get a rewind 
 Light echoes dimly in my mind 
 Can I get a rewind 
 I can make a landfill out of a flower patch 
 I can change a Daffodil into a power plant 
 I can take what's perfect and burn it all down to ash 
 Modify my mind till serpents all turn to glass 
 Toxify environments I'm in a state of flux 
 Quite a ways away and trying to stay afloat 
 Life can fade away in moments we wasted huh? 
 I tried to change my ways but nobody gave a fuck, look 
 Time echoes dimly in my mind 
 Can I get a rewind 
 Light echoes dimly in my mind 
 Can I get a rewind
