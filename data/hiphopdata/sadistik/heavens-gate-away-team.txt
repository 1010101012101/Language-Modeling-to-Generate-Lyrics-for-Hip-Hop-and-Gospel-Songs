Phenobarbital mixed with apple sauce and vodka 
 Who needs rationale when they ration out the dogma 
 Promises of gods in their passages of karma 
 Mr. Applewhite can turn the average to a martyr 
 Purple jumpsuits with the patches on the left 
 39 aftermaths happened in those beds 
 39 had to gasp canceling their breath 
 From the 39 plastic bags wrapped around their heads 
 Deliver us from deliverance 
 Gimme gimme love or barbiturates 
 Itchy trigger fingers going numb from the bitterness 
 They said I'll never fade 
 Just enter Heaven's Gate 
 Truth is always hiding in the darkest spot 
 And you can probably find it where the monsters are 
 Billions of people follow the same dream 
 Save me from Heaven's Gate away team 
 Truth is always hiding in the darkest spot 
 And you can probably find it where the monsters are 
 Billions of people follow the same dream 
 Save me from Heaven's Gate away team 
 I am not a god, I am not Allah 
 I am not of law, I will not applaud 
 I am violent, I am not to laud 
 Nodding off, flying higher than the cosmonauts 
 Write it like Nabokov, light it like a Molotov 
 We tried to call to arms confide and watch the stars 
 We lied and crossed our hearts to promise we'd be different 
 Threw our sins at God in synagogues, in a fog of demagogues 
 Get macabre and substitute a slaughter for religion 
 Yeah we say it's not of our volition 
 Then call on God to fix it but it's fiction 
 Crucifixion, dying off just to conquer our addictions 
 Dyatlov pass incident lost in our own winters 
 They wait in vain for a cosmic intervention 
 And save the pain just to lock it in a prison 
 I stay awake with the monsters I've been given 
 They said I'll never fade 
 Just enter Heaven's Gate 
 Truth is always hiding in the darkest spot 
 And you can probably find it where the monsters are 
 Billions of people follow the same dream 
 Save me from Heaven's Gate away team 
 Truth is always hiding in the darkest spot 
 And you can probably find it where the monsters are 
 Billions of people follow the same dream 
 Save me from Heaven's Gate away team
