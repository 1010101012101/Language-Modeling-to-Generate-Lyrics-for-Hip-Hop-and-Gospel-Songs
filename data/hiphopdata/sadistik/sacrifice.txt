I don't bow down to their idols 
 I won't kowtow till I'm idle 
 When they count down to the bible 
 Then they found out that we're rivals 
 I know revelations the devil made 
 Seven angels and seven plagues 
 Rivers all run red with blood 
 From hellish sun to heaven's gate 
 They drink, drink 
 His wine in the processions 
 Then they sink, sink 
 Inside of their own blessings 
 Guess that holy water wasn't meant for me 
 No those martyrs aren't dead for me 
 I told my momma it's destiny 
 We'll soar together and sort through winters 
 And so in turn it's sores and blisters from leprosy 
 They fall apart but they never see 
 Fall so hard just to follow arcs 
 Bawl so hard can you please remind me? 
 Why these tears are blinding 
 I can't see your light 
 These peers of mine still think their fears will find me 
 Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you 
 Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you 
 Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you 
 No gods, I know no gods 
 Thirteen years old my soul was saved 
 I prayed to god the devil goes away 
 Never go astray when I know the way 
 Two wings bloomed from my shoulder blades 
 Too weak to get to hold the blade 
 And make a sacrifice but I won't obey 
 My woes can stay my own today 
 No mitosis psychosis won't let me call unto ya, call unto ya 
 Hallelujah, hallelujah 
 Don't go let that hallow lure ya 
 Don't forget that solitude 
 They honor you with their presence 
 Then threaten you with his prescience 
 They bought all you with their presents 
 First they thread the needle, then press in 
 Precious present day possessions 
 All answers no questions 
 All answer no lessons unless it's all hands on decadence 
 What's next to lend? 
 I don't want to kill my next of kin 
 Or feel their fingers on my neck again 
 What'd I ex for lent, your excellence 
 I'm dead, come get it 
 Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you 
 Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you 
 Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you 
 No gods, I know no gods 
 Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you 
 Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you 
 Sacrifice your gods before your gods sacrifice you 
 No gods, I know no gods
