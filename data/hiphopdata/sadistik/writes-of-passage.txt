(Verse 1 - Vast Aire) 
 So what you runnin' from? 
 Oh those cats on the corner they hella dumb 
 That's why I'm done with standage 
 I'll bite your face and make a sandwich 
 Now you actin' like you don't know 
 This is just usual, show 'em my judo throw 
 Oh no, your rap styles finished 
 How you playin' Popeye with E coli spinach? 
 Ok, lets slow down 
 'Cause you are not prepared for the speed of sound 
 Don't let the beast run his mouth 
 When the Aire came through, they skated out 
 I used to cry out why (why!) 
 'Cause like Scott Summers, I couldn't open my eyes 
 'Cause everyone would die 
 If I took one peek, everyone would fry 
 (Verse 2 - Sadistik) 
 My appetites for sitting in cityscapes in black and white 
 Crackin' light Smittys I'm shitty faced to crash at night 
 The passive type, who's a lost pathetic dreamer 
 Terrified to be a victim with a walking dead demeanor 
 I'm coughing emphysema, caught in coffins in between 
 A cautious innocence while listening to Andre Nikatina 
 If you could trace my steps a couple minutes 
 Huh, if I get crossed you fall like London bridges 
 I do this for pot heads playin' sick as a teen 
 And insomniacs who still will raise a fist for the dream 
 For Street Fighter 2 and David Lynchian scenes 
 For Tupac Shakur and Rage Against the Machine 
 I'm a cynical, profitable, raw syllables I'll spit at you 
 Similar to the kid named Rakim will do 
 I'm identical to that of Pac's mental too 
 I rock spiritual without a break or stop interval 
 I'm from the state where the rain will never stop 
 Hendrix was from and Cobain perfected rock 
 A place seagulls land where the space needle stands 
 And fuck Bush stickers decorate people's vans 
 I watch the wind blow, leaves caught in limbo 
 Tiptoe past the season's frosty skin tone 
 Seein' glossy crystals, I try and catch it 
 Describe it all inside my Writes of Passage
