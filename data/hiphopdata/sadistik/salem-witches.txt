 You're stealing my high killing my vibe 
 I cannot kill what I'm feeling inside 
 Villain for life Lord of the Flies 
 King of the night kingdom of spite 
 More of the blind leading the blind 
 Circle of fire I'm feasting my eyes 
 Seek and you'll find I dream I'm alive 
 There's gotta be more than this ceiling and blinds 
 I'm all in my head 
 But never ahead 
 So off with their heads 
 Took a shot in the dark and they offered me lead 
 Like I'ma make you immolate 
 On a stake pit of snakes 
 Watch 'em all disintegrate 
 Salem witch isn't it great? 
 Say it with us burn it down 
 Salem witches burn it down 
 Say it with us 
 Burn it down burn it down burn it down 
 Say it with us burn it down 
 Salem witches burn it down 
 Say it with us 
 Burn it down burn it down burn it down 
 Fire the liars I'm high off the toxins 
 Light to a moth flies to a carcass 
 These are the parts that I hide in my cartilage 
 Starter kit to carcinogens 
 When our religions's art and sin 
 Artisan of darkness a heart with pins 
 Pick apart our symptoms chart the difference 
 Char who's different and charge admission 
 I'm necromancer 
 High as fuck watching Nekromantik 
 Cut the lights for the devil's magic 
 Blood of Christ let's get romantic 
 Kept my anger Kenneth Anger 
 Anchored down by my bangles drowned in the banks 
 Ain't heard the angels now 
 They earned all their urns I'ma take 'em out 
 Like its eeny-meeny-miney-moe 
 Feed me any type of dope 
 Life is cold but I can cope 
 There's ice inside my isotopes 
 So where did all the air go? 
 Ergo I'm a scarecrow heart on my arm compliments my apparel 
 Lost in the marrow lock stock and barrel 
 Bare all till it's off to the pharaohs 
 Rosemary's baby in blackest of bassinets 
 Souls buried deep in a casket I asked for it 
 How many times can a man shake the hand of a mannequin? 
 Plastic abandon the sacrament 
 Out of it, adamant, animate, acidic 
 Any old adjective turn 'em to ash for it 
 Say it with us burn it down 
 Salem witches burn it down 
 Say it with us 
 Burn it down burn it down burn it down 
 Say it with us burn it down 
 Salem witches burn it down 
 Say it with us 
 Burn it down burn it down burn it down 
 Life from the other side 
 Light can become a fire 
 Like die motherfucker die 
 In a blind world it's an eye for another eye 
 Life from the other side 
 Light can become a fire 
 Like die motherfucker die 
 In a blind world it's an eye for another eye 
 Eye for another eye 
 Eye for another eye 
 Eye for another eye 
 Everybody know it's an eye for another eye 
 Eye for another eye 
 Eye for another eye 
 Eye for another eye 
 Everybody know it's an eye for another eye
