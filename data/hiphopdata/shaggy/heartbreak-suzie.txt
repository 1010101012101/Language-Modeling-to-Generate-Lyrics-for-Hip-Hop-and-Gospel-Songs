 Wasn't it you who left me alone 
 Wasn't it you who called me on the phone 
 Wasn't it you who wrecked my home 
 Wasn't it you who wanted life alone 
 You must be crazy (you must him mottle) 
 To still want to be my lady 
 You must be crazy (mm) 
 To still want to be my lady, hey 
 I know now fi tell her say, ha 
 You said you wanted a break up 
 Your love was a fake 
 There was a mistake made 
 You said you wanted a break up 
 Your love was a fake 
 There was a mistake made 
 I reminisce about the time we had just me and you 
 And how much days and nights we spent upon that lonely cruise 
 You were the only one for me I bet I could not lose 
 And out of many beautiful women you are the one I choose 
 To love and honor and protect and even say "i do" 
 But then you wanted us to part and that's when I refused 
 But still you left anyway and suddenly I had the blues 
 Now here's a the pass and no one else could ever fill your shoes 
 You sending me up bringing me down got my head just spinning around 
 Come on in get on out baby why you wanna go that route 
 Say you must be crazy (hey girl you must have giddy) 
 To still want to be my lady, yeah (mr lover, come back to me, ha) 
 Nothing in this world could extinguish my flames 
 You are the only one I wanted to bare my name 
 All of a sudden I notice you playing mind games 
 Giving me migraine so much emotional pain 
 You were the one and no one else could make that claim 
 It's a shame to see the relationship down the drain 
 Now you want us back together and it won't be the same 
 What your aim is it to cause me more pain 
 Heartbreak suzie playing with my mind (mm) (mmm) 
 Heartbreak suzie don't you waste my time (you're wasting my time) 
 Heartbreak suzie playing with my mind yey (step a fall and beat) 
 Heartbreak suzie don't you waste my time
