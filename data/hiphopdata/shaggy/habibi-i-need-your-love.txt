I need your love, I need your love, 
 I need your love! 
 I need your love, I need your love, 
 I need your... 
 I need your love, I need your love, 
 I need your love! 
 Let me love you! 
 If I love ya, love me right back, 
 The kind of love that keep you coming back. 
 If I love ya, love me right back, 
 Don't ever leave me, girl, don't do me that! 
 So, please stay, don't walk away, 
 Gimme another chance, me love you the right way, 
 My true feelings pushing on, 
 Woman, you love me, can't do without. 
 Who am I without you by my side? 
 Every little piece of my heart broken in the dark 
 Wishing I could hold you now. 
 When you were here for me, 
 I was not there for you, 
 I was too blind, 
 Couldn't see what you did for me, 
 Now I don't know what to do. 
 Ladi ladi, ram tam, ladi ladi, ram tam, 
 I'll be right here for you. 
 Ladi ladi, ram tam, ladi ladi, ram tam, 
 I'll be calling out for you, can you hear me? 
 I need your love, I need your love, 
 I need your love! 
 I need your love, I need your love, 
 I need your... 
 I need your love, I need your love, 
 I need your love! 
 Let me love you! 
 Let me love you! 
 And every time that you think to leave, 
 I'll be, 'Don't, don't, don't, don't go!' 
 And every time that you think of me, 
 I'll want your big bright smile just go. 
 There's no one else but you, girl, 
 And when me look at me future, see you, girl! 
 My true feelings pushing on, 
 Woman, you love me, can't do without. 
 I need your love, I need your love, 
 I need your love! 
 I need your love, I need your love, 
 I need your... 
 I need your love, I need your love, 
 I need your love! 
 Let me love you! 
 Let me love you! 
 I need your love, I need your love, 
 I need your love! 
 I need your love, I need your love, 
 I need your... 
 I need your love, I need your love, 
 I need your love! 
 Let me love you!
