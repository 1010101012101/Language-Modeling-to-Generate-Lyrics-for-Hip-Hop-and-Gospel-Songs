(Shaggy) 
 Now I got to give this one a whole lot a love 
 And this one goes out to them on a world wide tip 
 Let them know that Beres Hammond is definitely 
 Here to spread nothing but love 
 Love for the world and love for the nation... 
 A little bit a love in Herzegovina 
 A little bit a love a spread it in Jamaica 
 A wanna little bit a love in America 
 And let them know 
 Take time to love, take time to love 
 Take time to love, take time to love 
 All the boys in New York City 
 And all the dreads in London City 
 And all the militant ones in Lebanon 
 All the way over there in Japan 
 Push up your hands 'cause you understand 
 Now put a permanent pause on hate 
 Let's get it on 
 Chorus (repeat) 
 Oh if you really feel it then sing 
 You got it you got it 
 Just for the record can I hear it again 
 Oh there it is there it is there it is 
 Take time to love 
 You got it you got it 
 There it is there it is yes 
 All the big bad dan dan dadas 
 Cool the vibes in sweet Jamaica 
 I know it's rough but we're still 
 Hanging on oh yeah 
 Settle the war on Herzegovina 
 Listen rhythm and rock and come in ya 
 Why can't we all just get along It's the time 
 Take time to love If you really feel it then sing 
 You got it you got it yeah 
 Just for the record can I hear it again 
 Oh God there it is there it is 
 Lets make some love take time to love
