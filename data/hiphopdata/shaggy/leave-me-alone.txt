I know he's home 
 I just seen him go in 
 He's really trying to play me 
 Where he be, it's just over like that 
 It just ain't that easy 
 Trust me, I am not the one 
 Hmm hmm hmm hmm 
 Whatever, I got all night 
 Go figure how you turned out 
 To be a real gold digger 
 What you don't care 
 Should draw the picture bigger 
 You ain't my main squeeze 
 It's five in the morning 
 Why you calling my phone 
 Keep the sweater, just leave me alone 
 No more love letters 
 Gotta play myself 
 'Cause I should have known better 
 "Hello, hello" 
 Just leave me alone 
 Stop calling my phone 
 Quit invading my home 
 Why don't you leave me alone 
 (Repeat twice) 
 What a bummer 
 Met this girl on South Beach last summer 
 Mummy got back, but she ain't no stunner 
 Chat for a while and I had a few drinks 
 Well the next thing you know 
 We were fogging up the Hummer 
 Now the chick's banging on my door like a hammer 
 Stalking my house, big tap like a plumber 
 Couldn't keep myself 'cause 
 I thought with my brain, I would haveleft her alone 
 She got laced, the opportunity was right in my face 
 And that's how she ended up back in my place 
 I wish I could go back in time 
 And correct that faded mistake 
 I wish she would just leave me alone 
 Stop calling my phone 
 Quit invading my home 
 Why don't you leave me alone 
 (Repeat twice) 
 Just leave that girl alone 
 "Knew I shouldn't have taken this girl's number" 
 Don't call her from your phone 
 "Damn, caller-ID" 
 Just leave that girl alone 
 "And to think that was the one" 
 Don't dare pick up your phone 
 "Damn, the attraction, gosh!" 
 (Repeat 1st verse) 
 The number you have called has been disconnected
