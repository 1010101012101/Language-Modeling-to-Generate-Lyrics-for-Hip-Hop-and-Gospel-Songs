(Feat. Faye-Ann Lyons) 
 Play, in this beautiful game 
 Where the rules and aim 
 Remain the same 
 It's the game of love unity 
 Play, in this beautiful game 
 Where the rules and aim 
 Will never change 
 It's the game of love unity 
 Sending out invitations 
 All over the world 
 Every race, every class, 
 Every man, every girl 
 Whether near, whether far 
 Come and join in the fun 
 (Oh na na na) 
 This is it, one big game that you cannot miss 
 No matter who you are - everyone's on the list 
 This is the game of life and we all are one 
 (So come along) 
 Play, in this beautiful game 
 Where the rules and aim 
 Remain the same 
 It's the game of love unity 
 Play, in this beautiful game 
 Where the rules and aim 
 Will never change 
 It's the game of love unity 
 Dancehall breakaway [x2] 
 We run the place 
 We set the pace 
 We lead the chase 
 Everybody participate and 
 No time to waste 
 Lift up the pace and celebrate 
 It's our obligation 
 We fascinate, we captivate 
 Your mind, your heart, soul and 
 Rhythm of the nation 
 We play, we play 
 We feel the game 
 Come on, come on 
 Let me see you gyrate 
 Bring along all your friends 
 And tell them join in 
 Cause this game never ends 
 Once it begins 
 We will spread peace and love 
 For eternity 
 All your worries and stress 
 Let them all go 
 We won't settle for less 
 'Cause we're all MELLO 
 Bring your heart and your soul and set your mind free 
 Play, in this beautiful game 
 Where the rules and aim 
 Remain the same 
 It's the game of love unity 
 Play, in this beautiful game 
 Where the rules and aim 
 Will never change 
 It's the game of love unity 
 We will rejoice 
 And sound our voice 
 'Cause we are one together 
 L.O.V.E. and unity, 
 Forever 
 Play, in this beautiful game 
 Where the rules and aim 
 Remain the same 
 It's the game of love unity 
 Play, in this beautiful game 
 Where the rules and aim 
 Will never change 
 It's the game of love unity
