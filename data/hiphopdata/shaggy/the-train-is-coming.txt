Shaggy 
 This girl got me waiting and the time has come for a decision to be made 
 Oh yes ooh well 
 Tell them ken boothe 
 Ken boothe 
 I say the train is coming baby 
 I say the train is coming now 
 I say the train is coming baby 
 I say the train is coming now 
 So long I've been waiting, waiting for you, (wait on my knees) oh lord 
 Now the time has come, when it's between you and me, oh lord 
 Because the train is coming baby 
 I say the train is coming now, now, now, now 
 I say the train is coming baby 
 And I am leaving on that train, lord 
 Shaggy 
 Woman me a go away and me naw come back 
 Stand up at the station with me suitcase packed 
 Gal how me love you but me naw turn back 
 Tell me right now this minute if you you coming or not 
 Stand up at the station at about six o'clock 
 Rain it a pour and lightning start to flash 
 I man wonder to myself whether she coming or not 
 Or it's about time I man wake up and face the fact 
 Well she find a new love and it's holding her back 
 That is why I'm standing by myself on the railroad track 
 Boop boop bop, heart a beat non-stop 
 There's no wonders or signs are you coming back 
 Ken boothe 
 I say the train is coming baby 
 I say the train is coming now 
 Everyday I pray for this little hour, ooh yau 
 Now the time has come and I want you to stand by me, ha 
 Because the train is coming baby, mm 
 I say the train is coming now, now, now, now 
 And we will roam this land, mmm, where we all will be free, lord 
 Shaggy 
 Look how long she have the general a wait 
 Time a run out and it a get kinda late 
 I am losing patience I'm in a bad state 
 Set me foot up on the train you naw go see me back again 
 Well me life long romance gone down the drain 
 All of a sudden me sunshine turn into rain 
 Fun and laughters into sorrows and pain 
 All because you left me waiting in vain 
 So me say women me love you but me naw come back 
 Stand up a the station with me suitcase packed 
 Shaggy
