Oh... 
 Baby I hope you dun get offended in anyway ya know 
 But your beauty is so 
 Magnificent 
 I'm just tempted to touch ya know 
 Yo bebe jus a meks sha a gwaan now?? 
 (Brian Gold - Chorus) 
 Would you be offended if I told ya 
 I like the way you lick your lips 
 Would you be offended if I showed ya 
 How I like to work those hips 
 Is it a rude for mi to wink 
 An let you know I like what I see 
 Would you be offended if I touch ya 
 Imagine how it could be 
 (Shaggy - Verse 1) 
 You're like a jewel baby 
 This ain't no pick up line 
 Epitome of a lady 
 Truly one of a kind 
 Wear a precious diamond 
 Wid all dem polish shine? 
 Can't wait to hold you closer 
 Can you read my mind 
 Later images for which I won't apologize 
 I hope that you can see the passion in my eyes 
 Won't over step our boundries 
 These words are hard to find 
 Stated my intentions 
 Hope you my way inclined 
 (Brian Gold) 
 Tell me if I'm wrong 
 Expressing how I feel 
 How can I go on 
 If I don't know the deal 
 Would you be offended if I told ya 
 I like the way you lick your lips 
 Would you be offended if I showed ya 
 How I like to work those hips 
 Is it a rude for mi to wink 
 An let you know I like what I see 
 Would you be offended if I touch ya 
 Imagine how it could be 
 (Shaggy - Verse 2) 
 No need to be embarrassed 
 I know you feel the same 
 You feel my record 
 Can I say this ain't no players game 
 You feel the spark between us 
 Come lets ignite the flame 
 'Cause if you let it pass 
 We'll only have ourselves to blame 
 Showing you a world of pleasure 
 That's my only aim 
 I wanna take ya to the clouds 
 An let you scream my name 
 This is your decision 
 Baby stake your claim 
 Take a chance 
 'Cause if you don't den it would be a shame 
 (Brian Gold) 
 Tell me am I'm wrong 
 Expressing how I feel 
 Can I go on 
 If I don't know the deal
