We'll be having fun 
 Under the golden sun 
 Christmas in Jamaica here we come... 
 We'll just sail on, just sail... 
 Lovers frolickin' 
 Playin' in the sand 
 Got my Coppertone 
 Getting on my tan 
 Exotic setting for a 
 Lady and her man 
 A perfect little holiday 
 Sounds like a plan 
 We can stay in bed all afternoon 
 We can make out to some cool Reggae tunes 
 We can sail under the light of the moon 
 Wish we could freeze this moment 
 Then it wouldn't end so soon... 
 Unplug the phones, y'all 
 Don't need no calls 
 No callin' home 
 Take a break from it all... 
 'Cause we both grown 
 And we can do whatever, see? 
 Baby, it's just you and me 
 Let's live out a fantasy 
 Hiking in the mountains, romantic rendezvous 
 Bathing in the fountains, stop-let me look at you... 
 Just in case you're doubtin', let me paint a view 
 Picture you're in heaven, everything is true
