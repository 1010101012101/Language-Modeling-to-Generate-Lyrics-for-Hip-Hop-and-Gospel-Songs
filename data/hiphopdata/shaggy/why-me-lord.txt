Early Sunday morning in the spring of 96 
 I'm chilling on my couch watching the bulls against the knicks 
 My honey marches in and ask if I think I'm slick 
 It seem she found my shirt with lipstick 
 I thought I could explain but then my story wouldn't stick 
 Incriminating pictures show me some other chick 
 It happened once before and she was tired of the tricks 
 She ask me if I can spell the word evict 
 Why me lord situation's looking kinda bad 
 Why me lord I lost the best girl I ever had 
 Why me lord I'm homeless and I'm feeling kinda sad 
 Why me why me why me why me 
 Why me lord how you member massa god so quick 
 Why me lord when trouble tek you pickney shirt a fit 
 Why me lord is just because you don't know when to quit 
 Why me why me why me why me 
 Why me, Why me lord, why me 
 Why me, Why me lord, why me 
 Why me, why me lord, why me 
 Just the other day when I was rolling with my crew 
 Made a little flex around by flatbush avenue 
 I'm calling to some honeys and sipping on my brew 
 That's when I saw the boys in blue 
 They pulled me to the side why I don't even have a clue 
 Looking for a reason and they finally found a few 
 A case of ammunition and a loaded thirty two 
 I can't believe what I'm going through 
 Why me lord here I am I gotta face the time 
 Why me lord though the evidence ain't even mine 
 Why me lord I swear I ain't guilty of the crime 
 Why me why me why me why me 
 Why me lord how you member massa god so quick 
 Why me lord when trouble tek you pickney shirt a fit 
 Why me lord is just because you don't know when to quit 
 Why me why me why me why me 
 Why me, Why me lord, Why me 
 Why me, Why me lord, Why me 
 Why me, Why me lord, Why me 
 Why me, Why me, Why me 
 Take heed never take advantage of the things you need 
 Never let yourself be over come by greed 
 Walk the straight and narrow and you shall succeed 
 Get you act up to speed 
 And try no matter what it takes to give a next man a blye 
 Everybody else deserve a piece a the pie 
 Honesty the best policy no sell no samfie 
 And if ya need me ask why
