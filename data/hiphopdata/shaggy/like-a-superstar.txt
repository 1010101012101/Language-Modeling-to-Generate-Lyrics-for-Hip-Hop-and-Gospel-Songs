 Everybody wanna come up when I'm at the bar 
 All the people wanna try 
 It's like give me some more 
 Try a little harder honey 
 Give me some more 
 Let's go I'm a superstar 
 Getting busy with the boys hanging at the bar 
 Everybody come across 'cause they all want me 
 You all knew when you saw me 
 I like how you look, baby call me
