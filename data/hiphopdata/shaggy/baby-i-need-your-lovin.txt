Baby, I need your lovin' 
 Baby, I need your lovin' 
 Although you're never here 
 Your voice I often hear 
 Another day, another night 
 I longed to hold you tight 
 'Cause baby I'm so lonely 
 Baby I need your lovin' 
 Got to have all your lovin' 
 Baby I need your lovin' 
 Got to have all your lovin' 
 Empty nights echo your name 
 Oh and sometimes I wonder if I'd ever be the same
