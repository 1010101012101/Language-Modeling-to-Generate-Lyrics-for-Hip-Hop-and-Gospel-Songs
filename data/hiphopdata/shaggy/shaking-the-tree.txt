Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon 
 We are shakin' the tree 
 Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon 
 We are shakin' the tree 
 Waiting your time, dreaming of a better life 
 Waiting your time, you're more than just a wife 
 You don't have to do what your mother has done 
 She has done, this is your life, this new life has begun 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon 
 We are shakin' the tree 
 Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon 
 We are shakin' the tree 
 Turning the tide, you are on the incoming wave 
 Turning the tide, you know you are nobody's slave 
 Find your sisters or brothers who can hear all the truth in what you say 
 They can support you when you're on your way 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon 
 We are shakin' the tree 
 Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon 
 We are shakin' the tree 
 Changing your ways, changing those surrounding you 
 Changing your ways, more than any man can do 
 Open your heart, show him the anger and pain, so you heal 
 Maybe he's looking for his womanly side, let him feel 
 You had to be so strong 
 And you do nothing wrong, nothing wrong at all 
 We're gonna break it down 
 We're gonna shake it down, shake it all around 
 ? 
 No no no no no no 
 No no no no no no 
 No no no no no no 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 It's your day, a woman's day 
 You had to be so strong 
 You do nothing wrong, nothing wrong at all 
 We're gonna break it down 
 We're gonna shake it down, shake it all around
