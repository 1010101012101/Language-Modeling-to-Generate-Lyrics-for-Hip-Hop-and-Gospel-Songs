 Verse 1 - SHAGGY 
 You thinking that your grown now, 
 You got your eyes set on the street, 
 Some how you think that you can stand on your feet, 
 No job, no house, no car 
 Tell me how can you quire these things, 
 I know just what your thinking, 
 The road you wanna take will leave you sinking, 
 You wanna roll around with your crew, 
 Tow drunks, 
 Gang bangs, 
 Steal cars 
 Doing all of these horrible things 
 Now tell me how were you mislead so easily, 
 When you was raised better by your family, 
 You trynna be something that you ain't meant to be, 
 Your mammas on her knews pray to GOD every night 
 'Cause she knows that your 
 Lost in the still of the night 
 Ain't no need to lose site, 
 She'll be holding the light oh yeah, 
 I'm lost in the still of the night ain't no need to lose site, 
 She'll be holding the light 
 Verse 2 - SHAGGY 
 See son it's never too late, 
 The effort to correct is never to great, 
 A family should stick together, 
 One blood, 
 One luv, 
 One heart open arms welcome you at the gate, 
 You thinking that I'm crazy, 
 I see through all them see your visions, 
 Hazzy, 
 I'm fired up with the preminotions, 
 Black suits, 
 Long faces sad words slow singing at the side of your grave 
 {Yeah} 
 Whenever I'm low 
 {Ugh} 
 All I need to know 
 {Oh yeah} 
 Is that your there for me your down for me my strength when I'm weak 
 Repeat
