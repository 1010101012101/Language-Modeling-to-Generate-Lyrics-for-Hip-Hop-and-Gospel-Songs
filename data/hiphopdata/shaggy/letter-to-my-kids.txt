(Shaggy talking:) 
 Ya, I gotta get real personal on this ya know, for me. 
 ?? 
 Screamin out two things. 
 (Shaggy verse 1:) 
 When I was young my ambition in life was to finish way ahead of the game, 
 Such a shame y'all payin' the price in this race of fortune and fame, 
 I really feel appologetic inside, 
 Though you'd never think to give me the blame, 
 Its when I look into your lives I wonder if it was really worth all the pain 
 (Shaggy and (background) chorus:) 
 Now I know what it takes, 
 In the heights of mistakes, 
 Is it there in the mind of a child, 
 Though it's all for our sakes, 
 Still my heart how it breaks, 
 Everytime that I see your smile, 
 (Check it) 
 (Shaggy verse 2:) 
 Conversation on the phone is fine but for me it could never replace, 
 Being there to spend quality time tuck you in to see the smile on your face, 
 So when you're old enough to read these lines I hope you never find yourself in my place, 
 I hope you never feel as lonely as I and miss the warmth of your childs embrace. 
 (Shaggy and (background) chorus:) 
 Now I know what it takes, in the heights of mistakes, 
 Is it there in the mind of a child (no no no no), 
 Though it's all for our sakes, 
 Still my heart how it breaks, every time that I see your smile 
 (Music break) 
 (Shaggy and (background) chorus:) 
 Now I know what it takes, in the heights of mistakes, 
 Is it there in the mind of a child (no no no no), 
 Though it's all for our sakes, 
 Still my heart how it breaks, 
 Everytime that I see your smile 
 (Shaggy and (background) chorus:) 
 Now I know what it takes, 
 In the heights of mistakes, 
 Is it there in the mind of a child, 
 Though it's all for our sakes, 
 Still my heart how it breaks, 
 Everytime that I see your smile
