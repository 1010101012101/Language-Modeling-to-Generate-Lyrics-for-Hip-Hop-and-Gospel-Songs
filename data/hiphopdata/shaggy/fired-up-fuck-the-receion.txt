Only got one life and I'ma live it up 
 I want the best shit, I'm stacking chips 
 I'm fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up 
 I'm fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up 
 You're spending euros my currencies are strong 
 We're stacking Benjamins, I want you know 
 I'm fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up 
 I'm fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up

 Fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up 
 Fired up, fired up, fired up, fired up, money 
 Fuck the recession, I'm spending
