Y dream, my dream, 
 My, my, my 
 Dream ha he 
 Dream ha he 
 Now I got to wonder if you dreaming or not 
 'Cause everything seems so real 
 Shaggy (cha) 
 As my days grow old and my night grow cold 
 And I yearn for your tender love 
 My desires are strong I can't seem to hold on 
 And I wanna feel your touch 
 Girl I love you so much it's way pass a crush 
 And they fantasy feels real 
 And when reality bites it cut likes a knife 
 And I wake up asking myself 
 Brian and Tony Gold 
 Is it really real or is it a dream 
 Is it really real or is it a dream 
 Hear me now 
 Girl you know sexy that you have it all together 
 Tickle up me fancy with you sweet smelling feather 
 Smooth like a silk you could be rough like a leather 
 Don't wake me up I want the moment to last forever 
 (Ha) time goes by you know my loving gets better 
 Passionate moment probably think I would a never 
 Have you in a mi thoughts girl you sit down and you wonder 
 Girl let this one last forever 
 As I reminisce on the times I missed 
 And the warmth of your tender lips 
 I can't help but wonder if I wake 
 Will I find a love like this (yeah, yeah) 
 I guess it's fair to say that 
 You are the woman in my dream 
 Well that's the word or haven't you heard 
 Why don't you get up and help me sing 
 Hear me, hear me 
 Is it a figment of my imagination 
 Or that me under sexual frustration 
 Right now me under nuff aggravation 
 Can't show it must protect man reputation 
 Now this is something I must ask a question 
 I would a really like ta know your intentions 
 In regards to my infatuation 
 Tell me 'bout the operation
