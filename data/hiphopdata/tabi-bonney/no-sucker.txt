Know a lot of cats 
 That be swimming with the sharks 
 And they ain't get ate up 
 But they definitely drown 
 Take a look around little brother 
 You surrounded by lions 
 What you goin' do when it go down 
 I know you got the heart 
 But it sure gets dim 
 And these cats know how to win 
 Man they serve it ala cart 
 I'm talking about them elves 
 You see what they did you Mel? 
 He had all the passion 
 And still got ripped apart 
 They hated on Jesus 
 So what you think they goin' do to you 
 When they hear your sound coming up them speakers 
 Coming up them speakers 
 Coming up them speakers 
 Man let the beat rock 
 I ain't tripping off these little diamonds 
 Hating on me blown just 'cause they weaker 
 Maybe they should quit 
 Hit themselves in the head with a brick 
 You ain't dope 'cause you got no sneakers 
 Let's talk about your crib 
 You still living with your mom 
 Come around my way 
 I'll show you how I live 
 I told them that I ain't no sucker 
 Ain't ain't no sucker 
 I ain't no sucker 
 So what's up now? 
 How you goin' be a thug if you're scared of the dark? 
 Gets the cool dudes mad 'cause I'm everything they're not 
 Maybe when they drop by I'll finally know their name 
 But until then they ain't getting no fing props 
 Course the grass is greener if you come and chill with me 
 What you think it's goin' be? 
 Man I'm up on MTV 
 Nobody put me on I've been grinding for some years 
 So it's funny when I hear that somebody put me on 
 Dollars like some kids little grown dudes scared 
 Can't fathom how a selfmade cat could make it big 
 Only true hustlers know about this hear 
 And know my momma I'm a future millionaire 
 Nothing but crabs in the bucket over there 
 I eat them by the bushel 
 Just season them with beer 
 Independent dude got a bonified career 
 Making major moves, everybody know we here
