She told me that she like me, yeah 
 She told me that she like me 
 Complimented on my Nikes 
 I told her that she don't but me and her are so unlikely 
 You're just too gorgeous, babe 
 I don't need random dudes fighting me 
 They just too jealous out here 
 Specially when they know we out here 
 I don't need that attention, your girlfriend like, no, he didn't 
 I don't need no Martin Lawrence and Pamela Redention 
 But anyways, we can kick it, just no real commitment 
 And I hope you in shape if you even plan on going the distance 
 Knock, knock, knock who is this? Oh my god, this girl is vicious 
 You look better in real life you should enroll of all your pictures 
 Where you been all my life, can't believe we just beginners 
 This course is for advanced swimmers, we in here with fishes 
 Jumping in the water, this ain't even what I ordered 
 I'm scared to look at the price, I just hope I can afford her 
 And if I can't then I guess I'll throw her back in the water 
 What would Jesus do, give her soul [Incomprehensible] 
 I hope you packed a parachute 
 You falling for me, we falling from 30000 feet 
 I hope you packed a parachute 
 You falling for me, we falling from 30000 feet 
 You better pack your parachute 
 You falling for me, we falling from 30000 feet 
 I hope you packed your parachute 
 You falling for me, we falling from 30000 feet 
 So now we rocking steady, every month's like February 
 She got me feeling like the kid again when girls were jellies 
 I give her candies, in return she given up her panties 
 This romantic shit is really starting to come in handy 
 I'm going deep and deeper, baby, just might need that ether 
 She going in for the kill, she just bought me my favorite sneakers 
 What you trying to me, girl, you know that's my weakness 
 Got me going to my mom and pops telling who she is 
 It's the one I know she is she got to be 
 Got me paranoid I'm thinking back on how she got to me 
 Please give me some privacy to figure out this PYT 
 If she is who she say she is then she'll walk down the ail with me 
 Hope that she don't lie to me 'cause I don't do apologies 
 I'm getting too far ahead of me, I need to chill and let this be 
 Now all my shit is catching after me 
 My girlfriend caught me chilling with my new girl sitting next to me 
 I hope you packed a parachute 
 You falling for me, we falling from 30000 feet 
 I hope you packed a parachute 
 You falling for me, we falling from 30000 feet 
 You better pack your parachute 
 You falling for me, we falling from 30000 feet 
 I hope you packed your parachute 
 You falling for me, we falling from 30000 feet
