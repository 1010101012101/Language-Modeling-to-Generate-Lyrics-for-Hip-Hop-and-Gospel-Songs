So I'm from langdon part, northeast dc part, 
 The north-east dc part and we jive be coming up with stuff all the time young, 
 Different terms and stuff like "put me in the pocket" 
 That's when somebody size you, you know what I'm saying, 
 You see a girl that's tight or something (she put you in the pocket), 
 Yeah when you rockin' bama, stylin on them and stuff young, 
 I be jive out there in the streets cruising 
 You might of see me out there doing anything but losing 
 If you fake imma put you out there 
 You might here some oohin (ooh) but I don't wanna take it there 
 So you know I was all on point as usual 
 I can tell cause people usually point and say that's crucial 
 Even though that's force I ain't never wear fubu 
 'Cause I ain't no bama and the girls are no a boo-you 
 But if it's you do you, I don't like to copy, I be on moschino, versace and gucci 
 They be lookin' sloppy wondering why they ain't got no groupies (they ain't got no groupies) 
 And I don't just rap for a hobby I do it for the groupies (psych, psych) 
 I do it just to uh... put you in the pocket, so put me in the pocket 
 Put me in the pocket (pocket)

 I was on the phone with this girl that was extra girly 
 She was being extra and tried to carry me 
 So I had to next her she got problems with self-esteem 
 So that might affect her 
 My moms give me lectures, I been out of school for like 10 semesters 
 I got my diplomas to fall back on her 
 Soon as you turn around I'm right up on ya 
 If you ain't got a heart I hope you ain't a organ donor 
 If she got a level head I'm right up on her (on her, on her) 
 Speakin' of head imma go ahead and stay ahead of them all 
 You can find benet runway and boutiques not the mall
