 Eff tryna make a livin' 
 I'm tryna make a killin' 
 Body everything 
 And make a ma million 
 I'm tryna make a killin' 
 I'm tryna make a killin' 
 Body everything 
 Everything, everything 
 Won't ever catch me slippin', 1990 Pistons 
 Six gears shiftin', and you can't close the distance 
 My drive's relentless, my whole team committed 
 I'm back in business, my London office wicked 
 Bonney one-way gettin' it, this money is nutritious 
 I'm lickin' green clean off the plate, ya, no dishes 
 I came to win, I don't do pretend 
 And you don't need to like me, I don't need no more new friends 
 I suppose now I'm jumpin' out the gym 
 Outta here, outer space, like damn 
 Can't they see we gone, damn, I guess not 
 I'm far from the block, just cut the TV on 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Eff tryna make a livin' 
 I'm tryna make a killin' 
 Body everything 
 And make a ma million 
 I'm tryna make a killin' 
 I'm tryna make a killin' 
 Body everything 
 Everything, everything 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I'm here to catch a body, no maybes or no probablys 
 I'm puttin' on a show tonight, my nigga, "La Di Da Di" 
 That means I'm ballin' hard, that means the court is ours 
 That means that waitress bringin' bottles that are overcharged 
 She see us burnin' money, the Burnin' Money Brothers 
 She burn her morals, let the family fuck behind each other 
 That shit ain't nothin' new, we buy handbags and shoes 
 That money comin' way too fast and that's what ballers do 
 We sittin' ringside in them mink hides 
 We watch the fight, they watchin' us, the chains is king size 
 Your doors just open up, my doors is pointin' up 
 It's like that Lamborghini tellin' you in God we trust 
 It's only God we fear, we know the Feds is near 
 We know you snitches tellin' everything you see and hear 
 But still we keep a-flossin', them kilos keep a-tossin' 
 We gonna show it, nigga, blow it 'til we hit the coffin 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Eff tryna make a livin' 
 I'm tryna make a killin' 
 Body everything 
 And make a ma million 
 I'm tryna make a killin' 
 I'm tryna make a killin' 
 Body everything 
 Everything, everything 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Yeah
