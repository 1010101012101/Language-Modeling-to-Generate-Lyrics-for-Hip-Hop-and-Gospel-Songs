Chorus:you are my super hero (I said I said) 
 You are my super hero) 
 Can I take you with me, can you come get me 
 Where we goin', we going to this place called startum 
 If we leave now we can be there by autumn 
 Can we leave now, before else try and be down 
 What's current is some one might catch a beat down from my ex girlfriend tryin' to rebound 
 Everyone out there is a dreamer, so many rappers that seen us 
 So many ballers and actors, this pretty girl want me to call her 
 I was so attractive to make people jump through hoops and back flips 
 Some end up on the mattress and we man it ain't nothin' but practice 
 Oh how I love to win, get money on you for win 
 Get money, get money, get money, get... get money, get money, get money like 
 Can I take my cape off, sit down take the weight off 
 Nah aw, what's left is gonna pay off, 'cause I'm always on my grind everyday every night 
 Tryin' to figure out how to make it, if you gotta dream you better make sure you chase it 
 Because I live mine, I'm working 9-5 out this grind 
 Can we do this while the rest of the world stay clueless 
 They'll catch on later, hit the close door button on the elevator 
 Goin' up now, so spittin' everyone sayin' what's up now 
 The view from the top is awesome, we should come up here more often 
 Ain't no losers up here we lost em 
 Welcome, this is the life we chose I suppose 
 We gonna get our money with a couple more Os O... ooh 
 Now they get it, we live by ain't saying nothin' fictitious 
 We dealin' with a man with no feel in his heart 
 That's a man that's... ambitious 
 Can I take you with me 
 Can You come and get me 
 Everybody out there is a dreamer 
 So many rappers that seen us 
 Can I take you with me 
 Can you come and get me 
 Come and get me 
 Can I take you with me 
 Everyone out there is a dramer so many rappers that seen us (fading out)
