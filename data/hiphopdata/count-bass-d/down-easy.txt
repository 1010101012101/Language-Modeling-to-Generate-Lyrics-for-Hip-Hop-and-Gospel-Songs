(Jamican Rambling) 
 Yo, Why can't I move forward? 
 Why can't I leave you alone? 
 Why can't you stop calling me on the phone? 
 Stop contacting me, 
 Stop being concerned with me 'cause I love you 
 And I need you. 
 But I know that we cannot be together, 
 And I know that we should be apart. 
 And I know it's not feasible with my situation right now. 
 Yeah. 
 Leave me alone, let me down easy. 
 Leave me alone, let me down gently. 
 Tonight, right now. 
 Why must you still like me and be friendly, 
 When I can't reciprocate? 
 You're my Kate and I'm your Alley. 
 You're my Cagney and I'm your Lacey, 
 Oh baby baby. 
 Right here, right now. 
 I'm gonna show you how 
 How to walk out through the door. 
 If you don't do it 
 You might go through it with a size 11. 
 Forget the rest of that baby. 
 Let me down, easy, that's right. 
 That was the intro, this is the outro. 
 Hope you enjoyed that, ok? Thank you very much, goodnight.
