 He's not mature enough for tantric sex yet 
 One nigga, 5 broads, the mingus sextet 
 Gamoura, saddam heussein, who crazy 
 Raw digga nigga so the man ain't lazy 
 After the 5th stroke, the sixth play dress poker 
 He's fully clothed with the money that he throught he owe'd her 
 Or that he thought he owe'd em 
 Know when to hold 'em when to fold em 
 Make you wish you could erase it out your cable modem 
 Organic analog straight out my scsi port 
 Online, kids pitch a bitch cause my songs short 
 A human by day, more cartridge than your play 
 Rap production stars all sample work and no play 
 I tell you like fats told mingus 
 Jazz ain't supposed to make no body millions 
 Records I'm with that, CD's I'm with that, mp3s is aight but DAT, man Fuck that
