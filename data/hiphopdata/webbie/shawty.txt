(Listen to this track bitch!) 
 (Chorus: t-pain) 
 Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl 
 Ima call you my shawty 
 'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad 
 I beat his ass for my shawty 
 And we ain't did nothin' that we ain't supposed to do 
 Cause you my shawty 
 Babygirl you know I be home, keep me on the ringtone shawty 
 Sing it to me girl 
 (Webbie:) 
 So what's happening with you kinfolk 
 As for me it's just the same old same old 
 Different bitch same hoe 
 I slang it fast switch it slow 
 Switch it and slang more 
 Ain't cuttin' wat you came for 
 These women love this thang though 
 Got us a different thang though 
 Got a whole other man 
 Better value what he got 
 For he don't have his spot 
 Talk alot, off the top I feel yet 
 Hope alot and I know it's rough and all 
 But tell me you call alot 
 And I ain't never hit ya spot 
 Want even finna try 
 I holla at ya and tell you bye 
 I treat you like one of the guys 
 And I put you on that killa 
 I remember the first time 
 Said your body feel different 
 Was asking me was you high 
 When I brought that new candy 
 I picked you up we'll ride 
 Haters hated on the ride 
 Now me and my shawty shine 
 Couple of the girls they hit me up 
 Wouldn't even pick up the line 
 When my old lady hit me shit 
 I just tell you to be quiet 
 (Chorus: t-pain) 
 Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl 
 Ima call you my shawty 
 'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad 
 I beat his ass for my shawty 
 And we ain't did nothin' that we ain't supposed to do 
 Cause you my shawty 
 Babygirl you know I be home, keep me on the ringtone shawty 
 Sing it to me girl 
 (Webbie:) 
 Tell me how you want do it 
 (How you want do it) 
 We can shot out to florida 
 Up in that charger and go party up in houston 
 Shawty don't worry bout that dude 
 'Cause if you lose him he lose 
 You don't need to confuse him 
 Hit me if you need me to do it 
 My old lady a loser 
 'Cause she knew it was for you 
 All that shit ain't for my sister 
 All that shit be for you 
 Said I was kicking it with boosie 
 But I was really with you boo 
 You my shawty and I ain't letting you loose 
 I get the questioning you 
 Sometimes I start to forget 
 That we ain't all the way click 
 And I get caught in the mix 
 Just tryin' to watch out for you 'cause I know I got a dick 
 And I tell the women some shit 
 That I just be all about hitting 
 So don't never forget me if I got to leave you 
 I miss you 
 I'm call you my shawty and you can call me your nigga you heard me 
 (Chorus: t-pain) 
 Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl 
 Ima call you my shawty 
 'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad 
 I beat his ass for my shawty 
 And we ain't did nothing that we ain't supposed to do 
 Cause you my shawty 
 Baby girl you know I be home, keep me on the ring tone shawty 
 Sing it to me girl 
 (Webbie:) 
 E.n.t young savage 
 You and me shawty 
 Now you know how we get down 
 Tell dem other hoes sit down 
 Don't open up your mouth 
 And we gone thug it out 
 Don't fell out over my house I know what you talking bout 
 Call and tell him you just tired 
 Tell him you just walk it out 
 He beat you he was wrong 
 And didn't come home till that morning 
 Girl I meet you on that corner and my problems he don't wanna 
 So just gone leave him alone if he keep on I'm a stomp him 
 Hit me if you need company 
 And if I can I'm coming 
 'Cause behind you I get crazy hey shawty you my baby 
 You feel like my old lady but I got an old lady 
 So just do me this lil favor 
 Give it here let me keep it 
 That's better than letting him play you 
 Being my little secret 
 I like diamonds 
 I'm a treat you like one of my favorite pieces 
 Lost a thirty grand bracelet last weekend and shit 
 (Chorus: t-pain) 
 Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl 
 Ima call you my shawty 
 'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad 
 I beat his ass for my shawty 
 And we ain't did nothin' that we ain't supposed to do 
 Cause you my shawty 
 Babygirl you know I be home, keep me on the ringtone shawty 
 Sing it to me girl
