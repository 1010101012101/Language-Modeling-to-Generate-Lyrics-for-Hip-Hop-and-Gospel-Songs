Lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right 
 'Cause you can look around and wont find nobody like us 
 Just like a light bulb 
 You came and brightened my life up 
 That's why right not I don't wanna be no where else but beside ya 
 I feel like you all I got so Ima keep you close tah me 
 Everything gone be aite I promise you just go wid me 
 First I lost my first love 
 I thought I was through wid dis 
 Love done got me trapped again man how did I do dis shit 
 How did I get caught up in relations wid my dog ass 
 I can get you locked up bae you stole my heart and hauled ass 
 Ain't no turning back now 
 You gotta part you gotta play 
 Fuck what all day people say 
 Just pray and he gone make a way 
 I wake up and you make my day 
 Jump fresh den I'm on my way 
 You don't ask where I'm goin' cause you know I'm goin' tah make some cake 
 This can't be no mistake 
 Because it feel so great 
 Offer me the world if I can't have my girl I'm straight 
 My bitch, my own one 
 Its miserable on sum 
 They say you the wrong one and I'll see in the long run 
 Life, if you can't enjoy it wid me I don't want nun 
 It feels so right I don't wanna be right if this shit wrong 
 If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right 
 If bein right means bein widout you 
 Id ratha live a wrong doin' life 
 Ya mama and daddy say it's a shame 
 It's a downright disgrace 
 Long as I got you by my side 
 I don't care what ya people say 
 If this shit wrong then fuck it I guess Ima just keep fuckin' up 
 'Cause everybody make mistakes and you my lil buttacup 
 Bae million dolla mansions, smokin' purple while we cuddle up 
 I got cameras all around this bitch 
 Nobody bet not fuck wid us 
 Not just another girl tah me 
 See girl you mean the world tah me 
 I don't wanna be right if lovin' you is wrong 
 Girl you got me gone 
 Got me feelin' like you mine and I can't leave you on yo own 
 Feel like you the best 
 Gave you access tah everything I own 
 Buy me summin sweet den run tah you and let you have the keys 
 Sometimes my niggas laugh at me but I know you'll be there fah me 
 Actually, it's been times I thought about you marryin me 
 Den I hit the blunt again and snap back tah reality 
 This ass fah me 
 And it feels so good that it just can't go bad 
 And I already knew so if it fuck up then I can't be mad 
 I call ha my angel I think she call me ha supaman 
 I promise if this don't work I ain't neva doin' dis shit again 
 If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right 
 If bein right means bein widout you 
 Id ratha live a wrong doin' life 
 Ya mama and daddy say it's a shame 
 It's a downright disgrace 
 Long as I got you by my side 
 I don't care what ya people say 
 I got money I put diamonds all on my pretty woman 
 'Cause I know if she coulda she woulda done it fah me 
 Some people say she ugly and otha mite say she straight 
 All I know is I love and that's all I gotta say 
 I kiss on you everyday I miss on you when I'm away 
 I feel like you the one fah me I tell you dat shit to yo face 
 You don't know what you've done tah me 
 See actually you've captureed me 
 And locked me in yo own lil world 
 And it's like we can't find the key 
 I don't feel we need the key 
 Feel like this where we needa be 
 We worked so hard just tah feel dis shit 
 We can't let it fall down that easily 
 You so sweet. I'm so street, you so real, I'm so trill 
 Got so many scars 
 Been in so many battles 
 Don't nothin' else matta but how you make me feel 
 Girl I just wanna have you here 
 And leave all the bullshyt I got out there 
 Whateva you did before we met ain't nun of my business wont even much care 
 If this shit wrong I don't wanna be right if this ain't right I ratha be wrong 
 'Cause I feel I need you in my life if I can't have that I would rather be gone
