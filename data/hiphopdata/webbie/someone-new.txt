C'mon ... Webbie 
 C'mon ... Trill Entertainment 
 Bae ... bae 
 In my own state of mind 
 Sittin' here all alone thinkin' bout that lady of mine 
 Damn I did her wrong 
 All the things that I promised to her 
 How can I turn around and bring this much of drama to her 
 Boo I'm sorry and I was selfish and I know it hurted 
 But I ain't did dat on purpose 
 Ain't nobody perfect 
 So I jus wanna tell you baby, if you ever leave me 
 I got a lil you in my heart that ain't gon neva leave me 
 At times I used to treat you like just anotha hoe 
 But we will both always know that you deserve mo 
 I know you'll give ya life for me baby, I ain't lyin' 
 I'm ginuine and I been feelin' dat the whole time 
 So check this out 
 If you should eva find a new dude 
 Don't you go and forget a thang dat I told you 
 Like you da one and don't a thang come befo you 
 And I ain't been runnin' no game. dis da whole truth ... boo 
 If you should ever find someone new 
 I know he better be good to you 
 If you should ever find someone new 
 I know he better be good to you 
 Now for years, this been where home at 
 On tha real, I can't see you wit anotha cat 
 The way I feel, like don't a thang come above you 
 Make me feel like can't anotha man love you 
 Boo, I hate to see anotha man stare at you 
 Let alone, let anotha man have you 
 But you already know dat I ain't share you 
 Don't wanna let you go, but shid I'm prepared to 
 But if I had a choice, dat wouldn't be what I'll choose 
 I know you know dat I'll rather be beside you 
 Hand and hand every step so I can guide you 
 And I know you can tell that when I'm inside you 
 The reason we ain't always seein eye to eye, boo 
 'Cause I ain't one of those guys who gon lie to you 
 If you slip up and let anotha man blind you 
 Make sho nothin' but the best what he provide you 
 But yeah 
 You goin' to some body else, I ain't tryna see it 
 But knowin' dat I gave you so many reasons to leave me 
 I can already see it 
 And all the trust that we had here 
 After years and years, I neva thought it all disappear 
 But all my secrets have not been revealed 
 It's over now and I think if we both try it can be revealed 
 But if not, I ain't trippin' hear 
 I'm still ya nigga, if you ever need love, you can get it here 
 And it don't matter what he done to ya 
 You got a problem, jus holla and watch how fast I run to ya 
 No matter where you at I'm comin' to ya 
 Just look ova ya shoulders for me, yo lil soldier, I ain't far from ya 
 My life if full of dark nights 
 You a star to me 
 And can't nobody else have you 
 You already tooken 
 But if shit don't go as planned 
 Look here ... 
 (Chorus repeats and fades out)
