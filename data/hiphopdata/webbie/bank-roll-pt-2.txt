I send this out to my childhood role model cap mursk big bank rolls, 
 Suzuki all bauds, fresh starchy clothes had all da fine hoes 
 Every time he took a picture he pulled out his bankroll 
 I watched I observed niggas taught me how the serve (word) 
 Turnt sixteen I was gettin' a quarter bird, big knots in my Dickie pants, 
 Had a plug on dat weed and had a plug on 
 That cain 'm off da chain mayne! Trell came home I was on, 
 Everything dat nigga throwed me it was gone 
 Lil' ivy taught me bankrolls fuck a bitch I got dis caine mayne 
 And I got dis weed and syrup shit well let's get rich 
 I got too many knots I couldn't put it in a box (Damn!) 
 6 months really a nigga actin' silly made a one fifty 
 When I put it in my mind I can 
 Make a million dollars if I grind, bankroll tim! 
 Bankroll after bank roll 
 Big money I like it bank roll after bank roll a million 
 Dollars on my mine hundred gs at a time 
 I'm like a bitch with a bank roll take a nigga 
 Shoppin' got her own shit take a nigga 
 Blockin' you out there poppin' them pills fuckin' them stank hoes 
 Keep it real you ain't really about your bank rolls 
 Satisfy a couple stacks now you 
 Straight blushin drugs every day 
 Nigga now every day I spend a thousand cash 
 So every time money calls I gotta bust my ass 
 I'm on the grind bitch bank roll after bank roll 
 I'm ain't playin' my nigga I got a mansion my nigga 
 Now just hit me with a bank roll she 
 Just hit me with a bank roll 
 But I call them back like I need more 
 So many keys I can feed it ain't a game partner 
 All long I eaten good ask my baby momma threw 
 All the drama I'm a shine I'm a grind 
 And picture the booth with a big bank roll 
 Bank roll after bank roll a million hundred's 
 On my mind a hundred gs at a time nigga 
 Bank roll after bank roll a million hundred's 
 On my mind a hundred gs at a time nigga

 City talkin' about another milli' 
 What up Mr. Bank roll same thing 
 Stackin' my paper till the game done change 
 'Cause I love me a bank roll fuckin' right cause without
