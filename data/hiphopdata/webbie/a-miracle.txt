Rick ross: Trilla 
 Birdman: brrrr! 
 Webbie: the lil soldier wit nothin' clear to see wasn't nobody handin him shit 
 Ridin' round town glamour and glistenin 
 Ya don't won't my position, I'm spittin' facts 
 Couldn't relax, the whole time I had weight up on my back 
 Be black gon back, I got pistols on deck 
 They gave 'cause seven flat, how many niggas gon rat 
 Check my tats, ya neva heard of dis ya suppose to man 
 It had to fair, now I meet da family and dem, it packed at Madison Square 
 I had career, I supposed to be right back there with dem 
 I owed it to him, I know it I show it 
 Don't wanna blow it or pour it 
 For da streets, give me a beat ima roll it 
 Show it wit dem leavin' magic 
 But I knew I had it in savage 
 It got crucial I ain't panic, when y'all want it, I ran it 
 I remember when my granny said anything was to happen 
 From slangin, hustlin, to trappin 
 Laugin, prayin' jackin 
 I'm blowin' on granddaddy and all my kids happy it's a miracle 
 Chorus:(2x) it seem like I'm dreamin', ah somebody pinch me 
 Am I supposed be in da spot dat I'm in, is dis really real 
 All dese years, am I really here 
 Have I really live what they call a miracle 
 Birdman: how you shoot clips, put it in the air 
 Mean mug dem niggas and have no fear 
 Play the game wit dem stripes, put it in his life 
 Ten on da mic, nigga do it da same night 
 It's a miracle, da way I bend dem corners on dem 
 Get up early on dem, get dis money on dem 
 A miracle, a lot I bought on, crib I paid on, thangs I got on 
 A miracle, fresh crush to diamond ice, place in one price, did it for one night 
 A miracle, I don't lived da high life 
 Shined in high lights, did it with gun fights 
 A miracle, nigga it was hell we came in 
 Money didn't come in, hell we went in 
 A miracle, no time lyin' homie 
 Time for crime homie, time for dyin' homie 
 Rick Ross: its truly a miracle, dat boy still a live 
 'Cause I was sellin bo in '95 
 Ridin' wit my boys deallin dope gettin' high 
 Crackers tryin' to give me time, and we ain't talkin' 5 
 Niggaz talk fly so dat pistol by my side 
 My baby mama fuckin', all my homies on da sly 
 I see all through da corner of nigga eyes 
 So I keep my shades on, and my face up at da sky 
 Pistons get da power, snitchin is for cowards 
 I got plasmas in da shower, and my bitches snortin powder 
 I'm a g, my life a movie, I got rubber uzzi's in my jacuzzi 
 They think I'm biggie, I'm bumpin juicey wit several grouppies 
 I got beamers and business, bitch they all on duces 
 I got da pruduct, and when ya drop it, it neva loses 
 Da prey get prayed on, killers get prayed for 
 It dis a dream, I pray I neva wake up
