Ease your mind a little bit (ease your mind) 
 Light up that blunt (light up that motherfuckin' blunt) 
 Lift back that sunroof (lift back your shit nigga) 
 This that shit that we high to 
 This that shit that we vibe to 
 This that shit that we get high to 
 That gangster music nigga 
 And you can try but you ain't Lil' Boosie nigga no (no) 
 Bad bitches got you feelin' great 
 Looked at my CEO like CEO let's get this cake, baby 
 I hit the stage and hoes go crazy, I'm player made 
 All my hoes got Jordan skills, they fade away 
 I hit the mall and bought (shit) throwback after throwback 
 Everybody wanna take pictures they like, "Damn, you Mr. Kodak." 
 Smoke comin' out my sun roof a nigga shining 
 A nigga love gettin' pussy love rocking diamonds 
 If you got kids in this world, nigga, handle your business 
 And you don't need no nigga, be independent 
 It's murder murder niggas beefin' niggas slingin' nines 
 And I keep that purple purple to ease my mind 
 Smokin' on purple ease my mind 
 This that shit that we get high to, yeah 
 It's murder, murder, murder gotta keep you nine 
 This that shit that we ride to, yeah 
 Smokin' on purple ease my mind 
 This that shit that we get high to, yeah 
 It's murder, murder, murder gotta keep you nine 
 This that shit that we ride to, yeah 
 I know the game I know the street 
 I got the raps you got the beats 
 And we're gonna lay it down real sweet 
 So you all can ride, head bobbin side to side 
 I don't want shit from my fans but this: feel a real nigga's vibe 
 When you down and out, don't nobody trust you 
 But when you got bread it seem like everybody love you 
 It's still fucked up mayne in certain cases (believe this nigga, look) 
 They still racist, I can see it on them bitches' faces 
 That's why I'm smokin' and laughin' I got my grind on 
 And they don't feel my struggle they think my mind gone 
 That's why it's murder, murder kill, kill on the corner 
 These little niggas got big pistols ready to put it on your 
 So, when you die you might as well be high 
 Is it heaven or hell or is it all a lie? 
 That's why I smoke purple on Monday, purple on Tuesday 
 Two glocks cocked so they don't bruise me 
 Smokin' on purple ease my mind 
 This that shit that we get high to, yeah 
 It's murder, murder, murder gotta keep you nine 
 This that shit that we ride to, yeah 
 Smokin' on purple ease my mind 
 This that shit that we get high to, yeah 
 It's murder, murder, murder gotta keep you nine 
 This that shit that we ride to, yeah 
 Smoking on that doja I done got a bag for cheap, nigga 
 Eyes barely open and I'm glued to the backseat 
 Boosie took another hit and then he passed it back to me 
 This shit must got something in it, niggas slipped some crack with weed 
 Ain't no crack up in the windows I can barely even breathe 
 Got me fumblin' and trippin' almost passed the blunt to Cee 
 Got it cloudy in the Bentley niggas squinting tryin' to see 
 And they don't know what time it is but I know it's time to eat 
 Ridin' dirty bumping, ridin' dirty know how that shit be 
 One day your hear and the next day you going on repeat 
 With that nine up in my reach right now dyin' ain't for me 
 Mayne this pine got me sleepy but I'm too high to go to sleep 
 Bust a hooty when you rollin' potent as you s'posed to be 
 You be rollin' and smokin' 'em back to back consistently 
 Keep movin' dutches to Phillies, garcias, and shisha sweets 
 Young savage don't really care just put that shit in the air 
 Smokin' on purple ease my mind 
 This that shit that we get high to, yeah 
 It's murder, murder, murder gotta keep you nine 
 This that shit that we ride to, yeah 
 Smokin' on purple ease my mind 
 This that shit that we get high to, yeah 
 It's murder, murder, murder gotta keep you nine 
 This that shit that we ride to, yeah
