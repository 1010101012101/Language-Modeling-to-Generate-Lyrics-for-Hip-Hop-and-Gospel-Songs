Laid way back behind black gettin' blowed 
 Full of high dro and you can smell it on my clothes 
 Man I live up in B.R.

 My shit got a bad motor I ain't promised till tomorrow 
 So as long as I got gas ima drive it till tomorrow 
 Lookin' for a bitch that's bad so we can act until tomorrow

 Lets go posted up at the spot and make some change till tomorrow 
 If I'm laid shit I might do the same thang tomorrow 
 Laid way back behind black gettin' blowed 
 Full of high dro and you can smell it on my clothes 
 I was spose to go drop my red bone off or not 
 For some fit she trynna cop said she need right now 
 What had happen was I had stopped by my nigga B spot 
 And he had a big blunt of that dro and I forgot 
 I was spose to go to the studio I got some hits to drop 
 But a bitch had hit me on the phone and told me to come pick her up 
 I'm high as fuck my dick got hard 
 She tellin' me how she so hot 
 She took those draws off and I forgot 
 Went to check the mailbox 
 Some sepeana from the mothafucka 
 Tellin' me my court date in 2 weeks for beatin' on my older woman 
 Showed up at that hoe apartment 
 Smokin' somethin' ran into her 
 Put it in her mouth and charges dropped 
 Laid way back behind black gettin' blowed 
 Full of high dro and you can smell it on my clothes 
 When I walk up in the mall with that big ass stack 
 Fresh kicks fresh boes with the jersey to match 
 You know I got to do it big nigga give me the hat 
 Manager comin' out the back cause all he smell is that dro 
 When I go and see my hoes my eyes be all low 
 My clothes be full of smoke they mommas be knowin' I'm blown 
 Them ghetto mommas don't trip they be askin you got some mo 
 Let her momma hit the dro and she smell is that dro 
 When I hit the club they can tell 
 'Cause I'm puttin' it in the air 
 Hoes ask can they hit niggaz askin is it for sale 
 Security don't be trippin' they be puttin' in the air 
 When you in here that's all you smell high dro is what we smokin' 
 When we be 
 Laid way back behind black gettin' blowed 
 Full of high dro and you can smell it on my clothes
