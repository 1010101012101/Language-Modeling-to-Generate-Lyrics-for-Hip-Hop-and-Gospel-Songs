Me too, I'm fucking her too 
 Can't, fucking her too? 
 We should get them bands up 
 Get all the woes calling. 
 Pumped up in there all this 
 Could add some extra mountain, 
 Money ain't a living, man, 
 Money ain't a closing. 
 Bitch, I can't stand here 
 While I talk to you! 
 Fucked up, yeah, you're fucked up, 
 Yeah, I'm fucking her too! 
 We should get them bands up 
 Get all the woes calling. 
 Pumped up in there all this 
 Could add some extra mountain, 
 This the reason why she said 
 That she don't wanna do it. 
 'Cause everybody was gon'know 
 But she was gonna know it. 
 She got a man, she wanna keep it 
 On the low low. 
 But all y'all see receiving 
 The yo-yo. 
 So I'm being with her real, 
 I ain't feel the play. 
 And on the real, yeah, 
 I wanna fuck her anyway. 
 I let her climb up on my balls 
 I see her pun in her hole 
 My money long, big lawn, 
 Let my clicks flow. 
 Check her purse 
 I bet you'll find her number 
 And her phone. A player from the 
 Himalaya, I stay from the Rome. 
 Put that thing up so your dogs 
 See you working hard! 
 How's she tasting, say it 
 Tastes like sweet 
 We should get them bands up 
 Get all the woes calling.

 I can handle this quick, 
 But I ain't in a hurry. 
 Gonna sleep late, I'm up early, 
 ? 
 Say she need me, she hurting, 
 What I did, don't count none, 
 She I.D.'d her purse up. 
 My bands are worth it, 
 But everything's not perfect. 
 I blow money on dumb shit. 
 On prank shit, on Berkeley's, 
 Though your outfit is worth it, 
 Go now, be surfaced. 
 I fuck the Police 
 By clicking the worst'es. 
 We drop hold by purses 
 I stay? 
 We burp in, no herpes, 
 I don't show no mercy. 
 She want to kick me, 
 But she don't deserve me. 
 I ain't got no worries, 
 I ain't got no worries!

 Come on, ? So we fucking, what? 
 Am I supposed to cry? 
 I go killer, like O.G. Simpson, 
 Let them find out! 
 I'd fuck a whole appeasing, 
 And she? 
 And if she tell you that she didn't 
 It's a damn lie! 
 Why you a glowing up? 
 False! She gon'sucking my balls. 
 I be fucking with you, nigger, 
 I know you a dog! 
 With the snake in I get you 
 Hopping like a frog. 
 All these motherfucking frogs, 
 I'm so sick of y'all! 
 Bust a buster like a rubber, 
 Let you hear that Pow!, 
 It ain't no cure from them diseases, 
 Now you go, I don't! 
 How you lining up blood 
 Like it's the time of the month. 
 And see how bad it's, 
 I only fucked her once!
