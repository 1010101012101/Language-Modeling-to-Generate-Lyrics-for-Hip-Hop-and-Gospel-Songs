 (Webbie) 
 Now I know, that you ain't really bout that shit that you be talkin' about 
 And you be just runnin' ya mouth but you'll get knocked out, drug out the club house 
 Showin up with yo thugs, me and my thugs'll make yo thugs bounce 
 I, suggest that you respect it, disrespect Ill have to check it and when I check it gets hectic 
 You don't want no savage doin' no damage to yo section, while I fuck yo babymama she say fuck my babydaddy 
 If a nigga wants some static let'em have that's the G-Code, since 94' I been throwed up in beast mode
