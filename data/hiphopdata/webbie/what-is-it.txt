 Is it my cars is it my clothes 
 That make these ho's want fuck fo' sho 
 Is It my style the way I roll 
 That makes these haters want hate some mo' 
 Is it that fifth that I drink, When 
 I'm in my whip wit the fresh ass paint 
 That make these ho's 
 Want look at my face 
 An make these niggas 
 Wan be at my place 
 Or tell me is it my shoes, 
 That cost three hundred 
 That make me have to go ????, 
 Gone make a niga hate my mommas son 
 Maybe it my style, this the way I come 
 Or maybe its these ho's 
 That I've done be's 
 Maybe is yo sista or yo niece 
 O' how I rock my baud's wit no crease 
 Or how I'm so grown and off the leash or 
 Tell me is it these shoes on my feet, 
 An how they matchin' my fists so perfectly 
 That make a hata wanna 
 Go about they way on me

 And how every mouth all witten want suck on me, 
 Or tell me is it that screen

 Or tell me is it my style how I'm just so fly 
 Now a nigga so wow plus I'm on right now 
 Tell me is it my hood,

 Or how I holla at my people 
 Befo they get you some mo' 
 Handalin' Bentleys with the 
 Big tires and spokes

 Or how I'm made this here whip

 Or is it the platinum plaque
