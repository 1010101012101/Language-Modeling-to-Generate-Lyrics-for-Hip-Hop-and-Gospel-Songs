(Intro: Webbie talking) 
 Boo... I mean you my baby man. 
 All that other shit, that shit ain't fucking real. 
 Look, I love ya. I don't even be remembering these bitches names today. 
 Sometimes I don't even know they name before it even happen. 
 Know what I'm saying? 
 When you be gone I'm wonderin where you at, what you doen and who you with. Lookin' at da phone wonderin what's takin' so long for you to get back. Kiss you where I miss you at. Know where I'm finna take it at, say you not in da mood... So it's cool watch I'm a get you wet. U my Night, Day all dat. U my what ya call, when ya wanna take ya time settle down and share it all. U can have half of all this, U my baby gal. Da way I feel if you ever disappear, I swear my heart'll just stop! Even if I never ever make it to the top, be here to make me feel good... U give me a natural high. Done quit messin around, told all dem other girls byeeeee. If I wasn't paper chasin probably wouldn't even much leave ya side. Bonnie, Clyde... Everybody eyes on us look and listen to me, everything gon be fine. Ya brighten up my days when the sun don't shine. I tell ya all da time. 
 (Chorus: Bobby V.) 
 She got dat pretty brown round, drivin' me wild. Can't let ya go girl, so if ya wanna holla, holla back! Cause baby I want you, baby I need U. So if you wanna holla, holla back! Cause shawty know she lookin' like whoa. Shawty know she stuntin like whoa and shawty know she lookin' right. Shawty know she stuntin like whoa! 
 Just like I told ya... After all of this over when da smoke clear from da dosha, still gon have U a shoulder fo to lean on. No roses, I don't need dat to show ya, I know ya feel it when I hold ya, dat I love yo ass more den anything! Den I'm sayen we done been threw da pain and all da rain, done dried up! Cleared all of my lies up. Feel like I done growed up and opened my eyes up. Focusin more on us. Let's face it we in love! And ya make me so mad till I hate ya so bad. But, I love ya so much and the break ups just never last. Sometimes this shit get too boring, know you tired of hearin I'm sorry, but I am. I took yo hand and walked and bought you with me, gotdam! Sometimes you be trippen, be forgettin what we have and when it come to fuck ups, baby you done had yo share. Yaaa, and you be forgettin dat and da reason why you sittin' where you sittin' at. 
 (Chorus: Bobby V.) 
 U know, I just been thinkin' dat when I get through hustlin, we gon move away, it's just gon be me and you okay, I promise. Right now I ain't got time, I'm on da grind. It don't sound right, U like my wife but all my life boo I just wanna be a timer. In just a few more months and a few moe blunts I can retire. Look at me, to keep you happy I do all dat it require and tell yo bullshit friends, stay out our business fucken liars! Yo birthday cumin up, I got yo present, hope you like it. If you got a real ass bitch, dat you in love with holla right chea! Hoes, I can't love ya, but I'll probably first night ya! Savage, Sweet Jones Jones ya back at it. If I'm with my main squeeze get back at me. I treat ya like my momma, but you know you my baby, don't you ever forget it, I know I ain't told ya lately, but... 
 (Chorus: Bobby V.)
