Woke up from a long night of sex this mornin 
 Brushed my teeth, got fresh this mornin 
 Hear my girl talk a lil mess this mornin 
 Hit the hood got a bag of that this mornin 
 Know I'm livin' good all them dog hoes on me 
 Good dope sells all over my phone 
 Know I'm finna keep it gangsta all over this song 
 Got my hands all over this chrome 
 Nigga act hard all day long mayne fuck that 
 Mayne I'll put it on my chain you won't bust a gat 
 Mayne let me take you to the backyard 
 Different color lacks boy 
 Half a mil' cash in ya hand y'all don't understand 
 Bricks in my pants say lil dude this grown man shit 
 Why is you sayin' shit, who is you playin' wit 
 I got a big house, who is you stayin wit 
 Till you can spend this type of shit on ya wrist 
 Y'all ain't makin' no money, y'all ain't makin' no money 
 Y'all ain't really doin' nothin', y'all ain't thuggin', y'all stuntin 
 Y'all ain't makin' no money, y'all ain't makin' no money 
 Y'all ain't really doin' nothin', y'all ain't thuggin', y'all stuntin 
 Y'all ain't makin' no money, y'all ain't makin' no money 
 Y'all ain't really doin' nothin', y'all ain't thuggin', y'all stuntin 
 Y'all ain't makin' no money, y'all ain't makin' no money 
 Y'all ain't really doin' nothin', y'all just fuckin' around 
 You saved up yo chips, to buy you a whip 
 Music with the big rims, boy you a trip 
 If you knew what I was worth boy I bet you would flip 
 And the majority of these bitches I done already ripped 
 These hoes rippin off a pimp (what!) 
 Tell that bitch stock earings hit me for a block to the wrist watch 
 Got a couple niggas up in jail, they ain't gettin' out 
 Webbie young savage trill fam we ain't sittin' out 
 Had my wife beater and my braclets and my pants on 
 Bitch I still had 85 grand on 
 Think I ain't demonic gettin' on then ya damn wrong 
 Play with me, I wouldn't even take a chance on it 
 Bitch put ya pants on, get ya ass gone 
 9 times outta 10 you ain't stayin long 
 Devil ass niggas I've been tryin' not to stand on em 
 Mayne I'm hot, mayne y'all need to turn tha fan on 
 We hit tha spot and get to blowin' it, pourin it 
 We gettin' money like we growin' it 
 A lot of hunnid 50 dolla bottles got us pourin it 
 Drankin till I'm throwin' it, I'll see y'all in the morning 
 See me put the tag in the window, just soarin it 
 My hips say I warn ya, my whip say I'm doin' it 
 All I'm sayin', man don't complain, I'll ruin it 
 I'll clean a hunnid grand out tha trunk and put you in it 
 Bitch niggas hate, niggas cake, niggas fake, a minute late 
 Album waitin, real estate, nigga ate like a buffet 
 And I just got tha new J's, these go good with my new shades 
 Stopped by the shop, got a new fade, gotta thank god for (?) 
 Straight to the hood to see some new cake 
 Aye that crown will mess with my shake 
 No matter where you go ima stay in yo place 
 If you ain't gettin' no money better stay in your place 
 Grim don't stop then we goin' all day 
 So iced out, it been snowin all day 
 Trill ent and we goin' all day 
 Y'all niggas broke and it's all in y'all face
