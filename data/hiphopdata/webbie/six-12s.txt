I ride down ya street you can hear me in ya den 
 Shakin' niggas walls when I put it past 10 
 G-shit, I ain't even gotta rap in 'em 
 I like to play tha songs with a lotta slap in 'em 
 The amp turned up so it sound like this 
 My girl ask me why I like it loud like this 
 I got the by 9s cross the back and I bet 
 You neva seen a nigga with tha pound like this 
 I ride by the club and e'vry body get loose 
 The hoes get to tootin', all the niggas get to bootin' 
 Don't nobody try me, know I'm quick to get to shootin' 
 I'm known around town as the lit nigga with the music 
 And I'm doin' all good and the cake not bad 
 I ain't lyin' if I tried I could break my glass 
 The police pull me over and they raid my cash 
 Man they be wishin' they could take my ass 
 I got six 12's

 I got six 12's you can hear my shit 
 Man, I really be trunken, man, I really be beatin' 
 You can hear when I'm comin', you can hear when I'm leavin' 
 I got it hooked up the sickest so ain't no since in competin' 
 Man yo shit is the cheapest, you might blow out ya speakas 
 And we blowin' and all, I got warrants and all 
 Done looked down at the phone, I done missed a few calls 
 Me and boosie was thuggin', ballin' out on the rent 
 He was tellin' me sumthin' but I couldn't much hear it 
 'Cause the music was bumpin', I could barely much see 'em 
 'Cause we was smokin' on sumthin' that we just got from Korea 
 All the hatas was watchin' as they was checkin' the paint 
 All the bitches was jockin', they look at us and faint 
 We done came to the top but niggas thought that we can't 
 Man this lil' nigga trippin', he done waste all his drank 
 On my brand new interior you know the leather is mink 
 But I'm way past straight so that ain't nothin' to me

 Now when I cut it up to 8 you hear that boom, bing, bow, bam 
 I block around the club, they be like ooh, we got dam 
 Everybody lookin', tryn to see who I am 
 Cut that numba 9 on when I play that trill fam 
 2 supa charged amps with the airconditioner fans 
 The pipes sound good and the motor is a man 
 Lil' mama wanna ride but I sorta made plans 
 I gotta go get my cousin 'cause he fresh up out the pen 
 Then I'm goin' scoop Webbie, he goin' park the drop top 
 Just got my 94 caprice up out tha chop shop 
 Six pioneers mounted up in a block box 
 Me and shell buckin' give a fuck if the cops watch 
 Old jams make then old folkes wanna pop lock 
 Check me if you want, get yo stupi ass glock popped 
 Every wipp a nigga ride gotta be top notch 
 We don't play a song in that bitch if it ain't got knock
