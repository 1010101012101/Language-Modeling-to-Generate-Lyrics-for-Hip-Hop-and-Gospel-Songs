You the realest I ever met 
 Realest that I've ever seen 
 And your body's so victorious 
 You belong in a magazine 
 You the realest, what's realer? 
 You the realest, what's realer? 
 I've been all around the world searching 
 And I can't find nobody else realer than you 
 Much didn't tell you... 
 All around me really every point you desert me down 
 Just mess around we the messed around 
 So I know they know me Muhammad Ali 
 I filth like a butterfly I sting like a be 
 I got a bad bitchy tamed you the MVP 
 I might sway too different around 
 Just wait until you catch that jungle fever 
 I can't let no one see 
 Real stones don't keep us coming 
 All life just like a boss life 
 And you know your boy life 
 You go all night like what's like? 
 Where the kush gonna lay us I ain't ever gonna cry 
 But take my heart I ain't never gonna die 
 So bitches still be sweet like I'm beating on high 
 Never take my league 'bout the same around mine 
 Imma leave you alone now 'cause I can see you've gone by 
 You the realest I ever met 
 Realest that I've ever seen 
 And your body's so victorious 
 You belong in a magazine 
 You the realest, what's realer? 
 You the realest, what's realer? 
 I've been all around the world searching 
 And I can't find nobody else realer than you 
 I done spend my love you done sold your paces 
 And I didn't know if it was gonna take this long but you still kept waiting 
 And you ain't seen none of that shit 
 Cause you know the real deal I'm the one they tracing 
 Girl you feel what I'm saying and I can feel your heart blazing 
 Can nobody amplify your body like me baby 
 You know you love me when you ride me and I drive you crazy 
 I don't know how I get so real 
 You know the streets made me 
 Sweet life and boulevards 
 Fuck around and had a baby 
 And I'm growing up and I'm showing up 
 But I'm blowing up 
 And every time I make a buzz 
 She say the same skill 
 You the realest I ever met 
 Realest that I've ever seen 
 And your body's so victorious 
 You belong in a magazine 
 You the realest, what's realer? 
 You the realest, what's realer? 
 I've been all around the world searching 
 And I can't find nobody else realer than you
