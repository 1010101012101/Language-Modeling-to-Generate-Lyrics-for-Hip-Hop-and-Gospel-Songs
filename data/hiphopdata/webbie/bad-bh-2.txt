See the whole thing like a whole thing 
 Call it cocaine 
 Got the whole money thing, no thing

 See independent like no man 
 See terrible like I don't? 
 Top knock pain I don't like flames

 Will you go to those club, will you fuck you with your girl, can you buy the whole bar 
 Hey, this is coming fucked up and what I'm sacking ? and no matter where I'm from 
 Do you try to stay clean, you can bob your high dreams like a bad bitch is all 
 Make a soda little sucker where I rubble when I catch you, you let 'em here rob 
 You got a Louie from Gucci, as I'm ? in your park and I get a little applaud 
 As your party and your play as you hit a little ? you play you're leaving God 
 Do you say afraid up 'cause your mind made up don't need your mob 
 Even think you're here and your valley out six ? six 
 If your ? is mine and I can tell behind

 Like every time she took the flow, she shot it down and I know she more 
 All that mick dawn I get the phone number, 
 All the rest young and get the wrong number,

 She grind to me, she a model pussy 
 I'm the only one that she would die for me 
 I lie fake so that is my cat and my bull when I got you

 I'm built like a statue, I'll strike like a method, 
 If I want you I can have you, 
 I'm still not born to smack you, and I greed for and I grip on 
 My ring ?? my nuts got the chicks on 
 And you know what we on.
