 It ain't no joke up in here 
 Got so much smoke up in here 
 You prolly choke up in here 
 If you ain't on dat dope up in here 
 Man, eyes are sewed up in here 
 'Cause I think it's roped up in here 
 Got this lil hoe up in here 
 And I ain't had a shirt since a year. 
 But I turn the wheel 
 The music fuck up ya ear 
 Snatch some mo 26's 
 Get you mo shit to go with it 
 We'll start here-bottom line 
 You clip 'em one at a time 
 You do this shit by the month 
 I switch 'em up by the blunt 
 So don't be stuntin-resepct 
 Chicks and boppas be on me 
 Yeah I'm prived in the projects 
 Andsome lil niggas that wannt in 
 In the asldjgkl some tints 
 Bad bitches some sence 
 I get tired riding this high 
 Hit the canceling switch 
 Yeah my lil homie came up with some extravagant shit 
 So I role it up and took me an extravagant hit 
 Got to laughing and grinning

 Started trippin' and chessin 
 So I rolled another one IMMEDIATE, ya know it

 Man I'm always in the ghetto, in the ghetto you can find me 
 Cadillac, swangin hard 
 Killas right behind me 
 Rollin' down the interstate 
 Doin' bout 90 
 This car is so smoked out, this shit is about to blind me 
 Gotta crack the window&let looseness fall 
 While I'm bending corners in my candy painted hog 
 Switchin, so packed like a mothafuckin log 
 Take anotha hit and then I pass it to my dawg 
 A doe doe smokin' gangsta, I stay twistin that green 
 But 28 gram a day have it, no what I mean 
 If I don't get my medicine, nigga on the cool 
 I'm bout to start trippin' out, actin' a motha fuckin' fool 
 That's when dr, jess will turn into hide on these boys 
 Pull out the heckler and start the pride on these boys 
 Well I'm buff, we ain't lettin shit slide on these boys 
 So we gon'keep our pistols and our eyes on these boys 
 That's wassup
