I bet you stay up in the mirror 
 Can't have a ol' man 
 Man how could he put up wit ya? 
 Everybody jumpin' in the picture tryna get ya 
 When it comes to bad bitches, you official 
 I know you keep somebody comin' wit yo fine ass 
 Too fine to be for just somebody wit yo fine ass 
 Masterpiece, you got some body wit yo fine ass 
 Wit yo fine ass, wit yo fine ass 
 (You got it) Rockin' wit yo fine ass 
 Rock, rock, rockin' like a fine ass 
 Masterpiece, you got some body like a fine ass 
 (You got it) Rockin' like a fine ass 
 She rockin' like a polo, be hoppin' like a yoyo 
 Come back to my other hoes, I say her sex was so-so 
 No offense, low pros 
 Glide when I slide 
 Y'all better recognize, don't be surprised that I blow mo' 
 Killa than a little, when I hit her tell her ride by 
 No clothes, she just come and go like a drive by 
 I ain't lyin' 
 I ain't know that that was yo ol' lady, no 
 Fuck and dive, you better eat and it's all gravy bowl 
 Ducked off, way low 
 Polish up on 40 toes and they do whatever I say so 
 Must I say mo? 
 10'4 big fine ass, she already know 
 She only fuck wit ballas, I can't ball her that's just how it go 
 If you can't get my night right, I can get ya life right 
 In and out of trouble, box of rubbers is the night life 
 Tosses I may think twice, 'cause she might bite 
 To the room and to the bed first, then I go head first 
 (Chorus (with Blake)) 
 I know you keep somebody comin' wit yo fine ass 
 Too fine to be for just somebody wit yo fine ass 
 Masterpiece, you got some body wit yo fine ass 
 Wit yo fine ass, wit yo fine ass 
 (You got it) Rockin' wit yo fine ass 
 Rock, rock, rockin' like a fine ass 
 Masterpiece, you got some body like a fine ass 
 (You got it) Rockin' like a fine ass 
 But can yo body match yo mind? 
 Can you think and still be fine at the same time? 
 When its time to float, hop in can I rock ya boat? 
 When I'm down, can you hold me down or let me go? 
 Let me know your attitude is actually my one rule 
 Ooh ooh you is just way too fine for one dude 
 Buyin' clothes, matchin' shoes, girl that's all you like to do 
 She got her own money so that's what she go the right to do 
 Can I be your everything? Yo red, white and blue 
 All the look what they be drinkin', bitch I got the juice 
 And I got the use, and you got the need 
 Hold on fuck all that Romeo shit, man who got the weed? 
 If you got the real, well then I got the g 
 Big fine ass, she'll make you beg her please 
 Done bout damn near everything, well I get that for free 
 And I get that a lot, knowin' that I need to stop 
 Rock them panties girl, use your imagination 
 Take you to paradise, go on a vacation 
 I just wanna get into you 
 Down for whatever so tell me what to do 
 Quick to take your clothes off, rock ya body down 
 Then I lick ya body back up, take ya to the ground 
 Beauty's an understatement when it comes to you 
 I just wanna please you 
 Rockin' like a polo? 
 (Chorus (with Blake)) 
 I know you keep somebody comin' wit yo fine ass 
 Too fine to be for just somebody wit yo fine ass 
 Masterpiece, you got some body wit yo fine ass 
 Wit yo fine ass, wit yo fine ass 
 (You got it) Rockin' wit yo fine ass 
 Rock, rock, rockin' like a fine ass 
 Masterpiece, you got some body like a fine ass 
 (You got it) Rockin' like a fine ass
