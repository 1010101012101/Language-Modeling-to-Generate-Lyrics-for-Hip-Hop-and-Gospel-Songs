Lets straighten it out x4 
 Now sit yourself down girl 
 When we started off girl you know it wasn't nothing like dis 
 Everything was all good we wasn't busten like dis 
 We used to cuddle all night now we touchen like dis 
 No open arms jus closed fist ain't this some shit how I fliped 
 And I barely even hug you no mo sometimes I get tha feeling I don't even love you no mo 
 And it feel like you don't love me 'cause it ain't like you been round here tryin' hug me 
 And why you always accuse me of being a cheat 
 Why you always holler'n choose me or choose tha streets 
 What its goin' take for me to say to you to make the peace 
 To let you know that you can trust me and I ain't tryn cheat 
 And then you wonder why I disappear for 'bout a week 
 'Cause I can't make no bread at home and boo we gotta eat 
 I think its time for all the pressure for to be released now let's get on tha same page baby you and me 
 Man why you always with that same shit asking the same ole questions about tha same chick 
 Girl wont you tell me why you stressing you my main bitch how many time I done told you 
 Stop all that trippen baby you who I come home to there go tha door you can go if you want to 
 No stay lets just talk it out like adults and get it straight and suck up on ya neck 
 And rough sex take place now you can smile again and lose the upset face your love is sensational 
 And can't no notha women replace ya and I break paper to lace ya in the finer things 
 So why you trippen about the minor things see you need to stick wit me I got all kind of plans 
 See this hustle her gonna get us all kind of things we goin' go and see tha world up in tha private planes 
 All I need you to do girl is stop playen games 
 Boo I love you wit all my heart and all my soul 
 You make me wanna go places I thought tha I'd neva go 
 But I just wish you understood betta dis cheeta thing 
 Girl you act like you like tha hood betta 
 A whole lotta shit done switched since I first meet cha 
 Before this bread we had a vibe dur the bread came den the vibe left 
 Ya heart I want cha to tell me what's inside dur 
 'Cause I don't know and I sho can't read ya mind dear 
 The last thing I'm tryna do is make ya cry hear 
 I'd rather see that pretty smile then see them tears 
 So now you just wanna give up after all them years 
 To throw away what we made come on keep it real 
 I put you befo all tha fellas that's how deep it is 
 You used to tell me everything now ya secretive 
 Like dr cliff and clare hugstable how we can live
