 Hit the parkin' lot by the club just swervin' 
 Headlights shinin' on my dubs while I'm swervin' 
 I keep an old pistol on my lap while I'm swervin' 
 Just in case I have to peel a cap while I swerve' 
 I play the six by nine's with the slap while I'm swervin' 
 I gotta have the killa and the yak while I'm swervin' 
 A four or five hundred dollar stack big swervin' 
 Smokin' on some doesha early Monday and I been swervin' 
 Since Thursday, red bones in the back got me swervin'

 Who holla shit like gutter gutter when you mention me 
 And Hennessy, man that hen got me swervin' crazy 
 I saw a dime turned my head and almost hit a lady 
 Slow down baby, with lil' bleet hollerin' in the back 
 I'm in my STS lil Jr. in my other lac, don't fuck with Hatch 
 'Cause I'll hit you with that Nina Ross 
 It's on your head bitch, you dead, I'll pay the cost 
 'Cause I'm a boss in the South side of Baton Rouge 
 Where niggaz swervin' on them twenty's and them twenty-two's 
 We act a fool, back in the game I used to go to dreams 
 In my firebird on them choppers with them fuckin' screens 
 Sippin' that lean, actin' like I never had shit 
 Bust your head in traffic, I'll wrap you up in plastic 
 Show your ass magic, abrah kadabrah kadoo here go lil' boo
