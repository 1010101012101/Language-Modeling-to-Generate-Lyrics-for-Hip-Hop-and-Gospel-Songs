 Man (man) this girl a dime with a penny at it 
 Lookin' like my future wife (wife) 
 Somebody let me at it (for real) 
 Damn baby it's the business and built for it 
 Sittin' on swole 
 Man I had to get some seals for it (for it) 
 I walked up and said 
 Let me introduce me (introduce me) 
 You lookin' like a star 
 We need to make a movie (make a movie) 
 She said it's cool and all 
 But you must not remember that 
 We made one in Septemba (Septemba) 
 Damn I must've slept on you girl 
 You, talkin' about we met before -- this 
 Gurl I must've slept on you 
 But shawty are you really sure? 
 I don't how I could of slept on you

 And I don't wanna sing the same song 
 But I don't know how I could of slept on you

 Ain't no way that I could miss you girl 
 Yo' face is worth my kisses 
 Plus you paint that perfect picture 
 You the baddess 
 And I never had a chick that has yo' status 
 So I'm glad 
 But all them hatin' chicks mad 
 Haha, laughin' in they faces 
 Guess they just gon' have to face it 
 Chaplain Cassius of your favorite bottles 
 Probably gettin' wasted 
 Layin' naked on the beach 
 Check the facial on yo' features 
 I mean features on yo' facial 
 All them divas they must hate ya like they racist 
 But they racial bro 
 Ballin' on yo' style because we colors you be wylin 
 Girl yo' tan is from the island 
 As yo' man, you keep me smilin' 
 Buy you handfuls of the finest 
 You the finest 
 Time is money, use the label 
 But your face is just so timeless 
 Haha!
