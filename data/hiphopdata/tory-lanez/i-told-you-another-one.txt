American raised, Canadian born 
 My name is Daystar Peterston 
 One day I'mma be the biggest artist in the whole world 
 As for right now though, the year is 2008 
 I'm 16 years old, this is where my story begins 
 Daystar, Daystar 
 I know you hear me calling you 
 Daystar, open this door 
 You know what, I'm done, I'm done 
 I'm so sick of your disrespect, I don't know what the fuck to do 
 I'm tired, you don't cook, you don't clean 
 You don't do shit 
 All I ever asked you to do was go get a job 
 You won't even get a job 
 But you wanna find yourself in the street hustling 
 Thinking that shit gonna pay off, it ain't gon pay off 
 It's not gon last, you gon find yourself dead 
 Real, oh okay, so you mean to tell me 
 That street life gon pay off for you? 
 Boy please, I'm just waiting to get the phone call for them to tell me to come down and identify your body 
 It ain't gon last. And this music stuff. Nigga go get a job. That's what you need. You need a job, I'm done 
 I'm sorry you lost your mom, but I can't take this shit no more. I want you to get your shit and get the fuck out 
 I'm done with your ass. Get your shit and get the fuck out. I'm done, get the fuck out 
 (I Told You) 
 It's the year 2008, I'm getting kicked up out the crib 
 Instead of contemplating where the fuck I'm bouta live 
 Mama died the same year my sister had the kid 
 It was either feed the fam or get killed 
 So a nigga said fuck it, 5 of us puttin' up for one room 
 Landlord straight buggin' 
 Roaches on the ceiling, living room straight thuggin' 
 Should've been left but the trap stayed bunkin' 
 Nigga yeah yeah 
 Big time, big time 
 Ring so swole you would think it did time 
 Swear I told you niggas for the 5th time 
 I'ma get mine, yeah 
 I got a ring so big, call the shit big time 
 She don't wanna fuck me, man that bitch lyin' 
 I've been on the get a billion dollar, rich grind 
 In the studio, I'm skating like a inline 
 Sorry I went Kristi Yamaguchi with the dough 
 Teachers called me stupid, now I'm stupid with the flow 
 Stupid with the whip game, stupid bankroll 
 Stupid ass nigga, getting stupid paid shows 
 I've been on the road 
 Now a nigga know my way around, yeah yeah 
 Big time, cuban chain weigh me down, yeah yeah 
 Flying private, I can turn the plane around, yeah yeah 
 These niggas pissy that we stayed around, yeah yeah

 Hop in another one nigga 
 Get back in another one nigga 
 Dip back in another one nigga, whoa 
 Hop in another one nigga 
 We back with another one nigga 
 Came back in another one nigga, whoa

 Hop in another one nigga 
 Then hop out another one nigga 
 Then back in another one nigga, whoa

 My wrist is froze like Kristi Yamaguchi 
 Skating on them, Kristi Yamaguchi 
 We watch a nigga talkin' at us loosely 
 Skating on them, Kristi Yamaguchi 
 You love the sound, uh, don't fuck around, uh 
 458, I dropped it in the Winter 
 Big homie asked a nigga what I'm down for 
 Looked him in the eye and said to do it till I'm bigger than you 
 I'm wop his ass on him 
 Kicked out the house in Brampton had a nigga trappin' out in Danforth 
 Take the TTC to get the figures, just me my lil nigga 
 Ain't had no hittas wit us 
 Was with the thugs, dealers, plugs, killers and slugs 
 All my niggas was plugs, all my bitches was dubs 
 Left me out when I was tryna make it deal what it does 
 Can't forget about a drop when they put 6 in my plug 
 Only thing I gotta do is get my Mom out the mud 
 Only thing I gotta do is get it poppin' and blowin' 
 Only thing I gotta do is hit my wrist with the soda 
 Niggas thought it was over, but bitch I live by the slogan 
 I told you 
 It's a 7-30 chance I won't fuck with you niggas 
 It's a 7-30 chance I might fuck up them digits 
 In the bottom where them niggas they ain't fuck with you nigga 
 Now you're up and they feel like they should be up with you nigga 
 I remember nights when I was starving and hungry and ballin' and bummy 
 And for-sick 'cause my car wasn't running and whoa 
 Dawgy all I want is a onion 
 The game was callin' me audibly like someone confronted, but no 
 Niggas never gave a nigga nothing 
 Fuck I look like giving niggas something? 
 Made 100K this week, that's on my dead mama 
 Spend a hundred seventeen and I ain't even know it 
 Dawg I swear my coat is nice and wasn't even snowing 
 Mama told me since a youngin' I would be a soldier 
 Played the watch out on the block you used to see me scopin' 
 Respect the shooters, that's a youngin goal, we bout to blow this 
 It's the year 2009 and I done found myself a crib 
 I ain't got no dough, but I done found myself a bitch 
 Dollars and success is what my niggas tryna get 
 Young as fuck but fake ID gon' get me in the VIP 
 I done said fuck school, fuck the teachers and the public 
 I rather count this money with the thuggers and the junkies 
 The teachers used to tell me "boy you ain't gon' 'mount to nothing" 
 The only love I felt was from the dealers and the hustlas 
 We gon' do the most, so tell them niggas go boast 
 Seen my nigga RV, and went and copped him a Ghost 
 Through the windshield, centerfold on the door 
 Ten below on you hoes, getting dough on you foes 
 Getting dough on these fours, getting money and shows 
 These checks are looking silly, I'm getting funny on hoes 
 Funny how I'm stuntin' and somethin' flooded in stove 
 Put them huneds on hold, put them runners on go 
 Secure the bank 
 I was fucked up, I had nowhere to go 
 I had moved in with my girl, you know she kept it realer than a lot of my niggas 
 She wasn't much but she was mine 
 The guns and the roses
