I took the 95 to get from West Palm 
 Think I need a break from everything 
 Yes, I'm stressed way more than usual 
 I'm gettin' things back in order 
 Getting things back to how they used to be 
 Back to when the scrutiny had no effect on you and me 
 I miss driving with you in the passenger 
 Feet up on my dash, we would see the sun lapse 
 Take you home, you would come see me before class 
 Makes more sense for you to crash 
 Won't leave with you, never ask, oh why 
 Told you there's no reason to be tied, oh why 
 I be waiting in the meantime, oh why 
 You always got me on stand by 
 When you know I need love 
 I'm missing when we was us 
 Miss when I wasn't famous, that's when we could be us 
 Kiss right in the street, fuck if anybody sees 
 Just friends, I don't think anybody believes 
 Hard to keep it PG with a nigga like me, goddamn 
 I fell in love with you, I fell in love, girl 
 I miss us 
 Nah, I won't front, got me so strung 
 'Cause you, you're 1 of 1 (hey) 
 It's no rush (yeah, miss it) 
 I'm missing your touch (your touch) 
 I'm missing your touch, oh 
 Missing when you kept in touch, oh-whoa-oh (oh, yeah) 
 When you kept in touch 
 I took the 401 to get from Yorkdale 
 You're still looking like the baddest thing I've ever seen 
 Defalted before it started flattening 
 Way before the singer-rapper thing started happening 
 We were playing checkers, I was just tryna get back to king 
 I miss black tinted windows on your whip looking Amish 
 I'm just tryna put it down 
 You can put it on my tab 
 I'm putting you on your back 
 Then putting it in you slow 
 Then putting it in on a track, oh yeah 
 And I always tried to fall through 
 Ain't now Ws and dubbing me when I call you 
 I'm in first class 
 Thinking 'bout how you would get me right 
 Damn near made me miss the flight 
 Fucking you and get it right, yeah 
 You gon' bring me to the first time we fucked on the futon 
 Back then, I would do everything to get you alone 
 You would know me, all bullshit aside 
 So am I lying? 
 I miss your touch 
 I fell in love with you, I fell in love, girl 
 I miss us (baby, oh yeah) 
 Nah, I won't front, got me so strung 
 'Cause you, you're 1 of 1 (you're 1 of 1) 
 It's no rush (yeah, miss it) 
 I'm missing your touch (your touch) 
 I'm missing your touch, oh 
 Missing when you kept in touch, oh-whoa-oh (oh, yeah) 
 When you kept in touch
