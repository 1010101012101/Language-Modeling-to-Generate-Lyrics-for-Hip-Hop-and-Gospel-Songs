Used to have a girlfriend 
 Now what I got is old 
 Just looking for a down girl 
 But she was fuckin' on the low 
 Hair done, nails did, caramel complexion 
 Pussy stayed wet like she was mixed with Mexican 
 Love I invested in, trust I invested in 
 So if she wasn't fucking with me I was stressing it 
 Wasn't no questioning, pussy was mine 
 Wasn't no questioning, Bonnie and Clyde 
 Still living in my momma house, but I let her move in 
 Momma thought I was tricking 
 But really I was just choosin', that was my bitch 
 I was claiming her when we was fucking 
 My bitch, wasn't using condoms no nothing 
 I was in love, she came first before my homies 
 Like fuck it, I'm 'bout to get your name tatted on me 
 Used to have a girlfriend 
 Now what I got is old 
 Just looking for a down girl 
 But she was fuckin' on the low 
 And that was me and my bitch 
 Knowin' that these hoes ain't shit 
 Me and my bitch 
 'Cause nigga ridin' on that Westside shit 
 Damn, I caught the bitch cheating 
 Damn, she was with him last weekend 
 What you mean you gon' call right back? 
 What you mean you ain't got time like that? 
 She fucked the nigga I knew 
 Ain't really fucked with his crew 
 I did a summer with his brother 
 And she fucked with him too 
 All that shit she was talking 
 She wasn't really 'bout it 
 And it made it even worse 
 When my homie told me 'bout it 
 I gave you your swag, told you to dress like that 
 I hit your spot, made you say "yes!" like that 
 And they ask me why I trust no bitch 
 'Cause my ex had me feeling all embarrassed and shit 
 Used to have a girlfriend 
 Now what I got is old 
 Just looking for a down girl 
 But she was fuckin' on the low 
 And that was me and my bitch 
 Knowin' that these hoes ain't shit 
 Me and my bitch 
 'Cause nigga ridin' on that Westside shit 
 Now she tryna get me back tho 
 I had her sneakin', creepin' through the back door 
 I was horny, I just wanted to fuck 
 I bust a nut in ten minutes I was in a rush 
 Reality, I hit it and she sad now 
 She pregnant, she know I coulda been a dad now 
 She text me like "I love you" 
 I text her back like "fuck you" 
 I looked down and looked up 
 Her best friend ain't shit 'cause my best friend hooked 'em up 
 But she know a nigga rich now 
 She text me like "I'm stylin" 
 She just wanna be my bitch now 
 Used to have a girlfriend 
 Now what I got is old 
 Just looking for a down girl 
 But she was fuckin' on the low 
 And that was me and my bitch 
 Knowin' that these hoes ain't shit 
 Me and my bitch 
 'Cause nigga ridin' on that Westside shit
