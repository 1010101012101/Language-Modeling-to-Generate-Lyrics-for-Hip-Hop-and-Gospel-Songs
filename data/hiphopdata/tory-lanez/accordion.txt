Walk in lay down you stay right here 
 It's my night to do you right. 
 I want us to stay here forever 
 Give you studio loving tonight 
 Tonight 
 If we don't stop this music we'll be dancing babe 
 And through the types you wear I see your lingerie 
 So shawty press the playback 
 Sit right here and lay back 
 Imma bout to blow you away. 
 Come and lay for me 
 Lay you out like an accordion 
 Let me press your keys 
 You can feel me touch em 
 Up and down

 You know I got just what you need 
 Come and lay for me 
 Lay you out like an accordion
