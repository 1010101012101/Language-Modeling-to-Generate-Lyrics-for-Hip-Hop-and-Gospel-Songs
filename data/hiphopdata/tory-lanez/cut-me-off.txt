Please don't cut me off, know you got the sauce 
 You've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off 
 Please don't cut me off, know I did you wrong 
 You've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off 
 Baby, I'ma pull up on ya late night, you know I'm crazy 
 Pull up in that brand new thang, you know it's Swayze 
 Say it's something cliche, fuck you, pay me 
 Playin' with that, I'ma fuck you crazy 
 Don't you cut me off, just love it off 
 Fuck you while in love, hit the Jimmy run it up 
 He so clean, shawty wanna suck me off 
 Ooh, we done done it all 
 We done done it all 
 Please don't cut me off, know you got the sauce 
 You've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off 
 Please don't cut me off, know I did you wrong 
 You've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off 
 She say I do too much drugs, got too much tings 
 Cut the bitch off and cut the lean 
 Kick the bitch out, tryna keep my rings 
 Switchin' my line, my phone don't ring 
 Bad bitches wanna be my ting 
 Drop-drop top, give the top to the king 
 Post straight drop while poppin' with the bean 
 Racks so big, can't fit in my jeans 
 Turn it to the boss out while on a B 
 Bitch, you ain't heard? Don't mess with me 
 One phone call, three casualties 
 I spend 20 racks casually 
 There's nobody I'd rather be 
 I don't wanna hear compares 'bout me 
 There's a couple girls I'd rather see 
 Better cut me off while you count on me 
 Please don't cut me off, know you got the sauce 
 You've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off 
 Please don't cut me off, know I did you wrong 
 You've been fuckin' with me so long that it's rubbin' off
