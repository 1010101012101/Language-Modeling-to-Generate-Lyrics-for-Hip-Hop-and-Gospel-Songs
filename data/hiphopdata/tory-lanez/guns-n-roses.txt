What if I told you 
 You're like the bullet to my holster 
 Dangerous but I wanna hold you baby 
 You're there when I go through the motions 
 What if I told you 
 I could sling you off of my shoulder 
 Just like a shotgun to a soldier 
 I bought you all these Guns and Roses 
 And baby, don't hold nothing back from me 
 I will hold your guns and roses 
 She shot me right down 
 She shot me right away 
 She shot me right down 
 She shot me right away 
 She shot me right down 
 She shot me right away 
 She shot me right down 
 She shot me right away 
 What if I told you 
 When we make love it's like war is going on 
 Don't leave me wounded in this battlefield 
 This fight for love, is for sure the prologue 
 What if I told you 
 You're my morning cup of Folger's 
 Would you stick me with this steep baby 
 Only by guns and roses 
 Don't hold nothing back from me 
 I will hold your guns and roses 
 She shot me right down 
 She shot me right away 
 She shot me right down 
 She shot me right away 
 She shot me right down 
 She shot me right away 
 She shot me right down 
 She shot me right away 
 Don't hold 
 (She shot me right away) 
 Nothing back from me 
 (She shot me right away) 
 I will hold 
 (She shot me right away) 
 Your guns and roses 
 Don't leave me alone baby 
 Shot me now I'm down ooh, wee 
 Don't leave me alone baby 
 I'm alone and I need another round 
 Don't leave me alone baby 
 Shot me now I'm down ooh, wee 
 Don't leave me alone baby 
 I'm alone and I need another round
