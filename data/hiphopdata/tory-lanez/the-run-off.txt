Yo Tory 
 (Got it on smash) 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh 
 Ay, it's a lot of pussy ass niggas tryna take my bitch and run off 
 30 in the bag must've caught it at the cut off 
 Feds pulled me over, took my weed and took my gun off 
 I know he the plug, but I swear I'm 'bout to run off on that nigga 
 I just light that bitch and hit my blunt off 
 You know what it is, all in my city, bitch you don't know 
 She keep saying I'm cocky, bitch it's just the way I come off 
 And I'm from Toronto I can't sleep without my gun on me 
 Popping with these ones on me, yeah 
 It's a lot of fun when the funds on me, yeah, yeah 
 Henny got me drunk all week 
 I can never let 'em get one up on me 
 Still these pussy ass niggas tryna take my bitch and run off 
 30 in the bag must've caught it at the cut off 
 Feds pulled me over, took my weed and took my gun off 
 I know he the plug, but I swear I'm 'bout to run off on that nigga 
 They lit the scene and I can't leave 
 Droppin' the top and I can't leave 
 Serious, no, you can't be 
 Err, you can't be, you can't be 
 Alright, cool 
 Yo Tory 
 I just feel so fucking free, you know what I'm sayin' 
 I ain't felt this free in a while 
 We ain't had this much fun in a while 
 Ayy, well, look I love my baby and I love my baby mama 
 But, it's like every time I see her, it's crazy drama 
 Last week, she damn near pulled out my .380 on me 
 Innocent, she'll probably still say I act shady on her 
 Ah ha ha, yeah 
 Baby, I'ma smoke this marijuana 
 And do what I wanna 
 Bitch, I ball, money tall, like that bitch Juwanna 
 I be all off in the streets, I'm doin' my thing and fucking these freaks, I got the .5 on me 
 Big thigh on me 
 She wanna ride on me, lil' mama, come slide on me 
 I'm on that big dawg status and we got them fives on Vs 
 And I keep my five on me 
 'Cause even your eyes can see, it's the 
 Pussy ass niggas tryna take my bitch and run off 
 30 in the bag must've caught it at the cut off 
 Feds pulled me over, took my weed and took my gun off 
 I know he the plug, but I swear I'm 'bout to run off on that nigga 
 They lit the scene and I can't leave 
 Droppin' the top and I can't leave 
 Serious, no, you can't be 
 Err, you can't be, you can't be
