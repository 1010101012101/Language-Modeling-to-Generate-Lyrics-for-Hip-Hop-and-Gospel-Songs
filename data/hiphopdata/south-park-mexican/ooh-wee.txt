 Baby Bash: 
 I know, you find it hard to believe 
 That I am, the genie of your lamp & I can 
 Do anything you wish but right now 
 I'm commandin' you to jam. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Ooh Wee 
 Scooby Dooby 
 Player pass it to me 
 Sticky icky oowee gooey 
 I'm straight out the boonies 
 Bang screwy in my Dully 
 Fingers residuey 
 My girl wants a purse so I bought the bitch a Louie 
 Got killers that are puny, sick and rather loony 
 Baby Beesh, Happy P & my little primo Goofy 
 I'm the bully with the fully automatic uzi 
 My jacuzzi full of floozies makin' dirty movies 
 Feed the needy with my CD, on TV in Tahiti 
 Wake up in the mornin' stretch and smoke my weedies 
 I used to be the poorest, ask Mark Flores 
 Now I drive around in a brand new Delores.

 Baby Bash: 
 Aye Chihuahua 
 Holla on the dollar 
 Baba, shake your nalga and smoke with Ali Babba 
 Got that goo goo and that ga ga 
 You can call me dada, in the Caddy or the Navi 
 Skatin' Dayton's on Impala's 
 Just like Michael Jackson I go Thriller for skriller 
 Pushin' green pearl and vanilla 
 Hand on my 9 miller 
 Baby Bash and SPM we don't like no cops 
 We finna turn the Dope House into Microsoft 
 Well there he go again, with that flow again 
 Actin' like he know again 
 Blow it up like Nickelodeon 
 Cleanin' up like the custodian.

 Gone off do do mixed with hash. 
 He's the one that licks her ass 
 He's your future and your past.

 South Park Mexican: 
 Bought my own limousine, 20 inch McLeans 
 5 screens, with 2 margarita machines 
 High beams, I mean, ballin' since 19 
 And I still ain't finished countin' all my green 
 A born loser, microphone abuser 
 Puffing on Medusa at the Lollapalooza 
 If you introduce her 
 I bet I'm gonna goose her 
 I've never been a snoozer, I'm a 600 cruiser 
 Comin' out of Houston with a mouth full of pollution 
 Mom wants to put me in another institution 
 I smoke a whole quarter but I've never been a snorter 
 Your boy SPM, I done swam across the border. 
 (Laughs)
