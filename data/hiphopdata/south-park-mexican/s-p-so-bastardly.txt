(Verse 1: south park Mexican) 
 I'm sippin' purple magic, gettin' stuck like traffic 
 On the back of his head SPM tatted 
 Boys down with me, like 4 flat tires 
 Got Benz's & 'Lac's & candy jaguars 
 Try to make it rich, breakin' bricks 
 My girl's name was cocaine, that's a crazy bitch 
 Was my first love, that I will admit 
 Watchin' dope fiends fight for half a cigarette. 
 Do these rappers know how it really go? 
 Or are they just another fake on the microphone? 
 I listen to the 'Pac, I listen to the Pat 
 My homey's either dead or in the kitchen cookin' crack 
 Boys wanna' stare, take it to the square hoe. 
 Should I stay ag' or should I let my hair grow? 
 I know it don't stop, even though they try 
 45 years in this like a homicide. 
 (Chorus: south park Mexican) 
 Creep wit' me 
 S.P. So Bastardly 
 And pull so fastily 
 And pack so heavily. 
 Creep wit' me 
 S.P. So Bastardly 
 And pull so fastily 
 And pack so heavily. 
 (Verse 2: coast) 
 The world has got me on edge 
 I'm gettin' closer to that spot on the ledge 
 To where if I drop, then I'm dead 
 Man, it's probably best 
 'Cause these days, innocent Mexican's get locked in the 'feds 
 Or either rocked wit' a glock fulla' lead 
 Or popped of the death?? 
 Now I don't wanna' be the next one to suffer the same pain 
 I'm stuck in same game, I hustle to change things 
 'Cause whoever says I just wanna see led fly 
 The bullets done sped by, now that's where your head lies 
 I be cruzin' down the back street, my screw tape bang 
 The caddy coop stay swangin' through the 2-way lanes 
 So come creep wit' me, let me show you the ropes I roll frequently 
 Out the dirty, throwed coast 
 What the deal like baby, this is real life 
 This is what it feels like, when you in the trill life 
 This is what it still like, still fly the kite to Los 
 I 
 d like to welcome y'all on behalf of S.P. bro'. 
 (Chorus: south park Mexican) 
 Creep wit' me 
 S.P. So Bastardly 
 And pull so fastily 
 And pack so heavily. 
 Creep wit' me 
 S.P. So Bastardly 
 And pull so fastily 
 And pack so heavily. 
 (Verse 3: south park Mexican) 
 I'm a stay strong, stronger then they thought 
 I made 'em so sick when I bought it off the lot 
 But I'd fall apart, if I couldn't spark 
 South Park, slap 20's on my Noah's Ark 
 Money ain't a thing, never will I love it 
 Guess that's why the Lord gave me plenty of it 
 I spent it on my homies, I spent it on my kids 
 I put a diamond necklace in my mama's fridge 
 But all the jealousy kept me drugged up 
 I try to stuff a fuckin' whole ounce in 1 blunt 
 So many enemies, for no good reason 
 Guess they mad 'cause I make the dough look easy 
 In the club, smokin' on a hog leg 
 With some car friends wishin' I would drop dead 
 Now that I'm on lock, they still can't take it 
 Homey, I'm the king of this shit, man face it. 
 (Chorus: south park Mexican) 
 Creep wit' me 
 S.P. So Bastardly 
 And pull so fastily 
 And pack so heavily. 
 Creep wit' me 
 S.P. So Bastardly 
 And pull so fastily 
 And pack so heavily.
