I'm SPM 
 You Know My Name 
 I'm the one that came up out the dope game 
 I've paid my dues and kept my cool 
 I'm the one that told yo' kid to stay in school 
 I'm from the streets 
 Thank god for rap 
 I creep through my hood in the smoke gray 'llac 
 Contridiction on my chest, Versace on my clothes 
 I got too many too many ha 
 yo 
 I'm shakin' bakin' cookies turnin' rookies into Vet's 
 I used to see my dreams through a foggy Pyrex 
 My Lex is outside plus I got a .64 
 But my Benz is wrapped up around a telephone pole 
 I'm drippin' candy wet & I'm swangin' 84's 
 Nothin' but the screw bangin' in my radio 
 I'm blowin' this mary & I'm sippin' on sherry 
 Give my homey's mama money for his convisary 
 My name is... 
 SPM 
 South Park Mexican. [x4] 
 Heh yo 
 Pass the greenary tweedle lee tweedle la 
 Livin' like a king fill the steam in my spa 
 Before I walk I gotta teach myself to crawl 
 I started off small now I'm stronger than the law 
 You Know My Name I'm SPM 
 In this rap game I'm the creme a la cram 
 I tell you what it is 
 And I'll tell you what it was 
 Exotic foreign minx and imported Asian rugs 
 Police at my door fedarali's on my phone 
 I guess I'm makin' too much money with my microphone 
 I did my time 
 No sunshine 
 It seems like they only wanna handcuff mine. 
 SPM 
 South Park Mexican. [x2] 
 Uh I used to be a shoe shinner 
 Now I sip Aunt Jemima 
 I go to sleep in Europe and wake back up in China 
 I take 'em break 'em down represent that H-Town 
 Carlos el Mexicano 
 In English Charlie Brown 
 My top is on drop and my trunk is on pop 
 My girl is snow white in the form of a rock 
 My hot block is in this in this rap I break again as 
 Blowin' in dough rollin' 20 dollar pinnas 
 Dancin' with the wolves in my Southern side hood 
 Got 7 brick houses all made out of wood 
 I'm either at the park where my homey's shootin' jumper's 
 Or in the limosuine gettin' freaked by head hunters 
 You Know My Name. 
 Chorus: [Till End] 
 SPM 
 South Park Mexican.
