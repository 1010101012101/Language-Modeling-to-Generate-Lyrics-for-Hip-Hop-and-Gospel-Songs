 For sho' home boy I'll be right there

 So I can blow 
 A 40 dolla sweet 
 Fulla indo

 Uh huh that's whut I does 
 I put dimiands on my daughters hair brush 
 In these times 
 Of hate and pain 
 We need a remedy, to get us out the rain 
 Jeliuosy, a little greed, 
 I've been thinkin', of what I need 
 Purple leaves, with crystal flakes 
 If it's not hydro please get that out my face 
 Two 25 for a half a oz 
 In the club with my homeboy joey t 
 My science project was in the school arena 
 'Cause I made a bong out this old steam cleaner

 *I need a sweet 
 With short red hair 
 And when I need this sweet

 To get me through the day

 From the west side down to the south

 Hell no lets all get high fly through the sky

 Till I die I'm gonna get my smoke on 
 And write a song while I'm hitting the bong all day long 
 Ain't nutin wrong wit that and if every you wanna chill better 
 Bring a sack it's like that ya get high off contact don't ever

 'Cause I'm on that paper man that's wrong 
 Caught with a sweet and a fat ozone 
 If you want that dope I got a boat load
