Broke cadillacs 
 Never lie on raps 
 Smoke killer herb 
 Till my lungs collapse 
 Lost 2 grand last night shootin' craps 
 Then I hit the rits and bought a few laps 
 Just got a letter from my old best friend 
 Doin' 25 in the federal pen 
 Wanna come home but he said until then 
 "Could I look over his 3 children?" 
 They wake him up at 5:00 for fruit loops 
 Draped up in white overalls and black boots 
 Used to drive a 'lac sippin' gin and juice 
 Now he need money for some chips and soups 
 Run around town with a sack of rocks 
 Polo shirts with the matchin' socks 
 Mom I promise one day I'm a stop 
 I'm a grow up and be an astronaut. 
 I'm on a Mexican Radio. 
 I'm on a Mexican Radio. 
 I'm on a Mexican Radio. 
 I'm on a Mexican Radio. 
 Now daddy come first and daddy come next 
 Daddy represent that screwston tex 
 Silly punks jealous of the SP Mex 
 But your whole crew should be wearin' kotex 
 I'm a get buy & I'm a get high 
 13 5 I'm a let my birds fly 
 Everybody knows that my back is not dry 
 If you say it is you a d-d-damn lie 
 Rollin' through life like a tumble weed 
 I'm the young pres of my company 
 Home catchin' hell 'cause I love my weed. 
 Baby can you please let your husband breathe? 
 Tryin' to dodge death and tryin' to dodge jail 
 Ol' damn friends tryin' to do my girl 
 People used to call me a bum from hell 
 Laughed at my car when my muffler fell. 
 I'm on a Mexican Radio. 
 I'm on a Mexican Radio. 
 I'm on a Mexican Radio. 
 I'm on a Mexican Radio. 
 Pull another bud from the bad ass dime 
 Grippin' wood grain let the seat recline 
 Got the asian girl with the big behind 
 Take her to the telly and she love me long time. 
 Remember when I begged you to buy my tapes? 
 Now I buy cribs on the sides of lakes 
 Pray to the lord and ask why they hate 
 'Cause they got the nuts about the size of grapes 
 22 inches on my dooly 2 ton 
 Every candy paint cost 85 hun 
 Even if I'm in my swimmin' pool havin' fun 
 Still I stay strapped with a water proof gun 
 I'm askin' you please can you pray for me reverend? 
 When I die will I go to heaven? 
 Try to count the TV's in my car I got 11 
 Pioneer read 1 double o 7. 
 I'm on a Mexican Radio. 
 I'm on a Mexican Radio. 
 I'm on a Mexican Radio.
