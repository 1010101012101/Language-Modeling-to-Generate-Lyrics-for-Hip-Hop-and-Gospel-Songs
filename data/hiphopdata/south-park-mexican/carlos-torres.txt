(Girl) Hey Carlos you got a letter today. 
 (Carlos Torres) What is this? Some more warrants or some shit. 
 (Girl) I don't know. It looks like another letter 
 From one of your buddies in the penitentiary. 
 (Carlos Torres) Oh yeah this my boy. Lets see what's poppin' 
 On the other side of that fence. 
 (Verso 1) 
 Say homey 
 Pass that scooby dooby please don't be a hog 
 Lets roll all the windows up and get lost in the fog 
 Poppin' ??? feels swell burn my finger nails 
 Its Christmas time so I'm banging screwed up Jingle Bells 
 Happy trails cooking quails strangers in the night 
 Voodoo spells look who sells slanging on my bike 
 My master bedroom comes alive I see 'em in the walls 
 My house was built with more yellow bricks than the fucking Wizard of Oz 
 People say that it's the easiest money a man can make 
 But you try facing death everyday or the freedom that the cops can take 
 (Coro:) 
 Beautiful kids making honor roll 
 Ten years later they on parole 
 Habitual criminal 
 Back in the pen 'cause that's all they know 
 As he reads what's in the note 
 His freedom only comes in an envelope 
 An envelope, an envelope 
 His freedom only comes in a envelope 
 (Verso 2) 
 To my niggas flipping bricks watch out for the law 
 I slang everything but all I do is weed and alcohol 
 I keep a gat in every place that you could ever think 
 I dream of people kicking down my door that's why I never blink 
 I'm from Hillwood and you can ask anyone who knows me well 
 I sleep with one eye open and I'm paranoid as hell 
 I seen good friends come and go victims of the game 
 Some dead some didn't have the time to flush it down the drain 
 My life is so remarkable it's a miracle that I'm here 
 I just spent 15 thousand bucks on a brand new chandaleir

 Beautiful kids making honor roll

 As he reads what's in the note 
 His freedom only comes in an envelope 
 An envelope, an envelope 
 His freedom only comes in a envelope 
 (Verso 3) 
 Bang bang bang, boom boom boom, 
 23 hoes in your homies bedroom 
 Nah nah nah nah, ooh la la, 
 Told you not to fuck wit dada 
 Now as you skip to my lou 
 Your gonna make me fuck you off on the cool 
 Mad at the world 'cause your money won't stack 
 Can't rap homey don't nobody want that 
 Eenie meenie miney mo 
 Grab a ho by the throat 
 I'ma have to wash your mouth out with soap 
 I'ma soldier, strike like a cobra 
 Muthafucking libra, born in October 
 Somebody shoulda told ya 
 I fuck with killas 
 Peace to my neighbors chillin' up in garden villas 
 I'm a damn fool, I'ma muthafucking trip 
 Why you niggas keep bumping your dick sucking lips 
 Now have you ever seen a man wearing pantyhose? 
 Then watch me as I put 'em over my face and go kill me some hoes
