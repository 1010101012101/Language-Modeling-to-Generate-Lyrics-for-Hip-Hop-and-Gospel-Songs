Screens Falling from the sky 
 Boys swing in all those 
 Lil' throwed folks 
 We sunny side for life 
 Candy on my '4, I'm so throwed. 
 (Verse 1: South Park Mexican) 
 It feel good givin' back to the hood 
 I'm tryin' to make up for all the dope I cook 
 And for all the dope fiends I woop. 
 Remember my first gun? I almost shot my foot 
 Surrounded by crackheads. I would wonder? 
 Will a nigga ever make it out this gutter? 
 Cops would come, all of us would run 
 There was 9 of us, they couldn't catch one 
 Good old days, I won't forget 
 While I write on this laptop in this jet 
 With the Universal Records President 
 And they say everything I do 
 I'm the first Mexican 
 Ain't no love and ain't no peace, bro 
 My 12 gauge shotty make your chest look like a pizza 
 Things I do, I'm a goddamn fool 
 I'm puttin' 17 strip dancers all through school.

 (Verse 2: Coast) 
 And you can find me in a parkin' lot 
 Parkin' a drop, hop in the X5 
 That's my SUV, yes my 
 Next time I pull up & 
 Some of that old crazy shit 
 I will roll down my windows and got 
 7 inches for the radius 
 Maybe it's the attention that I'm gettin' 
 When they spinnin' or maybe 
 It's just the liquor that I'm sippin' 
 And got me feelin' like I can't be taken lightly 
 'Cause I been poppin' pills 
 So you ain't gon' like me 
 I might be distributin' llello 
 Put you on my payroll 
 Supply you with a bird 
 But you don't move it till I say so 
 Make sure you don't take 
 No money out from under me 
 'Cause I'm the type of player 
 That's gonna run up in your company 
 Don't trust me 'cause I never sober 
 Usually I'm gone off for that 
 Pink or Purple soda 
 You better move over 
 I'm not far from vomitin' 
 Los and Coast's the shit 
 But still that diet ain't no stoppin' him.

 (Verse 3: South Park Mexican) 
 I don't give a fuck 'cause 
 We some hustlaz, friends we once was 
 Now I once blood, scratchin' on my 6 
 That's somethin' that a bitch'll do 
 I'll bet you squat down every time you piss out brew 
 Tomahawk, show these niggas your tattoo 
 While we bang Screw, Erykah Badu 
 Knock knock, pop trunk on the boulevarde. 
 How the fuck you gon' act like your pussy's hard? 
 Once again, S.P. Man, true killer 
 Fuck talkin' bitch, show me what to do nigga 
 Representer, bow before you enter 
 There's a reward for the man that can find my temper 
 Sick and tired of you jealous ass bitches. 
 Send you to hell and you can call me long distance 
 Don'tt run your mouth homeboy, you ain't deep enough 
 Get on your phone and go and call some more people up.
