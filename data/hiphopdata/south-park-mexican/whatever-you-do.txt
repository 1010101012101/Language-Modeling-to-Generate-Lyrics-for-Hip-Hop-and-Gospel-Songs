 Low-G: 
 Whatever You Do 
 Homey don't fuck wit my clicka 
 Mi Nina Rosa es me chicka. 
 Happy Perez: 
 Nigga what? 
 (Verse 1: Low-G) 
 I rolla from Houston to Minnesota 
 I got a chola 
 Wit coca cola en la cola 
 I thought you know ha 
 Comin' straight from Cinaloa 
 Ready to blowa 
 A muthafucker not a batter 
 A wetback is down and dirty for his dollar 
 You took the Chevy behind my back 
 No mi diheses in mi carra 
 Es slicka 
 Como diha con mi cuidaja 
 Con mucha perika 
 Don't fuck wit my clicka. 
 Low-G: 
 Whatever You Do 
 Homey don't fuck wit my clicka 
 Mi Nina Rosa es me chicka. 
 Happy Perez: 
 Nigga what? 
 Happy Perez: 
 Now everyday I wake up 
 (Inhale) 
 Lace my jay's up 
 Get on my grind fool 
 You best a pay up 
 And I ain't down wit that pay cut 
 My niggas will leave yo' fuckin' body 
 For the police to be tapin' up 
 Scrape it up 
 Gotta get mo' 'cause I can't get enough 
 These fuckin' niggas cryin' like hoes when they think it's up 
 Happy P man wetblack you can bet that 
 You bustin' at me 
 And I'm a bust back ya bitch. 
 Grimm: 
 That trip you bout to take 
 I done took it shit the best 
 This what was blessed 
 I looked my best 
 I took the ref 
 Then took the rep 
 I should confess 
 If it ain't fo' the chest 
 Then you ain't gonna take the test 
 See a man can't play wit nothin' less 
 In the past pump niggas got it pressed 
 Gotta keep 'em guessin' by the left 
 From the front or from the back 
 Gotta keep my 100 stacks 
 Ki's got it under that 
 Young and strapped with each hand 
 Since my hustlin' began 
 See a cop and fleed the block 
 Anyway a G can. 
 Low-G: 
 Whatever You Do 
 Homey don't fuck wit my clicka 
 Mi Nina Rosa es me chicka. 
 Happy Perez: 
 Nigga what? 
 (Verse 3: Rasheed) 
 Strategic leave 'em paraplegic 
 My legion run in Norweiga huh 
 In the demons. 
 Scream: 
 In the middle of the night 
 Your head will have you screamin' 
 Red cream dead fiends dead fiends 
 My team dugga a limousine with players a quarantine 
 Nigga wanna go to war 
 Go raw 
 From the east to the west coast dawg 
 Go to war in the front door 
 ???????? 
 ???????? 
 ???????? 
 My gina my nina rollin' in the ciyo 
 In the ghetto better known as the bario 
 Go strong 
 Blast long 
 I gets my blast on 
 Roll in the cast on 
 With a black mask on 
 Droppin' niggas till they gone 
 Wetblack. 
 Who is that? 
 What does it mean? 
 Come to the underground 
 Gun tactics visit the underscene 
 Coats pop 
 Muthafucker we shot 'em down 
 Rasheed got nuts stand on enemy ground 
 Don't speak 
 Ghetto melodies 
 In my brain 
 Silent wit jack o lanterns in this wicked game. 
 Low-G: 
 Whatever You Do 
 Homey don't fuck wit my clicka 
 Mi Nina Rosa es me chicka. 
 Happy Perez: 
 Nigga what?
