(Verse 1: South Park Mexican) 
 The game on tilt Dope House what I built 
 Beans get spilt and niggas get killed 
 Sleepin' on silk 'cause your head got peeled 
 Caught the hot slug blood spillin' like milk 
 King of the Hill baby mama named Jill 
 Naw I ain't trippin' uh maybe just a little 
 Peace to Big Will up in what Mackadosious 
 Ass naked hoes' doin' my promotions 
 Rats 'n' roaches baseball coaches 
 That was '82 now I stay by the ocean 
 In a 3 story while I while I read all this 
 Jap on my lap ass flat like Sigourny's 
 She's so horny outside it's stormy 
 Get my hydro from a nigga named Georgy 
 Purple 'n' sticky smoke like a hippy 
 In the game throwed till you hoes come and get me. 
 (Chorus: JC ad libs) 
 (Verse 2: South Park Mexican) 
 I spit from the neck once again I'm a wreck 
 I like chicken salad with the what vinegrette 
 Like my girl sassy southern and sexy 
 Creep on my jet ski they tryin' to arrest me 
 I'm like Pesci in that movie Goodfellas 
 I hang with dope sellers. 
 Dear God can you help us? 
 Roll a little forest for the ones who went before us 
 Nigga you ain't ballin' take them 20's off that Taurus 
 Appologizin' mama I'm so sorry about the past 
 For every time I didn't clean the house and cut the grass 
 Or the time I threw up on your brand new couches 
 Or that time you caught me cookin' up them 9 ounces 
 Drug dealin' son ain't much to be proud of 
 My only fucking goal was to sew the whole town up 
 I promised to get out of the game so many times 
 It's hard to explain so I wrote these lines. 
 (Chorus: JC ad libs) 
 (Verse 3: South Park Mexican) 
 I put the codeine in my soda pop 
 Cops lookin' at me like I stole the drop 
 What I can't have things like swing-a-langers 
 $1200 shirts on plastic hangers 
 I'm a +Star+ like +Spangle+ my chain gon' jangle 
 7 carat bracelet on my baby ankle 
 I'm a give my Seiko to my homeboy Pedro 
 I make hoes strip at every state show 
 Niggas wanna kill me I'll let y'all tell it. 
 You know how many times I heard that shit? 
 Y'all niggas sound like parrots 
 I'm a Green Beret y'all niggas green barr-ots 
 I hit you from the back but you don't land on your chest 
 I pop stress pills like Hammer Bars & X 
 I'm a buy things like Rolls's & jets 
 I left a mark in this game and didn't get no credit 
 I got a song called Hate & I can't even spell it. 
 (Chorus: JC ad libs)
