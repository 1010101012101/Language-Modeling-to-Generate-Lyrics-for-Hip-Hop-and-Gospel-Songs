Hold up on the double, these boy's want trouble 
 They call me flintstone and my homey's born Rubble 
 Rebel, Devil, chase em' through the ghetto 
 Breakin' these boys off with just 1 dedo 
 Metal bracelets, facin' worse incarceration 
 Aim for the dome tryin' to keep my concentration 
 Since Elementary, it was destined for me 
 To blow it up eventually 
 Late Friday. Or was it early Saturday? 
 I hit him with the shotty that I bought from Academy 
 Duck for cover, eat 'em up for supper. 
 Didn't mama say not to play with people from the gutta? 
 I smell undercovers, I die with my brothers 
 And when I'm on the mic. I represent all colors 
 Late night crummer, streets a than a silum, 
 You know the 3 digits, homes you better dial 'em'. 
 No matter where you at do you represent your city? 
 Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy. 
 Do you take fools out like the homey Frank Ditty? 
 Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy. 
 Did your crib get raided by this little 
 piggy 
 ? 
 Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy. 
 Have you ever whipped a billy till he really look silly? 
 Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy. 
 Baby Bash: 
 I suck the blood like mosquito, facin' judge Ito 
 Blunt in my mouth, lookin' big as a burrito 
 Turnin' 10 into 20, 20 into 40 
 40 into 80, everything is gravy. 
 Won't you play me in your deck-uh? 
 Microphone checker 
 Quick to grab a chickenhead hutch by the neck-uh 
 Double decker, pigeon's on my woody woodpecker 
 Suckers call me Grind say that I'm a homewrecker 
 Beretta underneath my Raider sweater 
 Freak the fine loca by the name of Wera 
 Stackin' more cheddar than speedy Gonzales, 
 Smoother than the head of Mr. Telly Savalas 
 Tu sabes haciendo jales, movin' yales 
 Order 2 tacos with the beans and nopales 
 Don't blame us 'cause Baby Bash is famous 
 And I got my fingers all up in your baby mama **** *****. 
 Do you raise Ben Davis or do you sag dicky's? 
 Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy. 
 Does your girl got your name tattooed on her *****? 
 Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy. 
 Do you bump 2Pac or do you bump Biggie? 
 Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy. 
 Do you sleep with your wife or with a 9 milli? 
 Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy Wiggy. 
 3rd verse: 
 I got sacks for sale in the land of hell 
 My enemies don't even get a chance to yell 
 In the black seville, with my man Miguel 
 Little beings wanna put a player back in jail 
 Stack my mail, where the bastard's dwell 
 Puffin' on Jane cause that's my girl 
 Never brag or tell, but I blast 'em well 
 I shoot more shots than Sam Cassell 
 Well, pick the chosen and form an alliance 
 Move in silence, we got the loyal clients 
 Coorporate giants, with street science 
 Cookin' dough on a kitchen applience 
 They try it, buy it and put it in they diet 
 Keep me out the hiet cause my room was a riot 
 Lyin' in Hawaii diamonds on my belt buckle 
 SPM like Tarzan, Lord of the jungle.
