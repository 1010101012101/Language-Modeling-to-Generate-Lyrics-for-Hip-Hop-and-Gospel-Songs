Intro: South Park Mexican 
 Uh, uh pick up my voice a little bit 
 Just a little man, just a little bit man, yo just a little bit dog, just a little bit, yeah 
 Flippin' ex-hoe trippin'... oh shit... 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Flippin' ex-hoe trippin' 
 Got them new kicks from that boy scotty pippin' 
 Still waitin' livin' skin off the chicken 
 And you hoes already know what I'm sippin' 
 Still a big dipper' 
 Still a straight killer' 
 Still unloadin' off that 18 wheeler' 
 Nobody better' never ever ever 
 Glass on my 'lac like that girl cindereller 
 Hand on my 'retter 
 Surf on the netter 
 Lookin' for a shredder in a polo sweater 
 Beat gets settled 
 Straight from the ghetto 
 Say you comin' back homeboy I keep espedo 
 Hillwood Texas, not many Mexican's 
 Except the one that got them 2600 engines 
 Don't ask questions, don't give answers 
 Sittin' at the bar 'cause I'm not a good dancer 
 It's the day after, pray for me pastor 
 Mix a little purple with the strawberry shaster 
 Or the cream soda 
 Rollin' in the cobra 
 Muthafuckin' thug born the 5th of November 
 Servin' that coka 
 It's la vida loca 
 Catch her at the club I'm a slap her then choke her 
 Still a baller haulic bought & I shot it 
 Call it what you call it, more brown bags than Sonic 
 Man I'm abra cadabra 
 Struggler not a straggler 
 Bubbler not a babbler 
 Hustler not a hastler 
 Never been a bachelor 
 Always been married 
 To these fuckin' streets 
 Stayin' long till I'm buried 
 Now I'm a swang, I'm a swerve 
 I think I'm seein' blurr 
 Wit my boy serge in the trunk watchin' spurs 
 Wit my persian princess 
 On 22 inches 
 When I sleep she say that my trigger finger twitches 
 I'm superstitious & I believe in ghosts 
 So many hoes wanna be with the Los 
 I'm tweakin' on the muthafuckin' weed that I smoke 
 Goin' 95 on my muthafuckin' boat 
 Ridin' them waves 
 Chunkin' up my tre's 
 Lobo call me up talkin' 'about he Wanna Raise 
 Crime show pays 
 Don't do braids, keep a low cut like that boy norman bates 
 Rattles and it shakes, jumps and it brakes 
 White candy paint look like the pearly gates 
 Sellin' my tapes in 50 different states 
 Fuck the radio 'cause you muthafuckers hate 
 But it's all good, I'm from a small hood 
 Tie his bitch ass up and bring him back to Hillwood 
 In my levi's sag down to my lugs 
 With a T-Shirt that say "breeders not drugs" 
 Be one of us, live in the rush 
 Just put diamonds on my baby's hairbrush 
 I fuck with the plus and not the minus 
 And I might just let my black 9 bust 
 And it goes like... 
 Uchie: 
 Uh y'all ain't ready for this 
 Nuh-uh y'all ain't ready for this 
 Uh y'all ain't ready for this, come on, y'all ain't ready for this. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 I tightin' up my lacy's on my brand new stacy's 
 Hug and kiss my babies then call up my crazy's 
 Tryin' to make it through another day no leasy 
 Muthafuckers hate 'cause I'm on top like ZZ 
 Young niggas think we out here playin' fuckin' games 
 Till one niggas lookin' at the other niggas brains 
 Laughed and you giggled about the words that I riddled 
 Now we step in the coffin' rock hard and dick shriveled 
 Hoppin' along in my '54 bomb 
 Yes I hate pigs like them boys of islam 
 Gone in the wind, not long till the end 
 No more talk in my glock in the palm of my hand 
 Alize at the mandolay 
 Got a call they shot 2 the rest ran away 
 That's how the shit gets done in the deep south 
 I'm in vegas watchin' vargas knock a bitch out 
 Ice glisten ballitician hold it down and dirty 
 Peace to all my fuckin' raza up in alberquerque 
 Sign a bonus with the yerky now my house is roomy 
 Niggas wanna do me but you bitches nothin' to me 
 Understand my killers love makin' haters bloody 
 Actin' buddy buddy softer than silly putty 
 Hangin' by a rope and gut 'em like you do a goat 
 And on his neck write this on a fuckin' note 
 Bitch pissin' in the wind what began has begun 
 Blast my heat once sweep 'em up and be done 
 I'm one in a catrillion, muthafuck a million 
 Layin' in my bed gettin' head from a brazilian 
 Mama still bitchin 
 Gangsta's still listen 
 I'm blowin' weed with them boys from New Edition 
 Man I'm ballin' 
 Never ever fallin' 
 Skip to my lou my muthafuckin' darlin' 
 And it goes like... 
 Uchie: 
 Uh y'all ain't ready for this 
 Y'all ain't ready for this 
 Uh y'all ain't ready for this 
 Nuh-uh you no ready for this, listen. 
 Uchie: 
 So if you see 'em see 'em, go head tell 'em tell 'em 
 Only music is my dope & I sell 'em sell 'em 
 Or I slang 'em slang 'em 
 It don't matter what you call it 
 My shit so hot up in the hood you better record it 
 Now some of y'all niggas think my heart is so warm 
 Cold muthafucker me, you don't want none wutter fucker 
 Have your whole crew ducka ducka 
 It happens when I pull out my 9 milla placa 
 Nigga watcha be careful 'cause my blood gets hotter 
 Chunk that bullet out my gun than stopper. 
 Remember when I used to be a mic wrecker? 
 By the grace of Yahweh I come to be the mic checker 
 Now it's better, now that I'm makin' that cheddar 
 My belly stay full and my throat was never wetter 
 Hey Rebecca, meet me at the back stage letter 
 'Cause when I go down there' we're gonna go down to Jamaica. 
 That's what I'm talkin' about 
 See ya later 
 Uh y'all ain't ready for this. 
 Yeah, that was kinda tight wasn't it? "Yeah" 
 All right.
