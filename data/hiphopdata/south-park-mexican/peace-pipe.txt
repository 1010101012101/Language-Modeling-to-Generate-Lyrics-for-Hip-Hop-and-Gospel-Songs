What's really goin' on? 
 My people we onna rise 
 If we just open our eyes 
 Can you see what makes us weak? 
 Killin' each other for a color 
 Right now as I speak 
 Understand the cowards act fools 
 But the bravest of all men obey gods rules... 
 South Park Mexican: 
 I see my streets full of hustlaz sellin' dope 
 Creepin' trophy trucks and buss off killer smoke 
 I see older folks turn away 
 They disgusted all the money that I earn a day 
 And they been busted but everybody paid for 
 The way they live may I be on my way lord 
 I make a wish, I see muthas on crack 
 G's gotta serve them everybody wanna stack. 
 Keys it don't hurt them cold blooded will it ever be? 
 Ain't no love you can die and still never see 
 That the blood that you spillin' is your own kind 
 Now take a look who you killin' when you go blind 
 All the years sellin' bricks black taught me well 
 That life only gives back what you can sell 
 And this message is colored by aspairity 
 So out of lessons these streets wanna marry me 
 And it's on... 
 We're gonna take control 
 Take a place out to toro 
 You know we got to blow 
 That Peace Pipe, Peace Pipe... 
 We're gonna take control 
 No matter where we go 
 You know we gots to blow 
 That Peace Pipe, Peace Pipe... 
 Lil' Russ: 
 Stop the greed as I proceed to blaze 
 And recollect my thoughts 'cause we livin' in the last stage 
 Of revelations doomed for a devistation 
 So before I die, I'm a bring about this unification 
 Spread love all across the whole nation 
 Sheedin' tears for my peers and all this shit we facin' 
 Cause lord knows, this mexicano had it bad 
 Just like the rest of my people had in the past 
 They been in misery sufferin' through proporty 
 But I'm a help my brothers through this trouble G 
 Lil' Russ well let it be known worldwide 
 So I'm a reunite mi gente till we unify. 
 We're gonna take control 
 Take a place out to toro 
 You know we got to blow 
 That Peace Pipe, Peace Pipe... 
 We're gonna take control 
 No matter where we go 
 You know we gots to blow 
 That Peace Pipe, Peace Pipe... 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Bandana's flaggin' everywhere, clamin' sets 
 Gangsta's playin' double dare, aimin' techs 
 Many people heard of me when I was lost 
 Involved wit a dirty deed wit nino ross 
 Homies was the full dad 
 I was at the party wit my steel hammer pulled back 
 Thank god he turned into a better man my second chance 
 But I don't think I ever can forget the past 
 We was kids playin' football havin' fun 
 Now we playin' 'shootin' y'all' wit real guns 
 One time for my dead friends I do my best 
 So the trigger happy trend ends 
 So you may rest... 
 We're gonna take control 
 Take a place out to toro 
 You know we got to blow 
 That Peace Pipe, Peace Pipe... 
 We're gonna take control 
 No matter where we go 
 You know we gots to blow 
 That Peace Pipe, Peace Pipe...
