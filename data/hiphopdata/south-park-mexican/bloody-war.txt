We heard the word now, we know just what your thinkin' 
 You want us dead now, you want to see us sinkin' 
 We have no choice now, this is the game you've chosen 
 My klick is killer, just like the dank I'm smokin' 
 It's time for action, time for retaliation 
 You ain't a real G, been watchin' too much Jason 
 You want my fist around clips 
 May you sleep in peace with the fish, you's a hoe 
 & in the pen you be a bitch 
 Usin' red M&M's for lipstick. 
 They want to go to Bloody War. 
 Are you sure you want to take me to war? [x2] 
 I got my G's, I got my team 
 Put me down for murder in first degree 
 My clip is full, but that'll change 
 Heard you got your vest on, but I want brains 
 It's lonely days & lonely nights 
 'Cause I need my revenge, right by my side 
 My gun is hot, my heart is cold 
 Everyone around me has killed before. 
 They want to go to Bloody War. 
 Are you sure you want to take me to war? 
 I snatch your bitch, then snatch your life 
 & keep your fingers, for braggin' rights 
 Next week you'll be washin' my troka 
 'Cause your ass ain't shit but a panocha 
 You got a choice, die or be miserable 
 Dope House, home of the invisible 
 I warned y'all to stay off my genitals 
 Now I gotta turn you fruits into vegetables 
 Havin' nightmares, homey you ain't dead yet 
 Wakin' up with your muthafuckin' bed wet 
 I have fun with fuckin' punks like you 
 Tell his mama not to worry he'll be dead by 2:00 
 His head, impounded, they never found it 
 He in the dirt, you can say he got grounded 
 I'm a shouter, live it how I tell it 
 & if you see him, tell him I said... 
 They want to go to Bloody War. 
 Are you sure you want to take me to war? [x2]
