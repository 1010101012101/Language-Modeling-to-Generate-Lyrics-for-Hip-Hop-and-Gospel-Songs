Uh, I put's it down 
 Uh, 1 2 3. 
 (Verse 1: South Park Mexican) 
 Mirror, mirror on the wall. 
 Am I the purest of them all? 
 Am I the one to ease the pain? 
 Make them fall to they knees and pray 
 Mama said son you've got to go 
 You turned my house into Stop 'N' Go 
 Out the door, please don't call 
 Till you stop sellin' snowball. 
 SP Mex remember me? The one that deserved penitentiary 
 With the sack of green but no gasoline 
 Peace to my boys up in Pasadene 
 It's all sweet and beautiful 
 Shine my nails and cuticles 
 My duely truck got 7 screens 
 Watchin' "Me Myself and Irene". 
 High Everyday 
 Dope House G's 
 Who never die 
 Just stay high. 
 (Verse 2: South Park Mexican) 
 Fuck you, you can hate it or love it 
 Twist the top off the 40 and chug it 
 Chop rocks off of Chicken McNuggets 
 Cook 28 and get 39 from it 
 B12, miracle whip 
 46 ounces off 1 brick 
 Booka, Shooka, what I slang 
 In the sunshine or in the rain 
 Fuck the fake don't fake the funk 
 Buy my batch and bake it up 
 Taste my dope and numb your mouth 
 Pure cocaine straight from the south 
 Dumpin' led in Houston Texas 
 Got you bitches jumpin' fences 
 Runnin' for your very life 
 Slang Al Green and Barry White. 
 High Everyday 
 Dope House G's 
 Who never die 
 Just stay high. 
 (Verse 3: South Park Mexican) 
 Lookin' leaned out up in my whip 
 Smokin' that drip, drop, drip 
 Wishin' up on a star, like Christina Aguilar 
 Flip through Hillwood, visit Mama 
 She raised me without a Father 
 Tried her best and nothin' less 
 Still I'm sellin' 'caine and sess 
 Played the trumpet, played the flute 
 Please don't be afraid to shoot 
 SPM, mean Carlos Coy. 
 Whatcha say mom? "That's my boy" 
 Now I'm rappin' and producin' 
 No more H-Town, call it Screwston 
 Just say no to hate 
 But me, just stay... 
 High Everyday 
 Dope House G's 
 Who never die 
 Just stay... 
 High Everyday 
 SPM 
 Who'll never die 
 Just stay high.
