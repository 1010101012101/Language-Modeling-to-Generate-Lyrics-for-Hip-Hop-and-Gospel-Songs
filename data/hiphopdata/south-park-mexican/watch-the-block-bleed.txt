(Dialogue between Ikeman and Grimm) 
 Ike how long I been doin' this here 
 Man at least 10 strong for sure 
 10 strong... that's a long time 
 I'm tellin' you 'cause you can make them boys bleed nigga 
 It's about time to get it homey 
 I think these boys done forgot who started it. 
 Who started this? 
 I started this for all these Mexicans down south 
 All I know is I bet these boys don't want none of this flow 
 Hold up Grimm... man keep that shit. 
 My mom's told me to keep my friends close 
 But keep my enemies closer 
 Like Scarface and Sosa 
 Goin' to war with soldier's 
 But hold your head high 
 Ain't gonna lie 
 Stayin' alive is harder than you realize 
 Goin' to be a day to die 
 Still I'm a try 
 'Cause I got the hood up in my veins 
 And it's pumpin' through my body 
 Collision course 
 Runaway train 
 Some of the same muthafuckers that I'm runnin' with 
 Got that gun on the hip 
 And if I won a lick who you think they comin' to get 
 Dumber than shit 
 I'm gonna hit 
 Anyone that want to plex 
 S.E.H T-X 
 Who gonna hate me next 
 I got the means to make the most of every move you make 
 You need to choose your fate 
 Don't be no fool and wait 
 Hesitate in this game and you're gone 
 Niggas paid just to aim at your dome 
 Everyday I pray to get home 
 I got my blade and my chrome 
 And I'm known for gettin' blown 
 So ignite the flight 
 And those who heard it dropped the mic 
 Don't believe the hype. 
 This is for the hustlers and this is for my G's 
 This is to them busters that try to take my cheese 
 I got too many youngsta's that's out there on the streets 
 And we doin' what we wants to 
 Now Watch the Block Bleed. [x2] 
 It's no mystery when I'm in ride mode 
 It's Cuervo and hydro 
 Match the man apply those 
 Skills that let me highroll 
 Down low 
 Deep inside the south is where I'm from 
 Number 1 done got you stung 
 From the motion of the tongue 
 Lookin' sprung like a fiend 
 Weighed my dreams on triple beams 
 Made the tean plush cream 
 Lifestyle at 15 
 Flipped my money faster than I could spend it 
 Some got jealous some offended 
 When did you get the idea 
 That I was supposed to play the bitch 
 Tapin' hits 
 Takin' flicks 
 All and not to make it rich 
 Made the switch 
 Now I'm just steppin' 
 Ain't no lookin' back 
 Knowin' that the game 
 Ain't no different than the cookin' crack 
 Crook to mac 
 That's my life in a phrase 
 Hard feelings, I don't got 'em 
 Lookin' for the better days 
 Bet it pays 
 And if it don't, well I did my best 
 Just a sinner in the flesh 
 Tell me can I get my rest. 
 This is for the hustlers and this is for my G's 
 This is to them busters that try to take my cheese 
 I got too many youngsta's that's out there on the streets 
 And we doin' what we wants to 
 Now Watch the Block Bleed. [x2] 
 I raise my right hand to the man 
 And pray that he helps me through the day 
 I know it's times if not for him 
 That I'd be dead and on my way 
 For every bullet in the night 
 That missed me whistlin' passin' by 
 Turnin' my eyes toward the sky 
 Thank the Lord that I'm alive 
 Other times out on the streets 
 Them fadin' fools that bring in heat 
 Paid the crew to make the creek 
 And take that fool out in his sleep 
 Now don't blame me for the way it is 
 In this day of doin' business 
 I could ask for my forgiveness 
 But I can't acy as if I'm sinless 
 What I know is I can only be as strong as my weakest link 
 I can lead that man to the water 
 But it's up to the man to drink 
 Now stop and think before you sink 
 Within' the time it takes to blink 
 Tattooed tears fall from the eyes 
 Made with homemade ink. 
 This is for the hustlers and this is for my G's 
 This is to them busters that try to take my cheese 
 I got too many youngsta's that's out there on the streets 
 And we doin' what we wants to 
 Now Watch the Block Bleed. [x2]
