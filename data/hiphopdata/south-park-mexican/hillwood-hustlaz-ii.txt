 1st Verse: 
 I'll take my gun and make you run cause it really don't make me numb. 
 Slip through the hood dope I cook. 
 Livin' my life the best I could. 
 Robin hood the youngest crook here they come now watch out look. 
 Go by the book, jaws I shook. 
 It's that Mexican dance with wolves. 
 Swimmin' pools we some fool's diamonds and them ruby jewels. 
 Makin' moves, haters lose, just last week I made the news. 
 They accused but I won't lose 
 Mama's happy, Daddy's cool. 
 What about you? "What do you do?" 
 If you young, stay in school 
 We stay true, Dope House crew 
 Smokin' yabba dabba doo 
 Jam this crew, we brand new 
 Followin' up this plan I drew 
 SP-Mex bubble jet 
 Countin' dollars and them cents 
 Kick your door down and have you tryin' to jump your own fence.

 2nd Verse: 
 You haters ain't no friend of mine 
 Boys don't wanna let me shine 
 That's all fine, take in mind 
 Bust a rhyme, like a 9. 
 How many times do I have to tell ya? 
 All my life I've been called a failure 
 Write my friends in the pen 
 "Are you gettin' these letters I mailed ya?" 
 Rock and roll, opthimals 
 Then go eat at Papa Dough's 
 So many hoes in the club 
 Pull my cash and buy them all a rose 
 84, the story goes 
 On about that boy Carlos 
 Sippin' 4's, hittin' dro 
 But never put nothin' up my nose 
 Body froze, casket closed 
 Nightmares of the life I chose 
 Try my dope and overdose 
 Suckin' up my killer flow 
 Freestyle pro, style: girbauds 
 Silky socks and matchin' clothes 
 Mama told me life was like ballet, you gotta stay on your toes 
 Crackin' jokes, spin a spoke. 
 Silly question, do I smoke? 
 Breakfast? "Milk and Quaker oats" 
 80 thousand dollar boat 
 Better not puff, better not pout 
 SPM is in your town 
 El Coyote in el mote, a.k. Senor Charlie Brown.

 3rd Verse: 
 The barbarian 
 Look where we buried him 
 In the hole, right next to the librarian 
 I married in, to the very end 
 Have your kids askin' "Daddy, who are those scary men?" 
 Make a strapper bitch, wanna be my fuckin' wife 
 She told me: "This the biggest tip I ever got in my life." 
 Nothin' can save us, starched, stuffed Ben David 
 Sellin' dope to my coked out neighbors 
 First full trip and let my clip get to rippin' 
 Blood drippin' out his shit, tryin' to run, but he limpin' 
 I come from the slums, survived on crumbs 
 I live like a man & I'm a die like one.
