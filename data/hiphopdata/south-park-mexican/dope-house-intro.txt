Dope House Records... 
 Dope sells itself, 
 biatch! 
 The real always gonna recognize the real... 
 If y'all muthafuckers want some 
 Then come get you some partner. 
 1st and only verse [South Park Mexican]: 
 For every city that I come to 
 This for every bitch that I run through 
 This for every hater in the Universe 
 Stayin' one step ahead, I'm shootin' first 
 For every killer lookin' for some employment 
 I'm a nigga that you don't fuckin' toy with 
 This is for my enemies and homies 
 If you got a strong family then join me 
 Everything I say, be safely said 
 While me and my niggas keep breakin' bread 
 Don't hate the Mex, it's obvious 
 That you don't wanna see my people prosperous 
 In God We Trust, put down your guns 
 For my niggas locked down for a thousand months 
 I'm a bounce and bust, sell an ounce of dust 
 The wetback, I suggest you get down with us. 
 Courtney Jones: 
 Welcome to the Dope House 
 Welcome to the Dope House 
 This is for my killers, killers, killers 
 This is for my killers. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Peace to my home boy Mansa.
