South Park Mexican: 
 It's after midnight while I let this pen write 
 In my cell it's just me and this dim light 
 As my thought's get's spilled on a notebook 
 They shot my homey & I told his girl don't look 
 'Cause if she saw what I saw it would have haunted her 
 I heard the paramedics laughin' with the officer 
 I guess they see it as just another dead body 
 And I know it hurt when his daughter said "Mommy. 
 Where's Daddy? I ain't seen him in a long time." 
 How can Mommy talk? She can't even stop cryin' 
 The punch line is tomorrow may never come 
 That's where the cops get 1 8 7 from 
 It means murder not death by natural causes 
 It means homey's clothes redder than Santa Clauses 
 In Hillwood many died facin' obstacles 
 I thank God it's not me in that pile of skulls. 
 Slugs around the block boys 
 Thuggin' till they drop laws 
 Puttin' G's on lock 
 So we flush it when they knock 
 Caught up in the system 
 These haters play the victim 
 Wanna see us fall 
 Like Dead Pictures on the wall. 
 Jak Da Ripa: 
 I saw the reaper in my sleep so I might got a death wish 
 When vultures come around I react so selfish 
 If you ain't out of the hood you probably think that I'm crazy 
 Lot of niggas in jail or they pushin' up daisies 
 I'm true to myself, this the way God made me 
 Love my mama to death 'cause she's the one that raised me 
 So many muthafuckers droppin' out this shit like flies 
 Heard a friend of mine just committed suicide 
 Left his family behind found him hangin' from the ceilin' 
 Eyes wide open I just can't imagine the feelin' 
 So many funerals here I am in all black 
 Prices put up my head so I'm packin' a strap 
 When my life is on the line I bring them killers out 
 I find your residence and bring the drama to your house 
 Now all what's left is a memory of your existence 
 Dead Pictures on the wall bloody murder's my vision. 
 Slugs around the block boys

 South Park Mexican: 
 They found my homey Desperado in a garbage heap 
 Wrapped up throat slit man the scars are deep 
 That day it felt like the whole city was cryin' 
 Lil' D if you hear me nigga give me a sign 
 That dude that had murdered you got twisted by Jason 
 Had to tell you 'cause I know that y'all in different locations. 
 Have you seen Lil' Lex? The other day he was killed 
 Niggas don't got no hustle had to take what he built 
 I'm afraid to even open up today's newspaper 
 'Cause the Crow is takin' souls like the old Shoemaker 
 It's enough to make you blow up, throw up or go nuts 
 My people dyin' & I fuckin' love 'em so much 
 My homey's brother got killed in a car chase 
 Cops tried to pull him over back on Park Place 
 He hauled ass but it ended when he crashed his Taurus 
 And all he had was some muthafuckin' traffic warrants.
