I gotta palomino horse with versacci saddle 
 Ima cocaine cowboy with crops 'n' cattle 
 Half dog and jackal pop Don like snapple 
 Got my first paycheck when I robbed the randall's 
 Flow hot like campbell's change broads like channels 
 Two or three at time 'cause we all just mammals 
 The songs I sample bought my mom a castle 
 Bought pops a fuckin' non filter box of camels 
 Comp soft 'n' fragile get stomped and trampled 
 While they bitch in my car tryna bob for apples 
 Sport glocks in flannels with the common vandals 
 Takin' hits off homemade bong with handles 
 It's a lawless battle as my toughts unravel 
 Pull my gun and like eggs niggaz dodge and scramble 
 Still lost in travel and my hearts in shambles 
 While the seeds in my weed snap pop 'n' crackle 
 Who fuks with the rhyme of the dope house mind 
 Who shines in the dark in these end of times 
 Line after line who keep it the realest 
 [Carolyn:] Only you 'cause the others to scared to live it 
 I do videos with a bunch of pretty hoes 
 In a benz wearin K-mart dickie clothes 
 Give a toast listen close to dat nigga Los 
 When we was hungry Mom would say "Get the fishin poles" 
 Really thou back when I sported chilli bowls 
 And used to dream about rappin' on Jenny Jones 
 My city thowed stop actin' lik you didn't know 
 Gettin' rich 'n' we still screamin "Gimme mo!" 
 In the props gotta stay on ya tippy toes 
 They tryda kill me few bullets came really close 
 Now tha bitch is froze twisted in a wicked pose 
 And his toes colda than my Michelobs 
 Diggin holes lik ima tryna find some hidden gold 
 He got nice shoes, wonda if I fit on those? 
 The sickest flows, I got guns dat can kill a ghost 
 At the club wearin dead man's Kenneth Coles 
 Candy blue 5 parka and a moonlight sparka 
 Let me tell ya 'bout the life of a pure white rocka 
 A true live balla, might cruise my 'pala 
 Or just soak in the sun and take poolside calla 
 It's the hood fly talka and if you lik drama 
 Ima da rappa dat'll rap ya in a two-ply potna 
 With fruit flies gonna my ginsu knife sharpa 
 Den dat thang they was swangin at the Luke Skywalka 
 Listen boo, I gotta notta screw tight on tha 
 Fukin brain that ain't been sane since a cute shy toddla 
 My new nine's hotta than a July jogga 
 Or even me on the news sayin' "Ooh hi Momma" 
 Neva knew my fatha till I grew quite larga 
 But by the I was ten walkin' through high water 
 Old dude tried harda then a suicide bomba 
 I'm like "Dad is too late, Ima foo, why botha"
