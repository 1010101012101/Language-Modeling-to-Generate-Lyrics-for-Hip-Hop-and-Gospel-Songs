Yeah. Yeah. 
 Now come follow me 
 Down Yellow Brick Road 
 To Wizard of Oz 
 Hillwood Hustla 
 Got what you need. [x2] 
 It were plain to see 
 Since the age of 3 
 One day dope fiends would be pagin' me 
 I got crunk in the game 
 Niggas knew my name 
 Hillwood, the place I gained my fame. 
 16, in the '77 Seville 
 Smoke gray, gold trim, Big Daddy grill 
 Back in '86, I was choppin' bricks 
 To think a damn Papermate got me rich 
 I got love for the hustlaz in every hood 
 Wit hate in your heart it'll never be good 
 I feel blessed but confess 
 I blow cess for my stress 
 It's that Mex with an S on my chest. 
 Nonetheless, I wish well for the homies 
 With the OZ's runnin' from the police 
 No peace, blow sweets on cold streets 
 Dope fiends go bring a nigga mo' green. 
 Now come follow me

 My money triples, sippin' Ripple 
 Livin' simple. Rollin' paper squares 
 Out a fat ass nickel 
 Tricks on my dick for the bricks I chop 
 Pigs in my mix when they hit my block 
 Used to catch a raid 'bout every 6 months 
 Just to check up to see if I'd slip once 
 Call it one time some rhyme 'bout this shit 
 I can slide in my sandals 
 But never will I slip. 
 Undercovers hit the set, Man y'all funny 
 Takin' them crumbs and givin' marked money 
 Tryin' to convict 'em, I ain't fallin' victim 
 Fool I know your face and my boys I done hipped 'em 
 They want me bad so mad as they burned off 
 Fuckin' with them hoes, now my blunt done turned off 
 No other way, just another day on the spot 
 If you play then you pay, It don't ever stop. 
 Now come follow me 
 Down Yellow Brick Road 
 To Wizard of Oz 
 Hillwood Hustla 
 Got what you need. [x2] 
 I wrote this book 'bout the hopeless crook 
 Livin' in the land where the coke is cooked 
 Where hoes get took and the joke is good 
 Where smokers hooked in a soldier's hood 
 That Lonely Wood, where his homies stood 
 Tryin' to change myself if I only could 
 I'm just your Hillwood Hustla 
 Street rhyme rustler 
 Blowin' mo' smoke than a broke down muffler. 
 But I'm takin' losses 
 It ain't easy workin' jobs with no fuckin' bosses 
 Sellin' dope is the hardest thing a man can do. 
 Risk your life and your freedom for a buck or 2. 
 Still I feel if you lose control, homey yousa hoe 
 Real G's keep they life on cruise control 
 When the police kick door and raid my crib 
 I tell 'em Pigs are for slippers. That's not what I did. 
 Now come follow me

 To Wizard of Oz
