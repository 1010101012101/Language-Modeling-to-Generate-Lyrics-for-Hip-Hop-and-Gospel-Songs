I'm meetin up with the governor 
 3-2 and the Hillwood Hustla 
 Comin' straight out the head though 
 From the brain representin my ghetto 
 It's a trip how they die young 
 In the hood in my Cadillac flyer, through the 'Wood 
 Wit my homie Iatola in the Clover 
 Pink soda mind of a noter 
 Lean on my shoulder slang coca 
 20 g'z on my team Villanova 
 Blow marijuana in the sauna 
 While my niggas move dope on the corner 
 V-12 motor vida loca 
 Now your bitch trying to give me her panocha 
 Fat sweet roller in my trocka 
 And my girl called the cops 'cause I choked her 
 Copa Cabana thankin' Santa 
 For the keyboard that came wit the sampler 
 Turn up the Clarion wit the stelly on 
 She wit me 'cause I am the champion 
 It's the same ol story though 
 Nigga died 'cause he fucked wit the wrong hoe 
 It's the sign of the times man 
 By second thank God that I'm alive man 
 Peace to my dead g's 
 Fell short trying to stack up they benjis 
 In the midst and the fog 
 Boys want to squab 
 All on my dick like corn on the cob 
 You ain't shit but a job for one of my killers 
 How many niggas must die by the trigga 
 I'm a sipper ima swerver first degree murder 
 Smoke a fried stick and get wetter than a surfer 
 No reversing my nature 90 pounds on my pager 
 I don't love you I don't hate you but I will misplace you 
 In the gutter for the fuck of it 
 Gangsta nigga chuggin shit candy on my mothership 
 And haters they can suck a dick 
 So this what it came to y'all the same crew 
 Old friends Southeast niggas claim blue 
 But I don't gangbang I claim no color 
 She lost her son what if that was your mother 
 I sit back in my '92 blue 'Lac 
 And I support foundations like LULAC 
 I went to Alma in second ward offa Sherman 
 That was back when niggas jammin to Pee Wee Herman 
 Smokin' with my teacher but not the preacher 
 I remember fuckin' Liz on the bleachers 
 1986 wasn't making hits 
 I was chasing chicks having bad relationships 
 Now I fuck Asian bitches fine Haitian bitches 
 Romanian Italian some fucking bang delicious 
 I went from pain to rich and I remain malicious 
 Shoot 'em up and leave 'em laying in some strange positions
