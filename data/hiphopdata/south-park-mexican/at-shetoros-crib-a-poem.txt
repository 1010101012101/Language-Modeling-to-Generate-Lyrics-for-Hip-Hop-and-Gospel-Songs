South Park Mexican: 
 Hey Shetoro, uhm play me that little latin beat 
 I wanna read this letter I wrote to my fans 
 In case I get killed or somethin' 
 I mean [laugh] I hope it never happens but 
 Damn there's just so many haters you never know. All right. 
 As I read this letter and as you listen 
 I know right now I'm either dead or in prison 
 I'm writin' these words as my daughter sleeps 
 I pray this is somethin' I'll never have to read 
 The year is 2007 & I've signed with Universal 
 All the hate can't stop me but it still hurts though 
 The smoke in my blunt can only hide my pain 
 My security is outside but I still sleep in the rain 
 They say that my lyrics destroy and kill 
 But I'm only tryin' to tell them that I know how they feel 
 I never had both of my parents 
 I was 3 when he left and ended the marriage 
 Most things I rap about, I no longer do 
 Tomorrow is church and after that is the zoo 
 Diamonds and cars don't make a man happy 
 Your jewels in life are your friends and family 
 The more money I make, the more problems appear 
 I feel my enemies are closin' in gettin' near 
 Inspired by jealousy they wish me the worst 
 I shook the hands of men that want me stiff in a hearse 
 But everything I do, is so that one day 
 Our kids can see their own kind in a positive way 
 Although I'm no angel in God I do trust 
 I'd like to take a second to tell you about us 
 Rasheed is from Philadelphia, Low-G is from Honduras 
 I was raised with my guela in a place called Falfurrias 
 But we're all the same race and that race is player 
 I've held 2 jobs ditch digger and brick layer 
 Now I see a sign as I lay in the chalk 
 Heaven's 7 million miles, Lord don't make me walk.
