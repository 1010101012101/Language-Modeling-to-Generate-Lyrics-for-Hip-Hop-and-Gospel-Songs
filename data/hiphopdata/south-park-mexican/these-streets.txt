South Park Mexican: 
 Sunshine in the wind with the bald fade 
 Gotta keep my dream down 'cause them laws hate 
 Out the roof deuce chunkin' 45 dunkin' 
 H-Town is just like Compton kick doors 
 Telescope hit folds make you boys sound softer than wet dough 
 Stack dollars went to crack college I like my salad with extra black olives 
 Acknowledge keep my lac polished 
 Don't mistake me for a fuckin' rap artist 
 I'm the one that shot slugs in your hot tub 
 Leave your bitch ass screwed and chopped up 
 None left known for car theft 
 But in the kitchen I'm the one top chef I cool whip it 
 I ain't bull shitin' turn 25oz to a new chicken. 
 Smoke bud 'cause it's my therapy 
 Take a .44 slug, turn that bitch to a memory 
 Can't show no love 
 'Cause these hoes greed jealousy 
 So run them thugs 
 These Streets keep callin' me. 
 Rasheed: 
 Let the bombs fly nigga we can all die 
 But wait a second first I gotta tell my mom bye 
 Maybe we can talk it out up in god's sky 
 Rasheed got more nuts than pecan pie. 
 I'm the wrong guy homey I don't fuck around 
 I've been a gangsta since way before Hustle Town 
 SP Low G ain't no hoe in' us 
 I don't eat alot of sweets but I smoke a bunch 
 You can go to lunch and nigga you can go to hell 
 Fuck the radio this shit is still gonna sell 
 Like I told my bitch if I'm ever killed, you'll never find another muthafucker more real 
 But say Los maybe we can get some airplay and talk about some of that bullshit that they say. 
 All the ladies in the house say " 
 oh 
 " 
 Damn I forgot I'm in this bitch all alone. 
 Smoke bud 'cause it's my therapy 
 Take a .44 slug, turn that bitch to a memory 
 Can't show no love 
 'Cause these hoes greed jealousy 
 So run them thugs 
 These Streets keep callin' me. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Los is a crawler, House-ton got taller 
 Up in H-Town move slow like koala 
 20's on the prowler starin' at the mirror 
 17 coats to make the paint clearer. 
 Up in my ride got more nuts than my pride 
 Keep a few hoes that I fuck on the side. 
 Paper chase me crib on the laker, ride through the trey, sfree wheel skater. 
 Breaker 1-9 shin' in the sunshine my Nextel phone sound like the love line 
 All day service got Jane burnin' my weed is lime green like frog named Kermit 
 Bustin' fuck the reprocaution 
 Blast him right before the radio lunch in, bloody murder 
 Not much of a converser 
 'Cause I say more bad words than a computer cursor. 
 Smoke bud 'cause it's my therapy 
 Take a .44 slug, turn that bitch to a memory 
 Can't show no love 
 'Cause these hoes greed jealousy 
 So run them thugs 
 These Streets keep callin' me.
