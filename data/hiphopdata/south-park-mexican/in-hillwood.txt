 South Park Mexican: 
 You see I smash on you pussy's & creep wit the thugs 
 I got a T-Shirt that say ???? ?? ??? ????? 
 I got a tight spot that sits by the sea 
 3 story beach house let's throw a party 
 Fucked-up in the head, I don't know what happened 
 I have nightmares & I wake up laughin' 
 With the bottle of tequila, tryin' to reach the bottom. 
 And why do all my aspirins have an "X" on 'em? 
 Got 2 rusty gats 
 2 house cats 
 And I don't feed 'em shit so they live off the rats 
 And Still didn't even pay my warrants 
 I just sat up in hell and ate my poriche. 
 In Hillwood. Where they ain't afraid to shoot. 
 In Hillwood. Where the fiends play the flute. 
 In Hillwood. Where they can't see the light. 
 In Hillwood. Where they don't sleep at night. 
 BASH: 
 Hit the-hit the dope house 'cause I had to recop it 
 I need some Purity so I screwed it and chopped it 
 Haters can't block it, fuck a judge hard 
 Mexican's gettin' big so they start gettin' jealous 
 Overzealous when we dip through the spot 'n' to the club 
 Cock blockers gettin' slapped with a muthafuckin' snub 
 You a thug, you a killer, you a gangsta, you a G 
 But I bet you with these hands man, you can't fuck with me 
 You just a silly trick mark mayne, talkin' all that masa 
 You love the smell of shit, yeah, you love the smell of caca 
 While we love the smell of roses and we drivin' somethin' vicious 
 Yeah we comin' down droppin' all you punk bitches. 
 In Hillwood. Where they ain't afraid to shoot. 
 In Hillwood. Where the fiends play the flute. 
 In Hillwood. Where they can't see the light. 
 In Hillwood. Where they don't sleep at night. 
 ICE: 
 Dicen que nos quieren matar pero ni se puedden acercar 
 Esta rola es una bomba que acaba de estallar 
 So fijate bien y mira quien es, no somos dos somos los tres 
 Los que fumamos mota para relisar estres 
 El mojado y el sur del park con el Bash listo para tumbarte 
 Listos para un desaster y por eso no quieren acercarse 
 So pescamos todos armados y el carro con rimes cromados 
 Escucha todo lo que yo te escribo por eso mi estilo es bien frio 
 Representando los illegales y todos que crusaron el rio 
 Gritando sigan me los malos rodiando de mil caiga palos 
 Brincado en cada vecendario gritando libreren a Carlos. 
 In Hillwood. Where they ain't afraid to shoot. 
 In Hillwood. Where the fiends play the flute. 
 In Hillwood. Where they can't see the light. 
 In Hillwood. Where they don't sleep at night. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 I solemly swear to tell the truth and nothin' but 
 My niggas dead all because a fuckin' slut 
 I never love a hoe, that one fo' sho' 
 Fuck home 'cause I roam just like a buffalo 
 I'm the baby of the family, runt of the litter 
 I can't stop smokin' 'cause no one likes a quitter 
 Every 3 months my house would get raided. 
 This muthaFuckin' album is the fuckin' shit? Ain't it? 
 Hydroponic leaves, rollin' up my sleeves 
 Throw your guns up in the sky for me 
 Hollin' peace to my boys on the Hillwood strand 
 Tryin' to make some cash, mama please understand. 
 In Hillwood. Where they ain't afraid to shoot. 
 In Hillwood. Where the fiends play the flute. 
 In Hillwood. Where they can't see the light. 
 In Hillwood. Where they don't sleep at night. [x2]
