[Girl:] Hey Carlos you got a letter today. 
 [Carlos:] What is this? Some more warrants or some shit? 
 [Girl:] I don't know. It looks like another letter from one of your buddies in the penitentiary. 
 [Carlos:] Oh yeah this my boy. Let's see what's poppin' on the other side of that fence. 
 Say homey 
 Pass that scooby dooby please don't be a hog 
 Let's roll all the windows up and get lost in the fog 
 Poppin' cells feels swell burn my finger nails 
 Its Christmastime so I'm bangin' screwed up Jingle Bells 
 Happy trails cookin' quails strangers in the night 
 Voodoo spells look who sells slangin' on my bike 
 My master bedroom comes alive I see 'em in the walls 
 My house was built with more yellow bricks than the fuckin' Wizard-of-Oz 
 People say that it's the easiest money a man can make 
 But you try facin' death everyday or the freedom that the cops can take. 
 Beautiful kids makin' honor roll 
 10 years later they on parole 
 Habitual Criminal 
 Back in the pen 'cause that's all they know 
 As he reads what's in the note 
 His freedom only comes in an envelope 
 An envelope, an envelope 
 His freedom only comes in an envelope. 
 To my niggas flippin' bricks watch out for the law 
 I slang everything but all I do is weed and alcohol 
 I keep a gat in every place that you could ever think 
 I dream of people kickin' down my door that's why I never blink 
 I'm from Hillwood and you can ask anyone who knows me well 
 I sleep with 1 eye open & I'm paranoid as hell 
 I've seen good friends come and go victim's of the game 
 Some dead some didn't have the time to flush it down the drain 
 My life is so remarkable it's a miracle that I'm here 
 I just spent 15 thousand bucks on a brand new chandaleir.

 An envelope, an envelope

 Bang bang bang, boom boom boom 
 23 hoes in your homies bedroom 
 Nah nah nah nah, oh la la 
 Told you not to mess wit dada 
 Now as you skip to my lou 
 Your gonna make me fuck you off on the cool 
 Mad at the world 'cause your money won't stack 
 Can't rap homey don't nobody want that 
 Eenie meenie miney mo 
 Grab a hoe by the throat 
 I'm a have to wash your mouth out with soap 
 I'm a soldier, strike like a cobra 
 Muthafuckin' Libra, born in October 
 Somebody should've told ya 
 I fuck with killers 
 Peace to my neighbors chillin' up in garden villers 
 I'm a damn fool, I'm a muthafuckin' trip. 
 While you niggas keep bumpin' your dick suckin' lips. 
 Now have you ever seen a man wearin' pantyhose? 
 Then watch me as I put 'em over my face and go kill me some hoes.
