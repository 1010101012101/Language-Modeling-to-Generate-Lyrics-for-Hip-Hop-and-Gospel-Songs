Yeah this is a song I wrote for my wife before she was my wife 
 We've been together 18 years now that's like half my life 
 & she's still by my side 
 I love you baby. 
 Your love is beautiful it's undisputable 
 You got me rappin' 'bout it up inside this studio 
 Like crazy man cause how I feel ain't normal. 
 & I'm writin' in my journal I hope it's eternal 
 I'm your favorite fan when you make an appearance 
 The smile on your face lift's up my spirits 
 I want to trust you & know that you'll be mine forever 
 You want a lifetime of love that's what I'm a deliver 
 But I worry a little & I'm not sure why 
 But the thought of ever losin' you blows my mind 
 & I know that I really shouldn't think that way 
 I guess what I'm tryin' to say today is baby. 
 Is it real? 
 Tell me Are We Real? 
 Or Are you just sayin' things that I wanna hear? 
 Are you really true? 
 Baby is it destiny? 
 Are you the one that God made & he meant for me? 
 Is it real? 
 Tell me Are We Real? 
 Or Are you just sayin' things that I wanna hear? 
 Are you really true? 
 Baby is it destiny? 
 Are you the one that God made & he meant for me? 
 I don't mean to sound scared or even insecure 
 Usually I don't trip over chicks but your somethin' else 
 Somethin' pure, an amazin' brew 
 Mama raised a G but didn't raise a fool 
 So I don't wanna lose you like I lost so many 
 Not really carin' 'bout our future & it cost me dearly 
 So many years as a player in a negative sense 
 & I guess it took this whole big set of events 
 To let me see things differently, I've grown as a man 
 & just wanna walk through life while holdin' your hand 
 Kiss you in the moonlight & touch your face 
 & let you know that your the one that no one can replace'. 
 Is it real? 
 Tell me Are We Real? 
 Or Are you just sayin' things that I wanna hear? 
 Are you really true? 
 Baby is it destiny? 
 Are you the one that God made & he meant for me? 
 Is it real? 
 Tell me Are We Real? 
 Or Are you just sayin' things that I wanna hear? 
 Are you really true? 
 Baby is it destiny? 
 Are you the one that God made & he meant for me? 
 I broke many hearts in the days of past 
 & they told me one day one will break yours back 
 & avenge all the girls that you left in tears 
 But my heart was too hard to ingest those fears 
 So I ran through a bunch some snack some lunch 
 Some was dark some was yellow like captain crunch 
 & we laughed a bunch & we balled at malls 
 & If I could I would apologize to all of y'all 
 Saw the pain in her eyes as she begged me to stay 
 & now I truly understand how she felt that day 
 Cause now I feel the same & I want it to work 
 Hopin' I don't end up like the ones that I've hurt. 
 Is it real? 
 Tell me Are We Real? 
 Or Are you just sayin' things that I wanna hear? 
 Are you really true? 
 Baby is it destiny? 
 Are you the one that God made & he meant for me? 
 Is it real? 
 Tell me Are We Real? 
 Or Are you just sayin' things that I wanna hear? 
 Are you really true? 
 Baby is it destiny? 
 Are you the one that God made & he meant for me?
