Feat. Baby Bash, Kumbia Kings, Low-G 
 Intro [Kumbia Kings]: 
 Oh, Feria 
 Oh, oh, oh, My Feria. 
 Chorus: Kumbia Kings 
 I'm in love with My Feria 
 What I would for My Feria 
 I stay true to My Feria 
 Because My Feria loves me. [x2] 
 1st Verse [South Park Mexican]: 
 I got a bad girl, With a big ol' face 
 And "In God we trust" tattooed around her waist 
 Helped me beat a dope case 
 And she paid off the judge 
 I bet her on the Cubs and the Phoenix Suns 
 Her name is Cashola way over Maria 
 She bought me a casino in South Korea 
 How we roll, You have no oh idea 
 She run with hoes like Christina "La Bolia" 
 She never bounce like a check 
 Put a ounce in my vet 
 Got a house & a jet 
 She my spouse and my friend 
 Put my cousin through college and bought my grandma a lil' ranch 
 She crazy 
 Always chase me tryin' to get in my pants. [laughs] 
 Chorus: Kumbia Kings 
 I'm in love with My Feria 
 What I would for My Feria 
 I stay true to My Feria 
 Because My Feria loves me. [x2] 
 2nd Verse [South Park Mexican:] 
 She come from a tree but she ain't Mary Jane 
 I'm talkin' 'about my paper, Man! 
 Never fake or counterfeit, My Madam Loiselle 
 Bought me snacks up in jail 
 Until they granted me bail 
 My jewels 
 Surround my platinum gazelles 
 She can't spell but she can sure count well 
 Record sales make her swell 
 Bought my 1st 2 12's 
 My first sound system bang and rock the bells 
 Lock and load, Clock and fold 
 Pocket swoll' 
 Rock 'n' roll out the door 
 For pots of gold 
 Congratulator shoot haters like Space Invaders 
 So much Feria I bought a swimmin' pool for my neighbors. 
 Chorus: Kumbia Kings 
 I'm in love with My Feria 
 What I would for My Feria 
 I stay true to My Feria 
 Because My Feria loves me. [x2] 
 3rd Verse [Baby Bash]: 
 Now we gon' ride like the wind 
 My lover, my dividend 
 She my feri I'm her daddy and she my best friend 
 Got me spendin' weekends in Kingston Jamaica 
 Oh my fettucini, Oh I love my paper 
 When she get outta line 
 Papi gon' get on her grind 
 Facin' penitentiary time 
 But she's eventually mine 
 Same color as my hydro 
 I swear to God the only bitch I'll ever die for 
 Or rob for. 
 4th Verse [Low-G]: 
 I go to war for my peso 
 My queso 
 My villete's, Que bella 
 Te miras como una estrella 
 Da' playa' 
 El Jugador 
 El fumador 
 Todo mundo sabe lo que haria por tu amor 
 Oye chico. 
 You got my federico? 
 Pobrecito 
 Now I gotta call my primo 
 El Cochino 
 Suck the blood like Dracula 
 I'm in the hood flippin' cookies with my spatula. 
 Chorus: Kumbia Kings 
 I'm in love with My Feria 
 What I would for My Feria 
 I stay true to My Feria 
 Because My Feria loves me. [x2]
