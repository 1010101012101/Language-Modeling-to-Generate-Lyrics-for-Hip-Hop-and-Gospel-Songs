JC: 
 We had met through a friend and then 
 Thought we'd be together till the very end 
 My partners told me you was 'about that dough 
 But when they said it I was like "Hell no" 
 'Cause I knew that you was so special 
 Started seein' signs but I wouldn't let go 
 You complainin' 'about my money cash flow 
 Said it was a what, a bit too low 
 You was trippin' on my boy's Tahoe 
 And told me why can't you be like that ballin' nigga Ro. 
 (Chorus: JC) 
 I loved you, I couldn't live without you 
 My life was all about you and that just wasn't Cool Enough 
 And now I'm back though and rollin' in my Benzo 
 On 22 Lorenzo and now you want to call me up. 
 JC: 
 Do you recall a trip to NYC? 
 I spent all the money that I made that week 
 38 hours on my 9 to 5 
 No matter how I tried your ass was never satisfied 
 Go back in town & I'm drivin' us home 
 Stop at the light and you jockin' someone's clothes 
 I knew right then it wouldn't be me 
 Relationship was history 
 I just can't bring my back for no it watchin' H O E. 
 (Chorus: JC) 
 I loved you, I couldn't live without you 
 My life was all about you and that just wasn't Cool Enough 
 And now I'm back though and rollin' in my Benzo 
 On 22 Lorenzo and now you want to call me up. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 High priced hoochie, love that coochie 
 But I won't sit back and let a broad use me 
 Too much cash in my jeans left pocket 
 In the VIP blowin' kill with the Rockets 
 Baller shot caller, sippin' alcohola 
 Dope House after party, everybody follow 
 Don't trip, I got it real sick nowadays 
 6 police that be earnin' they pay 
 Breakin' up fights and shinin' they lights 
 Take 'em all to jail till they learn to be nice 
 Jose and my boy Mario 
 Brought a truck full of bud, we gon' party yo. 
 (Chorus: JC) 
 I loved you, I couldn't live without you 
 My life was all about you and that just wasn't Cool Enough 
 And now I'm back though and rollin' in my Benzo 
 On 22 Lorenzo and now you want to call me up.
