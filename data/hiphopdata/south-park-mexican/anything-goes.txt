South Park Mexican: 
 South Park from the heart jump start 
 The game everybody in my hood sellin' 
 Crack cocaine. 
 On my block Anything Goes [echoes] 
 Diamond rings on my pinky toes [echoes] 
 Candy paint on my Cadillac [echoes] 
 Who the fuck wanna battle rap? [echoes] 
 Believe me you don't have a chance [echoes] 
 I come down like an avalanche [echoes] 
 South Park Mexican:] [Verse 1: 
 Load the pieces widreeses watch out lo que me dices 
 I'm on the mic and Jaime's on the Alecis Dicky Crieses 
 Fucked all your nieces I eaten up for breakfast 
 They taste so delicious smoke fill rooms poppin' mushrooms 
 I feel like I'm inna muthafuckin' cartoon sippin' on Red Rum 
 You should join us a million haters and they still can't destroy us 
 On the mic I'm known to get it started. 
 Cold hearted and half ass retarded 
 Dearly departed and those who god guarded 
 The young and the lost is who I'm tryin' to target 
 The Sargeant's narcotic's division is crocked 
 They found my bloody money and the muthafucker's took it 
 Whip this nigga and book this nigga 
 And they wonder why I such a Ruthless nigga 
 You can act like you don't hear me 
 I know your listenin' 
 I hear you talkin' out the pot that your pissin' in 
 Street specialist respect my intelligence 
 I got gats that's made to drop elephants.

 (South Park Mexican:] [Verse 2) 
 20 ounce Mountain Dew mix it with a 2 
 With my nephew smokin' Pepe Le Pew 
 Talkin' about a dude we don't think is groovy 
 I'm a put him to bed like Sleepin' Beauty 
 I told you once & I'm a tell you twice 
 But I'm not gonna say this 3 or 4 times 
 You boys wanna play we don't Runaway 
 God damn I forgot what I was gonna say 
 Somethin' about 45's & Mac 11's 
 Desert Eagles & A K 47's 
 Slice your throat just like a goat 
 You boys can't see me with a microscope 
 Kick down your door and found your Snow 
 Smokin' tough cause you hada fuckin' pound of Dro 
 And After I jack all the birds in your kitchen 
 I hit the ass naked-n-go feed the pigeons.

 (South Park Mexican:] [Verse 3) 
 Crack hotels digital scales 
 Platinum neckles laced on Rockells 
 Shine my jewels buff my toe nails 
 Who kisses and tells bees who sees hell 
 Smoke like a rasta watch the imposter. 
 Who's at my door? Another cookie monster 
 Hasta la vista bon a patista 
 12 gauge shoty make your chest look like pizza 
 Call me Flintstone; Land of Bedrock 
 I bought 2 clubs in a fuckin' restaurant 
 Take a journey where the boys die too early 
 45 underneath a niggas rockets jersey 
 Turn the table buck shots be fatal 
 Pigs hand cuffin' my wrist to my ankle 
 Mira muchacha's it's all about the Raza 
 Burn my fingers tryin' to smoke a cucaracha 
 They prejudice that's why they don't play mexicans 
 I get my dick sucked by my new receptionist 
 I started out with 100 tapes 
 If you wasn't down then get the fuck out my face.
