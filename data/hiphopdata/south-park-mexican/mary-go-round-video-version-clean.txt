(South Park Mexican:) 
 Yo-yo homeboy, pass me that. 
 Yo, this is a song I wrote for the girl I love. 
 Her name ... Mary Jane. 
 (South Park Mexican:) 
 Saggin' my dicky's, smoke like a hippy 
 Smell's so good when she get wet and sticky 
 You lift me, girl you the bomb 
 Got a ***** blowin' like Cheech and Chong 
 A bong, a blunt or a paper square 
 It really don't matter she'll take you there 
 You been my girl since the age of 13 
 And it's funny to me, you still make me fiend 
 You put a spell on me with the green voodoo 
 You love when my boys come and run us a choo choo 
 Mary Jane deep in the game 
 The way I feel words can't explain 
 You been true to me, stood by my side 
 I wake up and get my mornin's first high 
 Other h*** wonder why they get no love 
 'Cause Mary got a big ol' bud, huh. 
 Mary-Go-Round, round and round 
 Oh let the Mary-Go-Round, pass the sweet. (x2) 
 (Rasheed:) 
 If you's a Jane user 
 Throw your hands in the air with this ********ckin' 3 time user 
 Producer wanna cool my future (pass the sweet) 
 Pass the madusa, I never lose her. 
 Who you, who do you think you are? 
 Your f***** with a Dope House shootin' star. 
 (Low-G:) 
 Smokin' that budda 
 Drinkin' that puda 
 Booya, another killer from Honduras 
 I thug in rider chick get's me higher 
 There's no need tryin' to find a finer hyner 
 I decire my bitch on fire 
 People stare as we kiss on the player. 
 Mary-Go-Round, round and round 
 Oh let the Mary-Go-Round, pass the sweet. (x2) 
 (South Park Mexican:) 
 Now you can do snow or get wet as the rain 
 Me, man I got Jane in my brain 
 Of course I kick doors for white whore's 
 But my wife Mary Jane I never get divorced 
 'Cause she be the only one fit for a player 
 The green eyes and the pretty red hair 
 *** **** Sick 'cause them jealous ***ches wanna 
 Vyla como Juana, Maria-Juana 
 You was born in Mexico but I took the chance 
 And brought your *** across to the promise lands 
 I love to lay you down so soft in my swisher 
 Act like a freak and let all my ****** hit you 
 I got your picture on all my walls 
 Mama caught us kissin' wanna call the laws 
 My family thinks you nothin' but trouble 
 Can't see how you helped me through the struggle. 
 Mary-Go-Round, round and round 
 Oh let the Mary-Go-Round, pass the sweet. (x2)
