Here we go. 
 Say this is freestyle Flow from the Penitentiary 
 SP on lock from the greed and jealousy 
 I'm a pay back soon, mama don't cry 
 Stay strong no matter what, even If I Die 
 I hold it down and still got more trees than Christmas 
 I'm a try to freestyle for about 93 minutes 
 In the days As A Youngsta at the Quick Snap 
 It was me, Pity Pat and his younger brother Black 
 Tio, Crooked, Pluck, Carrie, Mushey 
 Lil' Anthony, Craig and my nigga Abrae 
 Berry stealin' cars and Raymond started smokin' 
 5 O's raided houses like they playin' for Oakland 
 Jump out boys tryin' to catch Mr. Coy 
 'Cause I got more bricks in the wall than Pink Floyd 
 We looked up to drug dealers, growin' up fast 
 I lost an ounce down the sink 'cause I use the wrong glass 
 Fuck pickle jars and mayonnaise too 
 I bought a pyrex at the you of H school 
 I acted like a student, they tried to make me prove it. 
 Mexican's in college. Son are you stupid? 
 Stupid is what stupid does, then they all just looked at us 
 Finally they sold them to me, I went home and cooked it up 
 Rockafella a cappella I could just go on forever 
 Make you sound softer than a muthafuckin' golfer sweater 
 Spray that bam on my leather 
 Like girls spray perfume on a letter 
 SPM hard as ever, come on y'all all together 
 Cali back to Harlingen, there's no need for arguin' 
 I'm the hardest on this mic, man they know what is happenin'. 
 Uh man.
