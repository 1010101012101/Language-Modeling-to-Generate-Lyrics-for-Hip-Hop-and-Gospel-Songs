-Que onda Frost, how you been homeboy?... 
 -Hey what's up dawg...? 
 -Check it out man, I want you to meet my #1 soldado Low-G... 
 -Hey, Low-G. Where you from Homes?... 
 Low G: 
 Mi querida, Centro America 
 Aqui en Houston ganando mi feria 
 En la esquina, La vida es fina 
 Le pido a Dios que me cuida mi nin'a 
 Mira, mi jale es la calle 
 Vendiendo libras que vienen del valle 
 Sin mi madre me entendiera 
 Mi familia va primera 
 Mi bandera era mi guerra 
 It's whatever, bustin' on cualquiera 
 Quiero que sepas que yo soy la muerte 
 Si te escapas, sera pura suerte. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Capish, understand the touch 
 Let a G show you how to turn a man to dust 
 L.A. to Nueva York es puro amor 
 For all who got love for El Jugador 
 Houstone to Nuevo Leon 
 3 Bandido's on the microphone 
 Strike wit chrome, True crime family 
 Enemies pay, never die happily. 
 Frost: 
 Assault Rifle's, Professional Sniper's 
 Got my rival's shitin' in they diapers 
 You don't like us, Cool, but don't show it. 
 Who wanna fuck with this killer slash poet? 
 I blow it up like NitroGlycerine 
 You bitches love talkin' out the pot you pissin' in 
 Chill homes 'cause you ain't that hard 
 Fraud, flossin' in your own backyard 
 I'm worldwide, in the 2-Tone lowride 
 Your girl hide in my seat when you pass by 
 That's my life HaterHeartBreaker 
 Life taker, Smile Now, Die Later. 
 Phone rings: 
 -Dope House Records. 
 -Man what's up Los? What's up with my bitch snow white? 
 -She's goin' for 13 5. 
 -Cool, let's start with 50 then...

 South Park Mexican: 
 I'm in the sport where we import what you snort 
 Leavin' court, goin' straight to the airport 
 I don't chase paper, paper chase me 
 Feds mad tryin' to decide how I break free 
 Take heed to the roughneck tactics 
 I got you putos screamin' worse than an actress 
 In a horror flick He all be flippin' brick 
 In this biz, you better be rollin' thick 
 Holdin' shit down, son ain't no seein' us 
 My Nina bust, another Human Bein' crushed 
 Street Genius, so so serious 
 Your fearin' this, deadly experience.
