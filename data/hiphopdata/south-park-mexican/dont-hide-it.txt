Grimm: 
 Automatics be kickin' reloaded streets done exploded 
 But hopeless, lost on the dro'ded armored soldier's 
 The fully loadest, book was strong as bullets recorded led oldies 
 Pour some mo' 'cause I got love for my dead homies 
 Playin' bogus, reminiscin' 'about the days 
 Gettin' blazed, stayin' paid, cook my yay in microwaves 
 I was raised, learnin' plays off the pages of gangsta ways 
 Sharp as swisher blades, hard to finish my race 
 In your face, place to place flippin' channels 
 Got the dope within' the panels, from the Valley to Ingrando 
 Nothin' we can't handle, mexicano's out of Texas 
 Runnin' with the best 'cause fuck with nothin' less 'cause... 
 Boy Don't you Hide It, roll it up and light it 
 It's how we do it in the Southeast 
 When you ride you gotta pack your piece 
 It's all the same up in the Northeast. 
 Boy Don't you Hide It, roll it up and light it 
 It's how we do it in the Northwest 
 Put to rest if you ain't wearin' your vest 
 It's all the same down in the Southwest. 
 Bing: 
 The feds on me, I reminisce about my dead homies 
 Now that I'm investin' tryin' to put some led on me 
 Cops on the licks, robbin' boys off since. 
 Who's next with the plex? We knockin' boys off the deck 
 I'm known to wreck I'm Bing, I ain't gon' drop my flag 
 I drop my sample up & I drop your ass 
 Pull out and smash, just a youngsta 'about his cash 
 I'm the first & I'm the last, I K E bring it bad. 
 Ikeman: 
 We southeast on lock, Grimm, Ike and Bing gon' hop 
 Southeast be Wreckshop, time go blast up the block 
 Murder murder with the glock nigga, we bust shots nigga 
 With dead dots nigga, the feds hot 
 We the realest and what not, be killers that won't stop 
 You niggas is gon' drop, fuckin' with the wrong block 
 Off the top, this one here is for my dead homies 
 I'm over here reminiscin' when you bled on me. 
 Boy Don't you Hide It, roll it up and light it 
 It's how we do it in the Southeast 
 When you ride you gotta pack your piece 
 It's all the same up in the Northeast. 
 Boy Don't you Hide It, roll it up and light it 
 It's how we do it in the Northwest 
 Put to rest if you ain't wearin' your vest

 Grimm: 
 The game's headed worst, ridin' your homey in the hears 
 Done prayin' for his soul, at the church still it hurts 
 To know that he's gone, thought he'd live long 
 Hard to stay strong, wanna know what went wrong 
 Still ain't nothin' you can do to bring your homey back 
 Steady puff, pour the boo remember rollin' lac's 
 Now there's more in the pack and the Pac and the Bigg's 
 Eazy E, this harder rapper ever lived 
 In the minds and hearts, of players, ballers and pimps 
 That don't refine the arts, of proper measurements 
 Settin' presidents, for all the hustlaz to come 
 That live and die by the gun, but still gon' ride till they time come. 
 Boy Don't you Hide It, roll it up and light it 
 It's how we do it in the Southeast 
 When you ride you gotta pack your piece 
 It's all the same up in the Northeast. 
 Boy Don't you Hide It, roll it up and light it 
 It's how we do it in the Northwest 
 Put to rest if you ain't wearin' your vest 
 It's all the same down in the Southwest.
