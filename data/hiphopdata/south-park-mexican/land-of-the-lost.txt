He was a son of a dope man 
 What he saw is what he learned 
 He left school, now it's finally his turn 
 To rob and steal, but he feels he needs to stop and chill 
 'Cause deep in his heart he knows that God is real 
 Mama still tries to open his eyes 
 'Cause the way a man lives is the way a man dies. 
 His father's doin' 25 to life 
 'Cause the love of money cuts like a knife 
 Blinding lights 
 He doesn't know which way to go 
 His best friend just got killed 2 days ago 
 He writes his Dad the first letter that he ever wrote 
 A little note about how bad his heart was broke 
 Before the mail could even reach his jail cell 
 The boy was murdered at a neighborhood hotel. 
 Sellin' wholesale just like his pops taught him 
 Rock bottom. 
 A muthafuckin' cop shot him. 
 Over chorus: 
 Always. 
 I won't forget. 
 Always, baby. 
 I love you. 
 It went so fast. 
 I still ask why. 
 I miss you. 
 We always will remember you 
 We always will have love for you 
 A taste of wine and now you're gone 
 You found the light in the Land of the Lost. 
 They met when they was teenagers 
 Around the 10th grade 
 She fell in love 
 And now he wants to get paid 
 He convinced her to work at the ass naked 
 And everything she made dancin' 
 He would take it 
 She got her fake I.D. & her club license 
 A second life, that she had to live in silence 
 At 17, she got the strength to finally leave him 
 That's when she met the demon. 
 It was a cold murder 
 He made sure that he really hurt her 
 Over dumb shit, but he had to take it further 
 Circumstances that led to last dances 
 She hit the canvas, now she at St. Frances 
 6:00 services, feel the nervousness 
 Of havin' to look at dead perfectness 
 I'm smokin' roaches burnin' the shit out my fingers 
 Rememberin' the words of the church choir singers. 
 Over chorus: 
 Always. 
 I won't forget. 
 Always, baby. 
 I love you. 
 It went so fast. 
 I still ask why. 
 I miss you. 
 We always will remember you 
 We always will have love for you 
 A taste of wine and now you're gone 
 You found the light in the Land of the Lost. 
 Another Mexican gangbanger, set tripper 
 Wig splitter, a trigger happy ditch digger 
 Itchy finger quick to blast upon a rival 
 Vida Loca, another word for suicidal 
 Same color of skin, but different colored rags 
 Browns puttin' Browns up in bodybags. 
 Every 2 or 3 streets, it's a different clique 
 They got no love for themselves, so they livin' sick. 
 For centuries we've been fillin' penitentiaries 
 It's plain to see, we're our worst enemies 
 The smartest, most talented of the Raza 
 Is all dead or doin' time for a fuckin' tranza 
 Geniuses all dyin' meaningless 
 'Cause they can't find a way to break free from this 
 Needless to say, the gangsta that I speak of 
 G Love, is layin' in the grave that he dug. 
 Twice: 
 Over chorus: 
 Always. 
 I won't forget. 
 Always, baby. 
 I love you. 
 It went so fast. 
 I still ask why. 
 I miss you. 
 We always will remember you 
 We always will have love for you 
 A taste of wine and now you're gone 
 You found the light in the Land of the Lost. 
 We always will remember you 
 We always will have love for you 
 A taste of wine and now you're gone 
 You found the light in the Land of the Lost.
