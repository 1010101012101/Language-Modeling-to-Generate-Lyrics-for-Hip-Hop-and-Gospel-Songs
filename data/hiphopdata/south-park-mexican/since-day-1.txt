South Park Mexican: 
 It's been alot of years I've been knowin' these boys 
 If I got a Benz I hope they drive a Rolls Royce 
 See the thing with us 
 Stayin' together is a must 
 Chunk like the deuce on my Jr. High bus 
 See we party since the break dance days 
 Now it's '99 still on the fast lane 
 Man I'm a dog if I was a cat I'd be in heaven 
 'Cause I past 9 lives back in '87 
 Deep in this rap but it's just like the streets 
 I see the same killers hustlers and freaks 
 I remember you sellin' white on the cut 
 Now you most hated on the mic hollerin' what 
 Choppin' up the scene 
 While we puffin' trees 
 1 family & 2 companies 
 SPM bring the movement let's do this baby 
 Skin tight homies since the early 80's. 
 We all around the world on the mission for meals 
 Keep it crunk it's for real 
 Blowin' on kill 
 Niggas already know 
 We gon' ride fo' sho' 
 SPM, Ikeman and that Grimm in the door 
 About Benjamins 
 So the quest begins. 
 Who wanna step to the 3 coldest Mexican's? 
 But don't play dumb when you see the spray gun 
 'Cause we been down together Since Day 1. 
 Ikeman: 
 Los I'm thinkin' nothin' but stacks 
 Unless it's flippin' in 'llacs 
 Big body Benz's & Jags 
 We count hundreds in cash 
 So ain't no stoppin' us now 
 We deep in love with this pay 
 And all these lavish ass things 
 Like 18 K cardia 
 We comin' creased with these J's 
 We stayin' tight with them spades 
 We high rollin' we paid 
 We got respect 'cause we made 
 I'm livin' deep in this game 
 And ain't no way I'm a change 
 These busters knowin' my name 
 But ain't no way they can hang 
 With a mexicano like Ike 
 Soy veterano for life 
 In Jam Down commission they got my name up in light's 
 I represent for them thugs 
 That ride the boats and push drugs 
 And smoke the best of them buds 
 And save the rest for the scrubs. 
 We all around the world on the mission for meals 
 Keep it crunk it's for real 
 Blowin' on kill 
 Niggas already know 
 We gon' ride fo' sho' 
 SPM, Ikeman and that Grimm in the door 
 About Benjamins 
 So the quest begins. 
 Who wanna step to the 3 coldest Mexican's? 
 But don't play dumb shen you see the spray gun 
 'Cause we been down together Since Day 1. 
 Grimm: 
 I burn the sesses 
 Ain't nothin' less 
 I gots the S on my chest 
 I been blessed by my best 
 You know the real get no rest 
 We comin' through 
 With Power Moves: 
 It ain't no rules in this game 
 The same as movin' the caine 
 We move the music with chains 
 And that's my chase for all my paper 
 Plates with chips on the table 
 Bet them all & I'm able 
 'Cause Jam Down is the label 
 It's on the hunt for millions or billions 
 Ready for more 
 We 'about to settle the score 
 We world wide and on tour 
 I call my boy South Park the Mexican and it's on 
 We reminisce gettin' blown 
 Been best of friends for so long 
 Back in the days 
 We made the paper every gram we weighed 
 But now it's slammed to stay 
 Paper jams and blaze. 
 We all around the world on the mission for meals 
 Keep it crunk it's for real 
 Blowin' on kill 
 Niggas already know 
 We gon' ride fo' sho' 
 SPM, Ikeman and that Grimm in the door 
 About Benjamins 
 So the quest begins.
