I was raised on beans and rice 
 And if you shot up my crib I wouldn't be surprised 
 Mama used to trip 'cause I fed the mice 
 I'm the one they sent home 'cause my head had lice 
 I'm the kid that lost my sanity 
 I'm the kid that had the toys with no batteries 
 Mama sat me down for some serious talks 
 On how to keep the rats out the cereal box 
 I feel you homie, nigga, I lived that shit, nigga, I felt that shit 
 We never felt so rich those were the good ass days, bro 
 Sure we was broke but we was B-B guns 
 Havin' hella fun on natural dough 
 When you started to smoke that's when you changed 
 The weed hit the brain and the man thought he came 
 It was joint, after joint, after joint, after joint 
 In one month your fuckin' brain was destroyed 
 Now you got children and a beautiful wife 
 The kinda money that you make nigga you set for life 
 Enjoy your self man you only live once 
 Take your family vacation and relax for a month 
 I'ma smoke 'til I croak nigga fuck bein' broke nigga 
 I need seven bedrooms and my boat nigga 
 Watchin' rats with eighty seven new gats 
 The penitentiary's the only place when I can relax 
 I want some hoes in they heads they pushin' me to the edge 
 The only thing I'ma miss is my beautiful kids 
 I'm just sippin' but thrown I handle shit on my own 
 I got a camera for every fuckin' inch of my home 
 It's in my blood to be a drunk and not give a fuck 
 I do a drive-by in my grandmas truck 
 A G daddy left me at the age of three 
 Now every South Side crack-head pagin' me 
 Chill homie cut dad some slack 
 Sure he left our ass but that was way the fuck back 
 You all cot up hearin' blastin' on dub 
 We was only seven when our house got shot up 
 Mom was all bloody I saw that shit 
 It was just blast from the mirror it's alright kid 
 You blessed by God man you can't give up 
 And run around town not givin' a fuck 
 Yeah of course they jealous and pullin' hoes shit 
 It's hard to be that mess-kin that came up so quick 
 You made it look easy but It's just an illusion 
 You did the impossible and took over Houston 
 Now everybody thinks they can do like you 
 Losin' thousands and thousands on a half ass crew 
 Talkin' down on you but you got nothing to prove 
 Let 'em run they mouth all the fuck they want to 
 Muthafuck you nigga stop preachin' and shit 
 I grab my muthafuckin' glock and start squeezin' my shit 
 No mercy for the weak bitch so save yo' speech bitch 
 You can't reach I'm too deep in these streets bitch 
 Don't piss me off I'll put this gat to yo' head 
 Can't you see these jealous bitches pray for us to be dead 
 You gettin' soft now? You must wanna die too 
 All it takes is one bullet to kill me and you 
 Damn dawg, you hear that gun shot? 
 Soundin' like it came from SPM's room 
 Let's go check it out 
 All my people fight the evil 
 Some sniff paint and some shoot needle 
 Some take shots with salt and lemon 
 Get fucked up and beat they women 
 All the children need someone 
 To show them they can't be someone 
 Mad at me 'cause I came up 
 I don't understand what y'all want 
 Say, Los, check this out, man 
 What up, SPM? 
 Say, let's just smoke and joint, man 
 And try to work this thing out 
 Well, we could smoke a joint 
 I dunno about all that other shit 
 Ha ha
