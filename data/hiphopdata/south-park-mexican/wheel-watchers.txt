 Verse 1:SPM: 
 Wheel watchers pullin boppers from a mile away, 
 Contemplation, hesitation, baby have a nice day 
 I been grindin these streets dodgen feds and cops 
 I roll on choppers on day, but 23's by dark 
 Bubbles lit, legs split when they see my shit 
 Screens rain out tha sky all my tags legit 
 See my flossin and I'm tossin wide body fa sho 
 Lane to lane grippin grain AC blowin' like snow 
 Now keep winnin' playas spinnin when I chop in the wind 
 My lil body and big body and my Double O benz 
 When burn off on (?) represent tha dam hill 
 Land of tha real pull ya feel pop up bumpa and grilles 
 I switch to tyte, now I'm in the bentley 
 Wood deck with leather seats and some 123. 
 Ain't shit changed in this game hoes still approachin 
 Steady lookin' at our cars 'cause the wheels of Fortune. 
 I'm, I'm a wheel watcher

 Verse 2: SPM 
 I went from no shows to car shows, from change to dolla's 
 Put the ruger in the couger and bought the impala 
 Choppers spinnin girls grinnin at the lights on the benz 
 Off the lot, on dot, we some million dollar men 
 Land cruizer, range rovers for special occasions 
 7 digits just for wigits in every situation 
 I can go underwater when I'm in a submarine 
 But jump back on tha land, 10 door limozine 
 Fettucine caviar, lamborginis and jaguars 
 From food to cars whe shine bright like the stars 
 I'm heard in 3 different languages and several voices 
 Luxury benz with tha screens south leather rolls royce 
 I can keep it for the winter 'cause its time for tha summer 
 Tire Tracks are yokohama and tailgates say HUMMER 
 VISUALIZE AND analyze they bops and they watch 
 To keep this the definition of the wheel watchers
