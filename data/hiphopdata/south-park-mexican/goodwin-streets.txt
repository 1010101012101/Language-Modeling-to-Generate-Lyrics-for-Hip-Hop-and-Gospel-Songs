"Yo is dat nano puttin' it down! " 
 (Nano) 
 Blaze sweets come from da streets 
 Be leaving haterz in their kneez 
 Kick it wit real G's down for da clicka of da palmview p's 
 Y'all heard what I said y'all know what it is 
 Don't be hatin' on my rhyme 'cause you be in my list 
 Iam in diz mackin cheese sting like a bee fly like a bird 
 Hittin curb in black t-bird smokin' herb put you in da dirt 
 Inhale smoke and turn blue like smurf my boys be hangin' inda goodwin 
 Curb 
 "Goodwin, goodwin be riddin in gangsta buick, be flowin like fluid" 
 Yo I come one more time be bustin' clips of my nine 
 Feelin' fine got a rhyme got to get high smoke weed all night 
 Cry for my homies dat have died y'all rest in peace 
 And be on yo way to a better life 
 If I ain't got a gat I have a knife 
 Keep a eye on every carro rollin' by 
 It's a bitch stayin strap todo el dia 
 Even my tia gots a cuete when she makes tortillas 
 But yo know I got stay alive phools be rollin' 
 In my calle wit no lights and you know why 
 There's about to be a drive by 
 (Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop) 
 Dam nigga run and hide got to show no shiest 
 'Cause wit dis vatos in my hood you gonna die 
 So you better throw da right set 
 If you don't wanna hole in yo head 
 Fuck red, fuck dat shit 
 A real mex wit his tek bitch show respect 
 I won't regret of leaving you dead 
 Then I'll take yo hoe to da bed 
 I am down wit da goodwin shit! 
 (Ha, ha, hope ya lil vatos heard, is no playing 
 In my hood, real niggas puttin' cuetes to yo head 
 Everyday you got to be strap, just keep it real. 
 And fo all you haters, fuck you bitches, yous a hoe!"
