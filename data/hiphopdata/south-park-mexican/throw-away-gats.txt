South Park Mexican: 
 Personly, I feel my people is cursed to be 
 Riders till eternity 
 My enemies tryin' to murder 
 Hot as an infernary 
 But I clocked my dough verbally 
 Currently I push a benz out of Germany 
 Tryin' to stay alive till I'm old and in the nursery 
 My dead homies wife said today's they anniversary 
 His blood on the seat done dried and turned burgandy 
 Dead on arrival there was no need for surgery 
 Purposly left to die in his Mercury 
 But he was the smart nigga on his way to university 
 It's hurtin' me, that he's lyin' in the earth beneath 
 It's fucked how we dyin' over turfs of streets 
 I heard this beat so I had to be first to speak 
 Helpin' my raza seems to be what works for me 
 Certainly I got killers doin' dirt for free 
 Burst the heat 'cause I never learned to turn my cheek. 
 To the gunshow today 
 And buy a throw away 
 It's time to go to war is what the homies say 
 A different beat, a different rap 
 A different fool, a different gat 
 Sorry but we're never gonna go away.

 South Park Mexican: 
 Fast life 
 My mom says I'm a sad sight 
 Wake up and finish the coke I had last night 
 Glass pipes, surround my 2-bedroom trailer 
 Doctor feel good I graduated from Baylor 
 With Taylor made suits, real loose, a gym with masoose 
 My hood is full of hustlers and fiends that play their flutes 
 We shoot you first, I can see that my future's cursed 
 At the club with the gat inside my ruka's purse 
 To the hurse or to the nurse 
 You bitches gettin' to my nerves 
 Mad cause my song came on and your girlfriend knew the words 
 You stupid nerds 
 We pushin' birds 
 Aztecs run this universe 
 My people livin' blind cause every time they look it hurts 
 Now push reverse, way before the 2 benzes 
 Way before my bitch was wearin' 8,000 dollar dresses 
 I was broke but happy 
 But now I'm rich and angry 
 Cause you haters ain't got the nuts to say that you can't stand me.

 Low G: 
 En el segundo. 
 Won't you come and step to my mundo? 
 Soy prisionero 
 Este jale por si me muero 
 Es mi destino 
 Leavin' muertos en el camino 
 Soy assesino 
 Mi primo es el materino 
 Desiadado, wacth your back porque soy mojado 
 Violento ya tu sabes de donde vengo del centro 
 Atracando con mi matraca 
 Lone Star State that's my muthafuckin' placa 
 You heard about me ese vato si te mata 
 Como El Zapata a mi jente le doy la plata 
 Yo ando a pata los pinches haters no se escapan 
 Con El Chedar nunca jueges con mi dinero 
 Saco primero soy mas weno que un marinero 
 I se me muero mama entiera me en el ghetto. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Dope House impire strikes again 
 You jealous bitches say hello to my little friend.
