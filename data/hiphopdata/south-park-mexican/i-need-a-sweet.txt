South Park Mexican: 
 Man, let me call this boy up, man. 
 Man, your boy doin' bad. 
 Numbers being dialed: 
 Line Ringing: 
 Juan Gotti over phone: 
 Dope House Records. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 What up Gotti? Say man, I need a ride to the weed house, man. 
 Juan Gotti over phone: 
 For sure homeboy, I'll be right there. 
 (Chorus: South Park Mexican) 
 I Need A Sweet with short red hair 
 And when I Need A Sweet 
 I need it to be there 
 I Need A Sweet hear what I say 
 A killer sweet to get me through the day. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 I Need A Sweet 
 So I can blow 
 A $40 sweet 
 Full of indo 
 I got a buzz 
 Uh huh that's what I does 
 I put diamonds on my daughter's hairbrush 
 In these times of hate and pain 
 We need a remedy to get us out the rain 
 Jealousy, a little greed 
 I've been thinkin' of what I need 
 Purple leaves 
 With crystal flakes 
 If it's not hydro 
 Please get that out of my face 
 2 25 for a half a OZ 
 In the club, with my home boy Joey T. 
 My son's project, was in the school arena 
 'Cause I made a bong out this old steam cleaner "Ya mon". 
 (Chorus: South Park Mexican) 
 I Need A Sweet 
 With short red hair 
 And when I Need A Sweet 
 I need it to be there 
 I Need A Sweet hear what I say 
 A killer sweet to get me through the day, Help me out. 
 I Need A Sweet 
 I really do 
 I Need A Sweet. 
 Can I smoke with you? 
 I Need A Sweet 
 To get me right 
 I Need A Sweet everyday and everynight. 
 Angela Perez: 
 I Need A Sweet 
 To calm my nerves 
 A swisher sweet 
 Filled with killer herb 
 I wanna fill it roll it hit it smoke it hydroponics what I blow 
 It don't matter what time 
 I just wanna get high 
 The way I fein for the green's upscene 
 Always wanna smoke like a damn chimney 
 Muthafuckers call me Ms. Big Chief 
 But I don't give a fuck 'cause I love my weed 
 Step up in a club to the VIP 
 All the fuckin' baller's like up your sweets 
 Yet everybody know I make it H O T 
 Me and Mary Jane that's all I need. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Come on Beesh. 
 Baby Bash: 
 I need a S to the W double E T 
 If you smoke wit Baby Beesh don't tell the police 
 'Cause I'm on that paper man that's wrong 
 Caught with a sweet & a fat O zone 
 If you want that doe 
 I got a boat load 
 My girl got my baby mama in a choke hold 
 Smoke till my eyes turn Japanese 
 Me and Carlos lit half a tree 
 Now I don't pimp or jigalo 
 I blow big indo with my nigga ro's 
 Got a mouth full of cotton 'cause I'm off green butter 
 Marijuana man 
 I love her. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 This some good ass weed Beesh. 
 Baby Bash: 
 Ain't it though? 
 I wonder if they gon' play this on the radio 
 I hope so I need to pay my rent 
 Now split that sweet down the middle pimp. 
 (Chorus: South Park Mexican) 
 I Need A Sweet 
 With short red hair 
 And when I Need A Sweet 
 I need it to be there 
 I Need A Sweet hear what I say 
 A killer sweet to get me through the day, help me out. 
 I Need A Sweet 
 I really do 
 I Need A Sweet. 
 Can I smoke with you? 
 I Need A Sweet 
 To get me right 
 I Need A Sweet everyday and everynight. 
 I Need A Sweet everyday and everynight. 
 South Park Mexican:

 Baby Bash:
