 1st Verse: 
 One time muthafucker 
 reach for the sky 
 All I ever wanted was a piece of the pie 
 On this chrome Microphone 
 I can Do No Wrong and can only be held back 
 For so long on the tempo street info 
 How I riddow 
 If this nigga trip I turn his bitch into a widdow 
 Puffin' weed 
 5 Dunn Sunny D 
 Cyber real free shit comin' from a G 
 Suddenly the Summary Ain't where you wanna be 
 Underneath 100 G's keepin' death company 
 Quick triggers certified wig splitters ditch diggers 
 All about big figures 
 The last to laugh you don't have a chance 
 I come down like a muthafuckin' Avalanche 
 Blast yo' ass you think we won't answer back 
 Cancel that or we blow yo' fuckin' ass in half.

 2nd Verse: 
 We roc Rashade is also gettin' paid 
 Who give us a bald fade 
 Who got, just razor blades 
 Wit yo' options be away 
 The game of life'll be to play 
 Wit 5 aces of spades 
 3 small trick up the trade 
 Radicle renegade 
 Walked in this world to play 
 Bringin' faces 
 The top joker 
 Devil persuasive 
 Ain't it amazin' how this beer became 
 A cravin' add a fuckin' sweet 
 Give it tea to see some misbehavin' 
 Ain't no liftin' balls 
 Bitches mind be like ill 
 Put you down wit these southern skills 
 Then piss on yo' fuckin' grill 
 Grow deep wit back and gats and all stands 
 My boys gettin' prepared for neucin' 
 The war fair hands up in the air 
 Soldier's flippin' they fists 
 50 bald heads smoked out 
 Sloked out of piss 
 Infarred got it locked my man X 
 Marks the spot drench, then run that muthafucker down the block.

 Finally it's time to give my new block a try 
 Homerun hit a huge just poppin' flies 
 Fuckin' lies 
 Now I come and there be no compromise 
 Don't sleep so you better stay awake 
 The player mate gon' put yo' ass a real way 
 Mayday Mayday

 In the school bed I played a AK 
 It's midnight 
 Muthafuckin' fistfight 
 My clip lights hoes up quick light 
 My crib tight, keepin' my shit right 
 A hustla, my customers hit pipes 
 You heard of me doin' dirty Beach 
 To keep it the burglaries 
 My nigga chief came through with the hip hop 
 So when my shit dropped, yo' lip be on slip lock
