[Chorus:] Run away, run for your life, he's returned... 
 (South Park Mexican) 
 I ain't worked in two years guess who's back 
 Still my old album sell like crack 
 Blow indo out the window of my limo 
 Sleeping wit my in my pillow 
 I really don't give a damn who you are 
 Understand it you dealing wit a shooting star 
 Competition never heard if I hit permanent 
 Did I murder it, affirmative 
 The urban kid learning quick by earning grip 
 Got mo eight ball then a pool tournament 
 Swerven and lurvin, still cadilakin, still pack the Mack 
 And still by no rapkins 
 Drop like joranamo got piranha flow 
 You'd of been to young but yo mama now 
 I'm dip vicious never fictitious in this cause MC's so delicious 
 Run away 
 Run for your life 
 He's returned 
 Run away 
 Run for your life 
 He's returned... 
 (S.P.M.) 
 Like exakin get revenge 
 Never stop setting trends 
 To the level of excellence 
 Still, staking dead presidents 
 Its evident, I'm Texas sent 
 Whooplex get props on mesements 
 No referees selling cheese, enemies, memories, 
 Yes ory rest peace, been that way for centuries 
 Dead chemistry, a blessed fiend 
 We the men of empty dreams 
 My every Masterpiece influenced by street tragedies 
 Got family, try jakin me 
 A lot of fun that'll be 
 (S.P.M.) 
 White pasta, steak and lobster 
 Saut√© shrimp five different sauces 
 Crawfish, sausage, even Ostrich 
 Watch us run from the crack monster 
 Conciense, of the world that lost us 
 My Nina roisters, wonder what to cross us 
 Balers don't care what you call us 
 Living caucios taking no loses 
 Own my own office, got no accomplice 
 The thought of us just makes me nauseous 
 Promise mom this time its honest 
 Drop hits and make legitimate profit 
 Knowledge, from the street college 
 Reach for the top, just watch the copas 
 Imposters hate true mobsters 
 'Cause we lost trust and we all bust
