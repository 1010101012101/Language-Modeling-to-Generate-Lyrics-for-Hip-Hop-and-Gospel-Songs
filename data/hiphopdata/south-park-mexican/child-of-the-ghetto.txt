A Child of the Ghetto 
 Know how to sleng me an elbow 
 I made a deal with the devil 
 Then came up out the cevil 
 Kilo, so fuck a hero 
 In my back yard 
 Is now where my weed grow 
 I make the block bleed 
 Servin' fiends in need 
 I did my first murder 
 At the age of 17 
 So now it's biziteen 
 Imagen pinkie ring 
 Choppen up the scene 
 Candy coated limisune 
 So whatcha wanna see 
 I'm ballin' at 23 
 Sippin' down pea 
 This is my disteny 
 I'm pimpin' big canton 
 From Houston to San Anton 
 My pistol grip is chrome 
 Bustin' ballers at your dome 
 Took a trip to rome 
 But I made it back home 
 Sittin' all alone 
 I'm on the Latin Throne. 
 What! 
 I'm the Child of the Ghetto 
 I Said I'm the Child of the Ghetto. [x2] 
 Now weeto home boy 
 My people trip on the halle 
 My people killin' my people 
 And we don't know what to call it 
 Fuckin' a barrio war 
 For the niggas who live in a well 
 That get the right people who do can. 
 Never can go strong as the right?? 
 Dealin' with democrates 
 Eatin' like fuckin' rats 
 Jackin' with baseball bats 
 That's because your to poor to have a gat 
 Gotta da make it better way 
 But your sister won't let you 
 Trap deep in a jail cell 
 I be the locas who down 
 Fools don't you know my familia 
 Got ?? in shelter 
 I'm keepin' dose in the summer 
 I'm rockin' show's in the winter 
 Makin' somethin' for nothin' 
 And take the dreams we been chasin' 
 Now I'm hittin' licks with some tricks 
 Just to bring home some gravy 
 ?? On my rollex 
 I throw a grill on my lexis 
 I'm keepin' it real for my people 
 On the grind that have the hustle 
 To you vatos lowridin' and players 
 That got it made 
 Turn your life around now 
 And ask god for a better way! Uh! 
 I'm the Child of the Ghetto 
 I Said I'm the Child of the Ghetto. [x2] 
 Sometimes a nigga wish 
 That I can get away 
 From the shit today 
 Damn there's got to be 
 A better way 
 Don't you ever say that you can't 
 Get out your predicument 
 Change for the better 
 Cause don't know when I can give a shit 
 If you innocent, if you guilty and just sayin' it 
 Barely makin' it and muthafuckers say 
 That they hate me 
 Kick do's & batteries 
 Get for my family 
 Gotta ford the salary 
 That little sisters had the eat 
 It's sad to see that tradgity 
 And agginy of casuolty 
 Heard some niggas after me 
 And don't know the half of me 
 If that's the way it has to be 
 Then god let'em murder me 
 Standin' here today but 
 Don't know if I deserve to be 
 But I can't let it worry me 
 I gots to make My Feria 
 My only fear is god 
 So don't think I'll be a scared of ya 
 I stay 2 steps ahead of ya 
 So ain't nobody holdin' me 
 My boy's out here will bury ya. 
 So why don't you fuck over me?
