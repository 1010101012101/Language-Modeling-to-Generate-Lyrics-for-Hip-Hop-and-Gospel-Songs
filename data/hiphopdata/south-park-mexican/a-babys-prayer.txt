Now I'm laying down to sleep I press my heart and soul to keep. 
 Now should die before I wake. I pray's my lord my soul to take. 
 I love my mommy & I love my daddy & I love my whole family. 
 And dear lord please bring my daddy home safe, amen. 
 Dear Jesus please help us find a way. 
 I think we're lost...
