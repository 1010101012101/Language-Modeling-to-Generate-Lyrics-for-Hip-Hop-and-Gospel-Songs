 Verse 1: [Baby Bash:] 
 Now you be livin' that fast track 
 Chasin' that ass crack 
 I be makin' my money fuckin' without Jones and Nasdaq 
 We be blowin' on fat sacks 
 And catchin' amnesia with these heaters 
 Makin' believers out of haters and cheaters 
 You know that violence interrupts my dope trade 
 I just do the herb no cocaine 
 Don't be afraid boy 
 To be all about your bread boy 
 But watch that devil 'cause that devil he's a decoy 
 Destroy all that hate in your veins 
 Count your change and rearrange 
 Them games is played out man 
 Them dirty mess they want to stop it but I'm a player profit 
 I get the dope cook it up and re chop it. 
 Don't Let Them Fool Ya 
 We just come to school ya 
 Glory Glory Hallelujah 
 No red against no blue ya 
 Uh you know, uh you know. 
 Verse 2 [South Park Mexican:] 
 Smokin' smelly 
 I Put a hole in your belly. 
 You want to test us. Oh really? 
 Got a call on my celley 
 They want to bury us. 
 Ha, you fuckin' haters sound hilarious 
 The craziest, I turn the brave to the scariest 
 Smoke water and get wetter than Aquarius 
 Thuggish Ruggish million dollar budgets 
 I chop a bird and cook 36 Chicken Nuggets 
 My future is clear just like a shot of vodka 
 I got love from Corrpitos to Uganda 
 If you jealous listen up fellas 
 It's no problem to show you where hell is. 
 Don't Let Them Fool Ya 
 We just come to school ya 
 Glory Glory Hallelujah 
 No red against no blue ya 
 Uh you know, uh you know. 
 Verse 3: [Rasheed:] 
 While some niggas is stickin' with ya 
 Your murder is bein' choreographed 
 Soldier's never sleep I got your back in the aftermath 
 After the last laugh 
 When the muthafuckin' smoke clears 
 Niggas broke hear 
 Chokin' hangin' like chandliers 
 I bust at the man in the mirror 
 Makin' my face crack 
 But blaze that Rasheed Dope House killer 
 Keep it comin' back or runnin' back 
 With a ball and chain in my hand 
 Ain't no substain in the man with the vision of the Galaxy span. 
 Verse 4: [Low-G:] 
 Respect that 
 It's the million dollar wetback 
 In jet black 
 You cross my lane and get your head cracked 
 Yeah yeah ya tu sabes qien soy 
 Don't sweat me boy 
 Ya tu sabes donde estoy. 
 I'm on the Hunt G 
 The only street with the palm tree 
 It's Low-G 
 I only rap about what is done G 
 You can't stop me 
 Came to your city on a donkey 
 The savior I'm bringin' back the wet flavor! 
 Don't Let Them Fool Ya 
 We just come to school ya 
 Glory Glory Hallelujah 
 No red against no blue ya 
 Uh you know, uh you know. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 He's on crack 
 She's on snow 
 He's so old he can't fuck no more 
 She's a whore 
 He's a snitch 
 Most of my niggas dyin' over a bitch.
