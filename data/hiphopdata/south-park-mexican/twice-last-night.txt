 Baby Bash: 
 We did it Twice Last Night 
 And once in the mornin'. 
 We did it Twice Last Night 
 And once in the mornin'. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 I pulled out my jimmy from the cracker jack box 
 The bullet proof vest blockin' all my come shots 
 I got one in London and her name is Regina 
 Then I got Sophia she's from Argentina 
 Love 'em and leave 'em hell naw that ain't my style 
 I'd rather stick around for a good little while 
 At least twice a week if she's a good freak 
 Bitch left a hicky on my left ass cheek 
 Man I'm as strong as an ox 
 And your baby mother's a bopper 
 We call her the head doctor 
 And nobody can stop her 
 You need to drop her 
 Cause all she really wants is a baller 
 That spends 50,000 dollars 
 On the Mexican boxer... 
 Baby Bash: 
 We did it Twice Last Night 
 And once in the mornin'. 
 We did it Twice Last Night 
 And once in the mornin'. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 She's ridin' my pony Man she's horny 
 But it ain't no fun if I can't call the homey 
 Early in the mornin' watchin' Erkel while she blow me 
 When she see me with my girlfriend 
 She act's like she don't know me 
 'Cause she got love for me 
 My balls are never lonely 
 Call me crazy with that ass 
 And them pretty cheecharonies 
 In my room jammin' oldies 
 She's dancin' in her chonies 
 Had her screamin' in the deli 
 Till the neighbors call the police 
 So we had to take it else where 
 Take it to the embassy 
 Picked up her stripper friend with lesbian tendencies 
 Half black and Japanese 
 Gone on them dakeries 
 My bitch ate her out 
 While I filled up her cavities 
 Then we did it... 
 Baby Bash: 
 Twice Last Night 
 And once in the mornin'. 
 We did Twice Last Night 
 And once in the mornin'. 
 Baby Bash: 
 She grabbed me by my paw & I said: "Aw Naw." 
 Rushed me to the bed and jumped straight on my jaw 
 The next thing she saw playboy wasn't small 
 She asked Baby Bash can I please take it all, fo' sho' 
 She me & I'm yum yum 
 Man we was doin' it big 
 She make me come come 
 Damn I think I woke up the kid 
 But we was on one 
 With some help of dosia and wine 
 I gotta freak one 
 Ain't no bitch colder then mine 
 She got that platinum punana 
 Fuck Madonna and Jenny Jenny 
 My mama be on that remmy 
 Mixed with henny when she get me 
 And when I get her I gotta 
 Hotter then enchilada 
 Oh she brought her friend too 
 Now it's a menage a trois 
 Against the wall let the camera record 
 Got the berries and the cream so we can never be bored 
 She kissed that teta. 
 Told her nena would you please kiss your friend? 
 She said you know I can dadda. 
 But is you joinin' in? 
 I said fo' showly 
 We started off slowly 
 Once it hit midnight we went hard to 1:40 
 And then at 2:30 she started talkin' dirty 
 Got me feelin' like a champ 
 When I'm dip up in the furry 
 45 minutes straight 
 Drippin' wet took a power nap 
 6:00 in the mornin' got wetter than a shower cap 
 She was on top & I was up under 
 The b a b a bed hit the wall and it sounded like thunder. 
 Thunder crashing: 
 Baby Bash: 
 We did it Twice Last Night 
 And once in the mornin'. 
 We did it Twice Last Night 
 And once in the mornin'.
