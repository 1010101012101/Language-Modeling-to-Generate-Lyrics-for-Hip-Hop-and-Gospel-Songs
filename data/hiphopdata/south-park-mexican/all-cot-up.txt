South Park Mexican: 
 I might not know what to say, rollin' up in my mercury 
 I'm on the sea and private toys, mama told me I had to kill them boys 
 My homeboy's name is little troy, me my name is Carlos Coy 
 Roll on 22 inch alloys, but that'll never be my pride and joy 
 My little girl she off the hook, make my ass stop and read a book 
 On her stove know'n' how to cook, now I know how an angel look 
 My beauty queen, My billy jean, some they come right in between 
 I don't let nobody fuck-up my dreams, so I pack bubble gum machines 
 Everybody wanna wanna wanna be the king, bitch get off my ding-a-ling 
 I'll soke yo' ass in gaseline now listen to my bad girl sing. 
 He's All Cot Up. [x4] 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Me and my boys we sellin' weed, still I gotta slang that pappy seed 
 Snatch yo' bitch and rock a G, now bitch get yo' ass of a me 
 Kick her out my fuckin' room, now they wakin' me up at Noon 
 Fuck that shit I'll take my time, I ain't leave till 3:09 
 Hold up man now stop the lac, I think I forgot my bomb bomb sack 
 With my homeboy lonny mack, I'm a smoke till I have a uh cardiac 
 Where my army at, stay on attack, one good shot and we all react 
 I smell a rat, so I fed the cat, me be cool oh never that 
 My chedder's that, I'll get the gat, both my pockets hella fat 
 I'm a democrat. What the hell is that? Take my shit better mail it back. 
 He's All Cot Up. 
 He's All Cot Up. 
 He's All Cot Up. 
 When does the fuckin' first command? 
 He's All Cot Up. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Screwston TX where I roam, bought me a home off a telephone 
 Took my wife on a trip to rome and bought my girlfriend silicone 
 That vanilla bone, in the killer zone, 5 foot 9 with high heelers on 
 I sip batron, flip my phone, left that pearl white bitch alone 
 Most my friends ain't around, dead, locked up, or just can't be found 
 I keep my little girl safe and sound, daddy gonna buy a cinderella gown 
 And if that gown should disappear, heaven is real but it isn't here 
 You can't take no souviners, like those diamonds in your ears 
 Raised my daughter differently 'cause the life I lived won't set me free 
 Write my list of enemies and kill them hoes alphabetically 
 Uh.
