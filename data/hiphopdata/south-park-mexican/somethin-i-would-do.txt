(South Park Mexican:) 
 I ain't got the last 2 sentences to this verse. 
 (Grimm:) 
 Then just freestyle it. 
 (South Park Mexican:) 
 All right, I can do that. 
 1st Verse (South Park Mexican): 
 Bring it back, drop the top on the 'Lac 
 Screw put the tap on the wet Fatback 
 Got the black gat, can't come wack 
 'Member when clubs wouldn't let me rap 
 Now they call me up, all on nuts 
 Get 'em for about 10,000 bucks 
 Sippin' on Dom Perigion 
 5, 6 songs and my ass is gone 
 Made a wrong catch or tone, grab my phone 
 See if my boy Baby Bash is home 
 From San Anton to the Astrodome 
 Smoke weed with Cheech and hash with Chong 
 2:00 A.M. sunglasses on 
 "Twice Last Night" that's my nastiest song 
 Now it's on, ask my T. Jones 
 Seem like the whole World on my ding-dong. 
 (Baby Bash:) 
 Take 2 hits and pass it on to you... 
 (South Park Mexican:) 
 Yeah that sounds like Somethin' I Would Do. 
 (Baby Bash:) 
 Fill my swimmin' pool up with some brew. 
 (South Park Mexican:) 
 Yeah that sounds like Somethin' I Would Do. 
 2nd Verse (South Park Mexican): 
 Well I'm S.P.Mex in the place to be 
 And I went to Bedrock University 
 I hang with the poor and steal from the rich 
 I chill with the real & I won't never switch 
 Jump out the bed, come from the head 
 Last name Flintstone, first name Fred 
 My low-low, hop like a pogo 
 Walkin' down the yellow brick road with a dog named Toto 
 Run from no one 'cause I might get a cramp 
 10 dollar stone for 'bout 20 food stamps 
 Money ain't happiness, y'all some fools 
 Your baby's brown eyes in some diamonds and jewels. 
 (Baby Bash:) 
 Smokin' chokin' on PP LePew... 
 (South Park Mexican:) 
 Yeah that sounds like Somethin' I Would Do. 
 (Baby Bash:) 
 Make a dollar bill turn into 2... 
 (South Park Mexican:) 
 Yeah that sounds like Somethin' I Would Do. 
 3rd Verse (South Park Mexican): 
 You wanna play with the S, ha? 
 25 on my dresser 
 White tank-top, Dickie's from fiesta 
 Slow and low, here we go 
 Doin' the impossible 
 Jam rock and roll 
 Exotic cold 
 I done lost my high a lil' while ago 
 Put away your gun, have some fun 
 Not no star, but I'm stabbin' one 
 A stallion, saddle up the horses 
 My Girl gorgeous, I bought a fortress 
 2 divorces and only lost a Corvette 
 My 3rd wife 
 still 
 ain't born yet 
 No sweat, I relax in Houston 
 I'm the one that went gold, with no distribution 
 Rhymin' now them hoes mine & 
 Your boy went from muthafuckin' dimes to diamonds. 
 (Baby Bash:) 
 Drop my top and pick up DJ Screw. 
 (South Park Mexican:) 
 Yeah that sounds like Somethin' I Would Do.

 Show my love, I'll show it back to you...

 Yeah that sounds like Somethin' I Would Do.

 Tell your kid to stay his ass in school...

 Step on stage and act just like a fool...

 Make my girl sneak in my 22. 
 (South Park Mexican:) 
 Yeah that sounds like Somethin' I Would Do. 
 (Baby Bash:) 
 Say Homeboy you stepped in Doggy-Doo. 
 Go outside and please wash off your shoe. 
 (South Park Mexican:) 
 Say Grimm, roll another Baby dick and let's get high, fo' sho'. 
 (Laughter until track ends)
