South Park Mexican: 
 "Yo I can't hear myself on the mic. 
 Uh yeah maybe I can." 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Now take a trip off the trip and let me trip you out, 
 'Cause I'm a trip, I'm a nut, I'm a fool no doubt. 
 Y'all boys really tripin' on the money I make 
 But I'm trippin' wet tryin' to kill some putos I hate. 
 Separate all these fake niggas all in my face 
 You a disgrace, you should wish well for your own race 
 Tie your laces and hide your 2 faces 
 I Guess I been lookin' for love in all the wrong places 
 Follow in a trail to the land of hell 
 Everybody knows I belong in hell 
 For my Raza, anyone else no tienen chanza 
 Fuck with my clique, I'll put a hole in your panza 
 I give 2 fucks 3 shits & 1 damn 
 Scram you bitch you ain't worth my fan 
 I don't cut for the jealous 
 Guess where your girl is 
 All on my penis like mustard and relish. 
 Oh My My, oh hell yeah 
 Let's all get to puttin' some in the air 
 Fix me a drink and sing me a song 
 But do it quick baby 'cause I can't stay long. 
 Oh My My, oh hell yeah 
 Let's all get to puttin' some in the air 
 Man I'm so blowed 
 Man I'm so throwed 
 Somebody grab the wheel I can't see the road. 
 (2nd Verse: South Park Mexican) 
 Mama Mia 
 I wanna put somethin' in Aaliyah 
 Sippin' Sangria and smokin' on Maria 
 I drill a 9 milli through your liver I'm triller 
 Lonestar state home of the armadiller 
 Blow killer with Prisciller and ganja with Blanca 
 Catch me at the club in my Nike chanclas 
 Vida chueca, my girlfriend's name is La Mu'eca 
 Dios around my necka 
 Sangre de Azteca 
 SPM on choppers like man 
 Y'all run and hide while I count to 10 
 I'm a wait till fall then I'll cut my grass 
 Stop and make my girlfriend pump the gas 
 I got enough birds to have a snowball fight 
 My dream is to keep the world up all night 
 I done sold you a dub sack 
 Used to chase a hub cap 
 Now I'm in this game tryin' to see where my love at. 
 Oh My My, oh hell yeah 
 Let's all get to puttin' some in the air 
 Fix me a drink and sing me a song 
 But do it quick baby 'cause I can't stay long. 
 Oh My My, oh hell yeah 
 Let's all get to puttin' some in the air 
 Man I'm so blowed 
 Man I'm so throwed 
 Somebody grab the wheel I can't see the road. 
 (3rd Verse: Baby Bash) 
 It's the return of that nut, Baby Beeshie. 
 Love my chicken greasy 
 Shitin' on them haters that love to taste the feces 
 I'm a fool I'm a nutter 
 Gone off the butter 
 I'm from Vallejo, California Houston to Calcutter 
 Gone wacko off tobacco mixed with the dough dough 
 You squares ain't ready for the modern day cholo 
 Used to be a player but now I'm an official 
 Doin' big things like Shine and Pen and Pixel 
 Only nigga with a Benz still on welfare 
 No insurance, no license and no health care. 
 Computer illiterate 
 Smoke dank like a cigarette 
 A straight fuckin' idiot. 
 You think that I give a shit? 
 I need a hearin' aid for some handicap parkin' 
 Damn Baby Bash your so damn retarded. 
 Oh My My, oh hell yeah 
 Let's all get to puttin' some in the air 
 Fix me a drink and sing me a song 
 But do it quick baby 'cause I can't stay long. 
 Oh My My, oh hell yeah 
 Let's all get to puttin' some in the air 
 Man I'm so blowed 
 Man I'm so throwed 
 Somebody grab the wheel I can't see the road.
