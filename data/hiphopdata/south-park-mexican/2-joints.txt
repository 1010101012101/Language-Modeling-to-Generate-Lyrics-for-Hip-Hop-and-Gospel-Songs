(Verse 1: Dum-Dum and Happy P.) 
 Dum-Dum: 
 I hit it from worst ways 
 After the first day 
 I'm needin' it everyday 
 And twice on a Thursday 
 Blood thick than water 
 In pounds better than quarters 
 I smokin' 2 Joint's 
 While I'm knockin' down yo' daughter 
 Dope House Records is on fire 
 So grab the estinguisher 
 I smoked out in the beamer 
 About to get emphezema 
 Gun slingers rap singers 
 With more stripe than the bengals 
 No need for the gang sign 
 I'm usin' my trigger finger. 
 Happy P.: 
 Now won't you roll one 
 Po' the 4 one 
 Sometimes I'm real selfish & I'll smoke my weed with no one 
 You know me 
 I'm young Happy P 
 Kick back and blow a sweet 
 While my niggas move ki's 
 Bitch please 
 I got G's 
 Sippin' corona with lima squeeze 
 And platinum P's 
 Only smoke on the fine leaves 
 I started out 
 Sellin' $5 tweets 
 And now I'm hella paid 
 Sellin' 5000 dollar beats. 
 (Chorus: Grimm) 
 I smoke 2 Joint's when I wake up 
 In the car I smoke 2 Joint's 
 I smoke 2 Joint's when in play video games 
 And every 10,000 points 
 I smoke 2 Joint's in time of piece 
 And 2 in time of war ar 
 I smoke 2 Joint's before I smoke 2 Joint's 
 And then I smoke 2 more. 
 Verse 2: South Park Mexican and Low-G: 
 South Park Mexican: 
 Man this killer herb got me runnin' over curbs 
 And writing these raps full of misspelled words 
 I curse on my verse snatch yo' bitch like a purse 
 'Cause she like the twinkies that I slapped on my herse 
 I take 2 charges it's really quite harmless 
 The only side effect is that it makes you retarded [laugh] 
 I started in 82 
 In 5th grade 
 You can say I was in high school 
 True smoker. 
 Low-G: 
 I got married at an early age 
 Con mi hermosa 
 Maria es mi esposa 
 Mi sanchas Nina Rosa 
 Mafiosa 
 Pero eso es otra cosa 
 My wife es celosa 
 No llores mariposa 
 Tan chiclosa 
 Te traigo from coasta a coasta 
 I got your corazon dropped en mi bolsa 
 Borrachos de tu besos 
 Oja pa mi huesos 
 Me trais pesos 
 Con hildao pa me seso. 
 (Chorus: Grimm) 
 I smoke 2 Joint's when I wake up 
 In the car I smoke 2 Joint's 
 I smoke 2 Joint's when in play video games 
 And every 10,000 points 
 I smoke 2 Joint's in time of piece 
 And 2 in time of war ar 
 I smoke 2 Joint's before I smoke 2 Joint's 
 And then I smoke 2 more. 
 (Verse 3: Diamond and Grimm) 
 Diamond: 
 Dimaond pop the baller scene 
 Smoke 2 Joint's where I can beam 
 Flip the scene bizatines 
 Sippin' lean sticky green 
 Come out fresh when it spring 
 Steady flossin' diamond rings 
 Bustin' gats with Bing 
 Catchin' squares at 10 
 Baby Beeshi got the throne 
 Happy P. We fitin' to roll 
 And shut 'em down we livin' throwed 
 Got the keys 
 We got the vo's 
 Hit and run cause the scheme 
 Rush your head and feel my spin 
 Since diamond came around 
 Now she down with a team. 
 Grimm: 
 Now I'm down with Bobby Brown 
 But I love Al Green 
 Keep a sweet in my mouth and another in my jeans 
 About to blow 'em back to back takin' 2 to the dome 
 Home grown hydroponic always wanna get blown 
 Stay stoned at home 
 Drop a flow rock a show 
 Got to go out the do 
 Boppin' hoe after close 
 No hit's snow switch 
 Place a pink in my eye 
 And I'm always down wit tryin' new ways to reach for the sky 
 (Chorus: Grimm) 
 I smoke 2 Joint's when I wake up 
 In the car I smoke 2 Joint's 
 I smoke 2 Joint's when in play video games 
 And every 10,000 points 
 I smoke 2 Joint's in time of piece 
 And 2 in time of war ar 
 I smoke 2 Joint's before I smoke 2 Joint's 
 And then I smoke 2 more. 
 (Verse 4: Baby Bash and Lil' Bing) 
 Baby Bash: 
 Now I be blowin' when it's mo' than one but less than three 
 That's the recipe 
 Yes indeed blowin' oooey gooey a neccesity 
 Don't question me 
 Blowin' heavily till I'm 70 
 That's the remedy 
 Feelin' famous like the Kennedy's 
 From here to Tennessee sippin' hennesse 
 Smokin' with intensity 
 Feel my ghetto energy 
 Fools be sweatin' me for that rush in the Lebanese 
 I be gettin' higher than the hills of Beverly Beverly. 
 Lil' Bing: 
 2 Joint's be smellay in my Cadi 
 Drivin' badly ti Cali 
 Hastled by federalis 
 Drippin' candy 
 Sippin' brandy 
 20 inches look fancy 
 On my way to the grammys 
 Hoes droppin' they panties 
 Got a freak named Sandy 
 Makin' hits like Sammie 
 I'm posted up with biscuits and chicken fried steak at Grandy's 
 Smashin' off man fo' sho' 
 Got my TV's on glow 
 Smokin' 2 smokin' 4 
 Then mo' with 2 mo'. 
 (2 mo' repeats till fade:)
