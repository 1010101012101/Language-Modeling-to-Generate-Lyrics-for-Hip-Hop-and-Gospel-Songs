Stay On Your Grind "Oh I know I know I you know" 
 Stay On Your Grind "My people, oh" 
 Stay On Your Grind "Everybody" 
 Stay On Your Grind "& can you feel me yeah" 
 Hustlaz 
 Don't give a fucksters 
 And we smoke like broke down mufflers 
 Paint pictures 
 Write scriptures 
 At the beach 
 30 deep ridin' ninjas 
 Smoke a owl think I can't go without it 
 Me and my crew we always joke about it 
 In the back of the tour bus 
 With a gorgeous 
 Little hoe just fuckin' all 4 of us 
 The game Lord it's the drugs and fast hoes 
 Hotel's with the bed's with brass poles 
 Sip gallons 
 Can't keep my balance 
 I'm a have to shine like the boy Ritchie Valens 
 Iced medallion 
 Got a thick stallion 
 700 pounds comin' straight from Megallon 
 Dog's of the leashes 
 Oh my Jesus 
 Leave in peace or leave in pieces. 
 Stay On Your Grind "My brother" 
 Stay On Your Grind "Still They teach us yeah" 
 Stay On Your Grind "My people" 
 Stay On Your Grind "& everybody" 
 I'm a fly like Vince 
 Bubble like Prince 
 Mama just ain't been the same ever since 
 She can't believe I got all these fans 
 And she won't stop savin' aluminum cans 
 I'm swangin' and swervin' 
 Woodson and Worthin' 
 Used to break dance against boys up in Sturdon 
 But that was '82 
 I was actin' a fool 
 The only Mexican in the whole damn school 
 The game will eat your ass up if you let it 
 That was back when crack was the epidemic 
 I'm a represent it 
 My house ain't rented 
 Always kept it real while you boys pretended 
 Lace my Pippins 
 Cook my chickens 
 They shot my boy missed me by inches 
 Now my flow harder than my dick is 
 You can't see me unless you buy some tickets. 
 Stay On Your Grind "& can you feel me yeah" 
 Stay On Your Grind "Oh you special now" 
 Stay On Your Grind "The police baby" 
 Stay On Your Grind "My sister's oh" 
 I'm a stay about my paper 
 Built my house on a solid acre 
 Used to be broke 
 But I ain't trippin' on that 
 It's 2002 I'm a flip in my 'Lac 
 And get gone in the wind 
 Chrome on the rim 
 Hope we can all get along in the end, my friend 
 Player hatin's a sin 
 I got men that'll check you chinny-chin-chin 
 All his homeboy's need revenge 
 Smokin' bunk weed full of seeds and stems 
 I'm a interceptor off the record 
 Can't stand clubs with the metal detectors 
 I'm a movie director like Hannibal Lecter 
 I tried to mix codeine with Dr. Pepper 
 But it taste like medicine 
 I'm fightin' and wrestlin' 
 Man the damn life of the SP Mexican. 
 Stay On Your Grind "Talkin' 'about my brother yeah" 
 Stay On Your Grind "& if you feelin' me" 
 Stay On Your Grind "Yeah well well well" 
 Stay On Your Grind "mm hmm you gotta Stay On Your Grind baby" 
 Stay On Your Grind 
 Stay On Your Grind "Oh" 
 Stay On Your Grind "Stay On Your Grind baby yeah" 
 Stay On Your Grind. 
 I know and you know 
 And Dope House Records know baby yeah 
 And Wreck Shop and everybody. 
 You gotta Stay On Your Grind 
 If you wanna get paid you gotta move things baby. 
 Oh, yeah. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Oh, yeah Stay On Your Grind.
