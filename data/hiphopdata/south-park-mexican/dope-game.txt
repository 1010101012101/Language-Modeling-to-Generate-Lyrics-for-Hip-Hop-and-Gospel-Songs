Check 1, check 2, let's take a cruise 
 I done did the game every which way but loose 
 Nothin' left to do except collect my cash 
 And I bet that ass that the Mex gon' last 
 Put the past on paper, threw away my pager 
 Cause these boys keep callin' from loc's to Cookie Baker 
 Mama saved 'em from the hate, now I'm hard with the pain 
 I'm in the place in your face tryin' to sell you a tape 
 I break records in Texas creepin' in Caddies and Benz's 
 And a pretender if he step up to the bullet bartender 
 I bet I check and wreck a sucker ridin' bumper to bumper 
 I might dump the whole clip and miss and hit your uncle 
 I ain't trippin' flippin' sippin' on purple Lipton 
 Diggin' Bivd in the drop lemon, G livin' 
 I was driven to my last nerve, hittin' curbs 
 Puttin' 20's on a grass hurst 
 End of verse. 
 No shame 
 Welcome to the Dope Game 
 This is were we don't play 
 Leave your boys with no brains 
 Whoridas. [x2] 
 I remember long ago I never got no love 
 Still I knew that one day I'd be popular 
 I used to stand in the circle tryin' to smoke your bud 
 Just hopin' that the blunt wouldn't pass me up 
 I used to ask for a sip of your syrup 
 I used to never walk around with the white cup 
 Now I eat 18 steaks on silver plates 
 Girls fanin' my face, others feedin' me grapes 
 By the grace of God, I was given the job 
 To run through the rap game like corn on the cob 
 So blessed in my test, I bought my set's in the southwest 
 I ain't got no credit cards except Mexican Express 
 I'm a dress my baby girl and rock the whole damn world 
 If you needs tracks Happy P got my referral 
 Your head twirl to the sounds of the SP Mex 
 Ridin' in the Lex with a dog named Plex 
 Southside to the north, at the old golf course 
 The valet the white Porsche with the bulletproof doors. 
 No shame 
 Welcome to the Dope Game 
 This is were we don't play 
 Leave your boys with no brains 
 Whoridas. [x2] 
 It's the L O S C O Y 
 Pack the pistola, oh me oh my 
 My nina shine like the sun, I never ask for a crumb 
 For breakfast my chef makes me eggs-fuyon 
 I've come from the hills of ghetto thrills and chills 
 3 wheelin' dope dealin' killin' nothin' but squeels 
 My 3rd Wish was to break this curse and myth 
 Now I'm worldwide status on your satilite dish 
 Punk checker, chump wrecker, got the salt and the pepper 
 Left a mark in the game and never been a half stepper 
 Leopard skin on my couch, be like Oscar the Grouch 
 From the streets pullin' rocks out my kangaroo pouch 
 But I told these boys, never at my house 
 Whether it's the ounce that put's leather on my couch 
 A thousand dollar's a week, my baby girl's allowance 
 Dope House bouncin' cash to my forgein accounts. 
 No shame 
 Welcome to the Dope Game 
 This is were we don't play 
 Leave your boys with no brains 
 Whoridas. [x2]
