"Woodson N Worthin" 
 SPM:

 The bake hood bring me some bake 
 Hey Filero pull up bass in this song 
 Man I don't hear no bass ok 
 Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo 
 Here we go man 
 Smoke on the kill popped up on three wheel 
 Want another peel naw nigga I'ma chill 
 Gone off the X it's the SP-Mex 
 Just made 2 twenty-thousand dollar bets 
 Hoes wanna speak nah I need a freak 
 I be freestyle flowing in my sleep 
 Out to Hous-tone that's my dam home 
 I like to get high I need a bowl of Honeycomb 
 Man put 'em up man I can't quit 
 I need a forty and a forty cigarette 
 Down for my raza mira lo que pasa 
 When it get hot I'ma have to buy a raspa 
 Maybe orchata check my palabras 
 I like girls with the real pretty patas 
 Ima throw vato back to chase gato 
 SPM mean South Park Mojado 
 1 in a billion V-12 engine 
 In the same city with Destiny's Children 
 I'm off the rocka peace to Lil' Papa 
 I be the ship its better shamda kaka 
 I'ma take a picture of you're but naked sister 
 And my killas got more pliers than wrencha 
 Gangsta gangsta read all about it 
 22 holes in ya' brand new outfit 
 Feestyle flow is all I come with 
 I don't give a fuck y'all stupid dumb bitch 
 In the land of g's smoking QP's 
 Smoke on kill I'ma smoke trees 
 Man I get crunked do what with my thang 
 Swang lang lang in the mothafucking brain 
 Dumb diddy dum did I did I get dumb 
 I'ma get my gun I'ma shoot off your thumb 
 Shoot you in the buns I mean the dam ass 
 I'ma get a glass and than pull up some rasp 
 Mothafucking berry with a lil cherry 
 My mothafuckin niggas is so dam very 
 So dam very mothafuckin scary 
 With the mothafucking what what the Dirty Harry 
 I'ma say hi to my favorite cities 
 I don't even care if they what little bitty 
 I get on my knees and I thank the Lord 
 Whipping boys down with my microphone cord 
 Swurl to the world diamonds and pearls 
 All my girls died like Devirl Ashurl 
 Straw to the nose curl up my toes 
 Selling that cane to them buttnaked hoes 
 Man I ain't foolish but I do talk to bullets 
 Better tell ya boys to cool it 
 'Cause I grab it and I pull it man 
 As I look up at the sky 
 My eye starts bliking a tear drops my eye 
 My body temperature falls 
 I'm shakin can they break in 
 Tryin' to save a dog 
 Second Verse: 
 Man I put it down I ain't tryin' to trip 
 But I talk shit in the syrup I'ma sip 
 Peace to Lil' Flip and my big homie Hump 
 Hillwood Cloverland Sunnyside ain't no pump 
 Trowed from the jump purple ice in my cup 
 Man I gotta have it I ain't lying I'm in love 
 With the codine on the Martin Luther King 
 Left on crest crump creep creep my sterling like a hole scene 
 I'm a mothafucken hook pirex get shoked 
 I sell dope on foot I'ma understand I'ma 
 Hustling man rock the white sand 
 Wash the white van get the fuck 
 Out if you see y'all jump out 
 Undercover cops got their eyes 
 On the south just bought a house 
 Never took a louse everything 
 I got come from a quarter ounce 
 That's what I started in the game with 
 Niggas short stoping at the bunny what ridge 
 If they want bricks gotta come to the 
 Hill taking no less than a ten dollar bill 
 You can have the three five seven 
 Dollar pieces I'ma dress like a fein no 
 Gold and no creses I got my gun 
 No time for fun is Saturday night

 Orlens way scott plaza Woodson 'n' Worthin 
 Patna cause as I hillwood hustla that's my damm click 
 Were we like to sell bricks and we like to 
 Fight pits I just had puppies but somebody 
 Stoled my dogs I'm telling young niggas I don't

 Forty five hundred jolly rancher in my car man
