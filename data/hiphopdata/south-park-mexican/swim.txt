I was 3 when my old man left in the wind 
 Pushed me in the ocean, turned around and said "Swim" 
 That's what I did even though I was scared 
 I kept kickin' 'cause a person only floats when he's dead. 
 If I had one wish, It wouldn't be wealth 
 It would be that if we could just love ourselves 
 'Cause every day it's like we kill a million dreams 
 And it seems everybody on different teams 
 I don't mean to get deep, I'm just speakin' the truth 
 We in a 2-bed trailer with a leak in the roof 
 I ate potatoes every way you could ever make'em 
 When your hungry gotta use your imagination 
 My mom did her best, she would hug and kiss me 
 Even though we had more fuckin' mice than Disney 
 I still had some polo's & plenty new draws 
 While she was livin' life with the same two bras 
 And lightning strikes like Garth say thunder rolls 
 Life is cold like an Eskimo in summer clothes 
 I suffer softly, but never let nothin' stop me 
 And I miss my little girl like somebody shot me. 
 They walk on me until I die 
 Take me to die so now they'll come around. [Repeated in background]

 I be prison made cross, fuck diamonds and jewels 
 Still flyer then Jordan when he was runnin' with bulls 
 So many shots had missed, so many cops was pissed 
 So many songs I have written in the past on this 
 It's alot of imposters try to tell you the same. 
 But How the fuck can I explain? No one knows my pain 
 From the cord on my navel I was a G from the cradle 
 I don't snort 'cause they say that bitch Caine killed Abel 
 I'm not sure you understand it but I must express it 
 Santa Claus is on heroine, there ain't no presents 
 And Mom all this shit makes my eyes so watery 
 Now I understand why you tried to win the lottery 
 We gon' make it I promise, don't let the memories haunt us 
 I remember we was at the bus stop in pajamas 
 Tryin' to run from a home that brought so many tears 
 Bad luck like we must've broke a thousand mirrors. 
 They walk on me until I die 
 Take me to die so now they'll come around. [Repeated in background]
