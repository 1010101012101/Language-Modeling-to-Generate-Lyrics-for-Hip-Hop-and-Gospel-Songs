South Park Mexican talkin: 
 Hustle Town my city man! 
 Born and raised baby 
 Yo I dedicate this jam to all the single mother's 
 Raisin' men in a big city 
 I know it's hard 
 Let 'em know what's up Filero. 
 (Verse 1: Filero) 
 I sell drugs with thugs 
 Hittin' licks off tricks 
 Workin' 2 jobs a dope dealer & a pimp 
 Mom's beggin' me to stop everyday 
 So scared for me to walkâ?¦. Memory lane 
 But Mom don't worry my teck protect well 
 I told you one day this rap shit gon' sell 
 'Cause my heart been broke from the start 
 Since the day my father died when I was 7 in the park 
 So I wrote the book 
 How to pimp hoes and kick do's 
 And if I kill well than that's just how this shit goes 
 Pull yo' strap. 
 What am I supposed to sweat? 
 This the 3rd time today that I come close to death. 
 (Chorus: South Park Mexican) 
 Hustle Town Hustle Town 
 The city of dreams 
 Where we creep through the hood 
 And we serve them dope fiends 
 Hustle Town 
 This shit don't stop 
 Roll rental cars 
 And we keep the glock clocked 
 Hustle Town 
 The city of dreams 
 Where we creep through the hood 
 And we serve them dope fiends 
 Hustle Town 
 This shit don't stop 
 Roll rental cars 
 And we keep the glock clocked. 
 (Verse 2: South Park Mexican) 
 Set 'em up 
 Wet 'em up 
 Etceteras 
 Tell your treasura 
 Empty the regista 
 Shit serious 
 I'll give your life a period 
 Well here he is 
 It's The kid with experience 
 Don't start shit 
 Mistake me for an artist 
 Flash in the dark 
 Someone tell 'em where his heart is 
 Blue light. 
 Who die? 
 Tonight 
 Maybe over 2 dice 
 Maybe 'cause he blew fry 
 On top of ya 
 With that Hillwood Mafia 
 Hard hittin' hustlaz 
 Beat the draws off of ya 
 Knowledge 
 While my shit be flawless 
 Dope House Records step into my office. 
 (Chorus: South Park Mexican) 
 Hustle Town Hustle Town 
 The city of dreams 
 Where we creep through the hood 
 And we serve them dope fiends 
 Hustle Town 
 This shit don't stop 
 Roll rental cars 
 And we keep the glock clocked 
 Hustle Town 
 The city of dreams 
 Where we creep through the hood 
 And we serve them dope fiends 
 Hustle Town 
 This shit don't stop 
 Roll rental cars 
 And we keep the glock clocked.

 Wit a cold 40-ounce & a sack of hay 
 Chug a lug for the thugs who done passed away 
 Mista da Masta Mystical Mexican Maniac

 You's a bitch if you hatin' on my Houston hits 
 I fight devil's like you wit a crucifix 
 Ruthless shit

 Mixed wit AK Karate 
 I'm sorry but you the past like Atari 
 As I smoke like Marty 
 Stay Brown like Charlie.
