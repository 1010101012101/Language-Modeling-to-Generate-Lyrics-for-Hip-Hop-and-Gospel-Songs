This One's for those on the dead end street 
 Hustlin' hard to make all they ends meet 
 I hope one day I see yo' benz creep 
 Watch for the jealousy that most friends keep 
 S.P. got the Bentley 
 All I can do is thank god 'cause he blessed me 
 I used to be just like you 
 Slangin' crack rock on the avenue 
 Packin' glocks and runnin' from cops 
 Most of my clients like they cane on the rocks 
 Gun shots like 2 blocks away 
 I wonder who the fuck caught a hot one today 
 Never mind 'cause I don't wanna know 
 I just lost 2 good friends in the row 
 One second things is lookin' beautiful 
 The next second you can start off the funeral. 
 All my friends are in the dead end street 
 Some locked up and some are RIP 
 You can't win there ain't no way no how 
 Clock your change and get the fuck on out. 
 We was Pirex shakers 
 Sunny Side money makers 
 In Hillwood we had rocks big as now and laters 
 Quick snappers the store where we slung at 
 Everybody knew me for my hundred packs 
 Across the street was law elementry 
 My car was so clean kids was lookin' up to me 
 They wanna be like me a true hustla 
 'Cause they daddy drives an old gas guzzla 
 The dope dealer I ain't tryin' to brag 
 But fuck watchin' roaches tryin' to climb out of my bath tub 
 I was a hard head tryin' to be a drug lord 
 Slow my roll nah homey what the fuck for 
 I'm in the 2 bed trailor man I'm dirt poor 
 When hurricanes would come I'd run next door 
 To my homies house his name is Huet Hodges 
 We gonna make out this ghetto man I promise. 
 All my friends are in the dead end street 
 Some locked up and some are RIP 
 You can't win there ain't no way no how 
 Clock your change and get the fuck on out. 
 99% of all criminals and dope dealers 
 Get busted by bullets or fuckin' squealers 
 And the 1% that made it was pure luck 
 But even he'll tell that his life ain't worth a fuck 
 Cause in his mind he was caught a thousand times 
 And in his mind he was shot a thousand times 
 Without peace there can be no happyness 
 I wear a cross around my neck like the catholics 
 I'm not sure exaclty what my religion is 
 I just know I thank god for my little kids 
 This is the baddest sellin' drugs like some guinea pigs 
 Then they arrest us after we done make it big 
 They take our money our cars and our houses 
 Now tell me who's really sellin' the ounces 
 And any cash that we might have hidden 
 Goes to The System tryin' to stay out of prison. 
 All my friends are in the dead end street 
 Some locked up and some are RIP 
 You can't win there ain't no way no how 
 Clock your change and get the fuck on out. [x2]
