Ayana: 
 Think it's gonna be One Of Those Nights 
 One Of Those Nights again 
 Think it's gonna be One Of Those Nights smoked out with my friends. 
 South Park Mexican: 
 We from the H home boy 
 Hustle Town Texas 
 A.K.A Screwston, O's & X's 
 And you plexas leavin' in stretchers 
 Y'all ain't deep enough 
 You need to call up your extras 
 Hater hurter, the mic I'm a murder 
 Swanger & a swerver with a jar that say gurber 
 I ain't the biggest, I'm the baddest 
 Servin' dope addict's, bad temper, bad manners and bad habit's 
 It don't matter muthafucker, if you need it 
 I can send them to the valley pick 'm up and retrieve 
 m 
 Association by affiliation 
 About to hit 200 on the freeway when you see me racin'.

 Think it's gonna be One Of Those Nights 
 Hand on my Mack-10. 
 Uchie: 
 In the hiller, with my killer 
 Blowin' hogwa 
 See me comin' in the Benz or the Jaguar 
 And them niggas say 
 ch that's a bad car.'?Young gangsta but headin' like Haggler 
 And tell them money ain't the answer to your problem 
 Got the monkey on my back & I can't drop 
 m 
 In the city where the cop can get wiggy 
 Everybody do this to the piggy 
 If you want to sip one the remy 
 I appreciate the love that you give me 
 So tonight, I'm a chill and write lyrics 
 And smoke dro with my girl friends parents 
 Follow me!

 South Park Mexican: 
 I'm a Screwston sipper microphone ripper 
 I'm a come home with my shirt full of glitter 
 Jump my 45er 
 Race car driver 
 Smoke so much kill I got no more saliver 
 Love for the South sider and the North sider 
 I might accidentally get you for your lighter 
 I'm a street fighter some don't like the boy that got more snow flake than Tony the Tiger 
 I'm a get a Viper. 
 Who wants the Benz? 
 I'm a represent S.U.C. & Dead Endz 
 Fall in the place 
 Fine hoes in my face 
 Peace to Engrando and the D H 
 Love for the East side 
 And the South West 
 Ecko on my chest 
 And I sit on the Guess 
 Packin' my pump 
 Pass me the blunt 
 Fuck goin' gold 
 I'm just tryin' to win the Cannibus cup 
 What???
