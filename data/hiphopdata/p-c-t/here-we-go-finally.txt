Eh!? Danger Money's in the building, 
 It's a P.C.T production, now... 
 I'm as old-school as the days when London's... 
 Police used to bruise n***** with truncheons, 
 Double-u dot MySpace dot com... 
 Slash Danger Money Records, 
 Wild out n*****, wild out n*****, 
 Wild out n*****, right out from the... 
 Darkness I came like the train from the tunnel but with... 
 A bang like the b***** that came from the g**, blood, 
 Time is money, spend it wisely, why... 
 Waste it when you could be making more? I've got... 
 Stars in my eyes, I walk through the smoke into... 
 Fights with the devil I ain't no joke, 'cause... 
 Life's pretty enough to make me laugh, pretty... 
 As my hands after an hour in the bath, from... 
 B******* the law for extra cash, to... 
 Police cells rejecting bangers and mash, 
 Racists hate us, f*** 'em all the more for it, 
 Get 'em in a headlock, better yet, off with... 
 It takes a true 'G' to change a chance to a... 
 Change for the better for the good of the game they call... 
 Hip-Hop, not, for the good of the lames, well the... 
 Fact remains that this ain't a game, so... 
 Here we go, now, listen up, lady... 
 This is the part where you start to go crazy, 
 Here we go, now, listen up rudeboy... 
 This is the part where you wild out like you never... 
 Did before, time to settle the score, they... 
 Shut me out, till I kicked in the door, now... 
 It's time to show how the f*** we roll, so... 
 F*** what anyone thinks, here we go! 
 Home's where the heart is, Rome never started... 
 To be built before finishing on the same day, 
 Faith is a must, I say, f*** the nay-sayers, 
 A prayer a day means more than the papers, 
 D.Js, radio bosses, magazines... 
 TV channels, one thing the streets need's... 
 For us to hook up and follow the pillars of... 
 Light that shine from the truest truth, now the... 
 Sun may shine, but the cold still bites the... 
 Hand of every man in the land without gloves, a... 
 Life without love's the most terrible thing any... 
 Tongue could ever taste, the most terrible burden a... 
 Heart could ever bear, the most terrible sound an... 
 Ear could ever hear, the most terrible vision an... 
 Eye or a mind could ever bear witness, to my... 
 Falling out of lust, with a vengeance! 
 From Holloway to Guantanamo Bay, I'm a... 
 Law unto myself, I refuse to obey many... 
 Laws of the land, any law of the man worth... 
 B*******, I take any risk or Mick or... 
 P*** worth taking for the sake of my fate, 'cause... 
 Patrick Bateman's back on the loose, to turn... 
 Every advantage back to a deuce, baby... 
 Girl I'm thirsty, could you grab me a juice? Now... 
 I ain't about that bird-brained bubblegum... 
 Pop-Tart half-assed copycat weak s***, 
 A-B-C-D nursery-rhyme boring... 
 Pay a D.J to play it sweet s***, 
 'Cause, I'm about that Danger Money gully s***, 
 Deeper than a case given to Mulder and Scully s***, 
 F*** the rules, f*** the book, pay attention... 
 Spit on any beat 'cause I do it for the streets, and my... 
 Heart and my fate's in the hands of Jesus, 
 God blessed me with a big p****, the brain of a... 
 Genius, a pain that gave me a reason to... 
 Find something to believe in, I'm here to... 
 Stay I ain't leaving, like it, or lump it, 
 Jump on my d*** or s*** it, I ain't budging un... 
 Till I kick the bucket, so don't go against... 
 But go with me, yes, you can do it! 
 Eh! Finsbury Park, I've got you... 
 Eh! North London, I've got you... 
 Eh! All of London, I've got you... 
 Eh! The whole U.K, I've got you... 
 Eh! All of America, I've got you... 
 Eh! Worldwide, I've got you... 
 Eh! Street n*****, I've got you... 
 Eh! Gully D.Js, I've got you!
