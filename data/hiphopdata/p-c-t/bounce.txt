The time has come... 
 To boldly go... 
 To infinity, where to... 
 Overcome every fear we have to go, so... 
 Yet further we venture... 
 Into the unknown... 
 Because we know... 
 There is no place like home... 
 Ten, nine, eight, seven 
 Six, five, four, three, 
 Two, one... we have lift-off... 
 I'm a changed man, it's a new day I've... 
 Got a new gameplan for the countdown to... 
 Doomsday, every cliche feels like a teethache... 
 Thirty-two times worse than the worse toothache... 
 You ever felt on a total eclipse Tuesday, a... 
 Dynamite Monday or suicide Sunday, what... 
 You don't get yet you're gonna get someday, 
 Somehow, some way if you can imagine yourself... 
 Stood on the shoulders of giants in the hands of the... 
 Gods, in the land of nod, after forty... 
 Winks, 'n' in a scene so serene you would never... 
 Believe it "You know Victor Meldrew? He don't... 
 Believe It"! I assure you, more is less than an... 
 Open door to the core of the source of us... 
 All, for one 'n' all are by one for free, how's... 
 That for generosity within a monstrosity? 
 Bounce, come on, bounce, bounce, 
 Cause it's that time again, you better... 
 Bounce, bounce, come on, bounce, 
 'Cause it's that time again, I said... 
 Bounce, come on, come on, bounce, 
 'Cause it's that time again, to get a... 
 Bit more bounce to the ounce, I'm announcing... 
 This is the anthem for everyone bouncing! 
 Bounce... bounce, come on, 
 Bounce, you better bounce... come on, 
 Bounce... bounce, come on, 
 Bounce, you better bounce... bou - bou-... 
 Bounce, come on, ... bou - bou - bou... 
 Bounce... bounce... Brr - 
 ... Ounce, bounce, you better keep bouncing, the... 
 Rhythm'll disappear if you ever stop bouncing! 
 Miss, what are you pushing out your chest for? You... 
 Queen with the biggest ego on the chessboard, 
 Despite what you think, the reason we sex raw as a... 
 Human race is to push us ahead more! 
 Forget what the rest say for why they say it's all a... 
 Game, don't play it with 'em, they're like a pair of... 
 'Larry-The-Loafers' turned 'Gordon-The-Gophers', I... 
 Don't care, they're as real as Roy Of the Rovers, with a... 
 Head shaped like a poorly drawn Homer's - if they... 
 Go to jail they'll be renamed Ben Dover, 'n'... 
 In you is a beauty I can't define, I mean a... 
 Beauty this close to blowing my mind, I mean a... 
 Beauty powerful enough to sever the line... 
 Dividing the 'haves' from the 'have-nots' in a matter of... 
 Time. You 'n' I should go for a ride, upon the... 
 Rocket in my pocket, just you 'n' I, I wanna... 
 3-D vision on an infinite-D... 
 Mission'll do you as much good as a rubber chicken, 'n'... 
 If you ever pray you might wanna meditate, the... 
 Minute you stop falling you start to levitate! Soon as... 
 You become secure in yourself you never hate, 'n'... 
 Forever move forward for time'll never wait... 
 Time waits for none, forget the Joneses... 
 Keep up with the times or you're on your ownses... 
 Indiana Joneses, crystal skull owners... 
 Cracking a whip as we see fit is a bonus! 
 March to the beat of your own drum, as if the whole... 
 World never wanted you to know you own one! 
 I spy, with my little eye, a... 
 Femme fatale, one who is on the prowl, she has... 
 Me in her sights, she's got her claws out, she's... 
 Ready to pounce on me! I better bounce, b-b-b... 
 Guess who are the new champions..? 
 So are the champions new? Yeah! We're the... 
 Super future champions... 
 Super future new year! 
 Oh well, sorry old champions... 
 Are we sorry that you're old news? Yeah! Well the... 
 Super future champions... 
 Wish you a super new year!
