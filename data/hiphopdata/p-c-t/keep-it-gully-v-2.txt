Eh!? Danger Money's in the building, 
 It's P.C.T on a Mikey... 
 J co-production, it's the sequel, chapter... 
 Two in the saga, where it gets harder... 
 Yeah, that's a breath of fresh air, that's a blast from the... 
 Past, ask the hood, it's the beat of the year, and this... 
 Ain't a placebo, this is musical heroin my hustle... 
 Has evolved, almost as much as the flow, so... 
 Sit back, relax, enjoy the high, and let your... 
 Friends know about your new source of supply. Some... 
 Say some things are too good to be true, but I... 
 Say some things are just so good, that we... 
 Struggle to believe it when they happen to us, 
 cause the... 
 World's taught us how to forget to keep the faith. 
 And ever since Hurricane Katrina, I've got to... 
 Say I've been a bit safer in the knowledge I've... 
 Acquired over the years I've spent growing over the... 
 Years, and getting over the tears, I've got a lot going... 
 On in my brain... words'd never explain, and there... 
 Ain't enough time to justify trying and... 
 We [We] Just [Just] Don't [Don't] Give [Give]... 
 A [A] F*** 
 Cause... We Keep It Gully [Gully], 
 This [This] Is [Is] How [How] We [We]... 
 Have [Have] Fun Blood... We Keep It Gully [Gully]. 
 We [We] Just [Just] Don't [Don't] Give [Give]... 
 A [A] F*** Bruv... We Keep It Gully [Gully], 
 P.C.T... Danger Money's In The Building, 
 Wherever You're From, Just Keep It Gully [Gully]! 
 I'm just trying to better myself, I'm trying to be a role... 
 Model for all my youngers as well as myself. I've come a... 
 Long way from a day when suicide ran through my mind at a time it tried to run... 
 Riot... but I'd never try it, but keep it quiet... that's between you and I. I'm a... 
 Loose cannon with a lit fuse girl, so if we hook up... 
 Then it's you and me against the world... because... 
 S*** ain't pretty in this great city, I'm... 
 Engrossed in the game... baby, play it with me. it... 
 Ain't about where you're from... 
 cause it's a bit too... 
 Busy being all about where you're at, whilst... 
 Learning to be about where you're going... sure as the... 
 Hunger for more keeps me going and flowing for... 
 Sure... forevermore... it's a new beginning, f***... 
 Dying... try living, f*** lying... try... 
 Giving, better yet, f*** winning, try trying! You... 
 Can't win 'em all, but we give it our all because... 
 From the Pyramids... to the West... the stage is... 
 Set... and it all comes to a head at the dawn of the... 
 Dead, when the sun goes down on the New World... 
 Order at Armageddon... that's what the doctor... 
 Ordered... Jesus Christ of Nazareth... the... 
 Only way's up... which way are we headed? Every... 
 Snake's headed for the snake pit, hell shalt hath... 
 The fury for as long as they're willing to take it. And I... 
 Don't know s*** about ice, but I know about... 
 N***** with a grudge jeopardizing my life... as if I... 
 Ain't got enough on my plate... I'm in pretty good... 
 Shape, but a great many want me to lose weight! 
 Real recognizes real, 
 cause real is... 
 Truthfully truthful as I truthfully feel... 
 Because I live a double... no a triple... better yet a... 
 Quadruple life, and my n***** are in the same boat!
