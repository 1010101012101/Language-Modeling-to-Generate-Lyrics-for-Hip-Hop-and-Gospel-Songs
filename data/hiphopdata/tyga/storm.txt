The city's current electricity 
 No lights so I can hardly see 
 And all despite, screaming rescue me, rescue me 
 Who to trust in can you believe 
 The devil owns this reality 
 And all despite, screaming rescue me, rescue me STORM 
 Uh, Hate lies never truth when it's televised 
 Devils on the screen, fire in their eyes 
 Put your face to a spell make your soul fly 
 Pray everyday, some pray for God 
 Looking at the murder rate never ask why 
 Colt 45, where the four five 
 The innocent die young, can't judge life 
 Never did, so I live fast every night 
 Wonder why they breathe hate through their windpipes 
 Mu fuckas wanna take it 'stead of give advise 
 Niggaz left me, now I'm living right 
 Tryna cheat death with the trick dice 
 Gammon leg, camel lie, u on management [?] 
 If it's about business, I'm a handle it 
 I see it all like an analyst 
 Views of the water big bills like a pelican 
 How many different broads fucking in foreign cars 
 Was it a asus 10 color benz I ain't got a heart 
 No lust, hit the cupid with a dark ninja in the park Ma fucka don't walk past dark 
 What the fuck is Illumanti 
 Old niggas with money 
 Bitch get the power like 
 Stand tall towers like 
 Gotta fight, can't let them 
 Take our life 
 The city's current electricity 
 No lights so I can hardly see 
 And all despite, screaming rescue me, rescue me 
 Who you trust in can you believe 
 The devil owns this reality 
 And all despite, screaming rescue me, rescue me STORM 
 Take a step as the world spin 
 Rumors come and go faster than a whirlwind 
 World pro bitches all gettin' sucked in 
 Booty model shake your ass but you're broke bitch 
 Man you niggaz ain't brawling in the bull pin 
 Riding on the black mag, I'm a cool kid 
 Last 10 lemme get space like a movement 
 Cream get the money went icey like cool whip 
 Bullshit who shit nigga art galley flow 
 Pen and under globe 
 Use the color tho 
 Nigga I'm a lone 
 Levitator pro 
 Christ when he spoke 
 Kicking in your door 
 Hit the floor like Lee Boy with a globe 
 Tryna win but the finish line far 
 Race against the odds 
 Race don't matter when you dead or start Praying to the Gods 
 Don't let me die so young 
 The city's current electricity 
 No lights so I can hardly see 
 And all despite, screaming rescue me, rescue me 
 Who to blame 
 Who will pay 
 Like grins [?] 
 On our faces 
 Like the stars 
 You will fall [?] 
 With your back 
 To the earth 
 Storm
