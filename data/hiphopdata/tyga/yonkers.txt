I'm Well Done 
 I'm Well Done 
 Fuckin' Ric Flair leglock 
 Headshot, body cropped, make his fuckin' mama watch 
 Squeeze your baby inside a fuckin' baby bottle pop 
 Risky top, running through your blood till your kidneys pop 
 Pillow-talk, leave your lips on top of your pillowtop 
 Pop you while your roof off, on top of a rooftop 
 Oswald, Mankind, all you niggas getting socked 
 ? Rock it till your burger leave the lettuce out 
 Check this out, no one around 
 Put your faces on my crotch 
 Give a lick, lollipop, frog-tongue on my cock 
 All well done 
 All well done 
 All well done 
 All well done 
 There's mammals in my living room 
 Louis minks, foxtails, doper than the metal spoon 
 Ay fool, split your enchilada, now it's worm food 
 Moving like worms move, burn ya like perms do 
 One two, leader of the Rat Pack crew 
 Hat removed, when I walk in rooms, make her eyes twitch 
 Juke ya, cut your shit out like a coupon 
 In due time, reign of a new king 
 Well done 
 Well done 
 All well done 
 All well done 
 All well done 
 All well done
