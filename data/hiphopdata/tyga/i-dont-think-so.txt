I've been grniding since the day on 
 Now I'm over but my mama don't think so 
 Don't think so 
 My heart big better beat slow 
 Can't trust everybody you meet yo 
 That you can't meet yo 
 I trap this smile whole life 
 For you to take it I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 See that you ain't right 
 Trying to take my ride I don't so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 Naw I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 Naw I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 Some say I'm so arrogant 
 Talking about every girl and the old ones I hit 
 Look miss whoever told you this ain't him dismiss 
 No time for you small mind midgits 
 No offence to them but giantess 
 What's I'm looking like from short distance 
 Prolific write or touch the paper averageless 
 Nigga you heiriness 
 Nigga intentive in attendance 
 Listen checklist before the guestlist 
 More trying to enter but won't exit 
 'Cause I'm winexus 
 Every grandkid expect us 
 Tyga for they breakfast 
 Now they want seconds 
 They won't wait a second 
 Let me program 
 She obessed with my stylish ass 
 Just sit back and I laugh 
 All these clowns trying to pay with my cash 
 Something never had 
 But me 
 I've been grniding since the day on 
 Now I'm over but my mama don't think so 
 Don't think so 
 My heart big better beat slow 
 Can't trust everybody you meet yo 
 That you can't meet yo 
 I trap this smile whole life 
 For you to take it I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 See that you ain't right 
 Trying to take my ride I don't so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 Naw I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 Naw I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 So what's up is you down? 
 With us of course I'm just on my what if 
 Other shit id be getting without this 
 I don't need all these people 
 So I love with my eagle 
 Where mvpblo can't see you 
 Even if I try to those right beside you 
 Could be your misguidance for now I say goodbye boo 
 Maybe later down the line we could be cool 
 Vibe like the magazine do a movie or two 
 Review my latest news interviews you too 
 Like how many views? you sold just like me 
 Between worlds it's a lighting 
 How you become perfect timing 
 From far north to the islands 
 Gde they talking 
 But watch 'em 
 Misery loves company 
 It's getting crowded 
 I've been grniding since the day on 
 Now I'm over but my mama don't think so 
 Don't think so 
 My heart big better beat slow 
 Can't trust everybody you meet yo 
 That you can't meet yo 
 I trap this smile whole life 
 For you to take it I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 See that you ain't right 
 Trying to take my ride I don't so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 Naw I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 Naw I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 (Chorus/outro: tyga talking in background) 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so 
 I don't think so
