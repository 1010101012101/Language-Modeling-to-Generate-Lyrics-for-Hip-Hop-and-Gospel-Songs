Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up 
 Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up 
 Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up 
 Twist it all up 
 Twist it all up 
 Everybody in the party 
 Hold your cup high move your body 
 If you twist it scream it loudly! 
 Ay, ay, ay, hey, ay, ay, ay, hey 
 Coconut juice got me real loose 
 Like, got me leaning three thousand proof like 
 Coconut juice all on the dance floor 
 Fellas let your ladies go ladies let your fellas go 
 Come back, went straight to the club 
 Entrance no charge 'cause we late to the club 
 Uumm yes, we'll stand in the club 
 GED on the couch pouring drinks on the rug 
 What a mess, but we cleanin' the club 
 Ice so bright make a fight scene in the club 
 Don't test, 'cause their beams in the club 
 Red beams in the club leave your jeans full of blood 
 Coconut juice got me real loose 
 Like, got me leaning three thousand proof like 
 Coconut juice all on the dance floor 
 Fellas let your ladies go ladies let your fellas go 
 Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up 
 Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up 
 Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up 
 Twist it all up 
 Twist it all up

 And he said, I'm getting every dollar on GED 
 VI, important person, raps most important person 
 So coat it, an I'm up in this thing with my thing 
 An she shaking that thing her momma gave her. 
 Coconut juice got me real loose 
 Like, got me leaning three thousand proof like 
 Coconut juice all on the dance floor 
 Fellas let your ladies go ladies let your fellas go 
 Put the lime in the coconut and twist it all up

 Whether you knotty-dreaded or you crazy bald head 
 Jump up if you love it no guns in this place 
 So what he's my cousin sexy runs in the family 
 Coconut juice got me real loose
