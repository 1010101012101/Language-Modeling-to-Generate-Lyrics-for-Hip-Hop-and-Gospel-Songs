(Tyga talking) 
 Open your eyes eyes in the dark dark... 
 Clear your mind mind clear your heart heart... 
 To the skies skies and beyond yond... 
 You are now listening to black thoughts... 
 Open your eyes eyes in the dark dark... 
 Clear your mind mind clear your heart heart... 
 To the skies skies and beyond yond... 
 You are now listening to black thoughts... 
 Thoughts 
 Uh middle finger fuck your lights 
 Look in the mirror see your image twice 
 They turn my fog on stage lights 
 What's about to go on? on me tonight 
 Hoe sight to see them lifesize 
 Niggas hating on it bet that niggas close by 
 Echoethe lullabys sing at your funeral 
 Send his momma the bills 
 I'm reading my fanmail 
 We be aiming bitches on my handheld 
 So sick of lyrically murdering tracks roadkill 
 So I'll wear fur like frank bear 
 Tel-tell herlick my dick 
 Like powder blue kiss 
 Who knew this kid 
 Blow up to be this big 
 Pulling up in benz looking at my crib 
 My twitpic but no camera lens 
 I live in the moment sound reminence 
 Bitch 
 Open your eyes eyes in the dark dark... 
 Clear your mind mind clear your heart heart... 
 To the skies skies and beyond yond... 
 You are now listening to black thoughts... 
 Open your eyes eyes in the dark dark... 
 Clear your mind mind clear your heart heart... 
 To the skies skies and beyond yond... 
 You are now listening to black thoughts...
