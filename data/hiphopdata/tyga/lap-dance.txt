Benzo, batman, big hoe, lap dance 
 Ass so fat need a lap dance 
 Ass so fat I need a lap dance 
 Benzo, batman, big hoe, lap dance 
 Ass so fat need a lap dance 
 Ass so fat I need a lap dance 
 (Tyga - Verse 1) 
 Shit straight killer, Max Payne, Travis Porter, make it rain 
 Young Money gang, put you on the team 
 All my bitches fly, put you on a plane 
 Hundreds in your face, why you broke boy? 
 Not from Chi city but I make the Illinois 
 Let your pride gone walk it out 
 In the bank and I'm only cashing large amounts 
 One, one, two, two bitch what it do? three, four, drop it to the floor 
 Five, five, six, six, rubber on the? 
 Seven, seven, eight, eight, make that ass shake 
 Benzo, batman, thick hoe, lap dance 
 Ass so fat need a lap dance 
 Ass so fat I need a lap dance 
 Benzo, batman, big hoe, lap dance 
 Ass so fat need a lap dance 
 Ass so fat I need a lap dance 
 (Tyga - Verse 2) 
 It's raining ass and titties, yeah, ass and titties 
 If you ain't throwing money, mind your f-cking business 
 Floss like a dentist, Dennis the menace 
 Room of crazy n-ggas, probably get a life sentence 
 Sharper than a tac, attack and bite you bitches 
 Swagga jack and biting on like you n-ggas 
 Like conscious rappers, mad 'cause we winning 
 Snug long nose call it Scottie Pippen 
 Ah, got like 200k large, in the back seat of my car 
 Like Cialis I go hard, motherf-cker 
 One, one, two, two bitch what it do? three, four, drop it to the floor 
 Five, five, six, six, rubber on the? 
 Seven, seven, eight, eight, make that ass shake 
 Make it, make it, make it clap 
 Make it, make it, make it clap 
 Make it, make it, make it clap 
 Make it, make it, make it clap 
 One, one, two, two bitch what it do? three, four, drop it to the floor 
 Five, five, six, six, rubber on the? 
 Seven, seven, eight, eight, make that ass shake
