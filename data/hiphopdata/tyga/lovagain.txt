Know we fall in love again 
 Know we fall in love again 
 Know we fall in love again 
 Know we fall in love again 
 Yo, Everybody got a story 
 But this is mine. 
 I think I started somethin', 
 New chick, just started fuckin'. 
 Kinda early, but I know we both love it. 
 We both rushin, we could add titles. 
 But then we both cuffin. 
 Rollin' in the sheets till midnight, moanin. 
 I'mma go down south then call the 
 Pussy pink like a lotus. 
 I'mma eat it good like somethin' outta Lawrys. 
 Oh... 
 All good like a summer day. 
 Blowin' out the cake, blowin' Novacane. 
 She really shouldn't, 
 But she prone to that lifestyle. 
 THC, ecstasy, in the white cells. 
 Can you hear me now? 
 Can you hear me now (baby pick up) 
 Heard she with some niggas ball players playin' pick up. 
 My pretty little princess, now she is promiscuous. 
 Supposed to be my princess, 
 Out here fuckin' niggas. 
 I ain't trippin', Imma get another bitch. 
 I don't mean this shit 
 It's too hard to end this shit 
 I rather stay then call it quits 
 I know we fall in love again 
 Know we fall in love again 
 Real nigga got hoes on my dick 
 Couldn't see them, love had my eyes closed 
 Now I see them, ain't nothing worth it though 
 Rather be with you than out here a lonely soul 
 On the road entertainin hoes. 
 Bitches I don't know tweetin from their camera phones 
 Man this shit gettin' old 
 I just hope we still involved 
 I just hope we still involved.
