It's getting real tonight, you ain't the only bitch on my mind 
 I can make you feel all right, but I ain't gonna fuss a fight 
 Every girl I see I like, so why wanna waste your time? 
 You know the deal uh? I'm right 
 Ya I'm for real love, I'm right, it's gettin' real tonight 
 My time ticker on tres, fucking all night, midnight sex 
 She ride like my old bitch, but she already knew that 
 She feel me even when I'm gone, pillows between her legs, now she comfortable 
 Extend your back vovo, volcano when the shit explode, boom 
 Picture me tied down for life, I flash too bright, picture won't look right 
 I need god advice dealing with these lady mice 
 Girls like planes enter the next flight 
 It's getting real tonight, you ain't the only bitch on my mind 
 I can make you feel all right, but I ain't gonna fuss a fight 
 Every girl I see I like, so why wanna waste your time? 
 You know the deal uh? I'm right 
 Ya I'm for real love, I'm right, it's gettin' real tonight 
 Iphone just filled with hoes, conversation goes, back and forth 
 What you doing? chilling like eskimos? 
 Bet I eat your pussy good like vegetables 
 Nasty, nigger but you like it though 
 Freaky ass scorpio she ride me like carnivos 
 And I'm horny though, sex in the morning though 
 Hormones got my snowboard going verticle 
 Vertigo, dizzy on my love boat, heard she got a party mouth 
 Wash ya ass out with soap 
 Damn we fuck again, she ain't my lover, we just cudi budi friends 
 It's getting real tonight, you ain't the only bitch on my mind 
 I can make you feel all right, but I ain't gonna fuss a fight 
 Every girl I see I like, so why wanna waste your time? 
 You know the deal uh? I'm right 
 Ya I'm for real love, I'm right, it's gettin' real tonight
