(Feat. Gata) 
 G E D prepare for launch 
 In 3... 2... 1... 
 Welcomin' Tyga man from mars 
 Possible most popular star 
 VÃ¡monos he's getting to far 
 Make a wish now and draw your card 
 Hello miss space diva in the yellow 
 I see you see I'm dream fellow 
 Stay puff for me like pillows 
 Marshmallows and a goal that's my flow 
 I'm winnin' the prize for the deadest man alive 
 Cause my brains on a page that the author didn't wright 
 But they ain't using my name, leave nothing in your vein 
 So take it from me safety's on, your lane 
 Put your safety's on, get ready for a change 
 And this right here, this heres no range 
 For Christ sake look around it's space 
 Pick a place let's move in today 
 I'll take you on a ride 
 Just step inside 
 Look around you hear the sound 
 But close your eyes 
 Imagine your not alive 
 Feel free to fly 
 Lift off the mission oh so go in time 
 So so shorty is you vibin' 
 Oh oh oh you like shinin' 
 Well well I can buy you diamonds 
 Think about it naw shorty I'm lyin' 
 Don't don't get to excited 
 That's the beat and I'm just rhymin' 
 Me so officially but no license 
 I guess we space joyridin' 
 GATA: 
 Look 
 Ok buckle up buckle up time to take off 
 Put the a.c. on let it blow your face off 
 Where we goin' I don't know 
 But I guarantee you never been before 
 So sit back 
 And let me guide ya guide ya 
 'Cause I'm not like the dudes that ya used to buyin' 
 F L Y that's what I am 
 But you are my top pick, you the pilot 
 Under my wings 'cause I doin' my thing 
 On the TV yeah on the scene 
 It's hard to believe that I'm livin' a dream 
 Blinded by the lights and all this bling 
 Now heres your choice you can stay or leave 
 But make your mind up before the times up 
 Your too late and why I can't state 
 I'll take you on a ride 
 Just step inside 
 Look around you hear the sound 
 But close your eyes 
 Imagine your not alive 
 Feel free to fly 
 Lift off the mission oh so go in time
