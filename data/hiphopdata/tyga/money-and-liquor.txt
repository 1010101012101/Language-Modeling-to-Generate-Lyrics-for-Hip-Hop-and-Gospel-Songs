It's that young beasty nigga 
 Brrr-hah stick em 
 It's still no fitteds, Dupont finish 
 Courtside tickets, ? 
 Purple like Grimace 
 Roof pop like titties 
 Pound sign - sit your ass down, bitch, I'm busy 
 I'm balling like a bitch - all-blue Ken Griffies 
 Use the chicken rotisserie, squeeze the ? to your lemon 
 Everything I do new, nigga, cut the red ribbon 
 Give me space to the left 
 Leave your face indented 
 There's too many women, why this niggas out there starin'? 
 Raw Mclaren, boy flier than a parrot 
 Me and that money got a merit 
 I was the first to pop her cherry 
 Now it's big living, fast cars, model women 
 Penthouse, hella-chains 
 Why you trippin'? 
 Money and Liquor 
 Money and Liquor 
 Type of nigga 
 Gold sofas, gold bottles, gold women 
 Gold grills, gold rings - why you trippin'? 
 Money and Liquor 
 Money and Liquor 
 Young Gudda nigga 
 Stay young Gudda nigga 
 Fuck them other niggas 
 Stumbling from the liquor 
 Throwing money at the strippers 
 Promethazine mixer, Codeine sipper 
 Ring on my pinky looking like the Big Dipper 
 Money talks, we speak often 
 Murking the beat, we gon need a coffin 
 Got a freak riding shotgun 
 She rolling hard on the pink dolphin 
 Young nigga, but the money is old 
 Big estates, the money don't fold 
 Jewelry box full of colorful shit, but 
 Everything on my neck is gold 
 Get in it, let's finish it 
 You talk shit, I live this shit 
 She love a nigga to death, so when I'm 
 In the pussy, I kill the shit 
 Money flowing like a river 
 I buy the bar out, I mix the money with the liquor 
 Nigga! 
 Now it's big living, fast cars, model women 
 Penthouse, hella-chains - why you trippin'? 
 Money and Liquor 
 Money and Liquor 
 Type of nigga 
 Gold sofas, gold bottles, gold women 
 Gold grills, gold rings - why you trippin'? 
 Money and Liquor 
 Money and Liquor 
 Young Gudda nigga
