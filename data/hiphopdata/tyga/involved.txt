What happens when you get involved? 
 N-ggas start telling lies (start telling lies) 
 Both wanna be involved 
 But loves like suicide 
 Now that your too involved 
 Infatuated to the high 
 (Tyga - Verse 1) 
 Uh took a deep breath, Inhaled this love in the air 
 Only just to find pain 'cause it's all that I feel 
 Mothaf-ckas say they real, but they really ain't for real 
 I'll show you who's real, when you broke ain't a thrill 
 Got bills waiting on me, and its drama in my ear 
 I wanna sit still, but I'm busy tryna live 
 Forgiving all my sins, crucifixed now I'm fixed 
 Road to eternal bliss 
 Now they hate me like Chris, Rock on my arm 
 Gotta keep a piece of mine, hot cherry balm, lip locking with a dime 
 I make bitches scream for me like I'm Lil Jon 
 Last king to flow, sweeter then a bon bon 
 Quick sand bitches running out of time 
 Got my shades on, I ain't waiting in the line 
 Whatever it is I'm on some better shit 
 All black barreta shit 
 Leather coat, leather mitts 
 I don't leave no finger prints, Eddie raw, semi clips 
 Violence ain't for little kids 
 But I keep something cause these n-ggas wanna test me 
 N-ggas on that ice like Gretzky 
 Montage chillin', life on a jet-ski 
 Haters left I like Leslie 
 N-gga ball hard, never been to the SB's 
 But now you walk alone, no holding hands 
 Just wishing somebody could understand 
 No father figure, taught myself to be a man 
 Mama said keep God in all your plans 
 Let the sun shine keep your head high 
 It's always people after your spot, gotta stay high, gotta stay high 
 Don't let it stop, then ask yourself why? 
 Last king n-gga ready for war, jeep threw off the doors 
 New paint now the car reborn, and I'm flying overseas 
 Now my dollars is foreign 
 And the Bentley got wings now the angels is calling 
 Uh The good son Macaulay Culkin 
 Getting money till my last show 
 Word up to Oprah, the whips pull out like a leather sofa 
 Coolest n-gga couldn't hang with me like Mr.cooper 
 Super duper, need a pooper scooper 
 I'm the shit clean it in the white loofer 
 It's Young Mula hustle like an oompa loompa 
 Young tutor teach you n-ggas how to do this 
 Shame on a hater, we don't pop charts, so the bread pop up like pop tarts 
 Red coupe, hot sauce, bitches getting locked jaw 
 Big titties top off, ass like sasquatch 
 The rap star, highlights, player of the week, gotta get five mics 
 Clever when I speak, motivation for your life 
 They under-rating me, Mike verses A.I., 
 But I'ma get mine mothaf-cka, sh-shootem in the line mothaf-cka 
 Like hi mothaf-cka, head light from trucka, like dear to a hunter 
 I'm aiming at something!
