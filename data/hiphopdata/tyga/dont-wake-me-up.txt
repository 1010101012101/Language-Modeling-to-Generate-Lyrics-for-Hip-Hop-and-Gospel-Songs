MBN's in my trouble bag... what a first class destination France 
 Fascinated by my watch hypnotic trance we're on a jets coat skin 
 With exotic fish, I like a fresh seat on my play 
 Cruel ship 'cause the dollar levitate yours like a CNP 
 Slower than a... face pop shake... dance move your body like a snake 
 Is so Gucci when dollars is flowing poor... bitches... living in a moment 
 Tell your mother you're good, I'm a rap star... pay the hood 
 Took the top of back... back car, back man scarf 
 Bruce... in a flash mister out front house guess... bad with the ginnie... 
 Always... when you don't give a fuck. 
 So don't wake nigga up, don't wake nigga up, 
 Mother fucker I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming. 
 Don't wake nigga up, don't wake nigga up, 
 Mother fucker I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming. 
 ... Waking up in Vegas 
 Some girls look like Katy Perry said we have... naked 
 The hangover can't remember should we barely made it 
 House keep... for the... tight... penthouse guess level 
 We all got sweets niggas all... 
 Turn the jazz on said she 32 but she like 'em young 
 Real milf she blow me like bubble yum 
 ... Don't spit nigga... done 
 Ten minutes... beating like a drum 
 We all getting late tonight it's a... night 
 When... over time, prime time on your... light 
 Why MCMB that's Tyga... 
 Last king covered in gold, you see me... so nigga don't 
 Don't wake nigga up, don't wake nigga up, 
 Mother fucker I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming. 
 Don't wake nigga up, don't wake nigga up, 
 Mother fucker I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming.
