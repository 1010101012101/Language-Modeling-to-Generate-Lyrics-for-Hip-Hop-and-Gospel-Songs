I mean, I've been doing some thinking, you know? 
 We only teenagers, but I do love you. But, I think we gotta move on. 
 Don't cry though. 
 Listen, it's just teenage love baby. 
 When I'm alone, all I'm thinking about is my girl. 
 Your smile, your pretty face and them light brown curls. 
 At first I was playing and saying cause love is a horrible thing to waste, went straight to it. 
 (Uh) Didn't have to take what it is. 
 I'm Tyga, my friends they call me flyer then your ex man. 
 Had this flyer. I'm just being honest. 
 I am more then what you could find in cereal boxes. 
 Be my goddess, higher then this world, I could take your body. 
 Probably, being a man is not an option. 
 It's my hobby, so you holding my hand is what other girls is watching. 
 Pics of your prince in your locker, put this lipgloss on and get the haters popping lil ma. 
 Teenage love, (teenage love) teenage love (teenage love), teenage love (it's the teenage love) 
 Don't, don't, don't hurt me again. 
 Teenage love (it's the teenage love), teenage love (it's the teenage love), teenage love (it's the teenage love) 
 Don't, don't, don't hurt me again. 
 You call up the studio, I said about another hour. 
 But you refused to hear it saying baby do you miss me. (I do) 
 But my intentions was playing this song when I visit you. 
 Screaming our conversation, everybody trying to listen. 
 But we only young, infatuated, sprung, or in lust. 
 I think I'm all the above, two teenagers above. 
 I gave up them girls, you gave up the club, I gave you everything you wanted just because. 
 I was waiting for cupid to come shooting arrows through my heart. 
 Now you want to be apart, what you mean you finished? 
 We're only at the start, I ain't leaving girl, we come oh so far. 
 Teenage love, (teenage love) teenage love (teenage love), teenage love (it's the teenage love) 
 Don't, don't, don't hurt me again. 
 Teenage love (it's the teenage love), teenage love (it's the teenage love), teenage love (it's the teenage love) 
 Don't, don't, don't hurt me again. 
 Let's not pimp it, it's too risky, I don't get it. 
 I'm feeling dizzy, the room spinning. 
 You gotta be kidding, my teenage misses you leave now, my life is ended. 
 (Damn, damn) My life has ended. (My life has ended) 
 The teenage love, it's the teenage love, teenage love, it's the teenage love. 
 Don't, don't, don't hurt me again. 
 Teenage love, it's the teenage love. Teenage love, it's the teenage love. 
 Teenage love, it's the teenage love (teenage love) 
 Don't, don't, don't hurt me again. 
 Teenage love, (teenage love) teenage love (teenage love), teenage love (it's the teenage love) 
 Don't, don't, don't hurt me again. 
 Teenage love (it's the teenage love), teenage love (it's the teenage love), teenage love (it's the teenage love) 
 Don't, don't, don't hurt me again. 
 Don't hurt me again, don't hurt me again. (Big Evil) 
 Don't hurt me again, don't hurt me again. 
 Don't, don't, don't hurt me again. 
 Don't hurt me again, don't hurt me again. (GD) 
 Don't hurt me again, don't, don't, don't hurt me again. 
 Tyga!
