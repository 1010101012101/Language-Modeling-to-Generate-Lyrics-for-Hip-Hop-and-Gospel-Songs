(Chorus: Patty Crash) 
 Diamond life 
 Sugar baby we dynamite 
 Playboy and socialites 
 Young and fly fly fly 
 (Verse 1: Tyga) 
 1989 no pressure 
 But to be the bestest in my section 
 Levels of a professional 
 Skip school create my own lessons 
 Confessions of a mad rapper 
 Music got me rapping 
 Green stretching only leads to red stretches 
 He's next in line for the blessing 
 Get your mind off minds 
 Hustle something and stop relying on mine 
 More then a legend why you letting time fly by 
 At age 17 addicted to ink 
 A rap feign who had money dreams 
 My chase of fame couldn't compare to what I seen 
 Them die government lie hard for the paper cheese 
 Mom's crying watching her only son 
 Through TV MTV bet 
 He on now wipe me down 
 No longer fighting through the crowd 
 I control the crowd oh you like me now wow! 
 (Chorus: Patty Crash) 
 Diamond life 
 Sugar baby we dynamite 
 Playboy and socialites 
 Young and fly fly fly 
 Diamond life 
 Sugar baby we dynamite 
 Playboy and socialites 
 Young and fly fly fly 
 Back to the cool motivational roads 
 No guidance just violence in probational homes 
 Thinking my high routes is all out 
 Music gotta be my way out 
 Family gathered around I gotta make 'em proud 
 Pops popped in the penatenary laided out 
 Hoping his son fell under a different cloud 
 I'm speaking directly into the crowd 
 Nothing personal 
 Just thought you would love to know the person 
 Far from perfect 
 But nearly word perfect 
 Must be he weighed him 
 On a scale from one to me, me 
 Even the greatness 
 Money equal an every ten haters 
 The rest couldn't make it though the unlikely behavior 
 So be patient 
 Or end up the next patient 
 Emergency room, newspaper 
 The new rappers call 'em street actors 
 Music wise they playing safety 
 And I'm shooting on safety aiming for greatness 
 (Chorus: Patty Crash) 
 Diamond life 
 Sugar baby we dynamite 
 Playboy and socialites 
 Young and fly fly fly 
 Diamond life 
 Sugar baby we dynamite 
 Playboy and socialites 
 Young and fly fly fly fly 
 Now every body where you game face 
 Forget it everybody just do what he say 
 They wanna move like they wanna be like 
 You can do it just like like, like 
 Diamond life 
 Now every body where you game face 
 Forget it everybody just do what he say 
 They wanna move like they wanna be like 
 You can do it just like like, like 
 (Chorus: Patty Crash) 
 Diamond life 
 Sugar baby we dynamite 
 Playboy and socialites 
 Young and fly fly fly 
 Diamond life 
 Sugar baby we dynamite 
 Playboy and socialites 
 Young and fly fly fly fly (yeah yeah yeah yeah) 
 Cash staking like Tetris 
 It's youthful effervesces 
 No herme arsenals 
 I'm my only secret weapon 
 Get the message (got diamonds) 
 I'm getting cream like a nestle 
 Welcome from Compton getting
