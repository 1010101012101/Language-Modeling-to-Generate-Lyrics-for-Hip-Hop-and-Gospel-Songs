 Gettin' that money I've been waiting fo' 
 Ray Allen number, nothin' less than 20k a show 
 Used to wanna be a B-baller, now I ball without a coach 
 Heard she ain't fuckin', then she gotta go 
 I turn beast, Billy badass Geronimo 
 Call me young heart attack, you just give her minor strokes 
 Patty cake dick her down, then she row row her boat 
 Penetrated in her throat 
 Now she in a comatose 
 Been waitin' ages my nigga, kicked in the f-cken door 
 Had me in a Bullshit 
 Manifest I never did 
 Ever since bull color bruises shit 
 Send a killer kid, kill the stage on some thriller shit 
 Say she don't swallow on her knees 
 She goin' spit it out like a pile of seeds 
 I'm so nasty, fuck her in the back seat 
 Doggystyle lastly Mr. boombox sick 
 Fuck the law 
 I pop all y'all 
 For my family, my dawgs to my mother, bless her heart 
 I am her only son, and her son ain't far 
 Shinnin' I'm a star, nigga 
 Luminous charms 
 Just blew up, but I been a bomb 
 Boys tryna show up, get shitted on 
 I'm at the game courtside with my camos on 
 With a redbone, snap back 
 Gettin' lap dance while you gettin' laughed at 
 I swear that nigga dig a whole 
 Get ya barried track 
 And you've awaken the dead, the anti-Christ is back 
 I know you don't give a fuck about me 
 I swear I don't give a fuck about you 
 So I'm a get this money 
 And count it all day, while you muthaf-ckas say who dat!
