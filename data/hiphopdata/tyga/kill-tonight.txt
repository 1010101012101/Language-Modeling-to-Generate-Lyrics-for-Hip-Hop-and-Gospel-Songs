Feeling like some patron tonight 
 Yeah I just got my deal tonight tonight tonight 
 And them girls gonna howl for mike 
 Full moon so I'm gonna bite 
 That's all that's all 
 If I'm wrong don't steer me right 
 What I'm wearing can't pronounce the price 
 The price the price 
 Ride and drive can't dim the lights 
 So tell the sheriff I just kill tonight 
 Waking up the man every damn morning 
 A few honies left right money 
 But gets none from me 
 My days lovely 
 Similiar to rich clubbing 
 Only last memories these leftover hornets 
 My pockets some deposit 
 I rather plunge it you got it? 
 I ovedoes it I'm so redundent 
 Since it come so often why not offer 
 You want it work for it 
 Ain't no clyde cher and bonnies 
 Benz and harlies 
 Cali niggas riding 
 Outside fence 'em 
 How I look at shit I'm inside it 
 I take flights cause ain't no other option 
 Tell the pilot I'm flying 
 Yes I am... 
 Feeling like some patron tonight 
 Yeah I just got my deal tonight tonight tonight 
 And them girls gonna howl for mike 
 Full moon so I'm gonna bite 
 That's all that's all 
 If I'm wrong don't steer me right 
 What I'm wearing can't pronounce the price 
 The price the price 
 Ride and drive can't dim the lights 
 So tell the sheriff I just kill tonight 
 Tonight 
 Pick up my gd brothers 
 Chain colors 
 Yellow butter 
 Seats leather 
 Same shade as skin nigga 
 I feel parch really talk only big business 
 I approach even close my eyes see your vision 
 Collide with this collision 
 Conclusion your whole teams losing 
 You still be a nuesence I'm the new whiz 
 Old headset he keeps improving 
 New boosters now buy and bump to it 
 Damn it's midnight and I just realized 
 This time 05 I was lioving in what I drived in 
 Now I'm living in houses you could drive in 
 Buy freds come on now you know I'm just 
 Feeling like some patron tonight 
 Yeah I just got my deal tonight tonight tonight 
 And them girls gonna howl for mike 
 Full moon so I'm gonna bite 
 That's all that's all 
 If I'm wrong don't steer me right 
 What I'm wearing can't pronounce the price 
 The price the price 
 Ride and drive can't dim the lights 
 So tell the sheriff I just kill tonight 
 Tonight 
 It's gone gameover the hangover 
 Just wanna do it over again without tomorrow 
 But don't go back friends 
 'Cause we got benz 
 Who so much pop bottle poppin' 
 Like fairytales it'll never end 
 The move I do it I live it when I can 
 I'm vivid my life should be in high definition 
 I'm what you see on television 
 Focus and listen 
 You wouldn't want to miss it for the would I'm demirring 
 Doc told me I'm my own prescription 
 Myself would only allow the healing I'm finished 
 Ready to pop out and the mischief 
 But don't get it mixed up slim 
 I'm not them 
 I'm just I'm just... 
 Feeling like some patron tonight 
 Yeah I just got my deal tonight tonight tonight 
 And them girls gonna howl for mike 
 Full moon so I'm gonna bite 
 That's all that's all 
 If I'm wrong don't steer me right 
 What I'm wearing can't pronounce the price 
 The price the price 
 Ride and drive can't dim the lights 
 So tell the sheriff I just kill tonight 
 Tonight
