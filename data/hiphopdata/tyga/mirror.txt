Ooh in the mirror 
 I see a f-cken star 
 Got your momma screaming 
 Oh look in the mirror 
 I see a f-cken star 
 Got your momma screaming 
 For me, like I'm ElDebarge 
 Lookin' at my skin 
 All green scars 
 Bitch I think I'm pac 
 Gold hair and bow (ah) 
 Lambo, Ralph sag 
 Poppin' purple tags 
 Show my face for cash 
 I'm a need a mask 
 For the love of money, I'll never love again 
 When you start to get it, bitch you'll understand 
 I'm holding my balls 
 Lettin them know I'm the man 
 The realer I get (the realer I get) 
 The better they shakin' my hand 
 Medicine man 
 Sick of these roll 
 Playas stealin' my slang 
 Beast mode, K Perkins 
 In the muthaf-cken (muthaf-cken) 
 Brought my shack just in case 
 In the party if you pop off 
 See it's there, baby take yo top off 
 Man you niggas, man you niggas 
 Fuck yo knockoffs 
 I keep my girl Louis Vuitton with some goyard 
 Damn they real, order them all 
 That's an auto-fraud 
 Almost bought one, they told me 60 thou 
 I took my cash, spend it round town like Taz 
 Last king, young CEO, my nigga Jazz 
 Bitch it's rainin, duffel bag 
 It's opportune, let's make it fast 
 You goin' let it drip a little 
 Then I'm a make it splash 
 Box it in a doggy bag 
 I be hungry, later man 
 Man, I'm a f-cken king 
 Look what's on my f-cken chest 
 Startin' to smell like money in this bitch 
 Guess you know it's Young Money in this bitch 
 Tyga Tyga Gudda Gudda we in this bitch 
 Tyga Tyga Gudda Gudda yeah he in this bitch 
 Gudda Gudda: 
 Bitch I'm on fire 
 Young Money rida' 
 Let the tool off for my nigga Tyga Tyga 
 Give 'em hell with the written spittin' hot sauce 
 Treat your head like a fake purse, get knocked off 
 The coupe I take the top off 
 Woof, bitch, top dog 
 Lay yo girl face on my lap, let her play with my sack 
 Then the bitch get lock jaw 
 We on top like toupes 
 Hat to the back, with 2 braids 
 Weezy out in 2 days 
 Young Money (Thursday) 
 We about to act up 
 Money I'm a stack up 
 Crack my safe burn 100 stacks, and then I'm a crack up 
 I'm hittin' like a Mack truck 
 Gun make a bitch nigga back up 
 Stacks on deck 
 Hit a nigga on the neck 
 And the bitch nigga don't get back up 
 Young Gudda times 2, that the name, hoe 
 Got a pot of gold like the end of the rainbow 
 You ain't a ballin' nigga what the fuck you came for 
 Oh you here with yo main hoe 
 I'm leaving with that same hoe 
 Gudda 
 Startin' to smell like money in this bitch 
 Guess you know it's Young Money in this bitch
