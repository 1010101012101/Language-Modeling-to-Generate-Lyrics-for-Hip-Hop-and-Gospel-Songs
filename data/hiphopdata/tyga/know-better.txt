Rain come easy the clouds are here 
 Tell me there must be a reason 
 The road that I've walked 
 Paved on with fear 
 I'm lost but I can't stop breathin' 
 But I know better, I know know better but I, 
 Know better, I know know better but I, know better I know know better, 
 That don't make nothin' better 
 Some say I didn't know better 
 Usin' paper for lyrics instead of scholorship letters 
 Tenth grade drop out flew in the worst weather 
 Graduated rap class with flyin' feathers 
 Holdin' it, like life can't get better 
 Check my myspace the kid got it's own banner 
 My top 8 just friends before the bright cameras 
 We all livin' life, can't shhh damage 
 It's one thing in the street homie missin' trust 
 In the fast life in the cup 
 Take the pill, drink it up 
 Money ain't the only thing throwin' up 
 Wait, gimme that 
 I mean, you trying to get paid or what? 
 That;s the sound of getting thrown up 
 That's the ground has my hustle stumps? 
 I make a fist to keep my brady in the bunch 
 Well that means my fettuccine is just piling up 
 Rain come easy the clouds are here 
 Tell me there must be a reason 
 The road that I've walked 
 Paved on with fear 
 I'm lost but I can't stop breathin' 
 But I know better, I know know better but I, 
 Know better, I know know better but I, know better I know know better, 
 That don't make nothin' better 
 If you knew better than that you would do better 
 But you're cool getting your back 
 The lines get severed 
 And you might sit in the back, 
 In a class like whatever 
 But you never getting better, just steady committing errors 
 How you define the same frame of mind 
 When it's different lines and different guide lines 
 And you can feel it it your spine when it ain't right 
 Kissing your baby and your bottle in the same night 
 As it goes, never the same 
 Every blow, where there's pain 
 Sometime but you never know, never gain 
 You never blow, never change 
 Sometimes it's a difficult choice, what you want and what you need 
 It's all some type of greed 
 You lightheaded when you get that green 
 You kiss a stripper in the mouth and watch you tongue bleed 
 Rain come easy the clouds are here 
 Tell me there must be a reason 
 The road that I've walked 
 Paved on with fear 
 I'm lost but I can't stop breathin' 
 But I know better, I know know better but I, 
 Know better, I know know better but I, know better I know know better, 
 That don't make nothin' better 
 Know know better but I, 
 Know better, I know know better but I, know better I know know better, 
 That don't make nothin' better
