When they hate on ya (x4) I turn around and put my shades on. 
 When they hate on ya (shades on) (x4) 
 (Tyga:) 
 Big money with the power 
 Till I hit this off by the hour 
 Pop out the jet to the tours 
 Both top floors are ours (How could you) 
 Now love love love, what you into 
 I'm in the magazine now, what's an issue 
 Go cry baby here, get a tissue, get a tissue, call me when you get through 
 'Cause I'll be the boss as low 
 Yellow terms as the cars they go 
 So on until dorn, we toast if they get too close just remember though 
 Bow to what you now witness 
 Lyrical chemist 
 Cage with the kiddis 
 Can't get my name on my meaning 
 If I said it than I'm in it when you hear it over 
 Get it 
 Hit it off downtown neh feed him 
 That's what I heard from a bird whisper, ask him 
 Whether lecker 
 Getting that b*'s 
 Saying on twitter 
 They see me from a distance (really) 
 'Cause I'll be the boss as low 
 Yellow terms as the cars they go 
 So on until dorn, we toast if they get too close just remember though 
 Cardiac the zeal Loui V 
 Great band porche (Gucci) (x4)
