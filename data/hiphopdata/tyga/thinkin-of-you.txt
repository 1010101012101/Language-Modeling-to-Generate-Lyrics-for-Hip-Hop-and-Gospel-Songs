Lil Wayne: 
 Uh 
 And mama used to say someday some girl gon get me 
 Uh 
 But I wouldn't know love it it walked right up and hit me 
 Uh 
 And if I fall to the ground, I'll get up and fight another round 
 But I got money on my mind 
 Money on my mind 
 But now... 
 I keep thinkin' of you 
 I keep, I keep thinkin' of you 
 I keep thinkin' of you girl 
 I keep thinkin' of you 
 I keep, I keep thinkin' of you 
 I keep thinkin' of you girl 
 I keep thinkin' of you I keep, I keep thinkin' of you I keep thinkin' of you girl I keep thinkin' of you I keep, I keep thinkin' of you I keep thinkin' of you girl 
 Hey! 
 And we ain't even gotta go far 
 We ain't gotta talk about the war 
 We can just get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it 
 I said, we ain't even gotta go far 
 We ain't gotta talk about the war 
 We can just get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it 
 I keep thinkin' of you girl 
 Tyga: 
 Damn, I'm just thinkin' 
 '03 winter 
 Chirpin' late night 
 You had the light up antenna 
 Voices far from tenor 
 13 speakin' like we 23 
 Sometimes I would even miss dinner 'cause 
 Talkin' with you was more important 
 Than Jordan's release for the 17's, remember? 
 I get em, similar to any girl I've mentioned 
 They on me, thought I'd mention 
 I'm just playin' with your intuition 
 You seemed to sense that I was different 
 But too flashy for boyfriend material (why?) 
 But I beg to differ 
 And insisted on showing you more material 
 Now listen, let's kiss like Gene Simmons uh 
 Got a vision, fuck a title 
 We the perfect image, you and I 
 No I and them 
 Them girls, you be eyein them 
 'Cause they be eyein him 
 They feelings stronger than vitamins 
 Lovin' you to death I didn't expect 
 Know beautiful girls make you suicidal 
 Guess I'm dyin' 
 Lil Wayne: 
 Um 
 Up jumps the boogie 
 And shawty says she feelin' my flavor 
 And even when I ain't lookin' 
 I got her on my radar 
 And yes I know that I am so so blessed to have her 
 So yesterday, today, and the day after 
 I keep thinkin' of you 
 I keep thinkin' of you 
 Oh I keep... thinkin' 
 I keep thinkin' of you I keep, I keep thinkin' of you I keep thinkin' of you girl I keep thinkin' of you I keep, I keep thinkin' of you I keep thinkin' of you girl I keep thinkin' of you I keep, I keep thinkin' of you I keep thinkin' of you girl I keep thinkin' of you I keep, I keep thinkin' of you I keep thinkin' of you girl 
 Shawty say she feelin' my swag 
 Shawty say she feelin' my style
