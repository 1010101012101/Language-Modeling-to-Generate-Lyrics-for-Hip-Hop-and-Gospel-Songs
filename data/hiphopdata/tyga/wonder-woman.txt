(Chris Brown - Chorus) 
 Tonight I want me a wonder woman 
 Who can save my life 
 Wanna feel her power right now 
 A real wonder woman 
 Come be my hero (tonight) 
 You can take your cape off 
 You don't need that to save my heart 
 You just need to take me, I know you can fly 
 Because I see right through your disguise 
 (Tyga) 
 Damn she bad, damn she bad 
 Heels with the matching bag 
 Mirror with the lip gloss 
 Lick her lips then she laugh 
 Lady Gaga colored Mac 
 All her friends using that 
 She could be on magazines, but she ain't really into that 
 Owww, damn she bad 
 Had to say it twice, its gettin' late 
 You should spend the night 
 No rushing thangs, got a whole lot of game 
 And I'm stuck in my ways, but just for you, I'll change 
 Polaroid camera put this moment on your freezer 
 5 in the mornin' yawning, kiss ya while you sleepin' 
 Half awake I can see you peekin' 
 Wake up baby 'cause... 
 (Chris Brown - Chorus) 
 (Tyga) 
 All shit aside 
 I love the way you walk 
 You got that indie glow 
 Give me some time to watch 
 Freeze freeze you put my heart into anesthesia 
 I love you 'round the clock, wont stop till I get enough 
 Overtime overtime I put in for that Valentine 
 Know you appreciate it baby lingerie (?) lacing 
 Let's get naked, rip our clothes off 
 I'm the doctor you my nurse in a uniform 
 Head game outta control, super heroes on the floor 
 Bruce Banner beat it up, then I turn into the hulk 
 Be my Betty Ross, make the bed rock (all night long) 
 (Chris Brown - Chorus)
