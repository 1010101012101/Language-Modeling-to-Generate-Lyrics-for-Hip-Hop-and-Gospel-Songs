Pain! Deep in my heart! 
 Pain! Got me this far! 
 Pain! Follows me in the dark! 
 Pain! So I copped the new car! 
 Pain! Washed down my thoughts! 
 Pain! Makes me feel nause! 
 Pain! This lifestyle brought! 
 Pain! I'm in so far! 
 First off let me clear this up 
 This was never your dream 
 Now this is what you want! 
 This life just ain't reality to me! 
 Being a star is how I breathe! 
 But you don't wanna let me succeed! 
 (Why!) 
 Now there is people after me! 
 Low key! 
 I ride! 
 No high key! 
 Tires! Low pro! 
 There go Tyga! 
 Dey know! 
 Every verse I flow 
 Times two! 
 His flow so cold! 
 Dey knew! 
 So they stuck around like 
 Bubble gum on shoes 
 Waiting patiently for the food! 
 How many can you feed with one spoon! 
 Got damn nigga let me tie my shoe! 
 I just wanna be in the game and run too! 
 Fall back! Relax ma nigga! 
 And I'll lace u! 
 And take you to a place you can only dream! 
 This industry shady! 
 So I keep it real on the daily! 
 Tyga man I was your friend! 
 Now it's! 
 Pain! Deep in my heart! 
 Pain! Got me this far! 
 Pain! Follows me in the dark! 
 Pain! So I copped the new car! 
 Pain! Washed down my thoughts! 
 Pain! Makes me feel nause! 
 Pain! This lifestyle brought! 
 Pain! I'm in so far 
 Yeah! 
 Pain is pressure 
 That never intended to get a nigga like me! 
 Ha-ha that's what I feel pain is! 
 How come! 
 When someone betters they self they run! 
 And tell someone else 
 He ont help he ont care 
 He for self fuck his wealth 
 That's how I feel! 
 When I'm performin on the stage! 
 This shit just fills my rage! 
 Shout out to rage! 
 He said 
 "Fuck what they say! " 
 Let the haters hate bcuz now I'm paid! 
 Coconut juice you was there too! 
 Coconut juice in the booth! 
 Youtube! Youtube can't witness the truth! 
 I've been doin' this with or without you niggas! 
 Tyga I will not house you niggas! 
 I will shit on you boys in house shoes niggas!

 Should of kept Your mouth shut niggas 
 U could of had cheese!
