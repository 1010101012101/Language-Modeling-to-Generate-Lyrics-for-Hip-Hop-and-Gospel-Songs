It's been a long damn time since a nigga sold dope 
 But if you put a brick right in front of me 
 I remember 
 Baking soda and a triple bean, I remember 
 Load a fully auto magazine, I remember 
 I done fucked so many bitches 
 That I can't remember names 
 But if you put that pussy right up in my face 
 I remember 
 Drop that pussy down on the floor 
 I remember 
 The way she coming down on the pole 
 I remember 
 Pop the pussy, don't play with it 
 I don't care if Kanye hit it, 
 I don't care if Jay hit it 
 Ima eat it up and Ima lay with it 
 We shot a chop at the gun range 
 Got stupid cars, got dumb change 
 Red bottoms, let the tongue hang 
 Got a off white Porsche, come stains 
 I'm whipping work, I remember 
 Roll up that purp, I remember 
 Pour up that syrup, I don't remember 
 I thought she had that purple slushie 
 Coming out that blender 
 Got a Kesha, got a Rhonda 
 Got a Anisha, got a Tanya 
 Got a Ticia, and a Honda 
 And I eat her, Anaconda 
 Got condoms in that condo 
 Got kush greener than rondo 
 Still hit you up for that blow 
 You already know 
 It's been a long damn time since a nigga sold dope 
 But if you put a brick right in front of me 
 I remember 
 Baking soda and a triple bean, I remember 
 Load a fully auto magazine, I remember 
 I done fucked so many bitches 
 That I can't remember names 
 But if you put that pussy right up in my face 
 I remember 
 Drop that pussy down on the floor 
 I remember 
 The way she coming down on the pole 
 I remember 
 Got a Rolls Royce, got a black Benz 
 Got a bad bitch with some bad friends 
 She bring them through and I fuck them 
 But I don't fuck with them in public 
 Got random bitches just walking up 
 They be like do you remember us 
 She show me that tat on her ass 
 And I be like I remember 
 Chop it up like a blender, 
 I fuck then I be friend her 
 Got a red bitch call her Ginger 
 Ass cash on my agenda 
 You buy the bitch, you rent her 
 She took your cash and I sent her 
 That pussy prolly so tight 
 Calling that shit a legal tender 
 Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up 
 That's a young nigga dinner 
 Feast your eyes to a fucking line 
 That's visine nigga, never cry 
 We were young niggas, wilding out 
 Talking shit to niggas that's 35 
 Your daughter pull in my driveway 
 I smash that in over-drive
