New year, new year 
 New money, new money 
 My state of mind is something they can never take from me! 
 I seen the friends turn to foes when they need the checks 
 I seen girls turn to hoes when they're needing sex. 
 Yeah, man I need the best! 
 On this road to success, ain't no time for you to guess and rest 
 Or to take a break, there ain't no time to wait 
 When it's a nigga out there trying to take your place. 
 I swear I'm going all the way like the G man 
 The celebrating, party hard on the weekend 
 But right now, I still got a lot of work to do 
 They always tell me... do whatever you can work for you! 
 Bad bitches I had a few! 
 I'm all alone at the top, so you know I got a perfect view! 
 People need to understand that I'm here to stay 
 Have your girl body aching like my name is Clay. 
 My inner circle get smaller every single day 
 Cause people wanna envy when you're hotter than Montego Bay! 
 Ha ha ha nightmares every single day 
 I go do it while these other niggas run away. 
 Nowaday you don't need talent, just to reach success 
 All you need is a fat ass and show the world your breasts 
 Hoes would be hoes, you already know 
 So shout out to the women that will be tricking all across the globe! 
 A lot of people say, "I'll never be nothing! " 
 Now they got their hands out like need something 
 They'll be like, damn, I always knew you will make it big 
 I told those people they should hop on my fucking dick! 
 Non new, non new 
 Man, I tell them none new! 
 Young... BBC, 
 Man, you're fucking with the crew! 
 Non new, non new 
 Man, I tell them non new 
 Yeah, I'm about to kill the game 
 And ain't nothing you can do 
 'Cause I'm putting on, going strong, 
 Working hard, so at the top I belong! 
 Non new, non new 
 Man, I tell them none new! 
 Young... BBC 
 Man, your're fucking with the crew! 
 Non new, non new! 
 I live my life like a dangerous zone 
 And sweet at night like it's... 
 I put on for the city that I call my home 
 And take shots, sip some Henny when I feel alone. 
 Nothing new, man I swear that's all I do 
 Now they know I'm in the game 
 So they're about to get the blues! 
 And they knew my flow is sick, 
 So they're about to catch the flue 
 And these bitches gimmie brain, till I never had a clue 
 Yeah, Jules, who is you? 
 You ain't nothing, I can see the lies 
 Your flow week, but you got some people by your side! 
 I love my past ways in the ashtray 
 Now I'm trying to be the world's greatest like I'm cash clay! 
 I kill tracks on my bad days 
 When you rap it's like nest and the cash play, you ass nigga! 
 Why do people always act like you live in terror? 
 Why is my only competition the man in the mirror 
 Non new, non new 
 Man, I tell them none new! 
 Young... BBC, 
 Man, you're fucking with the crew! 
 Non new, non new 
 Man, I tell them non new 
 Yeah, I'm about to kill the game 
 And ain't nothing you can do 
 'Cause I'm putting on, going strong, 
 Working hard, so at the top I belong! 
 Non new, non new 
 Man, I tell them none new! 
 Young... BBC 
 Man, your're fucking with the crew! 
 Non new, non new!
