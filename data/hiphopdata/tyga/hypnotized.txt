Uh, just bought a condo downtown, high as f-ck 
 27th, floor all the b-tches down to f-ck 
 Big donkey butt, Ciroc coconut 
 Big gulps, drink it all like a Slurpee cup 
 Brain freeze, ice like a hockey puck 
 London town, Westwood, what the f-ck is up? 
 Just checked my account, another hundred thou' 
 N-ggas sendin' me money like I'm PayPal 
 Wait pal, pow pow, 40 cal 
 Smith N Wessun, make a wrestler whistle loud 
 I'm in the grocery store, can't even walk the aisles 
 Ya girls see me, nah, I'm takin' pictures with a smile 
 Sunlight reflectin' off my gold skin 
 Last King killing everything you dressin' in 
 Blacks, Mexicans say, when your shit goin' drop? 
 I tell em, Careless World probly goin' make the world stop 
 Vibrate your soul, make your p-ssy pop 
 Presidential suite, tip the bell hop 
 I speak a language, your money like a C-note 
 Spitting my phlegm on pictures birds and eagles 
 I'm on a mission to Mars, Don Cheadle 
 I'm a legend to y'all ordinary people 
 From Hollywood to Cerritos 
 The black beatles, and I ain't even got a single 
 And living single 
 All my diamonds seem clear 
 Louie trunks in my living room b-tches stare 
 Who is this young? how'd he manage to make it here 
 The future is ours, robotic sports car 
 Paid for, therefore, beach chair just chillin' 
 I don't eat pork and I've never tried chillins 
 Its hard living in hell, why should demons avail? 
 Turn into a human shell 
 Hate you 'cause they hate themselves 
 Haah, blood thinner, poppin' pills to stay balanced 
 On or off the road, everydays a challenge 
 I need a studio, book me room A achalice? 
 I gotta go its gettin' late and I ain't got my license 
 Cop pull me over and shit, asking why I was driving reckless 
 I told I'm I was a rapper, look at my watch 
 Sstill gave me a ticket though 
 Black thoughts in my eyes got me hypnotized 
 Black thoughts in my eyes got me hypnotized 
 Black thoughts in my eyes got me hypnotized 
 Open your mind 
 Black thoughts in my eyes got me hypnotized 
 Black thoughts in my eyes got me hypnotized 
 Black thoughts in my eyes got me hypnotized 
 Open your mind
