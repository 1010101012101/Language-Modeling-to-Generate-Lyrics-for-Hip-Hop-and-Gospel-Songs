 Shit 
 I approach it wit my nose lit 
 No scent 
 Since I'm guaranteed in the lead I'm in 
 Ball bottle buying, 
 Papi sick no medicine 
 Sippin the elegant swank 
 Walk like elephants 
 Smooth the scene 
 Canvas color is green 
 I don't move unless the car clean 
 Call me 
 Dial Money in between 
 The boss like Bosley 
 You wont see but you heard it's me 
 I'm one of the henches hurdel-in 
 Murderer

 This trophy my evidence 
 It's evident 
 Evidently niggas bitches full of Estrogen 
 In the corridor 
 Never bored 
 Get busy BITCH 
 Seven doors had that white whore on some corny shit 
 Me 
 I support chicks 
 Poor 'em in that spore shit 
 Tell 'em get that mortgage 
 Morgan bring more in 
 Forced into foursomes 
 Now she a TOP bitch 
 Cashed in 
 I Be on my Diddy Shit
