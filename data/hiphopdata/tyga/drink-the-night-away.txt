(Tyga) 
 Uh, line full of b-tches 
 Hard fine b-tches 
 The shit that I'm smokin' got me higher than tuition 
 Wanna know what's goin' on let me paint a picture 
 And if ya ain't around lemme give ya a description 
 Corks everywhere, hoes everywhere 
 Loud music playin' heavy smoke in the air 
 Its cups everywhere, flashin' lights 
 Bottles of Patron, sittin' in the ice like... 
 (Mario) 
 It's a celebration 
 Bottles by the cases 
 Tonight we goin' all get wasted 
 Then we goin' take off like spaceships 
 Oh, and I don't really want her to leave 
 (Tyga) 
 Order bottle after bottle 
 She say she can't drink, ay shut up b-tch swallow 
 (We gon' drink the night away, we gon' drink the night away) 
 Ah Mr. Rose Raw 
 2 piece suit cuff link on the arm 
 Sex on the beach and some shots for these broads 
 And bring the biggest bottle of Moet for my dawgs 
 We on the couch leanin' on the wall 
 My old b-tch hit me said I seen you with them hoes 
 But I'm turnt up so a n-gga lost his phone 
 I gotta find a freak take her home 
 Hit the light like uh 
 Same day different chick y'all 
 Took girls all around the world up on Crenshaw 
 In and out the crib back and forth like ping pong 
 Me and Game got the hoe jumpin' Kriss Kross 
 I'm the shit so piss off 
 Better yet, find me somethin' to piss on 
 I'm too drunk, how I take it this far 
 Wake up, and do it all again tomorrow 
 (Mario) 
 It's a celebration 
 Bottles by the cases 
 Tonight we gon' all get wasted 
 Then we gon' take off like spaceships 
 But I don't really want her to leave 
 (Tyga) 
 Uh, order bottle after bottle 
 She say she can't drink, ay shut up b-tch swallow 
 (We goin' drink the night away, we goin' drink the night away) 
 (Game) 
 Uh, uh sicker than cancer 
 Colder than Aspen 
 West side ridin' wit Tyga 
 Tiger fur inside the Aston 
 Martin dependin' on who askin'? 
 Got so many chickens, all my birds in one basket 
 And that's a coupe for you, retract the roof for you 
 It's a Doggy Dog world, and I can call Snoop for ya 
 Uh that's gangsta, that's fly 
 Yo baby mamas mama would say I'm one hell of a guy 
 Why do I start beefs, why do I drop Phantoms 
 Why I got 7 houses but none in Atlanta 
 (That's stupid) 
 Nah n-gga smarter than Bill Gates 
 Clap ya hands I do it 
 With the sound that still make 
 I know the real Weezy, introduce you to the real Drake 
 My hoes more patient that Detox fans, they will wait 
 For me to go um, 10 times platinum 
 And cop more Patron and hatin' n-ggas imagine 
 (Mario) 
 It's a celebration 
 Tonight we gon' all get wasted 
 Then we goin' take off like spaceships 
 But I don't really want her to leave 
 Don't leave, don't be scared 
 It ain't a game, meet me in the bed 
 And we gon' drink the night away 
 Oh I don't really want you to leave baby 
 Whoa, I don't really want you to leave 
 Come celebrate with me baby
