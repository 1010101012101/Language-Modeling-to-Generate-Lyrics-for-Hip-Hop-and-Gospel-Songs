Motherfuck a spirit of Hitler 
 Scared hicka, you rap niggas 
 I turtle-shell niggas 
 In Harold and Bell, niggas 
 Eat you like lunch, before the bell 
 Welcome to hell, niggas 
 Tyga IROC like Camaro 87 engines 
 Black bat, your car's vision 
 Snapbacks, no fucking fitteds 
 My last dinner in a rapper's kitchen 
 Need a dentist after niggas leave you dental dinning 
 They call me hall pussy, I'm porky the pig with it 
 Leave a poker-face face even if a fan can get it 
 Okay I really got anger 
 Kids should never talk to strangers 
 Might get you flat-out hangered on a barb-wire hanger 
 I'm happy that I'm famous 
 Not a A-list 
 Fresh out gorilla cages 
 When a train crush your fucking face, bitch 
 Poppy bangin', no rags just bloody statements 
 This music segment can help you nigga's times wasting 
 White faces, see me and say my charms racist 
 The ice layers remind 'em of a lemon cake, mm 
 It's Young Money Hades 
 Home of the mic rabies 
 Tyga man, I'm part Asian 
 G.E.D-ing on the daily
