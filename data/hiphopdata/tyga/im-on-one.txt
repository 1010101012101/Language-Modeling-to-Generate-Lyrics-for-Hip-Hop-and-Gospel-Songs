All these n-ggas stealin swag 
 I been gettin' tats since I was 14 
 Tell my b-tch throw it in the bag 
 22 for the bald man jeans 
 I'm smokin' these n-ggas they need uh nicotine 
 Rat race first place famous like a kennedy 
 All my diamonds lemoney 
 Heart stay below degree 
 To many bitches mary them all, 
 Piligamy 
 Huh make your waterfall, 
 Yosemite 
 Highest underated n-gga 
 I don't need you rating me 
 Sold out show way before the sh-t with bet 
 Knockin' down my front door 
 B-tches trying to peep and see 
 Last kings YMCMB you know the team 
 Just counted 50 thou in my walled off suite 
 Sh man this life is to f-cking easy ferrai red all over 
 Call it santa bleeding 
 Pipe dreamin' put the reality key in 
 All we do is win everyday is uh f-cking weekend 
 Me and my b-tch riding around bumpin the weekend 
 You don't wanna feature me... 
 Ima eat your beat then 
 Ugh... spit out its nasty 
 She don't wanna swallow kids 
 But she love gaggin 
 High fashion ass models and beauty pagents 
 Young alladin vesace carpet I need uh jasmine 
 Tour bus ridin' I got to show up in Dallas 
 Tyga maverick loue v bed fabric 
 Haha I swear these n-ggas movin backwards 
 I'm moving faster 
 Tell them n-ggas to put original in all my captions... 
 N-gga ... 
 (Well Done)
