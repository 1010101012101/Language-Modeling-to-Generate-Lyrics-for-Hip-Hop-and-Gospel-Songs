 Made her giggle when I met her, 
 She started off kinda hard to get, 
 Told her I'd get her 
 She said she like 'em really reallies 
 What I'm gonna give her 
 I could tell she had her heart broke bout three-four times 
 Girl by me never 
 We at the movies, 
 She all into me, 
 I'm lookin' at her 
 Out the corner of my eye, 
 What's she doing? 
 She got up out of her seat, 
 Nowhere to be found (found) 
 Her girlfriends lookin' for her 
 They don't know we fooling around (round) 
 She told me she ain't never met no one that made her wanna 
 And she don't know what it is that has come over her 
 She giving me signals, like she don't (she don't) fell in love 
 I don't know if that's what we doin' but I wanna tear it up 
 When we got to the car she said 
 Just keep your eyes on the road while I do this
