Lil mama, whatcha doing? 
 Wassup? (love, love) 
 'Cause I ain't gotta work this weekend 
 Let's get up (up up) 
 And I just wanna dance and play a lil' bit 
 And baby I'm the man, and shawty you the shit 
 Think about it, we can do something nasty 
 Well I got my energy up 
 All in the club with the lights down low 
 And I got you, tipsy and you all up on me 
 Pulling on my clothes 
 I ain't finish my drink, but I want some more 
 Girl get your purse, let me grab my coat 
 Got my keys, so Nelly can roll back to the crib 
 I wanna make love to my baby 
 Do it all day, and we can do it all night long (shawty) 
 I wanna make love to my baby 
 Have it your way, but I like it with the lights on 
 I'm a make love to my baby 
 Girl, get on top of me and I'm a let you take it off 
 Tonight, is your night, baby 
 So I'm a love you down 
 All I think about, when she's not around 
 If I get to see her, I'm going take her down 
 Pull your tights down, throw 'em on the couch 
 Like say, put it in your mouth 
 Take your top off, ain't nobody around 
 Run around butt naked, this is my house 
 All these thoughts in my mind, I gotta get 'em out 
 Trying, but I can't figure how 
 Remember high school 
 I used to skip class just to sex you 
 Home room was the only place I could call you 
 Now it's like every time I call, never get through 
 All that bullshit that we been through, damn I miss you 
 It's like you kicked a nigga out, moved on to the next one 
 I hope maybe we can work it out 
 Damn, I be wishing you was here right now 
 I wanna make love to my baby 
 Do it all day, and we can do it all night long (shawty) 
 I wanna make love to my baby 
 Have it your way, but I like it with the lights on 
 I'm a make love to my baby 
 Girl, get on top of me and I'm a let you take it off 
 Tonight, is your night, baby 
 So I'm a love you down 
 Kissing on your body, laying on top of me (Oh oh oh oh) 
 From the bed to the ground, I'm a go down (Oh oh oh oh) 
 Doing my thing, tell me when to stop 
 Girl I wanna see, what you all about 
 Sweating like a sauna, put that dick on ya (all night) 
 Well I got my energy up 
 All in the club with the lights down low 
 And I got you, tipsy and you all up on me 
 Pulling on my clothes 
 I ain't finish my drink, but I want some more 
 Girl get your purse, let me grab my coat 
 Got my keys, so Nelly can roll back to the crib 
 I wanna make love to my baby 
 Do it all day, and we can do it all night long (shawty) 
 I wanna make love to my baby 
 Have it your way, but I like it with the lights on 
 I'm a make love to my baby 
 Girl, get on top of me and I'm a let you take it off 
 Tonight, is your night, baby 
 So I'm a love you down
