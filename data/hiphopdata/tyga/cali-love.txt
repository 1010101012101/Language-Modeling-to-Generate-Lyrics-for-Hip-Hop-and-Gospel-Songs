Tyga 
 California 
 The home of a king 
 The place for an angel 
 Flyer than doves 
 I just wanna bring the cali love back! 
 Sittin' here thinkin' when they put cali on 
 88 Cube and Dre; I wasn't even born 
 So I just wanna keep cali on 
 Fuck what happened to the cali love 
 Cigar smoke when the legends shoot videos 
 Snoop gettin' old and Pac is really gone 
 So I just wanan keep cali on 
 Fuck what happened to the cali love 
 See artists hate lovin' this young artist (ME!) 
 Critique all em 
 Y'all ain't nothing but cheap condoms 
 Bitch fuck all y'all those talking but are suportin 
 I hear ya sounds loud and clear your shit sound distorted 
 I'm'a pope to get on it 
 I'm the one next to best does it 
 Remove your earpluggin I never stutter 
 Unt-till now brother my city will now love me 
 If anyone be found clubbin that's time for those a hundred 
 Young money that big boy money its nothin' 
 To sit and watch the sony plasma when you on it (THATS ME!)
