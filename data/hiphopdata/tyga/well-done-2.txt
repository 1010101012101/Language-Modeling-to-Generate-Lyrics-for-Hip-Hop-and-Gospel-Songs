 Treat my dick like a dog bitch fetch 
 I put it down your throat then I buss it on your neck 
 T-killer I'ma mess homer simpson in the flesh 
 Yeah I'm doper then syringe f-ck yo bitch and all her friends 
 Make amends for all my sins I ain't trippin' on a bitch 
 I'm a bull give me wings too many tats on my skin 
 You know my rank nigga if you speakin' come proper 
 Hit you with a shot like boom shaka laka 
 Knock your ass to your feet like too much vodka 
 I'm hotter than a 2 dollar pistol from a Rasta 
 Yeah they call me Tyga with a heart of Mufassa 
 Nigga I ain't lyin', hard to find like a fossil 
 I'll be outta here king shit like Cairo 
 Asian nigga kick you in the face tai bo 
 I'm rising with the heat on these niggas like pyro 
 I'm just freestylin a nigga young and wildin' 
 Lord I done suffered through too many years 
 And we done shed so so many tears 
 Lost many peers no memories 
 Just misery killing all my enemies 
 F-ck her till she can't see f-ck until we can't breath 
 Knock knock who there, dez nuts in your face 
 Bitch I'm eatin get a plate 
 All my niggas do the same most my homies hoover gang 
 Uh Larry Hoover, Lawrence Taylor, giant glocks 
 Patch your eye like a raider 
 Too many bitches call it p-ssy mania 
 Niggas tryna ball, swag, I don't do favors 
 Pac shit middle finger, finger f-ck who ever hating 
 I'm the shit y'all niggas constipated 
 F-ck yo bitch its easy even to a caveman 
 I'm good, make it, make it rain till the roof cave in 
 85 laker, high rise, purple lasers 
 Marc Jacobs famous like the morning laser 
 No patients leave her in the lobby waiting 
 Vacation nigga I ain't talking Vegas 
 Well, Well done! Well, Well Done! Well, Well Done! 
 Finish him!
