Snapbacks back, snapback back 
 That's all these niggas saying I brought snapbacks back 
 I'm a fresh as nigga, bitches know I'm the shit 
 25 for my belt, nigga, get off my dick 
 Snapbacks back, snapback back 
 That's all these niggas saying I brought snapbacks back 
 I'm a fresh as nigga, bitches know I'm the shit 
 25 for my belt, nigga, get off my dick

 Man, all these niggas foul like hack-a-Shaq 
 Nigga racks on racks, my bitch ass so fat 
 Yo bitch booty like a pancake, flat flapjack 
 I make your dollars collapse, trail low in the strap 
 Shells big as a turtle, Master Splinter to rap 
 Spin you like Urkel, your body hanging from fat 
 Thought you was sharper than tacks 
 Get you thrown like some jacks 
 All these bitches with these tassels 
 On their titties trying tax 
 I don't give a fuck if none of y'all don't rap 
 I could pull a bitch just turning my back 
 Who knew that, Venus Trap 
 Flyest nigga in the class 
 Goyard bag, see that tag? 
 I could pay your rent all year, boy 
 Yo' mama know 
 Your cousin, sister, brother and your mama know 
 Your cousin, sister, brother and your mama know 
 Your cousin, sister, brother and your mama know 
 Bitch, your granny know nigga

 Leggo, snapback back, put V.A. on the map 
 I'm a young nigga, heartthrob, girls cardiac 
 I got your girls all on my dick 
 Yeah, them chickens giving me neck 
 Nigga, you ain't talking 'bout shit 
 Fuck your city, press eject 
 Too busy coughing up them hairballs fur coat, bear dog 
 Spray these niggas like Aerosol and fuck them old niggas, Geritol 
 Hold up, snapback on 
 Champagne MCM backpack on 
 Lucky that my situation in this probation 
 Won't even let me strap that tome 
 My condo ain't no hotter I be right at home 
 What you mean, nigga, I'm coherent? 
 Steez out with my D out 
 And you wonder why your shorty be disappearing 
 Ha ha, I brought the snapback back 
 Last kings and them Ti$as, yeah, they sell like crack 
 You got no car insurance, no Ray-Bans, this Geico, caveman 
 First of the month you do a praise dance 
 Like I'm moving on up, aye man 
 Stop that, drop a hat in the club 
 They gon' be like that nigga on drugs 
 Get more respect in L.A. than you do 
 Stay in your lanes
