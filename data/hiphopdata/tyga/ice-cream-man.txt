She like to fuck me, s**k me, s**k then fuck me 
 I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey 
 She like to fuck me, s**k me, s**k then fuck me 
 I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey 
 She like to twirly swirly, in my vanilla coupe 
 She like my sugar cone seats I just took off the roof 
 She got a marshmallow booty, I like to sprinkle it too 
 I'm the ice cream man, this my song when I'm riding through 
 She like to fuck me, s**k me, s**k then fuck me 
 I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey 
 I'm the ice cream man, she chunky monkey 
 All these money hungry hungry hippos wanna love me 
 All these diamonds dusty, mine just clear and sunny 
 I don't rock Giuseppes, nah them shits is ugly 
 I'm in the ghetto, the gutter, I got the sugar the butter 
 I got the mama the brother, oh yeah your son is a hustler 
 She wanna fuck and s**k, but I ain't gon rush it 
 I'm the ice cream man, I ball every summer 
 These boys wanna run it, that's cool 'cause I need more runners 
 Tell 'em get me more condoms, we doing more fucking 
 Banana clip, bandana tied around my head 
 Bandana bread we getting fed 
 I like my pie Alamo 
 She instagramming a move, a pic of me and my goons 
 She like to fuck me, s**k me, s**k then fuck me 
 I don't rock Giuseppes, nah them shits is ugly 
 I'm insane... candy paint Ferrari, baby lick this caramel 
 Camo, I came with an army 
 She wanna fuck then s**k me, I think it's Sunday Monday 
 Tuesday I be busy, Wednesday I be out the country 
 When the club is jumping tell them ni**as cut the bungie 
 Tell 'em cut the check, my number's jumping
