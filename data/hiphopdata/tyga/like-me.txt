Uh yeah b-tch I'm ballin, bi-ch I'm balling 
 Betchu n-gga, he ain't balling (like me) 
 Yeah, b-tches choosing and they calling 
 'Cause I'm balling said they wanna f-ck a n-gga (like me) 
 And my n-ggas paid, they ain't never gotta pay (like me) 
 Yeah b-tch I'm ballin, b-tch I'm balling 
 Betchu n-gga, he ain't balling (like me) 
 Uh, tyga strike, rally paint 
 I'm the sh-t, b-tch let it stink (let it stink) 
 Rinse your eyes with my holy water, I ain't gone take her 
 I know that's his only daughter, n-gga whatchu thinkin'? 
 This that big bang rapper ballin, huh 
 I don't even drink, but she alcoholic 
 Baby sip it till it's gone (yeah I know it) 
 Uh, cash like coke, b-tches gotta blow it. 
 So put your number on this paper, I promise I'll call 
 No, I can't called b-tch I'm lying, I don't use my phone, sh-t 
 Sh-t is on silence all day long 
 I don't need no interruption when I'm makin' you moan 
 Early morn, wake up, then you yawn 
 Breakfast in bed, waffles in the little head, Roscoe's 
 Chickens and waffles instead, and right back to this balling sh-t 
 'Cause I'm ballin, b-tch 
 Uh, hotel suite, presidential 
 F-ck you bitchin whatchu been through 
 I got two doors homie, one side for my clothes 
 Another side for my big shoes 
 Now that's ballin, don't think that's ballin? 
 Mothaf-cker how would you know it, if you've never done it 
 I turned my engine on loud, wake the neighbor, honey 
 Life like chocolate when you getting money 
 Rain, rain dollar bills in my dreams 
 B-tches fighting for me like it's Jerry Spring' 
 But is the summer, winter, they fallin' for me 
 Colder than a coca cola polo, 7 degrees 
 You know you watch TV, separate your mind, please 
 If you're the bomb b-tch, why you tryna tick with me 
 Remove your top, time to pop 
 She said she like it rough, so I beat it up, p-ssy punch 
 King lazareth, living on that lavish sh-t (?) 
 Lose your mind, lose your sense 
 Pay attention, yeah you feeling me 
 Fill my cup high as trees, relax feel the breeze 
 All jokes aside, got a mistress on the side 
 If you ridin' for me then you gone ride or die 
 Ruff Ryder Volume 2 my love 
 If you wanna party, got a party bus 
 Capacity us, full moon, brandy glass 
 So loosen your Gucci baby, lemme spank that ass 
 Taste so good, blue berry (?) 
 Berry berry cherry, whip cream on the side 
 You can applaud that, terminator, I'll be right back 
 Say my name, Tyga man, screaming so loud, like I know you can
