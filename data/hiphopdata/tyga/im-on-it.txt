(Chorus - Tyga) 
 I'm on it, I'm on it 
 I'm on it 
 If we talking about money bitch 
 I'm on it 
 (Verse 1 - Tyga) 
 Snap back chin up 
 Gold chain nigga 
 Stripes no Tigger, Tyga, bitches 
 Hundred proof liquor 
 Live no liver 
 There's hoes in this motherfucking straight, tripping 
 A nigga know different 
 So we hold the E though 
 Smash on the bitch brains looking like meatloaf 
 The hoe know me close, she lying, Leo's 
 Pedigree swag is so cold, zero 
 Hop in Medino, oops I meant Modena, 
 Life is a bitch better know how to treat her 
 I don't get between, my goal be to win 
 Young Money Heisman, rookies of the year, bitch 
 (Verse 2 - Tyga) 
 Raise hell boy hell yeah I'm hot hello 
 Boy yellow, but my bitch black from the ghetto 
 Put the flow want to pop watch the shit sizzle 
 You grilling me? Better break fast McGriddle 
 I ain't finna slow down, keep running your mouth 
 I'm running the wheel skate, party in the fucking house 
 My niggas is loud in the lobby they can't shut us down 
 Pop pop a drink drink drink some Coke and a smile 
 No clown, but I hit the party then I'm out 
 I run town all day twenty four miles 
 A hundred and fifty on the dash can't even count 
 Keep fucking bitch, ain't shit to talk about 
 (Verse 3 - Lil Wayne) 
 Be-best rapper C.E.O. 
 Fine as wine flow 
 Pinot Grigio 
 Niggas can't fuck with me 
 Need the bitches, need the hoes 
 Life is a motherfucking gamble, Peter Rose 
 Momma taught me well, kush in the L 
 Paper everywhere like books just fell 
 More money to make, more pussy to smell 
 Like yeah, I'm a Libra like put that on a scale 
 New Orleans nigga with my dick up in my right hand 
 Young Money nigga money longer then a lifespan 
 Still go to sleep with my Bible on my nightstand 
 Flyer then a bitch and you ain't even got your flight planned
