Tyga: 
 I ain't never been cheap 
 I spend it all 
 Never made Varsity but I fucking ball 
 14 fuck school I'm a rapper dawg 
 Snap back boy take that fucking fitted off 
 Fall to they knees plead for their right to breath 
 Lord please devour all my enemies 
 That was Pac talking Bitch now back up off me 
 I'm that yellow gold boss and you looking bossy 
 Walk the water if I could bitch I think I'm Moses 
 Tell 'em shut the fuck up with that comotion 
 I'm counting money get enough, get a promotion 
 I sizzling up, hotter than a bowl of momma porridge 
 Whole body covered in green like Dinosaurus 
 Gimme neck, baby bend all your spinal chords 
 Uh uh, [?] ass goofy 
 Tryna blend in like a motherfucking smoker 
 Take a seat you fucking up the movie 
 I'm on the couch standing while you staring at the movement 
 Young Money bitch I do this 
 Hand in my mind both sides one lie two crimes 
 Otherside don't fire 
 Fully dazed like a dream I ain't moving bitch 
 We grooving [?] 
 Fully trippin' I could prove it 
 Switch blade where my boot is 
 All that sweet talk leave a nigga toothless 
 Now you goofy 
 I'm an asshole and my car dufus 
 Mikey rock chucks like the cool kids 
 Bitch it's so dangerous 
 Haters envy me 'cause they angry 
 So you want that beef 
 Than the bitch I'm arranging it 
 More famous than these no name niggas 
 That you hanging with 
 All my homies on like the cable is 
 Say seiko watch TV Tyga psycho 
 Don't play tyco, 50 tyson I'll bite you 
 No license still driving 
 Used to lease it now I buy it 
 Hard cash blood diamonds 
 Niggas violent baby's crying 
 Mr Niceguy 
 Come sell the product 
 I'm a a niceguy 
 But I never went to college 
 Can't live long in imagination 
 Don't compare me to no basic bitch 
 I'm better stop debating motherfucka 
 Motherfucka 
 (Well done)
