(Verse: Tyga) 
 Tyga, Tyga 
 Young money 
 Lloyd I got you 
 Life move fast 
 Everyday flash 
 We like hand bags (girls gotta grab) 
 Some say it's bad to love with a laugh 
 She smiles at me (don't even know who I am) 
 But she with me tonight till the a.m. 
 Said I gotta go 
 She like 
 Wait where's your friend 
 Wait I'm feelin' him 
 I meant you (you was easier to get to) 
 Club life leave the mind frozen 
 Never seen ice strike like good bowling 
 Pinned to the sofa 
 See it much closer 
 Big moses I slide in like loafers 
 Haha shame like to say 
 She stay where we stay and we stay in 
 Every state 
 It's my nature that makes you naughty girl 
 I'm feelin' you but sorry girl 
 (Chorus: Lloyd) 
 I don't want no party girl, sneaking over time 
 Just need me someone, who can cool it down 
 And make me feel like love is easy 
 If love is all you need, then let me hear you say 
 I need it, can't live without it 
 Can't play the game no more, so I'm doing something 'bout it 
 And I want it, yeah I'm on it 
 Searching far and wide to find the girl for me 
 Yeah 
 (Verse: Lloyd) 
 See, I've been so many places 
 I'm looking for the one who's for me 
 Then I fall in love, I wonder (then I fall in love I wonder) 
 Experienced so many relations but still I haven't found what I need 
 It's like I'm going under, it's so hard to breathe 
 Lord I'm tired of losing, I pray you send an angel down, to come and change my life around 
 Love is so confusing, can't seem to find a silent ground 
 Will somebody please show me how 
 (Chorus: Lloyd) 
 I don't want no party girl, sneaking over time 
 Just need me someone, who can cool it down 
 And make me feel like love is easy 
 If love is all you need, then let me hear you say 
 I need it, can't live without it 
 Can't play the game no more, so I'm doing something 'bout it 
 And I want it, yeah I'm on it 
 Searching far and wide to find the girl for me 
 Yeah 
 (Verse: Tyga) 
 It's times like this that make me really 
 Wonder 
 Who's the real bitch is and who the real 
 Fronters 
 Who the real image 
 And who this blocked number 
 Who would I call on collect in the prison for 
 One one couldn't tell me nothing 
 Who is this mystery person I called on 
 Can't get calls when your phones off 
 And the bills due 
 And the food gone 
 I need a shorty like lee ray 
 Who could wheel big bodies on the 
 Freeway 
 New merces through the palasays 
 Back to the pool palace where we can 
 Lay 
 Sleep all day shit this is my place 
 Ain't never gotta see a broke nigga face 
 When you feel alone just think of me 
 Sing along and just remember what the 
 Song say 
 (Chorus: Lloyd) 
 I don't want no party girl, sneaking over time 
 Just need me someone, who can cool it down 
 And make me feel like love is easy 
 If love is all you need, then let me hear you say 
 I need it, can't live without it 
 Can't play the game no more, so I'm doing something 'bout it 
 And I want it, yeah I'm on it 
 Searching far and wide to find the girl for me 
 Yeah
