(Intro/chorus:) 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell 
 I gotta make it (I gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 I gotta make it 
 I gotta make it 
 K-k-keep that's my mom flash 
 Right cash pretty girls nice ass 
 This bitch is bad 
 I dream of pockets of bands 
 But none in hand 
 Take pictures at the dealership 
 One day I'll buy that (buy that) biitch 
 Moving fast girl get on my lap 
 Wish on a star on everything he asked 
 Whenever there's trouble walla make those fingers snap 
 No magic out the hat tell baby bye bye I'm never coming back (coming back) 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 Never stop seeing violence 
 Police stopping what they won't do is for sirens 
 Loudmouths get silenced 
 I sure woulda what I've seen 
 Community grief 
 Figure your clean 
 They will drag money from your feet 
 Ogs mix their can coke with their henny 
 Omg put miles on the caprise 
 So their so their mouths could feed 
 They live through me 
 I'm the closest to TV 
 Who told you to change the channel 
 I was watching remote pleae 
 Niggas want things they can't have 
 This life'll let you touch things you can't grab 
 Explain it when you're buried man 
 Until death I take off then I land 
 Id be god damn 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 Heaven hell is it even real 
 Would you give up your life for this life 
 Heaven hell is it really real 
 Would you give up your life for this life 
 Thomas digging for you lab rats 
 And I'm a chemist with this mental this isn't rap 
 Bitch I don't even laugh 
 Bitch you can miss me with that gaval jack 
 All you judge jury niggas just an fake act 
 I'm somewhere getting my stage on 
 Black super shades on 
 Hey y'all ey y'all 
 Someone turn they swag on 
 I'm off the wrong room 
 So don't follow me home 
 Gotta learn (gotta learn) 
 How to walk (how to walk) 
 On your own (on your own) 
 (Chorus/outro:) 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it even if heaven or hell uh uh 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...) 
 I gotta make it (gotta make it gotta make it...)
