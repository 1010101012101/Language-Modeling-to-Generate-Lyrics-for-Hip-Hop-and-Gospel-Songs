Fire flow, let me fascinate 
 Put python seats, jake the snake 
 I rock bape, that bathin' grape 
 You fake the bape, that's pump fake 
 I ball on turf, that's chevy chase 
 That's caddyshack, don't be actin' shady 
 Lash out on the owner, nigga 
 Don't be harassin' my shorty, nigga 
 Borin' niggas, don't be borin', niggas 
 I'm the swag God in the holy temples 
 Spend 65k on my dental 
 Got the ripped denim, black card in 'em 
 3 Car garage, black cars in 'em 
 Need more space to put the rolls in it 
 Rollin' blunts for the fuck of it 
 I'm already high, I'm just talkin' shit 
 Shit on niggas like an eagle do 
 Give that bitch a break like an interlude 
 Bought a parachute, eatin' barracuda 
 I'm a barbarian rude nigga 
 With a ghetto gang and some pretty bitches 
 Walk on jimmy kimmel with some real killers 
 Real niggas, tommy hilfiger 
 This tommy gun my real hitta 
 Young nigga chillin' in the master suite 
 Ask me where I used to sleep 
 In the car parked on the street 
 Ask me what I used to eat 
 Mcdonalds like twice a week 
 Now I get served in my master suite 
 Just watched my bitch masturbate 
 Shit's milk, and it's sweet, nigga 
 Niggas sweet, I'm the candyman 
 Here I go again, can't get rid of me 
 I'm on sunset, now I'm overseas 
 Lost the lambo key, I just ordered 3 
 Mickey ds, played the 62 
 Red and yellow like ronald do 
 I'm hard to break like a rondo 2 
 Don't weigh a lot but I'll take your food 
 Face to face, she give me face 
 'Til her face's blue like hunnits, new 
 Spend 10k at mr. Chows 
 My mama proud, these niggas bow 
 That's tyga's style, you stole my style 
 You a hidden dragon, crouchin' tiger style 
 Jungle shit, my niggas wild 
 You a bitch, thinkin' out loud 
 I'm gamblin', my diamonds loud 
 My rollie face original 
 Look on your face like, nigga how 
 I came from nothin', had dreams of stuntin' 
 Never owned a porsche, so yeah I want it 
 Just to say I had it, now you can have it 
 Fuck y'all, I'm just livin' lavish 
 Rather die that nigga than to live average 
 Young nigga chillin' in the master suite 
 Ask me where I used to sleep 
 In the car parked on the street 
 Ask me what I used to eat 
 Mcdonalds like twice a week 
 Now I get served in my master suite 
 Just watched my bitch masturbate 
 Shit's milk, and it's sweet, nigga 
 Young nigga chillin' in the master suite 
 Ask me where I used to sleep 
 In the car parked on the street 
 Ask me what I used to eat 
 Mcdonalds like twice a week 
 Now I get served in my master suite 
 Just watched my bitch masturbate 
 Shit's milk, and it's sweet, nigga 
 Real niggas in my family tree 
 Rich niggas in my family tree, nigga 
 Bad bitches in my fantasies 
 That pussy good, and it's clean, nigga 
 Shit's milk, and it's sweet 
 Me and my bitch beauty and the beast 
 She a masterpiece
