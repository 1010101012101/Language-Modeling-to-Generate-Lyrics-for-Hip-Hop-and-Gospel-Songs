TYGA! 
 GED Army 
 Young Money navy 
 Fuck you, Pay me! 
 It's simple, ha ha 
 What happens when ya enemies, once friends and everything ends 
 My glory begins 
 Two miles from his house 
 A spot that they slung out 
 Lil kids play out 
 Shit foul in my town 
 They talk but want shout cause snitches neva be found 
 Just look straight 
 No squares around just quilts and cake 
 Half way growing age 
 Started seeing different ways 
 Illegally paid 
 Getting lawyers legally paid 
 I'm saying 
 Polaroid boy just want the fame 
 Never my image to betray but never soft like sulfate nicca 
 Nicca 
 I started from the very end 
 Look around look where I begin 
 Woman sittin' sippin with him 
 But what happens when the glory ends 
 What happens when the glory ends 
 What happens what happens then 
 What happens when the glory ends 
 And enemies once friend kiss my glory ends 
 Look at'em tyga slim skinny no pig 
 I don't fuck with them 
 Denver dens bitch no ticket shit 
 Here's a tab write it off my taxes 
 Get paid more than you faggots 
 My sun shine like I waxed it 
 Get backwards move forward get blasted 
 I'm Dave Matthews 
 Great figure this nigga asked it 
 Actually my swag mastered 
 Show the masters my taxes 
 Performing off like Julio bastards 
 Young graduate no degree with a bachelor 
 Pack full off cash 
 Look at the way I sag 
 Look at the balance on that natty hat 
 Match the Gucci bag 
 Wearing shit the store never had 
 Even dads is cool mothers love my ass 
 Them ghetto jags is threw I'm in the newest class 
 Limited edition no tints bitch see who in it 
 Now back the fuck up like strippers 
 Nicca 
 I hate his only motive 
 Scope my every slogan 
 Blog my every word 
 Rephrase shit I've spoken 
 The whole nine the truth is really unfolding 
 Couple Folgers if ya sleeping we gone wake ya owner 
 Hold ya like groceries no Kenneth Copeland 
 But I'm on some poor shit 
 Drug flow I'm close to dopest 
 Really singing this sick shit no nursery but row ya boat bitch 
 White phantom call it big toll whip 
 In motion an eagle colder than zero below 
 Don't pour motive hoes know what I D.O 
 Already put on a show from the day he was born 
 Through the form deform 
 Ima monster y'all 
 Jewelry look armor raw 
 The money monopoly born 
 The shit is fraud 
 And I don't play games you see what happen in that movie saw 
 But this is real life shootin no director
