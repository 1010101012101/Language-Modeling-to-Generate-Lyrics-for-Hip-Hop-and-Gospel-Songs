(Tyga Tyga you're burning bright) x3 
 (The darkness of the night) 
 *Background* 
 Everywhere I been 
 Every place I go 
 All got one thing in common 
 You see 
 They all call me by one thing 
 (Tyga Tyga) 
 At my shows as we roll and scream people see him and say 
 (Tyga Tyga) 
 I'm so nice gotta repeat me twice now everybody say 
 (Tyga Tyga) 
 Don't matter what those other groupies say I'm on my way 
 Yah I'm on my, I'm on my way... 
 (Paragon star it's Tyga Tyga y'all) 
 Both knuckles up demos in a duffel uhn 
 Bad colour sepia who said I ain't good for nothing? 
 Respect my hustlness Madames get to mumblin 
 'Cause I'm coming with coloured skin ask me what my momma thinks 
 Along to my beats these things compliments it's bad to see once laughed at me 'cause I had a dream 
 Now they wanna relax sit back with me 
 I recline the cline when they speak, no room to breath 
 Look in my eyes you see lies and truth 
 That defeat guys who sized life knee high see y'all 
 One day after I die niggas long ways 
 Got a strong case to demonstrate fore I elevate 
 As the swagga serenades I see evil hate turn for great and mission MIA 
 The non fake 
 Put a large cake on my plate with a lil' bass they scream and say say 
 *Chorus and Background* 
 How many marksmen do you know in the local projects? 
 How many niggas hold you down when the shit is started? 
 Been counted 
 That's why I ain't heavy mobbing 
 Got a low key crib cause bitch is retarded 
 Repeat in their head they with you 
 On some all day shit 
 They get me nauseous 
 Small apartment do all your dirty laundry 
 Cause word spreads to everybody and their aunties 
 No pretzels but shit is salty 
 Can't even trust the modders 
 You might spot em 
 Go hare and bone pop shit 
 Stop it 
 My details will leave a mosh pit 
 Honest this kid is... 
 *Chorus and Background* 
 On my way to the penthouse 
 Tend to the little mi-ha 
 Her friend like meet her 
 You don't know Tyga? 
 She don't really care about neither 
 Either I'm too far where her mind can't reach up 
 Or she don't like music making money niggas 
 I do note I don't got time and maneuvers 
 Like that voodoo 
 Like that you knew 
 Me don't 
 I'm already I high rap guru 
 Fume flew right past you 
 With something to mac in 
 And marry catholic accurate so exaggaitive 
 Average chicks think I'm not bagging em 
 I still go in I just love it when they call em. 
 *Chorus and Background*
