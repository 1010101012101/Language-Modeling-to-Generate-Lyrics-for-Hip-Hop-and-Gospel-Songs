(Intro - DJ Drama) 
 Let me let Active Hands talk 
 DJ Active 
 So you know there's no kitchen like our kitchen 
 I don't like that rare, I don't like that medium rare shit 
 Everything I make is well done baby 
 (Chorus - Tyga) 
 Tell them bitches I'm the man 
 Money over bitches nigga that's the plan 
 Everything I do well-well-well-well done hoe 
 Everything I do well-well-well-well done hoe 
 Niggas said they ballin', they in the stands 
 If it ain't about business, don't shake my hand 
 Everything I do well-well-well-well done hoe 
 Everything I do well-well-well-well done hoe 
 (Verse 1 - Tyga) 
 Pop a, motherfuckin' man 
 Walker clear the way, it's an ambulance 
 Fire truck get to the fire in advance 
 Hot flow I just 
 Pop a, motherfuckin' man 
 Walker clear the way, it's an ambulance 
 Fire truck get to the fire in advance 
 Hot flow I just I just gave the track a tan 
 Ain't a damn thing, we poppin' champagne 
 Girl say they choosin' rootin' for the other team 
 I put her in the 'vibe', like the magazine 
 You see it's rainin' hundreds, cash get the cream 
 The cream get the money, the money make her scream 
 Nothin' personal it was just a quick fling 
 But now I'm back to me, paper off the shelf bitch 
 She just wanna get drunk, get fucked, taste dick 
 Maybe make a new friend, get in Benz with him 
 This ain't no simple life, you dancin' with a star bitch 
 Yeah, so keep my spotlight bright 
 'Cause I'ma be in it all night 
 (Chorus - Tyga) 
 Tell them bitches I'm the man 
 Money over bitches nigga that's the plan 
 Everything I do well-well-well-well done hoe 
 Everything I do well-well-well-well done hoe 
 Niggas said they ballin', they in the stands 
 If it ain't about business, don't shake my hand 
 Everything I do well-well-well-well done hoe 
 Everything I do well-well-well-well done hoe 
 (Verse 2 - Tyga) 
 All about my paper ain't another feelin' greater 
 Came up like elevators, now I ball like a Laker 
 They like my freestyles, but they gon' have to pay me 
 Candy red 'Maro tell them bitches now or later 
 6 speed brand new car smell flavored 
 Look up in the sky, thank God that we major 
 It's tax to be made, world full of danger 
 So we gon' count it underneath the table to be safer 
 Ace paid in full, all hundreds big jewels 
 Stones kinda heavy, Slick Rick the rule 
 Gotti got a 'Nali, man the raws in the groups 
 See me Pauly out the roof 
 Son flyin' in the coupe 
 She love it 'cause the feelin' fuckin' on a million 
 Fly you in the mornin' right now, we chillin' 
 Stuck in the moment, then she back to her life 
 I'm back to the money, 'cause money my life 
 (Chorus - Tyga) 
 Tell them bitches I'm the man 
 Money over bitches nigga that's the plan 
 Everything I do well-well-well-well done hoe 
 Everything I do well-well-well-well done hoe 
 Niggas said they ballin', they in the stands 
 If it ain't about business, don't shake my hand 
 Everything I do well-well-well-well done hoe 
 Everything I do well-well-well-well done hoe
