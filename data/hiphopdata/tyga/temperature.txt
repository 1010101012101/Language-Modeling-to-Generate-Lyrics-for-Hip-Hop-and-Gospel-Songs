 Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise 
 Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise 
 The temperature, temperature 
 Yeah I, I could feel the temperature, temperature 
 I pick you up in a Bently truck, come outside 
 Hit me up when you need some downtime 
 Damn girl, it's about time 
 Off at 4, I want to see you around 5 
 Now I'm 4:45, I'll be on my way 
 Ya I'm on my way come outside 
 Baby girl, you're never that mine 
 I lost my watch and I still found time 
 Uh, girl you're hot and cold, that makes you warm 
 Let your ex-man stay in the storm 
 When you don't have to force it, it's a force 
 All I ever want is more 
 Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise 
 Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise 
 The temperature, temperature 
 Yeah I, I say I could get you so high 
 You might die if you fall, yeah 
 And what's left in the love if I gave you all of me, be patient 
 And when you need space, I give you a spaceship 
 Take all the space you need yeah 
 Face your freedom with the face 
 You still be mine 
 Before we lay we lie 
 I get you so wet, would you come clean, oh I 
 Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise 
 Yeah I know when you're outside, I could feel the temperature rise 
 The temperature, temperature 
 Yeah I, I say I could get you so high 
 You might die if you fall, yeah 
 Uh, girl you're hot and cold, that makes you warm 
 Let your ex-man stay in the storm 
 When you don't have to force it, it's a force 
 All I ever want is more 
 And I cannot protect you when you flex so far away

 Thought it would be cool to tell me what I thought of you 
 You're radiant, you're vibrate
