 I feel good 
 Got some time off, girl it's been so long 
 Did you have fun? 
 'Cause imma need a cab just to get me home 
 Maybe you could call in sick 
 Bring it to the crib and get all this dick 
 I know I'm blunt, but how real is that? 
 You want that feeling back? 
 (Tyga) 
 Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters 
 In time it's all better, 'cause time heal whatever 
 Imma need a moment cause moments last forever 
 Cars with cream leather, females are on regular 
 What's the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us? 
 I'd rather stay friends with benefits till we ready 
 Now ready, Sean done got me feeling heavy 
 She like one more chance, more problems, no biggie, ah 
 It's all good, don't take it the wrong way 
 Ain't nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face? 
 We can leave together or you can take your space 
 The night young, we should head over to my place 
 Ha, now we laughing and all that 
 Tell your friend they can fall back 
 Ain't even gotta ask twice 
 She said what you feeling like? 
 I'm like...

 Well you should know 
 I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
 I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
 I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
 And even though we let it go, it's better that you know 
 I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
 I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
 I still got it for ya, I still got it for ya 
 And even though we let it go, it's better that you know 
 I still... 
 (Tyga) 
 Ain't nobody like you 
 Heard you got a ball player 
 But he don't excite you 
 I ain't the one you gotta lie to 
 Lay down, relax, climax, let me guide you 
 Still a superfreak 
 You know how I be when I'm rolling in the streets 
 Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree 
 Just call me genuine 'cause I'm the same ol' g 
 We was young, full of insecurities 
 Grown up now, all we got is old memories 
 Used to be like enemies, arguing and clashing 
 Too much pride to say sorry 
 Shit, problems running like half the day 
 Number 24, let it fade away 
 She gotta leave but she wanna stay 
 She like "how you feeling babe?" 
 Like, shit
