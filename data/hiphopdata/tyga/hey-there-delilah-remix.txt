(Feat. Plain White T's) 
 Tyga: 
 If been thinking bout your flyness. 
 Dreamin' 'bout the first time we was viben. 
 On the phone sayin' the words love is silent. 
 But wow that chick 
 So stylish 
 Even made my drama your problems 
 And the equation you help me solve it 
 You've been there before the popular Tyga 
 I was not ballin 
 Plain White T's: 
 Oh It's What You Do To Me 
 Oh It's What You Do To Me 
 Oh It's What You Do To Me 
 Oh It's What You Do To Me 
 What You Do To Me 
 Hey There Delilah 
 Tyga: 
 Ouch feel like my heart is cryin 
 Cause your light years away from where I am 
 Well that's what it seems like Ms.Delilah 
 There's no other thing like a Ms.Delilah 
 This court outta divide me from Ms.Delilah 
 No I'm turnin' into a Mr.Violent 
 All 'cause I was sprung on Ms.Delilah 
 Now You See It 
 Plain White T's: 
 Oh It's What You Do To Me 
 Oh It's What You Do To Me 
 Oh It's What You Do To Me 
 Oh It's What You Do To Me 
 What You Do To Me 
 Tyga: 
 I'm on a freeway doin' 90 
 With police sirens behind me 
 Going to a place that you cannot find me 
 'Cause I'm through 
 No more me and you 
 Angel eyes but a devil in disguise 
 In this car 
 I'm dyin' cause of a cheating liar 
 But that's what you get fuckin' with Delilah 
 Plain White T's: 
 Oh It's What You Do To Me 
 Oh It's What You Do To Me 
 Oh It's What You Do To Me 
 Oh It's What You Do To Me 
 What You Do To Me
