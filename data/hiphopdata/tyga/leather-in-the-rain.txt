 My intuition is telling me, alright 
 My intuition tells me that you're getting in this whip with me 
 Tell me what you're into, we can get into it endlessly, get into it endlessly 
 See she can wear leather in the rain, she can find pleasure in pain 
 Say my name, say my name, say it, babe 
 See she can wear leather in the rain, she can find pleasure in pain, oh yeah 
 Say my name, say my name, say it, babe 
 She run me wrong, run, run me wrong, keep me, keep me coming 
 Yeah, I pull up on her bumper, let's get reckless, let's get reckless 
 Take it slow like we in Texas, take it to the island, ride her like a jetski, yeah 
 Baby, just let me if you're ready, let's see 
 If you think you're ready, let's see 
 If you think you're ready, let's see 
 Oh, ready, ready, yeah 
 Ready

 My intutition tells me you really not so innocent 
 And baby, the vibe that you're giving me's intentional, intentional 
 I can feel how intense it is, feel the intensity 
 See he can wear leather in the rain, he can find pleasure in pain 
 Say my name, say my name, say it, babe 
 See he can wear leather in the rain, he can find pleasure in pain, oh yeah 
 Say my name, say my name, say it, if nobody's around 
 Spend time with me, not money, so you keep me, keep me coming, coming 
 Pull up on my bumper, let's get reckless, let's get reckless 
 Hold me close, come to my rescue, take it to the islands, ride it like a jetski, yeah 
 Baby, just let me if you're ready, let's see 
 If you think you're ready, let's see 
 If you think you're ready, let's see 
 Oh, ready, ready, yeah 
 Ready 
 Oh, ready, ready, yeah 
 Ready
