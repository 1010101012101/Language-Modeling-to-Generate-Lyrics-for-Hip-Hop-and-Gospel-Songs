Better days, better days 
 Rollin' wit my "yeah so?" hat to the back 
 Oh, you ain't heard round town? 
 Young niggas strapped 
 Well Mike, 
 If you lose your life 
 There's no coming back 
 I've seen lots of lies 
 Fake smiles behind my back 
 But check yo 
 Check d check 
 Blaaaa 
 Bruise blues and black 
 Never trust a loud mouth 
 Mama taught me that 
 Don't live the lifestyle 
 Son, If you can't pay for that 
 But shit you gotta spend the money 
 To get money back 
 And hurry till they cash you 
 Pictures snap 
 Sirens flash 
 Fuck an officer with a badge 
 Lets see your license motherfucka 
 That I don't have 
 Not even half of these niggas 
 Have had half of what I had 
 But I still wish that...
