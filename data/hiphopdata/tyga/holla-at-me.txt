Uh, boom, boom 
 We ballin' in the room 
 Sweepin' up my competition call me mr. broom 
 Knockin' niggas over, call me bulldozer 
 One more drink for these niggas and it's over 
 'Cause I'm a strike that something like a cobra 
 I know she want my venom, but I ain't gon' leave it in her 
 And right after I get her, she know she with a winner 
 And we straight to the crib, I ain't takin' her to dinner 
 Ha, nigga look at my jewels 
 Aviator shades I ain't lookin' at you 
 Achoo, bless me twice 
 Be a rich nigga I be shittin' on your life 
 Magazine covers, magnem rubbers 
 I mean magnum, I don't fuck with stragglers 
 Niggas want drama, gangsta grill bastards 
 Did you check the caption lights camera action 
 Holla at me boo, holla at me beh [x3] 
 I'm turn't up, I'm super turn't up [x2] 
 (Repeat) 
 A nigga beat, beat 
 And shawty toot, toot 
 Blowin' out their brains, car need a new roof 
 Lookin' like a superstar, when I roll through 
 And shawty I'm the truth, so mama what it do 
 Now let's ride out, ain't no trippin' 
 When we dippin' to my hideout 
 Big dipper 'cause you sippin' on my bottle 
 Only fuckin' with them a-listin' models 
 Now let's get it like 
 Low did it, if you done it 
 Then I did it 
 If you kick it 
 Then I'm with it 
 We can do this shit all night 
 Your minute don't compare to my limit 
 When I'm in it and I get it 
 I'm a give it to you all night 
 I'm the shit, yeah I go hard 
 Don't stand in lines nigga I bogart 
 Fat boy celebrity 'cause I'm so large 
 And don't need no battery 'cause I'm in charge 
 Holla at me boo, holla at me beh [x3] 
 I'm turn't up, I'm super turn't up [x2] 
 (Repeat)

 Niggas swag jack, but this l.a. shit

 Snap back them ain't even rare where the tag a what 
 Wack ass all up in my ear bitch bag back

 Get your camera out uh, one flash 
 Hot beams steady shot clap your ass

 Patron top wash straight from the liquor store
