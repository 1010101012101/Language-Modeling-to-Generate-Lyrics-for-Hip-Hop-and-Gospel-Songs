Wont live forever 
 But almost everybody 
 Wants to live forever 
 Until they realize they 
 Wont live forever 
 But almost everybody 
 Wants to live forever 
 Once upon a time, rhyming, working at part time 
 Designers pricing it too high, I'm just trying to be fly 
 Categorized, closet full of Louis, 'cause da hundreds fluent 
 Who knew we doin' there's more to this youtube money, chewing 
 Review my struggle to it, rockiest roads, 
 And ice cream 'cause environments around me endangering 
 Never knew it too busy sharp shooting 
 Little fishes don't get caught by this harpoon bitch 
 Just music meet my instruments 
 OG say get your loose leafs, think in the margin kid 
 Never be too big for the littlest ship 
 Ripken, for clowns who don't think the Cal hit shit 
 Or how gangsta it gets when you don't portray the images 
 Remembering Pac's last picture 
 In the back of my mind stuck since September, nah I six you niggas 
 If you there, enter knock before I switch ya agenda 
 Body temperature zero, spirit missing, I should have listened 
 Wont live forever 
 But almost everybody 
 Wants to live forever 
 Until they realize they 
 Wont live forever 
 But almost everybody 
 Wants to live forever 
 Somebody body by that neighborhood party 
 Now he hot and street mama want answers but we remain in silent 
 No we glade it, cremate it, funeral, play the violins 
 What a sad time it is, society ran by communists 
 Obama that could improve how sick I am 
 Conglomerant diamonds shinin, show I got the upper hand, 
 Fuck the middle man, current discussions with the president 
 And the PM with the baddest bitch AM I am Uncle Sam 
 Kids, Nephew, I'm more on some father shit 
 Good nigga but don't follow him like simon says 
 You ain't it, but I'm playing tag again, destined to be big 
 Greatest ever player, I'm in this game to fucking win 
 School skipped gym, I rather get gems, dead faces on my marble table 
 Coppin' shit you are not able, I static it like bad cable 
 Get mashed, choir threwin, potato that choir sing, he won't make it 
 Wont live forever 
 But almost everybody 
 Wants to live forever 
 Until they realize they 
 Wont live forever 
 But almost everybody 
 Wants to live forever 
 Finally found the comedy, niggas title me 
 Got rid of the small quantity, now I'm killing 
 Its such an irony when you weigh the same height as me but afraid to say hi to me 
 Goodbye to the beats, beauty lies in passenger seats 
 Of each flat black SUV tinted for the celebrator driver GED chauffeurin 
 I'm... sorry for reincarnating the lord 
 Hence scars cover my pores safari with Tyga aboard 
 Horse bitches back it up, all 'cause they seen the bucks 
 Counting 1,2,3,4 like Ray Allen was 
 Balances looking like Hammer's funds, past not present 
 Dumb fucks getting drugged up, I probably bet ya fuckin' luck 
 You wont get higher than us, status of a Jordan jump 
 Ya swaggers off a mannequin, my shit randomly tough 
 Nigga what? I die a today, at least I live it up 
 You losers don't even know what you living for nigga c'mon 
 Wont live forever 
 But almost everybody 
 Wants to live forever 
 Until they realize they 
 Wont live forever 
 But almost everybody 
 Wants to live forever
