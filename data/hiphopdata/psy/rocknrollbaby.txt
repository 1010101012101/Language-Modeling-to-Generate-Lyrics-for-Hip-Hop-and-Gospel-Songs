If time can't wait then I can't wait 
 Let's not hesitate, let's celebrate 
 If time can't wait then I can't wait 
 Let's not hesitate, let's celebrate, celebrate 
 머리 위로 만세 흔들어 밤새 
 지금부터 날새 everybody 열려라 참깨 
 잔을 위로 건배 제발 가지마 집에 
 Been there, done that, I don't give a fun baby 
 We've gotta go, we're in a hurry 
 We're going crazy, don't worry 
 We drink till our vision get blurry 
 Body get hotter than curry 
 Shit's on fire like burn it up 
 Shit so loud like turn it up 
 Everybody came they turnt up 
 Shit so hot, we turnt up 
 If time can't wait then I can't wait 
 Let's not hesitate, let's celebrate 
 If time can't wait then I can't wait 
 Let's not hesitate, let's celebrate 
 Hey, tell me you know what I'm saying 
 망설일 시간에 우리 달리자고 달리자 hey 
 달리자 hey 달리자 hey 
 Rock 'n' roll baby 
 Baby, baby, don't stop 
 Rock 'n' roll baby 
 Baby, baby, don't stop 
 Rock 'n' rock 'n' roll 
 I just wanna rock this party 
 I-I-I just wanna rock 
 (Rock 'n' roll baby) 
 I just wanna rock this party 
 I-I-I just wanna rock 
 (Rock 'n' rock 'n' roll) 
 지금부터 단 둘이 둘이 합치면 짜파구리 
 수리수리 마수리 baby, baby, come shake that booty 
 흔들흔들 이건 어른들의 놀이 완전 꿀잼잼 도리도리 
 고래고래 질러봐 너의 소리 come and get me 쌀보리 쌀보리 
 Killing this party like a soldier 
 Keep this crazy composure 
 Stay so cool I'm colder 
 Colder than the mother-mother polar 
 Shake that booty, baby don't stop 
 Shake it from the bottom, shake it to the top 
 You know I won't stop 'cause I can't stop 
 You know I won't stop 'cause I can't stop 
 If time can't wait then I can't wait 
 Let's not hesitate, let's celebrate 
 If time can't wait then I can't wait 
 Let's not hesitate, let's celebrate 
 Hey, tell me you know what I'm saying 
 망설일 시간에 우리 달리자고 달리자 hey 
 달리자 hey 달리자 hey

 젖먹던 힘까지 다 써 남김 없이 
 지를 대로 질러봐 거리낌 없이 
 아직 끝난게 아니야 한 번 더 rock it
