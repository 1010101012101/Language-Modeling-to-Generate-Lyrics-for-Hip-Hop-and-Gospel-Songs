My music make the crowd move 
 I'm in the car rolling cow food 
 But I still keep a strap wit me, 
 I ain't never been a slipper that's a house shoe 
 Got my education without school 
 Quiet as a mouse move 
 But I keep a loud tool 
 Play games you'll be shitting in a pouch fool 
 Got stock like Dow do 
 New hardtop 
 Off the car lot 
 Hit the gas tires smoke like cigar shops 
 Make ya jaw drop 
 Bought it off the narc cops 
 Tax on the work we got them H and R blocks 
 Alumni yeah I'm from the school of hard knocks 
 Looking out for the twelve Roger Staubach 
 No cafe but we had them hard rocks 
 For the bread they'll throw you off of dark docks 
 So before ya heart stop 
 Or the narcs knock 
 I gotta give it to you straight like a bar shot 
 'Cause the streets don't play fair 
 Niggas mad 'cause you got more rides than the state fair 
 Terrified I can't lie boy I stay scared 
 So I keep a lotta toys like a day care 
 Hold the shotty like a bass player 
 I ain't a killer I'm just trying to stay safe player 
 It was my only wish to rise 
 It was my only wish to rise 
 On them jealous motherfuckers I despise 
 Coming down clean bumping riding dirty getting high 
 It was my only wish to rise 
 On them jealous motherfuckers I despise 
 Coming down clean bumping riding dirty getting high 
 It's a mystery break out ya magnifying glasses 
 Wit ya hat and fine jackets 
 Macs and iron ratchets 
 Asinine bastards big as packs of line backers 
 Pussy fat wit fine asses in the back wit lines asking 
 Who dat on that new track wit that rap reclined backwards 
 I knew that it was you but matta fact don't mind asking 
 Cooling on em 
 Moving on em 
 My shooters on em 
 Show this flow off like a trophy and a new diploma 
 Graduation 
 Crackers say that I wasn't gon make it 
 Pack of paper 
 Pen and pad and now calculate it 
 Malcolm made it 
 Cinematic and black related 
 Addicts and crack and bases 
 My status is cracking faces 
 Embarrassing cracking vases 
 At the dinner party 
 I took no slow classes baby but yes I been retarded 
 You see my folks acting crazy like it's in kindergarten 
 I'm bringing heat like old ladies when they is menopausing 
 Yeah 
 Been at the lowest of my lows 
 That's why I get high hoping no one ever know 
 To open up my mind I can show you what I wrote 
 Or rather show you how to boat 
 And hope that you can live or float 
 Independently self made 
 And well paid 
 Three whips one chain no welt pain 
 When you treeing over niggas they gon yell shade 
 They outta patience where I live 'cause they sell weight 
 Avoided the temptation of crack slinging 
 But Lincoln park had it looking like back in the eighties 
 Now partners getting broads and the hottest whips 
 And I was sweating hours trying to get the illest scholarship 
 Ain't have a pot to piss 
 I wasn't born rich 
 When I be writing I'm as hungry as a model bitch 
 She got the fattest ass they got the hottest look 
 Leaving wit eight bitches I need some octopus 
 See how wale go j four cs 
 My lake shore whore never be on the bs 
 Bullshit chi town 
 Riding around 
 Top down 
 Hanging with the squares will be the reason niggas not around 
 What it do 
 Penny phones all blue 
 Or you could prolly use a nigga drive welcome to my car pool 
 Yellow lam g shit 
 She double od shit 
 Five time foul niggas need to stop reaching 
 High as fuck with my down ass 
 Bitch roll to the Porsche from the bus pass 
 But got lost when me and the cash crossed paths 
 Indo smoke out my nose no mustache 
 Bitches I want but that money is a must have 
 Fuck is you drunk? 
 Pay that up front 
 Like the Ferrari trunk 
 Be careful you won't 
 Have to be sorry hon 
 Stay close to the G's and you might learn sum'n 
 Might earn sum'n 
 Chop it up like mobsters on the rooftop let you burn sum'n 
 Stop talking so much 
 Soak it up next time you have sum'n to say 
 Boss the fuck up 
 Butcher knives done died trying to be as sharp as us 
 Talking 'bout you on yo way 
 See them niggas downstairs 'fore you talk to us 
 By appointments no walk ups
