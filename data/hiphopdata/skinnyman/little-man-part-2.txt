(Out of this room, out of this place, you know; back into the world. 
 It's your fuckin' world mate, not mine, you can stick it up ur arse, I don't wan' it!) 
 Now you bin tru the worst years, jail for years 
 And had to come face 2 face with the worst of your fears 
 Seen blood shed and sweaty old soldiers shed tears 
 If you cudn't stand the bang up with the maddest, the brers 
 Let 'em hang up, slit your wrist, nobody cares 
 Did you ever feel that there was duppies round you every where? 
 Dats rite blud, Ru gna take your life blud? 
 There's no beta place and tonites the night blud 
 Before you tie your neck on that pipe blud 
 Jus pass all your tings out the window, and swing 'em to the right blud 
 Rite blud? 
 Fuckin' wid dis ting called life blud 
 I've never bin the one whose ever bin the rowdy type blud 
 From I was a nut gettin' bust, I had to fight blud 
 And I can't see myself tryna giv up on life blud 
 Not light blud 
 I really wana see the light blud 
 I mean I wana fix up, and make tings rite blud 
 Now I wana fix my life blud 
 I mean I wana make tings rite blud 
 And see dat light blud. 
 (Well, those are your options, and you've created 'em, you've brought it all upon yourself... 
 Before you kick another door down, or you kick another chef in the bollocks)
