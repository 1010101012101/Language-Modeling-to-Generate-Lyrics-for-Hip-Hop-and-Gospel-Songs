Now I'm a family man that works hard for the money 
 With the sweetest wife ever *smak* I love you honey 
 I buy her everything, if it takes my last dollar 
 Even her nails and her hair to be done at the beauty parlor 
 We spend ample time together, doin' dinner and a movie 
 And whatever else sounds groovy 
 And when we want real excitement and drama, word to momma 
 We walk around in our pajamas in the Bahamas 
 I love her and I need her and I never ever cheat her 
 I'm far too carin to be considered a woman beater 
 My style is gentle, romantic and friendly 
 Nothin' like the husband from _Sleeping With the Enemy_ 
 I thought that she was in love with me 
 I used to think that she couldn't get enough of me 
 But lately things been seemin strange and... 
 Baby you changed
