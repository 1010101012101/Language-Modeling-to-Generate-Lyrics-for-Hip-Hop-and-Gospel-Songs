(Big Daddy Kane) 
 Move over bacon there's somethin' meatier 
 A natural born lover with love to give free to ya 
 Meatier, so all you bacon lovers move over 
 'Cause I'm so smooth they should call me Blackanova 
 I'm not tryin' to say that I'm number one 
 I'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done 
 So, let me lick you from head to toe 
 Realllllllll slowwwwwwwww 
 Cause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung 
 Just by the movement of my tongue 
 I remember it all started way back 
 In ummm... Kindergarten! 
 Some played with Lego's, some played with Play-Doh 
 But I was feelin' girls like a ripe tomato 
 And now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk 
 Lockin up girls like I want 
 Yes I got a harem, but I don't share em 
 I collect 'em like padium and MMM, you gotta see em 
 Because the ladies is all I dream of 
 And not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love 
 You know why?
