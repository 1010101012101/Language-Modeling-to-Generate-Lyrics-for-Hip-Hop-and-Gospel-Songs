One-fifty-eight Lewis Avenue 
 Between Lafayette and Van Buren, that was back during 
 The days of hangin' on my Bed-Stuy block 
 With Spence and Mitch, followin my cousin Murdoch 
 All the brothers were real, goin' for what they feel 
 By the way, peace to my man Sha and Big Neal 
 Now in ninety-three I'm still bein me 
 You think my 'fridgerator ain't full of Olde E? Huh 
 A lot of times I get fly with a suit and a tie 
 Yeah I went from rags to riches but I still rock the saggy britches 
 And I don't try to act brand new 
 Eatin escargots and usin' words like "rendezvous" 
 The ghetto life I've seen a lot overcome 
 Make a little money and then forget where they came from 
 Livin' a plastic lifestyle, you're more false than dentures 
 Don't make me pull your file -- stop shammin!
