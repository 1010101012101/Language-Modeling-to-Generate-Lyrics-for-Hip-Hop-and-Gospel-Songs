(Big Daddy Kane) 
 People people, we gotta get over 
 Before we go under, and I wonder 
 Why we can't find a little piece of mankind 
 Instead of always step back, gimme my damn nine 
 Livin' the thug, like the shoot up the drug type 
 They love to hear the people sayin', "Yo that kid is bugged right?" 
 Just a game, so please, out here men die 
 The average black man today don't make it to see twenty-five 
 Cause someone else got the clock rocked 
 Tryin' to get the neighborhood locked, to be the new man on the block 
 But if you asked me who's the man I'm like, "You tell me? 
 I don't know, Ed Lover, Dr. Dre and Heavy D?" 
 I got my mind on comin' up, if not in first place 
 Then damnit I plan to be the first runner up 
 But it seems, I got a lot of problems under my belt 
 And everday I gotta ask myself
