 (Big daddy kane) 
 Livin' in the world of ghetto life 
 Shot with the gun, get you cut with the knife 
 That's the story yo, the way the peeps like to move 
 No fakin the funk, it's all about how to show and prove 
 Some get to make it through life livin' legal 
 The others gotta try to survive, doin' the evil 
 That men do, peace to every hood that I been through 
 I even got love for my homies in south central 
 But to the east my brother, cause that's where I stay at 
 Runnin' through the streets like a stray cat 
 Like that good times show it makes me go 
 Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, hmmmmmmmmmm, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 
 Up in the projects, it gets no iller 
 With true gue-rillas, and stone cold killers 
 It seems that every night, you get to hear the fireworks 
 As much as I hate, to see my people die or hurt 
 It's just a street mentality, a reality 
 Neighborhood warfare, that brings home casualties 
 And just because I moved out the residence 
 It don't mean that I can't represent 
 Chorus: kane + "yeah! yeah!" -> chanted in back throughout 
 So to my peeps in the pj's, throw your hands in the air 
 [Rick] "for all of y'all.." 
 Let me know you're out there 
 To my peeps in the pj's, throw your hands in the air 
 [Rick] "for all of y'all.." 
 Let me know you're out there 
 And to my peeps in the pj's, throw your hands in the air 
 [Rick] "for all of y'all.." 
 And let me know you're out there 
 Ah to my peeps in the pj's, throw your hands in the air 
 [Rick] "for all of y'all.." 
 And let me know you're out there 
 (Big daddy kane) 
 I'm runnin' mob deep around the way 
 It's me and the crew, we're tryin' to map out the day 
 Yo what's the haps on how we gettin' snaps? 
 Are we gonna shoot some cee-lo, or play a game of craps? 
 Matter fact, shane, ring the intercom 
 And see if you can get ten dollars from my moms 
 Tell her to throw it out the window if she got it to spare 
 Cause the elevator's broke, and I ain't checkin' for the stairs 
 And do me a solid, run to the store shorty 
 And pick me up some olde e, but not a 40 
 Just a two-two of brew will do, so I can knock it out fast 
 To make the coldness last 
 (Scoob) 
 And while you at man see where'd your friend go (word) 
 He shoulda been back a hour ago with the indo (yeah) 
 (Big daddy kane) 
 And meet us in the back park to get sparked 
 So I can be toasted by time it gets dark 
 Aiyyo jay, I see that bulge in the back of your jeans 
 Hope that's the God you now, know what I mean? 
 'Cause if somebody brings the noise, I'ma make it a silent movie 
 So take the safety off the toolie 
 'Cause I don't want no beef, nah baby 
 The only thing I wanna do is parrrrrrlay 
 Peace and harmony is what I relate to 
 But damn man, drama's just in the nature 
 (Big daddy kane) 
 I send this out to the homies in the hood 
 That stood by my side, to help a brother do good 
 Just like swv you was right here 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we in there 
 From all thugs that flex with all the muscle 
 Down to the brothers, that got a swift hustle 
 Like good golly miss three card molly, a neat trick 
 Where people get beat quick 
 Wanna see a sweet vic? 
 (Card shark) 
 Jackety jack, blackety black 
 You get nuttin back, and that's a fact 
 The sweetest game I ever seen 
 All you gotta do is find the red queen 
 Just point to it, can anybody point to it? 
 I play by the point of the finger of the hand 
 "The one in the middle! the one in the middle!" 
 That's black, you get no money back! 
 (Kane: aww man! see, I told you!)
