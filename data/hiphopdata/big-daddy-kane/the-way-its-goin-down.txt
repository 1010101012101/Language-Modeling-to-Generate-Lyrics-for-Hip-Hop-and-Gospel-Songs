Hit me, baby (that's right) 
 Hurt me, baby (that's right) 
 That-that-that funk 
 That-that-that-that- 
 That-that's-that's funkdafied-like fonk 
 That's that retarded-like fonk 
 Like you put your armpits in a drum machine 
 Good god 
 Break me off some of that 
 Come on 
 Easy mo, just let the beat rock from your sweet stock 
 To bounce the complete block, make everyone on the street flock 
 To this here rhymthm, music'll hit em, get em, my lyrics'll fit em 
 When I get with em, girls I'm in em, smokin' like bags of ism 
 The one that keep amazin y'all, don't even know who you're facin, pa 
 The kane has flipped more tracks than a racing car 
 The one who created it and many others imitated it 
 I heard your rap style, kid - hated it 
 Let me show you how, look here, now check my style 
 What I spit out, it'll raise your brow, make you say wow 
 Ba-da-bow-bow, come on, now let's get down 
 And sway, sway when you hear the music play 
 Hip-hop hooray, this is what I want you to say 
 Hey 
 I'm in love with big daddy kane 
 He makes the party swing 
 He turns the mother out 
 And rips apart things 
 Then I go... 
 Da-da-da-da-da 
 Yeah, I like the way it sound 
 And I love the way it's goin' down 
 Da-da-da-da-da 
 You know I like the way it sound 
 And I just love the way it's goin' down 
 Now, what's this b.s. you're sayin'? 
 And don't try to act like martin now with all that 'i was just playin' 
 No need to grief or mourn cause now the beef is on 
 Boom-bow-boo-bow-bow - kid, your teeth is gone 
 Just cause you rap that don't mean that you catchin wreck with me 
 You step to this, I give you mic-o-vasectomy 
 I only know one person that can come next to me 
 No, that's a tattle 
 'Cause I can't count my own shadow 
 A battle? I gots to have it 
 Unless you're gonna rob me like they give riddick a win for chavez 
 Cause tryin' to go against the kane rappin' 
 Is like a pimp tryina pull a nun - ain't nothin' happenin' 
 Clear the way for the one, champion, true black don 
 Gun gettin' the job done take a look, hon 
 Back up, son, you know you can't get none 
 Come on, I'm on a whole other level of rap 
 And it's like that, now show me where the party at 
 Da-da-da-da-da 
 Yeah, I like the way it sound 
 And I love the way it's goin' down 
 Da-da-da-da-da 
 You know I like the way it sound 
 And I love the way it's goin' down 
 The b-i-g d-a-d-y, no, back up and add another d 
 Come back to the k to the a to the 'n' to the e 
 Live from new york, the one and only 
 I give it to you raw for my homies 
 And to the ladies: I take 'em lookin' somethin' fine 
 It don't mind if we bump 'n' grind 
 If you're with me, jump in line 
 Because if in my wallet I can find one prophylactic 
 Then you better believe, girl, that you're gonna get your ass dicked 
 Hard type of rappers extinct like a dinosaur 
 The kind you saw rhyme before 
 But now you never find no more 
 Steppin to the kane with some drama to be startin 
 Because I put 'em all on ice like tonya harding 
 Back up, boy, I got the whole convoy 
 Rollin' with me on a mission that's to seek and destroy 
 So, to all the people that's been tryin' to talk about me 
 You better change your name to 5000 'cause you're audi 
 And if you bring on your crew, I'm steppin to them too 
 Just put the beat on and watch how I swing through 
 The groove, with more style than a backstroke 
 Drivin' past my competition like cab drivers do black folks 
 That's the way I move, I always stayed a smooth 
 Operator with data watin for you to play a groove 
 To turn it out without a doubt and show what I'm about 
 Good lookin', brooklyn, yeah, we in the house
