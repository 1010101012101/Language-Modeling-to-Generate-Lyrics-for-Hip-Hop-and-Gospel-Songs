Somebody tell me who's that, what's that 
 It's the man with the silk drawers stuck up his buttcrack 
 Don't even front and try to ask who is this 
 Cause my name rings more bells than a Jehovah Witness 
 Stronger than Listerine, moppin up rappers like Mr. Clean 
 Oh Lord, the Kane just hit the scene 
 Booyaka bo buck, rappers have no luck 
 'Cause when I come through, I'm catchin wreck, like a tow truck 
 Cause ain't no way in the world the Kane could ever, fade 
 I'm stayin on top of this thing, in order for me to get, paid 
 And anyone comin' to me for a battle is gettin', slayed 
 Whenever it comes to the lyrics I'm rappin' I got it, made 
 So back up off me, cause yo' rap 
 Have no hap' so slow dat and act like you know dat 
 Cause you can dream about bein this up to par 
 But not even Johnny Mathis can tell you what your chances are 
 Competition I'll drill em, and definitely outskill em 
 To make the long story short, I kill em 
 'Cause I face 'em like Jason, bizarre 
 And when I come through, it's like tchk tchk ah
