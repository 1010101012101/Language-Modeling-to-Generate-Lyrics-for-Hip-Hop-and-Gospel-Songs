C'mon... * echoes * 
 Swing your partner, I'm about to start the 
 Dance across the land, the Kane will scar the 
 People of our community, 'cause we're soon to see 
 The future of the world to be without unity 
 So brothers and sisters, let's check our history 
 To reveal what's been hidden a mystery 
 Because we're headed for self-destruction 
 And you know that the government, doesn't give a (fuck) when 
 One black brother sells another one dope 
 And he can't cope, so he dies without hope 
 Many of us live on this level 
 Mislead victims who dance with the devil
