 My my my my my my my my my 
 This must be what you call, love at first sight 
 When you commit yourself to someone 
 And don't even know wrong from right (wrong from right) 
 Looks like my feelings been united with you baby 
 But maybe just a little bit too soon 
 I realized that hearts get broken, sweetheart 
 I couldn't stand the wound (can't stand the wound) 
 So I put mines in your hands girl 
 And it's all yours my dear 
 But you got to be gentle, 'cause it's fragile see 
 That means handle with care (handle with care) 
 Heh, reminisce on how I first met you 
 You remember -- backstage at my show 
 I thought that I was the star until I saw you 
 (But I did not love her) (I did not love her) 
 Escapin from the crowd to be alone witchu 
 'Cause I had oh so much to say 
 As we sat down in my dressin room girl, huh 
 And just talked the entire night away 
 From that moment on I felt that I knew you 
 Just like the back of my hand (I love you, I love you) 
 Loved you like I never loved another (I loved you) 
 And dreamt of bein your man
