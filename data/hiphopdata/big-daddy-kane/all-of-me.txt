 (Big Daddy Kane) 
 You know B.W. I've heard it said 
 That a woman is a man's greatest gift 
 (Barry White) 
 Sure you're right 
 (Big Daddy Kane) 
 And success ain't nothin' unless you have someone to share it with 
 (Barry White) 
 Mmmmm, so true, so true 
 I've always felt that... it's great to achieve in life 
 Not having someone other than yourself to share it with it is, uh... 
 (Big Daddy Kane) 
 Sho' YOU'RE right 
 (Barry White) 
 ... Quite sad 
 (Big Daddy Kane) 
 In my case, I may have found someone (mmm) 
 I want, all, of that someone 
 (Barry White) 
 Yeah, I know what you mean 
 Well I'll tell you my friend 
 Just, communicate with her 
 And always say what you mean and mean what you say 
 Because, it's her that you want... all of me 
 Aoww 
 ... 
 (Big Daddy Kane) 
 Come here baby 
 Come bring ALL of you to me 
 When I say I want all of you 
 I mean I want all of you from your head to your feet (mmm) 
 I wanna taste everything from your lipstick to your toenail polish 
 (Barry White) 
 C'mere Kane brother 
 (Big Daddy Kane) 
 I want you... I want you... 
 I want to hold you, I want to massage you 
 I want to comfort you, I want to sooth... you (mm!) 
 You know the way you're standin still there 
 I just wanna lay on the floor and make love to your shadow 
 (A-heh) Sounds silly don't it? 
 (Barry White) 
 Not really 
 (Big Daddy Kane) 
 But for real, let me come on over there 
 Run my fingers through your hair 
 Hold your Nair, and undo that brassiere 
 My dear 
 (Barry White) 
 Daddy Kane

 Oh
