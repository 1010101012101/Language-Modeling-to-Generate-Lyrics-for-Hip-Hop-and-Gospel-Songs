(Big Daddy Kane) 
 Ready willin' and able 
 Here comes the new modern day Dark Gable 
 On the mattress and on the boxsprings 
 Girls, they wanna sport me like bamboo earrings 
 The go-getter, the skins-hitter 
 And if your girl says she met me... I probably did her 
 Word up, the sex super stud 
 I jump your bones like ten Crips against one Blood 
 (NASTY!) The N-A-S-T-Y 
 Ready for action if you wanna see why 
 So come on, and let's do this 
 As I, tiptoe through your tu-lips 
 Like Moses, I part them legs like the Red Sea 
 And then I plant somethin' deadly 
 Poundin and poundin, is how I'm servin' this 
 Makin' it look like, your bed is goin' through turbulence 
 Lots of lust, between the two of us 
 The sign on my Jimmy says, "Kidney's or bust," so 
 I shove deeper than the voice of Barry 
 To make you hit high notes like Mariah Carey 
 It's like a Morris Day jerkout 
 To put you in more positions than a Jane Fonda workout 
 I'm ready to tear down walls 
 You say let's chill, but to hell with that, 
 I'm not Aaron Hall, so... 
 Chorus: repeat 4X
