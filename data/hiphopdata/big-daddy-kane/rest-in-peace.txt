(Preacher) 
 Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today 
 For this somber occasion 
 Please join us in the mourning of this U-47 
 It was a great microphone in it's day 
 Until it met it's fate 
 One evening while it was in the studio 
 It was struck by the lyrical force of the Big Daddy Kane 
 So ashes to ashes, and dust to dust 
 May this microphone, rest, in peace... 
 (Big Daddy Kane) 
 Knock knock, guess who? Yes, ooh 
 The Bigger the B, the Iggah the I, 
 The Jigga the G is comin' through 
 Yes I'm the one with clout, they're all talkin' bout 
 To be frank, I have the flavor like sauerkraut 
 The microphone assassinator and furthermore 
 I murdered plenty rappers and believe that I'll murder more 
 So if you ask to give the Kane a go 
 You better treat me like drugs, and Just Say No 
 Because I utilize my skills to brutilize 
 And in a battle, man you should see what I do to guys 
 Whenever the mic's mine, I'll rock a hype rhyme 
 And come off, like dirty panties at nighttime 
 Cause any mic that I caress, I finesse 
 With zest, and just bless, best yet to progress 
 King Asiatic, no other rapper stands this 
 You couldn't be a King if you played hockey in Los Angeles 
 I gets pi-daid, top gri-dade, gotta admit ey 
 Point blank, the kid's stri-daight 
 'Cause when it comes to R-A-P-P-I-N, huh 
 I got it locked up like a bullpen
