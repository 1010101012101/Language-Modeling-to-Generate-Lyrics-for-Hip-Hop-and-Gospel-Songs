Things been said, plenty rumors been spread 
 Many many many new jacks got it in they head 
 That they can raise up on this and put the Kane in fright 
 Heheh... yeah right! 
 Listen, you're just as soft as baby powder 
 Don't let your mouth get you in somethin' 
 Your rhymes can't get you out of 
 Some good advice is don't even come out my way 
 You better press up on Chucky if you're lookin' for Child's Play 
 'Cause I'm a grown ass man in total command 
 One of the best to ever be and 
 No other can ever take a stand 
 When I kick a verse the scene becomes so scary 
 That niggaz get quiet like a library 
 I pick up the mic like a hunter in hot pursuit 
 Oh you want some of this? Then put that mic on mute 
 Because you'll be in more danger than Penelope Pitstop 
 Point blank, you get your shit dropped 
 I got a death blow whenever I throw 
 With double impact to take out the whole row 
 Huh, I start swingin' again and again 
 You'll hear so many "ooh ahhs" you'll think it was Boyz II Men 
 I break down, shake down, proceed down, beat down 
 Back down, smack down, rip down, get down 
 Showdown, throwdown, rundown, come down! *DJ rewinds* 
 Here's a little message for your own concern 
 You try to press up on this and get burned 
 A battle with a non-believe is what I yearn 
 Damn, niggaz never learn
