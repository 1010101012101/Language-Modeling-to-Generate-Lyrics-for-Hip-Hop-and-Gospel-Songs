On and on and on and on 
 Me say the beat don't stop until the break of dawn 
 Nor does the growth of our young world 
 Yes the children, be buildin, each boy and girl 
 Cause you are the cream of the planet earth 
 The new birth, now take that for what it's worth 
 And give the child room, to blossom and bloom 
 Livin' large, it's your destiny to consume 
 To take flight and ignite to a brand new height 
 Cause that's your goal in life - am I right? (Yeah!) 
 To start reachin', come on each and every 
 Single one of y'all comprehend what I'm teachin 
 I said listen up, listen up, listen up youngster 
 Learn from a lesson that the Big Daddy brung ya 
 It's nothin' but knowledge, I shall bring to you 
 And I'm not Mr. Rogers or Captain Kangaroo, but I know
