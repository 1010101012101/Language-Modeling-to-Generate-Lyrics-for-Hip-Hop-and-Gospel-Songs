(Kane) 
 Swing, you get up and dance and do your own thing 
 'Cause I got the groove to make your eardrums ring 
 And I bring this, to all the party people that demand most 
 Funky as Parliament, smooth as Luther Vandross 
 I wouldn't present myself to you as somethin' that sound nervous 
 You want it to be live, so here it is at your service 
 The B the I the G the D-A-double-D-Y 
 And when it comes to rippin the mic, oh my oh my oh my 
 I guarantee you by time I'm through 
 You gotta give me more props than a Motown Revue 
 And if you thinkin' this groove would ever come to an end 
 Hah, not from a hair off my chinny chin chin 
 Chorus: repeat 2X
