Manslaughter, walkin' on water 
 I stay afloat with a note, the way a boat oughta 
 I'm too poetically inclined, one of a kind 
 True and divine the genuine, breakin a bond and gettin' mine 
 So freeze, I'm makin' it flow with ease 
 And droppin' the funkiest lyrics that ever been known to MC's 
 'Cause I can recite it fast, or even rap slow 
 Huh, man I can just talk and my shit'll flow 
 Because I mastered the rhythms of winnin' lyric 
 Hit em, just the flow itself'll tell you that I did em 
 So let the K-to-the-A-to-the-N-to-the-E 
 Show you the meaning of real harmony, as I float
