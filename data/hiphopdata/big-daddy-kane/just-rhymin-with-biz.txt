Biz: 
 <Fonkee! 
 Ready? 
 Fonkee! 
 Fonkee! Ah... 
 One two, one two 
 We came here to just motherfucking do 
 You and a crew 
 Got my man Marley Marl in the house 
 Can抰 forget my man, Lik, y抋ll in the house 
 Got Fric and Frac in the house 
 Hey-hey-hey, you got Big Daddy Kane in the house 
 Juice Crew in the house 
 That抯 right 
 And my name is the Biz Markie 
 And we gonna rock a little something like this...> 
 One, two, whatcha gonna do? 
 I say yes, yes y抋ll 
 To the beat, all 
 Party-having people guaranteed to be like having a ball 
 H-h-h-hey 
 We gonna do a little something like this I say... 
 I抦 the rap promoter 
 I start to motor 
 Tour from New York to South Dakota 
 Drink ginger ale or root beer soda 
 Never get the girls with the underarm order 
 Put me on water, I抦 a good floater 
 When I run for prez, you best be a voter 
 Once knew a girl by the name of Rhoda 
 I watch Star Wars just to see Yoda 
 Or R2-D2 driving down the BQ 
 When I buy franks, I make sure they抮e Hebrew 
 When I entertain, and love to treat you 
 Love to see a girl in a nice tight see-through 
 Take her to the crib, turn on the Beta 
 Watch a good flick by Arnold Schwartzenegger 
 Maybe Commando or the Terminator 
 Peace party people, ha ha see you later! 
 Big Daddy, huh huh, my man my mellow 
 Get on the mic cause you know you eat Jell-O 
 Kane: 
 Check it out, y抋ll 
 You don抰 stop 
 Keep on 
 Well it抯 the Kane in the flesh 
 Of course I抦 fresh 
 Oh you thought that I was rotten? 
 Huh, I beg your pardon 
 To me getting paid and getting busy fall together 
 So a man of my ambiance... never! 
 Could I be weak, why I抦 rather unique 
 I got style, flavor, grace, and plus a different technique 
 That I be using and not many can manage 
 So a brother like me, I do damage 
 Just by picking up the mic to go solo 
 I cold turn a party on out, and oh yo 
 I get physical, mystical, very artistical 
 Giving party people something funky to listen to 
 That抯 why the other MC抯 can抰 swing long 
 I stomp them out just like I was King Kong 
 Stepping on roaches, I get ferocious 
 Supercalifragalisticexpealidocious 
 I go on and on and on and 
 Until the bright Shirley Murdock morning 
 'Cause I抦ma pimp, hear the primp, yes the emp- 
 Eror, bringing much terror in your era 
 I ready, willing and I抦 able, so bust a move 
 Never use a barbershop I got my homeboy Smooth 
 Cooling out with the clippers right around the way 
 To keep my fresh Cameo cut every day 
 Like that y抋ll, it抯 like that y抋ll 
 It抯 like thata-the-that, it抯 like that y抋ll 
 'Cause I抦 the prosecutor taking a stand 
 And, I抦 cross-examining you my man 
 The judge and jury, releasing my fury 
 The verdict that I reach for you is rather blurry 
 You see, the name Kane is superior to many people 
 It means King Asiatic Nobody抯 Equal 
 I hate to brag, but damn I抦 good 
 And if mics were a gun, I抎 be Clint Eastwood 
 And if rap was a game, I抎 be MVP 
 Most Valuable Poet on the M-I-C 
 Or if rap was a school, I抎 be the principal 
 Aw fuck it, the Kane is invincible 
 To be specific, I may die one day 
 But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic 
 It抯 a certain special skill that takes much practice 
 I got it good, apparently you lack this 
 So in turn, sit back and learn 
 Listen close, this is for your own concern 
 Let me show you exactly how it抯 properly done 
 Lights, camera, action! 
 A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also 
 Cameo afro, Virgo, domino, I go Rambo 
 Gigolo, Romeo, Friday night spend money on a ho- 
 Tel, to get a good night抯 sleep 
 I抦 keeping in step 
 Now do I come off? 
 Yep.
