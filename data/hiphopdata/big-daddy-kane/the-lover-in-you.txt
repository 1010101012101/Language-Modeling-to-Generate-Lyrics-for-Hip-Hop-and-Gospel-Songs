Take it from the man that does it real smooth 
 All that, "Yo baby yo baby," it's... it's-it's-it's not the move 
 You gotta treat 'em with respect, never neglect 
 Try to protect, most of all, project some intellect 
 Present yourself all proper is important if you truly do want her 
 So be a gentlemen, and be in her corner 
 Make her feel like the most 
 For example -- forget Goodfellas, and take her to see Ghost 
 Wine and dine under candlelight 
 Make the mood right tonight while the stars are bright 
 Then hop in the hot tub and start to rub her on her back 
 Tssssh, yeah they like that 
 Satisfaction guaranteed 
 We gotta give the woman what she need 
 These days, they don't be fallin' for no phony Casanova 
 Since they started watchin Oprah 
 So even if it's not your style 
 Open the door for them once in a while 
 Even buyin them some flowers don't hurt 
 Yeah it sounds old fashioned... but it works! 
 Conversation, good communication 
 Only makes things better in a relation 
 'Cause if you keep watchin the game every week 
 You might find out your wife's gettin' dunked by Dominique 
 And that can be so upsettin 
 So try a little Tenderness like Otis Redding 
 Put the gangster approach on pause 
 And I dedicate this to you and yours
