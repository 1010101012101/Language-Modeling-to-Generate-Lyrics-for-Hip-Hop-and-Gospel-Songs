Daddy daddy tell me a story of how you took out that wack MC 
 No daddy, tell them how you beat down that bootlegger 
 Daddy daddy tell us a story! 
 Heh heh, all right, all right, all right y'all OK 
 Come on y'all, crowd around daddy now OK? c'mon 
 Y'all just sit there and listen 
 I'ma tell you about the MC 
 And I'ma tell you about the bootlegger, OK? 
 Here we go children 
 It happened at a jam, some kid tried to sham on the program 
 So I had to silence the lamb and show him who I am 
 So I just set it off on my competitor 
 Freakin' the funk as I hit 'em with crazy metaphors 
 Like back up off me dukes, because you're trippin' 
 You better dry your cranium off, cause your brain is slippin' 
 You beatin' me is somethin' that I doubt 
 The only way you could bake kane is workin' in a crackhouse 
 No man alive can withstand the kane flow 
 I kick so much flavor that my shoes loOK like a rainbow 
 You need a whole lot of practice, you thought that you was 
 On the money so I took you out like taxes! 
 Now you can flea off, releasin' me g, easy be 
 To keep the great MC 
 Then I throw 'em I lean and mean record to spark 
 So I can school that ass just like Joe Clark 
 Next I translated, my rap is more educated 
 And made it complicated for him to illustrate it 
 My dexterity, put him in fear of me 
 And had his mind bewildered by everything he was hearin' see 
 That was enough to slow his whole train of thought down 
 So I just speeded the pace up more than enough for him to come around 
 I triple the words, when makin' the rhymes, whatever the rhythm 
 Puttin' his mind in a prison 
 And oh yeah, that's how I did em 
 That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah) 
 That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah) 
 That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah) 
 That's how I did 'em (hey) 
 I was out flex, lookin' cold sex in a lex' 
 Sippin' on a beck's, pumpin' the remix of Das Efx 
 Drive down 125th with my man 
 And what did I see, bein' sold at the stand? 
 A bunch of bootleg tapes that he had claim on it 
 So I snatched everything with my name on it 
 And give me that kool g. rap tape, and give me that ice cube 
 And all the wu-tang joints, 'cause they're my boys too 
 A man tryin' to make a livin', I can't knock it 
 But now you tried to take money out of my pocket 
 Word to miz, what the problem is, is that the kids 
 Didn't buy it from the wiz, they bought your shaky fibs so 
 Now it's time to move him off the block 
 Pass me the glock 'cause I might make a body rock 
 And I'll break down sixteen shots 
 That's one + eight + seven on a undercover 
 Bootlegger, you're worse than a beggar 
 Makin' a fake profit, stop it 
 'Cause I work hard for the money, to make cash flow 
 To have another come along and take my dough 
 No 
 So I just told my man, aiyyo 
 Throw the tapes in the Lexus 
 Then we burned his whole stand down just like Waco, Texas 
 And then I jumped on the brother, with rage 
 Crushed his ribcage, damn did he get slayed 
 'Cause I don't think he even know whatever hit him 
 Bootleggers beware, cause yeah I did em 
 That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah) 
 That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah) 
 That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah) 
 That's how I did 'em (hey) 
 Give it your best shot, bring it with all you got 
 And watch the bombs I drop just rock your knot 
 Cause it ain't wise to address me 
 I wouldn't advise a schoolteacher to test me 
 'Cause I don't just do em, I run through em 
 And I don't just hurt, uh uh, I body work em 
 Lyrical torture, never could support ya 
 For steppin' to me, agony is what it brought ya 
 Cause you never seen this type of lyrical genius 
 That could never be touched, and I mean this 
 So one love, I'ma leave you with the rhythm 
 Ain't no need to go off, cause yo hon know I did em 
 That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah) 
 That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah) 
 That's how I did 'em (huh) that's how I did 'em (hah) 
 That's how I did 'em (hey)
