Somebody get the God Kane, I know he'll back you up 
 Kick a rhyme spectacular, I think the Nigga think he Blackula 
 I seen somebody trying to get him with sunlight 
 Somehow it wasn't done right, then he just laced him with one bite 
 Go for the jugular vein, that's my new thing 
 How did you do it with two fangs, think they were gold like Wu-tang 
 Your luck has been changed, you're left strucken with pain 
 Well good for your ass kid, that's what you get for fucking with Kane. 
 I creep on MC's like po' nine and take rhymes the whole nine 
 To dig in you rappers like a coalmine 
 Now look what I dug me, somebody better turn me off or try to unplug me 
 Ooh it's starting to get ugly 
 Don't miss this, hold on with a clenched fist 
 As I tongue the microphone down just like a French kiss. 
 Relentless with lyrics that be brutal, hip-hop I stay true to 
 Put it on you like voodoo 
 Unda presha, niggas unfold and felt the heat 
 Possessed with the Brooklyn techniques we freak 
 Ay yo Kane, hit us off with that shit one time 
 They can't believe it, infatuated hardcore rhymes 
 When you diggin' out your girl from behind, you're gonna find 
 The reason that her eyes are closed, Black Caesar's on her mind 
 Your royal smoothness, honeys out there know how it goes 
 Even Cabesa de pollos that habla Espaé§‰l 
 Dig this now, run for your life to get away but none do 
 Even if you escape just tell me who can you run to 
 Test the, stupendous, tell me what was you to gain 
 Internal bleeding, due to Kane 
 Boom bow bow, ooh, the pain 
 Nobody's equal, keep it lethal, and diesel, to see to the people 
 And reach your cerebral cause that's how we do 
 The pain gets inflicted, fake MC's get evicted 
 Face it, truth of the matter is just that I'm too hard to get with 
 Since days of Pro Keds, I shined over mad heads, roll up on you like the Feds 
 Rip your whole set to shreds 
 A crash or a wreck, because I mash for respect 
 Only thing I want to know now, is this cash or a check? 
 Ain't no question, 
 I'm suffering a bad case of lyrical congestion 
 Not the one for testing, 
 Come mess with and end up with your chest split 
 No, not because of cardiac, but because how hard he act. 
 I'm recognized as the microphone destroyer 
 Competition minds in the state of paranoia 
 I said if you're scared, get a dog 
 So by tomorrow you'll probably see 20 rappers walking with Rotweilers 
 Your gimmick is primitive, and impotent 
 You won't win with it so limit it 
 Before I make your body start to hemorrhage 
 Just when you thought that you was burning me 
 You found yourself bleeding internally 
 Now you heads is l
