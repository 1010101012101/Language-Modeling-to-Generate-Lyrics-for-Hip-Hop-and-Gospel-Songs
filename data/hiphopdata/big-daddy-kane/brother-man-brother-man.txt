 (Kane) 
 Check it, we wreck shop, from nighttime to dawn 
 It's goin' it's goin' it's goin' it's goin' 
 (Shane) 
 It's gone! 
 Cause lil' daddy's like a rap helter skelter 
 A bad mother... 
 (Kane) 
 Chill shane, respect your elders 
 My younger one, uh, tall and yellow 
 Aiyyo, I got you covered like an umbrella 
 (Shane) 
 Well, I got a little rap thing I wanna breeze through 
 (Kane) 
 So may I release you? 
 (Shane) 
 Oh oh, please do 
 (Kane) 
 So lil' daddy, my ace, my brother 
 Get on the mic and let's rock with one another 
 (Shane) 
 And, here comes the six foot four, the rough and raw 
 To blow up the mic with rhymes you like 
 I strike the stage in a rage and burn just like a twelve gauge 
 Shotgun, cause son, the shane is not the one 
 The noise bringer, humdinger, funky rhyme stinger 
 Bring your girl to my show and I'ma swing her 
 The lil' daddy got it down pat, yeah 
 I'm like the name heavy d, I sound fat 
 Word for word, line for line, uh 
 I gets mine and show I'm poetically in-clined 
 If rap was made by ? then redeemed because 
 You ain't got no ahhhhhice creeeeeeeeam 
 So take a seat in the rear 
 Don't dare to compare, 'cause I swear, you gets nothin' here 
 The way you see me knock out the next brother 
 You'd think my moms had a talk with ll's mother, huh 
 Aiy-yi-yi-yah, momma mia 
 Man I burn the next MC like gonorrhea 
 Knock the boots on a girl named althea 
 Then pull her friend by the name of maria 
 (Kane) 
 Well I got a little rap thing I wanna breeze through 
 (Shane) 
 So may I release you? 
 (Kane) 
 Oh oh, please do 
 (Shane) 
 So big daddy, my ace, my brother 
 Get on the mic, and let's rap with one another 
 (Kane) 
 When I grab the microphone and shout 
 You gotta spread out, spread out, spread out, spread out 
 I'm ready to rip it apart, I hit 'em with one of the rhymes 
 I'm rough in a flash, trash, bash, crash, smash slash mash 
 Run for shelter, no one can help ya 
 You pushed up on a heavyweight, when your rhymes are welter- 
 -Weight that's right, wait, because you're not fitted 
 *Singing* you're never gonna get it, never gonna get it 
 Uh, I'm what you call a rap legend 
 And definitely the last MC to be present 
 Don't even try to take mines 
 You fuckin' new jack, you still got price tags on your rhymes 
 Yo what's that sayin' that hammer says uh 
 U can't touch this, just like a pimple yo I'ma bust this 
 I'm like steven segall, _out for justice_ 
 As for competition, pssssssh, what's this? 
 You're not prepared too, rappers are scared too 
 Confront this, cause you know damn well you don't want this 
 Some good advice is just break out 
 Before I treat you like a fast food restaurant and take-out 
 As soon as I see the microphone yo I'ma, seize that 
 Squeeze that, a battle, you better, freeze that 
 'Cause if you go through the wrath of kane, uh 
 Not even lisa fisher can ease the pain, so 
 [K] brother man, brother... man 
 [S] uh-huh, brother man, brother... man 
 [K] yo, brother man, brother mega-man, uh!
