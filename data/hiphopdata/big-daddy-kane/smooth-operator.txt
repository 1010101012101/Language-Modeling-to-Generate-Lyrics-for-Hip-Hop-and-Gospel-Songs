Well excuse me, take a few minutes, to mellow out 
 Big Daddy Kane is on the mic and I'ma tell about 
 A minimum length, of rhymes of strength 
 And power, so listen to the man of the hour 
 Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know 
 Sing hoe, swing low, then yo the show 
 Will go on, as I perform 
 Transformin on stage like a Decepticon 
 But I'm not animated like a cartoon 
 I'm for real, shootin lyrics like a harpoon 
 Across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators 
 So let's groove with the smooth operator
