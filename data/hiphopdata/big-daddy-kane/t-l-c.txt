(Kane) 
 Question... what has he done, for you lately? 
 Tell me... do y'all go for walks on the beach? 
 I just wanna know, if you had dinner at the pond 
 Or the drive-through at Mickey D's 
 You say the last movie y'all saw was _Jaws_? Mmm 
 Well never fear baby, the Big Daddy is here 
 I come up upon the scene to romance thee 
 With a little bit of T.L.C. to tickle your fancy 
 Give you protection, warmth and affection 
 Make sure you never feel any rejection 
 Without a doubt, I admire you, I have a desire to 
 Be a more better man prior to 
 Your past relationships, you've been datin 
 With all the wrong gentlemen, I'm more sentimental 
 In my own little way so (HEY!) 
 Whattaya say about givin' a play okay? 
 'Cause I'm not here to impress you, I wanna caress you 
 Posess you and bless you, nevertheless 
 To make you feel secure, and real sure 
 Mon cheri amore, pretty woman I adore 
 Don't shed a tear never fear my dear I'll be there 
 Anywhere with some Tender Lovin' Care 
 Chorus: repeat 2X
