(Big Daddy Kane) 
 Mmmhmm... right, right 
 What we have here... is a collaboration 
 Of the Big Daddy Kane... and the Little Daddy Shane 
 We're gonna send this out to... all the brothers, 
 And sisters, around the universe 
 It's a tune... a tune about unity... 
 And peace amongst each other 
 And we're gonna have some fun, peep this 
 The B-to-the-I-to-the-G-to-the-D 
 To-the-A-to-the-D-to-the-D-to-the-Y 
 To-the-K-to-the-A-to-the-N-to-the-E 
 The Smooth Operator's in the place to be 
 (Little Daddy Shane) 
 The L-to-the-I-to-the-L-to-the-D 
 To-the-A-to-the-D-to-the-D-to-the-Y 
 To-the-S-to-the-H-to-the-A-N-E 
 The Little Daddy Shane for the world to see 
 Ricky-ticky-tempo, no surrembo 
 Italian men, call their girls a bimbo 
 Puerto Rican men call their girls muchacha 
 Ask me how I know, 'cause I'm a girl watcher! 
 (Big Daddy Kane) 
 Now I must admit that I'm a sensitive guy 
 'Cause I cried on Cooley High when Cochise died 
 But then again at times I may be a mean fellow 
 'Cause I didn't give a damn about the dog Old Yeller 
 But I love my brother (and I love him back) 
 I wish people of the world could be like that 
 So shake shake y'all (shake y'all) shake y'all (shake y'all) 
 And bust the move we make y'all
