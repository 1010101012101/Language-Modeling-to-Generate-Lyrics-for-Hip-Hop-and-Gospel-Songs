Yo 
 Uh Huh 
 Yo 
 I must have played that tape over a thousand times 
 (Verse One) 
 I be like melody 
 Rob First Fiedelity 
 Cock back, top cat 
 Can't make contact 
 With me 'cause I'm lost 
 Brush niggaz off 
 I'm like toothpaste 
 Rap flourides you couldn't move with a suitcase 
 Lock it up, cock and bust, seventeen 
 I'm raw like the coke my boys be sellin' fiends 
 Need to make cream, be financial, make papers 
 If niggaz front take it by force like a rapist 
 Niggaz look it 
 I'm hot like the peppers that Puerto Ricans cook with 
 Trick up the sleeve 
 Y'all thieves that never took shit 
 Real bad actors 
 Try to operate and get sued for malpractice 
 Don't make me gang trip 
 Talk all nice 
 I walk on ice, can't slip 
 Pace got the vision of a chosen few 
 Hopin' you only speak when you spoken to 
 <'Pacewon' scratched in> 
 I can't lose even if the fight fixed 
 Take my time laid back 
 If you rush you might miss 
 My voice transmit through your sattilite dish 
 And it go a little something like this... 
 <'Pacewon', again> 
 (Verse Two) 
 Around the way, like L.L. 
 Guns hot as hot tameles 
 Crooked and unhonest 
 Swing wood like Jimmy Conners 
 I'm Pace Won the drug thief 
 Rugged like rugby 
 High off the cannabis 
 Props to my company 
 Presidential canidantes 
 Gone sour, not sober 
 Sellin' cold cut with baking soda 
 Static but I cling not 
 Weed addict 
 I'm a nigga with a sling shot 
 King props 
 Read my rap sheet 
 Pace to Won is nasty 
 Drive by 
 Two guns out the window 
 Bustin' from the back seat 
 Hit the deck and get ghost 
 Coast to coast, world wide 
 Pace comin' with toast 
 High hopes 
 Pace comin' dope 
 And it go a little something like this...
