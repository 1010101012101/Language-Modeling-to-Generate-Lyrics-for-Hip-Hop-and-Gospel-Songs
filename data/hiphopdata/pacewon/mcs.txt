Emceeee's 
 Master of Ceremonie [yeah!] 
 Emceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 
 Emceee's 
 Master of Ceremonie, cause to me Emcee means Move the Crowd 
 (Verse one) 
 Yeah 
 A supreme MC has lots of girls 
 Lets his nine go bang while he rocks the world 
 Yo, a cool MC stolls through the bitches 
 Might be on the run down "THE ROAD TO THE RICHES" 
 A wise MC blazes through 
 And he ain't NO JOKE 'cause he's "PAID IN FULL" 
 Yo, a raw MC loves to blast weapons 
 You know the nigga motto, "AIN'T NO HALF STEPPIN'" 
 A slick MC is wet off props 
 He'll tell the CHILDREN a STORY while he let off shots 
 Ah... a critical MC takes a stand 
 If you fear a BLACK PLANET planet c'mon raise your hands 
 People... a hard MC got to sell 
 His MOTHER said KNOCK YOU OUT while he ROCKS THE BELLS 
 Brotha... a real MC talks so brave 
 And they also taught me how to "WALK THIS WAY" 
 What! 
 (Verse two) 
 Yeah 
 A natural MC never kicks a bad rhyme 
 The WORLD IS HIS, he be chillin' at "HALFTIME" 
 A rugged MC comes with a better plan 
 Always ready like yeah "WHATEVA MAN" 
 Methodical MC's get the check 
 And they got hot nickels so "PROTECT YA NECK" 
 Uh... a consistent MC will use a BLUEPRINT 
 To BIG PIMP while he schools his students 
 A B.I.G. MC rolls with a M.A.F.I.A 
 Versace shades, watchin' ya, like "WHO SHOT AT YA?" 
 An entertainin' MC is nice to me 
 So put your fuckin' hands WHERE MY EYES CAN SEE 
 Thanks... a thug MC is just like a viking 
 Make a song about you and you'll still like him 
 Deep MC's is total OFF THE BOOK niggaz 
 MURDA MUSIK, they scare all the SHOOK niggaz 
 (Verse three) 
 A SHADY MC pulls up in a mp 
 Whips out a gat but the mothafuckah empty 
 A crazy MC, he always wanna SHYNE 
 Till he locked up in a cell doin' nine, nigga why? 
 A loose MC, he always wanna shoot 
 He ain't gotta do much, that's THE REASON he "THE TRUTH" 
 A southern MC will capture you 
 Screamin' out "MOVE BITCH" as he "ACT A FOOL" 
 A creative MC is always official 
 Even have his own language "FA SHIZZLE MY NIZZLE" 
 Hey, a clever MC locks the stress out 
 He don't give a fuck like "KNOCK YASELF OUT" 
 A strong MC is crafty y'all 
 He will catch himself "SLIPPIN'" like "GET AT ME DOG" 
 Argh!...true MC's paint our hood 
 With SOUL even if it ain't "ALL GOOD" 
 Yo!
