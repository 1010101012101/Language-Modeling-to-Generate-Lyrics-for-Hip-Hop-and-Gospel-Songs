Yeah 
 This right here 
 For all them niggas that like to talk 
 Talk the talk 
 You better walk the walk 
 Knowmsayin? 
 Cause one of these days 
 When I see you in the dark 
 I wage war on stage or street 
 I battle defeat 
 Relentless 
 You get shot like tetanus 
 Feel the wetness 
 Gush 
 I'm in a rush 
 No time to sigh 
 Now die 
 Shit is so fly that I gotta get clearance 
 In case I enter air space interference 
 Mach 1 
 When I rock, son 
 'Cause I take off 
 While you make fake soft 
 Little jingles 
 Sell a few singles 
 But that ain't shit 
 Cause a hit ain't a hit without the lyricalist 
 And at 22 
 I'm takin' any crew 
 At any time 
 Cause many rhyme 
 But a lemon ain't a lime 
 And I don't falsify to get by 
 You must be more than herbally high 
 To verbally comply 
 To my vocal range 
 I get strange when I change 
 Into the syllable killer 
 So beware 
 'Cause I'll be there 
 Lurkin, workin 
 Till your head hurtin'
