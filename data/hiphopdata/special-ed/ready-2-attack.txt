Well, it's 1990, '89 has ended 
 Now it's time for all those who pretended 
 To settle and cease with the noise 
 You and your boys - it's time to put away the toys 
 Christmas is over and this is my resolution 
 To stop the confusion 
 Let the fresh get fresh and the stale get staler 
 And throw 'em in a pale of 
 Trash with the other trash and smash down the lid 
 For all the weak shit they did 
 Never in my life have I seen such preposterous behavior 
 And you got no flavor 
 Can't taste the juice 'cause I got the matz 
 I heard you paid for your _Billboard_ spots 
 Honest, I promise, I am not a liar 
 Can't you understand that I am flier than a flyer 
 No need to try a stunt like that 
 Never in my life could I front like that 
 On _Soul Train_ with your brand new hit 
 When it wasn't even playin' cause you ain't sayin' - 
 Nothin', 'cause they're wacker than wack 
 Yo Ak - get ready to attack 
 (Crushin MC's that be tryin' to riff)
