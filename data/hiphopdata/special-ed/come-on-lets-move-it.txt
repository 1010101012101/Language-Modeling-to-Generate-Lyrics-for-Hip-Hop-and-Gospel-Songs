I was proven effective by a clinical test 
 Because some couldn't come to believe I was the best 
 So they tested me, and now they in the clinic 
 They almost arrested me, because I did it 
 But I didn't mean to do it 
 But you had to mess with me, and then you blew it 
 Now you got to chew it, and swallow it all 
 I guess that's the way that you bounce the ball 
 Or somethin' like that, my mother always told me 
 Your mother always told me, "Baby, hold me" 
 Don't get mad because you don't get g's 
 And I get extra cheese like pizza 
 You can't keep your girl because you can't please her 
 But let's get back to the fact that's been approven 
 So let me prove it, come on, let's move it 
 (Come on) 
 (Yeah y'all, come on)
