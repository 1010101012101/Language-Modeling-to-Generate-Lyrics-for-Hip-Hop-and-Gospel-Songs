'I want you all to go to your windows 
 Go to your windows and yell out 
 Scream with all the might that you can muster up inside your bruised, assaulted and battered bodies 
 That you are sick and tired of being a nigga' 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell the government 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell htem white folk 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell them black folk 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell the world 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Waitin' with my hands out 
 Broke in the hood, they give a damn 'bout 
 Braggin' to my homie 'bout the hoes I fucked 
 Drinkin' bottles after bottles, plus I smoke too much 
 I never had a job that would pay me well 
 I took what I could 'cause they gave me hell 
 Spend what I stole on some clothes and kicks 
 My ex girl say I won't amount to shit 
 But she suck and fuck, when my car roll up 
 Tried to fuck her sister, but she talk too much 
 Her mama shake her head whenever I come 'round 
 Whatever high I had when I saw her might come down 
 I barely go to church but I say I will 
 I bow my head right before I eat my meal 
 The world's fucked up and they claimin' I'm to blame 
 It's a damn shame cause 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell the government 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell htem white folk 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell them black folk 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell the world 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Waitin' on a play to come through 
 Chillin' with my homeboys Plottin' on you 
 Watchin movies how to come up quick 
 Recruiting young niggas I can come up wit 
 Barely read books but they down to shoot 
 Live life breakin rules, they got something to prove 
 Parents ain't around they got nothing to lose 
 Wave the tool on a fool for some brand new shoes 
 Little child runnin' wild in the streets 
 Wanna be a G so he look up to me 
 Try to hit the block and make a name 
 Claim he caught a body now he got it and he feeling all the same 
 Till the family of the victim come knockin' 
 Millin through the corners of the ghetto till they shot him 
 Youth still dyin' and they claimin' I'm to blame 
 It's a dame shame cause 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell the government 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell htem white folk 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell them black folk 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell the world 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Always tryna sell you something 
 Don't really know the shit, but tryna tell you something 
 Tap dance if you want him to 
 Coulda fed the hungry but he bought them jewels 
 Won't ever look back 'cause he gotta keep movin' 
 Even if he leave his own people bamboozled 
 Takin' credit like he did it by himself 
 Too much pride to realize that he really had help 
 Always judge a man by his wealth 
 He ain't me so he can't feel how I felt 
 He saw me walkin' and he ain't look back, too scared 
 We make eye contact 
 So he can he didn't see me when he drove by 
 And I could say he didn't see me and it's all right 
 He just want the fame from the game, it's a shame 
 I bet he think I'm just another nigga 
 Tell the government 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell them white folk 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell them black folk 
 I don't wanna be another nigga 
 Tell the world 
 I don't wanna be another nigga
