Old school when I ride, forever sky high 
 Workin' wood wheel, when the sun outside 
 I'm just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires 
 Not a care in the world, me and my girl 
 Candy coated pearl with the bowling ball swirl 
 I'm just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires 
 Now this could be one of those days 
 I chop on my blades, leave my worries behind 
 Just pretend that I'm paid 
 Do it big, do it large, on the boulevard 
 Get a cig of some cess, pushin' candy cars 
 I did some thangs for that Chevy mayne 
 Restored the frame, blew the brains, out on everything 
 I ain't ashamed, scooped my dame 'cause she down to roll 
 Since way before, don't touch my screens or my radio (say what?) 
 She know the score 
 Old school when I ride, forever sky high 
 Workin' wood wheel with the sun outside 
 I'm just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires 
 Not a care in the world, me and my girl 
 Candy coated pearl with the bowling ball swirl 
 I'm just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires 
 Now this could be one of those days 
 Parlay and I ball, turning necks till they break, outside of the mall 
 Going in going hard like a superstar 
 Break the bank full tank take me super far 
 I swang and bang, sittin' heavy mayne 
 Hoggin' lanes candy paint never leave a stain 
 Let it rain hydroplane but I'm ridin' slow 
 Eyes closed, Etta James keep me on my toes (Say what?) 
 Can't let her go 
 Old school when I ride, forever sky high 
 Workin' wood wheel, when the sun outside 
 I'm just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires 
 Not a care in the world, me and my girl 
 Candy coated pearl with the bowling ball swirl 
 I'm just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires 
 Wheels on the slab go round and round, round and round, round and round 
 The wheels on the slab go round and round, round and round, round and round 
 Screens in the slab fall down and down, down and down, down and down 
 The screens in the slab fall down and down, down and down, down and down 
 Old school when I ride, forever sky high 
 Workin' wood wheel, when the sun outside 
 I'm just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires 
 Not a care in the world, me and my girl 
 Candy coated pearl with the bowling ball swirl 
 I'm just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires
