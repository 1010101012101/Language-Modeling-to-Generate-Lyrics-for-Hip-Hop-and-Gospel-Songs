Now I was doing it big all on my own 
 Gripping wood grain and riding on chrome 
 Sprinkling game everywhere that I go 
 Cause all these horny girls wanna fuck 
 Now I was old school riding slamming my doors 
 Recline, shine like a pimp 'suppose to 
 Life ain't nothing but a EQ of highs and lows 
 EQ's highs and lows 
 I got more than your amount, what's in your account 
 Young Krizza newest out the south 
 So it's going down, 
 I think you a hater if you can't see that a player 
 With this diva, major leaguer and these fuchsia alligators 
 Shawty got me fucked up, I'm never slipping never tricking 
 For no treats that ain't for free up on these streets if it ain't Halloween 
 And while these boppers on my dick I swear they trying to fuck my whip bobbing 
 Cause my paint was candy sour, apple green 
 I pull the baddest broads up out they drawers and barely wave 
 If you ain't winning in this game then you've barely played 
 If you ain't buying what you want then you barely paid 
 If you didn't see me hiding then you could barely hate cause 
 I was doing it big all on my own 
 Gripping good grain and riding on chrome 
 Sprinkling game everywhere that I go 
 Cause all these horny girls wanna fuck 
 Now I was old school riding slamming my doors reclining, shinning like a pimp suppose to 
 Life ain't nothing but an EQ of highs and lows 
 EQ's highs and lows 
 I got everything you want, everything you need 
 Damn right, I'm the coldest nigga out, you liable to freeze 
 Never ever bring your girl around she liable to leave 
 She ain't never been around a pimp, she was dying to see 
 I'm out these [?] that fliest of the freshest that was freshin up the fly 
 I'm major in the pimping I'm just rapping on the side 
 For the benz with the trim and the teriyaki tires and 
 The plane that don't take off if I don't ride 
 Oh so live like pay per view I show you what paper do 
 Make her popping and drop it slide back and forth like a fader do 
 I'm feezle incredible 
 Swear My vessel hater proof 
 Only me myself and I is who I cater, cause 
 I was doing here big all on my on 
 Gripping good grain and riding on chrome 
 Sprinkling game everywhere that I go 
 Cause all these horny girls wanna fuck 
 Now I was old school riding slamming my doors 
 Reclining shinning like a pimp suppose to 
 Life ain't nothing but a EQ of highs and lows 
 EQ's highs and lows 
 I'd rather be with you, yeah yeah 
 Said I'd rather be with you 
 I'd rather be with you, yeah 
 Said I'd rather be with you 
 I was doing here big all on my on 
 Gripping good grain and riding on chrome 
 Sprinkling game everywhere that I go 
 Now I was old school riding slamming my doors 
 Reclining shinning like a pimp suppose to 
 Life ain't nothing but a EQ of highs and lows 
 An EQ of highs and lows.
