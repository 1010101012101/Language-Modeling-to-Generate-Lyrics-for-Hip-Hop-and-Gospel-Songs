See, they wonder why we ride high 
 Why we get high 
 Shit, it's just to get by 
 See, some days, sometimes, the world lets you down 
 And you can't do nothing but fall 
 This is for y'all 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 See, we be going through some things 
 Police hit the block and make it hard for us to hang 
 My girl bitch 'cause all I ever do is swing and bang 
 Pourin' up I swear my liver never be the same 
 A pint of Hen'll get me in, help to ease the pain 
 World fucked up and I can't seem to leave the game 
 So I continue bending corners, bitches switching lanes 
 Ain't trippin' on the sun, sometimes I'd rather feel the rain 
 Get high to maintain, don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 I made some things that I regret, but that's just how it be 
 I lost some friends, fucked up some money, but stayed on my feet 
 I did all I could in my city so I have to bounce 
 I signed my deal and got more haters than I care to count 
 But I can't fault them for their feelings 'cause I know the score 
 It's hard to celebrate for others when you're dying poor 
 So I keep rolling low-key, DOLO, trying not to stunt 
 I crank my system till it's clipping then I let it thump 
 Put all my problems in my cup while I grip the wheel 
 There's too much money to be had, I ain't sitting still 
 A country boy trying to make these petty ends meet 
 I learned my lesson, can't trust these niggas 'cause they envy 
 Can't stop no show, I'm about this dough, and that's all I can say 
 Thank god for everything, I coulda died like yesterday 
 Make room for me in case my plane just ain't meant to fly 
 I hope you feel if I fall from the sky, hollering out don't let me die 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down 
 Don't let me down
