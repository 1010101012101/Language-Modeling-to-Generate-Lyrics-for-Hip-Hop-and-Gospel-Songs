I wish I was a kid again 
 Running with my friends and them, up and down the street 
 Waiting on the bell to ring, riding on the school bus, drawing on the seats 
 On the phone all night with the girl I like that she claims she's freak 
 It's straight I would neva go back, I could neva go back, but it would be cool to see 
 Rise and Shine get up off my ass and mash for cash 
 No time to procrastinate 
 Yeah, I'd rather drink a 40 but that have to wait 
 I write a bucket it's kinda of rusty but I blast the base 
 On the road again for the pros we in 
 The block used to be sunny but they snowed it in 
 Now the junk is great taste for the dollar menu 
 That's what he said, but the rock is what he really into 
 Gave him a dollar anyway, cause who knows 
 Maybe the dope boy baby needs some new clothes 
 Could we all go and through it, no matter how you view it 
 Slice it, cut it, bring it back or screw it 
 Hot as ever been but I'm cooling it ah 
 They see never works on my window, down 
 Not worry, kids will reset the days, reminiscence good lord 
 While I used to run in places sometimes 
 Sometimes I wish I was a kid again 
 Running with my friends and them, up and down the street 
 Waiting on the bell to ring, riding on the school bus, drawing on the seats 
 On the phone all night with the girl I like that she claims she's freak 
 It's straight I would neva go back, I could neva go back, but it would be cool to see 
 Grandma Annie on the go, cooking in the kitchen something good for my soul 
 G.I. Joes on a her living room flow 
 It seems like yesterday, but she passed so long a go, good heavens 
 I wanna go to church but ain't no good reverends 
 She probably frownin' down on me 'cause I know better 
 But I push on, searching for some cush on 
 To pay the busing responsibilities that I disown 
 Not a pot to piss in a tree to piss on, the devil come around too much 
 I'm hollering get going 
 But it's hard to get off when you can't get on 
 I brought my life on this wax nobody listens songs 
 So I cruise, me and just my blues 
 Looking at the world through my broken rear view 
 Not worry, 'cause I pray for better days, reminiscence good lord how I used to run in places sometimes 
 Sometimes I wish I was a kid again 
 Running with friends and them, up and down the street 
 Waiting on the bell to ring, riding on the school bus, drawing on the seats 
 On the phone all night with a girl I like and she claims she's freak 
 It's straight I could neva go back, I would neva go back, but it would be cool to see 
 Mrs. Linnie outside in her garden 
 My brother his son and his daughter 
 The rap game befo I was spittin' 
 Back when Pac and Biggie was livin' 
 Ooh ooh it would be cool to go back 
 But now where we at with no regrets I'm waiting on what's next 
 I wish I was a kid again 
 Running with my friends and them, up and down the street 
 Waiting on the bell to ring, riding on the school bus, drawing on the seats 
 On the phone all night with the girl I like and she claims she's freak 
 It's straight I would neva go back, I could neva go back, but it would be cool to see
