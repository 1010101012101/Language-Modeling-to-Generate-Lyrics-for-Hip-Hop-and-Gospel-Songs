(Handwriting's on the wall) 
 Yeah, it's on the wall 
 I'mma keep drinking till they toss me out this motherfucker man 
 Excuse my tone of voice but today was just a bad day 
 Label hit me about another single and said I ain't had play 
 Since Country Shit, hell they thought that was a regional record anyway 
 But thank God for Bun B and Ludacris because they had faith 
 That shit would take off and it did, guess I was too country to quit 
 I make albums not hits, these rich folks don't know about this 
 But that's cool, I'm back to that K.R.I.T. Wuz Here 
 Pray to God this was meant for me, a king to be 
 Hoping my time was near 
 Maybe I'm rapping in vain, maybe this wasn't my lane 
 Maybe I'm hurting myself, talking 'bout real life instead of the fame 
 How can I change? Shawty I swear I think I'm wasting time 
 On the phone with my pops like, "I just wanna save some lives" 
 I just wanna do some right with the wrongs I was dealt 
 My pride might be my downfall, but I ain't asking for help 
 I wear my heart on my sleeve, don't run into me cause it bleeds 
 No disrespect to your craft, but I make my own beats 
 Shit the handwriting 
 (The handwriting's on the wall) 
 Man the Hennessy do something to a nigga man sometimes that shit... 
 I just can't hold back, you feel me? 
 First quarter got me like boiling water with soda in it 
 Drop my project in the pot watch it lock up like those in prison 
 Gotta prove these people wrong that don't see the vision 
 Three nominations, number one on 106, hell I forgot to mention 
 Two free albums minus label support 
 Fired my publicist 'cause I forgot what I was paying him for 
 Drunk till I'm barely conscious, call Jonny tell him put Sha on 3-way immediately 
 'Cause I'm sick of being lied to and I'm waging war 
 Then I'm going back to Sippi-land and I'm quitting rap 
 Ain't that bad 'cause when I was poor, hell I was fairly happy 
 Dealing with the critics and the comments got me trippin' 
 Like my accent and my tone make it really hard to listen 
 I was scarred but I was driven before the politics came 
 Lynching rappers and dropping albums, and watching 'em hang 
 I pushed mine back with fear that they might just do me the same 
 'Cause I rebel I might get shelved, but that's part of the game 
 Hell, the handwriting 
 (The handwriting's on the wall) 
 Goddamn right it's on the wall 
 I take this shit seriously man 
 This is my life, this all I've ever known 
 This all I'll ever do and I promise to God I won't let nobody take it from me 
 I did it for all of mine and all of yours 
 Ten toes deep in the game I'm in 
 I'm bound to lose if I'm living in sin 
 If I play to win will I make it out? 
 I'm tired of feeling my heart Lord I just wanna scrape it out 
 This the road less traveled, shit I just gotta stay the route 
 I hear the hate and all the betrayal I just gotta phase it out 
 With another shot, better chase it down with a glass of Crown 
 Put that on my tab, yeah I'm doing bad 
 'Cause music's all I've ever known, shit, all I've ever had 
 Tryna say something, tryna do something, tryna be better 
 Ain't much time left, I gotta make do, I can't live forever 
 Ain't that what makes me me? No smoke and no mirrors 
 And I don't even wear Loc's, so they can see me clear 
 And you can say that I'm bitter but tell me if I'm trippin' 
 They stick their noses up and talk down on Mississippi 
 Imagine how you'd feel to know you work hard, and you educated 
 And they treat you like you never made it 
 The handwriting 
 (The handwriting's on the wall, final curtain's about to fall 
 Just ain't no feelings left at all, the handwriting, handwriting's on the wall)
