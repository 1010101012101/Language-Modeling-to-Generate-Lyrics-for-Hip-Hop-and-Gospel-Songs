Speak up for them 
 Your friends, your relatives, your neighbors 
 It's a good idea to speak up for them 
 And it's always good to thank God 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 Yeah, I know it sound cliché 
 And they tell me just to pray, but 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 Yeah, I know it sound cliché 
 And they tell me just to pray, but 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 Early morning, whipping up breakfast 
 So unexpected, I'm barely yawning 
 Iron my school clothes, food up on the stove 
 Biscuits was hella fluffy, "Grandma, I need two of those" 
 You whisper wait for my brother, Papa do what you say 
 'Fore a crumb could hit my tongue, tell me to pray 
 Scrape my plate, wash the dish 
 Be prepared for the world and be thankful of the time that I get 
 To be young on the run 
 Don't be eager to be grown, have some fun 
 You'll look back when you turn 21 
 Like "My, time flies" 
 Wishing you were you here by my side 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 Yeah, I know it sound cliché 
 And they tell me just to pray, but 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 Yeah, I know it sound cliché 
 And they tell me just to pray, but 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 Like an autumn breeze, knocking all the pecans out the trees 
 Baking your fruitcakes for Christmas Eve 
 The smell of sweet potato pie make it hard to leave 
 Sit and reminisce, out the grab bag, everybody got a gift 
 Just be thankful for the the thought, don't be giving lip 
 We laugh and cry 
 You knew you couldn't save the world, but you had to try 
 I been doing the same 
 Just so you know, your lectures ain't going in vain 
 Accepted that you're gone but I deal with the pain 
 Weather the rain, just know I won't be the same 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 Yeah, I know it sound cliché 
 And they tell me just to pray, but 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 I miss you like yesterday 
 Yeah, I know it sound cliché 
 And they tell me just to pray, but 
 I miss you like yesterday
