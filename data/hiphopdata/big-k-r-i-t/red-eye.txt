I'm like what happened to us, maybe I'm rapping too much 
 I been missing your touch, sometimes I'm out and I lust 
 What if love ain't enough, and all we have is this trust 
 What if I'm fucking that up, so you don't trust in me much 
 I'm wasting your time, to say I'm straight, I'd be lying 
 It's either you or this music but I can't make up my mind 
 I'd throw you a line, I'd give you a sign 
 Right now I'm through with the trying, I think you ready to fly 
 I settle for less so when I'm tired of stress 
 I go through with the motions pretending I'm at my best 
 Fall victim to flesh, I live to be fresh 
 But this ain't what I expect because my life is a wreck 
 I run out of breath 'cause I ain't taking the steps 
 Money comes and it goes till family's all I got left 
 I'm seeing my growth, but I'm still from myself 
 You'll be hollering out next because you're ready to fly 
 I can't find the words so you'll just fill in the blanks 
 I'm doing the norm and not what it takes 
 I'll keep folding my cards and you'll keep raising the stakes 
 Till we forget about us and what we have is too late 
 I know in your heart, you ain't conditioned to race 
 So I steady the wheel, forever pumping the breaks 
 Resort to the bottle, that's how I deal with the shakes 
 Pray for these haters, that's how I deal with the hate 
 Look to the sky, don't be content with the now 
 You ain't concerned with the why, you just wanna know how 
 I didn't give her the chance, when you just wanna be down 
 And save me from myself, but I'm wanting to drown 
 King is much more than the weight of a crown 
 As good as it feels, that ain't the way that it sounds 
 Being single is cool till ain't nobody around 
 Then I'm chasing you down, 'cause you was ready to fly 
 I can't be what you want me to be 
 You're shooting too high 'cause you ain't aiming at me 
 One minute you're calling out for the D 
 Then the next minute you wanna be free 
 Then the next minute you hollering out peace 
 Although I know it's a war and they'll be blood in the street 
 If you call don't be frustrated at me 
 Just leave you're heart at the beep, 'cause mine is harder to reach 
 'Cause mine is harder to see 
 And that don't make it harder to cheat 
 Being friends would make it harder to breathe 
 So if you're ready to fly, just forget about me 
 But if you're willing to try then I'm willing to leap 
 Out of the window of pain and fall in love at your feet 
 I ain't the man you want me to be 
 I guess that's what's been bothering me
