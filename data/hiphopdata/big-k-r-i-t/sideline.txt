I can't play the sidelines with all my folk in the stands 
 Giving up just ain't a part of the plan 
 I can't play the sidelines while they still chill 
 Yeah, I been down but I'm still here 
 I can't play the sidelines, yeah, I can deal with the pain 
 'Cause you ain't winning 'less they hollering ya name 
 I can't play the sidelines so put me in coach 
 I swear to God, that's all I got to live for 
 On my first rep, trying to max out 
 Lifting burdens, being worried 'til I pass out 
 Jumping hurdles, running laps just for scraps in this rat race 
 Lord knows I'm tired, never step, gotta keep pace 
 Read my playbook, lay my head down 
 Caught a sprain, ice buckets by my bed now 
 Felt an impact like a truck hit me full contact 
 No pads, Lord come get me, I'm down 
 I can feel it in my soul 
 This my last chance to shine but they know I'm getting old 
 Hard to move on, my legs ain't been the same 
 Since I took a fall from greatness 
 Now I knowing when it rains on my homecoming 
 See my folks, smiling, coach by the dope 
 I'm the goat but I really need to hold something, one more dime 
 I'll be fine, yeah, I'm the best in my prime but what about now 
 I can't play the sidelines with all my folk in the stands 
 Giving up just ain't apart of the plan 
 I can't play the sidelines while they still chill 
 Yeah, I been down but I'm still here 
 I can't play the sidelines, yeah, I can deal with the pain 
 'Cause you ain't winning 'less they hollering ya name 
 I can't play the sidelines so put me in coach 
 I swear to God, that's all I got to live for 
 On the second set, got to do this for myself 
 When the balls in my court, can't depend on no one else 
 This a long shot but I trained all my life 
 Broke some bone, cried some tears just so I could get it right 
 When it's time, hit the gym trying to win 
 On the off-season, doing what I can but I'm running out of time 
 Got a partner going through it 'cause his bill's still due 
 And he ain't started since the moment that he signed 
 Physical training and all 
 Rehabilitation the 'cause of shooking, jiving, no hard turf 
 Ain't no complaining at all when they overturning your call 
 This is life and yes, it's hard work 
 We out here fighting like dogs in every man backyard 
 Trying to get what was lost reimbursed 
 Just to be a ghost on the wall 
 Give it my all 'til they hang up my shirt 
 I can't play the sidelines with all my folk in the stands 
 Giving up just ain't apart of the plan 
 I can't play the sidelines while they still chill 
 Yeah, I been down but I'm still here 
 I can't play the sidelines, yeah, I can deal with the pain 
 'Cause you ain't winning 'less they hollerin' ya name 
 I can't play the sidelines so put me in coach 
 I swear to God, that's all I got to live for
