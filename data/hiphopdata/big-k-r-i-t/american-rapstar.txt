(Intro - Talking) 
 An A&R once told me "you can determine the worth of a song within 15 seconds of it playing" 
 With complete 'n' utter lack of the fact that it takes takes all 3 minutes and 40seconds of a song 
 To comprehend what I'm sayin' 
 It ain't a single if it don't fly 
 It ain't a hit if it don't ride 
 Now he couldn't tell me the components of a smash but the ringtones were their all-time high 
 And a rappers only as big as his chain, the flashier the better 
 They say money make the World go round 
 You never lost till you lose your crown 
 And they don't love you till you're on the ground 
 Or when you're maxing out your bank account 
 Yeah, you do it all just to live the life 
 Even if it means you don't live it right 
 And even if it means you don't survive the night 
 But if even if you do you won't survive the hype 
 Of an American rapstar 
 (Big K.R.I.T - Verse 1) 
 Push it to the limit just to get up high 
 With a wood grain kitted? 
 Ride around town like I never lived in it 
 Gun in my dash, pray I never kill with it 
 I'm that real with it 
 Got my eyes on the prize 
 Bills still due, muthaf-ck 9-5 
 Searching for a freak that wanna f-ck once or twice 
 Wanna buy a bottle but I ain't paid my ties 
 This ain't no lie, I got a vision and a masterplan 
 To hit the block and blow up like a Taliban 
 I make run the plane never have to land 
 I make it where them lames never stand a chance 
 Shit, you'll never know what the time'll tell 
 And see the star or find the scale? 
 We be buying or you tryna sell 
 You either fall or you grind the rails 
 (Big K.R.I.T - Verse 2) 
 So watch me get it how I live 
 Waiting on my momma, screaming f-ck how they feel 
 Dodging jail cells and them pigs down in? 
 They shot Oscar Grant swear it gave a n-gga chills 
 Lets keep it real, if you ain't looking keep your eyes closed 
 Will I pay what I owe, only God knows 
 I ain't for show, give me strength just to change what I can't 
 And understand the difference between a n-gga and the King that I am 
 Gotta keep ya finger on the trigger 
 Pac died, Biggie died, they ain't found a killer 
 Momma say she worried 'cause I rap about the Government 
 And how the Church caked other people out there struggling (its real though) 
 I just call it how it is foe 
 I'm breathing for a reason, what you here for? 
 They got us with the villains who a chill for? 
 'Cause they murdered all the heroes
