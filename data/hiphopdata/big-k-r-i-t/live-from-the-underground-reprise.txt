I'm going live from the underground 
 From the underground 
 I'm going live from the underground 
 From the underground 
 And I'm gone, just be strong 
 You're not alone 
 (You're not alone) 
 I'm going home 
 (I'm going home) 
 Carry on 
 (Carry on) 
 Carry on 
 (Carry on) 
 Carry on 
 (Carry on) 
 Carry on 
 (Carry on) 
 I'm going live from the underground 
 From the underground 
 I'm going live from the underground 
 From the underground 
 Yeah, I know it's hard 
 This world will let you down one day 
 (Down one day) 
 Just let down your guard 
 I'll pick you up if you're 'round my way 
 (If you're 'round my way) 
 Call my name, free your chains 
 Call my name, free your chains 
 I got to get a move on 
 I got to get a move on 
 I got to get a move on 
 I got to get a move on 
 They say the train still coming, it won't be long 
 Only the good Lord knows my wrongs 
 Trouble is the damn devil won't leave me alone 
 No time to waste, I gotta pay my dues 
 Lord, my problems seem to come in twos 
 All these miles I walk, they can't fill my shoes 
 I'm going live from the underground 
 From the underground 
 I'm going live from the underground 
 From the underground 
 Now, this is my grandson, Justin Scott
