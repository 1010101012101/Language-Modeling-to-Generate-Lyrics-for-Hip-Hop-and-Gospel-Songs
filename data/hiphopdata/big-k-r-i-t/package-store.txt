Just the other day when I was out at the store 
 Saw a preacher hella creepin', trying to bang on a ho 
 That same motherfucker used to bang on my door 
 Hollering 'bout donations for cause cause collections is low 
 Damn shame, but I got change, so I give to the plate 
 He know I know he buying pussy, he don't lie to my face 
 Said that I should cut my grass 'cause I'm surrounded by snakes 
 Not sure if that was metaphoric or if he had seen one today 
 I know what he said but maybe I beg to differ 
 The only souls you like to touch were the legs of strippers 
 The only reason I know that 'cause I used to tip 'em 
 How could I judge when in this world we both some niggas 
 And we both some killers, and we both some thieves 
 Only God can save us all what he spoke to me 
 What he hoped to be was a better man in due time 
 But he fell short tryna sip on the wine 
 In the neighborhood package store 
 Get some wine for spirits 
 Some gossip for your mind if you down to hear it 
 In the neighborhood package store 
 Silver and gold for the low 
 And some papers for your woes you can roll 
 In the neighborhood package store 
 Mixing the good with the bad 
 Which flavors of life's labor have you had? 
 In the neighborhood package store 
 Don't need directions for the gun shop, it's on the same block 
 Of the neighborhood package store 
 Click clack 'gainst my head went the Glock 
 From a hoodlum on the block 
 Whispered to me "What you got? 
 You'll get shot if you refuse to come up off that 
 What made you floss that outside the package store? 
 You know we out here like wolves searching for antelope 
 Lambs, and sheep, prey on weak 
 Don't you reach under your seat, I'll bust your head like cantaloupe" 
 Then I replied "Out for a nightcap 
 Didn't bring my tool with me 'cause I assumed that I'd be right back 
 Shawty said the neighborhood was cool and it wasn't like that 
 But here you are with a loaded gun and I'll be damned if I'm gon' fight back" 
 So he went on to loosen up on the aggression 
 And proceed to lecture me on the troubles of recession 
 And ain't that many jobs outchea hiring convicted felons 
 So instead of buying what he want, he taking what they selling 
 Then bailing into the darkness, forever on the grind 
 Addicted to the feeling of wine 
 In the neighborhood package store

 Of the neighborhood package store 
 Gripping Golden Grain, flying like Thunderbirds 
 Easy, Jesus, watch your Crown while I swang and swerve 
 Molotov bottle, alcohol, not a Tylenol 
 Could remove the kind of headache that a fault could (?) cause in the streets 
 Don Julio my peeps 
 Cuervo, chasing hoes, Captain Morgan with my feet 
 Standing tall on 'em, till I rendezvous with Grey Goose 
 Cool gray, salty taste, almost threw up on my shoes 
 Hypnotiq blues, Bloody Mary red 
 Codeine purple seem to take me to the edge 
 One more shot all I need just to hit the ledge 
 Toss and turn, crash and burn, just to crawl up in my bed 
 Going to my head, seeing circles lately 
 Tasting cream daily, I don't mean Bailey 
 Vodka tried to kill me, but Seagram Gin saved me 
 Been a customer so why they play me
