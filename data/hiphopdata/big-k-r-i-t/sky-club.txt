Now I'm popped up twice, drink on ice 
 High beams on, forever top flight 
 Mile high flow, cabin pressure low 
 Watching out for traffic control 
 I'm clear for landing, landing, landing 
 I'm clear for landing, landing, landing 
 I'm clear for landing, landing, landing 
 Shit, I'm too fly to be touched 
 Too hard to be crushed 
 Jammin' when I pull out on the scene 
 Hoes hop up out they jeans 
 Jaws drop up on the scene 
 When that plane be super clean 
 Like something out of a dream or a movie 
 Groovy broads dress up at they choosin' 
 I feel 'em all the same 
 Down to do whatever before I ask 'em they name 
 They just wanna know Krizzle can you sing 
 I say yes I can 
 Even with the highs and lows 
 Pull up in that old ride 
 Do it like a playa 'posed 
 Back to what I was talkin' 'bout 
 Don't miss out on this pimpin' cause ain't no stalling out 
 I get ya where you wanna 
 That's if ya calling out to me from the stands 
 I'll holla at ya when we land 
 Now I'm popped up twice, drink on ice 
 High beams on, forever top flight 
 Mile high flow, cabin pressure low 
 Watching out for traffic control 
 I'm clear for landing, landing, landing 
 I'm clear for landing, landing, landing 
 I'm clear for landing, landing, landing 
 Shit, I'm too fly to be touched 
 Too hard to be crushed 
 This that skew it on the Bar-B, where's the party 
 Summertime and feeling fine and drinking forties 
 With my kinfolk playing spades and still debating 
 Bout going to the club after, shit's overrated 
 I'm kinda faded, my shawty jaded 
 'Cause I don't pick up when she call, it's complicated 
 Holla later, roller skating, super bassing 
 Turn it up to the max like goodness gracious 
 It's back breaking, my neighbors hate me 
 Keep it shaking, 808 earthquaking, life changing 
 The way it knock on the pavement hear me in Asia 
 The way it thump in the trunk, you'll think I'm in danger 
 Becoming one with the sun like a space invader 
 Another shot just before it I don't need a chaser 
 Reggie Miller ain't allowed, we don't like the Pacers 
 When you in my plane hangar 
 Now I'm popped up twice, drink on ice 
 High beams on, forever top flight 
 Mile high flow, cabin pressure low 
 Watching out for traffic control 
 I'm clear for landing, landing, landing 
 I'm clear for landing, landing, landing 
 I'm clear for landing, landing, landing 
 Shit, I'm too fly to be touched 
 Too hard to be crushed 
 If you drinking and you po' somethin' 
 One time, one time for y'all 
 If ya smoking and you roll somethin' 
 One time, one time for y'all 
 To all my family let me hold somethin' 
 One time, one time for y'all 
 And all them broads that's down to show somethin' 
 One time, one time for y'all 
 Now I'm popped up twice, drink on ice 
 High beams on, forever top flight 
 Mile high flow, cabin pressure low 
 Watching out for traffic control 
 I'm clear for landing, landing, landing 
 I'm clear for landing, landing, landing 
 I'm clear for landing, landing, landing 
 Shit, I'm too fly to be touched 
 Too hard to be crushed
