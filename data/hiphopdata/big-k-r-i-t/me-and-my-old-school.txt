Ride, ride, ride clean 
 If you, if you ride old, ride slow 
 Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors 
 If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow 
 Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors 
 I remember way back in the day 
 All I wanted was a candy car with hella flakes 
 Crushing hoes, slamming doors while the chassis shake 
 From the sub, work the juice, bitch I want the bass 
 Can't be turning on a dime cause the rims scrape 
 Kill switches for them jackers outchea tryna take 
 That's my prized possession in recession kept me straight 
 Clear my mind then recline on the runway, from Monday to Sunday 
 Just me and my old school (repeat) 
 Ride, ride, ride clean 
 If you, if you ride old, ride slow 
 Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors 
 If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow 
 Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors 
 Ain't nothing changed, still the same country bumpkin 
 M-I crooked Super Southern don't be trippin' on my rims 
 I'd rather sit higher than bald eagles on shoulders of giant people 
 If I'm gon' ride, hell, I don't know about them 
 Popping my collar, rocking gators, fuck some Prada 
 Be a scholar of this pimpin' to the very very end 
 Forever official like words out the scripture 
 Off the Richter, saw the future through my rear-view lens 
 Just me and my old school (repeat) 
 Ride, ride, ride clean 
 If you, if you ride old, ride slow 
 Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors 
 If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow 
 Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors 
 See it ain't just a car, it ain't just a whip 
 It's a time machine, it's a spaceship, it's precious 
 You gotta take your time, you can't be rubbing on them curbs 
 And hitting them potholes 
 You gotta ride clean and ride slow 
 Me and my old school 
 Ride, ride, ride clean 
 If you, if you ride old, ride slow 
 Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors 
 If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow 
 Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors
