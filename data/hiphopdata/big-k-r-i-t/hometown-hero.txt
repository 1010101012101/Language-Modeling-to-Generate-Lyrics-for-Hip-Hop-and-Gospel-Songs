A superhero in the flesh 
 Even at my worst, I'm the best 
 For the finish, I stretch 
 When they advance me this check 
 Coulda bought my way to heaven but I blow it on my neck instead 
 What you expect when you ain't have shit 
 And they ain't paying half of what you asking 
 Couldn't even see the pussy even if it's Cassie 
 Lot of hoes are down for taking pictures 'cause you're flashy 
 You can't even imagine, maybe Kim Kardashian 
 Number one song and a Grammy, now I'm smashing 
 Maserati crashing, swerving through the traffic 
 Wrap it 'round a pole, sell a mil off the tragedy 
 I defy gravity 
 Flyer than I half to be 
 Talking to the Lord 
 "I can't stay, who gon' save hip hop after me?" 
 It's like a torn ACL to an athlete 
 Boobie Miles, Friday Lights, capture me 
 In my hometown 
 King of King City 
 Third Coast Representer, Mississippi Switchin Lanes 
 King City, King, King City 
 Third Coast Represtenter, Mississippi Swithcin Lanes 
 300 My my, 300 my stomping ground 
 300 My my, 300 my stomping ground 
 300 My my, 300 my stomping ground 
 King City, M-Town, Hometown Hero 
 It's just Ciroc in the cooler 
 Not a day off, but I'm still Ferris Bueller 
 Winners never lose, so how dare you confuse us 
 They quote what I spit like Confucius 
 He say, she say, rumors all day 
 The rap game is high school, and life's a hallway 
 Like what clique you in 
 The Beamer or the Benz 
 The Bentley or the Lambo 
 Like here we go again 
 Don't sit at my table 
 VIP, I got this 
 If you ain't popping champagne after every game then don't pop shit 
 Homecoming queen with my picture in her locket 
 But I know what's up with her hands in my pockets 
 They love me cause my swag is so jock-ish 
 Freshman year, saw her ring like I'm boxing 
 You voted most likely to never ever top this 
 I'm Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman 
 In my hometown
