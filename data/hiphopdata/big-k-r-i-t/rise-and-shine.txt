Rise and shine 
 Uh you gotta get up get out get somethin'... 
 Uh 
 Early mornin, kinda sleepy, still yawnin 
 Log-onin, dial tonin 
 Forever phonin, for a blessin 
 Will you help me, get my ass up out the bed and go 
 God love me 'cause he said it so 
 Don't look away 'cause I beg for mo' 
 Then I ever ever had 
 Praying for the future but I'm dealing with the past 
 Momma say I'm worry 'cause I too much like my dad 
 Somethangs are forever, nothin' ever last 
 Like the cries under the sun know when big mama pass 
 Time travel fast, search and you should find 
 No break from yo slumber, open up yo blinds 
 Rise and shine 
 "The latest I can be was on time" 
 You gotta get up get out and get something 
 Why rest when all the world runnin' 
 Rise and shine 
 "If life is a dream, why sleep at all" 
 Nothing ever comes to those that just wait 
 Don't never lose sight of your goal just keep straight 
 The early bird gets the worm, you live and you learn 
 (I been waiting on my chance) well you gotta wait your turn 
 To whom it may concern, ain't much time left 
 Gotta fight to the death of my family 
 MJ baseline they can't handle me 
 Slam dunk hang time like a canopy 
 Tired sitting on the couch 
 (Watching celebs pout about the troubles of a million dollar house) 
 So tell 'em I'm out on my grizzly 
 Put'cha lighters in the air if you feel me 
 I ain't lyin', it's the time 
 To wake up, wipe ya eyes 
 Rise and shine 
 Uh, yo, yo 
 Free yo mind 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo 
 Rise and shine 
 "The latest I can be was on time" 
 You gotta get up get out and get something 
 Why rest when all the world running 
 Rise and shine 
 "If life is a dream why sleep at all" 
 Nothing ever comes to those that just wait 
 Don't never lose sight of ur goals just keep straight 
 Rise and shine
