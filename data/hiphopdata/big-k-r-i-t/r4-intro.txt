spoken: 
 Hey, hey now, hey man it's always good to see you. 
 It's good to see you my brother, good to see all a y'all. 
 I called this meeting today to, umm, discuss a matter at hand. 
 It's a movement we got goin' on. Know alot of y'all may have heard of it, 
 Called the R4, the return of 4Eva. 
 And, uh, you know, it's it's it's not easy to talk about, 
 If you can dig it, but if you just check, you might catch my drift. 
 It's when the lights get dim and the people get quiet 
 Whilin', waiting on change. 
 They been standing in line for hours at a time 
 Just to see you you hit the stage. 
 You got a feeling that you never really felt before, 
 Deep down in your gut. 
 That's when the DJ hit the replay on the track 
 Just to make 'em turn it up. 
 Now the crowd starts chantin', everybody frantic 
 You know that you runnin' behind. 
 The promoter sold way too many tickets for the venue, 
 He might just shut it down. 
 So they rush backstage like you gotta go on, 
 And you gotta go on right now, 
 And you pass your drink to the broad with the dank 
 Like baby girl hold it down 
 Then they hand you a mike that's all you need. 
 Peek out the curtain and all you see 
 A wave of people, screamin eager, 
 To tell them a story that'll set them free 
 Let them be a new generation of rebels, 
 And that there my friend is how you begin 
 The returnof4eva. 
 (Alarm) 
 (Banging) 
 Hey yo KRIT! 
 Hey 'cause! 
 Hey cut that fucking alarm off, dog! 
 It's too fuckin' early in the morning for that shit! 
 Yo, get up! 
 God damn!
