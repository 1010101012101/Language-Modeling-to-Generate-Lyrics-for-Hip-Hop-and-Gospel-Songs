So I ride I Lean I crawl 
 Do it better than them all 
 Let the road be my guide 
 As I glide in candy cars 
 Underneath the moon and the stars 
 (Big K.R.I.T.) 
 My digital dash 
 As I mash on the gas 
 Don't know where I'm going fast 
 But I'm going there 
 Stop at the club 
 Forever show some hoes in there 
 Shaking their ass 
 Looking for players with doe to share 
 But that ain't me tho 
 Before I trick on a bust it baby 
 I'm outta the door 
 If you are looking for savings shawty 
 Not your hero 
 More like a guide 
 I can take you where you want 
 Would you look in my eye 
 Like you're supposed to 
 Cold enough to froze ya 
 Talking about that pimping 
 You already have been exposured 
 Far from being sober 
 Let's travel into space 
 While puffin on this Yoda 
 Glowing like a light saber 
 Doing what the grownups do 
 Be grateful that this game was bestowed upon onto you 
 Cause back there man betraitors don't try to listen to 
 'Cause they front 
 But they don't do 
 What I do 
 'Cause they will never ever be this 
 So I ride I Lean I crawl 
 Do it better than them all 
 Let the road be my guide 
 As I glide in candy cars 
 Underneath the moon and the stars
