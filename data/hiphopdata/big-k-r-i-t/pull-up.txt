 Five in the mornin', ridin' 
 Yawn and take her my beat up 
 On the way to Obaco with a crib 
 That I can kick my feet up 
 See the panties was shinin' 
 Freshly primin' first time I seen 'er 
 Now she wanna ride high 
 With her head in the sky 
 Look down on all her people 
 Ain't it crazy panty be crackin' 
 When I'm slappin' them bones 
 I was told to jump in 
 And camp fire the Amazon my dogs 
 So what's twerkin' and broken in here? 
 I shouldn't thought of Po 
 From them strippers that love 
 The suckin' fuckin', get get down on the flo' 
 Transformers can't fuck with this 
 That the way my dough flip 
 Skyscraper tall when I creepy crawl 
 They crip on solar clipse 
 Rise to the apes in my trunk 
 And my terriers swang dine 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 Then uncuff your chick 
 (Cuff your chick) 
 She here legit, bitch

 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over

 Said bitch I pulled up on your turk 
 Straight pilled off with yo girl 
 Said she wanna ride with it 
 Just wanna get that dick 'cause she deserve it 
 And my backseat softer than a pillow top 
 Pants so wet that it hit the spot 
 And I'mma quench your thirst 
 Man, that nigga should've did it first 
 You was holdin' hands and I was in a perse 
 I'm gettin' dough dup on the city lights 
 She right side, she can lift steel 
 Tryna make show that her titties right 
 We in the parkin' lot 
 With the trunk open and sippin' 
 Sittin' outside the whip 
 With the world grand wheel 
 Like it's nineteen ninety six 
 Yeah chick, I'm ridin' dirty 
 Kicks up bitch, I know you heard me 
 Tryna get the leg with the eighty four's 
 Tank just don't say beg for mercy 
 I just want the swangin' bangin' 
 The work of the whole wide, leave you hangin' 
 Gotta let 'em know I'm forever 
 Whole and kickin' doors open 
 Pay what you owe me, I told 'em 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 Then uncuff your chick 
 (Cuff your chick) 
 She here legit, bitch

 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over

 See pimpin' is what pimpin' is 
 And Mac can do what he feel like 
 Trip the tray where that duck is stichin' 
 And fold the boll so I peel right 
 Candy paintin' on that Friday man 
 Turn the grill on that woman 
 That face so hard that it's numbin' 
 That chrome so shinny it's blindin' 
 Them seats so soft that I'm sinkin' in 
 And so it's no need to recline 'em 
 I drop the top and you see me 
 Got different shit on this TV 
 That one with Sopranos, the one with the wire 
 The one that finally score up that aisle 
 I represent for that D-A-T 
 And ace the whole, I feel tippin' 
 I chunk the dudes when I'm flippin' 
 For my city I pull on 
 R-I-P to the pimp, it's U-G-K 
 For life and I'm gone 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 Then uncuff your chick 
 (Cuff your chick) 
 She here legit, bitch 
 (It's legit) 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 When I pull up, it's over, I pull up, it's over 
 Then uncuff your chick, she here legit, bitch
