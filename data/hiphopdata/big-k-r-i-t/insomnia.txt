It's late but I'm out on the creep 
 It's been a while since I heard you speak 
 Hard to rest when I've been on this road 
 All I want is you next to me because you help me sleep 
 I swear it 'bout 4 in the morning 
 And I'm outchea on it 
 Trying to fall through just to fuck with you 
 Well that's if you home, 'Cause you help me sleep 
 Getting harder and harder to relax, can't (?) my back 
 Gotta be on my P's and my Q's when I roll with this tool in the old school 'Lac 
 'Cause niggas try to jack nowadays in the hood 
 Those broke niggas up to no good 
 Get the cup full of drank and I'm filling my tank 
 Plus I woke up some of that, good 
 Sticky-icky, sour, Jolly Rancher candy 
 Make the bottom of my cup sweet as your punany 
 Well I'm just joking shawty 
 I talk about pussy a lot and getting money when I get unfocused shawty 
 'Cause I'm dealing with the pain of the game 
 And it's getting harder to keep coping shawty 
 'Cause I can't set the world and I showed that, so I hold back 
 For doing what I can to be a better man forgetting you know that 
 So we fuss and fight when I'm gone, wasn't right when my wrongs 
 Almost there won't be long, don't fall asleep on the phone 
 Tell me what you got on, send a pic to my phone 
 I been out all day tryna make a way for you, hell yeah I'm in the zone 
 Just eat you out, tell me what that peach about 
 Feeling good feeling great when I pull off your lace 
 And ease it in and ease it out 
 And ease it in again I got to get home, yeah I been drinking 
 Don't be acting like it don't feel the same, I hear it in your tone 
 Yeah I was working earlier but baby girl I'm on the way 
 So keep playing with yourself 'cause I'm making that left 
 I'm at the gate, buzz me in, meet me at the door 
 Body soaking wet, panties on the floor 
 Yeah I got that, rocked that, beat it till it's sore and I knocked it chopped it up 
 When you suck better sop that up, don't ? when it's deep better prop that up
