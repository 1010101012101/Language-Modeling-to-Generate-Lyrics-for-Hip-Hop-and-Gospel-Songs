I told her you should go home it's better that way I wish I could come with you but I got to stay? but I got to stay? but I got to stay 
 All aboard I heard 'em call your name I knew you got your ticket now you're on your way and it was hard to watch you wave goodbye I write you here and there with no need to reply it's just I lost a good friend in a time of need like forever would be better but this time your free hate you left us kind of selfish just to think that way you going home don't worry what you probably would say but yeah it hurts I smile at the thought you at peace in your mind no longer ache in your heart finishing star rising sun finally hear you father and sir and we're done I strive to be half of what you was I'm just hoping that I can carry on your love and I regret all the times I had to leave you I promise Ima see you when I see you 
 I told her you should go home its better that way I wish I could come with you but I got to stay? but I got to stay? but I got to stay 
 Your motherly hands used to usher Sunday mornings played the tambourine so well reminiscing on my granddaddy shed tears as you look at his pictures on the shelf phone ringing everyday friends gone away wishing you could go but you had to stay I sit and cried with you soon the villains of the past aware one day that you pack your bags turn to me and ask don't fret when I leave this earthly body of mine done did all of its deeds crawled till it walked and held all it could breathe carry on what I taught you was given through HE to you from me in times like this believe I got a call like you used to get just the other day they told me you'd gone home to stay 
 I told her you should go home its better that way I wish I could come with you but I got to stay? but I got to stay? but I got to stay 
 Now I know what you meant when you used to say if I had wings, wings, wings I'd fly away I'd fly away 
 Lord, if I had wings, wings, wings I'd fly away I'd fly away 
 I told her you should go home it's better that way I wish I could come with you but I got to stay? but I got to stay? but I got to stay
