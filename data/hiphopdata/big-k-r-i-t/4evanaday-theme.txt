They said it couldn't be forever 
 Wouldn't be forever 
 The grain ain't enough 
 You gotta mix it with the leather 
 Your grind ain't enough 
 You gotta mix it with the hate 
 When it's all over watch what I say 
 4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day 
 4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day 
 4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day 
 4eva n a day, watch what I say 
 4eva n a day 
 My momma say what's up bitch, how ya feel 
 I dedicate this to them haters that's in my grill 
 Them doubters and them non believers that said I wouldn't 
 And them A&Rs when I spit them bars that said I couldn't 
 And them bourgie broads that wasn't fucking when I was broke 
 Now they squeeze by to the V-I so I can jump down they throat 
 I put it on the line and do what I love and above all have hope 
 If it was meant for me and it was meant to be then it'll pay off like it's sposed 
 They said it couldn't be forever 
 Wouldn't be forever 
 The grain ain't enough 
 You gotta mix it with the leather 
 Your grind ain't enough 
 You gotta mix it with the hate 
 When it's all over watch what I say 
 4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day 
 4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day 
 4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day 
 4eva n a day, watch what I say 
 4eva n a day 
 They tryna say that I switched up, but most of them niggas done bitched up 
 If you ain't 'bout your own people, what you gon' raise your fists for? 
 Old school with them kickers, like karate feet, my money stretch like Pilates be 
 If you never been to the top it's something that you gotta see 
 Somewhere that you gotta be, I never dealt with the lames 
 Knock on wood but I'm hella good in this candy paint 
 No time to waste, keep my pace, forever still 
 Worry about you and how you live, I did it big, I hurt they feelings 
 They said it couldn't be forever 
 Wouldn't be forever 
 The grain ain't enough 
 You gotta mix it with the leather 
 Your grind ain't enough 
 You gotta mix it with the hate 
 When it's all over watch what I say 
 4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day 
 4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day 
 4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day 
 4eva n a day, watch what I say 
 4eva n a day 
 I dedicate this third verse to all the candy coaters and the slab riders 
 Record breakers that did mad favors when they knew no one ever heard about us 
 And them playa pimps, Chevy donks that crank the thump till the trunk beat 
 Cross love from a bad broad that jump in 'cause she fuck with me 
 In the hood selling CDs 'cause they showed love at the Mom and Pops 
 Till I sold 'em all even when my buzz was small and still chose to cop 
 Fact remains that I'm still the same and I'll never change or settle 
 'Cause I ain't tripping on mainstream cause love from the underground, that's forever 
 They said it couldn't be forever 
 Wouldn't be forever 
 The grain ain't enough 
 You gotta mix it with the leather 
 Your grind ain't enough 
 You gotta mix it with the hate 
 When it's all over watch what I say 
 4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day 
 4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day 
 4eva n a day, day, day, day, day, day 
 4eva n a day, watch what I say 
 4eva n a day
