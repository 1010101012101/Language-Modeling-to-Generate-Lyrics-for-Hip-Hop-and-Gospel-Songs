A, will you uh uh uh uh catch me if I fall? 
 Will you uh uh uh uh catch me if I fall? 
 Will you uh uh uh uh catch me if I fall? 
 Yeah, I gave my all 
 Yeah, aye I'm a man so I stand on my own two 
 I give a damn about a hater and his whole crew 
 No jump shot so I'm selling crack 
 To tell you the truth, I've been through Hell and back 
 No food in the kitchen so I'm scrapin' scraps 
 Tightest nigga in the world can't afford to rap 
 Now I'm on the hunt for a nigga to jack 
 Soon as I get rich it's where I'm givin' it back 
 It's cold out here, you gotta hold your own 
 I never knew what pain was until I was grown 
 I never miss my home boy until he was gone 
 But life goes on, so if I call 
 If I fall by the river bed 
 Would you save me or leave me dead? 
 All the blood I shed 
 And I'll just rest my head 
 Ain't nothin' easy 'bout the life I chose 
 Wasn't much of a choice, just the life I know 
 Smokin' weed, drinkin' liquor just to kill time 
 When I'm fucked up, the only time I feel fine 
 Mama say I'm lettin' life go by 
 As if I ain't grindin', as if I don't try 
 But you can see in the eyes, you worry 'bout it baby 
 Late night, scared a nigga might play me 
 Police in the street, don't phase me 
 Get it how you live little J Smith 
 Be as me a dude, yeah I can't starve 
 But that ain't all so if I call 
 If I fall by the river bed 
 Would you save me or leave me dead? 
 All the blood I shed 
 And I'll just rest my head 
 Yeah, I used to love 'er, I used to hold 'er 
 She made me promise I'd never let 'er go 
 She made me smile, could I have a child? 
 I held her tight like I never held before 
 But things change when you get older 
 She started drinkin' 'cause I ain't sober 
 That's when I told her 
 "Be careful 'bout the friends you keep 
 Cause the ones you call friends ain't friends to me" 
 Now we don't see eye to eye 
 The more I tell her the truth, the more she lies 
 The more we shoot each other down, the more we die 
 I think it's best that I said goodbye 
 So when I call 
 If I fall by the river bed 
 Would you save me or leave me dead? 
 All the blood I shed 
 And I'll just rest my head
