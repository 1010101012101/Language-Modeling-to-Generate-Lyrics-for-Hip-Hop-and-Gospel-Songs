Jam 
 I got these voices in my ear 
 Aye 
 Yeah, got these voices in my ear 
 Ha 
 Yeah, I got these voices in my ear 
 Yeah (Yeah!) 
 Wake up to the sound of a million horns 
 Jesus piece ruby red diamonds in the thorns 
 Say a prayer for the Jammed and the one's that's gone 
 I might have missed my nigga's wake, but still I mourn 
 Did it big in the club with my cash out 
 But dealing with a lot so I drunk until I passed out 
 With a brawl I met a broad with her ass out 
 Her concern was the earn like "Nigga what yo cash bout " 
 In the ville up on my tip with her glass out 
 We live a paparazzi life, what yo flash bout? 
 Hit the mattress set the ceiling, what yo stash bout? 
 In case I had doubts 
 I got these voices in my ear 
 They tell me get up, get up, get up 
 I got these voices in my ear 
 They tell me wake up, wake up, wake up 
 I got these voices in my ear 
 They tell me keep running, keep running, keep running 
 I got these voices in my ear 
 They tell me get money, get money, get money, get money 
 Breathe 
 What if a dream was all you had 
 And life ain't Fab you can't throw it in the bag 
 Niggas ain't real, hoes ain't shit 
 My hand-me-downs was too big they buying clothes that don't fit 
 I'm like, it was more than fame that the credit 
 Feeling like my whole life I been try'na be the freshest 
 Respected, in a world full of kings you pathetic 
 If you can't buy the finer things before you exit 
 The very moment that'cha got it 
 I swear my biggest fear is that I'll die a nobody 
 Forgotten, when I was really at my best 
 It seems like nothing left 
 Lately I been feeling like fuck it 
 Heavens in my face but Lord knows I can't touch it 
 Plus I heard the angel wings was kind of heavy 
 Scared to put 'em on my back, so I threw 'em on the Chevy 
 Death knocking on my door I can get it 
 Looking through the peep hole in case I ain't ready 
 Fuck this rap shit yeah I said it 
 On the road to the riches ain't no telling where I'm headed 
 Now I dread it, the world ain't what it seems 
 And during all the shit to be a king 
 Praying for tomorrow, some more time to borrow 
 I'm scared, aware, they whisper "never fear"
