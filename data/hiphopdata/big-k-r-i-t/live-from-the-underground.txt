Pushin' rhymes underground like moonshine 
 With jump like juke joints 
 Ridin' like old 'lacs 
 Down like 4 flats 
 Shine like gold grills 
 Curls and chrome rims 
 Bitch you know what it is 
 I'm live from the underground, underground 
 Live from the underground, underground 
 Underground, underground 
 Live from the underground railroad 
 My papa told me get paper, motherfuck a hater 
 Them J's look clean son but elevate to gators 
 I took that shit to heart plus I dug it like a crater 
 I'm givin' out game player are there any takers 
 While you was quarter sackin' I was quarterbackin 
 Callin' plays everyday, level All-Madden 
 Hi five, cloud nine, private jet lackin' 
 Treat the seal like a vinyl record, gotta keep it crackin' 
 Shall I pour up, blow some smoke up, get my spit on 
 Grab a paper, sit on a track and get my shit on 
 Ice cold water with the flow minus the lemon 
 I'm Cinematic Multi, what label you been on 
 Old school ridin' flickin' ashes in the tray 
 Smokin' up the booth blowin' static in they face 
 C.R.E.A.M., cash rules everything around me 
 King, checker board nigga go and crown me 
 Pushin' rhymes underground like moonshine 
 With jump like juke joints 
 Ridin' like old 'lacs 
 Down like 4 flats 
 Shine like gold grills 
 Curls and chrome rims 
 Bitch you know what it is 
 I'm live from the underground, underground 
 Live from the underground, underground 
 Underground, underground 
 Live from the underground railroad 
 Keep it rolled, I'm supposed to lose control 
 Oh no, pop the trunk, burn a skunk and slam a do', do' 
 Window crack on the ave, marinate the scene 
 When I lean and crawl couldn't see me with your high beams 
 Play my part, I got heart, I'm tailor gator sharp 
 Plus we sit taller than Monster trucks in them trailer park 
 My candy coated it cost a grip but I had to blow it 
 Your sides was dusty, my seats is bucket but you'll never know it 
 Forever tinted so you can't peep while your bitch up in it 
 You call her phone she give you tone like "Why you trippin'" 
 Cold blooded ain't it but that's how it be when they want that cash 
 When you ain't around anybody can be in that ass 
 Heard that from 8-Ball homeboy girlfriend 
 If she a bopper then she probably ain't your girl then 
 You claim you pimpin' don't be trickin' wear a curl then 
 And find some paint to put some swirls in 
 I'm pushin' rhymes underground like moonshine 
 With jump like juke joints 
 Ridin' like old 'lacs 
 Down like 4 flats 
 Shine like gold grills 
 Curls and chrome rims 
 Bitch you know what it is 
 I'm live from the underground, underground 
 Live from the underground, underground 
 Underground, underground 
 Live from the underground railroad 
 We goin' live 
 From the underground 
 From the underground 
 From the underground 
 We goin' live 
 From the underground 
 From the underground 
 From the underground 
 We goin' live 
 From the underground 
 From the underground 
 From the underground 
 We goin' live 
 From the underground 
 From the underground 
 From the underground 
 Hey, are you okay down there? 
 Yeah, I'm fine. Where am I? 
 You're in the mainstream. This is A&R-ville. 
 Where are you from? 
 I'm from Cadillactica, by way of the underground. 
 For short, the south
