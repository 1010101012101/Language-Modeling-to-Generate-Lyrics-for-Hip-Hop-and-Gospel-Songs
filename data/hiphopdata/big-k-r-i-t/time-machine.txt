In my time machine, yeah I ride, clean 
 Marinate the scene with my high beams 
 Candy coated dreams, whenever I, lean 
 Take me forward far, this ain't just my car 
 This my time machine (take me way back) 
 This my time machine (take me way back) 
 This my time machine (take me way back) 
 Take me forward far, this ain't just my car 
 This is my time machine 
 (Big K.R.I.T - Verse 1) 
 Take me way back Scarface and a tapedeck 
 Ridin' with my poppa, rockin' a starter and some gray sweats 
 Gave me game as we roll down the 8th street 
 N-ggas out here flexin?, don't be stressing what you can't be 
 And don't be dodgin?, don't believe in what you can't see 
 Unless its borrowed, don't be borrowin? cause ain't shit free 
 You got your family and your friends when you need relief 
 There'll come a time when I can't be there when you need me 
 He lean't my seat back (way, way, back) 
 When it come to music yeah you need that 
 Forever in the cut where you be at 
 Forgive and forget, your anger leave that 
 Don't be wasting time, Cause time is all you have 
 Don't be chasing hoes, Boy go chase this cash 
 I can't say no mo?, you'll learn it on yo own 
 I couldn't understand it then 
 But you know that I'm grown 
 In my time machine, yeah I ride, clean 
 Marinate the scene with my high beams 
 Candy coated dreams, whenever I, lean 
 Take me forward far, this ain't just my car 
 This my time machine (take me way back) 
 This my time machine (take me way back) 
 This my time machine (take me way back) 
 Take me forward far, this ain't just my car 
 This is my time machine 
 (Big K.R.I.T - Verse 2) 
 Take me way back, fitted with a wave cap 
 Rushing in the hallway trying to keep these waves flat 
 Broads come and go rarely would they f-ck with me 
 My brother was a player I was favorite off many streets 
 Learning who's paying dudes made myself a name 
 Laughing at these cape crusader?s, save us 'cause these n-ggas lame 
 Hand cuffin?, claim they lovin' on a freaky thang 
 She a bopper I got partnas that done ran a train 
 We play the game 
 Even as a youngster knew I'd be a king 
 Told them non-believers I would never changed 
 Mississippi is where I'm from and that the shit I claim 
 It's funny how they flock when they heard you got that knot 
 Wouldn't bust it open now they dying to set it, high 
 Down to hit my couch, get off in their mind 
 Like I'm a fall in love, Take 'em back in time 
 In my time machine, yeah I ride, clean 
 Marinate the scene with my high beams 
 Candy coated dreams, whenever I, lean 
 Take me forward far, this ain't just my car 
 This my time machine (take me way back) 
 This my time machine (take me way back) 
 This my time machine (take me way back) 
 Take me forward far, this ain't just my car 
 This is my time machine
