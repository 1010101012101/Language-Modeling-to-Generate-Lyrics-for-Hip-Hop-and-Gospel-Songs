I got no time to waste, I got more bills to pay, I got more mouths to feed, now, now, now, I got no time to play, I got no need to stay, and with no money for round, round, what's a king without a crown? what's a car without some sound? 
 Well I'll be on my civic sucker shit, whether I pimped out 4 doors 
 With a wood grain dashboard, a rim that sits low 
 With an embroided headrest, yeah that be dead fresh, in ya ear like headsets 
 Sleepy I, forever grind, no best rest 
 I can't depend on that next chick 'cause it ain't about shit 
 The type of rope that got me searchin' through my mommas couches 
 With some loose change, I got that dollar menu 
 Mcdouble and a small fry, the lightest sweet tea with blended 
 Now here it is Monday, but it'll get me through till Wednesday 
 It'll kill them hunger pains, even though it ain't fufillin 
 I might do with what god gave me, and I take it day by day 
 I would come around more often but I can't stay 
 Try not to step on my toe, with those soul 
 Bank roll, you blow and roll, on stripper pole pros, you barely know 
 Make it rain 
 If I was paid with no knowledge of two months late on my mortgage in the hood 
 That ain't save I'd do the same thing 
 Our wish for thankin' ain't shit, with our genes 
 I can't define how I feel, that's why I'm searchin for meaning 
 No need to pinch me in my playa sleep, I know when I'm dreamin' 
 My momma tell me be careful, because she know when I'm scheming 
 Lottery winners don't run in my family, Noh threw 7 dice, in one night, ain't no sense in me gamblin 
 We just ?, maybe dare will listen to me if I pull the strap out 
 Now give me everything or imma black out
