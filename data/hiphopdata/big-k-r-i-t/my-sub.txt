 OK I pull up and my partners ask me krizzle where you sub at... 
 Hey fuck them tweeters they ain't beaten, get yo sub back, 
 So I push my pedal to the metal to my 'cause house, 
 He owed me money, fucked that bread just set your sub out, 
 I fly like jets, that candy wet, I'm feeling fuck wit hoes, 
 E.q. these setting's in my Chevy till my trunk explode. 
 Maybe I'm bumping, maybe I'm tripping, Maybe I'm feeling good! 
 Either way I'm quaking, shaking wakin' up the folk in my neighborhood 
 Still hit the scene and whip, pour it up in my cup and sip, 
 Never be where them white folk at 'cause the laws over there they bound to trip, lift it up in my thump and bump, saw a lame and I hit the trunk, 
 Pop that shit like twice for real, niggas gon feel my wisdom still, 
 Chopping these vows too, congrats when I roll through, 
 Back to the backwood where I ride clean like I'm supposed to, 
 Forever whipping on, leather guts with plenty chrome, 
 Knocking pictures down till I get home, 
 I put that on my sub, 
 My sub, my sub, my sub, I put that on my sub! 
 My sub, my sub, I put that on my sub! 
 My sub, my sub, I put that on my sub!

 Now usually, I don't disturb the peace, 
 But I'mma wake you if you sleep, 
 With that quake that bass that beat, 
 Two miles per hour on creep, 
 Smoke make it hard to see, 
 When I'm swanging down, I mean banging down, 
 I ain't playing around wit no freaks, 
 I gotta shake junt in my trunk, 
 Tell my DJ bring it back, 
 Turn it up all the way to the max, 
 Till that old school chevy frame crack, 
 My partner hit me up like he need a ride, 
 But I can't hear him either! 
 Said he got some bags and that's kinda sad, 
 Cause there's only room in here for my speakers, 
 But I'm riding out, like I don't know what he talking bout, 
 Besides he always hating when I'm bassing telling me to turn it down, 
 Hell I just wanna hit a load, I just wanna shake the ground! 
 Lay it down in the parking lot, turn it up outside the club, 
 Can't tell if shawty really digging me, she can shake but she love to suck, 
 Might be the best but I can dig it though, 
 She vibrate, gyrate, and swear that's the reason I did it for, I put that on my sub, 
 My sub, my sub, my sub, I put that on my sub! 
 My sub, my sub, I put that on my sub!
