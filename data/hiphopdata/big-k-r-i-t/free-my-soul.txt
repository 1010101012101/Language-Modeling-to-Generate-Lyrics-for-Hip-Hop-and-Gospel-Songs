Mama I made it 
 Got my chain now, 
 I got that Benz too 
 I got my Luis Vuiton 
 And my Gucci shoes 
 Mama I made it 
 Got the choosy folks I keep some groupy hoes 
 I got that old Skool With those Lambo doors 
 But I am scared (Yeah) 
 It all ain't enough 
 To free my soul 
 Lord mama I made it 
 Fuck what they are talking 
 Na It ain't about talent 
 It's no longer an art 
 Niggers piss on your canvas? 
 And parade 
 Ok so you paved the way but I rolled the road 
 Farther than you rolled before but still you block the road some more 
 I'm on my last leg and they just passing me by 
 With a sign that say I rap to eat and both my thumbs in the sky 
 Damn! When would my time come should I just sell dope 
 For money, 
 Cars 
 Clothes 
 And hoes ... 'cause they say that's successful 
 Till a nigger run up all you and unload 
 'Cause he Po' and you shine just like the Moon glow 
 Stunting in your bently but it cost you your soul 
 When God come to collect I hope you got what you owe 
 Forever dreaming 
 Wishing on a star for help 
 I give a nigger food for thought 
 He rather starve himself 
 Apart from wealth 
 I think it was the shine that got us blinded 
 Not sure of what we reading when we signing (our life away) 
 They say ignorance is bliss 
 But I like to stay 
 The game is just not records and real shit 
 They don't like to play 
 You ghetto famous to us, u just Bo jangles to them 
 Tap your feet tip your brim and sell it back to your kin 
 I don't rap I spit hymns 
 My Gods bigger than them 
 Try to blacken your heart and say were children of men 
 I sin 'cause I ain't perfect 
 But I rather save your life, then hurt it 
 (If I Make It)
