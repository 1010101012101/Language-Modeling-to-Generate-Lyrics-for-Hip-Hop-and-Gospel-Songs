 2000 and beyond 
 2000 and beyond 
 Tricks and hoes, bitches and stripper poles 
 Shake it for dollar signs, let me see from behind 
 The ghetto's a fairytale, pimps and jazzlebells 
 Dealers with chrome rims with products for you to sell 
 Chemistry in the kitchen, alleys with rubber in it 
 Tires go round and round, windows heavy tinted 
 Cush is in the inside, pull me over 
 Now they talkin' 'bout a k9. black man face dine 
 Charge it to game, bums warm their weary souls over open flames 
 Junkie caint find god watch him find his vein 
 Preacher walk by like he ain't seen a thang 
 Pass the collection plate 
 Niggas thought thangs was gonna change on election day 
 Healthcare H1N1 they was sprayed 
 Got me scared to hit the block 
 Wear my flag as a mask tote a glock, in 2000 and beyond 
 In 2000 and beyond 
 In 2000 and beyond 
 Post on, scrape dollars and the last of their income tax 
 On impalas whips, ???, church gives awards to the best dress 
 Have to drive a bentley, got me thinkin', I was the less blessed 
 'Cause I let a middleman, he was cappin wit 'em askin 
 I don't understand, how you fit that many rings on a helping hand 
 Tired of deception, but I pay his tuition 'cause I'm tryna get to heaven 
 Ain't it crazy, scared to have a baby 
 How can I protect it from the same streets that made me 
 Concrete gladiator blood shed overflowin 
 In real life some places russlle crow will never go 
 Pimp tyte flossin, look at what it cost me 
 Peace of mind no sleep late night tossin and turnin' 
 Waitin on the end, pray to god forgive me for my sins, in 2000 and beyond 
 In 2000 and beyond 
 In 2000 and beyond 
 As a child I was cold with a chip on my shoulder 
 Grandma told me becareful cause ther're sharks in the water 
 They will kill you, let the good lord steal you 
 Don't worry 'bout the government 
 Cause baby they don't feel you 
 Martin luther king had dream, we was right there 
 I wonder what he saw when up and had nightmares 
 Quite scared, all the work he had done 
 Couldn't stop what we've become, in 2000 and beyond
