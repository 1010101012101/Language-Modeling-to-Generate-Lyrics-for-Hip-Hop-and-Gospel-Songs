I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here 
 I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here 
 I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here 
 Big backyard with a house on the hill 
 Old school whip with some big ass rims 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes

 Well I suppose niggas gon' hate on me 
 Well that's cool 
 I got shows, getting money I can barely fold 
 Cause that's what I do 
 And ain't nobody gon' pimp K-R-I-T 
 Yeah, that's how I feel 
 And them diamond niggas always rhyming 'bout 
 It's against my will 
 And ain't nobody gon' check none of me or mine 
 In God I trust 
 If you think I'm out here tricking these hoes 
 You got me fucked up 
 And ain't no playing in the south, turn a bad bitch out 
 When I grab my pipes 
 Y'all niggas think this shit came oh so easy 
 It wasn't over night, but 
 I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here 
 I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here 
 I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here 
 Big backyard with a house on the hill 
 Old school whip with some big ass rims 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Now I suppose I'm doing quite all right 
 Ever since I blew 
 Never worry about me or worry about mine player 
 Worry about you 
 And ain't nobody gon' block my shine today 
 With the roof gone 
 I got a top notch bitch, you need something like this 
 But you gotta get your own 
 And ain't nobody gon' wreck this hard 
 When I'm traveling down the boulevard 
 Now they hollering out "Oh my God!" 
 'Cause they never seen rims this large 
 That's country shit 
 Well that's cool 'cause I'm country, bitch 
 I never turn my back, I burn on wax 
 And stack my cash till I'm country rich, cause 
 I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here 
 I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here 
 I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here 
 Big backyard with a house on the hill 
 Old school whip with some big ass rims 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes 
 I got this here, I got this here 
 Chevys on that chrome 
 Live and in my zone 
 Till a player gone 
 I got this here, I got this here 
 Doing it how I feel 
 Doors open for hoes 
 Haters in my grill 
 I got this here, I got this here 
 Diamond in the back 
 Slamming on these doors 
 Trunk beat till it crack 
 I got this here, I got this here 
 Get it how I live 
 Smoking on that good 
 Cracking on my seal 
 I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here 
 I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here 
 I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here 
 Big backyard with a house on the hill
