Screaming at the top of my lungs till God notice me 
 Trying to find my stairway to Heaven where I'm supposed to be 
 Still carrying weapons to get my children groceries 
 One man against the world, black rosary 
 Only feeling hate in heart 
 Pain and poetry 
 My prayers go ignored in the dark, it hurts emotionally 
 Hoping that Lucifiers heart will finally let go of me 
 It's one man against the world 
 Black rosary 
 Screaming at the top of my lungs till God notice me 
 Trying to find my stairway to Heaven where I'm supposed to be 
 Still carrying weapons to get my children groceries 
 One man against the world, black rosary 
 Only feeling hate in heart 
 Pain and poison poetry 
 My prayers go ignored in the dark, it hurts emotionally 
 Hoping that Lucifiers heart will finally let go of me 
 It's one man against the world 
 Black rosary
