I take your mind and I smash it into plasma 
 *Gasp for air* breathe like asthma, till your just a cadaver 
 How fast this is, your faggot crew's a bunch of actresses 
 My skills go back to flippin on pissy matresses 
 Not subroc, I catch you out like matlock 
 Now your name's in the way outdated section next to chubb rock 
 It's kind of funny, some of you cracker DJ's shun me 
 'Cause I make your favorite rappers come up short like bud bundy 
 I'm all in the family, sick like archie bunker, fuckin' eat it 
 Your styles are cheesy like a uncircumcised penis 
 Better jet out, brother out, your r&b I first ignore ya 
 Fuck heavy d, cause "i got nothin' but hate for ya"! 
 I'm chino xl, now who the fuck are you? I'm laughing 
 Smashing you like a bottle of zima 
 Oh now all of a sudden you got emphesema? 
 Burrnt, save that shit for rich verbatim days behind me 
 I'm yellow as hell, but I rip more blackstreet's than teddy riley 
 I'm not environmentally conscious so fuck an earth day on my worst day 
 I could kill more slanted eyes than a Japanese earthquake 
 And in the first place, farrah couldn't fawcett when I lost it 
 Give me that mic, you monkey motherfucker, you look exhausted! 
 When I'm tipsy, cut you like bush cut social security 
 You couldn't make this crowd bounce like they one big silicone tittie 
 It ricochets, hear my name in projects hallways 
 Chino will amaze in so many different ways, what? 
 Fuck that *cough* when I bust that *cough*, watch this 
 I'm knockin' niggaz out like they homosexual boxers 
 Now you feel like a building when the wrecking ball hits 
 I'm the type of nigga bitches like brandy wanna be down with 
 Not howard stern but get your temper burning, make you vomit 
 Blood in slow motion like tyra banks go in higher learning 
 Enema, comma, coma, drama, dilemma, die like dahmer 
 You can't see me like the muppet babies grand - mama 
 I'm a barbed wire condom once fuckin' with that you'll - holler 
 My flows wet shit up like barry white's shirt - collar 
 And I'm smoke bones with mad thugs we be in harmony 
 But da-na-da-da-dah-dah, just doesn't fuckin' appeal to me 
 Disgustin me like greg lougainis aids my style is full blown 
 I'm wild like a latch key kid when his alcoholic daddy ain't home 
 Skip the silly facts is what you really lacks, your city give me daps 
 When chino xl cuts you bleedin to death like hemophiliacs 
 Testin me is heresy I'm ill as leprosy I could make 
 Farrakhan grow dreads (bo bo!) and do the pepper seed 
 Spilling blood, similar to exxon valdez strike like a boa constrictor 
 Pain I inflict ya made ya scream like little richard 
 Battle me, no more props, no more fan mail admiration 
 You die, no time readin that for dramatization 
 You got your contract now you dissin me -- when you 
 Barely own yourself like the adams family electricity 
 Bow your head in praise, the crowd sways when I hit the stage 
 Chino flips a phrase in so many different ways, uh 
 Projecting my east coast semen all over ya (they be cloning ya) 
 I'm leaving 'em starving like they from cambodia (nice knowing ya) 
 I'm telling ya fuck your cellular fuck your skypager 
 None of that can save ya when I slash ya with my rusty razor 
 In need of dry towels, my eye scowls, white owls I split ya 
 Reposing like an arthur ashe before and after picture 
 My crew stay high like astronauts, this yellow bastard rocks 
 Still representin jersey to the fullest -- down at fraggle rock! 
 So now I rips again; leavin' rappers whimperin 
 Makin' my impression left in ears like discarded syringe 
 Cinematogrophy showin slides of your autopsy, no fair 
 I'm turning your whole projects into tiannamen square 
 Not number five like caps bust inside of tupac's side 
 Rap side, not pharcyde, burn your eyes like hydrogen peroxide 
 You better dodge this God that's lookin' like debarge 
 Disgusting like an old white woman's medicinal discharge, swingin' 
 My fist hard, causin viral spinal menengitis, when the slightest 
 Vinyl coincides you risk dying to my violent twist 
 The tin ma -- if I only had a heart! I wouldn't make 
 All y'all niggaz sit in the backseat like fuckin' rosa parks 
 I represent them niggaz that make you one healthier 
 While you represent bad niggaz like denzel in philadelphia 
 I ruin more brothers with skills careers than don king, yo 
 Yo b stop the track here the phone is ringing I hear the phone ringing 
 *Phone rings* 
 Yo? "yo chino you look so good! 
 I just know you gotta a big dick 
 I wanna fuck you so bad!" 
 Oh seven no one seventy the zip code I don't give a fuck 
 Throw an uppercut, was getting xl all fired up 
 Worth getting your jaw all wired up? 
 Be a man like me'shell n'degeocello, receive your ass-beating 
 I perform in front of more sellout crowds than a naacp meeting 
 I'm making MC's look dumber and dumber like jim carrey 
 Go dig for david cole I'm back in office like marion barry 
 My crew parleys while your girl braiding my braids 
 MC's are afraid in so many different ways! 
 "Chino was fly but too fly for me!" --> MC lyte ('cappucino')
