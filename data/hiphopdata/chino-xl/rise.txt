Yeah, sometimes they come back 
 High pitched shrieks, my body lie dead in the streets 
 Yeah, my body lie dead in the streets 
 The darkened clouds reflect my inner confusion 
 Frustrating feelings of dying too soon and I'm 
 Sitting in plain view of Master and all of his glory 
 In purgatory, I'm not your everyday sinner 
 It's often viewed as stepping into a great light 
 With shadows of time, some people are forgotten in life 
 Move in past situations, stolen moments frozen proving 
 You ain't had a thing but evil in your human heart 
 It's startling, but I keep on following 
 The pain is mind-boggling, I hear angry souls hollering 
 High pitched shrieks, my body lie dead in the streets 
 Crackheads searching through my pockets too I see this all from side view 
 Now as I stand in the judgment of my forefathers 
 They agree I was murdered without my goal accomplished 
 Inside my heart is where the curse lay scared in the worst way 
 Like a savior on the third day, I rise 
 "Feel my aura, just around death's corner"
