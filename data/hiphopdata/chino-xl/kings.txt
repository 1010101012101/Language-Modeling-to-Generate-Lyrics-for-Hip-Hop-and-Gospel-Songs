[Verse One][Big Pun]: 
 Why you rhymin like you killin' niggas 
 You ain't never feel a trigga 
 Screamin that you real but y'all still beginners 
 I make examples out you ample rappers 
 Smack you make you trample backwards 
 Catch you fallin' flat than strap you back in pampers 
 That's a sample just to let you know 
 Test me and invest in souls 
 Specially on some flesh meat, never left on skulls 
 No supposin' holding grudges you'll be holdin' crutches 
 Motherfuckers blastin' me that's blasphamy, I'm old to roughage 
 Who's the toughest as rough as they come 
 I'll snuff 'em anyone of ya bluffin' 
 My name ain't Punisher for nothing 
 Keep huffin' and puffin', I blow your face in 
 When me and Seis and my ace in the hole lyrical assassin be Triple Seis and 
 Chasing popo outta puerto town 
 Loco till I part the ground 
 In my coffin, tossed in, to the lost and found 
 Down and deep beneath the weather in my leather jae 
 Six feet forever, half asleep Bronx niggas never die

 "The term Chino's Latin 
 But I got black soul 
 Flows I creates "Unforgettable" like Nat King Cole" - 'No Complex' Chino XL 
 The king 
 "I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull 
 Master the flow, niggas be swearin I'm blacker than coal/Cole 
 Like Nat King" - "Dream Shatter" - Big Pun 
 Two of the illest that you've ever seen 
 True Puerto Rican kings 
 Big Pun in Heaven making angels sing 
 (The king) 
 Chino is still in the physical 
 Making your name ring 
 This collaboration is biblical, mythical, insane 
 Feeling the pain of any latin artist we brought change 
 Before the game was even called a game in the harshest rein 
 These two talented Tieno monsters maintain 
 Chino and Big Pun, a true lyricist dream

 [Verse Two] [Chino XL]: 
 Capital X, capital L 
 Slapping the veil over your grill 
 Slapping the world 
 I was found in a church well 
 Charred body smell going up your nostril 
 Burn myself with lit cigarettes 
 Practicing for fires in Hell 
 Still can't believe Christopher Rios is gone 
 I feel like beating these wack niggas to death with Big Punister's tombstone 
 Something sacred, pumping hatred, nothing shaken 
 Conversations how insatiable, villainous, untasteful impatient 
 Abrasive abusive like Gary Busey carry an uzi 
 Rubies and Kool G 
 Chewy and Goochie 
 Angry and moody 
 My life's a horror movie 
 Y'all don't move me, go 'head shoot me 
 Murder malicious, you sleep with fishes, slice ya to sushi 
 I would've thrown Fred Astaire down a flight of stairs 
 I'm ghetto as having a fly strip for a chandelier 
 Eeeeh 
 Then dying, better stand clear 
 I'm Will.i.am to Wyclef, had a dredded beginning career 
 So Shakira Shakira feel the fear of God 
 I spit it hard in the fog 
 Flow is odd, my mic's religious as a synagogue 
 There's a lot at risk 
 Open your lungs like Primatene Mist 
 Spit it numb my lips like I sniffed a ton of Vicks 
 I'm from a bottomless abyss 
 Where the white kid exist 
 Of a rifle that's fair 
 Shooting out cares till my hands is breaking off at the wrist 
 My hate is outta order 
 Slaughter, but visual as drag queen pictures of Oscar Dela Hoya
