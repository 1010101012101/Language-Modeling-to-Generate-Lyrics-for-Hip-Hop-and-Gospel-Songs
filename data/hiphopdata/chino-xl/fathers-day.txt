Yeah 
 Question, why're we on the fourth floor? 
 I asked her mother, but we both or weren't sure yet 
 This is where the doctor said that we should go 
 Holding my child, she's 10 months old 
 The hospital was so cold 
 Definitely ruining all of our holiday plans of beach sands 
 Filling out some bland paperwork with shaky hands (lost) 
 Seeing little children stricken with a certain sickness 
 Clutch my baby a little tighter reflect of nervous feelings 
 A whole hour passed, we starting to lose patience 
 Humbled by the thoughts of patients lost in this situation (what's going on?) 
 Here comes a nurse, not knowing that we should fear the worst 
 Seen the doctor's mouth moving, couldn't even hear the words 
 This isn't happening to you, I'm like Superman 
 And I could protect you from anything, I was really scared (serious) 
 I realized what I heard but not prepared for 
 The sentence that the doctor said, "Your daughter has cancer" 
 I will take my life right now 
 If you would save my child 
 I'd change my life for her 
 This is my solemn vow 
 No more chemo in her veins 
 And no more screams of pain (I pray) 
 This is a father's shame 
 That I can't save you from everything 
 Okay I got to man up 
 It hit me so hard, that I could barely stand up (my world stopped) 
 Then the flowers and balloons and the cards came 
 Prayers many hours, knees bruised all in God's name (hurt so much) 
 If only my feeble hands could remove this neuroblastoma tumor from your adrenal glands (helpless) 
 Why you?! Why now? It didn't feel fair 
 Your grandma shed tears, you lost your hair 
 It's unbelievable little Bella was that strong 
 And inconceivable we lived in the hospital that long (forever) 
 Protecting your immune system from contaminants 
 You had to wear a medical mask, can't give my kid a kiss (imagine) 
 I learned to envision your face growing getting older 
 Envisioned you driving your first car and getting your diploma 
 Envisioned your wedding, your husband better be a soldier 
 A little girl sick like you died two row's over (Eva) 
 I will take my life right now 
 If you would save my child 
 I'd change my life for her 
 This is my solemn vow 
 No more chemo in her veins 
 And no more screams of pain (I pray) 
 This is a father's shame 
 That I can't save you from everything 
 Chemotherapy made Christmas hard to process 
 I fed the family faith, hoping it would make their fears starve to death 
 Your momma's tough, prayed to Saint Jude's that it's a bad dream 
 But could it be I'm speaking to a doctor and not Epstein (reality) 
 I remember the cries, remember the meals fed through tubes 
 Pulling the red wagon, the sound of the plastic wheels 
 Kind of a metaphor for pulling through this ordeal 
 I pray my enemies never even have to know how this feels (hurts) 
 But forget our feelings it doesn't matter, you're the one suffering 
 You couldn't speak a lot yet but it's like your eyes was saying 
 "Daddy, if it's an obstacle, and price I got to pay 
 For a long, great life, then we'll make it through okay." 
 The day of your final surgery, I still live in that moment 
 The teddy bear you were holding, I still own it 
 I watched the doors closing, February 2,2004... 
 My little girl is cured 
 (Voicemail from Daughter) 
 My God 
 I will take my life right now 
 If you would save my child 
 I'd change my life for her 
 This is my solemn vow 
 No more chemo in her veins 
 And no more screams of pain (I pray) 
 This is a father's shame 
 That I can't save you from everything
