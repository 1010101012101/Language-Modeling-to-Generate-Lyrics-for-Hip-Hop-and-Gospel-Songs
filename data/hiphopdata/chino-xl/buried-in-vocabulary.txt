(Verse 1 - Julius Luciano) 
 I snatch the mic from you clowns, refuse to wait my turn 
 This is the art of emceeing, to who it may concern 
 I'm loony, wait, disturbed, I act like I truly can't discern 
 Right from wrong, ignite the chrome, you stupid lames get burned 
 The gat claps, call the llama gonorrhea 
 Brrap, that's onomatopoeia, now your crew gets places in urns 
 I kick styles, I didn't need the kudetai to learn 
 The world is mine, I'm the son of the dude who makes it turn 
 I'm God's descendant, I'm exceptionally clever 
 Immaculate conception, like my inception was better 
 Him, yeah, I'm him, my perception is extra-sensory 
 Consider me perfection's successor 
 Rappers pray to me, not in the direction of Mecca 
 I'm outside the matrix, I'm in the Nebuchadnezzar 
 We real MC's connecting together 
 From the garden state to the golden state, our depth can't be measured 
 (Verse 2 - Demetrius Capone) 
 Rough and raw crank, clutch my balls, wait 
 I'm balls deep in your mind, fuck what y'all think 
 You in some deep shit like you crawled out of Shawshank 
 I'm shot calling like I shot the ball and I called 
 Bank 
 This is that murder, murder, mu-murderous murder show 
 I'm an insurgent in surgeon, 'cause with this burner I'm surgical 
 Call my weapon the special olympics cause that .38's a pro 
 You turned into the fuck'm station, name it FM radio 
 My gun will draw and stutter, blucka blucka, raw and gutter 
 I'll go call your mother and that slut'll swallow all my nut up 
 Till she cough my son up and that fucker is also your brother 
 I do him like Brenda, niggas get tossed in a dumpster 
 Make no mistake, I'm the greatest atheist, niggas know me 
 As they say pray or I'm making you niggas holy 
 Faker than silicon 
 You gay cause you niggas only going in on some shit when you raping your little homie 
 (Verse 3 - Dice) 
 You niggas thinking you're sick, come get your flu shots 
 After shots flew, drop you then your crew drop 
 I'm letting a couple more fly, call that a new fly 
 Shots might break south, bullets through ya tube socks 
 I'll squeeze the mac, leave you flat 
 Become a thing of the recent past 
 The only time your family sees you is when they dreamin', thinking back 
 Heat'll clap, leave you cats leaking for thinking and speaking bad 
 Put you niggas asleep in a bag, and I ain't speaking sleeping bags 
 You say you on top of the city, like you Nino Brown 
 I'm able to leap tall buildings in a single bound 
 My shots leave your head spinning, fuck drunk or tipsy 
 I'll pull up, niggas break like the lunch truck is with me 
 I'll leave a punk chump slumped, such a fucking pity 
 I fuck monastery bitches, nuns fucking with me 
 (Verse 4 - Kenny Siegel) 
 Hold a sec, I'mma thumb through my mental rap rolodex 
 And assrape dummies, crash test dummy, I'm known to wreck 
 You make me sick to my stomach, your flow upsets my solar plexus 
 I'll blow the tech, now you inhale like you trying to hold ya breath 
 Nigga, I'm about as bad as your luck from a mirror crack 
 I'll twist a nigga's head near his back till I hear a snap 
 These niggas so soft that they gushy (less dangerous) 
 Yes, wankstas, (they rookies), sex changes, (fake pussies) 
 My flow is hot and liquid, it belongs in a f'n thermos 
 Toxic hot spit, send you niggas epidermis 
 Test and learn that death is hurtin' 
 Get urked when Tech's is burstin' 
 Get murked when weapon's spurtin' 
 Leave holy as a reverend's sermon 
 I got these niggas wondering, how could a villain be so nice 
 I don't mean the internet, when I say I'm killing them on site 
 I'm dope, I'm great white, a great white from the beach 
 Want beef? The clips to my pistols all that's gonna come in peace 
 (Verse 5 - Chino XL) 
 I'm spinnin' it intricate, I belong to a sin syndicate 
 With infinite ways of killin' shit, and discriminately I am different 
 Magnifically significant, specifically causing pestilence 
 I'm the infamous, God's instrument 
 Chino born of a hideous chrysalis with pistol whips 
 No questions, my impression is you feelin' nervousness 
 See heaven and hell, both ignoring your prayers 
 Keep talking, motherfucker, I'm killing your parents 
 Every nightmare got a Chino appearance 
 Ghetto vampire, no reflection in the mirror 
 Turn your lights off, it's about to get serious 
 This is the type of song that'll make you change careers 
 Spiracy, teracy, Heracy, jealousy, loonacy, menacing 
 Energy, fantasy, medicine, pedigree 
 And I see hemorrhaging enemies (?) banishing 
 Like venom and I take advantage of 'em 
 You can bet that I be cuttin' like a man rushin' 
 Everybody wanna kill a Puerto Rican 
 ? 
 Chino's an animal outside your castle with catapults 
 From mass assaults with more soldiers and dogs than any land can hold 
 Raw, ancient, flaming fire crossbows through air and fog 
 Tear apart the endless walls and tears and scars and weird remarks 
 Pray I'm lost beneath the forest, stinkin' corpse deep in the morgue 
 But the beast evolved, speak to God, and she's my [?] 
 ? 
 My work ethic is epic, ethnic, eccentric, electric 
 Unexpectedly eclectic 
 It's nothing to get the women naked 
 I'll hop in a time machine and petition your birth 
 And get it signed by anyone that will ever walk on the face of this Earth 
 Not Luciferian, stop worrying about this brother Chino 
 That's unnecessary like fertility drugs in Puerto Rico 
 You're now witnessing the RICANstruction experience 
 Change my name to miscarrage, 'cause I'm the sickest period
