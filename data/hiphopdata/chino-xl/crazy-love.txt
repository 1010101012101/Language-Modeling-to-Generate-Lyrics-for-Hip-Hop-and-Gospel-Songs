[Verse One]: 
 Was whipping a Benz through Bel Aire 
 Looking like shawty off of Slumdog Millionaire 
 She asked me where I been all her life 
 Well since you think I was born yesterday I guess our timings just right 
 Every night, staying at eachother's house 
 I call her coupon, she make me want to cut the bullshit out 
 Independent brand, skinny waist 
 As she slept, ass fat 
 Practically no covers left on my side of the bed 
 Deep after a couple of weeks 
 Asking about past freaks, beefing like Nas and Kelis 
 Bust windows out my car like Jasmine Sullivan's song 
 I ain't know whether to marry her or kidnap her noisy mom 
 We off an on until the coffin 
 If I lost her I'd be blue like the homie from The Watchmen 
 That mixture of love and hate that'll make you levitate 
 But pray for asthma 'cause I think about her every time I breathe 
 For real 
 "To the world" 
 I'm kinda confused it's the craziest 
 "To the world" 
 Am I king or a fool, it's the craziest 
 [Verse Two]: 
 Packs a pink pistol in her purse 
 She makes the cutest mean little frown when I spit a verse 
 Just looking at her always keeps me on hard 
 Rub her back, bubble baths, Cinemax After Dark 
 We argue, she thinks everything is my fault 
 But the shit that really turn me off is when she slick talk 
 She know my past, know I'm capable of no good 
 While your nerd bitch makes you sit and watch The Notebook 
 Jealousy and bad temper 
 We two mechanical toys that's trying to wind up together 
 I hit it like I'm never gon' get it again 
 The kitchen, the den, the top of the washing machine on spin 
 I'm her zombie when she's nude 
 So jealous she'll probably follow me into a confession booth 
 Even the father told me she loved me 
 But said, "Get a veternarian, you both are sick puppies." 
 "To the world" 
 I'm kinda confused it's the craziest 
 "To the world" 
 Am I king or a fool, it's the craziest 
 [Verse Three]: 
 Pleases me in all instances 
 So I'm so not experimenting with no mistresses 
 Even when we disagree we still hold hands 
 Somebody try to play me, she'll damn near kill a man 
 I told her I was working she said, "Prove it yo." 
 Then showed up with a camera crew of Cheaters to the studio 
 So maybe I am suicidal 
 But we are beautifully bound together like pages of an old Bible 
 Shoe game up and she cooking tight 
 She give the kind of head you wanna look forward to every night 
 She inspires me and never breaks her promises 
 Without her my life would be in ruins like archaeologists 
 I figure it's God's design 
 Like Sade's records, she's only got better with time 
 She's still crazy but it's minor 
 Now we got a little baby girl that looks just like her that I love 
 "To the world" 
 I'm kinda confused it's the craziest 
 "To the world" 
 Am I king or a fool, it's the craziest
