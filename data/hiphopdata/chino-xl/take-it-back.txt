[Sample]: 
 "All things in there time" 
 I'll take you back fifteen years, analyze 
 Every verse is cleaner than a surgeon's hands when they've been sanitized 
 I'll take you back to the panic when rap was dangerous 
 Blasting EPMD outta them classic Jeep Wrangler 
 I'll take you back to a different time 
 Spazzing like River Phoenix outside of the Viper Room the night he died 
 Back to paying dues spitting Littelfuse 
 With the mathematical, aeronautical cynic mind of Howard Hughes 
 Abnormality, I'll take it back to originality 
 If I'm insane then rap is my insanity 
 I'll take it back like an Indian giver 
 Yo scratch that term, I'd rather throw a White cowboy in the river 
 I'll take it back, full rage 
 Performing How You Like Me Now with Kool Moe Dee right up on the same stage 
 Let's get it back to the basics 
 Zookeepers need to put a diaper on Chino when he goes ape shit 
 Hip-hop is a great ship, let me steer it 
 My skill level's so high that when I rhyme only dogs hear it 
 The ghetto vampire that's walking in the sunlight 
 The lyric Christ, I turn entire blocks to mass grave sites 
 I will brolic Brock Lesnar your career 
 Chino got more Seoul than the capital of Korea 
 I'm bringing wind storms, rain, darkness and drear 
 Punture heart valves, painting nightmares in blood smears 
 98, I'd like to take it back 
 Still only attract women that think murder's an aphrodisiac 
 A lot of cats that just hopped into this artform 
 Like photographers that never stepped inside a darkroom 
 I'll take it back to when I wanted to be Tito from the Fearless Four 
 The illest Puerto Rican I had ever saw 
 Studied Cool J, studied Kool G, studied Ice-T 
 Now I meet little homies that say they study me 
 So

 [Verse 2] [Rakka Iriscience]: 
 I'll take it back but still tomorrow for you yesterday cats 
 Matter fact, seldom took it back, I meant to say that 
 I take it back to the original 
 King of style, Kase 2 
 Two good letters with one arm and watch them biters waste you 
 Take it back to unity 
 Rest in peace Bigga B 
 Rob-One, Roc Raida, King Dream, SMD 
 Take it back to 1580 KDAY for the cuts 
 Take it back to only leaving Yo in the Toyota trucks 
 I take it back to fast break, Magic, Worthy, Laker raps 
 Some silently claim, but some violently bang on wax 
 Croker sack house shoes 
 Hats with the golf clubs 
 Back to educated rap 
 Back before we all thugs 
 Take it back to dignity 
 I bet it isn't, promise me 
 Traced 'em back and watch the crack spread Reganomically 
 I'm a full time warrior 
 I'm a war time journalist 
 Earning hazard pay, Rakka's live where the Inferno is

 [Verse Three] [Roc Marciano]: 
 Niggas who order gazelles had all the females 
 Beat tell in the Benz, SCL 
 She smell like TCB gel 
 Treat a freak well 
 'Cause I pay attention to detail 
 Pinky ring long fingernail to hit fish scale 
 But that ain't how we get down 
 I'd rather pull a heist, skip town 
 Up in your wig, I pump six rounds 
 Big rope, Slick Rick style 
 Moet rep 
 '89 Rolex vets 
 Poets, tecs 
 I'm the Polo tech's sweats 
 Coke heads to Pro Keds steps 
 While connects role in the LS with leather head rests 
 My waves laying Indian hemp 
 O.G. revolver like Billy The Kids 
 Squeeze trigs in millennium skid 
 The condominium was big 
 That's that brilliant kid
