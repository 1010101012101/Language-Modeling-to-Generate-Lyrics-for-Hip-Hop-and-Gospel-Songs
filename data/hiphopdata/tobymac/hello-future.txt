 Well, hello, future (Hey), goodbye, yesterday (Yesterday, yesterday) 
 Your grass is greener (Hey) than anywhere I've lain (I've lain)

 Hello, future (Hey), we gon' be okay 
 We gon' be okay

 Hello, purpose, you've alluded me 
 I thought I'd find you in victory (Victory) 
 I scaled the mountain (Hey) just to find nobody beside me 
 Hello, purpose (Hey), don't leave me be 
 Don't leave me be 
 Don't leave me be

 Don't leave me be 
 Hello, Jesus, I hope You understand 
 My last departure was never planned 
 I came up empty with everyone and everywhere I been 
 Hello, Jesus, I'm home again
