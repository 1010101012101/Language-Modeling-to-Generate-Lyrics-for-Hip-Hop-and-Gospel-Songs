No, no 
 You're on? 
 Just deep in it right now 
 I gotta go 
 Hey 
 Had you on my mind, I 
 Had a little time, I 
 Know we kinda overdue 
 Turnin' back the pages 
 To our younger days, yeah 
 I can still imagine you 
 Boomin' like the thunder 
 Chasin' life with wonder 
 With fire that could light a room 
 Bottom kinda fell out 
 Waited for the rebound 
 But you never made a move 
 When life cuts so deep 
 Try and remember 
 You, You're not alone 
 We've all been there (been there, been there) 
 Scars come with livin' 
 You, you're not alone 
 We've all been there, oh (been there, been there, oh) 
 So lift your head, lift your head 
 Lift your head to where your help comes from 
 Yeah, you, you're not alone 
 We've all been there 
 Scars come with livin' (with livin', with livin') 
 Life ain't got no sequel 
 We all broken people 
 The only road to found is lost 
 Oversimplifyin' 
 Ain't no shame in tryin' 
 Passion never counts the cost (counts the cost) 
 Now you won't take my phone calls 
 You won't text me back at all 
 I just want to see you 
 I can't stand to see you gone 
 Yesterday I missed you 
 Yesterday I played your song 
 I'm oversimplifyin' 
 I'm oversimplifyin' 
 (I'm oversimplifying, I'm oversimplifying, I'm oversimplifying) 
 But try and remember 
 You, You're not alone 
 We've all been there (been there, been there) 
 Scars come with livin' 
 You, you're not alone 
 We've all been there, oh (been there, been there, oh) 
 So lift your head, lift your head 
 Lift your head to where your help comes from 
 Yeah, you, you're not alone 
 We've all been there 
 Scars come with livin' 
 Scars come, scars come, oh, scars come 
 Oh, scars come with livin' 
 Scars come, scars come, oh, scars come 
 Oh, scars come with livin' 
 It doesn't matter who you are (who you are) 
 This world gon' leave some battle scars (battle scars) 
 It doesn't matter who you are (who you are) 
 This world gon' leave some battle scars (battle scars) 
 It doesn't matter who you are (who you are) 
 This world gon' leave some battle scars (battle scars) 
 It doesn't matter who you are (who you are) 
 This world gon' leave some battle scars (ooh) 
 You, You're not alone 
 We've all been there 
 Scars come with livin' 
 You, you're not alone, you're not alone 
 So lift your head up (scars come, scars come) (head up) 
 To where your help comes from 
 Lift your head up (scars come, scars come) (head up, head up) 
 Oh, scars come with livin' 
 Lift your head up (scars come, scars come) (lift your head, lift your head, lift your hea-hea-head) 
 To where your help comes from 
 Lift your head up (scars come, scars come) (lift your head, lift your head, lift your head) 
 Oh, scars come with livin' 
 Lift your head up (scars come, scars come) (head up, head up) 
 It doesn't matter who you are (who you are) 
 This world gon' leave some battle scars (battle scars) 
 Lift your head up (scars come, scars come) (lift your head, lift your head, lift your head) 
 It doesn't matter who you are (who you are) 
 This world gon' leave some battle scars (battle scars) 
 It doesn't matter who you are (who you are) 
 This world gon' leave some battle scars
