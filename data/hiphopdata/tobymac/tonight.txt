Hey! 
 Every time I try to go it alone I get shut down, 
 Locked up and held captive in the clutches of my doubt 
 We go back, we go forth, we go back 
 I'm sick with vertigo 
 Weary of my ways, my days 
 My ebbs and flows, so 
 I wanna feel a new day 
 (There's gotta be more than this) 
 I wanna live a new way 
 (There's gotta be more) 
 I wanna feel a new day 
 (There's gotta be more than this) 
 I wanna live a new way 
 (There's just gotta be more) 
 Right here, right now 
 Under the stars, I promise you my heart 
 'Cause it starts tonight! 
 We wanna rise, 
 We wanna touch the other side 
 (It starts tonight!) 
 We wanna soar 
 We wanna reach right out for more 
 (Cause it starts tonight!) 
 We wanna rise, 
 We wanna touch the other side 
 (It starts tonight) 
 We wanna soar, 
 We wanna reach right out for more 
 (Cause it starts tonight) 
 Tonight tonight tonight 
 Tonight tonight tonight 
 Tonight 
 Can't be like any night before 
 Under a sky full of stars 
 With hearts that want more 
 (Tonight) 
 Like a river no dam can hold 
 Bein' driven by a source overflowin' our souls 
 (Tonight) 
 Won't be like any night we've seen 
 It changes everything [e-e-e-everything] 
 Right here right now 
 Under the stars 
 I promise you my heart 
 'Cause it starts tonight! 
 We wanna rise 
 We wanna touch the other side 
 (It starts tonight!) 
 We wanna soar 
 We wanna reach right out for more, 
 (Cause it starts tonight!) 
 We wanna rise, 
 We wanna touch the other side 
 (It starts tonight) 
 We wanna soar, 
 We wanna reach right out for more 
 (Cause it starts tonight!) 
 Tonight tonight tonight 
 Tonight tonight tonight 
 Tonight 
 So let us seize this night 
 Let us make our play 
 It's on like the break of dawn 
 Come what may 
 So let us seize this night 
 Let us make our play 
 It's on like the break of dawn 
 Tonight 
 Tonight 
 'Cause it starts tonight! 
 'Cause it starts tonight! 
 I wanna feel a new day 
 I wanna live a new way 
 (It starts tonight) 
 I wanna feel a new day 
 I wanna live a new way 
 (We want more tonight) 
 We wanna rise 
 We wanna touch the other side 
 (We want You tonight) 
 We wanna soar 
 We wanna reach right out for more 
 (We want more tonight) 
 We wanna rise 
 We wanna touch the other side 
 (We want You tonight) 
 We wanna soar, 
 We wanna reach right out for more 
 (We want more tonight) 
 Tonight tonight tonight 
 (We want You tonight) 
 Tonight tonight tonight 
 'Cause it starts tonight!
