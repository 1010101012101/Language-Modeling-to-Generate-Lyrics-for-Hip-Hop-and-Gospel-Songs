If you gotta start somewhere why not here? 
 If you gotta start sometime why not now? 
 If we gotta start somewhere I say here 
 If we gotta start sometime I say now 
 Through the fog there is hope in the distance 
 From cathedrals to third world missions 
 Love will fall to the earth like a crashing wave 
 Tonight's the night 
 For the sinners and the saints 
 Two worlds collide in a beautiful display 
 It's all love tonight 
 When we step across the line 
 We can sail across the sea 
 To a city with one king 
 A city on our knees 
 A city on our knees 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
 If you gotta start somewhere why not here? 
 If you gotta start sometime why not now? 
 If we gotta start somewhere I say here 
 If we gotta start sometime I say now 
 Through the fog there is hope in the distance 
 From cathedrals to third world missions 
 Love will fall to the earth like a crashing wave 
 Tonight's the night 
 For the sinners and the saints 
 Two worlds collide in a beautiful display 
 It's all love tonight 
 When we step across the line 
 We can sail across the sea 
 To a city with one king 
 A city on our knees 
 A city on our knees 
 Tonight could last forever 
 We are one choice from together 
 Tonight could last forever 
 Tonight could last forever 
 We are one choice from together 
 Family, we're family 
 Oh, Tonight could last forever 
 We are one choice from together 
 You and me, 
 Yeah you and me 
 Tonight's the night 
 For the sinners and the saints 
 Two worlds collide in a glorious display 
 'Cause it's all love tonight 
 When we step across the line 
 We can sail across the sea 
 To a city with one king 
 A city on our knees 
 A city on our knees 
 A city on our knees 
 A city on our knees 
 If we gotta start somewhere why not here? 
 If we gotta start sometime why not now?
