I am tired, I am drained 
 But the fight in me remains 
 I am weary, I am worn 
 Like I've never been before 
 This is harder than I thought 
 Harder than I thought it'd be 
 Harder than I thought 
 Takin' every part of me 
 Harder than I thought 
 So much harder than I thought it'd be 
 But empty's never felt so full 
 This is what love (this is what love) 
 This is what love 
 Feels like 
 This is what love (this is what love) 
 This is what love 
 Feels like 
 Poured out, used up, still givin', 
 Stretching me out to the end of my limits 
 This is what love (this is what love) 
 This is what real love 
 Feels like 
 This is what love feels like poured out, 
 Used up still willin' to fight for it 
 This is what love feels like 
 Yeah, this is what it feels like 
 Like floating confetti 
 The beautiful gets messy 
 When the fall out finds the floor 
 But in the depths of the trenches 
 Is the richest of riches 
 Love is calling us to more 
 This is what love (this is what love) 
 This is what love 
 Feels like 
 This is what love (this is what love) 
 This is what love 
 Feels like 
 Poured out, used up, still givin', 
 Stretching me out to the end of my limits 
 This is what love (this is what love) 
 This is what real love 
 Feels like 
 This is what love feels like poured out, 
 Used up still willin' to fight for it 
 This is what love feels like 
 Yeah, this is what it feels like 
 And now these three remain 
 Faith, hope and love 
 But the greatest of these is love 
 It's worth everything you put in 
 Everything you put in... 
 Love 
 This is what it feels like 
 Poured out, used up, still givin', 
 Stretching me out to the end of my limits 
 This is what love (this is what love) 
 Feels like 
 This is what love (this is what love) 
 This is what love 
 Feels like 
 This is what love (this is what love) 
 Feels like 
 This is what love (this is what love) 
 This is what love 
 Feels like 
 This is what love (this is what love) 
 Feels like 
 Poured out, used up, still givin', 
 Poured out, used up, still givin', 
 Poured out, used up, still givin', 
 Stretching me out to the end of my limits
