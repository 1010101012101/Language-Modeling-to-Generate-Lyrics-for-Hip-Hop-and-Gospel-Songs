I set my eyes to the west, walkin' away from it all 
 Reachin' for what lies ahead, I got my eye on it 
 I see my sweat hit the ground, I put my foot in the block 
 This is the race of my life and I can't wait for this shot 
 'Cause I can feel the wind at my back 
 Chest is pumpin' like a heart attack 
 Feet are movin' and my mind is locked 
 Pressin' on with everything I got 
 I got my eye on it 
 I got my eye on it 
 I got my eye on it 
 Eye on it 
 Eye on the prize 
 I got my eye on it 
 I got my eye on the prize 
 I got my eye on it 
 I got my eye on the prize 
 I got my eye on it 
 I got my eye on it and I will not quit 
 I got a new passenger to help me navigate the way 
 So when my heart hits the floor, I can recalibrate 
 I feel the deeper callin' me, all else is fadin' in the past 
 So let me run in the race that I know is built to last 
 'Cause I can feel the wind at my back 
 Chest is pumpin' like a heart attack 
 Feet are movin' and my mind is locked 
 Pressin' on I gotta take my shot
