Lookin' for a way out, for a way out 
 I was so caught up that I couldn't find a way out 
 Find a way out, yeah 
 Playin' through my weakness, can I beat this? 
 Can I crack the surface? Send to the deepness, the deepness 
 Oh, where I've exhausted all my ways, all my ways 
 And all the noise begins to fade 
 It's you 
 Then everything else just falls in line 
 You 
 You will always hold this heart o' mine 
 It's you, it's you 
 Lord, it's you 
 Then everything else just falls in line 
 (Aye, aye, aye, aye) 
 It's you, it's you 
 Then everything else just falls in line 
 (Aye, aye, aye, aye) 
 It's you, it's you 
 Then everything else just falls in line 
 I'm into the newness, the new bliss (Bliss) 
 Me and you together, tell me how to loop this, to loop this-this-this-this 
 To go off forever, road of crescendo, goodbye, limbo 
 Like a new day dawnin', show me the window, the window 
 Where I can see it's you 
 Then everything else just falls in line 
 You 
 You will always hold this heart o' mine 
 It's you (you), it's you (you) 
 Lord, it's you (you) 
 Then everything else just falls in line 
 (Aye, aye, aye, aye) 
 It's you (you), it's you (you) 
 Then everything else just falls in line 
 (Aye, aye, aye, aye) 
 It's you (you), it's you (you) 
 Then everything else just falls in line 
 Don't make no sense without you (Without you) 
 Don't make no sense at all (No sense at all) 
 Don't make no sense without you (Without you) 
 Don't make no sense at all (No sense at all, no sense at all) 
 It don't make no sense without you 
 It don't make no sense at all (No sense at all) 
 Don't make no sense without you 
 Don't make no sense at all (No sense at all) 
 I can't do this life without you 
 I can't do this life at all (This life at all) 
 It don't make no sense without you 
 It don't make no sense at all (No sense at all) 
 (Aye, aye, aye, aye) 
 It's you (you, you, you) 
 (Aye, aye, aye, aye) 
 It's you (you, you, you) 
 Then everything else just falls in line 
 You (you) 
 You will always hold this heart o' mine 
 It's you (you), it's you (you) 
 Lord, it's you (you) 
 Then everything else just falls in line 
 Ain't no one else 
 Ain't no one else will do 
 It's you, it's you 
 Then everything else just falls in line 
 Ain't no one else 
 Ain't no one else will do 
 It's you, it's you 
 Then everything else just falls in line 
 Don't make no sense without you 
 (Ain't no one else, ain't no one else will do) 
 Don't make no sense at all 
 (It's you, it's you) 
 Don't make no sense without you 
 (Ain't no one else, ain't no one else will do) 
 Don't make no sense at all 
 (It's you, it's you)
