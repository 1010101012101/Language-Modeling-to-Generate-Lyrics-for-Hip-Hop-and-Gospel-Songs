 1, 2, 1234 
 When I sit back and imagine 
 Life without you I can't fathom 
 How I ever though I'd make it on my own (on my own) 
 And there's at least a million reasons 
 I'm still standin' here believing 
 You're my comfort 
 You're my healin' 
 This I know, (This I know This I know) 
 When ya can't see the wind but it moves the leaves 
 From the bottom to the top 
 Of the tallest trees 
 You are everything I will ever need 
 And they can't take that from me 
 Oh I feel it in my heart 
 I feel it in my soul 
 That's how I know (oh oh oh ohah) 
 You take our brokenness 
 And make us beautiful 
 Yeah, that's how I know 
 That's how I know (You can't take that from me) 
 Love came crashin' in 
 Never gonna be the same again 
 Yeah, you came crashin' in 
 You wrecked me 
 You wrecked me 
 Love came crashin' in 
 Never gonna be the same again 
 Yeah, you came crashin' in 
 You wrecked me 
 You wrecked me 
 Everybody talkin' like they need some proof 
 But what more do I need than to- feel you
