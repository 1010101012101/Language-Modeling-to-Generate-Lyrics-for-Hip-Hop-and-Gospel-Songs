Yeah! Trudeezy! For the two thousand and tweezey! So all you player haters. Hate the player, not the game, baby! 
 We gon' lay it on ya make it loud and clear! 
 All o' my shorties whether far or near 
 Since the last (Trudog) it's been three long years 
 So we gon' make it loud, we gon' make it loud and clear 
 Gonna make it clearer than a southern California day 
 And even louder 'cause the song I sing'll neva fade 
 And if you thought the T-R-U-D-O-G-10 was in, 
 Listen to me you don't even know me 
 This is just beginnin' 
 Ten year veteran, servin' up the medicine! 
 I rock 'em like you rock a trike, oops! 
 Ya daiper's wet again, UH! 
 Truett? 
 What?

 Dadddy... 
 We gon' lay it on ya make it loud and clear! 
 All o' my shorties whether far or near 
 Since the last (Trudog) it's been three long years 
 So we gon' make it loud, we gon' make it loud and clear 
 We gon' lay it on ya make it loud and clear! 
 All o' God's soldiers whether far or near 
 Since the last (Trudog) it's been three long years 
 So we gon' make it loud, we gon' make it loud and clear 
 Truett...? 
 What? He's the one that wanted to have a free-style battle! 
 Truett, he's three years old. 
 Well, maybe that's why he got served. 
 Oh, and for the record, its don'thate the player, hate the game. 
 Oh.
