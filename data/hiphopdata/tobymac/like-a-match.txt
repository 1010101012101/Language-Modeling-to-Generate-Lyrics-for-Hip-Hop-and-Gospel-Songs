I keep hearin' people say, I need a getaway 
 We got that getaway that takes 'em to a whole new place 
 Won't leave us empty, won't leave us craving more 
 We found that fulfillin' fire that they been lookin' for 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 If it's real, we gotta show it 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 'Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it 
 You and me, we gotta love 
 Hold nothing back 
 You and me, we gotta love 
 Strike it up, like a match 
 Burnin' for the world, we're 
 Burnin' for the world 
 Burnin' for the world to see 
 You and me, we gotta love 
 Strike it up, like a match 
 Ever tasted something sweet knock you off your feet 
 Or bumped a song, all night long kept it on repeat 
 I call up all my friends, I gotta let 'em in 
 I tell 'em, "take a drink of this and never thirst again" 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 If it's real, we gotta show it 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 'Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it 
 You and me, we gotta love 
 Hold nothing back 
 You and me, we gotta love 
 Strike it up, like a match 
 Burnin' for the world, we're 
 Burnin' for the world 
 Burnin' for the world to see 
 You and me, we gotta love 
 Strike it up, like a match 
 That's who we are, who we are 
 That's who we are oh oh oh oh 
 That's who we are, who we are 
 That's who we are oh oh oh oh 
 If it's real, we gotta show it 
 'Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it 
 If it's real, we gotta show it 
 'Cause if it's not, they sure gonna know it 
 They gonna know it 
 You and me, we gotta love 
 Hold nothing back 
 You and me, we gotta love 
 Strike it up, like a match 
 Burnin' for the world, we're 
 Burnin' for the world 
 Burnin' for the world to see 
 You and me, we gotta love 
 Strike it up, like a match 
 We gotta love, love 
 (Ooh) 
 Strike it up like a match
