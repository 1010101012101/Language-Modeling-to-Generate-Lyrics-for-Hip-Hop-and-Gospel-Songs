(Intro - tobyMac) 
 'Cause we all make mistakes sometimes 
 And we all step across that line 
 But nothing's sweeter than the day we find 
 We find 
 (Verse 1 - tobyMac) 
 It's hanging over him like the clouds of Seattle 
 And raining on his swag, falling deeper in the saddle 
 It's written on his face, he don't have to speak a sound 
 Somebody call the 5-0, we've got a man down 
 (Hook - tobyMac) 
 Now you can go and play it like your own rock 'n' roll 
 But guilt does a job on each and every man's soul 
 And when your head hits the pillow with the nightfall 
 You can bet your life that it's gonna be a fight y'all 
 (Chorus - tobyMac) 
 'Cause we all make mistakes sometimes 
 And we've all stepped across that line 
 But nothing's sweeter than the day we find 
 Forgiveness, forgiveness 
 And we all stumble and we fall 
 Bridges burn in the heat of it all 
 But nothing's sweeter than the day 
 Sweeter than the day, we call 
 Out for forgiveness 
 We all need, we all need 
 We all need forgiveness 
 We all need, we all need 
 (Verse 2 - Lecrae) 
 My mama told me what I would be in for 
 If I kept all of this anger inside of me pent up 
 My heart been broken, my wounds been open 
 And I don't know if I can hear "I'm sorry" being spoken 
 But those forgiving much should be quicker to give it 
 And God forgave me for it all, Jesus bled forgiveness 
 So when the stones fly and they aimed at you 
 Just say "forgive them Father, they know not what they do" 
 (Hook - tobyMac) 
 Now you can go and play it like your own rock 'n' roll 
 But guilt does a job on each and every man's soul 
 And when your head hits the pillow with the nightfall 
 You can bet your life that it's gonna be a fight y'all 
 (Chorus - tobyMac) 
 'Cause we all make mistakes sometimes 
 And we've all stepped across that line 
 But nothing's sweeter than the day we find 
 Forgiveness, forgiveness 
 And we all stumble and we fall 
 Bridges burn in the heat of it all 
 But nothing's sweeter than the day 
 Sweeter than the day, we call 
 Out for forgiveness 
 (Lecrae) 
 You know we need that ... that ... that 
 You know we need that ... that ... that 
 You know we need that ... that 
 A-yo, let's talk to 'em 
 (TobyMac) 
 No matter how lost you are 
 You're not that far, you're not too far (from forgiveness) 
 No matter how hurt you are 
 You're not that far, you're not too far (from forgiveness) 
 And no matter how wrong you are 
 You're not that far, you're not too far (from forgiveness) 
 No matter who you are 
 You're not that far, you're not too far (from forgiveness) 
 Ask for forgiveness ... 
 (Chorus - tobyMac) 
 'Cause we all make mistakes sometimes 
 And we've all stepped across that line 
 But nothing's sweeter than the day we find 
 Forgiveness, forgiveness 
 And we all stumble and we fall 
 Bridges burn in the heat of it all 
 But nothing's sweeter than the day 
 Sweeter than the day, we call 
 Out for forgiveness 
 We all need, we all need 
 We all need forgiveness 
 We all need, we all need 
 No matter how lost you are 
 We all need forgiveness 
 No matter how hurt you are 
 We all need forgiveness 
 And no matter how wrong you are 
 You're not that far, you're not too far (from forgiveness) 
 No matter who you are 
 You're not that far, you're not too far 
 We all need forgiveness, forgiveness 
 We all need forgiveness, forgiveness 
 We all need forgiveness, forgiveness 
 We all need forgiveness, forgiveness
