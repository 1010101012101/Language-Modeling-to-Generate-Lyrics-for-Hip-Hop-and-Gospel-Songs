The dream is fading, now I'm staring at the door 
 I know it's over cause my feet have hit the cold floor 
 Check my reflection, I ain't feelin' what I see 
 It's no mystery 
 Whatever happened to a passion I could live for 
 What became of the flame that made me feel more 
 And when did I forget that... 
 I was made to love you 
 I was made to find you 
 I was made just for you 
 Made to adore you 
 I was made to love 
 And be loved by you 
 You were here before me 
 You were waiting on me 
 And you said you'd keep me 
 Never would you leave me 
 I was made to love 
 And be loved by you 
 The dream's alive with my eyes opened wide 
 Back in the ring you've got me swinging for the grand prize 
 I feel the hate is spittin' vapors on my dreams 
 But I still believe 
 I'm reachin' out, reachin' up, reachin' over 
 I feel a breeze cover me called Jehovah 
 And daddy I'm on my way 
 'Cause I was made to love... 
 I was made to love you 
 I was made to find you 
 I was made just for you 
 Made to adore you 
 I was made to love 
 And be loved by you 
 You were here before me 
 You were waiting on me 
 And you said you'd keep me 
 Never would you leave me 
 I was made to love 
 And be loved by you 
 Anything I would give up for you 
 Everything, I'd give it all away 
 Anything I would give up for you 
 Everything, I'd give it all away 
 Anything I would give up for you 
 Everything, I'd give it all away 
 I was made to love you 
 I was made to adore you, made just for you 
 I was made to love you 
 I was made to adore you, made just for you 
 I was made to love you 
 I was made to adore you, made just for you
