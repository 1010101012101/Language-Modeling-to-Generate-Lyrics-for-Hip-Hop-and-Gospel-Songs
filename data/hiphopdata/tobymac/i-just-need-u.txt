Last night put the heavy on me 
 Woke Up and I'm feeling lonely 
 This would gotta a way showing me (showing me) 
 Some Days it'll lift you up 
 Some Days it'll call your bluff 
 Men, most of my Days I ain't got enough 
 And all I Know 
 Is You're my only hope 
 When I'm up when I'm down (uh huh) 
 When the wolves come around (tell me) 
 When my feet it hit the ground 
 I just need, I just need you 
 On my darkest days (uh huh) 
 When I'm Losing Faith (tell me) 
 No, it ain't gon' change 
 I Just need, I Just need You 
 Lord, I need You 
 Yeah, I Just need You 
 Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
 I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me 
 Thy rod and thy staff 
 They comfort me when I'm beat Down, Broken 
 Hold my heart when it's split right wide open 
 Turn these eyes to my Soul Protector 
 Break The Will of this born infector 
 'Cause all I Know, all I Know 
 Is You're my only hope 
 When I'm up when I'm down (uh huh) 
 When the wolves come around (tell me) 
 When my feet it hit the ground 
 I just need, I just need you 
 On my darkest days (uh huh) 
 When I'm Losing Faith (tell me) 
 No, it ain't gon' change 
 I Just Need, I need You 
 Lord, I need You 
 Yeah, I Just need You 
 When You pull me closer, I come to life 
 When I'm up when I'm down 
 When my feet hit the ground 
 On my darkest days 
 No, ain't gon' change 
 Oh Lord, I need you 
 When I'm up when I'm down 
 When the wolves come around 
 Yeah, I need, I need, I need, I need you 
 On my darkest days 
 When I'm losing faith 
 No it ain't gon' change 
 Ain't no way this thing gon' change 
 Is you, I Need 
 Oh my darkest days 
 When I'm losing faith 
 I need you, I need, Is You, I need 
 Every single day, Every breath I take 
 I need You, I need You
