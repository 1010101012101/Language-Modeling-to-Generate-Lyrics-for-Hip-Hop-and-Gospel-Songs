"Dad, uh when we gonna order this Mac?" 
 "You got the cash?" 
 "I'm close." 
 "That's what I thought." 
 I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy, I need a Mac 
 I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy, I need a Mac 
 Them Apples don't grow on trees 
 I want a Mac laptop, packaging so posh 
 Fits like a glove in that tiny little white box 
 Pretty as a picture but it ain't all show 
 At 8 Ram deep I be running logic pro 
 To make my own beats dad 
 Keep me off the streets dad 
 An Xbox, would even take a back seat 
 So please give me a job so I can stack that paper 
 (Rock the beat) 
 'Cause this is major 
 I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy, I need a Mac 
 So I can make my own beats 
 I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy, I need a Mac 
 Them Apples don't grow on trees 
 Yo I'm saving for a laptop and looking for some work 
 5 bucks an hour and I'm willing to serve 
 Ain't no job to UG, L to the Y 
 I'd do almost anything to make that Macbook fly 
 Yo I'll teach Judah to cross it over 
 Then play chess all day with Moses 
 I'll take Leo to the Franklin Fair 
 Dad, I'd even braid Marlee 's hair 
 I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy, I need a Mac 
 So I can make my own beats 
 I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy, I need a Mac 
 Them Apples don't grow on trees 
 I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy, I need a Mac 
 So I can make my own beats 
 I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy, I need a Mac 
 Serving up them Jesus freaks 
 Show me how to do it, drop that beat 
 Show me how to do it, drop that beat 
 I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy, I need a Mac 
 So I can make my own beats 
 I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy, I need a Mac 
 Them Apples don't grow on trees 
 I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy, I need a Mac 
 So I can make my own beats 
 I want a Mac, I want a Mac, daddy, I need a Mac 
 Serving up them Jesus freaks 
 "So you really want to earn a Mac this summer?" 
 "Yessir." 
 "Music for the people." 
 "Yeah man, we got that soul sauce..." 
 "Soul sauce!?!"
