Are we good? Cool. 
 My whole life I've wondered how this wondering heart could turn around it's over now 
 Yeah 
 Imma leave my selfish melodies 
 Wanna be in your beautiful symphony 
 It's over now 
 You sing to me and my heart comes to life 
 Beating for you every time (its beating beating) 
 And now that I hear you oh I love the way 
 Your chorus get stuck in my mind 
 Like a lyric to my favorite song 
 You stick with me all day long 
 And when I've reached the end 
 I wanna hear it again (I wanna hear it again) 
 Like a lyric to my favorite song 
 You stay with me all day long 
 And when I've reached the end oh oh 
 I wanna hear it again 
 Ladies and Gentlemen Jaime Grace 
 While your remix is so surprising 
 Like raindrops when the sun is shining 
 It's beautiful to me 
 Lord you flip my words and change the tempo 
 And somehow you just make it simple 
 So beautiful to sing 
 Yeah you sing to me and my heart comes to life 
 Beating for you every time (its beating beating) 
 And now that I hear you 
 Oh I love the way 
 Your chorus get stuck in my mind 
 Like a lyric to my favorite song 
 You stick with me all day long 
 And when I've reached the end 
 I wanna hear it again (I wanna hear it again) 
 Like a lyric to my favorite song 
 You stay with me all day long 
 And when I've reached the end oh oh 
 I wanna hear it again 
 It's beating beating
