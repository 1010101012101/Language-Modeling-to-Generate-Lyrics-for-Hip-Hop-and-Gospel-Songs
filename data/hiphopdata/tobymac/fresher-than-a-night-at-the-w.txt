Yo, it's me, Tobymac and I don't meanto trouble you 
 I'm feelin' fresher than a night at the W 
 You probably sayin' you be hearin quite enough of you 
 With God and your rhymes and that freaky Jesus stuff you do 
 Like always pushin for that racial diversity 
 Leave us alone were at home in our fantasies 
 I know a guy who knows a guy who has brown skin 
 What in his wallet it so happens I'm around him 
 Well never be that shinin city on a hill y'all 
 Until we show and prove to the people what is real y'all 
 It's like were stale dirty water in the tub of life 
 Gimme a fire that inspires all the world tonight 
 Gimme a fire that inspires all the world tonight
