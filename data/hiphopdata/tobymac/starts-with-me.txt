One day (One day, one day, one day, one day) 
 This nation will rise up (Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up) 
 Rise up (Rise up, rise up) 
 There's a million reasons to hesitate 
 With a history that's filled with hate 
 Have we ever been united states? 
 I wonder (oh, oh, oh) 
 So who can blame us for the doubt 
 Forgive me if I think out loud 
 But we're just as just won't come around 
 I wonder (oh, oh, oh) 
 I was born with two, dirty hands 
 Something my daddy didn't understand 
 Something his daddy didn't understand 
 So it starts with me 
 I was raised with distrust, in my heart 
 Momma told me we're in worlds apart 
 Her momma told her don't even bother 
 So it starts with me 
 'Cause we can be free, yeah I know that 
 Let's try to fix the things that's been broke down 
 'Cause we can be free, yeah I know that 
 And it starts with me 
 'Cause we can be free, yeah I know that 
 Let's try to fix the things that's been broke down 
 'Cause we can be free, yeah I know that 
 And it starts with me 
 With a heavy road in front of us 
 And a system that has lost our trust 
 Can we ever find the strength to rise from ashes? 
 And looking at the heart of it 
 The healing nearly can't begin 
 Without confession and forgiveness and compassion 
 I was born with two, dirty hands 
 Something my daddy didn't understand 
 Something his daddy didn't understand 
 So it starts with me 
 I was raised with distrust, in my heart 
 Momma told me we're in worlds apart 
 Her momma told her don't even bother 
 So it starts with me 
 'Cause we can be free, yeah I know that 
 Let's try to fix the things that's been broke down 
 'Cause we can be free, yeah I know that 
 And it starts with me 
 'Cause we can be free, yeah I know that 
 Let's try to fix the things that's been broke down 
 'Cause we can be free, yeah I know that 
 And it starts with me 
 One day (One day, one day, one day, one day) 
 This nation will rise up (Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up) 
 Rise up (Rise up, rise up) 
 Can you feel it in your heart tonight? 
 Love is gonna move the needle 
 I can feel it in my heart tonight 
 Oh yeah 
 Can you feel it in your heart tonight? 
 Love is gonna move the needle 
 I can feel it in my heart tonight 
 Oh yeah 
 Can you feel it in your heart tonight? 
 (Can you feel it in your heart tonight?) 
 Love is gonna move the needle 
 (Love is gonna move the needle) 
 I can feel it in my heart tonight 
 (I can feel it in my heart tonight) 
 I need you, you need me 
 One more step, almost free (Almost free, almost free) 
 Say I need you, you need me 
 Father give us eyes to see (Ay, ay, ay, give us eyes to see) 
 'Cause we can be free, yeah I know that 
 Let's try to fix the things that's been broke down 
 'Cause we can be free, yeah I know that 
 And it starts with me 
 'Cause we can be free, yeah I know that 
 Let's try to fix the things that's been broke down 
 'Cause we can be free, yeah I know that 
 And it starts with me 
 This language that I speak 
 This dream on you and me 
 But one choice from together 
 It starts with me 
 This language that I speak 
 This dream on you and me 
 But one choice from together 
 It starts with me 
 Now is the time
