Yeah, this is the day we came to get down 
 We came to play the game in your town 
 You came to ride the highs of this junk 
 Baby, we came to guarantee the big crunk 
 So if you or your people ever wanna doubt this 
 Showstoppin', party rockin', tell 'em all about this 
 Crew from the village of the diverse citizens 
 One stop, one shot, livin' like a kid again 
 So turn off the lights 
 They've been waiting all night for the 
 The showstopper 
 The chart dropper 
 The big papa 
 We gonna get it, get it, what? 
 We gonna get it good 
 The showstopper 
 The chart dropper 
 The big papa 
 We gonna get it what, what? 
 We gonna get it good 
 Hope just broke right through the door 
 So why you gotta ask what I came here for 
 Man, we 'bout to light the night with that flare 
 Drop from the gun and the hand need to spare 
 With the kick so hard that you gotta be strong 
 So hot-ta, you can barely hold on 
 So rock me, drop me but you will never stop me 
 From taking this show to the full on monopoly 
 So turn up the lights 
 Pass me the mic 
 Bring on the lights 
 They've been waiting all night for the 
 The showstopper 
 The chart dropper 
 The big papa 
 We gonna get it, get it, what? 
 We gonna get it good 
 The showstopper 
 The chart dropper 
 The big papa 
 We gonna get it what, what? 
 We gonna get it, we gonna get it good 
 It's automatic, don't mind the static 
 I'm a fanatic, Jesus fanatic 
 It's automatic, don't mind the static 
 He's a fanatic, Jesus fanatic 
 Don't mind the static, it's automatic 
 The showstopper 
 We gonna get it, what, what?
