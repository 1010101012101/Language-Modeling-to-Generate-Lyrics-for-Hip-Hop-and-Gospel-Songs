I've always been a dreamer, a soul seeker 
 I knew my life was meant for something deeper 
 You saw me, there's beauty all along the way 
 I've been walking till my feet hurt, holes in my t-shirt 
 Caught me at the Goodwill 'cause you know it's cheaper 
 Only got a few dollars to my name 
 No I, I, I, I'm never gonna stop believing 
 Yeah I, I, I, Imma let 'em know till the day I die 
 We'll lift You up 
 We'll lift You up 
 We'll lift You up 
 'Cause You ain't ever gonna let us down 
 We'll lift you up 
 Till this place erupts 
 We'll lift You up 
 'Cause You ain't ever gonna let us down 
 'Cause You ain't ever gonna let us down 
 Yeah it's been a long road, but Imma still flow 
 I keep pouring out my heart for the people 
 I'll never let the passion fade away 
 And You're the only reason, I'm preaching freedom 
 We'll be turning every eye to the kingdom 
 There ain't no way that'll ever change 
 No, no, no, no 
 No I, I, I, I'm never gonna stop believing 
 Yeah I, I, I, Imma let 'em know till the day I die 
 We'll lift You up 
 We'll lift You up 
 We'll lift You up 
 'Cause You ain't ever gonna let us down 
 We'll lift you up 
 Till this place erupts 
 We'll lift You up 
 'Cause You ain't ever gonna let us down 
 'Cause You ain't ever gonna let us down 
 How many times they need to hear me say it? 
 I'm a freak for You, I'm hear to make you faint 
 Just here to tear it apart, yeah to light up the dark 
 I'm debt free like a bird 'cause You paid the cost 
 So every time I get a mic in the palm of my hand 
 Imma tear the place down like it's my last stand 
 With You as my hill worth dying on, man 
 The only place that I've ever belongs 
 Oh I'm never gonna stop believing 
 Oh, Imma let 'em know, yeah Imma let 'em know 
 We'll lift You up 
 We'll lift You up 
 We'll lift You up 
 'Cause You ain't ever gonna let us down 
 We'll lift you up 
 Till this place erupts 
 We'll lift You up 
 'Cause You ain't ever gonna let us down 
 'Cause You ain't ever gonna let us down
