Party over here, party over there 
 Party everywhere, party everywhere 
 Party over here, party over there 
 Party everywhere, party everywhere 
 Well everybody, everybody in the place to be 
 Open up your mind and let your soul be free 
 I can feel the Most High shining on me, so 
 Let's get this party started 
 Everybody, everybody in the place to be 
 Open up your mind and let your soul be free 
 I can feel the Most High smiling on we, c'mon 
 Let's get this party started 
 Blind-sided by the blitz, come on baby it's on 
 I couldn't wait to get on this, you ain't no quiet storm 
 I wanna tell it like it is, there ain't no stopping us now 
 Somebody shut me up so I can live out loud 
 Well everybody, everybody in the place to be 
 Open up your mind and let your soul be free 
 I can feel the most high shining on me, so 
 Let's get this party started 
 The people thought I was gone, it's been a long time comin' 
 But straight out the box, we got the dark side runnin' 
 So father, Most High won't You show Yourself 
 And shine on this record like nobody else 
 Everybody, everybody in the place to be 
 Open up your mind and let your soul be free 
 I can feel the Most High smiling on we, so 
 Let's get this party started 
 Well everybody, everybody in the place to be 
 Open up your mind and let your soul be free 
 I can feel the Most High shining on me, c'mon 
 Let's get this party started 
 Party over here, party over there 
 Party everywhere, party everywhere 
 Party over here, party over there 
 Party everywhere, party everywhere 
 Well every, everybody, everybody in the place to be 
 Open up your mind and let your soul be free 
 I can feel the Most High shining on me, c'mon 
 Let's get this party started
