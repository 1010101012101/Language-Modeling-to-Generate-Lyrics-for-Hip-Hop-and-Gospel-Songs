One time, one world 
 Two times, one love 
 Three times, rewind 
 'Cause I'ma dedicate this song 
 To every one of God's children 
 Yo, come as you are, come just like you be 
 It's the bumps and curves of our history 
 But no blocks in the road that we can't traverse 
 And no wounds from the past that can't be nursed 
 All hate gonna to dissipate from our fate 
 No check, together, we got a checkmate 
 All hate gonna dissipate and fade away 
 To make room for a brand new day 
 We got one world till it's time to fly 
 So it's one love till we say goodbye 
 We got one world, it's enough to share 
 Till we're called home and we're caught up in the air 
 We got one world 
 I'll look out for you, you look out for me 
 One world 
 Together we can be perfect harmony 
 One world 
 I'll look out for you, you look out for me 
 One world 
 And I'ma dedicate this song 
 To everyone of God's children 
 One world ought to be more than enough 
 And if it's not, is God looking in pure disgust? 
 Wondering, what the dilly with the silly I see? 
 When I made each of these in the image of me 
 Everyday is a chance for a new stance 
 Like every song is the beginning of a new dance 
 And everyone of us was made to reflect the light 
 And glorify the most high, so bright 
 We got one world till it's time to fly 
 So it's one love till we say goodbye 
 One world, it's enough to share 
 Till the king calls us home and we're caught up in the air 
 We got one world 
 I'll look out for you, you look out for me 
 One world 
 Together, we can be perfect harmony 
 One world 
 I'll look out for you, you look out for me 
 One world 
 And I'ma dedicate this song to everyone of God's children 
 You can come as you are, love is yours, love is ours 
 I am a witness, sweet forgiveness, you will shine like a star 
 It's burning bright where you are in our one world, one world 
 One world 
 Like a star, baby 
 One world 
 And I'ma dedicate this song, dedicate this song 
 One world 
 I'll look out for you, you look out for me 
 One world 
 Together we can be perfect harmony 
 One world 
 I'll look out for you, you look out for me 
 One world 
 And I'ma dedicate this song, dedicate this song 
 Let's come together and love 
 Let's come together and love 
 Let's come together and love 
 Let's come together and love, come together
