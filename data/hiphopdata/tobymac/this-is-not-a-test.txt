Fell out of the sky 
 Hit the ground runnin' 
 The future is tonight 
 They'll never see us comin' 
 Takin' by this urgency 
 Won't let this moment pass 
 The Kingdom is alive 
 We're steppin' on the gas 
 We're checkin' in, so check it out 
 We're droppin' in 
 There ain't no stopping us now 
 We've only got one shot 
 Gonna to take it now 
 Goin' all in, gonna make it count 
 Won't look back, gonna set my eyes 
 'Cause there ain't no practice runs in life 
 This is not a, this is not a test 
 This is the real thing 
 This is not a, this is not a test 
 This is the real thing 
 We gonna go till we got nothin' left 
 This is the real thing 
 This is not a, this is not a, this is not a test 
 This is not a test 
 This is not a test 
 We're checkin' in, so check it out 
 We're droppin' in 
 There ain't no stopping us now 
 We're breathin' in, we're breathin' out 
 We're droppin' in 
 There ain't no stoppin', stoppin' us now 
 We've only got one shot 
 Gonna to take it now 
 Goin' all in, gonna make it count 
 Won't look back, gonna set my eyes 
 'Cause there ain't no practice runs in life 
 This is life... 
 So don't get left behind 
 This is not a, this is not a test 
 This is the real thing 
 This is not a, this is not a test 
 This is the real thing 
 We gonna go till we got nothin' left 
 This is the real thing 
 This is not a, this is not a, this is not a test 
 This is not a test 
 This is not a test 
 We gonna move, live every second 
 Make it count for you 
 We gonna move, live every second 
 Make it count for you 
 (This is not a test) 
 We gonna move, live every second 
 Make it count for you
