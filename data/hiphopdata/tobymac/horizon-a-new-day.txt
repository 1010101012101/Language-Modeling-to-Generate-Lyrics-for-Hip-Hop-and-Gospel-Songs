I feel the blood rushin' through my veins 
 I'm ready for change 
 They keep tellin' me to stay in my lane 
 But it's screamin' my name (Name, name) 
 My heart is racin' the elements we're facin' 
 Got us pushin' through night (Night, night) (Oh) 
 I feel the pressure, but when we come together 
 We'll journey to the morning light (Light, light) 
 It's our destiny 
 No separatin' us 'cause we're family 
 Beautiful together 
 I do believe we can do anything in His name 
 (A new day) 
 A new day (A new day) is on the horizon 
 (A new day) 
 A new day (A new day) is on the horizon 
 If you can see it, I can see it, we can be it 
 I believe in nothin' gon' stand in our way 
 (A new day) 
 A new day (A new day) is on the horizon (Horizon) 
 Uh, thicker than blood, thicker than earth 
 Soup ties so deep and wide (Wide) 
 There's comin' a day, comin' a day we gonna rise up 
 We won't give up the fight 
 It's our destiny 
 No separatin' us 'cause we're family 
 Beautiful together 
 I do believe we can do anything in His name 
 (A new day) 
 A new day (A new day) is on the horizon 
 (A new day) 
 A new day (A new day) is on the horizon 
 If you can see it, I can see it, we can be it 
 I believe in nothin' gon' stand in our way 
 (A new day) 
 A new day (A new day) is on the horizon (Horizon) 
 Takin' all we are and bindin' it forever (Ever) 
 Together, never severed a song so much deeper than the skin 
 We're in a creator culture, even our names (Even our names) 
 Fall straight into the shadows of the depths of how we relate 
 Our body, our family, different parts but one and the same 
 Spiritual shame again, I can't 'cause the love we have is different 
 You could say what you say 
 But nothin' could stand in the way 
 All the rising on the horizon 
 Open your eyes (Eyes, eyes, eyes) to a new day 
 (A new day) 
 A new day (A new day) is on the horizon 
 (A new day) 
 A new day (A new day) is on the horizon 
 If you can see it, I can see it, we can be it 
 I believe in nothin' gon' stand in our way 
 A new day (A new day) is on the horizon 
 Rise up if you're tired of the replay 
 And fists high if you're ready for a new day 
 Rise up if you're tired of the replay (Hey-ey) 
 Tired of the replay 
 Rise up if you're tired of the replay 
 And fists high if you're ready for a new day 
 Rise up if you're tired of the replay (Hey-ey) 
 Tired of the replay
