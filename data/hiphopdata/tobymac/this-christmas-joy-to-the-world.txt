Woman: 
 Joy to the world 
 Let Heaven and nature sing

 Toby: 
 Now Johny never got his wish on December 25 
 That's what he said when we left the orphanage 
 9 years old, but Johny was an old soul 
 Gonna spend his first Christmas in a real home 
 Showed me a picture that he drew the night before 
 Was a picture of a man standing outside a door 
 I asked him who it was and he said someone I only 
 See in dreams 
 Comforts me when I cry myself to sleep 
 Woman: 
 Father of the fatherless 
 Be with your sons and daughters this Christmas 
 This Christmas 
 Toby: 
 Believe in angels? 
 Johny asked me starin' at the sky 
 I said I do and saw a sparkle in his eye 
 Big brother for the weekend respondin' to the season 
 Took the chance that givin's better than receivin' 
 Two nights, a new family, some holiday cheer 
 We laughed and sang 
 Came on a midnight clear 
 We gave, received, and as we headed to a close 
 We looked to the Heavens and it started to snow down blessings 
 Woman: 
 Father of the fatherless 
 Be with your sons and daughters this Christmas 
 (Toby: You ain't livin' till you choose to give love and joy and peace to one of His) 
 Father let us not forget 
 The children who are all alone this Christmas 
 ( 
 Toby: 
 You ain't livin' till you choose to give, you ain't livin' till you choose to give) 
 Little boy: 
 Religion that God our Father Accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in the distress 
 Merry Christmas Everyone
