Clap your hands, everybody 
 Everybody, just clap your hands 
 Clap your hands, everybody 
 Everybody, just clap your hands 
 Some things money can't buy but a man's gotta to eat 
 Bread don't just fall out the sky and land at your feet 
 I was tryin' to fly high but I ran low like I'm sittin' on E 
 And my well ran dry till You came and made it rain on me 
 You fill my cup up till it overflows 
 And it's the sweetest love that I've ever known 
 So blow it on me, all that I need, down deep in my soul 
 Fill my cup up till it overflows 
 Oh, yeah 
 They say nothin' is perfect, that ain't true (No, sir) 
 'Cause You came and opened these eyes to the glory of You 
 You turned water to wine, you make a new man in me 
 And every time I'm runnin' empty 
 You fill my cup up till it overflows 
 And it's the sweetest love that I've ever known 
 So blow it on me, all that I need, down deep in my soul 
 Fill my cup up till it overflows 
 Overflows 
 Overflows 
 1, 2, 3, 4 
 It ain't a glass half full or a glass half empty 
 It's runnin' over, it can't fit me 
 Down every side through the ground 
 Mo' than enough to go around 
 So come and get it, come and get it while it's hot 
 Come and get it, come and get it nonstop 
 'Cause the only thing sweeter than a love song 
 Is singin' a love that goes on and on and on and on 
 You fill my cup up till it overflows 
 You are the sweetest love, sweetest love that I've ever known 
 So blow it on me, all that I need, down deep in my soul 
 Fill my cup up till it overflows 
 That's what I'm talkin' about 
 Overflows 
 Uh, overflows 
 Clap your hands, everybody 
 Everybody, just clap your hands 
 Clap your hands, everybody 
 Everybody, just clap your hands
