Well, I thought that I had seen most everything 
 And if jaded was a people, I'd be the king 
 So cold to what a brand new day could bring 
 So icy cold to all the wonder that should be movin' me 
 Overthinking you ('Ing you), hot like June (Like June)

 Lost all my worries, feels like Christmas came early (Hey) 
 Yeah, I can stay here day and night and never feel no hurry 
 Needless to mention, Lord, You got my attention (My attention) 
 My eyes are wide with wonder, feelin' for the soul ascension (Woo) 
 'Cause no one else is ever gonna do for me 
 Ever gonna do for me what You'd do for me, yeah 
 Ain't no one ever gonna steal the mystery You put right in front o' me 
 Right in front o' me, yeah 
 You got me on the edge 
 Got me on the edge of my seat

 And I can feel the wonder rushin' over me
