Somedays life feels perfect 
 Other days it just ain't workin 
 The good, the bad, the right, the wrong 
 And everything in between 
 Though it's crazy, amazing 
 We can turn our hearts with the words we say 
 Mountains crumble with every syllable 
 Hope can live or die 
 So speak Life, speak Life 
 Through the deadest darkest night 
 Speak Life, Speak Life 
 When the sun won't shine and you don't know why 
 Look into the eyes of the brokenhearted 
 Watch them come alive as soon as you speak hope 
 You speak love, you speak... 
 You speak Life, You speak Life 
 Some days the tongue gets twisted 
 Other days my thoughts just fall apart 
 I do, I don't, I will, I won't 
 It's like I'm drowning in the deep 
 Well it crazy to imagine 
 Words from our lips as the arms of compassion 
 Mountains crumble with every syllable 
 Hope can live or die 
 So speak Life, speak Life 
 Through the deadest darkest night 
 Speak Life, Speak Life 
 When the sun won't shine and you don't know why 
 Look into the eyes of the brokenhearted 
 Watch them come alive as soon as you speak hope 
 You speak love, you speak... 
 You speak Life, You speak Life 
 Lift your head a little higher 
 Spread the love like fire 
 Hope will fall like rain 
 When you speak life with the words you say 
 Raise your thoughts a little higher 
 Use your words to inspire 
 Joy will fall like rain 
 When you speak life with the things you say 
 Lift your head a little higher 
 Spread the love like fire 
 Hope will fall like rain 
 When you speak life with the words you say 
 So speak Life, speak Life 
 Through the deadest darkest night 
 Speak Life, Speak Life 
 When the sun won't shine and you don't know why 
 Look into the eyes of the brokenhearted 
 Watch them come alive as soon as you speak hope 
 You speak love, you speak... 
 You speak Life, You speak Life 
 You speak Life, You speak Life 
 Somedays life feels perfect
