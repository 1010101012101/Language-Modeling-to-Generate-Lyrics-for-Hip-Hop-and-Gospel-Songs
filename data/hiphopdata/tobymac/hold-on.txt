Wake up to the morning light 
 Wipe away the lonely night 
 Let a brand new day wash over you 
 Wanna see you smile again 
 Show some love to your crazy friends 
 Wipe your tears away, those days are through 
 If you move just a little bit closer 
 You can put your head on my shoulder 
 Yeah, yeah 
 So, baby, hold on 
 Just another day or two 
 I can see the clouds are moving faster now 
 And the sun is breaking through 
 If you can hold on 
 To the one that's holding you 
 There is nothing that can stop this crazy 
 Love from breaking through 
 We're breaking through 
 Whoa, whoa, oh, oh 
 We're breaking through 
 Whoa, whoa, oh, oh 
 Wake up to the rising sun 
 Thank the Lord for the things He's done 
 Lift your eyes to the hope that's ever true 
 Wanna see you smiling, girl 
 You're a light in this jaded world 
 Wipe away those tears, this one's for you 
 Come on, move a little bit closer 
 You can put your head on my shoulder 
 Yeah, yeah 
 So baby, hold on 
 Just another day or two 
 I can see the clouds are moving faster now 
 And the sun is breaking through 
 If you can hold on 
 To the one that's holding you 
 There is nothing that can stop this crazy 
 Love from breaking through 
 And the stars are up, they're shining for you 
 Oh, how the Father does adore you 
 His love will never change 
 And you and I, we were born to follow 
 The hope that will lead us to tomorrow 
 And no one can take it away 
 So baby, hold on 
 Just another day or two 
 I can see the clouds are moving faster now 
 And the sun is breaking through 
 If you can hold on 
 To the one that's holding you 
 There is nothing that can stop this crazy 
 Crazy love from breaking 
 So baby, hold on 
 You see the clouds are moving faster now 
 And the sun is breaking through 
 If you can hold on 
 To the one that's holding you 
 There is nothing that can stop this crazy 
 Crazy love from breaking through 
 You see the clouds are moving faster now 
 The clouds are moving faster 
 You see the clouds are moving faster now 
 And the sun is breaking through 
 We're breaking through 
 Whoa, whoa, oh, oh 
 We're breaking through 
 Whoa, whoa, oh, oh 
 We're breaking through 
 Whoa, whoa, oh, oh 
 We're breaking through 
 Whoa, whoa, oh, oh
