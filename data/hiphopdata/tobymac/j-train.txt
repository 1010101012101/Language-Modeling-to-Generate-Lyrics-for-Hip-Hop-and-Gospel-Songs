Yo, turn me up in my microphone so I can Bless God's people. You know Kirk Franklin 
 And Toby Mac on this gospel train. Now tell me you wanna ride BABY! BABAA! 
 I got a ticket, I got a ticket 
 I got a ticket to ride 
 (I gotta a ticket to ride to the other side) 
 I got a ticket, I got a ticket 
 I got a ticket to ride 
 Ride, ride wanna ride on the J-Train 
 On the J-Train, wanna ride on the J-Train 
 Ride, ride wanna ride on the J-Train 
 On the J-Train, wanna ride on the J-Train 
 Sit back, relax put on your travelin' gear 
 No need to doubt so put aside your fear 
 Destination, out of this atmosphere 
 It's the J-Train baby, we depart from right here 
 No lines to fight no ticket to price 
 I'm rollin' first class 'cause I've seen the light 
 Try as you may but your money can't buy 
 A ticket on the J-Line to the other side 
 I got a ticket, I got a ticket 
 I got a ticket to ride 
 I got a ticket, I got a ticket 
 I got a ticket to ride 
 (I gotta a ticket to ride to the other side) 
 Ride, ride wanna ride on the J-Train 
 On the J-Train, wanna ride on the J-Train 
 Ride, ride wanna ride on the J-Train 
 On the J-Train, wanna ride on the J-Train 
 Now I missed the Train more than once in my life 
 Till the good conductor heard my Momma's cry 
 Hades to Glory in the blink of an eye 
 Hear me now, hear me now while I testify 
 Heard the whistle blow I felt a chill to the bone 
 All aboard is what I heard it I was headed for home 
 Had a reclinable seat but I just had to stand 
 Up on the, "J" all the way to the promise land 
 I got a ticket, I got a ticket 
 I got a ticket to ride 
 I got a ticket, I got a ticket 
 I got a ticket to ride 
 (I gotta a ticket to ride to the other side) 
 Ride, ride wanna ride on the J-Train 
 On the J-Train, wanna ride on the J-Train 
 Ride, ride wanna ride on the J-Train 
 On the J-Train, wanna ride on the J-Train 
 Do you wanna ride say 
 To the other side say 
 If you wanna ride say 
 Get on the freak-line 
 I got a ticket, I got a ticket 
 I got a ticket to ride 
 I got a, I got a 
 I got a, I got a 
 I got a, I got a
