I waited patiently for the Lord. 
 He inclined to me and heard my cry. 
 He brought me up out of a horrible pit 
 Out of the miry clay. 
 You set my feet upon a rock 
 And established my steps. 
 Many will see it and trust in the Lord. 
 Many will hear it. 
 He has put a new song in my mouth (Psalm 40) 
 Praise to our God (the Chief Musician) (X 4) 
 Sacrifice and offering you do not desire 
 My ears you have opened 
 Burnt offering you did not require 
 Then I said "Behold, trust in the Lord." 
 Do not delay, oh my God. 
 He has put a new song in my mouth (Psalm 40) 
 Praise to our God (the Chief Musician) (x 12)
