Convict 
 Up front 
 I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow. 
 Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo. 
 Maybe go to my place and just kick it, like Taebo. 
 And possibly bend you over. 
 Look back and watch me 
 Smack that, all on the floor, 
 Smack that, give me some more, 
 Smack that, till you get sore 
 Smack that, ooh. 
 Smack that, all on the floor, 
 Smack that, give me some more, 
 Smack that, till you get sore, 
 Smack that, ooh. 
 (Akon) 
 Shortie if you wanna ride 
 You can ride on me 
 You can bump heads 
 And collide on me 
 Want beef damn right 
 Can rely on me 
 To ring the Campbell like Naomi 
 Just do that girl 
 And take it on easy 
 Take it all oiled up 
 And all greasy 
 'Bout that time 
 You start that teasin' 
 Way that you droppin' 
 Got me cheesin' 
 But for me you takin' all my money for real 
 I'd rather spend it on you right now 
 Than my homies bail 
 And I can see that's what you made for 
 And ain't never been no lame ho 
 But that booty bought and paid for 
 One move to you on my payroll 
 (Stat Quo) 
 I love when you do it girl 
 Move to it like you used to it 
 Drop it down 
 I wanna put my thing to it 
 To the crib we go 
 Go fast and slow 
 Make it turn like a stripper 
 Slide down my pole 
 Shortie ass so slow 
 Got you boiled like whoa 
 One night with me 
 She wanna marry Stat Quo 
 But I'm like no 
 Let's keep it on the low 
 On occasion let me come through 
 And tap that hole 
 Make it lose control 
 All the girls know 
 That I hit it right at night 
 I'm a pro 
 I only come round to get sexual 
 And she flexible 
 And I'm sexual 
 I might stay around for a longer time 
 Only if only if she can blow my mind 
 I can hurt that murk that work that spine 
 Now she in love and wants to be mine 
 Stat Quo

 Bobby Creek - you know what I'm saying 
 The ice in the watch 
 Reflects the light to her 
 The money quite green 
 And the ice like blue 
 The swag might kill her 
 So I say goodnight to her 
 She don't want me to leave 
 I can see right through her 
 So we dip out 
 Burn one trip back 
 Get low like Caribbean 
 Limbo then go 
 Out like light 
 Baby girl get right 
 Head so slow my hat don't fit right 
 We cruise in the car 
 Or we could take flight 
 The middle of the night 
 Make your body ache like 
 Mike Vick against the Eagles 
 Call myself a king 
 'Cause I'm regal 
 To be this hot is not legal 
 But we don't care 
 Listen baby it's a fact 
 That 
 If you drop back 
 I'm a quarterback sack that 
 We can go deep 
 And I can shark attack that 
 Say you don't remember where the keys 
 And your hat at? 
 (Chorus:Repeat x2)
