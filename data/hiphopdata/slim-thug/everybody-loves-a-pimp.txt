 Everybody loves a pimp 
 Chuch, church... Tabernackle, tabernackle... Preach, preach 
 Everybody loves a pimp 
 The way I talk, the way I dress 
 I be so clean, I look so fresh 
 The ice I wear, the car I drive 
 The hoes I got, they look so fly 
 When ya pimpish... ya pimpin' 
 Everybody loves a pimp 
 When ya pimpish... ya pimpin' 
 Everybody loves a pimp 
 You know da Boss got bitches galore 
 And you may have a lotta bitches but he got much more 
 >From BK, NY to the Malibu shore 
 I got a chick in every city, I can go on tour 
 Ya need a pimp in ya life that's gon' guide ya right 
 Wont handcuff ya when ya try'na creep at night 
 I don't lose sleep at night behind that 
 Nah I don't care, I be hibernatin call me Yogi Da Bear 
 I'm a pimp baby, that's why I hold my nuts and walk wit a limp baby 
 I know you tired of dealin' wit all them simps baby 
 So gon' hop on my team and drop ya wimp baby 
 It's that simple baby 
 Slim ain't wit gettin' drama from chicks 
 So when my boo turn bitch that's my cue to switch 
 You wont catch me throwin' licks 'cause my feelins involved 
 I just erase 'em out the black book, problem solved 
 Bitch should learn how to keep her mouf closed 
 I got ZERO toleration for hoes 
 Move to the next one, there's plenty fish in the sea 
 And plus there's plenty other chicks that dig me 
 I'm a pimp baby, that's why I hold my nuts and walk wit a limp baby 
 I know you tired of dealin' wit all them simps baby 
 So gon' hop on my team and drop ya wimp baby 
 It's that simple baby
