Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard 
 When we drink we do it right gettin' slizzard 
 Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 (Slim Thug) 
 Step up in the club, fly as a G6 
 Lookup at my section, I got all the fly chicks 
 Smoking, sippin sizzurp getting high then a bitch 
 Keep the party poppin' all night, don't quit 
 Taking shot of that Patrone, shot's of that jager 
 Charge it to my card, we recycling our paper 
 I'm wasted, you wasted, we wasted 
 Let me take you to my crib and get you butt naked! 
 Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard 
 When we drink we do it right gettin' slizzard 
 Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 (Slim Thug) 
 I'm 30,000 feet up in the air 
 This good weed got me higher then a Lear 
 I'm so wasted, I can't even see clear 
 Just make sure these pretty woman stay there 
 I'm too crunk, 'cause I'm too drunk 
 You know I'm wasted, if you see me hit the fist pump 
 I'm too thrown, 'cause I'm too blown 
 But I stil ain't stoppin', let's gooo 
 Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard 
 When we drink we do it right gettin' slizzard 
 Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 (Dre Day) 
 Pass me that cliko, I got me 3 more 
 Bitches they slizzerd, they giving me a peepshows 
 Me so horny, I can go all night look at me storming 
 Stumbling falling out the door 
 I'm still screaming "I need more" 
 Now, where my ride 
 Eyes tight like stitches 
 Still on my pimpin' 
 Now, where my bitches 
 Ow, there they go 
 It's about to be a freaknik 
 'Cause we drunk and high like a, like a G6 
 Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard 
 When we drink we do it right gettin' slizzard 
 Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6 
 Like a G6, Like a G6 
 Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
