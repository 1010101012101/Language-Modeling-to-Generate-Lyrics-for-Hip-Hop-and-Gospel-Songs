 Home of the 84's & 4's & the purple drank. 
 Bun B: 
 Yeah, it's the city that's slowed, the city that's throwed 
 The city where them boys flip the candy painted lows 
 The city where they blow big killer and stay blowed 
 Hustlin' ass D-boys got the game sold 
 Where they sip that drank and drip that paint 
 And drop that top and grip that grain (hold up)

 This Clutch City where we play what we dealt 
 Welcome my H-Town.

 Where the gangsta's smoke water, we drank stains on the shirt 
 We ride swangin' chop blazed just to break boys off 
 From South Park to the Southwest all the way to that nouf

 From Denport Harvard to West Airport all the way to Channelview

 Hit me on the 832, it's Paul Wall what it do.

 Pull up in the monster just look at him hidin'

 We gon' get it and come back with it until we take our last breath 
 From the city where our stadiums drop the top 
 Z-Ro the Crooked, my ghetto ass is good at any hood, any block they got 
 The white cup is for the codiene and the cigarello is for the kush 
 If you want it we got it 'cause there's not a product that we don't push 
 We used to be the dirty south, now we so dirty we sip lean 
 So homey you must be touchin' it, roll if you don't feel me.
