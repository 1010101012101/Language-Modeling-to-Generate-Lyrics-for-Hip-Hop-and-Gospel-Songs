C'est pas possible cette amour 
 C'est pas croyable 
 Tu me fais transpirer 
 C'est parfait 
 Working so hard, every night and day 
 And now we get the pay back 
 Trying so hard, saving up the paper 
 Now we get to lay back 
 Working so hard, every night and day 
 And now we get the pay back 
 The pay back, the pay back 
 Champagne kisses, hold me in your 
 Lap of lux-ury 
 I only want to fly first-class desires 
 You're my limousine 
 So elegant, the way we ride 
 Our passion, it just multiplies 
 There's platinum lightning in the sky 
 Look I'm livin' like a queen 
 This kind of love is getting expensive 
 We know how to live, ba-by 
 We're luxurious, like E-gyptian cotton 
 We're so rich in love, we're rollin', in cashmere 
 Got it in fifth gear, baby 
 Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly 
 Working so hard, every night and day 
 And now we get the pay back 
 Trying so hard, saving up the paper 
 Now we get to lay back 
 Working so hard, every night and day 
 And now we get the pay back 
 The pay back, the pay back 
 Slim Thuga 
 I made my stacks now I finally get to lay back (to lay back) 
 I worked so hard now I finally get the payback (the payback) 
 And blaze sex, ridin' in back of da Maybach (chyea) (Maybach) 
 If it ain't dro', I say no, we don't play that (play that) 
 I'm in my house like a Boss reclined 
 Bumpin' on da sticky green, sippin' on me some wine (some wine) 
 I made it out the hood and I'm feelin' real good about 
 Ridin' in the Benz tryna pull the wood up out (chyea) 
 This kind of love is getting expensive 
 We know how to live, ba-by 
 We're luxurious, like E-gyptian cotton 
 We're so rich in love, we're rollin', in cashmere 
 Got it in fifth gear, baby 
 Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly 
 Working so hard, every night and day 
 And now we get the pay back 
 Trying so hard, saving up the paper 
 Now we get to lay back 
 Working so hard, every night and day 
 And now we get the pay back 
 The pay back, the pay back 
 Working so hard, every night and day 
 And now we get the pay back 
 Trying so hard, saving up the paper 
 Now we get to lay back 
 Working so hard, every night and day 
 And now we get the pay back 
 The pay back, the pay back 
 Cha-ching, cha-ching 
 We're loaded and we're not gonna blow it 
 Cha-ching, cha-ching 
 We're hooked up with the love 'cause we grow it 
 Cha-ching, cha-ching 
 We got hydroponic love and we're smokin' 
 Cha-ching, cha-ching 
 We burn it, you and I, we are so lit 
 We're so rich in love, we're rollin', in cashmere 
 Got it in fifth gear, baby 
 Diamond in the rough, is lookin' so sparkly 
 Working so hard, every night and day 
 And now we get the pay back 
 Trying so hard, saving up the paper 
 Now we get to lay back 
 Working so hard, every night and day 
 And now we get the pay back 
 The pay back, the pay back 
 This is how we roll 
 So luxurious 
 Baby we are so, ex-pen-sive, oh 
 T'est si jolie 
 C'est pas possible
