(Verse 1: Slim Thug) 
 I do this for the block, I do this for the hood 
 I do this for the streets 'cause the streets keep me good, I do it for the hustlers 
 I do it for the thugs, I do it for the G's 'cause the G's Show Me Love 
 I came in the game 17 real loud, only thing on my mind make my mama proud, started rockin' crowds 
 Gettin' dough from shows and as the fame rolls then came the hoes, then came the clothes, then came the cars 
 Next thing I know I'm a ghetto superstar, so here come the haters travelin' by the packs 
 But never mind them 'cause uh... Bitch I'm Back! 
 (Chorus: Devin The Dude) 
 I pour up a cup, fill the swissa with cud and fire it up so I can gather my thoughts 
 More money more problems they say that's how it is when you live like a boss (like a boss) 
 You see, I've been gone on my grind for some time and the streets thought a nigga fell off (hell nah) 
 But if I decide not to rhyme no more rhymes, I'm a still be well off. 
 Slim Thug: 
 'Cause Bitch I'm Back! 
 (Verse 2: Slim Thug) 
 A born boss got nothin' to lose, still shinin' in the game got nothin' to prove 
 Got rich independent didn't need no deal 
 Had paper 'fore I signed, didn't need no meals 
 Got hustles on the side, I ain't got to rap 
 And if all else fails I still got the trap 
 I don't fuck wit you rappers y'all fake to me 
 I don't fuck wit you niggas y'all snakes to me 
 I don't care 'about fame, fuck bein' a star 
 Let them take all the pictures just give me his car 
 Then give me his house and his watch and chain 
 On the bank account, credit cards jot my name 
 But I guess one come with the other 
 So here I go I'm a writin' rap hustler 
 I'm too blessed to complain 'about that 
 So where I gotta sign, take your pictures. 
 'Cause Bitch I'm Back! 
 (Chorus: Devin The Dude) 
 I pour up a cup, fill the swissa with cud and fire it up so I can gather my thoughts 
 More money more problems they say that's how it is when you live like a boss (like a boss) 
 You see, I've been gone on my grind for some time and the streets thought a nigga fell off (hell nah) 
 But if I decide not to rhyme no more rhymes, I'm a still be well off.

 (Verse 3: Slim Thug) 
 They say the truth will hit so fuck it 
 I'm a go an keep it 100 for the public 
 I dropped "Already Platinum" But it only sold gold 
 And niggas lookin' at me like I sold my soul 
 'Cause I'm rappin' with D & not Mr. Lee 
 But when you on your grind sometimes you can't see 
 Before Mike came and Paul was signed 
 I was at interscope tryin' to find my mind 
 Still Tippin' wasn't toppin' 3 kings just dropped 
 And I'm a underground artist tryin' to get on top 
 So I listened to my label, playin' to break X 
 And learned a whole lot of game from that 
 Just stay true my nigga and do you 
 And fuck what another tryin' to tell you to do 
 Continue to spit facts you can bump in them lac's 
 Oh yeah this a Le track. 
 Bitch I'm Back! 
 (Chorus: Devin the Dude) 
 I pour up a cup, fill the swissa with cud and fire it up so I can gather my thoughts 
 More money more problems they say that's how it is when you live like a boss (like a boss) 
 You see, I've been gone on my grind for some time and the streets thought a nigga fell off (hell nah) 
 But if I decide not to rhyme no more rhymes, I'm a still be well off.
