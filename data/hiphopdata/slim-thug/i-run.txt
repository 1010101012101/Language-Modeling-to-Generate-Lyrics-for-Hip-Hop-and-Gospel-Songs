 I rep for my city, go hard for the hood still posted on that block. What's good? 
 Yelawolf: 
 And I Run the streets all night and day 
 I can't stay away. 
 Slim Thug: 
 They don't make too many niggas like me 
 Bonafide hustlers certified G 
 Still got that work if you got the right fiend. 
 You thinkin' shit fake? Well nigga come see 
 It's bigger than the jewels it's bigger than the cars 
 It's bigger than the fact that we fuckin' rap stars 
 The street niggas know me, these boys got my contacts 
 Knowin' any givin' minute I can come back 
 I put a bitch on I-10 and tell her run that 
 Give her 10 and tell her don't bring nuttin' back 
 I'm still in the hood, I can't leave the streets 
 It's in my blood I'm a thug till I be deceased.

 Slim Thug: 
 It's hot on my block somebody turn the fan on 
 I've been paid I'm just tryin' to turn my man's on 
 And get my breads strong, streets miss me when I'm gone 
 I put on for my city like Jeezy's song 
 Please believe me homes matter of fact check my stats 
 Ain't dropped in 3 years but I'm back. 
 Where the money at? That's the first question 
 You better pack a strap that's the first lesson 
 Hard times got the whole United States stressin' 
 I'm writin' a book, how to survive in a recession 
 Mr. Ogbonna, we so tired of sellin' crack 
 If you lookin' for me ask the streets where I'm at.

 Slim Thug: 
 It's home sweet home where the D boys roam 
 Movin' stone for stone or zone for zone 
 All night gettin' it on till 6:00 in the morn. 
 The shit I'm smokin' on, stronger than cologne 
 You can probably mell the moke to your headphones 
 If you still broke better get your bread long 
 Call me on that burner 'cause them fed's on my phone 
 And I'm a Run the streets till I'm under my headstone.
