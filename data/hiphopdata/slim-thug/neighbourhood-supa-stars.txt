Neighborhood super stars 
 It's them boys with the candy sprayed on them cars 
 (Verse 1 - Slim Thug) 
 Bitch you might not know me, but in my hood I'm famous 
 I fuck the baddest bitches, and hang with all the gangsters 
 My slabs is the meanest, my jewelry is the best 
 You think I get close free, because everyday I'm fresh 
 And everybody know me, from young to the old 
 Everywhere I go, they like "Thugga, boy, you cold" 
 They love to see me hit the club and ball out of control 
 Pop bottle after bottle till I fall out on the floor 
 Surrounded by dro clouds, they be like "No smoking" 
 I laugh at they bitch ass like "Ho, stop joking" 
 Keep some candy on them rims, that's poking 
 And every time I hit the board I leave that ho broken 
 Thug Boss, bitch 
 (Verse 2 - Yo Gotti) 
 I'm a legend in my neighborhood 
 Plus I'm connected and respected off in every hood 
 Chrome on chrome, twenty racks under my Cutlass hood 
 You see my name in that bitch, so get that understood 
 I'm an outer space star, bitch I'm up in Mars 
 And if you want to talk money, I got all type of cars 
 Just know I meant it, if I said it, nobody in my family got credit 
 And if you got a million, I bet it 
 Nigga, pockets on Freddy, broke niggas on syrup talking loud 
 In the club, but them bitches don't hear them 
 My jewelry too loud, my cars from overseas 
 You trying to book a show, that gone cost a couple ki's 
 Because bitch, I'm Yo Gotti 
 (Verse 3 - Nipsey Hussle) 
 Yeah, long money till I flat line 
 We trying to spend some cash, hit me on my bat line 
 I swear rapping about my last grind 
 Got me on a money marathon with no halftime 
 When we hit the club, we walk past lines 
 And you can come inside with us, if your ass fly 
 Getting cash, I cash ride 
 Beating all the competition by landslide 
 Neighborhood super star in my swag high 
 Take a nigga bitch, put him on standby 
 And if a plaintiff ever ask me hold my hand high 
 I'ma take the stand and tell a goddamn lie
