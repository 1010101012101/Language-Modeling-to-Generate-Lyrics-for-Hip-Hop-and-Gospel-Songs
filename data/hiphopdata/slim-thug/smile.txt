I'm So Fly 
 All the haters and the killers tryin' to get me 
 When I walk by 
 All the girls wanna take a picture with me. 
 So baby just Smile for the camera 
 For the camera 
 For the camera 
 So baby just Smile for the camera 
 For the camera 
 For the camera. 
 I got super size swag, I'm honest with the class 
 Fresh up off the bag, somebody pull out my tag 
 I guess that's why these haters always lookin' so mad 
 I guess that's why this girl want her picture so bad 
 By hard means fast while we froze for the pose 
 Before rap, I was most chose by the hoes 
 Before you go she snip me somethin' else on the low 
 A red dotted list to see me with no clothes. 
 I'm So Fly 
 All the haters and the killers tryin' to get me 
 When I walk by 
 All the girls wanna take a picture with me. 
 So baby just Smile for the camera 
 For the camera

 So baby just Smile for the camera 
 For the camera 
 For the camera. 
 Beautiful by the bar. You wanna be a star? 
 Look like a boss in the big house and fancy cars 
 How 'about we make everything that's by ours 
 For example let me let you hold a black card 
 And don't worry 'about your man, he just act hard 
 Before he get to you, you gotta go through that squad. 
 You like swimmin'? I gotta lake in my backyard 
 I'll take you on a date to the B.E.T. Awards. 
 I'm So Fly 
 All the haters and the killers tryin' to get me 
 When I walk by 
 All the girls wanna take a picture with me. 
 So baby just Smile for the camera

 Keep that ice on our chest... 
 And we dress so fly... 
 And we stay smokin' on the best... 
 So you know a player's so high... 
 So baby just Smile for the camera 
 For the camera 
 For the camera 
 So baby just Smile for the camera 
 For the camera 
 For the camera.
