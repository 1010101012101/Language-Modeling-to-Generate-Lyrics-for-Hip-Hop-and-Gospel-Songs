(*Talking*) 
 Slim Thugger, The Bossman, ha 
 I'm bout to start open hands smacking these punks 
 Around mayn, what's wrong with Big Pic 
 Come to the Boss, ha, they must don't know who I am 
 Listen, let me tell you 
 (Slim Thug) 
 Introducing from Houston, Slim Thug the Boss 
 Champion with no loss, known for running his mouth 
 I break 'em off, back back track for track 
 Try to attack, come on I pack the Mack 
 I shut 'em down, turn them clown smiles to frowns 
 The quick to get down, when the Boss come around 
 They don't want it, let me demolish all my opponents 
 They want the Boss crown, but uh Slim Thug own it 
 I'm changing the game, doing this underground thang 
 Ever since I represent this, it ain't been the same 
 First I pull up on swangs, trunk pop and top drop 
 And next year on 20's, lil' later non-stopping 
 On them Sprewells, I hear a lot of cats rap about it 
 But I'm the only rapper in H-Town, that got it 
 I speak the truth, every time I touch the booth 
 And I ain't drop a solo yet, 'cause I ain't hurt the loot, hatas 
 (*Talking*) 
 Getting this money baby, know I'm saying 
 A lot of people against me, 'cause they see a young 
 Playa getting his shine on, getting his grind on 
 Know I'm saying, doing what he wanna do 
 But that go with the territory, you know I'm saying 
 Young Hogg getting money, Boss Hogg Outlaws 
 (Slim Thug) 
 Getting paper, that's why I'm the main subject of these hatas 
 They hate to see me riding Harley's, sitting on Gators 
 And ask y'all jewelry man, who holding the crown 
 Y'all can get a record deal, I still be holding it down 
 Blow dro pounds, nothing but the best for the Boss 
 21 years old, in a six bedroom house 
 Hustle-holic, CEO shots I cal
