(Chorus: Chamillionaire) 
 Big Swangaz and Vouges 
 Them 20 inches sittin' low 
 We Ball 24's 7's all that we know 
 Screens and neon lights gon show 
 When my trunk unlock pop and show 
 Ya already know 
 Paint drippin off the door 
 Not Engaged with no lady, fall in love with 'em no! 
 You may think I'm crazy never knew this type of love before 
 I'm love with my foreign, yes I'm married to my dough... 
 I'm in love with my money... mmmm 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 You can catch me squeezing grain 
 Sittin' crooked on D's and swangz 
 Color changin lizard he's insane 
 Ya womans missing then he's to blame 
 Charge it to the game keep the change 
 Most marriages blyossom and die... 
 When it's over I'm tellin' her bye 
 But she acts like I'm tellin' a lie 
 While you fallin' in love with a she... 
 I rather be dubblin a G 
 Could you see me in a car that rhymes with rent me and starts with a be 
 Could you see a Bentley 
 Parked in the crunkest spot in ya hood 
 Candy coat on top of the hood 
 And my fist on top of the wood 
 Sparkling good 
 Say you ain't after my change I don't believe ya 
 If a skeezer ask me to feed her 
 With my visa then I'm gon leave her 
 Koopa don't want ya koopa don't need ya 
 { But I Love You } that's sweet 
 I rather be ridin' on glass feet 
 With leather up under my ass cheeks 
 It's not like I changed over night 
 Been actin' like this since last week 
 Better Ask P my money stretched like an athelete at a track meet 
 Seen him last week in a Jag Jeep 
 { But they don't even make them yet 'causezin } 
 Ok I'm lyin' I don't know what it was 
 But I swear that boi was sittin' on buttons 
 I know you want a relationship with a balla but no thanx Look 
 I'd rather be shining my twanks 
 You must think this is a bank but it ain't 
 Money increase and never would shink 
 Hoes that be dikin even be fightin... 
 When I pull up on 20 inch titans 
 'Cause I got what them girls be likin 
 Them uh... 
 (Paul Wall) 
 Hold on hold up a second man 
 I never mack to a metro dame 
 You better respect the game 
 See my gecko chain and correct ya brain 
 I love my car like it was my girlfriend I like to carress the grain 
 Followed the wheel and I got aroused 
 Swung in the ditch and I wrecked the frame 
 Broke up with my foreign car and fell in love with my cadillac 
 The Ringling Brothers enquired to how my trunk turns flips like an acrobat 
 I act a rat, 'cause I'm from the gutter 
 Ya girl stutter when I pull up next to ya 
 You been with the girl 6 months Paul Wall 
 Is the reason she won't give sex to ya 
 Why all that plex in ya 
 'Cause a German company made my rims 
 My big body's pregant with twins I'm bout to induce a baby benz 
 Ya car was fly in the hood but my candy paint just wet ya flames 
 I'm sittin' on 22 inch baby sitters babelous threatin ya name 
 Forgot to change the diaper so when I crept in the lane I left a stain 
 Everytime it rains, paint drips It makes a mess and I get the blame 
 My TV's are the pet I train I can make 'em roll over and play dead 
 My car was blue on the freeway 
 But when I stopped at the light it changed to red 
 You betta re arrange ya head thinkin' I trick my cash to a broad... 
 Go ahead and ask ya broad I got more green than the grass in a yard 
 And that's so raw It ain't hard for me to get the class to applaud 
 I shine like a blasting star, glass on a car more blacker than tar
