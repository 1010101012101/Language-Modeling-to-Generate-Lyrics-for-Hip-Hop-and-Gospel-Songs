(Hook: Mannie Fresh] [x2) 
 In the streets 
 In the club 
 All the real muthafuckers Show Me Love 
 Now I open up this bitch & I'm a show you how to show off 
 Clean in this bitch with the price tag towoff. 
 (Verse 1: Slim Thug) 
 Don't call it a comeback 
 'Cause I been here for years 
 Wreckin' my peers, through the blood, sweat and tears 
 Here it is, Thugga back at it like a addict 
 No matter the price, give it here I gotta have it 
 When I step up out my house, everyday I gotta show off 
 Clean than a bitch with the price tag towoff 
 Everything new, straight up out the mall 
 From my pants, to my shirt, to my shoes, to my draws 
 I show you how to ball, take notes and keep lookin' 
 Stay tuned to the show and see what Thugga got cookin' 
 Money back guaranteed, everyday I'm a go off 
 I'm rich than a bitch, shit I might as well show off.

 Thugga fresh like a Mannie be 
 Dillerman, hand me keys 
 Pull up off the lot, drop coupe, 300 G 
 Man it's so fun to be me, I'm the wannabe 
 On your TV, yeah G, I'm the one you see 
 The rose was the blessin' so I pull that out the Sunday 
 The Benz the work card, so I pull that on Monday 
 The coupe good on gas so I dry that all week 
 And I pull out my Slab, when I shut down the streets 
 I'm a beast, hit the jury man with my peeps 
 Big hundred carrot badge, I'm the captain of the streets 
 Roll deep like police, blue boys got it lock 
 You see me on patrol in your hood on yo' block 
 Holla.

 When I hit the club all the girls Show Me Love 
 'Cause worldwide they be fuckin' with Thug 
 Because the boss got class, the boss stay G'd 
 I'm everywhere you ain't never there. Where you be? 
 I got a crib in Miami, house side in Cali 
 A Spot in ATL, but I be out there Bally 
 'Cause I live in the H & got hoes 'around the globe 
 Stacking up you want, I'm gettin' dough by the low 
 That's how I stay froze and fresh with the clothes 
 My closet got mo' kicks than they got in the store's 
 I pop tags, shirt match my badge 
 Eyelids low, lookin' at the Prada glass.
