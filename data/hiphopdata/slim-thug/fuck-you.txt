(Slim Thug) 
 As is, I ain't changing for you suckers 
 If you ain't f-cking with me, f-ck ya 
 And if you ain't feeling how I feel, f-ck ya 
 You bitches ain't paying my bills, so f-ck ya 
 I'mma boss, how bout low, ride out for the clique 
 Or you can ride with us or eat a sick d-ck 
 I tell it how it is, them n-ggas speak fiction 
 I gotta keep it real, that sh-t is an addiction 
 So open up ya ears, all ya gotta do is listen 
 Then every time you see me, I'mma pull the description 
 If I say I got a Bentley than that bitch outside 
 If I say the watch 50, ask my Jeweler if I lie 
 Thug boss bitch 
 I don't give a f-ck, if I do it's f-ck you 
 If you don't like what a n-gga do, f-ck you 
 That sh-t you n-ggas talking ain't true, f-ck you 
 We got our money right n-gga, what you wanna do 
 I don't give a f-ck, if I do it's f-ck you 
 If you don't like what a n-gga do, f-ck you 
 That sh-t you n-ggas talking ain't true, f-ck you 
 We got our money right n-gga, what you wanna do 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 I don't give a f-ck, if I do, it's f-ck you 
 Run and do these holes like Maurice Jones Drew 
 Life on the edge, I want my jumpsuit 
 My hoes keep their mouth closed like they suck glue 
 Weezy in this b-tch, Thugga I got ya 
 I'm all up in they face like the f-cking eye doctor 
 F-ck with me wrong turn ya brains into pasta 
 Double barrell punk, it look like nostrils 
 Real n-gga status, real n-gga period 
 You a real n-gga, now that's a conspiracy 
 Young money sh-t, you gon need some artillery 
 Science class n-gga, me and money got chemistry 
 I don't give a f-ck, if I do it's f-ck you 
 If you don't like what a n-gga do, f-ck you 
 That sh-t you n-ggas talking ain't true, f-ck you 
 We got our money right n-gga, what you wanna do 
 I don't give a f-ck, if I do it's f-ck you 
 If you don't like what a n-gga do, f-ck you 
 That sh-t you n-ggas talking ain't true, f-ck you 
 We got our money right n-gga, what you wanna do 
 (Slim Thug) 
 Ain't no punchlines in my rhymes I'm like this and like that 
 Its just 36 lines of straight facts 
 Okay I take that back, 36 lines of crack 
 Now that's a brick hard n-gga can you buy that 
 Try that 
 Is that sh-t that you rap about real? 
 Okay tell me this, how many n-ggas you done killed? 
 Okay, tell me this, is your clique really trill 
 Or you just get gassed on, these pay the bills 
 The n-ggas tell the truth what would they be saying 
 Be caught up in the streets and be like I was just playing 
 That's why they get robbed or set up for the slam 
 I'ma be me even when I'm verse laying
