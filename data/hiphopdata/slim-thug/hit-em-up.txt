(*Talking*) 
 Who the fuck these niggaz talking to man 
 These niggaz talking down on me mayn 
 Man, let me wreck this lil' midget ass nigga 
 Don't one of them hoe ass niggaz got a skin disease 
 Or something mayn, man I'm fin to tear they 
 Whole motherfucking label up 
 This the Boss Slim Thugger baby, hit 'em up 
 Fuck 'em ha, shouldn't of fucked with me boy 
 (Slim Thug) 
 First I'll fuck Lil Yo, and the label you claim 
 You bitch made gay nigga, I gave you the game 
 You only got some street fame, cause you was rolling with me 
 Trying to follow the footsteps, of Slim T-H-U-G 
 And all along, I use to think I did something wrong 
 But fuck that, some niggaz just belong in thoughts 
 Talking 'bout a nigga left you, bitch you ain't my girlfriend 
 If I didn't, I'd be in the same position you in 
 He say he moved up out the hood, is that what he think 
 He moved a half a mile up the street, on Gulfbank 
 You still staying with your mama, how you call yourself a rapper 
 If you acting like you broke, you's a hell of a actor 
 Who the fuck you think you are, bitch I'm the Northstar 
 Your whole record label, can't fuck with me by far 
 Motherfuck a Black Mario, that's your G 
 You 26 selling dope, but can't move OZ 
 J Dogg you ain't a Hogg, so I stripped off your title 
 Waterhead ass nigga, is Pookie your idol 
 You on some dope fiend shit, stop begging me for money 
 Go get a ride Lil Yo, and tell him give you something dummy 
 You fell off, whole label getting wrecked by the Boss 
 Northstar and Stomp Down, just took another loss 
 Before I quit, I can't forget about that other bitch 
 Fuck A.D., and that bootlegging bitch Pic 
 That's some bullshit talking, super weak ass niggaz 
 Telling lies, every time you try to speak t
