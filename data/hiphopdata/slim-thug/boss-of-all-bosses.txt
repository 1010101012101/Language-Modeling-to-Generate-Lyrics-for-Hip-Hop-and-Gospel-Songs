It's Slim Thugga Muthafucker, got alot to sell 
 But snitches already got alot to tell 
 So for as y'all know all I do is just rap 
 And give these streets somethin' they can play in they trap, yeah 
 Last year I had to put my city back on the map 
 This year we gon' hit 'em right back with a slap, that's right 
 I had the whole wide world tippin' on 4's 
 Sippin' on drank, usin' gland slow 
 Claimin' they the boss I guess they like my style 
 Copy what I do, mayne they like my child 
 I'm listenin' like damn mayne them boys wild 
 Thinkin' to myself, mayne them boys loud 
 Writin' everything from my slang to my smile 
 Damn! 
 Thought I was gon' let it slide... Hell Naw! 
 If the shoe fit very, listen tot he comparey 
 You niggas ain't my fam, how I style you in hared. 
 I call all shots, all wins no losses 
 Follow me I'm The Boss Of All Bosses 
 I'm The Boss Of All Bosses [x4] 
 Fuck what cha heard, and fuck what they talkin' 
 They follow me I'm The Boss Of All Bosses 
 I'm The Boss Of All Bosses. [x4] 
 H-Town, let it settle I'm a lead the way 
 The only rapper doing everything I say 
 The other boys fishin' go up their and Christians 
 I'm a good dude I just gotta alot addiction, that's right 
 I love gettin' money you can see it in my face 
 It's like I'm bout to bust when I step my safe, yeah 
 I love gettin' pussy but I hate these hoes [echoes] 
 I'm 'bout to hit the block and -drop the top on 4's- 
 I know you probably tired of hearin' about my cars 
 That's what cha get for turnin' good niggas to stars 
 What the fuck you'll do, you'll see 
 Never had shit now you rich as you can be 
 Used to hit Lick's sellin' bricks in the streets 
 Now I'm sellin' hits for 10 times the fee 
 And stand free, I ain't never seein' no jails 
 The boss of the south goin' stay giving them hell. 
 I call all shots, all wins no losses 
 Follow me I'm The Boss Of All Bosses 
 I'm The Boss Of All Bosses [x4] 
 Fuck what cha heard, and fuck what they talkin' 
 They follow me I'm The Boss Of All Bosses 
 I'm The Boss Of All Bosses. [x4]
