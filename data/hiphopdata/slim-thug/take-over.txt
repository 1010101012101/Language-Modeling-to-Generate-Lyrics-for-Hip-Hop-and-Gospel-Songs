 The take over, this the hater makeover 
 If you got plex with Slim, I suggest you stay sober 
 No time for slip up's, no room for mistakes 
 I go to war with you cakes, talking bout I'm fake 
 Y'all the ones telling lies, bitch apologize 
 We was all cool, until I started to rise 
 That's when the hate came in your eyes, I remember it clear 
 Back in 9-9, yep I think that was the year 
 I pulled up to the studio, in a drop on swangs 
 Instead of looking happy, y'all looked like y'all was in pain 
 Ever since then, thangs ain't never been the same 
 You haters fell off, and I guess I'm to blame 
 What a shame, back then I could tell you niggas was hoes 
 Y'all use to get paid, fifty dollars a show 
 While I was getting the G's, I told you get your money too 
 The reply was Watts, don't need us like he need you 
 Which was true, cause soon as I left y'all went left 
 Tried to do y'all own thing, and follow my footsteps 
 Only problem is, y'all needed me to make it 
 I know it's hard to take it, but it's the truth face it

 When people come up to me, they ask
