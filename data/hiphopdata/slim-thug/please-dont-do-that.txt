 They say money bring you problems so I got a ton. 
 And success bring you envy so I got a gun. 
 I ain't never ran fast 'cause I ain't never gotta run. 
 If I had to put in work, that shit I got it done. 
 I say to myself, "Never look for trouble G, but keep the glock 
 Cocked jus in case it find me." 
 A lotta haters wanna see me in the casket 'cause I stay fresh like I'm 
 Wrapped in plastic. 
 That's why I got that nine on my waistline.

 Dependin on Slim.
