Li-li-listen 
 I've been a Boss down South, I'm just new to a few 
 I'm the Young Texas A-Rod, KG of the game 
 LeBron James, you niggaz must not know my name 
 I'm Slim Thugger motherfucker! The Big Boss of the South 
 And I don't just talk it wit my mouth 
 (One more time!) 
 (I told you so!) 
 I've been a Boss down South, I'm just new to a few 
 I'm the Young Texas A-Rod, KG of the game 
 LeBron James, you niggaz must not know my name 
 I'm Slim Thugger motherfucker! Tha Big Boss of the South 
 And I don't just talk it wit my mouth 
 I back it up wit my vow 
 Before Jimmy cut the check, it was 50 on my neck 
 And over 50 in my ear, I'm the Rookie of the Year 
 I'm here - for the 'Takeover', not out to replace Hova 
 But there's a new hustla in town, yeah the break's over 
 Don't get me confused wit the rest of them dudes 
 I've been Tha Boss down South, I'm just new to a few 
 Please believe, them niggaz don't do what I do 
 I got everything them other rappers got times two 
 Paid the cost to the be the boss 
 Paid the cost to the be the boss 
 I Paid the cost to the be the boss 
 I've been a Boss down South, I'm just new to a few 
 My niggaz get up on it, live bitches throw it back (Look at me!) 
 Ma, act like you want it 
 I know you heard of that! 
 I'm that new problem outta Houston, you got word of that? 
 It's Slim Thug and Neptunes, I know you heard of that 
 Ask your girl, she'll tell ya the truth 
 Your boys cool, but you can't fool wit the Boyz-N-Blue 
 I got something on my neck worth more than yo house 
 I got something in my yard worth more than yo spouse (Get Down!) 
 I got something on my wrist worth more than ya team 
 And that car you think clean ain't worth more than my ring (hold up!) 
 Who yo know roll Bentley 'fore the album drop? 
 And still got a few from Pharrell to make the album hot 
 Yeah I hear y'all but don't see you niggaz 
 Y'all just making words rhyme, y'all ain't seeing these figgas! 
 Paid the cost to the be the boss 
 Paid the cost to the be the boss 
 I Paid the cost to the be the boss 
 I've been Tha Boss down South, I'm just new to a few (Look at me!) 
 My niggaz get up on it, live bitches throw it back 
 Ma, act like you want it 
 I know you heard of that!
