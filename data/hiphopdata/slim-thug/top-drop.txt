 Slim Thugga, Muthafucker! 
 (Verse 1: Slim Thug) 
 For you jackers that's hatin' 
 Run up try to rob yeah bitch I'm a be waitin' 
 In the country see me skatin' 
 On my chrome lookin' good 
 You fuck with my bitch & I'm a shoot up your hood 
 Still leather and the wood that's tradition down in Texas 
 Roll Cadillac we don't fuck with no Lexus 
 Bitch by my side in my ride lookin' lovely 
 Pour up out the paint we ain't sippin' on no bubbly 
 Screwed tape loud while I'm swangin' by the crowd 
 And the dro got me how it feel like I'm in a cloud 
 I'm a H-Town nigga. 
 Reppin' for P.A.T. 
 Big Hawk, D.J. Screw, Big Moe and Pimp C 
 I'm a Shine for my city fuck them haters talkin' down 
 So holla at a nigga when you see me walkin' round 
 07 was a hard one but I can be found 
 In my slab puffin' pounds tryin' to take away my frown 
 And I...

 (Verse 2: Paul Wall) 
 I got my mind on my money and my glock in my hand 
 Grindin' hard, paper stackin' tryin' to follow the plan 
 Pullin' gloss and steams chasin' million dollar dreams 
 Livin' the thug life I get it by any means 
 When times get hard I got no one to hold me down 
 So I ride with the top down and cruise around town 
 The boppers in line; 'cause I been known to be a slab rider 
 Comin' down clean, marchin' like a freedom fighter 
 When you ridin' 4's partner stay strapped 
 The gone catch you at the light and put one in your cap 
 See I keep it in my lap; I ain't slippin' for none 
 I ain't got sprayed by any but homey I ain't done 
 I'm 'about to raise a truck and drop a couple of screens 
 I'm thinkin' rides with fine scapes with 'about 415's 
 See the leather is perforated; them boys gon' sure hate it 
 My slab is undisputed I'm the #1 rated 
 With my Top Drop. 
 Got the damn Top

 (Verse 3: Slim Thug) 
 While they waitin' on me to fall; I'm a still stand tall 
 Ball hard in the mall 
 I been shinin' for a while; haters you in denial 
 Since back in 9 -8 I been wreckin' freestyles 
 With spit lines that'll put a smile on your child 
 And do a song that'll make the hood go wild 
 The flow versatile; When they hear it they like wow 
 That boy got talent yeah I like your style. 
 But uh... 
 No pressure; don't let the bullshit stress ya 
 A 4 with somebody test ya 
 God bless ya 
 Ya Grind lesser; ya shine lesser 
 Ya win when you don't let this material shit impress ya 
 Insides like a dresser; woodgrain on the dash 
 My motto; Fuck pain put my name on the cash 
 I used to wish and dream I could swang on the glass 
 Now cars clothes and hoes is a thing of the past 
 And I... 
 Got the damn Top 
 Got the damn Top Drop 
 Got the Got the damn Top Drop, Top Drop, Top Drop
