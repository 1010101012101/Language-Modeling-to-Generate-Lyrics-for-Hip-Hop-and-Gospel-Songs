My bitch been down when I wasn't shit 
 She keep it 100 don't switch 
 Cause that's my bitch

 Even help hit a couple licks 
 So she still my bitch 
 Gotta help a nigga get rich 
 Get pop she ain't never gone snitch

 Go hard she ain't never gone quit naw 
 She as real as a bitch get 
 Cause that's my bitch. 
 I got a down bitch I can ride around wit 
 From the hood I can smoke me a pound wit 
 Keep it G she ain't wit all that bullshit 
 But got her own money far from a groupie bitch 
 She a dime all around players want to save her 
 They tell her thugga ain't gon' love you. 
 Fuckin' haters!

 She say her pussy ain't for sell you can keep the change 
 As far as I can tell it's a keeper man 
 Ain't tryin' to argue wit you baby let you do you 
 Got me trippin' like it's too good to be true.

 I'm gettin' lovesick I think I got a fever 
 Never thought I'd see the day when I fall in love 
 Got plenty bats but she the only one I'm thinkin' of
