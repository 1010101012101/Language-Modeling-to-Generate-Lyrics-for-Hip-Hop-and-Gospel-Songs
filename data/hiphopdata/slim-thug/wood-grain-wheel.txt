Now I gots ta work my wood grain wheel 
 Trunks steady bumpin grillz steady comin' 
 I takin' off down the runway broad day Sunday haters lookin' at me I ain't playin' nutin but gunplay 
 Hand on the grain while I'm swangin on the oneway boppas everywhere I see it'll be a fun day

 Got baby momma drama cause the bitch drivin' a hyndai and I got a rolls g up hoes still down till I'm down watch me act a damn clown 
 Haterz sit around makin' muthafuckas frown flippin through my town tryin' to see what the fucks up boss city ballas

 Candy paint shinin 5th wheel reclinin caddy goin' topless like them dancers at the diamond 
 Boss yeah blindin and everybody lookin' and where I'm from women ain't the only ones cookin 
 Boyz gettin' paid pushin caddy escalade still roll vogs used to roll blades 
 Braids in tha face when we rep tha north side

 Smashin the gas find them boyz on glass

 Ridin' down mlk chuckin dueces to that trae (where you at trae) 
 Niggas on the grind mayne boyz is on the j

 While I'm workin on the grain ima hog on the road

 Everyday I stay stuntin ain't goin' to stop till I'm dead on the north side we ride blue not the red 
 Now I gots ta work my wood grain wheel 
 Trunks steady bumpin grillz steady comin'
