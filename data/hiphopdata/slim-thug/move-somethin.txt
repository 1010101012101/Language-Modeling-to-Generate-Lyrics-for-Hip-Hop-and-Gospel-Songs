(Talking) 
 It's finally here motherfuckers (fuckers) Slim Thugger (Slim Thugger) 
 Long awaited (long awaited), anticipated (anticipated) Already Platinum (Already Platinum) 
 I'd like to thank everybody who been down with me from day one 
 From my represent this to the boss, to having thangs, preciate ya, Stay down 
 (1st Verse) 
 I'm back for the first time, like Luda 
 Pull out ya radios and computers, the big boss about to say something to ya 
 And I ain't speaking to move or groove ya, I'm here to teach-n-tell 
 And take advantage of this time to introduce myself 
 I'm Slim Thug, across the states, I know that name rings bell 
 A young Texas, independent, given these majors hell 
 'Cause I ain't signing for crumbs, and given up my income 
 To get treated like a bum, niggas must think I'm dumb (huh) 
 I'm rich and shameless, I ain't gotta be famous 
 Just pay me cash out the anus, I won't do no complaining 
 And my budget probably won't cut me million dollar videos but 
 Fuck the props, we got our own drops and jewelry to show 
 I got plenty of fine ho's and top of the line clothes 
 With behinds that blow the minds of the niggas behind doors 
 I still perform at sold out shows, and rock the crowds 
 And can be heard on radios on every block loud 
 You can't believe everything you see on TV, especially the cats you see on BET 
 That's why this DVD is attached to this CD, everything you see 
 You gone see, when you see me (yeah) 
 I'm not a fraud mayne (nope) I swear to GOD mayne (yeah) 
 I grind hard mayne (yeah), to shine hard mayne (yeah) 
 You see the broads I bang (you see'em), you see the cars I swang (you see'em) 
 The stars on chain (you see'em), nigga I'm having thangs 
 They think I'm slinging cane, when they see me switchin lanes 
 24's glistening, rocks on top of wrists and rings, everyday 
 Different piece in chains, that's why "The Boss", my name 
 This ain't a game, y'all can't even ball like my dame, mayne 
 (Talking) 
 You gotta excuse me for being a little arrogant right now, uknowhatimsayin 
 I'm a little heated at how these white folks try to treat a nigga 
 They already know, we got three ways up out the hood 
 Either you play sports, you rap, or you sell drugs, uknowhatimsayin 
 A nigga tryin' to do it the right way, with this motherfucking mic and thangs 
 And they wanna offer a nigga, a dollar off each motherfucking CD 
 And expect a nigga to eat, and take that 
 While them hoe's try to chump a nigga, $50,000, $100,000 up front 
 Nigga I'm sitting on that already 
 (2nd Verse) 
 Slim ain't waiting six months for a check in the mail 
 I'ma make my staff check retail, and pick-up my checks myself 
 I'm a boss, and proud of my position, check out how the young man hand glisten 
 I'm "Already Platinum" listen 
 Majors, I gotta be reading these papers wrong, 'cause what they say y'all paying 
 I been sitting on 
 I bust my ass to spit hits, and you gone tell me I can't get at least half, of my cash (huh) 
 Don't make me laugh 
 You won't get my autograph on ya dotted lines (nope) 
 I master underground grind, I ain't gotta sign to shine 
 So you can find me in the "Unsigned Hype", but don't look down on me homey 
 I got my money right, the rap industry remind me of "pimps and ho's" 
 And Slim ain't selling hisself, to bring nobody no dough (preach) 
 We all bosses, so please be cautious, when you approach us promoting losses 
 Tryin' throw us in crosses, come with the Master P love, when you approach Slim Thug 
 I ain't tryin' to be on "106 and Park" and still sell drugs 
 It's a damn shame how niggas in the game getting fucked 
 You went platinum and all you got to show is a Cadillac truck 
 So major labels get ya weight up, I ain't taking no pay cut 
 Just to be seen on the screen when I'm a Underground King 
 And I don't mean to be conceited, I just got shit on my chest 
 But you can't expect the best, to just settle for less (huh) 
 (Talking) 
 Yeah, I feel much better now I got that shit up off my chest 
 That was fyi... For all y'all those that don't know Slim Thugger, uknowhatimsayin 
 And don't understand why I ain't signed or you don't see me on BET 
 That's what up, uknowhatimsayin, I'm getting this underground down here in Texas 
 Mayne, I sell 100,000 to get my meal ticket if I got to, you feel me 
 I refuse to let these motherfuckers rape me (rape me) 
 I'm getting money, how I doing it right now, baby, I'm good (I'm good) 
 I know you see me in the streets, I know ya see me, I know ya see me 
 Slim Thugger, Already Platinum
