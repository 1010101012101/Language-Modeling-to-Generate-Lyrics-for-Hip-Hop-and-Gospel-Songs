First case, a mothafuckin cop wants to see if he can get away with beating up a nigga with a Glock 
 But now I am the judge and the jury, a punk devil trying to tell his long ass story 
 The statistics are different, now you'll be a casualty 
 Your luck just ran out, no more police brutality 
 Any crime committed against a black means death 
 The tables are turned and slavery is in effect 
 But this time it's for the white man and his family 
 Now it's my turn to pay him back for the damage he did to my people 
 Now there ain't no equal justice 
 And when I think about a devil's life 
 Well fuck it 
 So I ain't even jiggle there's no way you could be saved 
 And no more shit will I take from a caveman 
 One night further then the next night's move came up 
 Cause you can't undo it's locked tight 
 But now look at you 
 You want me to free you 
 Learn the fucking alphabet A B C you 
 So long white boy you lost the right 
 I sentence you to the electric chair 
 Next case 
 Second case 
 A little girl's killed by a Korean ass bitch 
 Over an orange juice that wasn't even spilled on the counter 
 But yes, she got smoked 
 The hoe is in my court room with her family 
 Huh, what a joke 
 She's crying like a bitch 
 Well, she don't know that don't sway me 
 She think she can get away with this, the bitch is crazy 
 An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth 
 Straight for the chair, her last drink will be an orange juice 
 That just goes to show you that we're black don't mean we're stupid 
 All the stuff I'm talking bout is all the shit that you did 
 For some odd reason we can't come into your stores 
 And buy an orange juice cause you think all blacks are poors 
 But your ass wouldn't be rich if not for blacks 
 Just so we tell, ramen hoe, straighten out your facts 
 I have no remorse, no sympathy for no Korean taking the life of a black human being 
 A teenager, age 15, that's even worse 
 Here's a little notice, bitch, gone her in the hearse 
 Step into my courtroom and I'll pinch you in your face 
 Death to anyone who's killed a black 
 Next case 
 Bailiff, please bring me in the last one 
 A nigga beat and killed a man with a sawed off shotgun 
 Tell me what was the reason, he whistled at my wife 
 He was only 18 but the fact that he was white 
 So me and my buddies got a lynch mob together 
 We got bats, chains, whips or whatever 
 We knew we didn't need then we whooped his honky ass 
 To teach him not to whistle at my queen when he walks past 
 But it got out of hand when the redneck tried to run 
 So I guess that means you gonna sentence me to murder one 
 What you did ain't really nothing so unnecessarily 
 'Cause we never said you could make out our identity 
 Since they are fallen they're going through what we all went through 
 Choose between death or probation, one of the two 
 Blacks have taken all abuse in court, now it's their turn 
 You get five years probation 
 Court is adjourned
