Aye hereby I sentence you black mothafuckas to 25 years to life in the state pen for three counts of murder one 
 Oh no no no 
 Tweedy Bird Loc is on a mission that's to kill 
 Niggers on a dick get off your knees and write your will 
 Make sure you leave everything to me 
 If not I'm taking it 
 Thought you was the real I knew all along you been faking it 
 Your path turned fatal when you got into my cage 
 The Tweedy Bird was waiting on my lap was the 12 gauge 
 Next time you'll think twice 
 I ain't nothing nice 
 When I'm paying dues, punk, you'll be paying the price 
 You fiddle's gonna cost your ass a gripping when I give you 
 Not a damn thing and throw your ass in the river 
 Pre mothafucka meditated, yeah I planned it from the house you lived in 
 And the area I scanned it, mafia style 
 I caught you slipping, told your ass to come with me 
 But then you started tripping 
 Pistol whip you in the head 
 Beware cause my Glock is loaded 
 I control it in a minute I'm a cock it 
 The bullet in the chamber and its homies wanna meet you 
 Sixteen shots down, what a way to greet you 
 After all that, still complains I ain't heard of none 
 To me what to misdemeanor, would have been to you murder on 
 Murder one on a sucker 
 Murder one on a punk mothafucka 
 Out goes the street light, pop pop pop 
 Three shots from my nine that I know as the Glock 
 A hood, not a mask covers up my identity 
 A snitching ass fool will soon be my enemy 
 And next on the list of a bitch get fucked up 
 Talking all this bullshit fool quick punked up 
 And get your head blown into pieces 
 This is just the one and ain't no mothafucka hard enough to seize this 
 I'm down with the Tweedy Bird 
 Clear and plain I place the gat over your hair 
 I put a shell in your fucking brain 
 So here we go and now you know ain't no denying 
 Stepping up to the Glock you better stop or you'll be dying 
 My mission is a little bit different from other poopers 
 My goal is to exterminate the fucking KluKluksKlan 
 Oh yeah I got a plan in effect 
 With knowledge I got nine lives never fearing death 
 So now you know that Nini X is real and on a level 
 What brings me my score is killing blue eyed devils 
 Fuck the white man and his Klan 
 And if I was dumb I'd be in his court room 
 Nini X charged with murder one 
 Murder one on a sucker 
 Murder one on a punk mothafucka 
 Murder one with a gun 
 His last wish was a fucking glass of water 
 So give him some 
 It won't do him no damn good for his soul 
 It's finna come right back out but through the bullet hole 
 He tried to escape 
 When I caught him I said I got you 
 Point blank range aimed at his adams apple 
 I shoot in the back or the side of the head 
 In front of his face he'll see me then he'll be dead 
 Then again I might start from the bottom 
 Shoot my way up to the top 
 Damn you got problems 
 I save sixteen of them 
 It depends if your knees get dirty and you say can we be friends 
 In other words, suck a fat dick and beg for mercy 
 All I want to hear punk is Tweedy don't hurt me 
 Then I think about it after that I'm gonna smoke you 
 I might have told you that I let you go 
 It was a joke too 
 Cause Nini X don't fuck up 
 You get stuck up like a poster 
 Straight elimination by the Tweedy Bird Locster 
 Murder in the first degree just you fuck with me and you're done 
 Tweedy Bird, Compton's most wanted for murder one 
 Murder one on a sucker 
 Murder one on a punk mothafucka 
 Tweedy Bird and Nini X 1992 
 Funky press for you, sucka
