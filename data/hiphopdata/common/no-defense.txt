Armed with a arrow you're pointing it straight at my heart, 
 Watching me break as I try to find my way out of the dark, 
 They say each moment comes to an end 
 So my pain is its consequence, 
 It's a battle and I have no defence. 
 Sure as you said that you loved me you turned me away, 
 Suddenly everything changed right in front of my face, 
 They say sometimes loves just unfair 
 But why's it always at my expense? 
 I've no answers and I have no defence. 
 I guess I'll never understand 
 How love can come and go, 
 Looking through the broken glass now I know, 
 But even though my bitter doubt lets my lonliness show, 
 I'll get over you, over you in the end. 
 I wish that I had the courage to leave you behind, 
 Cause you are the one that I'll love for the rest of my life, 
 They say someday I'll trust again 
 But it makes no difference, 
 'Cause it's a battle and I have no defence. 
 No, no, no 
 It's a battle and I have no 
 No defence
