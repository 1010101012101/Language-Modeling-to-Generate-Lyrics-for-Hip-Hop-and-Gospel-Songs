Intro (Sample):Baby, you understand me now (applause) 
 Sometimes you see that I'm mad 
 No one can always be an angel 
 When everything goes wrong you see something bad 
 I'm just a soul who's intention's are good 
 O' lord, please don't let me be misunderstood 
 (Common): Yeah... uh... 
 We do this... for the people that walk that path 
 Try'na get to they dream... yeah... uh... 
 Verse 1: He stood on the corner with the rest of them 
 Though he knew that this corner wasn't the best of them 
 Hard streets and the life that carrested him 
 Dirt police domestic beefs that's festerin' 
 He Knew that the president wasn't addressin' him 
 Though dead presidents was addressin' him 
 Two kids from hot sex no protection and 
 People don't see how aids is affectin' him 
 He get hard you get to get to god questionin' 
 Can't find a job so ya robbin' and hustlin' 
 He killed Marx and sold dope for cousin em' 
 Can't believe that they would be the ones buckin' him 
 He on the ground he could feel god touchin' him 
 He heard the sound of his mom sayin' trust in him 
 And heaven's gates sayin' lord please let me in 
 Or send me back to tell my people to be better man 
 Chorus: Misunderstood ('Cause we are) 
 Don't let me be misunderstood, don't 
 Misunderstood, don't 
 Don't let me be misunderstood, don't (uh... yeah) 
 I'm just human, o 
 Verse 2: She dance and she dance she dance for them 
 Her body move but her mind was manickin' 
 Thinkin' I don't know where they hands had been 
 Relationships with men have been so damagin' 
 She thought back to when she was in howard and 
 Dreams of doing scenes with Terence Howard and 
 Broadway plays and dancin' with Alv and them 
 The ones that make it always ain't the talented 
 Some dreams get lost never to be found again 
 At first strippin' seemed so empowerin' 
 Most every girl wanna do it now and then 
 But bein' meat everyday is devourin' 
 Cats put paper where she put powder in 
 Life would break up now she powderin' 
 She was high when she fell down and then 
 Crowd surroundin' and heart was poundin' and 
 She fell into a deep sleep, the siren sounded and 
 Seein bright lights in the mist of clouds and then 
 Talk to god feelin' like his child again 
 Said lord let me live so I can make you proud again 
 Chorus: Misunderstood ('Cause we are) 
 Don't let me be misunderstood, don't 
 Misunderstood, don't 
 Don't let me be misunderstood, don't 
 I'm just human 
 Break: The life we lead, will always lead us 
 And we pray that he will never leave us 
 It's the price we pay, I guess that's the reason 
 Why my grandma say, we all need Jesus (X2) 
 Chorus: Misunderstood, don't 
 Don't let me be misunderstood, don't 
 Misunderstood, don't 
 Don't let me be misunderstood, don't 
 I'm just human
