(D'angelo) 
 I wanna get closer to you baby 
 Ooh... 
 You have come so far, you've got so far to go 
 You have come so far, you've got so far to go... 
 (Common) 
 Sweetheart, you know that you the most 
 Important, at least on the west coast, ha 
 I'm just trippin', there's something 'bout you though 
 You think different and understand how I flow 
 Got cribs on both coasts 
 But I'm a chicago getter 
 You get down, but you ain't a gold digger 
 You got the soul with the figure to match 
 Your girlfriend said "yo that dude is a catch, 
 Creative with the gifts plus he hit it from the back" 
 In places we ain't supposed to 
 We makin' music baby, you on the vocals 
 International lover, I never stay local 
 Go to places that you've never been 
 Beautiful outside, even better when it's in 
 You have arrived girl, you can come again 
 Come on 
 (Chorus - d'angelo) 
 You have come so far, you've got so far to go 
 Say it again 
 You have come so far, you've got so far to go... 
 Hoo... yeah... 
 (Common) 
 You sexy, I know brothers try to spit to you 
 But I'm the only one that could get to you 
 Liftin' you, my drive is shiftin' you 
 I opened your freak, it's like a gift in you 
 I truly and thickly am thankful 
 Long as I'm in your town I'ma stay faithful 
 Ha, you know I can't escape you 
 No matter how far, you're still my star 
 You was there when lamar try to steal my car 
 Snappin' with me, that's just how real you are 
 Sophisticated woman, you understand a man 
 You don't call all the time just to see where I am 
 Put a g in your hand, make sure you're livin' all right 
 Makin' love is me and I'ma give it all night 
 Turn over in the mornin', make it warmer and better 
 Long as we can be, we can come together 
 Come on 
 (Chorus - d'angelo) 
 You have come so far, you've got so far to go 
 I don't believe you heard me baby, 
 You have come so far, you've got so far to go... 
 Go on, go on baby 
 Go on, go on girl 
 Go on, go on 
 Go on baby, go on baby 
 Go on baby, go on baby 
 Go on... 
 You have come so far, you've got so far to go 
 Know what I mean baby? 
 You have come so far, you've got so far to go... 
 You have come so far, you've got so far to go 
 You have come so far, you've got so far to go...
