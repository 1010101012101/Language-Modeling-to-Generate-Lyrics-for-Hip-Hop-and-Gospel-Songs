[Common sample] And you say Chi city 
 We don't stop naw we don't quit 
 I rap with the passion of Christ, nigga cross me 
 Took it outta space and niggas thought they lost me 
 I'm back like a chiropract wit b-boy survival rap 
 This ain't '94 Joe we can't go back 
 The game need a makeover 
 My man retired, I'ma "Takeover" 
 Tell these halftime niggas, "Break's over" 
 I'm raw hustlas getcha bakin' soda 
 Too many rape the culture 
 Leave rappers with careers and their faith over 
 It's a war goin' on, you can't fake bein' a soldier 
 In the basement listenin' to tapes of Ultramagnetic to the fact the messiah's black 
 I turn the TV down we could take it higher than that 
 I wonder if these wack niggas realize they wack 
 And they the reason my people say they tired of rap 
 Inspired by black Muslims and Christian 
 Pushin' Cutlasses, dope, and other traditions 
 In the conditions of the city, the city, the city, the city, the city, the city, c'mon 
 A black figure, in the middle of chaos and gun fire 
 So many raps about rims, I'm surprised niggas ain't become tires 
 On the street you turn code and then go screech 
 I tell 'em, "Fuck 'em!" like I do the police 
 The beast in runnin' rampant 
 I'm in between sheets tryna have sex that's tantric 
 But the ghetto, tryna make a get up stand up anthem 
 You spit hot garbage son of Sanford 
 What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich? 
 I slap a nigga like you 
 And tell him Rick James bitch 
 Witcha Hollywood stories on porches 
 We prolly heard stories on who became rich 
 And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch 
 You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch 
 I'm forever puttin' words together 
 Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons 
 The name Com has never been involved in Run 
 Unless it's DMC or runnin' these broads to bein' free 
 I'm harder than the times, you hardly scary 
 Holdin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry 
 They ask me where hip hop is goin', it's Chicagoin' 
 Poetry's in motion like a picture, now showin' 
 It's the city, the city y'all, the city, the city y'all 
 C'mon
