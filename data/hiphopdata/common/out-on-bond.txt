Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces 
 Plastic bag carryin', no toothpastes 
 IPhone, belt by Gucci 
 Bands with loose change and some car keys 
 To the Maserati, license plate read 'GODBODY' 
 Passenger side only ride hot bodies 
 When we was young as we wanted, show our bodies 
 Cadillac Com from the Southside army 
 The army now, don't try to harm me now 
 It's my time, you can't alarm me now 
 I ball, bitches wanna palm me now 
 Vacation in palm tree style 
 In the morning where the dons be now 
 Drinkin' lattes, over breakfast I pray and end it with an ashe 
 Cops say we lookin' for a nigga that's dressed nice 
 Seats be goin' way back just like Just-Ice 
 Black leather wearin' justice on the collar 
 Change is we only ain't trustin' the dollars 
 Try to get me, get wet like bed sheets 
 Poli' with technique, and let the text speak 
 Like the led conference I rap off the head conscience 
 Freestyle, free trap niggaz from bondage 
 Every word you heard is bond is 
 Double-0-87, on some Bond shit, I'm out on bond 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond) 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond) 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond) 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames 
 Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces 
 Los Padrinos to juvenile placement 
 All for C-notes, the feds confiscatin' 
 Back to that block with brains on the pavement 
 Paid restitution, O from the lootin' 
 Took 'cause they did it, you was influenced 
 Your mind gone, life don't seem much bigger 
 Than your time zone, broke as the rich get richer 
 Blunt-burnt lips and a worn-out liver 
 That's everyday livin', guns everywhere chillin' 
 Got you feelin' like there's money comin' sooner than later 
 Till then, I'll be runnin' from the judge and the bailiff 
 Crime committin' cause these women love a man in Mercedes 
 I never save for when it's rainy, hope Jehovah can save me 
 While I'm out dumb buyin', tryin' to find my time 
 Till I hit the main line in that cell confined 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond) 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond) 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond) 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames 
 Classic rap music, rollin' in the Range 
 Preposterous chains, top notch dames 
 Classic rap music, rollin' in the Range
