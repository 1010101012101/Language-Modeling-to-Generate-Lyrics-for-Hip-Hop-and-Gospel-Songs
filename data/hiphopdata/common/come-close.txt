Common Feat. Mary J Blige - "Come Close" 
 (Verse 1) {Common} 
 Are we living in a dream world? 
 Are your eyes still green girl? 
 I know you're sick and tired of arguing, 
 But you can't keep it bottled in 
 Jealousy, we gotta swallow it. 
 Your heart and mind, Baby, follow it 
 Smile, happiness, you can model it 
 And when you feel opposite 
 I just want you to know 
 Your whole being is beautiful 
 I'm 'a do the best I can do 
 'Cause I'm the best when I'm with you 
 (Chorus) {Mary J. Blige} 
 Come close to me, Baby 
 Let your love hold you 
 I know this world gets crazy 
 What's it without you? (nothing nothing) 
 (Verse 2) {Common} 
 Put down your bags, Love 
 I know in the past, Love 
 It's been sorta hard on you 
 But I see the god in you 
 I just wanna nurture it 
 Though this love may hurt a bit 
 We dealing with this water love 
 You even give my daughter love 
 I wanna build a tribe with you 
 Protect and provide for you 
 Truth is I can't hide from you 
 The pimp in me, may have to die with you 
 (Chorus) {Mary J. Blige} 
 Come close to me, Baby (Come close to me, Baby) 
 Let your love hold you (Let your love hold you) 
 I know this world gets crazy 
 What's it without you? (What's this world without you) 
 (Bridge) {Mary j. Blige} 
 I know what you're thinking: You're on my mind 
 You're right, you're right, you're right 
 You promise too fast. it just might take time (slow down a minute babe) 
 I hope you're not tired tonight, tonight 
 (Verse 3) {Common} 
 You helped me to discover me 
 I just want you to put trust in me 
 I kinda laugh when you cuss at me 
 The aftermath is you touching me 
 It's destiny that we connected girl 
 You and I, we can affect the world 
 I'm tired of the fast lane 
 I want you to have my last name 
 (Chorus) {Mary J. Blige} 
 Come close to me, Baby (Come close to me, Baby) 
 Let your love home you (Let me move you tonight, Baby) 
 I know this world gets crazy 
 What's it without you? (we gonna make it) 
 I love you, I love you, I love you 
 (Bridge till fade) {Mary j. Blige} 
 I know what you're thinking: You're on my mind 
 You're right, you're right, you're right 
 You promise too fast. It just might take time 
 I hope you're not tired tonight, tonight
