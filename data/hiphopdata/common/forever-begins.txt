Victory won 
 In a world of Henessey and guns 
 Too young for the marches 
 But I remember these drums 
 To start reality 
 Wars and battles 
 We fought for ours 
 Caught in ghetto tragedy 
 I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee 
 And recognize the importance of family 
 Hand me the joint 
 Good music and room to breathe 
 Those that doubt 
 Com' will soon believe 
 Can't judge the weave 
 My lady had one 
 I'm more like a fool 
 For soul and passion 
 The price of gas rises 
 Street life is pumpin' fast 
 Lives is 
 I'm watch crash 
 And realize that we all survivors 
 No religion or race 
 Whatever describe us 
 My guys do dirt do dirt 
 But never really talk about it 
 Forever begins 
 Just because I thought about it 
 Living 
 Once Again 
 We 
 Living 
 Then you go (x4) 
 Ashes and snowfalls 
 I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come 
 Forever gon come 
 It's a cold world 
 And I can never go numb 
 Look 
 Fear in the eyes 
 Say I never gon run 
 Sooner or later 
 I know the cheddar gon' come 
 For now I write the world letters 
 To better the young 
 On tree by jury 
 Together we hung 
 Now we let our chains hang 
 And gang bang to maintain 
 Ghanastan goin' through the same thing 
 It trickles down 
 At each other we aim pain 
 I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars 
 Through the while I learned to earn hard 
 Watch gangstas turn God in the mist of war 
 No matter how much I elevate, 
 I kiss the floor 
 It was in the ?? when she said Dilla was gone 
 That's when I knew we'd live forever 
 Through song 
 *** 
 Origin 
 Is forever 
 Well, well well, 
 We are back in the studio again 
 Look at that 
 Hey I don' need no cue cards 
 They got the engineers holdin' up the cue cards 
 What that say 
 Oh they say, just talk, don't sing 
 Son, I bet you and I feel like you and I've been here forever 
 30 years old red eyes, 
 Beholding red eyes 
 I see my world's tears 
 Yeah, origin is forever 
 Every peak will have 2 values 
 Hopeful eyes in the comfort 
 Of true protection and admiration of the chime 
 That's forever 
 Forever is to strive 
 A place of endearment 
 Forever is what I leave 
 My I-self contribution 
 Damn, what I gon' leave? 
 Ok... 
 I leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand 
 To universal scales of humanity, all humanity 
 Forever is finding a solution to a solution 
 Tsunamis, hurricanes, 
 Following the trails of the African slave ships 
 War, war, and more war 
 Floods, Columbine, Global Warming, Earthquakes 
 Another somebody done me wrong, son 
 Virginia Tech, is not an, "Oh, What the heck." 
 We're still, did you place your one grain 
 Of spiritual sand forever? 
 Confusion need a solution 
 Blend and stir, stir and blend 
 The part of humanity; sift the ingredients 
 Of acknowledgment, apology, amendment, atone 
 We gonna work with the four A's here 
 Forever part 
 Common good is forever 
 God's memory is forever
