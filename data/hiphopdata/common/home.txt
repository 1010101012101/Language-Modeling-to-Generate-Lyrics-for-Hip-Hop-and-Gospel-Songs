A man who's genius and freedoms and -- 
 Ability to communicate and -- 
 To talk, and to touch chords -- 
 A man who has the ability and the audacity 
 And the -- of God to stand up, to stand up 
 Heard the sound of the trumpets, the voice from the throne 
 Seen the twenty-four elders and I knew I was home 
 I was told to write songs for the people 
 Take the original Hebrews on an Exodus of Black Excellence 
 Tell them to invest in us and make testaments about each other 
 Or how we sisters and brothers 
 Cover the land in corners of poems and stone 
 Go hard with it, let 'em know you God with it 
 Even though I authored it, let no one margin it 
 And make it all about paper or first weeks sales 
 Though this is from Heaven give 'em verses from Hell 
 Those that fell off the path, bring them back to the Mass 
 The staff can be your microphone 
 Your name is Common 
 You was born to fight the norm 
 Take house niggas outta darkness till they lights is on 
 I'mma put a hyphen on your name 
 Rapper-actor-activist 
 You the one that can reach into the black abyss 
 Stars this asterix, show 'em what a classic is 
 Freedom riders need passengers 
 And your lyrics use scriptures and passages 
 To make them rise like Lazarus 
 And resurrected again, they'll put disrespect on your name and respect it again 
 Every section you in, bless 'em and keep bussin' 
 If they don't like it, shake the dust and say 'fuck em' 
 Until you get home, I'm the one you trust in 
 I'm happy to be in any place 
 Where God's name is remembered 
 Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world 
 Trouble of this world, trouble of this world 
 Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world 
 Going home to live 
 Going home to live 
 Going home to live 
 Go into the wilderness like Mussa on a pilgrimage 
 Streets are villages, speak with diligence 
 And authority to fake god of pharisees and sadducees 
 Give them that Gardley free from the Black Odyssey 
 Yo pardon me, you the God bodily 
 Functioning on earth as a part of me 
 That's why I gave you artistry 
 Go into the hoods with the shooters and the strippers 
 Forget the New World Order, New Jerusalem is with us 
 Tell sisters they earths and goddesses 
 If they got bottom, don't get caught in a bottomless 
 Pit, there's a lot of us fit for the kingdom is near 
 You can tell by the wars and how the seasons appear 
 You'll appear in circles in Hollywood, I birthed you 
 And Chicago, you know how to parlay good 
 You'll get Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys 
 Give those to your family, don't get caught up in the vanity 
 Or the world's insanity 
 Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world 
 Trouble of this world, trouble of this world 
 Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world 
 Going home to live 
 Going home to live 
 With God 
 To those of you who are unfamiliar with those words 
 They mean, in English, 'Peace, be unto you'
