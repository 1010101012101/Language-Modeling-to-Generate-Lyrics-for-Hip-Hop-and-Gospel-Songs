 Common: 
 Good morning Vietcom, I'm back 
 Huh, it's me again, is it me you're looking for? (Yup) 
 For the perfect beat, sweetly oblique 
 I'm fresh, I come clean, but I can't whistle 
 Pss, I'm only buggin' 
 While No dug in the crates, I dug in my nose 
 And picked a rhyme any rhyme I don't have any time 
 To waste, I'm hip, don't even trip 
 To an easy travel agent now we fly for free 
 I can be fly for free, you want some fire tree then buy from me 
 I got the flame like UIC but I be, UAC 
 Some of the realest illest chillest cats you may see 
 In your life if you get one 
 Rappers are like jobs to me, why? Because they get done 
 Here it comes I'm as able as Cain to get raw 
 That's why the DJ's mix me, I'm gonna bust dicks 
 This is not da bomb so save all your threats 
 I'm good to go and also I'm Rets 
 Rhymes I wrecks affects the roughnecks 
 Down to the preps in the Polos, the studs with 'fros 
 Hoes with weaves, the bald-headed to the dreaded 
 To folks with butters, high rollers in rollers 
 Players with plats studs with stockin' caps, I be rockin' raps till I collapse 
 Niggas play my tape about as much as they do craps 
 I'm on point, I cee-lo, I see high 
 Hi C, I'm free at last 
 I'mma free man, free as World B 
 And like an early bird, I'm special 
 Well ain't that special, as Ed and Vesta 
 So to myself I say congratulations 
 I'm glad you had the patience, you better have the patience 'cause this is me

 Common: 
 What's up Scony Rony? I'm that boney homey 
 From Stony (Common) you know me 
 Off the GP niggas see me on the TV 
 Talkin' Take It EZ and they was like, "He ain't hardcore" 
 But hardcore is far more than bats and gats 
 It stems back to the roots of being true 
 It's gonna get me me, you just get you you 
 What I look like, talkin' about some shit I ain't do? 
 I ain't shoot nobody I ain't shank nobody 
 I ain't kill nobody, it wasn't us it was them 
 The Warriors, I'm a warrior and still don't have to sho-gun 
 It takes one to know one, and no one can tell me 
 How to be, 'cause I'mma be me, aight? 
 'Cause I'm a man, now check it

 Common: 
 Sometimes, sometimes, I get a good feeling 
 When I'm chillin' at the flat, lookin' at the wall 
 Wondering can I come off of it, I'm off a bit 
 On the mic I be talkin' shit 
 But some say my talk don't make no sense 
 I'm tryin' to make dollars 
 My mama told me to go to school and be a scholar, but school ain't for me 
 So don't even go there, I'm comin' out of nowhere, to go where 
 Probably in about seven years, I won't have no hair 
 But not only am I the Hair Club President, I'm also a client 
 I come off like a toupee, I still have to pay 2Pc Dark 
 A Raider that never Lost the Ark, on the shot 
 But now when I shoot rock, I be all out of breath 
 My boy Adefo wanted to be a chef 
 But he went down South, and fell in love call me love 
 'Cause love is gonna getcha I'mma getcha 
 I'm like BJ, my arm is strong and I stretch ya 
 Styles from East to West, all across the country 
 I'm like that big fat woman cause cats wanna bump me 
 I probably would get bumped more if I was a gangster 
 But I am a gangsta, call me the gangsta of love 
 I love my music, I love my mama 
 I love myself, I love you, and you love me and this is, I'm out 
 Yo I wanna say peace to my moms, my grandmama 
 Little Chandra and John, yo rest in peace to my Aunt Stella 
 My side's moms, Ron's moms, Dawn's moms, Corey's moms 
 Who are you? These people be themselves y'all, peace 'em out
