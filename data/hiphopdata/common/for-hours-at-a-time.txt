I've got shackles on my feet and chains across my hands 
 It's 3 A.M and I'm soaking in the rain 
 Stuck to this sidewalk for hours 
 And I've got this feeling I'm close to you 
 But you're not close enough to me 
 Just let me pull you in 
 Into the moonlight 
 As I look to your window your shadow is sillouhetted 
 And outside the lights turn on 
 And the ringing in my ears is just cars 
 Yelling at me with shouts of fear 
 A feeling dropped as I run from this night 
 So giving up isn't giving in 
 Cause once more I will go
