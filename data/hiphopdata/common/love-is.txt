(Yeah, Love is Love. 
 God is Love.) 3X 
 How beautiful Love can be 
 On the streets love is hard to see 
 It's a place I got to be 
 Loving You is Loving Me. 
 How beautiful Love can be 
 On the streets love is hard to see 
 Gotta reach that frequency 
 Loving You is Loving Me. 
 1st Verse: 
 Yeah, you know what love is 
 Even found it on the ground where the thugs live 
 My man had to dig deep to find his 
 Couldn't sleep cause on the real he had 5 kids 
 Live nigs, real niccas express and chase it 
 In crap games, black dames and big faces 
 Cases in court, Fam showing loving support 
 You and your baby's mom thought that Love was a sport 
 As men we were taught to hold it in 
 That's why we don't know how till we older men 
 If Love is a place, Ima go again 
 At least now, now I know to go within 
 At times it can take ya for a spin 
 Heartbreak hotel then you're home again 
 I seen Love make a nicca soul pretend 
 Like a story that he don't want to end 
 2nd Verse: 
 It's all Love where we come from 
 In the hood Loved we was told to run from 
 That same hood where the gun sung 
 We holla Love hoping it become one 
 Crack got so many lives undone 
 From lack of Love many hide, some run 
 I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays 
 Demonstration with a man had her trapped in a maze 
 Tryin' to find herself to regain much of that she had gave 
 Love can free us to which some react as a slave 
 Funny, we love 'em more when they relaxed in a grave 
 Wonder if a thug is raw, or is he acting afraid? 
 Everybody loves somebody but I attract shade 
 Heard of the love of money, but compassionate pays 
 Talk about it with my youth so she understand 
 What it is to be loved by a man. (Unnh!) 
 3rd Verse: 
 Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often 
 Seen the hardest niccas soften with his homie in a coffin 
 We walk in, stand and fall in it 
 With the right companion, we all in it 
 Mary sang a song about it 
 Having broad limits in the game of life 
 It's the scrimmage 
 Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days 
 A letter to the people... "Love always"!
