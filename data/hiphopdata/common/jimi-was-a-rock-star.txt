Erykah Badu and Common (deeply): 
 Everyone hides their face, 
 Sets behind a mask they wear. 
 Jimi was a rock star 
 Searching for that magic place 
 That 
 He could touch 
 In the sky 
 Just to get his people high. 
 Oh (jack!) 
 Oh oh oh 
 Oh oh 
 Oh oh 
 Oh (jack!) (repeat) 
 Life is so, colorful 
 Reds, blues and dreams. 
 Jimi lives in a purple haze, 
 In a psychadelic maze. 
 Playing the streets like and instrument: 
 Pulling strings wherever he went. 
 Angel sent 
 From the sky 
 Just to get his people high. 
 Oh (jack!) 
 Oh 
 Oh oh 
 Oh oh 
 Oh (jack!) (repeat) 
 Women all around (eh da da daaa da) 
 Fast cars and sound (eh da da daaa da) 
 And freedom he was bound (eh da da daaa da) 
 Couldn't see the ground (eh da da daaa da) 
 Jimi come out why don't you set me free?! 
 (Set me free) 
 So high 
 Born to fly 
 Getting high off his own supply 
 ? 
 Everybody follows the same lord 
 Using his light to guide the way 
 ? 
 ?...Try things but few die so young 
 Something among 
 Jimi was stung 
 Everyone 
 Hides their face 
 Sets behind a mask they wear 
 (Back ground: Jimi come out why don't you set me free?) Till end
