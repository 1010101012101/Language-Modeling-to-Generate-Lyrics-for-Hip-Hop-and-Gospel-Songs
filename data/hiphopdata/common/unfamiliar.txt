What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me 
 And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 But I could get used to it 
 I could get used to it, I could get... 
 Why don't I take the time and then (?) my baby doll? 
 Why don't I take the to get you anything you want? 
 'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 But I could get used to it 
 I could get used to it, I could get... 
 Love never gave a limit, wait a minute, stay up in it 
 Everyday we give it, play to win it, way we live it 
 My heart you cannot visit, stay extended 
 The lot we love, we lay up in it, days is vivid 
 Same incentive, the way we hid it is like Will and Jada did it 
 A house is not a home unless we staying in it, stay committed 
 I used to get around, now I'm staying centered 
 Angels ascended, grounded, stay cemented 
 The mentality, we all casualties, I can't do this casually 
 Actually you challenge me to balance me 
 Pay dues and salaries, been through truce and fallacies 
 The unfamiliar (?) made me lose calories 
 In a house rewind playing Amy's "Valerie" 
 Then I realized the past ain't my reality 
 On love's balcony, you standing out for me 
 This is alchemy, unashamed and undoubtedly 
 Now I see 
 What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me 
 And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 But I could get used to it 
 I could get used to it, I could get... 
 Why don't I take the time and then (?) my baby doll? 
 Why don't I take the to get you anything you want? 
 'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 But I could get used to it 
 I could get used to it, I could get... 
 This love's a lobby, clicks the way that "T. D." Jakes described it 
 Vibrant thing the way that Tip from Tribe would sing 
 So many things that you provide the king 
 You too fly, never should you hide your wings 
 The awakening, let's keep breaking things 
 Break them rules, break them laws, breaking through 
 Breaking walls, sacred thoughts 
 Are the oceans that we breaking 'cross 
 The truth is a naked cloth 
 No need to take it off, the weight is off 
 Love we making due is unbreakable, relatable 
 Stayed in you, relayed into the faith in you 
 You awaken to what fate can do 
 Fate is inescapable, super friends, we capable 
 To take it to a greater view they say is unattainable 
 I paint for you a picture I'm forever in it with ya 
 Love it when we hang, in my life, you're a fixture 
 A mixture of love (?) scriptures 
 The right elixir, my spirit I pour to enrich ya 
 I'm with ya 
 What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me 
 And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 But I could get used to it 
 I could get used to it, I could get... 
 Why don't I take the time and then (?) my baby doll? 
 Why don't I take the to get you anything you want? 
 'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar 
 But I could get used to it 
 I could get used to it, I could get...
