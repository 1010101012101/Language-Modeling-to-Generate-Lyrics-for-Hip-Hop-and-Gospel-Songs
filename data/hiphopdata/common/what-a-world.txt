What do you see when you look at me 
 And I am just standing there 
 Shit that makes all much work?? 
 That's what's in my blood 
 And I won't stop until I cut 
 Cause my life just burned out 
 So I keep down in a wollen town?? 
 Till I reach the top 
 What a world 
 What a world [x4] 
 A little boy from Chicago had ?? to be a star
