The city it blow deep 
 I know them cold streets 
 Motif is no peace 
 Can't trust the police 
 My mama stay out East 
 Hope that she good though 
 She from Inglewood so she know the hood though 
 Corners we stood on 
 That's what I stand for 
 Justice for hustlers I rap and I chant for 
 [?] Just got off that thang on his ankle 
 He seeing that corner from a new angle 
 Same old to same old 
 Some days are painful 
 They say be careful 
 Grandma be stay prayerful 
 My [?] move words with their eyes on [?] 
 You in the ghetto where we never settle 
 The breath of the city 
 No rest for the weary 
 No stress it can't hear me 
 A fist full of fury 
 No dollars no jewellery 
 A Chicago story 
 Place that can kill me is one that can cure me 
 Hard to ignore me 'cause we livin' loud now 
 Fire inside me and things that go "Bow Bow" 
 Label me wild child, my old man on trial now 
 Yeah I'm the future but live for the now now 
 Make my mama proud now 
 We come from that dirt 
 I put in that work 
 Until my back hurt 
 Uh
