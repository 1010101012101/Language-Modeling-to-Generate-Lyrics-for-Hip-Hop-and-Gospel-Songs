Boom it and you boom it and you boom it in your jeep 
 Type of shit that hit when you pump it in your trunk 
 Boom it and you boom it and you boom it in your jeep 
 Babum, babum, make the speakers pop 
 I'm as bad, bad as Leroy Brown, Brown 
 I'm a pro p-pro, but not a noun n-noun 
 If you got beef, beef, you get ground, ground 
 Cut up in soul, soul by the pound for pound 
 I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the brown mound 
 Not a rebound, but like a hound, I get down 
 Never wore a leash but I'm a show ya 
 How loose is my goose, got more soul than combat boots 
 (I got soul, you got it) That's why I came 
 They keep calling me, man, they keep calling me, they call my name 
 And say, I can't give it away, give it away now 
 Or say whiz, say what or say how 
 Sh, ok, between you and me, man it's all this white rap 
 I got the power, hachoo, I'll just bite snap 
 Bum ba-bum, bum bum 
 Think fast, 'cause I'm the Ramadan 
 Ahoy-he-hoy-he, I'm Fat Boy 
 Shibidabibidabee, boom boom, I'll be the bad boy 
 Having a party, but I'm not a democrat 
 Spoiled as a child, but now I'm milk like similak 
 Don't have Cinemax because my cable's pirated 
 Bug out wit the rhyme, try to swat and I'll get fly wit it 
 For pest control, I suggest some soul 
 Porridge, shit, I got it, but I have no breath control 
 So gimme a TO, baby like um, Chris Webber 
 I got myself together 
 Now I'm straight, are you straight, if you straight, then I'm straight 
 Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake 
 Roll to the rock, rock to the roll 
 Can't no A & R tell me that I ain't got soul 
 C'mon, can I get a clap, can't you see I'm trapped 
 And I'm so confused 
 News is getting paid but what about the bills 
 I wanna make some doe yet I wanna show my skills 
 Do you even know where I'm going 
 I ain't scared of you muthafuker, though I am of the Omen 
 I jam like a cobra, make note, I'm not caress 
 'Cause I control minds wit rhymes, so FBI don't test 
 I got a no. 2 pencil and I'm a scribble all over your face 
 You see I don't pack no gat 
 I didn't see CB4 'cause I heard that shit was wack 
 Like Chris I rock, I'm strapped like my jock 
 Peace to NO ID and my nigga Why Not, check it 
 Wopee, look at me, I'm hipper than a hippie 
 Chicks flyer than the boots, so all the MC's say you make me sick 
 Well go see the doctor, in your car, rock my tune 
 Wit the Boom shak lak lak boom 
 I'll buy you on a cracker, bayow, watch where the sparks went 
 Fatter than Dre, a Lover like Ed, super as Clark Kent 
 So give it away Lois, as I change clothes without a booth 
 And ride like this, like woof 
 The roof is on fire, it's not an LA riot 
 I got more ho, ho ho's than the jolly green giant 
 Large as the Professor and I'm never faking funk cock 
 Fat as heavy metal yet I'm harder than punk rock 
 So take me to a land I know not too far away 
 I got skills like Tim and I'm coming in a hardaway 
 So keep the crossover, common as a b-boy 
 While you be dragging last, I be kicking like Bruce lee would 
 Sho nuff, yo I got the stuff that tops the stove 
 And I am about to explo-o-o-ode 
 Who was that masked kid, that's what'cha ask kid 
 Free to be stroke, cut throat, Lonnie or ?rash? it 
 But oh no, this was Common wit his soul glow 
 Coming from Chicag- but yo I gotta go- go 
 The go, check, check the go (ha-ha) the go, check check the go (yeah)
