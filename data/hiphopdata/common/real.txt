You niggas ain't real 
 I think you need to stop pretending 
 These niggas ain't ill 
 We know the deal 
 Niggas ain't on 
 Here today and the next you're gone 
 'Cause you niggas ain't real 
 And we know the deal 
 Yeah we know the deal 
 Eighty seven strip walker 
 I'm a shit talker 
 Fuck all night your dependent what I'm offer 
 Had a white girl I tossed her 
 Black girl I lost her 
 Break bread with the stones I'm the rock of Gibraltar 
 Salt of the earth for what it's worth yo from birth 
 I was first with a verse live niggas don't rehearse 
 Wear the prophets on the shirt 
 Yeah yeah that's the creed 
 I can give a fuck if it's real or a weave 
 I tell you when you look good and keep it right there 
 I'm as important to the Chi as my nigga Mike Air 
 Jordan threes on the feet as we breeze down Lakeshore 
 These are the days that we bake more to make more 
 I been living in the moment lately 
 It's like the love and the hate seem to motivate me 
 Lady lady, that body crazy 
 You been working out of this thing if it's not tell me if it's really real 
 You niggas ain't real 
 I think you need to stop pretending 
 These niggas ain't ill 
 We know the deal

 Here today and the next you're gone 
 'Cause you niggas ain't real 
 And we know the deal 
 Yeah we know the deal 
 I'm the sole controller 
 Opposite of sober 
 Flow from the south side to south Angola 
 Mami wanna strip then yeah I'mma poke her 
 And go all in and stretch it out like yoga 
 I'm flexin' sexin' oiled up like Texan 
 Survivor soldier a child is destined 
 A star is born in a Chicago storm 
 The name is Common 
 I'm anything but the norm, uh 
 Six in the mornin' something warm informing 
 I'm sweatin' like I'm performing on tour in, uh 
 Y'all fuckin' with this like porn 
 Put ya fists up 'cause you know I ride on 
 New planes and plateaus 
 Made it through the black hole 
 I rhyme in a timeless capsule 
 I rap fo', niggas in the barber shops and broads that's hot 
 I run the town I'm a fuckin' juggernaut 
 This shit is real 
 You niggas ain't real 
 I think you need to stop pretending 
 These niggas ain't ill 
 We know the deal 
 Niggas ain't on 
 Here today and the next you're gone 
 'Cause you niggas ain't real 
 And we know the deal 
 Yeah we know the deal 
 You niggas ain't real

 These niggas ain't ill 
 We know the deal 
 Niggas ain't on 
 Here today and the next you're gone 
 'Cause you niggas ain't real 
 And we know the deal 
 Yeah we know the deal
