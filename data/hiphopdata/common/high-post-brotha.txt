Everybody wants the hero 
 Who just wants the man? 
 Who fights with his devils 
 And does the best he can 
 Everybody wants a playa 
 I just want to be friends 
 Every 
 Everybody wants a superstar 
 Who got cars and ice 
 Walks into the ghetto get pussy bar 
 Makes all the girls look think twice 
 Yeah sista he got money and thangs 
 But is he nice for you 
 He's a High Post Brotha 
 With money in his pocket 
 He got every-thing a girl could want 
 Think maybe he don't 
 High Post Brotha 
 Wit money in his pocket 
 He got everything a girl could want 
 I think maybe he don't 
 Some sistas want tha balla 
 But mentally can he really play ball 
 Dumbfounded by out the ghetto conversations 
 His mentality's oh so so small 
 Get the cream 
 Get the hoes 
 Get the cars 
 He wants to go far 
 But how far is too far 
 (Com'mon) 
 Come here love (chickka) love 
 Let me holla at you 
 'Cause what you got 
 Is worth more than a dollar or two 
 Soil another nigga's game 
 Usually I wouldn't do 
 But you my girl 
 And I can tell that its bothering you 
 This motherah must think that he a father to you 
 You got vision but boys blockin the view 
 I know he payin' yo tuition 
 Payin' to get the car fixin 
 He got Juice or is he Pulp Fiction 
 Heard he be strip clubs 
 Flippin duhs like he got big buhs 
 Is it his image 
 Or him that you in love with 
 You on some shit but you was never superficial 
 When rent's due is trip what a chick do 
 You don't like his mind 
 The way he looks 
 And you said that his breath stinks 
 But all of that added up 
 Doesn't equal a fresh mink 
 Let's think who you are 
 You the
