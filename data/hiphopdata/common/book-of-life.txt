Double Trouble: 
 Here's a little that must be told 
 From beginning to end 
 Here's a little story that must be told 
 From beginning to end} 
 Common: 
 I got so much trouble on my mind so I take time out my day 
 To pray and I say, now lay me down to sleep, hopin' that I keep my soul 
 Peep, I'm gettin' old and this a cold, cold world and I ain't even got a bomber 
 Livin' with my mama, it's the same routine 
 Keep my room clean, I'm lookin' to do some new things 
 But ain't shit to do, I'm twenty-two, catch 
 In the prime of my life, I have no time for a wife 
 I funnel through the tunnel, disgruntled, tryin' to find me some light 
 In the rim of darkness, I too sing I may not be the darkest, brother 
 But I was always told to act my age, not my color 
 Not knowin' that my color, was out of the original 
 So now I sing the new negro spiritual 
 It goes, "Get up, stand up 
 Stand up for your rights 
 Get up, stand up 
 Don't give up the fight" 
 It's like, how can you understand the pain 
 When you never had to stand under the rain? 
 When it rains, it pours and it's about to come down hard 
 Thank God I found you

 Common: 
 As I walk down the road of existence, I get resistance from all angles 
 I tangle for cash, hopin' it'll last till the end of the week 
 But all I eat is fast food 
 And you know how junk food goes right through ya 
 So I return to the a-rab, then on the way back 
 I stop- at the liquor store, grab me a six pack 
 Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back to get some more 
 Once I get started I don't wanna stop, ah 
 And I can't turn around, brew, I can't turn it down 
 Ironically I turn it up, my liver I burn it up 
 It's my life I live it up, the cup I gotta give it up 
 One day, I'm cruisin' down a one-way street 
 And I done passed fun day, three blocks ago 
 It itself, life is an obstacle 
 As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible 
 I want a job but I ain't lookin' (How come?) 
 I ain't tryin' to degrade myself, bein' nobody's Calvin I'm a couch bum 
 What makes it bad, I had incentive 
 But that disintegrated to a state that stagnated, I procrastinated 
 I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated, or blowed 
 I'm dealin' with a full deck, at any day I can fold 
 What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand 
 And I had a plan but things didn't go through 
 The way they were supposed to, thank God I found you

 Common: 
 It's like a jungle, sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under 
 I ponder and try to keep my concentration in this idiotic nation 
 They say become a doctor, but I don't have the patience 
 Adjacent to that situation, I want an occupation that I'm into 
 'Cause yet have I begin to live to my potential, I went to 
 School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience 
 I reminisce and wish I could go back in time to '89 when there was just sunshine 
 But now it's like, I'm gettin' older there's so much strain and stress 
 I don't think I'll ever be happy until I rest in peace 
 Of mind, and find who I am but thank God I found you
