Phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked 
 But for some reason i decided to answer it 
 On the other end was a French accent 
 He told me we needed to rap quick 
 'Cause he had did some bad shit 
 And would be gone for years, spending these last two days, 
 with his mama and his kid 
 When he spoke, I wasn't trying to hear it 
 'Cause I knew he was a real good person 
 And this didn't seem like it was in his spirit 
 He couldn't believe as much as I couldn't, what he done 
 He said now its time for him to turn himself in 
 No longer could he run, from life, from God 
 I started thinkin', why is doing right is so hard 
 I got back to him when we was in London discussin the New Testament 
 and how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it 
 Ny voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go 
 He said you know, turn to Matthew 24 
 He said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day 
 But the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you astray 
 As long as God is with me, everything will be okay 
 So right about then, we decided to pray 
 Just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray 
 Deep into clouds (deep into clouds) 
 It's makin' things appear to me so clearly 
 Deep in the clouds (deep in the clouds) 
 just lyin' back makin' the smoke disperse a ray 
 Deep in the clouds (deep in the clouds) 
 It's makin' things appear to me so clearly 
 Deep into clouds 
 Your time is a terrible to waste 
 For it's 
 not one of the...possesions that you can bring to space 
 (yeah, it don't matter) 
 It's a challenge 
 But the chance of seeing is quite a dream to chase 
 (yes it is) 
 I hope 
 I remind God of him when he sees my face, yeah 
 He gon' see it 
 The feeling just keeps on lifting me higher (ever) 
 And it's everflowing it's, everflowing 
 (keeps on ) 
 When everything puts a smile on my face 
 (ever-flowing, ever-flowing) 
 And I recognize the strong goal 
 But I keep on going, I keep on going 
 (he keeps on going) 
 I keep on going on 
 (he keeps on going) 
 Oh mighty love, watching over me 
 A smile, brilliant 
 All over, constantly 
 Warm, comforting 
 Perfect, like nothing 
 No hate..no confusion, no strain 
 Simply peace 
 Simply, simply, simply, simply 
 No fear! Heaven is to me 
 No fear of destruction 
 Understanding who he is 
 His name is Christ, yeah 
 Heaven, heaven is to me 
 Wisdom, understanding, knowledge 
 (Oh understanding) 
 Streets of gold and pearly gates 
 Halos wings all dressed in white, hah hah 
 Angels sing and cymbals glare 
 No one's rich no one's poor, hah hah 
 People dreaming they live free 
 Making love while they in love, hah hah 
 Wonderful dream wake me when you're home haa! 
 haahhhaa haaaaaaiiiiahahah! 
 Heaven, heaven is being pops 
 Heaven is spending the day with your grandchildren 
 Listenin' to they voices whenand they laughing and play 
 And then at the end of the day we hug we kiss and slowly they walk away 
 And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me 'round the knees 
 Yeah, that's Heaven to me
