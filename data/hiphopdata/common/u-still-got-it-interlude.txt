Do I look fat to you? 
 Baby you know I love you 
 That's not what I asked you 
 Uh, uh, uh, uh 
 Girl I know your going crazy 
 Let me help you understand 
 That you're about to have my baby 
 And we about to be a fam 
 Don't you know when we got married 
 We'd be true through thick and thin? 
 Well I know you're lookin' thick now 
 But I'm witcha to the end you still got it 
 You still got it girl every day, every night 
 You know you rock my world 
 (Don't you know that you still got it?) 
 And your emotions flowin' 
 'Cause you know that your body's growin' 
 (Don't you know that you still got it) 
 That New Jersey's snug 
 Well I ain't mad at that baby 
 It's just more to love 
 (You still got it) 
 Oh baby, your love's crazy 
 'Cause you havin' my baby 
 (And there's so much more to love) 
 See you walkin' through the mall now 
 You see them outfits that you like 
 Oh but you scared to try them on now 
 'Cause they just won't fit you right 
 And you steady watchin' Oprah 
 Tryin' to redefine your life 
 But as long as you're my lady 
 I don't care about your size 
 Your hair 
 (Your hair I know) 
 I know your feet are swelling 
 No need to cry I dig them thighs 
 That's why I'm telling you, you still got it 
 You still got it girl every day, every night 
 You know you rock my world 
 (Don't you know that you still got it?) 
 And your emotions flowin' 
 'Cause you know that your body's growin' 
 (Don't you know that you still got it) 
 That New Jersey's snug 
 Well I ain't mad at that baby 
 It's just more to love 
 (You still got it) 
 Oh baby, your love's crazy 
 'Cause you havin' my baby 
 (And there's so much more to love) 
 Take a look at my lady and my day began to shine 
 Told her, "Baby being beautiful is a state of mind and you are so 
 Had to let your mind and your heart know 
 As you grow, the more, the more I see God glow" 
 I know it's probably strange, seeing your body change 
 Can't fit your clothes, nose ain't the same 
 But love still remains, it won't vary with me 
 Look at you and smile, thinkin' damn she carry a me 
 A life we created, we can cherish forever 
 You growin', but it's sexy, the sex is even better 
 But through thick and thin, pickles and peanut butter 
 Is a divine mother, queen and supreme lover, you still got it 
 I know that you still got it 
 (Baby I know you still got it) 
 Don't you know that you still got it? 
 (No matter what happens baby, oh baby) 
 You still got it 
 (Baby you still) 
 Don't you know that you still got it? 
 (Baby you still the one for me) 
 Don't you know that you still got it? 
 Don't you know that you still got it? 
 (Oh baby baby)
