(Kanye West) 
 ("Make It Up") We can make it better 
 ("Make It Up") We can make it better 
 ("Make It Up") We can make it better 
 ("Make It Up") We can make it 
 Somebody told me that Delta's brownskinned, AKAs' lightskinned 
 And they supposed to be bougious, so they got white friends 
 First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein' 
 Show you what we do on weekends for a sight, man 
 She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hypeman" 
 She let a nigga hit it, and now she only date white men 
 And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightnin' but 
 (Chorus: Kanye West) 
 ("Make It Up") We can make it better 
 (Better we can) 
 ("Make It Up") We can make it better 
 (Better we can make it on up, we can) 
 ("Make It Up") We can make it better 
 (Better we can) 
 ("Make It Up") We can make it 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 The night fallin' over Brooklyn, where they murder for change 
 The converter remains faithful to the drug dealer priestess 
 He in search of the word of fame, you heard of the name 
 Kweli the truth, like I'm comin' out the mouth of bass 
 One for it, one for out the grave 
 Niggas want they reparations, How you calculate the amount to be paid 
 You try to imagine America without the slaves (the slaves) 
 (Q-Tip) 
 Her tenament yo, is rat infested 
 Her heart is like a gold booya 'cause she wouldn't protest it 
 Cause, her best friends man got popped 
 He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a glock 
 In the hood is a everyday happenin' 
 A friend of the priest say she chose out the captain 
 She yelled out "Why you do this to black men?" 
 (Common) 
 I think of eighty seven ways, to make better days 
 Whether climb or rhyme, I heard of rebel pays 
 On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades 
 Music, rhymin' good like escalates 
 In the ghetto infested by shade and drama 
 And niggas wit' things ain't afraid of karma 
 I'm thinking big like Lil Wayne in the problem set 
 (Rhymefest) 
 C'mon, Tell people the truth, but never give 'em ya true thoughts 
 Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports 
 Patriot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now 
 Johnny Cochran dead, who gonna get us free now? 
 Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now? 
 Who gon' make it better for the thugs and P's now? 
 Who gon' make it good for old folks that's senile? 
 Oh, it's good music, yeah dog I see now
