 Common: 
 I express like an interstate, hyper when I ventilate 
 My rap pieces penetrate and infiltrate your mental state 
 Just to reiterate that I innovate 
 Bonin' broads when they menestruate, I spend a great time with the rhyme 
 More than I did any female, I derailed your train of thought 
 Because your brain was caught 
 On some other man's thinking, now your third eye is blinking 
 My rhymes be kicking like a brother's breath be stinking 
 I get funky for sure while you're unsure 
 If you got beef, chief, then let that shit unthaw 
 This track was a broad, I'd be bonin' the shit out of it 
 Bang, bang, bang then see what I can get out of her 
 Probably some scratch clothes and some J's 
 I got six million ways to rhyme, choose one 
 I stand out like a nigga on a hockey team 
 I got goals, and I can like a pop machine 
 I come clean like a fiend in Chi I'm down with rehab 
 Stir my style crazy 'cause that's right, we bad, we bad 
 Pryor to Richard I was that crazy nigga 'cause I kick ass 
 And when I wreck it other rappers be like, "Whiplash"

 It's like I come to the party in a B-boy stance 
 I rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance 
 I come to the party in a B-boy stance 
 I rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance 
 Me without a lyric is like a nigga without a beeper 
 I'm a blow this shit out, 'cause I'm the joint like reefer 
 If Barry White was in the mob, I still would be deeper 
 'Cause I had lyrics back when I used to run with Keyvin 
 MC's step to me, butt-ass naked like, "What's up?" 
 I said, "You know you done fucked up 
 Now I'm sayin', "You know you done fucked up" 
 Everybody that hear me say I'm jams like the NBA 'cause I'm on fire 
 If I was a Michelin I wouldn't tire 
 It's funny how time flies, well I'm as fly as time 
 I don't believe in role models but if I do, then I'm mine 
 I make brothers say, "True," they see you and be like, "Fiction" 
 I want 'spect and dead presidents like Richard Nixon 
 I'm a coach not a player, not a gay MC, I'm straighter 
 My style is similar to AIDS, you can f with it now but catch you later 
 You can't touch this 'cause this is what I'm feelin' bro 
 I'm the man, you need me I'll be on the fifth flo', just chillin' 
 Even if it's played out it's not the word to play so peace 
 I'm out to Dirty Burgers, I'mma give my change to Reese
