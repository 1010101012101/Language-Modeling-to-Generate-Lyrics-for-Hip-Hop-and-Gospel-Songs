Will.i.am 
 Once the love was strong 
 Now it's long, long gone 
 Cause the pain, came down like a storm 
 I remained holding on 
 'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you 
 I want you, I want you 
 Common 
 I been thinkin' 'bout 
 I been thinkin' 'bout 
 I been thinkin' 'bout you lately 
 Thoughts take me to when we were close 
 Addicted to your love, feel I need another dose 
 I know it's a feeling 
 That should be long gone 
 Things seem to come up 
 When I hear our song 
 Golden brown girl, it seem so long 
 Since I heard your voice 
 Where did the king go wrong? 
 Emotions that that they linger on 
 I guess 'cause I never knew a love so strong 
 So many hot girls 
 I need your warm 
 The taste of your mouth 
 Girl, I need your warm 
 Good food and love 
 I need your warm 
 This here was made before we were born 
 A dreamer, so I'ma keep dreamin' on 
 It's kinda like the breakup of Jen and Vince Vaughn 
 Will.i.am 
 Once the love was strong 
 Now it's long, long gone 
 Cause the pain, came down like a storm 
 I remained holding on 
 'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you 
 I want you, I want you 
 Common 
 They say you don't know know know 
 What you got 
 Till what you got is gone 
 Yeah I like such and such yo alot 
 But the feelings not as strong 
 We were like two birds 
 That were able to fly 
 I try to pick the right words to say to the sky 
 Somedays I would try but wasn't able to cry 
 I never been good at sayin' goodbye 
 I take a deep breath when the times is hard 
 When I reminisce over u, my god 
 I spent many years tryna be the heartthrob 
 I guess it's only right that I got my heart robbed 
 The scent of a room that reminds me of you 
 A hint of perfume it remind me of you 
 Take a look at the moon it remind me of you 
 Hope the stars and the gods 
 Align me and you 
 Will.i.am 
 Once the love was strong 
 Now it's long, long gone 
 Cause the pain, came down like a storm 
 I remained holding on 
 'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you 
 I want you, I want you 
 'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you 
 I want you, I want you 
 Common 
 We do what we do 
 And we do what we live 
 I love this way 
 'Cause I got it as a kid 
 With so much to give from it 
 I never hid 
 The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared 
 My friends say it was a change for the better 
 But I say, girl you changed my forever 
 Relationships they can be as strange as the weather 
 Rain or sun 
 We can sang this together 
 Will.i.am 
 'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you 
 I want you, I want you 
 'Cause I want you, 'cause I want you 
 I want you, I want you
