Night Blows, Stoves don't work, Hoes at work 
 A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt 
 Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed 
 Trippin' on heights, wishin for nights in different flavors 
 The age of Kane and Big Daddy, shown by the caddies 
 Uncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me 
 My mother gave birth but she really never had me 
 Left to the hood to play daddy 
 Raised by niggaz named Butch through the bay bay 
 With waists so they weigh they status on the streets 
 License plates that say they, motto This is Chicago in the hay day 
 Similiar to Good Times, I guess that I was Jay Jay 
 A skinny nigga, young girls with penny figures 
 So many niggaz, stacked upon each other 
 It's the black upon each other that we love so much 
 Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch 
 Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much 
 Rather have some thick broads then the dutch to clutch 
 Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years 
 My college career got downed with a couple of beers 
 Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans 
 Same nigga, same block, same shit they own 
 Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome 
 In my defense, yo I had to hit that zone 
 Man to man, I'm good workin with my hands 
 My generation never understood workin for the man 
 And, of bein broke I ain't a fan 
 Now I stand in the same spot, as my old man 
 My life I planned not to be on this corner 
 I still wanna see California 
 But this is my world 
 Chorus Repeated Overlapping: 
 "It's your world" 
 [Common] Yeah 
 Life and death law around us 
 Four pounds and pounds a verb from out of towners 
 It's hard to stay grounded 
 We stay high, that's why old folks down us 
 Lost, nobody found us, the force that sorrounds us 
 Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us 
 We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures 
 Removed from earth, only to return through birth 
 Knew this girl sellin her body, wish she knew what it was worth. 
 Between God and trash, lookin' in every car that pass 
 With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggaz she was breastfed 
 She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread 
 In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads 
 Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads 
 Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt 
 She was colder (?), growin' up she got to know hurt 
 Very well in a world where self hate is overt 
 Her step-father that he was aite, so her mother he striked 
 She got to like like minded niggaz, who liked crimes and figures 
 Doin' white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her 
 In the ass, it used to be thicker 
 Life is fast, some choose to be quicker 
 I remember in high school she had a passion to sing 
 Now she see herself in a casket in dreams 
 These are the children of crack and rap, blacks done lack 
 Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream 
 On our jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme 
 In the Chi, we even rootin for a garbage team 
 This queen never seen herself on this Corner 
 She still wanna see California 
 But this is her world 
 (Chorus repeated several times) 
 (Kids stating their dreams) 
 ('POPS') 
 Be. 
 Be here, be there 
 Be that, be this 
 Be grateful for life, be grateful to life 
 Be gleeful everyday 
 For being the best swimmer among 500,000 
 Be-nign, be you 
 Be mom's mean pie 
 Be little black sambo 
 With bad hair 
 Be aware of what a lynch is 
 Be. 
 Be boundless energy! 
 Be a four star ghetto general 
 Be no one except I 
 Be food for thought to the growing mind 
 Be the author of your own horoscope 
 Be invited 
 Be long-living, be forgiving, be not forgetful 
 Be a proud run, only to return to fight another day 
 Be peaceful if possible, but justice in every ways 
 Be high when you low 
 Be on time, but knowing to go 
 Be cautious of the road to college 
 Taking a detour through Vietnam or the Middle East 
 Be visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while begging 
 A nation built on free labor for reparation 
 Be a cartopogropher [laughter] (whatever) 
 Be a map maker 
 Be able to find "Afro-American man" 
 Search thoroughly; it may be close to "black man" 
 Be amended five fifths 
 Be amended five fifths human 
 Be the owner of more land than is set aside for wildlife 
 Be Cupid, to world government 
 Be found among the truth, lost tribe 
 Be at full strength when walking through the valley 
 Be not foolish as temporary king 
 On the mountain top 
 Be a brilliant soul, sparkling in the galaxy 
 While walking on earth 
 Be loved by God 
 As much as God loved Gandhi and Martin Luther King 
 Be that last one of 144 thousand 
 Be the resident of the twelfth house 
 Be... 
 Eternal.
