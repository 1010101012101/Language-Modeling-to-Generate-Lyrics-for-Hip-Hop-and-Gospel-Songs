For his goodness 
 And for his wonderful works 
 Unto the children of men 
 If my people will lift my name tonight 
 I will come in 
 I will be exalted 
 I will be glorified 
 I will be lifted up 
 Welcome him in tonight 
 Can't you feel him? 
 Yes, yes 
 There is liberty 
 Open your heart tonight 
 Welcome him in, put them hands together 
 Fellowship 
 Joy and peace 
 All praise to the all-eye seeing... supreme-being 
 Giver of joy and peace, love supreme freedom 
 See him in the son, See him in the daughters 
 The mountains, the waters, all divine order 
 The king unseen, one dream that I had 
 I was talking to my dad 
 He said, "Things ain't as bad as they seem" 
 Is this a God dream the way Ye sing it? 
 The dream seem to go on as the day lingered 
 The meaning of life, you can't frame or name it 
 True stars remain like the name of David 
 Niggas get foreign cars and think they made it 
 It ain't yours till you create it 
 In the image of the beneficent, merciful, universal, versatile 
 My verses go till heaven and earth become reversible 
 Christ particle, so anything is possible 
 Fuck big brother, father, mother, God is watching you 
 And I want the joy, the joy 
 And I want to know the peace of mind 
 I make a way, a way to see 
 Through it all and oh 
 Living for joy and peace 
 Still in all in the night when it hurts 
 And your bed feels like snow 
 There's a joy in the rain 
 In your heart, there's a way 
 Turn your light on 
 Turn your light on 
 Turn your light on 
 Turn your light on 
 Turn your light on 
 Turn your light on 
 Turn your light on 
 Turn your light on 
 Turn your light on 
 Turn your light on
