Common - Break My Heart 
 Ooh... we you break my heart, 
 But I'll be there beside you 
 (She said "don't break my heart") 
 Ooh... we you break my heart,

 Ooh... we you break my heart, 
 But I'll be there beside you, 
 With lots of love to give you 
 (Love to give... you, you) 
 Love to give you 
 Love to give 
 (Verse One) 
 It was a dream day 
 Met her on spring break, 
 Look like the type that be like 
 "No habla engle" 
 She said you look like you rap 
 Where's your bling'e 
 And yours clothes is tight 
 But you don't seem gay 
 I said naw 
 That's dude from NSYNC'e 
 She wasn't married 
 Kept her ring on her pinky 
 She said "you know I don't be datin' rappers" 
 I said I got my SAG card, baby I'm an actor. 
 Ooh... we you break my heart, 
 But I'll be there beside you

 See her again at All Star weekend 
 She didn't have tickets 
 And she ain't into hoopers 
 She was there to kick it 
 With her roommate 
 Who was a video vixen 
 Spend so much on outfits 
 She's about to get evicted 
 Said "I'm married to this rap shit, 
 Looking for a mistress" 
 You can be by my side 
 Like flavor and deelicious 
 Long as you ain't scared of the kitchen and the dishes 
 She said "you one of them fishes, I know your mind switches", and... 
 Ooh... we you break my heart, 
 But I'll be there beside you 
 (She said "don't break my heart") 
 Ooh... we you break my heart, 
 But I'll be there beside you 
 (She said "don't break my heart") 
 Ooh... we you break my heart, 
 But I'll be there beside you, 
 With lots of love to give you (give, give it, uh) 
 (Love to give... you, you) (give, give it, yeah) 
 Love to give you (give, give it, uh) 
 Love to give (give, give it, yeah) 
 Time revolve 
 We fell in love as crazy as Nas and them 
 Broads were textin 
 'Cause I stop calling them 
 I met the parents 
 Watch the game with her father and 
 Questions of marriage 
 And I start dodging them 
 What happen to me 
 Happens to lots of men 
 Get deep in love 
 And then your needing some oxygen 
 As far as wives I was thinking like Solomon 
 She said "there you go, breakin my heart again!" 
 Ooh... we you break my heart, 
 But I'll be there beside you 
 (She said "don't break my heart") 
 Ooh... we you break my heart, 
 But I'll be there beside you 
 (She said "don't break my heart") 
 Ooh... we you break my heart, 
 But I'll be there beside you, 
 With lots of love to give you (give, give it, uh) 
 (Love to give... you, you) (give, give it, yeah) 
 Love to give you (give, give it, uh) 
 Love to give (give, give it, yeah) 
 Ooh... we you break my heart, 
 But I'll be there beside you 
 (She said "don't break my heart") 
 Ooh... we you break my heart, 
 But I'll be there beside you 
 (She said "don't break my heart") 
 Ooh... we you break my heart, 
 But I'll be there beside you, 
 With lots of love to give you (give, give it, uh) 
 (Love to give... you, you) (give, give it, yeah) 
 Love to give you (give, give it, uh) 
 Love to give (give, give it, yeah)
