 I'm a Jake, I don't bake a cake 
 I'm not a cake daddy, you know the type be pullin up in a Caddy 
 With a drop top, see when I hoe hop, I kick it to the bus stop (what?) 
 And it's goodie goodie gumdrops 
 I don't be droppin' squat but to the heads they think it's topnotch 
 I'm skippin over every other dip as if it's 
 Hop hop hop hop hop hop hop, hop, hopscotch, watch 
 Aiy aiyyo man, ay man, look at ol' girl 
 She got a BIG ass! (Yo man, sic her.) 
 Aiy man, ay... hey sweetheart, how you doin'?
