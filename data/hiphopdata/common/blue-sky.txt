Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us (x4) 
 (Listen) Why you had to hide away for (x4) 
 Aston Martin King, Luther with Dreams 
 The young Denzel the way I move through scenes 
 I'm like a preacher that once was a fiend 
 A story of change that came with wings 
 Pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eye line 
 Son of the most, so from up high I shine 
 Suited in prada, stay mellow like LaLa 
 Young fresh with dollas (dollars), ladies go gaga 
 I'm the cum lauda, top of the class 
 Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash 
 Given what I ask, pure religion and cash 
 From the windows that open, I'm raisin' my glass 
 Daylight beams, night light schemes 
 This is my inception, I'm writin' my dreams 
 Immortal view of a star doin' what I'm born to do 
 I see the blue sky, say the Lord's comin' through 
 Oh-ooh-oh, in the sky we'll find the light 
 Oh-ooh-oh, ain't too high we'll shine at night 
 Now we in the skies, blue skies 
 And we going higher, last night 
 It all started with a dream 
 I wanted to be Run DMC 
 The Lord put the blessing upon the MC 
 O to the M, dreams were spoken to him 
 That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim 
 Open my eyes, yes sir this is what I'm made for 
 To go hard in the paint, like D. Wade or 
 D. Rose from the same streets that we rose 
 International heroes at world premo's 
 Red carpet imagine taking pictures with the President 
 Told him for health care, my music is the medicine 
 My name holds weight, I am never hesitant 
 Different state resident, this is hood elegance 
 SLS classic pursuing my passion 
 Known for fashion now I'm Oscar Party crashin' 
 Immortal view of a star doin' what I'm born to do 
 I see the blue sky, say the Lord's comin' through 
 Silhouettes of dreams that we had huh 
 Even now it don't seem so bad ma 
 Close my eyes to see things in front of me 
 I'm gon' now, imagine what I'm gonna be 
 30 to worthy, now I'm all worldly 
 My broad up in Paris, looking all purty 
 Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do 
 I see the blue sky, say the Lord's coming through 
 I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere 
 I could see it from my window 
 Wouldn't take that long to get me there 
 Keep running till I can't go 
 Remember the beautiful things that life could give me 
 Crazy how I'm the one 
 Could've been anywhere, but I'm sitting in the air 
 With the wolves up staring at the sun 
 Oh, in the sky we'll find the light 
 Oh, ain't too high we'll shine at night 
 Now we in the skies, blue skies And we going higher, last night
