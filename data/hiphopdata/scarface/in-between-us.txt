Feat. Nas, T-Boz 
 (Nas) 
 Circumstances are like my first fight I lost 
 It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping 
 Oh shit, this little nigga's thugging 
 I mean, I was thirteen 
 I was nursing a knot on my face 
 But chose another time and a place 
 That I would avenge my last fight 'cause the same shit 
 Ain't gonna happen that just happened last night 
 Knuckle-game changed quicker than lighting 
 Hit 'em or slice 'em 
 Either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the fastlife 
 I tried to give another nigga advice, shoot dice 
 Do plenty of shit 'cause this life, how many you get? 
 How many niggas do you know get two? 
 Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid 
 Be one in your crew 
 I don't respect killas, I respect those with knowledge 
 Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance 
 Lessons, catch your mental to a young disciple 
 Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas do as I do 
 Keep your enemies close, where they can see you 
 It not your enemy who get you 
 It's always your own people 
 It's always your own people 
 It's always your own people 
 It's always your own people 
 It's always your own people

 Mass confusion, in my head 
 Killing me, driving me mad 
 I be wondering, can I trust my friends? 
 'Cause they stab me in my back every time they can? 
 Am I paranoid? and if that's the case 
 Is it curable? Can you help me find my place? 
 I can't handle this, I'm losing it 
 With the loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness 
 Help your brother, save him from the 
 Evil demons, in between us, came between us 
 (Scarface) 
 I know you hate me, don't you 
 I bet you sitting, wishing my time never came 
 You probably rather see me die in the game 
 You probably rather see me die in a plane 
 Well y'all see me up on top of my dough 
 I get my money shit changed 
 And niggers start looking at me different than this 
 I'm down to play the real nigger shit to get with a bitch 
 But I'ma tell a motherfucker like this 
 You going good is what you come up against 
 Nigger you get what you get 
 So the grass is greener on the other side of the fence 
 But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench 
 I'ma starter while you riding the bench 
 You saying you a player, weel I'm the one designing your prints 
 Something to go by, to let these niggers know I 
 Don't believe in letting shit slid, nigger gonna die 
 Best friends since high school seniors 
 The homeboy demeanor, but let the bullshit come between us
