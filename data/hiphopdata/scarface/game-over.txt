Too $hort 
 Man, what's up with these niggas out here 
 Mad at us 'cause we on top 
 I love to see niggas gettin' money 
 Better get it while the gettin' is good 
 Get it while you can, man 
 And stop hatin' me, fuckin' with my shit, 'cause I got more hustle than you 
 Get yours, get yours, baby 
 Dr. Dre 
 I'm seeing millions, niggaz don't understand 
 Nnow what? I'm makin' moves, puttin' cash behind plans 
 To blow up, will he style like this 
 Every day, I parlay, sip Henne and Tanqueray 
 Stay in the mix like Alezay 
 V.I.P., my shit parked valet 
 On the prowl again, to get honeys familiar with the smile again 
 Some try to assault Dre, it's still cavi 
 I'm eatin' steak while they struggle to break the slave mentality 
 I givin' livin' definition long as my hearts tickin' 
 I fought and made the world listen 
 Whatever fly Dr. Dre invented 
 Turn on the box and let my son watch these studio clowns on sixty inches 
 I push a Rover, shit platinum before the session's over 
 Rap master with the Houston heat holder 
 These playas best to get they shit in check 
 'Cause when I get my hustle on, ain't no playin' with a full deck 
 Ice Cube 
 Lord, please, murder my enemies (Yeah) 
 Burn 'em at a thousand degrees 
 And Lord, please, let me make mo cheese 
 'Cause I ain't quite ready to leave (No) 
 Lord, please, murder my enemies (Yeah) 
 Burn 'em at a thousand degrees 
 And Lord, please, let me make mo cheese 
 'Cause I ain't quite ready to leave (No) 
 Scarface 
 Buck the whole world 
 Meant that, gotta stay strapped 
 'Cause ninety-nine a niggas, carry they gats 
 Super fist fightin' shit might come down to dyin' 
 When the time comes down for the tryin' 
 I got nine reasons why niggas shouldn't step in my face with the nonsense 
 'Cause I'm always heated, and you can taste this 
 Audi little something out the seams a my trousers 
 With no hesitation, I got a team to come clown ya 
 I down ya, so let your people know what they face 
 With the type of individual that'll bomb a sub-station 
 Kaboom, and everybody dies outside 
 There ain't no escapin' the Reaper, so don't try 
 Go ahead, close ya eyes, who the next to step? 
 Face down, hit, bleedin' on the steps o' death 
 Check yo self, you just been invaded by true soldiers 
 December thirty-first, ninety-six (the game is over) 
 Ice Cube 
 Lord, please, murder my enemies (Yeah) 
 Burn 'em at a thousand degrees 
 And Lord, please, let me make mo cheese 
 'Cause I ain't quite ready to leave (No) 
 (I've got all my life to live, plus with all my love to give) 
 Dr. Dre, Scarface 
 Smokin' weed I never trail, I lead 
 Spendin' dough, tripped the cost of a ride like it was pocket money, Gs 
 But these are the things real playas do 
 Talkin' shit is real things that the hatas do 
 I'm namin' you 
 Shit's thick, it's time to run for shelter 
 I kept the word, things could happen to marks like it was helter skelter 
 Dear diary, I'm runnin' outta pages 
 Fadin', in and out, takin' purple hazes 
 The dazes, Revelations in the last stages 
 Red skies institute, the silent horns playin' 
 I'm prayin' with tears in my eyes 
 'Cause I'm tryin' to make it into eternal peace without dyin' 
 But they eyein' my bank account with beams on my Rover 
 The killa failed to launch his attack (the game is over) 
 Ice Cube 
 Lord, please, murder my enemies (Yeah) 
 Burn 'em at a thousand degrees 
 And Lord, please, let me make mo cheese 
 'Cause I ain't quite ready to leave (No)
