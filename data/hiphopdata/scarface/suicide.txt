Suicide 
 It's like basic, L? 
 Kinda basic 
 Suicide 
 I bet everybody don't like 
 What we live for ya know? 
 Drop the Norwegian 
 Dig that 
 (Scarface): 
 Took my chances but I did my dirt 
 My advice to any nigga, if you're doin' crime then you're even worse 
 Just give it up and step the fuck back 
 Cause in this game you get fame 
 You gotta start somethin' get these niggas off your nut sack 
 I'm just a nigga out the hood tryin' to have things 
 What I got upon my feet just scream the brand change 
 And your excuse is that the money came 
 Now my excuse was that you were the plain simple thing 
 I got you show my homies love though 
 I just don't fuck around with niggas that I don't know 
 And you can take it how you wanna take it 
 I'm from these motherfuckin streets 
 And the same rules apply in this game you never break it 
 My motherfuckin luck all alone at the Crap 
 And you niggas that wanna try to attack 
 You steady dyin' over some shit and me I'm steady losin my sleep 
 Cause niggas ain't familiar with the rules of the streets and it's a 
 Suicide it's a suicide 
 Suicide it's a suicide 
 It's a suicide it's a suicide 
 Suicide it's a suicide 
 (Scarface): 
 To my niggas on the streets grindin 
 I'm sitting on the sidelines 
 Too many niggas complainin pointin fingers at the problem 
 That's why I hate my baby mama 
 I'm just a nigga from the very bottom 
 Skippin class and snortin 8 balls into white powder 
 Tryin' to get in while the motherfucker gettin' good 
 The possibilities of movin out my neighborhood 
 Don't get me wrong I had them dreams too 
 But the only thing you do is get your cream fool 
 Get your motherfuckin cream fool 
 Niggas ain't no about the ins and the outs 
 First you get in then you get out 
 But you stuck in a stance 
 (Scarface): 
 Now when it's over don't nobody cry 
 Just enjoy while you live life cause everybody got to die 
 And when you see me I'll be hella 
 Been in Corners with my top down checkin' out the changes in the sky 
 Shootin paper clips at Jupiter 
 The more I love it's like I'm gettin' stupider and stupider 
 I'm tryin' to make the best over a fucked up decision 
 I'm just a nigga with a vision 
 Which is to get up and get out gettin' my profits 
 Trying to stay away from these bitches that jock dick 
 And movin up to move on you outta stay true to em 
 That's just the way you gotta do it 
 And you think it's here winning they said they don't give a fuck 
 Are you for real when you like it rough 
 Nigga what the fuck ya know what I'm sayin' is real 
 Now back the fuck up fore you get killed 'cause it's a
