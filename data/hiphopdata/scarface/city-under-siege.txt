Can't Understand my city's under siege 
 F-a-c-e-M-o-b screamin 'cause I mean it 
 Till these muthafuckas bury me 
 37-40 pull dat pistol packin 
 Gun slangin, bangin' southside 
 Heat bringer, heat slanger 
 Head banger, thought re-aranger 
 The bitch strangler, a total stranger 
 In your face with this thing aimed at ya 
 Your facin danger, 16 with one up in the chamber 
 I'm bout to stain ya, with this muthafuckin handgun 
 And fuck dem laws, dey got my brother already 
 Dey can suck my balls, average nigga have no luck at all 
 But because I be in my 'Lac chillin' 
 They stereotype me, thinkin' I'm into crack sellin 
 Man I'm windy city 2-20, anybody chin checker 
 3rd floor lake grove, 35th in leather gloves 
 With the snub nose, complex born and raised 
 And under siege every day 
 The definition, of a gaurilla 
 He is a killa, robbin for scrilla 
 Not your average every-day nigga 
 The laws at me, better off dead 'cause I ain't happy 
 Kill or be killed, Id rather go to war before they catch me 
 Arrest me, I told you before I wears vest's 
 A born legend by the way of .357 
 I'm an automatic with static its tragic Mr A-l-K-a-p-o-n-e 
 The last man standing 
 Rollin', ridin', slowly slidin 
 Creepin' up in da corners where you hoes be hidin 
 Takin' you over in ways you never even thought of 
 The city's under siege nigga don't get caught up 
 I'm a 4th ave lake street ridin' ass nigga 
 Still a ? superior executioner 
 Da bomb M-i-d-w-e-s-t mirage 
 Da killa wit? 
 (A city under siege) 
 Ghetto birds hover over southside Chicago 
 Ellis park killin' fields, gang war rival 
 Bigger than the sears tower, I was a pain in the smoke 
 They found his body floatin the lake shore 
 8 holes filled up his body full of hot ones 
 Shot one, two, three, four, down like dominoes 
 Cop killin' columbian 'nect? 
 Split, grown snitch, it's over with 
 I said a hip-hop, pour a cup of coffee 
 And then I sip and stop 
 Because we gettin' watched by some new group 
 New brood MC's walkin' round like you and me 
 But all they do is listen shit only a fool'd believe 
 275, big fat and nasty, fuck bein classy 
 I'm straight ghetto, chuckin beer bottles out da window 
 Nigga I been broke so I say fuck poppin' some Don P 
 I'm drinkin' MD 20-20 
 My city's under siege
