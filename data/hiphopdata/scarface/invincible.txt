Scarface the criminal 
 Hardcore, invincible 
 Scarface, invincible 
 The hardcore, criminal 
 Never lettin nothin' stand in the way of me ridin' 
 Animal instinct intentions whenever we grindin 
 We criminally minded, ill squeeze ya blindly 
 Body parts deteriorated when they find ya 
 Heres your death certificate, might as well sign it 
 The ending, I'm the reaper, why you hiding 
 I'm violent I strike with the force of a bomb 
 And right when you least expect it I come 
 Uh, I know you see the fire in my eyes 
 The hunger the hate I'm trapped inside now die 
 Everybody in here gotta die, ain't nobody in here escapin my nine 
 Ain't no sence in hidin, you wasting my time 
 Bitch I gotta handle I came to get mine 
 Believe if you don't leave no witness's, no crime 
 Welcome to the part of the sun that don't shine 
 Scarface invincible 
 Hardcore, criminal 
 Scarface, invincible 
 The hardcore, criminal 
 Welcome to the day of futures ak 
 The place where you get caught for shit you get sprayed 
 Where hoes got dicks and niggas is bitch made 
 Takin' penitentiary chance to get paid 
 Children gettin' suspended for totin switch blades 
 Others brutally murdered before the 6th grade 
 Its 6 million ways to murder 2face 
 I preffer the method of usin' a 12 gauge 
 And blades crack open your rib cage shawty 
 High off of wantin this weed and black mildly 
 The hardcore followin is raisin dead bodies 
 Murder inc in the muthafucka like irv gotti 
 And livin' hot as we ride, look into my bloodshot eyes 
 To visualize the blood red skies 
 It's the border where the live dead die 
 A brief moment in time, and the sun don't shine 
 Bottom line 
 Scarface invincible 
 Hardcore, criminal 
 Scarface, invincible 
 The hardcore, criminal 
 In the event that you comin' with static 
 I play the map 
 Comin' at you with M11's and automatic 
 I'm worse than the mentally ill, a bad habit 
 Over killin' my victims just to get to see they casket 
 Raised like a machine, you suckas get blasted 
 The hardcore serial killin' I done mastered 
 The church of the criminally sick, I'm the pastor 
 My dad used to beat up my mom, I'm a bastard 
 Now ask her, how does it feel to be a smasher 
 Me plus me with a strap, that's disaster 
 For anybody protectin the shit that I'm after 
 Empty wishes don't be takin' you out, I'm'a have to 
 Scarface invincible 
 Hardcore, criminal 
 Yeah, this gon be the last time I bust a new jack rap 
 Lets go back into some old shit to show y'all niggas you can't fuck with me 
 Dig it
