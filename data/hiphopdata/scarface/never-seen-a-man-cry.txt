So what you gonna do when you get outta' here cat da' 
 Face: I don't know, tryin' to live it one day at a time you know 
 (Cough, cough) I here you talkin' man, live it one day at a time it ain't nothin' but a thang tho bro' 
 Face: Yeah, I here you fool well let me get up outta here my ride out here waitin' for me 
 A'ight catty take it easy baby 
 Face: Stay up fool 
 He greets his father with his hands up 
 Rehabilitated slightly, glad to be the man's child 
 The world is different since he seen it last 
 Outta jail been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last 
 All he had was his mother's letters 
 Now he's mobile and he's gotta make a changed and make it for the better 
 But he's black so he's got one strike against him 
 And he's young plus he came up in the system 
 But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen 
 And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean 
 So he's callin' up his homie who done came up 
 Livin' lavish now they dealin' wit' the same stuff 
 And had that attitude that who he was was worth man 
 And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man 
 Now its different he done did dirt 
 And realized killin' men meant comin' up 
 But it still hurt 
 And can't nobody change this 
 It's 1994 and we up against the same shit 
 I never understood why 
 I could never see a man cry 
 Until I see a man die 
 Face: A man cry 
 Imagine life at its full peak 
 Then imagine lyin' dead in the arms of your enemy 
 Imagine peace on this earth where there's no grief 
 Imagine grief on this earth where there's no peace 
 Everybody's got a different way of endin' it 
 And when your number comes for souls then they send it in 
 Now your time has arrived for your final test 
 (I see the fear in your eyes and in your final breath) 
 How much longer will it be till it's all done? 
 Total darkness at ease be it all one 
 I watch him dying when he dies, let us celibrate 
 You took his life but your memory you'll never take 
 You'll be headed to another place 
 And the life you used to live will reflect in your momma's face 
 I still gotta' wonder why 
 I never seen a man cry 
 Until I seen a man die 
 I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong 
 But you're kinda scared of dyin' so you hold on 
 And you keep on blackin' out and your pulse is low 
 Stop tryin' to fight the reap but just relax and let it go 
 Because there's no way you can fight it but you'll still try 
 And you can try it till you fight it but you'll still die 
 Your spirit leaves your body and your mind clears 
 The rigimore starts to set now you're outta' here 
 You start your journey into outer space 
 You see yourself in the light but you still feelin' outta' place 
 So you're standin' in the tunnel of eternal life 
 And you see the ones you never learned to love in life 
 Make the choice let it go and you can back it up 
 If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up 
 But if you're ready close your eyes and we can set it free 
 There lies a man not scared to die may he rest in peace 
 I still got to wonder why 
 I never seen a man cry 
 Till I seen that man die 
 Chorus: 3x (fades out)
