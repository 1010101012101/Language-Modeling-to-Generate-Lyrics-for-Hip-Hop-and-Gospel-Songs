Man: So what you gonna when you get outta here, cat daddy? 
 Scarface: I don't know, dawg. Just trying to live it one day at a time, you know? 
 Man: I hear you talkin', man, live it one day at a time, it ain't nothin' but a thing though, bro. 
 Scarface: Yeah I hear you fool. Well let me get up outta here, man, my ride out here waitin' fo' me 
 Man: Aight, cat daddy, take it easy, baby. 
 Scarface: You stay up, fool. Peace. 
 Other man: Ay peace, Mob, stay true. 
 He greets his father with his hands out 
 Rehabilitated slightly, glad to be the man's child 
 The world is different since he's seen it last 
 Out of jail, been seven years, and he's happy that he's free at last 
 All he had was his mother's letters 
 Now he's mobile and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better 
 But he's black so he's got one strike against him 
 And he's young, plus he came up in the system 
 But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen 
 And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean 
 So he's calling up his homie who done came up 
 Livin' large, now they dealin' with the same stuff 
 And had that attitude that who he was was worth land 
 And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man 
 Now it's different, he done did dirt 
 And realized killin' men meant coming up, but it still hurt 
 And can't nobody change this 
 It's 1994, and we up against the same shit 
 I never understood why 
 I could never see a man cry till I seen a man die 
 Man cry 
 Imagine life at its full peak 
 Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy 
 Imagine peace on this earth when there's no grief 
 Imagine grief on this earth when there's no peace 
 Everybody's got a different way of endin' it 
 And when your number comes for service, then they send it in 
 Now your time has arrived for the final test 
 (I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath) 
 How much longer will it be till it's all done 
 Total darkness at ease, be it all one 
 I watch him die and when he dies, let us celebrate 
 You took his life, but your memory you'll never take 
 You'll be headed to another place 
 And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face 
 I still gotta wonder why 
 I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die 
 I hear you breathin', but your heart no longer sounds strong 
 But you kinda scared of dying, so you hold on 
 And you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low 
 Stop trying to fight the Reaper, just relax and let it go 
 Because there's no way you can fight it though you still try 
 And you can try it till you fight it, but you'll still die 
 Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears 
 The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here 
 You start your journey into outer space 
 You see yourself in the light, but you're still feeling outta place 
 So you standing in the tunnel of eternal light 
 And you see the ones you never learned to love in life 
 Make the choice, let it go, but you can back it up 
 If you ain't at peace with God, you need to patch it up 
 But if you ready, close your eyes, and we can set it free 
 There lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace 
 I still got to wonder why 
 I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
