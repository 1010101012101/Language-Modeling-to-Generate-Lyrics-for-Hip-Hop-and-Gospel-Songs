 Shit builds up, fills up 
 Too much goes overboard 
 (What the fuck am I doing?) 
 Oh lord pressure stored and exploded, unloaded 
 (What the fuck am I doing?) 
 I had to, is really to bad to 
 Went CUCKOO on that dude 
 Grab at and STAB fool's 
 (Who knew?) 
 Sad news 
 (What the fuck am I doing?) 
 I I I I I i 
 Broke, it took some time 
 Slow poke 
 I finally gave way, when under deed 
 Down flow 
 No longer stearing chosen 
 O-O-On autopilot cruisin 
 Haywire, crash, virus 
 Pull your tongue out with pliers 
 Chris benoit! 
 No longer stearing 
 Lost all control 
 Manipulation (manipualtion) 
 It won't let me go 
 The pain exploded (the pain exploded) 
 The pressure burst (the pressure burst) 
 I drop the wheel (I drop the wheel) 
 Heading for the worst 
 Heading for the worst 
 Heading for the worst 
 Heading for the worst 
 Heading for the worst 
 Your playing Tic-Tak Toe with a ticking time bomb 
 Y'all motherfuckers don't know what his mind's on 
 (Pressure) 
 Making hard as a dime on 
 Sin after sin about to get his fucking crime on 
 (Yep-Yep-Yep) 
 He was liked by the neighbors 
 This motherfucker got 31 favors 
 ("The world's best dad") 
 They say he's the greatest 
 But a drunk ass how when you see him out in vegas-s-s-s 
 He's acting rather odd 
 This motherfucker is getting sick of the facade 
 At work he's taking losses 
 And if you didn't know he's got horrible bosses 
 So what's the diagnosis? 
 When you can't sleep and you start hearing voices 
 (Voices) 
 He's got too many chores might kill his whole family 
 Might kill your's

 Strobe light 
 Let go!, hold tight 
 Wake up to this 
 Cold sight 
 You did this, this you 
 (What the fuck am I doing?) 
 You got issues! 
 What happened?, shit I'm slippin' 
 All bloody myself I'm slappin' 
 One day, all the sudden it, all became too much 
 Wasn't it? 
 Yes-s-s-s-s 
 Finally released 
 (What the fuck am I doing?) 
 Unleash the beast 
 Eject my controller 
 (What the fuck am I doing?) 
 Took me over 
 I had to 
 It's really too bad, too 
 Went CUCKOO on that dude 
 Grab that, stab, foose

 We can die tonight I don't give a fuck 
 Before I push that button I'ma blow shit up 
 Fuck the world, kill the kids 
 Fuck the court room I ain't fisting lip 
 What I'm hearing here is Satan's voice 
 Then I have slade, make a choice 
 There's blood on my hand's I can taste your pain 
 Head's so open I can pick your brain 
 Shit then change, love bizarre 
 Don't we all want to love a star 
 Well here we are, stack your pick-pick-pick-pick 
 But after this 
 I'ma stick this bitch 
 And stick this bitch! 
 And stick this bitch! 
 Never seen a man well man this is it 
 What's in my head a bizarre man now 
 At the end of the act we can all take bow 
 No longer stearing 
 Lost all control

 Because life is a open pain
