Yeah, I look all the times I fought, and look at all the times I lost, was it worth what I would sacrifice if I was shot down and died that night shake them dice nigga, you gamble when the stakes get high, when you crap you can't cont 'cause no mistakes allowed in this, stuggle, stuggles we be facing, smuggled in dope in small towns blazing, at the niggas who insisted resistance, left out sivalized but came back trippin', with nines spittin' but mine hit em, that was his wake up call lay down nigga, or die nigga, 'cause this is big boy shit, big boy crumbs to bricks move, I'm bout to take control of the block and I don't give a fuck if niggas like it or not they gone respect it 
 You niggas gone respect my mind, you niggas gone respect my g, you niggas gone respect this paper, you haters ain't fucking with me
