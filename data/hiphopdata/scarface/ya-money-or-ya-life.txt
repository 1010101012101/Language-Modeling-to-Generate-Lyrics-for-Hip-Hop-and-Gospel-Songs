One up for the hustlers and two times for the mathematics 
 Long as I can grind I'm scratching 
 Stacking cause moneys got a funny way of finding 
 Your ass this coming out your account when you start the climbing 
 And blindly got you on a major chase for paper 
 And now you got your eyes on my vault tryin' to take my paper 
 The vapors will leave niggas wit dreams to face Satan 
 I'm pacin' with infa-red beams just waiting 
 Hatin' and I don't cause the conversation 
 He spoke wit his killer but now he's got to face him 
 Racin cause off in these streets you ain't promised tomorrow 
 So if you bring pain I bring sorrow 
 I warn you ain't never been down to die slowly 
 Surely I got niggas down to die for me 
 You owe me and I want it all and that's that 
 Bitch you got to pay wit your life not scratch 
 Don't want no money 
 I want your life 
 Don't want no money 
 I want your life 
 We straight niggas roll subtractors gettin' down ain't no factor 
 We just like boys in the hood wit no actors 
 Jack you got niggas dow to come find you 
 And heat your ass up and leave your yesterdays behind you 
 Remind you a niggas definition means killa 
 If he out of paper he gots to go bring the skrilla 
 Stretch you ain't never seen drama like I can bring it 
 I'll wet you and leave you face down for no reason 
 I seen it- ain't many ways that you can change it 
 I'm dangerous society got me stamped so I'm gon' blame it 
 Aiming and if you cal canning at the planet 
 Stampin' any muther fucker left standin is stranded 
 And I want it all and that's that 
 Bitch you got to play wit your life not scratch
