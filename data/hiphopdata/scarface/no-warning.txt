It's the return of the real nigga wit real shit 
 And when the smoke dies down its still a nigga left to deal wit 
 This mutha fucker standin one deep solo 
 Exercising parts of the game but don't know 
 I bring it to a mutha fucker full throttle 
 And any mutha fucker want pain I brought the full bottle 
 Now take ya two of these and call me in the morning 
 Three times point blank range wit no warning 
 Nigga I'm straight killa slash for show drama 
 And every mutha fucker involved gon' face drama 
 Punk I ain't no mutha fucka rappin' in song 
 You bust your caps when you rap 
 But I bust back at your dome bitch 
 And this is always all day killa 
 And bitches who be stressin me out I get rid of 
 I'm still a guerilla in these goddamn streets 
 Walkin' up on mutha fuckers and leavin' 'em sleep 
 ('Cause if you gonna ride then we can ride) 
 But 99.9 of the times you gon' die 
 (Die mutha fucker die mutha fucker die) 
 Mutha fuckers crowdin my space they gon' die 
 I can't believe you hoes is playin' wit this 
 But since you mutha fuckers want drama I'll bring you this shit 
 I got my dime down cocked and shined 
 Just a homie from the hood 
 Had the paper still I'm bout to grind 
 What you thought this was nigga some studio gimmick 
 A mutha fucker talking that shit but couldn't spend it-shit 
 I come around this mutha fucker bending beads 
 And dare one of you hoes to come and fuck wit me 
 I'm real with it I'll warn you mutha fuckers again 
 That if you step to me wit ho shit I'm turning you in 
 Shocked-and shot wit five holes in your memory 
 And when you headed for hell you gon' remember me 
 The one MC who told you niggas once 
 And after that he gave no warning he straight done him- punk 
 I got my mind all made up to go off 
 When bitches start to threaten my life I go off 
 Take a walk on the wild side 
 And all the coloreds go whoop whoop 
 When I come down in my coupe 
 And mutha fuckers hatin' me come give it a try 
 But 99.9 of the times you gon' die 
 Wit no warnin 
 Dealing wit the killer wit the strap out 
 No warnin -then 
 All fo a sudden homie blacks out 
 Wit no warnin 
 And now your dealing with your outer body energy 
 All the pain you left in your life you still feeling me 
 Everybody living must have thought it would change 
 But living fast and dying young's a part of the game 
 How can one spit the game so sure 
 Turned around and emptied his than 
 Wit no warning
