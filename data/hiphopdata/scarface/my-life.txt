(Intro: Scarface talking) 
 Ooh, yo Vice drop this heat dog, ugh 
 Hit the bass line, yo Vice what you're doin' man 
 Straight up, ugh 
 (Verse 1: Scarface) 
 I'm too deep to quit, and too strick to fold 
 And you need to split nigga G into code 
 Come on, these years to teach, homey speak to know it 
 Bodybag what we're talkin' about, you weak, you row 
 The game is overcrowded so we fight for space 
 Neighbourhood show the hustle, still we grind to win 
 Tryin' to find a way, to come up on 2 pounds of yay 
 And double up it, ain't never happened touch it 
 A lot of niggaz focued on they candy paints 
 And that was in the grills, steering wheels and grand 
 But I ain't trippin' out here, flippin' I just need to thank 
 Money miny, yo all the mission tryin' to steal me bank 
 Ride and homicides we get it, fuck it, peepin' in horn 
 Killin' all these pussy niggaz think they keepin' in God 
 Pistol cocked on the block and all they fearin' is death 
 Then again nigga, roaddog you feelin' me yet 
 So if I die, I'm tryin' to get it mamma, barely deed 
 And pray to God that he kept this spot hell me 
 Sad as fuck, what the nigga stuck down the raw 
 Bust friends, back in the prison, foundin' rock to the troupe 
 Here I smoke and tryin' to hide it but was played by the rule 
 And if live like the gold fiend then you'd do what they do 
 I'm on my own limits sold buck words 
 All alone in the ghetto, deep in weed, sweat in Jelly Nose 
 Worrey eyes, you either do it or you die 
 Crimin' in flood, ridin' your blood, cause this is your life... 
 (Chorus: Johnny P) 
 Our golden law, now foes or friends 
 I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends 
 I been smillin' but I can't innovate 
 I feel that hurt but I can't explain it 
 I have been around with a player or two 
 And still ??Hurricane can be, ?? 
 ?? Loose when you pumped the face 
 Real nigga blues and it hold your aims 
 You're bold or fold no in betweens 
 Console your seems don't blow your creams 
 Also don't you loose your dreams 
 This is my life, this is my life 
 (Verse 2: Willie D) 
 I just got word: my uncle done died 
 But ain't no tears on my face 'cause I done already cried 
 I been here before, dead to me is not new 
 My heart safe it, mamma don't, cops too 
 I got my best to get my purpose to the Lord 
 But sometimes this shit be fuckin' with me hard 
 And I'm heartless, I'm a kid again 
 Lookin' out my window watchin' niggaz get murdered 
 In college worked the parties, step with??, drink ?? 
 Just to get through the night 
 Go to school only the anchor stomach givin' you fight 
 Cause sure there were fights and I was bustin' like a the sun bitch 
 The smartest nigga on the block live in ??kick 
 The convicts with worry ?? hard to ?? to the tails 
 Searchin' for heaven and livin' in hell 
 They say I'm wrong for teaches this on 
 Fuck what you believe, can't heal by myself 
 That's the way I'm livin', this is my life 
 (Chorus: Johnny P) 
 Our golden law, now foes or friends 
 I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends 
 I been smillin' but I can't innovate 
 I feel that hurt but I can't explain it 
 I have been around with a player or two 
 And still ??Hurricane can be, ?? 
 ?? Loose when you pumped the face 
 Real nigga blues and it hold your aims 
 You're bold or fold no in betweens 
 Console your seems don't blow your creams 
 Also don't you loose your dreams 
 This is my life, this is my life 
 (Verse 3: Bushwick Bill) 
 I only got one eye but I see things ever so clear 
 Been acquainted with death but I never know fear 
 I still roll to spots, cats scared to go there 
 If it's a heaven for a G, if not, prepare to go there 
 I live for today and not promise tomorrow 
 Smoke weed and set lead and try to dry my sorrows 
 In this game of life ain't no rules to follow 
 And if I come to lie for them it's a hard heal to swallow 
 I'm still the smallest cat with the biggest rep in H-Town 
 Stress in my life is gettin' hard to take down 
 Havin' visions of cats rollin' in my weight now 
 It feels like I'm about to have a nervous break down 
 It takes a big man to share this pride 
 Tryin' to get my soul right and put the brain inside 
 Y'all niggaz are so scared to ride 
 They got it from Still I alive to Why I Feel So bad inside 
 This is my life... 
 (Chorus: Johnny P) 
 Our golden law, now foes or friends 
 I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends 
 I been smillin' but I can't innovate 
 I feel that hurt but I can't explain it 
 I have been around with a player or two 
 And still ??Hurricane can be, ?? 
 ?? Loose when you pumped the face 
 Real nigga blues and it hold your aims 
 You're bold or fold no in betweens 
 Console your seems don't blow your creams 
 Also don't you loose your dreams 
 This is my life, this is my life
