Now the funeral is over, 
 And all the tears are dried up, 
 Niggas hangin' deep on the cut gettin' fired up, 
 Lookin' for the nigga who pulled a pistol on my homie, 
 An eye for an eye so now your life is what you owe me 
 Look deep into the eyes of your motherf*ckin' killer, 
 I want you to witness your motherfuckin' murder nigga 
 And since you wants to kill then your ass is gots to fry 
 But ain't no police therefore your ass has gots to die 
 We play the game for keeps 
 And if you slip I guess you sleep 
 You shoutin out 'fuck it' now your ass is six feet deep 
 'Cause where I come from yo everybody's got a gat 
 And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at 
 And if your shit is flimsy then your ass is gonna bend 
 And like I said before they'll be no tears in the end 
 I'm rollin' through your hood and now my heart is full of anger 
 You're at your sister's house now your sister's life's in danger 
 (By a total stranger) 
 With the kegger 
 Niggas wanna bang ya 
 And hang ya 
 Stang ya with one up in the chain 
 Lets take a trip up Hollywood 
 See how many niggas in my hood 
 Is down to die today 
 We standin up for our own shit 
 And if you outside the clique then you die bitch 
 It ain't no love in this motherfucker 
 It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother 
 Because we real with this shit so we stay true 
 And since we bang then we do what OG say do 
 I've got the mind of the man in the mirror 
 So I'm lookin' at me vaguely 
 But I can't seem to faze me 
 I've got my pistol point cocked 
 Ready ta lay shots non stop until I see your monkey ass drop 
 And let your homies know who done it 
 'Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit you mother fuckers know who run it 
 So when you put this motherfucker to the test 
 You have to realize somethin' nigga - you're fuckin' with the very best 
 I've got this killer up inside of me 
 I can't talk to my mother so I talk to my diary 
 I goin' off on the deep end 
 I find myself face to face with myself while I'm sleeping 
 I see your picture in my head and my hands shake 
 You can run you can hide but there's no escape 
 My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy 
 I got to get this motherfucker 'fore he gets to me 
 So in your own blood you'll bathe 
 And I won't stop until I put this motherfucker in his fuckin' grave 
 And I can say this once again 
 You can cry but you'll still die 
 There'll be no tears in the end.
