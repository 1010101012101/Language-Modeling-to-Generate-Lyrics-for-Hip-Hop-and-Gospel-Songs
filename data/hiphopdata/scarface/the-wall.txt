So Brad, tell me what's going on in your world? 
 Verse one: 
 Its fucked up, I'm looking at myself in the mirror 
 I'm seein' something scary, its slowly coming clearer 
 I had a funny feeling that today will be the day 
 That someone tries to blow my motherfucking ass away, but hey 
 I'm running out of time to be blunt 
 I never had the nuts to make the motherfucking final cut 
 I've been depressed for no fucking reason 
 But every problem's got a reason; I'm kinda havin' trouble breathin' 
 Somebody help me, hear my plead, my battle cry 
 My psychic told my that it's gonna be hard for Brad to die 
 She told a lie, I think I oughtta shank the bitch 
 I got my pistol, thinking if I should shoot the shit 
 Click, bang, I jammed it, I slammed it 
 Aw shit, goddammit 
 I'm havin' a fucked day to begin with 
 I lost a bitch, a bird, and then this 
 My homies tend to think I get too high 
 I'm doing fine, now pass me the formaldahyde 
 The only thing that seems to help me cope 
 Is when I'm drunker than a motherfucker puffin' on the chronic smoke 
 And then I'm able to deal with the woes 
 The friends, the foes, the bitches, the hoes 
 I gotta gang of niggers, but none of them I'd fuck 
 I gotta gang of bitches, but none of them I'd trust 
 Trust a bitch, nope, uh-uh, never 
 I'm havin' too much trouble tryin' to keep my damn self together 
 They got me by the balls 
 So please, help me break these motherfucking... 
 (Pause) 
 These motherfucking walls 
 Verse two: 
 I scream, there's no one there to hear me cry 
 I guess its hard to scream to motherfuckers when you scream inside 
 I see my future and its coming in in plain view 
 I blame myself, but mommy dear I blame you 
 Cause the world was fucked from the first 
 And havin' me only made the matters worse 
 Now look at what they did to me 
 That's some fucked up shit for a kid to see 
 Motherfuckin' dealin' after dealin', killin' after killin' 
 I'm tryin' to check a million 
 The world's going straight to fuckin' Satan 
 A fucking shank's about to blow my fuckin' brain 
 Verse three: 
 Shit, damn I'm dead 
 I'm finally through hearing all these voices in my head 
 Somebody finally got me 
 I'm looking at my self outside of my fucking body 
 So now I'm standing face to face 
 Mr. Scarface, versus Mr. Scarface 
 We were two different people from the start 
 One nigga's too smart the other too fucking hard 
 We both refused to be outsmarted 
 Dearly departed, the battle's already started 
 Fuck it, its on, I duck, I weave, connect, oh shit, I'm struck 
 Caugt me with the peircing lead 
 And realized to myself I shot my own fucking self 
 Damn, suicide is quicker 
 I try to break the wall the wall keeps getting thicker 
 I really start to miss my mother 
 I try to climb the wall, its higher than a motherfucker 
 I wondering what that sound is 
 I'm having major trouble trying to walk around it 
 There ain't no getting up I'm trapped 
 I really should've dropped my motherfucking strap 
 'Cause when I think about it now 
 I shouldn't have tried to climb the motherfucker 
 (Pause) 
 I should've broke the motherfucker down
