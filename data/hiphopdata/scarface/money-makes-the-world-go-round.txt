Scarface: 
 Money makes the world go round 
 Money makes me do all things I do 
 Hang with my homies smoke weed drink brew 
 Ride down Belford one deep and ?? crew 
 And money makes the world go round 
 Money makes the world go round 
 Living in a mansion one day with my wife 
 Stack me up some papers these days one night 
 If wind stop blowing these days than my sight 
 Winds start blowing I'm paid trump tight 
 Got to have papers these days in my life 
 I got to have paper these days of my life 
 Chorus: Repeat 6X
