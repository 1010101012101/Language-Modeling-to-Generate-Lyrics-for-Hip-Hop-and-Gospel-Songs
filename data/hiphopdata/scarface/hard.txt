The streets lights are glowing, everyday's another struggle 
 The moon is slowly and silent staring make it so my hustle is antite 
 The city streets is hectic gotta get it 
 Here the mall, ain't a promise to me 
 So I don't live and feel working till I touch it, stack it until I need it 
 I spend it on what I want, reup and that's when I need 
 It's over you never see me, it's being salt as it's lesser 
 The niggas straight out the gutta, murder without a question 
 Bodies in my surroundings, clickclack from downing 
 All they know is he missing when niggas ain't never found him 
 Assaulting is the least, I don't live it on rejects 
 I'm a muthafuckin' killer foreal with the same threat 
 I'm as gangsta as it gets and my advice for you is lay your life 
 Ya never know when niggas might hit you in the city lights 
 Get it right, ya never know when niggas might hit you in the city lights 
 Get it right (get it right) 
 Born and raised on the north blocks, home of the hard knocks 
 Wanna get rich, find a spot to pump that hard out 
 Might get robbed and shot if niggas don't think you worthy 
 In my hood, I saw a lot of gangstas die early 
 Mama heart broke, and brother feel like he gotta fix it 
 So he loading up from straps, bout to hit it where they kick it 
 Got a first class ticket to the pen 
 Seventeen years old but up in that they all men 
 It's just another day, one come out, another go in 
 It's hard out here, you can't even trust yo friends 
 They'll have a nigga set up, whatever by the curb 
 It's every man for self, oh you ain't heard 
 I'm a muthafuckin' hog, survive through it all 
 Stand up tall, we don't fall, naw 
 I been shot at but ain't been shot 
 Been in plenty fight but ain't been drop 
 Always came out on top like a hardknock 
 Straight up 
 Yeah, these tattoo tears cover my face 
 My momma got mad at first but shit she know she may 
 I'm a g you gotta pray for me, it is what it is 
 Why these niggas out here playing, mayne this really my fear? 
 What'cha know about them late nights, no lights and no food? 
 No diapers for the baby's, the house smell like booboo 
 Think of what'chu would do what I tell ya what I does 
 Walk straight up off the porch, now the camus begun 
 My big brother on lock, so I starve his gut 
 He goin' lead to where he at, I been in the going stuff for crack and that 
 Big homie knew I had it on my mind 
 He ain't like it but it right that run it through my bloodline 
 He knew what he decline and what goin' be hard for me to find 
 So he choose to put me down, and I got up on my grind 
 The dawg and you hoes say I'm glorifying crack 
 My momma lights off, the whole house pitch black, bitch! 
 Straight up
