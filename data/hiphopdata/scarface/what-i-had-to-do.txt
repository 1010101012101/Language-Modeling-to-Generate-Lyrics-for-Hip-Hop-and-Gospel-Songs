Yea, I grew up like the rag of the dark, so what? 
 Soldier, proud about it, that's just what I gotta do

 Soldier, proud about it, that's just what I gotta do 
 Peace to my street niggas 
 My hand in hand dudes 
 That follow man rules 
 And give out samples 
 Yea, see I was you 10 years ago 
 But bloodshed, time served many years ago 
 Brown skin but I could mix with a Spanish group (why?) 
 I'm half of that, so half of that you can't recoup 
 You can't find nothing to live for 
 You should find something to die for, therefore 
 You should never hang around thieves 
 'Cause you are who you hang with 
 Like trees to the leaves 
 I used to sell dope to the dope fiends 
 And crack to the crack heads by all means 
 Hustling, getting money was a part of me 
 Right through my blood, like some veins and the arteries 
 Apparently, the streets for the love wanna marry me 
 Down the alley, carry me

 Yea, I got the dope man blues 
 Still out here playin' dope man dudes 
 So come and take a walk off in my dope man shoes 
 So I can show you motherfuckers how the dope man do 
 Got niggas I've been down with deep 
 What I say that they down, don't sleep 
 Ask you got bloodstained hands, for my homeboys I lost to this fucked up plan 
 Goddamn, I think if I had one last wish 
 I want rance up out this shit 
 And resurrect the ones run down, in the streets gunned down, 
 Put the slick one round now 
 Imagine your cocaine sold out 
 You get reckless and get your brains blown out 
 Street life's so deep and we might not eat 
 A dead man won't speak and revenge is so sweet 
 Yea, I grew up like the rag of the dark, so what? 
 Soldier, proud about it, that's just what I gotta do
