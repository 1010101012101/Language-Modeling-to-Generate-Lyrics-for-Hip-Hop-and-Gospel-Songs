(Scarface) 
 Ghetto niggaz remain violent all the killers remain silent 
 Niggaz strapped with 45's and ain't smiling 
 And I'm driving to a place they're all rome' 
 The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home 
 In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real 
 We focused on the dollar bill, still 
 The outsiders tend to disrespect the place 
 Where niggaz do their struggling die with a straight face 
 Surviving, under conditions demons dinin' 
 You can run it but can't hide it so step aside 
 It's the nigga that makin' music for the streets 
 'Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets, 
 Cause its deep 
 Some niggaz make it out the neighborhood and won't circle 
 And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose? 
 A motherfucker sitting on fat 
 Who done came up in the hood but he can't come back 
 Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame 
 On a mission to maintian me and take aim 
 In position to let my opposition know my life 
 Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right? 
 Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper 
 I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper 
 Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me 
 Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer 
 Enter the ghetto so that you can see 
 What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me 
 Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange 
 And talking 'bout a motherfucking change 
 This is for my thug niggaz 
 This is for my homies and my thug niggaz (uuuuugh) 
 (Master P) 
 'Face, imagine us working at McDonald's 
 And me and you selling fucking tapes in the Bahamas 
 Gold slug, a car full of thug niggaz 
 Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers 
 No Limit soldiers to the fullest 
 See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh 
 Real ghetto niggaz can't be stopped 
 Got me mixing up dope with little J down at Rap-A-Lot 
 My phone tapped the feds on my tail 
 Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build 
 True to the ghetto that's my life 
 You see that house on the lake its for the kids and the wife 
 You can test me if you wanna 
 'Cause I be dumping niggaz off from New Orleans to California 
 Rowdy like a hurricane (uuuuuugh) 
 Independant, black owned got them hooked on this cocaine 
 You used to see C.E.O.'s in a suit and tie 
 But we young niggaz in tennis shoes and diamonds 
 Executive street millionaires 
 Niggas gonna be 'bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair 
 (Doracell) 
 It's alive, and I'mma be tha muhfuckin' one 
 Make these niggas want some 
 Here I come 
 Da Last Don 
 Niggaz steady claiming this 
 Tatted on my wrist since 86 
 What tha fuck? 
 I'm sitting in my cell block stuck 
 Listening to this shit my radio did 
 Shit, gotta change the situation 
 Write a letta to the warden mothafuck all this time wasting 
 Chasin' niggas wit my occupation 
 Clean across the nation 
 Lookin' for two-facin 
 The gangsta, the killa, and the dope-dealer all in one 
 Now past me my muthafuckin' gun 
 Niggaz feelin' they invinsible 
 Till they dealin' wit tha muthafuckin' principle 
 Doracell nigga 
 I ain't scared cause 2 pac got kilt 
 I'm on tilt 
 Feelin' the muthafuckin' guilt 
 Thug Nigga
