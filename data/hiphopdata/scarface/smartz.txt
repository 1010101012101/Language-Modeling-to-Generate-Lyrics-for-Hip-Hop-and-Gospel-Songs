(VERSE 1: Scarface) 
 It's been a long time comin' 
 But now I'm back up in this bitch to hit these niggas with this gangsta shit 
 I keep the strong rhymes runnin' 
 My shit don't switch, I'm 10 years in, and ain't changed one bit 
 It's all about the real, nigga 
 I keeps it real, nigga 
 And won't sell out for ??? with Tommy Hilfiger 
 Fucker, I figure niggas wanna see 
 The side of society they don't see on TV 
 So when I bring the shit, I bring the shit like I seen it 
 And when I scream the shit, I sing the shit like I mean it 
 No secret, these muthafuckas figure I'm a threat 
 'Cause I ain't fallin' short to the traps the demon set 
 Now sweat, cause now I got my head in your books 
 And when I think 'cracker', my definition read 'crook' 
 Now look, we're livin' under laws that they set 
 Back then we were treated like dogs and wasn't shit 
 And slowly but surely the shit changed 
 >From they fault, but if you black, then you get blamed 
 A damn shame, that means this muthafucka's one-sided 
 And blacks, we get lost in the sauce, because we unguided 
 These muthafuckas had a plan from the start 
 Get what they can get and rip they assholes apart 
 They smart 
 (CHORUS: Devin / (Tony 'Scarface' Montana)) 
 They smart, man 
 (Those guys...) 
 You niggas better watch yo ass 
 (..They're the bad guys) 
 Them bastards they smart, man 
 (Those guys...) 
 It's up to us for how long we gon' last 
 (..They're the bad guys)
