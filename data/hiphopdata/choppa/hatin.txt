Hype/Money: 
 Man watchu watchu think about that Choppa cat brotha? 
 Man shit what the fuck is a aul anyway? 
 Ain't nobody talked about the west bank in like ten years, you da first one 
 What tha fuck is a wild west biggidy anyway? 
 I wish somebody let me know, the nigga be talkin' bout some crazy shit 
 What tha fuck he talkin' bout he said his name like 300 times in one fuckin' song, Choppa style Chop Chop Choppa style, what is that he ain't sayin' nothin' 
 All I know is his name, I know it real well, I don't even know his face 
 What the fuck is... 
 Choppa: 
 Just because I got me a deal, doesn't mean I gotta big head 
 Can't hook up wit my people and chill 
 Ima' rap till I'm blue in tha face, and keep my money and my fans 
 Understand Ima' do what it takes, I never was fake 
 Everthang I'm spittin' is real, I was hungry I was hustlin 
 So I'm gettin' a deal, flippin my skills, flippin this deal 
 Whatever it takes I'll put a hater in tha dirt 
 And hit the verse that's waitin, ya I learned that from Kim 
 When they had tha streets blocked, they had tha heat that made you fade away 
 Like a police squad, they even had little guns soundin like grease pops 
 And so much candy you would think it was sweet shops 
 Now I gone an done shows with Jigga, smoked with Juvey, hooked up wit Ja Rule 
 And felt some booty, had hoes claimin that they wanted to school me 
 I'm bout my money, not bout what them bitches out ta do me 
 'Cause I'm in this to win this, so gimme your mic 
 Ima spin this and send this and betchu you like, ya, Ima' break 'em off propa propa, man fuck tha nigga hatin' on Choppa Choppa c'mon. 
 Hype/Money:

 Then I go check out tha show, he slingin his winkey tha whole show 
 (Bang bang) I don't wanna see his winky I wanna see what he's talkin' bout. 
 Choppa: 
 Niggas goin' off with a nigga and told ya 
 But I got 50 niggas who willin' ta show ya, I ain't even talkin' bout guns 
 Lemme blow ya, I got niggas down from the Mararo to tha Magnolia 
 YA Now these niggas gettin' line, like they had scholeosis 
 And I was bout ta fix they spine and I'll I do is spit these rhymes 
 I don't aim at tha bulls-eye, but I seem ta hit each time 
 And I heard that fake shit that you said in your soul 
 Let a nigga make money bitch leave me alone, all that hatin' and reppin' on Choppa Chop, can't get mad just because a nigga hot you not 
 And you niggas keep on sayin' I'm wack, but every time I see ya pops at tha corner he's always given me gaps said,(I wish my son could rap that way) 
 And I write my own rhymes, that's Juh Juh Juh Juh J-M-K.
