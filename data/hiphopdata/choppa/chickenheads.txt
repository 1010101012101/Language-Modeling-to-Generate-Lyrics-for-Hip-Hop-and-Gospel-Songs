 Now these chicken head hoes see platinum thick as white gold 
 Se the 20 inch Pirelli's roll mane thank the vogues 
 Dodgin all my foes 
 Ridin' Cady truck wit DVD 
 A flock 
 Of broads follows me 
 From the club to break they knees 
 Knowin' that's all I want 
 Straight out tha club 
 Tha rest ain't smellin right 
 The last thangon they mind is freshin up 
 Its goin' down tonight 
 Weave in they head 
 Weed in they purse 
 Still crunk 
 Baby seats all across the back wit close in the trunk 
 (Juicy j) 
 I been known to hold my own 
 I been known to ride on chrome 
 I been known to flip a platinum watch wit the diamond stones 
 I'm the fool supplyin tha dro 
 I'm tha fool supplyin tha blow

 Tellin' me that you diggin me

 Get yo rags and work that streets 
 Pay ya boy and make me rich

 Cashin it from all you chicks
