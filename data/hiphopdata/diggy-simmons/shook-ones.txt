They hip hop was gone, than everybody moaned 
 I'ma pick it up where it left off and respawn 
 It's like being reborn, eat the crack, drink wine 
 For those that can't see it, I give sight to the blind 
 Call it audio abuse I take it each time 
 That's why a lot of these rappers on a rapid decline 
 I'm on my Master P grind no time to be a Romeo 
 I love the ladies but success is a lonely road 
 As I hold, I'm what half of y'all ain't 
 I got Micky D pockets and Caviar tastes 
 Does it matter, y'all tatted on half of y'all face 
 To appeal to look real when half of y'all fake 
 Faker than a 1000 dollar bills with Obama face on it 
 You rappers don't want it, I'm on it 
 My competition gon get shut down like the Source 
 This is entrepreneur music, I'm a young boss 
 All I do is floss all the way across the nation 
 Not only in New York but wherever I vacating 
 Never really taken days off, paper chasing 
 Shows stay packed and venues is never vacant 
 Lyrically I'm a menace, call me old dog 
 Put all of these rappers careers in the morgue 
 Ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm just so appalled at the way these n-ggas rapping 
 Now I know I can cruch 'em all 
 I'm a young icon in the making, destined for greatness 
 Now watch these rappers start hating 
 When I'm around nobody matter, 
 Man, I'm there mother, there girl and there daughters favorite rapper 
 Make way for the youth, I got the medicine man 
 Diggy looking like he the truth 
 Yeah I'm motion picture, my life is a movie, I do this 
 For New York City, Queens Salute me.
