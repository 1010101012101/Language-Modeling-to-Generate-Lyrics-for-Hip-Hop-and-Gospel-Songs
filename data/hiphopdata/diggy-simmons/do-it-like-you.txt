Oh, hey, there she go 
 That's the one I've got to know 
 Such a cutie right? 
 Her whole crew is tight 
 But they don't do it like you 
 How her hair flows when she walk 
 Like a Love Jones when she talk 
 Such a cutie right? Her whole crew is tight 
 But they don't do it like you 
 It seems like for a while I've know ya 
 Nostalgic moments feels like magic don't it 
 Girl you killin' 'em, my condolence 
 That's how you on it? Yeah that's how you on it 
 And I'm gonna be with you 
 No matter what it takes 
 Running with scissors in the traffic 
 Tryna cut straight to the chase 
 Wanna be there when you wake 
 When no make up on your face 
 Not even gloss, before you brush 
 Love your dimples when you blush 
 It's the simple things in life we take for granted 'cause we rush 
 I just wanna gain your trust as well as me giving you mine 
 What's yo sign? I'm a Aries, I'm a 90's baby clearly 
 I'll make sure to make time for you though my schedule may vary 
 Hold up, hold up, hold up I just wanna know ya 
 I heard 'em say that beauty's in the eyes of the beholder 
 Well girl my vision's bad so I'm gon' need you to come closer 
 Closer, now you right here where you suppose to 
 Oh, hey, there she go 
 That's the one I've got to know 
 Such a cutie right? 
 Her whole crew is tight 
 But they don't do it like you 
 How her hair flows when she walk 
 Like a Love Jones when she talk 
 Such a cutie right? Her whole crew is tight 
 But they don't do it like you 
 Excuse me Misses, may I spark your interest 
 Cause you sure got my attention, I just wanna grant you wishes 
 (La, la) 
 What you want you get it, I don't call it tricking 
 Not just 'cause I got it 'cause I want to, that makes all the difference 
 I'm about my business, and ooh girl you the business 
 We should get together soon so we can do some business 
 I got some things that I could teach ya, lemme show ya 
 Is you ready, what's the hold up 
 You ain't 'bout no drama, you remind me of my mama 
 Smelling like flower balm and Escada 
 Shut it down and you won't even try ta 
 You such a boss but carry yourself like a lady 
 The baddest out ya crew and that is not up for debating 
 Hold up, hold up, hold up I know what they say 
 Every rapper only want that sexual healing Marvin Gaye 
 Don't believe it girl, I promise I'ma treat you like my treasure 
 I'm a movement by myself but I know you'll make me better 
 Oh, hey, there she go 
 That's the one I've got to know 
 Such a cutie right? 
 Her whole crew is tight 
 But they don't do it like you 
 How her hair flows when she walk 
 Like a Love Jones when she talk 
 Such a cutie right? Her whole crew is tight 
 But they don't do it like you 
 Oh, hey, there she go 
 That's the one I've got to know 
 Such a cutie right? Her whole crew is tight 
 But they don't do it like you 
 How her hair flows when she walk 
 Like a Love Jones when she talk 
 Such a cutie right? Her whole crew is tight 
 But they don't do it like you 
 Hey, her hair flows when she walk 
 Like a Love Jones when she talk 
 Such a cutie right? Her whole crew is tight 
 But they don't do it like you 
 They don't do it like you 
 The cutest girl I've ever seen by the way 
 Yeah, yeah
