Yeah, I'm ready, yeah 
 They wan't me to fall 
 They wanna see if I make it 
 Got my back against the wall, put my head to the sky 
 No, I won't let'em break me 
 I got great expectations 
 Great expectations 
 (I'm ready) 
 All the stares 
 And all the glares 
 They waitin' on him 
 And all the weight 
 From all the hate 
 It's gainin' on him 
 The intensity as he rises 
 As nobody can disguise it 
 It's like he got fire in his eyelids 
 The crowd is roarin' 
 It's so enormous, his blood is boilin' 
 His head is burnin', he's focus 
 He wishes they ignore 'em 
 Who in they right mind 
 Want to let his light shine 
 He ain't even in his prime 
 Pressure of a lifetime 
 He standing steady, hands sweaty 
 Maybe nervous, but ready 
 The skepticism lies heavy 
 He's bout to make it ready 
 He got his fam on his back 
 Bout to carry like Chevy 
 So much on his plate 
 He hopes the repercussions ain't deadly 
 But he ain't gonna back out 
 For what he faces right now 
 And he knows that he will outstand every 
 Doubt and turn around 
 The inceptions are knocked out 
 They are no longer will be doubt 
 There's a rumor he won't stop till his name is what they shout 
 They wan't me to fall 
 They wanna see if I make it 
 Got my back against the wall, put my head to the sky 
 No, I won't let'em break me 
 I got great expectations 
 Great expectations 
 (I'm ready) 
 He's no longer fearing 
 That's why the past persevering 
 The way he's staring is clearing 
 All that could be competition 
 Immediate intuition is winnin' 
 He's never slippin' 
 Been hearin' them sayin' that he could be the best that ever did it 
 Their expectations lie high 
 So he's just prayin' 
 Can I be the best man I could ever be to exceed everything they want me to be 
 No anxiety, just gonna do me and always proceed for the ones that believe 
 For the young man that's dedicated with a potential to achieve 
 So I'ma keep goin', keep flowin', keep knowin' 
 I'm the dopiest 
 My rhymes are potent 
 But I'ma need you to know it 
 I know where I came from but I stay so hungry and focused 
 Like I was focusin and wasn't million in one of the closest 
 Great expectations I got 'em waiting and anticipatin 
 They only hatin' you know they will be stayin' 
 I'm returnin' to be one of the greatest 
 So if you hate it take it 'cause I won't stop and you wanna make it 
 They wan't me to fall 
 They wanna see if I make it 
 Got my back against the wall, put my head to the sky 
 No, I won't let'em break me 
 I got great expectations 
 Great expectations 
 (I'm ready, I'm ready) 
 Staring in the heaven with my headphones on 
 I can see it in my eyes and know 
 That I'm the one they have been waiting for 
 I know my dreams are waiting for me 
 And looking down ain't the way to go, no 
 Not till they're screamin' my name, yeah [x2] 
 I ain't gonna give up the game, yeah [x3] 
 I tell 'em screamin' my name, yeah [x2] 
 I ain't gonna give up the game [x3]
