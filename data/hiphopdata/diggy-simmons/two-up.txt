Two up, for this great life, if it feels right 
 Go ahead put it up, everybody live it up 
 If tomorrow never comes, 
 Two up, for this great life, if it feels right 
 Go ahead put it up, everybody live it up 
 If tomorrow never comes, 
 I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, now keep it right 
 I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, 
 I'm feeling good, rather I'm feeling great 
 The game got me feeling over I don't feel the aches 
 I'm tryina eat, you tryina steal my plate 
 All the hate, throw it out the front door, fill the [?] 
 I know I can, but you feel I can't 
 You think my hype is all gas but you fill my tank 
 How you fuel me with what you cruelty 
 And I'm a beast, don't know [?] the beauty 
 I'm illmatic nice, reason [?] my adidas run, that's reason [?] 
 And this season, [?] when I hit them with my ring 
 When your boy raises hell, everybody but I pray 
 Hey men, and women too, 
 We don't [?] cause misery loves the miserable 
 But if your life's love is kicking like fight club 
 Let's have a great game and see what the night does 
 Two up, for this great life, if it feels right 
 Go ahead put it up, everybody live it up 
 If tomorrow never comes, 
 Two up, for this great life, if it feels right 
 Go ahead put it up, everybody live it up 
 If tomorrow never comes, 
 I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, now keep it right 
 I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, 
 I got my smarts on, I'm being genius 
 I laugh but I'm serious, I mean it 
 I'm married to my craft and I don't intend on cheating 
 Might be tardy for the party for the meeting 
 The smell of money lingers, go and take a wiff 
 You gonna need some robitussin 'cause I'm a make you sick 
 The first track hit got one straight into the pros 
 Now it's first class trips I set later to the roads 
 I don't get it [?] just creating for the flows 
 Sittin' on the globe, and I'm using it as my comode 
 I know, [?] I know, in the league of my own 
 Ain't nobody close so, clap your hands 
 For el capitan, and somebody tell Spinking to play this track again 
 And ain't no looking back unless I'm backing in 
 I'm a thank you in my speech when I'll win 
 Two up, for this great life, if it feels right 
 Go ahead put it up, everybody live it up 
 If tomorrow never comes, 
 Two up, for this great life, if it feels right 
 Go ahead put it up, everybody live it up 
 If tomorrow never comes, 
 I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, now keep it right 
 I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah
