I'm feeling like Nas in this prime 
 Flow ill manic the game about to be mine 
 The flyest little nigga you ever seen before 
 I'm laughing at them haters that saying I can't blow Rap games finest giving nigga's sinus. Cause my money keep on multiplying and they all minors 
 You can call me young giant 
 Little tyrant killin' rappers on the mike 
 But I ain't violent. I walked in Atlantic like it's my time to welcome home king posters looking like they mine 
 I know they t.I's but in my mind 
 I'm the new king of the game now watch me shine 
 I'm about to run this thing So stay in your lane 
 My competition's the cavaliers without Lebron James. Easy to beat not even close 
 I'm running the coast 
 That B.I.G use to promote 
 Just giving it hope 
 'Cause we the originators and innovators. Ima cash cow I be generating money like Vegas yeah 
 Respect what I'm talking bout 
 Doing big things bout to put my own sneaker out. I know my uncle J looking down on me 
 Waiting for the day the game gone put the crown on me 
 As my career keep rising through the top I feel like Diddy but I'm Diggy 
 Can't stop won't stop Puttin' out heat rocks Rising to the top 
 Been a long time coming like Dre and detox 
 Man let the be rock 
 And you say New York city
