They wanna take away my black card 'cause I got a black card say 
 I don't rap hard 'cause I don't act hard, 
 But if I act hard they would say that's odd and they would still hate I don't get that part 
 I'm too boys to be one of the boys think I got a man servant with your pride of toy 
 Why y'all so salty? To much sodium soy 
 Can ya brother get a q that you only destroy 
 Why should I apologize, for my father's wallet size? 
 Now they wanna get volentell had my mother share the pain in Ms Wallet's eyes? 
 Nah, we den came to far Why my brothers gotta fight like Mufasa and Scar? 
 Get caught up in the system that they profitin' off 
 And they don't see none of the profits at all, uh 
 Look how far we've come from singing freedom songs 
 So why can't we get along? 
 My brother why are you questioning from this point? 
 Uh and to the homies I say you can't deny me my 
 (UN) forgivable blackness 
 (UN) forgivable blackness 
 (UN) forgivable blackness 
 Hey! Yeah! 
 I can see Malcolm at the podium on the ground and Betty Shabass holdin' him 
 He tried to fight 'em but his wounds took a toll on em 
 Dr King too man they got both of em 
 The governments war for Patroliem in the streets try to take control of it every hood from Oakland to Magnolia 
 Black men I don't know what came over us 
 Stop the silliness my nigga 
 I would never revenge my nigga 
 And I don't spell it with an "er" I spell it with an "a" cause that is not what we are 
 We were once kings till we got consumed by material things 
 Womanizing all the women the material brings, it's sick it's powerful let's hear it again! 
 Look how far we've come from singing freedom songs 
 So why can't we get along? 
 My brother why are you questioning from this point? 
 Uh and to the homies I say you can't deny me my 
 (UN) forgivable blackness 
 (UN) forgivable blackness 
 (UN) forgivable blackness 
 Hey! Yeah! 
 You think you know, but you don't know the half of it 
 I don't rap for the cash in it 
 I do it 'cause I'm passionate 
 It's my destiny I have to spit 
 The real MC's I'm the last of it 
 Uh, I ain't down 'cause I ain't from the ghetto 
 Camera liked the scar face, but I'll be all fellow 
 I ain't from the projects, I'm more from the Meadows 
 We've both seen races, I'm on the same level 
 From Memphsis to Zimbabwe y'all got the same blood that's in my veins 
 I ain't the enemy so why you in my face? 
 I ain't yo enemy so let's make peace 
 Look how far we've come from singing freedom songs 
 So why can't we get along? 
 My brother why are you questioning from this point? 
 Uh and to the homies I say you can't deny me my
