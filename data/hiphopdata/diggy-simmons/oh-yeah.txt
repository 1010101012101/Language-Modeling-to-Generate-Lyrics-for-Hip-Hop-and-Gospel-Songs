[Intro] Lupe' Fiasco 
 Diggy what's good man, it's your big brother, Lupe' 
 Long time coming, 
 It's like the future meets the future, of the future, 
 You heard 
 Its some of that laid back, light up that nine chomper, let it marinade, 
 You know 
 Some of that make you wonder, make you ponder, 
 What's he on, most likely I'm beyonder, 
 It's a beautiful thang' 
 [Verse 1] Lupe' Fiasco 
 This gone be a fine ride, see it in my minds eye 
 Black man in a white man's world, ha, blind side 
 Sweeter then key line pies, look how fast the time flies 
 Where you gone to be when the parties over and wine dries 
 Yeah we got nine lives, but they got nine knives 
 We only got once chance, and they get nine tries 
 Tell you the dimes fly, and baby girls a fine prize 
 All I see is money when I look inside this dimes eyes 
 Lifes a bitch, I'll be rich if I make her cry 
 Tears soft tissue turns to money, if you let it dry 
 Increase my worth and she get hurt 
 I'll make a fortune if she dies 
 Take her off of that machine, I'll benefit from her dimise 
 Damn, that's how we are, 
 Take a life, than buy out the bar 
 So lets celebrate, lets make a toast, 
 To succeed in life, just make it go 
 [Hook] Diggy Simmons 
 I got em' like, they screaming like 
 I can't hear ya, louder 
 I got 'em like, they screaming like, turn it up 
 Oh yeah 
 You hear the crowd, they want it now, I puts it down 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh-ooh-oh yeah yeah, oh-ooh-oh yeah yeah 
 Oh-ooh-oh yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 
 [Verse 2] Pharell 
 The one metatronic, mind control sonics 
 Davis and shakira, if ya tryna get me phonic 
 Bitches miss me they on it, haters diss leave a comment 
 And if how I ride make you sick of me, vomit 
 Let me finish my composite 
 As the game change its interesting how odd the cards get 
 Such a random thing and so ironic, 
 I used the whole year trying to defy logic 
 Trying to be the birdy, j said it was to early 
 Just tryna tell you what's happening surely 
 I use my guts when my vision gets mirky 
 Help me, but thankyou lord at the same time, mercy 
 Excuse my French I guess I am not worthy 
 Quietly touching numbers like your watch observe 
 Often misunderstood, ya usely get me wrong 
 Ya tryna get it in, I'm tryna get it on 
 Life is your wife, they keep callin me say he did it wrong 
 Life don't suck suck life, until her titties gone 
 You niggas missions wrong plus you missinformed 
 Hanging under assholes you get shitted on 
 [Hook] Diggy Simmons 
 I got em' like, they screaming like 
 I can't hear ya, louder 
 I got 'em like, they screaming like, turn it up 
 Oh yeah 
 You hear the crowd, they want it now, I puts it down 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh-ooh-oh yeah yeah, oh-ooh-oh yeah yeah 
 Oh-ooh-oh yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 
 [Verse 3] Diggy Simmons 
 Uh, ahead of my time, sometime like a pre-me 
 And I got the co-sign from the dude who was pre me 
 I don't see none of y?all, you see me 
 Y?all can't see me ya Stevie 
 Blow up and I make it look easy 
 Yeah I'm so wack 'cause I'm on TV 
 If I am such an amateur when I come around what you panic for 
 Cause you know I'm hotter than a planets core 
 Hands are sore from writing ice colder than a winters lighting device 
 My clock is mantle so my timing's tight I know you think that Lupe's writing right 
 But I'm this nice, foolish thoughts 
 Got more class than my school is taught 
 You haters talk out your cheeks I call it do it saw 
 I hold it down in the streets I rep that New York 
 Just a youngin' that's doing his thing so why are you distraught 
 I got you buster's so gusted 'cause I wasn't so much just discussing 
 And I don't get up g and krumpin' got signed my cousins been coming 
 Don't watch me, watch the repeats 
 You ain't ready know I think I'm Big Meech 
 [Hook] Diggy Simmons 
 I got em' like, they screaming like 
 I can't hear ya, louder 
 I got 'em like, they screaming like, turn it up 
 Oh yeah 
 You hear the crowd, they want it now, I puts it down 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh-ooh-oh yeah yeah, oh-ooh-oh yeah yeah 
 Oh-ooh-oh yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
