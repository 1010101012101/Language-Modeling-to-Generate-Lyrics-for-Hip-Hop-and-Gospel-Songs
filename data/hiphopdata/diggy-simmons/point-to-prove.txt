You know they said I was born with a gold spoon in my mouth right but actually it was platinum 
 But the real point is I didn't ask for this type of life, I didn't plan on it honestly 
 But somethin' I can plan for is wanting to be myself 
 Yeah, and I already know what you expect, Uh 
 Now I'm tell want you gon get 
 You probably see me in the fast lane, flash frame 
 Now let me guess you already know my last name 
 You probably see me on TV 
 Life is so easy 
 But what is it even like to be me? 
 People jumping to conclusion 
 My own name is what am I proving 
 My independent movement, no illusion 
 This isn't nothing new been rapping since the age of five 
 Spiting in the basement of Queens in 1999 
 Writing my own rhymes even though my dad's Rev 
 You never see Mike Jordan dunk through his son, Uh 
 So just 'cause I'm backseat... 
 Don't mean I'm not... trying make a living 
 Best rapper in my division because they slippin' 
 This title is what I'm strippin' 
 I'm giving y'all somethin' different 
 'Cause I got a point to prove 
 And to all the nay sayers this joint's for you 
 And for all the none believers I'm spitting the truth 
 And unlike these lil' dudes, I'm taking my dues 
 So how can I lose 
 'Cause I got a point to prove 
 I bet Imma see about half 100 comments bout 
 Why I ain't the hottest and how I ain't modest 
 At least I'm not ... I'm talking bout violence and some nonsense 
 Of any age Old school or Novice 
 And you know I got this 
 And they can't stop this 
 Andy Milonakis, flow so retarted 
 And never wanna use my dad's name as a crutch 
 So I'm here to prove a point without him or Uncle Russ 
 Don't get my wrong I ain't got a problem with the legacy 
 I'm just tryin' do me, create my own credibility 
 You know dem haterz probably 
 Saying his daddy made a phone call 
 But he probably hear this the same time as all y'all 
 Y'all boi digga is a young go getta 
 Bringin' in the currency and he is a real spitta 
 They sitting at the keyboard bashing him on twitter 
 Gossiping like girls ... Pastries from my sistas 
 Wooh, I bet you had the wrong assumptions 
 Probably thought I would be wack rapping bout nothin' 
 Yeah, I'm just a youngin that's making moves 
 And Yeah I know that I gotta point to prove 
 'Cause I got a point to prove 
 And to all the nay sayers this joint's for you 
 And for all the none believers I'm spitting the truth 
 And unlike these lil' dudes, I'm taking my dues 
 So how can I lose 
 'Cause I got a point to prove
