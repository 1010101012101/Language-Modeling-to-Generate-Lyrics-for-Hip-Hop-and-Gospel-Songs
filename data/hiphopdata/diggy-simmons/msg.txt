Jetsetters, in the place to be, I go by the name of D, I, 
 Two G's, and we gon set it off like we in MSG! 
 Y'all ready to rock? 
 I said it's on like Madison Square, another day, 
 Another blessin I'm just glad to be here. 
 See I do this for y'all, I know y'all rather be here 
 Always keepin' it forward, keep a positive vibe 
 I said it's on like Madison Square, 
 All my hustlers all my ladies let me know you in here 
 Middle finger to suckers chuck a deuce to the haters, 
 I need a moment of silence, now back to the paper
