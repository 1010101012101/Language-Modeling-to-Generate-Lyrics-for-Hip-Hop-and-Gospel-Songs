It's the D-I to the double G reppin' NY 
 Jetsetters stay fly 
 Spin king, lets go 
 I know you've all been waiting patient 
 The game's been needing some stimulation 
 Too much fakin' all the visual simulation 
 I'm all natural, y'all made from concentration 
 We are not adjacent 
 Ladies say that I'm cute 
 Haters say I'm a fluke 
 They try to ruffle my branches but never get to my roots 
 Ugh, don't compare me to niggas that's in my age group 
 If anything compare me to people you're giving praise to 
 Yawa, Jesus, y'all are all hateful 
 All the heat I gave you, y'all should be grateful 
 Stop treating a nigga like I'm in grade school 
 Spittin' like a post grad I don't need a notepad 
 No jeweler but I be dropping gems like a topaz 
 I hear 'em talking but I let 'em rant 
 'Cause I'm a young baller coming up Kevin Durant 
 Yeah I live with my parents but I bring revenue in 
 I don't curse but your favorite words are two shorts 
 Lyrically, my aims to kill you lames like Newports 
 You can't get me 'cause I'm not even living 
 I'm dark matter, energy trapped in the phsyical prison 
 And my side you've been waiting for is finally risen 
 After the BET cypher now you finally listen 
 There's a few still hissing like an alley cat kitten 
 I'll have you scally wags bitten from my lyrical composition yeah 
 I Am He! 
 Yeah, let that breath 
 The underrated, the underdog, underage, underestimated 
 But I will never be underpaid 'cause I oversee 'em 
 Overpower overthrow 'em 
 Had to run for a minute but now it's over for 'em 
 I can run with the best of 'em 
 Shun the rest of 'em 
 Oh that's your idol, watch me make you think less of 'em 
 I Am He 
 Yeah let that breath...
