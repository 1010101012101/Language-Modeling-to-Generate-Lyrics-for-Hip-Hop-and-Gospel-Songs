Four letter word, four letter word 
 Four letter word, four letter word 
 You make me wanna sing to you, ah oh 
 Yeah, it's the little things you do for me, homie, lover, friend 
 I can spend my life with you, ah oh 
 Yeah girl, we ain't gotta thing to lose so, let's go and runaway 
 It's you and me, never gotta worry 
 'Cause we always got each other 
 Like the moon to the sea 
 Girl, you got me feeling your way 
 You're my four letter word, four letter word 
 My four letter word, four letter 
 You're my four letter word, four letter word

 Four letter, four letter word you can be anywhere in the world 
 But you're here with me 
 'Cause you're my four letter word, four letter word 
 And I'm your four letter word, whoa 
 To be loved, to be loved, what a feeling, it's a drug 
 I'ma addicted to ya hugs and ya kisses and ya ah 
 No matter who's around I show affection 
 Walk you on the inside of the sidewalk for protection 
 I need a moment to take it all in, feel so surreal, don't it 
 When you need me call me, I will never leave you lonely 
 And I think that's it corny to just call you my angel 
 You're my Aaliyah, this letter is almost four pages 
 See my parents and your parents don't agree 
 They think our love is temporary 'cause we only teens 
 But not too many get it right on the first try 
 And I'm feeling so right for the first time 
 You're my four letter word, four letter word 
 My four letter word, four letter word 
 You're my four letter word, four letter word 
 My four letter word, four letter word 
 Four letter, four letter word, you can be anywhere in the world 
 But you're here with me 
 'Cause you're my four letter word, four letter word 
 And I'm your four letter word, whoa 
 I don't wanna hear a love song 'cause I live it 
 Every moments memorable we'll never forget it 
 Love the way you pucker up your lips when I peck it 
 When you get this message I'll be right here when you check it 
 My heart, my mind, my soul, my time 
 It's all for you, let me say it one more time 
 My heart, my mind, my soul, my time 
 It's all for you underscore bottom line 
 You're my four letter word, four letter word 
 My four letter word, four letter word 
 You're my four letter word, four letter word 
 My four letter word, four letter word 
 You're my four letter word, four letter word 
 My four letter word, four letter word 
 You're my four letter word, four letter word
