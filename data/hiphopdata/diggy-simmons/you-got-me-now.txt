When you thinkin' 'bout the past starin' through the rearview mirror, mirror, mirror 
 Know I got you all through the pain 
 And I got you and that'll never change. No 
 You never cry when you're with me 
 But don't worry cause you got me now. (Yeah you got me now) 
 You got me now. Oh 
 Hey Mrs. Beautiful there's somethin' that you need to know 
 All your thoughts of past pain they need to go 
 I know its difficult and keepin' your mind up may be hard 
 But know I got you a ??? 
 So don't be lookin' behind you 
 Only to the future so hurt will never come find you 
 Tell me why your cryin boo 
 No need to rewind back 
 To all of the times that 
 You been nevermind that 
 Cause it be hurtin' me probably close to as bad as it hurts you 
 My love is so strong that I can't subdue 
 All that you've been through 
 But it's all right now 
 Cause every bad thought I will turn around 
 When you thinkin' 'bout the past starin' through rearviw mirror, mirror, mirror 
 Know I got you all through the pain 
 And I got you and that'll never change. No 
 You never cry when you're with me 
 But don't worry cause you got me now 
 You got me now. Oh

 Never again 
 Will you gotta live a day when you gotta spend 
 Ya time being disrespected by the wrong man 
 You're my queen so I got some different things planned 
 For our future together we will never be seven 
 We're an inseparable force girl I'm with you forever 
 You're my only and ever 
 Keepin' you happy is a pleasure 
 Nothin' can measure or to me even be better 
 They see in those beautiful eyes 
 Great when you smile 
 Or when you blush so hard you put your head down 
 Its more than that you are the baddest around 
 You're a phenomenal person that I'm so happy I found 
 When you thinkin' 'bout the past starin' through the rearview mirror, mirror, mirror 
 Know I got you all through the pain 
 And I got you and that'll never change. No 
 You never cry when you're with me 
 But don't worry cause you got me now 
 You got me now. Oh
