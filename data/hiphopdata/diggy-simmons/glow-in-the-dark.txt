Can you see me glow in the dark 
 I'm one with the stars, and never too far 
 Yeah 
 Anything worth living is worth dying 
 Anything is worth giving is worth trying 
 I put myself in the shoes of a giant 
 I cover two socks, two knots and I'm tying 
 I was frightened, I was tired 
 But I knew that one day I would triumph 
 Heard of making noise 
 All it took was one guess 
 Now I'm blowing like the wind 
 Underneath the sun dress 
 Ah yes, I can smell the victory 
 They used to pick at me 
 Now they picking me 
 To be the one to hold the torch of liberty 
 I'll tell you every deed till I see that vividly 
 I tried to warn y'all into air born 
 I'm cold like I left the air on 
 I'm dope, I'm dope hair on 
 The world's gonna know from now on 
 Can you see me glow in the dark 
 I'm one with the stars, and never too far 
 Yeah 
 I can see you closing your eyes 
 So don't be surprised 
 All it takes is a spark 
 Till I glow in the dark 
 I imitate, I shine 
 Let this happen 
 From all the town 
 In time, in time, in time I glow in the dark 
 I imitate, I shine 
 Let this happen 
 From all the town 
 In time, in time, in time I glow in the dark 
 I never let them tell me what I can't do 
 God won't give me anything I can't handle 
 One candle can light all the rest 
 I'll live forever like I got a bite on my neck 
 Through my music, through my songs 
 This is your amusement, this is my songs 
 My God, forgive then for adultery 
 Diggy underscore simmons do yo follow me 
 Do you dig me, through your history 
 This didn't happen over night, quite the contrary 
 I've been working all my life 
 You hear what you hear 
 I work hard to get it right 
 They can measure light, they can't measure darkness 
 I ain't on my strikes, that's preposterous 
 First I couldn't care but now look at how I handle this 
 Who would've thought that your thought it couldn't happen 
 Can you see me glow in the dark 
 I'm one with the stars, and never too far 
 Yeah 
 I can see you closing your eyes 
 So don't be surprised 
 All it takes is a spark 
 Till I glow in the dark 
 I imitate, I shine 
 Let this happen 
 From all the town 
 In time, in time, in time I glow in the dark 
 I imitate, I shine 
 Let this happen 
 From all the town 
 In time, in time, in time I glow in the dark 
 Who is more foolish? 
 The child who is scared of the dark 
 Or the man afraid of the light 
 Glow in the dark 
 For everything around you is within you 
 Glow in the dark 
 Glow in the dark 
 Glow in the dark
