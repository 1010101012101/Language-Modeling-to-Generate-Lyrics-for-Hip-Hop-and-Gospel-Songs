[Intro] Diggy Simmons and Shianne Phillips 
 Take me as I am 
 Or you can have nothing 
 Nothing at all 
 [Verse 1] Diggy Simmons 
 Uh, yeah 
 Never understood why discrimination existed amongst us people 
 When all of us wanna be taken equal 
 Not for the colour of our skin, or the fact that we fit in, 
 Criteria should be on what's within 
 The heart, mind and soul and where we tryna go, 
 Cause of we caught in the past, how we gonna reach our goals 
 People be so concerned about the cons instead of the pros, 
 That preconcieved notions be blocking out on my flows 
 They be acting like they know they be real quick to throw it out 
 To turn about a kid of the numbers in his bank account 
 I'd appreciate it if you listen then open your mouth 
 Feel alot better if you knew wht you was talking bout 
 Just a youngin grindin feelin' inside 
 That he hasn't got hes point across after numerous times yeah 
 Tellin' people hes a normal kid 
 Following dreams and hopes of one day to makin' it big 
 [Hook] Shianne Phillips 
 So why don't you take me as I am 
 Or you can have nothing, nothing at all 
 So take me as I am 
 Or have nothing at all 
 [Verse 2] Diggy Simmons 
 Just looking around at all the people that surround 
 None of them was with me though, months ago but tellin' me 
 The way that I should go about it the things that I should put out 
 When its expression to me you can tell me how 
 The ways the ropes of being a D I double G G Y 
 The little nigga, that's gonna be fly 
 But alot of the time hes just gotta swallow hes pride 
 Despite of all the people that's making him feel depride 
 Other feels shocked just because of where he came from 
 Labelling what I've done, when you ain't even here taste of 
 None of still on me, I don't even care say some 
 I done heard it all so your two cents won't hurt none 
 And I know that imma keep going wit it, 
 And I know the ridicule I'm rolling with it 
 Just aslong I'm taking for who am 
 And where I'm going cause that's most important to my fam 
 [Hook] Shianne Phillips 
 So why don't you take me as I am 
 Or you can have nothing, nothing at all 
 So take me as I am 
 Or have nothing at all
