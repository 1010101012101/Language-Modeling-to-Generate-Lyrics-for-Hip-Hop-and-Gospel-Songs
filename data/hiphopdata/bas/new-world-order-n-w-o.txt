I swear it feel like a quarter to midnight 
 Riding in [?] 
 Bumping my own shit, bumping my own shit 
 Pedal to the floor, I ain't braking no more 
 And we get paid, that's off words 
 And I been made, ho, that's my word 
 Ho, that's my word 
 This shit is for life, N-W-O 
 I ain't hitting you back, I'm done with you hoes 
 N-w-o 
 Money growing farms, gotta get your figures up 
 Gotta grow an arm fore' you pull your niggas up 
 Spend it on a bond money, you was savin' up 
 And all they could respond is you never gave enough 
 Everything gratuitous 
 You don't want a pot to piss, you want a pool to piss 
 Never taking it for granted like I'm new to this 
 Keep my waitress heavy handed, fuck my stewardess 
 Who is this sick nigga? Jealousy a trait say for you bitch niggas 
 So wait bitch, hold up, get a hold of this nigga 
 Just got out the meeting and they talking big figures 
 But I'ma need more money than these drop a brick niggas 
 Convos and commas, convos and K's 
 If that's what you talking, ho, convos for days 
 Sky so big, got condos in space 
 Let's save the world, all in good taste 
 And we get paid, that's off words 
 And I been made, ho, that's my word 
 Ho, that's my word 
 This shit is for life, N-W-O 
 I ain't hitting you back, I'm done with you hoes 
 N-w-o 
 I got us, [?], that's the truest of it 
 A bird lose itself worth, that's the Louie of it 
 Why so [?]? Realistic, life will pass you, egotistic 
 It's how the universe work, that's the beauty of it 
 Seen you from the first twerk, that's the booty of it 
 Lately been so [?], give me ass, don't need no friendship 
 Living life, all my tickets copped one way 
 And these bitches all in my runway 
 As of late, I drink and smoke everyday 
 Hesitate, just another shot you never take 
 Riding down the block in the Rari 
 Tryna' squeeze two hoes besides me 
 Six at the club, turned twelve at the club 
 You would think these hoes Saimese 
 And they got hommies, bodies 
 And they roll l's if I let them ride shotty 
 Cause that's all it would take 
 Let's save the world, all in good taste 
 And we get paid, that's off words 
 And I been made, ho, that's my word 
 Ho, that's my word 
 This shit is for life, N-W-O 
 I ain't hitting you back, I'm done with you hoes 
 N-w-o 
 Me? I'm too fly, y'all sweet, y'all niggas fruit flies 
 Y'all speak, y'all niggas hoopla, y'all weak, y'all [?] 
 I must be the coldest, walk up in the room (vroom) 
 And ya bitch old, I'm looking for some new's 
 I must be the coldest, walk up in the room (vroom) 
 And ya bitch old, I'm looking for some new's
