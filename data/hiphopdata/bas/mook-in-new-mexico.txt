Fuck a penny for your thoughts nigga any how 
 I just called my nigga Rahim brought the Henny out 
 Got them things in the Kool-Aid in this mo'fucker 
 Like a gang of Gorillas in this mo'fucker 
 That's a closed book 
 When she with me got your bitch open 
 And she gone give more when she with me got yo bitch smoking 
 Be alert be alert, be alert be alert be alert be alert be alert 
 Be alert be alert, be alert be alert be alert be alert be alert 
 That's a closed book 
 When she with me got your bitch open 
 And she gone give more when she with me got yo bitch smoking 
 Be alert be alert, be alert be alert be alert be alert be alert

 No tats but my passport got plenty 
 I board flights and I ask do you got Henny 
 And she say, courvoisier 
 I say fuck it I would like plenty 
 How many of these nights do I got in me 
 Couldn't really tell blind everyday same time 
 Picture every face drawn on got on a for sale sign 
 Me I gotta stay sharp, can't afford a stale mind 
 See I'm bout my bread mother fucker and I can't afford a stale mind 
 My city grimy that rollie shiny, well you can't afford to tell time 
 And they gotta take squats on the jail time 
 'Cause nobody got guap for the bail bonds 
 And they had to get street 'cause college ain't cheap 
 And mamma gon' eat, if we gotta pop heat so be it 
 Puttin' in work so be it 
 And that shit work you see it 
 Put your latest work in a hearse and I send it to the dirt 
 Little nigga that's where your CD is, CC em 
 Oh, put 'em on alert, me I make art 'cause its from the heart 
 Love me till I'm gone when I die you gonna have to hear the fuckin' museum to see it, Bas
