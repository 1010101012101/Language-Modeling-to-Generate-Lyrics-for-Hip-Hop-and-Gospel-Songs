I don't know, maybe we can make a change 
 Maybe not 
 I'm tired of cryin' I'm tired of livin' 
 I'm tired of niggaz I'm tired of women 
 Just wanna be myself 
 Keep the fame keep the wealth 
 Gimmie my health 
 Take me to a place where there ain't hatin' nomore 
 Where I don't gotta raise the hammer and clap the 4 
 Where I don't gotta kick your door and ask for more 
 Where I don't gotta dig your floor and look for raw (whoa!) 
 Where I don't gotta serve no heads 
 Cook no coke, no such thing as FEDS 
 And there's no such thing as AIDS 
 And little kids live the age 
 They walk the stage 
 No little babies cryin' 
 Momma ain't dyin' 
 Poppa livin' home 
 He got a steady job 
 Everybody full, he don't gotta rob 
 Damn... 
 Walk wit' me talk wit' me 
 Sometimes I just sit and think 
 You know its hard to express it y'all 
 That's why I put it all in ink 
 We ain't black and white 
 Matter fact we are, but we don't have to fight 
 Or kill... 
 Maybe Malcolm woulda been alive still 
 Maybe Martin woulda been able to chill 
 Maybe a black face on a dollar bill 
 I keep hope alive 
 That I stay alive 
 I think its comin', I'm tryin' not to drink and drive 
 A place where the death penalty is gone 
 No arbotions, life only lives on 
 Nobody gettin' shot for they chains 
 And no hard labour jobs, we all usin' our brains 
 And you don't have to strip through school 
 Cover your body momma, everythin' is cool 
 Let your daughter know her momz is smart 
 And ask your heart 
 Before you tear her apart 
 I think I'm askin' for too much, man 
 Damn... 
 No murders on the 5 o'clock news 
 No body's over jordan and tennis shoes 
 Nobody layin' on me, waitin to blast 
 I feel the spirits of my niggaz that passed 
 It's like they rite here, I just can't see 'em 
 Sometimes I'm jealous of 'em 
 Damn, I wanna be 'em 
 Everybody fake, when will this ever end 
 If you don't know your enemy then you don't know your friend 
 A place where there's nomore wars, nomore tears 
 Nomore liquor, nomore beers 
 Nomore stocks, nomore shares 
 Nomore fights, nomore jails 
 Nomore kites... a place where you don't value money 
 Just the air you breathe and everyday is sunny 
 'Know it can never happen 
 And its just rappin' 
 And I'm dreamin' 
 But damn... 
 Repeat chorus till end (with libs)
