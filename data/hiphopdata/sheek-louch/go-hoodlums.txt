It time. lock in. 
 Go Hoodlums, Go Thugs 
 All my street niggas, 
 Movin them drugs. 
 Go strip bitch, make a nigga rich 
 I know the ready ain't really gon like this 
 But 
 Go Hoodlums, Go Thugs 
 All my street niggas, 
 Movin them drugs. 
 Go strip bitch, make a nigga rich 
 I know the ready ain't really gon like this 
 But 
 1st verse: 
 I see everybody talking bout what crisp they drinking 
 But no body really saying what a thug be thinking. 
 See they bitches don't know you 
 Till you come with the lincoln. 
 Or the porsce eyes lift up like the car was winking. 
 Real niggas on the block 
 Wit big dimes in his sock 
 You bet somewhere is a glock 
 Post it up
