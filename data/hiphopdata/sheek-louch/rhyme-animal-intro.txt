Gorilla, yeah, gorilla, yeah 
 You know who dump 
 Under the palm trees, 
 Underground to monkey let them in this game like pimp and 
 Niggers you're like fucked up like 
 I'm like in a 
 You wanna see me a rap, I call 
 I'm like, piece, I've been working down, 
 When I used to do this 
 Cracking to 80's 
 Beat a man with the ladies, 
 Once again back 
 The incredible, rhyme animal.
