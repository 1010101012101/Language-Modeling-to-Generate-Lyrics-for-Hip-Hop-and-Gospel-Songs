Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain 
 The pain that a man as just didn't do it 
 When two junior flip hot rod lovin' pig police man 
 (Pain) put 'em in a position where he must choose 
 Against humiliation as a man or death 
 (Pain) leave your head, 'cause you outta be dead 
 (Sheek Louch) 
 Block-a this is your brain on drugs 
 Love is pain and pain is love 
 (Jadakiss) 
 Block-a this your brain on drugs 
 Y'all came wit police we came wit thugs 
 (Sheek Louch) 
 Ayo I droped pain on 'em, switched the game on 'em 
 Whoever out there hot I'mma rein 'em 
 I see niggaz slowin down I'mma gain on 'em 
 No beef but fuck it put his brain on 'em 
 Uh if his face is hurtin' 
 I'm in Yonkers comin' down burnin in that thing wit the curtain 
 Pants leg up call me Sheek Cool J 
 Hat low shorty from paris run way, the thing is loaded 
 Eatin lunch wit politician and I don't even think I voted 
 They see my face they think I'm rich 
 I'm by myself they think I'm bitch 
 Until they layin why doctors stitch 
 'Cause I clap like a nasty bitch 
 You don't know me, you know my name 
 You heard my raps, but you don't feel my pain 
 I got more than you lookin' for--> Sheek Louch

 (Jadakiss) 
 Yeah, yo, uh, sort of like in a vangelis 
 'Cause you hear it but you don't know how to handle this 
 Uh, be it nine or the knife 
 Everybody felt it at sometimes in they life 
 It's all different kinds to endure 
 Pain is pure and most time it ain't no pure 
 That's why I'm in the hood I don't be where the stars is 
 One of my records is platinum but all of my cars is 
 You pokin Mount Air lodge is 
 I'm Germnay tall bust menage a trois', "Trading Places" 
 If you don't like the hand you was dealt just make sure you save your aces 
 Uh, and I'm gettin' a lil Dividends 
 Big Boys think I'm distributin 
 Divin off yachts in the Caribbean 
 Yeah, that's just the life that we livin' in 
 (Sheek Louch) 
 AYo, I'm ridin' dirty 
 On the passenger side wit just the premier me and my birdy 
 Lui boots red monkey jeans on 
 Jamaica chick get my sex and Queens on 
 Haze lit, blunt lick finger thick 
 Flow make 'em all fight like a spring a chick 
 Sheek Louch and Jada *meowa* 
 Put 'em half dollar hoes on the side of your car 
 (Jadakiss) 
 Yo neva put your eyein away 
 Dream like you livin' forever but live like you dyin' today 
 Uh, 38 is new, 357 is a lil older 
 Everythin' else is for the shoulder 
 From hear on I spit it on red form 
 Brinin these niggaz eatin the ground of air born 
 And you just runnin' your mouth, stay in your house 
 If you don't know nuttin about no PAIN!
