All I got is my word and my balls 
 And ain't break them for nobody! 
 I've always shot guns straight ? started, 
 ? 
 I got a shot gun, 
 Check! 
 I got a vest on my chest! 
 Check! 
 I got a million in the bank, 
 Check! 
 And now I'm ready for war, for war! 
 When I talk around the hood they say shit, not crap, 
 Fast cars like they come with parachutes in the back. 
 Fifty piece? 
 When I go back to ? the best story I ever told. 
 ? I hide you in the bushes? 
 My status will still, but the hood still remains, 
 Money got bigger, my boss is cocaine. 
 Pulling ? try to stay up in my lane, 
 I just got off the plane? 
 If ain't in the hood it means I'm beyond 
 I'll still be in the front in front of my store. 
 ? Tell them be black to the death, yeah! 
 ? Murder, murder, murder, 
 And all the other shit you've never heard of! 
 All I got is my word and my balls 
 And ain't break them for nobody!

 And now I'm ready for war, for war!

 Raising my mouth like a giant with the blade, 
 Raising my head like a knife with a 
 A lot of green on us like... 
 Down, down about to blow up a grenade.

 A couple millimeters and they'll be taxed. 
 You could tell the way I act, a nigger with the 
 The way I thought that money she won't give me sex. 
 All I got is my word and my balls 
 And ain't break them for nobody!

 Hey oh, tough ? listen to the way the niggers rap, 
 They don't know from the ass to the elbow 
 Now I'm next to ? sell it like radio, 
 I'm now to put your brains on the floor, ? 
 Orange mustang, green interior, looking like fall 
 A whole bunch of shooters, gone on my laptop,
