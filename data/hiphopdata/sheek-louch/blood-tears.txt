You ready, you ready? Let's go, let's go 
 I'm from the land where has no hope for tomorrow, no, no 
 I think back and cry at the bathroom still a lie, chill, chill, 
 I can hear, let them hear, sing a song... 
 Thank you, thank you, love it isn't there, chill, chill, 
 Yeah, took a long time, wasn't over night 
 Always had to fight, money wasn't looking right 
 Me and my mama grinding, every day's a struggle, more bills than juggle 
 Outside is trouble, no â?¦ the â?¦ just getting bigger 
 But I ain't mad at you paps, you're still my nigger 
 Had my low jobs, sold my low cracks, but I really want my boys heard or wax 
 Had flash backs, homies getting killed, blood getting spilled 
 Jails getting billed, shit's twisted, real statistic 
 Being a rapper, this wasn't realistic 
 Drug dealer was, triple bean, cocaine, you ain't gotta spit it sixteen 
 Had big plans for my whole team, we gonna pop off no matter how hard it seems 
 I'm from the land where has no hope for tomorrow, no, no 
 I think back and cry at the bathroom still a lie, chill, chill, 
 I can hear, let them hear, sing a song... 
 Thank you, thank you, love it isn't there, chill, chill, 
 Ladies, sing the song 
 Yeah, now I'm rolling in the S class 
 Big houses, signs, no trespassing 
 Free at last, Martin Luther King, yeah, vip, Louie 13 
 Spending money on that rose gold, big diamonds, club in the ...hole 
 Money can't fold, gotta lay it out, two chicks, which one got a weight it out? 
 Got ammo on me, in case we gotta spray it out 
 Know what I'm about, too many damn chairs, too much hustling for papers all these damn years 
 Now I got it, I'ma keep it, yeah 
 I'm from the land where has no hope for tomorrow, no, no 
 I think back and cry at the bathroom still a lie, chill, chill, 
 I can hear, let them hear, sing a song... 
 Thank you, thank you, love it isn't there, yeah 
 Yeah, I ain't forget where I'm from, I breathe hip hop down to my last lung 
 For the DJ's that play my records, yo 
 For my fans that show me love at my show, yeah 
 For my homies that stuck with me 
 People on the radio stations who fuck with me 
 Who can't be real, and they act dumb 
 Thank you, tell them where I'm from 
 I'm from the land where has no hope for tomorrow, no, no 
 I think back and cry at the bathroom still a lie, chill, chill, 
 I can hear, let them hear, sing a song... 
 Thank you, thank you, love it isn't there, chill, chill, 
 It's not what I hear, too many tears 
 It's not what I hear, too many tears, tears, oh, oh, blood, tears, oh.
