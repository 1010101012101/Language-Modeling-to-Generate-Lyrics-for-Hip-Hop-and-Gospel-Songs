(Sheek Louch) 
 Jump out the Rover nigga 
 Hoodie on, back to carryin' them thangs 
 Summer's ova nigga (Oh Summer's ova) 
 I clap my shit 
 Just copped a GT, album bout to drop 
 I'm bout to rap my shit 
 They go see me way upstate 
 Sheek Louch: After Taxes 
 G-Unot on the plate (G-UNOT!) 
 The crack is beige, the wine is aged 
 The yak is strong, the barrel is long 
 Sheek show these little niggas ass like thongs (BITCH!) 
 I ain't spit that shit to get dis whip 
 Your advance: I made that with just this trip 
 Next trip I'm savin' my dough 
 I already know the hip hop police sit and study my flow 
 So I throw 'em off, play the golf course 
 Disappear like AIDS 
 Yellow fo wit the Polo plaid pants 
 And ever since New Orleans 
 I've been comin' through Queens 
 Coppin' weed and crazy blunts 
 Word is, Curtis rats and they ain't seen you once 
 Diamoned up 
 Back with Bad Boy reminiscin', me and Big both Bacardi Limoned up (What Up Big!) 
 They say I'm too sick for the new school 
 I can't attend classes, so I just build up the masses 
 Red Monkey jeans, Belushi glasses 
 Me just sittin' there, causin' some crashes 
 Sheek a rare breed 
 They don't understand what I'm doin' there 
 With some sunflower seeds (I'm in the hood nigga) 
 10-10in', army coat no linen 
 Doo rag, but not from my head 
 The beat's spinnin' 
 They sayin' what the street's been missin' 
 Dropped Walk Wit Me, but that was just for the streets to listen 
 November 8th, I'm comin' back like the wrath 
 Y'all bitch niggas y'all ain't safe 
 Lets go! 
 (Jadakiss) 
 See the pictures I paint son 
 If I ain't the King of New York then there ain't one 
 Tell me who fuckin' want it 
 And you can put somethin' on it 
 I'm in the O-6 Supercharged wit nothin' on it 
 Mad-hot, to have is to have not 
 My crack spot is pro-tools on my laptop 
 Much cheaper then the carter, it's affordable 
 I ain't neva gotta infiltrate, 'cause it's portable 
 (C'mon) The trey 5-7 is chrome 
 If any big niggas is wit me they just came home 
 Either way I'ma pop that nine 
 Call him 40 Cent now, 'cause he dropped that dime 
 And he got me kinda jammed up right now, I can't lie 
 But I don't know who told his black ass he can't die 
 The other day I made 40 in a hour 
 Fuck, in the studio, I'm Berry Gordy wit the powder 
 No retreat, No surrender 
 I'm at the juice bar, Armageddon's in the blender 
 (NAH!) Getting' ready for the Winter 
 Sweat-suit weather, some reason I shoot better 
 Carry the big gats 
 And leave the scene real fuckin' nasty, like chocolate milk after a Big Mac 
 I'm on my CEO shit right now 
 Till this underhanded politic shit pipe down (Feel Me!) 
 Shout out to the media and maxes 
 November 8th, Sheek Louch: After Taxes
