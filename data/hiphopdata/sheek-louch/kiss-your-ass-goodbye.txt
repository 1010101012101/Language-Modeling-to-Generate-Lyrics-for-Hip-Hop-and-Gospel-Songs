 Aiyyo, this that shit that make niggaz wanna rep they clique 
 Grab their gun an' diss niggaz to their dick 
 Buck somethin', go somewhere an' fuck somethin' 
 Like that frontin' nigga bitch, make her suck somethin' 
 Wild out, D-Block shirt inside out 
 Hoodie on with the all black Belushis on 
 Niggaz yappin' till they muh'fuckin' face is torn 
 Tongue is gone, three-piece suits is worn 
 Hit y'all fagot ass niggaz that's scared to death 
 Talk shit, when I'm around, y'all hold y'all breath 
 I make murder music, my shit bang in the city 
 But they want me to chill since Janet showed titty 
 It's too much violence now since Ja ruined 50 
 I don't know no other way but to rap gritty 
 Fuck that, baby, when I'm rich 
 Until then where the fuck is my thugs at up in this bitch? Let's go 
 You can kiss your ass goodbye 
 D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block 
 La da da, da da da

 Whattup, nigga? You cut up, nigga 
 Shoot shit to lift the truck up, nigga 
 D-Block, D-Block howl like a wolf 
 Tell your mom I throw a child off the roof 
 Give a basshead a hundred dollars to towel off the Coupe 
 Style on niggaz; beat somethin' down 
 We gon' pile on niggaz, wild on niggaz 
 La da da, da da da 
 That's a lullaby for you 
 Better ask your man, he ready to die for you? 
 We comin' through, tearin' the block up 
 We ain't gettin' locked up, that mean we even shootin' the cops up 
 Whattup? Yeah nigga, two mo' times 
 Whattup, whattup? Now we in the New York rhyme 
 Better kiss that ass goodbye, when I'm passin' by 
 With plastic nines to blast your eyes, right, what, nigga? 
 You can kiss your ass goodbye 
 D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block 
 La da da, da da da 
 D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block 
 You can kiss your ass goodbye 
 D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block 
 La da da, da da da 
 Aiyyo, I talk shit how I wanna talk, bop how I wanna walk 
 An' you can tell that nigga dere is from New York 
 An' I still got my South niggaz ready to squeeze 
 I don't need cake to see me with a couple of G's 
 An' I don't need a loan, muh'fucker, I'm grown 
 Had a thirty eight before I had a phone 
 I stuck niggaz up before y'all lil' niggaz started to bone 
 This that Sheek Louch shit, y'all niggaz tryin' to clone 
 Let's be real, the average muh'fucker with a deal 
 Probably never had a fight, no guns, none of that 
 Niggaz know I'm right, I say goodnight to my son 
 Give my baby moms a lil' cake 
 An' my moms a lil' somethin' 'fore I go on the run 
 Before pussy niggaz try their hand 
 I'll kick in the door like, "Daddy's home" 
 An' I ain't 'Making The Band' 
 What y'all coward niggaz don't understand? Yeah 
 You can kiss your ass goodbye
