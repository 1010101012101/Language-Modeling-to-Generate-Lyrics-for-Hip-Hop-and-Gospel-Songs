Small talk is irrelevant 
 Down to kill an elephant 
 Niggas look fly in their bitches look elegant 
 Let the birds fly like a pelican 
 From NY out to Maryland 
 Be more careful them little niggas hear ya 
 Tattoo tears overhead if you dare to 
 Yeah, wax out the trippy 
 Racks off the other shit 
 Max with the hippys 
 Mack out the window if niggas act iffy 
 M's off the piffy 
 Shits getting sticky like jiffy 
 Hood gon? cry if they hit me 
 I'm a real ass nigga get with me 
 Kush in the grinder and my looks is designer 
 My dope is raw like I got good from China 
 Always on some other shit 
 Even the hatin' niggas is lovin' it 
 Even the hatin' niggas is lovin' it 
 Even the hatin' niggas is lovin' it 
 Even the hatin' niggas is lovin' it 
 Fuck all the hoe ass niggas and fuck the government 
 Haters still lovin' it 
 But I don't give a fuck if they didn't 
 I'm black lovin' it 
 Poppin' off on some other shit 
 Hand on the tommy couple shooters behind me 
 They tryin' to take the black man out like Mitt Romney 
 Me and P add 2 when its 3D 
 Imax movie, chain and our watches is duplicate 
 They love my style, alligator band on the Heblut 
 True Religions on, Louie kicks all on the big toe 
 You don't think I seen a million dollars I did though 
 Christopher Wallace money, every night is a big show 
 Hit the gym, bag lookin' fuckin' forigno 
 Don Don, bitch be on my dick from the get go ah 
 Its crack or gas for the dollars 
 Ride around town in the black Impala 
 Niggas could act wilder 
 Show up at your moms crib 
 Same ass guns Sin of act of Valor 
 Sort like the car they gave me no hope 
 I'm real rugged yet smoother than the aveeno soap 
 I mean body wash 
 Up on the shore where his body washed 
 It wasn't me, I was smoking weed with his bodyguard 
 I'm not feelin' you, prolly made a plan or killin' ya 
 A- rap, nigga I'm willin' to 
 I?ma mob boss all day part of a ?like John Forte 
 But ego is liquid, connect seem solid though 
 Any signs of the Feds, motherfuckin? vamonos 
 Put quote on the streets before I do twenty years 
 Being broke is the only thing money fears
