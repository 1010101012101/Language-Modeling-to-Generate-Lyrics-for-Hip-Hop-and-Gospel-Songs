(Sheek talking) 
 Yo I mean you been there for me. 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 And I won't you know, I won't do you wrong ever again. 
 Know what I mean? 
 You've been there, and Imma be there for you from now on. 
 You know what I mean? 
 I ain't gonna neglect you I ain't gonna do none of that shit. 
 You got my full undivided attention and I ain't afraid to say it, 
 I love you, I love you, I love you, fuck it I love you 
 (How I love you) I ain't afraid to say it, I'm a thug 
 (How I love you) more than that, I'm a man. 
 You know wut I mean (How I love you) I'm in love. 
 You my bitch lets go 
 I used to dream about you watchin every move you made 
 I was young tho, I think 3rd or 2nd grade 
 Id go home write a poem put it rite to a beat 
 What I would do, what I would say if we would one day meet 
 I started gettin' older still lovin' ur style 
 How you dressed, how you drove the whole 80s wild 
 I was proud when you first got on MTV 
 You was in the video chillin' with Run DMC 
 That's my girl, knowin' a nigga feinin to hit it 
 Knowin' one day in the future id be rite up in it 
 I started doin' talent shows I had it off the hook 
 You was there but you was to big, u wouldn't even look 
 I ain't mad, u didn't notice till I got in a group 
 But even then it wasn't nothin' unless I got in the coop 
 Got me goin' crazy everyday you'd switch up on me 
 Puttin' that rite in my face knowin' me so horney 
 (How I love you) You all I got, you all I want, you all I need 
 (How I love you) From day 1 to my death bed you all I breathe 
 (How I love you) I'm disciplined I'm dedicated and determined too 
 (How I love you) You got ur ups and downs but I don't really mind I still ride wit u 
 Ok Listen the group doin' good 
 Still in the hood 
 I got a nickname Sheek 
 Now you startin to speak 
 Said you wana fuck wit all 3 if that's ok 
 I was like cool, once I hit it it was that anyway 
 A couple years gone past still havin' a ball 
 How many times got them picures hangin' all on my wall 
 When I first hit it I was like sheek da man 
 I stopped givin' you the attention I origanally planned 
 Then you stopped fuckin' wit me 
 And left me alone 
 People only seein you wit Jada and P 
 U even went around town started doggin me bad 
 It was my fault you no, I couldn't even get mad 
 I had to rap a pen and pad and get rite back 
 Write sum more poems to ur ass and get back on track 
 I ain't got no problem tellin' you I love you to death 
 And that I'm whipped and my shitll be blown if you skip 
 I had to hit the streets they said you'd be out there a lot 
 And I could find you around any nigga out that's hot 
 Every club, every whip, everys gamblers spot 
 You no you'd rather be with me, you like to bug out 
 Love to bring the thug out 
 Plus I be keepin' it tite 
 We even go to work together let you play all night 
 Laugh loud while I sit and I write 
 We done seen the world together but not on cable 
 All your friends lovin' me you even got me a label 
 You got the magazines lovin' our realations 
 People like to hear us talk, DJs record our conversations 
 You good around other people, especially kids 
 You make them happy, even brothers doin' their bids 
 And I ain't jealous at all go out and spread you wings 
 U can hang wit pac just pick up the phone when it rings 
 I ain't gonna lie to y'all I'm WHIPPED
