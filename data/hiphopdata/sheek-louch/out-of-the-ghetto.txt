I'm sorry, my father, I was just trying to make a dollar 
 I'm trying to get a dollar in the ghetto 
 Sunshine is I heard of I see is nothing but murder 
 Gotta make a dollar in the ghetto 
 Jonnie, yeah, I finally got my benjamins money back 
 Shades on, sitting in my coupe is jet black 
 Shorty I ask that, I drove with them thugs and them gunshots 
 My mama had no choice was surrounded by crack spots 
 (I love you, ma) 
 These canaries and black rocks, 
 Drop tops flying on the alley way 
 Him on my ride side, black and white chain on 
 Africa never giving nothing, always have to go and get it, go get it 
 Bandana on my face, Yankee fit it 
 So now you understand where I'm coming from 
 That's why I get back, you have to respect this, respect that 
 I'm down on my knees praying I tell him that 
 I'm sorry, my father, I was just trying to make a dollar 
 I'm trying to get a dollar in the ghetto 
 Sunshine is I heard of I see is nothing but murder 
 Gotta make a dollar in the ghetto 
 Yeah, I'm a ghetto boy, ? like bush with the scar face 
 Speeding, you would think I'm in a car chase 
 40 out the crack window, this is no game DS Nintendo 
 I'm from the building where we live ? car washes 
 I'm the topic throw your apples in your Macintosh 
 Where you get your feet wet at, no galoshes 
 They say she gonna fire, her prognosis 
 Am I wrong for wanting more money more choose? 
 Am I wrong for wanting less stress less fools? 
 Down on my knees, I know I ain't angel, but I'm ? so let me in please 
 I'm sorry, my father, I was just trying to make a dollar 
 I'm trying to get a dollar in the ghetto 
 Sunshine is I heard of I see is nothing but murder 
 Gotta make a dollar in the ghetto 
 Yeah, and now I throw that money at them girls in the pole 
 I'm nice now so they say that I'll be bribing with soul 
 But you don't know about the roaches crawling out of the bowl 
 No lunch meat just butter put on a roll 
 Yeah, police wanna follow in force 
 They say I'm going fast 'cause they hear their exhaust 
 Yeah, down on my knees, safety on my glock 
 I'm asking God to forgive me please 
 I'm sorry, my father, I was just trying to make a dollar 
 I'm trying to get a dollar in the ghetto 
 Sunshine is I heard of I see is nothing but murder 
 Gotta make a dollar in the ghetto.
