Naw I say uh oh, uh oh, uh oh 
 (Sheek Louch) 
 Aced out yached out not givin' a fruck 
 West side highway doin' over a buck 
 Broad day it's like Curtis May shotgun wit me 
 White airs, blue jeans this the top of dickie 
 I ain't picky, some sticky in the bitch to roll it 
 Phat ass Lui or Gucci or work to hold it 
 50 thousand big heads kind of hard to fold it 
 And I don't need needle or threat to say I sold it 
 Big money, big guns and all that stuff 
 Black brief case, one wrist handcuff 
 You get you man snuffed 
 Fuck 'em like G-O-D 
 Got that white boy sellin like pOD 
 And I ain't tryin' to sun y'all 
 Or some tough guy shit I just ain't scared to none y'all 
 Run y'all 
 Ten years strong, you one year weak 
 Y'all ain't fuckin' wit Sheek 
 Bark at the frawg 
 (Chorus: Ghostface Killah and Sheek Louch) 
 Yo Sheek---> Ghostface Killah 
 Wuttup nigga---> Sheek Louch 
 Show these mothafuckers yeah the retail price---> Ghostface Killah 
 That cost to get they face blowned off---> Ghostface Killah 
 200 bean if that---> Ghostface Killah 
 'Cause is no lost 'em---> Sheek Louch 
 Niggaz don't give a fuck if you come up short, naw---> Sheek Louch 
 You fuckin' wit gangsta---> Ghostface Killah 
 Architecture niggaz that pain all loosely---> Sheek Louch 
 Twist you back like we just twist the top of coolie, at the Oscars---> Ghostface Killah 
 Jane all doogie---> Sheek Louch 
 Stick up kids is the name of our movie, nigga---> Ghostface Killah 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Yo I get married in crutch Velvet 
 Diamond chip shit that'll squash elders 
 You know the steez when I come through steamin my stones 
 Through on eight floor studed it out cleanin my chrome 
 I disinfect niggaz, wash 'em, rinse 'em and hang dry 'em 
 Bang iron, to all top is pro-long 'cause it takes science 
 No larceny, murder experts in the feds, yo they on to me 
 Like I murdered Vonny, me and Sheek Louch 
 We can regroup, we can recoupe 
 We eat leak soup, speed race across country in the mean coupe 
 We got whips and big chains at the day back routes 
 Enron money, they say we goin' down on tax invasion 
 Tellin' cops if they try to cuff us the max is sprayin 
 Finally the head in they hats where they badge is layin 
 On the floor right along where their colleague is prayin' 
 Nigga, this is Theodore and D-Block 
 Fuck 'round and get your meat chopped 
 (Chorus: Ghostface Killah and Sheek Louch) 
 (Sheek Louch) 
 Ease back, what's that all about, huh? 
 I dare y'all niggaz tryin' to play Sheek Louch out 
 Like I don't find talent like a Yankees Scout 
 Like I ain't still got it when papi on the drought 
 The hood got swear tryin' to be circle 
 I don't give a fuck I'll leave a bunch dead Urkels 
 I don't pillow talk, I'll tell a hoe what she need to know 
 I don't care if she thicker than pizza dough, I'm out standin 
 I ain't even landin in the same place I use to when I come down high 
 I wake up wit two bitches in between my thigh 
 And I ain't Hollywood or rich, bitch I ain't Mcky 
 I just mad at tellin' a good ass lie 
 Yo, nuttin 'bout me soft, I don't care if you got cake 
 Whateva, go'head go on brush you shoulders off 
 I be in the hood, Sheek Louch good 
 (Chorus: Ghostface Killah and Sheek Louch)
