Guess who's coming to dinner... mighty D-block 
 Guess who's coming to dinner... mighty mighty D-Block 
 D-Block- oh-oh-oh-oh D- block 
 (Sheek Louch) 
 (Louder, louder, yeah, Don Don) 
 Okay I lyrically ejaculate 
 I come on tracks go 'head and hate 
 Go inside, run and hide 
 'Cause this gon boost the murder rate 
 Flying with the long behind me 
 Nickel plate, extra shiny 
 Got this woman on my tip like they name is Tiny 
 Every hood, light is up, dark liquor, plastic cup 
 Sour diesel, hoodie on, gun out like what the fuck 
 Porsche turbo, yankee blue, Derek Jeter of his crew
