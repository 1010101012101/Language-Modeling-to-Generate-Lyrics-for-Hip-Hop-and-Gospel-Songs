I just want to Thank y'all for taking the time to listen 
 I appreciate that 
 Yo regular TV to cable from bouncing label to label 
 Just trying to get the horse out the stable 
 Was once part of a dynasty, well least I was trying to be 
 Think it was the time when I was finding me 
 Sitting in the spot with the dimes willing to do anything to be a bad boy at the time 
 Then I rolled the dices nah the money didn't add up 
 But just that whole experience it was priceless 
 No free rides to the bank on top of that was the untimely demise of Frank (BI) 
 Then the No Way Out Tour we was smoking outdoor spent 80 stacks on C LO that without tour 
 Videotape it all I still watch it, now travel the world learn how to rock a crowd 
 It ain't much but it beats poor Things that I been through is all I can speak for 
 (Chorus: Luther) 
 I can only speak for the things that I been through 
 I can only speak for the things that I been through 
 Now I'm on Ruff Ryder Interscope same shit Partnership Joint Venture 50/50 same split 
 Jimmy put the money up two singles off of we are the streets 
 Then after that seem like he was done with us but it wasn't over yet 
 Styles had a plan from the jump which was to come out with my solo next 
 Things a little better these the niggas that I been doing it with forever so I'm like whatever 
 First album dropped promotion was hella Every stage I rocked performance was stella 
 Had the whole world ready to ride or die for me and I wasn't platinum I was just side money 
 X was bringing the mulla I was in the hood in the kitchen with the digital ruler 
 I can't tell 'bout the evil me do, I can only speak for the things that I been through 
 (Chorus: Luther) 
 I can only speak for the things that I been through 
 I can only speak for the things that I been through 
 As far as the LOX we all fine cellar is all wine 
 Selfish for me to say Roc Fella is all mine cause it ain't 
 I'm just a another employee that's on line trying to get my act together and do it one more time 
 Twenty-one gunz salute with all nines and I know it's on me to make sure we all shine (Gotta) 
 Fall Back let the weed contact your mind, 
 Confined all bull shit in any contract you sign 
 If you from the streets though it's plenty of loop holes to eat 
 Yo once they let you in your suppose to keep doe 
 But I can't give you the formula I'm on it though 
 Expect the worst the outcome is enormous though stay humble 
 Still keep your heat for insurance though 
 Things that I been through to get it weren't normal yo 
 Yeah This is what my heart beats for 
 Things that I been through is all that I can speak for
