S this different man, this yo? 
 You could of have the Range Rover, 
 The Mercedes and all that 
 When I come through, 
 Sitting that low candy thing dripping, 
 You gotta see me baby 
 I love so, my old school, dripping from my old school 
 I can touch the sky in my old school, yeah 
 My old school's car smart than your new school 
 I didn't had everything on aboard 
 Everything from trucks to bikes to, 
 Leaning in front and looking good 
 Until I've seen these old heads 
 67 73's candy painted, 
 Race tracks full of, 
 To the back gotta get me one of these 
 Low low, no low, these women here want my photo 
 That make them haters mad 
 I keep the, sticky burning club is bad 
 You all know what color's that 
 All you know it's Donnie G Shorty with the maxed that 
 Check that, the valley parking, but that was when I spark it 
 VIP see me, I'm the hottest thing out on the market 
 Candy dripping, extra flipping, rose on patrol sipping low pro 
 I got the Mercedes but chill 
 I love so, my old school, 
 Dripping from my old school 
 I can touch the sky in my old school, yeah 
 My old school's car smart than your new school 
 I hope it's in the Caddy 
 No matter what it takes, old school 
 Man I'm walking, 
 Pipper, I can't make walk, 
 We stitch it on the does, great car coy dripping 
 And, got the does of a butterfly 
 Truck is going boom, better make room for my elbow 
 I'm about to go to them whose, 
 I'm so, and I'm so relaxed 
 I'm blowing, plus I'm blowing stag 
 So hope you bet, don't try to fry 
 Get up by the way you're about to start, what? 
 I love so, my old school, dripping from my old school 
 I can touch the sky in my old school, yeah 
 My old school's car smart than your new school 
 This is for my homies in the ghetto 
 6777, old school 
 Donnie G, Donnie G, let's go 
 Back up in the hood again, love it though 
 That's where I got my flow and got my dope before I came professional 
 B.b yellow... I don't know what kind of games they play 
 I'm getting money popping nerves, flying down the highways 
 You never met a G like me, every low nigger wanna be like 
 Gucci, for free, women all around me like 1, 2, 3 
 Gotta wear a people's trampoline 
 Know these haters is after me, and hard to see the way I be 
 All you gotta do I search for me 
 I love so, my old school, dripping from my old school 
 I can touch the sky in my old school, yeah 
 My old school's car smart than your new school 
 This is for my homies in the ghetto 
 This is for my homies in the ghetto 
 6777, old school.
