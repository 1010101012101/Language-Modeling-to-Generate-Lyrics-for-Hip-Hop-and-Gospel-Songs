Yo yo, School, cuzin', what's up man? What's up with the record business? 
 Man, I think I'ma have to beat somebody up, man, they always be bitin' my shit man, y'know, man, just bitin', man 
 Man, I told you how them niggas are man, they ain't nothin' but squares 
 Oh, that's what they is 
 Yo Schoolly, what time is it? 
 Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time 
 For MC Schoolly D to start hummin' a rhyme, 
 I heard you was out there writin' my lines, 
 And if I catcha boy, yo' ass is mine 
 You always in my face sayin' "Schoolly School, man 
 How the fuck didja get so cool, man, 
 Never ever seen you play no fool" 
 'Cause I use that microphone like a plumber use a tool 
 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and (x2) 
 MC Schoolly D, and I'm 
 I've never had a party that I cannot rock 
 And every baby girl thinks she's gettin' the world, 
 I've never made a tune that wasn't too cool 
 Never been stopped next to T O P 
 For him to try to fuck with MC Schoolly D 
 2 Dolla bitches on my kitches 
 Suckah MC's taken out with the dishes 
 Rhymes so delicious, raps so vicious 
 Buy me a wife to do my dishes 
 I keep ya in stitches 
 Ya hangin' in kitches 
 No itch, no ash, no crust, no bitches 
 I eat sandwiches 
 My best brand bitches, 
 Based on that, not based 
 Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time 
 For MC Schoolly D to start hummin' a rhyme, 
 I heard you was out there writin' my lines, 
 And if I catcha boy, yo' ass is mine 
 You always in my face sayin' "Schoolly School, man 
 How the fuck didja get so cool, man, 
 Never ever seen you play no fool" 
 'Cause I use that microphone like a plumber use a tool 
 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and 
 F-D-C K-I-N-G 
 Guitars and the J's tossin' in a tree 
 Adam and Eve, Birds and the bees, 
 Everybody do it but the suckah MC's 
 Rockson did it, in UGFO 
 About a sucka nigga down callin' a ho 
 I say baby doll, can ya meet me in the black? 
 We do it from the front, and we do it from the back 
 But don't, don't do it, 'cause niggas are sly, 
 They ain't got no job, they be down with the mob 
 And the only thing you'll doin' 
 But the only thing you'll get is burn, baby burn 
 Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time 
 For MC Schoolly D to start hummin' a rhyme, 
 I heard you was out there writin' my lines, 
 And if I catcha boy, yo' ass is mine 
 You always in my face sayin' "Schoolly School, man 
 How the fuck didja get so cool, man, 
 Never ever seen you play no fool" 
 'Cause I use that microphone like a plumber use a tool 
 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, and 
 Baa baa black sheep was a little whore, 
 Can't run hack 'cause she gave herself some more, 
 Give her a dollar, to make her scream and holler 
 Put my head under the bar and she made me wanna call 
 Reachin' in my pocket, and pulled out my gun, 
 Shot her pimp in the head, motherfuckah fell dead, 
 But now she's in jail in a ten year bed, 
 (Scratching: That's- That's- That's- That's Fresh!) 
 Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time 
 For MC Schoolly D to start hummin' a rhyme, 
 I heard you was out there writin' my lines, 
 And if I catcha boy, yo' ass is mine 
 You always in my face sayin' "Schoolly School, man 
 How the fuck didja get so cool, man, 
 Never ever seen you play no fool" 
 'Cause I use that microphone like a plumber use a tool
