 We are the Mooninites, this is who we be 
 Just like the old school rapper Schooly D 
 Mooninite 1, you're a hard rap singer

 Check it out y'all, check it check it out 
 Check it out y'all, check it check it out 
 Don't be afraid when I turn the party out 
 'Cause I come from the Moon and I carry all the clout 
 I got a quad lazah, it will amaze ya 
 My gizzat is izzat, so won't you just step back 
 Check it out y'all, check it check it out 
 Check it out y'all, check it check it out 
 Hear that, Mooninites, and you know that we're back 
 Everybody else in the house know that they wack 
 Three in the morn, I'm lookin' for the porn 
 Know that we freeze, so get on your kness 
 Check it out y'all, check it check it out 
 Check it out y'all, check it check it out
