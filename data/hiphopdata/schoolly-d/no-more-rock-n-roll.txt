Yo man yo yo 
 Fuck Cinderella, fuck Bon Jovi and motherfuck Prince, man 
 This is rap 
 We've got something for all in rap (that lives around (?) 
 We've got something 
 Yeah, check this shit out 
 No more rock N roll 
 No more fucking rock N roll 
 That's right y'all 
 I'm a hell of a man 
 I walk down the street and I heard you say damn 
 I wanna be like Schoolly to 
 I make rap records and I say fuck you 
 Still homeboy I get respect 
 You can tell by the gold chain around my neck 
 You know whenever, ver ?? 
 Because I carry a gun by my side 
 Always got fly (?) in my ride 
 Sometimes oh yes I do get high 
 (?) 
 On the microphone I want rap 
 Fucking rollers step fuck back 
 No more rock N roll 
 No more fucking rock N roll 
 Long haired freak get back on you bus/butts 
 Me and Code Money we're coming to rush 
 Rock N Roller, we've taking over 
 Stand on stage ... and ... 
 You faggots get out of my face 
 I punch you out man what a disgrace 
 My name's Schoolly D on the microphone 
 No more rock N roll 
 No more fucking rock N roll
