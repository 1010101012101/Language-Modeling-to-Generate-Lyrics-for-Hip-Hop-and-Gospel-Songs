(Sound of heart beating) 
 Yo man 
 Yo man, what's up? 
 What's your worst nightmare? 
 Is this it? 
 (Steps are heard) 
 - Yo hus, I like the 8Ball jacket 
 - Yeah yo, it's dope, give it up, sucker 
 - Nah man... nah man 
 [Brawl ensues 
 Shots are fired 
 Body drops 
 Heartbeat sounds stop 
 Flatline is heard] 
 (Hey yeah 
 Hey, hey yeah) 
 Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger [x3] 
 (Funkyeeee... yeah) 
 I said peace to a brother and then I shot him 
 I pulled away, I know that I got him 
 Then I rolled up the cheeba-cheeba 
 That's all a brother like me really needed 
 Why I did it, or really why I done it? 
 I don't know why, but the game, I run it 
 Thinkin' way back how the story was told 
 Gettin' (funkeeee) when I was 12 years old 
 I didn't give a damn about tyin no thether 
 All I needed was the nine millimeter 
 All my homies has been some thugs 
 To make a little money we sold a little drugs 
 PSK, just makin' that big green 
 A rough brother at the age of 16 
 But nowadays I'm a dope rap singer 
 Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger 
 (Funkyeeee... yeah) 
 Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger [x4] 
 A shoe-shine nigga I never will be 
 When you gonna ever let a brother be free? 
 What up with that (funkeeee) that I see 
 When I turn on my TV? 
 'Cause if you think a young brother really care 
 About a brother livin' in Bel Air 
 Hell no, I'm straight from the ghetto 
 Smoke a little weed just to stay a little mellow 
 A Asiatic blackman, you understand 
 Because I'm rich you think that I'm a dopeman 
 I hear your laughter every time that I say that 
 But you won't laugh when I pull on the git-gat 
 You rather see me pickin' yo cotton 
 Than a young blackman clickin and clockin 
 G's, 'cause I'm a dope rap singer 
 Your worst nightmare a young gangbanger 
 (Funkyeeee... yeah) 
 Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger [x4] 
 (Sucker) 
 (Funkyeeee) 
 (Hey yeah) 
 (Funkyeeee... yeah) 
 (Hey yeah) 
 (Scratching of) 
 (Funkeeee)

 Listen up, hard teachin go down from the wild side 
 School didn't do it, so what, gotta try 
 Crime - in this game yourself that's all you got 
 If you're soft, hard, the most times end up smooth shot 
 So now you're deep, you're down 
 Clear the line one time to trip and slip 
 And when you slip you're slidin right to a grave 
 You shoulda learned at school cause the drugs made you a slave 
 (Yeah) sucker 
 (Scratching of) 
 (Funkeeee) 
 (Hey yeah) 
 (Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger) 
 (Scratching of) 
 (Funkeeee) 
 (Hey yeah)
