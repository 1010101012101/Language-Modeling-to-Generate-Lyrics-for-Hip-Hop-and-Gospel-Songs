My age is young, my money is green 
 I shot ? lady with my gangster lean 
 Well Dave cut the record down to the bone 
 They always got me rocking on the microphone 
 Come on young lady, cool out and chill 
 Check my man out on the wheels of steel 
 Because the law rhymes with law 
 And you see young lady dancing on the floor 
 'Cause you sucker emcees, trying to cut my ryhme 
 Got the girls downtown, standing in the line 
 Got the ? president, trying to shake my hand 
 Got the number to you girl, and trying to land 
 Got an office downtown, with secretary brown 
 Girls and girls, hanging all around 
 Got the cheeba and the black, dub cat alat 
 ? ? ? 
 Young lady, don't be shady 
 Come and take a ride in my Mercedes 
 Up to downtown, all around the world 
 I love to see young fly girl 
 With their hair so long, skin so divine 
 You listen to me to say this emcee rhyme 
 Car and the Jane, was sitting in the tree 
 F U C K I N and a G 
 Emcee X6 
 On the corner, selling some weed 
 And then came along, a sucker emcee 
 Say, yo Holmes, what's up with that? 
 And can I cop me, a nickel bag? 
 I said, a nickel bag, is Ninety Nine
