 I could see millions, billions 
 Foreigns, all that 
 I could see myself getting a lot of money 
 I could see the condo, Miami 
 I could see me in the sports cars 
 On 16 shots of brown at the sports bar 
 At 16, I was hiding report cards 
 Now I see myself getting where I'm going, no On Star 
 GPS for that money, got the directions 
 Monday night hit the strip joint and cop a section 
 Niggas ain't fighting no more, we got some weapons 
 Do it for the culture, I really come from the essence 
 Essence magazine, brown skin 
 Cousin from the heights, she told me got some pounds and 
 Said he out in Brooklyn, he be back up town around ten 
 Mad traffic in the crib going through it where housin' 
 If I get evicted, play my bitch crib 
 You don't want no drama, niggas pop up where your kids live 
 Set up where your wife work 
 I be dressed like I'm just coming to see if your lights work 
 Shooter do it just 'cause he love me, nigga that's light work 
 I see me in that ghost with a lot of smoke 
 I see me getting low if you gotta go 
 I see me in that foreign 
 See me with that Gucci umbrella when it's pouring 
 That's how I see it 
 I see me with connects from the motherland 
 Backwood in my left, pistol in my other hand 
 I see me on the Forbes list, see me in them Porsches 
 Still rocking all white Forces 
 Nas 
 I rock tuxes, busters 
 Clusters cover my watches 
 Drop mustard color, foreign cars in garages 
 Only queens I fuck with Celine clutches 
 My bitch bullet holes in my foes 
 Side chick got a side chick 
 Hunter green Nikes, they don't like me 
 I see niggas cuffing their lady when they sight me 
 Backwood blowing, 'Yack be pouring 
 Benjamin Button nasty Don, rich milly on the arm 
 Been literally rich since '96 
 Still would've hit my enemies with a tech in 9 six 
 Exotic materials on the neck and fly whips 
 I was fresh out the 'jects, decked out to def 
 Y'all witnessed it, I could fill you in 
 Real millionaire shit, escargot front lawn like a dealership 
 Who I rep, 10th street, twelfth street 
 Plus the Vernon family and that's word to Yam 
 You see me in that ghost with a lot of smoke 
 I see me getting low if you gotta go 
 You see me in my foreign 
 See me with that Margiela umbrella when it's pouring 
 That's how I see it 
 I see me with connects from the motherland 
 Backwood in the left, cash in my other hand 
 See I'm truer than the Forbes list, see me in them Porsches 
 Still rocking them '84 Jordans 
 Dave East 
 I see me in Dubai, me and Buda high 
 Moving pies I still see his mother through the sky 
 I see tan lines, models, haters be anti 
 I was smoking gram downs, playing foster with franchise 
 I see myself in that GQ magazine 
 I was low, nobody in the streets knew I had a fiend 
 He had a green Honda Civic, parked it on my block 
 I could drive it for days just made sure you had a rock 
 Waking up smoking kush, I could see the envy 
 Weed and Henny, that's the reason this evil in me 
 I want it all, I ain't letting 'em keep a penny 
 I see me slumped in that Bentley bumping the best of Biggie 
 Shouts to Philly, I see me and Freaky laughing 
 I see Nut in a Porch, I see a Lil' in a Aston 
 I could see the city from a penthouse view 
 Married streets, the avenue just said "I do" 
 I see me in that ghost with a lot of smoke 
 I see me getting low if you gotta go 
 I see me in that foreign 
 See me with that Gucci umbrella when it's pouring 
 That's how I see it 
 I see me with connects from the motherland 
 Backwood in my left, pistol in my other hand 
 I see me on the Forbes list, see me in them Porsches 
 Still rocking all white Forces 
 It's just how I see myself 
 Ask me how I see them, I see myself in five years 
 Rich nigga, fuck you think 
 That's how I see it
