I got niggas that's never coming home 
 Bitches say they love my music, don't know none of my songs 
 I guess poverty changed me, I was a decent kid 
 I was rece' in bed, I had a dream I could speak to Big 
 Harlem, ain't nowhere like it 
 I fell in love with new records 'cause all my homies liked it 
 Chick from parole was light-skinned 
 She got my bro indicted 
 Now he up north, I write him 
 Trust me I know the prices 
 Looked at my homie lifeless 
 I need some shit I can feel, nobody touch me 
 I say I'm meant to be here, the doctors say that I'm lucky 
 My cousin was a custy, he used to stick up to get high 
 He robbed a corner bodega on camera, had to sit five 
 Came home talking that jail shit 
 He got his weight up like niggas is frail 
 But still he just couldn't sell shit 
 Youngins got the block sewed up like rugby patches 
 They hate you when you go get it yourself, they love you askin' 
 Know you starving, they throw you rations 
 Wonder why his stomach grumbling 
 Shawty come from nothing, ain't never have shit 
 His father in the mountains, his mother just want a pill to make 
 The only motivation he ever had was to steal a bike 
 Something in his system was different, just wasn't feeling right 
 4AM phone call, his cousin got killed tonight 
 He tryna double back on the last time he heard his voice 
 Can't be indecisive, these streets will help you to learn your choice 
 Back to Bentleys, back to the trenches nigga 
 My digits bigger, I smoke with Nas and I build with Jigga 
 A true artist, you could never paint a realer picture 
 Convinced your sister to twist her, just had to spill some liquor 
 A new rapper, ask 'bout new rappers, I don't feel them niggas 
 I chill with women, they chill with niggas, they different niggas 
 In the field so long, these Timberlands, made a killing in them 
 I benefitted from plenty hitters, they still my niggas 
 When Master P was yelling ice cream man 
 My uncle got caught with nineteen grams 
 If you don't like me, damn 
 How you gon' hate me, I ain't had shit in the 'frigerator 
 Now it's royal silk from molded bread and spoiled milk 
 I know they gon' hate y'all 
 I know they gon' hate y'all 
 I know they gon' hate y'all 
 The time it took me to make it here 
 Tell me how the fuck I'ma make it fair for a hater 
 I know these niggas ain't playing fair 
 Murder let you know this shit is real and we can take it there 
 Can't afford them Jordans, had to take a pair 
 I done seen the toughest niggas freeze up 
 Hammer just left 'em shaking there 
 This shit feel like a lion tryna race a bear 
 You niggas'll never catch me, it's probably gon' take a year 
 Top ten, bitch I'm locked in, like Jamaican hair 
 Headshots, used to be a scope, I put a laser there 
 Put newspaper on the carpet, air who walking 
 I don't trust these voices talking or the walls in my apartment 
 It's getting darker, pistol under the parka 
 Imagine, pouring Fruity Pebbles and roaches fall out 
 Make you wanna go to court, shoot the judge before you walk out 
 Make you wanna eat a nigga food, just pull a fork out 
 I be doing push ups in my cell before I talk 'bout 
 Anything we involved in, criminal code 
 Ex-bitches ready for war, they some militant hoes 
 Coke in the flesh, this that shit you feel in your nose 
 You college niggas come see how it feel to chill with a pro 
 Could never compare, you don't know how it feel to be broke 
 Just tryna get high, niggas you feed and stealing your smoke 
 Can never punch her but when I fuck her she still can get choked 
 First verse was the struggle, I bubbled right off a ink ball 
 Eight ball with all black diamonds, I bet they hate y'all 
 That money, know they gon' hate y'all
