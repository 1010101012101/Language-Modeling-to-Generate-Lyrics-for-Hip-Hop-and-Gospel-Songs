Hov made me want to throw the diamond up 
 Nas made me want a QB chain 
 Noriega made me want to do Pharell beats 
 It's Dark and Hell is Hot 
 dropped and my mood changed 
 Hov made me want to throw the diamond up 
 Nas made me want a QB chain 
 Styles, Kiss, and Sheek had me in the street 
 50 Cent on repeat on the 2 train 
 The Hot Boys made me want to cop mad toys 
 Puffy had me wanting to be a bad boy 
 Biggie had me wanting to be a jackboy 
 Now it's nothing less than 220 on the dashboard 
 I was taught to give it to him if he asked for it 
 (?), your dreams shatter like a glass door 
 Knocking the chronic, we started gridin' gettin' bags off 
 Richie Porter, Azie had me wanting a black Porsche 
 Now we on college to get a better team 
 Skimpin' them baggies, I kept an extra gram 
 I told Impala "keep flying, I hope we never land" 
 "All I Need" word for word, I thought I was Method Man 
 Mary J Blige on repeat 
 Leave you dead on vacation, brought the 9 to the beach 
 I'm my own man, so I don't care what your boy think 
 DJ Whoo Kid had me feelin' I was Lloyd Banks 
 Hov made me want to throw the diamond up 
 Nas made me want a QB chain 
 Noriega made me want to do Pharell beats 
 It's Dark and Hell is Hot 
 dropped and my mood changed 
 Hov made me want to throw the diamond up 
 Nas made me want a QB chain 
 Styles, Kiss, and Sheek had me in the street 
 50 Cent on repeat on the 2 train 
 On the block, you ain't see it, bitch, you heard about it 
 I'm havin' conversations with Irv Gotti 
 No trappin' at momma house, I hit her lobby 
 Addicted to pain killers, think the Percs got me 
 Mase had me wanting to have my waves spinnin' 
 Too Short told me I should never ever pay women 
 Youngin' got money, they wonder why he stay grinnin' 
 Lately been feelin' like Jeter in the 8th inning 
 Derek, that is 
 On nights I would stare at my fridge with nothing there, thought I barely would live 
 Really goin' out my mind, don't know what therapy is 
 My hitters scarin' the kids killin' (?) 
 Nas told me they would rush, I'm prepared for the blitz 
 Rollin' cannabis, watching Ellen cannabis clips 
 What you want, a 50, a dime, gram, or a nick'? 
 M.O.P had me tellin' niggas "hand me your shit" 
 "Ante Up" 
 Hov made me want to throw the diamond up 
 Nas made me want a QB chain 
 Noriega made me want to do Pharell beats 
 It's Dark and Hell is Hot 
 dropped and my mood changed 
 Hov made me want to throw the diamond up 
 Nas made me want a QB chain 
 Styles, Kiss, and Sheek had me in the street 
 50 Cent on repeat on the 2 train 
 Pac made me think if I get shot I'ma keep standin' 
 Big Pun had me really wanting to speak Spanish 
 No more oodles and noodles, now we eat salmon 
 Damn, fifty voices in my head sayin' "Keep gambling" 
 I came up off that phone tap, Sosa 
 Escobar style, the fox brown for the culture 
 Momma had plastic on the sofa, Coogi wrap coasters 
 Had Fab on the poster 
 Hov made me want to throw the diamond up 
 Nas made me want a QB chain 
 Noriega made me want to do Pharell beats 
 It's Dark and Hell is Hot 
 dropped and my mood changed 
 Hov made me want to throw the diamond up
