 I've been tryna get all up in it 
 Gave you my card, I don't know 'bout no limit (swipe) 
 They can't see us in it, that foreign was tinted (oh) 
 Nowadays they get too borin' with niggas 
 In love with that pussy, adorin' these women (I love 'em) 
 Pull out some Molly, bet all of them with it 
 If I take you shoppin', make sure it's expensive (cash up) 
 Nothin' feel better than knowin' that pussy for me (mine) 
 I've been a wolf in these streets 
 I hold my own in it, ain't nobody took it from me (nobody) 
 I get women you wouldn't believe 
 Eye on that money, I'm gon' get high with your honey 
 Might take a trip out of the country 
 Know I got hoes, she not findin' it funny 
 Her brain is so good, I can't ride with no dummy 
 I only see you in Prada, not bummy 
 I'm from the streets, but your momma gon' love me 
 I told her, "I never run out of this money" 
 Fall back on your homies, a lot of them love me 
 It's 'bout to get ugly
