 We hustle smart (smart), never just wanted any cash (nah) 
 These niggas robbing from Pathmarks, stealing from Jimmy Jazz 
 Welcome to gangland, don't come without no visit pass (don't come)

 Made it out the jungle, came back in a Jaguar (Skrrt) 
 Shawty ass fat with a cat back 
 Check checks, so that straight cash (Now tell me you want it, eh) 
 Suit suit to that ski mask (Now tell me you want it, eh)

 Grams of crates (crates), brainstorm for the grand escape (escape)
