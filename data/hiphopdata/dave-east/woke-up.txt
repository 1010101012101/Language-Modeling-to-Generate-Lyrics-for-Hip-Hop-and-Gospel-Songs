 Doctor, I did a CAT scan on my brain this morning 
 And they found money on my mind, you dig 
 Tory Lanez & 
 Dave East 
 Woke up with some money on my mind ( 
 money 
 ) 
 Woke up with some money on my mind ( 
 money 
 ) 
 Woke up, counting hundreds all the time ( 
 count it up 
 ) 
 Woke up, eyes zoom in on my mind ( 
 money 
 ) 
 I said doctor ( 
 doctor 
 ), I need a CAT scan ( 
 me too 
 ) 
 Doctor, I need a CAT scan ( 
 me too 
 ) 
 Woke up with some money on my mind ( 
 run it up, run it up 
 ) 
 Woke up with some money on my mind ( 
 run it up, run it up

 I think 'bout this money, it got me 
 Fill my Backwood with biscotti 
 I'm Jordan, this paper be Scottie 
 Hope I don't catch me a body 
 Fifty thousand, it won't fit in no wallet 
 Public housing, we was stuck in them projects 
 Sixty-five, I can't drive a Bugatti 
 Fell out with the plug, I'm back in with Papi 
 Lambo truck is all I want to get 
 Forty drumming on some thunder shit 
 Rubber grip, it hold a hundred clip 
 I just fell out with another bitch 
 I'ma get back on the late night 
 I think I might need a CAT scan 
 Fifties and hundreds my x-ray 
 More green than when the Jets play 
 Overnight then work the next day 
 UPS or we can Fed Ex 
 I'm tryna make me some money with her 
 After that I get the head next 
 Thinking back when I was dead stressed 
 Selling dimes, two for fifteen 
 Three for twenty if I'm up already 
 She playin' with it, tryna fuck already

 My pistol is black, these hundreds is blue 
 I'm at the bank almost every day 
 See this shit on me, you know that it's true 
 I never gave a fuck, me and this paper stuck 
 This shit be feeling like glue 
 I Range-d the truck, how could I make this up 
 I'm just a nigga like you 
 I'm from the bottom where we gon' get money regardless 
 I'm not no regular artist 
 FN, this bitch came with a cartridge 
 I had that butter shit, I called it margarine 
 Now I make more than my teachers 
 I bet I black out on all of my features 
 Broke, I call my cousin for sneakers 
 Smoke, they don't want none of that neither 
 Valor sweats like it's '89 
 Me and Tory on some shit again 
 She talk about me like a cornball 
 Knowin' she gon' let me hit again 
 Militant, from the trenches, I can count up a million 
 Tryna wake up on an island like Gilligan 
 All of this money wrap me and my innocence
