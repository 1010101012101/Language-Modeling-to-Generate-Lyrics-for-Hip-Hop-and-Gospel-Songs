I did a lot but I never hated 
 Never hated 
 Did a lot but I never hated 
 We throw the money up 
 We throw the money up 
 I did a lot but I never hated 
 We throw the money up 
 We throw the money up 
 Strapped with my driver 
 You know there's no running up 
 You go against the family you dumb or what? 
 I'm bout to fuck four or five summers up 
 She got that waist trainer on her waist 
 Told that bitch go get a tummy tuck 
 Wake up, I'm smoking dope everyday 
 I hit the bank that's a money run 
 Baby girl chew me like bubble gum 
 I do not wanna smoke blunts with them 
 On them late nights pray the sun will come 
 Double dutching bitches jumping us 
 Polo on me, lot of horse power 
 Past women I am done with them 
 Baggin up in front my little brother 
 I ain't wanna do that shit in front of him 
 Niggas tell me that I'm going nuts 
 Ask your bitch, she just was holdin' those 
 You put Gucci all up on her clothes 
 When it come to this she probably overdose 
 Waited long enough we on it now 
 No more hoopin' but I'm balling now 
 Got 'em in they feelings, I don't call 'em now 
 I'm just tryna get it foreign tryna whip it 
 Neiman Marcus went like 20 on 'em 
 Shout to Trigga, had the Bentley for me 
 Remember I ain't have a penny on me 
 If it's not Buscemi, classic Penny's on me 
 Walking like I got a milli on me 
 I did a lot but I never hated 
 My man home so we celebrating 
 I'm in a condo with a elevator 
 My mind blowed, I'm just elevating 
 I've been on a different type of time 
 I've been on a different type of time 
 I did a lot but I ain't never hated 
 My man home so we celebrating 
 I'm laying up countin' hella paper 
 Got her goin' down, I'm just levitating 
 I've been on a different type of time 
 I've been on a different type of time 
 I'm tearing Louis down 
 I'm tearing Fendi down 
 I'm hot, that's a Fendi now 
 Jacket say Fendi now 
 Won't pay for no verses 
 I smoke in the back of that Bentley now 
 I did not have a lot 
 We did not have a lot 
 Like how was they upset with Biggie? 
 How was they mad at Pac? 
 I ain't have a crib but I had a Glock 
 I had the plug and Black had the pot 
 I want the world, you can have the block 
 Jump out a Porsche with the baddest thot 
 Remember I was tryna pay the cop 
 In and out the back of patty wagons 
 Pockets probably pack a lot of salad, I 
 Cameras in it helped me back it out 
 Prince of my city, what's that about 
 They heard I could spit, tryna rap it out 
 They reach out they hands tryna dap it out 
 I go in my zone and I'm blacking out 
 We traveling, Wayno just map it out 
 I got my boarding pass 
 I just want all the cash 
 What's better than that? 
 I think of hoopty, that Jetta was black 
 That broke shit was whack 
 I'll never go back 
 I did a lot but I never hated 
 My man home so we celebrating 
 I'm in a condo with a elevator 
 My mind blowed, I'm just elevating 
 I've been on a different type of time 
 I've been on a different type of time 
 I did a lot but I ain't never hated 
 My man home so we celebrating 
 I'm laying up countin' hella paper 
 Got her goin' down, I'm just levitating 
 I've been on a different type of time 
 I've been on a different type of time 
 I did a lot but I never hated 
 My man home so we celebrating 
 I'm in a condo with a elevator 
 My mind blowed, I'm just elevating 
 I've been on a different type of time 
 I've been on a different type of time 
 I did a lot but I ain't never hated 
 My man home so we celebrating 
 I'm laying up countin' hella paper 
 Got her goin' down, I'm just levitating 
 I've been on a different type of time 
 I've been on a different type of time
