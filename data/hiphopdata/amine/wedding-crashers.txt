I was duped, didn't know the truth 
 Got rid of my old flame, now I got a boo 
 And now I'm feeling cool, I'm feeling brand new 
 I would pay a lot to be the nigga in my shoes (Who this for?) 
 This is dedicated to my ex lovers

 Hope you play this at your wedding 
 Yeah, the one I won't attend

 Vultures at the altar tell the pastor to watch his back 
 My girl said she wanted change and then she got a quarterback 
 Well, damn, I ain't no football player 
 But I hit it harder than a football player 
 The girl of my dreams just became a girl 
 And well, we can talk about that later 
 Honeymoon in your hometown, bitch, you broke now 
 Your mama ask about me almost every week 
 He can speak in tongue, talking bout "Forever hold your peace" 
 I said peace, please hurry up and kiss so I can eat, mmm 
 Tootsie roll and your tippy toes 
 So much soul that my soul got soul 
 Your auntie and uncle, they love me 
 All your bridesmaids wanna fuck me 
 Your groom look like a broom and it make me "hahaha"

 Whole party lit, bad bitches everywhere 
 Gang in this bitch, nawfside extraordinaire (gang!) 
 Pipe up the city, the diamonds gon' light up the city 
 I got your girl on the low 
 I slide in it, and then I'ma dodge in it 
 I got her selling her soul 
 Pick up five bags in a row 
 White diamonds look like the Pope 
 Gucci Python on the loafers 
 Yeah, my pinky look just like the ocean 
 It's colder, North Dakota 
 From the bowl to the chauffeurs 
 Having fun in a Rollster, in Milan copping Goyard 
 Now that I'm taking over, your hand out, but I don't owe ya 
 I came from the dirt, soil 
 I was duped, didn't know the truth
