Pass me the lighter 
 Old flame calling so she wanna light the fire 
 Now I'm super tired 
 When we get together, room sound like a choir 
 I'm a true lifer 
 Pussy make me happy and it make me inspired 
 Forget to read on my Bible 
 Go through these cycles, so... 
 I was up in the night 
 It never was known 
 I wanted to try 
 But I wasn't sure 
 My life was a lie 
 I filled it with gold 
 There wasn't a night 
 Where I wasn't sure 
 Now pass me the lighter 
 Old flame calling so she wanna light the fire 
 Now I'm super tired 
 When we get together, room sound like a choir 
 Yeah, I'm a true lifer 
 Pussy make me happy and it make me inspired 
 Forget to read on my Bible 
 Only God know why I go through these cycles 
 I was up in the night 
 It never was known 
 I wanted to try 
 But I wasn't sure 
 My life was a lie 
 I filled it with gold 
 There wasn't a night 
 Where I wasn't sure 
 Shit, bitch I'm dripped in gold (woo)

 Quit my 9 to 5, now I'm 95 degrees 
 Destined for my destiny 
 I sow no hate or jealousy 
 Niggas feel me like Hennessy 
 And if it's good for you 
 Then it's good for me (true) 
 Destined in my density 
 I only show love or empathy 
 'Cause karma dictates my legacy 
 And if it's good for you 
 Then it's good for me
