 I got the baddest bitch 
 Shorty keep hollerin' at me 
 Told her I'm a young OG from the west 
 And I'm repping up the 503 
 I ain't no average bitch 
 Baby come swing my way 
 Imma put you on this game 
 Get it all gas no breaks (skrrt) 
 Aminé 
 & 
 Kehlani 
 Just for you I might jeopardize 
 My whole life I might sacrifice 
 Way you look is like whoa (whoa) 
 Got me locked and I'm hypnotized 
 Shakira-like and these hips don't lie 
 Say I don't but I always try 
 Way you look is like whoa 
 Got me locked and I'm hypnotized 
 Aminé 
 & 
 Kehlani 
 You, you got so much potential 
 Every moment spent with you 
 I bet was always eventful 
 I've never seen your type of species 
 Give me heebiejeebies 
 Attitude Khaleesi 
 Whoa, and I'm like whoa whoa whoa 
 You, you got so much potential 
 Every moment spent with you 
 I bet was always eventful 
 I've never seen your type of species 
 Give me heebiejeebies 
 Attitude Khaleesi 
 Whoa, and I'm like whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Kehlani 
 Don't you know you're something else? 
 Don't you know that there's no one else? 
 Must I remind you? 
 Real ones behind you 
 Don't look, I'm gonna find you 
 Kehlani 
 So, just for you I might jeopardize 
 My whole life I might sacrifice 
 Baby got me like whoa 
 Hypnotize 'em like whoa 
 Shakira-like and these hips don't lie 
 Say I don't but I always try 
 Cause baby lookin' like whoa 
 Whoa...

 Took my time, now I start to see signs 
 In too deep now I can't rewind 
 Lil mama she gonna work out 
 When she do the Bowflex then we have more sex 
 Sweat, drippin, now I wanna kick it 
 Cheated on you with some dumb bum bitches 
 Your momma wouldn't be too proud 
 Girl we in public, don't be too loud 
 Sugar pie, Aminé never tell no lies 
 Love and lust it's just both of us 
 I'd rather talk to you to get by 
 I don't really play no games 
 Unless it's with my friends and we playing 2k 
 Baby I'm on one, I'm here for the long run (with you)
