I'm standin on the bridge 
 I'm waitin in the dark 
 I thought that you'd be here, by now 
 There's nothin' but the rain 
 No footsteps on the ground 
 I'm listening but there's, no sound 
 Isn't anyone trying to find me? 
 Won't somebody come take me home? 
 It's a damn cold night 
 Trying to figure out this life 
 Won't you take me by the hand take me somewhere new 
 Don't know who you are but I, I'm with you 
 I'm with you 
 I'm looking for a place 
 I'm searchin for a face 
 Is anybody here, I know? 
 'Cause nothin's going right 
 And everything's a mess 
 And no one likes to be alone 
 How come everything's so confusing? 
 Maybe I'm just out of my mind?
