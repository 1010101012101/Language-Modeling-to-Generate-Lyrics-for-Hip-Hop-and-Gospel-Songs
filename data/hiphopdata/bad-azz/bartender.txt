Ain't nothing working ain't nothing right 
 There's a whole in me that I can't fill 
 No matter how hard I try 
 Hey bartender hit me with a double 
 And introduce me to that girl with the bubble 
 I'm looking for trouble tonight 
 No momma don't trust me tonight 
 You be the center baby 
 I'd be the quarterback 
 Hike hit the tailback 
 Watch it on playback 
 Jah smash that hitting that redbone 
 Up in the endzone biting on the collarbone 
 I just want your company 
 I just want you to comfort me just come with me 
 Hey bartender hit me with another 
 I just about had to kill this brother 
 Shit I'm looking for trouble tonight 
 You be the beauty - baby 
 I'd be the beast 
 Who gives a fuck take it to the bedroom 
 Take it the streets 
 Take it like a man muthafucker 
 Yo bitch chose me muthafucker 
 I just want your company 
 I just want you to comfort me just come with me 
 I just want your company 
 I just want you to comfort me just come with me 
 Take me there take me with you 
 I can't be alone tonight 
 I can't be alone tonight 
 I can't trust myself tonight 
 I can't trust myself tonight 
 Baby please don't trust me tonight 
 No please don't trust me tonight 
 Ain't nothing working 
 Ain't nothing right 
 There's a whole in me that I can't fill 
 No matter how hard I try 
 Ain't nothing sweeter there ain't nothing wrong 
 All the pain that I receive keeps me strong 
 It keeps me moving on 
 I just want your company 
 I want you to comfort me just come with me 
 I just want your company 
 I want you to comfort me just come with me I just want your company 
 I want you to comfort me just come with me 
 Comfort me Just come with me 
 Comfort me Just come with me
