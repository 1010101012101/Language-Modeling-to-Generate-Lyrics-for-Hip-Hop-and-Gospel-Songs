This is my last sh, my last shit? 
 Uh, it definitely be mad important 
 Ay man, that sound like a Prince song 
 Still a chain smoking, name dropping 
 Good looking, motherfucking 
 Mother, shut your mouth 
 Still a chain smoking, name dropping 
 Good looking, motherfucking 
 Mother, shut your mouth 
 Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening 
 Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping 
 Paint dripping, mother shut your mouth 
 Somebody pray for the god, oh Lord, I wonder what Michael's on 
 Son jammin' to his shit, rappin', trappin', trippin' 'cid and sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin 
 Shoulda died yelling, "YOLO was a lie and you a liar, wonder why you wanna die so young" 
 You and I look just alike and I'm afraid that this one right here might be last time that I write a song 
 Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang but I ain't tryna go out at all 
 So I ain't tryna go out at all got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door 
 Last chance joint gotta be a dance joint from an introspective drugged out standpoint 
 Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint, old school for my own old man joint 
 Still a chain smoking, name dropping 
 Good looking, motherfucking 
 Mother, shut your mouth 
 Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening 
 Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping 
 Paint dripping, mother shut your mouth 
 This part right here, right now, right here, this part my shit 
 I play this so loud in the car, I forget to park my whip 
 I lean back, then spark my shit, I turn up, I talk my shit 
 Hope you love all of my shit, I hope you love all of my shit, igh 
 Why toss my filter when she saved my life? 
 The same shit that kills us, always taste so right 
 That's why I pray to the dealer, God know who he be 
 Truth be told he juiced me, introduced me to the lucy leaf 
 Oh oh oh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter 
 Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier 
 Lies, Levis on fire, flyer on the wall I'm brighter 
 In the darkness of the night, in the sky I get higher, higher 
 Still a chain smoking, name dropping 
 Good looking, motherfucking 
 Mother, shut your mouth 
 Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening 
 Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping 
 Paint dripping, mother shut your mouth 
 This part right here, right now, right here, this part my shit 
 I play this so loud in the car, I forget to park my whip 
 I lean back, then spark my shit, I turn up, I talk my shit 
 Hope you love all of my shit, I hope you love all of my shit 
 Still a chain smoking, name dropping 
 Good looking, motherfucking 
 Mother, shut your mouth 
 Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening 
 Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping 
 Paint dripping, mother shut your mouth, igh
