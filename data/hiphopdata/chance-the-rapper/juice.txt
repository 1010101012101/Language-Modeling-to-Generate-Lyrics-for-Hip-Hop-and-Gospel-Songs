Thirsty, thirsty, tryna choose 
 I mean I know, I'm pretty cool 
 My nitty bag, my kitty boost 
 I got the juice, I got the juice 
 Chano, Chatham's own 
 Foolies glad I'm home 
 Even my haters kinda glad I'm on 
 Rest In Peace to my Vagabond 
 Rapper song, singer, suspended, subpoena 
 For misdemeanors, dreamer, held back ass is lowkey still a senior 
 And I still shake up BO Squad, praying for my BraBois 
 City on the Come Up, shout that nigga Sosa 
 Shout my nigga Fat Trel, shout my nigga Joseph 
 Playing Buenos Aires while they sleepin' buenas noches 
 Wonder if I wrote this 'cause it's so crisp 
 The most brokest cold stock broker winter solstice 
 I could win an Oscar, Russian accent husky 
 Acid addict, costly avid actor, Kevin Costner (Ah, turn up, turn up) 
 Juice, (Juice), Juice, (Juice) 
 Juice, (Juice), Juice, (Juice) 
 I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup) 
 Juice, (Juice), Juice, (Juice) 
 Juice, (Juice), Juice, (Juice) 
 I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup) 
 God give me one sentence more 
 Maybe I just gotta get suspended more? 
 Hash tag it, get mentions for it 
 Make you love it, get it trending more 
 And then act humble 
 Hear some bull that some dude mumble 
 Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga punk you 
 Knowin' bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles, igh 
 But I love y'all souls 
 Don't let the juice spill Pac 
 Blue pill pop till you feel good enough to pop the popped bitch in the blue heels yop 
 That one, drown in the juice nigga 
 Hunnid proof get found in a youth nigga 
 Stop with all the tryna introduce nigga 
 Everybody know you dude you the new nigga 
 Hows it feel to be you? Yo no s√© 
 I ain't really been myself since Rod passed 
 I ain't even really need that shop class 
 I ain't really been weak since pops smashed 
 I'm a genius, a motherfuckin' pop smash 
 Hit sensei, master 
 Jack and Lindsey, Wiley, Kembe 
 Been paid, 10 Day been they FAFSA 
 Juice, (Juice), Juice, (Juice) 
 Juice, (Juice), Juice, (Juice) 
 I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup) 
 Juice, (Juice), Juice, (Juice) 
 Juice, (Juice), Juice, (Juice) 
 I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup) 
 Jugo, you never tasted paper 
 Tripped, racing yaself trynna chase the paper, I just faced a Vega 
 And you love being Kobe when you make the lay up 
 Till you realize everybody in the world fuckin hates the Lakers, hahaha 
 And then everybody wanna sip 
 Til the juice spill everybody want a bib 
 And then everybody wanna dip 
 Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth 
 All you can do is spit a verse of the truth 
 Merge the mixture with the purest and the fruits (I got the juice) 
 And the thirst, just the worst, it's the curse of the juice (I got the juice) 
 Juice, (Juice), Juice, (Juice) 
 Juice, (Juice), Juice, (Juice) 
 I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup) 
 Juice, (Juice), Juice, (Juice) 
 Juice, (Juice), Juice, (Juice) 
 I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup) 
 Thirsty, thirsty, tryna choose (Juice, juice, juice, juice) 
 I mean I know, I'm pretty cool (Yup) 
 My nitty bag, my kitty boost (Juice, juice, juice, juice) 
 I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup) 
 (Juice, juice, juice, juice) 
 Yup 
 (Juice, juice, juice, juice) 
 Yup 
 Yup, yup
