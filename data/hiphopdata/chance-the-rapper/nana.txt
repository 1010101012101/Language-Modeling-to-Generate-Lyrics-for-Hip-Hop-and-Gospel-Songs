Introducin' Chance the Ruthless, trip 'shrooms and lucy 
 Dreams is lucid, loosely based on music 
 Swallow my mucus, hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus 
 Deuces douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (Bang) 
 Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha 
 They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit 
 They use of illusion could confuse Confucius 
 Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing till my voice get raspy, last week suspended 
 Last night kissed Va$htie, parleyed with Ashley 
 Always in the hallway, so I never been classy, shut up 
 Na na na, na na na 
 Na na na, na na na 
 Na na na, na na na 
 (Igh, igh, igh, igh) 
 Acid acid, get it? Acid 
 Melts through plastic, I spit fired 
 Pad my palette, talkin' paper 
 If this was work, I'd get hired 
 Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered 
 Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with jack 
 Lickety-split, lickety-slipped on a shell 
 From peelin' banana split backs, give me my Kit-Kat 
 Don't break me off shit, batch, fuck is you mean bitch? 
 Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch 
 Zen with that chakra, I eat it like Idi Amin, you know what I mean 
 Hit me back when that mean shit 
 Na na na, na na na 
 Na na na, na na na 
 Na na na, na na na 
 Action Bronson: 
 Introducin', it's Bronsonlino 
 With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino 
 Three Japanese dykes in my El Camino 
 Lettin' trees blow, oh, I rep the East Coast 
 I got a team of hoes like Pat Summit 
 I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer (Get to the chopper) 
 I splash summer like a fast brother 
 With a number on his back, ain't no fumblin', in fact, I'm 
 Back, acid in my hat, shoot then pass the gat 
 It's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag 
 My new shorty got a gymnastic bag 
 87 that move green on a classic jag 
 She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef's salad 
 She had the club foot with that little arm 
 I couldn't help but laugh, she ordered chicken parm 
 I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on 
 Chance The Rapper and Action Bronson: 
 Na na na, na na na 
 Na na na, na na na 
 Na na na, na na na 
 (Suck my motherfucking dick 
 It's the young Randy Velarde 
 Queens, baby, oh) 
 Na na na, na na na 
 Na na na, na na na 
 (Blow me)
