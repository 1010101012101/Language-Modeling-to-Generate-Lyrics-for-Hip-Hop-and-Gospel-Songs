Ken Bennett and Chance The Rapper: 
 Well I should have you hooked up next week 
 (It's all good or whatever, I can wait till my birthday, I uh) 
 No, no, no, no, I told ya, I know you need it now, so next week I promise you I'll have you hooked up, okay? 
 (Oh, alright, I just wanted to say thank you for everything 
 For the computer, the T-shirts, and all the other stuff) 
 You know, Chance, let me tell you something 
 You know, I could never be more proud of anything in my life, you know, than I am of you and what you've done 
 Chance, you have done remarkable and wondrous things, so you don't have to tell me thank you for anything 
 I'm supposed to do this, that stuff for you anyway, and ya know, just keep doing what you're doing 
 I am very, very proud of you 
 Just keep doing what you're doing, okay? 
 (Thank you, love you) 
 Alright, son, love you too, take care 
 (Alright, bye bye 
 Thanks for coming guys) 
 Chance The Rapper: 
 'Member sittin' in class the first time listening to Dilla 
 Everything's good 
 Rubbin' on yo chin sippin gin, Margiela brand chinchilla 
 Everything's good 
 My manager backpack packed with packs of cigarillos 
 And some fruit snacks and some killer 
 Phone numbers on speed dial, call them save monkey guerillas 
 Everything's good 
 I ain't really that good at goodbyes, I ain't really that bad at leaving 
 I ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin' 
 Runnin' through purses even persons leave 'em hurtin', bleedin' 
 I ain't really help the helpless, I used to be worse than worthless 
 Now I'm worth hooks and verses, I'm good like books in churches 
 Harolds and Hooks and Church's, everything's good 
 See my name when you Google search it, use a card when I make a purchase 
 Everything's good 
 But I knew it was fly when I was just a caterpillar 
 That I'd make it even if I never make a milla 
 When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin' 
 And everything's good 
 I ain't really that good at good night, I ain't really that bad at sleepin' 
 With bad bitches, put them aside, I used to be thirsty creeping 
 Now I'm out working evenings birthdays even Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, weekends 
 Rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events 
 Damn, it feel good to be a gangsta and it feel good for me to thank ya 
 Put money back in your bank account 
 Off of songs I barely could think up 'cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up 
 Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound 
 I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo 
 Thanks Justin, lending them pencils 
 Mr. Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto, the time I beat Chris on Nintendo 
 Nanana hey hey, good intro 
 Remember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thriller 
 Remember the first time you heard this dude and thought, "Damn that's that nigga" 
 Hahaha, everything's good 
 I'm gonna be 
 I'm gonna be 
 Juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke, juke

 Juke, juke, juke, juke (Bang bang bang, skeet skeet skeet)
