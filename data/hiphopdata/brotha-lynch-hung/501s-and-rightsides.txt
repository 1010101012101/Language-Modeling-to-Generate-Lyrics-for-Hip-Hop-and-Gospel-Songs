No matter what set you bangin', nigga, better get it right 
 Better not be light cause niggas is out there for your life 
 Don't believe it, that's your problem, time to solve it 
 You can be the shooter, I be the one to get your jaw split 
 No matter what set you bangin', nigga, better get it right 
 Better not be light cause niggas is out there for your life 
 Don't believe it, that's your problem, time to solve it 
 You can be the shooter, I be the one to get your jaw split 
 I'm from where most people hardly reach adulthood 
 Poverty stricken 
 Look odd and they go approach you 
 Obviously a notion to rob you of what you holdin' 
 Probably be them soldiers 
 Can spot 'em 'cause the cloakin, scopin 
 In them 501s, hawkin 
 Them red bandanas fallin' 
 Out the right side them pockets 
 These niggas is bangin' so watch it 
 You know them 5's is poppin' 
 And they say them 6's is droppin' 
 When bullets flyin' 
 If you ain't 'bout it, stay home 
 Thanks to the street the next time see you is 
 Especially if you 
 Maybe a little crazy 
 No matter what set you bangin', nigga, better get it right 
 Better not be light cause niggas is out there for your life 
 Don't believe it, that's your problem, time to solve it 
 You can be the shooter, I be the one to get your jaw split 
 You youngin niggas is stupid 
 Family will be in ruins 
 Niggas been through it before ya 
 Ain't no 
 Obituaries and memories 
 Grew up avengeful and now you got genocide in the makin' 
 And that's just how we all endin' up 
 That's all we know 
 No matter what set you bangin', nigga, better get it right 
 Better not be light cause niggas is out there for your life 
 Don't believe it, that's your problem, time to solve it 
 You can be the shooter, I be the one to get your jaw split
