This songs dedicated to them niggaz bumpin gums and talkin' shit behind a nigga back 
 Knowing I can't defend myself (if you trippin') 
 Oh if you trippin'(That's real) then it must be you I'm tallkin' 'bout 
 (Don't trip) and if it ain't you don't trip 
 (Verse 1 BLH) 
 Drop niggaz like bad habits that's the truth 
 Mothafucka be runnin' around actin' like they bulletproof 
 How could I trust you wouldn't bust 2 slugs for me 
 Talkin' 'bout you thug homie you really ain't got love for me 
 Anyway what you do for me Nuttin' 
 You wouldn't let the forty-five keep buccin 
 What you tslkin anbout in your stuff 
 You don't live nowhere near gangsta street 
 And if I wanted to I'd take out sum of teeth 
 And for the rest of my life have beef and 
 You know what I do wit meat (meat) 
 Know to cheat creep from the bacc of the Cadillac Seville 
 Pull out the strap and attack the vel 
 And if it don't happen I'm goin' to keep doin' musicc and talkin' shit 
 About you never even mention your name 'cause 
 It'll come out you a bitch-ass nigga you live you life all secluded 
 And if I wasn't around you wouldn;t do shit 
 Talkin' you jacc nigaaz put'em in the bacc witta blue rag around they snuggle 
 Used to have a huddle of Siccmade niggaz and know its only me that rumble 
 Eat'em up like gumbo (don't trip) how could I know I was so comfortable you took advantage of the whole 
 Situation all that shit you makin' it was 'cause of me we was cool for all those years 
 But I was blind and couldn't see 
 There it is 
 Another nigga went ballstic on me 
 Couldn't have his way so I guess he turned his bacc on me 
 And if he didn't I'm just tired of shit 
 I rather do it on my own do it all alone he was dipped X2 
 This sum fake nigga pain how could I knew it fat supply of licca fluid 
 Some green leaves that stank up the whole house that how we had it 
 Everyday make sure my niggaz was drunk and high in every eway 
 3 O'lock in the morin come home drunk and fall out 
 I didn't give a fucc they was my homies I went all out 
 Then I found out must of them fake like 
 Van-Damme 
 They know about the game but couldn't bracc a damn can 
 Wit hollow tips in they hands so I jucc'em like a cracc sacc 
 Make 'em fill hella bad make sure they never coming bacc 
 They show me too much shit I couldn't take it couldn't make it 
 Another year dealin' wit all this fake shit nigga yeah 
 And nigga I'm tired of you spyin on me kiccin it wit that other mothafucca 
 That be lyin' on me why homie I thought me and you was untouchable 
 You be tellin' everybody what you know so bye homie 
 There it is 
 Another nigga went ballstic on me 
 Didn't think I loved him so I guess he turned his bacc on me 
 And if he didn't I'm just tired of shit 
 I rather do it on my own do it all alone he was dipped X2 
 This sum weak nigga sauce the kind you put on spaghetti 
 I'm a kicc bacc nigga but I'm armed and deadly 
 And I'm shootin them gangsta melodies to your heart and soul 
 Know too put a mini-mac in a nap-sacc and get off the yak and kill a C.E.O. 
 Then you could see me smoke circles out your neighborhood 
 Wit a tall cann in my lap 20 pacc and 50 sacc 
 Metal to meatl the heat wont settle till you in that wood (in that wood) 
 I can't help it that's how it is 
 I mean run up in your crib and get your kids you know I could 
 You couldn't touch me witta silencer of a long-range 
 I tried to do all that I could but you think this all game 
 Sit at home drunk and judge niggaz you remind me of my uncle always havin' a grudge nigga 
 Ain't nothin' goin' to happen that ain't suppose to happen a poet of rappin' 
 Close the gap hit that ass witta mini-mac 
 Close caption 'cause I'm a M.V.P. Maxuim Violet Perfected 
 And if you fucc wit me fucc you in the ass wit the weapon 
 Grew up in the G.B.C a hood wit niggaz really don't give a fucc 
 Smashed passed'em one time hitta blunts smoke out the whole parkin lot up 
 And you already you know that about me what's your problem 
 Bumpin your gume like the Green Goblin we goin' be squabbin 
 There it is 
 Another nigga went ballstic on me 
 Xoulksnt get his way so I guess he turned his bacc on me 
 And if he didn't I'm just tired of shit 
 I rather do it on my own do it all alone he was dipped 
 There it is 
 Another nigga went ballstic on me 
 Couldn't hit the weed so I guess he turned his bacc on me 
 And if he didn't I'm just tired of shit 
 I rather do it on my own do it all alone he was dipped X2
