(Intro: Clip from a Movie) 
 Your gonna have a bank roll so big 
 When you walk down the streets 
 Its look like yo' pockets got the mumps 
 I ain't never had those kinda mumps 
 Now remember a pimp is only as good as his product 
 See and his product is women 
 Now you got to go out there 
 And get the best ones you can find 
 And you got to work them broads 
 Like they ain't never been worked before 
 And never forget 
 Any body can control a womans body 
 See but the key is to control her mind 
 (Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung) 
 Fuck these hoes 
 It's the re-do 
 You know how we do 
 Every single bitch y'all 
 From the psycho active album 
 From my nigga X (nerferious) 
 Bear nigga the flex 
 Can't come nearious (biatch) 
 (Who is this) 
 It's the muthafucc'n Lynch and I'm back on a X track 
 'Bout to tell you niggas how to keep a hoe stack'n (what you do?) 
 What you got to do 
 To have your bitch clockin' 
 Just put her on skirt, (then what?) 
 Sit her on "Stockton" fish-net stockins 
 Tight around thick dock, make it look good, to the normal nigga eye 
 That bitch'll make a killin' even if she ain't fine (why?!) 
 'Cause a big ass and some titties is a gold mine, deuce-nine dollars 
 A nut, two nuts is 58, an extra 4 if want the hoe to masturbate 
 A blow job is 24 bocks a hit 
 But it's worth she see the hoe swallow the gooey shit 
 And when I come through she be comin' to see daddy 
 Like a O.G., you know me, I'm sittin' in the Caddy, kick back 
 Look at the hoe like "Wow!" 
 Bitch you're my slave, what should I make her do know? 
 You can't treat a bitch good, you know (no) 
 What good is a nigga who ain't slappin his hoe 
 So peep, let 'em all know that you don't play 
 And every bitch gotta price to pay 
 That's real, you bitches, fuck hoes mayn 
 They got all off crack, tryin' to make you scratch 
 That's realer than real, shots to that nigga Nerferious 
 He put down the original game, nigga just need to bring back some doe 
 Slow me, uh, productions 
 (Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung) 
 Who's the hoe? A bitch named {silence} was the trick 
 She gave up the poo-poo for not one cent 
 She didn't pay, fuck it I kept the hoe 
 Every morning at 6 A.M. she was leavin' out my window 
 The close homie probably hit'em too 
 I thought I gave her fuck but she probably fucked the whole crew 
 I can't lie, I hella liked the bitch 
 But like X-Raided said: "Once a bitch, always a bitch" 
 So why try to change her? 
 I rather be by myself, fuck a hoe I strangle her 
 The only woman I respect 
 Is my muthafucken moma, disrespect I break yo neck 
 It's hella easy pullin hoes (hella easy pullin) 
 Half 'cause I got game and half 'cause I'm in the stores 
 Dumb bitch you, you get's no play (24 street) 
 You got a price to pay, fa sho 
 Fuck these all muthafucken 
 Disease carrien 
 Muthafucken red pussy havin' 
 'Cause it's been dug up, stretch up, phunky stupid ass, biatches 
 Set up bicthes, yaknowwhuti'msayin 
 Fuck 'em and leave 'em 
 (Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung) 
 That's that bitch givin' up the cash 
 I know a hoe, who would straight up jack yo ass 
 You might go to the mo-mo and get you some 
 Then you wakin' in hella broke and feelin' dumb 
 She made you cum then your ass went to sleep (then what hapend?) 
 Took your ki and out the doo' the hoe creep 
 You got got by a sneeky ass bitch 
 Now she's kickin with a notha nigga, front you shit 
 You said the baby had you caught, that's what you said 
 But you thought she was sprung so you gave her the bread 
 It was all of the bitches plot 
 Big spider web, yo ass got caught 
 You went in her that night loc 
 Yeah, she said use the rubber, a big fucken 
 She got head, ate and paid quick 
 And all you got was a fat ass check to spend 
 See, niggaz just love the bomb shit 
 Them bitches cry to make a nigga go for it 
 But not me, nigga I do it my way 
 'Cause every bitch got a price to pay, fa sho 
 You know, what I say, haha, them bitches got you stretched out...
