I woke up early in the mornin 
 Still yawnin 
 Hit the skiit and its on then 
 I walk my ass out to my car 
 Bout to hit the bar 
 But I didn't get far 
 (Why not) 
 I seen a nigga that I don't like 
 (Why) 
 'Cause he was fucking with me last night 
 What I'm bout to do is bust a u-ie 'cause I'm wet 
 Roll up on his bitch ass and blast him with my tech 
 And keep rollin' 
 Take ecstasy I'm still rollin' 
 I got to the bar and I go in 
 Give me a double shot of hennessy 
 The nigga at the end of the bar mean muggin me 
 Seems I was sittin' next to his biatch 
 Now he gonna try and start some sheit. wrong nigga 
 Wrong time 
 Wrong state of mind 
 Now you gonna seem some slugs flyin mommas cryin 
 Niggas dien 
 Babies whining 
 Eclipse empty out 3 clips of funk up in the bar 
 Might as well take the money go to my car 
 And keep rollin' 
 Rollin' 
 Rollin' 
 I'm still rollin' 
 Mac ten tech nine mac 11 I don't know what one to choose 
 Ill spray you away 
 Bout to have a bad day 
 A nigga can't loose 
 Toke out 
 Smoked out 
 Hella wet think a nigga smoke some crack 
 Somebody please tell me when they started putting steering wheels in the back of Cadillacs 
 Substance got some niggas mothas seein how past lost 
 Do I wanna go kill these niggas 
 Or should I just kill and jack off 
 Decisions got me confused and now my minds torn 
 Either way I better make a move 'cause a nigga wanna be home for the Osborn's on my cellular bout to call a bitch but I'm hella geeked 
 Come to think about it my cell phones been disconnected since last week. 
 I done did it this time 
 I fucked around and went to far 
 I coulda swore I seen a motha fuckin' teletubby drivin' a cop car 
 Way past my limit 
 Ain't been fucked up like this in a minute 
 Went to the pack popped trunk there's a car seat with my baby still in it 
 Some days fucked 
 Out my way 'cause I'm havin' a bad year 
 Matter fact fuck this rap crew 
 Pass me a warm beer. 
 I drink liquor like a wino 
 Always smokin' dope 
 I pray I don't od og super loc 
 My pistol smoke like a Newport 
 I mean more to life than crow 
 Catch you in my ripped up trench coat man its cold and rainy 
 But I ain't even complain 
 Wanna see me release some anger 
 Ill bust a cap in your Ania' 
 Give yo momma some fat meat greezy 
 It's the strangest 
 I am dangerous i 
 M the big bad wolf l 
 Little red riding hood 
 I'm always up to no good 
 Nigga I kicks it my hood 
 Nigga where you at 
 Nigga where you at 
 I rolls with a chain gain 
 Bitch on the back of my Harley 
 While I change lanes 
 Sippin on a fifth of vodka mixed with antifreeze
