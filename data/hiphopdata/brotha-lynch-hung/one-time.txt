Man these wicked streets will drive a nigga insane 
 The week a cock back and put a pistol to da brain 
 Weed alcohol nicotine and cocaine 
 The plot to break us all down to eat 
 You gotta cheat to break the law down 
 Fuck 'em buck 'em all down 
 Y'all down we can tear this motha fucka up again 
 Shootin nootin snatchin people out they trucks again 
 Fuck 'em den them motha fuckas wanna lock me up again 
 Have me duck stretched right writin letters home from the pin 
 Man fuck that id rather be stuck back on my block ssellin rocks wit a glock 
 Runnin' from da cops fuck one time 
 Grindin in da California sunshine 
 WHAT am I do get rich bitch fuck money sometimes 
 Runnin' numbas ride the runnas get yo bundles keep it commin when you get IT GET IT GET IT holla 
 Money money money 
 Like its one time 
 Grindin in this California sunshine 
 From la to da bay to sac town and back downthey can take a bird outa town on a greyhound 
 Or serve on curb in yah hood nigga stay down 
 Block shit we rock shit like cocaine 
 Hit the mean street trippin' and dippin servin' up whole thangs 
 Hotta then a ma fucka 
 Ther goes the rival you know the cities too small 
 Better no I'm liable ill take a strap up in da mall 
 No bull shit illeagle fo clips 
 Got that dual shit we be smokin' 'em up you don't know enough its rough 
 If life was free I would say fuck pussy nigga don't push me 
 I'm an o face killajay for hes even if its bloody I get more cheese 
 Smokin' hella pounds of weed oe fukin up my gut 
 But I'm as drunk as can be 
 And eatin raw meat 
 Reak what you sow

 Die at 21 nigga 
 Fuck gettin' old 
 Money tah fold killa 
 Show shootin ledge hoes 
 Lick then split don't trust no setup hoes 
 Where dem clothes 
 Grindin in this California sunshine 
 One nine killa for higher fuck money sometimes 
 I live a life of a mobsta 
 Just talkin' money eatin lobsta 
 And life swallows nigga just like a monsta 
 Ya bones is the proof of death 
 Investigators later said he dies a spooky death 
 You don't even wanna hear how they said he died 
 Just as well as californias home for homicide 
 We dodge death all dya tryin' ta stay paid 
 And if our rivals don't come then the cops don't raid 
 So if a nigga ain't high you no we drunk as fuck 
 And if a nigga ain't rich hes tryin' ta touch a buck
