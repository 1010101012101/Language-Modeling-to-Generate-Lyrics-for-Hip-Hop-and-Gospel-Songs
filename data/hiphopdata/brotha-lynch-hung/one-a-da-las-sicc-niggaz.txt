(1st verse) 
 (Brotha Lynch Hung) 
 I'm one of the last sicc niggas that you herd thus far 
 You can bump me at your crib but while you off that nitro in your car 
 So I don't have to say that I'ma super star 
 But if you get high than you can feel me no matter who you are 
 Well I got medevil but I had to leave'em weak niggas alone 
 Situation dirty skweaky clean brotha lynch hung 
 That's right I gots to have my weed lord knows I'ma feind 
 Bitch nigga don't respect me 45 for the peicsh nigga please 
 I been spendin "G's" hold up nigga freeze 
 Come up off that weed cause you den fucked around and went up on me 
 I want the whole zip lock full of shamrock 
 And if you ditch it in yo pocket I'ma heat the heat and leave you in a 
 Meat lock 
 Now that's my knock heats to the side wit the mask on 
 I'ma give you 15 percent so if you need to get yo blast on 
 And that's a fat zone that's a good start 
 You can sac off in the service take it to the heart 
 I'ma lil nigga thinkin' big 
 Cut off yo nuts and leave you screamin like a starved pig 
 Hold you hostage in yo crib 
 Plan the whole stuation out so I got first dibs 
 Now bigga than life is how I comin' out 
 Rigorous and vigorous you niggas know what I'm talkin' bout 
 I want cheese and lettuce in my wallet so fetish 
 And I'ma gonna break through like Jerome Bettis pro status 
 All this time I got ryhme on my mind every dime 
 I spend it on some weed and some studio time 
 Drink O-E out the mickeys big mouth 
 My point is I be in the cut trying to keep these snakes out my house 
 (Brotha Lynch Hung talking) 
 You know I push I push play on brain one day 
 And it played back some shit some shit containing (some shit 
 Containing) 
 Snakes (snakes) 
 I mean talk to me (serpants) 
 (2nd verse) 
 (Brotha Lynch Hung) 
 I'm one of the last sicc niggas that you herd thus far 
 You can bump me at your crib but while you off that nitro in your car 
 So I don't have to say that I'ma super star 
 But if you get high than you can feel me no matter who you are 
 Nigga now I shit lyrics but I can't use'em 
 Have yo son trippin' Brotha Lynch Hungs loopin (loopin) 
 They be off that bottle talkin' bout Brotha Lynch be talkin' bout 
 Sicc shit I herd he ate his mama out 
 Now how this motherfucker gone write some shit 'bout the Brotha Lynch 
 Hung 
 'Cause he killin' in his song 
 He say that nigga shit tight but he ain't shit 
 He say god is my witness I herd he fuck them bitches 
 Which is suppose to be wrong criticizin my love song 
 You get the rope fuckin' wit the Brotha Lynch Hung 
 Wrong information make atemadation 
 Catch you on yo weed high (catch you on yo weed high) 
 Tow you up like a pitch been 
 Feelin' dick hard when you betta get yo bitched in it gets thin 
 And I'm off this Black &Mild shit 
 Tall Cannon told me its smooth and now I'm buyin boxes of it 
 Tryin' to relax and deal wit these taxes 
 'Cause they be at my checks wit them axes twenty sac's 
 In the back seat I'm licenseless 
 Hope motherfuckin baby mama ain't no shisty bitch 
 She wanna publish ah-ight that's cool 
 She want some other shit get that hydro tube 
 Niggas always think I talk about'em because I talk shit 
 My worst nightmare was killin' my bitch for tryin' to get my grits 
 I'm like Marc Spits I swim a channel for my shit 
 And watch your heart split I'm doing damage to yo bitch (doing damage 
 To yo Bee-yotch) 
 And whlie your heart switch 
 You betta remember where you came from bitch 
 (Another voice) 
 Know what I'm saying can't even get caught up-nitro hit 
 Staring at the holic till they got'em on sicc 
 Is y'all niggas really even listening 
 For real doe is y'all niggas even really listening 
 Whatever the fuck whatever the fuck
