I might just eat your brains to see what's in your soul 
 I'm high drunk wet angry 
 They gone have to capture me I'm cookin' 'em up in a factory 
 Nigga ya dead now 
 Nigga ya dead now 
 Can I have a napkin? 
 I eat his insides out nobody knew what happened 
 I ran down the avenue, all red like mac10 
 Jailhouse shank tako nigga he died laughin' 
 Blue dickies bloodied up always keep 'em saggin' 
 Head trauma, you couldn't even fix it up wit aspirin 
 As if 
 Niggas wanna eat but I eat ask em 
 Nigga you wanna certified dope record cash em 
 That's why I'm STRANGE on that ass I gotta passion 
 Only reason I spit like this nigga I drink acid 
 Modern day Ca$his Roy Jones Mayweather 
 You couldn't tell me nothin' bout sicc nigga we stay together 
 Sleep in the same bed runnin' through the same bread 
 Still spittin' fire if you know the rap games dead GRRR 
 I eat spaghetti intestines so I don't give a fuck about your funny ass tactics 
 And I don't wanna run up in your stomach 
 Pepto 
 All you other horrorcore rappers 
 DREP though 
 Run up in em 
 Cut 'em in the mother fuckin' neck though 
 No more rappin' no need to use the Techno 
 My rhymes like lead bullets leavin' your set wet though 
 I challenge you motherfuckers I'ma broke nigga so lets go 
 Tech N9ne Sacramento cannibal I eat 
 Breath stink like human meat got pieces in my teeth 
 Can I Get A Toothpick? 
 Overdose on 24 pills that way you guilty motherfuckers know what the truth is 
 Niggas think they know me they callin' me a OG 
 Fuck all your sympathy nigga you can die slowly 
 Poisonous get your boys in this I take 'em by the dozen 
 Nigga I get devious that was my little cousin 
 Nigga I'm just sick in the head you thought I wasn't? 
 I'll make a nigga drink my piss guzzle 'n' love it! 
 I might just eat your brains to see what's in your soul 
 I'm high drunk wet angry 
 They gone have to capture me I'm cookin' 'em up in a factory 
 Nigga ya dead now 
 Nigga ya dead now 
 Excuse me, can I have a napkin? 
 I'm drippin' like a vampire when he ain't rappin' 
 I eat rappers up, I admit, I eat swine 
 With a little squeeze from the lemon and lime 
 Me I hate women all the time (I really mean) exes 
 Dream about 
 Leavin' 'em in the back of the Lexus 
 Cut throat legs spread open like Texas 
 Razor blade pussy lips nigga she died gaspin' 
 Murder without a motive its ya boy I gotta passion 
 N I be puffin on that kush like Ashton, Sebastian 
 You don't wanna fuck around gattin' 
 Music either I gotta couple of them fat ones
