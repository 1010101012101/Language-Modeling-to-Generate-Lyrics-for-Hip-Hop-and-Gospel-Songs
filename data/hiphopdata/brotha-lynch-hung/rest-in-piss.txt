(Brotha Lynch) 
 Yeah I'm back up in this motherfucker 
 For the 9 whatever the fuck 
 You know I ain't dead yet 
 I'm with my real loc niggas 
 I was a dead man, walking they say, so every night I hit the gates 
 Load the AK and post up, in the window till come day, anyway hey 
 I feel the payback simmering in my brain 
 But thoughts of death cloud my mind 
 As my niggas is gone away many clips and 24 riches, packed 
 But who really got my back 
 Now that them niggas done hit the grave 
 I'm killing them off for the olds days 
 24 ways and a 24 sack of that purple cush and make me sicker 
 Than sick and even get Ripgut Cannibal if you wish 
 Cause nigga it's EBK everyday all day to the day I die 
 I'm creepin' through yo set with a mini mac 10 
 AR15 rugga with a 12 gauge pump in the trunk 
 And a black beany disguise 
 That nigga that you can't see jus kuz of dem glocks and locs 
 Over my eyes crept like a black cat with a mac 
 With a mac 10 in my lap and a fat sack of that crack 
 Took a hit of that shit and seen some niggas with a 4-5 
 So I let 'em have it bounce to the O you know trippin' 
 On that Indonesian shit and a 9 millimeter for you to dump 
 And put one in your bitch and put her in her grave 
 With that empty 40 ounce bottle and don't leave a drip 
 Then bounce to that ounce 
 With a lack and a mac and a fat pack sack of dat indo shit 
 I'm sicker than sick them niggas gotta admit when I 
 Grab my shit you either gone or get caught with a hot one 
 Nigga so rest in piss 
 Just call me Agent Double O Deuce 4 Blocc 
 I got that 9 milli glock and ready to put one in your knot 
 "Rest in Piss" (Shit) (repeat 4x) 
 (Brotha Lynch) 
 From the rep of the depth of the double O 
 Duece foe block with a glock in my pocket 
 Full of that sess you betta wear a bullet proof vest 
 When I'm match your set betta pack you a tech 
 'Cause I'm at your neck with a clip full of that shit 
 Nigga don't trip when I put one in your dick that Ripgut Cannibal 
 Hannibal shit nigga nuts and guts all over my chest 
 And stomach running with no slack threw my strap in the back 
 Twist me up a sack and I'm back at the Garden Block 
 Kicking it with maniac the nigga that a maniac sicker than sick 
 When a clips in progress put on the ground 
 With a brain full of them nine slugs read him in Reader's Digest 
 Uh I found a new love trickeling in my brain half of the doja 
 Half of the OE half of the fact that I am insane nigga 
 It's that duece foe blockster 
 Where niggas never put their glocks up 
 And get their cocks sucked nigga you just can't stop us 
 Loc to the brain insane with a main game that will maintain 
 Untouchable cut your throat and leave you in the street 
 With a lynch around your throat motherfucker 
 Cause you ain't got no love foe the block 
 Pop gotta hot foe that 24 street block 
 Nigga that took a shot rest in piss
