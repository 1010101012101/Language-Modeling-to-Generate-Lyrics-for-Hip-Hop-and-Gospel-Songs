You ain't wifey material 
 I just want your body I ain't even in love, girl you're just a hottie 
 (Verse 1 rap) 
 Think back bout 120 days ago we first met in the walmart superstore exchanged phone numbers and we took it from there you informed off da back that you'z a big old player so you got a sorry brotha dat don't know how to act and had the nerve to warn me not to get attatched you do your thing I do my thing and we keepz it real is the agreement dat we had (dats the deal!) 
 Was it the wee wee? was it the French kiss? was it the back rubs that made you act like this? was it the long conversations on the phone at night dat got you thinking you could ever be a playboys wife but you can cancel that I gotta blast your plan you gotta better chance at getting cash from Ed McMan I hate to have to tell you you ain't wifey material you ain't domesticated you could barely cook cereal!
