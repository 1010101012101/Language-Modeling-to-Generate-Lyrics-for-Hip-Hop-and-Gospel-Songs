 On fire like a human torch

 Ain't nobody can fucc wit me even luccily 
 Get cut in three I'm a fuccin beast I tucc the three 
 Fifty-seven and keep me revin' 
 Mr. Tech Ryhme, pure white cocaine spit not even stepped on 
 Sort of like blue magic 
 The pussy I stab at it 
 And stab at it, I'm an addict it bleeds when I tap it 
 Manic Depressive 
 And if you test'em 
 Mann is the lesson 
 Plan it get your chest split 
 Dance smith and weston and it will test'em 
 Hand it to Kevin 
 Cannibal session 
 Man full of intestine

 Coathanger 
 Throatsta Strangler 
 Your folks get mangled up 
 Cut'em up from the navel (uh) 
 (C-Lim) 
 Put you in the hospital fast 
 Have you wearin' a oxygen mask 
 Wit the doctors in the surgey 
 Gettin' in a Colostomy Bag X2 
 My whole cigarette is wet 
 I'm about to smoke it 
 Get hard like 
 East Oakland 
 Rappers I super soak'em 
 After the kruger get over'em 
 I be standin over'em wit nine milimeter 
 Hit'em like a wide reciver 
 Like 
 Jerry Rice 
 Them niggaz think I'm weak 'cause I'm very nice 
 All I do is think about eatin them every night 
 So I got to carry every knife, every machete 
 I'm steadily deadily it's heavily bevely gettin' cut up 
 I'll be a the motel fucced up 
 Blood in my cup witta fine bitch hugged up 
 Till my heart get plugged up 
 I'm still going to be in my Dickies shit thugged up 
 Nigga throwin' up blood throwin' up guts nigga what's what 
 We kind of strange nigga we eat nigga nuts and guts 
 You already know what I eat your insides 
 And break down your enzymes 
 And take out your insides
