 There was a 187 on 24th Street (Did You Know?) 
 There was a 187 on 24th Street 
 See you can get your mind tore up fuckin' wit us 
 We let straps bust X2 
 21st, 24th, and 29th Florin Road to Meadowview just to say a few 
 Everynight I use to walk down the street drunk with a bottle in my strap 
 'Cause Blocc niggaz don't sock niggaz they shoot niggaz in the bacc 
 Why you ain't lookin' you livin' get tooken 
 Run up in your living room wit choppas tryin' to take out your parntas 
 It's a fuck up interlude (Interlude) 
 I was only 17 with a dream in this scene 
 Appaenetly the gangstas took me under 
 No wonder it must've been a gangbang-thang-and-a-slang-cane-gang 
 Got to mantain brain on you roaches like dirty poaches 
 I mean leave you in the gang even if you broke shit 
 I don't give a fuck 
 Put the quarter in the slot and play the game until I see what I got 
 I let straps pop if I got too 'cause the streets is hot too 
 So I bop fools ever understood 'em even understand 'em and no not too 
 Down for half 'em bandits so I ran it the away I had too 
 Met him in the park after dark and it took less then a second for the nine to spark

 We drag shit to the river and deliver your ass quick 
 We all was bad kids didn't even like each other that much 
 All we did was mean mug and put that nine on the clutch niggaz can get touch 
 We touchin' 'em up like jeri curls every girl was trippin' 
 We rip'em to the levy wit'em ???? 
 Like Earl the Pearl don't miss to often in a coffin 
 Yeah that's your new world we keep'em popin automatics be knoccin' 
 Garden Blocc 'cause we the hardest on the streets 
 Jocc CD's like rocc on the street 
 We ridin' your shit 'cause and lovin' you for it 
 And you can't ingore it that rip shit 
 That put you in the trunk hald-dead wit your wig split shit 
 We live that shit every day all day every chance we get 
 And in the backyard we got pit that eat raw meat ant tib bits we just as sicc 
 I don't give a fuck 
 Put the quarter in the slot and play the game until I see what I got 
 I let gat's pop

 I look in your face and see nothing but hate 
 And even though you love me I'm still clinchin' away 
 That how it goes in the state where blue rags murder blue rags 
 And hoot lags get body bags to Mazda rotary backseat toe tags 
 It's so bad see I don't know who to trust 
 Last time a trusted a nigga he came out wit sum stuff 
 He was talkin' shit about me nigga and I didn't know what to do 
 So I keep that heat that eat like cujo 
 That will fold up your whole crew 
 Like new clothes I choose those 
 Niggaz that 'ol carry for'-for' and do those 
 Things that put some cold on your toes your whole body froze 
 No matter who you think I should kicc it wit 
 I do it solo end that's it (You Trip)
