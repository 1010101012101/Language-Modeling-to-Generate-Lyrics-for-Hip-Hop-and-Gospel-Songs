(Hung) 
 Look up in the sky it's a motherfuckin slug 
 Some nigga done let one off and only my cousins sheddin' blood 
 That loccest muthafucka from 29 st. throwin' up his flag 
 So nigga got madd and went to the crib with a .45 mag 
 Returned to the set-up and let my cousin have it 
 That nigga that died for the garden blocc 
 Gang did time for the garden blocc 
 And ended up stuck in a muthafuckin casket but I don't be givin' a fuck 
 I'm tappin up in your program before you know it 
 I'm creepin' up on ya in a licorice dark black drop-top broham 
 With a 12 gauge pump in da trunk and a clip full of funk 
 And a fat purple cush blunt so call it what you want 
 I call it the fever of da funkhouse 
 Dumpin gauge shells in that ass leavin' you face down 
 Chest down with a gang of guts hangin' out yo ass nigga 
 You know tha process they wanna kill me 
 Now I'm a dead man walkin' to my funeral can you feel me 
 Now and if die before your set gets blasted 
 That's on the garden 'cause I'm gonna rise up out my casket 
 Chorus: repeat 2X 
 I'm liquor sicc and I just might lose control 
 So load your clips loccs 'cause we ridin' for our foes 
 (Hung) 
 And I'm out in 6 5' hardtop impala lookin' for that 187 
 There we go and right behind 'em bustin' wit my mack 11 
 Straight bumpa to bumpa 12 gage pump was that little X loccsta 
 Givin' up his set dumpin on niggas just like hes supposed ta 
 Nigga this is real deal shit it's not about crip or blood 
 It's about pay back that family loves 
 So nigga now fuck yo whole click 
 Like 24 deep they tryin' ta kill me fo my fuckin' tapes 
 Them baby rapes so nigga get out my fuckin' face 
 If I was really bangin' niggaz would know 
 'Cause I'd have they whole set lookin' like L.A. when da earthquake hit 
 Nigga fuckin' wit my tek I'm from da garden blocc 
 No matter what nobody say I'm makin' my money 
 And not lettin that bangin' shit get in my way 
 Niggaz get mad they wanna see the lynch rippin 
 I'm wearing blue yeah but motherfucker I ain't even trippin' 
 But for cousin Q-Ball, Mr.Doc, and Sicx my cousin eclipse 
 And 2 of my kidz nigga catch these clips 
 (Hung) 
 There ain't no fuckin' way my cousin's 
 Gonna lay up in a casket wit no retaliation 
 There ain't no fuckin' way that motherfucker died for that blocc 
 So lets heat them motherfuckin glocks (2x)
