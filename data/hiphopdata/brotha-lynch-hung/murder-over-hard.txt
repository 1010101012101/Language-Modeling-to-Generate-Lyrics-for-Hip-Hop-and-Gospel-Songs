I just got off the phone with DJ Cat, Grr! 
 It was murder over hard like I like my eggs! 
 Eat em' up, she don't need no muh' fuckin' grave 
 We in love, me and murder we tight like vice grips! 
 She don't know the raw like my murder over hard. 
 It was murder over hard like I like my eggs! 
 Eat em' up, she don't need no muh' fuckin' grave 
 We in love, me and murder we tight like vice grips! 
 She don't know the raw like my murder over hard. 
 I guess I'm different I'm grippin' a samurai 
 I be damned if I spit at your bitch and I am denied 
 I'm John Allen
