I tried to commit suicide 
 I had a gun in my mouth, and a tear in my eye 
 Where's my mothafuccin' daughter at 
 Thinkin' about the next place I can slaughter at 
 I know she wonder's where her father's at (X2) 
 I Tried to Commit... 
 Suicide I had alot on my mind 
 I couldn't figure nothin' out 
 And my momma just died it's just like 
 Damn everything was blowin' up in my mind 
 I couldn't determine what was wrong or right 
 I'm goin' 
 Madesicc 
 (foe life) 
 I ain't the type to bitch, whine or moan 
 But now I'm in a werid place and I'm really missin' home 
 Naw metaphorically I'm really missin' home 
 I couldn't explain how much I'm really missin' home (I ain't gone) 
 I'm on some shit that'o get you locced up 
 Put in the trunk nigga let's life shits fucced up 
 I remember when I use to sit at home all alone in my room thinkin' 
 I'm hungry for food my momma screamin' in the front room 
 Drivin' me crazy I feel like jumpin' out the window 
 I'm itchin' like scabies 'cause my minds tryin' to play me 
 And nobody cares, I might as well take this nine mili and die right here 
 I tried to commit suicide 
 I had a gun in my mouth, and a tear in my eye 
 Where's my mothafuccin' daughter at 
 Thinkin' about the next place I can slaughter at 
 I know she wonder's where her father's at (X2) 
 I tried to commit... 
 Life keep a gun 
 I'm always on the watch-out 
 Niggaz think I'm dumb 
 Till I pull that glocc out 
 Leave a nigga numb 
 Somebody bring the cops out 
 'Cause his work day is done 
 Yeah, he had to clocc out 
 Yeah, I could be the blocc out 
 Niggaz really don't want that 
 Send'em on the plane wit that thang in his dark blacc 
 Plastic and as if I asked it, it came out 
 Couldn't trust a nigga so I mantain the same route 
 Why should I trust a nigga they think wit they penis 
 Then they wonder why there's friction between us 
 I'm tryin' to get to Venus suck and duck you mothafuckas 
 I could just of leave it and treat it like another supper 
 I could just eat it take it how it comes 
 When it's all said and done we ain't got to wait for reruns 
 I can't even see 'cause in the rear view mirror 
 Hey, let me just get to this nine 
 I tried to commit suicide 
 I had a gun in my mouth, and a tear in my eye 
 Where's my mothafuccin' daughter at 
 Thinkin' about the next place I can slaughter at 
 I know she wonder's where her father's at (X2) 
 I tried to commit... 
 Hey my life been so fucc'd up 
 It's all on a bitch 
 Ever since I was 13 I wanted to be rich 
 Tried sellin' dope (Naw that didn't work out) 
 I was juccin' in the creek 
 I couldn't get my work-out 
 Too many niggaz was juccin' that brought the cops out 
 Yeah I went bacc to the 
 Gardens 
 and mom kept me locc'd out 
 Livin' in the regal think' sumthin' illegal 
 We know how it is when you workin' wit them eagles 
 Dope money pay for my EP 
 Tower Records 
 put it out on ca-sign 
 And I had a sample of 
 Knee Deep 
 Those days were good days these days are no good 
 Niggaz think I got a million probalby 'cause I probably should 
 Sittin' in this thigh-ass studio 'bout to change it 
 Reverse and rearrange it now I'm wit 
 Strange

 This better work-out I'm tired of the same shit 
 So I put it in my mouth yeah, I'm goin' out 
 I tried to commit suicide 
 I had a gun in my mouth, and a tear in my eye 
 Where's my mothafuccin' daughter at 
 Thinkin' about the next place I can slaughter at 
 I know she wonder's where her father's at (X2)
