I mix it with a bit of bakin soda 
 In this crack sack in the back pack before I make 'em older 
 I put 'em in the game, nigga imma franchise player 
 Put it in his brain, nigga, than a zen dialator 
 Roll in the quiet, I pull heavy metal when you can fry quick 
 Like sizzline, all I wanna know, is is he clean 
 If it's not, it's right off the levy, smash off in a Chevy 
 If it's hot, smoke up the whole area like Richard Petty 
 In his brains and his guts in his backseat, lookin' like spaghetti in the pot 
 Ready or not, I stay steady with the shot 
 From long distance for instance break out like Eddie Rock 
 Before I'm leavin' 'em leavin' you bleedin on yo block 
 Good night, don't even fight, just let it go 
 And too many live, when they get hit with the technical 
 I don't sweat it though, I just roll 
 I ain't gotta prove it I just know 
 It's all ready betta get used to it 
 I do hose, so if you see me on the streets and you got, beef 
 Believe me nigga I do blow hella niggas brains out 
 Fuckin' wit mine, 'cause what I do got, I got it while I was stuck on the grind 
 Carryin two glocks, gettin' off these rocks, gettin' my rocks off 
 Fuckin' slut bitches with nines until it pops off 
 Fuckin' stuck dicks in ya mind - fuckin' ya block off (nigga) 
 Fuck you faggots, you niggas talk soft 
 Good night, don't even fight, just let it go 
 And too many live, when they get hit with the technical 
 I don't sweat it though, I just roll 
 I ain't gotta prove it I just know 
 It's all ready betta get used to it 
 I'll put ya brains in a trash compactor, I'm smashin backwards 
 And blastin at ya spot with the mac n 
 I gets to crackin' like a bad hair gaskin 
 I'll take ya nuts, to ya momma in a basket 
 I don't give a fuck, touch 'em up quicker than earl shine 
 Dip on that ass in the pearl white and then good night 
 Don't even fight, just let it go, and too many live 
 When they get hit with the technical, but I don't sweat it though 
 Imma blocc nigga like C-Bo, make ya bleed slow 
 Jumpin' over you niggas like I was Eval Knievel 
 When I hit that right strapped up, you G niggas betta back up, pack up 
 'Cause bodies bout to stack up, when the moseroty wearin black stuff 
 And I'm back in the cut, fuckin' it up, you young niggas betta wait yours 
 Imma sicko psycho run in the house get so psycho blood type-O 
 Dancin with the devil with my hands on heavy metal, oh 
 On every level go, when I put the pedal to the flo 
 It's good night... 
 Some say I'm sicka than syphilis nigga get the picture? 
 I'll rip ya spleen out and cook it and go have dinner wit ya 
 I'm sicker than head like Charles Michael than it takes, to get ya 
 To paint different pictures if it's in the way hit ya with the siccness 
 Get this nigga imma keep it gangsta 
 See you in the club and run up on ya ass then bank ya 
 Ain't the, nigga to be fuckin' with when I got revenue 
 If anybody got niggas that'll roll by and pop you, nigga, Kevin do 
 I gots ta keep it that way, carry the outlaw like who is you? 
 I'm in grand blue like imma Dallas cowboy 
 24 on my jersey hit 'em up by the 03 
 In the morning catch 'em stretchin and yawnin 
 And stretch 'em out on the lawn and we're so dirty 
 I put 'em in trash bags and put 'em in the backyard 
 Like I was livin' in Baghdad, I be givin' niggas they hat back 
 And they heart in my backpack, and they guts and they nuts 
 And they intestines up in the Cadillac 
 Good night, don't even fight, I split that black flag 
 Niggas got it mixed up like baking soda in a crack sack 
 Gotta get ya back cracked open, imma southside strangler 
 Creepin' up in all black like Oakland imma be the thang in ya 
 Good night, don't even fight, just let it go 
 And too many live, when they get hit with the technical 
 I don't sweat it though, I just roll 
 I ain't gotta prove it I just know 
 It's all ready betta get used to it
