I hate when niggaz get on the phone when they around me 
 It ain't business shit 
 If it was business shit I could see what your saying 
 These niggaz get on the phone man, they make me feel alittle funny 
 Y'all know what I mean (x2) 
 You handled business when you get on the phone... 
 I hate when niggaz get on the phone when they around me 
 I really get paraniod get the 50 pound piece 
 Paper box in my soccs use it for ground beef 
 I know they plottin' so I don't go to town meetin's 
 They wanna hit me like Barry Bonds 
 They wanna get me in the baccseat and send me to my mom's 
 They wanna picc me up 
 They want the ambulance get me up 
 They think I don't know 
 I didn't sign up for this 
 Black Market got me in this twist and did a flip flop baccflip 
 But this is Crip hop that's it ('cause) 
 Just wipe your dicc off that's it 
 Yeah, just get your bitch off that's it 
 Just 'cause your shit's soft that's it 
 I like to get off gat spit 
 I like to spit raw rap shit 
 I might get shit on baccward 
 Taccin it out on the wrong niggaz yeah, and that hurts (ouch) 
 So I have to let the gat squirt then disappear and that works 
 Just before we get into the last song 
 Shouts out to Strange Music for puttin' me on 
 Y'all mean this weather out here is crazy (this crazy)
