Worms go in, worms go out 
 Bugs coming out her mouth 
 Chop 'em up, chop 'em up, chop 'em up, chop 'em up 
 Cut 'em up, cut 'em up, cut 'em up, cut 'em up 
 I don't be givin' a motherfuck, red dead bodies in this truck, time to get another truck 
 This is my last time, sicker than the ass virus 
 It's been a bad night, it's, it's finna pass by us 
 I heard he was a cannibal 
 I heard he take the skulls and eat 'em up like a cantaloupe 
 I heard he eat the human meat like humans eat the animal 
 See how they talk about me? I'm about these antidotes 
 Painkillers, Prozac, muscle relaxers, trust me, my back hurts 
 Insane in the membrane, nigga, my brain might be on backwards 
 I'mma get back to work, kill 'em and put 'em in a cardboard box 
 Brains in a basket 
 Rumor has it I lock like a mastiff and I got enough zip-lock plastic 
 Give a nigga that hip hop casket, who can put 'em in a zip-lock fastest? 
 Me! That's who, shit get thick like I'm molasses 
 I'ma get 'em and put 'em in something sinister Dennis, you motherfuckin' menace, 
 I'm 'bout to finish 'em 
 When does a cannibal, mannibal, animal finish up? I don't know 
 I just hate the way things are, I fuckin' hate the music now 
 Rappers needs to get smashed, show 'em they ain't useful now 
 They one-hitter quitters, skinny jean niggas 
 R&B singers, I'm a crocodile meat eater 
 I hate the way things are, I fuckin' hate the music now 
 Rappers needs to get smashed, show 'em they ain't useful now 
 They one-hitter quitters, skinny jean niggas 
 R&B singers, I'm a crocodile meat eater 
 Rip 'em up, rip 'em up, rip 'em up, rip 'em up 
 Cut 'em up, cut 'em up, cut 'em up, cut 'em up 
 I be givin' the liver disease, killin' 'em 
 Turning they insides to raw hide, grillin' 'em 
 This is what happened, I wrapped him up in some plastic 
 And took 'em home for the acid bath, it was so funny, I have to laugh 
 These niggas ain't eatin' meat, I beat 'em then leave 
 Taking them out for cheap, I'mma put that body up 
 Blood stains in the motel lobby, I'ma probably cut 
 Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, I'm an all-day nut, Friday, Saturday and Fools' Day 
 I'ma put the 9 milli to your toupee 
 Clock 'em out, Friday is a new day 
 Cut 'em out, spread the body? 
 Two labels, nigga, two chains 
 Butcher knife in a black backpack, in a black Cadillac, make 'em take a catnap 
 I get raw like Eddie Murph, nigga, have your family hurt, nigga 
 I put family first, nigga, fuck around and make it worse, nigga 
 (Push him out the door) Put him in a hearse, nigga 
 I'mma get 'em and put 'em in something sinister 
 Dennis, you motherfuckin' menace, I'm 'bout to finish 'em 
 When does a cannibal, mannibal, animal finish up? I don't know 
 I just hate the way things are, I fuckin' hate the music now 
 Rappers needs to get smashed, show 'em they ain't useful now 
 They one-hitter quitters, skinny jean niggas 
 R&B singers, I'm a crocodile meat eater 
 I hate the way things are, I fuckin' hate the music now 
 Rappers needs to get smashed, show 'em they ain't useful now 
 They one-hitter quitters, skinny jean niggas 
 R&B singers, I'm a crocodile meat eater 
 Now I'm eating 
 Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up 
 Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up 
 Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up 
 Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up 
 Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up 
 Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up 
 Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up 
 Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up 
 Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up 
 Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up 
 Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up 
 Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat the guts up 
 Eat 'em 
 Eat 'em 
 Eat 'em 
 Eat 'em 
 Eat 'em 
 Eat 'em 
 Eat 'em 
 Eat 'em 
 Eat 'em

 Eat 'em, eat the guts up! 
 I just hate the way things are, I fuckin' hate the music now 
 Rappers needs to get smacked, show 'em they ain't useful now 
 They one-hitter quitters, skinny jean niggas 
 R&B singers, I'm a crocodile meat eater 
 I hate the way things are, I fuckin' hate the music now 
 Rappers needs to get smacked, show 'em they ain't useful now 
 They one-hitter quitters, skinny jean niggas 
 R&B singers, I'm a crocodile meat eater 
 I need the car Chris, right now! 
 Eater!
