I used to push 
 24 Deep 
 in '92 like cocaine 
 Had them gangsta niggaz railed up doin' it wit no name 
 Stayin' at the roach motel 2 for 2 chesse hamburger deals 
 Doin' shows in broke down clubs just to get a meal 
 Imma keep it real it was all skillz that paid your bills 
 And the fact that you don't pay niggaz that shit going to get you killed 
 But don't worry about me partna 
 Like I said I'm already dead I hold this infared point blank range steadily at your head 
 'Cause I'm a blocc nigga you know what happens when you fucc wit us 
 We cut your tongues off switch niggaz and stuff bloody'em up (bloody'em up) 
 Run up in the cut and fucc it rough you up and put you up 
 These broke niggaz don't give a mothafucc 
 I want that meal ticket and we'll never kicc it 'cause you funny styles 
 Still won't fucc wit you even if you gave me my money now 
 Funny how ridaz get bought up you about to get caught up like Bo King 
 You be gettin' niggaz that's why you got no team 
 Damn, niggaz tryin' to sticc me for my papers 
 Bam, hit'em witta enough lead got away wit the caper 
 Ran too the 1964 and smashed off 
 So fucc your record company Imma 'bout to blast off (1) 
 Fucc your record company I'm about to blast off (2) (X2) 
 I was young dumb full of cum full of O.E. and Rum 
 Spittin' chunccs of meat all heat 
 Always givin' where I from in every verse 
 24 Blocc 
 like I don't give a fucc 
 Suppose to be in the studio but I'm somewhere drunk fuccin' up 
 Blacc Too Short I ain't trippin' 
 Used to be a record thing now it's a new sport put your clip in 
 I heard you be dreamin' about niggaz in ski masks with bottles of blacc molasses 
 Ran up your pad quicc woke your ass up wit the magnum 
 I could have been platnium a loc went bad when you jacc'd him 
 You get'em old like 
 Carl Weathers

 I'm mirror watchin' when I'm paccin' nigga give me my shit 
 You the type of nigga that pay for hits I don't pay for shit 
 'Cause I'm broke you wanted it that why for some reason 
 Couldn't find you for nuttin' ever since I did 
 Season Of Da Sicc 
 Picc'em off like Deion everything you see me on 
 Is stolin' in your life pure witta colon serious until it's over 
 Imma always be at that ass witta butcher knife 
 Askin' where you put your wife and why did I took your life 
 Houses got bought up you about to get caught like Bo King 
 You begettin' niggaz that's why you got no team 
 Damn, niggaz tryin' to sticc me for my papers

 Fucc your record company I'm about to blast of (1) (X2) 
 So fucc your record company Imma 'bout to blast off (2) 
 Shit is gettin' to the point where imma smash on everbody 
 And it's gettin' to the point where I don't fucc wit nobody 
 Believe it I tucc the ol' shotty in the glove compartment 
 Hit the town in ????????????? if he start shit

 Those old joints you remakin' homes imma get my profit 
 We struggle for years on the ???? we can rap it out 
 If you ????? shows I pull the tec and take you out 
 It the cut and lay low until I get my shit 
 Interrupt your day with fadeo'z put 44 holes in your windpipe 
 They know I'm sicca than sicc when I split your shit leave you coughin' up liver bits 
 Fuccin' niggaz to get your grip it ain't safe 
 Nigga where was you faith we could of blow up
