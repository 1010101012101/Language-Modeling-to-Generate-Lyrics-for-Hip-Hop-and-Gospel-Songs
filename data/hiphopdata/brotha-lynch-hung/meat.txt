Alarm clock, I hate alarm clocks 
 Hey babe I gotta get up 
 Real shit y'all 
 (1st Verse) 
 I only got enough money for some hamburger meat 
 But I still ain't trippin' that's the shit I like to eat 
 But my son he like daddy this is all we got to eat 
 I'm like son I'm about to sing big time 
 I'm downloadin beats and I'ma start writin' to em 
 And if the fans don't buy 'em I'ma kill them in they sleep 
 Bring the extra cheese 
 We gonna eat somehow like the Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese 
 Gettin' dirty meats, make me some fuckn' stacks of G's 
 With the a-r automatic uzi machine 
 All you gota do is wash it off and then put it in the freeze 
 And then we good for another couple of weeks 
 When you get older like me you'll be tuckin the heat 
 And if not you, you'll be stuck in the street 
 I wanna say ya mom love you, but that's up to she 
 But we gonna do what we gotta do 'n' that's get the meat 
 Strange music got my back they hopefully 
 But if not they really ain't no hope for me 
 That means you goin' through the same situation 
 That means we gone keep goin' through the same shit you hatin' 
 Meat, we gotta find something to eat 
 Even if we gotta go do it on the street 
 Even if we gotta go shootin' with the heat 
 Even if we lie to dude we gone get the meat, (meat, meat) 
 (2nd Verse) 
 I only got enough money for top ramen noodles 
 My son lookin' at me like he don't wanna come to close 
 He saw me in the bathroom cryin' it was to late 
 I couldn't even keep a straight face, like 2 face 
 All the mother fucka's around me they was to fake 
 I ain't got an album out now they call me to late 
 Bar b q yesterday, where the fuck was I at? 
 A football game where's my mother fuckin' hi at? 
 I remember lizz moore drive even after that 
 Starin' at my strange chain, thinkin' ain't goin' back 
 I got a new life, I'ma get a new wife, 
 I'ma get a new 9, I think it was do time 
 No matter who's wrong or who right 
 Life's like shakin' 'em up 'n' rollin' 2 dice 
 Thin slice, and my ol school homey like where you been ice 
 Just marinatin, stomach achein shit ain't been right 
 (Background vocals) 
 Real shit y'all... real shit y'all... meat 
 Hey kev wake up, fadin off, meat [Fades Out:] 
 Yo kev wake up 
 (3rd Verse) 
 Lil Kevin wake up its school time, get ya clothes on 
 Don't no body love you like me 
 We in the O zone, twilight zone 
 All we got to eat today is bullshit 
 Time for you to pray, but I don't pray I carry full clips 
 You can't be like me 'cause I'ma fuck up, 
 And if we both fuckn' up you gone be just like me 
 It's gone be a tight squeeze, we can get through this 
 You my 'lil nigga so nigga we gone do this 
 Shit, I can count it on one hand 
 Old as I am I can still cound it on one hand 
 We both Kevin mann 
 We both gotta stretch it out like a rubber band 
 I got another plan, I got a million of em 
 I'ma still come wit em, I'm still run wit em 
 We gotta keep it goin', then I'm done wit it 
 That's it, I'ma whipe my hands 
 I'm hella broke but I don't dance
