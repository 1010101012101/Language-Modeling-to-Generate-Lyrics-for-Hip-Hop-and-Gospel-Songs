And I got bodies in Explainthe trunk, some of that * pepper 
 Spaghetti your insides 
 Dead like a zombie 
 Make you go hug mommy 
 Mo' drugs on me 
 They look at me like I'm 
 Givin' bitches head * 
 Cuttin' this meat, strangers invited to eat 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Ey, Lynch, is that a blunt? 
 Shakin' and twitchin', ready to kill a nigga, oh snap! 
 Come close and get your neck slit 
 Reckless, rippin' shit out and give it as the message 
 Dinner and a movie 
 Had the cops confused when they investigate, who, me? 
 If they sue me 
 Fire up this doobie 
 Look what drugs do to me 
 Somebody better save ya, sodomize and rape ya 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Watchin' a bitch scream, yeah, buddy, it wasn't as bloody as it seems 
 Wrap you up in duck tape 
 This time I was sniffin' cocaine 
 I be havin' bad dreams and I want brains 
 A midnight killer, like it's a fucking video game 
 I'm rippin' and fuckin' the beat, nigga, game fuck 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 I hope you got my plate ready 'cause it's time to eat 
 Move quick 
 Get choked in smoke 
 Fuck my ecstasy 
 Light a match, set it off, 
 Now we all up in her 
 I kill bitches for attention 
 Fuckin' dead bodies 
 This motherfuckers' hidin' 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry 
 Murder, death, kill, we hungry
