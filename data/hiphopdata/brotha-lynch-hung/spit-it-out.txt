You're a bad man! 
 You're a very bad man! 
 If anything tastes funny spit it out 
 Don't trust it don't eat it 
 Somebody's trying to poison me 
 Somebody's trying to get in my life 
 Motherfucker make them eat it all blood all over the wall 
 Brotha Lynch Hung: 
 If anything tastes funny spit it out 
 Like this glock in the studio 
 But I'm'ma get it out 
 It was time to just do my though but won't follow directions 
 Cup of liquor at the intersection now I'm clenching on my weapon 
 Contemplating suicide thinking about little Kevin 
 Thinking about my girlfriend 
 Thinking about my situation 
 Thinking about will my world end tragically 
 So many people mad at me 
 I make them go away magically 
 But I just... 
 Put it behind me until they find me 
 This is perfect timing 
 This is hurtful rhyming 
 This is put you in the bushes if you try and try me 
 This is what you wanted so I'm going out for the fried meat 
 And when I die please burn me up and smoke me 
 Sorry I can't believe the fucking lies that you told me 
 Cause loyalty is loyalty but you don't know about that 
 Right after this COS rap I'm coming right back 
 COS: 
 If anything tastes funny spit it out 
 Can you taste it? 
 Can you smell it in the air? 
 Smells like bodies in the basement 
 Come take a walk with me down a road so sacred 
 Dead man walking scars underneath the braclet 
 No leaves on the trees dusty roads, no pavement 
 No sun 
 No shine 
 Just a lot of raining 
 One gun, one mind 
 Who am I to save it? 
 I'd rather pop the clip and blaze it 
 Bloody stage shit 
 Every room vacant in the house and I'm shaking 
 I'm colder than the glacier 
 Even where my heart breaking 
 Everything aching can't repair myself 
 Every mirror in here broken like I can't stare at myself 
 I see clear through the smoke 'cause I got air in myself 
 But every time they give me rope they think I tear at myself 
 Like I'm the plane crashing into the building 
 Like I'm the death 
 Like I'm the train coming off of the tracks 
 Guess I'm a wreck 
 Brotha Lynch Hung: 
 If anything tastes funny spit it out 
 Throw it up, sew it up, right out the 50 throw it up, right out the kidneys toe it up 
 Trying to get with me it's tough like trying to eat 
 Old meat 
 Left out 
 All night 
 Aw me 
 Oh my 
 Now I'm going through the pain and I'm the blame, they think the money and fame equals insane 
 It's a strange game 
 Looking at my strange chain 
 Thinking I'm about to change mane 
 Imma let it stay the same 
 I'm online when I play the game 
 On time nah maybe not 
 On grind nigga I'm probably the hottest 
 I'm a problem, I got problems, I can't solve all of them, hitting me at the same time 
 That's why it seems like I'm hitting you with the same rhyme game time 
 Niggas ain't in my lane I'm 
 Hard to get along with sometimes 
 That's hard life 
 Compare it to the hard right 
 I put it on the black top 
 'Cause it's going to be a hard fight 
 And it's going to be a long night 
 And it's nothing to bitch about (it's nothing to bitch about)
