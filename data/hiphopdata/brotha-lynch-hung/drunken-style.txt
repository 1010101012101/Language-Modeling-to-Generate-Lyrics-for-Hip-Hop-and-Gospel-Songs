Drunken Style Nigga (Drunken Style) 
 Give me your clothes 
 Give me your gold 
 Give me all the money you owe (right now) 
 Don't like to think so I drink heavy 
 Dam slugs out the Chevy livin' armed and deadly 
 I'm taking chunks from punks who want funk 
 Treat'em like .15's put'em in the trunk 
 I slip clean makin' sure all my shit clean 
 Then seem like a wolverine wit a gleam in sceam gangsta lean 
 Out the window hit your blocc corner everybody litted up 
 Runnin' them tires like tha 
 Daytonya 
 tuck you up it ain't nothin' 
 Pushin' buttons who wantto smoke them bustas 
 See I was a baby when I first got Sicc 
 Did the (??????????) and alcohol and 'bout fill there wall with syphills dick 
 Just my kicks tricks get chop out like a cold cut heat'em up 
 Rocked up like that cokesta I ain't no jokes or pranksta real gangsta 
 Shit from that nigga who brought you 
 Season Of Da Sicc 
 Admit that was my tightest shit besides this don't get me wrong every songs is a hit 
 Guess who made this 
 Phonk Beta 
 while you suckas ain't paying right we stayin' tight 
 Pullin' openin' Ziplocks every night my momma neva fed me right 
 We was broke some I'm off that OE you know me I'm no mothafucka joke 
 When it comes to rippin' up shit ziplock bodybag toetag 
 I leave your t-shirt sweaty anyplace anytime you ready 
 Comin' soon you want to hear more buy my shit 2002 
 Song = Drunken Style
