Hit the dank and took my glock off lock, and off 
 To the 21st blocc, I'm rollin' in a drop top 
 Three for zero that black criminal mac mac nigga 
 That pap! pap! me hittin a couple of rounds 
 And while I test him, hey fuck a Smith and Wesson 
 I got my, nine at my chest and I got my dime bag 
 Of stress weed, a 40 oz. of OE and I'm creepin' 
 Up on some niggas in a mob and a nigga claimin OG, 
 Pap! hit him in that dome and it was that nigga's worst 
 Put him on the ground wit a brain, full o' dem nine slugs 
 So wrap that nigga up, put him in a hearse 
 And I'm hittin 50, right around that curb, tight, 
 Rollin' up in a 64, 4 doors sideways to the next light (YOU KNOW) 
 An I hit that corner of 24 street, some nigga mean mugging 
 Lynch, and I pop in a clip and I'm not finna get got, 
 I'ma shoot before I'm shot for the fact I'm B-U-Double D-E-D 
 I'm reaching up in my glove box, for the welfare weed 
 That's fillin a nigga's siccness so I miss dead bodies 
 In an, oldsmobile, up on the curb and while I'm skirtin 
 Pass the view wit an empty 9 and some bourbon (riiight) 
 I just adjust to the fact that niggas ain't got no hope 
 I'm fillin 'em up with 16s, and letting 'em know 
 It's either that die, or that sickness, and it's the nigga that nigga that 
 One you come see, with that 9 millimeter meter watch them 9 millimeter meat 
 Wikkihdie come, Wikkihtah come, Wikkihtah come, Wikkihtah E-drop, styling, 
 If I don't get you with me nina then me, you, scream, 
 And two pop nigga that mine in the deuce for the deuce 
 Without them gun shells, firing, fidda them don't know me when me high 
 Off them doughshot killa weed, me take-a me nine millimeter nine, 
 And me blast him, enemy for the die, 'cause of dat siccness dem creep 
 And ten baumy and a them say 
 Load up that nine I'm finna finna go boom! 
 Them no dubbin up that nina cut them in half with some of them 
 Ripgut, quality, for the fundamental cannibalism 
 Got them black enemy runnin' in and when them, 
 Sickness kick in a million, baby dying, boom! 
 Hit 'em with my G like every day, nigga, 
 From the creek to the Garden Blocc, 
 I was creepin' from the double dead red till all the drama stop, 
 And 50 150 is all that shouldn't even be on a niggas list 
 'Cause since for the fuckin' with I've been crazy times 6 charging in '66 and um, 
 Niggas can't see my folk when I dump them .44 slugs all down they throat 
 It takes one time, all night, to peel your tonsols 
 From the phone post, you know, 
 All up in the cut with the real deuce deuce four love I got 
 But you know that nigga from the creek so peep at what this trigger got 
 Come follow me sin, come quick 'cause I'm bustin' all up on your, blocc 
 Shakin up yo nuts like dice deuce four in the don't strike twice 
 Them gon all go say "oh" about 44 times till so, 
 Much later than you go, better off dead, but nigga instead 
 That I let your mama know, she might wanna follow this Fahlivum shit 
 'Cause a nigga wont last much longer, with wraps in the cut 
 Chewin all on your nuts like my nigga Jeffrey Dahlmer, 
 Can't load that shit that sickness gets me harder than a corpse 
 Till I reach for the greeds that nigga start jackin off until it hurts 
 Swallow my shit so thick this nigga run loccs up on you almost daily 
 For the digs then I'm off dick grow soft with lynch I'm chewin up babies 
 We gonna stay sicc, for the crazy run 'em up gospel shit kicks in 
 It's the nigga named 6 with the locc to the brain style fix 
 Eatin up your dead skin
