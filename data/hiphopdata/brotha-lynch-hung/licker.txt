[Chorus] **Fades In** 
 So if you wanna get fucked up 
 Pour some licker in your cup 
 When you pass out or throw up homey 
 Then you had enough 
 And I don't wanna drink alone 
 Don't wanna go no home 
 Grab your cup and get fucked up 
 Toss it back and now it's on 
 (Eklypss) 
 Sittin' in the studio making up some proper beats 
 Drinkin' Ol' E, sippin Gin and some Hennessy 
 I hear a knockin' at the front door 
 Who could it be? A hoe? 
 Open up and I say, "Hey" 
 She got Courvoisier, Tanqueray and grandma lle 
 Enough to set the night off 
 So baby turn the light off 
 And take them panties right off 
 Let's get raw 
 Ooh I like the way your sippin on that glass of Tanqueray 
 Got the licker talkin' dirty words to me 
 Sayin', "Fuck me, I'm ready" 
 Pour me another shot of Henny 
 Before I hit that ass, I'm puttin' on a beanie 
 And proceed to bring that freak out up in her 
 Ain't nothin' that do that like licker 
 So if you wanna get fucked up 
 Pour some licker in your cup 
 When you pass out or throw up homey 
 Then you had enough 
 And I don't wanna drink alone 
 Don't wanna go no home 
 Grab your cup and get fucked up 
 Toss it back and now it's on 
 (Crook Cilla) 
 I started with the Ol' E 
 Then it graduated to the Hennessy VSOP 
 Rollin' blunts in a cheesy 
 Chokin on a steezy 
 Smoke that Tobacc for the weezy 
 Bend to the curb 
 G smash to the block, don't stop 
 Get another 5th and pop the top 
 Bless the bottle, hit the throttle 
 What's up to the folks, I'll see you tomorrow 
 Right now we good, I'm goin' to the woods 
 I got a little bitch with some Henny and bud 
 I can't get stuck 
 Drink lightly, Tonight might be the night she choose me 
 Dank with the Uzi 
 When I'm all this scummy and sloppy 
 Don't try to stop me, I'm not me 
 It's from the licker and fire weed 
 Can't stop drinkin' 
 What's wrong with me? 
 I know I can handle the weed 
 If I couldn't, I'd go to sleep 
 But this licker won't let me be 
 Far from the normal, I'm feelin' horrible 
 Hurl sensations got control 
 My stomach's swole, Full from the licker 
 Optimo's got my mind blowed 
 But I'm at this hoe 
 Tryin' to find out what the is she talkin' bout 
 Could it have been from her house? 
 Or could it have been from bustin' nuts in her mouth? 
 I done fucked around and got bit 
 Hit it more and I ain't gonna remember shit 
 I done drank too much 
 And now I'm sick, Fuckin' with this silly bitch 
 (Eklypss) 
 Let's go to the licker store 
 Call us up another hoe 
 Stack up on some alcohol 
 Before we make them coochie calls 
 Now I know I've been drinkin' but I don't give a fuck 
 I got two D.U.I.'s 
 I get one more, I'm stuck 
 Headed up the G-Times 
 Bitches on the way and they all fine 
 Six niggaz deep and we rollin' in a Lincoln 
 Everybody's drinkin' 
 Ooh I just can't wait to make it back 
 So we can get fucked up 
 Sittin' back with the honeys 
 Drinkin' with mami 
 I'm feelin' cool now 
 Know what to do now 
 Grab your broads and we headed to the room now 
 If you drink too much 
 Then your ass gonna get sicker 
 Don't nothing do that like licker 
 So if you wanna get fucked up 
 Pour some licker in your cup 
 When you pass out or throw up homey 
 Then you had enough 
 And I don't wanna drink alone 
 Don't wanna go no home 
 Grab your cup and get fucked up 
 Toss it back and now it's on
