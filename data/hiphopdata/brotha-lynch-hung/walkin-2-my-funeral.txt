(Brotha Lynch Hung) 
 Creeping in the dark with a nine and a four O 
 5 O 12 O clock so I creep slow duece fo 
 Homies know I just can't claim so I stay neutral 
 Pack me some ammo and a fothamukin fo fo 
 Can't pack a piece too often 
 End up having another suckas guts hanging off 
 And a 187 R.A.P. A.S.A.P. 
 Reeping off the fits doing time in the penitentary 
 And as I creep I peep mista locsta with the gun outta his holsta 
 Thinking he supposed to point it at me 
 But now everybody loves a cop killa 
 Just as bout' as much as a young capila 
 So what I did is grabe my nine but before I put the clip in 
 All I heard is pop pop pop what I'm tripping 
 My body's licking blood I can't call it 
 One time murdering a young alcoholic 
 I'm on the ground with a 40 spilled on my chest 
 Bullet holes and it supposed to work bullet proof vest 
 Caught slipping my niggaro's 
 You can burn that hearse 'cause Ima walk to my funeral 
 (Mia Bruce) 
 Can you feel 
 Can you feel it 
 You know what you got to do 
 Can you feel 
 Why don't you take 
 You know what you got to do 
 Can you feel 
 Why don't you take 
 Can you feel 
 (T.M. Shades) 
 I can't believe that I got shot I thought I ducked 
 I was just rolling my dice pressing my luck 
 Kicking it with them fellas drinking 40's on the block 
 Talking about what my dice will do when they drop 
 Then all of the sudden dam I think saw a gun 
 After I heard the bam that made everybody run 
 I'm trying to run but I ain't 'cause I'm falling 
 My body's getting numb 
 I hear my mother calling 
 My heart stops but it don't feel like I'm dead 
 And now I'm seeing black puzzled and surprised 
 My worst start nightmare was now realitized 
 And I didn't even get me a chance to say good bye to my mommy 
 Ambulance covering my body 
 Put me in the truck closed the door stuck a tag on my toe 
 And put me in a drawer case closed 
 Another inocent victim victimized 
 In the wrong place at the wrong time 
 My story was wrote the book read now I might be laying here dead 
 But Ima walk to my funeral 
 (Mia Bruce) 
 Can you feel 
 I want to know why don't you just listen to me 
 Why don't you listen to me 
 Can you feel 
 (Brotha Lynch Hung) 
 10 O clock at the set Lynch crept 
 Some nigga rolled up in a mob wanted a cigarette 
 Nuttining now I'm smoking on some indo 
 And on that note he stuck a gage out the window 
 Break yourself for that dank and your cash 
 Foo try to take my grip and then mash 
 I'm like what, heh 
 I'm not going out foo I bust out my ol school and swing my things real cool 
 So what up 
 I'm not tripping off your gage what up 
 Ain't even packing you the brotha with the gage at my gut 
 So bust he start loading me full of them shells 
 There wasn't no way I was dropping I'm bloody as hell 
 6 holes in my body and I'm trying to walk 
 Grave yard straight called me I'm living off a nerve shock 
 And on my tombstone 1996 
 And I got but I'm gonna strike to my funeral
