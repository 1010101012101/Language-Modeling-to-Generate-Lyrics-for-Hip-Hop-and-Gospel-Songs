 Say I got a split personality 
 The day time I'm cool Night time 
 No electricity, no car payment 
 Make me just wanna to rape shit 
 Scrape shit off the concrete and eat it 
 Believe it I can get devious like Lil' Bro 
 Criminal call me the cream of crop of Sacramento though 
 Why do they want to get severed up to many mini meat lits 
 Why every time I get drunk and high can't trust a nigga like a secret 
 So I commence to make the meat rip that's all I ever think about 
 Bellpeppers and hot sauce high blood pressure shit 
 Tell Lecter I eat it raw damn near rare 
 This album suppose to make you wanna eat spare ribs 
 I don't never wanna spare his life 
 Fuccin' rape his wife razor blade the kife ya 
 Sever your wife up watch the knife cut ya picture it like night time 
 I spit poison like a python, shit got to get the lights on 
 When the lights on human meats all over the room, blood all over the room 
 Siccle pysycho Siccle Cell Anemia just light up the ooze 
 I don't wanna say shit 
 I just wanna rape shit 
 I just wanna flay bitches 
 Night time day and night 
 Nitetime AK shit 
 My other half sayin' don't do it 
 But at close range split your brain shit 
 1 (I can't speak don't) 2 (I can say it) (X2)
