They disappeared, no * * * 
 Don't trust nobody, this shit is weird 
 This shit is real, I have to own it 
 At any moment, they could be on me 
 They have to die, at least in my eyes 
 I'm so surprised, I open my eyes 
 I seen it all, they think I ball 
 I'll never fall, not * * * 
 Them bodies gon' disappear 
 I'mma rip 'em in half, gettin' the last word in 
 I'mma sit in the back of the car at her job 
 When she get in car, I'mma attack her jaw 
 I'mma cut up the face and put her on the face and 
 Walk out the house with a machete like Jason 
 Kill her whole family, botox facelift 
 Nobody, no case, nobody, no face 
 Barbecue, * *, I'mma rape your taste 
 I mean, I'mma rape your mouth, bitch! I'mma take guts out 
 And I'mma put 'em in the oven, yeah, I'mma heat that 
 And * * * *, I'mma hold up the plate like, bitch, you late 
 They disappeared, no * * * 
 Don't trust nobody, this shit is weird

 We own neighborhoods like speed bumps, nigga 
 And I got that bloody face, sippin' on that *, nigga 
 And you want that season, nigga, where is that season, nigga? 
 I'm a misfit and I spit shit like I just got the fever, nigga 
 And I stay lit like Michael 
 Plus, I smoke like a chimney, enemies get 
 Fuck all the hatred 
 Even if these niggas is steadily 
 These niggas is 
 They don't wanna get in the ring with Ali 
 I might be leavin' 'em bleedin', no I.D. 
 Nigga, I 
 They disappeared, no * * *
