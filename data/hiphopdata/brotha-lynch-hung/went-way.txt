Two years ago, a friend of mine 
 Told me to write me a tight ass rhyme 
 And so I, I wrote this rhyme that I am about to say 
 The rhyme is tight and it went this way 
 And I'm on my briefcase wit some crumbled weed 
 Shystie niggas keep staring at me 
 I had my 45 and my 44 
 I put one on my briefcase so them niggas'll know 
 Lives get took 
 That's it just like a book 
 Do you want a meathook 
 Smoke a fat blunt on my couch wit my feet up while you get took 
 Fo yo skrill 
 Hundred dolla bill 
 Take yo pill muthafucka 
 While you bullshitin dis shit is real 
 I ain't no twelve inch 
 Can't mix me up in this shit 
 I got full clips 
 And alone I do my shit 
 So trust me you information faulty 
 And I wouldn't eat you cause your meat's too salty 
 I'd rather, step through a fire ring wit some gasoline draws than fuck wit you 
 Cause you the type of nigga that'll tell'em everything you saw, wit my 
 Big bad forty auto mag 
 Twenty sac nigga get yo money back if you don't think you of that sliznack 
 Motivated, totally undominated 
 I got that sickness and the remedy, my momma made it 
 Easy fo me I didn't have to work 
 Fourteen years old in the backseat drinkin' o.e. like kirk 
 Now just the other day a friend of mine 
 Told me to write me a tight ass rhyme 
 And so i, I wrote this ryhme that I'm about to say 
 The rhyme is tight and it went this way 
 I know it's been a long time, I shouldn't left you 
 Without a tight rhyme to step to 
 Think of all them weak ass albums you slept through 
 Well I'm yo medicine, sorry I kept you 
 Went to my brother's house, without a doubt 
 Twisted one up with the nigga, smoked'em out 
 Got to writin some of dat sicc made my own bacc fade type script 
 High enough to write a whole career full of shit 
 I mean blitzed, toe up, drug cost up, ready to fuck, throw up 
 Man I got my cheddah cheese ass nigga know what 
 I don't hold no grudges I just ain't fuckin' wit you no mo, mission stay 
 Sicc made and don't let nothin' penetrate my barracade 
 Barracade barracade barracade, barracade
