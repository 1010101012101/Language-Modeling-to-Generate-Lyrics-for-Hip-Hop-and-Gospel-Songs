(Feat. Erick Sermon) 
 (E-Dub) The Bo$, you suckers! 
 (Bo$) 
 I'm comin' to getcha (yeah) 
 Tonight when you sleep creepin' steady but quick 
 I'm here to tell 'em, that B ain't no petty bitch 
 You run up, you're gettin' stuck - what was goin' through your mind 
 When you thought, over Bo$, you could ever fuck? (you could EVER fuck) 
 So nut up, whassup is I'ma drop fat gun blast 
 In the gash in that ass if I find 'em I got 'em 
 Takin' cover from the killin' 
 And body bags is the only motherfuckin thang I'm fillin (yeah) 
 The spunk villain kill forty ounce by the neck 
 And it's kept on a ninety degree tilt 
 For me and my, diggy D-O-G's, doin' dirt with ease 
 Shoulda got with that, niggaz can't fuck wit deez (can't fuck wit deez) 
 Bitches straight pimpin' 
 Ain't no simps, and so the gang ain't simpin, it's a bitch thang 
 And step to this one how I figure 
 From six feet deep you push daisies and that ain't no maybe, nigga 
 So step in my set and get yo' ass fucked up when I hitcha 
 (How you comin'?) I'm comin' to getcha 
 (Bo$) Runnin' and runnin' and gunnin and comin' to getcha (x3) 
 (EDub) Yo, she's come to get ya, uh 
 (Bo$) Runnin' and runnin' and gunnin and comin' to getcha (x3) 
 (EDub) Yo, she's come to get ya, kick it 
 (Bo$) 
 There they go, down the block, got the glock cocked, here we come 
 Straight rollin' in from the streets of the boondocks 
 Lettin mo' than just a little go 
 Gunnin punks down - then bailin back to the vehicle 
 Then that's when heads start swellin 
 You ain't been told; somebody better fuckin' tell 'em 
 'Bout the motherfuckin misfits, out on that other shit 
 Goin' all out, and doin' much dirt on the killin' tip (much dirt) 
 So save the rest for the next nigga 
 I was born to start trouble so they labelled me a gravedigger 
 And if the five-oh step, that's when I blast another 
 Twenty question askin punk cop motherfucker (yeah) 
 Don't make your move before you think 
 And fuck the judge, the jury and the god damn precinct 
 So you can see the total picture 
 Watch your back cause the fact is that Bo$ is like comin' to getcha 
 (E-Dub) 
 Now check one two, E caught the flu 
 Funky with the style, some say I'm buckwild 
 But step off and check out the Bo$ 
 You suckers and crab motherfuckers! 
 Yo, she's comin' to getcha 
 (Bo$) 
 See most bitches don't fit 
 In the category of a criminal gettin' paid (yeah) 
 Where comin' up is manditory 
 Where nothing's fallin' but the motherfuckin rain 
 And nothing's changed but the weather 
 Cause life in the ghetto still ain't gettin' no better 
 I'm takin' a knot fo' a knot, throwin' heavy hits 
 Then you wonder why it's yo' ass that I'm comin' to get 
 'Cause what I got I simply took a crook that takes it to the limit 
 Life's already a bitch - without me in it 
 I commence to make dollars and sense, pump lead 
 Only evidence, another ditch another nigga dead 
 If you a homie cap peeled if you play homies 
 Never stay homies long anyway, fuck it 
 See some be throwin' for bullshit, that must mean on some night 
 I'll take yo' ass out with just one shot 
 So when you duck from the bullets I won't give a fuck 
 You shoulda died before they hitcha, I'm comin' to getcha
