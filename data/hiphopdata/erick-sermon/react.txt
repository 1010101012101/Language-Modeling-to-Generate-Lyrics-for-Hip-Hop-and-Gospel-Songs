Just Blaze, yeah, uh, yeah 
 Check me out now 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo, check me out now 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 Let me hear ya say 
 Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh 
 Kisi ko 
 Khudkushi ka shok ho to 
 Kya kare tu? 
 Put your hands in the air everybody, c'mon 
 Where them dogs at 
 (Erick Sermon) 
 Hey yo, I'm immaculate, come through masculine 
 Wide-body frame, E-Dub's the name, whoa 
 In the field of rap, I'm supurb, I'm fly 
 I should be in the sky with birds 
 I ride 20 inch rims when I lean, yo 
 (Ayyo, them 10's) 
 I know, I keep 'em clean though 
 Come through stormin' the block like El Nino 
 Scoop up an average chick before she close 
 She goes, KISI KO those my people 
 Yeah, them broads from Puerto Rico, them key folks 
 Yeah, watch how the "E" locs 64 
 Black rags, black interior, shift on the floor 
 Burn out, I do it for the kids 
 They're hoppin' it turn style, the "E" goin' wild 
 Yo, like them white chicks on a DVD 
 Yeah, I'm worldwide, MTV and BET 
 Kisi ko 
 Khudkushi ka shok ho to 
 Kya kare tu? 
 (1) 
 Whateva' she said, then I'm that 
 If this here rocks to y'all, then react 
 Kisi ko 
 Khudkhusi ka shok ho to 
 Kya kare tu? 
 Whateva' she said, then I'm that 
 If this here rocks to y'all, then react 
 Yo, do I gotta go ape or go nutty 
 I leave your eye like a 9-9 biz-buggy, puffy 
 Brit niggas get real ugly 
 Trust me, keep your four if you feel lucky 
 Mug me, I ain't got nothin' but four figures 
 And weed and hash chopped in the coffee blender 
 My shots like squeegy men on your window 
 Usual suspect, I'm the crippled member 
 Get away when I sat down in the office 
 Heat in my lap keep me walkin' awkward 
 While y'all talk it, the doc reinforce it 
 The mic, it's hard to keep my paws off it 
 Yo' bitch is my bitch when it's over 
 No Cristal, I'll pour duck with King Cobra 
 Out in the Nova, don't bother 
 My knee not brown, cost is a shot down the Carter 
 Kisi ko 
 Khushusi ka shok ho to 
 Kya kare tu? 
 Hey yo Red, he's over (Word?) with his shit right now 
 Watch this, told ya 
 Chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chillin', I'm milk 
 I'm that kid Gizmo, we top billin' 
 Yo, when the roof is on fire, believe it, it's me 
 Sparks when I rock the mic like Siegal and Free 
 When the pen hit the pad, the evil in me come out 
 Total recall for people to breathe 
 I got dogs in the backyard shittin' their lawns 
 We got chickens ain't leaving till six in the morning 
 Round and round we go, circle the area 
 Leave the party, go straight to the Marriott 
 Dozy-doe, we're cowboys with a saddle-lac 
 Rodeo with 20 fours on the Cadillac 
 What your name is, yo, R.E.D. 
 Crack cost money, but the "E" is free, yeah 
 Repeat (1) until fade.
