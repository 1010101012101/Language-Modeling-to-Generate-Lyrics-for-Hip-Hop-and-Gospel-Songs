(Erick Sermon) 
 Hey young world, one two, one two 
 Check it out y'all 
 Uh, Shadz of Lingo in the house 
 E Double's in the house with Def Squad 
 On the funky fresh track with Shadz of Lingo 
 Mic check one two, yo you got my nerves jumpin' around 
 And Humpin' Around like Bobby Brown across town 
 I ain't with that, so don't cramp my style 
 Step off me, I'm hyped like I had a pound of coffee 
 Yo how could you ask what I'm doin' 
 When I'm pursuin, gettin' funky with my crew and 
 My input brings vibes unknown like E.T. 
 Makes me phone home to my family 
 Cling, hello mom, I'm doin' it, freakin more fame 
 Than Batman played by Michael Keaton 
 I crossed over, let me name someone that's black 
 With fame, and pockets that are fat 
 Hey, Erick Sermon, he's one 
 Packs a gun, that's bigger than Malcolm's 
 Out the window, I look for a punk to get stupid 
 So I can shoot his ass like Cupid 
 E 2 bingos, down with the Shadz of Lingo 
 Here to bust out the funky single 
 Ah shit, there goes my pager 
 I'll see you later, because yo 
 Chorus: Erick Sermon 
 Every now and then, I get a little crazy (4X) 
 (Shadz of Lingo - 1) 
 One two how can I do it? I guess I'll spit the real 
 Yo I pack much dick, with the cover made of steel hoe 
 Yes yes, never fessed or settled for less 
 One clown stepped, and got a hole in the fuckin' chest 
 From the A.K., somebody scream MAYDAY 
 Took the sucker out, 'cause he clowned me on a payday 
 The funk is flowin to the maximum 
 From the E Double, while I kick the facts to them 
 Check a chill brother with class, rough enough 
 To run up and snatch the spine out a niggaz ass 
 Grip the steel when caps peeled, here to chill on the real 
 And don't give a motherfuck how you feel 
 Thinkin' you're steppin to this, I kinda doubt it 
 Ain't with the bullshit, so you can write a fuckin' book about it 
 The big nigga with the bud and I'm on that 
 E kick the beat and yo you shoulda known that 
 (Shadz of Lingo - 2) 
 Yo it's the Lingo of the Shadz 
 Droppin' that mellow but mad mackadocious 
 Melodious metaphorical music with mo' shit 
 That you used to, and stylin that you ain't 
 What else I got to do but draw the pictures with paints? 
 {*Feedback*} Oh no, there's my mic squeakin 
 A soundman's body turnin' up every weekend 
 Some think I done the killin', you know I can't remember 
 I can't recall a full week since this past December 
 And mics catchin fire 'fore I get the chance to touch em 
 Yo Al. B catch the buddha lightin torches, I'ma bust em 
 But don't rush em, leave the pyromaniac alone he heard the words 
 To hit 'em on the red dot and knows I'm thinkin' bout MURDER 
 Run {run} hide {hide} you can't {can't} escape {scape} 
 The hit {the hit's} on, I got the {got the} papes {papes} 
 Dodge {dodge} red {red} lasers {lasers} scannin {scannin} 
 Brings {brings} fly {fly when} rhymes {rhymes} landin {landin} 
 Let me go ... no ... yo, I'm straight {straight} 
 Chill {chill}, yo I need AUHHHH, air, wait {wait} 
 Cross {cross} fade {fade's} a killer {killer} style and {style and} 
 Where's the {where's the} soundman 
 Tell me {tell me} was I whylin {whylin} 
 Cause {cause}
