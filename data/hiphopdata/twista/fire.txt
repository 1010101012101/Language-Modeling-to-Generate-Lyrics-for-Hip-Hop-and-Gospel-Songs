 Go and get a pillow and a cigerillo if I know it's the killa I'm yellin' roll one up joe 
 Open the backwood up trippin' on me 'cause I was sloppy I better get fucked up though

 But y'all might call it the granddad better saver it and take a pull slowly 
 Eye lids low ain't no doubt about it that somebodys gon peep me 
 Go ahead and ride I think I'mma chill because I'm kinda sleepy 
 Me and my niggas in my crew will get into it now we be at odds hardly 
 'Cause we smokin' on a ounce of the ganja that bob marley 
 Me a rock to the reggae music whenever me feel the spliff workin 
 Kill off in any rudeboy if ya take away my herb its da earth sin. 
 Smokin' on dat fire (smokin' on dat fire) 
 Puffin on dat dro (puffin on dat dro)
