(Tung Twista) 
 Relaxin maxin to the maximum 
 To tracks a hum 
 The wicks where the stacks are from 
 Inside the styles of a funky lyrical wiz 
 What a miracle is 
 Get down to spiritual business 
 Now my tongue kissed 
 Put words in your system wished em 
 Respect the blackness em 
 Give in 'em win 'em the peace they want 
 But don't want the peace signs unless its in the mind 
 Become a victim because I kick 'em sick em 
 Supposed to be black but they be wack 
 Those who pretend to be a muslim I gooshed em 
 Positive ones I pushed em 
 Into the path or righteousness might get dissed 
 Those who pump a fist but ain't right with this 
 I increase rhymes wacks and weak minds 
 If it ain't real stop throwin' up peace signs 
 Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart 
 Untied we can get over, yet were still apart 
 Terror wished 'em ima terrorize elorize in disguise 
 Those for side for tizin and I begin 
 To creepin' seepin thought out unrighteousness and dissed 
 Connect of venomous gangs with the rhytmness 
 Figured they manifestin g I can address 
 Individually each emcee is throwin' up peace but don't pray to the east 
 I write the lect the soul should be playin' towards mecca 
 But snakes and devils wont letcha 
 Freestyle some religious free dump see 
 To letcha know how come dumb some be 
 Ignorance a comish to look like a fish 
 And since we whipped from bars to a ghetto priz 
 Ima wiz some brains I give 'em a brain washin 
 When I'm walkin' devils I'm squashin 
 Science fiction mixed in tricks in fixin 
 The ways of all sort for good 
 Come in my fortress ima gonna force this 
 'Cause it holy don't try to fold me 
 Some just say peace tryin' to the black guy 
 Some say peace thinkin' it means bye bye 
 So g if ya never mean this from the heart and the mind 
 Stop throwin' up peace signs 
 Lets walk the path of a vo-cab-ulary 
 You'll cary the thoughts of every righteous man 
 Lets fight this plan of a other man 
 Waxin thoughts of a brother man 
 Satans waitin for us to be hatin' each other 
 Sister brother or mother color 
 Blackness don't try to attack this fact this lets now practice 
 True peace new salon one who is a peace 
 Cease when you see hunger than give peace 
 Blacks a supplied them and applied them identified them 
 You suffer inhale and say why them 
 'Cause you did not follow the path that I laid out 
 Say blackness and get played out 
 Like children wildin some try to kick a fist 
 Pick a fist I take a piss wikedness to get crushed up 
 Movin up on that bustop while stand inhale bustop 
 So you must stop 
 Fakin the holy faith in wakin' 
 Star don't come apart our hearts get a stake in 
 So don't be mad so what minds to the minimum 
 'Cause in the 'em sendin 'em holy wisdom 
 To let you know from the heart and the mind 
 Stop throwin' up peace signs
