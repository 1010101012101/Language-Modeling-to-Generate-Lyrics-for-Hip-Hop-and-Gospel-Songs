Always ever all days death before dishonor 
 Comin' back as though I can still see if you got static 
 Fuck tryin' to steal me shit you gon' have to kill me 
 And if somebody cappin Ima tell 'em what happens when my emotions erupt 
 Shots make me duck that's when Ima have to fuck you up 
 It's like uh ah muthafucka can't fight the feelin' the way Ima fuck em 
 Have an orgasm but for the orchasm hit 'em as if a 4-5 buck em 
 Talk about a man being scared, I done killed him be dead in his tomb 
 Still shakin 
 Hit 'em in his body and his head, now be found in heaven with the wound 
 Still achin' 
 I wonder if his voice still breakin' 
 Better be 'cause I steadily 
 Hit him with gats and styles that heavily 
 Armed and dangerous and deadily 
 That ahead of me receive two holes like the letter B 
 Better you instead of me, breakin peace can increase your chances 
 To delete your advances for slate I can paint this piece on canvas 
 With a paint brush that a nigga can't truss like a god so I can't rush 
 Wont crush 
 If you ever heard about a crew that can't bust then motherfucker it 
 Ain't us; don't touch 
 A mike or a gun if you ain't gonna use it, 
 Do it 
 Claiming your weapons and tecs and you gonna be checked and fluid 
 Prove it 
 'Cause no matter who it is can't tell the westside to leave a bitch shedding 
 Tears 
 The young kill everyday the old itchin to kill 'cause they ain't offed 
 A nigga dead in years 
 Shoot him dead in his, this style of flow is a verbal calico 
 Make a chest ripple 
 They get a call from the sky sayin' they all gonna die 
 Don't leave the rest crippled 
 Mikers, mikers be tryin' to take mine and leave a motherfucker 
 Cold as a crisis 
 With a technique as cold as isis, and mikes as my control devices 
 Or do I gotta get off some nigga shit 
 Show the biggest dick with the biggest clique that be hazardous if 
 I let the trigga click 
 You don't benefit if a nigga get from the rage if he live it just a 
 Little bit; so go on with the riddle shit 
 If you got something to stress then get it off your chest and 
 We can take it to the middle bitch 
 And go on get it on and I bet you that the outcome is that I'm leavin' 
 Niggas out done, cut up 
 But its odd to see a motherfucker outrun just because he let his 
 Mouth run so shut up 
 And sit back if you know what's good for you I can still overthrow you 
 I don't give a fuck about the fact that the hood know you 
 Don't make a nigga have to show you 
 That Ima die before you make an ass of me stop as if you took a blast 
 At me and cause tragedy 
 That was how it was that was how it is and that's the way it has to be 
 It's like uh, ah, sit back and let the shit just straight marinate 
 I pull the stage curtain back like norman bates 
 Performin hates smokin' on some reefer performin fate 
 It's a constant struggle for us white boys with the shit hittin licks 
 In the scuffle for us 
 My nigga lucky made him bleed fear is if to proceed to bust 
 If he a different type of breed from us 
 So y'all petty niggas need to hush; two straight to you brain means pains 
 Inflicted 
 Even if it ain't things to taunt pain like rage till my brain is wicked 
 Ain't even lived out a quarter of your lifetime tryin' to push product 
 And ain't servin' the right kind and ain't strivin the right rhymes 
 But Ima shorten your lifeline 
 Through the pipeline I vocal cold bust 'em plus them with killers 
 Jaw stealers throw dealers rushin parties bloody body chillers 
 Pretty casket fillers 
 'Cause those niggas got they shit together 
 We come pay to Creator's Way and don't gotta be but then again whatever
