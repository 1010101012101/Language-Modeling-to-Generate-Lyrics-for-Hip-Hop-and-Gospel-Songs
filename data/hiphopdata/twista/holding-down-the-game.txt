Chi town balla, K town nigga 
 Gunnin threw the streets with my hand on the trigga 
 And on the block smokin' weed with hash when I breeze past 
 I'm bout to run threw the game like I was steve nash 
 Naw naw T naw I feel that shit man but we gotta come with some of that origianal twista shit you know 
 Some of that chi town playa shit you know you know that old shit man lets kick that shit T 
 All right I got ya cause 
 (Verse One) 
 Take a look at my Impala 
 Take a look at my chevy capris 
 Now take a look at my platinum blue 500 benz rolling through the streets 
 In the city of the GO 
 Shit making money is the mission 
 I'm a glistenin killin' off the competition 
 Steady tipping cause of how I be pimpin' hoes 
 Now I know just how to treat 'em 'cause I need em 
 I don't really got to beat 'em so we cool 
 As long as they bring me my money. 
 Got 'em walkin' servin' ass with a passion while I'm talkin' better never see you laughin' 
 Know I gotta show 'em ain't a damn thing funny 
 Twista got game 
 Finna spit it to 'em hard 
 Get your dame 
 Put her on the boulevard 
 Now I got er in training with my bottom bitch 
 She can learn a lot a shit 
 Like how to get it on a stroll 
 Be in control and shit on the other hoes 
 And be able to get fetti fo daddy from a lot a tricks 
 But the thump bumpin speakers in the trunk 
 Cause a nigga have to cop a little some some 
 Leavin' niggas bodies slump when I let the thump a dump 
 If I ever catch you fukin with the bump bump 
 Like a diamond I'm flawless 
 Ain't no fucking with rawest 
 When you enter my vicinity better be cautious 
 If you into makin' money step into my office 
 Makin' hoes close shop 
 My flow came got the block hot 
 Took the tens got me super through the city in the drop top 
 Screamin out I just don't give a fuck 
 I'm the chief in the booth from when you see me coming through with the crew 
 Make you do what to do 
 I'm a win for the city 
 For the chi till I die cause there's just no givin' up. 
 I'm holdin' down the game 
 What would you be hatin' for 
 I'm a playa from the go with the shit that you've been waitin for 
 I'm holdin' down the game 
 Show me how you get buck the momma 
 You can make a buck the momma 
 Niggas out here like to fuck the momma 
 (Verse Two) 
 Take a look at my japer 
 Now come look at the diamonds up in the ears 
 Now come take a look at the gators, jumpers and raw 50 had crocadile on the bib and the ice on my charm 
 Man I'm no joke came up big in the 04 
 Now as fast I can kill 'em with the slow flow 
 Specially if I been smokin' that hydrogen bomb. 
 Shit man now that's what I'm talking about now that's that origianl twist right there man 
 Man but you know what man lets slow it down man and take it down south houston style cause 
 (Verse Three) 
 Chi town balla 
 K town nigga 
 Runnin' through the street with my hand on the trigga 
 And on the block smokin' weed with hash when I breeze pass 
 I'm bout to run through this game like I was steve nash 
 Ain't no fuckin' with the twista when I toss words 
 That's the 22 up against a moss berg 
 Feel the thump in your trunk from the fatti chacer 
 Say me your sir radius nigga call me gladiator 
 Spittin' smooth words at a smooth pace 
 2 times stronger than them bitches call me screw face 
 You fuckin' with a real ass nigga 
 Stompin poppers tryin' to make 'em bigger
