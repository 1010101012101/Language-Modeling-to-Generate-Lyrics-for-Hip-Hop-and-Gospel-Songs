Here I am... here I am 
 Here I am... ummm... here I am 
 Here I am... come and get me. 
 On a rainy dark day early morn, 
 A lethal legacy was born, 
 Ask any rapper around 
 'Bout the fuckin' mics I left torn 
 But they won't give me all my P's 
 And I won't leave the Chi to get G's 
 Got love for my MCs at home 
 But some of them still hate on me 
 Look how many years I done repped 
 Hustled through the streets and the Go 
 Inspired by the first rappers ever 
 Signed a contract a decade ago 
 Put Chi name on records in the East 
 Put Chi name on records in the West 
 Put Chi name on records in the South 
 B**** how you gone open yo mouth 
 To the mutha f***ers' industry 
 Why you hate on me and my city 
 Will it be an imbalance of power if y'all let Chi niggas get G's 
 Or is it us holdin' us back 
 Think hard when you rollin' yo sack 
 Whatever the case my Chi nigga 
 If it's in my means I got yo back 
 What the f***'s really going on 
 Does he bite 'cause he know he on 
 Don't he know I already established myself as Twista Coleone 
 Well I'm holdin' my city down 
 Ain't goin' nowhere here I stand 
 You know where I am 
 If you hate me (come and get me) 
 If you want me (come and get me) 
 Here I am 
 Here I am... ummm... here I am 
 Here I am... ummm... here I am 
 Here I am... ummm... here I am 
 Here I am... come and get me... come and get me 
 What did I do to deserve 
 All of this madness around me 
 Found me in the studio buryin' myself in work smokin' herb 
 Tried to kick me to the curb 
 To the back 
 To the ditch 
 To the dump 
 To the shack 
 But I sprint 
 In the front 
 In a Lac 
 With a fifth and a blunt 
 And I'm back 
 In the b**** wit a pump 
 And I'm ready to bust at you h**s 
 Ready to dump lames in ditches 
 Steady makin' fakers bleed 
 LB family handle business 
 Come and enter Twista's realm 
 Journey wit me through the pain 
 The hurt just might make you invision drama that can turn you insane 
 How much of my chaos bring tears 
 How many threaten my career 
 How many threatin' to murder me but b**** you know where I live 
 Who the f*** do you think I is 
 Y'all ain't comin' at no lil shawty 
 Why you think you can't hurt like these years 
 Joe why my lil P's got you soft 
 Think you finna' bring out my fears 
 Tell me why my success make you cry 
 And why my downfalls make you laugh 
 But I bet my hydro got you high 
 Never let hate back me down 
 Stand firm like a man 
 If you want me (come and get me) 
 Wanna kill me (come and get me) 
 Here I am 
 Here I am... ummm... here I am 
 Here I am... ummm... here I am 
 Here I am... ummm... here I am 
 Here I am... come and get me... come and get me 
 We got geo like Neo and of course we as sourcy as Morpheus 
 Or we as sick as Sir Marcus aralias, alias, atheist 
 Against niggas who flow be the achiest 
 Against the aliens and why they hate me is maybe it's 'cause I'm controlin' this radius 
 Of this world and this whole universe 
 Don't believe let me spit you a verse 
 Just when you thought you was worse 
 I come wit words that'll make you disperse 
 My allies know I'm too cold 
 My enemies know I spit fast 
 My lords know I bust that thang 
 My gangsta's know I'll whoop some ass 
 Mobster family steady ride 
 LB family steady click 
 When us and other crews collide 
 Choose ya weapon take a pick 
 Load up, click clack, it's on 
 Finna' bust, get back, run home 
 Come at me bogus get whacked... wit a strap... to the back... of the dome 
 Industry niggas get gone 
 Heard y'all be speakin' big words 
 I'll show you some s*** that'll a blow you down, slow you down, like you sip syrup 
 It's Chi sacrificial lamb 
 Right here I stand firm 
 If you hate (come and get me) 
 If you want me (come and get me) 
 Here I am 
 Here I am... ummm... here I am 
 Here I am... ummm... here I am 
 Here I am... ummm... here I am 
 Here I am... come and get me... come and get me
