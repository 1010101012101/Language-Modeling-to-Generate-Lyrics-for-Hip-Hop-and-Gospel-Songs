 Here's the tale of a young black male 
 Raised in these city streets 
 Out here hustling to make ends meet 
 In a world that's so corrupt 
 That's ran by greed 
 Money and the power 
 For me I'm a survivor 
 I do what I have to and only God can judge me for that 
 So before you cash your stones down on me 
 I want you to take a look at yourself in the mirror 
 And ask somebody to pray for you 
 Cause that's all I'm asking is to pray for me, understand 
 I was born around gangstas, hustlers, and killers 
 Drug dealers with math figures making hella scrilla 
 In the city of Chi the home of the G's 
 If ya don't work ya don't eat that's been the code of the streets 
 As for me I was brought up at an early age 
 Learned how to cook cane started to gang bang 
 And it's a damn shame I chose game 
 But see I'ma knuckle headed nigga with no one to blame 
 And I'ma gonna keep on tipping under the street lights 
 And be wondering which nigga wanna take my life 
 Until then I'm staying two feet in front of you haters 
 I'm living the street life 
 And I just can't get away 
 I don't know if I'ma gonna make it to another day 
 So everynight I pray 
 Oh I pray 
 I'm living the street life 
 And I just can't get away 
 I don't know if I'ma gonna make it to another day 
 So everynight I pray 
 Well I'm surrounded by rats, roaches, and dope fiends 
 My whole world is being weighed up on a triple beam 
 Man I don't know what's in store for me god 
 Will I reach 21 
 Why is life so damn hard 
 See that's the question that's asked 
 And is there a heaven or hell can the young black live 
 Or will he be chained in the cell 
 I don't know as for me I only trusted a few 
 I had to hustle to survive now what else could I do 
 They say there's chances for everybody that's bullshit 
 That little girl had no chance when that bullet hit 
 I mean it blew to the sky 
 And all you heard was a cry 
 Oh lord don't let my baby die 
 Till the day that I die I'll stay true to my neighborhood 
 Fuck with my neighborhood nigga I wish you would 
 Ain't shit changed like oh once said 
 And oh no fool my nigga Fred ain't dead 
 Neither is Pook or Kansas City 
 True og's still here with me 
 My homie boo, boo what up 
 And you know I can't forget about my nigga, nigga Novesnake 
 Nightime boats and herbie 
 Shine and Cherelle would ya pray for me 
 I rock genue death so dam sensless 
 Big houses what the fucking radio been missing 
 And there's one more nigga that be true to my heart 
 Mr. Motion you the reason while I'm breaking 'em off 
 So our 
 I peed 'em to dead 
 Whole reason was love 
 To that nigga twist for believing in me 
 I got a shorty to feed 
 My priority is to make sure this shit don't have to struggle like me 
 And if I could ask for one more wish 
 I tell 'em I wanna hug ya 'cause I'm missing ya since 
 So I'm asking to pray for me 
 Mamma pray for me 
 Daddy pray for me 
 Baby pray for me 
 Please pray for me 
 Pray for me 
 Pray for me 
 Pray for me
