(Featuring Johnny P) 
 (Johnny P) 
 Yeah do you want to ride with me 
 Ooh ooh 
 Never can't you take my deal ooh... 
 I bet you would have lit while I hit on the blunt 
 Your pager goin' off (oh that ain't nuttin') 
 Meet me at the crib bout' 2 stop frontin' 
 Blow to the bone and the click'em some 
 Caddy gotta be out there tricks on somethin' 
 The corner of the party where the niggas straight bumpin' 
 This is for the gin and the hen in my stomach 
 I'm lookin' at the dope females still comin' 
 Lookin' to my left and the beats still comin' 
 Lookin' to my right and the drinks still comin' 
 Tryin' to shake the dice but the girl lookin' cunnin' 
 Shot for the door 
 Where the money start runnin' 
 To a pause, he y'all wassup a hey hummin' to the double I proceed to 
 As I proceeded to the car pulled over to the car 
 So I asked to proceeds to pass the pees 
 Low cash. 
 Chorus (Johnny P) x4 
 Do you want to ride with me 
 Do you want to smoke my weed 
 Never used to take my G 
 I'm a Po P-I-M-P 
 Want to be like P-I-M-P hoes plenty 
 Comin' straight from the windy 
 Choppin' up tens and twenty's huh 
 Lean back in the corner with the dob hat 
 Now my religion is to ball like a democrat 
 In the club with hoes (??) the nigga with a hood rat 
 Gotta dump hat 
 You call her what you want even all that 
 I been taught by the best 
 So put it to rest 
 And I confess 
 I may be just a ball black 
 Gettin' paid in the game and you won't friend 
 Flippin' pennies to a thug 
 I'm like an O-G 
 Go to the mall 
 With all of y'all 
 Show you some cash, now 
 Tell me what you want to be 
 Get around in the smoke in a cadillac 
 AC, windows down will you top that 
 From a Caddy to Lex the Rolex 
 I'm a put in a roll 
 Tell me could you top that 
 Ever though I'm makin' money and a wring friend 
 Nigga die morphine on the pro-scene 
 If you do, we could have sex 
 In the Caddy or Lex 
 But keep on the low, key 
 Will a motherfucker just say I might be broke 
 But now I'm stackin' see-note, steal dope 
 Different strokes, same folks 
 Hangin' from a rope 
 Me and Do or Die 
 Just try to cope 
 Sit back I'm a take a picture take a toke 
 Take a stroll through the hood 
 Some hatas but it's still all good 
 Roll up another bad boy 
 Playa pimpin' to the groove 
 And the pistol be the single rockin' shoes 
 Now it's time for me to make a move 
 Shotry what's the lead 
 (Twista) 
 I'd a seen a sexy walk on the far side 
 So don't be passin' me by 
 I'm a nigga with peas 
 And I an't stingy with trees 
 We could be some freeks and both of our ass could be high 
 Fiends drip, sell us with the octane 
 With pimp status as a hot name 
 We don't gotta pop thangs 
 No more servin' the white cane 
 'Cause I came pimpin' flow like hoes which is a glock game 
 It's like, aww sicky sickyny 
 Looky here sicky phrase while I trace on my old road 
 To find words form the pimp scroll 
 Get the bitch if I'm walkin' and she peepin' that my lips cold 
 See a playa go trippin' 
 People (??) try to play because slow vision 
 Picture how I'm mackin' cold women 
 View the grin my hair spinnin' 
 While we smokin' on henness 
 Still Po Pimpin'
