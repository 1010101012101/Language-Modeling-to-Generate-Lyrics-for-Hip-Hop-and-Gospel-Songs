Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 Okie dokie, alky keep it lowkey like thor lil bro 
 Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour saudi 
 Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote 
 If I sip any henny, my belly just mght be outtie 
 Pull up inside a huggy, starsky and hutch a dougie 
 I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky 
 Tonight she just yelling "fuck me", two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me 
 Used to like orange cassette tapes with timmy, tommy, and chuckie 
 And chuck e. cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me 
 Put visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me 
 Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me 
 My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (blam!) 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I will 
 Smoke a little something but I don't inhale, everywhere that I go, everywhere 
 They be asking how's it going, say the goings well, go figure, victor's light skinned 
 Jesus got me feeling like colin powell, all praise to the god, god knows 
 He's a pro, he's a pro like cointel, check, check mate, check me 
 Take me to the bedroom, let you know me well, I mean normally, you see 
 Norma jean wouldn't kick it with farmer phil, but these kids these days, they get so 
 High, burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, till they can't feel shit, shit-faced 
 Faced it, 15 hits on this l elevated, train, and the craziest 
 Thing, got me feeling like lauryn hill, miseducated, my dick delegated 
 Rap bill bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it, probably shoulda been dead or in jail 
 Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz, asshole, absinthe up in that class 
 Are we there yet? ice cubes in a bong, we're brain dead, take a tug and then pass 
 I think we all addicted 
 Yeah, I think we all addicted 
 Really though, I think we all addicted 
 I think we addicted 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter 
 Two seats used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi 
 Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie 
 I ended up on an album cover in a coogi 
 You see, I be still a god but a goofy 
 You be flowing about drugs and a uzi 
 That's the new principle, sometimes I'mma be about some hoes 
 Sometimes I'mma wanna make a movie 
 And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the higgs boson 
 And though my style freakish 
 I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did voltron 
 'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a og 
 Know me, I'm the obi-wan kenobi of the dope see 
 Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics 
 Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key 
 Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing 
 If I don't know what I miss is 
 Ima end up figuring out that it's home 
 And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses 
 This is just a testament to the ones that raised me 
 The ones that I praise and I'm thanking 
 I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes 
 And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking 
 Never too old for a spanking, igh 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my memories my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
 I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
 I miss my cocoa butter kisses
