 (Verse 1: Twista) 
 This is why I'm cold, 'cause I'm a chain flicker 
 I can sell a million just by telling 'em it's Twista 
 I represent the Midwest this is where it's at 
 We comin' and Nelly and Eminem and Kanye West we got that crack 
 I love the dirty 'cause the drop remind me of K-Town 
 Full of sheisty ass niggas, but the true ones gon' stay down 
 But on the East Coast they want lyrics in the door 
 So I get up in the middle of the side fo' then I spit another flow 
 And when I hit the West I blow sesh everyday 
 Get up with Firski or (E) 40 when I'm in Frisco or the Bay 
 And when I'm in L.A. I get up with Snoop and The Game 
 And a lot full of six-fo's red and blue all on them thangs 
 And when I'm in the Chi it's Crucial or Do Or Die 
 Come and walk with the guy take a journey, just you and I 
 They ask me to shake it for 'em so they can take a glance 
 It's get money game, Mobb, 'cause gangstas don't dance 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why, this is why 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why, this is why 
 This is why I'm cold 
 I'm cold 'cause I'm hot 
 You ain't 'cause you not 
 This is why, this is why 
 This is why I'm cold 
 I'm cold 'cause I'm hot 
 You ain't 'cause you not 
 This is why, this is why 
 This is why I'm cold 
 (Verse 2: Speedknot Mobstaz) 
 This is why I'm hot, got feens on my block 
 Plus you know your boy is first name basis with the cops 
 Rollin' twenty-eight's, known for whippin' cakes 
 Tryna make a million plus off these Great Lakes 
 They say we're the gang of niggas always getting money 
 And dare one of you bitch niggas to try to take it from me 
 This is why I'm cold I'm always in the gold 
 Sportin chunky ice when the wind is ten below 
 Always blowin' kush with some good dope to push 
 'Cause I'm makin' dirty money like that nigga George Bush 
 Outside it be freezin' the season is the winter 
 But I don't give a fuck I'm out here hustlin' in December 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why, this is why 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why, this is why 
 This is why I'm cold 
 I'm cold 'cause I'm hot 
 You ain't 'cause you not 
 This is why, this is why 
 This is why I'm cold 
 I'm cold 'cause I'm hot 
 You ain't 'cause you not 
 This is why, this is why 
 This is why I'm cold 
 (Verse 3: Speedknot Mobstaz) 
 This is why I'm cold, give me some kush dro 
 Niggas love sto', 'cause I keep it for the low 
 Grams like eight balls I'm always on call 
 I got a little er'thang I won't stop shall I fall 
 Keep a P95 in my 76 L.I. 
 Throw the folds to the sky, nigga this is why I'm fly 
 Let the minks sweep the flo', it's cold as Chicago 
 Ground full of snow, table full of snow 
 Been feenin' for some money since Jackson Bo had blows 
 Been feenin' for some money since Don Juan had hoes 
 My neck stay icy, niggas wanna fight me 
 Haters talk shit 'cause they know they bitches like me 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why, this is why 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why I'm cold 
 This is why, this is why 
 This is why I'm cold 
 I'm cold 'cause I'm hot 
 You ain't 'cause you not 
 This is why, this is why 
 This is why I'm cold 
 I'm cold 'cause I'm hot 
 You ain't 'cause you not 
 This is why, this is why 
 This is why I'm cold
