Now when I touch on yo body, babe 
 (Touch on yo body) 
 And when I grab on yo body, babe 
 (When I grab on yo body, babe) 
 When I feel on yo body, babe 
 (When I feel on yo body, babe) 
 I say 
 (Ooh) 
 Hell, yeah 
 Can I reintroduce myself for the city of the chi 
 West side ain't it mayne, put some flame to the Maryjane 
 Down with the same thang, with main in the left lane 
 Peep game, put the duck in the ash tray, got on the freeway 
 Sprayed a lil' cologne on the car seats 
 Then I gotta up with big d and six freaks 
 They was thick as hell, you understand me? 
 I was sippin' on patron about to fade out 
 Got up with lil' ma, had the whole lick laid out 
 Put the Gucci on the door seat, countin' some mo gee's 
 The dice game, damn near, broke me 
 So I'm callin' fo' mo' gees's 
 And puttin' a pound of weed and four b's 
 My thumper and my door keys, walked up like she know me 
 I gotta keep it movin' 'cause she prolly be the police 
 So I got turned tough told her to meet me in the Range Rove 
 We ain't getting' money so I gotta go and change clothes 
 Bumped out with the same hoes, tonight we in the hotel 
 'Cause I got it in the main floor, all them lookin' good 
 But I wanna hit the main fo' what you think I'm spittin' game for? 
 'Cause I talk a lotta spots Andale, Andale, Andale, cha, cha 
 I gotta beg for yo body, girl, I need yo body 
 I see you with my body every time I see yo body 
 I say ooh, ooh, if you was a car, girl, you'd be a phantom 
 Yo ass and yo titties, ain't no tellin' if I had them what I'd do 
 (Ooh) 
 I was chose in this game to be a cold mothafucka 
 With the fe's and the lad's, now let the roof all down 
 While I'm getting' good ol' head, smoke the trees in the back 
 You see the mix with the jewels and the stacks 
 Don't try to pull it, I got goons with the gaps 
 My money long like a python, makes yo bitch say, fuck it 
 I'm a roll with the Mack, B-low getting' all that dough 
 B-low gon' pimp them hoes, B-low getting' all that show 
 And my meat gon' touch the floor, mothafucka, get on? 
 Spit row like I said you already know, P-O-P-I-M-P 
 I gotta beg for yo body, girl, I need yo body 
 I see you with my body every time I see yo body 
 I say ooh, ooh, if you was a car, girl, you'd be a phantom 
 Yo ass and yo titties, ain't no tellin' if I had them what I'd do 
 (Ooh) 
 Girl, you got a bangin' body like a Bugatti 
 She got work like a cookin' pot 
 (Oh) 
 She got legs like a potential hit 
 (Yes) 
 And a frame like a workin' car 
 But who the one the women lookin' spectacular fo'? 
 Who the one that got the bump in the back of the truck? 
 Who the one that saw the body with the booty of a Maserati 
 While I'm in the party way back in the club 
 You be kinda remindin' me of my gee princess 
 So I gotta say majesty when I say that 
 And when I see the way the fatty lookin' from way back 
 You be kinda remindin' me of a Maybach 
 You be the type I know I might kiss 
 And if I flow it right I know I'm so righteous 
 And if you wanna try and get as lyrical like The Twist 
 You gotta flow like this 
 So now I'm a go to the back, get a cup fill it up 
 With the drank when I mack on a hoe 
 Triple it up 'cause when I get out I wanna cut 
 'Cause I'm twist and I'm a kick that spectacular flow 
 Now I spit you with the kind of glory 
 Know it's kinda gory when I come out of the laboratory, let's ride 
 Ain't no fuckin' with the Twista, JP 
 Do or die, you are now with the category f5 
 I gotta beg for yo body, girl, I need yo body 
 I see you with my body every time I see yo body 
 I say ooh, ooh, if you was a car, girl, you'd be a phantom 
 Yo ass and yo titties, ain't no tellin' if I had them what I'd do 
 (Ooh) 
 Now when I touch on yo body, babe 
 (Touch on yo body) 
 And when I grab on yo body, babe 
 (When I grab on yo body, babe) 
 When I feel on yo body, babe 
 (When I feel on yo body, babe) 
 I say 
 (Ooh) 
 Hell, yeah
