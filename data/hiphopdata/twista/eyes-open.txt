(Keep those) Eyes open, gotta keep 'em open 
 Need a higher dose 
 Just something just a little more potent 
 My eyes open, gotta keep 'em open 
 Need a higher dose 
 Just something just a little more potent 
 On the gas, saved up the bat, can't forget where I came from 
 Same mistakes, that's madness, you end up back in those same slums 
 Day one, my eyes was on that prize that I sized up 
 Now I supposed to check, I supposed to check, I found that for the white fuck 
 Cold care, beauty pies, steaming all the way that jury lane 
 Bad fuck behind that mask, bitch might have that booty face 
 I earned this and I be down, before they told you I be there 
 I let you in, you bit the hand, nigga that's downright treason 
 My eyes out for that mischief, fuck that, fill clips 
 To the top, real rap, know that I just build this 
 Sweat, blood and tears, my brother died was the only time I shed tears 
 Then switched gears, pulled out of here like last year 
 Now everything gets smoothed, like jasmine, chinchilla 
 Puff so white, that's Mac Miller, for some kind of wait then blast, nigga 
 Worry me that's the good one, fear nothing, add 'em 
 'Round here ain't no fab one, we knocks it without no flare gun 
 I stay down, I'm a chaos, havoc and mayhem 
 To be in the streets you gotta be a brave man 
 Talk about you coming up and do the main band 
 'Cause ain't no telling what these motherfuckers would do 
 Be prepared in case anybody fuck with the crew 
 They was in the club, watching, you was in the VIP 
 Throwing hundreds around like money ain't nothing to you 
 They be the ones that fall back, up in the cut and probably in all black 
 Mean motherfuckers and they all strapped, looking you, acting like you was all that 
 Acting like you untouchable 'cause you tripping till they catch you slipping 
 And then what you thought you'd see? 
 Better be on top of your chip when you walking through the shots 
 Same demo when you walk through Queens 
 Shorty like I doubt that, I got things and I'm 'bout that 
 This hood life what it look like, probably snatched up still ain't felt that 
 The game is better, it's cold or vice versa depending on what you see, so 
 Learn when to check your ego, watch your people, money is evil 
 When you learn to keep your 
 Either with me or against me, there ain't no in-betweens 
 Don't walk around fearing no man when they bleed just like me 
 I represent that bad block, I'm mascot, is that real dope? 
 Roam around with that fuckery and get stomped out with them steel toes 
 Mashed up on that sidewalk, can't go against that current 
 Taking turns whipping that ass, we gonna give respect that's earned 
 And to whom it may concern, got a problem, be my guest 
 We will play fair but you will 'cause you're not keeping no death around 
 Keep those
