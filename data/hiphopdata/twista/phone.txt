Twista: 
 Now Twista and Syleena on tour, 
 We can barely see each other, and you told me you ain't like that, 
 But what if I find a way were can still be together and your freaky, would you like that, 
 I know I'm gettin' you warm, I'm about to fuck you all night 
 And hit it until the morning, 
 How I do it, keep you wetter than a mystical storm, 
 Even though I ain't gon' be there in the physical form 
 'Cause I, lick you anywhere you want, freaky nigga from the hood, 
 Doin' you good while I rub you body, 
 Pull yo' hair, to the seat, so that I can get up in you from the back, 
 While I scream ouuh shawty, I could snatch you out that thong, 
 Let's get it on as many times as you want, 
 Now visualize that it's me while you touch yourself, 
 Can you feel me cummin through the phone? 
 Syleena: 
 I'm waiting 
 In the living room 
 Drinking Alize' 
 Ready for you 
 To touch me soft, rub me strong, get me wet, love me long 
 But wait a minute 
 I need you to (Take all your clothes off) 
 I want you to (Come in here and set it off) 
 From the floor to the bed 
 Baby tell me are feeling me yet 
 (On this phone sex) Breathing hard while I touch myself 
 (On this phone sex) Gotta do it 'cause I'm by myself 
 (On this phone sex) You're not here but I feel you babe 
 (On this phone sex) And all you gotta do is scream my name 
 (On this phone sex) Getting hotter by the minute babe 
 (On this phone sex) Got me reaching for my "rabbit" babe 
 (On this phone sex) 
 But I'm frontin 'cause I know babe (baby) 
 It ain't nothin' like the real thing 
 Ah 
 Can you see me 
 In a red thong 
 Red pump heals 
 Nothing else on 
 Oil on my legs 
 Cherry red lips 
 Black hair straight 
 Covering my breasts 
 Would you like that? 
 How bout I? (Do a little strip tease) 
 Then you can (Take advantage of me) 
 Anything you want me to be 
 Baby I can be your fantasy 
 (On this phone sex) Breathing hard while I touch myself 
 (On this phone sex) Gotta do it 'cause I'm by myself 
 (On this phone sex) You're not here but I feel you babe 
 (On this phone sex) And all you gotta do is scream my name 
 (On this phone sex) Getting hotter by the minute babe 
 (On this phone sex) Got me reaching for my "rabbit" babe 
 (On this phone sex) 
 But I'm frontin 'cause I know babe (baby) 
 It ain't nothin' like the real thing 
 Imagine me on the top of the bed 
 On my hands and knees- saying 
 "Come here daddy, come on and get in" 
 Talk dirty to me 
 Tell me how it feels 
 Fast or slow baby 
 Tell me what you wanna do to me 
 Ooh, you feel so good 
 Keep it right there 
 I'm about to climax 
 On this phone sex
