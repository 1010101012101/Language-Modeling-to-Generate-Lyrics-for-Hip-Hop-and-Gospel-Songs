Yo Fiend, what up man? (Yo, yo) 
 You rollin' with these Legit Ballaz right? (Whomp) 
 Aight, well check it out 
 Won't you tell these muthafuckaz a lil' bit about where you come from 
 (Fiend) 
 Fire arms, sounds of alarms 
 Consistency in bodily harm 
 Where I'm from that's the norm 
 Fiend the? 
 Lil' nigga ain't no man of creaton 
 Once we encounter the killin' spree we on 
 My defects have G's bet on 
 Niggaz dollars get they rep on 
 Speakin' with heat ? could bring death on 
 Nigga I'm called the killa 
 Cause every time he get it, it brought chills 
 Lead that's what made 'em take his ass for real 
 I done ? survivor 
 He never wrote the name of his drivers 
 And wondered that the man can deprive ya 
 It's there in black ink 
 With millions in dirty green had to think 
 Lives depreciated over drinks 
 Call me twisted 
 Rope burns to the neck was insisted 
 And all his hope turned to "I guess should I risk it?" 
 (Fiend talkin') 
 And that's why the law is laid down 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 From Fiend to N.O. to Chi, Twista 
 Pimp run it now 
 (Hook - Fiend (Oobie)) 
 Now to my hustlaz slangin' cain 
 I said some survive the game 
 Some just get they names in the stories to be told 
 Why the young never make it old 
 Now to my hustlaz slangin' cain 
 I said some survive the game 
 Some just get they names in the stories to be told 
 Why the young never make it old (Why the young never make it old) 
 (Liffy Stokes) 
 I live my life drownin' in homicide 
 Never let the drama slide 
 We killaz quick to let it ride 
 Send a nigga beddy-by when I let it fly 
 Nigga
