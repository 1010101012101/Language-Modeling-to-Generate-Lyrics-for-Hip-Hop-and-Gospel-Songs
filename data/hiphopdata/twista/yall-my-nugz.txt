(Twista) 
 Yes yes y'all 
 It's the Twista in the house 
 Over another trax production 
 Normally I would kick somethin' about the ladies 
 But I'm gonna kick somethin' to my niggas 
 'Cause we roll B's together stack cheese together 
 (Twista) 
 All afternoon them shorties workin the tip causin havoc on the spot 
 Bringin' much static on the block 
 Half sacks 'cause money makin' is the magic of them rocks 
 Try to make 'em uncock the glock but the weapon is protection shit 
 You know they hurtin' in my section 
 Yet a hustle gets depressing laws on the streets holla at the chief 
 And still can't get a blessing 
 They smokin' wicked in the hood 
 Plus the people is gettin' blowed itching to come at ya stash 
 Run up with the strap so fast 
 You gone they be already gone 'cause they coming at ya ass 
 Trippin' when the pistol tap ya glass 
 And when they get drama they gotta call up some holsta's 
 But you know my homies quicker on the chrome 
 And if it's on it's on then my mobsta's go nuts 
 To the rhythm of a slow cut 
 Let me ask you a question "Is it safe where you got your sacks?" 
 It's only one got two packs a case of static in the streets them niggas got ya 
 Back 
 Some real ass homies you can roll with 
 So when the phony ones come at you they be ready for the thuggin' 
 Slug huggin heat 'em up like an oven hang tight everynight 
 Drinkin' down 'cause a cousins 
 'Cause y'all roll up with me every time it's on 
 'Cause its straight shady niggas around my hood 
 Bless me with the sess so we can trip off on what I'm smokin' on 
 'Cause y'all my nugz 
 Roll with each other till the day we die 
 Rather shakin up work handing out tips ain't no lie 
 Be quick to get stunged the gun trying to take all of our goods 
 'Cause y'all my nugz 
 Y'all roll up with me every time it's on 
 'Cause these straight shady niggas around my hood 
 Bless me with the sess so we can trip off on what I'm smokin' on 
 'Cause y'all my nugz 
 Roll with each other till the day we die 
 Rather shakin up work handing out tips ain't no lie 
 Be quick to get stunged the gun trying to take all of our goods 
 'Cause y'all my nugz 
 (Twista) 
 I juss wanted to take some time out to say thanks to the nugz 
 Hit the dank 'cause it's good 
 And when it come thank help me from saving me from gettin' ganked in the hood 
 Anythang for y'all 
 I know there's times where it be hurting where one of hit the lick us breakin 
 Some B's 
 Got the ace of spades breakin them trees for my psychotic stanky bitches 
 Acting janky if we making some cheese 
 'Cause we ride stick petty and smoke shit 
 Find a lame to toke with 
 We ain't never quick to come up on now yet run up on whether she wanna go home 
 And roam 
 We smokin' top down till the summer gone 
 Rollin' up swishers and gunnin on 
 Straight up chillin' with my homies go hit the liquor store 
 We gotta swishes get some mo 
 Saving 'em so we can blaze 'em and kick it where the thick hoes go 
 My homies is the reason fo 
 It took me some time but I gotta show my nugz I ain't no hoe 
 They can depend on me if someone's fist throwin' knuckles and sticks 
 Plus I'll go get the fo fo 
 You already know Joe 'cause if we fall while we runnin' from the po-po Ima pick you 
 Up 
 Need some hoes Ima get you sucked 
 And try my best not to never let a mothafucka stick you up 
 Ima ride and I know you niggas know that 
 Cut the enemy no slack for ya lame as a jumpsport 
 Flaming philosify till the brush short breakin up the hunnies on the wall on 
 The front porch 
 And I love the ladies but you be killin' me some time gettin' mobsta ain't tight 
 Now put a hoe before a homies that'll rob from your dawg I'm yellin' out mobstas 
 Fo life 
 (Twista) 
 Baby I see ya thick but this time fuck a bitch 
 Ima take my boy to pick out a fit 
 Betta yet I run game like E-40 in a click end up having you lick on this dick 
 Bump and size I pleasure neva coulda I eva be happy knowing 
 That my homies wasn't on they feet strong 
 I ain't stackin that many g's but hit ya motha some cheese if I have to help to 
 Keep the heat on 
 I be down like that you know the lead 
 Reminicsing on clubs and swingin' when you got moved on the Amaredo got you gone 
 And he's with her before I got you home 
 But we have came a long way since then 
 All for one one for all till I pass on the plastic 
 You show me love that last and not the plastic bags together separated by the 
 Casket
