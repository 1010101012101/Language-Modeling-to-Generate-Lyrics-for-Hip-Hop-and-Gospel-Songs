Intro (Twista) 
 Kells and Twist 
 Girl there ain't no other way to describe you 
 Your Momma raised you right 
 Yeah I like that 
 Chorus (R. Kelly) 
 It's like I'm sitting here in my rehab 
 I'm so crazy about you dear 
 Doctor of my soul 
 I won't never check out of here 
 Filled my prescription when I came to you and needed peace 
 You took me in and gave me joy and girl now I'm free 
 You in my circle when I needed to talk you had my back 
 You're my homey we go back thank you for that love rehab 
 Verse 1 (Twista) 
 You were back had nobody in my life 
 I'm a killer nigga or somebody gonna murder me soon 
 I'm a hope fiend I need a woman in my life 
 Could you take me to the emergency room 
 I need somebody that can nurse me back to health 
 'Cause I'm out here love sick shaking like Hoopdy 
 You took me up out of the Hoopdy 
 Put me in the Lex 300 that got me blowing on goopdy 
 Now why do I respect you 
 'Cause she down for a nigga before I was on the city in the city now she got me screaming out yes sir 
 Like a Pretty Ricky looking freaky, freaky while I'm smoking on the sticky hickey 
 When I'm down and I 
 You be rubbing my back because I miss you 
 You know I got issues 
 When I'm riding dirty and I got the thumper 
 And law pull me over you hold my pistol 
 Sick of how the women holding me 
 Telling me if I'm a see love by the way I want to hit you 
 You like it better when I'm not in cements because you better than Excedrin 
 Fellas in the hood ain't gonna get you 
 Hook (Twista) 
 I thought I knew what real love was tell I met you 
 I'm reminiscing on the love we had 
 I'm a stay sick for ever hope I never get well cause you got me in a love rehab 
 Verse 2 (R. Kelly) 
 So many problems so many peoples 
 So many decisions so many roads 
 That I have to choose 
 But still I roll the dice and pray that I don't lose 
 There where times I got weak and surely couldn't go on 
 And she came through 
 So many friends so many liars 
 And so many haters 
 Sometimes I just don't know who to trust 
 But yet still I turn the wheel of life and try my luck 
 There was a time when I was broke and didn't have a job 
 And this woman she showed me love 
 Since we first met I've been rising like an escalator 
 Now five years later We've come up like an elevator 
 You make me better babe 
 When I thought I was going crazy 
 I was just about to lose my mind 
 And you put me in your love rehab 
 Verse 3 (Twista) 
 I'm a spit that love flow 
 Forget what they all say 
 She the only one that help me 
 Hit her with a little bit of twelve play 
 When Twista wasn't poppin' I can remember telling the love doctor that I need some help 
 Nigga fire like I'm shocking I love to cock a pistol and I feel like I'm bleeding to death 
 My surgeon and my Methodist were the only ones I talked to 
 When I was left alone 
 You're the one that helped me fight through my challenges 
 Tell me what's my psychoanalysis 
 Exit (Twista) 
 Kells and Twist 
 Gotta let her know she's that's the only reason we make it through sometimes 
 That's why we sitting here in my rehab
