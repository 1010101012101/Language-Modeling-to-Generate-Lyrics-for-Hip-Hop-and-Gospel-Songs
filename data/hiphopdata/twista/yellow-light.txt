Hey, hey, hey, hey, uh, uh, huh, uh, uh, uh 
 Aye, ay, ay, ay, ay, hey, hey hey, hey 
 Hey, hey, sometimes I go fast, sometimes I just stop 
 Sometimes I take it slow when I let the sex drop 
 But most of the time I go quick 
 When I'm hittin' that shit and she like it, she like it 
 But tonight she said she didn't want to go too fast 
 And tonight she said she want me to take my time 
 So I took her down and said, do you like that 
 And she said, hell, yeah 
 Then hit medium from the back 
 I said, it's cool and she said, hell, yeah 
 She said, ooh baby, just take control, baby 
 As long as you take it slow, baby 
 Then you can hit all night, baby 
 She gave me the green so I have to go 
 Start screamin' my name when I went low 
 And every time I start goin' fast 
 She look at me and said 
 Yellow light, yellow light, yellow light, yellow light 
 Gotta slow it down 
 Yellow light, yellow light, yellow light, yellow light 
 Gotta slow it down 
 I told her that wanted to beat it up fast 
 So lil' mama let me know when to go 
 Tonight she don't want a drill session 
 She wanna feel it, so she told me to take it slow 
 I'm so use to mackin', pokin' to back to back 
 When I'm attackin' it I wanna go get in 
 She blew the whistle like, be still 
 Hold it in now, roll it in 
 She lift up her palms to hold my face 
 Because she want me to control my pace 
 She said she wanna feel it all 
 Side through the windows of the wall 
 'Cause the feelin' was too cold away 
 Well, I can break it down to 50 
 Down to 40 down to 30 
 In the speed you want me to, I can do for you 
 Shawty, tell me how you want it 
 Do you want the Lambo? 
 I give it to like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh 
 When I do it, baby, or do you want the 64? 
 I give it to you like, uh, uh 
 When I give it to you, baby 
 Now I was thinkin', I was all up in it right 
 But now she got me caught up at the light 
 I try da call it like 
 Green uh, uh, too fast, red, uh, uh, too slow 
 She wanted in the middle so gotta 
 Yellow light, yellow light, yellow light, yellow light 
 Gotta slow it down 
 Yellow light, yellow light, yellow light, yellow light 
 Gotta slow it down 
 Now wid a subtle way to sooth yo' soul 
 Gotta lovin' the way I move the pole 
 Instead of rude and bold I wanna see what it feel like 
 When playa break it down into cruise control 
 And still rule the role 
 Never stuckin' on a one speed dick shift in a stick shift 
 I am not them dudes 
 Is not a jack rabbit when I be tappin' it 
 I wanna slow it up and give it to her chopped and screwed 
 Come here shawty and lemme knock them shoes 
 Feel it sensual when I rock to the groove makin' hot thang cool 
 If you think you butter, show us how to stutter, step, stop then move 
 But I get not the order 
 Narry canary and my flow is like a shoppahorra 
 Scaryin' Barry whenever I rock with the R Kelly 
 In every position for power we slaughter 
 In petty like veli, I'm getting' money 'cause I oughta 
 I tell the girl to slow down lil' mama 
 'Cause you ain't gotta be so anxious 
 Go on rapidly when you flex yo' thighs 
 'Cause still good sex if you exercise yo' patients 
 We ain't gotta do it like we racin' 
 'Cause all the time that ain't how I like it 
 Green, uh, uh, too fast, red, uh, uh, too slow 
 I'm on the mid level so she gotta 
 Yellow light, yellow light, yellow light, yellow light 
 Gotta slow it down 
 Yellow light, yellow light, yellow light, yellow light 
 Gotta slow it down
