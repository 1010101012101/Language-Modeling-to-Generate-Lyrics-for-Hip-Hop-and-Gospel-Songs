(Diddy) 
 Hey yo Twista, it's about that motha fuckin' time again. 
 Time to let these niggas know, 
 The originator, never to be duplicated. 
 King of that machine gun spit shit. 
 Hey yo Twista, blow a motha fuckas brains out. 
 (Twista) 
 I'm about to take everybody back to the basics 
 I'm historical an oracle event is about to occur 
 Because a mother fucker put these raps in the matrix 
 And I'm a terror when I spit it on tracks full of hatred 
 But it's beauty in the dark 
 Just put it into your mouth and the flow is mmm 
 Like that when you taste it 
 Come at niggas like a disciple of death 
 You would think I'm poppin' a rifle or tech 
 I'm aimin right for the neck 
 Your momma might as well call up the funeral home 
 So she can write 'em a check 
 A vile of dialect 
 That's why they feelin' me a trilogy 
 A horror is what I become 
 So they call me Jason Vorhee 
 Oops I mean chasin more cheese 
 Niggas gotta pay some more fees 
 Hot enough to break a thermometer from another planet 
 I kill 'em from here to Andromeda 
 A comet will hit the planet when I'm in the middle 
 While rappers swallow you a diabolical astonisher 
 Astronomer because I'm outta the Galaxy 
 Challenge me I will disintegrate your body like a particle 
 Follow you into a corridor at four in the morning 
 So I can horrify you right before I slaughter you 
 My boys sayin' they don't think I'm comin' with it 
 So you know a nigga gotta get 'em all 
 Then I'mma be 
 Murderin them like a serial killer 
 Then I'mma hide 'em in the ceiling and the wall 
 Fuck 'em all! 
 Niggas will never get next to this 
 I rock a rollie so I flex the wrist 
 I'mma blow up and sit in your place 
 And throw up shit in your face 
 Like the exorcist 
 You can't mess with this. 
 Now let's take shit back to the basics 
 How we used to do shit 
 With the original sound 
 But still somehow comin' with that new shit 
 Talk about the way it ain't no morals or respect in the streets no more 
 Don't pause with the heat no more 
 'Cause there really ain't nothing out here to eat no more 
 Nowadays niggas acting like they lovin' the dime 
 Used to be some respect 
 But now they just kill and stack em 
 Cause Benjamin Franklin a governor now 
 Theoretically you better be ahead of everybody 
 Around you 'cause a nigga might fuck you 
 Don't need to be nothing but killers in your family that always surround you 
 Cause a nigga might touch you 
 Since the recession it been hard on the streets 
 So a nigga comin' hard on the beats 
 No order in the hood 
 I remember when niggas would get into it 
 They gone have to take problems to chief 
 Now they don't give a fuck who they be shootin 
 Or who they be robbin or what you ride 
 All they really care bout is who got that 
 And if you let one of these knucklehead bitches 
 Know you're sitting on something 
 Mothafuckas is gonna be at that 
 South side murderer 
 It's the west side killer 
 Up north and over east is a beast 
 What they release 
 Be leavin' you deceased 
 Fuck up anybody that try to do damage 
 The block is the planet 
 And shawty's is too buck for it to be peace 
 So I carry a piece 
 But I don't wanna shoot it 
 'Cause I already wanna see some of my niggas locked up in jail home 
 Instead of hollerin at 'em on a cell phone 
 R.I.P. 'cause my little brother Rell gone 
 Got to show a different way to get it 
 Instead of bein on the attack full of hatred 
 Or get smacked in the face with 
 The reality of death if we don't get back to the basics 
 Now let's take shit back to the basics 
 How we used to do shit 
 With the original sound 
 But still somehow comin' with that new shit 
 Talk about the way it ain't no morals or respect in the streets no more 
 Don't pause with the heat no more 
 'Cause there really ain't nothing out here to eat no more
