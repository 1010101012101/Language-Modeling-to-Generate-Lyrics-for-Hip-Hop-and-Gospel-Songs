Me and my closest road dog 
 Came up in an early age on the corner servin' cane 
 Gang bangin' and everythang 
 We some mutherfuckin gangstas 
 Broke to the right 
 Blood in Blood out brothers and we swore that was for life 
 Servin' them keys and be clocking them g's and 
 We got whatever you need just a come and see me 
 Or my mutherfucking nug bout to show this city up show love 
 Or catch that bug from that nine millimeter slug 
 I broke bread with this nigga, I bust lead with this nigga 
 Heard he fucking with the feds 
 Can't believe it, not my nigga 
 Selling me for the cash, was he moving too fast 
 Talking behing my back to them damn hood rats 
 I'm going crazy ain't that a bitch 
 You try and get bitched and your closest rodey 
 Turns into a snitch 
 Just smiling and laughing in your fucking face 
 Went behind your fucking back hooking you with a fucking case 
 Going insane and I don't know what to think 
 Paranoid out my mind as I take another drink 
 Of that hennessy motherfuckin cognac 
 Got me reaching for my nine 
 Bout to peel this niggas cap 
 So I walked out the house 
 And I headed for the corner 
 I seen that nigga creeped up on him 
 Bitch yous a goner 
 Up that itchy to his temple why'd you try to fuck me Rodey 
 Started crying C-M-B 
 Nigga this ain't to New Jack City 
 And my name ain't no mutherfuckin Nino Brown 
 A tear roll down my cheek and I blew his brains on the ground 
 Sirens all around lights all in my face 
 Dick boys on the case so I headed towards the gate 
 Bitch freeze 
 Bitch please 
 That's what I told them punk ass cops 
 All of a sudden I heard the shot 
 Couldn't believe I just got popped 
 Didn't drop, turned around, grapped my nine, then I pulled it 
 Started yelling just like fates a_?Bitch I took your fucking 
 Bulleta_? 
 Everything turned cold and got dark 
 I couldn't feel nathan but the beating of my heart 
 Blood in blood out 
 I thought that we was family 
 Can't believe he crossed me 
 Got to break him off G 
 Am I my brothers keeper 
 I thought that was for life 
 It's gonna be a murder this nigga gots ta die
