No muggy manny man gonna feel this shit here tramp 
 Try out the (?) bobby land rasta man one land one land live one land love 
 You come you come you test the rasta 
 You come you come you test the rasta 
 You test Bennie and I told ya motherfucker boom 
 Now ya fucking dead 
 (Bennie Franks) 
 I drop bombs like who say mad ass 
 Verbal ammunition when I solve a blast ass I stash cash 
 Assassination like Ras Kass 
 Bitches and 10 hut 
 I'ma money making soldier 'cause I don't give no fuck 
 The world is mine 
 You stepping over gages grenades and land mines so hand mine 
 If you was around nigga you probably ban mine 
 Off the loado watching out for the rorrow popping at the po po 
 99 brinks truck candy apple sitting on normols 
 Them niggas don't wanna see us come up 
 So fuck them marks for the legit ballers for the world blow up 
 Its ain't no sold off shit I'm still top of the mess 
 Check Tom disrespect Tom teflon through his chest 
 And fuck 'em for T 
 I'm rolling in my candle camouflage 
 Wing ding and white wands and now I ready to march 
 Embark on this who trying to whip the lyrical arsonist 
 Look learn and listen my baguette still glisten 
 My nine shines its 6 past 6 so bitches prime time 
 Who in they write mine nigga trying to define rhyme 
 L-E-G-I-T ballers 
 Give it up for them pistol pistol the knuckle street baller 
 Come on 
 B-E double N I-E Franks 
 B-E double N I-E Franks 
 B-E double N I-E Franks 
 B-E double N I-E Franks 
 It's a joint we completed niggas ballers boy 
 That's the money making soldiers bringing all the noise 
 Ain't nothing on ya block but them vocaling toys 
 Riding tinted out real straps
