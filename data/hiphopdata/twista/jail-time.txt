 Hello 
 (Turtle Banxx) 
 Hey sis let me speak to momma 
 Who me on find besides all the drama 
 The system took me in but then they took me under 
 I suffer being another number 
 I wonder if I could conquer dis criminal structure built to puncture 
 The hearts of men 
 When them guards come in the bars and the pen 
 I know I'm in hell and its hard to win 
 I stay up late lying in the dark for me 
 Thinking 'bout the night the police came marching in 
 It's like they wouldn't stop barging in 
 Asking momma what mob I'm in 
 Try strictly left us some scars within 
 Fighting back the lyrics of a favorite baptist him 
 It's over now can't hold a child 
 Mold a child scold a child or own a child a soldier now 
 Baby hold your tears 
 Become a teacher mold ya peers 
 Let 'em know its cold in here 
 This ain't the way to spend them older years 
 I'm over the fears of the world 
 No longer momma's pearl in here 
 It's all clear them older cats school me to the game 
 I'm all ears no mo rats or any cold beers 
 The ghetto famous disappear 
 They run up in my home 
 And took you from my world 
 Now ya gone and I'm feeling all the pain that your going through 
 (Chorus 1 in background of chorus 2) 
 Sometimes I lay back in my cell crying 
 Hells blind but I hope I make it through this jail time 
 Trying to stay focus but I heard they mad me panic before 
 I guess that's what I got my family for behind bars 
 (Turtle Banxx) 
 I'm running outta time 
 Momma there yet 
 Where my little brother let me holla at him 
 What's up cat 
 I got you covered 
 Stay in the books them streets is a motha 
 Undercovers posing as hustlers exposing the brothers controlling the 
 Struggle by any means 
 Brutality got the police running like the enemy 
 Our community need more hugs instead of the slugs the guns the drugs 
 Got crime on killing the love the spirits above 
 Drop a warning sigh its only 1999 
 But all I think about is 85 them good times 
 Momma give us her last dime 
 Icey cups you drop yours I give you mine 
 True love define us to divine 
 Calling it on another's pride but I hate to see you cry 
 The rain come shine 
 My family feel my pain inside 
 By the way my baby momma getting married 
 Brought tears to my eyes I just hope my son happy 
 (Chorus 1 in background of chorus 2) 
 (Turtle Banxx) 
 Ran to the phone got a hundred guys like me 
 And all we have is precious minutes to reach our people our free 
 Brother listen be strong for momma 
 Let her know I never meant to cause her no drama 
 The pain make my vain cries thunder 
 Will I recover my name and still discover how the game become us 
 Look how they done us 
 Watered down our pride and drunkers riders g's and hustlers 
 We gotta guide our younger there's better days among us 
 Never let the rage you under upstage the promise till tomorrow 
 And the C's just follow wont feel the sorrow 
 For the misery we wallowing time swallowing 
 Them better days in this gaze got my mind boggling 
 Oh momma and hey lady I miss you 
 And them ways you raised me them hard head things that drove you crazy 
 Realize ya son took a lot of heart from ya 
 Its phone check time I'm gone momma I love you 
 (Chorus 1 in background of chorus 2)
