*R.Kelly* 
 Now usually I don't do this but, ah, go ahead 
 And break 'em off with a lil preview of the remix 
 Now I'm not tryin' to be rude 
 But hey pretty girl I'm feelin' you 
 The way you do the things you do 
 Reminds me of my Lexus coup 
 That's why I'm all up in yo grill 
 Tryin'a get you to a hotel 
 You must be a football coach 
 The way you got me playin' the field 
 So baby gimme that toot toot 
 And lemme give you that beep beep 
 Runnin' her hands through my 'fro 
 Bouncin' on 24's 
 While they say on the radio... 
 It's the remix to ignition 
 Hot and fresh out the kitchen 
 Mama rollin' that body 
 Got every man in here wishin' 
 Sippin' on coke and rum 
 I'm like, so what I'm drunk 
 It's the freakin' weekend baby 
 I'm about to have me some fun 
 Bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce 
 Bounce-bounce-bounce 
 Now it's like 'Murder She Wrote' 
 Once I get you out them clothes 
 Privacy is on the door 
 Still they can hear you screamin' more 
 Girl I'm feelin' what you feelin' 
 No more hopin' and wishin' 
 I'm bout to take my key and 
 Stick it in the ignition 
 So gimme that toot toot 
 Lemme give you that beep beep 
 Runnin' her hands through my 'fro 
 Bouncin' on 24's 
 While they say on the radio... 
 This is the remix to 'Ignition' 
 Hot and fresh out the kitchen 
 Mama rollin' that body 
 Got every man in here wishin' 
 Sippin' on coke and rum 
 I'm like so what I'm drunk 
 It's the freakin' weekend baby 
 I'm about to have me some fun 
 Crystall poppin' in the stretch Navigator 
 We got food everywhere 
 As if the party was catored 
 We got fellas to my left 
 Honeys on my right 
 We bring 'em both together we got drinkin' all night 
 Then after the show it's the (after party) 
 And after the party it's the (hotel lobby) 
 And 'round about 4 you gotta (clear the lobby) 
 Then head take it to the room and somebody 
 Can I get a toot toot 
 Can I get a beep beep 
 Runnin' her hands through my 'fro 
 Bouncin' on 24's 
 While they say on the radio... 
 It's the remix to 'Ignition' 
 Hot and fresh out the kitchen 
 Mama rollin' that body 
 Got every man in here wishin' 
 Sippin' on coke and rum 
 I'm like so what I'm drunk 
 It's the freakin' weekend baby 
 I'm about to have me some fun 
 Bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce-bounce 
 Bounce-bounce-bounce

 Bad boys des check it out, 
 Now let me get you hot as the paint on my porshe uh, 
 Lemme come and ride you I herd you a runna. 
 Baby got them curves just like a Corvette with a big ol' 
 Booty like you was a Humma, heard you wanna take it up 
 Wit a balla thinkin' while you rollin' up wit the Twista, 
 Gettin' you from the back and ride you like a Cadillac got you cruisin' 
 While I'm bangin' your sound system, now lemme get a toot-toot 
 And let me hit you with a beep-beep, runnin' her hands on my fade 
 Bouncin' on the 24's wit the spinnin' blades, wit the ladies goin' 
 Toot-toot and the fellas goin' beep-beep and we got the windows up talkin' 
 Big drow while we rollin' on the Jordans wit the 24's while we rollin' 
 GC Ash got them lyrics twistin'. 
 It's the remix to ignition 
 Hot and fresh out the kitchen 
 Mama rollin' that body

 In the back of my truck

 Stroke it round and round
