Twista been comin' with fast lyrics for year, 
 I'm glad to see niggas catch up to speed 
 But when I come to doin' a intricate pattern I bet you 
 Y'all can never fuck with me (no way) 
 'Cause when it come to this music, 
 I am a Mobsta', I am a chief 
 And when it come to this rap shit 
 Then I am a monster, I am a beast 
 Never let negative energy interfere with this 
 I be from the Outer Limits and I devour to men to haters 
 That intend to annihilate what I put together 
 They don't want to do what I got out from a military 
 And they want to push and then fire my lyricist 
 I would murder 'em with the dialect of an apostle 
 I'm apocalyptic and I can kick it whichever way you wanna hear it 
 Ain't no tellin' who I'ma kill and bury 
 How can you fuck with a nigga willin' to kill 'em all 
 With the ability to body and brigade a motherfuckers that come 
 With the ruckus screw who any that's out of me 
 Whoever strategy you will try to initiate 
 Theoretically I'm decipher that's infinite 
 In other words I'm a molto I came through with polo 
 And one day I'ma go back and tell'em how them niggas 
 That hate on me 'cause I kept a circle and no will not affiliate 
 Ain't no impossible nigga I go the whole yard 
 Ain't no law with my continuum my minimum is forever 
 And ever nigga so whatever you wanna do it 
 Don't really matter to me lets handle it right now 
 What happen to goin' and pullin' nigga hoe card 
 Fuck all the thuggin' on the internet 
 'Cause I'm not into that I'm on a higher intellect 
 And I don't wanna catch a murder 'cause I know 
 That it's possible that you might die 
 Now they be tellin' me Twista come with the hard shit 
 I don't wanna disappoint 'em so I gotta get it in 
 And kill 'em with every syllable after syllable 
 Like a gorilla do when I beat 'em at a physical 
 I be knowin' the way I spit it be God's gift 
 'Cause I'm feelin' so fab, when I fuck a nigga up, 
 And send immaculate conception of something 
 And more than one the proportion of the distortion is biblical 
 Like Isaiah Deuteronomy and Leviticus 
 I be a lyrical prophet I'm a disciple with a rifle 
 When like John the Baptist, 
 My raps is a revelation of the genesis of ya down fall 
 I'm a playa you should follow me 'cause I'm infamous 
 And my flow is off the chain, I be rappin' about something holy 
 Then I talk about your body being cut up in pieces, 
 Out on the premises when they found y'all 
 You gotta give me the status of being a legend 
 In my continuum what I be givin' 'em be killin' 'em in everybody 
 Feelin' 'em I'm colder than December I'm a symbol 
 And I make 'em remember my emblem 
 I hit you with the automatic and see you in heaven 
 Committed a verbal murder we heard the surgery wasn't a success 
 When you was in the hospital so if I ever get charged, 
 I hope that I'ma get the minimum 
 (Repeat: x2) 
 Now there'll be no killing of Twista 'cause I'm omnipotent 
 But most of them niggas just hate on me 'cause I flow different 
 Like the way that I spit it once I get in a niggas ass 
 Intricate patterns of intelligently spoken words, 
 Killin' my enemy off with the dialect the Chicago and I'ma blast
