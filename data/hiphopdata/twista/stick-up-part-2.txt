 Whatcha gon' do when we come for you? 
 It's a stick up 
 Put yo hands up 
 Tell me whatcha gon' do when we come for you? 
 It's a stick up 
 Put yo hands up 
 We came for them, now they comin' for us 
 Whatcha gon' do when yo time is up? 
 We was unprepared for this lickin' plus 
 We been on the run from dawn to dust 
 Wrong nigga, wrong place, wrong car, wrong time 
 Guess I was greedy, shoulda kept the shine 
 But it ain't nowhere to run, nowhere to hide 
 Fuck it, ain't givin' up nigga it's ride or die 
 (Buck) They got us on the run now, in a high-speed chase 
 Holdin' the Feds at gun point with no getaway place 
 (Benn) Nigga look quit bitchin', I ain't even ask for yo help 
 You keep talkin', I'ma burn both of y'all and get away myself 
 (Buck) Man them streets got roadblocks, there's choppers in the ghetto 
 Shinin' them lights on us, and them streets gettin' narrow 
 Nigga the path I chose got exposed by yo ass 
 Either get the ?? plenty ice and more cash 
 (Benn) Nigga shut the fuck up, I got another plan 
 (Buck) Here we go again 
 (Benn) Bust 2 warnin' shots to remind 'em, we still got it man 
 Tell 'em to lose the choppers, and if they don't we pop 'em 
 See all them cars behind 'em, shit I'm itchin' to stop 'em 
 My adrenaline's rushin', these bitches done ?? 
 Robert Taylor raised me, nigga the hood got me scarred 
 (Buck) Damn Bennie, but this that real dilly 
 And we done showed our asses like Mr. Billy 
 Man here they come!

 I'm finna exit on 51st so we can get loose in a buildin'
