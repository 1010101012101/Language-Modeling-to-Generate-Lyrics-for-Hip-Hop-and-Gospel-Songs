 If you wanna come see me for a bag

 If you wanna see that mean green Jag

 If you wanna see me rollin' that Philly

 If you talkin' like you comin' ta get me

 If you wanna see real niggaz around

 Every day I put my life on the line

 Chorus part I 
 +Chorus part II: 
 If you tell me that it ain't really hot

 If you wanna see me out on the block 
 I'm out here 
 If you wanna see that old school Chevy 
 I'm out here 
 If you talkin' like you comin' ta get me 
 I'm out here 
 [Unintelligible] my windows up 
 Hit up my doors then 
 [Blank] my pahtnaz and kidnap all of my hoes then 
 Make my money funny if I got it comin' ta me. 
 Talk stupid to a N** when you run it ta me 
 If you don't want your grill, you don't want to live, you don't want your kids, you don't want your crib. 
 But that's exactly what you're losin', if you don't want it, better let the 'lac hear ya movin'! 
 If you want to hear a real N shine 
 I'm out here 
 Need a pimp to control your body and mind? 
 I'm out here. 
 When you ready to go cook up this cake 
 I'm out here 
 Got a few hundred grams you want to shake? 
 I'm out here. 
 Mobsta Niggas spend that time on the grind 
 Sippin' Yak, slingin packs of the city's biggest dimes, 
 Yeah, you got a decent bag, but yo shit ain't big as mine 
 If you get your game tight, umma have to rob you blind. 
 I'm from K-town, bitch, with different gangs on every block 
 And the way you wear your hat just might get your ass shot 
 The mobsters got the game on lock and the haters full of fear 
 Scared to ride through the hood, 'cause they know we out here. 
 Chorus part I 
 +Chorus part III: 
 When you see me pull that hood up... 
 Better get low! We 'bout to tear the fuckin' 'hood up 
 Ballas and killas and gangstas 
 (What you runnin' from?) 
 Ballas and killas and gangstas 
 (Whatchu runnin' from?) 
 Twista's verse: 
 [Sounds like] Shoulda seen they face when I first [unintelligible] and got it to rock 
 I'm from K-town [blank] and I don't know shit but the block. 
 Gotta get that money so I don't care, 
 I'm posted up right here and I ain't goin' nowhere, you gon' have to move me! 
 Twenty-thousand a week and I ain't hearin' nothin' 
 But since y'all is stackin' chips, [unintelligible] see 'dem police come cuffin'. 
 That's when I might have to hide out, 
 Or dip through the hood with the chrome and the wool when I pull that ride out... 
 Got a screen that slide out... 
 When the jump-out boys gone, 
 I'm out here 
 If you wanna get [blank] them blows 
 I'm out here 
 If you plottin' on a mission to get me 
 I'm out here 
 If you wanna see [sounds like]the Twista in your city 
 I'm out here
