What's your flava 
 Tell me what's your flava (x4) 
 Girl you look to delicious bootylicious my words vary 
 And Fruitylicious strawberry dressed in cranberry 
 And I'm a penant shows how my jeans was blueberry 
 My truck colour flip the kings of purple to cranberry 
 A college cherry I heard she in love with the don 
 The first time I met I could tell she taste like butter pecan 
 If you don't think your tasty than baby go head save it 
 Cause Twista be messing with the flavors like Craig David 
 Tell 'em dogg 
 I met this fly girl in the club 
 Went by the name of pecan deluxe 
 This ice cream was high maintenance 
 When I took her out, 
 Man it cost me 20 bucks 
 Met this chick named walnut whip 
 Nearly made me sick to the point of throwing up 
 So I called chocolate chip 
 Wit the sweet toffe crisp 
 And I still can't get enough 
 Your what I want 
 Your what I need 
 I wanna taste ya (taste ya) take ya home wit me 
 You look so good 
 Good enough to eat 
 I wonder if I can peel your wrapper 
 If I can be your fantasy 
 What's your flava 
 Tell me what's your flava (x4) 
 I take 'em in the middle of July 
 With tha drop top down in the park 
 When it's summerin' 
 These ice creams lookin' so fly 
 That I just can't lie 
 It all seems too bewildering 
 They got these grown men, 
 Running round... 
 Screaming out... 
 Acting worse than children... 
 But who flow... 
 Better know... 
 Better stack cheddar... 
 Get more tongue... 
 Better than this ice-cream... 
 Better than... 
 Your what I want 
 Your what I need 
 I wanna taste ya (taste ya) take ya home wit me 
 You look so good 
 Good enough to eat 
 I wonder if I can peel your wrapper 
 Be your fantasy 
 What's your flava 
 Tell me what's your flava (x4) 
 Baby maybe we can all cut see who you can call up 
 Girl I eat you all up you's a black walnut 
 Now gimme the cookies 'n' cream and some chocolate chip mint 
 Screamin licky licky while I'm leanin on some pimp shit 
 Went to a baller spot ran into a butterscotch 
 Girl you make me wanna dance you gonna shake your butt or not 
 She think she kinda tough bet she taste lick rocky road 
 Tropical when she got in the truck ooh girl your body cold 
 Hey, I'm taking em, apple and cinnamon 
 Girls aren't feeling 'em can't stop drippin' em 
 That's why they got me dribbling 
 Hot fudge sauce on the soles of my timberlands. 
 I them caramel with a hint of vanilla 
 Wit a little chocolate sprinkling 
 That make me spend my dividends 
 These sweet things make me feel like a kid again 
 Your what I want 
 Your what I need 
 I wanna taste ya (taste ya) take ya home wit me 
 You look so good 
 Good enough to eat 
 I wonder if I can peel yopur wrapper 
 Be your fantasy 
 What's your flava 
 Tell me what's your flava (x4)
