Now when it comes to blowing dro you know I gots the bomb, 
 Quick to dump these bullets up in your ass like le braun, 
 Got me bustin' at these haters, I'm a motherfucking killer, 
 Just call me the westside mobster, I'm your real ass nigga, 
 Motherfuckers try to play me 'cause they know I get my cash on, 
 Do a 187 with this motherfucking mask, jumpin' up outta the truck, 
 Deeper-est bass on this bomb b, **Don't know what he says** left his brains on the conrete, 
 Now I gets more paper then the rest of these ballers, 
 Runnin' tat for tat, the street sweeper from the corner, 
 Never catch me slippin, 'cause I'm gonna keep a trey pound, lay down, 
 Blast on that ass 'cause I'm from K town, Nigga, 
 They hated since from the very start, so I shitted on the game, 
 That's why twista gots, no heart,(ain't no love bitch) twista gots, no heart,(ain't no love bitch) 
 That's why twista gots no heart,(ain't no love bitch) 
 Better shoot a nigga up, Better shoot a nigga up if he don't wanna get me my pay-ah (ain't no love bitch) 
 Kill a nigga for the dust, Kill a nigga for the dust, 'cause it's the chi town way-ah (ain't no love bitch) 
 Better shoot a nigga up, Better shoot a nigga up if he don't wanna get me my pay-ah (ain't no love bitch) 
 Kill a nigga for the dust, Kill a nigga for the dust, 'cause it's the chi town way-ah (ain't no love bitch) 
 It's me and 22 twista, rollin', 6 fo, impala on gold, its top back, glock on my lap, 
 LAPD patrolin, ghetto bird over my shoulders, ima boss, 
 And I catch bullets in the field like randy moss, moss, 
 I'm the face of L.A, got L.A on my face, hydrolics in the trunk, and the cake by the safe, 
 I don't bathing Apes, I got the reallers in jail, 
 I wear hoodies for real, you wear hoodies like pharrell, 
 Pharrell, got pastell colours on him, I got a TV in the range showing colours on it, 
 Selling candy brain, its for lovers only, push coke till I die put my dead brother on it, 
 As I ride with my gun and my vest, niggas in the chi call me kanye west, 
 'Cause when I'm fresh outta henisey I'm buying the bar, 
 Toast for my niggas, shining the pen. 
 Better shoot a nigga up, Better shoot a nigga up if he don't wanna get me my pay-ah 
 Kill a nigga for the dust, Kill a nigga for the dust, 'cause it's the chi town way-ah 
 Better shoot a nigga up, Better shoot a nigga up if he don't wanna get me my pay-ah 
 Kill a nigga for the dust, Kill a nigga for the dust, 'cause it's the chi town way-ah
