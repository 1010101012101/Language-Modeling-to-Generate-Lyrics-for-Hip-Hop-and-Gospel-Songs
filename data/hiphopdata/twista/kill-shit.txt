This is the trip 
 The best part I, really really like 
 Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number 
 Ayo, Kali, kill 'em 
 Kali baby 
 Know we claim we insane seeing Strange do the same thing 
 Drain the main vein on mainstream they plain janes 
 Tell 'em wake it off, tell 'em knock it off, (mane, mane) 
 Tell if they penciling pick 'em off (Like the primetime) 
 Coming out the middle is the reason we done took so long 
 Give 'em this just a little when they d-do it to my song 
 I'mma make you do a song, sick it to you a song 
 Fluents keep movin in the middle with pillows they chewing on 
 Other rappers ain't compatible, they be fallible 
 If you wanna challenge me with a battle we better saddle up 
 I work for battlers, seal it by pittlin pattilin 
 Tittling tattling rattle them till they had enough 
 And like old liquor, kali can speak easy, be breezy 
 And if I lick her, kali can freak easy, your breezy 
 Little shitter and like in P.E. O-N-C's 
 And if they different than me 
 Then they can be eat me in season 
 Ah uh, I'm ripping my mouth off 
 And the niggas that mouth off 
 I'm taking they top off 
 I'm the dope, and you are the drop-off 
 My niggas are not soft, ignorants pop off, hot sauce 
 I'm coming from the planet of Barbie 
 When niggas are niggas are awfully, I feel like keeping my car keys 
 Spreadin that spark, and pick up a clip in a heartbeat 
 Sit in the star seat, then I'm getting back to killing 'em softly 
 Why you gotta do it on me on the c-c-choppers when I did it in the beginning 
 I hit it on it, just the type of me to show 'em I'm a c-c-c-c 
 Just put put 'em in a blender and hit it on it 
 See they be shaking the fact 
 Put a snake into the record for the sake of the bat 
 Uh, maybe stare at ya act 
 Put the safety from rabies, and maybe that they never had 
 That Krizz cray 
 Better yet, call me Kali baby 
 Really will deliver it in any kind of way 
 I slow it down for it to be easier to say 
 Totally awesome dude 
 I'm a predator and you're awesome food 
 It's better than when I was offin you 
 From up here there's a pretty damn awesome view 
 And a moment of silence, we just lost a few 
 Ah uh, bring that back now 
 You already know the outcome 
 How 'bout turnin' up the volume 
 And watch me kill shit 
 You already know what I'm talking 'bout 
 If you don't understand the words that's coming out my mouth 
 Then watch me kill shit 
 Twista! They call me Mr. Malevolent 
 With a style to show that I'm another pistol that's elegant 
 Kaliko to cut the throat of me no patrollin me 
 Nickin every syllable that's strong enough to lift up an elephant 
 I consist that you're as soft as a moccasin 
 I can send niggas at you and have 'em take away your oxygen 
 I could then murder you in another dimension 
 Of diabolical proportions as I find a portal and lock them in 
 Eat the key up then re-up I'm gone 
 See the way that I re-up a G up, I'm on 
 Now I'mma hang my feet up from reeboks, it's on 
 Niggas this ain't a game put your wii up, I'm grown 
 I'm general militia and you be feelin' every person 
 Though everybody can spit it but we still a very 
 Packin so much artillery we are like a military 
 And no tellin' how many bodies we bout kill and bury 
 Gimme the block then I'mma ball 
 Because I be tippin 
 Spending the money when I'm in the mall like tryna be different 
 Different kinda clothes 
 Other kinda shoes 
 When the hoes see the swag they be askin if they can come and kick it 
 Shorty what you talkin' bout just get your homies and come with it I'm over here Gettin' drunk up the limousine 
 Now I got a drunken fast flow 
 But it don't matter I can still blow the whole party to smithereens 
 Splittin' words in the middle like kali- 
 Ko we Killin' 'em cause you put together a team 
 As if you were Pat Riley 
 'Cause ain't nobody compara- 
 Ble to us if you want it then you know what it means 
 Twista! 
 Ay-yay-yay-yay-yay A. Yates 
 You don't know the handle then you're a day late 
 Death and destruction it is they fate 
 Because when I get up on a track, it'll be like wait 
 Sick 'em deliver, get to flipping 
 You be the victim and I'mma pick 'em off 
 Fix 'em with a quick, and I'mma knock division off of niggas 
 No living giving or igging on the rigorous 
 Look at this, will somebody look at this 
 I be killing em 
 Put up or shut up, get up be cut up 
 It's animosity 
 Foot in ya gut up, bullet for colors 
 I'm an atrocity, wicked 
 I went around, arrange one off, I rip it 
 I'd rather be red and ready then running with the rigits 
 Don't be stupid, if you got a minute better run away 
 You better jump I'm slumping you cause 
 Never gonna put the gun away 
 You better back up off of me or get it 
 Admit it, I'm killing off everybody and then it 
 Acquitted 
 And we knocking, he stopping 
 Never can beat the cleverness 
 She joshing, me cocking 
 Coming to get the head of the Chula 
 I shoot her because lots a Gouda 
 That dude'll be foolery, because I socked the ruler 
 Ay yay yay yay yay yay 
 Yank em, when he thinking he better then Nina 
 I gotta spank em, shank 'em with the thang 
 For thinking that we'll come and give up the game 
 We hang the really bane in my sanctum 
 They don't really wanna see me 
 Tecca Nina eating your whole supper like Ziti 
 When I get to going, I smoke a nigga like a beady 
 I'm leaving 'em all dead lips blacker than Miss Sealy
