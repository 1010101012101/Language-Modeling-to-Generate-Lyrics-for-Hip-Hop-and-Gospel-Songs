Twista talking: 
 Uh, Uh, Y'all already know what it is 
 Niggaz talkin' bout Twista this Twista that 
 All I know is Twista rap I spit nigga, fuck y'all, check it out 
 Twista rhyming: 
 Twis' got skill Yes I kill 
 I could ride on they ass like Buffalo Bill 
 I be winnin' in the game like them niggas in the south 
 If a nigga talkin' shit I'm quick to hit 'em in the mouth 
 Them lyrics that's the shit I be equipped to spit 'em out 
 And Imma make a nigga sick 'cause I got venom in the mouth 
 Antonyms and synonyms are spinnin him out of his route 
 And I got bricks of money bitch and I can't fit 'em in the couch 
 Kill 'em with the ride paints hard with the deep dish 
 Kill 'em wit syllables quick wit 8 bars in a sequence 
 I am the bidness I gotta charge you to peep this 
 Niggaz can't see me I'm ray Charles or a eclipse 
 Stevie in the blackout see me with the Mack out 
 Twista gon get money like a GD in a crack house 
 When it come to flows Imma spit 'em like they cold 
 When it come to niggaz heads Imma split it like a pole 
 Take away they swag and shit on they cocky style 
 'Cause my lyrics be too quick they call me Twista Pacquiao 
 Come solo wit my k-olo when you see my logo come take my photo when I'm on promo 
 Niggas wanna get me they better pick a new regimen 
 Shit too sick B somebody better go get you medicine 
 Not bringin' up Twista I'm makin' the issue relevant 
 Balls bigger than mine betta go get 2 elephants 
 I be getting grimy but you and yo click too elegant 
 Beat yo face up till yo jaw tissue look like a pelican 
 I be steady whoopin yo ass just fo the hell of it 
 Can't nobody fuck wit me the planet is celibate 
 I kick a hot flow, get it like Harpo 
 Brief when I rhyme teeth shine like a car show 
 Wit a thick bitch, go head check out my cargo 
 You know one gon be wit me wherever my car go 
 Where yo baby at where yo white Mercedes 
 At ill let you borrow the Bentley as long as you bring it back 
 Here, a couple stacks, you ain't gotta pay me back 
 Me and yo boss kick it and he know where the ladies at 
 Whether we comin' and killin' and murderin 'cause I beat down the block 
 Or because I'm like ?throw ya hands up' 'cause it's hip hop 
 I'd rather be rappin' about the streets and makin' a quick pot 
 But it's time to do something so the shorties don't get popped 
 Meanwhile back to the lab I got the desert eagle 
 Come on yo muthafuckin tip and kill a lot of people 
 Throw up on a priest let him know I ain't no reverend 
 Either dat I go where the fuck I want I'm up in heaven evil 
 U ain't gotta tell me I know I spit bars sick 
 E-mail, anthrax, flows kick arsenic 
 G-up genie and throw it up I'm car sick 
 Cut raw dope deez nigga cut garbage 
 Lethargic give a bitch hard dick see my niggaz and I say salute like a sergeant 
 Can't lie I'm one of the coldest artists so I wouldn't have yo bitch up in my apartment 
 So I be passin out fuck you flyers da fakers and heaters and then fuck liars 
 If yo' shit ain't one been one minded the swine flu h1n1 virus 
 Am I like Jason no I'm more like Michael Myers 
 I am the shit I need to wear diapers 
 When I spit it sometimes I'm all to philosophical 
 Blame it on the Don Julio and killer tropical 
 Twista got more swag than a rich sissy 
 But don't get prissy muthafuckas can get grilly 
 Imma balla and a boss and yes I'm finna get paid 
 Takin' flames to the head like I'm Nicolas Cage 
 I ghost ride the whip I'm finna get laid 
 Any niggaz dat try to get me is finna get sprayed 
 One day it's possible dat I'm finna get saved 
 But for now I be getting money I'm finna get paid muthafucka 
 Fucka... fucka... fucka... fucka
