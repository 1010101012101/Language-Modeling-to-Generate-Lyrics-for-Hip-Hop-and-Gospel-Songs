 (Twista) 
 Girl you look tootlylicious, bootylicious

 An frootylicious, strawberry dress the cranberry 
 An allma penny shirts an ma jeans was blueberry 
 My truck colour flip pink to purple to cranberry 
 I caught this cherry, I heard she in love with the dyme 
 First time I met her I could tell she tastes like one of kind 
 If you don't think you tasty then baby go head save it 
 'Cause Twista be messin with the flavas by Craig David 
 Tell 'em dawg 
 (Craig David) 
 I met this fly girl in the club 
 Went by the name of pecan deluxe 
 This ice-cream was high maintenance 
 When I took her out, 
 Nearly cost me 20 bucks 
 Met this chick named walnut whip 
 Nearly made me sick till the point of throwin' up 
 So I called chocolate chip 
 With the sweet toffee crisp 
 An I still can't get enough 
 Your what I want 
 Your what I need 
 I wanna taste you (taste ya) take ya home with me 
 You look so good 
 Good enough to eat 
 I wonder if I could peel your wrapper 
 (I could be your fantasy) 
 What's your flava 
 Tell me what's your flava (4x) 
 I take 'em in the middle of July 
 With tha drop top down in the park 
 When its summerin 
 These ice-creams lookin' so fly 
 That I just can't lie 
 It all seems to bewilderin 
 They got these grown men 
 Runnin' round... 
 Screamin out... 
 Actin' worse than children... But i 
 Flow better... 
 Know better... 
 Stack cheddah... 
 Get more tongue... 
 Better than this ice-cream 
 Better than... 
 (Twista) 
 Baby maybe we can out cut 
 See you, you can crowl up 
 Girl I eat you awl up 
 Use a black walnut 
 Now gimme the cutest ice-cream 
 An some chocolate chip mints 
 Screamin licky licky while I'm leanin on some pimp shit 
 Went to a better spot, ran into a butter scotch 
 Girl you make me wanna dance 
 You gon' shake it but I'm not 
 She think she cannot tell bet she taste like apple roll 
 Tropical when she got on the truck 
 Ooh girl you body flow
