(Chorus - Ray J) 
 If we keep bumpin up against this wall 
 They gon' call the police (woo ooh woo ooh) 
 And if we keep makin' all this noise 
 They gon' call the police (woo ooh woo ooh) 
 Don't wake up my neighbors 
 People got to go to work (woo ooh woo ooh) 
 And if we keep makin' all this noise 
 They gon' call the police (woo ooh woo ooh) 
 (Twista) 
 Hit it up against the wall like a beast 
 Hit it out in the hall like freak 
 How we're doing what we're doing 
 I don't see how nobody up in the building 
 Gettin' no sleep 
 How we get it in, we gonna get put out 
 For steady makin' noise bumpin up against the headboard 
 And they be hatin' somebody gon' come and beat on the door 
 "Get off of the landlord" 
 I'm a freak up in the sheets 
 Especially when I'll be fuckin' to the beat 
 The neighbors said if we keep it up 
 They gonna have to call the police 
 And we're gonna be up in the streets (woo ooh woo ooh) 
 'Cause I act like a fool 
 And my chick knows she gets so pumped when she bump 
 Like a thump in a trunk on the couch where she hump but instead 
 It goes bumpity bump 
 We're about to get put out this hotel if you keep on screaming 
 We're about to get put out the crib if you keep on screaming 
 Girl your love is terrific 
 And Whenever I hit it 
 We never know how loud we was 
 We makin' too much noise turn the radio up 
 And put a sock in yo mouth because... 
 Imma hit it like (uh) 
 We gon' do it like (uh) 
 We gon' do it like (uh) 
 Baby turn around 
 On the bed like (uh) 
 On the couch like (uh) 
 On the floor like (uh) 
 Steady make a sigh... 
 Got lil momma sounding 
 The way she be doin' when she play with all them toys 
 We better stop all this noise 
 They gon' mess around 
 And call them boys (woo ooh woo ooh) 
 I get it bumpin in the house 
 And we makin' everybody in they rooms sick 
 And all of my neighbors be trippin' 
 And beatin' on the ceiling with they're broomstick 
 And if we decide to sip a little liquor 
 Let me go and see where I can find some from 
 The damage Imma do when I get back is a guarantee 
 Somebody call 911 
 All the freaky noise that you make it be makin' 
 Me want you to get up 
 Let me put this pillowcase in yo face 
 Before you wake somebodies kids up 
 Even though I pay the rent for the crib 
 I don't really wanna cause a riot because 
 They gon' call it domestic violence 
 So we got to do it in silence because...
