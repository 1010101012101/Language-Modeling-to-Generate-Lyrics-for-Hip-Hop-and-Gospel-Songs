 Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one 
 Yeah, so I can creep up on her, so I can ease up on her 
 So I can get touch and feelin' 
 Put a dip in ya back and get me one slow jam 
 Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one 
 Yeah, so I can creep up on her 
 Everybody's tryin' to get with somethin'

 When it come to ballin' I do it with no hands 
 Left the Lamborghini at home and took the Brougham 
 (Damn) 
 I think the club finna close man but I be the Twista 
 You know how I be doin' it with the slow jams 
 Take a look at the shawty chillin' by the door 
 Man, I'm really into her persona 
 'Cause she don't be takin' drama but she thick 
 When I ask her where she get 
 Then she say she get it from her momma 
 So I think I'ma pop champagne 'cause the glass tall 
 The bartender said it was the last call 
 I told her give it to me fast so we can slow dance 
 And I can put my hands on her ass 
 (Yes) 
 And she like it when I hold and grip control them hips 
 And you know I like it when she get low and dip 
 Plenty swagger when she move slow and sip 
 When they cut the lights on you gon' roll with The Twist 
 Lookin' so lovely in the fit, you got on 
 But it don't matter if you was in a dress or you in some jeans 
 Fragrance by Adidas, purse from another country 
 Look at you, girl, you doin' yo' thing 
 Everybody leavin' with somebody and I gotta get me somebody 
 So I be doin' what I do, gotta get me one too 
 Before the night go, I tell the maestro that's yo' cue 
 Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one 
 Yeah, so I can creep up on her, so I can ease up on her 
 So I can get touch and feelin' 
 Put a dip in ya back and get me one slow jam 
 Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one 
 Yeah, so I can creep up on her 
 Everybody's tryna get wit somethin' 
 Can I get one slow jam? 
 On my way to the floor, baby, hold on to my shoulders 
 Girl, I won't let you fall, just hold on to my shoulders 
 She was lookin' nice, too hot for the carveya 
 She a melt the ice, lil' mamma kinda 
 Like Rihanna, she was livin' the life she be given advice 
 But just to have an orgasm she gotta get a device 
 What's that for? Is ya man, a boy? 
 'Cause he don't know how to give you what you here for 
 I think I gotta show you what the pilot get for 
 And the question is what I whisper in ya ear for 
 You nasty, love be on top, mad if I pop 
 If you miss the drop, you nasty, how you made me choke 
 You told me I can put it anywhere I want to 
 Sex so good she do it with no hands 
 I met you while the DJ was playin' the slow jam 
 As soon as we got into it into my slow dance 
 It's the beginnin' is when I was feelin' the romance 
 Now I be Twista with the super tight flow one might go 
 That's so cute, I gotta get me one before the night go 
 I tell the maestro that's yo' cue 
 Yeah, gotta get me one, gotta get me one 
 Yeah, so I can creep up on her, so I can ease up on her 
 So I can get touch and feelin'
