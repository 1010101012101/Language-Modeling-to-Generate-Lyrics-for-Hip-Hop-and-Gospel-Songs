(Liffy Stokes) 
 The stress of everyday living is slowly corrupting my soul 
 I'm 2 months out the joint on papers walking with 3 years parole 
 I did 4 and a half a slab and shit a nigga was dying 
 I'm finally back in the world and its hard but I'm still trying 
 Not to fall and risk my freedom again trying to ball 
 While waiting for this pussy ass job to call 
 And it ain't hopping 
 Got me tipping to hear them things popping 
 Cash bags dropping 
 With plenty of cane for recopping oppurtunity knocking 
 It's what I'm on 
 I cry when I'm at home 'cause I'm alone 
 24 years and grown with a future unknown 
 My heart was torn from the pain of being back in the game 
 But I'd rather die getting my hussle on and live like a lane 
 So its back to pistols and cane 
 Plotting on licks hitting stains 
 The mob life runs through my veins 
 It's too late for me to change 
 These streets got me deranged 
 Strapped up and paranoid 
 Ready to add on situations I can and can't avoid 
 Plus big voices getting hot 
 They constantly sneaking on blocks 
 They trying to bring me in unconscious 
 But them pins got popped 
 Now they got me on the run 
 Cherishing every last breath 
 But I ain't going back 
 Its freedom or death 
 That be my motive for murder 
 (Begin CHORUS) 
 (Liffy Stokes) 
 Now I know you the judge of life and death 
 I ain't evil or nothing 
 But somebody done brought me pain and sorrow 
 So I'ma have to kill something 
 Let me count the ways that I can repent 
 Trying to stay holy and focused 
 But that evil in his eyes let me know that nigga too bogus 
 That be my motive for murder 
 (Twista) 
 I'ma survive these streets another day 
 I know the pain in my heart won't go away 
 These mother fuckers try to murder me 
 And won't nobdy hurt my family 
 That's what he gotta die 
 (End CHORUS) 
 (Mays) 
 9 times out of 10 you can find Mays trying to hit a better lick 
 If it ain't coming up with the dopest shit 
 Then I'm trying to cop the thickest brick 
 Cause life in the belly of the best 
 Is equal to povertys bottomless pit 
 Where bitch niggas trick 
 And thirsty mother fuckers beat you out of everything you get 
 But it seems like everybodys trying to make some type of come up 
 Quick 
 Before it's too late to get straight 
 And the most I make is final pick 
 Anywhere they shit like riding slick 
 With a thick chick slobbing your dick 
 Even if it means fighting these niggas in cases 
 As long as neither ones thick 
 'Cause I swear when I get hit 
 I go in a crucial rage like a flick 
 Turn straight lunatic 
 Making all these bitches niggas hear their final tick 
 But that don't mean my minds sick 
 Just 'cause I'm motivated by a lot of cheese 
 When trees by the p's 
 And fuckin' fine fee's and 3's with ease 
 For sho the skilled poets 
 Within in the mask up kill for it 
 I'll whoop a fiend with a crushed grill 
 I'll bet his dumb ass'll stil blow it 
 Bullshit ain't nothing 
 I'm trying to get this first mil in the bank 
 And drive a bullet-proof hummer tank 
 So the next haters who try to air me out come up blank 
 And I'ma have to sacrifice your life 
 With a wrath that's stronger than Christ 
 And forces of life that's know to do damage to human eyesight 
 I guess its true 
 Moneys the route of all evil 
 Cause crooked or legal 
 It's all manipulated by the eagle 
 And be my motive for murder 
 (Twista) 
 Lord knows I was hurt from a judge from the start 
 How I'ma hide love from this mark 
 This nigga made my homie die in my arms 
 Had to put a slug in his heart 
 Mother fuck that stuff 
 It was just a grudge on his part 
 My boy was young and ambitious 
 Took his dreams and wishes 
 Try to do right but my attitude like blast them bitches 
 Drowning all my sorrows in bottles of yack 
 And a quarter ounce of dro want a rap 
 I'm bout to snap 
 Here come the big pay back 
 Looking up on the dresser for the black and gray strap 
 I'm crying and shit 
 I was hurt so bad I felt I had to go kill him 
 Even if a slug hit him 
 I was still hurt enough to aim at myself and die with him 
 Can't control them pains 
 Now its time to throw them thangs 
 Visions of the stud don't stay 
 Empty the clip of am out right 
 Ambulance come around 
 By the time the hypes 
 Taking of his nikes 
 I know it sound cold 
 But this bullet put a hole in my soul 
 ?Never shorties years stole? 
 He was only 17 years old 
 And at the funeral I got to watch his mama's tears roll 
 And I know he used to wild sometimes 
 Carry a 9 but you took away your sunshine 
 No more reminising on the fun times 
 Balling and coming at bitches with blunt lines 
 But this nigga ain't going to want mine 
 For the pain I'ma handle this funk and dismantle this junk 
 Fuck all that 
 In all black and then pumped 
 To run up on this nigga 
 Tip up on him then jump 
 Mission to kill armed with a fist full of steel 
 Eyes gleam with the fury 
 Never thought I'd be facing to 2 mothers 
 In front of a prosecuting team and a jury 
 How did one murder turn into 2 
 Revenge had me shooting thorugh hate 
 I couldn't stop 
 In the mist of the action 
 Is when that little ? got shot 
 All because of my motive for murder
