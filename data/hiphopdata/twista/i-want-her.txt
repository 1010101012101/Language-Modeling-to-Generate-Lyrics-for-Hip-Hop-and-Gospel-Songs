 Then roll wit me in the Bentley White pearl

 Especially when I be sippin hypnotique 
 Got me feelin' like I'm smokin' on cronic 
 When we fuckin' it be so exotic 
 Now I know that I be turnin' on fiyay wit Mariah 
 And she know she be dealin' wit a balla 
 Can't go fast 'cause I'm heavy through the wire 
 Fulfillin? desires like a chi shot calla

 Do you love when I hit it from the back too 
 Let me feel how you work it that one way 
 Come on baby girl let me see what that do 
 Mariah: 
 I wish that we could 
 Blow out the speakers 
 Over N Over 
 To then jokes to secrets 
 Forever your lady 
 You act right then maybe 
 Ain't nothing to talk about 
 Put the music loud 
 So they won't hear me say 
 Ah-hahaha ah!

 Tired of being so lonely? come hold me

 Twista: 
 Now we pullin up out the garage 
 In the platinum blue arnage 
 Me and you about to hit that club 
 To the bar so we can sip that bud 
 Both of us together we would be the livest 
 If I had to break it down how would I describe it 
 (Ah- ahahaha ah!) 
 We the type of couple when we get up on each other 
 We get it crackin' in the kitchen or the bedroom 
 It don't matter where we at we be makin' noise 
 So play the track so the base will make ya head boom 
 Break ya off when here one leg up 
 And you know I like the way you put it on me 
 It's the eastcoast queen and the midwest Mob Boss? 
 Shorty I will never leave ya lonely
