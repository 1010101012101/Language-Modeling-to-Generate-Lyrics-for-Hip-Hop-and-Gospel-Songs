Yeah we gonna do it like this 
 Mobsters reign, we hope you feel this 
 Speedknot Mobsters 
 My click been strugglin half a lifetime tryin' to get our shit on 
 Got no G's to sit on, even so niggas sell packs to get on 
 But let me take you to a place 
 Where these niggaz learn to better pain and stress 
 Look a murderer in the face, comin' up with a wilder range you're blitzed 
 1, 2, 3, and to the 44, the good, the bad, and the ugly sticken you 
 Fleein through the front door, and we gotta do one more 
 Even though dealer watchin me like the lottery 
 We can still fulfill this westside oddessy mobster prophecy 
 Well mobbin what can be better than weed, drinks, bitches and loot? 
 Hangin' off 20 G's cause you got more money to scoop 
 Lives a hustler by nature, fiend for paper, schemes and capers 
 Constantly eyed by neighbors, who do the Feds favors? 
 It ain't no major dough, what this lady yeya blow 
 As long as its payin' me for my occupation criminal 
 Pullin up on hoes, as the weed smoke blows, the absence of a mobsters presence 
 Is the reason she chose, as the regency rolls, it rolls, the pearl white O's 
 Mobile, shit I'm a ride high till I die, get killed 
 Smoke like fields, forever dodgin blue shields, 
 We're blue steel I got full proof escape skills 
 We're paper chasin leavin' trails of shell cases 
 And chasin to the part of your body 
 Where the bloods wasted, on the life taken 
 Chicago ain't a city it's a nation 
 It's all this my foundation within the mobster organization 
 If it's gonna be shakin it up, if it's gonna be cookin it up 
 If it ain't hustlin and we got some skunk we gonna be smokin' it up 
 (Well I'm a payin' mobster for life, caught with gold and ice) 
 (Speedknots roll two shots too cold to die, know I'm a get high) 
 It's an everyday thang for my Speedknot Mob to hang 
 Callin cops for thangs, readin to squab or bang 
 Takin' your riches, 'cause we know we snatchin your bitches 
 The wish I reign my family gotta maintain, it's a mobster thang 
 I'm a fat booty fuckin', love gettin' the sucks in and bustin' 
 Givin' niggers punkin heads for nothin', while bumpin, handle my functions 
 My pistles pumpin, got hoes jumpin', a mobstas always into somethin' 
 I can feel Killuminati lookin' over my shoulder 
 Somethin' keeps tellin' me to get mine before it's over 
 Smokin' on plenty of buddahs, the brand to get blessed, with forgiveness 
 For the last time I'm sent on the survivin quest 
 From hustlin 24-7 to makin' niggas get undressed 
 The mobster in me got to be obsessed 
 With lucci and success, so I can care less 
 If I gotta be lootin and woopin, 
 I'm sick of beggin niggas for rides 
 Id rather be the one that's scoopin 
 Cause in these last days its day to day hustlin for me, I won't rest here 
 Everyday 
 Fat ass chain and 3 blades, 
 Trippin' on that 2 faced, that nigga sweatin dick 
 While I rock the stage, 
 Like these bitches is just tryin' to get paid to give a nigga AIDS 
 Like I can use it for turnin' tricks 
 Or either for hittin licks and then rap about the shit 
 In one the mobster's greastest hits, 
 And when we come to your town (?) then raise it 
 Finest skunk we just can roll it up and blaze it 
 I'm gonna make it through this New World Order if I gotta be rappin' and robbin 
 You can't stop the Speedknot from mobbin and if you try we squabin 
 We waitin for you to fall off the square so you best keep your head up 
 When these shots how niggas roll, 'cause we don't believe in goin' head up 
 On this week 100's, 50's, and dubs, trigger finger itchy with snubs 
 Hit me wit love, black gloves, red eyes (?) 
 T-shirt up on my face, fucked up and ready, I cocked the 380, 
 Got a grip that was steady adrenaline 
 Rushin po-feddy, while lives is rolled with Sisqo 
 May we rock the tightest flows but tinto up with the clips though 
 Gotta find out what yo pockets hit fo, 'cause I ain't that scummie 
 Mother fuck (?) got no time for rockin', 
 Choppin in the car stoppin' with a stack ofpacked money 
 But you trustin me, then I cup this shit, 
 Snatch all of your luxury, try touchin me 
 Actin' tough as shit, my moms is a bust for me 
 Fuckin' me or make me hate you, 
 Permanently sedate you, when the bullet penetrate 
 You its goin' straight for your face you, unless we chase you 
 When we escape through your pockets 
 By all means necessary the rest is secondary 
 Comin' for back till my flesh is buried, the test is carried for me to survive 
 And hope we still will be thick, with a trilogy click but now seven 
 Mobstability shit 
 Ha, I just take a pull in the hail, 
 Thinkin' about my niggas that's locked up in jail 
 My mind dwells on crime sales, we wipin off mad shells 
 Only time will tell if we gotta use em' 
 Ain't lookin' for stack, but if we got into it 
 We gotta do it, ha, mobster anthem for life
