 I'm going home 
 U keep on talking all that shit up on ya 2-way and ya phoonnee 
 Girl, but when I get you home (hit it, hit it uh oh)

 And the house is (A A) 
 And the bed is (I I) 
 Bathroom is (O O) 
 And the kitchen is (U U)

 (1st Verse - Twista:) 
 Now come and tell me where you get dat from 
 Now Twista he out here messing with all da ladies 
 Ask what I wanna hit dat fo' 
 'Cause you sexy and I'm a balla baby 
 Ask me why I got a nasty mouth 
 U da one steady trippin' wit da sassy mouth 
 But when get you into da apartment that's when it get up and sparkin 
 And that's when we let all da passion out 
 Like da way you walk in slow in da room 
 And smelling sweet as a rose 
 And looking good in da red thong 
 Looking thick as hell do it to me well 
 Got me sprung 
 And I know I got ya head gone 
 Either slow or faster girl 
 When I gone how you trippin' is a disaster 
 When I step up to da tunes of da neptunes you wanna bring drama 
 And that's when I gotta ask you girl why 
 (2nd Verse - Twista:) 
 When you were sleep last night 
 After rubbin you down and making passionate love 
 I put on a pair of Air Force Ones, six figures of jewelry 
 And met my guyz at da club 
 Pulled up out front and we had to stunt 
 Homie was sittin' on 26s 
 We about to do da dummy from da blow 
 Blow a little money steady in da scummy wit these bitches 
 That's about when you stunt in da car 
 Tell my whole mothafuckas how I stunt at da bar 
 'Cause you startin trippin' when you were in da crib sleep 
 But you don't even need to get started at all 
 U know I'm in da V.I.P. 
 Lookin' at all this ass and I'm finna to leave 
 I'm finna to cut you as soon as I'm out 
 But you steady you gotta gotta wit da mothafuckin drama 
 Girl shut up what da fuck is talkin' about 
 (3rd Verse - Pharrell:) 
 Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey 
 Girl don't you worry about me fallin' to sleep 
 Girl it's early 
 I'll kiss you up from ya head to feet don't you worry 
 My appetite is no thin, sweet and nothin' so curvy 
 I grab you like we don't have all night 
 Even though it's early 
 Trippin' on me when I go to da mall 
 Trippin' on me when I go to da club 
 Trippin' on me when I kick it wit my boyz 
 U be trippin' on me when I'm on da tour bus 
 U don't trip when I getcha gone 
 U don't trip when I getcha chrome 
 U be trippin' on me when I'm away from u 
 But I bet you don't trip when I get you home 
 I I
