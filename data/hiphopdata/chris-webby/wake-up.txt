(Verse 1: Knowledge) 
 I can't go every day with being sober 
 It gets kinda hard tryna cope with this devil on my shoulder 
 Belvi and some soda like, well I'm getting closer 
 To either heaven or hell every second I get older 
 Till I'm dead or in a coma 
 I'ma live life like, "Well it ain't over till it's over" 
 You're supposed to live every day like it was your last 
 But that in itself is a really hard concept for me to grasp, 'cause 
 If this was my last twenty four 
 I'd probably spend at least three of four praying to God for twenty more 
 I'm looking in the mirror at the man in front of me 
 Like I know everybody goes but I'm twenty three 
 That's I come off as reckless, respect it 
 I'm getting my money's worth every second 
 I'm less than perfect, but so are you 
 So who are you to judge me, I don't judge you 
 (Chorus: Three Days Grace sample) 
 I'm not sober all the time 
 You bring me down at least you try 
 Until we see this eye to eye 
 I don't want you

 (Verse 2: Chris Webby) 
 What's life? Fuck life yo I'm telling you what 
 I'm a nineteen year old rebellious fuck 
 Living each day like the next I might not wake up 
 That's why I always stay puffing a blunt with a full cup 
 Popping pills out the bottle till it's hollow 
 I'm going to hell, and y'all are more than welcome to follow 
 And if I'm not here tomorrow light an L in my memory 
 Pour out some Hennessy, fuck it just remember me 
 Gotta know I made a mark on this short time on Earth 
 Since birth I've been spittin' it proving my fucking worth 
 And for what? I try to give a fuck but I can't 
 Guess it sucks to be me, but I am who I am 
 And I am, just a man, who will stand 
 With his hands in front of him 
 Just waiting for some shit to hit the fan 
 And I cannot stop, music fuels my every movement 
 And drug abusin' helps bring creativity to my music 
 I may not be in tune with reality but my music is sick 
 And I'm so high that I defy gravity 
 So fuck being sober 
 Live life and enjoy it 
 'Cause soon enough the ride'll be over
