Yeah 
 We all get to that point in our life 
 Shit really hits the fan 
 And everything seems like it sucks 
 But you know you always gatta think 
 Everything happened for a reason 
 You know what I'm saying? 
 Everybody make mistakes, I'm the first to admit it 
 But once you make the choice you're forced to live with it 
 Some people never get it till they live it 
 And then when the live it it's not a chance that they ever could forget it 
 You wish you could switch you weight on that lawyer visit 
 And we all be dead and gone like I had Timberlake to spit it 
 The way I have been living my life just wouldn't cut it 
 Head always in the clouds 
 With an attitude like "fuck it" but that's just immaturity 
 And surely I figured out thoroughly that that was only hurting me 
 Now I need a purposely to get my life back on track 
 And leave some things in the past 
 Its as simple as that 
 Some people say that I'm not worth it 
 I make mistakes but no body's perfect 
 I guess ill give it a try 
 I got one last chance 
 To get myself together 
 Can't lose no more time 
 Its now or never. 
 And I try to remember who I used to be 
 I got one last chance to get myself together 
 Sometime you need to realize 
 You got one last chance when the outcome of your life 
 Rest within the judges hands 
 And I'll never understand how one man with a gavel 
 Can decide if you future is worth being unraveled 
 Or take away your patle 
 And send you right down shits 
 For as long as the dude sees fit 
 See it's a tuff ass world that we live in 
 You could find yourself in prison over one wrong decision 
 It's difficult to get this shit out of your mind 
 Wish you could just press rewind go back in time 
 But I've accepted that I need to find the bright side 
 Cause off to the dark is the only thing inside 
 I'll find that silver lining 
 'Cause I gatta keep on rhyming 
 Cause until I reach the top you know I gatta keep on climbing 
 One set back wont stop me 
 I'm still here breathing 
 Believing that even this shit happened for a reason 
 Some people say that I'm not worth it 
 I make mistakes but no body's perfect 
 I guess ill give it a try 
 I got one last chance 
 To get myself together 
 I can't lose no more time 
 Its now or never. 
 And I try to remember who I used to be 
 I got one last chance to get myself together 
 Ooh and I don't wanna be misunderstood 
 (But you gatta understand me) 
 I got to take this chance and make it into something good 
 (You gatta always find the bright side) 
 Some people say that I'm not worth it 
 I make mistakes but no body's perfect 
 I guess I'll give it a try 
 (I got one last chance to get my self together 
 Can't lose no more time 
 Its now or never) x3 
 And I try to remember who I used to be 
 I got one last chance to get myself together 
 I got one last chance 
 (Yeah, I got one last chance) 
 (Yes it's all I need) 
 Sometimes 
 (One last chance) 
 You just gatta change everything it up 
 Roll the fuck up 
 You know? 
 You can always bounce back 
 Ha Ha Ha Ha
