Hey ms. daja... alotta people been tellin' me I'm a weirdo 
 Really?...i get that alot too, I don't understand why 
 Well let's get weird on 'em then huh? 
 Oh less go 
 I like dancing in the dark 
 Drink when I'm drving my car 
 Spend all my money on clothes 
 Am I a weirdo? 
 Wear make up to go to bed 
 But I only sleep naked 
 Say anything in my head 
 Am I a weirdo? 
 I like to think of myself, as cool 
 But you gon' say wrong 
 'Cause I'm not you 
 Put my hands up till you hang loose 
 But you gon' say I'm wrong 
 Call me a weirdo 
 Oh oh oh oh weirdo 
 Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo 
 Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal 
 Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo oh 
 Ay yo where's my aderol? 
 You see I'm weird it don't matter to me, 
 Not being like you is what I happen to be 
 When I go I'm rappin' a beat, I'm blazin' shit 
 Because webby gets weird al yancovich 
 Uh all my sanity is stepped away 
 I wear ninja turtle tshirts everyday 
 I got cartoons tatted all over my whole body 
 Am I a weirdo...(duh) yeah prolly 
 I got two pet turtles and a frog 
 A gravity bomb and a fluffy white dog 
 Living in the attic in my parents house 
 I get drunk watching nickelodian on the couch 
 Transform running when I hear the beat 
 Even if strange is what I appear to be 
 I give true to myself and its clear to see 
 That if your not a weirdo, then your weird to me 
 Oh oh oh oh weirdo 
 Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo 
 Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal 
 Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo oh 
 Oh oh oh oh weirdo 
 Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo 
 Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal 
 Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo 
 I'm weird, bizarre, strange and different 
 All my weirdos stay and listen 
 Fittin in, I'm just not with it 
 Am who I am, and I love it live it 
 W-e-i-to the r-d 
 Am I normal? hardly 
 Nerdy, loser, stoner, artsy 
 Lets show em' weirdos are the life of the party 
 And I'm back to spit 
 Saying that I'm not normal is accurate 
 But I be normal to me, so just shut your lips 
 And if you don't like my style, suck my dick 
 I walk around in boxers half the day 
 I am a bum, who would care what I have to say 
 But they still press play 
 So you know what? 
 If you not a weirdo, you better step your game up WHAT? 
 Oh oh oh oh weirdo 
 Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo 
 Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal 
 Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo oh 
 Oh oh oh oh weirdo 
 Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo 
 Oh oh oh oh I think I'm normal 
 Oh oh oh oh I'm not a weirdo 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh
