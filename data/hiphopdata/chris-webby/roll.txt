Yeah, Webby, it's that shit you just roll to 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Hop in the whip... and roll. 
 Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me 
 And I ain't lookin' back 
 Still a kid at heart ain't nobody changin' that 
 Got my mind on my money but I still don't have a stack. 
 But I roll, I roll 
 Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at? 
 One day I'ma make it, so I'll wait until it's that 
 And when I get my turn I swear to God that it's a wrap 
 And I roll I roll 
 Still like a kid but I'm newly 22 though 
 They know me as the chew from CT to Pluto 
 Walk around town everybody givin' kudos. 
 Michael Cera didn't hit it I'm the one who banged Juno. 
 I live life mucho, bueno, smash coolo 
 Shows every week since I linked up with New York, 
 Now I'm on that new flow doin' what I do bro 
 Buzz gettin' bigger than an uncut jew frow. 
 Who knows, I would achieve on this level 
 And prove my teachers wrong 'cause they said I was a rebel, 
 Who never would amount to nothing doin' what I want 
 Always showin' up to class smellin' like a fresh blunt. 
 But I always had it in me I just needed to apply myself 
 And rap's all I've ever loved besides myself. 
 Ha, maybe I'm a little cocky dude but if you spit this tight 
 Then you'd be cocky too. 
 Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me 
 And I ain't lookin' back 
 Still a kid at heart ain't nobody changin' that 
 Got my mind on my money but I still don't have a stack. 
 But I roll, I roll 
 Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at? 
 One day I'ma make it, so I'll wait until it's that 
 And when I get my turn I swear to God that it's a wrap 
 And I roll I roll 
 I roll, roll like a Michelin, everyday I get it in 
 Pop another Ridalin, listen in, 
 I was a goofball never the sober guy, 
 Gettin' high rollin' up, J's playin' Golden Eye, 
 Star fox in a ship facing Andross, 
 Zelda, Gannondorf in a standoff, 
 Battlin' with Bowser fireball flower 
 Sittin' in front of my TV for hours, 
 And though you grow up you still hang on to the past 
 Being young was a blast and you clean up your act 
 And try to make somethin' of it, don't listen to the haters 
 And if you got a passion, then you follow it if you love it 
 That's what I did and shit I'm all right 
 Still livin' with my parents but I'm livin' the life 
 I'll be wakin' up late and I'll party all night 
 'Cause I'm doin' what I love and the future looks bright 
 Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me 
 And I ain't lookin' back 
 Still a kid at heart ain't nobody changin' that 
 Got my mind on my money but I still don't have a stack. 
 But I roll, I roll 
 Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at? 
 One day I'ma make it, so I'll wait until it's that 
 And when I get my turn I swear to God that it's a wrap 
 And I roll I roll 
 You can find me eatin' bacon grilled cheese with my grape juice, 
 Donkey Kong in the flesh like that ape loose, 
 Yeah that's fuckin' right, I could snuff a mic 
 Since I rode my dirty black and white rusted huffy bike, 
 Soon enough I'm in a two door drop 
 With a stack of money greener then a newport box. 
 So I dare you to go and find a dude more hot 
 Buzzin' CT so big I made New York watch 
 Now everybody be recitin' all my raspy quotes 
 Of the skinny white boy with a scratchy throat 
 Now my mix-tapes, everybody has it, 
 'Cause in your iTunes got more Web than your attic does 
 Get it? Just nod if you follow me, 
 You don't gotta like it, but if not just acknowledge me 
 I got an army of ninjas across the US 
 And I'm just doin' what I do best 
 Cause you know I got my whole life ahead of me 
 And I ain't lookin' back 
 Still a kid at heart ain't nobody changin' that 
 Got my mind on my money but I still don't have a stack. 
 But I roll, I roll 
 Can't wait to be the king, yo Simba where you at? 
 One day I'ma make it, so I'll wait until it's that 
 And when I get my turn I swear to God that it's a wrap 
 And I roll I roll
