They say, They say this life is gonna chew you up and spit you right back out 
 But this games all I know about and I know it ain't fair but I'm almost there, I know I'm almost there, 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I'm feeling stuck really what the fuck, I kill it with the lyrics while I struggle for a buck 
 I'm frustrated, feelin' like I shoulda just made it, 
 Making money off of shows but can't even make a payment on a new whip 
 On the edge I'm really bout to lose it, 
 But the fans keep me motivated I know I can do this 
 Its funny, seems like everbody focusing on the lyrical content but I'm barely seeing any money 
 Ill leave your nose runny 'cause I'm so sick yo, 
 Still scrapin together quarters to get bogies down to sicko 
 I know this life has more in store for me, and if it don't then I'll put a pistol to my temple with nobody 
 Forcing me 
 Its costing me blood, sweat, and tears and I hate the shit 
 I love the game this ain't just tryin' to make me rich 
 I love you hip-hop simple as that 
 But how much would it hurt to show a little love back 
 They say, They say this life is gonna chew you up and spit you right back out 
 But this games all I know about and I know it ain't fair but I'm almost there, I know I'm almost there, 
 So close I can taste it, trynna make my way up from the basement, 
 Trynna make my way upstairs but this life ain't fair but I'm almost there I know I'm almost there 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I been chilling in the basement underground 
 They in the master bedroom throwin' bucks around 
 Trynna be original every time I drop a rap 
 But all these labels lookin' for another copy cat 
 Anyone say I'm bitin' Asher or Sam Adams swagger is gettin' knocked out if I catch yas 
 It's bullshit I've been doing this my whole life 
 And you say I'm jockin him just because were both white 
 They he's good but he's no slim shady 
 Well how come every black rapper ain't compared to Jay-Z 
 I never said I was better than Em-kid 
 In my humble opinion Marshall's the best that's ever lived 
 I'm trynna do me and create my own lane 
 And though the haters gossip at least there sayin' my name 
 And if I don't make it then lfe ain't fair but uh at least I know I was almost there 
 They say, They say this life is gonna chew you up and spit you right back out 
 But this games all I know about and I know it ain't fair but I'm almost there, I know I'm almost there, 
 So close I can taste it, trynna make my way up from the basement, 
 Trynna make my way upstairs but this life ain't fair but I'm almost there I know I'm almost there 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 So many damn shows I'm basically on tour 
 So fuck these labels if they ain't knockin' at my door 
 My grass roofs fan base is bigger than these dudes that are signin 
 This is crazy am I losin my mind 
 Dropped five mixtapes in a year and a half 
 No Pop-Tart shit 
 You hear that it's rap 
 And here are the facts 
 I grind harder than most of these dudes do 
 Always got new shit posted on youtube 
 Shout to Khalifa cause me and him are supplying the most free music to your speakers 
 And if you ain't likin it shut your mouth bite your lip 
 I can'tt be stopped there's to much fuckin' fightin Chris 
 This is history pen and hand writin this 
 Poseidon with the flow 
 King Triton bitch 
 So close I can taste it 
 I'll make it 
 Haters smoke a blunt by yourself and just face it. 
 They say, They say this life is gonna chew you up and spit you right back out 
 But this games all I know about and I know it ain't fair but I'm almost there, I know I'm almost there, 
 So close I can taste it, trynna make my way up from the basement, 
 Trynna make my way upstairs but this life ain't fair but I'm almost there I know I'm almost there
