I love women, from brittany spears to marge simpson 
 Just give me a rubber and you know that I'm goin' in son 
 Ain't no tee ball but its still easy to hit them 
 'Cause I know what women wan't, call me mel gibson 
 Yes, 'cause they know we on next 
 They can throw me on set, watch me go beyond sex 
 I ball hard but not in the kobe context 
 I'm collecting v-cards like a pokemon deck muthafucker 
 'Cause I'm on speed to the top 
 Downin a leader of scotch, 'cause like a demon I'm hot 
 Look there's a laundry load full of wife beaters and socks 
 Not even ripley's is sure if they can believe it or not 
 Watch, ill make 'em come to a dead stop 
 'Cause on a beat, imma spit it hard as a pet rock 
 Baby girl, you know I make that bed hot 
 I'm no angel, my only halo came with an x-box 
 Drink till I'm walkin' like a waddlin duck 
 But I can step a straight line just to follow a buck 
 I'm just lookin' for a chicken who can swallow a nut 
 Like a peacan pie in front of joba the hut 
 Wait what? there is no way she could ignore me 
 Grabbin on my woody like andy from toy story 
 With them lips like topanga, ill play the role of corey 
 And sit back and watch you do your thing there shawty 
 'Cause you know you cannot start me 
 12 beers deep and I'm the life of the party 
 Bring a chick back and you know we gettin' naughty 
 Bite her so hard she be like "ouch charlie!" 
 'Cause you know we gets busy 
 Head spinnin like taz so you know we get dizzy 
 Datpiff top 8 with banks, luda, and drizzy 
 Sick as the swine flu, I been fuckin' miss piggy 
 Really its silly that you know this dude's nice 
 Mommy's comin' over and she's spendin a few nights 
 Lyrics like an emo kid's pants man too tight 
 Throwin' mad punches just like pudding in a food fight 
 Ha, so imma hit 'em with low bars 
 'Cause I'm always needin me some M to the O-R 
 E motha fucker and you know that I go hard 
 I'm at the top of my game, ill send you a post card, bitch!
