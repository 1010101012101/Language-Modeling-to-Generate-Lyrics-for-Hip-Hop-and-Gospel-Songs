When it feels like the sky is falling 
 And the world is crumbling down 
 Listen deep inside your body for that 
 Boom clap clap boom clap clap boom clap sound 
 Zippity zippity bap a dee bap 
 Zip zip zoom bap bap boom 
 Bippity bap, clack a dee clap 
 Put one in a whole I{m ready to rap 
 That's what we do when the king in the building 
 That's how we do when the caps start peeling 
 That's how we do when the barrel goes bam 
 That's how we do when the I'm smoking on my gram yeah 
 Tell me what you mother fuckers really wanna do 
 Wanna run around the track while I run around it too 
 Wanna run run let me get that, split that 
 Run run run like me hit that rip that 
 Hit that rip that, get that go 
 Let me put in the pipe let me pack it in the bowl 
 Let me run run run run run run run 
 Like a motor bike racer running this show 
 I'll never really get upset all the way to the point 
 Where I feel like these no holding back now 
 Try to get a good outlet try to reroute 
 All the thoughts that's are weighing me down now 
 All it seems I need is a big bag of weed 
 And a couple shots of lets say crown 
 Few dope beats and I'm taking to jeep to a mt top out of town 
 That's where I go when I gotta go get out, 
 So I don't blow my top off and explode 
 'Cause when I lose control there's not enough time 
 For me to come back in piece body whole 
 I now that you know or at least I know that you relate 
 'Cause I've heard so many stories told gotta take a leap of faith 
 Put your song on your headphones and know that your not alone 
 When it feels like the sky is falling and the world is crumbling down 
 Listen deep inside your body clap clap clap clap clap that 
 The hands start spinnin' around 
 Everybody it's time clap that clap that clap that sound 
 Everybody it's time clap that clap that clap that sound 
 Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom away zoom zoom 
 Listen to the sound of the KMK 
 Web hit them with that boom clap sound 
 Weed in the bubbler, turn right round 
 Higher than the martians when I'm sparkin' 
 With a needle I'm Shontelle, just touched down now 
 Everybody stay rockin' out, all the potheads 
 From the college droppin' out stay rappin' truth 
 Need apple juice cause everybody on the track 
 Got Kottonmouth, we rock those speakers 
 Drop that ether, boom clap hit 'em with that 
 Onomatopoeia, breaking the chronic like the 
 Continents that made up Pangaea 
 A son of anarchy, constantly coppin' cannabis 
 A medical from a dispensary in Los Angeles 
 Can't handle this amateurs get devoured in 
 My sandwiches, I eat MCs for breakfast lunch and dinner 
 Got no manners kid Wayne and Garth in the building 
 I'm hear to get my party on, and get my Marley on cause 
 We burnin' like Rastafarians, everyday is Mardi Gras 
 So bitch show me your titties now, pass the piff around 
 Till we finish the whole frickin' pound 
 Kottonmouth and Webster droppin' it professional 
 So lifted off the ground that they think we're extraterrestrials 
 Hear that that be the sound of the police, on the way to ruin your time 
 Everybody in the area spark it up so they lose there minds 
 Boom clap fa shizzy I'm gonna keep these raps busy 
 I'm gonna keep my brain all dizzy, better get a map when you hear the boom clizzy
