Ah, yo 2000 
 Grand Imperial 
 New and improved 
 Show and prove 
 Yo, the underground rap veteran here to bring you 
 Cats the medicine to stop all the shit you've been peddlin 
 Ain't nothin' better when your pockets is phat 
 Niggas get up in the game and start changing they stacks 
 Without gats I can run in your spot 
 And take everything you got 
 Without bustin' a shot 
 Nothin' but the hotness 
 Nigga we got this 
 Your same old style is now soundin' monotenous 
 Close caption hold cats that's ready for action 
 I wouldn't give y'all the satisfaction 
 (Yo better get your crack or so 
 'Cause I can light to your ass when the track is old nigga) 
 I switch tones like I switch colognes 
 And keep it bangin' hard to your stereo headphones 
 It's Dick Swanson for the niggas that still ridin' the Johnson 
 Hate cats harder than Zack Bronson 
 I'm from the coast where they cary the toast 
 And puttin' clothes to your hair spittin' lyrics instead 
 Never in arrears ?? the cash 
 You being pushed out the block still coming in last 
 I let it blast so you niggas can feel 
 Fuck shady cats actin' like they cuttin' some deals 
 I tell you cats this I be swingin' the fish 
 You know the beats still bang and the lyrics is crisp 
 Ey yo 
 We spit it 
 You cats better get with it 
 Nothin' but cash man we stay fresh minted 
 If niggas is laid out then Rasco did it 
 Find me at the spot with the gunz still hot 
 I came to expose these mediore flows 
 Niggas who talk trash on weak ass shows 
 Niggas that ride dicks of weak ass clicks 
 Niggas that get smashed for being in the mix 
 I stand alone you clone your shit 
 You ponder recash that don't even know shit 
 Puttin' you out there to make 'em cash 
 Blame yourself when your career don't last 
 Outta your class vast amidst four tips with blue prints 
 Of books with some raw ass hooks 
 Never ran with crooks, I use my brain 
 Dissin' the rowl instead of dissin' cocaine 
 Tryin' to explain, your click ain't sick 
 I'm ready to smack y'all with forty five licks 
 Right to the teeth I spit heat to the street for real 
 Still lookin' for the cash and a deal 
 Who's fault is that?It sounds like yours 
 Nothin' but rhymes that come straight from the pause 
 Settle the score but don't spit in our clothes 
 I'm fittin' somewhere between the highs and the lows 
 Blowing back to those that shattered that glass 
 You know it's for real cause your sister sold by the glass 
 I tell you cats this I be swingin' the fish 
 You know the beats still bang and the lyrics is crisp 
 Ey yo 
 Ey check this 
 I ain't even begin I still blow a niggas plan turn water to sand 
 Every blade is plain I rain on a niggas parade 
 Throwin' grenades at his fresh cut dane 
 Every joint is made on rhymes from the spot 
 You fuckin' with us you better bring all you got 
 Ras came to rock for real MC's 
 And fuck keepin' it real, I need those G's 
 One hundred degrees I burn outta turn so learn 
 Don't but here when you got no concern 
 Niggas get smacked for doin' shit like that 
 I verbally blast and pull his whole wig back 
 Straight from the CA we ain't no kids 
 You better rethink that and raise that bid 
 You know what it is rush the bus like us 
 Living this plush plush the trust is a must 
 Ready to crush these young cats to the map 
 And how do I get mines to sound so phat 
 We take time I scrutinise every line 
 You spendin' my cash you better find every dime 
 One more time I spit lyrics like these 
 The soul by the glass rock shows overseas 
 I tell you cats this I be swingin' the fish 
 You know the beats still bang and the lyrics is crisp 
 Ey yo
