What? Ugh, what? Ugh 
 Yeah (ha ha) check it out 
 Are you a rapper or a criminal who's tired of livin' minimal 
 These labels wanna burn you, so a lotta rappers turn to 
 The streets, where mine don't eat, sheets, now beats 
 No record plays, back to the old days and old ways 
 To a hustle, back around like a belt buckle 
 Yo it's a struggle, for a dealer who can't shuffle 
 I throw the three up, plus I'm gon' be up 
 Hit my man on the hip, plus a nigga gotta re-up 
 No more bein sociable, goin' on promotional 
 Tours or in-stores, music floodin them seats indoors 
 Back on the block breakin laws 
 You was just up in the sky with the stars 
 Thinkin' about a Lexus, now you gettin' restless 
 Cut off from the guest list, now manifest this and test these 
 Waters, 'cause your per dium's ain't feedin niggas' sons and daughters 
 It'll make a thug harder, I'll know 
 (Kool DJ EQ scratching) 
 "You can't trust nobody" [x8] 
 Yeah 
 And fake friends with fake grins and fake skins 
 Wonder why you're one's ain't ten's, concerned with ends 
 It feel hectic, plus it's real hectic 
 How many entertainers went from hit records to jail records? 
 They thought their deal was their meal ticket (Yeah) 
 Went from a pack of double mint, to a single chicklet 
 I show 'n' tell, you never fall till you fell 
 And hurt yourself, over-exert yourself 
 You got to go and get the shovel and dig the dirt yourself 
 Learn how to work yourself, assert yourself 
 In this game of masturbation, you got to jerk yourself 
 And try to spread like Ebola, it's not always the real thing 
 Like Coca-Cola, a baby couldn't move without a push from his stroller 
 Too many turn to drugs, they can't deal with it sober 
 And it's a big chance that you ain't never gettin' over 
 But I don't know 
 "You can't trust nobody" [x8]
