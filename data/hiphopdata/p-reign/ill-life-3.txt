As the bubbles at the bottom glass shift to the top 
 I feel like them, wishing I could pop 
 They hopeing I would stop, drop, identify with the bottom but I recognize the top 
 And when you got nothing you could recognize alot so you grind till you shine by connecting all the dots. yeah 
 To lifes fabulous I can't stop, they aiming for my head still I'm riding in the drop 
 Like whatever doesn't kill me gotta make me stronger 
 Code name Canada, my country I've conquer and for this lonely country id give anything in return I've gained nothing and lost everything 
 And now its one thing I thought id never confess on so on this chessboard I need a reality check cause realitys left so now there's nothing but stress so in my world we keep a hundred gunnas on deck
