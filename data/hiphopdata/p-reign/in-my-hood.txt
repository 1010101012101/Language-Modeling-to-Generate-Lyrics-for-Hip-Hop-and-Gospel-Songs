It's the same things that we go through 
 I'm trying to show you 
 When you grow up in the hood 
 Wanna make it gotta be strong try to hold on 
 When you grow up in the hood 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up in the hood 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up in the hood... 
 It's the same place we try to move from 
 But if your real you never forget where you come from 
 We had to hustle from sun up to no sun 
 And our only job was to get the job done (job done) 
 As far as mamas go they kept us breathing 
 Cause most of us ain't never had fathers we believed in 
 And that church it was there for one reason 
 We all begged to God and it's the best place to meet him 
 The feds ain't never help us and we ain't never need em 
 They never seen potential so we only seen the precinct 
 Take me out the hood but the hood will never leave him 
 The only thing that change was the season believe me 
 It's the same thing that we go trough 
 I'm tryin' to show you when you grow up in the hood 
 Wanna make it gotta be strong try to hold on 
 When you grow up in the hood 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up in the hood 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up in the hood 
 Yeaaa I love my hood and I'm a ride for em 
 Thought me how to live so like big I'm ready to die for em 
 My baby boys like me so I'm trying show him 
 While he growing get knocked down you gotta keep going 
 I said it's cool if you break a few rules 
 Just beat the odds gotta win 'cause they expect you to lose 
 Education is a tool but it don't make you a fool (nah) 
 Became millionaires that ain't graduate school 
 I send it I dreamed it hoped that I would be it 
 Cause our mamas told us one day we'll make it if we believed it 
 We used to steal bikes just so we could pop a wheelie 
 Brand new 20s on the b.m like that's reign when they see me 
 I got everything I wanted from the hood strait to our TV 
 I got more than 3 wishes and I never met a genie 
 Paraplegic people they will never feel me (never) 
 I call them niggas stevie 'cause they will never see me 
 It's the same thing that we go trough 
 I'm tryin' to show you when you grow up in the hood 
 Wanna make it gotta be strong try to hold on 
 When you grow up in the hood 
 We grew up to early worried bout survival 
 The dealers had the money so the dope boys where our idols 
 Living in the projects there's always something to do 
 How do we stay out of trouble we struggle is all we do 
 We all had dreams and stories to tell friends that past away 
 Or family in the jails the sky is the limit had to learn to grow wings 
 And I ain't gotta say it listen to the hook sing 
 It's the same thing that we go trough 
 I'm tryin' to show you when you grow up in the hood 
 Wanna make it gotta be strong try to hold on 
 When you grow up in the hood 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up in the hood 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up (in the hood) 
 When you grow up in the hood...
