Yea I'm getting money 
 You know why we stay so fly 
 Lay back in the middle 
 While I'm doing my thang 
 Yea I'm getting money 
 You see when I'm flying threw 
 Caddy's midnight black 
 Wrist alligator green 
 Chain ocean blue 
 Honey - in black what you wanna do 
 You say you got money this how you suppose to do 
 I grind cause I have to 
 Not cause I want to 
 This brother knows what he wants 
 And he wants you 
 The woman call me a g and it's so true 
 But I was raised like this it ain't my fault boo 
 I'm from a hood where you have to go get it 
 You never know where you go so you gotta get it 
 Now lets lighten up the car 
 When I said I was a star I meant it 
 You see's how daddy do ya you never wanna leave 
 You get a chest cold from my chain and I freeze ya 
 Money in the bank from Halloween to Easter 
 Forget about yoYour man tell him you have amnesia 
 Yea I'm getting money 
 You know why we stay so fly 
 Lay back in the middle 
 While I'm doing my thang 
 Yea I'm getting money 
 They see me in the streets blow smoke out the roof 
 New coupe got it in my ear called bluetooth 
 Dying for my help don't be shy 
 YoYour lying to Yourself you know you wanna ride 
 Stick him n just get by 
 Come with me n come get fly 
 Are you gotta worry about is louis, gouache, gucci armoni, product on ya body 
 These other dudes will go broke tryna copy 
 The feds can't keep up tryna watch me 
 So how the hell are they gonna stop me 
 I'm the block fit the hustle kid knock it 
 Bank row fishers you never lose an option 
 ???? tremendous you never tell him stop it 
 Ride with Your boy Your fy up in the cock pit 
 Yea I'm getting money 
 You know why we stay so fly 
 Lay back in the middle 
 While I'm doing my thang 
 Yea I'm getting money 
 Don't ever disrespect the king I'm a fetch 
 Doing like a check board I'm putting in check 
 ?? vest 
 Look at my neck..lace 
 Now that's a different part of the body Your blessed with
