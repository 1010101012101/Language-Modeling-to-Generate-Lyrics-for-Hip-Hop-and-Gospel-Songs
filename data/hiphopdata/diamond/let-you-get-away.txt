Dis you anthem now baby 
 Get used to it 
 'Cause it's real fucked up 
 How could I let you get away 
 (Dis you shit you now gone be sanging dis every time you see me 
 Every time you hear about me you feel me 
 You gone be like damn) 
 I must admit I'm kinda glad that you came into my life 
 Cause every since you've been apart of it I've lived a anothert lie 
 Ain't wanna do right 
 You had me thinkin' that you really gave a fuck 
 But ended up being like the other noggas that I fucked 
 But because of that I never stressed 
 I'm just kickin up the dust 
 Take my heart and lock it up 
 And throw the keys away for us 
 It ain't nothin' to discuss 
 Don't talk about a situation 
 You been cheatin' livin' life without a whole conversation 
 When I talked to the chick myself 
 She told me how you really felt 
 Man I told you all my business and you go tell someone else 
 You can go to hell and melt, melt 
 For all I give a shit 
 See me all up on the TV while you chillen with dat bitch 
 (Diamond talikin: while chorus playin') 
 You see dai song right here 
 Iis not just for you baby 
 It's for all my females that done every been through somethin' with a nuttin ass nigga 
 So if you guilty of dis shit 
 And you hear dis song and it make you mad 
 Dat mean you need to get you shit together 
 I love it's my favorite song on the god damn shit 
 It's the realest shit 
 For all my ladies I know y'all feel me 
 I'm just gone ride dis bitch on out feel me 
 I don't even gotta rap no mo 
 I don't even gotta talk no mo I'm out
