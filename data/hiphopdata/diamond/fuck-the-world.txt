I been on this earth so long I knew that it would come to this 
 Ain't nobody gave a fuck so tell me why should I give a shit 
 'Cause dis bitches ain't shit 
 And these nighas ain't real 
 I'm screaming fuck the world unitl the grave and that's just how I feel 
 On the real 
 My partna got killed he paid the price 
 Why dem nighas take the road I chose 
 It ain't safe when I'm in my showhis life 
 Ain't nobody living right 
 That's why I'm prayin' every nigh 
 That I stay upon my toes 
 'Cause I know s shit 
 And I stay buckin like it's nothin' to my last breath 
 My cousin 
 Yeah dey say she on that crystal meth 
 I blame myself 
 'Cause if I wasn't rapping she would be with me 
 And not that nigha that be trappin gone off of that weed 
 I really miss my seed I hate that I miscarriaged ya 
 Just know that mommmy loves ya always thinkin' of ya 
 Put no one above ya 
 Ain't no other way to put it 
 Fuck the world sincerly yours and that's just how I'm feeling 
 Now I'm the main bread winnner in my family that's why I gotta get it till it ain't no single breath in me 
 Been running things 
 Since I was 16 
 Why da devil keep on testin streesin me 
 And I know I betta c 
 My papi make it to eighty I get tired of going to grady for the bucks to say ay skay man ya daddy may not make it I can't take dis shit 
 So tell me what about my brothers 
 Whos gonna raise my younger brother 
 I need sum fuckin' order 
 I'm da youngest fukin daughter 
 I need a glass of water I'm bout 2 pass out 
 If dat nigha keep hurtin' my sister I'm a fuckin' smash out just ride out on his stupid fuckin' coward ass 
 Ask my manger bail me out once I whip dis niggy ass 
 Sometimes I wish the plane I'm on crashes and burn to ashes 
 Just so I could see a reaction 
 Who really givesa fuck about me 
 Nobody shawty 
 That's why I'm screamin fuck the world until I die 
 How 'bout it (how 'bout it)
