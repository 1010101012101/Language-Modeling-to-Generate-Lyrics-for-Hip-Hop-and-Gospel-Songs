 They say I'm a role model, but not a good leader 
 'Cause I be chief in reefer, sitting in my two-seater 
 Bust dat desert eagle, spit it like my last breath 
 Put my music on the shelf; let the fans do the rest 
 I'm a role model, but not a good leader 
 'Cause I be chief in reefer, sitting in my two-seater 
 Bust dat desert eagle, spit it like my last breath 
 Put my music on the shelf; let the fans do the rest 
 Since I'm not a role model, let's just state the facts 
 I've been writing rhymes, spitting bars up on these tracks 
 Push them haters up off my back 
 Smoking kush and purple thrats 
 'Cause that shit helps me relax 
 Plus with all that other crap 
 Let's just say it ease the pain, 'cause I'm just going insane 
 I can't live without it shawty, it's a part of the game 
 I found myself on the road to success 
 And that I want be no one else 
 I am the one... 
 I owe it all to myself 
 Been hurting... too death 
 That's why I spit for myself 
 And put this shit on the shelf 
 Because I'm part of my grind 
 I do this shit all the time 
 It ain't a thang about me perfect 
 Bold and underline 
 They say I'm a role model, but not a good leader 
 'Cause I be chief in reefer, sitting in my two-seater 
 Bust dat desert eagle, spit it like my last breath 
 Put my music on the shelf; let the fans do the rest 
 I'm a role model, but not a good leader 
 'Cause I be chief in reefer, sitting in my two-seater 
 Bust dat desert eagle, spit it like my last breath 
 Put my music on the shelf; let the fans do the rest 
 Been in some situations 
 I've had some confrontations 
 They didn't wanna solve em, but made some false allegations 
 I am the motivation 
 I mean the motivator 
 I'll see you haters later 
 'Cause I am getting paper 
 So for yo information 
 And all yo conversations 
 I hear you cha-cha-chatter 
 Whisper dat away 
 'Cause diamonds on another page 
 And probably be up on yo stage or in yo damn arena 
 Rollin' out up in the beamer 
 You can catch the middle finger 
 And for that matter, I run that spatter in yo bones 
 I will shatter with the lyrics of disaster 
 I can make you call yo pastor 
 If you scared then go to church 
 Live yo life, I'm living mine 
 It ain't a thang about my perfect 
 Bold and underline 
 They say I'm a role model, but not a good leader 
 'Cause I be chief in reefer, sitting in my two-seater 
 Bust dat desert eagle, spit it like my last breath 
 Put my music on the shelf; let the fans do the rest 
 I'm a role model, but not a good leader 
 'Cause I be chief in reefer, sitting in my two-seater 
 Bust dat desert eagle, spit it like my last breath 
 Put my music on the shelf; let the fans do the rest

 When you look at me you'll see I'm not perfect 
 When you look at me you'll see I'm just learning 
 Tryna be my best, keep niggas off my chest 
 Don't you look at me, just look at TV 
 When you look at me you'll see I'm not perfect 
 When you look at me you'll see I'm just learning 
 Tryna be my best, keep niggas off my chest 
 Don't you look at me, just look at TV
