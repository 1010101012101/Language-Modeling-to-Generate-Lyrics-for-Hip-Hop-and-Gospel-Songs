What the fuck's up! 
 DTP in this mother fucker 
 And for all y'all that don't like it 
 Do one thing, get the fuck back 
 Cause all my niggas is ready 
 Luda, 20, Fate, Shawna 
 Let's show these motherfuckers how we disturb the peace 
 Get the fuck back, bitch 
 Fuck That! 
 Get the fuck back! 
 Luda make your skull crack 
 Tuck that 
 Bitch, your whole town's on my nut-sack 
 Cuff that 
 Put it in your weed, nigga, puff that 
 What's that 
 People goin' die tonight 
 Bronson, motherfucker, give me more than three feet 
 DTP in the club, we comin' more than three deep 
 Your whole crew is weak and my squad is real cash getters 
 Stayin' more to crunk, our shit bump like bad clippers 
 How many try to hustle with Dealer then went broke 
 Infamous, I'm a value meal, I come with the coke 
 I gotta enough guns for beef, if you want it that way 
 I'll push your wig back like finger waves or bad toupee 
 (Ludacris) 
 I lick a load of you niggas, leave kids in the hallways 
 Catch 'em at they locker (hoo-ah, blocka blocka) (gun shots) 
 See 'em on Broadway and tap they ass 
 Catch 'em in the swimming pool and overlap they ass 
 (Fate) 
 I'm from the southside, College Park 
 G Road, niggas gone 
 Ride when the beef starts 
 Don't hold back, let the heat spark 
 One's through his vest, one's through his chest 
 Sleepy hollows put the niggas to rest, uh 
 What you know about projects, hoes, and murder 
 Whole lotta game, whole lotta keys and burners 
 Whole lotta dope fiends, trying to scheme the workers 
 Whole lotta feds, got them niggas scared to surface 
 Type of bitch that got the brown in my sock 
 Find me on the block tryin' to cop a piece of the crop 
 Watch me, pull up on me real sweet in a drop 
 But if you fuckin' with my paper, feel the heat from the glock, nigga 
 (Ludacris) 
 We pop bottles, bottles, 
 Right over you head, niggas 
 Put nozzles, nozzles 
 Right over your leg, niggas 
 Our motto, motto 
 Is kill 'em instead, niggas 
 We make 'em loose weight, when we Jenny Craig, niggas 
 (i-20) 
 All of y'all is half nice, half thugs, and half assed 
 The only time I'm goin' half, is half on a half 
 But I use a full clip, 'cause I'm a full fledged killer 
 Part-time MC, full-time drug dealer 
 We the filthy niggas from the South, A-Town represent us 
 Strong arming motherfuckers, like a Russian sickle 
 You got issues with us talkin' shit on mixed tapes 
 Ill catch you at a show and beat you with a mix tape 
 You best pump brakes, 'fore I pump shells and blood ooze 
 I leave niggas like burps (burp), excuse 
 Just keep on pissing me off, like a week kidney 
 And you will find your family reading your obituary 
 (Ludacris) 
 These people tryin' to scrub the red off 
 Stains they don't get off 
 They wanted to bring the pain, so this thing 'bout to set off 
 Barretas for getting cheddar, you're better off dead off 
 Yes, you can do it, cut his fucking head off 
 (Shawna) 
 I got a letter from the government, the other day 
 They told me that the bitches caught a shipment of my yay 
 They on their way, three minutes to get the K 
 Two minutes to get the weight, one minute and I'ma spray 
 (Repeat: x2) 
 Bang bang kill a man let his brains hang 
 And when I'm in the court, plead guilty insane 
 They put me in a ward, I'ma have to maintain 
 But when I hit bricks won't a damn thing change
