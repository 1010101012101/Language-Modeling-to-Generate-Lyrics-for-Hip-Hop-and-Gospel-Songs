...I be that bitch in that all black tinted out el dorado 
 Ain't nobody fuckin' wit me 
 It's my chicago 
 When you see me in the club mean-mug your bottle 
 That's that remy to your face kid gully soprano 
 Ain't nobody fuckin' with the weed like I do 
 And I'm probably sippin' remy and that hypno too 
 And I'm kinda tired of hearin' what this bitch gon' do 
 'Cause if she poppin' with her fam 
 They can get some too 
 I know you heard about them bitches from the gold and the gutta 
 Fuck a sack chaser 
 Mami got that dro' and that butta' 
 Papi hit me for the low 
 I'm out in philly wit' tutter 
 Where the sticky be so fine 
 Make you talk wit' a studda' 
 Like pusha 
 Pusha please can I get one mo' 
 It's four niggas in the breeze 
 Standin' at my door 
 I'm like one 
 Two 
 Three 
 Reachin' at my four 
 'Cause if I sque-sque-squeeze 
 Nigga that's how it go... that's all we got fo' that one...
