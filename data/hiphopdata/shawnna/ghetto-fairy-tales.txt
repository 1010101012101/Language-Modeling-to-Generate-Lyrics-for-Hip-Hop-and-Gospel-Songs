(Whisperin: x4) 
 These are my ghetto fairytales... 
 These are my ghetto fairytales 
 Sit back and just listen to what I'm spittin' 'cause I'm cold 
 I'm straight reminiscing on all my niggas dead and gone 
 See when I was young I was just so dumb and didn't know 
 How quickly the reaper would come and creap up for your soul 
 I play with them niggas that like to live it by the chase 
 They told me whatever you do just keep your body safe 
 Pitbull in the front and my German shepard by the gates 
 Blowing booze and [? ] to keep my body out of space 
 And I heard bout my nigga they send up to their face 
 And they sayin' it's probable when the feds investigate 
 Gotta do what I gotta do while they take my nigga away 
 Promised you my protection I gotta make a nigga pay 
 Bustin' in the direction of any mothafucka fake 
 I burn a nigga to [? ] presidents up in this place 
 Now they tell me I'm too ghetto for this shit 
 I feel like I'm the only rebel in this shit 
 [X2:] These are my ghetto fairytales 
 These are the tales, my ghetto tales 
 These are the tales, that I tell so well 
 Northside, Eastside, Westside, Southside 
 [Many times:] These are my ghetto fairytales...
