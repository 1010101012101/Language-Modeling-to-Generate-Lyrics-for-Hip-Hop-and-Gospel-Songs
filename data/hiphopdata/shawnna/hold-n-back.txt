Intro (Shawnna) 
 Why you treat me like you do? 
 Can it just be me and you? 
 'Cause I don't wanna play no more 
 If I let go, you let go 
 'Cause I just can't get enough 
 And I just wanna feel you touch 
 But I just gotta know whatsup, wutsup, wutsup 
 Verse 1 (Marques Houston) 
 Hey girl come here sit down 
 Lemme holla at you a while 
 Gotta get this off my chest 
 Hope that you can handle it 
 We've been seeing each other a lot 
 Honestly I don't want it to stop 
 You and me; Me and you 
 I'm liking what we've got 
 Only thing that's bothering me 
 We ain't as close as we should be 
 That's cause your holding back 
 Holding back your love for me 
 How do you expect to grow if you just don't let go 
 Chorus (Marques Houston) 
 Why you tryna hold back 
 Why you tryna hold back 
 When you know you want it just like I do 
 Why you acting like that, girl don't do me like that 
 All I'm tryna do is be next to you 
 Why you tryna hold back 
 Why you tryna hold back on me baby 
 All I want is you stop holdin' back on me 
 Verse 2 (Mya) 
 Don't take offense to this 
 Not tryna start no mess 
 Ain't tryna have you stressed 
 This is just a little test 
 I wanna see how serious 
 Serious you are of us 
 Do you like or like me not 
 I'm loving what we've got 
 Only thing that bothers me 
 We ain't close as we should be 
 That's cause your holding back 
 Holding back you love for me 
 How do expect this thing to grow 
 If you don't let it go go go go 
 Chorus (Mya and Marques Houston) 
 Babe 
 Why you tryna hold back 
 Why you tryna hold back 
 When you know you want it just like I do 
 Why you acting like that, girl don't do me like that 
 All I'm tryna do is be next to you 
 Why you tryna hold back 
 Why you tryna hold back on me baby 
 All I want is you stop holdin' back on me 
 Verse 3 (Shawnna) 
 Everytime I get to thinking 'bout you 
 I see I can't be without you 
 Cause you that shit, that's it 
 And I really can't leave right now boo 
 You my fix, your kiss 
 Made me bout to let go bout to 
 But wait right quick can't slip 
 I don't really think your down with this 
 See I played these games before 
 And I fall every time we go 
 Cause see I can't no more 
 I move slow but don't really wanna stop the flow 
 Don't know what to do 
 Gotta just relax and hold back 
 Just sit back and roll that, roll that, rolle that 
 Chorus (Mya and Marques Houston) 
 Babe 
 Why you tryna hold back 
 Why you tryna hold back 
 When you know you want it just like I do 
 Wht you acting like that, girl don't do me like that 
 All I'm tryna do is be next to you 
 Why you tryna hold back 
 Why you tryna hold back on me baby 
 All I want is you stop holding back on me 
 Outro (Shawnna) 
 Why you treat me like you do? 
 Can it just be me and you? 
 'Cause I just can't get enough 
 And I just wanna feel you touch 
 Wutsup wutsup 
 Why you treat me like you do? 
 Can it just be me and you? 
 'Cause I just can't get enough 
 And I just wanna feel you touch 
 I just gotta know whatsup, wutsup, wutsup
