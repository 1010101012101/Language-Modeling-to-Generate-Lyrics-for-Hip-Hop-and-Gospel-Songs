Chorus - Ludacris & (Shawnna)) 
 Maannn, these women is awfully nasty 
 And these women keep walking past me 
 Either way, I'm a pimp for today 
 Put your booty in the way and shake that... 
 (Now these playaz is bout they bank) 
 (And these playaz keep buying dranks) 
 (Lips creep from my body on your lips) 
 (Get it closer to the tip and shake that...) 
 (Verse 1 - Shawnna) 
 S-H-A to the W double N-A 
 Real ----- don't play 
 Your eyes can't hide what your lips won't say 
 You're acting like the Dukes of the... won't ... 
 It's okay, they gon learn 
 Chi's most wanted, ----- wait your turn! 
 ...Full of yum I'm a make that burn 
 Y'all can't smoke none anyway 
 Wild ones, walk wit a ----- through wild slums 
 Trying to figure out if they're scared of the hips or the chips 
 Or they really can't talk to a ----- wit wild ---- 
 No games, hat to the side wit low frame 
 Now I came in this industry killin' em 
 Now they all feeling me, sipping on Henny wit an O and a gram! 
 (Verse 2 - Shawnna) 
 M-I-D to the W-E-S-T 
 Better yet that's me 
 Most of y'all chicks gotta impress me 
 You say you got skills, put 'em up let's see 
 Show and prove, I hate to really see 
 What y'all goin' through, put on any beat 
 We could spit it in the street 
 From the West to the East, or South to the house 
 Just showing love, go home 
 The body on the flo' is so grown 
 What cha gon' do, when you call to ya label 
 And ya gotta shed a tear, cause you hear ya career's 
 Been post-poned, back up 
 Smart mouth ------ get slapped up 
 Take it to the trap, get... up 
 Put it in ya brain that the female game, been wrapped up 
 (Outro - Shawnna) 
 Shorty said, shorty said 
 Shorty said, shorty said 
 Wait a minute, hold up 
 Wait a minute, hold up 
 Hold up, wait a minute 
 Hold up, now wait a minute 
 Shorty said, shorty said 
 Shorty said, shorty said
