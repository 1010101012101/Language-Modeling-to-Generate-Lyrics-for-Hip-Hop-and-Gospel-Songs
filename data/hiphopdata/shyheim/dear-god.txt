Dear god, I wonder can you save me? 
 I'm workin out in this world that you made g 
 Homicide rapes and robberies 
 When it happens in my neighborhood police they look for me 
 I'm the prime suspect in the projects 
 I got this fucked up rep that keeps me behind a step 
 Always broke so I got this attitude 
 In my lab never fool my man, this is crazy rude 
 Gyros and pizza, be my lunch and dinner 
 I know that I'm a sinner, but God help me out nigga 
 I got problems that only death could solve 
 A high school drop out, and my ged won't get me no job 
 My family be callin me a loser 
 Moms she's a boozer, got me livin' life with no future 
 The only thing that keeps me strivin is rhymin and uh 
 Bump 'n' grindin besides that I feel like dying 
 Word to my peoples in the essence 
 I send my blessings 
 I know you gone, but it might be for the best 
 'Cause life is full of stress 
 And the projects you won't progress 
 God, fuck the world, it's a mess 
 Chorus: pop da brown hornet 
 Dear, god, as I look into the sky 
 I pray to you, and i, wonder why 
 I wonder why things be the way they are 
 So until then I pray for that it ends tomorr 
 Verse two: shyheim 
 I'm in another world lookin' from the outside in 
 A corrupt planet, operating strictly off sin 
 You ask me will I miss this joint when I pass 
 The world can kiss my ass, I'm staring at the hour glass 
 Every day lived, is a step towards death 
 It's not till you're dead that your bodies at rest 
 A funeral should be a celebration, everyone embracin 
 This song'll be my dedication, unto 
 The two cent s, my cousin duana, and case 
 Rest in peace no one can ever take your place 
 The pain is eternal 
 No one to turn to when I sit and think about you 
 No longer in the physical, dealing with your spiritual essence 
 You're gone but we still feel your presence 
 Nothing can bring you back, black 
 Still and all it's just a fact that you gone 
 Dive I intox on the bar, a dagger in the heart 
 For every lifeforce that gets a brand new start 
 It's the harsh reality you're forced to deal with 
 Another family hit crawling in a endless pit 
 Of sorrow, no one's promised tomorrow 
 Verse three: shyheim 
 (It seems like the good times vs the bad times) 
 Yo I barely go to school 'cause crime be on my mind 
 Fuck local hits to leakers that's all in the past 
 And I'm livin' for the future gotta make the great cash 
 (Slow down shorty, goodness come to those that wait 
 If you move too fast I might be going to your wake) 
 True indeed, but I got mouths to feed 
 Members of my family upstate in need for commisary 
 And if you stressin me, gettin' the, best of me 
 So it seems like life is my worst enemy 
 (Don't let it get to you, shy 
 Life is what you make it, you can't escape it 
 Play you like a bitch and just take it) 
 Hell no, 'cause when I'm goin', I'm goin' out with style 
 With two macs going to war with the other side of town 
 Ain't nuttin sweet about me, pop let them niggaz know 
 I'm countin' blood money, 'cause I'm a thug honey 
 I use the world as my zoo, I ain't no fuckin' dummy 
 I'm street smart, I tear a college grad apart 
 (I gets amped when I think about the slave camps 
 I feel the pain, use a tec-9 to brake away the chain) 
 Yo calm down big fella everything gonna be aight 
 Go lookin' for them blues you got a nigga wanna do right 
 (Don't sweat it, just play the game of life at your best 
 Life is full of stress and in the projects you won't progress 
 Shy fuck the world it's a mess) 
 Yeah aight
