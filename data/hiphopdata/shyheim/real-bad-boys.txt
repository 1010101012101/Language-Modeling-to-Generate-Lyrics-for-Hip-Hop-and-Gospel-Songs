 Verse One: Shyheim 
 I stash butterflie knives and 45's in ma garments 
 Fuck nigga, I take a pussy god quick 
 Peep ma stee in the streets where respected 
 Like the rectomatic dime back to the Method, Zee 
 Bomb on heads like what kid 
 I keep 'em on slow mo son I'm the champion at one on one 
 I make it death fun when I killed ya 
 I take a power driller and drill it right through ya liver 
 Ha, Ha, Ha, 
 I'm ruthless possesed by the devil 
 Fuck fire part I'm on a hole nother level 
 Tha mess tablets make ya mind flick 
 Ma murdarous styles, I kid make female groupies lickin' ya dick 
 Word to ma mother I put this on tour wicked 
 The first that fakin' I relacin'ma dislocatin' 
 Real niggaz do real things youknowhatImean? 
 The first that fake the game so Lincoln thrown in the fiend

 Favourite song
