Nowadays you gotsta walk the street and watch your back 
 Cause brothers with the gats don't be knowin' how to act 
 They always pull the glock when somebody rocks they knot 
 And if they get shot they often snitch to the cops 
 Now tell me this ain't livin' foul 
 She just had a baby child and she's back to sellin crack vials 
 On the Ave 'cause she's addicted to the fast cash 
 How long will that last before the cops be up in that ass 
 But honey-dip don't wanna listen 'cause she's in no position 
 Now nobody gives a pot to piss in 
 Her life is stuck and filled with bad luck 
 So she fucks and fucks to earn another buck 
 She don't really care about pride 
 And she jumps into another ride then committed suicide 
 Hey Yo, this goes on it don't stop 
 Everybody's doin' their own thing 
 From hooker in the drug slang (repeat 2) 
 Times is gettin' hard, word is bond, I swear to God 
 I even got caught tryin' to steal from the junkyard 
 A born terror, A rebel without a cause 
 Ain't never had a good Christmas, so who is Santa Claus? 
 I walk the streets at night with my head down 
 In this lil town you see clowns that wanna be down 
 So they get a glock a lick shots to get props 
 And when shit rocks all you can hear is the shells drop 
 An old man got shot in the parkin' lot 
 In front of my buildin' I hang with his grandchildren 
 And for the nigga that pulled the trigga and tried to slide 
 And hide, but he got knocked by da homicide 
 And this happens everyday around my way 
 So I pray that I can live anotha day 
 Hey Yo, get a load of this guy you know the Mr. Hard 
 He the one who talk about gats but ain't bustin' nobody 
 He speaks the name game so he can just maintain 
 I'll blow him out the frame 'n' his moms'll get gang banged 
 But his rep was hi-tech in the projects 
 Pulled his nuckle-jacks so he got mad respect 
 The niggaz in hoodiez packed up their loaded gats 
 Met up in the back so they could plan the attack 
 Wasn't hard to tell that these kids was no joke 
 They let the pistol smoke and at nine was dopin and coked 
 I seen it happen everyday where I live 
 I know a few brothers, drug dealers, most of them fugitives 
 (Repeat till fade)
