Ha, and it don't stop and it don't stop 
 Rugged child got the world prop nigga 
 Can you feel it 
 Can you feel it 
 (Do I gotta cock my pistol?) 
 (Shyheim) 
 I be notorious like that nigga big smalls 
 Plus I keep it raw live illegal like jamal 
 If ya act up you get shot up 
 What the blood? I represent thugs (you know it) 
 Y'all know my style, bring it to man, woman and child 
 Buckwild juvenile (rugged child break it down) 
 Jiggers they stick close like crews 
 You never see me spendin cash rules on you fools 
 'Cause I don't love you hoes (why not) 
 A lot of y'all cross be laws like got 
 A nigga like me keep it real, word to Jesus 
 Respect to the real woman, fuck you skeezers 
 Can you feel it 
 Can you feel it 
 (Or do I gotta cock my pistol?) 
 I'm a juvenile deliquent, I keeps a cocked biscuit 
 Moet and alize be gettin' a nigga lifted 
 And when I'm high my mouth is dry 
 I'm not from the sky 
 But a nigga for the eye he better do or die 
 Clack-clack, that's all you hear up in the dark 
 Blaka-blaka, and then two bright sparks 
 The boy fall down while screamin police 
 Woo jiggy comin', but them no worry me see 
 A criminal for bein crimi-nal 
 No matter who, what, how, when or where it goes down 
 A dramalord plus a punany don 
 In '95 I'ma max like nissan 
 I'ma max, get it, max, I'ma, max-ima, well come along 
 I take you through another chamber, let me pick 
 36 wu-tang? yeah that be that shit 
 So I creep ooh I roll deep like f.o.i.'s 
 Recognize or get paralyzed 
 I drop jewels like a nervous appraiser 
 A hell raiser, engrave my logo in your back player 
 I bring the pain in many different methods 
 Similar to the lethal injection and your style is seconds 
 What punk, boy I'll box ya up 
 Plus my rhymes is sicker than them kids in somalia
