Phone rings twice* 
 Hello? 
 (Arabic voice) You have a collect call phone call 
 In a New York state correctional facility 
 Press five five to accept, or hang up to decline 
 Verse One: 
 Whattup gangstas, how tha fuck y'all feel 
 We keepin' it real, and hold on tight to your steel 
 Let them caps peel, one by one 
 And laugh while the nig run 
 He shoulda been packin his gun, now he gone 
 'Cause he got slippin like an old bitch 
 In the wet staircase shaft, now watch his man snitch 
 To tha police, but them no worry me son 
 I ain't trying to get back it'd be my third felony 
 Pataki he want to see us, criminals fry 
 In the electric chair, but my spirit will never die 
 A true project nigga, I won't hesitate 
 To pull the BLAOW, peace to all busy niggaz 
 One love y'all stay safe 
 And fuck you, Officer Brown, peace to that nigga Case 
 Chorus: repeat 4X 
 WhOO WhOO 
 Jiggy comin', fuck tha police y'all, 'cause I ain't runnin' 
 Verse Two: 
 All y'all police can suck my diiiiiiick 
 And Mayor Gulliani, that cracker boy full of shit 
 I represent, for all my niggaz doing time 
 And those who got beat up and killed by the swine 
 Beo-tches, them porks, beotch 
 Them think them bad, 'cause they carry, glocks and badges 
 And when I'm pimpin' in my green Acura 
 They pull me over, like I stole it from some nigga 
 But all my paperwork is legit 
 Registered insured in my name, so y'all pigs can shit 
 Police be cockin me like I'm some dime piece 
 A G from the street so I can never turn beast 
 Verse Three: 
 There's crooked cops, that's why they get shot by tha minute 
 If you were criminal and you ready to represent, kid 
 Blaow, that's how I like it, word is bond 
 My hair ain't blonde my eyes ain't blue so now I'm dead boo 
 It's on like this is war, all my brothers in the hood 
 I gots fam that's constant understand I wish they would 
 But it's all good, peace to my niggaz locked in jail 
 Bushy Kam, Killa Kane, Fogey Foo, and Ale 
 Down Low Wrecka and Junior be on storm 
 Keep your headz up, and keep it real 'cause you know I'm gonna 
 And for my niggaz doin' six months 
 I see yo ass next summer, word up
