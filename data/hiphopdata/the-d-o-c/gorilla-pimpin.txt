(Verse 1: The D.O.C.) 
 Big baller, of blind diggy 
 Black foe dipply 
 Quickly, run into your city like Jeepsy 
 I kept a half of ounce 
 And I'm rude to get the cash and bounce 
 51 mansion, I ain't stopped, see what doin' the asking 
 All these player haters doin' this blasting 
 So while these fools words be heated like fashion 
 I'm gon' cash-in, what, I'm workin' with a full grip 
 Ain't no featurin' that bullshit, so I'll pull shit 
 Out like a presidential 
 Sleek and stay illegal like the governmental 
 Fake is backache, all the time 
 Got my shit lookin' bright like a shoes shine 
 Rub you off like massage when I'm on the grind 
 'Cause in my mind 
 You better get yours, 'cause I'ma get mine, fool... 
 (Chorus: Dr. Dre) 
 Stackin' them bricks got you trippin' 
 Them bricks and them cakes got you slippin' 
 A flock of birds got you on the yard sippin' 
 Or gettin' cheese in pay, all day, Gorilla Pympin' 
 Stackin' them bricks got you trippin' 
 Them bricks and them cakes got you slippin' 
 A flock of birds got you on the yard sippin' 
 Or maybe gettin' paid, all day, Gorilla Pympin' 
 (Verse 2: The D.O.C.) 
 Now I'ma drop into it right quick, G shit 
 You finna get the convict, subliminal bomb shit 
 Criminal, monoply, philosophy 
 Mean dollar properties, cheese overseas, status 
 Peep my macks are my apparatus 
 Known for my gift the Grammer 
 From Atlanta to Atlantis, I handle this, pound for pound 
 Brought you the scandalous, break it down 
 I'm gonna give you what you need 
 Full balls, big dick and straight weed 
 Or get wet up fool you better get up 
 And get yours from the D.O.P, fuckin' with me 
 Smooth Jackson, Bro Bax and Kool Max 
 On criminal contacts be lovin' my platinum plaques 
 But that ain't who I'ma goes at 
 On the real, dollar bills mothafucker, can you afford that... 
 (Chorus: Dr. Dre) 
 Stackin' them bricks got you trippin' 
 Them bricks and them cakes got you slippin' 
 A flock of birds got you on the yard sippin' 
 Or gettin' cheese in pay, all day, Gorilla Pympin' 
 Stackin' them bricks got you trippin' 
 Them bricks and them cakes got you slippin' 
 A flock of birds got you on the yard sippin' 
 Or maybe gettin' paid, all day, Gorilla Pympin' 
 (Break: Dr. Dre) 
 It's goin' on and on nigga 
 It's goin' on and on and on 
 It's goin' on and on my nigga 
 It's goin' on and on and on 
 It's goin' on and on nigga 
 It's goin' on and on and on 
 It's goin' on and on my nigga 
 G's goin' on and on and on 
 (Verse 3: Six Two) 
 Knick Knack Patty Wack, give the dog a bone 
 Now give him a chicken till my nigga is on 
 It don't stop, until your life get popped 
 And you can send them viberatin' when you dropped 
 Hot jam, better then the rest of them 
 I'm, therefore 
 I pack a flour when I'm on my tour 
 If we can make it though, niggaz actin' hardcore 
 It ain't the coast though, nigga it's the cash flow 
 Order ass-holes, for sheezy best believe me 
 Ain't no tellin' where my G's be 
 Nationality, reality niggaz salary or locality 
 Uh the grand finale, on my way back from Cali' 
 Fuckin' twin bitches, and they grins for they ends 
 And it's on nigga, rocks slangin' to you like the dirty cop 
 Clock till the world stopped, make them all dropped 
 My nigga Doc' empty out the whole box 
 I set it off, come on, come out get yours 
 Talkin' about your old black clothes 
 Caddillac doors, money from bad hoes 
 You know that's how Gorilla Pympin' goes 
 Realize that you gotta get yours 
 All dimes, all the time 
 You better get yours, 'cause I'ma get mine, fool... 
 (Chorus: Dr. Dre) 
 Stackin' them bricks got you trippin' 
 Them bricks and them cakes got you slippin' 
 A flock of birds got you on the yard sippin' 
 Or gettin' cheese in hate, all day, Gorilla Pympin' 
 Stackin' them bricks got you trippin' 
 Them bricks and them cakes got you slippin' 
 A flock of birds got you on the yard sippin' 
 Or maybe gettin' paid, all day, Gorilla Pympin' 
 (Outro: Six Two talking) 
 Nigga the world's on your hand 
 You got game, nigga learnt know how to gain
