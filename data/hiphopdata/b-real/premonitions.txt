B-Real - Premonitions 
 I got mad visions, pictures and premonitions 
 Of war drums and suicide missions 
 Prosecution, execution, revolution, mass confusion 
 All over ready for war, I'm a soldier 
 Nightmares of crosshairs, concentration camps 
 And electric chairs marking you with the stamp 
 Prepare yourself 
 Am I paranoid? why in my dreams, have I seen 
 The whole world destroyed? 
 Civilization raped, ain't no escape 
 Situations escalate in the date of 2000 
 Ya want revelation, or is it just my imagination? 
 Invasion dreams reoccurring 
 I can't explain it 
 But it's the same one everyday 
 Televisions trackers citizens massacres 
 And cashless systems 
 The new order with no border renegades 
 The rule over the new age Malaise 
 Picture the grey haze consuming the world 
 This dream never goes away 
 I wish I knew the meaning of all this 
 'Cause the pieces of the puzzle just don't fit 
 Premonitions of war cloud my every thought 
 Battles fought, won and lost a holocaust 
 Always the same ending, don't ever change 
 But I refuse to believe we all go down in flames 
 I wake up in the middle of combat 
 From the attack of the bomb killing on impact 
 Disintegration over the whole nation 
 And overseas victory to our enemies
