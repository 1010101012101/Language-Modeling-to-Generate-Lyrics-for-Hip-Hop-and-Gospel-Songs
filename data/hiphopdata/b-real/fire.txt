 Come down 
 Straight up we set the fire, we blaze 'em and do it properly 
 Sonically all we need is the honest and the cali weed 
 Roll up the sensei when you want to break up insanity 
 Hit it and pass it and we blazin' all of humanity 
 (Blaze it up) 
 Then we never care about what you say to us 
 (Blaze it up) 
 Everywhere we go we takin' the spray with us 
 (Blaze it up) 
 All the mamis in the club wanna blaze with us 
 (Blaze it up) 
 All you fuckin' haters remain hatin' us 
 We grow the crystal freely from dirt up to the ceiling 
 I know you want the feeling, you need some herbal healing 
 We flip it in the valley out here in southern Cali 
 I know you fuckers envy B-Real and Mr. Marley

 In Jamaica no mistakin' the ganja bus 
 Believe the kush is sticky and all the fiends are tricky 
 The pigs be comin' quickly, they can come and get me 
 Watch me smoke out the city, let's see who's comin' with me 
 The bong'll make you dizzy, it's gong and Mr. Brizzy
