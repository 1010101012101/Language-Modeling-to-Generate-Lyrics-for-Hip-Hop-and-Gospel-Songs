(Young Buck Talking) 
 If I should die before I wake 
 Lord Please my soul you'll take 
 Eh eh pass that blunt 
 Man I ain't even asked for this shit 
 Man this the realest shit I ever wrote though 
 But you know, I guess I'm thuggin' it up 
 There's no way I can hide it, you can see the pain in my eyes 
 I ain't thinkin' 'bout college to busy tryin' to stay alive 
 They done cut the water off and I ain't tryin' to see the lights go 
 Even little shit like 5 dollars I'ma fight fo' 
 My sisters only twelve and she's pregnant with a baby 
 My brothers goin' to jail and my mama's goin' crazy 
 I'm all by my self, mutha fuck my old lady 
 Cause soon no money left, she was fuckin' niggas daily 
 We already in hell Lord please can you save me 
 I'm ridin' with a 12 gauge I know these niggas hate me 
 I got a few birds and a few words for you niggas on the street 
 I'm swervin' in excursions I know you heard of me 
 I got them mad at me, I hit the block cop drop that nigga bad ain't he 
 We sell rocks, bust glocks and keep our rags hangin' 
 Thug Niggas shootin they cops, Look we ain't playin' 
 Anywhere sittin' on shops 
 I wonder if I died and came back 
 Would God still make a nigga stay here and slang crack 
 Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat 
 There's gotta be somebody that can come and explain that 
 I knooowwwww 
 I wonder if I died and came back 
 Would God still make a nigga stay here and slang crack 
 Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat 
 There's gotta be somebody that can come and explain that 
 I knooowwwww 
 You got me ain't havin' bitches in the hood 
 There's snitches in the hood 
 My suggestion to you niggas start gettin' it while its good 
 If you crawl for your ball, learn the game 
 Know the things that'll get you knocked off cause niggas out here ain't playin' 
 Bein' real done popped off, 2 ??? in this home 
 Got me way in New York 'bout to run up in your home 
 I'm way up your floor, get my money and I'm gone 
 And if he paid me on time then we wouldn't have to show em' 
 But they got a place for him like they got a place for me 
 Maybe we'll meet again, we'll just have to wait and see 
 Thug niggas, I love killers who cock it back and bust 
 Remember me I used to smoke weed on the school bus 
 Nigga what, Nigga who, Nigga what you gon' do 
 I'm Young Buck, now move and let me come through 
 Is it true before you die do you really see it comin' 
 Do the hardest nigga cry and start runnin' 
 I wonder if I died and came back 
 Would God still make a nigga stay here and slang crack 
 Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat 
 There's gotta be somebody that can come and explain that 
 I knooowwwww 
 I wonder if I died and came back 
 Would God still make a nigga stay here and slang crack 
 Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat 
 There's gotta be somebody that can come and explain that 
 I knooowwwww 
 Polititians is bullshittin and really Bill Clinton is the 
 Closest we getting to ever having a black president 
 Still I feel heaven sentin, Tryin' to walk with my head up 
 Cause now we got this anthrax shit to be scared of 
 Nobody prepared us for this 
 All they said was make sure you watch the news at six 
 And we feeding all these other countrys 
 What about that old man eatin out the fuckin' dumpster 
 Oh you don't know him but everything goes up must come down 
 One love to all projects that got torn down 
 I'm ridin' with God, me and my sqaud nigga U.T.P 
 I'm ballin but just remember how it used to be 
 So regardless never let nothing come between 
 Our family, our money, our dream 
 And even when it seems like it's all over 
 From Tennessee to the Macknoya 
 We gunna ball till we fall 
 I wonder if I died and came back 
 Would God still make a nigga stay here and slang crack 
 Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat 
 There's gotta be somebody that can come and explain that 
 I knooowwwww 
 I wonder if I died and came back 
 Would God still make a nigga stay here and slang crack 
 Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat 
 There's gotta be somebody that can come and explain that 
 I knooowwwww 
 I wonder if I died and came back 
 Would God still make a nigga stay here and slang crack 
 Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat 
 There's gotta be somebody that can come and explain that 
 I knooowwwww 
 I wonder if I died and came back 
 Would God still make a nigga stay here and slang crack 
 Would everybody treat me like I was the same cat 
 There's gotta be somebody that can come and explain that
