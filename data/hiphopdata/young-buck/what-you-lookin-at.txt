 All my niggas that's strapped in the club

 (Verse 1: Sosa) 
 I think I know, its cause a niggas paid and you ain't rich yet 
 Waitin' on your first I'm on like my sixth big check 
 Quarter ounce saids nigga you ain't seen a brick yet 
 Walk around with my dick smellin' like your bitch breath 
 When I was broke and fucked they wasn't hatin' no 
 Rollin' in the latest cut 
 Dro in the masenger 
 I pull strings like a guitar 'cause 
 And roll blunts that end up better than the cigar was 
 I ain't negotiating my deal I was like "Pay me stunna" 
 Put a nigga out and watch me put out Jay-Z numbers 
 Made a hundred in '05 that was a crazy summer 
 Holla "Free everyone" out of an AP Hummer 
 Now my nigga out in L.A. got to say we gettin' money, long as fate keep it comin' 
 I'm a make another hundred 
 Grind hard motherfucker I'm about mine I do this 
 All Star fuckin' with Southside of the Unit

 (Verse 2: Hi-C) 
 I get paid off my blocks like Reggie White 
 I missed my seven flight 
 'Cause I had a ready bite 
 Oh we them block guys 
 Automatic Glock mask 
 I could show you how to whip it up clockwise 
 I use an AK nigga then pump the shotty 
 Put the heater in his mouth now that's a hot tamale 
 Dope boy swag 
 With a .44 Mag 
 Tied up in the bag 
 Got to get that cash... on the low 
 I can take you to the proper work 
 In that blue Bentley with Buck is that Papa Smurf? 
 I'll pop ya first 
 If you step wrong 
 Bulletproof Teflon 
 Maybe that's a deaf song 
 Have them bullets cave in his chest bone 
 The 380 look good cause its dressed chrome 
 For this Ca$hville shit I'll kill your ass 
 Fuck a check nigga Hi want a mill in cash 
 (Chorus: VOICE) 
 I'm about to see 
 Why you hatin' on me

 (Verse 3: C-Bo) 
 I got 'em mad at me 'cause I'm iced out 
 Ridin' hard shinin' just like a light house 
 Get money money 
 A hood boss that's why they hate me 
 Pissed off cause my shimmy come in packs a week 
 Plus my price is cheap 
 So you know my push is deep 
 Get it in and get it gone that's my recipe 
 (Keep it movin') 
 All that talk shit is weak man 
 My goons murder through the motherfuckin' street man 
 And I'm ridin' for my South niggas 
 So watch your mouth or them Ks 'gon come out niggas 
 Hatin' on the kid 
 Cause them bitches on my dick 
 Every car that I whip 
 Keep them rims doin' flips 
 Got 'em sick 
 I got money and the power 
 Any competition, game over I will holla 
 So get your mind right and get your money up 
 And stop hatin' before you get your life fucked up 
 (Chorus: VOICE)

 (Verse 4: Sosa) 
 I'm about to see man 
 Ho ass nigga 
 Hatin' ass nigga I can see it in your eyes 
 Is it the way I walk the shit, I talk or what I drive? 
 I do this shit for real niggas rappin' tellin' lies 
 About how they do pimpin', jackin', and sellin' pies 
 I be stayin' away from hos who don't want to see me on my grind 
 Cupcake I know your fine 
 But once I fuck I ain't got time 
 I hit the strip club with six or seven dimes 
 I break a chicken down flip six or seven times 
 The candy painted Chevy lookin' like a sip of wine 
 Perigon Impala nineteen sixty nine 
 I bought a brand new pistol it bust fifty times 
 In case a nigga out here try to fuck with my shine 
 I hit the club tryin' to push a couple of lines 
 Pop a couple of pills, get some hips and thighs 
 I put this on my tattoos do not blow my high 
 'Cause if we get into it somebody got to die
