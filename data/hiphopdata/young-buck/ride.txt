It is what it is, Lets ride nigga, Yeah! 
 What you niggas know about, slippin they clips in AK's 
 I'm talkin' bout hittin niggas blocks 
 I'm wipin down my bullets with my bandana hidden behind tips 
 The beef bout to be handled nigga gimme bout 5 minutes 
 I'm prayin' ain't no kids out playin' today 
 'Cause I ain't tryna see no babies gettin' hit with a stray 
 So if ya enemy is hidin home then turn off ya lights 
 Then throw this bitch in bar, we gettin' out tonight 
 I wanna look him in his eyes before he die 
 Some niggas get away when the shells start to fly 
 We gonn' make sure anybody out there breathin gonn' be bleedin 
 Everybody out there leakin then we leavin' 
 We get away, car parked in a dark alley 
 Just cut up through the yard, hop a fence then we at it 
 We off to the next block, catch me if you can 
 Gunpowder on my shirt and some blood on my hands 
 Never thought I'd see the day that I'd be killin' me a man 
 This here for 50's enemies to make 'em understand that 
 Even tho we killed one and we ain't done yet 
 We ridin' on these muthafuckas soon as the sun set 
 Gangsta with it, homie you know how I do 
 This just a lil somethin' you can let off ya glock to 
 Even tho we killed one and we ain't done yet 
 We ridin' on these muthafuckas soon as the sun set 
 Gangsta with it, homie you know how I do 
 This just a lil somethin' you can let off ya chopper to 
 Clip in the Smith and Wesson 
 And I done been shot but I ain't learn my lesson 
 I bought me some band-aids and hand grenades 
 And I'd pull the pin and throw it where ya family stay 
 This the hood muthafucka not Sandro Pay 
 You hear the police sirens all god damn day 
 We huntin for our prey, if we see 'em we eat em 
 And fuck the D.A., they ain't takin' my freedom 
 So when you make this turn, ima let off this thang 
 Retaliating on them bitches like Hugh did Kane 
 Insane, I'm the black John Wayne 
 With a chrome Fo-Fo, put a hole in ya frame 
 Detectives found 'em with his watch and his chain 
 And some money in his pocket, a bullet in his brain 
 Never thought I'd see the day that I'd be killin' me a man 
 This here for Yayo enemies to make 'em understand what I'm sayin' is 
 Even tho we killed one and we ain't done yet 
 We ridin' on these muthafuckas soon as the sun set 
 Gangsta with it, homie you know how I do 
 This just a lil somethin' you let ya fo-five off to 
 Even tho we killed one and we ain't done yet 
 We ridin' on these muthafuckas soon as the sun set 
 Gangsta with it, homie you know how I do 
 This just a lil somethin' you let ya 12-gauge off to 
 I'd be lyin' if I say I wasn't nervous the first time 
 But thinkin' how they shot my cousin, I just bust mine 
 Hard people glance, glock under my waist 
 This big fat ass officer ain't gonn' win this chase 
 I'm paranoid but I got away clean 
 And I don't be havin' all them nightmare dreams 
 They say I have no conscience, my heart just cold 
 'Cause I don't try to squash it, ya boy just roll 
 We hold niggas hostage, ya kid now hosed 
 The news to this game man we play how it goes 
 The feds know my name so I stay on the low 
 Every murder that go down they knockin' at my door 
 Gotta know what you doin' and how to shuffle it out 
 And once the homie go do it he gotta muzzle his mouth 
 I never thought I'd see the day that I'd be killin' me a man 
 This here for Banks enemies to make 'em understand what I'm sayin' is 
 Even tho we killed one and we ain't done yet 
 We ridin' on these muthafuckas soon as the sun set 
 Gangsta with it, homie you know how I do 
 This just a lil somethin' you let ya Tec 9 off to 
 Even tho we killed one and we ain't done yet 
 We ridin' on these muthafuckas soon as the sun set 
 Gangsta with it, homie you know how I do 
 This just a lil somethin' you let ya .40 Cal off to
