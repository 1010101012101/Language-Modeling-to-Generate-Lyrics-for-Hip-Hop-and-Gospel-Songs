Young Buck: 
 Aiyo Kay Slay 
 Aiyo what's up nigga 
 I see you nigga 
 Ha Young Buck 
 Aiyo I got my weight up 
 And I ain't been in the jail neither nigga 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Every hood get ready I've been in the kitchen I'm back 
 My cook game wicked I flip it and count stacks 
 My hands still in it so my finger nails dirty 
 I can't switch teams like Vince Chesterverte 
 Rappers be keepin' my name in they mouth 
 I say something back and I might lose count 
 Hold up 400, 500 thousand damn that's what I'm talkin' about 
 I goin' on 
 To all my enemies so long 
 Ya ain't killed me yet might as well go home 
 I'm a boss I could've been got it done it don't cost 
 Just love to shoot where I'm from so knock it off 
 You niggas soft 
 I'm overseas with 50 we playin' golf 
 You see the streets already know I bust my heat 
 And if the police know about it this ain't beef 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Let 'em hate 
 Let 'em hate 
 Let 'em hate 
 Let 'em hate 
 Fuck them hos 
 What? this the way I roll 
 Just a gangsta, hustler this all I know 
 Let 'em hate 
 Let 'em hate 
 Let 'em hate 
 Let 'em hate 
 Fuck them hos 
 They just mad they broke 
 I get money you niggas used to have the dough 
 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 I see the craziest shit on TV 
 So I ain't got to adjust to nothing y'all see me 
 Life is hard homie but dying is easy 
 We give to the rich but we take from the needy 
 Damn 
 That's why we break down grams 
 No ho training we don't say yes mam 
 Keep on hatin' you don't know who I am 
 The chopper go blah and the glock go blam 
 I ain't got no fam 
 But no friends 
 Some niggas ain't got no Lamb or no Benz 
 Some niggas ain't got them rims that just spin 
 Some niggas ain't got no ends 
 My brother in the pen 
 But when he comin' out I might be goin' in 
 You see the streets already know I bust my heat 
 And if the police know about it this ain't beef 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Let 'em hate 
 Let 'em hate 
 Let 'em hate 
 Let 'em hate 
 Fuck them hos 
 What? this the way I roll 
 Just a gangsta, hustler this all I know 
 Let 'em hate 
 Let 'em hate 
 Let 'em hate 
 Let 'em hate 
 Fuck them hos 
 They just mad they broke 
 I get money you niggas used to have the dough
