Solider heartless with ths AK you can't kill me 
 I'm God's best friend, I feel when the devil near me 
 You can see it clearly, its death before dishonor, 
 When it come down to the drama I'm the black osama 
 They hate me but can't break me, go head and separate me 
 Cause the rap game didn't make me 
 The streets is what raised me 
 And I might get hit but I won't fall down, 
 Ain't enough water for buck to drown 
 Ain't enough dollars I'm not around, 
 Id rather stay home smarter now 
 Stand my ground, focus man 
 Swear that I'll never go broke again 
 All I'm sayin' just know I'm here 
 Even though I'm not close to them, 
 Whatever don't kill me make me stronger 
 You stop but I last longer 
 You hot but I'm pneumonia 
 Hard to get off when I get on ya 
 Still smokin' my marijuana, my chevy still turnin' corners, 
 So clean you know what I mean, I am the American dream 
 My crown it can't be took, its cool I'm overlooked 
 My life can't go in no book, bredren bring in the hook
