(Chorus x2: Lloyd Banks) 
 G-Unit (we 2nd time) makes the croud get live 
 So put on your A game 
 Crush the competition 
 Let the best man win 
 'Cause it's me against you 
 Toe to toe 
 Blow for blow 
 I can guarantee you gon' lose 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Watch out I got my 2 strings tied 
 I'm wicked inside 
 You should see me when I'm flyin' from the free throw line 
 We ain't on the playground 
 See there's rules to this game 
 Shake him with the crossover 
 Then I move to the lane 
 You lookin' at the clock 
 Ma I'm lookin' for the rock 
 Ain't no player who can stop 
 This killer jump shot 
 And I still got hops 
 So gon' give me props 
 If ya bring it in here 
 I bet you can't make the shot 
 (Chorus x2: Lloyd Banks) 
 G-Unit ["we" 2nd time] makes the croud get live

 Toe to toe

 I can guarantee you gon' lose
