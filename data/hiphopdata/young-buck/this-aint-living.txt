Young Buck: 
 Drunker than a motherfucker tryin' to make it home 
 Pedal to the metal with no headlights on 
 Hennessey and weed with the shots of Patrone 
 I'll have a nigga's dick hard all night long 
 The rain can't stop me I'm sittin' on chrome 
 The police watch me to catch me in the wrong 
 My hood got love for me and when its on 
 If a nigga get a word bet a nigga gettin' gone 
 You niggas livin' dead when you workin' for the Feds 
 You get a little bread then get popped in the head 
 A white t-shirt with your face on the front 
 Nobody at the church ever respect what you done 
 So I'm a give 'em hell 
 Till they open up the cells 
 For the young black males 
 Twenty five in hell 
 I'm out on bail and I ain't goin' back 
 Just hope that my parole officer's knowin' that 
 (Chorus: Vocal Sample) 
 Livin' a little harder 
 What do I do with my life? 
 Livin' a little harder 
 What do I do with my life? 
 This ain't livin' 
 Nah nah baby this ain't livin' 
 Ah nah nah 
 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 The ghettos full of rules that you got to live by 
 The metal I use is a Glock .45 
 My best friend died and I didn't even cry 
 Been tryin' to find who killed him to set him on fire 
 The project buildings is gettin' torn down 
 They got us in one place so it's a war now 
 Pay what you weigh don't nobody give credit no more 
 You don't know what to do with it what you sellin' it for? 
 Seen fake niggas live and some real niggas go 
 So I really will kill and I'm hard on a ho 
 Shootin' at my enemies killin' 'em all 
 I will not sleep I got to find who killed my dog 
 Lil Jimmy locked up so until he come home 
 Got a wall full of platinum, pocket full of stones 
 I'm out here on my own 
 Holdin' it down 
 And I'm not goin' back my P.O. know now 
 Come on 
 (Chorus: Vocal Sample) 
 Livin' a little harder 
 What do I do with my life? 
 Livin' a little harder 
 What do I do with my life? 
 This ain't livin' 
 This ain't livin' 
 Nah nah baby this ain't livin' 
 Ah nah nah 
 This ain't livin' 
 This ain't livin' 
 Nah nah baby this ain't livin' 
 Ah nah nah 
 Young Buck: 
 Yeah, now lets ride niggas 
 Roll your weed, fill your cups up 
 You now ridin' with a gangsta nigga
