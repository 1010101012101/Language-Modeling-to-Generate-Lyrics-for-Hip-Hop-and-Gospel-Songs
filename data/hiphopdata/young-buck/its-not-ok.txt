"Ay yo, what up? It's Young Buck people! 
 Dirty South stand up mayne, Eastcoast let's go, Westside let's ride! 
 Oh... I'm good, It's two sides of every story nigga." 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Push your bubs pipes, your life get wiped away, it's a price you pay to wear that ice today. 
 So that say we ain't shit 'cause we clamin' the corner. 
 Well sorry you don't live, where I live your honor. 
 The feds don't care, look what they did to drama and what they gon' do, if we collect Obama. 
 The reason I say, we livin' in last day's, cause shawty got aids givin' pussy away. 
 Maybe I should stab another nigga for DRE 
 Or be the DJ to get some radio play, 
 If I walk right pass ya with nothing to say, holla back another day, 'cause I'm not okay. 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Momma always told me every day is like this 
 So when you grow up, don't play that shit. 
 Daddy always told me every day is like this 
 He say "Son don't you play that shit" 
 And I know, if I go, one of you motherfuckers is comin' with me, 
 Somebody gon' die to night, my mind ain't right 
 Stop fucking with me, you can't see that I'm not okay. 
 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 Temperature rising, barely surviving', kill with no hidin', they shootin' when I ridin' 
 There comes a time, when the sun goes down, the killers come out, the cowards can't be found. 
 Animal instinct, I smell bitch niggas, before they make it to me, I know how to deal with em' 
 Last year wasn't fair, I was almost there, made more in the streets then my own rap carrie 
 When the camaras ain't on nigga, I ain't hole and my presents ain't shown nigga, I ain't gon' 
 Buck gettin' to the money homie, I ain't row and the drow time comin', 
 But you know I'm on, holla back! 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Momma always told me every day is like this 
 So when you grow up, don't play that shit. 
 Daddy always told me every day is like this 
 He say "Son don't you play that shit" 
 And I know, if I go, one of you motherfuckers is comin' with me, 
 Somebody gon' die to night, my mind ain't right 
 Stop fucking with me, you can't see that I'm not okay. 
 (Speakin': Young Buck) 
 "I mean... I done speak it for it self. 
 What you see, is what you get and 
 What you hear is, what it is... For me anyway, I'm doin' me. 
 DRE! What up homie? Em... Oh man, you know you my nigga mayne. 
 Ay! Just sayin' dough, look it, look it where we at... 
 It's cool, ha ha ha 'cause I'm good man. 
 I'm in the streets... And my daughter... I mean my kids gon' eat regardless homie. 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Momma always told me every day is like this 
 So when you grow up, don't play that shit. 
 Daddy always told me every day is like this 
 He say "Son don't you play that shit" 
 And I know, if I go, one of you motherfuckers is comin' with me, 
 Somebody gon' die to night, my mind ain't right 
 Stop fucking with me, you can't see that I'm not okay.
