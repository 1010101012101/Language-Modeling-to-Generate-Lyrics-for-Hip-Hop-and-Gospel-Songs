(Feat. Sosa and Hi C) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah oh yeah yeah 
 (Intro: Young Buck) 
 Its colder than muhfucka outside... 
 I gotta get this money though, fuck that 
 (Chorus: Sosa) 
 Row, row, row, ya boat (slow) 
 Slowly down the street (yeah) 
 Smokin' mary, mary, mary, mary 
 Come and buy your dope from me 
 (Verse 1: Sosa) 
 I hit my first lick, must've been the seventh grade 
 I came up on a chunk, I bought a coat and pair of J's 
 And I ain't feel bad about it, on the block it was the way 
 I had to bend the rules a bit, I was tryin' to eat with snakes 
 Bought a pack, paid my momma's light bill in about a day 
 You just witnessed the plubs introduction to the game 
 Twenty five birds on the counter shit ain't changed 
 My Mexican been lettin' me get them chickens to the thang 
 I'm smokin' somethin' exquisite ridin' tinted in the Range 
 That is lookin' just like Buck chain and his ring 
 Spinnin' through the city watchin' menace feelin' king 
 Jada Pinkett ridin' with me, lip game insane 
 Man 
 (Chorus: Sosa) 
 Row, row, row, ya boat (slow) 
 Slowly down the street (yeah) 
 Smokin' mary, mary, mary, mary 
 Come and buy your dope from me 
 (Verse 2: Hi-C) 
 Sandwich bags, some Pyrex and some cocaine 
 Follow me as I take you to the dope game 
 I got felonies I can't get a nine to five 
 Quarter chickens... five Gs now that's time for five 
 I can't fuck with homeboy I heard he would tell 
 All black Geneva scales 
 Dope under my fingernails 
 Hot water, abra-kadabra, ready rocks 
 I spray your plastic Glock 
 Candy red Chevy drop 
 Flood this motherfucker, coke all on every block 
 Tryin' to be number one like the chain that Nelly got 
 White square blocks like a baseball field 
 Erase all fielders, the south, Eightball pills 
 (Chorus: Sosa) 
 Row, row, row, ya boat (slow) 
 Slowly down the street (yeah) 
 Smokin' mary, mary, mary, mary 
 Come and buy your dope from me 
 Please 
 Row, row, row, ya boat (slow) 
 Slowly down the street (yeah) 
 Smokin' mary, mary, mary, mary 
 Come and buy your dope from me 
 (Verse 3: Young Buck) 
 I got my hooptie on hub caps postin', they lookin' for twenty fours 
 They pullin' niggas over that look like they gettin' dough 
 I stop at the store, to get some zip-lock bags 
 I got a jar full of dro, I got to get rid of that 
 You know what they doin' for, ain't no need to ask 
 And if your only buyin' one, I don't need your cash 
 Homie, just stay in your weight class and get you a safe stash 
 Whip it, whip, it, whip it, whip it, nigga then break the glass 
 These hoes will tell on you, I'm tellin' you the truth 
 And if a hater try to rob you I'm tellin' you to shoot
