You look all around the world, it's the same shit 
 I mean niggas tryna eat, and it's a drier than a motherfucker out here right now 
 But real hood niggas hold it down no matter what, ya heard (yeah!) 
 See the thing about a real nigga is 
 Whatever a bitch nigga do he could never stop that real nigga 
 See we should stand up for the haters right now 
 Because those bitch niggas make the world go 'round (Hahaha!) 
 Yeah, you don't have to fuck with me 'cause I ain't fuckin' witcha 
 I'm riding dirty with this work and my mother bitchin' 
 40 cal. under my shirt and another pistol 
 Fuck a friend, all of y'all can get your issue 
 Phone calls from the pen real niggas witchu 
 They say they shed a couple tears 'cause a nigga miss you 
 Avoiding hoes, no award shows 
 They been askin' where his boy go 
 Can he even pay his taxes? 
 Only lord knows what he do to get his dough 
 Let 50 tell 'em buck is jealous and the nigga broke 
 But we just seen him man, we hearin' what the nigga wrote (hey!) 
 That nigga's ballin' even if he's sniffin' coke (fa' sho) 
 They prayin' on my downfall tryna set me broke (fuck!) 
 But what a nigga come from I don't think they know (nah) 
 Pussy niggas in the game done turned on me (turned on me) 
 For the money and the fame, you gon' learn homie

 Dope boy in the streets hustlin' again 
 You pussy niggas wanna beef, we can get it in 
 Black tall, hair wall, where your bangs at? 
 Hit you with this shit and show you why he came back 
 Hangin' out of the window bustin' on the freeway 
 I'm with my homie it was his quarter key way 
 If Obama has a plan, where it at? 
 'Cause it's a drop and nobody know where it's at 
 But in the south what we lose, we just get it back 
 We listen to scarface, he motivates blacks 
 Then we make stacks 
 Fuck a cop, they can die too 
 Before you hide me bitch, we gon' hide you 
 These rappers don't fuck with the streets like I do 
 It's all good, I'll still stand beside you

 Don't look at me 'cause I ain't givin' niggas nothin' else 
 Show 'em love then they leave me by my fucking self 
 My heart cold and I know it'll never melt 
 I just gotta play the cards that a nigga dealt 
 (?) 
 Ridin' dirty in a riddle with the wrong tags 
 Presidential in the gutter when they doin' bad 
 Concentrate on what I got, fuck what I had 
 Dirty south on top and some niggas mad 
 Go take a trip to the fields and you can get your swag 
 Yeah I'm glad they done kicked me out the fuckin' group 
 'Cause now the world see I'm the motherfuckin' truth 
 Got the streets like, damn homie what happened to you 
 I bet this conversation they tappin' it too 
 I get paper 
 If you so major 
 Your team ain't shit without the number one playah 
 (We know that your'all)
