Summertime drop top shit, ya know 
 (Hey, what it do) 
 Yeah 
 (It's goin' down, we pullin' the cars out man) 
 When the rain stops 
 (Let's ride) 
 Come on 
 (You know what it is) 
 Come on 
 Yeah 
 (Hey) 
 Hey 
 (I'm talkin' about Cashville sunshine) 
 You know what it is 
 (Miami sunshine) 
 When the rain stops 
 (California sunshine) 
 Let's get it 
 Hey, what it do, shorty, yeah 
 (Hey) 
 Woke up ready to shine, I'm ready to grind 
 In '08, I was '09, ahead of my time 
 I'm about to give it to 'em, yeah, fresh out the shop 
 Let me call Big Rich, tell him pull out his drop 
 I walk in my walk in closet 
 Shorty got a outfit for me but I already bought it 
 Breakfast, yes, it's the morning blunt 
 I get a couple more in me, then we goin' to lunch 
 Put on my necklace, white gold, nothin' too reckless 
 But just enough ice to make you haters respect this 
 Garage door open, about to do my thizzle 
 Shit goin' good till I felt that drizzle 
 Right back in my drop top, make the front end hop 
 Hit the block, when the rain stops 
 I'm don't ridin' and I can't stop 
 Sittin' high, no lie, just watch 
 When the rain stops 
 We trappin' over here around the clock 
 Got the block on lock 
 It don't matter if the rain stops 
 Now make it rain 
 (Make it rain) 
 Make it rain 
 (Make it rain) 
 Make it rain 
 (Make it rain) 
 Rain drops 
 Day turns to night as the rain pours 
 Wet streets, still I'm a do what I came for 
 Black skies got the ghetto inside 
 All the hustlers that was tired, waitin' on the sunrise 
 Right back before all the mud dries 
 This is what happens when a thug cries 
 I'm everywhere like a Crip with Blood ties 
 My niggaz like, "Buck let one of us drive" 
 They know I'm gon' be doin' a buck five 
 Brand new rims, plus tires 
 Even if the storm don't stop when it does get hot 
 You can bet the whole pot, I am in the hood like 
 Right back in my drop top, make the front end hop 
 Hit the block, when the rain stops 
 I'm don't ridin' and I can't stop 
 Sittin' high, no lie, just watch 
 When the rain stops 
 We trappin' over here around the clock 
 Got the block on lock 
 It don't matter if the rain stops 
 Now make it rain 
 (Make it rain) 
 Make it rain 
 (Make it rain) 
 Make it rain 
 (Make it rain) 
 Rain drops 
 See I remember way back 
 When my grandmother used to be like 
 "Boy, turn that TV off, it's raining outside" 
 And just like then, I can't wait to get back out there 
 So I can keep shinin' on you hatin' ass niggaz 
 It's Young Buck bitch, hey 
 And just know one thing shorty 
 It can't rain forever, baby 
 I'm comin', I'll be on my way to get it 
 Yeah, just hold up for a minute 
 When the rain stops 
 And yeah, you know what to do 
 Just turn me up and listen to them 
 Rain drops 
 DJ's know what it is 
 The streets know what I'm a do 
 When the rain stops, let's go 
 And then it's right back 
 But y'all always gon' hear them 
 Rain drops 
 Hey Buck, where you at? 
 Right back in my drop top, make the front end hop 
 Hit the block, when the rain stops 
 I'm don't ridin' and I can't stop 
 Sittin' high, no lie, just watch 
 When the rain stops 
 We trappin' over here around the clock 
 Got the block on lock 
 It don't matter if the rain stops 
 Now make it rain 
 (Make it rain) 
 Make it rain 
 (Make it rain) 
 Make it rain 
 (Make it rain) 
 Rain drops
