(Intro-young buck) 
 Young buck, lil flip, david banner c'mon 
 G-unit in this bitch, g-unit in this bitch 
 The dirty, dirty 
 Show 'em how the south do 
 (Chorus-young buck) 
 Gold grills, coupe' devilles sittin' on 22's 
 The dirty, dirty baby 
 Show 'em how the south do 
 We pop pills, shoot to kill, you know what we 'bout 
 And on behalf of g-unit, welcome to the south 
 (Verse one-young buck) 
 Working this wood wheel, y'all don't know how good it feel 
 Just come to cashville, y'all gon see how hood it is 
 We in the projects, cookin' chikens in the kitchen 
 We goto prison, but get out and go back to get in it 
 Your hood ain't no harder than mine, bitch, we all thuggin' 
 We fight in clubs, hit the parkin lot, and start bustin' 
 I know I'm country, I can't help it I'm from tennessee 
 I'm throwin' up this hennisey, blowin' up my enemies 
 Y'all niggas remember me? not because the bird's ten a key 
 But young buck been a g', I give a fuck who you be boy 
 I want in on everything, a dime bag, if so come see me for it 
 To be a star, all you need is a pyrex jar 
 Some soldiers, and some baking soda, you can buy that car 
 (Chorus-young buck) 
 Gold grills, coupe' devilles sittin' on 22's 
 The dirty, dirty baby 
 Show 'em how the south do 
 We pop pills, shoot to kill, you know what we 'bout 
 And on behalf of g-unit, welcome to the south 
 (Verse two-david banner) 
 I swear on the souls of my dead cousins 
 I ain't fussin, man I'm commin ak 40's bussin', 
 7's and mack 11's 
 I told 'em all I ain't no hoe 
 But niggas don't listen till you kick a nigga, 
 Smack him with that callico 
 I'm tryin' to stay in god's plan 
 But I had ta show these faggots that your fuckin' with a man, ya bitch! 
 I left them niggas needin'path 
 And y'all probly won't live to see this weekend, 
 Gotta go, gotta go, fuckin' mash out 
 I hit the dro' a lil more and then I pass out 
 Crashin' the h2, bitches I hate you 
 Now you keep talkin' shit, I kidnap and duct tape you 
 Let them faggots rape you 
 Then it's back to Mississippi, if ya boys want revenge 
 Tell them bitches come and get me 
 'Cause I was born in this bitch to die 
 I'm in queens, in your 'lac, with your bitch, gettin' high 
 (Chorus-young buck) 
 Gold grills, coupe' devilles sittin' on 22's 
 The dirty, dirty baby 
 Show 'em how the south do 
 We pop pills, shoot to kill, you know what we 'bout 
 And on behalf of g-unit, welcome to the south 
 (Verse three-lil flip) 
 I'm the king, it ain't no mystery, so fuck y'all niggas dissin' me 
 I'm goin' down in history, I'm leavin' with a victory 
 Yo' baby momma kissin' me, talkin' 'bout she missin' me 
 Since I'm a star, when I hit the door, they never friskin' me 
 'Cause I pack a pound, just ask around, like 50 "I'll back you down" 
 Run in ya' crib and snach ya' pounds, everybody on the ground 
 You know my niggas hold me down, what goes around comes around 
 I represent h-town, still run the underground 
 With bricks on the greyhound, spree's on my escalade 
 I'm glad I made it out the game, it gotta be a better way 
 Now we gettin' cheeda', now we on another level 
 It's clover g and g-unit, young buck, shut 'em down 
 (Chorus-young buck) 
 Gold grills, coupe' devilles sittin' on 22's 
 The dirty, dirty baby 
 Show 'em how the south do 
 We pop pills, shoot to kill, you know what we 'bout 
 And on behalf of g-unit, welcome to the south 
 Gold grills, coupe' devilles sittin' on 22's 
 The dirty, dirty baby 
 Show 'em how the south do 
 We pop pills, shoot to kill, you know what we 'bout 
 And on behalf of g-unit, welcome to the south
