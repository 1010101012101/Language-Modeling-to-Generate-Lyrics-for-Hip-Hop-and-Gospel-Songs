(Feat. Paul Wall) 
 Paul Wall: 
 Rap City we live in the booth right now 
 Paul Wall holdin' it down as a host 
 We got Young Buck buckin' the world right now 
 Signin'

 Whoo Kid on the tables

 Young Buck:

 I gotta tat it up in here for a minute 
 Paul Wall:

 Young Buck: 
 Hey yo shout out to Swizz 
 Shout out to everybody 
 I'm a rip this Swizz this is what I'm a do for it 
 Check me out 
 Hold on lets see 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Let me put this on ya brain 
 If rap stopped today I'd still do my thang 
 I bought a business before I bought me a chain 
 Took my mama out the bricks and put a car in her name 
 Pay my homies Half's bond just to get him on the street 
 Hopin' if I get locked up 50 do it for me 
 Payin' everybodys bills 
 I'm locked down for real 
 This is what we do we get it how we live 
 Hey yo Paul Wall I keep tellin' 'em 
 All these dudes don't know what we sellin' them 
 I get to the money 
 Y'all know what it is you will never take nothing from me 
 Freestylin', buck wilding off the dome 
 Give me a second and I'll be off in ya home 
 I ain't playin' I ain't doin' none of that 
 I came in here strapped 
 To give Fisk and Pog caps 
 Infared on all straps 
 Holla when you see me 
 Right here BET I'm on TV 
 Ain't too many of y'all can be me 
 Cause y'all is smaller than Beanie 
 Young Buck: 
 Get to the money holla man 
 Straight off the dome bro 
 That's freestylin' 
 Paul Wall: 
 Now that's freestylin' 
 Young Buck: 
 That ain't just spittin' on paper 
 Paul Wall: 
 No pen and paper 
 That's freestylin' 
 Young Buck: 
 I wanted to give y'all me just freestylin' man 
 Paul Wall: 
 Live in the booth baby 
 On Rap City baby 
 Its Young Buck 
 Buckin' the world 
 And Paul Wall 
 Gettin' money and stayin' true baby 
 We out of here
