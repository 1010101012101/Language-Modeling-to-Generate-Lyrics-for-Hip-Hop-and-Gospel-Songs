Hey Whoo Kid, he hotter than a motherfucker 
 Young Buck: 
 Hey yo, you know what? 
 I'm startin' to feel myself a little bit 
 You know? 
 Money lookin' right 
 The block lookin' good 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 And niggas is eatin' around my way 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 We be countin' big stacks 
 Candy paintin' Cadillacs 
 Chevy got that thing in the back 
 And I just bought another pack 
 Blow some weed in this bitch 
 Just bought another pack 
 Blow some weed in this bitch 
 We be countin' big stacks 
 Candy paintin' Cadillacs 
 Chevy got that thing in the back 
 And I just bought another pack 
 Blow some weed in this bitch 
 Just bought another pack 
 Blow some weed in this bitch 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 The mayor of the city 
 I know you niggas hear me 
 I park the Phantom in the projects just me and 50 
 The Dope Boy Committee 
 Go fill an application out 
 We 'gon give you a call back if it's what you say its 'bout 
 All right let's get this money niggas 
 We trappin' twenty hours until they come and get us 
 I can't be movin' over no pennies 
 'Cause we will come and get it 
 So all you niggas with them high prices I ain't with it 
 Spit it... 
 Down the middle 
 Flip it and give me mine 
 I'd be lyin' 
 If I said that I stopped but I'm tryin' 
 What you buyin'? 
 What you need 
 Where you at? Where you be 
 Got the coke 
 Got the dope 
 Got the bills and the weed 
 Come on 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 We be countin' big stacks 
 Candy paintin' Cadillacs 
 Chevy got that thing in the back 
 And I just bought another pack 
 Blow some weed in this bitch 
 Just bought another pack 
 Blow some weed in this bitch 
 We be countin' big stacks 
 Candy paintin' Cadillacs 
 Chevy got that thing in the back 
 And I just bought another pack 
 Blow some weed in this bitch 
 Just bought another pack 
 Blow some weed in this bitch 
 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 Pillsbury Dough Boy painted on the side 
 Baking soda seats this my dope man ride 
 All the junkies see me comin' 
 And they all get to runnin' 
 Before I can get out they hollain' "What you got for me?" 
 I make another stack 
 Then go check another trap 
 Got my mind on my money and my hand on my strap 
 The block throw a party when a cop get shot 
 So when they come through here... They do not stop 
 And everyday we hustlin' like it or not 
 Just keep the old folks cool and we can set up shop 
 These young niggas act a fool start runnin' it hot 
 If a nigga break the rules I'm a show him what I got 
 Bitch 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 We be countin' big stacks 
 Candy paintin' Cadillacs 
 Chevy got that thing in the back 
 And I just bought another pack 
 Blow some weed in this bitch 
 Just bought another pack 
 Blow some weed in this bitch 
 We be countin' big stacks 
 Candy paintin' Cadillacs 
 Chevy got that thing in the back 
 And I just bought another pack 
 Blow some weed in this bitch 
 Just bought another pack 
 Blow some weed in this bitch 
 Young Buck: 
 Yeah dope boy music nigga 
 Hey Houston, Buck The World 
 Spray paint it on the project buildings for me niggas

 I know they gettin' money in the A 
 They gettin' money in Memphis

 Money everywhere shit

 Do the math bitch
