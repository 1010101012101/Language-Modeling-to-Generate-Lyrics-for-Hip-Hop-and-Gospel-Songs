Wassup baby 
 You know we been together for a long time 
 You know we been through alot 
 We had our ups and our downs 'n' shit 
 But now girl I'm ready, wassup 
 The day whenever since I picked you up 
 You told me, you'd never let 'em hit me up 
 I believed ya, knowin' in my heart I'd need ya 
 Put you on my waist so no one could see ya 
 Boppin niggas hatchets ya know what to do witcha 
 Used ya up and tomorrow they through witcha 
 I might of kicked you out the car before 
 But I came back to get ya when they let me go 
 Had to fill ya up and get you back to the streets 
 A couple of jobs gotta get done before we sleep 
 I love you girl, you done increased my salary 
 So tonight I'm askin will you marry me 
 (Chorus-Girl/(Young Buck)) 
 For so long that we been friends 
 I never seen so much in you (We ridint tonight, we ridin' tonight) 
 Lets start this love affair again 
 I never seen so much in you (Ride-di-di Rideee) 
 Talk to 'em girl let 'em hear yo name 
 Niggas get scared when you spit out flames 
 Ya like when I hold ya and squeeze ya 
 As soon as ya empty I run to go feed ya 
 Point you at people, and when you open ya mouth 
 These industry niggas find out what we bout 
 I told ya, ride with a soldier 
 You ain't got time to be trapped in a holster 
 When we roll with 'em remember what I showed ya 
 Had to remind you, the beefs not over 
 Here we go girl heres my proposal 
 I can feel it, you gettin' closer and closer 
 (Chorus-Girl/(Young Buck)) 
 For so long that we been friends 
 I never seen so much in you (We ridint tonight, we ridin' tonight) 
 Lets start this love affair again 
 I never seen so much in you (Ride-di-di Rideee) 
 So what it do shawty 
 It's me and you, you know 
 I mean I'm ready, you been actin' like you ready 
 Fuck it, MARRY ME
