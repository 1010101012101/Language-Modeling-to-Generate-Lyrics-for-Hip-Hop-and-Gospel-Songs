Young Buck: 
 Where the trap boys at? 
 Where the dope boys at? 
 Where the trap boys at? 
 Where the dope boys at? 
 Yo 
 Its about to go down 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 What you need where you wanna meet me at? 
 They shut the trap down but you see we right back 
 No scales I'm eyeballin' everything 
 Stash box everywhere and my Chevy stained 
 What a whip I cook it in the microwave 
 And when I'm not on the block then you might get paid 
 Here I go 
 Get grams for the lo lo 
 354 ounce of that snow snow 
 I'm the man 
 The dope man bitch 
 With platinum on my neck rose gold on my wrist 
 You may have alot of bricks but I got much more 
 And still got the nuts to put ya brains on the floor 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Come on you ain't ready this game ain't for you 
 I hear you got the work but you can't move it like I do 
 You can't move it like I do 
 You can't move it like I do 
 Ya price ain't right you can't move it like I do 
 The fiends know my name they tell me I'm the truth 
 They say you got the work but you can't move it like I do 
 You can't move it like I do 
 You can't move it like I do 
 Ya coke ain't white you can't move it like I do 
 (Verse 2: D-Tay) 
 Look D-Tay I got the yayo 
 20 for the way-lows 
 Just meet me at the spot and drop my motherfuckin' mayo 
 Me Yayo 
 In New York smokin' sour diesel 
 The Desert Eagle'll reach you shoot up to ya Regal 
 Two heaters on the kitchen table serving coke 
 Baking soda make the dope double that's my antidote 
 Punks tryin' to keep up with the Unit 
 I'm still into trappin' crack, bangin' up them women 
 Assuming you niggas don't need work when you do 
 Just holla cause boy I got a bargain for you 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Where the trap boys at? 
 Where the dope boys at? 
 Where the trap boys at? 
 Where the dope boys at? 
 Come on you ain't ready this game ain't for you 
 I hear you got the work but you can't move it like I do 
 You can't move it like I do 
 You can't move it like I do 
 Ya price ain't right you can't move it like I do 
 The fiends know my name they tell me I'm the truth 
 They say you got the work but you can't move it like I do 
 You can't move it like I do 
 You can't move it like I do 
 Ya coke ain't white you can't move it like I do 
 (Verse 3: Hi-C) 
 I got the work in the Dirty South so fill my team 
 Yeah them pretty white rocks and them good tongue greens 
 Who is that comin' through in that old school 
 828 Alpha Block yeah I'm so cool 
 The homies hit the studio up with four bricks 
 30 Gs, 6 pistols and I'm still in this bitch 
 Million dollar bond, no probable cause 
 My next tattoo on my back "Fuck The Laws" nigga 
 (Verse 4: Young Buck) 
 Talkin' dirty on my cell phone fuck it 
 The feds come get me bet a nigga start bustin' 
 We ain't stoppin' 
 Got the neighborhood poppin' 
 These hos bird watchin' 
 Cause of the money that I'm clockin' 
 I'm clean 
 EV2 jeans 
 A pair of Air Jordans that a nigga never seen 
 What it cost 
 Damn right its on me 
 I'm only 24 feelin' like a O.G. 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Come on you ain't ready this game ain't for you 
 I hear you got the work but you can't move it like I do 
 You can't move it like I do 
 You can't move it like I do 
 Ya price ain't right you can't move it like I do 
 The fiends know my name they tell me I'm the truth 
 They say you got the work but you can't move it like I do 
 You can't move it like I do 
 You can't move it like I do 
 Ya coke ain't white you can't move it like I do 
 Young Buck: 
 Aiyo follow me niggas 
 I'm on my way to the trap house
