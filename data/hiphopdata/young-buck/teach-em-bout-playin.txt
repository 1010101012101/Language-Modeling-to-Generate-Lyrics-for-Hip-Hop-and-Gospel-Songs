(Feat. C-Bo) 
 Young Buck: 
 Yeah I done seen this before 
 Nigga this ain't woe 
 Until your brains all over the floor 
 You fuck niggas out of line 
 But y'all know I'm one of a kind 
 A hundred shots comin' at one time it go (brrrrat!) 
 Get back, you fuckin' with a grown ass man 
 I came by myself so alone I stand 
 Don't let them gas you 
 These shells won't pass you 
 So pick up the phone I got some questions to ask you 
 I'm doin' what I have to do, these niggas hatin' 
 I'm stationed, posted, patiently waitin' 
 See money ain't shit nigga you can be touched 
 You watchin' Godfather movies too much 
 I'm bout to push that button 
 You know when niggas come from everywhere 
 Grape Street get ready 
 Purple rags in the air, I don't care 
 Lets take it there, I'm gon' ride 
 I'm hittin every motherfucker outside 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 I'ma teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 Let me teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 Watch me teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 You know I'll die for this G-Unit shit so what you sayin' 50? 
 I'ma teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 Let me teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 Watch me teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 You know I'll ride for this G-Unit shit till the fed's come get me 
 Young Buck: 
 Niggas can't fuck with me, nor can they say "Fuck 50" 
 I'll poke a nigga's ass up quickly 
 So all y'all miss me with the latest hip-hop street news 
 About what my man said on Miss Jones interview 
 What you do, is open up the Billboard charts 
 I got the number one rap album so far 
 I'm on the cover of the XXL giving 'em hell 
 What I'm sayin', is Buck got records to sell 
 I'm not playin', just layin in the Maserati gitted up 
 Hell'll freeze before the G-Unit splits up 
 Banks at the bank, Yayo gettin' dough, and I'll buck ya down 
 Soon 50 holla (yo come on) 
 This is family, I don't know what you been told 
 Even our worst sellin albums, still went gold 
 And I made a few million before I picked up the mic 
 So if you gon' hate me, get your shit right (motherfuckers) 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 I'ma teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 Let me teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 Watch me teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 You know I'll die for this G-Unit shit so what you sayin' 50? 
 I'ma teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 Let me teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 Watch me teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 You know I'll ride for this G-Unit shit till the fed's come get me 
 C-Bo: 
 Buck say fuck it so fuck 'em 
 Load the K's up, lit them Trey's up 
 These niggas is pussy, virgins, they ain't been fucked before 
 Hundred rounds in the mac, they ain't been bucked before 
 Big fish in the water, Jaws, I'll slaughter ya man 
 Till the clique, all my arter was jammed 
 So butterfly, keep ya nine cocked 
 'Cause I could do time slots 
 Did mines like Tookie smilin' with mine's, pa 
 And yeah I heard about the streets and stompin 
 Ain't nothin' like the gardens of the streets of Compton 
 Yeah, hes a fruitcake 
 He thinks he can take 10 shots like 50 and come out with a 2-fake 
 And I got the scoop for the men hood 
 Said you had a suit sign on your head last time you was in the hood 
 Now you wanna front like you really stompin it 
 Boston, keep talkin' we gon' take you to Compton, nigga 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 I'ma teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 Let me teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 Watch me teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 You know I'll die for this G-Unit shit so what you sayin' 50? 
 I'ma teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 Let me teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 Watch me teach 'em 'bout playin' with me 
 You know I'll ride for this G-Unit shit till the fed's come get me
