(Verse one-young buck) 
 Walk through a nigga block, 2 glocks, 2 tecks, 2 2-3's 
 Give a nigga what he really want, when bitch niggas don't want beef 
 Bitch niggas don't know me, wait till a nigga get in range 
 Hate when a nigga wanna run his mouth, and live his life in pain 
 We ain't even used to this, talk and where the gun shots at? 
 Loose lips sank ships, y'all niggas didn't even pop back 
 Oh lord, I swore, if any muthafucka holla my name 
 I'm raw, spelled backwards, that's what I'm gon' bring 
 Banks, what a nigga think?, we ain't got guns 
 No troops, everything bulletproof, sniper's layin' down on the roof 
 Stash box in the coupe nigga, I'm tellin' you the truth nigga 
 Raise them lil bitty boys, all they do is come shoot niggas 
 Black gloves, black mask 
 Black shirt, black pants 
 Blue steel, blue vest 
 He dead, you next 
 Put a couple holes in a hoe 
 Let a nigga know he 'bout to go 
 Put the pump right to his throat 
 Bet he won't talk no more 
 Black gloves, black mask 
 Black shirt, black pants 
 Blue steel, blue vest 
 He dead, you next 
 Black gloves, black mask 
 Black shirt, black pants 
 Blue steel, blue vest 
 He dead, you next 
 (Verse two-young buck) 
 I'm commin', through the front door, mask on, let's ride 
 Everybody on the muthafuckin floor, soon as a nigga get inside 
 My hood, my click, your wife, my bitch 
 Show a nigga that you really love him, set him up to hit a good lick 
 Cops comin', I'm not runnin', if I do die, don't cry 
 I haven't planned on stayin' long anyway, I ain't gon' lie 
 Wonder why I still got bricks, wonder why I still got clips 
 'Cause ain't a damn thing changed, ever since young buck got rich 
 Are ya ready for the outcome, why you walkin' 'round without a gun 
 Shit real, till a nigga get killed, then you wanna run and get one 
 Fuck that! I'm callin' out names, ja rule, y'all lose 
 I don't even care how it started, fuck me?, fuck you! 
 Wait till yayo get home, we gon' really get these niggas gone 
 But for now nigga, hold on, I'm'a show you how to break a bone 
 Cashville, tennekee nigga!, we thug you knew it 
 New york, we here, for life, g-unit! 
 Black gloves, black mask 
 Black shirt, black pants 
 Blue steel, blue vest 
 He dead, you next 
 Black gloves, black mask 
 Black shirt, black pants 
 Blue steel, blue vest 
 He dead, you next 
 (Outro-50 cent) 
 Yeah, young buck nigga, cashville, tennessee nigga 
 From your hood to my hood muthafucka, new york city nigga, haha 
 Real shit nigga, it's all good nigga, haha, it's all hood nigga
