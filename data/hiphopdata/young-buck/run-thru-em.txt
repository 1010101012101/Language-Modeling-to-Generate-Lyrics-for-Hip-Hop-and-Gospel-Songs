Got Money 
 If you got money put yo hood up 
 If you don't owe nobody shit, put yo hood up 
 If you buyin' your own bird, put yo hood up 
 Whatchu' mean if you tryna' buy the hog 
 Credit card machines I could swipe a nigga card 
 Ho get on your job 
 You always in the club 
 Talkin' 'bout you ballin but we know you fucked up 
 Ice on my neck got me lookin' at myself 
 Got me throwin' up my hood make you wanna two step 
 And some 28 inches on a black lex truck 
 A bad yellow bitch and we both X'd up 
 In the club like... 
 Broke niggaz to the back 
 Rich niggaz where you at? 
 Gimme that 
 Ten Thousand dollar stack 
 And I'm a Run right through em 
 (I gotta) Run right through em 
 (You know I) Run right through em 
 (I bet I) Run right through em

 From my shirt to my jeans

 (You know I) Run right through em

 I smell like money and I talk that shit 
 Gimme a couple birds 
 I give you what's on my wrist 
 I'm tryna' find a bitch and put some diamonds on her hand 
 Her baby daddy can't, I just do it 'cause I can 
 Patron in my cup got me feelin' fucked up 
 Got 'em all on my nuts 'cause I got a million bucks 
 You can't move it like I do 
 I'm the man, who are you? 
 See your money runnin' out 
 Bitch you damn near through 
 I'm in the club like... 
 Broke niggaz to the back 
 Rich niggaz where you at?

 Everybody know that I got it for the low 
 Ain't fuckin' wit those niggaz who ain't got it no mo' 
 See ain't nothin' old but a nigga' bank roll 
 (I stay Fly-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-i) from my head to my toe 
 The million dollar man, call me Ted DiBiase 
 The tag on the 'rarri so don't ask me what it cost me 
 Toilet bowl seats 'cause I know that I'm the shit 
 Keep some extra people make it rain in this bitch 
 And this lil' blue pill got me throwin' gang signs 
 Got me showin off my nine 
 Got me losin' my mind 
 Go 'n' roll somethin' up 
 I'm a hit it till its gone 
 If ya' weed ain't strong, then ya' money ain't long.
