 Half a slab and I got that bird

 What you gon' do you if you get you a bird? 
 I'm a rebuild these projects 
 Get my kids and put em' through college 
 Even though they got me trnya' kick knowledge 
 I'm a get a vest too lets be honest 
 I seen death in the hood 
 Left in the hood 
 Fuck these niggas by myself in the hood 
 Would have helped if I could 
 But these ain't keepin' it real like a real nigga should 
 Watch a real nigga do it 
 I get to it 
 I just knew it 
 The dope jumped back 
 Put about a ounce a soda on top a the yola 
 Let the white run with it if they pull me over 
 I speed till I blow the motor 
 This dat dro niggas know the odor 
 Send me to jail they gon' make my bail 
 Yeah I'm talkin' 'bout the show promoters 
 28 grams, better keep flippin 
 9 o's for the chicken 
 When I cook up not one missin' 
 Uh oh! I'm on a mission 
 Told these ho's but they didn't listen 
 Ten-a-key timepiece time is tickin 
 I know I told y'all that I was quittin 
 Little Jimmy tell 'em I was kiddin'

 What you gon' do you if you get you a bird? 
 Play with my money nigga play with ya life 
 Tryna kill me but ya ain't all right 
 I got so many wanna hate on me 
 But then look for buck when they tank on E 
 All this ice they think its free 
 Like I ain't come from the D-I-R-T 
 Half a my niggas never gon see the streets 
 All we say now is R.I.P 
 Far as I see this all I got 
 My own man nobody don't call the shots 
 You not nowhere close to the top 
 Fuck how long you been on this block 
 Go nigga run ya'self hot 
 Tryna keep up with me and my drop 
 That's why its just me and my glock 
 Run up on me and see if I pop 
 Keep hatin' me see if I stop 
 It's like you the water and I'm the pot 
 I shake ya harder ya turn to rock 
 I break ya down and then raid the block 
 When ya all get through I'm a always do what I got to 
 Homie with or without you 
 I'm a blow back to back and keep big old stacks 
 Just in case I gotta throw one at you 
 Let's get money 
 Never Lookin' Back when I get me a bird
