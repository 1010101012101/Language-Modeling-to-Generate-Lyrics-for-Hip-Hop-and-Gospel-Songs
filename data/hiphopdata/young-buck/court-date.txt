True, I'm in the hood like you 
 Same hunk of pains everyone go through 
 I'm just gettin' it, do what I do 
 I'm hated by many, and loved by few 
 Naw, You don't even have a clue what kind of bills is due 
 The boys in blue, niggaz try to kill me too 
 So I hustle, I hustle, I hustle, You can' stop my hustle 
 My bonds been paid, Bitch made niggaz get outa the way 
 These Fuck boys thought I wasn't gettin' out today 
 Okay, knock knock open up (pow pow) Woke 'em up, 
 Woke him up, like motherfucker you done told him, What! 
 DEA go a search warrant what I did? 
 Roughed my bitch up, And put the cuffs on my kids 
 Mayne, Everybody actin' like they didn't say nothin' 
 Ye, you like from your lyin', my court dates comin' 
 My court dates comin' [x4] 
 The Days gettin' shorter my nights gettin' longer 
 Life is a bitch, But I love this hoe, so I'm on her 
 My lawyer need money, or he say he ain't commin' 
 And I'm thinkin' bout runnin', but they still got my woman 
 If you ain't did nothin', sittin' in cell six, 
 She ain't ever seen nothin', so she couldn't tell shit 
 Tryin' to take my kids, they say the parents aren't fit 
 What they found ain't no tellin' what the parents might get 
 But I tell 'em like this, I was sellin dem bricks 
 Puttin' mine through school, Fuck what I'm wearin' on my wrist 
 Now my court date commin', of cours their Wonderin 
 If I'm really goin' to show up, for one till the roll up 
 My brains sayin' hold up, my body sayin' go 
 Get it over with, don't play with dem white folks 
 So I hustle, I hustle, I hustle, You can' stop my hustle 
 My court dates comin' [x4] 
 In twenty-four hours, my dreams is devoured 
 The DA hate me, and the judge is a coward 
 My house paid for, my kids got allowance 
 My mama all good, I got somethin' to be proud of 
 So ima lay it down, do it on my own when I'm wrong 
 Fuck my hoes, I'll get at 'em when I'm home 
 'Cause I hustle, I hustle, so fuck you, fuck you 
 Never loved her, never did trust you 
 Fuckin' up the pain, call a nigga name up 
 Phone just rang, I answered you hang up 
 The hallway full of spectators, 
 Black and whit people reading over court papers 
 My name gets called, I'm prepared for it all 
 Nowhere to sit the court room to small 
 I hear by law, I order you to come tomorrow 
 My lawyer put it off, so that means that... 
 My court dates comin' [x4]
