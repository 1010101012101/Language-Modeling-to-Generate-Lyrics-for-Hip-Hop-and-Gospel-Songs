Young Buck: 
 Aiyo, hip hop is a beautiful thing 
 Until somebody die ha ha ha 
 Vocal Sample: 
 Daydreams, I fell asleep beneath the flowers 
 For a couple of hours 
 On a beautiful day 
 Daydreams, I fell asleep beneath the flowers 
 For a couple of hours 
 Such a beautiful day 
 Daydreams, I fell asleep beneath the flowers 
 For a couple of hours 
 On a beautiful day 
 Daydreams, I fell asleep beneath the flowers 
 For a couple of hours 
 Such a beautiful day 
 Young Buck: 
 G Unit! South 
 Yeah 
 I got this niggas 
 I'm back 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 It's like everybody mad in hip hop 
 They sad when they get hot 
 Go broke and stay scared to grab that Zip Lock 
 Election time comin' the dope goin' up 
 Niggas put you out the game man you ain't showin' up 
 Got to rob Little Johnny 
 For his quarter bird money 
 Ever since I put him on it's like I ain't heard from him 
 And they raided the number house 
 That's when I felt lucky 
 Should've played my little girl's birthday but fuck it 
 It's a cold world 
 50 Cent: 
 Aiyo pull that back man 
 Aiyo play that again man 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Hey, how you work how you work this? 
 Turn the knob 
 Turn the music up 
 Turn it up so they can hear it louder out there

 That's when I felt lucky 
 Should've played my little girl's birthday but fuck it 
 It's a cold world 
 That's why my old girl 
 Called the police and told 'em that I sold furl 
 Gave up Earl and Sherl 
 And gave life to Durl 
 So could you hand me that can I think I'm 'gon hurl 
 Cause you ain't ever had to steal water from your neighbor's house 
 Or pay Chris The Clown to perform when your cable out 
 Now I'm parked in the projects waitin' on 50 
 Everytime I hop in the back of the Bentley... 
 It's like I start to
