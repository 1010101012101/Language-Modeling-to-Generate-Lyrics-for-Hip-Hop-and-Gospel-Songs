(Feat. Sosa and Hi C) 
 Young Buck: 
 Yeah 
 Money gettin' niggas 'gon love this 
 Broke niggas 'gon hate it 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Hate me, love me, still I'm a boss 
 Brand new coupe didn't take the tag off 
 Entre-po nigga 
 Give some mo' nigga 
 Military mind back down from no nigga 
 Where did you go nigga? 
 I could make it rain 
 With some hundred dollar bills or a hundred of them things 
 Candy apple green, no tints, no chrome 
 Catch me in the streets till six in the morn 
 (Verse 2: Sosa) 
 I keep one in the hone and a gun on my hip 
 Just called my phone, you want somethin' to sniff? 
 19.5 you want one of them bricks 
 Like a Subway combo come with them chips 
 And I show no love when it come to a bitch 
 She just want me cause my coke six hundred and six 
 Yeah, this what you call a dope man bitch 
 But I don't tell her nothin' cause these hos ain't shit 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense 
 Dope man money with a dope man bitch 
 Big ballin' baby my whole clique rich 
 Big ballin' baby I know we the shit 
 If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense 
 Dope man money with a dope man bitch 
 Big ballin' baby my whole clique rich 
 Big ballin' baby I know we the shit 
 (Verse 3: Hi-C) 
 See I lick coke, breathe in hydro 
 Look like green money nigga I know 
 I ride slow 
 With the .40 cal I know 
 Smokin' on that purple haze shit till my eyes low 
 My bitch got nine Os for the five four 
 She'll let the nine go 
 Oh yeah that's high ho 
 My ho 
 Yeah a dope man bitch 
 If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense 
 (Verse 4: Sosa) 
 The '65 look good enough to drink 
 Grey Goose seats with the cranberry paint 
 Y'all wish I could sell coke forever but I can't 
 Just one more load and I'm fuckin' with real estate 
 I've been up for a week, from the first to the eighth 
 Peicin' out grams and I still got the weight 
 If I get too tired pop a pill I'm straight 
 I'll show you how to fit a couple mill in the safe 
 G Unit South 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense 
 Dope man money with a dope man bitch 
 Big ballin' baby my whole clique rich 
 Big ballin' baby I know we the shit 
 If it don't make dollars then it don't make sense 
 Dope man money with a dope man bitch 
 Big ballin' baby my whole clique rich 
 Big ballin' baby I know we the shit 
 Young Buck: 
 Put your money in the air 
 Put your money in the air 
 Ballin' baby 
 Ballin' baby 
 We gettin' money over here 
 They gettin' money over there 
 What up All Star?
