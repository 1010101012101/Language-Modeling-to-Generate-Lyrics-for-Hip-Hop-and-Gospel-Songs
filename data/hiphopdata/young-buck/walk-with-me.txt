 G-unit! 
 (Stat quo)

 (Stat quo) 
 Ya understand me nigga? 
 (Young buck) 
 Aye nigga, they say we the new kings of the south 
 (Stat quo) 
 They say that 
 (Young buck) 
 Atl to cashville... damn! 
 (Verse one-young buck) 
 I've been patiently waitin' to blow 
 But still on the block with the k and the coke 
 See the Mexican's love me, they tell me keep on doin' it homes 
 They never seen a nigga go get it and bring it back home 
 I don't want out of them zones, I want the whole thing, g-unit! 
 We done started our own game, we ain't playin' no games 
 Duck tape 'em and take 'em to the hood 
 Don't get no blood on my leather and wood 
 Make it look good for the block 
 I be puttin' in my work, handlin' my business 
 I been on my knees, askin' my homeboys who did this? 
 So fuck that!, that's why I bust back 
 Spit my bars, get off tour, then go and cook crack 
 Look at me now bitch, you don't know how rich 
 Lloyd banks, yayo, 50 cent, game nigga, or I'll get 
 Solute a soldier when you see me 
 And I ain't one of those niggas out here stuntin' for TV 
 I gotta keep it gangsta 
 (Chorus-young buck) 
 Now I can show you how to put in work, and move them birds 
 I do that dirt, now all my real niggas, walk with me (yeah) 
 Just walk with me (yeah), walk with me (yeah), c'mon walk with me (yeah) 
 Now I can show you how to put in work, and move them birds 
 I do that dirt, now all my real niggas, walk with me (yeah) 
 Just walk with me (yeah), walk with me (yeah), c'mon walk with me (yeah) 
 (Verse two-stat quo) 
 Yeah, the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin' 
 Wont stop till he busts his kneel in, my cats conceilin' 
 Bad bitches I'm drillin, he's sittin' on millions 
 Fuck what you feelin', violate my space, bare witness the killin' 
 Stat'll dog, for a dollar 'cause he known to finish 
 My account resembles spandex, how they stretch 
 Faggots play like a razor step, when the ak's and teck's show up 
 They so quick to hoe up, but hold up 
 When the clamp has appeared they show up 
 Sayin' that snitch song shit, you lil' puss ass bitch 
 Beg tanya lita how she get ya ass whiped 
 Why hustle at all, when you hustle backwards 
 Mo' money I get, mo' niggas be hatin' 
 I light fire to ya ass, they be callin' ya Satan 
 Gmm my organization, my obligation is to spit that shit 
 'Cause the streets is waitin', yah 
 (Chorus-young buck) 
 Now I can show you how to put in work, and move them birds 
 I do that dirt, now all my real niggas, walk with me (yeah) 
 Just walk with me (yeah), walk with me (yeah), c'mon walk with me (yeah) 
 Now I can show you how to put in work, and move them birds 
 I do that dirt, now all my real niggas, walk with me (yeah) 
 Just walk with me (yeah), walk with me (yeah), c'mon walk with me (yeah) 
 (Verse three-young buck) 
 I'm showin' no love to these cowards, I don't give a fuck 
 Shady/aftermath/g-unit we'll hit you up 
 Country as I wanna be, but gangsta as they come 
 Loose lips sank ships, snitches die where I'm from 
 Get ya gun off safety, if ya plan on livin' 
 Don't make me cock it and pop it, I'll knock your head off with it 
 Yeah I've said I've did it, 'cause I did, and I'm doin' it 
 Done came too far to let you bitch niggas ruin it 
 (Verse four-stat quo) 
 Yeah, every word I utter, is simply octaine 
 I keeps it gunnin' and ya boy's the boss may'ne 
 The main thing, keep the main thing, the main thing 
 Stack cheese, grip grain, spit hotter than hot wing 
 Niggas claimin' they hard, we know you square 
 Try to creep gun's like ties, I keep a spare 
 Save them games for the arcade, ain't no scare 
 And we prepared for problems, 'cause we right here (yeah) 
 (Chorus-young buck) 
 Now I can show you how to put in work, and move them birds 
 I do that dirt, now all my real niggas, walk with me (yeah) 
 Just walk with me (yeah), walk with me (yeah), c'mon walk with me (yeah) 
 Now I can show you how to put in work, and move them birds 
 I do that dirt, now all my real niggas, walk with me (yeah) 
 Just walk with me (yeah), walk with me (yeah), c'mon walk with me (yeah)
