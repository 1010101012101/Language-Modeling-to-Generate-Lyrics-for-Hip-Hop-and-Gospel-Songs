[Chorus](Sharron Sanders) 
 You might see my riims spiiinin 
 And all this big time and shinin' 
 I'm postin up tonight 
 Let's get this money 
 Let's get this money 
 Let's get this money 
 Let's get this money 
 (Young Buck) 
 I'm on my grind ain't no clubbin for me, 
 Cause lil groupie ass hoes mean nothin' to me 
 I like chinchilla furs, cars and crocidiles 
 Similiar to jigga but my own lifestyle 
 I got a child so I ant really 'bout no games 
 I've been all around the world and its al the same 
 If you ain't got monye you dam near dead 
 So we post on the block till we get us some bread 
 I ain't been home in 3 days or change my clothes, 
 But I can reach in my pocket pull out a bankroll 
 A ballah baby I don't love these hoes 
 I hustle Monday through Sunday 
 My shop neva close 
 That's why you see the ice on them chrome 24's 
 'Cause I'm in the traphouse while 50 doin' shows 
 Love for the rap game but live for the streets 
 What would you do if you was gettin' it cheap 
 You might see my riiims spiiinin 
 And all this big time and shinin' 
 I'm postin up tonight 
 Let's get this money 
 Let's get this money 
 Let's get this money 
 Let's get this money 
 (Young Buck) 
 Brin it back if you takin' to long 
 I'm trying ot flip minds quick see my patience is gone 
 Let the lil homies take my cars to the club 
 And ima post right here, come show me some love 
 I got 2 for 1's cause, 3 for the twenty 
 I'm takin' dimes, pennies or whatever that you give me 
 Gotta make it home so I'm checkin' my rearview 
 These rappers ain't trappin 
 For real I still do 
 Captain of ship or ther kernal of the tank 
 Whatever that you cal me in money in da bank 
 Just playin' my position liike a shoulder do 
 And it ain't no tellin' what I sold to you 
 I told my girl hold on I'm tryin' to get a lil bigga 
 You ain't feelin' that go find another nigga 
 A money go-getter you gotta love me 
 Underground king like pimp c and bun b 
 You might see my riiims spiiinin 
 And all this big time and shinin' 
 I'm postin up tonight 
 Let's get this money 
 Let's get this money 
 Let's get this money 
 Let's get this money
