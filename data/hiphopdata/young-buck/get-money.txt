 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Fresh out the trap I got a hundred grand on me 
 And I'm a make it rain I'm the fuckin' man homey 
 Do ya thang (do ya thang) 
 Get out my way 
 I got the pills, got the weed got the yay 
 The Maybach Benz, no rims and the windows is tinted 
 I never drive this bitch I just get head in it 
 I ain't fuckin' with the stick shift automatic Lamborghini 
 Drop top Phantom and the tags say: "I know you see me ballin'" 
 Hoggin' up the third lane 
 Yeah I got that work so who the real Birdman? 
 Holla back 
 We flippin' powder packs 
 And if you want this stack 
 Then shorty swallow that 
 You know my Impala black 
 The Chevy signs in the seats 
 Plus I got my strap and you can find me in the streets 
 First I check my trap then I count my gees 
 Then I clean my whip y'all know where I be

 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 What you thought this was and who you think I am? 
 I get that block money I just started paying Uncle Sam 
 Flip the work, take the profit, and go jakk it off 
 Canarie Yellow Cadillac and it match my cross 
 A Dirty South boss I get it before it come out 
 I put it on the highway and fill up before I run out 
 I leave 'em with they tongue out 
 Stop and get 'em crunk 
 Let the hos hear my motor and my mama hit the blunt 
 In the projects you can catch me parked in the front 
 My niggas buy a brick a day and a Chevy every month 
 We don't want to get away we want to get our shine on 
 So worry about your own hood and leave mine alone 
 The man of the city 
 I candy paint a Hemi 
 Then I give it to my homies and go buy another Bentley 
 You want to ride with me? then go and hit me up 
 Make sure you're ready I'm a come through and pick you up
