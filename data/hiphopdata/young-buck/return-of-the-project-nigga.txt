Ayo wattup! 
 If I should die, before I wake... I pray to the Lord 
 Alot of shit goin' down out here 
 But I ain't going nowhere... holla when you see me! 
 The return of the project nigga 
 100 bricks strong and my pockets bigger 
 Still holdin' the throne, it's too late to hate me 
 Hell, I'm Ca$hvilles own in a black Mercedes 
 TV's in this bitch, I don't how to turn 'em on 
 I just bought this muthafucka and shipped it home 
 In traffic we smokin', sun-roof closed 
 Hoes pullin up like "oh there he go!" 
 Ain't nobody on that beef shit 
 It's too many mexicans with the cheap bricks 
 Peep this, all you need is a big heart 
 A quarter bird, that's like givin' you a kick start 
 You done heard 'bout the flex that's the undercovers 
 Ridin' 'round, jumpin' out, searchin muthafuckas 
 Hey, so we open at 9 and we close at 5 
 Keep a nigga in a ride, 'case I close my eyes 
 I won't stop till they kill me 
 Better yet till the whole world feel me 
 Let me tell you bout this town where I come from 
 Ca$ville, Ten-a-key look what I done 
 Nigga see me in the map and the public love it 
 Police in the streets like nah fuck it 
 It's me against the government, they don't know how to take me 
 They done see they tape and they think I'm crazy 
 Shittin at my birthday bash 
 Well officer Calvin Hulay, u can kiss my cass 
 I strap on that 5-2 
 You on that racist shit and I'm a black dude 
 Even took my liscence and say they suspend it 
 But come to find out that that bitch pretended 
 I dropped a thug rap platinum album in the 'ville 
 So somebody please tell that coward who I is, BITCH 
 It's like, I'm the first one 
 But I ain't the only one, to holla Ca$hville muthafuckas
