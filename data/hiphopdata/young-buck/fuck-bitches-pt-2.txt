Young buck: 
 Yeah, get money! 
 You niggas know what it is 
 Ah man you know I don't give a fuck about a bitch 
 I'm gettin' money 
 (Chorus: young buck) 
 I got no time to chase that bitch 
 I'm on my grind I flip them bricks 
 Pimp that ho till she get me rich 
 Hustlin' it now didn't give me shit 
 (Verse 1: young buck) 
 I took that work and cooked that coke 
 Rolled that blunt and inhaled that smoke 
 We waited outside till they all came out 
 Ran up on 'em with them big thangs out 
 Takin' niggas' chains in the middle of the street 
 Bust a couple of shots get away on feet 
 Back to the hood make the hos put in work 
 Walk that block with a byrd in your purse 
 Ho turn that trick bitch break that nigga 
 You know daddy don't like his bank roll little 
 Buy that car homie bust your guns 
 Fuck them boys nigga where you from? 
 Put ice on your clique 
 Not ice on a bitch 
 Real niggas take my advice in this shit 
 Get that bread 
 Nigga watch them feds 
 First nigga snitch better bust his head 
 (Chorus: young buck) 
 I got no time to chase that bitch 
 I'm on my grind I flip them bricks 
 Pimp that ho till she get me rich 
 Hustlin' it now didn't give me shit 
 Young buck: 
 For real nigga 
 Some of you niggas out here hustlin' for these hos 
 Your bitch rims bigger than yours man 
 What kind of shit is that? 
 Yous a sucker for love nigga 
 Get the fuck out the club ho 
 Yeah, niggas know what it is 
 G unit young buck 
 Pimpin', ca$hville ten-a-key nigga 
 Holla back 
 Na, I'm still lookin' for a new york ho, where she at? yeah
