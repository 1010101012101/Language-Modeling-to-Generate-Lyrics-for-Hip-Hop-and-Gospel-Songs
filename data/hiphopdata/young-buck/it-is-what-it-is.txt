Young Buck: 
 Give me some shotgun shells 
 Young Buck, 
 Buck 'em down motherfucker lets go 
 Ha ha ha 
 Yeah 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 I got the weight of the world on my shoulders and I love it 
 The Bubble Kush got me I can't get enough of it 
 I'm thuggin' in public 
 Bustin' like fuck it 
 They say I'm the reason my neighborhoods corrupted 
 Because I came from nothin' 
 Wouldn't change for nothin' 
 Started swingin' my chopper nigga just aim for somethin' 
 I need a cup of Grey Goose 
 Cause the renegade's loose 
 Leave your brains in your coupe 
 When the twenty gauge shoot 
 Tell the truth 
 That nigga 50 know what he got 
 The rap game ain't seen nothin' like this since Pac 
 I'm just breakin' down birds till my album drop 
 Back and forth to the A where I set up shop 
 Cruisin' down the street it must be around two o'clock 
 They done pulled me over and just found two Glocks 
 But I'm straight you know we got a license for that 
 So give me my ticket and hand my strap right back 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 I'm okay in the A 
 I'm a stay in the A 
 Got the Yay in the A 
 So I'm good anyway 
 But I live in the 'Ville 
 And I'm still in the 'Ville 
 Niggas know I keep it real 
 So it is what it is 
 I'm okay in the A 
 I'm a stay in the A 
 Got the Yay in the A 
 So I'm good anyway 
 But I live in the 'Ville 
 And I'm still in the 'Ville 
 Niggas know I keep it real 
 So it is what it is 
 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 God damn it 
 I don't understand it 
 If I was you I wouldn't take life for granted 
 Got to grind 
 I started from the back of the line 
 And waited my turn so now it's my time 
 With a pistol grip pump yeah it's all mine 
 Give your boy two months get rich or die tryin' 
 If I die tonight 
 Just get high as a kite 
 Tell my mama and my little girl I'm all right 
 Buck The World! 
 Throw the clip up 
 I'm 'gon hit up 
 Nigga git up 
 If you with us 
 'Cause they know I know they want to kill us 
 Dope dealers 
 Cop killers 
 Sac stealers 
 Black Gorillas 
 The more Macs they give us 
 They got to deal with us 
 I'm a soldier 
 Never made it past the eight grade 
 But I could make half a million in eight days 
 So when I holla: "Hey" 
 Do it the same way 
 It ain't about where your from its about how you stay 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 I'm okay in the A 
 I'm a stay in the A 
 Got the Yay in the A 
 So I'm good anyway 
 But I live in the 'Ville 
 And I'm still in the 'Ville 
 Niggas know I keep it real 
 So it is what it is 
 I'm okay in the A 
 I'm a stay in the A 
 Got the Yay in the A 
 So I'm good anyway 
 But I live in the 'Ville 
 And I'm still in the 'Ville 
 Niggas know I keep it real 
 So it is what it is 
 Young Buck:
