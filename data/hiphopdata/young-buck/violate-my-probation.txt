 They pulled me over on my high speed chasin 
 Give me a light, and let me get my mind right 
 I ain't got to piss this week nigga I'm tight 
 That's wha I'm talkin' bout 
 Two hits of this shit'll have yo ass fallin' out 
 I'm in my zone and ain't nobody up to drive me home 
 All my homies already gone they left me on my own 
 My seat pushed back let me straighten up my act 
 They just let me out the pen and I ain't goin' back 
 I said I wouldn't smoke no more 
 But they keep passin weed to me 
 They say that that's the fire so I need to see 
 I hope I don't violate my probation, probation

 Day to day duckin homicides 
 Dope money, guns in my mothafuckin system hoe

 For that granddaddy purp, cali kush and sour dies
