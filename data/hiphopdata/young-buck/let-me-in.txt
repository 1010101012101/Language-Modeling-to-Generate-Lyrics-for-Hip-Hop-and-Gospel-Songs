(Intro-50 cent) 
 Yeah, Its 50 cent, Young Buck 
 G-g-g-g-g-G-UNIT! 
 We keep the club jumpin' from beginning to the end 
 Go shawty, we back up in this bitch again 
 We party, harder than you can imagine 
 You can run wit losers, or run wit winners and win 
 (Verse 1-Young Buck) 
 I feel attention when I walk in the club 
 G-unit to the socks, bitches all on a thug 
 Gimme a henny on the rocks, and a bottle of bub 
 I don't need security, Dis Four-Nickel enough 
 I came to ball wit y'all, buy out the bar and all 
 So bitches call ya hoes, n niggaz call ya dogs (I'm here) 
 If you love ya wife keep her at home tonight 
 She might neva come home again nigga, aight! 
 Teeth, neck, wrists all lights my lifes like 
 Ridin' in Ca$hville and runnin' all stop lights 
 Homie is that real, I pray I keep livin' 
 My momma jus hadda dream of seein me in prison (Damn) 
 My daddys a dope feind, n I don't really miss him (Fuck!) 
 Ain't seen him in 10 years n a nigga still livin' 
 Tha same ol' 2 step we move to a rhythm

 (Verse 2-Young Buck) 
 I know I'm sinnin but I'm winnin' at tha same time 
 Took a couple shots from sum niggas tryin' ta take mine 
 I'm back on tha block, wit a choppa n a tech nine 
 Niggaz shootin cops 'n' the hood runnin' stop signs 
 G-UNIT, The Game! We doin' wat tha thugs do 
 GD's, Vice Lords, Crips 'n' the Bloodz too 
 Move lemme come through 
 Ain't a pair of handcuffs, can hold me 
 I'm ridin' in the ol' school listenin to some oldies 
 My goals be shinin, Them hoes be cryin 
 They handle of my 45 outlined in diamonds 
 Just left Ca$hville, bout to fly to Miami 
 Helpin Yayo watchin Eminem perform at the Grammys 
 Niggaz like Eric Benet, prolly can't stand me 
 I know money will make Halle Berry come out her panties 
 Bitch!

 I know you gonna let me shine 'n' get mine

 Teach em' how to stunt, teach em' how to count stacks (yeah) 
 Now where ya hood at? Buck If you want to, we 50 deep up in here watchu gonna do 
 Who want beef, I ain't come for no name callin 
 Don't be mad 'cause we is 'n' you ain't ballin' (get money) 
 Gettin' money is my motto for you broke folks 
 Can't spend ya whole life payin' on a car note 
 It's all right if you still on the block boy 
 See imma cold young thug, not a hot boy 
 You know I do this for the streets, n my peeps thas behind bars 
 As soon as they come home, I'll go 'n' buy them all cars 
 Young Buck!
