Young Buck: 
 Get bank and live 
 Get bank and live 
 Get bank and live 
 Get bank and live 
 Get bank and live 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 What your pockets like? 
 Put it out and get it right 
 I bought my dope by bag I ain't runnin' out tonight 
 Where your money at nigga? 
 Where your money at ho? 
 Where your money at nigga? 
 Where your money at ho? 
 What your pockets like? 
 Put it out and get it right 
 I bought my dope by bag I ain't runnin' out tonight 
 Where your money at nigga? 
 Where your money at ho? 
 Where your money at nigga? 
 Where your money at ho? 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Get bank and live man lets find out 
 Now I'm a start it off 'cause I'm pullin' mines out 
 Got the hundreds on top and the fiftys on bottom 
 I'm throwin' money at the biggest baller when I spot him 
 I only want the bad bitches 
 No fat bitches 
 My homie Don Juan he'll be glad to hit ya 
 Do your dance shorty, turn around let me see it 
 Can it bounce for me well make a nigga want to eat it 
 It's that dope boy money it don't ever run out 
 When I'm finished throwin' this I pull the next one out 
 Catch up with me if you broke be gone 
 You can't smoke what we smokin' or drink what we on 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 What your pockets like? 
 Put it out and get it right 
 I bought my dope by bag I ain't runnin' out tonight 
 Where your money at nigga? 
 Where your money at ho? 
 Where your money at nigga? 
 Where your money at ho? 
 What your pockets like? 
 Put it out and get it right 
 I bought my dope by bag I ain't runnin' out tonight 
 Where your money at nigga? 
 Where your money at ho? 
 Where your money at nigga? 
 Where your money at ho? 
 LeBron James: 
 I got a very special thanks to all the Sada Pops out there in the land 
 Y'all keep it comin' 
 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 I smell like money, get like me I'm a get to the money 
 The trap where I be 
 Got some hos in they Gucci pumps walkin' it out 
 And my whole crew caked up that's what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 Make it rain on 'em 
 Make it rain on 'em 
 I know they hate me that's why I do my thing on 'em 
 I swing my chain on 'em 
 And flip the caine on 'em 
 The Phantom and the Ferrari they got my name on 'em 
 I know they ain't want it 
 I pop a rubberband 
 I got a big bank roll in the other hand 
 I make 'em understand 
 And then come again 
 Cause around here I'm the motherfuckin' man 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 What your pockets like? 
 Put it out and get it right 
 I bought my dope by bag I ain't runnin' out tonight 
 Where your money at nigga? 
 Where your money at ho? 
 Where your money at nigga? 
 Where your money at ho? 
 What your pockets like? 
 Put it out and get it right 
 I bought my dope by bag I ain't runnin' out tonight 
 Where your money at nigga? 
 Where your money at ho? 
 Where your money at nigga? 
 Where your money at ho?
