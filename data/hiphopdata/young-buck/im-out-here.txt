(INTRO: Talking) 
 What everybody looking at me for 
 I mean 
 I'm out here just like you nigga 
 Shit 
 You ain't got shit 
 I ain't got shit 
 That don't mean we ain't the shit 
 Rain pours when I open up the Range doors 
 The young boys slang caine on they front porch 
 Show 'em love, Let 'em know they ain't playin' with' 'em 
 Ya homies locked up 
 You might be stayin' with' 'em 
 Act like you don't know they hate us 
 They make us tax payers 
 And then Section 8 us 
 White lady but she had a black baby 
 A nigga fell in love and we look at her crazy 
 We all got guns 
 And so do Dick Cheney 
 They trick on hoes 
 I make my bitch pay me 
 These are the things that they scream 
 As I lean to the left by myself with no team 
 Tell the kids to go to school 
 They tell me they ain't breakin' no rules 
 'Cause when the bell rings then it's back to no food 
 They have no clue what we goin' through 
 You need a 100 to fill up what I'm supposed to do 
 Nigga 
 You too 
 You in my ear but it's money out here 
 And I'm always here 
 When none of y'all here 
 Which one of y'all scared 
 (Which one of y'all scared) 
 OK! 
 Cause you said let's get this bread and I did 
 Shit I wanna do it big 
 And I just can't wait 
 So you gotta live with the decisions that you make 
 I'm gettin' cake 
 Let 'em hate 
 I'm a elevate 
 I sold my soul to the streets playa 
 It's too late 
 Sun rise 
 Gun fires 
 And another dies 
 Mother cries 
 Brother rides 
 Now it's two lives 
 You and I both know that that was suicide 
 Same shit would'a happened if you'da died 
 Thirty guns 
 Fifty deep 
 Ten niggas shootin' 
 O.G.'s keep your eyes on who you recrutin' 
 Back then they was ridin' and lootin' 
 You looking at the 2000 Huey P. Newton 
 True disciple 
 Swag like a I'll rookie 
 Ain't heard it like this since Pac 
 I might spook 'em 
 Chosen 
 You try'na be chosen 
 It's a white man's world 
 If we win, we losin' 
 Abusin' your blessin' 
 I'm givin' you a lesson 
 But it's goin' in the right ear and out the left one 
 I tell the kids education is the key 
 Then a student in Virginia goes on a killin' spree 
 Look at me 
 You in my ear but it's money out here 
 And I'm always here 
 When none of y'all here 
 Which one of y'all scared 
 (Which one of y'all scared) 
 OK! 
 'Cause you said let's get this bread and I did 
 Shit I wanna do it big 
 And I just can't wait 
 So you gotta live with the decisions that you make 
 I'm gettin' cake 
 Let 'em hate 
 I'm a elevate 
 I sold my soul to the streets playa 
 It's too late 
 (OUTRO: Talking) 
 Y'all know what to do right 
 Take care of what you got homie 
 I mean 
 You never know what you got till it's gone right 
 Do what you gotta do man 
 Support you and yours 
 God giveth 
 God taketh away 
 Young Buck!
