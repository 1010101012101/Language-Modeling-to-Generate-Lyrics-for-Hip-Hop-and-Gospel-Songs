(Jazze Pha) 
 Ladies and gentlemen! 
 (Bridge-Young Buck x2) 
 I got my pistol in my pants, rocks in my draws 
 Holla woot woot homie if ya see them laws 
 (Chorus x2- Pimp C/ (Young Buck)) 
 I was standin on the corner slangin 'caine 
 (Tryna make it do what it do) 
 Just another young nigga havin' thangs made 
 (I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it, get it 
 (Verse- Young Buck) 
 I'm in the porche, no passenger 
 Feelin' like a filthy rich drug trafficer 
 See did nobody give me shit, I got my ass on that interstate 
 Made sure momma had food on that dinner plate 
 You not a boss if you ain't never took the loss 
 Some birds never lend it, but at least I didn't get caught 
 We don't even use scales niggas break off a brick 
 Whatever over is yours homie just take it and get 
 They gave Big Paul life, but I ain't thankin' about stoppin' 
 Cause soon he tried to quit, that's when the feds came got em 
 Ain't nothin' in my name and 50 cleaned up mine 
 I'm still paranoid though from what I left behind 
 Gotta put me some gloves on, they fuckin' wit buck now 
 Tryna slow me down, got me pissin in cups now 
 Three kings on a mission, see we got it for cheap 
 You put us together nigga, the streets finna eat 
 (Chorus x2- Pimp C/ (Young Buck)) 
 I was standin on the corner slangin 'caine 
 (Tryna make it do what it do) 
 Just another young nigga havin' thangs made 
 (I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it, get it 
 (Verse- T.I.) 
 Remember standin in the trap with 5 of 6 
 Over a vision and a pyrex 
 The nigga that ordered that quarter key ain't even came by yet 
 Blew a whole "O" of dro and I ain't even high yet 
 Spent 4 G's or more and I ain't even fly yet 
 Viper truck daily grill big wheel pimpin' 
 And they done gave us 20 mill, we a big deal pimpin' 
 Think we fakin what we spittin' better get real pimpin' 
 'Cause we still will kill, you just better chill pimpin' 
 Get it how you used to live it, keep on fakin for the women 
 The life we all make descions even with faces with collisions 
 Like me at 13 out with no supervision 
 Straight thug livin', bumpin prov drug dealing 
 Seen daily on the block, need yay we on the block 
 Keep the hatin' to yourself cause that AK be on the block 
 Dougy see me in V, me and K-T we in the drop 
 Went from standin the block with rocks standin on the top 
 (Chorus x2- Pimp C/ (Young Buck)) 
 I was standin on the corner slangin 'caine 
 (Tryna make it do what it do) 
 Just another young nigga havin' thangs made 
 (I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it, get it 
 (Verse- Young Jeezy) 
 1 for the bread and 2 for the blow 
 Mr. 17-5, you damn right its gon snow 
 Told ya I was gonn blow, Kinky-B said so 
 If not, back to chargin 600 for a "O" 
 Ain't nothin' to a G-shit, I been here before 
 Alleyhoop nigga, all you gotta do is score 
 I turned a brick into a label, nigga I'm a boss 
 Brush my teeth in the morning, I ain't even gotta floss 
 I sold 2 million records, and half a million "O's" 
 Add it all up, its 'bout a billion rocks 
 You can't be serious, you niggas ain't fo real 
 Just my ears alone is like a quarter a mill 
 Hit the body tap and blow half ya budget 
 I do it for the streets and muthafuckas love it 
 Just copped a new Bent, you know ya boy paid cash 
 That's thug motivation for ya muthafuckin ass, wassup 
 (Chorus x2- Pimp C/ (Young Buck)) 
 I was standin on the corner slangin 'caine 
 (Tryna make it do what it do) 
 Just another young nigga havin' thangs made 
 (I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it, get it 
 (Bridge-Young Buck x2) 
 I got my pistol in my pants, rocks in my draws 
 Holla woot woot homie if ya see them laws
