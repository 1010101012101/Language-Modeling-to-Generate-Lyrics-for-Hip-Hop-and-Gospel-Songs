I got oozis, and AK's of plenty 
 I got gadgets and grenades galore 
 Everynight I make sure that I'm ready 
 And prepare for war 
 I got ratchets, and Tec 9's, and Semi's 
 Automatics and shotguns galore 
 If you fuck with me make sure your ready 
 And prepare for war 
 I got a heart like 50, and a gun big as Biggie 
 Some old heads hatin' and some young niggas with me 
 Put a beam on a 12 gauge, buck, shots spread 
 I can aim for your legs, and hit you in your head 
 Like a soldier we sleep with our eyes open 
 We ride 4 deep and we trust no one 
 Heres the plan, soon as we finish shootin up ya man 
 We gonn' take it there, and shoot start shootin up some heads 
 I don't know nothin' but guns, I don't hold nothin' but guns 
 I just know I got a gun, all y'all better run 
 I'm on the edge, to go out like them niggas with dreads 
 Do what I said, I come to take the bumbaclot bread 
 Did you hear that, it's like death's in the air 
 When the wind starts holla'n and the moon light glare 
 Is you scared?, I can see the fear in your eyes 
 When we open up the door, and we caught you by surprise 
 I got oozis, and AK's of plenty 
 I got gadgets and grenades galore 
 Everynight I make sure that I'm ready 
 And prepare for war 
 I got ratchets, and Tec 9's, and Semi's 
 Automatics and shotguns galore 
 If you fuck with me make sure your ready 
 And prepare for war 
 Money, cars, cash and hoes 
 That's the way, a gangsta roll 
 I don't know what you've been told 
 Where you been before, but that's how it goes 
 They say that's all I talk about is murder murder kill kill 
 But if I die today another nigga still will 
 On the front line marchin, to the battle feild 
 With a black hoody on and a pair of old Timbs 
 Ghetto sargent, I think I see the target 
 I hit them niggas up, but I don't know where they car went 
 The neighborhood love me, I buy they kids Christmas 
 And give 'em all money, to keep 'em out my business, no witness 
 I got oozis, and AK's of plenty 
 I got gadgets and grenades galore 
 Everynight I make sure that I'm ready 
 And prepare for war 
 I got ratchets, and Tec 9's, and Semi's 
 Automatics and shotguns galore 
 If you fuck with me make sure your ready 
 And prepare for war 
 (Bridge-Young Buck 2x) 
 Get your camolauge suits, and your combat boots 
 We ain't going to iraq, we just pullin up and shootin 
 Your life is what I want dawg, you can keep the loot 
 This is how the G's do, salute (salute) 
 Put the potatoe on the end of the round 
 Make the sound quiet down 
 The block don't eat if a nigga not around 
 Like a sniper, I keep my chopper low to the ground 
 Milatary minded, and I'm South Side now 
 Got my canteen filled up with henessy nigga 
 A bullet broof vest, and my tank on spinners 
 Attention!, you about to enter a war zone 
 Why you come around here homie you know its on 
 I got oozis, and AK's of plenty 
 I got gadgets and grenades galore 
 Everynight I make sure that I'm ready 
 And prepare for war 
 I got ratchets, and Tec 9's, and Semi's 
 Automatics and shotguns galore 
 If you fuck with me make sure your ready 
 And prepare for war
