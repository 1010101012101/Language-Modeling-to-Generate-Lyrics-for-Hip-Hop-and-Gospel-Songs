LeBron James: 
 Yeah Buck man 
 These motherfuckers out here talkin' wreckless man 
 Ain't got records or shit 
 Real gangstas beat that fake ass up 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Fuck you rap niggas back that ass up 
 Your money slow motion get your cash up 
 These niggas is starvin' 
 They beggin' and borrowin' 
 Want to hate on the Unit nigga we too busy ballin' 
 We done did the callin' 
 So fuck all of y'all and... 
 Every motherfucker that is down with you 
 Come to your studio session let off a round or two 
 See I've been dyin' just to see what this four pound'll do 
 And them hatin' ass niggas better play y'all part 
 Better stay in your lane nigga don't come out the yard 
 I got something to make it hotter than four hundred degrees 
 So if you ain't hatin' on me 
 Then come and get one of these keys 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 I got my beat turned up I can't hear you haters 
 I can't hear you haters 
 I can't hear you haters 
 I got my stunner shades on I don't see you haters 
 I don't see you haters 
 I don't see you haters 
 You know a nigga money long I don't know you haters 
 I don't know you haters 
 I don't know you haters 
 I catch you cowards later on I'm a see you later 
 I'm a see you later 
 I'm a see you later 
 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 You know the difference from me and you is I don't wait on rap money 
 Take me to jail but bitch you can't take the trap from me 
 You push a six 
 Big deal I push bricks 
 Put a Benz in my baby mama's name she legit 
 Nigga quit 
 Shit I ain't got no time for this 
 Buy all the weed I can't figure out what kind to get 
 Somebody throw that nigga something get him back on his feet 
 I never left so I don't got to go back to the streets 
 I'm by myself like "Ok who want it with me?" 
 Take a deep breath OK, now lets go and see 
 That's what I thought 
 But I don't want to talk no more 
 I got a Phantom, I'm a show you what I bought this for 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 I got my beat turned up I can't hear you haters 
 I can't hear you haters 
 I can't hear you haters 
 I got my stunner shades on I don't see you haters 
 I don't see you haters 
 I don't see you haters 
 You know a nigga money long I don't know you haters 
 I don't know you haters 
 I don't know you haters 
 I catch you cowards later on I'm a see you later 
 I'm a see you later 
 I'm a see you later 
 LeBron James: 
 Real Gs in this motherfuckin' shit 
 Young Buck, Ca$hville nigga 
 Hold your head up man 
 Get your paperwork right man 
 Where the street boys at baby? 
 Where your back up at? 
 You better watch what you say man 
 Cause real Gs in the spot tonight man 
 Get up out of the booth man, get some money 
 If it ain't workin' for you change the game 
 Stop talkin' all that weak and ass shit 
 My nigga ain't got to do shit man the streets grab your ass 
 And ain't 'gon let you go 
 G Unit South 
 Ca$hville Records
