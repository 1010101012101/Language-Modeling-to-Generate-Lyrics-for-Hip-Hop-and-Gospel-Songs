No I'm not jay-z 50 or P.Diddy

 I'm A dirty south soldier I hope y'all here me cause... 
 (I'm so in love with new york city) 
 Never met Big L or Big Pun 
 We only got big dreams where a nigga come from 
 Even with the beef shit still look what I done

 I'm back still got my mac and my switchblade 
 No love to them niggas actin' bitch made 
 It's 08 all I'm thinkin' 'bout is gettin' paid 
 Big yachts mansions buyin real estate 
 When young bucks got gun premieres 
 So I'm invitin niggas to try some dumb shit 
 Now all these celebrity hoes wanna get me cause... 
 (I'm so in love with new york city) 
 The streets fuck with me I get in their blood 
 I give them reality rap an the shit for the club 
 You think Buck gon bankrupt kill yourself 
 The only thing we all have in common is death 
 The last one left like my nigga Bun-B 
 My son in the streets of the N.Y.C. 
 Even if I get caught and the fed's Come get me, yeah! 
 (I'm so in love with new york city) 
 Here we go again!

 Here we go again!

 Gotta take what's mine (mine) make up for lost time (time) 
 My kind is designed for the grime (grime) 
 We all wanna shine (shine) loyalty is hard to find 
 You got love for your dog nigga show him a sign 
 Can't hold him in the [? ] if you wanna see him ball 
 Niggas build you up just to watch you fall 
 Now all of these celebrity hoes wanna get me cause... 
 (I'm so in love with new york city) 
 King of my own castle I'm a master 
 Stop an I'll fly right past ya 
 You know what I'm after 
 Until I get captured 
 When I'm in the casket like Ol' Dirty Bastard 
 Use to be a dream 
 Now it's me on the big screen 
 But my homie never saw sixteen 
 So if I see Pac when the lord come get me I'mma tell him that... 
 (I'm so in love with new york city)
