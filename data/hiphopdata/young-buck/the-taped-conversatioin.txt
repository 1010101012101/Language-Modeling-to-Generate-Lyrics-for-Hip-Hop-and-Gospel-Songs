Taped Conversation 
 The streets want to know 
 Where Young buck gone to... 
 How... How Young Buck gonna respond 
 If you see me in the streets rolling 
 If you see me on the block holding 
 If you see me rolling by 
 Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me) 
 If you see me in the streets rolling 
 If you see me in the block holding 
 If you see me rolling by 
 Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me) 
 Bitch niggers do bitch thangs 
 Look at 50 what he does just to get famous 
 Record my phone call, when I spoke from the heart 
 That was a year ago, this was a joke from the start 
 You a hoe, and I know 
 The only people record conversations is Five-O, nigger die slow 
 See here ya go, while you got a chance 
 Let a real nigger put a band on your hand 
 Understand, I don't bite the hand that feed me 
 But I will if the hand say it don't need me 
 Look at y'all on TV, Banks looks uneasy 
 If he told you how he feel, this is where he'd be 
 And they know Yayo is stuck in you're a-hole 
 Half of your staff only there for your pay roll 
 Hey Tip, lay low, you ain't gotta respond 
 He had the Magic Stick, I got the Magic Wand 
 I'm the Don (here I come, here I come) 
 If you see me in the streets rolling

 If you see me rolling by 
 Remember that you don't know me 
 If you see me in the streets rolling

 Real niggers do real thangs 
 Real niggers never die, never give names 
 If a real nigger cry, then it's real pain 
 So on the real my nigga I don't feel ashamed 
 Ain't no pussy in my veins, I'm a G 
 Without me, y'all just a U-N-I-T 
 Without B, y'all should just give it out free 
 'Cause in the South WE consider you WEAK 
 Nigga, when I speak, the streets get reliefed 
 They really find the truth out about this beef 
 A victim of defeat when your album was released 
 When Jay-Z made Kanye look like a beast 
 When B.T told Jim Jones it was peace 
 Just trynna get some New York love at least 
 But they loving me 
 I'm laughing at you while you worried 'bout me 
 When your punk ass respond, I'ma give you verse THREE. 
 Haha you'll see 
 If you see me in the streets rolling 
 If you see me in the block holding 
 If you see me rolling by 
 Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me) 
 If you see me in the streets rolling

 Aw man, I guess you must have forgot 
 Every man got an emotional side to him! 
 Yeah, whether he choose to show it or whether he choose to hide it, hehe 
 Don't make you no less than a motherfucking man 
 Nigger I'ma G, 50! 
 So let me talk to your punk ass 
 Tell you what you wanna hear. 
 You know when you put that shit out you should have told them that 
 That was a conversation that me and you had! 
 Something like a year ago, right? 
 It was a heart felt conversation from Young Buck... 
 So yeah, they heard the emotional side of me 
 But they see the bitch-nigger in you 50 
 Believe that! 
 'Cause see like... Nigga looked at you as a big brother, my nigga 
 Seven years, I mean we done made millions together nigga, hehe! 
 I followed your lead I should say, you know 
 So I dealt with you from the heart nigga! 
 I mean I thought you dealt with me from the heart too 
 But now I know. 
 Yeah, I see 
 The devil in disguise... 
 We see now. The whole world see now! 
 And I know you thinking this shit making you look big 
 But you really look bad my nigga! 
 Look at what you had my nigga!
