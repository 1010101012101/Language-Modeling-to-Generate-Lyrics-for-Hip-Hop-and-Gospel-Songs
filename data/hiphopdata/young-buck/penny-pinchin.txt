 Man it's all about platinum from the records to the neclace boi, 
 Don't hand me the keys if it ain't show room floor, 
 Ten diamonds in the rolli betta add ten more, 
 From the bend up lift my hands up good lord, 
 Wats the use of a playa wit paper dat don't show it, 
 Screamin I got money but don't nobody no it, 
 I work for it, so dat mean I got da right to roll twenties, 
 And sag my jeans, da average gehtto childs dream, 
 Turnin' some cream and rollin' vitwizy wil lizzy, why still hes a team, 
 And seem I've accomplished dat, 
 Bought a charm, went in a vice I took it back, 
 When I return I want all my diamonds phat, 
 I can't get off track, 
 When my dawgs in my pack feel just like that, 
 Look park your cadillacs ain't no time for stallin, 
 While you penny pinchin playa I be out der ballin,
