(Intro-50 cent) 
 Yeah, I'm a special kinda nigga with mine's 
 I grind, I get's paper, you know what I mean? 
 Hahaha, oh yeah 
 (Chorus-50 cent) 
 I'm a bonafide hustler, nigga get outta line I'll cut ya' 
 Me, I'm 'bout my paper, it's fuck ya' 
 If you play games with mine, I'll come at you from behind 
 With my nine, I'm a bonafide hustler 
 (Verse one-50 cent) 
 They heaven's for the church go'ers, and hell's for the heathens 
 So I'm'a just ball the fuck out, while I'm breathin 
 8th after 8th, what you know about that fast flip? 
 Crack spots, smokey fiends, suckin on that glass dick 
 Man sham stay askin' for a dime for nine 
 I tell you what, I hook you up, this one last time 
 Custody's comin', son is pumpin, watch the packs disolve 
 Singles, c-notes, to food stamps, we stackin' it all 
 Past that joint, what's his name son? I don't remember 
 The haitian nigga with the guitar that sang gone in November 
 I do a buck 40 in the rain, hydro plainin' 
 Lamborghini diablo, candy-painted 
 Got that hydro burnin', got the burner in the stash 
 Hit the hazards, hit the a.c., then it come out the dash 
 If I go in the club son, and niggas start dumbin' 
 Start shootin n' I ain't straped, fuck it, I'm runnin' 
 (Chorus-50 cent) 
 I'm a bonafide hustler, nigga get outta line I'll cut ya' 
 Me, I'm 'bout my paper, it's fuck ya' 
 If you play games with mine, I'll come at you from behind 
 With my nine, I'm a bonafide hustler 
 Nigga get outta line I'll cut ya' 
 Me, I'm 'bout my paper, it's fuck ya' 
 If you play games with mine, I'll come at you from behind 
 With my nine, I'm a bonafide hustler 
 (Verse two-young buck) 
 I been out here for too long, I deserve to get a bird 
 The fiend's know my name now, from standin' on this curb 
 I got blood on my shirt, and a hand full of crack 
 A bunch of lil' niggas with dime sack's in they backpacks 
 Come and get it, we got it, take a trip to the projects 
 You see the police, but we gon' sell our dope regardless 
 Niggas know me, from fillin up ya' heroine needles 
 I'm connected with them people who don't speak no English 
 We ain't scared of the road, we just get it and go 
 When you see them tennessee tags nigga, you already know 
 I don't trust no hoes, that's how 't got pop'd 
 He showed the bitch where his stash was, she told it to the cops 
 Me and preist had the streets on lock 
 He'd break down the blocks, I'd open up shop, 'round the clock 
 And I ain't gon' stop, so soon as you come home from the pen 
 We at it again, we gettin' it for 10, my nigga 
 (Chorus-50 cent) 
 I'm a bonafide hustler, nigga get outta line I'll cut ya' 
 Me, I'm 'bout my paper, it's fuck ya' 
 If you play games with mine, I'll come at you from behind 
 With my nine, I'm a bonafide hustler 
 Nigga get outta line I'll cut ya' 
 Me, I'm 'bout my paper, it's fuck ya' 
 If you play games with mine, I'll come at you from behind 
 With my nine, I'm a bonafide hustler 
 (Verse three-tony yayo) 
 Now I'm headed down south and that's my word 
 I'm on a greyhound, 'bout to move these birds 
 And if these niggas don't let me sling 
 I'm out there robbin' everything 
 Got a brand new mack and a p-89 
 Yay's a hustler, man I stay on the grind 
 9 grams of heroine, 100 grams of coke 
 12 o's of mushrooms, 2 pounds of smoke 
 3 gal's of dust juice, and a tank of l.s.d. 
 And a 1000 pills of every kind of ecstacy 
 Hash, ha-sheesh, I bought a '62 
 When I was younger with my crew 
 I had them niggas sniffin glue 
 It's 40 cinnagrams, to them trucka's and bammer's 
 And I can chef up a miricle with arm and hammer 
 I'm a hustler, man I supply the fiends 
 I'm a hustler, nigga I'll sell you a dream 
 (Chorus-50 cent) 
 I'm a bonafide hustler, nigga get outta line I'll cut ya' 
 Me, I'm 'bout my paper, it's fuck ya' 
 If you play games with mine, I'll come at you from behind 
 With my nine, I'm a bonafide hustler 
 Nigga get outta line I'll cut ya' 
 Me, I'm 'bout my paper, it's fuck ya' 
 If you play games with mine, I'll come at you from behind 
 With my nine, I'm a bonafide hustler
