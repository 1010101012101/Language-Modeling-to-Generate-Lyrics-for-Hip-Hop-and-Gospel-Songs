Won't you throw a nigga somethin', 
 I'm fucked up just like you, 
 My lights off and my bills is due, 
 O you think, 'cause I'm a rap star I didn't pay for that car, 
 Or if you pop off I won't take it that far, 
 Shit, its only really niggas come outside, 
 Xzibit don't come around here and pimp no rides, 
 I'm still grimey nigga, Don't stand behind me nigga, 
 I'm all over this gauge you can find me nigga, 
 If the youth don't learn how to shoot these days, 
 We be dressed in a suit on a way to the grave, 
 See my man lil weasel, he come from my city, 
 13 when he went in, now the nigga 20, 
 Come on homie get in and load up the semi, 
 Tell my lawyer I ain't takin' what they give me, 
 You hear me? I tattoo G-unit in my veins so if I make it to the gates God know my gang, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) for the niggas I shot this year, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) for the dead, the one's that's not here, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) forgive me for I have sinned, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) 'cause I'm about to do it again 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) for the niggas I shot this year, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) for the dead, the one's that's not here, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) forgive me for I have sinned, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) 'cause I'm about to do it again 
 I done been to Rome, you know the home of the Pope, 
 But right around the corner a nigga sold me some dope, 
 I been thinkin' too late to holla just say no, 
 If you broke when the bus leave, you can't go, 
 If there's light at the end of the road then I'm comin', 
 I don't need no bitch my daughter is my woman, 
 Cause ain't no click like the one I got, 
 It ain't no clique out there this hot, 
 You get shot the fuck up, Pop the fuck up, This is not the work of a fat joe bussa, 
 I'm far from but close to the pen, 
 The judge say he never wanna see me again, 
 And Johnny Cochran dead, so what a nigga gon do? 
 Yeah that's what I thought, whatever he have to, 
 Bow your head, and listen to the words I said, 
 I'm still here and y'all thought I supposed to be dead 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) for the niggas I shot this year, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) for the dead, the one's that's not here, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) forgive me for I have sinned, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) 'cause I'm about to do it again 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) for the niggas I shot this year, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) for the dead, the one's that's not here, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) forgive me for I have sinned, 
 Let us pray (PRAY!) 'cause I'm about to do it again
