(Young buck) 
 I'm sick and tired of these same ol' broke bitches 
 No job all they wanna do is smoke swishes 
 Get some money hoe why you wanna watch mine 
 Ain't no tellin' what I'm gon' be drivin' next time 
 Seven figga nigga we don't buy the bar no mo 
 Pull up the paper work tell the owner he can go 
 Walk like a pimp bitch 
 Talk like a soldier 
 I got new york niggas candy paintin up they rovers 
 It say 200 but it go a little over 
 Not the corvette the ferrari testarossa 
 We can bet on any point on the dice 
 Pick 'em up 
 Shake 'em twice 
 Get 'em girl 
 Look I'm nice 
 I'm so clean with my g-unit kicks on 
 I might be goin' in when pimp c get home 
 If you don't like me say it to my face 
 Just because I caught a case don't mean you can't be erased 
 It must be the ice or the money that I make 
 They talk behind my back but they won't say it to my face 
 Hoe, say it to my face (yeah), say it to my face (yeah) 
 They talk behind my back but they won't say it to my face 
 It gotta be these cars or the trips that I take 
 That make 'em wanna hate, won't you say it in my face bitch 
 Hoe, say it to my face (yeah), say it to my face (yeah) 
 They talk behind my back but they won't say it to my face

 From north to the south east mid to the west 
 Walk up in the hardest hood ask a nigga 'bout me 
 They gon tell ya bun b is straight mothafuckin' g' 
 A gangsta from his toes to the top of his fitted 
 Trillest nigga in the flesh you can't fuck wit' it 
 Got the German hand guns they shoot 2 2 3 
 Bust through ya condo 'n' rip open ya knees 
 My nigga please you don't want it save your breath 
 By yourself imma ride till ain't no enemy is left 
 When the middle finger niggas hit your block like insurgents 
 There's no deterrents from us cleanin' your clock like detergent

 Why this pimp I bet they die before they reach their first 
 Mothafuckin' sale

 It must be the ice or the money that I make 
 They talk behind my back but they won't say it to my face 
 Hoe, say it to my face (yeah), say it to my face (yeah)

 Undercover groupie niggas want them stop and plead 
 For the last time I don't smoke regular weed 
 It don't matter where we at man 
 We firin it up 
 Security don't stop the weed man from findin' us 
 Industry dick suckas keep runnin' ya mouth 
 And imma give ya motherfuckas something to talk about 
 It must be the ice or the money that I make 
 They talk behind my back but they won't say it to my face 
 Hoe, say it to my face (yeah), say it to my face (yeah)
