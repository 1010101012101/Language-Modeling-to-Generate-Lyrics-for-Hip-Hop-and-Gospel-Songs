(Feat. 50 cent) 
 [Young buck:] yeah 
 [50 cent:] man I've been tellin' niggas over and over 
 [Young buck:] ayo waddup niggas 
 [50 cent:] do not play wit this nigga man 
 [Young buck:] ayo man there be a lotta niggas out here, talkin' bout they got beef with g-unit and you know I be seeing these niggas, I be by myself and shit, niggas be like a hundred deep and shit, I be like wassup nigga dem niggas be like nah man, it ain't like dat 
 (Verse 1: young buck) 
 Look up it's a full moon 
 The sound of the wind blowin' 
 And you don't know you bout to get killed 
 But I been knowin' 
 The nights still young 
 I might as well come round midnight 
 Just me all by my lonely 
 My homies gonna sit tight 
 I'm workin wit a pocket and just a lil bit of gas money 
 But bet I come back 
 Wit what dem niggas done snatch from me 
 My crip and blood thugs wanna get witcha 
 They mad at me 
 Cuzz I'm tellin' dem its personal nigga 
 I wanna see if this mothafucka want it wit me 
 So on three ima hop up out dis suv 
 If you around em 
 N u feel like you down wit em 
 Juss soon as this round hit em 
 Ya lay in da ground wit em 
 Awaitin by Satan 
 And being carried by the lord 
 What my life cost bill gates couldn't even afford 
 Ain't nuttin stoppin' reprocutions if I die 
 This ain't got nuttin to do wit dr. dre muthafucka 
 It's you and i 
 I don't need 10 niggas wit me 
 I don't run, echo, get da police 
 I will do it myself 
 You know me 
 Ima muthafuckin g 
 If its beef bitch nigga will see 
 I will it do it myself 
 Let 'em hate 
 Homie you know where I be 
 You done seen me get down on TV 
 I will do it myself 
 And I brought the whole unit wit me 
 But they already know how I be 
 (Verse 2: young buck) 
 In the beginning 
 I was humble just thankful for makin' it out the jungle 
 I never ever said nuttin on dis mic I didn't want to 
 Ima soldier 
 And soon as 50 gives me a mission 
 I'm on my enemies territory 
 To play mah position 
 Homie know me 
 And even if dat nigga is where ya chain 
 See we both from the 
 But homie we ain't da same 
 And I remain in the same fukin project building 
 I got guns everywhere 
 Bullet holes in da ceiling 
 My adrenaline pumping 
 Got this twelve gauge dumpin 
 Out da back of dis cutlass 
 So if I get hit up 
 Then fuck it 
 The reaper comin' so don't look back 
 Juss keep runnin' 
 Tell 50 for this hit 
 I don't need nuttin 
 You owe me one 
 And show dis homie where he be at 
 That's all I need to know 
 You can go 
 Ima be back 
 Any other time 
 I prolly woulda asked banks to ride 
 But this ain't got nuttin to do wit g-unit nigga 
 It's you and i
