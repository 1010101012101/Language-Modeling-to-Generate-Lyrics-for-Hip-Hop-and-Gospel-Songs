You, you, you with your funny, fun, fun 
 Lookin' up at the sunny, sun, sun 
 Butterfly cheeks and lemon-cut hair 
 Hardly a worry and never a care 
 In her eyes, the color of love 
 In your eyes, the color of love 
 Diamond in the back with the sunroof open 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Eyes real low, just singin' my song 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Life already fast so I'm movin' along 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Blowin' my smoke all by myself, just 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Lemme drop my top, turn up my pac 
 Now close ya eyes, picture me rollin' through ya block 
 Holla back baby, my Chevy clean but my Lac crazy 
 The back bumpa on the ground like I'm ridin' with a fat lady 
 Look what God gave me 
 A '72 Caprice Classic, race me, it go about a buck-80 
 Turnin' heads as I switch lanes 
 No ice, I let my XXXXX wear my big chain 
 Big things goin' down in a small hood 
 Jack boys wanna rob, I wish y'all would 
 See when the sunshine come out the Lamborghini somehow 
 Had them haters mad, lookin' at me with their tongue out 
 (Wow) 
 Diamond in the back with the sunroof open 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Eyes real low, just singin' my song 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Life already fast so I'm movin' along 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Blowin' my smoke all by myself, just 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Candy coated muscle car 'cause I'm a hustle star 
 This is how we love to ball, me and my roll dogs 
 Inside sweet like new cucci, the roof Gucci 
 The mats on my floor roll like sushi 
 Flyin' through traffic 
 Don't trip 
 Gotta hemi with a tip 
 I can give it to ya real quick 
 Lewis Sonnis got me feelin' like I'm floatin' 
 Or is the kush that I blow in trill motion 
 I hit the block with the doors open, the hoes open 
 I'm lookin' like a video in slow motion 
 And I'm feelin' like new money 
 You haters too funny 
 Mad 'cause the paint fresh, shoes ugly 
 Diamond in the back with the sunroof open 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Eyes real low, just singin' my song 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Life already fast so I'm movin' along 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Blowin' my smoke all by myself, just 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 I walk with a lean, I only bump the 80's themes 
 Hand XXXX stuck in the seat, I'm a ladies dream 
 Since days of the teens 
 Servin' the fiends was all that I've seen 
 The American dream but life ain't no crystal stack 
 And it ain't with it seem 
 The streets ain't playin' it fair 
 Listen up, ride with us, we can take you there 
 I ride Cadillacs on custom hoods, caps and vogues 
 I ride black on black, back to back, fresh from head to toe 
 Everywhere we go, more hoes and plenty of dro 
 Everywhere we go, more shows and plenty of dough 
 It's Young Noe, E.D.I., Young Buck and Capp 
 And we do this for respect, 
 And Hi-Tek, bless the track 
 We ridin' 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Diamond in the back with the sunroof open 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Eyes real low, just singin' my song 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Life already fast so I'm movin' along 
 Drivin' down the freeway 
 Blowin' my smoke all by myself, just 
 Drivin' down the freeway
