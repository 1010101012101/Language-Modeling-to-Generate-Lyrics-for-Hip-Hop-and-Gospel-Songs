Uh, oh, young buck 
 Dirty south, yo 
 I hear him talkin' but he 'bout to get that ass stomp 
 Watch how I get the club crunk, I'ma make 'em stomp 
 We ain't playin' wanna front, get that ass stomp 
 Do it like them dirty south boys do and stomp 
 Now, where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off 
 Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off 
 Now, where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off 
 Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off 
 I'm Cadillac n through the hood sittin' on 24's 
 T.V's playin' rim's spinnin', blowin' plenty 'dro 
 Don't have to mention when you pimpin' you get plenty hoes 
 It's all on you if you gon' trick or you gon' get yo' dough 
 I know I got these haters, mad I can love that 
 When you got love for the streets, they give ya love back 
 Look in my eyes, you can tell I ain't never scared 
 Poppin' them thangs, I'm rockin' my chain anywhere 
 If you gon' represent your hood, what you waitin' on? 
 Security better back up when they play this song 
 And we 'bout 50 strong, please don't make us do you wrong 
 My click of guerrilla's they got they G-Unit's on 
 All of that mean muggin' really don't mean nothin' 
 C'mon n' take it outside, let me see somethin' 
 W-w-what now? Don't get B-B-Buck'd down 
 Stop all this hatin' or this club gon' get s-s-shut down 
 Now, where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off 
 Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off 
 I hear him talkin' but he 'bout to get that ass stomp 
 Watch how I get the club crunk I'ma make 'em stomp 
 We ain't playin' wanna front, get that ass stomp 
 Do it like them dirty south boys, do and stomp 
 Now, where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off 
 Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off 
 Now, where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off 
 Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off 
 G-G-G-Unit, comin' straight outta Compton 
 Lace up my G-6's and I'm A-Town stompin' 
 Got ten-thousand cash in my pocket, let the pump in 
 'Cause Luda and Young Buck always gettin' me into somethin' 
 Low rider out front, I'm tryin' to get into somethin' 
 Step on banks, shoot one more time then I'ma start bustin' 
 Rows gold in my grill, I got a dirty mouth 
 And a bitch with a fat ass from the dirty, dirty south 
 I wasn't tryin' to get the cover of the Double XL 
 Just tryin' to fuck Mya 'cause Dre said, "Sex sells" 
 Don't be mad at the rocks in my fuckin' chain 
 Don't be mad 'cause your bitch chose Buck and Game 
 You see the logo tatted on my neck 
 The same one I'm autographin' on the chest 
 Put your bottles in the air for Yayo, he on House Arrest 
 And on behalf of 50 Cent, this is G-Unit West 
 Now stomp, G-G-G-Unit, now stomp, G-G-G-Unit 
 I hear him talkin' but he 'bout to get that ass stomp 
 Watch how I get the club crunk, I'ma make 'em stomp 
 We ain't playin' wanna front, get that ass stomp 
 Do it like them dirty south boys do and stomp 
 Now, where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off 
 Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off 
 Now, where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off 
 Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off 
 Mothafucka, I'm a monster in this game similar to the Lochness 
 My rhymes is nappy rooted, some verses gotta process 
 The truth in this booth, ain't no doubt when I'm rappin' 
 If I say it I've either done it or it's 'bout to happen 
 When I pull up in the Louis truck on 26's people dumb out 
 If life's a crap game, I'm rollin' 7's on the come out 
 These rapper's think I'm ignent, love sayin' my name 
 'Cause maintainin' my fish tank an' they house cost the same 
 Ask me I'll say I made it an' it sure wasn't luck 
 'Cause hustler's relate to me and some are younger than Buck 
 You see I'm married to my music but we got a prenupt 
 So, if that bitch don't act right, I'm still gettin' my cut 
 My deals never get screwed my contracts practice abstinence 
 I'm masterin' this program hazin' these undergraduates 
 So, pimpin' be easy, quit catchin' feelings 
 'Cause you worth a couple hundred grand and I'm worth millions 
 Nobodys thinkin' about you plus your beef ain't legit 
 So, please stay off the T I P of my dick 
 I hear him talkin' but he 'bout to get that ass stomp 
 Watch how I get the club crunk, I'ma make 'em stomp 
 We ain't playin' wanna front, get that ass stomp 
 Do it like them dirty south boys do and stomp 
 Now, where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off 
 Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off 
 Now, where you from? Who the boss? I'ma break him off 
 Where you from? Who the boss? Lemme break him off
