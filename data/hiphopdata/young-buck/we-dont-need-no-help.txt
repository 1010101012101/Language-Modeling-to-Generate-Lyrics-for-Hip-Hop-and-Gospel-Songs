(Yeah) 
 (Ha ha) 
 (Fuck tha police) 
 Think about it 
 Everytime you bitches come around 
 Either we runnin' 
 Or we layin' on the fuckin' ground 
 Just look at Chris 
 A nigga popped and shot him in the club 
 They called the ambulance 
 And y'all didn't even show up 
 Or let me tell you bout Lil Ricky 
 When he took his bullets 
 You want the trigger man 
 Y'all was the ones that pulled it 
 That's why we represent them niggaz 
 Like Larry Davis 
 Before he let you cowards kill him 
 He just aimed and sprayed it 
 Now what you wan' do 
 Bitch I got a gun too 
 We gon' keep on sendin' shots 
 Everytime y'all come through 
 Got the nerve to tell a nigga put his hands up 
 Then beat him to the ground 
 When you put the boy in handcuffs 
 Fuck 
 Fuck the police 
 We'll handle it ourselves 
 Even if I'm beat to death 
 Nigga we don't need no motherfuckin help 
 Now to the right, to the left 
 Let 'em know 
 We don't need no mothrf**kin' help 
 (x2) 
 Fuck tha police 
 Fuck the law 
 Fuck tha police 
 Fuck 'em all 
 We don't need no motherfuckin' help 
 We used to play cops and robbers as a little kid 
 Whoever was the pigs 
 We would go and split his wig 
 Then as the years past 
 Niggaz only got worse 
 Jumped into the gang shit 
 Gotta protect our turf 
 We had enough of gettin' handcuffed 
 And pulled over 
 We started tryin' 
 Knock they heads off they fuckin' shoulders 
 Now where my soldier's at 
 Get ready for combat 
 I'm livin' like them niggaz 
 That dun' went to vietnam yeah 
 So if you try to lock me up 
 For smokin' my weed 
 The whole force of police 
 Is what they gon' need 
 One of a kind 
 I'm the last of a dyin' breed 
 Even the one that was before me 
 He was sayin' 
 Fuck the police 
 We'll handle it ourselves 
 Even if I'm beat to death 
 Nigga we don't need no motherfuckin help 
 Now to the right, to the left 
 Let 'em know 
 We don't need no mothrf**kin' help 
 (x2) 
 Fuck tha police 
 Fuck the law 
 Fuck tha police 
 Fuck 'em all 
 We don't need no motherfuckin' help 
 (Talking) 
 When I'm in New York I'm Hollerin' 
 We don't need no motherfuckin' help

 When I'm in Tennesee I'm Hollerin' 
 We don't need no motherfuckin' help
