 Hey there he go, he don't know that we behind him 
 So go pull up beside him, and lemme put this 9 in him 
 You ever seen the 30-30 with the scope on it? 
 A bunch of niggas smokin' weed, that got dope on it 
 And we don't leave no evidence, or no finger prints 
 Follow certain elements, 'cause niggas goto jail for this 
 They say I'm heaven sent, I think I'm hell bound 
 'Cause I'm addicted to the way a 12 gauge sound 
 (Verse four-d-tay) 
 I keep the dough in, swing the chopper and the pit-bull shit 
 If he run, he ain't gettin' one, get a clip full of it 
 That's for movin, must have been some confusion, when I came in 
 Told you lay the fuck down, or else these bullets cave in 
 Must thought I was playin', I'm'a let you know when I shoot that 4 
 How it go when a gangster roll, murder man, blood bath, what'd you take it for 
 I ain't playin' games, ain't nothing gon' ever change 
 Murder put money on your head, gimme his brain, muthafucka!
