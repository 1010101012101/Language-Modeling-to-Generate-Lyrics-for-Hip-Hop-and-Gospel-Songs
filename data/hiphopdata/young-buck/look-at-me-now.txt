 You know, growin' up in the hood, 
 Goin' through all kinds of thangs, ya heard? 
 Some of its good, some of its bad, 
 But the things you go through in life, 
 Make you who you are 
 Look at me now! 
 (Mr. porter) 
 From the day I was born, I've been hustle'n strong 
 I been strugglin' since a child, now them day's is gone 
 And niggas said I wouldn't do it, but I'm proving 'em wrong 
 Now they got they hands out like I owe them some 
 I ain't got time for the bickering, and carrying on 
 It ain't too much into who I don't know 
 How many times do I have to sit in and grown 
 I'm with young buckits feelin' enough to know when you niggas is hoes 
 (Young buck) 
 I still remember them nights under the street lights 
 Fiends don't give a damn, they want who got the cheap price 
 I'm trying to get right, get it and go 
 You see people is dyin' fast, and the money is slow 
 We used to hang in front of the store 
 Flag down cars to be a movie star, go get a glass jar 
 Once you cook it and cut it homie, go stand out in public 
 See the work sell's itself, if ya got enough of it 
 Plenty thugs get shot, but see it's all in the game 
 Even I took a couple of 'em, but still I remain 
 I ain't dippin from that same lead project figga' 
 I done went with no lights, and no water nigga 
 And I'm still hood, that mean I still cook 
 Get on the block and go get mine, like you should 
 How can I be good? when rappers wanna be shuge' 
 Suroundin' myself with family, so I can sleep good

 I would light me a cancer stick, thinkin' how can I get 
 My momma out the bricks, and my whole click legit 
 Lil jimmy in the fed's, its just me and some ted's 
 We cuttin' heads doin' whatever to buy a lump of bread 
 The hot beat faces, I really loved it 
 To blow 50 g's, and don't think nothing of it 
 We show love, but won't get no loved show'd back 
 Whoa kimosabi, what part of the game is that? 
 This a fact, and my war wounds on me can prove it 
 But look how you made me, go and show ya I can do it 
 I sollomly swear to hold it down for my homeboy 
 Locked up and don't know if they eva coming home boy 
 Time's keep tickin', another baby is born 
 That's gon' go through the same stuff I went through, and more 
 You wonder why I hustle, my life's on the line 
 My baby gotta have milk when she cryin', come on da now

 Now everybody got they hand out 
 Crackhead willin' spit these millions till they ran'd out 
 Shorty don't wanna holla now, 'cause her man out 
 But just last week I couldn't get it out her damn mouth 
 No where to go, look like I'm stuck in these bricks 
 Seems like the good die young, the bad get rich quick 
 Enough of this lemme take you to a whole 'nother level 
 It's like stopin the police from rollin' through the ghetto 
 Ain't nothing gettin' better, but the bills gotta get paid 
 That money come up short then them tecks gotta get spray'd 
 Errybody gotta grave, we just waitin to go to it 
 No matter what we do, we still gon' go through it 
 Some say that I'm heartless, and don't give a damn 
 They wont ever understand until they get a gram 
 This who I am, not who I wanna be 
 Open up your eyes and see, what these streets did done to me
