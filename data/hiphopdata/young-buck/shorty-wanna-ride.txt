 Oh you ain't never been to the dirty, dirty before? 
 Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me

 Blow dro, wanna ride with me, ride with me 
 Let ya hair down, you said you wanna thug 
 Don't be scared now

 (Verse one) 
 My 24's spinnin', the sticker's still on 'em 
 The same ol' hoes, but a nigga still want 'em 
 I'm parkin lot pimpin' on another nigga woman 
 She pullin up her skirt, tryin' show a nigga sumthin 
 Ya' car cloudy, my niggas all rowdy 
 This heinesy got a nigga drowsy, I'm outty 
 Now where them hoes at, look I'm tryin' to take you home 
 So what'cha got ya girlfriends, bitch bring 'em on 
 Hoe I'm tryin' to break a bone, when I get in them draw's 
 To the window, to the muthafuckin walls 
 What a nigga don't know wont hurt him' 
 So if ya' got a old man, bitch I ain't worried 
 And I got plenty room if ya think you wanna roll 
 See this is what they make caddillac trucks for 
 Let's go to a place you ain't never been, down in the country 
 I bet ya, I have ya sayin' ya love me 
 (Chrous) 
 Shorty wanna ride with me, ride with me

 (Verse two) 
 My shorty givin' brain, the liquor got right 
 It's aight, 'cause, you can be my wife, but only for tonight 
 Get ya ass on this bike, I can show you I'm'a ryder 
 The 600 coupe, with the old school wires 
 Geovanni rims, with perely's on the tires 
 They said 22's wouldn't fit, but they liars 
 We can take a trip to the hood and back 
 Then go and get a room, how hood is that? 
 What'cha waitin' on shorty? this the chance of your life 
 What I mean what I see in them jeans, I like 
 You don't know what your missin', just quit talkin' and listen 
 See I'm just holdin' up traffic, we just right here sittin' 
 Think about it 'for I bounce, and you holla, I'm wrong 
 And ya' see your best friend, in this impala, on chrome 
 If your ballin in your money long, you can relate 
 But all them broke ass niggas gon' hate
