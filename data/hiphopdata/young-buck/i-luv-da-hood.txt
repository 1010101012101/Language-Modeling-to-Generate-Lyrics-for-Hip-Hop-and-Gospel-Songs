(Young Buck) 
 G-Unit nigga 
 Yeah bitch you niggas know what it is with me nigga 
 Dirty south in this muthafucker 
 Young Buck nigga you know where I'm from Ca$hville nigga 
 (Get money) Make sure you put a dollar sign on the S too bitch 
 (Damn...) 
 (Young Buck) 
 Bulletwounds and tattoos is how I show my pain 
 I'm gone so much my little girl don't know my name 
 My palms covered in residue from cocaine 
 Been on the block since 6 in the morning 
 The neighbors complain about the traffic at my house (Fuck Y'all) 
 When they need to borrow something they put their hands out 
 Little kids start running when they see my car coming 
 Just looking at me will make a nigga start hustlin 
 I ain't a start nothing I just know how to count 
 Know how to eyeball an 8ball you wearin 'em out 
 Lips black from the blunt of that sour diesel and the desert eagle (I'm so illegal) 
 I can't even feed you what they put in the needles 
 Amsterdam got me thinking marijuana is legal 
 You can call me country but don't call me broke (Why) 
 We got all this money 50 where ya wanna go c'mon nigga 
 (Young Buck) 
 Shit ain't really all good but I luv da hood 
 All I need is my weed I luv da hood 
 We ain't living like we should but I luv da hood 
 But they still Tennekee yeah I luv da hood 
 Shit ain't really all good but I luv da hood 
 All I need is my weed I luv da hood 
 We ain't living like we should but I luv da hood 
 But they still Tennekee come and get it 
 (Game) 
 They say can remember Whoo Kid let it ride 
 Fuckin' wit G-Unit I let the Desert fly (gunshot) 
 Ridin' through Ca$hville wit Buck throwin' my dubs up 
 For those who don't know that stand for west side 
 I blast on my enemies 
 Fuck you if you ain't kinnin me 
 Knock your top off like Kennedy 
 Then sip hennesy 
 Ridin' through Tennessee 
 If you need coke Young Buck got the remedies 
 I got it for 9 5 if you wanna fly 
 Put 'em in a Range Rover if you wanna drive 
 If you only need 1 you ain't gotta come 
 I just pack it up and strap it to a bitch' thigh 
 You ever seen a Impala drive 
 Seen hollows fly 
 Seen yellow tape every time 
 It's a homoside 
 When it's drama I pull the glock from my waist 
 Niggas tried to make my mama cry 
 It's G-Unit nigga 
 You better recognize 
 I'll put you in the grave for that shit that Joe Budden Tried 
 I remember right there when my brother died 
 Then 2pac, Biggie Smalls and some other guys 
 So me and my homies ride 
 With a chrome .45 in my lap and my waist an the double 9's 
 Niggas tried to kill me but it wasn't time 
 I took 5 shots from my own brother' 9 
 Went into a coma woke up in the hospital 
 Cops said they found drugs 
 I said it wasn't mine 
 Bad boy but I wouldn't shine 
 Matter fact wouldn't shit 
 Thought that 'cause I wouldn't sign 
 Now its G Unit Nigga read between the lines Bitch
