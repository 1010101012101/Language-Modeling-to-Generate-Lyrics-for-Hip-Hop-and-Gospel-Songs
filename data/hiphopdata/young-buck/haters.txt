Eh Uh Uh Uh 
 Don't Ask me where the fuck I'm from Or what set I claim 
 I get money, I got a little bit of both games in me 
 Niggas hate so the marshburg hang with me 
 Feds wanna tap up my fone because they can't get me 
 I might as well give it to ya since Dre sent me 
 Just sit back and kick ya feet up ok 50 
 I'm on 1 and I just begun 
 I dare one of these blood cloats come test me gun 
 The rude boy of the south let me in this bitch 
 I just wish Tupac was here to witness this 
 Give me room to breathe and Imma blow you away 
 I move a 100 bricks a week and do a show every day 
 Hey, somebody gotta do it y'all 
 See I done been locked up and I don't know who the call 
 It's my time, so everybody jump on the train 
 With the AK aimed I can shootdown a plane Mutherfucker 
 Chorus 1x: (Kokane) 
 Haters, what makes you wanna do wrong? 
 (Makes you wanna do Wrong?) 
 Just to wake up early, After Hustlin all night long 
 (Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah) 
 My gun damn near bigger then me 
 I ain't the nigga to be 
 Cause every time a body drop, niggas mentioning me 
 I see a judge in my dreams when he sentencing me 
 My homeboy come in the courtroom and hit him with 3 
 I got the mind of a nigga bout to get him a key 
 All the feins lined up, they just waitin on me 
 Better hurry, hurry Its about to go down 
 And don't ya worry I brought a 100 rounds 
 We gon count to ten and then put the clips in 
 Whoever is the last man standin wins 
 You throw some money in the hood and it always works 
 My niggas crazy, They'll dig a dead body from the dirt 
 Better watch my mouth, 'cause I been watchin ya house 
 I'm in the bushes like when this nigga gonna come out? 
 Its enough of this he say she say shit 
 Now its time to find out who you with 
 Chorus 1x: (Kokane) 
 Haters, what makes you wanna do wrong? 
 (Makes you wanna do Wrong?) 
 Just to wake up early, After Hustlin all night long 
 (Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah) 
 Kokane: 
 The streets ain't got no love 
 Oh but I'm a nigga on top of things 
 These niggas don't feel my pain 
 Oh these niggas don't got a clue what I been through man 
 But I ain't even lookin' for love 
 Oh but I ain't lookin' for all ya sympthay 
 I gots to just do my thing 
 Chorus 1x: (Kokane) 
 Haters, what makes you wanna do wrong? 
 (Makes you wanna do Wrong?) 
 Just to wake up early, After Hustlin all night long 
 (Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)
