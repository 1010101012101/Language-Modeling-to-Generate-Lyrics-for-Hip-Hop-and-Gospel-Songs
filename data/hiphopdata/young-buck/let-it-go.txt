(Feat. Hi C & Sosa) 
 Young Buck: 
 Hey my nigga, down here in the dirty dirty 
 We ain't with that fake rap beef shit 
 You want to get into it lets go 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Talk about me baby get the good and the bad 
 I ain't the only motherfucker in the hood without a dad 
 Its 'gon take more than the game to get me mad 
 More to get me high than what you got in that bag 
 Nigga I'm focused 
 Ash tray full of roaches 
 See I'm the player who be cussin' out his coaches 
 Lamborghini with the lemonade suede seats 
 50 Cent helped but the streets made me 
 Got some niggas that I see with a trick up they sleeve 
 Might want to take heed 
 If your ass want to breathe 
 Fuck how it started nigga this is where it ends 
 And since we could never be friends 
 (Chorus: Vocal Sample) 
 It's like you better let it go 
 Think about what you doin' 
 Think about how you movin' 
 Think about the life you ruinin' 
 Think you better let it go 
 Think about the road you takin' 
 I mean what are you really chasin' (What you doin'?) 
 Think about the mistake you makin' 
 Think you better let it go 
 (Verse 2: Hi-C, Sosa) 
 [Hi-C:] I'm in a hooptie with a gangsta, bitch where the chauffeur? 
 .40 Cal in my holster 
 Me and Sosa 
 [Sosa:] What's up?, I'm caked up 
 Dripped out and draped up 
 G Unit sneakers at your motherfuckin' face bro 
 [Hi-C:] I formed up in the streets, yeah street game 
 Just one nigga that's too hard hustlin' it gently 
 [Sosa:] God meant me 
 To push a Bentley 
 Me and Hi-C sellin' niggas keys 
 By the threes 
 [Hi-C:] I'm a G 
 [Sosa:] A G 
 [Hi-C:] Made a G 
 [Sosa:] A G 
 [Hi-C:] Twenty five for a G 
 [Sosa:] A G 
 [Hi-C:] In them fuckin' streets 
 [Sosa:] And as I hustle in the valley of death 
 I give a fuck less I got a strap and a vest 
 Yes 
 [Hi-C:] The weed purple, coke white and the Ruger gray 
 Bullets goin' through your face 
 Another murder face 
 [Sosa:] So while the haters get kidnapped and robbed 
 We on stage gettin' paid just to rap some bars 
 G Unit South 
 (Chorus: Vocal Sample) 
 It's like you better let it go 
 Think about what you doin' 
 Think about how you movin' 
 Think about the life you ruinin' 
 Think you better let it go 
 Think about the road you takin' 
 I mean what are you really chasin' (What you doin'?) 
 Think about the mistake you makin' 
 Think you better let it go
