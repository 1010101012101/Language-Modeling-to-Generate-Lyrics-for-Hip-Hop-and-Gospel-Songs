(Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 I've been waitin' for retaliation for a long time 
 I made it out the hole by havin' a strong mind 
 You can lock my body but can't chain my brain 
 Bullet wounds and tattoos'll show you my pain 
 Maybe I am insane 
 I kind of feel that way 
 A nigga rich thinkin' about who I'm goin' to kill today 
 I went from the projects 
 All the way to private jets 
 I'm just gettin' my feet wet 
 I ain't even eat yet 
 I separated myself from all of the hate 
 Told Jimmy Iovine "This is all I'm a take" 
 I'm playin' Chess not Checkers and I ain't made a move yet 
 When these rappers disrespect they playin' Russian Roulette 
 Now who you with?, 'cause it's a matter of time 
 You got to watch your step you might cross that line 
 Its goin' down, I swear I got something for all of y'all 
 So don't be around my nigga when the night fall 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Real riders only ride for the right cause 
 So lets ride cause its on when the night falls 
 I'm a soldier 
 I'm a soldier 
 I'm a soldier 
 I'm a soldier 
 Real riders only ride for the right cause 
 So lets ride cause its on when the night falls 
 I'm a soldier 
 I'm a soldier 
 I'm a soldier 
 I'm a soldier 
 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 I know you want to kill me but I'm god's best friend 
 So when you get to the gates I tell him don't let you in 
 I'm Young Buck, King David 
 I'm on that slave shit 
 The white man own it, but the black man made this 
 Fuck around homie get your head knocked off 
 Tryin' to prove to your baby mama that your not soft 
 I ain't seen it all but I done seen enough 
 See when you live in the ghetto you dream too much 
 And when you make it out the ghetto you stay in touch 
 Never forget where you come from that's rule number one 
 But can't live life twice all you got is one chance 
 I can't live for you shit I'm only one man 
 Bloody murder, somebody 'gon die tonight 
 I'm gettin' high as a kite 
 Fuck if I'm wrong or right 
 I hear 'em callin' tellin' me don't let these niggas do it 
 Trigger fingers in the air let me hear G Unit 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 Real riders only ride for the right cause 
 So lets ride cause its on when the night falls 
 I'm a soldier 
 I'm a soldier 
 I'm a soldier 
 I'm a soldier 
 Real riders only ride for the right cause 
 So lets ride cause its on when the night falls 
 I'm a soldier 
 I'm a soldier 
 I'm a soldier 
 I'm a soldier
