(Feat. DJ Paul) 
 [Young Buck:] Aiyo Paul what up nigga? 
 [DJ Paul:] Buck what's goin' on baby? 
 Young Buck: 
 Aiyo nigga you know, you've been knowin' a nigga since he was knee-high 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 And it's like I'm down here in Ca$hville, 
 I got this motherfucker off the chain you know what I'm sayin'? 
 We trappin', I'm about to run this motherfucker hot 
 I'm comin' up to there in time to fuck with you homie 
 You know what I mean? 
 DJ Paul: 
 Right back at you nigga 
 From Ca$hville to M-Town 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 They'll never take me alive I ain't goin' back to jail 
 The money lookin' good I got dope to sell 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 You can't catch me and you can't hold me 
 And you can't find me because you don't know me 
 (Lets Go!) 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 First I'm a get a key 
 Here I go remember me? 
 I took it from my enemy 
 Left him in his Bentley seat 
 Never should have let me go, I done got my mind right 
 And even though I'm on parole somebody 'gon die tonight 
 Fuck it we 'gon park this 
 See who sittin' on twenty-sixes and we 'gon rob them 
 Holla at a couple bitches, know who we are man? 
 Some real niggas I'm a ghetto superstar man 
 Now set it off 
 Break 'em off 
 Fuck some handcuffs 
 Stand up 
 And what? 
 Nigga man up 
 Walked out the courtroom feelin' like OJ 
 I got my knife in the club if you want to play 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 They'll never take me alive I ain't goin' back to jail 
 The money lookin' good I got dope to sell 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 You can't catch me and you can't hold me 
 And you can't find me because you don't know me 
 (Lets Go!) 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 (Would you step out the car sir?) 
 Why'd you pull me over? 
 Looked him in his eye and took his head off his shoulders 
 Cocaine dreams 
 I can see me runnin' the team 
 Some butt naked bitches baggin' grams of that green 
 Bustin' at patrol cars from the project rooftops 
 Got to keep 'em out of here so that we can move the rock 
 Mafia, militant like a Black Panther 
 I'm like a young Huey Newton in a black Phantom 
 Yeah we shootin' 
 And recruitin' 
 Starting riots, that's how we do it 
 And I'm not turnin' myself in so stop askin' 
 We hop out blastin' 
 And walk out laughin' 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 They'll never take me alive I ain't goin' back to jail 
 The money lookin' good I got dope to sell 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 You can't catch me and you can't hold me 
 And you can't find me because you don't know me 
 (Lets Go!) 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 Young Buck: 
 What's up all my real niggas and real bitches? 
 It feels good to be in y'all city tonight 
 Now I need everybody, to put they trigger fingers in the air 
 And repeat after me: 
 (Lets Go!) 
 You got a gun bitch I got a gun to 
 You got a gun bitch I got a gun to 
 You got a gun bitch I got a gun to 
 You got a gun bitch I got a gun to 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 They'll never take me alive I ain't goin' back to jail 
 The money lookin' good I got dope to sell 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 You can't catch me and you can't hold me 
 And you can't find me because you don't know me 
 (Lets Go!) 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 Fuck the police, nigga fuck the police 
 Young Buck:

 And and you you can try to pull a nigga over and all that 
 But I tell my nigga, nigga we shoot back
