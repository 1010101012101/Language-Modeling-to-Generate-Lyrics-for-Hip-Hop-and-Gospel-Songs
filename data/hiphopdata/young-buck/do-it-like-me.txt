(Young buck) 
 All my thugs and thugettes 
 Walk where I walk, see what I see 
 Now I welcome you all to cashville, tennekee, bitch 
 All my life, I hustle'd all night 
 Now I'm all right, my wrist is all ice 
 And I did it all, without y'all advice 
 I done been to hell and back, twice 
 You can't do it like me! 
 Now as the world turns, I let my blunt burn 
 Police writin' down my tags, like I'm con'cerned (fuck em) 
 I graduated from the nickels and dimes 
 You need the f.e.d.'s bitch, to come get mine 
 Get on the grind hoe, and stay the fuck up outta mine fo' 
 The kid's find daddy lay'd out with his eyes closed 
 I know, can't be humble in the jungle 
 Give a nigga an inch, he'll take a whole mile from ya' 
 So I bust first, fuck this earth nigga 
 What's worse? wakin' up in the pen, or sleepin' up under the dirt 
 Boo yow! is the sound of the 40 cal. 
 Ak's bananna clips hold a 100 rounds 
 Test me, rude boy don't want none 
 Got jamacan's and hasian's buck, buck, buckin' they gun 
 Where the hood at? nigga, that's where I come from 
 Where shoot dice, snort white, sell crack and heroine

 You can walk like I do, and talk like me too 
 But nobody gon' rock with you 
 'Cause you can't do it like me (nah, you can't do it like me)

 Hold on a second homie, let's get this clear

 G-unit! 
 Somebody tell me what this world comin' to 
 Why they go get they metal detector's when we come through 
 Y'all, I know we got beef, and niggas say they wanna kill us 
 But you can't get mad, 'cause the whole world feel us 
 Do the math, half of these niggas lying in they rhymes 
 They don't even read the paper work, just sign on the line 
 I got a 9, and a heart to go get mine 
 And I'll be god damn, if I take a loss this time 
 I'm fishline, in the water, nibble only to get caught 
 May I take ya' order? yah, I can get it in new york 
 See the streets know, this nigga here'll let the heat go 
 Be low, don't be no muthafuckin' hero 
 A kilo'll get a nigga whole click killed 
 You ain't gotta spend shit, niggas'll hustle up a mill 
 When you live with all the roaches, you kill all the rats 
 And the thugs, that ain't focused, get they head cracked

 I know I got a dirty mouth, bitch I'm from the south 
 I'm nothin' like what you done seen or you done heard about 
 I'm in my best on the block, a vest and a glock, and the rest in my sock 
 Unless I was pac, you won't see me with a cross on my back 
 Gotta do my own thang, I can't copy that cat 
 Let me holla at ya' for a minute man 
 If ya stand for nothin' nigga, you'll fall for anythang 
 I'm bustin' any brain, they say that I'm insaine 
 But I came in this game with cocaine in my viens 
 What I'm sayin', that I'm trained to go and turn a penny to a 20 
 You complain, I'd rather work with what he sent me, ain't it strange? 
 How I went from a hoopty to a bently, I ain't changed 
 I'm in the hood, you want me? come and get me 
 Feel my pain, but don't feel sorry for me 
 'Cause they're some kids in samalia with nothin' to eat
