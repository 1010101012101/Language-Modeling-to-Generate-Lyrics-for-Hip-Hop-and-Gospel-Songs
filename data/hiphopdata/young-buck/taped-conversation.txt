Taped Conversation 
 The streets wanna know what Young Buck goin' do 
 How Young Buck goin' to respond (laughs) 
 If you see me in the streets rollin' 
 If you see me on the block corner 
 If you see me rollin' by 
 Remember you don't know me (you don't know me) X2 
 (Young Buck) 
 Bitch niggas do bitch things 
 Look at 50 what he does just to get fame 
 Record my phone call when I spoke from the heart 
 That was a year ago this was a joke from the start 
 You a hoe I know the only people record conversation is 5-0 now die slow 
 See how it go when you got a chance 
 Let a real nigga put a band on your hand 
 Understand I don't bite the hand that feed me but 
 I will if that hand says it don't need me 
 Look at y'all on TV Banks looks uneasy 
 If he told you how he feel this is where he be 
 And they know Yayo is stuck in you're a-hole 
 Half of your staff only there for your payroll 
 Hey Tip lay low you ain't have to respond 
 He had the magic stick I have the magic wand I'm the Don (Here I come) 
 If you see me in the streets rollin' 
 If you see me on the block corner 
 If you see me rollin' by 
 Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me) X2 
 (Young Buck) 
 Real niggas do real thangs 
 Real niggas never die and never give names 
 If a real nigga cry then it's real pain 
 So on the real my nigga I don't feel ashamed 
 Ain't know pussy in my veins I'm real G 
 Without me you just the U-N-I-T 
 Without beat you should just give it out free 
 'Cause in the south we consider you weak 
 Nigga we I speak the streets get releif 
 They really find the truth out about this beef 
 A victom of defeat when your album was released 
 When Jay-Z made Kanye look like a beast 
 BET told Jim Jones it was beef 
 Just tryin' to get some New York love at least 
 But they lovin' me I'm laughin' at you when your worryin' about me 
 When your punk-ass was fryin' I'm give your verse free (you'll know) 
 If you see me in the streets rollin' 
 If you see me on the block corner 
 If you see me rollin' by 
 Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me) X2 
 (Young Buck speaking the real) 
 If you see me in the streets rollin' 
 If you see me on the block corner 
 If you see me rollin' by 
 Remember that you don't know me (you don't know me) X3
