Young Buck: 
 Yeah Kay Slay, Drama, Whoo Kid 
 Y'all keep it real with me 
 Yeah 
 (I'm not 'gon play with y'all) 
 Good lookin' niggas all the DJs 
 I got love for y'all niggas man 
 (I'm not 'gon play with y'all) 
 (Verse 1: Young Buck) 
 Now let me take off my vest 
 Put some shit to rest 
 Khaled, play my shit nigga, I'm the best 
 I don't carry grudges 'cause, I get it off my chest 
 I'm a business man and Rick Ross will tell you this 
 Listen, I'm in a CEO position 
 So if I was still bullshittin' 
 You probably would have been a victim 
 I tried to reach out to show you what I'm about 
 Make records without me, nigga I am the south 
 Scarface will tell ya he done ate at my house 
 In the middle of Miami, Trick Daddy can vouch 
 Young Jeezy and T.I. be in the streets with Buck 
 Me and Akon sip Don and Wayne know what's up 
 Maybe Fat Joe tellin' you don't fuck with The Unit 
 Terror Squad is your clique you got to stay loyal to it 
 I'm all in M-I-A- saupassay 
 You can't ban me from the radio or no DJ 
 Matter fact all the hate 
 Make me carry all the weight 
 While you're takin' over the city I'm takin' over the state 
 G Unit ain't goin' nowhere 
 We here 
 50 made more money than the label this year 
 The beef is no fun when your enemy is broke 
 Sometime the captain of the ship sinks his own damn boat 
 But you playin' with fire 
 We will not expire 
 This is ghetto gospel nigga join the choir 
 See I could make it hard for the fans to buy it 
 I holla back at ya cause for now I'm tired 
 Young Buck: 
 Aiyo Banks hand me one of them cigars right there man 
 You ain't got to say nothing right now, chill out I got this 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 The things that people do, to try to keep us away 
 But every dog got his day 
 I'm not 'gon play with y'all 
 Hey what more can I say? 
 But every dog got his day 
 So lets load up an AK 
 I'm not 'gon play with y'all 
 Young Buck: 
 Buck the world 
 You know what it is 
 My shit bumpin' all over Florida 
 I mean I'm... I tried to get your man to play my shit 
 M-I-A- want to hear my shit 
 I mean they fuckin' with you... 
 But they fuckin' with me more nigga 
 Yeah 
 (The things that people do) 
 See what it is? 
 It's like... 
 I understand your situation man 
 (I'm not 'gon play with y'all) 
 You know? 
 Being loyal to your crew 
 Shit I'm loyal like a motherfucker to 
 But a hit is a hit nigga 
 (I'm not 'gon play with y'all) 
 And in the position you're in my nigga, you got to play the hits 
 And I'm buckin' nigga 
 So play my shit, like every other DJ 
 Yeah 
 Holla nigga 
 (So lets load up an AK) 
 Shout out to street niggas, DJs, all the ladies out there 
 (Hey) 
 I ain't 'gon forget y'all 
 Yeah I'm heavy in the game right now nigga 
 (But every dog got his day) 
 Straight up 
 And I know 50 just got 400 million right now 
 But I'm gettin' to the money on my own 
 I don't need nothin' right now 
 Its cool to know you got it 
 Holla 
 Young Buck 
 Ca$hville Records nigga 
 We comin' 
 (But every dog got his day) 
 We just got to make sure they put enough zeros on the check 
 Sha Money 
 Man, Dre, you told me I'm a beast 
 Jimmy Iovine 
 Good lookin' on the game man, yeah 
 (I'm not 'gon play with y'all) 
 I'm here now 
 It's been a long time to 
 Now I'm here 
 You niggas 'gon have to kill me to get rid of me 
 (So lets load up an AK) 
 Fuck y'all

 Finish smokin' my weed nigga 
 And I got a bad bitch too

 But she's a bad bitch

 And laugh at these broke ass rappers
