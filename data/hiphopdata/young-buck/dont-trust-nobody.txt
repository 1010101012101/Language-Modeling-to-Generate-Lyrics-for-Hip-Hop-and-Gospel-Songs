(Feat. Hi C & Sosa) 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 I get my work for the low and sell it for the high 
 And I'm hard on a ho damn right I know I'm fly 
 G stand for gangsta 
 U stand for us 
 N stand for niggas 
 And I don't trust nobody 
 Mama told me 
 Trust nobody 
 Daddy told me 
 Trust nobody 
 You know I don't 
 Trust nobody 
 And I don't need nobody 
 (Verse 1: Hi-C) 
 357 Titanium snub nose revolver, the six shooter man I love those 
 I'm in the parking lot strapped when the club close 
 White tee, Ricky Sooner yeah my draw glows 
 P-94 Ruger with a rubber grip 
 A couple of shots make his ass do a double flip 
 I don't trust no nigga as far as I can throw him 
 He tried to play me like a ho so I had to show him 
 (Verse 2: Sosa/Young Buck) 
 [Sosa:] Sosa the pimp my hos call me daddy though 
 [Young Buck:] Six hundred pounds on my big brother's patio 
 [Sosa:] When I'm in New York my niggas they get at me yo 
 [Young Buck:] Holla at me ho 
 [Sosa:] A passport player still keep a Cali-Co 
 [Young Buck:] And for protection I ain't lookin' for no 
 [Sosa:] But if your homie got a problem this the antidote 
 [Young Buck:] Bust his motherfuckin' head off 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 I get my work for the low and sell it for the high 
 And I'm hard on a ho damn right I know I'm fly 
 G stand for gangsta 
 U stand for us 
 N stand for niggas 
 And I don't trust nobody 
 Mama told me 
 Trust nobody 
 Daddy told me 
 Trust nobody 
 You know I don't 
 Trust nobody 
 And I don't need nobody 
 (Verse 3: Sosa) 
 S stand for semi automatic 
 T for Tony 
 Hey yo I'm for the drama don't make me have to show you 
 In case you ain't noticed I don't trust myself 
 So stay the fuck from around me unless you 
 Yeah its Ca$hville Ten-A-Key 
 Glass filled with Hennessey 
 I bet my album budget won't let a nigga injure me 
 And I'm into beats somethin' like a butcher man 
 Eastside pusher man 
 Show you how to cook them grams 
 I take a grand 
 Bought a zip and a half 
 Three years later I'm buyin' shit niggas wish they had 
 I'm just a street nigga fuckin' with rap 
 Buck got it other than that 
 I don't fuck with it 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 I get my work for the low and sell it for the high 
 And I'm hard on a ho damn right I know I'm fly 
 G stand for gangsta 
 U stand for us 
 N stand for niggas 
 And I don't trust nobody 
 Mama told me 
 Trust nobody 
 Daddy told me 
 Trust nobody 
 You know I don't 
 Trust nobody 
 And I don't need nobody
