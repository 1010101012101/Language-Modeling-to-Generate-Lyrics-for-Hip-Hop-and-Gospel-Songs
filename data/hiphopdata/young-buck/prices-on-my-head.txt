(Chorus-young buck) 
 Why? 
 These niggas want me dead 
 (D-tay) 
 Betta' watch yo step 
 (Young buck) 
 Put prices on my head 
 (D-tay) 
 'Cause I cock my shit, and I pop my shit 
 (Young buck) 
 But I ain't gonna change 
 (D-tay) 
 I don't play that shit 
 (Young buck) 
 G-unit do ya' thang 
 (Young buck) 
 These niggas want me dead 
 (D-tay)

 (Young buck) 
 G-unit do ya' thang 
 (Verse one-young buck) 
 Some say I'm crazy for signin with 50 cent 
 Them same niggas wouldn't offer to give me shit 
 Niggas hate you when you rich, but love when you broke 
 I never knew I had so many enemies before 
 My arm's is open to anyone who want beef 
 I promise y'all I won't sleep, till y'all layin 6 ft. 
 G-unit that's what it is, that's what it's gon' be 
 Benzino or the source can't hold me 
 I been heavensent to put a end to this nonsense 
 The handle of this 4-5'll make him unconscious 
 Most of these rappers, throw bricks, and hide they head 
 Come to our shows, then hide behind they man, they homie 
 I understand I'm a target, I'm on top 
 But understand if you start it, I'm gon' pop 
 I'm not and artist, buck is a street pharmast 
 One of the smartest, that gon' get money regardless 
 (Chorus-young buck) 
 Why?

 G-unit do ya' thang 
 (Verse two-lloyd banks) 
 My eyes low, hydro leakin' out that tahoe 
 I know g-unit's them niggas I'm'a ride fo' 
 Nah hoe, I ain't stuntin', nothing that these niggas say 
 Fuck the rap, I can get ya' monkey ass good today 
 Ain't nobody picked me up, when I was pinned down 
 I'm double checkin', 'for I leave outta my crib now 
 Holdin' that 40 on me, sunk in the seat 
 'Cause niggas feel comfortable when they get in drunk with the heat 
 I'm ridin' while ya dirty, 'cause they gunnin for my top 
 I ain't duckin and dodgin, I'm only runnin' from the cops 
 Spendin grand by the grand by hundred on my watch 
 Just got another buddy, and it holds a 100 shots 
 I never had a role model, 'cause he was in a box 
 So I'm up in the club with eather, a heater or a house 
 Everyday there's another nigga bleedin on the block 
 But we ridin' with them burners on, even when it's hot 
 (Chorus-young buck) 
 Why? 
 These niggas want me dead 
 (D-tay) 
 Betta' watch yo step

 (Young buck) 
 G-unit do ya' thang 
 (Verse three-young buck) 
 You see these niggas get out the pen, and think it's good 
 Go get a pack, and come right back, to the same hood 
 They think these young niggas gon let 'em post up, and let 'em get it 
 Ain't been home but 6 months, and got his wig splitted 
 Comitted to the block, fuck these niggas, fuck the cops 
 Fuck these bitches, fuck ya' chain, fuck ya' car, fuck ya' watch 
 Ride and I die for mine, pop's, and I hide the nine 
 Swerving over these white lines, wonderin from the one time 
 Thug and I know I am, bird from a half a gram 
 Broke, so I sold dope, and I'd do it again 
 Don't blame that nigga for runnin' up in my house, fool 
 Ain't no food in my daughter mouth, I'm goin' out too 
 Just think about what your doin', 'cause buddy, bullets burn 
 May god bless his ass, that was that nigga's turn 
 I'm not concerned with your death threats 
 You come down here with that shit, and get left wet 
 Muthafucka
