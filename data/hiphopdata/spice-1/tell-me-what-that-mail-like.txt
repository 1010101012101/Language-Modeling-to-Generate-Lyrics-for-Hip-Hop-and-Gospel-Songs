 Hoppin' out a goddamn 94 Cherokee 
 Dumpin' shit like a muthafuckin' cooper scoop a 
 Nigga off his feet with the millami the Ruger 
 So tell me what that mail like 
 I keep processin' of the yeah for cells [?] tell like 
 Throw away Gats bubble gum pimps 
 And 2 dollar bitches on my nut sack 
 And it was all a part of being young 
 My little nuts hung 
 Fascinated by the Tommy gun 
 Niggas throwin' up sets this is murder tonight 
 But fuck that shit nigga

 Po-Po's wanna quiet me 
 'Cause I was tearin' up shit like the muthafuckin' liar G 
 Wax and Tat's from my nigga Andrew Jackson 
 Movin' ki's in large fractions 
 And this is the American dream 
 To a young muthafucka age 13 to 19 
 He used to be my best friend 
 But the system got us bustin' at each other over Franklin 
 And that little white bitch got the whole world smoked up 
 And then it be causin' them niggas to loc up 
 Smokin' muthafuckas 'cause they asked me: 
 Ay, nigga, do your momma smoke D

 Real last niggas can you feel it

 Gotta live up to my rap as a G 
 Still countin' mail age 23 
 See me and Franklin they can't stop us 
 And now I got no friends I done smoked all my patnas 
 I never thought that the money will definitely kill y'all 
 4 lil' young muthafuckas robbin' liquor stores 
 It's all good patna get your cash 
 Till one of them got panicky and started to blast 
 I took 2 to the chest and 1 to the gut 
 Lyin' on the ground confused as fucked 
 I guess it had to take the bullet 
 To prove that the way I grew up was bullshit 
 Lucky for me I had my vest on 
 'Cause I wouldn't look too gritty with my chest gone 
 Fool, and I'm back I'll be slangin' them D 
 Got a nut in my pocket way unleased a G 
 See I'm a soldier in the shit you can tell right, nigga
