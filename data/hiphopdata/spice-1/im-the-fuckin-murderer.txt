"Heh, heh, heh heh listen, studio gangsta, studio gangsta 
 Studio gangsta, haven't you ever heard of a killa" 
 Ring-a-ding-a-ling I'm caught off 
 In this thang with the mutha fuckin' sawed off 
 Niggas that sleep don't wake up 
 'Cause I'll put the gauge to your nuts 
 Have ya caughin' up piss and blood 
 Mark ass niggas don't get no love 
 The evil ass nigga from the f-a-c 
 Bustin' out the hersh with the g-a-t 
 I went to my nigga on the okland block 
 He passed me the glock said shoot the cop 
 Shit went crazy when I spilt the pig 
 Piggy in a blanet that's what we did 
 Ran down the alley hotwired a broham 
 Flashbacks of a bloody cop suckin' the chrome 
 I'm lookin' up at me nigga and his name is g 
 G cocked the glock and looked back at me 
 Me say my name is spice 1 I never heard a ya 
 My name is spice 1 I never heard a ya 
 My name is spice 1 I never heard a ya 
 But a, 187 is a murdera, byd-a-bye bye 
 (I'm the fuckin' murdera, I'm the fuckin' murdera 
 Haven't you ever heard of a killa) ---rbx 
 You see I roll down the ra-a-roll down the ba-a-block 
 Hand on the ha-a-hand on the ga-a-glock 
 Seventa-a-ta-a-teen sha-a-sha-a-shots 
 Seventeen na-a-niggas pa-a-pa-a-popped 
 My name is spa-a-spa-a-spice wiggedy-wa-a-one 
 My uzi wa-a-wa-a-weigh a ta-a-ta-a-ton 
 I kicks the ra-a-ra-a-red ra-a-ra-a-rum 
 And leave your ba-a-ba-a-body na-a-na-a-numb 
 So keep a nigga ka-a-keep a nigga ca-a-car 
 Lookin' for the la-a-lookin' for the ba-a-bar 
 Sell me a sa-a-sell me another o 
 Scatter from the pa-a-po pa-a-pa-a-poe 
 Hurry up and break this nigga for his keyes 
 Because his glizock is at my ba-a-balls I'm fa-a-freeze 
 The nigga with the na-a-nigga with the na-a-nine 
 Flatt mutha fuckin' flatt mutha fuckin' nine

 Niggas da-a-da-a-don't understa-a-stand 
 I'm a ma-a-ma-a-mad ma-a-ma-a-man 
 Killin' for the ka-a-killin' for the ka-a-keyes 
 Keyes ka-a-ka-a-keyes ja-a-ja-a-g's 
 Dump a nigga da-a-dump a nigga in a ditch 
 380 on that na-a-nigga ass ba-a-bitch 
 Smobbin' wit the sma-a-smobbin' wit the ma-a-mug 
 Livin' like a la-a-livin' like a tha-a-thug 
 Gattin' niggas ga-a-gattin' niggas stra-a-strong 
 Uzi sa-a-sa-a-sang a sa-a-sa-a-song 
 Da-a-da-a-da-a-death wa-a-wa-a-wish 
 A cappin' ya a ca-a-cappin' ya out the dish 
 Whan a na-a-na-a-nigga sla-a-sla-a-slip 
 This hollow ha-a-ha-a-hollow ta-a-ta-a-tip 
 There ain't no safety on this double limb 
 I got seventeen shots one for you and one for all a them 
 Hos pushin' up daisies niggas can't fade me 
 I told you I was crazy ho, but no 
 You wanna fuck wit the gat rata-tat-tat 
 Murder fac and it's like that nigga shatt-ed
