Coolin on the corner with the cellular phone you can tell that the East 
 Bay was his home 
 More mail than the rest of the pushers, 'cause he's got a technine in the 
 Bushes 
 And that's how the shit was handled, first name Jack, last name Daniels 
 Had two boys named E and J, E had the nine and J the AK 
 Clocked on a street called Hennessey, robs with a mother fucker named 
 O.E. 
 E had a bitch and her name was Gin, had a nigga named Juice doin' time 
 In the pen 
 You couldn't tell that Gin was a bitch though, 'cause she was fuckin' some 
 Nigga named Cisco 
 E and J knew tonight they'd come with two fat niggas named Bacardi and 
 Rum 
 The cap jacks hoe and the sight was scary, the bitch was all bloody 
 And her name was Mary 
 Officer Martini wiped up the body, and all fingers pointed at Rum and 
 Bacardi 
 E and J told Jack the hotel, so Jack tried to bail Juice out of the jail 
 But ol' E had the judge on the payroll clout, so Jack shot the judge up 
 And rolled Juice out 
 Now everybody's talking 'bout Gin and Juice, Juice shot Gin 'cause the 
 Bitch was loose 
 Now E is shook thinkin' they ain't gonna get me, I'll round up the posse 
 And call up Mickey 
 Mickey was big, he only sold 8 balls, had 99 niggas up against the wall 
 E and J found out he made the call so E and J and Jack and Juice nined 
 Them all 
 They were sent to the morgue and Mickey paid the bill, got the money 
 From the bitch (?reckless?) Strawberry Hill 
 Jack and Juice said Mickey wouldn't survive, but Mickey was slick he 
 Had a Colt 45 
 And now he's wonderin how he got the word, it was the neighborhood wino 
 Thunderbird 
 You wonder how the murder rap got so much juice, it was a hundred and 
 Eighty-seven proof, Check it out 
 Mickey sent St. Ides after Thunderbird, time for the Hurricane he said 
 Word 
 Thunderbird in an alley waitin, wearin a beanie, tryin' to get a sip 
 From the cop Mr Martini 
 St. Ides screwed off Thunderbird's top, spilled his drank and gave a 
 Swig to the cop 
 But it's too late Martini knows it all, Mickey and his boy OD were 
 Slangin 8 balls 
 Of cocaine to the strawberries on the hill, so when he asked for Juice 
 He got a quick fill 
 Mickey had his boy on Bourbon Blocks, the murderous cop killer Mr 
 Peppermint Schnapps 
 Mickey had this thing about nosey cops and it made Mr Peppermint lose 
 His top 
 Martini off duty waitin for the Night Train, didn't know his wife 
 Champaign would never see him again 
 Peppermint Schnapps creepin' with the Colt 45, gotta peel his cap before 
 The train arrives 
 Gotta stay low in Broward here comes the train all the boys said the 
 Engineers Bartles and Jaymes 
 There was a toot from the train and then a gun blast, Martini fell on 
 The ground there was a big splash 
 Mr Schnapps got up because the cops chased him, St. Ides and Mickey in 
 A 'vette ready in front of the station 
 But you know Jack and Juice was undercover, and Jack was mad B 'cause 
 Mickey shot his lover 
 There was big shootout and Mickey got juiced, he couldn't hang with the 
 1-8-7 proof 
 Juice was splattered and St. Ides had took a fall, and then Endo smoked 
 'Em all
