(* Original lyrics by Ice Cube *) 
 Drop a old school beat 
 Ha-ha 
 Ha-ha-ha-ha 
 Plow! 
 Now the taste of Crystal is fillin up my bladder 
 What's the time on the rolie? It don't matter 
 Had a pocket full of phone numbers I was tryin' to sort 
 To make a long story short: 
 Ran into this girl named Sally 
 Knew her from the backseat of my homeboy's Navi 
 She said what's up, yeah, what's the deal? 
 Check the nappy weave, of course it ain't real 
 Then I looked down, she was fat in the front 
 I asked how long, she said, "About 6 months" 
 "Oh, how time flies when you're havin' fun" 
 She said, "Yeah, but the damage is done" 
 "Where you been?" "On a little vacation" 
 "Oh, by the way, congratulations 
 Who's the lucky man?" She said, "I got him on file" 
 Then she said, "It's Spice 1", and smiled 
 I dropped my stout, then everything went blank 
 "Had a baby by you, the neighborhood skank?" 
 She said, "Yeah, don't you remember that day?" 
 I thought back and tried to calculate 
 Then I said, "Damn, are you sure it's mine? 
 My homies did the Soultrain on ya plenty of times" 
 She said, "That day, nah, I was whorin 
 And your ass is mine", that's when the sweat started pourin 
 Cause all I seen was Spice 1 up in court 
 Paying a gang on child support 
 Then I thought deep about givin' up the fetti 
 What I need to do is kick the bitch in the belly 
 Nah, 'cause then I'd really be faded 
 That's murder one, cause it was premeditated 
 What should I do? Kidnap the bitch and flee? 
 How many months left? Damn, only 3 
 I'm gettin' faded 
 Goddamn, what the fuck I done got myself into? 
 This shit is dense
