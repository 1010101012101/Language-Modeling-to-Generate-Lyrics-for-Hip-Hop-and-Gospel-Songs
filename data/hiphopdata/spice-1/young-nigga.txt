Y'all ready to do this shit? 
 Bust em 
 When I was young I had the lust to pull the trigger 
 And make change out a 5-dollar-ass nigga 
 And as time went on, I gained much love 
 But seein niggas' guts bust at a nightclub 
 Too young to get my ass in, but they didn't trip 
 'Cause if I didn't get in, they knew I'd start shit 
 So I was treated like the muthafuckin pope 
 Security see me, so they scope 
 And follow me around like a flock of hoes 
 I had a squab with a bitch with a big-ass nose 
 I started to knock the bitch out, but before I could 
 I'm stopped short by a redneck peckerwood 
 But he was slow, with the other hand slapped the hoe 
 Then security rushed us out the backdo' 
 So when I grabbed the nine, they thought I'd go nuts 
 I'd roll by and bust caps at the grown-up's 
 Young nigga got bold and off the liquor 
 As a young nigga
