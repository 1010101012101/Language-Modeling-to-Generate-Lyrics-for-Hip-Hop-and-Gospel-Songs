 Here I come steppin'

 Cappin' off safety 
 Keep one in tha chamber

 Handcuffing tha m-i-c 
 Serving niggaz like miky d's 
 Mo' action's than jackson

 Shooting rhymes like john paxson 
 And don't forget 
 Tha lights on tha carmera 
 So I lick 'em 
 Stick 'em

 Dun 'em 
 Get mo' mellow than I trail 'em 
 To tha darkside 
 And make 'em evacuate wit tha sickness 
 Killin' my fatal flow wit tha quickness
