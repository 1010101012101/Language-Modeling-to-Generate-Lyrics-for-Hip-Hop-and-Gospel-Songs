(Spice 1) 
 Four years ago I was stuck on the grind 
 Slangin' crack 50 sacks straight 20's and dimes 
 Till I came with shit that got a muthafucka known 
 Coolin' on the corner with the cellular phone 
 Took a test to be a muthafuckin' g 
 And all the niggas came amazed at me 
 Since the age of 16 I been slangin' the crack 
 The fiends used to scream for my muthafuckin' sacks 
 I used to cut the lleyo down to the bone 
 But now I'm killin' niggas on the microphone 
 Sp-spice 1 kickin' shit to mass 
 A hennessy lemon squeeze and bubble bath 
 You see that's the life that I lead 
 I put a slug in a nigga try to fuck with me 
 So step back move back niggas try to jack 
 But ain't no muthafuckin' love I put you on your back 
 Start some shit at the party first nigga to glance 
 I pull out my glock and make him piss in his pants 
 No shorts on a dove I'm tryna come above 
 They call me spice 1 and ain't no muthafuckin' love 
 I said one to the two, two to two three 
 Put a slug in your ass for you to say g 
 The s to the p the I the c-e 
 You sucka ass niggas can't fuck with me 
 (Spice 1): 
 I rolls a gold cherokee nothin' like a seville 
 And when you look up inside you see a nigga that's real 
 So if you see me cruisin' by keep your hands to your side 
 You might catch a slug if I'm on a hoo-ride 
 I said I first come I first served basis 
 Niggas catchin' slugs in a lot of strange places 
 One of a kind for my people's delight 
 And to you sucka ass niggas you just ain't right 
 Because you're snitchin' on your homies be seat up in the pen 
 And niggas wanna stick you if they see your ass again 
 You're hangin' on the ave you're chillin' with the crew 
 But niggas walk away and all the bullets hittin' you 
 (Spice 1): 
 I said one to the two, two to three 
 My DJ xtra-large and g-n-u-t 
 We roll up in the place pointin' straps at your face 
 Tinted windows black hearse gold daytons straight lace 
 Let off rounds you fall down to the ground 
 You sucka ass nigga another dead clown 
 You're a 5 dollar boy and I'm a million dollar player 
 You's a sucka ass nigga I had to spray ya 
 You say you pack a nine and a nine is fine 
 But I'm blowin' out the back of your head from behind 
 I'm comin' from the sickest city around 
 Spittin' some gangsta shit the dirty bay is the town 
 So g-nut and if you're bigger or pack the tight figure 
 Shoot these haters with the strap that you got from that dead nigga 
 {G-nut:} 
 G-n-u-t in the place to be 
 Pimp straight up out a player's university 
 Every since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge 
 Didn't have no mail so I said : 'fuck college!' 
 I'm brown-skinned comin' straight out the stack 
 And the game that I spit'll put your bitch on the back 
 I'm dressed to kill I love to style 
 I'm the MC you know hoe check my file 
 The big-lip nigga for your regard 
 500 dollar spread for the credit card 
 I hit your town then I go back home 
 Break a bitch for her mail bought a cadillac chrome 
 Deep in the cut for all you bitches delight 
 And if a nigga playa-hate he gon have to fight 
 Because when I grind I hits the strip 
 Every time I sell out I buy a brand-new zip 
 It don't take a lot to entertain' 
 And like my nigga method man I'ma bring the pain 
 You can't rock the shop if you high off hop 
 You gotta let a nigga know you'll never stop 
 And your game gotta make a lot of sense 
 You gotta know when to start when the pimpin' begins
