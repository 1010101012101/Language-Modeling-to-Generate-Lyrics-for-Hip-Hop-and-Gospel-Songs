Now don't you run away from my Glock 
 You can't dodge 17 muthafuckin' shots 
 Could somebody pass me a clip and a trigger 
 Walk across the party pistol whip a nigga 
 Shiiit, 
 I'm comin' up at 'em with the .9's the Glocks and Macs 
 And they'll never breathe again like Toni Braxton 
 'Cause I don't see nothing wrooong with a little bummper jack 
 So say "what up?" to the 1-8-7 FAC 
 Nappy head ass muthafuckas wearin' plats 
 Kickin' back like a muthafucka slangin' sacks 
 Ready to peel a nigga cap if they got the nap 
 So if you're funkin' with the FAC 
 Better to stay strapped 
 'Cause we'll be comin' up at your back with the black Gat 
 Nigga, and you be feelin' kinda fucked up 
 When your homie drop, it's simple 
 You can't run away from my Glock 
 Doncha runaway 
 From my Nine 
 There's no place to hide 
 I'm gonna get you by and by 
 Spiggedy One kickin' dat ass with some lay back shit 
 The trigga-happy nigga, I figure 
 Niggas won't wanna step to me 
 If they know I'll be bustin' caps 
 I roll straps niggas take naps 
 'Cause I don't be fuckin' around 
 When it comes to bustin' that steel 
 I'm too real, niggas feeel me 
 When I kick this gangsta ass shit that you never heard 
 But fuck what you heard 
 I smokes niggas like Herb 
 Put your ass smooth on ice 
 So nigga don't be 2 proud to beg 
 For your muthafuckin' life 
 Cause Nine Cali'll make 'em stutter 
 Make 'em drop, nigga 
 You can't run away from my Glock 
 Comin' like the Lench Mobb swingin' on a vine 
 Yellin' out peace to my muthafuckin' Nine 
 Pullin' my cap back ready to serve they ass 
 Givin' a fuck about what the next nigga done up in the past 
 Nigga, I like to let a nigga have a bloody body 
 Don't think I'm bad, no boxin' no karate 
 Just a big fat Gat for them suckas 
 I ain't scared of you muthafuckas 
 Shiiit, and nigga that's how it be 
 "Rollin' with my muthafuckin' strap on the side of me" 
 So don't come at me with that shit 
 'Bout you gon gaffle me up 
 I cock your cranium like the muthafuckin' Snapple and cut nigga 
 So keep your hand on your pistol grip 
 Bullets whistlin' and shit 
 Feel like a fuckin' missile when you hit 
 And I advice you to stay on alert 
 'Cause if you funkin' with my niggas 
 You gon put in some work, nigga 
 Yeah nigga 
 You knew you couldn't fuck wid this G 
 Would you wanna step to me 
 Fo, hoe, haha 
 Spiggedy One whippin' on that ass 
 Ant Banks in the muthafuckin' house 
 My nigga Omar 
 That nigga knocked out muthafucka drunk and shit 
 This nigga Jamar lay down the muthafuckin' studio 
 Drunk than muthafucka 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 But you know one thing 
 Everybody in this muthafucka's strapped 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 And nobody comin' up short 
 So don't try to run away from my Glock 
 Can't dodge 17 muthafuckin' shots 
 1-8-7 thousand G
