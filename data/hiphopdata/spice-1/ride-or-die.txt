 (Verse One: Jay-Z) 
 Aiyyo fuck why'all, niggaz I crush why'all, rush why'all 
 With the four drawn and I touch why'all, plus why'all 
 Little motherfuckers ain't ready for war 
 I seen your team in a Chrysler before, but I forgot? 
 The same rules apply, don't try to switch up your style 
 Why'all niggaz is pumpkin pie, and that's plain as I 
 Much better than you cat, shocked when I got the news that 
 This nigga ready for war, well where that fool at? 
 I bruise wack rap niggaz severely punish them 
 Especially those that get fucked for they publishing, heh 
 Always gotta be the weakest nigga out the crew 
 I probably make more money off yo' album, than you 
 You see the respect I get every time I come through 
 Check your own videos, you'll always be number two 
 Niggaz talkin' real greasy on them R&B records 
 But I'm platinum a million times nigga, check the credits 
 S. Carter, ghost writer, and for the right price 
 I can even make YO' shit tighter 
 I roast niggaz like ya, smoke niggaz like ya 
 Take your little jewels and put the toast to niggaz like ya 
 You know what the fuck we do and why we done it 
 How I bring it to niggaz who, probably want it 
 Keep playin', you gon' find me in your lobby blunted 
 And I don't even smoke nigga, ain't no joke 
 Niggaz cat fightin with Jigga, kickin sneaky shit 
 Makin' little tapes but keepin' it secret 
 'Cause I kick that deep shit that divide your peeps shit 
 Now I don't know if you fuckin' with Jigga 
 Spittin' that weak shit why'all 
 How many why'all want to ride tonight (ride tonight) 
 How many why'all down to die tonight (die tonight) 
 How many why'all want to ride tonight 
 Nigga ride or die or ride or die 
 (Repeat 2X) 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Niggaz don't want it with Jig, cause somethin' got to give 
 I got homes where you hide, I hustle where you live 
 Jigga's the Don, bitches scream "Jigga dandy, 
 Dick is the bomb, about as thick as a arm" 
 Mr. Exxon, gas 'em with the wit and the charm 
 Bitch I'm tryin' to tell you like Nichalous Bond 
 I'm a big cat, listen mami, can you dig that? 
 Cars, jewelry, homes, I did that 
 Oh's, shootouts, keys, I live that 
 Actresses, models, chickenheads, hit that 
 I get stacks and still I kick back 
 And run up on niggaz with the midac, where the shit at? 
 How many why'all want to ride tonight (ride tonight) 
 How many why'all down to die tonight (die tonight) 
 How many why'all want to ride tonight 
 Nigga ride or die or ride or die 
 (Repeat 2X) 
 Time to separate 
 The platinum from the white gold, right from the door 
 The real from the fake, ready rock from the raw 
 The boss from the runners, cats who ride dick 
 From the cats with the numbers, the five from the six 
 I got cop 'n' crash money, pop the dash money 
 Press the button, alluva sudden, glock in the stash money 
 Beef with Jigga, watch yo' ass Money 
 It's El Presidente, top brass money 
 Now I don't flash the steel, I blast for real 
 My motto: you only good as the last nigga you kill 
 I'm here to snatch this meal, nigga that's for real 
 If you rollin' with me grab the wheel, let's ride huh? 
 How many why'all want to ride tonight (ride tonight) 
 How many why'all down to die tonight (die tonight) 
 How many why'all want to ride tonight 
 Nigga ride or die or ride or die 
 (Repeat 4X
