Welcome to the ghetto, and this is the place, young niggas be throwin' 
 They rocks up in my face 
 My homey G be yellin' yo this like a holdup, I'm pullin my gat to make 
 A mutha fucka fold up 
 In my Jag on my phone talkin' business, Mac 10 to my dome Yo what is this 
 I'm tellin' him drop it Yo let's box and we can go a round, he dropped 
 His gat I picked it up and blew his ass down 
 I know it's scandalous but a simple fuckin' dirty fact, I'd rather hear 
 My Uzi rat-a-ta-ta-tat-tat 
 It's for protection not to kill or break a nigga's bones, back to the 
 Story, here's the story B the story on 
 His guts were scattered he was splattered up against the wall, my homey 
 G was on my phone buggin off my call 
 I tried to smash but I'm lookin' at some high beams into the eyes of 
 Some mutha fuckin' dope fiend 
 He seen me shoot him so I shot him blew his ass off, I shot my Uzi up 
 In the air and then I smashed off 
 I'm rollin' thicker than a milkshake, I like to eat crab but I prefer 
 Steak 
 I ain't no joke mutha fucka so don't play yourself, I flip you over fry 
 Your ass like a patty melt 
 And if you ever disrespect me I'ma bank ya, so say what up to the 
 Mutha fuckin' east bay gangsta 
 Meneme forgot to use my nine 'cause 5-0 bombed the AK, the 187 posse 
 Robbed the bank in a way. Legal or illegal it's the way of the bay. The 
 Government keep the profit of cocaine in a way. Me shootin up me 
 Shootin up if he don't give me my pay The niggas up on the block send 
 For me every day. A thousand everyday will keep the 5-0 away. Just 
 Call me east bay G-A-N-G-S-T-A 
 Looked in my mirror cose range right behind me, tinted windows up in 
 The Benz 190 
 I ain't no dummy knew right off he's tryin' to kill me, if I don't smash 
 Full of buckshot he will fill me 
 Hangin' out the car shots scatter windows shatter trouble, I'll shoot 
 Him up bathed in his blood like Mr Bubble 
 187 did I do it with an AK, another day a nigga dead up in the 
 Alleyway 
 Why did I do it, it's my pistol and I packed it, I think they need to 
 Lock my ass up in a straightjacket 
 So all you suckas listen close to this warnin, while I get into your 
 Ass like Charmin

 The block. The X the L the A the R-G-E, the murder fac 187 posse. The 
 E-A-Ski is with 187, the CMT is with 187 
 Now as I'm maxin in this mutha fuckin' jail cell, with nothin' but dried 
 Up funk to smell 
 I thinkin' about the times that I ganked fools and why I'm coolin in 
 These fucked up county blues 
 I 've murder mutha fuckas singular and in a pair, and in the morning 
 I'll be getting the electric chair 
 But do I care, Yo I could give a fuck less, the CIA, FBI got it in the 
 Chest 
 Tappin my phone calls, wires hidden in my walls, I had the money flowin 
 Smooth like Niagara Falls 
 The glory got so I'm considered a murderous criminal, because my bullet 
 Ate his ass like a cannibal 
 Before I chopped him with AK I made him say his grace, and then I 
 Emptied the clip off up in his fuckin' face 
 His partner callin for backup as I was breakin out, nigga refused to 
 Die, that's what I heard him shout 
 I hit the corner with quickness because I ain't the one, to feel the 
 Fuckin' blast of a shotgun 
 And when they fry my ass, I'm goin' straight Hell, that's why I'm kickin 
 You tales of a jail cell
