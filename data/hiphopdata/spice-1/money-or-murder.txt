Rollin' down the block smokin' endo 
 I got the glock and I'm headed for the liquor sto' 
 Rollin' up slowly, feelin' on my gold teeth 
 And one of these niggas said they know me 
 He looked kinda familiar 
 But nigga, don't step too close, I might kill ya 
 I couldn't really tell who he was 
 But I ain't really trippin', cause the dank got a nigga buzzed 
 I hop out of my shit and lock the car do' 
 As I step into the store I'm starin' at some hard hoe 
 She said 'wassup', like a nigga, to me 
 I walked to the back and fired up my doobie 
 Should I get St. Ides or Olde E? 
 Looked up, some niggas runnin' at me, 'bout 4 deep 
 Runnin' up on Spice 1 ain't wise 
 Whip a nigga ass with some St. Ides 
 Ran up out the liquor store 
 Grabbed my gat and licked a hoe 
 Now what they wanna start shittin fo'? 
 Now if the bitch wasn't tough, I wouldn'ta have to hurt her 
 But fuck that shit when it's money or murder 
 Money or murder
