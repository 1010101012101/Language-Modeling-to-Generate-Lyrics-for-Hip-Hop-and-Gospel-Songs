 Everyday Is A Holiday, anutha muthafuckin dollar day [x4] 
 Check this out 
 Call me Dr. strange, I be in tha lab 
 Cause talkin' on a musical style 
 Put it up, you get doubled for what you pay for 
 I got plenty skils and it chills see 
 As we creap through da city AT-ail 
 All this shit ain't pretty, well I cock my glock back 
 If you hot a junkie got to tell where da rock ya set 
 All apartments got dope spillaz 
 And they servin', watchin out for 12 squealaz 
 And well Atlanta's goin' up, Atlanta's goin' down 
 I bring the sound and I found a betta way 
 Sometimes a nigga gotta do like Barbie and Ken away 
 Since I gotta stay 
 Unemployed niggaz don't pull it far 
 If it weren't for this music dope, I wouldn't have no job

 Check this out, keep all quarter cutted up 
 Lookin' at da rocks in da sack, had his pockets from bein flat 
 Broke anutha choke off this dutch, I won't stop smokin' bluntz 
 I need some French chumps, 
 I bring the funk with swaids of the tongue, When I say whatz up 
 You know where I'm from 
 This watch survival tear, rappin' iz da way to get it off my chest 
 Can't let this stress bleed, rollin' through these swats again 
 Made many, many muthafuckin new friendz 
 When I was 20 dope, I gotta get this flow, doin' shows 
 See some G'z out in queens for the fed G'z 
 And let the toxin ease yo pain, where all the niggaz at wit all tha gang 
 See all the kings in choice of power, this iz our hour 
 Poppin' wide, listenin to this line
