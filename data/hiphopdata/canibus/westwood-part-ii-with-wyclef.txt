(Canibus) 
 Yeah, check it, 
 Yo, yo, yo, 
 The secret of the ages I illuminate with logic 
 What I speak is more than just deep, it's bottomless 
 With common sense I'm organized like crime and mafias 
 Plus the way I rhyme is prime, like Optimus 
 A rapologist you could sit and do the knowledge with 
 From G-E-D's to degrees from Ivy-League colleges 
 I'll politic with any magazine columnist 
 About topics other emcees won't even bother with 
 Rock-solid shit like stones and monuments 
 It's obvious the third eye of the obelisk is watching us 
 Closely, through a microscope and a pair of binoculars 
 Ghetto scholars like me who study street calculus 
 I utilize every letter of the Arabic alphabet 
 To touch a part of your body that makes you feel erogenous 
 Yo, yo, 
 I drink a gallon of the ginseng extract 
 Harness all my lyrical power to rip tracks 
 I shed light upon pitch black 
 So at times even your third eye finds my rhymes too bright to glimpse at 
 I think back to before I was born 
 When suckers wasn't even involved in this art form 
 Now they write rhymes that reflect nothing but hard times 
 While I be on America Online 
 Electronically mailing my thoughts across the information highway 
 Trying to communicate with Yahweh 
 Discovering shit that make a nigga bug 
 I speak a language that don't even require the tongue 
 Raps carry the impact of a sawed-off 
 Get in my face and your liable to get yours blown off 
 I'm a showoff, everybody up north knows I'm the best 
 LL couldn't bring it to me if he had my home address 
 Much less defeat me, you must be taking steroids and not eating your Wheaties 
 And smoking crack instead of beedies 
 Step in the ring, I'll put you through pain you never been through 
 Torture will force you to tap-out so I don't have to pin you 
 You see, my style will get in you like an injection 
 Lyrical ooze causing rap crews to become ex (X)-men 
 Infecting emcees with a disease there's no cure for 
 No man can withstand a Canibus metaphor 
 I'll freak a rhyme until your sampler stops counting the bars 
 And delegate laws as if I'm God 
 So call me arrogant if you want to 
 But The Canibus creates cyphers niggas can bring a lighter and a blunt to 
 Uncle Sam wants you but he don't want me 
 'Cause lyrically I'm too advanced for you average emcees 
 My field of force is bigger than twenty golf courses 
 Eerie like government theories behind flying saucers 
 I go on and on and on for hours 
 Till batteries die then I spit to auxiliary power 
 We're strong soldiers, it's no lie 
 We don't die, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
