Ten below, snow cammo's, four commandos 
 Standing in the snow practicing hand-throws 
 I put him in the bulletproof straight-jacket 
 Faced backwards, in positions like that, space matters 
 Sit back and think, smoke rise from the vent 
 After one solid attempt I polish the end 
 The Event Horizon event 
 I stayed behind, five of them went, I keep rhyming so I can see them again 
 The verbal architect walk to Tibet, catch your breath 
 We haven't started marching yet, you're in the company of honored vets 
 I see more depth than Imhotep 
 I see no death, that's why I ain't no hero yet 
 Translate the text, I throw scrolls, you fetch 
 My style is not even something unknown yet 
 Initiate the pre-warm-up, I walk up 
 Who want what? The metaphor rush with no shortcuts 
 Search the boondocks for moon-rocks 
 'Channel Zero' playing out my boom-box 
 Looking at the lunar-clock 
 Rapidly map the galaxy, unlock reality 
 With a six-point star Allen-key 
 Travel with me 
 The crew drink buccaneer brew 
 Buck you from a distance, hit you if you near too 
 Snipe you with a rifle through the bright-blue night-view 
 The hawk's tooth is proof of what I might do 
 Who the nigga with the small wrists talking shit, balling his fists? 
 They call him 'Bis, why they all on his dick? 
 I got a Hip-Hop badge I don't like to flash 
 Better talk slow, homie, I don't type fast 
 We rock forever, turn forever into eight nevers 
 Them niggas sell a lot of records but they ain't better 
 We hire soldiers to blow you up with high explosives 
 Make sure that you die in focus 
 The low-level hum of African kettle-drums 
 Metal guns flash heat like the Sun, rebels run 
 From the three-way CIHB trace my A 
 Might have enriched plutonium in three days 
 Speak bars like retards with precog 
 With a handful of B 
 The intellectual festival rhyme incredible 
 Discharged on a medical, the tour was terrible 
 Don't touch my genitals, thank you General 
 C my pen is a quill, my sense is to kill 
 C 'N D reinvent the wheel 
 Rhymes stand at attention till I tell them to chill 
 Stand on the ledge of the hill 
 They kill who I tell them to kill 
 Hot-wire transfer the rest of the bill 
 I give conjugal visits to my own lyrics 
 Fuck what the beat sounds like the poem fits it 
 Don't get it twisted, Canibus ain't getting jiggy with it 
 I'm just dumbing it down for a minute 
 I was deployed at two-forty Bravo Beach Boy 
 The hotel Hanoi decoy with a deep voice 
 Stab a rap fiend with atraphine 
 To bring it back from the dream, to interact with the team 
 Nuclear-Defense level-three, dancing with the Devil and me 
 I put some water on the kettle for tea 
 Freestyle heats the coil, turn streets to soil 
 Blue water at beaches boil, laying on a blanket of foil 
 Speech is royal, my saliva is like oil 
 And I'm spoiled like E
