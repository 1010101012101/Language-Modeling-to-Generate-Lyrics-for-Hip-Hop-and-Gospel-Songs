(Canibus) 
 I walk in the room, in the Doctor Doom costume 
 Optic zooms, the plot resumes 
 Trust me, you're the abductee, my trigger-finger touchy 
 Try me; see if you're lucky 
 Play him, slay him, display him, mother fucking mayhem 
 Stupid! You can't contain him, 'cause you trained him 
 Love the bad weather, freckled-faced lepers 
 Can't go outside; gotta stay together 
 Lodge members don't attempt to announce my name 
 The brown-sage, one-year away from my crown age 
 Count the ways, my sound-waves been downplayed 
 U.S.A. underground made, I live without fame 
 Hard labor for the day the reincarnator 
 Rip your carburetor out your car and chase you 
 I hate you, I'm the Gun Ho city mayor 
 Who's in charge out here? Who's the front face, huh? 
 Bang on you, dumb-slang on you, Can-I get on you 
 Watch who you talk to; my manager warned you 
 Violating, you rhyme weak, you live bait 
 Put you behind the gate with a five-eight primate 
 I improvise, explode, synthesize flows 
 Like your favorite emcee with the wide-nose 
 Command shell is a PSP handheld 
 In real-time speed, I can read my fan-mail 
 Grip the pound, blitz the town, with a two-oh-three round 
 You'll never want that to go down 
 Spin around and shoot at you, hundred-eighty degree copular 
 Attached to my van on Utica 
 Next stop Gun Ho city, nigga, shoot 'em up 
 G Rap, and Can-I-Bus blew 'em up
