Intro: Canibus (Vinnie Paz) 
 Yeah, Canibus, my man Vinnie Paz 
 (Louie Dog, Hannibal, Canibus, Vinnie Paz, yeah) 
 Yeah (Jedi Mind) 
 Canibus 
 An isolated regime that works twice the pace of your team 
 These Jedi Mind Tricks are no dream 
 Kill-code received, you do not need to know what you need 
 You will be uplinked to the feed 
 The entrance to the cave is guarded by a statue of Saint Germain 
 Holding an oil lamp with a purple flame 
 Shuffling down the dark corridor, chasing the voice of the orator 
 The light brightens more and more 
 Your muscles tight and sore 
 You fall to waist height then crawl as you are forced to recite bars 
 From Ars Notoria, what is the origin? 
 Metaphoric euphoria, lobotomize the audience 
 Rap music recruited, those who refuse it 
 Will be uprooted, then electrocuted, then executed 
 Flesh is fluid, physically it's a stretch to do it 
 You wake up cold, wet and wounded playing my music 
 The strong believe in me, the weak try to weaken me 
 But they are not allowed to speak to me that easily 
 The fans get neglected, can't get their favorite record 
 They only get to hear what's selected, not requested 
 They are wasting your time, just think about that 
 The reason you won't think is the reason I won't rap 
 Wisely worded speech, framing technique and thermal heat 
 Bridges the verbal to the beat, providing earth for your feet 
 I rip granite, the Universe shaped like this planet 
 Nobody understand it when my spit is mismanaged 
 Virtuoso Vivaldi, Aleister Crowley 
 With a baldy flow flawlessly, cathedral halls applaud me 
 Red-Three-Delta they call me, in the Red Army Armory 
 Talking softly, walking calmly, the officers saw me 
 Cursing at the bastard commie, pass the salami 
 Rhyming offbeat, they poured me caffeine, not coffee
