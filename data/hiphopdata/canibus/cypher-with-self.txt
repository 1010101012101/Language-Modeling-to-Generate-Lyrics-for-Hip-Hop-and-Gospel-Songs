(Canibus) 
 People ask me what is Lyrical Law, in its most original form 
 Lyrical Law is just a language that I use to describe various components of lyrical fitness, and that was all 
 Then they said they wanted me to brake that down, 'cause I made that style 
 So that's why I'm making this now, I'm gonna show you how, stay with me 
 2011 introspective, Lyrical Law has eleven new merics, 
 Every concept seem separate, but all contact is a self generated effort 
 2011 introspective, Lyrical Law has eleven new merics, 
 Every concept seem separate, but all contact is a self generated effort 
 First lession, check it 
 2011 introspective, Lyrical Law has eleven new merics, 
 Every concept seem separate, but all contact is a self generated effort 
 2011 introspective, Lyrical Law has eleven new merics, 
 Every concept seem separate, but all contact with a higher power is a message 
 I said it, all contact with a higher power is a rare credit, only angels on the guest list 
 (Urban Rose) 
 We've had enough of the lies 
 We won't keep believing your disguise 
 Ain't no way to break through 
 If you keep believing what they tell you 
 'Cause when you wake up in the morning and you can't even breathe 
 So much stress on your chest you just got to buckle to you knees 
 Our lungs are shattered, shattered from the rage 
 We don't give a fuck, we gon scream it anyway 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, Lyrical Law flow, open the hyperdimensional window 
 The cold is a node, unbenounced 
 Lightening bolts that branch out fangs to the throat 
 You can't speak on the truth 'cause you're a mainstream ho 
 From the dirt floor in the hut, to the mansion on stilts and struts 
 They are alive, but they haven't lived much 
 It's almost time to get in touch, they will whine and discuss 
 This is for they're own good, Canibus 
 Hip Hop, what a rush, turn sucka MC's to slush, such and such and such 
 Enough, none of them was hits, they was near missed 
 I ain't talking about that, I'm talking about this 
 2012, classified pattens, only the first couple of thousands got to do with rapping 
 I've been rapping since rap happened 
 Half of y'all rappers is tap dancing, oher half of y'all is lap dancing 
 The man in the mirror laughing at the Melatonin Magik 
 Yeah, they all laughing till the Spaceships landed 
 (Urban Rose) 
 Sorrow leads the way 
 Always broken with their wicked mind. 
 They're falling away 
 'Cause there is no truth within their eyes 
 No place, no place to go 
 (Canibus) 
 But not you Canibus, your sorrow will be your advantages 
 But you must control how to channel it 
 4th dimensional shifts are sandwiched 
 Between this reality and a 5th dimensional rift 
 The teacher doesn't talk in anagliphs 
 But you miss understand Canibus, hip hop gave him a chance to exist 
 The most advanced lyricism ever spit 
 And all they keep talking about is some stupid random shit 
 Just talk about the good, stop talking about the bad 
 Cause other peoples business will beat yo ass 
 Somebody new showed up, and we don't like him 
 They bathe in human corpse dismembered to their liking 
 And all I'm doin' is rhyming, That's not violent 
 Imma shut up, to deactivate this bomb we need silence 
 Knowledge, is the reason that we bleed violet 
 The leaders acknowledge this and profit 
 They are the watchers of the prophets 
 Post Apocalyptic, must stop ot 
 Fear is not an emotion, fear is not an option 
 They paralyze your motor skills, I could live without it 
 You call that a thrill? I doubt it!

 (Canibus) 
 Steel cables repel downward to inner mountain 
 Look around it, Sasquash is on my next album 
 The savage lookin' for salvage, Not talkin' about them 
 I'm talkin' about us 
 There's probably only a thousand left 
 Lyrical Law is your only outlet 
 Get out while you still can and forget about it but don't doubt it 
 I water the garden, the metal growin' out the ground hardens 
 My lyrics give me presidential pardon 
 I serve as the Shepherd and Bro to bring a Message to the Globe 
 This law is the mortar between stones 
 I serve as the Shepherd and Bro to bring a Message to the Globe 
 We are one Soul in separated zones 
 We control our souls and the microphones 
 That control the sound waves that this Law exposes
