That's right Jax attack that beat, a nigga say something tap that cheek 
 Crack his teeth, the bat that beast 
 Canibus attach that Camowrap, rip through tracks 
 The kick back of plastic explosives: Get back 
 Ham radio, handmade radials 
 Waterproof, underwater, sustainable; Saber-tooth 
 Independently controlled, atmosphere capable 
 Lupe lasers to the face disable you 
 Grimy, grungy, coldblooded, gully 
 Ribbety buddies get beat the fuck up for they money 
 Whatever the countries currency, trust me 
 Get stabbed up with a flat rusty... You can't fuck with me! 
 You feel lucky? Throw you in the brig you big dummy 
 Can't take a motherfucking thing from me 
 Leave that ugly pussy all pussy, who was he? 
 I had to gut 'I'm with a four blade Muzzy 
 Jackson on acid, roundhouse axe kick 
 The universe detracted, now you in a casket 
 Half a dozen ways we can do that; pick one 
 Make you drink an oil drum full of fish chum 
 Strangle you with your own tongue, make you snorkel where I piss from 
 Nigga, try to swim with a split lung 
 Jellyfish belly, I rip you up 
 Javelin Fangz'll bite you and stitch you up 
 Coast Guard Prowler circlin' the lighthouse every hour 
 Gunshots shower down from the clock-towers 
 Sniff the gunpowder, the rifle high-powered 
 You a coward, I'm a turtle-back nigga full of solar panels 
 Triple digit temperature lyrics, and you gravitic 
 I live it, I spit it, admit it, you a gimmick 
 Falling, failing, you can't prevail: The hip-hop vagrant 
 I sink you while you sailing, while you say cadence
