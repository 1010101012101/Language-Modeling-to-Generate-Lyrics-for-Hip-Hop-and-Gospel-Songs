 Yo 
 I dialogue with Amen-Ra 'til he gives me the nod 
 And replaces me with a supercomputer automaton 
 I don't barter for time I'm a martyr to rhymes 
 And a selfless soldier with pride that was ordered to die 
 A burning star in the sky, my heart is warped with a drive 
 Expressing thoughts through a rhyme, my metaphors are alive 
 It's like I've been crucified, they 'Hate Me Now' like Nas 
 They punctured me through my side, the bleeding was cauterized 
 I was revived after I died 
 Only then I saw how I was truly admired and worshipped like a god 
 It had mired up my mind and showed me a sign 
 I fell off the ocean liner, someone throw me a line 
 Let the world know the truth but it became my demise 
 You know we're even I don't owe you a dime 
 Sometimes I feel like killing myself, they've stolen my shine 
 I wanted to be the illest for a moment in time 
 From the ink to my pen to my pad to the ink in my arm 
 How could one diss song possibly last this long? 
 Tyson ain't the champ no more, them days is gone 
 And Rip the Jacker ain't too stubborn to say when he's wrong 
 (Canibus) 
 I should get twenty dollars and go to Econolodge 
 And tie the sawed-off's trigger around the doorknob 
 Call the police squad and tell them I'm in room 1-0-5 
 And that a dirty bomb's inside 
 Woke up in the cargo plane 
 Playing Christy Lane for some entertainment while I train in the misty rain 
 'One Day at a Time, Sweet Jesus' is playing 
 I'm sitting there praying, you probably can't believe what I'm saying 
 But the voice in the back of my head keeps saying, "Germaine 
 This is the real deal, man. This is not a dream. This is not a game 
 The only sixteen you've got for now on is locked and loaded and in your hand 
 Deploy and detach on land. You're the man 
 And the pain is the weakness leaving the body, understand?" 
 And reload with a full pack. Call COMSAT 
 Tell them you need suppressive fire for troops in the back, STAT 
 Insurgence and counter-insurgence, move with a purpose 
 Absolutely mission critical, you never get nervous 
 Applicate the shock-tube to the surface 
 Standby! Blow it! Eyes open with your scope on a terrorist 
 Tell him to go to Hell in Arabic 
 Put a bullet through his narrow neck, watch the wall behind him get wet 
 I'm an animal, I'll murder you and stare at your pets 
 Get the tape! I know where the surveillance cameras are kept 
 (Canibus) 
 If you want a confession, you've got it 
 You want product give me twenty dollars 
 You want gossip, I'll give you logic 
 On any topic, recording the positive data 
 Rip is the best rapper, go confirm the status 
 One million page dissertation written on paper 
 Cheap labour for Pitney Bowe's tree curator 
 My purification process is greater but thinly tapered 
 Verbatim, my album is equal to over fifty acres 
 Can-I-Bus before the Big Bang and after the Big Crunch 
 I've only got to say it once 
 Let there be light and I write a sentence 
 The greatest discovery since opethicus afarensis 
 Back to before Sumerians landed on the canyon 
 In the Cambrian carrying bacteria with antigens 
 And nine-foot stone mannequins 
 The key to nuclear power and Porta Libitinaria 
 Showtime at the Gallows, the Age of Aquarius 
 And space harriers, life's last barrier 
 Showtime at the Gallows!
