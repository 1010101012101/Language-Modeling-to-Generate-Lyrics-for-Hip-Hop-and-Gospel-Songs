Canibus, the missing link: what you think? 
 Hip Hop's liaison, in the electric chair w/ chains on, 
 Put me in the mood to brainstorm 
 All my loved ones hold hands and sing songs 
 Stay strong! Smell the napalm: MLK's gone! 
 Post physical pre-calendrical 
 Post spiritual metaphysical visuals in HD digital 
 Synchronized time on my signal 
 When I signal you remember what to do: it's not difficult 
 They got a picture of me on they Code of Arms 
 W/ my '40 belows' on and my clothes burned off 
 The Mountain man's hand are colder than oil pans 
 From disloyal fans that wanna spoil the whole plan 
 I will pick you up and carry you to the next stage of the Hip Hop Age: 
 Do not be afraid! 
 Old and washed up, maybe my time's up; 
 Still spit a rhyme like, "Yeah, now what?" 
 You soft like a bull w/ his balls cut off 
 When you pass me on the highway your car shut off! 
 You are forced to walk: how far you gon get now boss? 
 It doesn't matter if he get caught 
 They chased him so far now you lost 
 It ain't about 16 bars you bought 
 Its about missing links: honorable art 
 Bis bust beautifully, still come off usually 
 You can't out rap me 
 No matter what you or you or you or you 
 You, you, you, you, or you believe: I am a computer that breathes! 
 Imagine every human being in fatigues 
 Ignoring they needs; ignoring the wishes of they seeds 
 Ignoring him, ignoring you, ignoring me 
 In that case, I spit lyrical law metaphors for free! 
 Straight from the demon seed: the demon seed is not me
