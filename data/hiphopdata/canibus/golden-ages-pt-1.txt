In a sort around about way, I put about an album out everyday 
 But I'ma play what the fuck I wanna play 
 I'm FunkMaster Flex this is hot 97 
 The hottest Hip Hop R&B is on suspension 
 Call the warm line I might spits some bars 
 And post songs on ijustlostmyjob.com 
 My contribution was X'ed out, I fell left out 
 But without that I couldn't show you what this shit is about 
 Perfect poetic masterpiece spit heat 
 Itch for beats throw I fit go to sleep until my shits released 
 My speech... sleek, stealth my whole beeps 
 Leather like my belt - I'm top 10 dead or alive! 
 Miss your status briefing and be quite while I'm speaking 
 Nobody is going home this evening - you read me?
