(Intro: 'Gladiator' sample) 
 You have proved your valor yet again 
 Let us hope for the last time 
 But there's no one left to fight, sire 
 There is always somebody left to fight 
 (Knowledge God) 
 Are you an ego monster, writing ten thousand bars? 
 I'll melt your squid face with ten thousand stars 
 Your battle raps dried up like the ass of the Sphinx 
 And your brains fried up my verses make your ball shrink 
 I'll kill you like Marie Curie with Ionizing Radiation 
 You are facing termination by your own creation 
 My metaphors mechanics will toss you off the planet 
 You smoke too much chronic, my vocab is volcanic 
 Infinite beings with black bars, that eat through rap stars 
 Travel time in fast cars, you fire past Mars 
 I ran back home to battle Rip on the phone 
 Right after I cracked Can-I-Bitch with the Mayan Sun Stone 
 You say we'll live without fear for several millions years 
 If you hold hands with your peers like a bunch of queers 
 My Stryker Brigade driver, strike a gay rapper 
 I leave Rip dehydrated with lines of hot lava 
 I tie you up with a snake shaped like a sideways eight 
 And watch you break and suffocate at an unrelenting pace 
 Mechanical skeletal structure was designed with a Heavy Mental 
 Your mind's left behind, it's as light as a feathered quill 
 The Will of Knowledge God controls thoughts and movement 
 And force Can-I-Bitch to eat atomic waste pollutant 
 LL crucified your career with 'The Ripper Strikes Back' 
 I slice you from ear to ear, who's the Jamaican in the body bag? 
 (Canibus) 
 Rip the Jacker quantum creator, the quasar quaker 
 So many layers I can't demonstrate it on paper 
 My melodic emulators cut you down with trachea lasers 
 Of deeply deposited argon vapors 
 My every verse is a psychic institutional burst 
 I choose which layer to listen to first 
 At the peak of the Bell Curve, earthquakes make me misspell words 
 But loud and clear my every verse is well heard 
 They barely understand you 
 The unseen hands that sample you and command you, it's quite puritanical 
 Henry Louis Gates Jr. said I was a lyrical computer 
 A great leader of a spiritual movement 
 Homo Noeticus student, the cosmic human 
 Homo Evolutis, divine rulers from a digital future 
 I'm a poet not a puppet, I spit these rhymes without a budget 
 With more infinite rhymes than cousins 
 Non-periodic comets, halotolonian bubbles in solidified rock deposits 
 When you take the time to unearth what I did 
 You will witness infinity, every verse is a bridge 
 Uneasy lies the head, my crown is too heavy for your men 
 The mixing board got a thousand channels plugged in 
 Music generated user generated mixing board entertainment 
 For you mental entrainment 
 (Canibus) 
 The mic on my arm is symbolic for a knowledge bomb 
 Celestial arms spiral into viral columns 
 I was betrayed the moment you were born 
 And more often than not I say it in my songs 
 All day long I talk about Lyrical Law 
 I reserve the right to say whatever I want 
 If God kisses your face and the Devil kissed your ass 
 Then how come you ain't got no goddamn cash? 
 The breakaway civilization, generation on blast 
 The human population is reduced to ten percent of the half 
 For those who love to laugh 
 Bolides collide with incoming craft 
 The geography is nanoscopic nano-typography 
 If you don't understand don't mock me 
 The midnight lyricist with a one thousand bar cylinders 
 A Ripper's lyricism is unlimited 
 (Canibus) 
 The opening mechanism for the Sphinx is behind the ears 
 But there is freedom behind your fears 
 I am the autistic King Ellipsis who broke the Ecliptic 
 But don't nobody wanna listen 
 After twelve I turned into a Rakim gremlin 
 Bare witness to my lyrical fitness 
 Paranoid chilling Bob Dylan, Hip Hop villain 
 Lyrical Law from the heart of the Dark Lizard King still spitting 
 Killa Gila reptile with poisonous venom 
 Give 'em a pulmonary embolism when the rhythm hit 'em 
 Bus 'em, punishes women and children, whoever wit' 'em 
 The illest alive, still living, still spitting 
 The audio master, blast you with a vocal sample trigger 
 I'm the illest, I'm the illest, I'm the illest 
 They got their plans and we got ours 
 Plus I got my own plans if something goes sour 
 (Canibus) 
 Fast acting bio hazard, my verse is a surface burst 
 Blasting and attacking and backtracking through a massive magnet 
 Global area with a bio location for rappers 
 Vocals powered by zero point magic motors 
 How many times you done this before Bis? 
 Created an album that some love but others dismiss 
 My heir-apparent is trying to hijack Hip Hop 
 Using some fucked up mixing board spirits 
 Everything I've written for my brothers and sisters who still listen 
 This ain't no fricking fake reality vision 
 This a real mission, the real wheels of steel still spinning 
 I laugh, radio DJs ass kissing 
 How far would you go to be a rapper? Ask 'em 
 Beyond the absence of light is only blackness 
 How far would you go to be a rapper? Ask 'em 
 Beyond the absence of light is all blackness 
 (Canibus) 
 Two hundred bars, eleven minutes, eighteen bars per minute 
 Yeah, I still got it, can you fuck with it? 
 Superior rhymes recorded in sidereal time 
 Uncontrived and alive by design 
 Tiger tooth Spiderman diving off the roof 
 Smile, it's the truth when I'm rhyming over loops 
 I'm in a spaceship minus the roof 
 Yeah, a real spaceship, something I designed in my youth 
 Let the world know the truth, 
 That I designed iller records than you 
 I wrote, produced and recorded and released a lot more records than you 
 Just thought that I should get more credit than you 
 'Cause I'm better than you 
 See, you can lie to me but don't lie about me 
 Is that all you got? No wonder you grouchy 
 My lyrics sound horrible, your voice sounds lousy 
 So why you still be up on radio talking 'bout me? 
 (Canibus) 
 Catchphrase me if you can, nobody rhyme like Javelin Fangz 
 I grab the mic with pure knowledge in my hand 
 Jump off the bridge, you fake niggas scram 
 I'll strangle you with dreadlocks and my bear hands 
 Take you to the ground, release no release, I'm a beast 
 Run out of wind? I'll hit you with the piece 
 One, two, three deceased 
 It's already chaos going on in the streets, it's just you and me 
 I'ma make you eat everything you said about the kid 
 Hip Hop's one of those things I'm proud I did 
 I respect your whole catalog and what you've said 
 And I'ma share your legacy with the one's who care 
 They say, "Hip Hop is the greatest story never told" 
 Imagine what it'd look like at a hundred years old 
 You can't use mind control on a timeless soul 
 An emcee's lyrics defines his role 
 (Canibus) 
 Close encounters with the poetic Buddha 
 Outside Infinity City, with programmable life-form producers 
 The Grand Deception, that's what it was 
 The idea of aliens or anatomical subs 
 For dinosaurs that feed off our flesh and blood 
 They worship the Sun, put you to death if you run 
 The serpent from Eden at Glen Rose, Texas museum 
 What's the meaning? They lived alongside human beings 
 Visible photography blends with lomography lens 
 They can't copy, no matter how they pretend 
 The Canibus Man, is just apocalypse in a can 
 But Rip the Jacker spreads soundscapes across the land 
 Constant to your death signals, Hip Hop jingles 
 I could literally kill you with a Hip Hop single 
 SEI is now online, the next verse reverse time 
 I can float a pound of steel with my mind 
 Tesla shield designed, obsessed with unlocking my mind 
 'Cause there is no stopping my kind 
 The photons of life phase conjugation on the mic 
 My rhymes re-materialize as light 
 The lost unified field theory of Maxwell 
 They know I rap, but they didn't know I rap that well 
 I can't deceive you, the truth is out there for the people 
 The lies are transparent to see through 
 I dream the galactic green, the Northern Lights in the skies 
 Uninhibited by the jet stream 
 God is within me, God is within you too 
 And together we will find the truth 
 They said "You ain't the same Rip, Canibus, Poet Laureate" 
 But you never check what Germaine think 
 Project CC-gate spit, comet sized "C" spaceship 
 They so shocked they didn't say shit 
 Lyrical Law is all about the lyrics 
 And it goes a little something like this, hit it
