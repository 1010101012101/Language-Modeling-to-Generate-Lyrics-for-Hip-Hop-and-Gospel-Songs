(Canibus) 
 I've got more rhymes than I do time 
 The lines look like star maps designed by the Dogon tribe 
 Buck teeth chief soothsayer, King Kamehameha 
 Rhyme slayer, my face war painted in five layers 
 Laugh now, die later, cry your creator won't save you 
 Camo makeup means the minds made up 
 Prepare for the impact, brace for the boom 
 Every grid square is consumed by bombs from an air balloon 
 "I George Bush the button" 
 Fucking murder eleven out of a Dirty Dozen and I'm still hunting 
 These rap niggas kissing ass with Lizards 
 I can't wait to give you the business, I typewriter tap triggers 
 Snap bitches like paparazzi snap pictures 
 Attack the whole hit list for half your listeners 
 I don't give a fuck what the public wanna buy 
 That bullshit attract flies, I sanitize 
 Conceptualised wise sideways eight rhymes 
 Since the time Kane flattop rule in '89 
 So come get some little bum 
 You got a lot of money, I got a lot of you know what 
 Fuck the cake, I'ma ration these crumbs 
 When the time comes I won't even take blood 
 I got out the Matrix when I was unplugged 
 The Oracle said, "It will be what it was" 
 I walk upright but I'm savage and uptight 
 And this fucked up life is the reason I crush mics 
 Goals and desires are old and expired 
 Everything I owned was bankrolled in the fire 
 DMC knowledge, give Marco Polo the guidance 
 The saying goes, "No man is an island"
