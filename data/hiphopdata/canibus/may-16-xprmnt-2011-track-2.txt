Konogoro is the language, out here Inugami mountain 
 Out here trying to promote this album 
 Examine the translation; but what's the situation? 
 I thought Hip Hop was the language of many nations 
 A chance at exploration not exploitation 
 We goin' in big circles on some run away slave shit 
 I thwarted the attack, but you don't see it like that 
 Just like you don't see how many verses came outta that track 
 I grab the mic off the mic stand with my Hellboy hand 
 Then I proceed to battle Hell boy's man 
 My father was bitten by a poisonous snake in Guyana 
 He was treated by Birmingham's doctor 
 That's where I learned to play soccer 
 The sun burning hotter outside watching Rap City with the Rasta 
 Grateful and relieved about what has been achieved 
 Not scornful with desires and unabated greed 
 Even the uneducated seed can agree 
 That modern day emcees is not like they used to be 
 I still get busy usually, not in front of everybody 
 Just you and me, I'll show you how it used to be 
 I seeded the planet, Canibus evolution advancement 
 In infinite commandment, what's the advantage? 
 There is none, open your mind, seek out the sun 
 In the background you see a Brown Dwarf on the drums 
 Maharaji, my head Yogi told me 
 I "am not alone not matter how lonely, so walk boldly" 
 Purpose is removed, then sacrifice ignored 
 Hip Hop is restored through Lyrical Law 
 We never been regular rappers, see the names on the nebula ballad 
 Special, lyrical, RTJ tactics 
 He claimed that he'd written the greatest rhyme of all time 
 And NOW is the time to take it out the archives 
 The Adamic Race was created by those who landed from space 
 Atlantis was only one planetary base 
 Appalachia, Terrania, Palencia, Oceania 
 Yeah, shut the fuck up and show me on camera 
 The national reconnaissance guys are disguised 
 As flies that are really micro-electronic spies 
 Flies on the wall that read your thoughts through sub-sonic pulse 
 We're all just better off being quiet, boss
