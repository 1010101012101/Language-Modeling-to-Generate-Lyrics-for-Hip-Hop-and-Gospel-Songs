Yo, I'll take you on a lamplight tour through the hall of metaphors 
 Show you what I sacrificed for 
 My purpose was removed, my rights were ignored 
 Memoirs of an emcee writing and dividing up the bars 
 The '88 sales and the numbers of the stores 
 Who the fuck cares any more? 
 Torture techniques for the street on behalf of the 'Beast from the East' 
 The beast from a place with no peace 
 No relief, no reprieve when I speak 
 Don't breathe, don't even know how my flow is received 
 The emcee of a special breed that has special needs 
 Completely unproportional to his specialities 
 I jump on stages, the crowd move while I call cadence 
 I sound familiar 'cause I'm famous 
 Germaine John Wayne McCain before Obama came 
 I told them stiff arms help the aim 
 Conduct is unbecoming, this emcee is trying to spit something 
 The rest of y'all ain't saying nothing 
 Shaka Amazulu, old school voodoo from a new school guru 
 Let me introduce you 
 Canibus, the flow is deep so the speak 
 Crypto-complex coded speech over the beat 
 No relief, there is only retreat 
 For emcees who don't flow like me, there is only defeat 
 I take you beyond the blitzkrieg verse and back 
 You might collapse when I bust my raps, just perhaps
