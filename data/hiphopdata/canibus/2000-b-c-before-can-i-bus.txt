(Canibus) 
 Yo, my offense is a mixture of Mike and Mohammed 
 Knock a nigga unconscious, and talk shit 
 In bare-knuckle boxing, speed is the object 
 Weaving and dodging, with defensive blocking 
 So in the ring, you cannot win 
 The top ten become nine dead, if I ever decide to hop in 
 With the one-two, one-two, shot to the chin 
 Knock you out like ten shots of Vodka and Gin 
 The beautiful blend, the power of strength 
 From the top of my head, down to where my toe cuticles end 
 I'll verbally burn a nigga, lyrically hurt a nigga 
 Put a voodoo verse on a nigga, Kennedy curse a nigga 
 Who can spit them words quicker than the average man? 
 Who can embarrass a man? Bites you with fangs, and mangle your hands 
 On candid cam, the Canibus can 
 The Canibus can, with the stamina to damage a man 
 (Chorus: Canibus) 
 It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you 
 Without a strong rhyme to step to 
 I told y'all, I roast y'all 
 So come on, hold on 
 It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you 
 Without a strong rhyme to step to 
 I told y'all, I roast y'all 
 So come on, hold on 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, I spit for it, lie for it, live for it, die for it 
 Back out the nine, commit a homicide for it 
 If I'm handcuffed with the right to remain silent for it 
 I'ma blow trial and do the Federal time for it 
 You mad at the last album? I apologize for it 
 Yo, I can't call it, motherfucking Wyclef spoiled it 
 But this time, for '99, I got five on it 
 You should double up and put a dime on it 
 Matter fact, triple your nickel and put $14.99 on it 
 I'ma shine on it, watch Flex drop the bomb on it 
 About ten times on it 
 While people call the request line for it 
 Cipher sounds keep pushing rewind on it 
 Look out for the album with the Canibus design on it 
 Twelve o'clock in the morning, you'll be standing in line for it 
 I'm a live poet, with a sharp ear and eye for it 
 'Cause I tear down mics, and put an out-of-order sign on it 
 (Chorus: Canibus) 
 It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you 
 Without a strong rhyme to step to 
 I told y'all, I roast y'all 
 So come on, hold on 
 It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you 
 Without a strong rhyme to step to 
 I told y'all, I roast y'all 
 So come on, hold on 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, I rip shit, with the ballistic, characteristics 
 Of a hollow-tip at point-blank distance 
 I flip shit, when I spit shit, Father forgive 'Bis 
 I just snatched the Jesus piece off some Christians 
 'Cause they sounded like idiots 
 They went from silver to gold to platinum 
 After the millennium, they'll probably be wearing iridium 
 They so gassed, if a bitch sucked they dick, they'd probably cum helium 
 Y'all niggas can't be serious, I was nice before ice 
 Before Christ, before the words, 'let there be light' 
 And the light, took over the night, I was born with a mic 
 Lord of the mic, before all plant and animal life 
 Took this rap shit to new heights, before the Wright Brothers took flight 
 Before dog fighting and aerial strikes 
 Before emcees picked up pens and started to write 
 Before promotional marketing and poster snipes 
 The Can-I-Bus, will bust up mics, punch out lights 
 Punch out your motherfucking eye-sight 
 For the title-bout fight, ask Ty Phiffe 
 I snatch the track for half-price, the Canibus is too nice 
 Give me that mic 
 (Chorus: Canibus) 
 It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you 
 Without a strong rhyme to step to 
 I told y'all, I roast y'all 
 So come on, hold on 
 It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you 
 Without a strong rhyme to step to 
 I told y'all, I roast y'all 
 So come on, hold on
