(Canibus) 
 Allow me to introduce myself 
 Peace, good to meet ya, the four-legged creature from Giza 
 Taking orders from the spiritual leaders 
 Speechless, save your energy for when you gon' need it 
 'Cause when you see it, you ain't gon' believe it 
 Top five nicest lyricist alive, it ain't no secret 
 Underneath the blue skies over Egypt 
 Genius, crown chakra reaches nine ether 
 But the rhymes are not designed for the non-believer 
 Medical reefer, Cuban cohiba keeper 
 'Follow the Leader', you go green we go greener 
 Take a breather, don't beef with the black behemoth 
 In a wife beater, can't beat 'em on the mic neither 
 Wings mean flight, flight means freedom 
 Freedom from a legion of demons tryna to defeat 'em 
 Such a remarkable speaker, an incredible teacher 
 Every feature, every verse, most his albums are deep, son
