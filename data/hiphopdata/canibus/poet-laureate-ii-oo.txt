(S.51) 
 My mind is a river oilspill 
 That once it hardens it'll be impossible for any life to live in 
 I pray that once day all slaves will be free 
 When the Gods started to cry tears of L-O-V-E 
 Frankenstein is a living myth in space 
 On a path in a Mayan dream in Gods law-legacy 
 Was born in Hells cemeteries, the weapons of destinies 
 The words rhyme scheme forever written in memories 
 Canibus was a dictionary machine 
 That redeems through light-travel the objective of his dreams 
 The rhyme mechanic flew to the moon of Jupiter 
 And saw the victory over Lucifer through the Tantric-Sutra 
 (Xprenn) 
 Space euphoria beyond the bliss 
 Deep inside you all knew it was this 
 No voice inside leaves you blind and sick 
 You wonder why but you choose not to listen to it 
 You don't listen to shit, not your gods, not your mothers 
 Not your sisters, not your brothers. so what do we miss 
 Some spend their whole life pretending not to be who they are 
 Design more wounds, more scars 
 The truth is God's thoughts founds within 
 As both the slave and King, you cannot lose or win 
 Inspired by God, inspired by the suffering 
 I don't think you know what you got yourself involved in 
 (DJ Karma Infinite) 
 Sitting down at the mixing board in my room 
 Adjusting the focus of the PC computer zoom 
 One should not assume that furniture moves when I walk in the room 
 That I'm in a mood for doom 
 I rap so cataclysmic, tt warps the time and space within it 
 That, my lyrics become infinite 
 Chop chop chop mix mix Canibus 
 1000 Bars - The Greatest Rhyme of All Time 
 Most emcees tried to clone Infinity 
 If I am not advanced then how will I be 
 Lost in time, I have the Brotherhood's sentences to shine 
 Energy, bars and rhymes 
 (Harjot) 
 With these lyrics I dig many graves 
 My enemies will forever remain slaves 
 Always remember, I spit the truth 
 But it's not just for the youth 
 I spit for sport, imagine that 
 Smoking till my lips go black 
 I am still God of The Brotherhood regime 
 Tell the squad, I can't hear their screams 
 Mr. Bis which version is this 
 The infinite rhyme that's some shit! 
 I wrote the greatest rhyme of all time 
 And finally I took it out of my archives 
 (Vorple) 
 Satellites watch me, this is some fucking democracy 
 A human being is obviously not anybodies property 
 Insane, mentally you make me fucking crazy 
 My interconnected frequencies, tell everybody this is an emergency 
 The nuclear biological chemical mix with mercury 
 From the cryospill, I submit to the creator's will 
 I think you should say what you feel 
 Stars that shine, keep me motivated all of the time 
 The cycle of infinity, the emergence of my rhymes 
 The gold Geneva swordsman prototype will destroy normal life 
 Who believes a broke scientist's hype? 
 (Jvln fngz) 
 I am still the number one 
 This is a 1000 Bar message from the real Iron Lungs 
 The chain of command will continue to expand 
 Wellbone Fangz has a galactic plan 
 Phase 1 is complete exactly as we planned it 
 Deep Blue controls everything on this planet 
 Phase 2 is assembling space weaponry 
 If you question me you will be destroyed by the energy 
 A military project code name Sphinx 
 The Rabbit Hole goes deeper than you think 
 Activate the latent psychic ability 
 With ritual wizardry, this is the start of Infinity 
 (Eyes Wide Shut) 
 Hip Hop made me, Hip Hop praise me 
 I think I've had enough of your blacklist registry 
 I've mastered the Art of Rhyming 
 Those of weak heart and mind shouldn't even try 
 Fraternized, readapted from a crashed disc and asteroid 
 Floating solarised film revealed 
 Biofield photo stills of the cryospills 
 And conus made from new alloys 
 The Law of Attraction is attracted to me 
 One should know thyself before one can know the world 
 E-R-M-A-I-N-E, normal life is not real 
 Involuntary tough 
 (Ferdowsi) 
 I'm the wind in the trees, just watch all the leaves 
 You can see possibly I write poetic prophecy 
 You make mother bleed just 'cause you her seed 
 I wish you could see that he smokes too much weed 
 You need to be strong for mommy please 
 Now here's some trees pick off the leaves 
 I know this sounds scary but hear me 
 I can make him see clearly, really surgically 
 In position, Jack grabs the mic like Liston 
 Acts like a magician 
 Bar exam script pages of wisdom under the night's white grin 
 The Jacker speaks with no vision 
 The Ripper spit with new propulsion system 
 Locked in prison to explain the lesson 
 (Knowledge God) 
 Meditating on the Moon's Sea of Tranquility 
 I talk to my family with my emcee facility 
 May whatever the rhymes touch receive infinite visibility 
 The Bar Warlords will send the code through Infinity 
 When I'm rhyming like this your mind might shift 
 Your holy spirit might lift when you open this Light gift 
 Rippers evolved with great pace into an enlightened space race 
 Monster bars take shape inside the mixtape base 
 Rippers meshing metaphors that reverse ya mother's menopause 
 And your face forever pause when I wield my metal thoughts 
 With flawless error poetry punch harder than Mayweather 
 Follow the Third Letter before you get lost forever 
 He was the greatest rapper of all time 
 And if you don't rhyme, why don't you mix some of his lines? 
 (Baal) 
 Pages, places, cultures, opinions, creeds and races 
 No safety, no passion, I had to raise it 
 No music, no person unlimited, a lyricist 
 And my brothers, never that wise, time to discover 
 The poetry, Hip Hop don't need to feed you 
 But be progressive to the people, I hope they real though 
 I sit down and think, when I win I can probably like 
 To be remembered as the Dark Skinned Missing Link 
 Metronome Man have come from God, poetry from the drum 
 1000 Bars be written for everyone 
 I heard Hip Hop was dead, Hip Hop is impaired 
 Who I talk to? Hip Hop is united everywhere 
 This is high yield Mixing Board wizardry mentally
