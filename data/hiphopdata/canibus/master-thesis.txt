(Canibus) 
 This is the Master Thesis underneath the deepness 
 Come to MicClub.net where you can read this 
 Run a plot on the map in hyperspace ya 
 From the Society for Scientific Exploration 
 Color is vibration, vibration is sound 
 Sound resonates through the mouth, check it out 
 What I say vibrates no less than nine ways 
 South, South-East, West, South-West 
 East, North, North-East, North-West 
 And the black and white images fade into gray sound waves 
 Trap my adversaries like a mouse in a maze 
 With a bewildering array of lyrical display 
 The best of Bis, orbitally rearranged 
 Monoatomic elements with an adept intelligence 
 The highest professorship, my English etiquette 
 Compels me to not say it if I can't spell it, bitch 
 My circularized third eye sees all 
 Atlantis was surrounded by four sea walls 
 I read one fourth of the Library of Alexandria 
 Before it was burn;ed to the floor 
 I wish I could have learned more 
 About the shapes of the Sacred Geometry they used to draw 
 They were new millennium, but Euclidean in form 
 Ancient in many ways but not nearly as old 
 Carved from Egyptian gold, moulded in Assyria 
 With processed beryllium by the quintillion 
 They cooked on symmetrical stoves 
 With my logo etched above the hole where they inserted the coal 
 And they barbecued birds to the bone 
 And they burned incense in a Buckminster Fuller type dome 
 I talked to Mr Fuller over the phone 
 And he said he had a contract to rebuild Rome 
 He said he didn't want to do it alone 
 I told him I was busy writing poems but I'd think about going 
 The process was slow and the doe was low 
 But I took it as the perfect opportunity to grow 
 Plus I had never traveled that far from home 
 But I had heard about the beauty of Sydonian snow 
 Neon green grass, statues made from translucent glass 
 I'd be crazy to pass 
 I like Alterian Jazz, The Blue Twilight Band 
 That plays tunes from a laser black sax 
 It sounds so laid back, it helps me relax 
 I bought the album after seeing K-PAX 
 Oh, how I miss my nautilus 
 I was told faren goat and mcdotilus did not exist 
 You have a minor case of scaphocephalous 
 I'll prescribe some neo-gothic antibiotics 
 Words concocted from the lyrical locksmith 
 Deadly as ten droplets of Ricin Toxin 
 From every angle the competition gets boxed in 
 As Dr. C indoctrinates his doctrine 
 Translated the English alphabet to the omega text 
 Life is now but death is next 
 Post bond out on bail from the belly of Hell 
 Communicate through diatonic and pentatonic scale 
 These dark side tales might effect sales 
 I set sail and hunt down erect sperm whales 
 Used an aphrodisiac to get a female 
 Called Ginger, tie her up and drink her ginger ale 
 Grand Mariner for me, Scotch on the rocks for you 
 Your vocab is smaller than a cockatoo's 
 In the studio with James Lipton reminiscing 
 About the script that was written before the beginning 
 All of a sudden the boos turn to applause 
 My jaw is stronger than a kenenday Macaws 
 Can't even count the bars I've expended so far 
 Don't want to rap no more, it's been so long 
 I wish the clock would hurry up and tick 
 I'm out in the bush and the sticks humping a hundred klicks 
 Dr. Scholls gave me a good fit 
 Me and him went to school together back in '86 
 When I was really ill, putting flank energy 
 In a rhyme the size of a Tylenol pill 
 You want to laugh now? And cast your belligerent doubt 
 I'll show you what poetry is really about 
 The side effects will make you pass out 
 Followed by skin rash, itching, diarrhea, nausea, and dry mouth 
 You want a time out? You better spit a rhyme out 
 Before the community of real emcees die out 
 College students say to me, "You ain't smart" 
 Record label A&R's say, "This ain't art" 
 These are the contents of the Covenant of the Ark 
 Listen to my chest beat, tell me this ain't heart 
 You've got to be as obsequious as the disciples of Jesus 
 This is my Master Thesis
