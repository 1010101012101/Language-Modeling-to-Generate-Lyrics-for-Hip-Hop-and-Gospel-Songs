(Canibus) 
 Yo, yeah "Die slow" 
 You niggas better "Die slow" 
 All you could do is die slow nigga "Die slow" 
 All you could do is die "Die slow" 
 Fuck y'all "Die slow" 
 "Die slow" "Die slow" "Die slow" 
 (Canibus) 
 You against me? No contest, my tongue hydraulics 
 Strong enough to flip a sixty-four Impala with three adult passengers 
 And a four-hundred pound driver 
 And drown you in less than an ounce of your own saliva 
 Rubber-faced rappers get 
 Stretched like elastic Claymation characters with verbal vernacular 
 Slapping you like a white-water rafter or an Olympic kayaker 
 Paddling across the Niagara 
 My afterburners should be burning you after your body's already been splashed with acid 
 And you turn into ashes 
 Assassins camouflaged in the grass blasting 
 Leaving blood all over your lady like Jackie Onassis 
 I fly your body out of Dallas 
 Perform plastic surgery while we're airborne and switch caskets 
 Then lie to the masses 
 I tell them that you got murdered over some East-West beef between rappers 
 Radio stations'll express they sadness 
 Play classics back to back and pass out 'stop the violence' pamphlets 
 Just imagine, every night your girl's fucking your best-friend 
 While you're in Hell, throwing tantrums 
 I be lamping in a mansion, somewhere out in the Hamptons 
 Giving some pretty-ass bitch a spanking 
 Nigga you can't win, I'm laughing 'cause you a has-been 
 You can't get your groove back, so don't even bother asking Angela Bassett 
 You'll just get your ass kicked, get your head chopped off, and dropped in a basket 
 My left arm's taken but my right one's free 
 That means I can diss another motherfucking emcee 
 With rhymes that appear clearer than liquid crystal 
 My lyrical is more visual than television screen pixels 
 I fire pistols, hit you with miniature missiles 
 Riddle your body with holes, then watch the blood trickle 
 You probably had no idea what you was getting into 
 'Cause on the mic, Can-I-Bus is invincible 
 Fuck you 
 (Break) 
 "Die Slow" through out the convo) 
 Hey Yo that nigga got an attitude 
 Yeah he be acting rude 
 And he's always tryna battle you 
 That last album was terrible 
 When he's on the radio he never got a clean mouth 
 Yeah every time he freestyles, his words be gettin' bleeped out 
 You got the album? 
 Naw I heard it was weak 
 You got the album? 
 I said it was weak 
 But the shit don't come out till next week 
 Hey Yo I like the nigga's beats 
 Yo that shit be coming bugged out 
 Hey Yo that nigga Bis dumbs out 
 He waited too long to come out... 
 (Journalist) 
 To you bitch niggas who talk a lot, but walk the block in halter tops 
 Left side of ya chest, mark the spot 
 That's where a nigga put it, when I'm hooded 
 Then fill you up wit big bullets, prepare you for some channel 6 footage 
 Know what is, me and Bis running through your courtyard 
 Creeping wit a four-five and reaching for your door knob 
 Throw a gun under ya chin, see how quick your whore rise 
 One shot could have a short slide, right out the North side 
 Your whole flow is porkrine, spit the small oints 
 I'm nasty, but my small joints grip the bar point 
 Drop on top of the blue line... right beside the red one 
 Keep the flow fairsome, till the day my career done 
 Bring it to your ass if you the challenging type 
 Especially those surrounding the mic, sounding alike 
 To the Journ, y'all ain't no suitable spitters, true to you niggas 
 Lay you out on MD's, recouping ya liver 
 Shouting my name, ya best to control the noise soldier boy 
 Or homicide will be all over you poys with Polaroids 
 (Convo 2) 
 ("Die Slow" through out the convo) 
 Yeah, yo that nigga Journalist gets busy yo 
 I heard he's from Philly yo 
 I seen him in Bis video 
 He's so skinny though 
 Now he's rolling with Canibus? 
 I don't even understand his shit 
 That nigga sounds like an amaetur 
 Yo I heard Jay manage him 
 Yo he got some heavy gold shit 
 Man, that's some old shit 
 Yeah yo the niggas that he roll with 
 Probably let them hold it

 Everytime, when I see him in the back of The Source
