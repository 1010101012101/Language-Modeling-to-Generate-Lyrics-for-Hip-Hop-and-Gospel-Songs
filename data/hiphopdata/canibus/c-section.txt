This is the C-Section 
 Ripping and repping the lyrical legend 
 Sending y'all to Mic-Club heaven 
 This is the C-Section 
 A lyrical legend 
 Second to none in this profession 
 I spit it exquisite and rip it minute by minute, I'm in it to win it 
 You fuck around with Bis and you're finished 
 Lyrical menace, I'll strip enamel off of your teeth like a dentist 
 With a sentence administered from the Executive Senate 
 Chord progression followed by metaphorical methods 
 Testing, 1-2-3-4, Testing, Testing 
 Supreme supremacist, nemesis to competitors 
 Predators eat intestines of anything they're interested in 
 Slice you like lettuce and celery stalks severed 
 Then make an emcee salad out of suckers and sell it 
 For an expensive percentage with nine-tenths of the credit 
 Drink Red Bull beverage to increase lyrical leverage 
 I only give respect to Mic Club members and my own mentors 
 In the center of my circle where I dare you to enter 
 This is art imitating life imitating art 
 Imitating the brain simulating thoughts when I talk 
 Idealistically I'd spit for free 
 The stenography of the rhyme is what balances me, challenges me 
 EA-6B prowlers, superior air power 
 Fly around us with propulsion that's soundless 
 Spitting rhymes out by the thousands 
 Nitroglycerin tablets under the tongue calm me down a bit 
 Attitude, cynicism and lassitude 
 Battle you? Come on dude, I should slap you fool 
 Spit what? I'll leave your lips numb 
 The friction is so sick, son, your chin will disappear from attrition 
 Rhythmic high intensity conflict is a given 
 Especially if it's Canibus that's doing the ripping 
 The snipping and clipping and the C-Section incisions 
 With scissors with rubber ergonomic grips for the fingers 
 Liars for hire with a defense like Jeffrey Feiger 
 And five polite thugs that work for Mic Club 
 Hyped up, I tear the mic up my man 
 And move forward as expeditiously as I can 
 Ain't nobody in the world like Bis 
 The nicest with radio telescopic devices saying tight shit 
 Facially hairless and gregarious, Jamaican-American 
 Lyricist turned microphone terrorist 
 Airlift me off the front lines to my therapist 
 So I can sit in his chair and tell him how much I care for this 
 This is what they want, this is what they love 
 To engage in the exchange of ideas and drugs 
 While I'm in the cut satellite-tracking you rappers 
 With months of food rations beneath the Catacombs of Paris 
 Theories of super lattice is super savage 
 Atomic attack tachometers flash when I punch the gas, Bitch 
 The farther I climb the harder I rhyme 
 You've got to face death and survive to feel more alive 
 The quality of life is an illusion of the mind 
 Superimposed lines look two-dimensional from the side 
 According to the size of the C-Section applied 
 If they say I'm the best after I've died, don't be surprised 
 I'll C-Section the sky and let my energy rise 
 At the moment of truth I'll know it's definitely my time 
 As my soul is squeezed through the sieve 
 I'll be grateful because I lived, the only drawback is I didn't have kids 
 To C-Section my beautiful wiz 
 And see the resemblance of my face in hers or his 
 Who knows what the future will bring 
 It stresses me to think, this mic meant everything know it doesn't seem important 
 Now I've got to follow orders 
 Defend borders from Maine to California and Seattle to Florida 
 If I could talk to the Oracle I know what I'd ask her 
 I'd speak to her about my passions 
 As the hour glasses turn and my life passes 
 I'll just wait until I see the Master and I'll just ask Him 
 Forget it, that's the future and this is the present 
 A message to anyone listening to the C-Section
