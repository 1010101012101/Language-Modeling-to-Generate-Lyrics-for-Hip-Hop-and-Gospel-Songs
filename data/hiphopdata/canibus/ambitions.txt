(Canibus) 
 Listen to Ambition, no Can-I-Kick it 
 No time for can kicking when the Canibus spit it 
 It's the bona-fide soldier, my fuel-mix rich like Oprah 
 She hate Hip Hop, so what 
 Governor Bredesen came to visit the regiment 
 Two weeks after the President to give us some medicine 
 A black bucket of paint blacked-out much of my face 
 Blacked-out what I wanted to say 
 Write a rhyme every other day, coffee keep me up and awake 
 I bust rhymes 'cause I want to be great 
 Before it's too fake and too late, before destiny meets fate 
 I hear ghost signals in the mixtape 
 Never stereotype or it'll be a sound burial tonight 
 If I catch you on a karaoke mic 
 Clipping my whiskers, handling my goatee business 
 Call upon your witness, Grits and Canibus spit 
 Encrypted Canibus codes, flows tabulated below 
 Amidst spits and notes Germaine wrote 
 Pardon a poor pauper with nothing to offer from his coffin 
 Coughing up a mouthful of volcanic sulfur 
 Walking towards the altar 
 Hand-in-hand with my father-in-law's daughters, my high-value target 
 Force get pitchforked out of orbit 
 Pause it; rewind what I recorded, see if the eye caught it 
 Five o'clock in the morning, cup of joe boiling 
 Who's pouring? Bona-fide lyrics; who's calling?
