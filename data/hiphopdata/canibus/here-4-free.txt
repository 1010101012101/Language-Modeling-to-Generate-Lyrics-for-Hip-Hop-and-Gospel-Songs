 Girl! Look over there... is that Canibus? 
 (Female #2) 
 I Don't Know 
 (Female #1) 
 It looks like him 
 (Female #2) 
 I think it is 
 (Bouncer) 
 Is your name on the list? 
 Who you here to see? 
 (Canibus) 
 I don't think I'm on the list 
 I'm just here for Free 
 (Bouncer) 
 You got a video out? 
 You got a platinum LP? 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo why does that matter? 
 I just came for Free 
 (Bouncer) 
 All right Bis 
 Let him through 
 (Female #1) 
 Where's he been? 
 (Canibus) 
 Damn girl, look at you now, huh 
 On TV with that pretty smile, huh 
 Truth is, I miss you and I want to tell you 
 But I ain't got no numbers, e-mail, or nothing 
 You know I seen you at the Bad Boy for Life shoot 
 You was wearing the tight-blue night-suit 
 I remember when I connected eyes with you 
 You winked at me, I thought that was really nice of you 
 I remember once staying up all night with you 
 Writing with you, talking about life with you, it was exciting too 
 I'm assuming you did the same because you cared 
 Girl, don't you remember all the laughter we shared? 
 We used to talk about why Praz failed so bad 
 And why the hell Wyclef's breath smelled so bad 
 O.K., I know I don't need to tell them all that 
 But we was kind of feeling each other, you can't deny that 
 We worked on records together, you murdered them tracks 
 I think it was sexy how you said them verses like that 
 You said, 'Free be the one rocking shit, special operative 
 Specialize in weapon diagnostics 
 Just thinking about it got me supped up 
 I want to hug you in your birthday suit, what? 
 Damn, this record is getting out of hand 
 I'm crazy; you probably, already got a man 
 In that case, I hope you hear this song 
 Sincerely yours, see you in One Oh Six and Park
