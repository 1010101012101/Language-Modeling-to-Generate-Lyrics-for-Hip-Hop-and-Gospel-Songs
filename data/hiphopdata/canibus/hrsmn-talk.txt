You don't have a broad enough bandwidth to understand Bis 
 Like what if - I changed my name to CAN-I-RIP 
 Tell me, would you understand it? 
 Or does it trouble you? 
 Is it too much over your head, does it puzzle you? 
 I can rap about whateva the fuck I want 
 What's wrong with rappin' about whateva the fuck I'd done 
 Visually and verbally, I'm hi-res cutting edge 
 And if you know Rakim then you should "Know the Ledge" 
 I know I do, Get everything I've ever rhymed to 
 Staple it together and you got a fuckin' bible 
 Let me remind you, Records like "Beasts from the East" 
 Proove that I crucify you 
 If I ever get to rap behind you. 
 What about the freestyles I put on vinyl 
 For DJs and hiphop heads to get hype to 
 Besides who raps like I do? 
 If you ever heard I'm not the best you being lied to 
 Here's a FYI to I can rip 
 But you don't have the mental bandwidth to understand Bis 
 Niggaz wanna talk the talk, 
 But when they get their feet chopped off 
 They can't walk the walk
