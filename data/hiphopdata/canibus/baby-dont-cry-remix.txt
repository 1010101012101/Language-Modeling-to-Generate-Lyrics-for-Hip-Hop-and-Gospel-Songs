First of all, stop crying cause you ain't my baby 
 Second of all, stop lying cause you ain't my lady 
 You straight betrayed me, 
 It was like something out of a Martin Scorsese Script on page three, it was crazy 
 If it wasn't for the AV camera installed in the AC 
 I wouldn't know you roll your eyes at me when you embrace me 
 You want me to stop cursing? Then stop watching "Berman and Berman" 
 And stop talking about me in the third person 
 Can't you see that I'm working? The crying makes me nervous 
 That interferes with my verses, you doing it on purpose 
 You told me that you love me when you hate me 
 Even if you had the same DNA, you couldn't relate to me 
 There's only one way to wait for me and that's patiently 
 I pay all the bills bitch, watch what you say to me 
 You wanna leave? Leave, you ain't important! 
 Go find Mr. Right, I hope you catch AIDS searching for him
