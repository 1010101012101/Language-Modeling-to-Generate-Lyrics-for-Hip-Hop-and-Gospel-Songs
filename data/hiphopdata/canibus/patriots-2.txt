(Canibus) 
 Espionage light fog with night goggs, 
 On an Oil Rig Barge with 10 frogs and the Sarge playing cards, 
 Just another day on the job, 
 We draw straws to determine point guard, they got stripes we got stars 
 Legendary spit 1776, 
 It's no option for the enemy to quit, 
 Every hit is uplinked to a memory chip, 
 Every 1 minute, 10 seconds -- 70 ticks, 
 Welcome to the top of the earth, ya compass don't work, 
 I'm telling you where we are but you still not certain, 
 A verse colder than killer cobras over Jehova, 
 Delta soldiers in camouflage coloured Kubotas, 
 Freefall off the snow cliff before the pole shift, 
 Delay pulling your rip cord long to get the closest, 
 Master of the azimuth, Codename: Captain Classic, 
 Transmit back to Sergeant Radcliffe, 
 Soldier Stone came up with an excellent tactic, 
 Here's a FBCB2, now YOU practice, 
 Astro-like plastic, blast squad automatics, 
 Nobody can match it, I demolition rappers 
 I know you elite, I know what you doing, 
 I know who you are, you know where I'm going, 
 The Ripper paints the picture, lyrically drawn it 
 In Cartesian coordinates, I'm already bored of it 
 Gimme a sec, pause the shit, 
 Take a breath from your water board torture on the top of the monolith, 
 Divine lineage lines, split from divine, 
 Neuropeptides get high off millennium wine, 
 Female gender search, predator lurks in a black hearse, 
 Through the desert dirt to the end of the Earth, 
 Climb aboard the vessel of an unknown metal, 
 Controlled by offroad rebels working for the Devil, 
 I'm a patriot, I say it like I mean it, 
 Said the whole rhyme using circular breathing, 
 Are you a patriot? Say it like you mean, 
 Tell them how you train even when you on leave 
 (D One) 
 Yo bis I train between spotlights and where the toes tip 
 Through the pain / see my one and only blow me a kiss 
 I'm the young vet hungry for next peep the pressure build 
 In memory of old burial hill 
 Flyness dressed to kill / bitch never misjudge 
 What the kid gut under his belt 
 City slicka' / rip the jackers allegiance is born 
 The more you sweat in practice the less you bleed in war 
 Upper body cut / always on the run 
 Feet are soar / read more 
 Better myself / teach 'em all 
 Freedom fighter / paranoid of tabloids 
 Midnight rider 
 W/ the five o'clock shadow / bad boy 
 Clothes black / avoid close ties stay on the move 
 Legendary the name the face / like dejavu 
 Modern benjamin martin marksmen / we elite 
 You a weed in a gentlemen's garden 
 Luck a' the Irish is mixin' w/ Mexican boxin' 
 Hate on a patriot / we get offended in boston 
 Renegade I been in trainin' since ninety-eight 
 And I'm ready waitin' got 'em behind the eight-ball / it's over 
 That's all soldier / said it like I meant it 
 The heart of history give me liberty or a death wish
