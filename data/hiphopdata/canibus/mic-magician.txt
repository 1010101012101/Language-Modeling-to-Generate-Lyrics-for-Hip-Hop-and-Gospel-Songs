Just like that, I pulled a rabbit out of a hat 
 'Cause you wanted to see a magical rap 
 I got Asperger's syndrome, I write, produce and spit poems 
 Combination's of other moves can lift the soul 
 The vibratory frequency completely related to human decency 
 Life is what you believe it to be 
 So don't agree to disagree, you ain't no real emcee 
 Youtube: Canibus 'Doin' it Live' in HD 
 Ligaments, muscles, tendons; strengthens, lengthens 
 The shelf life of my human body is extendin' 
 The vortex is vile, so is my style extremophile 
 I don't freestyle for keyboard crowds 
 'Cause they knowledge is widespread but they mind is dead 
 The masses will never understand the rhymes I said 
 They say your only option is a FEMA camp 
 Closed coffin, I say your only option is to stop 'em 
 Get over your feelings of false security 
 Before you bleed burgundy 
 Repent before the Goddess of Purity 
 She says she knows somebody that can work with me 
 And sent Cultureshock down to Earth for me 
 To spit a verse for me
