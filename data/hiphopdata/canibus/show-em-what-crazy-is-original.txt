(Canibus) 
 Come sit with me, I show you how I consistently 
 Manifest multiplicity, lyrically if you can do the same let me see 
 If you can then you are not my enemy 
 And if can not then I must make you a better emcee 
 Lets turn to page three we'll start there 
 The contract says you gotta have a thousand bars to spare 
 You think this type of Hip Hop is one dimensional but it's not 
 You don't understand what I gave you, you don't understand what you got 
 I know you well though 
 You think you can out rap me HELL NO 
 Unknown till I step to the microphone 
 Canibus turn this shit into a crisis zone 
 Automatically the sharpest at it, this just practice 
 Canibus/Keith Murray, I'm a shark he the savage 
 Satellite rappers delight we battle for the mic 
 In a condo bench pressing bags of brown rice 
 The modern day 'Hip Hop Hooray' 
 From Jacque Demolay spitting lyrics on top of the 808 
 They used to call me a mental case 
 But one day men will say he immigrated beyond Heaven's gate 
 My net worth is my next verse 
 In a race to a billion bars what if you could get there first 
 He had guns attached his guns where black 
 Stuck heads to thumb tacks placed on a wall sized map 
 This is not sorcery this is just a lyrical part of me 
 My artistry please pardon me 
 So I can watch satellites comb over the Earth 
 I count thousands they probably just stole my verse 
 From the Flora to the Fauna, slaughtered in absence of water 
 Bis and Murray this is Undergod horror 
 Undergod horror, Show Em What Crazy Is 
 Undergod horror, Show Em What Crazy Is 
 Undergod horror, Show Em What Crazy Is 
 Undergod horror, Show Em What Crazy Is 
 It's a hard job but somebody got do it 
 It's a hard job but somebody got do it 
 (Keith Murray) 
 Come sit with me Canibus and Keith Murray 
 Ain't shit been this sick since the legalization of Christianity 
 Mentally I explore universally there's no boxing me in 
 I rock with Martin Luther-bility 
 Me and Bis might be 
 The two sickest scientist emcees probing the galaxy 
 I know why you don't like me, I get love from your wifey 
 I get dumb like E-40 might change my style hyphy 
 Come dance with the stars and get bullet scars 
 Fuck At&t we got more bars 
 Your attempts of deception can't deter our direction 
 I demise your inner-chi like the state of perfection 
 There's always something better so we keep perplexing 
 With an exclamation point like texting with aggression 
 Our manuscripts are sicker than Saddam 
 We'll use his own blood to rewrite the Koran 
 Canibus is right I'm a savage in the pursuit of Hip Hop happiness 
 Killing the wackness 
 So I enlist one of the grittiest emcees on the Planet Earth 
 To help me with this shit 
 It's a hard job but somebody gotta do it 
 Your style is like the airport we run right through it 
 (Canibus) 
 UnderGodz will come in tomorrow 
 Style bizero bizarre bizarro 
 Slipknot moshpit Hip Hop 
 On your knees with your hands behind your back and your fingers interlocked gwop 
 Canibus capsule come sit with me on my camel 
 War of the Worlds, who wanna battle? 
 (Keith Murray) 
 We spank niggas and they go tattle 
 Intense like when Eminem and Canibus had a battle 
 Omnipresent omnipotent insurmountable 
 Malicious discrepancy of ridiculousness 
 I roll with the animals like a zoologist 
 Get facetious then make you pray like a mantis 
 Your dogs be the mangiest rabiest 
 Send them to the vets we'll put 'em to sleep, show 'em what crazy is 
 Undergod Horror, Show 'em what crazy is 
 Undergod Horror, Show 'em what crazy is 
 Undergod Horror, Show 'em what crazy is 
 Show 'em what crazy is, show 'em what crazy is 
 It's a Hard Job but somebody got do it 
 Bis and Murray we run right through it 
 It's a Hard Job but somebody got do it 
 Bis and Murray we run right through it 
 (Canibus) 
 Eyes low so I still won't rhyme slow 
 You know I wanna flow when you see my eyes glow 
 Analyse the words vaporize into smoke like herb 
 As ridiculous as a dinosaur bird 
 You are absurd, cut your guts open you turd 
 Undergods Canibus Keith Murray you heard
