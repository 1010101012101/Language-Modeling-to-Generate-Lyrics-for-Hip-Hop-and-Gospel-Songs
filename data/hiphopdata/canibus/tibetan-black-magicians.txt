 Jedi Mind Tricks 
 Canibus 
 Yo 
 I grab mics, bust the raw, take flight, adjust to yaw 
 I break your bicuspid with your own jaw 
 Metaphors started menopause in your moms, before you were born 
 Technically, you don't even exist, God 
 A flick of the wrist and you're gone 
 Lost in limbo like pink shit camouflaged in a pig farm 
 I'm an enigma, I rip bars 
 I'll burn your star with five points, plus the mic I've ripped thus far 
 I'll start from your forehead 
 Peel the top of your fucking face off like an orange, then eat the carnage 
 My God that sounds horrid 
 Eating emcees is like eating garbage; they make me vomit 
 Discombobulate prostates, rehydrate dry lakes 
 Wipe the ammonium nitrate across the side of your face 
 Anthropomorphologically speaking, I'm out of your league 
 Who can match the bottom of my top speed? 
 Scourging the Earth, verses immersed in the dirt 
 Heart monitors flat-line due to therapy error 
 Sentences go through re-synthesis 
 I leave them looking Bleaker than Memphis is, without Roc-A-Fella membership 
 Don't be an optimist, and try to rock with Bis 
 You'll end up in an iced-out sarcophagus 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 Every rapper better fear me, 'cause Vinnie Paz is a beast 
 And y'all steady screaming for war but want peace 
 You trying ta walk through the fog where sun leaks 
 Ya trying to walk two dogs with one leash 
 You can't overstand the mathematics 
 How rip bars, walk through walls perform magic 
 Tibetan Black Magic, I'm a warlord 
 I'll stab you through your fucking temple with a floorboard 
 I'm a born lord, I was baptized 
 To see the universal through a cats eyes 
 Here come the black skies, it's all darkness 
 I breathe life into Jesus Christ's carcass!

 (Canibus) 
 Once I duct tape you to the front of a Mack truck's fascia 
 Drive through a brick wall, pull the parking brake up 
 Ask you for your proof of registration, say what? 
 I can't understand a word you're saying, you fuck 
 Peel you off till you drop on the floor 
 Drag you to the manifold, make you put your mouth around the exhaust 
 Squeeze your neck harder when you start to cough 
 I bet you never thought this could happen just for pissing me off 
 I'm in for hardcore Hip Hop, the surrogate father 
 Protecting rap, like the exoskeleton of a lobster 
 I'll moonwalk on water, harpoon jackers 
 And drag them back to the harbour for the local photographers 
 Top four point fingers and watch through binoculars 
 Look what Harry Potter did to Andrew Galotta, kid 
 Where the enemies exchange negative energy 
 But you can't forgive and forget with an elephant memory 
 'Cause you know who, snatched the mic from you know who 
 But let's keep that between me and you 
 Me and JMT, rippers that'll rip your ass 
 I've got an empty mag, get them Vinnie Paz 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 I get a bloodlust when I see a slug bust 
 Hit your mug with a .38 snub and watch the blood rush 
 Nothing above us, y'all better back off 
 'Cause you a devil like the Canaanite in Sackcloth 
 We busting Gats off, it's a clean kill 
 It doesn't seem real when your spleen spill 
 So listen to what I'm spitting at y'all 
 La illaha, il Allah il Allah 
 Come on y'all your getting hit in the chest 
 'Cause Vinnie Pazienz and Canibus is the best 
 Ripping the rest and all y'all seek is ashes 
 I love reading Koran in pitch blackness 
 I love reading the psalms to bitch actors 
 I love reading the palms of bitch rappers!
