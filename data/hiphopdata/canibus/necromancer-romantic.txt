I'm a new-age nation creation, 
 A guilty smiling inspiration for every living derivative of human nature 
 Human or animal, alien, formal or casual; true story hallucinatory or magical 
 Battle-you attitude, improving microphone-altitudes 
 Tools I use to take it to back to school 
 True beluga whale brain cells, blue-man supercomputer Homosapien male 
 Crazy as hell! 
 Powered by Intel, for real 
 I save struggled rap by the bell 
 I wrote it's name on a cartridge with a thousand shells 
 On a cold mountain slope, dual eyepiece for a scope 
 "Don't miss". "Muthafucka', I won't!" 
 The eye o' the sniper 
 Transfix, zoom in tighter 
 The hammer click, feel the hype of the viper bitin' the mystery writer 
 Black iris, rap Osiris grip the mic till I get arthritis 
 Javelin-tooth tiger with bronchitis 
 Gold bars from King Midas come in all sizes 
 Prince Pyro's saliva could start forest fires 
 The borders are private when ten thousand bars are united 
 I'm 'bout to show you a quarter and get you all excited 
 Hip-Hop is my bitch, so don't even try it 
 Don't deny it, Canibus with Guilty Smiles wildin 
 Pig Latin assassin, born in a dirty log cabin 
 We live off acid, termites, and aspirin 
 Rolling up that zigzag, mad niggaz is laughin', we old school but what we spitting is classic 
 Paper or plastic? Necromancer Romantic 
 Roaming frantic, Cracker Barrel apparel with a fat ass bitch 
 Cooking hash browns and grits 
 Fuck around with Rip? I'll hunt you down with bloodhounds and ticks 
 With Lyme disease, flies and fleas, you can't see, collide with trees 
 My Marines piss on emcees 
 Pine-Sol colored, thought the crime was solved but it wasn't 
 Got sawed in half by a psychopath SAW gunner 
 Rusty ass metal melt rubber, motherfuckin' food for the buzzards 
 Dirty Harry's my brother and I'm his ugly cousin 
 Whistling Dixie, get up there and grip that fifty 
 My breath stink, my mustache smell fishy 
 Tell Nikki that her pussy is squishy, she gettin' money she pretty 
 I'm still livin' like a bum in the city 
 Scarecrow skinny but still get busy 
 Look me up on Wiki 
 If ripping beats is a crime I'm guilty 
 You put a quarter in my cup? It's a rizzy 
 Y'all niggaz know what it is, fuck with me! 
 Guilty Smiles, Rip the Jacker, don't need no more back up 
 When we on the track you gettin' wrapped up 
 Dynamite alloys, salty ass soy sauce cowboys 
 What the fuck you gonna do now boy?! 
 Foul Ball, Guilty Smiles, clear it out y'all 
 Around here we the lyrical law
