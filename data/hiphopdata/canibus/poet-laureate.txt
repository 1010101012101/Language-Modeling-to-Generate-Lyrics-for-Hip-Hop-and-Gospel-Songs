Yo, Houston to Earth, watch the Ripper crucify you with verse 
 My urethra to your uvula quenches your thirst 
 Put your flames out with dry desert dirt where leopards lurk 
 Lock your soul down with an esoteric weapons search 
 Strap a bomb to one of your label's record clerks 
 And activate it as soon as they get to work 
 Ring the alarm, red alert nigga it gets worse 
 Bypass security networks with select words 
 Megahertz make nebulas reverse 'til your head bursts 
 Call the press first and ask them who has the best verse 
 Give me the respect I deserve 
 If you are what you eat, it's obvious I can't eat what I'm worth 
 Y'all niggas eat pussy and burp 
 The other half of y'all suck dick 'til your jaws and your neck hurt 
 When you address me nigga, end your sentence with 'Sir' 
 Critics went berserk, they haven't even heard my best work 
 See I broke into their mind by 
 Quietly going by their eardrum walls and hot-wired their skulls 
 Yeah, I earned the name Canibus but what did it cost? 
 Battle rap is nothing but a serendipitous whore 
 Niggas probably like, "What the fuck he dissing him for?" 
 Yeah, he dissed me first, but you were never informed 
 I'm one of the top five nigga, my shit is tight nigga 
 You heard it right nigga, I rock mics nigga 
 But the limelight isn't where I belong 
 The top four don't even look in the mirror no more 
 If they did, I'd be in the mirror looking back at them 
 Ready to grab them, kidnap them and put them on my album 
 I rip jackers, rip the time-space fabric 
 Loop the future with the past tense, looking for patterns 
 Eradicate Africans that sold Africans to Saxons 
 And forced black men to pay taxes 
 Attack a wack bitch with counter-tactics 
 Split your bullet proof chassis in half with a rapid Gatling 
 Keep firing at you 'til you're trapped in 
 Non-combatants scramble for helicopter extraction 
 While I'm back at Fort Bragg, bragging 
 How I tortured them faggots and stabbed them with Rip the Jacker daggers 
 Slay dragons with old passages from black magic manuscripts 
 I found in the cabinet written in Arabic 
 Translate the characters one by one like Arafat's tarot card suggests 
 I make terrorist's threats through your stereo set 
 Various anthrax carriers sending sarin to the press 
 With an imaginary address, Cani's the best 
 Untraceable, your picture's unpaintable canvas is wet 
 Let me dry you off with some of this fire I spit 
 Twenty six years old, nigga look how I spit 
 Microphone fiend, since I was like fourteen 
 My Cuban uncle used to sell cocaine, Okay? 
 I'm reloaded, you're fucking with the wrong MC 
 Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to the whole industry 
 Potent as Hennessey that was distilled in Tennessee 
 One shot scrambles your memory indefinitely 
 Nowadays a hundred bars ain't impressive to me 
 You stepping to me, nigga do it intelligently 
 You want to battle? Or do you want to fucking wrestle with me 
 You ain't better than me, you just have an obsession with me 
 Canibus hybrid, the cake icing of rhyming 
 As I grow old I get colder like the declining climate 
 On Earth's environment, entirely tireless 
 Rhymes come from a higherness of wireless dialect 
 Scientists from Sirius B designed my specs 
 Astrally project during heightened sex 
 Chakras connect, doctors inspect what they can't possibly interpret yet 
 That's why they revert to threats 
 They curse and throw fits 
 They're like immature Earth cadets looking like Captain Kirk in a dress 
 Lyrically I'll step on you, Rip on you 
 Then I'll defecate what I just digested on you 
 I'm better than you, I'm better than you, I'm better than you 
 Just to get the checkered flag I'll put the pressure on you 
 Put the extra effort on you 
 Write a motherfucking letter to you and your editors too, threatening you 
 Detectives check your mail and your Messenger too 
 You can take this verbal slashing that I left as a clue 
 Execute the type of wickedness the Devil approves 
 Which basically means I can do whatever with you 
 I'm a rap music mutant with a cool name 
 Misconstrued fame but I spit butane 
 Blue flames out of giant CO2 tanks 
 Demagnetized memory banks, enhanced, advanced 
 One of a kind, like modern man's retina scans 
 Quick as a glance and flickers from kerosene lamps 
 What do you want me to break first? Your jaw or your grill 
 What type of spit do you want from me? Sparkling or still 
 Studied law at Yale, draw up my own deals 
 So the longer they resist me the stronger I feel 
 Spread your ganglia from Tanzania to Flats of East Anglia 
 Give up, you can't keep up 
 The man eater in a wife beater spreading typhoid fever 
 Through mic receivers with light reverb 
 Type in the right keywords, I might emerge 
 It takes a really nice nigga to excite these nerds 
 Niggas want to see the gully in me, keep fucking with me 
 Never under pressure, I keep the pressure under me 
 Burn the weed, drop a freestyle on the Internet 
 Then watch niggas burn the CD 
 Upload a picture of your mom getting DP'd 
 I'm one size away from thirteen, believe it she peed 
 I'm the illest and it's going to be that way forever 
 Word of mouth is good, but a mouth with words is better 
 Nigga, nobody gets sicker than the Ripper
