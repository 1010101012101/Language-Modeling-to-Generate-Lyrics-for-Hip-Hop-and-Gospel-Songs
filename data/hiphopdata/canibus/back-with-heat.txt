 Yeah 
 The, the, the, the the rhyme weapon legend 
 That's what my nigga's yelling, that's what they yelling 
 The, the, the, the the rhyme weapon legend 
 Yeah, niggas just don't know 
 That's what my nigga's yelling 
 But I'ma let 'em know 
 Let 'em know 'Bis, how to flow, how to 
 How to go, how to, how to 
 (Canibus) 
 If I coughed in my fist when I opened my hand 
 There'd be dope in my hand 'cause I spoke in my hand 
 In the gym till I turned a two-pack to a four 
 Till the four got sore and had to make two more 
 In a whole other state of mind 
 Mexican standoffs waste lives but they save time 
 You know the danger of the Ranger, pantyhose over cabeza 
 Scopes and lasers, my toaster is a widow-maker 
 "Good things comes to those that wait" 
 Bullshit, better things come to those that chase 
 I sweep the streets with a fleet bigger than the Greeks 
 Till we occupy your land like thieves 
 We fitting to eat, nigga 
 (Canibus) 
 I'm back for the music, back to do exclusives 
 Back to change the view of Hip Hop from that bullshit 
 Back to mash up beats that bang up your Ave and streets 
 Canibus, nigga, Back with heat 
 (Canibus) 
 Hideout the box with Nottz, shots just went off 
 Nigga better check to see if you caught 
 Shootouts between rap stars driving fast cars 
 Through the hills of Madagascar, we can take it that far 
 Screw-face you niggas 
 Yo, who's the real rude bwoy, rude nigga? Not you nigga, you got booed nigga 
 My close quarter combat, not bad 
 Big niggas drop dead when I stop their air 
 You're just a man, you're relationship with oxygen's clear 
 Canibus rocking with Nottz this year 
 Yeah, mother fuckers, your back-blast area clear 
 Canibus rocking with Nottz this year 
 Yeah 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, ayo 
 A slug to the stomach make a thug move sluggish 
 Crawling in his bloodiness no matter how big the gun is 
 If the fuzz is coming, blast shells by the tonnage 
 Till there ain't nothing left and start running (Run!) 
 I got a message bout I got a court summons 
 Everybody around me want something, they all extort nothing 
 I was young, I was stupid, I was really too hyped 
 'Cause I thought a microphone was really worth my life 
 Go make a club banger, that's what they ask me to do 
 You a dumb nigga, who the fuck is asking you? 
 I'll write a book for you, Nottz'll write a hook for you 
 We can both split half of what we took from you 
 I'm just a round-the-way neighbour in your hood 'fella 
 You want to show love? Let's break bud nigga 
 We control the price of rap-fuel 
 I attacked you because annual tax was due 
 Four dollars a gallon, we're going to take it back to two 
 Hip Hop nigga, that's what we back to do 
 For you, for you, for you, that's what we back to do 
 For you, for you, for you, that's what we back to do 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo I front for the flicks, I stunt for the chicks 
 Make them want for the dick, I wasn't a thug from the get 
 But I run with the vets on the streets 
 Were they hunt for the bit, many thirsty niggas hunger for the necks 
 (Canibus) 
 The, the, the, the 
 The rhyme weapon legend 
 That's what my nigga's yelling
