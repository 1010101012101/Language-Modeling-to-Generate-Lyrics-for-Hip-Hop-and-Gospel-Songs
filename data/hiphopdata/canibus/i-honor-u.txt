(Chorus 1: MB) 
 We'll never part (through) sickness and health (health) 
 You are my heart -- I love you more than I love myself 
 (Yeahayyeah) But in the middle of the night 
 I heard you crying in your sleep but it'll be all right 
 I'll be there for you (just for you) 
 If you tell me all your secrets 
 Yet in the middle of the night 
 I heard you crying in your sleep I held you tight 
 I'll be there for you (youuooooh) 
 If you tell me all your secrets 
 (Canibus) 
 Boy meets girl, boy really likes her 
 Boy loses contact with girl, but he finds her 
 Girl has no clue that boy is a liar and he has no honour 
 So she dates him regardless, 'cause she thought he was harmless 
 And he had her believing he was the man she wanted 
 To spend the rest of her life with, the words, 'I love you' 
 Were priceless, unpredictable like rolling dices 
 Nonetheless, in spite of the frightening repercussions, 
 You might get, people still risk they necks 
 Of course it's nice, the feeling of courtship, roses and stuff 
 Women never get it often enough 
 And the reason people love they mother so much 
 Besides the fact she carried you for nine months, is trust 
 It's a five letter word, that should only occur 
 Between him and her, before the bees and the birds (word) 
 (Canibus) 
 I heard a soft moan in the middle of March 
 Then I felt a powerful force push me forward like a dart 
 On your mark, get set, go, I was off 
 Flagella was my propeller, wiggling back and forth 
 Then I set a course for the border 
 Mother Nature's karma calling me to the rock of Gibraltar 
 The competition tried to be smart, but I was smarter 
 My competitors were swimming fast, so I swam harder 
 Submerged in water, praying to my heavenly father 
 If I don't make it through I'm a goner 
 Screaming out, "Death before dishonour," 
 Because I'm awesomely stronger, my stamina last longer 
 I was destined to be a son instead of a daughter 
 X, Y is the male chromosomal order 
 One will stay alive and survive, the rest will 
 (Chorus 2: MB) 
 In the middle of the night 
 I heard you crying in your sleep I held you tight 
 I'll be there for you... 
 If you tell me all your secrets 
 (Canibus) 
 Mommy I'm up in your stomach, bugging, whenever you rub it, 
 I love it, like a comforters covers, you warm as an oven 
 Your husband, stubborn, how can you love him? 
 Smoking cigarettes by the dozen, when he knows that I'm coming 
 Bad move, you hoping that Daddy improves 
 Knowing in your heart that's bull, because he's too cruel 
 You've been abused, used, you've got, wounds and scars 
 Think with your mind, not with your heart, let's go to Grandma's 
 Terminate the lease, call the landlord 
 Give your job two weeks notice, pack up the car, and go to New York 
 What part? They got a little borough called the Bronx, Mom 
 And I heard that's where Hip Hop is gonna start 
 Hell yeah, I think we need to be right there 
 Four months in your stomach, and I already chose a career 
 When you cry, I hear, and I wish I could dry your tears 
 But I can't 'cause I'm stuck in here 
 Five months from being able to lay against your chest 
 I can't even hold you in my arms, 'cause they ain't developed yet 
 But I swear to you, as to God's almighty truth 
 I'ma be there for you, I'ma be there for you 
 (Chorus 1 w/ variations) 
 Tell me!
