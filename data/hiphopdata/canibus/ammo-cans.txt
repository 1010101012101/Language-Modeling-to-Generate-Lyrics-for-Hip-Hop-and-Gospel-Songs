(Chorus: Canibus) 
 I am the Metronome Man, ten grand in the ammo can 
 That's my fammo fam, Bitter Breed Canibus Man 
 Ten grand in the ammo can, that's my fammo fam 
 It's Bitter Breed and the Canibus Man 
 (Canibus) 
 Remote control microphone melatone Canibus clone 
 NY pheromones interact with my poems 
 Attack those who are not alone like hollow bones 
 We gon' climb to the top if the sky don't close 
 I spike radiation readings just by bleeding 
 If I bite whatever I'm eating when I'm night feeding 
 Mountain hunt rock cut, food provisions is stocked up 
 Get that toxic spill mopped up 
 Don't mess up when you verse your rhyme or you will be circumcised 
 Then your foreskin will look worse than mine 
 Invasion contraputation 
 Metaphors explore spaceships on the day ship from stingray cliff 
 It's the evolution of the human animal vocalisation system 
 Canibus wordsmith spitting 
 Rap automatic, lyrics systematic synaptic analysis to telepathic gymnastics 
 Hand to hand, close quarters, four corners, no floor 
 My arms ten foot long koala bear claws 
 R-A-W raw, my head can barely fit on 
 Canibus got a muscular skull 
 Psychic spooks listen to your mind in the mic booth 
 If you can't calm down you being chased by white tooth 
 Hot rum, gold tongues, cold lungs 
 The arctic ones, bright orange midnight Sun
