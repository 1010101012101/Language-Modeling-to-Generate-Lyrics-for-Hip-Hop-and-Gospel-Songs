(Canibus) 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo, 
 I look directly into human eyes to see if you pussy 
 And completely ruin your ability to lie to me 
 Now you can stand in front of me looking real silly 
 Or prepare to go to battle and kick a rhyme to me 
 I pull a nine on a bully, cock back the cannon 
 God damn it, I don't think you fully understand it 
 Ask nine out of ten people on the planet 
 Who the best is, the question will go unanswered 
 Till I step up, to the frontline with rhymes 
 Revving my engines like they was powered by Le Man's 
 Murdering niggas with lyrics manufactured within my DNA's double-helix 
 I'll leave you in troubled spirits 
 I'm absolutely the purest from the USA to Europe 
 'Cause I deserve it 
 Let me pass it to my man Wyclef 
 W-y-c-l-e-f, yo, there is no contest 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo, 
 My lyrical inertia rips holes through the fabric of universes 
 With rhymes three times the density of what the earth is 
 I carry lyrics for niggas who carry burners 
 You against me is like a lighter against a furnace 
 Knocking niggas out and knocking niggas off 
 For coming around the way with them Lugz that look like clogs 
 Check the astrophysics of these lyrical lyrics 
 Come in a digit too big for niggas to count on their fingers 
 Check the hype-shit, blow up a mic, shit 
 You might get beat the fuck up in broad daylight with a nightstick 
 Mentally advanced ever since the brain transplant 
 Canibus received the Fugee jacket from Techsan 
 See physically I move at a velocity 
 That'll break your stopwatch if you clocking me 
 My concrete jungle is like Jumanji 
 But iller than what you seen in the cinema 
 A five-foot eight nigga with more horsepower than twelve cylinders 
 My brain consists of twin Pentium chips 
 That's double the clocked speeds of a 586 
 Nothing about my physical matrix is basic 
 I kick flavor beyond what your tongue is capable of tasting 
 You'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes 
 It's like a Jamaican seeing it snow for the first time 
 Rhymes of a sort that distort space and time 
 It's like explaining color to a man that was born blind 
 One of a kind, I've got divine chromosomes in me 
 My sperm will scramble the eggs in a woman's ovaries 
 'Cause I'm as original as it gets 
 And I can't respect cats that copy like double-decks 
 I get vexed when crab niggas bite my style 
 'Cause I'm selling a thousand records per day, per square mile 
 Breaking the laws of physics with metaphors and lyrics 
 Speaking to dead poets by conjuring up their spirits 
 From Shakespeare to Edgar Allan 
 Yo, the whole Dead Poets Society couldn't mess around with the talent 
 Much less understand it 
 I make tightrope walkers at the circus lose their balance when I kick the planet
