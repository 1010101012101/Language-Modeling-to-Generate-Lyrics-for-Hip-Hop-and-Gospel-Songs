(Canibus) 
 Yeah 
 I'll buss 'em and you punish 'em 
 Uh, yeah 
 (Canibus) 
 Lemme bust 'em 
 (Rakim) 
 Nah, I'ma punish 'em 
 (Canibus) 
 Ra, lemme bust 'em 
 (Rakim) 
 Nah, I'ma punish 'em 
 (Canibus) 
 Nah, lemme bust 'em 
 (Rakim) 
 Nah, I'ma punish 'em 
 (Canibus) 
 Come on Ra, lemme bust 'em 
 (Rakim) 
 Yo 'Bis, let me punish 'em 
 (Canibus) 
 Now on some battling shit, my verbal lateral grip 
 Keeps my tongue glued to the A D.A.T. when I'm tracking my shit 
 Let my spit lubricate the chap on my lips 
 And make you rappers have fits, 'cause I'm back in the mix 
 Fuck a pad and a pen, write rhymes on the I.B.M. 
 Ebonics is dead, the binary language is in 
 Canibus practices in a room with a thousand candles lit 
 Meditating on this rap shit 
 Because my freestyle reign sovereign 
 With a deeper conscious than the Prophet Muhammad was born with 
 My brain cavity's enormous 
 My left-hemisphere alone harnesses all of the seven Chakras 
 While the right one harnesses darkness 
 The type of dark that makes a house haunted 
 The type of dark that niggas get lost in 
 The type of dark you feel when you dead in the coffin 
 I hear you talking, but I ignore it 
 'Cause it's garbage and your rhyme's boring 
 So keep standing on the corner, the trash-man will collect you in the morning 
 Thug cats fronting 
 Wacker than Blinky-Blink on the back of the rap-tour wagon, babbling about nothing 
 Fuck that, real rough rats can get it on black 
 Meet me in the tunnel where pussy niggas get mugged at 
 So dark, you'll never see the blood splat 
 And you can't even react, 'cause the trunk is where you keep your guns at 
 Now you're on speed, 'cause you're too scared to comeback 
 You can't even breathe, the weed suffocates your lung-sacks 
 Fake emcees haul ass like they running track 
 Wherever Canibus and Rakim is at 
 (Rakim) 
 Be ready and at your best, the celebrity match of death 
 Heart snatched through your chest, cardiac arrest 
 Crack your neck while I break your arms, catch a breath 
 Then I ask the ref "how many cats is left?" 
 One-on-one, who challenging? Come get did 
 All I have is a pen and punishing kids 
 Abdomen punctured and look what I done to his wig 
 "Wanna live?" then I stab him in the lung with his rib 
 Every word I say detach your vertebrae from your spine 
 Rematch wherever we meet at, any place, any time 
 Get your snot-box smashed with the nine, smacked with a rhyme 
 Push your forehead to the back of your mind 
 Try to explain what it's like seeing your brain 
 Your insane, soon to be ID'd as remains 
 Then I reincarnate 'em and kill 'em again 
 Again and again, again and again 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 We started the battle with a grapple 
 The nigga had long hair so I grabbed a handful and chopped him in the Adams Apple 
 His partner in back of you tried to attack you 
 So I'ma twist him up like a pretzel then I'ma tag you 
 (Rakim) 
 I'm on some stone cold shit, warn your whole clique 
 Cartilage get torn until the whole bone split 
 Who wanna spit, bang quick, strangle them with his lip 
 He tried to flip but I left his body dangling by his hip 
 (Canibus) 
 Ra, you left him dangling, I can't believe he's trying to grapple again 
 I swing him around like I'm dancing with him 
 Put his arms in back of his head, and snap them again 
 Grabbed his limbs and put him in a figure six, subtracted from ten 
 (Rakim): 
 Seven birds, make them swerve till their vision is blurred 
 Turn cats that suped from superb to nerds 
 Just say the word, I'll leave your DNA on the curb 
 And stick my dick in your ear and fuck what you heard 
 (Canibus) 
 Lemme finish 'em 
 (Rakim) 
 Nah, it's time to pin 'em 
 (Canibus) 
 Ra, lemme finish 'em 
 (Rakim) 
 Nah, I'ma pin 'em 
 (Canibus) 
 Nah, lemme finish 'em 
 (Rakim) 
 Nah, it's time to pin 'em 
 (Canibus) 
 Come on Ra, lemme finish 'em 
 (Rakim) 
 Nah Bis, I'ma put an end to 'em
