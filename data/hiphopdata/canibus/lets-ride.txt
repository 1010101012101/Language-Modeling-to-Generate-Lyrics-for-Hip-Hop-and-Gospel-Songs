(Canibus) 
 Yo, yo 
 If you just listen to my lyrics every day for a couple of weeks 
 My techniques will eventually kill you just like red meat 
 The Bhagavad Gita beliefs I speak be so deep 
 Most critics get mad because there's nothing to critique 
 Whenever I'm rapping or rhyming with irrefutably remarkable timing 
 I'm like, Charlie Chaplin pantomiming 
 If you John Blaze, or you James Flames 
 Or you Jack Cremation, I'm Germaine Propane (Germaine Propane) 
 No pain no gain in this rap game 
 For the fortune and fame in order to remain 
 Most real MC's, learn to adapt to the change 
 Or get washed away like tears in the rain, in the rain y'all 
 Chorus: Wyclef, Product, Pras 
 (Clef) Just ride, just ride, ah just ride everybody just ride 
 Just ride, just ride, ah just ride everybody just ride 
 (Pro) When you in the streets and you're driving in your V 
 If you can see what I see, you're prepared for the jackers 
 (Can) Old school, old school 
 (Pras) Everybody got to pack a mac now 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, if you wanna know, how I kick a flow 
 When I rip a show, with my lyric-al, I'ma let you know 
 It's difficult, 'cause I'm a part spiritual, part para-physical miracle 
 And I'ma blackout in a minute too 
 Spitting like Bone-Thugs like "Nigga-what? I'm-fin-to-get-a-gun and stick-em-up" 
 Then crush a Thug's Bones with a chrome slug 
 The black Cyrano de Bergerac of rap 
 With the ghetto Anglo-Sax' poetic syntax 
 In fact, nigga don't even give me dap when I see you 
 Just don't give me no ice grill eye contact either 
 When you see me, whyling like Beenie on the speakers 
 "Zim zimma -- who got the fire for my reefa?" 
 Chorus: Product, Pras, Wyclef 
 (Pro) You came home from a bid a nigga was in your crib 
 And the whole time you thought your girl was celebate 
 (Can) Old school old school 
 (Pras) You locked up and she need some di-ick 
 (Clef) Just ride, just ride, ah just ride e'rybody just ride 
 Just ride in the hood, just ride, all my ... uh, ah just ride 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo physically I move at a velocity that'll break your stopwatch if you clocking 
 Me My concrete jungle is like 'Jumanji' 
 Iller than what you seen in the cinema 
 A five foot eight, nigga with more horsepower than twelve cylinders 
 My brain consists of twin Pentium chips 
 Double the clock speeds of a 586 
 And nothing about my physical matrix is BASIC 
 I kick flavour beyond what your tongue is capable of tasting 
 You'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes 
 It's like a Jamaican seeing the snow for the first time 
 Rhymes of a sort, that distort space and time 
 It's like explaining colour to a man that was born blind 
 Chorus: Product 
 (Pro) Crimes on the street, come from a lack of eatin 
 It's not my cup of tea, but I'll give them the BEST 
 Motherfuckin BEST 
 And if you still out here I kick yo' ass tomorrow 
 (Can) Old school, old school (c'mon!) 
 (Pro) And if you still out here, I kick yo' ass tomorrow 
 (Can) Old school, old school (c'mon y'all) 
 (Pro) Frontin like you buyin food but you buyin crack bottles 
 (Wyclef) 
 Ah just ride, ah just ride 
 Everybody in the East just ride 
 Ah just ride, ah just ride 
 Everybody in the West just ride 
 East to the west to the north 
 Ah to the South, down South 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Ah just ride
