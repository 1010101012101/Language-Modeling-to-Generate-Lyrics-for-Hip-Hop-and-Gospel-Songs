(Chorus:Canibus (Pakman)) 
 Aiyo my wrist stay froze (Lemme hear something else) 
 Aiyo I fuck mad hoes (Yo lemme hear something else) 
 I'm a big dog with big dough (Won't you say something else) 
 Yo man you fucking up my flow (You ain't got nothing else) 
 Man I got something else (So lemme hear something else) 
 My chain got baguette diamonds (Won't you do something else) 
 I spit rhymes with perfect timing (You could try something else) 
 Yeah you can't stop me from shining (I'll spit it myself) 
 (Pakman) 
 I'm on my way to ASCAP so I can pick up my dough 
 I ran into a Jacker nigga tryna hit me with flows 
 He didn't know I had a mind to just bloody his nose 
 And let the blood pour down on his white clothes 
 Chhhh... Nigga! You don't wanna cipher with me 
 My name ain't Pakman for nothin', I'm gobblin emcees, Chhhh... 
 Damn yo, I wasn't even tryna take it there 
 Lemme hear something in the ear nigga, make it clear 
 He started going on about pushing a big Benz 
 How he stayed jig, and smoked chronic up with his friends 
 He doing it big and got unlimited ends 
 I just met the nigga, I seen him walking up with his mens 
 Stop fronting shorty, lemme tell you something 'bout the game 
 It's a thin line, from being wack to spitting flames 
 You gotta represent when you be writing them lines 
 Don't be a fucking millionaire in every one of your rhymes 
 I'ma let you walk in but yo you gotta be quick 
 I gotta go, and the shit you spitting nigga, better be slick 
 He started getting busy, I was nodding my head 
 Then he fucked it all up and said some shit that I said 
 Stopped rhyming 'cause he knew he shouldn't have said that verse 
 Looking stupid as fuck, for that nigga it was the worst 
 Yo, how you gonna bite and try to be top shelf 
 Better get ya act together, lemme hear something else 
 (Canibus) 
 I'll give you more grievance than a nigga possessed by demons 
 Walking on ceilings, chasing white lines speeding 
 Like Tony Soprano taking meetings 
 With a psychologist about his emotional feelings 
 And his criminal dealings 
 He even talked about how to make alcohol out of orange peelings 
 'Pink Cookies in a Plastic Bag Getting Crushed By a Building' 
 Was cool until Canibus killed it 
 With ill cannibalistic animal instincts 
 Instant lyrical fitness, could you handle the distance? 
 You don't have enough wisdom 
 The man who gives quicksand resistance sinks the quickest, it's simple physics 
 I get 'Southernplayaistic' and pimp chicks 
 Put my big dick in their mouth and smear their lipstick 
 Come here you stank bitch 
 Tell your man if he don't spit a hundred bars I'ma bust him in his big lips 
 Spit quick like 6-B tip-tronic stick shift 
 'Bis is equipped with a nitrous-oxide flip switch 
 If you hate me why would you recreate me 
 With those that imitate me and emulate me? 
 They talk about me so distastefully lately 
 But they'll never break me, they underestimate me 
 Me and the Killer P and the P-A-C 
 Get crazy with G-A-T's 
 I'm a B-E-A-S-T, you don't want to race me 
 I do mach 1 over an A-F-B 
 No ifs, A-N-D's or B-U-T's 
 A hundred bars ain't shit for a true M-C 
 Shut the fuck up! You should be ashamed of yourself 
 I ain't heard nothing I felt, Lemmie Hear Sumthin' Else!
