(Canibus - chorus) 
 Yo... yo... you can lick shots in the club, I don't give a fuck who you hit! 
 (It's logic! as long as it's nobody that's in my clique!) 
 Yo! you can catch a nigga at the stoplight, and snatch him out the whip! 
 (It's logic! as long as it's nobody that's in my clique!) 
 Check it! if a bitch got aids I don't care who she sleeps with! 
 (It's logic! as long as it's nobody that's in my clique!) 
 Yo! you can even admit, you know who the gay rapper is! 
 (It's logic! as long as it's nobody that's in my clique!) 
 (Canibus) 
 I'm the greatest scientifically inclined mind since Einstein 
 I write blue ribbon rhymes for Nobel prize time 
 Trying to shine with the shit I invent 
 I know I ain't perfect, but I'm 99.9 percent 
 Which means I represent and get deep in thoughts 
 With philosophies like a rolling stone gathers no moss 
 At any and all costs, emcees get flipped, ripped, split 
 And tossed with lyrical brute force, of course 
 Y'all niggas is Microsoft like dos 
 Fucking with me you'll catch a free round trip to the morgue 
 'Cause I ain't scared of none of y'all, word to Allah 
 We can go to war, with four-four's, or squashbuckle with swords 
 Toxicated off the la-la, on some rah-rah 
 I'll blow your stereo the fuck up if it ain't a Hi-Fi 
 Lyrical scholar, in the physical form of Allah 
 Niggas'll tell you that I'm nice with the blah-blah-blah! 
 With the knowledge of my forefathers 
 You niggas can't battle me because I'll quadruple my brain capacity 
 The intellectual athlete accurately rapping so rapidly 
 Yet he makes perfect sense mathematically 
 I happily accept any rapper's offer to challenge me 
 Fifty emcees reduced to forty nine casualties 
 I'll be the last man standing 
 With metaphors a Charlie Horse couldn't put a cramp in 
 It's the Canibus getting busy with Tony Touch 
 The fuck that I don't even give a fuck about, don't give a fuck... what?!
