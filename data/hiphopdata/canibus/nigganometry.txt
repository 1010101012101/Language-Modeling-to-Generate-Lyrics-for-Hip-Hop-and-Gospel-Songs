 Now if a bitch sucks your dick, for five dollars per square inch 
 And gets forty dollars, including a five dollar tip 
 How big was the dick she just sucked? 
 Say, how big was the dick she just sucked? 
 If you a nigga with a watch, that's iced out with enough rocks 
 To make the hottest room temperature drop 
 How long will it take for you to get robbed? 
 How long will it be before you get robbed? 
 Now if your song played on the radio for the first time 
 Four days ago, now the shit is rotational 
 Who got paid off to play it? (I ain't scared to say it) 
 Say, who the fuck got paid off to play it? (I ain't scared to say shit) 
 If you sign a recording deal for less than a quarter mill 
 And your advance is a hundred thousand dollar automobile 
 I know the vehicle was probably beautiful 
 But did you ask your lawyer if it was recoupable?

 You had five shots of coke and vodka 
 Then you convinced your designated driver to smoke a pound of marijuana 
 How the hell you going to get home? 
 Say, how the fuck you going to drive yourself home? 
 You gotta mansion, a Benz, a Bentley and a Range 
 And ain't none of that shit in your government name 
 What pieces of property do you own? (You own nothing) 
 Say, what pieces of property do you really own? (You don't own a goddamn thing, nigga) 
 Now if you take a glass of water, then add two cubes of ice 
 You should see the cup's water level slightly rise, right? 
 You need to watch what I'ma show you (watch this) 
 You need to look closely at what I'ma show you (listen to this right here) 
 If you remove every living animal out of the sea 
 Then wouldn't the world's ocean water level decrease? 
 This means the planet wasn't three-quarters water 
 This means the planet wasn't three-quarters water (that shit is deep) 
 It's 'Nigganometry'
