I speak in frequencies dogs would have trouble hearin 
 Canibus is the lyrical version of German engineerin 
 Raw metaphors keep you high fa months 
 Fly around the earth twice witout refuelin once 
 Ain't too many categories I can fit in 
 When it come to spittin' 
 'Cause I'm overqualified fa tha position 
 The lazer guided lyrical hybrid 
 Creatin' scripts so sick, 
 I gotta arm wrestle my pen to write it 
 Don't get excited 
 'Cause if I ever catch one of you wanna-be's bitin 
 We're gonna be fist fightin 
 So muthafuckaz whatchu want? 
 I got the shotgun pumped 
 You feel like a frog nigga, then jump 
 I possess the lyrical ammo to battle 
 And rip any one of you warm blooded mammals to shables 
 I make examples of you and eat a mouth fulla ya crew 
 The typa emcee you can't out-do 
 I'll battle you on the net 
 I'll battle you in the flesh 
 I'll battle you over the phone you can call me collect 
 I'll battle you for the respect 
 I'll battle you over a blank check 
 I'll battle you wit a gun to my neck 
 I'll battle you standin over the toilet wit my dick out 
 I'll battle you jugglin a hand grenade wit da pin out 
 In a stolen car wit da fin numba ripped out 
 Drinkin' a Guinness Stout doin' a 360 spinout 
 I stay richeous like Farrahkan 
 Puffin on the Marijuan 
 You understand where I'm comin' from? 
 You numba 1 and I'm negative 2 
 Basically nigga that means I'm STILL betta than you 
 Basic mathematic and verbal mechanics of rhymin 
 Behold' 
 I crush a piece of coal and create a diamond 
 On the microphone 
 I'm sicker than those who've Acquired Immune Difficiency Syndrome 
 And every word I utter fa hip-hop lovas 
 Will reflect forever like 2 mirrors facing each other
