(K-Rino) 
 I'll give you one clue to guess what my rap gun do 
 Like kung fu, I got a steel pallet I practice running my tongue through 
 Ninety extra inches my lung grew, I stun you 
 And when I'm done a paraplegic will outrun you 
 You want head trauma, pretty soon I'ma promise I'ma 
 Drop seeds that will blow up like the the unabombers mama 
 Y'all know what happens when I rapper starts yapping 
 I be bionic orangutan hand back stabbing 
 I break light speed surge and illustrate verbs 
 His career was so short his bio was eight words 
 See I'm admitting ya sentence was well written 
 Except this motherfucker should have never started spitting 
 I'm too trifling to let him life again 
 I'm stifling pain permanently by feeding you nitrogen Vicodin 
 See some of the worst speakers that I know 
 Could vegetablise your flow like pico de gallo 
 Boy you got a lot of balls 
 Playing with a dude that can telekinetically extract bricks out of walls 
 If you come in my zone dissing my curriculum 
 I chew your ass out like a flavour in a sticker gum 
 (Canibus) 
 This is the definitive guide on beats and rhymes 
 Or how to get a black eye fucking with those black guys 
 You better listen to what I'm saying and teach yourself 
 Or I'll give you a belt and watch you beat yourself 
 Told you don't make a sound if you do they will put you down 
 Then all I'ma say is, "Look at you now" 
 Hip Hop is not based off risk on a primal level 
 We rhyming with you, not rhyming at you 
 You better understand this shit or get talk to an Arabic banana clip 
 You don't wanna talk to Canibus 
 You talk about bars, my uppertorso crawl up the wall 
 In your house through your window boy 
 Burglar bars get ripped off, bite off your arm 
 Leave jigsaw scars, that's just a doll 
 This is Thunderdome hall, decoded like Sean 
 Laser beam scan the apartment, it's gone 
 Metaphorical wizard, the Oracle visit every four minutes 
 Until I finish, you bring me more Guinness 
 I'm like ______ eating Mexican food 
 With some Mexican dude and some gunslingers too 
 Come through, call an airstrike on your hood 
 Evacuate every bitch that make love so good 
 So what you wanna do? Everybody chilling, we cool 
 I don't have to rip the face off no fool 
 That ain't Lyrical Law, that's a lyrical rule 
 I ain't did this before, I don't wanna be cruel 
 I just wanna be loved, but the world wants blood 
 So we barricade the doors and wait for the noise 
 Nature Boy, my name is deployed, the cave is destroyed 
 If you mention his name, he gets annoyed 
 'Cause boys should not play with psychotic toys 
 A boy should not talk with a psychotic voice 
 Stand before me, don't plead no case 
 'Cause you passed Lyrical Law, you already great 
 Go take your place next to any emcee that's great 
 In the Most High's name we pray, Lyrical law
