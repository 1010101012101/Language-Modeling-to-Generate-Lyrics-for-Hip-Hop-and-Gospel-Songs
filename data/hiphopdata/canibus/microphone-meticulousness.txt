(Canibus) 
 Y'all done fucked up now 
 Oh boy, it's the Brainstream, blazing the green 
 Rip a mic no matter how wasted I seem 
 (Canibus) 
 I wreck that shit when I mic check that shit 
 Canibus, nigga, he the best that spit 
 Fuck the fact I never had a hit 
 I don't need it 'cause I never met a rapper that I ain't rip 
 Walk strapped with a mic, and a fifty minute D.A.T. for the night 
 Just in case your show ain't tight 
 Step on stage and pace left or right 
 Like a lion ready to bite, you dying tonight 
 More lines to your forehead than Brian McKnight 
 Thousand Watt voice-box, I'ma fry them tonight 
 I be shitting on sight, meticulous with the mic 
 It's a mic, but I rip it like I'm palming the knife 
 Lyricist that don't lounge, break a nigga down 
 Says you iced out? You can keep the swelling down 
 Lift you off the ground with chokehold till your bitch screams 
 "Let him down, he's a MicClub member now." 
 Beat you with my brow, force you to speak loud 
 Like, motherfuckers give me fifty bars right now 
 Plus another fifty, that's not a hundred, you spit eighty-six, you trying to tell me you can't count? 
 Throw you in a sweatbox, let you sweat it out 
 One, two, three, four, is one bar, figure it out 
 You civilian maggots ain't ready for the illest rapper 
 Allied Metaforces in the joint access 
 Computative compliance of the rhyme science 
 Protected by the MicClub security advisors 
 Pick the mic up and train, till my voice becomes number again 
 On the murder-tile exchange 
 Too violent to tame, wolf bane pumps through my veins 
 Put emcees to shame, the lyrical linguist 
 Spitting vintage, colloquial English 
 Like, 'who art thou? Bow to the ten inch dick 
 Sucketh it,' I'm the alpha-male of this shit 
 I'm the king of the pack, bringing it back 
 Tell the Queen of the pride to come sit on my lap 
 Her body is spotless, she ain't got one scratch 
 So you can keep them other ugly bitches in the back
