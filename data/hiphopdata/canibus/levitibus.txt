 (Canibus) 
 I harness the power of the Chakra, 
 Remote viewing into darkness, describing what I see in the process, 
 Are stone statues surrounded by Neolithic objects 
 Geoglyphs on the Pampa, 
 A dose of propylamine makes it feel like a dream, 
 The dream state is the playground for the supreme, 
 Critics attempt to follow a trend, today they call me a charlatan, 
 But tomorrow I will be the God of men, 
 To create a universe all I need 
 Is one thousand trillion, trillion degrees, 
 Sodium 22, betatrons and a cloud chamber, 
 Keep the noise down so I don't arouse my neighbours, 
 Got a message from 'The Falcon and the Snowman', 
 In an unopened Coca-Cola can, 
 Show the whole plan in coded program, 
 Encrypted by a ProScan, modem with a low-band, hold up, let me load it in 
 (Canibus) 
 I was created by intelligent design, 
 You are merely a descendant of the unmodified, 
 You diss me out of pride, 
 But when you're finished talking about money and bitches you're simply out of rhymes, 
 Even my worst album was sublime, 
 If I don't slow down I'll distort the timeline, 
 Back through the time tunnel to a '100 Bars' again, 
 A master like the honourable Earl of Caernarfon, 
 The grand architect, 
 Used to be a partisan to Lamarckism theory but I lost the bet, 
 No regrets, you live and you learn, 
 I'm through giving advice, I just give concern, 
 Sterilize my hands to prevent catching the germs, 
 And try to rebuild all the bridges I've burned, 
 I prefer modesty over controversy, 
 But what am I to do when these jerks keep bothering me, 
 Jealous because they can't rhyme like me, 
 And they never had a scientific mind like me 
 (Canibus) 
 I'm above average with verbal semantics, 
 The Aurora Borealis in the form of a rap ballad, 
 They look at me like, "Poor bastard, 
 Why can't you manipulate Billboard with all your metaphor magic?" 
 No matter how hard I practiced, 
 Every microphone I saw, I grabbed it, obviously that's the wrong tactic, 
 I went through a long period of mourning and sadness, 
 When I wrote that Stan shit, 
 But if you want to hear some hardcore Canibus just say so, 
 And I'll come out the egg roll with seven Dead Scrolls, 
 If you can find a better flow, 
 Then I can find a dinosaur on the Galápagos archipelago, 
 Hey, you shouldn't fall for the naiveté, 
 Lyrically I'm the illest when my beats is okay, 
 Food for thought, nutrition for the whole brain, 
 Keep your neurotransmitters warm on a cold day, 
 I'm ahead of my time, or so they say, 
 I guess that's why I already feel old and grey, 
 Okay, that's enough knowledge for today, I'm killing them, 
 You better not forget it 'cause this is Levitibus
