(Intro: Canibus) 
 It's About That Time 
 You know me I'm about that rhyme 
 Canibus and Termanology 
 Two of Hip Hop's top chiefs, watch beef 
 (Canibus) 
 Canibus lyrically fit, Termanology spit 
 A million bars, first sixteen start like this 
 A rack of bombs lay stacked on the floor above the doors of the Bombay 
 I could drop bombs all day 
 Any city, all states, any place, any muscles, they all ache 
 My metaphors break jaws out of place 
 Thirty shots, change cartridge, lock, reload 
 What up Hijo? I throw bullets the size of burritos 
 Prototype speed boats, built by Lockheed on the East Coast 
 Drag you by the feet with thirty feet of rope 
 Got to pay dues dude, put you on YouTube 
 One millions views of that moment you lose 
 Against the freckle faced Elephant Man 
 With cold clammy gelatin hands research and develop the plan 
 'Cause now everybody hollering, Hip Hop ain't bringing the dollars in 
 Radio ain't got no more tolerance 
 Objection sustained, y'all niggas can't fuck with Germaine 
 You can't verify the shit that he claim 
 Just a man in the Matrix, I stand by my statements 
 Every time I run a program they erase it 
 The block unfolds, you hear the army snare drum roll 
 The 'Beat Tolls' 'cause you know I got soul 
 Yo, I rap alone, strap a microphone around my chest like a saxophone 
 Fully automated battle drone 
 Canibus and Termanology, white high speech 
 Black box beats, you listening to Hip Hop's chiefs 
 Termanology, what's the prophecy? 
 Show them how you got the right to rock with me 
 Boy you better fry that beat
