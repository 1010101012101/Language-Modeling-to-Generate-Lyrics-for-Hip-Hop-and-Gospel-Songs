(Canibus) 
 This is Wu-Flix, knock your teeth out with a tooth pick 
 I hear you spitting that bullshit 
 I chop your mamma arm off with a katana 
 And stick dick to your father, you won't ever be the same, grasshopper 
 I'll murder the motherfucker, yeah I know you would 
 There are many things the rest of us would do if we could 
 I do whatever it takes to keep you alive 
 I go outside, knowing that I'm gonna die 
 Standing in the corner 
 I got my Sticky Fingaz face on, count to four, bumrush the door 
 Nigga tried to rush me, I bust three 
 Turned him to duck meat, the 187 was rusty 
 Motherfucker don't touch me, walk around everybody love me 
 Benetton suits and gumbies 
 So if the boy wants to have sex, then let him have sex 
 When he turns eighteen I'll let him sleep with my ex, next 
 (DZK) 
 My iron fortress is protected by the Eye of Horus 
 The vile sorcerer that rides atop of wild horses 
 Settle scores and vendettas, left ya shelter scorched 
 Delta's force melt ya porsche with a welder's torch 
 Never knelt before God, never felt remorse 
 Spinning propellors left fellas short on my heliport 
 In the morgue cellar, fill a drawer with a headless corpse 
 ...My album's fucked up that shit'll never sell in stores 
 My consumer base is viewed as a mutant race 
 Humans that grew from the fumes of nuclear waste 
 If YOU get a taste of my music, you get erased 
 And interchanged with an image of your living wraith 
 Drippin' with acidic hate, pistol-whippin little fake 
 Children when I'm spitting written riddles in a fit of rage 
 I wanna murder motherfuckers with my vocal sound 
 And choke 'em with the smoke that get ejected from my open mouth
