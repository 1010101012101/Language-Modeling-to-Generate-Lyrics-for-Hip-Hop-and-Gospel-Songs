(Sun) 
 Live from Southside, Sun's the livest... One 
 Representing Sharpshooters to the fullest 
 Battle forces of darkness, escape the Abyss 
 Return to salt refuge in the Temple of Bacchus? 
 Where I learn verbal weaponry to conquer my enemies 
 The keys to infinity, words to pure energy 
 Spittin' the livest shit, saliva on some lava shit 
 Sun, Cena, Bis Spitbullz we the livest click 
 Armed for war using words as my weapons 
 We clash like Satan and Christ at Armageddon 
 We turnbuckle titans, We fear these mics like Tyson 
 I go straight for ya ear when I'm writin 
 Mics are hand-to-hand, we don't just throw blows 
 We fight in the UFC, the size of the Rose Bowl 
 Word to K-Solo, battle Sun spells Death 
 Imma cannibal Canibus spit flames and eat flesh 
 (Tha Trademarc) 
 Discrepancy, edit the dialect, the heavy the steady, context 
 Direct spawns loose forever, Circumnavigate, manipulate the center 
 Physical status, anatomy is broken down signs and theorem equations 
 Instead of Arabic letters, activate together, bite my style is like high-jackin me at 30,000 feet in a paper airplane in agitated weather 
 Styles saturated, weighed down like pants with 20 pockets full with spare change tryna leave the ground flappin ya arms with 2 feathers 
 A modest endeavor, divide my body in half and suck the piece of flesh in the center 
 You and me in the same sentence, never 
 That's like comparing a planes scratched the bleeding interal 
 Like comparing a blaze masters fuckin' inferno 
 Scaring every MC out the city 
 Like diving in a pool of razorblades with immune deficiency 
 Publicly with every MC and DJ in the country under me 
 The main reason the world stop rappin' and breathin is what I'm gonna be 
 (Canibus) 
 Spitbullz off the muzzle 
 Airborne off the turnbuckle to touch you 
 Tear bones off the muscle 
 Stomp you, try to get the swamp monster off you 
 The awful scent of bloody flesh and barnacles haunt you 
 Couldn't kill me with a 50 cal round 
 A three hundred fifty pound Hound with a canine growl 
 I scan the road from a mud hole like Rambo 
 The chain-fed ammo open you up like manholes 
 I'm Uncle Sambo with a Ku Klux Klan robe 
 Black face, pink lips Arctic colored camo 
 Spitbullz, whore 
 Let me get a fix on this fool 
 I drool when it's time to get tools 
 Six wolves minimum, interrogate before killing them 
 Water board torture below zero temperature 
 Hot bars generate sparks, bitch, I told you don't talk 
 Fibrillate your heart till you fart 
 On your feet, drag you outside, march 
 Walk till your feet parched and your BDU bottoms starch 
 Feed you pork soaked in sodium salt 
 Big weapons spark like tuning forks in the dark 
 Won't tell you again, do not talk 
 When we walk do not gawk at the corpse laying on the sidewalk 
 Handcuffed behind back, flesh decomposed in crack 
 Heads are detached from the respiratory tracts 
 Crossbow; butt-stock 'cross the throat 
 Pardon the approach I thought you was walking too slow 
 No one who is able to hear will care 
 Those with compassionate care cannot conquer fear 
 The final battle won't be in space but right here 
 Thirty two thousand four hundred Maidenhead squares 
 Sharpshooter assault, Mankind versus The Land Sharks 
 You don't want none of the Spitbullz
