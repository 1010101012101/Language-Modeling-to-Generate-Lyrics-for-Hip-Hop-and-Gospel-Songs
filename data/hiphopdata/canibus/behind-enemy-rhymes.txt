Behind enemy rhymes, when the curriculum storms 
 Behind enemy rhymes, when the curriculum storms 
 It's like this yo, check it out, uh, yo 
 When the Curriculum storms, Modern rap history is reborn 
 On CD code in the form of a poem 
 Anyone that studies Canibus' past, knows he has the answers 
 To questions you're probably not advanced enough to ask 
 Super advanced faculty math, Chairman of curriculum class 
 Eighty-five percentile never pass 
 Ten percentile smile and five don't even laugh 
 When the chalk's in my hand and I'm drawing up graphs 
 I present the contingency plans to the top brass 
 They probably think I'm on speed I'm talking so fast 
 The body of the rhyme is smooth like Body and Bath 
 The summary is more explosive than a meth-lab blast 
 My symmetrical shock waves shatter glass 
 As my U2-35 rhyme hits critical mass 
 'Apocalypse Now', lyrical wrath blow everything off the map 
 From green grass to African baobabs 
 Spike with electromag till aircraft crash 
 CDC in the streets passing out gas masks 
 Gorgeous women thank me for the oxygen tank 
 Baby, the chevrons on my arm will tell you my rank 
 Maybe I'll become another casualty in the field 
 They'll engrave my tombstone with Damascus steel 
 The best beats in the world couldn't rival my skill 
 It's like pouring a cup of water on a million beached whales 
 Grand eloquence of an unprecedented scale 
 Close your eyes and feel the rhyme because I'm better in Braille 
 The Francis Bacon basics, I should reiterate this 
 "We rise to great heights by winding staircases" 
 Lines spiral in a French-curved design

 When the Curriculum storms, this is lyrical law 
 Computer programmed bars come out of digital jaws 
 This is the toughest course in Hip Hop so far

 Behind Enemy Rhymes when the Curriculum storms 
 Written addendum, Curriculum attention deficit disorder 
 Magician flipping them, with serotonin re-uptake 
 Inhibitors that inhibit them from seeing the vision when 
 They spit against Bis and them they must want to get dissed again 
 I'm sicker than your sixth sense, inhale breaths 
 Through louvers in my chest bigger than wind tunnel vents 
 Please believe the ammo is live, a fusillade of rhymes 
 Flies through your ride and gulf stream fuselage 
 Blistering speeds fool eyes with fast rhymes 
 Setting world records for Nurburgring's fastest lap times 
 Get checkered flags for forty-eight tracks of rhymes 
 A hundred times with vocal signatures too complex to sign 
 Human by design, a mental monster of the mind 
 Rhetoric versus reality the reason I rhyme 
 Internally inclined to shine, principles of plenitude 
 I spit at you injure you if you step out of line 
 A transcendental intellectual 
 A marvel to the medical professionals that claim they have more tests to do 
 Before they understand what I'm equipped to do 
 Visual psychoanalytical living proof that I'll rip you 
 I'll rip the roof off like cyclones do 
 When the Curriculum storms I'll rip a microphone too 
 A molecular miracle in the physical 
 My lyrical has always been something different for you to listen to 
 Difficult but legible, forever memorable 
 Enough to remain in the membrane of you're mental pool 
 I'll train your brain muscles and take you to school 
 Hard rocks become gentle jewels, these are the rules 
 When you're in a Mic Club mood you never get booed 
 Aptitude and attitude are your battling tools 
 Stay calm, and spit those bars 
 If you find yourself 'Behind Enemy Rhymes' you've got to weather the storm
