Oh no! He's alive! 
 Rip the Jacker! 
 Master! 
 Please help us! 
 Please please ah! 
 I'm the real king of my kingdom 
 I make my women practice isolationism as soon as I get them 
 Run my world with an iron rod behind iron bars 
 Enclosed behind iron doors in a small iron box in the corner 
 Shielded behind fire walls with water doors 
 Down the gaseous corridor, welcome to my world of horror 
 A coroner with an immortal ora 
 The rhyme slinging highlander Ripper rip you to live longer 
 Get strong every record that I record 
 Morph my arms into a sword and clothesline you running forward 
 You can't ignore Bis motherfucker I started this 
 As far as artists that spit Canibus is dominant 
 Hot shit from a lava pit studied by oceanographers 
 At the oceans bottom with rocket ship sound effects 
 A Ripper in the flesh signed in ink, nigga 
 You ain't ill if you need time to think 
 You talk shit my personality splits, you get ripped and that's it 
 A +True Hollywood Story+ bitch 
 In my world Germaine's gone Canibus is just a Monica 
 Stay behind to follow up and demolish you fucks 
 Can-I-bus (Yeah!) now that's what I'm talking about 
 Call me Mr. spit shit also known as toilet mouth 
 Y'all been warned about a million times 
 I done wrote about a million rhymes since July '85 
 When I'm writing I'm impervious to fraud 
 My fine arts verbal collage is worthy of the gods 
 When I'm 30 years old I'ma quit rhyming 
 Collect my own catalogue and open up a library 
 Lock myself in solitary six months at a time 
 Work at the university and teach sick fucks how to rhyme 
 Nobody's safe nobody can say that they great 
 I'll put a Jacker's whole body in a crate 
 Trap your soul in an electromagnetic face 
 Put the crate on a wide-low rider and drive it in a lake 
 Look in my eyes then look in my face 
 Nobody's here to arbitrate, realise its time for your fate
