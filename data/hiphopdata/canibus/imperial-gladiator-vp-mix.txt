Hip-Hop feed off my breast, and that's no joke 
 If I rap slo-mo I can lactose flow 
 I spit frags at you shitbags 
 16 mags, flashbangs blast like a billion gallons of gas 
 Heat signals from the blunt, make you see the hunt 
 Bump you from the front, hit you in the back with the pump 
 I'm tired of you posers, I'm the rap superstar soldier on the poster 
 Captain cold-crush, star buck your ass and take your large Mocha 
 Star-struck bitches gimme ass and Cho-cha 
 I tuck heat before I brush the street 
 Outside I touch the street, bust the heat 
 Firepower big as lawn-mowers with fire motors and 4 rotas 
 Look like Marg with 4 strollers 
 2 Rambos and 4 Cobras 
 1 Rocky and 400 million man soldiers 
 I command a brigade of wanna-be that are all gonna be paid one of these days
