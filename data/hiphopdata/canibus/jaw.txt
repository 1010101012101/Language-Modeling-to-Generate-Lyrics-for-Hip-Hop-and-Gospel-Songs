Transport rhymes through space tether. Ask Rebecca 
 To watch out for space weather. Have you ever been to space? 
 Never. Whatever 
 Base Jump over the cliff hanger 
 Iron Man suit protect 'ya from the impact pressure 
 Got faith? Go test it. I shred it in one method 
 Spit it and bounce the session 'fore you count to one second 
 Infinitesimal potential of human mental 
 Entombed with views that are central 
 Universally acceptable and generally sensible 
 The general of hip hop sentinels 
 Get lyrical is all I ever do! 
 It all goes back to your thoughts 
 You start by not eatin' pork right before you prepare what you record 
 Jamal told me when I was small 
 My intelligence was odd 
 I didn't understand nothing at all 
 For the most part I still don't 
 Still get busy for real though 
 Good or bad review, its still dope 
 Steel reticle scope 
 Red dot ACOG: That's yours 
 I'm looking forward to them big boy toys 
 Carve the music outta the noise 
 They deaf, so I draw it 
 The non-conformers performance performed by the artist 
 Skis, floats, and whales 
 Icebreaker bow and kill 
 Magnum roof sales for volcanic spills 
 The intuition is real 
 So is the inquisition of the purchase from the hills 
 Do you focus on skills? Or do you focus on payin' your bills? 
 Or do you get greedy and broker a deal? I wanna know for real
