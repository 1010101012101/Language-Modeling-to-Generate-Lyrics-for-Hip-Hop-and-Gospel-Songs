(Canibus) 
 I never freestyle for free without charging niggas a fee 
 It'll cost you a braincell just to cypher with me 
 I'm the type of MC that rocks for the glory 
 I don't give a fuck if you ignore me or camcord me 
 Freestyle or written, spitting with infinite ammunition 
 For anybody trying to go the distance 
 I promise you no less than a hundred-thousand kilometres 
 My bomb threats'll have you evacuating your continent 
 I'm barbaric with the alphanumeric 
 Hitting you with lyrics that separate your body from your spirit 
 This is for wack niggas doing shows and shit 
 'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it 
 (Rakim: "Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it") 
 (Chorus: Panama P.I.) 
 I roll with the wildest niggas 
 West Indian Island niggas, unemployed jobless niggas 
 The foulest niggas, who never smile at niggas 
 Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggas 
 (Canibus) 
 We savages, snatching microphones from amateurs 
 'Cause like women who get abortions, I ain't having it 
 I Rip you, my metaphor content will split you 
 Into little powder like crystals so I can sniff you 
 What I say should be displayed at the Smithsonian 
 Your rhymes are phonier than cubic zirconias 
 Have you any idea what I do to crews like you? 
 How many niggas in my career, I ran through? 
 Coming after ya, blasting ya 
 With the shotgun like a front seat passenger 
 You must be asking for some sort of a massacre 
 I'll attack your cardiovascular 
 Shatter you like glass in automobile crashes 
 When I smash that ass into blackberry molasses 
 Rip your speaker to ashes and kick a hole in it 
 'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it 
 (Chorus: Panama P.I.) 
 You see I roll with the wildest niggas 
 West Indian Island niggas, unemployed jobless niggas 
 The foulest niggas, who never smile at niggas 
 Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggas 
 See I roll with the wildest niggas 
 West Indian Island niggas, unemployed jobless niggas 
 The foulest niggas, who never smile at niggas 
 Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggas 
 (Canibus) 
 I'm the illest lyricist in America 
 MC's can't see me 'cause I'm too quick for the human retina to register 
 I roll up on ya crew quicker than long sleeves 
 At a 'Speed' that would confuse Keanu Reeves 
 So ask yourself, who am I? 
 I'm the illest MC that you ever seen in your fucking life 
 I hop into the backseat of a cab and rhyme 
 Till the meter says 9-9-9-9 
 Line for line, I battle any kind of MC at any time 
 Whether they signed or unsigned 
 With many lines, more lines than a million pair of Adidas 
 More lines than the Bible quoted from Jesus 
 More lines than an African herd of zebras 
 Niggas just ain't fucking with the Canibus Sateevuh 
 This is for all you niggas doing shows and shit 
 'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it 
 (Rakim: "Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it") 
 (Panama P.I.) 
 See I roll with the wildest niggas 
 West Indian Island, unemployed jobless niggas 
 The foulest niggas, who never smile at niggas 
 Some hostile violent, chemically imbalanced niggas 
 See I roll with the wildest niggas 
 West Indian Island niggas, unemployed jobless niggas 
 The foulest niggas, who never smile at niggas 
 Some hostile violent 
 ... Chemically ...imbalanced ...nigga!
