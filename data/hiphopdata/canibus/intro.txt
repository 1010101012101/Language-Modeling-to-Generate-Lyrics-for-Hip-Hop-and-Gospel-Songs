Hey, this is Steve Harvey 
 And I want to thank this brother 
 For inviting me to be a part of this project 
 Preacher's Son, Vol.1 
 And it is music the way I love music 
 It is soothing, it is grooving 
 It is the truth, it's old, it's new 
 It's for everybody 
 Kinda reminds me of when you 
 And your mamma used to sit around 
 And listen to the same songs 
 This is one of the cool soldiers of hip-hop 
 My man, Wyclef Jean, do your thang
