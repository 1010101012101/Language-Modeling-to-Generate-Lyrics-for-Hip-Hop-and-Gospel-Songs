(Canibus) 
 Ayo 
 Hip-Hop music needs a blood transfusion 
 I been trying to give it to them; they don't want to use it 
 Sick with the ink, it's a sin to think 
 Canibus don't blink, he pretend to wink 
 Yo, anything more than what I need is called greed 
 That's what I used to believe 
 But on the eve of my funeral, my body was recoupable 
 My musical policy was renewable 
 Details, my stem-cell got that hemp-smell 
 With a dark-purple chemtrail, God bless Hell 
 'Cause Denzel's stem-cell costs ten mill' 
 One in every ten males could get it for themselves 
 It's deep, see niggas' with rotten-teeth beat-boxing the beat 
 Barefoot, kicking rocks in the streets 
 Staring at the clouds, looking for leaks 
 When it rains, it pours, my metaphors got them looking for me 
 C to the A, N, I, B, U, S, in the flesh 
 Nigga, my breath is the treasure in my chest 
 I've been around the world, and came back like return-mail 
 Came back to cure the world's ills 
 Cold night's in the barracks, hot days in the desert 
 With every other available pressure 
 Yes sir, I start to zone out, nobody knows how 
 A baldhead for a gold-crown, no doubt 
 Cannonball run, no cars, all guns 
 I keep a big satchel of five-star rum 
 I don't paper-chase, I just spit the bars 
 The truth is, I was in debt before I was born 
 I don't paper-chase, I just spit the bars 
 The truth is, I was in debt before I was born 
 Time keep on slipping 
 I know that
