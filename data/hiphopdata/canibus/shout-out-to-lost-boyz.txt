(DJ Clue) 
 Yeah, DJ clue, desert storm, all up in ya area 
 With the lb fam, love peace and nappiness 
 A little sample, but first... 
 My man canibus, gon' rip shit down, ha ha 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 Lost Boyz the beasts from the east up in this piece 
 With a new release on the streets every fifty-two weeks 
 And I dare a nigga to challenge us; I turn the 
 'Love, Peace and Nappiness' into your blood on a napkin in the ambulance 
 Fucking with the nigga called Canibus, just the sound 
 Of my voice'll give you a positive urine analysis 
 I'm a lyrical demon, stronger than crack fiends 
 That smoke two p's with a c in between em 
 LB fam, making the music niggaz dance to 
 And we sip a very substantial amount of Jack Daniels 
 L-o-est, b-o-y-z we lock shit 
 We invested all of legal drug money profit 
 Showin love to each and every nigga that copped it 
 In they Jeep, Lex Coupe, Beema or Benz knocking it 
 Music making you high, giving you that urge 
 To spend two-thirds of the money you earned on herb 
 You're fuckin' with the lb fam, we do what we gotta do 
 You never get the chance to shoot back at who shot at you 
 Nigga, you'll be dead before you reach the hospital 
 Looking at you laying there with blood coming out your nostrils 
 Queens most wanted, quick to clap a nigga 
 Rap at killers who wear carharts and caterpillars 
 Toting the four-pound, holding the fort down 
 Before heavy d bounced to uptown became a ghost town 
 Cheeks, Lou and Thai see eye to eye 
 Spig sees eye to thigh, being the shortest 
 But he still gets busy on the one and two's regardless 
 Heard about the clue tape, so I had to get on it 
 Lost Boyz and desert storm, show us the money 
 'Cause we still hungry, we still got the growl in the tummy 
 We still grimy and grungy, dressing bummy 
 Doin' shows for foreign currencies in other countries 
 Trying to finance me a Humvee with low mufflage 
 Get a production deal, start our own record companies 
 Sign our own acts and rhyme about whatever we wanna rap 
 Decorate our walls with plaques 
 Summertime '89 or better degree weather 
 '97 DJ Clue and LB fam forever 
 (DJ Clue) 
 What? DJ Clue, all up in ya area 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo yo yo hold up I don't think niggaz know man 
 I'm gonna rock some more, check it out, yo, yo 
 Now just by watching you, I can tell that I got you 
 To face me, something you don't wanna do, my rhymes 
 Are too hostile, they'll beat you down in public like the cops do 
 Sit on top of you, make a human pi√±ata out of you 
 Flow as potent as possible, creating obstacles three feet 
 High and rising, like the chronicles of Posdonus 
 The old school Hip Hop is where I get my style from 
 Uptown Harlem, is where I get my lye from 
 My cousin with mad guns, is where I get the nines from 
 Area 51 is where I be getting rhymes from 
 I'm not a human being 
 I'm the human being ill with a IQ that's off the scale 
 If words could kill, a verse of mine'll murder a mill 
 And emcees will be gnashing they teeth, burning in Hell 
 I'm learning to be the head instead of the tail 
 I ain't following nobody else to increase my sales 
 Metaphors are real, like they been forged in steel 
 Stood before the judge told him I was forced to kill 
 And how I went for mines to get 'Paid in Full' 
 Then I went for minds again and ripped 'em out of niggaz skulls 
 The nigga on the block with the biggest balls, laying niggaz 
 On the floor, robbing them too a Biggie Smalls song 
 "Turn your head round," give me the cheddar 
 I'd rather be a lion for a day than a lamb who lives forever 
 "Turn your head round," give me the cheddar 
 I'd rather be a lion for a day than a lamb who lives forever *echoes*
