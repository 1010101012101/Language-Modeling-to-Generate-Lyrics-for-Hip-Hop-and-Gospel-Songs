(Canibus) 
 One for the money, two for the show 
 Three for the first record-label with the dough 
 We on the road, represented by Loeb and Loeb 
 Platinum-sold, golden globe 
 I pose for Rolling Stones with swollen bones 
 Canibus Roc alone like Hov on his own 
 They know me now, 'cause now they know 
 And they can't wait for the fucking album to blow 
 Broads in the background lounging with pounds of dro 
 Canibus, the cofounder of smoke 
 This real Hip-Hop, bang it down your block 
 Drop it like it's hot, nigga, call the cops 
 (Canibus) 
 Yeah 
 Type of nigga with the super-flow 
 You ain't rocking, we gon' stop the show 
 You see shorty in the V.I.P. 
 She want to drink, but the shit ain't free 
 Type of nigga with the super-flow 
 You ain't rocking, we gon' stop the show 
 You see shorty in the V.I.P. 
 She want to drink, but the shit ain't free 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 Sarge, my SupaFriendz dog's in the yard 
 Don't say a fucking word to him; just nod 
 I came, I see 
 And I'ma bust him in the jaw, if you fuck with me 
 M.C., C.D.C., A.T.L., E.B.E. 
 Miccie D sign; he see me 
 Agreed, I see more depth than Imhotep 
 I see no death, that's why I ain't no hero yet 
 Translate the text, I throw scrolls you fetch 
 My style is not even something unknown yet 
 I'm a SupaFriend; come through in a stupid Benz 
 Look at my roof; you see blue-wind 
 That's where the truth ends, but a new loop begins 
 I can't believe what we do for ends 
 Nigga, nuck if you buck, pack if you tuck 
 I bust out of these cuffs, grab your ass up 
 Reach for the pipe, I'ma show you the light 
 You can X-ray my hand, and see me holding a mic 
 (Canibus) 
 When the Canibus is on the mic 
 Y'all niggas gonna get it tonight 
 You know we don't play around 
 Just lay down, better stay down, this is A-town 
 (Canibus) 
 Fahrenheit negotiate price, I load the dice 
 DJ Mowf told me, 'never bring gold to a heist' 
 The sun don't compare, I'm twice as bright 
 The sink goes cold when I put your nose to my ice 
 Everything's right, this is my life 
 My Matrix is empty; I reloaded it twice 
 Mothafucka we can fight, I'm a soldier for life 
 You can X-ray my hand, and see me holding a mic 
 Look at the hand in real-life, I be holding a pipe 
 For spite, holding you as hostage for your own life 
 Too broad for my own britches, spit till a nigga's spit-less 
 The fifth's twist, here, sip this 
 One million mixes, ten million disses 
 Two-dozen bitches move into positions 
 Train not to miss one drop when I'm dripping 
 Listen, you should let me fuck a remix, and don't get it twisted, nigga 
 (Canibus) 
 I drink, I smoke 
 I'm supposed to stop, but I won't 
 I drink, I smoke 
 I'm supposed to stop, but I won't 
 I drink, I smoke 
 I'm supposed to stop, but I won't 
 I drink, I smoke 
 I'm supposed to stop, but I won't 
 (Canibus) 
 Yeah 
 Keep smoking, nigga 
 Yeah 
 Keep toking, nigga 
 Yeah 
 Who the G.O.A.T., nigga 
 Yeah 
 No joking, nigga 
 Uh 
 Can-I-Bus, oh-five, flow live 
 Yeah
