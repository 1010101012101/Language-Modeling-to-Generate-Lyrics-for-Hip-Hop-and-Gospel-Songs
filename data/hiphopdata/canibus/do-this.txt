I'm outside walking the dogs, on my way back 
 Two dark brown mismatched Rhodesian Ridgebacks 
 Majestic Mic Master Maverick, this is Goose 
 Don't crash it, move or get mauled by a mastiff 
 Live, freestyling from the files of whatever 
 The gravity pull your body apart like mozzarella 
 I make you bark till your lungs warp, my tongue's sharp 
 Cut ya thumbs off, cut you down while you run off 
 Heavy swings, snow ploughs, artillery is danger close now 
 You just flow loud with no know how 
 Wow! did I just say _______ 
 You understand what the fuck I'm saying now? 
 The last man to stand and talk to you through a bloody moustache 
 Javelin Fangz, you don't know the half 
 Sourdough biscuits and warmed up beans 
 In my stronghold steed jeans busting 16s 
 Mouth covered, every sound uttered come out muttered 
 Loud buzzers indicate that you're all outnumbered 
 Got caught in the remedy of an untimely loss 
 I'm the boss, don't ever forget that Horse
