(Intro: Movie sample) 
 Once more, it has been done 
 That in order to save it 
 You would have to raise the spectre again 
 I am going to tell them the truth 
 About their ministry of justice 
 But if we didn't though 
 It would surely be cause for war 
 (Canibus) 
 Okay, it's time to get started 
 Don't want to but the forces forced me 
 With the incantatory allegory they translated for me 
 U-M-L-O-U-T, umlaut 
 That's the reason I bend vowels when I spew from the mouth 
 Spit drooling out a very grotesque view at best 
 Burn through desks at the University of Budapest 
 Sitting in a room with a windowless view 
 Concentrating, looking at you 
 Freeze-frame frozen at the very moment 
 The wormhole opens you know Canibus has spoken 
 The circumference of a third eye so vibrant 
 To me, Ezekiel's wheel was just a spare tire 
 My epitheliogenetic fiber was forged 
 In the protoplasmic fires in a black geyser 
 The explosion can be described as a white iris 
 When the absolute began I don't know where I was 
 I must have just been a piece of micro-dust 
 That's why the fuck I love mics so much 
 My micro/macro robotic rap flow 
 The Magna Carta of the entire rap world 
 Mayflower two thousand two phase one 
 Adapt to the pressure gravity has laid on my lungs 
 The Theory of Communication, Claude Shannon's dissertation 
 With a makeover in camouflaged make-up 
 Light waves bend to the weight of Bus 
 Mics buckle with white knuckles, metacarpals crush 
 Acid reflux all over your face, you fuck 
 Grab heart with bare hand, squeeze and spray blood 
 You iller than me? Give me a call 
 Dear Boss, do you mind if I share my thoughts? 
 Psychotherapy is expensive; can you share my cost? 
 In a cushioned room with leather doors 
 Handwriting experts take a look at the letters I draw 
 Excessive roundedness, no space between words 
 Excessive cross-outs, it must be my nerves 
 Rhymes that vaporize, disablize, and destabilize 
 Pray to God, say goodbye 
 Six minutes Vinnie Paz you're on 
 Lyrically this is the liberty of Liberal Arts 
 (Chorus: Canibus) 
 Canibus, Consume creatine and create 
 Canibus, Anemometers analyze air-intake 
 Canibus, The H.N.I.C. that narrates 
 Canibus, Innate intelligent interface 
 Canibus Biogenetic behemoth obliterate 
 Canibus, U-boat fire, you both bleed 
 Mic-Nificently sound emcee 
 Liberal Arts with JMT 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 I'm the God of War 
 The resurrector of the horrorcore 
 The carnivore, destroying you wasn't hard at all 
 I started raw so the haters could see what could happen 
 I was Allah while the pagans were speaking in Latin 
 I'm the origin of science and math 
 I'm the origin of everything you trying to grasp 
 Been dying to ask if Jedi Mind is the real 
 Well I'll let you inside my mind and you decide how it feel 
 I'm dying to kill and bring to you apocalypse 
 I start a lot beef with lots of guns and lots of clips 
 Fuck the head, I'm aimin right for your oesophagus 
 Hang you from a hook then drink the blood your body drips 
 I got the power of the lead a fucking shotty spits 
 And leave you weaker than the Mafia that's Gotti-less 
 With Canibus: get deep like psychoanalysts 
 Vinne Paz the fucking Hand-to-Fist-Philanthropist 
 (Break: VInnie Paz) 
 What? Its fucking Vinnie Paz daddy 
 Yeah Jedi Mind baby 
 (For the people of the world) 
 Canibus baby 
 Let it now be noted 
 Mic Club 
 What's the fucking deal? 
 (Break: Movie sample) 
 That here in our decision, this is what we stand for 
 Justice, Truth and the value of a single human being 
 (Outro: Canibus)
