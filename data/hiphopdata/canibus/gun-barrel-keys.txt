So be advised, my rhymes override the mind 
 But you'll be fine after average recovery time 
 I'm heavyweight slim face, I breath when the wind breaks 
 Breast plates move when I give chase 
 Jumped the boundary like Space Jam, wait 'til I get up in your base camp 
 You gonna have to face the champ 
 Roman shield is composed of a rose coloured stone 
 My sword is honed from Red Dragon's rib bones 
 The bow is quietly cocked, watch, I'm a take the shot 
 If the target ever stands in one spot 
 Tentacles form a loose noose, hang your ass off of the roof 
 Suffocate you 'til you mourn for a truce 
 Introduce you to my people, stick you with some needles 
 Then place you in a bathtub of carrion beetles 
 Go to sleep people, I'll watch why they feed off your evil 
 And meet you in the motherfucking C-Quel
