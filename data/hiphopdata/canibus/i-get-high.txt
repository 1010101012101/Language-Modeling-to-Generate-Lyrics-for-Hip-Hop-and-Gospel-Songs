(Canibus) 
 Funky funky funky funky 'cause you heard it from hearsay 
 A jam that you love but don't be getting no airplay 
 Strictly for stunting when you riding around 
 (Canibus) 
 This is strictly for stunting when you riding around 
 With a Vida Guerra look-alike massaging you down 
 Bitches hop in the drop, take off they top, my belt-buckle pop 
 They gobble the cock, then swallow the shot 
 General Hip-Hop just ordered you to stand down nigga' 
 Beat you up with your fans around nigga' 
 Studio spot-check, let me see what you wrote 
 Motha fucka, you don't want to spit, (A) 
 Fake niggas get rejected, auditioning for heart 
 They auditioning for the wrong part 
 Them niggas' ain't from the hood, they got the wrong walk 
 They all soft, with no thought, all talk, they in the wrong sport 
 In a golf cart, talking 'bout they hard-core 
 With some bullshit twenty-two's they bought from Wal-Mart 
 My gat bark, bite you like a shark, right in the heart 
 Like a mosquito bite in the dark 
 You got bit, you massage it, I'ma lighten your pockets 
 Make a withdrawal, and take your deposit, to split profit 
 My sawed-off blow arms off 
 Insurance don't cover what a prosthetic skull cost, it's your loss 
 Mother fuckers, keep your ears to the street 
 'Cause if you raise up, you get hit in the head with the heat 
 If you dead, you can't eat, so don't be a fool 
 And try to protect your jewels, 'cause they can't protect you
