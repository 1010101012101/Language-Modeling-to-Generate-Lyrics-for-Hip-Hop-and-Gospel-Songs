I'll cut through your epidermal layers with verbal lasers 
 Sharper then razors on the feet of Olympic ice skaters 
 Carving figure 8's in the pavement 
 Judges will smile with amazement till they facial muscles start aching 
 The most dedicated hip hop lyrical patron 
 Busting on Hot 97's frequency modulation 
 Make sure your Monday Night Mixtapes is taping 
 Clueminnati controls the airwaves like free masons 
 Thought I couldn't freestyle, you must be freebasing 
 After this album, tell Universal I'm a free agent 
 I might move to Japan and marry me a Asian 
 Or move back to Jamaica and start DJ'ing 
 (Speaking Jamaican) Prendominum 1, Prendominum 2, Prendominum 3 
 Or I might just stay in New York and murder MC's 
 I intertwine with rhymes like 
 Two girls living together having they menstrual cycles at the same time, like 
 I'll kick a rhyme that'll melt the Earth 
 And ask you in the afterlife if you felt the verse 
 Sipping on sizzurp, trying to stay alert, belch and burp 
 I know I'm the illest, I don't know if it helps or hurts 
 Nobody can copy me, I got a doctors degree in botany 
 That's why I can grow my marijuana properly 
 Listen to my voice New York, listen deeply 
 You are getting sleepy 
 On July 18th, You're gonna get up, go to the record store 
 And you're gonna buy 2000 BC 
 Listen to my voice, please listen deeply 
 You are getting sleepy 
 On July 18th, you're gonna get up, go to the record store 
 And you're gonna buy 2000 BC 
 I breathe in real deep, through the nostrils 
 Charge my lungs like a CO2 cartridge 
 Soon as the air is released the rhyme launches 
 Hit you like a Shoemaker Levy 9 comet, WHAT 
 Can-I-Bus will bust your ass 
 Strike a match against ya moustache, light my spliff and laugh 
 Take two totes and pass 
 Wait till my lyrics reach a critical mass to whip the GOATS ass 
 I speak with the silence syntax of insects 
 Humaneers are in-equipped to hear my E.L.F 
 Extremely Low Frequencies to frequently flow 
 Type my rhymes out in Morse code with pinky toes 
 Bury your body underneath stones, where algae grows 
 Underneath oak trees guarded by 13 flows 
 Can-I-Bus will bust a flow, bust my load 
 Bust all over your radio, I'll bust down your throat 
 I'll bust like Busta Bus be busting for Flipmode 
 And keep busting till you can't see 'cause the gun smoke 
 Like them active volcanoes, mad 'cause they ain't blow 
 Searching for that pot of gold under the rainbow 
 Or searching for that big pot of platinum 
 Down at the bottom of the North Atlantic with the Titanic captain 
 I been rapping since rap happened 
 My passion goes way beyond drinking Don P. outta crystal glasses... 
 HOT 97 "Release Day" Freestyle Part I 
 Yo, Yo, Check it, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo 
 So everyday from Sunday, Monday, through Friday 
 We can battle in 5 o'clock traffic on westside highway 
 If they can see it live, why pay?, I'll slay you in broad day 
 So stop being cocky and try me 
 I'll be downstairs in Hot 97's lobby 
 In about 5 minutes if you think you can out rhyme me 
 To the Ghetto Superstar who plays the guitar 
 That got lucky off Salaam Remi's track Fu-Gee-La... 
 Trust me nigga, every dog has his day 
 I'll chop off your dreds and auction them on E-BAY 
 So yo, forget the he say, she say 
 Rumours are clich√©, I'm just here to talk about my release date 
 July 18th, I gotta be honest 12 o'clock in the morning 
 You should be standing in line for it 
 2000 BC, coming out tomorrow 
 My album is ill you can ask CLUE and DURO 
 Ask anybody you see in the 5 Boroughs 
 Even niggaz that bootleg said my shit is thorough 
 Listen it's not like I'm wack, It's not like I can't rap 
 It's not like I'm not black so cop that 
 Believe that, you just witnessed the sickest MC rap 
 A hundred bars no feedback, peace black...
