(Ras Kass) 
 The beginning of the end niggas! 
 (Canibus) 
 Yeah, we gon' rock this shit forever, the alpha and the omega 
 The Canibus'll make your eyes redder 
 FUCK y'all niggas talking bout cheddar 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Brought to you by your millennium group The Horsemen 
 (Canibus) 
 Four swordsmen (From the land of the lost) 
 Ras Kass, Killah Priest and Kurupt wit Can-i-bus 
 Throw your 4's up or get your vocal cords cut 
 Mothafucker! 
 (Both) Wavin the four-four! 
 (Kurupt) 
 I'm headless nigga, but I packs a big piece 
 Blasting, they let assassins loose on the street 
 Murderous notes I wrote, I lacerate throats 
 I toss fire at niggas 
 Motherfuck a six, the condos is supposed to be flip bricks 
 All thirty-nine of your bitches, pretty-ass bitch nigga 
 I'll throw some fucked up kicks on 
 Next is a small tank top, the spot, shot it up 
 Beat you in your face wit a rope knotted up 
 'Cause we don't give a fuck, the Headless Horseman Kurupt 
 See I'm off the wall nigga, Horsementality 
 A Horseman nigga and that's all I'll be 
 See I'm tired of this Barkley shit 
 Niggas talking shit, I wanna see the streets dark again 
 Let the heaters spark again 
 Police calling all cars off then 
 Powerful as a motherfucking Vulcan 
 My speciality is poetically lyrically energetically ultramagnetically 
 Dogg Pound pedigree 
 Fuck the shiny shit, fuck a bitch, only grimy shit 
 Dirty shit, holocaust thirty-thirty shit 
 Missile click, assassin Sicilian 
 Kill women and kill men, and kidnap children 
 For vengeance in the name of the Horsemen 
 Slice your Achilles tendon, the Headless Horseman 
 And we abide by the code of the streets 
 The makings of a real MC nigga 
 (C... C... C... C) yeah bitch! 
 (Canibus) 
 So just abide by what you ride by 
 'Cause we abide by what we ride by 
 Just abide by what you ride by 
 'Cause we abide by what we ride by 
 (Killah Priest) 
 Motherfucker, it's started, four apocalyptic prophets 
 Appearing outta floating objects 
 Wearing mid-western garments 
 Long trenchcoats wit our hands in our pockets 
 Slapping all you scary-ass rap artists half retarded 
 Swear by our fore fathers 
 Anything you speak, think, or show will be disregarded 
 Then I drag your frightened ass through the darkness 
 Bring you out the other side as a carcus 
 I'm heartless, regardless if you claim to be gods or goddess 
 To me, y'all all garbage 
 I see all of y'all as moving targets 
 And my lyrics be the atomic rocket 
 Cosmic vomic spitting, hitting at ya Vietnam vets 
 Wit military arms and bombs strapped to our chest 
 Casting meteor storms and comets 
 Now who wanna make the next rise comet 
 And be the first one left unconscious 
 After I squeeze your head like the Charmin 
 Fuck around and see a lightning bolt around your throat 
 And squeeze till your head smoke from all the electric volts 
 Satanically sacrifice your ass like in a colt 
 Have your seance inside of a dark synagogue 
 We was lyrically sent to y'all 
 Like demigod to put a end to y'all 
 Spit bites like dogs and get the scent of y'all 
 Horsemen, we be scorching when we be walking 
 Wit the power to put a graveyard inside a coffin 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Let's serve it out like the breeze 
 Now watch me do one-armed handstands 
 And hang these N-U-T's over seven continents and seven seas 
 Streets is Lebanese 
 Be rocking Bogari wrist watches and sniper marines 
 Most of these MC's can't even rap 
 Just modelling, go gold and get big-headed like they swallowin colleges 
 I spit empty gravesites, rap stars fill 'em out 
 You what? Thirty, forty years old and still wack as fuck 
 Me? I'm ain't even in my prime 
 When I write my dopest rhyme, western civilization declines 
 Catch me hopping off the A train in a New York state of mind 
 But I rep westside, so I keep L.A. time 
 That's a three-hour difference 
 So when my bitch is a six, she really a nine 
 In seven days, she'd still be a dime 
 Call me Blaze Skywalker hitting jugular veins 
 Crack open your skull wit a paperate and suck out your brains 
 Kiddo, I be doing my thug-thizzo for shizzo 
 And the wife of a careless man is almost a widow 
 So what's happening, from P.I. to '99 Madden 
 Since police be jacking blacks, I talk to pigs in Pig Latin 
 Uckfe uye ichbe echbe a igginebe and free Keith Murray 
 (*Translation: Fuck you bitch ass niggas*) 
 (Canibus) 
 I kick a verse with six-hundred and sixty-six megahertz 
 Make lightning flash across the sky, every time I curse 
 Six-hundred and sixty-six flashes, give out six-hundred and sixty-six lashes 
 To the backs of six-hundred and sixty-six masters of ceremony has-beens 
 Put a crown of thorns on whoever the king of rap is 
 If he's a Catholic, I'll nail him to a crucifix 
 Then I beat him till he's blackish-blueish 
 Then perform acupuncture with six-hundred and sixty-six toothpicks 
 Beat him with two-whips, with pieces of broken glass glued to it 
 Your whole crew gets bayed and neutered 
 As soon as I aim and shoot at you get sprayed with bullets 
 Your armoured cars and your Kevlar vests is useless 
 I'ma fuck all of you pussies like group-sex 
 You get six-hundred and sixty-six years imprisonment 
 For biting off another niggas' shit, you bitch 
 You got caught, now you on the other side of the law 
 Snitching on mad niggas' in a soundproof court 
 To get some of your sentences knocked off, nigga you wilding 
 'Cause you'll still be in Riker's Island getting forced to toss salads 
 You scared of that, with a phobia fear of that 
 I'ma tape it on a digital video D.A.T., and send a copy to Mirimax 
 Leave you exposed, turn on the Fiction or Fact, so everybody you know 
 You a sucker-ass nigga, father-fucking ass nigga 
 That got fucked in the ass by a father figure 
 Battle who? I bruise and bash you, blast you 
 Autograph you with a bullet wound for a tattoo 
 Delivering mind-blowing rhymes and poems 
 Controlling my tongue when I'm flowing like pilots controlled Boeings 
 When I get bitten, I bite back, quicker than Tyson attacks 
 I don't give a fuck if I don't get my license back 
 So, take caution, the Four Horsemen will chop your head off with a sword 
 Then gallop northwards 
 So, take caution, the Four Horsemen will chop your head off with a sword 
 Then gallop northwards 
 Yeah, so just abide by what your ride by 
 'Cause we abide by what we ride by 
 Just abide by what your ride by 
 'Cause we abide by what we ride by, HA! 
 (All) 
 Wavin the four-four! All you heard was "Priest, don't hit me no more" 
 Wavin the four-four! All you heard was "Bis, don't hit me no more" 
 Wavin the four-four! All you heard was "Ras, don't hit me no more" 
 Wavin the four-four! Aiyyo Kurupt, hit them niggas wit the hardcore 
 (Kurupt) 
 Yeah nigga, I'm headless without thoughts 
 Wit my motherfucking arms crossed 
 I transform from a Dogg to a Horse 
 Took over the whole race course 
 Throw the jockey off the saddle, now who the fuck really wanna battle? 
 *Fading* 
 Got me a pistol, launch it off like a missile 
 Let it whistle, they fall fucking 'round wit the Dogg 
 I'm a hog
