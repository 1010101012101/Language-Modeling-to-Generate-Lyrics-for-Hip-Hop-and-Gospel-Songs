(Canibus) 
 Yo, sitting on chrome, sitting on low-pro twenty-inch Firestones 
 Gripping the road, with the wickedest flow 
 'Bis is a pro, I zigzag through a sly-loam 
 Accelerating, and decelerating in and out of the cones 
 Poisonous poems travel through Walkman headphones 
 Into your dome, osteoporosis your bones 
 Who's the nicest nigga you know, in the year two-triple oh 
 Spit turn into icicles in mid air and slit your throat 
 Drain your carcass dry, rip out your heart bitch 
 I write rhymes using your blood for my ink-cartridges 
 Paleo-anthropologist polish the bones of rap artists 
 After I dip them in hydrochloric waters 
 Can-I-Bus as the seams bursting, perfect 
 Everyday the Earth spins, I write verses 
 My sole purpose as a verbalist, is to make my words twist 
 And connect them like letters when they in cursive 
 (Canibus) 
 I prey on them, I spray on them 
 First nigga to violate, I regulate without warning 
 I prey on them, I spray on them 
 First nigga to violate, I regulate without warning 
 I prey on them, I spray on them 
 First nigga to violate, I regulate without warning 
 I prey on them, I spray on them 
 First nigga to violate, I regulate without warning 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, Yo 
 I'm faster than leopards running across the vast deserts 
 At twenty-two yards per second, to catch me the daily delicatessen 
 With thirty-minutes to eat them, forty minutes to digest them 
 And fifty-minutes for it to pass through my intestines 
 So ask yourself a question; Can the Canibus rhyme? 
 Is a fucking porcupine half-swine? 
 No time to make up your mind, you want to run or die? 
 Clip you while you running by and trip you up from behind 
 My rhymes confuse niggas like someone trying to gangbang 
 Wearing a blue shirt, and red pants, throwing up signs with they left-hands 
 Standing out on the corner of wetlands, with a confederate flag for a headband 
 God damn eggplants, niggas getting me vexed man 
 'Cause I'm surrounded by garbage like Fred Sav 
 And I can't seem to get away from it 
 I dreamt that I stabbed leviathan through the stomach, and ate from it 
 In my past life, I slayed hundreds, in the life before that 
 I played trumpets to warn you that I was coming 
 There's one billion ways to die and I've already tried 
 Nine-hundred million, nine-hundred and ninety-nine 
 When I aim and fire my rhymes 
 Like a hundred cannonballs flying, striking you one at a time, in a parallel line 
 While the art of emceeing is steady dying 
 That nigga Can-I-Bus is still in his prime 
 (Canibus) 
 I prey on them, I spray on them 
 First nigga to violate, I regulate without warning 
 I prey on them, I spray on them 
 First nigga to violate, I regulate without warning 
 I prey on them, I spray on them 
 First nigga to violate, I regulate without warning 
 I prey on them, I spray on them 
 First nigga to violate, I regulate without warning

 Club Dodge; I wrecked that, Limelight; searched that 
 Envy; I murdered that, Club Soho; Never heard of that 
 Wetlands; dried it up, Cheaters; inside the club 
 Fired up, looking for a chicken to tie it up 
 Club New-York; I heard it's hot there, beats be rocking there 
 Too many niggas be getting stabbed and shot there 
 Speed; I slowed it down, the Tunnel; they hold it down 
 Home of the underground; why they always close it down? 
 Century Club; the hot shit, the House of Blues; I rocked it 
 One Twelve A.T.L.; that's the dirty-South bomb shit 
 Synagogue; yeah I be there, Caribbean City; roll deep there 
 Lyricist Lounge; they be some real emcees there
