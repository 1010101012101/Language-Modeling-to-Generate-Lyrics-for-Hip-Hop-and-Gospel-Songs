Conditioning, Endurance, Memory, Quick Recovery, 
 Run with me, among other things 
 The man is wise... Scan through the air with his eyes 
 Cabin air analyze rhymes 
 100 bottles of beer on the wall 
 From a slow jog, to a low crawl, I move on 
 Run with firm footing, calories burn fully 
 Orlando trains and exchange words wit' me 
 Circular breathing, break for hydration feeding 
 No eating, No self defeating, 
 No dreaming, the bleeding has No meaning... 
 Just cross the finish line screaming 
 Envisioning this! is believing... 
 The tail gates fail safe, to move at a snails pace 
 And clover leafa back around to the race 
 REPORT! How do the electrolytes taste?! 
 GREAT! Continue to maintain pace 
 Written, produced, recorded the water then resorted 
 Jesse charted the precise approach coordinates 
 The name Jesse James, NO PAIN NO PLAYIN'?? 
 No plane, this is Tarahumara... on the train 
 The medic in the theatre of athletics 
 Hypoxia Calisthenics... Reanimate the subjects 
 Inject the Celibrex, 80 miles and 12 hours bet 
 Let's get going, no sweat... 
 STOP. Let us watch the horse grow crops 
 That's a bad sign, lets go back... Lets not 
 3 point knee joints, pigeon toed Spike Lee joints 
 Blonde hair beach boy complete point 
 Road Runna, hot Hemoglobin on a cold summer 
 I already won the race... NO WONDER
