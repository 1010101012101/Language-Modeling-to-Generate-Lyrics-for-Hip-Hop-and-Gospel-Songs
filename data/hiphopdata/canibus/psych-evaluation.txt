Yo, some say the pen overpowers the sword 
 The video camera is just as powerful when it records 
 Appalling footage of cops breaking the law 
 Mad at you because of what you saw, now they're breaking your jaw 
 I've been accused of being internally preoccupied 
 'Cause the rhymes talk to me and I talk to the rhymes 
 Clinically induced impulses reveal what's hidden 
 Written prescriptions given by qualified clinicians 
 Lafayette pegboards be spinning on turntables 
 To determine the motor coordination available 
 Those able to speak what I spoke repeat my quotes 
 My systematic treatment approach be deep in their throats 
 I inject the frontal lobe of the brain with a lethal dose 
 Of unspeakable dope worse than opium smoke 
 Well spoken like Washington Post or a Fox News Network host 
 Scale intelligence like Wechsler Adult 
 Nonnormative data brain storage matter couldn't capture 
 A couple of years ago they had to put it on Napster 
 Resurrect Rip the Jacker to rip these rappers 
 For every second the clock ticks I'ma attack ya 
 The C-A-N dash I dash 
 B-U-S gets the last laugh before the critical mass 
 In half the speed of a bulb flash fire will engulf that ass 
 Into a molehill of charcoal ash 
 Only to be blown away by a cold draft 
 Wack emcees got no chance, It's so sad 
 They ask Canibus, 'Will you ever run out of things to say? 
 How much breath can a man breathe in a day?' 
 Needless to say, I think it's kind of deep in a way 
 People be like 
 Bis is too ill keep him away 
 It's a good thing I got patience 
 I've been waiting here longer than Dr. Levinson's time equations 
 Trying to figure out what made men, was it the theory of inflation? 
 Or are we just the product of the ape stem? 
 You think because I'm not on a major I can't bust? 
 And because I come from the ghetto that I can't adjust? 
 Yeah, my disposition was rough 
 But it turned me into a quick learner all I need now is some luck 
 I used to be an undisciplined piece of faecal matter 
 An underdog rapper but I closed that chapter 
 I deal with my adaptive difficulty faster 
 And question my projective technique as a rapper 
 I've lost interest in the battle glory and glamour 
 But I can't control Rip the Jacker when he gets amped-up 
 It doesn't matter we've all got a dark side 
 A loud mouthed Mau-mau from the apartheid 
 Yo, you want to earn your respect?
