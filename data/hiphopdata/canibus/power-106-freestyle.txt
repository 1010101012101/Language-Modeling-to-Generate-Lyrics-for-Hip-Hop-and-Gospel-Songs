Yo, Yo 
 Now I said it once, and I'll say it a thousand times 
 I got thousands of rhymes, the rechargeable alkaline kind 
 You want a piece of mind? Fine, we can take it outside 
 Otherwise you're wasting you time, 'cause I'ma shine, for the one triple-nine 
 Niggas gambling, damaged they eyes 
 Going blind, trying to keep up with these lyrical lines 
 The type of nigga you can't flow behind, without a dope rhyme 
 You fuck around and get close-lined till your nosedive 
 We can rhyme fair and square or fair in the sphere 
 Anyplace, anywhere, you niggas don't have a prayer 
 'Cause Doomsday is near, faggot niggas is scared 
 They stand and stare, as I appear upon a cushion of air 
 With a long white beard flaming, hot enough to sunburn Satan 
 Hotter than white people, taking vacations 
 Out in Jamaica, out in the sun-bathing 
 Sun-baking in gamma-ray radiation, till they skin color look Cajun 
 Mother fuckers start aging, to the point where they faces start shrivel up like raisins 
 And they become cancer patients 
 Take it to a level you can never sustain 
 Cause compared to me your brain the size of a sand grain 
 A pain in the ass that got smacked for saying my name 
 And now you look like an ass in pain 
 Guess what? You got fd'up cause you shouldn't have stood up 
 Sweeter than a handful of grandulated sugar 
 Niggas running they mouth like I can't get to them 
 But watch the shit hit the fan when that cat Can pull up 
 No question, get wrecked in less than a nanosecond 
 For messing with me or my brethren 
 You can't stop aggression, you can't hold back what's destine 
 And you definitely can't coach perfection 
 Be the only nigga standing after Armageddon 
 Take a hammer and smash the stone your name was etched in 
 Then I'll announce that I'm running for the new election 
 Anybody with an objection gets the death-sentence 
 Death by lethal-injection, death by being beheaded 
 Death by getting shot with a weapon, but if you want to be remembered 
 Then death by getting your head severed is an honorable way to end it 
 Yo, Yo 
 If I had half as many bars in gold, as I had in lyrics when I flowed 
 I'd be the richest man on the globe 
 Niggas want to know, 'Is Canibus gold?' 
 That's a stupid ass question, motha fucker, is Canada cold? 
 By the thousand degrees lower than liquid nitro is 
 Five-thousand degrees hotter than flamethrowers 
 I reflect light, bounce off walls and wreck mics 
 Disconnect your windpipe, by cutting your neck with a knife 
 Rip through, everything from tissues to blood vessels 
 My ninjitsu, kill you with the art of tenchu 
 I zigzag, zig, crushing the kid 
 With G-forces violent enough to crush your ribs like pilots that fly Russian MIG 
 Coming to punish you pigs 
 Give a fuck who you is, nigga, Canibus'll get biz 
 From the lowest point on the planet, to Mount Everest 
 I kick the illest shit, spray painting my name across the pyramids 
 The rap terrorist, Professor Emeritus 
 Fuck forbidden fruit, I was eating pussy in Genesis
