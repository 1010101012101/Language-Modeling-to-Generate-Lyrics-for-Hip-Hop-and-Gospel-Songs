I know ya wanna see Can-I-Bus bite the dust 
 So you can bury my body below Earths crust 
 But imma small soldier that stays focused with guts 
 I rip the scab off and lay in the cut 
 Imma extra ordinary military mercenary 
 Searchin for extra intelligence like SETI 
 My rhymes cut through the radio waves like machetes 
 The predator becomes the prey in the 
 I breach National Security purposely 
 To safely return the statue of Freddie Mercury 
 Lyrically wyclef draws 'em free 
 Holdin' it down for the refugee Navy Seal team
