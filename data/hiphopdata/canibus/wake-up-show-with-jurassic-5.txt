(Canibus) 
 Yo, 
 Me and Jurassic 5 in the chromed-out Navigator 
 Counting paper, who want to taste the new flavor? 
 We go hard like terrorists smuggling bombs 
 Blow up a plane fuselage with the president on board 
 Starting problems, bringing drama regardless 
 We get our point across like a trapeze artist without falling 
 Twin-turbine rhymes with four thousands pounds of thrust 
 Can-I-Bus, Can-I-Bus 
 If you one of them niggas that only trust what you can touch 
 When you see me give me a pound and shut the fuck up 
 No diggity, I smack rappers silly for drilling me lyrically 
 The hardcore metaphor war trilogy 
 With a verbal chemistry punks can't understand 
 How Canibus kills a man with less than ten lyrical milligrams 
 Of the illest jam you've ever seen or heard 
 Special operatives rocking this to get the proper burn 
 What! Let me pass it to my man on the right 
 So he can spark the mic 
 Canibus is above the law, I make cops shit in they drawers 
 They won't even dispatch the call if my name is involved 
 While you pray to Allah, reading your Quran and your teachings of Mohammad 
 I'm in my crib studying Thugonomics 
 Punks want to murder me, that's why my burgundy Suburban be 
 Full of secret service security 
 Transporting me back and forth from the Affirmative Action university 
 In aircraft that takeoff and land vertically 
 The fact that I ain't treated like a king is absurd to me 
 From the streets of Dirty Jersey to Germany niggas heard of me 
 Verbally murdering you thoroughly without effort 
 I get drug tested before I can rhyme on a record 
 Remarkable specimen with an audible weapon 
 Processing lyrics in less than one-one hundredth of a second 
 Beef, bring it, bullets and barrel, spin it 
 'F' the nonsense 
 I got the reinforcements to crush any enemies offense 
 With a hundred-thousand horsemen 
 The hardest mother-what on the market, right here 
 I complete in a minute what would take you a light-year 
 Extraterrestrial biological entities with infinite energy 
 Battling for world supremacy 
 Who want to get touched? The Can-I-Bus will crush you 
 With hard jigsaw puzzles and strong jaw muscles 
 Ambushing emcees, jumping out the trees 
 Like Vietnamese in fatigues covered with leaves 
 Interrogating you wack emcees like M-I-B's with dark glasses 
 Asking you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed by flashing 
 Bright lights in your eyes with them silver cameras 
 So when you're revived you can't recall or understand it 
 That's how the Canibus keeps tabs on the planet 
 I use amnesia to neutralize public panic 
 And take advantage of opportunities to do damage 
 I'll pierce your heart with evil thoughts 
 The only thing faster than the speed of light is the speed of dark 
 With the jaws of a Great White shark I'll rip you apart 
 My state of the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp 
 Splatter the brain matter of my enemies 
 With the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy 
 In the back of his cranial cavity, which is actually 
 What happens to any wack emcee for battling me 
 Yo, I'm a nuclear warhead 
 Right now you're provokin my detonation 
 Never test me without proper authorization 
 My lack of patience has cause me to get mad 
 And explode right in front of your face like a airbag 
 Your rhyme is fake, your brain is child's play to manipulate 
 I create lyrics too intricate to imitate 
 Movin at a velocity 
 That'll break your stop-watch if you're clockin me 
 My concrete jungle is like Jumanji 
 But iller than what you seen in the cinema 
 A five foot eight nigga wit more horsepower than twelve cylinders 
 My brain consists of twin pentium chips 
 That's double the clock speeds of a 5-86 
 And nuttin about my physical matrix is basic 
 I kick flavor beyond what your tongue is capable of tastin 
 You'll be so surprised you won't believe your own eyes 
 It's like explainin color to a man that was born blind 
 One of a kind, I got divine chromosomes in me 
 My sperm'll scramble the eggs in a women's ovaries 
 'Cause I'm as original as it gets 
 And I can't respect, niggas that copy like double-decks 
 I get vexed, when crab punks bite my style 
 'Cause I'm sellin a thousand records per day, per square mile 
 Breakin the laws of phsyics, wit metaphors and lyrics 
 Speakin' to dead poets by conjuring up they spirits 
 From Shakespeare to Edgar Allen 
 Yo, the whole Dead Poets Society couldn't mess around wit the talent 
 Much less understand it 
 I make type-rope walkers in the circus 
 Lose they balance when I kick the planet 
 *"Ooohs" and "aahhs"* 
 (Sway) 
 Yo yo, microphones are smokin' right now
