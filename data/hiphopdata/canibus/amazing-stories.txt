Inside the detox box I watch the clock 
 Outside the box I'm supposed to protect Hip Hop 
 The physician of weirdness, bald and beardless 
 Only the minds of the independent can hear this 
 Civilian population fear this 
 Only authorized personnel beyond this point, where this? 
 The hypercube room I don't know where it is 
 Microphone terrorist bare fist with brad tips 
 Fuck with the Brass Monkey, look up when honey's ass 
 Is above me, she a high class rap junkie 
 She's headless, with her face emplaced in her chest 
 Below her breast she a cosmetic bitch 
 The snake eats the canary, they issued an order not to come near me 
 No matter how bad I sound when they hear me 
 Half man half wolf I daredevil off of the roof 
 And land on both twos so don't move 
 Pounce teams listens to Al Green 
 Everybody in town dreams that they saw the same cloud screen 
 The Majestic Mic Master Messiah 
 Kappelmeister the rhyming meat grinder, Code Name: Shadow Viper 
 Metallic hawk talons knock sharks off balance 
 Even went to see a play called Hamlet in all Spanish 
 Everyday that goes by I feel less important 
 If I'm right, I'll be nonexistent by the morning
