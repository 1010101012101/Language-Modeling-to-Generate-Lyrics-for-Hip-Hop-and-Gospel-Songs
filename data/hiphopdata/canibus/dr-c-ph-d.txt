Doctor 'C'... 
 Yo, I plan to build myself a facility before I'm forty 
 A Molecular Archeogenetic Laboratory 
 That can analyse complex poetry data for me 
 Even if it was recorded poorly, how extraordinary 
 I frog-leap over awkward beats 
 Then I separate rappers by their Carbon 14's 
 To determine the age of anything ever made 
 Regardless of how the outside surface has changed 
 I'll put a curse on your name, bombard your brain 
 With gamma X-rays until you burst into flames 
 With my scientifically quantifiable megalo-maniacal viable style 
 It's like trying to ride a bull 
 Let's have a dictionary duel after school 
 Check me into a nice Cedars Sinai room 
 So I can get sick as the flu, spitting the truth 
 If you ain't got this album you're missing the proof 
 Prepare for your doom, my nuclear rocket plumes 
 Glow against the pale background of the moon 
 Toxic fumes spoil complete stocks of fruits and foods 
 Burning flammable boxes of booze 
 Got in the groove even though I'm not in the mood 
 Motherfucker you didn't win because I can't lose 
 Give the fans a chance to choose? Fuck you 
 Who's the illest? Who's it really up to? 
 Rapid fire, you better run for the pacifier 
 Tie you up and drag you in the saliva quagmire 
 'Til your oxygen expires and your lungs dry up 
 Cause you said Bis ain't dope, you're a damn liar 
 Assassin for hire over beats by Payas, flow like the Tigris 
 Euphrates with the eye of the tiger in my iris 
 Canibus is a fighter, motherfucker my great grandfather was Irish 
 Let's roll the dices, I'll break you like young Tyson 
 Give me the mic man, I don't need no hype men 
 Put a thousand on me, put one on him 
 I'll tear off his limbs, throw him in and tell him to swim 
 Yo, I'll soak that sugar coated shit in soy sauce 
 Tell the FCC boss, "Turn that noise off" 
 Call Detroit's Mafia boss, tell him 
 'Yo, I've got a job for you, I want you to bust his balls 
 Drop him off by Niagara Falls 
 Write my name on a banana and put the banana between his jaws 
 Nobody disrespects lyrical law 
 I'm the best there ever is and the best there ever was 
 Train like a grunt face down in the mud 
 With blood, sweat and tears sucking it up 
 Yo, you wonder where I am right now 
 I'm probably somewhere on the microphone fucking it up 
 Dead or alive Canibus will live through the rhyme 
 To be the illest on the mic is a mission of mine 
 Spitting divine, you can't get it twisted this time 
 Vocal with a mirror to make sure my lips align 
 Doctor C, Ph.D., graduated from UMG 
 Bright as the LCD display on a new MP 
 Prototype of a true emcee 
 With 3-D topography maps you can't see 
 The butcher on Broad Street wrapping CD's 
 In butcher paper, doing artwork with Sharpies 
 If you don't like the quality then talk to me 
 What the fuck you on a website for you creep? 
 Punching the keys, remember that sound 
 That's exactly what it sounds like when I'm punching your teeth 
 Kick a rap bitch! If you've got the gumption to speak 
 Stand next to me I might put a lump in your meat 
 Diss you and your man, double the beef 
 To tell you the truth I thought your rebuttal was weak 
 'Round the Outside' blah blah, etc., etc 
 The body of my literature is bigger than South America 
 Nigga look, this is all I've got to say 
 Suck my P-H-D-I-C-K
