(Intro: Canibus) 
 Lyrical Noir 
 This is Lyrical Law 
 Say it some more 
 Lyrical Law 
 Lyrical Noir 
 "I'm sick and tired of what you've been saying about me in the media" 
 Yo 
 (Canibus) 
 Give me some more slack on this rope 
 I run your boney ass throat over in a zodiac boat 
 46 degrees north, 6 degrees east 
 The Large Hadron Collider gave birth to a beast 
 That speaks, they quote my speech 
 Vocal motifs over dope beats, all lyricists know me! 
 That's why the industry's debunking my lyrics 
 With digital trunking equipment, they don't want you to listen! 
 The Ripper's language won't appeal to the masses because they look past it 
 Only the masters know the seal of the scarab 
 Some humans are born average based off environmental circumstances 
 You organic piece of shit, you substandard 
 But do not be embarrassed by your underdeveloped status 
 It's up to you to find the right questions and ask it 
 Research leads to results sometimes we find meaning after 
 Other times they're just meaningless babblers 
 Don't believe these rappers, fake unbelievable bastards 
 Comet Elenin is coming straight at us, don't believe NASA 
 Take matters into your own hands 
 Stop being slow and acting like hoes, get with the fucking program 
 Hip Hop is the greatest genre known to man 
 If we focus, the poetry is so advanced 
 We can overthrow any plan and control man 
 You got soul? Let's Jam! Lyrical Law I'm the Canibus Man 
 What's the buy-in minimum? 88 sales, program 
 And the number of stores, I don't care no more 
 This is Lyrical Law Noir hardcore raw Metaphors for you and yours 
 You can't say you wasn't warned! 
 Thousands of bars, them dummies couldn't stomach my bars 
 They rather conform, they throwing up their pompoms 
 You don't wanna wrestle with Armstrong 
 We sever blood vessels tryna mess with the God's poem 
 Damage any motherfucking beat that I rhyme on 
 Connect to the God's thoughts, possess your iPod, I grind hard 
 Intellectual hardboard, take it back to Hip Hop Style Wars 
 Grunting like a pack of wild boars 
 Power source Lyrical Law my bomb squad full force 
 Call 'em off we got too much torque 
 Nitrous Oxide Bars pull a bull of course 
 Pitch fork to you neck just to prove I'm raw 
 Iron horse, smack DVD, Battle Rap dwarf 
 Slap you with the flat part of the sword, now you back for more 
 Passing yourself off like a Rap star 
 But you support wack bars that's why rap has lost -- fact! 
 You a Cool J crack whore, 
 You snitch like police Labradors tryna sniff out sasquatch 
 Man up, no more lip service and back wash 
 Stand up! I'ma break off you're back paws 
 Thor's hammer crack jaws, attack y'all, fracture your skull 
 Mountain man axe to your loins 
 Self-employed like Donald Goines, cash cows on steroids 
 I don't fall for deceptions or decoys 
 I'm a beast and I'm clairvoyant 
 Your soya won't tear the beat up whether or not you appear on it 
 Double trouble dear promise fuck you and your comments 
 The chairman of Lyrical Law will be honoured 
 The last man standing, after the internet is abandoned 
 James Cameron with a gamma ray cannon 
 ... Brainwashed Hip Hop 
 And they came from Saturn, they were the first alien race of rappers 
 They landed in North Africa, their teeth be gnashing 
 Their names look like acronyms, they released the Kraken, 
 They live in underground cabins 
 They slither fast through the inner-earth labyrinth 
 They move in S-patterns though deep planet chasms 
 I chase 'em and trap 'em, detailing the action 
 For tryna desecrate the Sabbath of the lyrical master, faggots 
 I laid them on top of each other like Abu Ghraib 
 They spacecraft look like the Eiffel Tower in Paris 
 They pray on my downfall they orchestrated Hip Hop's imbalance 
 They underestimated my talent 
 I hold the globe up like Atlas 
 They lied about Canibus -- ask 'em 
 I'm the world's greatest motherfucking rapper! 
 They slandered my character through private and public propaganda 
 They tell the people I'm Dr. Doppelganger 
 They ask me shit, that they know I'm not gonna answer 
 Extinction Level Event, they can't stop the disaster 
 Cocksucker stop the camera, 'cause you know that I'm a miserable bastard 
 I crack lens, break microchips and melt plastic 
 You Canibus? - Who's asking? 
 That's Captain Cold Crush to you maggot, you a lyrical has-been 
 Lyrical Law's a classic they can't get past it 
 The beats, the rhymes, the features, every single facet 
 Lyrical Law's a classic they can't get past it 
 The beats, the rhymes, the features, every single facet 
 The microphone assassin 'bout to get at 'em 
 The Dragon of Judah breathe fire till his last breath 
 Full Battle Rattle in action lyrical Metal Jackets 
 Coming through with several new attachments 
 Computers is crashing, hackers is laughing 
 Rapid eye movement, try to keep up with the captain, what's happening?
