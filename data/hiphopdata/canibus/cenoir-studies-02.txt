(Canibus) 
 Yo, the artists come and go, so does the show 
 So does the doe, nothing lasts forever you know 
 It's all about the experience and what you take from it 
 What you learn in the process, what you make of it 
 Number two in the world, at the top of the summit 
 I loved it, should have packed a parachute for the plummet 
 Now I'm humping these klicks crawling through mud pits 
 With guns and hundreds of clips on Uncle Sam's budget 
 A hundred rifles for self 
 Handcuff Burt Reynolds to Jim Brown and escape with Rachel Welch 
 Isn't my queen lovely? 
 Feed her rum and raisin ice cream shower her with diamond rings and money 
 Twenty three hours a day I study 
 Dreaming about beautiful women, I hate you gay Teletubbies 
 Dreams keep me alive, you can't take them from me 
 The battlefield is bloody, mean and ugly 
 My adrenaline rushes when the enemy rush me 
 Trying to bust me because I swore I'd defend my country 
 If I could choose between being lucky and having money 
 Nothing negative could ever touch me 
 What must be is ultimately not up to me 
 But I'll sacrifice my life for yours if you trust me 
 Pin my medals upon my chest 
 So I can left, right, left into certain death 
 God speed and God bless 
 In the end I hope God is impressed if I'm put to rest 
 I did what I came to do, no time left 
 Say my name out of the blue because I rhyme the best 
 MicClub.net see me live in the flesh 
 You can come and download every rhyme that I spit 
 You can pay homage to Rip for one dollar a clip 
 None of those rhymes is on the album bitch 
 It's a storage facility where I keep my shit 
 For the students in the class that want to peep my shit 
 Break a bootlegger leg if he leak my shit 
 If you don't want to sign in bitch, then eat my shit 
 Drink my piss, you could never compete like this 
 I'ma give you an example how deep I get 
 Technology not available for purchase 
 My brain collects, stores and converts million bar verses 
 At a standoff distance at a thousand feet 
 I illuminate the target and pound him to sleep 
 To within one micro inch if you're out in the street 
 I could close my ears and still move my mouth to the beat 
 Dial up to your network and make your files delete 
 Count to three, listen to your browser beep 
 Too late, foot already stepped in the faeces 
 Doctor Norton's too sick to help your PC's 
 Virtually I'll make your virtual memory freeze 
 With a weapon of mass destruction, WMD 
 I'm a TMC, trouble to emcees 
 Destroy colonies with UCAV's 
 I'll send in no less than twenty A-Teams 
 Wipe you out before I even get to the B's 
 With my transatmospheric space based mirrors 
 Can you write that out without typographical error? 
 Dumb fucks, I'm the best ever, whatever 
 Divide eighteen by six, you get the third letter 
 From the lowest earth orbit up to the heavens 
 I'll bomb y'all with lyrics of flechettes and pellets forever 
 As a spitter I'm still tougher than leather 
 I had to go underground to get over the pressure 
 Battle rap from the Renaissance, multi-megawatt 
 Bury you beneath the bedrock on a bed of rocks 
 I could never get bored, I'll write about Huxley 
 Versus Wilberforce, fuck writing a killer chorus 
 The Copenhagen curriculum of metaphors 
 Everything from Bob Marley to Tenor Saw 
 To System of a Down song number fourteen 
 I see 'Aerials' in the sky when I dream 
 The end is near, I wish it would hurry up 
 I feel nano-bacteria burning me up 
 Before I explain in detail, you should analyze 
 The Mars' mineral samples under my nails 
 Sometimes I wonder whose listening 
 The auditory Pavlovian conditioning is so sickening 
 My adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thiamine 
 Is really what makes me rhyme supreme 
 As soon as I hear the beat, bada-bing 
 You've gotta think, "A hundred bars? Damn that's a lot of ink" 
 Eventually all of my albums will be out of print 
 There will be a clone for every style I invent 
 For every line I rhyme intense 
 For all the time I spent, every word I spit since '96 
 If you can input at a hundred, I can output way above it 
 If we're in public I'll double it 
 Put this on your study list and go study bitch 
 Basically quoting Hammer, "You Can't Touch This" 
 I'm too assertive and alert, for what it's worth 
 My best piece of work is still yearning to be birthed 
 Class dismissed 
 Cenior Studies from Canibus 
 (Outro: sample) 
 There is something mystical, but it's not rare 
 And nobody should treat it as though this is something special 
 That writer's do 
 Anybody--anybody born physically able in the brain 
 Can sit down and begin to write something and discover 
 That there are depths in her soul or his soul that are untapped
