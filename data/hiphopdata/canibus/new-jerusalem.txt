This is squad leader Romeo Tango Juliet to Eastborn, report 
 Contact is ranged correct, fire for effect 
 Ground surveillance radar, Eastborn get set 
 I'm in the basement, my brain is racin' 
 I can commit psychic assassination from brain entrainment 
 Communication through short wave 
 My headquarters enclave is a dark cave not far away 
 Central headquarters on the corner of four borders 
 Rich vegetation resources and clean water 
 Get close to the ground to detect the direction of sound 
 I take a second to inspect my rounds 
 They tryin' to battle, I'm tryin' to master superluminal travel 
 So I ain't got time to get at you 
 I went to bastard school to learn how to harass you fools 
 And to turn swamp gas to fuel 
 The first shall be last and the last shall be cruel 
 But that's because of all the bullshit we went through (true) 
 I melt the polar icecaps to slush 
 Can-I-Bus is the reason Iceland is bankrupt 
 Call up Eastborn to crush ships 
 Synchronize brainwaves heartbeats and hormone production 
 How, who, what, when? They don't know nothin' 
 But if they shut the fuck up they might learn somethin' 
 Private Pal, you want to freestyle? 
 What is your major malfunction? 
 This is way deeper than us, kid 
 This is the resistance, this is called lyrical fitness 
 Western civilization completely missed it 
 Transparency is key to the truth 
 My spiritual equal can be found speakin' to indigenous youth 
 The underground bunker buster proof 
 A control room in the booth, Eastborn we did it just for you 
 Copy 
 We keep it a hundred, New Jerusalem is comin' 
 You better start runnin' 
 You color, your race, your creed has no meanin' 
 We all sound the same when the planet is screamin'
