(Canibus) 
 I'm probably what you would call a 
 Record industry population enforcer 
 I slaughter like, a hundred rappers each quarter 
 In order to keep this shit in order 
 I track wack niggas down, from border to border 
 Just like the stories of the hare, and the tortoise 
 The rabbit was faster, but fell asleep in the forest 
 But lost, 'cause the tortoise had endurance 
 I always stay focused the longest 
 I promise I can battle any artist till they just get exhausted and forfeit 
 With actual, super-natural forces, I'm a horseman from Hell 
 Immune to the garlic water, and the crosses 
 After the last album, I went through a metamorphosis 
 And probably fired more of my niggas than Doug Morris did 
 I kicked the dead beats out, turned around and switched my whole team out 
 Now I got some banging ass beats now 
 It paid off, 'cause I came off, like Adolf 
 And I can murder any motha fuckin' camp I concentrate on 
 With the first strike, I'm so nice 
 I can exterminate more niggas than the Third Reich 
 The way I burn mics 
 I've been accused of being all hype 
 All bark, and no bite 
 Every night I got into a bar fight 
 Defending my title, 'cause niggas was like, "yo 
 Yo, I ain't feeling yo' shit" 
 And I had to beat they ass with Tae Bo 
 You read somewhere that I was wack? 
 Must have been a typo 
 Out of a grand, I got 755 votes 
 For freestyle champion, two years in a row 
 The type of shit I be spitting 
 Y'all niggas ain't even close 
 You wonder why I do this, I do this because I find it therapeutic 
 For all the enthusiasts that love my music 
 You're stupid; my brain's faster than Cray computers 
 With microprocessors submerged in cryogenic fluids 
 On some rude shit, I put voodoo on your two-inch 
 Tell you that you better not use it, then bootleg your new shit 
 You think that you can fuck around? Prove it 
 You got a beat? Loop it 
 You got lyrics? Then flip something to it 
 And stop talking behind my back, you bitch 
 You faggot ass fools get mad 'cause niggas know that you blew dick 
 Trying to get on some whoop de whoo shit 
 I don't give a fuck, what you or your crew think 
 Because I know where you live 
 And I got the address to your crib 
 Plus the bazooka that I'ma use to remove it, 'cause I'm a sore loser 
 And losing is off limits, especially when Canibus is involved in it 
 Spitting some wicked ass lyrics 
 Four sacrilegious niggas, that'll rip your Adams apple out in a minute 
 And play two-on-two tennis wit it, bitch 
 Fuck the critics 
 I'm the illest
