(Intro: Canibus) 
 The HRSMN, Apocalyptic Reinforcements 
 Let's get it on then 
 (Canibus) 
 HRSMN rhyming again, let's not even pretend 
 The speech blend, you hear something you never heard before them 
 I devour prey every hour a day 
 Why the fuck would they give a fuck about what I say? 
 Supernatural astral channel, the deity of battle 
 The power of papple in the Tower of Babel 
 "Craig Mack, one thousand degrees" 
 Fight naked so you can't hide nothing up your sleeve 
 Beyond the Universe and back 
 They collapse when I'm done with that, Bis be all over the track 
 You better kneel before Zod and his two-hundred pound bulldog 
 Or you can fuck off and get a real job 
 Pick the phone up, identify the numbers pushed 
 Dial 626-Kush, they bring bush 
 Black face take over the place, give me space 
 We participate every Iditerod race 
 Both dog hard camouflage face frogs 
 Kaleidoscope bars and asymmetrical war 
 War on my medical card, last name Horse 
 When you step to me you telling me you tryna' get lost 
 I'm a Horseman
