 Yo, yo 
 Ayo, nobody can flow with 'Bis, rock a show with 'Bis 
 Or go toe to toe with Bis, none of y'all can coexist 
 We living in an Ice Age, and it's cold as shit 
 A hundred-thousand dollar price range; niggas is frozen stiff 
 All I know is this, my felt tip, hotter than Hell get 
 A hundred eighty six thousand miles per sec can melt flesh 
 Give a nigga a tan, aerosol cans expand and explode in my hand 
 While I promote that new Canibus jam 
 Niggas feel it underground with stalactites hanging from the ceiling 
 I'm out on tour with thirty city trips 
 Every state is like bitches be bulimic for dicks 
 Screaming the chorus, half unconscious, I hold my cordless 
 Smoke the most enormous trees in the rain forest 
 While the people go insane for us 
 I pierce a cloud and make it rain on us 
 Break the equipment and tell the engineer that I ain't paying for it 
 I freestyle the whole set 
 Kicking a hundred bars, nigga fuck who's on next 
 Phuk U 
 (Canibus) 
 Fuck them extra niggas that's always around you 
 Fuck niggas that talk about you and try to clown you 
 Fuck niggas you run into that never did nothing for you 
 Fuck niggas that's lying telling people they discovered you 
 Fuck niggas that's jealous 'cause you nicer than them 
 Don't give a fuck who you offend you got to fight till the end 
 If you fuck a groupie chicken when you out on tour 
 Smoke a little bit of weed with her then fuck her some more 
 Tell her to bring three friends so you can fuck all four 
 Menage-a-trois, what the fuck she expect, you a dog 
 Almighty God blessed you with a dick and two balls 
 So if you like to fuck pussy that don't mean that you wrong 
 Unless you fuck it raw dog, I fuck a nappy dug out 
 Bust in her mouth, kick her the fuck out 
 She'll cuss me out, like 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, yo 
 Your superstar status don't mean shit to me 
 Lyrically sucker emcees still get frequency 
 Try to diss me now, how you sound? 
 Yo, whoever signed you, must be running the circus 'cause you a clown 
 You a rapper with a drug habit, hiding the truth 
 Camouflaging your needle tracks with some colorful tattoos 
 You was never equipped for this, never equipped to spit with Bis 
 I'm swift as shit, let me point out the main differences 
 You magnificent, I'm Mic-Nificent 
 Yo, I'd even go out on a limb with it, say you write a little bit 
 That don't make you a tight lyricist, cause you don't practice or stick with it 
 Look at the sixty hour shifts I spend with this 
 I never quit, I got a gift for the art 
 A low maintenance cost, no physical moving parts 
 In ninety-eight, niggas thought I was God 
 How the fuck did that change, I'm still one of the illest niggas in the game 
 So look inside yourself and tell me what you see 
 If you see a hungry nigga then you looking at me 
 And its aight if you don't trust me, 'cause I don't trust you 
 As a matter of fact I'll probably bust you, mother fucker, fuck you
