(Canibus) 
 Dog, the snake eats the canary 
 They issue the order not to come near me no matter how bad I sound when they hear me 
 Reasonable doubt settin' in, but no matter what you wanna ask you can't question that the rhymes are infinite 
 The taser to the throat discharge a million volts 
 The bolts in your skull smoke from the Frankenstein flow 
 I've got love for my alien friends, Niobium, Titanium, 'ranium, Copper oxide, say it again 
 After I kill death only life'll be left 
 When the song disconnect your right through your left 
 Never stereotype, but it'll be a sound burial tonight if I catch you on the karaoke mic 
 Clippin' ma whiskers, handlin' ma goatee business 
 Call upon your witness, Canibus'll spit encrypted 
 Step to the stage like I'm practicin' kicks in the cage 
 You can't bring clicks to this game 
 Enter the key code, the light goes from green to gold 
 The beat upload, get ready for the xenophobe flow 
 From outta the wormhole where I barely heard the words that were spoke 
 RTJoo 
 I sit on the throne of Mastodon bones, slaves below moan tryna master the poems 
 If Hip-Hop is dead, then what the fuck are you supposed to do if you a full-fledged Hip-Hop head? 
 (Shan51 mix) 
 Rip the Jacker got you chemically dependent, tryna kick it 
 Harder than havin' a body with all six senses 
 My sick sentences cut you down with a quickness 
 Gaze into my crystal ball bitch bear witness 
 I've got a sick sense of humor, motivated to give you a brain tumor though the motherfucking computer 
 Automatic sentry gun, the old nerd is not even home I stand guard over the master throne, move and I'm blasting you two ways 
 Got a 'Lizard Beast Face'? I'm Jedi from thy space 
 We both agree you not fucking with me, you outta know your place 
 Smart bombin' all targets, whatever it take 
 To turn you fake rappers into ghost signals in the mixtape 
 Poison spit turn yo' head into eggs and pancakes 
 Eat your skull like a Concord grape that taste great 
 Transform before you can even finish saying "wait" 
 You are late, I already got a 'Lizard Beast Face' 
 (Canibus) 
 'Lizard Beast Face' eat red meat from deep space 
 Eat your heart like strawberries off a cheesecake 
 Rip the Reptile escape before his release date 
 He go crazy if you talk about something he hate 
 You wan' talk about 'Second Round Knockout'? Watch out 
 You can't fuck with ten thousand bars, you a cop-out 
 Nobody got what I got now, whether you like it or not Rip the Jacker own Hip-Hop now 
 Canibus can stop now, I took 'em off the clock now 
 You can't battle the nigga robot style 
 Cyclops growl, his teeth look like a rock pile 
 I've seen him bite a fuckin' long barrel off a .50 cal 
 The eagle face watches from above the clouds 
 The 'Lizard Beast Face' watches anything that touch ground 
 You don't understand? Let me bus' it down 
 You can spit a billion bars tomorrow, 'bout it means nothing now 
 Get out, get on your job and run it down for your honor 
 Do it out of respect for your 'Author Poor Pauper' 
 Gun-battle with supernatural giants from Gulliver's Travels 
 Who ain't riding? Get the fuck out the saddle 
 'Lizard Beast Face', you couldn't even conceive what it takes for an emcee to emcee this way 
 So shut ya' manhole or I'ma hafta shut it for you 
 The 'Lizard Beast Face'll' transform and destroy you
