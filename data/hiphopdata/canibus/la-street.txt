(Canibus) 
 You're dressed like a mountain man mixed with Tarzan 
 I'm dressed like gigantism with large hands 
 Connected to a relatively small man 
 We in a sardine can, niggga right on barham 
 Park next to rocky the rams dark van 
 I spit this for Hip Hop, The Canibus Man 
 You can say what you want, I can live with that 
 But don't call an emcee wack behind his back 
 You wanna say it on a track, better be able to back 
 Better be able to react, better be able to pack 
 Better be able to understand what comes from that 
 Your family won't even get no insurance back 
 The poor always walk to the back of wherever they at 
 Unless they went there to rap 
 Camera snap not even as fast as the phantom attacks 
 The camera flash is not even as fast as that 
 Your not living out a ghetto, so you ain't there 
 'Cause you know you got money, so you don't care 
 Attackanistic explicit, show them a wicked 
 Nobody cannot pirate this when Bis spit it 
 Ma rip it, caps on liquid a wicked 
 Nobody cannot tell me about music business 
 Badness, they call it ninjaman madness 
 Melatonin Magik, them man them are godless 
 Yo hablo por La Street, veinte-doce is what I speak 
 If you love Hip Hop then join me 
 Mr Chaos rip the beat for La Street 
 Ahora, we meet, the Beast from the East 
 Mr.Chaos, el toro, el dragon, the BEAST 
 La Street
