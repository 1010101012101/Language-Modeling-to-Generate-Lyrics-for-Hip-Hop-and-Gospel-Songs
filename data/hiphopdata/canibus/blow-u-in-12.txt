Now ain't nobody fucking with the mastermind 
 I'm like Einstein, a hundred and fifty times magnified 
 Nikola Tesla, John von Neumann 
 All wrapped up in the body in one human 
 I rhyme the tightest, shine the brightest 
 I blind the optic fibres in anybody's iris 
 When it comes to rapping, I'll smash your ass 
 Whether you Latin, Black or Anglo-Saxon 
 I'll smack you with a backhand 
 That crack your back like chiropractors after looking at your catscan 
 In between albums, I've become a masked man like Batman 
 And stalk my own rap fans 
 I'm like a madman fighting a war 
 Throwing lightning rods, swinging lightning swords 
 Blow you away with a force that'll leave your body lost 
 Gone, nothing to mourn, nothing to do a autopsy on 
 I rock till I can't rock no more 
 Till I can't get no motherfucking props no more 
 Till they boo me on stage when I'm out on tour 
 Till 2000 B.C. ain't hot no more 
 I'm a dragon wit the head of a lion, jaws be like saws grinding 
 Claws rip through walls of cast iron 
 I slap fire outta hoodlum, pull out steel and start shooting 
 I clap iron like Duke Nukem 
 Try to attack Bis, you get your face stomped 
 Flatter than a compact disc with black Timbs 
 Flatter than a Yankee baseball cap rim 
 Flatter than the knife Jigga stabbed Un with
