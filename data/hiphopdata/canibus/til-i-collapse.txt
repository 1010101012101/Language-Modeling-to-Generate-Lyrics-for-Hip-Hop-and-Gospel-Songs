(Canibus) 
 Underground manure rap from the sewer rat 
 Upload me a beat, I vocal it and shoot it back 
 Captured tagged released the microphone Beast from the East 
 Canibus clones running through the street 
 Over Marco Polo beats I black out the Baa Baa Black Sheep 
 Sweet sixteen, customised heat 
 Speak, spit over the beat, it shouldn't take long 
 Look at me, this is what the underground means 
 You enter the room, you smell your own doom 
 What you gonna do when you meet an emcee just like you 
 This is what is to be expected with no direction 
 A probe was sent to get an answer for a question in a scripted sentence 
 Placed over the beat, the way it was presented 
 Not to mention what ever I recommended before the verse ended 
 This is so strange, I congregate in a place for no names 
 Worth their own weight in gold in the game 
 (Canibus) 
 If this is not the best, it is slightly less 
 Lord Finesse in the flesh spit a bar per request 
 I feel as if everything I've learned 
 Has made be obsolete before I could even say one word 
 What I said it not what you heard or what you thought you observed 
 The vision is getting blurred but you have to be sure 
 Spin into a turn, go over the curb 
 Explode below over the earth, tossed from the vehicle, rolling in the dirt 
 You are hurt, the paramedics didn't notice you first 
 You weep from thirst, blood gush from the whole in your shirt 
 What does it feel like to be a rap legend 
 That is never mentioned, no matter what he has invented? 
 What is his inventions? He built a place where the beats could be tested 
 Captured, tagged, released, re-edited 
 Take your medicine, Canibus sedatives, let it live 
 I think the other beat came off better kid
