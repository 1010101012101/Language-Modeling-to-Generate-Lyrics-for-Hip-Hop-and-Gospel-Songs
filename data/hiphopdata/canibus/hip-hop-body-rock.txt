(Chorus x2: Canibus) 
 Hip Hop, do that body rock 
 Jam on it, Keep smoking 
 Hip Hop do, that body rock 
 I been gone for a while, but I'm still in style 
 Hah 
 (Canibus) 
 Yeah, c'mon now, get on down 
 Can-I-Bus, back with the Hip Hop sound 
 Twenty-years deep in this culture, compulsive 
 Every day, this was the dream that I woke with 
 Outside chilling, B-Boy's spinning 
 Pretending not to notice the supreme-choice women 
 I rep the Rude Boy Natty Dread posse 
 And the dirty balhead Zombie's behind me 
 Turn the lights up, pick the mic up 
 Get them hyped up, looking for the right cut 
 I don't like much, but I love to bust 
 At the crowd 'cause they love the rush 
 The markings on my arm was drawn 
 They symbolize the art of Hip Hop in it's rawest form 
 We can take it to the stage like we going to war 
 Low crawling through the crowd we perform on tour 
 Come correct with the rhyme, they remember the flow 
 I was 'Gone Till November', six December's ago 
 So 
 (Canibus) 
 Every day is a piece of eternity that we control 
 That's why Rap music feeds the soul 
 DJ drop needle, I shock people 
 There's a mic doc in the house and he's not legal 
 Canibus just entered the building y'all 
 If you looking for the illest star, feel me y'all 
 I get a call, slide through Diego 
 Hit the Bay off, with something less than a day old 
 Here's a hot one for you to hold 
 The super-emcee SuperBowl, winner takes all 
 The 'Fahrenheit 9/11' rhyme weapon 
 The underground give me credit when I'm sound checking 
 I feel like it's now or never 
 The rhymes stay clever when the wisdom-teeth grind together 
 Go to sleep, I can't go to sleep unless I write something 
 Then stay awake, I can't stay awake unless I recite something 
 I can't recite something without tight substance 
 When I'm busting, I leave motherfucking mics busted 
 *20 seconds of beat playin*
