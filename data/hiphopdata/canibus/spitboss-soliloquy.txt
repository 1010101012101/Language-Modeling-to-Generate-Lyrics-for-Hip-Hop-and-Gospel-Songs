(Intro: 8Bars) 
 When I say "Can-I" you say "Bus" 
 "Can-I"..."BUS", "Can-I"..."BUS" 
 When I say "Can-I" you say "Bus" 
 "Can-I"..."BUS", "Can-I"..."BUS" 
 Yo, he who signals the truth 
 It's Madd Cold, 8Bars and Rip the Jacker in the booth 
 It's time to make history, Cousin 
 (Madd Cold) 
 Ascended Masters, seventh dimensional plane 
 Ishmael's blood pumps to my pen from my veins 
 Bis, Bars and Cold have entered from the heavens to reign 
 Step to us, we'll send you to another level of PAIN! 
 (Canibus) 
 Hallowed be thy name 
 SpitBoss and Notre Dame 
 (Fades in) King King King Solomon and Saint Germaine 
 Meditate and say names 
 Meditate and say the names 
 (Canibus) 
 Words from the gallow, your metaphor merchant accountant 
 Allergic to pollen, the Earth is an island 
 We live divided so the workers are violent 
 They don't prefer to be silent, they deserve to be admonished and I realize it 
 They have the knowledge, but for now I'm the pilot 
 I designed it, I'll fly it, stand back and be quiet 
 I bust my sixteen by using a touchscreen 
 My brother screams, "Bis, calm down it's just dreams!" 
 I'll take your beat CD and throw it on the floor 
 You gave me the same beat you already gave me before 
 Soaked eyes in menthol, play pinball 
 Place the ball-point to the back of the skull, then pull 
 You think you a gangster? You live in New Hampshire 
 With dancers and hamsters and wanksters from Kansas 
 The features are money, the way they act, 
 Believe me they don't love me, but I still get busy buddy 
 Leave you bloody and ugly, pissy and drunky 
 In a Pakistani prison with Rushdie, standing there in ya undies 
 I transform into a beast with wide teeth 
 You transform into Tyrese, so why speak? 
 Don't lie to me, this is called lyrical sodomy 
 To survive I had to lay your dead body on top of me 
 I bomb atomically, Lexicography properties from high monasteries 
 Can't describe how I be dropping these odysseys 
 Lyrically perform cartography 
 There is no stopping me, you might as well rock with me 
 Don't ever stop the beat, don't ever stop trying to rhyme 
 Don't ever think that you can spit a verse better than mine 
 Got that? Good. I ain't got nothing to sign 
 I just do what I do all the time and bust the rhymes 
 The beat is crazy and it's about time 
 These emcees are also one of a kind 
 (Madd Cold) 
 BOOM! 
 Nuclear bomb and it's in your facility 
 Y'all can not handle the sick bar ability 
 Time for battle is now, get war artillery 
 And then please recite the SpitBoss Soliloquy 
 (8Bars) 
 This right here, is Hip Hop 
 So fuck you, we won't stop 
 We told you, we won't die 
 From the ground, we shall rise 
 (Verse 2: 8Bars) 
 Now just for the record kid 
 Yes, I am a force to be reckoned with 
 Niggas left a void, so yes I will be stepping in 
 Takeover is needed, the reign of 8 is beckoning 
 It's never too late to get schooled on raps ______ 
 Keeping rap alive with every page of my scriptures 
 My words is Al Sharptons, I'm burying niggas 
 From the valley of the shadow where they raise us to be killas 
 My instinct helps me to weed out my soon to be victims 
 It's Canibus and Fallen Sun 
 With verses so high above you clowns 
 That I could battle God like "Yo you took the wrong bun (?)" 
 That's real talk, we spank niggas get 'em all shook 
 You're done, like reppin' the wrong click in the wrong slum 
 Don't worry about mine, I was destined to do this 
 I'm a SpitBoss, you ain't even gathering mucus 
 Real recognize real, ain't no way to confuse it 
 Any imposters might find it abusive 
 Say hello to raps Neo 
 I'm bound to show 'em everything they said about my future's wrong 
 I was surrounded by Miss Cleos 
 A fighting man, I couldn't stay drowning in rock (?) zero 
 Was poised to take shit over since I looked through that peephole 
 On the door to success, so we bound to get hurled 
 Into the future man, we're _______ in a valley of girls 
 Some say to aim for the sky and all your plans will unfurl 
 But why see the sky is the limit when I'm out of this world 
 (Madd Cold) 
 Nuclear bomb and it's in your facility 
 Y'all cannot handle the sick raw ability 
 Time for battle is now, get more artillery 
 Then please recite the spitboss soliloquy 
 This right here, is hip-hop 
 So fuck you, we won't stop 
 We told you, we won't die 
 From the ground, we shall rise 
 (8Bars) 
 This right here, is Hip Hop 
 So fuck you, we won't stop 
 We told you, we won't die 
 From the ground, we shall rise 
 (Verse 3: Madd Cold) 
 I arrive on the scene the barkleys are blue 
 The swagger of Marcy is proof your army is through 
 I will violently annihilate your lying regime 
 Freedom is what I will die for, ride for the fallen 
 Iraq to Palestine inscribed in rhyme on my sleeve 
 Fly with the speed/of a high peregrine 
 Falcon the talons will tear your scalp as I fly through your team 
 Madd Cold, you gotta be out of your mind if you think I would cry when you bleed 
 I am the meanest alive since the rising of phoenix 
 Combined with the vibrance of Issac, Muhammad, and Jesus 
 Align it the fire of demons and that is what I am Azaziah is an undeniable beast 
 You would swear I was paraplegic the way I step on the track's an irreconcilable FEET 
 Sickly over your head like the toxins of a condom's texture 
 You are not relentless, you are spineless, mindless and meek 
 Scaling the mountain, you've been climbing for weeks 
 You finally reach the top and you're type scared 
 It is like a cokehead's worst nightmare 'cause at the end of the line it is me 
 Push you off with Brooklyn force the mountainside will silence screams 
 Trying to attain the ire of Poseidon spit sublime like his trident and get divine as the deep 
 Al-Haqq is the name to you Zionist freaks 
 Your system is finished and I am the virus prescribed by the Highest 
 It was God that designed me to breach 
 (Madd Cold) 
 Nuclear bomb and it's in your vicinity 
 Y'all can not handle the sick bar ability 
 Time for battle is now, war artillery 
 And then please recite the SpitBoss Soliloquy 
 (8Bars) 
 This right here, is Hip Hop 
 So fuck you, we won't stop 
 We told you, we won't die 
 From the ground, we shall rise
