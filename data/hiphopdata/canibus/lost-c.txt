 Yo, Yo, Yo 
 Now when you see that big-ass C, you know I'm coming through 
 And when you know I'm coming through, you know what I'ma do 
 I never said that battling me would be impossible 
 I just think it's highly mother fucking improbable 
 You talking to a nigga that can split molecules to subatomic particles 
 Strong enough to stop a bull 
 Body-slam two ox's, drop a mule 
 Urinating rocket fuel, freestyling over gospel tunes 
 Rhymes by the thousands, rhymes for hours 
 I could kick a rhyme longer than your whole album 
 The kick boxer, beating the shit out niggas proper 
 I beat them till they holler, beat them till the cops come 
 Beating niggas till they have seizures, beat them till they start screaming 
 Like fax machines when they start receiving 
 Beat them till my own hands start bleeding 
 Beat them till they lungs stop breathing and they heart stop beating 
 From twelve A.M. to twelve P.M. in the evening 
 With three fifteen minute breaks in between them 
 Good Jesus, that's a real West-Indian beating 
 That's what you get for fucking with this lyrical demon 
 My bloodstream's been, contaminated for eons 
 I got cast out of Heaven for treason 
 Got cast out of the Garden of Eden for letting the reptilian beast in 
 Got locked up for a D.U.I. and speeding 
 A whole legion of half-decent emcees get'll released when 
 They spit a hundred bars for they freedom 
 See I'm much too nice to compete with 
 Too nice to flow over beats with, too nice to hold a M-I-C with 
 Off some Diesel-Hercules shit, I cold flip 
 And start to punch trees till they leafless 
 Inhale with two real deep breaths, hold my breath 
 Till the whole planet suffocates and then release it

 Yo 
 You ain't as cold as us, or as bold as us 
 When you get thrown to the wolves, you get thrown to us 
 'Cause we rolling rough, when the soldiers rush 
 Either you roll wit us, or get blown to dust 
 You ain't as cold as us, or as bold as us 
 When we in the war zone, we got the chrome with us 
 'Cause we rolling rough, when the soldiers rush 
 Either you roll wit us, or get blown to dust 
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, Yo 
 Now for the last couple of months, things been real quiet 
 'Cause I ain't heard shit worth buying 
 I'm bout to show you niggas how I'm driven 
 The drive comes from my lyrics, and my lyrics come from my inner spirit 
 Vibrating and spinning, faster than twelve cylinder engines 
 With nitrogen in them, faster than F-1 McLaren pistons 
 Fast enough to give your brain an aneurysm 
 'Cause you niggas is slower than fat bitches metabolism 
 The way I rip apart the competition when I be spitting 
 The name Canibus might as well be Cannibalism 
 Show me a man that can't feel him 
 I'll show you a man that'll grab him by the neck and put his head to the fan on the ceiling 
 Suffer real banned from television shit 
 Drop him off the roof of a building and let the news film him 
 I hop in front of the cameras and tell them how I'm feeling 
 I'll tell them how I feel that Hip Hop, should deal with it 
 Tell them how I'm tired of the state Rap is in 
 Ninety percent of the shit that rappers kick is subject matter less 
 Not original, but blasphemous, just a bunch of the same characters 
 Shooting the same videos, it's embarrassing 
 Using the same formulas to have a hit 
 Using the same actors and actresses, same shit different laxative 
 Face it nigga you wack as shit I'm snatching your mic 
 I make you run for your life, chill during the daylight 
 To track you at night, my global position is satellite 
 Got a infrared lens to detect your body's Fahrenheit 
 Wherever you go, I track you through hail, sleet, or snow 
 I track you till your ceasar grows into a afro 
 Until you plaid them into cornrows 
 Track you till your shoe soles develop holes and you get corns on your toes 
 Till your teeth develop halitosis 
 But you been going so long without deodorant you don't even notice 
 Mother fucker 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 You ain't as cold as us, or as bold as us 
 When you get thrown to the wolves, you get thrown to us 
 'Cause we rolling rough, when the soldiers rush 
 Either you roll wit us, or get blown to dust 
 You ain't as cold as us, or as bold as us 
 When we in the war zone, we got the chrome with us 
 'Cause we rolling rough, when the soldiers rush 
 Either you roll wit us, or get blown to dust 
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust 
 You ain't as cold as us, or as bold as us 
 When you get thrown to the wolves, you get thrown to us 
 'Cause we rolling rough, when the soldiers rush 
 Either you roll wit us, or get blown to dust 
 You ain't as cold as us, or as bold as us 
 When we in the war zone, we got the chrome with us 
 'Cause we rolling rough, when the soldiers rush 
 Either you roll wit us, or get blown to dust 
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
