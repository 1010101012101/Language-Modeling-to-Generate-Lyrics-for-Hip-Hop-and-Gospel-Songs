(Keith Murray) 
 Let me see ya hands 
 We network power moves 
 Keith Murray, Canibus 
 Don't make your gun go click click boom 
 Create a whole genre 
 The world ain't safe, there's no tomorrow 
 Nigga, this is torsion field 
 Attack the jugular, overkill 
 Keith Murray and Canibus, what's the meaning? 
 The hardcore niggas in the streets is fiending 
 Make you play hide and go seek with your demons 
 Ranting, raving, hollering, screaming 
 Keith Murray, LOD 
 Oh my god 
 Keith Murray, Canibus, so damn hard 
 We make Them Reminisce Over You UnderGodz 
 You can meet you maker 
 Step into my face and you is a faker 
 Hater, I'll see you later 
 I'll put you in an incubator 
 You'll be dead and me and Canibus will be in Jamaica 
 (Canibus) 
 In Jamaica 
 (In Jamaican accent) 
 Guns shots up on ya, come in like a big pussy don't you 
 Where I'm gon' dump ya 
 (End of accent) 
 Expert flow Germaine, broad head, four-hundred grain 
 I was entertained, I saw a hundred slain 
 Deranged finder ranger reminder, paint the target 
 Walk up to your forehead and paint across it 
 Revisit that, give me a minute to re-edit the rap 
 Fuck that, I'll put my fist in your trap 
 Nigga wanna spit, we spat, that's that 
 What the fuck you looking back for it's the last lap 
 Got me in a hassle, nigga acting like he wanna wrassle 
 Smack DVD gun battle 
 Torsion field twist steel blow the air back off wheel 
 You are dragged from the car and killed 
 Ski mask face, no trace, rap sound like rape 
 We gesticulate like apes on mixtapes 
 This high fidelity, fuck what they telling me 
 No body address the beat like Canibus and Keith Murray 
 Raw to the floor, raw like 'Reservoir Dogs' 
 UnderGodz coming with that yes yes y'all 
 (Keith Murray) 
 Ayo the Burnout Brothers, we the truth 
 I spit that shit to make me run out the booth 
 I got to say peace to my uncle Snoop 
 We smoke chronic leaves into a poof 
 And everybody knows we some lyrical fools 
 When they guess the metaphors they be like ooh 
 Me and Canibus can go for days 
 And linger in the mind like displaced rage 
 We make that hardcore tailor made 
 That make niggas put your face on the front page 
 (Outro: Keith Murray) 
 You motherfuckers, you can't compete 
 You know you don't wanna go man for man power on the streets 
 It's Bis and Keith, yeah, bring it on 
 Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on 
 Ha, yeah, we set fire to the world 
 And everybody got to resort to the beach, ha 
 Yo, what you gonna do when we trap you on the sand? Ha 
 It's the grandsons of the son of man 
 Of the sickest sickest sickest Son of Sam 
 Shoutout to Killah Priest 
 And them hardcore niggas that run the streets...
