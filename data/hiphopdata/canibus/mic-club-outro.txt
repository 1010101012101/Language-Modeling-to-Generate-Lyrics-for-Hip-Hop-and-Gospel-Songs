 This is a favourite short saying of mine 
 Two famous lines, time flies 
 Especially when you listen to rhymes 
 Words become time and time is disguised 
 Around the world in eighty seconds through a sentence 
 Experience is the mother of all adventure 
 Who knows the unknown? Where will you end up? 
 Question yourself, who, when and what? 
 I tell you this much, it's up to everyone of you 
 Learn from the past or the future will punish you 
 Power flows to those who remember 
 Memory comes from words, words come from letters 
 This is Mic Club's primary premise 
 We tell history, we don't let history tell us, Mic Club

 I think I write because it is the only thing I know how to 
 Do very, and it's my way of contributing to the betterment 
 Of the planet and to my community
