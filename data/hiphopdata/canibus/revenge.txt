I choke ghosts from my past with a rope made of ether 9 gas 
 Then I let the evil times pass 
 Its clear and only natural, that niggaz come at you to trap you 
 But they will put your assassin in shackles 
 If you seek revenge, dig many graves 
 'Cause you will be betrayed a different number of ways 
 Many days are spent, plotting and planning your revenge 
 But let me tell you how it's gon' end son 
 Cold and lonely, dying, slowly 
 Listening to oldies, but ain't got no homies 
 Predatorial instincts, territorial animistics 
 Some spirits are dark and twisted 
 We all rise and decline above or below that line 
 And continue to either climb or dive 
 Kill or be collective mind back at the hive 
 Sting you a million times just for actin' all shy 
 Get booted up, move up, Fallujah Sharpshooter 
 Cougars chasin' Pumas, justice is juice and guts 
 The mortar shells loosen you up 
 You so stiff you stuck, shut the ____ 'fore I put you in the trunk 
 Fifty minutes of funk, I lock, load and dump 
 Get some, that's how you get revenge you lil' punk 
 But revenge is not what Canibus want 
 Canibus love hip-hop, Canibus's done
