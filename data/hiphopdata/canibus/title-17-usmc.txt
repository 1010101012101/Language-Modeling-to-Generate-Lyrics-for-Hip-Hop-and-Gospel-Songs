I'm in a meeting with the Surgeon General of written texts 
 The battery of one thousand psychological tests 
 I am exhausted and stressed but I continue to press 
 She asked me if I'm the best, I signed languaged back YES 
 Spell words wrong while writing down rhymes nowadays 
 My hairs are beginning to grey, that's why I'ma shave 
 The sky dark purple, low crawl through the wormhole 
 Took me back to 1998 at Universal 
 2008 I'm eternal, 
 You know I'm still nice with the verbals and I ain't even heard you 
 Your views, your virtues, what you gonna do 
 When Martial Law curfews lock down your Rock Band Rehearsal? 
 Got Ground Zero asthma cancer 
 Buried on the Moon as the top Hip Hop Commander 
 After talking to Paul Laffoley, he spoke about perigee and apogee 
 Something that I understood naturally 
 The mindscape, the other atmosphere is my space 
 But in my case, I seem trapped by the rhymes that I make 
 Canibus code for a data tabulated below 
 It's the end of the World you know, glad you made it to the show 
 According to Title 17 USC 
 Section 107, Canibus is just an MC 
 I'm a Reggae turned rap translator from Jamaica 
 You a hater with that white boy haji behaviour 
 You could say what you say, but, my catalogue greater 
 Everything you heard before with more layers 
 Poet Laureate V, why didn't they accept me? 
 If I remember correctly, lets see 
 The "C" of Tranquility, the mind will ascend 
 The audio will blend into multiples of ten 
 The lies we have been told really are the truth 
 So together we will all learn again what we knew 
 Proud to have come so far, spit another bar 
 The carousel issue continues to revolve unresolved 
 Take my hand Ripper Grand Wizard chain of command 
 Take this torch to another land, tell them who I am 
 The riot squad robot look like Robocop photoshopped 
 Heckler and Koch, Semi-auto stock 
 I speak into the mic, leaves fall off the "Tree of life" 
 But next Fall I'ma see if you nice.
