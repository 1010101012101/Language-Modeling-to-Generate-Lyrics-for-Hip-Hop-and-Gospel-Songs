"Hit you so hard my hand breaks and my shoulder dislocates" 
 (Chino XL) 
 I murder a sixteen to the point that it's embarrassing 
 Hide a grenade in my jeans, douse the booth in kerosine 
 Shatter your heart's main vein pipe 
 Insane at night I might have your career disappear in plain sight 
 Throw you off the top of a church, stab you with a steeple 
 I'm bloodying punchlines like I assaulted a hundred zebras 
 None believers in the lair with Jesus' haters 
 To save it, they're afraid since my native halo in the cradle 
 Became a famous behemoth misbehaving angel 
 Insane but able with razors scraping your face through ya neighbours naval 
 A fatal fable, from Satan's table with an unstable brain cable 
 I'm hateful, blame it on being bi-racial 
 I'm psychologically an anomaly, should be given formal apologies 
 Honestly, a human oddity 
 A commodity, godly when raven spitting his blood spilling 
 Chino so stuck up, gotta peel me off the fucking ceiling 
 I'm bringing so much beef it'll make a Hindu kneel 
 So hard to kill you, heart's _____, beat you till you partial gristle tissue 
 Too fast for a photo, I slash the rapper who would be homo 
 Leave them just skull and crosses like Jack Ass' movie logo 
 Burn down your fucking apartment, barricade the fire escape 
 What I spit is __, you make nightmares try to stay awake 
 Never had a fly quote, nigga you and I know 
 The best thing you'll ever write is a suicide note 
 (Canibus) 
 Canibus and Chino XL, rebels from Hell 
 He's a giant I'm a stinger missile toting keebler elf 
 Keep to myself strategic for stealth 
 If I don't need it I leave it believe it I kept it greasy for more than 60 seasons, 
 Tear the target to pieces reload and repeat it 
 I got a billion bars but I ain't got the time to release it 
 And you ain't got the time to listen to it 
 Hitman music, blow a hole through your head and piss through it 
 'Cause you ain't fit to do this 
 He vocalled it first I vocalled it second, 
 Lyrics get murdered, we move in and do the forensics 
 Shut down your studio sessions DNA analysis and collections 
 'Cause Mic checking is a Rippers Jurisdiction 
 I'm a telepathic detective, 
 Blast you with a non-kinetic weapon back to the essence beyond the Outer Limits, 
 Wicked and wretched send you a message blow your ass out to the desert 
 Motherfucker's prepare for the unexpected 
 We meet, symbolic technique anabolic release 
 Any MC gets weak when he knows he's dead meat 
 If I strike you'll be red for weeks 
 You might check in with a beast that'll tan you like the Mexican heat 
 The steps to my monastery are steep 
 If you still feeling froggy when we get to the top then lets leap 
 Inhale the hydrogen mist, then try to get hyper than Bis 
 It can't get no hyper than this 
 Lyrical Law hands on jet turbo fans on 
 Aviators are drawn into a criss-cross sand launch 
 Turn starboard but still can't dodge, 
 Bang hard S.O.S call command coms concentrate can't talk 
 Not out of the woods yet, you can't thank God, 
 The red baron's hair is as long as Susan Saradon 
 War Hawks and red hawks launch, out the underground airforce 
 You bail out like Amelia Earhart 
 SEER training is for naught 
 I taught you before I finish my Cigar, you a Prisoner of Lyrical Law 
 Yeah, now I'ma seal the whole area off, 
 What the fuck you thought? Ain't nobody scaring me off, aight 
 Niggas be rhyming like they lazy and soft 
 Get ate by the SpitBoss this is Lyrical Law, yeah 
 Niggas be rhyming like the lazy and soft 
 Then get ate by a SpitBoss this is Lyrical Law 
 Fuck you!
