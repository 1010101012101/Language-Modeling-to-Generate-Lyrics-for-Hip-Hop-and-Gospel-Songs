No longer doing this shit for TV 
 I ain't rich but I'm good 
 I'm the same reason they move in them bulletproof trucks 
 (Break: Canibus) 
 All I do is grab the pen 
 (Canibus) 
 Rap Bread and Butter, broken Language the hustler 
 Starboard rudder, the Coast Guard Cutter 
 I'm the studio night-owl, stress give me white eyebrows 
 Who the fuck I got to fight with now? 
 Yeah, conspicuous characters creep through America 
 With a killer chemical in a canister called Canibus 
 Crazy as crystal communicate correct signal 
 They call it criminal, I call it lyrical 
 Call the Commissioner I'm going to crucify the Christian Caligula 
 Like they crucified M.C. Christopher 
 I cast the Canibus symbol in the crowd 
 If there's beef on the ground, I'm going to carve the cow 
 Now, smuggle contraband through the canal 
 I check my clip on my chamber, sharpshooter style 
 La Costa Nostra, deep like Deepak Chopra 
 I kick your door down in loafers 
 .45 in the holster, AK in the baby stroller 
 Babies with baking soda, my lady in the Rover 
 A midget with dreadlocks down to his toes 
 With flows I expose what nobody knows
