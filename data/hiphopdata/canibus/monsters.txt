(Chorus x4: Canibus) 
 Worlds to conquer, resources to plunder 
 I am what you made me, a motherfucking monster 
 Canibus and Vinnie Paz, Monsters 
 (Canibus) 
 Solitude in the life of a Ripper is quite bitter 
 I ain't no Social Network nigga, fuck Twitter 
 If I can't be lyrical, I get miserable 
 You don't want me to be miserable, so let me go 
 Or detain me, entertain me, talk to me frankly 
 This is how you thank me, I'm one of the good guys thankfully 
 Good equals Evil, how can it be? 
 How can it be? See? 
 I am exactly the way I was made 
 Even when I change lyrical content still bangs 
 Can't wait to hear what you spit over this 
 The beat flatline I rhyme Jedi Mind Tricks 
 Vinnie Paz, Canibus, philanthropist 
 Pass us the cannabis for the assist, I hold my breath 
 Then I burn this shit down from the ground to the roof 
 All ground troops against one Canibus nuke 
 Next time you regroup, bring a chemical suit 
 'Cause I don't wanna get vegetable soup puke on my boots 
 The wave that interpermiates time will flatline 
 Radiantly we will be inside that mind 
 Jedi Mind third eye will identify the force that binds 
 Force of the rhymes will turn on solar signs 
 Sun spot spitting sunshine, wild like Busta Rhymes 
 Give me the track, if I touch it it mines 
 Duct tape you to the table, hook you up to the jump cables 
 Remember what I told you about Ezazu 
 Worlds to conquer, resources to plunder 
 I am what you made me, a motherfucking monster
