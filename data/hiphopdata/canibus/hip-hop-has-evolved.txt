(Intro: Canibus) 
 The wait is over 
 You wanna be a Boss I'ma show ya 
 It's almost time 
 For the Brotherhood to shine 
 For any and all who wanna rhyme 
 We invite emcees to SpitBoss.com 
 The wait is over 
 Whoever wanna be a Boss I'ma show ya 
 It's almost time 
 For any and all who wanna rhyme 
 January 2009 
 We invite emcees to SpitBoss.com 
 The wait is over, it's almost time 
 For the Brotherhood to shine 
 For any and all who wanna rhyme 
 We invite emcees to SpitBoss.com 
 (Canibus) 
 I've battled emcees for ten years straight 
 Captain Cold Crush been buff since '88 
 My dogs rush the gate, the lockjaw crush your face 
 You tried to skin graft but can't replace 
 10,000 Bars nobody can keep that pace 
 I wrote it in layers, nobody can run that race 
 Or counteract my Sharpshooter attack 
 Superhuman rap, you wack, you face my executioner's axe 
 My utility belts stack with Pro Tools and tracks 
 The whole food fat, boom back boo is back 
 Out of sight, out of mind, gotta write, gotta rhyme 
 Gotta grind, gotta get mine, I show you how to shine 
 SpitBoss.com is a shrine that was designed 
 To show them the coat of arms and the lines of the rhymes 
 Of a time form ticking with infinite bars spitten all different 
 Calling all Rippers with Lyrical Fitness 
 I'ma Spit Boss 
 You ready to be a horse, prove it 
 Spit Boss, Spit Boss, Spit Boss, Spit Boss 
 (Outro: Canibus) 
 Box the bells *echoes* 
 Box the bells *echoes* 
 This for Hip Hop, who the fuck wanna Spit Box 
 Ten steps on your marks get set, draw flip locks 
 Spit for sixty seconds then stop, reset your wrist watch, 
 Spit Box, Spit Box, Spit Box, Spit Box 
 Box the bells
