(Killah Priest) 
 I hide my face like the Elephant Man, follow, you reach 
 Out of long black sleeves with skeleton hands 
 Touch rappers, watch them rot, they skin fall off 
 Boil in the pavement, on the cold boardwalks 
 Then I laugh like the Joker, while pissin' on 'em 
 Then put on my hood, wait on the next corner 
 The next victim, look at his face, with tears in my eyes 
 That crystalize and turn into stone, before they fall from my dome 
 Like an avalanche, the way I spit sound like an African chant 
 The Priest run through MC's like I'm trampelin' ants 
 Peep the form, it's a Vatican stance 
 The Pope Victor the first, the flow spit with a curse 
 The sicker the verse, the more bodies to stick in the dirt 
 Wait around, I'mma pick you a hearse 
 I like them long black ones, drive around while spinning on two wheels 
 It's whatever you feel, blue steel 
 On black day, silver clouds when the mack spray 
 Turn rappers back into clay 
 My mind's a museum filled with microphone exhibits 
 Of rhymes that I write, that look like pictures 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Aiyo, my technique is bezerk, bezerk, I'm better than y'all niggas 
 Pull ya fucking skin off like a T-shirt 
 We taught, no remorse, donate aborted rappers for skin cell research 
 I spit a few bars, and niggas is Fubar 
 You wouldn't ride on me if you was driving two cars, homey 
 The mind of Caesar Augustus, rocking a caesar 
 Eating a caesar salad in August 
 Plus I'm allustrious, I've been with the boys 
 Born and raised in L.A. by monster Co-D's 
 Slowly chose the dark side for ice cold forties 
 Like Obi-Wan Kenobi with an iced out Rollie 
 And might fuck a white bitch, don't get it fucked up 
 Love black chicks, but they don't like to suck nuts 
 So tell me what the hell am I suppose to do 
 It's like sipping siz-urp, in youth and I'm suppose to screw 
 Talk slimey like Oprah, people shit backwards 
 Just to make Harpo out of Oprah 
 Ras spit sicker than most groups put together 
 'Cause y'all put together, I put foot to leather 
 And walk over dead bodies, like Rise of the Machines 
 Don't be surprised, nigga, it's Idi Amin 
 Rappers get 'ate' up, like that number on Kobe's jersey 
 God dammit it, I pop that swervy 
 (Canibus) 
 Canibus, the only M.C. on Earth, 
 That did geophysical research, about the new rebirth 
 The Sun turn the Earth, to rotisserie dirt 
 Listen 'fore you start dissing me first, this'll be worse 
 Twelve degree pole shift, displace the ocean 
 They send space probes in, they come back broken 
 Armageddon omen, Planet X inbound 
 That rapidly approaching, none of us are chosen 
 Field manual, two zero dash four six 
 Your life's getting away, you better run for it 
 Population reduction, mass destruction 
 The reset button is coming and some of us love it 
 The return of Niburu, we will prepare you 
 Stay away from the media, they will scare you 
 Rappers respect beef, tactics and technique 
 I'mma show you how the best compete, let's peep 
 My verse on the mic, is a surgical strike 
 Of herbal delight with no personal life 
 Live Saturday Night, sacrifice, batter the mic 
 Jab to the left, jab to the right 
 (Kurupt) 
 I'm the scripture sculpture, volcanic 
 You ignoramous, I'm the future 
 Volcanic vulture, proverb 
 I fire words, test this cannon 
 All opponents, poetry Leonist 
 Spartan, you just can't sink me 
 Shots, Hell's Kitchen, to Hellsinki 
 Since I was born, it's all about roaming 
 Since the Roman wars, I've been Caesar 
 Master seizures, master of diseases 
 Throughout the legions, temperature's beyond degrees 
 Terrifying like Saddam allegiance 
 Ingenius, fuck ya, I don't wanna have to bust ya open 
 But I think you're looking too closely 
 And I don't wanna have to bust ya eyes, fuck it 
 Fuck your eyes, fuck your momma, fuck the drama 
 Who needs it, who like it, who bleeds it 
 Who think it, who smoke it, who drink it 
 Mothafucka, I'mma start shrinking 
 Each and every one of you niggas, bitches particles 
 You walk in and get read like articles 
 Shredding, I'mma teach all of y'all 
 How to start poetry, beheading, of the headless Horsemen, nigga 
 Read the perscription, try it once, instantaneous addiction 
 If you ever wanna see me 
 H-O-R-S-E-M-E-N, nigga, nigga, nigga
