I was aiming with the red dot 
 Waiting for the order to take the head shot 
 Communications was unstable 
 This is Shadow Gallery strategy, battle me for an infinite salary 
 You couldn't pick a more impossible fantasy 
 Serious satellite savagery, psychics sit down to examine me 
 They don't believe the planet is my family 
 My psyche hyper than Hyphy, high speed Tai Chi like me 
 Exercising will yield better rhyming like me 
 Back to my center, I raise ten degrees in temperature 
 I show you what predators infra-red is for 
 Remember, remember the 5th of Forever 
 Fear is a weapon, and freedom is just a set up 
 Politicians fess up to how badly the fuck they messed up 
 More or less, their question is, guess what? 
 Guess what's next? Physical and visual confirmation 
 Of the subject to get justice but not just yet 
 I am no more than nothing, a nameless nobody saying something 
 About what I can clearly see coming 
 I took precise pictures of the hellish void on celluloid 
 With a Polaroid but it was destroyed 
 I'm complacent of my creature comforts 
 One verse from me is a Sunburst that make dust of the Earth 
 Create a bunch of words and bend the curve of how they are heard 
 You must unlearn! Boombox, boombox, boombox
