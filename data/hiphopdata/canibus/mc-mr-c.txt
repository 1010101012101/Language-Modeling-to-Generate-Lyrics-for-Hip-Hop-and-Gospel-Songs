Aiyo, I stand in the observatory 
 My staff stands before me with wordless glory, they adore me 
 Minutes are not recorded, hours are converted to orbits 
 With exabyte tape storage 
 Listen, Canibus one way trip 
 Mission M16, the Eagle Nebular star system 
 My rap refracts the rhythm 
 The beats stays behind this line until I give them permission 
 Forever aesthetic, the credits should go to Henrietta Leavitt 
 The stars she's measured, don't forget it 
 She left me a message 
 She told me my dark energy was energetic and I must respect it 
 She told me the Universe was pregnant and I was the father 
 Shit that's a whole lot to swallow 
 My alien friends 
 Niobium titanium ranium copper oxide say it again 
 MC Mr C, we know who you're reputed to be 
 You get busy, how foolish of me 
 Metaphors by edict, leave Hip Hop speechless 
 I write it, they read it, they need it 'cause they believe it 
 My two inch reels are hermetically sealed 
 In a cabin below New York, post war built 
 Deep underground military base too 
 How's a dummy like you gonna ever know the truth? 
 They ask for proof 
 Saint Germaine praying, computer brain analysis, get in the booth then produce 
 Light from within touch the ring around the firing pin 
 The Universal Mind is wired in 
 A hundred grid bed nuclear motors 
 Weighing less than ten thousand pounds, operated by a thousand soldiers 
 Doors to the memoirs of metaphors 
 Leads you down a hall on that ends in a waterfall 
 Nobodies been there before, but they'd love to be 
 No video cameras, they would love to see 
 Just left the confession box my Lord 
 Excuse me while I go to HotWhores.org 
 Sitting there bored, graveyard shift at the morgue 
 Close circuit security level four 
 Hans Blix scripts the 'Beast from the East' conflict 
 'Cause nobody rhyme like this 
 My spit uranium, rich sexagenarian, 6-6 
 My cranium is an aquarium with fish 
 Combat risk, scale of one to ten, a six 
 My compact disc make your compact glitch 
 If you only have one wish, speak it, but first believe it 
 It's called metaphors by edict
