 (Intro: Canibus) 
 Genabis, 
 This is Genabis, 
 Remember this, 
 (Canibus) 
 In the beginning I discovered wordplay, 
 I experimented with some syllables from the first to the third day 
 On the fourth, I searched for the words to say, 
 How to compress complex verbiage in the least amount of space, 
 I was perfect at it and mastered the tactic, 
 On the fifth day I decided I would combine it with mathematics, 
 On the sixth day I became a fanatic, 
 And I couldn't kick the habit, I would just look in the mirror and practice, 
 On the seventh cycle I had to take the day off, 
 I was exhausted, I guessed my work would never pay off, 
 But if it happened to Him, it could happen to me, 
 And if it happened to me it was destined to be, 
 (Chorus x2: Canibus) 
 Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus, 
 There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch, 
 I read the Cosmos, what God wrote, predicted as much, 
 The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough, 
 (Canibus) 
 They backslide back to church and call the minister's bluff, 
 They'd rather remain unenlightened than listen to 'Bus, 
 I blew the fuck up, even though it was short and abrupt, 
 I was the first rapper to ever close orbit the Sun, 
 One small step for man, one huge step for mankind, 
 I am the Red Giant of rhymes, 
 Solar deflectors incinerate you whole in one second, 
 Flow is untested, those that I've threatened fold under pressure, 
 At one hundred and twenty beta cycles, 
 High volts ignite your eyeballs until you see the fire in front of you, 
 Optic cones and rods melt one at a time until you realize you're in Hell, 
 Rip the Jacker's not done with you, 
 I terrorize the rap community with impunity, 
 Blow you to pieces and move elusively through the debris, 
 What my enemies want to do to me is old news to me, 
 Those in pursuit of me will never get through to me, 
 (Chorus x2: Canibus) 
 Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus, 
 There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch, 
 I read the 'Cosmos', what God wrote, predicted as much, 
 The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough, 
 (Canibus) 
 First rapper to speak over beats dogmatically, 
 Mixed with Elizabethan drama and tragedy, 
 My motto is to dress casually and live lavishly, 
 Look at the Victorian tapestry and back at me, 
 Notice the post-Renaissance pictures I drew, 
 Hand sketched drawings of the deserts in Nazca, Peru, 
 The following audio propagates the possible truth, 
 To prove I'm the illest so the choice is not up to you, 
 See, the standard ideological definition of a rap model 
 Puts Canibus in scholarly periodicals, 
 The article is substantially impressive, 
 More than a message, a working thesis from several different perspectives, 
 The Rosetta Stone of sentences for rap music's tentative, 
 Entered Apprentices this is Genabis, 
 The Rosetta Stone of sentences for rap music's tentative, 
 Entered Apprentices this is Genabis,

 Yo, Genabis, Exobus, Levitibus, 
 There ain't a mic on this planet I'm restricted to touch, 
 I read the 'Cosmos', what God wrote predicted as much, 
 The inhabitants lack faith but resistance is tough,
