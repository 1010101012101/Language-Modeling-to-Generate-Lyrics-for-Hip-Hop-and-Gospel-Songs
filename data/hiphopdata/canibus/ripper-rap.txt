F my rhymes ever take to hind legs like a bear 
 And stand straight up in the air it's not fair 
 They tried to come at me with fear 
 I don't care- it's my destiny to be here 
 So I ain't scared 
 I seen the God King's son spit 'Beasts From the East' 
 And I couldn't spit that rhyme right now without freezing 
 Been underground for a thousand seasons 
 I'm underground for a thousand reasons 
 With ten thousand pieces 
 Dominate a whole entire species 
 Every piece is as strong as the first one 
 There is no weakness 
 Put the pieces together 
 Blame me for the reason you're better 
 When you come back tougher than leather 
 When the crescent moon glow 
 You know you gonna see him rise from the Mausoleum to the Hypogeum 
 Rise from the Mausoleum to the Hypogeum 
 Rise so high in the sky that all eyes can see him 
 The generous ____ example of who shouldn't see 
 But what wonders when the reliable will be allowed leave 
 If this sounds out of place, realize there's a reason for that 
 One reason could be that this is a trap 
 This is called Ripper Rap 
 Filosofey in fact 
 Show 'em where you at 
 Canibus got your back
