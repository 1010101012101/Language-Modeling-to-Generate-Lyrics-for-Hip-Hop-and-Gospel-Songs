(Canibus) 
 Yeah 
 I'm the ghost-rider with a face like a coalminer 
 On tracks, I'm more hyper than the Soul tiger 
 I pick the beat up on my back, my knee's crack 
 Mothafucka, I'm the sickest emcee to rap 
 I spit over Boom Bap, till tooth crack 
 Get a tooth-cap, for this new jack; a deuce, deuce, (tooth-cap) 
 Styling, cloak and dagger enter with violence 
 Savage, and silent, the world is an island 
 Tectonic plates gyrate, you trapped behind gate 
 With a five-eight primate 
 I elevate, that's why I sell what I make 
 My eyes chase light waves through time and space 
 Back on some mixtape shit; it's my fate 
 Y'all mothafuckas never gon' see my face 
 Get me on camera, erase time of dates 
 Inside the rhyme of space, the line is trace 
 What the fuck can be inside a diamond case 
 Besides the image of a baby coalminer's face?
