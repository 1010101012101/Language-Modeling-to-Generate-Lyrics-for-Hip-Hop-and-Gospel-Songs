How can I create the right sentence to help explain 
 How I feel when I wack emcee ride for Germaine? 
 Don't be a water brain, make you put your rhymes in quarantine 
 Put you up against War Machine 
 Sixty second rounds, keep your metaphors clean 
 Sleepwalk when I dream, spit Listerine green 
 The Microphone Fiend on the scene 
 Call on them, scream, he might break you off a sixteen 
 Laser beam lyrics coming at you with an altered speed 
 The Altered Beast don't pause for the beat 
 This is lyrical law, you will be among the first to compete 
 To run, walk or crawl over beats 
 The goal is too tall to reach, can't touch the Spit Boss' feet 
 You pole vault into a wall of defeat 
 I love Biggie 'cause I know what he means 
 When he told you, "It was all a dream"
