A ravenous man called Javelin Fangz (Oakland) 
 Dark days ahead, you never seen darker 
 Your mama gets kidnapped by the Chupacabra 
 Body drained of fluid, physically it's a stretch to do it 
 You wake up dead, wet, and wounded 
 One hundred parts per million per civilian 
 First inoculate the women and inoculate the children 
 I showcase the quotes that the alien wrote 
 The modern speech propulsion, chief consultant 
 In less time than it take to write these words 
 I scream out the end of the Earth but nobody heard 
 The low pressure suppressors, our light weight Cessna 
 Is a three-thousand pound feather we ride together 
 Canibus code, flow's tabulated below 
 The silo ceiling is low, we descend deeper though 
 My black goggles covered with bat guano 
 I hang from the ceiling and watch you, act hostile I pop you 
 Flesh wound look like marmalade mushrooms 
 And menstruation from a bloody wound, you will throw up soon 
 Tattoo absorb ink drawn from King Nimrod 
 The grimoires too large to think bars thank God 
 Vocal voodoo from King Cthulhu 
 How come you can't see me on the Youtube with Yusuf?
