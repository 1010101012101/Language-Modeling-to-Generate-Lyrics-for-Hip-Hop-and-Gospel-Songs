(Canibus) 
 First things first my friends, you should know nothing ends 
 It just goes to another place and happens again 
 You think the spirit in the body is gone, you are wrong 
 The spirit in the body is strong, look how we rep the song 
 G Rap, Canibus, Wisedome, it's like that 
 Hardcore rap but give me dap 
 G Rap, Canibus, Wisedome got that crack 
 Real Hip Hop, spit a rap 
 (Canibus) 
 I'm the old head, second prototype, Manolo on the mic 
 Dolomite, put his proto on the site 
 Kool G. Rap, Canibus, Wisedome give me dap 
 Till it sound like you cock semi back 
 That son of a bitch came from somebody's daughter 
 I want him caught before tomorrow and slaughtered 
 Motherfucker, I'm your father, G. Rap is the Godfather 
 Hip Hop's long lost father 
 Take the laser beam gun off the gun charger 
 Ghostbuster lama, go suck ya momma 
 Hold Hip Hop for hostage in the hottest box on the continent 
 The Ghana apartment complex 
 Out of Body Experience (OOBE), you can't be serious 
 The Reptilian will hiss till it sounds osedious 
 You that rapper form Gabba Gabba, you don't matter 
 You think you know the only answer to make a dope collabba 
 But you ain't the only master 
 *Can-Can-Can-I-Bus* 
 Yeah I used to be the nicest, going through a midlife mic crisis 
 Shit! The midwife forgot the diapers 
 Scorpion monkey spiders, you can't get off Nightmare Island 
 So I hope you enjoy your assignment 
 Everything is all private, for the most part all silent 
 Then explode into all violence 
 I'm tryna do something that doesn't amount to this
