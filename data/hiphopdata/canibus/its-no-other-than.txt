(Intro: Canibus) 
 It's no other than 
 It's no other than 
 No other than Canibus on the microphone 
 It's no other than 
 (Canibus) 
 No other than Canibus on the mic 
 This got to be the biggest track I ever touched in my life 
 Like the club can't breathe 'cause I'm clutching too tight 
 You 'bout to see a live Canibus eruption tonight 
 Thugs in black, bitches in white 
 I've got the olive green marine fatigues off for sensitive like 
 Took my time with the rhyme to build, I'm alive and well 
 Got that seven figure dollar smell 
 Take a chance baby, not Chanel 
 She come check me at the telly in a mini with the longest L 
 As soon as she got there, the block got cleared 
 The bitch volunteered brains, and she didn't stop there 
 Hot and fierce, she was not prepared 
 Pounding her upside-down from the top of the stairs 
 Till the pressure started popping her ears 
 She thought it would last forever but I told her I was dropping this year 
 (Canibus) 
 I can't stay long, I'm on my way to the bank 
 But while I'm here I'd like to thank 
 Canibus supporters, they knew the time 
 Ask them, "Whose the nigga with the dopest rhymes?" 
 Yo, bring it back one more time 
 And ask them, "Whose the nigga with the dopest rhymes?" 
 I bus' lines like public transportation 
 The rhymes always on time when I say shit 
 I'll give you vertigo, murder the flow 
 My voice travel like that smell when they burning the 'dro 
 On the tour bus they searching the coach 
 In the airport they searching my coat, they say they searching for dope 
 'Legal Drug Money' stickers on the back of my bag 
 The only artefact from my past that I still have 
 I'm a brand new man, with a brand new plan 
 Talking to bitches nude-tanning in the Cancun sands 
 (Canibus) 
 I play the nine, you play the target 
 You all know my name so I guess I'll just start this 
 I'm so swift and that's a natural fact 
 I'm like Rip, I'll mark a 'C' on your back 
 Yo, follow me into a solo, to get the flow 
 That you can picture like a photo 
 They say I'm shallow, I never learned to swim 
 But they mention my name 'cause I got the urge to win 
 Tell me who's your weed man, how you smoke so good? 
 You're a superstar baby, why you still in the hood? 
 Damn, I hate to brag but you know I'm good 
 If a mic was a gun I'd be Bis Eastwood 
 Bandaging emcees, oxygen they can't breathe 
 Mad tricks up the sleeve wear boxers so my dick can breathe 
 Hip Hop is my drug 
 I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, one love
