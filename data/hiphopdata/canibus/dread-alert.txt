(Intro: Canibus) 
 Fraternity of the Impoverished 
 (Knowledge this, knowledge this) 
 (Canibus) 
 The vocalist beast, knowledge like the pope in this piece, 
 You think the ocean is deep? Fuck with me! 
 Unbelievable bars, unbeatable odds, 
 Unspeakable horrors at a unperceivable cost 
 Your unagreeable response lacks thought and human heart 
 This is Lyrical Law, it's what I make the music for 
 My prayers are simple, my forehead is layered with wrinkles 
 Because of all the hardships that I've been through 
 Symbolic Hip Hop prophet speak to your subconscious 
 French politics got the public thinking the opposite 
 I'm a hypo-lyrical spontaneous alchemical 
 Elite neo-liberal child of the indigo 
 Drilling holes through the Faraday cages of your brains 
 Then I implant the arcane image of Saint Germaine 
 High lyrical exponent intelligence quotient 
 When I'm focused I can engage multiple opponents 
 But I won't if, I have no motive, "Soldier be careful, it's loaded!" 
 Verbose with emotions of psychosis 
 In case you didn't notice when I wrote it, 
 I'm spitting lyrics fitting in tighter spaces than outer-space roaches 
 A real MC don't have to do what he don't wanna do 
 And that includes freestyling in front of you 
 It's not like something gone change, 
 It's not like the whole world gone start praising my name- I stay in my lane 
 I'd rather die by living brave then live like a slave 
 I'd rather be broke then be fake and get paid 
 These layers of physicality challenge me 
 My soul is gold and it's the only thing that's able to balance me 
 My energy body has a alchemical copy that looks godly 
 Not fat, out of shape, and sloppy 
 The iller the rhymes the more that I embody 
 Vilified when real recognize real - I gets mines 
 Stand with the underdog - don't be a coward 
 Stop dickriding people for their money and power! 
 Even an American flag says 'Made in China' 
 The national debt says that the US is a vagina 
 Of a black widow spider spraying blood out like a geyser 
 Why do we lose everything we fight for? 
 Fathers, mothers, sons, daughters 
 In the land of the lawless, sacrificed before Horus 
 The Inca, the Aztecs, the Mayans, were masters 
 A new beginning is coming - the irony is classic 
 The potential of life versus the potential of death 
 Either way you go through mad mental stress 
 God forbid for you, for her, or him 
 We ignored the gems now we gotta do it all again 
 We failed Hip Hop's laws and brought down shame upon our cause 
 Now we will fall upon our swords 
 The Shaman pays homage to Solomon 
 He orders them to send the witchdoctor in, then asked me to rhyme again 
 Every now and then I get retarded and spit 
 I would like to apologize to every artist I dissed 
 Everybody assumes that I wanna rhyme but I don't 
 Sometimes I just wanna chill and watch you flow 
 Mysteries of the cathedral, the dark overlords are evil 
 Ripped out the vocal cords of the people 
 I walk up to your bed side disguised with red eyes 
 And tell you to remember these rhymes 
 This is the season of Hip Hop believe it or not, 
 I lined it up with the planet's equinox 
 (??) 
 (Damo) 
 Melatonin Magik I'm a serotonin addict 
 It's the savage ode of the tragic microphone maverick 
 But nevertheless I'm waiting for the next time 
 To get shine, I pen my best rhymes close to deadline 
 The metaphor sorcerer slaughter ya poor orchestra 
 Where's the Source Award for the water-board torturer? 
 I'm rapping with savagery 
 Wreck so many mics the Shure manufacturing factory manager mad at me 
 You're all bite with no bark, on the microphone march 
 I spit harsh 'cause without a spark the fire wont start 
 The rules don't apply like I'm the government 
 I buy the rights to you're publishing the throw your masters right in the rubbish bin 
 I'm out to embarrass ya's, renouncing your marriages 
 And writing albums in the Arabic alphabet's characters 
 Ya wanna diss us then, get a pen 
 I'll put you in I.C.U and you'll be critical again but in a different sense 
 I should release a picture version of my rhyme pad 
 Full of photo's of wack rappers copping right jab's 
 I saw your silly rap set, I ain't really been matched yet 
 It's a one sided affair like necrophiliac sex 
 These animals are dangerous with teeth sharper than razors 
 The SpitBoss Administrators just let them out the cages 
 I'll pump you with compressed air until you hold your chest there 
 With a death stare, like you're in an electric chair with wet hair 
 I'll keep stepping until my feet hurt, you'll get beat worse 
 With free verse, have Bis wearing Free Damo T-shirts 
 With a mic I'm a ripper, I keep rhyming it sicker 
 Till I'm the Pulitzer prize-winner for writing literature scriptures 
 The Leviathan, fire in the belly, I'm high again 
 Deciphering an I.B.M wiring diagram 
 Pull strings like old fiddlers the outta control riddler 
 On malt liquor, wrongly referred to as Adolf Spitler 
 (??) 
 (Dante) 
 From the chisel and the rock, to the quill and the scroll docs 
 To the pencil and the paper and to MS-DOS 
 Mankind will control his thoughts until he ceases to be 
 Or these emcees are "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea" 
 I'm poetic; gimme a microphone and I'll wreck it 
 Gimme a wack record imperfected, and I'll perfect it 
 In one one-hundredth of a millisecond, I swear it 
 I could spend my whole life underground like a ferret 
 Spitting these hardcore lyrics with minimal interference 
 My appearance is reminiscent of Edgar Allen's spirit 
 When I shine like the Ark of the Covenant 
 I don't give a fuck what you people want; I'm the Iranian government 
 I'll battle you all the way to Hell; I battle convicts in cells 
 Blind people in Braille; deaf kids in ASL 
 But it's the atheists that don't hear me 
 So I'ma make 'em fear Dante's Inferno like they fear the 2012 theory 
 (Passion) 
 HaH, Yeah ... 
 Waddup, Its Passion ... 
 The lyrical Assassin nigga ... 
 Can I Bus ?! ... 
 Yo ... 
 I was summoned as the dominant Providence lyricist 
 Prominent lyrics get armored and honored, fulfilling bitch targets with 
 Confidence, killing civilian consciousness harder than British 
 Parliament getting uplifting compliments from communistic 
 Congressmen of other continents, Lyricism? I fathered it 
 With being the illest as the accomplishment 
 I harnessed it and polished it before other artist did 
 As the honest prophet with an anomalous source of partnership 
 Saw the beat and I tortured it, I'm the synonym of unfortunate 
 I'll show you what the meaning of slaughter is 
 In ordinance of ruthless shit, I tore the hands of Lucifers 
 To get my point across with his finger towards a crucifix 
 This lucrative movement is passing 
 I'm the motherfucker Passion, Creating musical tone patterns 
 From skeletal bone fragments, surpassing the masses 
 Turning ashes to flames, then flames back into ashes 
 I'm faster than dragsters 
 Swifter than download speeds on Napster 
 Valedictorian of speed classes, holding degree packets 
 Mastery above every Master, Fuck the Earth I'm holding the 
 Universe like Atlas when I rap shit 
 My deoxyribonucleic acid is the reason I'm that sick 
 'Cause I'm rapping for more, Cracking your jaw 
 Break your back into halfs, then to fractions of four 
 This is SpitBoss Holocaust, so you better acknowledge it 
 I heard the opportunity and followed it 
 Till there's nothing to bother with, React like a Halogen 
 Made the microphone my bitch, when I spit the trick swallows it 
 The obelisk of knowledge empowerment ploughed to the ground 
 Like the towers did, I stole your pussy pride and deflowered it 
 'Cause I'm tired of the cowardness and sick of the bitch-made 
 Slashed with your shoulder blade, Your souls trapped in your rib cage 
 If your willing to get slain? Then sacrifice your honor 
 So I can really guarantee your departure 
 You was the martyr for me to slaughter from border to border 
 Couldn't focus on one kill, I got Attention Deficit Disorder 
 Dread Alert, Dread Alert, V for Vendetta at work 
 This is lyrical fitness for all of Earth 
 Whenever I fuck a verse, it gets serious boy 
 I be ripping through more Trojans than Achilles in Troy 
 ... Motherfucker!
