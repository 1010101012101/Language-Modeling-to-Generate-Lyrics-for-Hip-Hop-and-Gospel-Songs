(Mr. cheeks) 
 Basically, lb fam to the motherfuckin death 
 Park side, queen's niggaz represent 
 Long isle, how we do? they new our style 
 Represent niggaz in and out the p now 
 Yo, I could do this mother shit for a while 
 I don't give a fuck, my rap style be true yo 
 Yo, eh yo, yo, yo, how we do this 
 Hey yo well back on my south side, jamaica part of town 
 Where us real niggas love to get down 
 Where you only hear g and p finessin tracks up on the tape 
 We stuck in queens and I'm not tryin' to escape 
 Yo I'm havin' cess', drinkin', I'm kickin raps and emceein 
 Lb for life, kid my way of bein 
 Its time to, set up shops, wild in this game and got props 
 And fuck cops, we puffin lah wit windows up in drop tops 
 Nothin' stops my crew from gettin' it we learn from the past 
 Puffin on this ounce of weed, I got this drink in my glass 
 Conversatin with myself, what does my future hold? 
 Niggaz is dyin', will I make it past 30 years old? 
 I can't run, I guess I gots to hold it down till I'm done 
 What the fuck's the deal? I been doin' this here from day one 
 Official queen's nigga, be a lost boy till my death 
 Until I breathe my mothafuckin last breath 
 Chorus: mr. cheeks {2x} 
 Eh yo from boyz to men 
 We're strictly fam, no longer friends 
 Lets keep it thorough, I hold it down till it's on again 
 Until we meet again, yo I'm back up on the street again 
 I'm tryin' to make it, throw out my nine but pack the heat again 
 (a+) 
 Check this out 
 Yo, yo 
 My mind is reachin' twice that size than it only did last year 
 Three times it's likely to feel clear 
 A+, I transform into a super emcee 
 With super vocals quicker than superman can find a phone booth 
 The whole truth nothin' but the whole truth, I roast you 
 Thermonuclear vocals get hotter that in shanobal 
 The double o, just abide nuclear explosions 
 Exposin radiation like a vulcan 
 I'm the only guy that knows why the golden eye 
 Was stolen by five soviet spies 
 They told me to lie, they don't want to hear the God spit 
 Chop my hands off at the armpits but I regenerate limbs 
 Like star fish, comin' at you with the hard shit 
 Swallow my beeper and page myself so I can communicate with a dolphin 
 Lyrical arson rush the planet like a million martians committin arson 
 Walkin' the tarpits in India with snake charmers that place all the weight 
 Down... 
 (Canibus) 
 A+ fuck the non-sense, I got the reinforcements 
 To crush any enemies offence, with a hundred thousand horsemen 
 The hardest mother fucker on the market, right here 
 I complete in a minute, what would take you a light year 
 Extra-terrestrial, biological entities 
 With infinite energy, battling for world supremacy 
 Who want to get touch, the Can-I-Bus will crush you 
 With hard jigsaw puzzles, and strong jaw muscles 
 Ambushing emcees, jumping out the trees 
 Like Vietnamese, in fatigues, covered with leafs 
 Interrogating you wack emcees, like M.I.B.'s 
 With dark glasses, asking you to tell me exactly 
 Where that alien craft landed, by flashing 
 Bright lights in your eyes with them silver gammas 
 So when you revive, you can't recall or understand it 
 That's how the Canibus keeps tabs on the planet 
 I use amnesia to neutralize public panic 
 And take advantage, and opportunities to do damage 
 I pierce your heart, with evil thoughts 
 The only thing faster than the speed of light, is the speed of dark 
 With the jaws of a great-white shark, I rip you apart 
 My state of the art, lyrical lasers is razor sharp 
 Splatter the brain matter, of my enemies 
 With the same bullet trajectory, that murdered John Kennedy 
 In the back of his cranial cavity 
 Which is accidentally what happens to any mother fucker for trying to battle me
