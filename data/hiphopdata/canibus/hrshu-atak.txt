3-60 deal means you getting circle by a shark boy 
 You better beg your pardon, turn into a HRSMN, slaughter him 
 I'm an Undergod, you too over confident 
 So stop talking nigga 'cause you can all get it 
 W-A-R nigga I'm raw with it 
 Don't let the alcohol fuck with your short vision 
 I'll knock you out of the park nigga, long distance 
 I wrote this rhyme in five minutes 
 I'm like ten Ghostface Killah's and twenty five GZA's 
 So fuck with me if you want to, nigga I'm bark proof 
 It's like you on Twitter with nobody to talk to 
 Crush your spine 59 times with a HRSHU 
 Scald you nigga, don't say I didn't warn you 
 You never had enough rhymes to fuck with mines 
 You know what they calling you right, Moist 5'9" 
 You suped up 'cause you got signed 
 You getting so much shine you going fucking blind
