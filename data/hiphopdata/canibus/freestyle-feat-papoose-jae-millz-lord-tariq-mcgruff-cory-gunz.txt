(Canibus) 
 Ayo I put it to you so raw you probably OD on the floor 
 That's what you get for disagreeing with god 
 The Lebron James born, my aim with the arm is so long 
 That I can tag along with SOCOM 
 I spit to the beat, flip like Swiss did to the beat 
 At sunrise I spit to the east 
 Niggas talk shit in the streets, when they bout' to get released 
 They ain't got no lip for the beast 
 Make you strip like police, I point the heat 
 From the hip to get leveraged if you more than 4 deep 
 Got a Pistol Grip Hawk with a Chrome beak 
 Shit is so deep, I check to make sure there's no leak 
 Lookin' like Jada in a Black Jagari, 
 Half black half Ferrari, the vale saw me 
 Shorty wanna know how the flesh work 
 What's under my sweatshirt, that's why I hit the gym till my chest hurt 
 Next year summer imma killer conjecture 
 For now I'm just a hustler tryna give you my best work
