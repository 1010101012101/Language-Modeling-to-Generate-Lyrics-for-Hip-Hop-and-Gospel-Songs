(Canibus) 
 I wreck that shit, mic check that shit 
 Canibus nigga he's the best that spit 
 Step on stage and pace left to right 
 Like a lion ready to bite, you dying tonight 
 More lines to your forehead than Brian McKnight 
 With thousand watt voice box I'ma fry 'em tonight 
 I be shitting on sight, meticulous with the mic 
 It's a mic but I rip it like I'm palming a knife 
 Lyricist that don't Lounge, break a nigga down 
 Since you're iced out you can keep the swelling down 
 Lift you off the ground with chokehold till your bitch screams 
 Let him down he's a Mic Club member now 
 Beat you wit my brow, force you to speak loud 
 Like motherfuckers give me 50 bars right now 
 I'm the King of the pack, bringing it back 
 Tell the queen of the pride to come sit on my lap 
 It's a wrap 
 (Canibus) 
 You should feel your maggots, ain't ready for the illest rappers 
 Allied Meta-Forces of the joint axis 
 Computative compliance of the rhyme science 
 Protected by the Mic Club security advises 
 (Canibus) 
 Too violent to tame, wolf bane bangs through my veins 
 Put emcees to shame 
 The lyrical linguist spitting vintage colonial English 
 Like who art thou, bow to the 10 inch dick sucketh it
