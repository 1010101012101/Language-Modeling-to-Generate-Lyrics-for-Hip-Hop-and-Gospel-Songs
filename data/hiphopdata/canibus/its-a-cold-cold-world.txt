This goes out to the motherfucker that stole my rhyme book 
 Let me tell ya what design you took 
 Ya got a piece of batch 14 article 3 
 I hope you have a good time it's a remarkable read 
 It can make you marketable indeed 
 You now got ya hands on the secrets of a master MC 
 Personalized print extra wide script so my eyes don't squint 
 My mind thinks smoke rise through the vent 
 Try to rework the theory but the logic is thin 
 I possess the body of jin with a fight klub win 
 Maybe its just a mic club thing fuck a sling 
 You could duck a swing I spit webs duck one of them 
 My fingerprints on your soul when I touch a pen 
 We interact when you memorize the raps 
 Identify that syntax applied with stats 
 When I open my mouth it's like sliding back the bolt 
 No joke leave a hole in you was an insult 
 You better check the wind direction when I talk 
 Before and after somewhere in between I blast ya 
 Rhymes on deck check the chart specs 
 Light yo ass up it ain't even dark yet
