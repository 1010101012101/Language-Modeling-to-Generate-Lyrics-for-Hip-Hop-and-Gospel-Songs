 I vaguely remember 1974 when I was born 
 As soon as the doctor cut my umbilical cord he put me in my mother's arms 
 I was crying when she looked down at me 
 She was smiling 'cause I guess she was happy 
 She absolutely had no idea 
 I was flowing 'cause it wasn't quite clear 
 She just kept tickling me and ignoring me

 My native home was Jamaica (No problems man) 
 We moved to the states a few years later 
 I had trouble fitting in (What did you say?) 
 'Cause I had a funny speech impediment 
 People couldn't understand what I mean 
 Meeda sata greedafa zeen (Sha oh) 
 I used to wear cross-colored jeans 
 Rasta belts with the red, gold, and green 
 My man used to boost travel pocket for me

 In '93 I met the Lost Boyz 
 Without them I wouldn't even have a voice 
 I showed the world I was nice with the verbals 
 That's how I got signed to Universal 
 I released two albums 
 In all I sold nine-hundred and ninety-nine-thousand 
 Over the years a lot of people tried to diss me 
 'Cause I grabbed a piece of Hip Hop history 
 Thank God that the drama didn't destroy me

 I took a trip to England with PakMan 
 Five months later we met Stan 
 He was cool so we let him join the band 
 And introduced him to the rest of the Horsemen 
 Then I hooked up with this cat named Lou 
 And he was cool with C-4 too 
 Now the whole crew's on tour with me 
 True Hollywood Stories 
 (Canibus) 
 This is a story about beef 
 Arrogance, lies and deceit 
 This is an independent release 
 And that's why it's totally dependent on the streets 
 I ain't got no record label behind me 
 Maybe nobody got the balls to sign me 
 But it's cool 'cause soon they'll all be calling me 
 This is a True Hollywood Story
