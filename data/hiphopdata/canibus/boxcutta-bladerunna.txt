(18 second car chase intro to start) 
 (Canibus) 
 Record industries most wanted: Rip the Jacker 
 Wanted for the '98 slayings of several rappers 
 One of which went on to be a successful actor 
 Here's the reenactment: He called me at my man's crib 
 The phone probably rang two times then I answered 
 He sounded really amped up, he tried to scare me 
 He told me that DEF JAM wanted to ban me 
 And told me Tracy Waples wanted to bang me 
 Damn I wanted to get in her panties, she was scared of me 
 Canibus hates the media and the magazines 
 They add so much credibility to elaborate schemes 
 Internet chat rooms with live feeds 
 Of a rapper being eaten alive by live bees 
 Sound barriers like the Lockheed 
 Even with knock knees I run across rough terrain at mach speed 
 That's a rhyme from like 9-3 
 As vivid in the mind as pictures with six hundred DPI's to a sheet 
 If I'm high when I speak the knowledge is deep 
 Solid as concrete, this is real Hip-Hop for the streets 
 I never leave any witnesses, it's ridiculous 
 They served me court papers in the studio I did this in 
 Missing from society because they lied to me 
 They didn't want to accept my doctrine of society 
 I studied with hundreds of scientists and science teams 
 In various Ivy leagues, they respect my esteem 
 What do you want me to rap about? Go ahead try a theme 
 Give me a person, place or thing, I'll create the time and scene 
 Somewhere in Afghanistan USA survival teams 
 Keep an eye on their surroundings in the jihad regime 
 A total riot scene 
 Back and forth they encrypt fiber-optic beams 
 On my album out next spring 
 You mother fucking right nigga, I'm about that cream 
 I promised myself I wouldn't shoot it without that scene 
 It doesn't look right like Cash Money without that bling 
 Siblings, I mean, we all got the same last name 
 Germaine Williams that's my name 
 Say it again, Germaine Williams, damn 
 I think he goes by the name of the Canibus-man 
 And occasionally Rip the Jacker but never Stan 
 Get it through your head and don't ask me again 
 'Box Cutta' Blade Runna' nigga rap till you sweat 
 Have you ever read the book called, "The Catcher in the Rye"? 
 It so happens I'm looking for a copy I could buy 
 Canibus is coming for y'all 'Round the Outside, Round the Outside, Round the Outside' 
 A lot of y'all shine but y'all can't rhyme 
 And it's about time that I put y'all in line 
 Twist your mind with twisted rhymes 
 As weird as Michael Jackson's nose from the side 
 Flows that abide, quite bold for the times 
 No need to hide, your friends are associates of mine 
 Don't be a stranger, come over some time 
 I got coke if you do lines, you'll get a Rover to drive 
 If you hear the engine knocking just pull over to the side 
 I guess it hasn't been serviced in all this time 
 Halloween, True Hollywood Stories release date 
 We should have a 'Who Wants to Battle Canibus' sweepstakes 
 And limit it to three states, New York City home of the greats 
 Philly and out west, piece of cake 
 Old school rappers I wouldn't be around without 
 Ain't got shit to say but keep putting albums out 
 Don't let what I said get you upset 
 'Box Cutta' Blade Runna' nigga, rap till you sweat!
