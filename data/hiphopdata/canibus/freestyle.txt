(Mike Tyson) 
 Get acquainted to the one and the only 
 The future, hip-hop king 
 Forever, the Canibus... (The Funkmaster Flex is coming!) 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, yo 
 For all you niggaz sayin' that my shit is sick, just imagine 
 The ninety percent of my brain that I ain't even used yet 
 Take a deep breath, quick, suck in as much air 
 As my lungs will permit -- then I start to kick that shit 
 I been gettin' busy before the planets started to turn 
 Before the bees, the birds, and Adam and Eve occurred 
 Prior to all creation, in other words 
 When the female egg will merge with the man's sperm 
 I stand firm, my words burn through your exterior 
 The eat away at your materia, I'm superior 
 While you only pretend to be, I can double my density 
 From three-sixty degrees to seven-twenty instantly 
 Six, multiplied by five by four by three by two 
 Then one, go head and calculate the sum 
 The time has cometh, I was summoned to punish 
 Motherfuckers with mouths to run it ? with rubbish 
 When I come through, niggaz stand stiller than statues 
 'Cause if I have to, I'll battle your whole rap crew 
 Then I'll attack you with words that's absurd 
 And rip your fuckin' skin off just to get on your nerves 
 *Flex scratches*
