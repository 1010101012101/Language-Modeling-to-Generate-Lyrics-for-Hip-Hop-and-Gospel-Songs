Yeah, my man Temper be burnin em', From anywhere to Birmingham 
 Shake, spray, create, display 
 With a burst of wind... That create Jam Master J 
 Wassup man?! 
 The Shadow Man with a Hallow hand, holdin' a hollow can 
 The Canvas composer, notice how he motions his hands 
 He can paint a rendition of your face 
 In the epicenter of a earthquake, aight' mate? 
 Spit cold saliva out the window of my low rider 
 Gold visors protect the eyes of the microphone pilot
