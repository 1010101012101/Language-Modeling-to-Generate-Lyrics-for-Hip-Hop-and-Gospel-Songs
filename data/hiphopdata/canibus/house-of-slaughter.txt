I will ooze lyrical exactitude from your bitches boobs 
 To prove good things comes in two's 
 I refuse to lose I lost and paid more dues 
 So 9 times out of 10 I'm in a confused mood 
 They listen to my shit 
 But what is the dynamics of the relationship 
 Why do niggas listen like this 
 I'ma show you something out of this world 
 Word is bond 
 Watch shaka zulu put his cock in chaka khan 
 So many stressful thoughts 
 My heart wants to take me to court 
 So many scars all over the god 
 Nobody move nobody nod 
 Nobody got y'all? nobody at all 
 Your body is a casualty of war 
 Above the fangs and the horns 
 That's where the halo is worn 
 I was just informed 
 That slaughterhouse joined 
 Fuck it 
 Real kings recognize real kings 
 Get busy is my thing 
 I don't care about the ring 
 I'm one quarter horsemen 
 My horse jaws flying saucers 
 Before your time I rode pegasuses mama 
 The horses talk about slaughter 
 Double shot dose of karma 
 I ride bare chest they wear armor 
 We will strike at dawn father 
 And meet you back at the altar 
 Before the daylight wanders 
 And the crescent moon changes my conduct 
 How long you been gone bus'? 
 I come back covered in dog blood 
 Fall back slaughter rap 
 Fire crossbow off horseback 
 Complete the whole course and all that 
 Follow dog paw prints in the snow 
 To your door mat 
 Find where the prince keeps the hawk at 
 Carrier ship whale guns impale you bums 
 With nails that weigh tons 
 And feels like a blunt sponge 
 Crush crystal to crumbs 
 Crystal meth aluminum lungs 
 Still spitting with a tumor for a tongue 
 The fat lady sings 
 The fat man silences the slut 
 The horse gallops to the rhythm of the drum 
 Come through like yeah 
 Beijing all up in the beer 
 Horses in armor everybody scared 
 The gods have appeared and you not prepared 
 You had lots of chances not one was fair 
 The sound of compressed air in your ears are here 
 In the same hemisphere is clear 
 The hrsmn are here 
 The supper came all the way from Sweden 
 That's a real long way to go just for something to get eaten 
 Better make sure you decent 
 Prepare food bring the beast in 
 Seat them over here I wanna see everything 
 Lights start to dim go to auxiliary power 
 Somebody get over here and talk to him 
 When brutus and judas come to slit my throat 
 I bleed all over their hands and still spit what I wrote 
 An irreversible plague the scourge of a soon coming age 
 You are wise not to number your days 
 The irreversible plague you know my name 
 The house of slaughter and the hrsmn on top of the game
