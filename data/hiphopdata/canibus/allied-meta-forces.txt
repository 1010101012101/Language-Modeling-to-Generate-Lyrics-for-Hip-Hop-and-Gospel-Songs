(Canibus) 
 Yo, the shotee rip, perforate the skin on top of your ribs 
 Red stuff comes out of squibs like a Hollywood script 
 Bitch niggas on the floor screaming for mommy and shit 
 Cardiologists hook up the heart monitors quick 
 Thermometer temperature dips below seventy-six 
 That's what you get for telling niggas that you're better than 'Bis 
 Not possible, if I can't pronounce it, it ain't rhymable 
 The audible probability probably ain't probable 
 Supreme rap, G rap underground without a roof 
 Chopper proof, holding Hip Hop for hostage about to shoot 
 Helicopters stabilize at low altitudes 
 I'm talking to the negotiator laying out the rules 
 In a tight compromising loop, road blocked with troops 
 Under orders not to shoot but they break your vertebra with boots 
 Ten O'clock news flash, Bis and G Rap 
 All points bulletin looking for them niggas in black 
 Leaned back in an Avocado Eldorado 
 Passing the bottle, speaking Japanese like, 'No me mah show' 
 She's got a baging body, cold sushi with warm saki 
 And if I'm rapping sloppy G's got me 
 (Kool G Rap) 
 Welcome to my world, danger and hazards 
 Gang of bastards, banging they ratchets 
 King and the Jacker, slanging in traffic 
 Claiming they cabbage, obtain half, they aiming for static 
 Get brains from an addict, keep blinging with karats 
 Cops see me in Maddox, then let ya dame have it, flames to the attic 
 The stains on ya fabric, the paint in the graphic 
 Canibus and G Rap, banging a classic 
 And if that beef on the street - hate you enough 
 Blow out ya brain in your casket 
 Don't you love this drug element? 
 Where slugs crush your melanin dome 
 Chrome that's known to break bones in an elephant 
 Shotgun pellets and, gunsmoke; smell the scent 
 Big bullets, wiggle your guts like gelatin 
 Cut through your skeleton, knockage intelligence 
 Ride, stand, and bite the dust 
 Jake wanna be like a Russian cuffed on that Riker bus 
 We raised in the slums, with haze in our lungs 
 Raising the guns, knowing 
 My day'll come, razors under the tongue 
 Clips in the steel, bricks in the wheels 
 Chips in the field of fortune 
 Dead men walking with hits on the grills 
 Late night at the spot, posted with goons, dope and balloons 
 Coke and the doom, scheme 
 I'll leave you open with wounds nigga 
 Witness G Rap put it back in perspective 
 Beat up shit with a dash of the peppers, get blast for ya necklace 
 Leave ya brains on the dash in your Lexus 
 We up in the club, dash for the exit 
 Make ya spread 'em out - show you what this lead about 
 Take it from an old thug, whoever clean cold blood 
 Believe they bled it out (yo) 
 Crave for the war, pop out rages with fours 
 Hit the jackpot, blazing the raw - getting bands in the pores 
 Bitches in draws with dick in their jaws 
 The frame drank sick of Valour, straight bandit spot 
 Open up shop, turn the block to 'Planet Rock' 
 Shit with no chop, slept with the glock with the hammer cocked 
 Serving the fiends, hop in the Suburban and lean 
 Look at that don nigga swerving in Queens, player 
 Balling a lot, brawling for props, calling the shots 
 Hit the curb, birds all on the flock 
 Jocking, like "who that there covered in all of them rocks" 
 It's royalty bitch, fall on the cock, recognize one 
 Giacanna G Rap, that live one - pay homage 
 Get it fucked up, I spray comments, nigga what 
 (Nigga what, it's the Curriculum! Mic Club) 
 (Canibus) 
 Anything is everything my nigga 
 I ain't bitter but if I give you the finger it'll be behind a trigger 
 Faggot ass nigga living in a gated community 
 Up at radio telling them what you're going to do to me 
 I live in the 'burbs 
 Clean my Winchester every other weekend with the same dirty Hanes shirt 
 It takes two to tango, three to jump rope 
 Four to bury the body plus look out for po' 
 Yo, I guard everything within the limits of my post 
 My orders are to smoke you if you get too close 
 The whole globe is scared of my flow 
 Spirit world, scared of my soul 
 Nowadays it's like I'm scared to be known 
 The methods of my motivation is completely subjective 
 My perception is completely parallel to perspective 
 Rhyming is the reason I spit in faces 
 Habituation of my flamboyance without rational reservation 
 Whiskey, X-Ray, Yankee, Zulu, unusual 
 Wordologically my syllable position is beautiful 
 Only respect niggas if the feeling is mutual 
 G Rap snatched the jewels fom you, I'll throw them in the crucible 
 Probably throw you in it too, mix it up and make nigga stew 
 If you can't admit that I'm iller than you 
 Baby, you're sparring with the shadows, Canibus and G Rap flow 
 Motherfucker you're 'fessionalling with the Pros 
 (Kool G Rap) 
 Know it's, dough over hoes - bankrolls, Rovers and clothes 
 And shots blow all them cowards and foes 
 Giacanna proud with the pros, foul mode 
 We quick reachers, spear with the fearless till you drip liters 
 Flip divas, the big secret, strip to they tits and beaver 
 Sip Cris' and sniff coke of the peeter 
 Yeah we ball big baby, look off the meter 
 You should see us, it's movie star status 
 Scar lackers lost cabbage, rip the Pablo Escobar fabrics 
 Froze the road we chose, not a pretty route, Diddied out 
 Grimey and grittied out, stack dough, jiggy out 
 Dime bitches behavin like ya sex slave skizzied out 
 Some nigga dizzy south, till he's out, busy mouth 
 Swerve to the curb, hit the bird split the kitties out 
 We kidnap for trap - blackmail for a gang a mill 
 Spot banger himself, fishscale rocks under the fingernails 
 The blood trail lead to a corpse 
 Treat my appetite for greed with a torch 
 For keys to a Porsche, to breeze in the loft 
 Roll up my hand sheets with the force 
 We squeeze off, no need for remorse, player 
 Forty wild goons, we forty Calhouns 
 You die forty foul dooms for forty coward moves 
 Bless sparkle, and spark until my shorty style rules 
 Giancanna dead? Widespread, I'll be a 40 mile tune nigga 
 What, what nigga? The noble laureate 
 Comin' at y'all niggaz 
 Uh... 40-pound style nigga...
