(Intro: Mike Tyson) 
 Yo Canibus man, whassup man? 
 I caught you on that cut with Wyclef man - you were booming 
 But I caught these foul slouch-ass niggaz, youknowmean? 
 Talking foul 'bout you the other night 
 On the corner of the boulevard man - I wasn't with that 
 But I ain't know you well enough to defend you though right? 
 But you seem like you got true game 
 But... peep game man, they've been playing me all my life man 
 You know I won the title a couple of times, did right, youknowmean? 
 But they can't hurt us man, we gon' do it 
 Get up in this ring man put on these gloves 
 Let me show how to handle yourself man 
 You don't got nobody out there with you 
 I gots to show you man, get up in there move that head man 
 Come on to me man, but when you come man you gotta come for blood man 
 Come up to me man, come on bust that nigga whole man 
 Niggaz talking that shit about you... 
 (Intro 2: Mike Tyson) 
 Hey Mike Tyson here speaking with the Canibus man over here 
 Yo Canibus your main objective out here is to do nuttin but 
 Eat eat eat eat MCs, for lunch, breakfast 
 Hey man they been playing me all my life man 
 You know I won the title a couple of times did right 
 No but they can't hurt us man 
 We gonna do it, get up in this ring man, put on these gloves 
 Let me show you how to handle this yourself man 
 (Canibus) 
 So I'ma let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine 
 You studied my rhyme, then you laced your vocals after mine 
 That's a bitch move, something that a homo rapper would do 
 So when you say that you platinum, your only dropping clues 
 I studied your background, read the book that you wrote 
 Researched the footnotes, 'bout how you used to sniff coke 
 Fronting like a drug-free role model, you disgust me 
 I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently 
 You walk around showing off your body 'cause it sells 
 Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills 
 Mad at me 'cause I kick that shit real niggas feel 
 When ninety-nine percent of your fans wear high-heels 
 From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay-Z 
 Now you wanna fuck with me? You must be crazy 
 You dripping with wack juice, and you can't get it off 
 You better be prepared to finish what you start, nigga 
 (Break: Referee) 
 Hey hey hey. You just hold it right there 
 We got an illegal low blow the fighter in the blue trunks 
 If I see one more of those your outta here brother, you understand 
 You'll be disqualified 
 Stop bein a bitch, we came to see a fight 
 (Break Background: Canibus) 
 Yo, get off me man, yo, yo get the fuck off me man 
 Yo, get out of my way man, he started this shit 
 Fuck you, I'll bite that nigga again 
 Get the fuck off me man 
 (Break 2: Mike Tyson) 
 Yo Canibus man you gotta hit harder then that man 
 You don't want no bitch ass niggaz hangin' out wit me man 
 We're warriors man 
 When we go into battle we come out or don't come out at all 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, You better give me the respect that I deserve, or I'ma take it by force 
 Blast you with a forty-five Colt, make you somersault 
 Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts 
 Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk 
 It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first 
 That's why I laugh when I hear that wack ass verse 
 That shit was the worse rhyme I ever heard in my life 
 'Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March ninth 
 God bless his soul, rest in peace kid 
 It's because of him, now at least I know what beef is 
 It's not what I would call this, see this is something different 
 A faggot nigga trying to make a living off of dissing 
 Somebody that he got to know is better than him 
 But he's feeling himself, 'cause he got more cheddar than him 
 Well let me tell you something, you might got more cash than me 
 But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me 
 And if you really want to show off, we can get it on 
 Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom 
 I'll let you kick a verse, fuck it, I'll let you kick them all 
 I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud 
 Now watch me rip the tat from your arm 
 Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award 
 In front of your mom your first, second, and third born 
 Make your wife get on the horn, call Minister Farrakhan 
 So he could persuade me to squash it, I'd say, "Nah, he started it, 
 He forgot what a hardcore artist is." 
 A hardcore artist is a dangerous man, such as myself 
 Trained to run twenty miles in soft sand 
 On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars off hand 
 From a lost and forgotten land 
 You done did it man, you done spitted some wack shit 
 And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'd forget it? 
 Fuck that, 'cause like Common and Cube I see the bitch in you 
 And I'ma make the world see it too, motherfucker 
 (Break: Ring Announcer) 
 Ladies and gentleman, we have a new lyrical weight champion 
 By Second Round Knockout, three minutes and forty seconds Can-I-Bus 
 (Outro 2: Mike Tyson) 
 Yo, Canibus man you moving like Mike Tyson junior, man 
 You in and out and you agile with you flow man 
 But dig right, you got you got meet man, that's your name Canibus 
 Your whole agenda is to eat these niggaz man 
 They have no business to be in the same stage with you 
 Holding the mic with you 
 But dig right 
 But dig right 
 But dig right 
 But dig right 
 Hey Mike Tyson here speaking with the Canibus man over here 
 Yo Canibus your main objective out here is to do nothing but 
 Eat Eat Eat Eat MCs for lunch breakfast dinner 
 That's your agenda baby, your agenda to consume them 
 Their whole existence, they can't exist in your presence 
 The Canibus is here to rule forever 
 Mike Tyson on the Def
