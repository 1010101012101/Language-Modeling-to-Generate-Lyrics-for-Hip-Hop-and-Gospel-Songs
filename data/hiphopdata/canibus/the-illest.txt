I grind, I scramble, I put them both together and gramble 
 Bag up the gram, separate the samples 
 The goddamn truth this ain't nothing to dance to 
 My lyrics lynch you, give you something to hang to 
 Your fans mourn, mumbling your song 
 While the Son of Sam prepares for war 
 My hands form ram horns 
 Daddy ain't to shabby he rarely rhymes badly 
 Sadly he's not too punchy, but still jabby 
 Stick and move keep stepping, follow my reflection 
 Demolition any nigga disrespecting the profession 
 Better holster that weapon when you walk in this direction 
 Is there ever enough protection? The quintessential question 
 Unroll your maps I'ma show you where we at 
 Pull a rhyme out the burlap and murder your raps 
 You heard of that, my sandbag leak worser than that 
 The cowboy going to church with a curve in his hat
