(Canibus) 
 I'll battle you on the net, I'll battle you in the flesh 
 I'll battle you over the phone; you can call me collect 
 Verbally vicious, telekinetically gifted 
 Took a minute to exhibit that I'm sick with it 
 Have you any idea what I'll do to crews like you? 
 How many niggas in my career I've ran through? 
 At a thousand degrees Celsius I make emcees melt 
 Fuck my record label, I appear courtesy of myself 
 Canibus is the type to fight for mics 
 Beating niggas to death, and beating dead niggas to life 
 While you niggas is babbling my lyrics is traveling 
 Like a javelin to stab you in the abdomen 
 The intellectual athlete accurately rapping so rapidly 
 Yet he makes perfect sense mathematically 
 I walk the B-lock, with the G-lock, C-ocked 
 Tryin'na get the D.R.-op, on the C-ops 
 The Canibus is an animal, with a mechanical mandible 
 Coming to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you 
 Rhymes ricochet off the inner walls of my lungs 
 And go past the tongue faster than bullets come out of guns 
 Whenever the head is severed from the human body with a sharp enough weapon 
 The brain remains conscious for ten seconds 
 What's the matter with y'all? I'll spatter y'all 
 Against the motha fucking wall with these raw lyrics I catapult 
 I'll hop into the back seat of a cab and rhyme 
 Till the meter says, 'nine, nine, nine, nine' 
 (Canibus) 
 Yeah, it's the C-Quel, the C-Quel 
 Yo 
 I'm hardcore from the nappy follicles in my pores 
 To every single pore in my skull, hard from my mouth to my jaws 
 From my jaws to my torso where my organs are stored 
 And from my balls in my drawers to the floor 
 I pray to God they hurry up and start the Third World War 
 So I can start World War Four, and murder us all 
 I don't give a fuck if you rich or you poor 
 Don't give a fuck if you got your picture in The Source or Forbes 
 I don't give a fuck who won an award 
 On stage tryna thank God, I'll chop they tongue off with a sword 
 Let they blood pour all on the floor 
 If it ain't a cordless, they getting punched in the jaw, and hung with the cord 
 I'll leave your corpse stiff as a board 
 Like frozen meat tryin'na thaw, then bury him under the morgue 
 Getting in my way is like jumping in front of a car 
 Breaking the sound barrier, that means the car is in front of the horn 
 By the time you hear it blowing, it's too late to respond 
 By the time you feel it hit you, I'm gone 
 I'll send you to hell where you belong 
 So by the time your body hits the floor, your spirit won't be in it no more 
 Who could flow for four minutes or more 
 Without breaks, without mistakes, without flaws 
 Got millions of styles and I've mastered them all 
 A metaphor matador fast enough to make the bull charge and crash in the wall 
 (Canibus) 
 Whoever grabs the mic after me will get booed 
 Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew 
 I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it 
 I'll snatch your crown with your head still attached to it 
 I'll battle you for the respect, I'll battle you over a blank-check 
 I'll battle you with a gun to my neck 
 Ambushing emcees, jumping out the trees like Vietnamese 
 In fatigues, covered with leaves 
 Next year, you'll be walking around the 'How Can I be Down?' Conference 
 With a laminate, that says 'I got shitted on by Canibus' 
 Turn your head around, give me the cheddar 
 I'd rather be a lion for a day than a lamb who lives forever 
 Fuck y'all, you don't impress me and no one can test me 
 An emcee so ill I got A.I.D.S. scared to catch me 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, Yo, Yo 
 Canibus is what the hardcore niggas is waiting on 
 Debating on, what the fuck is taking so long 
 Well I'm here now, verbal ass whippings 'bout to get shared out 
 Wack niggas bout to get aired out 
 Faggot niggas get they ass teared out 
 Grab a wise-man by his goatee and rip his fucking beard out 
 Cold beat a niggas ass like stout 
 Then bust a shot in the motherfucking courtroom and watch it clear out 
 A hundred-thousand mile warranty 
 Metaphorically, I'll use a hundred thousand styles and murder you orally 
 Took a lion on tour with me, made him respect authority 
 Smacked him in the head for tryna roar at me 
 Lyrics got my undivided loyalty 
 And there ain't nothing on this God damn planet that's worth more to me 
 In the name of Hip-Hop, niggas could corner me 
 Torture me, slice me then stitch me up like embroidery 
 Way back before gold-plated male and female 
 R.C.A. jacks was used for crystal clear playback 
 I was tryna blaze a D.A.T.S., and if a nigga said my demo was wack 
 I'd beat his ass and took my tape back 
 'Yeah nigga' (smack) 'what? Yeah nigga take that' 
 Anybody get outta' line, get they face slapped 
 Quick fast, the Can-I-Bus will bust your ass 
 Then I bust you with a shotgun blast 
 It's not fun so I don't laugh 
 To me this rap shit is as serious as, the death of a loved one 
 You know how I be feeling sad? 
 That's how I feel when I grab the microphone, but niggas don't understand 
 Canibus is unequivocally, the illest killing machine in the industry 
 For the twentieth-century 
 Trapped in a max security building 
 Suffering from a severe illness called brilliance
