(Canibus) 
 Yo, 
 I done been from Jersey to Brooklyn 
 Done been through Queens where the crooks hang 
 Done been on tour doing group things 
 'Cause I'm always chasing that poontang 
 Really love it when a girl got a cute name 
 Got a cute attitude and a cute frame 
 Got a big-ass butt, breasts and no brain 
 Them things make a nigga want to shoot game 
 Now check it, I've done been through a few things 
 Done seen a lot more than some loose change 
 Always been open-minded to new things 
 But before a rap nigga, I'm a true fan 
 Been a Hip-Hop nigga since youth, man 
 Beatbox and breakdance too, man 
 Use to do Electric Boogaloos, man 
 Do Egyptian Lover with two hands 
 I remember when I lived down south, yo 
 In a hot ass one-story house, yo 
 Where the AC was always going out, yo 
 Sometimes spend the whole day outdoors 
 We had a block-party, barbeque 
 Eating food in the pool 
 Music got us in that mood 
 Everybody act a fool 
 But I'm gonna tell you like this, man 
 Every night I go down to the city, man 
 To the gentlemen's club, where my niggas hang 
 Them stripper chicks know how to strip, man 
 DJ's be spinning them hits, man 
 Play the Cash Money Click and the Jigga-man 
 Them hoes be thick but sick, man 
 Every stripper think a mother-fucka rich, man 
 Like Sisqo the R&B singer, man 
 Think I got a bank account with a million, man 
 Case of Cristal cost about six grand 
 Bitch better get a less expensive brand 
 Got to stick to the budget when I trick, man 
 How about ten dollars for a sip, man? 
 The whole dance for a ten dollar tip, man? 
 Still waiting on my royalty check, man 
 How about a rain-check this time, yo? 
 How about a handful of coupons, yo? 
 How about tickets to my next five shows? 
 Turn around, let me touch that behind, yo
