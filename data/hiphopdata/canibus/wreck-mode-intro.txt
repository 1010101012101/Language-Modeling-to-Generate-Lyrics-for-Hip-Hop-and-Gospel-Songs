Yeah, how y'all feel out there 
 Hip Hop is here, Hip Hop is everywhere 
 Hip Hop ain't going nowhere 
 Yeah, scroll down look around you might find some tunes 
 And remember I do this for you 
 Rip the Jacker II: Infinity coming soon 
 Alone in my room visualising the moon 
 My rap flow is mondofacto 
 Grab you by the throat, slash it open with the X-Acto 
 Rip the Jacker in an underground fortress 
 But carving morbid, pay attention as I paint the portrait 
 Microphone electrode in Wreck Mode nigga
