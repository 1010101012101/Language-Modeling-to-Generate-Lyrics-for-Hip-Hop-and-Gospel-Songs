Yeah! Bar Exam 2! 
 I landslide you to the lava below, Kata Stance nigga flow 
 How many bars? how far can you go? 
 Only as far as the mind, Canibus and Royce 5'9" 
 Bar Exam 2, spit a rhyme 
 A miniature version of me, told me he wanted to MC 
 I told him, be careful who you be 
 He said, "I'ma just be me" 
 I said, "Yeah, I see, but you don't understand what I really mean" 
 Look at the manifest list, it got my name down 
 A bald head for a cold crown, how you like me now? 
 I terrorize rap music, what manner 
 Of creature could do this? Canibus, stupid 
 Spit retarded, autistic artist, one click per fixed target 
 Staff sergeant Canibus talking! 
 I would not let off the gas, traversing through Sanzo's pass 
 The ripper spills whiskey from a flask 
 (Always, come back to me) 
 (Break) 
 Road blast, don't ask, just put on your ProMask 
 Back in one piece, but not as a whole man 
 Captain Cold Crush Canibus, analyse the anaglyph 
 Somebody please build this man a spliff 
 The Mummy of Anubis, Bar Exam 2, quote you, Bis 
 Bar Exam 3, just spit 
 A millie, a millie, a billie, a fucking tranquillie 
 The air smells pissy, inside the tent city 
 Are we humble servants or belligerent slaves? 
 There's a difference in the ways we were made to behave 
 So what you saying? I'm saying Hip Hop is forever ours, yo! 
 And I'ma always come back when the song go: 
 (Always, come back to me) 
 (Break) 
 I landslide you to the lava below 
 Kata Stance nigga flow 
 How many bars? how far can you go? 
 Only as far as the mind, Canibus and Royce 5'9" 
 Bar Exam 2! Spit a rhyme!
