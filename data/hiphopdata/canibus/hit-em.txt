Aiyo, I sanctified the notepad with blood from a cold hand 
 That's the reason why I rhyme like no man 
 Without no keys, this is still a motif 
 Illuminated lyrics, dope rhymes over dope beats 
 My ears back engineer the sound they hear 
 Someone ask you if I get busy, just say, "yeah" 
 The strongs do what they want, the weak do what they must 
 I don't give a... they bleed just like us 
 Knock you out your seat, tie you up 
 Metronome Man is going to line you up 
 These clippers, laser beam lyrics for any MC in the presence 
 But I just wanna wet my beak with these bitches 
 If Hip Hop died, the body is energized 
 Then revived beneath the surface of the petrified crimes 
 Create groans from bones in the taxidermy department 
 The side effects is called artistic conflict
