Ono wanna beef with that steam fish? 
 Tell your artist, keep my name out your mouth or you won't have no peace 
 Compared to Canibus your pit bulls are poultry 
 You and Biggie made a dope team, but I'll roast Beans 
 So be careful how you approach things 
 My name ain't J to the mwa, man I got a flow that stings 
 It's rap music, you confuse it if you want to 
 I might still diss you just to see what you gonna do 
 You must be getting insecure or something 
 I'm just admiring your shit man, I ain't gonna touch it 
 I been through a lot of things in my life but I learned from it 
 Put yourself in my shoes, don't I deserve something? 
 The only difference between me and you is a budget 
 Don't make me have to go and sign with Suge or something 
 Remember this, history repeats itself 
 Whenever that never-ending hunger meets itself 
 Everybody want their wealth, peace and health 
 When I was fucked up you didn't give a couple G's to help 
 Did you? No, you waited for my cheese to melt 
 You want all the hot beats and the streets to yourself 
 Well, my patronymic is different enough to attract interest 
 From anybody in the rap business and I'ma get it cash or credit 
 Besides a little drama with my first two records 
 Rip the Jacker's image is unblemished 
 Come on, I wouldn't bite you, I look at you like my dentist 
 I thought you was number one recommended, why you offended? 
 Hip Hop ain't your property, you ain't the only tenant 
 If I win the lottery you can't tell me how to spend it 
 You got something to say don't put your henchmen in it 
 Your little monkey-faced artists that you signed for pennies 
 I refuse to serve them like Denny's, you know they rhymes is petty 
 Don't tell me that your school of Hard Knocks turned preppy 
 None of you mother fuckers know me and you never met me 
 And if my name wasn't shit then you wouldn't sweat me 
 That's absurd right, me getting busy get on your nerves right? 
 You really are listening to the words right? 
 High when I wrote this but sober when I spoke it 
 It's not like I tried to promote it like Jay-O did 
 You notice? Man I was never focused on you 
 I just spit hard on the mic 'cause my shit is hot too 
 I went out and bought your album two times I ain't hating 
 Next thing I know you're talking Jamaican like you're a native 
 But you're really violating, you don't know what you saying 
 Canibus ain't in the game so you know he ain't playing 
 I had nothing before and I have nothing now 
 Fucking with a nigga with nothing only brings you down
