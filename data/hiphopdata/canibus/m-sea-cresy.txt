 (Canibus) 
 Out of the Umbilicus Mundi, 
 This is lyrical lunacy from a human being to speak so fluently, 
 Bars of poetry without precedence, complete par excellence, 
 Listen to the 'Levitibus' testament, 
 To understand me you need help, 
 You've got to see the film 'The Day After Trinity' written by Jon Else, 
 To understand that, you must know thyself, 
 You should keep listening 'cause Canibus' flow might help 
 (Canibus) 
 To find the answers that we didn't know, 
 Maybe Edgar Allen Poe's description of El Dorado is not so, 
 See, the reason there's no light at the end of the tunnel, 
 Is 'cause we're really not in a tunnel we're trapped in a bubble, 
 The government hierarchy and the dregs of society, 
 Can you explain why you believe Hell is fiery? 
 We're suffering from symptoms of drapetomania, 
 Slavery isn't over it just took a new alias, 
 The Data Repository establishment and maintenance, 
 Almost turned me into an atheist scared of aliens, 
 Why write lyrics when I can make a better living, 
 Selling freeze-dried venom to wildlife clinics, 
 'Cause I hate the thought of being a predictable bore, 
 Once you get used to me you won't love me no more, 
 The 'Final Soliloquy of the Internal Paramour', 
 What are we all to do when rap music is gone? 
 I hope "God and the imagination are one", 
 A golden tongue, can achieve synchronicity with the Sun, 
 Transcended beyond the flesh and the blood, 'cause this is level one, 
 After this album my message is done 
 (Canibus) 
 But you can't battle me, so you'd rather embarrass me, 
 I maintain dignity in the face of calamity, 
 They reach out their hand to me and talk dishonestly, 
 But I read through their syntactic structure like Noam Chomsky, 
 A student so overzealous I motivate my trainers, 
 I'd rather get some now than get some later, 
 Take a break from writing rhymes on paper, recondition my character, 
 Change my nature with seven days of Vipassana, 
 Let go of the stress, man I was deeply depressed, 
 So famished, in fact, I needed a rest, 
 To regenerate my mind, 
 Bless the cornerstone of my rhyme with corn, oil and wine, 
 Then see the light in a luminous paradigm, 
 It became more apparent with time, 
 All I had to do was follow the signs, 
 To be a better man I need help, 
 I've just got to find the link between my inner deity and myself
