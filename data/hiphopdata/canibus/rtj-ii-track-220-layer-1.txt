I sit up from upside down while I'm floating around 
 Listen to the glorious sound 
 Gladiators on the ground with maps, the background pitch black 
 I sit in my cave and count bats 
 The black Count Drac via satellite patch 
 We gotta battle night match at the old battle axe 
 200 MCs ready to rap and they rowdy, 
 The airs cloudy, I keep my wits about me, 
 They surround me with a circle of rhymes (circle of rhymes) 
 I disappear into a purple mirage, 
 If Hip Hop is dead then what the fuck are you supposed to do 
 If you're a full fledged hip hop head? 
 Put you to death first then put you in a hearse, 
 Then spit a eulogy verse before I put you in the earth, 
 You don't wanna give the Spitbullz vet respect? 
 Ask your chick, she rub Robitussin on my neck, 
 Air it out like weed smoke, 
 The ceiling fan spin like the motor on a speedboat - increase flow 
 Outdoors I felt breeze blow to the gazebo, 
 Convert the studio for feng shui MC mode 
 Enter the keycode, the light goes from green to gold 
 The beat upload, get ready for the xeno fold flow 
 From out of the wormhole where I barely heard the words that were spoke, 
 RTJ double O 
 These are exo-political lyrical notes, 
 Where there's fire there's smoke after I spit what I've wrote, 
 MCs copy the flow but choke, 
 I think it's so dope to see human folk chase a hoax
