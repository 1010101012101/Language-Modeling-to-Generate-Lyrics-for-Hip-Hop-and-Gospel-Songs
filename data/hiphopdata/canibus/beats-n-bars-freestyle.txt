I've been called stupid, I've been called crazy 
 I've been called lucid, I've been called lazy 
 I've been called a hater, but I like Jay-Z 
 He blaze beats but when I spit the bars, all praise me 
 SpitBoss the name that Hip Hop gave me 
 But after Hip Hop died, Rip the Jacker saved me 
 I look into his eyes, his eyes looked back 
 I stopped in my tracks to ask what you looking at 
 The majority wants peace 
 But cannot peacefully overpower the authority of the beast 
 Innocent lives being crushed from both sides 
 The world of crimes, they are being massaged with lies and left to die 
 So write lightly, when I tell you why it will make sense 
 Proximity explosive devices are inside your pen 
 Different but I'm the same. sometimes I sound same 
 'Cause I'm different, but only when I sit and write lyrics 
 Imagine a world where there are lyrical spirits 
 That spit lyrics, soft whispers from weapons at long distance 
 Of a kind from a force far greater than you'll find 
 The rhymes will enter your mind then energize 
 Where by I continue to rhyme, then I behave cruel to be kind 
 I haven't cared less since '99 
 I write 'cause I want to, I spit 'cause I got to 
 You can do the same thing and nobody can stop you
