(Canibus) 
 Resurrection, introspection, what's the lesson? 
 Let me show you what you been missing 
 I ain't had a beat mellow like this in a while 
 I spit professional style, no question, no doubt 
 Internationally renowned talent 
 Canibus knowledge, solid, stylist hip hop dialect, what you know about it? 
 Spit more verses than a couple hundred thousand 
 Voice box growling, since the first album 
 The eye in the obelisk is watching our consciousness 
 Hip Hop's a flying object, I know how to pilot it 
 Put mask on for oxygen before you try to rhyme like this 
 Red light switch, green light spit 
 Multisyllabic rap savage swinging through the jungles on a vine of language 
 With divine understanding of God's people and God's planet 
 Don't worship the satanic and panic 
 Man up and bang it
