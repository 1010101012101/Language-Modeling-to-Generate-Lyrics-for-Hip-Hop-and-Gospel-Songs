(Canibus) 
 Oh my motherfucking God! Say it ain't so 
 Jesus Christ, my name should be G-Bus Mic 
 Even when I rip the shit, fans leave uptight 
 Can-I-Bus, spit is in my blood, I'm blessed 
 Outside the bones but inside the flesh 
 And yes, if I was focused I could crush you 
 Cause you saying you focused, now how come I can still touch you? 
 I bust you, then spit some Young Buck shit at you 
 'Cause I still got the heart to go bust me a head or two 
 The perfect music machine, mechanical being 
 The most lyrical digital streams the world has ever seen 
 I did, I do, I does, I am 
 I will be, I was the same nigga you love 
 But slugs rain from the sky, it's like the angels want me to die 
 They push me harder 'cause they want me to try 
 A pitbull off the leash, barking speech 
 Like a bull in the pit, lifting you off your feet 
 I feel like the world's mine, I can park in the street 
 Kick the world's illest rhyme, police officers weep 
 People laying on the concrete exhausted from heat 
 Watching John Kerry spit over some Michael Moore beats 
 This is a little something that my repertoire boast 
 I almost was in control of all coasts 
 I give the fans rhymes to quote, they all dope 
 Total lyrical landslide, give me all votes 
 But I can be as quiet as they want me to be 
 Cause even though they say my name, they ain't talking to me 
 They talk to magazines, they talk to MTV 
 They up on 106 on BET talking to Free 
 Big niggaz acting tough, but they walk like their ankles is cuffed 
 Who gives a FUCK if your ankles is buff 
 I can articulate, I wanna participate 
 Cause you can't hold me back with black ball number eight 
 I pick the microphone up and spark the debate 
 Ever since '98 I been a target for hate 
 Jesus Christ! My name should be G-Bus Mic 
 Even when I rip the shit, fans leave uptight 
 Fuck it, I'm in the middle of little Italy 
 With a middleman that didn't know diddly so I killed him lyrically 
 The Big Pun, energy enters me strengthens me 
 Lay you on the floor, shoot you in the back, make you Centipede 
 My sense of speed is ten over three 
 MC times Kay Slay over the motherfucking MP 
 My fanbase sit and wait for the coming 
 They couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug them 
 Yo Kay Slay, can I bust 'em?
