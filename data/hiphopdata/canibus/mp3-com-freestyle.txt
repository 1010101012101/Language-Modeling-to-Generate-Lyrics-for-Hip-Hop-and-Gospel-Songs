Yeah, check it out yo 
 Yeah, check it 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 This is hardcore, out of my heart's core 
 Principles, laws, equations, and formulas drawn on chalkboards 
 Generate thought forms quicker than Concords 
 With onboard computers logged on to On Star 
 En garde, take ten steps and draw 
 I'm the law around these parts, respect it dog 
 Or you might spend a weekend in the county morgue 
 With an unsuitable coffin that's way too small 
 And a deacon blessing your body at a funeral 
 You get a twenty-one blunt salute and life goes on 
 Gotta stay positive focus on the protons 
 And post dope songs on m, p three, dot, com 
 As deep as a Tupac poem, I wish I got to know him 
 Both him and Big Poppa was the greatest, and now they gone 
 'What's Going On?' On my album I'ma do a song 
 Who Shot Ya? Remix featuring Shyne and Sean 
 Before I battle total strangers 
 I make them sign disclaimers, that state they aware of the danger 
 See, I might become overwhelmed with anger 
 Split your skull like a banana, and bludgeon your face with a hammer 
 You wanna rhyme? Fill out this Double-U, nine 
 Sign below the dotted line, now your publishing's mine 
 I gotta have your publishing rights, hang you upside down 
 See if you scared of heights, remember Vanilla Ice? 
 Ask Paradise if I'm nice 
 I took the train to Chambers Street and blacked out on his mixtape twice 
 Back in '95 I was a tiny guy 
 You could see the hunger in my eyes, I just wanted to rhyme 
 And I'm Still in my prime, Still chasing down what's mine 
 Still like Dre, but Jay-Z ain't writing my rhymes 
 Quick to say hi, and quicker to say bye 
 Take a flick with some guys and leave before the Polaroid dries 
 "He was standing here a minute ago," the brother replied 
 "With his mind on his money and his money on his mind" 
 Reflecting over the times when I was signed 
 Selling records for ten dollars, but only a dime was mine 
 What's the odds of rolling two dice with six sides each? 
 As if there's only thirty-six ways to die in these streets 
 There's a million ways to die at the absolute least 
 One of those ways is messing with the Beast from the East 
 A.K.A. me, A.K.A. the capital "C" 
 Ripping the Jacker with Paradise on m, p, three 
 Keep it locked y'all
