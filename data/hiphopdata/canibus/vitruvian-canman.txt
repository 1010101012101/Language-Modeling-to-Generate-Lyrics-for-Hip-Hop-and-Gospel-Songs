(Canibus) 
 Yo, even when I rhyme slow 
 My lyrics move at a high rate of speed 'cause they coming down slow 
 My pantheon stands beyond songs, beyond the norm 
 I've managed to draw the silhouette of God 
 Connect the dots with stars till my C forms 
 In the shape of a deep sea prawn, go to the store 
 Grab the CD without tongs or gloves on 
 And see if it don't barbecue your palms and arms 
 Ambience have a seance in a garden of weed 
 I'm a God, a gardener, a guardian of trees 
 Banana clips and a spliff is all I'ma need 
 I'ma inhale and exhale as long as I breathe 
 Turn the mic on, I'ma torment the beat 
 Tear the club down with a warning and leave 
 Sniff snow in a sauna, up to my knees 
 Conduct business with broads that fuck for the cream 
 Giving angels anal through halos 
 Cause a skinny nigga in a suede robe say so 
 I'm a pimp with a payroll, trying to get paid 
 Worldwide, I'm thinking 'bout hiring some gays 
 I pitch back and forth like a lion in a cage 
 Going out in a blaze, call the fire brigade 
 This is Canibus nigga, fuck what you heard about the name 
 Niggas know the steeze, I tear mics out the frame 
 Who wanna be famous, who's the brainless ignoramus 
 Trying to go against my steel stainless, I'm trained for this 
 How the fuck you gon' be grimy? Your guns is tiny 
 Kill me you gotta deal with a battalion behind me 
 In the center of the circle I stand, it's the Vitruvian Man 
 I'm the illest, truly I am 
 I unzip my own flesh and step out my skin 
 Let you observe my inner being, it's a beautiful thing 
 The intensity in the eyes, the inflection in the rhymes 
 Microscopes couldn't find defects in my design 
 Sometimes I rhyme slow, sometimes I rhyme quick 
 Sometimes I rhyme so long, the listeners quit 
 This the template real emcees should abide by 
 Let me wipe the mucus out the side of your mind's eye 
 Single-handedly carried the torch for ten years 
 With a trojan horse technique, that modern men fear 
 And I never lost a battle motherfucker don't front 
 Maybe on the thirty-second day of the thirteenth month, chump!
