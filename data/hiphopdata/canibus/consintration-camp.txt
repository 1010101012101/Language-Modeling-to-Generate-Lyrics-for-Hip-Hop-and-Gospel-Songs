(Intro: Canibus) 
 Dearly beloved, I gather here today to spit lyrics to the public 
 See if you can fuck with it 
 Concintration Camp here, Canibus in the rear with the other gear 
 Fuck you up in here 
 (Chorus: Canibus) 
 We aim lyrics downrange 
 Grab the microphone if you brave, CnC Squad on the stage 
 Explain, what is Consintration Camp rage? 
 I'ma keep spitting till the world know my name 
 What's your name? CnC Squad on the stage 
 I'ma keep spitting till the world know my name 
 What's your name? CnC Squad on the stage 
 Consintration Camp aim lyrics downrange 
 Concentrate, no matter how much time it take 
 I come correct every rhyme I make 
 So fuck the fame, grab the microphone if you brave 
 Consintration Camp aim lyrics downrange
