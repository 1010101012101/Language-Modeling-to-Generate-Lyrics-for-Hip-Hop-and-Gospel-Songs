(Canibus) 
 Canibus and Ambush vibe 
 Yeah. 
 Directed energy weapon emission downrange 
 Fry brains that remain in anatomy not changed 
 Some consider this preliterate gibberish 
 That very instant they hear this lyricist 
 Einstein was right, but he was wrong about the speed of light 
 He was wrong about the songs that I write 
 Been faster than that before inside the Hip Hop Rap core 
 Battled in arenas as Matador 
 Forced to resign for the force of my rhymes 
 But thought-wise I was just before my time 
 It has come and passed, I still put that fire to the gas 
 You still see the flash when I blast 
 Rollover clash, everybody out, I get out last 
 Signal my hand, we spread out fast 
 Forty pounds heavier, the more rounds the merrier 
 The Pit Bull Terrier terrorist clearing the area (area) 
 (Ambush: And just when you thought it was over) 
 Hyena on the tiger leash biting the beast 
 Trying to eat, the mouth haven't even learned how to speak 
 Nice to see you, how you been? How to greet 
 I'm sorry the industry code of the streets, is poorly out of reach 
 The body in the trunk smell rotten from the funk 
 Got the cops down at the dump, rummaging through the junk 
 While I ride around and stunt with gun, body armor and a blunt 
 I won't take it if you offer what I want 
 The jungle is humble, the desert becomes you 
 Wake up youth, they both wanna take life from you 
 A ravenous man called Javelin Fangz 
 Cadavers on the back of the tank drag as they hang 
 We vibing in here. 
 (Ambush: And just when you thought it was over) 
 Yeah, yeah.
