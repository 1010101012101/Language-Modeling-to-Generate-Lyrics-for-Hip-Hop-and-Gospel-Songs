Yo, I do thumb push ups till hands numb 
 Then I get in the club, they ban the rum 
 Crush rapper groups this how cloak N dagga do 
 After this reboot, we emcee Proof 
 Rhymes on deck, check the chart specs 
 Light your ass up, it ain't even dark yet 
 Its hard to digest high-tech rhyme specs 
 Design techs ain't seen nothin' like mine yet 
 Great, got the last crate, motor voice box in stock 
 Since you want that I give you what I got 
 We stand by the burn-barrel 
 Tryin' to stay warm and act natural 
 Soldiers do what they have to 
 Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, C 
 I sing it to myself till I fall asleep 
 Walkin' is restricted, everybody crawl or creep 
 There's been a sniper on the loose for a week 
 Park my striker on the street, 
 Open the hatch, stand on the seat 
 Catch an RPG with my teeth 
 Where for art thou noble emcee 
 We seek, your blood we drink your flesh we eat 
 Too strong, the unicorn with bull-horns 
 Destroy a million, civilian new cars 
 Bite the flesh out the beast neck like T-Rex 
 With mint-meats a row of teeth three feet thick 
 Sleepless nights, bed-less sleeps 
 My belief is anything with teeth got the right to eat 
 A-Yo dagga, the beat sick talk that street shit 
 When the jeeps on the strip pussy meet dick 
 Satellites watch me they think they got me 
 Right hands turn left shoulders around but it's not me 
 What up Papi? Shot up on the block, cocky 
 In hotels my cloak drag across the lobby 
 Pick the beat up on my back my knees crack 
 Muh-fuka we the sickest emcees in rap 
 Cloak And Dagga that! 
 Scatter raps across the map 
 It's like that!
