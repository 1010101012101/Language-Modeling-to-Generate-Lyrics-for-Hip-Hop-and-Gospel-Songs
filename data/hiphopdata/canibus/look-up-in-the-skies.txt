(Presto) 
 Lyrical geophysicist, postmodern henotheistic 
 Neolithic astrotheologian visionist 
 Indigenous images with ancient depictions of futuristic missions 
 Translated Sumerian like Sitchin did 
 Dualism diminishes through cognitive dissonance 
 The difference is I could split these niggas wigs in an instant kid 
 Rockin' technology, verbal bionic biology 
 Tectonic anomalies expose masonic symbology 
 2012 prophecies, topics on the gospel of Thomas 
 And Enoch and sacred geometry 
 Nigga I'll test ya', wrestle ya' ass in cage like Nicholas 
 The modern day Nikola Tesla 
 My hollow tips'll bless ya', push keys like John Tesh 
 Verbal turrets, niggas is under pressure 
 Tex mex like I'm sending text messages to every Mexican in Texas 
 North American union is imminent 
 (Canibus) 
 This rag's for scrubbing your asshole not mine 
 For the last time your the asshole in my rhymes 
 Look up in the sky, die! 
 I'm a thirty thousand foot ocean wave snatching planes out the sky 
 Fuck the day Tesla discovered the Death Ray 
 My legs got replaced by two miniature segways 
 Try to escape, smack face into a fire escape 
 I can relate, try something else, just don't try it too late 
 You can't overpower him, he's 33 times your weight 
 He spit 33 rhymes in one place 
 Want respect line up next, catch metaphor wreck 
 The sound of my voice come from the core of my chest 
 Room tempt so cold it is hot 
 No matter how much it feels like home, you should know it is not 
 The mental of the orchestral vessel, not even tryna stress you 
 I rhyme like this 'cause it's simple 
 Supine suplex disconnect spine from neck 
 Whatever it takes to make you rhyme less 
 Picture this, been a lyricist 
 But I was scorn by a society of preliterate degenerates 
 This beat make you mad at me, fuck Bobby McFerrin for 'being happy' 
 Fuck you for giving him the Grammy 
 The song he wrote, you might wanna sing it note for note 
 If you can follow the flow, the monotone glow monochrome 
 Fuck that, I rap autotune, automatated Boom Bap boom 
 Face recognition hardware zoom 
 Face recognition software, identify if you are bald head or long hair 
 Through several atmosphere's, yeah, look up in the skies 
 (Sick Since) 
 When you fools gonna learn 
 Sick Since and Canibus and Presto will kick rhymes to change the world 
 The Aristotle models configure to model hell 
 The Nephilim follow the comet through microgenetic silos 
 Sound cracks the outer space transmission 
 The integration only come from divine intervention 
 The similar mission only in post beta phase 
 The mental energy will turn it into stellar waves 
 Harmonic alchemy, call it the master stage 
 I hear the tones of consciousness I wake up and try to explain 
 I am on a higher plane The rap version of Raptor 
 The virtual rapture blood thirsty raptors with sharpened talons 
 The plants will leave the planet, I speak universal dimension 
 The constellations still rotating with this sentence 
 The choppers are being played to blaze weight 
 Incarcerating Pagans, audacity is breaking
