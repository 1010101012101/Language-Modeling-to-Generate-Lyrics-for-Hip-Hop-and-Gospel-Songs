 United by the love of hip-hop, tighter than zip-locks 
 Watch the way Kamnouze and Canibus rock

 Yo 
 I blow mics out of orbit 
 The illest nigga to talk on a recording since rap started 
 Touch your territory and get a shorty to translate the language for me 
 To make sure that you can't ignore me 
 For all the king's horses, and all the king's men 
 Probably didn't know that this nigga could speak French 
 Hence, I adapt to my surroundings 
 Canibus got a million and one styles and still counting 
 The black Jesus, speaks will leave you speechless 
 Move mountains two centimetres with telekinesis 
 The beast from the east is ripping jackers to pieces 
 You geezers can't fuck with my thesis, I'm the deepest 
 Needless to say, I sound like I spit without breathing 
 Your rhyme sounds decent, but you suck like leeches 
 You sound ass, meaning, the gluteus maximus region 
 My equilibrium large, medium

 United by the love of hip-hop, tighter than zip-locks 
 Watch the way Kamnouze and Canibus rock

 Yo 
 My tongue will slice you eight ways like pizza 
 Seasoning with parmesan cheese, drink two litres of gasoline 
 Turn into a fire-breather 
 Release a heat that can baffle a heat seekers' thermal meters 
 Feel your forehead to see if you got a fever, before I eat you 
 I'm hotter than sleeveless minks on demons, nigga believe it 
 Set fire to the Garden of Eden for my freedom 
 Spit a hundred meaningless bars for no reason 
 And start weeping, I get labelled dyslexic by my English teacher 
 'Cause it comes out (A) 
 No matter how I read it, it's just the way I see shit 
 There ain't an emcee on the planet who could see this 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 My freestyle is so sharp, niggas think it's prewritten 
 My brain is like a hard-drive CD spinning 
 Ain't no mother fucker ill like me 
 I stopped fucking for six months to build my chi
