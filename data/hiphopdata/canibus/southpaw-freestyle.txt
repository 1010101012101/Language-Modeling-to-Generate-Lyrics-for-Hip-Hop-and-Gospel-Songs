(Canibus) 
 I'm the black mutant of rap music, half human half Vladimir Putin 
 After plasma transfusion I became Rasputin 
 The master of translucence who lives in a green house 
 Creatin' green gas pollution, smoking hash from hookahs 
 Before Lucifer sent me back to the future to smash computers 
 Assassinate classes of students, I spare those who show classic improvement 
 Produce magik acoustics, supreme music using dreams so lucid 
 I can visualize my future and chose it, I never abuse it 
 I'm ruthless but Canibus is super illumine 
 You know what? I read the blueprint 
 Sometimes it seems like my eyes are wide shut like Stanley Kubrick 
 Mic Club the Curriculum II, 
 I changed the name 'cause I ain't in business no more with you-know-who 
 He stole from Killah Priest too, his name rhymes with Clue 
 I found out the same time as you, 
 You know what happens when you come from dishonest roots 
 You put roots on me, I put roots on you 
 "We live in a free country" 
 That phrase is so fucking funny, we know freedom is based off the money 
 Resources to hide behind lawyers, it must be lovely 
 When nobody can touch your lunch meat 
 We brainwashed, we can't get these white collar stains off 
 Poor Bernard Madoff belongs in the graveyard 
 The stock market trade off doesn't pay off 
 We get laid off, the country spirals into chaos 
 I'm no genius, I know enough not to trust FEMA 
 Their vaccines give ya eczema of the penis 
 The Tuskegee Jesus verses a sneaky Tuskegee Demon 
 What you gon' do when you see this?! 
 The oldest religions, the coldest magicians 
 Transmitting live from Hell with heat stroke symptoms
