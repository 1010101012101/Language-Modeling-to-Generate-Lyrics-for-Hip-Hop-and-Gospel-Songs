 Hot lyrics, loop the beat and rock with it 
 Go ahead, slam the door in my face; I'll locksmith it 
 My box cutter blades rip it, toxidic 
 The Luftwaffe for lyrics when the spit-fire spit it 
 Put a high-spin on the electrons limit like cricket googol boulders 
 Hitting the wicked 
 Get Jig, fix my appearance, take you to Paris 
 Cook dinner on a terrace for you and your parents 
 First impression what they think of me? Don't they like monogamy? 
 Won't let you commit to me? Tell them that you live with me 
 Tell them I dig you out diligently 
 And you thinking about giving up everything so you can have twins with me 
 Turbo nine, eleven, eighty-nine degree weather intertwine as I push the leather 
 Pin you to the leather 
 I prove I can love you better in three seconds 
 So let me pull over and check your P.S.I pressure

 New and improved updated sex pistols, clamp your nipples 
 The B.D.S. symbol leave your kitty crippled 
 Cherry pickers lift you, flip you like a nickel 
 Scream the safe-word girl, I'ma keep whipping you 
 Eyes wide shut the word is Fidelio 
 With R. Kelly showing his home amateur video 
 Produced by a pinto at the house 
 The custodian of records is me not (E) 
 The best job in the world besides touring around 
 With Jagged Edge, is something with hoes' whoring around 
 Rhythm and Blues get all the couscous no doubt 
 And when I'm singing R and B this is how it sounds 
 Young lady you look so fine 
 I can't turn my eyes away, the way you look in the lingerie 
 Got bitches? Yeah

 She make me want it in her mouth 
 With her tah-tah's busting out, show her what's love about 
 Spend the budget and bounce 
 Yo, and even though she going down south it don't count 
 'Cause I never met a stripper that respected her spouse 
 Beat her ass as soon as she step in the house 
 What she expect? She's kissing him with D.N.A. we left in her mouth 
 She blaming it on the drugs and the wine 
 Club seen is obscene I told you umpteen times 
 She want to be an actress, why you proud of her? 
 Ain't shit change but the dick sliding in and out of her 
 Ain't nobody looking out for her 
 The appointment with the casting coach counselor is really just about a nut 
 Ain't no photographer taking no snapshots of her 
 With no cardboard camera for no twenty dollars 
 Why that bitch telling you she got the part? 
 She got spit starch on somebody's boxer shorts, you heard? 
 Got bitches? Yeah 
 Where can I get them?
