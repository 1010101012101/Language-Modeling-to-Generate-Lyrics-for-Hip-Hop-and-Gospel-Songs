(Canibus) 
 Yo, 
 I can kick a freestyle any time you demand it 
 Brain's high-density and my memory is expanded 
 Breaking sound barriers like the Lockheed 
 Even with knock-knees I run across rough terrain at Mach speed 
 Barefoot, Canibus is crazy enough 
 Genetically engineering eight-leaved clovers for twice the luck 
 Canibus is my name, play the freestyle game 
 Physical brain is in better shape than Jack La Lanne 
 While you sit and wonder how I just took the life of another 
 Me and my brother jump in the Jeep and burn rubber 
 Go to my mothers, switch cars, that was clever 
 She said, "Son, I love ya', but they gonna handcuff ya'" 
 Cold War veteran, used to assemble weapons for the Kremlin 
 Disciplined like Olympic gold medalists 
 Remember this, never ever chick protection-less 
 'Cause nowadays what you can catch is very infectious 
 Unless you got a death wish and you want to mess with 
 Women who poison the walls of their wombs with asbestos 
 These streets is treacherous, listen to me when I tell you this 
 Whatever you trying to buy somebody is selling it 
 Somewhere, somehow you get gunned down 
 When the guns go blow, just 'cause you was running your mouth 
 All my people in Toronto sayin' "no doubt" 
 You a punk, stop fronting and put the gat down 
 Kick a rap now, let me see if you can freestyle 
 Throw on the DAT now, let me show you how to blackout 
 Next year you be walkin' 'round the 'How Can I Be Down?' conference with a laminate 
 That says, "I got played out by Canibus"
