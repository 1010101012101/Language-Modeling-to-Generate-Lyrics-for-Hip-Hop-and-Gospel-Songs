(Kurupt) 
 The stampede begins, nigga 
 The year 2002 (Horsemen), alert, let everybody know 
 When it came, it spread nigga 
 Yeah, Horsemen, Horsemental, Horsemen instrumental 
 Horsementality, Horsemen procedures 
 Horsemen spread like a rash of legions 
 Multiply like multiplication 
 Equivalent to the equation or combination 
 Rewind the phrases (nigga) 
 Complex puzzles amazes, launch off missiles and lasers 
 Gorillas, dunn, muscled the homies out of the cages 
 Seperating ligaments like caves and gauges 
 Don't compliment niggaz, I collapse niggaz 
 I don't cooperate nigga, I don't concentrate niggaz 
 I eliminate niggaz, Horsemental state niggaz 
 Which gets me in a mental state to earthquake niggaz 
 Touch niggaz, decompose niggaz 
 The Headless Horseman, we growl, decompose niggaz 
 (Chorus w/ ad-libs: Kurupt) 
 We don't give a fuck 
 We don't give a fuck 
 We don't give a fuck 
 We don't give a fuck 
 (Kurupt) 
 Stampede stopping, dropping, spitting toxic 
 Horsemen stopping, dropping verbal monsters 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Niggaz sage and pass, look fast and keep mashing 
 Bitches wave your hands, shake ass, and keep dancing 
 The diary of a ogre, vulgar 
 Fuck snake skin belts, hold my pants up with a a live cobra 
 Grew up, now I'm older 
 Life ain't shit, my fights, flossing and Folger's 
 Wake up and smell the coma, aroma 
 Only reason you ain't sucking my dick now is under exposure 
 Trying to sneak my way to top and fuck Oprah 
 Battlefields Earth with John John Travolta's 
 Send aliens to smoke ya 
 Fuck fatty, I'm trifiling and petty nigga 
 I wear your rent in my left ear already 
 Life in the Serengeti, y'all low on the food chain 
 Chameleon man change colours like a mood ring 
 Assonine in half the time under cover 
 Fuck you, your lesbian lover and your mother with the same rubber 
 Ras is Pestilence, middle fingers in the sky 
 Niggaz rep this shit, come on 
 (Ras Kass) 
 HRSMN, Horsmen, walkin' all you forty six and spit abortion 
 (Canibus) 
 Meanwhile, back at the barracks 
 Horsemen rip jackers for plasters 
 Put bodies in coffins and autograph us 
 This is the headquarters for horses 
 Dip the pork sausage in four different kind of Tabasco sauces 
 Take a bite out of it, stick my hand up my own ass 
 And pull a mic out of it, to see how hype the crowd will get 
 Turn the monitors up, I wanna see how loud it could get 
 A Horseman's about to spit 
 Wack MC's, they shouldn't be allowed to live 
 String 'em up, make an accordion out of they ribs 
 Get the keys to the house, move the shit out they crib 
 Trade faces with them, go home, fuck the shit out they wiz 
 Find a daycare center, beat the shit out they kids 
 Beat sulphuric acid out of your piss, bash your face in with a brick 
 You jacker, you just got ripped 
 Keep talking shit, see what I respond with 
 Tiger bone tonic, vomit, turn your face into a eyes, nose, ears, and lip 
 Omelette 
 Think about that concept, motherfucker 
 (Canibus) 
 We the Horsemen motherfucker, don't forget it 
 Waving the double edged sword, nigga we said it 
 We the Horsemen 
 (Kurupt) 
 Yeah niggaz, poetical demon skills 
 Sharp as meat cleavers, together forever 
 Spitting like baby berettas, motherfucker 
 (Killah Priest) 
 Bitch niggaz don't stand near me 
 Y'all gonna feel my fury, yo, this is Horsemen theory 
 Horsemen, four men, eight arms like the spider 
 Spray fire, lead slingers 
 Make webs around the heads of niggaz 
 Cockroaches come crawling out of they eyes 
 Beetles and worms eating up they insides 
 My tarot cards don't lie, put a curse on you 
 Like the Guru, black magic, voodoo 
 It's purple smoke, your arms come out 
 Grabbing you, push, blast through, your forehead 
 I'm the body in the glass tomb, they call dead 
 After I open my eyes, then here come the rises of my horses 
 Bodies burning in torment, torches those who want it 
 Yo, y'all wanna battle? In my image I cast a shadow 
 That resembles a Pharaoh, I'm Priest 
 A Horsemen nigga, Horsemen apparel 
 (Outro: Kurupt) 
 Psycho like no bitch-ass niggaz. 
 Ambush, nigga 
 Canibus... Kurupt... Killah Priest... Ras... Kass 
 Innate... bitch...
