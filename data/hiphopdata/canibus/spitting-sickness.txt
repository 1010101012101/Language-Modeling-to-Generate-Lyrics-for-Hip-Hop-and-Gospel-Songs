(Canibus) 
 You know an emcee, send him to me 
 I ain't never met another nigga better than me 
 Inner luxury naked, there is no thought this sacred 
 There is no force to save him 
 Silent Buck Rogers floating in space subconscience 
 Your knowledge is nothing but nonsense 
 The concept _____ political process 
 This is not a lyrical contest 
 Yo, fatidical flow, ____ engine cylinder grows 
 Some visuals show, I scribble some notes 
 Degrees decrease as soon as the signature of the heat decode 
 _______ Froze, my crystal is broke 
 ____ Of sound and circuit round a personal crown 
 Believe me it's more worse than it sounds 
 If the testimony dimensional genetics 
 Connecting my spiritual past to my spiritual present 
 The sentence, back in the saddle ready to battle 
 Climbing and cackle, the rap skill level is supernatural 
 I'll rap you, wrap you ____ 
 As soon as you come to confess in the chapel, I attack you 
 The whole congregation laugh at, this rap fool 
 Paranoid Chillin' with an attitude 
 You want a lesson then book the session 
 Canibus, Zambo, Sick Since no question
