(Canibus) 
 These lyrics are so cataclysmic 
 Consecrate the spirit, time and space within it 
 The hours become minutes whenever I spit it 
 When I bust, I said fuck it, the Brotherhood got me covered 
 Motivated by the starts and I bust a 100 Bars 
 You didn't think before you walked as far away as AGCR 
 You will be detained in the black list registry 
 If you question me and you try to clone, e lyrically 
 Advanced step in systemic Neo-synapsis, 
 Notice I spit it rapid with my cryptic language 
 Until I build my Machine, Rip spit bananas 
 You will become acquainted with my mystic manners 
 When I rhyming like this, these rappers are worth shit 
 Rip spit from the spirit, you better be feeling this 
 I don't need no help but, I turned up stoned as fuck 
 The mucus dried up but, tell me this poem is luck 
 Your girl Gertrude don't wanna have to hurt you dude (fuck you) 
 She better do it, I promised my servitude 
 If I am not myself tell me how will I see? 
 If I do not look bitch, then how will I be? 
 Searching for the ritual widow urgently 
 Observing me perform surgery will be the streets of New Jersey, capturing taxidermy 
 I put her on Cloud Nine, look at her face 
 A cumulus lenticularis a capsule in space 
 (Chorus 2X: Holocaust) 
 'We Are All Well Known', a mountainous microphone 
 An apple that came from Rome might bite and snap your bones 
 I'm The Holocaust, the Colossus, now the Apocalypse 
 Back from the territories of darkness with a gun heartless 
 (The Holocaust) 
 Down in the valley there are machines, they are Indians 
 Because I move a stone your jaw gets swollen, unfriendly like a Mole-Man 
 Dumb blotch, I never blend in, when I rhyme 
 You're looking at a pirate's emblem, the ghost of Humphrey Bogart 
 William Satire in an oil drab world, I run water in my eyes to cry 
 My button on the side, Long John shirt from 1805 
 I'm live, there is a woman she kills a rat 
 She lives in a house on the hillside 
 Jesse James was a desperado, he was shot in the back of his head 
 A five o'clock shadow, dirty faced clown leaves you dead 
 In the Gothic metropolis of the West it's Holocaustalic, I'm the best 
 As far as dropping it, toxic neurologist 
 Now of the Apocalypse, throw a gun 
 Some kind of a man who tried to civilize the human family throughout the populace 
 This is Warpath, the Green Lantern boxes out lantern jaw 
 With a gun, I wander the mountain side, Starman 
 One time my spine was broken in half like Batman 
 The Headless Horsemen, you flap scan 
 And you find yourself in a blue world and die again from a gun in my hand 
 You all burst into water like a bubble 
 A Hawaiian katana blade slaughters bookbinder cobbler 
 Fire is an element belonging to water 
 (The Holocaust) 
 The Egyptian beetles eat you scandalous on a lethal ice planet 
 There is a praying mantis, rap bastard shit 
 Scenes of Atlantis, punch you and bust your fucking bandages 
 I came from the dark city of Los Angeles 
 Actually a city built under Jack Sprat, dark monarch Thundercat 
 Spray you for the Taylor's valor, Dracula spear, this impaler 
 Red, white, blue Indian paint lightsaber 
 (Canibus) 
 You say I'm crazy I say so, Tell me something I don't know 
 Something my psych profile doesn't show 
 I don't have all the answers I am not in the know 
 I can only see what is above and only from below 
 Substratum of reality, through the thick cloud canopy 
 How can it me Canibus? Answer me, bitch niggas 
 (The Holocaust) 
 Clever the man, he is a barbarian, he lives in the hillside 
 He thinks he will live forever, feathers in the hood 
 An aircraft bomber jacket made of leather 
 From the nether world, a bullet hurled putrid 
 A gun in the alternate future is my weapon that severs 
 But in rhyme you could never get your varsity letter 
 Nevertheless, dark side, interstellar 
 (The Holocaust) 
 The arsonist who has become a patriarch in the dark from arsenic 
 To steal a book from the market, and later burn a barn down, anarchist 
 The redeemer and a marksmen 
 You walk, 'Johnny Talk' with a gun in your back often 
 (Canibus) 
 Dig a hole for the collateral carnage, battle the hardest 
 Take out Hip Hop's trash and garbage 
 My lyrical is chemical radioactive residue 
 I can't rest until I accomplished what I was sent to do 
 My thoughts graduated to the stars, listen to the bars
