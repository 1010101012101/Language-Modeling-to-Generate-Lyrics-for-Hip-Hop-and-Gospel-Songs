(Killah Priest) 
 My lyrics takes off, expand like the wings of a hawk 
 Pen form a beak, when I speak, I'ma thought 
 Third eye, moves like a bird when it flies 
 Self like the stealth, unheard through the sky 
 Undetected by the naked eye, only few could catch it 
 The second that the message arrive 
 For some it might blow by 
 Only for the dumb, deaf, and the blind 
 Searching depths for the mind 
 Connect with a line, illuminate communicate 
 With the concepts of my rhyme, come on 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Every sixth day I commit suicide 
 This nigga rapping a clue, check the dots under my eye 
 Horsemen, equestrian, conquest we in 
 No vest come and test me then 
 Hit 'em up like a upper cut 
 I'm trying to hit mach-ten on my fucking twin, buckle up 
 By any means dog, I'ma take these ends 
 'Cause if you don't got cheddar, you just a waste of skin 
 All up in the juice and can't taste the gin 
 Commit the felony, but can't face the pen' 
 Speak on it if you want if, if you get it illegal then don't flaunt it 
 Cause loud mouth hustlers get snitched on it 
 Or phone tapped by DA, your rights get read 
 Moral of the story, a closed mouth don't get fed 
 Get it, never been a nigga as ill as me to riddle 
 I'm the truth and the answer with two balls that always double dribble 
 Spit like Alien 3, and splash you 
 With acid that make me greater than thee 
 Just to leave your gutter red 
 Tony Soprano shit bout to start calling you niggaz butter heads 
 (All) 
 We are not to be fucked wit 
 (Chorus 2X: Killah Priest) 
 If y'all really wanna flow, take advice from the four 
 First step could be the best, take breath control 
 Then let yourself go, once applied with sound 
 Melodies make music surround 
 (Canibus) 
 Excuse me, yo, Horseymen? 
 You're the Horseymen, Horsemen, oh yeah I seen them 
 Look what I did with a mouth and a pen 
 I bet y'all critics never doubt me again 
 Try to catch the thoughts that come out of my head 
 Look south of my chest and north of my legs 
 If you good with metaphors, then you saw what I said 
 If not, too late, you're already wet 
 Of course we the best 
 And I'm a quarter in the Horsemen quartet, put us all to the test 
 Canibus is like God in the flesh 
 If the Lord is distrempt, you got a problem to fix 
 I mean what are the odds you could out spit Bis? 
 Especially if he could bounce like this 
 He's possessed when he's on the microphone 
 He takes this more serious than just a poem 
 A bad boy to the bone, true superstar 
 Even before Sean John Jr. was born 
 I ripped a 100 Bars before 
 And I rip 200 if you motherfuckers wanna see more 
 Death and War, Pestilence to keep the pesticides airborne 
 Kurupt get your head on 
 (Chorus 3X - with echoes/adlibs)
