Yo 
 My style of rhymin' is ancient like Aztecs and Mayans 
 100 bars is still a good yard sale item (get em'!) 
 Nobody can touch Can-I-Bus lyrically 
 Take you out back put you outta' ya' misery 
 Drag you back inside, potato sack over the head 
 Surprise! I try to apologize with a rhyme 
 I know how it starts, I know how it ends 
 My tombstone says "Don't believe me I'm dead" 
 Shadow behind the curtain in the window 
 Spittin' to the instrumental 
 Watch what I'm about to get into 
 Always at odds, they try to sabotage my bars 
 There's no rap law that says I can't rhyme how I want 
 You don't like the flow? You don't like the language 
 What's your explanation? Where are your manners? 
 Why you on my dick 'cause my name is Canbius 
 Shut the fuck up and go make a sandwich 
 Invulnerable rap, throw vocals all over the track 
 Don't get attached to that emotional crap 
 Stop frontin' microphone ain't plugged in or nothin' 
 How you gon' be up an' comin'? 
 When you down in the dungeon blunted talkin' 'bout nothin' 
 An' all that paper you touchin' 
 There's a global depression you dummy! 
 A bible in your hotel 
 But you still goin' to hell 
 You got drugs? Then you goin' to jail 
 It's that old fashioned classic, flow fantastic 
 True lyrics is spittin' the new stimulus package 
 It's that old fashioned classic, flow fantastic 
 Canibus and Chopp got that new stimulus package 
 Lyricism about speech 
 Broken down to different sounds compliance all around 
 Do you know how many times they asked me "How many rhymes?" 
 How many rhymes memorized plus those set aside... 
 E coli, eyes so swollen and dry it hurts to cry 
 You are waiting for the moment to die 
 Winchester Williams spit silent winded 
 Try lyrical fitness, grab the mic like a style molester 
 Talk sex to sister with my finger on the Twitter 
 How the fuck you know you ain't talkin' to a nigga? 
 *Scratched* I rock till I can't rock no-more
