(Sample from Tim Westwood interview: Eminem) 
 "If you're an MC and you mention my name in the wrong way 
 You draw first blood, I'm gonna come at you" 
 Kuniva: 
 War Lab, call us haters all you want 
 Fuck it call me a hater, full blown instigator 
 Leavin' niggas on intubators breathin like Darth Vader 
 I hate people that pack guns but they don't bust 'em 
 Or bitches that come back to my room but they ain't fuckin' 
 Pistol clutchin, the Dozen, you heard it don't get is misconstrued 
 Whatever we do'll hit the news once we get the tools 
 (Samples: Eminem) 
 You're an emcee and you mention my name 
 In the wrong way, and you draw first blood, I'm comin' 
 Canibus: 
 You pushed D-12 to the side to sign Voltron 5 
 If Proof was alive he'd be dyin' inside 
 You ain't no hip-hop messiah, you a bitch, 'cause you dissed Mariah 
 Shit like that supposed to be private 
 I'm a fry you on behalf on Mariah and Michael 
 Put you back on them drugs, make you suicidal 
 You can't shut the record down, nigga it's vival 
 When you use the word 'nigga', just remember your idols 
 DZK: 
 I got a question, I'm white, can I join D12? 
 I'll sell you four million records then I'll tell you go to hell 
 Leave Swifty in charge, then remove all the stars 
 And make the group wish Bizarre shot pool in a bar 
 An assault lawyer stop the beat, suing us all 
 I really do hope you know who get involved 
 'Cause I'm a fan and I'll get you for a Nick Cannon dissin 
 And you already know how fuckin' sick Canibus is 
 Swifty: 
 I hate a bitch-ass nigga just as much as I hate fags 
 I love goin' to war but I hate when they raise the flag 
 These niggas hittin the streets spittin' venom on me 
 Then start renegin the beef, I hate peace treaties 
 Forever yo' enemy I increase beef as Amityville's finest 
 'Cause I don't believe in stoppin' violence 
 I'm a tyrant that'll snatch my respect and scram 
 I use a uzi 'cause I hate a Tec when it jams 
 I hate when dudes treat this like life a movie 
 Usin' rap as his excuse to do shit and they only move ki's in the booth 
 I piss on niggas hands, whoever's grown, patches and tombstones 
 I hate 'em ass when I break into a home 
 I'm barefaced, I clap your cat, ramsack it 
 That's what I'm wearin black and I hate goin' out the back 
 So call me a hater, walkin' detonator, I ain't afraid 
 To stick this blade into your fade in front of spectators 
 (Samples: Eminem) 
 You're an emcee, big small it doesn't matter 
 No matter how big I get, I just want people to know 
 Canibus: 
 You the devil in a red dress on MTV 
 You sign more black people than a basketball team 
 What sou trying to say subconsciously? You can't rock the beat like me 
 Consciously you know I rock you to sleep 
 Slim Shady you a coward 'cause you scared to rap with me 
 The only black man you respect is 50 
 And the greatest of all time was dead right 
 You dead wrong, you shouldn't have even be on that song 
 DZK: 
 He fell off so hard this faggot broke his accent 
 I'm flippin through the channels seein Bruno get his ass sniffed 
 And I'm disgusted man, what the fuck is wrong with you? 
 Why'd you date Mariah? Mariah's not a fuckin' dude 
 You never even saw her nude and you busted two 
 Must have been thinkin' 'bout your stepdad touchin you 
 But that ain't nothin' new, I asked your ugly crew 
 They verified it, so bitch quit lyin' 
 Canibus: 
 I remember the first time we met, I ain't even liked you 
 Walkin' around my vido set like you was in high school 
 It must excite you seeing black people being tribal 
 That's why Dr. Dre signed you 
 I bet you right now you got a big rotten Rosenberg beside you 
 Trying to be just like your father, inside you 
 Your Stan android fanboys need to kill that noise 
 I know what you thinking... kill that boy 
 DZK: 
 We leavin' Elvis funny money makin' pelvis shattered 
 Let's see you square dance now, let's see you hold your bladder 
 Let's see you fire back Em where's the fire at it? 
 Suicide hotline time, go dial that 
 Put on that "8 Mile" hat and write a vile track 
 Get at some people that can actually diss you back 
 No more target practice on retarded actors 
 And pop stars, Marshall you're not hard 
 (Samples: Eminem) 
 Whatever happens to me in this game 
 I've always got my ear to the street 
 Canibus: 
 Rengade Schemenegade, you pink like lemonade 
 I've been better than you before Genesis was made 
 You ain't better than Black Thought, you ain't better than Mos Def 
 You ain't better than Canibus, Professor Griff Hotep 
 So renegade Schemenegade, you pink like lemonade 
 I penetrate through Hailey's Comet with metal blades 
 Yeah! You and I both know why I'm saying this 
 I hope Whoo Kid get fired for playing this 
 Bizarre: 
 Get off, Nikolai Volkoff, mazeltov 
 Ready to show off, fo'-fo'll blow your do' off 
 Blowin' off steam, goin' off the beam 
 Let the 9 sing, Biz ain't a dream 
 Bitch I'm the king, color me bad 
 Skinny jeans, what happened to the sag? You makin' me mad 
 Y'all a bunch of JJ Fags, now who the fuck is bad? 
 Motherfucker I'm bad! 
 Call me a hater
