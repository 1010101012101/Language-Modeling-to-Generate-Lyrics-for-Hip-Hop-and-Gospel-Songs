(Chorus: Canibus) 
 Religion is the producer on the ones and twos 
 Canibus the Dreamcatcher, just for you 
 Religion is the producer on the ones and twos 
 Dangerous the Dreamcatcher, just for you 
 (Canibus) 
 The Dreamcatcher, Dangerous rappers 
 Content be out of context for the masses 
 Hard body hardware, trigger happy, half-wit Vernacular Gymnastics 
 Exemplary balance, notwithstanding my talent 
 No desire for power, hypnotize minds 
 Through an eye on the album, heart rate slow down some 
 My thoughts are supreme, I hawk tie my dreams 
 Then line them up together, try to see what they mean 
 It all comes back to the same theme, I'm a Microphone Fiend 
 You just standing in-between what I need 
 I am free, but only for a moment on the M-I-C 
 All systems tryna track my ID 
 Dangerous forefather Poor Pauper emcee 
 For the past month he's been suspended in part three 
 I see both Devil and God agree nobody rhyme like me 
 Microphones explode under attack by PicoScopic drones 
 Communicate through _________ phones transmutant tones 
 Soundwaves crash through stone 
 Including human bones sewn to my zone 
 Dreamcatcher Canibus, Dangerous now you know 
 Get ready, get, set, go, respected over the globe 
 For verbal kinetic soul or ultramagnetic flow 
 Get ready, get, set go, respected over the globe 
 For verbal kinetic soul or ultramagnetic flow
