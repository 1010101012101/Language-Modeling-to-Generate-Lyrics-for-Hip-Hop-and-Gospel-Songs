Five mercs, blow tide, high surf in the dirt 
 We curse and burp like Wyatt Earp 
 Can't sleep, feel pain but can't weep 
 DC got the M3P on full sweep 
 Outside the wire, flat tire fuel truck on fire 
 A 180 days to retire 
 KBR first 80k tax free 
 Escalade upgrade, one IED from the grave 
 Once a day I drink Gatorade in the shade 
 Special Ed plays I got it made 
 The guy who tried to shoot me looked like Gary Busey 
 The whole troop salute me, the news interviewed me 
 I write under chem lights same color tent types 
 The pen tip strikes the mic burst into light 
 I lowered the ramp, seen a soldier standin' there in a stance 
 With dry hemoglobin on his pants 
 Low pressure suppressors sound like twin engine Cessnas 
 Probably settle Wachowski "vendettas" 
 Pay for your sins, you got the Benz 
 But no matter how it ends I'd do it all again 
 I paid for your sins, you got the Benz 
 But no matter how it ends I'd do it again
