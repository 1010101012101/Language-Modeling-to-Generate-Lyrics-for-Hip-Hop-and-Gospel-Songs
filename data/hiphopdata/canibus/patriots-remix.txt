 I go to war 
 I keep it raw 
 I go hard 
 I go to war 
 I spar 
 I keep it raw 
 I go hard 
 (Canibus) 
 I make your weak crew release stool 
 I put a pistol in your mouth and pull, then I feed you to the pit-bulls 
 Don't even talk about guns 
 The only nine you got, is a five dollar bill and four ones 
 So I don't really care what y'all hypenoholics say 
 Because anything that can't penetrate ricochets 
 Rhyming with me on the record? 
 You might as well had died and went to hell instead of heaven 
 'Cause my rhyme weapon is like a medieval torture method 
 Your four limbs tied to four horses, all pulling in different directions 
 In this profession I get busy without a question 
 Seeing me is like seeing a vampires reflection 
 Fast or slow flows connect like electrodes 
 I make cassette tape decks blow when I'm in wreck-mode 
 Explode leaving areas abandoned 
 With more radiation behind than the spots UFO's landed in 
 (Canibus) 
 I go to war, with the best of them 
 I spar, with the best of them 
 I keep it raw, with the best of them 
 I go hard, with the best of them 
 I go to war, with the best of them 
 I spar, with the best of them 
 I keep it raw, with the best of them 
 I go hard, with the best of them 
 I go to war, with the best of them 
 I spar, with the best of them 
 I keep it raw, with the best of them 
 I go hard, with the best of them 
 I go to war, with the best of them 
 I spar, with the best of them 
 I keep it raw, with the best of them 
 I go hard

 Can I Bus, will bust off before the coin toss 
 Then I rip your loin cloth off, look how small your genitals are 
 You got a Napoleon complex, barber shop gossip 
 Says you used to grab your ankles in jail for all the convicts 
 Lap dancing quadriceps, as fruity as a Pina Colada 
 On a tropical island in the Bahamas 
 Trying to win a bikini contest 
 Them skeletons in your closet got flesh on them and they smell rotten 
 Trying to battle, is like standing on a launch pad 
 In Cape Canaveral with me in the astronaut capsule 
 Ready to blast you, on a journey to space 
 Ready to turn your whole face into sirloin steak 
 Comparable to questions the Bible 
 How is it possible that the model ship fit through the neck of a bottle? 
 A Congo in this concrete jungle 
 Pull out your tonsils and stomp you into the Earth like fossils 
 (Canibus) 
 I go to war, with the best of them 
 I spar, with the best of them 
 I keep it raw, with the best of them 
 I go hard, with the best of them 
 I go to war, with the best of them 
 I spar, with the best of them 
 I keep it raw, with the best of them 
 I go hard, with the best of them 
 I go to war, with the best of them 
 I spar, with the best of them 
 I keep it raw, with the best of them 
 I go hard, with the best of them 
 I go to war, with the best of them 
 I spar, with the best of them 
 I keep it raw, with the best of them 
 I go hard

 I'm the meanest master of the ceremony on this whole team 
 And I can kill anything if it bleeds or breathes 
 Calling all front-line infantry forces on a mission 
 I got a Howitzer bigger than any Four-Fifth is 
 Rapping is a raw business 
 But as an individual I'm as different as anybody's finger print is 
 If boring is the norm, I'm the antonym 
 Put me in the same category you would put Marilyn Manson in 
 Bugging like a satanic evangelist 
 Jogging butt naked down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles 
 Every emcee in your crew will get ruined or wounded 
 You talk the bullshit, and be too scared to do shit 
 I'm the type of cat that would prove it, produce shit 
 Spent so much time in the studio I had to move in 
 A soldier, who practices West Indian Obia 
 I can drink the poison from a king cobra 
 Cause long after y'all are dead and gone 
 I survive the nuclear holocaust like a roach arthropod 
 Is it all soldier? 
 Sir, yes sir 
 Is there anything you need? 
 Sir, no sir 
 Report back to me before the briefing, at ease
