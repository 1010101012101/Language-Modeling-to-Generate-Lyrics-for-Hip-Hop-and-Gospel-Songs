(Canibus) 
 Yo yo yo 
 Now ain't nobody fucking with the mastermind 
 I'm like Einstein, a hundred and fifty times magnified 
 Nikola Tesla and John Von Neumann 
 All wrapped up in the body of one human 
 I rhyme the tightest, shine the brightest 
 I blind the optic fibers in anybody's iris 
 When it comes to rapping, I'll smash your ass 
 Whether you Latin, Black or Anglo-Saxon 
 I'll smack you wit a backhand 
 That crack your back like chiropractors after looking at your CAT scan 
 In between albums, I've become a masked man like Batman 
 And stalk my own rap fans 
 I'm like a madman fighting a war 
 Throwing lightning-rods, swinging lightning-swords 
 Blow you away wit a force that'll leave your body lost 
 Gone, nothing to mourn, nothing to do a autopsy on 
 I rock till I can't rock no more 
 Till I can't get no motherfucking props no more 
 Till they boo me on stage when I'm out on tour 
 Till 2000 B.C. ain't hot no more 
 I'm a dragon wit the head of a lion, jaws be like saws grinding 
 Claws rip through walls of cast iron 
 I slap fire outta hoodlum, pull out steel and start shooting 
 I clap iron like Duke Nukem 
 Try to attack 'Bis, you get your face stomped 
 Flatter than a compact disc with black Timbs 
 Flatter than a Yankee baseball cap rim 
 Flatter than the knife Jigga stabbed UN with

 If you the first nigga that laugh 
 I'll blow you in half 
 The first nigga to talk trash 
 I'ma blow you in half 
 The first nigga to show your ass 
 I'll blow you in half 
 The first time'll be your last 
 'Cause I'ma blow you in half 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, check it 
 I destroy your whole city block when I'm ready to rock 
 Blow the speaker box, magnetically shielded or not 
 Magnetically energy popping gates of radio waves 
 Oscillate lyrics and beats copulate to pop your tape 
 Manipulating space in large proportions 
 Millions of brain organs get lost when I start talking 
 About shit like supernatural forces 
 Gnomes and theories and Superstring theories 
 Most of you motherfuckers barely 
 Even understand the English language, much less think clearly 
 When I die, will I go to heaven or hell? 
 Or will I end up in a place called the Van Allen belt? 
 I researched my roots, looking for proof 
 The best place to hide a lie is between two truths 
 The aftermath of a nuclear blast 
 Where the average death sentence becomes a dead paragraph 
 I dig a five by nine rectangle in the grass 
 Read your epitaph and bury your ass 
 As the coffin gets lowered into the ground slowly 
 I'll sing all of your greatest hits, oldies on karaoke 
 (Canibus) 
 If you the first nigga that laugh 
 I'll blow you in half 
 The first nigga to talk trash 
 I'ma blow you in half 
 The first nigga to show your ass 
 I'll blow you in half 
 The first time'll be your last 
 'Cause I'ma blow you in half 
 If you the first nigga that laugh 
 I'll blow you in half 
 The first nigga to talk trash 
 I'ma blow you in half 
 The first nigga to show your ass 
 I'll blow you in half 
 The first time'll be your last 
 'Cause I'ma blow you in half
