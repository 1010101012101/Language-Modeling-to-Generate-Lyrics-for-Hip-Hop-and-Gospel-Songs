 Album: 
 (Canibus) 
 Now (A) or the Jersey path 
 Go to fifty-third street between sixth and seventh Ave. 
 Thirteen twenty-five, meet me on the fifth floor 
 And we can go to war, with the metaphors 
 I kick the ill rap, recoup a Gil strap 
 Step in the conference room and get your wig peeled back 
 In a lyrical grudge match 
 Where I be smashing, and bashing emcees (B) referees 
 I go by the name of the Canibus 
 Handsome like Malik Yoba without the ashy lips
