(Canibus) 
 Yo, the fact that I'm down wit Def Squad's hard to determine 
 Till you see me hopping out the Coupe wit e sermon 
 Or hopping out the Keith Murray suburban 
 Or hopping out the lex land wit Redman, wilding and cursing 
 My thought process is mysterious like the Lochness 
 My furious mindset is complex 
 Killing shit like a carnivorous militant prehistoric monster 
 Coming to stomp all over you hip-hop conference 
 Landed in an unidentified flying object 
 Turn you into an unidentified frying carcass 
 The smell of raw flesh make you nauseous 
 Acidest arsonist, burning your bones to carbon and phosphorus 
 My metaphors sting like after haircuts when 
 The alcohol is applied to the raw skin 
 So whoever wanna battle get blasted 
 Get your teeth enamel shattered, shitted on like pampers 
 You had a bad bitch, I left the back twist 
 I stuck my dick in everything from asshole to the nasal passage 
 Dug her out all day, then changed my sperm DNA 
 Now she got nobody to blame 
 I been spitting raw, what the fuck you think I'm living for 
 Throw me in jail, I'll do a prison tour 
 For wannabe hard niggaz, insecure niggaz 
 Wit they heads to big for they neck to support niggaz 
 Three in the squad plus me equal four members 
 An extra addition for any special force mission 
 Man listen 
 (Erick sermon) 
 Ain't these niggaz on some shit 
 Keith murray, canibus ain't no stoppin' it uh 
 (Keith Murray) 
 Let me draw a brief description of what happened 
 I was rapping, niggaz got the scrapping, guns got the clapping 
 Three-fifty-seven degrees I was separated 
 Have bullets deflected metal, bodies decapitated 
 Gush! a nigga got struck as I look 
 I caught the next guy running by with the metal hook 
 Blew his back open, blood gushed on my face 
 A bitch fainted 'cause she seen I enjoyed the taste 
 The case is that I split your melon 
 And feed it to the jigga-boos wit fried chicken wings 
 I'm wilding for long island, I turned and took Charles Ferguson 
 And open fire on any trains now 
 You may never know who's in your shadow 
 You punk ass niggaz just best stay shallow 
 And hollow, if you wanna live to see tomorrow 
 'Cause ain't no sun comin' out tomorrow 
 Yo, I might do something y'all niggaz might regret like 
 Blast you in your face and disregard your vest 
 I'm pissing and dissing off of recognition and niggaz to listen 
 Just to let you pussies know how I'm living 
 'Cause I return like the Jedi, wit my dead eye 
 Leave niggaz to die, peace to niggaz up in Bed-Stuy 
 Oh-ah, this that type of shit that make them niggaz wanna wet it 
 Word up, got me ready to set it 
 (Deja Vu) 
 Seems I steps with aggression 
 To any bitch who think they nice in this profession 
 What? what you think your wrecking? 
 I break your style down to little fragments 
 The pain is permanent, so spare yourself the embarrassment 
 Buck-fifty 'cross the face 
 Followed by knife wounds to the chest for your attempt to retaliate 
 I noticed all you bitches flows is based around clothes 
 But Deja Vu got something for you stanking hoes 
 Studio gangsta bitches I diminish ideas of bringing beef 
 Before the thought even finishes 
 I wanna see red, blood from a chicken head 
 'For I wild the fuck out like the grateful dead 
 This wild style must run in my genes 
 Because my sister's in the county and my brother just came home from green 
 I strike like the black widow, through the underground radio 
 Kiddo and still stack dirty ditto
