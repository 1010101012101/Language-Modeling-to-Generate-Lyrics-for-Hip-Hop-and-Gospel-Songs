 Yo yo, I just appeared outta nowhere, 1980 was the year 
 Engineered as a biological weapon of warfare 
 Now with this I generate with more fear 
 Even though back then nobody cared and people wasn't as scared 
 I never used to get so much attention 
 Most of the top contenders at the time I was good friends with 
 For instance my man small pox was hot 
 He used to SoundScan ten thousand a week and that was a lot 
 That nigga hepatitis b, he was hyper than me 
 He used to get between twelve and twenty thousand a week 
 Alcohol was the neighbourhood star 
 Bubbling, drugs had niggaz juggling 
 All kinds of controlled substances 
 My man cancer was like Charles Manson 
 Cigarettes almost made the surgeon general ban them 
 Homicide was buggin 'cause he had guns to amp them 
 And I was on the low amp 'cause I had a plant kid 
 (Canibus and Lisa Stone) 
 AIDS is gold and HIV was platinum 
 Sit down, ask them where you get your facts from 
 Five hundred thousand niggaz in the hood with it 
 And a million more niggaz is getting ready to get it 
 AIDS is gold and HIV was platinum 
 Sit down, ask them where you get your facts from 
 Five hundred thousand niggaz in the hood with it 
 And a million more niggaz is getting ready to get it

 Yo, yo, now that millions is dead I'm considered widespread 
 Number one on the top ten and considered a worldwide threat 
 To all the kids, thirteen to twenty-three trying 
 Sex, unsafe sex, you niggaz need to use latex 
 H.I.V will progress to A.I.D.S 
 And transform your warm blooded bones to dry flesh 
 By stressing the immune system, promiscuous men and women 
 Trying to avoid getting the micro-organism in them 
 From running up in it raw ready and willing 
 A couple of minutes of a good feeling is what'll kill them 
 Break ya body down in steps, breath for breath 
 In the hospital with less then a dozen t-cells left 
 AIDS is gold and HIV was platinum 
 Sit down, ask them where you get your facts from 
 Five hundred thousand niggaz in the hood with it 
 And a million more niggaz is getting ready to get it

 Yo, I went from 'Killing Them Softly' to killing them harshly 
 Minorities from twenty to forty can't afford to ignore me 
 They do my dirty work for me - going to 
 Raunchy ass parties where they be having orgies to transport me 
 Through the semen and blood, needles and drugs 
 Choose which one of the two demons in evil you trust 
 'Cause the only way I could be detected is by getting tested 
 And most people don't question the person they having sex with 
 As to whether or not they infected 
 Even the people you already slept wit wouldn't suspect that they can catch it 
 Forty percent of the aids patients is Afro-Americans 
 And we only twelve percent of the population 
 That statement is a fact, Latinos and blacks face it 
 It came straight from the world health organization 
 It's the iron fist, scientist, slash rhymechiatrist 
 Here to diagnose that we dying quick 
 AIDS is gold and HIV was platinum 
 Sit down, ask them where you get your facts from 
 Five hundred thousand niggaz in the hood with it 
 And a million more niggaz is getting ready to get it 
 AIDS is gold and HIV was platinum 
 Sit down, ask them where you get your facts from 
 Five hundred thousand niggaz in the hood with it 
 And a million more niggaz is getting ready to get it
