(Intro: Canibus) 
 Yeah, The Dragon of Judah 
 Melatonin Magik producer, yeah 
 (Canibus) 
 Mr. Magorium's Metaphor Emporium 
 Vainglorious warriors with deep space euphoria 
 The Dragon of Judah executed the Lion from Narnia 
 I'm still tryna build God's army up 
 The pedagogy tried to call me a communist 
 And pacify my audience, sprinkle them with zombie dust 
 The icosahedron is a prison for a three headed demon 
 Hip Hop behemoth 
 Knowledge is needed to argue with the followers of Jesus 
 Rearranging impossible pieces, my quantum is increasing 
 I am sleeping in a posturpedic, deeply breathing 
 Dreaming a chakra site-seeing, philosophically speaking 
 I saw Gandhi weakening from not eating 
 I saw police brutality beatings 
 I saw the leaders getting into spaceships and leaving 
 I tried to search for possible meanings but I couldn't see the logical reasoning 
 'Cept survival of the species, no Macbook no PCs 
 No electricity, no TV 
 No emcee battles, no Christmas carols 
 Just international tabble, brown produce consumed by sick cattle 
 Bovine mammals hooked up to intravenous vaccination panels 
 Collecting contaminated skin samples 
 This is not natural, God damn you! 
 Everybody on the planet don't deserve that, not even the animals 
 You are completely culpable for everything you're supposed to do 
 Even if it's not known to you 
 The weight of the language I spoke to you 
 The weight of the letters and the words in the rhymes that I wrote for you 
 Are so so emotional, I don't even know what to do 
 So I'ma leave the choice up to you 
 (Break: Canibus) 
 Dragon of Judah 
 I spit like a supernatural computer 
 Professor Bis, I'm with the Minister of Intelligence 
 Hold me down Professor Griff 
 (Professor Griff) 
 Minds that produce minds that produce minds like mines 
 (Canibus) 
 Now everyone want to talk about conspiracy 
 You should of took Channel Zero more seriously 
 Professor Bis got a ghetto Ph.D in Chemistry 
 Professor Griff taught me how to spit it lyrically 
 Now I'm part of the Ministry 
 Put my name on the blacklist 'cause I don't dickride nobody in the industry 
 Where's the fucking empathy? I've been through so much treachery 
 Most of the best emcees disrespected me 
 And tried to get the best of me, never tried to rescue me 
 Or help me with the recipe, what do they expect from me? 
 Stressing me, questioning me to address the beef 
 I rep Hip Hop, Hip Hop don't rep me 
 I never got a penny off that Beef DVD 
 You mean all that money went to QD3? 
 I should have slammed the door in his face 
 If I was a different nigga, I'da been caught a criminal case 
 The best word to describe what you do to Hip Hop is 'rape' 
 'Cause you don't care about Hip Hop's fate 
 You sit around your tables and say grace 
 Eating steak, while you live like kings and treat kings like apes 
 For Michael Jackson money, and still on the take 
 Even Tevin Campbell's money, the greed is so great 
 You probably dance around your mansion, like Cirque Du Soleil 
 Everything is paid for, you don't have to pro-rate 
 I ain't hating, I'm not hating, I'm just saying 
 You makin' money off the next man's struggle. Why you can't pay him? 
 They made millions off them Beef DVDs 
 But didn't pay K-Solo or Eazy E 
 It's called Blaxploitation 
 Another one of Canibus' paranoid statements that's why I'm famous 
 I'm just tryna tell niggas how the game is 
 Beef in Hip Hop is just aimless entertainment 
 If I shoot you, I'm blameless 
 But if you shoot me, you famous, what's a nigga to do? 
 Now ain't that the goddamn truth 
 No matter what Hip Hop always lose 
 Wake the fuck up!
