Shark boy gave lava girl an epidural... 
 Yeah, they live out there somewhere rural 
 I move through the trees without a breeze 
 Not displacing any of the leafs you are chasing me on your knees 
 I'll lie to you, even if you think I'm agreeing 
 I won't spy for you even if you can see what I'm seeing 
 The cyclops with dry wax in his ear slots 
 Protious Syndrome like his pops, his skull is shaped like a teardrop 
 The beat changes its rhythm they both change their pitch position 
 I'll make an incision to bring it back to life with a written 
 Of lyricism and wisdom, my children... 
 You are now free souls in an "infinite" prison 
 Karma Infinite, M-Eighty, Canibus... 
 You can't rhyme like this unless you rhyming with us 
 Karma Infinite, M-Eighty, Canibus... 
 You can't rhyme like this unless you rhyming with us!
