Can-I-Bus, wash off the rust 
 This is prophecy, I ain't just talking tough 
 Democracy Rules Everything Around Me, D.R.E.A.M. 
 They put me in charge of the new Tiger Team 
 Illmatic, still savage, still at it 
 Mechanics build the rhymes, I build the mechanics 
 Binary language, trinary programming? 
 To copy rap flows nowadays is no challenge 
 Smoke don't rise in the opposite direction 
 Overhead projectors don't stop till perfection 
 Gallop over the poles, after the election 
 The master of impressions, like Zecharia Sitchin 
 Permission to get crunked up, ask the instructor 
 Big Brother, nigga lover, want lyrics this summer 
 We live in tumultuous times, I must be out of my mind 
 Recording rhymes like I'm soldering wires 
 Behind giant porcelain tigers with needle nose pliers 
 They told me I was hired, so I left with those buyers 
 My shit got less talk, but it's a bit lighter 
 Tell General Myers I'll fix both fighters 
 Situational awareness of all areas 
 Knowledge is the disease we are all carriers 
 Of Flownitis, flow the nicest with no guidance 
 From the Hip Hop... anti-virus 
 Sun rises, 30 arc seconds the sun spot crisis 
 Put fucking blisters on your iris 
 Ten observations per satellite 
 The higher masses orbit the rhyme, the faster I write
