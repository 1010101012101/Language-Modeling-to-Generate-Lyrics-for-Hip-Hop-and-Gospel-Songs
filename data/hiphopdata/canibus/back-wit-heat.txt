(Canibus) 
 Yeah 
 The, the, the, the 
 The rhyme weapon legend 
 That's what my nigga's yellin' 
 That's what they yellin' 
 The, the, the, the 
 The rhyme weapon legend 
 Yeah, niggas just don't know 
 That's what my nigga's yellin' 
 But I'ma let 'em know 
 Let 'em know 'Bis 
 How to flow 
 How to 
 How to go 
 How to 
 How to 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, 
 If I coughed in my fist when I opened my hand 
 There'd be dope in my hand 'cause I spoke in my hand 
 In the gym till I turned a two-pack to a four 
 Till the four got sore and had to make two more 
 In a whole other state of mind 
 Mexican standoffs waste lives but they save time 
 You know the danger of the Ranger, pantyhose over cabeza 
 Scopes and lasers, my toaster is a widow-maker 
 "Good things comes to those that wait" 
 Bullshit, better things come to those that chase 
 I sweep the streets with a fleet bigger than the Greeks 
 Till we occupy your land like thiefs 
 We fittin' to eat, nigga 
 (Canibus) 
 I'm back for the music 
 Back to do exclusives 
 Back to change the view of Hip Hop from that bullshit 
 Back to mash up beats that bang up your Ave and streets 
 Canibus, nigga, Back with heat 
 (Canibus) 
 Ayo, 
 Hideout the box with Nottz, shots just went off 
 Nigga better check to see if you caught 
 Shootouts between rap stars driving fast cars 
 Through the hills of Madagascar, we can take it that far 
 Screw-face you niggas 
 Yo, who's the real rude bwoy, rude nigga? 
 Not you nigga, you got booed nigga 
 My close quarter combat, not bad 
 Big niggas drop dead when I stop their air 
 You're just a man, you're relationship with oxygen's clear 
 Canibus rockin' with Nottz this year 
 Yeah, mother fuckers, your back-blast area clear 
 Canibus rockin' with Nottz this year 
 Yeah 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, ayo 
 A slug to the stomach make a thug move sluggish 
 Crawling in his bloodiness no matter how big the gun is 
 If the fuzz is coming, blast shells by the tonnage 
 Till there ain't nothing left and start runnin' // (Run!) 
 I got a message bout I got a court summons 
 Everybody around me want somethin', they all extort nothin' 
 I was young, I was stupid, I was really too hyped 
 'Cause I thought a microphone was really worth my life 
 Go make a club banger, that's what they ask me to do 
 You a dumb nigga, who the fuck is asking you? 
 I'll write a book for you, Nottz'll write a hook for you 
 We can both split half of what we took from you 
 I'm just a round-the-way neighbor in your hood 'fella 
 You want to show love? Let's break bud nigga 
 We control the price of rap-fuel 
 I attacked you because annual tax was due 
 Four dollars a gallon, we're going to take it back to two 
 Hip Hop nigga, that's what we back to do 
 For you, for you, for you 
 That's what we back to do 
 For you, for you, for you 
 (Canibus) 
 The, the, the, the 
 The rhyme weapon legend 
 That's what my nigga's yellin'
