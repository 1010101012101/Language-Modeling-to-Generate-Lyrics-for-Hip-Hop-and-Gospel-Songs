 JYNXT is the name, but you can call me Prince Germaine 
 Watch me change, through my fits of rage 
 When the Tourette Syndrome phases, engaged 
 I attract the gaze of a million eyes transfixed on stage 
 Good things come to those who wait, 'bullshit,' I say 
 Better things come to those who chase 
 Concentrate, get your mind right 
 The quantum leap of faith into the blind light 
 Ey yo, listen to this 
 I spit it, I spurt it, I bake it, I burned it, I take it, I earn it 
 I leave your brain naked and nervous 
 Cussing and cursing, I slither when I'm swerving like a Chinese serpent 
 Your muscles are hurting, the poison is working
