They say Bis, show me something that can get me killed 
 I say naw man, you don't want to feel that thrill 
 We defile one another, so stop freestylin' muthafucka' 
 It ain't nothing to be proud of brother 
 Let go your ego, then you will connect with the people 
 Everything else is all evil 
 Identity distorts our survival collectively 
 The magic magnetically protected me hermetically 
 Energetically I never fuck with telepathy 
 You act like a asshole 
 I step to my business and my niggaz gon' step with me 
 Mathematics right to the left of me, volcanic pressure release 
 Have I defeated you before? Agree with a nod 
 If you disagree then you need more bars 
 Teach you how to behave, savages are treated like slaves 
 Get your wages donated to clear the raid (?) 
 Yeah, you a brave renegade till they crack your egg 
 With a powder keg strapped to the back of your head 
 I smoke so much I snore, spit it raw 
 Hydrate, then put lyrics back on the board 
 I'm a hog in balls, deep drawers 
 Heartbeat, jaws, eagle claws for meat carvin' every mornin' 
 No peace for the Gods, the beast takes the shape of the stars 
 The invaded armada at dawn 
 Land on the White House lawn, with flip-flops on 
 That's right I'm not armed, singin' hip-hop songs
