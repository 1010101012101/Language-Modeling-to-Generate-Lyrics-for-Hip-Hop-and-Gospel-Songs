(Canibus) 
 Yeah, yo, Genabis revisited 
 The lyricist you wouldn't miss if Canibus wasn't so good at this 
 I testify before congress, but not yet 
 Hip Hop's vet may be Hip Hop's best 
 I'm two stories up in the Palomar Observatory 
 People working for me organising verses for me 
 My student saw me 
 Some of them have learned to ignore me 
 I write till morning, it's slightly boring 
 I store all the exabyte tapes that record me 
 You can sell the most albums, I'ma sell the last one 
 Right before the Armageddon happens 
 The population retarded, Apocalypse already started 
 You waiting for the news to report it 
 Military jargon frogmen laced the target 
 Disengage the rally point and bomb it 
 A folded note was written, given to Channel 7 
 Channel 7 said I was dead in Yemen 
 I cried when I talked to my nigga Charles Suit 
 For thirty seconds I hung up, it's all I could do 
 I dark skinned man approached the command post 
 Show the logo, I shaked his hand when he got close 
 Pine Gap spinal tap, now is the time to attack 
 Kill the General, I'll holler in the back 
 Always remember, meet me in Denver, 
 Colorado Springs in the Vandenberg Welcome Center 
 I go places, remote locations 
 Pack flotations for giant wave formations 
 Dismount, Recon Scouts march south 
 I've got the grid location of the fallout 
 OK, everybody out, over here, get a body count 
 Sound off I'ma copy it down 
 Authenticate the DNA, walk through the security gate 
 Perfectly clean, a dirty Marine 
 So lyrically cold, snowflakes symmetry flow 
 Is hard to lip sync even when you know 
 Laser guided star tactic optics 
 Listen to the rhyme you can tell when it's not Bis 
 I rhyme like this in a benign climate 
 Nobody else knows 'cause nobody else tried it 
 Hello, to the visiting research fellow 
 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' my flow bellows 
 Let me welcome you to a panoramic view 
 Of what we about to sell you 
 702 make some motherfucking noise
