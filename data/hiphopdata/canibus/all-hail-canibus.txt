(Canibus) 
 Yo 
 I stand outside the gates of Buckingham Palace, selling reefer 
 Puffing a chalice with the beef eaters 
 Getting so high that whenever I drop shit 
 It'll land on the window of your airplane cockpit 
 Canibus with the hot shit, crazy I click 
 Niggas is bloody idiots thinking that they can stop this 
 I'll increase my strength, to a super human extent 
 Nigga your rhyme ain't worth six pence 
 And if you can hear, smell, see, touch, and taste 
 Then you don't need six senses to feel me punch you in the face 
 From Princeton, to Clapham Common, my lyrics invade Europe like Joseph Stalin 
 And murder niggas for rhyming 
 Spitting fire, with gasoline for saliva 
 Drunk as Lady Diana's driver with reporters behind her 
 Alcohol in the hands of a minor 
 I got you panicking like bombs, with thirty second timers 
 Clear the building, evacuate women and children 
 Fuck what you feeling nigga I came here to kill them 
 Straight shitting, from New York to Great Britain 
 And when we do shows we make the queen pay admission 
 What? 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, yo 
 Prepare for the worst, this next verse is the face of death 
 Me without lyrics is like a porn flick without sex 
 Illmatic, my lyrical skills are Jurassic 
 With more flavour then skittles when I'm digitally mastered 
 I go off like a cannon, and blow up the planet with no fear 
 Like them clothes white boys be wearing 
 I'm tougher than denim, lethal like venomous snake bites 
 The marijuana makes my eyes bright-red like brake lights 
 There ain't a party I couldn't rock, believe that 
 There ain't a microphone brave enough to give me feedback 
 I'm strong my word is bond like James 
 Niggas be trying to test but they weak like seven days 
 Emcees run away when I kick it, they act so chicken 
 They should come with a large drink and a biscuit 
 My styles radioactive, massive atomic, I plan to push the Earth 
 In front of Haley's comet, breaking the facts of life down 
 Like Tudy, I'm raw like sushi, with more vocab, then 
 Three fucking Fugees, so recognize or be hospitalized 
 'Cause lyrically on a scale of one, to ten, I'm twenty-five 
 Like that 
 (Canibus) 
 A little bit of weed and some Hennessey 
 Got me ready to set it with kinetic energy 
 See I need much more energy then my enemies 
 If I want to make more Bill's than Bellamy 
 So I could be on MTV, with women constantly telling me 
 I resemble Billy D., I make fly rhymes to get my name on the scene 
 Then when I'm on the scene I do shows to get the green 
 Then I take the green buy a automobile machine 
 For that thing on page forty-three, in Jet Magazine 
 Canibus is the ultimate executioner's dream, swinging the guillotine 
 'Cause whenever the head is severed from the human body 
 With a sharp enough weapon, the brain remains conscious for ten seconds 
 Long enough for me to give you one last message 
 And when you get to hell, you can tell Lucifer I said it 
 Don't ever get it confused, fucking with Canibus the human rubrics cube 
 Like you got something to prove 
 Yo whoever grabs the mic after me will get booed 
 Get everything in the club thrown at you and your crew 
 From Moette bottles to bar stools, fruits and foods 
 You got a album out you'll get hit with your CD too 
 Running outside, crying, lying, denying that you ain't 
 The gay rapper, but you got fucked by him 
 What's the difference, y'all niggas still ain't in lyrical fitness 
 Too busy mixing your business, with your bitches 
 While I be in the lab composing forbidden scriptures 
 So wicked, I got Satan ejaculating on his fingers 
 Like Dirk Diggler, in the middle of Boogie Nights 
 Sniffing white living the hype, he ruined his life 
 But I'm an emcee of a different type, yeah that's right 
 Make sure your shit is tight, or I'm a snatch your mic 
 Nigga
