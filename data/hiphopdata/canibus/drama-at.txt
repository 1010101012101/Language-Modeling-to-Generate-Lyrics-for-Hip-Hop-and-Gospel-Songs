(Canibus) 
 Executive Order 11002 
 The reason you know me but I don't know you 
 You really want to know what drama is let me show you 
 Keep it in mind this is just one point of view 
 Drama is living in a Third World country 
 Fucked up and hungry without no money 
 Drama is trying to adjust to the circumstance 
 Missing more than one leg and more than one hand 
 Drama is being chased off your land 
 By a funny looking man in a suit that works for the bank 
 Drama is what's happening to the ecosystem 
 And the animals it feeds, the damage to trees 
 The rain forests that get destroyed annually 
 Damn is it just me who cares about the air that we breathe? 
 Drama is the nuclear threat that we live with 
 One bomb and everybody's dead, that's some sick shit 
 Drama is HIV statistics 
 The infected person that you might have sex with 
 Life goes on 
 But drama is living with the afterthought that maybe you could've prevented it 
 Drama is eminent it comes in other forms 
 The sick paedophiles who support child porn 
 Never mind the offenders 
 Think about what the victims go through, what the fuck they've got to live with 
 Drama is the prison population 
 Some belong there but also some belong on probation 
 Drama is not being able to change one thing 
 'Cause the system you live in says you ain't shit 
 Drama is corporate scandal 
 Drama is a handful of C.O's playing you for the damn fool 
 Drama is being a millionaire 
 But you've got to recoup half the budget from your ten-percent share 
 Drama is having one too many women 
 Even though you always need a spare one to swim in 
 Drama is dealing with your jealous impulses 
 Learning how to hold it all in with no emotion 
 Drama is blind devotion 
 Drama is having your deepest secrets exposed in the open 
 Drama is having your heart broken 
 And the person who broke it doesn't even motherfucking notice 
 Drama is trying to carry the burden all by yourself 
 On your shoulders and it don't exist 
 Drama is being falsely accused, drama is the latest news 
 Drama is what gives people clues 
 Drama is a tool you can use 
 To distract the enemy so they can never improve 
 Drama is fear of devils and fear of God 
 Drama is a long and hard tech-support desk job 
 Drama is the life of an up-and-coming actor 
 Or rapper, or athlete, or building contractor 
 Drama is a rookie cop calling for backup 
 '3 Strike' perpetrator that's gang-tatted up 
 Drama is the spin zone of a politician 
 Drama is K-Solo when he said the rhyme did it 
 Drama is the struggle of change 
 Drama is inevitable there is no other way 
 Drama is what drains life force out of you 
 Drama is negative but drama can empower you 
 Drama is love, drama is pain 
 Drama exists in everything everyday 
 Drama is the yen, drama is the yang 
 Drama is the innate nature of man 
 Drama contracts, drama expands 
 Drama is what I am 
 (Luminati) 
 Pull up a chair to the aristocracy of commonwealth prophecy 
 The legacy of generation three isosceles 
 Logical geometry, illogical melodies 
 Integrated with memories that mix melodically 
 Beyond the insight of what a modern-day monkey sees 
 Get chopped in three for pathetic hypocrisy 
 False bureaucracy breeds poetic monopolies 
 Chateau de Trevano is my property 
 An addict for drama and dramatic oddities 
 Addicted to bottles of sticky green botany 
 In a reflection of the split seas you see me in 3D 
 Tripping off three hits of E 
 Half-a-tablet for you 2-and-a-half for me 
 A rappers speech is slurred for eternal depravity 
 Naturally ignore gravity project astrally 
 Ascend gradually till the stratosphere passes me 
 Earth's actually esoterically absent to me 
 Take a crack at me with blurred clarity - battle me 
 Spiders crawl outta the skin the six headed beast 
 Evil beings that wrestle with demons in the deep 
 Useless to eat 200 pounds of rotten meat 
 Shrink heads drink black milk collect black teeth 
 Luminati tribal chief wear it as trophy piece 
 My women are ornamented with a blood soaked wreath 
 Like Christmas minus Christ plus the heat 
 The Ascended Master, leader of all immortal freaks 
 Voodoo curse on your last and future release 
 Unleash the worst plague put the world under siege 
 Till your name is unheard and your face is unseen 
 Till your just a nightmare of an accursed dream 
 Tell the supreme to curse your whole team and your unborn seed 
 Poison your queen like the Furher's last week 
 In the blood filled streets you're a leech 
 Less than a man a poverty stricken thief with grief 
 At night you speak to Satan before you go to sleep 
 Worshipping the flesh like poor pagan priests 
 Your future's oblique, I command your heart to seize its beat 
 Thou shall inherit disease and defeat... 
 Drama... Drama... Drama... Drama
