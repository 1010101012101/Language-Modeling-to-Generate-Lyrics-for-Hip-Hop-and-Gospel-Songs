Come sit with me 
 I show you how I consistanly manifest multipicity 
 Lyrically if you can do the same let me see 
 If you can than you are not my enemy 
 And if can not than I must make you a better MC 
 Lets turn to page three we'll start there 
 The contract says you gotta have a thousand bars to spare 
 You think this type of hip hop is one dimensional but it's not 
 You don't understand what I gave you 
 You don't understand what you got 
 I know you well though 
 You think you can out rap me HELL NO 
 Unknown till I step to the microphone 
 Canibus turn this shit into a crisis zone 
 Automaticlly the sharpest at it, this just practice 
 Canibus Keith Murray, I'm a shark he a savage 
 Satellite rappers delight we battle for the mic 
 In a convo bench pressing bags of brown rice 
 The modern day hiphop hooray 
 From ______ _______? spittin' lyrics from top of the 808 
 They used to call me mental case 
 But one day men will say he immigrated beyond heavens gate 
 My net worth is my next verse 
 In a race to a billion bars what if you could get there first 
 He had guns attached his guns where black 
 Stuck here to thumb tacks placed on a wall sized map 
 This is not sorcery this is just a lyrical part of me 
 My artistry please pardon me 
 So I can watch satellites go over the earth 
 I count thousands they probably just stole my verse 
 From the _____ to the ________ 
 Slaughterd in an ounce of water 
 Bis and Murray this is UnderGod horror 
 UnderGod Horror, Show'em what crazy is 
 UnderGod Horror, Show'em what crazy is 
 UnderGod Horror, Show'em what crazy is 
 UnderGod Horror, Show'em what crazy is 
 It's a Hard Job but somebody got do it 
 It's a Hard Job but somebody got do it
