(Canibus) 
 Enter the Mic Club, this is where it all starts 
 MCs defend their honour at all costs 
 Cycle of winners, this ain't for beginners 
 Front and centre, state your name, rank and business 
 When I pass you the mic, you better burn it 
 Don't be squeamish, you want respect you gotta earn it 
 This is where we define purpose, how much heart lies beneath the surface 
 What's hidden behind the curtain 
 Besides tight verses, nothing in life is certain 
 If you live as long as your words, you make life worth it 
 Writing rhymes give me a buzz, I do this for the love 
 Welcome to the M-I-C Club
