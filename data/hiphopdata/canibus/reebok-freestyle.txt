Yo... 
 I was made on an assembly line 
 My aero dynamic design 
 And my stitches were ahead of my time 
 I come in all assorted colors and dyes 
 Colors that attract eyes 
 And I'm defined by capital a.i 
 Worn by the feet 
 Of the illest athletes to ever compete 
 And I'm worn by the kids on the streets 
 I keep you gripped to the ground 
 I'm the reason that people think you got style 
 The reason people "I love you iverson" - girls saying it 
 Shine to the croud 
 The reason fans see you and smile 
 The reason philly drafted you in the tryouts 
 The reason you just too quick to be fouled 
 And I'm probably the same reason you the leading scorer in the league 
 Now 
 I'm the reason that you zig-zag-ziggin' 
 The reason that you got benjamins 
 And the reason that you bling blingin' 
 The reason that you the nicest 
 Wit the rock, andyou can't be stopped 
 (Word? who are you?) 
 The answer, from reebok 
 Part 2 
 Beware, if e equals MC squared 
 Than a.i. equals ankles in intensive care 
 The answer keeps you glued to the ground suspended in air 
 The answer to every prayer for every player everywhere 
 Try to compare 
 Try to block the shot if you dare 
 You get the best seat in the house, it's called the wheelchair 
 The math ? umopis?, you should be a reebok owner 
 Killer crossovers split opponent's in half like moses 
 All contenders are left defenseless 
 They end up in hospital beds with swollen tendens, takin' anit-depressants 
 They can't seem to deal with them pressure 
 I came to give you this message 
 I got the ammo for your weapons, and the answer for your question
