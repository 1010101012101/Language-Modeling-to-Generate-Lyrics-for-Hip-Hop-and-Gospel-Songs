(Break: Canibus) 
 Yeah, Guerrilla Alliance, 
 Vega X, what's the science? 
 (Canibus) 
 In America hearts and minds start to backslide 
 In a sorcery, now we being attack on all sides 
 How tall is a God? Taller than satellite eyes 
 In the skies, printing high resolution stand-by's 
 Fucking with this rap shit, insurance policies must be active 
 Especially if your spouse in unattractive 
 Stop, there ain't no such thing as writers block 
 Look at all these mother fucking biters going pop 
 You sound like somebody else, I said stop! 
 You'll be Dead by Design by the time the album drops 
 You spent all this time tryna put an album out 
 And no body gives a fuck what the album is about 
 Do you? Don't you dare answer me with your mouth 
 If Hip Hop was my house, why I gotta get out? 
 I've been out, been stoned and scrolled 
 The drum beat, the flow 
 Your money machine trombones, my rifle unfolds 
 Stories untold, as if the Hindenburg Omen will only affect one soul on this globe 
 Can not be taken, it must be given or bestowed 
 Radio show freestyle, go, rip shows 
 If the heart desires nothing you will not experience suffering 
 The crying, the cussing, the red eyes, the rubbing 
 You are not in control, you are just a puppet 
 Or Muppet, which was it? Yes, let's change the subject 
 Muscles expand, rip through pants 
 Drop kicking niggas who take motorcycle trips through France 
 Siberian werewolf drinking Smirnoff, 
 ?Listen to the beat? toss you to vampire, don't you dare talk 
 Day walk, they time talk, show hope, start dancing at dark 
 Large fangs, Wesley Snipes fro-hawk 
 Kirk Jones sitting in court tryna gather his thoughts 
 He battled niggas in a tunnel in New York, I saw it 
 I was there, I applauded, it was 4:34 in the morning 
 I just witnessed history, I was yawning 
 I was tired of performing, inspired by the Hip Hop audience 
 ?Elo-elo? talks through us, Can-I-Bus 
 Pacing and leading, writing and reading 
 All knowledge is increasing, the unknown is receding 
 The Earth is teeming with life, stream it on the mic 
 Real emcees on my left, dope producers to my right
