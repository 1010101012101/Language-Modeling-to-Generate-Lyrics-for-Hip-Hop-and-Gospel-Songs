(Mr. Cheeks) 
 One time 
 We bless the track 
 Rush to the back 
 It's the LB fam dogg pound we attack 
 One time for the LP, LB 
 My family come through 
 This who we do 
 Group Home, Universal bounce one 
 Power moves to be made 
 Rap game is paid 
 Clown niggaz gettin' paid 
 It's gettin', jumpin' some babes 
 The mind state steady thinkin' 
 One dutch burnin 
 I'm already thinkin' 
 Here to lay the real 
 I know to kill 
 I feel the envy 
 But those that try to bind me 
 Right behind me wit my members 
 ??? To see right here through the violence strap 
 But keep this hennessey and my main man's rap 
 Caught up in the game black can't explain that 
 But longevity that's what I aim at 
 You wanna come through 
 And test yo fuckin' skill 
 Kid I go the shit that pray the rams plus the bills 
 Sent your clown niggaz back and touch a fuckin' hill 
 Me and my fam givin' competition chills 
 For from the east to the west 
 LP all of LB now who's the best 
 Break your wins down like a pronoun 
 On the phone touch me and my click Tha Dogg Pound 
 Throw your hands up you wanna fuckin' toss 
 I'm that guy land of the lost 
 Listen up, special wit a ??? style 
 Come wit and you'll love bein' high 
 One 4 pound and my brotha Freaky Tah 
 Music Makes Me High 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo combination of Mr. Cheeks, Canibus and Kurupt 
 Is enough to make the reels on cassette tapes bust 
 Cause none of you fools is capable 
 My lyrical'll knock you on the floor like a mechanical bull 
 Rhymes ricochet off the inner walls of my lungs 
 To past the tongue faster then bullets come out of guns 
 Who wants to be the one to get struck first 
 I bury they body on any planet except the earth 
 I rip up, swell your lip up, it's a stick up 
 Make put your hands up on your head like you was doin' sit-ups 
 Lost Boyz nad DPG causin trouble 
 We Out of control like inter-voluntary hustle 
 Kid nobody else smokes more then my team 
 20 grams of weed and a gallon of visine 
 Yaknahme, I fly the friendly sky's when ever music makes me high 
 Chorus: I'm so high, this music makes me high (x4) 
 (Kurupt) 
 Kurupt in your game, what's ya know, where ya at 
 I'm comin' through wit a mack, I'm out to get my paper back 
 You can't harm me even if lip was froze 
 Get incinerated from verbal inferno 
 Born created get physical castrated 
 I'm so glad I made in a world where I'm hated 
 Big time gama got the game orcastrated 
 Correct me mashin in Jags and Benzes 
 Imitatin cause youse an imitater punk 
 Jump wit kurupt and get slumped 'cause I dump 
 With no question or no hesitation I'm bussin 
 End discussion as my adrenaline's rushin 
 Or ??? your mr. cash for the capital 
 Was actual, ??? fact I use tactical skill 
 Get popped like girls tryin' ta jump at the real 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Can I ride, can I rock my broads 
 Cause ??? rhymes and lethal last rhyme lines 
 Time after time I beat the hell out of a track 
 Most definitely I gets busy when we attack 
 ????, Dialogues and formats 
 Be on some ill type streets raps from way back 
 As a child I got wilder styles 
 I used to shine all day and a rocked the crowd 
 I destroy and completely evaporize my opponents 
 Be on it like a hornet kickin dat in your stomach 
 Dogg gone it tell my why they wanna kill daz 
 Cause daz gets the killin' and buillin cash rounds 
 So get tell me I'll come around 
 So get down lost boyz and dogg pound 
 I bet ya get see me now tell whatcha gonna do 
 A tough guy can be a dead guy when fuckin' wit my crew 
 So fasten your seat belt and see a hornets trip 
 Well me stay hardcore for whatever, whtever 
 Chorus to fade
