Yeah, yeah Can-I-Bus, Mic Club 
 (Nothin' to prove it's all love) 
 (Canibus) 
 I bust through like Sputnik 2 
 This is man's best friend, whoopty-woo 
 The flag is black, red, and blue 
 Troops shoot from the hoopty 
 Dogs jump out of dooly 
 But it take more than that to move me 
 Like; wireless mics for tireless nights 
 Firefights inspire my life, why do I write? 
 Twenty-year Hip-Hop vet, they perceive me as a threat 
 They manifest beads of sweat 
 Examine the blood trail 
 Squeeze triggers, puss drip out of the thumbnails 
 I smell like gun shells 
 Polonium, pandemonium, with a dose of Unknownium 
 The Soviet Hugo Rodier 
 Fourth generation roper report 
 Everything I was taught bore a resemblance to my thoughts 
 The truth in the design of the Guggenheim rhyme 
 Where every line is weaponized then applied 
 Mob shit, target acquisition is sick 
 I don't miss when I twist the 5.56 
 Stand there with arms folded 
 Firearms make me look large and bloated 
 ("I'm gonna have to project my voice") 
 Equipment check, church bells chime 
 ("Some of this stuff might get intense") 
 One more time... 
 Just kill 'em 'Bus 
 Ain't nobody around to witness nothin' 
 Heaven's Devil strangle Hell's Angel with a mic cable 
 Then J Wells came through 
 (Sample from Nas @ the L.A. Listening Party on December 14th, 2006) 
 "Yo, the niggaz that use to have a nigga a little nervous was like; 
 B.I.G., 'Pac, (Right), even Canibus, like Eminem them niggaz use to have me like 
 If we go at it dawg we gotta go HARD!" 
 "Yo, the niggaz that use to have a nigga a little nervous was like; 
 B.I.G., 'Pac, (Right), even Canibus, like Eminem them niggaz use to have me like 
 If we go at it dawg we gotta go HARD!" 
 (Canibus) 
 Yeah, yo 
 I support a secure change of custody 
 Don't trust the beat, trust me Canibus the emcee 
 Without movin' my neck I turn to the left 
 Yes, I am the best you will learn to respect 
 Till your death Hip-Hop is the body, you are the chest 
 I am the vest, we are sworn to protect 
 This behavioral bomb, rewritable radio songs 
 "What station is your radio on?" 
 My trainin' is worth millions 
 Imam death squad rush the building 
 From the front line with Prince William 
 I am Prince Williams, exercise cover and concealment 
 Prohibit the media from filming 
 Never in the moment, always thinkin' of the Omen 
 Our poor soldiers; nobody told them 
 Inoculate, I postulate not to wait 
 Drop to your face, the active component will not break 
 My Armenian friend tried to pay me in Yen 
 I threw the money in his face and said "Pay me again" 
 You wanna talk to the kid? Enter this ten digit grid 
 I'll explain to you what I did 
 +702-386-5397+, call, leave a message 
 Y'all niggaz can't rap, so why you wanna go and do that? 
 You move the crowd, I move the map 
 The defiant mad Lion, triumph over the rulers of Zion 
 Fuck your +Blood Diamonds+, I'd rather laugh dyin' 
 Miners in the mine shaft cryin' 
 +Apocalypto+ from GTMO, I clash with the last Mayans 
 The Sun Stone science, the black, red and blue alliance 
 Jump through the fire, you'd be a fool to try it 
 The fire suit don't fit, NO SHIT! 
 My Saratoga Suit got a customized grip 
 With a bat wing released from both wrist and both feet 
 Blazing hot, but I don't feel no heat 
 Hip-Hop's Master Chief, "Here, have a seat" 
 In the mic booth where I hang slabs of meat 
 Before, during, or after the debrief 
 I'll crack your teeth, don't talk unless you asked to speak 
 The Rift Valley Fever symptoms could last for weeks 
 We call it 'Hell in a Cell', watch the bastard tweak 
 Reach 80° degrees North, 14° degrees East 
 Beneath the ice sheet lies the Spitzberg Beast 
 Transmission distorted, injuries reported 
 Mission aborted, follow your orders, move forward 
 BRAVO! I fell in love with Suzanne Malveaux 
 On the down-low, now you know 
 She talked to the Canibus man 
 Code name: +Javelin Fangz+ 
 With +Nothing to Prove+ to the rap fans 
 Could elaborate further but suffice to say 
 "Goddamn that emcee made my day" 
 He's a butcher, a baker, a vapor box maker from Jamaica 
 Still talkin' trash to the haters 
 I'll clash with the greatest, this is major manual labor 
 Beta test the data with blue lasers 
 Canibus wave analysis, +Nothing to Lose+ in Los Angeles 
 Suing Hip-Hop for the damages 
 G-force: 10.4 
 Still conscious, but not for long 
 Missile lock-on, stop the song
