(Canibus) 
 Yo 
 I try to enjoy my life with paranoid nights 
 I absorb what I write through the orb of light 
 Stand next to the high temperature oven, get sucked in 
 Fire ya brain and half a dozen Cerebellum muffins 
 When I start to spit you twitch, eyes itch 
 Die quick like an open-mouthed formaldehyde kiss 
 Now you can really say you outta' your mind 
 You alive but your internal organs be outside 
 Scattered across the southside, cause you ran out of rhymes 
 Cut you down to size, fan you with the wings of a fly 
 Jadakiss wanna know why, well so do I 
 The whole world's a big lie and I think I'm inside 
 Now and again, I transform into the fountain head 
 Spinnin' from within, Howard roark with a fountain pen 
 The spirit of Eva Braun on my lawn at dawn 
 I was calm but I still told the bitch she don't belong 
 Try to fathom who wrote the song 
 Try to imagine the passion it takes to grab a mic with a broken arm 
 A message to my brothers, a simple and invisible ink color 
 'Cause big brother got things covered 
 Bless Phathom, you don't have to search for this no more 
 A piece of your core has now been completed, carry on 
 Whenever I spit bars three quarters of Special Forces pause 
 They wanna see what comes out of my jaws 
 Keep searching for Colonel Kirks till he put you in a world of hurt 
 One air strike leave your whole world burnt 
 Apocalypse now, I dictate you copy it down 
 Ancient poetry delivered from a modern day mouth 
 Raid your house with a bull horn, call your name out 
 Shish kabob your head from the side, then pull your brains out 
 Make a piggy bank skull, get change from your mouth 
 Make a nice leather pouch with the remainder of your scalp 
 Change it around, rewind it, drop fifty frames out 
 Explain how you disappeared before the movie came out 
 The damage is collateral 
 I let family members on the battlefield, just so they can find the other half of you 
 I recruited you, my battle groups smash your troops 
 Trap you in a everlasting loop 
 "C" to the third power, Crooked I, Chino Xl 
 With Canibus, try to Phathom the smell 
 Mothafucka!
