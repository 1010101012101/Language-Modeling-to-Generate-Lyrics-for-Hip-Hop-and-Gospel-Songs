<Singsong> 
 My crew (4X) 
 (Cheeks) 
 Yo yo now now now now 
 When I wake up before I gather up my pens 
 I shine up my fronts I give a Dutch for all my mens 
 Throw on some Marvin Gaye 
 I smoke my weed and clean my kitchen dishes 
 Tec to the sky see how mom's is always bitchin' 
 I'm done buffin' got my cheese my pen and paper 
 It's time for me here to prepare my caper 
 I written it down the line and now a ring is on my phone 
 It's my nigga Spigg Nice he tellin' me he in the zone 
 Yo I got the liquor the grain fool let's make a tape 
 I'm caught up in my own zone can't really escape 
 I ran it down the line as Easy Mo played the song 
 He checked my five he said to me yo later on 
 About an hour passes 
 About my loosey deuce deuce and my tinted glasses 
 I got the bike that I copped from my younger cousin 
 Cause that cat is up in class like a nickel and he wasn't 
 I'm concentratin' on these moves that I'ma soon be makin' 
 And once I break then I'ma show my peeps that I'm not fakin' 
 See my man Pop or Die from the block 
 Niggas wearin' ? reverse as we handle barred it to the block 
 See certain situations happen 
 When you caught up in the 'hood in the game of rappin' 
 You see scrappin' now leads to cappin' 
 We used to have each other's back 
 What the fuck happened? Stupid 
 Yo fuck it 
 Anyway Mary ?Easter? record store 
 Walked to the back now let me get a four 
 Exit from the spot everybody know what's hot 
 You get yours on and soon as you see 'em 
 The thieves turn the block 
 Jump on them right now when niggas chillin' 
 If you ever sported it you know how I'm feelin' 
 Cracked open my St. Ides took a squig 
 As Mama Blackwell whispered 
 You got it this time 
 He represents my Crew 
 You represent my Crew 
 We represent my Crew 
 Represent your Crew 
 He represents my Crew 
 You represent my Crew 
 We represent my Crew 
 Yo represent yours Crew 
 (A+) 
 Which one of y'all think you ill enough to bust A+ 
 Get crushed by the stampede of the elephant tusks 
 We LB families niggas don't understand us 
 Lyrical scanner diagnosin' niggas with cancer 
 You got a problem I got the answer 
 Twin Glocks goin' bananas 
 Buckin' innocent bystanders son 
 The total sum is a mathmatical function 
 I used to get suspended for keepin' the class jumpin' 
 Had the blackboard with the chalk in my hand 
 Mr. Cheeks snatched the thieves off the Canibus plan 
 Watched the crowd get amped 
 While they scream and chant 
 It's ill hot they can't keep still like a fire drill 
 We desire mils from 97 until 
 Firin' high caliber steel on this battlefield 
 Son,

 Campstead is my Crew 
 Parkside is my Crew 
 Lost Boyz is my Crew 
 Group Home is my Crew 
 Everyone is my Crew 
 Reebok's my Crew 
 It's worldwide my Crew 
 (Canibus) 
 Strictly out for the fortune and fame 
 I entertain for my personal gain 
 Rock the gold chains 
 Big enough to cause neck pains 
 Canibus is my name 
 I be the last one to set it 
 You could find my name 
 In the Lost Boyz album credits 
 If you open up and look at the cover 
 You'll see Cop killin' Queens in this mothafucker 
 And we all represent the Group Home click 
 L-O-S-T B-O-Y-Z for the 96 
 And as the clock ticks record sales climb 
 I remember when them niggas first got signed 
 Fuckin' with Uptown bustin' they ass e'ryday 
 From "Lifestyles" to "Jeeps" to "Renee" 
 Now they gettin' mad airplay all over New York 
 Top ten on ya Soundscan report 
 Yo who woulda thought these four 
 Nappy headed niggas woulda got a article in Billboard 
 For hard work produces results 
 And I'ma keep rockin' till the day 
 Somebody stops my pulse 
 So yo tally up it's the Lost Boyz Crew
