I sit on a throne of mastodon bones 
 I hear slaves moan tryna master the poem 
 Arms fold into bar codes while programs probe the unknown mold of the old 
 Live in the flesh, 50 reps of 5 sets, gimme Melly Mel biceps 
 I advise why test, I twist the 5-5-6, body armor inside the chest 
 Scouts dismount search hideouts from the south 
 I know the supply routes inside out 
 Timeout, sign-in wild out, the connection died out, time to sign-out 
 Thin recruits, black boots and ninja suits (shoot!) 
 My shot group injure two troops, I alleyoop boots on the roof 
 Crawl into mach suits count ta two and drop through 
 Fit, dog shaped, chiseled from the face to my waist 
 SWOL like a log in the lake upstate, custom plates 
 Rotate to one that's fake long enough to run to the base 
 Mask over the face escape, report to Peter Pace 
 The Blackhawk ten minutes late 
 Little birds hover in space, pick me up, we celebrate 
 I greet'em with a brotherly embrace 
 My safe zone is a space dome 
 USA made mold brain insulated with foam 
 Asphalt frequent flyer, ex Navy Seal diver 
 Strike a fire in sidewinders 
 Driftin' through dividers on four tires 
 Forced to retire from my roll over priors 
 The snake whisperer, the ripper of your viscera 
 Tongue blisterer with whisker burns (still at work?)
