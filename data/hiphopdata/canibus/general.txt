I got a beat sensitive style, just crossed the infinite mile 
 Always had this gift as a child 
 To write poetry, if I ever dip through ya town 
 Then you know it's me, Canibus be ripping it down 
 Bitches blowing me, fighting over licking it down 
 I hold on to they thong start striping it down 
 If I cough in my fist when I open my hand 
 There be dope in my hand that's how dope a nigga am 
 Canibus just entered the building y'all 
 If ya looking for the illest start filming y'all 
 The iron clad nomad my flow smash rip up the whole jam 
 When I leave the audience hold hands 
 Hand ya face back to you pleasantly 
 For thinking anything less of me then you better be Hennessey 
 Or make me pull up on a moped, blast off ya whole head 
 While ya man is yelling code Red I reload again 
 It made ya man stop talking 
 Its hard to see the white meat after I hot sauce him 
 It's not about paper I'm not talking 
 20 million a movie, I still rob the fucking box office 
 Strap the visor gold with it 
 An inverted gold rodeo flow will give you flow sickness
