(Canibus) 
 Yo, Yo 
 If I had half as many bars in gold, as I had in lyrics when I flowed 
 I'd be the richest man on the globe 
 Niggas want to know, "Is Canibus gold?" 
 That's a stupid ass question, motherfucker, is Canada cold? 
 By the thousand degrees lower than liquid nitro is 
 Five-thousand degrees hotter than flame-throwers 
 I reflect light, bounce off walls and wreck mics 
 Disconnect your windpipe, by cutting your neck with a knife 
 Rip through, everything from tissues to blood vessels 
 My ninjitsu, kill you with the art of Tenchu 
 I zigzag, zig, crushing the kid 
 With G-forces violent enough to crush your ribs like pilots that fly Russian MIG 
 Coming to punish you pigs 
 Give a fuck who you is, nigga, Canibus'll get biz 
 From the lowest point on the planet, to Mount Everest 
 I kick the illest shit, spray painting my name across the pyramids 
 The rap terrorist, Professor Emeritus 
 Fuck forbidden fruit, I was eating pussy in Genesis 
 (Canibus) 
 Fuck y'all 
 Fuck y'all 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, Yo 
 Now I said it once, and I'll say it a thousand times 
 I got thousands of rhymes, the rechargeable alkaline kind 
 You want a piece of mind? Fine, we can take it outside 
 Otherwise you're wasting you time, 'cause I'ma shine, for the one triple-nine 
 Niggas gambling, damaged they eyes 
 Going blind, trying to keep up with these lyrical lines 
 The type of nigga you can't flow behind without a dope rhyme 
 You fuck around and get close-lined till you nosedive 
 We can rhyme fair and square or fair in the sphere 
 Any place, anywhere, you niggas don't have a prayer 
 'Cause Doomsday is near, faggot niggas is scared 
 They stand and stare as I appear upon a cushion of air 
 With a long white beard flaming, hot enough to sunburn Satan 
 Hotter than white people taking vacations 
 Out in Jamaica, out in the sun-bathing 
 Sun-baking in gamma-ray radiation till they skin color look Cajun 
 Mother fuckers start ageing, to the point where they faces 
 Shrivel up like raisins and they become cancer patients 
 (Canibus) 
 Fuck y'all 
 Fuck y'all 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo, Yo, Yo 
 I manipulate the metaphysical power to hold my breath for half an hour 
 Continuously breathing outwards 
 You ain't an emcee, you a coward 
 I make wack rappers lose control of they bladders and piss in trousers 
 Pink pussy possum niggas play dead, while my heatwaves hit 
 And verbal X-rays evaporate shit 
 Water molecules get transformed to vapours 
 My lyrics turn the Pacific into a dry lakebed 
 Electromagnetic cassettes melt tape decks 
 Niggas battling space, trying to hold it down, but they can't 'cause they weightless 
 Amateur swordsmen get stabbed through they face mesh trying to escape death 
 A world where the whole globe will contract Ebola 
 From drinking spring-water darker than Coca-Cola 
 Humans with AIDS, computers with Y2K 
 I rock rhymes counter-clockwise until Doomsday 
 Fuck y'all, fuck y'all, fuck y'all
