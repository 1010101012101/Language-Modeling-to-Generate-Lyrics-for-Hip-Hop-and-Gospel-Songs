 (Canibus) 
 Yo, Yo 
 To all the female fans that want a backstage pass 
 You gotta let me caress your mammary glands, with my bare hands 
 The tickets will be there in advance 
 Waiting for you in the dressing room, with a half-a-dozen Guinness beer cans 
 About to go on stage, with Mr. McKnight 
 Kicking it to a chick about his height 
 Bragging to the girl how I rip mics 
 It's a quarter to twelve, and I'm going on at midnight 
 Shorty looking at me real bashful 
 Like, "Canibus there's something I gotta ask you, can I please see your tattoo?" 
 Damn, I feel the hypenitis setting in 
 Everybody questioning, asking if I can get them in 
 Time for action, the crowd starts clapping 
 Put the DAC in, my man Ron G scratching 
 Twenty-two hundred people packing in 
 To a venue with a twelve hundred capacity maximum 
 Where you at Brian? 
 Yo 
 To the, tick-tock you don't stop 
 Can-I-Bus will blow up your whole spot 
 Yo 
 I go from being on stage with a lion, to rocking with Brian 
 A storm that's hardcore but silent 
 I grip mics tighter than pliers with hands 
 Turn the club into a giant frying pan 
 Put a fireman into a situation with a temperature, higher than 
 He could probably withstand, you understand? 
 If you ever try to get fly, you'll get electrified, and fried 
 And mess around and get your mouth slapped dry 
 You can battle me, and possibly survive 
 But you could never see me, and walk away without a black eye 
 Word up hop, I got emcees calling the cops 
 And when the cops ain't trying to see, the cops call S.W.A.T. 
 I scar your whole squad with bullet scars 
 No holds barred, I'll even hassle the National Guard 
 Ready or Not, like the Fugees, crews be, stepping to me 
 But I wipe them all out like Booty 
 I'm so unruly, the police won't say nothing to me 
 It don't matter whether they on, or off duty 
 I run through a line of brave-men, like X-Rays through skin 
 And kill the competition to win 
 What?
