Chorus: Canibus 
 There's nothing left to sacrifice, Rip the Jacker will attack the mic 
 Si Development will crash your satellite 
 We micro manage our stanzas, spit answers to questions they ask us 
 We are gods on the mic not rappers 
 I like it slow too, something I can flow to 
 It makes it easier to remember what I wrote to 
 How many times I done told you? 
 I only feel social when I spit vocals, let me show you 
 The phantom of a monster, a monster of the opera 
 With no mask and Iron Man / Doctor Doom armour 
 Infra red, one spotter 
 Gatling gun shot down your soldiers like terracotta statues in Nicaragua 
 The hubris of the humans, they overlooked the music 
 With alternative futures, only concerned with acoustics 
 I wrote a rhyme that was infinite, the Brotherhood proved it 
 The formula was conducive, an evolution in music 
 Some misconstrued it, said it was bullshit but they can't stop the movement 
 One thousand three hundred mixes later we still producing new shit 
 Canibus spit intelligent statements, describing every constellation 
 Every manifestation 
 We are the gods in human form, a pyro-telekinetic human torch 
 I pour my bars over the music 'til it hardens 
 Chorus: Canibus 
 There's nothing left to sacrifice, Rip the Jacker will attack the mic 
 Si Development will crash your satellite
