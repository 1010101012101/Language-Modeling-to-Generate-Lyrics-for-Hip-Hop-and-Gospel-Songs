(Canibus) 
 Aiyo I move like my shadow is weightless 
 Expose myself like a faceless, plastic surgery patient 
 Transmitting from an undisclosed location 
 Pirate stations with phantom frequency modulations 
 My throat-pistol spit ghost-signals 
 And you never get the antidote from me, 'cause I bit you 
 Slap you with a jagged crystal, 'cause my energy emit through 
 Anything metallic, even a pencil 
 Feel the bush burn, turn your cornrow into a good perm 
 My flat-feet with no curves squish worms 
 The bad news is I got a tight flow 
 The good news is I just switched to Geico 
 This is Hip-Hop nigga 
 Listen to the voice go drip-drop nigga 
 Swimmers in my saliva river drown when I give it to them 
 The hemispheres of my brain got a river through it; gray-matter fluid 
 The mic is a spark-plug 
 When I grab it, I glow, come with that Edelbrock carburetor flow 
 When I choke back the yolk full-throttle and go for broke 
 I've become a G.O.A.T. ripper on a positive note 
 (Canibus) 
 Waves engulfed my boat but I managed to float 
 Swim to the coast, make a new ark from oak 
 Build a bonfire and smoke, pounds of 'dro 
 My own rhyme scarred my throat, torn is how I'll be remembered by most 
 From now till the day that I croak
