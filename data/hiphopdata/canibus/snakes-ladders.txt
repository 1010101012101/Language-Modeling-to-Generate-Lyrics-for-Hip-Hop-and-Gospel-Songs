Canibus) 
 Yo 
 I stand outside the gates of Buckingham Palace, selling reefer 
 Puffing a chalice with the beef eaters 
 Getting so high that whenever I drop shit 
 It'll land on the window of your airplane cockpit 
 Structurize with the hot shit, crazy I click 
 Niggas is bloody idiots thinking that they can stop this 
 I'll increase my strength, to a super human extent 
 Nigga your rhyme ain't worth six pence 
 And if you can hear, smell, see, touch, and taste 
 Then you don't need six senses to feel me punch you in the face 
 From Princeton, to Clapham Common, my lyrics invade Europe like Joseph Stalin 
 And murder niggas for rhyming 
 Spitting fire, with gasoline for saliva 
 Drunk as Lady Diana's driver with reporters behind her 
 Alcohol in the hands of a minor 
 I got you panicking like bombs, with thirty second timers 
 Clear the building, evacuate women and children 
 Fuck what you feeling nigga I came here to kill them 
 Straight shitting, from New York to Great Britain 
 And when we do shows we make the queen pay admission 
 What?
