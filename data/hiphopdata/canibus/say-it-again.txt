(Canibus) 
 Nneka, I can't believe you 'Living Single' like Latifah 
 When you're the only reason I even bought a beeper 
 You got me scheming and fiending _____ demons 
 The only thing between me and sin is ya G-String 
 Ain't nothing that I wouldn't do to get with a 
 Dark skinned blackberry molasses type of sister 
 And at your own risk you can get on top of me 
 But from that moment on you be Canibus property 
 (Nneka) 
 Baby something bout your love 
 I just can't take it 
 Always seem to know just what to say to me 
 No one comes before you lady 
 Give you everything you need and more 
 I need to be sure 
 Say It Again 
 (Chorus: Nneka) 
 I've been waiting 
 All this time anticipating 
 You Say It Again 
 I've been waiting 
 All this time anticipating 
 You Say It Again 
 (Nneka) 
 I still feel your voice it runs right through me 
 I can't seem to get you out my head 
 All those things you said 
 All those things you said 
 Nothing in the world could shake it 
 Nothing comes before you lady 
 Give you everything you need and more 
 I need to be sure 
 With all the time we spend every now and then 
 I need to know I'm your only love, the only one for you 
 Baby tell me what I want to hear 
 Don't be shy, let me know 
 Baby baby say you love me again 
 (Canibus) 
 I used to have you in Atlantic City cashing chips 
 A hundred square yard garage with flashy whips 
 Deep down inside I'm the man you missed 
 Handsome like Malik Yoba, without the ashy lips 
 Whenever we made love it was passionate 
 But when I popped the question, you never answered it 
 But I'ma still get you, 'cause nobody can stop me 
 I take you to court for the custody of your body 
 Canibus most wanted, who wanna get upon it 
 I lick you from your toes to your edible under garments 
 I promise, word to my unborn child, so baby, is you down? 
 We could do it Bow Wow style 
 (Chorus: Nneka) 
 I've been waiting 
 All this time anticipating 
 You Say It Again 
 I've been waiting 
 All this time anticipating 
 You Say It Again
