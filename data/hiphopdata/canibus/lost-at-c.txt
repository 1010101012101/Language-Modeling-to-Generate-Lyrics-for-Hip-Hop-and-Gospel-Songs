Yo, yo, yo, now when you see that big ass see, you know I'm comin' through 
 And when you know I'm comin' through, you know what I'ma do 
 I never sent to battlin me, would be impossible 
 I just think it's highly motherfucking improbable 
 You talkin' to a nigga, niggas split molecules 
 To subatomic particles, strong enough to stop a bull 
 Bodies slam, to oxygen, drop a mule 
 Urinating rocket fuel, freestylin over gospel tunes 
 Rhymes by the thousands, rhymes for hours 
 I could kick a rhyme longer than your whole album 
 Kickboxer, beatin' the shit out niggas proper 
 I beat 'em till they holler, beat 'em till the cops come 
 Beatin' niggas till they have seizures, beat 'em till they start screamin 
 Like fax machines when they start receivin 
 Beat 'em till my own hands start bleedin 
 Beat 'em till they lungs stop breathing and they heart stop beatin' 
 From 12 am to 12 pm in the evening 
 With three 15 minute breaks in between 'em 
 Good Jesus, that's a really stingy beatin' 
 That's what you get for fuckin' with this lyrical demon 
 Bloodstream's been, contaminated for eons 
 I got cast out of heaven for treason 
 Got cast out of the Garden of Eden for lettin the reptilian beast in 
 Got locked up for a DUI and speedin 
 A whole legion of half decent emcees get released when 
 They spit a hundred bars for they freedom 
 See I'm much too nice to compete wit 
 Too nice to flow over beats wit, too nice to hold a M I see wit 
 Off some diesel Hercules shit, I cold flip 
 And start to punch trees till they leafless 
 Inhale with two real deep breaths, hold my breath 
 Till the whole planet suffocates and then release it [release it] 
 Yo, you ain't as cold as us 
 Or as bold as us 
 When you get thrown to the wolves, you get thrown to us 
 (When we in the warzone, we got the chrome wit us) 
 'Cause we rollin' rough, when the soldiers rush 
 Either you roll wit us, or get blown to dust [ashes to ashes and dust to 
 Dust] 
 Yo, yo, now for the last couple of months, things been real quiet 
 'Cause I ain't heard shit worth buyin 
 I'm bout to show you niggas how I'm driven 
 The drive comes from my lyrics and my lyrics come from my inner spirit 
 Five bringin' the, faster than 12 cylinder engines with nitrogen in 'em 
 Faster than F-1 with light pistons 
 Fast enough to give your brain an aneurysm 
 'Cause you niggas is slower than fat bitches with tabalism 
 The way I rip apart the competition when I be spittin' 
 The name Canibus might as well be Cannibalism 
 Show me a man that can't feel him 
 I'll show you a man that'll grab him by the neck 
 And put his head to the fan on the ceiling 
 Suffer real bad from television shit 
 Drop him off the roof of a building and let the news film him 
 I hop in front of the cameras and tell 'em how I'm feelin' 
 I tell 'em how I feel that hip hop, should deal wit it 
 Tell 'em how I'm tired of the state rappers in 
 Ninety percent of the shit that rappers give is subject matter less 
 Not original, but blasphemous, just a bunch of the same characters 
 Shootin the same videos, it's embarrassing 
 You's in the same formal as the level head? 
 You's are the same actors and actresses, same shit different laxative 
 Face it nigga you wack as shit I'm snatchin your mic 
 I make you run for your life, children in the daylight 
 That track you at night, my global position is satellite 
 Got a infrared blaster to test your body's Fahrenheit 
 Wherever you go, I track you through hail, sleet, or snow 
 I track you till you're seizure grows into a afro 
 Until you plaid 'em into cornrows 
 Track you till your shoe soles develop holes 
 And you get, corns on your toes 
 Till your teeth develop hollow coses 
 But you been goin' so long without deodorant you don't even notice it 
 Motherfucker
