Tranquility to infinity (Yeah) 
 Tranquility to infinity 
 Canibus is an animal with the mechanical mandible 
 Coming to damage you spitting understandable slang at you 
 I'm the all seeing lyrical with infinite bars and visuals 
 And the sideways eight peripheral 
 I told you I spit a rhyme that'll melt the Earth 
 Then ask you in the afterlife if you felt the verse 
 On Planet Earth I search for my Tranquility first 
 I said I was the illest but it didn't help me it hurt 
 And whenever I said, "Can-I", the crowd said, "Bus" 
 Ten years later who am I? I still got a passionate love 
 To be the man who I was, never give up 
 Irrational rush to crush every mic I clutch 
 When I erupt you duck or eggs clash flash solar blast from Bus 
 Then sweep you off the stage like crumbs 
 Grab your tongue, shout, rip it out, then shove it back in your mouth 
 NOW! Then tell you to spit it out 
 I spit about them lyrics my people can't live without 
 Been around since '97, I've been ripping it down 
 Spit track after track after 'Beast From the East' 
 I'm back before Lil' Weezy knew how to rap 
 When T.I. was still hustling crack, I put the muscle in rap 
 100 Bars, who fucking with that? 
 A thousand bars later I ain't heard nothing from Pap 
 Where you was at when I was giving Big Punisher dap? 
 On stage with a him at the Palladium 
 You was in a gymnasium, I was putting chainsaws to craniums 
 Blazing Homosapians in the atrium ripping jaws off aliens 
 Performing 'Channel Zero' in stadiums 
 Up at Hot 97' disgracing them 
 Any radio station they place me in I broke the break-beats in 
 I beat her, I beat him, the beat blend, I beat them 
 Spit a verse to beat Barrack Obama if he win 
 I'm the Beast From the East, picking meat out my teeth 
 And as soon as the beat stop I forget how to speak 
 I release a better rhyme seven times a week 
 To beat me you gotta be better than my last release 
 The bars rip ya face off, spit bars, spit shine ya skull 
 Till every rhyme you memorize is gone 
 Battle you for the respect in a battle to the death 
 Dial zero, call the operator ask for Bis 
 411 ask for RIP 
 555-1212, I rip the mic to shit 
 Before the Federal Communication Commission started a new division 
 With the intention to cripple our children 
 Mentally deficient from television 
 This radio programmer we listen to got to many elements missing 
 Lyricism and wisdom got overshadowed by the singing and blinging 
 Deceived by a system that's media driven 
 A made a vow that I would get them and bit them, then injected my venom 
 And for that? I was never forgiven my nigga 
 I let the rhythm hit them with a chemical algorithm 
 Liable to kill them if I ever get with them I rip them 
 The infinite monk, 'All Hail Can-I-Bus' 
 Then wake up to this 'Pure Uncut' 
 'How Many Emcees' do I have to bust? 
 'I'm A Patriot' with 'No Airplay' but 'How Come' 
 'My Block is Your Block', I throw it up with 'Doo Wop' 
 I'm the "Enemy of the State" of Hip Hop 
 'Indibisible', Indestructible, 'Canibustible' 
 The 'Adversarial Theatre Justice' judging you 
 Tired of you posers, I'm the rap superstar soldier on a poster 
 'Captain Cold Crush' 
 Tuck the heat before I brush the teeth 
 The athlete at the track meet with rusty cleats 
 Artillery like lawn mowers with four motors and four rotors 
 Look like a mom with four strollers 
 Counterstrike like 'Black Kobra' 
 With gasoline in the Super Soaker, walk over, I'll roast ya!
