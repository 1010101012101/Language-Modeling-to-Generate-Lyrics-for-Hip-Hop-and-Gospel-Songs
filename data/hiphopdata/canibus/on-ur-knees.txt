(Intro: Canibus) 
 Show you what I seen 
 I hear voices 
 Show you what I mean 
 JYNXT is the name 
 (Canibus) 
 I said JYNXT is the name but you can call me Prince Germaine 
 Watch me change through my fits of rage 
 When the turrets syndrome phase is engaged 
 I attract the gaze of a million eyes transfixed on stage 
 "Good things come to those who wait" 
 Bullshit, I say better things come to those who chase 
 Concentrate get your mind right 
 Take a quantum leap of faith into the blind light, aiyo listen to this 
 I spit it I spurt it, I bake it I burned it 
 I take it, I earned it, I leave your brain maked and nervous 
 Cussing and cursing, I slither when I'm swerving 
 Like a Chinese serpent, your muscles are hurting, The poison is working 
 (Canibus) 
 I hear them voices but the vision is missing 
 Telling me to put my fist in but I won't listen 
 My life's like the 'Passion of Christ' 
 They give me lashings in the middle of town square just for grabbing the mic 
 I rare species of EMCEE 
 When I open my mouth, the breeze makes my teeth lean 
 Muscles expand rip through jeans, people scream 
 God-damn I knew Canibus the Supreme 
 Give me the mic I show you what I mean 
 Lay your hand on the middle of your forehead and show you what I mean 
 You never seen the best before 
 You never seen the great Canibussolini in the fresh before 
 Over the phone they ask me, "where are you?" 
 "I'm in my summerhouse, drinking sparkling water, finishing my novel" 
 This one's about a family in Kabul 
 That was killed when a shell from the sky had bombed their school 
 Waiting for the book to go to print soon 
 Got my man Nottz from VA sending me tracks to spit to 
 I hear voices
