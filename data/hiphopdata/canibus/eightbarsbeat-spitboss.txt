(Canibus) 
 You step into the room, you smell your own doom 
 What you gonna do? We're emcees just like you 
 Speak, spit to the beat, it shouldn't take long 
 Look at me, this is what the underground means 
 This is what is to be expected with no direction 
 A probe was sent to get an answer for a question in a sentence 
 Placed over the beat, the way it was presented 
 Not to mention what ever I recommended when the verse ended 
 So strange, a congregating place for no names 
 Worth their own weight in gold in the game 
 Me Usain 
 We talked about Canibus but not talked about Saint Germaine 
 Kick down the door like, "Honey I'm home" 
 Then pass out right after I say, "Honey I'm stoned" 
 If this is not the best, it is slightly less 
 Lord Finesse in the flesh spit a bar per request 
 (Chorus x2: Canibus) 
 Eight Bars gave me the beat, I black out 
 The Bar Bar Black Sheep, this is customised heat 
 Eight Bars gave me the beat, I black out 
 The Bar Bar Black Sheep, this is customised heat 
 (Canibus) 
 I feel as if everything I've learned 
 Has made be obsolete before I could even say one word 
 What I said it not what you heard or what you thought you observed 
 The vision is getting blurred but you have to be sure 
 Spin into a turn, go over the curb 
 Explode over the earth, tossed from the vehicle, rolling in the dirt 
 You are hurt, paramedics didn't notice you first 
 Blood gushing from the puncture wound hole in your shirt 
 What does it feel like to be a rap legend 
 That is never mentioned, no matter what he has invented? 
 What were his inventions? He built a place where the beats can be tested 
 Captured, tagged, released, re-edited 
 Underground manure rap from the sewer rat 
 Uploading your beat, I vocal it and shoot it back 
 Captured, tagged, released, the microphone Beast from the East 
 Canibus clones running through the streets
