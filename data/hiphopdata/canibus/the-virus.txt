Thunderdome laboratory, hundreds of poems 
 Inject the music hormones into my spongy bone 
 The human genome altered by very high frequency notes 
 Frequently flow till it completely unfolds 
 To be announced: TBA, my junk-DNA 
 AK74 out front of the VMAs 
 Run the VIN from the DOD in DMV 
 Run like DMC, call me MC DMT 
 First brigade 25th replacement ID 
 I'm your worst nightmare in the flesh, times three 
 Rhymes metastasize from the inside 
 Until whatever is inside dies, the Virus is alive 
 Psychic assassins take vaccination tablets 
 In case they come in contact with contaminated rappers 
 On a matchbox laptop, in the face pocket's a padlock 
 Trade OP commander used to be a cabscot 
 Absorb beams of lights, feed off obscene rights 
 The more you say be nice the more I want to fight 
 I don't want to hear shit about the legislation for climate change 
 That's for people who own private planes 
 With private aims, yeah they all the same 
 Playing mind games, the enemy blows out privates brains 
 Commentary unimportant, I don't see the purpose of talkin' 
 So many haters at the crossroad, I can't cross it 
 Snakes don't walk and shadows don't talk 
 That's what we all thought but we thought wrong 
 The beef was off, public relations conduct peace talks 
 Eat the gun and tell me if it needs more salt 
 The verbal assault virus leads edutainment 
 Amadeus the Stampede and Canibus behind it
