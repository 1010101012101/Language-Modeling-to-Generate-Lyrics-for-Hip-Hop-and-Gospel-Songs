 Aight yo 
 Let's talk about the incredible rap flow 
 We can have a 'Dinner for Five' with John Favreau 
 See, it comes to me natural 
 One of my integral attributes is to be lyrically tactful 
 I can prove who's nice and who's not an emcee 
 Through falsifiable scientific hypotheses 
 In recent times I find it's never been about the rhymes 
 The game is very politicized 
 Those who sympathize with they hearts and minds 
 Show hatred through the mouth, body language and eyes 
 Sometimes I say to myself, 'Why do I even try?' 
 In spite of whatever happens I'll love it till I die 
 (Canibus) 
 If you don't believe in other dimensions, you've been duped 
 They're the main-ingredients in this cosmic soup 
 See the mouse? Grab it! 
 Edit the edges with Avid 
 Is this the picture of a duck or a rabbit? 
 You see ass and tits? Welcome to madness 
 Please try to interpret the following passage 
 Magneto-hydrodynamic mechanics 
 Translated into Canibus' language you'll never understand it 
 It's on when the crowd is cheering me on 
 Waving their arms like they're doing Falun Gong 
 Firearms three-quarters of a million troops strong 
 In a single file line stretched out a mile long 
 Thermodynamics of the second law 
 Isolated physical systems lead toward greater disorder 
 Across the dry desert in the featureless sand 
 Water is secondary to the meaning of man 
 I know but I won't tell 
 It's more to the human race than polymers, proteins and protocells 
 Chemical evolution 
 L and D form sub-units 
 That come from the love of Hip Hop and rap music 
 (Canibus) 
 The scourge of the words I attack the Earth with 
 I bet you submerge dry and emerge wet, what you think? 
 Confuse my shrink with English the publication refuses to print 
 My daughter likes blue and my son likes pink, man, give me a drink 
 What kind of world are we living in? I think it stinks 
 Whatever life you live it's a quick sighted quiz 
 If you perceive something to be real, maybe it is 
 Force your kids to listen to Dead Prez before they go to bed 
 Send them to school, put them in Special Ed 
 Reinforce their paranoia of the fed's 
 Make sure they grow dreads and they live on the edge 
 The philosophy of the hard-knocks 
 Pan-psychics sit on the block and attempt to talk to rocks 
 In the projects where they harvest the human crop 
 Organic robots that bleed when they get shot 
 If you can survive or thrive in the Jamaican ghetto 
 You deserve the Congressional Medal 
 My heart goes out to all the young bloods 
 The heart has reasons the mind knows not of 
 From the first to the twelfth month 
 I keep a twelve-pump in the trunk for the day when Hell comes 
 Was invincible on the mic when I held one 
 My motto was to blaze all and spare none 
 "I came, I saw, I conquered": Now there's just an empty void 
 Mic Club! Come holla at your boy!
