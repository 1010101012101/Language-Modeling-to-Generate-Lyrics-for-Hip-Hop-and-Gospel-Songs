(Canibus) 
 Come in Dagga this is Cloak, check the flow 
 PXO start the countdown to Ground Zero 
 Yo, Brother J I bust the AK 
 I salute you at Perai West and wait for the day 
 Canibus commandment, 'The Eagle has landed' 
 Those who don't understand it will be left stranded 
 Face down in a sandpit I wait for the riot 
 On a mountain lion meat diet, eat and be quiet 
 Five murks low tide, high surf in the dirt 
 I curse and burp like Wyatt Earp 
 We can't sleep, feel pain but can't weep 
 Brother J got the M3P on full sweep 
 Outside the wire, flat tire, fuel truck on fire 
 A hundred and eighty days to retire 
 Return From Mecca, 80k tax free 
 Escalade upgrade, one IED from the grave 
 Once a day we drink Gatorade in the shade 
 While Special Ed plays, I got it made 
 The guy who tried to shoot me looked like Gary Busey 
 The whole crew salute me, the news interviewed me 
 I write under chem lights, the same colour ten types 
 The pen tip strikes, the mic burst into life 
 I lowered the ramp, PXO climbed aboard with his man 
 With dried haemoglobin on his pants 
 Low pressure suppressants, sound like twin-engine Cessnas 
 Effective thrust leaves you breathless 
 The spirit of Pac atop of Mount Ziggurat 
 In Iraq with his own Thug Paradise block 
 Hip Hop's GW Prescott battle 'til breath stop 
 In the death box, let's not 
 Yo, come in Dagga this is Cloak, check the flow 
 PXO start the countdown to Ground Zero 
 Yo, Brother J I bust the AK 
 I salute you at Parai West and wait for the day 
 Return from Mecca, the Ground Zero inspectors
