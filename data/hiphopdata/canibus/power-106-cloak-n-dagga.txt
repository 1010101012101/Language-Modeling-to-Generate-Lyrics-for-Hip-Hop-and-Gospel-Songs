Opposites attract, parallels repel 
 Send me to hell just gimme my fan mail 
 The Grand Theft Auto, role model 
 My golden vocal ensemble make the globe wobble 
 Last tour on earth, ultra sound before the birth 
 Take you to church, dump you in a hole in the dirt 
 I scrub my ass with water on the rag 
 Got hit with a mortar frag 
 They gave me a loratab 
 Cat that walked in with a Chaplain, they asked me what happen 
 I told him I was... 
 He asked me if I drank, thank but no thanks 
 My hands... Hooked up to both tanks 
 Cat-eyes and Kevlar, couldn't get far in the dense fog 
 Come in red bull this is red dog 
 We'll boot you, re-boot you, blindfold you and shoot you 
 The black Gaharu with a bluetooth 
 The hazmat suit for the avian flute 
 12 Head Trauma recruits, robion boots 
 Double decker, triple wrecker, quadruple clever quintuplets 
 Senses collected for seven enders 
 8 wonders, 9 numbers, 10 budgets 
 11 rubbers found in the rubish 
 I got a dozen lovers 
 Call my name, not Canibus, but Germaine 
 That's why I crawled out the grave 
 Head Trauma records, 13 methods and who the best is? 
 Don't as questions just spit
