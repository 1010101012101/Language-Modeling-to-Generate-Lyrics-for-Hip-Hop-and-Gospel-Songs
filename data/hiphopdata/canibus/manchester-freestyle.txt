Canibus is like the spirit of Pac atop Mount Ziggurat 
 In Iraq with his own Thug Paradise block 
 What did you come back for? 
 I come back for my rap tour, pronounced rap shore 
 Eat corn to memorialise how I was born 
 Burn trees to symbolise how I spawn 
 Spike Nod ointment in a Alabaster Jar, 
 With a logo that resembles the masters scar 
 My verse on the mic is a surge spike surgical strike 
 Vertical flight with submersible glowing lights 
 Speech hit you, deep tissue, breach bone gristle, 
 Like projectile penetrators from pistols, leave a bullet in you,
