 Yo 
 You better watch who you beef with 
 You might be walking down the street then, suddenly you hear tire screeching 
 Niggas'll be hoping with heat and 
 Throw you in the car-seat and leave your lady standing there screaming 
 The whole weekend, you get blindfolded and beaten 
 Nose-bleeding, gasping for air, wheezing 
 You got kidnapped and you don't even know the reason 
 We even called your fans for ransom, they said, 'keep him' 
 Watch who you beef with 
 (Canibus) 
 Yeah 
 It ain't no secret 
 Talking that street shit'll get you in some deep shit 
 See niggas know who you be with, where you be at 
 When you'll be gone, when you'll be back 
 All of my niggas got doctor degrees in thuganometry 
 We all know how to hold the heat properly 
 And how to conduct armed-robbery for personal property 
 And could go without food or water for twenty-four hours, at least 
 We fugitives, who ain't doing a bid 
 And shoot to live, even if it means leaving you for dead 
 'Cause niggas like you get scared, look for loopholes 
 Pick the phone up and dial nine, uno, uno 
 What happened to them cruel niggas that you talk about? 
 Them cruel niggas that you never walk without? 
 I know what happened, y'all heard about the double action 
 Portable gatling, and y'all don't want get blasted

 Yo 
 You better watch who you beef with 
 You might be walking down the street then, suddenly you hear tire screeching 
 Niggas'll be hoping with heat and 
 Throw you in the car-seat and leave your lady standing there screaming 
 The whole weekend, you get blindfolded and beaten 
 Nose-bleeding, gasping for air, wheezing 
 You got kidnapped and you don't even know the reason

 Ey yo 
 We run up in radio stations on some unannounced shit 
 Catch the DJ off guard and round-house him 
 Duck tape his mouth then, put a pound to his gut 
 And force him to play five cuts off the up-and-coming album 
 Just the way I planned it, niggas'll start to panic 
 Brains get hijacked like planes'll crash landing 
 Bitch niggas pray to the Lord 
 The black box that was supposed to record, the pilot's voice got destroyed 
 So watch who you beef with, and watch who you suck your teeth at 
 It'll probably be something you regret 
 You'll get wet with horizontal rain droplets 
 Miniature rockets, coming out barrels of metal objects 
 Niggas get shot in the face, on the ground shaking like Tectonic plates 
 That cause earthquakes 
 Now you got your grill in the ground, how that dirt taste? 
 You shouldn't have started this shit in the first place 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 You better watch who you beef with 
 You might be walking down the street then, suddenly you hear tire screeching 
 Niggas'll be hoping with heat and 
 Throw you in the car-seat and leave your lady standing there screaming 
 The whole weekend, you get blindfolded and beaten 
 Nose-bleeding, gasping for air, wheezing 
 You got kidnapped and you don't even know the reason 
 We even called your fans for ransom, they said, 'keep him' 
 Watch who you beef with 
 (Canibus) 
 'Cause niggas is coming to get you, ready to rip you 
 With intercontinental ballistic-missiles and pistols 
 Put a red dot on your head like you Hindu 
 Then put a hole in you big enough to put my open fist through 
 We can verbally diss you, or we can get physical 
 Whatever niggas want to do, we can do it too 
 'Cause you a sinner, I'm a sinner, we all sinners 
 We've robbed niggas for they presents at they Bar Mitzvahs 
 We've robbed niggas for they body organs 
 And sold them to the highest bidders, things like hearts and livers 
 One and a half million in cash when it's delivered 
 Then go to Yom Kippur and beg for God to forgive us 
 See you the type that, finds violence real frightening 
 And holds your crucifix tighter when shells is firing 
 Sitting by your bed perspiring, trying to crawl underneath it 
 You need to watch who you beef with 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 You better watch who you beef with 
 You might be walking down the street then, suddenly you hear tire screeching
