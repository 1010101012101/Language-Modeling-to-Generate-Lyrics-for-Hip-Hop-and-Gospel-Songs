Wake up! Nowadays there is no such thing as snitching 
 Satellites and cameras watching and listening 
 How many people know the world they live in? 
 Technology is king, biometric scanning skin let you in 
 Unorthodox paradox iron locked hiphop inside it's echovox, believe it or not! 
 The western world is not conscious, but spiritual steril 
 Impell, one thousand dollars a barell, but how? 
 Good and evil converse, the reaction is like hot magma and icebergs 
 Try to find the right words, to describe what I observes 
 So much to unlearn, that's a subterm so how do I explain what occurs? 
 The reversal of the magnetism in the solar system 
 Nothing can be taken, everything must be given 
 That way nothing will ever go missing, and we can continue our mission 
 Spitting tripple digit tempest lyrics 
 But you can't hear it, but still... 
 Power struggle to the finish 
 Hip hop was not made for the timid 
 But you can't criticise it if you don't live it 
 Myriad of MC's opens up a vortex, creating a vortech of (?) 
 Canibus at the speed of C, the exponential factor is me 
 Call the greek, (canibus) Robbie G 
 The exponential factor is me, a MC Robbie G 
 Wake up before we knock you out of sleep
