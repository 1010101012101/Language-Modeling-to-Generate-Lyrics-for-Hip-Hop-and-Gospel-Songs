(Canibus) 
 I'll punish you, slash you with serrated blades 
 I'll punish you, watch your breath fade away 
 I'll punish you, send you to that big pie in the sky 
 When I'm finished with you, you'll be dying to die 
 Motherfucker, I'll demolish you, steal your corpse from the hospital 
 Smuggle you home, and polish you 
 If I want to get you, I'll get you with a Daisy Cutter missile 
 So I don't know why you got a nine with you 
 I'll punish you, slash you with serrated blades 
 I'll punish you, watch your breath fade away 
 I'll punish you, send you to that big pie in the sky 
 When I'm finished with you, you'll be dying to die 
 I gave you the options, allowed you to choose 
 Gave you a style you could use 
 Now you fucking with some grimy dudes 
 Your blood could end up on the bottom of shoes 
 If you was rich, I still wouldn't share a dollar with you 
 I didn't know stigmata was true, did you? 
 I'll punish you, take you to the edge of your resolve 
 Punish you, present you with a problem that you can't solve 
 Punish you, because pain is your God 
 I put bars of galls between your bladder walls 
 I'll attack you all, punish you for what you are 
 Show you what a black hole could do to a star 
 I'll punish you
