The iron clad nomad, don't rip off the whole jam 
 When I leave, the audience hold hands 
 Canibus y'all, get with the program 
 Everytime my throat expand I get 4 grand 
 Out for the dough man, Imma no brand 
 30 seconds and I'm out the door man 
 A tally written up when I bust the flow man 
 It's all about devotion 
 I loved you first, you ain't love me back 
 Try to reconcile you ain't want me back 
 I'm not the type to bore you, divorce you 
 As soon as I get off you, I wanna finish what I start with you 
 The iron clad nomad, don't rip off the whole jam 
 When I leave, the audience hold hands 
 Canibus y'all, get with the program 
 Everytime my throat expand I get 4 grand 
 Out for the dough man, Imma no brand 
 30 seconds and I'm out the door man 
 A tally written up when I bust the flow man 
 It's all about devotion
