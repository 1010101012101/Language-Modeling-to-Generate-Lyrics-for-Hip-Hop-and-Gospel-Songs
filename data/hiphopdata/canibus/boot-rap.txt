I start to speak, a week means nothing 
 A month goes by, I'm still here busting 
 Years begin to fill the void, Lyrically they still scared of ya' boy 
 Prepare to deploy, your hearing is destroyed 
 Hello? Talk to the Feds, them hollows gon' talk to your head 
 Like a witchdoctor talks to the dead 
 Go in like SWAT, flashbangs hanging like dreadlocks 
 I forgot, I seen a swastika on his watch 
 He was stuck on saying stop, they shot him till he dropped 
 Went through his pockets and wallet for gwap 
 He realized he got popped and went into shock 
 They left him for the cops 
 By the time they got there they had to just get a mop 
 Mark Deez Iron Lung team two clean up crew 
 They teamed up, give me an on screen view 
 Canibus trigger finger bigger but why measure dick size with ya? 
 This is lyrical gigantism nigga 
 Walk around with fists up, fight an whole generation 
 Put a million observations into one conversation 
 With no education, my client has no statement and no explanation 
 He was attacked by an unknown assailant 
 You can see here his arms flailing, I don't care 
 Just nail them and impale them and blame it on aliens
