(Canibus) 
 I hear the voices, but the vision is missing 
 Telling me to find a face to put my fist in, but I won't listen 
 My life's like the Passion of Christ 
 They give me lashings in the middle of town square, just for grabbing the mic 
 A rare species of E.M.C.E.E. 
 When I open my mouth, the breeze makes my teeth lean 
 Muscles expand, rip through jeans 
 People scream, "God damn, I knew Canibus was supreme" 
 Give me the mic, I'll show you what I mean 
 Lay my hand on the middle of your forehead to show you what I seen 
 You never seen the best before 
 You never seen the great CaniMussolini in the flesh before 
 Over the phone, they ask me, "Where are you?" 
 "I'm in my summer house, drinking sparkling water, 
 Finishing my novel," this one's about a family in Kabul 
 That was killed when a shell from the sky had bombed the school 
 Waiting for the book to go to print soon 
 Got my man Nottz from V.A. sending me tracks to spit to 
 I hear voices, I hear voices
