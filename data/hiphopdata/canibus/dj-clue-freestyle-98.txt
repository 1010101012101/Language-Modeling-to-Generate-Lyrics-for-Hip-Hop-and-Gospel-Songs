I come with the 'Art of War' like Bone Thugs 
 Like nigga what, I'm thinking of getting a gun and stick 'em up 
 Then crush a thug's bones like a chrome slug 
 Leave you laying dead in your own blood 
 Foaming at the mouth like soap suds, see what the .44 does 
 You know what, I'm about to get mad as fuck 
 And blast you in the gut, you niggas ain't had enough? 
 I'm the scariest Sagittarius you ever seen 
 With genetically dominant genes, the supreme being 
 The fiends that rock men till I'm top of the top ten 
 After the 12 o'clock I guess worse than Rakim 
 Then I make your whole crew sweat my music 
 'Cause I do get in your ears like a queue tip 
 Too quick for you to refuse it, your defenceless 
 Mental blows that hit you in your dome like clench fist 
 Competition is usually forced to forfeit 
 My celebrity bench presses more than a forklift 
 Don't even step to me on some bullshit 
 Nigga you better off playing Russian Roulette with a full clip 
 I'm knocking niggas out and knocking niggas off 
 For coming around the way with them blods that look like clogs
