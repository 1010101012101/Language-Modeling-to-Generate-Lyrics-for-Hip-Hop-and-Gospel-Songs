(Canibus) 
 Welcome to infinity composition theory 
 All content will be communicated clearly 
 I'll spit a billion bars nearly, don't dare me 
 I'm about to show you why they fear me 
 You see the air in Sumer is ripe with grief and despair 
 I sacrifice trimmings of hair 
 I place 'em on the top of the gold ox, pick up the gold ankh 
 You know I got soul, but where from? 
 The rap juggernaut, Hip Hop dilettante 
 Hip Hop savant, a poor man's Hip Hop God 
 While you rhyme lazy as fuck like you just got your dick sucked 
 I rhyme like I'mma self destruct 
 Metamorphing metaphors, the formula transforms forever more

 Raw to the floor, raw like reservoir dogs -----------Bar War, Bar War, Bar War, Bar War 
 While Rippin Jackers rip bar war ---------------------You don't want none of this at all 
 Either or ---------------------------------------------------It's either or 
 Repeat this mix and upload to Mix War -------------So many god damn bars that's why the call it Bar War 
 War 
 Layer to layer I slay ya
