(Canibus) 
 Yo, Yo 
 Now I said it once, and I'll say it a thousand times 
 I got thousands of rhymes, the rechargeable alkaline kind 
 You want a piece of mind? Fine, we can take it outside 
 Otherwise you're wasting you time, 'cause I'ma shine, for the one triple-nine 
 Niggas gambling, damaged they eyes 
 Going blind, trying to keep up with these lyrical lines 
 The type of nigga you can't flow behind, without a dope rhyme 
 You fuck around and get close-lined till your nosedive 
 We can rhyme fair and square or fair in the sphere 
 Anyplace, anywhere, you niggas don't have a prayer 
 'Cause Doomsday is near, faggot niggas is scared 
 They stand and stare, as I appear upon a cushion of air 
 With a long white beard flaming, hot enough to sunburn Satan 
 Hotter than white people, taking vacations 
 Out in Jamaica, out in the sun-bathing 
 Sun-baking in gamma-ray radiation, till they skin color look Cajun 
 Mother fuckers start aging, to the point where they faces start shrivel up like raisins 
 And they become cancer patients 
 This is 2000 AD, after disaster 
 Flies buzz around a million rappers' cadavers 
 Never been the type to talk 
 My ice-grill's like looking down the wide jaws of a White shark 
 'Bout to rip off your arms like perforated paper 
 A hundred times more sharper than stainless-steel razors 
 Shock you with an electrically-charged taser 
 Till you turn blue in the face and die from asphyxiation 
 The stench of a thousand ounces 
 Grab you by the throat and blow my second-hand weed smoke down it 
 Don't give a fuck what month you dropping in 
 I'll be on the radio hollering, "Fuck you and your cult following" 
 You cum-swallowing transsexual fag 
 With crabs and breasts that sag, dressed in drag 
 Running full-page ads in a porno mag 
 With pictures of you with a dick in your mouth and a dick in your ass 
 I'm probably what you would call a, Record Industry Population Enforcer 
 I slaughter like, 100 rappers each quarter 
 In order to keep my shit in order 
 I track wack MC's from border to border 
 Just like the stories of the hare and the tortoise 
 The rabbit was faster but fell asleep in the forest 
 And lost cause the tortoise had endurance 
 I always stay focused to artists 
 My bonus? I can promise any artist till they just get exhausted and forfeit 
 From actual, supernatural forces, a horsemen from hell 
 Immune to the garlic water and the crosses 
 After my last album I went through a metamorphosis 
 Probably fired more of my people than Doug Morris did 
 Kick the dead beats out, turn around and switch my whole team out 
 Now I got the bangin' ass beats now 
 It paid off 'cause I came off like Aldof 
 And I could murder any, god damn camp I concentrate on 
 With the first strike I'm so nice 
 I could exterminate more suckas then the 3rd Reich 
 The way I burned mics, I've been accused of being all hype 
 All bark and no bite, every night I got into a bar fight
