I was born in Jamaica, reincarnated by the Creator 
 I crawled out of a meteorite crater 
 Bat-shit crazy, I feel like Hip Hop hate me 
 They erased me and my sanity escaped me 
 Sumerian, Israelian, mammalian mixed with alien 
 From the constellation of Aquarius 
 The logo was branded on the back of the savage 
 Who demanded your daughter's hand in marriage for sex magick 
 The light glows on the Agate, rock in the cabin 
 She and I stand before a rabbi in dark fabric 
 The best man is a jealous scumbag maggot 
 He's also her best friend who pretends to be a faggot 
 Next passage: death is a language, I'm Hannibal Lecter 
 Coronate metaphors with my sword and sceptre 
 I was never the best, just corrupted by the weight of success 
 Could've been more productive with less breath 
 I translate codes, animate 1's and 0's 
 To sideways 8 till something great unfolds 
 These are the Psalms unknown, reborn to the bone, 
 It feels wrong, look at these rags I have worn 
 Burn Hollywood Burn, they tried to trick them, 
 I've probably 'Spit a Billion' bars before this one 
 Stars come to life like UFOs moving in the night 
 I memorize the movements of the lights 
 Stingray sharp barbed darts launch from the heart 
 Of the Sephiroth sloth that can make you bleed thoughts 
 So be advised, my rhymes override the mind 
 But you'll be fine after average recovery time 
 I'm heavyweight slim face, I breath when the wind breaks 
 Breast plates move when I give chase 
 Jumped the boundary like Space Jam, wait till I get up in your base camp 
 You gonna have to face the champ 
 Roman shield is composed of a rose coloured stone 
 My sword is honed from Red Dragon's rib bones 
 The bow is quietly cocked, watch, I'm a take the shot 
 If the target ever stands in one spot 
 Tentacles form a loose noose, hang your ass off of the roof 
 Suffocate you till you mourn for a truce 
 Introduce you to my people, stick you with some needles 
 Then place you in a bathtub of carrion beetles 
 Go to sleep people, I'll watch why they feed off your evil 
 And meet you in the motherfucking C-Quel
