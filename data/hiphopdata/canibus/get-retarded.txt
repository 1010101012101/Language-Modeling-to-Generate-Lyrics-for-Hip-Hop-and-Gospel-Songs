(Intro: sample scratched) 
 "I-I-I, want, to.." 
 "G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded" 
 "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded" 
 "Get re-Get re-Get retarded" 
 "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded" 
 "I, want, to.." 
 "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded" 
 (Canibus) 
 Niggas is phoney, fronting like they Masters of Ceremonies 
 None of you suckers are even remotely close to me 
 To be nice, I sacrifice things like no sleep 
 I keep a library of lyrics on microfiche 
 Creating concepts so deep, niggas quote me 
 They rewind then interpret my rhymes to they homies 
 I've advanced beyond your flows, aeons ago 
 It's inevitable in '98 I'ma blow 
 Ever since '84, I've been in it to win it 
 But see back then, we used to battle by spinning on the cement 
 You can't even absorb the rhymes I record 
 Or resolve the deep laws of the physics involved 
 I travel to the end of the universe and beyond 
 Parsecs, out of range from a cellular StarTec 
 From the galaxy of Andromeda 
 I puzzle niggas like Crop Circles and other unexplained phenomena 
 (Chorus: Canibus "sample") 
 Aiyo, nine out of ten of these rap artists is garbage 
 "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded" 
 You spineless, rhymeless, niggas is heartless 
 "Get re-Get re-Get retarded" 
 Aiyo, I came to see that hip-hop is never tarnished 
 "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded" 
 So I {*echoes*} 
 "I, want, to.." 
 "G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded" 
 (Canibus) 
 All I really want is you niggas to stop biting 
 All I really want is you niggas to start writing 
 All I really want is you niggas to be original 
 And start spitting some lyrical shit that I can listen to 
 You haven't written the perfect rhyme yet 
 You don't even know the sequences to the Human Genome Project 
 You haven't come to terms with your God yet 
 And you refuse to believe in Unidentified Flying Objects 
 When I bomb shit, I get retarded, probably more than you bargained 
 I'm talking about ripping a mic off your arm shit 
 Hype shit, blow up a mic shit, you might get 
 Beat the fuck up in broad daylight with a nightstick 
 To the British, I'm Gandhi 
 To the Japanese, I'm an American pilot flying over Nagasaki 
 To the AIDS patient, I'm your last antibody 
 Sitting and waiting for a cure from modern biology 
 (Canibus) 
 I be looking directly into the human eye to see if you pussy 
 And completely ruin your ability to lie to me 
 I pull a 9 on a bully, cock back the cannon 
 Goddamn it, I don't think you fully understand it 
 Ask nine out of ten niggas on the planet 
 Who the best is, the question will go unanswered 
 Till I step up, to the front line with rhymes 
 Revving my engines like they were powered by Le Man's 
 Murdering niggas with lyrics manufactured within my DNA's double-helix 
 I leave you in troubled spirits 
 I'm absolutely the purest breed of emcee 
 From the United States of America to Europe I deserve it 
 However you want to word it, I'm perfect 
 Touch my microphone on accident and get murdered on purpose 
 Motherfucker! 
 "I, want, to.." 
 "G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded" 
 (Outro: sample) 
 "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded" 
 "Get re-Get re-Get retarded" 
 "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded" 
 "G-G-G-G-G-G-Get retarded"
