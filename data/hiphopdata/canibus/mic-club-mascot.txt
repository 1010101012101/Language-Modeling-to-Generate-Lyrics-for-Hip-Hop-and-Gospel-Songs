(Canibus) 
 Yeah, just one of those moments 
 Where a nigga feel like tearin this shit down 
 Y'all niggaz know what Canibus is known for 
 Yeah, yo 
 Propane in the form of flames spray when I point the barrel your way 
 Ever barbecue a piece of meat for a whole day? 
 You'll see a smoke cloud the darkest shade of charcoal gray 
 Even when you get to heaven you'll be D.O.A. 
 Send him to a place GPS couldn't locate 
 My mind so great, my neck might break from the weight 
 Robin Hood of mixtapes since ninety-eight 
 Steal from the fake, give to the real 'cause they feel what I make 
 Stash steel in the field over the hill by the lake 
 Don't make me have to go get it, I peel the grill off your face 
 Jermaine's hell, yeah I package pain for sale, son of Jorel 
 Drinkin' Grand Mariner by the barrel 
 Encourage you to yell, order men to tie you to the top of your cell 
 While I stab you in the navel with a quill 
 Askin you who's ill, tryin' to break your will 
 Spinnin the wheel, lower you down knee first on nails 
 Make you shit yourself, witness the smell 
 Picture an anal IV feedin you poisonous liquidous gel 
 It's violent but why you gettin' all sensitive now 
 I'm the real king of battle, this is how I get down 
 Can't listen to it then DON'T, you spit it fluid then DOPE 
 The illest, comin' from what the other illest quote 
 Magazines once said I was the grateful hope 
 Some washed up bloke that couldn't execute what he wrote 
 It ain't over 'cause I still find ways to promote 
 Waves engulfed my boat but I managed to float 
 Swim to the coast, make a new ark from oak 
 Build a bonfire and smoke, pounds of 'dro 
 My own rhyme scarred my throat, torn is how I'll be remembered by most 
 From now till the day that I croak 
 In a year I'm liable to be on a yacht in the ocean 
 Or in an unmarked plot in a pine box decomposin 
 Mic Club motherfucker...
