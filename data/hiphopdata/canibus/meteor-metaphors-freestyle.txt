(Canibus) 
 Born, raised, corn's what I eat when I graze 
 Served to me on gold trays 
 Sip grape haze, sunny days, ocean waves 
 Always with a bird on those days 
 In the cantina with a canteen of green 
 Yeah, me and my team, they think we from Queens 
 Evisu jeans, white-Nike's with white wings 
 If the recoil springs, the snake-bite stings 
 Bow before what the Great Light brings 
 Lightning makes the sky look stripe-pinned 
 Cranial capacity twenty-five hundred CC 
 You can rap, but you can't see me 
 My emotions echo, I let go into the threshold 
 I grin, my limbs get cold 
 Death to any and all who disrespect Lyrical Law 
 That's the main motor jaw protocol 
 Here's my software: load it all 
 Questions? Any time after 11:34 is good to call 
 The graveyard watch, I still believe in Hip-Hop 
 It's just changed so much that it's not 
 The sane: I ask myself, "Am I still Germaine?" 
 Let's not go through that again 
 The name Can-I-Bus, my music career seems stuck 
 But I'm the only one they can trust 
 Shut up, let me 'bus 
 Rhymes will engulf the Sun; which in turn will engulf us 
 I called because I had to tell you 
 What to do when your resources fail you 
 Banned from the Internet, can't email you 
 I put it in a rhyme, the details'll scare you 
 IQ boosters for iPod computers 
 My job is to preserve yours and my future 
 Special Ops: They fast-rope out of an Osprey 
 I got mustard wings the odd way 
 With God's grace I served Hip-Hop 
 And was not replaced, at least not to my face 
 Now I'm all alone, drinking Patrón 
 From a bowl shaped like Skull and Bones 
 Your man not home, leave a message after the tone 
 No call-back until you massacre a poem 
 I exhale weed smoke, built a dream boat in the placebo 
 With Captain Nemo and three hoes 
 Fine little Fräulein, soon she'll be all mine 
 I'll pour wine to shorten the foreplay time 
 She turn to me slow like, "Honey, where will we go?" 
 I proposed it was best she didn't know 
 Verbal, psychoneural, she said, "I never heard o' you" 
 Your words are purposeful, I might learn a few 
 Special collection service track down every beat purchased 
 Researchers read my incomplete verses 
 The verses were first-string, left-wing 
 Second-wind, then combined created a third thing 
 My heartbeat ends when the Devil and God become friends 
 The Hip-Hop Tribunal will begin 
 Cry for the crisis negotiator, code name: major Omega 
 Crisis situation in the bodega 
 Gun bolt long as a trombone 
 The weapon itself, big as Mutombo 
 Them niggaz was hung practical things like tactical slings 
 LBV retractable springs 
 D-rings pinch my clavicle skin 
 Stay in the underground base, excuse the décor 
 Everybody leave your body armor at the door 
 I drop rhymes like rock-slides 
 The seismic size compromise lives, but not mines 
 I find time to regroup and switch suits 
 While they shoot from a stone-proof booth with no roof 
 My flow is the truth, a Hip-Hop glucose boost 
 And everybody else know it too 
 Step forward, touch the speaker, activate the DNA reader 
 Looks like we got us a tweaker 
 Atomic, ganglionic, chronic, microphone hydroponics 
 With incompetent psycho content 
 The lone inventor, the experimenter 
 Of a scientific splendor that will always be remembered
