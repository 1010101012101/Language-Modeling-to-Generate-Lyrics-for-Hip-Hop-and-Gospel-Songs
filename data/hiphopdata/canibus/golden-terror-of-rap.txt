(Chorus x2: Canibus) 
 I take it back, back to the Golden Era of Rap 
 When it was exactly that 
 Not specifically jams in the park 
 But when emcees used to talk with advanced thought 
 (Canibus) 
 DJ Premier on the boards, 
 Can-I-Bus on the bars with the Lyrical Law 
 Just listen to the rhymes, don't behave cruel to be kind 
 And I'ma show you how I'm nice with mines 
 Forced to start from scratch to rhyme from the heart when I rap: 
 Looking forward to not looking back 
 I spit supernatural, look out for the planet sized shrapnel 
 Rip the Jacker bout to get at you 
 Rippin': Seek and Destroy the motherfucking beat mission 
 The rugged rouge boy rasta on roids tripping 
 Martial arts for the mind: Mandelbrot Hip Hop design 
 You don't understand, STOP TRYING 
 The Hip Hop conglomerate, we legends putting it down 
 You got to honor it: fuck the politics! 
 The B-2 bomb pilot waitn' for that long silince... 
 Then I will diagnose w/ tinnitus: 
 The cuneiform symbols on my uniform tell you what I been through 
 Nigga, I wish it was that simple! 
 The Master Gunnery Combatant blastn' mixtape assassin 
 Cptn. Cold Crush get it crackin'! 
 Heat it up till the bones blacken 
 My microphone double action, I grab it; 
 Switch to automatic! 
 The savage spitting it rapid; I ricochet 7.62 Jacket 
 Full Metal Gold Plaque classics 
 (Canibus) 
 The phonograph fascist, let's see who can reload fastest 
 Your chronograph is still in the past tense 
 Double shot glass of absinthe still spitting fantastic 
 You an absent has been, I'm still rapping 
 A Roman gladiator clashing, chariots crashing 
 Chest plates split in half with axes, blood splashing 
 What you wanna speak about? Let's weed it out 
 Before it turn into something somebody gotta bleed about 
 If I feel the need for speed do not freak out 
 Armour upgrade beneath seat mount, no seat belt 
 Breathe in, breathe out, then lean out 
 White phosphorous smoke screen the whole street out 
 Riot squad gotta reroute, SWAT team can't see now 
 RPG launch out the tree house 
 Got a casualty, tell me what the beef is about 
 He don't wanna talk, let him bleed out, don't need him now 
 PTSD emcee, the kind you read about 
 Turn the beat up Premier, this is how a beast sound
