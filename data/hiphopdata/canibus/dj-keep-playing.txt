 (Canibus) 
 We in the club-scene, a regular hangout spot for unclean 
 Women in tight jeans, who ain't queens 
 Chicken-heads, who should be home, taking care of their eggs 
 Instead, their always in the club, flirting with men 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 Turn your mic on, listen to this intelligent life form 
 Classical, international icons 
 I say rhymes without flaw, display effect without cause 
 People stand, and watch in awe 
 Metaphors leap from jaws, in the form of Dominique Dawes 
 Competing for the platinum, medal award 
 You rocking with the world's finest, rappers 
 Ghetto fabulous, miraculous, so hot we acidic 
 I invite all challengers, take a crack at us 
 And whoever front, will get hit with something disastrous 
 Got to give props to Philly, 'cause that's the state 
 Known for having ill DJ's and cheese steaks
