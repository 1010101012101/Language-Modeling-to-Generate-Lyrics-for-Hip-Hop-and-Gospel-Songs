Pop, the King of New York calls me the King of New Thoughts 
 Serious talk, I'm the imperial spit boss 
 It's going down from the troposphere to the ground 
 Everybody's mouth moving but you can't hear a sound 
 Five round six, direct hit 
 We don't miss, imagine a snake that don't hiss 
 Spit without fork tongue, heavyweight words support drums 
 Nothing but trace of rounds in the gun 
 The odds are a 1000/1 
 Rocket launch a lung Sharpshooter 1, pass the mic to Sun
