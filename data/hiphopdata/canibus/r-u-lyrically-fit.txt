(Canibus) 
 Get ready for the Luminati tsunami 
 (Lou) 
 C4 ??? ???, eat meat raw 
 Street dawgs, rip these off and put C's on 
 Had to ease off from a show I just peed on 
 Bought a two-seater that I put 10G's on 
 Beat her 'cause she took my mother fucking ring off 
 She took me to Supreme Court and the judge got screamed on 
 They sent me up North to a prison with a ??? 
 All day long and lift weights we ping pong 
 Meet King-Kong, Big Don, and Little Shawn 
 Murder One got big arms, he real strong 
 Beat his own mom 'cause she stole from the weed farm 
 Word on the streets, raw, don't beef with Armstrong 
 Wrong season, Lou crush anything he breathes on 
 Pass me the paper and pen and put beats on 
 Rip rap songs put down pads with 
 From ArchivesMusic.com and that's a rap son 
 (Canibus) 
 You mess with my horse, you're dead as a corpse, forget it 
 Rhymes without ending, with infinite lyrics 
 Fools who do get abused like broads 
 In a battle for juice where rhymes are metaphors 
 When my horse appears count your prayers 
 Stab you in the ear then pull out the spear, watch the crowd cheer 
 Leave the floor wet with all the bloodstains 
 So the audience knows that Canibus runs things 
 I ripped down stages on many occasions 
 Dozens of broken down mics and melted tape decks 
 Everywhere I go niggas want to rob me 
 Bootleggers be in the front row trying to get a clear copy 
 So take caution, 'cause I'm a Horseman 
 And I'll snatch that ass up quick like 'turn it off man' 
 So just acknowledge the way that I'm gifted 
 'Cause if rap was a felony I'd be in prison 
 Hogging up the phone, cussing at the C-O's 
 Twenty-five to life with no parole 
 And battling me? You must be feeling yourself 
 I Ripped the Jacker so hard he might kill himself 
 Like his name was Todd or James, back in the dark days 
 It's like a pit-bull getting bit by a Shar-Pei 
 I'll defend my horse, my men, my friends 
 My baby's mama and my offspring so bring it on then 
 So I can show you how I devour 
 Nigga's like a Rottweiler with acidic saliva 
 Step your shit up nigga, the Rip is much iller 
 'Cause when I write rhymes I use the mind to pick the pen up 
 Most artists are garbage, no skills 
 They belong in a landfill 
 Nobody feels them when they grab the mic (Lemmie Hear Sumthin' Else) 
 And start bragging about their massive ice 
 I can't eat emcees 'cause I lost my appetite 
 I'm a beast you're a midget with wack lyrics 
 Like Dr. Evil said, 'Quiet! Shut up! Zip it!' 
 I reign superior, my metaphors are scarier 
 Non-ill rappers, you better evacuate 
 Before I exfoliate your face 
 With abrasive phrases to give your face a face-lift 
 Germaine spit insane shit so stop hating if you can't applaud me 
 And give rap music the glory
