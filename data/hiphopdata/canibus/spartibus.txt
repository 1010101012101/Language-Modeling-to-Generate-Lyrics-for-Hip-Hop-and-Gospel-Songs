 Yeah 
 This is Spartibus 
 (Canibus) 
 You want to spar with 'Bus? Then let's get started 'cause 
 Atomic thrust turn you into cosmic dust 
 Bomb your borders with Japanese spigot mortars 
 Recompose your composition to sawdust 
 Time is breath, breath is life, life is light 
 Light is no less than capital 'C' on the mic 
 Beneath the mirage of night, I'll attack you twice 
 Prepare the river sacrifice for my ritual rites 
 Reinforce my habitual likes and dislikes 
 To diss you on the mic 'cause I'm sick of the hype 
 No one's ever written what I write, compare the calligraphy type 
 Tell me yo, how can I not be nice 
 The royal semen of Caesar frozen in a cryo-freezer 
 On sale for seven figures per millimetre 
 Lethally illegal, I speak to the people 
 In the form of an eagle on top of the Thebes Cathedral 
 With boundless knowledge, like hairless Dalai Lamas 
 With linen garments neatly wrapped around armpits 
 With monasteries in the mountains 
 Trumpets have already sounded, you can't denounce my crown, bitch 
 (Canibus) 
 The game is Chinese chess 
 Countless issues need to be addressed before the East nukes the West 
 Totalitarianistic cause and effect 
 Run the words through a decompressor, recompress the depth 
 Canibus is the most explosive next to meth 
 The inconsistency of the text makes me complex 
 Pay attention to 'Bis, my intention is this 
 Leave you spatially adrift, suspended in the abyss 
 Marijuana plant owners smell my aroma 
 Contract sycosis sarcoma and retinoblastoma 
 Confederate federal General Lee electric general 
 FCC omni-directional antenna poles 
 IFF, identification, friend or foe 
 This area's restricted, don't let him through 
 He'll mock your style 
 Rock you to the ground with the bite force of a Sarcosuchus crocodile 
 Travel a fiber optic mile before you can smile 
 So don't ask me why and don't ask how 
 (Canibus) 
 Till I'm impressed with the print, I can hear a pin drop like Sprint 
 Once it blends I can stop right then 
 Quantum coupling mechanisms and technical shit 
 Confuses you, but I don't think you're any less if it did 
 Just define what is poetry and what is rap 
 I'll demonstrate how to effectively bridge the gap 
 The answer is simple in fact 
 If the protons don't attack the retina, all we'd ever see is black 
 No ability, no extra-ocular motility 
 Silly emcees can't see me lyrically or visually 
 They'll never be better than me 
 I'll triple team them with the Trinity severed in three and give them nine enemies 
 Climb back to periscope depth in two hours, Surrender and throw in the towel 
 The amalgam of the ultimate album, this is Spartibus power 
 *Rakim samples from Paid in Full's "My Melody" 
 Any MC that disagree with me just wave your arm (4x) 
 Now tear it up y'all, and bless the mic for the gods
