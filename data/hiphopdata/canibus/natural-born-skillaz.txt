Yeah 
 I'm a Natural Born Skilla 
 Thirstin Howl the Third and Bis spit hard 
 Naturally Born to rip these bars 
 Yo, Vic low can I bust the bars? 
 You a monster with the lyrical law 
 You my nigga for life, this ain't just a song 
 The Bronx bomber was born with body armour on 
 I'm a Natural Born Skilla (x5) 
 We Natural Born Spitters 
 I'm a Natural Born Skilla, guerilla killer 
 The microphone ripper, my bones bigger then Trilathon stone pillars 
 I flow real as Captain Cold Crush give you the shivers 
 'Cause I'm the illest that administers lyrics 
 Elixirs from an alchemist chemistry fission 
 Dark brown like Guinness, a dark wizard in a yoga position 
 Bringing some muscle flash lyrics 
 In spite of my dark visions in a dark room used for developing pictures 
 Spit a sentence to silence the Heavens 
 Exchange knowledge for dollars endeavours 
 College credit students acknowledge my message 
 In the presence of Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina 
 Marijuana godfather, bare fisted armed robber 
 Run up in the beauty parlour, speaking to gallah 
 Where is the reefer, bitch I'm Phillipino 
 Feets is rocking Adidas 
 She told me she never seen it, I was heated 
 Put her mouth to my penis, like bitch see this, I'll make you clean it 
 Dirty dick nigga in a dark basement 
 Screaming on Tigga like nigga I'm the Rap City ripper 
 The big ripper six shot, snub spitter nigga 
 I'ma get you motherfucker, I'm a Natural Born Skilla 
 Spitta, Skilla, Spitta, Skilla (repeats till fade)
