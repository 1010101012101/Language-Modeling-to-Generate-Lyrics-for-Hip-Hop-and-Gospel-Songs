[Intro: Canibus] 
 Approximately fifty years ago 
 under the direction of President Harry Truman 
 and in the interest of national security 
 A group of twelve top military scientific personnel were established 
 This group's primary objective 
 was to desensitize us to the truth 
 And to suppress the material evidence that our planet is being visited 
 by a group of extraterrestrial biological entities called the grays 
 [Chorus] 
 Tune in to channel zero (8X) 
 [Canibus] 
 Yo, sometimes the road to the truth is so elusive it's confusing 
 And reality becomes illusion 
 If I showed the masses where we was at or where we was going 
 I'd shatter the social balance of the world as we know it 
 I'm talking 'bout the grand deception of 1947 
 When our souls were sold to the heavens 
 for technologically advanced weapons 
 Crystal enhanced brain implants and mind control methods 
 MJ-12 is not majestic 
 And the focal point of our problems on this planet are not domestic 
 You can accept it or be stupid and be a sceptic 
 and fail to recognize the secret society's deathwish 
 Ninety-seven percent of our Presidents were Masons 
 Responsible for laundering trillions of dollars from the nation 
 for the construction of underground military installations 
 Abductions and cattle mutilations 
 Experiments on human patients 
 can take place in several subterranean bases 
 A hundred and fifty stories below a basement 
 With knowledge of genetic information, you need to fear science not Satan 
 Cause through the manipulation of certain biological agents 
 They create strange creations, top secret special operations 
 Low frequency sounds and lasers, people like Carl Sagan 
 that didn't believe in the Drake equation 
 were trying to keep Western civilization on the need-to-know basis 
 Well you need to know that this is a game 
 and we're being betrayed and played in the worst way 
 [Chorus x8] 
 Tune in to channel zero 
 [Canibus] 
 Yo, the holy script from Genesis 1-26 
 says, "Let us make man in our image under our likeness" 
 First of all who's THEY? 
 You see if God was truly a single entity that's not what he would say 
 We as the Elohim, gods and goddesses 
 possess a marvellously monstrous subconscious 
 Lifeforms that speak, in very high pitched sounds and squeaks 
 Short staccato clicks and beeps 
 A highly advanced form of speech 
 Even though to us it seems like they only chattering their teeth 
 They used to swim deep in the oceans beneath 
 'Til they fins transformed into limbs and they started to creep 
 Then they evolved into mammals with feet 
 And walked right from the shorelines onto the beach 
 They used gravity, cause it's actually the only force around 
 that could slow time and the speed of light down 
 The energy grid network, opened the gateway from Earth 
 to any point in the universe 
 Living organisms and various, 
 geomagnetic gravitational, anomaly areas 
 Space expedition teams in the lunar regions 
 reported seeing, giza pyramids and tetrahedrons 
 Liquid filled shoes, is what they used 
 to walk across the moon without leaving a clue 
 of where they been for the past twenty-three billion years 
 Before life on the surface even appeared 
 I hope you become aware what I'm spitting in your ear 
 was intended to stimulate your left-brain's hemisphere 
 I know it sounds weird, all these motherfucking answers 
 of questions to the Grand Deception 
 [Chorus x 16] 
 Tune in to channel zero
