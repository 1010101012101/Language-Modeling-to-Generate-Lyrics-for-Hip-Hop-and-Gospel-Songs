We can perceive anything 
 'Cause there is a time and space for everything 
 I'm under twenty-four hour restraint 
 I meditate for twenty-three hours and fifty-nine minutes, then take a break 
 My body is ground based 
 My soul is probably in outer space 
 Go hard in the paint till I faint 
 I tell 'em what it is, they think about what it ain't 
 The reality they create would not let them escape 
 The average hip-hop head got Avatar legs 
 The intellect spreads, now they see what I said 
 Ras, raise your right hand 
 Grab the mic off the mic stand, memorize rhymes like a hype-man 
 There's no light on the cam, darkness falls over the land 
 Frozen in trance, chosen by chance 
 The rebel that blast metal, three hundred sixty degree swivel 
 Three eighty sacramental, special 
 Backpack a mental metal 
 The singularity sentinel sent through the Stargate bezel 
 Made a crystal to tell you 
 Something simple, and try to prepare you 
 They restrain you because they fear you 
 Be careful, or turn into a werewolf, I dare you 
 They restrain you because they fear you
