(Chorus - s51) 
 The message from the masters, act fast before disaster 
 The frequency is shifting, nothing else even matters 
 Planet earth is the school, ascension is the lesson 
 Accept the love, drop the weapons in less than five seconds 
 The message from the masters, act fast before disaster 
 The frequency is shifting, nothing else even matters 
 Planet earth is the school, ascension is the lesson 
 Accept the love, drop the weapons in less than five seconds 
 (s51) 
 Above the skies of America no matter whatever the weather be 
 Multiple mixed messages begin a new dawn in history 
 I volunteered myself to merge with spirits during celestial visits 
 Discover new physics through my beautiful lyrics 
 Experimenting with the latent powers of the human mind 
 Designed to evolve the populace who were falling far behind 
 The alien nation surrounded the galactic space-station 
 Clairvoyantly channeling the answer to the great equation 
 The code cracking team discovered a world like no other 
 From the perspective of the planets we are all sisters and brothers 
 The galaxy is crawling with beings, intelligent life swimming in streams 
 The leaders lie, they say its nothing more than a dream 
 I am still the great oracle I can see into the future 
 Four & a half foot beings being interviewed by oprah 
 Dramatic advances given to mankinds survival chances 
 The populace finally figured out that loves the missing answer 
 The message from the masters, act fast before disaster 
 The frequency is shifting, nothing else even matters 
 Planet earth is the school, ascension is the lesson 
 Accept the love, drop the weapons in less than five seconds 
 The message from the masters, act fast before disaster 
 The frequency is shifting, nothing else even matters 
 Planet earth is the school, ascension is the lesson 
 Accept the love, drop the weapons in less than five seconds 
 (Xprenn) 
 The solar system is charging, where will you go? 
 Space/time or time/space? you should know it's your choice 
 For yourself and others, do not keep your eyes closed 
 Love's the missing link, know to listen to its voice 
 You sit there and listen to the beat and the lyrics 
 Let them resonate with you to awaken your spirit 
 Set goals in your life that you deeply desire 
 Go for the prize, keep fueling the fire 
 The agenda of mother gaia, a free mind investing in prayer 
 The layers of reality infallibly shifting everywhere 
 The cycles of time proceed to take this effect much further 
 Listen to the bars, so that your light may burgeon 
 Poetry, energy, sanctity, willingly, responsibility, humanity, wizardry, identity, 
 Possibilities, reality, ability, spiritually, gravity, density, mentally, creativity, galaxy, infinity! 
 The message from the masters, act fast before disaster 
 The frequency is shifting, nothing else even matters 
 Planet earth is the school, ascension is the lesson 
 Accept the love, drop the weapons in less than five seconds 
 The message from the masters, act fast before disaster 
 The frequency is shifting, nothing else even matters 
 Planet earth is the school, ascension is the lesson 
 Accept the love, drop the weapons in less than five seconds 
 (s51) 
 Particles of a soul, fragments of a whole, we are perfect 
 My sole purpose on this planet is my souls purpose 
 Looking into the near future the dollar has become rendered useless 
 Basic energy has moved, my mind becomes a computer 
 (Xprenn) 
 In a cave below ground, at the top of the temple mount 
 We're all bound around the sounds of profound underground 
 Yeah! beyond the matrix, the prototype was basic 
 The future will reboot ya, consciousness? raise it! 
 (s51) 
 Settled and integrated, after we graduated 
 Modern life originated inside of the grey spaceship 
 St germain on a galactic mission, sharing galactic visions 
 Spit insane, take a listen, free people from their mental prison. 
 (Xprenn) 
 In a newly ordered world of higher density 
 The earth magnified by increased energy 
 Manifest reality, do it perpetually 
 With an applied mind outside time, who's ready? 
 The message from the masters, act fast before disaster 
 The frequency is shifting, nothing else even matters 
 Planet earth is the school, ascension is the lesson 
 Accept the love, drop the weapons in less than five seconds 
 The message from the masters, act fast before disaster 
 The frequency is shifting, nothing else even matters 
 Planet earth is the school, ascension is the lesson 
 Accept the love, drop the weapons in less than five seconds
