A-Yo, I be the indestructible thug 
 The type to draw first blood wit eight-ounce gloves 
 If you want it, you can get it, so if you can't disarm it don't set it 
 The bomb'll blow if you tamper wit' it 
 I'm analytic, so run for cover when I kick it 
 Lyrics that fly like bullets when the hammer hit it 
 While you niggaz is babblin, my lyrics is travellin' 
 Like a javelin, to stab you in the abdomen 
 Acronyms and nouns, predicates and adjectives, you can't fuck wit the Canibus 
 You'll catch damages beyond repair 
 My rhymes smash through the booth window to strike the engineer 
 I can maintain a threshold for pain 
 And walk across the sun barefoot lookin' for shade 
 I re-arrange your ribcage like a twelve-gauge at close range 
 And change the position of your brain 
 Hard raps penetrate through your hard-hats and all that, kid 
 Get 'ya wigs peeled back 
 I'll scalp you like the Indians on horseback 
 Running bull will hit you harder than running back 
 Stunning man with brave and cunning raps 
 Swiftly running laps around forty-eight tracks 
 Like uncut crack, fiends keep coming back 
 Heads is flipping like acrobats on gym mats 
 From wax to analogue tapes to digital dat 
 It's critical black, the Canibus is ill like that
