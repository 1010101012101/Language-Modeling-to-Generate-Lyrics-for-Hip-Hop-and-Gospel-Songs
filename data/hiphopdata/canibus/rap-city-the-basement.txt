Yo I bust it, the blood in my brain super conducted 
 A supreme intelligent being you don't wanna scuff with 
 Cassette tapes encassed in a chemical substance 
 That'll cause it to explode if you try to dub it 
 Tight rhymes, sent speed? rockin' with nother lifetime 
 Keep Erica all to myself, 'cause I like dimes 
 Radiation from the bright shine, metling MC's with hype lines 
 I'm very selfish with my mic time 
 When I recite mines, my rhymes explode like a pipe bomb 
 Nobody in they right, -OR-, they left mind could test my 
 Power to weight ratio, makes it capable for me 
 To carry 1000lb BOS radios 
 Messin with the CANI, is like steppin on a live land mine 
 Behind enemy lines 
 Military paratroops in camouflage parachutes 
 With flight suits and boots landing on ya roof 
 Eliminate the target is the prime objective 
 I create psychic walls harder then cemeters 
 Nobody enters, Nobody exits 
 I wreck this with methods, electric like the Pentagons fences 
 MC's with the hype-nitis disease, is like crack thieves 
 With the Hepatitis B vaccine 
 Navy seal team making chicks scream 
 Make him suffer dipped in vaginal cream 
 Cause you wack suckas ain't worth the earth that you walk on 
 You ain't worth the paper plates prisoners eat pork on 
 The devolution I bring is a diagrammatic enigma 
 I'm on that, ain't the stimula' 
 Tigga pass my diadem 
 You prolly thinkin' this Incubus 'cause I'm an inimical epiphany 
 This is an epistolary symphony 
 Seriously, the Canibus illuminates with logic 
 What I speak its more than deep is bibulous 
 With common sense I'm organized like prime? in mafias 
 Plus the way I rhyme is Prime like Optimus 
 A rapologist sittin' through the knowledge 
 Went through GED's to degrees of IVY League colleges 
 A politic with any magazine columnist 
 About topics other MC's wont even bother with 
 Rock solid shit like stones in monuments 
 Its obvious the third eye of the obelisk is watchin us closely 
 Through a microscope and a pair of binoculars 
 Ghetto scholars like me who study street calculus 
 Utilize every letter of the Arabic alphabet 
 And touch every part of your body that makes you feel erogenous 
 Like that chya'll
