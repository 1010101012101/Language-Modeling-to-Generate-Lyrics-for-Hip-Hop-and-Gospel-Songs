Aiyo, Mother Earth absorbs the blood I bleed 
 Hip Hop is my blood, I believe 
 That I am not free and neither are you 
 The only time I feel free is when I'm rhyming in the booth 
 The lion on the loose is not a reckless recluse 
 But really a dictator with his neck in a noose 
 For war crimes, hardcore rhymes from a warped mind 
 That enjoyed the dark matter in the void before time 
 The innocent murmured it, murdered because they worshiped him 
 They let the serpent in but it never occurred to them 
 The deity regards emcees like me piously 
 Check the degree, see if it's me 
 On planet Earth I designed mankind's rebirth 
 Amalgam of water and rock salt from a verse 
 The moon, the sun and the stars 
 I am who you are, together we all form God 
 I laugh at the creation of it, the explanation of it 
 Not the original but man's imitation of it 
 They took Hip Hop and changed the subject 
 Then I brought Hip Hop back and made you love it 
 Through deterrence, detention and prevention 
 Never write the wrong sentence, if I ever said it I meant it 
 The insatiable, inescapable regiment 
 What's the weight? Add four more plates, I bench it 
 Skinny-ass nigga, grab your neck with a pen-grip 
 Bend it through telepathic suggestion 
 I rap so serious, the vocal myriad 
 Occurs intermittently over protracted periods 
 Rap 'til you get delirious, wack niggas get furious 
 Keep dissing me, your girl's getting curious 
 Darth Vader on the cross-fader releasing the raw data 
 This is called hard jawbreaker labor 
 When I see you I'ma battle you, then tackle you 
 Then grapple you, then probably snap you in two 
 Yo, ain't that the truth, outside the booth 
 Air combat manoeuvres without no computer 
 Space wings that cause spings motherfucker 
 We gonna dogfight above cloud cover 
 High in the friendly skies, where unfriendlies lie 
 Where friendlies and unfriendlies die 
 You and I race to the sun, I just got back, the race is done 
 Ages have ended and ages have begun 
 Cognitive saturation, I am the one 
 Tell me where Chaingun Germaine came from 
 A Dara-i-Suf, the river of caves 
 My ribcage look like miniature shin blades 
 When I bathe in the waters below 
 Still waters run deep, King Cthulhu told me so 
 Magma-dome under Yellowstone inside the bowels of the Earth 
 I'ma show you the power of the verse 
 'Cause man cannot establish dominance over man indefinitely 
 Man only respects God's energy 
 Telluric energy, drawn from the bowels of the Earth 
 I'ma show you the power of the verse 
 Telluric energy, drawn from the bowels of the Earth 
 I'ma show you the power of the verse
