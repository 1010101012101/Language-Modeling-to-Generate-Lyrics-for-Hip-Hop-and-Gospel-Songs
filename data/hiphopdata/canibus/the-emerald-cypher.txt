(Canibus) 
 You ain't a behavioural scientist, why you dying to spit? 
 You try too hard when you rhyming with Bis, try again 
 Approve this for public release, fuck with the beast 
 With bucked teeth bust your guns or get rushed in the streets 
 Handcuffed to the back of the jeep, blindfolded 
 You hear a foreign language they speak, you do not know it 
 Kidnapped to Kimet through Khartoum to parched sand dunes 
 To a dark room to witness your doom 
 Bash you in the face with the mag 
 Rope around your neck over a tree branch, hoist you up with three sandbags 
 You shit yourself, your pants sag 
 Global broadcast, man that's sad, they lynched him in the lab 
 Twenty four apprentices for hardcore fellowship 
 Twenty four masters, twenty four lyricists 
 Dead to the world, alive to the hearts that are pure 
 If you endure your mind's open doors 
 Complete the last step without crossing my rep 
 Who's next? What possessed you to jump off a cliff? 
 I spit darts, once you stop the Hip Hop Juggernaut 
 Kill you bloodclot, you stink like jungle rot 
 Me I'm a Hermann Bushido Dogan Shotokan, the prototype of the first proto rhyme 
 With combined payloads my glide bombs provide flows 
 That cause World War II death tolls at live shows 
 Independently targeted 
 Bombing shit from so high up in the atmosphere you lose consciousness 
 No oxygen, only Canibus anti-oxidants 
 Think about it, why spit into a bottomless pit? 
 I'm so isolated lyrically, they put me in a desert facility 
 To test my abilities, check out my melodies 
 Designed by Pratt and Whitney, rap so swiftly 
 TAW-50 following me 'cause you're with me 
 Your high bars are lukewarm, let me school y'all 
 Intravenously cold blooded cooling coils are running through my jaws 
 The Sun's hot, I'm warmer, the metaphor explorer 
 I give a order: You can't cross the border! 
 We ain't religions, don't talk about the Torah 
 We crucify you on a cross for a quarter 
 Welcome to my House of Slaughter, signing on the roster 
 Go downstairs, put your stuff in the locker 
 And come back, let me see what you got, son 
 I dropped him, rappers stepping to me, I ain't the one 
 Spontaneous nucleonic you the opposite, be honest 
 You produce reduced knowledge, your discography is dishonest 
 Both promise, change your name to MC Silence 
 Yes, your album inspired me. No, I didn't by it 
 Talk back, nigga get fired 
 I'll erase your verse off the track so fast you'll wake up tired 
 Candles go out, darkness infiltrate the house 
 What the fuck he talking about? He got a mental case mouth 
 I forced him to his knees, told him to face south 
 Empty your PayPal bank account before I blow your brains out 
 Untouchable since the day I came out 
 That's why these wack niggas keep calling my name out 
 How the fuck they gonna change that now? 
 How they sound? I'ma put him in the ground, Lyrical Law style 
 How you liked at me then, how you like me now 
 How you like me in the future when I'm wearing that crown 
 The crown is invisible, you don't have to be a loud individual 
 You act like Hip Hop is all you listen to 
 If that's true, this is for you 
 Then I'ma keep ripping you, 'cause that's what Canibus do 
 If that's true, this is for you 
 And I'ma keep ripping you, 'cause that's what Canibus do
