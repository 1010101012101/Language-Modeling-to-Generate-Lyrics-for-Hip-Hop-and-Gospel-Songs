 How many emcees must get dissed 
 Before somebody says, 'don't fuck with 'Bis'? 
 How many emcees? 
 Don't fuck with 'Bis 
 (Canibus) 
 Yo 
 I'm valued as one of America's most prestigious breeds of rapper 
 With oral speeches and ghetto English 
 Canibus, Can-I-Bus is my L.L.C. 
 Limited Liability Corp; can you spell that for me? 
 When I was young, I wish I had someone to tell that to me 
 Here's my card, Poet Laureate, since eighteen, oh, three 
 I know people who have written newspapers on me 
 Some are grateful to me, others be hating on me 
 You want to bet I ain't the illest? What you trading with G? 
 Occasionally, I can feel the ripper raging in me 
 I don't know, maybe it could be how the industry behaved with me 
 And let's say, probably the Jamaican in me 
 It could also be Universal wasn't patient with me 
 If they weren't paying me, I could have called it slavery 
 The way they blatantly labeled me 
 Some satanically motivated rapper that was related to beef 
 I know I'm strange, but my blood ain't green 
 And I never needed a team because I'm not as dumb as I seem 
 The trinity divided into a dozen light beams 
 The future I've seen has humbled my dreams 
 To come in famine and disease 
 But let me chill I sound like Priest, and I don't really feel like getting deep 
 Y'all niggas know anyone of The Horsemen could rip shit 
 But how many emcees must get dissed? 
 (Canibus) 
 How many emcees must get dissed 
 Before somebody says, 'don't fuck with 'Bis'? 
 How many emcees? 
 Don't fuck with 'Bis 
 How many emcees must get dissed 
 Before somebody says, 'don't fuck with 'Bis'? 
 How many emcees? 
 Don't fuck with 'Bis 
 (Canibus) 
 You know, I think it's just time to be grateful 
 For every emcee that came through and spit tapeful's of data for you 
 Every album before this, I made it for you 
 Nowadays the truth is I got nothing to prove 
 But I heard him call my name a couple times 
 In a couple of his rhymes and I thought about it a couple of times 
 Is he looking for a response or is he being a jerk? 
 Or am I just too involved in my work? 
 I thought to myself, 'why he put my name in his verse?' 
 When he said I wasn't ill, he just made things worse 
 That's when I recognized what Stan was worth 
 The only man on Darth that could reverse the Cool J curse 
 I served him, like a nigga without purpose 
 Constantly taken Rip the Jacker back to my therapist 
 I wasn't prepared for this 
 People want to embarrass 'Bis for reasons that are not really apparent to me yet 
 What, I can't get signed because I got mad at a vet? 
 How could a couple verses have so much anger in them? 
 Don't you know the difference between Rip the Jacker and 'Bis? 
 Go use the Pythagoras theory and do the math on this 
 Add up every multi syllable paragraph 
 That I've managed to average since January ninety-six 
 And tell me when you find it you dick riding bitch 
 I'm so sick of you been skeptical, always running behind my shit 
 Tell me the truth, you really think its time that I quit? 
 You think maybe I could wholesale these rhymes that I spit? 
 I guess the nicest MC's got tired of 'Bis 
 And lied to themselves like they never relied on 'Bis 
 The real rock of the game, people have climbed on 'Bis 
 Rhyme more sick than anybody out your clique 
 With thousands of niggas to vouch for that shit 
 I got a couple of bitches too, I make them bow to the dick 
 The album is sick, some Hollywood biography shit 
 The difference between ships in bottles, and bottles in ships 
 Fucking with Rip, they find your fossils at the bottoms of cliffs 
 Stick six mics up your ass, even though I doubt it will fit 
 But still how many emcees must get dissed 
 Before somebody says don't fuck with 'Bis? 
 (Canibus) 
 How many emcees must get dissed 
 Before somebody says, 'don't fuck with 'Bis'? 
 How many emcees? 
 Don't fuck with 'Bis 
 How many emcees must get dissed 
 Before somebody says, 'don't fuck with 'Bis'? 
 How many emcees? 
 Don't fuck with 'Bis 
 I'll battle you on the net, I'll battle you in the flesh 
 Y'all niggas know the rest 
 Don't fuck with 'Bis 
 How many emcees must get dissed 
 Before somebody says, 'don't fuck with 'Bis'? 
 Don't fuck with 'Bis 
 How many emcees must get dissed 
 Before somebody says, 'don't fuck with 'Bis'? 
 I'll battle you on the net, I'll battle you in the flesh 
 Y'all niggas know the rest 
 Don't fuck with 'Bis
