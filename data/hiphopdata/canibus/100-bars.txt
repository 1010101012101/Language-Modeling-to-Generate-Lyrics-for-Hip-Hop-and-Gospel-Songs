Yeah! That's the beat right there. 
 I'm about to black out with 100 bars on some professional shit. 
 So don't try this at home, yo. 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 My style of rhyming, is ancient like Aztec's and Mayan's 
 Because I recognize it's all about timing 
 Me and my freestyle alliance, practicing African Voodoo science 
 In front of twenty foot bonfires 
 Looking skyward, calculating May fifth, two thousand 
 The nine planets'll be in alignment 
 The arrival of the prophet, in the cockpit 
 Of a star ship the size of the Hale-Bopp comet 
 With mercury ion rockets 
 And a big ass, 'Canibus coming soon' poster on the side of it 
 I'm known geographically, and intergalactically 
 That's why I got extraterrestrials that want to battle me 
 They even tried kidnapping me 
 And they would've snatched me, if their craft didn't get trapped in the Earth's gravity 
 Engines stalled and failed, crashed into a farmer's field 
 And that's really what caused Roswell 
 Undercover operatives working for COM twelve 
 Disguised as a nigga signed with a record deal 
 Lyrically, I'm off-scale 
 So all hail, or get tossed towards Hell, whatever y'all feel 
 Bruising niggas, confusing niggas, like Chip Fu from the Fu-Schnickens 
 Hit you with nuclear cruiser missiles 
 Hear the wild wolf growl 
 Styles, stockpiled for miles, from the ground to the clouds 
 Wack niggas wanna be down, but it's not allowed 
 Interrupt the cipher unannounced and you'll get punched in the mouth 
 With the Southpaw Southern fist 
 I'll bust your shit, swell your lip bigger than bubba shrimp 
 For acting tough as shit, what a wimp 
 You giant Goliath niggas get shot with a rubber sling 
 I'm an experiment gone bad 
 My brainwaves on an encephalograph show that I'm stark raving mad 
 Your whole scientific staff'll get killed in a nuclear blast 
 When I throw the Florence flask in my hand 
 Flammable liquids in the lab explode and you get stabbed with all the flying glass 
 Trained to blow up commercial aircraft 
 Trained in chemical weapons class, just to see how long a nigga's breath'll last 
 I put him in a leather mask, spray his ass 
 With a can of pepper gas, then watch him grab his neck and gag 
 Watch the nigga choke to death as I laugh 
 'You wanna battle?' is the type of question you should never ask 
 Nigga, pick a tougher task, see who the fuck'll last 
 Whoever lose'll get a soldering iron up the ass 
 You need to recognize, my hand is quicker than the eye 
 Quicker than the five speed Jamiroquai drives 
 A lifespan longer than nine lives, infinite rhymes that can't die 
 A nigga with a divine mind 
 I dedicate this to the wise, dedicate it to dimes 
 Dividing myself into a hundred ten times 
 You can't deny the offering's an offer 
 Flows that glow with aurora's that spark of light 
 Water fly like a saucer, with the torque of a Porsche 
 Murder a million emcees, then autograph all of their coffins 
 Been getting it on, since I been born, and I'ma live long 
 And I'ma be getting it on till I'm gone 
 Look at all the stages I've been on, all the songs that I've spit on 
 I took an oath to rip everything I get on 
 A nigga like me should have carpal tunnel syndrome 
 In the wrist bones from gripping microphones this long 
 I'm just a small fish in a big pond 
 That gets pissed off whenever I get picked on 
 Nigga try to flip and get flipped on 
 My army march a million strong like the Nation of Islam, with Suede Timbs on 
 Extremely hostile, fully armed troops, dressed in frog-suits 
 And night vision goggles 
 A lyrical lynch mob, shitting on niggas drawn to a hideous form 
 With horns, and a mink on 
 Ducking down low like Vietnam, fighting the Vietcong 
 Screaming, 'incoming' when I see a bomb 
 Speak to your leader, surrender your arms 
 You need about a million more soldiers to even the odds 
 Plus eight hundred thousand to even consider a war 
 And two hundred thousand more to even look hard 
 You better drop your flag and withdraw 
 My cavalry charge, accompanied by a blizzard of wicked metaphors 
 And smash y'all, attach y'all to the back of my horse 
 And drag y'all across the motherfucking asphalt 
 Nine out of ten niggas is frauds 
 You know who you are, always talking about your bitches and your cars 
 Your jewellery and your girls, it's like we from two different worlds 
 You mother fuckers really get on my nerves 
 'Cause I'm beyond them, on some futuristic cyborg shit 
 I close my eyes when I freestyle so I could read what prints across them 
 Then raise my arms like a sorcerer and cast a fireball into the audience 
 To barbecue your brain organs, you feel like you've been thrown in a microwave oven 
 I flame broil suckers 
 And hit 'em with some more shit, the raw shit 
 Call my reinforcements, the four horsemen 
 Take a big piece of chalk and, draw a line across the stage pulpit 
 I dare a mother fucker to cross it 
 I'll even call my man Black Rob at two in the morning 
 Tell him it's important, tell him to call Sting three-way, and sing a chorus 
 Break your camcorders so you motherfuckers can't record it 
 Call the news, I'll kill your reporters, start a lawsuit, I'll kill your lawyers 
 Fuck the soft shit and fuck what y'all think 
 My album's gold, 'cause my album was the bomb, shit 
 Y'all niggas got your ass beat 'cause you asked for it 
 Got your picture taken and put in a tabloid 
 'Cause you a man and you like to touch little boys 
 You fuck 'em in the ass, then you give 'em cash for it 
 That's some sick shit homeboy 
 A hundred years ago, they'd have took you to see Sigmund Freud 
 You fraudulent, feminine, fragile as a feather is 
 With an effortless blow, I'll crack your whole skeleton 
 You think you're better than Canibus, where's the evidence? 
 You got below average intelligence and poor penmanship 
 You need to shut the fuck up 'cause your breath stinks 
 Take fifty cents and purchase a pack of peppermints 
 Battling me, you'll never win 
 You thought you was the only nigga that could sneak a weapon in? Nigga guess again 
 'Cause after I'm finished wrecking this shit 
 I'ma drink a whole bottle of Henney, and go fuck a lesbian
