(Canibus) 
 They lying through they teeth, they lying over they beats 
 They got beef but they don't got no trigger time in the street 
 Gilly suit gangster, ginger root strangler 
 Walk around all angry looking for some answers 
 This is what future rap gon' sound like 
 Lyrically we generate electricity on the mic 
 Listen to his rap flow, he battles his shadow 
 Rap slow, bravo, no wonder he brag though 
 The best lyricist ever, who you gonna ask for? 
 Personal pen game so precise, supernatural 
 Just some nobodies barely nobody knows 
 About a thousand years old with a potty mouth flow 
 When it comes to rhymes, everything you see 
 Mine, every time the Mixing Board comes alive 
 When it comes to rhymes, everything you see 
 Mine, every time the Mixing Board comes alive
