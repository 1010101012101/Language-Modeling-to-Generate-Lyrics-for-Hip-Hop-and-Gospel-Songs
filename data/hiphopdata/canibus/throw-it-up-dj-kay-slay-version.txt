(Canibus) 
 Calling all dogs, calling all dogs 
 Be on the look out for a big homo nigga with dimples 
 And I'ma let y'all know something, it ain't just start here 
 We've been preying on that ass since, 'Jack the Ripper' 
 And now its time to Rip the Jacker 
 (Canibus) 
 No rapper could rap quite like I can 
 You know who the fuck I am, I'm the Canibus man 
 I had to rock to a beat like this, to show you 
 That I'm iller than the future, the present, and the old you 
 I told you, wish you could take it all back don't you? 
 Tried to smoke some cannabis, but Canibus smoked you 
 Calling yourself the greatest is something you don't do 
 'Cause after I humiliate you, what will the G.O.A.T. do 
 You can't rap, or act my main man 
 You going to end up as an intern, working for Def Jam 
 See you was never bad enough to battle with Canibus 
 You out of luck, I crushed you the minute I got tatted up 
 And every lie you told just added up, 'cause you wasn't man enough 
 To be fair, but I'm mad a fuck and I've had enough 
 Jack the ripper I'ma rip the jacker 
 Rape a rapper, with a classic from his own masters 
 You're dead 
 (Canibus) 
 There's a rumor going around that I got dropped 
 Two hundred thousand albums sold at ten dollars a pop 
 Three hundred thousand albums were shipped, you do the math 
 That's three million in three months, so kiss my ass 
 All these magazines tried to steamroll me to death 
 But guess what? the G.O.A.T. ain't platinum and neither is 'Clef 
 And I'm still here, despite of all that shit them niggas said 
 The skinny kid, the music industry's guinea pig 
 Tighter then ever, world's chief mic wrecker 
 Tougher then reverend run's mutha fucking leather 
 I'm hardcore, cum shot right in your wife's face 
 You soft porn, you held hands on the first date 
 See when you was making records like 'I need love' 
 Your homie Cornell was giving it to you up the butt 
 Plus I heard Simone was the high school slut 
 And she learned how to fuck before she knew how to cuss 
 Nigga your dead 
 (Canibus) 
 You married a slut, and had kids with her to cover up your hustle 
 You and your man Russell made a better couple 
 Your probably mad as fuck, wondering where I got the information from 
 Your being watched even when you take a dump 
 Its impossible to front, you can't hide 
 The chairs at your label got ears and the walls got eyes 
 You live in one big lie, the world just don't know 
 You take a polygraph test, that shit would probably explode 
 The truth is Mr. Smith you got a fucked up attitude 
 God knows that I pity your fans for backing you 
 Yo, this be the realest shit I ever wrote 
 You should change your mutha fucking name from G.O.A.T. to G.L.O.A.T. 
 The Greatest Liar Of All Time that cannot rhyme 
 That cannot shine as long as I'm alive 
 Your prime ended eight months before ninety-nine 
 And that microphone on your arm will always be mine 
 Nigga your dead 
 (Canibus) 
 I told you to leave it alone, but you was too stubborn 
 Now you're in a world where the hunter becomes the hunted 
 Your wife is scared 'cause she don't want to lose a husband 
 And somebody keeps paging you putting four, three, two, one in 
 You can't sleep at night thinking about the drama 
 Shit stains all up in your Phat Farm pyjamas 
 Even FUBU gear looks hot, until it touches you 
 Probably because your Father Undoubtedly Butt-fucked U 
 Mama said knock who out? I'll punch that bitch in the mouth 
 'Cause she don't know what she talking about 
 Ay yo, do me a favor when you see your ghostwriters 
 Tell them the rhymes they wrote for you should have been a lot tighter 
 You could have asked me, I'll write you some lines 
 I'll do anything for the Greatest Loser Of All Time 
 You still dripping with wack juice, 'cause you wack nigga 
 If you want the last word you can have it, I'm still iller 
 You're dead
