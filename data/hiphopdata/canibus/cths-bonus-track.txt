I speak in frequencies dogs would have trouble hearin 
 Canibus is the lyrical version of German engineerin 
 Raw metaphors keep you high for months 
 Fly around the Earth twice without re-fuelling once 
 Ain't too many categories I can fit in when it come to spitting 
 'Cause I'm overqualified for the position 
 The lazer guided lyrical hybrid 
 Creatin' scripts so sick, I gotta arm wrestle my pen to write it 
 Don't get excited 'cause if I ever catch one of you wanna-be's biting 
 We're gonna be fist fighting 
 So motherfuckers what you want? 
 I got the shotgun pumped 
 You feel like a frog nigga, then jump 
 I posses the lyrical ammo to battle 
 And rip any one of you warm blooded mammals to shambles 
 I make examples of you and eat a mouth full of your crew 
 The typa emcee you can't out-do 
 I'll battle you on the net, I'll battle you in the flesh 
 I'll battle you over the phone you can call me collect 
 I'll battle you over a blank check, I'll battle you wit a gun to my neck 
 I'll battle you standing over the toilet wit my dick out 
 I'll battle you juggling a hand grenade with the pin out 
 In a stolen car wit the fin number ripped out 
 Drinking a Guinness Stout doing a 360 spinout
