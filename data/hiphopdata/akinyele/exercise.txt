* Heavy breathing * 
 Check this out man 
 All this gym shit 
 Runnin' around for a scholarship 
 Ain't even my style man 
 I don't even know what the fuck I'm doin' in this shit 
 Bout to get the FUCK up out of this shit 
 Ain't even with this 
 (Akinyele) 
 Me play sports? Don't place your bet 
 I'm not the type of guy to run up and down and break out in a sweat 
 I just make the words sound hip 
 I leave it up to Jane Fonda, to take care of that physical fit shit 
 Nothin' wrong with bein overWEIGHT, everything STRAIGHT 
 So long as my pockets stay in SHAPE 
 I never participated in gym 
 I hated the thought, to even have to take a loss to begin 
 They say health brings you longevity 
 But I'm not one for that extra-curriculum activity 
 You might see the Ak, with a baseball hat 
 Won't see me on no field with no baseball bat 
 In case some nigga head, got to get cracked 
 Other than that, I don't plan to run track 
 Picture me joggin for miles... HAH! 
 Come on kid, that's just not my style 
 I just talk to girls on the horn 
 You won't see the Ak upstairs, puttin' no butter on his corns 
 Another athlete bites the dust 
 Another nigga from Egypt, make Egyptian Musk 
 Picture me wearin Pro Keds, runnin' the full court 
 Don't jump out your basket-ass head 
 I just cool around the block and hold down the fort 
 Straight up and down nigga, I'm not a good sport
