I think this might be paradise 
 I just hope it last forever 
 I think this might be wonderland 
 I just hope it last forever 
 Ricky Rozay 
 Yeah, yes 
 (Maybach Music) 
 Get you out to France, fly you out to Nice 
 Or we can chill out in Atlanta, let's enjoy the feast 
 We can do the spa, we can do the mall 
 I bet it do the job, she wish she with the Boss 
 Livin' like the movies, which she work for 
 I got the fitty in the crib, that's on the first floor 
 Belaire with the lemons what she thirst for 
 Digging for your soul, your spirit's what I search for 
 Rich and a guest, ain't nothing above this (Maybach Music) 
 Tongue-kissing with sex, we fell in love quick 
 Red leather double R, I'm on some Don shit 
 Black bottle boy and all white bosses 
 I think this might be paradise 
 I just hope it last forever 
 I think this might be wonderland 
 I just hope it last forever 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Looking around at the collision of ambition and vision 
 I'm really starting to believe that I dream for a living 
 I couldn't play it safe, that's too way risky for me 
 Instead I'm walking out on shows with like two-fifty on me 
 I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to hustle on it 
 Too busy looking for success, it's how I stumbled on it 
 Russ got the potion, fuck just hoping 
 Luck tends to bet on the ones in motion 
 Wrote one check to take care of my parents' debt, tell the IRS 
 Six figures doesn't make me sweat, I'm flying on jets 
 G4 for four of us, real spacious 
 Bought my family cars and I buy them all places 
 Apartment complexes that I own, low-key shit 
 Getting paid from rooms where haters senting tweets 
 Seamless, becoming what I meant to be 
 God just keep on blessing me in front of my enemies 
 I think this might be paradise 
 I just hope it last forever 
 I think this might be wonderland 
 I just hope it last forever 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Nothing last forever unless you talking 'bout my rap game 
 I can do it to you like this or like that man 
 No pressure on me, I'm the freshest homie 
 Walk by faith, to see me is to know me 
 We undeniably, reliably, what rise they come 
 The prodical son and I am the one 
 Insurmountable funds, that's for my daughter and son 
 I remember getting nickels, dimes, fours, and ones 
 See I ain't looking back no more, I'm in paradise 
 Eating steaks and shrimp like a pimp and that's err'night 
 Stepping out the shower, to a mean flow 
 I'm in the heels, getting money, I got pink toe 
 Max my stacks just like Rico, penthouse suite like Tinico 
 I open my blinds to get a view 
 Now tell nigga what it really do? 
 I think this might be paradise 
 I just hope it last forever 
 I think this might be wonderland 
 I just hope it last forever
