(Yeah, everybody got a breakin' point) 
 Yeah, na na na na 
 I move with peace and Igbos 
 For any rappers tryna play the hero 
 For any peasant tryna play Debo on some tough guy shit 
 I'm not a tough guy, bitch 
 You mad 'cause the girl you wanna fuck sucked my dick 
 You were a high school loser, now a bitter adult 
 I handle your karma myself, that's a quicker result 
 Raisin' money to kill me 'cause y'all be poppin' the pills 
 Take the money, save the money for your hospital bills, bitch 
 They think it's sweet because my skin tone 
 Little bitch, I been known 
 People that extend beyond my zipcode 
 Copie role Old National highway 
 Spelled it out for out-of-towners comin' at me sideways 
 Old Nat 
 I can't want for them to get you 
 Y'all stalkers studied up on me, can't wait for them to test you 
 Old Nat 
 I'm unassumin' so you're unprepared 
 I might make them film it, show the world you're fuckin' scared 
 They want me to shut the fuck up, fuck that 
 They want my talent, my nuts tucked, fuck that 
 They're tryna get me to hate me, fuck that 
 'Cause y'all can't ever ever play me, fuck that 
 Stop playin' with me, playin' with me 
 Somebody gon' end up hurt 
 Stop playin' with me, playin' with me 
 I promise I see every word 
 Yeah, I got big and your bitch is the proof 
 I got bigger when the media twisted the truth 
 These insecure grown men that I've never met 
 Y'all don't have a cause 
 If people like me don't exist, y'all don't have a job 
 You a bitch, you probably got fucked in the pen 
 You still a bitch, you just got stuck with a pen 
 Fuck the clickbait, political bitch-made journalists 
 Y'all like pussies, smell like fishbait 
 I dictate my hours, how 'bout you? 
 I made four million in four minutes bitch, how 'bout you? 
 Like a Final Four moment that I'll never forget 
 I wore a fuckin' T-shirt and then I cut through the neck 
 I win 
 We'll never meet, you're not rich enough bitch 
 All your disses don't reach, you're not big enough bitch 
 Y'all be dissin' for the clout, that's how poppin' I am 
 One phone call, this phone is like a Glock in my hand 
 They want me to shut the fuck up, fuck that 
 They want my talent, my nuts tucked, fuck that 
 They're tryna get me to hate me, fuck that 
 'Cause y'all can't ever ever play me, fuck that 
 Stop playin' with me, playin' with me 
 Somebody gon' end up hurt 
 Stop playin' with me, playin' with me 
 I promise I see every word 
 Yeah 
 This whole nation is so shaken by the approach taken 
 My soul is exposed naked, 'm blatant, I'm so brazen 
 That's why I'm the most hated, runnin' on low patience 
 I'm road pavin', screamin' truth until my throat's achin' 
 No chasin', after shows hoes waitin' 
 Y'all careers keep failin', study mine, start note takin' 
 Carvin' my name in the game in both (?) 
 Nowadays, a hundred thousand dollars feels like no payment 
 So jaded, real gold, I used to wear gold-plated 
 That's when I was located and my come-up broke phase 
 I'm on a new chapter, turnin' back to those pages 
 It's hard bein' so famous, I can't be in both places 
 Judgin' both stages 
 The most that I can do is show traces 
 All I ask for in return is just go where the growth takes us 
 I propose a toast to those who don't condone fake shit 
 Game is full of squares, I'm just here to reshape it 
 Mixin' up my message, stop trying to rephrase it 
 Listen to the truth, stop trying to translate it 
 This is coming from a winner, trust me when I say it 
 You'll never be a main act if you can't maintain it 
 And to the people threatenin', makin' bold statements 
 I got people that love the sounds of fists flyin' and bones breakin' 
 Your green room's just a box, they gon' catch you, no fakin' 
 They're the kings of fuckin' people up in small and close spaces 
 Stop playin' with me, playin' with me 
 Somebody gon' end up hurt 
 Stop playin' with me, playin' with me 
 I promise I see every word 
 They want me to shut the fuck up, fuck that 
 They want my talent, my nuts tucked, fuck that 
 They're tryna get me to hate me, fuck that 
 'Cause y'all can't ever ever play me, fuck that
