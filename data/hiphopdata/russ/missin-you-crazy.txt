Yeah, I been thinking a lot 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, hey 
 Come on 
 It's been way too long since I 
 Seen you, looked you in your eyes 
 Riding round the town and staying, I don't wanna say goodbye 
 Everything's so different now 
 You're just what I'm missing now 
 But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm tripping now 
 Sometimes I start missing you crazy 
 Ain't nothing quite like you 
 Love like this keeps going and going 
 I cannot forget you 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Ride around town in a hoopty (uh) 
 Way before I ever had a groupie (uh) 
 Back when I used to wear the same five shirts 
 Way before I ever had Gucci (uh) 
 Way before I ever had a Rollie on 
 Talking back when I drive (?) 
 Picking up an eighth that my homie got 
 Fucking in the car that's the only spot 
 Back when I felt more free 
 Back when I smoked more weed 
 Back when I drove up and down 92 with a view of the moon and you in my passenger seat 
 That was so good 
 Now it's all gone 
 It is what it is 'cause we both moved on 
 At least we 
 Have memories 
 And we also got this song 
 It's been way too long since I 
 Seen you, looked you in your eyes 
 Riding round the town and staying, I don't wanna say goodbye 
 Everything's so different now 
 You're just what I'm missing now 
 But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm tripping now 
 Sometimes I start missing you crazy 
 Ain't nothing quite like you 
 Love like this keeps going and going 
 I cannot forget you 
 Yeah 
 If you saw me now 
 Would you recognize me or would you call me out 
 I know it's been a while but I'm still me 
 But honestly it's been so long that I wouldn't be offended if you didn't even feel me 
 There's a gap now 
 Drinking enough to make us forget how we felt in the past now 
 Everything moving so fast now (now) 
 I miss things going slower 
 I miss us being closer 
 I mean I got a good thing but I feel like I don't even really know her 
 This a new life 
 I didn't do you right 
 But I got a second chance to prove my appreciation 
 I should take it 
 I'm sorry that I ever got jaded 
 It's been way too long since I 
 Seen you, looked you in your eyes 
 Riding round the town and staying, I don't wanna say goodbye 
 Everything's so different now 
 You're just what I'm missing now 
 But I know that I can't have you back, I guess I'm tripping now 
 Sometimes I start missing you crazy 
 Ain't nothing quite like you 
 Love like this keeps going and going 
 I cannot forget you
