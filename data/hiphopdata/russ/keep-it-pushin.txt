You ain't gotta wait up, I ain't 'boutta save ya 
 I'ma just be honest, I won't see you later 
 I'ma keep it pushin', you should keep it pushin' 
 We both know what's up, aye 
 You ain't gotta wait up, I ain't 'boutta save ya 
 I'ma just be honest, I won't see you later 
 I'ma keep it pushin', you should keep it pushin' 
 We both know what's up, aye 
 We were too young, not ready 
 I was why I-I love heavy 
 You, we think that this ain't real 
 You, maybe get compassionate until 
 I think I get it, you really love me 
 I learn my lesson, now I can trust me 
 Looking back, yeah it was a mess 
 At least you cared, got shit off your chest 
 Guess I'm stuck, go back home 
 Ready baby but she think she grown 
 Blowing up my phone like "where the fuck are you at?" 
 "Girl I'm in the studio, I thought you knew that" 
 Doesn't matter that we living in the same city 
 I promise I'm not lying when I say I'm not busy 
 You ain't ready for the lifestyle I'm living 
 Twenty-five and settle down is not in my vision 
 Going at the same, our lifes so different 
 Yeah 
 I think we should call it quits 
 I ain't got the time for the back-and-forth arguments 
 Unnecessary drama, gotta cut that 
 Anything but that, energy on fuck that 
 Ball shit, you either get it or you don't 
 If you don't, I ain't got the time to tell you why you don't 
 Ever get it, you better end it 
 Yeah 
 You ain't gotta wait up, I ain't 'boutta save ya 
 I'ma just be honest, I won't see you later 
 I'ma keep it pushin', you should keep it pushin' 
 We both know what's up, aye 
 You ain't gotta wait up, I ain't 'boutta save ya 
 I'ma just be honest, I won't see you later 
 I'ma keep it pushin', you should keep it pushin' 
 We both know what's up, aye 
 Okay, I think I get it 
 I think I finally understand what you been saying 
 You can't stay, now just admit it 
 For the longest time, you ain't be with it 
 Is it something I did? 
 Is it something I said? 
 'Cause I felt like I gave you more than I had to give 
 Oh I tried, I tried and tried a little 
 I cried, I cried, I still cry a little 
 You say we both know what's up but 
 I don't know what's up with you 
 I don't know what I could do, I could do 
 You say we both know the deal but 
 I am scared that after this, I won't feel 
 Just so you know 
 All of this time you had me on Cloud 9 
 Hm, just so you know 
 All through our lows, you made me feel high, yeah 
 You ain't gotta wait up, I ain't 'boutta save ya 
 I'ma just be honest, I won't see you later 
 I'ma keep it pushin', you should keep it pushin' 
 We both know what's up, aye 
 You ain't gotta wait up, I ain't 'boutta save ya 
 I'ma just be honest, I won't see you later 
 I'ma keep it pushin', you should keep it pushin' 
 We both know what's up, aye
