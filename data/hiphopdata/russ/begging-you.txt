(Yeah 
 I'm beggin' you) 
 Take all my pain away 
 Take all my pain away 
 Take all my pain away 
 Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you 
 Take all my pain away 
 Take all my pain away 
 Take all my pain away 
 Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you 
 Time goes on 
 I hope I stay strong 
 Don't you stop right now 
 You can't stop right now 
 Time goes on 
 I hope I stay strong 
 Don't you stop right now 
 You can't stop right now 
 Yeah, yeah 
 I can't take it anymore, I need a break 
 Fake lookin' slim, and my doubts gaining weight 
 Had all meds, doctor says he's bipolar 
 I'm scared I'ma turn out like that when I'm older 
 Haven't been in love since I was droppin' mixtapes 
 Build up a wall, swear it's tall, like 6'8 
 I don't wanna spend my twenties on the road 
 To spend my thirties wondering why I'm alone 
 I'ma buy a 40, take it straight to the head 
 Fifty thousand dollars could get all my haters dead 
 I won't even feel it and they won't even trace it 
 Devil sees my blessings, swear to God he's tryna take it 
 Guess I gotta pray that I will not engage that 
 'Nother sleepless night, dark circles on my face 
 Middle finger aimed at anywhere the pain's at 
 RIP Popop, wish that I could change that, yeah 
 Take all my pain away 
 Take all my pain away 
 Take all my pain away 
 Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you 
 Take all my pain away 
 Take all my pain away 
 Take all my pain away 
 Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you 
 Time goes on 
 I hope I stay strong 
 Don't you stop right now 
 You can't stop right now 
 Time goes on 
 I hope I stay strong 
 Don't you stop right now 
 You can't stop right now 
 Had a face full of stuff like Shia LaBeouf 
 Tryna find some love, dipped off in the cut 
 I don't wanna talk right now 
 Even though I need to talk right now 
 But I'm hidin', I'm lonesome 
 I can't seem to shake this off 
 This suit is a nuisance 
 I'm steady tryna break these walls 
 Yeah 
 I'm steady takin' care of my family, I'm sending wires like texts 
 I got a lot of mouths to feel, I'm 'bout to hire a chef 
 It's all on me, I gotta get the bag like Mike Conley 
 Hope the money's always on time like Ashanti 
 On me, present, gotta be everywhere 
 For my family, for my friends, for my fans 
 It's not fair to myself, but it is what it is 
 I'm runnin' low on self-care, but it is what it is (fuck it) 
 Take all my pain away 
 Take all my pain away 
 Take all my pain away 
 Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you 
 Take all my pain away 
 Take all my pain away 
 Take all my pain away 
 Don't give it back, I'm beggin' you 
 Time goes on 
 I hope I stay strong 
 Don't you stop right now 
 You can't stop right now 
 Time goes on 
 I hope I stay strong 
 Don't you stop right now 
 You can't stop right now
