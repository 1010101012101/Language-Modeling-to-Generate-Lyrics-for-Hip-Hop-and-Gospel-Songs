We've been knowin' about each other for a while now 
 Ain't no past we could have taken for this lifestyle 
 I had a girl, you had a man but that was long ago 
 Fallin' daily please don't judge me, it was long ago 
 I know you ain't gonna wait forever 
 I know that it's gonna take more effort 
 You ain't gotta tell me what I gotta do to prove it to you, I know 
 Baby take me serious 
 Baby take me serious 
 Baby take me serious (mm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm) 
 Baby take me serious 
 Baby take me serious 
 Baby take me serious (mm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm) 
 ATL, you're on call 
 I just toured, I just balled 
 I got time now, girl I'm ready 
 You so fed up 
 You won't test me 
 You say I say that I'm busy 
 Way too much but you still miss me 
 I still fuck you, you still kiss me 
 That all you resent me for 
 Baby take me serious 
 Baby take me serious 
 Baby take me serious (mm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm) 
 Baby take me serious 
 Baby take me serious 
 Baby take me serious (mm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm) 
 Yuh, I been thirsty since before your water broke 
 I been thirsty since before Tha Carter IV 
 You teach Spanish and you look nice in the coat 
 Life is falling into place, but not in love 
 I'm still tryna see you even though I fucked already 
 I ain't kick you out even after I bust already 
 You think that I'll choose another woman over you 
 Fuck talkin', I'ma show you 
 Baby take me serious (fuck talkin', fuck talkin') 
 Baby take me serious 
 Baby take me serious (mm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm) 
 Baby take me serious 
 Baby take me serious 
 Baby take me serious (mm-hmm, mm-hmm, hmm) 
 (Fuck talkin', fuck talkin', fuck talkin', fuck talkin') 
 (Fuck talkin', fuck talkin', fuck talkin', fuck talkin')
