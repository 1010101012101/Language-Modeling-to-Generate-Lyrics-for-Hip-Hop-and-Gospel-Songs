Yeah, maybe this just not our time 
 You got your life, I got mine 
 You're too far away, let's be real 
 To get too attached, let's be real 
 Baby on the other hand 
 We be kicking it 
 Can't find nothing wrong with you 
 You stay up with me 
 Help me with a song or two 
 Your momma loves me and I think my momma loves you too 
 I love you dearly 
 I love it when you near me 
 I love how you don't care how I make weekly what they make yearly 
 Yes, I love your accent 
 I love your compassion 
 Let's just sing it sweetly 
 And on the flip side 
 Barely sent an invite 
 But that's all it took you on a plane I'm on your insides 
 Fuckin' to my homies 
 I can't be the only 
 This can't be her first time 
 Yeah, maybe this just not our time 
 You got your life, I got mine 
 You're too far away, let's be real 
 To get too attached, let's be real 
 Baby on the other hand 
 We be kicking it 
 Can't find nothing wrong with you 
 You stay up with me 
 Help me with a song or two 
 Your momma loves me and I think my momma loves you too 
 Yeah 
 I can't tell, do I miss you enough to drink? 
 Or did I drink enough to miss you? 
 So in love I'm scared to blink 
 God forbid I miss a moment with you we share in the bed 
 Takin' leaps of faith of love together, we sharin' on the ledge 
 And around that time my trust issues be kicking in (kicking in) 
 I swear Latina and trouble is just a synonym 
 Despite chemistry it's so hard to overlook how we met 
 Miami hotel girl, it's hard to forget 
 Maybe this just not our time 
 You got your life, I got mine 
 You're too far away, let's be real 
 To get too attached, let's be real 
 Baby on the other hand 
 We be kicking it 
 Can't find nothing wrong with you 
 You stay up with me 
 Help me with a song or two 
 Your momma loves me and I think my momma loves you too
