Yeah... 
 Yeah, just copped a mansion and my parents a crib 
 Listening to doubt never worked for me but my arrogance did 
 They love to hate, they love to hate 
 How ironic, I know 
 She loves my long hair and my tattoos 
 How iconic, I know 
 Women pounce often and my sound poppin' 
 Y'all are clout hoppin', while I'm house shoppin' 
 You should make more moves and less announcements 
 I'm having sex with spouses 
 Watch me invest in counters, I got the best accountants 
 I'm looking at the aftermath upon my hours 
 Unfortunately, I barely take the time to smell my flowers 
 Used to move around a lot 
 Used to have to pack couches 
 Now I'm on the road playing shows for packed houses 
 Now I'm in Toronto smoking maple leaves 
 I got the catalog of branches outside of the label street 
 You can't label me, I made all my shots 
 But that was when the crowd was ghost 
 Now the world is watching me 
 Time to go repeat results 
 I'm the outlaw 
 I do my thing and talk my shit and run my mouth off 
 I never really ever gave a fuck about y'all 
 Got a lot of hits left like a southpaw 
 Without y'all 
 I been in the Dominican swimmin' in thick women with skin like cinnamon bitches 'til Tuesday 
 Don't you ever talk to me crazy, you still got roommates 
 Went platinum out a suitcase, y'all too fake, y'all debut came and went 
 And I'm throwing the (?) 
 Ta-da, bitch I'm here, y'all pop up and disappear 
 I bump Bianca in Bahamas, I want 20 mill this year 
 What y'all know 'bout doin' sold out shows around the globe, I bring the hoes out 
 The come-up's documented, you should scroll down 
 And peep game 
 You can say he changed 
 'Cause he went in a (?), but he landed where he aimed 
 So, bump the chest you thumpin' 
 Fuck the threats you published 
 I'm up in yo city and doing shows, address is public (ah!) 
 Never listen to the churches 
 I listen to Kanye, Eminem, Nipsey, J. Cole, Kendrick, Drake and Jay-Z verses 
 Rappers the new sermon, rappers are the preachers 
 Rappers are the doctors and the teachers, the world leaders 
 C'mon! 
 I'm the outlaw 
 I do my thing and talk my shit and run my mouth off 
 I never really ever gave a fuck about y'all 
 Got a lot of hits left like a southpaw 
 Without y'all 
 People say I'm cocky, people say I'm arrogant 
 I think lack of confidence is very un-American 
 Miss me with comparisons 
 Y'all can't hold a candle to me, you gon' need more paraffin 
 Bunch of fuckin' zombies poppin' pills and sippin' heroin 
 Y'all are so embarrassin' 
 Got your wifey runnin' all her fingers through my hair again 
 Starin' in her soul, your bitch has no control 
 She's lookin' at my platinum plaques, your bitch ass still in gold 
 Hot globally, you hot locally 
 I'm noticing this game hasn't really noticed me 
 It's okay, I understand 
 I wasn't in your plan 
 They all gon' come around 'cause I'm the motherfuckin' man 
 I was right about what, I was wrong about when 
 I'm livin' right right now, 'cause I was right back then 
 I was right about what, I was wrong about when 
 I'm livin' right right now, 'cause I was right back then, bitch 
 I'm the outlaw 
 I do my thing and talk my shit and run my mouth off 
 I never really ever gave a fuck about y'all 
 Got a lot of hits left like a southpaw 
 Without y'all 
 I'm the outlaw 
 I do my thing and talk my shit and run my mouth off 
 I never really ever gave a fuck about y'all 
 Got a lot of hits left like a southpaw 
 Without y'all
