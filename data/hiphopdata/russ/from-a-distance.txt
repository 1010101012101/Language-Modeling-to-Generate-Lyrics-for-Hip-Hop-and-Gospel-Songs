I've been out of state 
 You been stuck in yours 
 It's not personal 
 You call me than I ignore you then 
 I'm just tryna detach (detach) 
 I rarely ever get time to relax 
 When I do I'm tryna rejuvenate, meditate 
 But I fuck with you from a distance, (yeah) 
 I fuck with you from a distance, (yeah) 
 I fuck with you from a distance e 
 You want me to free time 
 To talk you but I 
 Only talk to you when I got free time 
 I guess that's the difference between this and mrs 
 You looking for someone who has time 
 But I fuck with you from a distance (yeah) 
 I fuck with you from a distance (yeah) 
 I fuck with you from a distance 
 Yeah, she don't really care about the fame or the dolla's 
 She be bad as fuck in some hoodie and some joggers 
 I be on the road ignoring all the facetimes 
 Not tryna break calls, but I'm on my break time 
 I just did tours non-stop 
 Had girls on all fours and on top 
 I had sisters, I had cousins, doing freak shit 
 Not I'm tryna chill, smoke weed, make music 
 I know I promised, but sometimes shit pops up when you poppin' 
 I know we text a lot 
 When I see you, best believe we havin' sex a lot 
 Connect the dots 
 If we tryna draw conclusions 
 Love is feeling like it's all an illusion 
 Still young let me go through my phases 
 Let me adjust, girl I just got famous 
 But I fuck with you from a distance (yeah) 
 I fuck with you from a distance (yeah) 
 I fuck with you from a distance
