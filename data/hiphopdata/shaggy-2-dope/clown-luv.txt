This song is called clown luv from shaggy 2 dope's first album fuck off. 
 Here they are; 
 Gansta's bangin', 
 Nutz straight hangin', 
 Chillin' in the alley way, 
 Signs straight beemin', 
 Up in the air round' here they don't care, 
 Get your mutha fuckin' melon busted for a stare, 
 Love pumpin' through the heart flowin' through the veins, 
 Pop a mutha fucka like it ain't no thang, 
 Blood shot eyes from puffin' on the blunt, 
 Let me see that rag, 
 Let me see that love, 
 (Rollin' through the hood, 
 Top cut down, 
 Car packed so full it was workin' on the ground, 
 Maxed with the homies, spittin' on the hoe's, 
 Stop at the store for a cold 4-0) 
 Grabbin' on your balls, 
 Straight slingin' stones, 
 Fuck the gang squad tryna' take me out my home, 
 Check my neck, 
 And I got yours, 
 Cause' roll with yourself, 
 And keep that clown luv, 
 Throw you signs in the air,(hey!) 
 What's that I don't check I don't care,(ho!) 
 Cause' I'm down with the clown everywhere,(hey!) 
 And much clown luv is in here..(biitch!) 
 (Ay' holmes what's that you claimin'?) 
 I'm in the rymin' game, 
 Wickid clown bangin', 
 I'm justa a mutha fucka that's down for the cause, 
 You can suck on my balls, 
 Unless you got clown luv, 
 Put em' up, 
 Throw em' up, 
 Let me see them mutha fuckas, 
 Flip em' up, 
 Flip em' down, 
 Flip em' around mutha fuckas, 
 Mind don't walk, 
 From breatin' on the smog, 
 I'm all up in this shit, 
 Like if my name was frog, 
 (Damn I heard a shot, 
 But I got luck, 
 The mutha fuckas missed now its time to shoot em' up, 
 Here comes the siren, 
 I hear em' gettin' close, 
 Here come the squad, 
 Its time to get ghost,) 
 If you wanna stay you get beat by a pig, 
 Fuck that shit cause' where I live, 
 My boys got my neck, 
 And I got theirs, 
 Cause' I'm true to my set biitch! 
 Clown luv, 
 Throw you signs in the air,(hey!) 
 What's that I don't check I don't care,(ho!) 
 Cause' I'm down with the clown everywhere,(hey!) 
 Cause' much clown luv is in here..(biitch!) 
 Hey, 
 What the fuck you lookin' at man? 
 My rag, my flannel, or the club in my hand, 
 Well here go ahead, 
 Take a closer look... 
 (Bang) eh! (bang) ooh! 
 Thanks for the wallet bitch! 
 Give me them duckets, 
 Mutha fuckin' child, 
 To busy doin' other things like hangin' with my mob, 
 Crew got my neck, 
 When push come to shove, 
 Never sell out your set! 
 And keep that clown luv! 
 (Chorus) (2x) (plays till end and fades) 
 Throw you signs in the air,(hey!) 
 What's that I don't check I don't care,(ho!) 
 Cause' I'm down with the clown everywhere,(hey!) 
 And much clown luv is in here..(biitch!)...
