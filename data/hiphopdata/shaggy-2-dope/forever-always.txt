I'm neva gonna die 'cause I belong alive 
 I'm the muntha fuckin' proof only the strong survive 
 I've never been in Folcom I never changed to apease 
 Never gonna car crash or catch a lame disease 
 You'll always see me on a trycicle big as a car 
 Tricked out with three fat bithces on the handle bars 
 A mutha fuckin' clown pimp, never passin away 
 And I'll ALWAYS be your homie from way back in the day 
 Death can't have this 'cause I'm quicker than bullets, 
 Red necks try to hide from me sniffin they mullets 
 But I can spot them out fast pack a hurt until it bottoms out 
 Never take a ride in one myself that's what I'm talkin' about 
 Nope, never leavin' I'll never stop breathin 
 I'll always be a heathin never leave my momma grieven 
 I'll never get old, never get week forever more 
 I run the under ground from here to equidore 
 Neva gonna die 
 (X4) 
 I'm forever and ever and ever, Forever always 
 I'll never fade to black, never replay the shit I say 
 You can't find me box me or burry me away 
 I'm on the south west side son runnin' down Casper 
 Bein chased by some thugs in a car I run faster 
 I'm never gonna die 'cause I'm part of somethin' bigger 
 Never gonna flat line, never need no grave digger 
 This the real whicked shit from Detroit, the running man 
 When the summer streets heat up and the murdas come again 
 I'm never gonna die slow, I'm never goin' quick 
 Never leave the world as long as fat chicks blowin' dick 
 I'll never die broke or ritch, I'll never die at all, 
 I'll be here the mutha fuckin' sky falls 
 Let the floor collaps I'll forever drop with it 
 I'll never lose signal never stop transmittin 
 I will never die put that on "All that I got" 
 Forever chokin that sripper tie it all in a knot 
 I will neva die 
 (X8) 
 I'm forever and ever and ever, Forever always 
 1974, 1983, 1995, 2007, 2017, 2032, 2055, 2088, 3012, 3049 
 Never be history, I'll always be the future 
 Swan divin off the renisance without a parachute 
 You gotta see me smack the floor see me bounce back for more 
 See me parasalein through the biggest hurricane you ever saw 
 I'm never gonna die, put that on a commet in the sky 
 When it smaches in the Earth I jumpin' on to catch a ride 
 Every year I'll still be here but from another stratusphere 
 I'll neva die and though I hope you fuckers know now that is clear 
 I'm neva gonna die 
 (X8) 
 I'm forever and ever and ever, forever always
