Twiztid! 
 Shaggs 2 dope! 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 (Shaggy 2 dope) 
 Don't blink ya eyes even for a second 
 You might miss out on the freaks that only come out at night 
 And don't you doubt 
 When your up past ya bedtime and hear that creek in yo closet 
 That it might be us by the moon we hunt, bitch you betta watch it 
 We dwell in the underground but are seen on the surface 
 Can't phathom what we do your only option is to fear us 
 When ur feet start to rumble go ahead and take a look down 
 Then you'll know we shot so hard to the depths we make the dirt glow 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 You fuck wit us we'll fuck you up! 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 They try to see us but they can't! 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 You fuck wit us we'll fuck you up! 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 They try to see us but they can't! 
 (Monoxide child) 
 Let me put one threw your fitted cap 
 And hopefully that'll take care of everything from your silly beats to shitty raps 
 Gimme a crack at ya lime light, one time right 
 And you'll see that I'm a diamond that just started to shine bright 
 Intimidatin ain't that old to us, the pain and anguish 
 From our teachers to our parents thet all said I wouldn't make it 
 And ya hate is just another way to show how much we made it 
 A to z we fuckin' school it and it's there, it's how you grade it 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 You fuck wit us we'll fuck you up! 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 They try to see us but they can't! 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 You fuck wit us we'll fuck you up! 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 They try to see us but they can't!

 Twiztid and shaggy 2 dope, commin straight for your throat 
 Like iron mike shark applyin the choke hold in the vocal booth 
 We appear outta thin air 
 Like phatoms in cemeteries and wollow wit out a care 
 We the wrong ones, you don't want none at all 
 Speakin' sour on the hatchet bring the drama to your jaw 
 Speakin' foul on the people that's p s y 
 Southwest and eastside combined now who ride, on them bitch ass 
 (Monoxide child) 
 Gang related, hated by most, fuck how you feel, pick another host 
 Fuck, while I'm here let me see all the folks 
 Who really feel like I'm an underground joke 
 Nobody wanna really be silly but silly got somethin' on his mind 
 On the dime I can throw it in rewind 
 Drop a dime and them pop the trunk 
 No grill wit chips in the front 
 Not drank wit ice in the cup 
 No way I'm gunna be wit a slut wit a gut from drinkin' too much nut 
 Don't act like you don't know, 'cause I just filled you in 
 It's the last time I'ma say it so fuck it let them killas in 
 (Shaggy 2 dope) 
 We elusive, and that's the only way we do shit 
 One minute we here next minute we gone, then we on some new shit 
 Get ya blessins countin', you don't know me like you thought you did 
 I'll make yo neck a fountine think nothin' of it like I thought I should 
 (Jamie madrox) 
 Why they fuckin' wit us when they wanted to be us 
 Hangin' on the style and swingin' on these fuckin' nuts 
 It's a family business and I'm a representative 
 With an axe and a suit and a will to be competitive 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 You fuck wit us we'll fuck you up! 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 They try to see us but they can't! 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 You fuck wit us we'll fuck you up! 
 Why you always fuckin' wit us? 
 They try to see us but they can't!
