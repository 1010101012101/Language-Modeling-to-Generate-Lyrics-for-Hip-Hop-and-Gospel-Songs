This is pretty much the first lyrics release for this track entitled keep it scrubbin' off shaggy 2 dope's ep fuck the fuck off, hittin' stores feburary 21st. heres the lyrics for it; 
 See it's a big ass difference, 
 From the way I roll, 
 To the way you be doin' thing your whole plan smells booty hole, 
 Got ahead and get your false eye go ahead and pop your cris, 
 I be waitin' for your bitch ass behind the club sippin' old English, 
 It's somthin' about you mother fuckers I just can't stand, 
 Gotta push it between your butt cheeks but still call yourself a man, 
 Oh no! 
 You need your styalist you broke your little nail, 
 And your hair fell out of place when you had the little face spell, 
 Fuck that, 
 I'll drag my knuckles on concrete just to prepare, 
 For the moment I see you 
 Which I am gonna blow off your beard, 
 Skee mask strapped on tight, 
 Now days that how you gotta do, 
 Cause punk fucks like you get a black eye and wanna sue, 
 But me, 
 Yo' fuck it, 
 I keep it old school and dirty, 
 I keep my people happy, 
 And that's all the concerns me, 
 So go on and keep hatin' bitch we sick of your bullshit, 
 It's about time us scrubs shine, 
 I know juggalos are feelin' it, 
 Keep it scrubbin' 
 Take the underground up to the main stage, 
 Turn a hoe's shit around till we all get paid, 
 Keep it scrubbin, scrubbin, 
 Get it bubbalin', 
 Get the fuck out my way, 
 A scrub is steppin' in 
 Imma scrubby, she's a scrubby, won't you like to be a scrubby, 
 Getcha awards, 
 Say ya speech betta' make it count, 
 It's gonna be the last time words ever come out your mouth, 
 I'll be up in the balcony with a blow gun and poisones darts, 
 Like a silent assassin, 
 A ninja of sorts, 
 While your up in your corriagraphy practice with your glittery pants, 
 You'll here my outside with the ganger scrubs startin' juggalo chants, 
 And when you come outside bitch, don't get it confused, 
 It's me in the passenger side of my homeboys ride spittin' on you, 
 I remain a hulkamaniac, 
 Ain't afraid to spend food stamps, 
 Give a fuck what a bitch look like as long as she givin' up that ass, 
 And still grip my bucket, 
 Without a second thought, 
 Sport the same dwores for a week without takin' em' off, 
 And don't think for a second I'm scared of gettin' these hands dirty, 
 Cause your hands look just right cause you ain't my hands are stirdy, 
 So sooner or later your world and mine will be collidin', 
 And as scrubby as it may seem I'll always be psychopathic ridin', 
 Keep it scrubbin' 
 Take the underground up to the main stage, 
 Turn a hoe's shit around till we all get paid, 
 Keep it scrubbin, scrubbin, 
 Get it bubbalin', 
 Get the fuck out my way, 
 A scrub is steppin' in 
 Imma scrubby, she's a scrubby, won't you like to be a scrubby, 
 Now days, I just don't know this shits out of control, 
 Then ain't it cool to be a fag with gay shit up in the videos, 
 But fuck all that I'll bring it back down to a scrubs level, 
 Even if I smell a fruit I'll beat it down with a rusty shovel, 
 Preppy mutha fuckas roll around in they little benzes, 
 I'll be that freeway sniper with them telescope lenses, 
 These dickheads pokin' about in the world may not like what they find, 
 Then this scrub right here don't mind sometimes gettin' a little columnbined, 
 Keep it scrubbin' 
 Take the underground up to the main stage, 
 Turn a hoe's shit around till we all get paid, 
 Keep it scrubbin, scrubbin, 
 Get it bubbalin', 
 Get the fuck out my way, 
 A scrub is steppin' in 
 Imma scrubby, she's a scrubby, won't you like to be a scrubby to...
