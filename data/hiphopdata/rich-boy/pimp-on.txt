The money all good, but the game ain't change 
 Keep my bitches fresh, but I gotta get paid 
 I get my pimp on, I get my pimp on 
 The money all good, but the game ain't change 
 Keep my bitches fresh, but I gotta get paid 
 I get my pimp on, I get my pimp on 
 You want the whole truth, but the truth is I can tell it out 
 Pimping, I'm a boss, now watch it make a penny fall 
 Shit too real, but that gwap won't stop that when it's deal 
 Chasing deal, fucking hoes out in beverly hills 
 Pimping with the same game, that split the red sea 
 Pimping to the dirty green, my bitches pad missing fees 
 Cadillac's a grand prix, bumper coming down 
 I count paper, fuck niggas be talking out 
 Dollar bills get tossed up in the air just for the thrill 
 My compas feel, with so much service like a arse spill 
 I gotta get it, the game I play about the digits 
 You think I'm trickin paying for pussy, you can forget it! 
 The money all good, but the game ain't change 
 Keep my bitches fresh, but I gotta get paid 
 I get my pimp on, I get my pimp on 
 The money all good, but the game ain't change 
 Keep my bitches fresh, but I gotta get paid 
 I get my pimp on, I get my pimp on 
 First than foremost, I'm a motherfucking man 
 I ain't dealing with no hoolies, she got motherfucking stacks 
 While she work I keep that, what you motherfucking thank 
 Free the... bubble cars, and the henny not a thang 
 When it come to the hoes, man the kid got a lane 
 Ain't no bitch I can't scope, feel like lebronn james 
 I go hard on the slut, like a real ass nigga 
 She can hate my fuckin' cous but she love my pimpin' 
 Got my other hoe trippin', told my old caller 
 Lost a job last week bitch and I need more love 
 Born and fly hit the feet, that's how I ball up 
 She might be fine me on eyes, but all I see is dollas 
 The money all good, but the game ain't change 
 Keep my bitches fresh, but I gotta get paid 
 I get my pimp on, I get my pimp on 
 The money all good, but the game ain't change 
 Keep my bitches fresh, but I gotta get paid 
 I get my pimp on, I get my pimp on 
 How's, I used to pull up on them hoes and that nigga kinda... 
 With them gangster walls tucked behind them skirts 
 On that phantom, it's official pimping baby 
 This ain't no beginner, ain't no need to speak beats 
 Know you're fucking with a winner 
 She a loud wild, blowing on this dick at any moment 
 She ain't trippin', bust it open when I want it 
 She do it high like when I'm grippin on that waist line 
 Slammin' dick up in her, like I shook her took her baseline 
 Light it up, poured up, bossed up, fuck with us gonn cost us 
 Go so hard, fuck around and cause up 
 Real pimping, anythang else is absurd 
 Tricks smell it, I retell it, call me young iceberg 
 The money all good, but the game ain't change 
 Keep my bitches fresh, but I gotta get paid 
 I get my pimp on, I get my pimp on 
 The money all good, but the game ain't change 
 Keep my bitches fresh, but I gotta get paid 
 I get my pimp on, I get my pimp on.
