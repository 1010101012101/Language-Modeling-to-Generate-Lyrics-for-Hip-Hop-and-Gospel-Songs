 Fuck that other shit, hey, let's get this bread, homie 
 Remember when they could catch a charge down in Atlanta 
 They underestimate me 'cause I'm comin' from Alabama 
 Martin Lee, innocent, he ain't even have a chance 
 They beat him in that boot camp till he died in that ambulance 
 That boy was only fifteen years old, fuck what they say he did 
 So tell me how I'm 'posed to feel when police killin' kids? 
 And then we can't get a job, ridin' we get them pounds 
 If it ain't that coke then we get that 'dro and break it down

 You don't own nothin', you don't own you 
 The nigga playin' basketball, he don't own that jersey 
 He can't even be in a commercial with his name on the back 
 So when it's really all said and done 
 What did you do this for? What difference did you make? 
 You see how the world changin', yeah, they look so dumb, ain't it? 
 Wish they just kill 'em all, so now the Middle East, they bangin' 
 Preachers in that pulpit, say they teach that bullshit 
 So how we know it's bullshit? Same niggas I went to school with 
 Grabbin' on yo' nuts and disrespectin' get you merked 
 Well, them young niggas got pistol grips 
 They been about they killin' shit 
 But they all some hypocrites, haters, they won't let me be 
 When I come up to them gates, I hope you say you heard of me

 Hey nigga, time's harder, hey so we grind harder 
 We takin' chances with that cocaine comin' 'cross that border 
 Tryin' to make it up out this ghetto life, ain't gotta be this way 
 Them pigs, they came and kicked my mama do' in yesterday 
 I prayed a thousand nights, I did a hundred crimes 
 And now I'm beggin', Lord that you don't let me die this time 
 Money, my motivator, my mouth, my money maker
