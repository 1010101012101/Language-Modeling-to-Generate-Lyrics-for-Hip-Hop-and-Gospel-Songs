Good things don't last forever, baby

 Ain't no if's and but's or maybe's 
 You will always be my friend

 Say you'll always be my friend 
 She wanna know what's the reason 
 I'm saying she can be my friend 
 But baby, I'm a player, ain't no reason to pretend 
 Mighta seen me in MIA, ride a Phantom or the Benz 
 With a beautiful bitch, her hair blowin' in da wind 
 (See, I'm true to this shit) 
 Hope that you can comprehend 
 What I'm spittin' is pimpin' and the rules don't bend 
 Yup, you lookin' good but yo' mind ain't right 
 Some niggas been tellin' ya you're fine, all right 
 You gotta suit you need to let me put this iron in your life 
 Not the booze from behind, from the side how you like 
 I don't wanna spend forever witchu, baby, just tonight 
 If you can hop on my backseat that'll be a delight 
 From the looks of that ass you a nigga type 
 If you can bring me some cash, baby, you're Mrs. Right 
 You say you got a man and you don't know if this is right 
 That's why I need to be like Polow da Don 
 Good things don't last forever, baby

 Ain't no if's and but's or maybe's 
 You will always be my friend

 Say you'll always be my friend 
 You're the only girl that I wanna see daily 
 And a lot of hoes sayin' that you could be my lady 
 Let's take it to another level, remember the first day 
 I got you what you wanted and it wasn't even your birthday 
 Nah, now we kicked it too hard 
 You went too deep, you say you feel it in your heart 
 So I'ma be real 'cause you give me what I want 
 And I ain't gonna tell that I love you if I don't 
 I understand that you got a man at your crib 
 But he don't even care or understand how you feel 
 But if you stop comin' around and I don't see you again 
 I guess we could just be friends 
 Good things don't last forever, baby 
 There's something 'bout you girl that drives me crazy 
 Ain't no if's and but's or maybe's 
 You will always be my friend 
 You will always be 
 You will always be 
 Say you'll always be 
 You will always be my friend 
 Now ladies, I know y'all know what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 See, I don't want a man that just be dippin' in and out my life 
 Want a friend that's gon' be there through thick and thin 
 You know I'm sayin'? 
 Somebody to take it back to the Isleys 
 I want somebody to always come run back to me 
 And trust, I'ma be right here with that good thing 
 If I couldn't walk again, would you still be there for me? 
 If I lost it all today, would you care for me? 
 Yeah, would you write me in the pen? 
 Be kinda friend that'll be there without the Benz 
 Like I hit you from a bull, God sent me 
 You'll never ask me 'bout tha money that you lent me 
 Nah, you look good in Cavalli 
 You're the type of girl that the money can't buy me 
 Good things don't last forever, baby 
 There's something 'bout you girl that drives me crazy 
 Ain't no if's and but's or maybe's 
 You will always be my friend
