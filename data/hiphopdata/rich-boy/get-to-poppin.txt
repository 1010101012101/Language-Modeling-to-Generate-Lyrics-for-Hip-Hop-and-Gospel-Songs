Here I come 
 When niggas get to poppin' 
 Get, get down, get, get, g-get, get down 
 Get down, get, get, g-get 
 When niggas get to poppin' 
 Money, cars, stars, they be ballin' 
 Playas, pimps, dem hoes, dey be callin' 
 Microphone check, one, two, four 
 Who? Fourth is you 
 I shut da whole block down like motherfuckin' PD 
 Niggas wanna be me, dem fiends come to see me 
 Crack, rock, da block is hot 
 Dem niggas hatin' on me for da hoes dat I got 
 But I ain't even trippin' off a trick a bit 
 'Cause y'all motherfuckers, I ain't hittin' on shit 
 Broke ass nigga, joke ass nigga 
 Mess around and be a little smoke ass nigga 
 Rich Boy chillin', Polo chillin' 
 What mo' can I say, we 'bout millions 
 That's what we get, we got it good 
 And you know we in yo' hood 
 When niggas get to poppin' 
 Get, get down, get, get, g-get, get down 
 Get down, get, get, g-get 
 When niggas get to poppin' 
 Dem boys be stillin', dem boys dealin' 
 Up in da hood, dem boys killin' 
 I'm cold, put ya sweaters on like lil' Charlie Brown 
 I got enough rounds to lay da whole place down 
 Thirty-five thousand dollar watch 
 Two-hundred thousand dollar drop 
 Three million dollar spot, one, two, it don't stop 
 Bitch, get your money, hustle up, bubble ten double up 
 You a real motherfuckin' squirrel, tryna get a nut 
 From top to yo' bottom, dem hoes, I got 'em 
 Don't ask me how, don't know who shot 'em 
 You snitch ass nigga, bitch ass nigga 
 Mess around, getcha self killed, little nigga 
 Get, get down, get, get, g-get, get down 
 Get down, get, get, g-get 
 When niggas get to poppin' 
 Get, get down, get, get, g-get, get down 
 Get down, get, get, g-get 
 When niggas get to poppin' 
 Rich boy chillin', Polo chillin' 
 What more can I say? We 'bout millions 
 Dat's what we get, we got it good 
 And you know we in yo' hood 
 When niggas get to poppin' 
 When niggas get to poppin' 
 Get, get down, get, get, g-get, get down 
 Get down, get, get, g-get 
 When niggas get to poppin' 
 When niggas get to poppin'
