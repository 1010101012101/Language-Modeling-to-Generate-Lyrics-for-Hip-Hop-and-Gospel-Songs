Hey, Rich Boy, Lil' Jon 
 There's a lotta motherfuckin' bad bitches in this motherfucker 
 I think I'ma walk over to one of them motherfuckers and tell 'em this 
 What it do? What it be like? 
 Can I get your telephone number, baby? 
 What it do? What it be like? 
 Can I get your telephone number, girl? 
 What it do? What it be like? 
 Can I get your telephone number, baby? 
 What it do? What it be like? 
 I can picture you naked in the back of my Chevy 
 The cars, the clothes, the hoes, I know that 
 That purp, that kush, that dro, we blow that 
 We poppin', rollin', drinkin', smokin' 
 Puffin', passin', now we're chokin' 
 The paparazzi, snap and shoot me 
 The Prada, the Louis, the Fendi and the Gucci 
 The diamonds so big, she tell a nigga, "Look daddy" 
 A nigga so jealous that he don't wanna look at me 
 Nigga, look at me, why ya knockin'? 
 We ballin' and shoppin', them bottles poppin' 
 The rims, the paint, the ride so fly 
 The 28's be sittin' high 
 The lows, the mids, the highs, the tweeters 
 Bangin' hard, you hear my speakers 
 The trunk be knockin' 
 The bitches strippin', leanin', rockin' 
 What it do? What it be like? 
 Can I get your telephone number, baby? 
 What it do? What it be like? 
 Can I get your telephone number, girl? 
 What it do? What it be like? 
 Can I get your telephone number, baby? 
 What it do? What it be like? 
 I can picture you naked in the back of my Bentley 
 We ball, we shine, we all be grindin' 
 My chain, my ring, you see them diamonds 
 We leanin', sippin', drankin', pourin' 
 Promethazine that purple ocean 
 So what it do? Ya know ya boy 
 Ya know I gotta keep that toy 
 So pass the K, I make 'em feel me 
 These niggas hatin', tryin' to kill me 
 The seats in the ride like peanut butter and jelly 
 The pedal to the flo', I'm bossin' in the Chevy 
 Ooh, what it be like, baby? Yeah, show me 
 Some hoes wanna blow me but they don't even know me 
 My jewelry sick, it's so contagious 
 You see my wrist, this shit outrageous 
 Monte Carlos and Impalas 
 Money, rubber bands and dollars 
 What it do? What it be like? 
 Can I get your telephone number, baby? 
 What it do? What it be like? 
 Can I get your telephone number, girl? 
 What it do? What it be like? 
 Can I get your telephone number, baby? 
 What it do? What it be like? 
 We were meant to be naked
