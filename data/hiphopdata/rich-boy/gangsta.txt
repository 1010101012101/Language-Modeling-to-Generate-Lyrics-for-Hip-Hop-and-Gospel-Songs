 I bought my girl haha laughing at the rest 
 You act like you can make her wet 
 But you should be ashamed of that 
 I float the cash and make it back 
 You struggle tryin' to stack a stack 
 No matter what you know we strapped, where you at? 
 I flipped her first and then her cousin 
 Got that bread coming out the oven 
 Hydrocodin mixed with tusin 
 Kick them hoes I used to cuff, ain't fucking they 
 Now she drop it like a nugget 
 Super star but now she buggin, come her girl and show me something 
 I was turning up the bass, I was on a paperchase 
 Pen write with big bank, 50 on my briefcase 
 Bitch if you ain't cool enough who you think you foolin huh? 
 My wrist cold as a freezer got to get my dollars up

 You a gangsta ain't ya, riddled with ya finga 
 No time to cock it when niggas poppin' and you in danger 
 More money could it be, big dollars be calling me 
 This show ain't over with, there's so much more to see 
 Cadillac audis and nex ridin' around with 200 racks 
 Hustle hard take it to the max, purp loud comin' out the back 
 Dope boy be cookin that crack, blow that flip that back 
 Niggas already know my rap, a mill sold nigga look at that plaque 
 I turn power for cash pull up and drop the anchor 
 You scared to hustle that's more for me my nigga thank ya 
 My daily routine count cash jus like a banker 
 Back to the streets to get this cheese, this shit is gangsta

 Who do I see acting, pussy let me have it 
 Time for me to cash it, at the bank I'm laughing 
 Bumping and I'm blasting we puff it and pass it 
 Swerve it through the traffic coming like a 
 Hit them with the Apple juice getting drunk with no excuse 
 I'm guilty for drug abuse getting high and rolling too 
 Suckers see and try to be wish they would but can't be me 
 Niggas say they gangsta but they everythang except a G 
 Errtime you see me I bet you 
 High stuck up in the clouds no suckers in here allowed 
 Money speaks, on my mind cross with me and game time 
 365 24/7 the same grind
