Off in da gutter, got da hood hollerin' corner cutta 
 With Zone 4, them young money gettin' muthafukers 
 Hey, Rich Boy, go on and pass me da click toy 
 He spit boy and I'm gonna have to make 'em drip, boy 
 I'm sick and tired of all these niggas hollerin' cut throat 
 When they ain't never had to get away from po-po 
 Ain't never had to pay they bills from choppin' up coke 
 Ain't never ever seen the barrel of a chopper smoke 
 Hey, let them niggas out there know yo' name, folk 
 Who me? I'm Mark Twain, switch lanes 
 Flip change and always keep a extra clip, man 
 Blow da brains on damn near everything I roll, man 
 Been on my game every since them crocked folks came 
 Keep my hustle on da low and a bitch in her place 
 And if you yappin' out yo' mouth then tell it to my face 
 Full clip for niggas snitchin' when they catch a case 
 Boy, open up yo' mouth and tell me how this barrel taste 
 (Gangsta) 
 See da streets, they be callin' 
 See a young nigga ballin' 
 (Gangsta) 
 A young playa in the rap game 
 Ridin' 'round in a Lac, man 
 (Gangsta, gangsta) 
 Them niggas ain't like it when I went and brought a blue mink 
 So now they talkin' to da police at da precinct 
 But they ass don't know them laws on a payroll 
 Might see me in a ride that ain't even a day old 
 Talkin' real loud but you ain't sayin' nothin' 
 So stop frontin' 'cause them hoes for you ain't fuckin' 
 Keep truckin', looka here, boy, don't you stop here 
 It ain't magic but that glock will make you disappear 
 You're like a kid, nigga, still writin' love letters 
 You say you better but I'm still makin' more chedder 
 I'm too clever for these hoes to play me 
 Even crazy lazy ass hoes gon' pay me 
 I really hate when niggas talk too much 
 Just 'cause you got a strap don't mean you can't get touched 
 Find me in a two-seater wit a all wifebeater 
 Gettin' head from yo' bitch but yo' dumb ass see her 
 They say R I C H B O and Y 
 A P I M P bitch till I die 
 Sometimes I even have to ask myself why 
 Them niggas so goddamn fresh and so fly 
 (Gangsta) 
 See da streets they be callin' 
 See a young nigga ballin' 
 (Gangsta) 
 A young playa in the rap game 
 Ridin' 'round in a Lac, man
