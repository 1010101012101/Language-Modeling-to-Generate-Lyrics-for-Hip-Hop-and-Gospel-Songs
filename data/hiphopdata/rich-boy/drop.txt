My mazeradi and farrari like to chill with my mercades 
 See my bently what I got when my two phantoms had a baby 
 I'm not crazy why you lazy I get so politly daisy 
 Fuck you pussy nigga pay me my lambo do bout 280 
 I sellin heard you tellin' thought you killin' while you stealin 
 Thought you dealin' while you chillin' you ain't ballin with a million 
 God made me super rich the devil made you stupid bitch 
 You could be just like me if you quit with all that stupid shit 
 Why you ackin hard now you must wan go see God 
 Now the same niggas you were beefin with are up in your yard now 
 If you bout to run dogg I guess you better start now 
 Forgot to bring your gun so you got to use yo heart now 
 It's hard to get rich but it ain't shit to go to hell 
 It's hard to sell dope but it ain't shit to go to jail 
 It's hard to keep it real but it ain't shit for you to tell 
 I smoked so much of this that I can't even hide the smell 
 So drop 
 Drop [x3] 
 Now drop 
 Drop [x3] 
 We marijuana farmers all our rides look like transformers 
 Tell the pretty girls pull they titties out and dance for us 
 You don't need a gym class, crack like slim fast 
 Take a hit and loss a fuckin' hundred pounds quick fast 
 Snow cone with a chain on and deep off or chain off 
 My blunt goin' kick the game off we never take a game off 
 Find a hater sign a hater let him see my elavator 
 Hundreds in my fridgerator now they know we gettin' paper 
 Find a hater sign a hater let him see my elavator 
 Hundreds in my fridgerator now they know we gettin' paper 
 Pullin coupes and escaladers enimies on resperators 
 Million dollar generators 90 fast investagators 
 For flashing cars the prison bars manajaytwas the playin' cards I swear it's hard 
 Now drop
