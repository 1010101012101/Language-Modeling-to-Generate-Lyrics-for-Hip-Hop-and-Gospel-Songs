Once upon a time in an apartment home 
 Lived a little girl with a heart of stone 
 'Cause part of her heart was partly gone 
 Rarely seen and hardly known 
 Treated like a mat on a boxing ring 
 Blood drop stains on the twin box springs 
 Daddy came to visit, it's not a dream 
 She thought to herself, what is happenin'? 
 Above her head is a crucifix 
 But Lucifer loosens up his wrist 
 Lays her down with an open fist 
 And all that was left was hopelessness 
 Little girl, where's your lovin' mother? 
 Under the covers, under the covers 
 Little girl what have you discovered 
 She stuttered 
 Growin' up in the gutter, no more, fairytales 
 And so no place like hell, no place like home 
 Growin' up in the gutter, black and white in a frame 
 There we are, safe and sound, stray guns, no aim, yea 
 Growin' up in the gutter 
 And you ain't gotta be from the Projects 
 To deal with this nonsense, Rittz 
 'Cause even in suburbia somebody will murder ya 
 Over nothin', leave your body slumpin' 
 In the parking lot of your complex 
 Violence is a hard pill to swallow and digest 
 My town is full of drug dealers 
 Most of them get shot in the process 
 Hustlin' and stackin' up profits 
 They robbin' motherfuckers like they havin' a contest 
 Shit, he took a bitch to his apartment to brag 
 A week later he tied up on the carpet and gagged 
 'Cause he showed her all the pills he had for sale 
 For the low 
 She told her cousin 
 Then her cousin grabbed a glock and a mask 
 Kicked in his door laid him down 
 Then he shot him and dashed 
 Ran off with all that he had 
 He used to be ballin' now he got a colostomy bag 
 What you know about that 
 Middle class white bitch slangin' her body for crack 
 Mexican drug cartels, you hear the buck shot shells 
 And then the blood clot fails, there ain't no healin' the wounds 
 Biggest meth bust on the east coast right here in Duluth 
 My lyrics are proof of growin' up in the gutter 
 You think you can define how hard you got it? 
 By what neighborhood you live in motherfucker 
 Wake up in the gutter 
 Growin' up in the gutter, no more, fairytales 
 And so no place like hell, no place like home 
 Growin' up in the gutter, black and white in a frame 
 There we are, safe and sound, stray guns, no aim, yea 
 Growin' up in the gutter 
 Slumerican indeed, I am 
 Drug through the mud like a weed, what I am 
 Was child who was beat, I am 
 Leather belts that made me, I am 
 Home alone again at 8, I am 
 Somebody's life to rate, I am 
 Given to the beast by fate, I am 
 The one who did escape, I am 
 A voice for the cold in the dark, I am 
 The one who sold his heart, I am 
 From a family torn apart, I am 
 A target for your dart, I am 
 Sick again from the whips, I am 
 Head to the gun and click, I am 
 A soul that don't run from shit, I am 
 Exposed to the g.o.a.t.s. of sin, I am 
 Met a ghost and he said, "I am" 
 In the basement in red, I am 
 Dead cause the Ouija board said 
 I-a-m 
 Growin' up in the gutter, no more, fairytales 
 And so no place like hell, no place like home 
 Growin' up in the gutter, black and white in a frame 
 There we are, safe and sound, stray guns, no aim, yea 
 Growin' up in the gutter
