Trunk Muzik 
 Trunk Muzik 
 Straight from the back of the game I rock it 
 (Yelawolf's got that crack, boy) 
 In the woods with the SK I'm cockin' 
 (You don't want to play with that toy) 
 Droppin' this heat like a... (Asteroid) 
 Good in the south like (Pastor Troy) 
 Pull up inside of a 1977 
 Sittin' back and sippin my crown and seven 
 Pimpin' I'm about to get down 
 Look at me (changin' lanes) 
 Twin pipes lookin' like dragon's breath (ROO) 
 Chevrolets throwin' flames 
 Yes I 
 Know it's strange 
 Hit you in the left eye (Hold the change) 
 Bitch I'm too heavy to carry 
 You don't wanna bury yourself 
 Underneath the 808 I'm droppin' 
 It in your face like (Uuughh) 
 To the DJ's 
 Out cruisin' 
 I got that Trunk Muzik 
 Everybody hop in the Cadillac 
 And idle back on the throttle 
 And Chevrolet's with the bottom won't you roll the window down 
 If you cruisin' 
 I got that Trunk Muzik 
 Alabama's unanimous animal Yelawolf 
 From the 808 come and fade away ain't no better way to get down 
 I told you I was comin' 
 Said id be here in 5 
 And even though I brought you glasses 
 You still can't believe your eyes 
 But if you don't believe it by now 
 FUCK it just lean to the side 
 Hold up wait a minute I don't really 
 Wanna leave without a single solitary 
 Soul in need of what I'm bringing to him 
 Be a sail and catch my drift 
 Lead me to the door check my list 
 Meet me at the floor catch this fist 
 Or meet me at the store catch this lick 
 Build this house flip this brick 
 Real skateboarders feel this grip 
 Moving threw the alley way 
 And look at all the people trippin' 'cause I'm on it choppin' like...

 I have to be the hardest I have diamond nuts 
 I piss excellence ricky bobby lines them up 
 Catfish Billy half pints 'em up 
 Yelawolf country fries'em up 
 Put'em in dufflebag and roll 'em up in the river then I... 
 Hold Up 
 Watch what the fuck you hold up 
 Dynamite sticks will blow up 
 Ghet-O-Vision got this sewed up 
 Roll up smoke up 
 Everybody wishin' they chose us 
 But we don't give a fuck you know what 
 I know you didn't see me comin' but I'm comin' anyway 
 Bitch Yelawolf is stylin' on yee ROO...
