Man this fuckin' bitch, All took off, Fuckin' with some, College graduate, Punk ass, Abercrombie wearin mother fucker, Left me broken hearted in the Chevy, It's all good though, Know why?, I got me bitch! 
 Both of us was in the same class 
 In 02 in Antioch Nash-Ville 
 I wanted you so bad 
 That I forgot to mind my manners 
 Everybody wanted them panties 
 Every guy was hopin to land it 
 We would flirt around and touch hands 
 Until we fucked around and took Xanax 
 And that's when you began to drive me bananas 
 I was in denial its apparent 
 You began to lie to your parents 
 You should know that I can't live without you holdin' my name 
 Now my hearts in control of my brain 
 And I can't hold it in the lanes 
 Rollin' down 20 main 
 With this Jack in my cup, feelin' down on my luck 
 And I'm doin' 120 main 
 Maybe I'm givin' up, Baby I'm givin' up 
 Baby what is happenin'? 
 Don't you believe in us, Don't you believe in us? 
 She said I know you gave me everything 
 But love is not enough 
 Love is not enough 
 Love is not enough... 
 Used to fuck so much we missed school 
 You was there when I needed you 
 I was there when you needed me 
 We were Inseparable 
 When I was broke with no fuckin' food 
 You was tough enough to be cool 
 Skate holes all in my shoes 
 Dope boys had me confused 
 I was in love with hip hop 
 You was in love with that too 
 What made it come to a stop 
 Had to have been the money issue 
 Bitch! And I really miss the rain 
 I gave you all of my soul and all I got left is a key chain 
 Who the fuck are you fuckin' now? 
 Bet hes always taken you out 
 College educated and proud 
 Me, Well I'm just a drop out 
 Can't really blame you for buggin 
 Ain't I the dirt on your rug and 
 Just a place to wipe your shoes and 
 Give me all your throw away lovin' 
 Back to my buzzin and druggin 
 Back to my gutter with nothin' 
 Back to the rut all the sudden 
 Cracks in the covenant trustin me 
 You ain't gotta worry bout sharin this success with Wayne 
 And that was just petty change 
 But I still feel the pain
