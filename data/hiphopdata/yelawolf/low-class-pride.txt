Raise your glass for the people with trash bag blinds (Eminem: Raise it!) 
 You like to judge, but I find that you don't ask why (Eminem: Oh no uhuh) 
 Kiss my ass if you ain't on our side (Eminem: Kiss it!) 
 We'll be on all sides 
 Surround you, this is low class pride 
 Hey girl I like that famous hoodie, do it come in camo? 
 A pack of Camels and I'm goodie with a little Daniels 
 The Chevy wired got the 24 tires 
 24 hours wired ain't tired 
 Bottles on floor smoke swirling spirals around the wood panels 
 Every porch got an old man picking on them teeth with a switchblade 
 Cut your hand hopping the barbed wire fence 
 You fix that motherfucker up with some grip tape 
 Shaved heads and dreads it's all good my town 
 Gotta get some blood on your shoes 
 If you wanna be you wanna eat good in my town 
 Got a good memory you solve that problem with a lil liquor 
 Lil sister gone hungry no more 
 Ever since my hands got a lil quicker 
 Snatch a meal and a pack to calm the nerves 
 How you gonna pay when time is all you earn?

 Most you people don't know shit 
 About the cabins in the boonies and the muddy footprints 
 Following to your doorstep when your momma 
 Out of work and can't pay the rent 
 Asking how we gonna make some stacks 
 So we make mistakes pay the tab 
 They putting dollars on our heads, crack our heads everyday 
 Mr. Sherriff take it back 
 I never done shit but grind boards and party, how you gonna ask me where I'm going? 
 My buddy JC down on the block, and early release (???) showing 
 (???) Smog in the air leaves that chemical on your tongue 
 We ain't dumb but round these parts ain't much to become 
 So we party, we drink, we smoke when we young 
 Yeah buddy ain't nothing like where I'm from 
 Raise your glass for the people with trash bag blinds (Eminem: Raise it!) 
 You like to judge, but I find that you don't ask why (Eminem: Oh no uhuh) 
 Kiss my ass if you ain't on our side (Eminem: Kiss it!)
