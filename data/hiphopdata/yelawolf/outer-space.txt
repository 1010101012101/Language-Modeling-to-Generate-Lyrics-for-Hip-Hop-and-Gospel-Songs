Kick me out the house? 
 Should kick your ass out the house 
 Call me a piece of shit? You're a piece of shit 
 Awh, come on ... the fuck? 
 What the ... the fuck is? 
 What the fuck? Awh fuck ... HEY! 
 Hey, hey ... let me out 
 Let me out ... this is not fuckin' funny 
 HEY! ... oh ... oh FUCK! 
 Oh Shiiiit... 
 No... 
 I am that motherfucker, Lord give me that deuce deuce 
 I'm out the roof like a chimney sweep 
 I'm on Jack and cola 
 Oh, snap that boy's about to go go bi, bi, bipolar 
 Dead at midnight, out like a convict 
 Trick I'm losing my shit, watch this 
 Throw a bottle, Fuck the world 
 I need fight tunes and mushrooms, I'm tripping 
 (Chicka Chicka) Who's bad? 
 Baby it's my turn, I want all of it 
 Hey, let's go 
 Look at 'em hating on a trailer park pimp 
 Who? Me 
 It's a problem ain't it, man 
 You're fucking white, you better get used to it 
 Catfish Billy man 
 Check the 5-0, in the rear-view 
 Scheming on the Chevy cause the Chevy's a clear view 
 Tires wet, pulling me over 
 With tattoos, I'm a pistol holder 
 An American fuck up, money like a crook 
 And I'm spending G's like I'm buying a soda 
 Check me out, CEO 
 Got pull like a monster truck so what's up 
 I earn my (shit), respect is a must 
 You fuck around with me (shit) 
 In the slug I trust 
 I got the Mossberg (shit) 
 Don't make me load that pump 
 James Brown motherfucker (shit) 
 I took her... I took her to the breakdown like this 
 Give me everything, take it all away 
 Lock me up and then throw away the key 
 Kick me down and then talk about my state 
 I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space 
 I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space 
 I'm not out of place, I'm from outer space
