(Yelawolf) 
 Hillbilly in Beverly hills 
 And so Drama beats. 
 (Yelawolf - Verse 1) 
 Hold up 
 Damn rich, peanut butter guts in a Lamorghini, whoa 
 You must have white bread, lets make a sandwich 
 I ain't never seen money you got 
 Nobody got that kind of money in the Boondocks 
 So if you take me up show me the Balcony lookin' over 
 The Hollywood valley I'll make your balloon pop 
 Popstars like you, you need a dude like me 
 To appreciate your wealth 
 I know you got an elevator in your house 
 But with me you'll appreciate the steps 
 Act like you don't wanna see how much of this Jack Daniels you can handle 
 You wanna drink and get cut like Rambo 
 And let me drive your Daddy's Lambo 
 Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion 
 Let me see Hollywood for real 
 Lights, camera, action 
 I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel 
 One thing I gotta know 
 Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo? 
 Lambo-o-oh 
 Lambo-o-oh 
 Your Daddy's Lambo? 
 Lambo-o-oh 
 Lambo-o-oh 
 Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo? 
 (Yelawolf - Verse 2) 
 Your young and reckless, nice little diamond necklace 
 Got a pint sized vodka drink and your pretty in pink 
 Wanna go get breakfast 
 Though you ain't never been to waffle house 
 Always hanging in guys and dolls 
 If you came to the shop, I'll put you in the Chevrolet 
 And we'd slide to the mall 
 Yeah I came to the club in a pair of Famous jeans and DTA hoody 
 But I'm off to the party with rogue status looking for Beverly Hills goody's 
 Yelawolf and I'm an Alabama boy 
 Got more bounce than a salamander boy 
 Need a rich girl like I need a headache 
 But I can take it if I can drive your Daddy's toy 
 Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion 
 Let me see Hollywood for real 
 Lights, camera, action 
 I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel 
 One thing I gotta know 
 Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo? 
 Lambo-o-oh 
 Lambo-o-oh 
 Your Daddy's Lambo? 
 Lambo-o-oh 
 Lambo-o-oh 
 Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo? 
 (Yelawolf - Verse 3) 
 What you got in that tote bag 
 That one of a kind Prada 
 That beautiful behind inspires me 
 Makes one of my rhymes harder 
 Your daddy made a fine daughter 
 Make me wanna turn this wine from water 
 Keep the party going in and keep an 808 bumping cause Drama made a beat that'll climb the charta 
 Money, money, money, money, money 
 Ain't it funny what a hunny in a Lambourghini will do 
 Some will run into a hundred dollar bill 
 And drill a dick in any Tom and Harry with a 24 inch shoe 
 But come and explore this dude 
 Analyze my swing 
 It's Slick Rick E. Bobby baby 
 Gotta let me drop that thing, come on 
 Take me up to Beverly Hills to your Daddy's mansion 
 Let me see Hollywood for real 
 Lights, camera, action 
 I've seen you partying with keel, entertainment channel 
 One thing I gotta know 
 Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo? 
 Lambo-o-oh 
 Lambo-o-oh 
 Your Daddy's Lambo? 
 Lambo-o-oh 
 Lambo-o-oh 
 Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo? 
 Just whip it around you know 
 Up the hills 
 I ain't gon wreck it, I promise
