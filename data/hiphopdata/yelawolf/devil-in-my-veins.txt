(Woman) 
 Michael Wayne, I love you my darling. May angels and spirits of mercy stay beside you 
 (Yelawolf) 
 All right, I love you 
 (Woman) 
 I love you too. Bye 
 Lately I've been afraid of myself 
 The closer that I get to rain 
 The more I feel at home, the further I'm away 
 And all that I feel is pain 
 Count me, count me, call my name 
 Don't leave me out the chain 
 Crimson tears falling and my shirt is blood-stained 
 And the devil's forever in my veins 
 And the devil's forever in my veins 
 The morning's across I've been when I wake 
 Am I asleep? Have I broken my faith? 
 Down on my knees, can you hear me when I pray? 
 Or am I a little too late to... 
 Count me, count me, call my name 
 Don't leave me out the chain 
 Crimson tears falling and my shirt is blood-stained 
 And the devil's forever in my veins 
 And the devil's forever in my veins
