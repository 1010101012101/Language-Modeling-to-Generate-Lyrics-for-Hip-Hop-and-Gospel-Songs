Yeah, hell of a day to load a .22 and take it to the woods 
 And let it ring into the night and break a bottle 
 With the bullet, yes, I'm 'bout it, motherfucker 
 Not a single solitary thing is missin' from my southern roots 
 I'm liable just to take a Chevrolet and run it through the mud for giggles 
 Huh, what? A son of a bitch my momma raised into a rapper 
 Who could tell story like my uncle when he's drinkin' 
 Product of a workin' environment, fuck is y'all thinkin'? 
 Meanin' I'm workin', workin' harder 
 Than any artist can ever do it simply 'cause I'm made that way 
 I build a house around your ass before you could realize 
 That you were in the neighborhood that Yelawolf made 
 So call me a redneck and tell your boys about it 
 Tell 'em I'm an Alabama wanna-be, I be that 
 I'll just take it to the studio and drop a bomb on you 
 From a motherfuckin' beanbag, I need that 
 Get away, tell my folks roll up the J's 
 Bring Yelawolf a deuce, we'll sit up on the roof of the broken Chevrolet 
 Talk 'til there's nothing left to say 
 'Cause if I don't get away you gonna see my trailer park ghetto ways 
 Then you gon' have to get away from me 
 Drink some, smoke some 
 You gon' have to get away from me 
 Load up the gun, load up the gun 
 Then you'll have to get away from me 
 Drink some, smoke some 
 'Cause if I don't get away 
 You gonna see my trailer park ghetto ways 
 Then you gone have to get away from me 
 Man, I done been through it all 
 I done been up and know what it is to fall 
 Punk police feeling all on my balls 
 Without a probable cause 'cause a nigga sittin' tall 
 "Dawg, you gotta do something Fatt 
 On the road with Wolf, why did you come back?" 
 'Cause them up there don't wanna play fair 
 Got me pinned to the wall like a fucking thumb tack 
 "Dumb fat" 
 Dumb hell, criticize a nigga for the crack I sell 
 Like you could give a shit if a nigga eat well 
 Or eat at all, wanna see me fall 
 Let 'em see that? Naw dawg 
 Them lies only 'cause I got Catfish on my side 
 Bitch, I'm headed up, up to the sky 
 Roll up, let's get high 
 Wavin' them bye, I need that 
 Get away, tell my folks roll up the J's 
 Bring Yelawolf a deuce 
 We'll sit up on the roof of the broken Chevrolet 
 Talk 'til there's nothing left to say 
 'Cause if I don't get away 
 You gonna see my trailer park ghetto ways 
 Then you gon' have to get away from me 
 Drink some, smoke some 
 You gon' have to get away from me 
 Load up the gun, load up the gun 
 Then you'll have to get away from me 
 Drink some, smoke some 
 'Cause if I don't get away 
 You gonna see my trailer park ghetto ways 
 Then you gone have to get away from me 
 20 plus 20, still spittin' 'em out 
 Still piss on your porch and still shit in your house 
 Then put my dick in your mouth 
 Take it back out, put it back in 
 Fuck on the floor, skeet on the couch 
 Which one of you ugly motherfuckers 
 Think you thug enough or rugg enough 
 Or gutter enough, fast enough to keep up with me 
 The most retarded motherfucker in the whole wide world 
 Ain't stupid or dumb enough to fuck with me 
 If you in, say you in 
 And if you is handle your motherfuckin' business 
 Knuckle up, buckle up, hustle up, huddle up 
 What we gonna do? Win 
 Not a nan' 'nother nigga out of there can compare 
 To what I do to these boys on these bars and these scales 
 In these clubs in these bars on these tables and chairs 
 I need that 
 Get away, tell my folks roll up the J's 
 Bring Yelawolf a deuce 
 We'll sit up on the roof of the broken Chevrolet 
 Talk 'til there's nothing left to say 
 'Cause if I don't get away 
 You gonna see my trailer park ghetto ways 
 Then you gon' have to get away from me 
 Drink some, smoke some 
 You gon' have to get away from me 
 Load up the gun, load up the gun 
 Then you'll have to get away from me 
 Drink some, smoke some 
 'Cause if I don't get away 
 You gonna see my trailer park ghetto ways 
 Then you gone have to get away from me
