How 'bout a ride 
 Yeah you 
 Would you like to sit inside of this pontoon? 
 Sip shroom tea while the sun sets over my new seats in the Caprice goes boom boom 
 That's right-bright like the headlights highbeams 
 I should get a ticket the way I lean 
 Robbin these rappers like me and Irene 
 Oops that's Dick and Jane 
 Oops that's my dick and chain 
 I took a shot of Jack D and I threw the dice on the board like it was a Christmas game 
 Milo you got tube sox and a box of Krispy Kreme 
 And a wish list for the business in the back of the whip with this mystic mane 
 Baby don't shoot me down 
 No I don't know shit about you but you got a pretty face and the booty's round 
 Don't get moody now 
 Show me the sound I'm new to town 
 Got a tank of gas so lets cruise around 
 Wanna spank that ass and get booty loud 
 Uh did I say that? 
 Nevermind baby girl just lay back 
 Not in the way back of a Maybach but the suede that's made where the queens lay at 
 So you ride around in a Chrysler but my Chevy fits the best 
 Well get ride of that Oldsmobile, Oldsmobiles cut-less
