Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me? 
 And everything I'm holding close, is so far away from me? 
 They don't want me to love it, they don't wanna hear the truth 
 It never made sense to me 
 Why is everything I love the most, is so wrong for me! 
 Yeah! Problematic, I'm so problematic 
 That I'm probably a problem addict 
 Pop an aspirin cause my head is hurting 
 Hotel bedroom, missing curtains 
 Sheets everywhere like a storm has passed 
 In fact it looks like I got into a wrestlin' match 
 Empty bottle of Jack, I could tell after that 
 I could smell it in fact, it's like death and ass 
 Think for a minute if I look over and look 
 To my left is an opened book, a Bible 
 To my right is a guilty conscience and her name is Brooke, my rival 
 At least I think her name was Brook 
 She's asleep, and I'm givin' her the lamest look 
 Move her hair back so that I could see your face 
 Cause it was dark and I met her at the game it took 
 About five minutes to get her inside the whip 
 Another five minutes to get up inside the lips 
 Never try really, man not tryna slip, ah! But it was just thighs and hips 
 OK, I was high, shit 
 On alcohol and the Yelawolf ego trip 
 And it's the walk of shame again! 
 Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me? 
 And everything I'm holding close, is so far away from me? 
 They don't want me to love it, they don't wanna hear the truth 
 It never made sense to me 
 Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me! 
 Smokin' out, throwin' up 
 Keep a fifth off in my cup 
 Trying not to be a simp 
 But every time I take a sip 
 I think I'm gonna fall in lust 
 I'm back and forth like I'm packing a truck 
 In a house that never runs out of boxes 
 Knowing that if I put on my tennis shoes 
 And a fresh fit, I'll end up sockless 
 By the end of the night, flip flopping 
 I'll B-Boy if you let me Hip Hop in 
 Alligator skin cowgirl boots only means let's get it crockin' 
 That mini skirt makes any man a flirt 
 Manicures animal furs and a purse 
 What could a little bit a smoke and Henny hurt? 
 You make any jerk make a penny work 
 Sinister with sin in her 
 She can leave a devil sitting in the church 
 On another level not in the earth 
 Jessica Alba had twins at birth 
 Trippin' sure, piles of E, m√©nage-a-trois, piles of three 
 Waking up again not proud of me 
 Yeah, I'm a lousy fiend 
 Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me? 
 And everything I'm holding close, is so far away from me? 
 They don't want me to love it, they don't wanna hear the truth 
 It never made sense to me 
 Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me! 
 Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me? 
 And everything I'm holding close, is so far away from me? 
 They don't want me to love it, they don't wanna hear the truth 
 It never made sense to me 
 Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me!
