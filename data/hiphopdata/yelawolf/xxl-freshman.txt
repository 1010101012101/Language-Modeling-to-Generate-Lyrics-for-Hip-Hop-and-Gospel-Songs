Hell of a day to load a 22 and take it to the woods 
 And then bring it to a body 
 And somebody muthaf-cka not in solitary thinks it missin' from my 
 Manage to take a Cheverolet run up through the muthaf-cking mud, forget it 
 Hell of son of a bitch my momma raised into a rapper who could tell a story like my uncle when he's drinking 
 Product of a working environment, f-ck is y'all thinking 
 Meaning I'm working working harder than any artist could ever do it, simply 'cause I'm made that way 
 I run a house around ya ass before you could realise that you in a neighbourhood that Yelawolf made 
 So call me a relic and tell ya boys 'bout it tell 'em I'm an Alabama wanabe 
 I be there, I just take it to the studio and just drop a bomb on it from a muthaf-cking beanie bag. I need that 
 Shady!
