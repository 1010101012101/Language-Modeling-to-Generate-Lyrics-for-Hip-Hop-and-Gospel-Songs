Daddy is up five AM again, it's a repeated scene 
 He's been at since ten 
 Nine to five hours don't pay enough money 
 He took a third-shift and he's just gettin' in 
 Babies are hungry and mommy is bitchin' 
 'Bout bills that he need to go pay while he sittin' 
 Not even five minutes to drink a cold beer before hearing about what was left in the kitchen 
 Walk out the door for a walk to the store, bread was five dollars he only had four 
 Won't get a check till the first of next week and he said to himself I can't take anymore 
 With no heat in the house and no gas in the truck, and his four-year-old's birthday about to come up 
 It's gun, mask, duct-tape, gloves, now 
 What would you do for love? (ooh) 
 What would you do for love? 
 What would you do for love? (ooh) 
 What would you do for love? 
 What would you do for love? (ooh) 
 She's a single mother livin' in a hotel in the south side of the city 
 And she works at a bar in the strip to get tips savin' up for a place that is pretty 
 A twelve-year-old son to support, still in school with a father that's never around 
 He took her virginity, promised infinity 
 Then he took off and he hasn't been found 
 Most of the people she already knows 
 Have trouble survivin' and keepin' a home 
 That side of town ain't the place to raise a child 
 But she's doing her best and there's no where to go 
 Puts on a skirt, picks up her purse 
 He knows just what she does 
 His mama can't work at the bar every night 
 So his mama is hustlin' and sellin' drugs 
 What would you do for love? (ooh) 
 What would you do for love? 
 What would you do for love? (ooh) 
 What would you do for love? 
 What would you do for love? (ooh) 
 (Woohoo, woohoo) 
 (Woohoo, woohoo) 
 (Outro Hook) 
 What would you do for love? (ooh) 
 What would you do for love? 
 What would you do for love? (ooh) 
 What would you do for love? 
 What would you do for love? (ooh) 
 What would you do for love? 
 What would you do for love? (ooh) 
 What would you do for love? 
 What would you do for love? (ooh) 
 What would you do for love?
