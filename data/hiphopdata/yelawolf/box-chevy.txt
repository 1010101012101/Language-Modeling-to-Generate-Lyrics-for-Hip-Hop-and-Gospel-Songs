 (Verse 2 - Rittz) 
 Fuck a limosine rather ride ride caprices 
 My speakers vibrate the concrete beneath us 
 Ridin' 85 northbound shakin doors down 
 So I turn da speakers louder pissin off polices 
 Fuck 5-star chick, gotta porn-star bitch ridin' shotgun wit me gettin' so wet 
 Now she goin' down on me givin' road head bussin on her fourhead, 
 Then I take her back to the homestead Peace 
 Back in the caprice took a sack of weed and crumpled it inside a conyak blunt rack 
 Then its time to jump back on the highway 85 slumpin in the seat like I'm hunckback and 
 My chevy look so dope oldskool vo's on it got it floatin like a row boat, 
 Gold flakes in the paint drippin on the road, drivin' slow like a show boat hoe 
 Don't act like you don't hear me comin' I got the ?? and its comin' out the clarions 
 12's in the trunk, flatscreens in the headrest wit somethin' bout Marion carry on 
 I be turnin' heads every time when you see in the chevy man she carstruck 
 And I'm far from hauled up supp witt-her trippin' like a bitch 
 Get in the car slut you know you wanna ride. 
 My rims are super clean, paint job dat glitters and gleams, 
 And I wanna see da back of your jeans in the seats (MY BOX CHEVY) 
 This whip is built for Queens and you wanna be seen witta King, 
 Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in seats (MY BOX CHEVY) 
 Tilted off Jim Bean, sittin' off to the side I lean, 
 And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats (MY BOX CHEVY) 
 This whip is built for Queens and you wanna be seen witta King, 
 Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in seats (MY BOX CHEVY)

 Peanut butter seats have seat girl my panut buteer needs (JELLY) I'll chase you like (JELLY)

 Feelin' like a deuce deuce bigalow 
 Played the da bitch like piccolo 
 Go anywhere you wanna go pick a road 
 Interstae 59 20 75 285 85 southbound 
 Twins pipes like POW POW, 100 spokes on the vo's like wow... wow... wow
