I usually don't do this but fuck it 
 You know what? 
 You're like the hardest thing I've ever seen 
 And I'm from the gutter so believe me I've seen some hard things 
 You come from where the black flower grows 
 I wanted to cut you down and take you home call me Axl Rose 
 I could see you in a 1976 Camaro 
 Me and you, sippin' whiskey getting drunker than Jack Sparrow 
 It's Black Sabbath, how you get mellow 
 Well, put your feet on Harley Davidson pedals and rock and roll, girl 
 Like a diamond cuts through a pearl 
 This the hardest love song in the world 
 (Hardest love song, in the world) 
 You could get it in with your girl 
 Yeah, the hardest love song in the world 
 (Hardest love song, in the world) 
 You don't got to drive a Fleetwood Cadillac 
 You just got to know some of words to Fleetwood Mac 
 Horror movies turn you on, pull the sheets back 
 Fuck it, I role play, do it to you in a Jason mask 
 You switch walkers like a switch blade 
 You walk into the room and it's like 
 These other bitches get hit with a grenade 
 With that said, let me pull them spandex pants off 
 You with my teeth like Ozzy did a bat head 
 I like rock and roll, let's go 
 Like a diamond cuts through a pearl 
 This the hardest love song in the world 
 (Hardest love song, in the world) 
 You could get it in with your girl 
 Yeah, the hardest love song in the world 
 (Hardest love song, in the world) 
 You ain't concerned with new clothes or salaries 
 You would rather run across the country like Mickey and Mallory 
 Be the natural born killer that you are 
 We'll hang out the window with a pistol and I drive the car 
 We'll rob a dollar general for nothing but snack food 
 Shooting anything that moves, dogs and cats too 
 Re-enact the hardest movie scenes, bloody shirts and holy jeans 
 We the hardest you and me, rock and roll, baby 
 Like a diamond cuts through a pearl 
 This the hardest love song in the world 
 (Hardest love song, in the world) 
 You could get it in with your girl 
 Yeah, the hardest love song in the world 
 (Hardest love song, in the world) 
 Click bang 
 Click bang like magic 
 Yeah, the hardest love song in the world
