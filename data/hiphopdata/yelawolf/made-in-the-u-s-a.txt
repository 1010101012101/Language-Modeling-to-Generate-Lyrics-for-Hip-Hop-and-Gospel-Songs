Yeah, land of the free, home of the hard 
 Home of the tough, survivors 
 We some gun toting, church going, 18-wheel rolling 
 Bag slanging, flag waving, at the dinner table praying 
 Old school yard fighting, beer drinking, hell raising 
 Hard working, blue collar, earn it all due paying 
 Illegal weed smoking, dope cooking, dirt dealers 
 On the corner Bible preachers, Hollywood dream seekers 
 Muddy water swimming in rock an' roll all the time 
 Straight from the assembly line and that's how it's made 
 That's how it's made in the U.S.A., the U.S.A. 
 A manufactured dream, a fraction of a thing 
 We got it made, in the U.S.A., the U.S.A. 
 Isn't it great? How we got it made 
 We some 9 to 5 back breaking, food Stamp line waiting 
 Convict time giving, underage time taking 
 Neighborhood gang banging, subway graffiti painting 
 Big cars, street stars, young dirty money making 
 Old money home taking, clothes in the yard throwing 
 Late on the rent paying, foul mouth word saying 
 One-way street paving 
 Road to success but you gotta do some concrete laying 
 That's how it's made 
 That's how it's made in the U.S.A., the U.S.A. 
 A manufactured dream, a fraction of a thing 
 We got it made, in the U.S.A., the U.S.A. 
 Isn't it great? How we got it made 
 She's been eating lies we fed her 
 Shoulda been full but nothing's helping 
 Knew she wanted something better 
 Still she took the second helping 
 Now she's well known, broke and cold 
 Fendi jackets, full of holes, no one knows 
 Single mother child raising from the stripper poll swinging 
 Daughter in the red light, coals for the cold season 
 She don't speak, no reason, why? 'Cause no one will ever know 
 That's what? That's how it's made 
 That's how it's made, in the U.S.A. the U.S.A. 
 It's every mother's dream to see her daughter on her knees 
 Well we got it made, in the U.S.A., the U.S.A. 
 Isn't it great? How we got it made 
 That's how it's made in the U.S.A.
