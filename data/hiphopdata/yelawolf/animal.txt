They should've never ever let you out 
 Going down, 'em all with the mouth from the south 
 What you gonna say, what you gonna do? 
 As you know they're coming, coming after you 
 Watch out for the D-Boys 
 Watch out for the boys in blue 
 You better keep it moving 
 (Big Boy) 
 You know they're taking shots at you 
 'Cause you're an animal, oh 
 Here we go 
 Alabama's own buddy promenade 
 And I'm in the zone now everybody 
 Bringing 'em home, baby, tour da stage 
 Slick Rick E. Bobby in a Nascar 
 Running up on motherfuckers like I'm in a bar 
 Sentimental motherfuckers in a cookie jar 
 Be the late night snack, I'm Santa Clause 
 Down to Panama beach, drunk in my underalls 
 Playing underwear volleyball with ya bra 
 I ain't bothered by your triple D's, not at all 
 Let me hold 'em up for ya, baby, while you walk 
 Wanna get the party bumping, let me do my thing 
 Get the marijuana, plant need watering 
 Throw it in a bong, let it start bubbling 
 Know what I mean, Butterbean bada-bada-bing 
 Trashy white, pass the mic, yeah, I'm doing 'em dirty 
 Fists start pumping when I'm in the lights like I'm rapping in Jersey 
 Never get elegant in elementary, never learned to write in cursive 
 Raised by the country B-Boys, I'm elegantly perfect 
 Rack it in, pack 'em in to the back again 
 Rap it up, rap it in, sicker than a pack of 10 mini thins 
 You'll get when I win but I won't lose 
 In fact I'm gonna win, win again with another hand 
 Here's another hand, here's another hand 
 Dealer, can I get another hand? 
 Here's a hand, king, king, king, king, king 
 Bitch, Yelavision and the dirty south 
 And you know we getting green, bitch, eh 
 They should've never ever let you out 
 Going down, 'em all with the mouth from the south 
 What you gonna say, what you gonna do? 
 As you know they're coming, coming after you 
 Watch out for the D-Boys 
 Watch out for the boys in blue 
 You better keep it moving 
 (Big Boy) 
 You know they're taking shots at you 
 'Cause you're an animal, oh 
 Candy coated whip running over candy coated rappers 
 (Vroom) 
 Panties on my drip 
 Do a back flip for me, baby 
 Be an acrobatic actor 
 (Action) 
 Do a cartwheel on the wall, will you? 
 Do a cartwheel while I chill on a bar stool 
 When I throw a dart at a wet seal, well 
 I can see ya well, I'm gonna throw a fucking harpoon 
 Go Looney Tunes and lose ya for the lose 
 To prove you're in a room, you're shrooming to the moon 
 But in the morning you're waking up like a broom 
 Swept off ya feet 'cause Yelawolf ain't a groom 
 I ain't popping the cherry, I'm popping berry 
 Moonshine, hop in the bedroom, let's move 
 If ya wanna compare me, compare me to a legend 
 Don't compare me to a young fool 
 Go get a gun, go get a gun, now get a cinna' bun 
 Now sit upon your fucking roof 
 I live a ton, I get it done, fuck anyone 
 You fuck anybody, you ain't fucking with the crew 
 Yeah, throw another bucket in the pool 
 Dry it out, now everybody skate 
 'Cause I'm a lord of a Doggytown 
 (Woof) 
 A.L.A.B.A.M.A, my state 
 My state of my mind, 1985, wide body 
 Looking for the little small tail gate party 
 Wanna get drunk, wanna fall up in a hottie 
 Get shitty like a porta-potty so 
 Jump on the paddy wagon 
 Like a Pakistani and packing a mack 11 
 With a pack of maniacs, 11:30 back at it again 
 I'm ready for the battle when and where 
 Motherfucker, they let another cracker in, yeah 
 They should've never ever let you out 
 Going down, 'em all with the mouth from the south 
 What you gonna say, what you gonna do? 
 As you know they're coming, coming after you 
 Watch out for the D-Boys 
 Watch out for the boys in blue 
 You better keep it moving 
 (Big Boy) 
 You know they're taking shots at you 
 'Cause you're an animal, oh
