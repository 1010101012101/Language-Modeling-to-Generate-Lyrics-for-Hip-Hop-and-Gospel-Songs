 Go white girl, its ya birthday 
 Yelawolf mane and Gucci 
 Holleratche mane 
 So I got this twelve pack (burr) 
 We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer 
 Wit ya girl in my ear sayin', I just wanna party 
 (Verse 1 - Yelawolf) 
 Trunk music got these poppers poppin' on the Richter scale 
 D boys on the corner droppin' quarters like a wishin well 
 Ziplock in the freezer like yo momma's box of zinfandale 
 Sip it with ya southern bell, bet ya she won't kiss and tell 
 [Inaudible], pack the pack and drink the ale 
 Gettin' drunk, I'm drunk as hell 
 Don't think I can lean my chair 
 Got a tooth brush for the dirty mouth mutha fuckin' rappers 
 You don't wanna see me there 
 Blindside em, blindside em, bitch I'll leave you readin brail 
 You can't Lady Gaga me, don't bother with the poker face 
 I come from the bottom, you ain't gotta put ya dope away 
 Got so many hook ups I could pull the mutha fuckin' train 
 Reachin' for the bottles baby, tell me what you want again 
 I just wanna party [x3] 
 We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer 
 Got ya girl in my ear sayin'

 I just wanna party [x3] 
 We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer 
 Wit ya girl in my ear sayin' 
 I just wanna party 
 (Verse 2 - Gucci Mane) 
 Get wasted, too wasted, so wasted its scary 
 Yellow canaries in my ear, they pretty 
 Lets party like its 1960, I'm the E A Jimmy Hendrix 
 Now the hip imma hippopotamus, I'm roarin up that rinoshorus 
 She's jockin and its obvious, I land in your metropolis 
 Don't know who the baby's father is, but I don't owe no apologies 
 She just want a Harley, I'm rollin' up the Marley, I'm drunk as Paul Mcartney 
 I'm 80 bottles shawty 
 I'm Gucci Mane not pootie tang, I put it down, don't pick it up 
 Advice to you, don't pick on us, Me and Yelawolf got crazy guns 
 We came here with 5 of em, I leave out with 9 of em 
 That's 14, I'm keeping 'em around all morning till I get tired of em 
 I just wanna party [x3] 
 We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer 
 Got ya girl in my ear sayin' 
 I just wanna party 
 I just wanna party [x3] 
 We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer 
 Wit ya girl in my ear sayin' 
 I just wanna party 
 (Verse 3 - Yelawolf) 
 Cocanie on the table wish the rappa got 'em choppin logs 
 Twenty dolla bills all rolled up, Wiz Khalifas rollin' pot 
 Jackie Chan is rollin' rollin', Yelawolf is powin powin 
 Slow motion got hos in motion, I think it's the perfect time 
 To put 'em in the mood, to put 'em in the car 
 Take 'em to the house and (what) 
 Take 'em to the moon, take 'em to the mouth 
 How we do it down south and (what) 
 I'm always going going, 
 Ghettovison is sewing, plowing, growing, growing 
 Crop dusting on the Boeing 
 Catfish Billy, on ya grill (ey) 
 Cook it up, make a meal (ey) 
 Gettin' stupid, gettin' silly 
 Drinkin' beer (ey), also chile 
 Fucked up but I'll tell you that I can't complain 
 Yelawolf and Gucci Mane keepin' yo bitch entertained 
 I just wanna party [x3] 
 We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer 
 Got ya girl in my ear sayin' 
 I just wanna party 
 I just wanna party [x3] 
 We blowin' smoke in the air, drinkin' ice cold beer 
 Wit ya girl in my ear sayin' 
 I just wanna party
