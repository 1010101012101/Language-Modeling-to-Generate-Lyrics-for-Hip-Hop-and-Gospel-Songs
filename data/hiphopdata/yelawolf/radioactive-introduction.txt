 I am 
 I am the American Eagle, eyes of a sparrow 
 Right hand branch, left hand arrow 
 Chasing a dollar, in an Impala 
 White trash heart throb, mellow yellow 
 Drinking hard liquor, brauds get on my level 
 I'm hotter than the bottom side of a whistlin' kettle 
 They threw a mountain at me, I got hit with a pebble 
 Sent me to hell, and I shit on the Devil 
 Try to bury my Chevy box but I won't buckle 
 And that's a deep hole bitch, bring your own shovel 
 Long gone, I'm grown up, and I'm gone cut you 
 With a chrome blade, if you want a play then holmes fuck you 
 Fuck you till you can't take a shit 
 Yeah I'm a fucking a tsunami, better anchor the ship 
 Aim for the ankles and wrist, I came for the dangerous shit 
 I claimed to be named for the hits, the game is a chain that I grip 
 Slang from the pain of a trip it took to see Wayne in the whip 
 I became what I came to get the chains for the chain I give 
 A quarter for your thought, appreciate the contribution 
 Slumerican, I'd appreciate the Constitution 
 Alleviate the crew when, I leave a page in ruins 
 To each is own, I guess I own each and every room in 
 The house I built is full of hopes, no ifs 
 So I stand with a giant like a king, no stilts 
 If I'm Generation X, I'm sellin' Ex, no pills 
 Dopeman chopping up lines you don't sniff 
 Read 'em, I'm bringin' back booklets and hookless, lyrics 
 So you can be certain just in case you didn't hear it 
 But what he says, come again? What is that? 
 Come to Earth, touchdown, I might be your running back 
 Because you hot then run it back, stay cool enough to wear 
 Toboggans as a summer hat 
 Steady on the throne I rap, hope there's no one under that 
 Rock that I roll, mosh pit flow 
 Girls on your shoulders get topless at the show 
 Fuck your mop and glow, can't mop a dirt road 
 It only makes mud, raised around a deer 
 I know how to chase bucks 
 Babysitter, sixteen, taught me how to make fuck 
 At seven, I've been raising hell 
 So I can make it to Heaven 
 Pick up a two-Liter but I only need the plastic 
 I know how to make bombs with aluminum and acid 
 Butterfly effect over hurricane's magic 
 Tornado pathin', rear view mirror of my eighty seven classic 
 I'm talking about Gadsden 
 Look mama no hands, I'm radioactive
