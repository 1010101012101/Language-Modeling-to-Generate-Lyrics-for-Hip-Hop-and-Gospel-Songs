Burn one, burn one 
 Good to go (x4) 
 Fresh kicks, (always) 
 Lou fritz, (all right) 
 Drop hits, (all day) 
 Then party, (all night) 
 (Repeat) 
 (Yelawolf) 
 Walk with a limp but I talk with a lingo 
 Party with a bunch of bad girls in a pinto 
 Run up on a mother fucker wit a dull pencil 
 Sharper than a number 2 on his new Benzo 
 Hit the breaks all the way, you can do an endo 
 Put the bass in yo face, you can feel the tempo 
 Yela's in your face grab a stencil 
 You should wanna get a copy the style 
 Ill lend yo ass, the man's so bad 
 From Alabama with a banjo cocked back 
 Swing bass like a Rambo fix that 
 I don't want to hear shit buddy that's that 
 Can't get a buzz, well run back to the bar 
 Get another drink, get ready to go 
 Send me ya telephone number bitch 
 Maybe when I'm ready to roll ill hitcha with a totem poll 
 But right now I'm 
 (Bun B) 
 Well boy you wanna do shit, let's get to it 
 You already know ima run right through it 
 I'm just like fluid, matter fact like water 
 Come and be real or go lil harder 
 Hide yo girlfriend, wife, or daughter 
 Put 'em on a plate ima serve your order 
 Line 'em up, put 'em in place for the slaughter 
 Game over by the end of the first quarter 
 Wake up hater, rise and shine 
 Ima star boy, you ridin' pine 
 I got your main girl ridin' mine 
 Her face in my lap as I recline 
 Its grindin time as I declare 
 I run my fingers through her hair 
 I run these streets like marathons 
 Ya gangstas be like hammer gone 
 (Yelawolf) 
 Don't you know I got Bun B in my front seat 
 And we got these (choppers on the chrome) 
 One more time for ya boy Pimp C (pockets fulla stones) 
 I gotta pocket fulla stones 'cause I fell off my dirtbike 
 In cargo pants 
 I rock the microphone literally 
 Murder the track lyrically with bottles, cans, 
 Pop a band 
 Put a stack on it I'll water these plants like aqua man 
 Make a rapper run back to the studio 
 Retrace his steps like he dropped a gram 
 I'll be damned, catfish billy 
 You don't wanna run if yo rhythm ain't ready 
 Sin syllables, beats edible, incredible, inevitably, GO!
