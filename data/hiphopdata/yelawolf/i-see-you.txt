Once upon a time not long ago my grandmother told me I'd change 
 I felt like she was coming down on me so I told her no I'd be the same 
 Not knowing she was only trying to help motivate me to excel and climb 
 I was thinking she was the one trapped while I was stuck in a cage of my mind 
 Man if I would've known what I know now 
 I would've brought my head down under the cloud 
 Told her thank you and that I loved her but I was too cool and too damn proud 
 What a fool I was in fact I've changed so much now looking back 
 I wish somebody I thought was cool was as cool as she was when she told me that 
 I see you the real you 
 Trying to cover up what's inside of you 
 But everything you do was make believe 
 Yeah you're hot but you're too cool 
 I see you 
 I see you 
 I see you 
 Baby girl don't know much about what it would take to become a star 
 Hollywood is so far-fetched too long of a drive in an old car 
 Work everyday but you barely eat going over lines from a script you read 
 Your boyfriend says it's a silly dream but how can you dream when you never sleep 
 You looking the mirror and you picturing a light show 
 A glimpse in the lens of a camera behind the scenes of life is a type role 
 Yeah you walk a thin line, but a thin line is all you need 
 A thin line and an indy movie, just to break for somebody to see the 
 Talent inside, the ballad of the diary you write 
 The by and by is just another day for a normal girl but for you it's another day that you try 
 Aside from the fact that you ride on the back of a bus sometimes cause your car won't work 
 But maybe you should take that bus to L.A. and put your dreams first because 
 I see you the real you 
 Trying to cover up what's inside of you 
 But everything you do was make believe 
 Yeah you're hot but you're too cool 
 I see you 
 I see you 
 I see you 
 Black and white, everything is black and white broke down simple and plain 
 Most of us lost with the curious brain 
 Curiosity is looked at as strange 
 Stuck in that lane but you can't complain 
 While you look at another passing train 
 Wondering how, where is it going 
 Wishing you were inside, packed and rolling 
 To another place but your time is chosen 
 To live low key cause your dream is stolen 
 They don't understand, they believe in loathing 
 Lounge and loafing, waiting hoping 
 Homie if the grass is greener; look, the gate is open 
 You waiting for God to release the ocean 
 Sitting on the beach, 2 feet from floating 
 I see you the real you 
 Trying to cover up what's inside of you 
 But everything you do was make believe 
 Yeah you're hot but you're too cool 
 I see you 
 I see you 
 I see you
