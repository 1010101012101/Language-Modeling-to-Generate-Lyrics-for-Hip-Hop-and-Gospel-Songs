Cinnamon seats, dashboard flakes, yeah, sprayed out 
 Drunk as a fool, throwing that Jimmy back until I'm laid out 
 Homie, I'm on my Catfish Billy shit, I'm talking way out 
 Dude, I'm way out - I'm talking way out 
 Rolling country side anywhere that I go, hey now 
 Drunk on 'Quake, cops pulling off they telling me "turn it way down" 
 Homie, I'm on my Catfish Billy shit, I'm talking way out 
 Dude, I'm way out - I'm talking way out 
 Yeah - intergalactic, out of my mind and into traffic 
 In the pepper Converse tryna climb out 
 And risk it with nothing in my backpack 
 It's me: a son of a bitch, a child of a prick 
 A stepson you don't wanna hit 
 Ooh wee, no, not him - not Lil Wayne, Michael Wayans 
 Who you thought it was, B? 
 Damn right, and I'm on a tightrope 
 Screaming out "die bitch", fuck my life 
 I ain't never give a fuck, I could never give a fuck now 
 So put the chain on my bike, yeah 
 Put that bitch back on the spot, give me the pistol before you cock it 
 Let me throw a bullet in the clip for luck for us 
 Poor us, yeah, popping these, shocking, ain't it mane? 
 Well, I guess nobody wants to be broke, right? Black or white 
 Paint the frame 
 'Cause I'm only used to refusing the stereotypes of a name 
 I ain't a name - I'm a soul, I'm a piece of gold 
 I'm a pro, I'm a piece of shit too, too 
 What I gotta do if I gotta roll? Guess what? 
 I'mma roll all over you when I'm riding 
 Used to watch my beeper chirp, new Dickies and a Black (?) shirt 
 My world was a little bitty spot in the universe outside of Earth 
 Tennessee loud, Alabama born, I came down in a meteor storm 
 Media wrong, media right, righting my wrong, lean to get long 
 Don't come to get this, children go - this building is about to blow 
 I don't know what I'mma do with this feeling inside of my mind and soul 
 I'm a one-in-a-million human show 
 Shoulda been the motherfucking Truman Show 
 But if you seen me getting raped as a child 
 You probably wouldn't give me room to grow 
 Heavy blow, take a heavy sigh 
 Like a runner on the dailies, high oh my 
 You'll be good, baby boy, don't cry 
 I can make a boat with the broke up rhymes 
 God made me the Cherokee like no 
 I can't let the world off the hook this time 
 And if you didn't want this catfish shit 
 In fact, you should've never shook that line 
 Readied that hook, took this time, to press play, then rewind 
 I would rather be drunk than be blind 
 To the space age pimp shit that I combine 
 With what I know, rock and roll, I'm so famous, country fresh 
 That I can't take one step in the fuckin' street when I'm in public 
 So I get in this
