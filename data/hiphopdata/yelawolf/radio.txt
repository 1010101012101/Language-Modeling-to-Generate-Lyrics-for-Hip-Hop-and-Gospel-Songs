I can't seem to get you off my mind 
 Turn on the station and I'm still facin' you 
 And everybody seems to lost their mind 
 It's hard to handle so I change the channel on the radio 
 'Cause Internet killed the radio star 
 Radio and YouTube killed the video star 
 Hit the radio then we make a 
 (Make a) 
 Video, now I'm a star 
 Hit the radio then you make a 
 (Make a) 
 Video, now I'm a star 
 Picture me rollin' Pac 
 It's funny how time has changed 
 Everybody's a critic now 
 It's all a debate on the internet wave 
 It used to be you and Biggie 
 Chili Peppers "Give It Away" 
 Now we got 10 year olds 
 Sittin' back in the chair like, "Those were the days" 
 And though it seems so amazin' to me 
 That the labels lost the touch 
 And I'm in the AM flippin' through the AM 
 Like I lost my crutch 
 Limpin' 'cause I can't even walk straight 
 If I can't turn it up 
 Sippin', I need some gin and juice 
 Snoop Dogg, I bought my cup 
 Wassup, uh huh, okay, shut up 
 'Cause I think we had enough of 
 Radio's in lust with the love bugs 
 Well, let me give you a big hug 
 A bag of mushrooms, here take some drugs 
 And play some Group Home or somethin' 
 Shit that Goodie MoB Soulfood is bumpin' 
 Rewind 
 I can't seem to get you off my mind 
 Turn on the station and I'm still facin' you 
 And everybody seems to lost their mind 
 It's hard to handle so I change the channel on the radio 
 'Cause Internet killed the radio star 
 Radio and YouTube killed the video star 
 Hit the radio then we make a

 Video, now I'm a star 
 Hit the radio then you make a

 Yeah, you'll never hear Black Star 
 'Cause the program director's Mos'tly Def 
 And you'll never hear Triple Six 
 'Cause we live in the mist of the Bible belt 
 But that's where the light is felt 
 So let it shine, let 'em rhyme 
 Let 'em hustle, let 'em grind 
 Nothin' wrong with the truth sometimes 
 Sometimes the truth is dark 
 But the darkness sparks the truest art 
 And you didn't even know you had a window 
 'Til the tornado blew it apart 
 If Eric Clapton can sing about cocaine 
 And there's no harm 
 Then I can write about guns I can rap about girls 
 I can sing about money and cars 
 Not that my money is large 
 Let's talk about broke as a joke 
 Let's talk about gettin' evicted 
 Everything you own thrown out on the road 
 And maybe that there goes gold 
 Shit maybe it's platinum sold 
 But they don't wanna see the green rings 
 From the pirates gold 
 No, hold up rewind 
 I can't seem to get you off my mind 
 Turn on the station and I'm still facin' you and 
 Everybody seems to lost their mind 
 It's hard to handle so I change the channel on the radio 
 'Cause Internet killed the radio star

 Pick up the change, pick up the change 
 Ridin' a Chevy 'cause I'm sick of the Range 
 Catfish Billy, come pick up the name 
 Come on inside if you're sick of the rain 
 Turn the radio off and don't complain 
 It's all a replay, it's all the same 
 Got one track on a runaway train 
 On a one way street better pick your lane 
 Yeah but you can let me pick your brain 
 And we could be that rolling stone 
 Mix 'em up with Janice Joplin 
 And let 'em harmonize like Bone 
 Or we can just leave it alone 
 And let it take a life on its own 
 Or we could be that world class wreckin' crew 
 And tell 'em turn the lights back on, come on 
 I can't seem to get you off my mind 
 Turn on the station and I'm still facin' you and 
 Everybody seems to lost their mind 
 It's hard to handle so I change the channel on the radio 
 'Cause Internet killed the radio star 
 Radio and YouTube killed the video star 
 Hit the radio then we make a 
 (Make a) 
 Video, now I'm a star 
 Hit the radio then you make a
