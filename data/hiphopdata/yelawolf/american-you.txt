Man, you got it all worked out, don't you? Old pair of shoes 
 Never wear your heart on your sleeve cause it don't go with the suit 
 You got a bad, bad woman with a young little pretty face 
 They told you not to go get married 
 But you went and did it anyway 
 Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you 
 Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos 
 Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through 
 Fuck you too 
 Mama said steer clear of the devil so you never played in the road 
 Always lookin' on the bright side, so you never see the potholes 
 You got a house on a hill, big news, that's a big deal 
 Big party with your big time friends, man, imagine how that feels 
 Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you 
 Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos 
 Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through 
 Fuck you too 
 I believe in the modest dream, ain't lookin' for a pot of gold 
 A 6 pack and some good marijuana, I can watch my mama roll 
 I believe I can buy a few things like a house with a nice pool 
 Invite my nobody friends to the party and we'll be in it, fuck you 
 You got a blue collar father who drinks Budweiser out the bottle 
 20 dollars, an old Impala, a baby's mama 
 You work hard, you don't beg, you don't borrow 
 Night at the factory, daytime job at McDonald's 
 Your daddy told you that girl was nothin' but a problem 
 But you fell in love cause to you she was like a supermodel 
 And they told you not to go get married 
 But you went and did it anyway 
 It ain't no problem 
 You make somethin' out of nothin', you make money for a livin' 
 Pushin' buttons, stickin' digits, flippin' burgers in the kitchen 
 With the vision, you've been dreamin', you've been savin' 
 You've been given nothin' but shit 
 But you take it 'cause you're patient in this prison 
 Fuck everybody visitin', it ain't them who gotta live in this skin 
 With all these tattoos that you got, it fuckin' offends them 
 If it's you that I'm speakin' to, you must be my extension 
 I take my drink up and sip it, take my hat off and tip it 
 Slumerican 
 Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you 
 Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos 
 Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through 
 Fuck you too 
 Singin', oh sweet sounds of American you 
 Never miss a Sunday service, never got tattoos 
 Every time we drive by wavin', I see right through 
 Fuck you too
