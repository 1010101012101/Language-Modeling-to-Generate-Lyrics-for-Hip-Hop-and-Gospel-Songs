Im on the pavement, thinkin' about the government 
 Santanas in the basement... mixin up the medicine 
 Mixin up the medicine 
 Mixin up the medicine 
 (I'm back) 
 I was in the basement mixin up the medicine 
 Mixin up the medicine 
 Mixin up the medicine 
 I was in the basement mixin up the medicine 
 I get jail... jump bail 
 Get jail... jump bail 
 Get jail... jump bail 
 Join tha army if ya fail 
 Mixin up the medicine 
 Mixin up the medicine 
 I was in the basement mixin up the medicine 
 I get jail... jump bail

 (Yelawolf) 
 Mixin up the medicine 
 Trippin' on the mescaline 
 Moonshine in the bottle 
 Got the brooms swirlin like peppermints 
 Spinnin like a ceiling fan 
 Hotta then I've eva been 
 If you wanna chop it up 
 You need a propeller man 
 Cellaphane, sell a gram 
 Don't sell me the weather man 
 If you wana make it rain 
 Make it rain a better jam 
 Y'all weaker then baby's hands 
 Faker then a renta van 
 Take it back, make a track 
 Then give a pen to yelaman 
 An Ill stomp on that beat 
 Like it's a fight that I'm just jumpin' in 
 The south is gettin' krunk again 
 In 'n' out like I'm punchin in 
 Bitch betta go take lunch again 
 I'm workin with a bomb of confidence 
 Politican and flippin the system 
 Usin' my wristn mixin 
 Mixin up tha medicine 
 Mixin up the medicine 
 I was in the basement mixin up the medicine 
 I get jail... jump bail 
 Get jail... jump bail 
 Get jail... jump bail 
 Join the army if ya fail

 Lights camera action, I'm feelin' fantastic 
 Flyer then a pair of wings flappin 
 Take my picture 
 You a freak, Ima freak 
 You goin' home, take me witcha 
 I look at your baby pictures 
 But I won't have no baby witcha 
 Back up boy ya heard me 
 Back up boy ya heard me 
 I'm ballin like the 80s, Ya I'm so James Worthy 
 Still makin' money off the white girl, Fergie 
 I ain't a new boy so they know they can't jerk me 
 No limit how I get it, call me Percy, 
 Miller Ima killer, no mercey 
 And I'm so dope you'd think Frank Lucas served me 
 So hot fire couldn't burn me 
 Bitches wana nurse me 
 Take her out and trick around 
 I taker her home and dick her down 
 And send her back to you 
 Like baby I was at my sisters house 
 Y'all niggas remember me 
 I'm every rapper enemy 
 'Cause they know once I get the lead 
 You'll neva get a head of me 
 Mixin, mixin, mixin up the medicine 
 Mixin up the medicine 
 I was in the basement mixin up the medicine 
 I get jail... jump bail 
 Get jail... jump bail 
 Get jail... jump bail 
 Join tha army if ya fail

 (Julez Santana) 
 Swagg on rooftops 
 And one's new glock 
 You wana get loud you get blasted-boombox 
 Attitude like Tupac, when Juice dropped 
 Still go to the dealer 
 With the money in a shoe box 
 (Gimme dat) 
 This wasn't posed to come out 
 This wasn't posed to come out 
 They let that new drug out 
 They let that new drug out 
 My niggas bout to dumb out 
 My ladies bout to bug out 
 And if her body crazy ima take her to the nuthouse 
 You lames ain't interestin 
 The games been missin' this 
 You niggas full of suga and I came with the insulin 
 Whatevers you addiction 
 I got the perscription 
 I get it how I'm livin' and I'm lovin' every minute 
 You got that shit that just came out 
 That new new 
 I got that shit that ain't come out 
 It's too new 
 I'm so intruiging, your girl so deceivin 
 I'm so exciting and she so conivin 
 Mixin up the medicine 
 Mixin up the medicine 
 I was in the basement mixin up the medicine 
 I get jail... jump bail 
 Get jail... jump bail 
 Get jail... jump bail 
 Join tha army if ya fail
