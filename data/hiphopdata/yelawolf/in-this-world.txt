It's getting hard to be me 
 Everywhere I go, somebody's looking at me 
 And If I ever need something, I'ma get it for myself 
 'Cause I'm the only person thinking 'bout me 
 It's getting hard to be me 
 Everywhere I go, somebody's looking at me 
 And if you gon' compare me at all best, compare me to myself 
 'Cause I'm the only person fucking with me 
 In this world of sticks, hicks and chicks with Aqua net spray 
 Sh sh shh hh, shut up, motherfucker 
 Don't disrespect these country ways 
 Yeah, Alabama, if yeen know, I ain't hiding a damn thing 
 I just like to lean low, yeah, I'm the theme show 
 Stereotypical beanpole, slim, tall, tatted, let me add 
 That I gotta green glow from all the Mountain Dew that I consume 
 From a mason jar, in a racing, chase it with a tall ice brew 
 Let me not leave you confused, what I represent culturally 
 Trash bag full of Freon, I'm huffin' puffin' on potpourri 
 That gummo's squeaky swingin' gate in front of that trap house 
 Trailer park is sewed up and Billy done pulled that Lac out 
 It's getting hard to be me 
 Everywhere I go, somebody's looking at me 
 And If I ever need something, I'ma get it for myself 
 'Cause I'm the only person thinking 'bout me 
 It's getting hard to be me 
 Everywhere I go, somebody's looking at me 
 And if you gon' compare me at all best, compare me to myself 
 'Cause I'm the only person fucking with me 
 Wonder what I got inside this Chevrolet Trunk I'm hiding 
 About ten bodies on a fishing line with baby clothes on consignment 
 Came to the game so broke that I still find one-dollar bills and get a thrill 
 That's the kind of shit that leaves my pickle dill'd 
 Siding on the single wide got icicle steel, too cold 
 Gotta kerosene heater to heat up the grill, meatloaf? 
 Daddy's in jail again for shuffling pills, we know 
 Man, I've only come to give you a peep show 
 (In this world) 
 I run across the South like a wild stream, smiling 
 I've seen more colorful mushrooms than a child's dream 
 On an island, desolate left behind 'cause my state is a state of crime 
 God said, 1979, go change the minds 
 (In this world) 
 It's getting hard to be me 
 Everywhere I go, somebody's looking at me 
 And If I ever need something, I'ma get it for myself 
 'Cause I'm the only person thinking 'bout me 
 It's getting hard to be me 
 Everywhere I go, somebody's looking at me 
 And if you gon' compare me at all best, compare me to myself 
 'Cause I'm the only person fucking with me 
 Yelawolf, hi, my name is President Obama 
 I'm so shameless, I'm taking it all so what am I saying 
 I'm the voice of every small town 
 (In this world) 
 Like a light and a pipe with a mic and take flight in this life 
 What a sight, put a vice grip lock on my right to fight despite 
 The way you may feel about sights and sounds that I might put down 
 About prices found on a sack of that white heaven is a place in a 7/11 
 I can never get away from hell, found hell in the bible-belt 
 And found love in a 6-pack up on the shelf 
 Went to the seashore to see more but Leroy didn't seem sure to me 
 So I took Leroy to Alabama, he bought the hat and bought the Tee 
 Converted him, y'all, I gave him convertible thoughts 
 When he saw that big buck hangin' on the wall 
 (Yeah) 
 I'm off by a millimeter, I'm on by a million light years 
 And 2 liters a pint of Moonshine, I ride a 2 seater 
 Take a ride in this world
