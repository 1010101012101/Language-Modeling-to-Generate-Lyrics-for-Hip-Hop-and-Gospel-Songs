What, what, what you gonna do? 
 Like leeches suckin on your money for blood 
 To have power, buy all you people's love 
 Don't give a damn how you get it, as long as you get it 
 Never split it, I ain't with it, whatever way you did it 
 Step off! 'Cause I ain't got no time for your kind 
 Leave me the fuck alone, I'm headin in a new state of mind 
 And I'm sick of playin' all your games 
 You stainin my brain and things will never be the same 
 Primal 
 You can't hide long with all your lies 
 And when the truth comes out to stand the test of time 
 And you can wear your mask and you can hide your face 
 You can destroy your past and you can leave no trace 
 So you can change, trying to rearrange fuck stayin the same 
 Cause your brain's what I blame for me going insane 
 Now let it out and try to survive and keep it real 
 Then reveal what you feel with you primal side 
 Don't make me hate you for your lies 
 Don't make me hate you I can't relate to 
 Guess I mistaked you, now I'm gonna hate you 
 I came to grips and realized 
 I realized, now I realized, I realized I can see it in your eyes 
 I can't control my primal side 
 I can't control it, I can't control it, I can't control it, No I can't control it 
 Illusions, tattoos, they won't go away 
 A constant earthquake or continuous play 
 It's all in my mind, I feel so corrupted 
 Now it's time to unwind so I say fuck it 
 For ADD they're pumpin Ritalin in me 
 To help me fit in their society 
 But I won't change, I won't bend, I won't break 
 So take that shit and get the fuck outta my face 
 NOW! 
 Don't make me hate you for your lies 
 Don't make me hate you I can't relate to 
 Guess I mistaked you, now I'm gonna hate you 
 I came to grips and realized 
 I realized, now I realized, I realized I can see it in your eyes 
 I can't control my primal side 
 I can't control it, I can't control it, I can't control it, No I can't control it 
 You can wear you mask, you can hide your face 
 You can destroy your past, you can leave no trace 
 Don't make me hate you for your lies 
 Don't make me hate you I can't relate to 
 Guess I mistaked you, now I'm gonna hate you 
 I came to grips and realized 
 I realized, now I realized, I realized I can see it in your eyes 
 I can't control my primal side 
 I can't control it, I can't control it, I can't control it, No I can't control it
