I know somethings shady when I'm feeling it 
 You play the game like cards when your dealing it 
 I see through the eyes of a marked man 
 But in the streets you gotta have a game plan 
 I'm paranoid I se them coming after me 
 24/7 on me constantly 
 I see the red beam, I walk the tight rope 
 But I know I'm the target in the scope 
 YEA! 
 I try to weed out the real from the fake ones 
 Two faced ones wont you keep it real son 
 I can see it from a mile away 
 'Cause I'm holding it down with my feet on the gound 
 And they... 
 They're tryin' to break me, they're tryin' to rape me 
 They're tryin' to bring me down 
 They're tryin' to break me, they're tryin' to rape me 
 They're tryin' to bring me down 
 I know there's something going on 
 And it seems so cold 
 I know there's something going on 
 And it won't be long 
 I know there's somthing going on 
 How could you be so cold 
 I know there's something going wrong 
 Yeah! 
 Evil lurks when you around 
 And then you know how it's goin' down 
 I look deep and figure how to break free 
 In my pain escape from reality 
 I see you scoping on my life and now he tells me 
 You look suspicious and you plan is tryin' to gank me 
 The mainsuspect but your the reject 
 You'll be the one with the gun, no respect for me 
 I roll deep like a bond, I got a blue print 
 Creep in your area lowright through the residence 
 Like a sniper, control the damager 
 Flippin the script 'cause I'm two steps ahead of ya 
 They're tryin' to break me, they're tryin' to rape me 
 They're tryin' to bring me down 
 I know there's something going on 
 And it seems so cold 
 I know there's something going on 
 And it won't be long 
 I know there's somthing going on 
 How could you be so cold 
 I know there's something going wrong 
 Yeah! 
 I know there's something on 
 I know there's something on 
 Can't get this out of my head 
 I know there's something going on 
 And it seems so cold 
 I know there's something going on 
 And it won't be long 
 I know there's somthing going on 
 How could you be so cold 
 I know there's something going wrong 
 Yeah!
