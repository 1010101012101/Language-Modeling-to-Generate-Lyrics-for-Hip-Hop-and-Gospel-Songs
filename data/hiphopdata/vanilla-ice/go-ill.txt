Get on up... I walk the beat and walk it with clarity 
 I wanna' make sure all's hearin' me 
 Ducks who's bummin', I found your hide away 
 I'm livin' large y'all so by the way 
 Who rocked the crowd and rocks it loud 
 On the strengths, y'all, I'm takin' bows now 
 Kickin' up lyrics that others wanna' rock to 
 Rock like me, y'all this you can't do 
 The V, the A, the N, the I, the LLA y'all 
 It's Vanilla 
 Go Ill, go Ill, get on up, Go Ill, go Ill, get on up, 
 Go Ill, go Ill, get on up, Go Ill, go Ill, get on up, 
 Hold on girl, let your feet move free 
 'Cause you move to the groove of Vanilla I-C-E 
 You come here to rock and let the white boy rap 
 If you a 'ho, get off my lap 
 'Cause Ice stands for bein' so cold 
 That's a nickname I got for bein' so bold 
 Jerome stands for M.P.A. 
 My personal assistant, every day 
 I'm not an MC who come here to play 
 Yo, boy, I'm serious, I'm goin' all the way 
 Rhymes are clean, There's no need to be ill 
 And when I'm on the mic, I let 'em all spill 
 I rock the mic like I'm a fanatic 
 When I see one, I got to have it 
 I'll whip up a sound that'll burst your eardrum 
 What you gonna' do? Don't you play dumb 
 Busy like Kizzy, Groovin' like Rubin 
 Don't care what you do, just keep movin' 
 Shakin' your limbs until they wear thin 
 I make your butt shake just watch the boy grin 
 Simple like Simon, With Ice rhymin' 
 Some MC's fakin' it, But I'm the diamond 
 I'm the rhyme doctor, always on call 
 You watch your fries, boy, or I'm gonna' take yours 
 Start skeezin' and move that hip girl 
 Get in the mood and don't you quit 
 Smooth as slime, King Rhyme 
 Rock it boy, 'cause it's a craime 
 I'll make you scream like you're in between 
 When I'm on the mic, yes I'm the king 
 'Cause I'm hungry as a dog, I'll eat up 
 My rhymes are runnin', don't interrupt 
 'Cause I'm a throne overtaker, Not and MC faker 
 I like my coffee, but I can't stand Sanka
