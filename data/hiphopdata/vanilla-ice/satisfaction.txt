Let it roll! 
 Oh, yeah, remember this one?... 
 Do it Do it Do do do it 
 Saturday night, the club was packed but I can't get no action 
 The girl I want is frontin' hard, I can't get no satisfaction 
 1000 people up in the club and the music's thumpin' hard 
 I must admit that I was slightly anxious to have my card 
 Pulled by a girl in a nice tight dress 
 The kind that makes your body wet, hmm, I must confess 
 I tried her, she said "No" but fellas yo, I can't get no 
 I can't get no, I can't get no 
 (Yeah, ya know what I'm sayin'?) 
 I can't get no, satisfaction, ah, hey, hey, hey 
 (Yep, yep) 
 You know what I say, that's what I say, yeah 
 Girlie at the ball, lookin' mighty fly 
 She looked so fly at the time I had to make up, you know my mind 
 So, I walked up to her gently, just so I can speak 
 Man, she turned around and scoped me down and started doin' the Freak 
 I tried all I could, I even said "Please" 
 She moved my hands off her booty 'cause she was a skeeze 
 Man, I had to escape, so I could get away 
 I told her what was up, she said, "Come back another day" 
 I can't get no, I can't get no 
 (Yeah, ya know what I'm sayin'?) 
 I can't get no, satisfaction, ah, hey, hey, hey 
 (Yep, yep) 
 You know what I say, that's what I say, yeah 
 The party's almost over! The club's about to close! 
 I saw this girl who rocked my world, so I supposed 
 I'll take another chance, a try at romance 
 I couldn't take my eyes off the back of her pants! 
 I moved very smoothly, a nice conversation 
 The perfume she was wearing, ooh, sensation 
 She seemed kinda worried, like something was wrong 
 Tyson at my back, I had to move along 
 I can't get no, I can't get no 
 (Yeah, ya know what I'm sayin'?) 
 I can't get no, satisfaction, ah, hey, hey, hey 
 (Yep, yep) 
 You know what I say, that's what I say, yeah 
 Yo, man, what's up with this? I've got a number-one record! 
 (Earthquake: Yeah and then you get no more records) 
 And I got this body's freak with no tail! 
 (Earthquake: And she has no no onion) 
 She gotz no onion money? 
 (Earthquake: None) 
 None? 
 (Earthquake: None) 
 Nope. She's still make me wanna scratch it and grab it like I wanted it though! 
 I can't get no, I can't get no 
 (Yeah, ya know what I'm sayin'?) 
 I can't get no, satisfaction, ah, hey, hey, hey 
 (Yep, yep) 
 You know what I say, that's what I say, yeah 
 I can't get no, I can't get no 
 (Yeah, ya know what I'm sayin'?) 
 I can't get no, satisfaction, ah, hey, hey, hey 
 (Yep, yep) 
 You know what I say, that's what I say, yeah
