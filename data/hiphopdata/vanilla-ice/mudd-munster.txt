Mudd Monster following me uh 
 It's hard but I really can't see uh 
 He lives inside the trees uh 
 Outside of New Orleans uh 
 He'll eat your flesh like Hannibal 
 Human type animal 
 Oh no he's after me uh 
 Mudd Monster psycho creature 
 Run, Run 
 No Face, no fingerprints to trace 
 Just like it never did take place 
 Bloody master psycho creature 
 Beware of the freak of nature 
 Screams of pain comin' from the mud 
 Streams of rain up the blood 
 Half human half gorilla 
 Saskatchewan, cannibal killa 
 Psycho alien, stuck in my cranium 
 Psycho alien, leave me the fuck alone 
 Psycho alien, stuck in my cranium 
 Psycho alien, leave me the fuck alone 
 Nowhere to run to 
 No one to turn to 
 No one to help you 
 Time has come to die, die, die 
 Return to the dust from whence you came 
 The smell of blood is in the rain 
 And then his pleasure brings you pain 
 Ashes to ashes dust to dust 
 Ashes to ashes dust to dust 
 Ashes to ashes dust to dust 
 Ashes to ashes dust to dust 
 Psycho alien, stuck in my cranium 
 Psycho alien, leave me the fuck alone 
 Psycho alien, stuck in my cranium 
 Psycho alien, leave me the fuck alone
