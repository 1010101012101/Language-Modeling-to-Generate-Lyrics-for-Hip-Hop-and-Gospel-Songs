2 2 2 ICE 
 Yeah 1 2 1 2 mic check uh 
 Death and destruction 
 Weak rhymes and hard crimes 
 Tech nines and lost time to find my 
 Know what it's like to world fight 
 And white lies 
 Dark side with no sides 
 The very light 
 To decide what lies inside the eyes 
 Terrorize despite the pain surprise 
 I won't front you know I won't hide 
 Why? its fright night worldwide 
 It's coming its coming 4x 
 Nothing is real 
 Can't do what you feel 
 Nothing feels right 
 Can't save my life 
 Steady rise and rise to the other side 
 Predefined and unified its redefined 
 Love or hate complicate when we all die 
 Don't lose sight of the struggles that I have inside 
 Find out the reason why the people ask why 
 They see the light I'm going out each and every time 
 Now clear the path I feel the wrath now I'm free 
 Get from in front of me 
 You can't make me die 
 Now I testify 
 Through you I can see 
 Get from in front of me 
 You can't make me die 
 Now I'm detrified 
 Through you I can see 
 Get from in front of me 
 NOW! 
 Nothing is real 
 Can't do what you feel 
 Nothing feels right 
 Can't save my life 
 Nothing is real 4x
