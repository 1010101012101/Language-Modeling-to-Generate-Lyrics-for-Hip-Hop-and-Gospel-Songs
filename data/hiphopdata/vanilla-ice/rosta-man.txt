Strictly from the islands, Vanilla Ice 
 The man jam down reggae music 
 Mash it up Ice, Mash it 
 I got the rhyme to keep the body pumpin' 
 Turn the party out while the people are jumpin' 
 Reggae style at the top of my list 
 Is hitting real hard like Mike Tyson's fist 
 It is so good that the girlies goin' crazy 
 Vanilla's on the mic and you know I'm not lazy 
 I'm pumpin' up the lyrics in a smooth way 
 I drop 'em like a bum rush much as what we say 
 The other MC's try to duplicate 
 But with the Rosta man they just mediate 
 Rosta man you be jammin' so smooth 
 You rockin' on the mic and you can only improve 
 Rosta man you know you sound so sweet 
 I like the way you put the lyrics to the funky beat 
 Ah rae rue, re rae rah 
 Reggae rock has the style to chase the blues away 
 Ah rae rue, re rae rah 
 Reggae rock has the style to chase the blues away 
 Me and I, myself and you 
 The Rosta man, DeShay and the rest of my crew 
 Reggae music's been around for a while 
 Vanilla Ice is doin' it the hip hop style 
 Because this is the one that we call the rae rue 
 Everybody out there you know just what to do 
 Just clap your hands and stomp your feet 
 Move around to the sound of the reggae beat 
 No push, no fall, no shove, no trip 
 The Rosta man wants you get with it 
 Well the people out there let me hear you scream 
 If you want to get down and you want to be seen 
 Then jump up my man, do the Rosta man 
 Move your head up and down to the reggae jam 
 Just shake your arms and move your hips 
 All you females out there let me shake your 
 And just get down like you're makin' love 
 All you people who believe in God above 
 From the ah rae rue, the re rae rah 
 The Jack Tar village in Jamaica 
 Ocho Rios or the way to Kingston 
 If we go back to the homeland again 
 Back on tour from city to city 
 Rollin' with the girls with the big, big ah... 
 Pity the fool who step it to me 
 I drop 'em like a fly, I better get the flea
