Girl, I keep thinking, 
 Of how I feel. 
 When I'm in your arms, 
 Gives me a chill. 
 Just knowin' that you want me 
 By your side 
 Mellows my mind, 
 And enhances my pride. 
 Girl I need you more, 
 And more each day. 
 Believe me when I tell you, 
 I'm here to stay. 
 I'm captured by your love, 
 And your pretty smile, 
 Your devastating beauty, 
 And your sweet profile. 
 I love you 
 'Cause I love you 
 I love you 
 'Cause I Love you 
 You're so fine, 
 Lets wine and dine. 
 I'm so happy, 
 That you are mine. 
 Thinking of you, 
 I melt with desire. 
 Take you in my arms, 
 Let love take us higher. 
 To hear you talk, 
 Sounds so sweet. 
 When you're close to me, 
 I feel your heat. 
 Girl I want you, 
 And you want me, 
 And it'll last 
 Until eternity. 
 You're like the snow, 
 Falling from the sky, 
 So clean, 
 Like the look in your eye. 
 You're my queen, 
 I'll buy you everything. 
 Yes, girl, 
 Even diamond rings. 
 'Cause you're my lady, 
 And this love is true. 
 Every sunset, 
 Makes me think of you. 
 And I'll never forget, 
 What you mean to me, 
 Comin' straight from the heart 
 Of Vanilla I-C-E. 
 I love you 
 'Cause I love you 
 I love you 
 'Cause I Love you

 Hello? 
 Girl, when I first saw you, 
 It was love at first sight. 
 We've been going out now 
 For about two years, 
 And I still feel the same. 
 I know I haven't said it much before, 
 Well, see, it's because I get all choked up inside. 
 Just doesn't want to come out. 
 I don't know... 
 Maybe this'll help for all the bad things I've done... 
 So, don't matter what goes on, 
 No matter what happens, 
 Just always remember... 
 I love you...
