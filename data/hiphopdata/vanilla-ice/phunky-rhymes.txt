I draw my rhymes like a bow 
 Shoot 'em out like an arrow. 
 Swoopin' on suckers like an eagle not a sparrow 
 I'm walkin' a wide path. 
 I never ever walk it narrow 
 Steppin' on stage with funky hip hop apparel. 
 I got the funky rhymes 
 Sometimes they leave ya scared bro. 
 It's like lookin' down a shotgun barrel 
 Pump up the sounds to the max. 
 As if ya dare yo, My groove is dope 
 An' I hope that you're prepared so, 
 Give it up Smooth 'cause the ICE is got it sewed up 
 The bum rush is on, an' Vanills'a gonna blow up 
 Dead in your grill - Loc. 
 I'm kickin' it real fly - Hops 
 This is how it's done homies, 
 An' ya know I got funky rhymes. 
 I got the rhymes that's pumpin' 
 Keeps the jeeps bumpin' 
 Sounds that's thumpin' 
 Women wanna jump in 
 I ride down many streets 
 Rockin' all the big beats 
 My albums's on the top 
 With a bullet for many weeks 
 This is how it's done - see 
 Doin' it for my fnas G 
 Doin' it for Dallas an' everybody in Miami 
 Thought I was down with Luke 
 No but here's the scoop 
 You make all your loot - 
 But ya can't even pay your group 
 Well man that's straight wacked! 
 In fact, I hate that 
 Watch yourself 'cause ya might get paid back 
 All this funky dope stuff 
 I'm kickin' it real fly - Hops 
 This is how it's done homies 
 An' ya know I got funky rhymes
