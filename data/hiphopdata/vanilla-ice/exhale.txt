Exhale, Exhale, Exhale, Exhale 
 Droppin' science in you ear like my name was Einstein 
 I been breakin down these barriers in this concubine 
 I'm trapped in the ice and there's no escape 
 I bet you'll regret everyday, that you got up pin my face 
 With eye contacted and the domes will crack 
 Anywhere, anytime, on any world map 
 You jibber-jabber bullshit 
 Flapper, wanna-be rapper 
 Fake mini-me like who? 
 Marshall Mathers 
 Walkin' a fine line, stompin in prime time 
 Strippin down your neck 
 Now you're living in the die time 
 Don't hold back, I don't take jack 
 My shit is tabu like my sisters ass crack 
 Call the FBI to secure this operation 
 Ice is penetrating all across this damn nation 
 A diabolical philosophy, I'm breathing 
 Micrphone phenon, you eatin my semen 
 You got phobia, get off my sisters lobia 
 Trailer park trash, get off my ball sack 
 Comin' through with the wickedness 
 Yo, I'm true to kickin this 
 Try to stop me, HAH don't be ridiculous 
 Exhale, Exhale, Exhale, Exhale 
 Walkin' a fine line, stompin in prime time 
 Strippin down your neck 
 Now you're living in the die time 
 Don't hold back, I don't take jack 
 My shit is tabu like my sisters ass crack
