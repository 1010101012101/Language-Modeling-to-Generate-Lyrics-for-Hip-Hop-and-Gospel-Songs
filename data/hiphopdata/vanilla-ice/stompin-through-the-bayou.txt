Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy 
 Keepin' it holy means no snatching purses on Sunday 
 I got what you want and everything you need 
 Come and follow me through this society 
 Hear me holler and scream until your ears bleed 
 See me comin' at you I know you fear me 
 Stomp! stomp! 
 Stompin through the bayou (x4) 
 Fuck all the bullshit I don't give a fuck 
 {???} 
 I can see your scemes you false prophets 
 Fuck the American dream my shit is toxic 
 I spit more venom than you leave you in boxes 
 Stompin through the bayou no one can stop this 
 Stomp! stomp! 
 Stompin through the bayou (x4) 
 Do it how I do it 
 Flowin like fluid 
 Blew up the nine deuce and I'm still true to it 
 Are you stupid 
 And I mean thought they could stop me 
 Enemy is sloppy 
 So I came back like Rocky Balboa 
 I'll show you how it really goes down 
 Takin' 12 rounds 
 Turn it into a Ghost Town 
 Hell bound 
 Here comes a hell hound for your heart 
 I rip you apart don't get caught after dark 
 'Cause I... 
 Stomp! stomp! 
 With my big black boots on! (x2) 
 Stomp! stomp! 
 Stompin through the Bayou 
 Stomp! stomp! 
 I got what you want and every thing you need 
 Come and follow me through this society 
 Hear me holler and scream until your ears bleed 
 See me stompin at you I know you fear me (x2) 
 Stomp! stomp! 
 Stompin through the Bayou (x4)
