"Freestylevanilla ice 
 Freestylin on the mic get in the go 
 Freestylin on the mic so let if flow 
 Freestylin on the mic get in the go 
 First on the microphonepsycho 
 Taking rappers like hot dice, like hot nights in vegas 
 Got says they hate us 'cause they are f*****g with the greatest 
 Ni@@ers that pull gats and steal gats just like potatoes 
 Knowing they couldn't break us or take us now fake us take us out - no doubt 
 Make us serve your ass with a teck 
 Making rappers bow down like the westside connect 
 I want the ice like cube, so I blast with the mac 10 
 But trust me, I'm throwing up the dub just like dub c 
 Plus we f***s it up on both coasts 
 Don't show clouts when I rip shot, putt ni@@ers in zip lock 
 F*****g with this hip hop fanatics still automatic 
 Yes I smoke kryptonite, get it right, my s^^t is tight 
 Got wicked ways like mr. mike 
 Get the gauge in the night these ni@@ers running loose, get the bodies 
 These ni@@ers in khakis and not versace 
 Somebody should have told you, son it's on like that 
 With the ice man bitch and I am gone like that 
 Freestylin on the mic get in the go 
 Freestylin on the mic so let it flow 
 Freestylin on the mic get in the go 
 And next on the microphone c-note 
 I got some bidnezthat I gotta handle 
 S^^t is kinda risky but I'm gonna have to take the gamble 
 Ni@@ers they trying to plot a scheme on me 
 Double and triple teams on me 
 I'll make them bleed for me 
 And that's how it is going down 
 I won't be satisfied until I see that ass six feet underground 
 Cause you f****d around and pissed the wrong brother off 
 You lied to yourself when you said I was soft 
 Now that's a no no, with manhole I'll formulate a plan yo 
 That will make your children bastards and your wife a widow 
 Trying to battle me that's a sin 
 And be like toni braxton and you'll never breath again 
 'Cause I hit hard like thunder, straight from the under 
 Ground with the sound that will make stevie wonder 
 Hard, but let me continue 
 Serving MC's like lettuce on the menu 
 Pound for pound up in this game to be the best 
 Back the fuck up off me motherfucker 'cause I'm stressed 
 You'll wind up in a casket f*****g with me 
 You get your ass kicked - hit you harder than an accident 
 Let's get down to pleasure 
 And beat the kid out the treasure 
 Let me measure this here joint cause it'll be nothing lesser 
 I'll bet'cha that I'll get it wide open like hostetler 
 Vanilla kobe surround all of you like kobe 
 And leave you in suspense like who done that 
 You checked with grandma 
 I'll be the last man standing off lyrical stamina 
 I round up 100 MC's in one city 
 Knock off 99 and a half 
 And that leaves a half that wanna face me 
 I'll leave him face down in the dirt 
 Call the paramedics check the body for surgery with anesthetic 
 Total mass in a mass stocker, hit the creator 
 Set it off like michael meyers in a double feature 
 Feature funky rhymes that are hard to swallow 
 Send your ass until tomorrow, you'll be hoping to escape the horror 
 Now pay attention to today's lesson 
 And in for your possession 
 Recognize these freestyle confession 
 I'll step aside a case like kojak giving up the evidence but I leave no 
 Fingerprints 
 Yo put the scrip off in a case like mattlock 
 Come bumpin on your block 
 And clean your ass up like dr. spock 
 Freestylin on the mic get in the go 
 Freestylin on the mic so let it flow 
 Freestylin on the mic get in the go 
 And next on the mic it's the ice, so let it flow! 
 It's the incredible party rocker, the heart stopper, hit dropper 
 Hypnotize you all like big poppa 
 Getting everybody blazed with the funky don't stop 
 As I detonate the spot like oklahoma on your block 
 Like it will be the day that I don't blow up any buildings 
 When you hear me boy gonna beat the microphone I'm killing 
 Registering 10 on the richter when I shake it 
 With the earthquake based my taste blowing out your woofers 
 Put you in a state of shock like mick and mike so get it right 
 Making is the night 
 Just to let you know my click is tight, right 
 We got women up front shaking ass 
 Just about stripping want to put on the glass 
 Pass the phat philly as I heat it up like chili 
 Put down the gun son, there is no need for the 9 milli 
 Got the meat for the barbecue so spark a few hops 
 Watch as I raid your spot like spartan infatruate your whole block
