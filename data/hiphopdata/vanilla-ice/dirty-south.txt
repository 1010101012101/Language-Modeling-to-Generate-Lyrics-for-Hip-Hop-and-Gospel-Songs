 Pull the fishin' poles out sippin' on Sizzers

 Rollin' through the hood gotta get my buzz on 
 Hittin' them switches on that 20 inch chrome 
 Through the south side where they got them fat sacks 
 Where they at where they atgot my seat laid back

 Riding on dubs swervin' in the Escalade 
 And these south side niggas, I don't think you could fade 
 Who wanna be the next punk riding in the trunk 
 Ridin' with my nigga Ice blowin' on the skunk

 Comin' with hollow tips up in the clip will make you flip 
 Boy I thought you knew it's south side till I expire
