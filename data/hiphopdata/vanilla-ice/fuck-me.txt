As I continue the journey to get your eardrums straight 
 Now pay attention to this flow, there's no reason to hate 
 Now watch me show your state, and let me state how I do it 
 Sit back and just listen to the music 
 You get sucked up in this melody 
 Hell'll be the ones that lay down and get caught up in their jealousy 
 (Huh) they're telling white lies now realize I caught it from the top 
 And I can see it in your eyes 
 You're the fool in the suit 
 You're the fool in the suit 
 You're the fool, you're the fool 
 You're the fool 
 F_ck you - there ain't nothing you can do 
 You whack bastard - and there ain³g nothing you can do 
 F_ck you - there ain³g nothing you can do 
 You whack bastard - nothing you can do 
 Like a phony acting like that you was my homey 
 Like genuine you tried to ride me like a pony 
 I'm the only that's gonna shine, so forget it 
 You critics who wasn't with it 
 Mad 'cause I flipped it back on ya' 
 Blowin' up the spot like kazinsky on safety 
 Blaze another track cause i³' simply hot to trot 
 Gotta make a knot, get the people into it 
 When I do it, grab the cash, and shake the spot 
 Now tell me if you know how I'm coming, nose running 
 To get a glimpse at the most stunning and cunning 
 And never will I change a format and now you know 
 I can't go for that 
 You're the fool in the suit 
 You're the fool in the suit 
 You're the fool, you're the fool 
 F_ck you - there ain't nothing you can do 
 You whack bastard - and there ain't nothing you can do 
 Fuck you - there ain't nothing you can do 
 You whack bastard - nothing you can do 
 F_ck that bullsh_t... you f_cking... that sh_t sucks... you weak bastard... 
 F_ck vanilla ice... he sucks... he eats sh_t... f_ck vanilla ice 
 (Yelling) I hope you got more sh_t than that you weak motherf_cker! 
 And there ain't nothing you can do 
 And there ain't nothing you can do 
 One short life and I can't die 
 Some got more pricks than a motherf_ckin porcupine 
 Still I'm waiting, waiting to die 
 'Cause I burn like your mother says, boil like your father's pride 
 You're the fool in the suit 
 You're the fool in the suit 
 You're the fool, you're the fool 
 You're the fool 
 F_ck you - there ain't nothing you can do 
 You whack bastard - and there ain't nothing you can do 
 F_ck you - there ain't nothing you can do 
 You whack bastard - nothing you can do 
 F_ck you... you white a**...bullsh_t... corn-fed trailer park... bi_ch... 
 F_cking... f_ck you... cheap, worn out... yuppie... bastard... whack a**... 
 Ice ice baby, ice ice biaaaatch! 
 Ha ha ha
