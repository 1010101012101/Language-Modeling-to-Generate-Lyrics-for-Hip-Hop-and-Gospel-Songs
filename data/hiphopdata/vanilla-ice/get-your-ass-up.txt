Check the resume y'all know me the club rocker 
 Quick to rob a bobber and I fly like a copper 
 I'm livin' well and I dodge all Coppers 
 I move all the ladies but they gotta be proper 
 Sucker free my whole click is so damn tight 
 Guaranteed to make 'em jump 
 When I'm blessin' the mic 
 I got 'em runnin' to the floor they like who dat who dat 
 Droppin' bombs in the club they say do dat do dat 
 I'm coming through with the new school like uh oh 
 Dance floor packed y'all are like here we go 
 The whole club in the mix y'all are movin 
 Bobbin your head while the ladies are smoothin 
 If your game is tight then I know you goin' 
 Jump 
 If your money is right then I know you're goin' 
 Jump 
 If hittin' tonight then you might as well 
 Jump 
 Come on 
 Get yo ass up! 
 And when it gets too hot now what do you need 
 ICE 
 Platinum status who is he 
 ICE 
 Who can rock a show but won't freeze 
 ICE 
 Get yo ass up! 
 All right stop now let the beat drop 
 You know it's hot now let's reach for the top 
 You got the hip then I hit you with the hop 
 Millennium funk I got this game on lock 
 I take four MCs put 'em all in a line 
 Four wannabes who think they can rhyme 
 And five more before I go for mine 
 Now that's 13 ate up at the same time 
 So think realistically not egotistically 
 It's suicide if you even think of dissin' me 
 I'm on a world tour while you're sittin' at home 
 I've been 17 platinum with this microphone 
 If your game is tight then I know you goin' 
 Jump 
 If your money is right then I know you're goin' 
 Jump 
 If hittin' tonight then you might as well 
 Jump 
 Come on 
 Get yo ass up! 
 And when it gets too hot now what do you need

 Muevelo-muevelo Mami, muevelo asi 
 Oyes hasle caso a tu Sugar Daddy 
 Pearla bustin' out treat for my Papis 
 Chillin' with Ice, Latina flava better than xtasy 
 I'm gettin' stupid drunk till the early mornin' 
 You's tappin' dat ass till the break of dawnin' 
 Light the blunts up 
 Tear da club up 
 Drink the fuck up 
 Got a problem you can get the fuck out 
 It's a Friday night playa 
 Time to spend that skrilla 
 Time to spark the killa and chug the Tequila 
 Get your body goin' 'cause the music is flowin' 
 Got ladies shakin' their ass 
 Wearing shit that got their cheeks showin' and bouncin' 
 1 to the 2 to the 3 to the 4 
 25 fellas tryin' to bust down my door 
 What do they want tryin' to live la vida loca 
 With this fly Latina chick who got the bangin' ass chocha. 
 If your game is tight then I know you goin'
