Here comes the lyrical breakdown 
 Move out the way punk and take a seat clown 
 It's the Ice Man slicin', dicin' 
 Hittin' like Tyson 
 So listen to the rhythm I givin' em 
 My lyrics got the impact of a Mac truck 
 When I'm sendin 'em 
 Yo, my funky rhymes flow 
 Kickin it like psycho 
 And I'm exploding like nitro-glis 
 Coming like a hurricane bliss 
 Straight sacking the track like a quarterback 
 My man Zero is back with a killer slice 
 I'm blowin' up the mic 
 Ya damn right, Vanilla Ice 
 With twice the punch 
 I put the crunch on Marky 
 And take the funky out of his bunch 
 I hit the home run 
 You got to third base, son 
 I'm in first place 
 Take a seat clown for the beatdown 
 Uh, tonight's the night of the big fight 
 With the mic in my hand I got the grip tights 
 Ready to swing it like a Louisville slugger 
 Right at the head of a sucka 
 Crack home run 
 How did it feel to have the mic hit ya dome, son? Uh! 
 I tried to make your head ring like a church bell 
 I put it on ya hard 
 I'll make ya hurt well 
 'Cause you fell into my booby traps 
 No more good vibrations 
 I'm tired of your boots raps 
 So I eat ya like scooby snacks 
 And maybe roll you like a zig zag 
 Or smoke you like a hootie mac 
 You did what I did 
 So you're gonna lose kid 
 'Cause to me you're still a new kid on the block 
 Get off my jock 
 Get off my diznok 
 Before you get dropped 
 For the beatdown 
 Yeah, this is the last verse 
 Should I say the last round 
 And it's time I knock out another class clown 
 Sit down and take notes 
 As Vanilla kicks ballistics with dope lyrics 
 Oh what a pity, though 
 'Cause ya had to spend three million dollars on your video 
 It was a good video and I can admit that 
 All that money's wasted 'cause your songs wacked 
 I make stuff to make the people gather 
 And let 'em see us in a pit 
 I wanna slam dance with ya Hammer 
 Now can I kick it, of course I can 
 Yo, you will get burned out, then turned out 
 I'm gonna keep comin' strong, song after song 
 Ya thought I'd fade, well ya dead wrong 
 I'm the imperial threat for this sound fools 
 Ha ha, here comes the lyrical beatdown
