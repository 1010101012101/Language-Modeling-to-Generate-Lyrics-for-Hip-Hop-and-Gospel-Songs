Something is taking over 
 My brain is like a motor 
 Release me from these binds 
 Help me free my mind 
 Everyone's so disguised 
 Can't find truth in their eyes 
 Living this masquerade 
 Everyone's so afraid 
 To die is all we got 
 6 feet down our bodies rot 
 As our souls get released 
 Next our carcass lays deceased 
 Can't get it outta my head--8x 
 This is vituality 
 Someone Explain to me 
 I keep on seeing illusions 
 Of living institutions 
 To die is all we got 
 6 feet down our bodies rot 
 As our souls get released 
 Next our carcass lays deceased 
 Can't get it outta my head--8x 
 Don't wake me I'm feelin' fine 
 I'm outta here in another time 
 I'm more alive even after I'm dead 
 Remember me with every breath 
 I am a holy soldier 
 I am a holy soldier 
 I am a holy soldier 
 I am a holy soldier
