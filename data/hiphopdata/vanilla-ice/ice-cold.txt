Your bad self... 
 All right, stop, spread yourself around 
 Get loose girl, let's break it down 
 Get down, straight to the floor 
 Get excited and beg for more 
 As I go on, flow on with a smile 
 Pay attention to my style 
 Dirty but hot, ya' know what I mean? 
 Get loose girl like a sex fiend, Let's do it 
 'Cause you know what I want 
 Me and you babe go one on one 
 Get freaky and I do the same 
 Get hot and I ride like a sex machine 
 Ice cool and you're colder than ever, I like it 
 Ice cool and you're colder than ever 
 Ice cold, cooler than ever 
 Never say never 'cause I'm so damn clever 
 Lickin' your lips, I'm ridin' your hips 
 V.I.P. posse and we're pimps 
 Be on the lookout in your vicinity 
 I'm robbin' virgins of their virginity 
 Like Robin Hood gave to the poor 
 I rock Kashla and now she wants more 
 She calls everday, it's gettin' kinda' silly 
 But she rides my saddle like Bronco Billy 
 In a rodeo somewhere out west 
 She screams out "Vanilla Ice, you're the best!" 
 Echoing out, can you hear? 
 She screams out everywhere 
 Just a pimp and you know 
 Snatchin' women, so, Yo! 
 You can beg, plead and tell me you love me 
 But there's no way I'd put a girl above me 
 Unless it's sex and you wanna' ride 
 Jump on my saddle, baby, and get live 
 Move your body all around 
 This is the dope jam, so get down 
 Now that you like what I'm sayin' admit it 
 This is the jam and Vanilla just did it 
 I made you work till your butt got sore 
 In other words, I'm about to get raw 
 On stage, it's a V.I.P., Doin' dances from A to ZPumpin' it, pushin' it, stick it hard 
 I freaked your girl in the back of your car 
 I wore a Jimmy that I slapped on 
 Popped a rubber duckie, so bought me a Trojan 
 Get ready, hyped into the groove 
 As I practiced to make your body move 
 You're fienin' for a meanin', oh yes, I'm comin' 
 Vanilla Ice is here so you suckers start runnin' 
 This is the jam I know you're gonna like 
 DeShay he cuts like a knife 
 He won't smirk and he won't smile 
 DeShay get Funky for a while 
 Yo, it's time for me to pump, pump... 
 Pump up the volume
