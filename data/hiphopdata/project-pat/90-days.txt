 Smokin', lotta niggaz out here clean so you know I'm scopin.i ain't wit that 
 Scuffin shit, or wit being broken, waitin for a sucka to stick, yeah that's what

 Liquor wit that blowface on that cokin, bullets they will burn just like lava 
 That is molten, you victims will learn to resist'll get ya croakin.always kept a 
 Thang and bandana never knowin', when I have ta git my mayne, pull 'em out and poke 
 Em, all up in ya grill ya drops it off, 'cause I have spoken, I know that your 
 Sick, but lets not git ya momma mopein, snatched him out tha car hit tha gas dawg

 Shit) bogus tags and a bench warrant (that ain't shit) police all at my mommas

 The stang, and that's to far bet, nigga hit up fred for some rims, he said 
 Whatcha like, sold 'em to our nigga bigga mayne out at mitchell heights, made tha 
 Quicky change then we went and bought a pound pound, straight ta gangstaz house 
 With no remorse we broke it down down,20 dollar bags all in north memphis serve 
 Em up, ridin' wit these bogus tags, mayne we ain't givin' a fuck, map core on chelsea 
 Ave seen tha sucka that we got, we done sold a bag to his patna now he lookin' 
 Hot, raisin up a pistol dawg and nigga started blastin, I returned tha favor, 
 You know me no questions askin, donuts in tha lot tha niggaz pulled off we got 
 Blocked in, I hopped out tha car seen tha police and threw the glock in... to the 
 Garbage can, they did'nt see me but they caught a nigga wit them three bags 
 Gangsta fred wit his steel trigga,
