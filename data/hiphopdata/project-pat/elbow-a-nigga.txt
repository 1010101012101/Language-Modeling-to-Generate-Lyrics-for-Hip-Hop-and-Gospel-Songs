Chorus (2x)-all 
 I bet you won't 
 Elbow a nigga, elbow a nigga 
 Elbow a nigga, elbow a nigga 
 I bet you won't 
 Stomp motherfucker stomp 
 Motherfucker stomp 
 Stomp motherfucker stomp 
 Motherfucker stomp 
 {Juicy j} 
 Hurt nigga 
 I'm coming out the fucking closet 
 Stay the fuck up off my dick 
 I feel the bucking poppin', poppin' 
 Boy I ain't a hoe 
 'Cause I caught you bitches liquor store 
 Niggas that need somthing in yo' ? ? ? 
 Punk yo' nuts broke studio 
 Gangsta step up to the fucking wheel 
 Call you nigga, call yo' click 
 And please tell them shoot to kill 
 Wishing that you would pop yo' nuts 
 'Cause I'm throwing them thangs 
 Take care of your business bitch 
 Now we'll see who run your game 
 Hoe 
 {DJ paul} 
 These niggas all in my face 
 My face these niggas be yening 
 I'm mixing screwdrivers wit' j 
 But don't forget the gining 
 And then I go show my rings 
 And my fake gold chain 
 (Edit) grab the nine like I'm off soul train 
 But I wait 
 Let them haters move first 
 Hundred more bustas I'll make 
 Befor I finish a verse 
 Verses getting crucial 
 Crucial verses getting 
 Cases be spinning 
 Niggas hittin' but I'm hittin' 
 ? ? ? ? ? ? 
 {Lord infamous} 
 Hurts in have minded 
 And you've been blinded 
 By ? and you can find it 
 Hurt your whole faculty 
 Invert your reality 
 Task force, swat team 
 Martials are after me blay 
 Trail of blood drips 
 Stiffs in the fortress 
 Had to blast his organs 
 Took all his fortunes 
 Importing weapons 
 Put it on my beltings 
 Welp in your skeleton 
 Like a wicked witch 
 ? ? ? ? See them bail 
 {Project pat} 
 Be the next nigga to fall 
 Wit' these mags and these techs 
 I be the next nigga to ball 
 In your shift, flip the script 
 See another chapter has been 
 Written in this game 
 Project pat is the pastor 
 Mane I'm after lucci, lucci 
 Like a dicken in a jumpsuit 
 With these infabeam eyes 
 Scooping out a bitch's purse 
 I dispearse killer lyrics 
 Like a tome in ya mug 
 Hypnotize monds gotta 
 Nigga high on some drugs
