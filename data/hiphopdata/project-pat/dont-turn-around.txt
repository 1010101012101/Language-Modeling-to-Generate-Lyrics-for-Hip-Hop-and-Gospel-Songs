I only fuck wit those, who only fuck wit me 
 A sucka' play for games, a man play for keeps 
 I keeps me a nine millimeter just in case 
 A coward's in my face 
 These bullets he gon taste 
 A waste of your life, steppin' wrong, I'm on trees 
 Best ta leave me alone, best ta go make some cheese 
 Enemies come in all shapes, forms, sizes, colors 
 Could be your best friend, cousin, or brothers 
 I'll rob'em all, just to see who got the fatty stack 
 Walked in the bank, put the loot in the codauh sack 
 Slapped on the guard four times fo' he passed out 
 Eyes on that blow and my pockets was assed out 
 Had on a trench coat, wig and some goggles 
 If'n you resist, you may not see tomorrow 
 I'm in there, I den dared the police couldn't get me 
 But I made a slip up: had a trick wit me. 
 Don't turn around (Give me the fuckin' cheese trick) 
 Don't make a sound (Show me where them keys at) 
 Lay it on the ground (knowing that your pockets fat) 
 Fore' I buck you down (and I'm quicks' to do that) 
 Nigga starting braggin' in his hood 'bout the robbery 
 Wasn't long then, fore' somebody dropped the dime on me 
 I'm'a be the one they can't get to, they picked the boy up 
 Run his mouth just like a fool, he gon' get me fucked up 
 But, I'm'a have to get to him before the police do-a 
 Caught up with him night and day, not him and his crew-a 
 Sprang down Chelsie Ave. kinda in the evening 
 For this muhf**kas death, dawg I was fiend'n 
 He was looking at me strange, like I'm'a catcha 
 I done hopped out with the thang, lemme holla at'cha, 
 Foo, where you been dog? (My momma got sick, main!) 
 Fuck that got to do wit'chu? (Hold up I ain't your bitch, main!) 
 I heard you been talking your muh-fuckin' lips loose (Nah, it ain't like that dawg, I ain't no damn fool) 
 Looking in his eyes, I could see that he was so scared 
 I squeezed on the trigga with the gun to his fo'-head. 
 Blew the top out his skull, now they want me dead 
 All the niggas in his hood, police and the feds 
 Stepped out of Westwood, way out of the side 
 On the other side of town, somewhere I can hide 
 I done threw my life away, hunted by them by pigs 
 Robbing every other day, drops in off my nig 
 They done found my whereabouts, bouts' to do me in 
 Kickin' in the front door, and I was in the den 
 SK was under the couch, snatch it off the wham 
 Open fire on them hoes, I didn't give a damn 
 Blood stream was full of dope, pump off coca leaf 
 Feds had me under a scope, and an infrared beam 
 Rifle bullet threw my throat, chokin', hit tha flo' 
 Gunpowder in my mouth, knockin' heavens door 
 Street life done took me out, and that shit ain't fake 
 I done fuck myself off, cause a bad mistake
