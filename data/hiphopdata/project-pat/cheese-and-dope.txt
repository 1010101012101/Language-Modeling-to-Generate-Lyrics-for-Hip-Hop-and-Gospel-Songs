(Project Pat) 
 Out here slanging on this blade praying that I don't get cut 
 By these police making raids, jumping out chicken nutz 
 Cutting ball, down to none, got this weed is in my lungs 
 Nigga's stick me for a bag, I'ma shoot 'em in his ass 
 I'ma show 'em who the boss, when you niggaz gonna learn 
 When you cross in this game, then yo ass will get burned 
 When my turn? or my time? rock a what, for a dime 
 Takin' fair chance after chance, but I got to dance 
 Take the rules of this shit, that's why I keep a revolver 
 I've been heard you're robbers, don't want no other robbers boy 
 I done and scald ya, with pistol slapped cross mouth 
 Reach in niggaz pockets, and take yo money out 
 When you know what's goin', you got cheese, I got dope 
 For da 900th stone, I got peas, I got coke 
 Ain't no credit give mang you could get from round here 
 Niggas robbing, niggas banging niggas slangin' down here 
 I got cheeeese, hoez, and a bunch of fucking dope 
 I got peeeeeas, coke, and some killaz at da doo' 
 Hyyydro weed smoke, and a quarter ounce of dough 
 What yoooouuuu need brah, is to fuck wit yo boy 
 (Project Pat) 
 Quarter bird, what's the word? for you dawgs is da low 
 Selling weed and this weed, but you won't complain a stoo' 
 I'ma go, I'ma pull, leave a rabbit out a hat 
 On some cane, mr.sugar, and some killaz strapped wit gats 
 Always trying to be slick, you done stepped in some shit 
 You done broke ghetto laws, you could tote a fuckin' jaws 
 Nigga boy, he ain't know, 'cause da street never minds 
 Walk right up on yo ass, shoot you, right between the eyes, 
 You be stinkin' wit the flies 
 Walking around on chrome, wit yo bitch, smokin' dro 
 Fucking all in yo home, while she kissing on ma lips, 
 She be sucking on ma dick, grip the glock - sixteen booms as I dip 
 Through the streets of da hood, north memphis Hollywood 
 Represent it, to da max, out this out of state facts 
 Trying to stack me some pape's, got my foot on you snakes 
 Trying to squeeze, hustle-in, for you niggaz that I fade 
 I got cheeeese, hoez, and a bunch of fucking dope 
 I got peeeeeas, coke, and some killaz at da doo' 
 Hyyydro weed smoke, and a quarter ounce of dough 
 What yoooouuuu need brah, is to fuck wit yo boy 
 You could duck from the tech, out da escalade 
 Once I get my cheese, or my flow, then I must be paid 
 If you want to come against me dawg, bring your whole brigade 
 Get you suckaz sliced, like a dog, with a swisher blade 
 Sippin' on some pauly vision, like some sweet kool-aid 
 Strapped with me, an automatic gun, don't you violate 
 Niggaz ain't gonna snitch on me dawg, I didn't hesitate 
 Caught him, at the projects one day, sent him, to his grave 
 Playaz wanna come through the hood, but they got the fear 
 Knowing it ain't all to the good, you could get it here 
 Wrong place, at the wrong time, calling "sip" let's go 
 Wope fiends, keep me on the map, and my pockets full 
 Eyes red ass hell, 'cause I ain't had a blink of sleep 
 Snorted a quarter ball, so that U, could stay on my feet 
 Trick's in this bitch, just as same as a nigga too 
 If you trusting hoes in this game, you'se a dammn fool... 
 (Chorus till end) 
 I got cheeeese, hoez, and a bunch of fucking dope 
 I got peeeeeas, coke, and some killaz at da doo' 
 Hyyydro weed smoke, and a quarter ounce of dough 
 What yoooouuuu need brah, is to fuck wit yo boy
