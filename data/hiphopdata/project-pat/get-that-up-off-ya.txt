 Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya 
 Get, get that up off, *** you know what this is 
 Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya 
 Get, get that up off, *** you know what this is 
 Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya 
 Get, get that up off, *** you know what this is 
 Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya 
 Get, get that up off, ***a you know what this is 
 I's a big black *** with a big black gun 
 Fo' snaps 'cross ya head and the blood gon' come 
 Some'll run, but'll get flipped off by the sawed off 
 Slugs to his knees like a pit bull gnawed off 
 Hauled off, nothin' but the goods my fair hood 
 *** Be on blow all night like werewolves 
 Prowlin', bitin' at yo' pockets like the howlin' 
 Shoot you in the foot, grab cheese, get on downin' 
 Loungin', on *** leaf, free based'll 
 Run up on ya fast, no mask, bare faced 
 Fired off the glock, snatched loot, then skated 
 Shells wiped down, the police couldn't trace it 
 Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya 
 Get, get that up off, *** you know what this is 
 Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya 
 Get, get that up off, *** you know what this is 
 Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya 
 Get, get that up off, *** you know what this is 
 Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya 
 Get, get that up off, ***a you know what this is 
 Stackin' me up a money scheme, robbin' a fool 
 Murder rate, get away but that ain't the move 
 Long as he, drop the green, then I'mma stay cool 
 Connect the dots, if it means, then I'm lettin' loose 
 *** Play these tough guys like they wanna rumble 
 Knowin' that they mama's boys in this ghetto jungle 
 Hot skillet with them toys mayne, we never humble 
 Buck shot to ya dome don't you make a mumble 
 Brains hangin' out'cha head, people lookin' wowzers 
 It's a bystander put the tone in my trousers 
 So that he couldn't see, sight he couldn't handle 
 Ain't 'cha birthday but I'm blowin' out'cha candles 
 Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya 
 Get, get that up off, *** you know what this is 
 Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya 
 Get, get that up off, *** you know what this is 
 Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya 
 Get, get that up off, *** you know what this is 
 Let me get that up off ya, get that up off ya 
 Get, get that up off, ***a you know what this is 
 Rob that, rob that, rob that, rob that 
 Rob that, rob that, rob that, rob that
