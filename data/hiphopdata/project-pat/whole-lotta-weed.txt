Real playaz like to smoke a (whole lotta weed) 
 Drinkin' bottles of that liquor (all that we need) 
 This 9mm (will make you bleed) 
 I advise you niggaz (don't fuck wit me)

 Real playaz like to smoke a 
 Stroke a offa in her throata 
 Bend ova let me poke her 
 Rolla up some more dopa 
 Don't take me fo a joka 
 Hollows will make ya croaka 
 My hands around your throata 
 Grip grip tight and choke her 
 Hate hate me fo no reason 
 Beat beat yo like a blea 
 Pumpkin head whatchu getta 
 It must be killin' season 
 For some droppas and suckas 
 Coward ass mothufuckas 
 Poppin' off that cappa 
 Could get chu killed like othas 
 Maybe it's not yo time 
 Maybe it could be mine 
 Then put me in a box and burry me wit my nine 
 Forty-Fo and my side 
 Hatas up in south 
 Wishin they put tha bullets up in my body 
 But that's if I'm a gonna 
 When I smell the aroma 
 Of brown cold liquor and polted marijuana 
 Project Pat in this bitcha 
 Tryin' to man get richa 
 The first hit off this dope is gonna getcha 
 Real playaz like to smoke a (whole lotta weed) 
 Drinkin' bottles of that liquor (all that we need)

 I advise you niggaz (don't fuck wit me) 
 Stay down about cho gama 
 Fama I never claima 
 I mug ya in ya facea 
 For those who are a stranga 
 Strange couse I do not knowa 
 Chip chip on yo shoulda 
 I'm knockin' out yo teeths 
 Hits hard just like a boulda 
 I'm creepin' in the Nova 
 So what I'm in codopa 
 A nigga done got boulda 
 His life is gon be ova 
 Grey tape with clip bananna 
 I kidnap I can handle 
 He came to me with Anna 
 He should of mind his manners 
 I hit him with the tecca 
 Damn near tore off his necka 
 He prayin' I'm gon squosh him 
 He shoulda prayed to Mecca 
 You hataz like to tick me 
 Squeeze triggaz till I'm empty 
 This weed turned me out 
 I damn near let it hit me 
 Smokin' nothin' but that fire 
 (Damn that was my last line dog) 
 Nigga you's a lia 
 So you tryin' to screw me 
 I told you not to do me 
 I'm drinkin' on that brewsky 
 This shit is goin' threw me 
 Whole lotta whole lotta whole lotta... 
 Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey 
 Out the pen 
 One more gian 
 Is yo dog stackin ens 
 Makin' cheese fuckin' hoes 
 Knockin' ducks off they toes 
 Up the nose 
 Goes the white 
 Pimpin' hoes take a flight 
 Like a kite like a plane 
 My nigga I'm the man 
 Mista don't take no shit 
 Mista well take yo bitch 
 Ten toes bout to biz 
 Cowards can't handle these 
 Scandle these pair north 
 Bout to bust on my boys 
 Check niggaz fo they grip 
 Pistols swing busted lip 
 Busted chops that's yo ass 
 Punk bitch where's the cash 
 Money green chedder cheese 
 All bitches hit they knees 
 Serve 'em up ready to rock 
 Disturbute them on da check 
 Always keep a mere glock 
 Place it up to your back 
 Fat sacks your smokin' on 
 Mack man wit a tone 
 P-A-T 'bout the lout 
 Ridin' by then I shoot 
 Whos to say cheefin hay 
 Hustlin to get pay 
 Round the clock 
 Round the way 
 Gettin' mines every day
