We ain't out here claimin' killa but we will crack a head (crack a nigga head, crack a nigga head) 
 And one of y'all suckas wanna get some of these (crack a nigga head, crack a nigga head) 
 I'm throwing project hood haymakers in the club on the block 
 Swangin' till you fall then I stomp you with my reeboks 
 Haters used to laugh when I was poor well chuckle this 
 Nothing but very chaps lips tasting knuckle fist 
 Buckle this up in your mind when you was looking mean 
 Hit him in his face eyes roll like a slot machine 
 All up in the club nigga talkin' caught one in the throat 
 Fist to his windpipe that was all that she wrote 
 Hate to see it happen but believe me that it will 
 Violators doggin blood is gonna spill 
 You gonna get some act right reachin' for my hen' bottle slap you in your dome it will send you right into tomorrow 
 We ain't out here claimin' killa but we will crack a head (crack a nigga head, crack a nigga head) 
 And one of y'all suckas wanna get some of these (crack a nigga head, crack a nigga head) 
 You young punks need to walk off in silence 
 Bump into me and experience some of this violence 
 I'm raising chairs up and send your head up into the cushion 
 Some nigga diss north memphis so we had to rush him 
 Talk all that noise but you boys are some trillillas 
 You shall get beat down clown by gorillillas 
 Street raised with some knuckle punch skillillas 
 Don't be amazed saying "whatcha gonna do to us?" 
 'Cause we ain't takin' threats layin bets on who we whooppin' 
 If he got big with one all of us gonna whoop him 
 Ya gal chose so we man up like game time 
 Over a broad you's about to get flatlined 
 We ain't out here claimin' killa but we will crack a head (crack a nigga head, crack a nigga head) 
 And one of y'all suckas wanna get some of these (crack a nigga head, crack a nigga head)
