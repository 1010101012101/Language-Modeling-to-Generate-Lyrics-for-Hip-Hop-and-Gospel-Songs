Relax and take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana 
 Smoke relax and take notes gun smoke gun smoke 
 I just want the paper I just want the paper 
 I just want the paper I just want the paper 
 Relax and take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana 
 Smoke relax and take notes gun smoke gun smoke 
 I just want the paper I just want the paper 
 I just want the paper I just want the paper 
 M.e.m.p.h.i.s 
 I'm a rep this hur till I walk up on death 
 My demise ain't here don't hold your breath 
 Cook heat over beef so I'm somethin' like a chef 
 Purple kushes, my bitches wax off they pussy bushes 
 Eat dick like its delicious, and grant a pimp wishes 
 She dig my country talkin', she say I sound funny 
 Embassy suites sittin' on the bed countin' money 
 Illegal hustlin', dirty money mustlin 
 Spend it like I never saw a day of pain or sufferin' 
 Look at my face you can tell I seen both of em 
 I stick in move do my biz get my doe and dip 
 My chronic habit heavy weed man in every city 
 My money big so my airplane il bitty 
 Major visibility, bad boy lieutenant 
 Black Phantom wit' the black guts and I'm in it 
 Fuck it I'm a blast off, take my mask off 
 Blow ya fuckin' ass off give me the cash cause 
 M-J-G not playin' no games 
 If you not speakin' good don't be sayin' my name 
 Nigga no it ain't OK with you within a day or two 
 I'm a track you down and pull a mufuckin' rapper root 
 Ain't no way you niggas can hide 
 I can get you in the house I can get you outside 
 I'm a load da pump up, lay down jump up 
 Surprise everybody fittin' to help me wit' my come up 
 Damn I done made, all of y'all shit ya jeans 
 This look, like it might be a job for Mr. Clean 
 You all bootleggin' nigga you's a knock off, a imitation 
 Local ass kingpin nigga wit' a limitation 
 You don't want no drama wit' me 
 'Cause I got da ghost of Jeffrey Dona with me 
 Suckas wanna see me fall fall like a ton of bricks 
 It'll never happen dog Project Pat'll play it slick 
 Flick when I'm in the ride nine million homicide 
 Done when ya come wrong shoot suckas in tha Dome 
 Always about the cheese didn't wanna go there 
 He don't wanna pay me where he stay lets roll there 
 What's crooked as a crooked letter hump back hump back 
 Soda cook the dope together jump back jump back 
 Meet any weather cock it pump back pump back 
 If ya bust it first I'm a dump back dump back 
 Down South we gon hustle to the roster crow 
 My nose runnin' still cause a nigga used to blow 
 If pockets low I'll let ya know (don't turn around) 
 A hair trigger that'll bust (don't make a sound) 
 I'm a tell ya what to do (lay it on the ground) 
 Don't be hesitatin' fool (before I blow you down)
