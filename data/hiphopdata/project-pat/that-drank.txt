That 'Train 
 That 'Train 
 That 'Train will make ya think, sizzerp 
 Sippin on some purple 
 I'ma call it yurple 
 Leaning to the sizzide 
 Cool like I'm Erckle 
 Weed got me percule 
 Eyes tight like girdle 
 Cruising through the hood slow, something like a turtle 
 Strapped with them triggas 
 Hanging hanging with my niggas 
 Everybody flossed out 'cause we stacking figgas 
 Hoes getting nothing but some of this nutt in- 
 -Side they esaphagaus bitch you give me sucky 
 On this hydrocodine 
 Or promythzzine 
 Sipping on the sizzerp 
 Sipping on this lizzine 
 Macking in my mizzind 
 I'm staying hizzigh 
 True to the shit I do and that's till I dizzie 
 Suckas wanna stizzep 
 I'ma keep it rezzeal 
 Do watcha gotta do man to get a meazzal 
 Never was a hataa 
 I'ma stay a playaa 
 Sipping on this good 'Train dog everydaya 
 Per-per-per-percocet, zynax I got the best deals 
 I love to get powered up off them x-pills 
 Something to get my swerve on codone dranker 
 Straight out the North Memphis, Tenn on them chrome twenkas 
 Niggas that hate always end up with hot lead 
 I'm with them killas hanging out and we ain't scared 
 Just like my niggas down in Dallas man we already 
 Swinging in work drink that purple with that erky-jerk 
 My grill is gold and I smile but ain't shit funny 
 Like U.G.K. we be hustling for that dirty money 
 We got them hoes that are pros shaking big booties 
 Down with they mane getting that dough doing theirr damn duty 
 I'm on this drank and this drank got me straight mellow 
 Most niggas love purple surp I prefa yellow 
 We been on this, on the town since the 70's 
 Some trill players out the south is who we be's
