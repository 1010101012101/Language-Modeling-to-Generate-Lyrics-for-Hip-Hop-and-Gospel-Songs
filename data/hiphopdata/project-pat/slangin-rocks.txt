Slangin rocks, non stop, non stop, on your block 
 Slangin rocks, non stop, non stop, on your block 
 Slangin rocks, non stop, non stop, on your block 
 Slangin rocks, non stop, non stop, on your block 
 (Repeat 2x) 
 Project pat: 
 Day and night, night and day 
 Nigga gotta get some pay 
 Standing out, with my rocks, and my glock 
 Chiefin hay 
 Anyway that I can 
 My nigga you understand? 
 Gotta bring twenty strong 
 Before I can serve your jaws 
 Double up, man what's up? 
 Got the pot, rock it up 
 Mixed it in some b-12's 
 Now my shit done blown up! 
 Shake the ball, round the chop 
 Till the ball get real hard 
 Cut me down some twenties 
 Then I'm standin out in the yard 
 Junkies coming back and forth 
 One tried to run off with dope 
 Caught him round the corner 
 And I shot the maggot in the throat 
 Don't be playin' with my cheese 
 All I get is 2-0-z's 
 One day I'm gone be the fucking man 
 Out here slangin keys 
 Until then, I'm the nigga runnin' from the undercover 
 Narcotic boys jumpin' fences tryna catch a brother 
 Happy things is all I hear 
 But I'm stayin bout my hog 
 One day I'll be pushin lex 
 But today it's cutlass dog! 
 Gangsta boo: 
 Slangin rocks all good with me 
 Downest bitch that would be me 
 I be on your side like hip-bone 
 And nigga you will see 
 That your misses-lady, your baby 
 Will cover up what you didn't 
 You saw that dope that I stuffed in my pussy 
 I ain't bullshittin! 
 So send me out on a mission 
 We can take they position 
 We got that china, canary-yellow 
 We on all you bitches 
 So come on down 
 You're the next contestant on my dope list 
 I'm tryna put some shoes on rover that I rode in this bitch 
 And we bout our paper, we shuttin your block down 
 We takin' full charge 
 Can't nothin' be done, till project pat said, "yo, fuck all of y'all" 
 I'm from the south 
 So what you mean, you ain't heard about? 
 All them birds that's flyin south 
 That's flyin straight into your mama's house 
 Don't be sayin' you got the clout 
 'Cause we all know who really runnin' thangs 
 All you bustas must behave 
 Cause since we came, it ain't gone be the same 
 I hope you are feeling that 
 I'm lovin' it 
 If you liking it 
 If you wanna get caught up in the realest shit 
 I'm the one who your ass need to deal wit-wooh!
