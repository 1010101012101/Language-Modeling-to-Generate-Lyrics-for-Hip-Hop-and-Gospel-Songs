Tops Drop 
 (Fat Pat) 
 Welcome to the land wherd it just don't stop 
 Trunks pop, tops drop, and the front end hop 
 Pank flop screens on, actin' bad in my zone 
 Yeah it's on, ridin' chrome, ballin at my home 
 Justa a place, don't hate showin up at da state 
 Caint wait get it stright while the front end brake 
 Hey itd cost to be boss, lookin' good when I floss 
 Sunshine let it down, turn it up incline 
 Roll around hit your block drunk gone or not 
 Let it up, let it pop like bump the whole block 
 Southside how we holdin' all the gangsta's throwed 
 Music hittin so hard knockin' outside mobile 
 Hit the highway tokin dro' goin' let it roll 
 Ho what the drink fired of shoin up in the glow 
 Home chrome, high side, throwin' up the south side

 Gettin' ya laced on the thing they call the freeze 
 Bout seen on the track with P A T 
 Know they see how it be, I'm just a G 
 Cocked op on three, blowin' on a whole tree 
 C.B in the drop crowdin down on boys 
 Right behind a Mr. lincoln my favorite toke 
 Candy red, with the screens I'm riding a freak 
 Beemers triple beem makin' reality a dream 
 Sippin lean, Sticky green make me clown the whole scene 
 Uropeians with the grille making all haters chill 
 Why show when they can steal strippin wood grain grille 
 Run the light, shine'n bright, float a smooth as a kite 
 Trunk crack, fat pat, breakin all hata's hats 
 Where they at, where they at, 'for I pull out my gat 
 Looking good is understood flossin for my hood 
 Taking pride in my ride like every player should
