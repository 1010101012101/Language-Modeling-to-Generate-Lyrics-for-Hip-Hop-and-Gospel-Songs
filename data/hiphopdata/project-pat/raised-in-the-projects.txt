(Feat. Chrome) 
 Project Pat: 
 Tryna floss in da projects, mane getcha jacked off 
 Run up on ya wit dat moss bird face smacked off 
 You could be dat nigga 
 On tha curb dat cha crack off 
 Fingaz on the trigger 
 Full of herb neva slack off 
 Same gorrilla tactics ova hurr pockets swollen 
 Pearly white guts 
 Rims big as a somoan? 
 Jolly rancher colors 
 On the whips we be rollin' 
 North Memphis 
 Dirty south you know that I'm holdin' 
 The hood all the way up 
 My nigga you stay up 
 Locked down 
 Now on the town gettin' ma pay up 
 It's project pat 
 The haterz scream Oh NO! 
 Hypmatize stackin money by the boat load 
 Chrome: 
 I ain't eva had nuttin', I hadda get it how I live 
 Hustle fa what I want 
 If I didn't get, take his 
 You would do it ta me 
 On tha real that's how it is 
 Most think it's a game 
 You will getcha self killed 
 Cause hatas spectin' tha deal like they been through what I feel 
 Cause down here shit's real 
 On 7th its fuck feel 
 Playas be straight whilin' 
 Section they public housin' 
 Run up on you an hit cha 
 'Cause I'm tha hata that's prowlin' 
 Gotta beef out this paper 
 No copretta till tomata 
 Don't gimme no altomata da pull back ya patata 
 This projects shit is in it 
 Feel like that since tha 80s 
 Tell 'em Project Pat, I'ma Project Baby!
