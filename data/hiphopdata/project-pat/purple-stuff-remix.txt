(Big Moe) 
 Purple stuff, purple stuff 
 That purple stuff, purple stuff 
 Purple stuff, that purple stuff 
 (Project Pat) 
 Drinkin' on some purple got me feelin' mello 
 Some like promethazine some like the yellow 
 Project on the follow 
 Hit that from the tailow pur-pur-purple stuff 
 Pockets on the swellow 
 Dollars I'ma stackin make that chicken clap an' 
 When I'm in the bedroom hittin it from the backend 
 Freakin that thing on them things kinda swervy 
 Cruise on them 22's tipsy and tervy 
 Chickens actin' birdy, ridin' kinda dirty 
 Eyes like a china mayn high as a birdy' 
 Ridin' kind of early me and Big Mizzo 
 Full of that sizzurp holla at a hizzo 
 Hit up an' I gizzo gone off the drank-drank 
 Go let go my eggo and find you a blood bank 
 You don't get a a dollow 'cause I'm a keep my cheese up 
 Picture me swallow the south off the heezy 
 (Big Moe) 
 The south is off the heezy, the south is off the heezy 
 Ain't no girl talkin' loud out Meezy 
 Really doesn't matter if you're tall or ya big 
 It's that Big Moe and the Screwed Up Click 
 And my kin folk Po-yo always on that purple 
 We stay sippin on the some drr-aank and the Project Pat 
 You know hes got my back 
 I'm all about my fetti, my cream, and my stack 
 I'm a put it down I got the rocks on my wrist 
 Drinkin' throwed cause you know it's like'is 
 I'm a G chop, chop, chop in my ride 
 On that purple stuff it got me feelin' so tight 
 I got to take a drank its in my tummy 
 It got me leanin stand up like a mummy 
 I'm a G and you know I'm throwed in this game 
 I'm a sip, sip, sip, sip until the day that I'm gone 
 (I'm on that purple) 
 Purple stuff, purple stuff 
 Purple stuff, purple stuff 
 (Purple stuff) 
 Purple stuff, that purple stuff 
 (Big Pokey) 
 Dro's in the air, I'm sippin on this liquor 
 I spike mine with sizzurp, mine and this nicca 
 Boys movin quicker then me I'm on lean 
 That and a sack of hydro light green 
 I'm lookin' for somethin' 19 in tight jeans 
 My eyes blood shot pass the visine 
 On a bended knee it's that throwed menage 
 I'm on the petty wit a pocket fulla trojan longs 
 Its some throwed lil broads in the place tonight 
 Gotta pint po'ed up so I'm tastin right 
 We on the case tonight me and da barre baby 
 Noke D, D-Gotti, see we barre crazy 
 (D-Gotti) 
 Muddy cups, but it's drunk 
 Leanin in it slow its some knockin' trunk 
 Purple this, purple that 
 Even slide in the purple candy Caddillac 
 I gotta Kool-Aid smile off some purple Kool-Aid 
 A pump froze, milly, milly a blue ice Gatorade 
 Its some playa drank I was raised on the stuff 
 Uh uh keep that Cris' pass me a muddy cup 
 So I can lean on you like Lamundealaro 
 Here we go again my lil mama hollerin wake up Gotto

 Been tendin to the Barre Yard since Junior High 
 (Chorus) - repeat until fade
