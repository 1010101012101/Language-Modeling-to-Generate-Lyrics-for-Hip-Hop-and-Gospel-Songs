(Repeat: x10) 
 I ain't gonna make it rain 
 I ain't gonna bullshit you 
 Dirty bitch, a dirty bitch 
 A dickie dirty bitch, a dirty bitch 
 A dickie, yous a trifala heffa 
 A lil' heffa, yous a trifala heffa 
 A lil' heffa 
 Rollin' through the hood just gettin' my car washed up 
 Me and two of my dogs got that good gettin' fired up 
 Screen flippin' from the roof better watch your head 
 Pumpin' by sixteen niggas, you scared! 
 Spot a couple of dirt bags at the bus stop 
 Should I ride down on 'em why not 
 Spit some pimpin' in a hoes ear right quick 
 Snatch one tell her, motel 6 
 Get the hoes blowed out, put the coke up they nose 
 Next thing I know got the dick clean, diamond thugs 
 Sippin' up now our job, they was wasted 
 Kissin' each other big smiles on they faces 
 Man I love a 
 Got apple bottom jeans but your nails lookin' dusty! 
 You the man broad in the club got it musky 
 Super loud mouth, naggin' very fussy 
 Open toe shoes, toe nails kinda crusty 
 I like a dirt bag, copin' burns on her knees 
 Penis in her mouth make my balls say cheese! 
 Hand they back cause you beggin' for a new dress 
 Gel slicked back perm lookin' like a hot mess 
 I gotta get mine I gotta get my dick sucked 
 Pull my pants down open your mouth, attention 
 I take a chillin' weave girl with a big butt 
 Gotta be a bad bitch a ghetto hood slut 
 I'ma knock it out when she drop it pop it out 
 I'm just a pimp nigga puttin' these hoes on the house 
 Cars, clothes, hoes that's what juicy all about 
 Keep this dope rolled put this sticky in your mouth
