Shiny rims like a star, I've been tippin on some bong 
 Blow a ounce of that good, when I come through my hood 
 They be like, I likes dat bout dat boy 
 They be like, I likes dat bout dat boy 
 Night light flickin high, and I'm ridin' in a benz 
 I sware when I'm in it, I got so many friends 
 I got so much money, in my pocket right now 
 Bad broad to my right, rollin' blunts, pickin' up da pound 
 Got a forty cal. sittin' on my left leg, hand on the woodgrain 
 V-12 engine, plus the bump bang 
 Cruizin through da bay, going to fuck wit UTT 
 Gotta holla at my folks when I'm in these city streets 
 I be in and outta town like a greyhound bus 
 As soon as I reach da town I'm callin my boo to get in them guts 
 I gotta do it big, why? everybody is watchin 
 Comin' through da hood iced out shinin and flossin 
 Shiny rims like a star, I've been tippin on some bong 
 Blow a ounce of that good, when I come through my hood 
 They be like, I likes dat bout dat boy 
 They be like, I likes dat bout dat boy 
 If I come down ya block, and ya see them twenty fours 
 Just know I could of put twenty sixes on this hoe 
 They would fit with no rub, would have fit like a glove 
 But I'm five foot nine so I would have had to jump up in the truck 
 And I got things to do, places to go 
 People to see, dro to smoke 
 Liquor to drink, pills to roll 
 Money to make, and money to blow 
 I've been grindin since I as seventeen 
 So I'm supposed to have it 
 Shinin like a diamond 
 Hatas sick and man they can't stand it 
 Doubt me now's a classic 
 Phinally phamous was unbelievable 
 The one and only's gunna be the CD that they bleedin for 
 And yes I know my game has stepped up 
 I'm a grown man, theys like dat bout dat boy 
 Hatas still don't understand 
 Shiny rims like a star, I've been tippin on some bong 
 Blow a ounce of that good, when I come through my hood 
 They be like, I likes dat bout dat boy 
 They be like, I likes dat bout dat boy
