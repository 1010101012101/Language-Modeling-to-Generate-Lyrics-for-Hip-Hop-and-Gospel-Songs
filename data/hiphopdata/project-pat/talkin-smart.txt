Talkin' smart 8x 
 (Leads into chorus) 
 Talkin' smart to a pimp, you done broke the first rule 
 You done broke the first rule 
 You done broke the first rule 
 You a smart mouth, gator mouth, out of pocket bitch 
 You done robbed your first pimp and tried to bring me his shit 
 Then choose a v10 bitch, all you got is 8 
 That's a nigga lifesavings, you a faggot he a fake bitch 
 I got too much cake plus, 
 Bitch I'm on parole plus, 
 Bitch I pimped this microphone my mouthpiece is too cold 
 She'll be stunned by some small change 
 Bitch, do you see this chain 
 Bitch, can't you see I got ya life around my pinky rang 
 Dope game cocaine, boy I done sold it all 
 No steel, running light, that I love to ball 
 Now its only money, ain't no powder in my hundreds bills 
 See a pimp shiny bitch tell me how your pussy feels 
 Talkin' smart to a pimp, you done broke the first rule 
 You done broke the first rule 
 You done broke the first rule 
 You're a smart mouth freak with a mouthful of cum 
 Empty your purse when your done 
 All you got is bubblegum 
 Little girl is you trippin' 
 Disrespectin pimpin' 
 Coppin college square ho's 
 Mang then I'm flippin 
 Straight into turning tricks 
 Throw her in the snake pit 
 Shake ya booty wrestle with these guys 
 Bring me a grip 
 Trip if ya wanna tho 
 That'll get your jaw swole 
 Bring me the pot of gold, otherside of rainbow 
 Go insert liquid cum 
 Get it boy lil head 
 You wanna do it anyway 
 Might as well, make some bread 
 Scared!? say your scared (scared) 
 Or your face will get caved in 
 From a niggas knuckles, then your butt hit the pavement 
 Talkin' smart to a pimp, you done broke the first rule 
 You done broke the first rule 
 You done broke the first rule
