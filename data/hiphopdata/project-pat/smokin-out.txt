Smokin' out like Chief Wahoo hoo 
 Chase it down with the liquor and brew brew 
 Pass it round that's the way we do do 
 Somebody get this dope 'cause I'm through through 
 (Project Pat) 
 Roll up a blunt like light up the green 
 Eyes red as fire I'm on promethazyne 
 Roll up another one dipped in the sizzer 
 Save it for later mane cause it wouldn't hizzer 
 Soon as the thund-ah enters my lungs-ah 
 I start gettin' hungry where's that balogna 
 Crackers and cheese zuzus and whams 
 Icy white honey bun ooh there I am 
 Go an light another one constantly smokin' 
 Turn up a 45 drankin and chokin 
 Start smokin' weed real young with my peers 
 So full of dope smoke comin' out my ears 
 Burnt fingernails ain't made no sales 
 Y'all might be short an ounce or two on them scales 
 To hell with that fool go an take a pull 
 We cheefin all night and we stay gettin' food 
 (Lord Infamous) 
 You ask if Lord were a drug a drug 
 Ay what drug would Lord be he be 
 Yo Lord would be a pound of weed 
 But no stems no sticks no seeds 
 It's just because I believe-ah 
 In cannabis se-teev-ah 
 M-I-L-U-N-G-S I keep the sticky green-ah 
 Puffahontis puff a peace pipe ridin' on my peet-ah 
 What's my favorite flower it's that marijuna leaf-ah 
 I keep-ah O the F to O the R to D 
 I be on the B-L the U-N-T 
 I brew a cup of shrooms and break down the B-A-G ah 
 Purple kush pretty bush Cheech 'n' Chong in me-ah 
 I'm the Scarecrow me in the Ville protecting acres 
 Smokin' tough to bong a swisher leaf just simply papers
