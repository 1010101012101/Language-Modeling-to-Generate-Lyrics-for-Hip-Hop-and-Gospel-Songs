 I had *** in my mouth, razor blade in my hand 
 If a ** hittin' *** then you get it from the man 
 Understand I can do the thang, any way you want it 
 We can make it quarter key or a *** for the hundred 
 Want it now, maybe wanna come through a lil' later 
 Got a line up my nose, size of the equator 
 Take a ounce of that pure, then make it into two 
 Bakin' soda make it stretch, on the stove it'll brew 
 Come on through, I ain't worried 'bout no *** on a jackin' 
 I got killers front and back do', who ain't on no actin' 
 Guns clackin' triggers pull, sendin' suckers straight to Heaven 
 You'll get hit in the head wit' this **-47 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it we can flip it 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it co*** 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it we can flip it 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it co*** 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it we can flip it 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it co*** 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it we can flip it 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it co*** 
 Residue on the table from the *** we's choppin' 
 Our balls big as golf balls, we's been sno'tin' 
 Up all night in this trap house, *** know we got clout 
 'Caine slangers on the blade know what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 'Bout to bring the *** to the hood like a blizzard 
 Dodgin' police and this trap they movin' like a lizard 
 Hoovin' got a pipeline comin' out of Dallas 
 Got a mansion in Memphis down there, got a palace 
 I'm addicted to this hustle game just like the *** 
 Tell myself I'mma quit but I can't stop it mayne 
 Love the cars, love the clothes, diamonds in my mouth 
 Down here dope is cheaper so we boomin' down south 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it we can flip it 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it co*** 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it we can flip it 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it co*** 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it we can flip it 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it co*** 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it we can flip it 
 We can s*** it we can flip it, we can s*** it co*** 
 Co***, co***, co***, co*** 
 Co***, co***, co***
