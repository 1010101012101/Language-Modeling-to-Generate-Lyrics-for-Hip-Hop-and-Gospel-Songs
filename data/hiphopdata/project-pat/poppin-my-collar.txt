Now eva' since I can remember 
 I've been poppin' my collar 
 (Poppin' poppin' my collar) 
 (Poppin' poppin' my collar) 
 Now eva since I can remember 
 I've been workin these ho's 
 En they betta put my money in my hand 
 Now eva since I can remember

 (Poppin' poppin' my collar) 
 (Poppin' poppin' my collar) 
 Now eva since I can remember

 I know you sicker than sick-ah 
 When you see the rims flick-ah 
 Paint drip off 
 Ice in my Range glitt-ah 
 I straight flippa 
 The cheese like pancake 
 Foldin' my cheese like the leaves 
 In my hand bricka? 
 Project Pat-ter 
 Attracted to dime pieces 
 I'm dirty southern 
 French braids, gold teeth 
 I'm out here makin' sense 
 Plus, I'm out here makin' dollars 
 I keep a bad broad, though 
 And a popped collar 
 Now eva' since I can remember 
 I've been poppin' my collar 
 (Poppin' poppin' my collar)

 Now when it comes to getting bread I got the keys to the bakery 
 A lot of dudes swear they play, man they some fackery 
 Let me catch a girl up out some work in my site 
 And believe I'm gon be atcha in the daylight with a flashlight 
 I'm tryin' to get paid however money is made 
 A lot dudes like to pay ladies to get laid 
 But me, I ain't no pimp, I just love to borrow 
 Paper from a fat bitch, a ugly bitch, a model fa real 
 Well you know me by the Juice man hangin' out with Big Triece 
 Standin on tha porch, drinkin' liquor, drunk, smokin' weed 
 Trying to get a paycheck, but work that ain't came yet 
 That's why I stay in a girl ear, to keep that pussy wet 
 So I could get paid and relax in the shade 
 And say fuck a nine to five 'cause a nigga tired of slavin 
 It's never easy for a playa in tha hood on tha come up 
 If I meet a gal with three kids or more she get done up 
 Now eva' since I can remember 
 I've been poppin' my collar 
 (Poppin' poppin' my collar) 
 (Poppin' poppin' my collar) 
 Now eva since I can remember 
 I've been workin these ho's 
 En they betta put my money in my hand 
 Now eva since I can remember 
 I've been poppin' my collar 
 (Poppin' poppin' my collar) 
 (Poppin' poppin' my collar) 
 Now eva since I can remember 
 I've been workin these ho's 
 En they betta put my money in my hand 
 She's just another ho that I met in the hood 
 I told her I was Crunchy Black and it was all good 
 She might as well go on head and suck on my wood 
 And let me whisper something in her ear if I could 
 I got some hoes out there bringin' ya boy back some good 
 That ghetty green you know what I mean that bitch is understood 
 Ain't havin' to shout at no motherfuckin slut 
 You know I'm actin' bitch make cut a fuckin' rug 
 You better get out there and get my money in the woods 
 I'mma hit cha in ya head and leave ya ass with a plug 
 You know I gotta have, gotta get my money what 
 These hoes out here be fucking for a muthafucking dub, FREAK BITCH!
