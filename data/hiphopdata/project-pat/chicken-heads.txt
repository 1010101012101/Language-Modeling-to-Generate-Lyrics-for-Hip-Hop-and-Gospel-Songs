 Always in my face 
 Talkin' this and that

 But ya gas tank is on E 
 Be stepping out 
 Ain't no descent shoes on ya feet 
 That's just the meter broke 
 Youn't know'cha talkin' 'bout 
 Anyway them new Jordans finna come out 
 Hate see ya in a club 
 Ya mobbin' wit a mug 
 Know that ya ridin' wit ya boy 
 Ya nothing but a scrub 
 But he was with me 
 That's when you hated 
 'Cause when I got up on ya friend 
 Ya damn-near fainted

 Mouth fulla golds 
 But yo ass need some tic tacs

 Now these chicken head hoes 
 See this platinum thick as white gold 
 See the 20 inch Pirelli's roll 
 Mane thank the vogues, dodgin all my foes 
 Ridin' Cady truck wit DVD 
 A flock of broads follow me 
 From the club to break they knees 
 Knowin' that's all I want 
 Straight out tha club 
 Tha rest ain't smellin' right 
 The last thang on they mind is freshin' up 
 It's goin' down tonight 
 Weave in they head 
 Weed in they purse, still crunk 
 Baby seats all across the back 
 Wit close in the trunk 
 I been known to hold my own 
 I been known to ride on chrome 
 I been known to flip a platinum 
 Watch wit the diamond stones 
 I'm the fool supplyin' tha dro 
 I'm tha fool supplyin' tha blow 
 I'm tha playa who got you 
 Chicken heads knockin' at my do 
 Tellin' me that you diggin' me 
 Tellin' me I'm yo man to be

 Get yo rags and work that streets 
 Pay ya boy and make me rich
