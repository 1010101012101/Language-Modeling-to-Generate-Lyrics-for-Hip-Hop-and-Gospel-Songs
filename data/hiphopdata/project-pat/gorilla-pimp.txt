If you thinking I'm straight then you better think twice 
 If you ain't got no cheese then I'm jekyl and hyde 
 'Bout to click on this bitch 'cause she need to learn me 
 Beat her with my pistol when I thought she burned me 
 It's the first tha month you can call me Sambo 
 I'ma dick this ho down 'cause I like to gamble 
 In her purse I ramble 
 On her head I trample 
 Where the hell the damn doe 
 Old silly ass hoe 
 You gon get tha damn doe 
 And I like to chew snow 
 Sippin' yak with tha cap is the perfect convo 
 You can be a Jane Doe if you call the po-po 
 (Female voice) I'ma call ya momma a 
 Bitch that's a no no 
 Don't get personal, I'll never let go 
 If you did wanna run you'll get beat to the flo' 
 I'ma gorilla pimp you can call me great ape 
 Knockin' teefus out ya mouth need to get ya shit straight 
 I'ma gorilla on the hoes 
 Dig dat 
 I'ma Pimp nigga you ain't know? 
 Dig dat 
 I'ma a mack mane on the stroll 
 Dig dat 
 I'm out here trying to make a ho 
 Dig dat 
 'Cause I hustle on the low 
 Dig dat 
 I ain't tryin' to go parole 
 Dig dat 
 So bitch don't try me ho 
 Dig dat 
 If you do I'ma cut ya throat 
 Dig dat 
 (Verse Two) 
 Talkin' smart to a pimp you done broke the first rule 
 I'ma come on your job I'ma act a damn fool 
 When ya boss walk in I'ma play it off cool 
 If he step in our biz I'ma slap his ass too 
 All that loud talkin' ho need to gon' settle down 
 'Fore you friend have to pick ya ass up off the ground 
 I got love for ya purse meaning that I love you 
 Married to this cheese first and I'm screamin' I do 
 No money for a mack mean drama for a ho 
 Paramedics toting you through the trauma center do' 
 Busted lips broken leg but I got my bank roll 
 Tried to put a struggle up but she got her eye swoll 
 Buying you Taco Bell but a pimp eating Steak 
 Corn Bread Collard Greens Chit-a-lings on my plate 
 Always late for a date and she always trippin' 
 She can hate my fuckin' guts but she lovin' my pimpin' 
 (Verse Three) 
 Mixin' game with some 'yak is a deadly potion 
 If I hit it from the back bitch I want devotion 
 In ya pussy strokin' 
 Ho a pimp is spoken 
 DOA if you try to play my emotions 
 I'ma crack a ho's dome I ain't broke the damn law 
 Loan a nigga my phone so I broke the bitches jaw 
 You done quit ya damn job and you need to start hoin' 
 Boostin clothes playin' tricks cause a pimp ain't goin' 
 In the club shakin ass that can bring plenty cash 
 But ya get mo' loot with a VIP pass 
 Say ya ass got robbed when ya shoulda got a hundred 
 Now you get the fuck up out of here go and get my money 
 You dummy tryin' to pop phoning me a get ya killed 
 Bitch I ain't the chargee I'ma charge you for real 
 So don't get it twisted I'm the pimp you the bitch 
 Either bring the loot quick or you get ya throat slit 
 I'ma Gorilla on the hoes...
