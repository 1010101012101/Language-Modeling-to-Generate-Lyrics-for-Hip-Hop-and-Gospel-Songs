 Shut ya mouth shut ya mouth shut shut ya mouth bitch (8x)

 Shut ya mouth bitch shut ya mouth bitch 
 Before a nigga hit yo ass in the mouth bitch 
 Shut ya mouth bitch shut ya mouth bitch 
 Before a nigga hit yo ass in the mouth bitch 
 Shut ya mouth bitch shut ya mouth bitch 
 'Cause you know it's going down in the south bitch 
 (Project Pat) 
 Nigga down here on and you suckas mane 
 But don't get crazy 'cause you knows we keep the auto-mag 
 You pushing daisy's never the false shit I spit the facts 
 'Cause dogg I'm knowing I pull on ya bitch I'm riding phat 
 That hoe is going we the trillest of the trilly trill 
 You suckas muggin staying down about a milly mil 
 This ghetto thuggin' got me paid 
 Cowards running lipers 
 They say I'm flossin hoe my name tasting like some shiter 
 Went in your jaw and throw these bullets straight at'cha grill 
 Commits to walking from the scenary I keeps it real 
 I do no talking just stupitity I let ya squeal 
 You get the squaking up in yo yard with the wood dogg 
 38 barking see yo tongues and the root of evil 
 That's in the bible dig and dirt there should be no sequel 
 That's to your title rumors leakin out like a faucet 
 Stank like a burger with some onions or some hot gossip for that I murda 
 (DJ Paul) 
 See I'm the king of the M slash C.E.O of Memphis 
 Riding hundred thousand dollar cars and feeling so damn pimpish 
 I'm the reason why you boys went back to your old style 
 I'ma hit you were it hurt 'cause DJ Paul so damn wild 
 I know a bullshit nigga that should have been born dead 
 Fake as a superman movie I put some led in his head 
 Bogus as counterfit money my police nigga did hunta 
 Dropping dimes is his hobby now I want his ho I hit 
 (Juicy J) 
 I used to ride with the illest straight killa niggas D-boys 
 Rape his fellas but I seen the bigga picture 
 Like if ya on ya last bag sprinkle little bit of weed 
 In a blunt 'cause a nigga had to stretch the figgas money 
 Don't grow on trees so we had to stack the cheese 
 Niggas out here phonie have ya spooked to slang the keys 
 Mane I'm like a diner thief asking niggas pass the piece 
 Cowards out here hating on me 
 Check the hook this ain't a please faggot 
 (Crunchy Blac) 
 What's the business what's the business 
 When ya see C.B it big business 
 I don't wanna here no muthafuckin shiznet 
 Just get over there and get the shit bitch 
 Niggas clapping and clapping 
 Niggas jamming you up 
 I'ma let off some shots and scream in gats we trust 
 Ain't no fucking with me ain't no fucking with us 
 And if ya fucking with us we put ya body in dust 
 (Frayser Boy) 
 I got my glock in my hand I got my hand on my glock 
 So if a nigga get wrong mane then a nigga get popped 
 'Cause mane I bet you gone drop 
 Dogg when I close down your shop 
 So when you out in the public best hang around you a cop 
 So you can have you some protection 
 'Cause mane the shit get so hectic 
 And when I come in yo present nigga you better respect it 
 Frayser Boy I unload on one of you bitches though 
 No understanding when you try to play me like a little hoe fasho
