Welcome to the Hypnotize zone 
 Today you'll hear the story of Russell Resthaven 
 And the day he tried to save his girlfriend 
 Here's the story 
 (Project Pat) 
 Man you won't believe what done happened to me now man 
 ()

 (Project Pat) 
 How did this nigga come round my way then fuck my bitch 
 But I'm gone kill him when he get off work tonight though 
 () 
 Man fuck dat hoe man you can't be tryin' to save that bitch 
 Man my nigga den housed a hoe to Brown Freesia 
 (Project Pat) 
 Man I spent cheese on her and everything 
 And I bought rangs and mo shit man 
 I'mma kill that nigga dat I'm goin' marry 
 () 
 You can't turn a hoe into a house wife man 
 (Project Pat) 
 I love her man 
 I love her man 
 It's mine man 
 I love her man 
 I gotta marry her man 
 I'mma marry her 
 Don't save her she don't wanna be saved 
 (Ain't nothin' going on but the money and power) 
 Don't save her she don't wanna be saved 
 (Got one in the chamber for you weak ass coward) 
 Don't save her she don't wanna be saved 
 (Verse 1: Project Pat) 
 I'mma introduce me Project Pat I keep it real 
 I'mma introduce you you's a sucka faking deals 
 If you gonna let these freaky hoes run yo life 
 I don't understand how you turn a freak into a wife 
 I don't need to get why you be eating out her draws 
 You done bought the bitch a phone 
 Now you screamin in all the calls 
 It's about O-A.M. she ain't nowhere to be found 
 Some-where wit her friend dick in face and turned to ground 
 But you best save it last and you know that she'll go 
 Suckin dick, chewin cad, and I hear she on that blow 
 Did a line maybe two now she down to do the dew 
 Took her to the studio so she down to do the crew 
 I know just what to do 
 You can ask the hoe to leave 
 Once the bitch pack her shit 
 Hurry up and run them streets 
 Two things I ain't never in my life done seen before 
 It's a U.F.O or a hoe that wouldn't go 
 (Verse 2: Project Pat) 
 Jackie's simple 
 Jackie's quicker 
 Jackie likes to suck a dick-a 
 All she wanna do smoke a blunt get a drink of liquor 
 Lip-ah to the balls booty even enough to smell dodie 
 You be tryna save a sweater but you need the fuckin' letter 
 Be the bitch she really is-a 
 Suck my dick you goin' kiss her 
 Hating hoes try to dis her every nigga wanna hit her 
 Get her in the bed lay her down boots wanna fell 
 Call her up there nig man there's a way-a 
 She the star of the foota pussy wet real gooda 
 Camcorder caught on tape did I stutter man I should of 
 Fucked her in her mouth fast she be taking all cash 
 Keep my tank from Florida she pay for my gas 
 Ass for my nigga drop-a somewhere tryna watch her 
 Pregnant by another man but you wanna be the papa 
 Nut, come, but she crave-a backseat misbehava 
 You'll never get the bitch 'cause she wit that West Haven 
 (Verse 3: Crunchy Black) 
 Ain't nothin' goin' on but the money and power 
 Got one in the chamber fo you weak ass cowards 
 And I'm tired of you niggas goin' saving dese bitches 
 Stop saving these hoes let another nigga get deep down in them draws 
 Take her over to my dogs so we can do her y'all 
 Everybody can do it let's just have a ball 
 Ain't nothin' goin' on but the money and power 
 Too many niggas out here cowards 
 They be saving dem hoes they be paying them hoes 
 But a nigga like me can not go 
 I'm be kickin in doos I be fuckin' dese hoes 
 I be slamin 'em down like Dominoes 
 Bitch you didn't know it's CB bro 
 In and out dese hoes does like pole
