(Verse One) 
 As a youngsta guns-ah 
 What I specalize in 
 Me and my dawgs selling dope on a rising 
 Rising to gives we together in this hood life 
 Struggling together straight praying for the good life 
 Yo life means more to me then my own do 
 When you had some beef I went and shot on that whole crew 
 I do what I gotta do 'cause I'm yo right hand 
 You's a-lot older then me I'm yo little man 
 Mane time fly's now we old to older 
 You done came up flippin pebbles to bolders 
 Told ya that I'm down with you until the graveyard 
 Me and you got caught with some work in the same car 
 You were facing more time then me if behind bars 
 I was seventeen and a half so I took the charge 
 You got larger heard now you own a crack house 
 I did two years and they let a nigga back out 
 Since you's a on nigga on nigga fuck which ya boy 
 Knowing good and well I grew up which ya boy 
 You's a on nigga on nigga don't try to flauge 
 You gonna make a nigga like me catch a charge 
 (Verse Two) 
 Back out on the town and you riding in the jag clean 
 Hit me with a pound then bought me a chevy thang 
 I could of saved in flew like the canary 
 You know I got heart and I know you very scary 
 Carrying alot of weight put in plenty work 
 Always was down for ya dawg did plenty dirt 
 Looking like a jerk and ya living like a kingpin 
 That ain't showing love 
 I'm about to stick this tone inside ya fucking face 
 Blow ya brains to the other side

 But inside the walls you be soaking up game quick 
 Fuck that gurellia shit trick I done got slick 
 Remember ya kept ya dope backyard dawg house 
 Over there hold gun lap

 Looking for the cross that will come up from behind ya 
 Muthafuck the laws 'cause I'm taking what's mine-ah

 Mom's went to church so I'm jumping over gate fast 
 You mane was outta town handling business 
 Blew both rockwilders out they misery 
 You got it fist in good so they coulden't see 
 Yeah it's kind of obvious what I came for 
 Herion and that white-dust ain't no shame boy 
 A real robber robs a trick and don't say a word 
 Got'em for a pound of herion and bout eight birds 
 Mouth slurred 'cause a nigga blowing on some good shit 
 Celebrating 'cause a playa done made a phat lick 
 Any trick do this to me hollow points fly 
 Dead in the face right between muthafuckas eye
