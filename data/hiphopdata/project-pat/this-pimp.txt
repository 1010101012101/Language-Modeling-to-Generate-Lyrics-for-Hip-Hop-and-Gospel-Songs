Talking... 
 (Project Pat) 
 Hoe I know you got this loot 
 Fuck around make me shoot 
 Up I'm like I'm a rocket 
 Yeah I knock it when I hit them boots 
 Make that pussy wetter then 
 Running like a faucet tap 
 Though we get ya stupid then 
 Yo face is gonna get a slap 
 Thorough breds are on the map 
 Pimps are riding checky tramps 
 Prostituting straight up looting table dances in ya lap 
 Keep a cough drop in ya cap 
 Like the way that booty flap 
 Nine hundred every night so you know that pussy snap 
 Take me off the weight of fame 
 I'm'a let you run ya game 
 But if it don't profit us that'll bring a pimp to shame 
 Swang a fist 'bout a her eye 
 Kiss my dick never good-bye 
 Fuck around and break ya leg hoe if ya tell a lie 
 Biggest booty in the club-ah 
 I'm the dad you the mother 
 Out here corning like no other 
 You's a freaky muthafucka 
 What they used to say to ya 
 Hooker now they paying ya 
 Me and you done falled off broke yeah that's what they praying for 
 You don't never wanna try (This Pimp this pimp) 
 I'll bust ya head you tell a lie (Don't trip don't trip) 
 I'm'a look you in ya eye (And take grip and take grip) 
 You get wrong you receive (A fat lip a fat lip) 
 I'm bout to whip on this maggot means nothing bitch 
 Got a cute little face and a tight little switch 
 Getting rich off the chick'ill never happen in a milli-ion 
 Tired just from now 'cause she a civilian 
 Not a soldier to this army'ill make ya change 
 Come up shorter and your face I'm'a re-arrange 
 You was looking strange but your pockets looking stranger 
 I was bumpin me some ruffin in the changer 
 Swollen eyes busted lips but you know I'm loving you 
 In the club shakin hips everyday I'm cussing you 
 Bitch I'm never trusting you that's because I'm smart hoe 
 Other niggas give ya cheese they ain't got no heart though 
 Hoe I'm gonna start yo ass with empty purse 
 Break you like a cash register then put in hearse 
 Conscience to the grave and I hope that you can see 
 That I must get paid if you wants to fuck with me 
 Peter pipper beat the bitch 
 Sweeped her in the conflict 
 Through the town spit his game 
 Introduced her to a trick 
 Make-up hoe like a queen 
 Cooking cakes candy rings 
 Feeling up her pussy hole 
 Rub her for the dingalings 
 But the hoe didn't meet her quarter 
 So I walked out in an order 
 Break away from getting slapped start running for the border 
 Known to whip you out your draws 
 Bitch done went and told them laws 
 Got domestic violent charge in the morning out them bars 
 Duck niggas hate this shit 
 Catch'em going quack quack 
 Try snitching to a bitch trying to hold the mack back 
 But it ain't gone happen 'cause the playas out here rapping 
 To these hoes laying down the law while I get the cap'n 
 Head cracking in a brick wall 
 Got me in a midst brawl 
 Showing out infront of folk 
 That'll make me kill y'all 
 Muthafuckin ass beat ya down like ya stole something 
 Turn right around hey hoe let me hold something 
 You don't never wanna try (this pimp this pimp this pimp)
