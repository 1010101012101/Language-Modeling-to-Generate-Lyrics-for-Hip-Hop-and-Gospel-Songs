I keep my cup raised up, 
 My nigga 'cause I'm a playa' 
 Nigga 'cause I'm a playa' 
 Nigga 'cause I'm a playa' 
 My dollars stay stackin' 
 Nigga 'cause I be mackin' 
 Nigga 'cause I be mackin' 
 Nigga 'cause I be mackin' 
 (Pat:) 
 I'm just out here slangin' CD's 
 Nigga, like ruffle rockers 
 They rollin' hypnotized 
 We quick to knock off your block uh 
 Blastin' nothin' but chalk uh 
 Nigga we non stop uh 
 Whippin' up this cream real mean, 
 Like betty crocker 
 The guts icy white 
 And leather is what I'm likin' 
 Pull up, chrome rims 
 Them holla she must be dykin' 
 Like she don't see them colors change 
 Colors on my paint job 
 Just like all them colors 
 On my ice in my wrist watch 
 Pimps got, nothin' but some conversation for some dough 
 Slangin' these words out my mouth 
 Like I'm sellin' snow 
 Tellin' no lies, compromise 
 Only cheese wise 
 If you try to cross real killers 
 Then you must die 
 (Pimp c:) 
 Macaroni, pretty toni 
 Snow, I keep it poppin' 
 Move it to the internet 
 Keep that pussy droppin' 
 Mop it up, slop it up 
 See the ball, chop it up 
 Whoof it up 
 Sit down on that knee 
 I fin to push it up 
 If the game was over 
 I'd get me some work and cook it up 
 Wanna show this rookie up 
 You wannabe now hook it up 
 We run the streets, I seen a part 
 Up in this shit I took it up 
 She wanted me to hit her pussy 
 I'ma go off in her butt 
 What you gon' do 
 When that thang go to fightin' 
 I'ma lay it deep off in them hoes 
 Them hoes be boppin' 
 Tellin' me to stop a bitch 
 I ain't fin to stop it 
 Your pussy is a pit bull, bitch 
 Down and lock it 
 Fuckin' ride with me 
 I knock your thang up out a socket 
 Your hoe wanna look at me 
 Your bitch is out of pocket 
 Flyin' in the bentley 
 Get me sucked just like a rocket 
 Pimp-c bitch 
 I got a zoo off in my closet 
 (Pat:) 
 Crusin' chessie aveneue, in the hood 
 It's a sunny day 
 Jonesed out walkin', mini skirts 
 Let the bunnies play 
 Money stay, in a niggas' pocket 
 Wrapped in rubber bands 
 Seven hun-ed ones with my seve-ty benjimans 
 Understand, got the hollow jackets 
 In the barrel-rel 
 Make a wild nigga wanna walk 
 The straight and narrow-row 
 My dogs strapped, on point 
 Guard be like the fed'ral-ral 
 A hundred shots 
 Comin' out the mouth of the calico 
 Ye know, man a nigga lose 
 What he gon' do 
 I'm lookin' for some beef 
 But the kind at a barbecue 
 Comin' through, lookin' old school 
 Box chevy thang 
 Ride 22's on you foo's 
 Let the system bang 
 I keep my cup raised up... (raised up, raised up)
