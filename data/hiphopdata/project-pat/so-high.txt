So high, the time is 
 So high, so high, so high 
 So high, the time is 
 H-A-Y slice the blunt, light green shit (the time is) 
 (Project Pat) 
 You know I get high like Jamaican, 
 Light ya blunts up, shot-guns I'm takin' 
 To the head dawg, break down the hydro 
 Or some reg'la', it get'cha high tho. 
 Some of y'all like to smoke on the babbage, 
 It look light green, but we like cabbage. 
 Get the razor slice down the opti- 
 -Mo, my nigga, we bout ta party. 
 Smokin' weed to us is a hobby, 
 Eyes like Chinese, smoke in my body. 
 Once I'm high mane don't try to blow it, 
 Ain't no passin' I must enjoy it. 
 Me and my dawgs gangsta and heavy, 
 C and Toby ride in that chevy, 
 Wit' the TV's we, we got plenty 
 Dope ta smoke on, flashin' on twenties. 
 (Lord Infamous) 
 I love dope, dope loves me, 
 I'm high till I D-I-E. 
 With a big bag of bud, and a bag of tooty toot, 
 I know that you get high too. 
 As I chief, upon the leaf, of swisher sweet. 
 The D tha tha tha O the P the E. 
 The C the tha tha O the K the E. 
 I need the B da you the da da D. 
 Scarecrow's a cloud of smoke, 
 Always on the thunder. 
 Puffin' on the purple cush, 
 White willow marijuana. 
 I stay fucked up, on a daily basis. 
 Maybe the reason I got all these cases? 
 Extacy orange juice makes me, me so horny. 
 Super pimp coked out, coked out till the morning. 
 Hydrocozone sniff snoff as I sniff sniff, 
 Come let Lord Infamous come take a whiff.
