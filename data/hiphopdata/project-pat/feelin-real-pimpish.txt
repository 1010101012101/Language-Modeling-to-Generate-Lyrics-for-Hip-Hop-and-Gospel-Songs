(Chorus - Project Pat) 
 In the hood stackin funds 
 Got me feelin' real pimpish 
 Purple kush in my lungs 
 Got me feelin' real pimpish 
 Got carrots in the charms? 
 Got me feelin' real pimpish 
 Feelin' real pimpish 
 Got me feelin' real pimpish 
 Big wheels on the ride 
 Got me feelin' real pimpish 
 Peanut butter all inside 
 Got me feelin' real pimpish 
 Jealous when I ride by 
 Got me feelin' real pimpish 
 Feelin' real pimpish 
 Got me feelin' real pimpish 
 (Verse 1 - Lil Wyte) 
 I'm feelin' real damn pimpish, I'm blinging, I'm high as a kite 
 I'm clean, I'm clean headed to the club tonight 
 If I see ya you know ima dip down and holla 
 As long as it don't slow up my dollas 
 Ima fall back way back peepin VIP 
 Where the club owner told us it was cool to smoke weed 
 Black light, neon lights all they see is the charm 
 We strapped, we strapped and we ain't out to cause harm 
 In the hood stackin funds peanut butter in the ride 
 We ain't even worried 'bout the haters on the otha side 
 I've been feelin' real pimpish since I stepped out the door 
 New shoes new clothes new cars and new dro 
 (Verse 2 - Lil Wyte) 
 Now I'm circilin the bay bangin' feelin' real pimpish 
 And I'm feelin' real pimpish from this life that I'm livin' 
 I sit back and dream and them bitches come true 
 If I can do this shit tell me why can't you 
 I'm a regular motherfucker just like him or her them or they 
 Another southerner here to play from the volunteer state 
 Now we officially on the roster 
 Memphis legends won the oscar 
 No more waitin in line nowhere and personally I didn't win the oscar 
 But I still get all the perks the game has to fucking offer 
 New clothes, a lot of money so I'm fresh as a lobster 
 I could do this all day lay low and make a killin' 
 Project Pat please tell these motherfuckers how I'm feelin'
