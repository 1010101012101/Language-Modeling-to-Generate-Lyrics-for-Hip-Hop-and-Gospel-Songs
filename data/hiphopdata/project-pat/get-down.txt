I was wild with that *** in the streets 
 Tryna make a killin' off of *** and *** 
 You know how we get down, you know how we get down 
 You know how we get down, you know how we get down 
 I was wild with that *** in the streets 
 Tryna make a killin' off of *** and *** 
 You know how we get down, you know how we get down 
 You know how we get down, you know how we get down 
 They knew them K's was blazin', they knew they couldn't phase him 
 Roll through not to get chasin', look for prey to slay 'em 
 That's what we out here doin', Hardy Boy heads we bruisin' 
 Resist and you'll be losin', murder was the conclusion 
 Flossin' and flaugin' with flags, hit you with autos and mags 
 Run up on this here you'll crash and we ain't wearin' no mask 
 Strange to us an alien, warrin' like it's Rayleon 
 You, got reputation, dog you needs to pay me some 
 Cars it ain't no savin' 'em, broads we out here playin' 'em 
 Until that we go to jail, then we wanna stay with 'em 
 Kept the *** fired up, *** kept us wired up 
 If you is a shaky guy, you don't wanna ride with us 
 I was wild with that *** in the streets 
 Tryna make a killin' off of *** and *** 
 You know how we get down, you know how we get down 
 You know how we get down, you know how we get down 
 I was wild with that *** in the streets 
 Tryna make a killin' off of *** and *** 
 You know how we get down, you know how we get down 
 You know how we get down, you know how we get down 
 I had cheese, *** and a whole bunch of broads 
 Hydro ***, smoke and pistola in my draws 
 **** Do choke, scared of me like the laws 
 'Cause that gage I tote, blow they back through the walls 
 Well they never ever caught me, catch a bartee 
 You could ***, rather shortly, murder partee 
 Drankin', on a fo'ty, wanna cross me 
 Shot the boy in his face, now his brother want me 
 And my boys took it out of town, oh it's a collision 
 Nothin' to a gangsta, that ain't no decision 
 Seen 'em dippin' with them wankstas leavin' the club 
 Guerrilla *** in my system, a dangerous drug 
 My *** C he was drivin', they pulled on the E-way 
 Ballin' up behind them, I let lose the *** 
 Through the wind shield, rip steel, cut they heads off 
 On expressway seen a exit then we sped off 
 I was wild with that *** in the streets 
 Tryna make a killin' off of *** and *** 
 You know how we get down, you know how we get down 
 You know how we get down, you know how we get down 
 I was wild with that *** in the streets 
 Tryna make a killin' off of *** and *** 
 You know how we get down, you know how we get down 
 You know how we get down, you know how we get down
