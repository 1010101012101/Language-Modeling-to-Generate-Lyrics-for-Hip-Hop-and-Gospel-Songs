 Hen-Hen-O-Sin make a playa sin 
 Mix it in with that white and gin 
 Here we go again 
 Project Pat gotta keep a strap 
 Haters know I rap 
 Wanna shoot me in my gold teeth, blow me off the map 
 I attack like a shark would 
 Represent this hood 
 North Memphis, nigga Hollywood 
 Make it understand in my blood ain't no trakeness, or no fakeness 
 And no hoe couldn't break this 
 You can hate this 
 (Crunchy Blac) 
 Dis Bitch that bitch, nigga here's the deal 
 Crunchy ain't runnin' round' here fakin' deals 
 Crunchy runnin' round here tryna get a meal 
 Why you fakin' a deal, it don't cost nothin' to be real 
 All ya gotta do is keep that shit real 
 Don't be runnin' round here hollerin you got deals 
 Don't be runnin' round here hollerin that you'll kill 
 It don't cost nothin' to be real, but it costs when ya kill 
 (DJ Paul) 
 I'm bout to crash into you suckaz like the WORLD TRADE 
 I'm riding Green Escalade, full of green grenades 
 You hoez always hollerin that we be some bitches and shit, but every time I turn 
 Around you got our name on your shit 
 "I used to be with them mayne I'm still with them", you wish you was with them 
 How the fuck you hate them when you always claimin them? 
 I think it's funny cause y'all faggots be still calling my studio 
 Trying to get back, stay who you with 'cause I don't need ya hoe! 
 (La Chat)

 We packin mass case, and decoratin ya with bullet holes 
 La Chat I be ready you bustaz ain't got no reeds and shit 
 That leaves me no choice to grab my glock and go fucka wit 
 You speak killa talk, but ain't no killa in yo blood boi! 
 The infrared be beamin', I got this scope-a behind your door 
 You niggaz can't take it you hate the fact that we runnin' it 
 You ain't gotta love it, but you gon learn to respect it bitch! 
 (Lord Infamous) 
 Got some syrup in my cup, got some smoke in my mouth 
 Got some white in my nose, got your bitch on the couch 
 Got her head in my lap, trick I gotta keep it south 
 Got a problem with Three 6, gotta blow your brains out 
 Got that south sowed up 
 Got them guns loaded up 
 Fuckin' with the Scarecrow, that'll get ya blowed up 
 It's a hold up, Everybody fold up 
 Niggaz talk like they tough, but they ain't got no nutts... BITCH! 
 (Juicy J) 
 I'm shootin' a dike in her breasto 
 Coward in his chesto 
 And this police nigga/What we call em' Donnie Brasco 
 If you bitches want war, U can bring it, Let's go 
 When I put this tone in yo face (click) presto 
 A killa in a black coat 
 Goin' to make a mesto 
 Leave you in da street wit a bloody Willie Esco 
 Drankin' on some scotch, and we choppin' down that coco 
 Tryin' to roll some pot in a fuckin' optimol-doe 
 (Frayser Boy) 
 Don't you make the wrong move, and you'll get your ass killed dawg 
 A fake ass nigga, but he claimin that he real dawg 
 You ain't gotta lie to kick it actin' like you down dawg

 Don't you get smacked, and be gettin' off the pavement dawg 
 Don't you make me act a fool when somebody hatin' me dawg 
 Hypnotize Camp Posse got my fuckin' back dawg 
 Frayser Boy will leave you stankin pop you with that gat dawg 
 (Project Pat)
