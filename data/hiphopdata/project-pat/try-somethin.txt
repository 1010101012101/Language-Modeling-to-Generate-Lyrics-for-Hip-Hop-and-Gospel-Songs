Yeah it's Project Pat up in this 
 Representin' "Layin' the Smackdown", "North North" 
 Three 6 Mafia fin a rip it like it's supposed to be 
 Handle that shit 
 Jack one, smack one, run off wit ya sack son 
 Anybody wit the loot, give it up or I'ma shoot 
 Bow down M-town, niggaz like to ride clean 
 Snort on some good dope, smoke on some good green 
 Friday payday, so I'm at the Shake Junt 
 Lookin' fo' a big lick, fiendin' for a fat blunt 
 Saw my victim caught me one slippin' 
 On the side of the club takin' a pissin' 
 No mask on face I didn't really need it 
 He can be damn fool and he'll get heated 
 Point blank, snatch bank, runnin' like a track star 
 Heart pumpin' fast like I ate out the crack jar 
 No one saw me made clean getaway 
 That means that I still live to get paid 
 Late night, all night jackin on the spizot 
 Breakin up a dice game or where it's hizot 
 (I'm a rob me some niggaz) Mane I'm fucked up 
 A nigga gotta try something 
 (I'm a rob me some niggaz) Mane my lucks up 
 A nigga gotta try something 
 (I'm a rob me some niggaz) Mane I'm dead broke 
 A nigga gotta try something 
 (I'm a rob me some niggaz) Plus I'm out of dope 
 A nigga gotta try something 
 I ran up in the bank put a tone to his head 
 Told the clerk this a robbery nigga drop the bread 
 Then I ran like a bitch when my folks was outside 
 So I jumped in the car, mashed the gas start to ride 
 The westside of Tennesse, until I heard the news 
 Nigga should have went to Mexico, my face was on the tube 
 Most wanted for a felony I should have stayed in class 
 I was a stupid as nigga I didn't even wear a mask 
 I guess you know by now the BHZ do not play 
 My pussy valley are down and gonna spray 
 They still robbin' niggaz and jackin' fo yo clothes 
 And have you runnin' round like college girls exposed 
 My Tulane niggaz you knowin' they stayin' strapped 
 Beside DJ Paul they put The Haven on the Map 
 But it's too many hoods in The Haven to claim 
 So we gon all bring guns we gon' all bring pain. 
 You can do what ya do to keep ya ass in 
 It's CB and mane I ain't playin' 
 Wit pistol in my Muthafuckin right hand 
 I'm a stick it to ya body, and start demandin 
 Me muthafuckin money out ya fuckin' pockets 
 Give me them rings and that fuckin' watch 'n' you 
 Betta listen up before I start poppin' it's me again 
 I'm constantly robbin 
 Slap on his block wit the glock 
 And lock'em down to the rocks 
 Fiendin' for his knot in his pocket strip him 
 Down his socks, grab and feel this 44 
 Hopin' steam right off this scope 
 And I let him smoke If I go in ya pockets and ya broke 
 Ya got a lotta nuts rollin' my hood on ya twankies 
 Now ya gotta drop off them bitches and that ring on ya pankies 
 Either ya give me ya green, ya pills, and ya powda 
 Or I gotta pump the gauge and let you take a buck shot shower
