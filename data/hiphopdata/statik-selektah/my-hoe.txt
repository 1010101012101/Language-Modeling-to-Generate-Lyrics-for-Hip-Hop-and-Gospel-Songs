I'd do anything (anything) 
 Anything (anything) 
 Anything... niggas be out her hoein out 
 Oh yeah, rose and parades, my battle, my scar G rosa 
 Ice feel, how that feel? 
 You said it was about alien impulses all over yo poster 
 We postal phone ya, tell the show close the show 
 It's over it's like an old soldier with no model for tomorrow 
 I be thinking bout upholding my bottle 
 Plottin' on my Abe Lincoln, loadin hollows with my hands on the bottle 
 Throw a pistol like I'm middle eastern 
 Aye ink pins need revival, yo I'm not religious 
 The palm is which I put a song up in and gave me when he thought I pull 'em different 
 Mama's crib is safe, papa's crib safe 
 All my brothers and sisters know the color of my nickel plate 
 Still the haters wanna aks me how I deal with hate 
 Told 'em you should never look a pistol in the face 
 You just go the extra mile just to make sure that you're livin' it straight 
 You tell Barack I need a crib and estates 
 And cake niggas celebrate with you like an O chase 
 She stay hit yo crib just to get yo face up out my face 
 Fake nigga, how you picture tomorrow? 
 With the wrong frame of mind 
 How you picture love if you are blind? 
 And the crowd trippin' 
 You see I never called you my bitch or even my boo 
 There's so much in the name, it's so much more in you 
 My make you my 
 Shit! 
 You see I never called you my bitch or even my boo 
 There's so much in the name, it's so much more in you 
 My make you my 
 Shit! 
 It's crap day to day but I'm good enough on a bad day 
 Runnin' round my town without a sad face 
 Evidence make dough, moneys fat bills 
 Come realities back 
 No strikes back, no 
 Strike that 
 I snap till I'm done with my picks till it's sick 
 A pic's on 'em perfect as the person is fit 
 I lock a shot then I shoot to gift 
 I'm focusin', in dark rooms I develop the prince 
 So place your bets on he with 10th game fav 
 Flow is peace, the beam is stack, the light on the street is his 
 I'm the most west side of any west sider rider 
 Ridin' out by the beach until the day is complete 
 I won't stop, no can over the prop flow 
 I was snot nose kid, I had the potholes 
 In my lawn, I was bomic from dust 
 Then I grew the fuck up like I still dodge gestapos 
 You see I never called you my bitch or even my boo 
 There's so much in the name, it's so much more in you 
 My make you my 
 Shit! 
 You see I never called you my bitch or even my boo 
 There's so much in the name, it's so much more in you 
 My make you my 
 Shit! 
 Glass of champagne on a rosy carpet 
 The flow we sparked it like light to darkness, illuminating authors 
 Catch the eye, this upon Noah's Ark, 
 40 days and 40 nights, arose to port 
 Stars shinin the brightest 
 Rhythm unite us, bring us closer to the roads chose 
 Wise as my nigga pimp, bow to the signs of blimp 
 Readin 'the world yours', auderves etcetera 
 Treat her like a lady till yo cheddar up 
 Credible measures of competitors 
 It's laughable, I never was one 
 To see your efforts standing next to us 
 Had a few occasions on my exodus 
 When rappers thought that Rekka 
 Was the type to be stymied by nay sayers and hecklers 
 Heck of a rep, above the clowns, Inspectah Deck, I touch 
 Crowns with the intellect, probly there's an introspect 
 Crown me king to the death, karma bring bullet deaths 
 Then he got with me with the Henny breath 
 You see I never called you my bitch or even my boo 
 There's so much in the name, it's so much more in you 
 My make you my 
 Shit! 
 You see I never called you my bitch or even my boo 
 There's so much in the name, it's so much more in you 
 My make you my 
 Shit!
