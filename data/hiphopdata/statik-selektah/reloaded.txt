Okay, I'm reloaded! 
 Yes-yes, y'all, and you don't stop 
 Expect the unexpected, Brooklyn connected 
 Now, who's hot? Who's not? 
 Show off 
 Extended Play 
 Selektah Statik, we're back at it 
 It's in the paper 
 The flav's about to drop 
 Royal Blue Steve Harvey suits with army boots, hop in the Audi 
 We outtie, Queens County, call on the hounds 
 100 stacks on my favorite horse 
 300 hundred dollars for a flavored favorite broth 
 Keep it hidden in the neighbor's dog 
 So what the fuck is good? 
 Big Fucking Body 
 Back where it all started 
 Statik Selektah 
 Keep fucking around with me, you weak motherfucking DJ's 
 You'll be nothing less 
 You can't eat nothing more, man 
 You'll be lucky if I let you do a block party in the Bronx 
 You ain't shit 
 Fuck outta here, man 
 Move forward and we shine year round 
 New money, new bills, same shit, new design 
 So all you label execs 
 Cut the check, you now tuned in to Statik Selekt 
 Extended Play 
 Yeah, and it's live from Bushwick 
 Boom back rap, yep, back on that hood shit 
 Tone Touch, hold up, suckas get mushed quick 
 With all that fuckery, y'all can't fuck with me 
 Rolling still, overkill 
 Yeah, 50 emcees, y'all know the drill 
 Stay cooking up shit y'all supposed to feel 
 See I paved the way, then Statik saved the day
