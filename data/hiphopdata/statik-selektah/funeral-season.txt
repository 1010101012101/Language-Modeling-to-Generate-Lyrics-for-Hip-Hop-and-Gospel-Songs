Statik, wuddup? 
 Ghost 
 Did lot 
 Stone cold shooter, let the heater blow 
 Gun that a just main Twitter, follow the leader though 
 Up in the hood, homie askin, I got my Nina on 
 Just stood his eyes on some niggas that he needed gone 
 It's like that recorder, life ain't normal 
 If you die to shine then ice ain't for you 
 If the sky fall then the sky can't warn you 
 When your head crack the base don't warn you 
 Lightin up weed, pour that sour 
 In the streets in the mix like Kool Aid powder 
 Ride on them niggas, show 'em you ain't coward 
 Yeah you got family but you ain't ours 
 Get popped up, oxed up, or boxed up 
 Think it's a joke then bitch nigga done up up 
 'Cause I'm ghost and I'm still OG 
 This time I'm with Statik and it's real OG, wuddup? 
 Livin' rich or livin' poor 
 Funerals stay on schedule 
 This not season, can't stop the heatin 
 Funerals stay on schedule 
 All the G's is getting money and relaxin 
 But funerals stay on schedule 
 And I don't even care about the charges, invade federal 
 Funerals stay on schedule 
 I walk the cold streets of the city with big heaters 
 Ready for cats, there's no one up, they dick beat us 
 Yeah it's Big B, the trill OG walkin' 
 So keep yo mouth shut when the OG talkin' 
 If I want your opinion then nigga I'll beat it out of you 
 I'm real for the gunners bitch, I do on what I gotta do 
 And that's got a lot to do with where I was raised 
 Reach and old man in the trill where they roamin with K's 
 Always round with the gauge and they lurkin with meaners 
 Who will serve to get paid, committing more than misdemeanors 
 Once the while the shit you see my nigga do in his life 
 The average shit, there's no one on here every night 
 You can go to PA, till they beam all the yonkers 
 The young niggas wilin in the streets, going bonkers 
 Best thing I could do right now is pray for you 
 Just to narrow that pistol nigga to lay on you, hold up 
 Livin' rich or livin' poor 
 Funerals stay on schedule 
 This not season, can't stop the heatin 
 Funerals stay on schedule 
 All the G's is getting money and relaxin 
 But funerals stay on schedule 
 And I don't even care about the charges, invade federal 
 Funerals stay on schedule 
 For every nigga that say he proud of me 
 It's a nigga that's out for me 
 Feelin' like Martin Luther, I'm standin out on the balcony 
 Niggas used to be tough but I cut 'em off, call 'em equities 
 Niggas was in the fam with me, only niggas that dance with me 
 Bitches ain't wanna fuck, now they on and this for a chance with me 
 If you knew what that bass meant this is my fuckin' rhapsody 
 Feel like I'm a rhapsody, killin' it with my faculty 
 High up above the ground, I swear I'm defying gravity 
 Yeah I be younger but when I grow up I'mma buy me something 
 I always knew I'm like the psyche bluffin 
 Miss clear where the hustle, watch where I could see the future 
 We got bigger guns than dreams, little niggas will shoot ya 
 For no reason other than colors, he looked up to his brother 
 Now we layin beside him, too many tears for a mother 
 Too many story of hunger but fuck ya 
 If I must so I be out here in the streets tryna teach my niggas to come up, word 
 Livin' rich or livin' poor 
 Funerals stay on schedule 
 This not season, can't stop the heatin 
 Funerals stay on schedule 
 All the G's is getting money and relaxin 
 But funerals stay on schedule 
 And I don't even care about the charges, invade federal 
 Funerals stay on schedule
