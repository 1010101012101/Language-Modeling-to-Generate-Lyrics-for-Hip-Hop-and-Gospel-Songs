 "Bring 'em up dead" 
 We dump lead like a Brita 
 Mutate ninjas with shells, no Shredder, no Splinter 
 Hit you in the leg if you turn sprinter 
 We corner store bread winners, North Face in the dead of winter 
 Nose running, block hugging, snap a picture 
 I'll show you how to do this son 
 Turn a 8-ball into a pool table that'll fill up your pockets in six months 
 Twist blunts, wishing I could go back just once 
 Man I miss the old New York, I'll fuck around and get fronts 
 You kids front like you tough but you snitching 
 You'll do anything to get out of them cuffs like magicians 
 Everybody I dap will give anybody a nap 
 Have a crowd screaming "Wait/weight!" like everybody is fat 
 I joke about it because I lived it then I wrote about it 
 Flowed about it, hopped on stage, did some shows about it 
 But I'm not these rapper niggas, dog I'm so about it 
 Little argument, I probably hook that's how I go about it 
 Word though, I tell your bird whoa 
 Easy on the brain, slurp slow 
 Girl I'm swerving I don't want to hit the curb yo 
 That's the perks though, I get a couple bands 
 Ice flood a couple bands every time I let a verse go 
 I'm on a low-carb cheating 
 All this bread got these wolves eyeing mine but you be clinging to that?

 I'm from the home of the homeless, nobody wand is chromeless 
 Police try to regulate but we own this, fiends throw on loafers 
 Toes frozen sliding through the snow just to try and sell they sofas 
 Hocus pocus you disappear from all that smoking 
 Yellow white rock is more than potent, it's soul-controlling 
 And we in sole control, the more dough you fold 
 You scale that totem pole, the hoes grope your pole 
 The shooters on pay roll, you ready to rock 'n' roll 
 They ain't hopping out of patrol cars no mo' 
 But it ain't sweet nah 
 You graduated now them feds want to speak hah 
 What's wrong, cat got your tongue? 
 Well keep it shut or my alley cats'll scratch at ya gums 
 Do the crime, gotta eat that time soldier 
 Hang that up bad boy, slide time is over 
 I got roughed up by the roughers, fucked up motherfuckers 
 Escaped hopping them gates and scuffed up all my chuckers 
 And I'm still running but not from shit 
 I just been on a shitting run, they got run shit 
 You old ass niggas hating cause your son flipped 
 Whenever he hear that yaowa after the drum hit (yaowa) 
 Your slum bitch give you a cum kiss 
 I keep a bad young bitch that squirt, when I fuck her she cum piss 
 I tell shorty suck my soft dick and
