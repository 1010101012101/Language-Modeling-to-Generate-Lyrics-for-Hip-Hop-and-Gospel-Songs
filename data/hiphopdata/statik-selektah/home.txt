Okay, build it up 
 There's no place like home, there's no place like home 
 There's no place like home, there's no place like home 
 Let's go 
 Is there a heart in the house now? 
 Yeah, stand up 
 Yeah, I got a question 
 La la la la la la la 
 Good morning, so glad I got a home to record it 
 These houses people grew up in disrupted, they can't afford it 
 I hope you stay in the family for the son and for the daughter 
 They makin' you fork it over or forcing the foreclosure 
 When I'm torn I got a bunk but it's more like a coughin' 
 So the comfort of a home is important 
 Trust a lot more, would invest in the mortgage 
 If they can put it on rims drive to the club flossin' 
 This is the American dream 
 House, wife, kids and a dog, fight for 'em in the battle with force 
 Nobody win in this situation 
 Everything considered a loss 
 I grab a lemonade then sit on the porch 
 I'm writin' rhymes to the sounds of the birds chirping 
 Tellin' all stories in the first person 
 There's no place like home 
 There's no place like home 
 I'm writin' rhymes to the sounds of the birds chirping 
 Tellin' all stories in the first person 
 There's no place like home 
 There's no place like home 
 This is dedicated to places where fiends at 
 My crib, my lab, my pat and wherever I laid my hat 
 'Cause it's on, it's a box, the returner will underpass 
 It could be a beach for as long as the summer lasts 
 Home is what you make it, the place where you find your stuff 
 When you go in the block is hot, that's the side of your mind and heart 
 The heart is the house of love then so we build it up 
 It used to feel kinda empty until we filled it up 
 This ain't the living room 
 It's where we shell as the biggest room 
 Your cousin's on the couch, let me sit with you 
 You kids playin' in the yard, they as big as you 
 With yo twin of course, catch 'em in the kitchen with the food 
 Feelin' good, this is so essential 
 Watchin' the game with my pops and talkin' the fundamentals 
 So I'm swingin' for the fences, not just tryna get on base 
 My homeruns bring me back to this home place 
 I'm writin' rhymes to the sounds of the birds chirping 
 Tellin' all stories in the first person 
 There's no place like home 
 There's no place like home 
 I'm writin' rhymes to the sounds of the birds chirping 
 Tellin' all stories in the first person 
 There's no place like home 
 There's no place like home 
 Is there a heart in the house now? 
 Yeah, stand up 
 Stand up
