You ain't seen me for a minute, but I been here 
 Money getting longer like my chin-hair (my beard) 
 I sport the latest style of swim-wear 
 I wish I woulda know that life would've been this way 
 Then again, if I knew, then would I do it the same 
 Beamer Olive it's blue in the rain 
 Copped my man a matching six and now we two and the same 
 It's only right, right? Right 
 Everybody eating man (right) 
 But me first, I'm a hunter and I'm selfish 
 Dunk on Tim Duncan, 360Â° on ya bitch's face 
 Jump in the rental with the Maryland tags 
 Don't make me go inside the traveling bag 
 Come out the Chapel then, 
 Put my spoon inside the pudding in the ramekin 
 Leave you in past tense 
 All my bitches got accents, and big fat asses in a black Benz 
 Don't even call, 'cause I'm in Rome 
 Peace to all my fucking people locked up that should've been home 
 My whole life I was, running away 
 But now I run with the wind 
 Don't know what else they gonna say 
 But you keep running again 
 Money, glory, all I want 
 But now I'm riding 
 It all started with a little spark 
 The word is fucking bond 
 Check as I open my mind, and I open up my chakras 
 Perceiving in the light, as I'm focused through my optics 
 Third eye watching, stay open when I'm sleeping 
 Less sleep, more work, but I always stay dreaming 
 Life stays seeming like I'm drifting 
 "Stay scheming" niggas wanna slaughter my existence 
 But I stay shifting in different realities 
 And ask the higher Gods, change the channel 
 Like let me know, let me know what, let me know what it is 
 Let me tell 'em, let me tell 'em, what's wrong with the kids 
 Like a Pro-Era crew, wait, Joey Bad, who 
 Or Joe that blue like indigo hue 
 He's a indigo too, sent to lead the generation 
 Consciousness, awareness, and world domination 
 Face it, the government has been out to replace him 
 But every route's been miss-taken 
 My whole life I was, running away 
 But now I run with the wind 
 Don't know what else they gonna say 
 But you keep running again 
 Money, glory, all I want 
 But now I'm riding 
 It all started with a little spark
