Wolves out, baby 
 My barrel lean like thorazine 
 Like reverend king, cream like 
 Cartel spark reel, y'all in the mezzanine 
 Women at the shot ball, shot ball, guillotine 
 A hundred on the dot balls, black on the big machine 
 Blowing at your entourage, old squad, wolverines 
 Camouflage dons, spit hella steam, prophesize, picking out the lies 
 Gotta get the green 
 Backs in my nap sack, roll up a swisher 
 Sweet, light a splif, life's a bitch 
 Freaking off with the team, off the shit I've seen 
 Probably should be dead now 
 Fuck the zombies, smoke the bong, it's weed to the head now 
 It's the semi-auto going through your audio 
 My name is pressure and leave you in the poorest mode 
 Known movements, it's reality music, the gun law is 
 If you got one, you better use it 
 Listen, they pit convoes, see your way out before d jump over e 
 And if you want by the cheek so play silly, feel a 9 milly 
 Acting like you 'bout this life beef for really 
 Face fighting, wanna steal, y'all niggas kill me 
 Deer gang, 215, it's gucci philly 
 It's louis loaf with the smoke that beats that 
 Camouflage dons, zombies, static select 
 We present shots, we blowing off limbs 
 No sublimes, don't get it twisted, we knock them 
 It's a new wave, nwa, trick it how you want it, and it's all I got to say 
 The fame ain't changed me, I still don't fuck with you, niggas 
 I still be on the streets, I still scream fuck religion 
 I ain't scared of beef, get beacon, put on a skillet 
 You bigots are non-existent so fuck all my competition, hold up 
 Hoes haze, no competition, your mortal vision is sacrilegious 
 Painting vivid pictures, smoking with the same niggas 
 It's montana flow, whiter than the white cops that shot the kid on my block 
 I'm from a place where we rolling, we take it 
 Blow teeth, two foes, trap it in the basement 
 Two freaks, one me, it's threesomes in the am 
 Take a whiff, fold shit, four blunts in one bash 
 Bodies in the basement, homicide cases? 
 Prophesize about multiplying pot like we makers 
 Hater, you ain't on like the lakers 
 I know I'm wrong but we don't go, got this slave shit 
 Smith & weston, one bullet, your pick 
 Third lid, I be putting it in your bitch 
 Robbing like life after death, had a fourth disk 
 Rhyme like all eyes on me times four shit 
 Park place, sheet pins, smoking at the ball games 
 Scot bucks up top only when the knicks play 
 Sniffing with some fun, og and a swish play 
 Before you cross the day, motherfucker, look both ways 
 Motherfucker, look both ways 
 Motherfucker, look both ways 
 Camouflage dons, camouflage dons
