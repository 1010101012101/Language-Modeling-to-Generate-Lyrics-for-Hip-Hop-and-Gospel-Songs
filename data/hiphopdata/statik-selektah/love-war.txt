It ain't easy but I try 
 Every day is a constant battle 
 Oh to do right 
 To progress as a man 
 Or to fight 
 Statik Selektah 
 Uh, listen 
 Ayo it's hard not to kill niggas 
 Just like a full-time dog not to peel triggers 
 Bag up and move raw, tryin' to build figures 
 But I learned when it's hard you get a little bigger, the Lord is still with ya 
 Real spit so often I will get turned up 
 You're saucy and then you're corrupt 
 Just often and then return 
 I get this feeling up inside, it torture me and it burn up 
 I'm scorchin, it's like a furnace 
 It force me to get the burner but 
 I'm older and I'm smarter so I just turn a cheek 
 To the bullshit, knocked it off, I became a learner 
 If it ain't bout moving forward it don't concern us 
 But if you need lyrics to Lord then I'm at your service 
 Man I thought I lived the life real 'cause I like still 
 Kept the ice grill to see who face was meaner 
 But nowadays this negative energy could be so contagious 
 I gotta keep some space between us 
 Positive energy like a boomerang 
 I send it out, put it in God's hands and let him do a stand 
 No more tryin' to stress bricks to impress chicks 
 'Cause I just keep you in a box like some fresh kicks 
 I'm tryin' to be amongst the illest of rhymers 
 I'm no longer the kid who was fillin them 9's up 
 Wait, I gotta go and cop the steel and remind yous 
 Nah, I just kill 'em with kindness, spread love not war 
 Love war 
 This is love 
 Hell no, this is war 
 It's hard not to kill niggas 
 It's like a full-time job not to kill niggas 
 'Cause I'm a real nigga 
 I'm from where they leave bodies and pose the blood 
 Riddled with bullets like the hospital view niggas 
 No feel, nigga 
 Down the street from Richard 
 I only had a couple hundred thousands a night before the deal nigga 
 From the ville, nigga 
 A house niggas, you a house nigga, I'm a feel nigga 
 Always talk dramatic but I put down the ratchet and I 
 Got with Statik to build, nigga 
 Wise men build and destroy to build buildings 
 Crash a plane in your time will force a new beginning 
 And I hope you be in it 
 Have you on the nigga news, UPN and Channel 6, it's ya news 
 Then I break Seagal off the Compton cruise 
 Snatch my boy out until the one and good afternoon 
 I was told by one of the greatest that you got the best caine 
 Is can another throw it after you 
 Do what you can do like you can do 
 Them boys hate to boof you from the roof 
 Parts untangable, flows untenable 
 Y'all niggas can't kill me, your gun's unaimable 
 And love so long so bring the watcher 
 I done sent the engine with duck 
 Then snatch my soul, y'all can't clap the board 
 I keep cash, gave cost harassment case 
 Kids kidnap me, kids can get at me 
 And then keep straps on when them kids bring me back 
 They trap 'em and then they clap em 
 Dirtnap 'em and I still show 'em compassion 
 Order 'em caskets 
 Twitter they bastards, take 'em to classes 
 Get them they masters, dissin' on the Statik, let's go
