If you're under 21, you shouldn't listen to this 
 Black folks, crack smoke 
 Big head scientist, island of Patmos 
 Fake tears and stakes here 
 Crunching my thug 'cause I ain't shoot a nigga in 8 years 
 Sets a period 
 Period rex gettin' interior air 
 And you're living your death inferior 
 Listen, it's so thuggish to sniff 'caine 
 Make me cold-blooded, motherfucker, I'm Rick James 
 Hell of a drug, Sean Price, hell of a thug 
 Hang with Sheen, I got elephant blood 
 Listen to me, y'all better not listen to me 
 Fuck around and catch a case, tryinf to be like P 
 Listen, a ring on you brother, I'm harming you daily 
 Clown, Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey 
 P, now download this on a disk 
 If you're under 21, you shouldn't listen to this 
 Bitch 
 If you're under 21, you shouldn't listen to this 
 Phew, just made the cut baby 
 Let me light this motherfucking weed I'm smoking 
 Yeah, yeah yeah yeah 
 For real 
 Light the crack pipe so I know it's real 
 Whoa, young Bill Murray 
 I'm 21, but I feel 30 
 A little birdy out in Jersey 
 Said my raps were too wordy 
 Told his bitch to suck my dick and do a curtsy, dirty, slurpy 
 I smell earthy, puttin' curry on my turkey 
 I'm Blade 3, you're more Blades of Fury 
 Blonde dykes love me for my Klondike tummy 
 Getting all types of money, I'm with Sean Price, dummy, P 
 Polite stuntin' at a nice white luncheon 
 Met your wife, pipe plumbing, led to all night humping 
 Oh no, the end of your life coming 
 We the tribe, don't make me Phife something 
 My bitch from Beirut, she get loose 
 110 proof, call me Zeus, pussy tighter than a wet suit 
 Jesus Christ, he so nice 
 If you're under 21, you shouldn't listen to this
