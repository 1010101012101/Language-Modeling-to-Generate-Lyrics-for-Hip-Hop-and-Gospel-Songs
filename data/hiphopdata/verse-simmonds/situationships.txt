I know it's hard to see, that I care baby 
 And you're my number 1, cause I got 2 or 3 
 Im just keeping it real, I know your feelings deep 
 I know it's hard to speak, but I was busy last week 
 So my heart don't fail, That I said let's chill 
 You ain't going no where, I ain't going no where 
 Baby it's our world, and we make our own rules 
 As long as you never lie to me, imma never lie to you 
 Fuck 'em all day, fuck 'em all night 
 Shawty these are the moments that we liven for 
 Theyll never let her catch on you way down 
 But everybody got something to say 
 Take a hit of this and let's ride 
 And when you're homegirls say I ain't shit 
 Tell 'em don't worry about this

 Ain't nobody believe in love no more 
 And niggas don't dance in the club no more 
 We all crave attention not respect no more 
 And before the good girls niggas loving these hoes (hoe's winning) 
 Homegirl said it 
 Said it's been a couple years since she had a man 
 All these niggas trying to lay, they ain't trying to stay 
 All these niggas trying to play, they ain't trying to plan 
 And all these bad bitches turning up for their Instagram 
 Bust it open then complain my niggas trying to get at them 
 Thirsty niggas trying to fuck you all up in that (?) 
 Now she's spending money, now you all up at the ATM 
 None of my business, none of my business (yeah yeah) 
 (?) me and you a little different 
 Kept it real, right from the beginning (ah) 
 Fuck 'em all day, fuck 'em all night 
 Shawty these are the moments that we liven for 
 Theyll never let her catch on you way down 
 But everybody got something to say 
 Take a hit of this and let's ride 
 And when you're homegirls say I ain't shit

 Then she told me she ain't ready for a man in her life 
 She's too busy getting money, for a man in her life 
 Dream so big she can't even sleep in the night 
 She just want a real nigga, that can put the D in her life (consistent) 
 Cuz relationships are overrated 
 She just need one to hang with 
 So we can talk that body language 
 So come a little closer pull me in a little tighter 
 Cuz the rhythm in this bed put the room on fire 
 Baby tell me who these (...?) 
 Baby let me take you higher
