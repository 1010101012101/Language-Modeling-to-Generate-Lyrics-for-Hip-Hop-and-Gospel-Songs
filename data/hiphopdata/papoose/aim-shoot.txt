Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose 
 Longer than Pap, longer, longer than Pap 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Straight out the big apple it's Papoose and the Mobb 
 The apple was nothing without me like Steve Jobs 
 At the dice game, keep a mag on me 
 Why would I let another man ask bet me 
 I'm the best like Khaled, I bang if I should 
 A nigga gotta pay me if he throwin' ace in my hood 
 So the drug dealers wet work, beat all the pushers 
 When you was still in yo moms crib, eatin your boogers 
 I live the fast life, that's why I stay in a hurry 
 Papoose be killing the mic like Doctor Murray 
 King of New York, cop the caliber 
 My raps off the wall like a 2011 calendar 
 Why everybody out of character? 
 They all mad at me, I got 'em pissed like a catheter 
 Champion, I'm not ya challenger 
 Stop amateurs like the sandman, Banks how we handle em? 
 Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose 
 Longer than Pap, longer, longer than Pap 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose 
 Longer than Pap, longer, longer than Pap 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 I'mma carry the problem fixer, I wanna argue wit ya 
 Nigga you a target misser 
 The wrath of God will hit ya, with a horror picture 
 Call this rap takeout, you know Mobb deliver 
 Too hard for the hardest nigga, they fold like cardbord 
 Handle that now, nigga ain't no encores 
 ? A little heavy, so it leave the arm sore 
 Y'all want war, gave you what you starve for 
 All my shooters buy products of the worst recession 
 Aim for the dome and laugh when they purchase vests' 
 Cause that shit right there, is irrelevant 
 Niggas walk around here, with shit to kill a elephant 
 So your next move better be your best move 
 Like a chess move or get yo chest moved 
 'Cause when we come through you better have ya guns too 
 Cause all we do is *aim shoot* all we do is *aim shoot* 
 Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose 
 Longer than Pap, longer, longer than Pap 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose 
 Longer than Pap, longer, longer than Pap 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Back from hell, sorry I left you without no hard shit to step to 
 The drought is done, it's rain season 
 You can't stop my storm, you can't slow up my flow up nah (uh uh) 
 It's gonna pour cats and dogs 
 Thunder and lightning bolts, knock the lights off 
 When I black out make you miss me like 
 Nigga, where you been at? Word 
 Bout tired of the soft shit, it gets boring 
 They look like punks and act like a woman 
 You need danger, a little aggression 
 You need excitement I put a little pressure 
 Just to, balance things out, we're not the same 
 Some niggas is live, some niggas is lame 
 Some is real or some is fake 
 You draw the line in the sand, which side you claim? 
 Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose 
 Longer than Pap, longer, longer than Pap 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose 
 Longer than Pap, longer, longer than Pap 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Papoose, aim, shoot 
 Yayo got the whopper, it spit longer than Papoose 
 Longer than Pap, longer, longer than Pap
