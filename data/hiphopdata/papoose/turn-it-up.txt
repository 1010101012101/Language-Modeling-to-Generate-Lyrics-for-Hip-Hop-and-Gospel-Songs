Ayo Premier wussup man? 
 (Wussup Paps?) 
 Live from the Nacirema Dream 
 Papoose and DJ Premier 
 Yeah 
 Time to turn it up on these niggas man 
 Il Primo, you ready to turn it up? 
 (You know it) 
 Let's turn it up on em 
 We never heard of yo clique but they heard of us 
 They put 'em down, we liftin them burners up 
 You keep sayin' word to your mother but word to what? 
 I don't give a fuck about none of these niggas 
 I turn it up, 
 Come on, come on, killas 
 Here go my cup, give me some more liquor 
 Open this back window, let me dump on niggas 
 It's my era, I'm bout to turn it up on niggas 
 Peace to the New York Knickerbockers, the plot got thicker 
 'Cause now they got the Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center 
 Hello Mrs. and Mr., cousins, brothers and sisters 
 Ladies and gentlemen, children prisons of finger printers 
 Snakes who like to slither, wolves, monkeys, gorillas 
 Veterans and beginners, righteous people and sinners 
 Gamblers, losers and winners, ice grillers and grinners 
 Hope you all some good swimmers 'cause I'm as deep as the river 
 I'm the bad guy, just like the Joker and Riddler 
 Bad as Mike in his prime, man in the mirror in Thriller 
 You ain't a real man, you can't even use the shitter 
 You a pussycat, you probably got kitty litter 
 Kill rich niggas in chinchilla 
 Representing for the wig-splitters and skid bitters who gets realer 
 Like Beenie Man, carjack a bitch nigga 
 Who got the keys to the Jeep? Sim Simmer 
 We never heard of yo clique but they heard of us 
 They put 'em down, we liftin them burners up 
 You keep sayin' word to your mother but word to what? 
 I don't give a fuck about none of these niggas 
 I turn it up, 
 Come on, come on, killas 
 Here go my cup, give me some more liquor 
 Open this back window, let me dump on niggas 
 It's my era, I'm bout to turn it up on niggas 
 When my oral deliver it's such a moral dilemma 
 I don't quarrel with quitters, I give 'em sorrow and shimmers 
 You think your artists is iller just cause his car from the dealer? 
 This music char is bitter, cause y'all some horrible spitters 
 When I swallow the liquor, I write a marvelous scripture 
 Start drawing a picture 'cause I'm immortal my nigga 
 Beef is played out so I don't bother with niggas 
 But as long as it's tender I eat your squad up for dinner 
 Put my palms on the trigger and shoot you all in yo liver 
 Injure all of you niggas, I'm cool and calm as a killer 
 Your man styling from fingers, man who are you? Vanilla 
 Ice - I'm Suge Knight, hang 'em off the balcony with ya 
 Since I deserve scrilla, I learned to flip birds quicker 
 Had to hit curves with the hustlers and to emerge richer 
 Back when Dipset was sippin sizzurp nigga 
 My jewelery was black and yellow just like the Pittsburgh Steelers 
 We never heard of yo clique but they heard of us 
 They put 'em down, we liftin them burners up 
 You keep sayin' word to your mother but word to what? 
 I don't give a fuck about none of these niggas 
 I turn it up, 
 Come on, come on, killas 
 Here go my cup, give me some more liquor 
 Open this back window, let me dump on niggas 
 It's my era, I'm bout to turn it up on niggas 
 I'm on that money train, making dead president stops 
 Robbed the liquor store just so we can get some Ciroc 
 Ate Corn Flakes, no Fruity Pebbles and Pops 
 Got chased by the stray dogs when I fled though the block 
 Bought a 50-cent razor, now I'm ready to rock 
 I step to your block with a George Jefferson bop 
 I cut him cross peddle bike, he bled to his socks 
 'Cause Miles didn't have a chain when I peddled and popped 
 My leather bomber was better than that pleather you rocked 
 I wore old bomber way before Michelle and Barack 
 I heard up North you wasn't reppin a lot 
 You never caught a 10-3, you respected the cops 
 How you gon use that jail shit to try to get to the top? 
 You woke up in PC, never slept in a box 
 He said he hungry so I fed him the ox 
 My gun is like an independent record label, Heckler and Koch 
 We never heard of yo clique but they heard of us 
 They put 'em down, we liftin them burners up 
 You keep sayin' word to your mother but word to what? 
 I don't give a fuck about none of these niggas 
 I turn it up, 
 Come on, come on, killas 
 Here go my cup, give me some more liquor 
 Open this back window, let me dump on niggas 
 It's my era, I'm bout to turn it up on niggas 
 Turn up 
 Now I come back 
 Keep it underground hardcore 
 Turn up 
 Now I come back 
 Keep it underground hardcore 
 Turn up 
 Now I come back 
 Keep it underground hardcore 
 Turn up 
 Papoose, Papoose
