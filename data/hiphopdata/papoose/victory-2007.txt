If I made a title that offend the whole industry 
 Would y'all all say my title in your interviews? 
 If I came out dissin everyone of y'all 
 Would I sell as much records as these other dudes? 
 If I said I was retiring but never left 
 Woulda y'all all show me love when I came back? 
 If I ran the streets for the past two years 
 Would you respect me or would yousay fuck pap? 
 Yo where my thugs at? 
 Cock ya guns back 
 My headphones ain't loud yo turn up the track 
 Ok bump that 
 Homie I run rap 
 I add on to the game you niggas subtract 
 Yo where my bloods at? 
 Throw it up blat 
 Yo where my cause at? 
 He cut you come back 
 They said they tough cats 
 But they some rugrats 
 I drop 'em off on the block and make them pump packs 
 Only a couple stacks 
 He tried to duck pap 
 I sent a shot at his ass 
 And told him duck that 
 x2: 
 Ayo bump that 
 Bump this 
 Stay hot 
 What's this 
 He broke 
 He rich 
 Homie we run this 
 This a new era 
 Your heart bumpin in fear 
 2007 the god number? is here 
 The stronger I become the more y'all weaken 
 So when I'm at full power your gonna be a weaklin 
 My heart still beatin' and my lungs still breathin 
 My brain still thinkin' ain't none of y'all eatin 
 Over my dead body and my blood still bleedin 
 I'm a rap rebel 
 Clap a black metal 
 Look into my eyes and realize what pap symbol 
 Lies but wise got pride is that visual 
 Nah I don't slap high five with you 
 (?) 
 It's not my vibe 
 You just not my size 
 I cock my 9 
 Cats got 9 lives get shot 5 times 
 I cock pistols and blast clap missles 
 Black it's that simple 
 x2: 
 Bump that 
 Bump this 
 Stay hot 
 What's this 
 He broke 
 He rich 
 Homie we run this 
 This a new era 
 Your heart bumpin in fear 
 2007 the god number? is here 
 The cops keep printin me each of them bums 
 Bendin at my index finger and squeezin my thumb 
 I'm lookin' at him hoping he get it done 
 The new printing machines in the precent is dumb 
 Through the speakers I come 
 With the weed in my lungs 
 You ever ran into ya enemy deep in the slums? 
 They scheming on you 
 And you schemin on them 
 Then you realize the nigga who you be with is one 
 Hell of a big pussy why you beefin with son? 
 He keep tappin you tellin' you they reached for a gun 
 But he lying just lookin' for a reason to run 
 Ever catch you on the block? 
 I beat you like them African boys be beatin' them drums 
 Why would I start eating with them and they starvin 
 Might as well say I'm feeding these bums 
 I don't like them niggas 
 I be talking greasy to them 
 They say pap a slick talker 
 That boy got grease on his tongue 
 I'm the real beast from the east and I'm not done 
 The most official spitting the swift musician 
 That's if you listen 
 It's a simple mission at his? it's his decision 
 Cause my intuition end a vision 
 It's benefiting all my men and women 
 Who do it big in a mental prison 
 But if you wishing to get the griping since you tripin 
 We gon blast till it's the end of class 
 With quick collision 
 Cut you from ear to ear 
 Give incisions 
 Eat your food like it's nutrition 
 (?) 
 I can give you wisdom 
 'Cause it's tradition 
 But if you dissing 
 I can switch positions 
 (?) 
 I don't care if it's linen or if it's denim 
 I grip the lemon 
 Squeeze hit 'em my enemies 
 Rip 'em with venom in em 
 Likely to hit the ism after I send you spinnin
