You want answers? 
 I think I'm entitled! 
 You want answers?! 
 I want the truth! 
 You can't handle the truth! 
 If ya fake, ya fake! 
 (Fake, fake) 
 If ya wack, ya wack! 
 (Wack, wack) 
 If ya hot, ya hot! 
 (Hot, hot) 
 Most of you rap cats 
 Don't appeal to me 
 A lot of you say you keeping it real 
 But you ain't real to me 
 Mac 10, Ice Cube, W.C 
 You niggers make me laugh 
 Y'all belong on W.B 
 Coolio is so whacky, it's disgusting 
 Most rappers on the West Coast 
 Don't even like you 
 Trust me 
 And E-40 I gotta talk about you 
 Your style's so annoying 
 I just wanna smack the shit out you 
 And Snoop? 
 I don't know where to begin 
 There should be a sin 
 To be a millionaire and be so thin 
 But on the real 
 When you first got the deal 
 You was the man 
 I swear to god Snoop 
 I used to be your fan 
 What happened? 
 Now everything you make sucks 
 Now you're just like all these 
 Other commercial dumb fucks 
 MC Ren? 
 I respect you kid 
 But your style kinda died (with Easy E in it) 
 If ya fake, ya fake!

 Foxy Brown? 
 Who the hell gave you that name? 
 I saw you in Harlem 
 You looked like a dude 
 Fuck game 
 It's a shame tryin' to 
 Gain fame as a hoe 
 You the same as the other hoes 
 That came in the 
 Game for the dope 
 And Nore I never liked you and Capone 
 But I can't fund on your album 
 You sound better alone! 
 And I don't really mean to diss you 
 'Cause you really seem cool 
 But most of your rhymes 
 Sound like you never finished school 
 DMX? 
 No doubt you got a rap soul 
 But the way you stress 
 Your the best 
 But your head is a little too blown 
 You kill me with all that dog barking 
 Gimmick-crap 
 Carice one already put a song 
 About gimmicks on the map 
 Cannibus you rack hot, 97 
 On a scale from one to ten 
 We all said 11 
 DMX got a 9 
 Nore a 6 
 I'm glad you left Wyclef alone 
 'Cause you cats didn't mix 
 Mase you came real 
 With DMX and Alocks 
 But now 
 You sound more in beef 
 Than Devil Cocks 
 You represent Harlem 
 But Harlem don't respect you 
 And if those rumors are true 
 You better get someone else protect you!

 Will Smith? 
 Now you know damn well 
 The only air you belong on 
 Is the one in Bell 
 Even though I don't like you 
 I don't hate you 
 I hate when award shows let you win 
 And nonetheless nominate you 
 Onxy? 
 I love y'all 
 But I gotta pull your card 
 You gotta be soft 
 'Cause you act too hard 
 Big Daddy Kane? 
 I get rolled off the mobe 
 But you sober 
 When you came out with that black 
 Beautiful in the bone 
 You hurt me 
 And most of your fans 
 I'm glad you back out 
 And keepin' it real 
 Please keep it in your plans 
 Charlie Baltimore 
 You need more than just luck 
 'Cause you suck 
 And I really mean you suck! 
 Cameron? 
 Your first joint was off the hook 
 And I liked a lot of songs off your album 
 But look 
 Horse N' Carriage 
 Fuck me up 
 That shit was wack 
 And the remix 
 Had nothing to do 
 With that track 
 But I don't blame you 
 Believe me 
 I know the game 
 Record labels 
 Holly Gift Creative controlling it 
 Is a shame! 
 Look at McCgruff his album was a hike 
 But the cats he sounded with 
 Didn't even put the shit right!
