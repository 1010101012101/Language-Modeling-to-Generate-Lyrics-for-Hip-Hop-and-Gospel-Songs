Yeah (Yeah) 
 Papoose (Papoose) 
 I wanna give a big shoutout to Da Riffs! (Shoutout to Da Riffs!) 
 Keep producing that fire! (That fire! That fire!) 
 Let's go! (Let's go!) 
 'Cause when it all begins 
 My eyes on the prize so it's on again 
 I refuse to lose I ain't gon pretend 
 I thought I told you I was born to win 
 Everybody loves a winner! 
 Victory I choose 
 Ain't no turning back 'cause I paid my dues 
 I tighten up my laces when I tie my shoes 
 Born to win, I refuse to lose 
 Everybody loves a winner! 
 My adrenaline rushing through my veins 
 Next stop is victory, it's rushing like a train 
 I'm determined to win, cause there's nothing like the pain of defeat 
 I refuse to remain incomplete 
 Gotta lot of stamina 'cause I train for some weeks 
 Got my strength from the vitamins and the grains that I eat 
 All obstacles overcame, I'm unique 
 I started from the bottom, see I came from beneath 
 The sky's the limit so I'ma raise to my peak 
 Winning is everything, let me explain what think 
 Practice makes perfect, so when working I don't relax 
 I practice a lot, therefore I'm perfect and that's a fact 
 Been through some hard times while the burner was on my back 
 It was rough, but I was determined so I adapt 
 Gettin' what I'm deservin, holla back 
 Game over you lost like a person with outta map 
 Everybody loves a winner! 
 'Cause when it all begins 
 My eyes on the prize so it's on again 
 I refuse to lose I ain't gon pretend 
 I thought I told you I was born to win 
 Everybody loves a winner! 
 Victory I choose 
 Ain't no turning back 'cause I paid my dues 
 I tighten up my laces when I tie my shoes 
 Born to win, I refuse to lose 
 Everybody loves a winner! 
 My competition said I wasn't ready to face him 
 My teammates said 'I think we need to replace him' 
 All the haters used to say 'Boo we hate him' 
 I wanna thank y'all for the inspiration 
 Waited a long time for my time I'm anxious 
 Something like a doctor, 'cause I got patients 
 May the best man win, the worst man lose 
 Last man no choice, the first man choose 
 I was born as a leader, that's what I gotta be 
 I don't follow rules, I let the rules follow me 
 I'ma focus man on the lose, animal out the cage 
 An ambitious and vicious champion with a rage 
 What's the difference between a champion and a challenger? 
 A champion already conquered his caliber 
 You tryna become, a champion became 
 I got more wins then a hurricane 
 Everybody loves a winner! 
 'Cause when it all begins 
 My eyes on the prize so it's on again 
 I refuse to lose I ain't gon pretend 
 I thought I told you I was born to win 
 Everybody loves a winner! 
 Victory I choose 
 Ain't no turning back 'cause I paid my dues 
 I tighten up my laces when I tie my shoes 
 Born to win, I refuse to lose 
 Everybody loves a winner! 
 That's why I eat finer foods 
 Complete wiser moves, I'ma retire you 
 No remmorce for these tired dudes 
 Let's celebrate the victory, I won like three minus two 
 Its only what you make it that's what we gotta remember 
 But deep down inside everybodies a winner 
 You gotta work hard January till December 
 Finish what you start and you can be a contender 
 Watch the man in the mirror, look into your inner 
 Self, maintian health and never be a quitter 
 Gotta shine like the sun, flow like the river 
 You see a chance to win then take it like a picture 
 I ain't tryna preach to you don't feel bitter 
 I'm just tryna tell you what it take to be a winner 
 He's a champion 'cause it's impossible to stop him 
 Victory is a option 
 Everybody loves a winner! 
 'Cause when it all begins 
 My eyes on the prize so it's on again 
 I refuse to lose I ain't gon pretend 
 I thought I told you I was born to win 
 Everybody loves a winner! 
 Victory I choose 
 Ain't no turning back 'cause I paid my dues 
 I tighten up my laces when I tie my shoes 
 Born to win, I refuse to lose 
 Everybody loves a winner!
