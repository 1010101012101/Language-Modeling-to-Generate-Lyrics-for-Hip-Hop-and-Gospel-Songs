Sound like it's gonna be a hot summer, cool off 
 I told you I got 'em... Papoose, Pa-poose 
 I'm gettin' money everyday 'cause I'm like that 
 I wear my jewelry anyway 'cause I'm like that 
 I drive a Cadillac truck 'cause I'm like that 
 I don't give a flyin fuck 'cause I'm like that 
 That dude ain't like that, he ain't like that 
 They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that 
 That nigga ain't like that, he ain't like that 
 They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that 
 They aight! 
 I told y'all I'm like that 
 They said I fell off, tell 'em I'm right back! 
 I drove in the industry in the white 'lac 
 Back then, only two niggas was nice scrap 
 If you wasn't screamin "Squad up!" just like Stack 
 You was screamin "Thug-a, thug-a, thug-a!" just like Pap 
 In your ear like a Q-Tip where Phife at?! 
 Though you said you was a rider man where's your bike at?! 
 I like a bucket naked bitch with nice tatts 
 Earrings with the hoops in 'em just like Shaq 
 'Bout to put Knicks in the strip where Spike at?! 
 Do your homework shots fly when I strike back 
 I spit fire like Satan when I rap 
 Got the Jesus piece if you wonder where Christ at? 
 I hustle like the snowman, your girl your loan fam 
 She show the ta ta's I ain't talkin' about Hulk man 
 I'm gettin' money everyday 'cause I'm like that (Yeah!) 
 I wear my jewelry anyway 'cause I'm like that (Ha Ha Ha!) 
 I drive a Cadillac truck 'cause I'm like that (Uh!) 
 I don't give a flyin fuck 'cause I'm like that (Fuck 'em!) 
 That dude ain't like that (Nah!) he ain't like that (Uh oh!) 
 They ain't like that (Nope!) them niggas ain't like that (Eh heh!) 
 That nigga ain't like that (Nah!) he ain't like that (Uh oh!) 
 They ain't like that (Nah!) them niggas ain't like that (Uh!) 
 They aight! 
 Yeah! Yo! Uh! I'm like that! 
 My transporter always get that white back 
 (Make sure the couch right to catch that flight back) 
 Addicted to the same medication as Mike Jack! 
 (Old school high top Air's with the Nike strap) 
 We don't want your bitch dog come get your wife back 
 (Money in the safe keep the dough where the rice at) 
 Who advised you?! Where you get your advice at?! 
 (Never get the eat the whole pie you gotta slice that) 
 Lil' paper you spit nigga we spit twice that 
 (For you it's like a mill but for us it's a life snack) 
 Drive by, shoot shit up in the white Acc' 
 (Niggas used to steal on you, you wouldn't fight back) 
 But bitch actin' tough you should be where the dykes at 
 (Like Cushi in Casino put your hand where the vice at) 
 You eyeballs will pop out, and you won't like that 
 ('Cause you ain't like that!) 
 I'm gettin' money everyday 'cause I'm like that 
 I wear my jewelry anyway 'cause I'm like that 
 I drive a Cadillac truck 'cause I'm like that 
 I don't give a flyin fuck 'cause I'm like that 
 That dude ain't like that, he ain't like that 
 They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that 
 That nigga ain't like that, he ain't like that 
 They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that (Uh! 2 Chainz!) 
 They aight! 
 Yeah! Rastafarian ridin' in a Delorean 
 Back To The Future so you niggas better Oregon 
 Duck when I'm approachin, aim ain't good 
 But I got enough rounds to hit you and your closest friend 
 You know I roll 'em in, throw 'em in, kick 'em out 
 Laid back, every room got a fuckin' different couch 
 Everyday I'm smokin' on a different ounce (Yeah!) 
 Every mill I make I buy a fuckin' different house 
 And they aight 
 Got three girlfriends and they all dykes 
 We all high, S.O.S. Swag on site 
 Yeah It's like that, did my thang 
 Brought that white back 
 Get that cheese, don't get scared of that mice trap 
 Rrrah! Alot of rounds kill 'em with the muffled sound 
 Still an underdog puttin' niggas underground 
 I'm gettin' money everyday 'cause I'm like that 
 I wear my jewelry anyway 'cause I'm like that 
 I drive a Cadillac truck 'cause I'm like that 
 I don't give a flyin fuck 'cause I'm like that 
 That dude ain't like that, he ain't like that 
 They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that 
 That nigga ain't like that, he ain't like that 
 They ain't like that, them niggas ain't like that 
 They aight!
