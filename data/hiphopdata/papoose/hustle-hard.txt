(Feat. 50 cent) 
 (Chorus x4: 50 cent) 
 Hustle Hard 
 Money Stack 
 Sell that dope 
 Sell that crack 
 Sell that pat 
 Sell that gat 
 Sell that pussy 
 Holla back 
 (Verse 1: Papoose) 
 Listen if you eightball shavin' onthe block turn 7 grams to 14 grams you gotta (Hustle Hard) 
 Turn 14 to 28 fast 
 56 to 100 grams 
 Now I'm on yo ass (Hustle Hard) 
 And I ain't stoppin' at a hundred grams 
 A hundred grams to a hundred grand 
 Let's take it back to the gutter fam 
 I ain't shaking none of you suckas hands 
 Because I'm better than you, you, him, and your other man 
 They need no brown when they makin' them sucka jams 
 But they get on the radio and turn to the gutterman 
 You and your R&B boss make a good couple fam 
 I'ma catch you at lover's lane like Son of Sam 
 Got the revolver in my fuckin' hand 
 Automatics like that hot 97 concert summer jam 
 Half of my work, make samples to keep em' comin' fam 
 I sample 50 like I just copped a hundred grams 
 (Chorus x4: 50 cent) 
 Hustle Hard 
 Money Stack 
 Sell that dope 
 Sell that crack 
 Sell that pat 
 Sell that gat 
 Sell that pussy 
 Holla back 
 (Verse 2: Papoose) 
 At age 7 this nigga tried to sell me 6 
 You can't jerk me I got more scales than fish 
 Nigga's mad 'cause they can't make a sell for shit 
 When I'm on the block I make more sales than Sprint 
 Gone have to bust yo gun if you bust my ballz 
 This nigga owe me some money tryin' to duck my callz 
 Follow them up the oneway street he smokin' on a loosay 
 He seen me and tried to bust a U-way 
 So I caught him on a 2-way Street and gripped on a oozay 
 I ain't have a sidekick but I hit em' on a 2-way 
 Brought 10 nigga's who thought they'd never see you breathless 
 Well that's somethin' that Tennessee like Memphis 
 Rappers be tryin' to get in where they fit in like tetris 
 That's why I Ieave they family 'morning' like 'breakfast' 
 They see other niggaz do it and then they try to follow 
 That's why I leave they family 'mourning' like 'alonzo' 
 (Chorus x4: 50 cent) 
 Hustle hard 
 Money stack 
 Sell that dope 
 Sell that crack 
 Sell that pat 
 Sell that gat 
 Sell that pussy 
 Holla back 
 (Verse 3: Papoose) 
 I lead the rifle raw 
 You just went right through your final door 
 I invite you all 
 Never did like you or trifle fraud 
 Sick as psycho wards 
 Invite you on buyin' my mike recital was vinyl 
 Shine a light that'll blind you 
 My Light that'll fight for your title 
 Cry for psysem like michael 
 My life recycle is psycho da pschobanktual bible 
 Look in the eyez of your idle 
 I'm right behind you 
 I Lined you 
 I Stifled yours 
 You rap niggaz marked for death like Michael Moore (Hustle hard) 
 Yeah even my rhymes is hustle 
 I'm sellin' em' to your mind watch my respect double (Hustle hard) 
 They never used to wanna produce him or introduce him 
 Gettin' Text's from niggaz who rappin' 
 Text messages from niggaz who producin' 
 Now a days I get more Texas than Houston (Hustle hard) 
 Ha you ain't doin' no real bubblin' 
 You keep your end of the street stop air hustlin' 
 (Chorus x4: 50 cent) 
 Hustle hard 
 Money Stack 
 Sell that dope 
 Sell that crack 
 Sell that pat 
 Sell that gat 
 Sell that pussy
