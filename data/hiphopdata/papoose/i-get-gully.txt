I get gully, I-I get gully, I -I -I get, I get, iget 
 Pap poose papoose remix 
 I get gully bust a shot... I - I grip it 
 I get gully bust a shot... I - I grip it 
 I get gully bust a shot... bust bust a shot bust bust a shot 
 My gun go off...(shots fired) 
 I get gully bust a shot... I - I grip it 
 I get gully bust a shot... I - I grip it 
 I get gully bust a shot... bust bust a shot bust bust a shot 
 My gun go off... 
 I had the quarter water when I was young, stepped it up, not a juice, the 2- 5, u dumb fuck 
 Pull a 80 on me baby, who you think scared 
 I take the gun in the club, man I bring it everywhere 
 I load the clip, I don't play when I got that fifth 
 Bed-stuy up in this bitch, yeah I smell like eros, 
 Who wanna be a hero, put a hole in you 'bout the size of a zero, I was over seas where the haze is legal, 
 Get high, I'm already that, clip I'm a empty that 
 Thugga cated from the stuy, hit you right between the eyes 
 Call that gun talk, I really bust off 
 The home attendant wash you up 
 Super pick the garbage up 
 Loco when I bust 
 You maric√≥ns better duck 
 You don't want it in the streets 
 I get busy in the city, I come where you eat 
 Capice 
 I get gully bust a shot... I - I grip it 
 I get gully bust a shot... I - I grip it 
 I get gully bust a shot... bust bust a shot bust bust a shot 
 My gun go off...(shots fired) 
 I get gully bust a shot... I - I grip it 
 I get gully bust a shot... I - I grip it 
 I get gully bust a shot... bust bust a shot bust bust a shot 
 My gun go off... 
 You can call this a freestyle, I say it's a remix 
 My name papoose, nicest nigga on the street 
 Shit first it was the tech nine, then the mac 90 
 The starting me, but pardon me, I keep grippin em 
 U can call me Mr. Mackey, my pants stay baggy 
 Hit ya click up, make um do that aunt jackie 
 Chicken-noodle, moonwalk, electric slide, shoot-off 
 Smurf'en and whop'in, who wan get it poppin' 
 I was young I used to rob them, now they wanna rob me 
 Catch me slippin, oh no no not me 
 Homie why you schemin, I'll leave you leanin 
 I'm so relentless when lettin that cannon go 
 No bandana but I bang like rambo 
 Shoot you with my right hand, hit you and ya hypeman 
 Homie calm down you talkin' too loud 
 Matter a fact I'm reaching for my gun right now...(gun shot in the background)
