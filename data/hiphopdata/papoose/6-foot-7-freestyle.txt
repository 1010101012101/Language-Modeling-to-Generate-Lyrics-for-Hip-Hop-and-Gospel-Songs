Papoose papoose 
 I'm the greatest ever 
 Cakeing hella chasing devils wave beretas 
 Making fellas face dilemmas 
 Bake'em down to Satan seller 
 Man I get it shaking with a rapper bet you they surrender 
 Stomp'em with the male ugg boots you can taste the leather 
 Let dice shake with tremors bet u I can try'em better 
 Headcrack ace'em never uh uh pay the cheddar 
 Master what you ain't remember 
 Champion like a lakers member 
 Colder than a late December 
 Hit the bank 'n' shake the teller 
 Your girl be chasing niggas say she needs a babysitter 
 Sending me them naked pictures return straight to sender 
 Coming with a straight vendetta 
 You about as fake as ... 
 Banging since I play with sega 
 Eating since the regan era 
 Man I'm of the wall like street fighter play with vega 
 Got the nickel play whatever 
 You a bird ill flame your feathers 
 I'm the crime ... better find their protector 
 Run'em over on the track shoulda shine they reflectors 
 I'm a wise brave inventor brooklyn mindstate projector 
 Quick to vibrate your section 
 Make the migrate respect us 
 Ever violate the mecca of the rhyme stays professor 
 Ill apply a place to pressure then annihilate your lecture 
 We tri state profectors with some high rate investors 
 While them guys pay for pleasure 
 We arrive take the treasure 
 Mush your pop face heffa off a sky scrapper 'n' tell her you should try praying for better like the guy mase 'n' betha 
 I'm the ... day collector redefine the face of terror 
 Bring the helicopters out make'em fly they propellers 
 Life is like a game of chess while you guys playing checkers 
 Hesitate to smoke a dutch if the kind ain't Vanilla 
 Hustling bustling struggling juggling doubling 
 He's blundering mumbling fumbling 
 Suckers is stuttering 
 The ruckus I brung you is tuff as a puzzle is puzzling 
 Busting your bubble you stuck in a huddle they huddling 
 He rough and he mellow a thug or he thorough they wondering 
 Come to the burrel is such a rebudle ill muscle'em 
 Catch you on fulton 'n' franklyn ill touch you and tuck it in 
 Come off the shuttle and run threw the tunnel I'm trouble son 
 Cutchu your blood in a puddle so sudden is floodering in front of your mom ... with a slug is discoloring 
 This grave is for you 
 I dug wit a shovel and shoved'em in 
 Death is become to you 
 Your soul is above you is hovering 
 Blood on my chucks he buckled 
 I chuckle I'm chuckleling 
 I'm humble revenge I love you 
 He stumble I punished him 
 Your bones can tumble I'm thunderous 
 Since you say you wanna rumble in the jungle 
 The jungle go fucking ...
