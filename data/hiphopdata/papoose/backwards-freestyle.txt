"I was outside chilling in my house 
 It was nighttime so the sun was out 
 I drunk my food and ate my water 
 In the middle of the block, standing on the corner 
 Some pregnant man went into labor 
 This illiterate dude was reading the newspaper 
 All of that liquor must've got me high 
 It was raining outside so the ground was dry 
 Two non-violent dudes started to fight 
 He reached in his pocket and shot 'em with a knife 
 The dude came back and stabbed him with a gun 
 The man in the wheelchair started to run 
 You couldn't even hear it it was so damn loud 
 The cats started barking the dog said 'meoow' 
 Uh oh somebody must've called the cops 
 I guess the deaf man must've heard the shots 
 If you don't believe me my storys true 
 Ask the blind man he saw it too"
