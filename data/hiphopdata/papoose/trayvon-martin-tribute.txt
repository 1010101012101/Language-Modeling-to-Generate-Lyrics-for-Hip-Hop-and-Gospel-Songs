Raining in the water 
 Waiting in the water to run 
 Raining in the water 
 Gotta find a trouble to fall down 
 No justice, Zimmerman is a racist 
 A child killer, floor he tolerates it 
 He a wanna be copper I swear 
 He dialed 911 
 46 in the past 8 years 
 6 was last year to no affair 
 We'll never recall he complained about a black male 
 Treyvon was buying Ice Tea and some skittles 
 Zimmerman chased him to his death with a pistol 
 How can you scream self defense 
 When you had nothing to defend yourself against 
 Dispatcher told him not to follow, he pursued 
 With 9 mm and called him a fucking coon 
 A coon is short for raccoon 
 In the slavery days that's what they called black dudes 
 Whoever don't help is guilty (why?) 
 'Cause he cried for help, his last words was "help me"

 The Florida they got a low course stay on your ground 
 Which put a 17 years old young man in the ground 
 Heraldo don't said black kids shouldn't wear hoodies 
 Compare a hoodie to a killer, how could he 
 Sean Bell ain't wear a hoodie and they still shot him 
 Dialo didn't wear a hoodie and they still shot him 
 What's wrong with Heraldo's brain 
 The Ku Klux Klan wear hoods ain't nobody complains 
 Let them keep killing our kings we have no future 
 Vigilante shooters they say since it happen 
 Skittles made money in stock my applause 
 I hope they donate some of that money to the cause 
 Obama stepped up sold the al shapner 
 RIP Trayvon Martin 
 Police chief Bill Lee, justify the murder 
 Then he stepped down from his position no more further
