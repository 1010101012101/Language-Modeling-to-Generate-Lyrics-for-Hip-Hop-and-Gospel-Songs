Lames getting me vex 
 Bang off the reflex 
 Drown in the streets 
 I ain't see a good key yet 
 Holes in his white T shoot him in his V neck 
 Bring drama to your door step UPS 
 Bullets hit the chamber and the shells hit the seaman 
 Make a nigga do the harlem shake like G depp 
 'Cause we dress the impress yes, they know we fresh 
 Man they er'thing got no class went to recess 
 Bang bang, stand now how my actions never regret 
 My homeboy used to fish tell me in the GS 
 My man putting work can't believe he hesitated 
 Took the gun out of his hand 
 Told him ain't thug-educated 
 'Cause me, I would've aired that shit 
 Ask the boys in your hood how I clear that strip 
 To all the lames that be dissing 
 You pray to God that you don't see me 
 I'm a big ass on front street 
 In HD and 3d 
 Mac a zombie and benjamins 
 You get washingtons like DC 
 Can't saboutage my catalogue 
 So I laugh at y'all like he he 
 Lame you a reject, he gon' need 3 vests 
 Boy I run the city pop the clip when they eject 
 Blunt homies berreting crispy getting they crack in 
 Blow your money while you stack in 
 Now put the man in Manhattan 
 They say life is short but I bet you 
 You can play Russian roulette with my ratchet 
 'Cause it's smith the west and I hit perfections 
 And get this ratch in this rappers 
 I say dug up, you heard it that 
 After course we heard of that 
 Take one of the after go do the chucks 
 We're off your bush you murder back 
 1.5 I tuck that put it in a hole like fold rap 
 Throw for your man down he raining 
 He should've sworn back 
 I hooked on that nigga, may weather that lame 
 Getting money trigger happy papi 
 I stressed up I got know slake 
 That's because I do hoe, more shells then nuro 
 My move's pretty meditated I planned it 
 Pluto 
 You wanna talk, or you wanna play 
 I be laughing at these lames er'day 
 Boss on sale weed booyay 
 When you see 'em in the streets 
 They ain't moving what they say 
 Man these niggas is burns 
 Man these niggas is burns 
 Man these niggas is burns 
 Man these niggas is burns 
 They say they on fire walking on with wires 
 They ain't nothing but some liars 
 I'm a sayan man these niggas is burns
