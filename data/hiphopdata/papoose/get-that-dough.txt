I gotta get that dough 
 I gotta stack up on my chips 
 Put a shine up on my wrist 
 I'm a hustler babe 
 I gotta get that dough 
 You be calling me, calling me 
 I gotta get that dough 
 I gotta brush up on my pimp game 
 Stay up on my feet man 
 I gotta get that dough 
 You be calling me, calling me 
 My house lavish luxurious outlandish 
 Enough crack to make the east coast out vanish 
 Enough chronic to keep the west coast counting cabbage 
 Enough bread to make the whole dirty south a sandwich 
 Claiming you got money what's you account balance 
 Industry nigga, I get fly without the style 
 My doormat reads welcome to Papoose palace 
 Your text bracket is mad kelvish 
 You got a nice crib, but I laugh when I pass you 
 Cribs is for babies man, I live in a castle 
 My kingdom stand on my throne in a threesome 
 Me, myself and I enjoying my freedom 
 On fire from Head of New England 
 So when you pass me, you pass a fire like babies when they teeth in 
 The mafia kids, we push you off with the forearms 
 The only thing you can kiss is the ground that I root on 
 I gotta get that dough 
 I gotta stack up on my chips 
 Put a shine up on my wrist 
 I'm a hustler babe 
 I gotta get that dough 
 You be calling me, calling me 
 I gotta get that dough 
 I gotta brush up on my pimp game 
 Stay up on my feet man 
 I gotta get that dough 
 You be calling me, calling me 
 They mad at my money 'cause I don't wanna trick it 
 They say they gonna fix you be more specific 
 Why you gonna fix me, life's short live it 
 You know they say, if it ain't broke don't fix it 
 I'm so ahead of my time I eat lunch for breakfast 
 Put on my medallion before I put on my necklace 
 The game mean, I gain green like infections 
 I could teach you the Game Boy just like Tetris 
 I let your girl drive my car, shawty bog 
 She was DWI driving while we love 
 She say she wanted to go clubin roll a budge 
 Jacuzzi up in the telly we can rubber dub 
 She in love with my buzz 
 I told her the hotel was like a ace of spade 
 It's better than the club 
 What you mean you made me I helped you put weight on 
 The only thing you can make is the bed that I lay on 
 I gotta get that dough 
 I gotta stack up on my chips 
 Put a shine up on my wrist 
 I'm a hustler babe 
 I gotta get that dough 
 You be calling me, calling me 
 I gotta get that dough 
 I gotta brush up on my pimp game 
 Stay up on my feet man 
 I gotta get that dough 
 You be calling me, calling me 
 Money be calling me 
 Hello can I speak to Pap? 
 I'm on the other line with money I call you back 
 Dollar bills be saying, Yo Pap' get your chips up 
 Ball me up in the night, and spend me in the strip club 
 5 dollar bills be saying spend me on the tobe 
 Let 'em keep the change them punk cops broke 
 10 dollar bills saying stay on your grind 
 To get your hands on me you had to move dimes 
 20 dollar bills be saying dig gully 
 Dressed that ugly hoodies and ressin 
 50 dollar bills be saying display 
 So we can smoke for days 50 sacks of haze 
 100 dollar bills is ignorant 
 'Cause they was filling their selves 
 It's big may all about the benjamines 
 Plastic talk too, Pap watch out 
 Keep a safe Uncle Sam might freeze your account 
 I gotta get that dough 
 I gotta stack up on my chips 
 Put a shine up on my wrist 
 I'm a hustler babe 
 I gotta get that dough 
 You be calling me, calling me 
 I gotta get that dough 
 I gotta brush up on my pimp game 
 Stay up on my feet man 
 I gotta get that dough 
 You be calling me, calling me 
 I gotta get that dough 
 I gotta stack up on my chips 
 Put a shine up on my wrist 
 I'm a hustler babe
