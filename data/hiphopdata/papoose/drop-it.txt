(Feat. Busta Rhymes) 
 (Chorus - Papoose) 
 Gun to mind 
 Mind to gun 
 Define which one is the surviving one 
 You say to mind your means is surviving 
 Define it son 
 Rappers use their mind 
 Since the mind behind the gun 
 The mind refines the dumb 
 Guarding them for time to come 
 Drop it son 
 Gun to mind 
 Mind to gun 
 Define which one is the surviving one 
 You say guns is your means to surviving 
 Define it son 
 Where you get your power from when drama comes? 
 Behind the gun 
 Power is money 
 Money is power 
 Drop it son 
 (Verse 1 - Papoose) 
 Mind over matter 
 You need common sense 
 So you can analyze and study current events 
 Politics got me sick to my stomach 
 I'm feeling nausea 
 Can't go to Atlantic City to get my dollars up 
 The casino's shut down from the bottom up 
 Lost a lot of money out there 
 Feel like they robbing us 
 The governor he a billionaire 
 He got a lot of bucks 
 Guess all the money he made is just not enough 
 Suicidal bombers in and out of la gradia 
 Governor Cozine scared of the mafia 
 His way or the high way, no hesitation 
 It's about to be a political assassination 
 And they say the terrorists had plans to blow the Holland up 
 Push the water into the Manhattan to flood the island up 
 They say it can't happen 
 Man they always lie to us 
 The Hudson River got enough water to fucken swallow us 
 (Chorus - Papoose) 
 (Verse 2 - Busta Rhymes) 
 Pap, you so right when you say the mind refines the dumb 
 With the powerful jewel I drop they wonder where my knowledge from 
 So I tell them I possess the power of an army 
 Numb the oppression, all the aggression 
 Combine it as one with science that awakes them when they sleep and re-forces them to replay it 
 As it gets deeper they'll probably kill me when I try to say it 
 Because of the power I possess already 
 Shit is funny 
 The say I'm more potentially dangerous when I get money 
 Never hesitate to kill a devil or superstition 
 But the random orange alerts that scare you into submission 
 I give your proper understanding, just acknowledge the wisdom 
 There's still the fear of god and the fear of terrorism 
 But no matter the circumstances I'll be the one first to get the iron 
 Command my respect and survive me the worst shit 
 While I share another perspective; the truthers don't abuse it 
 As I have the ratchet I'm praying I do not have to use it 
 (Chorus - Papoose) 
 (Verse 3 - Papoose) 
 Power is money so in guns we trust 
 All we do is re-up, bag up, roll, and puff 
 They saying freeze, I've done froze enough 
 Rather close my eyes before I let these cops close my cuffs 
 Call me grimey I give niggas whose hold and stuck 
 Like these body bluffing ass niggas supposed to front 
 You can call me watch you wanna 
 I couldn't give a golden fuck 
 I take the pennies out your loafers punk 
 See you got your man posted up 
 Don't tell him to hold you down 
 You going to need someone to hold you up 
 When I put it to his chest and unload the pump 
 I'm going to hit him until his mutherfuckin' shoulders touch 
 I think with my gun 
 Keep the 'fo in my nuts 
 Roll up on you while you rolling a blunt 
 They say keep your enemy close 
 Keep my enemy close - for what? 
 I catch my enemy close, I'm a roast his guts 
 (Chorus - Papoose)
