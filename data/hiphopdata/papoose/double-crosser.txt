It's a lot of double crossers out here 
 I rely on talent though 
 One gun up 
 I represent the epitome of lyricism 
 Double crossers die slow 
 Sample: 
 Sometiiimes, I think about it 
 And my poor heart wants to die about it (Woo!) 
 About the sweet sweet love lost 
 And the way I got double crossed 
 By a guy who was my friend 
 I see him now and then 
 My enterprise is ya demise coming into ya defeat 
 I write with a fire in pen and signature the beat 
 In and out of the system, snitches get released 
 They eat breakfast in jail and dinner on the streets 
 Niggaz get caught slippin' wit slippers on they feet 
 Get cut from ear to ear, blood drippin' from his cheek 
 I carry the broke gun, was missin' off a piece 
 The clip all bent up, but gripped it when it's beef 
 The clip don't wanna go in, I force it in the heat 
 I force it (faucet) like the water with the dishes in the sink 
 Went on a robbin' spree, been stickin' up for weeks 
 Don't communicate with the Jake or listen when they speak 
 "Come out wit ya hands up, this is the police!" 
 I tell 'em "Hell no, no surrender no retreat" 
 They wasn't built like me, these niggaz don't compete 
 Ya gimmick is unfinished, my image is complete 
 You say you underground but the wisdom that I speak 
 Walks upon the ground you livin' underneath 
 Mainstream dream I was lifted from beneath 
 Anybody deeper me's the deceased 
 But yo, you ever stared at a man with the vision of a beast? 
 Make 'em look just like food, just lift 'em up and eat 
 You wanna be a thug, I must say 
 It ain't a two way street, it's a one-way 
 The more money then the more gunplay 
 But everybody gotta go one day 
 I'm prepared to ride, won't hesitate to put a man in the sky 
 So when you talking to me you should stare in my eyes 
 Lookin' for me, I'm right here in the 'Stuy 
 Brooklyn niggaz ain't scared to die 
 Before I had an interview, a photo shoot and a show 
 All I had was a jukes, I laid niggaz on the floor 
 When I run in the spot, I know when its time to go 
 Get the drugs, get the jewels, the money and hit the door 
 Niggaz do what you tell 'em when you holdin' that 4-4 
 Pull a gun on a "Yes" man and make 'em say "No!" 
 How long you been beatin' ya girl?, you straight wilin' 
 Now you in and out of the can, domestic violence 
 It's kinda childish, man I wouldn't wanna be you 
 The judge gon' either 2 to 6 you or 1 to 3 you 
 On the visitin' floor, with the girl who ID'ed you 
 Dem broads'll get you locked up, then come see you 
 I be in ya hood, I got a chick on ya block, 
 I be spendin' the night, she got a nice lil' spot 
 You say ya hood tough and whatnot 
 But all the times I been in ya hood, I never heard one shot 
 Hop in the caddy truck and swerve up the block 
 The nerve that I got it 
 Niggaz be actin' like they harder than me 
 But tell me, How hard can they be? 
 Startin' wit me, then wanna squash shit wit me 
 Mayne you far from a G 
 All those fagets gonna either have to Automatic, or Revolve' it wit me 
 I was mindin' my own, why they botherin' me? 
 I bring death upon enemies 
 If my daddy was a real nigga-what they thought I was gon' be? 
 The apple don't fall too far from the tree 
 You wanna be a thug, I must say 
 It ain't a two way street, it's a one-way 
 The more money then the more gunplay 
 But everybody gotta go one day 
 I'm prepared to ride, won't hesitate to put a man in the sky 
 So when you talking to me you should stare in my eyes 
 Lookin' for me, I'm right here in the 'Stuy 
 Brooklyn niggaz ain't scared to die
