 When I kick it, I kick it ass as to beat with my enemy 
 You have thought it was 10 to me on point like a widow peak 
 Got that liberally give them dearies that do what it do, 
 Payin' a picture like doodling, you ain't shit but do do, 
 In the city where see me get pointed that damn it you 
 You can hide, you get it if you want to, I do karate moves 
 But the crush and tigers just might get broken down by a writer, 
 Yeah the passenger hopped out, but you got shot by the driver 
 There's a killer like everywhere, so why would you take it there, 
 Neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared 
 That's why my intelligence tell me to keep a band aid 
 Tell 'em fuck you I'll tell you fuck you back with my index finger 
 I can flip on some killershit but I'd rather keep cool 
 Keep it so remind it try not to be a pussy like you 
 Nigga that cali cold attack, cali on my back to my toy so break nigga 
 This is where set does game.

 I talk a smitten I'm so religious I blow your wicked, 
 Make 'em close the stiches, hells kitchen I'm throwing dishes 
 This is spoken wisdom as I journey a poet's mission 
 I'm a lift it, my flow is gift it 
 She cold with a bow and ribbon the role of riches, 
 Low the bisquits let's go to distance 
 I'm blow and listen my car how why you with a broke ignition 
 They so suspicious, low and vicious with no convictions 
 Juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison 
 Cold adrenaline I got this soul like a poet's living 
 So is spitting it's like I'm co-existent to prohibition 
 I'm a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it 
 Disrespect the spirit, or the artist who rap with lyrics 
 Mother of statistics they rap with metaphysics 
 And they yeah simplistic, they stay out as repetition 
 Show some recognition 
 Heard your album my best of missed it 
 Best that ever did it, 
 Papoose is the definition.
