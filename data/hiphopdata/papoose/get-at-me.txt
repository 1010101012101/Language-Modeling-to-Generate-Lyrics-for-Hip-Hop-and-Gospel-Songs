 You give 42 stacks, you can have that

 I'm ridin' with thugger in that new whip 
 We see our enemies then we stop in traffic 
 Bitch nigga get at me! 
 Mama ain't raised no savage 
 But if you owe me you better pay yo balance 
 The Brooklyn niggas, they so valid 
 You a deadbeat shooter, ain't man enough to raise yo ratchet 
 Screamin you the best but you ain't no Khaled 
 I got a bird in my paw and it ain't no parrot 
 Big homie, that ain't yo status

 We getting money, I be where them stacks be 
 Bitch boy say they wanna do something 
 But they never ever get at me 
 If I ain't the heads up I'm on Lafayette 
 It ain't hard to find Mr. Maggy 
 Bitch boy say they wanna do something 
 But they never ever get at me 
 Bitch nigga get at me! 
 Pop hammers, fly clothes watch wearer 
 IPhone 5 cameras, my flows got clearer 
 Grind hella, dime scrambler, I am a wise planner 
 None of y'all drop grammar like the men in my mirror 
 Yacht seller, shop blamer, cop scarer 
 Turn this track to a deadbeat like a man who can't buy Pampers 
 Cursed like a song bitch, motherfucker goddamner 
 Man I run this shit, like my plans, so tell 'em get at me 
 Bitch nigga get at me, yeah
