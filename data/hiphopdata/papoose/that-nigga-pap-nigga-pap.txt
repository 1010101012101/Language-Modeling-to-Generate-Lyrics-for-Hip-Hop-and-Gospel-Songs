That nigga pap, nigga pap, nigga pap, nigga pap 
 That nigga pap, nigga pap, papoose 
 Niggaz know me 
 Hottest nigga on the streets hommie, p-a-p 
 The bootleggers tell me, ain't seen a nigga this hott since 50 
 When these labels sign me ima lock the game up, me and kay sleezy 
 I'm a straight g, on some b-k shit, p-a-p 
 I keep my hammer tucked 
 Picture me scared of what? 
 A skinny nigga, so I alwayz pull my pants up 
 (Them niggaz tear shit up) who me I damn jump 
 Them niggaz tear shit up, hold up let me stand up 
 Why you [?] 
 You a scared fuck 
 They hit cha man up, then you better man up 
 You ain't got no damn guts, you god damn punk 
 Stop eight ball shaving, getcha grams up 
 Did a sweep on the block, when they ran up 
 You ain't even give us no warning, you got us jammed up 
 Seen 'em pull their vans up, you such a damn chump 
 Instead of say ya man down, let 'em lock ya man's up 
 Better hand cuff me to myself, I don't share cuffs 
 If they handcuff me to him, ima tear him up 
 See I came from the bottom, but I clammed up 
 So all my gangstas throw ya fucking hands up 
 I respect the dirty south, yeah they get it crunk 
 But there something I don't understand (what) 
 Why would I let a man jump, and pop his damn trunk 
 When I can tear him up, before he even stand up 
 See you scared to take a risk, but you ain't tuff 
 Papoose take more risk than handcuffs 
 Niggaz say they looking for me 
 They wanna blare me up 
 Looking where, I'm over here like dandruff 
 See see them niggaz chased you down 
 Said you was running to get your rachet 
 You never came back, you ran cause you a faggot 
 U like to send them wolves at niggas, you give 'em rachets 
 U might even cock the gun, but you never clap it 
 Go ahed send them wolves at me, send them bastards 
 I bet you I'll smoke everyone of them little bastards 
 Wolves move around in packs, I know their tactics 
 Hommie I smoke a pack a day, I gotta have it 
 I never shoot with my bad hand, I gotta clap with the hand 
 I bag crack with 
 When I re-up, I keep a drug attic with me, I open the plastic 
 Let them test it on the spot, I don't fuck with no cabbage 
 I can't stand middle men, the fuck up your cabbage 
 He tried to get his pc, so he wants you to have it 
 When I go to cop grams, I don't come with those faggots 
 I'm like a brand new house, I come with a attic 
 You know that nigga at the dice game holding a bank 
 Got everybody under pressure 'cause he roll with a eight 
 They be scared to beat his point and it shows in his face 
 Even when he throw a duece, they be hoping they ace 
 But while you raising your voice, hommie lower your base 
 Your body bluffin' is a total discrace 
 Deep down inside you don't want no parts of me 
 You ain't got no heart, if you ain't talking about no money, what cha tongue gon' talk 
 When I run up on you, that gun gon' spark 
 You like a nigga who getting a shape up, you don't want no parts 
 I just dip from the narks, 'cause I'm on the grind 
 I sent my dimes ten dollars, don't bring me mine 
 I ain't taking no shorts when it come to mine 
 While all ya niggas take more shorts than boosters in the summer time 
 Niggaz know me 
 Hottest nigga on the streets hommie, p-a-p 
 The bootleggers tell me, ain't seen a nigga this hott since 50 
 When these labels sign me ima lock the game up, me and kay sleezy 
 I'm a straight g, on some b-k shit, p-a-p
