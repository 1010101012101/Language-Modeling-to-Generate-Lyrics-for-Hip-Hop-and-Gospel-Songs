I'm so so serious 
 (Serious mannn) 
 (Oh, so serious) 
 I-I got it 
 I-I get it 
 Now I lay 
 Thee down to sleep 
 I pray my Lord 
 My soul to keep 
 If I should die 
 Though before I wake 
 Let my niggas celebrate 
 And split my cake 
 It's 50 
 I'm so real 
 You ain't seen 
 Nothin' realer 
 Ice crack dealer 
 I click clack 
 For the scrilla 
 I'm heartless 
 Ssomething like 
 A cold blooded killer 
 I'm filthy, dirty 
 With the money my nigga 
 I done ran 
 Through more cars 
 Then your 
 Rolls Rroyce dealer 
 I put that 
 On my god-daughter 
 I love you Jarmilla 
 New Bentley or not 
 Match the chincilla 
 Sean don spiller 
 Matching 4-wheeler 
 I'm big in New York 
 I move like godzilla 
 Go-rilla 
 You are not deep nigga 
 Grave-digger 
 Ask Puffy and Jigga 
 Made nigga 
 My pockets 
 Get bigger and bigger 
 You got no choice 
 But to feel a nigga 
 When I spit that shit 
 I figure 
 It will only 
 Bring mo' bread 
 You fuck around 
 I get down 
 And go upside yo' head 
 Now I lay thee 
 Down to sleep 
 I pray my Lord 
 My soul to keep 
 If I should die 
 Though before I wake 
 Let my niggas celebrate 
 And split my cake 
 Now I lay 
 Thee down to sleep 
 I pray the Lord 
 Fforgive me 
 For holding heat 
 If I should die 
 Though before I wake 
 Let my niggas celebrate 
 And split my cake 
 50 Speaking 
 I just got back 
 From the UK 
 A little jet-lagged 
 Ffrom the flight 
 But when 
 I'm out there 
 They say 
 50, 50 
 You're my favourite 
 We love you 50 
 Your massive 
 Mash it tup 
 There is not 
 Competetion 
 No, no 
 There's no 
 Competetion 
 You have 
 To be kidding 
 I'm can't 
 Believe it I'm? 
 It's 50, yeah
