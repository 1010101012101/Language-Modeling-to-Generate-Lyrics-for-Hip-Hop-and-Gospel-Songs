Adamz song (remix) 
 Hey adam (echo) Fuck U 
 (RAPPIN') Met a kid named adam-fuckin' ugly, 
 Tried my dawg and bumped me 
 Gonna end up with a black eye-"You finin fight boy," 
 Told yo ass not to mess with a crazy white boy 
 Don't understand why Tiffany loves 'em, 
 Don't understabd why Tiffany hugs 'em 
 Messin their relationship, 
 Kick his ass all the way to space and shit 
 Tryin' me and Rich, 
 Bitch 
 Go ahead jump shoelace, 
 Imma give you a free hit-then we'll bust your face! 
 That's it so fuck it, 
 Dirty does it
