 If I was your best friend, I want you round all the time (I want you round me all the time) 
 Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)

 First we get to talkin', then we get to touchin' 
 If we could pass the phone games, we'll be fuckin' 
 I'll kiss you like the French before my tongue in your ear 
 Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair 
 Me in different scenery just means a different position 
 In a tub or in the sink I improvise now listen 
 In the chopper or in the jet you mile high club 
 I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love 
 But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know 
 Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozens of those 
 See I see something special when I look in your eyes 
 With your legs way back I say this pussy is mines 
 If you ain't sure when I'm talkin' I don't tell you no lies 
 But there's things that you say that have me wanderin' why 
 When I don't say what I'm thinkin' it don't mean that I'm shy 
 Got on that shit that you picked for me that's why I'm so fly 
 If I was your best friend, I want you round all the time (I want you round me all the time)

 While you in your bubble bath I can wash on your back 
 When you puttin' on your lotion I can help you wid that 
 I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile 
 Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style 
 The slang I use when we bill may change how you talk 
 And if I'm focused when I'm strokin' I can change how you walk 
 It's the swagger that you come for but when you come from New York 
 I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought 
 Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best 
 If there's a price to pay for feelin' you, I pay that twice 
 I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right 
 I ain't got nutin' to hide baby I tell you my secrets 
 'For you end up bein' around long enough to peep shit 
 I get closer to you, I mean closer than close 
 I get into you, after I take off my clothes 
 Girl I been into you, mentally long before... 
 If I was your best friend, I want you round all the time (I want you round me all the time) 
 Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine) 
 Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh)
