(50 Cent) 
 Money make a pimp, pimp hoes, hustlas sell dope, thugs gun smoke 
 What (echo) 
 Money make the world go round, as the world turns 
 Money make the world go round, as the world turns 
 Nigga I need money to main-tainn 
 Hustalin ain't a gamee 
 Nigga go and gets the grainn 
 Gon' get tore out the framee 
 T.Vs in the Rangee 
 I'm in ta nice thanggs I slang weed (snort) 
 Coc-ainee and Herio-anee 
 50 Cent 
 That's my namee 
 Nigga I bring the painn 
 You thought shit stay the samee 
 Nigga shit gon' change 
 Put a bullet in your brainn 
 Nigga at close range 
 Run away wit ya rollie, your rings, and your motherfuckin chainn 
 Ain't nuittin funny mangg 
 I'm about my money mangg 
 Bitch get down on that track and get my money, I ain't playinn 
 Better understan what I'm sayin', 
 What I'm sayin', I ain't playin' 
 I'll be, In front of your crib, layin, wit the mack ta start sprayinn 
 Any nigga that's in the game, for the fame, gotta be a lamee 
 Crackers'll put ya in chains 
 Box'll drive you insane 
 Sun can't shine all the time, man its gotta rain 
 That whole loose? is ill 
 You better crack the whip mang 
 (Chorus - 50 Cent) 
 A pimp ain't a pimp with no hoes (hoes) 
 A hustla ain't a hustla with no motherfuckin dough (dough) 
 A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke (smoke) 
 A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke (broke) 
 A pimp ain't a pimp with no motherfuckin hoes (hoes) 
 A hustla ain't a hustla with no motherfuckin dough (dough) 
 A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke (smoke) 
 A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke (broke) 
 (50 Cent)

 Life in the fast lane 
 Man I ain't got nuttin ta lose 
 Everythin' a game 
 Either you wit me or against me man ain't nuttin changee 
 Nigga, you 
 Go against the grain 
 I'll make you 
 Walk wit a cane now nigga now 
 Who you gon' blamee 
 When shit ain't the same 
 Nigga nobody hears your namee 
 You got down wit a gangg 
 O thirty-one blood 
 Y'all niggas do your thang 
 You got 2 felonies 
 Fuck it, go out wit a bangg 
 Y'all niggas wanna hangg 
 Wit niggas that fitlthy rich 
 They ain't even got ta talk 
 To take your bitch 
 One look was all it took 
 She seen the benz-o 
 She seen them T.Vs 
 And them big ol' chriz-omes 
 A-yo the bitch useta bring you dough 
 Useta be your bottom hoe 
 Now your paper comin' slow 
 She feel like she had ta go 
 Roll wit them rich niggas and ball with them ball-az 
 Politic wit the willies the real shot call-az 
 (Bun B) 
 I got one life to live 
 Follow that light that keeps on guidin me 
 Hate-az tryin' me 
 Hoes is a-bidein me 
 Media ride me 
 King a the underground 
 So the streets is steady hide-in me 
 Representin sure taste-az 
 The yay keep takin' pride in me 
 Streets 
 Deciple slide-in me 
 Status reports the badest you caught 
 Walk in the black top wit fat rocks and had his newport 
 I can't stay away like Too $hort 
 I gots ta break a bastards back 
 Tore 'em up, get 'em ready ta port 
 Put 'em on the master track 
 I blast the facts the life in the grill 
 Gorilla pimpin' 
 If I have ta mack ya wife then I will 
 It's me and 50 Cent my nigga 
 Live in trife, and that's real 
 Talkin' shit on us, that's like pullin out a knife and don't kill 
 That's on for treal (?) 
 I'm on for million wit your pit, in the clit that shit true 
 I split through, your defences, so relentless, get you, without you even 
 Knoin 
 Got you strippin and even hoe-in 
 You don't wanna let the pro in the door 
 This what we showin 
 A pimp ain't a pimp with no motherfuckin hoes (hoes) 
 A hustla ain't a hustla with no motherfuckin dough (dough) 
 A thug ain't a thug if his gun don't smoke (smoke) 
 A playa ain't a playa if his ass dead broke (broke) 
 (50 Cent) 
 Is your bitch your bitch or is your bitch mines? 
 Is your bitch your bitch all the time? 
 You done got your paper, now its time I get mines 
 Except the serve and everything'll be fine 
 Bitch! 
 (50 Cent talking over beat) 
 Runnin' from pimpin'... bitch you need to run TO some pimpin' 
 Wit them cheap ass payless shoes you got on hoe 
 You still ain't figured out what a hoe supposed to look like 
 Look at you motherfucka here 
 Huh bitch? 
 How you gunna catch some dates lookin' like that hoe? 
 Bitch get off the sidewalk and into the street 
 Bitch the sidewalk is for pimpin' bitch!
