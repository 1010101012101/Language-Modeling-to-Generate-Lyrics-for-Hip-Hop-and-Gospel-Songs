(Gun Shots) 
 (Chorus Akon) 
 Ooh don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood 
 Ain't nothing changed still holla at my homies 
 Ooh and when I hit the block I still will kill 
 And I don't want to, nigga but I will if I got to kill 
 If niggas get the fuckin' around 
 If niggas get the fuckin' around 
 (End Chorus) 
 Respect come from admiration and fear 
 You can admire or me or you can catch one in your wig 
 See the testorossa the toasta is right on my lap 
 So if a nigga get outta line a nigga get clapped 
 I got a arseanal an infatry I'm built for this mentally 
 That's why I'm the general I do what they pretend to do 
 Front on me now nigga I'll be the end of you 
 Forget your enemies and think of what your frieds'll do 
 I drop a bag off, they let a mag off 
 That ---- glock will tear half your ass off 
 I'm not for the games I'm not for all the playin' 
 The hollow tips rain, when I unleash the pain 
 Get the message from the lines or get the message from the nine 
 Paint a picture with words you can see me when I shine 
 Put my back on the wall nigga watch me go for mine 
 I let 21 shots off all at the same time (yeah) 
 (Chorus Akon) 
 Ooh don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood 
 Ain't nothing changed still holla at my homies 
 Ooh and when I hit the block I still will kill 
 And I don't want to, nigga but I will if I got to kill 
 If niggas get the fuckin' around 
 If niggas get the fuckin' around 
 (End Chorus) 
 Where I'm from death is already in the air homie 
 Nana love me so you know she say my prayers for me 
 I come creeping through the hood wearin teflon 
 Hit the corners Muthafuckers get left on 
 Niggas know if not they better check my background 
 Tryna stick me I'll fill your back with mack rounds 
 Ask pretty nigga 50 don't back down 
 I keep it funky like fiends in the crack house 
 Cross the line boy imma air ya ass out 
 Screw your face at me I wanna know what thas bout 
 Nigga I know you ain't mad I done came up 
 And if you are fuck you 'cause I ain't change up 
 The OG's wanna talk but I don't know these niggas 
 And I ain't did no business with 'em I don't owe these niggas 
 A minute of my time I did it 'cause I grind 
 All across the globe like the worlds mine (yeah!) 
 (Chorus Akon) 
 Ooh don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood 
 Ain't nothing changed still holla at my homies 
 Ooh and when I hit the block I still will kill 
 And I don't want to, nigga but I will if I got to kill 
 If niggas get the fuckin' around 
 If niggas get the fuckin' around 
 (End Chorus) 
 (Convict) 
 (Akon Verse) 
 Now tell me have you eva looked up in an instance 
 And seen a mack aimin at your head mayne (head mayne) 
 Before you know it life is flashin ----- 
 And your body is drippin and full of lead mayne (lead mayne) 
 I done been there (uh-huh) I done copped that (uh-huh) 
 But it ain't neva been a question about that (uh) 
 Don't go there (uh) You'll get --- (uh-huh) 
 And if ya ---- fuckaround and re-route that (uh-huh) 
 You'll neva catch me ridin' around in these streets 
 Without a couple metal pieces under my feet 
 Fully automatic whippers in the --- with --- 
 Stash under the carpet like a can of seaweed 
 Fifty don't make me ride on these niggas (ay) 
 'Cause I will kill dip and hide on these niggas (ooh) 
 Fifty don't make me ride on these niggas (ay) 
 'Cause I'll be long gone like the rippa (so) 
 (Chorus Akon) 
 Don't even look at me wrong when I come through the hood 
 Ain't nothing changed still holla at my homies 
 Ooh and when I hit the block I still will kill 
 And I don't want to, nigga but I will if I got to kill 
 If niggas get the fuckin' around 
 If niggas get the fuckin' around 
 (End Chorus)
