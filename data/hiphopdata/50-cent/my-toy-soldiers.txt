You Ready? Ok let me wind you up 
 Do it exactly the way I said do it man 
 These Niggas is pussy you heard me? 
 Get up nice and close 
 Ya! 
 I put that battery in his back 
 I'm the reason why he moves like that 
 That's my muthafucking toy soldier 
 I tell him pop that gat 
 He gonna pop that gat 
 You don't want to play with my toy soldier 
 I say its on then its on until your life is over 
 Fucking with my toy soldier 
 If hes a casualty of war 
 Trust me I got more 
 You don't want it with my Toy Soldier 
 (Verse1 - 50 Cent) 
 Now listen up close and follow instructions 
 Catch a nigga slippin run up on them buck 'em 
 I ain't got no conscience, no morals or nothing 
 They ain't with us they against us we suppost to touch them 
 Heres what to do if you see them approach me 
 Pop that nigga I don't care if he know me 
 Half the niggas hating on me use to be homies 
 I don't trust them when they smile or playing 'cause they phoney 
 Everytime I come around they call the police on me 
 That's why the d's and the prisents know me 
 They know about my rap shit, they know how I'll clap you 
 Run like I'm in a track meet, swift with the mac B 
 Can see the envy in there eyes for sure man (mann) 
 Mad as a muthafucka that I'm holdin' (holdinnn) 
 See me in the back of the phantom (rollinnn) 
 Quick to make examples out of niggas for sure man (mann) 
 Hold me down... 
 I put that battery in his back 
 I'm the reason why he moves like that 
 That's my muthafucking toy soldier 
 I tell him pop that gat 
 He gonna pop that gat 
 You don't want to play with my toy soldier 
 I say its on then its on until your life is over 
 Fucking with my toy soldier 
 If hes a casualty of war 
 Trust me I got more 
 You don't want it with my Toy Soldier 
 (Verse2 - 50 Cent) 
 Shoot, stab, kill muthafucka 
 You ain't 'bout it, I don't want you around cocksucka 
 Every word out my mouth is felt 
 That Uz I pop, dem hollows so hot your ass will melt 
 Barber razor in the club, stunt, ill give ya a shape up 
 Have your ass stitch, gauged, your head all taped up 
 Niggas know how I get down 
 See they know when I'm around (ha ha) 
 My soldiers around 
 And if some shit goes down 
 And a nigga get laid down 
 Its no surprise cause niggas know how we get down 
 Black tints on the tested Rosta 
 Hammer out the hosta 
 Gat in my lap incase you gotta get clapped 
 You monkey niggas went to my hood 
 We on that guerilla shit 
 You clap off and miss 
 We come back and start killing shit 
 Catch us on the corner wearing black chinchilla shit 
 We organized, disciplined plus we militant 
 I put that battery in his back 
 I'm the reason why he moves like that 
 That's my muthafucking toy soldier 
 I tell him pop that gat 
 He gonna pop that gat 
 You don't want to play with my toy soldier 
 I say its on then its on until your life is over 
 Fucking with my toy soldier 
 If hes a casualty of war 
 Trust me I got more 
 You don't want it with my Toy Soldier 
 (Bridge - Yayo Screwed and Chopped) 
 Through the window 
 Into a man's soul 
 ... 
 Fill you with holes 
 Listen homes... I'm the man for the job 
 ...We ain't playing 
 (50 Cent) : Yayo! 
 (Tony Yayo) - Come on! 
 (Verse3 - Tony Yayo) 
 I'm in the coupe or phantom and the body kitted 
 Waves in my hair looking like Tsunami hit it 
 Niggas scheme... the infared beam on the mac 
 I put green on your head like a Oakland A's Hat 
 My boy was a douljah, now hes a soldier 
 My little son Dula, Lettin off the Ruger 
 In the whip mashed up looking for his enemies 
 Riding and gased up off double d batteries 
 Tonight's casualties is hooked to them Iv's 
 (50 Give me the word) 
 That's when I Squeeze (Ya!) 
 Clik Clack take that 
 Fall Back 
 It's a contract 50 grand 
 I'm 50's Man 
 I put that battery in his back 
 I'm the reason he moves like that 
 That's my muthafucking toy soldier 
 I tell him pop that gat 
 He gonna pop that gat 
 You don't want to play with my toy soldier 
 I say its on then its on until your life is over 
 Fucking with my toy soldier 
 If hes a casualty of war 
 Trust me I got more 
 You don't want it with my Toy Soldier

 This is the general speaking (yaaa..) 
 When I say move (ha.ha.hahahaa) 
 Nigga you better move (wooooh!)

 I don't want nobody talking to none of my niggas 
 Come around with here with that bullshit 
 Trying to feed niggas bad information and shit... 
 That's how my toys malfunction
