 In the snow after the shots in December

 Game: 
 I'm in that 6, 7 glass house 
 In and out of lanes 
 Murder on my mind 
 Old English runnin' through my veins 
 I think about easy and it eases my pain 
 I drink a 40 ounce g unit soakin in the game 
 I came into this world both feet in the dirt 
 No purple label no button down shirt 
 No harm intended to subliminal disses 
 But hardcore separate the men from the bitches 
 I would popped your ass if I thought you was worthy 
 Lookin' like boy george in that larry bird jersey 
 Buck pass the dutch I'm blowin' that bob marley 
 Hop off the G-4 lets have a boston tech party G-UNIT

 I'm so Sorry 
 Lloyd Banks: Yeah 
 A snap of a finger will make you guys cripple 
 I came up with shitta, nigga 
 I handle bars like a bicycle 
 Stars make your eyes trickle 
 As stiff as an icecycle 
 The muffalas the sounds of land that's why I whistle 
 File your status you know that's wrong 
 Before you go and put that foot locker noback on 
 Around here niggas get shot for performin that song 
 And hoes cut they eyebrows off and draw them back on 
 They try to merk me yo 
 That's why 50 bought me a trey pound with a nose longer then pinnchio 
 Pop shit I stroke your slut 
 And soon as her mouth open up what? 
 Same color as coconut

 Nobody gonna miss you when the dessert eagle hits you 
 Just do like pac said pour out a little liquor 
 Picture gettin' your chest blown open and no one there to save ya 
 You momma gotta wake up makin' funeral arrangements 
 You know who to play with and we ain't the ones 
 Thins G-unit shit is deeper than a prick in your thumb motha fuckas
