Ok letz start from the little person from the book 
 You might say he is a crook 
 His name is lil tima 
 We chill wit him 'cause he a good rhyma 
 Next we got weedy 
 He ain't greedy 
 He'll kick ur ass fast 
 And you won't be the last 
 The next person we got is blackice 
 He good but he ain't no obie trice 
 He mad kool 
 For sure he ain't no fool 
 The last person we got is biggie dix 
 He'll kill you wit just a pair of stix 
 He plays fare 
 Jus don't look and stare 
 Now we jus named the Deadly Devilz 
 This ain't no game 
 So there ain't no levelz. 
 Together were the best team 
 Piss us off and we'll let out steem!
