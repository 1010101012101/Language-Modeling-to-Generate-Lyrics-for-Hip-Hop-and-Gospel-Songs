(Nas) 
 Had talked to the rich ones who flash and floss 
 Pour some liquors out to my dogs trapped up north 
 Reminisce on the deceased who no longer exsist 
 Only wishin we could bring 'em back with songls like this 
 Old flicks of us chillin' with the old time cliques 
 Hold the nine start some death not our lives we risk 
 How it used to be, early morn pumpin in shifts 
 Jakes with pale faces and the night is the scariest 
 They handcuffed me, they knew my government and alias 
 Various calls were made up for awarin us 
 The deeds in the marked vans and cabs in our land 
 Hood rats get stabbed by niggas who forty 
 Turnin' out young ladies and makin' athourity (?) 
 Got 'em coked out 
 The hood is bugged out thug babies 
 Famous in they strollers 
 Before they walked they knew the hood talk 
 Its in the air of New York 
 So everybody would pick 'em up, kissin' 'em up 
 Treatin 'em like they own, in this hood we call home 
 Fist fight till we grown, then these guns come out 
 Cirlce of life, its kinda deep how we turn out 
 (50 Cent) 
 Ay yo them niggas that wanted beef before don't want no beef no more 
 Now that they know who I rep with (QB nigga) 
 Who I rep with (QB nigga) 
 Yo them niggas that wanted beef before don't want no beef no more 
 Now that they know who I rep with (QB nigga) 
 Who I rep with (QB nigga) 
 (50 Cent) 
 Y'all niggas better sober up before you speek to me don't come at me high 
 Last rapper that raised his voice at me got jacked in the eye 
 Now if I say I'm gonna get ya I'ma get ya on the strip in the infinite 
 At long range I can hit ya 
 You find out them niggas that witchya ain't even witchya 
 After the gem start splittin you need an md to stitch ya 
 Peep how I use words to paint pictures 
 Peep how I got niggas with bodies askin me for 10 cent to go hit ya 
 Look my name up in the law book: Curtis Jackson 
 Known for creatin' action, by rapidly clappin 
 Nigga I stay strapped, so much I nick-name gats 
 Got a the I call Tina 
 A nine I name Nina 
 Two niggas went to see a loft an they seen her 
 This QB shit bout to take me to the next level 
 Next crib, next benz, next bitch, next bezzle 
 It's that real 
 (Bravehearts) 
 Ay yo who the fuck wanna war? 
 I gotta four-four penetrate y'all niggas jaw 
 You see me thugged out, iced out, gettin' style 
 Hopin out the range with the gun out 
 Smack your man down you ran off 
 I was gonna hit 'em with two, left some for you 
 I put four, QB rugged and raw 
 I got sumthin for the rap cats 
 Fish tailed back gats 
 Scope with a beam on it 
 Loaded put your cream on it 
 Shine on scheme on it 
 I make 'em dream about it for ever 
 Whatever whatever 
 Get gullied, shots through your leather and cloth 
 When you scurry off, wake y'all clowns up 
 Yo hollow tips will fight yo jacket 
 I don't give a fuck who you be 
 Millennium thug, now who the fuck wanted beef? 
 I master the art 
 Of slap boxin niggas in the dark 
 QB's big man horse of the braveheart 
 I'm the sasquatch of rap 
 Collector of gats 
 Test the macs on your bullet proof vests and hats 
 How bout that 
 Guns bust off I bust back 
 When trucks backfire I bust back 
 How bout that? 
 Stomp a mutha fuckin' rib out your back 
 Y'all niggas ain't gansta rap 
 Your clique like josie and the pussy cats 
 When we come around the front stop 
 Y'all can't fuck around you'll get dropped 
 When guns pop, whos tellin'? 
 Twin barrel nines wavin and yellin' 
 QB nigga what? 
 Two time fellon 
 Straight for the mellon, straight for the dome 
 Send a nigga back, get the shells, go straight home 
 Never slip, my ill will to survive is so deep 
 Can't sleep cause of the death, makes me week 
 Pullin triggers at my shadows 
 Bravehearts pop up 
 Where's Jungle and Horse shot yo block up
