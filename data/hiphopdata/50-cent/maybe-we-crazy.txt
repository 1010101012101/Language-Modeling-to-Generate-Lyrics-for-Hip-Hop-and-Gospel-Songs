(Intro: 50 cent) 
 Yeah, uhuh, lets take 'em dre, yeah 
 (Verse 1: 50 cent) 
 Tony did ten years in the fed joint, he half way out 
 He ain't home, his ass in a halfway house 
 Correctional facilities don't correct shi* 
 Cause the first thing he asked is who gotta get hit 
 A shoot out in 89' fu**** up how he walk 
 He a grimey ass ni**a, you see how he talk 
 Should shoot the shepard in the head and da sheep gonna scatter, 
 Let ni**as talk cause action is all that matters, 
 I asked about bones self-esteem, he said he was soft, 
 Said the boys up in oldsville was breakin him off 
 Can you picture him in a jar, ni**as jokin him up, 
 Treatin him like a pin cushion, pokin him up 
 He came home actin' like he hard as fu** 
 Must want a first class ni**a to see god uhuh 
 Stuck his chest out tell a ni**a we don't back down 
 But wait until we find out tonys background 
 (Chorus x2: 50 cent) 
 Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up, 
 Ni**a front, then somethin' gon go down, 
 Ni**a stunt, cruise to this bitch if you want, 
 Widout a strap, and you gon getcha ass laid down 
 (Verse 2: 50 cent) 
 That ni**a joe comin' home soon he up there in four people, 
 Its on when he touch that 'cause he can get enough bricks, 
 When I was young he told me not to run, I pop my gun pa, 
 You can ask gun or la la love then aim hard, 
 I'm interested to hear back in the days, 
 They ain't better than my brain, young crime is pay, 
 New cadillacs and bonnevilles the very next day, 
 I just hope he learn, I ain't have much to say, 
 Lead jus squeeze the life out you like a boa constrictor, 
 F*** a headlock, I'm talking bout extortion ni**a, 
 Apply pressure, its hot get the f*** out the kitchen, 
 When ni**as pay ya every Friday you ain't got to stick em, 
 At the dice game if ace roll a six its no problem, 
 But if you roll a ace he gon pull out a robin, 
 Losin a little or lose lot, when ni**as is starving, 
 Man the drama in my hoods goin' down regardless 
 (Chorus x2: 50 cent) 
 Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up, 
 Ni**a front, then somethin' gon go down, 
 Ni**a stunt, cruise to this bit** if you want, 
 Widout a strap, and you gon getcha ass laid down 
 (Verse 3: 50 cent) 
 Everbody know education shots is all over short paper, 
 You on the run you want a ni**a hit son hit take it here, 
 Rise got shot up over some punk sh**, 
 In the club beef with some ni**as over some punk bit**, 
 They say wooly was caked up off some credit card scams, 
 Got him the permit, the ni**a took the money and ran, 
 Heard he was outta town ridin' round in the pound 
 Caught him spending 545 I no lie ask how, 
 Out on va, camron home, come through here cruise by, 
 He run in to dem ni**as that he beat, he gon die 
 Caught his crooks 'cause d flashin his mugshot, 
 He notices m.o. don run up in dem crack spots, 
 His sister, she aaight, big hips, lil waist, big tits, 
 Pretty face, we f***** on the staircase, 
 Lisa thatâss my bit** she freak off wid a ni**a, shit, 
 Man I gotta call that bit**! 
 (Chorus x2: 50 cent) 
 Maybe we crazy, but this is the way we came up, 
 Ni**a front, then somethin' gon go down, 
 Ni**a stunt, cruise to this bitch if you wan
