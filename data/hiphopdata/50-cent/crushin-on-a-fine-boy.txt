*Crushin... 
 On you boy... 
 *Come on over hear... 
 And taste this... 
 *Boy I'm watching you, everywhere you go 
 I see you at school, the parties too 
 *Why dontchu you notice me 
 I've been waiting for so long 
 *Just come taste my candy... 
 I've been cruchin on a boy like you 
 *I've been waiting for you to come through 
 Just go knock at my door 
 *I'll let you in for alittle more 
 Just take a sample of my candy... 
 Late at night all I think about is you 
 The way you smell and how your body looks too 
 I just can't get you outta my mind 
 I wanna taste your body all the time 
 Everyday when I see your smile 
 My body melts into an ice-cream pile 
 I get so nervous when you talk to me 
 But after all you make me so happy 
 I've been cruchin on a boy like you 
 *I've been waiting for you to come through 
 Just go knock at my door 
 *I'll let you in for alittle more 
 Just take a sample of my candy... 
 Alalalala... alalalala tastes like candy 
 Alalalala... alalalala sweet 'n' sexy 
 Boy wontchu taste my candy 
 It's so tastey and yummy 
 You will feel like you're in heaven 
 'Cause I'm cruching on you! repeat (2x)
