 She was hesitant at first 
 Said she never did it before 
 As soon as I got it going 
 She was going like a pro 
 She went up and down 
 Like a merry go round 
 And... round and round 
 And SPLASH 
 She was freaky freaky 
 When you get her in the bed 
 You need... g's like me to get her to give you head 
 My con-ver-sation is stim-u-lating 
 She in room 10-19 in the Hilt' and waiting 
 She got a thing for ballas 
 I mean a thing for balls 
 And I had turned her ass out 
 So I'm the one she calls 
 On the cheek she kiss me and she tell me she miss me 
 Bein' 'round me got her used to drinkin' don and cristy 
 I'ma special nigga 
 Look I'm used to blindin' 
 Keep that benz so clean and those three wheels shinin 
 (Can't be serious 4 in da mornin) 
 (Lloyd Banks) 
 Right in da mornin I rolled over 
 Guess who was over my shoulder 
 A pretty round, round (round) 
 Who just got finished goin' downtown 
 But at night wit no lights 
 I have you wonderin 
 If it's a lightin bug in your mouf 
 Or a glow-in-da-dark tongue ring 
 Banks needa ghetto chick 
 Set a nigga up wit ass 
 Sneak around till he fall asleep 
 Diggin in his stash 
 Leave wit everythin' 
 Rob a benz, stacks and da grass 
 Ass so fat, she get handclaps when she pass 
 I ain't never had a girl but you can be my bottom bitch 
 I'd been around da world 
 We don't hit no kinda chicks 
 Range rover, neva sober, hennessey, vanilla soda 
 B-A-N-K dolla' south bitch 
 I ain't here hopin that your baby daddy ova da shoulder 
 Banks don't associate wit no TRICKS 
 I'ma make it a G-Unit party 
 From the hotel lobby 
 And if you ain't tryin' to freak off 
 Then go home BITCH 
 (Young Buck) 
 You know what I came to do 
 Let you put your lips on my dick 
 But don't tell nobody 
 You my mistress bitch 
 All your friends keep tellin' you what to do 
 When you get me 
 Got to eat the nuts first 
 Like a hershey kisses 
 Bitch show me you miss me 
 Like I'm Pac or Biggie 
 She can be small as Eve 
 Or even big as Missy 
 I like it when them dykes 
 Indulge in group sex 
 Suck off banks and 50 and be like "you next" 
 Get your ass SUPLEXED 
 Tellin' me to go down 
 I'm a P-I-M-P bitch 
 I bet you know now 
 Baby girl slow down 
 You make a nigga cum quick 
 When you closed your eyes 
 And make your tongue 
 Do a twist 
 You my 3 o'clock, lolipop 
 Kiss the last drop bitch 
 Walk around naked hoe 
 I met your ass topless 
 She finally found out 
 What young buck is 'bout 
 So give a nigga from the south 
 Some of that mouth 
 (Come on girl, you know I got you) 
 All right then you playas 
 That down on the dial right now 
 We gone to give ya 
 Some real good game dog 
 Official dog, magic wand and whoo kid 
 We gon to do something ya know we gonna to do 
 We gon' to soda-pop 
 Ya know wat I'm talkin' bout if ya in tha game 
 So get ya soda poppin' ready 
 'Cause we gon' soda-pop round here
