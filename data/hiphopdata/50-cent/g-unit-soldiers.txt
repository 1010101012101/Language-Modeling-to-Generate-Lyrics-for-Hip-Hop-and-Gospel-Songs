 You can talk tough to them cowards that you pick on and beat up 
 And walk around town wit your whole fuckin' re-up (Yayo)

 And the Benz's complexion is cotton candy 
 I bounced up, that's the best part 
 You niggas don't know what pain is 
 The only scar on ya body's a stretch mark (stretch mark)

 Keep ya mouth shut, and keep ya ears open 
 'Cause it's liver than P-89s when we approachin (what else) 
 Listen homie

 For niggas in the hood playin' cowboys and indians 
 Ladies and gentleman we was born to ball 
 So if you see me in the club I'm in the bathroom stall 
 Gettin' oral sex she bless the huey all night 
 She got a georgous neck the way she toss this dick
