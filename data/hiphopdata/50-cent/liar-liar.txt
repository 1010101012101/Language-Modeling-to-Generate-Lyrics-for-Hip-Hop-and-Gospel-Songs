 And baby wen I told you your the sunshine of my life

 When I told u I liked you for everything you are 
 I meant I liked the way your tities sit up in your bra 
 Everything I said in your ear by the bar 
 Was just to get you in the backseat of my car 
 Your an inspiring actress girl you can go far 
 If you knu who I knu baby, u would be a star 
 But wen I told you had sexy lips, 
 I meant to say I bet you suck a good dick 
 And wen I said I was feelin' ya hips 
 I meant to say I bet ya like it like a dog 'n' shit 
 So tell me doc, am I really sick? 
 Wen bitches find out how I think they say I ain't shit 
 Wen I say I love it, I mean I like it alot 
 Wen I say I wanna fuck, I mean right on the spot

 U say it's your dick, then lick on the balls 
 Baby wen I told u, your the only one I liked 
 I meant to say, 
 I really wanna fuck tonight, I really wanna fuck tonight 
 And baby wen I told you your the sunshine of my life 
 I meant to say 
 Shawty I ain't no trick, bitch please, I ain't buying you shit 
 Wen I said, I missed u 
 I meant I ain't hit in awhile 
 Wen I say can I come over 
 I meant can I come knock you down 
 Wen I said just kiss it 
 I meant come on just suck me off 
 I said I'll take ya shopping 
 I meant I'll drive ya to the mall

 I'm doing big things 
 But I'm act like my money short

 I mean the jeans you wearing 
 I can't wait to take 'em off 
 I bet I get ya hot

 All way down to ya toes

 Now put your legs back 
 And hop on ya like a frog 
 Ull turn religious quick

 Baby wen I told u, your the only one I liked 
 I meant to say, 
 I really wanna fuck tonight, I really wanna fuck tonight 
 And baby wen I told you your the sunshine of my life 
 I meant to say 
 Shawty I ain't no trick, bitch please, I ain't buying you shit
