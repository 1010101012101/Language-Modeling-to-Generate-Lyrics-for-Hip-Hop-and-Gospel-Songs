Yeah! When I'm out in N.Y. boy it's blunts and Phillies 
 When I'm out in L.A. boy it's wraps and swishes 
 Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this 
 Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangster shit 
 Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this 
 Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangster shit 
 I'm in my lambo maggot 
 My fo fo fagget 
 Doors cliffed up I'm like go go gadget 
 See this shit I got on 
 Homie I'd hate to 
 My teflon on boy my government issue 
 I hit your vertebrate, bullet went through tissue 
 Your wife on the futon huggin her shit soon 
 Homie you a bitch you got feminime ways 
 Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days 
 I got four fifths and bananas on the case 
 They got more whips than a runaway slave 
 Me and yayo go back like some high top fades 
 When I made 50 mil Em got paid 
 When I made 60 mil Dre got paid 
 When I made 80 mil Jimmy got paid

 Now life is made 
 Said I ain't even got to rap, I'm filthy man 
 I'm laughin' straight to the bank with this (ha ha haha ha) x4 
 I'm laughin' straight to the bank with this 
 I think nothin' but hundred dollar bills on the bank role 
 I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold 
 Got off the street movin mongoose and hoes 
 Seven three capris old school 
 When I role ways pass fuck the toe 
 No more paltinum I'm wearing gold 
 I'm internationally known as the kid with the flow that brings enough dough 
 There's never enough dough shit I need more 
 Get that shit out the stove baby blue was dough 
 Fresh off the flow stash blocks by the dash 
 Some by the wall make the purple bring the green and fuck the law 
 I'm also raw I'm hot I'm sure I'm like the coolest motherfucka around the globe boy 
 I sent the club on fire I told ya I'm the general saluting his soldiers 
 I'm laughin' straight to the bank with this (ha ha haha ha) x4 
 I'm laughin' straight to the bank with this
