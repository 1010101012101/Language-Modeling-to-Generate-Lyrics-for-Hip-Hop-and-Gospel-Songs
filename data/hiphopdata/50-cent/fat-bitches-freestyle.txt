In the gym I see ya ass up on the stairmaster, 
 But you got it on level two bitch go a little faster 
 Look girl, I ain't gon lie, I'll tell you how I feel 
 They should to handcuff ya big ass to the treadmill 
 You wanna work out now, 'cause you know its gettin' hot 
 And ya big ass finna pop all up out a halter top 
 Find a right chick wearin some tight shit, its on 
 See ya ass wear some tight shit we like, she wrong 
 Don't get stuck on the thing they say 'cause it a nasty world 
 I ain't fuck'n with you anyway 'cause you know you's a nast girl 
 I ain't never ganna dicriminate so let me compliment your eyes
