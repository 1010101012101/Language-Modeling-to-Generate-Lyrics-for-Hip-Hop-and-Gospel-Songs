 Yo Ja quit it, your raps are ova

 You think You got drugs but Your "crack" was left on the table 
 Smoke it Ja, Go on inhale 
 All I need is a gun to fuckin' make bail 
 Yayo's comin' home soon, better beware

 Think you swallow X huh, what does it look like? 
 Mr.Gangsta thinks he needs to smoke to be gangsta, u ain't cook right?

 Venni Vetti Vecci was good, but now you're just not mean 
 I remember when I used to think you was sick 
 Now I know what you are, just a small dick 
 G-Unit got rap covered for many years 
 I'll dice you up like that guy from the bible chopped his ears 
 My gun is loaded with about enuff for your whole crew 
 1 shot kills you and the others die at the sight of you 
 Your mangled body lying in a heap on the floor 
 Ain't got anuff time to go say goodbye to your whore 
 G-G-G- G Unit man we got the best
