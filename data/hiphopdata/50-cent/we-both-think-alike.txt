 (50 Cent Verse) 
 I'm not gon' waste your time talkin' about shit that you know 
 I'm so hood that even when I try to hide it, it shows 
 I be grindin' girl I'm focused I be gettin' my dough 
 You know if it ain't the flow then it come from the O's 
 Plus a nigga like a pimp when it come to the hoes 
 Every hood every city all the gangstaz know 
 Front on me and you be gettin' hit up fo sho 
 I make it hot when its 20 motherfuckin' below 
 See with me in V.I.P you can twist and blow 
 When the champagne finished baby order some more 
 Keep her eye on ya close while you out on the floor 
 The way you move I have a nigga straight sniffin' some ??smoke?? 
 If you ready to roll shorty we could just roll 
 When you ready to go I be ready to go (uh oh) 
 See everything I do, I do on the low (uh oh) 
 So when we do our thing nobody will know (uh oh)

 (50 Cent Verse) 
 Now look I know you into the shiny things 
 The platinum chains and the diamond rings 
 The 24 inch chrome on the range 
 I see you in your projects buy your window payin' 
 Now shorty me and you we came up the same 
 The fact before rap I ain't have a thing 
 I hustled got my weed up now I'm sittin' on change 
 I mean I got money out that ass mayne 
 When niggaz get to beefin' I be laffin' 
 'Cause I can send my homiez through to blast 'um 
 Stick him with the ?? or just slash 'um 
 Now fool are you crazy that's what we ask 'um 
 But back with me 'n' you, you shorty decide a thang 
 First its off with the bra then it's the G-string (uh oh) 
 We leave it up to me then we do it my way (uh oh) 
 And get straight to it skip the four play (uh oh)
