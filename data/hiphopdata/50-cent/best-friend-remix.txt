Yeah! It's my tape man, listen to my tape 
 WOO! 
 I've waited I've waited 
 Time went by 
 All I did was cry 
 Silly 
 If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time) 
 Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine) 
 Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on) 
 Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend 
 If I was your best friend 
 First we get the talkin', then we get the touchin 
 If we get pass the phone games we'll be fuckin' 
 I kiss like the French, then put ma tongue in your ear 
 Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair 
 For me a different scenery just mean a different position 
 In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen 
 In the chopper or on the jet join the mile high club 
 I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love 
 (Olivia) 
 You said that I could call you whenever I needed some one to listen to me 
 That's why I'm here standing by your side cause your always come through for me 
 So many others tried to be where you are but they just wanted to do me 
 But you took your time and now I'm satisfied that's why I want you all to me 
 'Cause if you were my best friend id want you round all the time 
 Can I be your best friend I promise boy you'll be mine 
 I said he's just a friend baby it's not pretend either he is or he ain't my man 
 I said he's just a friend 
 If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time) 
 Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine) 
 Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on) 
 Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend 
 If I was your best friend 
 While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back 
 When you puttin' on your lotion I can help you with that 
 I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile 
 Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style 
 Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk 
 And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk 
 There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York 
 I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought 
 Separate C'mon 
 (Olivia) 
 I'm not affraid you explore my body 
 Ooh give me that feeling now we can watch some TV 
 Or play a CD mabye that sexual healing 
 You try to sing to me but your never on the key 
 But you do it just to appese me 
 Id rather spend my time wasting time with you 
 You ooh you make it so easy 
 'Cause if you were my best friend id want you round all the time (I'd want you round all the time) 
 Can I be your best friend I promise boy you'll be mine (please baby be mine) 
 I said he's just a friend baby it's not pretend either he is or he ain't my man 
 I said he's just a friend 
 We been better then friends 
 For a long time 
 Ain't no need to pretend 
 You'll always be mine 
 We been better then friends 
 For a long time 
 Ain't no fibbing or faking 
 You'll always be mine 
 If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time) 
 Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine) 
 Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on) 
 Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend 
 If I was your best friend
