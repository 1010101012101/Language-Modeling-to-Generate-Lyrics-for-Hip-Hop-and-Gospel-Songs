Its more mental then physical 
 Its more then sexin' we gotta connection 
 Be my angel and I'll be your protection 
 If you grind when I grind when I shine I see to it you shine 
 I'm all ears tell me what's on your mind 
 If you feel like I feel its real if I'm gettin' ahead of myself tell me chill 
 But if you let me touch ya I could touch ya how you need to be touched 
 Keep talkin' to me girl and I'm gon be the one that you trust 
 I'll bring them candles bring them roses and them boxes of candy 
 You bring them sorted flavored condoms and them edible panties 
 Yeah I'm street but I'm discreet baby I can keep a secret 
 You can show me what you hidin' in them Victoria Secrets 
 Gotta old soul so you know I listen to Marvin "Let's get it on" 
 I take it off for you no problem you can call when you need baby 
 And we can pass time on that cloud with the silver line number nine 
 I was raised in a way where the time was the day was to play hard to get babe 
 But then it changed suddenly man you came and took my breath away 
 I was caught in a vine at a time in the night where my life wasn't right babe 
 But then again suddenly suddenly you came and I was swept away 
 Ooh like a bird I just fly 'cause I'm free 
 Free to laugh free to love free to be 
 No rain comes down on me 
 This is what's happenin' 
 La la la la la la la 
 Floatin' all the time on cloud nine 
 La la la la la la la 
 High every night from your light 
 La la la la la la la 
 Floatin' all the time on cloud nine 
 La la la la la la 
 Now this can't be a faze it runs threw my veins 
 So I can't get it out of me it's so complete 
 Its makin' me feel like I'm the only one that it is 
 So I don't care where we lay anytime of the day any way it don't matter babe 
 This unexplainable feeling it's so soul healing 
 And I want it all over me 
 Ooh like a bird I just fly 'cause I'm free 
 Free to laugh free to love free to be 
 No rain comes down on me 
 This is what's happenin' 
 La la la la la la la 
 Floatin' all the time on cloud nine 
 La la la la la la la 
 High every night from your light 
 La la la la la la la 
 Floatin' all the time on cloud nine 
 La la la la la la 
 I like to lay around in the sun spendin' time 
 Sip on moses on a quite evenin' night 
 Get away on a trip catch a flight 
 When yo say to me I'm the only one you need 
 I let you taste my body spot just to teeze 
 I want to sing while you kiss all ova me 
 Ooh la la 
 La la la la la la la 
 Floatin' all the time on cloud nine 
 La la la la la la la 
 High every night from your light 
 La la la la la la la 
 Floatin' all the time on cloud nine 
 La la la la la la
