(50 cent) 
 This for the b-tches ni-er, 
 I'll do anything for you (I'll do x2) 
 I'll do anything you want me to (I'll do, do, do, do) 
 I'll do anything for you, 
 Me, I've dun been around the world 6 times, 
 A bad b-tch in every part of the world has been mine 
 But you can change me, baby you can change me, 
 Oh sh-t look I'm already not the same see, 
 Shorty you already make me feel brand new 
 I'm not fun and game girl I swear you do, 
 Too cold to hold and too hot to handle, 
 Me and you girl there is nothing we can't do, 
 You like girls, I like girls too, we got something in common, 
 Now how the hell could that be a problem, 
 Shorty lets laugh, lets dance, lets drink, lets puff right here, right now, 
 Shit we only live once 
 I should not be reprimanded I cannot be acclaimed, 
 My love's on level 10, I'm trying to get it in, 
 I have you coming down your candy walls, 
 Get you wetted in Niagara Falls, till you climax that's all, 
 You think I'm a fool, 'cause I do so many things for you, 
 I'll do anything, I'll do anything 
 Plus they don't know the reason 
 Why I do all the things I do for you 
 I mean you should be in f-king love with me, 
 Look at all this fly shit you got 
 I keep a bad b-tch on deck, 
 We retro drinking yeah sipping Moet, 
 But shorty got ass for days, 
 I smack you sit and watch you wave 
 Putting stress on my brain 
 And head game she likes the pain, 
 So good I kept buying her things, 
 Like tennis bracelets and chains, 
 Diamond rings

 I'm giving her the finer things, that's why she don't complain 
 I kinda got her open mayne (man), I stroke that thang, 
 I'm dipping into the globe, we international now, whoa 
 That's me and you, you ain't supposed to understand, 
 You know I say some sh-t, I ain't supposed to say but you know how I feel, 
 I should be an arsehole whenever I feel like, look at the sh-t I bought you, 
 Come on man, don't give me no headache... come at me with dat bullsh-t 
 I'll do anything for you girl.
