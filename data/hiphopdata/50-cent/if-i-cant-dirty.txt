Yeah... haha... yeah... yeah 
 If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done! 
 Now I'm'a let the champagne bottle pop 
 I'm'a take it to the top 
 Fo'sho I'm'a make it hot baby (baby) 
 I apply pressure to pussys that stuntin' I pop 
 Stand alone, squeezin ma pistol, I'm sure that I got em 
 Now peter piper picked peppers but don't rocked rhymes 
 I'm 50 cent, I write a lil' bit but I pop nines... 
 Tell niggas get they money right 'cause I got mine 
 And I'm around quit playin' nigga... u can't shine 
 U gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk 
 After bein' hit by the pump, is that what you want?? 
 Be easy nigga, I'll lay ur ass out! 
 Believe me nigga, that's what I'm about, gangsta! 
 U could find a nigga sittin' on chrome 
 Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas & I'm gone (yeah!) 
 If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done! 
 Now I'm'a let the champagne bottle pop 
 I'm'a take it to the top 
 Fo'sho I'm'a make it hot baby (baby) 
 I'm down for the action, he smart with his mouth so smack'em 
 U holdin' a strap, he might come back so clap'em 
 React like a gangsta, die like a gangsta for actin' 
 'Cause u'll get hit and homicide'll be askin, "what happened?" 
 Oh no! look who clappin' whit the fo-fo! 
 20 inch rims sittin' on low-chro! 
 Eastside, westside niggaz yo yo, I'm loco! 
 Even ma mama said, somethin' really wrong with my brain 
 Niggas don't rob me they know I'm down to die for ma chain 
 G-unit! (yeah!) we get it poppin' in the hood 
 G-unit! (yeah!) mothafucka what's good?? 
 I'm waitin' on niggas to act like they don't know how to act 
 I had a sip of too much jack, I'll blow'em off the map 
 With the mack, thinkin' it's all rap 
 Till that ass get clapped and doc say "it's a wrap nigga" 
 If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done! 
 Now I'm'a let the champagne bottle pop 
 I'm'a take it to the top 
 Fo'sho I'm'a make it hot baby (baby) 
 I been feelin' I had to teach lessons to slow learners 
 Go head act up, get smacked in the head with the burner 
 I don't fight fair, I'm dirty-dirty 
 I'm from southside jamaica, queens, nigga ya heard me?? 
 When streetlights come on niggas blast the nines 
 Get locked up, they read books to pass the time 
 In the game there's ups and downs, so I stay on the grind 
 Niggas on ma dick more than ma bitch, I stay on they mind 
 They ain't nothin' they could do to stop ma shine 
 This is god's plan homie, this ain't mine! 
 I played the music loud so grandpa called me a nuisance 
 And grandma, who always gotta throw in her 2 cents 
 I'm the drop out who made more money than his teachers 
 Ruthless like the coupe but I come with more features 
 I am what I am, u could like it or love it! 
 It feels good to pull 50 grand and think nothin' of it... 
 Fuck it! 
 If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done! 
 Now I'm'a let the champagne bottle pop 
 I'm'a take it to the top 
 Fo'sho I'm'a make it hot baby (baby) 
 If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done! 
 Now I'm'a let the champagne bottle pop 
 I'm'a take it to the top 
 Fo'sho I'm'a make it hot baby (baby)
