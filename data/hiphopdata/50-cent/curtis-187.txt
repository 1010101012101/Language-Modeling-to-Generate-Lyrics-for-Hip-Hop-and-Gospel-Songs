(Chorus - 50 Cent) 
 They say I'm grimey, I'm greasy 
 I make a 187 look easy 
 Fuck that, I lay my murder game down 
 Push me nigga, see what I'm about 
 (Verse 1 - 50 Cent) 
 I was a snotty nose, nappy head, dirtbomb nigga 
 Sayin' I can't wait till I get a little bigger 
 Half the niggas jumped me, bumpin' my head 
 Thinkin' I wish I had a gun I fill a nigga with lead 
 Took a kitchen knife, I'm finna poke me a nigga 
 Wishin' I had a gun so I could smoke me a nigga 
 Sold my first five quarter gram pieces in the alley 
 Where Bizzy had the Bondeville and Kev had the caddy 
 Now those were the days, where crime really pay 
 9 milly spray, got the xx out the way 
 The shootout, the shootout 
 The bricks went fast, robberies went bad, niggas got blast 
 Niggas kidnap Drew granpa kid 
 Came through and shot Ms Leak in the head 
 Wonder why I got a gun so I can get down for mine 
 You need that, out on the grind all the time 
 (Chorus - 50 Cent) 
 They say I'm grimey, I'm greasy 
 I make a 187 look easy 
 Fuck that, I lay my murder game down 
 Push me nigga, see what I'm about 
 They say I'm grimey, I'm greasy 
 I make a 187 look easy 
 Fuck that, I lay my murder game down 
 Push me nigga, see what I'm about 
 (Verse 2 - 50 Cent) 
 It was kangos, caselli shades, boombers and corn brades 
 Do rags on the waist, brass knuckles, switch blades 
 E-mass to get paid, new shells to get sprayed 
 Hood rats to get laid, money to get made 
 Yeah, yeah I had a dream I was rich 
 Woke up broke, gun in my hand 
 Sayin' "Damn!" this dope cost 60 a gram 
 Have to find me a nigga, line me a nigga 
 And say "Give it up kid, before I put one in ya wig" 
 Picture me thirsty, ridin' round foamin' out the mouth 
 Sayin' "I don't get on" I'm'a lay a nigga out 
 Now diamonds are beautiful, pearls are precious 
 I hit ya in ya bitch, both go for ya necklace 
 I'm so wreckless, I play the semi drunk off henny 
 Wipe your blood off the shines run and sell 'em to Benny 
 Fuck with me, ya niggas know Boo Boo get bizzy (Chorus - 50 Cent) 
 They say I'm grimey, I'm greasy 
 I make a 187 look easy 
 Fuck that, I lay my murder game down 
 Push me nigga, see what I'm about 
 They say I'm grimey, I'm greasy 
 I make a 187 look easy 
 Fuck that, I lay my murder game down 
 Push me nigga, see what I'm about 
 (Verse 3 - 50 Cent) 
 I gave Jus a buck 50 ask him If I cut niggas 
 Shootouts in Bedford ask him If I bucked niggas 
 Four fifth they call me Boo Boo, the accident baby 
 Hennysee and Cocaine, those remedies made me 
 My eyes don't cry, I'm a fatherless child 
 Got my xxx whooped in Spotford but never that now 
 When my name in ya mouth, better watch how you talk 
 Send yo punk xxx to therapy to learn how to walk 
 I bust a clip Ill hit ya hip 
 I'm take your shit 
 That's how the esse's play, for that s.s.k 
 Your probably heard through the grape vine, I'm good out Watts 
 Bulletproof shit, cruisin' through the Compton blocks 
 I'm the beast from the east, but I play on the west 
 In the drop by myself with my gun and my vest 
 And you niggas best be on your best behaviours 
 I was bread for this shit, front I'm'a blaze ya (Chorus - 50 Cent) 
 They say I'm grimey, I'm greasy 
 I make a 187 look easy 
 Fuck that, I lay my murder game down 
 Push me nigga, see what I'm about
