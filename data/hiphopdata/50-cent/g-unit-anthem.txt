 Tony Yayo: 
 In my hood you get no points for your jumpshot 
 As soon as the sun rise, we back on the block 
 This stress got me feelin' like an old man 
 And I stay on point for that red and gold van 
 It's the free lance performer YaYo be a pro 
 'Cause the flows been hot, since G.I. Joe 
 Yo my rhyme will have you noddin, like Raw in the Street 
 So freaks gimme ass like toilet seats 
 Get at me, you really think you holding big daddy? 
 So where's ur in door courts, and bowling ally? 
 I got heart like a hoover crip, but bust slugs like an IngleWood Blood 
 I mengle wit Thugs, my single will buzz 
 Import, export get rid of tha drugs 
 Styll pack my Dope up witta mass of some gloves 
 I use to have 8-balls in my 8-Ball jacket 
 Now I dawg lex coops, like dukes and luke of Hazard 
 Lloyd Banks: 
 I put carpet Burns on these Waxters these days 
 Till they need bandages on they knees like Pat Ewings Legs 
 I'm always wit a bisquit 
 Only way I get blue balls, is if a bitch had blue lipstick 
 U broke rob more blocks 
 U ain't gotta know how to break dance, to whind up on a card board box 
 Gucci down to my sock, groupies hound to dey spots 
 Different format, keep groupies round for tha cops 
 She'll be down for tha watch, I ain't generous or courtieous 
 I'm running from a dirty bitch, nigga you thirty-six 
 Y'all don't want it with tha kid at all 
 Same shit, bigger bathrooms my niggaz brawll 
 When we come after u, it ain't no graze shots 
 This nigga leave a HOLE in ya chest bigger than flava-Flave Clock 
 You pussy, I think even Pac can smell this shit 
 Cause on the inside you softer than a mozerella stick (bitch) 
 50 Cent: 
 I'm the leader of the New School now nigga wut! 
 I got the4-4 pull out tear yo bitch ass up 
 I pop-rob nigga front I out my knife in yo gut 
 Have you in I.C.U screaming Ah! I'm cut 
 I go RAH-RAH, like a dungeon dragon 
 But I keep my pistol on me so my pants ain't sagging 
 Everytime I'm in the house, niggaz grill a nigga 
 But they feel a nigga, 'cause I'll kill a nigga 
 Ooh squeeze, shorty better stay out my lane 
 Before I send one of my soldiers to blow out ur brain 
 Ima General (wut!) niggaz solute me 
 U a dead man if you attempt to shoot me 
 I done lost some of my brain watchin military flicks 
 Got the whole G-Unit on some Military shit 
 (Private Banks request permission to speak)
