Man I'm gonna do my thing, 
 It's crazy in the club when I'm in there, man 
 Trust me homie, I'm not playin' 
 The dance floor of the chain I say (Get Up!) 
 I came to bring you that California Love 
 In the middle of New York, 
 Haters all of the above. 
 I'm not playin' I said I'm off the chain 
 You niggers better follow instructions, I say (Get up!) 
 I ball till I fall 
 I stunt till I drop 
 I'm off the showroom floor, 
 Not the used car lot. 
 You buy a bottle, 
 I but the bar. 
 I make any other week feel like Mardi Gras. 
 When I get into, I get into it 
 Everybody can't do it the way I do it 
 I make it rain, then the sun comes out. 
 A nigger playin' then the guns come out, now 
 My question is who they goin' to blame 
 When I' back number one on that billboard again. 
 Shit chip now The Game don't change. 
 Since Mike made Triller and Prince made Purple Rain. 
 I guess I make they kids want slangin, 
 Then N.W.A. made the West Coast bangin' 
 Nah, It's just music 
 Man it's just music 
 Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it 
 I have the savoir-faire 
 I'm the reason everybody here I say (Get Up!) 
 I make it hot I make it hot in here 
 Your feet hurting I really don't care 
 I say (Get up!) 
 I wanna see, I wanna see you move 
 And get on a little groove 
 I said (Get up!) 
 I'm getting money man I really don't care 
 Now lemme see you put your hands in the air I say (Get Up!) 
 You look good, I want to get to know you better 
 You look good in them jeans and them red stilletos 
 You got a Bentley Coup booty baby I wanna drive 
 See I tell you what your mileage is just when I'm inside 
 I wanna take you for a spin, you know round and round 
 Switch gears until your love come down 
 I take you to the point of no return, 
 If you listen you learn, 
 Just how a nigger earn 
 I got money to burn. 
 While The Game ban bitched 
 She dropped the bomb on me 
 She suck it down and up and down, gracefully 
 Rick James would have said she a brick house 
 But 50 you should go ahead and see what that bitch bout'. 
 I found out she like hard I like it huh 
 Back it up and get you some 
 I know how to get you sprung 
 Tune you up 
 Pierce your tongue 
 Under the hood it's so good 
 She said so good god damn I'm so good 
 Nigga what up? 
 I have the savoir-faire 
 I'm the reason everybody here I say (Get Up!) 
 I make it hot I make it hot in here 
 Your feet hurting I really don't care 
 I say (Get up!) 
 I wanna see, I wanna see you move 
 And get on a little groove 
 I said (Get up!) 
 I'm getting money man I really don't care 
 Now lemme see you put your hands in the air I say (Get Up!) 
 And get into it 
 You now rock the building you know that 
 I said (Get Up!) 
 And get into it 
 Imma show you just how we do it 
 I said (Get Up!) 
 Aftermath, still Shady aftermath 
 I said (Get Up!) 
 Aftermath, still Shady aftermath
