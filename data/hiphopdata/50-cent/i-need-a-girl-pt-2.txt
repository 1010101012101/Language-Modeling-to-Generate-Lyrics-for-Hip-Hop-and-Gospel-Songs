Yo you know me I'm a straight-up nigga 
 So I tell a bitch exactly what I wanna do ya knah sayin'? 
 If I'm in a club and I'm tryin' to go home I'm like "Yo ma wassup" 
 Ya know get wit you ya know 
 I mean tonight tho, not like next month 
 None of dat other shit ya knah sayin'? 
 But you know every now and then I be lyin' 
 I ain't gonn front, I be lyin' to the hoes man 
 I can tell a bitch exactly what she wanna hear 
 (Verse 1 - 50 Cent) 
 I wanna be the reason you smile after you wipe ya tears 
 The reason you have the courage to confront ya fears 
 The reason there's 2 karats in each of ya ears 
 I'll splurge wit the paper ma, I don't care 
 How you like it, pumps or boots? 
 Jeeps or Coupes? Minks or leathers? 
 50 fall off never 
 What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine 
 'Cause when I shine, you shine c'mon 
 Fine champange, we can toast to life 
 Crap table in Vegas you could toss the dice 
 Don't let ya friends get you confused, sayin' "50 bad news" 
 I need you in my life girl, ya too much to lose 
 Ay Puffy stop makin' them muthafuckin "I miss J.Lo" records nigga 
 Yo Chi, turn this shit off man I ain't feelin' this shit right now 
 Put sum hard shit on 
 --Beats switches-- 
 Yeah c'mon uh hahaha yo 
 (Chorus 2x - 50 Cent) 
 Nigga you won't deny that I'm a fuckin' rider 
 You don't wanna bump heads wit me 
 I'll put a hole in yo ass you'll see 
 That it ain't cool to fuck wit me 
 (Verse 2 - Tony Yayo) 
 G Unit... I roll wit gorillaz 
 Fuck a big bodyguard I hang wit pint-sized killers 
 I ain't tryin' to be dirty - still on the strip 
 I'm tryin' to be dirty - filthy rich 
 Give a nigga too much rope he think he a cowboy 
 Give him too much dope I'm pushin a big boy 
 V-12 XL detail 
 I rap and wait for dem checks in the mail 
 And if you hatin' in due time ya life will expire 
 'Cause my guns speak Jamaican they be like "Bloodfire!" 
 Where I'm from niggas be on sum sneak shit 
 When hungry use they lighters to cook they beef stick 
 And its dro and its Nestle, got me right 
 So my lungs be as black as Wesley Snipes 
 I'm on first class flights headed towards Vegas 
 Not slot machine niggas, we crap table playas 
 I roll a 7 'cause we crap table playas 
 (Verse 3 - Lloyd Banks) 
 I know alot of niggas want Banks gone 
 But my kinda beef'll fuck up ya grill and not the kind you put franks gone 
 I'm hot now so my meals is home-cooked 
 I deal wit more hoes than a Chinese phonebook 
 You hidin wit ya messed-up ratchets 
 I'm out blowin' haze bags the size of ketchup packets 
 Fuck Uz' in ya ride, this tool's on my side 
 Got females standin' wit tattoos on her thighs 
 Visualize cats losin they wives 
 'Cause the next time I see 'em they got black and blues on they eyes 
 Nah I ain't ready to die but I'm prepared 
 I'd rather grow old wit gray hairs in my bed 
 They know me in the field, the kid wit the fans 
 That argue over my balls like Kobe and Shaquille 
 If you talkin' bout millions throw me in the deal 
 Big city stadium tour roll me in the wheels muhfucka...
