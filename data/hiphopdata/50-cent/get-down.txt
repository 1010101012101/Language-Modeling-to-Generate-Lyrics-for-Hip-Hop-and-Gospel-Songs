(Feat. tony yayo, hot rod) 
 Yeah 
 When its on you better, get get g-get get down! 
 Get get g-get get down! 
 I pull out you better, get down! 
 I let off you better, get down! 
 Get get g-get get down! get get g-get get down! 
 When its on you better, get down! 
 I pull out you better, get down! 
 (Verse 1: 50 cent) 
 It might take seven days and six nights before I get right 
 I get comfy and I lean on them put that beam on them 
 You probably heard mase try to join the team 
 Cause puff was to busy sellin pimple cream 
 The perfume is next with maybelline 
 Or dance next to joc to try and get hot 
 This is the quiet before the storm, the warning before its on 
 50 back on that shit, 50 finna to flip 
 (Verse 2: tony yayo) 
 They don't do it like this concentrate on the wrists 
 I got see-through rocks on the kroto-swiss 
 I got rich real quick now I'm sippin on cris 
 Its t - o - n - y, g-unit is the clique 
 When I'm about to click (gun cock) that's the hammer on the pound 
 So ya better get get g-get down! 
 On the greyhound and now I'm on the run 
 'Cause I ain't goin' down for no damn murder one! 
 (Verse 3: hot rod) 
 When I roll through the hood man it's all good 
 These hoes get down when I show 'em my wood 
 Niggas get down 'cause they knowin' they should 
 When them things spit rounds they flow through the hood 
 If you's a hard nigga you feelin' you gotta proof it 
 I run with the unit, please man don't do it 
 Act tough now you have to duck down 
 You hit the lotto last week you out of luck now nigga! 
 (Verse 4: 50 cent) 
 I kiss money, money I got 
 The strawberry daquiri the same colour the drop 
 You can see a nigga clear when I put down the top 
 Sunlight hit the watch you see the shit down the block 
 Any bright colour vs, my shit right 
 My shits is diamonds, yours bouts and knights -??? 
 I know your plan was to fake it till you make it 
 But ima blow your ass up and that's all the shit
