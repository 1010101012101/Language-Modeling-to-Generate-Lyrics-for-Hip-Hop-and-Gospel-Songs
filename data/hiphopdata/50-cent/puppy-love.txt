Puppy Love 
 50 Cent 
 Call It Puppy Love Curtis and Tisha in the tree 
 K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
 She was pregenant by me once glad she didn't have it 
 'Cause I be paying child support now god damn it 
 Tish was my bitch, till she fucked my god brother 
 I was heated when I heard, wanted to go upside his head 
 It was christmas I just bought the bitch a sheepskin kid 
 I was sick to my stomach nigga this is real shit 
 I ain't the sensitive type, I ain't sit around crying 
 I caught the bitch on the avenue and punched her in the eye 
 Call it puppy love curtis and Janelle in the tree 
 K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
 D's came locked my ass up like a savage 
 Then came Doobie in the baby carriage 
 Imagine how it felt summerday pretty blue skies 
 I gazed mesmorizied at her in with green eyes 
 I'm so into you baby we don't even got touch 
 That the type shit I say when I really want to fuck 
 Cause her cousin Tisha lived by baby ????????? forty 
 Sold crack before rap so everbody know me 
 Chase Jus down cut his head the motherfucker owe me 
 Vick's spinning, Cheek's was the hottest rapper in the hood 
 I ain't hate, but on the low I didn't think he was good 
 We wore timberland boots, carhartt suits 
 You can tell a nigga paid, when his filas shoes suede 
 Ock a ceaser or a fade kept a pistol or a blade 
 Try to flip a 62 like every couple days 
 I get knocked I come home it's all a part of the game 
 Catch a snitch, cut a snitch or put one in his frame 
 It's like every other summer I was back and forth to jail 
 Telling nanna I'm copping out, so I don't need bail 
 Just the convesary put the money orders in the mail 
 Call it puppy love curtis and Deawn in the tree 
 K-i-s-s-i-n-g 
 Call it puppy love 
 Call it puppy love 
 She came to see me on the alley, wrote me letters all the time 
 And I responded to the letters so she stayed on my mind 
 Told myself Ima grind 
 As soon as I get out that paper what I'm about 
 After 4 months home I had the Lan I shine 
 2 months later I copped the benz my nine 
 Stay all cocked even when it hot, TAZ out 
 TNT on the block, make yourself get knocked 
 I just love 'em and leave em, I don't give a fuck 
 I mean she didn't give a fuck, she had a nigga in my truck 
 Call it puppy love curtis and Shaniqua in the tree 
 K-I-S-S-I-N-G
