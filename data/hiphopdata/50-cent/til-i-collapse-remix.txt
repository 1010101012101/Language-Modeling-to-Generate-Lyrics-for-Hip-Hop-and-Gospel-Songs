G-g-g G Unit! 
 50 Cent 
 Shady 
 Aftermath 
 The Dream Team 
 We gotta get the "Get Well" cards 
 Niggas is sick 
 Feel this 
 Motion picture shit 
 (50 Cent) 
 Now don't think I won't hit ya 'cause I'm popular 
 I got a P90 ruger, gonna pop at ya 
 Catch ya slippin', I'mma give ya what I got for ya 
 My clip loaded with 16 shots for ya 
 You ever had a hot gun on your waste and blood on your shoe 
 'Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you 
 Homie you ain't been through, what I been through 
 You not like me and I'm not like you (ha!) 
 I'm like an animal with it when I spit it, it's crazy 
 Got semi-autos and put holes in niggas tryna play me 
 One shot is not enough, you need at least an uzi to move me 
 After four bottles of "Don," the kid start feelin' woozie 
 I write my life, you write what you seen in gangsta movies 
 I'm gangsta to the core, nigga you can't move me 
 I find my space at the top 
 I got this rap shit locked 
 I never heard of you, you heard of me 
 I murder you, spray shells through your convertible 
 Lotus, you notice 
 Rich or poor, hollows still go through your door 
 This is war 
 You scared of me, you not prepared for me 
 The kid is back, 50 Cent 
 I know you like that, yeah I know you like that 
 (Eminem) 
 Soon as a verse starts I eat at MC's heart 
 What is he thinkin' how not to go against me smart 
 And its absurd how people hang on every word 
 I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve 
 But I'll never be served 
 My spot is forever reserved 
 If I ever leave earth 
 That would be the death of me first 
 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' 
 Could ever be worse 
 That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse 
 My thoughts are sporatic 
 I act like I'm an addict 
 I rap like am addicted to smack 
 Like I'm kim mathers 
 But I don't wanan go forth and back 
 In constant battles 
 The fact is I would rather sit back 
 And bomb some rappers 
 So this is like a full blown attack 
 I'm launching at 'em 
 The track is on some battleing 
 Rap who want some static 
 'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters 
 A plaque in platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest 
 Till the roof comes off 
 Till the lights go out 
 Till my legs give out 
 Can't shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out 
 And my high burns out 
 I'ma rip this shit 
 Till my bone collapse 
 Till the roof comes off 
 Till the lights go out 
 Till my legs give out 
 Can't shut my mouth 
 Till the smoke clears out 
 And my high burns out 
 I'ma rip this shit 
 Till my bone collapse 
 Until the roof, the roof comes off 
 Until my legs, give out from underneath me 
 I, I will not fall 
 I will stand tall 
 Feels like no one can beat me
