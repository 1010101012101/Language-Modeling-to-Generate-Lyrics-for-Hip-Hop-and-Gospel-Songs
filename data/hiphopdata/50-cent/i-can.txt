I Know I Can 
 Be what I wanna be 
 If I work hard and get 
 I be where I wanna be

 Boys and Girls listen up 
 You can be anything in the world 
 In God we trust an Artictec, Doctor maybe an Actress 
 But nothing comes easy it take much practice 
 Like I meet woman who's becoming a star 
 She was very beautiful leaving people in awww 
 Singing song leanin horn but with the yellow version 
 Hung with the wrong person got 
 Stiffen up drugs all in the nose 
 Could of died so young 
 Know look ugly and old 
 No fun cause now when she reaches for a hugs 
 People hold there breath 
 'Cause she smells like corrosion and death 
 Watch the company you keep and the crowed you bring 
 'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing 
 So if you gonna be the best ima tell you how 
 Put your hand into the air and take a bow 
 I know I can 
 I know I can 
 Be what I wanna be 
 Be what I wanna be 
 If I work hard and get 
 If I work hard and get 
 I be where I wanna be 
 I be where I wanna be 
 I know I can

 Be what I wanna be 
 Be what I wanna be 
 If I work hard and get 
 If I work hard and get

 Boys and Girls listen again 
 This is for grown looking girls who only ten 
 The one who watch video and do what they see 
 As cuteiste can be up in the club with fake i.d. 
 Careful before you meet a men with H.I.V. 
 You can host a TV like Orpra Winfree 
 What ever you decide be careful some men be rapist or at your age don't betted to be older then you are give yourself time to grow you thinking he can give you wealth 
 But so... 
 Young boys you can use a lot of help you know 
 You thinkin' life is all about smokein (pot) and ice 
 You don't want to be my age and can't read or wright begging different women for a place to sleep at night 
 Smart boy turn emmm in and do whatever they wish 
 If you believe you can achieve then say it like this 
 I know I can

 Be what I wanna be

 If I work hard and get 
 If I work hard and get 
 I be where I wanna be
