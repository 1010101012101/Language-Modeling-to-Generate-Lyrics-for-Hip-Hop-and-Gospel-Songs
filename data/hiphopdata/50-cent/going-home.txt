I've had my troubles and I've had my trials, sometimes I wondered if 
 I would make it one more mile but he left a promise and I believe oh 
 Why should I worry with the sinful world I'm getting ready to leave. 
 Ch-He's coming back, and I'm going home, soon I'm gonna see the 
 Face of the one I've waited for so long one of these mornings you look 
 For me and I'll be gone, cause hes coming back, and I'm going home. 
 2- The coming of Jesus would not be so dear, if I knew that when he 
 Came back I would have to stay down here oh but he is preparing a 
 Mansion just for me and I am gonna live in that heavenly home through 
 Out eternity 
 Repeat ch2x
