I make millions quick, and I don't 
 Wanna talk about it 
 I shoot a nigga kid, and I don't 
 Wamma talk about it 
 I fuck the baddest bitches, I don't 
 Wanna talk about it 
 I'm still flippin chickens, I don't 
 Wanna talk about it 
 (50) 
 Go head and ask me what I'm riddin in 
 So I can say the Enzo, my bitch roll down 
 The window so I can feel the wind blow 
 Gotta be big enough to fit all my kin folk 
 Bitches with me cruzin, Moulin Rougin' 
 They fuckin' and they strippin nigga, I ain't 
 Even trippin' nigga 
 Me I handle business, God's my only witness 
 Watchin homicide sayin' who the fuck did dis 
 Me I run the street mane, so I keep the heat mane 
 Your soul is what you reap, when you fuck with the 
 Elite mane 
 I don't fuck around boy, you better ask around boy 
 I'll hit you with the pound, leave your ass on the 
 Ground for, you poppin' that bullshit like I don't 
 Pull shit 
 Fully-Loaded clips and whips, get the grip, flip the 
 Bricks 
 Nigga we hittin licks, stickin shit, gettin' rich 
 That's why my name ring bells all round this bitch 
 Any hood you go through they know 50 Cent
