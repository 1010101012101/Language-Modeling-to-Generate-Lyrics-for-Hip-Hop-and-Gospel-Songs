Just another day living in the hood 
 Just another day around the way 
 Feelin' good today 
 Check it out, look 
 They say rap is like a trap 
 So I'm lookin' for the map to the back door 
 Sometimes I sit and wonder what the fuck I'm rapping for 
 So many cats more talented and never had a chance at it 
 Not to mention niggas tryna damage it 
 Cold hearted vandalists, fuckin' up the culture 
 They acting like its cosher to rap for the advantages 
 Making the game scandalous 
 Straying so far from the art 
 You start to wonder if they ever was a fan of it 
 I'm digging in the crates with the candles lit 
 Lookin' for a record to describe my anger so I can sample it 
 Condense my feelings into sixteen bars 
 And try to sugarcoat my quotes or they won't seem raw 
 And I can tell what all your folk's dreams are 
 Cause all the video shows is hoes jockin' niggas knockin' they cars 
 Now the youngins want a piece of the pie 
 So the devil let some starve 'n' start feeding em' lies 
 Now try to digest that 
 And you wonder why we buy stress sacks 
 The shit out when niggas dish out without exlax 
 We tryna get out the west coast black 
 It's a bad place to raise fam and I'll be damned if I ever get back 
 Where shit's at now 
 It'd make martin luther shake his head and sit back down 
 Like "Did y'all niggas have the same dream" 
 And malcom x would wonder "are y'all on the same team" 
 The way these fiends keep drowning off in the mainstream 
 The lame thing about it is the same teams that bought it 
 Are probably skippin' this song 
 Building walls around their ignorance defending what's wrong 
 Instead of fighting for freedom 
 That's why I only write what I believe in 
 And nothing less 
 "Another" "1", "Another" "2", "Another "3" "Whatchu gon do" 
 "Another" "4", "Another" "5", "Another day" "Stayin alive was no jive" 
 I should have listened when my moms told my ass stay in class 
 Shoulda listened instead of ditching to get a little ass 
 Or maybe I shoulda listened to my pops 
 When he told me hip hop won't do shit but keep me on the block 
 Or maybe I should listen to my niggas pitchin' rocks 
 'Cause they pushin' nice whips from cookin' white bricks 
 Or maybe I should be like my uncle 
 That nigga pimpin' white chicks 
 But none of them lead a life like this 
 It's like the right do right just to try to stay the fuck outa hell 
 But for me, I'm trying to stay the fuck out of jail 
 'Cause I can smell trouble comin' my way 
 Plus there's so many reasons a nigga wanna keep a gun at his waist 
 And it don't take much to make them pull out 
 Cause niggas die for they rides, money and broads, or callin' the wrong hood out 
 And suckas still trippin' on colors like a mutha fuckin' racist 
 My cousin was bangin' at my aunt's cookout 
 It's a full out war and I don't know who to listen to 
 I thought rap was a positive gap that I could get into 
 But nowadays you gotta bust a cap if they dissin' you 
 Either that or be labled a bitch cause you didn't shoot 
 It's hard to pick and choose right from wrong 
 Like if you rap about freedom nobody likes your song 
 But do a track about cheating, bitches will play it all night long 
 See I don't get it why the rightous fall 
 Like my ex used to bump Xzibit 
 And her favorite line was "i be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings" 
 Yet she don't want me trickin' around 
 See she idolize the lifestyle but don't want none of it goin' down 
 It's kinda like these phony clowns thinkin' they hood dwellers 
 Actin' mafioso 'cause they seen Good Fellas 
 Now they runnin' through the hood yellin' blu is buckin' round 
 Bet you givin' your attention to me now
