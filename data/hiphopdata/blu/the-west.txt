Ayo, crusin' down Weston with them colourful hats 
 Gold and that black such a lovable match 
 The rap huxtable, comfy like bubbles and baths 
 Wasn't fucking with the putting brown bubbles in bags 
 I'm from the West, my flag got them brown bear on it 
 Sagged and rocked rags when my folks ain't condone it 
 When the folks in the stones was opponents I was postin' in my room 
 Staring at the wall 
 Wishing I was a baller, or a little bit taller 
 Now I'm 6'4 I want a 64' Impala 
 System serving the city 
 City staining walls up 
 Thinking bout my father when I look at that revolver 
 Nigga, ayo 
 Peeling off Crenshaw, Crippin' with Co$$ 
 [?] Be the boss 
 I'm trying not to floss the hog sauce or the HÃ¤agen-Dazs 
 Hopping off, holla at me, had 
 Mad personality, swag on 
 Vernon Ave, Trojan on the Trojan cap 
 Orange juice Simpson 
 Imma murk that 
 Circled back I seen her, she bendy, she kinda bad 
 If she don't know your boy tell her to hop in the back 
 I keep the chrome strap under both seats like my og 
 Cold streets put the heat back where it's supposed to be 
 Rollin' through the drive-in and we were loking 
 My niggas wasn't supposed to be back there 
 The West, the west, the west 
 Sitting on Slauson for the fish and the bread 
 C's on my head like the Cincinnati Reds 
 Fucking niggas on my business like the feds 
 I'm like Chauncey Billups is [?] 
 I called med just to get me some meds 
 Cough phlegm, cough red, gangrene to the head 
 Same thing to [?] 
 Now stranded on Weston like a weston with a 
 Bold sweater yo[?] 
 Chicks was all pepper 'cause she knew I'd sweat her 
 If I was a regular 
 But I'm a G I threw that letter up 
 Cali's a G too I met her once 
 She told me when all them west Africans stay here, they cheddar up 
 Gave her gold and some child born flesh and blood 
 Called them Blu just to prove the west won
