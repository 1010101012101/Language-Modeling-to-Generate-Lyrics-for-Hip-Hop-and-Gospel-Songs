My discovery different 
 16's made a way, if you want it, you get it 
 A couple wasn't as lucky but if you love it, you live it 
 Throwing ones in the john, makes you pumping the liquid 
 OK, rediscover me, I just be what I should be 
 A king... my thing work like a charm but if this genie up and leave 
 My friends work with the bomb and I just need what I just need 
 It's whatever for this living if this living sublime 
 How they living in the maybes, subliminal lines 
 The subliminals they giving you is different from mine 
 'Cause I don't get you no subliminals, my shit is defined 
 And if you don't get it today, then shit, get in the line 
 And as you scroll through your calendar you'll get it in time 
 They say a five-year plan is at the end of this line 
 And I'm just tryna find the heart that starts giving you kind 
 Rediscover 
 Discover yourself, uncover what else 
 When it's done, did you do it for the love or the wealth? 
 If you love it could you do it if it's stuck on a shelf? 
 Look in the mirror and still fuck with yourself, never somebody else? 
 It's taking me hell to be king just like Martin Luther 
 Except I had a dream, you steam, I might have to shoot you 
 They blinded and tweet, you turn the other cheek 
 To try to keep the casualties count, the murder and the peak 
 No surrender, no retreat, all it's left to discover is gaining insight and knowledge 
 Ascertaining one another, still remain if you my brother 
 The fakes wither away, even the radio, the video, the stakes still the same 
 Real name, no gimmicks, attain no image 
 Used to scream fuck the world till I... should I say so vivid, it's easy to see 
 It's like the LPs on DVD, rediscover 
 They used to call me Guantanamo 
 Put the underlay on your Ebok, quick as a cheetah 
 Rediscover me, Discovery channel on Coco Channel 
 Smelling like an animal, you can tell I'm rocking well, Norman Rockwell 
 But not for sale, Andy Warhol and all the color girls say that it's a work of art 
 You can never stop it, but who cares? Tomorrow I spit a hollow 
 He stuck... damn, barrel brothers
