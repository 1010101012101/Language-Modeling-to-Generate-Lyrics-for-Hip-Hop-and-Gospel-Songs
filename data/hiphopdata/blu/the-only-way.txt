Blu - The Only Way 
 Album: Johnson and Jonson 
 Producer: Mainframe 
 (The only way) to make it out this jungle is to juggle jobs or hustle 
 'Cause if not you gotta struggle dog 
 (I can get through the day) I'm taking out some time to pray 
 Trying to find the lines to say to y'all but only found a couple bars 
 (Is to make our lives) A little better by staying humble 
 I still hear my Grandpa mumble "stay outta trouble, boy" 
 (Like it was yesterday) Cause these days I sit and wonder 
 How I manage to handle myself from keepin' going under the edge 
 (I get up in the morning) I brush my teeth and get a bite to eat 
 I shower half an hour now I'm back on my feet 
 (After crying all night long) Cause this song reminded me of my peeps 
 I pour some liquor for my nigga, rest in peace 
 (Laughin' and talkin') For hours about the current state of all this 
 Bullshit flooding the market yet they call themselves artists? 
 (Like there ain't nothing wrong) Please! Heartless muthafuckin partners 
 Creating schemes to make our dreams seem smaller and smaller 
 ('Cause if I ever) Have a chance to make a change I will 
 And I ain't layin down my soul for gold or any forms of bills, forget it 
 I'm in this business to strip it of all its limits 
 And live it so all is finished on a road called its limits 
 (The lonely/only way) To make it out this motherfuckin ghetto 
 Without hustling drugs or busting metal 
 (I can get through the day) Is by praying before my mission starts 
 Giving heart and soul to every piece of scroll I've written off 
 (Is to make our life) A little worth living on earth 
 God has given us a choice and I've chosen to make it work 
 (Like it was yesterday) Like when we used to use our brains 
 Now we're losing our minds, grinding for change instead of changing it 
 (I get up in the morning) And go to work without change 
 And spit a verse about changing the game 
 (After crying all night long) From the state it's in 
 Yeah, about that same old song 
 Wondering will these niggas stop making that same old song? 
 (Laughing and talking) While listening to +Richard+ speak through comedy 
 But obviously painting a bigger picture for these +Pryor+ folks 
 (Like there ain't nothin' wrong) 'Cause it's not and that's a fact folks 
 I promised my momma that I'm gonna take it back folks 
 ('Cause if I ever) Have a chance to make a change I will 
 And I ain't layin down my soul for gold or any form of bills, forget it 
 I'm in this business to strip it of all its limits and live it 
 So all is finished on a road called its limits 
 (But it's easy you see) 
 (Hear don't you hear) 
 (No don't go) 
 (And baby please make that man come back to me)
