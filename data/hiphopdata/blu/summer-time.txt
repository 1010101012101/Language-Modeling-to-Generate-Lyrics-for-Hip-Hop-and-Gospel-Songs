Yours truly 
 A cutie with no brains, a booty 
 The Lovebug Starski tape with the dookie 
 I took her to the drive in movies with the toolie 
 Yeah, in case she tried to do me 
 It was hot as July without Julie 
 Just true newbies in the back, twist the loose leaf 
 The system hittin' bitches in Jacuzzi's 
 Said it wouldn't be Cali without the Uzis 
 Yup, Slide through, the ending I'll drive through 
 With the 2 Live Crew 
 The fly chicks I knew she knew me 
 She said I liked you in high school, she blew me 
 I bought her an iced tea with ice cubes 
 Word up 
 We was 'bout to go to work, but we murked to the jam 
 And all the girls threw their shirts up 
 It's summertime 
 Summer, summer, summertime 
 Time to sit back and unwind 
 The dope touch like Magic, static get stuck 
 Cool cat must of spit lead, lyrics is buck 
 Smash through your speaker and get an upgrade 
 Hit the shop fresh cut high top fade 
 Cool water freshness, car painted glaze 
 Hittin' corners 22 inches and no blade 
 Ride dirty, dip through the traffic, stay paid 
 Hit the court AI cross I'm snug in the J's 
 Summer, summer, summertime 
 Time to sit back and unwind 
 We dump the 1's on the block when the sun get hot 
 Hit the beach with the freaks, Chucks with no socks 
 You know the steelo, my people got it locked 
 Pelligrino's for 3 hoes easin' up the block 
 They turn around and see what we peepin at 
 That all natural type of aphrodisiac 
 We leavin' at noon, the drinks was consumed, we all buzzed 
 But back then we ain't really know what it was 
 Summertime 
 Summer, summer, summertime 
 Time to sit back and unwind 
 Finger roll on bosses 
 Self made and well connected brothers 
 Cuttin' butters lavish livin' base wonder 
 Count skins like a deer hunter 
 You know how we do 
 Many dishes and bottles for my people 
 It's illegal how the steez do 
 You know 2 miles an hour so everybody see you 
 Bass bang out automatic buzz like that 
 Good, good five techin' with the walkin' fuzz 
 Summer, summer, summertime 
 Time to sit back and unwind
