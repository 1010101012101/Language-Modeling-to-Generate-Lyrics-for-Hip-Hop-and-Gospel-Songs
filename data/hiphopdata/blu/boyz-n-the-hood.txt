I was in love with the block, call it the avenue Jones 
 Through the village we just happened to roam 
 Knuckleheads, bad to the bone 
 And every single snotnose had an addict at home 
 I drunk Vodka and juice with the fatherless youth 
 Everyday in between the hours of two we ate taco's and hoot 
 Every now and then somebody would shoot 
 They hit that younging with a stray while he was tying his shoe 
 Let if off then they hopped in the coupe 
 And nobody said a word about the body on the curb 
 Hit the homie Flacko, that's the vato with the herb 
 I mean he probably cool, but his posse full of herbs 
 Got a Chronic from the 'burbs 
 Around the same time I was trying to learn 
 How to pick a lock with a hanger, load shots in the chamber 
 Get loaf from the cops and the neighbors 
 Boys in the hood 
 Born and raised in killa Cali, dreaming one day the city's ours 
 Young niggas hopping fences looking chilly [?] 
 (?) 
 Young kids wearing Nike's sharing bikes, tearing mics up 
 Kept a nice cut in the fades 
 Never affiliated, but my niggas bang getting paid 
 Shouts to my grandma, still in the J's 
 Coco ave. fo-fo mag tucked away when the po-po's pass 
 Walked to the stove, but don't step on the old folk grass 
 A 80's baby like thrifty's and [?] 
 Wear the wrong colors might as well dig your grave 
 Ditch your school to throw hands, stick and move 
 Bagging chicks at five tails like shit was cool 
 Dipping dudes, go by a set of different rules 
 We obviously ain't got shit to lose, boys in the hood 
 I got the old 3 sitting on my neck for my set 
 Big B sitting on my chest for the best 
 Headed to the East, raised in the West 
 In them streets I think you need a cage and a vest 
 Ducking strays on my way to church, on my way to work 
 Blazed trying to lace a verse so I can pay the first 
 Blu be copping chains, shopping days till my pockets hurt 
 Rob a purse if she see me in a soggy shirt 
 But on the turf niggas flipping work, chickens chirp 
 On a flirt, nonsense, no smirk, jerkface, tell the jerk 
 Burgers in a shank 
 If she think she worth what she work she need a break 
 Pissing off the city with a silly cigarette on my BMX 
 With my Rollie on and my Holy text 
 Telling Moses 
 you can lead us through the sea 
 But you can't keep seas out the streets 
 Boys in the hood 
 After school niggas eating Cheeto's by the tether-ball 
 Tony Starks had me fiending for them leather clarks 
 5-0-1's, I'm [?] 
 Niggas going chesting, we watched Darwin duck 
 Bad niggas rocking duck tails, thermos with the lunch pail 
 Taking trips to Cadeline and niggas swear we upscale 
 Puff ails, OE cans and Mickey 
 Real Venice before they're turning shit to [?] 
 That pass is in me skating through that 818 
 Homies out the pen like Ray Lewis gaining weight 
 It ain't for play 
 Thought you know them boys that banging the whole hood 
 Shook, just soft of [?] 
 [?] Domino, my uncle bumped the Commodores 
 Humping on the sub and just be done before their mama home 
 Reminiscing with these poisonous goods 
 Dopeboy, get that dope, boy, boys in the hood 
 Lost in promiseland milking honey's 
 Feel the dreams, this the city of angel 
 Set your neck on the line, that shit'll get strangled 
 What you expect? Besides connected, the culdesac counsil 
 Starterjacks [?] and it sort of pass 
 Fresh from court, no ward in pass 
 Pour more with a taller glass 
 Monetary support towards some college class 
 A wealth of knowledge, hustle mania 
 Game became placed to make power 
 Sitting on the stoop like a substitute, solid 
 Chopping it with the barbers [?] 
 Sipping a chalice in childish comfort 
 The colors got colored improper 
 Shuffling shuckers, cool suckers, cards for audit
