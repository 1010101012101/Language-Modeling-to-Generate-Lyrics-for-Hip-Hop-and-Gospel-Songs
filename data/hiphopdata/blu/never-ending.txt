It just does not stop ... it never ends 
 Like a precious blend of life wrapped into heaven's winds 
 Like sex and infinite with every second and minute 
 Sending love for what's missing, killing the stress and the sinning 
 Then it begins ... you meet her 
 And the first eternal cycle of life starts to occur, first your vision is blurred 
 Try'na figure how to get her peeps jockin so you're eavesdroppin' listenin' to her words 
 First time, love at first sight, it's relevant in your life 
 A glow like an angel on earth, her soul was so bright 
 That your nights become days 
 One way or the other she'll discover your praise 
 And someday you'll be lovers, that's just to say the least 
 And if you ever get the guts to speak 
 Nothing but a couple feet away from making love complete 
 But you love the discreet thoughts that cross in your mind and that's it 
 Like an isolated island in the sunshine is that chick 
 Next day the same shit, same time, same impression you get 
 Same kind of feeling killing your mind 'cause you're too shy to say shit 
 Not even "Hi", wishin' a perceptional state 
 So you visit this same place envisioning the chick as a fix for this 
 Silent as a predator the prey you stay picturin' 
 Your souls walk across the ocean both talkin' of emotions 
 Till your hearts' caught in the moment of an omen called love 
 Supposed to last forever 
 Awakened by a waiter askin' if you have his cheddar 
 And you realize 
 Nothing can be better than havin' the pleasure sitting at the table that she's gigglin at 
 But never will you ever get at that ... so you smile 
 While the world continues and thoughts send you to the clouds 
 Where Flora Purim sings of dream and you absorb 
 The never ending feeling that you're living for nothing more than her
