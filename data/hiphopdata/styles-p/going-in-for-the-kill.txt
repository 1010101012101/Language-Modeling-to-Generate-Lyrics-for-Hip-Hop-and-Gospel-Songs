(La Roux - Sample) 
 I'm going in for the kill 
 I'm doing it for a thrill 
 Oh I'm hoping you'll understand 
 And not let go of my hand 
 (x2) 
 Styles P: 
 This is for Hoods everywhere 
 I'm Back 
 We ain't come here for the chit chat but shit got a hell of a kickback 
 And I don't give a fuck so your face like a dutch imma go head and split that 
 Niggas in the top 5 fuck is the list at, errbody die where they poppin' the cryst at 
 Gun in ya mouth brain on your wall ya tryin' get louder than I 
 Go head and smoke I'm responsible for clouds in the sky 
 And you couldn't find niggas to swallow or naht 
 The hoopdie same color as shit nigga 
 Run up and hit niggas god bless whoever you wit nigga 
 Sombody gunna break down and cry 
 When they look at your face how the four bullets break down ya eye 
 I'm from a place where ya either kicked out or die 
 Shit real when they catch you at the wheel and blow your face out the ride 
 Styles P: 
 If you forgot my name or my style I'm the ghost with the hornet flow and corner style with a piece of shit car 
 With two 45's bout to rob everything I'll be gone a while 
 They ain't let you know I'm a grimball whenever the time pause and I find y'all I'm taking ya spine off 
 Let's be serious dead serious if you with cops how you letting your 9 off 
 Jadakiss: 
 Yo you got a hole in you you bleeding so it's not like I'm just calling you pussy for no reason 
 Me I'm a bastard I hit the blunts till I gotta cough then I pass em 
 Exhaust on the Ashton 
 That next choice you make might be your last one 
 Shit that I needed stuck with me from the classroom 
 Real talk now who's the king of New York now 
 Boys got safe's in the house I got a vault now 
 Yeaaaaaaaaaa 
 Jadakiss: 
 Just mad you never be as nice as I am 
 Put my life on it 
 Soon as you sit in hot water all you gotta do is put the ice on it 
 I've been giving it to niggas for years 
 Fans still getting wireless head that's with no hands 
 Listen my grandmas composition compared to ya'lls is way beyond exsistance 
 D-Block daddy new black caddie come through knocking michael mcdonald and pattie 
 P's and haze is still going for 8 and a nattie 
 Rather have God arrest me than Satan and bag me 
 Get serious I'll gladly involve ya moms 
 Al quada J I'm only involved with bombs 
 Put my life on it 
 Soon as you sit in hot water all you gotta do is put the ice on it 
 I've been giving it to niggas for years 
 I'm responsible for niggas careers 
 Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaa
