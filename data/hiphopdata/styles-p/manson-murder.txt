Believe me, if I started murdering people... 
 There'd be none of you left. 
 Basically, hit you with the hard nigga recipe 
 Fuck you! If you ain't with me, you're next to me 
 (Fuck you!) 
 I ain't one for the small talk 
 Goes to get it in it like Nucky on Boardwalk 
 Real grinding nigga though, I'mma let the 4 talk 
 You ain't got to hear me dog, you could hear the lower talk 
 Uzzi at the place when the Shawty blow the doors off 
 Free my dollar bills and killin' niggas that they kid me 
 Nothing on yo bitch face, rain is in the sick place 
 Maybe it's the wax or the fact that I'm shit phased 
 Rap spelled backwards is par - you ain't up to that 
 If your shit sound whack I had enough of that 
 Fuck 'em all from the bottom to the top 
 If you left it up to me, yeah all of 'em be shot 
 A bullseye on the forehead 
 Why do you wanna call me a murderer for? 
 I've never killed anyone 
 I don't need to kill anyone 
 I think it 
 Voices in the attic, bodies in the basement 
 People under the stairs hold my guns and chasin 
 When I buy a brick I bring the best set to taste it 
 Zombies out here, yeah this shit is like a wasteland 
 I don't give a fuck about no goddamn bath salts 
 P91 to blow half of your mass off 
 Face all over the asphalt 
 No track down here but whips is like NASCAR 
 Weed in the glass jar, shot 'em in the head 'cause the trash words 
 Then I got ghosts like Casper 
 No, I get ghosts like myself 
 If I rap like you I put the toast to myself 
 I shit on you, the mic booth in your board 
 Why don't you find a bridge and bungee with no chord 
 Or build yourself a pool full of swords 
 Dive in it, next time you rhyme put your mind in it 
 Maybe I should've killed 4 to 500 people, 
 Then I would've felt better 
 The healthiest nigga in New York, smoking Newport's 
 I'm not a new boos, I'm in the new Porsche 
 My Nike sneakers, it be my like sneakers 
 Jogging on the beach with my wife beaters 
 Word to Obama mama, Jeffrey Dammer drama 
 Swiss got keys, pianos and Alicia 
 When I be talkin' keys I'm talkin' coke and the Keisha 
 I know chicks that swallow cum and they still suck it 
 Miscarriage hoes, fowl 'cause they still fuckin' 
 You know the deal, they don't even wait to heal 
 My booster bitches - they can't even wait to steal 
 My favorite sex position is the 69 
 I fuck er at 6 while holdin' my 9 
 Amsterdam, stuff blunts, call 'em sumos 
 Walkin' out the walk, with a veggie meal you know 
 Kick yo feet up like weed up, show yo speeder 
 I'm the king, man 
 I run the underworld, guy 
 I make the money, man 
 I change minds.
