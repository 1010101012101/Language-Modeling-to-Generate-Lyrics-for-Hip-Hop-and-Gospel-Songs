Play no more around this town 
 Play no more around this town 
 'Cause I am gonna shoot you down 
 Half asleep, half up 
 Mad house, leaning on the fast buck 
 You know me that's if I got my mask up 
 I'm mad cool like the AC on max 
 Show money on weed and the clothes out of sacks 
 No soil in the jungle so we rose from the cracks 
 Of the sidewalk, why you think we specialized in ply talk? 
 From the dark side of the force, I'm not the Skywalker 
 Know I named a pizza shop but nigga get the paws off 
 Remember misery loves company 
 Yo homies got yo back but ask yo self, who's frontin me? 
 How much is the work worth? 
 How much getting murk worth? 
 Sometimes I get high and I wonder if church works 
 As I changed the first verse and the kirk first 
 Gonna ask myself - yo, how much is the verse worth? 
 I know it's priceless but I still gotta charge a price 
 Shit is static, go back to the heart of life 
 Masked like Bane, Dark Knight like Wayne 
 Gangstas with night skills is missing from the game 
 Stand up G, I strive for my son 
 But the cold ass streets forced me to crater with my guns 
 Ones is the only thing that matters 
 I try to keep it real 
 They just here about swagger 
 King of New York shit, meet me at the Plaza 
 You can talk shit and get pluck with the dagger 
 I'm on it, on one, up one 
 Probly on the dolo with the Top Gun 
 Shout to polo niggas with the dutch done 
 Trinnies on the bamboo, jeps on the raw booze 
 New to the jail niggas that never wanna go home 
 You should do the science 
 If you don't know math then build your alliance 
 But will yo man stand in the pan when you fry him? 
 All of us is living but all of us is dying 
 Getting money or you trying 
 Blow up OZ, meditate and levitate 
 The time is money nigga so we never wait 
 We got shit to do, kill you all for principle 
 Cool and I ain't listen 'cause I thought I was the principle 
 Custom kidding on the European 
 You see me, I blow the weed and then I look Korean 
 But I ain't from Korea though 
 Life's a bitch, money gon burn like gonorrhea though 
 It's all truth or it's all lies 
 Need a bionic man on a full guy 
 I'm major like Lee Majors 
 Cop money for crack as a teenager
