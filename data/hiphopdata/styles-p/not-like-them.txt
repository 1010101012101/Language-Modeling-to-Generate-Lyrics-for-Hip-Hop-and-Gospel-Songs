I could be parallel to bad as hell 
 Equivalent to ignorant 
 Depends on the matter, well, if it's that insignificant 
 I'll just have to tell a nigga to kick rocks with flip flops 
 Rappers rather tell than sit in a cell to snitch hop 
 I ain't paying to disc jock, he ain't getting the wrist-watch 
 I'm the realest to make it, he takin' dick in the shit box 
 I kinda get why I'm legit, mostly to the folks who think dominant 
 I see why dishonest shit is so prominent 
 See the kids that rhymin' it, that ain't lived not a line of it 
 You ain't hood money not good money ya counterfeit 
 The kind of a jan, I get on some lo-lo for lanna shit 
 Name a state now fivin' it, with that coke in them llamas, bitch 
 Hold up, what time is it? The clock strike ten 
 I guarantee none of y'all be on the block like him 
 Cock the fifth back you get baffled, click clack, you skipped that 
 Lot of niggas bust they guns, but not like them 
 The record labels are scared of me, internet gotta bag me 
 First they said I was gangsta, then they said 'not exactly' 
 I rap about politicians, rap about protect 
 They losin' the manuevers that Edgar Hoover reenacted 
 Being on my black shit, they be tryna silence me 
 But to do that shit, they have to do it violently 
 Clack clack that act back 
 Rat-at-at that backjack 
 A lot of niggas bust they guns, but not like them 
 A lot of niggas bust they guns, but not like them 
 Y'all niggas is luke-warm, y'all ain't hot like them 
 Them motherfuckers my brothers, they ain't my friends 
 We the band with the bond, from grams on the arm 
 A lot of niggas bust they guns, but not like them 
 Y'all niggas is luke-warm, y'all ain't hot like them 
 Them motherfuckers my brothers, they ain't my friends 
 We the band with the bond, from grams on the arm 
 The uncut dope, ya had to land on a farm 
 Rapping on arenas, rubberbands to the mobs 
 Getting high to Sinatra, in the sands of the palms 
 Reminiscing my rapping with BIG, the man with the don 
 Niggas did it big, but not like them 
 Drink champange in the ocean just to drown my sins 
 Should have (?) a valet, roll around my Benz 
 These niggas know my beginning, but not my end 
 It's me and Saigon in the pizons 
 Never behind us like we vary our zones 
 Go ahead and chill out, get your vibe on 
 Cause this could be the day that you died on
