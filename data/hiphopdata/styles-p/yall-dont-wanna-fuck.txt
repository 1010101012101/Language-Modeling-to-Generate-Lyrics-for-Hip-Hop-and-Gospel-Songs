My Style's louder than a stereo 
 Fouler than the snake when I kill these fuckin' rappers 
 Then show up at the burials 
 I don't mean to worry y'all but I want y'all gone 
 And this M-16 is the only way to hurry y'all 
 Here's my last proposition, I'm treatin' rap like crack 
 If I don't sell the most, I gotta kill the competition 
 Don't take it personal, gotta go to jail and if I come back 
 And don't have my cash, then I'm hurtin' you 
 Got a business gun wit industry bullets 
 When it hit you, motherfucker, guaranteed it be jerkin' you 
 Rings is so my contact will break up your man 
 I'm a gentleman, my contract's a shake of a hand 
 I make it hard so, only God could wake up your man 
 'Cause I do things the Don way 
 It's Paniro the Ghost, Goodfella like fucking Jim Conway 
 Leave no evidence 
 Fuck a dead man, when I can leave off the scene wit dead presidents 
 What? Motherfucker, yeah 
 Don't you ever try to fuck wit M.O.P. and Styles 
 This is for the hood and niggas that's wild 
 If you 'bout to die or you blowin' the trial 
 We're gangsta ass niggas that been flowin' awhile 
 Ayo, let's do it for the hood where there's alotta homicides at 
 Where killers ride at and O.G.s reside at 
 It's rugged, son, I love it, son, I see it every day 
 Fuck that, we'll find another way to play 
 So don't mistake me for no rap artist 
 Missin' old dude is from the old school 
 He abide by the old rules 
 And our Pro-Tools is 38 longs 
 The crime rate will inflate and the murder rate is strong 
 How could we get along? 
 And you doing this underhanded fagot shit, you fagot bitch 
 We gotta get you gone, William Danze songs 
 (Chapter one) 
 All disloyal guys should be shot in they back 
 Once and left paralyzed 
 (Game over now) 
 You gon' change me, how? 
 What you thought would happen 
 When they chained me to Fame and Styles 
 You ask in the hood about it, all it can be is 
 L M O O X P, motherfucker 
 You keep thinkin' when I flow Pa, it's a wrap 
 Put when your ass, get beat wit a crowbar, it's a wrap 
 For real, we straight thug it 
 Read my palms, you see more chapters than L. Ron Hubbard 
 Huh, we done dealt more drugs than Genovese 
 Made dope fiends outta school principals and deans 
 Now they all fucked up, career finished 
 Got they ass noddin' in front of the Methodon clinics 
 We thug it all day but it ain't the Henny in me 
 It's that Brownsville shit wit a splash of Trinny in me 
 All I need is a hammer and a clip load 
 I'll stomp, do whatever, state, borough, zip code 
 It's the M.O.P., mashin' through your ghetto 
 Rippin heavy metal, wit Paniro 
 (We Ruff Ryde) 
 Listen up, y'all better respect the criminal shit of these O.G.s 
 What's poppin', nigga? 
 Don't you ever try to fuck wit M.O.P. and Styles 
 This is for the hood and niggas that's wild 
 If you 'bout to die or you blowin' the trial 
 We're gangsta ass niggas that been flowin' awhile 
 We can beef, I don't give a fuck 
 'Cause if you kill me, I got niggas that'll bend up your son 
 It's the world's most gutterest 
 Paniro the Ghost, they thought of me when they invented the gun 
 To tell the truth, I prefer the knife 
 'Cause he physical nigga 
 I go in your chest, I show you how to murder right 
 It's deep, I'ma kill your mother and I don't care if I die 
 'Cause all that mean is that I gonna join my little brother 
 Dog, I had a hard life and I'm in love with the pain 
 Thug in the game wit heroin and hard white 
 Back to the guns, the way I squeeze off threes off 
 Leave a hole in your stomach, take a nigga knees off 
 Face gets splattered around, too many cops for the glock 
 Fuck it, dog, then I'm battin' you down 
 Don't you ask me what's happenin' now 
 This ain't a re-run, niggas. see P gun 
 I'm clappin' you clowns, what? 
 You don't wanna touch this 
 It's Paniro the Ghost, Goodfella like fucking Jim Conway 
 You don't wanna touch this 
 It's Lil Fizzy wit that Brownsville shit 
 And splash of Trinny in me 
 You don't wanna touch this 
 Bill, 38 long, the crime rate will inflate 
 And the murder rate is strong 
 You don't wanna touch this
