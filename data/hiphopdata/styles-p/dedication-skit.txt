I like to dedicate this mother fucking album, 
 To my brother, 
 Who's gone but he still here with me, 
 No matter where you at we always together, 
 No matter where I'm at we always together, 
 And, besides that I would like to dedicate to my mother fucking niggaz, 
 And everbody in tha grind, 
 Streets and the struggle, 
 My nigga D lets keep it going, 
 Gary Field wet it down my niggaz, 
 See you when I get there, 
 Lets just mother fucking keep it going, 
 Everybody, 
 Feel the Ghost (Echo)
