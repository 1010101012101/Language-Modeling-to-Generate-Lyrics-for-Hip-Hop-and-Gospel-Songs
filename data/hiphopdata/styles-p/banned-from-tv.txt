Banned from TV 
 N.o.r.e 
 Moving 
 Shut the fuck up 
 Ay Yo Ay yo Regardless of rain or snow sleet or hail 
 I kick street tales choking niggas like I'm sprewell 
 Golden state holding your fate in the palm of my hand 
 Blow you away like its part of the plan 
 I gotta call it like I see it talk it like I be it 
 Walkin' my walk thugged out orthopedic 
 'Cause I'm soon to be up, give me room watch me heat up 
 Niggas try to stick me like abdul lerima, follow the leader 
 Make me go extra hard, yo nore should I hold back or show the repirtore 
 Quit at 16 or throw in extra bars just for the non-believers 
 I show them why it's so hard to reach us 
 I get pussy with my fathers features 
 Puff heavenly, see me at 6'1" weigh a buck 70 
 Catch me in spots y'all niggas never be 
 Packed in like green bay 
 Harlem week to queens day 
 Performing acapella, no DJ 
 98 live, no replays 
 Make it seem easy, so tell a friend to tell a friend 
 That its them again, nature noreaga, wild gremlins 
 Yo, yo, champagne on the rocks 
 Pour on the fort knox lazura 
 Shark salad with cabbage 
 Pork chops and applesauce 
 Twin connection, disrespect watch your body cave in 
 Pump the shotty guagin, hit the shorty while he potty training 
 I ain't playing, I'm truly the worst 
 Simply the first to get his whole body fully reversed 
 Uzi it hurts, leave you double-dead 
 I'ma a bubble-head, I never listen to nothing my mother said 
 Ay yo I hold niggas ransom for money 
 Like Johnny handsome 
 Been sonning niggas for so long 
 I think I got a grandson 
 My passion is money, a stash and a honey 
 That won't ask questions but will blast anybody 
 That's my kind of girl, kinda of world I want to live in 
 Not a cell or a prison or in hell's armageddon 
 Just a little ghetto 
 Where my niggas control the middle 
 We know the riddles of life where others know only a little 
 Yo, yo been in rich places, sick places 
 Seen my story on six thousand six hundred and sixty six pages 
 Wages, I wrote six aces 
 And at the same dice games, I caught six cases 
 All over big faces, now it's tipped laces 
 Ready to dig faces, but the bang it ain't 
 Bitch spaces, niggas loading up they rib cages 
 Cats like to rip places 
 Bloody lip tastes, but the Cam is in big races? 
 But I stay in import the pig places 
 But the world know the girl though 
 I fuck her off a furlough 
 She'll be up, hook me up 
 All your sales could be luck 
 Only question for these ducks is 
 Baby girl can we fuck 
 You the type that need a wife 
 Thought L-o-x told y'all the key to life 
 Asshole, yo I don't play around 
 I lay it down 
 Fuck around, I spray around 
 Flick a biscuit, nigga risk it 
 My ass, you can kick or kiss it 
 Ain't no niggas in the world more thorough than this 
 (Bust off) and sit the hot barrel dead on your lips 
 Like 2 thirds of a brick (penaro and kiss) 
 And kiss the crystal white fluffy part in the back of a whip 
 See the plan is to stash all, and cash y'all 
 The weed so strong, they gotta put it glass jars 
 Niggas try to smoke me out, mope me out 
 'Cause the rims on my new joint be poking out 
 I'm about to have no feelings 
 Shit is deep, do they dance with the devil when they sleep 
 I wake up gripping the air, wishing the hit 
 Shit that they kick in ya ear 
 When your soul be drifting in air 
 My gift is half-rotten when I spit it tears 
 That shit'll drop down my eye, I'm too tired to cry 
 And I ain't never seen a nigga that too live to die 
 They say you get what you ask for, so get it 'cause you asked for it 
 If a nigga ain't a thief, then he better have the cash for it 
 And we gonna be around till ya body rott 
 And if the feds bring us in we get the same time gotti got 
 What!what! what! what! 
 Yo, yo! ay yo, there's two ways into the hood, one plain 
 The other smoke chronic like straight to the brain 
 Ay yo let's get loose, Hennesey straight, with tomato juice 
 Queens stallion, my guns, fully Italian 
 Now y'all niggas recognize medallions 
 I play the best hood, o-t with Tim Westwood 
 Used to be on section 8, now my section is good 
 Thugged out niggas, we eat as much as we could 
 And I don't give a fuck what! yo I save my shit 
 And I don't give a fuck what! you can save your shit 
 Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick 
 Listen to Bob Marley, you funny niggas like Steve Harvey 
 Frontin' live with a weak army 
 I play the nice guy too, I'll smoke with you 
 But the realness, I ain't got no love for you 
 That's why I never do a song with you 
 Not even if your babies mom fucked the crew 
 And promised to give us head and swallow too 
 I still say no, no is no, no can doe 
 Ya niggas drinking henneray, drinking my flow 
 Yo, thug shit thug shit what what 
 What the fuck is the deal 
 Thugged out entertainment 
 Untertainment 
 L-o-x 
 Terror squad 
 This shit is fucking official
