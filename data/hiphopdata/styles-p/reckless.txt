I'm accustomed to getting fast dough 
 It takes that whole work by they asshole 
 Standing by the pool in a bath robe 
 Bullet in yo C's or your afro 
 Lookin' at the don and the Eiffel 
 Be the biggest prize if real niggas was rappin' 
 You baffled, throw you off the scaffel 
 Gon hit with the scalpel like the doctor 
 Rap style proper and I'm a gun popper 
 West side highway flyin coke chopper 
 Only fuck with niggas that prosper 
 Bitch ass niggas love to gossip 
 Getting high fully, get Kennedy 
 Get yo ass turned to a memory 
 Remember he, remember him 
 Played me nigga, you'll never win 
 Reckless 
 Reckless 
 Reckless 
 All soofoo, all loco 
 You don't owe me nothing but real rap 
 Under the laundry bag is still wap 
 Shoot first, not from sideways, niggas is young boys 
 Ringers is OJ's, blow crazy 
 Under the building, Poltergeist in it 
 Sucked in the low best with ice in it 
 Buy cars, runnin' through Mars, snatch yo jewels and dip dodge 
 And don't make me whip, it's sergeant now 
 It's drop in the 718 
 Roll out, eleven niggas, snitches gon hate 
 We're strapped to the max, hit the light as the indoor cyphers 
 Do anything to kill more Nikes up 
 Growling with the wolves and the world riches 
 Mostly y'all niggas' hoes is real bitches 
 Catch you in the flicks, know the game 456 
 We brought the cocaine with the quick 
 We in the same game but it's different innards 
 Yeah it's polo but it's different in it 
 Got a gun but never been on a mission with it 
 Seen crack but never been in the kitchen with it 
 Never caught a nigga slippin' with it 
 You just rappin' like a criminal 
 I'm a criminal rappin', a five star general 
 Fuck fake niggas, the message ain't subliminal 
 Better take yo vitamins and minerals 
 You talk a lot and the bullets when I'm the interview 
 So wutchu say now? 
 Free shit, got bullets to give away now 
 Free shit, you get down or lay down 
 But once you laid down you stay down 
 'Cause that's two to the dome piece 
 Bullets in the air like the phone piece
