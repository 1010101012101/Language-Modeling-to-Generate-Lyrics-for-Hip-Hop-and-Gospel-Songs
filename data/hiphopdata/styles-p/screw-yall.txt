Hatin' niggas thinkin' the air of me 
 Motherfuckers is not scarin me 
 Nigga you're not hearing me 
 Nigga you never heard of me 
 Who'd be the first cocksucker that want to murder me? 
 Whip engineer down in Germany 
 Outside scene but the inside's Burgundy 
 Life ain't promised but nigga death is a certainty 
 Bubbling and struggling, yeah like the purp with me 
 And get faded, no head but 
 Elevators broke them niggas and take the stairs up 
 I'm real, you ain't nigga so don't sompare us 
 You the type of nigga I tears up 
 Just like a tissue 
 So killing you ain't issue 
 Get stripes in the whistle and you still ain't official 
 So screw y'all, I never knew y'all 
 You clickin like yellow lights, I'm runnin' through y'all 
 Screw y'all, I never knew y'all 
 Y'all pimpin' at the end of the phase, I'm runnin' through y'all 
 Dance with the devil, I bet you you'll pay the price 
 Couple niggas die and a couple will get life 
 Couple niggas change when they get to see the light 
 Couple get a second chance and do the same shit twice 
 Doing wrong shit but I can do it right 
 That's the life, you don't know what I could welcome you tonight 
 Get a light, sit back, nigga welcome to the flights 
 When the cheese fly high, these ride by and you try to bring 'em love 
 Me, I'm getting sick of dope rhyming, Singapore 
 You don't like that? Nigga middle finger though 
 These niggas won't match but I bet you they clingers do 
 Yap to yo face but the battle swingin' low 
 These first teeth next, you don't want beef yet 
 Getting money nigga so I don't make cheap threats 
 The tray pound is the big three and you ain't see the heat yet 
 They say half the world sick in the brain 
 Takin' flicks of a man getting hit by a train 
 No way, too many people that are rich will complain 
 While the homeless sing in the rain, living off change 
 Other countries claim that heroes suicidal 
 Over here it's strange, fake killas become idols 
 Don't believe in gangsta? Let's swear on the bible 
 Keep the enemy close, now yo best friend yo rival 
 Tryna be honest in a land full of crooks 
 When they'll read your rights and they'll hand you the book 
 Mom cryin up in court while you can't even look 
 Can't compare to the bombs or the kids that stand me up 
 Who's written and I wanna rollie 
 This is the rap race, now we all nothing but rollies 
 Tryna find the snakes of the grass, I gotta smoke it 
 Now lookin' for the driver but still waitin for my moment 
 Stop fooling with these folks who haven't been through anything 
 You are not going to get a flaw from people who have not been crushed 
 The real flow of glory will always come from somebody who's been crushed 
 There will be a flow from out of him like you have never seen before 
 It's beyond anything you have ever seen before 
 Somebody shout, let it flow
