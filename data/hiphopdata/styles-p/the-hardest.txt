Big Producer: 
 Yeah It's the ghost SP 
 Wit the G-O-D AZ 
 It's the ghost SP 
 Wit the G-O-D AZ 
 Hardest yeah hardest out 
 Styles P: 
 I'm from a part of new york that's fowler than poor 
 Where the dirty niggas pile in the court (shit) 
 You should know I'm a yonkers native 
 Gem star swing somebody cut your run wit david 
 Stomp ya head like its part of the pavement 
 Got business to engage in, my man got a case 
 And we got to go kill a witness just to save him 
 Always got me back on that new shit 
 Playing marvin gaye right before and after I do shit 
 Fucking wit them niggas that's ruthless 
 Havoc niggas in the bar rx-7 and supra's 
 Drinking to much smoking to much 
 Going places acting ignorant provoking too much 
 I don't know the nigga fucking had opened him up 
 I'm from a place where the man that hit ya 
 Bounced to orlando wit ya 
 On a roll let the cannon hit ya 
 Boy we oh so fowl 
 And I ain't tryna blow no trail 
 These niggas show no style 
 They like cowards on the stand (cowards) 
 Looking at the nine I got the power in my hand, feel me 
 Maybe not wit your lady shot 
 Why don't you tell me what your baby got, nigga 
 Your playing the game, stick to the rules 
 If you don't know 'em then go back to school motherfucker 
 Chorus (Styles P): 
 I'm T-H-E H-A-R-D-E-S-T you don't wanna see SP 
 Everyday I wake up it's like I'm liabel to sin 
 Smoke haze and bible paper swallowing gin 
 I'm G-H-O-S-T I can crack the ground 
 And make the clouds come down 
 Find me if your looking for trouble 
 Send a 100 niggas imma bust a thousand rounds 
 AZ: 
 I'm the rap James Bond 
 My crack hairs gone 
 Got it cuffed in the court 
 Had my mac face on 
 Funny walk money talk toe black stay calm 
 We up north like a boss that had half his arms 
 Slid his mom 7 grand told her hold that down 
 We fam it go low then I roll back 'round 
 Am as viscous as the realest you know 
 Only difference is consistence I'm considered a pro 
 From the trenches till I'm dead and inches below 
 It's not a game hear the name better snitchin wit dough you never know 
 Niggas wanna see me dead, death threats being spread 
 But its easily said they can't touch me 
 Stay wit a chick and a dutchy 
 Slim and quick but the fifth make me feel like I'm husky 
 Develish don't move with a car lean over 
 Most wanted in the mix tryna dodge that quarter 
 I'm wit tarver and weigh more than that's most 
 I'm wit the ghost and we bang like we champs of the coast 
 Put your gloves on and fuck the humble shit the love is gone 
 By the morning they'll mumble and mourn motherfuckas 
 Chorus (AZ): 
 I'm T-H-E H-A-R-D-E-S-T y'all don't wanna see AZ 
 At any givin' minute nigga liabel to flip 
 You wanna pimp nigga find you a bitch I'm not the one 
 S-O-S that's me got a 100 hungry goons that'll kill for free 
 And the same young nigga that'll torch ya face 
 Suit up and support the waste
