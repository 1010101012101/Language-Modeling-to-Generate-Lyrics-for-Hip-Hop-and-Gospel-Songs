(Feat. 354) 
 Come on man 
 Sp 3 5 4 
 Strugglin my life 
 God damn I reflect on 
 Those I used to hustle with 
 And now we just fly kites 
 Damn we be living some wild lifes 
 We got to get them crackers to right 
 They treat us like wild life 
 Got to pay the bills for the building 
 The precious building the type of shit that make you rob us a billion 
 My whole generation was brainwashed 
 Lookin' at the rims should I get 'em detailed or handwashed 
 A man like his watch and his jersey 
 Try to bring bricks down south and we stopped in new jersey 
 Told them that the game was painful 
 If you don't want to take time to think the bullets are brainful 
 Big when they bang you then angels a change you 
 I ain't trying to game you 'cause I'm in the game to 
 Shit I been struggling for far too long 
 My niggas on the block bubblin' for far too long 
 354 shit 
 Shadow wah folly 
 My pain my thoughts my tears 
 My struggle my life my fears 
 I engraved my name in d streets 
 But you don't know what I go through just to see my kids eat 
 Those ain't pay up in 10 weeks 
 The baby mumma drama all day 'cause I'm breaking home ends meet 
 Past cota with me what the fuck you expect 
 Wonder when this music industry gone cut me a cheque 
 Chad told me look at my beeper I got the connect 
 And even listen to the streets dog I got the respect 
 If I die and go the hard way fuck it I'm a go hard 
 Presense gonna be felt on the streets or in the prison yard 
 Next I invision god right beside me with duck mella speil lotion and lee roy dolby 
 Puck rock incidents dog that shit scarred me 
 Picture me scared to die now nigga that's harvy no 
 Some real shit 
 Ay yo this is my clip my hammer my slugs 
 And I still shed blood for the love of my thugs 
 Still breaking days end while I blaze in the wind 
 The struggle of my life hustlin right and after gym 
 See I'm gifted with this curse 
 You can feel in every verse 
 I'll bring it from the dirt 
 I'm the hell on this earth 
 You can smell what I'm worth 
 If these cheques don't cut 
 Then these tecks gon buck 
 You can tell how it hurt 
 See my niggas need work 
 My dog just got 25 and he need church 
 And he seen worse 
 When you try to take my pride and leave me stuffed with the pain 
 Left my only stride nothing to lose only the game 
 When I bang for the suffering 400 years 
 We had enough of it 
 It's etched in our veins we still thuggin' it 
 If I had to do it again I thug it twice 
 Take a slice of the struggle in my life, one
