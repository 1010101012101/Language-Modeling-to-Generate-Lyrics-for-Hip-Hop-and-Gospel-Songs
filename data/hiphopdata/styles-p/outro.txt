Yeah my niggaz, just spend a little bit of time with the ghost 
 Holiday, styles, pinero, well you listen to me 
 Real niggaz feel me, some real nggaz probably won't feel me 
 But as you know me, I don't really give a fuck 
 Before I leave I'd like to give a word to the shorties 
 Despite what I say, despite what you see in the streets 
 Dspite what you influenced by, the life of crime has many downs 
 A little bit of ups, and everything you do got consequences and repercussions, 
 So you're best bet better be to stay in school 
 Hit the books, stay off the streets if possble 
 To those on the streets, who feel stuck in the game 
 To those in jail, that's just how shit goes sometimes 
 We make do wit what we got. 
 To all MC's, poets, lyricists, people such as myself, ghostly individuals 
 You should listen to my album, and listen and listen and listen 
 I don't know what I'ma sell or none or that shit 
 I would say I don't give a fuck but I'd probably be lying 
 I love to get money and break it down wit my niggaz 
 But in case I don't, the most important thing is respect and honor 
 And I got plenty of that, so until sheek lou child, next l.o.x. album 
 And all the mtherfucking rest of the albums we do from the double R 
 To the d block, to anybody else whose our motherfucking family putting down an 
 Album, we gon crush y'all motherfuckers 
 Well this one is the ghost, my lil niggaz stay outta trouble, 
 My big niggaz who in trouble, hold ya head and everybody in the motherfucking 
 Struggle, I love you and if you love me, 
 Shit I'll see you when I get there, One.
