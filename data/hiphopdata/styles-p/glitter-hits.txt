(First Part) 
 Mama said, 
 Be nice with cops and policemen, 
 Be nice with all those kids you hate, 
 Your life is not too complicate. 
 (That's Right!) 
 You and my guitar too, 
 There's nothing to do, 
 I wouldn't dare to kiss you, sorry, 
 I just use pick up lines, 
 I'm almost divine, 
 I never had a look such scary, 
 Tough decision, 
 Tough decision, 
 Tough decision, 
 Tough decision, 
 There's a tough decision, 
 Tough decision. 
 Yeah they made you want to live in hell, 
 They made you want to hate your head, 
 They want to see you suffocate, 
 And it's a tough decision 
 Tough decision, 
 Tough decision, 
 Tough decision, 
 There's a tough decision, 
 Tough decision, 
 There's a tough decision, 
 Tough decision. 
 (Second Part) 
 Frankenstein, 
 Around with someone else's mind, 
 He moves and talks just like a tree, 
 Don't you think he's just like me? 
 Flow, as I never go, 
 Why can't you be low? 
 I won't jump if I see blurry, 
 Now away from the crowd, 
 The music gets loud, 
 I just wanna kiss you birdie, 
 Tough decision, 
 Tough decision, 
 Tough decision, 
 Tough decision, 
 There's a tough decision, 
 Tough decision. 
 (Chorus Again)
