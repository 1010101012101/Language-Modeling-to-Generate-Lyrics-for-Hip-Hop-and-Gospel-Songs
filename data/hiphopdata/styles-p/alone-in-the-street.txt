I don't really care, what I sell or what I sold 
 As long as I give my soul, whenever my story told 
 I don't know how you roll but I roll all alone 
 In a zone knowin' **** well, my little brother home 
 Still feel him in the passenger seat 
 I can't see him and I wish that he could chatter with me 
 In due time until then you would see I got more than a few rhymes 
 Thought I'd be there to see him like more than a few times 
 Tryin' to stay away from beef but **** is gettin' deep 
 My restin' right, it's like I'm on lay away from sleep 
 I think I should have been an author or somethin' 
 Disappear like hoofer or somethin' 
 Come back when they offer me somethin' 
 My word eye gotta a little crust in my third eye 
 Headaches is why I've been meditating, thoughts is devastating 
 Could this be my last life, maybe my past life 
 Is the future when I'm asleep? So what was last night? 
 I'm going in deep and you know the ghost 
 Alone in the street 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 o'clock in the morning 
 You know I'm trying to see more 
 Alone in the street 
 All day, all night, all by myself 
 You know that I'm all right 
 Alone in the street 
 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 p.m. 
 You know I trying to get it in 
 Alone in the street 
 All day, all night 
 Mad live could learn to bounce out on a bad vibe 
 Or even keep a gun in your cab ride 
 Have I ever thought about my life as a bad guy? 
 Made a little money sellin' rocks that was cap sized 
 Robbed a lot of people like I never was baptized 
 Yeah, I was a very young teen when I took my **** hotter 
 But got right off my dean when I could book the ramatta 
 'Cause I rather be a robber or a midnight morata 
 There's a part of me that loves bein' gangsta 
 All of me, I couldn't help but get in the game 
 The **** was callin' me and I think that I was callin' it back 
 But you can't help but trip when you fall in a trap 
 If the lord call who got the phone for callin' him back? 
 These are man made, why don'tcha tell man to do that? 
 But he can't so I'm a stay on a spiritual flap 
 'Cause it's a up hill battle and I'm dealin' with that 
 Alone in the street 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 o'clock in the morning 
 You know I'm trying to see more 
 Alone in the street 
 All day, all night, all by myself 
 You know that I'm all right 
 Alone in the street 
 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 p.m. 
 You know I trying to get it in 
 Alone in the street 
 All day, all night 
 Consider this the sermon, start the burnin' 
 Never said you was hard, I ain't give you the permit 
 I might think your vermette, better yet vomit 
 Alone in the streets with the gun by the armpit 
 Can't put the sharks with the pine fish, that's conflict 
 Sorta like mixin', boy scouts with the convicts 
 Somebody go and pay if somebody gonna play 
 'Cause the streets cold hearted than a hot summer day 
 If you gonna rap, please stop, run away 
 Go home, flush your crack then give your gun away 
 'Cause the rules is written down in invisible ink 
 Just consider what the critical think 
 Don't rat, do ya bid in the clink 
 Stand tall little boy 
 Get ya self a shank, if you feelin' paranoid 
 But real talk, ****, jail talk, I know home sweet 
 Even locked down in a cage is where you don't be 
 Alone in the street 
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 o'clock in the morning 
 You know I'm trying to see more 
 Alone in the street 
 All day, all night, all by myself 
 You know that I'm all right 
 Alone in the street 
 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 p.m. 
 You know I trying to get it in 
 Alone in the street 
 All day, all night
