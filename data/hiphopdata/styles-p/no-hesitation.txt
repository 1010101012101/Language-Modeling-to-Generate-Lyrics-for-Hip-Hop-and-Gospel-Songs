Gotta make my moves I don't hesitate 
 Foreclosing move on your real estate 
 Burnt trash I incinerate, pen dancing 
 Sliding over ice like it was laced with figure skates 
 Urban legend talks around like lettuce dressing 
 Make an impression, give fresh no second guessing 
 I'm visible, original like ??? conception 
 My perception, only prescribed by permission 
 Chemical, I write novels like Charles Dickens 
 The plot thickens while you caught sleeping 
 Instrumentals move the crowd when I'm not speaking 
 Hesitate, make a mistake, I start creeping 
 From out the woody where we smack you out your hoody shirt 
 While you seem like a, my fingernails dirt 
 It represents me 
 I never hesitate, next up to demonstrate 
 How I took the featherweight title to the heavyweight 
 Tougher than the leather I would carry on my vinyl crates 
 Rough around the edges mother fucker I ain't trying to race 
 Trying to get my mind straight to lace another banger 
 So I ain't constantly relying on these strangers 
 Trying to get my pace off one off before my anger 
 Danger, two shots, one up in the chamber 
 I never hesitate ??? like my resume 
 First words come to my brain I keep I set it scrape 
 I said its fake, I said its bait 
 I said I laid the worm on the hook and set a fucking state 
 My center space is my center of crime 
 I'm descended from a list of those who center they mind 
 And setting a and sighting my prime 
 So every line is aged but ain't a sign of the times 
 Step 
 Can't hesitate head show me levitate 
 Kush help me meditate, trying to get my cheddar straight 
 Ahead of my time therefore I'm never late 
 Can never be, got that prime megatron pedigree 
 On the high echelon never get next to me 
 On the move got legs like a centipede 
 You can meet me at the table like the Geneves?? 
 Real boss nigga all will remember me 
 Alchemist and Evidence this is ??? 
 With those? there them niggas roll thicker than the president 
 Make a move nigga why you being hesitant 
 You can die off the work that devil does 
 If you G'd up get up on my level blood 
 If you hardcore get up on my rebel 'cause 
 Pop him in the head like whatever what 
 He's a has been mother fucker or a never was
