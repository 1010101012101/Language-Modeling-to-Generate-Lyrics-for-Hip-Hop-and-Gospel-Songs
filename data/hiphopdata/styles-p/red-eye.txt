I go with it, I'm so with it 
 First class flight overseas, I'm low with it 
 Stretching out the chair, wearin' low in it 
 Thinkin' of a house in Cali, can I grow in it? 
 Throw a booth in the place, imagine how I'd flow in it 
 Outer space bars, Ozs to the face, y'all 
 Bowl by the hottub in case, y'all 
 Plush life, laugh and I smile a lot 
 Light it up, bottle pop 
 Blowin' kush from San Diego to Ottawa 
 A long way from the days I used to bottle up 
 Keeping all of my feelings bottled up 
 Keeping all of the guns hollowed up 
 Now we gettin' rich, gettin' twisted like Oliver 
 Money, pile it up, yeah 
 The first go around, then again when we follow up 
 Money, power, kush, sour 
 Haze, airy, pills, powder 
 Pull it out, cock back, let the lead fly 
 Then a nigga gone on the red eye 
 Money, power, kush, sour 
 Haze, airy, pills, powder 
 Pull it out, cock back, let the lead fly 
 Then a nigga gone on the red eye 
 Livin' and drivin' in big shit 
 If I die tonight, fuck it, my kids rich 
 Sick shit, get your wig split 
 Nothin' personal, real nig shit 
 I'm on fire, you just smokin' 
 Playin' tennis with my connect, US Open 
 Block's my office, no days off it 
 The loudest person's usually the softest 
 Coke is gorgeous, ice is flawless 
 It's repercussions that come with all this 
 Gun off safety till they come and replace me 
 You know what they say, death comes in Tracys 
 Money, power, kush, sour 
 Haze, airy, pills, powder 
 Pull it out, cock back, let the lead fly 
 Then a nigga gone on the red eye 
 Money, power, kush, sour 
 Haze, airy, pills, powder 
 Pull it out, cock back, let the lead fly 
 Then a nigga gone on the red eye 
 More fun than festivals 
 Audemars and oysters perpetuals 
 Goon niggas that turn niggas to vegetables 
 Long as it's coke, being broke's unacceptable 
 Word to the zero that go after the decimal 
 May I double the way I bubble 
 Them ballers, the shit that brought AI trouble 
 If rap had a Dave Stern, believe I'm him 
 Think not? Bet the money in your Levis, then 
 Digital analogue 
 Always had catalogue, the bulls for the matador 
 But if I see red like the Bulls do 
 Somebody's gettin' shot and won't pull through 
 Got more animals than a zoo do 
 Yeah, it's Ghost The Grand 
 Motherfuckers should scram or get killed with they man 
 Money, power, kush, sour 
 Haze, airy, pills, powder 
 Pull it out, cock back, let the lead fly 
 Then a nigga gone on the red eye 
 Money, power, kush, sour 
 Haze, airy, pills, powder 
 Pull it out, cock back, let the lead fly 
 Then a nigga gone on the red eye
