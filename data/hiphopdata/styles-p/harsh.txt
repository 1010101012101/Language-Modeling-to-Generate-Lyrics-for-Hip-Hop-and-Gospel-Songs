(Intro: Busta Rhymes) 
 You know! 
 One day I got a call from the Ghost who told me I had to get on this conference call 
 To discuss a little business with him and the homey Rozay 
 Know the situation transpired where a nigga had to get dealt with a little harshly 
 Yeah! 
 (Verse 1: Styles P) 
 Root for the villain and shoot with no feelin' 
 Like Audio Two yeah the crew is "Top Billin" 
 Blowin' the dutch in the coupe with no ceilin 
 Invisible bully like the Gooch when I'm illin 
 Cash too green, it's taped to the toilet 
 Like I'm Michael Corleone in the bathroom scene 
 Young black Vito, chopped and wrapped kilos 
 Clap torpedoes, stack, Doritos 
 We in the Mexico sippin the Mojito 
 Discussin perico, green weed and diesel 
 AK, nozzle air holes you can see through 
 Ridin' the bulletproof five, yeah, I'm lethal 
 (Chorus: Busta Rhymes) 
 Yo! When niggas hear this shit they say it's (HARSH!) 
 Type of shit that make you wanna handle a nigga (HARSH!) 
 Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (HARSH!) 
 And like a Rothchild with money I'm kinda (HARSH!) 
 How we dealin' with 'em! (harsh!) how we dealin' with 'em! (harsh!) 
 How we handlin 'em! (harsh!) how we mandlin 'em! (harsh!) 
 Stop bitchin you the one who done 'cause me to act! (harsh!) 
 And if I'm itchin and you front it's my duty to act! 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ross) 
 Style is infectious, actress in a Lexus 
 Sunroof open had cheese for breakfast 
 Beef never settled I'm Lyor to the ghetto (HUH!) 
 Russell with the hustle Rick Rubin with the metal 
 When I lick a shot I'm aimin at ya top floor (WOO!) 
 Blocks like stock everybody bought more (HUH!) 
 Birds fell out the sky, rats could drop dead 
 Flyin through Bed-Stuy, white drop head 
 Sticky green twist, guillotine click (HUH!) 
 Dapper Dan three piece suit for the trip 
 Link with Dominicanos, straight pesos fritos 
 Three point range hit free throws with kilos 
 (Chorus: Busta Rhymes) 
 Yo! When niggas hear this shit they say it's (HARSH!) 
 Type of shit that make you wanna handle a nigga (HARSH!) 
 Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (HARSH!) 
 And like a Rothchild with money I'm kinda (HARSH!) 
 How we dealin' with 'em! (harsh!) how we dealin' with 'em! (harsh!) 
 How we handlin 'em! (harsh!) how we mandlin 'em! (harsh!) 
 Stop bitchin you the one who done 'cause me to act! (harsh!) 
 And if I'm itchin and you front it's my duty to act! 
 (Verse 3: Styles P) 
 Shine like brightenin sure but I'm the titan 
 Hard like when Customato was trainin Tyson 
 Gun we react in the car but no license 
 Life on top of the city could touch lightenin 
 Cocaine wave, dollar bill slave 
 Rangler is tough but the inside is suede 
 Ride with Louch and 'Kiss until I see a grave 
 One third of a legacy 
 Pedigree is I can make a don a don 'cause of integrity 
 Rap like a phenomenon sleep for a better dream 
 Nine is for better things smoke for medicine 
 BIG is the only rapper I don't think that I'm better than 
 (Chorus: Busta Rhymes) 
 Yo! When niggas hear this shit they say it's (HARSH!) 
 Type of shit that make you wanna handle a nigga (HARSH!) 
 Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (HARSH!) 
 And like a Rothchild with money I'm kinda (HARSH!) 
 How we dealin' with 'em! (harsh!) how we dealin' with 'em! (harsh!) 
 How we handlin 'em! (harsh!) how we mandlin 'em! (harsh!) 
 Stop bitchin you the one who done 'cause me to act! (harsh!) 
 And if I'm itchin and you front it's my duty to act! 
 (Verse 4: Busta Rhymes) 
 Yo! I rub stones together and cast a spell quick Like 
 Like a Zoe hittin voodoo blessings 'fore I move bricks 
 I beat you like the number eleven with two sticks 
 Money from the door and then when I bop with two chicks (COME ON!) 
 It won't stop never stop there he go again (HUH!) 
 Together watch the coke and have the bakin soda sort of blend (HA!) 
 Fredricka kinda pure see how we make the fiends flock 
 And watch the lines for the coke a quickly wrap around the block 
 They say we bad for business 'cause the coke price dropped 
 How we flooded and we bubble white till it's white hot (WHAT!) 
 Pot purchases we chop it up to pieces 
 Till only the shake is left countin' the profit and a bezel (WOO!) 
 Eight million dollar yacht, scotch, a little refer 
 Diamonds so big they call it obnoxious little creature (OH!) 
 Money to cop original paintings of Mona Lisa 
 High the way I feel a cloud sittin' on my caesar 
 (Chorus: Busta Rhymes) 
 Yo! When niggas hear this shit they say it's (HARSH!) 
 Type of shit that make you wanna handle a nigga (HARSH!) 
 Act hostile, aggressive and kinda (HARSH!) 
 And like a Rothchild with money I'm kinda (HARSH!) 
 How we dealin' with 'em! (harsh!) how we dealin' with 'em! (harsh!) 
 How we handlin 'em! (harsh!) how we mandlin 'em! (harsh!) 
 Stop bitchin you the one who done 'cause me to act! (harsh!) 
 And if I'm itchin and you front it's my duty to act!
