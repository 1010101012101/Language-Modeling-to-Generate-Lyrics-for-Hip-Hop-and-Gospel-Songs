Oh! Most of us came from a broken home, 
 Drowning all my sorrows, 
 Drinking liquor trying to smoke alone 
 Arguing with my wife so I broke the phone, 
 But the plane is on! 
 Is acting funny with the work, 
 Like my money didn't work, 
 He gonna end up getting murdered. 
 The acting funny with the 
 Like the shit that I spit on the record wasn't real! 
 Hood man, but they know 
 But they end up in jealousy to end a nigger high! 
 The other day I say fuck 
 When I play the bodega it was dance for the Dutch. 
 Keep it real, we're living in real time, 
 And I'm feeling the niggers' pain, 
 But they never can feel mine! 
 So I'm a go with the green light, 
 I don't even sleep, how the fuck could I dream right? 
 Yeah, yeah! 
 And you keep telling me things are getting better, 
 Yeah, yeah! 
 But I'm a do me, you can say whatever I'm a G! 
 Guess it's a sad think my is magic! 
 I remember I never I never said December was cold, 
 But February was drastic, 
 My niggers and what they 
 When the murder scene is tragic! 
 Niggers can talk shit, we don't even glimpse, 
 Niggers can get hit, we don't even wince! 
 Entourage and I don't mean Vince, 
 Purple label and purple Porsche 
 I look into the sky life, my life 
 And I zip my lips the minute they read my rights. 
 Blowin' on a lone Dutch in here 
 How I lie, rather die to be in jail, 
 It's so good till it's all bad, 
 And the ugly niggers gonna crash your broad's 
 I keep on moving on my new on the blocks, 
 The young boys move 
 I salute 'cause it's the west like 
 What they do for 
 In the nights your brain is out when the cocaine 
 Again I know my men got life out the game, 
 Don't stop so pull the weed out tonight's 
 Yeah, it's like that 
 My down South niggers they got 
 My East Coast niggers they got the 
 You found what your friends did. 
 I throw this money over bitches, 
 But niggers so let's kick it! 
 If you really live by the G code shoot a couple of guns, 
 Hurry up and reload!
