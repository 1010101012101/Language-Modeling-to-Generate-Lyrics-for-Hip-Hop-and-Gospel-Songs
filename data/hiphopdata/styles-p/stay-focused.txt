The ghost is deeper then most is 
 Leave out the house grab the toasters stuck in the sofa 
 Pop in the clip, hop in the whip 
 Tryna get the last drop 'fore the drip 
 Hoody time, any hood ride, fall back and get good and high 
 Where the phone at, next to the cogn'yac 
 Bring your chrome at wherever you bone at 
 Its on black, but you shouldve known that 
 I hit a dutch, hit another one then rip a clutch 
 I get your block blickerd up, bitch nigga what 
 It feel good to hit a real hood, I could then and I still could 
 'Cause my 9 millers real good 
 I'm comin' for you and then I'm gunnin for you 
 I don't get blunted with you, get hundreds with you 
 Bitch nigga imma kill you if I wanted with you 
 You could join on the listen or get your number issued 
 (Style P adlibs) 
 Catch me where the haze is, sticky like gum is 
 The guns is louder than thunder 
 You could get rained on dependin on what cloud that you under 
 Ain't nothin' fouler then hunger, I wonder... about alot of shit 
 You ever shot a clip, I got a brick 
 Me, I did alot of shit, but no scholarship 
 Give a crackhead the keys and let 'em polish it 
 Streetlife don't abolish it, they breakin rules now 
 Makin' rattin seem cool now, you should rap the fuckin' fool down 
 Learnt the game from an old timer, big money makes the hoes find ya 
 Why you think he so charmin, I could dig it like a gold miner 
 I ain't lame and I can't forget the game with old timers 
 This is S.P the ghost, puffin on a bone 
 In the zone where it affects me the most 
 (Style P adlibs) 
 Pocket full of a d.ps, honeys from d.c 
 Cayenne with the TV, livin' is easy 
 Back in 6th grade, who would believe me 
 Switchblade-crazy with my clothes lookin' greezy 
 Now I'm the boss of the bosses 
 If you think you married to the streets 
 I could make you divorce it 
 Always hear me speak where the porch is 
 I think it's the horses and how it zigzag through on the courses 
 Big bags of money try grabbin a fortune 
 The real get real, gotta spend it with caution 
 I ain't really into flossin 
 Imma stay dark, follow you home and get into your porshe and 
 The guns on fire like stovetops 
 You think you on the road to petitionin 
 But heres where the road stops 
 I ain't tryna fall, I just want it all 
 Why don't you let me get the ball 
 Imma show you the globe trot
