Baby you been there 
 (You my ride or die chick) 
 Nobody else was you my ride or die I love you forever 
 (Baby you my ride or die chick) 
 Why do you do, the things you do, just for me 
 While niggas hated by my side you stayed 
 And you did that for me, and you didn't have to 
 For that I love you, you trusted me I trusted you 
 You confide in me, I confide in you 
 Now that's why I can say, when I said it that day 
 Can we get married you said yes 
 And it stayed that way 
 For me you'll ride or die, I look in your eyes 
 I'll see the sun set tonight together forever and forever 
 For me you'll ride or die, I look in your eyes 
 I'll see the sun set, tonight, together forever me and my baby 
 Its pf neva play games witcha 
 Have ya screamin go dav when I put the thang in ya 
 You in the roles so I put the range in ya 
 Cocked back, reload I ain't shootin blanks in ya 
 Give ya ass lil patch of the window 
 Go the woodgrain you might catch a lil splinter 
 I get deep posted in it like a center 
 In the middle tell my mama I'll be gone till November 
 Pf keep floatin like a symbol 
 You feel the beats grow as the lights get dimmer 
 And you want me 'cause ya man way thinner but 
 What he don't know baby it he will neva get ta kn 
 For me you'll ride or die, I look in your eyes 
 I'll see the sun set tonight together forever and forever 
 For me you'll ride or die, I look in your eyes 
 I'll see the sun set, tonight together forever me and my baby 
 Dey call me suga baby, I'm goin' supa davy 
 Half zips and sacks is what I'm movin baby 
 I gotta strip from haitis, I'm n da new mercedes 
 I'm bout ta string da bitch out like a ukaleli 
 I'm puffin purp wit vitamens and enzymes 
 So how I drift in da breeze like some wind chimes 
 Cruise wit da kid were da climate is tropical 
 To da pad we gotta go on da coast of golopagose 
 The boy hot but the car like a popsicle 
 And the roof on the whip is optional 
 Wood interior you know its mahogany 
 Sex so good you callin out olli oxen free 
 For me you'll ride or die, I look in your eyes 
 I'll see the sun set together forever and forever 
 For me you'll ride or die, I look in your eyes 
 I'll see the sun set, tonight together forever me and my baby 
 Enjoy ya self wit a lil fresh seed 
 Go bak bak ta bak second double dis week 
 Go cruisin in da east meetin up wit our people 
 Duckin the police we ain't neva been free tho 
 And I got this proposition you see 
 Backseat position its ya friends and me 
 I will keep the confidentiality 
 Because I like ya body, voice, and personality 
 You got style you got grace 
 U gotta size 5 size 6 waist 
 You gotta go hard and not against 
 U makE somethin' get hard in my pants 
 Are you my love, are you my lust 
 Or are you just a quick nut to bust 
 Could you be my baby nd da othas might not make da cut 
 And you gon mess wit me wen da sun comes up 
 Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa yeaaa yeaaaa baby 
 I love u I love you forever 
 Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa yeaaaa yeaaaaa 
 I love you I love you baby I love you
