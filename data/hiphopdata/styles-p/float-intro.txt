Hardest nigga 
 Slim 
 G'd up 
 Goes 
 Ignorant niggerish, holiday shootin at the cigarette 
 While the shit is lit in yo mouth 
 And you gotta be kiddin me nigga 
 I'm like an Italy nigga 
 On some mob shit, figure me out 
 Can't stop me, I'm Luca Grassi 
 From the book, not the picture though 
 You ain't talkin' me, I keep the nickeload 
 The Kansas made for Nicolo and me too 
 Lightin weed, this way green in the be soup 
 Wronger than the oil from the tea tree 
 Singin' aloud, playing the Beegees, nigga take it easy 
 And my new name is D Rock 
 Hearts throwed back as if you so afraid to ease up 
 I'm a genius and a retard 
 Just the other day I stopped to piss onto these cars 
 You sweet and your heart pump Kool Aid 
 Block might take off yo top like it's a tope 
 Probly blowin' booty, mixed with the sour 
 Riff right now will get you clipped in a hour 
 If it's corn that's 2, get hit with the 3-4 times 5 star 
 General coming through (you the man!) 
 Ask me to go since Scram Jones 
 You don't want yo brains on yo man's phone 
 You don't want my niggas and yo fam's on me 
 Won't see shit like you caught up in a sandstorm 
 SS S be the deuce 
 5 star general, you die if you try me 
 Any nigga in the city murdered 
 SS S be the deuce 
 Wasn't me, I was smoking weed with his bodyguard 
 Motherfuckin, this is beast music 
 All these rappers is food, I feast to it
