(Feat. The Game, Nas) 
 (Tony Montana from Scarface: talking) 
 All I have in this world is my balls and my word, and I don't break them for no one. You understand. 
 (Chorus x2: The Game) 
 Lord forgive me my sins, I know it's last minute 
 Put the chronic in the air, a little hash in it 
 Spread my wings, if only I could fly 
 Why fight to live homie if we livin' to die 
 Styles P: 
 I don't give a fuck what many men wish 
 I from the D Block, clickin out semi auto shit 
 P a hustler, I'm a a double levy, penny I get 
 And that's words to my haze and my remy I sip 
 And you can pray to God and play the yard 
 I throw the laser on the 89 and spray your squad 
 Nah, use to have hopes and dreams 
 Now it's locs with coats with triple beams 
 With machine guns fiends. 
 Nas: 
 Rock the world might be like colors and gangs 
 Follow my side brothers would [? ] for different thangs 
 But it all revovle around [? ] and shorties 
 Suffer your bling [? ] for your chain, the same story 
 From checoslovakia, the Texas metropilis, the tretorous foxes, and the Mexican mafia 
 They scrappin with tats on their backs, valid wars 
 Nothin' less then the lethal injection if ever caught 
 Court rooms, eagles, and flags, American style 
 While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul 
 Whatchin for pain chips, throwin' no lead at your child 
 But them gangstas pulloutin your child 
 The berry be out, the chain be like 100k 
 Shining since roxane shaunte made runaway 
 That's been a minute, genisis is deep, my feature are that of a god 
 Is not a [? ], it's a fact that these rappers wanna be Nas.
