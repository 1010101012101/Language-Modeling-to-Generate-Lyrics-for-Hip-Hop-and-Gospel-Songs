(Featuring Styles Of Beyond) 
 Get ready 
 Get ready, get set 
 Get ready, get set, let's roll 
 Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll 
 Road warrior in a bit of petrol 
 Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow 
 S.o.b 
 You ain't never seen nothing so rugged at 90 
 Uh huh, motha'fucka with the cops behind me yo! 
 The boiler's grinding, keep the cuffs, enjoy your doughnuts sir, you ain't gonna find me 
 It's not likely their brains is blown out 
 You're chasing a ghost with no brakes, slow down 
 Hundred proof octane, ready to drink bitch 
 Stop playing, I'm hot man, gimme that pink slip 
 Time's up, the animals crept through 
 Leave them in the dust with a packet of jet fuel 
 Too quick, eat 'em up, better for pet food 
 No brain, slow lane, missing your head screws 
 Skin and bones let mess with your chrome set 
 Tricked out, hopping like your cruse in a cold chest 
 Parked in eagle with a safety pin 
 Take the backseat, now let the games begin, yeah 
 Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll 
 Road warrior in a bit of petrol 
 Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow 
 Shape shifter 
 Come on man, you can't be real 
 I'll show you what it is, let the anthem build 
 Shape shifter 
 Put the pedal to the metal and go 
 Tough match, you lost by a hubcap 
 The big boss spray painted on my mud flap 
 Get a rush, yeah we're calling your cold bluff 
 Can never get enough 
 Step in, hold your breath and hang tight 
 Known for the big dollar bet in the cage fight 
 You're playing with the sharks, step inside 
 Everybody on your mark, get set, now let's ride. 
 That's right, put the pedal to the metal and go 
 The yellow madellow with slicks on sending 'em home 
 Stick cars in the concrete, gripping the road 
 So quick, get in the palm trees, look out, whoa 
 We got car keys hooked to remote controls 
 Hit a button that'll smoke any whip you own 
 I told you, I don't want to close your casket 
 Quit now before you go blowing a gasket 
 Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll 
 Road warrior in a bit of petrol 
 Red, yellow, hit green, then go, breathe in slow 
 Shape shifter 
 Come on man, you can't be real 
 I'll show you what it is, let the anthem build 
 Shape shifter 
 Put the pedal to the metal and go 
 Melting, meltdown 
 While time is shifting 
 Transist, transform 
 Yielding, bending (out purposly) 
 While time is shifting 
 Two shapes they can't get straight 
 Get ready, get set, let's roll 
 Shape shifter 
 Come on man, you can't be real 
 I'll show you what it is, let the anthem build 
 If you want it, come and let me know 
 I'm right here, put the pedal to the metal and go 
 Shape shifter 
 Come on man, you can't be real 
 I'll show you what it is, let the anthem build 
 Shape shifter 
 Put the pedal to the metal and go
