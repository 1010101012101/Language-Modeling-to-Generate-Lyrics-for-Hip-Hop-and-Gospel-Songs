 (Styles P) 
 Nigga I'll hawk your ass, want to fit in my shoes 
 And you cowards can't walk my path 
 (Sl) 
 I don't know nobody fuckin' wit us 
 I ain't Gerome Bettis but if I hit you it's gon feel like the bus 
 (Sp) 
 And you couldn't live this life and play this role 
 Like never part with your gun and stay this cold 
 (Sl) 
 Yo we in the streets where it's nothin' but love 
 I'm them leather shits, you the Michael Jackson glove

 If I was you I woulda never made it 
 I'm Holiday so I'm celebrated 
 (Sl) 
 We don't reminisce bitch ass, remember that 
 Styles verse is the only thing gon bring it back 
 (Sp) 
 Tell the ghetto show discipline 
 I said Sheek gun Puerto Rican, bullets stay whistlin 
 Sheek and SP in and out, all for the streets 
 Turn the bass up and try not to fuck up your seats 
 Rock that shit, every corner, knock that shit 
 Niggaz try to front on us, cock that shit 
 (Sl) 
 I guess I'm gettin' older 
 Cause everybody that I thought was hot go inside the garbage folder 
 (Sp)

 Raise it to your cheek nigga, dare you to speak 
 (Sp)

 And thugs that'll give a nigga a hug and say they stab anyone 
 (Sl) 
 You ain't never seen a nigga jaw hangin' from his face 
 Sausage shaped red shit hangin' from his waist 
 (Sp) 
 Nigga I'm well connected 
 By the time you hear this I'll be in jail but I probly got two cells 
 Connected 
 (Sl) 
 Yack in one hand, the other the lizm 
 And If I push you down and wet you it's not baptism 
 (Sp)

 It won't stop till they put you in the dirt with the flowers on top of ya 
 (Sl) 
 Sheek goin' broke is not in the plans 
 I could sell gloves to a nigga with no hands 
 (Sp) 
 A lot of niggaz screamin they wolf, but I'm feelin' they sheep 
 I won't be happy till the niggaz asleep 
 (Sl) 
 I'll punch a niggaz nose in, duckin and bustin' 
 Cuttin' and cussin, hold that you bitch ass nigga 
 (Sp) 
 And I could make the best die 
 Cut your throat open, pull your tongue through it 
 That's a fuckin' neck tie

 Pump turn niggaz voices like they hit a helium balloon
