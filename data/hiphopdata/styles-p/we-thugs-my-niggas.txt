All for one, one for all 
 This is motherfuckin' beautiful 
 Talk to 'em baby 
 This for the cold D's that won't snitch 
 For the murderers that won't miss 
 For the hustlers that'll front bricks 
 For the hood rats that want chips 
 For the stick-up kids creepin' with they pump's ripped 
 For lil' shorty with his rhyme books 
 Black girls going to school, carryin' like 9 books 
 For the hood niggas that go to work because parole 
 But they tryin' to be good niggas 
 For all the poor mothers that's always goin' through the struggle 
 Still screamin' at the Lord, love us 
 For the ghetto life, for havin' to hold your medal tight 
 Lookin' for a better life 
 For the family, for if I'm rich you rich 
 And that shit's a guarantee, for the best of life 
 For if I ride you ride the motherfuckin' rest of life 
 We thugs, my niggas, ride to the death with my man 
 'Cause I motherfuckin' love my niggas 
 We ghetto, my niggas, anytime, any place 
 We don't give a fuck we bust metal, my niggas 
 We gangsta my niggas, you oughta keep your mouth shut 
 Watch what you sayin' 'cause we shank you my niggas 
 We D-Block niggas, we don't play games 
 We just hit you in your frame 'cause we pop niggas 
 Aiyyo, yo, Imma shed blood for mine, that's one ritual 
 That's how you keep the love unconditional 
 That's why we the only one the thugs listen to 
 Bitches buy records but niggas do what bitches do 
 I know a few dudes doin' life bids in jail 
 And they way smarter then the white kids in Yale 
 But that how life is and that how the gun and the knife is 
 It's a shame but it's real when your enemies like ya 
 When ya come through and fishtail in Hennessey Viper 
 Listen, it ain't the rappers, it's the rats that worry me 
 Double R for life, D-Block till they bury me 
 Scared niggas shed offer, stand in the back 
 And aim they gat up in the air and let off 
 Througho niggas tear nigga head off 
 Then let the blood keep drippin' 
 And just wipe the sweat off 
 We thugs, my niggas, ride to the death with my man 
 'Cause I motherfuckin' love my niggas 
 We ghetto, my niggas, anytime, any place 
 We don't give a fuck we bust metal, my niggas 
 We gangsta my niggas, you oughta keep your mouth shut 
 Watch what you sayin' 'cause we shank you my niggas 
 We D-Block niggas, we don't play games 
 We just hit you in your frame 'cause we pop niggas 
 Fuck with P, the thug'll come out, the slug'll come out 
 You don't put in enough work, I got chu, no doubt 
 They don't want Sheek to wild, betta cover ya child 
 With two guns out the sun-roof, stop us now 
 Who that kid? Black mask on with the latch on, the AK 
 Swing on my shoulder like a Louie bag 
 You get it in a hurry all up in your Burberry 
 Through your assistant, you'll be set fuckin' secretary 
 All y'all do me a favor, walk with me 
 If you want money or drugs, talk with me 
 Know I got my niggas my guns, now hawk with me 
 Guess who? Jada, P and The Sheek 
 Three bricks, three whips, three motherfucking ouies a week 
 Ten spots OT, two blew off late 
 My niggas cop, pop and talk and we applying the pressure 
 So when you address us, it's boss, boss and boss 
 We thugs, my niggas, ride to the death with my man 
 'Cause I motherfuckin' love my niggas 
 We ghetto, my niggas' anytime, any place 
 We don't give a fuck' we bust metal, my niggas 
 We gangsta my niggas, you oughta keep your mouth shut 
 Watch what you sayin' 'cause we shank you my niggas 
 We D-Block niggas, we don't play games 
 We just hit you in your frame 'cause we pop niggas
