Guess who's coming to dinner mighty Block 
 Guess who's coming to dinner mighty mighty Block 
 D-Block- oh-oh-oh-oh D-Block 
 (Louder, louder, yeah, Don Don) 
 Okay I lyrically ejaculate 
 I come on tracks go 'head and hate 
 Go inside, run and hide 
 'Cause this gon boost the murder rate 
 Flying with the long behind me 
 Nickel plate, extra shiny 
 Got this woman on my tip like they name is Tiny 
 Every hood, light is up, dark liquor, plastic cup 
 Sour diesel, hoodie on, gun out like what the fuck 
 Porsche turbo, Yankee blue, Derek Jeter of his crew 
 Rosa, feet up, deuce deuce in my shoe 
 Ten years on radio, ten years on mixtapes 
 Did deals with everybody, even survived the Puff rape 
 Now I'm all bossed up, watch all glossed up 
 D block, we hard in the streets, put your signs up 
 (Aha, the one and only, the mighty might) 
 Money ain't shit to me, respect means more to me 
 We define loyalty 
 This is rap royalty 
 Let the fo five off, live for, die for 
 Hustle is my first love, and the streets my side hoe 
 Haze then I'm back to sour 
 Okay I'm back in power 
 Business man nine to five, hooligan after hours 
 Ain't nobody to compare to what we contribute 
 The bars is like the possession, with intent to strip you 
 My hand, wrist, ears and neck laid 
 Nothing but straight fire for a decade 
 I'm in the polo rounds, polo down, 
 Feelin' like when Tony put Manolo down 
 Ya all know who control the town 
 This is for my Looters and shooters 
 With them deserts, and rugars and lugers 
 Who was newest to beat, talk to us, huh? 
 I got 'em don don, fully black Armani yan (?) 
 Mi not play wit dem facey boys, shut it down 
 Keep my barrel spinnin', that's why ratty warm 
 Have you marked for death, you're whole family gone 
 Got 'em pounds of that green we call it the Hawks 
 D-Block, one time, we call it new york 
 Get money, hit honeys on the regular 
 Bully stay in peoples ear like a cellular 
 Now the World and your girl they all know my name 
 Got 'em Trey Songing, Bullys insane 
 Never been to Yonkers before neither entrepreneur 
 And I'm a monster for sure 
 Like Godzilla 
 Shoot is on your death, cut ya deck like a card dealer 
 Puffin on the lies, spent a buck at the car dealer 
 They tryna say d block is negative 
 Any rapper breathing is breathing 'cause we let 'em live 
 I can tell you why these soft suckas mad at me 
 They can see I got every kind of flags with me 
 Honor flags, ? flags, game flags 
 It's a D Block, everywhere we bangs at 
 Money long, run long, bullets long 
 Word to your hood, if you got a hood, put it on
