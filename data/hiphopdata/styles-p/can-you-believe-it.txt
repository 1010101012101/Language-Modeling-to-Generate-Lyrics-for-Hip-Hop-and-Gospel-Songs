(Styles P & Akon talking) 
 What up John (testing one, two, three) 
 What up Kon (hey convict music) 
 Let's go (can you believe it) 
 (1st Verse) Styles P 
 Fresh white tee, fresh car walls, summertime hood niggas look like stars 
 Jewelry drip, fresh white airs, mommy shake it up keep your ass right there (oh, can you believe it?) 
 My man got liquor and my cup's right here, I can smell smoke pass the dutch right here 
 Nigga pass that, Capri pants with the waist cut off, I wanna smash that (oh, can you believe it?) 
 Party ran pack, mingling baby, and I can LL shake, you jingling baby? 
 Back your ass up, I'm a start tingling baby, we can have more fun if wiggling baby (yeah, can you believe it?) 
 P hit the club with a dutch and a dub with it, nigga don't cuff it if you ain't in love with it 
 Matter fact let the grub get it, please don't hate cause at least you can say you was with it 
 (Chorus) Akon 
 Can you believe it? Get a break and get off the streets, clear my mind from the shit I see 
 In a world full of smoke, contact from the weed, that's when it really bond on me 
 I'm a be here for life, I ain't never gonna leave, the ghetto is all that I know 
 It's just another day in the hood my nigga laying back trying get this dough 
 Yellin' out oh, all up in the club and you know how we roll, squad deep like oh 
 Bad little bitch*s with their booty on score trying to beat like whoa 
 Know your ass feel it cause its outta control 
 Let me hear you say oh, let me hear you say oh oh 
 Can you believe It? 
 (2nd Verse) Styles P 
 Big ass truck, brand new rims, tank top Yankee, tanned out Tims 
 Bracelet, chain, fronts bob thin, new tattoos, new black shoes (hey, can you believe it?) 
 Gucci, Ermays, do that too, wanna feel the breeze get a new black coupe 
 Nigga drop the top, come through the hood, put a hundred on your three or your foul line shot (ooh. ooh, oh can you believe it?) 
 Lending outfits all in the bus cause none of us could see a summer without trips (none of us can see it) 
 Mad hoops so the little boys might bark at you but they all lack good if the hood bothered you 
 (Chorus) Akon 
 Can you believe it? Get a break and get off the streets, clear my mind from the shit I see 
 In a world full of smoke, attack from the weed, that's when it really bond on me 
 I'm a be here for life, never gonna leave, the ghetto is all that I know 
 It's just another day in the hood my nigga laying back trying get this dough 
 Yellin' out oh, all up in the club and you know how we roll, squad deep like oh 
 Bad little bitch*s with their booty on score trying to beat like whoa 
 Know your ass feel it cause its outta control 
 Let me hear you say oh, let me hear you say oh oh 
 Can you believe It? 
 (3rd Verse) Styles P 
 Basketball tournament, pitbull pups 
 Ladies in the club poring Chris in cups 
 Niggas in the jail calling home on the phone ('cause they locked up) 
 But you still trying to act like ain't shit enough 
 Mad sieves in the park, mad fights in the park niggas talk how they run every night from the narcs 
 Aside from the light to the dark then the dark to the light, I wanna smoke but I could search for my life 
 (Last Verse) Akon 
 Can you believe it? I've done spent ten again, watching her bend again, dancing for many men 
 Tell me have ever though about getting in, a room full of convicts and D Block militants 
 We'll show you the time of your life, you can occupy my passenger side 
 Introduce you to the street life, watch you fall in love after just one night 
 Oh, all up in the club and you know how we roll, squad deep like oh 
 Bad little bitch*s with their booty on score trying to beat like whoa 
 Know your ass feel it cause its outta control 
 Let me hear you say oh, let me hear you say oh oh 
 Can you believe It? 
 (Styles P & Akon talking) 
 Can you believe It? (Can you believe It?) 
 Lil' John, Akon, S.P. the ghost 
 Feel what we trying to do (Can you believe It?) 
 Can you believe It (Can you believe It?)
