(Breathing in) 
 Ya ya what up my niggas, 
 You know who it is, 
 It's your nigga Styles, 
 Holiday, the Ghost Pinero, 
 I go by many names, 
 I am just glad to be doing this motherfucking album, 
 I am happy to be alive, 
 It's been awhile, 
 I got a lot of shit to say, 
 I just want everbody in this motherfucking world to hear me out, 
 Real street nigger, 
 I am a badass motherfucker
