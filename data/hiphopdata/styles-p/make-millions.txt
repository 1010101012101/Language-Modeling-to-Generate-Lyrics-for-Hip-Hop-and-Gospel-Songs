East Coast Mcee's 
 Down South MC's 
 Never Fucking Forget | Whose the HARDEST MC! 
 You on the MTV list 
 I put ya Brains all over ya MTV Crib 
 Whoever wrote that ~ Double XL this 
 I Double XL whoever you felt spit 
 All these niggas with these A, B, C raps 
 Me I kick "G" Raps | Guns bust keys wraped 
 Fuck niggas, never bother me! 
 Favorite 4 words "THIS IS A ROBBERY" 
 Next few words can be "Pardon Me, 
 That was an Artery 
 I don't know who the fuck started me." 
 You think you nice, I wonder who lied to you 
 You Butta, I'm a knife I slide through you 
 You think I'm Lying? 
 Where you live? I'll ride to you. 
 Just one Deep 
 Not 2 Deep 
 Put 3 holes in you Just like loose leaf 
 All bunch a holes in you 
 Just like a Kufi 
 If you know God or the Devil introduce me 
 It's the Ghost brother! 
 Get treated like a big bag of weed 
 And get mother fucking smoked brother 
 Cut the dumb shit 
 'Cause I run shit 
 You can get harmed when my palms on the gun grip 
 All I want is Millions, Thousands and Hundreds. 
 I'm money hungry 
 Whose serving? 
 We can go to war like the Spartans and The Persians 
 Riding in Suburbans with the couches and the curtains 
 Whose ruthless? I know I am 
 Make you sniff uncut dope out of Thailand 
 Can't see the God from the lense out the sky cam 
 Clear the vibe ride or the six ride 
 Get the baking soda tell them boys let the bricks fly 
 Keep bark buzz and the piff high 
 Put you in the ground 'cause I ain't letting shit fly 
 Too many fake niggas 
 With they Fake Ice 
 Talking Fake shit 
 You got a Fake life 
 38 in ya mouth ~ Tell me what it taste like 
 See me stop like you just seen break lights 
 Pinky ass nigga, that's yo ass nigga 
 50 cent gem star watch how it slash niggas 
 From the forehead 
 To the Adams apple 
 I'm a Battle Man, you a Battle Rapper 
 I'm talking real life shit 
 Body dead, money missing, real crisis 
 Real niggas know real talk 
 Word to the money Nod and every dollar peeled off 
 Word to every nigga that got his top peeled off 
 Catch me in the Corvette 
 High when I peel off
