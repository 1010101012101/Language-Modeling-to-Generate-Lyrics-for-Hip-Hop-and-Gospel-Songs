(Feat. Young Jeezy) 
 Yukmouth: 
 I went from old school Scrapers 
 To high top Forces 
 You couldn't walk a mile off in my Air Jordan's 
 And you ain't seen what I seen 
 I could get a quarter mil in these Makaveli Jeans 
 I went from old school Scrapers 
 To high top Forces 
 You couldn't walk a mile off in my Air Jordan's 
 And you ain't did what I did 
 Where you from, where I'm from 
 You gotta split a nigga weed 
 Yukmouth: 
 Everybody already know, Yuk a real thug nigga 
 When you see me in the streets, 
 I'm a real drug dealer [Young Jeezy:] (That's Right) 
 I hope you got yours 
 I keep mine 
 The AK had you faggots throwing peace signs 
 You better act like you know the facts 
 Platinum Dodge magnums packed in back with me, and E-Black [Young Jeezy:] (Yeah) 
 Them other niggas is weenies 
 What you spent on your crib 
 I spent it all on a GT [Yukmouth:] (HA HA) 
 In one night two bitches, three bottles of Chris 
 Two hundred grand spit 
 Just to put a glance at the whiff 
 Stay in beef so I carry that toaster 
 But don't talk shit my four fifth ferocious 
 [Young Jeezy:] (Yeah) 
 I not just my imagination 
 I know that I'm the reason why you faggots hating 
 [Young Jeezy:] (That's riggghhht) 
 The NMS sayin' Yuk got robbed

 Cause Yuk fuck with the mob... Yeah

 Young Jeezy: 
 Black tee, black One's and a Philly cap 
 The mach-11 make me walk with a crazy dack 
 Ay, Y'all say we country niggas, Yee-Ha 
 The money cartin back and forth like a see-saw 
 And y'all ain't never seen what we saw 
 Stacks of twenty dollar bills 
 Bricks of white rock 
 But they got little faith 
 They don't care about shit 
 Ludacris how they ride out with twenty dub bricks 
 [Young Jeezy:] (Yeah) 
 Should I spit it for y'all? 
 Or the real my niggas 
 Should I spit it for y'all? 
 Ay, who gives a fuck about friends 
 If you mix the baking soda with it 
 You can get a Benz 
 While your robbing and boosting 
 I'm standing over stove like the chef in Houston 
 And it's not about the flip man 
 Or the real bread dog 
 It's all about your rep man 
 Yukmouth:

 And you ain't did what I did 
 Where you from, where I'm from
