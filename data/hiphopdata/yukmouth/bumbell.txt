(Tech N9ne) (Yukmouth) 
 Regime killas, ah 
 What the deal 
 (It's that lethal) 
 What's poppin' 
 Regime niggas in this motherfucker for the one nine nine twist bitch 
 (Uh, that regime shit) 
 Regime shit, yeah 
 (Done deal, bumbell) 
 New millennium rhymers nigga 
 (What, tech a nina) 
 The bumbell 
 Where the fuck you at 
 (Up in this bitch) 
 (Yukmouth) (Tech N9ne) 
 Uh, what uh, introducin two of the Regime's finest 
 (Regime) Tech-a-Nina 
 And Smoke-a-Lot himself 
 (Smoke-a-Lot, bumbell) 
 Let's serve these niggas with the straight shh, uh nigga 
 (In your back bitch) 
 Fuck that, I'm tired of not being of the bungalow shit 
 This bumbell for you nigga 
 (Yukmouth) 
 It's bumbell bumbell, that's straight rapid fire 
 That override your ampliphiers and the woofers 
 Your bass tube hook ups shut the fuck up with wires cooked up 
 Niggas stash my tape like gats in the bushes, it's that lethal 
 It'll probably have you killing people, for real 
 Cops say it's illegal to have a Yuk tape in your possession 
 Niggas keep going to jail for 11, 350's and 211's 
 187's, concealed weapons, all the above 
 Tear the fuckin' club up with my nigga what 
 (Tech N9ne) 
 That Tech N9ne nigga, lyrically blind niggas on the grind 
 All the time you will find I spiritually define nigga, rhyme killa 
 I'm the purer from Missour-a 
 Quick when I rip shit trip this animalistic, fuck Ace Ventura 
 By the power of my dead niggas I'ma ride this like a rollercoaster 
 Ain't nobody fuckin' with my niggas, I'm the killa representin' Cosa Nostra 
 So bust like you're supposed to 
 We guaranteed this gon sell 'cause this shit's the bumbell nigga 
 (Chorus: (Tech N9ne)) x 2 
 (Ba bum) 
 This shit is heated (ba bum) 
 Your shit's deleted (ba bum) 
 And when you need it (ba bum) 
 We drunk and weeded 
 As long as this rap shit sells 
 Us niggas with figures we keep releasin' the bumbell 
 (Yukmouth) 
 Bitch I can make ya ? ven? (ba bum) 
 Make ya ? land? (ba bum) 
 Make the fans (ba bum) 
 Gang related dance (ba bum) 
 I can make the hood (ba bum) 
 Make your ? kim wood? (ba bum) 
 Make your stereo (ba bum) 
 Make calico (ba bum) 
 They dumpin' on us, clunk clunk go the trunk 
 Grab the pump, bang my shit when you in the mist to funk 
 Or get shit crunked 
 When shit jumps, I'm the theme music 
 Like Thorazine, the fiends cling to it 
 I didn't mean to do it 
 The music made me do it, it made me loose it 
 Got my mind playin' tricks 
 Now my nine can't stop sprayin' shit 
 Until the nigga lay in a ditch 
 And when I played this shit it blew my speakers out 
 Looked out the window I saw dope fiends and tweakers out in the 
 Middle of the street doing the electric slide, you shoulda peeped it out 
 It got me geeked out, hustlin' makin' scrilla 
 After every word I got to say "nigga" 
 Like: what's up nigga? 
 Let's smoke this blunt nigga 
 Oh, yesterday got caught, got fucked up nigga 
 You bumpin' Yuk nigga? 
 Oh that's the bumbell 
 (Tech N9ne) 
 We're now listening to the sounds of Tech N9ne 
 I don't need no medication, I just packs my crispy flows 
 Endo, rum and fornication, jammed up for y'all filthy hoes 
 That nigga named Tech N9ne is a motherfucker on Gang Related 
 Hater's gotta respect mine or the next time get strangulated 
 Rap-a-Lot summoned me, I told 'em that I had a gun in me 
 Loony as a nigga wanna be, kindly get the fuck from front of me 
 Sleepin' with a black cat in my lap, spliitin' poles daily 
 Under a lot of weight and on a bus on a broken mirror don't faze me 
 They say tech when I rap you wouldn't be alive 
 Fuck that, I got niggas lettin' 'em go for tweleve five, bumbell's live 
 We bringin' heat to the game, deep when we came 
 Niggas fucked up and put they feet to the flame 
 Got that (ish) if you want it, gives a (uff) I'm a flaunt it 
 That (ha) got niggas thinkin' I'm hunted, the bumbell 
 (Tech N9ne) (Yukmouth) 
 Yeah (live and direct) 
 KC meets Oakland, Oakland meets Houston, a killa mixture 
 (Bumbell) bumbell (what) 
 Tech N9ne (Regime shit) 
 Ish, uck, nigga 
 What you wanna do 
 Regime crew 
 Like that nigga 
 Me and Yuknouth up in this motherfucker puttin' this shit in your back 
 For the one nine nine twist 
 You know what I'm sizzlin? 
 You know what I'm sizzlin? 
 You know what I'm sizzlin?
