 If you're thuggin' and you know it, clap your hands 
 If you're thuggin' and you know it, clap your hands 
 If you're thuggin' and you know it 
 When you're hustlin, nigga, show it 
 If you're thuggin' and you know it, clap your hands 
 But if you're ballin and you know it, stomp your feet 
 But if you're ballin and you know it, stomp your feet 
 But if you're ballin and you know it 
 Shot-callin and you show it 
 If you're ballin and you know it, stomp your feet
