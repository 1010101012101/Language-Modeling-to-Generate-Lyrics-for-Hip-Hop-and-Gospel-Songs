When I got her love here 
 Look what (what) I've tumbled upon 
 The woman that sees me (me) for me 
 Not what I've done 
 You give me this (this) bling ba-ding [? ] 
 I give you my time 
 Girl you make me feel like everything's all right 
 You're sorta like 
 Hearing the birds churping in the morning light 
 Or maybe even receiving a kiss goodnight 
 Girl you got me believing we just might 
 End up bein more than jus two friends 
 When we're together it feels ideal 
 The sunny weather puts a smile right on my face 
 So why would I ever turn my back on what we had 
 Oh girl 
 You always bring that first day of spring 
 We kept things friendly (friendly) 
 Without crossing that boundary 
 Darling I'm expressing 
 Are you listening? 
 You give me that (that) bling ba-ding [? ] 
 To give you my time 
 Girl you make me feel like everything's all right 
 You're sorta like 
 Hearing the birds churping in the morning light 
 Or maybe even receiving a kiss goodnight 
 Girl you got me believing we just might 
 End up bein more than jus two friends 
 When we're together it feels ideal 
 The sunny weather puts a smile right on my face 
 So why would I ever turn my back on what we had 
 Oh girl 
 You always bring that first day of spring
