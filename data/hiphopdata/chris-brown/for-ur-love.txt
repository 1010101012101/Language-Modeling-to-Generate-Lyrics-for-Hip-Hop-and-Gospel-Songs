I'll wait for you 
 Till you come home 
 Here out alone 
 I stay alone for your love 
 For your love, for your love 
 For your love, for your love 
 For your love, for your love 
 With my pimp cup down 
 Nothing lost, nothing found 
 It's the things that you do 
 That makes me love you 
 Turn around and thump, thump 
 That's what I want you to do 
 Even when I want you 
 I hope you want me too 
 I'll wait for you 
 Till you come home 
 Here out alone 
 I stay alone for your love 
 For your love, for your love 
 For your love, for your love 
 For your love, for your love 
 And know what I'ma do now 
 I'ma keep you 'round 
 I like your teeth when you smile 
 And your booty is like wild 
 So turn around and thump, thump 
 Or I jump in your trunk 
 I really, really want you 
 I hope you want me too 
 I'll wait for you 
 Till you come home 
 Here out alone 
 I stay alone for your love 
 For your love, for your love 
 For your love, for your love 
 For your love, for your love
