Tu veux voler 
 Au bord du désir? 
 Je sais que tu me veux 
 Mais est-ce que tu mérites mon amour? 
 Half past an hour in the club 
 I was trying to cut a rug. 
 I was sippin' on, 
 Tryin'a find the missing link. 
 You had a mission tryin'a vogue 
 Then I came right through the smoke, 
 I was smoking hot, 
 Catch my fever, let's burn up the floor. 
 I need to know, how to get into you, 
 Baby, I'm liking your bod. 
 Ooh, you got me stuck, 
 I'm so effin' into you, 
 I'll let you blow my moves cool. 
 Don't breathe, 
 I want to take your breath, 
 Let your body feel it all night, from your battery 
 It can charge you up. 
 Let's start a riot on the floor 
 And wait till you pass out 
 And wait till you pass out 
 And wait till you pass out 
 And wait till you pass out 
 I'm up and up and it's so hard to turn me down 
 Let's burn shit up 'cause I'm your fire starter now 
 I'll bring it back... can you smell that? 
 Now that I'mma rock star, I just wanna stop your heart 
 Go, go... dancer on the dancefloor 
 Go, go... am I what you asked for? 
 I'mma monster, not a pretty little girl 
 Eyes on me, so come follow me 
 Don't breathe 
 I want to take your breath 
 Let your body feel it all night, from your battery 
 It can charge you all up 
 Let's start a riot on the floor 
 And wait till you pass out 
 And wait till you pass out 
 And wait till you pass out 
 And wait till you pass out 
 I just can't say no baby girl I wanna take you down 
 Um no whatever, silly boy I'm tryna turn you out 
 Girl give it up, you know I really want cha 
 Blackin' out, blackin' out right now 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Don't breathe 
 I want to take your breath 
 Let your body feel it all night, from your battery 
 It can charge you all up 
 Let's start a riot on the floor 
 And wait till you pass out 
 And wait till you pass out 
 And wait till you pass out 
 And wait till you pass out
