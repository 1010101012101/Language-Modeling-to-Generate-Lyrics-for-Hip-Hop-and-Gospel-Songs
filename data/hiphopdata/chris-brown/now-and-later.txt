It's like I'm at a candy buffet 
 Gum drops, blow pops, strawberries, and grapes 
 I know 
 You got the flavor 
 Baby and you all in the mix like a cup of Kool Aid 
 Wit a chocolate kiss 
 You put the sugar on my lips 
 I catch a fit, I'm not used to this 
 Can anybody tell me why 
 Shawty got me feelin' high 
 You're my now and later, girl (now and later) 
 Since you're so good to me 
 Like a cherry flavor life saver (my life saver) 
 Please don't ever leave 
 Now and later girl (now and later) 
 My candy girl 
 I get stingy when it comes to you 
 Baby I want you all for myself 
 They don't understand 
 I consider as my first real love 
 Official authentic first sho'nuff 
 From the rough into love 
 Baby you changed me 
 I feel good about you 
 Before the sugar rush I'd never doubt ya 
 I need you dealin' wit me, not without me 
 So baby keep it close to me 
 Call me your now and later, girl (now and later) 
 It feel good to me 
 My life saver 
 Please don't ever leave 
 Now and later (now and later) 
 My candy girl (candy girl) 
 I get stingy when it comes to you 
 Baby I want you all to myself 
 You don't have to worry 
 Baby we got forever 
 To keep it crunk 
 Baby it's a good thing 
 You're right here 
 And I am always cool, with that 
 Candy coated love 
 Breakdown: 
 Put your hands up if you in the spot 
 Let me see your now and later drop 
 Put your hands down playin' around 
 Now I know you wanna now and later drop 
 Put your hands up if you in the spot
