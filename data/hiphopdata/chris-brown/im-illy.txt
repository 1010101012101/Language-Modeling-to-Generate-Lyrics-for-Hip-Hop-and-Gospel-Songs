I'm in the clouds homie, no gas mask 
 Paper long stack higher than giraffe's ass 
 I'm used to driving spaceships, so I'm landing wrong 
 On some ugly shit, ET whatever bandana on 
 Dolce book bag, Louie rag, hanging on the right side 
 Red lightning on my head, I'm looking on the bright side 
 Listen to my music, yes, I highly recommend it 
 But if you ain't messing with it, why the hell are you commenting And I'm really loving rapping now know I had to get it in 
 Listening to rappers and some of them sounding feminine 
 Any stage or any show, I been there or I done it 
 Too big and these girls run from it 
 These young niggas here now and we bout to shut it down 
 My little sister Teyana Taylor and yeah I'm Chris Brown 
 And ain't no goons with me, go on act silly 
 Don't forget modasucer I'm illy
