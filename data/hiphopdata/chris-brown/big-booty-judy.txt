We thinkin' like 36, 24, 40 
 That's about right 
 Judy got a booty from here to there 
 Make a nigga smile from ear to ear 
 Order 3 more bottles of that belvedere 
 Then I point her out like you come here 
 You come here 
 And you come here 
 Booty sittin' higher than a flight of stairs 
 Some can make it clap 
 Some really can't though 
 Them Alabama girls said it's all in the ankles 
 Speakin' of ankles bent over and touch your toes 
 And pop it and make it roll I'm lovin' this angle 
 Hah, I love this view that I'm lookin'at 
 Dress so elegant, ass like the elephant 
 Shorty got me harder than I've ever been 
 So I'mma give it to like a motherfucking veteran 
 Barbie so sick so this dick be the medicine 
 And I know her name 
 She told me but all I heard... 
 Yeah, she make the club go crazy (crazy) 
 And the way she move her body is amazin' (amazin') 
 Yeah, she got me goin' insane 
 And I don't even really know her name 
 MI just call her 
 Big booty Judy (aye) [7x] 
 Big big booty Judy 
 Now, now, now Judy is her name 
 I beat it out of frame 
 She messin' with no bustas' or no suckers 'cause they lame 
 She drop it low and speed it up 
 Other niggas squeezin' up 
 'Cause when they see that ass 
 Tell like "damn what you feedin' up" 
 Her, her, her body so ridiculous 
 I kiss it when she ticklish 
 Big booty world record 
 You can find it up in Guinness 
 And no, no, no it's not a gimmick 
 Shawty she the truth 
 And she got a big donk (big donk) 
 Ayoo 
 Damn girl I'm horny 
 Hangin' out I want it 
 Booty so big I can put ten bottles on it 
 I tell her hold this 
 She got baby makin' hips 
 So I pulled her pants down and gave her lingerie a kiss 
 Miss Parker, Miss Parker 
 When you go let me (oh) 
 Miss Parker 
 She whispered in my ear right now 
 Then me her and her booty all smile 
 Yeah, she make the club go crazy (crazy) 
 And the way she move her body is amazin' (amazin')

 And I don't even really know her name

 Her name is Judy 
 She's a yellow bone 
 Thick chick mega booty 
 Shawty got a donk 
 Booty super pumped 
 And she keep it keep it shakin' 
 Like a base in the trunk 
 Well six fifteens 
 Her swag so mean 
 And I wanna know how she get up in them jeans 
 She gon' be my baby mama 
 She is all me 
 She's a bad bitch 
 Greet her "Hello, Barbie"

 And I don't even really know her name
