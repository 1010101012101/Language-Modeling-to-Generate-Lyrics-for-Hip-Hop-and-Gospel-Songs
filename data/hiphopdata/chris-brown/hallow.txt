Baby I'll admit, I made a mistake 
 Don't know what I was thinking, what I had was so great 
 Tried it to my mind, went back to my heart, 
 I know it ain't there sometimes I want it all 
 Go head cuss me out girl I understand, 
 I will stay right here and take it like a man 
 I really need you back, babe what I gotta do 
 Let me be honest, straight up tell the truth 
 I haven't been the same since I left you, 
 I can't enjoy myself, even if I try too 
 I'm not happy, it ain't a laughin' matter 
 And you don't understand ... 
 My heart is hallow 
 I didn't know I'd end up like this 
 Said I didn't wanna, now I miss you 
 My heart is hallow 
 And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud, 
 Baby Ill scream it out, I didn't know what I was thinking bout 
 Hallow, thought I wanted to spread my wings 
 But I'm empty trying to do my things, out in these streets 
 I wanna fly back 
 (Can I come back) home 
 Without your love its hallow 
 Whoa oh oh ?.. 
 Girl, I will never be the same no more 
 Promise I can do you better, sincerely yours 
 In many times, I didn't even try, and even when I told them lies 
 You stay wonderful girl 
 Can I least just get the chance to show you ah 
 That I'm not a little boy I won't make you cry 
 And it means now, all we need is time 
 We can get back to the way things were 
 I haven't been the same since I left you 
 I can't enjoy myself, even if I try too 
 I'm not happy, it ain't a laughin' matter 
 And you don't understand 
 My heart is hallow 
 I didn't know I'd end up like this 
 Said I didn't wanna, now I miss you 
 My heart is hallow 
 And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud, 
 Baby Ill scream it out, I didn't know what I was thinking bout 
 Hallow, thought I wanted to spread my wings 
 But I'm empty tryin' to do my things, out in these streets 
 I wanna fly back 
 (Can I come back) home 
 Without your love its hallow 
 Only so much I can take, this love is broken down 
 Come rescue me, I need your arms 
 Gently wrapped around 
 Say you need me, and don't let go whoa 
 And just to put it simply, girl my heart is empty 
 My heart is hallow 
 I didn't know I'd end up like this 
 Said I didn't wanna, now I miss you 
 My heart is hallow 
 And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud, 
 Baby Ill scream it out, I didn't know what I was thinking bout 
 Hallow, thought I wanted to spread my wings 
 But I'm empty trying to do my things, out in these streets 
 I wanna fly back 
 (Can I come back) home 
 Without your love its hallow 
 Whoa oh oh ?.. 
 Girl ?..
