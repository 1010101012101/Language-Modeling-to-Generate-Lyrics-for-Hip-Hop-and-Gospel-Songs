Her voice imbedded in my head 
 An embezzle in my heart 
 It's spelling her name, and its telling me 
 Because I can get her in my hands 
 To put her on my arm 
 These expensive things are just wearing me 
 Cause nothing, even matters if my sun shines 
 Trapped in, behind the clouds most of the time 
 I finally see why the guard her soul 
 'Cause she's priceless, 
 But there's something she ought to know, so 
 She got me pickin' up rocks 
 Tossing them at her window 
 Baby come outside 
 I gave it two or three knocks 
 Standing at the front door because I gone run out of rocks 
 (Oh I gotta get up) 
 And let her know she's perfect in ways 
 (She couldn't think of) 
 And I think about her everyday 
 This might not be love, but this crush 
 Got me wanting to tell you today 
 You're a diamond in the rough 
 Dust you off baby, I want to make you shine for me, 
 And if I can take you out, I'll show you off baby, 
 I want the whole world to see. 
 (Because you look so blind) 
 'Cause they same I'm a star 
 (But you can carry your own light) 
 Shed some light on my heart 
 You're a diamond in the rough 
 I want to make you shine for me, 
 Shine for me, shine for me 
 Now this, might be the only time to say it 
 We're finally face to face and baby 
 You're probably scared to be put out on display 
 To be part of a showcase 
 What if I could paint a picture 
 You could be my Mona Lisa 
 Baby you're a work of art 
 And just when I thought I had her 
 Baby girl picked her bag up 
 Told me watch out, then she ran back into the house now 
 She got me pickin' up rocks 
 Tossing them at her window 
 Baby come outside 
 I gave it two or three knocks 
 Standing at the front door because I gone run out of rocks 
 (Oh I gotta get up) 
 And let her know she's perfect in ways 
 (She couldn't think of) 
 And I think about her everyday 
 This might not be love, but this crush 
 Got me wanting to tell you today 
 You're a diamond in the rough 
 Dust you off baby, I want to make you shine for me, 
 And if I can take you out, I'll show you off baby, 
 I want the whole world to see. 
 (Because you look so blind) 
 'Cause they same I'm a star 
 (But you can carry your own light) 
 Shed some light on my heart 
 You're a diamond in the rough 
 I want to make you shine for me, 
 Shine for me, shine for me
