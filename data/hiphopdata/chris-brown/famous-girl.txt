Ye would've said you're so amazing 
 So how could you be so heartless girl 
 Live your life, take T-I-M-E 
 Day and night just like Kid Cudi 
 You'll think of me, you will 
 Drake would say that you're the best he ever had 
 Rumors come and go but you keep his shadow 
 Every where you go it follows 
 Can't understand, I still love you 
 (Watch the blogs talk about this one) 
 Since I thought I found the right woman 
 There were other guys who thought the same thing about her 
 Like damn you let me down, down, down 
 'Cause you're famous girl, for breaking hearts 
 You're famous girl, girl, girl [3x] 
 Should have known you'd break my heart. {That you would break my heart} 
 Keri would've said my love knocks her down 
 Keyshia would've told me I was sent from heaven 
 Sorry B, I don't have no halo 
 You were first to play the game though 
 Sorry I bust the windows out your car 
 I might have cheated in the beginning 
 I was wrong for writing Disturbia 
 But I meant it in Forever 
 We're supposed to be together 
 And I can't let you go 
 Since you thought you found the right man 
 There were other girls who thought the same thing about me 
 Like damn I let you down, down, down 
 Guess I'm famous girl, for breaking hearts 
 I'm famous girl, girl, girl [x3] 
 Didn't know I'd break your heart (That I would break your heart) 
 I'm famous girl, girl, girl [x3] 
 Didn't know I'd break your heart (That I would break your heart) 
 Many hearts we should have left unbroken 
 Empty words are better left unspoken 
 Too much pressure I wish I was frozen 
 Seems we lost our way 
 Now I hope your happy being famous girl 
 You're famous girl, girl, girl [x3] 
 Should have known you'd break my heart. {That you would break my heart} 
 But then again... 
 I'm famous girl, girl, girl [x3] 
 Didn't know I'd break your heart {That I would break your heart}
