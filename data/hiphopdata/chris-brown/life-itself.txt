(instrumental) 
 It kills me to see you cry, 
 Even more when I tell a lie. 
 And it's always something I do 
 To you baby. 
 And I'm so sorry, for all the things 
 That I did. 
 And I can't say goodbye 
 Or let you just walkaway. 
 So I'll admit my wrongs. 
 And I 
 Hope you hear this, 
 Cause this a song I made for you. 
 And I'm hoping maybe, 
 I can win back your heart, 
 So 
 Please don't say goodbye, 
 I know the love still there, 
 Somewhere 
 Wish I could give my world. 
 And I know it hurts sometimes, 
 When 
 You deserve the world, 
 Nothing comes in between us 
 So you can never separate me from your love. 
 Oh darling, 
 I'm never ever letting go 
 'Cause I love you more than life itself. 
 Just want you on my team girl. 
 And I don't give a damn about nothing else. 
 But the way I feel with you 
 Is so amazing (yeah) 
 If I never get to see you, 
 Then I might as well never even open 
 My eyes. 
 I love you so, 
 That I can't 
 Let you go. 
 And I ain't tryna be selfish (no). 
 Just here to tell you 
 That you got my heart 
 And only you can tear it apart. 
 (Yeah, oh) 
 Wish I could give my world. 
 And I know it hurts sometimes, 
 When 
 You deserve the world, 
 Nothing comes in between us 
 So you can never separate me from your love. 
 Oh darling, 
 I'm never ever letting go 
 'Cause I love you more than life itself. 
 I'll make it easy, 
 Easy to love ya. 
 So I ain't gotta look nowhere else, 
 I know I found the right one. 
 Call me crazy, 
 But I love my baby, 
 More than anything. 
 And somethings taking over, 
 Anything you want, I'll hand it over, 
 I'm a ride this thang till the wheels fall off. 
 To the end of time, I'm forever yours, (yours) 
 Wish I could give my world. 
 And I know it hurts sometimes, 
 When 
 You deserve the world, 
 Nothing comes in between us 
 So you can never separate me from your love. 
 Oh darling, 
 I'm never ever letting go 
 'Cause I love you more than life itself. 
 Oh no, I love you 
 More than life itself
