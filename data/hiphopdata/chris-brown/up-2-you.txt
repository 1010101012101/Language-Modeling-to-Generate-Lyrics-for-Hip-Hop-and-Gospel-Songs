What the hell babe, 
 Damn I ain't never felt this way 
 Somebody, somebody tell me 
 I don't have a clue what to do 
 When it comes to you 
 Baby, you're so beautiful 
 Everytime, I see you girl, it throw me off 
 It's so unusual 
 For me, to be waiting 
 But I don't want to blow it girl, 
 But you should know this girl 
 Oh, I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up, 
 'Cause I've been left up in love before, 
 I'ma be the one to take her back see girl 
 We can take our time and you can want to Stay in, go out, 
 Anything you want girl, we can do 
 Girl are we going down, I don't know, 
 But from here now baby I'm gone leave that up to you, 
 Ima leave it up to you
