She says she wanna go around the world 
 She says she wanna be my baby girl 
 She says she wanna see what it feels like 
 To be Ms. Breezy 
 Shopping spree 
 You can have anything 
 And I'ma let her see what it feels like 
 To be Ms. Breezy 
 She love me 
 'Cause I'm so good to her 
 Yeah she love me 
 Spend it all up on her 
 She really love me yeah 
 She can get anything that she wants 
 I know she only used to have it regular 
 Coming in and outta lala on the regular 
 She ain't never had the type of shit I'm giving her 
 Shoes are first Louis purse 
 Hair down never splurge 
 And now I'm blowing her mind, her mind 
 'Cause everyday she roll out in a phantom 
 I know she wanna be mine 
 Wave to the haters like nanananana 
 She says she wanna go around the world 
 She says she wanna be my baby girl 
 She says she wanna see what it feels like 
 To be Ms. Breezy 
 Shopping spree 
 You can have anything 
 And I'ma let her see what it feels like 
 To be Ms. Breezy 
 I know she ain't used to girls staring at her 
 Pointing at her man 'cause I'm trickin' on her yeah 
 And I heard it ain't trickin' if you got it 
 And I got a lot of it so I blow it on her yeah 
 I know that she love me 
 And I'm gon' still buy gifts till she won't turn none of them down 
 But she don't want nothing from me 
 And she gon' change her last name 
 She can't wait to be Mrs. Brown 
 And now I'm blowing her mind, her mind 
 'Cause everyday she roll out in a phantom 
 I know she wanna be mine 
 Wave to the haters like nanananana 
 She says she wanna go around the world 
 She says she wanna be my baby girl 
 She says she wanna see what it feels like 
 To be Ms. Breezy
