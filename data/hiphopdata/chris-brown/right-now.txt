I'm running you a bath 
 Imma have you wet before I get you in the water 
 And we ain't moving fast 
 Ain't gone make it to the bed 
 You gone come before we start up 
 I'm waiting down here 
 'Cause I know you feel it 
 Hell yeah it's going down tonight 
 Baby don't you worry Imma about to go and take it down 
 Kissing on your body, Imma fuck around and turn you out 
 Diamond rings on the floor 
 Making love, cherry lights 
 Can't think of nothing more 
 Making love to you tonight 
 I'll give it to you now, now 
 Right now 
 I'll give it to you now, now 
 Right now 
 Shawty know she bad 
 Licking on them lips got me feeling kind of crazy 
 Arch your back 
 And while I'm rubbing on your hips, I know later you gone thank me 
 But it's okay, it's alright 
 We gone get it all night 
 Don't be scared, girl I don't back 
 Baby don't you worry Imma about to go and take it down 
 Kissing on your body, Imma fuck around and turn you out 
 Diamond rings on the floor 
 Making love, cherry lights 
 Can't think of nothing more 
 Making love to you tonight 
 I'll give it to you now, now 
 Right now 
 I'll give it to you now, now 
 Right now 
 Diamond rings on the floor 
 Making love, cherry lights 
 Can't think of nothing more 
 Making love to you tonight 
 I'll give it to you now, now 
 Right now 
 I'll give it to you now, now 
 Right now 
 Diamond rings on the floor 
 Making love, cherry lights 
 Can't think of nothing more 
 Making love to you tonight 
 I'll give it to you now, now 
 Right now 
 I'll give it to you now, now 
 Right now
