It's a long day 
 Last days, going nowhere 
 I was looking for love 
 Someone I could trust 
 Thought you'd be there 
 Like this, so lonely 
 But what do you care... 
 You're my, only 
 But you weren't there 
 Strength of lies 
 Ocean wide 
 I'm running out of wall, and I 
 I wish that I could look inside your mind 
 I've been waiting for the day 
 When you will realize 
 What we have come along just once in a lifetime
