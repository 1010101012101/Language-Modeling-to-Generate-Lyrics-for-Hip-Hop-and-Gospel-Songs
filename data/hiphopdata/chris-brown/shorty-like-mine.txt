(Feat. Bow Wow) 
 Only thing that keeps me up when I'm feelin' down 
 I don't know about you but I gotta keep mines around 'cause 
 I done looked I done searched and it's hard to find 
 Another shorty like mine

 Never knew it could be so wicked hopin' that you stay wit me 
 Search around the world but you will never find 
 Another shorty like mine, shorty like mine
