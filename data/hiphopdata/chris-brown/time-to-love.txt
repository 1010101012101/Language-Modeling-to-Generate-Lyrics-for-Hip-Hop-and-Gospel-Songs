A material girl 
 In her own world 
 Can't even see the things she's missing 
 Body in the curve 
 A little girl 
 Wanting to grow up 
 And be a star 
 Take a look around 
 Without looking down 
 All these things 
 Have blurred your vision 
 Material Things don't amount to nothing 
 But I know how you feel 
 It's hard to see what's real 
 It takes time 
 Living in a world 
 When you don't know who to trust 
 Next time 
 Slow it down and 
 You'll feel you don't have to rush 
 It'll be fine 
 It takes time 
 It takes time 
 To love 
 And Ima tell the truth 
 When it comes to you 
 My lady 
 And it's a miracle 
 You have found a conscience baby 
 I had plan on leaving 
 You came and gave a reason 
 Now I know the reason why 
 But I know how you feel 
 (You feel) 
 It's hard to see what's real 
 (What's real yeah yeah) 
 It takes time 
 Living in a world when you don't know who to trust 
 Next time 
 (Next time) 
 Slow it down and you'll feel you don't have to rush 
 It'll be fine 
 (It'll be fine) 
 It takes time 
 (Takes time) 
 It takes time 
 (Takes time) 
 To love
