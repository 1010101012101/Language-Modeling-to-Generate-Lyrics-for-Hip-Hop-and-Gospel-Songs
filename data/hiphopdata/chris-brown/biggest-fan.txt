You would think we in a waterbed 
 All the sheets are soaked 
 I'm glad that I ain't gotta work today 
 'Cause last night I did the most 
 Girl, you would think I was inside your head 
 'Cause I know everything you want 
 And no one asked you if you got a man 
 Do I care? I don't 
 That's when we started sexing 
 It's getting loud 
 Got them feeling like they in the clouds 
 Got them screaming like they in the crowd 
 I make 'em scream 
 Baby, baby, baby 
 When you scream, I need 
 To pull your body close and let me sex you, babe 
 Girl, you better not change your mind 
 'Cause girl, we got one night only 
 Once just to love right, baby 
 You're my biggest fan, girl. I want you to holler 
 Two girls I'm watchin' 
 No is not an option 
 I'ma be the captain, of the ship 
 They gon' have my motor rockin' 
 Singing to 'em like Lionel Richie... all night long 
 Getting these bitches... to play in my song 
 We're switching positions 
 And I got the money, so I'm granting they wishes 
 I'll be their sugar daddy 
 It's getting loud 
 Got them feeling like they in the clouds 
 Got them screaming like they in the crowd 
 I make 'em scream 
 When you scream, I need 
 To pull your body close and let me sex you, babe 
 Girl, you better not change your mind 
 'Cause girl, we got one night only 
 Once just to love right, baby 
 You're my biggest fan, girl. I want you to holler 
 Come on, girl, tear it up 
 You can make it clap for me 
 Girl, give it up 
 God damn, you're fine 
 I'm 'bout to stand up. Stand up... 
 I just came here just to make you holler 
 Doing it for hours, even in the shower 
 Over and over again 
 Baby, I'm all up in your garden kissing flowers 
 Are you ready? I'm a take what's mine 
 Get comfortable slow and easy 
 I'm kinda tipsy off this wine 
 So what I say might be a little confusing 
 I got a Magnum in my wallet, I'ma pull it out, I bet that I'll use it 
 I'm gon' make you scream! 
 When you scream, I need 
 To pull your body close and let me sex you, babe 
 Girl, you better not change your mind 
 'Cause girl, we got one night only 
 Once just to love right, baby 
 You're my biggest fan, girl. I want you to holler 
 When you scream, I need 
 To pull your body close and let me sex you, babe 
 Girl, you better not change your mind 
 'Cause girl, we got one night only 
 Once just to love right, baby 
 You're my biggest fan, girl. I want you to holler
