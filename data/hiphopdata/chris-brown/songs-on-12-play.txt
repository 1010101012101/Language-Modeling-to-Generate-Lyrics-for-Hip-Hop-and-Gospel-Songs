You're a goddess in the bedroom 
 Devil in them skin tights 
 Drug that I'm into 
 But it's okay, I'll be alright 
 Try my best to please you 
 Show you what it means to 
 Be a victim of love 
 So turn on that red light (Oh) 
 Uh Huh (Oh) 
 Turn on that red light (Oh) 
 Oh uh huh 
 We gon be bumping and griding 
 Seems like you're ready to sex me, baby 
 And I'm feeling on your body 
 Driving me crazy 
 Half on it baby 
 Cause your body's calling me 
 And with your permission 
 Let me start your ignition 
 Don't you know that 
 You're reminding me 
 Of a song on 12 play 
 You're like a song on 12 play 
 Fuckin' with an R&B thug 
 You gon' have the greatest sex 
 Do you mind if I stroke you up 
 Baby girl, imagine that 
 Dripping that honey love 
 I'mma hit it hard from the back 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh - just like that 
 Do your body like when we freak? (have a little private) 
 Fiesta, fiesta 
 Somebody's girl is on my body 
 Naked, shaking 
 Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera 
 Hey baby 
 We gon be bumping and griding 
 Seems like you're ready to sex me, baby 
 And I'm feeling on your body 
 Driving me crazy 
 Half on it baby 
 Cause your body's calling me 
 And with your permission 
 Let me start your ignition 
 Don't you know that 
 You're reminding me 
 Of a song on 12 play 
 You're like a song on 12 play 
 Ok, foreplay, that's child's play 
 Making love is my forte 
 Shots of you when I'm thirsty 
 Damn right, I'ma eat that pussy 
 Clothes all in the background 
 I give her back shots, I don't back down 
 She likes her hair pulled, that ass slapped around 
 And the neighbors screaming out 
 "Keep it down" 
 Baby turn on the red light tonight 
 Little mama, it'll be alright 
 I just wanna be all on you 
 Do it till we both can't move 
 Your body 
 (Your breast, your ass, girl) 
 Sweat dripping on my body 
 (Do it like this my last girl) 
 So tonight 
 We gon be bumping and griding 
 Seems like you're ready to sex me, baby 
 And I'm feeling on your body 
 Driving me crazy 
 Half on it baby 
 Cause your body's calling me 
 And with your permission 
 Let me start your ignition 
 Don't you know that 
 You're reminding me 
 Of a song on 12 play
