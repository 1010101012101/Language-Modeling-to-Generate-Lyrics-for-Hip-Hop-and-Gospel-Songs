Everytime I go 
 You keep telling me no 
 Your life's traveling fast all around you 
 Whispers of all my past 
 I can tell you anything I want 
 But I'd rather rewrite my wrongs if I'm allowed to 
 So let me know 
 If you can trust me 
 If you can trust me 
 Then trust me 
 If you can trust me baby 
 If you can trust me 
 Then trust me 
 This your moment baby I'm just trying not to miss it 
 You just gotta keep it one hundred with all your bitches 
 Tell 'em that you're fucking with a thug who got a pistol 
 Made a quarter million off of chickens 
 But you know every boy gotta man up 
 And what's the point of fuckin' if we can't love 
 I want her she's mine 
 I know I broke her heart, now I understand her 
 I know that she wanna forgive 
 Willing to be that she'll never forget it 
 All of the people that's all in her head 
 Wish she could make up her mind with decisions 
 Already heard that she fucked with a player 
 Told me she never would fuck with a player 
 Even when I was the nigga in jail 
 One visitation but never no mail 
 Everytime I go 
 You keep telling me no 
 Your life's traveling fast all around you 
 Whispers of all my past 
 I can tell you anything I want 
 But I'd rather rewrite my wrongs if I'm allowed to 
 So let me know 
 If you can trust me 
 If you can trust me 
 Then trust me 
 If you can trust me baby 
 If you can trust me 
 Then trust me
