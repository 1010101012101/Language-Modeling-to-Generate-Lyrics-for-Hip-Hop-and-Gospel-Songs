Running back and forth in my head 
 Tryna figure out how could I let a girl go so perfect 
 Fellas you know what I'm talking about 
 And I've been thinking about it what you said 
 Screaming how you want me out 
 And I turn around and look at your pics 
 And all I think about 
 Is the way we used to kiss 
 Is the way you held my hand 
 Is the way we used to dance, 
 How we show romance 
 Give me one more chance 
 Was it all my fault 
 Sorry for the pain I caused 
 With no love involved 
 Do I cross your mind at all 
 With all the love I gave 
 Don't make me feel this way 
 At anytime of the day 
 Do I cross your mind at all 
 It's a shame that we can't 
 At least talk about our problems 
 My heart's broken 
 And my body is starving for your love 
 And I need you in my life girl for your touch 
 And all I think about is 
 Is the way we used to kiss (I miss kissing baby) 
 Is the way you held my hand 
 Is the way we used to dance, 
 How we show romance 
 Give me one more chance 
 Was it all my fault 
 Sorry for the pain I caused 
 With no love involved 
 Do I cross your mind at all 
 With all the love I gave 
 Don't make me feel this way 
 At anytime of the day 
 Do I cross your mind at all 
 Wait girl, you hear your conscience calling (calling) 
 Wait girl, come back to me I need you here baby 
 Stay girl, baby I want you to stay around for me girl 
 I'm sorry baby 
 Was it all my fault 
 Sorry for the pain I caused 
 With no love involved 
 Do I cross your mind at all 
 With all the love I gave 
 Don't make me feel this way 
 At anytime of the day 
 Do I cross your mind at all 
 At all, at all, at all 
 Do I cross your mind at all (yeah) 
 Girl do I cross your mind at all
