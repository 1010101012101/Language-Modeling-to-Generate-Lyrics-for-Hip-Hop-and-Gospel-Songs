Play on playa 
 Play on playa 
 All my girls it's Friday night 
 And I feel all right 
 Play on playa 
 Play on playa 
 The DJ's playing my favorite song tonight 
 So you gotta dance to it 
 I want you to show off, get that 
 I know you believe in karma 
 Anything you give, you get it right back 
 So baby take a sip, I know you like that 
 We not leaving, this where the party at 
 Even if the police come, fuck that 
 Still throwing up where I'm from 
 We can do it girl 
 Just go, go, go, go, go, go 
 Can you go all in for me just 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go 
 All in when you with me just 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go 
 If you really wanna go to my crib, we can just 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go 
 Go baby, go baby 
 I see you girl 
 Taking shot after shot 
 Sneak a little more for me girl 
 Give me all you got 
 If you need anything 
 If the light is too bright 
 We can turn 'em down, but please turn up 
 For me baby 
 I want you to show off, get that 
 I know you believe in karma 
 Anything you give, you get it right back 
 So baby take a sip, I know you like that 
 We not leaving, this where the party at 
 Even if the police come, fuck that 
 Still throwing up where I'm from 
 We can do it girl 
 Just go, go, go, go, go, go 
 Can you go all in for me just 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go 
 All in when you with me just 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go 
 If you really wanna go to my crib, we can just 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go 
 Go baby, go baby 
 Just go baby 
 Where the weed at? 
 A whole bag of pills, but you don't need that 
 Sit down, girl talk to me 
 I wanna lay you down 
 I know you need a place to relax 
 If I get it, girl your heart's gonna collapse 
 If you don't get it again, you might relapse 
 Baby I ain't playing games tonight 
 Say lady 
 Girl how many licks does it take till I get to the center of the 
 You know baby 
 You know just what I'm talking 'bout 
 But in your favor 
 Baby whatever you say so 
 Please don't turn down right now 
 Girl I'm about to eat it 
 We can do it girl 
 Just go, go, go, go, go, go 
 Can you go all in for me just 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go 
 All in when you with me just 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go 
 If you really wanna go to my crib, we can just 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go 
 Go baby, go baby
