You're a breath of fresh air 
 I need you without you I can't live 
 You're in cahoots with my heart 
 'Cause the way you stole it 
 Gotta be an inside job 
 You're a diamond short of perfect 
 But your body still sparkles 
 I'm on a knee holding your left hand 
 I know where that missing diamond should go-o-o-o-o-o 
 Is there a magical garden where more of you grow-o-o-o-o-o-o 
 I didn't think so 
 Feel like I just won the lotto 
 I've got a one in a million you (ooh..) 
 God made you from the earth and he broke the mould 
 There will never be another you, oh 
 Never be another you, oh 
 Never be another you 
 Now I can spend my whole life 
 Searching for something that's better than my dear 
 But that's a waste of my time 
 'Cause what's better than perfect love 
 Nothing, that's what my point is 
 You can stand in front of a mirror (mirror, no) 
 And there wouldn't be a reflection, no 
 'Cause there's only one of you 
 And that's why I'll never let you go-o-o-o-o 
 Is there a magical garden where more of you grow-o-o-o-o-o-o 
 I didn't think so, no 
 Feel like I just won the lotto 
 I've got a one in a million you (one in a million you..) 
 God made you from the earth and he broke the mould 
 There will never be another you, oh (you... you..) 
 Never be another you, oh (you... oh you..) 
 Never be another you 
 I'm a firm believer in never say never 
 But I can say I never found another you 
 They can say whatever, and it don't even matter 
 'Cause I know our love is true

 Feel like I just won the lotto 
 I've got a one in a million you (youuuu... yeah! oh..) 
 God made you from the earth and he broke the mould 
 There will never be another you, oh (youuuuuuuu-ouuuu) 
 Never be another you, oh (youuuuuu-ouuu) 
 Never be another you 
 Whoa-oa, whoa-oa-oa... 
 Whoa-oa, whoa-oa-oa... 
 Whoa-oa, whoa-oa-oa... 
 Oh... 
 There will never be another you
