Haha, my lil drop top girl 
 (Verse 1: tyga) 
 Sweet lil something, turbo button 
 Four fifty eight, engine running 
 Her legs so sunny, I'm so young money 
 And that base in the trunk got that bxtch bumpin 
 (That's my shxt) 
 Don't skip nothing, play it loud 
 Till the top of the world for me 
 I fear nothing, ride till the cops coming 
 Color coops seats honey, I went from 
 Rags to the wrist, glitter, car 6, rooms 
 And the crib, arcade I did 
 Walk your azz right in girl, leave in a minute 
 Ever had sex on the sand? 
 I guarantee this will be the ride of your life, 
 Round the world, do it all in one night 
 Most them girls, I play 'em but never wife 
 But it's something about you that I like 
 Girl I really love the way you look at me 
 Ain't no other feeling that can drive me crazy 
 To-night girl tonight, it's gonna be the night to take you down 
 Baby, tell me what you doing tonight night night night 
 You can be in my drop top girl 
 Take it all out tonight night night 
 Shawty, don't stop now 
 Tell me what we doing tonight night night 
 We can be in my drop top girl, it's only me and you tonight (take it off) 
 (Verse 2: chris brown) 
 She know she love it, no sheets no covers 
 Give it to her all night, all night loving 
 Go rubbers, unh unh, let me touch it 
 Ain't a new thing to me, unh it's nothing 
 Girl, just say something baby 
 Drop top girls, drive me crazy 
 Shawty know that I got what she need though 
 That's why she all on me for, ha 
 Girl I really love the way you look at me 
 Ain't no other feeling that can drive me crazy 
 To-night girl tonight, it's gonna be the night to take you down 
 Baby, tell me what you doing tonight night night night 
 You can be in my drop top girl 
 Take it all out tonight night night 
 Shawty, don't stop now 
 Tell me what we doing tonight night night 
 We can be in my drop top girl, it's only me and you tonight (take it off)
