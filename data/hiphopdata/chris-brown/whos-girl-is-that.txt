(1st Verse) 
 When I first saw you, 
 I said to myself girl who you lookin' good for, 
 Who you talkin' to, 
 Who that fella is standin right next to you, 
 Ooh ooh look at me silly me, 
 Got me thinkin' bout changin the game, 
 And I can't let you get away, 
 So I said hello hello, 
 Girl what's your name who's girl is that 
 Who's girl is that, 
 'Cause it bout to be the one I'm gettin' at, 
 I wonder who she talkin' to on the phone, 
 I know it's not me so I'm tryna get on, 
 Stop playin' mama come over hurr, 
 You need to go ahead and just throw that number, 
 This love is crazy I want to work somethin' out real quick
