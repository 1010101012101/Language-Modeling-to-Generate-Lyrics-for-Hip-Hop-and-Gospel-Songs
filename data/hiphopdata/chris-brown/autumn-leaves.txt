If you leave this time 
 I feel that you'd be gone for good so 
 I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left 
 Said her father left her young and 
 He said he'll be back with that same 
 Song that you just said you'll stay forever with 
 It seems that all the autumn leaves have fallen 
 I feel like you're the only reason for it 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 It seems that you're the only reason for it 
 I been bleeding in your silence 
 I feel safer in your violence 
 I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left 
 Before I sleep I talk to God 
 He must be mad with me it's coming 
 I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with 
 It seems that all the autumn leaves have fallen 
 I feel like you're the only reason for it 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 So the iceberg never broke 
 And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it 
 And I poke and I poke and I poked at it 
 But it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more, some more 
 And in my notepad, man I wrote and I wrote 
 If I don't have it, if I don't grab it 
 If it don't chip then a toe tag is, one last 
 I'mma hope, I'mma hope so the iceberg don't float 
 If I do manage to do damage to you dammit 
 It'd be grand, it's ten grammies or my granite still standing 
 With a note, a note that read "granted, don't you panic" 
 When you make mistakes the most, the most 
 One day it'll make you grow, you grow 
 When you outlandish and you lose manners 
 To God you shall consult, consult 
 When the bright cameras are still cramming 
 In your face and it provoke, provoke 
 You to act manic, just stay planted 
 Cause you reapin' what you sowed 
 Keep positivity in your heart and 
 Keep a noose from 'round your throat and 
 When you get mad and when you poke at it 
 When you poke it at just know, man 
 The iceberg is a reflection of you when you re-new your vision 
 Just think if it had sunk Titanic, what the fuck would you do to a critic, my nigga? 
 Yeah, yeah, tell me, when doves cry do you hear 'em love? 
 Do you hear 'em love? Do you hear 'em? 
 And if my ship go down tell me who will abort? 
 And they won't let me live even when we mustard the gift 
 When it gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive 
 When they never see good in me 
 Even though I got hood in me 
 Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord 
 It seems that all the autumn leaves have fallen 
 I feel like you're the only reason for it 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do 
 All the things you do
