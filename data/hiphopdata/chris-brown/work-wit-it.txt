Shawty fine, walkin' by, make a nigga look. 
 See the way she toot it up, got a nigga stuck. 
 Zooted and booted up, shuttin down the club. 
 Look at shawty's hip, once she winds it up. 
 Now rewind that back, put it in reverse baby I like that. 
 Can't nobody do it better, let chu do your thing while I sip this amaretto 
 I love the way you wind sloww, oh oh girl, girl when you crawl up on the thing 
 Make it touch the floor, oh oh girl, girl just keep on winding. 
 Girl when you back it up 
 Here a real bad man, wanna see you back it up 
 Wave your hands in the air see ya clap it up come and yo-you work. Aye young girl with the tied up skirt. 
 The way you move ya body make me wanna hit it, 
 I know you classy but you can still act a hoe wit it, 
 It ain't no question 'bout it, shawty you can get it, 
 The only question is, Can you work with it? Can you work with it? Can you work with it? Can you work with it? Can you work with it? Can you twirk with it? Can you work with it? Can you work with it? uh huh 
 Throw it back at me, ima make a home run,

 Make it touch the floor, oh oh girl, girl just keep on winding.
