Sweet like honey dew 
 I like when you come around 
 It's just me, and you 
 Girl, and you 
 Her fragrance turns me on 
 Her skin so soft oh 
 I just wanna hold ya 
 All night and day 
 And we got all the time girl 
 So come a little closer 
 I just wanna hold ya 
 All night and day 
 I'm thinking 'bout you all day, all night 
 I'm holding on tight, baby I just can't let you go 
 I get lost in ya love 
 I get wrapped in the words you say 
 I get lost in that love we make 
 I even fall hard for the games you play 
 Lost in ya love 
 I get wrapped in the words you say 
 I get lost in that love we make 
 I even fall hard for the games you play 
 Baby you're the truth 
 I wanna talk about your loving 
 I'm so connected to you 
 I want it all 
 I need it all, from ya 
 You're my only one and you know that 
 I hold it down 'cause I own that 
 Too much history, we go way back 
 It's so personal and we got that 
 Her fragrance turns me on 
 Her skin so soft oh 
 I just wanna hold ya 
 All night and day 
 And we got all the time girl 
 So come a little closer 
 I just wanna hold ya 
 All night and day 
 I'm thinking 'bout you all day, all night 
 I'm holding on tight, baby I just can't let you go 
 I get lost in ya love 
 I get wrapped in the words you say 
 I get lost in that love we make 
 I even fall hard for the games you play 
 Lost in ya love 
 I get wrapped in the words you say 
 I get lost in that love we make 
 I even fall hard for the games you play 
 Run it back, run it back, run it back 
 Oh, this my favorite song 
 And shoutout to the DJ 
 'Cause he gon play this record all night long 
 Her fragrance turns me on 
 Her skin so soft oh 
 I just wanna hold ya 
 All night and day 
 And we got all the time girl 
 So come a little closer 
 I just wanna hold ya 
 All night and day 
 I'm thinking 'bout you all day, all night 
 I'm holding on tight, baby I just can't let you go 
 I get lost in ya love
