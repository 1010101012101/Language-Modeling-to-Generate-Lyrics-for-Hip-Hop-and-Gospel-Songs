(Chris Brown Chorus) 
 Shawty, 
 I ain't never ever met a freak like you, no shawty 
 Somethin' like an addict for the things you do 
 (You do, oh) 
 (Oh-ah) Look at you, 
 (Oh-ah) Drive me crazy, 
 (Oh-ah) Things you do 
 (Yeah yeah) 
 (Oh-ah) I want you 
 (Oh-ah) To be my lady 
 (Oh-ah) Be with you 
 (Eh) 
 (Tyga Verse) 
 Uh, 
 Trench coat, 
 Black thighs, 
 Hammer back, 
 Shoot it in the sky, 
 I live by you my bra', load you up it's hammer time, 
 Hell yeah I'ma handle mine, 
 But that's just just just for one night, 
 I'ma love you right, 
 You protect my life, 
 Niggas try to play you, 
 But they gon' pay the price, 
 A-Alf alfa on these hoes standing up at all times 
 No lie, just remember you forever mine
