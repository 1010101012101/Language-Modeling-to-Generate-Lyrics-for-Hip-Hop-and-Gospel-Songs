You got my heart one and only 
 You got my trust and baby I'll never let you down 
 You're the one I need right now 
 And your body is like wow 
 And everything just 
 And everything just 
 And everything just revolves around you 
 Eh, come baby tell me girl what's up 
 You already know me girl what's up 
 Ain't nobody here baby it's just us 
 And I'm just in, understand 
 Girl I hope ready for the backseat 
 I went and got a taxi driver 
 I'll go any 
 Girl I'll go every 
 I'll go anywhere with you 
 Hey little love of mine 
 Can you spend a little more time 
 With me baby 
 I'm sure it'll be just fine 
 I'm not scared to love you 
 I don't care if your heals was made to walk in 
 Girl gon' and take 'em off 
 I just wanna see you shake it 
 Shorty little scared 
 She said I don't need to break it off 
 So baby tell me 
 Just what you wanna do now 
 'Cause I'll do any baby

 I'll do anything with you 
 Hey little love of mine 
 Can you spend a little more time 
 With me baby 
 I'm sure it'll be just fine 
 I'm not scared to love you
