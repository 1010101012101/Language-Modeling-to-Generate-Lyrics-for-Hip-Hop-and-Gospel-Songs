Yes sometimes I was the one 
 Yeah I was the one running 'round acting wild 
 And sometimes you was the one 
 Turning up with your girls only sometimes 
 Now my heart's stuck in the middle 
 I will admit 
 Made my mistakes 
 But I love my kid, oh 
 My wrongs got a list a mile long, yeah 
 Now you wish I was the one 
 Wish I was the one who couldn't sleep now 
 Wish I was the one who couldn't eat now 
 Wish I was the wouldn't who couldn't breathe without 
 You're the one 
 I'm the who's supposed to be broken 
 Break me down and build me up 
 Wish that I could meet you half way 
 But I don't have the heart 
 Don't have the heart 
 You say you wanted love 
 Gave you that and more 
 Yeah, but when it came to trust 
 We both fucked up 
 Talkin' bout I saw you with your side hoe 
 I was looking for someone to ride for 
 The ring and the promise I gave you was only a milestone 
 Now we both waking up looking for missed calls and dial tones 
 And I'm sick of dreaming about ya 
 Now you sick of seeing my daughter 
 Her eyes look like mine 
 Now I'm forced to pick sides, yeah 
 Now you wish I was the one 
 Wish I was the one who couldn't sleep babe 
 Wish I was the one who couldn't eat babe 
 Wish I was the wouldn't who couldn't breathe without 
 You're the one and now baby 
 I'm the who's supposed to be broken 
 Break me down and build me up 
 Wish that I could meet you half way 
 But I don't have the heart 
 Don't have the heart 
 You were supposed to have the first pick 
 And I don't go to church like you wish I did 
 I put us in this predicament 
 I wish you could believe me 
 Crying ain't easy 
 Trust me baby I need you to hold me 
 I miss my friend 
 Netflix and chill at the crib 
 Mind, body and soul you my rib 
 Why you wish I was the one 
 Wish I was the one who couldn't sleep 
 Wish I was the one who couldn't eat 
 Wish I was the wouldn't who couldn't breathe without 
 You're the one and now you 
 I'm the who's supposed to be broken 
 You're the one who break me down and build me up 
 Wish that I could meet you half way 
 But I don't have the heart 
 I don't have the heart
