What you lookin' for, baby? 
 I know why you want love in the middle of the night 
 Don't be lookin' all scary 
 When you've been lookin' for this for a long, long time 
 Come on over here, baby 
 You can love me in the dark, you can love me in the light 
 Your friends lookin' all crazy 
 'Cause you're goin' home with me and they left behind 
 They can come too, baby 
 What's yours is mine as long as they're fine 
 [Incomprehensible] can't help it, baby 
 Tell them one night the time and they all ask why 
 Me love, me love me 
 Me love, me love, me love, me love the girls 
 (Keep lookin' for the real ones) 
 Me love, me love me 
 Me love, me love, me love, me love the girls 
 (Keep lookin' for the real ones) 
 Me love, me love me 
 Me love, me love, me love, me love the girls 
 (Keep lookin' for the real ones) 
 Me love, me love me 
 Me love, me love, me love, me love the girls 
 You can call me your daddy 
 I'll be your lover, whatever you like 
 Yeah, let me look at it 
 Don't you mack me, I've to ask twice 
 'Cause I'm up in your city 
 And I'm only in town for one more night 
 You ain't the only one here, baby 
 So many girls in line goin' crazy outside 
 So let's go 
 Me love, me love me 
 Me love, me love, me love, me love the girls 
 (Keep lookin' for the real ones) 
 Me love, me love me 
 Me love, me love, me love, me love the girls 
 (Keep lookin' for the real ones) 
 Me love, me love me 
 Me love, me love, me love, me love the girls 
 (Keep lookin' for the real ones) 
 Me love, me love me 
 Me love, me love, me love, me love the girls 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 And we can do whatever you tell me, you smell me? 
 John V cologne, [Incomprehensible] 
 But when I'm home, I'm Rambo, Sylvester Stallone 
 And she know that, picture us like Kodak 
 Red wine's red wine, listen to Bobby Real Mac 
 And this a throwback, me NCB, tell them to hold back 
 And if you see it couple dime, show them where to roll that 
 Me love, me love me 
 Me love, me love, me love, me love the girls 
 (Keep lookin' for the real ones) 
 Me love, me love me 
 Me love, me love, me love, me love the girls 
 (Keep lookin' for the real ones) 
 Me love, me love me 
 Me love, me love, me love, me love the girls 
 (Keep lookin' for the real ones) 
 Me love, me love me 
 Me love, me love, me love, me love the girls 
 You love me, girl 
 Do you love me, girl? 
 I said you love me, girl 
 And I love you, girl
