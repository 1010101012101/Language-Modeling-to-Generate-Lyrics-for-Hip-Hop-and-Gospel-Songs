She's like a diamond in the rub 
 She's my passion 
 So been over the brightest star and main attraction 
 Only she motivates my heart 
 To be like a swazin 
 So I put her up on the baddest star 
 Up on the ...like a basement 
 But I wonder if she know this me 
 Back as I see her 
 I really I promise I will make you a believer tonight 
 ...Seduction to your seduction 
 I promise you'll be all right 
 Yeah you are 
 And treating me like I'm see through 
 Like I'm see through 
 My heart breaks like a million ... 
 Girl you are 
 And treating me like I'm see through 
 Just like I'm see through 
 Like desire ...on your heart I see... 
 And I just wanna cool you down 
 Baby to see me ... 
 I think that she's looking right now 
 Baby all I wanna do is save you 
 And if is the dream don't wanna wake up 
 Come here, come here 
 Can you hear me, can you see me 
 Right there 
 Back as I see her 
 I really I promise I will make you a believer tonight 
 ...Seduction to your seduction 
 I promise you'll be all right 
 Yeah you are 
 And treating me like I'm see through 
 Like I'm see through 
 My heart breaks like a million ... 
 Girl you are 
 And treating me like I'm see through 
 Just like I'm see through 
 What I gotta for you to notice me 
 I'm breezy and nobody calling me 
 With all the size... post to free 
 Better put the fur on the ... 
 Yeah eia she play hot 
 Worship for she play dot 
 Fresh cut I'm a king come and see zot 
 With the ... I could've pick her 
 But a nigga really wanted you 
 Only have one first 
 But fuck it out I don't need the curse I got a feel 
 Some bang the vills only ...is me and you 
 ...You can see the pull I should see through 
 Yeah you are 
 And treating me like I'm see through 
 Like I'm see through 
 My heart breaks like a million ... 
 Girl you are 
 And treating me like I'm see through 
 Just like I'm see through
