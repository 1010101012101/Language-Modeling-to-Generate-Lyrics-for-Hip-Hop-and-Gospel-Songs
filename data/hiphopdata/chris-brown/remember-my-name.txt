I need your touch, 
 But your hands are locked away 
 I hear your voice, 
 You've got nothing left to say 
 I'll take this lock 
 Off my heart 
 I'll take this bullet, 
 I'll take it for love 
 So if the lights in the sky come crashing down 
 I still can find your love even in the crowd 
 But will you remember me 
 Will you remember my name, 
 Remember my name, 
 Will you remember my name 
 Remember my 
 Name 
 (I love you, I love you, love you) 
 Remember my 
 Name 
 (I love you, I love you, love you) 
 Remember my 
 (I love you, I love you, love you) 
 Remember my 
 Name 
 I need my kiss, 
 But your lips are far away 
 So I have no choice, 
 So I guess I'll 
 Have to steal your love away 
 And I'll take this scar 
 From my heart, 
 Bang bang, 
 I take this bullet, 
 Bang bang 
 I'll take it for love 
 Bang bang, 
 I'll take it for love, 
 Bang bang, 
 I'll take it for us 
 Will you remember my name, 
 Remember my name, 
 Will you remember my name 
 Remember my 
 Name 
 (I love you, I love you, love you) 
 Remember my 
 (I love you, I love you, love you) 
 Remember my 
 (I love you, I love you, love you) 
 Name 
 Remember my 
 Name 
 Floating above the clouds and sky 
 Wishing upon the falling star 
 Hoping my love hasn't forgot my name 
 It's automatic distraction 
 This love is so strong 
 Too birds of a feather baby 
 Wishin we can float off 
 We can fly, 
 Higher babe, 
 Higher babe, higher babe, 
 Higher babe, higher babe, 
 Just fly high 
 Higher babe, higher babe, 
 Higher babe, higher babe, 
 All gas no breaks 
 I just wanna levitate 
 All gas no breaks, 
 I just wanna levitate 
 All gas no breaks 
 I just wanna levitate 
 Just wanna levitate, 
 I just wanna levitate 
 Will you remember my name, 
 Remember my name, 
 Will you remember my name, 
 Remember my 
 Name, 
 Remember my 
 Remember my 
 Name, 
 Remember my 
 Remember my
