 Living life for all these beautiful women, yeah

 Champagne gon get you right

 I just need the green light 
 Baby let me set your body free 
 Sun up, till sun down 
 Kissing you, you kissing me

 Let's runaway tonight, together 
 Forever baby 
 End the night

 Fine my love 
 In the light, it won't go away 
 The rays are on you now 
 I bet ain't nobody ever did you better 
 Moving at the speed of sound

 Diving deep, girl I'm going down
