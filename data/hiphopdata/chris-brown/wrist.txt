 Wrist, drip, wrist, dip 
 Wrist, drip, wrist, drippin' and drippin' 
 Wrist skrr, skrr tip, four tip, wrist 
 Drippin', drippin', drippin', drippin', drippin', drippin', drippin, drippin' 
 Solo Lucci 
 My wrist 'bout 30 below, why would I be worried 'bout hoes? 
 And if you ain't ever leaning, swerving in traffic, you ain't sip that dirty before 
 Catch me tipping on 4's, diamond drippin', prolly sippin' on 4's 
 Ferragamo slippers dipped 'em in gold with so many women, think I'm pimpin' on hoes 
 Chris Brown 
 Cause my wrist still drippin', 44's still tip 
 In the cut with my hittas, no they do not miss 
 I'm a champagne pourin' nigga, I love big asses and tits (Show me them tities) 
 And if you're here just to witness, I just promise this 
 Hold my wrist, tip, four, tip 
 Wrist, drip, 44's tip 
 On my wrist, tip, four tip 
 Wrist drip, 44's tip 
 No he not ballin' like us, who the fuck he think he is? 
 You gotta come to my city, you gotta see how we live (Pull up with the drug dealers) 
 You should just come on the bed, I should just fuck you right now 
 Oh just forget what I said, I just be thinking out loud 
 Thinking out loud, thinking out loud 
 Can I hit in the mirror? Yeah, I wanna see your body clearer 
 Let's think out loud, think out loud 
 Got my wrist doin' 85 in a 35, 35, 35 
 Wrist, tip, four, tip 
 Wrist, drip, 44's tip 
 On my wrist, tip, four tip 
 Wrist drip, 44's tip

 My wrist 30 below, it cost about 40 
 Get 50 on me, my neck is retarded 
 But nigga I don't get it, my bitch is a baller 
 But she from the streets so don't get us started 
 Handcuffs like I got arrested homie 
 Ferragamo's on me, got me flexin' on 'em 
 Mud, mud, I got all these taxes on me 
 Diamonds shining that's for VVS' only 
 Leanin' off Activis, tippin' on four, thinkin' 'bout winter how you just sleep on it like mattresses 
 But that's how it go, I'm gettin' that dough and I'm 'bout to count up like it's calculus 
 I got my name out that trappin' shit but I got the fame out this rappin' shit 
 Now my watch and my chain is immaculate
