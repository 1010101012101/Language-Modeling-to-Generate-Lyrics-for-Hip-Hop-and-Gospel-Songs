 What it is folk 
 This right here is that 16 year old phenom 
 Chris Breeezy 
 Me myself I'm the 23 year old ceo 
 Who? 
 Young carter harder than them other boys 
 I ain't even fucking baby 
 I could take a summer off 
 I could break a women off 
 I could take her stomach off 
 One of my trucks now I'm ridin' in the good 
 Line it all up garunteed you'll get served 
 Lil Chris here said run it so I run it to her 
 I'm that cash money youngin birdman jr 
 Just a president lookin' for a monicur (chris) 
 The young boi just turned 16 and I got 6 4s and hot bikes that I rock 
 Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock 
 But all the swangin in they bikinis just might convince em' 
 Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop 
 'Cause you speak and that's slang that I talk 
 That sassy tempo with that walk 
 May be the reason that all these teenagers may never seen me 
 Mama you may be 3 years older but you hot

 Gimme That

 Just my frame and age 
 Got you thinkin' that I'm just too young to turn your page

 A lil patrome, a lil hen, I'm on cavalee vodka

 You could leave your birthday suit on

 Never know what you want

 Never know who home 
 Learned it from a biggie song 
 On to a new one 
 Something like a red bone

 And I told her get here girl and don't you stunt now give me that funk that gushy stuff 
 Oh
