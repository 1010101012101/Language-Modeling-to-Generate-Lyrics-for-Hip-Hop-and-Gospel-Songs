I don't think that passenger seat 
 Has ever looked this good to me 
 He tells me about his night 
 And I count the colors in his eyes 
 He'll never fall in love he swears 
 As he runs his fingers through his hair 
 And I'm laughin' 'cause I hope he's wrong 
 And I don't think it ever crossed his mind 
 He tells a joke and I fake a smile 
 That I know all his favorite songs 
 And I could tell you, 
 His favorite color's green 
 He loves to argue 
 Born on the 17th 
 His sister's beautiful 
 He has his father's eyes 
 And if you ask me if I love him 
 I'd lie. 
 He looks around the room 
 Innocently over looks the truth 
 Shouldn't a light go on? 
 Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long? 
 He sees everything black and white 
 Never let nobody see him cry. 
 I don't let nobody see me wishin' he was mine. 
 I could tell you, 
 His favorite color's green 
 He loves to argue 
 Born on the 17th 
 His sister's beautiful 
 He has his father's eyes 
 And if you ask me if I love him 
 I'd lie. 
 He stands there then walks away. 
 My God if I could only say 
 "I'm holdin' every breath for you" 
 He'd never tell you, 
 But he can play guitar. 
 I think he can see right through 
 Everythin' but my heart 
 First thought when I wake up is 
 "My God he's beautiful" 
 So I Put on my make-up 
 And pray for a miracle. 
 Yes I could tell you' 
 His favorite color's green 
 He loves to argue oh, and it kills me 
 Born on the 17th 
 His sister's beautiful 
 He has his father's eyes 
 And if you ask me if I love him 
 If you ask me if I love him 
 I'd lie.
