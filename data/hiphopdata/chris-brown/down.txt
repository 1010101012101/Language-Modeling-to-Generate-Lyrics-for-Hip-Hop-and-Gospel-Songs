 Kanye: 
 Mr.West is in the building, 
 Children, ladies 
 Call the shrink up, they about to go crazy. 
 Hold ya drinks up like you was celebratin' 
 Hold ya guns if they is hella hatin' 
 I'm so clean and them, they got rabbies 
 I can see it through my lense of my ray b 
 As way fierce, um hum. 
 Ye, do you play fair?

 Snap the Nikon at the icon with Nikes on 
 I heard you do it with the lights on 
 But I really make babies when the mikes on 
 Check out all my kids

 I am so retarted with the spit like a retarted kid that spits 
 Oops I ain't mean to say that

 "These chicks is dangerous 
 You need a girl that's A-list 
 Not one that just barley made it on a list" 
 Cause from Wall to Wall we got it Poppin' right now 
 There's a hundred girls tryin' get down, down, down
