David Banner: 
 Lord we come to you 
 Asking for the strength 
 And the guidance 
 To be man enough 
 To protect our children 
 Till the day that we die 
 Amen 
 Devotion to that higher ground 
 Each day by day hes slowly fading 
 It's like we can't hear the sound 
 So I gotta be innovated 
 He sending all over the world now 
 We need to start makin' changes 
 The light is covered up by the clouds 
 And my lifes constantly raining 
 But when I think about the things 
 You've done for me 
 And how you made me see, truthfully 
 I ain't gon do you wrong no 
 Don't let no one of us go 
 Because I know 
 Nobodys gonna save me (save me) 
 Gonna save me (save me) 
 From the sins I've done (sins I've done) 
 Nobodys gonna save me (save me) 
 Gonna save me (save me) 
 'Cause it's all my fault (it's all my fault) 
 Nobodys gonna save me (save me) 
 Gonna save me (save me) 
 From the belief I've lost 
 Nobodys gonna save me (save me) 
 Gonna save me (gonna save me) 
 So I'm prayin' to you God (prayin' to you God) 
 It's not safe to say it's over now 
 We're here and I see 
 Little bodies laying on the ground 
 It coulda been your baby 
 Is someone gonna help us out 
 They need some food to eat 
 But there'll be brighter days 
 When we'll be saved 
 The Lord will send blessings 
 But when I think about the 
 Things you've done for me 
 And how you made me see, truthfully 
 I ain't gon do you wrong no 
 Don't let no one of us go 
 Because I know 
 Nobodys gonna save me (gonna save me) 
 Gonna save me (gonna save me) 
 From the sins I've done (done) 
 Nobodys gonna save me (nobodys gonna save me) 
 Gonna save me (yeah) 
 'Cause it's all my fault (fault) 
 Nobodys gonna save me (save me) 
 Gonna save me (save me) 
 From the belief I've lost (ooh) 
 Nobodys gonna save me (save me) 
 Gonna save me (save me) 
 So I'm prayin' to you God (prayin' to you God) 
 David Banner: 
 Every step that we take from this day on lord 
 We both hope that it's one in your direction (save me) 
 So take this song (save me) 
 As a token of our affection (ooh) 
 We both apolgize, and love (save me)
