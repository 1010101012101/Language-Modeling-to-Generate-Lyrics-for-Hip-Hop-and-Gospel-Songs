I don't wanna go there 
 We should never go there 
 Why you wanna go there 
 I guess I gotta go there 
 You're hearing rumors about me 
 And you can't stomach the thought 
 Of someone touching my body 
 When you so close to my heart 
 I won't deny what they saying 
 Because most of it is true 
 But it was all before I fell for you 
 So please babe 
 So please don't judge me 
 And I won't judge you 
 'Cause it could get ugly 
 Before it gets beautiful 
 Please don't judge me 
 And I won't judge you 
 And if you love me 
 Then let it be beautiful 
 Let it be beautifu-u-ul, let it be beautiful 
 Let it be beautifu-u-ul, let it be beautiful 
 Everything I say right now 
 Is gonna be use in another fight 
 And I've been through this so many times 
 Can we change the subject? 
 You gonna start asking me questions like: 
 "Was she attractive? Was she an actress?" 
 Baby the fact is 
 You're hearing rumors about me 
 And saw some pictures online 
 Saying things, got you so angry 
 Making you wish you were mine 
 Before we start talking crazy 
 Saying some things we'll regret 
 Can we just slow it down and press reset? 
 So please babe 
 So please don't judge me 
 And I won't judge you 
 'Cause it could get ugly 
 Before it gets beautiful 
 Please don't judge me 
 And I won't judge you 
 And if you love me 
 Then let it be beautiful 
 Just left the past 
 Just be the past 
 And focused on things 
 That are gonna make us laugh 
 Take me as I am, love who I was 
 I'll promise I'll be, the one that you can trust 
 So please babe 
 So please don't judge me 
 And I won't judge you 
 'Cause it could get ugly 
 Before it gets beautiful 
 Please don't judge me 
 And I won't judge you 
 And if you love me 
 Then let it be beautiful 
 Let it be beautiful 
 Let it be beautiful 
 Let it be beautiful 
 Let it be beautiful 
 Let it be beautiful, ay 
 Let it be beautiful, yeah 
 Let it be beautiful, yeah 
 Let it be beautiful, yeah 
 I don't wanna go there baby yeah 
 We should never go there
