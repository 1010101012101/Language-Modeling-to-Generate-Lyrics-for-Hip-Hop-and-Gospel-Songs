Oh oh 
 Oh oh... 
 You said I'm not giving enough 
 But baby girl I'm trying so hard to... keep up, 
 When you fear that Imma always leave you lonely 
 But you see that I want us to last forever 
 And my heart stays open 
 Darling you know It will get better 
 But you know that shit wont happen over night 
 We just gotta give love a try 
 And when you look beside you girl I'll be there... 
 When It rains down your face 
 Tell me where do the tears end up 
 Don't wanna drown In the rivers of your sorrow 
 And I, I will swimn a thousand miles 
 Just for one minute to see you smile 
 So I'm treading water, I'm treading water 
 Please don't cry cause your drowning me 
 ** 
 Oh oh 
 Oh oh... 
 What do you say 
 What to do you mean 
 That you blame me 
 Why Is It today, that you doubted me 
 That Imma always leave you lonely 
 But you'll see that I want us to last forever 
 And my heart stays open 
 Darling you know It will get better 
 But you know that shit wont happen over night 
 We just gotta give love a try 
 And when you look beside you girl I'll be there... 
 When It rains down your face 
 Tell me where do the tears end up 
 Don't wanna drown in the rivers of your sorrow 
 And I, I will swimn a thousand miles 
 Just for one minute to see you smile 
 So I'm treading water, I'm treading water 
 Please don't cry cause your drowning me 
 Oh oh 
 Oh oh...
