The memories we shared 
 Could last a man a lifetime 
 It's like truth or dare, 
 When you're there. 
 And I'll admit that I'm scared 
 To lose you to another guy-uy-uy 
 But it's up to you to decide 
 Who to love. 
 Tonight I'm a break my promise, 
 I know I said 
 I'll set you free 
 But baby you told me to be honest, 
 Girl I need you here with me 
 So we can do it again 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 A whole life time 
 Would not be enough 
 'Cause I wanna love you baby 
 Over and over 
 And girl each time I 
 See you shed a tear 
 I wanna wipe 'em all up 
 With my kisses 
 And make you smile from ear to ear. 
 Tonight I'm a break my promise, 
 I know I said 
 I'll set you free 
 But baby you told me to be honest, 
 Girl I need you here with me 
 So we can do it again 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Girl what are you running from? 
 I'm willing just to give you everything you want 
 Girl you are always number one, 
 I'm saying 'cause I know you're more than wonderful 
 And my heart and your heart are as one, 
 And this love will never change 
 You 
 And me forever 
 Whoa oh 
 Whoa oh 
 Whoa oh 
 Whoa oh 
 Whoa oh 
 Whoa oh 
 So we can do it again 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Do it again 
 Whoa oh 
 Whoa oh 
 Whoa oh 
 Whoa oh 
 Whoa oh 
 Whoa oh
