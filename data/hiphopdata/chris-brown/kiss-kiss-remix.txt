I got the hotness 
 That everybody wants in a girl 
 They just want a kiss kiss OH 
 But they just can't get with that girl 
 I'm a country boy from Tappahanock 
 Va is where I reside so shawty understand it 
 And I know I just turn 18 
 And I get a little mannish 
 And you see this bandanna hanging 
 That means I'm like a bandit (li-like a bandit, bandit) 
 If you wit it girl 
 Get it poppin' 
 Roll wit me 
 Ain't no stopping 
 So get it shawty 
 We parking lot pimping in my dome 
 I know want you want 
 I got the hotness 
 That everybody wants in a girl 
 They just want a kiss kiss OH 
 But they just can't get with that girl
