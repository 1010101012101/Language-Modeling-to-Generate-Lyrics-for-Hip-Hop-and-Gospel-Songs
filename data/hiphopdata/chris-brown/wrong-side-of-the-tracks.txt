Only 15 minutes till ya momma comes home from work and I know 
 That she wouldn't be tickled pink to find me hurr (yeah) 
 Cause even though we was just chillin' and a little flirtin she don't 
 Even want me anywhere near her baby girl (oh no) 
 So I think I better leave 
 Grab my coat hat and timbo's 
 And bounce through the window 
 Cause the last song on the CD was skippin 
 And I don't want ya folks catchin me, you trippin' 
 'Cause she don't think 
 We're old enough to fall in love (in love) 
 'Cause she swears that I'm from the wrong side of the tracks 
 (But she don't even see) 
 She don't see there's more to me than just a thug 
 (That I ain't no thug) 
 There's nothing you can do when opposites attract 
 And it's like that 
 All my ladies in the house tonight 
 Say ooh... (yeah) 
 Now if y'all wanna fall in love with chris say 
 Ooh... 
 All my ladies in the house say ooh... 
 (Aww yeah that sounds so good) 
 Now say whoa... (ooh) 
 'Cause she don't think 
 We're old enough to fall in love (in love) 
 'Cause she swears that I'm from the wrong side of the tracks 
 (But she don't even see) 
 She don't see there's more to me than just a thug 
 (That I ain't no thug) 
 There's nothing you can do when opposites attract 
 And it's like that
