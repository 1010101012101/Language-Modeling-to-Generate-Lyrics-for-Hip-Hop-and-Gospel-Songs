Only 15 minutes till ya momma come home from work 
 And I know 
 That she wouldn't be tickle pink to find me here (yeah) 
 Cause even tho we was just chillin' 
 And a little flow she don't 
 Even want me anywhere near her baby girl (oh no) 
 So I think I better leave 
 Grab my coat hat and timbos 
 And bounce through the window 
 Cause the last song on the CD is skippin 
 And I don't want ya folks catchin me a crippin 
 'Cause she don't think 
 We're old enough to fall in love (in love) 
 'Cause she swears that I'm from the wrong side of the tracks 
 (But she don't even see) 
 She don't see there's more to me than just a thug 
 (That I ain't a thug) 
 There's nothing you can do when opposites attract 
 And it's like that 
 All my ladies in the house tonight 
 Say ooh... (yeah) 
 Now if y'all wanna fall in love with chris say 
 Ooh... 
 All my ladies in the house say ooh... 
 Aww yeah that sound so good 
 Now say whoa... 
 She don't think 
 We're old enough to fall in love (in love) 
 'Cause she swears that I'm from the wrong side of the tracks 
 (She don't see how much I love you) 
 She don't see there's more to me than just a thug 
 There's nothing you can do when opposites attract 
 And it's like that
