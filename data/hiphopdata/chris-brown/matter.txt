I've written so many letters 
 I tried to email ya 
 All I ask is why 
 You dodging me 
 And he's not any better 
 I can do you better 
 Than he can 
 I see the way you are with me, I know that you ain't satisfied 
 But it's like you don't even remember 
 It's like I don't even matter 
 On your birthday 
 For the holidays 
 Got me going crazy 
 You're on my mind 
 It's like I don't even matter 
 Love is gone 
 Girl you're done with me 
 Can you think about us? 
 I miss you so much 
 It's like I don't even matter 
 I miss the smell of your perfume 
 I lay by the fireplace 
 I guess tonight is the night I miss your touch 
 Baby I need you 
 The only love I have in my heart is for you 
 Can't even live 
 Can't even live with the pain I feel inside 
 This is real 
 Why you giving that up? 
 Can you see me 
 Am I invisible? 
 I see the way you are with me, I know that you ain't satisfied 
 But it's like you don't even remember 
 It's like I don't even matter 
 On your birthday 
 For the holidays 
 Got me going crazy 
 You're on my mind 
 It's like I don't even matter 
 Love is gone 
 Girl you're done with me 
 Can you think about us? 
 I miss you so much 
 It's like I don't even matter 
 And I see you don't get my love is so unconditional 
 Back and forth, in and out with us 
 Girl I want you, yeah 
 And nobody else 
 If I can't have you Imma break down 
 It's like I don't even matter 
 On your birthday 
 For the holidays 
 Got me going crazy 
 You're on my mind 
 It's like I don't even matter 
 Love is gone 
 Girl you're done with me 
 Can you think about us? 
 I miss you so much 
 It's like I don't even matter
