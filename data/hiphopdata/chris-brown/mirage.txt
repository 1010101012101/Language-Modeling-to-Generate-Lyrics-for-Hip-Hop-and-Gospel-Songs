Eyes must be wiser 
 Look I got you up and closing the blinds cause 
 Just in case you need a friendly reminder 
 Let me take this bullet bullet out right here 
 Change you by I need adviser 
 Hard to beat but fuck it I don't need a driver 
 All me want is a girl to be a rider 
 Can't believe she pull it, pull it 
 Nigga gun gun pow 
 But she want me hold her, hold her down 
 Sorry boo boo you guess no love, no love nah 
 Must be coo koo got me fucked up, fucked up wow 
 (You got 'em fucked up) 
 You know a nigga ain't gonna hold ya, hold ya down 
 I'm a mirage, what? fuck I look like 
 I'm a mirage, what the fuck I look like 
 Shawty you're mine, you're mine 
 What I look like? Open your eyes, you're blind 
 What the fuck up I look like

 People telling all of those crazy lies to ya 
 You believe 'em I don't wanna accept the truth

 Sad to see you playing the fool 
 You don't know half the shit a nigga been through

 What the fuck up I look like 
 You're looking for love and I'm the one you imagine 
 With athlete money from just rapping 
 My body rapping Sir Valentino, Laura piano fashion 
 Sex with passion, romancing laughing 
 Happiness action restaurants relaxing 
 They got some good sushi and aspen 
 A good pussy I'm smashin 
 I call you Masa LIsa yeah I'm your visa 
 American express I must confess 
 I'll try to go beyond love 
 And this is hard to translate 
 Love is good but to me good is just an enemy of great 
 You wanna make it to the top 
 But you don't' got what ti take to be a model, actress, singer, stripper 
 Want me to help you to become a star 
 You was my sister, you was my soldier 
 Dam I used to miss you 
 I used to love you 
 I think to hold you 
 You didn't know me it was only just a mirage, mirage 
 You didn't know me it was only just a mirage, mirage 
 What the fuck I look like 
 Shawty you're mine, you're mine 
 What I look like? Open your eyes, you're blind 
 What the fuck up I look like 
 Yeah 
 What the fuck I look like? 
 What the fuck I look like? 
 Fucked up
