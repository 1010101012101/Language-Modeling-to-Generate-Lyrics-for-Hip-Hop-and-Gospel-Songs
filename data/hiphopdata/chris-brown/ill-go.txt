There's a star in the palm of my hand 
 And I think it yours 
 You don't want it 
 Then I'll understand 
 You deserve much more 
 When I brought it 
 Down from the sky, you almost forgot it 
 It was new back when you gave a damn 
 Whatcha need I'll go and get it 
 But if I don't come back 
 Girl your love was worth it 
 That's the one thing I know 
 And if I don't make it back 
 Girl remember that 
 That I said I'd go, baby 
 Girl your love is so hard 
 And it takes me so far 
 But I don't care, I'll go 
 If I don't make it home 
 Atleast now you know 
 There for you, I'll go. 
 Got my heart in the palm of your hand 
 Now you good, that's yours 
 If you don't want it 
 I won't understand 
 'Cause I came so far 
 When you tossed it 
 Took forever to find the place where you lost it 
 Now you're gone with my heart out the door 
 Home is here girl don't forget it 
 But if you don't come back 
 Girl this love was worth it 
 That's the one thing I knowwww, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 If you don't make it back 
 Girl remember that 
 That I said I'd go, for youuuu 
 Girl your love is so hard 
 And it takes me so far 
 But I don't care, I'll go 
 If I don't make it home 
 Then atleast now you knowwww 
 I'll go, go
