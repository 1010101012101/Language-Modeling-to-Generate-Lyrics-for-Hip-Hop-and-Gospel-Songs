Where that bar at... Tell me where that 
 Bout to buy the whole club where my credit card at 
 Money flying in the air, 
 Look at what I started 
 Asses clapping up in here, 
 Damn it's like an audience 
 And she bringing all her friends, 
 I'll be yo seesaw 
 She bout to act an ass... heehaw 
 Got a stupid monkey fatter than King Kong, 
 It's like a pistol on you, 
 Take it all off 
 Ha, you gone need an ambulance, 
 After you get done with this hammer in my pants, 
 Make it stand up, 
 Watch it dance, 
 All mouth, no hands. 
 I tried to tell you niggers, 
 I'm the greatest! 
 You bitch made hater 
 Shoes crocodile 
 Fuck gators! 
 Ain't no need to talk 
 Nigger pay us! 
 I'm about to go, go! go! (loco) 
 Go, go

 Go, go! I'm about to go loco! 
 Go, go!

 Look oh damn my liver 
 Damn I got the shivers, 
 My family got that bomb weed... but all I need is liquor 
 And then she got that butt, thicker than a snicker 
 And shawty got that fye, so I pop her like a blister (eww) 
 I know you think I'm losing it but why you speed ballin 
 Nigger I am cruisin bitch, nigga we ballin 
 And when I go to sleep, my tattoos come to life, 
 Hoes in your head, out of mind, out of site 
 That's why they call me breezy 
 Baby, cold as ice 
 Boy don't make me paint a portrait, rearrange your life 
 All my kicks fly, they power ranger nikes 
 I'm the shit, 
 Nigger ain't gotta say it twice 
 Tony the tiger, call me Tony! 
 Cause everything is great, was she twerkin' on me! 
 Boy I ain't no kin ta ya 
 I am from Virginia, A F O nigger let go, 
 Man they can't get rid of us? 
 I tried to tell you niggers, 
 I'm the greatest! 
 You bitch made hater 
 Shoes crocodile 
 Fuck gators! 
 Ain't no need to talk 
 Nigger pay us! 
 I'm about to go, go! go! (loco) 
 Go, go 
 My nigga just (crazy) 
 Go, go! I'm about to go loco! 
 Go, go! 
 That nigga just (crazy)
