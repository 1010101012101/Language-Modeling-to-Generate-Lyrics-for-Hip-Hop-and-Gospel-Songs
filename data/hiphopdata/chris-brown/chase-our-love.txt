We can jet, believe it 
 I know that you won't 
 And yes, there's a feelin' 
 We both need to know 
 Let us start now 
 It's that time 
 So let's travel 
 And see the light 
 (And I'm) 
 Gonna take you out 
 Anywhere you wanna go now 
 (If you ride) 
 To the town 
 Where we both can party now 
 Drink in London 
 Dance in Paris 
 Let's chase our love 
 Let's chase our love 
 Shout real loud now 
 And let them hear us 
 Let's chase our love 
 Let's chase our love 
 Tonight, night, night, night 
 Night, night, night 
 Tonight, night, night, night 
 Let's chase our love 
 Let's chase our love 
 Tonight, night, night 
 Tonight, night, night 
 If it's evening 
 We'll party till morning 
 Let us start now 
 It's that time 
 So let's travel, see the light 
 I'll watch you shine 
 Drink in London 
 Dance in Paris 
 Let's chase our love 
 Let's chase our love 
 Shout real loud now 
 And let them hear us 
 Let's chase our love 
 Let's chase our love 
 Tonight, night, night, night 
 Night, night, night 
 Tonight, night, night, night 
 Let's chase our love 
 Let's chase our love 
 Tonight, night, night 
 Tonight, night, night
