 (Been with) 
 I see you, baby, it just ain't the same 
 (No no, no no, no no) 
 Recently I had a girl and her name was Nikki 
 But she left me 'cause I called her your name 
 (No no, no no) 
 And I been on that rebound tip

 And every other morning it's your face that I miss

 And I was on that bull when I was with you

 I wanna reclaim her but she'll never get over 
 What I put you through 
 And there's nothin' that I wouldn't do
