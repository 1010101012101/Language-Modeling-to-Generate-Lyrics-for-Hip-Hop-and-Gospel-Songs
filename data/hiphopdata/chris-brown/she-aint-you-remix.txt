She a-ain't, she ain't you, no 
 She a-ain't, she ain't you, no 
 She a-ain't, she ain't you, no 
 She a-ain't, she ain't you 
 You make it hard for me 
 To see somebody else 
 I'm calling her your name 
 And yeah its messed up 
 'Cause I'm thinking 'bout you 
 It's your fault, babe 
 I never wanted us to break up 
 No, not this way 
 But you don't understand it 
 No I don't 
 Because when you had me 
 You didn't know how to treat me 
 You thought my love would be right here 
 And that's what I said 
 But you told me that I was the only one for you 
 Now that's what you make me going through 
 Now I'm so confuse 
 Now you're saying 
 I think I better let her go 
 I can't leave you alone 
 Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you 
 (And now that you've seen the light) 
 (You want me to change my mind) 
 (Because you're sitting here like) 
 She ain't you 
 (Whoa oh oh) Na na na na na 
 (Whoa oh oh) Na na na na na 
 (Whoa oh oh) Na na na na na 
 S-W-V 
 She ain't, no she ain't 
 I'm not in the toughest time 
 Caught how fiddly you are 
 You had a change of heart 
 What was that all about 
 She doesn't hold you down like me 
 She probably up in the street buying Louboutin with your credit card 
 Now you're begging me to come home 
 When she touches me 
 I'm wishing that they were your hands 
 And when I'm with her its only 'bout the sex 
 With you I had a bad romance 
 And if I could (And if I could) 
 Just trade her in I would (I would) 
 Because nobody compares to you no... yeah 
 I think I better let her go 
 I can't leave you alone 
 Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you 
 (And now that you've seen the light) 
 (You want me to change my mind) 
 (Because you're sitting here like) 
 She ain't you 
 No she a-ain't, she ain't you (x8) 
 S-W-V 
 I think I better let her go 
 I can't leave you alone 
 Every day that I'm with her, all I want is you 
 (And now that you've seen the light) 
 (You want me to change my mind) 
 (Because you're sitting here like) 
 She ain't you 
 (Whoa oh oh) Na na na na na 
 (Whoa oh oh) Na na na na na 
 (Whoa oh oh) Na na na na na
