This may be my last time 
 So Imma do whatever 
 This may be my last chance 
 With me and you together 
 I can be your honey comb 
 And we can together 
 You're so sweet, I taste it baby 
 I just, I just 
 I wanna see you putting it together like a number 
 Multiply the time, then take it all off 
 And maybe we should just add up our love 
 I know your heart 
 Your kiss drives me crazy babe 
 We don't gotta fake this shit when we loving 
 Cause the others ones got it and they be lying about it 
 Can't live a day in a life 
 Just do what you like 
 Do what you like 
 Do what you like 
 Come on baby, it's your world I wanna live in 
 And I'm loving this feeling 
 Do what you like 
 Do what you like 
 Do what you like 
 Just like that, girl I know you like that 
 And we only got time to love 
 This won't be my last chance 
 So Imma do whatever 
 It takes to get you out here 
 So Imma be smooth and clever 
 Let me get in your comfort zone 
 Girl we can move together 
 Spinning round, I got you baby 
 I just, I just 
 I wanna see you putting it together like a number 
 Multiply the time, then you take it all off 
 And maybe we should just add up our love 
 I know your heart 
 Your kiss drives me crazy babe
