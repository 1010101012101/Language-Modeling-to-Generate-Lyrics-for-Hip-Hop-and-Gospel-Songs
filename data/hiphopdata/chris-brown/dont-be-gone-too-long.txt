I dug a single seed into the ground 
 I hope it grows (grows) 
 In a year or two if you're around 
 You'll see a rose (rose) 
 Pick me up and keep me hidden somewhere 
 That you can find me 
 On a train to Paris going nowhere 
 Draw the bridge behind me 
 Don't be gone too long 
 Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone 
 Don't be gone too long 
 Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone? 
 When you're, When you're gone 
 When you're gone 
 Golden leaves are dancing on the ground 
 It's getting cold (cold) 
 Say some time we'll be forever young 
 Never old (old) 
 See a ball of fire out of space 
 Zooming up behind me 
 All the wonder written on your face 
 Was there inside me 
 Don't be gone too long 
 Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone 
 Don't be gone too long 
 Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone? 
 When you're, When you're gone 
 When you're gone 
 Bring it back to me 
 Bring it back to me, is it really over? 
 Bring it back to me, bring it back to me 
 Bring it back to me 
 Bring it back to me, is it really over? 
 Bring it back to me, bring it back to me 
 Don't be gone too long 
 Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone 
 Don't be gone too long 
 Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone? 
 Don't be gone too long 
 Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone 
 Don't be gone too long 
 Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone?
