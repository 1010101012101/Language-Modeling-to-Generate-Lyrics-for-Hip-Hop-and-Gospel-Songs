 All my ladies (all all)

 Verse: Chris Brown

 Watch my do my dougie bet the shawty's think I'm handsome (yeah yeah yeah yeah) 
 Ain't a seat in Baily's on the daily ciroc by the case-o 
 Party all night long we ain't stoppin' till I say so

 Got your hand up if you feeling real good say yeah 
 Throw ya tens up and keep'em right there

 Just like that just like this 
 Whatever it is shawty you got it 
 Like a game of tag shawty you got it 
 And shawty got ass that you can't miss she do shit 
 Lighter's up but just put up ya cell phones 
 Dark skinned girls turn me on so do red bones 
 Racing to the V.I.P. looking like a marathon 
 Too many bottles left over get some and carry home 
 And I'mma turn it up and all the n**gas smoking tell'em burn it up 
 She got me pinned against the wall 
 She about to make up stand up 
 I'mma put my muthafuckin' hands up 
 Put your hands in the air if you wanna freak some down tonight 
 Put (put put) your hands in the air all my ladies, ladies, ladies 
 Just like that 
 Just like that (at at at) 
 Just like that 
 All my ladies (all all)
