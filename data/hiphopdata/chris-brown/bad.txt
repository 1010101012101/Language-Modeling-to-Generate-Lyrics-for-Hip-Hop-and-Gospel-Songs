(Soulja Boy) 
 She bad, like a student in detention 
 Walk inside the club and my chain just glistenin' 
 Soulja Boy Tell 'Em yeah I got Chris wit me 
 I bet I drank the bottle till that b-tch empty 
 Gucci belt plus Louis when I hop up out my phantom 
 Turn my swag on, all the girls say I'm handsome 
 I maybe in my lambo or my jet, it doesn't matter 
 She bad, she bad, she bad, but she's badder 
 (Chris Brown) 
 She lookin' at me, I'm thinkin' that she, that she bad than a mother 
 She staring at me, I'm thinkin' that she she a fine mothersucka 
 She a fine mothersucka, and I think I love her 
 Ooh I think she likes me, I'll keep her through the summer 
 Ride me like a wave have you screamin' cawabunga 
 Bubble bootylicious, make a nigga wanna pop her 
 Let me know just how you want it 
 Watch how quick I get up on it 
 Once I get up on yo body 
 Shawty I'ma keep it rockin' 
 (Chris Brown - Chorus x2) 
 Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too 
 Shawty she bad, she cute, she sexy too 
 Shawty she bad, she cute, she sexy too 
 But she never been with a dude like me, who do it like I do 
 (Chris Brown) 
 She lookin' at me I'm thinking that she that she bad than a mother 
 That juicy booty got me thinkin' that's she the daughter of a trucker 
 She's the daughter of a trucker booty like a mac truck 
 Pull up to her bumper love the way she back it up 
 Say I got alot of talk, shawty I can back it up 
 When I put it on her shawty just can't get enough 
 Let me know just how you want it 
 Watch how quick I get up on it 
 Once I get up on yo body 
 Shawty I'ma keep it rockin' 
 (Chris Brown - Chorus 2x) 
 Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too 
 Shawty she bad, she cute, she sexy too 
 Shawty she bad, she cute, she sexy too 
 But she never been with a dude like me, who do it like I do 
 (Soulja Boy) 
 Man she so beautiful she so super straight 
 In the club gettin' dollars, yeah she gettin' paid 
 She bad, she bad, she badder 
 Hop up in my jag my jag my jaguar 
 Pull up in my jag with the ice cream paint 
 I need a 150 thousand just to watch me blink 
 Baby girl fine and her outfit paint 
 Let's leave this club, heavy to my place 
 I'm like man she so beautiful she so super straight 
 In the club gettin' dollars, yeah she gettin' paid 
 She bad, she bad, she badder 
 Hop up in my jag, my jag my jaguar 
 (Chris Brown - Chorus 2x) 
 Shawty, she bad, she cute, she sexy too 
 Shawty she bad, she cute, she sexy too 
 Shawty she bad, she cute, she sexy too 
 But she never been with a dude like me, who do it like I do
