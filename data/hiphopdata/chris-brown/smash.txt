Guess who's steppin' in the room, 
 It's your boy breezy hit 'em with the autotune, 
 Automatic, systematic, robo dude, 
 'Cause I want to, 
 I'm the kinda guy that don't follow rules 
 So c'mon baby girl lets break a few, 
 But let me say this 
 Hold, on, are you sure you wanna play with fire? 
 I'm guaranteed to take it higher, if you don't think then you're a liar, yeah 
 CHORUS: You don't want my number baby, you don't want my math, 
 I know what you want, I know what you want, 
 You don't want no picture baby or no autograph 
 I know what you want, I know what you want, 
 You wanna hit it hit it hit it smash 
 Hit it hit it hit it smash (x3) 
 I know her game, she all the same 
 I don't even really wanna know her name, 
 She went down town like a stock exchange, 
 But all her friends kept clock blockin' man
