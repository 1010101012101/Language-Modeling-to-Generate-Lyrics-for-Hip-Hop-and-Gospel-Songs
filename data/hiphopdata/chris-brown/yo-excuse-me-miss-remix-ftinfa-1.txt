 On a second thought that ain't the way to go 
 I got give her game proper 
 Spit it so she get it 
 There she is I got to stop her 
 Or should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before) 
 Or what about her style? (Too obvious) 
 I'm out of time 
 She's out the door 
 I got to go for mine 
 I think I'll say 
 Yo 
 I don't know your name but excuse me miss 
 I saw you from across the room 
 And I got to admit that you got my attention 
 You're making me want to say yo 
 I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss 
 I saved the last dance for you 
 How I'd love to keep you here with me oh baby 
 (CB) 
 Now shorty grab hold of my hand 
 And let's pretend the floor is ours 
 You say you don't really dance 
 Don't worry about it 
 We'll just 1, 2 step 
 1, 2 step 
 Now if the music is moving too fast 
 Grab my hand a little tighter (tighter) 
 Don't be afraid to move a little closer 
 Girl, there is something about you that makes me want to say 
 Yo 
 I don't know your name but excuse me miss 
 I saw you from across the room 
 And I got to admit that you got my attention 
 You're making me want to say yo 
 I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss 
 I saved the last dance for you 
 How I'd love to keep you here with me oh baby

 Ain't nothing wrong with dancing 
 Baby your so romantic 
 Baby I can be in your heart 
 So many things I want to tell you 
 I think that I should start by saying 
 (I1) 
 Yo,

 Slow down lets speak for a minute 
 Slow Jams you got me all in it 
 You smiling cause' you getting deep feelings 
 Looking in your eyes I can see your heart 
 And by surprise I really done played my part 
 Now I know that I got you girl 
 I know it's there every time I look at you girl 
 And say... 
 Yo,

 Spit it so she get it 
 There she is I got to stop her

 I saved the last dance for you 
 How I'd love to keep you here with me oh baby 
 (CB)
