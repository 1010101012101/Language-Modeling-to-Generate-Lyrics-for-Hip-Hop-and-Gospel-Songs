I shoulda been a better man. instead of wasting time. 
 Spending my life, searching for the finer things. 
 Whoa-oh-oh-oh. 
 You always gave me another chance to make it right. 
 But I didn't deserve, because I didn't understand. 
 And I feel so bad 
 Because you wouldn't do that same to me 
 But I know what your weakness is 
 And you feel so bad 
 And now you're on a open road 
 So done not looking back. 
 I thought I had you on a leash 
 Like I could do whatever I wanted to and I wanted to 
 And you was gonna wait for me baby no oh-oh-ah. 
 And now the day wasn't turning out for you like you're the master 
 And I'm on the strings, 
 You're in control of me. 
 And I feel so bad 
 And now you're doing it to me 
 Because you know what my weakness is 
 And you feel so bad 
 And now I'm on an open road tryna go but I'm looking back. 
 I'm looking for her. 
 I'm tryna find her. 
 I really need her. 
 I think I love her. 
 I'm looking her. 
 I'm tryna find her. 
 I really need her. 
 I think I love her. 
 You can blame it all on me, 
 I know it's like this because of me. 
 And now I'm just like a hitch-hiker waiting for a ride 
 With no cars in sight. 
 And it feels so bad 
 Because you wouldn't do the same to me 
 Because I know what your weakness is and I feel so bad 
 And now you're on an open road long gone I can't have you back. 
 I'm looking for her. 
 I'm tryna find her. 
 I really need her. 
 I think I love her. 
 I wanna see her. 
 Whoa, I don't ever wanna leave ya. 
 I wanna keep ya. 
 I think I love her.
