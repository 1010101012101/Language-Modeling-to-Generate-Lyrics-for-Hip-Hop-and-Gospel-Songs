In a world full of people 
 Why do I feel so damn alone 
 On a mountain so high 
 Oh I wish I had a clone 
 I look up in the sky 
 And realize this is where I belong 
 And if I'm really here 
 Then why do I feel so gone 
 I ain't trippin' 
 I ain't trippin' 
 I ain't trippin' no 
 If I ain't trippin' 
 Why you trippin' 
 What you trippin' for 
 No I ain't worried 'bout a thing, Imma still behave 
 I ain't trippin' 
 I ain't trippin' 
 I ain't trippin' no 
 I can have all the money in the world 
 But I won't change, I won't change 
 I can have all the girls in the world 
 But I won't change, I won't change 
 Ooh, it's just me and my team 
 Ooh, O.H.B 
 Don't even look back to the past 
 When I can see inside the future 
 Girl I won't carry you on my back 
 You get down, you down for the ride 
 We can go so high to the sky 
 Ain't nobody touching us now 
 They can run they mouth all the want 
 Ain't nobody stopping us now 
 I ain't trippin' 
 I ain't trippin' 
 I ain't trippin' no 
 If I ain't trippin' 
 Why you trippin' 
 What you trippin' for 
 No I ain't worried 'bout a thing, Imma still behave 
 I ain't trippin' 
 I ain't trippin' 
 I ain't trippin' no 
 I can have all the money in the world 
 But I won't change, I won't change 
 I can have all the girls in the world 
 But I won't change, I won't change 
 Ooh, Baby be on my team 
 Ooh, O.H.B 
 Baby, can we do this 
 'Cause right now I'm about to take it all off 
 Forgive me 
 You better not lose that smile 
 You know that pretty little face that you make when you want it now 
 I like it better when you mad 
 I won't complain 
 I ain't trippin' 
 I ain't trippin' 
 I ain't trippin' no 
 If I ain't trippin' 
 Why you trippin' 
 What you trippin' for 
 No I ain't worried 'bout a thing, Imma still behave 
 I ain't trippin' 
 I ain't trippin' 
 I ain't trippin' no 
 I can have all the money in the world 
 But I won't change, I won't change 
 I can have all the girls in the world 
 I won't change, I won't change 
 Ooh, it's just me and my team 
 Ooh, O.H.B
