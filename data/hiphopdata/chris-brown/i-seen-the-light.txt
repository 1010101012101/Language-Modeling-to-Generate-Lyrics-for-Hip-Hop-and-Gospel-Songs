"See The Light" 
 By Chris Brown 
 1st Verse: 
 It's been a struggle for me, 
 Wonderin' why I can't get by with my life, 
 But now I'm free, 
 And I done did some right and wrong, 
 But still I see the light, 
 And I done been around the sex and drugs, 
 Hustlin' but mama ain't raise no thug, 
 And it took a little to see how real it could get, 
 And how this life wasn't meant for me 'cause I, 
 Seen a lot of bad things on my block, 
 But I ain't wonna be a victim of a gunshot, 
 I can't let nothing' hold me down 
 See all the things I read about, 
 See all the things I've heard about, 
 I seen the light 
 2nd Verse: 
 It's kinda hard for me, 
 To stay away from all these girls and the haters they don't like, 
 That I'm fulfillin' my dream, 
 But I'm just tryna do my thing, 
 My nigga can't I live my life, 
 I got the world on my shoulders (shoulders), 
 And I'm only getting' older (older), 
 But it's like it's getting' colder, 
 I'm gone make it but I can't take it sometimes, 
 I came a long way from my block, 
 And I'm grateful for everything I got, 
 I didn't let nothing' bring me down 
 Aw man, after all this, who would've thought, little boy from Tappahannock, Virginia, 
 You know what I'm sayin', would make it all the way to the top. 
 Rap: 
 Life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a righteous spirit, 
 They try to show us the light but we don't like to hear it, 
 Mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics, 
 A large heard across my sight I had to fight to clear it, 
 Like a runner a couple of summers I often wondered if it 
 Really was winter and that's when I heard the thunder, 
 A current was occurin' it was stirrin' up my hunger, 
 But I couldn't let the shit burry a nigga under, 
 Use to cry hopin' all of this would pass, 
 And then I learned to use my tears to water up the grass, 
 A part of my swagga but apparently I won, 
 I took my shades off and now I'm starin' at the sun, 
 I'm seein' the light, I'm seein the light, 
 Realizing' that it's me in the light, 
 I read about it (read about it), heard about it (heard about it) now I know 
 I coulda did wrong, 
 I seen a lot of people hustle, 
 But I left them things alone, 
 I almost lost my friend to the struggle, 
 But I guess that made me strong, 
 Made me strong, 
 I seen a whole lot of drama, 
 And it taught me how to fight, 
 Taught me how to fight, 
 And I thank God for my mama, 
 She showed me what was right, 
 I coulda been in the dark, 
 But thank God for the light, 
 (I see the light) I see the light 
 End adlibs: 
 All the things I heard about, 
 I read about it, I read about it, oh, 
 I see the light, I see the light
