 Wow womp womp womp... it's what your body sayin'. 
 Chris Brown is in the building. 
 Young boy just turned 16 
 And I got 64's and hot bikes that I rock 
 Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock, 
 But all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em vicious. 
 Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop, 
 'Cause you speaking that slang that I talk. 
 That sassy tempo with that walk, 
 Maybe the reason that all this teenies may never see me. 
 Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that) 
 You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that) 
 I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac, 
 You could be in the back saying (gimme, gimme, gimme) 
 Ma, take a break, let me explain to you, 
 What ya body got a young boy ready to do. 
 If you take a chance to let me put them things on you, 
 I could show you why I make them straight A's in school. 
 I'm a HUSTLA! Trust my frame and age. 
 Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page. 
 I can PICTURE! Us switching lanes in the coupe 
 With you on the phone screaming my name. 
 (Chris!) 
 Three years older aaaaaih
