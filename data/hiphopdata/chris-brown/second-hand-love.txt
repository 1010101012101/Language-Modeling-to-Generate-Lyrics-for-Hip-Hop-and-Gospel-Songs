Filter out the pain 
 If you're gonna take my breath away 
 Black lungs, intoxicating 
 I'm addicted to your poison 
 There it goes 
 I'm just fading as fast as she came 
 If I die, then you'll know who to blame 
 All because of you 
 You give me second hand love 
 Like second hand smoke 
 I keep breathing it in 
 That's just how it goes with you 
 I'm used to your poison 
 You give me second hand love 
 Like second hand smoke 
 I keep breathing it in 
 That's just how it goes with you 
 You're killing me slowly 
 Nicotine dreams 
 Gas lit lover 
 Temporary high 
 Then I suffer 
 Take my breath away 
 I think it's what I need 
 You took all of my nightmares out the safe 
 Girl your menthol kisses - I made my business 
 Now my breathing's different 
 There it goes 
 I'm just fading as fast as she came 
 If I die, then you'll know who to blame 
 All because of you 
 You give me second hand love 
 Like second hand smoke 
 I keep breathing it in 
 That's just how it goes with you 
 I'm used to your poison 
 You give me second hand love 
 Like second hand smoke 
 I keep breathing it in 
 That's just how it goes with you 
 You're killing me slowly 
 Carry me girl 
 Carry me, carry me away 
 Like the smoke yeah 
 Like the smoke that you blew my way 
 How could you babe? 
 How could you babe? 
 Put a filter on your love, oh yeah 
 Carry me girl 
 Carry me, carry me away 
 Like the smoke yeah 
 Like the smoke that you blew my way 
 There it goes 
 I'm just fading as fast as she came 
 If I die, then you'll know who to blame 
 All because of you 
 You give me second hand love 
 Like second hand smoke 
 I keep breathing it in 
 That's just how it goes with you 
 I'm used to your poison 
 You give me second hand love 
 Like second hand smoke 
 I keep breathing it in 
 That's just how it goes with you 
 You're killing me slowly
