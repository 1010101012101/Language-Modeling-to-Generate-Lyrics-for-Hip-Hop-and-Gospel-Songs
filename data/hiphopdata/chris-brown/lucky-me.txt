Lights on, stage set. 
 I guess I gotta put on a show yeah cause everyone's waiting. 
 Females, fly jets. 
 When I turn the radio on I hear all my songs play (yeah) 
 Whatever money can buy 
 I probably got it (that's real talk, yeah) 
 I see my name in the sky all over the world 
 And I just sit hear saying 
 Lucky m.e 
 I gotta pose for the cameras 
 Even when my world's falling down 
 I still wear a smile 
 Lucky me. 
 Even though I'm so damaged 
 I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd 
 Lucky me. 
 Pray none of my loved ones wanna be stars, 
 Cause nobody said it would be so hard 
 Wouldn't put this on no one else, else 
 Lucky me. 
 So exclusive. 
 I don't have to wait in at line 
 It's like the club is mine now. 
 If it was only that simple 
 Then what I'm sayin's easy to do 
 And we know that's not true 
 Whatever money can buy 
 I probably got it (that's real talk, yeah) 
 I see my name in the sky all over the world 
 And I just sit hear saying 
 Lucky me. 
 I gotta pose for the cameras 
 Even when my world's falling down 
 I still wear a smile 
 Lucky me. 
 Even though I'm so damaged 
 I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd 
 Lucky me. 
 Pray none of my loved ones wanna be stars, 
 Cause nobody said it'd be so hard 
 Wouldn't put this on no one else, else. 
 Lucky me. 
 My dream and it's my heart 
 The life of being a star 
 You don't even know how hard it is, do you (yeah) 
 Now I'm thankful for everything 
 And I'm finally becoming a man 
 Now I gotta bigger show to do, 
 Lucky me. 
 I gotta pose for the cameras 
 Even when my world's falling down 
 I still wear a smile 
 Lucky me. 
 Even though I'm so damaged 
 I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd 
 Lucky me. 
 Pray none of my loved ones wanna be stars, 
 Cause nobody said it'd be so hard 
 I wouldn't wish this on no one else, else. 
 Lucky me.
