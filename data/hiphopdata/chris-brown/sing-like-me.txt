I got her singing 
 I got her singing 
 I got her singing 
 I got her singing, oh 
 I got her singing, oh 
 I got her singing, oh 
 I got her singing, oh 
 Soon as I step out the whip they spot me, 
 Girls snappin pictures like the paparazzi 
 So many different type of women I'm into 
 And I can't take em' all with me is my only issue 
 I wanna leave out of here and take 'em back to the crib 
 And show how I do the cho-cha 
 Hit it like so-sa 
 I wanna leave out of here and take 'em back to the crib 
 Cause you know what I thinkin' with the love that I'm makin' 
 There so many woman 
 Up in this club that I can choose from 
 And they all look amazing 
 That's why it's so hard to just pick one 
 When I get them off to the room 
 We ain't playing by no rules 
 Got 'em singing melodies 
 And it sounds like ya favorite song playing on the radio 
 Can't get enough of me 
 Gotta girl singing like me 
 Gotta girl singing like me 
 Gotta girl singing like me 
 Gotta girl singing like me 
 All these bottles poppin' got me feeling nicely 
 Leaving by myself feels highly unlikely 
 Lookin' for a right now don't need no wifey 
 Settling down one chick that ain't even like me 
 So many women in the atmosphere 
 Gotta leave with at least three in a pair 
 The look in they eyes tellin' me that they want it 
 Dnt like it that much to put a ring on it 
 There so many woman 
 Up in this club that I can choose from 
 And they all look amazing 
 That's why it's so hard to just pick one 
 When I get them off to the room 
 We ain't playing by no rules 
 Got 'em singing melodies 
 And it sounds like ya favorite song playing on the radio 
 Can't get enough of me 
 Gotta girl singing like me 
 Gotta girl singing like me 
 Gotta girl singing like me 
 Gotta girl singing like me 
 When I'm whisperin in your ear, I know I got you listening baby 
 I know your liking what you hear, now let's leave up out of here baby 
 When I'm whisperin in your ear, I know I got you listening baby 
 'Cause when I put my hands on you, girl I'm gonna drive your body crazy 
 When I get them off to the room 
 We ain't playing by no rules 
 Got 'em singing melodies 
 And it sounds like ya favorite song playing on the radio 
 Can't get enough of me 
 Gotta girl singing like me 
 Gotta girl singing like me 
 Gotta girl singing like me
