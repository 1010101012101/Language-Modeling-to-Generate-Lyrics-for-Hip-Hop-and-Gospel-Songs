How did we get to my place 
 After last night, I'm looking for steps to trace 
 All I know is we make love all over my place 
 And that's all I can remember but, my condo gave me play by play 
 Started when I seen all of the bottles of patron 
 Empty, obvious there's something crazy going on 
 Sex is everywhere 
 Whip cream all over the counter 
 But she's no where to be found 
 I took a look around, but the only thing I found was 
 Lipstick on the glass 
 'Cause we drink, got drunk, that night we lived it up 
 Yeah, that night we did it up 
 Now the only trace I found is 
 Lipstick on the glass 
 Shot after shot, we got a hot and we tore it up 
 Now all I got left is the 
 Lipstick on the glass 
 I can still smell your perfume in my home 
 I can still taste the sweetness of your touch 
 I should ask the neighbors, maybe they know 
 I know they heard us lovin' on the night before 
 I'm tryna find out where you are 
 Hope you not very far 
 I gotta find you girl so we can have another night with all these 
 Bottles of patron 
 Empty, obvious there's something crazy going on 
 Sex is everywhere 
 Whip cream all over the counter 
 But she's no where to be found 
 I took a look around, but the only thing I found was 
 Lipstick on the glass 
 'Cause we drink, got drunk, that night we lived it up 
 Yeah, that night we did it up 
 Now the only trace I found is 
 Lipstick on the glass 
 Shot after shot, we got a hot and we tore it up 
 Now all I got left is the 
 Lipstick on the glass 
 Left her lipstick on the glass 
 She left her lipstick on the glass 
 Saying this the best night she ever had 
 Lipstick on my glass 
 Saying call her A.S.A.P 
 She'll be ready 
 Lipstick on the glass 
 'Cause we drink, got drunk, that night we lived it up 
 Yeah, that night we did it up 
 Now the only trace I found is 
 Lipstick on the glass 
 Shot after shot, we got a hot and we tore it up 
 Now all I got left is the 
 Lipstick on the glass
