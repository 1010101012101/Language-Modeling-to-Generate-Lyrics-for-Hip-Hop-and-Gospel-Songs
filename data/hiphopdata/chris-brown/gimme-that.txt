 Wow wow wow wow... it's what your body sayin'. 
 Chris Brown is in the building. 
 The young boy just turned 16 
 And I got 64's and hot bikes that I rock 
 Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock, 
 But all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him. 
 Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop, cause you speaking that slang that I talk. 
 That sassy tempo with that walk, maybe the reason that all this jeans (?) may never see me. 
 Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that) 
 You be talking like you like what I got (gimme that) 
 I know you like it how I lean in the lac, 
 You can be in the bac saying (gimme, gimme, gimme) 
 (Repeat Song: 2x)
