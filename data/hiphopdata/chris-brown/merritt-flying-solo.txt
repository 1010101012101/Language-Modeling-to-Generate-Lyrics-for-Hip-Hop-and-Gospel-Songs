Departure time 7.30 
 I'm packed and ready to go 
 First class ticket out of here 
 I think it's time to put it back in gear 
 No more stand by 
 I'm tryna steer clear, oh 
 Turbulence got me nervous 
 I shoulda never flown 
 Scared when you fly alone again 
 You know the atmosphere wasn't perfect 
 I'm thinking to myself, was it worth it? 
 Layovers almost over 
 I can see clear 
 No more stormy weather 
 Exit don't pull on the lever, lever, 
 This gon? be my final destination 
 No more sitting round having my time wasted 
 You say it's now or never 
 I pick never, 
 We can be together 
 So calm down 
 No more red eye late nights 
 Or one way no more connected flights 
 Well... 
 When we started I know this relationship was unhealthy 
 You broke the code 
 Never thought that you would stoop so low 
 You got me flying solo 
 Now you crying talking about you can't live without me 
 My heart is sold 
 Shoulda never ever left me this cold 
 You got me flying solo 
 Solo solo 
 Solo solo 
 Solo solo 
 Solo solo 
 You got me flying, You got me flying solo 
 Solo solo 
 Solo solo 
 Solo solo 
 Solo solo 
 You got me flying, You got me flying solo 
 Touching down 11.30 
 I'm rushing through the doors 
 I'm in a good place now 
 I can't find my baggage 
 And I don't even want it back 
 I don't wanna have it no more 
 I don't need to carry on 
 It's gonna weigh me down 
 You didn't think that I would find out 
 Whether or not 
 Who was wrong or right 
 I can't talk now 
 I gotta catch another flight 
 Layovers almost over 
 I can see clear 
 No more stormy weather 
 Exit don't pull on the lever, lever, 
 This gon? be my final destination 
 No more sitting round having my time wasted 
 You say it's now or never 
 I pick never, 
 We can be together 
 So calm down 
 No more red eye late nights 
 Or one way no more connected flights

 You got me flying, You got me flying solo 
 Solo solo 
 Solo solo 
 Solo solo 
 Solo solo 
 You got me flying, You got me flying solo 
 Thought I was scared 
 To fly without you here 
 Now you can't get under my skin 
 Like you did before, 
 Why 
 I was so reluctant to walk out on us 
 So now I'm taking back my life, 
 Goodbye 
 Yeah, yeah
