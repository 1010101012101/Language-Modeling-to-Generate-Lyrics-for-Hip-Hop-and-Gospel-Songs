I don't know why I even try 
 Cause you don't want this no more 
 I would rather leave, before I hurt you 
 And I would've died long ago, if I ain't have my faith 
 I see you starting to hate me 
 I see it in your face 
 My home don't feel like home 
 Just like my heart, it's empty 
 You changed the number on you phone 
 So when I call you ain't gotta listen 
 And all your girls think that I ain't shit 
 And they the same ones lost in the club 
 Them bitches is basic 
 And now I'm number one that's lost in love 
 I can't take it 
 I'm on a knee 
 You're gonna see a grown man cry 
 I won't lie 
 I'm starting to hate me 
 (A little more and more each day) 
 I don't know me 
 It's like I can't get out of my own way 
 You don't love me 
 You don't love me 
 If I knew better 
 I would do better 
 Looking at the names on your list and I can't find me 
 I'm deep underwater, are you gon' let me drown? 
 I see you're happy now 
 You're the life of the party, acting out 
 Ain't seen you in months, you ain't call me once 
 And all your boys say that I ain't shit 
 And they the same ones lost in the club 
 Them niggas is basic 
 And I'm the one who lost in love 
 And I can't take it 
 I'm on my knees 
 Don't you hate to see me cry? 
 I won't lie 
 I'm starting to hate me 
 A little more and more each day 
 I don't know me 
 It's like I can't get out of my own way 
 And you don't love me 
 You don't love me 
 If I knew better 
 I would do better (better) 
 Thinking 'bout you and I 
 Thinking 'bout you and I 
 My heart's beating in slow motion 
 Knowing that it's over 
 Thoughts got me thinking bout suicide 
 Baby this is do or die 
 When you told me it's over 
 Ain't no point in being sober 
 All I wanna do is fade away 
 I hope that God will forgive me 
 'Cause I know you ain't gon miss me 
 Baby girl I won't try, to say my goodbyes 
 You ain't gotta shed a tear for me 
 Baby girl don't cry 
 I'm starting to hate me 
 A little more and more each day 
 I don't know me 
 It's like I can't get out of my own way 
 And you don't love me
