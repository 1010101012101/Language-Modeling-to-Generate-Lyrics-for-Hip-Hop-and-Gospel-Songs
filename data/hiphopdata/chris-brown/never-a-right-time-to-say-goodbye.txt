Baby come here and sit down, let's talk 
 I got a lot to say so I guess I'll start by 
 Saying that I love you, 
 But you know, this thing ain't been 
 No walk in the park for us 
 I swear it'll only take a minute 
 You'll understand when I finish, yeah 
 And I don't wanna see you cry 
 But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so 
 How do you let it go? When you, 
 You just don't know? What's on, 
 The other side of the door 
 When you're walking out, talk about it 
 Everything I tried to remember to say 
 Just went out my head 
 So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand 
 There's never a right time to say goodbye 
 But I gotta make the first move 
 'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me 
 'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you 
 Girl it's not you, it's me 
 I kinda gotta figure out what I need (oh) 
 There's never a right time to say goodbye 
 But we know that we gotta go 
 Our separate ways 
 And I know it's hard but I gotta do it, 
 And it's killing me 
 Cause there's never a right time 
 Right time to say goodbye 
 Girl I know your heart is breaking 
 And a thousand times I 
 Found myself asking, "Why? Why?" 
 Why am I taking so long to say this? 
 But trust me, girl I never 
 Meant to crush your world 
 And I never 
 Thought I would see the day we grew apart 
 And I wanna know 
 How do you let it go? When you, 
 You just don't know? What's on, 
 The other side of the door 
 When you're walking ou not you it's me. 
 I kinda gotta figure out what I need (oh) 
 There's never a right time to say goodbye 
 But we know that we gotta go 
 Our separate ways 
 And I know it's hard but I gotta do it, 
 And it's killing me 
 Cause there's never a right time 
 Right time to say goodbye 
 There's never a right time to say goodbye 
 But I gotta make the first move 
 'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me 
 'Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you 
 Girl it's not you it's me. 
 I kinda gotta figure out what I need (oh) 
 There's never a right time to say goodbye 
 But we know that we gotta go 
 Our separate ways 
 And I know it's hard but I gotta do it, 
 And it's killing me 
 Cause there's never a right time 
 Right time to say goodbye
