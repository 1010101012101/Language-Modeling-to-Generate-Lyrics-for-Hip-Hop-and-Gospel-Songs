Check this out gurl, I know you sitting back there sayin' to ya self 
 I know he ain't tryin' to holla! 
 Nah 
 But it's somethin' I gotta tell ya, 
 Aww yeah Aww yeah you ain't got to do it though, 
 And I just want you to sit back and listen, 
 While I sing this song to you check me, listen 
 1st verse: 
 It's like the hardest thing for me to say, 
 Without crackin' a smile, 
 It's somethin' that we both really feel inside, 
 But never talked about, 
 They call it love oh yes they do, 
 A dangerous thing when you're part of the game, 
 So girl I feel you when you get emotional, 
 And don't wanna let me go, 
 Ha but it's somethin' I gotta tell ya 
 Don't mean to cut you off but the question is, 
 (So when you gon be my girl), 
 When you gon be my girl I wanna know, 
 (When it comes to lovein) why, 
 (You change the subject) You should know, 
 (Girl you know that I'm the man), 
 I'm the man you want oh yes I am, 
 Girl what's really good wit ya, 
 (So when you gon be my girl) when you gon be my girl, 
 (All this playin' around is gettin' old now), 
 So baby tell me where I stand 
 2nd verse: 
 I know, you prolly sayin' to yourself this brotha trippin', 
 But this stuff is real (but ain't too many fellas would have the nerve to step up and tell that lady what's up) 
 To let her know he's real impressed, 
 Now gettin' straight to the bottom line, 
 You're the type of kinda girl, 
 A gangsta needs by his side, 
 So when you get emotional, 
 I won't let you go, 
 It's somethin' I gotta tell you 
 Don't mean to cut you off but the question is 
 (When you gon' be...) When you gon be my girl I gotta know, 
 (When it comes to lovin'...) You change the subject you should know (You change the subject) 
 (You should know that I'm the...) I'm the man you want Oh yes I am 
 So, girl what's really good witcha' (When you gon' be my girl) 
 All this playin' (all this playin' round's gettin' old now) 
 (So baby thell me where I stand) where do I stand tell me girl 
 I don't mean to be rude but I gotta know 
 (Chorus out)
