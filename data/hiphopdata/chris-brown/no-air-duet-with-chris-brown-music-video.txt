Tell me how I'm suppose to breathe with no air 
 If I 
 Should die 
 Before 
 I wake, 
 Its cause 
 You took 
 My breath 
 Away. 
 Losing you is like living in a world with no air 
 I'm here, 
 Alone, 
 Didn't want 
 To leave. 
 My heart won't move, 
 It's incomplete. 
 Wish there 
 Was a way 
 That I can make you to understand, 
 But how, 
 Do you expect me, 
 To live alone with just me? 
 'Cause my world revolves around you, 
 It's so hard for me to breathe. 
 Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air. 
 Can't live, can't breathe with no air. 
 That's how I feel when I know you ain't there. 
 There's no air, no air. 
 Got me out here in the water so deep. 
 Tell me how you gon' be without me. 
 If you ain't here, I just can't breathe. 
 Its no air no air. 
 No air air 
 No air air 
 No air air 
 No air air 
 I walked, 
 I ran, 
 I jumped, 
 I flew, 
 Right off the ground, 
 To float to you. 
 There's no gravity, 
 To hold me down, 
 For real. 
 But somehow 
 I'm still alive inside. 
 You took my breath, 
 But I survived. 
 I don't know how, 
 But I don't even care. 
 So how, 
 Do you expect me, 
 To live alone with just me? 
 'Cause my world revolves around you, 
 It's so hard for me to breathe. 
 Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air. 
 Can't live can't breathe with no air. 
 That's how I feel when I know you ain't there. 
 Its no air no air. 
 Got me out here in the water so deep. 
 Tell me how you gon' be without me. 
 If you ain't here, I just can't breathe 
 There's no air no air 
 No air air 
 No air air 
 It's no air no air 
 Hey 
 No air 
 Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air. 
 Can't live can't breathe with no air. 
 That's how I feel when I know you ain't there. 
 There's no air no air. 
 Got me out here in the water so deep. 
 Tell me how you gon' be without me. 
 If you ain't here I just can't breathe. 
 There's no air no air. 
 Do you expect me, 
 To live alone with just me? 
 'Cause my world revolves around you, 
 It's so hard for me to breathe. 
 Tell me how I'm supposed to breathe with no air. 
 Can't live can't breathe with no air. 
 That's how I feel when I know you ain't there. 
 It's no air no air. 
 Got me out here in the water so deep. 
 Tell me how you gon' be without me. 
 If you ain't here, I just can't breathe. 
 There's no air no air 
 No air air
