Ha! Hot damn, you look so appalled 
 My girl is the shit, your girl has no ass at all 
 Her booty super thick but her tummy super small 
 And when she dancin' her booty swallow up her draws 
 Yeah buddy in the club I do my dougie 
 Bottle in my hand mean muggin' like I'm ugly 
 Only models in my section get them uglies way from me 
 And when they be like, I just play dummy. 
 In the party got them white girls rolling like whoa 
 In the morning they be like where the fuck are my clothes 
 Please don't tell nobody 'cause I don't really do this, 
 Sure, what you think I'm stupid 
 I told her, just to call me dada 
 But shorty Spanish so she wanna call me papa 
 Or papi never met a nigga like me 
 I swept her up so I guess she had light feet 
 Can we make this an after party 
 'Cause yo body all on me 
 My head spinning round and round 
 Can we make this a nasty party 
 'Cause I just want ya body on mine body on mine 
 And take me down take me down now 
 Vans on, so I get my dance on 
 She said she fucked the whole crew I put my man's on 
 I threw my money on the table told her to dance on it 
 I pull that monster out, she put her hands on it. 
 Pool party Shawty going gnarly 
 Only fuck with rock stars and them boys whose riding Harleys 
 Bitch I'm on ya camera, no not iCarly 
 When she turn 21, I'm a drown her with Bacardi 
 Mmmmm hhhhhmmm, 151 heart beatin' like a drum 
 And my face is kinda numb 
 Stop that shit where that hatin' coming from 
 Oh you mad 'cause I got your girl faced in my cum 
 Can we make this an after party 
 'Cause your body all on me 
 My head spinning round and round 
 Can we make this a nasty party 
 'Cause I just want your body on mine body on mine 
 And take me down take me down down
