If I could, take a trip, to outer space 
 She would be the one, I will see 
 When I get, to heavens gate 
 She would welcome me with her arms, open wide, and a smile 
 Will shadow me brighter than the sun 
 She hasn't had a fair chance, so I'll give her one 
 Let me tell you who she is, yeah 
 She's a fallen angel, sent from heaven up above 
 She's a fallen angel, waitin for me to love her, yeah 
 (Know that she's) She's a fallen angel, take your judgment off her 
 I know, that she's a fallen angel 
 You know, I should 
 Help her mend, her broken wings 
 So she can fly again 
 But I don't, wanna lose everything that I've gained 
 Turnin' me a selfish man (oh) 
 Cause without 'em my heart just don't go, no more (no more) 
 I couldn't take the pain, from watchin her fly away 
 So say that you'll stay 
 She's mine 
 She's a fallen angel, (ooh) sent from heaven up above 
 She's a fallen angel, waitin for me to love her, yeah 
 (Know that she's) She's a fallen angel, so take your judgment off her 
 I know, that she's a fallen angel 
 Don't you 
 Baby don't you (don't you worry) worry 
 I'm gon help you (I'm gon help you) fly 
 (I'm gon help you fly) 
 Just take me under yo (take me under) wings, 
 And we can reach the (we can reach the) sky 
 (We can reach the sky) 
 Baby don't you (don't you worry) worry, 
 I'm gon help you (I'm gon help you) fly 
 (I'm gon help you fly) 
 Yo mama, don't you (take me under) worry 
 You gon reach the (we can reach the) sky 
 (We can reach the sky) 
 She's a... 
 She's a fallen angel, (hey hey) sent from heaven up above, just for me 
 She's a fallen angel, waitin for me to wrap my heart around her, know 
 (Know that she's) She's a fallen angel, makin' due with all the judgment (no) 
 I know, that she's (yeah) a fallen angel (ooh ah) 
 Baby I know 
 I know that they done hurt you 
 But I'm here 
 Let's take it all away 
 So if you let me... 
 You know what, just put your heart in my hands 
 And everything they say, I take it back 
 Like this... 
 (Reversed last verse) 
 You don't mean nothing, [reversed line] 
 I don't want ya, [reversed line] 
 I don't need ya, [reversed line] 
 Never loved ya, [reversed line] 
 You're nobody, [reversed line] 
 And'll never make it, [reversed line] 
 You're a mistake (ooh), [reversed line]
