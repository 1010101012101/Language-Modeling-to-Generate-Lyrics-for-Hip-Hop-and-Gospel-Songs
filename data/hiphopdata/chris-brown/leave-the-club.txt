I'm a make you fall in love when you leave the club 
 All I really want you to do is scream my name 
 And nobody else, 
 Just love me girl ('Cause you're bad) 
 All by yourself 
 Just love me girl 
 Who is she? 
 She gotta special type of perfume 
 And her bag balenciaga 
 It's full of tricks, look at her move 
 Damn, I feel guilty 
 'Cause I ain't offer her a seat in VIP yet 
 Girl I know you wanna drink just dance for me 
 You're not gonna regret 
 'Cause I ain't got ones all I got is hundreds 
 Girl you look so amazing when you do it 
 There's no better time to play my music, for her 
 I betcha 
 I'm a make you fall in love when you leave the club 
 All I really want you to do is scream my name 
 And nobody else, 
 Just love me girl ('Cause you're bad) 
 All by yourself 
 Just love me girl 
 I can feel you lookin' my way 
 And my body's all alone 
 You're in a daze 
 You think you're gonna take me home 
 Ya know, I'm thinking it too, it's on my mind 
 'Cause I ain't got ones all I got are hundreds 
 Don't I look so amazing when I do it? 
 Why we still wasting time let's do it 
 Get your car 
 I betcha 
 I'm a make you fall in love when you leave the club (When we leavin'?) 
 All I really want you to do is scream my name (I'm wanna scream it baby!) 
 And nobody else, 
 Just love me girl ('Cause you're bad) (So bad) 
 'Cause you're all by yourself 
 Just love me girl (I'm gonna love you) 
 Can you love me? 
 Yes, I can love you

 And baby we can do it all night, till the morning 
 I'll let you ride, like a rodeo 
 And when you ready to go I'm outside 
 I got the glasses 
 I got the liquor 
 I got the green 
 I brought the swishers 
 Yeah! 
 We're gonna have a good time 
 Yes we will! 
 I'm a make you fall in love when you leave the club 
 All I really want you to do is scream my name 
 And nobody else, 
 Just love me girl ('Cause you're bad) 
 All by yourself 
 Just love me girl
