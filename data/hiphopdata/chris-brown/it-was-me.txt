Tell me do you remember when 
 You were talkin' to your best friend 
 And she mentioned 
 There was someone, a gentleman 
 Who was trying his best to extend 
 An invitation 
 If you get to know me 
 Baby it'll be a really good thing 
 Baby no strings 
 I know it seems like I'm comin' off strong 
 I hope you don't mind spendin time 
 Jus t you and me (just you and me) 
 I know you will have a good time 
 That somebody was me 
 I'm the one that called you up 
 With the blocked id for a week 
 See I was holding back my feeling 
 Wasn't sure how you would respond to me 
 It was me girl 
 Girl I bet you remember when 
 You went out with your girls clubbin 
 And dancin yeah 
 You glanced at a gentleman 
 I got your number from your girlfriends 
 They said you was on[? ]
