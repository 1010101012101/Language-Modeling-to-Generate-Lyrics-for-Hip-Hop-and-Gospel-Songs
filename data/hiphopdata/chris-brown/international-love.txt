You put it down like New York City 
 I never sleep 
 Wild like Los Angeles 
 My fantasy 
 Hotter than Miami 
 I feel the heat 
 Oh Miss international love 
 Oh Miss international love 
 I don't play football but I've touched down pretty much all around the world, all around the world 
 I don't play baseball but I've hit a home run all around the world, all around the world 
 I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce 
 And the places on the globe I didn't know existed 
 In Romania she pulled me to the side and told me Pit you can have me and my sister 
 In Lebanon yeah the women are bomb 
 And in Greece you've guessed it the women are sweet 
 Spinned all around the world but I ain't gon' lie there's nothing like Miami's heat 
 You put it down like New York City 
 I never sleep 
 Wild like Los Angeles 
 My fantasy 
 Hotter than Miami 
 I feel the heat 
 Oh Miss international love 
 Oh Miss international love

 You put it down like New York City

 Wild like Los Angeles

 I feel the heat
