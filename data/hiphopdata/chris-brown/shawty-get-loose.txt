Hey (x3) 
 (Intro lil mama) 
 The way we get loose we move our shoulders, forward, heads, back, 
 Get it in control like janet jack, 
 Get it on the floor let 'em know what's happenin', 
 [Verse 1] (lil mama) 
 Hold up l you better ask somebody, 
 Hoppin' on my grind since butt touch potty, 
 Y'all don't really want it but da yung got time, 
 With a flow so spec like teconolic, 
 It's so sick, how the clock go tick, 
 Keep giving y'all hits like tepertic 
 Uh, 'cause the reason why I spit it, how I spit it, when I spit it, 
 It's like mucous, gotta get rid of it, 
 These chicks don't pop like me, 
 Uncompatible girl no comparing me, 
 And ain't none of y'all scaring me, 
 Like don't ya wish ya girl was as bad as me, yeah!, 
 With a flow so sick like twisters, 
 So sweet with the beat cold like a mistake, 
 Instincts come so smooth like what is it, 
 Bk h-dub...
