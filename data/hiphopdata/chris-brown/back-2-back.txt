(Chris: talks) 
 I mean come on... 
 I can't deal with it... 
 Call me back... 
 Lately 
 More and more I been feelin' some kind of way 
 And I ain't crazy 
 I know you got those texts from me 
 (Got 'em from me, whoa) 
 But it's this thing 
 That we been goin' through 
 Is somethin' wrong with you? (with you) 
 All it's doing is makin' me remember 
 How we called it quits 
 Girl I'm too young for this 
 When you... 
 When you turned away from me 
 Makes me think that I should jus leave 
 Go back to bein the same ol g 
 Girl I don't wanna lay here back to back 
 Oh i... 
 Don't want you mad at me 
 Snatchin the covers 
 Actin' like you're asleep 
 When you know you're up, no 
 Girl I don't wanna lay here back to back 
 All night long 
 I find myself tryna get away 
 And that ain't right, no 
 Lookin' through my phone 
 Tryna remember her name 
 That would only make it worse 
 We try to talk through our problems 
 But it takes more than words 
 Said it don't even bother me 
 But I swear it hurts 
 When I said I didn't wanna go through the same ish 
 This is what I meant, oh... 
 When you turned away from me 
 Makes me think that I should jus leave 
 Go back to bein the same ol g 
 Girl I don't wanna lay here back to back 
 Oh i... 
 Don't want you mad at me 
 Snatchin the covers 
 Actin' like you're asleep 
 When you know you're up, no 
 Girl I don't wanna lay here, back to back
