Oh, do you want me girl? 
 Baby love how you been doing? 
 Have you been naughty and nice baby? 
 Tell me what are we doing? 
 It's snowing on this beautiful music 
 And when I'll unwrap a present tonight, you gonna be the one, listen to me now 
 I want you to 
 Do you want me boy 
 Take it off 
 Do you want me boy 
 Girl just kiss me, Oh baby 
 Under the mistletoe 
 And we can both say Christmas came today, 
 And we can both say Christmas came today 
 Baby love, you know I'm hungry 
 Your bra and panties feel right 
 But girl I just wanna taste your cookies 
 I'll sneak and they won't hear a sound 
 I'm like oh no she come back like a yo yo 
 Girl I don't make you rain, I make you snow 
 Do you want me to stop 
 You tell me no 
 Your love is so hard that the tree fell on the floor 
 I want you to 
 Do you want me boy 
 Take it off 
 Do you want me boy 
 Girl just kiss me, Oh baby 
 Under the mistletoe 
 And we can both say Christmas came today, 
 And we can both say Christmas came today 
 I want you to 
 Do you want me boy 
 Take it off 
 Do you want me boy 
 Girl just kiss me, Oh baby 
 Under the mistletoe 
 And we can both say Christmas came today, 
 And we can both say Christmas came today
