I got my keyboard 
 Symbols all ready 
 Pull up the strings 
 And leave the bottom all heavy 
 Palms all sweaty 
 This feels like a dream 
 Little excited, you know what I mean girl 
 Girl I'm in need for a woman that can play 
 Knows how to turn it up loud 
 Anytime of the day 
 Take my CD and baby press repeat 
 It ain't no need to speak 
 Just let it play 
 Well you got my attention now 
 I can't let you down 
 Your lyrics and your sound 
 Imagine me and you 
 What we gon do (just listen) 
 But wait before the break down 
 Let's listen to some love music (love music) 
 Lay back and just let it spin 
 This music is your fan 
 Let's listen to some love music (love music) 
 Nobody has to know 
 Let's listen to some love music (love music) 
 Can't wait to get this party started 
 I'll hit the switches 
 Let me remix it 
 (Sit back) and listen to some love music 
 Turn my mic up 
 Can you loop it now 
 From the rhythm of the track 
 And it ain't gon change 
 The tempo stays the same 
 Let it flow through the music now 
 And I just want to see you smile 
 Now forgetabout what it is 
 So baby take my CD yeah 
 And baby press repeat 
 It ain't no need to speak 
 Just let it play 
 Well you got my attention now 
 I can't let you down 
 Your lyrics and your sound 
 Imagine me and you 
 What we gon do (just listen) 
 But wait before the break down 
 Let's listen to some love music (love music) 
 Lay back and just let it spin 
 This music is your fan 
 Let's listen to some love music (love music) 
 Nobody has to know 
 Let's listen to some love music (love music) 
 Can't wait to get this party started 
 I'll hit the switches 
 Let me remix it 
 (Sit back) and listen to some love music 
 Don't matter what the record is 
 Anytime it plays girl 
 My heart skips a beat 
 I feel it in my soul 
 I'm about to over load 
 It's takin' control of me 
 We're the perfect harmony 
 Let's just keep the speakers blasting 
 And I won't stop (I won't stop) 
 Till we burn out together 
 Let's listen to some love music (love music) 
 Lay back and just let it spin 
 This music is your fan 
 Let's listen to some love music (love music) 
 Nobody has to know 
 Let's listen to some love music (love music) 
 Can't wait to get this party started 
 I'll hit the switches 
 Let me remix it 
 (Sit back) and listen to some love music 
 Love love music 
 Love love love music (love music love music) 
 Love love music 
 Love love love love music (love music love music)
