Yeah (on tonight) 
 It's like I can't let you go (on tonight) 
 But I got to (on tonight) 
 I'm a change it up a lil bit, I'm a do it like this 
 We been together for a minute 
 Now it feels funny to be doing something different 
 But it's all good, me and you finished 
 She gotta ball player, but a nxgga ain't tripping 
 And I ain't saying that he don't love you 
 But I don't think he love you like I do 
 But it's okay, it's all right 
 My blackberry filled with a whole bunch of women 
 Wasting time, steady tryna get you back 
 Get you back in my life 
 Yeah you don't care, you don't care 
 It used to be you that I like but I'm a do what I like 
 Tonight, I'm goin' get tipsy 
 Over twenty one, all the girls have fun 
 And watch the ladies jump on me 
 I'm not looking for love, 'cause she's gone 
 So tell all the girls that the bottles on us 
 Get your drink on 
 I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind 
 Find a lil shawty I like 
 Girl when I'm up in the club, really turnt up 
 I ain't goin' think about you (na na na na) 
 (Aye aye aye) ain't thinking about you tonight (night night night) 
 Bow wow 
 You got the wrong one, if you think I ain't gonna go out 
 You used to be the only girl a nxgga would think about 
 I gotta couple of girls on call, I'm a bring 'em out 
 A magic city stripper, hunh, so this is what it's all about 
 I'm the club doing my two steps 
 I done pulled about eight broads already 
 I'm just getting my feet wet (damn) 
 But I ain't even knocking your style 
 See I be here all day tryna count how many girls want bow 
 Yeah I see you on the blogs with your dude and all that 
 But little do you know, you making yourself look wack 
 If dude gotta problem, better tell him to fall back 
 I'm blowing real big in vip, yeah that loud pack 
 Shxt it's me and chris in here, so you know it's real thick in here 
 Better cuff your girl because your bxtch in here 
 Tryna see how many I can fit in my lambo 
 I never go raw, stay strapped like rambo 
 I'm not looking for love, 'cause she's gone 
 So tell all the girls that the bottles on us 
 Get your drink on 
 I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind 
 Find a lil shawty I like 
 Girl when I'm up in the club, really turnt up 
 I ain't goin' think about you (na na na na) 
 (Aye aye aye) ain't thinking about you tonight (night night night)

 So tell all the girls that the bottles on us 
 Get your drink on
