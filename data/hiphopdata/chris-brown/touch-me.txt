I don't know if it's your scent or your kiss 
 But I girl I love it 
 And time after time, 
 You give me one of the greatest gifts 
 I want you to 
 I want you to love me 
 Like you never loved nobody else 
 And I want you to touch me 
 Like when your touching yourself 
 So baby come over (I'm on my way girl) 
 If you take your time 
 You can love me right 
 (Gonna love it, uh-huh, set the time girl) 
 If you want me to slow it down 
 (I do, do you, I will, will you, I will) 
 Bite into the pillow, try not to make a sound 
 Girl, it's okay, 'cause I want you to feel me, yeah 
 Cause your daddy's girl, I'm a show you how to love, 
 Show you how to love me girl 
 So lay down right there 
 So you can hold my head 
 While I'm kissing on your thighs 
 Girl I just need it one more time 
 I want you to love me 
 Like you never loved nobody else (can you do me girl) 
 And I want you to touch me 
 Like when your touching yourself 
 And as I look into your eyes 
 Your body screams for my love 
 No fear, just me, 
 And as you feel me inside 
 My passion fits like a glove 
 No more fear, just you and me 
 I want you to love me 
 Like you never loved nobody else 
 And I want you to touch me 
 Like when your touching yourself
