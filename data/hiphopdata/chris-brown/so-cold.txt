Damn I want my baby back 
 It's so cold without her 
 Cold without her 
 She's gone 
 Now I'm alone, no one to hold on 
 'Cause she was the only one 
 And I know I was dead wrong 
 But if you (ooh ooh) 
 If you 
 See her sooon 
 Ask her will she forgive me 
 If you ever see her 
 If you ever meet her 
 If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her 
 Let her know it's so cold 
 It's so cold, it's so cold 
 Here without her 
 And tell her I miss her 
 Tell her I need her 
 Tell her I want her 
 I really want her to come back home, back to keep me warm 
 Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry 
 Can you forgive me? 
 Please forgive me 
 And come back home 
 Keep me safe and warm 
 Now my baby's really gone 
 I don't know if she's coming home 
 My love's up, I fucked up 
 I know 
 Tell me what to do to get her back 
 Back where her heart belongs 
 Been gone from me for way too long 
 So if you, seen my boo 
 Please can youu 
 Can you tell her for me 
 If you ever see her 
 If you ever meet her 
 If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her 
 Let her know it's so cold (Let her know it's so cold) 
 It's so cold (Let her know it's so cold) 
 It's so cold (It's so cold here without her) 
 And tell her I miss her 
 Tell her I need her 
 Tell her I want her 
 I really want her to come back home 
 Back to keep me warm 
 Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry 
 Can you forgive me? 
 Please forgive me 
 And come back home 
 Keep me safe and warm 
 (All dem girls across the world 
 You know you gotta be my girl) x4 
 If you ever see her 
 If you ever meet her 
 If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her 
 Let her know it's so cold 
 It's so cold, it's so cold 
 Here without her
