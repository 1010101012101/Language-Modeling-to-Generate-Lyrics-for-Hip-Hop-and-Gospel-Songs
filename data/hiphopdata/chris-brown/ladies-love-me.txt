Chris Brown: 
 Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J

 And that's my Ferrari next to my Ducati 
 Call my old school Big Bertha that big body 
 Boy I get exotic, my car need a pilot 
 Get free drinks to party, yo nigga need his wallet 
 No limit to what I'm spending so I know she's 'bout it 'bout it 
 And who in the hell is smoking in here 'cause it's super cloudy 
 Goons with me, dressed like skaters, give you bruised kidneys, stretch ya later 
 Man my house so big took the escalator to the elevators took the elevator to the private jet then I jet nigga see ya later 
 Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J (yellow model chick)

 Justin Bieber: 
 Baby I'm yo doctor, I could be your rocker 
 Swagging I'm not bragging but I swear that I could rock ya 
 Baby I'm not crazy I got swag like Patrick Swayze 
 Know them haters never phase me that's not how my mama raised me 
 I am incredible this is inedible killing this track was inevitable 
 I am hetero baby you better know JB is generally just a G look at me, now 
 I said look at me, swaggin' with a crooked T 
 Body slam the beat from DB call me Booker T 
 I said whoa there, whoa there baby you just need to stop 
 I'm busy out performing and I'm going to the top 
 I've got so much to lose so I'm steady getting gwap 
 While them haters go down and we just get to watch ah 
 Amazing, I'm blazing, look over here and see that I'm amazing 
 Nobody's facing what I'm facing set a pace so I can race without pacing 
 Lace my shoes up, start racing, you can taste it without faste-ing, I mean fasting 
 Start blasting, car born hill do opt that thing 
 Swagger jacking, it's not what I do 
 JB is the man yeah he's the truth 
 He's a beast when he steps up in the booth 
 Crash landed, I did too. 
 I'm a gentleman, yes I'm a gentleman 
 I'm out of my element but I'm still elegant 
 I'm full of adrenaline you know what that means 
 Louis V high tops with the skinny jeans

 Ladies love me (yellow bottle sippin') 
 Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J (yellow Lamborghini)
