Girl you ain't acting right 
 But you're coming home tonight 
 Stop 
 Baby don't tell me no 
 You're coming home tonight 
 Stop 
 I didn't want you to go 
 But I'm not sleeping alone tonight 
 I, I, I 
 I can't stoping thinking about you baby 
 'Cause you know I love you girl 
 I might 
 Jump in my car, 'cause you drive me crazy 
 Baby just come back home 
 I'm not sleeping alone tonight 
 I'm not sleeping a lot tonight 
 I need you in my arms, oh I 
 For the rest of my life 
 So come home tonight 
 Come home, oh girl come over 
 Oh baby tonight 
 Come home, oh girl home 
 I'm not sleeping alone tonight 
 So come home tonight 
 Funny that you missed my call 
 That ass is coming home tonight 
 Your friends probably think I'm a little off 
 That's because you do me right 
 I, I, I 
 Won't stop till I find you baby 
 I'm not tired 
 'Cause your love just drives me crazy 
 Baby just come back home 
 I'm not sleeping alone tonight 
 I'm not sleeping a lot tonight 
 I need you in my arms, oh I 
 For the rest of my life 
 So come home tonight 
 Come home, oh girl come over 
 Oh baby tonight 
 Come home, oh girl home 
 I'm not sleeping alone tonight 
 So come home tonight 
 Girl why you ain't acting right 
 Why you ain't acting right 
 Baby just come back home

 I need you in my arms, oh I 
 For the rest of my life 
 So come home tonight 
 Come home, oh girl come over 
 Oh baby tonight 
 Come home, oh girl home
