Young love, love love. 
 A teenage love. 
 Young love. 
 A teenage love. 
 Young love, young love where would I be without my young love. 
 Young love. 
 A teenage love 
 Tell me what's the definition of love. 
 It seems like everybody thinks they done figured it out but every time we fall up in it, 
 They fall out in and out it again 
 Tell me how they gonna know about us tell me and you we ain't even been around long enough 
 We can prove 'em wrong, show 'em how it's done, I know that we can do it 
 'Cause it's wildin out (we got that) 
 Forgiving (we got that) 
 Just talk'n bout what we feel'n (we got that) 
 Just hanging out, keeping it real (we got that) 
 Me and you know what the deal is 
 If we ain't 21, they try and say it ain't love 
 'Cause we can't hit the club, they try and say we too young 
 I ain't saying that we trying to be grown, I'm just saying that we old enough to know 
 We got that young love, young love 
 We lucky 'cause we got that young love 
 Crazy how our friends say, that they gone?? 
 'Cause we always together, and we ain't gotta front or pretend no 
 Cause you know a couple of them gon' hate, talk behind your back, smile up in ya face 
 Girl we can prove 'em wrong show 'em how it's done and girl I know we can make just cause 
 We wildin out (we got that) 
 Forgiving (we got that) 
 Just talk'n bout what we feel'n (we got that) 
 Just hanging out, keeping it real (we got that) 
 Me and you know what the deal is 
 'Cause we ain't 21, they try and say it ain't love 
 'Cause we can't hit the club, they try and say we too young 
 I ain't saying that we trying to be grown, I'm just saying that we old enough to know 
 We got that young love, young love 
 We can hit a show, kick it on the block, anywhere we go, we know that we got that young love, younge love, young love 
 Talking on the phone, hanging at the spot, no matter what, they know they can't stop that young love, young love, young love 
 (You're my young love) 
 'Cause we ain't 21, they try and say it ain't love 
 'Cause we can't hit the club, they try and say we too young 
 I ain't saying that we trying to be grown, I'm just saying that we old enough to know 
 We got that young love, young love 
 Young love, young love everything I need I got my young love 
 Young love, young love everything I want I found in my young love
