I' traveled the world now 
 Baby I never seen nobody like you 
 Definition of my fantasy 
 You're my only dream come true 
 We gonna rock and roll 
 Nonstop, lets go 
 One shot, I know 
 This don't come around a lot 
 This the only chance I got 
 Girl, hey oh, 
 That's the sound of my heart beating just like a drum 
 Girl you know you got me strung 
 Yeah, hey oh, 
 I'm falling in love now (x2) 
 She's leaving me speechless 
 I'm trying to figure out the words to say 
 Lets erase the space between us 
 I know we can find a way 
 So lets rock and roll 
 Nonstop, lets go 
 One shot, I know 
 This don't come around a lot 
 This the only chance I got 
 Girl, hey oh, 
 That's the sound of my heart beating just like a drum 
 Girl you know you got me strung 
 Yeah, hey oh, 
 I'm falling in love now (x2) 
 Falling in love now (x4) 
 Girl, go build me up 
 But don't break me down 
 And every time you come around 
 My heart makes that sound 
 See I've been swimming in women 
 But I'm thinking now 
 You're the only one I need 
 We gonna rock and roll 
 Nonstop
