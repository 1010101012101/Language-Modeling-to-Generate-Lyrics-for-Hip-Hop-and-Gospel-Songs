Guess who stepped into the room 
 Its ya boy breezy hit em' wit that auto-tune 
 Automatic, sistimatic, robo to 'cause I want to 
 Ima kindah guy don't follow rules 
 So c'mon baby girl lets break a few 
 But let me say this 
 Hold on, are you sure you wanna play with fire 
 I'm gurenteed to take it higher, 
 If you say you don't then you're a liar, yeeaaa 
 You don't want my numba baby, you don't want m math 
 I know what you want, I know what you want 
 You don't want no picture baby or no autograph

 You wanna hit it, hit it, hit it smash 
 Hit it, hit it, hit it smash

 But all ha friends kept cock-blockin mayne

 You wanna hit it, hit it, hit it smash 
 Hit it, hit it, hit it smash 
 Hit it, hit it, hit it smash
