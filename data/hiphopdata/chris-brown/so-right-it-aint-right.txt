Girl you know I got a problem witchu, yeah 
 Cause you ain't right, no 
 Girl you ain't fair, no 
 You don't even seem to know how you be messin with me, hey 
 What am I s'pose to do 
 When all I wanna do is claim you 
 What am I s'pose to do 
 When you be lookin' the way you do 
 You don't recognize 
 There's somethin' about ya little mami 
 You don't realize

 How am I suppose to keep my cool

 Tell me what do you expect for me to do 
 Girl you're so right

 Girl you jus don't know I'm tryna be solo 
 But you're so right

 Girl you know you got me givin' up on my homies 
 And I don't go out at night 'cause we do what I like 
 I don't even seem to care about nothin' but you, ooh...

 What am I s'pose to do

 There's somethin' about ya little mami 
 You don't realize

 How am I suppose to keep my cool 
 When you be comin' 'round 
 You be hangin' out 
 Tell me what do you expect for me to do 
 Girl you're so right 
 It jus ain't right, no
