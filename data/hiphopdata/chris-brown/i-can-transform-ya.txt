Lil Wayne: 
 Go hey Lil Mama 
 I can transform ya 
 No I can't dance, but I can dance on ya 
 Swizz on the beat, Chris move ya feet 
 And baby I can transform your him to a me 
 I can change your life, make it so new 
 Make you never want to go back to the old you 
 Ciroc and lime, give it a lil time 
 And she can transform like Optimus Prime 
 Chris Brown: 
 Need a ride? 
 I can range you up 
 Money, I can change you up 
 You can ride your own 
 No longer be the passenger 
 Swag low, I build you up 
 Knees, we can stand you up 
 Red lips, red dress, like 'em like a fire truck 
 What you need, you can have that 
 My black card, they don't decline that 
 See potential in ya, let me mold that 
 I can transform ya, I can transform ya 
 I can transform ya, I can transform ya 
 Anything ya want, I can (I can) get it for ya 
 You're my baby girl 
 Shoulda known I did it for ya 
 I can trans..., I can trans..., I can transform ya 
 Shoes - you got it (got it) 
 Bags - you got it (got it) 
 Cars - you got it (got it) 
 Money - still got it (got it) 
 I can transform ya, I can transform ya 
 Anything you want I can (I can) get it for ya 
 Chris Brown: 
 See me in the video, you can have it really though 
 Iced out everything, break you like an eskimoe 
 Wanna fly, we can go, anywhere you wanna go 
 Jimmy Choos in Italy, Louis V in Tokyo 
 Something like Pinnochio 
 If you lie down, I'ma grow 
 Wanna see me do it big 
 I can show you how it goes 
 Take you from an amateur to being professional 
 I can have you swag surfing 
 What you need, you can have that 
 My black card, they don't decline that 
 See potential in ya, let me mold that 
 I can transform ya, I can transform ya 
 I can transform ya, I can transform ya 
 Anything ya want, I can (I can) get it for ya 
 You're my baby girl 
 Shoulda known I did it for ya 
 I can trans..., I can trans..., I can transform ya 
 Shoes - you got it (got it) 
 Bags - you got it (got it) 
 Cars - you got it (got it) 
 Money - still got it (got it) 
 I can transform ya, I can transform ya 
 Anything you want I can (I can) get it for ya 
 Lil Wayne: 
 Alright, 
 I can transform ya, like a transformer 
 I can turn you from a human to a Carter 
 Take you off the bench, t-turn ya to a starter 
 Then take you home and put you on a charger 
 Then-then my car transforms to a charter 
 And we can fly to wherever you ever-ever thought of 
 I take you to where it's warmer 
 Then i gotta rip off your dress like a warm up 
 But I'm just getting warmed up 
 So tell your man he better get his Voltron up 
 I transform her to a Ducati 
 And then I transform me to a Bugatti 
 'Cause her form puts me in a trance 
 I transform smaller and she puts me in her pants 
 Swizz-Swizz on the Beat, Chris move ya feet 
 And Weezy transform a good girl to a freak 
 I can transform ya, I can (I can) transform ya 
 Anything ya want, I can (I can) get it for ya 
 You're my baby girl 
 Shoulda known I did it for ya 
 I can trans..., I can trans..., I can transform ya 
 Shoes - you got it (got it) 
 Bags - you got it (got it) 
 Cars - you got it (got it) 
 Money - still got it (got it) 
 I can transform ya, I can transform ya 
 Anything you want I can (I can) get it for ya (C'mon Chris)
