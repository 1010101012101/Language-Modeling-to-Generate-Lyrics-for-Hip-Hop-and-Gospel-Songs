Hahaha... 
 Y'all wanna learn y'all abcs... 
 Abc 
 Haha [x3] 
 Y'all gon like this right (here) 
 There are so many ways to spell it out 
 I love you 
 But only one way to show you 
 (One way to show you) 
 I can scare the mountain 
 Yell it out till my face turn blue 
 But when I come back down what did that prove 
 (All that, what did it prove?) 
 I would rather let, my day to day[? ] 
 Actions speak louder than what I say 
 But if I had to pick the letters from the alphabetbet 
 I would say it this way 
 "A" maybe we can "b" something you can "c" "def"initely 
 I know you want a "g" who can take you "hi" higher than a "j" 
 What I'm tryna say 
 Is love is as simple as abc 
 All you gotta do is sing with me 
 Since I made it clear 
 You understand I wanna be with you 
 All I wanna know is if it's cool 
 Now it would hurt me so if you said I know 
 'Cause I be on my "p"s and "q"s 
 And I've "x"ed all the rest 
 This man's only got eyes for y-o-u 
 I would rather let, my day to day[? ]
