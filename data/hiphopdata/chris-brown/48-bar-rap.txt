Yeah, it go. 
 It's what they wanted right? 
 Black shades, dark tent 
 Yo girl, nxgga I get it in 
 Stick shiftin, switchin and burnin out in the benz 
 Wood grippin, kissing all of their model friends 
 Mr dolo, with a bunch of freaks 
 And you know they get the party bouncing like a pogo 
 I'm in (slow mode) 
 But fast forward me to the part where me and yo girl underneath the sheets 
 Just keep yo eyes on, gotta whole bunch of nxggas behind me wearing red, verizon 
 New money, I get my super size on 
 I like a long hair, bad chick, (???) long 
 Haha, knowing all the words to my songs 
 And she fxcking every girl that's on my phone 
 Haha, I'm, I'm so fly; flight models up 'cause I'm so high 
 Ha, lil nxgga get your cheese up 
 Black ice on my neck, make you freeze up 
 Oh you worry about me, go figure 
 I ain't sweating it, fxck them old nxggas 
 Lambo, range rove, with my pants low 
 I got the audience clapping like a backboard 
 She put her hands up, and then I stand up 
 And getting to working on the pole, like a dancer 
 I double up, I call it double dutch 
 Two girls at one time, what the fxck 
 Rabbit foot in the air, cause my luck is up 
 Bring the first eight out, 'cause I'm cutting up 
 Bang bang, now that's some g shit 
 No chain gang, like I'm really on some free shit 
 Their jaw dropped, I'm leaving nxggas speechless 
 World premiere, get a sneak peek bxtch 
 I'm great, today is a new day 
 Fxcking with me, do the moon walk on your face 
 No games, I'm oh so serious 
 And y'all nxggas are straight pxssy, period 
 They say a singer can't rap, I ain't hearing it 
 Cause after these couple songs, I been killing shxt 
 Oh no, nxggas saying I'm loco 
 But they pinocchio nxggas, watch their nose grow 
 Its young money, shouts out my nxgga tyga too 
 They on their first mixtape, I'm on volume two 
 Turn me up, I'll show you what a tiger do 
 And imma rip this beat up like lion food 
 Louie luggage, and the case for the passport 
 I don't buy shxt, nxgga I ask for it 
 I'm the freshest, I'm the best 
 I suggest that I get it off my mother fxcking chest
