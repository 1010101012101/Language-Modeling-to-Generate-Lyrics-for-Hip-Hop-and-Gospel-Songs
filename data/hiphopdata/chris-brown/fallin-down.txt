Sometimes I don't wanna wake up alone 
 But sometimes I wanna wake up and be on my own 
 Sometimes I don't want to walk by and smile 
 But at the same time I don't wanna let people down 
 Can you imagine, weight of a world 
 Placed on your shoulders, trapt in this world 
 And no one can reach you, ooh 
 So no one can help you, now 
 It's gettin' heavy I think I'm bout' ready to breakdown 
 I'm standin' up, but I'm fallin' down 
 Time keeps on tickin' I wish there was a way to slow it down 
 Some one pick me up, 'cause I'm fallin' down 
 Fallin' down, down, down, down 
 Fallin' down, down, down, down 
 Why is it so easy for you to blame 
 I'm only human were all the same 
 I've givin' up everything in exchange of being alone 
 Shakin' these demons underneath all my pride, no 
 Can you imagine, weight of a world 
 Placed on your shoulders, trapt in this world 
 And no one can reach you, ooh 
 So no one can help you, now 
 It's gettin' heavy I think I'm bout' ready to breakdown 
 I'm standin' up, but I'm fallin' down 
 Time keeps on tickin' I wish there was a way to slow it down 
 Some one pick me up, 'cause I'm fallin' down 
 Fallin' down, down, down, down 
 Fallin' down, down, down, down 
 Fallin' down, down, down, down 
 Fallin' down, down, down, down 
 It's gettin' heavy I think I'm bout' ready to breakdown 
 I'm standin' up, but I'm fallin' down 
 Time keeps on tickin' I wish there was a way to slow it down 
 Some one pick me up, 'cause I'm fallin' down 
 It's gettin' heavy I think I'm bout' ready to breakdown 
 I'm standin' up, but I'm fallin' down 
 Time keeps on tickin' I wish there was a way to slow it down 
 Some one pick me up, 'cause I'm fallin' down 
 Fallin' down, down, down, down 
 Fallin' down, down, down, down 
 Fallin' down, down, down, down 
 Fallin' down, down, down, down
