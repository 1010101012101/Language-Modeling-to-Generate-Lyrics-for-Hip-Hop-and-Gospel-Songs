Women lie, men lie, 
 Women lie, men lie, 
 Women lie, men lie, 
 Numbers don't lie, 
 Women lie, men lie, 
 Women lie, men lie, 
 Say what you want but the pockets don't lie, 
 Women lie, men lie, 
 Women lie, men lie, 
 Women lie, men lie,

 OK you know the name, so you know the drill, 
 Ain't singing candy rain, but I'm so fo real, 
 You know like my love do you ever dream of candy coated rain drops pouring down high loves, 
 And I'm all about my Gualas, 
 Even though they say more money more problems, 
 But I don't picture me going on no job hunt, 
 Money pillin' up now that's somethin' to be proud of, 
 Yeah I'm killin' 'em, but it's not my fault, 
 'Cause I've been on my grind, ha Tony Hawk, 
 And them rims are 28's, Marshall Faulk, 
 My lyrics murderin' niggas I need the white chalk. 
 Women lie, men lie,

 Say what you want but the pockets don't lie, 
 I'm on Patron and Hypnotic, this Gucci on my body, 
 And I'm big, big drippin' and dippin' Kawasaki, 
 Got more kicks than karate, than your son Mr. Miyagi, 
 I'm hotter than wasabi, Bet bet better yet Mohavi, 
 I'm all about my money so my cash never fold, 
 They be like why you shittin' on 'em? 
 'Cause Imma asshole, 
 Everywhere I go I be followed by six hoes, 
 And my checks got a one comma followed by six O's, 
 Women lie, men lie, 
 Go ahead touch it, 
 Money talkin' if you ain't talkin' big bucks hush it, up, 
 Duck, 'cause I'm blowin' up, 
 Pockets off that muscle milk, boy that swole is fuck 
 Women lie, men lie,
