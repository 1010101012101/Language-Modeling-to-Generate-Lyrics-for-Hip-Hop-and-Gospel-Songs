Shawty, swing my way, put that ass all in my face 
 Round and round above my head, swing that ass like a chandelier 
 Baby you've been on that pole too long, too long 
 And girl I'm tryna take you home 
 I ain't tryna play with it, if you want it come get it 
 It ain't nobody business what I'm 'bout to do with it 
 Can I leave with you girl? 
 I won't waste your time 
 Girl I gotta tell you what's been on my mind 
 Oh 
 Can we stick it in a little bit? 
 Don't be shy, just a little bit 
 Sex and Hennessey, get you wet just a little bit (oh) 
 You ain't gotta stay the night, you can leave in a little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit 
 I hope you well rested now 
 'Cause I'm a eat it up, make sure you work that mouth 
 Girl I heard you got the best head, you know my girl's locked up 
 We gon' turn this party up at her best friend's house, everybody got me tipping 
 She told me that she got a twin and I just wanna put the tip in a little bit 
 I ain't tryna play with it, if you want it come get it 
 It ain't nobody business what I'm 'bout to do with it 
 Can I leave with you girl? 
 I won't waste your time 
 Girl I gotta tell you what's been on my mind 
 Can we stick it in a little bit? 
 Don't be shy, just a little bit 
 Sex and Hennessey, get you wet just a little bit 
 You ain't gotta stay the night, you can leave in a little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit 
 Oh baby, scream my name, put that pussy in my face 
 Wrap your legs around my head, swing that ass like a chandelier 
 Baby you've been alone too long, too long 
 Baby girl I gotta break you off 
 Can we stick it in a little bit? 
 Don't be shy, just a little bit 
 Sex and Hennessey, get you wet just a little bit 
 You ain't gotta stay the night, you can leave in a little bit, little bit, little bit, little bit 
 I just wanna stick it in a little bit
