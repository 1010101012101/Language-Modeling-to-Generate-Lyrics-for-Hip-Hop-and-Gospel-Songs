 Baby, does he do it for you? 
 When he's finished, does he step back and adore you? 
 I just gotta know, 'cause your time is money and I won't let him waste it 
 Oh no no, owww 
 Baby, just go with it 
 'Cause when you're with me I can't explain it 
 It's just different

 He's so replaceable 
 You're worth the chase you're putting on 
 It's all right, I'm not dangerous 
 When you're mine, I'll be generous 
 You're irreplaceable, a collectible 
 Just like fine china 
 Baby, you're my favorite. 
 It's like all the girls around me don't have faces. 
 And the saying goes 
 "Life is just a game" but I'm not playin', whoa. 
 He's so replaceable 
 You're worth the chase, you're good enough

 When you're mine, I'll be generous 
 You're irreplaceable, a collectible 
 Just like fine china 
 It's all right I'm not dangerous 
 When you're mine, I'll be generous 
 You're irreplaceable, a collectible 
 Just like fine china 
 Took me awhile to find your love 
 Ain't no amount of time in this world 
 Save me a lot of time and just love 
 Feel it, baby, feel it in your soul 
 Are you ready? 
 I know your heart's been telling you you belong to me, ah nah nah no. 
 It's all right, I'm not dangerous 
 When you're mine, I'll be generous 
 You're irreplaceable, a collectible, 
 Just like fine china
