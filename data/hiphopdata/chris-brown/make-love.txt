 Lil mama what you doin' ? wassup? 
 'Cause I ain't gotta work this weekend 
 Let's get up, up, up, up 
 And I jus wanna dance and play a little bit 
 And baby I'm the man and shawty you the shit 
 Think about it we can do something nasty 
 While I got my energy up all in the club 
 With the lights down low 
 And I got you 
 Tipsy and you're all up on me pullin all my clothes 
 I ain't finished my drink but I want sum more 
 Girl get your purse let me grab my coat 
 Got my keys so now we can roll back to the crib 
 I wanna make love to my baby 
 Do it all day and we can do it all night long (shawty) 
 I'm gunna make love to my baby 
 Have it you way but I like it with the lights on 
 Imma make love to my baby 
 Girl get on top of me and imma let you take it off 
 Tonight is your night 
 Baby So imma love you down 
 (Tyga) 
 All I think about when she not around 
 If I get to see her I'm gonna take her down 
 Pull your tights down throw 'em on the couch 
 Like pussy I put it in your mouth 
 Take your top off ain't no body round 
 Run around butt naked this my house 
 All these thoughts on my mind I gotta get them out 
 Tryin' but I can't figure out 
 Remember in high school I used to skip class just to sex you 
 Homeroom was the only place I could call you 
 Now it's like every time I call never get through 
 That bullshit that we been through 
 Dam I miss you 
 It's like you kick a nigga out 
 Moved on to the next one 
 I hope maybe we can work it out 
 Dam I be wishin you was here right now 
 I wanna make love to my baby 
 Do it all day and we can do it all night long (shawty) 
 I'm gunna make love to my baby 
 Have it you way but I like it with the lights on 
 Imma make love to my baby 
 Girl get on top of me and imma let you take it off 
 Tonight is your night 
 Baby So imma love you down 
 (Chirs Brown) 
 Kissin' on your body layin on top me 
 From the bed to the ground imma go down 
 Doin' my thing tell me when to stop 
 Girl I wanna see what you all about 
 Sweatin like a sauna 
 Put that dick on ya all night 
 While I got my energy up all the the club 
 With the lights down low and I got you 
 Tipsy and your all up on me pullin all my clothes 
 I ain't finished my drink but I want some more 
 Girl get your purse lemme grab my coat 
 Got my keys so now we can roll back to the crib 
 I wanna make love to my baby 
 Do it all day and we can do it all night long (shawty)

 Imma make love to my baby 
 Girl get on top of me and imma let you take it off 
 Tonight is your night 
 Baby So imma love you down
