Up, high, down, low 
 I be anywhere you want 
 Not the one for slipping, 
 But I'm sliding in yo Mary go 
 Round like the size of them wheels that's on a Chevy though 
 Ass so retarded, the homies calling you radio 
 I get it on the floor 
 When I beat I do my dougie though 
 Gorilla, yes I am aka Mr. ma-Mighty Joe 
 Simon says do this & I say do that 
 I'm hoping out that whip. 
 While yo chick saying who that 
 It's the way I gotta be 
 It's not changing 
 Hella girls in front of me 
 But I'm choosing 
 If you think you can handle me, 
 Then get in here now 
 And baby gimme what you ga-got 
 Ill show you all the goods and ill turn you out 
 Don't be acting like you don't want it now 
 Lemme apologize cause imma wear you out 
 I get around, I get around (I do that) x3 
 I get, I get, I get, I get 
 I get around, I get around (I do that) x4

 She got swagg, swagg, swagg like... 
 No photos, look at her frame 
 Bentley two those, switchin up lanes 
 Hit the airport we switchin up planes, planes, planes like... 
 I get around, I get around (I do that) x3 
 I get, I get, I get, I get 
 I get around, I get around (I do that) x4 
 I get around, I get around (I do that) x3 
 I get, I get, I get, I get 
 I get around, I get around (I do that) x4
