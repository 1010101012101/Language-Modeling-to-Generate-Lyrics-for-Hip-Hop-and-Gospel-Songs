Yeah (x5) 
 Yeah (x5) 
 Baby won't you just listen 
 Please 
 I never really thought I'd be sittin' here all alone 
 Starin' down at the phone, damn 
 What did I do that was so wrong 
 And girl I never thought that you would move on 
 Can't believe you're gone 
 It's killing me my heart ain't your home 
 (And Now) 
 Thought I was the one but you done left me out 
 (And Now) 
 And Now 
 Now I can't see nothing 
 Now my everything done turned to nothing 
 What can I do, what can I say 
 Nothin' 
 Wish I could've stopped you walkin' out 
 Should've screamed out loud 
 Baby can't you hear me (Can't you hear me) 
 Don't you diss me 
 Because I'm hurting girl I wish that you could feel me 
 I guess there's nothing 
 Wish that you would talk to me or something 
 But you ain't sayin' nothin', no 
 I never even gave you one hundred percent 
 I never said that I meant, damn girl 
 I never thought you would burn out 
 Now my heart is breaking down 
 It's killing me I can't save it 
 And it's gone 
 Thought I was the one but you done left me out 
 And now 
 Now I can't see nothing 
 Now my everything done turned to nothing 
 What can I do, what can I say 
 Nothin' 
 Wish I could've stopped you walkin' out 
 Should've screamed out loud 
 Baby can't you hear me (Can't you hear me) 
 Don't you diss me 
 Because I'm hurting girl I wish that you could feel me 
 I guess there's nothing 
 Wish that you would talk to me or something 
 But you ain't sayin' nothin', no 
 One of the things I miss most 
 Is how you made me feel so right 
 (And even though you're gone) 
 I'm all alone 
 (?) 
 Day and night 
 (?) 
 I'm breaking down 
 (?) 
 Next to me 
 Can't you see 
 (?) 
 I don't know 
 And now 
 And now 
 Now I can't see nothing 
 Now my everything done turned to nothing 
 What can I do, what can I say 
 Nothin' 
 Wish I could've stopped you walkin' out 
 Should've screamed out loud 
 Baby can't you hear me (Can't you hear me) 
 Don't you miss me 
 Because I'm hurting girl I wish that you could feel me 
 I guess there's nothing 
 Wish that you would talk to me or something 
 Now I can't see nothing 
 Now my everything done turned to nothing 
 What can I do, what can I say 
 Nothin' 
 Wish I could've stopped you walkin' out 
 Should've screamed out loud
