I picked up the paper and the headline reads 
 It says "single broken hearted in some satin sheets" 
 And I'm like why, we had a hell of a time 
 When I first met you I told ya 
 That you'll be safe 
 In the midst arguing something 
 Falls to the floor and breaks. 
 But when you looked down to see 
 What you dropped 
 Ooh it's your heart 
 Shawty is caught up 
 From a long night 
 She's ready to fall but 
 See if it's all right 
 That's just something that can happen 
 When you put it down 
 See she's caught up 
 That's not my fault right 
 See the momma called me to release steam 
 She said my daughter wont eat and she don't sleep 
 She just cries, 'cause you're in her mind 
 When I first met you I told ya 
 That you'll be safe 
 In the midst arguing something 
 Falls to the floor and breaks. 
 But when you looked down to see 
 What you dropped 
 Ooh it's your heart 
 Shawty is caught up 
 From a long night 
 She's ready to fall but 
 See if it's all right 
 That's just something that can happen 
 When you put it down 
 See she's caught up 
 That's not my fault right 
 Break it down 
 Pharrel: 
 Get down to the floor (fo sho) 
 Feel the beat, get down to the floor (hell yeah) 
 Feel the beat, get down to the floor (fo sho) 
 Feel the beat, get down to the floor (hell yeah) 
 Feel it all ova ya (yeah) 
 Feel it all ova ya (yeah) 
 Feel it all ova ya (yeah) 
 Feel it all ova ya (yeah) 
 If you just keep it in stride 
 You should be all right 
 And if you take what's inside 
 [?]And then stack with pride[?](instead) 
 Nothing along people are gone 
 When you call 
 Gurl tell me why 
 When I first met you I told ya 
 That you'll be safe 
 In the midst arguing something 
 Falls to the floor and breaks. 
 But when you looked down to see 
 What you dropped 
 Ooh it's your heart
