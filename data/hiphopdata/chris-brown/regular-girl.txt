(Verse: tyga) 
 Picture life in the movie frame 
 Smiles in your face but every body fake 
 Tryna claim a role, acting on the stage 
 The world wanna show and we all the play 
 Just to say, why didn't you want me yesterday 
 I blacked out, got some change, now they feeling me 
 Couple chains, gold chains on, mr tee 
 They see me low key so nxgga don't bother me 
 I wanna relax with some time, all just for me 
 Cause lately I been meeting girls, chasing me 
 Wanted the spotlight, damn she spotted me 
 Dang you bad baby, let me tell you one thing 
 Chris brown and tyga: 
 You got it (I like how you ?) 
 And I need it (I really, really want it) 
 Can I get (oh) 
 Your love 
 Girl I'm on it (I'm really, really on it) 
 Till morning (I be up in the morning) 
 What I gotta do to make you (I just want this) 
 I want a regular girl 
 Want a regular girl [x2] 
 I want a regular girl 
 Want a regular girl [x2] 
 I want a regular girl 
 Want a regular girl [x2] 
 I want a regular girl, when I get home yeaa 
 (Verse: chris brown) 
 The fame don't mean nothing, neither does the money 
 I just want my friend right here with me 
 The light will fade away, no matter how hard I grind 
 Today ain't the day, so I'm just gonna live my life 
 All day long, same shit different video 
 All them silly games, I don't wanna play no more 
 Chris brown and tyga: 
 You got it (I like how you ?) 
 And I need it (I really, really want it) 
 Can I get (oh) 
 Your love 
 Girl I'm on it (I'm really, really on it) 
 Till morning (I be up in the morning) 
 What I gotta do to make you (I just want this) 
 I want a regular girl 
 Want a regular girl [x2] 
 I want a regular girl 
 Want a regular girl [x2] 
 I want a regular girl 
 Want a regular girl [x2] 
 I want a regular girl, when I get home yeaa
