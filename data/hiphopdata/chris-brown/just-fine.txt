Heey, uh, ummmm, heey, oh girl, oh girl 
 We did everything we could do 
 To try to maake it work (we did, we did) 
 Baby, you look so confused, cause it feels like, there was no way we could lose (no way, no way) 
 Baby, I just don't reply 'cause I can't find the things you need in me (I can't, I can't girl) 
 Baby, they know just know what to say, the trying to break us away from one another, but maybe their right for a change 
 I think, God will give you 
 Someone, much better 
 Than me, trust me your eyes will be o.k. it will be all right. 
 You'll be just fine (just fine, just fine) 
 I know that baby we would disagree constitly on the basic things (we did, we did) 
 You thought that there was someone else, all along (no way, no way) 
 Baby I, want ? to decide ? by his side (I can't, I can't) 
 Baby, they know just what to say. 
 They wanna keep us away from one another 
 But Maybe they're right for a change 
 I think, God will give you 
 Someone, much better 
 Than me, trust me your eyes will be 
 O.k.(o.k.), all right (all right), just fine (just fine) 
 I know, baby baby can't you see that another fella just may be the kinda man you need 
 Baby you desvere it and I know that 
 I know another love has come your way, just listen to me when I say 
 You earned it (you earned it) 
 I think, God will give you 
 Someone, much better 
 Than me, trust me your eyes will be 
 O.k., it will all right, it will be just fine (just fine)
