I can't forgive 
 From the moment that I so you 
 I melted 'n' fell in love with you 
 But you need to understand 
 That a guy needs some time 
 To figure out 
 What he's gonna do with a girl like you 
 No I can't forgive the things that you do 
 When you say to me that you love me to 
 You see what I don't get 
 Is how you say them things 
 And go and do all those stupid things 
 You need to see that I 
 I'm in love with you 
 But I know 
 That you'll realize the truth 
 When I decide the right thing to do 
 Is decide, to walk out on you 
 I can't give any more 
 Of this heartache to you 
 You know that if you change 
 I will forgive you 
 If you listen to what I'm saying to you 
 You will realize what I say is true 
 Chorus (twice) 
 No I can't forgive the things that you do 
 When you say to me that you love me to 
 You see what I don't really get 
 Is how you say them things 
 And go and do all those stupid things 
 You slept with another guy 
 N I forgive u 
 You said that I was a bore 
 N I forgive you 
 You said that I was crazy 
 N I forgive you 
 You did it all again 
 I'm getting rid of u 
 Don't even try 'n' call me on ma phone 
 'Cause ill reject it 
 Don't even go and try 'n' text me 
 'Cause ill delete it 
 Its time for 2 change, N respect me 
 I'm getting rid of you, and that's the end of it
