Aye baby 
 I don't like the way you got me feelin' lately, oh 
 They say baby 
 I'm feelin' like you found someone to replace me 
 Do you remember you used to say 
 That you would never walk away 
 'Cause I remember the time and a place 
 Like it was just yesterday 
 Baby had me (gone gone gone) 
 But you won't have me (I'm gone gone gone) 
 Say no more 'cause I know what you came for 
 Just wanna play them games girl 
 So hard, to be let down (it's so hard baby to be let down baby) 
 Tell me you won't do this to me 
 We've come to far (we've come to far baby) 
 To give up now (to give up now baby) 
 Girl that's just the way it should be (Girl) 
 Say it with me babe 
 Say it with me (x4) 
 Hey baby 
 Yeah you're crazy 
 But you ain't that crazy about me 
 Cause you think that you can get whatever you want 
 So you lie and you try to play me 
 Say lady, you're cold, you're poison to me 
 And I know 
 Do you remember you used to say 
 That you would never walk away 
 'Cause I remember the time and a place 
 Like it was just yesterday 
 Baby had me (gone gone gone) 
 But you won't have me (I'm gone gone gone) 
 Say no more 'cause I know what you came for 
 Just wanna play them games girl 
 So hard, to be let down (it's so hard baby to be let down baby) 
 Tell me you won't do this to me 
 We've come to far (we've come to far baby) 
 To give up now (to give up now baby) 
 Girl that's just the way it should be (Girl) 
 Say it with me babe 
 Say it with me (x4)
