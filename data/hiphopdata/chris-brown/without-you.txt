If you had a choice then 
 What would you choose, to do. 
 I can live without money, 
 I can live without the fame and 
 If every day was sunny I can live 
 Without the rain and if I ever went 
 Up to heaven I will fall right back 
 Down that life wouldn't be living, 
 Cause your the one I couldn't live without. 
 If I couldn't blink will I still 
 Be able to see you. 
 I couldn't imagine (ooohoo) 
 Without arms could I reach, 
 No way could I ever hold you (ohohooo) 
 I need these things, like I need you, 
 If you had a choice what would you choose. 
 I can live without money, I can live without 
 The fame and if every day was sunny 
 I can live without the rain and if I ever 
 Went up to heaven I will fall right back 
 Down that life wouldn't be living, 
 Cause your the one I couldn't live without. 
 If I couldn't dream would I believe 
 That there can be a you and me and 
 If I couldn't sing would you be able 
 To hear my melody, I know that somethings 
 Wrong and I'm afraid that your moving on, 
 How can I fly when you're my wings. 
 I need these things, like I need you, 
 If you had a choice what would you choose. 
 I can live without money, I can live 
 Without the fame and if every day was sunny 
 I can live without the rain and 
 If I ever went up to heaven 
 I will fall right back down 
 That life wouldn't be living, 
 Cause your the one I couldn't live without. 
 You can take it all from me, 
 And it wouldn't mean anything, 
 Turn the whole world against me 
 As long as you don't leave. 
 It's getting hard for me to sleep, 
 Even harder for me to breath. 
 I'm used to life with you, 
 Tell me what I need to do. 
 I can live without money, I can live 
 Without the fame and if every day 
 Was sunny I can live without the rain and 
 If I ever went up to heaven 
 I will fall right back down 
 That life wouldn't be living, 
 Cause your the one I couldn't live without. 
 I can live without money, I can live 
 Without the fame and if every day 
 Was sunny I can live without the rain and 
 If I ever went up to heaven 
 I will fall right back down 
 That life wouldn't be living, 
 Cause your the one I couldn't live without.
