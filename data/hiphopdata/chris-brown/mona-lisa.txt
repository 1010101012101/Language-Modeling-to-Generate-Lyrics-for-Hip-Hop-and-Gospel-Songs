(Chris Brown) 
 Girl you wanna play with me baby 
 Money ain't a thing 'cause I got paper 
 I'm looking at your body 
 You about to get exactly what you came for 
 Now I can throw it up throw it up 
 Break it down down down 
 Even if it ain't loud she gets me aroused 
 Slow it up slow it up slow it down 
 You the shit you the shit 
 Go ahead play with it baby 
 'Cause I'ma keep my hands to myself 
 And my back on the wall 
 Now I'm playing with it baby 
 I know you don't give a fuck 
 Cause you gon' get your money up 
 I, I, I 
 Get your ass up on that pole 
 Get this money in my hand 
 I, I, I 
 All this money dripping on you 
 Like paint from a Mona Lisa 
 Drop it to the flo' bitch 
 All this money dripping on you 
 Like paint from a Mona Lisa 
 (Kevin McCall) 
 I fucked with my first bitch 
 I upgrade my second broad 
 Corporate my credit card 
 Vintaged out my fucking watch 
 Vintaged out my fucking cars 
 No... just fucking yacht 
 Your new bitch, my old bitch 
 You can have the hoe 'cause she talk a lot 
 Now get your ass up on this pole, you can get this money 
 Now I got them carats, I got all them playboy bunnies 
 I'm throwing them honies 
 Racks on top of racks and they backs look like... 
 (Chris Brown) 
 And they ass big as some mountain 
 Put my drink on it, she cold 
 My zipper down but my money up 
 Better get your ass up on that pole 
 Two mo' shots then I'm out, black, black then I reload 
 Got might earn 20 more, get yo ass up on that pole 
 Damn look at like Keisha getting that money just like a zesta 
 All of these bunnies hopping and popping 
 You fighting to get up in my 2 seater 
 My chain, 6 rings 
 Bitch, I'm in the mo'fuckin' game 
 I, I, I 
 Get your ass up on that pole 
 Get this money in my hand 
 I, I, I 
 All this money dripping on you 
 Like paint from a Mona Lisa 
 Drop it to the flo' bitch 
 All this money dripping on you 
 Like paint from a Mona Lisa 
 I don't make it rain 
 Nigga I make a monsoon like a tidal wave 
 Me taking 23 shots, that's an MJ 
 I mean a fadeaway, we 'bout to fadeaway 
 She said she like my pants 
 I think she like my pockets 
 B!tch I'm in the building counting millions 
 You should try it 
 Yeah what d'you mean 
 She tried to kiss me, I said stop it 
 Put that money in the face then she get that pussy popping 
 I, I, I 
 Get your ass up on that pole 
 Get this money in my hand 
 I, I, I 
 All this money dripping on you 
 Like paint from a Mona Lisa 
 Drop it to the flo' bitch 
 All this money dripping on you 
 Like paint from a Mona Lisa
