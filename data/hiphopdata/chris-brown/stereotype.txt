Why are my hands 
 Bleeding, I think I know why 
 Been holding on to the words from your every lie 
 Fool me once, shame on you baby 
 Fool me twice, should've known that it would problems 
 Girl with you, but I thought 
 You would be brave, my baby 
 Now I see you're just like the rest 
 Thought you would be brave, my baby 
 You've become my biggest regret 
 I really hate to label you a stereotype 
 I really hate to label you a stereotype 
 I really hate to label you a stereotype 
 I really hate to label you a stereotype 
 Stereotype, stere-stereotype 
 Stereotype, stere-stereotype 
 Stereotype, stere-stereotype 
 Stereotype, stere-stere-ere-ere-o 
 Can't blame you 
 You were only being yourself 
 Fell in love, with someone that I barely knew 
 Fool me once, shame on you baby 
 Fool me twice, should've known that it would problems 
 Girl with you, but I thought 
 You would be brave, my baby 
 Now I see you're just like the rest 
 Thought you would be brave, my baby 
 You've become my biggest regret 
 I really hate to label you a stereotype 
 I really hate to label you a stereotype 
 I really hate to label you a stereotype 
 I really hate to label you a stereotype 
 Stereotype, stere-stereotype 
 Stereotype, stere-stereotype 
 Stereotype, stere-stereotype 
 Stereotype, stere-stere-ere-ere-o 
 You would be brave, my baby 
 Now I see you're just like the rest 
 Thought you would be brave, my baby 
 You've become my biggest regret 
 I really hate to label you a stereotype 
 I really hate to label you a stereotype 
 I really hate to label you a stereotype 
 I really hate to label you a stereotype
