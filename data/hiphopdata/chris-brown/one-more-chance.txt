1st verse: 
 Came here tonight, 
 Knew I would see you, 
 But I, Wasn't quite ready for it (no), 
 These feelings I can't ignore ('cause), 
 The two of us are over, 
 But I'm not sure if I'm over you, 
 Baby I, made a mistake, 
 When I up and walked away, Now 
 I wish I had one more chance, 
 One more chance to tell you, Baby I know better, cause now I see that you are the girl (one more chance), 
 One more chance to show you, 
 How much I still love you, 
 Too bad love is over, 'cause I wish I had one, 
 2nd: 
 One more night, 
 To talk late on the phone, 
 (One more), One more smiley face, 
 Like the ones that you put on the bottom of your notes (OH), one more touch, one more hug 
 (Don't even talk about a kiss), 
 I can't help but reminisce 'cause, 
 3rd: 
 Baby oh baby I know I stated we needed some time apart, 
 But what I see in you has got me on a mission, I'm just wishin, 
 Maybe just maybe you'll realize and you'll let me back in your heart, 
 I'm at your mercy, Ooh girl I wish I had oneeeee,
