Wussup with this use 
 2 kick it on the regular 
 But since the deal u 
 Say my life has changed 
 I remember 
 When we use 2 argue 
 And it make no sense 
 Afterwards 
 We'd make love again 
 That was way 
 Before the videos 
 Way before 
 The number 1 singles 
 On the radio late night 
 At the studio 
 When I was just CB 
 Nobody knew me 
 But you were still 
 The same now 
 Being without you 
 Is like having nothing 
 It don't matter 
 'Bout the money 
 I spend I 
 Got a million plus 
 In my bank account 
 But it's nothing 
 Without you 
 Nothing without you 
 I ain't been the same 
 Since you came 
 In my life 
 And you're the only 1 
 To help me get right 
 And the way 
 I'm feeling girl 
 You need 2 know 
 Without you 
 Life is back 2 zero 
 Baby jus' listen 
 Girl it's just a job 
 So don't look 
 At me different 
 Looking in your heart 
 Girl 
 I know your committed 
 And what I told you 
 Stands true 
 I've been down for u 
 Baby 
 That was way 
 Before the videos 
 Way before 
 The number 1 singles 
 On the radio late night 
 At the studio 
 When I was just CB 
 Nobody knew me 
 Girl 
 You were just the same 
 Being without you 
 Is like having nothing 
 It don't matter 
 'Bout the money 
 I spend I 
 Got a million plus 
 In my bank account 
 But it's nothing 
 Without you 
 Nothing without you 
 I ain't been the same 
 Since you came 
 In my life 
 And you're the only 1 
 That help me get right 
 And the way 
 I'm feeling girl 
 You need 2 know 
 Without you 
 Life is back 2 zero
