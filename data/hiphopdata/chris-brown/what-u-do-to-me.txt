I want sombody I can call my wifey 
 And I want somebody to make a history with 
 And I think you that fittin that profile 
 I got something good I think I'm gonna hold on now 
 Baby you doin' good things for me 
 I ain't neva felt like this before 
 Got my feet planted on the floor 
 And I ain't goin' nowhere 
 I'm here because I care 
 Your perfect everywhere from your feet up to your hair 
 Course 
 And I'm lucky 'cause you're with me 
 Can't you see what do too me 
 Ya make me smile 
 I feel so wild 
 Right here and now I gotta say that I love u
