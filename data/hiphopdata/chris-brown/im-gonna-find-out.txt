What are you thinkin' 
 I know you see ya cell phone blinkin 
 Backwards and forwards I'm pacin' 
 Tryna figure out 
 Why you ain't callin me back 
 What does it all mean 
 Maybe ya tryna show me somethin' 
 But chu ain't gotta do it this way no 
 Put yaself in my shoes 
 Tell what would you do 
 She know ain't been gettin' her on the phone 
 And I know she been gettin' it somethins wrong 
 Could it be 
 That she's with the other dude from her past 
 I know damn well that she ain't 
 See her laughin' with her girlfriends 
 Lookin' at the number 
 Talkin' 'bout it's him again 
 I know she soulda called me 
 Pretty soon I'm gonna find out 
 In the morning about you 
 And him all up in my place 
 Is it a problem 
 And if its really one ima solve it 
 Don't know how you handle 
 Other dudes but I'm not them 
 Girl you runnin' around got them thinkin' 
 That I can't handle my thang 
 Ooh are you crazy 
 Did you really think you could play me 
 I'm about to show up on your door step 
 And you better answer 
 So when I knock knock you 
 Better be by yourself 
 She know ain't been gettin' her on the phone 
 And I know she been gettin' it somethins wrong 
 Could it be 
 That she's with the other dude from her past 
 I know damn well that she ain't 
 See her laughin' with her girlfriends 
 Lookin' at the number talkin' 'bout it's him again 
 I know she soulda called me 
 Pretty soon I'm gonna find out 
 In the morning about you and him all up in my place 
 You can't run ('cause them boys are gunna find you girl) 
 You can't hide ('cause you know I'm right behind you girl) 
 If you tell him the truth 
 Then why you actin' like you scared over there 
 You can't run ('cause them boys are gunna find you girl) 
 You can't hide ('cause you know I'm right behind you girl) 
 If what you say is true 
 Then why you keep comin' back 
 Baby, baby yeah yeah yeah 
 She know ain't been gettin' her on the phone 
 And I know she been gettin' it somethins wrong 
 Could it be 
 That she's with the other dude from her past 
 I know damn well that she ain't 
 See her laughin' with her girlfriends 
 Lookin' at the number talkin' 'bout it's him again 
 I know she soulda called me 
 Pretty soon I'm gonna find out 
 In the morning about you 
 And him all up in my place
