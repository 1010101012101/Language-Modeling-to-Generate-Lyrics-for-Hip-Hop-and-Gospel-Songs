I'm starin' at the clock 
 It's a quarter to three 
 I'm tossin in my bed 
 'Cause I jus can't sleep 
 'Cause you're not here with me 
 I'm reachin' out for you 
 I wish I could talk to you 
 Tryna figure out what's goin' on with me 
 I'm use to havin' all the answers for everything 
 Oh girl 
 I think she is the one 
 Where is that comin' from? 
 Feels so crazy 
 Baby you simply amaze me 
 So much more than lately 
 I owe it all to you (owe it all to you) 
 All those games we 
 Use to play now 
 Seem so lame to me 
 What I'm comin' down with 
 Feels new to me 
 All I know is that you are the cure 
 'Cause I been diagnosed with love 
 Does anybody know the answer to this question 
 'Cause I'm confused now 
 I'm opened for suggestions 
 My heart is talkin' loud (so loud) 
 What is this about (about) 
 I'm really changin now, oh 
 Cleared all the numbers out my phone 
 Done left that whole life alone 
 Those are two of the symptoms I see 
 And I believe 
 Oh girl, I am sure 
 That you are my miracle 
 Feels so crazy 
 Baby you simply amaze me 
 So much more than lately 
 I owe it all to you (owe it all to you) 
 All those games we 
 Use to play now 
 Seem so lame to me 
 What I'm comin' down with 
 Feels new to me 
 All I know is that you are the cure 
 'Cause I been diagnosed with love
