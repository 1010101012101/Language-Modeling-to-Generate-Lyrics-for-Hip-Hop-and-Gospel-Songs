If I asked to kiss ya 
 Would you say yes or turn and walk away, oh baby 
 See I must admit girl 
 Cause all the crazy things that go through my head 
 Whoa Oh oh No 
 It seemed just like the perfect move at the time 
 For me to make you mine 
 (Girl you sexy from head to toe) 
 You said you think we should wait a while 
 And it might be hard but 
 But I won't complain 
 You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me 
 Oh yeah 
 We can travel to space 
 As long as I got you right here next to me 
 I'm straight 
 Whoa, girl I'll wait 
 Oh, for you, yes I will 
 Oh, I said I'll wait for you 
 I just wanna love ya 
 Lord knows that I can't wait for the day 
 Na, Nah 
 I said I must admit girl 
 Baby, I swear I'll do whatever it takes 
 (To keep you here with me) 
 It seemed just like the perfect move at the time 
 For me to make you mine 
 (Girl you sexy from head to toe) 
 You said you think we should wait a while 
 Girl it might be hard but 
 But I won't complain 
 You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me 
 Oh yeah 
 We can travel to space 
 As long as I got you right here next to me 
 I'm straight 
 Whoa, girl I'll wait 
 Oh, for you, yes I will 
 Oh, I said I'll wait for you 
 It's been awhile and we both know that I've been patient girl 
 Cause you ain't been trying to give it up, no 
 But I won't complain 
 You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me 
 Oh yeah 
 We can travel this place 
 As long as I got you right here next to me 
 I'm straight 
 Whoa, girl I'll wait 
 Oh, for you, yes I will 
 Oh, I said I'll wait for you
