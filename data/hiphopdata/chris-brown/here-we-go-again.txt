Scattered thoughts, scattered brains 
 What you know about it baby 
 What you know about it baby 
 Scattered thoughts, scattered brains 
 What you know about it baby 
 What you know about it baby 
 I been running round in circles and I keep coming back to no one to find 
 And I been dealing with these women, so confused on these feelings 
 So I leave them behind 
 I been tryna find different, but really what's the difference 
 When they seem to hold out 
 Then she end up in my bed 
 Something that I said, and she thought she was mine 
 Are you still down baby 
 Are you still down baby 
 Are you really bout that life 
 Are you really bout that life 
 Are you still down baby 
 Are you still down baby 
 Is you down for the ride 
 Is you down for the ride 
 Here we go again 
 Here we go again 
 Why can't you let it go 
 'Cause I don't wanna fight 
 I don't wanna fight 
 Here we go again 
 Here we go again 
 Ooh, who could love you better 
 Ooh, I can love you better 
 I been tryna do better 
 But all of my habits got me changing my mind 
 Changing my mind 
 When they don't wanna love you 
 Next day I'm feeling off feels like I'm loving you blind 
 Loving you blind 
 I wish my heart could be stable 
 But it's up in my naval 
 Guess I'm just not ready 
 Just not ready, for you 
 Are you still down baby 
 Are you still down baby 
 Are you really bout that life 
 Are you really bout that life 
 Are you still down baby 
 Are you still down baby 
 Is you down for the ride 
 Is you down for the ride 
 Here we go again 
 Here we go again 
 Why can't you let it go 
 'Cause I don't wanna fight 
 I don't wanna fight 
 Here we go again 
 Here we go again 
 Ooh, who could love you better 
 Ooh, I can love you better 
 Won't lie baby 
 I won't lie baby 
 I said I won't lie baby 
 Who could love you better? 
 Won't lie baby 
 I won't lie baby 
 I said I won't lie baby 
 Who could love you better? 
 Let the gun go baby 
 The gun go baby 
 Just let the gun go baby 
 Gun go baby 
 The gun go baby 
 Just let the gun go baby 
 Don't do it girl 
 Here we go again 
 Here we go again 
 Why can't you let it go 
 'Cause I don't wanna fight 
 I don't wanna fight 
 Here we go again 
 Here we go again 
 Ooh, who could love you better 
 Ooh, I can love you better
