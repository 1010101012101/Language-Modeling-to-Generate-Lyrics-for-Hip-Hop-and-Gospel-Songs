(Chris Brown) 
 I go by the name of Yung Chris Breezy 
 Its hard to see me 'cause I'm fly as a plane 
 And my swag is in 3-D 
 I do this in my sleep 
 In other words its really easy 
 New album comin' soon 
 And I'm callin it graffiti 
 They yellin' calm down Chris 
 Please take it easy 
 I am takin' it easy 
 But they do not believe me 
 Is it 'cause I'm getting this cash money 
 Like weezy? 
 Ridin' in my lambo, 
 Listenin to jeezy? 
 I gotta Spanish chica 
 All she wanna do is please me 
 So shawty got a face 
 Right above where my knees be 
 Super freaky, and I call her flavor of love 
 'Cause she's willin' to do anything 
 Just to be on the TV 
 Hot as ever and there's something 
 Y'all should know 
 Told ya that I wasn't playin' 
 So in I go! 
 Have you ever seen me and rock cities 
 Live show? 
 All I gotta say is P. T. F. A. O. 
 But enough about them 
 Now its back, to me! 
 I'm on my grind everyday 
 'Cause I gots, to be 
 I'm on another level 
 Homie and its sad, to see 
 That I'm killin' it and I ain't 
 Even a rapper B! 
 VA where it all goes down 
 The home of Cliffs, Missy, Trey Songz and you're boy 
 Chris Brown 
 I gotta represent, homie for my home town 
 If you ain't informed 
 Nigga now you know now 
 While I'm at it, 
 Let me wave a Virgin Islands Flag, 
 'Cause if I don't Rock Cities gon get mad 
 I'm so fly that, 
 Even when I'm not on an airplane 
 Homie I be still getting jet lag 
 That's just a little verse man 
 I was just having fun. 
 But I brought my homies 
 All the way from the virgin islands 
 (Rock City) 
 Fresh off the leash 
 Fresh off the streets 
 Same timin so I guess you can say 
 I'm fresh off the beach 
 If there's 5 best rappers 
 Homie lets all compete 
 And if you ain't spittin' crack 
 Step the hell off the beat 
 Whatevers you're favorite song 
 Most likely we wrote it 
 If you hate me 
 You love me too 
 And you even know it 
 My brother in the back 
 Yellin' please don't do it! (don't do it!) 
 Chris Brown killed it 
 So I'm about to blow it 
 I'm a serial killer 
 Micro phone gorilla 
 2010 thriller can't nobody do it iller 
 I got a new name 
 That you can call me 
 Instead of dope y'all just refer to me 
 As mr. one hell of a nigga 
 Who you know do it bigger? 
 Than me and Chris Brizzle? 
 The flow so cold 
 Like the mic is a Popsicle 
 When I'm done you gon have to 
 Put the mic in the hospital 
 And I ain't even killed it, 
 Ok maybe a little 
 Hold on hold on! 
 I'm buggin, 
 VA up! 
 Car Keys 
 House Keys 
 Apartment keys 
 We a long mother F*** way from broke! 
 I put that on my sons 
 Got my homie Chris Breezy! 
 And before I leave you know watsup 
 Ptfao! 
 Rock City 
 I just like to talk **** 
 Don't stop the beat 
 We toldem! 
 In my best Khaled impression, 
 We the BEST!
