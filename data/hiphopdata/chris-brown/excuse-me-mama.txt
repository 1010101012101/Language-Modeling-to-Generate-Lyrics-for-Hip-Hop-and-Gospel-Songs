I was at the mall on some back to school 
 Tryna cop me a couple pairs shoes 
 And then I looked to my left 
 And I lost my breath 'cause this girl was so fresh 
 Really wasn't tryna intrude 
 But she looked like the type I was into 
 And I wanted to holla she was with her mama 
 Felt like a catch 22 
 I shoulda step to her, 
 Without any disrespect to her 
 And I thought she would like 
 If I kept it polite 
 So I stepped and this is what I said 
 Excuse me mama (hey) 
 Your daughters fine (your daughter's fine) 
 And If I could id like a moment of her time (a moment of her time) 
 While I was shoppin', I saw her walking by 
 So can I get her number and ill give her mine? 
 Wishin I could catch her by herself 
 Waitin till she wasn't with nobody else 
 But every time I saw her 
 I would try to call her, 
 But she was busy checkin' for the sales 
 Part of me was like just let it go 
 The other part of me was like let her know, 
 But I will never get this chance 
 My life again I gotta man up and tell her so 
 I shoulda step to her, 
 And I thought she would like 
 If I kept it polite 
 So I stepped and this is what I said 
 Excuse me mama (hey) 
 Your daughters fine (so fine, so fine) 
 And If I could I would like a moment of her time 
 While I was shopping I saw her walking by 
 So can I get her number and ill give her mine? 
 (Breakdown) 
 Baby don't you know that u 
 Got me all up in the wrong store 
 Now the malls bout to close 
 Crazy, but I followed you 
 'Cause I just couldn't take it no more 
 No disrespect to your mama but I need that 
 Number baby yeah... 
 Excuse me mama (hey) 
 Your daughters fine 
 And If I could id like a moment of her time 
 While I was shopping I saw her walking by 
 So can I get her number and ill give her mine? 
 Woh ohohohoh
