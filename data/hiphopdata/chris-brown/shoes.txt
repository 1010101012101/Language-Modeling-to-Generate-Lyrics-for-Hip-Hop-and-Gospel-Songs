I gotta problem, I got the answer now 
 No more singin' chicks I'm messin with a dancer now 
 She got a stripper pole, know how to break it down 
 She went from nothing to something, she tryna make it now 
 She's original I boosted up her style 
 She's got a downtown bitch just to make me smile 
 We was finna go but she naked now, and she did it in front of an audience 
 Shawty got ass 
 Skinny lil waste, I ain't stupid can't let it go to waste 
 Man dam she got swag 
 Temperatures heat, picture perfect every scene 
 Any camera FLASH 
 Go and try to get her, but when you do she says that I'm with her 
 They got the last, I'm chasin with the mask 
 Tell me whos meaner when I switch 'em like sneakers 
 And you know I never never wear the same pair twice 
 I gotta keep 'em laced cause my tongue game nice 
 I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal 
 Can't take nothing from me 'cause I live that life (x2) 
 I can't get rid of her, can't understand it now 
 I got the fresh girl nigga you got the hand me down 
 You got the sloppy seconds, already dug it out 
 I did my dougie, sat down and let her work it out 
 She got them cakes out, I call her betty crocker 
 Mr. Flinstone I can make your bed rock 
 When I was tryna go, she got naked now 
 Shawty took it off in a dolorian 
 And you know I never never wear the same pair twice 
 I gotta keep 'em laced cause my tongue game nice 
 I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal 
 Can't take nothing from me 'cause I live that life (x2) 
 'Cause I treat 'em like shoes 
 DarkmanWhether Jordan 13s or Jordan D-wades 
 With every new pair my old pair feel played 
 New Carmello's, new Chris Paul's 
 Little do they know I love all y'all 
 I treat 'em like pros, high top or lows 
 Space Jam, Buggs bunny, Jordan retros 
 She bring it back, Barkley's all black 
 Or the red, white and gray Air Macs 
 I like that, a closet full of sneakers 
 Just like my black book full of freakers 
 Lotta dark men, L.A deep 
 Only wear nike or the timbaland shoes 
 Bridge I treat 'em like shoes, yeah that's what I do 
 Man a nanny boo boo, I'm shittin on you 
 I treat 'em all like shoes, some rough and some smooth (just like shoes) 
 More than ones that I use, she gotta a dunk alieou 
 Nikes like new, treat 'em all like shoes (treat 'em all like shoes)
