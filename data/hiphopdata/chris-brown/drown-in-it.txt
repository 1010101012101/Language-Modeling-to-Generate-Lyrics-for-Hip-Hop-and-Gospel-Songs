It don't get no better 
 My tongue writing you letters 
 Feeling you get wetter 
 We'll be making love until the morning after 
 And I can feel your tide slowly rising 
 As I'm sipping from your water fountain 
 We gon' flood the bed, take it to the ground 
 While I'm in your ocean baby, hold my head down 
 Down, down 
 I wanna drown in it, drown in it 
 Drown in it, drown in it 
 I wanna drown in it, drown in it 
 Drown in it, drown in it 
 I will never come up, oh 
 High heels and your red lips 
 It's farenheit in here 
 And I can see a million ways 
 For me to surfboard between your waist 
 We be going up down, all around 
 Drip drop, don't stop 
 No umbrella, playing in your rain 
 Splashing in your deep end 
 Hydrate me, oh baby 
 Come sit that right on my face 
 I wanna drown in it, drown in it 
 Drown in it, drown in it 
 I wanna drown in it, drown in it 
 Drown in it, drown in it 
 I will never come up, oh 
 Baby, baby, baby 
 Baby, baby, baby 
 Take me under babe 
 No, props compares to what it's worth 
 Your pool is like heaven on Earth 
 You screaming while I'm touching your spot 
 Oh girl, I got your water so hot 
 And I wanna drown in it 
 I wanna drown in it, babe 
 I wanna drown in it, baby 
 All you gotta do is - 
 Keep filling me up with your juices 
 Keep it right there baby, don't lose it 
 I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Yeah, baby) 
 Drown in it, drown in it (Girl, just take me under) 
 I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Under your waters, girl) 
 Drown in it, drown in it (Swim in your deep, babe) 
 I wanna drown in it, drown in it (All up in your creek, baby) 
 Drown in it, drown in it 
 And I'm not coming up 
 I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Gonna stay right there, baby) 
 Drown in it, drown in it (Gonna live in there, baby) 
 I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Right there under your water baby) 
 Drown in it, drown in it (Just like a male mermaid, babe) 
 I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Baby, baby, baby, baby) 
 Drown in it, drown in it (Baby, baby, baby, baby) 
 I will never come up, oh
