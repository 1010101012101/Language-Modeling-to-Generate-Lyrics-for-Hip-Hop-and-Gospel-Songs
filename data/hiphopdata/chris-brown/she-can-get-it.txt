Down, get it down! 
 Down, get it down! 
 Down, get it down! 
 Down, get it down! 
 More money, more riches, 
 More freaky, model misses 
 6 4 booty, make it hit switches, 
 Shawty sitting on 40 inches. 
 I like her, she like me, 
 I wanna love her, she wanna love me! 
 That happening is unlikely 
 I got a... with a ... lightspeed 
 Spinning like a tornado, 
 Then I eat it up like it's gourmet food 
 Then I beat it up like boom, boom, boom, 
 Then I get girls like zoom 
 Climb on top of me, underneath the sheets, 
 'Cause I'm about to take you down, 
 And change your last name to mrs. brown. 
 She know she could get it, get it, 
 She know she could get it, get it, 
 She know she could get it, get it, 
 So I'mma give it to her with the ghetto kamasutra 
 I'm gonna give it to her, 
 She gonna take it, 
 But when she do it to you 
 She'll be faking. 
 She's a five star chick on my a list, 
 I've have her body bent over like the matrix. 
 I ain't mad at you, do your thing, girl! 
 But you never had a r&b singer 
 I promise you will never go back, 
 So let me hit it out the park 
 We go VA, LA, new york, atlanta, 
 Houston, Chi Town, rollin' on the tour bus, 
 I've seen a lot of ladies but I'm feelin' you, 
 I've gotta let you know 
 Shawty you can get it! 
 She know she could get it, get it, 
 She know she could get it, get it, 
 She know she could get it, get it, 
 So I'mma give it to her with the ghetto kamasutra
