I'm writing this letter 
 You better read it, cause in this letter 
 Ill make you see that ain't no one better... 
 For you than me... no... 
 I'm singing this song 
 Hope your listening would I do wrong 
 There's somehing missing why can't you settle 
 Can't let things be... 
 I'm trying not understand 
 You always answer you ain't ready 
 But we've been talkin', lay it on steady 
 I wanna know if and when your ready 
 If I'm gone be your man 
 'Cause I ain't gotta follow the waiting 
 But I ain't trynna wait in vein 
 Would you want me 2 be your man 
 Just call me and say yes (10x) 
 Look in the mirror 
 You didn't know that I stay up all night thinking about you girl I'm getting ready thinking bout what I'm ganna do when you become my girl & I become your man for the sweat and steady dreaming 
 I'm trying not understand 
 You always answer you ain't ready 
 But we've been talkin', lay it on steady 
 I wanna know if and when your ready 
 If I'm gone be your man 
 'Cause I ain't gotta follow the waiting 
 But I ain't trynna wait in vein 
 Would you want me 2 be your man 
 Just call me and say yes (10x)
