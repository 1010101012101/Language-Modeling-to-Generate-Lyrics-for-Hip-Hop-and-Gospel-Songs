Your world 
 I wanna live in it 
 Your world 
 I wanna live in it 
 Your world 
 I wanna live in it 
 Your world 
 Your world 
 (I been) 
 Chilling on the beach 
 Down in Mexico 
 Staring at the lights up in Tokyo 
 Dancing in Spain as the rain falls down 
 (I been) 
 In New York City 
 Where they never sleep 
 First class flights on the way to Greece 
 I been everywhere 
 And back around 
 See I been to London 
 And I been through France 
 And all that means nothin' 
 If you don't give me a chance 
 'Cause it's your world 
 Yeah it your world 
 That I've never been 
 Until you let me in 
 Cause in my world 
 Yeah in my world 
 I can never win 
 Until you let me into your world 
 I can't stop thinking 'bout you every night 
 Picturing your body laying next to mine 
 What's it gonna take for you to open up 
 'Cause I wanna know everything about your world 
 I wanna be there when you need me girl 
 I wanna be more than a fool in love 
 See I been to London 
 And I been through France 
 And all that means nothin' 
 If you don't give me a chance 
 'Cause it's your world 
 Yeah it your world 
 That I've never been 
 Until you let me in 
 Cause in my world 
 Yeah in my world 
 I can never win 
 Until you let me into your world 
 Baby let me dive into your ocean 
 Let ee wish on your shooting star 
 We gotta put this thing in motion 
 Bring our two worlds to the same heart 
 Your world 
 I wanna live in it 
 Your world 
 I wanna live in it 
 Your world 
 I wanna live in it 
 Your world 
 Come on girl 
 'Cause it's your world 
 Yeah it your world 
 That I've never been 
 Until you let me in 
 Cause in my world 
 Yeah in my world 
 I can never win 
 Until you let me into your world 
 'Cause it's your world 
 Yeah it your world 
 That I've never been 
 Until you let me in 
 Cause in my world 
 Yeah in my world 
 I can never win 
 Until you let me into your world
