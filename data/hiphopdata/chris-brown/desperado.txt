Shit is kind of crazy 
 How you work me lately 
 Thought I wouldn't notice 
 I can see you changin' 
 When did all this happen? 
 All this extra foreplay 
 How you gon try to play me? 
 Then go and try to kiss my face 
 I want you to know that it's over 
 Get your shit right now 
 I guess the good guy's always play the fool 
 I want you to that I'll be fine if you're not my girl 
 Don't need you anymore 
 Don't love you anymore 
 'Cause you're a cold desperado 
 No more lies 
 And me feeling like something's wrong 
 You got me 
 Good one, baby 
 Why'd you break my heart? 
 Never thought you were this way before 
 But now I know 
 But I ain't gonna run away 
 Little mama 
 You won't put me out 
 'Cause I bought this house, so leave 
 If you so fly, be gone 
 If you the shit, here's some toilet paper 
 You did me a favor 
 I want you to know that it's over 
 Get your shit right now 
 I guess the good guy's always play the fool 
 I want you to that I'll be fine if you're not my girl 
 Don't need you anymore 
 Don't love you anymore 
 'Cause you're a cold desperado
