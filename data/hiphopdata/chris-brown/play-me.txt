Girl I been waiting up all night 
 Sippin' tryna get rid of this pain 
 Henny in my cup all night 
 And it don't even matter if I take that 
 It can never take your mistakes back 
 Even if I take every sip of this bottle 
 Ain't a damn thing can erase that 
 The shit you did way too hard to swallow 
 I bet I take one to the head now 
 Before the get back 
 Imma take two to my bed now 
 But you a memory 
 Best believe Imma lay it down 
 From all the bullshit that be goin' through my head now 
 It's fucked up how you play me 
 It's fucked up how you play me 
 It's fucked up how you play me 
 So you might as well just erase me 
 Go and erase me 
 She on but a nigga just can't keep on 
 Go and erase me 
 She on but a nigga just can't keep on 
 Go and erase me 
 Valet finna pull up 
 This girl couldn't be fuller 
 Now you up in that place 
 And the Dj ain't the only one about to pull up 
 I need you to know this ain't all about you 
 This ain't all about you now 
 When I do my thing 
 Women in my range, I'mma need me about two now 
 One to the head now 
 Before the get back 
 Imma take two to my bed now 
 But you a memory 
 Best believe Imma lay it down 
 Imma lay it down, Imma lay it down 
 For all the shit goin' through my head now 
 For all the shit goin' through my head now 
 It's fucked up how you play me 
 It's fucked up how you play me 
 It's fucked up how you play me 
 So you might as well just erase me 
 It's fucked up how you play me 
 It's fucked up how you play me 
 It's fucked up how you play me 
 So you might as well just erase me 
 Go and erase me 
 She on but a nigga just can't keep on so 
 Go and erase me 
 She on but a nigga just can't keep on 
 Go and erase me
