 Swim in the Mike Phelps 
 Under my gucci belt

 Not unstrap my gucci belt 
 More shoppers than johnny depp in that mosso 
 So many game impasso 
 Riding ram in the boxsters

 Sippin on bell with damn vodka 
 So many tricks 
 Hit 'em in a little bit can't grab banana split 
 I ain't no chicken 
 Never been no chicken ish

 If I'm going down I'm eating it like? 
 Knocking on my dressing room 
 Just to get freaking chris

 Freakin on my fresh fit 
 Curve
