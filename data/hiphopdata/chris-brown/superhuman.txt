Weak 
 I have been crying and crying for weeks 
 How'd I survive when I can barely speak 
 Barely eat 
 On my knees 
 But that's the moment you came to me 
 I don't know what your love has done to me 
 Think I'm invincible 
 I see through the me 
 I used to be 
 You changed my whole life 
 Don't know what you're doing 
 To me with your love 
 I'm feeling all superhuman you did this to me 
 Superhuman heart beats in me 
 Nothing can stop me here with you 
 Superhuman 
 (I feel so superhuman) Superhuman 
 (I feel so superhuman) 
 Superhuman 
 Strong since I've been flying and riding the wrongs 
 Feels almost like had it all along I can see tomorrow 
 But every problem is gone because 
 I've flown everywhere with love inside of me 
 It's unbelievable to see 
 How love can set me free 
 You changed my whole life 
 Don't know what you're doing 
 To me with your love 
 I'm feeling all superhuman you did this to me 
 Superhuman heart beats in me 
 Nothing can stop me here with you 
 Superhuman 
 (I feel so superhuman) Superhuman 
 (I feel so superhuman) 
 It's not a bird, not a plane. 
 It's my heart and it's going gone away 
 My only weakness is you 
 Only reason is you 
 Every minute with you 
 I feel like I can do anything 
 Going going I'm gone away in love 
 You changed my whole life 
 Don't know what you're doing 
 To me with your love 
 I'm feeling all superhuman you did this to me 
 Superhuman heart beats in me 
 Nothing can stop here with you 
 Superhuman
