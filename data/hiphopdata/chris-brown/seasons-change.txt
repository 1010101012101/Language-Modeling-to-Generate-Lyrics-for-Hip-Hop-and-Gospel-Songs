Been a month or two kethina 
 Eight weeks for me exactly 
 Since we sat and talked for hours 
 Girl it just ain't right 
 When you give me the run around 
 I can't even give you flowers 
 It's all in your head when your friends talk about me 
 You run away from the truth and accept the lies 
 You doubt me 
 I'm like a fool contemplating 
 I'm just waiting on your call 
 We couldn't last through the winter 
 And now it's fall 
 We fell off, I'm still falling 
 Sometimes I let my thoughts run away from me 
 Don't know how many days in a year 
 Running round, running round till I catch up 
 Now why the hell I let you get away from me 
 Never thought that I would say goodbye to my girl 
 Girl you change like the seasons 
 Girl I've given my time and all my love 
 Not to mention I didn't cheat 
 But you didn't even trust me 
 Even when you had late night messages on your phone baby 
 I never said a word 
 I just left it alone 
 It's all in your head when your friends talk about me 
 You run away from the truth and accept the lies 
 You doubt me 
 I'm like a fool contemplating 
 I'm just waiting on your call 
 We couldn't last through the winter 
 And now it's fall 
 We fell off, I'm still falling 
 Sometimes I let my thoughts run away from me 
 Don't know how many days in a year 
 Running round, running round till I catch up 
 Now why the hell I let you get away from me 
 Never thought that I would say goodbye to my girl 
 Girl you change like the seasons 
 No, I'll never see the brighter side 
 'Cause you're everything that I wanted 
 And I don't wanna see you go 
 I don't wanna spend the rest of my life 
 Without you here with me 
 I'll never let go 
 I need you 
 Sometimes I let my thoughts run away from me 
 Don't know how many days in a year 
 Running round, running round till I catch up 
 Now why the hell I let you get away from me 
 Never thought that I would say goodbye to my girl 
 Girl you change like the seasons
