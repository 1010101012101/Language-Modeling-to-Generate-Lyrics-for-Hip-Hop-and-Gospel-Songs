Who is it on my radio 
 Bustin' splits on the dance floor 
 Snaggin awards and keep dough 
 Havin' the girls like oh 
 Who is it blazin' the track 
 Yungin 
 The smoothest cat 
 Cool like that 
 Got all the haters 
 Sayin' I smell a rat 
 All the people 
 Treated me mean 
 All in my face 
 Once I hit the scene 
 Hittin me up asking fo dat green 
 I'm like nigga please 
 From the CD to ma show 
 I ain't stole 
 No gimmicks 
 Just a pro 
 That's original 
 Reppin dat young 
 From the brain to toe 
 No gimmicks 
 Just a pro 
 I'm original 
 (Hey Usher) 
 Naw I'm Chris Brown 
 (MJ) 
 Haters sit down 
 (That seems familiar) 
 Naw 'cause I'm new in town 
 Seem like they only 
 Wanna see me frown 
 Buying my album 
 Tryna see who I copped 
 To the haters who bought it thanks a lot 
 Remember sayin' I'm a 
 One hit wonder 
 That's gonna flop 
 Five singles later and I'm still on top 
 Going platinum 
 The first week it dropped 
 I might pause but I'll never stop 
 No 
 Prince of RnB and hip hop 
 I'm hot like fire 
 But never a liar 
 Hot like hell 
 My albums can only sell 
 Stoppin' hearts 
 Since I started been 
 #1 on 106 and park 
 Spreading that new slang 
 17 and doin' ma thang 
 Write my own songs 
 Create my dance 
 Do my own harmony 
 Doin' just fine without a mami 
 Get and opportunity got the 
 Talent to sing and go 
 If that's phony I don't wanna 
 Be original
