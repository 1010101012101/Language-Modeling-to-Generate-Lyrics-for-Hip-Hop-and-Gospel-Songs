Chris Brown: 
 Uh, Boom, Boom 
 We ballin' in the room 
 Sweepin' up my competition call me Mr. broom 
 Knockin' niqqaz over, call me bulldozer, 
 One more drink for these *** and it's over, 
 'Cause I'm a strike that something like a cobra, 
 I know she want my venom, but I ain't gon' leave it in her, 
 And right after I get her, she know she with a winner, 
 And we straight to the crib, I ain't takin' her to dinner, 
 (Chris brown laughs) 
 Nigga look at my jewels, 
 Aviator shades I ain't lookin' at you, 
 Ah chu, bless me twice, 
 Be a rich nigga I be shitin' on your life, 
 Magazine covers, magnem rubbers, 
 I mean magnum, I don't fuck with stragglers, 
 Niggaz want drama, Gangsta Grillz bastards 
 Did you check the caption ? lights camera, action 
 Holla at Me Boo, Holla at Me Baby, (x3) 
 I'm Turnt Up, I'm Super Turnt Up (x2) 
 A nigga beat, beat 
 And shawty toot, toot, 
 Blowin' out there brains, car need a new roof, 
 Lookin' like a superstar, when I roll through 
 And shawty I'm the truth, so mama what it do? 
 Now let's ride out, ain't no trippin' 
 When we dippin' to my hide-out, 
 Big dipper cause you sippin' on my bottle 
 Only fuckin' with them A-listin' models, 
 Now let's get it like ... 
 (?) Did it, if you done it, 
 Then I did it 
 If you kick it, 
 Then I'm with it 
 We can do this shit all-night 
 Your minute don't compare to my limit 
 When I'm in it 
 And I get it I'm a give it to you all night, 
 I'm the shit yeah I go hard, 
 Don't stand in lines nigga I bogart 
 Fat boy celebrity 'cause I'm so large 
 And don't need no battery 'cause I'm in charge 
 Holla at Me Boo, Holla at Me Baby, (x3) 
 I'm Turnt Up, I'm Super Turnt Up (x2)

 Snap back them ain't even rare, where the tag at ?, 
 Wack-ass all up in my ear bitch bag back,

 Yellow nigga, no cabs 
 Got the phantom out, no mats, 
 Get your camera out uh, one flash, 
 Hot beams steady shot clap your ass,

 Patron top wash straight from the liquor store,
