Chris Brown: 
 Elmo come take a walk with me 
 It's a beautiful day and I think we should go out into the neighborhood and see what we can see 
 Look this sign says welcome here and bakery here and thank you there 
 Will you help me on my way and come along with me and 
 See the signs there everywhere 
 That's enter here and exit there 
 (Chris and Elmo) 
 Let's take it easy as we go Elmo these are the signs that we all know 
 Stop right there 
 Dance with me 
 Closed... Open 
 Wet paint school 
 Tell me what signs you see
