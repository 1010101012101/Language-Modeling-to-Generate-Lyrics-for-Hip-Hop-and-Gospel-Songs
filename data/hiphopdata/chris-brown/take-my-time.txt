I just wanna take my time 
 Cause stingy as you are I think you're ready 
 Girl I wanna do you right 
 I just wanna give you what you need, baby girl 
 Take my time 
 Ooh just do me 
 Do you right 
 (Verse 1: Chris Brown) 
 Girl when you step all wet from out the shower baby 
 I want you to lay down just stay naked 
 Now I'm staring for an hour babe ooh 
 I got your back up against the wall 
 I got strength won't let you fall 
 When I make you bloom like a flower babe, babe 
 (Verse 2: Tank) 
 It ain't your fault you ran out of power babe 
 'Cause I've been kissing and licking on you every way 
 I wanna hear you scream my name 
 And girl you know the way 
 Baby it's cool I'll wait for you baby 
 Ooh 
 I just wanna take my time 
 Cause stingy as you are I think you're ready 
 Girl I wanna do you right 
 I just wanna give you what you need, baby girl 
 Take my time 
 Ooh just do me 
 Do you right 
 (Break: Girl Moaning) 
 I just wanna take my time 
 Cause stingy as you are I think you're ready 
 Girl I wanna do you right 
 I just wanna give you what you need baby girl 
 Take my time 
 Ooh just do me 
 Do you right
