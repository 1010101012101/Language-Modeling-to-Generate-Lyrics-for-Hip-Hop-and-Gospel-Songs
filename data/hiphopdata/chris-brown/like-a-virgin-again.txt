(Chris Brown) 
 Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain 
 'Cause it's getting hot girl, 
 Give me all you got girl 
 Don't have to rush, ain't going nowhere 
 I'll take off your thong, put your legs in the air 
 Girl I'm gonna pick you up, pick you up 
 Rock you like a baby 
 Loving you so crazy 
 I'm gone make you have a flash back 
 To your first time 
 But this time you know just what you like so... 
 Don't be acting shy up in this room 
 Like I make you nervous (oh) 
 Ima take my time and do your body right 
 If you let me (uh huh) I promise 
 Ima make you feel like a virgin again, again 
 Ima make you feel like a virgin again, again 
 Ima make you feel like a virgin again, again 
 Ima make you feel like a virgin, 
 Promise ima make it all worth it 
 Ima make you feel like a virgin again 
 This is for my grown 
 This is for my grown ass, sexy ass (women) 
 This is for my grown 
 This is for my grown ass, sexy ass (women) 
 (Tyga) 
 Let me kiss you to start it off 
 Damn your lips so soft 
 Make a nigga wanna bite them off 
 Ima be your porn star 
 Baby take your clothes off 
 Let me taste between your legs, 
 Damn, you got me so hard 
 If I get it ima hit it right (right) 
 I know you tired, it's the middle of the night 
 Wanna give you that good love 
 Fall in love with me shawty you just might 
 (Ass up) 
 Legs up to the sky 
 I know this ain't your first time 
 So baby don't be... 
 Don't be acting shy up in this room 
 Like I make you nervous (oh)
