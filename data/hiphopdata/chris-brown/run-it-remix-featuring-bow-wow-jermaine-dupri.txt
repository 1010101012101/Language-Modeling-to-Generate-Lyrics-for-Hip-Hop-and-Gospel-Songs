 For the boy, Bow Wow and that boy Chris Brown 
 All I wanna do is see you take it to the ground, bring it up slow 
 Twurk that thang like them girls in the videos 
 And I'm leavin' here with somethin'

 So scream at it nigga when you're ready to ride 
 Come on

 So baby, won't you rock me 
 Now if ya man ain't on the flo then I'ma step in 
 Replace him, tell yo friends after party at my spot 
 Shawty gotta come back 'cause she so hot 
 Now we lookin' for them grown girls 
 That ain't scared to get to it 
 Know what to do when we drop that music 
 Lil mini skirts 'cause she lookin' good 
 Got different color weaves mayne she so hood 
 I like 'em thick in the waist, ten in the face 
 The girls come to us so we don't chase 
 She move her booty like a low rider up, down 
 Man, she likes the way that I puts it down 
 And ain't nothin' to a G, I do this on the daily 
 You don't believe me you can ask JD 
 And it ain't no second guessin' 
 Matter fact, baby girl, I got one question now 
 Is ya man on the flo? 
 If he ain't let me know 
 Let me see If you can run it, run it 
 Girl, indeed I can run it, run it 
 Is ya man on the flo?

 Girl, indeed I can run it, run it 
 Right about now
