(Feat. Paul Cain, Joe Budden) 
 Uh, I'm a motherfuckin' ghetto superstar nigga 
 Uh, you ain't know? 
 Look at me you see me 
 Street Family 
 Fabolous: 
 Right you can lie and gossip to 
 And later on be the guy who the mobsters do 
 And right now you can try and prosecute 
 But later on you 'gon die in the hospital 
 (Verse 1: Fabolous) 
 I'm the guy that's responsible 
 Denyin' is impossible 
 You ever have a nigga that's tryin' to sponsor you? 
 You can die like them mobsters do 
 Actin' like gangstas, like Denzel you guys should get Oscars to 
 Call them guys in ya hostle crew 
 Before they get holes in they face the size of they nostrils to 
 Street Family abide by the mobster rules 
 Visors and Oscar shoes 
 Not on the Coster suits 
 You can tell I'm fly by my posture boo 
 Get in to the thighs of a prostitute 
 And buy her a popsicle 
 That's why you hear lots of oooohs 
 They ain't ever seen a ghetto superstar like me 
 I'll show you how to do this young'n 
 I ain't frontin' these Jordans ain't comin' 
 I'm in the island of Saint something 
 Keep the complaints comin' nigga 
 (Verse 2: Paul Cain) 
 Yo a hustles a hustle from ghetto to ghetto 
 In a 4.6 Range Rov Canarie Yellow and metal 
 Muzzle to muzzle for hit movement 
 I'm a stop ya blood flow if ya try to stop my chip movement 
 I be on strips doin' 
 My grind thing brick movin' 
 Flood the cross for the thick cuban 
 In a town in the South 
 In the spot 4 pound in the couch 
 Came back, four thou off a ounce 
 Alls it takes is a quarter of brick 
 And a half a pound of dro get ya grind game and all them pitched 
 Got the crack and the weed up 
 Flip that, pop a dice game, catch a jook and put 'em back with the re-up 
 That's grindin' 
 Fo' Fo' tucked in the lining 
 Get low when them hot ones flyin' 
 Come at me wrong you dyin' 
 No lyin' 
 (Verse 3: Joe Budden) 
 Hey dog, we not familar 
 Cross me I'm a pop and kill ya 
 Its Joe Budden, in the streets they call me Glocks For Hire 
 Before I was Jump Off I was Ox's supplier 
 Y'all passin' the Rosay for Joe 
 I'm part time Kiser Sosay's actin' coach 
 Nowadays dog, I don't hear rappers 
 Fuck bars, we could all get the fours out and play Fear Factor 
 Move the brick 
 Rug on my hip 
 But Skane keep talkin' that music shit 
 Its nothin' 
 Let the game know ya man's on the come up 
 First week soundscan I'm doin' Spider-Man numbers 
 Cars, jewels, casinos and up 
 Try and ball like Paul Pierce I'll Benzino you up 
 Man ya crews decoys 
 Desert Storm use these toys 
 Bite the bullet like Bruce Leroy 
 Get right with me 
 Newest king in the league like Mike Bibby 
 I'm a show you how to do this son 
 Don't front cause the V so fine 
 And when I'm in the strip club they don't pay Mr. Cheeks no mind 
 Had 'em gun blind 
 Cameras wan't mine 
 But they big men soft like the Dallas Frontline 
 Max Payne never seen a car like it 
 First nigga to move weight from a Palm Pilot
