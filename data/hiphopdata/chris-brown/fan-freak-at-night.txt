Don't let that pretty face fool ya 
 See that girl, she's hot like fire 
 Don't judge a book just off the cover 
 That girl right there, she'll blow your mind 
 Behind closed doors yeah 
 She's something like an animal 
 Behind closed doors yeah 
 You know that girl is a professional 
 When the lights on 
 She be acting shy 
 But in the darkness 
 She comes alive 
 She's a fan 
 But that's alright, she's a freak at night 
 But that's what I like 
 Look in her eyes 
 It's no surprise 
 She's a freak at night 
 She's a freak at night 
 She's a freak at night 
 She's such an innocent killer 
 She don't even mean no harm 
 Feels like I'm on the set of thriller 
 When the evening starts to fall 
 Behind closed doors yeah 
 She's something like an animal 
 Behind closed doors yeah 
 You know that girl is a professional so 
 When the lights on 
 She be acting shy 
 But in the darkness 
 She comes alive 
 She's a fan 
 But that's alright, she's a freak at night 
 But that's what I like 
 Look in her eyes 
 It's no surprise 
 She's a freak at night 
 She's a freak at night 
 She's a freak at night 
 Freak at night 
 That's what I like 
 Vampire to the pussy 
 Imma take a bite 
 Never dry for the dick 
 She gone take a flight 
 A trip to Parrie, overnight 
 Banging to the beat with our clothes off 
 Taking shot after shot till we doze off 
 And I smoke about a pound, that loud shit 
 And she fucking with the white, blow her nose off 
 Yeah, you a fan why not 
 Bet you never seen a cool nigga this hot 
 I spend a hundred grand, nigga look at this watch 
 And her panties on the fan 'cause I'm hitting that spot 
 Okay, when I pull up, I pull out and put it in 
 And she gone run that shit when I get it in 
 Two door, got two floors to my Benz 
 I fuck fans, I fuck fans 
 So when the lights on 
 She be acting shy 
 But in the darkness 
 She comes alive 
 She's a fan 
 But that's alright, she's a freak at night 
 But that's what I like 
 Look in her eyes 
 It's no surprise 
 She's a freak at night 
 She's a freak at night 
 She's a freak at night
