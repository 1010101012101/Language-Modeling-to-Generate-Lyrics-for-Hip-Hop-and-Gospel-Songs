Said I'm all up in my feelings 
 Doubled up on this shot 
 Got me feeling some type of way 
 Told you I hate you, I don't mean it 
 And the only thing that I got 
 Is the pain that you been feeding 
 Faded, faded, faded 
 All because of you 
 And my current situation 
 Trying not to think of you, not to break the rules 
 Why it always happens, when I get this way? 
 Just can't stop myself 
 So baby tonight 
 I'm blowing up your line 
 I got you on my mind 
 And that truth is hard to fight 
 So I'll be 
 I'll be drunk texing, drunk texting, drunk texting you 
 Drunk texting, drunk texting you 
 Yeah baby 
 I'll be drunk texing, drunk texting, drunk texting you 
 Drunk texting, drunk texting you 
 Drunk Texting you 
 Drunk Texting you 
 Drunk Texting you 
 Drunk Texting you 
 Looking at my phone thinking 
 Am I gonna hit send or not? 
 It's gonna be one of them moments when I wake up and regret it 
 If I don't get no reply 
 I don't wanna make it obvious that I'm 
 Faded, faded, faded 
 Off a drink or two 
 And you know how it goes 
 This ain't nothing new 
 Why does it always happen, when I get this way? 
 No, I just can't stop myself 
 So baby tonight 
 I'm blowing up your line 
 I got you on my mind 
 And that truth is hard to fight 
 So I'll be 
 I'll be drunk texing, drunk texting, drunk texting you 
 Drunk texting, drunk texting you 
 Yeah baby 
 I'll be drunk texing, drunk texting, drunk texting you 
 Drunk texting, drunk texting you 
 Intoxicated (intoxicated) 
 That's when I think of you the most 
 Right after the tides, anything goes 
 When I put my pride aside 
 I be doing the most, doing the most 
 I done spent 1, 2, 3 am thinking about you 
 Don't wanna be without ya 
 'Cause I'm on that liquid courage 
 I hope the shit is worth it 
 'Cause if it ain't, then it's all bad (all bad) 
 So baby tonight 
 I'm blowing up your line 
 I got you on my mind 
 And that truth is hard to fight 
 So I'll be 
 I'll be drunk texing, drunk texting, drunk texting you 
 Drunk texting, drunk texting you 
 Yeah baby 
 I'll be drunk texing, drunk texting, drunk texting you 
 Drunk texting, drunk texting you 
 If by chance you're laying next to someone else right now

 Hope it's the worst sex ever
