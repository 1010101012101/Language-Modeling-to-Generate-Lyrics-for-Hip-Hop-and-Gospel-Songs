 Why You calling me a playa 
 Why you call me little shorty mack 
 Should be calling me your romeo 
 'Cause I'm looking for my Juliette 
 You say I want my cake and eat it to 
 I'm digging every chick up in this school 
 From time and time again I tell you 
 I got nothing but love 4 u 
 I got nothing but love for you baby 
 Got nothing but love for you baby 
 Cross my heart girl I wouldn't lead you on 
 Nothing but love 
 Nothing but love 
 I've got nothing but love for you baby 
 Just believe these words that I'm saying 
 Got nothing but love for you baby 
 Nothing but love 
 Nothing but love 
 I can't help 
 That half of these chicks in school be digging me 
 Its just who I am 
 Girl you need to know 
 (Oh girl you should know) 
 But I can tell 
 That I want you here right next to me 
 So you be raising hell 
 Time and time again I say 
 I got nothing but love for you baby 
 I got nothing but love for you baby 
 Got nothing but love for you baby 
 Cross my heart girl I wouldn't lead you on 
 Nothing but love 
 Nothing but love 
 I've got nothing but love for you baby 
 Just believe these words that I'm saying 
 Got nothing but love for you baby 
 Nothing but love 
 Nothing but love 
 Wait, Wait hold up 
 Pause 
 Just for a minute 
 'Cause 
 I need a minute 
 To let you know what's really real (real) 
 (You know it) 
 Hold up

 Baby wait

 You think you know what I feel 
 Time and time again I say 
 I got nothing but love for you baby 
 Got nothing but love for you baby 
 Cross my heart girl I wouldn't lead you on 
 Nothing but love 
 Nothing but love {x2}

 Got nothing but love for you baby
