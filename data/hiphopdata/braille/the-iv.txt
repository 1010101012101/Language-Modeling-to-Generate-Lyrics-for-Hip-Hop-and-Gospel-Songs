Yeah, so huh, we got this thing here 
 The IV 
 Yeah yea Braille Brizzy in the place 
 Like this the IV 
 Defines my name 
 Lyricism don't sell no more 
 That's what they say but I just ignore it 
 I won't forfeit, I push forward 
 The fourth record, this is a force to be reckoned with 
 I'm like a wrecking ball tearing down the wall 
 Kick open the door when I step to the bass drum 
 Passion in my lungs, spit till my face is numb, worldwide 
 But I'll never forget where I came from 
 I'm going long-distance with short circuits 
 I'll leave behind more money for more purpose 
 Have you ever heard an emcee like this? 
 I tell it how I see it like an eyewitness 
 Then I broadcast all the true facts 
 12 years in the game, walking a narrow path 
 Climbing uphill, this is dedication 
 Constant elevation, bringing the medication 
 You didn't know you could be the IV did you? 
 The solution to the social issues is you, it's me too 
 If you have the ability to respond, then it's your responsibility 
 Excuses are useless, the truth is it takes more than music to bring forth improvement to this 
 Jungles of concrete, the streets are John Blaze 
 The beats rotate on plates, I speak faith 
 Over the most hopeless circumstances 
 Advance with perseverance and stay focused 
 Take notice, the tapes rolling, smile for the camera 
 High caliber, mark your calendar 
 Revolutionary lyricism, flowing poetic 
 The dialect you'd expect from my genetic inheritance 
 Confidence and arrogance are opposites 
 I'm offering concoctions of hotness, rescue the hostage 
 Hostile with hot styles in piles and piles 
 Travel many miles to arrive right here 
 And survive through the torture and treachery 
 I battle principalities with spiritual weaponry 
 My technique, pose threats like four techs, I blow sets 
 Explosive, I'm on deck, it's code red 
 I touch your brain through your forehead with forceps 
 Squeeze minds instead of triggers 
 I'm on a mission, fully automatic, with phonographic static 
 Opponents mad at it, take them out like bad habits 
 Savage on tracks with milliliters of spit 
 That blast faster than gats or millimeters with clips 
 You feel the beat when it hits cause Marco Polo did it 
 My only limit is the flesh but my soul's infinite 
 Eternal life and internal peace 
 I was infected with sin but I found the IV
