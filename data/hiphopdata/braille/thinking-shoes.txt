Think you wanna walk in another man's shoes 
 Think you wanna do what he do 
 Think you wanna be where he's at 
 I ain't gonna tell ya nothin' new 
 And to the best of my ability every word is true 
 Tell you my story but I'm not the only one 
 As you sit back lookin' at the things that I done 
 How y'all already promised that I wasn't gonna lie 
 So while I rap these words you can look me in the eyes 
 I'm not a perfect man 
 Let's get that out the way 
 But that's not a good reason to stray 
 It's not an excuse when I lose my way 
 These are choices I live with on each new day 
 When I say I'm a blessed man 
 I'm being sincere 
 But don't assume it was easy for me to get here 
 It's never enough 
 Never satisfied unquenchable thirst 
 When the supply is plentiful 
 The workers are few and the sky is heavenful 
 Full of heaven, full of God's majesty shining forever more 
 The more we hold back the more the tension grows 
 The more we keep our eyes on the temporal 
 Permanent residence of the soul is the place of reverence 
 And grace is the evidence that we will face his excellence 
 With faith that's measureless 
 Paved by the footsteps of Christ as he walked to his death 
 Before we resurrected I strive to be intrepid 
 Lay me fear at his feet till the day I'm perfected 
 But he said to me "my grace is sufficient for you. My power is made perfect in your weakness" 
 Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses 
 So that Christs power may rest on me 
 That is why for Christs sake I delight in weaknesses 
 In Insult in hardships in persecutions in difficulties 
 For when I am weak then I am strong
