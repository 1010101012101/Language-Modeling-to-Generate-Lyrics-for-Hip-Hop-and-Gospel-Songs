My darkest hour, was pitch black 
 Rain clouds in the sky, could only see when the lightning strikes 
 Withered flowers, hang with their heads down 
 The weight splashes inside and keeps falling 
 No smiles, beauty hidden for protection 
 Until trampled by shuffling feat 
 Until a new season arrives and brings joy 
 In times of desperation, seeking to be noticed 
 And all I want is to be trimmed of these thorns 
 To seem more inviting to the poor 
 Unfortunate reflection of my selfish existence 
 Can it be? it was all so simplistic 
 Sipping on my sorrow while it's washing it away 
 Trying to add color to these shades of grey 
 And trying to make sense out of all this confusion 
 Embrace my reality and unmask illusions, holograms 
 I advance on a quest with many questions 
 Distracted for a second but I know that I destined 
 Counting my blessing, renewed everyday 
 And I know I'd never grow without these shades of grey 
 What could drive a man off a cliff, lost in thoughts 
 Analyze life to find what's real and what's not 
 Forgotten faces, flashing through my conscience 
 A conquest for freedom, constant forward motion 
 Leaving egypt, past erased from attachment 
 To start from scratch with the bricks that established 
 My true identity, secret to most 
 Deeper then known, I'm keeping it close, to my heart 
 Written on stone tablets, alone in my magic 
 Advice projected, correcting bad habits 
 Laughing as I drowned in mystical tears 
 Mind consumed by thoughts that my physical fears 
 I can't, listen with ears, cause words will deceive 
 As I stand up against darker versions of me 
 Looking over my shoulder, waiting for false moves 
 Dancing around land-mines and get lost in the grove 
 What happens?, when all the light slowly fades away 
 And you try to see god inside a shades of grey 
 He's ever-present, through our mistakes flaws and folly 
 He could have left me falling, but instead he called me 
 And I answered, silent and unsure what to say 
 Just thanking him for life even with the shades of grey 
 This life is unpredictable, no limits or restrictions 
 It's filled with opportunities and filled with addictions 
 So much joy, yet so much affliction 
 Pain and oppression, shame and conviction 
 So much we see yet, so much we're missing 
 So much to change and so much we're fixing 
 Faith and forgiveness, chaos destruction 
 Poverty, paychecks, starving children and corporate lunches 
 Love, peace, war, hate and hunger 
 Fall, winter, spring, summer, sunshine and thunder 
 I'm going under, now I'm rising 
 How much time is left? there's no rewinding 
 Sometimes even the light can seem blinding 
 I wash my thoughts in blood to keep my mind clean 
 I don't have everything I want 
 I've always had everything I needed everything hasn't always went how I planned it 
 But I wouldn't change who I am even if you offered me a mansion 
 Just existing is enough, just living 
 I'll do my best to make the right decisions 
 Until the day heaven takes me away 
 I'm gonna make the most of life even with the shades of grey
