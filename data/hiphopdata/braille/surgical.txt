It's just a friendly game of operation 
 Look at me now just laying here 
 (?) 
 Sometimes you gotta bleed 
 And smell your own blood 
 So cut me open 
 If this is a surgery 
 I'm just strapped down to a operation bed 
 And everyone can see where I bled 
 And cry when I bleed 
 And take turns cuttin' away 
 To extreme for TV the camera cuts away 
 Take the focus off me when I feel the most broken 
 I think about [?] and tabloid gossip 
 Phantom of the opera zombies and monsters 
 Before we put our heads high 
 [?] Double it or nothing 
 We can choose only one side 
 I'm totally tongue tied 
 Crumbilin my words 
 Stay humble and serve 
 But I stumble and swerve 
 Crumble when I hurt 
 I'm not numb to the pain 
 I could feel it but I gotta let it wash down the drain 
 I am not the first man to walk in these shoes 
 Many different roads and pathways to choose 
 Free will yeah the choice is yours 
 Can't walk by sight 
 Cause my eyes get sore when I really want to soar 
 Fly above this 
 Fight against lust and discover what love is 
 (?) 
 Lord please cloth me in righteousness 
 Look away I don't want you to see me like this 
 I don't want to walk away from this life prematurely 
 I can never return once once I leave to early 
 I'm living for God to be a pleasure of him 
 But it's hard to bear fruit [?] the season I'm in 
 I refuse to let the deceiver win 
 I'm the light of the world even when it gets dim 
 I'm the salt of the world even when I'm salt and pepper 
 My lonely heart s so broken and tender 
 Join the club upgrade your membership 
 Get saved before the grave is your residence 
 But I would not reside in the [?] 
 With my bones no would never leave alone 
 I feel like I'm trapped in a nightmare 
 And I can't wake up until the princess will kiss me 
 (?) 
 When I'm full of self doubt envy me 
 Fill me up I'm on bended knee 
 When I repent and turn the temptation flees 
 I am not afraid of the darkness 
 The darkness is afraid of me 
 The heartless they envy me 
 So there is no room for envy or jealousy in me 
 What's gonna matter when it's over? 
 I carry that weight upon my shoulder 
 Who I am as a man a husband a father and son 
 Striven to hear well done 
 In all of the above 
 'Cause I only got one life 
 And I can't do it over
