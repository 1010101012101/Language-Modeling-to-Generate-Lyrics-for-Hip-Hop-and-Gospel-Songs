 I'm Amazing [x8] 
 I became a monster and a killa next LP better then thriller 
 So call me Michael or call me Prince call me an asshole 'cause I'm the shit 
 Call me hutch nigga I'm sick get paid for runnin' my mouth nigga call me a snitch 
 Just face it, it's no replacement I'm just simply marvelous and amazing 
 And no matter what you can't take that from me 
 My range is as far as god eyes can seen 
 I'm amazing 
 Shorty you the shit I said I want shit damn when they wrong 
 Now they in the hood and it's all good bumpin my song, yeah 
 What I want average niggas can't see it 
 That's why when I do y'all niggas can't believe it 
 It's up to me you won't see it till I see it 
 And that means you won't see it till I see it 
 And I'm a do it so good your gunna need it 
 So great don't hate it must be Jesus

 Snuffed on the Grammy what else you want from me man

 My rage is as far as god eyes can see

 Say she all this say she all that 
 What I do know

 Trynna get mine 
 All on my own 
 Am I the most hated in the world 
 And would that change if I was your girl 
 Don't have to do it 'cause I'm already rich 
 Do 'cause I want a man I love this shit 
 Try to keep my smile worth wild 
 But men turn it upside down 
 Radio killa yep that's were I'm at 
 And we did it all with the world on our back 
 And no matter what you can't take that from me 
 My range is as far as god eyes can see 
 I'm amazing [x9]
