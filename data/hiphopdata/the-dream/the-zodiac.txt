 Lately you been leading my way 
 There's something that I wanna say 
 But part of me don't really wanna ask 
 We been getting along so fine 
 The questions tormenting my mind 
 I may not like the answer you give back 
 Forever will you like me, I suffer a bad breakup 
 'Cause we're caught up in what might be 
 Or will we know how to makeup?

 Showed no signs no respect 
 Spent the whole summer being put in check

 And every piece of you has grown on me 
 Warmed up to ya, to a point of no return

 But this only 8 percent 
 As I await your confirmation I feel it burning 
 Think I seen ya birthstone in a ring that you wore
