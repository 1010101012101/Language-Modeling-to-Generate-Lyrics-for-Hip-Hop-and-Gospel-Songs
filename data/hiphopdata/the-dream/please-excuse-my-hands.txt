What's happenin' baby 
 Let ya lil' whoa plies tell you what's goin' on with a man 
 My hands been gettin' me in a lot of trouble so 
 Please excuse my hands 
 They just wanna touch 
 They just wanna feel 
 They don't mean no harm 
 Baby just excuse my hands (whoa whoa) 
 Baby please excuse my hands 
 I apologize they have a one track mind 
 To squeeze on your behind 
 Baby just excuse my hands (whoa whoa) 
 Please excuse my hands 
 With my hands I can make you do a lot of things 
 Have you engagin' in some activities you can't explain 
 Leave my fingerprints on every inch yo damn frame 
 With this one finger I could make you get off the chain 
 Get to lickin' and my hands they get they own brain 
 They wanna touch ya they wanna rub ya they wanna feel your frame 
 Run my hands through your hair and go against your grain 
 Let me massage ya baby and help ease your pain 
 You wanna get comfortable take your shorts off I can help you change 
 Wanna take my hands off but I can't they jus' gon' call your name 
 If I can't squeeze ya and I can't hold ya it don't feel the same 
 It ain't my fault baby my hands is the one to blame 
 I'ma do ya like this and do ya like that 
 I promise you gon' like the way I touch on you 
 So jump up on this biz and let the seat back 
 I promise you gon' like the way I feel on you 
 I'm gonna do ya till yo body say "oh" 
 I'ma do it till your mouth breathes no more 
 I said excuse my hands she said "boy stop playin' and make love to your number one fan" 
 Please excuse my hands 
 Before I kiss ya or make love to ya I wanna touch 
 Can you please face the wall you bout to get strip searched 
 My hands talkin' to me they want now what's under your skirt 
 Let me be the one who do the honors and help you with your shirt 
 My hands don't like to be unemployed they like to work 
 I been told my hands are lil' manish they like to flirt 
 God knows woman the sexy thing you put on is us 
 My hand cravin' your lil' sweet body its gettin' worse 
 I wanna thank you and your body for helpin' me write this verse 
 My hands will never leave your body baby they so loyal 
 Do me a favor look on the dresser and grab that baby oil 
 Ain't got to be the one that do it my hands gon' spoil ya 
 Keep doin' it keep doin' it keep doin' it to me 
 Keep doin' it keep doin' it I swear I'll never leave 
 Keep doin' it keep doin' it keep doin' it shawty shawty 
 Woke up in the spot 
 Yeah the boys on fire 
 I'm wit my nigga plies
