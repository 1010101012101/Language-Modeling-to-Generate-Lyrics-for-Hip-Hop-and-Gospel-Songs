 Oh oh oh aiiii 
 Twitter page 
 Crying 
 Oh yeah . Official 
 Mhmm girl you 
 You have done 
 Something to me I can't just lose 
 You got me handcuffed to your heart 
 And its true 
 I feel nothing unless I'm by you 
 Girllllll girlll 
 Something in my stomach starts to flicker when you are around 
 Something in my soul stars jumping whenever you come around 
 And I will never ever never ever never ever let you down no no 
 And I will never ever never ever never ever dissatisfy you I'll only stand by you 
 So girl I'm putting these words in you and hopefully when I wake up in the morning I've got faith that you'll be right there 
 Cuss all the ones before told you they loved you ; but I'm telling you I really fucking love you girl 
 And all the ones before have told you you're beautiful but I really think you're fucking beautiful girl 
 And all the ones before said that they would take care of you but I really wanna take care of you girl 
 House, car, girl whatever 
 Just put me and you together 
 Want this so bad I don't know why but I'm sure if you don't have me 
 I'll cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry 
 I'll cry 
 Baby can you please listen to me? 
 I may not have the perfect life or big blue eyes 
 But what I got is deeper than the sea 
 Yeaaaa 
 But what I'm willing to give you 
 A million men in the world wouldn't give you ; if they had it to give for free 
 Are you listening to me? (Are you listening to me?) 
 I can't lie 
 You know you can have any man in the world 
 I can't lie 
 You would really be doing me justice to be my girl 
 But don't get it twisted 
 I'm a man in my own words 
 In time ; you will find out that I'm exactly what you deserve 
 Cuss all the ones before told you they loved you ; but I'm telling you I really fucking love you girl 
 And all the ones before have told you you're beautiful but I really think you're fucking beautiful girl 
 And all the ones before said that they would take care of you but I really wanna take care of you girl 
 House, car, girl whatever 
 Just put me and you together 
 Want this so bad and I don't know why but I'm sure if you don't have me 
 I'll cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry cry 
 I'll cry 
 I'm pretty sure that 
 I could see the water flowing down my face like a river 
 I'm pretty sure that 
 Everytime I think about it I just start to shiver 
 I'm pretty sure that 
 I will die on the stake if you don't take me girl 
 I'm pretty sure that, I'm pretty sure that 
 Baby please have me in your world 
 Daa daa daaa 
 Want this so bad and I don't know why but 'im sure if you don't have me
