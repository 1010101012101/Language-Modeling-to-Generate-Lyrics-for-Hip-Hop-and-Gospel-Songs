Jazze Pha: 
 Ladies and gentlemen, 
 You are now tuned in, to the very best 
 Phizzle 
 T.i. 
 Dream 
 Long hair, cute face 
 Big booty, thin waste 
 Breasts so pretty they can't be real 
 They is 
 That's what she'll say 
 She'll play 
 With her girlfriend, tag team on the sex, I give away 
 Get 'em on patrol, for real they 
 Both gon have a field day 
 Never had experience 
 Urgies but they curious 
 So gorgeous and mysterious 
 I'm panty pumpin number one, I'm serious 
 I'm talkin' fast cars, bright lights 
 Big city, long nights 
 Pretty women on site 
 I give it to 'em all night 
 Bright lights 
 Rollin' through the city on that M6 
 Heavy on the radio station 
 Playin' my, oh 
 In a minute she gon be right up on mine 
 And look at youu 
 She ain't had none in a minute so I'm really finna put it on you 
 Just got a text from your man, no he mad, he ain't got a clue 
 You know it 
 He can't love you like I do 
 He can't do it like (I do) 
 He can't do it like (I do) 
 He can't do it like (I do) 
 So go shawty, twirk that, bump it and work that (I do) 
 He can't do it like (I do) 
 You know he can't do it like (I do) 
 He can't do it like (I do) 
 I'm not like him and I'm finna put it on you like 
 Shawty say she got a man but 
 He don't really stand up 
 And that stuff that like he supposed to, all he do is handcuff 
 So she come see me relax 
 Give me love, receive it back 
 Sex her, stetch her body out so much, she say I needed that 
 I'm talkin' primetime pornstar 
 Goin' hard goin' in 
 Ride me like a foreign car 
 Invite a friend to join in 
 I'm talkin' fast cars, bright lights 
 Big city, long nights 
 Pretty women on site 
 I give it to 'em all night 
 Catch me in the old school, new school 
 Vert drop, hard top 
 See me and at least 2 freaks pulled over in the parkin lot 
 Engaged in conversation yo and listenin to the radio 
 Give it to 'em ruff, they say but treat 'em like a lady tho 
 She never kissed a girl before 
 But fantasized bout girls before 
 Imagine havin' sex with women, jus don't want the world to know 
 I'm talkin' fast cars, bright lights 
 Big city, long nights 
 Pretty women on site 
 I give it to 'em all night
