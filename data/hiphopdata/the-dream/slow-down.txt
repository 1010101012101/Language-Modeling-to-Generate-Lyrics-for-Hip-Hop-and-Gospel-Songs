When I tell you that I love you 
 You always need proof 
 But a good dude shouldn't have to 
 We got nothing to lose 
 Girl were to young to be worried about who to trust 
 You could be the one 
 We'll never know if your afraid to mess up 
 Slow down 
 Swear it's all in your head 
 Slow down 
 I ain't goin' nowhere 
 See the thing about love is we think about it to much 
 Slow down 
 (Take it slow, take it slow) 
 Slow down 
 (Take it slow, take it slow) 
 Slow down 
 I hear your girlfriends 
 They be talking 
 Like they judge less of you 
 We got a good thing 
 Can you blame them 
 'Cause I would be to 
 Girl were to young to be worried about who to trust 
 You could be the one 
 We'll never know if your afraid to mess up 
 Slow down 
 Swear it's all in your head 
 Slow down 
 I ain't goin' nowhere 
 See the thing about love is we think about it to much 
 Slow down 
 (Take it slow, take it slow) 
 Slow down 
 (Take it slow, take it slow) 
 Slow down 
 I don't really wanna rush this love 
 Don't plan on letting it go 
 To good to ever wanna give up 
 I just wanna let you know 
 Take it slow baby let it go [x3] 
 Slow down 
 Swear it's all in your head 
 Slow down 
 I ain't goin' nowhere 
 See the thing about love is we think about it to much 
 Slow down 
 (Take it slow, take it slow) 
 Slow down 
 (Take it slow, take it slow) 
 Slow down
