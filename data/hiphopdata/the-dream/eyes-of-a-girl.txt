From Venus to Mars 
 Girl you're standing right here 
 Sometimes it feels we're worlds apart 
 What am I to do 
 I'll always take the blame 
 I'm the first to change 
 I thought that's what good girls do 
 If every boy was a girl for a day 
 Then you would understand 
 What it's like to be me 
 If only you could think through the eyes of a girl [x2] 
 To tell you the truth 
 You couldn't handle the truth 
 If I think of things 
 That you would do 
 I don't really think 
 You would like the view 
 Through the eyes of a girl 
 It's your point of view 
 You only see what's there 
 To what a woman really needs 
 Open up before it's too late 
 If I'm the love of your life 
 With that able to beside 
 All I ask for is equality 
 Could you walk a mile in my shoes? 
 Are you strong enough to endure? 
 If you struggle closing doors 
 Pain goes unnoticed 
 The flock doesn't notice you 
 Hey boy you need a change of view
