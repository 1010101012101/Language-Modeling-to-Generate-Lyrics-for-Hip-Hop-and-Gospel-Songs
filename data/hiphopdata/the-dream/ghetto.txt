Rolly on my arm, let me get my swagga back 
 Jesus on my charm, Amen to that 
 Laid back in the Maybach 57 or 62 
 Floating down the coast in the helicopter 
 Shawty, that's what I do, I'm gettin' stacks of this on accident 
 My daughter's 5, what's that mean? 
 My daughter's daughter is already rich 
 I'm gettin' evolved, quit playing simp 
 I'm simply pimping record labels, nigga look at my limp 
 She says she missed riding it 
 I say I miss her on me, holdin' it down 
 I certainly miss how she grind's it 
 And she says she miss havin' me around 
 She all up on me singin' my songs 
 And it feel like I'm fuckin' my fan 
 And screamin' "don't let go! Baby you already know" 
 Climaxing, hold my hand, she runnin' it back, workin it 
 Like you don't understand 
 (Mr, she sayin', she singin') 
 She wants that old thing back 
 That ride it like up on it 
 That "get up in the morning and put it on me" 
 She's so horny, she wants that old thing back 
 That "mm-hmm, gimme some" 
 Rocket ship, that rocket ship 
 Don't stop until I'm done 
 She wants that ghetto, ghetto and I got that ghetto 
 Ghetto, ghetto and I got that ghetto 
 Ghetto, ghetto and I got that ghetto 
 She want that Ghetto, she need that ghetto 
 That Ghetto, ghetto and I got that ghetto 
 Ghetto, ghetto, she want that ghetto 
 She need that ghetto, she want that ghetto 
 Ghetto, ghetto, that mm-hmm ghetto 
 She said "Dream do it to me like this 
 Why can't you do it to me like that?" 
 For the last 48 months, you can't front I put that ass on the map 
 I created this sound, yes sir I shut it down 
 There's only one number 1 
 These other niggas are my sons 
 And you can never be be like me, you can never do it do it like me 
 Ain't none of these niggas seeing me 
 Ain't none of these niggas repeating me 
 Ain't none of these niggas defeating me 
 Unless they get me to murk myself... 
 I just murk myself 
 She wants that old thing back 
 That ride it like up on it 
 That "get up in the morning and put it on me" 
 She's so horny, she wants that old thing back 
 That "mm-hmm, gimme some" 
 Rocket ship, that rocket ship don't stop till I'm done 
 She wants that ghetto, ghetto and I got that ghetto 
 Ghetto, ghetto and I got that ghetto 
 Ghetto, ghetto and I got that ghetto 
 She want that Ghetto, she need that ghetto 
 That Ghetto, ghetto and I got that ghetto 
 Ghetto, ghetto, she want that ghetto 
 She need that ghetto, she want that ghetto 
 Ghetto, ghetto, that mm-hmm ghetto 
 Real niggas on the wishlist, used to blow me off 
 Now she tryna blow me kisses 
 Walk in to the room, tell me how couldn't I miss it? 
 Girl, you working like you need assistance, tipping 
 Girl you workin like you need a pension 
 Bend that thang over, let a nigga pinch it 
 Rich nigga shit: I could put you on a boat 
 Popping champagne, now you look like its Big Pimpin' 
 I work all day, fuck all night, finna make you cuss all night 
 "Shit fuck damn!" lemme know I do it right 
 Pussy so good I'mma have to do it twice 
 Bend over let a real nigga taste that 
 Fuck around, need a placemat 
 See my call log, a nigga has to erase that 
 Send me a text, smiley face chat saying: 
 (She want that old thing back) 
 Wanna show you how much I appreciate you 
 Wanna show you how much I'm dedicated to you 
 Wanna show you how much I will forever be true 
 Wanna show you how much have a nigga feeling good 
 Wanna show you how much how much you're understood 
 Wanna show you how much I value what you say 
 Not only are you loyal, you're patient with me, baby 
 Wanna show you how much I care about your heart 
 Wanna show you how much I don't like being apart 
 Wanna show you, show you, show you till you're hearing me 
 Keep it how it is so we can never say how it used to be.
