(Talking) 
 If a was your man, I 
 Hit that shit like A-Rod 
 Don't you understand I, I 
 Trying to be ur favorite artist in ur ipod 
 I know this wasn't planned I 
 What I got is love 
 What he got nothing 
 Take this chance 
 He ain't nothin' to lose 
 So why you lookin' all confused 
 Girls like you 
 Turn men like me into haters 
 And I must admit it 
 Been actin' like a hater 
 Tryin' to get it 
 You got me lookin' like a hater 
 Soon as she said she had a man 
 I was a hater 
 As long as I get you 
 I'll be a hater 
 Until you say you love me too 
 I'll be a hater 
 He don't even know 
 I'm his hater 
 How did one look at you overtake the kind heart in me 
 Say you'll leave your man so I 
 Can hit that shit like a parked car 
 Money ain't a thang I 
 Get it all with a swipe of the black card 
 Pretty woman get up in this Bentley now 
 You be my Julia I'll be ur Richard 
 Can't wait to pin ur frame on my wall 
 I need you in my picture 
 Do anything to get u
