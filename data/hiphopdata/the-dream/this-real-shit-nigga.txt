See I could give a fuck what a nigga thinks 
 As long as I keep popping bottles of that drink 
 And I could give a fuck what a nigga do 
 As long as I've got Rollies on my whole crew 
 You think I give a fuck? nigga look at my truck 
 Matter of fact, look at my girl 
 Look at my Benz motherfucker, look at my friends 
 All us niggas got ends 
 Look at my shit, nigga look at my watch 
 Look at my muthafuckin' drop, look at my yacht, boy stop 
 Look at all the shit you ain't got 
 This shit real nigga 
 The shit real in the field 
 Real nigga now, leave it in the will 
 Shit real nigga

 Diddy on the phone: "nigga get your swagger right!" 
 J told me to drop it on your head: swagger tight 
 Nigga spending money like I just won a settlement 
 Ever seen a nigga buy a Porsche off the internet? 
 Ever seen a nigga buy a house from the toilet? 
 Add a boat to the cart, click "yes" - bought it! 
 So nigga stop acting like we don't know killas too 
 Fucking with my money like I don't know gorilla's too 
 Chris told me get my money, get the fuck up out the trap 
 That was 99 and I ain't looked back 
 And Jayceon said hit him if I ever had a problem 
 Don't worry about it, come through he'll solve em 
 Just pay for the lawyers, nigga fuck them charges 
 I could give a fuck what a nigga thinks 
 As long as I keep popping bottles of that drink 
 And I could give a fuck what a nigga do 
 As long as I've got Rollies on my whole crew
