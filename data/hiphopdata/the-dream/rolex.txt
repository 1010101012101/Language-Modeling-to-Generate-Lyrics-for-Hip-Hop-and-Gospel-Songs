Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, (what up Rozay) 
 This is Rolex music 
 Sittin' in the back of that 62, just me and my boo 
 Radio Killer music 
 We always with the baddest hoes, fuck the status quo 
 You can't see me, you can't see me 
 Give a fuck what you think, blowing bottles of that drink 
 You can't see me, you can't see me 
 Shawty we shut it down, down, down, you can't see me 
 Red Ferrari, me and my cutie pie 
 Blowing money fast, Westside shawty till I die 
 Back to the haters, wind in my face 
 Louis Vuitton shades, Levis jeans 
 And I feel like Master P cause my cards ain't got limit 
 Pull a black Visa - buy a black Jesus 
 My nigga Chris say he can't imagine what this is 
 Can't wait till you get home, nigga look how we living 
 Waking up, breaking up with the baddest bitches 
 I heard my cousin told his mother "that nigga gettin' it" 
 So this one goes out to them haters, fuck you and your blank stare 
 Arm out the window, smiley face, Rollie in the air 
 This is Rolex music 
 Sittin' in the back of that 62, just me and my boo 
 Radio Killer music 
 We always with the baddest hoes, fuck the status quo 
 You can't see me, you can't see me 
 Give a fuck what you think, blowing bottles of that drink 
 You can't see me, you can't see me 
 Shawty we shut it down, down, down, you can't see me 
 You already know what it is when you see me 
 Radio Killa straight out of the C P T 
 Compton if you didn't know, westside till I die 
 Hair down my back, Gucci Print on the bag 
 Cali swagger, Rollie on my arm 
 See I been to hell and back, and I put that on my mom 
 And now I'm in the building with the hottest nigga doing it 
 Got to get that money baby, that's why I'm pursuing it 
 It's a celebration when them gold presidential links 
 Are wrapped around your wrist, yeah, shawty is the shit 
 So this song's for them haters, fuck you and your blank stare 
 Smiley face, Rollie way up in the motherfucking air 
 This is Rolex music 
 Sittin' in the back of that 62, just me and my boo 
 Radio Killer music 
 We always with the baddest hoes, fuck the status quo 
 You can't see me, you can't see me 
 Give a fuck what you think, blowing bottles of that drink 
 You can't see me, you can't see me 
 Shawty we shut it down, down, down, you can't see me
