Mama 
 I wanted to take you home to my mama 
 I wanted to take you home to my mama 
 I wanted to take you home to my mama but no (but no) 
 What 
 What 
 What we had was awsome 
 Till he came in took you out my life 
 I even had thoughts of makin' her my wife 
 And I thought that this dough would keep her by my side 
 (By my siiide) 
 I can't call her even tho right now the boys in need 
 But needin her wont bring her back to me 
 I can't believe this girl ain't by my side this shit ain't right 
 Any thing she wanted I bought it 
 Broke my neck to make sure that this girl didn't go without it 
 I can't hate the homie 
 'Cause I am the blame instead of lovin' you I was makin' it rain 
 He took my shawty 
 He took my girl 
 He took the any and every thing out my world 
 He took my heart from me 
 He took my soul 
 I should have known that money couldn't match love 
 (It ain't no match) 
 A yeah ayeah ayeahaa ayeah ayeah ayeahaa (there it is) ayeah ayeah ayeahaa ayeah ayeah ayeah 
 Now what they got is differant 
 And when it came to love I didn't take the time (the time, the time, the time) 
 He got it right 
 And all this time I was kissin' her good bye good byiiii 
 An I can't call her 
 Even tho right now the boys in need 
 But needin her wont bring her back to meee 
 I can't breath 
 And I got heart aches like you wouldn't believe 
 Hey 
 Every thing she wanted I bought it 
 Broke my neck to make sure that this girl didn't go without it 
 I can't hate the homie 
 'Cause I am the blame instead of lovin' you I was makin' it rain 
 He took my shawty 
 He took my girl 
 He took the any and every thing out my world 
 He took my heart from me 
 He took my soul 
 I should have known that money couldn't match love

 And tell her you love her don't let her go

 No matter what you got any body could leave you
