I jump up out my bed grab my clothes 
 And I throw on my coat out the door 
 And I?m, today I'm gonna get over you, you, you 
 Yeah, and I hop in the car 
 Push the button on the automatic start 
 Right on the seat I see a scarf I gave to you 
 Oh, memories start comin' back 
 No room for reverse I can't back back 
 I'm sittin' in the car but I can't back back 
 So, I'm slumped over the wheel of the car 
 And all I can think of is a broken heart 
 And all I can think of is why we're apart 
 We went round for round 
 Till we knocked love out 
 We were laying in the ring not making a sound 
 And if that's a metaphor of you and I 
 Why is it so hard to say goodbye 
 I can't wait to hate you 
 Oh, the things you put me through 
 I wanna move on 
 I can't wait to hate you 
 Oh, the days you left my heart all alone 
 I can't wait to hate you 
 This is all crazy 
 And I can't come to grips with the fact that you're gone 
 I can't wait to hate you 
 Ooh Oh 
 Jump up out my bed grab my clothes 
 And I throw on my coat out the door 
 And I?m, today I'm gonna get over you 
 Press the button on the automatic start 
 Right on the seat I see a scarf I gave to you 
 Oh, memories start comin' back 
 No room for reverse I can't back back 
 I'm sittin' in the car but I can't back back 
 So, I'm slumped over the wheel of the car 
 And all I can think of is a broken heart 
 And all I can think of is why we're apart
