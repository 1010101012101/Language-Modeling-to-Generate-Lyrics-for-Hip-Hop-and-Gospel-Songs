I hate to have to crash your wedding with this shit 
 Let me sing you my drunk song 
 I hate to have to crash your wedding, but here it is 
 Let me sing you my anthem 
 I hate to have to crash your wedding with this shit 
 Let me sing you my drunk song 
 I hate to have to crash your wedding (my anthem), but here it is 
 I'ma be missing you forever 
 We still should be together 
 I'm already on my third ring 
 These bitches ain't even on your level 
 I tried to replace you with my ex and 
 The ex before that - had me all miserable when you left 
 Everything went left, still got some of your things 
 If you want, I'll send them to you 
 I'd rather send you my love even though I know it's passed due 
 See, it's going on 8 years 
 Baptizing in my tequila tears 
 All the lights off, I'm all alone 
 Just me and this bottle of Patron 
 Singing you my drunk song 
 (I hate to have to crash your wedding with this shit) 
 This my motherfucking anthem 
 (I hate to have to crash your wedding, but here it is) 
 Oh baby this my drunk song 
 (I hate to have to crash your wedding with this shit) 
 It's what I sing when you're not around 
 Baby it's my anthem, my anthem 
 (I hate to have to crash your wedding) 
 All you wanted was my heart and soul 
 And I was walking 'round so cold 
 And now every girl I tried to replace you with is 
 Just a name on a payroll - you get it? 
 Shawty you the shit and it's nice to see you 
 Hop up out of that new 6 - congratulations! 
 I know you're looking forward to your wedding day 
 It's been so long, damn shit's changed 
 She's just another girl on the blog 
 She can never compare to how beautiful you are 
 See, you're right I'm wrong 
 So long, I'm gone 
 Just me and my bottle of Patron 
 Singing you my drunk song 
 (I hate to have to crash your wedding with this shit) 
 This my motherfucking anthem 
 (I hate to have to crash your wedding, but here it is) 
 Baby this my drunk song 
 (I hate to have to crash your wedding with this shit) 
 It's my motherfucking anthem, my anthem 
 (I hate to have to crash your wedding) 
 I know you're probably not thinking 'bout me 
 But I'm here thinking 'bout you 
 Know it might be a little late 
 To admit that I was just afraid 
 Cause now I'm on a lone train 
 And I hope I get off, 'cause I'm sure the next stop is cocaine 
 Or some other drug 
 Right now, my heart's all numb 
 Bet you're wondering where it's all coming from 
 Oh 
 Baby this my drunk song 
 (I hate to have to crash your wedding with this shit) 
 This my motherfucking anthem 
 (I hate to have to crash your wedding, but here it is) 
 Oh baby this my drunk song 
 (I hate to have to crash your wedding with this shit) 
 What I sing when you're not around 
 Motherfucking anthem, anthem 
 Baby, this my drunk song 
 And I'm just shakin' my head, my head, my head 
 My anthem 
 Must admit, baby, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared 
 Drunk song 
 And I'm just shakin' my head, my head, my head 
 My anthem 
 Admit that I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared 
 I'm lost without you (nigga sing that shit) 
 I've been lost without you (nigga sing that shit) 
 Lost without you (nigga sing that shit) 
 I've been lost without you (nigga sing that shit) 
 It's just me and this bottle of Patron 
 You I won't forget 
 I hate to have to crash your wedding with this shit 
 Drunk song
