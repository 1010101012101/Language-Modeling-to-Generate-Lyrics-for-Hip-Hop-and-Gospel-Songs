Shorty, I really wanted to be everything you need 
 Come on, come on, come on baby 
 Who knows what would've happened if you stayed that, that night with me 
 Come on, come on, come on baby 
 I told you to come and get with me, promise I wouldn't leave you 
 Come on, come on, come on baby 
 You never thought that he would be the one, one, one, one to deceive you 
 Come on, come on, come on baby 
 Now it's awful cold in the house he bought you 
 And I've gotten over living without you 
 Springtime, summertime, falltime, winter 
 And all of our love we had just starting to remember 
 But you was off the game 
 And everything done changed 
 'Cause now I'm making love to Nikki 
 And I don't feel bad and no I ain't sad 
 'Cause I been making love to Nikki 
 He was the one that you ran to 
 The one you gave your hand to 
 So don't say you didn't plan to 
 So every time that you think of me 
 Know I been making love to Nikki 
 Love to Nikki 
 She loves me back 
 Now everything that he told you when you were with me, you believed it 
 Come on, come on, come on baby 
 Considering the fact that it was you, you were the one that was cheating 
 Come on, come on, come on baby 
 He told you I was with the girl up in The Palms 
 We up in the studio, shorty all on my arms 
 We all up at the park throwing back shots at patron 
 My whole life was in a lane, what kind of shit were you on 
 But it's awfull cold in the house he bought you 
 And I've gotten over living without you 
 So springtime, summertime, falltime, winter 
 I'm here to leave you with the last thing you remember 
 See you was off the game 
 But now everything is changed 
 'Cause I've been making love to Nikki 
 And no I ain't mad, hell no I ain't sad 
 Shorty I been making love to Nikki 
 He was the one that you ran to 
 The one you gave your hand to 
 So don't say you didn't plan to 
 And every time that you think of me 
 Know I been making love to Nikki 
 Love to Nikki 
 And she loves me back 
 She loves me back 
 She she she she loves me back 
 She loves me, she she she she loves me back 
 She loves me 
 And now you calling me saying you didn't mean to do me wrong 
 You've died in my heart, so go ahead and live in his arms 
 My loves out the window, that's if you didn't know 
 Peace up A-town ride out 
 'Cause I'm sitting in the six-four, 
 Girl as the wind blow, baby imma ride out 
 When you heart is broken, 
 Go ahead pick it, go ahead pick it up 
 Go ahead suck it up 
 You was off the game 
 Now everything is changed 
 I've been making love to Nikki 
 Now...
