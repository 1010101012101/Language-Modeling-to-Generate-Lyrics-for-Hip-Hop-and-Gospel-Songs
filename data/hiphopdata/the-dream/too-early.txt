You've given up my loving 
 You've given up my touch 
 You're leaving me with nothing 
 Not even a piece of mine 
 Uh baby, uh baby 
 You've given up my pleasure 
 You've given up my joy 
 You leave me with no aspirations 
 Your love I can't afford 
 Uh, uh, uh, baby 
 My heart turn but the pills do 
 Car no, and the rent due 
 Know what you done, 
 But I'ma be a fool 
 To be was to play it cool 
 So many things I could do to you 
 Black out, the cops come 
 Can't see me daughters, can't see my sons 
 When I come home undone 
 'Cause it's too early in the morning 
 To break love and then to make out 
 It's too late for pretending 
 And I'ma stop now 
 I see my silhouette at the sunset with my top down 
 See me ride, million dollar benz, real fly 
 Top down, gold watch, a hunned stacks band on my glock 
 See me ride, million dollar benz, real fly 
 Top down, gold watch, a hunned stacks band on my glock 
 Even pretty girls get left too 
 Sugar honey, all the time 
 I used to love to undress you 
 Now I pay it don't never mind 
 Uh, uh, uh, baby 
 Gave you all the affection 
 You gave me 4 years of rain 
 It's been 40 days and 40 nights 
 Soaking in pain 
 My heart turn but the pills do 
 Car no, and the rent due 
 Baby girl, life's hard and know 
 You too fast, I can't keep up 
 So many things I could do to you 
 Black out, the cops come 
 Can't see me daughters, can't see my sons 
 When I come home undone 
 'Cause it's too early in the morning 
 To break love and then to make out 
 It's too late for pretending 
 And I'ma stop now 
 I see my silhouette at the sunset with my top down 
 See me ride, million dollar benz, real fly 
 Top down, gold watch, a hunned stacks band on my glock 
 See me ride, million dollar benz, real fly 
 Top down, gold watch, a hunned stacks band on my glock.
