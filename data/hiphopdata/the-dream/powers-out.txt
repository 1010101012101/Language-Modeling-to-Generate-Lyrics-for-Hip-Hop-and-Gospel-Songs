I got a shoulder built for you, 
 Just in case you need it to lean on. 
 These hands I have are for you, 
 Just in case you need help, hold on! 
 The world is just a super sized merry go round, 
 Sometimes your fingers lose it's grip, we all fall down. 
 Don't sit there in the dark, don't worry your heart. 
 Everything will be fine, if trees fall on your power line. 
 If the winds turn strong, 
 You will always have a home, 
 If your powers out. 
 If the light turns dark, 
 You can stay here on my heart, 
 If your power's out. 
 My food is yours, 
 Take all you want. Yeah. 
 My bed is yours, 
 Sleep all you want. Yeah. 
 I have clothes here for you, 
 If it's twenty below, will warm pass your cold. 
 I have room just for you, 
 Pillows, blankets, and a bowl of soup. 
 Now I will be the place for your lost and found, 
 What's mine is yours just point it out. 
 Don't sit there in the dark, don't worry your heart 
 Everything will be fine, if a tree falls on your power line. 
 If the winds turn strong, 
 You will always have a home, 
 If your powers out. 
 If the light turns dark, 
 You can stay here on my heart, 
 If your power's out. 
 My food is yours, 
 Take all you want. Yeah 
 My bed is yours, 
 Sleep all you want. 
 My food is yours, 
 Take all you want. Yeah 
 My bed is yours, 
 Sleep all you want. Yeah 
 If the winds turn strong, 
 You will always have a home, 
 If your powers out.
