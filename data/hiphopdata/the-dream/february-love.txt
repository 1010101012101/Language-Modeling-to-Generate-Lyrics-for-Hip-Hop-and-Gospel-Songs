Come and walk me to the car 
 I wanna see you from here to there 
 Can't help but stare 
 Give me some insight 
 No bullshit 
 A real conversation 
 Put me on your block 
 I'm moving in 
 I would love to be love's neighbor 
 If you don't mind I don't mind 
 Do anything for just a fraction of you 
 And I know this may sound stalkerish 
 But that's because you are the shit 
 All right 
 If I'm attention 
 Be my center 
 If you're Spring I'm Summer 
 If you're Fall I'm Winter 
 Speaking of Winter 
 Be my February love 
 Love 
 Love 
 My love 
 Be my February love 
 Love 
 Love 
 Give me your heart 
 Give me your heart 
 Promise we'll never be apart 
 I know your used to them niggas saying wha-ah-ah-hatever 
 Promise we'll always be to-to-to-together 
 Take a picture 
 I'll buy the frame 
 Let me change your car 
 Then change your name 
 You are my destiny child 
 Now lets make us a destiny child 
 Girl rock with me 
 Quench the curiosity 
 I'm positive that we are meant to be 
 Don't let them spoil it with negativity 
 All right 
 See we are the beautiful ones 
 Baby come and step into my side 
 Before the cold takes it away 
 Come and be my February love 
 Love 
 Love 
 Girl be my February love 
 Love 
 Love 
 Phantom in the driveway 
 Sittin' on the court side 
 Shawty I ain't new to this 
 You better get used to this 
 30 foot ceilings 
 Lifestyle appealin' 
 Check my '09 taxes I made a killing 
 Haters wanna kill'em 
 Real niggas feel'em 
 Dream ain't on the credits 
 They must'a got a fill in 
 Uh 
 He's so silly 
 Don't mean to be rude 
 But some of these niggas just ain't got a clue 
 Fallin' in love 
 Follow me girl 
 These niggas so scandalous 
 These comedian niggas should do stand-up 
 These breakup before holiday ass niggas 
 Them leasing Benzes pretendin ass niggas 
 Hell yeah I already told you niggas I'm a motherfuckin' hater 
 Especially when y'all niggas lying about your motherfuckin' paper 
 He poppin' champagne 
 Throwin' out Benjamins all up on the TV screen 
 Don't own your publishing 
 Hell nawh you ain't got more money than me 
 Just help me understand 
 Help me comprehend 
 Matter fact don't tell me shit 
 She know you full of it 
 It's so much that I can say 
 She pullin' me away 
 Stay in the way 
 They like my February love 
 Love 
 Love 
 She was my February love 
 Love 
 Love
