Wake me when it's over 
 Wake me when it's over 
 I hate it when you go 
 I love to watch you leave 
 I hate the way you talk to me 
 I love you in them jeans 
 You so disrespectful 
 But damn I love your style 
 But shit, you're so neglectful 
 How long have you been out? 
 What have you been drinking? 
 What have I been doing? 
 Where I was last night? 
 Did you mean who I've been screwing? 
 Life on the internet 
 I look like a devil 
 But you wearing the red dress 
 Holding a shovel 
 Tried to keep it hush for you, keep it on the low 
 Tried to spare your feelings 
 Shut the door 
 You knew it was over. 
 I knew it was over. 
 Everyone knew it was over. 
 Wake me when it's over. 
 Yeah yeah I love the way you smell 
 But you always on some bullshit 
 I love how your body feels 
 Why must we do this 
 Stop with the excuses 
 I hate procrastination 
 You never had no one like me 
 Well why you so complacent 
 Now I'm feelin' crazy, and foolish 
 I hate that I'm inpatient 
 Damn we look so stupid 
 It was all down hill when you let them in our business 
 Thought that I could save you then we died in the abyss 
 Raise your hand if he was there, I I I 
 Raise your hand if you care, I I I 
 But I'll bite the bullet for your love 
 I'll cock back and pull it for your love. 
 You knew it was over, I know you did 
 I knew it was over, you knew I did 
 Everyone knew it was over, 
 So wake me when it's over. 
 It's so easy to throw you under that bus 
 That you riding on 
 It's so easy to take you off that cloud 
 That you call home 
 It's so easy to expose 
 Those who you love the most 
 But it's so hard to disregard 
 And keep your mouth closed 
 I'll take the bullets 
 You can pull it ow 
 Raise your hand if you care, I I I 
 Raise your hand if you were there, I I I 
 Got me out here 
 Takin' takin' takin' takin' takin' bullets 
 Even though you knew it was over 
 And I knew that it was over 
 All our friends knew it was over 
 Now just wake me when it's over 
 Yeah yeah yeah... 
 La la la la la...
