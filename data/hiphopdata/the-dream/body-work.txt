Here's a little somethin' about my ex's, she thought she was a super freak 
 She thought the sex was incredible... until she met me 
 I've done around the clock, twenty-eleven times a week 
 If ya under 18, mom and dad put your kids to sleep 
 She couldn't wait to lick it and I couldn't wait to stick it 
 And every time I break it, it would take a whole day to fix it 
 She said: "listen to me baby, I know one day you go up and leave" 
 She know I'm a virgo and I'm impossible to please 
 Look into my eyes, turned around got on her knees 
 She said: "i know you a cheater, but boy before you leave" 
 Fuck my brains out, babay x4 
 Fuck my brains out 
 Yeah 
 She's screamin' "love me baby" 
 -Fuck my brains out- 
 Here's a little somethin' about my ex's, she thought she was a super freak 
 Until I sucked that little body and left her layin' in the sheets 
 I got ya talkin' with my tongue, till she couldn't speak 
 The sweets to her sugar's low, chillin' weak 
 -It's all about you baby!- 
 She said: "let's shoot video pictures" so she don't forget it 
 Then she start cryin', look right in the camera 
 The mascara's runnin', said "baby what's the matter?" 
 She said: "listen to me baby, I know one day you go up and leave" 
 She know I'm a virgo and I'm impossible to please 
 Look into my eyes, turned around got on her knees 
 She said: "i know you a cheater, but boy before you leave" 
 Fuck my brains out, babay x4 
 I know, I know, I know you do love me baby 
 I know, I know, I know it, yeah 
 I know, I know, I know you want it baby- 
 Say it first, I know I'll be right there (?) 
 She said 
 "Take my only heart, do me one more time before the world (ends?) 
 I'll always miss... that kiss" 
 Our lover's delight!
