(Feat. R. Kelly) 
 Allow me to re-introduce myself 
 {I got a surprise for y'all} 
 It's the American Dream from the A... 
 I'm with my big homie Kellz 
 Well, shawty listen. It's the remix 
 No other than, your boyfriend, Kellz 
 And we roll up to the club like "aye" 
 And we all up in the club like "aye" 
 Tell security to move the ropes back 
 Let the chicks in, we in the VIP poppin' bottles. 
 Man I'm off that patron, clownin and carryin on 
 I'm so drunk that ugly girls look like supermodels 
 However I'm in the building, and I'm ballin how a baller do 
 So many honeys in the building, y'all know I'm playin' it like a player do 
 I walk up to one girl, and she's got her friend with her 
 Peppin to a real... baby I'm a go getta 
 The girl I meet got a nice booty; otha girl's is much bigga 
 Ask me how I do 'em both, I'm kellz... go figure 
 Ooh (hey) 
 Then go to Kellz on the remix 
 Ooh (hey) 
 And haters wanna hate 'cause I'm the S*! + 
 I'm the s***, Kellz is the sh**, I'm the sh** 
 And shawty is the s***, She's the s***, together we the sh**, we the sh** (oh oh) 
 (You must be the American Dream) 
 I got to show my respect so Kelly had to go first (I) 
 I'm a put my shawty to bed after this verse (I) 
 Flam's poppins all up in the phantom 
 I'm all up her hair like dandruff 
 Shawty so cool, booty so cute 
 Shawty is the ish, so I is too. 
 So you can call yo man and tell 'em that you ain't coming back 
 I got pockets full of stacks, she staying where she at 
 Ish happens when you don't treat your girl right 
 Put it on the "aye" all it takes is a night 
 Now she 'round here doing everything I like, I like 
 If shawty keep it real with you, you should tip her, you should tip her 
 But if she gone all night and got more money than you, umm, she just might be a stipper 
 It was Keishia, from the "Chi" 
 Tonya, from the "A" 
 Sonya, from "Huston" 
 Monique from the "Bay" 
 Neci from "Seattle" 
 KiKi to New York 
 Now when I see you on 23 all I can say... 
 You know we had to do a remix... mix 
 Kelly and Dream, you already know 
 "Shawty is a hit, a hit" [x4] 
 Shawty is the... shawty is the... let me leave my girlfriend quick [x3] 
 (It's the remix) make me leave my girlfriend quick [x2] 
 (It's the remix) It's Kellz and Dream
