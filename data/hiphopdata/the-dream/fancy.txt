First Verse 
 Through the sheets, she climbs her way up to this bed singing melodies 
 Run my fingers in her hair and say come to me 
 First there is a no, then she says yes baby 
 She's the Dream of a billion men 
 Go girl ay hiiiiiii iii 
 Go girl ay hiiiiiii iiiii 
 See she made her way from nothing 
 Can't fault her for wanting something 
 She loves men that can afford (yeah) 
 She wants to, live fancy 
 Trips to Monaco, designer names from head to toe (they're fancy) 
 On planes that fly clean across the golden skies 
 Brilliant cars, Spend evenings under the stars (live fancy) 
 Diamond rings ooh ooh ooh o 
 All those things... live fancy (4x) 
 (Second Verse) 
 She spends her time 
 Aboard yachts if not, somewhere tasting wine 
 In Paris seducing me while we dine 
 She's only 23, but ahead of her time 
 She's the Dream of a billion men 
 Go Girl 
 See she made her way from nothing 
 Can't fault her for wanting something 
 She loves men that can afford (yeah) 
 She wants to, live fancy 
 Trips to Monaco, designer names from head to toe (they're fancy) 
 On planes that fly clean across the golden skies (live fancy) 
 Brilliant cars, Spend evenings under the stars (live fancy) 
 Diamond rings ooh ooh ooh o 
 All those things... live fancy (4x) 
 (Third Verse) 
 Cause of me all she do, is walk around in Italian shoes 
 She's probably a girl you used to know 
 I can see her beauty with both eyes closed 
 But you didn't notice she fell in love with what she noticed 
 That I'm fancy 
 Trips to Monaco, designer names from head to toe (I'm fancy) 
 On planes that fly clean across the golden skies (I'm fancy) 
 Brilliant cars, Spend evenings under the stars (I'm fancy) 
 Diamond rings ooh ooh ooh o 
 All those things... (I live fancy) (8x) 
 You can be from the hood, but I know you wanna live fancy (Shorty, throw yo hands up) 
 East Side, West Side, South Side, but you wanna live fancy (If you fly throw ya sign up) 
 She's wit me, 'cause she wanna to live fancy (Anything she want I will provide her) 
 I'm with her, 'cause she's B.e.a.u.t.i.f.u.l. (and you know I can't deny her) 
 ...And deserving, oh yeah 
 She's deserving 
 ***Extended Version*** 
 She all on me 'cause all I do is ride around the Bentleys coups 
 Got no need she got me buying her them Fendi shoes 
 All we do is shop until we drop right there in the floor 
 All we do is make love in foreign places till we can't no more 
 They say you can't buy love, man they lying 
 If Christian LaCroix brings a smile, I'm buying 
 If she wanna make love on the edge of the world, I'll buy it 
 Have anything she want 'cause she my girl, just say it, she got it 
 I'm flyer than flyin in G-O jets 
 No first class, coach class no disrespect 
 Out my New York apartment to JFK 
 On the helicopter, cause the pilot's goin' my way 
 I'm wildly swervin' in Bentley whips 
 Don't even have to watch how I spend my chips, no 
 From Dollars to dineros, I'm every nigga's hero 
 Cause even when I used to rock Polo I was (fancy)
