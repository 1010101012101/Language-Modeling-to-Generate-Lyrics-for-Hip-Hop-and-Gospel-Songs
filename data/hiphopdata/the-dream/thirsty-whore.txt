In Time, they'll see, just who you are, 
 Give anything to be a star, 
 No shame, no fame, you love it babe 
 Swallows anything that walks her way 
 Thirsty whore, how you doin'? 
 How is that goin'? Who are you screwing? 
 Where did that get you? A couple of bottles 
 A couple of million, a couple of flowers 
 No turnin' it back, what's on is on 
 Promiscuous, ambiguous 
 Now they turning they back, you've lost it all 
 Sippin' it up till it's all gone 
 You thirsty whore 
 Thirsty whore 
 Thirsty whore 
 Poor girl 
 You need a father figure, put your tiny hands in mine 
 You'll never see it, your love's blind 
 There are times when I thought that you will maybe be okay 
 But no way, no way 
 She came to me desperately screamin' baby give me love 
 And I gave her brick after brick of it, that just wasn't enough 
 She better be moneyed up, she gotta be Louied down 
 She Hollywood forever, they know her all over town 
 Time to see just who you are 
 Do anything to be a star 
 No shame, no fame, love you babe 
 Follow anything that walks her way 
 Thirsty whore, how you doin'? 
 How is that goin'? Who are you screwing? 
 Where did that get you? A couple of bottles 
 A couple of million, a couple of flowers 
 No turnin' it back, what's on is on 
 Promiscuous, ambiguous 
 Now they turning they back, you've lost it all 
 Sippin' it up till it's all gone 
 You thirsty whore 
 Thirsty whore [x5] 
 Oh baby, baby 
 You'll never know what I miss 
 I'm sorry baby 
 I can make you feel what you can't feel 
 Yeah yeah
