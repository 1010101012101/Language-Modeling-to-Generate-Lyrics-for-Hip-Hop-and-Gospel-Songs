No lie 
 I'm a rollin' stone 
 I stay ultra high 
 It's gotten harder to live 
 Easier to die 
 I'm a rollin' stone 
 She said there will never be 
 Love for me 
 But you'll have ever thing 
 But everything 
 Now no fancy car 
 Will replace my love 
 Not even a million women 
 Could help me feel that love 
 I sacrifice everything 
 For this love 
 On a rainy day in 07 
 I found an umbrella 
 Got a taste of it 
 And made a deal with her. 
 For the 
 Holy love, holy love 
 I made a deal with her 
 The holy love holy love 
 I'm a rolling stone 
 There will never be love for me 
 I'll be searching through 
 Forever endlessly 
 I sit amongst the throne 
 Inherited enemies 
 Became royalty 
 In this dynasty 
 Thought that fancy car 
 Would replace my love 
 Took the hands of women 
 To feel that love 
 I sacrificed everything 
 Yet I'm sill prayin' for love 
 I came across another virgo 
 Every one knows 
 Got another taste 
 And re-up my deal with her 
 For the... 
 Holy love, holy love
