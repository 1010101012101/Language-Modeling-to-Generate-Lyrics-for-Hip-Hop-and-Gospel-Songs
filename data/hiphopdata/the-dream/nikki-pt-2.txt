I miss you 
 I miss you 
 Nikki I miss you [x4] 
 It's been 2 whole years 
 One album later 
 Yeah I got your text back 
 Well congratulations 
 Heard you moved to Dallas 
 Hope you're doin' fine 
 Hope yourself even catch you at the wrong time 
 If I say I didn't miss you 
 Girl I would be lying 
 To you I never lie 
 Never would I try 
 And I always thought that you would end up on my side 
 Girl I ain't gon' repeat what I did last time 
 You showin' up, you showin' up, you showin' up where I'm at 
 Keep calling me, keep calling me, keep callin' me, come back 
 You fuckin' with, you fuckin' with, you fuckin' with my life 
 Me and my new girl is cool, but now I'm having doubts... 
 And it's all because of Nikki 
 It's all because of Nikki 
 It's all because of Nikki 
 Shawty we were the greatest 
 In the mix with all the haters 
 Then you twisted all up on me 
 You used to be my homie 
 You said you'd play the role 
 And then you went cold 
 This love we had that was new 
 Suddenly grew old. 
 Girl I thought you had my back 
 Why you treating me like this 
 Can't believe my side chick 
 Running 'round talking shit 
 You said you understood me 
 Wondered what it could be 
 You just say I love you 
 Now I'm screaming fuck you 
 Girl, it's all because of you 
 It's all because of you 
 It's all because of you 
 Even though I said we're through...
