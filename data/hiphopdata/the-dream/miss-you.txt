I miss you like crazy 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home 
 I miss you like crazy 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home 
 Since you've been away 
 Things ain't been the same 
 I miss you more and more each day 
 Something 'bout your love 
 I just can't get enough 
 (Just can't get enough) 
 I wish it wouldn't hurt so much 
 You don't know what you done to me 
 I can't sleep at night, baby 
 Wishin' you were here with me 
 There's something 'bout the love you give 
 No one else could give it to me 
 I miss you like crazy 
 I miss you like crazy 
 I miss you being my baby 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home 
 I miss you like crazy 
 I miss you being my baby 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home 
 No matter what I do 
 I can't stop thinkin' of you 
 You're always on my mind 
 My heart is not a home 
 Since you've been gone 
 (Since you've been gone) 
 I wish you would come back to me 
 You don't know what you done to me 
 I can't sleep at night baby 
 Wishin' you were here with me 
 There's something 'bout the love you give 
 No one else could give it to me 
 I miss you like crazy 
 I miss you like crazy 
 I miss you being my baby 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home 
 (I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know) 
 I miss you like crazy 
 I miss you being my baby 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home 
 (When you're comin' back home) 
 Now I realized how much you meant to me 
 You are my everything 
 I miss you baby 
 I miss you like crazy 
 I miss you being my baby 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home 
 (Home) 
 I miss you like crazy 
 (Yes, I do) 
 I miss you being my baby 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home 
 I miss you like crazy 
 (I miss loving you) 
 I miss you being my baby 
 (I miss hugging you) 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home 
 (There's no one quite like you, baby) 
 I miss you like crazy 
 (Yes, I do) 
 I miss you being my baby 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home 
 (When are you comin' home?) 
 I miss you like crazy 
 (I miss you baby) 
 I miss you being my baby 
 (Yes, I do) 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home 
 I miss you like crazy 
 I miss you being my baby 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home 
 I miss you like crazy 
 I miss you being my baby 
 Tell me when you're comin' back home
