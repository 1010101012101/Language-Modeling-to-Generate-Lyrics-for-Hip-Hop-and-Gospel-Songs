I don't know how to please you 
 Everything was lookin' up but now it's lookin' down 
 And I don't know what I'm supposed to say 
 It seems your mind is on the other side of town 
 And I don't know what I'm supposed to do 
 Another day with you is just another fuckin' day 
 Somebody please tell me what to say 
 Or is it OK to feel this way? 
 'Cause I don't know about us anymore 
 No matter what my mouth may say 
 I don't know about us anymore 
 Laying beside you suddenly feel strange 
 If I say I love you, you're gonna say you love me back 
 But the thing about that is so far from the facts 
 See I don't know about us anymore, 
 No matter what your mouth may say 
 Cause your heart says "long gone" 
 I forgot how to touch you 
 Cause every time I reach, you pull away 
 I've forgotten how to fuck you 
 And now when you say my name it don't feel the same 
 But tell me how I'm supposed to hold you 
 Do you want to fix it or dismiss it? Baby just let me know 
 How am I'm supposed to love you? Girl stop acting like I'm tripping! 
 What y'all looking at? Mind your business! 
 'Cause I don't know about us anymore 
 No matter what my mouth may say 
 I don't know about us anymore 
 Laying beside you suddenly feel strange 
 If I say I love you, you're gonna say you love me back 
 But the thing about that is so far from the facts 
 See I don't know about us anymore, 
 No matter what your mouth may say 
 Cause your heart says "long gone" 
 I used to love you, baby 
 You used to love me, baby 
 Now it's not the same 
 And your heart...
