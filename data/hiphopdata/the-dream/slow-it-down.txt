The-Dream: 
 I know they ain't gon play this on top 40 radio 
 But the white girls still gon' ride it like a rodeo 
 And I'ma stay ridin' this beat like a rodeo 
 And keep throwin' money till shorty gon' touch her toes 
 I'ma keep it real with you baby you bad 
 Kinda like Michael Jackson you bad 
 If you was my girl and left me I be sad 
 And for that let me see that ass 
 The-Dream: 
 I'm here to see that thing pop 
 I'm here to see that thing rock 
 I'm here to see you pick it up and let it drop 
 She backin' it up on me, DJ you know you wrong 
 Enough with the mothafuckin dance songs 
 The-Dream: 
 You gotta slow it down 
 Down down down 
 Down down down 
 So she can take her time and work it on me babe 
 You gotta slow it down 
 Down down down 
 Down down down 
 Whisper in her ear while she on me babe 
 You gotta slow it down down down, 
 Down down down 
 Just swing it left, swing it right 
 You gotta slow it down 
 Down down down 
 Down down down 
 That's what she likes 
 The-Dream: 
 Now she rollin' that and whippin' her hair 
 Slow motion with it while everyone stares 
 You can see her ass from the side of her like 
 Back and forth, forth and back 
 Show me what they do to that 
 Always with ya baby Ill never sell out 
 Them other niggas had to do a dance record 
 All the label wouldn't put 'em out 
 Ill never put a million records before you 
 Just keep on doing that thing you do 
 The-Dream:

 Fabolous: 
 Everybody know slow money way better than no money 
 Except for those who don't know shit 
 Don't know woman don't know money 
 It starts out I'm so cool 
 We hangin' out and I'm so funny 
 All of a sudden I'm Winnie the Pooh 
 All up in your honey 
 Pants on her slim fit 
 Lights in the room dim lit 
 And I'm feelin' on your booty on some R Kelly and Lil Kim shit
