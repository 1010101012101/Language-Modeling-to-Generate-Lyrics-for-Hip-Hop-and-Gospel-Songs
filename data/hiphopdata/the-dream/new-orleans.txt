Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na 
 Oh na na na na na na 
 How can I love this bitch? 
 And at the same time stay and fuck this bitch 
 And at the same time while I fuck this bitch 
 And at the same time had enough of this bitch 
 How can I hold this bitch? 
 And at the same time I don't know this bitch 
 And at the same time I would cry over this bitch 
 And at the same time I would die over this bitch 
 Oh oh 
 On Thursday I'll leave you all alone 
 On Friday you showin up in my songs 
 And Saturday we back on the phone 
 By Sunday... welcome home 
 I think she put that that New Orleans on me (got me feenin) 
 That that New Orleans on me (oh my baby) 
 I think she put that that New Orleans on me (and I can't say shit) 
 That New Orleans on me (just sit back and take it) 
 You know that spaghetti 
 Girl leave me yo dress, say I'll see you when I see you 
 Girl I'll see you 'cause I need ya 
 That that New Orleans on me (it got me feenin) 
 That New Orleans on me (oh my baby) 
 You know, you know 
 How can I curse this bitch? 
 And at the same time I lust over this bitch 
 At the same time while we fuss up in this bitch 
 And we don't match but we perfectly fit 
 How can I trust this bitch? 
 She's so mischiefious 
 But it isn't it obvious? 
 A nigga stuck like chuck up in this bitch 
 But fo real 
 On Thursday I'll leave you all alone 
 On Friday you showin up in my songs 
 By Saturday we back on the phone 
 It's Sunday... welcome home 
 I think she put that that New Orleans on me (got me feenin) 
 That that New Orleans on me (oh my baby) 
 I think she put that that New Orleans on me (and I can't say shit) 
 That New Orleans on me (just sit back and take it) 
 You know that spaghetti 
 Girl leave me yo dress, say I'll see you when I see you 
 Girl I'll see you 'cause I need ya 
 That that New Orleans on me (it got me feenin) 
 That New Orleans on me (oh my baby) 
 You know, you know 
 I wanna let her go and I wanna tell her no 
 But I don't wanna be like that, don't wanna be so bad 
 Don't wanna lay the mat 
 All I know, something's going wrong 
 Still a nigga try to hold on hold on hold on hold on 
 Still can't stay so long 
 But she fine, now she in my face 
 Got a nigga feelin' okay 
 Say she love me then that's where I've been 
 What the fuck you tryna say? 
 Girl, whenever I'm on the side 
 Like she got me high 
 Till she put me down, me down, me down 
 You know what I'm talkin' bout 
 That that New Orleans on me (it got me feenin) 
 That that New Orleans on me (oh my baby)
