If this ain't the realest thing I've ever wrote 
 When I start to sing I pray to God "Make me choke" 
 If this ain't the realest thing I've ever wrote 
 When I start to sing I hope God makes me choke 
 You might wanna say 
 Regardless, he's heartless 
 Caught up, drugged out 
 There I go puttin' words in yo mouth 
 You wanna say, he's a no good, son of a bitch 
 He'll never know what love truly is 
 You wanna say, he ain't never been nothing 
 He's a monster, who would even want him anyway? 
 You wanna say I'm the lowest thing in the world 
 Right next to the snake 
 But what they won't say 
 Is when you need help, who you call? 
 I was there to help you fight 'em all 
 What they won't say is I've slaved for my children 
 Like it's no tomorrow 
 I did it all, even through my sorrow 
 What they won't say 
 Is I've already bought houses for both of my daughters 
 What a wonderful father 
 What they won't say 
 Is I've changed every life of every nigga around me 
 Even the niggas that used to clown me 
 Some days I'm Superman 
 But sometimes even my cape needs dry-cleaning 
 Every once in a while 
 Sometimes I make it through without a pastor 
 But sometimes even I can use some preaching too 
 I'm just a child 
 Some days I'm full of positive energy 
 Other days I'm tired and I need help 
 Just to smile 
 Most days I can lead us to victory 
 But some days I need you to lead me 
 I can hear my mother say from the other land 
 This too shall pass 
 I can hear my father say from the other land 
 This too shall pass 
 Hate me when I'm up, love me when I'm down 
 Appreciate the good and bad until I'm underground 
 Love when me I'm torn, love me when I fall 
 Crucify me if you want but I won't stop loving 
 Y'all y'all y'all y'all 
 Y'all y'all y'all y'all 
 Y'all y'all y'all y'all 
 Y'all y'all y'all y'all 
 What they wanna say 
 Is how I don't give a damn about anybody 
 Who the fuck you kidding? Yeah right 
 They wanna say 
 I'm selfish, I wasn't there when you was helpless 
 Yeah, whatever, whatever 
 They wanna say 
 That I'm trash, I'm broken glass 
 I'm all that 
 But what they they they they they won't say 
 Is that he's fair, and that he's always there 
 At the same motherfuckin' time 
 He said he was gon' be there 
 What they won't say 
 Is that I take love seriously 
 What they won't say 
 Is that I care like you wouldn't believe 
 So if I hurt you I'm sorry 
 I didn't mean no harm 
 But I really gave it my all 
 Some days I'm Superman 
 But sometimes even my cape needs dry-cleaning 
 Every once in a while 
 Sometimes I make it through without a pastor 
 But sometimes even I can use some preaching too 
 I'm just a child 
 Some days I'm full of positive energy 
 Other days I'm tired and I need help 
 Just to smile 
 Most days I can lead us to victory 
 But some days I need you to lead me 
 I can hear my mother say from the other land 
 This too shall pass 
 I can hear my father say from the other land 
 This too shall pass 
 Hate me when I'm up, love me when I'm down 
 Appreciate the good and bad until I'm underground 
 Love when I'm torn, love me when I fall 
 Crucify me if you want but I won't stop loving you 
 Y'all y'all y'all y'all 
 Y'all y'all y'all y'all 
 Y'all y'all y'all y'all 
 Y'all y'all y'all y'all 
 If this ain't the realest thing I've ever wrote 
 When I start to sing I pray to God "Make me choke" 
 If this ain't the realest thing I've ever wrote 
 When I start to sing I hope God makes me choke 
 I'm only human 
 And you're only human
