Girl I'm in love with you baby. 
 And I want you to know. 
 That I'm hooked on your body. 
 And I'm trying to be your's. 
 (Radio killa, killa, killa) 
 (Oh yessir, yessir) 
 We've hit it up like a realler? 
 (Check, where you at? Oh yessir) 
 She goin' right, she goin' left 
 I had her here, myself 
 I got on it, like I want it 
 She rode the beat like a pony 
 Cameras up, cameras flash 
 I'm tipsy, tryna last 
 I wanna change your name to Mrs. Nash 
 There's nothing left to say 
 She rockin' that shit like 
 She rockin' that shit like 
 There's nothing I can say 
 She rockin' that shit like 
 She rockin' that shit like 
 There's nothing I can say 
 She's just rockin' that shit like 
 We out the door, we in the car 
 She under my shirt, I'm under her bra 
 She said take it if you want it 
 Then we make love till the first sight of morning 
 So we did it, done it, get it, got it 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh baby 
 She said do it till her body don't move baby 
 Ooh Baby 
 Girl I'm in love with you baby 
 And I want you to know 
 That I'm hooked on your body 
 And I'm trying to be your's 
 Hear my words for their worth 
 Ain't just tryna get in your clothes 
 Okay, I'm lying. Damn you fine 
 And uhm... 
 Take me, I'm your's shawty 
 As we rock to the left, rock to the right 
 Lend me your body, I'ma rock it all night 
 Don't leave us on this floor shawty 
 The door's to the left, I'm parked on the right 
 Tell my niggas holla back 
 Tell your girls goodnight 
 The way you rockin' that up in this club 
 I swear you gon' make a nigga fall in love 
 The way you rockin' that up in this club 
 I swear you gon' make a nigga fall in love, love
