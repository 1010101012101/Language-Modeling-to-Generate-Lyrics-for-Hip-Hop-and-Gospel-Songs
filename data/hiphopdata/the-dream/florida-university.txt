Used to Love ya (shawty), 
 You used to love me (shawty), 
 And then you left (shawty), 
 Quit thinkin' of me (shawty), 
 You want me back (shawty) 
 I can't do that (shawty), 
 Get some Patron (shawty), 
 This night gon' be long (shawty), 
 I picked you up, 
 Never put you down, 
 We were good together, 
 We looked so hood together, 
 And now you hate me, 
 Lately, 
 What rhyme wit ass hole, 
 Ass hole! 
 I was the realest thing you've ever known, 
 I couldn't wait to say I told you so. 
 So forget you ever heard of me,

 Acting crazy, you all crunk 
 Still got them pictures you sent me when you were drunk, 
 Its heart break, I know but calm down. 
 An why you still cursing me out on your Twitter account? 
 And why you trippin' fo'? 
 Don't you got a man? 
 You a little off, I hope he understands 
 "I'm sorry we can work it out" 
 "I'm sorry, you aren't in my plan" 
 Then again, guess what finger I'm holding up on my hand 
 I was the realest thing you've ever known, 
 I couldn't wait to say I told you so. 
 So forget you ever heard of me, 
 This is short for Florida University, (Oh yeah)

 I hope this song is cutting like glass, girl 
 This ain't a compliment, you was a bad girl 
 You tried to break my heart but it backfired, 
 I'm rolling on them 24's you flattire 
 I was the realest thing you've ever known, 
 I couldn't wait to say I told you so. 
 So forget you ever heard of me, 
 This is short for Flo- Uni- Versity!, (Oh yeah)
