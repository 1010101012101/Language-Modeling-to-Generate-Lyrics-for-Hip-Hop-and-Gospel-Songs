Shawty, rock to the beat for your boy 
 Shawty, do it 
 Rock to the beat for your boy 
 Radio killa, killa, killa 
 Shawty fine, shawty tight 
 Should've stayed there all night with you, with you 
 I missed ya picture 
 Now it's time I get back up with you, girl, with you 
 Oh yeah, we used to kick it up at the park 
 But now she's all grown up 
 Rockin' them stilettos 
 Jumpin' up out of that Mercedes truck 
 It was Kisha, it was Sonya 
 It was Tonya, it was Monique 
 It was Niece, it was Kiki 
 Now to see you at 23 all I can say is 
 Man, I don't need no hook for this hit 
 'Cause shawty right there is a ten, eh, a ten, eh 
 Shawty you a ten, eh, a ten, eh 
 Shawty you a ten, eh, a ten, eh 
 Shawty you a ten, eh, a ten, oh yeah, eh 
 Dior jeans, a walk so mean 
 Burberry fragrance on my shirt from when she hugged me 
 Hard as a rock when she touched me 
 Thinkin' now 'cause she would've loved me 
 What it is, what it ain't, tell me what to do 
 I know I'm late but destiny brought me back to you 
 Time went by, turned you into a butterfly 
 I'm here to say hello, tell your ***** goodbye 
 It was Kisha, it was Sonya 
 It was Tonya, it was Monique 
 It was Niece, it was Kiki 
 Now that I see you at 23 all I can say is 
 Man, I don't need no hook for this hit 
 'Cause shawty right there is a ten, eh, a ten, eh 
 Shawty you a ten, eh, a ten, eh 
 Shawty you a ten, eh, a ten, eh 
 Shawty you a ten, eh, a ten, oh yeah, eh 
 If she fine, if shawty a dime 
 You should tip her, you should tip her 
 If she you girl and you love her 
 You should tip her, you should tip her 
 If she fix you eggs and grits in the morning 
 Man, you should tip her, you should tip her 
 Pancakes with the bacon on the side 
 You should tip me, you should tip me 
 Shawty, rock to the beat for your boy 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Rock to the beat for your boy 
 Now that I see you at 23 all I can say is 
 Man, I don't need no hook for this hit 
 'Cause shawty right there is a ten, eh, a ten, eh 
 Shawty you a ten, eh, a ten, eh 
 Shawty you a ten, eh, a ten, eh 
 Shawty you a ten, eh, a ten, oh yeah, eh
