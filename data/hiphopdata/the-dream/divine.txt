You're so beautiful 
 Backseat driving, wonderful islands 
 Oh yeah yeah 
 Beautiful morning sky 
 Coffee and New York Times 
 Oh yeah 
 I can change my mind mid-air 
 And we flyin anywhere 
 Oh yeah 
 Girl red light, life is so divine 
 Oh yeah 
 So divine 
 So divine 
 So divine 
 So divine 
 Pa ra ra pa pa ra ra 
 Pa ra ra ra ta ta ra ra 
 Rolex movements 
 I'm never excluded, 
 Oh yeah 
 Time with kings, 
 Desert amongst queens 
 Oh yeah 
 Weeks on yachts 
 Almost forgot 
 Oh yeah 
 The time will tell 
 Is it March or May? 
 As the seats recline 
 This is divine 
 Oh yeah 
 So divine 
 So divine 
 So divine 
 So divine 
 (This is so divine) 
 Pa ra ra pa pa ra ra 
 Pa ra ra ra ta ta ra ra 
 Pa ra ra pa pa ra ra 
 Pa ra ra ra ta ta ra ra 
 As I define, define 
 Living in this never-ending sky 
 A devotion to these secret ways of mine 
 Burning lights all day and all night 
 Return me to my roamin' days 
 Where the riches play 
 Wait, I know this place 
 I've been here before 
 Living in the zema 
 And all 
 And the only thing I feel 
 Is infinity 
 Divine
