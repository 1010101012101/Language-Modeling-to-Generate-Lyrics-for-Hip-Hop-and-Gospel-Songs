 Fabolous: 
 Hey its loso incase you ain't know so ay dream 
 Let me tell you about shorty 
 Shorty is the shh shh shh suga honey 
 Ice-t prettiest one I see lil mama 
 Icy they say she a piece 
 I heard they are fisty 
 U know how to 
 Treat her she'll be sweeter den a hi-c 
 Clean her very nicely 
 Shoes are kinna pricy 
 Match 'em up percisly good jeans nice 
 Tee like her food spicy 
 And she is tha same 
 Hotter then a flame but I do not no her 
 Name is it keisha?, is it tiesha?, 
 Maybe lisa, or taurissa, 
 It could be tia, maybe aaliyah, 
 I guess I'll find out one day before that

 Shoulda stayed there all night 
 With you (you) with you

 Now its time i 
 Get back up with you (you) girl with you 
 Oh yeah

 Now she's all growwn up (up) 
 Rockin' them stilettos 
 Jumpin' up outta that mercedes truck (truck)

 'Cause shawty right there is a ten, a ten, a ten 
 Shawty right there is a ten

 Need your keys 
 So waltz on me 
 Burberry fragance on my shirt from when she 
 (Oh) me 
 Hard as a rock from when she touched me 
 Thinkin' now that she would've loved me 
 What it is, what it ain't, tell me what to do 
 I know I'm late but destiny brought me back to you 
 Time went byturned you into a butterfly 
 So I say hello, tell yo nigga goodbye 
 It was kiesha

 You should tip her, you should tip her 
 If she go, and you love her 
 You should tip her, you should tip her 
 If she fix you eggs and grits in the morning 
 You should tip her, you should tip her 
 Pancakes with the bacon on the side
