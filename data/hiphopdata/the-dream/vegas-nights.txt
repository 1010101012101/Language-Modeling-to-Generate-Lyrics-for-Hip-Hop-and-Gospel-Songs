Lift off, take flight 
 I'm living the life 
 Racing down the boulevard 
 Under the Vegas lights 
 Uh, oh, oh, 
 What a wonderful feeling 
 To get my hands up to the ceiling, 
 Singing, uh, oh, oh 
 Got my hands up in the air 
 Where we end up I don't care 
 Just let me get a little Michael, tonight 
 Get a little Gladys, yeah, alright 
 Get a little Lionel Richie, Marvin Gaye 
 And some of that every right 
 Some of that Otis that we like, 
 Some of that Sam show you right 
 Even Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack, 
 James Brown probably all night 
 Oh yeah, Vegas nights, Vegas nights 
 Oh yeah, Vegas nights, Vegas nights 
 I really don't know what I would do without you, baby 
 You flip the switch and I'm on, all night long 
 And you now I can't sleep without you, baby 
 Even in a city with lights, I still can't see, 
 But I feel 20-20 when you're with me 
 Hope you love me too 
 You're my everything 
 I wanna be yours forever, 
 Baby not just not like me. 
 There's this former love that stays, never goes, 
 I'm gonna gather your light 
 And then shoot, baby, right 
 Just let me get a little Michael, tonight 
 Get a little Gladys, yeah, alright! 
 Get a little Lionel Richie, Marvin Gaye 
 And some of that very right 
 Some of that Otis that we like, 
 Some of that Sam show you right 
 Even Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack, 
 James Brown probably all night 
 Oh yeah, Vegas nights, 
 Gimmie that, gimmie that Vegas nights 
 Oh yeah, Vegas nights, 
 Gimmie that, gimmie that Vegas nights 
 I'm out for tonight 
 Well, keep it going until the sun comes up! 
 We gonna say, and we gonna dance 
 Shut it down to life! 
 Just let me get a little Michael, tonight 
 Get a little Gladys, yeah, alright! 
 Get a little Lionel Richie, Marvin Gaye 
 And some of that very right 
 Some of that Otis that we like, 
 Some of that Sam show you right 
 Even Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack, 
 James Brown probably all night 
 Oh yeah, Vegas nights, 
 Gimmie that, gimmie that Vegas nights 
 Oh yeah, Vegas nights, 
 Gimmie that, gimmie that Vegas nights
