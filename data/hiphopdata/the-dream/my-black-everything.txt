(Chopped and Screwed voice): 
 Black everything, black, black everything 
 (In the background) 
 Love ya babe, I just wanna love ya babe 
 Let me love ya babe, I just wanna love ya babe [x2] 
 Get up in this bed 
 Come up out them clothes 
 Black Fendi curtains 
 Black marble on the floor 
 Baby let me watch it 
 Give me a show 
 Black lingerie (uh) 
 Shawty get it on 
 Now come up out that black... hoody 
 Out them black... designer jeans 
 Out them black... shades 
 Come get it babe, come get it babe 
 Come up out my black... Jesus piece 
 My black... Audemars 
 It's black... everywhere we are 
 And you're the star (?) 
 (In the background) 
 Not just the car, but everywhere we are (x2) 
 You know I miss it 
 Girl you know I love it 
 Know I want to kiss it 
 I can't wait to hug it 
 Do you on to me on 
 Black suede, black fur 
 Lose you in the back seat 
 Black diamonds, black purse 
 And we so hood 
 Certified rock stars 
 Keep it looking good 
 Put it on my black card 
 And put a rub in the black style (?) and 
 Sweat the eyeliner out 
 Apply it again 
 Can't wait to get that black skirt up in my crib 
 Can't wait to get you out them... heels 
 Ace of Spades sipping 
 This is how we live 
 Yeah 
 Jet black hair 
 Falling down her back 
 All up on her Baby Phat like trains on a track 
 Imma hit it like crack 
 I'm feenin 
 She on the black roller coaster 
 Straight screaming 
 Lip singing on my microphone 
 Still got my fitted on 
 Sidenote 
 You should download this as your ringtone 
 Back to the black linen 
 H-h-h hell naw 
 Shawty I ain't finished 
 Y-y-y yell y'all 
 Riding it like a black Ducati 
 Baby 
 She in my ear like boy you got me 
 Baby 
 We Ace of Spades sipping 
 This is how we live 
 Yeah 
 Not just the car, but everywhere we are
