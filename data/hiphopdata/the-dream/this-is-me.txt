This is me 
 This is me 
 This is me 
 She stole your heart 
 Only did it because she could 
 Chewed you up and swapped you around 
 That girl never was no good 
 Baby, I will never do that 
 I'll love you faithfully 
 But your suspicious mind thinks 
 I'm gonna repeat her story 
 She's making you crazy, making you a wreck 
 Making you follow me, making me a suspect 
 You seem to think I'm playing her game 
 Don't you know her name 
 That was her, this is me 
 We're as different as can be 
 She and I are nothing alike 
 You confusing day with night 
 That was then, this is now 
 You wanna trust me but you don't know how 
 I'm never gonna mess around, set you down, can't you see 
 That was her and baby this is me 
 Stop making me feel bad 
 I'm the best thing you ever had 
 The only thing I'm guilty of 
 Is giving you too much love 
 She's making you crazy, making you a wreck 
 Making you follow me, making me a suspect 
 You seem to think I'm playing her game 
 Don't you know, don't you know my name 
 That was her, this is me 
 We're as different as can be 
 She and I are nothing alike 
 You confusing day with night 
 That was then, this is now 
 You wanna trust me but you don't know how 
 I'm never gonna mess around, set you down, can't you see 
 That was her and baby this is me 
 Don't suffocate me, give me some space 
 Don't make me pay for all her mistakes 
 Believe in the love that's in my kiss 
 Don't say things that don't exist 
 That was her, this is me 
 We're as different as can be 
 She and I are nothing alike 
 You confusing day with night 
 That was then, this is now 
 You wanna trust me but you don't know how 
 I'm never gonna mess around, set you down, can't you see 
 That was her and baby this is me 
 That was her, this is me 
 We're as different as can be 
 She and I are nothing alike 
 You confusing day with night 
 That was then, this is now 
 You wanna trust me but you don't know how 
 I'm never gonna mess around, set you down, can't you see 
 That was her and baby this is me
