(Verse 1: The-Dream) 
 Hoop Earrings 
 She's my favorite baby 
 Watch her do her thing 
 Out here in the world 
 Nobody calling me 
 Like AT&T 
 Hater-proof 
 They ain't got nothin' on you 
 So fine, so hot, so cold (yeah) 
 Beautiful, so bold, for sure (yeah, yeah) 
 Pretty little thing, I'm glad she's mine 
 And I mean no disrespect by this next line 
 (I gotta) dope bitch 
 (I gotta) a dope bitch 
 (I gotta) dope bitch 
 (I gotta) a-a dope bitch 
 (Verse 2: The-Dream) 
 Number 3's 
 She ain't in heels 
 She walkin' round here 
 Dope like me 
 Cocaine persona, marijuana 
 Wish you would like trees 
 Sold on her like kees (kilos) 
 Feelin' all on her like keys 
 So it seems 
 (It's whatever you want) 
 You got it baby 
 The dopest thing I've seen 
 I'm hooked on you like d.o.p.e. 
 Like d.o.p.e. 
 So fine, so hot, so cold (yeah, yeah) 
 Beautiful, so bold, for sure (yeah, yeah) 
 Pretty little thing, I'm glad she's mine 
 And I mean no disrespect by this next line 
 (I gotta) dope bitch 
 (I gotta) a dope bitch 
 (I gotta) dope bitch 
 (I gotta) a-a dope bitch 
 So fine, so hot, so cold (yeah, yeah) 
 Beautiful, so bold, for sure (yeah, yeah) 
 Pretty little thing, I'm glad she's mine 
 And I mean no disrespect by this next line 
 (Verse 3: Pusha T) 
 She dope like the shit up in my car 
 Feds came and she put it in her bra 
 So I sponsor Isabel Marants 
 It's the gram and everything she flaunts 
 Knows when to cut up 
 Know when to shut the fuck up 
 Know when to smile 
 And knows when to act stuck up 
 She like to talk who got it who gettin' it 
 Which nigga all talk and who spendin' it 
 She only like sports if she court side 
 And hoppin' out the Panamera Porsche ride 
 She the bonnie to my clyde 
 The perfect somebody on the side 
 My dope bitch 
 (I gotta) dope bitch 
 (I gotta) a dope bitch 
 (I gotta) dope bitch 
 (I gotta) a-a dope bitch 
 Dope bitch, my dope bitch 
 A dope bitch, a dope bitch, 
 Dope bitch, a my dope bitch 
 Dope bitch, a my dope bitch, 
 Dope bitch, a my dope bitch 
 Dope bitch, a my dope bitch, 
 Dope bitch, a my dope bitch 
 I'm glad she's mine
