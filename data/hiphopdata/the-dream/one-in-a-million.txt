Love it babe (repeat 12 times in groups of 3) 
 (1st verse) 
 Baby you don't know 
 What you done to me 
 Between me and you I feel a chemistry. 
 I won't let no one come and take your place 
 Cause the love you give it can't be replaced. 
 See No one else loves me like you do 
 That's why I don't mind to 
 Spend my life with you 
 I Wanna please you in any way I can 
 I Wanna share my world and don't you understand. 
 Your love is a one in a million 
 It goes on and on and on 
 You give me a really good feelin' all day long 
 Your love is one in a million 
 You give me a really good feelin' all day long 
 (2nd verse) 
 Turn me inside out, 
 Make my heart speak 
 Need no one else you're all I need 
 Personality (ty), and everything you do (do) 
 Makes me love everything 'bout you. 
 Your smile, 
 Your style, so fly, I can't deny.IGotta crush on you and that is true indeed 
 Now I'm diggin' you, you makin' me believe. 
 (Bridge Repeat 2x) 
 I'll give you anything you want from me 
 Anything you want, 
 Anything you need, 
 Anything your soul desires. 
 Love it babe (until fade)
