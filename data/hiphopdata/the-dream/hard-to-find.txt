Who you know put them grits with them eggs 
 With the bacon on the side (oh, oh) 
 Who you know wash your clothes 
 And put ehm back in the dresser like I (oh, oh) 
 And who you know got your back like I do 
 And who you know put it on ya like I do, 
 Who you know get up early in the morning 
 Just to make sure you on time, for your flight 
 Now your saying that you wanna leave me 
 After all the things we went through 
 Just remember one thing 
 While your leaving 
 They don't make ehm like me (cause you know) 
 But a girl like me is hard to find 
 Hard to find, hard to find (yeah) 
 But a girl like me is hard to find 
 Hard to find, hard to find 
 So go ahead and waste your time 
 With them other girls 
 Just know that they got nothing on me 
 But a girl like me is hard to find 
 Hard to find, hard to find 
 Who you know get the wrinkles 
 Out cha button up shirt like me (oh, oh) 
 And who know clean your house after 
 Monday night football like me (x4) 
 Who you know gon love you more than I do 
 (Oh, oh) 
 Who you know protect you like I do 
 Who you know stay with you 
 Through thick and thin you were 
 My homie, my lover 
 You were my bestfriend 
 Now your saying that you wanna leave me 
 After all the things we went through 
 Just remember one thing while your leaving 
 They don't make ehm like me (cause you know)
