Shawty need my love sh sh shawty need my love dog 
 (Repeat) 
 You seen her walkin' through 
 Hearts fill in the national 
 On her way too see me 
 She's far from the girl that you used too know 
 Flawsin' keys to your phantom and you know that she's my girl 
 Still you try to get at her 
 But she push the brakes on that shit like skeerrww 
 And I don't blame you cause god the girl look good 
 She said she couldn't even if she could. 
 She needs my love 
 She said I'm like the air and without me she'll die 
 If it ain't my love 
 You better have a doctor on standby 
 She needs my love 
 She said I'm like the air and without me she'll die 
 If it ain't my love 
 You better have a doctor on standby 
 (Repeat 4x) 
 Shawty need my love sh sh shawty need my love dog 
 You seen us walkin' through the club 
 Little fendi skirt lettin' them panties show oh 
 She grindin' on me (meee) 
 I see you tryin' too flirt with her on the low 
 Flawsin' keys too your rover boy you know that that's my girl 
 I left and you made your way over 
 But she push the brakes on that shit like skeerrww 
 And I can't blame you cause goddamm the girl is fine 
 She said she can't beacause she's mine mine mine 
 She needs my love 
 She said I'm like the air and without me she'll die 
 If it ain't my love 
 You better have a doctor on standby 
 She needs my love 
 She said I'm like the air and without me she'll die 
 If it ain't my love 
 You better have a doctor on standby 
 (Repeat 4x) 
 Shawty need my love sh sh shawty need my love dog 
 Yessir 
 From the look of my wardrobe I can see why you mad though 
 See me up in bankhead chillin' with a bad hoe 
 Tell Oprah I'm sorry I really meant to say bad though 
 She keep them thongs ch ch ch chewin' on her asshole 
 I'm all up on her ass though runnin' it like a cash flow 
 I'm still hood even though my bank account upper class hoe 
 We 3 minutes in too the song but still nigga you mad though 
 But nah he skwitchin' from my wrist cause my wrist got the mad glow 
 She needs my love 
 She said I'm like the air and without me she'll die 
 If it ain't my love 
 You better have a doctor on standby 
 She needs my love 
 She said I'm like the air and without me she'll die 
 If it ain't my love 
 You better have a doctor on standby 
 You better, you better 
 Call 9-1-1 if my love ain't there 
 Call 9-1-1 tell paramedics to bring her air 
 She needs my love you 
 Better have a doctor on standby
