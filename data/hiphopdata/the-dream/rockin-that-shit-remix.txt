 Girl I'm in love with you baby. 
 And I want you to know. 
 That I'm hooked on your body. 
 And I'm trying to be your's...

 Now she the definition of fine 
 But I told her that her body looks better with mine [x2] 
 (Fabolous) 
 I like the way she rock, her hips 
 Them rockin' hips 
 Told her we can take off like rocket ships 
 Straight jacket jeans, you look crazy in 'em 
 The way you rockin' that, I thought they was Jay-Z denim 
 Let me drop a jewel on ya, put a roc in air 
 Can I call you nana 'cause you got that rockin' chair 
 It go back, and forth - then forth and back 
 When I'm on Patron, or off the yak 
 Can't get off the fact I'm off my Mac 
 Goldie probably wouldn't, but I would trick off a that 
 And I'm sick with the money, I can cough a stack 
 I can sneeze some g's so baby let's roll...

 She rockin' that shit like 
 The way you rockin' that up in this club. 
 I swear you gon' make a nigga fall in love 
 She rockin' that shit like 
 The way you rockin' that up in this club 
 There's nothing I can say 
 She rockin' that shit like 
 The way you rockin' that up in this club

 (Juelz Santana) 
 Whoa, whoa 
 Look how shawty roll, roll 
 She rockin' that shit 
 I'm like look at shawty go, go 
 She rockin' to the beat, she rockin' it for me 
 And all I can think about is rockin' it to sleep 
 Her face is like a model 
 Body shape just like a bottle 
 Girl I wanna hit that more than I wanna hit the lotto 
 She revvin' me up, I got my hand all on my throttle 
 I wanna get on top of her, zoom on the Yamaha 
 So you can call it switchin' gears 
 Zoom in inside of her 
 And if it taste how it look I'ma try to swallow her 
 Call me Mr. Shoe-shine, baby I'ma polish ya 
 And I leave ya spit clean, I don't use no polisher 
 Demolition man, tell your friends I demolish ya 
 Plus I'm that nigga, baby I could make you popular 
 So get another shot of that Ciroc in ya 
 'Cause I'm gon' be rockin' ya 
 Treat you like the first lady 
 I'll put my Barack in ya...

 (Rick Ross) 
 Fresh lack President, one 
 Air force ones in my Air Force One (Obama) 
 Is it all a dream? (No) Sorry, my reality 
 See me rocking that shit is complementing my salary 
 Complementary balance, told 'em what we tally 
 Spinning like it's ballet and I touched the budget ballot (Boss) 
 See the girl, and holla (Ey) 
 Told me that she from the (A) 
 So you know I had to (ey) classify my case...

 Now let me take you to a place far beyond 
 In a whole 'nother galaxy 
 Travel in your mind, explore your sexuality 
 Melt your imagination and mold it into reality 
 Your heart's my art gallery, girl 
 Can you feel the pictures that I painted 
 'Cause all of them are related, like a mother to a son 
 But none of them overrated 
 There no others, you the one 
 Our destiny is to make it 
 Gotta thank you just for sharing your world 
 It's so real, an inspiration for no reason 
 But thinking that I'm incapable of taking on the duty of making you interchangeable 
 The thought is sensational, its perfect bliss 
 I'm ready to take the milky way to your Hershey's kiss 
 You know my tongue's got batteries in it 
 The bedroom, we lose calories in it and start families in it 
 And don't worry 'cause the situation's under control 
 So let me dive in your heart and swim around in your soul (Luda).. 
 (The-Dream) 
 Take me I'm yours, shawty 
 As we rock to the left, rock to the right 
 Lend me your body and we'll rock it all night 
 Don't leave us on this floor, shawty 
 The door's to the left, I parked on the right 
 Tell the niggas holla back, tell your girls goodnight... 
 The way you rockin' that up in this club. 
 I swear you gon' make a nigga fall in love 
 The way you rockin' that up in this club 
 I swear you gon' make a nigga fall in love, love...
