Yo Yo Yo 
 That's my girl right? 
 This ain't my girl, this my nigga 
 Ooh Ooh 
 That's my nigga right there (that's my nigga right there) 
 That's my nigga right there (that's my nigga right there) 
 That's my nigga right there (that's my nigga right there) 
 Before the sex pop off she rub my back, rub my back (shawty rub my back) 
 She never gone for long she be right back, be right back (shawty be right back) 
 And she keep a bag full of goodies 
 Her love's baked up like pillsbury cookies (ooh Yeah) 
 It ain't about the Benz or the Money 
 She's my bee, I'm her honey 
 Man that's my homie 
 And she got me playin' in her hair 
 And I fell like an outwork boxer in the very first round 
 Got me playin' in her hair 
 Tried to keep my guard up, but she caught me and I'm goin' down 
 Got me playin' in her hair, eh, hair, eh, hair, eh 
 Playin' in her hair, eh, hair, eh, hair, eh 
 Playin' in her hair, eh, hair, eh, hair, eh 
 Playin' in her hair, eh, hair, eh, hair, eh 
 Got me playin' in her hair, eh, hair, eh, hair, eh 
 Playin' in her hair, eh, hair, eh, hair, eh 
 Playin' in her hair, eh, hair, eh, hair, eh 
 Playin' in her hair, eh, hair, eh, hair, eh 
 See I love this girl, She's all I need 
 And right now anything she want she can get it from me, me, me 
 And she do her thang, when I come around 
 And even when I'm not (not) up in the spot shawty hold me down, down, down 
 Before the sex pop off she rub my back, rub my back (shawty rub my back) 
 She never gone for long she be right back, be right back (shawty be right back) 
 And she keep a bag full of goodies 
 Her love's baked up like pillsbury cookies (ooh Yeah) 
 It ain't about the Benz or the Money 
 She's my bee, I'm her honey 
 Man that's my homie 
 And she got me playin' in her 
 And I fell like an outwork boxer in the very first round 
 Got me playin' in her hair 
 Tried to keep my guard up, but she caught me and I'm goin' down 
 Got me playin' in her hair, eh, hair, eh, hair, eh 
 Playin' in her hair, eh, hair, eh, hair, eh 
 Playin' in her hair, eh, hair, eh, hair, eh
