Ooh 
 The name of money 
 Uu yeah, yeah yeah... 
 Yeah... a a yeah... 
 You, (you you you) 
 You can't say that I really didn't love ya... (ah) 
 There's a new new new new new Louis bag every time that I touched you 
 Quit acting like I'm the only one to blame honey 
 Didn't hear you scream when you was tricking off my money 
 But you left me here to clean up your dirty laundry 
 Oh yeah... 
 So kiss that nigga 
 Hug that nigga 
 Love that nigga to death 
 Go ahead and please that nigga 
 Beat that nigga 
 In time you'll see the problems yourself 
 'Cause when love is your problem 
 Nothing can solve it, 
 When love is the problem 
 Money can't solve it 
 When love is your problem 
 Nothing can solve it 
 When love is your problem 
 No man can solve it 
 Love is your problem 
 Now you you you 
 Can look back at all the shit you've done 
 To her loves the jail, so she stays on the run 
 You give her money, she want love 
 You give her love, she's back at money 
 Shell run from man to man 
 Making plans to plan, 
 No secret y'all know who we talking bout 
 'Cause when love is your problem 
 Nothing can solve it, 
 When love is the problem (there ain't nothing) 
 Money can't solve it 
 When love is your problem 
 Nothing can solve it 
 When love is the problem 
 No man can solve it 
 Nothing can solve it 
 Solve it 
 Solve it 
 Solve it 
 Oh ooh 
 I wonder if you will ever take the responsibility of what you've already done 
 By the time you'll figure out that she's not the one, 3 years that went by, nigga you done 
 You're done 
 You're done 
 You're done 
 Nigga you done 
 You're done 
 You're done... 
 If you get her back... [fade...]
