I'm sorry I can't meet your approval 
 So please keep the hand claps 
 No need for a compliment 
 I can pat myself on the back 
 No dying for an award 
 You can keep the trophy 
 I could really care less 
 Whether any of y'all motherfuckers know me 
 Excuse my French, pardon me 
 I don't mean to steal your shine 
 Man I'll be in this sun for so long 
 Lookin' my way will just make you blind 
 All I need is the love 
 'Cause I can never have enough of that 
 You don't have to try to be the man 
 When you the man 
 See I'm embedded 
 And your fifteen minutes are almost up 
 Socialite 
 I wish you would roll up 
 Don't try me I'm not like him 
 Not like them 
 I wish you would roll up 
 I'm not him I'm not like them 
 Don't try me 
 I'm not better than that 
 Form of flattery 
 You say he sound like me 
 You say they sound like me 
 I don't need another whip 
 A nigga flyin' now 
 I see you in the shadow 
 In motion without a paddle 
 Stop acting like a girlfriend 
 Stop acting like a freshman 
 If you're surprised you're here 
 It means you shouldn't be here 
 No heart no glory 
 No pain no fear 
 It's one thing to be hot 
 But that don't make it a career 
 I'm embedded 
 And your fifteen minutes are almost up 
 I wish you would roll up 
 Don't try me I'm not like him 
 Not like them 
 I wish you would roll up 
 I'm not him I'm not like them 
 Don't try me 
 I'm not better than that 
 But I appreciate the form of flattery 
 Appreciate the form of flattery
