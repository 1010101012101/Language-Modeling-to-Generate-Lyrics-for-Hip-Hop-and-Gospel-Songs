Line ringing: 
 "Record your message after the tone." 
 Beep: 
 The Dream spoken: 
 Yo come pick up, I'm a get you soon as I leave the studio. 
 Ah, Ah, Ah, Rihanna, 
 E, e, 
 Dreamer, 
 Aw, Aw, 
 E, e, e. 
 I wanna tell the world that you're my girl and that I'm your man, ah baby, 
 And I wanna tell the world that you got me, why can't we be, ah baby, 
 I can't put my name on your kiss, 
 And I can't speak your name from these lips, 
 We froze, 
 And nobody knows, 
 Have to walk out the room every time you call, 
 Tellin' everybody I ain't seen you in so long, 
 It feels like I ain't breatin', 
 This feels worser than cheatin'. 
 'Cause we out here livin' a lie, 
 Out here livin' a lie, 
 I'm out here livin' a lie, 
 Why what makes you smile seem to make you cry, 
 I'm out here livin' a lie, 
 I'm out here livin' a lie, 
 We out here livin' a lie, 
 Behind these smiles I'm really hurtin', 
 Inside-side-side, 
 Inside-side-side, 
 Inside-side-side, 
 Inside-side-side. 
 Everytime I wanna put us on display time takes a breathe, ah Baby 
 I hear about other relationships that ain't true, I wanna set it right, ah Baby 
 And I can't tell nobody how I feel, ooh, 
 And I can't tell nobody how we is, ooh, 
 I wanna hop on the first thing smokin', 
 Tell our agent to book us a plane, 
 I wanna be near you, 
 I wanna be near you, too, 
 I wanna wake up, wake up, 
 Right next to you baby. 
 'Cause we out here livin' a lie, 
 Out here livin' a lie, 
 I'm out here livin' a lie, 
 Why what makes you smile seem to make you cry, 
 I'm out here livin' a lie, 
 I'm out here livin' a lie, 
 We out here livin' a lie, 
 Behind these smiles I'm really hurtin', 
 Inside-side-side, 
 Inside-side-side, 
 Inside-side-side, 
 Inside-side-side. 
 Rihanna baby, 
 Dream baby, 
 What on this earth will we do? 
 Assume that I'm not a su-ume, 
 And everythin' in this world has got us crazy, 
 I'm so through, 
 You too? 
 We alone, 
 What the worst that could happen baby if they know? 
 Won't be nothin', 
 'Cause you're inpecable, your everything that I love. 
 'Cause we out here livin' a lie, 
 Out here livin' a lie, 
 I'm out here livin' a lie, 
 Why what makes you smile seem to make you cry, 
 I'm out here livin' a lie, 
 I'm out here livin' a lie, 
 We out here livin' a lie, 
 Behind these smiles I'm really hurtin', 
 Inside-side-side, 
 Inside-side-side, 
 Inside-side-side, 
 Inside-side-side. 
 I wanna be with you.
