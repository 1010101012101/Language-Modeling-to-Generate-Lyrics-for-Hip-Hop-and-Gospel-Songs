Started out talkin' right here 
 Puttin' it down like a mu-fu**ing mack 
 Sellin? candy all up in my ear 
 She wanna be down like the D's on the ?Lac 
 Slow dancin? in the club 
 Her diamonds look like rainbows 
 She grindin? on my di** 
 She lookin' for the pot of gold 
 We hop up in that AMG and D we in the Westin 
 She puttin' moves on me 
 I could?a swore shawty's a wrestler 
 Talkin' all that sh** 
 Soon as I hit 
 Now I got her talkin' like this 
 In a falsetto 
 She like, ?Ooh, ooh, baby, ah, ah, ah, ooh?

 Every time she leave the crib 
 Shawty be comin' right back 
 She talkin' dirty all up in my ear 
 And I'm fixin? to put this dog right on her kitty cat 
 I wasn't gon? show you up 
 But then you got that liquor in ya 
 Callin? last night a fluke 
 Actin' like she didn't remember 
 I hopped up out that linen 
 I'm fixin? to defend my title 
 Fixin? to put your ass to bed 
 Tell me which way would you like it 
 In a falsetto 
 She like, ?Ooh, ooh, baby, ah, ah, ah, ooh?
