Intro/Chorus: 
 She want me to re-mix this dope shit 
 She want me to re-mix this dope shit 
 (Repeat) 
 V1 (sing): 
 All day long you been workin' baby 
 And all night long I'm gon be workin' baby 
 Feelin' up on ya like I'm suppose to 
 Pinning me up on ya like a poster 
 Give your lips to me, those hips to me 
 I'm all over you like the credits on the CD 
 This energy 
 'Our Sin-ergy? 
 All into you 
 You all into me 
 And the world knows my name 
 'Cause they can hear her scream "Radio Killah" from Japan to Pakistan 
 And from Beijing to Paris, France 
 They can hear her making love to this Atlan-- 
 My Sex Intelligence makes all you otha niggas irrelevant 
 And she screaming Re-mix this dope shit 
 In the room like an elephant 
 When she's with me it's Heaven Sent 
 And she screaming 
 (V2: (rap)) 
 You mite wanna ride out 
 Cause yeah boy I'm heavy on the block 
 Drive-by 
 Tear da sides out 
 Hope she don't find out 
 How a nigga PUT IT DOWN 
 After great sex there's this FANCY-ass lifestyle 
 Bettin on horses 
 Racing in Porsches 
 Just a small portion of a muthafuckin fortune 
 Carolina Acres 
 Sittin' on my porches 
 Scenes from the mountains money greener than this forest 
 I'll always a-dore ya 
 I will always love ya 
 'Cause I'm thinkin' of pleasing you even after I fuck ya 
 Cause there's anotha level 
 After that otha level 
 He's on that plane level 
 And I'm Space Shuttle 
 My Sex Intelligence makes all you otha niggas irrelevant 
 And she screaming Re-mix this dope shit 
 In the room like an elephant 
 When she's with me it's Heaven Sent 
 And she screaming Re-mix dope shit 
 Bridge/Breakdown: 
 Say what you want 
 Girl you know you miss me 
 Shawty I'm the realist 
 You know I'm the illest 
 I ain't goin' nowhere 
 Who da fucks' gonna replace me? 
 And just for you I'ma drop another CD 
 (You don't care, I don't care 
 We can do this any, 
 Everywhere, 
 6-7-20-11 
 I'ma drop that Love Affair) 
 (Repeat) 
 Outro Out: 
 O yeah [9x]
