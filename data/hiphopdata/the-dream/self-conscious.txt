You don't have to be self-conscious. 
 I got you boo, I got you boo 
 I got you boo, I got you boo 
 I got you boo, I got you boo 
 I love your eyes in the morning 
 Even though you beg not to look your way 
 I love your smile in the morning 
 Even without the gloss 
 You look fine to me 
 Forget about the world whenever I'm with you 
 So forget about the world whenever you're with me 
 If there's something broke then I will fix it 
 Girl lay in my arms 
 You will never feel alone 
 You don't have to be self-conscious 
 I love everything about you baby I promise 
 Don't be hard on yourself 
 Really there's nothin', that can change the way I feel, I'm for real 
 If my love could kill 
 Love, love, love, love, love 
 I'm a love your body all night girl 
 Stop talkin' 'bout you gettin' thick and make love to me 
 I'm a kiss your face all night girl 
 Goin' straight for the dimples in your cheeks, even though you hate it 
 Girl forget about the world whenever you're with me, if you swear to never front, I swear I'll never leave 
 And I will keep the secrets, very deep in me 
 You will never be alone 
 You don't have to be self-conscious 
 I love everything about you, baby I promise 
 Don't be hard on yourself 
 Really there's nothin', that can change the way I feel, I'm for real 
 If my love could kill 
 Love, love, love, love, love
