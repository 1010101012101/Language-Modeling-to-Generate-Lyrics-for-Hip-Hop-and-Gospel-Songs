Now I'm lookin' through my CD collection 
 The last time it was right behind confessions 
 I'm looking for the right cover, the name's in red letters 
 Can't wait to pop it in my base and put our bodies together 
 I'm fitna stunt like my daddy up in here 
 Girl you got my lips hangin' off your ear 
 Clean the CD, check for scratches, get up on my mattress 
 Now we doin' it to Kelly's 12 play 
 You can't ruin it, I'm doin' it to Kelly's 12 play 
 Like a DJ we screwin' it while we doin' to Kelly's 12 play 
 Ooh, ooh, oohin' it, I'm doin' it to Kelly's 12 play 
 Your body's the cup, my body's the coffee 
 And I'm brewin' it while we doin' it to Kelly's 12 play 
 We gon' come up off the bed, push up to the dresser 
 Got her all up on my CD player, 
 Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip back to seven 
 And we both sweatin' it out like it's a fire up in here 
 Reach my hand up to the remote, gotta play that one more again 
 As we repeat steps 1 through 12 
 She like thank you Dream, I'm like no thank you Kelly 
 I'm fitna stunt like my daddy up in here 
 Girl, you got my lips hangin' off your ear 
 Clean the CD, check for scratches, get up on my mattress 
 Now we doin' it to Kelly's 12 play 
 You can't ruin it, I'm doin' it to Kelly's 12 play 
 Like a DJ we screwin' it while we doin' to Kelly's 12 play 
 Ooh, ooh, oohin' it, I'm doin' it to Kelly's 12 play 
 Your body's the cup, my body's the coffee 
 And I'm brewin' it while we doin' it to Kelly's 12 play 
 CD spinnin', I got you in the mood 
 Everything he say I'mma do 
 And I'mma keep it gangsta and stay true 
 Baby I promise just hear me through 
 So let me hear those, ooh, ooh, ooh, awws 
 We almost at the end, girl let it out 
 12, 24, 36, 48 
 If you up for 60 shawty press play 
 I'm stuntin' like my daddy up in here 
 Girl you got my lips hangin' off your ear 
 She pops out the CD, pops in another, we under the cover 
 Now we doin' it to Dream's love hate
