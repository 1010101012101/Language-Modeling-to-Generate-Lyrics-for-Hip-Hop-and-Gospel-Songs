Promise me you'll make me better 
 Promise me you're here for me 
 Can you love me for what I am 
 And love me for what I can be 
 Say you're nothing like them other girls 
 Girl you're nothing like them other girls 
 And for that I'll cry for you 
 And for that I'll die for you 
 Where Have You Been 
 I'm all fucked up now 
 It's all fucked up now 
 And I'm all destroyed 
 Where Have You Been 
 I needed you then 
 Where were you then, it's all your fault 
 Where Have You Been 
 But I'm glad you're here now 
 Hold me now, shit, I'm so lost 
 Where Have You Been 
 You took your time, I'm glad you're in my life 
 Now make this right 
 Where Have You Been 
 Now that we're together 
 I can curse you, I don't ask you what took you so long 
 Now that we're together 
 First I wanna say I love you 
 And secondly what kind shit you've been on 
 You mess around with them other girls 
 Knowing that them got nothing on me 
 I'm messing around with them girls 
 No they will never got nothing on you 
 But I'm glad that the sun finally shined my way 
 Ever since you came around I ain't even the same 
 Saved my life, and I owned it to ya baby 
 Where Have You Been 
 I'm all fucked up now 
 It's all fucked up now 
 I'm so destroyed 
 Where Have You Been 
 I needed you then 
 And where were you then, it's all your fault 
 Where Have You Been 
 You almost lost me 
 I almost lost you 
 Tell me what to do 
 Where Have You Been 
 All my life, here's your chance to make it right 
 Where Have You Been 
 Just when I thought my life was over 
 God sent you right me way 
 I needed a super woman to save me from this place 
 Follow me and never drop the bomb 
 That I would never find love, now that I found true love 
 I'm never giving it up 
 Where Have You Been 
 I'm all fucked up now 
 It's all fucked up now 
 And I'm all destroyed 
 Where Have You Been 
 I needed you then 
 Where were you then, it's all your fault 
 Where Have You Been 
 But I'm glad you're here now 
 Hold me now, shit, I'm so lost 
 Where Have You Been 
 You took your time, I'm glad you're in my life 
 Now make this right 
 Where Have You Been 
 Where, baby, where, baby where...
