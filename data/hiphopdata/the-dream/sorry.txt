I know, I know it's too late for sorry 
 I know, I know it's too late for sorry 
 I know, I know it's too late for sorry 
 Girl I know, I know it's too late for sorry 
 I know, that you will never ever forgive me 
 And I know, I will never find no one more special that hmmmm 
 Stupid, so stupid 
 What was I doing 
 And if I was you, I would have left my ass too (hmmmm hmmmm) 
 I lost my girl 
 And no one's standing next too me 
 I need the love 
 With you is where rather I rather be 
 I ain't worth nothing 
 Just toss me out into the sea 
 If you're in love, don't yooh dare sing along with me (whoa) 
 I'm going to press rewind 
 And fall in love again with (hmmmmm) you 
 I wish I never lied 
 Shoulda been true (o yessir) 
 I lost my girl 
 And no one's standing next too me 
 I need the love 
 With you is where rather I rather be 
 I ain't worth nothing 
 Just toss me out into the sea 
 If you're in love, don't yooh dare sing along with me (whoa) 
 I know, I know it's too late for sorry 
 I know, I know it's too late for sorry 
 I know, I know, I know 
 I know, I know it's too late for sorry 
 I know, I know it's too late for sorry 
 (Fade out)
