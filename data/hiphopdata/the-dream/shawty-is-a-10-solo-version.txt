Shawty rock to the beat for ya boy 
 Shawty 
 Do it 
 Rock to the beat for ya boy 
 Radio killa, killa, killa 
 Shawty fly, shawty tight 
 Shoulda stayed there all night 
 With you (you) with you 
 I missed ya, picked ya 
 Now its time i 
 Get back up with you (you) girl with you 
 Oh yeah 
 We used to kick up at the park 
 Now she's all grown up 
 Rockin' them stilettos 
 Jumpin' up out of that mercedes truck 
 It was kiesha 
 It was sonya 
 It was tonya 
 It was monique 
 It was neesee 
 It was keke 
 Now that I see you at 23 
 All I can say is 
 Man I don't need no hook for this hit 
 'Cause shawty right there is ten, a ten 
 Shawty you a ten 
 A ten 
 Shawty you a ten 
 A ten 
 Shawty you a ten 
 A ten, oh yeah 
 Dior jeans 
 Her walk so mean 
 Burberry fragance on my shirt from when she 
 (Hugged) me 
 Hard as a rock from when she touched me 
 Thinkin' now that she would've loved me 
 What it is, what it ain't, tell me what to do 
 I know I'm late but destiny brought me back to you 
 Time went by, turned you into a butterfly 
 So I say hello, tell yo goodbye 
 It was kiesha 
 It was sonya 
 It was tonya 
 It was monique 
 It was neesee 
 It was keke 
 Now that I see you at 23 
 All I can say is 
 Man I don't need no hook for this hit 
 'Cause shawty right there is ten, a ten 
 Shawty you a ten

 If she fine, shawty a dime 
 You should tip her, you should tip her 
 If she good, and you love her 
 You should tip her, you should tip her 
 If she fix you eggs and grits in the morning 
 Man you should tip her, you should tip her 
 Pancakes with the bacon on the side 
 (You should tip me, you should tip me)
