 Hey Its Loso Incase you Ain't Know So Ay Dream 
 Let Me Tell you About Shorty 
 Shorty Is The Shh Shh Shh Suga Honey Iced-Tea 
 Prettiest one I See Lil Mama Icey 
 They Say She A Pieces 
 I Heard They are Feisty 
 You Know How To Treat Her 
 She'll Be Sweeter Den A Hi-C 
 Clean Up Very Nicely 
 Shoes Are Kinda Pricey 
 Match Em Up Precisely Good Jeans Nice Tee 
 Like Her Food Spicy 
 And She Is Tha Same 
 Hotter Then A Flame But I Do Not No Her Name 
 Is It Keisha? Is It Tiesha? 
 Maybe Lisa, Or Theresa, 
 It Could Be Tia, Maybe Aaliyah, 
 I Guess I'll Find Out One Day Before That 
 Ima Say 
 Shawty Fly, Shawty Tight 
 Shoulda Stayed There All Night 
 With You (You) With You 
 I Missed Ya, Picture 
 Now Its Time I 
 Get Back Up With You (You) 
 Girl With You 
 Oh Yeah 
 We Used To Kick Up At The Park 
 Now She's All Grown Up (Up) 
 Rockin' Them Stilettos 
 Jumpin' Up Outta That Mercedes Truck (Truck) 
 It Was Kiesha 
 It Was Sonya 
 It Was Tonya 
 It Was Monique 
 It Was Nece 
 It Was Keke 
 Now I See You At 23

 Dior Jeans 
 A Walk So Mean 
 Burberry Fragance On My Shirt From When She 
 Hugged Me 
 Hard As A Rock From When She Touched Me 
 Thinkin' Now That She Would've Loved Me 
 What It Is, What It Ain't, Tell Me What To Do 
 I Know I'm Late But Destiny Brought Me Back To You 
 Time Went By Turned You Into A Butterfly 
 So I Say Hello, Tell Yo Nigga Goodbye 
 It Was Kiesha 
 It Was Sonya 
 It Was Tonya 
 It Was Monique 
 It Was Nece 
 It Was Keke 
 Now That I See You At 23

 And I Don't Need No Hook For This Shit

 If She Fine, If Shawty Is A Dime 
 You Should Tip Her, You Should Tip Her 
 If She Ya Girl, and You Love Her 
 You Should Tip Her, You Should Tip Her 
 If She Fix You Eggs and Grits In The Morning 
 You Should Tip Her, You Should Tip Her 
 Pancakes With The Bacon On The Side 
 (You Should Tip Me, You Should Tip Me)
