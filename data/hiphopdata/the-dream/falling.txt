 Radio killa 
 Once again 
 You ain't better than us 
 You ain't better than me 
 You ain't better than we 
 You ain't better than b (2x) 
 Talk to em 
 Baby I know I been missin' your calls 
 I been meaning to text ya, I didn't forget ya 
 Baby I been doing my thing but after one listen 
 Things will never be the same 
 And now you callin like baby 
 'Cause now I'm everybodys baby 
 There's no need actin' all crazy 
 There's no need actin' all shady, hey lady 
 Listen baby remember when I was tried to be your baby 
 And now I'm on the screen and you can get me off 
 You on the sideline watch me ball (swish, bitch) 
 I'm ballin 
 All these chicks keep callin 
 You the one I try to put my all in 
 But now you fallin' 
 Now your heartbeats fallin' (2x) 
 Baby I can understand the fact that I wasn't your man 
 Why I didn't even stand a chance 
 Hey listen baby I ain't even gon diss you I'm gonna miss you 
 'Cause I really miss kissin' you 
 But baby remember when I used to be you baby
