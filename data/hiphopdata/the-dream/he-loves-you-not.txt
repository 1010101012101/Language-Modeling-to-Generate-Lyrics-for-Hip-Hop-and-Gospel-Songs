Give it your all girl, give it all ya got 
 You can take a chance and take your best shot 
 Say what you want girl, do whatcha do 
 He's never gonna, gonna make it with you 
 Your pullin' petals of a flower tryin' to getcha way 
 Keep pullin' 'til it says what you wanna say 
 Girl you can pick a field full of daisies 
 But he'd still be my baby 
 And I know you can hardly wait 'til I'm away from him 
 He instinctively, I know what your thinkin' 
 You'll be givin' him an open invitation 
 But my baby won't be taken in 
 You can pout your cherry lips 
 Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss 
 (Sweet kiss) 
 You can bat your pretty eyes 
 He ain't got his hands tied 
 No chains to unlock 
 So free to do what he wants 
 He's into what he's got 
 He loves me, he loves you not 
 No matter what you do 
 He's never gonna be with you 
 He's into what he's got 
 He loves me, he loves you not 
 You're the kinda girl that's always up for do or dare 
 Only want him just because he's there 
 Always lookin' for a new ride 
 The grass is greener on the other side 
 You're the kinda girl who's not used to hearin' no 
 (No) 
 All your lovers try to take you where you wanna go 
 (Go) 
 Doesn't matter how hard you try 
 Your never gonna get with my guy 
 No chains to unlock 
 So free to do what he wants 
 (What he wants) 
 He's into what he's got 
 (And that's me) 
 He loves me, he loves you not 
 No matter what you do 
 He's never gonna be with you 
 (With you) 
 He's into what he's got 
 He loves me, he loves you not 
 Doesn't matter what you do 
 He's never gonna be with you 
 Give it your all girl, give it all ya got 
 You can take a chance and take your best shot 
 Say what you want girl, do whatcha do 
 He's never gonna make it with you 
 You can pout your cherry lips 
 Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss 
 (Sweet kiss) 
 You can bat your pretty eyes 
 (Pretty eyes) 
 He ain't got his hands tied
