Yeah! Radio Killa 
 She's what you want (eh) 
 I'm what you need (eh) 
 I was your baby (eh) 
 You had all of me (eh) 
 I was the light (Eh) 
 That you couldn't see (eh) 
 How long you gotta go along 
 Pretending that she's me 
 Just yesterday you were leaving 
 Today she is so deceiving 
 I was the the one that was down for ya! 
 But you left me for Miss America-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca 
 America-ca-ca-ca 
 But you left me for Miss America-ca-ca 
 Left me for miss America-ca-ca 
 Left me (left me) 
 You had it good (eh) 
 Now it's all bad (eh) 
 I wanted love (eh) 
 She wants half (eh) 
 Never know how mad I do (eh) 
 It's messed up for what's she is putting you trough 
 Wish we could go back 
 To just me and you 
 Just yesterday you were leaving 
 Today she is so deceiving 
 I was the the one that was down for ya! 
 But you left me for Miss America-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca 
 America-ca-ca-ca 
 But you left me for Miss America-ca-ca 
 Left me for miss America-ca-ca 
 Left me (left me)
