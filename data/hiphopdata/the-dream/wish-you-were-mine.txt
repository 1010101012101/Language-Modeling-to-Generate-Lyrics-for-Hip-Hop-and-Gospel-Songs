I just wanna roll with you 
 There's nothin' else that I'd rather do 
 I'm shootin' for the stars, maybe we can land on the moon 
 Baby I'd be your fool, you're so dope and cool 
 But you're with this other guy, maybe some other time 
 But damn, I wish you were mine 
 I wish you were mine 
 I wish you were mine 
 I just wanna lay with you - can I spend all day with you? 
 Usually I'm not that guy, but there's something 'bout you I like 
 I wanna be the one, when it's all said and done 
 But I may never get the chance cause you got a man 
 But damn, I wish you were mine 
 I wish you were mine 
 I wish you were mine 
 I love your girl shit 
 And really I'm sorry, but not really sorry at all 
 And I don't wanna start shit, but I know that I'm starting shit 
 Get rid of that starter kit and come on 
 Girl I wish you were mine 
 Girl I wish you were mine 
 I wish you were mine 
 Why we always on something that somebody else tries? 
 But this ain't like none of them times, I really adore you a lot 
 Trying to make you my girl even though you got a man 
 This ain't no one night stand, shit 
 Stalking you like a fan, shit 
 I'm just playing, shit you know your body's the bomb 
 So you'll do whatever you want, you got me in my falsetto 
 Singing all this sweet shit all up in your flower bone 
 I'm ready to make every time feel like your first time 
 I know he's waiting at home 
 But thinking 'bout it ain't a crime, 
 I wish you were mine 
 I wish you were mine 
 I wish you were mine 
 I wish you were mine 
 I wish you were mine
