One day I'll have a million words to explain, 
 Some day I will love you in every way... I... 
 In Time u'll b mine, 
 And I'll luv you even though 
 Today the sun don't shine. 
 And I'm willin' to give me all of you 
 No lie I'm willing to build it all for you 
 I see, one day I'll be 
 More than just everything 
 And I know that I haven't learned it all 
 Just know that I will b there when you call 
 It's young love but I have made up my mind 
 But we will grow, You will know 
 In time...
