Eh eh eh eh. 
 Eh eh eh eh. 
 My mumma told me that this could happen to me. 
 That she would grow to be this beautiful woman but I just couldn't see. 
 But I had my blinders on I was in my zone and I hadn't thought of us in my head somehow it turned us off. 
 And then I met her but she wasn't like you and I dropped my head thinkin' what did I do, oh man 
 I love you, girl you love me. but I just couldn't see, tomorrow. baby and I can't fall you and I didn't see us through, now I know in my heart you will always be, the greatest ex ever. 
 Now I can't do a simple thing like fall asleep, 'cause I can't close my eyes without a day without you in my dreams. 
 Sometimes I just call your phone, just to hear your tone and I never say nothin' just a couple seconds to hear you breathin' then I'm gone. 
 And she's not like you, can't help but to hold my head thinkin' what did I do... oh. 
 I loved you, girl you loved me. but I just couldn't see, tomorrow. baby and I can't fall you and I didn't see us through, now I know in my heart you will always be, the greatest ex ever.
