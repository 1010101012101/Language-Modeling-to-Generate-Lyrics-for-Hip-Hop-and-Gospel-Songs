(The-Dream) 
 Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
 Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
 Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
 Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah 
 Yeah 
 Lemme tell you what happened in '07 
 I became a monster 
 And a killer 
 Next LP better than Thriller 
 So call me Michael 
 Or call me Prince 
 Call me an ***hole 
 'Cause I'm the sh**! 
 Call me ... 
 N**** I'm sick 
 Get paid for running my mouth 
 ***** Call me a snitch 
 Just face it 
 There's no replacing 
 I'm just simply marvelous and amazing 
 And no matter what you can't take that from me 
 My range is as far as God eyes can see 
 I'm amazing 
 Shawty you da sh** 
 They said I wasn't sh** 
 Damn weren't they wrong, yeah 
 Now they in the hood 
 And it's all good 
 Go on play my song, yeah 
 What I want an average n****s can't see it 
 That's why when I do it y'all n****s can't believe it 
 It's up to me you won't see it till I see it 
 And that means you won't see it till I see it (ha!) 
 And imma do it so good you gonna need it 
 So great, don't hate, it must be Jesus 
 It must be Allah 
 It must be Gandhi 
 Snubbed on the Grammy, what else you want from me man? 
 No matter what you can't take this from me 
 My range is as far as God eyes can see 
 I'm amazing (Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) 
 I'm amazing 
 I'm amazing 
 I'm amazing 
 I'm amazing (Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) 
 I'm amazing 
 I'm amazing 
 I'm amazing 
 I'm amazing 
 (Christina Milian) 
 They say she all this 
 They say she all that 
 What'd I do wrong? 
 I'm just on the grind 
 Trying to get mine 
 All on my own, yeah 
 Am I the most hated in the world? 
 And wouldn't change it, I was your girl 
 Don't have to do it 'cause I'm already rich 
 Do it 'cause I wanna, man, I love this sh** 
 Try to keep my smile worthwhile 
 But men turn it upside down 
 Radio Killa, yep, that's where I'm at 
 And we did it all with the world on our back! 
 (Both) 
 No matter what you can't take this from me 
 My range is as far as God eyes can see 
 I'm amazing (Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) 
 I'm amazing 
 I'm amazing 
 I'm amazing 
 I'm amazing (Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) 
 I'm amazing 
 I'm amazing 
 I'm amazing 
 I'm amazing
