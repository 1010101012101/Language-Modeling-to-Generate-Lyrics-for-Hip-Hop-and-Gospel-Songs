You can walk my path, you can wear my shoes 
 Learn to talk like me and be an angel too 
 But maybe you ain't never gonna feel this way 
 You ain't never gonna know me but I know you 
 I'm singing it now, things can only get better 
 They can only get better if we see it through 
 That means me and I mean you too 
 So teach me now that things can only get better 
 They can only get, they only get, take it on from here 
 You know, I know that things can only get better 
 I sometimes lose myself in me, I lose track of time 
 And I can't see the woods for the trees, you set them alight 
 Burn the bridges as you've gone, I'm too weak to fight ya 
 I've got my personal hell to deal with 
 And then you say 
 "Walk my path, wear my shoes 
 Talk like that, I'll be an angel" 
 And things can only get better 
 They can only get better now I found you 
 (Things can only get, can only get) 
 Things can only get better 
 They can only get better now I found you and you and you 
 You have shown me prejudice and greed 
 And you've shown me how I must learn to deal with this disease 
 I look at things now in a different light than I did before 
 And I've found the cause and I think that you can be my cure 
 So teach me to walk your path, wear your shoes 
 Talk like that, I'll be an angel 
 And things can only get better 
 They can only get better now I found you 
 (Things can only get, can only get) 
 Things can only get better 
 They can only get better now I found you 
 Things can only get, can only get 
 Things can only get, can only get 
 Things can only get, things can only get 
 Things can only get 
 Things can only get better 
 They can only get better now I found you 
 (Things can only get, can only get) 
 And you and you and you baby 
 Things can only get better 
 They can only get better now I found you
