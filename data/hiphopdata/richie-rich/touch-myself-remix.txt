(Feat. T-Boz, Jermaine Dupri) 
 Don't stop I'm not finished yet 
 You ain't doin' it right until ya hands get wet 
 Remix, check this uh come on. 
 Don't stop I'm not finished yet 
 You ain't doin' it right until ya hands get wet 
 T-Boz rock on Richie Rich come on 
 Get it straight a player don't hate he congratulate (say what) 
 While you demonstrate you givin' yo N-I-G a break 
 I let ya fingers be the reason that I stay out late 
 When double R come home 
 Ya touchin' teasin' like Case (don't stop) 
 Bringin' the shakes plus joy like Anita Bake 
 All the way from the O to the ATL it ain't safe 
 Playas check yo game swole ballers check nuts 
 And if ya scared go to church 'cause the remix hurts 
 Every night I get away 
 I don't need nobody baby but you you 
 I ain't afraid to touch myself 
 I don't need nobody else but you you yeah 
 A splash in the pool 
 Come home ridin' duals 
 Triple gold game sold not told (yeah yeah) 
 Fuck wit' that nigga all hundred G stacks 
 Kamikaze but yet and still I can't lock down my bazy 
 Due to the jack, ask myself who's the mack 
 On the bed shakin' damn who bringin' home the bacon (me) 
 Thought it was my nigga who was stealin' the guts 
 Richie Rich bangin' hard but she ain't gettin' enough 
 Let me watch nigga 'cause you my boo for shoo (yeah) 
 Goin' brown in the town what the fuck I got to do 
 Spend a gang of loot hella Benzes on the fluke 
 I'm a catcher tell me when it's time to shoot (Don't stop don't stop) 
 I won't be afraid to touch myself 
 It's all right I said it's all right hey 
 I don't think it's wrong to touch yourself 
 Cause ain't nothin' wrong with makin' it feel good 
 Every night I get away 
 I don't need nobody baby but you you 
 I ain't afraid to touch myself 
 I don't need nobody else but you you yeah 
 Who hooked it that nigga Jermaine Dupri 
 Who hooked it uh T-B-O-Z 
 Who hooked it the D-U double B-L-E 
 And if ya scared go to church 'cause the remix hurts 
 (Repeat) 
 Every night I get away 
 I don't need nobody baby but you you 
 I ain't afraid to touch myself 
 I don't need nobody else but you you yeah 
 I hope ya think of me when ya touchin' ya self 
 I hope ya think of me when ya rubbin' yo' body 
 (Repeat)
