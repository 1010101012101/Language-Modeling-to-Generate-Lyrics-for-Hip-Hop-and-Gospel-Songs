Something about the West Coast... 
 Shhh... Don't tell nobody 
 (Something about the West Coast 
 It makes me wanna ride 
 Something about the West Coast 
 Shake it westsiide 
 Throw ya hands up let's riide 
 To the city of the scene 
 Put it on the one get ya body on the dance floor 
 Something about the West Coast It makes me wanna ride) 
 (Repeats until Verse 1) 
 No disrespect it's all love and a muthafucka just feel real good 
 Be like what's poppin' on this side of the muthafuckin' planet 
 Understand me? It's still one love, smokin'. It's just a whole lot 
 More money involved. 
 Leanin' out my zone 
 I roams like mobile phones (right) 
 Rag top 'Vettes Yukons and hundred chromes 
 Silly bitches lie in wait until the day I come home 
 While the phone machine kicks 
 "Biitch Rich ain't at home" (Ha) 
 Six million ways to mob choose one 
 I chose to dispose of those who call theyself foes 
 Foes like bitches tuck they toes like hoes 
 These amateur niggas done turned pro 
 Can't ride with the hi pro glow 
 The boss with the sauce 
 Got receipts to show how much it cost 
 I dedicate this to the ridahs 
 Who like to slip sideways 
 Beware devil's shuttin' down the highway 
 Something about the West Coast 
 Shake it westsiide 
 Throw ya hands up let's riide 
 To the city of the scene 
 Put it on the one get ya body on the dance floor 
 Something about the West Coast It makes me wanna ride 
 (Repeat) 
 How many MC's must get ditched 
 Before somebody say don't fuck with Rich 
 It's evidential the Presedential's up on the wrist 
 Who that new nigga from Oakland 
 With that brand new twist 
 Don't even worry 'bout it 
 Watch yo' neck and chest 
 They don't wanna get 
 Elliott like Mr. Nest 
 Known for flippin' scripts sick duets and mic' rips 
 But now I'm off the hook don't trip 
 Hookers throw yo' skirt up 
 Cruddies throw yo' turf up 
 Hustlers trust her and some of them put that work up 
 'Cause if they ridin' they gone ride tonight 
 When they hit it we to the next light. Believe it. 
 Thou commands me 
 To skyball hands free 
 Sam see I'm havin' some spam hezask me 
 3-0 TV had fiv on it with the Luniz 
 I got five on it. 
 You wanna ride with me 
 That's when you call yo' N-I-G 
 I'd rather be 
 Puttin' the twomp on somethin' thick 
 Big SSL with Nicki Scarf' in the licks 
 Still hittin' licks in the villo with cigarillos 
 Big head C-notes and them light green pillows 
 Tinted windows V dozen on my Benzo 
 The rumble and humble 
 Outdo' versus the indo' 
 That's how it be'z when I smoke for sho' 
 West Coast representin' all O. Believe it. 
 Chorus till end with ad libs 
 X4x4x4x4x4x4x4x4 4 life bitch!
