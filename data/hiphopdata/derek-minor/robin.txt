That made my decision easy like a free throw (swish, swish) 
 Come up out your pocket, so I'm poppin' 
 Ain't no Batman, no, I guess I'm Robin 
 Guess I'm Robin, yeah boy, I guess I'm Robin 
 Guess I'm Robin, come up out your pockets 
 Guess I'm Robin, boy, I guess I'm robbin' 
 Guess I'm Robin', come up out your pockets 
 Open up the fridge, open up the fridge 
 Ain't nothing but old milk and rice again 
 Got like 10 more days until my check hit 
 I don't know how I'm about to feed my kids 
 Guess I grab a sip, pull the drink off 
 Pull up on whoever until I die or hit my payroll 
 Rob this pharmacy, give me the pills and don't you say no 
 (?) pointed at you and don't you move until I say so 
 Do you know what these Zanee get me on the street? 
 Put it in the bag and leave before they call police 
 Too late, I see cops surrounding me 
 Lying violence, I'll take this armed robbery 
 Judge sent me away for like 20 years 
 I said I ain't have no options he ain't tryna hear 
 A menace off the street, the system win again 
 But who's gonna save myself from my environment? 
 Where I'm from, there ain't no heroes 
 That made my decision easy like a free throw (swish, swish) 
 Come up out your pocket, so I'm poppin' 
 Ain't no Batman, no, I guess I'm Robin 
 Guess I'm Robin, yeah boy, I guess I'm Robin 
 Guess I'm Robin, come up out your pockets 
 Guess I'm Robin, boy, I guess I'm robbin' 
 Guess I'm Robin, come up out your pockets 
 Open up the fridge, open up the fridge 
 Ain't nothing but old milk and rice again 
 My mama on dope and she ain't here again 
 What we finna do my daddy in the pin 
 Guess I take the same route 
 They say college get you a job but that can't help me now 
 I don't see no super heroes swoopin in with capes 
 So I'm going save a soul with (?) on my face 
 So I'm going save a soul and don't get in my way 
 I'm gonna put some food on all our dinner plates 
 And that's the trap, the system that we live in 
 'Cause everyday death knock at our door and hope don't live hear 
 Let's pray for help tomorrow 
 Making our decision 
 Death will join our pops in prison 
 You either die a hero or live to be a villain 
 Did the best he knew 
 But either way the cycle continues
