Welcome to Minorville... 
 Where the bigger, the better... 
 Or the flashier, the greater... 
 My worth's not defined by who I am... 
 Or what I have. 
 I came up from the bottom, 
 Said hello to Satan fo' I cracked through the earth's crust 
 (What all they do) 
 Post up, drink good, and smoke blunts. 
 When I was comin' up they was clappin' at y'all, 
 But nowadays, them choppers givin' applause... 
 See if the love of money the root of evil, It's no wonder why the culture brainwashing our people. 
 Hey, where else would college graduates parade around as dope boys, 
 And dumb they whole life down, oh boy! 
 He got a bad dime piece though, 
 And she gon' bear it all for a video. 
 The networks making tons o' dough, 
 We out here lookin' like CB4. 
 I feel like we musta missed it, 
 Built a whole society around riches! 
 While kids in Africa put water on they wishlist, 
 We buy a couple mo' benzes. 
 All I hear is... 
 Gimme (x21) 
 Ah Yeah! 
 Mo' money, mo' cars, 
 Bigger house. 
 Mo' Mo' Yards! 
 Mo' fame, mo' applause... 
 But why settle for that, 
 When you can have it all. 
 Flippin' through a hundred channels, 
 It ain't nothin' on! 
 Then I see this preacher say he praying for my soul. 
 But if I really want the blessings of the Lord to shine, 
 I need to buy this magic oil for $9.99. 
 So if I put this chicken grease on my fo'head, 
 And spin in circles 5 times, like you said... 
 You tellin' me tomorrow I'ma have no debt, 
 Even though my credit bad, and I ain't got a job yet! 
 I smell a crook here in the castle, 
 And I ain't talkin' fashion. 
 To sell hope to broke folk, 
 Promise 'em all a mansion. 
 They turned God into a genie, 
 And you Aladdin. 
 Makin' a fool out of Church while the world laughin'. 
 See you ain't gotta be a Christian 
 To notice there's somethin' fishy 
 When the church is like casinos with slot machines missing. 
 Yo' congregation put food on they wishlist, 
 You out driving round benzes. 
 All I here is... 
 Gimme (21x) 
 Ah yeah! 
 Mo' money, mo' cars, 
 Bigger house. 
 Mo' Mo' Yards! 
 Mo' fame, mo' applause... 
 But why settle for that, 
 When you can have it all. 
 Buy my new CD when it drop, 
 And let ya' friends know. 
 Wanna book me for a show? 
 Here go my info. 
 I'd be lyin' if I ain't say that sometimes it's just to get dough. 
 Let's say it's 'cause my 'Family Matters," 
 I can't have my "Winslow!" 
 Our Father, 
 Who art in heaven, 
 Who blessed this flow. 
 I want a stellar, but I settle for a grammy though. 
 I want a be a movie star, at least gimme a cameo... 
 Overlookin' all the lord's done before! 
 Hey I got everything! 
 My wife a fly dame, 
 Bunch a twitter folllowers'll gas my up like octane. 
 Get love in the south, 
 Lotta artists say, 
 "You hot man!" 
 Plus the Lord SAVED me, 
 It's 'sposed to be bout HIS fame. 
 I know people are losing business to jockey for my position, 
 While I steady look at Heaven, 
 Beggin' for somethin' different. 
 The Father gave me EVERYTHING on my wishlist, 
 And now I'm dreamin' bout benzes. 
 Hands out like... 
 Gimme (21x) 
 Ah Yeah! 
 Mo' money, mo' cars, 
 Bigger house. 
 Mo' Mo' Yards! 
 Mo' fame, mo' applause... 
 But why settle for that, 
 When you can have it all.
