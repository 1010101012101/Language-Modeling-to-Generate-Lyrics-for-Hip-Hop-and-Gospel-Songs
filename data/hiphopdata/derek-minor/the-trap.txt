The Wright Way 
 It's a cold world, on the south side, when they catch you, with a .45, the trap 
 And the world don't care about us but they want more for the cameras, the trap 
 Blow your brains out on Facebook Live, you a hashtag, that's your whole life, the trap 
 Mama told us, that we need God, but the rent due is the most high, the trap 
 Derek Minor 
 Yeah I know a couple dealers 
 And a couple gangbangers 
 Tryna run off with they money 
 Guarantee they will steel you with the stainless 
 Master used to call us monkeys 
 'Til we started clipping with bananas 
 Throwing seeds at your head 
 Now your melon fruit salad 
 Whole body full of rage 
 Whole soul full of pain 
 When hurt people hurt people 
 You gon' hear the chi' chi' from the gage 
 Yeah I'm talking 'bout race 
 And any topic I can think 
 And I said to your face 
 Well hallelujah that's grace 
 This record might be the end of me 
 Yeah, I'm probably gon' have some enemies 
 Don't shoot the messenger 
 This what the Lord has been giving me 
 Someone to re-envision our history, yeah 
 You got a college degree 
 You made it out of the trap 
 You are not a politician 
 Why don't you get back to rap? 
 By the way, they say when you get paid 
 And you get a lil' fame that everything change 
 But I can't tell, I still feel the same 
 'Cause every time I'm in the store 
 The police watching me, watching me, watching me 
 My 800 credit store, help me get it low 
 But my neighbors think I'm selling dope 
 Oh my, I'm just giving y'all a glimpse into my life 
 Even if you color blind, your vision still in black or white 
 You see me 
 The Wright Way 
 God bless the trap

 God bless the trap 
 God bless the trap, yeah 
 God bless the trap 
 God bless the trap, yeah 
 God bless the trap 
 God bless the trap, yeah
