 Woah, our Father who art in heaven 
 Devil walk 'round with that Mac 11 
 Devil walk 'round with that packs he selling 
 I'm just trying to eat with all my brethren 
 God bless the trap 
 God bless the trap

 Snipe you in your drop top Mustang, now you run 'round headless horseman 
 Seeing it, play the loop, chose to comment on the post 
 They'll say "you should put them savage monkeys right back on the boat" 
 They won't talk about how we in these streets and everybody poor 
 They won't talk 'bout how we can't get jobs and all we got is dope 
 That's that would have drive you crazy when you trying to feed your babies 
 They just trying to jail and chain me, CCA trying to trade me, yeah

 Now I lay me down to sleep 
 I pray the Lord my soul you keep 
 Bring salvation to the streets 
 Forgive 'em they just tryna eat 
 All (?) let us pray 
 Please don't let the .40 spray 
 Can't afford to pay for grace 
 Don't let 'em die before they wake 
 They hopeless 'fore they focus on the mil' 
 Posted selling dope to play the bills 
 Bogus only way they know to live 
 Blowing and they don't know that you forgive 
 Your mercy on their soul to hold a deal 
 Even smokers on the coke and pills 
 I seen 'em roll but they don't know yo' will 
 Bless the trap and let 'em know you're real

 Sitting in (?) feelin' like 8 Ball 
 'Round here, we just tryna escape the pitfalls 
 Crime rate high as (?), tryna evade laws 
 Either you got a good hoop game or you slang walk, game raw 
 Have 'em out with the (?), before he turn 16 
 Tryna come up on the block 
 Tryna take a half ounce, whip it up, turn it to a whole thing 
 Mama praying that he stop 
 Mama praying that the God she serve gon' give him a holla 
 But the chances of them hollow tips gon' make Momma holla
