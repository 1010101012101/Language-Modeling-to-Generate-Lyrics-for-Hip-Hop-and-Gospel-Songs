spoken: 
 Time is the fourth dimension, and a measure in which events can be ordered from the past, through the present, into the future. All signify that we are all bound to time.

 I be on that work like I'm 'posed to be 
 I be on this here until you bury me 
 Building his empire that never die I bet he'll be here till the end of time 
 That's forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 Ever, ever ever, till the end of time 
 That's forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 Ever, ever ever, till the end of time 
 That's forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 Ever, ever ever, till the end of time 
 That's forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 Ever, ever ever, till the end of time

 Grinding, working, hustling on this mission, I will never quit 
 Every single track you put in front of me I'm killing it 
 Not for money, fame, attention, this is what I'm getting at 
 Christ the King and this his empire, he don't deserve no less than that 
 I'ma be snapping on tracks, you should know if you get in my way that I never let up 
 There's some people that need to hear truth, they get beat down by lies and get told that they'll never get up 
 Few of 'em might even pull out their strap and go yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-yak with the gun 
 I'ma tell 'em that God he want all of your pain, and I'm praying that one day you feelin' his love 
 That's all I know, straight live by that 
 And I'm 'bout that life, I die by that 
 Believe what I say, we are not going away, this is the work of the Lord 
 Grinding for all of my days, ain't no more play, this what he makin' me for, I'm gone 
 I be on that work like I'm 'posed to be 
 I be on this here until you bury me 
 Building his empire that never die I bet he'll be here till the end of time 
 That's forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 Ever, ever ever, till the end of time 
 That's forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 Ever, ever ever, till the end of time 
 That's forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 Ever, ever ever, till the end of time 
 That's forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 Ever, ever ever, till the end of time 
 Lecrae 
 Still wearing church clothes, loafing in my pennies boy 
 Talking out they neck about me, looking silly boy 
 Hallowed be Thy name, bless all these shallow souls 
 I'm focused on forever, don't know what tomorrow holds 
 Wanna go to war with God? You ain't gon' make it 
 Makin' them arrogant statements, talk about money you makin' 
 We know you fakin', we know your whole reputation 
 And if the shoe fits you better tie your shoe laces 
 He is so patient with these rebel nations, embracing they hatred 
 I would've burned the whole world for insubordination 
 Yeah, but until the end of time 
 His grace is sweeter than wine, your god ain't greater than mine, boy 
 I be on that work like I'm 'posed to be 
 I be on this here until you bury me 
 Building his empire that never die I bet he'll be here till the end of time 
 That's forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 Ever, ever ever, till the end of time 
 That's forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 Ever, ever ever, till the end of time 
 That's forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 Ever, ever ever, till the end of time 
 That's forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 Ever, ever ever, till the end of time

 Ok, forever bruh, that's a long time, and getting in this game, that's a long line 
 But I cut through with my Kung Fu and go Jackie Chan on my first rhyme 
 'Cause I kicks it, Bruce Lee cousin, if I'm on the track that must mean somethin' 
 Them sixteens that go click bang, when that subwoofer start mean muggin' 
 My team jumpin', been about that life, look at here, you ain't close to the top height 
 Looking for the proof, they should come up with a name of 'em looking like they comin' for the kill on the mic 
 Yikes, sniper tracks in tongue of these artists, such a pro I'm cunning these hoarders 
 I'm having 'em thinking they ill, till the cab that I put 'em on, vocal I'm just getting started 
 Phantom zero to a hundred in that lane, comin' and runnin' and gunnin' what I gain 
 I pop pop, I'm a semi-automatic, get naked for the server, coming to cut 'em with them lyrics 
 Been cliqued up, my clique get busted, yeah they shook harder, they fallin' like a pi√±ata, like super-sweet 
 I'm exposing 'em, looking inside of 'em, show 'em that nothing gon' last but the truth in me 
 Now friend and enemy done dropped to their knees, hail to the Son of God, he drop drop to the King 
 King, nothing impossible, look at that Paul the apostle that carried the dream 
 Dream like Martin the King, then enter the man of the legend, who he? 
 God is the Alpha Omega, Beginning and End, and the Lamb and the Shepherd of Sheep 
 Derek Minor 
 I be on that work like I'm 'posed to be 
 Till the end of time 
 I be on this here until you bury me 
 Till the end of time
