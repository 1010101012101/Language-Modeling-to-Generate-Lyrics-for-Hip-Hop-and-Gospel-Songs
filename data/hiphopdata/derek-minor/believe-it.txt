Yes Lord 
 Oh yes Lord yes Lord 
 Thank you choir for that amb selection 
 Father God that you got them sounding mighty fine today 
 Now now. Deacons I'm gon'need you to stand in front of the door 
 Oh you may need to stand in front of the door. 
 I believe ima say some things some folk ain't gonna like tonight 
 Oh you ain't gon' like me 
 Can I testify 
 Can I testify 
 Church 
 By Now you should know that I mean what I say and you better believe it 
 I just say this once, I won't repeat myself so you better believe it 
 You better believe it x8 
 Please pay attention, everybody better settle in 
 Minor get to preaching on these tracks like a reverend 
 Not like, some of the ones in the spotlight 
 On private jets, better straighten up and fly right 
 That treat the church like a brothel, they prostitute the truth 
 How many people gotta die tonight before we stop preaching to the choir 
 They get scared when I talk about the drugs, and the gun 
 And the hood, and the poor, like if we don't pay attention it won't happen any more 
 In the suburbs, where the money at, they send it overseas before they send it to Chicago 
 Cop kill a kid bet they talk about Chicago 
 Yeah the hood is messed up, pray before you judge tho 
 Who finna stand up 
 Can't turn my back on the culture, be a vulture 
 I approach ya, and tell you how my family in hood 
 And it looking good, so if I move to L.A 
 I'll never be Hollywood 
 Yes this is personal, it's a not a show 
 If it was just for dough, what's the point of even doing it for 
 When it's people that I know straight hooked to dope 
 I got truth that they need know, let me talk about it 
 By Now you should know that I mean what I say and you better believe it 
 I just say this once, I won't repeat myself so you better believe it 
 You better believe it x8 
 They don't wanna hear what I gotta say 
 They don't wanna hear what I gotta say 
 They don't wanna hear me talk about how Sunday service 
 Is the most segregated time in the USA 
 What kinda sermon do you think that preach to everybody watching 
 Here's another man shot and we don't talk about the topic 
 We don't even pray about it, all we say about it 
 No comment, we won't rock a boat about it 
 I ain't scared, It don't matter what the cost, I'm say it 
 Till its prices on my head and I'm dead 
 Go to chucky cheese if you looking for a token 
 I am only bout spitting real truth that is potent 
 Fight for the found and the lost, slave and the free 
 And I'll give my life 'cause he gave it for me 
 I speak for a king and we made in his image 
 So when you looking at yourself, his reflection in the mirror 
 Gimme me the mic, run it again, y'all in my aim now 
 I'm running from nothing, I give 'em the key, unlocking the chain now 
 I say what I want, and I'm keeping it real, that is the wave now 
 I know what I'm doing, they seeing the movement 
 Its making 'em ready for change now 
 Give it away now, give it a, give it a give it away now 
 Give it away now, give it a, give it a give it away now 
 A lot of people talk, I ain't heard a thang now 
 And if I say it, then believe it right away now 
 By Now you should know that I mean what I say and you better believe it 
 I just say this once, I won't repeat myself so you better believe it 
 You better believe it x8
