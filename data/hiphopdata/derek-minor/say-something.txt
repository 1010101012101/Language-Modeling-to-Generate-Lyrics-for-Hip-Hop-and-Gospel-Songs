(Derek Minor) 
 Uh, marijuana in his jeans pocket 
 Nine millimeter, you don't want that boy to cock it 
 Chevy Caprice classy 
 DVD and the dash bumpin' that Flocka like, "I will let these boys have it" 
 Twisted mentally, hold his pistol like "Lord, thank ya" 
 He on a mission, no superstition, he is a gangsta 
 In the Jungle, the cops is poachers, they want him captive 
 Rival gang, he killed they homie, they want him blasted 
 Uh-huh, and that's like every single day brother 
 In the hood I know the Devil is undercover 
 So my goal is: pull back the covers 
 And pray to God that he saves some fathers for all our mothers 
 What I see in my backyard is no goodie 
 Just found out that black men can't wear hoodies 
 They see a mug shot, I see Creation of God 
 They need the Spirit to grip his soul, soften his heart 
 Put the gun away, you don't wanna blast me 
 'Cause the Father makes men like a GI Joe factory 
 Life ain't yours to take, homie he ain't havin' it 
 You have no right to break a dish in his china cabinet 
 Oppress people plus broke, it's simple mathematics 
 The Desert E squeeze will flip 'em like gymnastics 
 And I'm supposed to just say nothing? Nah, I'ma SAY SOMETHING 
 (R-Swift) 
 Cops, armors, and shots create insomniacs 
 The concrete jungle we strugglin' for survival at 
 I push hope where reality seems to rival that 
 I want change but become first that's where my 'juana's at 
 Crack in the airwaves, dope in the beats 
 Hypnotized minds, so no hope in the streets 
 Old heads saying that peace is something foreign 
 Too far from the days where they were marching with Martin 
 Priority's departed, I wonder what rearranged them 
 A whole generation and not enough men to raise them 
 From the street, and they wonder where I get my pain from 
 I guess it comes from knowing what can change 'em 
 They say that I'm wasting my time preaching 
 But obviously to me there's no wasting my lines reaching 
 I mix some Martin Luther with rap, a rare lane 
 Truth in the facts, some revolution for spare change 
 (Sho Baraka) 
 I used to wish for the day that I could make it up to Jacob 
 But now I'm on my Jacob, I wrestle with God, wake up 
 Watching these fools, I'm seeing how time's wasted 
 It seems like the finish line moves when I'm racing 
 Surgical rap for those who've been scarred 
 Disconnected from the source, but still getting charged 
 And on the TV, I feel like the people need me 
 My pen speaks freely, I'm something like Phyllis Wheatley 
 Watching when I'm eating the poison, it got me fed up 
 Civil rights music, Malcolm X, Mandela 
 We bump 'Pac, Africans - Bob Feller 
 Music is therapy until times gets better 
 Walking on the streets, I get this disturbing feeling 
 I don't need to hear Uganda to see invisible children 
 Swimming up creek, yeah, life's hard 
 Life's a beach, I see them drowning up in my backyard 
 Yeah, and change doesn't come from closed lips 
 It's hard to greet peace when you live with a closed fist 
 We want that "imago dei", image before the fall 
 He's our perfect picture, win, lose, or draw 
 Life has gotta be more than going to malls 
 Finding a broad, Hammer Time and nailing 'em all 
 This is rap with a cause, saints, sinners and God 
 I will not sell my soul just to get an applause 
 To all involved, I know that the system's flawed 
 Unjust laws has got my people on palls 
 This is the voice of the old Negro city-ans 
 Mysterious bombings of a black-only business 
 Am I the only witness that still feels the persistence? 
 Strong-arm momma, slave-owning Christian 
 Huh ... I'm back in hell again 
 Oh snap, is this about my melanin?
