Now pay attention to me mayn 
 Y'all lucky that I'm not hungry today 
 I could put your favorite rapper on my plate 
 But I would starvin' an hour later 
 'Cause nowadays is music lackin' substance? 
 Is this the best that we come up with million dollar budgets? 
 If you trying to hear the dope truth I got the blood 
 Get connected to source, I'm shinin' 'cause I'm plugged in 
 Hold up, wait a minute 
 Boy you got me messed up! 
 If you think that I'mma sell my soul to write a check off 
 I'm just tryna write a verse so sick you need a check up 
 And tell the homie God is real, so boy you keep your head up! 
 This that motivation you gon need 
 At the table with our enemies 
 Knock him out or make him (?) 
 It ain't nothing you can to me 
 I was blind but I see now 
 Lot of people tryna shut us down 
 But I do it for the Kingdom now 
 This redemption He gon hold us down! 
 I say hold up 
 I been on my business 
 Talkin' true like I'm in church, now tell me can I get a witness? 
 I say hold up 
 What you see is what you get 
 And on the real I know the feel it 
 'Cause I've always been authentic 
 I say hold up 
 You could never hold us 
 If you think that we gon fold up 
 Then I guess you do not know us 
 I say hold up 
 You might have to get me going out 
 'Cause when I'm in it bro you know my teammates with me 
 I say hold up 
 I thought I heard you tell me I had to sell out (I'm not for sale) 
 But I'm still being me on stage at a sell out 
 What's the point of being famous if I can't be the person that I was made to be? 
 Shining the light of the Lord and a hundred percent Minor? 
 That's okay to me 
 I came up from nothing, I'm leaving with nothing 
 2000 like Kobe, I shoot at the buzzer 
 That negative wave, end the discussion 
 Kill all the hate and not leavin' for budgets 
 And whatever calls, so I gotta ball, what you tryin' to say? 
 I call that bull, and it's Michael Jordan, watch it fade away 
 Money and power, money and power 
 So infatuated, with this 
 Money and power, money and power 
 You can't take it with you homie 
 Don't you let it kill you homie 
 You know I feel you homie 
 Let's keep it real homie 
 Can I keep it real homie? 
 Some of us not living life we just breathin to death 
 Knock on the world in your life time then tell me what's left 
 One legacy, when I die will y'all still remember me? 
 I just pray that I'm real as real could be 
 Show y'all what reflect greatness means 
 Till then boy 
 I say hold up 
 I been on my business 
 Talkin' true like I'm in church now tell me can I get a witness? 
 I say hold up 
 What you see is what you get 
 And on the real I know the feeling it 
 'Cause I've always been authentic 
 I say hold up 
 You could never hold us 
 If you think that we gon fold up 
 I guess you do not know us 
 I say hold up 
 You might have to get me going out 
 'Cause when I'm in it bro you know my teammates with me 
 I say hold up 
 I say hold up 
 I say hold up 
 I say hold up
