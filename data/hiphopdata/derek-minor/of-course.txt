 Ok, let me give y'all a new style to run with 
 New ideas to bite 
 New wave to surf on 
 Please prepare the throne, mr minor is home 
 And I'm done putting you on, get Doc on the phone 
 Watch my moves with binoculars to duplicate it 
 But they don't see the big picture so they can't trace it 
 I can teach you how to hustle and then finesse it 
 Have my cheese and my bread quick, make it deep dish 
 Whew, whew, whew, it's never been about the money for me 
 Ugh ugh ugh, it's always been about the kingdom dummy 
 I been talking to the son, he said the Future sunny 
 Got a lot of haters but my momma love me 
 I'm an artist but I'm more close to a trapper 
 'Cause we operate outside of the rules and they can't catch us 
 A lot of people talk but they full of the stuff in pampers 
 Been trying not to hit the button like trump and Nuke me a rapper 
 Of course 
 Hallelujah, oh Lord 
 Where I'm from it go fttttt when the bored
