(Canon) 
 Ay this that wild music 
 That loud music 
 Start a riot in the crowd music 
 That jump around and get sweaty 
 That throw them elbows in they eye music 
 I'm sweaty, get a towel music 
 8 0 8 shake that ground music 
 That walk around in that Kroger 
 Then go act a fool in that aisle music 
 (Chorus: Canon) 
 This that track that make you be right down yo block 
 This that track that make you be right down yo block 
 Bumpin' crowd we too young 'n' wild 
 Bumpin' crowd we too young 'n' wild 
 (Canon) 
 Ay this that wild music 
 That loud music 
 Start a riot in the crowd music 
 That jump around and get sweaty 
 Throw them elbows in they eye music 
 I'm sweaty, get a towel music 
 That 8 0 8 shake the ground music 
 That walk around in that Kroger 
 Then go act a fool in that aisle music 
 Go ride around with no top boy 
 Ain't lookin' round for no cops boy 
 Beat that beat down the block boy 
 Bump 'n' no tryin' to turn it down boy 
 Summer time it get hot boy 
 Trip around in my zone boy 
 I'm Gucci Gucci get loud music 
 I'm good cousin 
 I'm gone boy 
 If your church feel trialed you ain't geeked up 
 All my potnas round ya are inked up 
 Ten toes deep you know we linked up 
 Got the Spirit in us homie, we G'ed up 
 Y'all know when we act up 
 E'erybody start actin' up 
 Follow me as I follow Christ 
 And I saw the King 'n' got jacked up 
 I'm wild, true dat 
 Not stupid foolish 
 My speakers, I blew dat 
 And I'm RMG and y'all knew dat 
 (Chorus: Canon) 
 (Derek Minor fka PRo) 
 Ay this that wild music 
 That loud music 
 Bodysurfing the crowd music 
 Big boned my body type 
 But I'm that dude that might do it 
 Elbows, Mutumbo 
 When I come through y'all better move 
 My home girls are final 
 Messing up they hair do 
 King kong on my bass 
 Sweat all on my face 
 I don't think you should hate, homie this ain't the place 
 Y'all know what it is, tattooed on my skin, 1 1 to that 6 gone get like this 
 Goin' down the block my truck is swervin lanes, lookin' 'n' yellin' out my window "unashamed" 
 Yo momma 'n' 'em keep lookin' at me like he insane 
 And they might be right, so give me space 
 Try to put me in a cage ain't no way to lock me 
 I done hopped out my grave but I ain't a zombie 
 My life so different and them boys knockin' 
 Bass beatin' bells ringing 
 And you can call it rockin' 
 (Chorus: canon)
