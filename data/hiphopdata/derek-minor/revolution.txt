 I am nothing like you rap guys 
 You should never get it confused 
 I don't fall for them cornball moves 
 You should work on your kung fu 
 Sensei how I kick game, even if they don't listen 
 Say your soul to 'em, if you want to your career be missing 
 Insult the culture vulture, RMG like cosanostra, mean we family 
 Murder everything, off of G.O.D, off of G.O.D 
 Learn from my losses 
 Started Amplify, now we fittin' to make everybody bosses 
 Y'all should be cautious 
 If you check 'cause I check the contract, don't look at me 
 'Cause that sell your dreams then buy 
 'Em back with your royalties, worries me 
 Went from robbing hood to Robin Hood 
 I can not complain 'cause Yah' is good 
 Even when they try to overlook 
 I can not complain 'cause Yah' is good

 Hey, shouts out Jimmy O 
 Hey, Kalley G. 
 Set aside like I been rapping for my good on these records 
 Hey what up Doc. Weezy that's my day one 
 Ton' we fittin' to turn up on this 
 Boy real quick you know what I'm saying 
 I've been trying hard to not look down on people I looked up to 
 I'm just trying to thrive and be a king like I'm supposed to 
 I've been cast out by people that called me brother 
 Now I murder everything you put me on like I'm Killmonger 
 Umm, whatever I got my things together 
 I don't sweat it even in hell with three sweaters 
 The flow frozen on a new level 
 I could build a snowman on the head of the devil, sheesh 
 Look what the game done done to me 
 I watch you get fat while I starved out with my team 
 But it taught us how to hunt, our aim is pristine 
 He invent us and sent all the fix-ins with my regime 
 Glory to God He give grace 
 He said before you get up finish your plate 
 So I tell the whole world I'm a sinner and Christ saves 
 I tell the whole world I'm a sinner and Christ saves 
 Still talking that talk, this my lane 
 You know, old dawgs, new tricks, I can't change 
 That a had you lookin' like you lost your brain 
 Everybody confused by my mission still the same 
 Get my family out the hood before I enter my grave 
 My mind, body, and soul, my faith in the name Jesus
