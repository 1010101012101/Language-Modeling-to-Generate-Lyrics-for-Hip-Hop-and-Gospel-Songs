 Sha. Have no idea why you're not picking up the phone at 3:30 in the morning right now but ... I'm sitting up here, I'm watching these infomercials, you know how I do man. I'm watching this infomercial for "Your Baby Can Read." Now these people are geniuses, right? They got little babies reading! Now listen. We gon' take that, remix it, scramble it up, and put it back out there for breakfast. Check me out. We comin' out with "Your Baby Can Rap." "Your Baby Can Rap." So we get the PRo verses, right, we get the PRo -
