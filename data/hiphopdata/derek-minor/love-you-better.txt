We first met my heart was beatin' like a drum set 
 You play guitar with my emotions is this love yes 
 You need a lead singer 
 Let me be yo front man 
 And put diamonds on yo finger girl 
 Now you got a rock band 
 It's done been a long day 
 Leave it up to me? 
 Turn my swag on Jackie Chan 
 Trynna sweep you off yo feet 
 Hiya! 
 Always there regardless of what I do 
 Now my life is camera shy 
 I can't picture it without you girl 
 (And girl you bad, you bad, you bad) 
 But I ain't got to tell you that 
 (Tell you that) 
 But I still do 
 (I still do) 
 And it's still true 
 (It's still true) 
 And we still here after all we been through 
 (We been through) 
 It's still me 
 And it's still you let's go 
 All I know is 
 You've been good to me 
 But I can love you better 
 I can love you better whoa 
 All I want is you for the rest of my life 
 But I can love you better 
 I can love you better baby 
 It goes rose, petals, Marvin Gaye 
 And yo favorite fragrans 
 Dining room candles lit lookin' like a s√©ance 
 Your boys out there's whippin 
 You ain't know I got that pot smokin' 
 Plus I got a bubble bath with yo name on it 
 You ain't got to worry 'bout a thing 
 I want our love first class 
 You bout to get an upgrade 
 Come fly with me 
 She ride or die with me (ride or die with me) 
 I know that 'cause when we was broke 
 That girl survived with me 
 Yeah, I swear to God on that alter 
 My love for You will never falter 
 And I plan on keepin' that promise forever 
 We going higher today girl I'm a love you better 
 Yeah I'm a love you better 
 And I'm a treat you better babe 
 Cause you got my last name yeah 
 And I'm a love you better 
 So I'm a love you better baby yeah
