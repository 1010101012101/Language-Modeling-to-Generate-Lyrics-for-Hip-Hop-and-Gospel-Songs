You were made for greatness 
 You were made for greatness baby 
 You were made for greatness 
 And don't you let them tell you nothing else 
 Reporting to you live from the gutter 
 Where the news say we only wanna kill each other 
 I done heard all the cries from our mothers 
 They still praying for the lives of our brothers yea 
 Some feel we worthless, I think that's a lie 
 Misunderstood like rocket science but that's the reason we fly 
 The world is broken I know it, I believe God the mechanic 
 We are tools to change it all, he even uses the ratchet 
 Some of my dogs climbing mountains of burdens 
 So they get high trying to reach the pinnacle of purpose 
 I know geniuses that died in the streets 
 They was deaf to they purpose, they was moving them keys, they Beethoven 
 Praying for wealth to deliver us 
 But Even if your chains are gold, you still a prisoner 
 Stuck in the darkness and still waiting on the risen Son 
 A bunch of kings and we don't know that it's a throne for us 
 You were made for greatness 
 You were made for greatness baby 
 You were made for greatness 
 And don't you let them tell you nothing else 
 I know how it is to take a loss, they ain't see your passion 
 And every year they write you off, I can tell you that's taxing 
 Kill your dreams and it haunt you, makes it very hard to sleep 
 But the benefit of that is I'm awake now 
 Can't tell you how Many times I thought to call it quits 
 I'm only hear cause God been on my side through all of this 
 I'm only hear cause RMG and all my dogs in this 
 My friends and family hold me up, won't let me fall in this 
 Please believe 
 From the inception of my purpose, it's been bigger than me 
 Christopher Nolan can't direct our dreams 
 Don't understand why anybody would wanna stop us 
 We trying to bring flavor to the table like a potluck 
 I'm rambling, before you get to hating 
 Before my verse end, I'll go ahead and sum it up like calculators 
 You are here for more, there's a purpose on the trail that your blazing 
 I know it's amazing 
 Reflect God, Reflect Greatness 
 You were made for greatness 
 You were made for greatness baby 
 You were made for greatness 
 And don't you let them tell you nothing else
