Who you know shining in these streets like a light mane 
 Who you know stay the same Sunday to Sunday 
 Who you know taking off on tracks like a runway 
 Who you know beat the odds even when they say he can't 
 Who you know 
 Who you know 
 Who you know 
 Who you know 
 Who you know 
 Who you know 
 Who you know 
 Who you know that hop on tracks and act like he done lost his mind 
 Who you know that love The Lord and ain't gone trip if you don't like 
 Who you know that's RMG but unashamed until he die 
 Who you know that talk bout God and still out rap your trappest guy 
 Who do you know that could careless about how much money you making 
 Cause that don't impress him 
 Who do you know that know he ain't supposed to be here 
 So tomorrow he counting his blessings 
 Who do you know that's gone steer clear of people that stay in some drama 
 'Cause they looking messy 
 Who do you know gone keep real in the message 
 Who you know 
 Who you know 
 Who you know

 People gone say that I'm crazy 
 I stepped out on my own, on a plane with no parachute 
 Turbulence it will not phase me 
 Float right over problems inside my hot air balloon 
 You know what I been on (know what I been on) 
 That ain't gone change whether suburb or ghetto 
 Faith what I live on (faith what I live on) 
 Full speed ahead boy it's pedal to metal now 
 Who you know

 I hear a whole lot of talking. Sit back and listen 
 Why you make so many assumptions (so many assumptions) 
 Soon as they hear that you Christian 
 Like bet that he all about money 
 I bet he only rock gators and suits on a Sunday 
 I bet that he think that he perfect 
 I don't see nothing but hypocrites all in them churches 
 Y'all lying. Holla at Canon. You'll see that he is who he say he is 
 Tone or Chad Jones 
 You gone see fathers that's off in they home and they living it 
 Deraj and B Coop, bout dat life 
 Lecrae 116 bout dat life 
 You think this way more than music, hwah, you guessed it you right 
 I wrote this for every person, know that we not perfect 
 But through Jesus purchase, we gone keep on working 
 Fakin we allergic, on our grind till the wheels, wheels, wheels fall off (till the wheels fall off) 
 It's all about Jesus. He got a people that he been redeeming 
 The world is so tired of the fake so they look for the real they ask you these questions like 
 Who you know
