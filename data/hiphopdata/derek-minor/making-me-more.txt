I'm cruising down the back road tryn'a let my soul take flight 
 Time, time will tell if I'm ever Going to learn to live right 
 Preacher man tells me seek and you will find 
 Well the Lord God Almighty ain't gonna let me in O' no not tonight 
 Hey I've been running like Forest Gump, but not through Frank Oceans mind 
 My futures out in front of me this life behind 
 You think I got it all get a pretty little penny from show to show 
 New York Jet Rex Ryan goes! 
 Uh, Look Many think I'm superman all my music heaven sent 
 But look under this cape you find out these Angel wings are clipped 
 Pray for Minorville A city under fire Not so incredible Hulk 
 Derek Minor Yeah! 
 Oh that's enough just because I'm alive doesn't mean I've ever lived 
 Well I'm sorry to say it but I wish I can trade this all and start again 
 I'm hoping that your making me more [x3] 
 I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, um o yeah deceiver 
 And at times I'm Q-Tip, I got thoughts of Bonita! 
 Wait get a grip there you go In your mind wander in front of these folks again 
 Some don't want the truth 'Cause when I tell 'em taste and see 
 They just wanna skip the meal and eat these fortune cookie tweets 
 But the LORD see's the game from the pressbox 
 And he seek where we hide in our best spot 
 And the evil that he finds when he looks at me 
 Make me wanna look and sound like an X-box 
 I know some say Halloween they never celebrate 
 But wear a different costume almost every single day 
 That's why Jesus Christ died the most scariest of fates 
 So the monsters and the goblins can throw their mask away Yeah! 
 Oh that's enough just because I'm alive doesn't mean I've ever lived 
 Well I'm sorry to say it but I wish I can trade this all and start again 
 I'm hoping that your making me more 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 Oh Oh Oh Oh 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 Oh that's enough just because I'm alive doesn't mean I've ever lived 
 Well I'm sorry to say it but I wish I can trade this all and start again 
 I'm hoping that your making me more 
 Oh Oh Oh...
