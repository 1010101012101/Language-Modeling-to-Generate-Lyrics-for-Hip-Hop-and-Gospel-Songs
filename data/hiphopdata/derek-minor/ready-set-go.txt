 Ok, put me in your ear buds 
 Me and Dirty use your cerebellum like a kick drum 
 Give me a scalpel, I'ma brain surgeon this time 
 In other words, I'ma 'bout to open up your mind 
 Light of the world, I say Amen to that 
 'Cause every time I hit a track 
 I put fire on wax 
 Aye, you lookin' kinda hungry 
 I can help you with that 
 Boy, my flow, your rows, meetin' these raps 
 Aye, you look at me thinkin' I made it 
 I look up and say it's God's grace and we come from places where you see faces 
 No barber shop, somehow they faded 
 Why do I need to worry about what you thinkin' 
 We ain't even supposed to be in these spaces 
 Drop to the fed, we celebrated 
 3, 2, 1 everybody go crazy 
 Wait 
 I'ma call my brothers in the A 
 I'ma call my brothers in the H 
 Tampa Bay, NYC, Californ, IA, MIA 
 Or 
 Dallas, Orlando, St. Louie, and my my people is with me 
 Tennessee my home 
 It don't matter what city I tell 'em 
 Ready, Set, Go 
 1:16 in the fast lane 
 Catch me if you can 
 Catch me if you can 
 Catch me if you can

 116 my logo 
 RMG my photo 
 Try to do us wrong, but they come up short as Frodo 
 Turn my music on, have them bouncin' like Pogo 
 But it's always one hater out here lookin' like Bozo 
 You know when I get on this microphone 
 I say Jesus took away 
 When I spit upon, my gorilla form 
 And my riddle form 
 Inside the Church of big reform 
 Believe when I talk about God 
 It's nothing like corn-on-the-cob, or Wizard of Oz 
 It's realer than most of the killin' 'n' pimpin' and most of you say what you spit in your bars 
 Instead of Christian Rapper, you should call me Trill Rapper 
 I'ma tha boy that's puttin' on from the veil rapper 
 I'ma put me in a circle of some ill rappers 
 And now I brag about God, then kill rappers 
 Whoops, back to the subject 
 You ain't heard Mayweather beatin' on your subs yet 
 Whoopin' on this beat, boy, and I ain't got no gloves yet 
 We havin' fun yet 
 Ready, Set, Go 
 1:16 in the fast lane 
 Catch me if you can 
 Catch me if you can 
 Catch me if you can
