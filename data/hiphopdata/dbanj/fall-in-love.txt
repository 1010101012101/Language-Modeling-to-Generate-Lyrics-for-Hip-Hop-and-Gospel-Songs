Don't get it twisted, love is a beautiful thing 
 It's Don Jazzy again 
 I'm Dbanj 
 When Koko master fall in love 
 You know say water don pass gari 
 I'm in love, are you in love? 
 Omo, you don make me fall in love 
 Fall in love o (2x) 
 We suppose marry because you don make me fall in love 
 Fall in love o (2x) 
 My sweet potato 
 I want to tell you my mind, want to tell you my mind o 
 I no understand o 
 'Cause I dey see well well when they say love is blind o 
 You see as you dey so 
 You are the love of my life, you are the love of my life o 
 I cannot deny o 
 I want to make you my wife, want to make you wife o 
 See, I never thought that I will find someone like you 
 That will capture my heart and there's nothing I can do 
 I used to brag to my friends that I will always be a player 
 But since I set my eyes on you 
 My sugar banana 
 As I don get you ebe say I make hammer 
 Me, I no fit wait o 
 Make you come follow me make we go see my mama 
 For better for worse o 
 We go dey together in any kind of weather 
 See I no dey joke o 
 Say na true I dey talk o, na true I dey talk o 
 My friends dey ask me say 
 Oboy, what is the matter? 
 Me I dey tell them say 
 You dey make my head scatter 
 See I used to lie to myself that I'll always be a player 
 But since I set my eyes on you
