Hhm... Hhm. 
 I told you before 
 Listen 
 I'm dbanj 
 Hhm... Hhm... 
 Oshe... 
 Mogbe... 
 Baby tell me what's your name 
 Tell me what's your number 
 Is it me or something else? 
 Because your bakasy na thunder 
 You're driving me insane 
 You mess with my medulla... 
 I no go let you go in vain. 
 And wen I catch you na forever 
 Emergency, emergency, you never see me coming through (4ce) 
 Gbangba robo robo robo rabo (4ce) 
 Baby come to the floor (2ce) 
 Baby show too the floor (2ce) 
 Baby tell me what to do 
 I've been here since to two 
 Now l'm talking now, I'm confused 
 From your back, you look like toolz 
 Oya o Oya o... 
 Iwo lomo towari o... 
 Ode dira modi me o... 
 Sugbon moti cover bukata ye o... 
 Emergency, emergency, you never see coming through (4ce) 
 Gbangba robo robo robo rabo 
 Baby come to the floor (2ce) 
 Baby show to the floor (2ce) 
 Emergency, emergency, you never see me coming through (4ce) 
 Baby come to the floor (2ce) 
 Baby show to the floor (2ce) 
 Gbangba robo robo robo rabo
