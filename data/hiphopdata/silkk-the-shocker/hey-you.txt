Yeah, yeah, hold up, hold up, hold up 
 I don't think this nigga understand 
 I'ma take this back to the old Silkk, nigga, yeah 
 Yeah, dirty nigga, uh huh, uh huh, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Hey you, yeah you, nigga whatchu lookin' at? 
 Hey you, yeah you, nigga whatchu lookin' at? 
 Hey you, yeah you, nigga whatchu lookin' at? 
 Keep muggin' and frontin', gonna get your face pushed back 
 You don't want me lookin', you shouldn't bring her up in here 
 You don't want no problem, you shouldn't be lookin' over here 
 You don't want me lookin', you shouldn't bring her up in here 
 You don't want no problem, you shouldn't be lookin' over here 
 Even his own boy is like, "Nah, don't fuck with Slim" 
 Anybody else could spit, "Please, don't fuck with him" 
 They know once I go there, it be hard for me to come back 
 Put you in a place where it be hard for you to come back 
 I keep it straight gangsta look, I don't talk money 
 If I bust nigga, he don't die, he survive, he gonna walk funny 
 Look, let's box, let's talk about that 
 But you don't wanna be gangsta, you don't talk about gats 
 But if you got gangsta and I ain't talking 'bout a rat 
 So, when I put something on your mind, I ain't talking 'bout a hat 
 These jealous niggaz can't stand me, they hate me 
 If I ever clap a nigga, it wouldn't be to give 'em a standing ovation 
 Niggaz mad 'cause my, 'cause my wrist stay frozen 
 I'm straight 'cause I done seen more weight than Gold Gym 
 Everybody is strict, respecting no slim 
 But he must not so somebody in this bitch should've told him 
 Hey you, yeah you, nigga whatchu lookin' at? 
 Hey you, yeah you, nigga whatchu lookin' at? 
 Hey you, yeah you, nigga whatchu lookin' at? 
 Keep muggin' and frontin', gonna get your face pushed back 
 You don't want me lookin', you shouldn't bring her up in here 
 You don't want no problem, you shouldn't be lookin' over here 
 You don't want me lookin', you shouldn't bring her up in here 
 You don't want no problem, you shouldn't be lookin' over here 
 Like one nigga, two nigga, three nigga, four 
 When I pull this thang out, everybody better get low 
 Or if not, then their clothes shake like a barber 
 Whoever who still standing, lay 'em down like carpet 
 These fake dudes, always wanna talk hood 
 He ain't real, he ain't gangsta, he just really talk good 
 And that getchu, put up on a stretcher 
 For pullin' it out, trying to mob like you was Claudia Shepard 
 See my motto is, 'I won't pull it out unless I use it' 
 So, if you heard I pulled it out, no doubt you heard I used it 
 If a niggaz step to me, then you know that he stupid 
 'Cause a real nigga live this whodi, this just not music 
 Hey you, yeah you, nigga whatchu lookin' at? 
 Hey you, yeah you, nigga whatchu lookin' at? 
 Hey you, yeah you, nigga whatchu lookin' at? 
 Keep muggin' and frontin', gonna get your face pushed back 
 You don't want me lookin', you shouldn't bring her up in here 
 You don't want no problem, you shouldn't be lookin' over here 
 You don't want me lookin', you shouldn't bring her up in here 
 You don't want no problem, you shouldn't be lookin' over here 
 I know this bitch ain't lookin' at me 
 Hey you, yeah you, bitch whatchu lookin' at? 
 Hey you, yeah you, bitch whatchu lookin' at? Yeah you 
 Nigga whatchu lookin' at?
