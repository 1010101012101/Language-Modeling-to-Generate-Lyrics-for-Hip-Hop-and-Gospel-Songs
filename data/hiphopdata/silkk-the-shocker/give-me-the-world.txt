Silkk the shocker lyrics 
 "Give Me The World" 
 Yo, god father I come today to ask you a favor 
 Young Silkk I've always liked you, today before we make 
 You a made nigga just tell me a little more about yourself 
 (Silkk) 
 My life started FUCKED up got me lost in the game they 
 Told me I was never going amount to nothing so started 
 Slanging some cane you could love or hate it nigga wanna 
 See Silkk incarserated they complicated, contomplated that's why 
 I can't be faded I hate it they sucked up they mad that I made it 
 Young Silkk overated keep my dope overweighted (?) mercedes respect 
 With a nigga like I smash hand on four five surrounded by killers and 
 Soldiers and bullet proof glass mob representing linger soldiers kiss 
 My pinky finger my balls camoflauged by this rap singin' drug dealing 
 Made me famous so I'm going to keep on doin' it got used to it the whole 
 World united for me 
 Give me the World 
 I want everything from dollars to cream 
 Give me the World 
 Large amounts of money the American dream 
 Give me the World 
 High class pussy expensive cars 
 Give me the World 
 Finer foods and cuban cigars 
 Give me the World 
 Money and power it's my only plan 
 Give me the World 
 I won't rest till the world's in my hand 
 Lo ciento mucho, FUCK THAT you came short on my dope cut off one of 
 Your fingers send it in the mail you'll have my money by twelve send 
 The other four the game designed by me so I can't lose I make if they 
 Don't give me what I want I make them an offer they can't refuse 
 I pay dues gave a small time for lent I stay in dirt like grass you'll 
 Never find my fucking finger prints don't lie snitches in this game 
 Niggas see men's shoes Floretin is everything can't break the rules 
 See me kinda man lost a ki of some cane but I can't cry over spilled 
 Milk have to charge it to the game invested large in vegas I roll with 
 Top notch (?) driving jet planes sittin' on yachts all I wanna do is 
 Represent (represent) should I say all I wanna get (do) is presidents 
 Give me the World 
 I want everything from dollars to cream 
 Give me the World 
 Large amounts of money the American dream 
 Give me the World 
 High class pussy expensive cars 
 Give me the World 
 Finer foods and cuban cigars 
 Give me the World 
 Money and power it's my only plan 
 Give me the World 
 I won't rest till the world's in my hand 
 Give me the World 
 Money and power it's my only plan 
 Give me the World 
 I won't rest till the world's in my hand
