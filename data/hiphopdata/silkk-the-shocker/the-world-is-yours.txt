 It's okay it's okay. Don Vito.(It's on now) 
 It's rules to 'dis (It's rules to 'dis) but you can't break none of 'em.(None of 'em) 
 All we got on the street is ours balls and our word.(That's it. That's it.) 
 Yo it's rules to this shit 
 And you can't break none of 'em (none of 'em) 
 It'll cost you nigga 
 So you can't break one of 'em (one of 'em) 
 Never get high 
 On your own supply 
 Never stunt, never get front nigga 
 More than you can buy 
 If a nigga's down on his luck 
 Never fuck wit him right? 
 If a nigga rollin' 
 Never fuck wit a nigga dice 
 Nigga ain't fuck wit you 
 Never fuck wit a nigga life 
 No matter how good she look 
 Never fuck wit a nigga wife 
 If a deal go down 
 Then get the chrome 
 Never look suspicious when the switch is on 
 If you think you're tapped up 
 Then switch your phone 
 Think a nigga watchin' your house 
 Then switch your home 
 Always check your money 
 In case the shit gets off 
 You bought into it, know what you gotta do female 
 Dish it off 
 Never talk back 
 Gotta respect the boss 
 Never leave witnesses (beepbeepbeepbeep) 
 Gotta check the pulse 
 The world is yours if you follow the rules and play by it 
 All you got is balls and words, now stay by it 
 The streets of rap is still do or die 
 No matter where the fuck you at, the same rules apply 
 The world is yours if you follow the rules and play by it 
 All you got is your balls and words, you gotta stay by it 
 The streets of rap is still do or die

 I done fucked wit killers in the south 
 East and west niggas hard 
 Fucked wit dealers in the north 
 The rest is broad 
 Every now and then you might catch me sexin' a star 
 Ain't no fault the only person I trust is 
 My guns and guard 
 We ghetto D.O. nigga and bounce to dat 
 All my rap sales and crack sale couldn't amount to dat 
 If I get caught wit more than a ounce of crack 
 I plead, take a three then I bounce right back 
 Niggas can't wait to take my place (place) 
 Niggas can't wait till I make a mistake 
 That's why I spin it all 
 'Cause I know I can't take it wit me 
 Some jealous motherfuckers out there can't wait to get me (Ah!) 
 That's why I check that nigga 
 If I don't feel that nigga 
 I'm like "Dude, that's my dog, 
 How you can't be real wit a nigga? 
 How you gonna steal from me nigga? 
 See niggas will drill you nigga" 
 (But boss that's gonna cost) 
 Well, bill me nigga 
 Look, nigga 
 I'm a bad dude, shit, body full of tattoos 
 Type of nigga that your family don't want you hangin' round 
 'Cause I'm bad news 
 Drop the hot shit, so I cock shit...
