 Dear God can ya save me 
 If you can't save me, save our babies 
 (We tryin' to keep it real, so many ghetto tears my people cry 
 Life is hard and I see that every day, just so many ghetto tears 
 In the ghetto)

 : 
 Age 11 lookin' out of a ghetto buildin' 
 Mom and 5 of us little ghetto children 
 I ain't never knew wrong from right 
 Growin' up all my life, thinkin' Adidas had 4 stripes 
 See my uncle tried to warn us 
 Told us never to do drugs, and yesterday I saw him on it 
 See in my hood it ain't no love 
 Age 13 seen my auntie O.D. on drugs 
 The neighborhood hoe only 15 and everybody wants to bang her 
 Found her dead, gave herself an abortion with a clothes hanger 
 I seen one of my neighbors try everything but couldn't make it 
 Came home one day killed his whole family I guess he couldn't take it 
 I give back, even if it ain't nothin' big 
 Look at my grandma, terminal disease only got months to live 
 They tell us we ain't gonna be nothin', gave my homie 25 years 
 I shed tears for all my peers

 Dear God can ya save me 
 If you can't save me save our babies 
 So many ghetto tears my people cry 
 You ain't supposed to question God but I'm asking why 
 So many ghetto tears my people cry 
 Throughout the years, my people shed ghetto tears 
 My people shed ghetto tears 
 Throughout the years

 The ghetto's like a headache, one big ol' migraine 
 Tryin' to stay high till I die, tryin' to like hide the pain 
 My homie mama died and didn't know it 
 When she died he committed suicide my homie jumped up off the sixth floor 
 Maybe it's too late for me since I'm still here, I'm kinda glad to be 
 Been in and out of jail since I was 12, life been hectic since mama had me 
 I have to ask myself the simple question why 
 It's so hard to live but yet so easy to die 
 With this simple question Lord can you help me 
 Just tryin' to live large and wealthy from these card that you dealt me 
 I used to ask my uncles for money, but now they ask me 
 Life passed 'em up, I wonder will life pass me 
 'Cause see it, really ain't no love for us ghetto kids 
 For all the dirt that I did I don't think I'll find where heaven is 
 I wonder why they won't panic and try to ban it 
 Probably 'cause they scared of me or just don't understand me

 How could you carry a kid for 9 months black 
 She had a baby boy but while she she was pregnant she was smokin' crack 
 How could you rape and abuse your kids 
 How could you commit incest and say you love your kids 
 They ain't ask to be here, they ain't ask to see here 
 Slipped here by 15 minutes of pleasure, that's why they can't see clear 
 From the cradle to the grave or from the elementary to the penitentiary 
 Life is so hard now bet ya leave it
