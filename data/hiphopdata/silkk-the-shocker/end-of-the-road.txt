(Silkk) 
 ?? How I miss my homies so 
 I don't expect y'all to understand this 
 Cause y'all ain't never lost nobody 
 But imagine the closest person to you 
 See everybody feel it 
 But some of us 
 Feel it more than the rest 
 Just think about it 
 It only add 
 More to the stress 
 I try to live my life day by day 
 And ignore the rest 
 It's so FUCKED UP 
 I can feel life 
 More than I feel death 
 Split second 
 And picture 
 The family's being torn 
 I gotta tell my little nephew 
 His dad wasn't around 
 To see him being born 
 When we get older 
 Playing with our kids 
 He just sittin' all alone 
 You know what his last birthday wish was 
 He wishes daddy come home 
 And while I'm at the funeral 
 Contemplating sittin' in strap 
 He looked up to me 
 Gave me a hug and asked me 
 "Silkk, where my daddy at?" 
 Question I couldn't answer 
 Tell him a vacation 
 And somehow I wish 
 If I tell him this enough 
 Maybe one day 
 He just might forget 
 I guess I'll be seeing you 
 At the end of the road (end of the road, I'll see y'all there) 
 You know it ain't easy 
 Lettin' my homie go (end of the road, I'll see y'all there
