Ah! I kicks it off, n**** what rhyme wit no f***in problem, 
 Down wit them drama boys, an also Eightball, 
 Understand I gotta plan, to get me some green, 
 I stay in cruise like control, but busters fold like a bad poker hand, 
 Now watch me shake this b**** up, like the dice games, 
 See I'm always schemin; tryin'; to get over n****z like left an right lanes, 
 Different day same s***, I ain't playin' b****, 
 N****z still got a rusty four-five wit the same clip, an see, 
 You can get wit this, or you can get wit that, 
 You probably won't get wit this click, 'cause um, this where the gangsters at, 
 It's a real deal b****, the real s***, there's no gimmicks, 
 Suave House, an the 504 Boys courtesy of No Limit, hit 'em up. 
 Get down, feel the ground, shake 'em up, you down to die, 
 'Cause we too much for the industry to handle, we buck aside, 
 Run it n**** nut wit yo five, 
 I like to lease s*** it's gettin' lethal an I, 
 You know the drama boys, down fo life the Suave an I, to the dirt, 
 Drama boys, wit Ball got drama that will work, 
 Make 'em feel it, every land we hit it from sugar to shy, 
 Adrenaline pumpin, ready to ride, gotta get my guys, 
 Can't waste no time, it's first of my life an money, 
 Now watch drama get bloody bloody, in ???, 
 Gotta let you know that it's a cuttin' up, 
 An if you don't hundred guys, hundred girls gonna make you wish you hadn't stuttered. 
 Slow down, they see me an say, THAT'S HIM, 
 That's that bastard, 
 An as soon as you start runnin' up like it's hurtin' ya, 
 It's when I f*** ya fasta, 
 Don't really want to be like that, but I tell this b**** I be if I have to, 
 Shut this motha f***a down, bend it backwards, 
 Y'all already know where we at this is Suave House, it's like my house, 
 An if you ain't down with the an No Limit, then ride out, 
 Y'all hypin' died down, its baskin' an dried out, 
 Sparks poppin' from the ground it's comin' out my mouth, 
 B**** don't get mad, go get yo bags an roll wit it, 
 Or stay the f*** away from n****z you got no business, 
 We don't give a f*** about nothin', we untouched, 
 One-hundred percent pure s***, uncut. 
 Suave House, No Limit soldiers (x8) 
 Real playaz, 
 Wit nothin' but this uncut, 
 (Master P) 
 Down south fake hataz get tossed up. 
 (Eightball) 
 Ain't No Limit to the Suaveness, we bust, 
 World wide wit this pure uncut. UGHH! 
 Verse 4-(Pysde) 
 Here goes this potioness vocaless, 
 Wit the motion of locus, 
 An leavin' 'em, open an dope, wit there noses drove when I focus, 
 The de-infected brain cells, lay by the thousands, 
 The music them hittin shown to be known to livin' in project housin, 
 Towels that ring-out, givin' up on why'all boy, 
 Why'all don't need to be f***in wit moi boy, 
 No Limit an Suave boy or I boy, 
 You suckaz hear till you make you feel me deeper than you, 
 Some of these b****ez as cold as a Chicago at christmas an this is, 
 A test to make 'em scroll from a brain of the ???, 
 Ignorant mutha f***az that will get high an talk from ???, 
 Inflict the sickness yeah for the paper, guess who after me, 
 The Don limited an the fat mack gonna cut it after me. 
 Verse 5-(Master P) 
 UGHHH! Chasin houses ride wit me, 
 Real n****z an b****es get high wit me, 
 I live the life of a No Limit soldier, 
 I run wit pimps an dealaz, I thought I told ya, 
 But we all about our piz-aper, 
 That's why I jumped in the double O an hooked up wit Tony Draper, 
 So handle bizze at the biz-house, 
 It's all about No Limit an that... Suave House, 
 Gettin' paid for the diz-ounds, 
 Worth millions 'cause we all about our piz-ounds, 
 So how ya do dat there, make 'em say UGH!, 
 Get rowdy, get 'bout it. 
 Verse 6-(Eightball) 
 Who is it? Big Ball payin' a visit, 
 Don't miss my exhibit, n**** I'm about to rip it, apart, 
 Startin wit yo heart, we ain't hard s***, 
 Dirty ass street n****, stained an the scarin s***, 
 An foreign s***, most hoes would kill to get wit, 
 The Suave House, an them soldiers at No Limit, 
 N****z fear it 'cause we strong an we black on, 
 Green or brown, we be smokin' till the sack gone, 
 Tornados flows, blow away my foes, 
 Hurracaine came, stormin on these hoes, 
 Master P, Silkk, Mystikal an Psycho Drama, 
 In the kitchen wit me cookin up this uncut. 
 (Chorus Eightball an Master P's x2) 
 (Suave House, No Limit soldiers x16)
