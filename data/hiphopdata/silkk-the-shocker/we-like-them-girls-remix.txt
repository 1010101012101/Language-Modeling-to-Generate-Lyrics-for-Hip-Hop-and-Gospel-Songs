(Silkk The Shocker) 
 Ya boy Shocker in the building 
 Heads remain anonymous 
 He ain't gotta be obvoious 
 Ladies, if y'all thirsty, drinks on me 
 And you fake ballers, you know what to do 
 Girls, we like dem girls 
 We gotta have dem girls 
 We like dem girls, girls, girls, girls 
 (Master P (Silkk The Shocker)) 
 And all y'all haters 
 Be gone want want want 
 Be gone want want want 
 Be gone want want want be gone 
 You get money (then take it to the floor) New No Limits 
 You got game (then take it to the floor) Silkk, Master P 
 You ain't scared (then take it to the floor) Petey Pablo 
 You came to the party (then take it to the floor) Mike Diesel on the beat 
 (Silkk The Shocker) 
 Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God 
 I don't know but last night seemed kinda odd 
 The spot was hot, the place was packed 
 They had fat asses wall to wall and back to back 
 Imagine that, it was a hell of a scene 
 Either that or it was a hell of a dream, ya heard me 
 They had a few ballers but not that many 
 Alot of model-type chicks but not that skinny 
 I mean one in aticular caught my eye 
 I mean she gave me a look when I walked by 
 Like "yeah we about to have fun here" 
 Her mouth ain't move but her body sayin' come here 
 Want want want so I passed the key 
 And got a hotel suite like Cassidy 
 And Kel, so I yell let's blaze the party 
 And something started up and it sounded like Atari 
 Shorty tell me what your name is? 
 Drea tell me what your game is? 
 Shorty tell me why you came here? 
 Drea show me what ya working with? 
 (Chorus: Master P) 
 Girls, we like dem girls 
 We gotta have them girls 
 We like dem girls, girls, girls, girls 
 Girls we like dem girls 
 We gotta have them girls 
 We like dem girls, girls, girls, girls 
 (Petey Pablo) 
 Now the hardest decision I gotta make 
 Which girl am I humping today? 
 Petey Pablo done jumped back in the game 
 Got the world freek-a-leakin like they insane 
 Lifting their skirts, showing me thangs 
 Lifting their shirts, letting them hang 
 How they made they booty bounce to a beat these days 
 It's like Luther Vandross song "So Amazing" 
 Ugh, ugh, ugh ain't that crazy 
 Hey Silkk I think I got something on my hand 
 This girl wilder than the Taliban 
 I'ma bout leave here, take her to a lion's gate 
 On the back floor, I'm a jury mate 
 Don't worry 'bout the room, I got maids 
 Ain't price any cheaper, I got paper 
 (Silkk the Shocker) 
 See me and these boys came to act a fool 
 The New No Limit, we don't play by the rules 
 I came to party, not to clap the game 
 Get C out of jail 'cause it's time to get paid 
 Up and down and I ain't talking bout waves 
 I'm in the Bently getting my head done and I ain't talking bout braids 
 (Master P) 
 I'm country mayne, I'll punch ya brain 
 I'll roll wit boys that'll pluck ya mayne 
 You get money, you better tuck ya mayne 
 The haters out here, they'll cut ya mayne 
 Get loose with it, stay true with it 
 We don't want it if you let Bruce Bruce hit it 
 Get loose with it, stay true with it 
 We don't want it if you let bruce bruce hit it 
 Her neck, her back 
 We can fix it in my Lac 
 Her neck, her back 
 We can fix it in my Lac 
 (Silkk Over Chorus) 
 Shorty I'ma get with you 
 But like Chingy I'm only one call away 
 I mean I'ma baller take that away 
 I'll call you heh
