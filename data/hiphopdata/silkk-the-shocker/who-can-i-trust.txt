Silkk the shocker lyrics 
 "Who Can I Trust" 
 Yeah, I let you in to the organization 
 (Fucking organization) 
 I thought you could be trusted 
 (I thought you could be fucking trusted) 
 You could have had anything 
 (You could have had anything) 
 How could you betray the family 
 Loyalty is everything 
 (Every fucking thing) 
 You broke the rules 
 (You broke the fucking rules) 
 It's a code we live by 
 There's no turning back now 
 (Welcome to this fucking piece of shit) 
 Who can you trust to watch your back 
 Who can you trust when the enemy comes strapped 
 Who can I trust in this time of greed 
 Who can I trust to look out for me (hey) 
 (Silkk the Shocker) 
 How could ya, when you did it you lost me 
 I would of gave you the world so how could you cross me 
 I break bread with my TRU on watch my friends and foes 
 Toast hennesy trust nobody keep my enemies close 
 Now all the time I just wanted wanted to be free 
 And all the time I tried to help you just wanted to be me 
 Sometimes I just wanna take clips and go to war all on my own 
 Trusting my TRU niggas and my TRU brothers and I don't wanna 
 Got tat on my own now if it was mine it was yours if I had it 
 You had it you told me watch my front you gone watch my back 
 I did that you stabbed me nigga be snitchin' to the cops 
 Send me to the penitentiary even if its packed 
 But just mention me to my enemies the ones that stabbed me in the back 
 I wonder who can I trust when I out bustin' blastin' my guns 
 I wonder who can I trust to hop when I'm on the run 
 I wonder who can I trust to hold my last piece of stash 
 I wonder who can I trust to hang with my best piece of ass 
 I knew it was fate by the day when I looked in his eyes 
 I get beside love is trust some nigga came by 
 I heard he workin' with them people nigga kicked in my door 
 Got me facin' all kinds fucked up charges got me sittin' in court 
 (Everybody rise) 
 Take my last stand it's my last chance but take that warrant to my last dance 
 Before they sentence me I through 'em in the court room and hollered 
 (Its ok) Looked 'em in his eyes and wispered you're a coward 
 (People talking) 
 D.E.A. boy (freeze get on the fucking ground and don't move) 
 What part of the game is this 
 Part of the game where the fat lady sings boy it's over for you 
 I'm just sittin' here tryin' to make money 
 Not no 'mo that shits over charge it to the game 
 How the fuck y'all found out who told y'all 
 It was your homey partner 
 (Silkk) 
 Who can you trust (haha) Who can you trust 
 Rest in piece Biggie rest in piece Pac 
 Who can you trust
