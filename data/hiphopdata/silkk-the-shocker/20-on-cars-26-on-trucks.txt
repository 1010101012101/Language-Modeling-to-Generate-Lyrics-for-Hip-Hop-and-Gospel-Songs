Chill 
 We ridin' 20s on the cars and 26s on the trucks 
 And everybody diggin us it ain't no limit to the bucks 
 We makin' noise in the game to let 'em know we comin' up 
 And haters movin out the way they know they don't wanna play wit us 
 We ridin' (Chill) how I spit 'em man 
 Pockets holdin' 50 gram 
 Ridin' big body Impala man me and my partners man 
 20 inch rims keep 'em spinnin like a ceilin fan 
 Haters gold tending tryin' to get me out my figures man 
 But they can't get the man (no) can't hit the man (no) 
 Even them NBA dudes can't stick the man 
 Women crowd around me paparazzi takin' pictures man 
 Catch me on the line at 3-1-0 I'm fixin to get 'em man 
 Curren$y got plenty money to stack up 
 Play with me or my crew and we'll be pickin' them gats up 
 And plenty burners too in case you dudes wanna act up 
 And have you on yo cellie callin homies for back up 
 And I don't think you really want it to come this 
 Something for that growl whodi you betta shut ya trap 
 But I ain't really comin' huntin for no drama 
 I just wana hit the club and leave with yo baby mama 
 We ridin' 20s on the Bentley 26s on the Lac truck 
 If the cop will stop me I'm probly gone get hacked up 
 'Cause I'm underage but never underpaid 
 I'm makin' maximum wages richie rich I got it made 
 They call me Romeo big game plenty dough 
 You can't hold me so let me go I got talent and that's for show 
 Ask about the kid and they'll tell you that dude can flow 
 And when I'm done with school I be hoopin up in the pros Whoa 
 No Limit boys we big rimmin our cars up 
 Tearin malls up spendin thousands at Toys are Us 
 Nobody else who's in the game go as hard as us 
 There's no one as large as us, you don't wanna start with us 
 I know more about kids than grown women 
 Every week they watchin my show on television 
 They gotta love me they know the boys winnin' 
 The girlies keep grinnin my rims they keep spinnin 
 I'm a tell ya like this keep ya eyes on your chick 
 'Cause her eyes on my wrist and these boys that I'm with 
 The girls like me whodi I don't blame em 
 I'm in the Guinness Book of Records for the richest entertainer 
 Call me the ghetto Bill Gates 'cause the system can't change us 
 Had money and cars way before I was famous 
 I'm in the pros but I could buy the the team 
 I got two made buys one blue the other green 
 If it ain't ridin' spinnas then you know I can't roll it 
 And if I had it over a month then I let my cousin hold it 
 I'm the first one on Cribs with a house with gold ceilings 
 Gotta truck load of Bentleys 'cause that's how I'm livin' 
 In the winter pull the trucks out 
 The summer it's the drop top 
 P Miller on my clothes (whoa) got a million in the watch 
 Hey move out the way I'm ready to cause havoc 
 Me and my soldiers be ballin why must be yo actin' 
 I leave cats distractin stickin like magnets 
 I'm the shorty from the Philippines the main attraction 
 Rollin' up in fly whips switchin every other day 
 No Limit girls ball like the WNBA 
 We ridin' chill
