 Shake it girl, work it girl 
 Us thugs, we like them girlz 
 Little mama wit alla that (Hey) 
 Let me tell you where the partys at (ooh ooh) 
 No Limits where the ballas at (over here) 
 We pop bottles like we quarterbacks 
 Hey girl won't you do that dance 
 Lookin' good mami, won't you shake that thing 
 I like your style and the way you move 
 You make a thug wanna get wit you 
 [Silkk] 
 When I come through Dawg you no I'm fly 
 [Master P] It's about to jump off 
 [Silkk] when I stop by 
 (Master P) 
 We ain't LL but we jus those type of guys 
 Thugs in the club with them bottles in the sky 
 My wrist sittin' on 24 carats 
 Rookies tuckin in they chains they must be embarrassed 
 (Silkk) 
 I slide through grab a couple of bottles 
 Later on fly threw grab a couple of models 
 You a balla you outside or in 
 I pulled up there's more outside then in 
 Niggaz in the parkin lot sparkin blunts 
 Like if you ain't on 20's or above don't park out front 
 Some couple of dudes ran up the street 
 Tried to park and run 
 Get back to the spot 
 Once I get back to the yact 
 (Master P) 
 I'm on the dance floor with trina and tasha 
 I'm a actor so its juice and vodka 
 Tell the waiter more champagne for shorty 
 We in a V.I.P. and bout to get naughty

 (Curren$y) 
 Call me on a Sunday 
 You no a dawg could roll through 
 In a black 350z with no roof 
 Excuse me I don't no what they told you 
 But I'm gettin' in for free anywhere that I go to 
 Curren$y the high spitter got hella flows 
 Rock platinum rolls white, yellow gold 
 Got the world in my hand won't let it go 
 I'm not a lightweight 'cause I got heavy dough 
 Young dude ice so chunky 
 Game so smooth that's why they want me 
 Ooh too cool way to flossy 
 If that's your boo you better get her off me
