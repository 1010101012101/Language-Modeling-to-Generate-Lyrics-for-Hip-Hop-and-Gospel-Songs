Silkk the shocker lyrics 
 "Who I Be" 
 (Master P) 
 Silkk the Shocker after completing your duties 
 On this Charge it to the Game 
 You're now ranked the highest soldier in the No Limit army 
 (Silkk) 
 Master P the colonel, lieutenant, wise, Big V, hope 
 Prime Suspect, C-Murder, Mac, Fiend, Mia, Serv, Craig B 
 KLC, Mo.B, and I'm Silkk the Shocker 
 (Master P) 
 Fuckin' seven stars, ya heard me 
 Ain't nobody touching you, soldiers 
 It's time for you to lead the pack 
 (Kane and Abel, Mystikal, Gambino's, Tscott) 
 (Silkk) 
 Give me some mutherfuckin room as I kick open this door, ah! 
 (See a nigga been waiting on this shit) 
 (Silkk) 
 Well I'm here now, so you ain't got to wait no fucking more 
 'Cause I've been running this bitch from New Orleans, to Korea 
 Ask you ass like Veya, 'Cause I want a million like Aaliyah 
 Nigga, I got nothing but six triggas, rollin' wit six niggas 
 Six triggas, run a check on you with six digits 
 Nigga what you mean. I be quick nigga 
 Everybody got a heart from the smaller ones, to a big nigga 
 And y'all know I don't play, Not go on, and I don't stay 
 See, you know I'm bout G's 
 Look, cut the blunt open, and lace it wit weed 
 Cause tonight's the fuckin' night 
 When I get down and fuckin' dirty to earn me some stripes 
 At first it's going to be kinda hard to shallow 
 (MasterP:) Uh 
 (Silkk) 
 'Cause I lay this one down right 
 For the North, East, South, West 
 Stay on the line so you can follow 
 I'm going to bring the ruckus 
 Going to take my No Limit chain off 
 But not unless I'm in the bed 
 And it get to hot while I'm fucking 
 (MasterP:) Uh 
 (Silkk) 
 Discussed y'all can't touch us, Y'all some busters 
 If y'all looking for us, we ani't hard to find 
 You know were we at bitch 
 Now what bitch 
 (MasterP:) Soldier 
 (Silk:) Who I be 
 A no limit nigga 
 (Silk:) What I See 
 How we grow bigger 
 (Silk:) What a set 
 The tank around my neck 
 (Silk:) and what that represent 
 That represent respect 
 (MasterP:) Huh respect 
 (Silkk) 
 A million TRU niggas walking wit gats 
 We Soldier I told ya, and that's that 
 Ah. 
 Empty bullets arouse from my shells 
 For every bullet that drop it's a story to tell (damn) 
 Gotta make sure he ain't breathing no more 
 He done crossed the fucking deli, time to even the score 
 See I'm bout to mention a hungry rockweller (Uh) 
 Entourage full of empoller, we riding dope wit top dollars. 
 If I ain't the toughest then show me who is? 
 Tell me where he live, and I guarantee 
 I'll shoot the shit he did, and more 
 This TRU blood is running through my veins 
 I'll seeing this high life has got me addicted to fast life and pain 
 But what left the game not the vain 
 Born to be forever rapping or in the dope game 
 See I done been places, and I done seen things 
 My whole dream is to be a kingpin, and try to sling 'caine 
 But see I run through like a track meet 
 Run dope through this whole street 
 Ask P, Ask P, tax free on these backstreets 
 (Ain't that shit illegal?) I hope they caught 
 Cause murder, homicde, drivebys 
 And drug deals where blood spil 
 My glock will tell you (oh yeah Silkk that's real) 
 I'm a soldier 
 (Silk:) Who I BE? 
 (MasterP:) What? Who I be. 
 (Silk:) Who I BE? 
 A no limit nigga 
 (Silk:) Who I Be? 
 (MasterP:) What? 
 (Silk:) Who I be? 
 A no limit nigga 
 (Silk:) Who I Be? 
 (MasterP:) A No Limit Nigga 
 (Silk:) Who I Be? 
 A No Limit Nigga 
 (Silk:) Who I be? 
 (MasterP:) A NO LIMIT NIGGA 
 (Silk:) Who I BE? 
 A no limit nigga!
