(Chorus: Russell Lee & (Chingo)) 
 Dear Mr. president you always tellin' us that it's all good 
 But you ain't neva been in my hood 
 You wanna now what it's like, then come take a ride with me 
 And let me show you that it's real... (Real) 
 Always telling us there's gonna be a change... (A change?) 
 But we now it's some bullshit maine (Bullshit) 
 The sun don't shine through the rain (The rain) 
 Even though you forgot about us... 
 (Verse 1: Chingo Bling) 
 Dear George Bush I'm here to talk shit to ya 
 Take notes, kick spit to ya 
 I'm at the white House door just ride with me 
 I'ma take you on a tour just ride with me 
 Take you to the streets of Magnolia, take you to da bordera 
 Pick you up, ride around and show ya 
 A bunch of shit that you already know 
 When their's a war tell me why were the first ones to go 
 Look, my daddy crossed da border about 38 years ago 
 That kinda sacrifice, You ain't never seen before 
 He said he's marching downtown but his feet hurt 
 Besides the rent is due, puto, and we need work 
 44 37 yep I now you now about it 
 But how you acting man, look like you ain't worried about it 
 Another promise, another press conference 
 Another politician acting like they being honest. 
 (Chorus: Russell Lee) 
 Dear Mr. president you always tellin' us that it's all good 
 But you ain't neva been in my hood 
 You wanna now what it's like, then come take a ride with me 
 And let me show you that it's real... 
 Always telling us there's gonna be a change... 
 But we now it's some bullshit maine 
 The sun don't shine through the rain 
 Even though you forgot about us... 
 (Verse 2: Chingo Bling) 
 We gets campaign money, who you gonna vote for 
 Might vote for puffy or might vote for Oprah. 
 Hell I don't now, I'm trying to see who ain't full of it 
 Because seven years after 9/11 still ain't at the root of it 
 Then you gonna call your son, tell him come, carrying his rifle 
 Because you were to busy voting for American Idol 
 All the satellites and you still can't find no Osoma 
 The dollar dropped so the Mexicans are moving to China 
 The last dude who won got us looking like a damn clown 
 Statue in New York shook her head and put her hand down 
 I might be from da hood, but you ain't fooling me 
 You jerk me around and calling it Homeland Security 
 (Chorus: Russell Lee) 
 Dear Mr. president you always tellin' us that it's all good 
 But you ain't neva been in my hood 
 You wanna now what it's like, then come take a ride with me 
 And let me show you that it's real... 
 Always telling us there's gonna be a change... 
 But we now it's some bullshit maine 
 The sun don't shine through the rain 
 Even though you forgot about us... 
 (Verse 3: Chingo Bling) 
 Lying from da gutta you think a debt card is keeping all those people happy. 
 Cameras on every corner saying they protecting us 
 Taking away my rights got me feeling like I'm a prisoner 
 Code yellow, code green, code red, code orange, serial numbers on me. Putting a chip on my arms. 
 Sound like a matrix, the vision is scary. 
 Tell da truth not a neighborhood conspiracy theory. 
 There's a war going on, now they want to try and get me 
 Turn on the TV but all you see is Britney. 
 So why vote if our vote don't count 
 But when it's time to tally up, their gonna change the amount. 
 (Chorus: Russell Lee) 
 Dear Mr. president you always tellin' us that it's all good 
 But you ain't neva been in my hood 
 You wanna now what it's like, then come take a ride with me 
 And let me show you that it's real... 
 Always telling us there's gonna be a change... 
 But we now it's some bullshit maine 
 The sun don't shine through the rain 
 Even though you forgot about us...
