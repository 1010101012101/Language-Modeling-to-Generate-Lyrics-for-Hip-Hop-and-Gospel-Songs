 You better wash your ass 
 She got the pan 
 But not the pan you find in the kitchen 
 I'd be hopin and wishin that she go'n give me permission 
 To big in the cookie jar give me a piece 
 Your right I'm a dog and I'm off the leash 
 But if I give you a lunch you know the things I do 
 Take it off break it off girl chunk the do 
 My bad I thought it was cool with you 
 My bad I said you were beautiful 
 My bad I thought we could do the fool 
 My bad fuck me well fuck you too 
 But if I put the bannana in the doughnut 
 I already know lil mama go nuts 
 She said she good but acted like most sluts 
 Give me a little bit then she gave me both buts 
 We ain't married yeah we're grown ups 
 But I'm married man so what 
 She got the pan 
 More pan then pan erilla 
 Gave me the pan 
 When she saw my harderia 
 I hit her her sister y tambien su tia 
 In a rigo a caddi and a kia sofia 
 She said her rims keep spinnin is that gruejria 
 No mama I'm sick I got balleria 
 Make a left on postal get out the car we're here 
 Then she opened my door at galleria 
 She no how to tease

 Bought cleto a leash and ate a 2 piece 
 Like I said she bought me a chain and a piece

 Broke the girl off and brag her a ben of lungia
