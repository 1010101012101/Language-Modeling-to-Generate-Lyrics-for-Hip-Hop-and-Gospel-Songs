 (Verse 1: Chingo Bling) 
 Glock down when I'm ridin' in yo town 
 When they see this wet back, they get to wipin' me down 
 Chingo Bling, Culetro, I make them hoes drop drawers 
 When they see the cowboy hat and hot sauce 
 Man, I can't keep up, there's new dances every week 
 These Niggas get ridicoulous, they snappin in they sleep 
 They doin' it like me, they shufflin they feet 
 They dooka-dooka-dooka, drop it to the beat 
 Get Hyphy wit it, now put them ants in yo pants 
 And Poke yo booty out and do the motorcycle dance 
 See, my moves just 
 The party in the lot, when I crank up my drop 
 On the southside, all we do is body roc 
 So do what you do, till that thang get sweaty 
 I make them say "Mane, that's my Jam" (Already)

 Do whatever it takes, hit the dance flo', and get to a space 
 Do the Lil Bow Wow, baby,(?) and shake it 
 Yo hips and yo waist is rockin', everybody watchin 
 The way you make yo booty to Pop, Lock, and Drop it 
 My partners lookin' at ya, we tryin' to look at the back of ya 
 I'm tryin' to get you in the passenger side of that Acura 
 The African Americans, Mexicans, and White Chicks 
 Might fit the (?), Straight twist like a Sidekick 
 The Fly Bitchs on the scene, snap into the shoulder lean 
 A party ain't a party without young Coast and Chingo Bling 
 We the Kings of this whole H-town Mix 
 Nawf side, southside, ain't nothin' to mess with 
 The best in the night life, better yet the high life 
 We looking for some beezes, we ain't lookin' for the wife type 
 Bright lights, black lights, strobe lights, fog Machines 
 Everybody in the club dancin' to this song we sing

 Pause... not! 
 If you hate yo baby mama say "ah"! (ah!) 
 If yo child support keeper lookin' fly 
 Ladies, if yo baby daddy lookin' ugly 
 But yo ain't trippin' 'cause he givin' you the money (Cha-Ching) 
 If yo (?) string hangin' out, pull it out 
 Show them boys what its about 
 If they ain't to it, I'm drunk enough to do it 
 Everbody in this bitch let me hear you say "Do it"!
