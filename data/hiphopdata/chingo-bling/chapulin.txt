Trunk gon' bang and my 5th wheel hang 
 No matter what you say, I'ma do my thang 
 Screens gon' fall and my slab gon' crawl 
 I don't know about y'all, but I ball 
 (Indistinct screwed and chopped rapping) 
 I don't know about y'all, but I ball 
 I'm from the city where the flows get chopped up 
 You ever see a taco truck, doors cocked up? 
 The police, man, they rather see me locked up 
 On MTV, I had my trunk just popped up 
 Independent ballin', big dog status 
 Monte Carlo cutlasses and old school caddies 
 Fool on the steering wheel, naw, this ain't no blue tooth 
 Look at my grill, puto, I got a blue tooth 
 She thought blades was a Wesley snipes movie 
 Tell them put 'em on 26's, dammit chop the booty, ha 
 Chingo bling on the scene, trick, I'm looking clean 
 Red and Yellow slab, kids call me Chauplin 
 I got the 13 (?) in my candy apple drop 
 Got the top let back, the wet back don't stop 
 In the kitchen, on a mission, Yeah, I'm cooking up pigeon 
 And I'm watch Beaner Entertainment Televison, Y'all 
 Had it for a minute, now it's my turn to ball 
 Black tee, 2x tall, they can't deport us all 
 I got on for sell, mane, what's (?) 
 Space Age, sell tamales on the internet 
 Aslyum cut the check and Big Chile be the label 
 Down in H-town, we slow it down and turn tables 
 Chingo bling in the flesh, jump out yo TV screen 
 Immigration's nightmare and your baby mama's wet dream
