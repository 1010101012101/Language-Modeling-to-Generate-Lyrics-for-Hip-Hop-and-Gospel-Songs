Oh my goodness I cannot believe this 
 Did you see that mayne? 
 Oh my god she got a thong on to the beach. 
 Baby with all that cellulite you got goin' on down dere 
 You need to wear a beach blanket 
 Not a beach towel okay? 
 Oh that guts so scandalous 
 You know that girl can't handle it 
 Eating that twinkie like a big old witch 
 With a look in your eye like she want some fried fish 
 She like to eat at the buffet spot 
 She will eat everything even crumbs and drops 
 Macaroni and Cheese she ate the whole pot 
 She was eatin chalupa loca 
 She eat chicken by the truck truck truck 
 Hams like what what what 
 Baby tuck your gut gut gut 
 I think I sing it again 
 She eat chicken by the truck truck truck 
 Hams like what what what 
 All night long you never feed that thong 
 Oh baby look at that fat ass go blat bla blat blat blat 
 I hate it when your gut go bla bla bla blat 
 I hate it when your flap goes bla bla bla blat 
 I think you need to do some situps 
 'Cause that thong sure don't fit you mami 
 Oh my goodness loco it's too big 
 Baby crack kills okay? 
 I see you later homie
