Work that, jerk that, now work that 
 Jerk that, now take that, take that 
 Now make that, make that 
 Now bring it back, bring it back 
 Now bring it back, bring it back 
 Face down, tune it up 
 You want this money, then back it up 
 Mama say, mama sa, ma-manosa 
 Mama say, mama sa, ma-manosa 
 Mama say, mama sa, ma-manosa 
 Chingo Bling in the house, que te pasa 
 With a big booty thick girl jiggle like Playdoe 
 One eye closed and far away, she like J-Lo 
 She go hard but that one go harder 
 Ooh Lord, must be something in the water 
 It's Chingo Bling, going hotten than salsa 
 Bout to run the game, playboy, you better boss up 
 (Sweat) 
 Sweat 'til it smells like barcas 
 (Sweat) 
 Sweat 'til it smells like patas 
 (Sweat) 
 It's Sabado, ponle la bata 
 Habre la boca y taste this horchata 
 Work that, jerk that, now work that 
 Jerk that, now take that, take that 
 Now make that, make that 
 Now bring it back, bring it back 
 Now bring it back, bring it back 
 Face down, tune it up 
 You want this money, then back it up 
 New skirt, just got her hair done 
 What about the panies? No, she don't wear none 
 Here my number, call me long distance 
 Can't call Mexico? Buy some more minutes 
 Take a picture, put that on the wall 
 'Cause them kind of boots, they ain't got on the mall 
 I'm V.I.P., we ain't s'pposed to be smokin' 
 But guess what, laws was meant to be broken 
 Wetback, just like Gilligan 
 Worth a million, country like [unverified] 
 She got moist when she noticed the paint job 
 A pimp by night but tamales my day job 
 Work that, jerk that, now work that 
 Jerk that, now take that, take that 
 Now make that, make that 
 Now bring it back, bring it back 
 Now bring it back, bring it back 
 Face down, tune it up 
 You want this money, then back it up 
 Vieja 
 Ponte la bata, es Sabado 
 Horchata, jamaica, tres leches, tamarindo 
 If you see la miga, you better tell Chingo 
 Say chile con carne, Chile con carne 
 Say you don't got no diamonds 
 You don't got no diamonds 
 Say chile con carne 
 Chile con carne 
 'Cause Chingo tiene hambre 
 'Cause Chingo tiene hambre 
 Say gimme what you got for a torta

 Gimme what you got for a torta

 Say gimme what you got for a torta

 Gimme what you got for a torta

 Mama say, Mama sa, ma-manosa

 Chingo Bling in the house, que te pasa 
 Work that, jerk that, now work that 
 Jerk that, now take that, take that 
 Now make that, make that 
 Now bring it back, bring it back 
 Now bring it back, bring it back 
 Face down, tune it up 
 You want this money, then back it up 
 All right, all right, all right 
 A lot of you guys don't know the real definition of manosa 
 Some of you manosas, don't even know you're manosa 
 A manosa is any girl that does nasty stuff 
 That shows her stuff for some moneys 
 That's right, the pesos, the counterfeit 
 The cheddar cheese chalupas 
 Work that, jerk that, now work that 
 Jerk that, now take that, take that 
 Now make that, make that 
 Now bring it back, bring it back 
 Now bring it back, bring it back 
 Face down, tune it up 
 You want this money, then back it up 
 Chingobling dot com sa la lavan, se toman la agua 
 Peace out, hey you, manosa 
 Pick up your money off the floor, you're making a mess 
 Stupid
