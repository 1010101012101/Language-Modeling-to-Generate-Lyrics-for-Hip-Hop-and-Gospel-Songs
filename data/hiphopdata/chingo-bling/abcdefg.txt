 Wake up early in da mornin 
 Six a clock roosters crowin 
 Hopped up out the bedroom mama said chingo where you goin' 
 Hot shower pepe growin'

 Diamonds all up in jer face

 Rubbin tities chowin love

 Just when she needs to play when she's feelin' hornay

 When I'm comin' down on slap but I say peanut butter jelly 
 Who that is takin' tris all the way to poker nose

 Makin' moves makin' movies 
 With jer mom in my jaquuzee 
 A little fluzie named suzie 
 Tried to get crunk and tried to sue me 
 But I got a hungry lawyer that eat cases like chop suey 
 From city to city we get love and ball hard 
 So we don't need credit cards 
 Or sucka security guards

 Throw manosas part two but I had to chunk duece

 Poppin' trunk in the hood chingo bling little putos
