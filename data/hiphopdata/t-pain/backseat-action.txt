 Baby I've been waiting for you to come home 
 'Cause I done cleaned out the backseat, clean the top 
 And Put some new 24s on the brome 
 Lately I been waiting to try something new 
 'Cause we done did every last one your fantasys 
 But we ain't did nothing I wanna do 
 'Cause we done did it in the elevator (been there done that) 
 Now its time to do it my way (I know you want that) 
 And pullin your hair wont even compare 
 To what I'm bout to do to you on this highway 
 I'm talkin' bout that backseat action 
 Out in the middle of the traffic 
 I'm bout to pull over and give you the business 
 Holla at me 
 Can I get a witness

 Make it roll 
 Break it down or Take it slow 
 Take control 
 Make it go 
 Break it down 
 Now, here we go x2 
 (Repeat) 
 Shawty you can call me whenever you need 
 Working in the excursion, kissing in the expedition 
 Like yes indeeed 
 Baby it's all gravy, it's all good 
 'Cause we gonna need to open up the back door and let ya legs out 
 Or imma put ya right on the hood 
 Up and down like an elevator (been there done that) 
 I know you like to do it my way (I know you want that) 
 And pullin your hair wont even compare 
 To what I'm bout to do to you on this highway 
 I'm talkin' bout that backseat action out in the middle of the traffic 
 I'm bout to pull over and give you the business 
 Holla at me

 Face down ass up that's the way I like it rough 
 Clouded up like it rough 
 Drivers seat to the passenger 
 Back to the back all in the act

 Hands on the window foot on the wheel 
 Face to the seat rep to the beat 
 Rockin' it rockin' it make it squeak 
 Stop Stop Stop Stop 
 What cha gonna do somebody might see 
 So make it fast 
 Take it slow break it down make it roll 
 Take control make it slow

 Backseat action out in the middle of the traffic 
 Bout to pull over and give you that business 
 Holla at me 
 Can I get a witness 
 Here we go
