Yeah uh 
 Nappy boy 
 Ah man 
 (Sigh) 
 Aye, I know you think it's gonna take 4 niggas star to respect 
 The blood and the tears and the sweat 
 And still don't ferget where the so called ideas came from 
 Or who they call for ideas when they ain't none 
 Who carry them on there shoulders when they can't run 
 Its hard work when you find out it ain't fun 
 But hard work will turn a man into a bitch 
 But hard work ain't shit compared to hard dicks, So 
 Ain't nobody fuck with me, I'm unfuckwitable 
 Record labels hit the ground when I hit the doe 
 They say we need a first single for Mr. so and so 
 And Mrs. bitch over here don't even know where to go 
 Since everybody need directions 
 I put out the mix tape so listen to my lecture 
 I bet cha 
 I tell you that the game is just a game it's not hard 
 Up down, Up down, A.b. star 
 You go R-e-s-p-e-c-t T me T p Tallahassee Florida 
 And if somebody don't got me what I need and I need to see everything else in order 
 In order for me to see me being what I need to be then somebody else gone be much less 
 Dig that 
 Until then imma spit the real end of it 
 Otherwise fuck it 
 Dig that 
 Yeah, these swat niggas wanna make me be outtie 
 So I bought me a outtie 
 'Cause when I get the rest, I go and get a whip 
 And the only challenger I got is still at the Dodge dealership, damn 
 You nigga's ain't feeling me yet 
 He in here for crazy ass for that T-pain affect 
 And T-pain and shit 
 To step on a nigga toes 
 But my nigga's been known to fuck with 'A' nigga holes 
 Can't stand the heat then get the fuck up the restraunt 
 I make the niggas feel low 
 Somebody get the blunt 
 Somebbody get this kinda Tapon quick 
 I'm throwin' tricks at these tricks 
 I'm on my 'And 1' shit 
 Tallahassee Gold Trauter 
 Ready like rambo 
 Get the fast cash a hard lass in the lambo 
 Its nothing but a game it's not hard 
 Up down, up down, A.B. star 
 You go R-e-s-p-e-c-t T-Me T-P Tallahassee Florida 
 And if somebody don't got me what I need and I need to see everything else in order 
 In order for me to see me being what I need to be then somebody else gone be much less 
 Dig that 
 Until then imma spit the real end of it 
 Otherwise fuck it 
 Dig that
