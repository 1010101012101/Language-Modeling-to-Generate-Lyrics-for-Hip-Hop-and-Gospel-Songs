Aye... look here man... this another Teddy Pernderazz beat jack. C'mon, let me lock down the booth real quick. 
 I'm steady tryin' to find me a motor to put up in my ride 
 Tryin' to be a roller, tryin' to hit the South Side 
 Now they done put one in 
 Fucked up my transmission 
 And they don't know about all this pussy I'm missin' 
 (Chorus: T-Pain (Background T-Pain vocals)) 
 That's fucked up 
 Know what I'm talkin' bout 
 Know what I'm talkin' bout 
 That's fucked up 
 Know what I'm talkin' bout (you) 
 Know what I'm talkin' bout 
 And that's fucked up 
 Know what I'm talkin' bout 
 Know what I'm talkin' bout 
 Now they done got me fucked up 
 Know what I'm talkin' bout (you) 
 Know what I'm talkin' bout 
 I wanna see my lady (lady) 
 She bout to have my baby (baby) 
 But I can't get to her 
 We talk on the phone, but it's just not enough 
 'Cause when she's talkin' dirty, I wanna do that freaky stuff and 
 My bill's two months late and my credit's fucked up 
 Now I stack my paper and it's time to come up 
 See I dun got my money 
 Now I feel alot better 
 But I don't got no weed, and I gotta wear this holy sweater and 
 See man... I be off on that shit man... blazin', drinkin'... all my dogs around me and niggaz be lookin' at me and shit with the sleepy eyes and shit... and they be like "Dog guess what? " and I be like "what? " and they be like "Dog I'm... 
 (Half-Chorus)
