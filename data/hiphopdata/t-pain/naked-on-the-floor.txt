T-Pain: 
 I got the hat, I got the shoes, I got the outfit 
 I go outside and pick the ride I'm gon' go out with 
 But right before I hit the streets 
 I gotta put on my dancing shoes in the mirror 
 T-Pain: 
 Now, walk with it, walk with it 
 Now, step with it, step with it 
 Now, slide with it, slide with it 
 Now, ride with it, ride with it 
 Now, walk with it, walk with it 
 Now, get low 
 Now, and I know where I'm 'bout to go 
 (Chorus: T-Pain) 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Come and juke it with me 
 Shawty was in the corner, now she's looking for me 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 That's what I do 
 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm jukin with you 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Come and juke it with me 
 Shawty was in the corner, now she's looking for me 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 That's what I do 
 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm jukin with you 
 On the dance floor 
 T-Pain: 
 I hit the club and I'm ready for a dance off (a dance off) 
 Me and Dizm 'bout to blow a nigga pants off (his pants off) 
 So if he wanna ride with me 
 I'm 'bout to do the same thing that I did in the mirror 
 T-Pain: 
 Now, walk with it, walk with it 
 Now, step with it, step with it 
 Now, slide with it, slide with it 
 Now, ride with it, ride with it 
 Now, walk with it, walk with it 
 Now, get low 
 Now, and I know where I'm 'bout to go 
 (Chorus: T-Pain) 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Come and juke it with me 
 Shawty was in the corner, now she's looking for me 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 That's what I do 
 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm jukin with you 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Come and juke it with me 
 Shawty was in the corner, now she's looking for me 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 That's what I do 
 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm jukin with you 
 On the dance floor 
 Tay Dizm: 
 Ey this is Yo' boy Tay Dizm 
 You know what I'm saying 
 That kunamattata you know 
 Ey, I'm doing this here for the south 
 You know what I'm saying 
 My nigga Pain 
 And I told y'all niggas before he dropped this 
 'Cause anything we touch we known to be the shit 
 Like an old school body that's good all out 
 From the grill to the paint to the dog in the back to the jump off 
 And if he's not gonna set it off, hit the club, get you thinkin' it's the marti gras 
 And who's step up to my crew, then this is what my crew gon' do my nigga 
 T-Pain: 
 Now, walk with it, walk with it 
 Now, step with it, step with it 
 Now, slide with it, slide with it 
 Now, ride with it, ride with it 
 Now, walk with it, walk with it 
 Now, get low 
 Now, and I know where I'm 'bout to go 
 (Chorus: T-Pain) 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Come and juke it with me 
 Shawty was in the corner, now she's looking for me 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 That's what I do 
 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm jukin with you 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 Come and juke it with me 
 Shawty was in the corner, now she's looking for me 
 I'll be on the dance floor 
 That's what I do 
 In a minute I'll be in it and I'm jukin with you 
 On the dance floor
