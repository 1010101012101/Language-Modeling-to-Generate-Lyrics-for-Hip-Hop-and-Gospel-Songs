 Have you ever seen

 And you just want to let her know who you are, are-are 
 So you say, let me buy you a drink 
 Or a little conversation 
 If that's what you want to do, do-do 
 Then she said, love is about to end 
 Then you said, why don't you come to my crib? 
 Then she said, I can't leave my friends 
 Now you've officially been chopped and screwed 
 Screwed-screwed, chopped-chopped and screwed 
 You've officially been dance-dance screwed 
 And 'ewed-'ewed, chopped screwed-screwed

 Making you feel like she so in love, love-love 
 Now you done grabbed you a couple a drinks 
 And you feeling like it's about that time to cuddle up, up-up

 And she takes big sip out yo cup 
 Then she said, that'll be 60 bucks
