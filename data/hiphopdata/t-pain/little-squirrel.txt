Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! 
 Yo little squirrel 
 How you doin' now? 
 You been out all night man! 
 Now come on! go in your tree! 
 You eatin' all those little small nuts 
 You crackin' all those little teeth 
 You makin' me crazy, cause now I love you 
 I don't know what's goin' on now 
 But I know I'm in the zone for it 
 I know I can do this, 'cause I been waitin' all night now 
 Come out little squirrel 
 I need to see your face 
 With those big puppy eyes 
 And that little tiny face 
 Now just come out for me 
 'Cause I need to see you 
 And if you don't, I will have to kill you 
 So please little squirrel, come out and play 
 I wanna touch your little belly, and play all friken' day 
 Peace!
