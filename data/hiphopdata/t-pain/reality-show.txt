 Skinny funk, rock girl, fat girl

 Like her right there in those stilleto shoes 
 And shorty showin' off her legs for me

 Good as thirty one flavors, and I feel like, oh shit

 Anythin' you want, stop trippin'

 So each and every night we gon' switch it up 
 And you ain't gotta worry, I'ma wrap it up

 Just have a little fun with them 
 And if I do then you can chose 
 And that's the one who lose
