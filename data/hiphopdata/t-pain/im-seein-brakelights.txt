I'm seeing brake lights 
 That means he's leaving me again 
 This is like the eighth time 
 I guess I'll see him in morning 
 'Cause he'll come back, he always does 
 And then we fight and then we fuss again 
 Back to the beginning 
 But we hate to make up every time 
 But when we do break up the fault is mine 
 But before we fall out there is something you should know 
 I hate to see you leave but I love, 
 To watch you go 
 Love to watch you go 
 I'm seein' daylight, and I'm still alone in my bed 
 Something ain't right, so should I go for him instead 
 I messed up this time, I always do 
 And then we fight and then were through again 
 Back to the beginning 
 But we hate to make up every time 
 But when we do break up the fault is mine 
 But before we fall out there is something you should know 
 I hate to see you leave but I love, 
 To watch you go 
 Love to watch you go 
 Whose gonna help me save us, he made us one again 
 Will he take me back this time 
 After what I did, he has no idea 
 Why he just spent one more night here 
 But we hate to make up every time 
 But when we do break up the fault is mine 
 But before we fall out there is something you should know 
 I hate to see you leave but I love, 
 To watch you go
