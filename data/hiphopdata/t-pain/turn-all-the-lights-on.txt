Turn all the lights on... 
 (T-Pain) 
 Take off your shoes (shoes shoes) 
 Ain't nobody gon' see nothin' 
 Bring out the booze (booze booze) 
 Baby girl stop frontin' 
 Ain't nothin' to lose (lose lose) 
 And I ain't gotta work no more 
 F-ck that place, f-ck my boss 
 I'm about to ball girl where the cars 
 So I'm going hard 
 I need some lights, it's way too dark 
 Oh yeah I'm going in 
 And now I'm with my friends 
 Let the party begin! 
 Turn all the lights on! 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A A-Ah 
 Turn all the lights on! 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A A-Ah 
 Put your hands up if you're going hard 
 I need some lights, it's way too dark 
 Oh yeah I'm going in 
 Okay okay I'm with my friends 
 Let the party begin 
 Turn all the lights on! 
 (Ne-Yo) 
 Give me that glass, little bit of ice 
 Pour that rain in there 
 This must be her song 
 Dancing like ain't nobody else in here 
 Sexy as she wanna be and she 
 Dancing next so close to me 
 I said please excuse 
 You steppin' on expensive shoes 
 Shawty is a perfect ten 
 This angelic body made you sin 
 I love the way you get it in 
 Come over here and shake it for a gentleman 
 Cause you want it 
 She's going hard 
 I need some lights it's way too dark 
 Oh yeah I'm going in 
 And now I'm with my friends 
 Let the party begin! 
 Turn all the lights on! 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A A-Ah 
 Turn all the lights on! 
 A-A-A-A-A-A-A A-Ah 
 Put your hands up if you're going hard 
 I need some lights, it's way too dark 
 Oh yeah I'm going in 
 Okay okay I'm with my friends 
 Let the party begin 
 Turn all the lights on! 
 (Ne-Yo - Bridge) 
 I'm drinking something 
 I'm touching something 
 They need to turn up the lights 
 (Turn up the lights) 
 I'm drinking something

 They need to turn up the lights 
 (Turn up the lights) 
 I'm drinking something tonight 
 I'm touching something tonight 
 They need to turn up the lights 
 (Turn up the lights) 
 I'm drinking something tonight 
 I'm touching something tonight 
 They need to turn up the lights 
 Somebody... 
 Turn all the lights on! 
 Turn all the lights on! 
 Put your hands up if you're going hard 
 I need some lights it's way too dark 
 Ooh yeah I'm going in 
 Okay okay I'm with my friends
