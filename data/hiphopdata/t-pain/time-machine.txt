 Goin' on a trip I be back home boy I'll see you later 
 Goin' back to a time where I know every thing was straighter 
 And everything's great now 
 But back then it was greater 
 And I don't need no clothes 
 I'll go in just what I'm wearin 
 Matter fact I'll just go back with what I used wear then 
 No matter how bad the weather 
 Everything back then was just so better 
 I can dream 
 It's a simple thing 
 I'm building a time machine 
 Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back in time 
 I can dream 
 It's a simple thing 
 Building a time machine 
 Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back in time 
 I can dream 
 It's a simple thing 
 I'm building a time machine 
 Yeah 
 Goin' back to a time where this music shit was more than business 
 Back to a time when I knew my niggas was down and if they still is 
 And I didn't have to worry bout what I got on when I go outsizzide 
 And I didn't have to worry bout what kinda car I got when I rizzide 
 And I didn't have to have twenty-twos, twenty-fours to twenty-sixes 
 And I didn't have to be forever surrounded by a million bitches 
 No matter how bad my life was 
 I still got love no matter how mad my wife was 
 I can dream 
 It's a simple thing 
 I'm building a time machine 
 Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back in time 
 I can dream 
 It's a simple thing 
 I'm building a time machine 
 Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back in time 
 I can dream 
 It's a simple thing 
 Building a time machine 
 Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back in time 
 Simple thing 
 Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back in time 
 Simple thing 
 Building a time machine
