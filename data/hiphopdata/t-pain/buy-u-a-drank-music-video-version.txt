 A certified dime piece 
 Deserve louie 1-3

 I'm checkin' yo body language 
 I love the conversation 
 And when you lick your lips 
 I get a tingly sensation 
 Now we both bout tipsy 
 You say you in the mood 
 All I need is bout an hour 
 Better yet, maybe two 
 Let me take you where I live 
 Ferrari switch gears 
 When I whisper in your ear 
 Ya legs hit the chandelier 
 Passion fruit and sex 
 All in the atmosphere 
 Ima let t-pain sing it 
 So he can make it clear 
 Ima buy you a drank 
 Then ima take you home with me 
 I got money in the bank 
 Shawty whatchu think bout that 
 I be in the grey cadillac 
 We in the bed like 
 Ooh ooh oh,(whoa-o, whoa-o), ooh ooh 
 We in the bed like 
 Ooh ooh ooh,(whoa-o, whoa-o, whoa-o, ooh), ooh ooh 
 Let's get gone

 You can do it all by yoself
