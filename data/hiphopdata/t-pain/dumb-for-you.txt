Okay, did I do it, did I put the key in [the door](undefined) 
 And lock that thang down 
 Did I hit it? Yes I did 
 On the problem is you got a boyfriend, and he way too hot now 
 She ain't say nothing bout Mary, so don't get carried away and get buried 
 It can get real dumb, and ignorant, Killa City's where I'm from idiot 
 See here's the deal, she got a baby buy some young punk 
 Runner run up on me, it's feeling too ill 
 Never check the player, check the game 
 You never came up home 
 I don't know why you did it like that 
 I borrowed your girl and give her right back 
 Give me a little bit of ris out of the carpet that 
 I have a side bar, she don't know how to act 
 You better get her 
 She got go women like it was born in 'er 
 The big old booty keep me warm in the cold winter 
 It can go stupid, that means I'm going [easy](undefined) 
 Where you find her from? Firearri 
 And I'm about to go stupid 
 And I'm always representing where I'm from 
 From, from, from, from, from, from 
 And if a nigga wanna try me, better tell him roll right by me when he come 
 Come, come, come, come, come, come 
 Hey, I'm about to go dumb for you, dumb for you, dumb for you, dumb for you 
 Hey, I'm about to go dumb for you, dumb for you, dumb for you 
 Hey, I'm about to go 
 Your one hundred we so hunterish 
 And you'll be muckin' up when she's bumpin this 
 Mister goodie good could change it to make it hood 
 I love to keep the piece but I wish a nigga would 
 Leggo it would be different if she sell out 
 Then you know what you had before 
 If I cock it then let it go 
 You go six she lonely and chose me 
 You boarded [home alone](undefined) and tried to blame it on me 
 Keep my family riding with me but sometimes I'm so lo 
 You don't know I can really make it go doe-doe 
 And I ain't have to force her to come 
 Divorce her, before it gets dumb 
 Aha, T-Pa-a-ain 
 Okay, Kali baby
