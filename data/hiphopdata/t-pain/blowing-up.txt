 Slide with a nigga, I'm so electric and baby girl you can bet it all 
 And you ain't gotta sweat it, go home put on that dress 
 Let's go out, there will be no more stressin' 
 And girl tonight I'm gonna be your dog

 Slow wine it, you can jump on in if you want 
 Baby girl don't fight it, you know tonight's your night 
 We can go use it, don't abuse it 'cause you're like 
 Techno music, electronica 
 Baby let's do this, boy I want to love
