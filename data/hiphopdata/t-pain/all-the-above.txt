Yo Pain you ready? Yeah 
 Mane lets lock and load ah ha 
 Just blaze, yeah Lord turn me up 
 B I think we got one, yeah ha, here we go 
 Tell me what do you see, (see) 
 When you looking at me, (Whoa whoa whoa) 
 On a mission to be (be) 
 What I'm destined to be, (Whoa whoa whoa) 
 I've done been through the pain and the sorrow 
 The struggle is nothing but love (Nothing but love) 
 I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above, 
 Hey all the above, all the above, all the above 
 All the above, all the above, all the above, all the above 
 Listen, really what do you see, (See) 
 When you looking at me, (me) 
 See me come up from nothin', 
 To me living my dreams, 
 I have been to the bottom, 
 I done suffered a lot, 
 I deserve to be rich, 
 Headed straight to the top 
 Look how I ride for the block, 
 Look how I rep for the hood, 
 I get nothing but love now when I come through the hood 
 Getting this fortune and fame, 
 Money make all of us change, 
 The new Benz is all white call it John McCain. 
 How the hell could you stop me? 
 Why in the world would you try? 
 I go hard forever, 
 That's just how I'm designed 
 That's just how I was built 
 See the look in my eyes 
 You take all of this from me, 
 And I'm still gon' survive 
 You get truth from me 
 But these rappers gon' lie 
 I'm a part of these streets 
 Till the day that I die 
 I wave hi to the haters mad that I finally done made it 
 Take a look and you can tell that I am destined for greatness. 
 Tell me what do you see, (see) 
 When you looking at me, (Whoa whoa) 
 On a mission to be (be) 
 What I'm destined to be, (Whoa whoa) 
 I've done been through the pain and the sorrow 
 The struggle is nothing but love (Nothing but love) 
 I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above, 
 Hey all the above, all the above, all the above 
 All the above, all the above, all the above, all the above 
 Its easy to hate, 
 Its harder to love me 
 Y'all don't understand, 
 Y'all quickly to judge me. 
 Put your foot in my Nike's 
 Picture you livin' in my life 
 Picture you stuck in a cell 
 Picture you wasting your life 
 Picture you facing a charge 
 Picture you beating the odds 
 Picture you willing to bleed 
 Picture you wearing the scars 
 Thank you for making me struggle 
 Thank you for making me grind 
 I perfected my hustle 
 Tell me the world ain't mine 
 If you ain't seein' me lately 
 I'm a miracle baby 
 I refuse to lose 
 This is what the ghetto done made me 
 I put that on my father 
 Tryna hope for tomorrow 
 When I think that I can't 
 I envision Obama 
 I envision the diamonds 
 I envision Ferrari's 
 If the world was perfect 
 All my niqqas behind me 
 Ain't you happy I made it 
 That I'm making this statement 
 Take a look and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness 
 Tell me what do you see, (see) 
 When you looking at me, (Whoa whoa) 
 On a mission to be (be) 
 What I'm destined to be, (Whoa whoa) 
 I've done been through the pain and the sorrow 
 The struggle is nothing but love (Nothing but love) 
 I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above, 
 Hey all the above, all the above, all the above 
 All the above, all the above, all the above, all the above 
 Now we go to the spot (spot) or if I'm out on the block (block) 
 I hustle hard 'cause it's all the same (they know, they know) 
 And you know that grind don't stop (stop) 
 Just 'cause I rose to the top (top) 
 And everybody knows my name (they know, they know) 
 Hey still grinding (still grinding) 
 Still hustling (still hustling) 
 No more pain (no more pain) 
 No more suffering (no more suffering) 
 From my lady's and my shorties and my thugs 
 Get that cash and the shine and the love 
 All the above, all the above, all the above 
 All the above, all the above, all the above, 
 All the above, all the above, all the above, 
 All the above, all the above, all the above, all the above
