I've been a man ever since I can remember 
 I've never been a big fan of December 
 The nights get cold 
 Nobody there to take care of me 
 Nobody there to tell me that they love me 
 And nobody knows 
 But we were born and raised in the days 
 Where you couldn't even pay to get away from the pain 
 And that's where we live, all day 
 And now we get paid to be slaves of our very own grave 
 And I say it every goddamn day, "That's no way to live" 
 I've been called the murderer, killer 
 I've just played with the hand that they deal us 
 I've been called a loser, an outlaw 
 Shut down in my very own backyard 
 In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance 
 In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance 
 Don't back down, don't back down, not now, not never 
 What's your agenda, I never claimed that I wasn't a sinner 
 Bless my soul 
 I've been down for too many days 
 I might drown in all these haters out of control 
 We were born and raised in the days 
 Where you couldn't even pay to get away from the pain 
 And that's where we live, permanently 
 And now we get paid to be slaves of our very own grave 
 And I say it every goddamn day, "That's no way to live" 
 No, not for me 
 I've been called the murderer, killer 
 I've just played with the hand that they deal us 
 I've been called a loser, an outlaw 
 Shut down in my very own backyard 
 In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance 
 In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance 
 Don't back down, don't back down, not now, not never 
 Who better to fix you other than you? ooh 
 You know exactly what you want, you know exactly what you gotta do 
 You just gotta do it, do it 
 You just gotta do it, do it 
 I've been called the murderer, killer 
 I've just played with the hand that they deal us 
 I've been called a loser, an outlaw 
 Shut down in my very own backyard 
 In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance 
 In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance 
 Don't back down, don't back down, not now, not never
