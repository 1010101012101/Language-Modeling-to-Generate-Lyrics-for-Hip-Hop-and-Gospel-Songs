 Come and lay down 
 Relax 
 Lemme show you what I do 
 Make you feel good 
 React 
 Just as if I were you 
 'Cause I can make you see 
 The heavens 
 Using nothing but my hands 
 If you wanna do me lift my booty 
 Maybe take off my pants 
 (T-Pain and Dawn) 
 What does a real man do for his lady? 
 Anything that he can 
 If you do it right at the end of the night
