Yeah 
 Uh 
 (Clears Throat) 
 (Takes Deep Breath) 
 Keep Going 
 Yeah 
 Mm... 
 They get me up in the morning 
 They give me reason to believe I'm here 
 For somebody 
 Someone 
 They make me feel so joyous 
 Happiness ain't a word to describe 
 What I, 
 Feel 
 Like when I try to give it up; 
 Sick and tired of all this stuff 
 They give me reason to keep going 
 And going 
 When I feel like I should quit 
 I keep going 
 I never knew this would happen 
 And if you knew about my past you would see, 
 Why, 
 It's a miracle 
 But you can see why I'm happy 
 Nobody wishes for me this is prayer 
 Where, 
 Would I be without them? 
 And when I try to give it up 
 Sick and tired of all this stuff 
 When I feel like it's enough 
 I, 
 Keep Going 
 They give me reason, 
 To keep going 
 And going 
 And going
