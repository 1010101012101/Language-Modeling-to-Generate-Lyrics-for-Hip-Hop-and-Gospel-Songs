Throw me in a cage with a lion and a bear 
 Amma kill em 
 They're motivation I ain't lying I swear 
 Am the nigga 
 I got my ear to the streets... back to the bullshit 
 Am tryin' to eat... am on my bullshit 
 Hommie I can't listen to what you sayin' stop talkin' 
 Better watch the way you talk to my clan homie start walkin' 
 Wait a minute 
 Will a nigga really get it if I don't walk I gotta prove it to 'em 
 I think am Big Mitch 
 Larry Hoover 
 Am tryin' to eat 
 U tryin' to sleep 
 If u a dawg 
 Then am a beast ... and the beat goes 
 I know you hate it 
 Here go my motivation bra 
 Am with my dawgs 
 Fuck us... naww nigga fuck y'all ... and the beat goes 
 U know they hate it 
 Let me get you motivated 
 Verse 2: J.Carr 
 Mo money 
 Mo problems 
 Mo haters keep me motivated (yes) 
 You so emotional dawg gone and get your weight up 
 Abuse a track like when I'm beatin' the odds 
 I feel the Heat when I be ballin I relate to Lebron (swish) 
 Yeah Just set a date and its on (swish) 
 Already born to be a king 
 I'm just working on the kong (ha ha) 
 Got Flava Flav tints in my new shades 
 Non Stop stackin and I double up on TWOs days 
 Man I can get it 
 80 seconds in a minute 
 80 minutes in an hour 
 40 hours in a day 
 8 days inside a week 
 I'm motivated in the hunt 
 Steady goin' for the gold 
 5 weeks up in the month 
 I'm tryna eat (why) 
 'Cause I'm a hog (yes) 
 Stick of eatin scraps off the table with my dogs 
 This the Carr 
 Never breaking barely stop to catch my breath 
 Grindin harder than a skater coming down a flight of steps once again 
 [Chorus] T-Pain 
 *T-Pain adlibs outro*
