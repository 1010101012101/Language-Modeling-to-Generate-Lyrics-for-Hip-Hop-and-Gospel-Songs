(Intro - T-Pain) 
 Woo 
 Yeah, yeah, aye 
 Woo 
 Forgive me Father 
 Dear Heavenly Father 
 Ah (Aye) 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Trap (Aye), trap, trap, trap 
 Aye (Aye) [x4] 
 (Chorus - T-Pain) 
 Follow my ghetto commandments 
 You going to really see the way that I handle 
 You going to be the fuck around 
 Or you going to get fucked up 
 It's kill or be killed 
 Get buck or get fucked up, nigga 
 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 hit it one more time 
 Follow my, ghetto commandments 
 Follow my, ghetto commandments 
 (Verse 1 - Snoop Dogg) 
 The run around, the rap around 
 You talk, then you walk, me I'm shutting down 
 See me and the pigs, we don't fuck around 
 That snitching in the hood, let me break that down 
 They do theirs, we do ours, understand me? 
 I'm blued up, Cripping with my family 
 And we don't give a fuck about the 
 PO's, the CO's, because we know 
 That we goes 
 Then do time in parole 
 Now I'm back up on the block at night shift 
 Stack on a Glock, I'm cocking it 
 Back in the block and you know I'm copping it 
 Shoebox full of money with a sock in it 
 And we celebrating the ghetto by popping it 
 So no champagne or Crystol 
 Machine guns or pistols 
 Blat, hood shit 
 Like that? Game over 
 See in my hood we Crip, or dip 
 So follow me, follow me, follow me 
 On some gangster shit, you bitch 
 (Verse 2 - Mack Maine) 
 They say thou shall not talk 
 Thou shall not speak 
 Thou shall bow in the presence of a G 
 I spray mace in a bad boy's eye 
 Leave his shit all puffy so 
 Thou shall not see 
 Thou shall not smile 
 Thou shall never his teeth 
 I'll paint thou or thou shall repeat 
 Thou shall not (Thou shall not) 
 Bitch I said don't talk 
 Shoot you in your ass, head, and feet 
 Now how you going to walk? 
 I'm sick in the head, I piss in the bed 
 Hop up out the ocean, I leave the fisherman red 
 So much blood on the set, the cops hollering out "So woo!" 
 Bitch I'm from New Orleans, you know I know that Froot Loop 
 IPod blasting 2Pac, yeah hit them up 
 Chow down, spit them up 
 Black bag, get them up 
 Call the chef tonight, we having sinners for dinner 
 Ain't no wallets in the hood, so I ain't talking about Twitter 
 And I say 
 [Verse 3 - T-Pain 
 Nigga first of all 
 I'm the first and last 
 You just the first to fall 
 I'm just the first to blast 
 You want to curse us all? 
 Then I'ma have to curse your ass 
 And leave you in the park 
 Underneath a bunch of dirt and grass 
 I'm the only me 
 But I'm the first to bust 
 And you the first victim 
 Quenching my thirst for blood 
 Trust me homie, you don't want to go to work for us 
 I'll turn you hook to ashes 
 And turn your burst to dust 
 Tell me the difference between love and lust 
 Because I love the love 
 But I'm in love with lust 
 Walk up to your bitch and tell her I would love to cut 
 And when them devils come up leave the crack in the crack of her butt 
 Make her lay down in the back of a back of a truck 
 And when she come up like a squirrel 
 She just asking for nuts 
 24's on my Caddy I'm just asked for putt 
 So when you come up in my trap, you're just asking for us
