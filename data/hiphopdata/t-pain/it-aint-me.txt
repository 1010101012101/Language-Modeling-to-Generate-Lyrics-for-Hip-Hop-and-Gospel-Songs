 Intro, T.I.P. 
 ) 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Eh 
 This is for all my cats man 
 Have you ever been in the club? 
 And have a chick kind of run up on you 
 And kind of tell you to buy her a drink, Home? 
 I mean, 
 It ain't what I can do 
 It what I will do 
 And attitude is everything; you know what I'm saying? 
 I mean, 
 A chick who asks for nothing to get everything? 
 A chick who ask for everything or get nothing? 
 Pain, 
 Why don't you, 
 Talk to these motherfucking broke bitches for a minute, would you?

 Verse 1, Tallahassee-Pain

 You may want a man with some consideration (Consideration) 
 Determination (Determination) 
 A little conversation (How you doing baby?) 
 And you might want a man who just ain't straight up nasty (Straight up nasty) 
 From Tallahassee (It's the 850) 
 You're far too classy (Far too classy) 
 So you might want a man who's got a job, (Job) 
 Cars, (Cars) 
 Pillows, (Pillows) 
 Jewelry 
 Girl that just ain't fooling me to you (No) 
 Do you, (No) 
 Think that I'm that easy Shawty? 
 It can't go that breezy Shawty 
 Find another dude cause it ain't me 
 Put you in a Range (Range) 
 Buy expensive things 
 It ain't me babe 
 It ain't me 
 No, it ain't me 
 No way 
 No how 
 Uh-uh

 Verse 2, Akon 
 ) 
 I know you thought you had a sugar daddy 
 Plan to treat me like a her 
 Take my money 'cause I'm attractive 
 Then kick me off to the curb 
 Dine in fancy restaurants 
 Eating expensive h'ordeurves 
 I ain't gonna let you get it all like that 
 But I'ma beating it 
 Girl, that's my word 
 And if you wanna ride, 
 Then I just can't let it slide 
 If you plan to get me for all I got 
 You can start by spending the night 
 Otherwise I'ma see your head get small 
 Unless you're here to make the head get tall 
 If not, gon' get lost cause that ain't me (If not, gon' get lost cause that ain't me) 
 ( 
 Verse 3, T.I. 
 ) 
 Eh, 
 Shawty look so good so she think I should, 
 Throw dough to her like it ain't none to it 
 Get you whatever you like, I could 
 But all I'll be giving you tonight is this wood 
 Hood, 
 To my heart, I'd do it 
 Huge, 
 And your attitude just blew it 
 So rude that your mentalities, 
 Distorting your reality 
 Actually, 
 The more you speak, 
 Make me think where I'd rather be 
 I don't care if you hiding me, 
 'Cause I won't sponsor shopping sprees 
 It's lots of freaks that I could be, 
 Showing my generosity to, 
 Boo, 
 Stop it please? 
 I ain't that guy 
 You ain't that fly 
 Got your head up your ass that's why, 
 All you ask for is all I deny 
 I do for you what I decide 
 And I can buy all kinds of things 
 Go places, 
 Spend all kinds of dough 
 My kindness is no blindness though 
 T-Pain where'd you find this hoe? 
 Haha 
 I know what you want me to do
