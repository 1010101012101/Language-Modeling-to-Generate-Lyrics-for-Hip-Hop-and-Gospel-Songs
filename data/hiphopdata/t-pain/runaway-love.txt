Situation! 
 She's single and the first time 
 This is the worst time 
 'Cause she's only seventeen and she got to have a baby 
 Here comes the hurt time 
 The doctor and the nurse time 
 Should she keep it Yes, No, Maybe 
 She don't know what to do 
 She don't know what to say 
 Cause her momma won't listen 
 Her daddy gets mentioned like everyday 
 She went ahead and did it 
 But she wish she never had 
 She give birth to a 9-pound 6-ounce eyes brown plastic bag 
 She was a runaway love 
 Runaway love 
 Situation! 
 He was a real heavy smoker 
 Shit all his friends was 
 They had a friendship that wouldn't break 
 A bond that wouldn't cut 
 He was always ready to hit it 
 Homeboy wouldn't admit it 
 But he was sprung on that shit 
 The closer he came the weaker he got to back it up 
 Didn't know what he was doing 
 Didn't know who he was hurtin' 
 Till his son and his daughter come smokin' by the tree in the backyard 
 They went and told they momma 
 She said that's something we don't need 
 She said it's either your family or that D (All right) 
 Runaway love 
 Situation! 
 This wasn't puppy love 
 This was a whole 'nother thing 
 And they only was together 
 Because their parent were the same 
 They didn't approve at all 
 Didn't care what they said 
 All this long while 
 They makin' plans in their heads 
 He said "Baby will you marry me?" 
 He started pullin' on her skirt 
 She said "Boy you know I want too my parents don't want me to want You how will it work?" 
 He said "Don't worry 'bout it you know I got you baby" 
 3 o'clock that morning 
 Hello? 
 Baby wake up we gotta go 
 What are we doing? 
 Just gets your bags c'mon 
 Okay baby 
 Runaway love
