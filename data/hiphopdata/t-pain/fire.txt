 More fire, burn through your clothes 
 I get more, higher, burn by the old 
 Hustler's get flyer, burst for the low 
 Hop up on top 
 Oh missy oh 
 (Oh oh missy oh) 
 You never knew what taste good 
 Bread for the head, you know that face good 
 I keep my face clean 
 Well it look like missy on the verse good 
 On the hook right 
 (Right) 
 What I'm doin' now is so ridiculous 
 (Ridiculous) 
 And what I'm giving you in the rendition is 
 Classy missy Elliot, missy misdemeanor 
 Damn 
 How would you feel if I get deeper like 
 Damn 
 Wetter than aquafina believers like 
 Damn 
 Maybe foam when its on then its on like 
 Bam 
 Comparison is water to patron like 
 Damn 
 Understand 
 (T-pain) 
 The feeling that I'm giving you is not a test 
 Everybody that say they doing it is not the best 
 Its simple and plain I can get to you man 
 It's not a game its just missy and pain 
 Motherfucker I'm ill 
 For real 
 Ill 
 For real 
 Ill 
 For real 
 Now break it down 
 Bitch 
 Motherfucker I'm ill 
 Matter of fact I need to take a pill 
 All these hits paying hospital bills 
 All these lips I know you wanna kiss for reals 
 I should let you wear my ice so you can chill 
 I would make a lil but I just made a mil 
 Only hold me to the mike and I won't let it spill 
 Yeah, see my grill? 
 No, not my teeth, it's the grill on the Cadillac I bought last week 
 They say missy don't play missy missy don't play 
 Makin' cheese all day like Frito lay 
 Hey

 He handed me the mike I won't let go till I got blisters 
 Misdemeanor but my flow have gotten meaner 
 It's a it's a it's a felony ch check out my melody 
 Missy got the recipe 
 I can autotune like 
 T-pain zoom I be in the latest 
 (Repeat t-pain)
