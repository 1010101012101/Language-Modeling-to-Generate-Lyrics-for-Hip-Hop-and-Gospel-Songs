Pull up to my crib in ya black Range Rova 
 I got some plans that don't involve my hands 
 Get out and walk up slowly 
 Lemme see your new Menolo's 
 I don't think your ready for what's about to happen behind closed doors 
 And girl 
 I want you to enjoy yourself 
 Have you feelin' so good inside 
 So jump up on this rollercoaster 
 Let me take you for a lappy ride 
 And imma make ya say it (whoa whoa) 
 Say it (whoa whoa) 
 Say it (whoa whoa, oh what are you waiting for) 
 Say it (whoa whoa) 
 Say it (whoa whoa) 
 Say it (whoa whoa, oh what do you got in store) 
 Say it (whoa whoa)

 Say it (whoa whoa, cut off the lights and close the door) 
 Say it (whoa whoa, and ima have you feelin' so hiiiiiiiiighhh)

 Got me breakin out in cold sweats 
 You been here for 15 minuets I don't know which way to go yet 
 Girl ya so soft

 And girl I want you to enjoy yourself 
 Feelin' so good inside

 Let me take you for a lappy ride 
 And imma make ya say it (whoa whoa)
