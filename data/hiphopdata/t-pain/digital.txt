Yay, yeah

 Yay, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 It's goin' digital, yeah 
 See tonight it's goin' digital, really though 
 Really everybody in the club 'bout to feel me though 
 I came alone 'cause I'm takin' somethin' back with me, yeah 
 I left the doors up on the Lamborghini 
 So they can see me, see me everybody in the club 
 Know I got fettuccine, I can't leave home 
 Without a couple stacks on me, yeah 
 Now I got the Gucci on the shoes 
 Gucci knapsack, ice around my neck 
 How pimpin' is that? Oh c'mon girl 
 You can stack your platinum bag with me, no 
 Tonight it's goin' digital, digital 
 Digital, digital, it's goin' digital 
 Everybody know me when I walk up in the club 
 Tonight it's goin' digital, digital 
 Digital, digital, it's goin' digital 
 Everybody know me when I walk up in the club 
 When the club do's open up I'm po'in up 
 Everybody in the club know I got the frozen cup 
 I can't leave home without lookin' like Magic Don Juan, yeah 
 Now everybody know what's goin' on, my pimpin' strong 
 Listen everybody in the club is singin' my song 
 I can't leave alone 'cause all these bitches know that I'm the one, yeah 
 Now I got the green on the shoes 
 Gold Cadillac, ice around my neck 
 How pimpin' is that? Oh c'mon girl 
 Let's get it crackin' all night long 
 Tonight it's goin' digital, digital 
 Digital, digital, it's goin' digital 
 Everybody know me when I walk up in the club 
 Tonight it's goin' digital 
 Digital, digital, it's goin' digital 
 Everybody know me when I walk up in the club 
 It's goin' digital, you's don't wanna hear me though 
 She lookin' at me like she wanna piece of Nappy Boi 
 Fallin' on yo' body, hit this and be quiet 
 'Cause everybody in the club know I start the party 
 Just washed my shoes, the gator's too clean 
 Don't mess around and make me have to do the right thing 
 Aight, I'm digital and you can come to MySpace 
 Or just call me when you're down to get away 
 Tonight it's goin' digital, digital 
 Digital, digital, it's goin' digital 
 Everybody know me when I walk up in the club 
 Tonight it's goin' digital, digital 
 Digital, digital, it's goin' digital 
 Everybody know me when I walk up in the club
