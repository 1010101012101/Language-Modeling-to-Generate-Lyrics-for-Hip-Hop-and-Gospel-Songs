(Sighs) 
 Hmmmmmmm-hmmmmmmmmm 
 (Sighs) 
 Hmmmmm-hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm-hmmmmmm 
 Waves upon waves keep me down 
 And I can't get to the top 
 But when I get there I'll still be nowhere 
 'Cause I ain't find the one I love 
 And if I make it out then we should talk about 
 How you left meeeeeeeeeeeee 
 Just how you left me 
 Drownin againnnnnnnn, yeah [3X] 
 You should come see how good it would beeeeeeeee... 
 To come drown meeeeeeee 
 Oh-oh 
 Oh-oh 
 Days upon days I've been floatin 
 And you don't care if I die or not 
 But when I'm deceased I hope you will be 
 Dyin' next to me in my watery grave 
 And before we go I just, want my baby to know 
 How it feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeels to beeeee... 
 Drownin againnnnnnnn, yeah [3X] 
 You should come see, how good it would beeeeeeeee... 
 Hey yeah 
 Oh-oh [3X] 
 Drownin againnnnnnnn, in your love 
 Oh, in your love 
 Drownin againnnnnnnn 
 Oh-oh, in your love 
 Drownin in your love againnnnn 
 Oh-oh in your love 
 Drownin again in your love 
 Your love 
 Drownin again in your love [2X] 
 Ooh 
 Drownin again in your love [2X]
