 Thr33 Ringz 
 Yeah, we the class clowns jump shoot 
 3rd time around dawg. 
 If I was just to step in the ring 
 And outta the box 
 Would everybody be on my... 
 Or will I stop? 
 Say hello to my little friend, hey 
 Styles change up like lil kim face 
 I let my heat swing T-Pain so actin' homie 
 The way the beat bump niggas try to get proactiv on me, damn 
 But I done cleared the rumors 
 Everything in the open 
 Now you know how big the room is 
 Tell 'em what the truth is 
 They can't handle it 
 They think a nigga slicker than a mayonnaise sandwich 
 But they be like g-g-g-god damn it, pause 
 This nigga (??) 
 This nigga career big like some granny drawers 
 Hadda get a piano to put his grammy on 
 Yeah, ferrari, bentley, escalade, beamer, mini-coop, cut the checks, let's get paid fuck a bitch, make it rain, lamborghini 
 I gon' cover shit up like a transfer-tini 
 I give a damn if you seen me I'm a did what I does 
 I ain't doin' shit wrong like I'm kissin' my cousin 
 I know you wanna hear somethin' different. 
 Ain't you tired of his shit? 
 Ain't you curious about this shit? 
 Even if you picked this shit up from a distance at least stand still for a second and listen. 
 I'm tellin' you now it ain't a thing 
 I got the bling bling of a rapper but I sing 
 So Welcome To Thr33 Ringz.
