Man I got way to many calls 
 To let the hatin' get to me, 
 Especially when I know you ain't gone 
 Bring the shit to me, 
 So on and so forth, 
 I'm so on and so forceful, 
 Young fire kick drums, 
 Leave a print of a horse shoe, 
 Everywhere I go my shit getting played 'cause, 
 I ain't in the hood, 
 'Cause I stay in the Rave clubs, 
 Keep using them big words that I don't understand, 
 I take it as disrespect then turn your face to a cave 'cause, 
 Now that's stupid from a compo aspect, 
 But so is rollin' up weed in my published sen cheques, 
 You don't think nappy boy is the clique, 
 Or t-pain is the shit, 
 You must be snorting on some fucking anthrax, 
 Now that's old school white shit, 
 My tongue wearing skinny jeans, 
 My flow on that tight shit, 
 Love from a nigga is the only thing I might get, 
 Everything else I got if not I'll buy it, now try this... 
 I surrounded by so much hate, 
 Ain't gone let another take my place, 
 I'm sick and tired of all these lies, 
 Y'all niggers ain't felt no pain...
