It feels like, 
 I 
 Can't survive 
 Like I'm not alive 
 But you can revive, me 
 We love 
 And I won't even try 
 To act like 
 I 
 Can't say goodbye 
 'Cause you can revive, me 
 We love 
 I want you to hold me, 
 Console me 
 And I will give u, the whole me 
 'Cause you got me, 
 And I got you 
 We got love 
 Yeah 
 *Sigh* 
 Let it breathe, 
 Let it breathe 
 I want you to hold me 
 *Sigh* 
 Leeee-yeaaa-ooh 
 Yeah-ee 
 Wanna let it breathe
