Yeah... ok 
 It's ya boy Teddy Pendherassdown 
 Gerner song living it large 
 What's up shawty 
 Aye... 
 Excuse me shawty I was lookin' 
 Diggin' the way the type of tone that had you juckin' 
 But I ain't tryin' to be rude gone do what you do (but i) 
 Couldn't help but notice yo body, swingin' it hard but ain't dancin' with nobody 
 So I came over to see, would you mine dancin' with me (and why) 
 Is you suckin' up these club juices, come ride with me we can ride on the dub duces 
 I live right off of ridge road, I can show you the studio (plus i) 
 Could give love you neva knew about, that's why I can't understand how you can do without 
 But see I'm not tellin' lies, 
 You fine you a dime can't get you out my mine girl it's time to make love 
 Something that you never made before see them otha kind of brothers just gonna treat you like a hoe but I won't 
 You gotta believe me I tell you no lie 
 Just lay back and enjoy 'cause it's time to make love 
 Baby girl I said I love ya 
 All I want in this world is yo love and to hold ya 
 I don't care what the people say about about my longest relationship out of town 
 Baby girl you the star up in my sky, girl you stole my heart and I can't even lie 
 I appriciate you for changing my weather and I promise to be with you forever and ever 
 And I know that ya mama don't trust me and she hate when you tell her that you love me 
 But you know that it's gonna be all right cause superboy my heart to take flight 
 Girl you the star up in my sky, girl you stole my heart and I can't even lie 
 But see I'm not tellin' lies, 
 You fine you a dime can't get you out my mine girl it's time to make love 
 Something that you never made before see them otha kind of brothers just gonna treat you like a hoe but I won't 
 You gotta believe me I tell you no lie 
 Just lay back and enjoy 'cause it's time to make love 
 (Verse) (rap) 
 It's about that time baby 
 Look up in the sky and you will see me in the light that shine brighter then some head lights on the city 
 But we will be way more serious then boyfriend and girlfriend got my head spinnin' like a whirl wind 
 Shawty I know I made some mistakes but I can make it up by giving you this wedding cake 
 And I know it ain't know need to push and shove hold a grudge 
 The man above will let us kiss and hug 
 Cause baby it's time to make love 
 Something that you never made before see them otha kind of brothers just gonna treat you like a hoe but I won't 
 You gotta believe me I tell you no lie 
 Just lay back and enjoy 'cause it's time to make love
