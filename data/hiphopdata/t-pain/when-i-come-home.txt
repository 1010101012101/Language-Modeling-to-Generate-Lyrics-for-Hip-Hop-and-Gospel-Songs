Hey, No No No No! 
 Hey, Na Na Na 
 I can hear my baby saying my name, (Na Na Na)! 
 But I don't see my baby in time, (Na Na Na)! 
 Without you in here, It ain't the same 
 I didn't mean word I said to you last night 
 If you decide to pick up the phone, oh baby 
 I'll be waiting for you, Oh Woo 
 Tell me what's wrong, I didn't mean to ignore you 
 Don't quit me baby I can fix it baby 
 Being by myself is now my biggest fear 
 'Cause I want you here when I come back 
 There ain't nothin' I look more forward to than that 
 And I want you here when I come home 
 'Cause I can't stand to be alone, you gotta be here 
 When I come back, No 
 When I come back, Oh No 
 When I come back, No 
 When I come back, Oh No 
 Hey, Na Na Na 
 I can hear you telling to come home, (Na Na Na)! 
 But you may not even be there, (Na Na Na)! 
 We not gon make it if I'm always gone, ooh whoa 
 Plus you told me you won't going anywhere, Oh No 
 If you decide to pick up the phone, oh baby 
 I'll be waiting for you, Oh Woo 
 Tell me what's wrong, I didn't mean to ignore you 
 Don't quit me baby I can fix it baby 
 Being by myself is now my biggest fear 
 'Cause I want you here when I come back 
 There ain't nothin' I look more forward to than that 
 And I want you here when I come home 
 'Cause I can't stand to be alone, you gotta be here 
 When I come back, No 
 When I come back, Oh No 
 When I come back, No 
 When I come back, Oh No 
 Hey, Na Na Na
