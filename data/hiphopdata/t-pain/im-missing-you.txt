(Verse 1 Khrys Lawson) 
 When I met her, her smile would light up my eyes 
 When I couldn't picture us she would me visualize 
 She realized my part knew I wasn't into trickin 
 Discovered my past knew I wasn't into kissin' 
 I did my steady love she would just provide by my side 
 She just showed me how a real woman whines 
 From the moment that I seen her I knew that she had me 
 Gold fronts in her mouth she wanna stunt like her daddy 
 My lil BG, perfection in everyway 
 Beautiful in clothes breathless in lingerie 
 When I would drink she would drink too 
 And when I would leave she would text me Baby I miss you 
 The only thing in life I'd never thought I'd find 
 She's always on my mind she motivates me to grind 
 Babe, you're like my favorite season 
 That's why I'm missing you like an incompletion 
 (Chorus T-pain) 
 Baby I'll be back whenever you need me 
 You gone be so happy when you see me 
 'Cause I'm a hustler 
 But I'm ready to snuggle up witcha 
 Tell me where you at, I'll come get ya girl 
 I know you at home all alone 
 Texting my phone like ooh 
 I'm missing you 
 I'm missing you 
 Oh 
 I'm missing you 
 Ooh 
 I'm missing you 
 I'm missing youu 
 When I discovered that she loved me 
 I knew she couldn't leave 
 When she waitied for me 
 I knew it had to be 
 Something special that only my heart could see 
 Attitude and temper she is just like me 
 Bonnie and Clyde how we ride 
 My Yamaha mama 
 Through the ups and downs and the good times and drama 
 In the bed we lay up and snuggle all night 
 And I always been wrong but this feels so right 
 She don't believe in love 
 I don't believe in trust 
 But no matter what we still gon' believe in us 
 You're the angel to my hell 
 The scent to my smell 
 You deliver happiness that I receive like the mail 
 Anything I need baby girl will go get it 
 Anything I want lil mama always with it 
 And when I'm gone and she all alone at home 
 She call me and I kiss her through the phone 
 (Chorus T-Pain) 
 Baby I'll be back whenever you need me 
 You gone be so happy when you see me 
 'Cause I'm a hustler 
 But I'm ready to snuggle up witcha 
 Tell me where you at, I'll come get ya girl 
 I know you at home all alone 
 Texting my phone like ooh 
 I'm missing you 
 I'm missing you 
 Oh 
 I'm missing you 
 Ooh 
 I'm missing you 
 I'm missing youu 
 (Hook Khrys Lawson) 
 Everday she's on my mind 
 I think about her all the time 
 And while I'm on my grind I'm thinkin' of her 
 Thinkin' of her 
 And while I'm the block 
 I'm missing you 
 And while I push the drop 
 I'm missing you 
 And while I'm on the streets 
 I'm missing you 
 Girl you know I'll never leave 
 I'm missing you 
 (Chorus T-Pain) 
 Baby I'll be back whenever you need me 
 You gone be so happy when you see me 
 'Cause I'm a huslta 
 But I'm ready to snuggle up witcha 
 Tell me where you at and I'll come get ya girl 
 I know you at home all alone 
 Texting my phone like ooh 
 I'm missing you 
 I'm missing you 
 Oh 
 I'm missing you 
 Ooh 
 I'm missing you 
 I'm missing youu
