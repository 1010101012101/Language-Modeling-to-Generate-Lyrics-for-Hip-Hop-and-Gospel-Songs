It's not you, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 T-Pain, Mr. Worldwide 
 Not you, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 It's not you, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, not you 
 I know I be, I be, I be, all up in these clubs, clubs 
 Playin' with these girls, girls, travelin' around the world 
 I know I be, I be, I be, messin' with your feelin's 
 Money to the ceilin', it falls down to the floor 
 I know I'll be fist pump, fist pump, fist pumpin' like a champ 
 Yeah, the music got me amped, yeah, I'm catchin' leg cramps 
 I know I be, I be messin' us up and that's all that I do 
 So if we break up I can tell you 
 It's not you, not you, it's not you, not you it's me 
 And I know I be trippin', trippin' but I need you to listen 
 It's not you, not you, it's not you, not you, it's me 
 Even though I'm messin' up, I can't stay out of this club 
 It's not you 
 Baby, it's not you, it's me, it's not you, it's me 
 Baby, it's not you, it's me, it's not you, it's me 
 Baby, it's not you, it's me, it's not you, it's me 
 Baby, it's not you, it's me, it's the dog in me 
 I know we be, we be kissin' all in public, public 
 And girl, I love it, love it, can't get enough of it 
 But girl, lately, lately, you've been talkin' down, down 
 Keep me with a frown, frown, I can't keep you around 
 I know I be fist pump, fist pump, fist pumpin' like a pro 
 Girl, you already know, you've seen me do this before 
 I know I be messin' us up but you can't tell me what to do 
 So if we break up, I can tell you 
 It's not you, not you, it's not you, not you it's me 
 And I know I be trippin', trippin' but I need you to listen 
 It's not you, not you, it's not you, not you it's me 
 Even though I'm messin' up, I can't stay out of this club 
 It's not you, not you, it's not you, not you, it's me 
 And I know I be trippin' trippin' but I need you to listen 
 It's not you, not you, it's not you, not you it's me 
 Even though I'm messin' up, I can't stay out of this club 
 It's not you 
 Baby, it's not you it's me, it's not you, it's me 
 Baby, it's not you it's me, it's the dog in me 
 Baby, it's not you it's me, it's not you, it's me 
 Baby, it's not you it's me, woo 
 They slip, I grip, she dip, I dip 
 I hit, no text, no twitter 
 That girl's so bad that thing so thick 
 And pain, you can bet I get her 
 Even the girls wanna hit her 
 (All right) 
 So you know I'm gonna take one with her 
 (For sho') 
 More for Voli, pour it like water, let's go 
 For sho fill the club like New Orleans 
 She this, she that, her ass so fat 
 And her kitty cat's down for a doggin' 
 Mira mamita, verdad que tu esta linda, rica y donita 
 Pero la verde que quiero tu amiguita 
 It's not you, it's me, I'm sorry, darlin' 
 So if we break up, I can tell you 
 It's not you, not you, it's not you, not you, it's me 
 And I know I be trippin' trippin' but I need you to listen 
 It's not you, not you, it's not you, not you, it's me 
 Even though I'm messin' up, I can't stay out of this club 
 It's not you, not you, it's not you, not you, it's me 
 And I know I be trippin' trippin' but I need you to listen 
 It's not you, not you, it's not you, not you, it's me 
 Even though I'm messin' up, I can't stay out of this club 
 It's not you
