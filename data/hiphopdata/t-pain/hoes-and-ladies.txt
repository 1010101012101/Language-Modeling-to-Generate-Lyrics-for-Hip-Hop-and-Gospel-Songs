And you if give a f-ck that your friends stuck up 
 And she don't wanna mess up her hair 
 And if you wanna f-ck, like I wanna f-ck 
 Put your muthaf-cking hands in the air 
 I'm on five hour energy, Nuvo and Hennessy 
 So what you wanna do little baby 
 Now all my ladies in the house say hoe 
 And all my hoes in the house say lady 
 (T-Pain) 
 I'm so considerate 
 I never quit a bitch 
 No matter how many n-ggas hit 
 Or how many d-ck she licked 
 I please that clitoris 
 I give her a kiss and shit 
 When other n-ggas don't stay long enough they 
 Get the digits and split 
 If ain't nobody telling you that you are pretty 
 That's just because you are and they do not want to admit it 
 Look at all that ass, you ain't got to have titties 
 At least you part of the itty bitty titty committee really 
 You goin' let 'em style on you 
 Or you can let 'em talk 
 Hop up in this Lamborghini baby go on let 'em walk 
 Stop hanging round them stupid bitches you'd be better off 
 Them hoes dirty birds, Atlanta Hawks 
 Go on wear them granny draws 
 Matter of fact go put that dress on and don't wear any drawls and come sit on Santa Claus 
 We can take some pictures with the islands in the back drop 
 We can go to PC but you'll still be my laptop 
 And you if give a f-ck that your friends stuck up 
 And she don't wanna mess up her hair 
 And if you wanna f-ck, like I wanna f-ck 
 Put your muthaf-cking hands in the air 
 I'm on five hour energy, Nuvo and Hennessy 
 So what you wanna do little baby 
 Now all my ladies in the house say hoe 
 And all my hoes in the house say lady 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 Kiss her on the thigh make her p-ssy hole cry 
 They say numbers don't lie, lets try a 69 
 Kiss her on her lips let her p-ssy hole drip 
 She can't even walk to the bathroom she gotta skip 
 Kiss her on her cheek, make her p-ssy lips speak 
 No she pulling on my locks, kiss thou Sheek 
 Kiss her on her breasts, east and west 
 And then I go south 
 And clean up my mess 
 No stop signs, no red lights 
 She put on a show, no stage fright 
 And then I f-ck her right 
 And she say f-cking right 
 She climb on top that mountain 
 And ride that mountain bike 
 She keep it nice and wet 
 Like Armor All, she keep a close shave like barber sole 
 But all in all she's just Weezy baby 
 And you if give a f-ck that your friends stuck up 
 And she don't wanna mess up her hair 
 And if you wanna f-ck, like I wanna f-ck 
 Put your muthaf-cking hands in the air 
 I'm on five hour energy, Nuvo and Hennessy 
 So what you wanna do little baby 
 Now all my ladies in the house say hoe 
 And all my hoes in the house say lady
