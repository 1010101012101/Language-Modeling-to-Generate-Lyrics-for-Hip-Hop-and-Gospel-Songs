Let's Get It on Tonight [Rpt 4x] 
 It seems as if you just talkin' it and don't know what to do (Let's get it on) 
 I can feel you clenchin got yo body flinchin when I'm touchin you (Let's get it on) 
 Girl you know I got that good thang 
 You wouldn't understand it's a hood thang (on oon) 
 U can walk the walk but can you talk the talk is what you should sang 
 (Let's get it on tonight) 
 5ft5 got my eyes so wide and I'm holdin' that 
 (Let's get it on tonight) 
 I can see it in your eyes you want me behind so you can throw it back 
 (Let's get it on tonight) I can't even lie I got a need for your theighs nothin' wrong with that 
 (Let's get it on tonight) 
 Girl is you feelin' me, u killin' me, u feelin' me, u killin' me, u feelin' me 
 (Let's get It on tonight) 
 I ain't got to worry about cha you can handle everythang that I'm givin' u

 Even if I saw your face in a darker place I would be feelin' u
