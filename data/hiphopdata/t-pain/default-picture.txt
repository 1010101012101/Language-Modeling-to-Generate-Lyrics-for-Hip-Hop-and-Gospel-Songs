Whoa, oho, oho, whoa, 
 I got a feeling in my bones that I can't get rid off 
 But that's probably the base 
 Can't get this picture out my mind, that I've seen on Twitter 
 The one of your face 
 Girl I'm just trying to see, if you feel just a little like me 
 So DM me back, don't do me like that 
 I wanna see your pretty ass in person, girl 
 But that's just not the case 
 Plus I'm way on the other side of the earth 
 And girl plane tickets too high for me to pay 
 I'm just trying to see, if you feel just a little like me 
 So you can give me a call 
 I ain't doing nothing at all 
 Girl you keep tweeting what your doing 
 Posting pictures 
 And I feel like I need to be posted with you 
 Laid up in the bed somewhere, smearing make up, messing up your hair 
 Girl you keep making me spend my time 
 Checking on your timeline 
 You make me say whoa oho Yeah Yeah 
 I'm falling in love with your default picture. 
 You don't ever show up in my mentions girl. 
 Just say my name. 
 Must be some wrong with my eyes or my iPhone5. 
 Or is this even your page? 
 I'm just trying to see if you've got any interest in me. 
 Or am I bothering you? 
 Should I be unfollowing you? 
 And you be acting like that dude in that picture is your boyfriend... 
 But I know it's just a face, 
 Let me show you that I am better than him, 
 Just name a time and place. 
 Girl you gotta see that here's where I should be. 
 Girl you can give me a call 
 I just wanna talk to you that's all. 
 Girl you keep tweeting what your doing 
 Posting pictures 
 And I feel like I need to be posted with you 
 Laid up in the bed somewhere, smearing make up, messing up your hair 
 Girl you keep making me spend my time 
 Checking on your timeline 
 You make me say whoa oho Yeah Yeah
