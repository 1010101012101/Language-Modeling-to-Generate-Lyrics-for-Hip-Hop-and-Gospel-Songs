Hmmmm 
 I wanna dedicate this to my struggling bro 
 Keep pushin on 
 Keep pushin on 
 Yeah 
 First of the month 
 Check late 
 Got nothing to do (got nothing to do) 
 Imma roll me a blunt 
 Got drank 
 Call me a hoe or 2 
 Now I know that it sounds like I'm livin' on the edge (hmmm hmmm) 
 Homie he ain't herd the worst 
 Got the whole house runnin' on the generator 
 No good food in my fridgidator 
 And I'm late for work 
 Don't that sound bad 
 Horrible 
 No inspiration 
 No goals 
 I know it sound like 
 I wanna die 
 And I know I'm so miserable 
 But this just so happens to be 
 The best day of my life 
 Now I don't wanna confuse ya 
 I'm hurtin' on the inside 
 But I won't let you see (nah wont let you see) 
 That's why every little dollar 
 And every little penny 
 Goes to putting a outfit on me 
 'Cause imma stay fresh to def just to impress the rest 
 U know how I do it when I do it 
 Imma show you how to do it so you can do it for sumbody else 
 But I still got the house on the generator 
 No good food in my fridgidator 
 And I'm late for work 
 Don't that sound bad 
 Horrible 
 No inspiration 
 No goals 
 I know it sound like 
 I wanna die 
 And I know I'm so miserable 
 But this just so happens to be 
 The best day of my life (my life mmm) 
 Myt look drunk 
 Pik up ice 
 Drink drink drink drink drink drink 
 I'm talkin' bout that bullshit 
 I'm talkin' like a newspaper 
 I'm talkin' 'bout the newspaper full of weed 
 Like the whole thang (hahaha) 
 And imm roll it up 'n' smoke 
 Hey 
 Hit this lemme hit this 
 Imma let you think about you 
 And in the end 
 U got to let me do what I do 
 Don't that sound bad 
 Horrible 
 No inspiration 
 No goals 
 I know it sound like 
 I wanna die 
 And I know I'm so miserable 
 But this just so happens to be 
 The best day of my life
