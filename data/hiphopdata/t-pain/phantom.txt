(Verse 1 - T-Pain) 
 Yeah 
 I been in the tree house for 7 hours lookin' at your house, girl 
 Ever since you kicked me out, girl 
 That ain't me! 
 Huh 
 But who the fuck is he?! (Yeah) 
 I been watchin' y'all kissin' an' huggin' 
 Lickin' ya bellybutton 
 Touchin' and rubbin' 
 But this nigga look just like 
 me 
 ! 
 He got dreads and gold teeth! (Yeah) 
 Now, I know we just broke up (Week an' a half ago) 
 How was I to remember the 
 anniversary 
 ? (Yeah) 
 Baby, I'm sorry! (Yeah) 
 But you know... 
 (Chorus - T-Pain) 
 I can't leave y'all alone tonight 
 Ain't nothin' goin' on tonight 
 'Cause I'm the 
 Phantom 
 in your 
 Opera 
 (Yeah) 
 I'm the 
 Phantom 
 in your 
 Opera 
 (Yeah) 
 Now I can't leave y'all alone tonight 
 All the lights gon' be on tonight 
 Ooh I'm the 
 Phantom 
 in your 
 Opera 
 (Yeah) 
 He won't get none 
 You won't either 
 Till I get mine 
 Ha... 
 (Verse 2 - T-Pain) 
 Yeah 
 Ima wait until y'all get real into it 
 Just about to do it 
 The mood is set... 
 And ima mess y'all up! 
 I bet that sucks 
 To be him 
 Ima call (And hang up) 
 Call again (And hang up) 
 Hello?! (Do you like scary movies?) 
 And Ima do it again! 
 Am I scarin' yo' friend? (Yeah) 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Let's play a game (Yeah) 
 I'll be Teddy Pain (Yeah) 
 You try to do ya thing (Yeah) 
 And Ima block that cock! 
 And Ima make y'all stop 
 Yeah 
 And you know... 
 (Chorus - T-Pain)
