 Fellas grab a lady, ladies get that money 
 From the VIP to the main stage 
 Yeah, I never seen a shawty do that on the bong 
 I reach in my pocket full of two stacks, get out all 
 If you never done this, don't you feel dumb with it 
 Shawty come over to you and start gettin' it on 
 Then the song is almost done, that's so wrong 
 So I made a long lap dance song 
 I need a two for one or somethin' 
 Otherwise I need my own lap dance song 
 I only been in here for two hours 
 And all my dollar bills is gone 
 For a lap dance song 
 I need more than a minute with you 
 Before I spend a minute with you 
 Girl c'mon, don't do me wrong 
 You know what's goin' on 
 Yeah, this is the long lap dance song 
 Yeah, it's two for one tonight 
 Fellas grab a lady and ladies get that money 
 From the VIP to the main stage
