I was just chillin' in the club me and my crew buyin out the bar you know how we do 
 Then the DJ let the people know teddy pain in the house 
 Then I locked eyes with this pretty thang she waved at ya boy and said hey t-pain 
 I'm feelin' fresh got the brand new disco ball in my mouth 
 Grabbed her by the wrist had to pull her back I just wanna tell her this 
 I'm not trying to be mean and I'm not trying to be ruuuuude 
 But this is a strip club and baby I'm just almost tipped up 
 And I just want this last lap dance but only from u 
 And she started poppin' 
 She started rollin' and poppin' that pussy 
 And she turned around she leaned over 
 And asked me was I really in love with a stripper 
 And I said no but baby its possible 
 She bent over and she started poppin' mo 
 And I said shawty we can come to my crib you know jus how it iz 
 We can do this here over and over again 
 All I need is one night (one night) 
 I got 1 rubber 
 Ya day time friend and ya late night lover 
 Even though ya bodys tight 
 Baby sho you right 
 All I need is one night (one night) 
 Got her with this gurl that went to my school 
 Told her let's get up and she said that's cool 
 'Cause she been waitin 4 a long time to see what the teddy about 
 Grabbed her by the wrist whispered in her ear you can't leave me like this 
 I'm not trying to be mean and I'm not trying to be ruuuuude 
 But I know you been drinkin' (drinkin') and I kinda been thinkin' (thinkin') 
 It'll be nice if you gave me a lap dance right in my car 
 And she started poppin' 
 She started rollin' and poppin' that pussy 
 And she turned around she leaned over 
 And asked me was I really in love with a stripper 
 And I said no but baby it's possible 
 She bent over and she started poppin' mo 
 And I said shawty we can come to my crib you know jus how it iz 
 We can do this here over and over again 
 All I need is one night (one night) 
 I got 1 rubber 
 Ya day time friend and ya late night lover 
 Even though ya body's tight 
 Baby sho you right 
 All I need is one night one night one night one night
