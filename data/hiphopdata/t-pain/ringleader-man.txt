Ooh (x7) 
 Hey! 
 [Verse 1, Tallahassee-Pain] 
 We gonna have a ripping good time 
 Just hit we rewind, 
 And you can see I'm far too crazy 
 My rhythms and rhymes 
 Keep niggas in line 
 Cause now is not the time to be lazy 
 I'm the Ringleader Man 
 A cane in my hand 
 And a iced out top hat on my head 
 Ain't you tired of that wackness? 
 Sick of this wack shit 
 Wouldn't you like some of me instead? 
 The Ringleader Man 
 This is my circus 
 I'm working 
 I can flip this whole game with one hand 
 The Ringleader Man 
 I know, 
 It's a fact that you'd rather just have some of me instead 
 The Ringleader Man 
 Huh 
 The Ringleader Man 
 Huh 
 Hey! 
 This industry is my circus 
 I know that it hurts just 
 Sit back and take pain like I used to 
 And I'm trying to stop cursing 
 But I don't give a fuck 
 I'm gonna curse you with lyrical voodoo 
 I'm the Ringleader Man 
 You can't understand 
 The shit that comes out of my head 
 But you like all that wackness 
 Loving all that wack shit 
 I'd rather just say, "Fuck you!" instead 
 The Ringleader Man 
 This is my circus 
 I'm working 
 I can flip this whole game with one hand 
 The Ringleader Man 
 I know, 
 It's a fact that you'd rather just have some of me instead 
 The Ringleader Man 
 Huh 
 The Ringleader Man 
 Huh
