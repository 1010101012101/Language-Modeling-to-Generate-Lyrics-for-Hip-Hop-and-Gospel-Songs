T swizzle t swizzle t pizzle t pizzle 
 I'm like 8 foot 4, blond hair to the floor 
 You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore 
 No I ain't got a gun 
 No I never really been in a club 
 Still live with my parents 
 But I'm still a thug 
 I'm so gangsta you can find me baking cookies at night 
 You out clubbing, but I just make caramel delight 
 T swift and t-pain rappin' on the same track 
 It's a thug story tell me can you handle that 
 I HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT I had high-top NIkes 
 I had DIAMONDS IN MY MOUTH, and DIAMONDS ON MY MIC 
 By the time I woke up I was singing "I'M ON A BOOOOAAT" 
 'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper 
 Shorty I'ma make ya 
 Straight to the top, yo 
 Shorty I'ma take ya 
 You can call me T Sweezy now I'm a rap star 
 It's a thug story now tell them who you are 
 Singer turned gangster 
 You don't wanna fight me 
 Straight to the top 
 In my extra small white tee 
 T swift and t-pain all up on the same track 
 It's a thug story now can you get with that 
 What! what! I knit sweaters yo! 
 What! what! don't test me (bleep) 
 Hey hold on, hold on I didn't even say anything 
 WHAT? 
 I said "yo" 
 YUP 
 You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything 
 I didn't even swear 
 She didn"t even swear 
 Hello??
