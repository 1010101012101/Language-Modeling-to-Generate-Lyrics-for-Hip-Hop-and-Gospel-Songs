Okay 
 Woo 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Woo 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Baby sit down I got somethin' that I need to say 
 Right now before the rumor spread and make the way 
 Around town I thought I'd be your man and tell you first 
 But I know its got to hurt 
 Baby please let me explain 
 It happened all of a sudden out of control 
 She had my heart and would not let it go 
 I'm not tryin' to say that it was okay 
 But that I didn't do 
 Chrous: 
 But I gotta tell the truth 
 The truth the whole truth 
 With my right hand up 
 'Cause I don't wanna lose u 
 Its time to man up 
 I just gotta be the one to tell u 
 Baby believe me when I say 
 U don't wanna find out the harder way 
 Baby 
 Would have never seen her walking 
 Down the block I probably would have not 
 Pulled over and asked her if she need it 
 But I noticed she had make-up on her eye 
 And she started to cry 
 Said baby please explain 
 She said a man put his hands on her 
 He was out of control 
 And she really needs someone to hold 
 And not let go 
 And then she looked into my eyes just like you do 
 And I imagined she was you 
 Chrous: 
 Now I gotta tell the truth 
 The truth the whole truth 
 With my right hand up 
 'Cause I don't wanna lose u 
 Its time to man up 
 I just gotta be the one to tell u 
 Baby believe me when I say 
 U don't wanna find out the hard way 
 Baby I wish that I was a magician 
 And I could make all of this disappear 
 And baby I wish that I could go back in time 
 And trust me baby 
 We wouldn't be here 
 But you've been so good to me 
 How could I do this to you 
 And I never meant to hurt you 
 How can I prove it to you 
 I'm just trying to see what been on my mind 
 'Cause in her you 
 Chrous: 
 I gotta tell the truth 
 The truth the whole truth 
 With my right hand up 
 'Cause I don't wanna lose u 
 Its time to man up 
 I just gotta be the one to tell u 
 Baby believe me when I say 
 U don't wanna find out the hard way
