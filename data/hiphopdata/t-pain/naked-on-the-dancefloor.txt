Do your thang Shawty, 
 Do what you wanna do, 
 You can dance like this, 
 Nobody lookin' at you, 
 (Let's Go, Let's Go) 
 I feel like I can fly high as a kite, 
 If I can fly high as a kite then I'm gone (I'm gone, I'm gone) 
 I feel like I can fly high as a bird, 
 If I fly high as a bird I'm flying home 
 But first you gotta 
 Freeze, then pose 
 Freeze, then pose

 Take your clothes off, 
 Get naked on the Dancefloor (The Dancefloor) 
 Take your shoes off, 
 So you can come and dance some more (Dance some more)

 I feel like I can fix my own car, 
 If I can fix my own car, 
 Then I'm outta here (I'm gone, I'm gone)

 If I can fly like a Plane I'm flying you near, 
 But first you gotta 
 Freeze, then pose
