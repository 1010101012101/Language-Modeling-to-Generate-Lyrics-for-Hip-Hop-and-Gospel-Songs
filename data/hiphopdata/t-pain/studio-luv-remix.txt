 Yeah 
 In the studio, in the studio 
 Studio ooh, ooh 
 Girl just close your eyes, 
 And picture me playing your Spanish guitar, 
 Baby where we going, there ain't no such thing as a bad note (bad note), 
 If I could I would, stroke your body like I do my keyboard, 
 Are you ready? ready to do something you never did before.

 Weezy baby, 
 Now I'm the type of nigga that be, 
 Up in tha studio faithfully, 
 She ain't trippin', 
 She wait for me, 
 I tell her when I get a break, 
 I'm a break her, 
 Off so courageously, 
 I got dem bangin' drums, 
 She got dem alicia keyes, 
 Ooh girl lets make a beat, 
 Ooh girl you make me weak, 
 Like every time the track break, 
 Make the control room boom like an 808, 
 And if you walk your thong into this vocal booth, 
 I can guarantee I'm a make this song all about you, 
 And you know I got da drank, 
 You know I got da stank, 
 It's amazin how I think, 
 But I do so, 
 And every time I meet a girl, 
 She tell me that she sang, 
 And I say I gotta house wit a studio, 
 I'm jus tryna do my thang baby, 
 Video or audio, 
 Shawty I'm so smooth, 
 I go errywhere that water go, 
 Ooh so bad, 
 So mean, 
 Make me wrap yo ass up, 
 Like a hot 16, 
 And I promise you ain't wanna hear nobody else flow, 
 Welcome to my studio, 
 You gon love my studo.
