Never took off times to tell you lies 
 Somehow it always ends up making you cry 
 Oh the truth hurts 
 Even if you don't wanna know it 
 The truth hurts 
 ... Gonna blow it 
 'Cause we fall now... times 
 I saw the... don't even match at all 
 Only thing I know so fun 
 But I bet you are 
 All you ever did is tell me lies 
 Funny I'll catch to spend up is mine 
 Truth hurts especially when you are caught red handed 
 You can drew... goes away you planned 
 'Cause we felt in love at the wrong time 
 ... Don't even match at all 
 I saw the... don't even match at all 
 Only thing I know so fun 
 But I bet you are 
 You never took out time to tell me why wanna go 
 I remember when we said we take this ride
