Yeah 
 In the studio, in the studio 
 Studio oh, oh 
 Girl just close your eyes 
 And picture me playing your Spanish guitar 
 Baby where we going, there are no such thing as a bad note (bad note) 
 If I could I would, stroke your body like I do my keyboard 
 Are your ready? Ready to do something you never did before 
 Let's make luv in the (studio) 
 Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
 Let's make luv in the (studio) 
 Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
 Let's make luv in the... 
 I see you from the booth 
 And you remind me of a brand new saxophone (saxophone) 
 Girl I'm trying my best, but the music won't let me leave you alone 
 And your body is like a flute, I can't stop blowing on you 
 Are your ready? Ready to do something you never did before 
 Let's make luv in the (studio) 
 Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
 Let's make luv in the (studio) 
 Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
 Let's make luv in the... 
 Do you mind if I pluck upon you string for one minute? 
 And do you mind if I do some nasty things for one minute? 
 Girl! 
 If I could I would, I would stroke your body like I do my keyboard 
 Are your ready? Ready to do something you never did before 
 Let's make luv in the (studio) 
 Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
 Let's make luv in the (studio) 
 Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
 Let's make luv in the (studio) 
 Studio (studio), studio (studio) 
 (Studio), (studio), (studio)
