It's kind of like you holdin' me, strokin' me 
 Takin' control of me, never let go of me 'cause you my girl 
 It's kind of like I'm floatin' and takin' a turn 
 On the rollercoaster of love, when I see you shine like pearl 
 I know you got a man and all, but he ain't treatin' you right 
 Nine times out of ten, you won't see him tonight 
 Baby girl, I'm tellin' you, wan' smellin' you, wanna situation 
 So don't even keep me waitin' and contemplatin', come on 
 Governers square, I'm just rollin' 
 Me and Tai can't control it 
 They serve told me to look to the left 
 Jay lyrics 'em her and not her 
 Dog it ain't gettin' no worse 
 Got better (uh), a brandetta 
 When I caught my breath I said 
 Como estas Ven aqui, mami girl... 
 Como estas Ven aqui ir to my casa 
 Como estas Ven aqui, mami girl... 
 Como estas Ven aqui to my casa, casa, casa 
 Wednesday night at the moon, 
 Tryna find somethin' to get into 
 You wouldn't believe what the hell I seen 
 Drive by a Puerto Rican mama 
 Had a big thing right behind her 
 Before she spoke, she didn't think 
 That I would say... 
 Como estas? Ven aqui, mami girl... 
 Como estas? Ven aqui to my casa 
 Como estas? Ven aqui, mami girl... 
 Como estas? Ven aqui to my casa, casa 
 (Taino rap) 
 Girl, I can tell you one thing 
 I'ma put you off in my range 
 Take yo ass right 'round the 8-5-0 
 But I can do you better than that 
 Turn around, let me hug you from the back 
 I bet'cha didn't know I knew that espanol 
 Listen here 
 Como estas? Ven aqui, mami girl... 
 Como estas? Ven aqui to my casa 
 Como estas? Ven aqui, mami girl... 
 Como estas? Ven aqui to my casa, casa 
 (Taino rap)
