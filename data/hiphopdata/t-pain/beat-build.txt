Put your hands up 
 Put your hands up 
 I can't hear you, c'mon 
 Keep the party goin', 
 Shake them titties, 
 Bounce that ass baby 
 Throw your hood up, 
 Everybody go crazy 
 If they shut it down he won't be a happy dude 
 'Cause when the party stop Freaknik turn to maggot food 
 And these fagot dudes they can't stop all a y'all 
 So tear this bitch up and blame it on the alcohol 
 So put some fire on that ass and love that weed 
 And let your truck bam till you disturbin' the peace 
 Lit up your fire in the sky if you packing your heat 
 For Freaknik we gon' cause ruckus in the streets 
 Matter fact somebody gon' have to call the police 
 Tell em' I'm right here on the stage if they lookin' for me 
 Perfected my flow, I did I for us 
 Walkin' to school or catchin' the bus 
 My pants sag, 
 It's 'cause I'm so hood 
 Sweet tea ma, 
 We up to no good 
 I bought the ice cream, I bought the hot Sasha 
 I bought potato chips, but now it's Red Lobster 
 Me 'n' all my partnas, 
 We did it real big 
 I spent 200 dollars, 
 We did it real big 
 I'm talking Freaknik, I popped my first bottle 
 I met my first groupie, lap dance, to top model 
 It's big Uzi, I got a big Uzi 
 Well now the big Uzi, I got a lil' Uzi 
 I wanna big name, I wanna big chain 
 Put my face on it, 
 They think I'm insane 
 But we rule the world, 
 We came a long way 
 I thought we'd never make, 
 Man we came a long way 
 Oh I, people do it for you, and you, and you 
 I can hear your voice come through, through, through 
 They don't want us to do we do, do, do 
 That's why we do it, 
 That's why we do it (Girl) 
 That's why we do it, 
 That's why we do it 
 That's why we do it, 
 That's why we do it 
 I'm a keep on goin' for you, and you, and you 
 That's how we do it, 
 That's how we do it 
 That's how we do it 
 That's why we do it 
 That's why we do it 
 That's why we do it
