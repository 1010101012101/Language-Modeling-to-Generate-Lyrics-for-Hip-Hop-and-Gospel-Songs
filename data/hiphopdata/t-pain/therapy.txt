T-Pain: 
 Ah, take a sip of this eh, let's go 
 I want you to feel this beat, baby 
 I'm not tired, let's go, feel it. 
 T-Pain: 
 Listen, what's up? 
 This ain't the way I wanted it to end 
 But I got to go, gotta get missin' 
 You ain't gotta kick me out 
 I'll get out my own house 
 But you still need to get your shit together, girl. 
 T-Pain: 
 What do I do? What do I say? 
 Gotta get us back to the way 
 That we used to be back in the day. 
 Who do I call to talk to? 
 Shawty, you ain't gotta be scared of me 
 All we need is Therapy. 
 Like 1 2 3 4 
 Get the hell up out my door

 I don't need your sex, I'll masturbate

 You can go to hell all I care, yeah.

 Can't handle the pressure of you, yeah yeah 
 Can't do it, shawty, can't deal with you, baby 
 Can't handle the pressure of you, yeah yeah. 
 Listen, what's up? 
 I know you ain't used to us bein' friends 
 But I got to go, no more kissin' 
 You ain't gotta go away 
 But I know I cannot stay 
 'Cause you still gotta get your shit together, girl. 
 What do I do? What do I say? 
 Gotta get us back to the way 
 We used to be back in the day 
 Who do I call to talk to?

 All we need is Therapy.

 Kanye West: 
 Ooh, you too much pressure doll 
 You gonna raise my cholesterol 
 I gotta lower the phone decibels 
 Just to talk, just a thought 
 I'm a get a girl with a ass just as soft 
 You swear man dolls like reservoir 
 And I was Mr. Pink. 
 Remember those nights on the kitchen sink? 
 I was chokin' you in a good way, good way 
 Now we in the streets & I'm chokin' you in a hood way 
 When the cops come what I could say 
 You know how all that gossip is 
 Next morning Basta Perez 
 Any girl I take out, media take her 
 I need a break now 
 Before I break now. 
 T-Pain: 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. 
 Kanye West: 
 Show me your Janet Jackson's if you nasty 
 You said you want to cut my nuts off like Jessy Jackson, classy. 
 Ooh, why she say that? Ouch 
 Bitch, give me back my couch 
 And that same couch cashed in 
 Now listen to T-Pain ass sing. 
 T-Pain:
