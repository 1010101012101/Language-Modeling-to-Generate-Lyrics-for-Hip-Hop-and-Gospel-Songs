Yeah, get it in the morning, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 'Cause I'm so serious, 
 You get it in the morning 
 'Cause I'm so serious 
 So serious man 
 Listen up if you a true hustler man for real 
 You gonna bounce back if you got get back skills 
 Fuck all that weeping and whining and crying piss on a bitch 
 I'ma make it do what it do get out and get my grits 
 I'm on that graveyard shift my water feel pass me 
 Hustlin' tryin' to stay focused got a twenty four hour notice on my door 
 Business is slow, I speak the truth will pressure out the roof 
 A long way from being recession proof 
 I'm going through 
 I ain't trying to be a deadbeat dad 
 I want my kids to have a better life than I had 
 My cellular off, need some more minutes over my limit 
 Had the money but bought ounce of weed thought I could flip it 
 Man I'm niggorant 'cause that's what some of us black folks do 
 Instead of payin' a bill we gonna buy the new Jordan shoe 
 Milk and diapers and baby wipes cost an arm and a leg 
 A breast of wing and a thigh 
 Hustle trying to get by 
 Hey don't underestimate me, 
 A couple of days is all is gonna take me 
 'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that 
 I drop it off and it come right back 
 I get it in the morning 
 Don't underestimate me, 
 A couple of days is all is gonna take me 
 'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that 
 I drop it off and it come right back 
 I get it in the morning 
 I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired of being broke 
 I'm sick of this sequel 
 Man I swear I hate reportin' to them people bra' I'm down on my luck 
 Ain't got a buck to my name, dirty testing pissing in a cup, what the fuck 
 They found weed in my system, I told my girl I was quitting 
 They sent me back to San Quentin for ninety days 
 Did my time and got out, 
 Now I'm in the unemployment line trying to figure shit out 
 But the penal system got me by the necks haha 
 With my troubled past I can't even get me a job 
 My partner rap he got his own record label they doing their thang 
 If I holler at him maybe he can shoot me some change 
 Plus I'm a loyal nigger man, I learn quick bro I ain't stupid 
 All you gotta do is show me one time and I can do it 
 My fellow put a hustle under his wang, show me the game 
 Now I'm doing my thang 
 Hey don't underestimate me, 
 A couple of days is all is gonna take me 
 'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that 
 I drop it off and it come right back 
 I get it in the morning 
 Don't underestimate me, 
 A couple of days is all is gonna take me 
 'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that 
 I drop it off and it come right back 
 I get it in the morning 
 I'm trying to stay out of trouble and triple double quadruple 
 This little change that I got 
 By throwing a few concerts 
 But I'm not too sure if I'm ready to spend this mill' 
 The reason why is rap shows don't always go that well 
 Uh, and the chances are that I probably won't recoup 
 So I'ma take this loot and book some old school R'n'B soul groups 
 That way the value insurance won't be that high 
 And plus I'm minimizing the chances of somebody dying, that's right 
 I got a homie that work at the toll bridge 
 He make good money, plus he get benefits 
 He been hollering at me never the lesson 
 Trying to get a nigger a job there which is a blessing 
 But I don't think the homie really understand 
 I am an entrepreneur man I ain't working for no white man 
 Attitude of a hood boy, all my life I've been running from the Elorys I'm serious 
 Hey don't underestimate me, 
 A couple of days is all is gonna take me 
 'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that 
 I drop it off and it come right back 
 I get it in the morning 
 Don't underestimate me, 
 A couple of days is all is gonna take me 
 'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that 
 I drop it off and it come right back 
 I get it in the morning.
