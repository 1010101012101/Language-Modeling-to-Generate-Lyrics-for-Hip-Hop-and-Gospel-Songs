 I'm fresh out of a scuffle, I'm already, fired up 
 It's probably the worst time for me to go out to da club 
 But I don't give a Fuck, see a pussy nigga make 'em give it up 
 Punch him in his stomach make him throw all of his liquor up 
 I'm pissed enough to do it, I'm finna do it on a nigga 
 I'm thinkin' to myself how close can you get to a nigga 
 But I'm already beside him, take a step behind him 
 I blind sight his ass, sit back and laugh and cause Motha fucka I'm Mad 
 I'm about to kick sombody' ass 
 I done had a bad day I need somethin' to make me laugh 
 'Cause I'm mad, If you missed the club nigga you best to be glad 
 That would have been you ass, Motha Fucka I'm mad
