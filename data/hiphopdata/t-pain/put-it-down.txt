(Talking) 
 Hey what's up girl what took you so long stop playing 
 Who? Don't worry about if I carry 'em around if I didn't have one you would mad Don't worry about 
 That I got that 
 T-pain! 
 Baby give me a reason so I can touch it how I want to 
 And make love to you how them other lame niggaz want to 
 Gone girl what you gone do 
 On my nappy head you can pull with my nappy dreads if you want to 
 Shawty I'ma put it on you 
 And make you think that you the girl I was singing all my songs to 
 You got me thinking me and you went to drinking and sippin on that patron we done been got it on boo 
 But for now we just sit and chill 
 You never had love making like this for real 
 Come on baby its just appeal 
 Now take it slow and let me take it down low 
 Lets go lets go 
 So you know its about to go down now 
 Speed it up baby can't slow down now 
 Tell ya closet freak she can come out now 
 Why you think they call me teddy penderassdown 
 And now I know you didn't expect me to go low 
 Now you know 
 From the top to bottom and now that I got you 
 I'ma stick, stick, stick, stick, ooh (x2) 
 And now I know you didn't expect me to just turn you round spread it out and put it down 
 From the top to the bottom and now that I got you 
 I'ma stick, stick, stick, stick, ooh (x2) 
 You got a nigga on swoll like a T-pain show in Tallahassee 
 Never put that ass on hold I'm to nasty 
 Don't never underestimated T-pain 
 You should have known when I was biting on you belly button chain 
 That you are about to receive some of that guitar tongue 
 Tryna tell me like you don't want none 
 Tryna sit up in the bed tryna act all calm 
 Acting like it ain't good tryna hold that cum 
 But you know that I'm the best 
 You kow you teddiverset 
 It's the first ten minutes you ain't felt shit yet 
 I got the whips, I got the chain, I got the handcuffs to 
 But ain't none of that for me I'm about to handcuff you 
 That's the freaky shit I keep on skeeting shit 
 And making licky leaking shit 
 That take her ass back to the church preacher and deacon shit 
 I'm beating it lets try computer love I keep deleting it 
 I'm fucking under the dresser the bedroom floor and the sheets and shit now whatt 
 (Break Down) 
 What you doing 
 Take ya pants off 
 Not that fast do it slower 
 You gone ruin the mood 
 Move ya hand let me see 
 Baby girl let a nigga slide in them guts 
 My little man wanna hide them guts 
 I'ma take my (Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick) time with them guts 
 And baby girl when I'm in them guts 
 You ain't gotta worry bout ya man cause 
 I bet he can't do it like me (nope, nope) (x2) 
 (Chorus till it fades)
