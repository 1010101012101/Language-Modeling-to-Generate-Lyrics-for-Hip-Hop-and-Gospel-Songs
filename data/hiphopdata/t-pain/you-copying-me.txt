Here's a little story that I got to tell 
 About a young mother fucker that went through hell 
 He started up in Tallahassee Florida 
 Hoping that somebody would save him from the border 
 He started making beats for the local stacking bread 
 And joined up with a click called the nappy headz 
 The money came slow but the hate came quick 
 Talking behind his back like Pain ain't shit 
 He was going out of town just to put it on stage 
 Blind to the fact that he wouldn't get laid 
 Slept in car, clothes in the backseat 
 20 dollars to get them hoes in the back seat 
 Got tired of that then he set some goals 
 Hoping that his rap shit would get him to the get-to-go 
 Never thinking what he bout to be then 6 years later everybody copying me 
 You copy me? 
 What? You copy me? 
 What? You copy me? 
 What? You copy me? 
 What? You copy me? 
 One fateful day he said fuck it 
 Hoped in the Chevrolet bucket Then he went to Micky D's got a application no worry to just to where this rap will take him so he gave up took the paper home 
 4 dollars in an hour that's pay for hoe 
 But he ain't to grown 
 So he got no bills no car just enough to make it home 
 Then ring ring on a mobile phone area code say 404 
 Oh yo this Akon what up nigga Man, the shit sounds good 
 Shut up nigga 
 Click! 
 Just leave me the fuck alone 
 And somebody better quit playing on my fucking phone 
 And then he said Na this 
 What I am about to do have everybody copy you you see me na? 
 You copy me? 
 What? You copy me? 
 What? You copy me? 
 What? You copy me? 
 What? You copy me? 
 2 10's in the bucket man fuck it I'm taking my black ass to the ATL 
 And I'm a make it there in 3 in a half hours even if I gotta go through hell 
 Na I can't tell if this is the kind of choice I should be making all by myself 
 But I am gonna commit suicide if I see another untalented nigga on the best buy shelf 
 Well hooked up with Akon and bobocar sat down at a pizza palor Its kinda hard try to explain who you are 
 When you showed up getting off the marter 
 So I show the niggas a couple of DVD's Cds some of the shit I did on TV 
 'Cause I suked at basketball but this is way better after all 
 See me now nigga 
 You copy me? 
 What? You copy me? 
 What? You copy me? 
 What? You copy me? 
 What? You copy me?
