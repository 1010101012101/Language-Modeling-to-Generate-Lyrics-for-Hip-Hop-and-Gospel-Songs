Yeah 
 We've been in this situation 
 Like once or twice 
 Before now 
 And I liked it cause you liked it 
 Yeah 
 Sweet anticipation 
 So very nice 
 But how? 
 Do we fight it? 
 No fighting 
 What we feel is so, 
 Natural 
 We pretty much, 
 Have to go, 
 With the flow (The flow) 
 Of your body 
 Shawty 
 We can do whatever you, 
 Want to do tonight 
 And somehow I know what it is 
 And I'm so excited 
 'Cause if I do it, 
 To you 
 Then you got to do it, 
 To me 
 And if we do what I think we gonna do 
 Shawty that'd be fucking sweet 
 Uh 
 And baby you know it 
 You know you know it 
 I know you know it 
 Ooh 
 Yeah 
 Let me do your dissertation 
 I know everything, 
 There is to know 
 And I'd be delighted, 
 To write it 
 Yeah 
 Bottom line: you're just the greatest 
 Have you ever heard, 
 Of a love TKO? 
 Well girl you're Mike Tyson, 
 And I like it 
 And I must be psychic 
 'Cause I knew what you were gonna do right before you did it 
 Right when I got in it, I was free 
 Yeah 
 But I'ma be quiet 
 You know I love making love to you-it's like a new dimension 
 When you get to kissing on me 
 Cause you know if I do it to you 
 You know you got to do it, 
 To me 
 And if we do what I think we gonna do 
 Baby that'd be fucking sweet 
 Ooh 
 And I know you know it 
 You know it 
 I know you know it 
 Whew 
 Yeah
