The Streets is all I know how can I go, 
 From a G to a Gent. 
 They want me to change my walk, my talk, my style, 
 From a G to a Gent. 
 How do I rep my hood if I go, 
 From a G to a Gent. 
 They wanna transform my gangster, 
 From a G to a Gent. 
 From the playground straight to the corner, 
 Wake up, wash up, get dressed, then hit the street. 
 When my pants sag low, 
 Fresh ones, ain't nobody steppin on ma toes, 
 Everybody talkin' bout homie you digin yourself an early grave. 
 Y'all don't know what I've been through, so why y'all shittin on me (why y'all shittin on me), 
 I'll do what I gotta do so my fam can eat. 
 I'm so gangster (so gangster), 
 I gotta be ('cause I gotta be), 
 I'll be a gentleman eventually (eventually) 
 I'm so gangster, I'm so hood with it, 
 I gotta be, a gentleman, eventually 
 But for now you can call me gangster 
 All day, everyday (I gotta be) 
 It's written all ova ma face (a gentleman) 
 No matter what a hater say (eventually)
