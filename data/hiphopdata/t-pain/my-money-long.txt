T-pizzle, NAPPY BOY, T-pizzle, NAPPY BOY 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, I will now go in and refuse to come out 
 I say that I'm not the best but I have a lil somethin' lets go in together, ok 
 (Verse One) 
 PIZZLE, I'm pissed off a lil bit 
 I'm bout to show these niggas how awful it'll get 
 Somebody call the auto tune office real quick 
 And tell 'em Teddy Pain done went off in the bitch (went of in this bitch ?) 
 I'm just gettin' warmed up 
 I don't speak yo folk language I'm a foreigner 
 I'm from Moneyville, Cash Avenue, Dolla Bill street bitch that's why I gotta attitude 
 I came to express my inner most 
 My niggas tryna eat, so I'm the Nappy Boy dinner host (eat it up nigga) 
 Get ready for the muthafuckin entree 
 Niggas thought I reached my peak like Dante 
 Haha cause ain't no mountain high enough 
 You think you be fly but you see I'm on some flier stuff 
 Cutlet so tall feel like I need to higher a 
 Private jet pilot just to drive it down the highway uh 
 I know you don't believe it, even though you see it 
 Wonder how we get this paper long 
 Act hard if you need it 
 You better believe it 
 We still gettin' form my first song 
 My money long (money-my money long) 
 My money long (money-my money long) 
 My money long (money-my money long) 
 I put on 
 I went and got some pills from the dentist man (man) 
 And ended up in the backseat of a minivan (van) 
 He said take ten of these (these) 
 And ten minutes later I was like I CANT SEE ANYTHING 
 Niggas just wanna fu-un, get drunk and show up to Iraq wit one gun 
 Speakin' Arabian, bitch I'm bout to bring the heat wave again 
 Bust illyrical nuts in ya face again 
 I'm the R&B game's porn star bitch 
 Just call me the auto tune Mr. Marcus 
 I been the shit, you just a fart bitch 
 So fall off like me on a golf kart bitch 
 You wanna start shit, I'll be right here 
 5 years in the game, 6 million dolla crib 
 If I get it how I leave, wait a minute I'd actually get it pretty good 
 You muthafuckas should see where the fuck I live I GOT... 
 I know you don't believe it, even though you see it 
 Wonder how we get this paper long 
 Act hard if you need it 
 You better believe it 
 We still gettin' form my first song 
 My money long (money-my money long) 
 My money long (money-my money long) 
 My money long (money-my money long) 
 I put on 
 Drop-top Bentley, Drop-head fainter 
 32 cars, how the fuck could you blame em 
 Every Chevrolet got more 12's in the anus 
 My flow game sick like Greg Louganus 
 Go 'head and call me an asshole 
 I'm the frog prince, niggas is tadpoles 
 My pants got social anxiety, the pockets keep thinkin' people callin them fatso (FATSO) 
 Now think about that one... all right I'm back son 
 Party full of pretty girls but I want the fat one 
 Nuvo got 'em lookin' like two Toni Braxton's 
 All these red cars got me lookin' like a straight blood 
 So they lookin' at me funny every time I say 'cause (SUP CUZ) 
 But they don't got they click and I do, we roll swoll like them Spartans nigga 
 Ah-ooh!
