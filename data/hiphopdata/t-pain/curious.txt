spoken: 
 Yeah 
 Fizzo, Fizzo 
 This right here is for the whole West Coast 
 I see you [indistinct name] 
 (Hook: T-Pain) 
 I know you're curious (ooh) 
 You're ready for a new lifestyle 
 I know you're curious (ooh) 
 You wanna get in my background 
 I know you're curious baby (oh) 
 Watch me pop my collar 
 I know you're curious baby 
 Let's roll, let's go (ooh- whoa) 
 At any time you can catch me in that 55 
 Sittin' low when I roll, getting plenty shine 
 At home or on the road I got plenty dimes 
 Plus the boy game so cold call it winter time 
 We can hit Melrose, you can pick a line 
 Pop tags, 20 bags, I ain't have to spend a dime 
 Spend all my time flippin dimes 
 In that 745 man, I call the whip dinner time 
 Not that long ago they thought I lost it 
 Till the boy came back flossin 
 Parked that Aston Martin 
 At the Slauson 
 Then he got out walkin', yeah 
 You wanna come through more than often 
 'Cause the chain so froze got you coughin 
 I was young then, now I'm bossin 
 Ma, I got a crib that you'll get lost in 
 Mami, I'm so fly, well so they say 
 Even in Saint Tropez, he so LA 
 No hyphy, don't go dumb 
 Minus the Chucks 
 Still got a swag like chuuch 
 And I don't do much 
 Brought the Coup out 'cause the Phantom's too much 
 In that new blue truck 
 Man, they haters can't stand I'm too much 
 Oh, this right here, I spent five on it 
 I got a 6-4, it just got a 5 on it 
 I just get it when I want it 
 'Cause it's the next big thing just as long as I'm on it 
 So I have 5 on it 
 Look, so much money in the bank I could buy 5 of 'em 
 Or maybe like 9 of 'em 
 Nah, man, like 99 of 'em 
 Damn, you wanna know how the boy do that 
 Cruise down the Shaw wit the top blew back 
 From the front to the back 
 In like 3 seconds flat 
 In the blink of an eye 
 How the top do that? 
 I don't know how the top do that 
 But this is how it goes when you drop two stacks 
 Let one go, then you cop two back 
 And the presidential tents make the cops too mad 
 Ah, well too bad 
 Yellow man, pony tail 
 Won't you tell 'em who's that 
 It's the F-I 
 Boy from the West Side 
 Boy so blessed like which side is his best side 
 Getting more rides than a test drive 
 Girlies wanna know how high is the sex drive 
 Like they say, the sky's the limit 
 So until we get that high, I'm in it
