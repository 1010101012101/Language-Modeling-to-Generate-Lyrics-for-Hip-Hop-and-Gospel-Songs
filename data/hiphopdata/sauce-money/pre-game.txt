(Sauce money) 
 I lay my gun fine, ideas be as bright as the sunshine 
 Shook the rap game with just one line 
 When me and my niggaz combine, all day, you know what? 
 Sometimes, I run with mad niggaz who done time 
 Hit you with eight, from one nine, now you showin the vein 
 My shells is like information, go in your brain 
 Holdin' my slug, before you squeeze 'em show 'em the love 
 Burn your fingertips so throw 'em a glove, understand me 
 Before my album drop, cop the grammy, uncanny 
 Bought my first role' from manny 
 Dirty burners my crew never hand me, nigga we family 
 You not, get shot, get caught slippin like dexter manley 
 With at least ten lead, spray right, paint your skin red 
 Damn we, all the shit you can't be 
 We big time, you small time, real small like how an ant be 
 Marcy, bust a shot for metcalf, tilo and danny 
 Peace to the bureils, cut wop and stanley 
 Boom moet and bow, my whole set is wild 
 Past threats, frontin flash singles and that's bent 
 Fuck a bitch, you know the drill 
 Cut a chick or a suck a dick 
 (Jay-z) 
 Jigga, what the fuck? 
 As a youth explosively, clappin off the roof 
 Shootin guard like kobe, raised up slay smears and bo'e 
 Back then, gil was my codiene, Spanish jose 
 Showed me how to get the money niggaz owed me 
 Fast forward, no kids, six cars and three role's 
 Two cribs, trips to cuba, sippin on uba 
 Got rap in a stupor, first to clap your group up 
 From the range with the ski rack, or six with the ruger 
 Shit, I light the motherfuckin soundproof booth up 
 New shit, y'all say the same shit like you're looped up 
 Your rap's all lazy, jigga the black scorcese 
 What your album lack is more jay-z 
 Code name: jay-hovah, all praise me 
 Y'all don't paint pictures, y'all all trace me 
 You've yet to see the day when my squad be done 
 I represent that shit nigga, marcy son, what?
