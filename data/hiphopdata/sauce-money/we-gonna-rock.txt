Never send a boy to do a man's job 
 You know? 
 I think we got away from what the fuck this is all about 
 We forgot - how to spit 
 Muthafuckas is makin' all these crazy-ass fuckin' records 
 Stop puttin' your dirty laundry out in the street, muthafucka 
 Follow me now 
 Fuck with me 
 Sammy sosa slugger, hip-hop nigga, touch 'em all 
 Some cute, but suck 'em all, I say fuck 'em all 
 Eat a dick too, soloist choose another route 
 G.h. form now, go and break my brother out 
 Henny out the bottle, nigga, eyes low in the truck 
 Nothin' but that good smoke, hydro in the dutch 
 Ain't no probably, sauce money, fool, got to be 
 Chicken eggs grits, California, call it oscar e. 
 Everything I spit hot, baby boy, you're kiddin me? 
 Hit flex with it, stretch with it, then mr. cee 
 Marley marl Sunday night, can't forget kid capri 
 Hit the turnpike where all my niggas down in philly be 
 Just passin through, son, still many guns to cock 
 30 miles from the bridge where anyone can cop 
 Chillin' at my bitch crib, sip plenty rum and scotch 
 Put it in the air for them niggas biggie, pun and pac 
 Haters frontin in the club 
 Real gees show us love 
 Bust slugs for my nigga 
 (We gonna rock) 
 Anywhere we do shows 
 Come through, two hoes 
 Killers with new flows, playa 
 (We gonna rock) 
 Even when eyes low from hydro 
 Can't another brother cock-block my flow 
 (We gonna rock) 
 Can't stop our ones 
 Can't block our guns 
 Get your triggers 
 And squeeze for these faculty niggas 
 Haters hate me 'cause I'm a big nigga with mass appeal 
 They can suck a dick with ghonorrhea and that's for real 
 Ain't no secrets, muthafuckas know I might clap the steel 
 Be ready any given time, I'm like grab the wheel 
 Let the window down slow, kid just bought the farm 
 Two chicks in a yugo, damn, it's a false alarm 
 Not on this joint, sauce usually calm with the grammar 
 But right now I'm like baking soda, armed with a hammer 
 Summertime comin', now they wonder what I drive next 
 Represent for big niggas, 3-4-5-x 
 Wide body jeeps, little dimes puff the herb slow 
 Know the drill, bubblegum, rubbers in the 3rd row 
 Suv tinted out, frontin on the hands-free 
 Real gees happy for me, haters like 'it can't be' 
 Fighter and a lover, worst enemy or your brother 
 Just don't forget to call me dad too 'cause I'm a motherfucker 
 I know bitches who love sauce for the dicko, straight gorilla 
 Fatally, more than likely take at least eight to kill a- 
 Ddicted to my flow, doggy style ain't the way I make my scrilla 
 [Name], [name], [name], [name], those my niggas 
 Hit the club half-cocked, niggas shoulda knew me better 
 Jim star dillinger, that's under my gucci sweater 
 Through the crowd thugged out, took my stance and I spit 
 Screamed on this one chick like, bitch, dance to my shit 
 Part the club with elbows, bump a nigga, love that 
 Nigga read my eyes and it said 'step the fuck back' 
 This gorilla hill shit, we don't give two fucks 
 On gorilla hill, kid, you tryin' to do too much 
 Must've had a sixth sense, how he knew I clutch chrome? 
 Probably this a big bitch, front and left his nuts home 
 Fuck that weak gotti shit, nigga, let your shotie spit 
 Sauce muthafuckin, get your punk-ass body whipped 
 Welcome to gorilla hill
