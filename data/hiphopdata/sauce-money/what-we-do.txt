 (Sauce money) 
 I like to do 20 wild chicks scoping my whip 
 Do shows across the country get dough for my shit 
 Lookin' in the face of rappers hopping I quit 
 Still spit the fly shit to keep them grosing my hits 
 I like to neva eva let my tongue touch in the sex 
 Like to excersice one week say fuck it the next 
 Like to write four whole songs three skits a day 
 Talk shit with tyrina, and do hits with j 
 I like to write for other people keep 'em lovin' a nigga 
 On the low love the dough between my publish and bigga 
 Is it wroth a million yet that's what they say now 
 Long distance California let me call j brown 
 Hear the story off of a cappa who was first described 
 Do one for money sauce keep thirst alive 
 Like the shit filled with fam when I invent that hit 
 Like to scream rocafella when and repersent that shit 
 Chorus sauce money 
 Just, some of things that we like to do 
 Pretty sure some things you like to do 
 With a wooden chair a dolo or with your crew 
 Just, some of things that we like to do 
 Pretty sure some things you like to do 
 With a wooden chair a dolo or with your crew 
 What it is is what is is this is what we do

 Like they drink infront of the heat and take off the skirt 
 Like when chicks try to make it seam to provoke me the hitter 
 Handle that diplomatic and try to fuck their sister

 Like to go gold with you and hold my guns on the stoop 
 Like to shoot whack rappers and get away with the crime

 All my street niggas who used to rock their timbs untied
