What you think you like me? you ain't like me motherfucker 
 You a punk 
 I been with made people, connected people 
 Who you been with? chain snatching, jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers 
 Why don't you go get lost 
 Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or something 
 (Jay-z) 
 You're now tuned into the greatest 
 Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us 
 Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see em, try to be em 
 Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th wonder 
 Locked rap for trey summers, poker faces with the aces under 
 Face one up, to take over, the break's over 
 Nigga I'm the god MC, me, jay-hovah 
 Shit knocking, almost a crime, get Cochran 
 Banging to the hearse where my doctors hand 
 Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away 
 They want to see me pay, motherfuckers better ride 
 If they try to plant, under the seat of my car 
 Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes 
 Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper 
 Rep ya game pros 
 (Wais) 
 We celebrate this, while you sitting back screaming you hate this 
 Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix 
 Spitting sperm inside of latex 
 You get, no respect like a child rapist 
 Delegate this, men just giving face lifts 
 Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus 
 Nor Caesar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases 
 Informants, heating the spot up like global warming 
 Who start shit? my style is laced with arsenic 
 Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless 
 I know you want to see me wasted 
 You call the order, I'll be in hell 
 Team roc sweater and ice water 
 Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel 
 Blazing in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals 
 Y'all niggas is local but that's evident 
 I'm resident evil, moving like? 
 (Memphis Bleek) 
 Millionaire that flow like water, rap niggas running 
 I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya 
 Point the mac at yeah, niggas caught up 
 Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture 
 Like a compound fracture, can't fuck with it 
 For the love of sex money and drugs 
 Affiliated with the sets tecs honies and thugs 
 Let the four power, rain on niggas like a spring shower 
 And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us 
 If you was looking you found us 
 Moving with speed, tried to play superman 
 Ended up like Chris Reeves 
 Paraplegic, precise minds like the Pharaoh's of Egypt 
 Shot through a barrel niggas narrowly weaved it 
 Keeping my team top seeded with the sweet 16's 
 Bulging out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded 
 Holding, ? shots with you like a secret 
 It's like a story never told, but believe it 
 (Sauce Money) 
 Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker 
 Lick a round, niggas hit the ground like Sanka 
 I got ya screw face in forty-two ways, aim better 
 Than toothpaste, Jerry McGuire 
 "Show me the money" like clue tapes 
 Run up in your spot with a few eights, zoning 
 Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin 
 Four shots spin ya like chrome rims 
 Put a part right through your dome like the omen, foaming 
 White sheets got ya wrapped like a roman 
 Back in new york, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny 
 Niggas is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed 
 Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon 
 Heat-seeking, grill hunting, still fronting? 
 Keep squeezing, fuck it, I leave the whole street wheezing 
 No *motherfuckers* hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail 
 Got 'em scared to drop like soap in jail 
 (Jay-Z) 
 Yeah, there you have it 
 Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever 
 Never disrespect this thing of ours 
 Roc-a-fella family
