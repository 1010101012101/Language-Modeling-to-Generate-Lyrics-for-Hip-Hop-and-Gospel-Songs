Y'all muthafuckas is sadly mistaken 
 I think - 
 I don't really think y'all understand 
 What it is that I exactly do 
 I make joints for the radio 
 And all that, youknowmsayin? 
 But this is my shit right here, yo 
 We can just get right to it 
 Hope they can fuck with it 
 I can make joints all day, never touch a average 
 Sauce, hot shit, ain't nothin' but a marriage 
 Skills that I possess, niggas die to have it 
 Hip-hop muthafucka, I rap like a savage 
 Automatics for faggots who brag about fabrics 
 Mad blood on your carriage, no love for you addict 
 I roast all y'all niggas, homicide closed, die most 
 It's suicide fuckin' with me, try toast 
 Fuck cats talkin' first class but fly coach 
 The laugh is over, Mr. Half-a-Soda 
 You're at your quota, I'm halfway to Minnesota 
 The seat 1a sippin a ice cold ??Momossa?? 
 Never sober, when I awake I can make a wish 
 Head from the bitch servant or steak and fish 
 Arouse my meat till I'm sound asleep 
 Gettin' brain surgery at 33'000 feet 
 A nigga knocked out till I hit the ground and creeped 
 Limo, five star hotel and a suite 
 Once earnin I come turnin' for cunt squirmin 
 Bitches who front learnin, yearnin to keep the blunt burnin
