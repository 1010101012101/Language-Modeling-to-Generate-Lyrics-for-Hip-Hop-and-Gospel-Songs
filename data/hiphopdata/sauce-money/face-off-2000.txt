Intro: 2000, and it goes like. (uh huh, yeah yeah) 
 Chorus: this goes out to my brooklyn crew 
 Lay my game flat, what you wanna do 
 Talk all night, are we gonna screw? 
 I'm talking 'bout me and you 
 Verse one: sauce money 
 I like to push up on chicks like it's the last record 
 Take 'em to the telly get buck passed naked 
 Let 'em feel the power, lick 'em if it don't taste sour 
 Hit 'em in the shower for an hour 
 Give 'em that feeling, sauce money for real and 
 Let her get on top if there's mirrors on the ceiling 
 Hit her so right that she wanna throw rice 
 My device makes her say damn, that nigga's nice! 
 Know I got wifey lay my cards when I pivot 
 Pass your seven digits if you're with it 
 Sauce wanna give you the option for the boot knockin' 
 Nine times outta ten it's on and poppin' 
 Ain't no stopping victory's in the air 
 Bring a friend next time let's do it again 
 Bring your whole crew if you see through me 
 And we can meet on the bqe 
 And it goes like 
 Verse two: sauce money, jay-z 
 Sauce money: 
 Had this bitch bragging, 
 Sauce had his tongue between my thighs lally-gaggin; 
 Huh, could you imagine 
 Shaking your tail just like a dragon here comes my worse flame 
 In the morning hot 97 the first thing 
 (Deny it) hell yeah y'all don't buy it 
 I don't eat no kind of fish if you can't fry it 
 But who knows maybe one day I'll try it 
 But for now slow down too much lip is killin' your diet 
 Jay-z: 
 Can I get it what - get it wet 
 When he hit it first can I get it next, shit you the best 
 It ain't wack to be with both of us, mami actually 
 I'm eddie kane jr., that nigga me! 
 You want me to feel what he feel when it's tight 
 And I know, he don't be doing it right 
 But it gets no liver than this, never lie on our dicks 
 Shit, we got nigga's rides on our wrists 
 Play your cards right you'll be driving the 6 
 Shopping all day hoppin' out in the dist. 
 Popping the crist., shit hoppin' outta your wrist 
 Popping your shit, new york's hottest bitch 
 >From the ghetto to the stilletto's 
 But you gotta do it two times like an echo, y'all feelin' that 
 This is how we run it down the line 
 Nigga sauce goes first jigga next to rhyme 
 Verse three: jay-z, sauce money 
 Jay-z 
 I see you got a lot to get off your chest 
 Coat, blouse, bra-don't talk me to death 
 Like murder's on your mind mami, off the dress 
 Jigga ran game till I lost my breath 
 Sauce money 
 Last thing I need to know is what it costs for sex 
 What you need to know is if I lost respect 
 Don't have to worry if you do sauce correct 
 I'ma bless that, bring my whole crew through, don't even sweat that 
 Jay-z: uh, dime pieces I'm hittin' 
 Sauce money: four in the morning frosted flakes in your kitchen 
 Jay-z: now you want me to start trickin' I suppose 
 Sauce money: that's when the first face off kicks in- 
 We don't love these hoes!
