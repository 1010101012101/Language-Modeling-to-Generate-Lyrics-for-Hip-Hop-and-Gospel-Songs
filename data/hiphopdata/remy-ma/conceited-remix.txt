{Remy Ma} 
 I let um touch it, bring it, play it, watch it, turn it, leave it, I'm conceited 
 And I look too good for a remix, they don't call me a bitch for no reason 
 See, I need silence when I'm speakin', (shh shh) yeah just like that 
 I told this dude I missed him then turned ma fones off and got missin' 
 Listen, when Remys in the system ain't no tellin' will I fuck him will I kiss him 
 I lick ma lips but I'll never kiss um 
 See I'm nasty, but that's nasty 
 I throws it back when he throws it at me 
 And we always make up 'cause he trys to Mac me 
 And I know these chicks jealous that's why I'm laughin' 
 Pretty Remy, Remy pretty either way it's accurate 
 {Papoose} 
 Oh no, why your girl let Pap in 
 Yankee hat with the Pelly Pelly jacket 
 I'm grippin, and grippin on a Magnum 
 He grillin me and I'm about to clap um 
 Don't believe the rumours they all liars 
 They mad 'cause I'm close 2 rim like car tyres 
 I pay for no bitch, lust is free 
 I'm like $1,000 imma G! 
 And listen, I'll wire ya money jaw, what he think he provin? 
 I'll wire money like Weston Union on the highway 
 With Kia in the all black 2 seater 
 License behind ____

 Bye, cya. 
 See I look too good for this necklace, 
 And I look too good to be wearin this, 
 Y'know I look way too good to be innocent, 
 I'm conceited, it's the remix. 
 See, I look too good to be drivin' that, 
 And I look too good to be buyin that, 
 Y'know I look way too good to be tryin' that. 
 I'm conceited, it's the remix 
 {Lil Wayne} 
 Call me, Young Weezy baby 
 Grown ass ladies wana come rape me 
 And Baby pays me, dollas and cents 
 And I ain't conceited, I'm convinced 
 See, I ain't your boyfriend, I'm your pimp 
 I'll pull out my pistol 
 And shoot at your lips pow pow mama 
 I'm just spoilt mama 
 Don't have a cow mama 
 See I jus spend a hundred thou on a smile mama 
 Imma laugh so hard when it ain't even funny 
 Imma get ma shine on when it ent even sunny 
 I'm money, sittin' in a coupe like a tub dem twentys 
 I Had Twenty ones But They Rub 
 Top off 
 But when I put it on its soft 
 Put that thing in first, navigation get lost 
 Lets talk, she think she on some fly ass shit 
 But I'm the Birdman Jr. I could buy that bitch 
 {Trina} 
 The baddest, like y'all ain't know 
 See Trina out chillin' where y'all can't go 
 That yacht takes me where ever I please 
 In the middle of the ocean and get on them jet ski's 
 My, hair weave is about 5 g's 
 All them natural blondes so jealous of me 
 I, jus giggle when I turn my cheek 
 I'm the queen of Miami, Yes that's my beach. 
 I'm so exotic got diamonds all over my golden body 
 I'm never drivin', I'm always ridin', back seat Phantom, Maybak probably 
 I, miss me with the drama lil mama 
 Already got numbers, now I'm workin on commerce 
 I promise, I'm over heated 
 I'm hot, I'm fire, I'm so conceited. 
 See I look to good to be fuckin' you, 
 And I look too good to be lovin' you, 
 You know I look way too good to be stuck with you. 
 I'm conceited, this the remix 
 See, I look too good to be gettin' wit, 
 And I look too good to be havin' kids, 
 'Cause you know, I look way too good to be in the crib. 
 I'm conceited, this the remix. 
 {Jae Millz} 
 Look, I'm way 2 fly to be sweatin you 
 And I get too much top 2 be blessin you 
 You know I'm gettin' way too much money to be stressing you 
 You's a birden, mami you can fly like birdman 
 See this singer I was layin on, 
 She says she love it when my broke with my shades is on 
 Either the black Gucci's or the tinted D&Gs 
 Probably why I'm always getting hated on (hell yeah) 
 Feelin' myself, why wouldn't I, how couldn't I, 
 Shit on birds, ________, why shouldn't i 
 I'm So so Harlem,

 How you gonna front like ya doobie rap straight 
 When hair fucked up and ya louis bag fake 
 I gotta stunt wen I float in the coupe 
 To the death
