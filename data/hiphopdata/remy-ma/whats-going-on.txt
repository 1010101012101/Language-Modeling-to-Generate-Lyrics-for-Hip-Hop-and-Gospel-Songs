(Feat. Keyshia Cole) 
 (Keyshia:) Mmmmmm Mmmmmm Heeeeeey 
 (Remy:) 
 Why didn't I see the signs I was to busy getting high 
 Runnin' up the studio smoking dro writing rhymes 
 To blind to notice my abdomen was growin' 
 Having sex wit out protection now my belly is showin 
 Nobody know that me and my boo trying to decide 
 What to do he buggin like that's a little me inside of you 
 It ain't true and I'm scared and I can tell he is worried a bit 
 So we proceed to get the weed and straight ignoring the shit 
 My jeans don't want to fit every morning hurling and shit 
 I had to tell my family I knew they all was goin' to flip 
 And his was happy thinking he was about to be a daddy 
 But I knew it wasn't true even though we both wanted it so badly 
 Tell me what's goin' I know what I'm doing is wrong 
 Can you hear me Lord when I'm callin for give me my baby 
 How am I supposed feel the situation is real 
 Neva wanted to let cha baby go we'll meet again I know baby 
 We love each other madly so much to gain so much to lose 
 I'm in pain your mind frame change when you the one that gotta 
 Choose talk a walk step in my shoes think in negative thoughts 
 Politics and shit quit when the doctor says positive it's a life living 
 In my body but it don't gotta to live it's up to me but if I keep what 
 The fuck I got to give I mean I'm still young and I don't really have 
 Shit and if this nigga up and leave then my child a be a bastard 
 This is drastic nobody really understands me and my mom don't 
 Give a fuck and neither does the rest of the family they like 
 Remy you can't afford it you expect us to support it 
 I feel my seeds apart of me and I don't want to abort it so: 
 Tell me what's goin' I know what I'm doing is wrong 
 Can you hear me Lord when I'm calling for give me my baby 
 How am I supposed feel the situation is real 
 Neva wanted to let cha baby go we'll meet again I know baby 
 I'm not steady but I can get ready for responsibilities shit where 
 Would I be if my moms got rid of me I'm so stressed and I'm 
 Under a lot of pressure but all I need is the remedy to make Remy 
 Feel better I knew I couldn't win so I chose to forfeit it's a shame 
 I'm over four months and I'm in the doctors office I swear to all that 
 I love that I wanted to leave and wait five more months and birth the child 
 That I conceived but I sat there because I felt I had to and I cry everyday 
 Because I realize boy or girl that I wanted to have you don't be made at me 
 How it is is how it had to be and any pain I put you through is all coming 
 Back to me 
 (Chorus: Repeat until fade) 
 Tell me what's goin' I know what I'm doing is wrong 
 Can you hear me Lord when I'm callin for give me my baby 
 How am I supposed feel the situation is real 
 Neva wanted to let cha baby go we'll meet again I know baby
