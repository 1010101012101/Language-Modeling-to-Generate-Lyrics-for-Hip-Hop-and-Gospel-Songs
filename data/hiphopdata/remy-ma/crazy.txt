Crazy (Crazy) 
 Some times I'm crazy baby 
 Crazy (Crazy) 
 Ooh ooh 
 It's crazy 
 I be thinkin' people tryna play me 
 Latly I know I be flippin on a daily basis 
 I hate waitin, I'm impatient 
 Bitch don't ask me why I gotta nice grill 
 This is just how my face is 
 I piss, in public places 
 Slightly racist, right now I'm robbing a thief and I'm fuckin' a rapist 
 I married an imagrant to get him his papers 
 Niggaz don't wanna give me the mic 'cause they afraid I'mma say shit 
 And that's right I'mma say shit 
 Right in they faces 
 This is Remy straight on the rocks wit nothin' but chase it 
 I'mma new breed of female 
 Far from the basic 
 And if you still can't see that then you need to get lasik 
 I'mma make a statement: I'm the replacement 
 I'm so close to the top I can almost taste it 
 So ill, so real so far from fakers 
 Rem to Fred wit the strip pole in the basement 
 Now that's crazy 
 Crazy (Crazy) 
 Some times I'm crazy baby 
 Crazy (Crazy) 
 Ooh ooh - (2x) 
 Some say I'm 7:30 in the M-730 
 Been smokin' since I was 13 
 Been on my own since I was half of 30 
 I thought I ain't have to worry 
 Because I was always pretty 
 I find a dumb nigga gettin' dough and do his pockets dirty 
 But see that wasn't workin 
 And I wasn't tryna work in 
 I got my own work in 
 I started puttin' work in 
 Some say it ain't worth it 
 I say I ain't perfect 
 Matter of fact I'm sayin', doin' the fuck I feel 
 I make people nervous 
 Who say I ain't 'bout it 
 I'm still from the projects 
 What you talkin' bout bitch 
 I sets it on bounces 
 I don't think you understand son 
 You know how many clubs I been from 
 And I can careless 
 I'm so careless 
 I'm from the generation where we did shit because you dared us 
 I said I wish every breath I take didn't taste like drunk 
 And every sentence I say came out in a flow 
 I swear I wouldn't have to write or spend dough on smokes 
 Now that's crazy 
 Crazy (Crazy) 
 Some times I'm crazy baby 
 Crazy (Crazy) 
 Ooh ooh 
 Yo I'm crazy nigga 
 So don't play wit me nigga 
 Put ya head down when you talk 
 Watch what you say to me nigga 
 See I got goupin if I won 
 I can pay for you nigga 
 I'm the type let you pipe but I won't stay with you nigga 
 Leave you in telly on ya belly don't wanna lay with you nigga 
 Yeah I say it's ya pussy but I always say that to niggas 
 See I'm really the business 
 This is goin' into history 
 I just got my own company 
 I love it call me misery 
 I said I walk around the metal dectors 
 Who does that 
 Before I told them lean back 
 I told bitches to run that 
 And if they ain't show me where the ones and the funds at 
 More or less I was gunna show them how the guns clap 
 I pull a weed nigga and treat his stash like a fun pack 
 See you tryna do it to me I does that 
 Hold Up 
 Matta fact 
 I think the craziest shit I ever said is I wish I could bring Pun back (echo) back back 
 Crazy (Crazy)
