(Remy ma:) 
 He put the gun in my hand 
 I took my hand and put the gun in my pants 
 I took my pants and pulled them up on my ass 
 I got the cash out my pocket dropped it 
 And got my ass outta dodge 
 Put into the car started it stepped on the gas 
 Looked at the dash see 95 really seem fast when you so fucking mad and so fucking high 
 And you can't stop crying 
 Oh shit I just ran a stop sign fuck it its nothing 
 This nigga got me stressing 
 I can't believe he got me bugging 
 Now I'm driving reckless I can't even see and my high beams ain't even helping 
 But nobody be really using the streets before 7 
 I got the pedal to the metal like I lost my mind 
 And I ain't even see the school crossing sign 
 Car in the faster gear wind blowing in my hair 
 Seat belt, light blinking, but I don't care 
 Somebody crossing the street cam outta no where 
 Ran right into them body flew in the air 
 Oh my GOD my face already covered with tears 
 Saying my prayers I ain't even say I swear 
 I thoguht off of reflex saw blood every where 
 Mostly around the head of the litlle girl holding a teddy bear 
 I'm sorry all I can hear is I want my mommy 
 Then I ain't hear nothing from the little girls body 
 I'm scared but I can't stop what I'm gon do 
 First thing the cops gon say was that it was drug influence 
 They ain't gon understand what this nigga was doin' 
 How he made me drive fast when I should've be cruising 
 And they probably ain't gon believe that it wasn't they weed and shorty 
 Just popped up in the middle of the street 
 And they really gon be hating wit this gun on my waist 
 And I checked shorty pulse and I don't think she gon make it 
 Dial 911 or damn should I run 
 I'm just weighing out my options before some body come 
 If I stay I go to jail if I run I'll be wrong 
 This is taking to long 
 Fuck it I'm gone 
 Hit and run 
 Damn I shoulda hit my brakes 
 Hit and run 
 Sometimes we all make mistakes 
 Hit and run 
 I guess I'm not that heartless 
 Hit and run 
 'Cause now I got a guilty conscience
