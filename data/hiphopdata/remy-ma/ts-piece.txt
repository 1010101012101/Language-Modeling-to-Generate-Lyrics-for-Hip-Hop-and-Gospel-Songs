(Feat. Fat Joe and Tony Sunshine) 
 (Fat Joe) 
 Yeah uh... 
 You know what this is... 
 The fat gangsta! 
 (Tony Sunshine) 
 Maybe it's the TS chain (I got 'em right) 
 Maybe it's that Escalade (Come get 'em right) 
 Maybe it's the way I do (Keep mamies like) 
 Joe I wanna fuck wit u (Keep sayin' that) 
 I don't know what it is 
 All I know it that this chick 
 Is gon leave wit me 
 Gon creep wit me 
 Gon freak wit me 
 Gon leave wit me 
 (Fat Joe) 
 I know it seems every song, is about like the same old thing 
 But when you rich, ain't nothin' to do but fuckin' hang 
 Eat good, spend money, count chunks of change 
 Keep mah ladies lookin' good, when they touch the Range. 
 Never fuck wit a bitch, if she can't be trained 
 Never leave wit a chick, if she don't give brain. 
 We could leave on trip, I got a private plane 
 I don't fly, but we could park it up and blaze. 
 Joe's the God 
 And I know you need somethin' to praise 
 Just have a lil faith, and you could be saved. 
 Uh, it's not mah fualt if they love the kid 
 It might be the chain or the whip 
 I don't know what it is. 
 (Remy Ma) 
 Umm, I don't mean no harm 
 But their ain't a chick sicka then Remy Ma 
 And all the hot boys wanna fuck wit Rem 
 And I don't turn 'em away 
 I'm like, I'm the bomb now. 
 Where's your gurl, don't matter to me 
 I'm way out of her league 
 She can't keep up to mah speed. 
 She's weak, she don't need to smoke weed 
 And wherever she's at 
 Is where she should be. 
 Now, where's your wife, I don't care 
 I'll be at the crib, when she ain't there. 
 Baby do mah nails, and lace mah hair 
 Take me out on trips and pay the fare. 
 Maybe. 
 (Fat Joe) 
 Damn, look at all the rocks he got 
 Ferrari drop 360, hard to top 
 The party's hot, all white linen affair 
 I'm doin' the suit thang, white Nike Airs. 
 I'm in the middle of the crowd, like the Don is here. 
 Shorty whistlin in mah ear 
 Told me what she wanna hear, she said 
 "We thuggin' 
 Smokin' on sumthin 
 Down to leave wit y'all, As long as y'all fuckin'." 
 Woo, thas how you do that there 
 See me wit mah boys, bring ya crew bak here 
 We ridin', she drivin' 
 On our way to the crib, long fish arrivin. 
 (Tony Sunshine) 
 Maybe it's the TS chain (I got 'em right) 
 Maybe it's that Escalade (Come get 'em right) 
 Maybe it's the way I do (Keep mamies like) 
 Joe I wanna fuck wit u (Keep sayin' that) 
 I don't know what it is 
 All I know it that this chick 
 Gon leave wit me 
 Gon creep wit me 
 Gon freak wit me 
 Gon leave wit me 
 Gon leave wit me 
 Gon creep wit me 
 Gon freak wit me 
 Gon leave wit me
