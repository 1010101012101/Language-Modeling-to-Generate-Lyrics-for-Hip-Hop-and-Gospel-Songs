You look like a bitch gotcha face all bent up 
 I like a pimp got my gators and my pimp 
 You take orders and run errands 
 I take vacations with killers and four time felons 
 You outside on line like where the weed 
 I'm inside getting high V.I.P stats 
 You where the rats and the D's at 
 I'm where the B's and the C's and the real O.G's at 
 Ayo the girl spits harder than most dudes 
 I give it to you on any given Sunday like soul food 
 I ain't even gotta double my vocals 
 I do a main scence that lives and the rest is produce 
 I'm in the booth wit no shoes and my chain be bangin' the mic so I don't got on no jewels 
 I'm so hot and I done told you 
 You ain't no kiddin to me so basically I don't know you 
 You don't know me homie I clap you with yo heat 
 If this was a lake 
 I'd be a mother fucking Ojay 
 Set off the sirens form thy alliance 
 It's a four alarm blaze and I'm on fire 
 I was talking to Kanye and I heard the wire 
 That I'm the truth and you're a liar 
 I'm the queen of rap and there is none higher and all you slut bag hoers should call me sire 
 I'm like fuck that this is it 
 All these other chicks is wack and I'm the shit 
 See I'm from New York so I repped the Knicks 
 I'mma I'mma Husslin I could get them bricks 
 They say my flow is crazy and I could spit and I rap as if I had a dick 
 Bitches is bad but I'm that bitch 
 Listen I'm so above the average 
 Now my walk is mean but my whip is sick 
 I can't stand a clown but I love a trick 
 I see a group of dudes and I take my pick 
 Like you you and you with the Timbs hi nice to meet you my name is Rem 
 I don't drive a caddy but I'm stuntin like a pimp struct 
 With a diddy bop looking something like a lick 
 I cleaned up my money now I'm filthy fucking rich (shit) 
 See I'm from where niggas stash packs in the backs of their ball sack and pump crack, yak, D, weed and that 
 Put more baking soda in there coke to get more back 
 Roc Timberlands uptowns White Tees and sports hats 
 We kill all rats tell lies cheat and steal 
 Tints pitch black even gotta 'em on the windsheild 
 Liscense suspended Vehicles rented 
 Warrants open cases several offenses 
 No phone no cable notices of eviction 
 Parents is addicted kids don't listen 
 No rules no school no food in the kitchen and the staircase and elevator smell like piss 
 You can only talk tough if you do tough things 
 If you ain't from around here you better tuck them blings 
 Only difference between me and you is that I got out the hood but the hood is still in me
