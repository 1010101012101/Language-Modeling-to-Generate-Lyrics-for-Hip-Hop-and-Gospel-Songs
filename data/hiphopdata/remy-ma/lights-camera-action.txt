(Remy Talkin') 
 Here I am standin in my b-boy stance 
 I got my name air brushed down the leg of my pants 
 I got my 54 letters and my kangol on 
 Bamboo earrings and my bangles on 
 Word up, the girl look good 
 Imma 80's baby, paid an full 
 Look at my rope chain 
 Now check my belt buckle 
 Put my gazelles on my eyes, now I'm lookin' for trouble 
 I need a Solider that's stackin an packin, we can't even talk if you can't fit a magnum 
 I'm fresh to deaf when it comes to fashion, see i, 
 Switched up to my 8 ball jacket and my spandex got me stoppin' traffic, baby, not for nuttin imma walkin' accident 
 They catch whiplash, every time I'm passin em 
 Its time for some, time for some, time for some... 
 Niggaz bring ya gunz and ya 9'z along 
 Why? 
 Remy Mas on the microphone... 
 The levels, the levels, the levels is good, the levels is good, the levels is good 
 Bitchez bring ya gunz and ya 9's along 
 Why? 
 Remy Ma's on the Microphone 
 The levels, the levels, the levels is good, the levels is good, the levels is good 
 Yeah, Remy wanna rock, how hard is that, I'm from tha BX bronx, where it started at 
 We had jams in the park, muthafuck a disco, everybody smokin' joints, sippin cisco 
 Two turn tables and tha microphone full throtle, ill pull up in that Alf or a Mayo Malano, system bangin', drivin' reckless, like I dotn give a fuck about 
 My B-B-S's YO check this 
 I hopped out wit my ass cheeks showin through my salt 'n' peppers 
 Only got one chance to make a first impression, Spit like Big Pun and KRS one Mixxed! 
 My Flows sick but its more then Rappin', First chick try to front 
 First chick I'm smackin, on some Red man shit, Bitch I ain't laughin' 
 Its time for some, time for some, time for some 
 Big Rem from the Boondocks, I'm like all I really need is my Boom-Box, 
 Listen, we can get it poppin', I'm doin' the wop and he 1,2 steppin like there ain't no stoppin' 
 All my fellas say OH, my ladies say Awe, yeah MC's gone move the crowd, I'm fuckin' dope, fresh 2 def, cold, chillin' and I'm sippin on juice and gin 
 Its Friday night and I jus got paid, I ain't dressed up or nuttin I'm trynna get laid, I'm trynna get shorty ova there wit tha fade, by the end of the night 
 To say my name, but these LIGHTS is all in my face, and I'm really feelin' like I'm a star on stage, Cameras flashin, everybody pose, cause its about time for 
 Some... 
 (Chorus 1x... then fade)
