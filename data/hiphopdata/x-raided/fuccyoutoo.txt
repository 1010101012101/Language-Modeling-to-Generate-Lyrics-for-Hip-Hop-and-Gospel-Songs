(X-Raided) 
 X-Raided, say it three times 
 In the dark and the gun he carries up 
 Spray it three times to the heart like Bloody Mary 
 But not the alcoholic beverage nigga 
 I'm the type to get after the tightest dog for leverage nigga 
 I'm competitive nigga 
 I slay more people than you 
 And I'm a predator nigga 
 Way more evil than you 
 Spray a Desert Eagle at you 
 Let your flesh roast in fire 
 And that's [?] I'm Jesus West Coast Mesiah, what's y'all 
 And recognize this 
 It's my life that'll make the nicest rapper 
 You know, bow down and kiss my Nikes 
 I wish y'all, would be real 
 Instead of prime time actin' 
 Speakin' behind my back like chiropractors 
 I got the nitro factor 
 Send my ho at you 
 She got the gat, and that's for real 
 I'm a hydro bastard, like caine 
 Foo you ain't able to play my game 
 That's why you get live ones to the gun 
 Every time you day my name 
 I wish y'all had the balls to just tell me the truth 
 You thinkin' fucc X-Raided 
 But I'm screamin' fuccyoutoo 
 Wish y'all quit playin' the role like it's all cool 
 You thinkin' fucc X-Raided 
 But I'm screamin' fucc y'all too 
 I wish y'all had the balls to just tell me the truth 
 You thinkin' fucc Madman 
 But we screamin' fucc y'all too 
 I wish y'all quit playin' the role like it's all cool 
 You thinkin' fucc Madman 
 But I'm screamin' fucc y'all too 
 (X-Raided) 
 I wish y'all niggas'll understand 
 We'll whack your kinfolks 
 If we go broke we got plans 'cause we Jack-ramento 
 Rep your city, nigga Sac-A-Indo 
 Where niggas pity square ballaz 
 'Cause the killaz is quick to mack your mental 
 [?] Fits at the town 
 Bitch we'll jack your rental 
 Wish y'all niggas would recognize this, Sacramento 
 Step aside nigga don't you feel the Earth vibratin' 
 Rise up out the grave 
 All my niggas heard Brian Haydan 
 Resurrected, I'm the real nigga reanimated 
 And life is hectic 
 Strong enough to make a man be a hater 
 I suspected y'all niggas was schemin' 
 To step to me mean 
 'Cause every time I see you I hear the Jeopardy theme 
 Then I got more answers for yo ass 
 Than Iverson and Alex Trebeck combined 
 Splatter you spine when I blast 
 Shatter your neck wit a nine 
 Add up the sets 
 24 plus 6-8 plus deuce-9 
 Equals 121 niggas willin' to grab you until you die
