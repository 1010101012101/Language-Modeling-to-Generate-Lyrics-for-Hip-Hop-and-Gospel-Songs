He said, "They're really not real, they're just a front for the girls" 
 Then a whole bunch of fists just, caved he's world 
 He was in pain, so ashamed, he wish he had not came 
 Had to kindly pick up my face and then ride home on the train, then 
 H went to an open store that's where they brought/bought him a quart 
 Then I went to the park, and I sat and I thought 
 Got real drunker than a skunk and happy as can be 
 We went, to the Latin Quarters and we got in free 
 Scoopin all the girls like nuttin with my trunk jewelry 
 'Cause I'ma fly brown brother and you can't school me 
 Peter gunz was performin hey they ain't no joke
