Oh boy, Rick look all sad again. 
 What's the matter Rick? 
 It's a long story, check it out 
 Call me the freaker, I bump it in your speaker 
 Week of my birthday met this girl named Tameka 
 Astonishing creature made the rest look tired 
 Desired, though was it beauty I admired? 
 Out by the 41, broke, no joke 
 Can I have a toke, fine hooker so I smiled and smoked 
 Gave the girl my number, though I still felt rejected 
 Hectic, called me more than I expected 
 Months passed by, even lived together and all 
 Dream come true, until suddenly a call 
 Oh brother, why do I discover 
 My honey, Tameka, yeah callin' me another 
 Broke hearted again, it offend and I pretend 
 Mistakes of a woman in love with other men 
 How low can go/Hold it now 
 Well, tried to block it out my mind, here it was again 
 Other men, confronted later and she said he was a friend 
 Didn't believe her, she packed 
 Brave her, strange behavior, so silly me forgave her 
 Late again Thursday, alone Rick sat 
 Left flat, look in the mirror and I wonder where she at 
 Gave the girl my heart and soul, it's after ten 
 And again couldn't manage if she slept with other men 
 Out with my jewelry so you know she looked truck 
 Struck three o'clock, here she come, fishy like a fuck 
 "Come here let me smell you", I wanted to say "to hell you" 
 "Hi honey, sorry I'm late, but let me tell you" 
 It's a fast chat, need the phone, so I'm roped in 
 "Could you go to the store and get some soda 'cause they open?" 
 Again it offend and I pretend 
 Mistakes of a woman in love with other men 
 How low can go/Hold it now 
 Strike one, strike two, no exaggeration 
 Tried to play it off like it was my imagination 
 Beer mixed with alcohol, help me to forgive 
 Deal with weak minded and I have no will to live 
 I deserve honesty, get treated like a pet 
 Now she's bein' nice but no I still can't forget 
 Put the cards on the table, don't get loud, cut the bull out 
 If you slept with another man, I'm strong enough to pull out 
 She confessed and then she left, smooth 
 Wanted to kill myself 'cause to live ain't the move 
 Broke-hearted again, it offend and I pretend 
 Mistakes of a woman in love with other men 
 Once again it offend, and I pretend 
 Mistakes of a woman in love with other men 
 Once again it offend, and I pretend 
 Mistakes of a woman in love with other men 
 Once again it offend, and I pretend 
 Mistakes... in love with other men
