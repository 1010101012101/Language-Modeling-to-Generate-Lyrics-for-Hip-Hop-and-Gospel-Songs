Warm it up V. 
 Well I'ma tell you a story and I come out bluntly 
 Want a ugly child? Hey nobody would want me 
 I used to walk around and get upset and upsetter 
 Till I figured out ways to make myself look better 
 As I got older, my awareness expanded 
 I met this beautiful girl and my wish was commanded 
 Didn't hang with fellas, 'cause they started gettin' shady 
 I'd always be with my girl and y'all could call her my lady 
 I loved her a lot, word up, not going to front see 
 The problem did arise is why on earth did she want me? 
 Couldn't figure it out and to make things worse 
 I was cursed, with the torment of not being the first 
 And the first was this fly guy, made me very jealous 
 Always think she'd cheat on me and talk to other fellas 
 Two wrongs don't make a right, but any we would fight 
 I would kindly pick up the phone and call a girl out of spite 
 I shouldn't have done it, man 
 I'm feelin' sad and blue 
 I wanted to make this right, so direct I was admirin' 
 I tried to stop my love, but no love was not retirin' 
 To catch her in a lie was near impossible and tricky 
 Didn't want her in certain clothes, gettin' really picky 
 We got into it again, this time she got too bright 
 So me preventin' a fight, I just stayed out for the night 
 I had to ease up off the pressure, all this heartache pain so 
 I went up to the Parrot, with Omega, Vance, and Dane 
 This girl came over, she was trucked down excessive 
 Started talkin' to me (hi), and she was poppin' quite aggressive 
 A pretty young thing, she didn't strike me as no ho 
 So weak minded Rick the Ruler went on with the flow 
 My joint was gettin' hard, word, without me even knowin' 
 We stepped back to my van and I could feel it's for her growin' 
 The girl took off her coat her body was no joke 
 Well, a rub or two, unzip it, and I went for broke 
 I shouldn't have done it 
 Now I've sinned and there's no one to blame 
 That night when I went home, I felt real guilty and ashamed 
 Snuck right into bed, I felt just like a shady fella 
 What made me so self-centered, how am I ever gonna tell her? 
 I shouldn't have cheated, just because we'd always doubt 
 Endurance, be a man, that's what I had to learn about 
 Now me, I guess I'm like there's one [or] two secrets that I hid 
 I figure, I'd patch things up and then I'll tell her what I did 
 Then after that, she started actin' heaven sent 
 I found the house spotless and said she help out with the rent 
 So, I bought the ring, it was a good 20 Karat 
 Then word got back about me chillin' at the Parrot 
 So when I got home, I thought she'd just be out to roast 
 Instead I found this letter, and I found her overdosed 
 It said "I do for you but I guess you didn't care" 
 All this went and happened 'cause of me and my affair 
 I shouldn't have done it man
