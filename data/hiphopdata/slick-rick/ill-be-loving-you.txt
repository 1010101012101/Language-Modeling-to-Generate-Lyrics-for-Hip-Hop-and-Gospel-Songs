(Sung by slick rick) 
 Seems like yesterday 
 We used to rock the post 
 Makin' love in the sheets 
 Like a ghost 
 Kissin' and touchin 
 And holdin' ya close 
 Kimberly Caire 
 You've got to know that 
 Love ain't always 
 What it seems to be 
 Words can't express 
 What you mean to me 
 Even though you're gone 
 We're still a team 
 Through ya family 
 I'll forfill your dreams 
 In the future 
 Can't wait to see 
 If you open up 
 Your heart to me 
 Reminis some time 
 When they took ya Kim 
 'Try to black it out 
 But it plays again 
 When these tears 
 Are hard to concil 
 Can't imagine 
 All the pain I feel 
 Give anything 
 To hear half ya breathe 
 'Cause I know that I'll still love you 
 Till my death 
 Every breath you take 
 Every move you make 
 Every single day 
 Every bond you break 
 I'll be loving you 
 It's kinda hard 
 When your not around 
 To know your at yor window 
 Looking down 
 Believe me, girl 
 I cry for you 
 Every night 
 I cry for you 
 When these tears 
 Are hard to concil 
 Can't imagine 
 All the pain I feel 
 Give anything 
 To hear half ya breathe 
 'Cause I know that I'll still love you 
 Till my death
