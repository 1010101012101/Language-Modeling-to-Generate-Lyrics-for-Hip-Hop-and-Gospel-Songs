 (Snoop dogg) 
 I falls off into a party in the n.y.c. 
 Niggaz lookin' at me strange but they lovin' my chain 
 Bang bang, same thang, game came when I left em 
 I do it by my lonely now I'm the big homie 
 (Slick rick) 
 But I'm his royal slickness, ghetto weakness, come rick is 
 The one who expose cornball rappers with the quickness 
 Uh, who bum from and who balls you hung from 
 Wouldn't give a fuck what part of the country you come from 
 (Snoop dogg) 
 I'm snoop dogg, I'm smooth and imperial 
 I wake up every morning to my lucky charms cereal 
 Times get drastic, yeah I'm a classic 
 Dogg pound gangsta chokin off that boombastic 
 (Slick rick) 
 Now put my verse on the first one-beat the herds come 
 So be careful cause my rap will make you eat your words son 
 (Word to God) scratch i? who the hardest to match (I) 
 Bright rewrite your still garbage to patch 
 (Snoop dogg) 
 Haven't you heard? I'm loose, shook the feds like the juice 
 Snoop dogg is a hundred-and-twenty-first proof 
 Fool usea deuce-deuce of some genuine, draft 
 I'm genuine, like vinny's whinin all about cash 
 Cash, cash, so indeed I got the weed 
 And keep the lighter for the hash, has it, 
 Ever been a time when you didn't have a dime 
 And the only way to get it was to go and do a crime? 
 Chorus: slick rick (repeat 2x) 
 Many underclothes hangin' on the hoes 
 Since (snoop, slick rick) crushed anyone opposed 
 Lot of ladies - pop cristal, toast to all those 
 Like (kid capri) helpin to unify both coasts 
 (Slick rick) 
 I'm shredding your temple, none, 'head of the emperor 
 Washed up, gang member? better remember 
 I wipe my feet upon a rapper like a doormat 
 I hit 'em -- where they sit around actin' hardcore at 
 Thank God for the guardians - in light of this 
 Rappers always beg for me to show them who the mighty is 
 Gats gonna limp, snaps on a kid 
 That always wanna start rappin' (boy they're not gonna win) 
 And wanna dash at lethal or evil 
 Could a king bring style and class to black people? 
 Stick a whole log in and he buggin 
 'Cause I - represent self, with my man snoop dogg and them 
 I drop a pile of semen on em 
 Even in a yugo I could take they woman from em 
 I make the hardest chew the kewl of this 
 Kid capri, know the part of peasant, who the ruler is? 
 (Snoop dogg) 
 I'm twenty-six... still in the mix 
 My hair gettin' longer, my game gettin' stronger 
 A nigga been on one, I thank god 
 Cause life in the city of stars is gettin' hard 
 And it's odd, for a g to get a job 
 So I'd rather steal and rob, and mob with my squad 
 My homie used to bang, now we follow farrakhan 
 Used to read the source 
 Now all he read is the holy qu'ran 
 Time brings change and change brings time 
 Listen to me hit you with this gangbang rhyme 
 Nigga, whattup, who up, you up! 
 Doggy dogg is on the mic 
 I'm here to fuck it izzzup 
 I give it to y'all, like you really got to have it 
 Dogg pound gangstaz, boy this shit is gettin' tragic 
 But I'ma make me a grip and dip quick 
 And fuck with my nigga kid capri on this g shit 
 Dial tail and bail with my nigga slick rick-y 
 And all you niggaz talkin' bullshit can just miss me 
 Can't twist me, you fuckin' paper haters 
 I'm dippin in my nine-eight gold navigator 
 I'm dippin like a lo-lo 
 Bouncin', smokin' ounces, fo' sho' doe
