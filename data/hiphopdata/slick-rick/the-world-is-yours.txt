 This track here may cause concern 
 For all the leaders- Why don't you listen and learn 
 To love this happiness, once we're strong 
 But to (society) even that's (turned wrong) Why! 
 Are we dumb-dummie and disrespect mommie and why! 
 She put you on earth and loved you since birth and you 
 "Hey young world" 
 The world is yours 
 "Hey young world" 
 The world is yours 
 "Young world, young world" 
 The world is yours 
 "Young world, young world" 
 Young world, young wo-ah-ah-rld 
 The world is a brainwashed kid (kid...) run wild 
 Young little girls, already have a child 
 Bad company and now you've been framed (been framed) 
 Parents are hurtin', so hurted and ashamedp, why! 
 Hey little kids don't follow these adults, why! 
 Don't be a fool, like those who ditch school, it's yours 
 Hear that, hear that, accomplish things 
 You'll see your under, and the trouble life brings 
 To my teens, and all my youth 
 Get on the limited and hold rocks too 
 Listen, be strong and scream Whoopie-woo! 
 Go for yours 'cause dreams come true 
 You'll make your mommy so proud of you to and 
 This is the message at the ruler Rick's school 
 Elders seen our wise ones grown 
 Interest in what the kid learned 'bout 
 Seen how the old spring turned out 
 "Whaa-aa-aa-ah" Mm-mm-mm 
 Knowin' you can know safeguard self 
 Put upon an exciting path 
 You'll see a man's pride they'll have 
 Don't discipline, lose soundly 
 Kids that we have lose boundaries 
 Grow into what's called curserates 
 Like in-de-pen-dence, words case 
 Imprisonment death, therefore 
 Not what we brought kids here for 
 Morales and values of sort 
 Should be the first thing in store 
 Believe it or not, God still shines on you 
 He guides you and, he watched you as you grew 
 Stay out of trouble, when it comes in sight 
 'Cause a man never loses a fight in God's sight!
