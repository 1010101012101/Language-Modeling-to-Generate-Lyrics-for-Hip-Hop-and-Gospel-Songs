Do ya like it, like it, like it, like it girl???? 
 Great I'm in trouble I suppose because I does hit girlfriend 
 Ya love me in my drop top Rolls 
 Traffic came to a halt 
 I'm like "I beg your pardon madam it was truly my fault" 
 And instead of me yelling and add to no above 
 Hon all in my drop dead gorgeous love 
 Pretty? Body definitely ?curnin, and thirdly 
 The way she dyed her hair bronze fitted her superbly 
 Baby, let me say what's on my mind 
 Take a little time to express myself, honey, I think you're fly 
 Now I don't have no problem saying what I like 
 I'd like to spend some time with you starting with tonight a-na-la 
 I like the way you walk 
 The sexy way you talk 
 Ooh I can't help myself 
 Baby, I like 
 I like to kiss your lips 
 And when you move your hips 
 Ooh I can't help myself 
 Baby, I like 
 Here's the situation, I lay it on the line 
 Meaningless relationships they're wasting all my time 
 You are the special someone that I want to get to know 
 Baby can't you see it in my eyes I want to take you home 
 Tonight let's take our time 
 Do it nice, do it slow 
 Baby, we got nowhere to go 
 Oh I hope you don't mind 
 Oh, I'm comin' on real strong 
 I give good lovin' all night long 
 Oh, I like it 
 Get hot and tell me, get hot, Oh 
 Get hot and tell me, get hot, mmm mmm yeah 
 Get hot and tell me, get hot, ooh 
 Get hot and tell me, get hot, baby yeah! 
 Get hot and tell me, get hot, mmm mmm
