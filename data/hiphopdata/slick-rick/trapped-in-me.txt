(Slick Rick) 
 Yeah kid... 
 Well first of all, sit your, 'cause I'm Victor 
 The Ruler decorate a record just like a picture 
 Slicker licker isn't this vigorous 
 Motherfucker too Don Suave for any nigga it's 
 I sold that offender 
 Short killer note is that I wrote a tremendous 
 Old neighborhood chow, now Rick vow 
 Even rich niggaz must bow now 
 Extrordinarily handsome, grandson 
 Pack your bags, suitcase out the mansion 
 Any time that you wish that - I flow that 
 A whole bunch of big shots bums, now you know that 
 Opinions, wifepiece - hers fat 
 You wish a rapper could be better than perfect 
 Candidate, who talk shit anyway 
 And this is what most bitch walk this planet say
