I try to block it out my mind 
 As you see [at] Ruler show's is inquirin' noses 
 Goin' into a story about a kid named Moses 
 Once a prophet was to be born, so for anything else furthered 
 Pharaoh orders every first-born son murdered 
 One got away, a girl with profit bound with her 
 Gently put him in a basket, went floatin' down the river 
 Then ends up by a Pharaoh relative, ol' honey peeped in 
 Couldn't breed herself and was determined to keep him 
 "Don't say a word", she told her slave who was a real witch 
 "Snitch, it'll definitely be the last day you breathe bitch" 
 While kids slaughtered, 'cause they was [in] front of them 
 Soldiers tellin' the king that they murdered every one of them 
 "Thanks" said Pharaoh, guys were a friend to him 
 Sister showin' her baby sayin' "[on] the river God sent him" 
 To her brother who arose and said, "whoa sis!" 
 Curious I suppose this, the upward knows about Moses 
 As time passed he proved he wasn't the type to beg or borrow 
 Grew to conquer lands like ain't no tomorrow 
 Made the son King jealous 'cause he couldn't do what Mo' did 
 "Pops I'm not to happy the way y'all jockin' this Mo' kid" 
 "Son, this rash behavior ruins every feast or bash" 
 "And why complain, now where's the temple I asked you to build, you piece of trash?" 
 "Two of you switch, Mo' you build it and you'll find a supreme hero" 
 "Built it. Anything else, you need Pharaoh?" 
 "King here's startin' to share my crown" 
 One said, "How can he?" 
 But sister not takin' any chance and threw the hooker off the balcony 
 But word still got to King, who then cold cursed Blessed 
 Stripped him of his honors and dumped him in the desert 
 But Mo' returned for the people, with his chest stiff out saw 
 King said, "You want war? Make brick without straw" 
 That's a son not being king, the shorty no good [a]rose his 
 Unhappy I suppose this, the upward knows about Moses 
 The new king said, "As for your threats, brother stuff it" 
 "Boy, what do I do now?" prayed the Prophet 
 Then a vision said "chill" and prophecy filled 
 Scorn build, hails the fire, all their first-born killed 
 It was gettin' scary for the king, this made the sufferin' go by merrier 
 "You win, take these peasants, get the flock out of my area" 
 Poor villain, still in heat, didn't want Mo' to fulfill 'em 
 Wasn't chillin', "then I'll flat send the troops to go and kill him" 
 So Mo' parts the sea, went across and said "run" and 
 Did some ol' abracadabra and water fell upon 'em 
 The soldiers that is, since Moses was suaver 
 Then Mo' in the mountains havin' a convo with the father 
 Came back with the tens, seen pantyhose droppin', partner swappin' 
 Folks wasn't into what poor Mo' was poppin' 
 So the Earth shook and killed those, bible text closes 
 Talked about a time when idle worshippin' foes had met Moses
