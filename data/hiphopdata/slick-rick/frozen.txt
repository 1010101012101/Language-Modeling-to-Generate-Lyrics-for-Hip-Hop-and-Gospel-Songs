"How can I forget you" 4x 
 (Slick rick) 
 Rick the ruler, raekwon, hehe the chef, check one two 
 (Raekwon) 
 Touch more, taste a glass of oil 
 Flash yours rae 
 Money we saw, left 'em dead on the door, dick 
 Rots look chunky on the index 
 Straight up, lee vets and like old adidas sweats 
 We the the illest vets 
 (Slick rick) 
 Apologies, even a non-dog holler "he's honor" 
 Please, appreciate shit I clog wallabee's 
 Brothas wit they fists like oaks wood 
 Provokes doom, and you're also about to go broke soon 
 (Raekwon) 
 Mad current merchants, we nursed it 
 Bad guerillas, feed us like guaranteed they gon' kill us 
 Fleeing, ninety in a night suit, g-ing white dudes 
 Hit the locks first, we made a right troop 
 (Slick rick) 
 I'm lushin Russian women, via satellite I'm watchin 
 I dare a nigga say he wanna battle me, I'll crush ya 
 Even blind girls rush next to hammera and scream out 
 "Oh my gosh, get the camera" 
 Chorus (raekwon) 
 Yo we frozen, lay on the bount now, we a day on 
 Ill niggas yellin' "throw rick and rae on" 
 Hydro, how did I blow, how did I flow 
 Did I glow, let them niggas know 
 (Slick rick) 
 (Yo) 
 Rap wars commence and they kids cause offense 
 I don't have to say a word and your bitch-drawers are drenched 
 Didn't say I was gonna murder the fella 
 But the ruler got some shit the could stop a herd of gorillas 
 (Raekwon) 
 Stressed wit Hollywood hoes, actin' up 
 Backin up, what? this yours, what? 
 Crawlin in the cut, we lee major 
 Gems on wit timbs, brims on drawn to lay you up 
 Layin in the day wit what? 
 (Slick rick) 
 Next pull up ceo wit bank books full up 
 Even though he's overwhelmed, this nigga rolls royce pull up 
 One of the baddest come, noddin to a Spanish song 
 Slung, orange woolridge park and a savannah pump 
 (Raekwon) 
 Severe teaspoons, scary money on the moon 
 Lampin wit a big goon, keep shit tight like a kid's room 
 Big bird in the driveway, bullet out Friday 
 I'm liver that way, I ride only the fly way 
 Olive-green thinkin', ship sinkin 
 Deep-dish thinkin', big fish tank, wrist full of franklins 
 This mock-neck, shark-skin money 
 Eighty-eight, summer reader dun ? dummeries? 
 Rock dungarees 
 (Slick rick) 
 Punctures his lung, son says "i don't want this" 
 Even this so-so beat I make monstrous 
 Lady cops stake to watch pair hoods 
 "Freeze, you're under arrest, you look mad good" 
 Hot and don't fret retard who won't let the new sherifs in town 
 What part you don't get? 
 Rick and rae, and now we storin the passion 
 The fashion, the dress, I went to work on your ass
