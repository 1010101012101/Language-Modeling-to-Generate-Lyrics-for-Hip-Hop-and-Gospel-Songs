Inmate 91849618, pack your stuff, you're free to go... 
 Dum da da dum duh, Dum da da dum duh. 
 Excuse me, I'm trying to earn a mere buck or two 
 A solemn rapper come in, and who the fuck are you? 
 Around this part of town with diamonds and your girl in fur 
 "I'm trying to enter in this rap contest you're havin' sir" 
 You're kinda late "Flat tire" Well that'd do it 'cause 
 Well all right pay me now and you'll be at the hub 
 Excuse me dear, my gosh, you look nice! 
 Put away your money "I'll buy that slice!" 
 She said, "Thanks - I'd rather a slice of you 
 I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you" 
 The compliment showed she had a mind in her 
 It's DJ Run and I'm almost blinded her 
 Ran up the stairs up to the top floor, 
 Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?, 
 Redman the dope fiend puffin smoke, 
 Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap, 
 He said "I need bullets, hurry up, run!"
