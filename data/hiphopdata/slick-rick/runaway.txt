Well, I waited long time sweatin it 
 Gettin' jerked but yeah I'm gettin' it 
 Early mornin, stiff as dawn and 'em, 'cause a brother give the mornin off 
 And then we doin' in, paranoid to new swearin 
 I said meet me in the lobby skip 
 So one could cut down on the cherry tip 
 All right, he flyin scat, to being fair to show a mighty that 
 La Di Da Di wanted Gotti and although depended on the body and 
 Who I know was gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day 
 When I know she's gonna be wit him, so hallelujah, praise God King 
 (Samples) 
 Checked it out, even candle light I figured out 
 Better handle it my nigga, in 
 I think the best thing is to block her out 
 'Cause she doesn't give a fuck about 
 So much change and true it in, you would of cared to wish the u-nion 
 She's not a phony, turn the Sony off, you better overcome the lonely of 
 Although a brother lettin that, thus don't know where I'm headin at 
 To see, even though we fought of it 
 By bother just the very thought of it 
 When I know she's gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day 
 When I know she's gonna be wit him, so hallelujah, praise God King 
 And I know you're gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day 
 When I know you gonna be wit him, can't believe that this is happenin' 
 (Samples) 
 Well, I should say fine and phone wit coin 
 But though you say that I'm the only one 
 What, behind my back thinkin' of, or father not the one I'm thinkin' of 
 On this stress, and when it's gonna end 
 Down wit this burden here I'm wonderin 
 I know I should say fine fed it yeah 
 And think about all the girls ahead of ya 
 Though hard for me to just forget he 
 And try to follow to the letter end 
 Although the terrible things we riff about 
 Or follow wise that I can live it out 
 When I know you're gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day 
 When I know you gonna be wit him, so hallelujah, praise God King 
 When I know you're gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day 
 When I know you gonna be wit him, can't believe this is happenin' 
 I know you're gonna runaway, I know you're gonna be wit him 
 Seems I know you're gonna runaway, I know you're gonna be wit him 
 Can't believe this is happenin'
