Well I shot some deer, then I caught some bear 
 And did a show up in west mother fuck somewhere 
 Due to raps wide ratio, satellites tomato 
 Hillbilly dust flew on stage like tomatoes 
 Apparently more mack than I thought 
 Unfortunelty wife be's back in New York 
 And I'm starvin, being human and open 
 Mad fine hillbilly woman was scopin Rick 
 Thought entered how deline and bented 
 Though I'm not gonna lie I was extremely tempted 
 (To what Rick?) 
 To discharging a sister, next thing in the dressing room 
 ("Pardon me mister") 
 "Yes" I said cautuously 
 ("Crazy but possibly you could sign your name on the back of these dazy duke shorts for me?") 
 Tried to resist girlfriend now starting it 
 "My pen won't write", ("You can press down hard on it") 
 Now my hand browsing the south, run around bout to shove my tongue in her mouth when RING 
 Loosen the grip my held had, my girl she was talking so nice I felt bad 
 Being untrue no telling what it might do to her 
 " I Love you" I'm supposed to say I Love you back too to her. 
 And he thought that getting pussy was doomed 
 ("You gotta wife?") "Anniversary commin up soon too" 
 Got off the phone, copped the scot mute 
 "Don't get me wrong, it's not like you're not cute" (uh huh) 
 I'm all from the street and I be wanting to skeet (I understand good-bye it was real nice meeting ya) 
 What an angel over coming his wrongness, all I am trying to get across in this song is 
 Chorus: (repeat 2x) 
 If goodness is what you're feeling your soul with 
 I wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with 
 Keeps no secrets, like who they creep with 
 Realize early it's a two way street kids 
 Casually seating with some thick cords eating with my album playing at a big board meetin 
 (I love this!) Being the coolest and the roughest 
 A big willy woman pulls the rula in her office 
 I fixed the wedge in her garment unsteady but heartrate 
 Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment 
 Poundon was inedible, she said to me (Rick I think your album is incredible!) 
 The weight upon her pun eye, comin' on the sun I, 
 (Rick I think you're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye) 
 I'm glad you think it's boomin and I catch ya, it means alot to me coming from a woman of your stata 
 I mean who could resist a darn hat, start caressing Rick's private, kiss me on the neck 
 And I can't be held accountable, down her gownable, girlfriend pussy looks plump and poundable 
 She sweats to be everefoah, put one of your legs up on the desk, and let me enter ya 
 Fantastic girl I start to act drastic, when I see my wedding band on the bitch left ass cheek 
 Deep down she felt that I tried to diss. I'm like 
 I can't do this as much as I'd like to miss 
 What an angel over commin his wrong kids, all I am trying to get across in this song is 
 Chrous
