A teenage love, A teenage love 
 Don't, don't hurt me again 
 (Verse One) 
 Hey sport, here's a thought from the old school crew 
 A serious situation we all go through 
 It deals with your feelins, so hear what I say 
 It's like a day when nothing seems to go your way 
 Bust this, two people, they really like each other 
 He says their's no one else 
 And she claims there is no other 
 The feelins the same, and you receive a notion 
 To reveal your inner thoughts and deeply hidden emotions 
 (Verse Two) 
 Precious times, hopin they won't end 
 Tell your mother bout your lover 
 Also your best friend 
 Ya mighty proud while your holdin' their hand 
 Boys, yeah that's my woman, and girls, yeah that's my man 
 This person brings a certain warmth to your heart 
 And everything seems so great at the start 
 For she loves him, and he also loves her 
 And it's hard to turn back to who the person you were 
 But later on, problems start to occur 
 And the bond, which combines, y'all turns into a blur 
 For the feelins were the same, now here's the score 
 You love them to much, and they don't love you anymore 
 Is your attitude a number 
 Or because your not bein true 
 Or maybe they're just plain sick of seein you 
 Word, now it might seem strange 
 You better take hints quick, and make the right change 
 See just when you swore the ball was rollin' 
 They're gone and part of your hearts been stolen 
 Get back on your feet with a hop and a skip 
 But no you'd rather go with this dead relationship 
 Hangin' around and buyin them stuff 
 You see them every darn day yet don't see them enough 
 You follow them around and they claim your hawkin 
 When conversation comes you do all the talkin' 
 Not to mention attention, we all need a bit 
 Beind your back their say yeah he's all up in my 
 They're gtin sick of you and quite annonyed 
 And if you had plans for the future they're now destroyed 
 You saw what was happenin' and you still let it 
 And if you ever let him make love to you girls you can forget it 
 Sweetheart you been caught 
 An it'll spread around town faster then you thought 
 Then breakup time an you receve the word 
 Yo this is from the heart and I know that part hurts 
 Get over it from now on don't take short slick 
 If it's not true love you shouldn't deal with it 
 Just think of your future and what is to come 
 And pay attention to the words in this song 
 They go 
 Do you know where you're goin' to 
 Do you like the things life is showin you 
 Where are you goin' to 
 Do you know 
 Don't hurt me again (8x)
