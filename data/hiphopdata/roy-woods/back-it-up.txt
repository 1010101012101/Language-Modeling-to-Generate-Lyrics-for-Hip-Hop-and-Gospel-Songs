 Girl I'm wavy 
 I don't call you but you wanna see me daily 
 I can't talk to you 'cause I know all your ways 
 Fresh start if you're really down to wait 
 I ain't lettin' go of nothin' that you say 
 Bad things running through my head I don't know 'bout 
 We gon' turn up with PARTYNEXTDOOR 
 So much liquor, I had a gun through on forearm 
 Find out her friends can't leave me alone 
 You want me 'cause I'm in the limelight 
 Act like you don't care about my time 
 Actions don't faze me, you be on your fake shit 
 You can't be my lady
