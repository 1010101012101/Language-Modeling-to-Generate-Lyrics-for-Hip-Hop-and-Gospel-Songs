Oh baby you got me 
 Woah, oh, oh, you hot me 
 Ripping out my hair 
 Having an affair 
 Sweating up in here 
 Swaggered in here 
 Tag me in that pic 
 Cause baby you got me 
 Holding on your hand 
 These girls all want me 
 I ignore them soft tings 
 Mean girl from Austin 
 You need me like a coffee 
 She gets me when she wants me 
 Show me your legs 
 I'll show you the six 
 When you come over 
 Text me when you're sober 
 Oh baby you got me 
 Oh baby you got me 
 Oh baby you got me 
 Oh baby you got me 
 Oh baby you got 
 Oh baby you got me

 Got me lookin' at my phone like, is you there? 
 (Where you at?) 
 She know that I need you here 
 Wonder if you hit my line up 
 Fix up your act girl, respect body 
 I'm actually, got me tired 
 When I'm with you, I get higher 
 Yeah the starter in the line up 
 Momma, I'm feeling your daughter 
 Can we go to dinner we'll pull up to Roscoe's, yeah 
 I hope you show me LA, I'll show you the six 
 When you come over 
 Text me when you're sober 
 Oh baby you got me

 Got me wrapped up 
 In your arms filled with love 
 Girl don't stop
