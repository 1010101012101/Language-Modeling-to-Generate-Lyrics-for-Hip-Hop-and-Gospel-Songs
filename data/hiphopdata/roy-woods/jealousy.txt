This time's not done, but I'm drinking now 
 Unless they find ya', intertwine with me 
 She don't like what's she's forced to see 
 But I could've got started on her 
 She knows what I'm putting on her 
 Girl I stay high, never sober 
 You could have stayed but it's over 
 'Cause you're so jealous of me 
 Oh you're so jealous of me, jealousy over me 
 Why you so jealous, why you so jealous? 
 Why you catchin' feelings, why you catchin' feelings? 
 Why you so jealous, why you so jealous? 
 Why you catchin' feelings, why you catchin' feelings? 
 Why you so jealous, why you so jealous? 
 Why you catchin' feelings, why you catchin' feelings? 
 Jealousy over me 
 My main girl still the realest shit, love me when they say I ain't shit 
 She gon' spend her cash when I'm broke 
 She gon' whip through the 6 and more 
 'Member the days we ain't had no home? 
 Oh mom, I gotta show these niggas what's good 
 Mama, there ain't no bringin' me down 
 Soldier in this bitch, I'm gunnin' them down 
 King with no crown, they still gon' look at me now 
 I been too drunk, I'm way too fucked 
 How you think I'm singing this shit my dog 
 I am not normal, you do not know what I'm on 
 Money callin' up in the party, you know 
 I been turnt up in the club in the max 
 This is my life nigga don't you forget 
 'Cause you're so jealous of me, jealousy over me 
 Why you so jealous, why you so jealous? 
 Why you catchin' feelings, why you catchin' feelings? 
 Why you so jealous, why you so jealous? 
 Why you catchin' feelings, why you catchin' feelings? 
 Why you so jealous, why you so jealous? 
 Why you catchin' feelings, why you catchin' feelings? 
 Jealousy over me, jealousy over me 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah 
 Why you catching feelings, why you gettin' jealous?
