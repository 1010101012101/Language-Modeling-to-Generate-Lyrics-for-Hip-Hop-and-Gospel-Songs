She wanna go far so I told lil mama go long 
 You wonder why I'm here I won't be back for long 
 I gotta make moves No sleep All week in my room 
 Got a another song to write right now This song's about you 
 You say he does it all wrong I wanna get you on one 
 Put you in a soft spot Make you sing "Ah Ah Ah" Like right before you walk in the club imma sit your body up up up 
 You said I need I said imma ting 
 It's OVO right now It's UTU right now 
 They can sleep right now I'm stepping up right now I've been up four nights that's only four now 
 I'm gon' do me Can leave me alone I don't care that's how I feel right now right now
