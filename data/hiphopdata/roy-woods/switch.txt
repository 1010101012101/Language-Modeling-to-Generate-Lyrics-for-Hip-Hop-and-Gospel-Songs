It's not the same anymore 
 Look me in my eyes and say you know me 
 I've been getting this on my own 
 Back then I drop a track and they ignore me 
 I'm on her snapchat story 
 The one I make love to is gorgeous 
 But I've been getting laid 
 I'm getting frustrated 
 Where was they at way back 
 Couches where I slept at 
 Never am I gon' go back 
 For years I had my own back 
 I'm still looking for some closure 
 They can find me on my own car 
 I know I said I'd never stay sober 
 Maybe that's what I can't remember 
 They don't want to talk now 
 Actin' like they've done some' 
 Now they want to switch on me 
 Now they want to switch on me 
 I just copped my home 
 Now that I have grown 
 They don't want to switch on me 
 They don't want to switch on me 
 They don't want to talk now 
 Actin' like they don' something 
 Now they wanna switch on me 
 Now they wanna switch on me 
 I just got my home 
 Now that I have grown 
 They don't want to switch on me 
 They don't want to switch on me 
 Where was they at way back 
 Couches where I slept at 
 Never am I gon' go back 
 For years I had my own back 
 I'm still looking for closure 
 They can find me on my own car 
 I know I said I'd never stay sober 
 Maybe that's what I can't remember 
 They don't want to talk now 
 Actin' like they done some' 
 Now they want to switch on me 
 Now they want to switch on me 
 I just copped my home 
 Now that I have grown 
 They don't want to switch on me 
 They don't want to switch on me 
 They don't want to talk now 
 Actin' like they don' something 
 Now they wanna switch on me 
 Now they wanna switch on me 
 I just got my home 
 Now that I have grown 
 They don't want to switch on me 
 They don't want to switch on me 
 Yeah 
 Oh yeah
