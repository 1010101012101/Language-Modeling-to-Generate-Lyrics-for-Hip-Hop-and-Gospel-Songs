Tell your friends to nize their talk 
 I say less, can't say much 
 Tell me if I'm in the wrong 
 So that I can fix up 
 I don't mind when you're on drugs 
 But sometimes you take too much 
 You can't even clean your mess 
 But you still brush me off 
 Like it's nothing 
 Nothing 
 Nothing 
 Even though you got nothing 
 Nothing 
 Nothing 
 Can't treat everyone like they're nothing 
 Tell me why should we argue 
 Over nothing when I need you like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 When I need you like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Can't see without you can't be without you like 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Can't see without you can't be without you 
 I need you like glasses 
 You get mad at me, although you're wrong 
 I love when you strip to my songs 
 I can watch your body all night long 
 I need you close, don't go too far 
 Back it up and then face me 
 White gyal but dance like Jamaican 
 I already got temptations 
 To get you in my room naked 
 Touch me, lick me 
 I need you (?) to tease me 
 Trust me I know it's easy 
 Wanna cuff me then leave me like it's nothing 
 Nothing, nothing 
 When we both know I'm more than nothing 
 Can't treat everyone like they're nothing 
 Tell me why should we argue 
 Over nothing when I need you like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 When I need you like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Can't see without you can't be without you like 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Like glasses 
 Can't see without you can't be without you 
 I need you like glasses
