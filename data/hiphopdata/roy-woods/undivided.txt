Whoa, whoa, whoa 
 I don't party on Friday night 
 I don't party on Saturday no more 
 I don't party on Friday night 
 I don't party on Saturday no more 
 I ain't hit the club, drinking at the crib with the bros 
 Pinching all the ounce from the plug 
 Shorty so sweet, sour tooth from your kiss girl 
 Mind is clear when we lay down 
 Shorty understands me, I'm safe in your arms now 
 First time for a lot of things now 
 Shorty you got me weak, weak, weak, yeah 
 She understands me 
 What goes on in my life 
 What goes on in my mind 
 (She understands me) 
 They said you should take time 
 That's why I'm giving her mine 
 And it's undivided, -ed, -ed, yeah 
 Its undivided, -ed, -ed, whoa undivid- 
 Running in sauce, flavour, me and my shorty we up 
 Cut some heads off Medusa's, feel like Breezy chucking up the deuces 
 If I love her again I'm foolish, wall juke you, NFL street 2 shit 
 She knew about me and I knew about her, and since I found you I've been booling 
 Booling, cruising like the King that I made myself yeah 
 Rocking up my city for my ride 
 Thinking about myself and I love myself a lot so I feel like Kanye sometimes 
 In the west side with you rolling Cali bud, we ain't got no drama since we got our money up 
 I've told you about the things I'm scared of and they don't trouble you and that's because 
 You understand me 
 What goes on in my life 
 What goes on in my mind 
 She understands me 
 They said you should take time 
 That's why I'm giving her mine 
 And it's undivided, -ed, -ed, yeah 
 Its undivided, -ed, -ed, whoa 
 You wanted, you wanted, you wanted it as much as I 
 You wanted, you wanted it 
 You wanted, you wanted, you wanted it as much as I 
 You wanted, you wanted it 
 You wanted, you wanted, you wanted it as much as I 
 As much as I as much as 
 You wanted, you wanted it
