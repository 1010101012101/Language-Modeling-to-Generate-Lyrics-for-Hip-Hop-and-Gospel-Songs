 Thought I turn you down when I can make you mine 
 Unexplained feeling that I ain't really get into yet 
 Is there anything else you gotta tell me now 
 I don't wanna talk 'bout it 'cause we'll both get too into it 
 All I'm thinking bout is you and I don't know why I've been doing it 
 The feelings you gave me, craving them daily

 No, what about afterwards 
 Only going forward with you

 About the same feeling
