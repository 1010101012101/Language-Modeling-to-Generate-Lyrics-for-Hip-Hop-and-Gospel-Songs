I ain't tryin' to fall vitcim to the haters 
 Just trying give you my life on one piece of paper 
 Mama 
 For they take me let me tell you one thing 
 Ya baby boy is a soldier and I run things 
 Sorry I didn't become a doctor or a lawyer 
 High as hell 
 Going to school with the sig sauer 
 Its hard to figure whos real and whos counterfeit 
 Streets love ya boy I'm like the president round this bitch 
 Each summer 
 I sat and watched these niggas rise 
 Watch these niggas fall 
 And watch these niggas die 
 Watch these niggas grow 
 Watch these niggas multiply 
 I'm talkin' bout these pussy niggas real nigga till I die 
 You can call me the mozart on these streets 
 Conduct a whole fucking symphony on these beats 
 Bay area stand up 
 You got the right to do it 
 It's a little bit more than the hyphy movement 
 Who gon' pull my car 
 Who gon' call me out 
 I'm in the game now you gon' have to haul me out 
 Who gon' bust that shot 
 Who gon' pull that knife 
 I'm seen everywhere and I ain't never tuck my ice 
 I'm that nice 
 Ask ya lil brother 
 Ask any rapper that's been on the source or xxl cover 
 They'll tell you I'm nothing less than the truth 
 And tell you ya boy is a beast in that booth 
 The truth gotta be told 
 I tell the whole world 
 I know ya tired of the same old song girl 
 I sat at home and watched game bring the west back 
 I told him to put half of California on my fuckin' back 
 Half of washington 
 Part of nevada 
 Give me every city from portland to tiauhana 
 Let me carry the west too 
 Ya boy put his heart on every single track just like the best do 
 I don't never run and hide like the rest do 
 I stand and fight 
 Got my gun and my vest too 
 You heard the name before 
 You know the name ya boy 
 There ain't an MC alive that I can't destroy 
 And missed the bus I've been rapping since my teen days 
 Black wall mix tape 
 Xxl freepage 
 The source unsigned hype 
 And one skee tape 
 Now I bet them labels come runnin' like a freed slave
