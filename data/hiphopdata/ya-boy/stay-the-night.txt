(No one can stop us) 
 Yeah, Ya Boy 
 I want to thank David Foster 
 For letting me bring this platinum back 
 Let's get it, yeah 
 (Stay the night) when the moon come up 
 It's time for me to go home, but she still want me to 
 (Stay the night) I been with her all day 
 Been committed all day but she still say 
 (Stay the night) she lettin' me know that 
 She don't want me to go, she keep tellin' me ta 
 I'm a stay with ya, I'm a get paid with ya 
 I'm a stay with ya, I'm a get paid with ya 
 I wake up every day with the same plans 
 She's on my mind and there's no other game plan 
 I'm always with her I could never be a changed man 
 And I been knowin' this since back in the days man 
 My grandmother used to tell me she was dangerous 
 But people was gettin' money on her and gettin' paid and shit 
 I said I want money too, I'm a mess with you 
 I said holla at Ya Boy, she like what it do 
 From New York to California people grind on ya 
 And they never stop, even though a stop sign is on ya 
 I'm a take my time and flick nicks and dimes on ya 
 I ain't tryin' to unwind but she keep cryin' like won't ya 
 (Stay the night) when the moon come up 
 It's time for me to go home, but she still want me to 
 (Stay the night) I been with her all day 
 Been committed all day but she still say 
 (Stay the night) she lettin' me know that 
 She don't want me to go, she keep tellin' me ta 
 I'm a stay with ya, I'm a get paid with ya 
 I'm a stay with ya, I'm a get paid with ya 
 I ain't even goin' lie dog, I think I love her 
 I might even just put her on my CD cover 
 Squeeze and hug her even share her with my little brother 
 She want me to stay from sundown 'til the sun come up 
 Don't let her looks fool you, she get bad at night 
 If you with her you might get grabbed at night 
 Shot and stabbed at night, she took that med that night 
 So if you're scared do like Stacey, dash at night (ha ha ha) 
 I never beat her I told her I never leave her 
 When there's nowhere else to go, that she's there whenever I need her 
 I like to get high, she there growin' my reefer 
 Gettin' Franklin's like Aretha she tellin' me don't leave her (please) 
 (Stay the night) when the moon come up 
 It's time for me to go home, but she still want me to 
 (Stay the night) I been with her all day 
 Been committed all day but she still say 
 (Stay the night) she lettin' me know that 
 She don't want me to go, she keep tellin' me ta 
 I'm a stay with ya, I'm a get paid with ya 
 I'm a stay with ya, I'm a get paid with ya 
 If you love her like I do, and hug her like I do 
 Then you know what this song implies to 
 Them other type of people they be hatin' on her 
 'Cause they know Ya Boy affiliated with her, chyeah 
 This for my people on the corner 
 Get your money on her from NYC to Arizona 
 From Florida all the way to California 
 The whole wide world from Tacoma to Barcelona 
 Make small moves if you're slick you's a goner 
 I'm a be fine 'cause she knows I'm a soldier 
 She's my bitch for life, we don't ever fight 
 And my bitch don't ever say goodnight, she say 
 (Stay the night) when the moon come up 
 It's time for me to go home, but she still want me to 
 (Stay the night) I been with her all day 
 Been committed all day but she still say 
 (Stay the night) she lettin' me know that 
 She don't want me to go, she keep tellin' me ta 
 I'm a stay with ya, I'm a get paid with ya 
 I'm a stay with ya, I'm a get paid with ya 
 (Stay the night) It's Ya Boy
