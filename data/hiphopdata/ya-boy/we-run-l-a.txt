One for the money, two for the show. 
 Hit the Louis store right on Rodeo. 
 White SL, the colour of Yayo 
 Pass the cup to my girl and told her to sip slow. 
 This my show, watch me baby, The way I go can't stop me baby 
 Seatbelt beside me baby, LA just drive me crazy. 
 We could float through the city night, I'm drunk and your lookin' real pretty right. 
 Make love I ain't finna fight. 
 Not once, we can go till we get it right. 
 What it cost I can fit the price 
 Got a house in hills you can spend the night. 
 When they ask who turns you out. 
 She came from over-seas 
 To be a star on the boulevard 
 She wants sex on the beach 
 We can share, its only fair 
 I've got paradise on call, its ours, its ours! 
 She got a little taste and she wants more, some moreee 
 We run L.A! 
 Yeah, cut alot of girls, cut alot of cheques. 
 That's the life here on sunset. 
 Rich and famous I am success. 
 Met her at Les Deux and she do love sex. 
 Ima sip this, you do the rest 
 You know what you do, you do the best 
 Do me a favour, lose the dress 
 Its nice by the way, Chanel I guess. 
 LAMB handbags I know where they sell those. 
 Maybe later on we can hit Melrose. 
 All you gotta do is hit me on my cellphone. 
 Baby girl me and you can kick it like a field goal. 
 Know who I be, call me YB. 
 Red carpet I don't need the I.D 
 Cazals on my face, you don't see what I see 
 (Where) Girl you know where I be 
 (Where) Hollywood Swingin'

 (That's right) Hollywood Swingin' 
 (Where) Girl you know where I be

 She came from over-seas 
 To be a star on the boulevard 
 She wants sex on the beach 
 We can share, it's an all in affair 
 I've got paradise on call, its ours, its ours! 
 She got a little taste and she wants more, some moreee 
 We run L.A!
