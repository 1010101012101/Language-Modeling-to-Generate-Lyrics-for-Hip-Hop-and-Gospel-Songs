I'm not saying I'm gonna change the world 
 But I guarantee 
 That I will spark the brain 
 That will change the world 
 Better show respect before I lose it 
 The whole world know 
 Precise is more than music 
 A movement 
 Look at all the goons that I move with 
 Homies, guns, vest and boots 
 On that platoon shit 
 Best, artist in the west 
 Yes, liturally 
 The fans comparing me to who? 
 Come on, ya killin' me 
 The enemy keep tryin' 
 But can't get rid of me 
 Bombs like timothy 
 Arms like a centipede 
 Hoes through his door 
 Make sure he's a memory 
 One nigga 
 But I got em' shook 
 Like there's ten of me 
 Go hard in hip-hop 
 Hope they remember me 
 Screamin' "thug life" 
 Like a tupac many-me 
 Any beef? 
 Tell em' to bring it special delivery 
 I bet my little friend will put em' outta his misery 
 These niggas wanna finish me 
 And send me to the reverend 
 Honostly, there's probably better compitition in heaven 
 Holla at me 
 Filmore bitch 
 We dollar happy 
 You would think I was strippin' 
 The way hoes throw dollas at me 
 I'm the motha fuckin' spitful, delightful, iful 
 The new ice cube 
 Plus my guns 
 They rock mics too 
 So what's good? 
 Is you crip? 
 Or you blood? 
 Somebody call khaled 
 Tell em' "ya boy what's hood" 
 If he joke like deray 
 My heat like d. wade 
 Shots to his face 
 Make him sing like t-pain 
 Stuff him in the trunk 
 Then I dump the remains 
 Now days 
 All that rappin' is 
 Is a free-chain 
 If a nigga ever look at me as a free-chain 
 He's not gonna make it 
 Like his plane got delayed 
 I'm talkin' to the real 
 If you fake, then get lost 
 Them block muscle-men 
 Hustlin' like rick ross 
 Real talk 
 I'd rather sit 
 Then snitch dawg 
 Cause quick jaws 
 Get a nigga smoked 
 Like menthols 
 I'm way outta they league 
 Who's hotter than me? 
 Gottcha' favorite r&b bitch 
 Swollowin me 
 I ain't lyin' 
 Look I'm so fly 
 I should be flyin' 
 Maybe that's the reason 
 Why ya girl keep eyein' 
 I'm eyein' her back 
 Louie purse, with the hat 
 I'm not a trick 
 But I'm rich 
 So I'm buyin' her that 
 And I'm tired of this rap beef 
 Tired of that gay shit 
 I thought he wanted war 
 He seen me 
 And didn't say shit 
 I'm outta this world 
 When you see me 
 I'm like a spaceship 
 Lights everywhere 
 Make em' bright anywhere 
 Got the sun on my neck 
 Full moon on my wrist 
 Da-daimonds in my mouth 
 And it's all on a bitch 
 I guess I took notes from kevin federline 
 Everytime 
 Milk a bitch like a cow 
 Every cent 
 Every dime 
 Never been to jail 
 But I done, done hella crimes 
 Moved to malibu 
 Now I got em' thuggin' 
 At pepperdine 
 Gimme mine 
 If a nigga say I ain't the top five 
 Dead or alive 
 Remove his head 
 From his spine 
 I load the lead in the nine 
 Leave him dead on arrival 
 Ya sittin' on the shelf 
 What the fuck did ya sign for? 
 Catch me with the crips 
 And the bloods don't mind, no 
 I don't bang colors 
 I'm a damn albino 
 Drunk like a whino 
 Hard like a rhino 
 Flyin' through ya time zone 
 Lookin' for a fine hoe 
 Rihanna, alicia, mya, big pimpin' 
 I'll even take a white girl 
 Like jessica simpson 
 Make sure she licks it 
 Kiss my limp biscuit 
 Tape it 
 Need a witness 
 This is big business 
 I'm heavy with src's 
 Like steve rifkin 
 I'm talkin' some real clientel 
 Nigga listen! 
 Drop em' a line 
 That's all I do 
 Is go fishin' 
 Get em' hooked on me 
 Then I turn em' into fish sticks 
 This is 
 100 bars of death 
 If ya listenin' 
 I ain't like these other niggas 
 I can go the distance 
 Ya fans in my hands 
 So you know I'm gonna clinch it 
 The rap game's dirty 
 But somebody's gotta rinse it 
 I don't even spit shit 
 I just go and rip shit 
 That's why these hoes 
 Put me on like lipstick 
 That's why these hoes 
 Put ya boy on their hit list 
 Swag like a ma' fucka 
 I'm the new slick rick 
 La-de-da-de 
 Sawd-off shawty 
 Ridin' through the hood 
 Bout' to flip somebody 
 How you rap like that? 
 It's just somethin' bout' me 
 I step in the booth 
 And the shit just comes at me 
 Niggas wanna shoot me 
 Niggas wanna rob me 
 Fuck that! 
 40 cal. 
 Here right beside me 
 Niggas can't deny he 
 Hotter than mohave... desert 
 In the middle of summer 
 Let's have ménage à 
 I be 
 Killin' other rappers like a hobby 
 Niggas take pictures 
 Of women when they surround me 
 I don't even trip 
 I don't block no head 
 I tell them hoes 
 "Do me" 
 Like rocko said 
 But you can get up outta here 
 If you ain't got no bread 
 Cause even my bed 
 Gotta far-gomo spread 
 Yeah! 
 I mean skrudge may duck bucks 
 And if a nigga say I ain't nice 
 Then he probably get butt fucked 
 I see you in the hood 
 All I'll say is 
 "Tough luck" 
 Don't holla percise gang... 
 ... Ya get fucked up 
 What what? 
 Cut a nigga up 
 Like nip/tuck 
 You might as well kill ya self 
 Like a wrist cut 
 And everybody in the whole hood know 
 It's us 
 The way them doors no longer swing 
 They lift up 
 The way them boys 
 Gon' do they things with big bucks. 
 Big homes, big diamond rings, and big trucks 
 Despite that... 
 I'm tryna' sell like mike jack 
 I even get the fans that don't like rap 
 Keep it a hundred 
 If it's a must 
 I write that 
 Spit so much crack 
 The feds got the mic tapped. 
 Yeah 
 Holla at me 
 Percise gang! 
 Ya boy! 
 I suggest you keep me healthy 
 West coast 
 West coast... 
 ... I suggest you keep me healthy 
 Y.b. 
 I'm on one 
 Infra red on this 
 Motha fucka' 
 Yeah
