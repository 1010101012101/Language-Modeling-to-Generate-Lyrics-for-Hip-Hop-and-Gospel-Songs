(Feat. jin) 
 Ya boy: 
 Hey mama 
 Ya boy gettin' paid mama 
 Remember, it didn't used to be this way mama 
 But look, ya son drivin' escalade's mama 
 And after them shows ya son gettin' laid mama 
 I don't know what it is mayb the like me 
 But I've been suffering so long huh, the shit is frightening 
 People are star struck, I'm gettin' starbucks 
 But last year I couldn't afford starbucks 
 I went from honda cord to driving large trucks 
 Didn't really have a name I couldn't charge much 
 Nigga's overlookin the bay but that was our luck 
 Now I got sumthin to say and they on our nuts 
 I used to hustle on the block sellin 10 shots 
 And now I'm tradin my stocks at the rim shop 
 And the shit don't end no it's not stopping 
 I'm in new york with jin we got the set popping 
 (Chorus: ya boy (jin)) 
 Ay I've been down so long, so long, so long (its time for me to come up) [x4] 
 Ay I've been down so long, so long, so long (if you with me get up) 
 Jin: 
 I speak for the MC's so you can understand him 
 1 - 2 battle's now they call me 100 grand jin 
 Accept the fact that you can't win 
 It's a done deal now that I linked up with ya boy in st quin 
 You know cats will talk we just here to get it poppin' 
 And let the bay watch like david hasselhoff 
 Then go global with it hit your part of town 
 But you can't reach the sky if you don't start from the ground 
 Can you blame my confidence? 
 In 4 years I rocked about 36 states and 5 continents 
 That's all on the strength of my flow 
 Only suckers who measure skills based on the land of there dough 
 I represent the graphieus ask my man kay 
 He'll tell you right there I'm only 1 hit away 
 But you never know, shit this could be the song 
 Its time to come up I've been down so long 
 (Chorus: ya boy (jin)) 
 Ay I've been down so long, so long, so long (its time for me to come up) [x4] 
 Ay I've been down so long, so long, so long (if you with me get up) 
 Jin (ya boy): 
 So if you with me out there then please stand up 
 (And if you hustlin work then put your grands up) 
 But if you get locked and put on a stand stuck 
 (Remember snitchin ain't cool don't never give your man's up) 
 (And for my 9 to 5 workin I ain't mad at you) 
 Single baby mothers that gotta be the daddy too 
 (This is the anthem for the struggle in the grind) 
 Its jin 
 (Ya boy) 
 Its about time 
 (Chorus: ya boy (jin)) 
 Ay I've been down so long, so long, so long (its time for me to come up) [x4] 
 Ay I've been down so long, so long, so long (if you with me get up)
