You niggas square like a doorway 
 My fan base stretch from CA to Norway 
 I got it all, cars, hoes, and I got change 
 Livin' like a king, same age as Lebron James 
 Breakin these hoes wasn't enough so I copped haze 
 You other guys just mad 'cause you not paid 
 Who wanna rap? Believe I got word play 
 Ya Boy got more bars than a bird cage 
 And I'm stapped like a seatbelt, see 
 You want beef? I creep like TLC 
 Put a couple in they head, make sure they sleep 
 'Cause most of these dudes hoes, like females be 
 But I never get caught up in they bitch ways 
 For the quick pay believe, I flip like a switchblade 
 There's no hope for ya 
 When I put the scope on ya 
 Take ya lid off like a fuckin' can opener 
 Gangsta gangsta, Ya Boy so hood 
 Prince of the Bay 'cause my flow so good 
 You a tough dude hangin' on the yard with me 
 Got somethin' on my waist Ray Charles could see 
 That's right this is my territory 
 Watch where you step or get shot while ya tourin 
 Ain't no battle raps, pull the strap on cats while they talkin' 
 Yeah boy you could be the next dead man walkin' 
 (x2) 
 You can run up nigga test ya luck 
 Them hollow tips gun' mess you up 
 Vest on my chest, keep a hammer by my nuts 
 Trust me boy I don't give a fuck 
 (x2) 
 All these labels know Imma blow like a landmine 
 Show the whole globe fa sho its SanFran time 
 They though we was all tye-die shirts 
 Got the wrong idea boy, try my turf 
 I seen drugs get sold 
 Slugs get thrown 
 Still in the mix like coolaid in punch bowls 
 I'm rich at all times I don't blow my cake 
 Boy ya money fluxuate, like Oprah weight 
 Hold it straight 
 It's a fact while holdin' pape 
 Nine times outta ten friends known to hate 
 So I roll alone, I'm a rollin' stone 
 Somebody call the police, Ya Boy stole the show 
 And I'm not givin' it back, Imma hold it ransom 
 Gangsta raps grandson, hoes say I'm handsome 
 Yes yes it's the prince of the fuckin' Bay boy 
 Got my own website in the Escalade boy 
 That's right this is my territory 
 Watch where you step or get shot while ya tourin 
 Ain't no battle raps, pull the strap on cats while they talkin' 
 Yeah boy you could be the next dead man walkin' 
 (x2) 
 You can run up nigga test ya luck 
 Them hollow tips gun' mess you up 
 Vest on my chest, keep a hammer by my nuts 
 Trust me boy I don't give a fuck
