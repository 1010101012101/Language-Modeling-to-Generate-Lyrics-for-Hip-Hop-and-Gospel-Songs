I pull up on that girl like baby you like my wheels 
 Come, hop up in my car, lets take a ride through the hills 
 She's addicted to me because I get her high 
 I get her high, I get her high 
 I pull up on that girl like baby you like my wheels 
 Come, hop up in my car, lets take a ride through the hills 
 She's addicted to me because I get her high 
 I get her high, I get her high 
 (Ya Boy) 
 Fast Living, fast women 
 They like to dive in that money, look she back swimming 
 She back grinning 
 I'm cash spending (?) Rodeo Drive, 5th Ave'n it 
 I'm not your average I'm well established 
 And I can introduce you to good living and lavishness 
 Establishments, flashy whips 
 The baddest bitch, baby the man's a pimp 
 Why me, rockstar in the flesh 
 She never knew she had rockstars in the west 
 I never knew Marciano could make a perfect dress 
 How do you make it look like that, your the best 
 J12 Chanel baby, that watch nice 
 You know I'm famous, I put her in the spotlight 
 Lets hit the night spot then I hit the spot right 
 Get her in that thing and just go, no stop lights 
 I pull up on that girl like baby you like my wheels 
 Come, hop up in my car, lets take a ride through the hills 
 She's addicted to me because I get her high 
 I get her high, I get her high 
 I pull up on that girl like baby you like my wheels 
 Come, hop up in my car, lets take a ride through the hills 
 She's addicted to me because I get her high 
 I get her high, I get her high 
 (Ya boy) 
 I do my thing from the Range to the planes 
 I can't say that since I got money I've been the same 
 Sushi dinners, Miami summers 
 New York Winters, I'm a big spender 
 I get Louie delivered, Gucci flown in 
 We flew out, got our iPhone roaming 
 You knew how I did her, n-gga just check her twitter 
 I bet a million she say the rockstar with her 
 Yeah, lets hit Sunset before the sun sets 
 She ask what's next, well, baby I love sex 
 Rough sex, Wild sex, hot sex, 'bout sex 
 We in the bedroom banging like gunplay 
 Girl you taste like an ice cream sundae 
 We can wake up in the morning, do it all over 
 We in the fast lane until they pull the car over 
 I pull up on that girl like baby you like my wheels 
 Come, hop up in my car, lets take a ride through the hills 
 She's addicted to me because I get her high 
 I get her high, I get her high 
 I pull up on that girl like baby you like my wheels 
 Come, hop up in my car, lets take a ride through the hills 
 She's addicted to me because I get her high 
 I get her high, I get her high 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 Got her choice of any drug, she said I'm her favourite though 
 (?) Enough to go around, said she like to face it though 
 Just like a lady, drive Mercedes, got your own 
 So how can I be a bad influence, Miss we grown 
 You sending me pics with nothing but them Vicky's on 
 Sidekick sex, we iPhone bone 
 Butter taste it so she take it all the way down her throat 
 I'll make you famous, call you Miss but not an Oh, oh, ooh 
 And if ya n-gga got a problem, tell him see us, see us 
 She smell our aroma, sweet as California 
 Calling me her medicine, higher than she ever been 
 It was better than the weekend with the stars 
 Well, rou can have it all, get the dream house with the car 
 You and your girls, day spa, getting foot massages 
 Lot of rock 'n' roll, sex and the drugs...
