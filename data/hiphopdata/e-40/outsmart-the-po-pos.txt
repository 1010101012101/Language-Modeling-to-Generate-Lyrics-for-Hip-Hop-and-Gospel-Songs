(Yawn) (burp) 
 It's 9 AM (fuck) time for a poisima, 
 Life at incent, sit on the toiletsump 
 The Rossi got me smellin like I'm dead inside (sniff) 
 I'm stankin up the bathroom wit nuttin' to hide 
 I gotta go, flush the cumode, k, 
 Threw on the same damn clothes I woreyesterday 
 Me got some niggaz come down from outta town see 
 They want to meet me half way at the Nut Tree 
 But I'm starvin' so I'm Chargin' 
 15-5 for the Margerine, A-1 Yola tightly packed, 
 17-5 for the coochierack 
 Strike to the spot ride witta, my nine milameter bereta 
 The broad that be holdin' my D she love me, 
 Long as I keep dickin her down properly 
 Sittin' low in my cut not like a failure, 
 In front of baby's house 
 Straight talkin' on a cellular 
 Bring me out a unit, a birdie, a cake, 
 With the gypsyness before it's too late 
 Penitentury time drastic, here she come with a Kilo in a baby basket 
 Gotta play your cards right, game tight, 
 Can't be slippin in the 90's, damn right
