I was throwing a game with a shield and a sword 
 Started having money, buying things that I used to couldn't afford 
 At the beginning of my mannishness, I was the mannish-itz 
 I bought a nickel plated four fift' 
 Dautons, Granadas, Caddys and Fairlanes 
 Chevy, Impalas, Cutlass and Mustang 
 Donkey rows, jewelry like a Pharaoh 
 Troop jackets, DBoy Apparel 
 Hop, we speak, coke, whatever you need 
 You ought to add subtract but can barely read 
 No, I can't, yes, I did, no, I didn't 
 You think I'll be dead or successful or in prison 
 Triple beam scared while I was flipping the goop 
 Hella clientele, I was getting my loot 
 Concrete, I ain't made of feathers 
 Tear shit up just like some angry protesters 
 I come from the streets 
 Where they play for keeps 
 The strong and the weak 
 Gotta be concrete 
 I'm from the streets 
 Where every day they leak 
 Ambulance and police 
 Gotta be concrete 
 He started out fast, he came in last, went outta gas 
 But he was winning at first, what you call a person like that? 
 A quarter horse, enter the game and came when I left, a tortoise 
 That's domino talk, man, you a man, of course 
 You still in the game? Nah, we divorced 
 You make any change? No remorse 
 You're full of shit just like a port-a-potty 
 His hustle game's sloppy, tricking off them boppies 
 I'm for what's right, maybe that's what's wrong 
 That's what I was just telling my little homie on the phone 
 Be a leader, not a follower 
 And if you're going to be a follower, follow the right leader 
 Stop thinking with your peter 
 My peter? Yeah, your dick 
 Why? A chick will get you hit 
 Keep your eye on the sparrow 
 Get cornered and ambushed 
 They'll limit with your space, your space is narrow 
 I come from the streets 
 Where they play for keeps 
 The strong and the weak 
 Gotta be concrete 
 I'm from the streets 
 Where every day they leak 
 Ambulance and police 
 Gotta be concrete 
 He put his foot where is mouth is, good riddance 
 They would be yelling a drive-through, "A Kentucky Fried Chicken" 
 They wasn't gangbangin' but they was set tripping 
 Ate him up real good but he's still living 
 The victim's parents lawyer on a case for real 
 Tried to put the nigger who did it behind bars 
 And make him pay they doctor's bill 
 But the shooter a monster, he hella fear 
 So ain't nobody talking, listen here 
 Not only them 
 But the victim don't want nobody saying nothing anyway 
 Because when he get out and get his shit together 
 He gon' put them niggas under the weather 
 When it comes to feuding and funking, gotta be clever 
 Beefing, commotion and drastic measures, drastic measures 
 From the top of my head to the bottom of my feet 
 I don't know about you, but I'ma stay concrete 
 I come from the streets 
 Where they play for keeps 
 The strong and the weak 
 Gotta be concrete 
 I'm from the streets 
 Where every day they leak 
 Ambulance and police 
 Gotta be concrete
