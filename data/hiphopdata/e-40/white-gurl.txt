 White gurl [8x] I got dat whiiiiite gurl [3x] girl girl [8x] 
 Ooh I throw tha yola in tha pot let it simmer 'n' bave 
 Add a lil bakin soda make it foam like after shave 
 I like to serve my dope wet 'cause it weigh a hella lot more 
 U can smell the residue 'n' the fumes from next do' 
 Turf superstar, microwaves 'n' pickle jars 
 Potrtable digital scales, custom painted muscle cars 
 Pimpin' where the razor blade? use a safety pin 
 What they goin' fo'? nigga wutchu trynna spend? 
 When it's a drought, I jus sit on my dope 'n' wait 
 For the prices to sky rocket and rise like real estate 
 I got dat icecream, that candy, that girl, that white white white 
 My christler charger 2006 hemi tight tight tight 
 I'm a d-boi (booch) I thought you knew 
 Jus like every other mother fucker in my crew 
 Bundle in the bushes, chop her up in the tree 
 Ak will light up ur chest like ET 
 (Juelz Santana) 
 Now let me introduce the world to my girl 
 She white, she bright, she shines like a pearl 
 And I ain't talkin' bout Lindsay Lohan 
 I'm talkin' bout that sniff, that blow man 
 That 1 hit that will get you open 
 Might make ur nose bleed if it's potaint 
 So if ur not ready, homie don't tamper with it 
 She da chick who had Tony Montana slippin 
 She so bad, she make you mad 
 But soon as you get that, she make you cash (that white girl) 
 But she ain't always that light, she ain't always that bright, she ain't always that white 
 Gimme 1 girl, I mean 1 gram 
 I'll teach you how to give a white girl a sun tan 
 Put it in that pot, till it get dat hot, then start tha Sir-Mix-Alot (ight) 
 Well down in the dirty... south to be exact 
 Gettin' money with white girls is a well known fact 
 I like 'em black, brown, puerto rican or asian 
 But nothin' bring the bread back like a caucasian 
 Weather winter fall summer or spring 
 The white gurls always down for doin' the damn thing 
 Put her on the highway, she ain't no punk 
 Gotta white girl drivin' with white gurls in the trunk 
 I ain't lyin' it's the best thing goin' 
 When my white gurls around it's always snowin 
 Mama can't stand her tellin' me to switch 
 Sayin' imma go to jail fuckin' with that white bitch 
 Always around to keep me paid 
 With some white girls on my team I got it made 
 So if ur down on ur luck 'n' got no money 
 Then do what I do go get u a snow bunny 
 I got the pirex workin with the white girl in it 
 It's the dope super bowl 'n' nigga I'm bout to win it 
 ?? 
 When we through with this badge we goin' out to the bahamas 
 I keep a silk braud wen I'm fuckin' wit the hard 
 'Cause the never get stopped my the motha fuckin' cops 
 Fools look hard but the bitches is fraud 
 Don't like to see me ball, want me to go rock from rock 
 Move around bitch you need to get out the way 
 I keep a young suzi when its time to move yay 
 U need to learn the game before you try to play 
 Like cab gone those laws will take you away 
 So I keep me a snow bunny ridin' in the front 
 With a triple zillion head in a platnum cup 
 U already know they eat nuts like a squrril 
 Lemme hit you in ur head 'n' bust nuts in ur curl white girl
