My rear view mirror is vibrating (echo: vibrating) x2 
 The beat keeps knockin' down my rearview mirror 
 E-40: 
 Say uh, 
 Which way should I steer uh? 
 The beat keeps knockin' down my rear view mirror 
 Blankin like a motherf***a swervin' 
 Hope I don't ? in my 2010 suburban 
 Beatch! 
 My right pocket be feudin with my left pocket 
 'Cause my left pocket be havin' a thumper in it 
 My left pocket be feudin with my right pocket 
 'Cause my right pocket be havin' mo money in it 
 See that chick right there? she a lil ol' slut 
 She said e-40's a FILF. FILF? 
 Father I Like to F*** 
 I said "lil girl, you way too young for me 
 What you need to do is go and get your mommy 
 I heard she's got some vicious dome action 
 Gobble game is fire 
 Suction cup lips, suck the air out a tire" 
 Hips butt tits b***h call me sire 
 And I won't stop Mack-in' till I retire 
 Beatch! 
 B-Legit: 
 It's cookies in my swisher 
 Boy like the blunt 
 It's dub 7s in my trunk bout to make s*** jump 
 I do my own stunts, this my favorite one 
 Dick stickin in the same position till the b***h c*m 
 And baby I'm the one, cold as a glacier 
 Heart like coal in the soul of a gangster 
 And I can make you famous 
 Better yet dangerous 
 Courageous, leave the game so contagious 
 Outrageous, amazin', I keep the sh** blazin' 
 Can't nobody face 'em only money can persuade 'em, 
 Bottles by the cases, models get wasted, 
 Diamonds in my chain, some more up in my bracelet 
 Pocket full of paper 
 Miss me with that fake sh** 
 The 40 cal will spit till somethin' get hit 
 Honor thy mother, but f*** these b***hes 
 I keep the game vicious, I'm ridiculous (I'm ridiculous)
