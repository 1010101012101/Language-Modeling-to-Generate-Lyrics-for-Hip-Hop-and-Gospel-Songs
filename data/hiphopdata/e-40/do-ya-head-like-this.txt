 (Doe - Verse 2) 
 This is a discipline rap for my niggaz back in tha bin 
 Tryin' to hustle for the tin 
 A discipline tracks for my niggaz that rap 
 But now I'm back and I hope ya don't do that ... 
 Soul is the heart of it I hope I can get every lil bit of it 
 But sometimes ya gotta slow it down 
 Like the few MC's that do shows in my town 
 Back in 2000 the rap game was lackin 
 Like some of them rappers bringin' two steps back in 
 But today is the day for hunger in the game 
 It ain't 'bout the fame it's all about the brains 
 And if you got that and yo rhymes are phat 
 Gone on head and do that 
 But ya always gotta think ... 
 Oh you thought I stopped rappin' 
 Put yo money back in the bank on my rank I'm numba 1 
 You is numba 2 I don't know what cha gone do 
 Ya gotta think it threw but too all my MC's 
 Back in the game this shit it like it was back in the day 
 I'm bout to thorw the fist all my hoes do ya head like this {oh} 
 (Chorus - E-40) 
 Do ya head like this, do ya head like this 
 Do ya head like this, do ya head like this 
 Do ya head like this, do ya head like this 
 Now gas break dip dip, gas break dip dip 
 Do ya head like this, do ya head like this 
 Do ya head like this, do ya head like this 
 Do ya head like this, do ya head like this 
 (E-40 - Verse 3)

 Use ur mouth like ur in a bath ridin' on a rath 
 But to all my niggaz in the pin and some wating to get it in

 Super hyipihe in this bitch smokin' on da litch
