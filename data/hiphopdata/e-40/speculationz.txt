Speculation has it, that I'm the freakiest one 
 I like to rip out my tongue and spit the black magic 
 And I'm supposed to be fucking some crack addict without a rubber? 
 And I already got a baby by her mother? 
 They say I'm a sci-fi wizard of sorts 
 And my momma, she was a banshee, she was drowned by the courts 
 They say my little brother Jamie, he's dead and in a grave, and I'm all alone and afraid 
 And everything I gave has been so underestimated, I've been hated by generations 
 For having conversations with people who didn't make it 
 How could I fake it? 
 I'm a monster, remember me? The weirdo with the axe, from another galaxy 
 I keep a blender in my kitchen filled to rim with the blood 
 And spit suspicions of me drinking it up 
 So it's fucked, scatter stones, get out my cool-Aid 
 I'm blasting away from all you haters 
 Hit me up on my two-way 
 (Chorus:Repeat x4) 
 Besides some bullshit falling down 
 I'm okay 
 Speculation has it that I'm a drunk and a drug addict 
 A shit talker, always trying to start static 
 A borderline faggot, with long fingernails 
 Either that or he's a coke head, but I don't think he cares 
 Speculation has it that I have already engaged in sexually fantasies with me and Gwen Stefani 
 A video taping, internet downloads 
 Speculations is called is the one who gets boned 
 I can't escape it, mistake it, or fake it out 
 Look you in the face as if I don't know what you talking about 
 Speculation, you heard I don't spit on no bodies shit, but no, don't hate me 
 Many mouths to feed, and many personalities, and me looking to get P.A.I.D 
 Is it a lie or is it true? 
 You can put that on our skills they stay snug like my Batman suit 
 (Chorus:Repeat x4) 
 Smash the flash I have the plastic backing 
 Speculation, hateration, me and Twiztid don't give a 
 Mistaking, papered up, smashing independently 
 With a dedicated ass fanbase, and don't a mothafucka hear from me 
 Speculation, see they just don't know 
 I be rapping too fast, they be listening too slow 
 I be spitting sluggish 
 E-40 be spitting thuggish 
 E-40 be representing the bottery up in the cop, got the dirt popping 
 Ain't no stopping a pimp 
 Walk with a limp 
 Elbows on bimp 
 Flopping on hips 
 Sipping on sip, sipping on sip 
 Dipping and skating and bounce to this shit 
 Me and Twiztid be twisted 
 Me and Twiztid be gone 
 Me and Twiztid be blisted 
 Me and Twiztid be stoned 
 Gone on our head, dead, dead wrong 
 Smoking turtle, beating on our chest like King Kong 
 Conversating acting and poking, that's how it's hanging today 
 Trying to persuade this liquor into giving me brain 
 (Chorus:Repeat x4)
