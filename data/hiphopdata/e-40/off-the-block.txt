Oh, these hard time 
 Just tryin' to get by, tryin' to get by 
 Tryin' to get by, tryin' to get by woo 
 We don't stop, always running from the cops 
 Praying night and day selling rocks, gotta make it out 
 It's ugly try to make it off the block 
 We don't stop, always running from the cops 
 Praying night and day selling rocks, gotta make it out 
 It's ugly try to make it off the block 
 Off the course of my religion I try not to go to prison 
 Wash out... shoot with precision 
 My vision never missing with just the rightful ammunition 
 These double do studs go though your liquor man 
 We created this sequel despite our skin and our pigment 
 One day I hope to become legitimate, legitimate 
 That's the thought process of a young hustler about his money 
 Far form the dumb smart enough to run and become 
 If I was put in position and in results to be looping 
 No more life on the run, living life as a fugitive 
 I register marijuana smoking my lungs 
 Decrease the stress, got a mistress in Malibu 
 Let the past to blast 
 Then I take out the bottle put it on my head and chest 
 To protect me from death 
 It gruesome out here, it's spooky ugly and murkily 
 It's dirty out here 
 We don't stop, always running from the cops 
 Praying night and day selling rocks, gotta make it out 
 It's ugly try to make it off the block 
 We don't stop, always running from the cops 
 Praying night and day selling rocks, gotta make it out 
 It's ugly try to make it off the block 
 I went off the block, you ain't no better than me 
 My sins ain't no worse than yours, only father that I can judge me 
 I heard somebody say I'm sick of they urban deeds 
 The dreads and the saggy pants, I've had it up to here 
 I said why y'all show your drugs and wear them up to here 
 Got your bitches and criticism we trapped in the system 
 It's not a lot of school but it's a lot of prisons 
 By big homey went though with me and just like me and you 
 Hoping and wishing for financial breakthrough 
 Where I'm coming from you gotta be street smart not dumb 
 Put your hands up, don't run cops will shoot you with a gun 
 Consequences everyone makes mistakes 
 What's between today and tomorrow is your faith 
 It gruesome out here, it's spooky ugly and murkily 
 It's dirty out here 
 We don't stop, always running from the cops 
 Praying night and day selling rocks, gotta make it out 
 It's ugly try to make it off the block 
 We don't stop, always running from the cops 
 Praying night and day selling rocks, gotta make it out 
 It's ugly try to make it off the block 
 Off the block, try and make it off the block 
 The markers in yellow tape, bodies outline in chalk 
 Trying to take off the top, we stressing, depressing 
 Nobody to ask us a question 
 The government treat us like peasants 
 Can't get a job, 
 But now you get on jail on purpose just to get a decent meal 
 Stop chasing this high you can get some get back 
 With a strong guy got a monkey on his back 
 I see it all the time 
 The people that help they must be the ones that give the hardest time 
 That's some, shit 
 Act like you owe 'em some, you don't owe 'em shit 
 It gruesome out here, it's spooky ugly and murkily 
 It's dirty out here 
 We don't stop, always running from the cops 
 Praying night and day selling rocks, gotta make it out 
 It's ugly try to make it off the block 
 We don't stop, always running from the cops 
 Praying night and day selling rocks, gotta make it out 
 It's ugly try to make it off the block 
 I'm tryin' to get off the block, I'm tryin' to get off the block
