 My shit bang, my shit throb 
 I'm a muthafuckin beast, I'm a muthafuckin hog 
 Pull up with the slump 
 Or should I say blapp 
 Trunk sounding like I got a alligator in the back 
 Paint wetter than melted ice, ralley and hockey stripes 
 Burning rubber at every light, mean mugging like fuck yo life' 
 I be hustling all day and night, pushing all night and day 
 Twisted and whippin yay, getting my gwopalay 
 So you put my Gouda my pay, bet' not get in my way 
 From da Bay to L.A. to the A this nigga connected 
 Worldwide nigga this mister have you beheaded 
 You ain't gotta like me but you gotta respect it 
 Woke up early in the morning and put one in the air 
 Got so high thought about running for mayor 
 Slap myself to make sure I was still there 
 Shit, showered and shaved then I cut my hair 
 Today I'm try'na get laid then put a pounding on the monkey 
 Try'na find me a bitch with a ass like a Worldstahiphop bunny 
 Try'na get rich in this collectings stack my money 
 You can tell that I'm a D-boy by my baller tummy 
 Sometimes I dress uppity, sometimes I dress skummy 
 Sometimes I dress high class, sometimes I dress bummy 
 If it ain't about no cash you can miss me 
 Most of the time you can find a hustla tipsy 
 BIATCH! Biatch

 UGH! I been running around all day try'na get my decimals up (UH) 
 Anybody that try to stop me I suggest that they duck 
 'Cause when I get to buckin I can assure you it's nothing pleasant 
 My arsenal game is east but the west has all kinda of relatives 
 Even if you're wearing chest protection a trauma plate won't work 
 'Cause I'm a aim at your helmet, I ain't goin' aim at your shirt 
 Alot of these bitch ass niggas should be wearing a skirt 
 With the box of Motrinn and some maxi pads in they purse 
 Pillow talking and biting pillows, acting like some brassies 
 'Cause they're a whole bunch of that sucka shit a bunch of popsicles 
 I should have been a taurus 'cause I'm stubborn as a bull 
 I'm a different type of dude and I stick to the rules 
 I'm a real nigga best believe it, I live it and I breathe it 
 I tell it like it is and I call it how I see it 
 My potna used to be sharp but now he on fefe 
 'What do fefe mean? ' Methamphetamine 
 I can't believe it, man you disappointed me 
 I'm devastated mayne he lost cool points with me 
 I'm standing outside of my crib with some gym shorts and a hoody 
 Talking to my nig on the celly smoking a philly 
 Sipping on a fifth of that oil cognac henny 
 A hundred wall on them bricks, he got caught with a kid of candies 
 If you didn't go to jail by now he probably be dead 
 So instead he in there with his uncle his daddy and relatives 
 UHH!
