I been waiting, I been waiting, I been waiting way too long 
 My team way too strong, we on the grind and we coming for you 
 God damn I smoke way too strong, I just ripped that bong 
 That high grade got me paranoid 
 I swear these haters spoke too soon 
 Now when I walk in the room there's no choice but to love the boy 
 Gone for a minute time to fill the void 
 I'm a grown ass man ho you still a boy 
 Been here quite some time so when I write these rhymes 
 I feel like I'm finna take flight 
 Niggas can't block my shine 
 You better off trying to go swim with a great white 
 Little Jamey couple freaks it's a great night 
 Stack my money from the floor we the same height 
 Yeah, Two clubs in the same night 
 Kobe Bryant, Micheal Jordan I'm in the game light 
 We the last of the real (We the last of the real) 
 It ain't 'bout money, it ain't 'bout me 
 And that's on the real (And that's on the real) 
 They know we in the game wanna ask how I feel 
 We the last of the real (We the last of the real) 
 They know we in the game wanna ask how I feel 
 We the last of the real (We the last of the real) 
 They know we in the game wanna ask how I feel 
 We the last of the real (We the last of the real) 
 Where the real niggas from the Bay 
 I'm tired of broke rappers name dropping Mac Dre 
 Stop fronting, it makes no sense 
 If you ain't talking about money what you talking about pimp 
 Made my first million when I hit 22 
 Hoes still choosing even with the chipped tooth 
 My new work said she went to school with Su 
 I'm a real OG still doing what it do 
 Kingpin's coming home, youngsters don't care 
 They ain't never seen a real street millionaire 
 Like Short Dog, I'm still in the house bitch 
 50 thousand on the jewerly, 100 dollars on the outfit 
 They steady choosing you know it they love the macking 
 It's platinum on top of platinum I'm rapping they know it's happening 
 Young Su, 40 water what's up 
 That's why they wanna be like us 
 We the last of the real (We the last of the real) 
 It ain't 'bout money, it ain't 'bout me 
 And that's on the real (And that's on the real) 
 They know we in the game wanna ask how I feel 
 We the last of the real (We the last of the real) 
 They know we in the game wanna ask how I feel 
 We the last of the real (We the last of the real) 
 They know we in the game wanna ask how I feel 
 We the last of the real (We the last of the real) 
 We the last of the real and you'll never know how I feel 
 'Cause you ain't real only thing on my mind is skrill 
 What's that, dividends 
 Bay area niggas been setting trends 
 I got more friends in the pen than I do in the streets 
 If it wasn't for my pen I'd locked up or deceased 
 I'm polished they wonder why I'm so wise 
 Got my game from the OGs, who is that, the older guys 
 I love the work that's all I know 
 (How was you raised?) 
 Raised in the mud hella poor, diabetic 
 Used to put lotion on my grandma's toe 
 Why, cause it had a hole in it 
 I rep that 707 it's either hell or it's heaven 
 Where I'ma go I don't know 
 Real I see a dove or a crow 
 Watching out for the rifle it's called survival 
 Where your hands at? 
 One hand on the pistol one hand on the bible 
 We the last of the real (We the last of the real) 
 It ain't 'bout money, it ain't 'bout me 
 And that's on the real (And that's on the real) 
 They know we in the game wanna ask how I feel 
 We the last of the real (We the last of the real) 
 They know we in the game wanna ask how I feel 
 We the last of the real (We the last of the real) 
 They know we in the game wanna ask how I feel 
 We the last of the real (We the last of the real)
