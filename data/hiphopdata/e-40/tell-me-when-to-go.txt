Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go... 
 Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go... 
 Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb 
 (Verse 1: E-40) 
 Ooh. Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake em 
 I ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some 
 Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb 
 Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones (eeerrrrr!) 
 Ooh, tell me when to go (dumb) 
 Talking on my Ghettro on the way to the store 
 ... My 2nd or 3rd trip 
 Some Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips 
 Dr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts 
 Not just the cops, but the homies you got to watch 
 The moon is full, look at the dark clouds 
 Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild... Ta-dow 
 I don't bump mainstream, I knock underground 
 All that other shit, sugar-coated and watered down 
 I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb 
 From the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from 
 Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go... 
 Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go... 
 Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb 
 (Verse 2: Keak Da Sneak) 
 I'm off that 18 dummy juice 
 ... Yadamean, labeled the Black Zeus 
 King of the super dooper hyphy (hyphy, hyphy, hyphy, hyphy) 
 And your wife, she don't like me (like me, like me, like me, like me) 
 >From the Bay to the A 
 Put me in the back wood, Swisher sweet bud, orange lace (Let's go, it's dope) 
 Bitches wish I wrote, I said they couldn't be saved by John the Pope (John the Pope) 
 I slid past on the gas, bitches looking at me 
 It's good, it's good like the granddaddy 
 Cross game, you get flipped like a burger patty 
 Or zig-zagged... pass me a big old fatty 
 ... I drink white, with a snow bunny 
 Talking big shit in the scraper, going hella dummy 
 1800, Jose Cuervo 
 Yadada mean, yadada I'm saying though 
 Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go... 
 Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go... 
 Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb 
 (Outro: E-40) 
 (X4) Ghost-ride the whip 
 (X8) Now... Scrape 
 (X4) Put your stunna shades on 
 (X2) Now... Gas, brake, dip, dip 
 (X4) Shake them dreads 
 (X4) Let me see you show your grill 
 (X4) Now... Thizz face 
 (X4) Doors open, mayne 
 (X4) Now... Watch 'em swang 
 (X2) Go stupid, go (dumb, dumb) 
 Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go... 
 Tell me when to go... Tell me when to go... 
 Go dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
