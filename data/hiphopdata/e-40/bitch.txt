Nigga don't act like a BITCH 
 That's why I don't got love for a BITCH 
 Oh that's why too short & E-40 say BITCH 
 (Biatch!) 
 So homie please don't marry that BITCH 
 (Don't do it) 
 That's why I'll never be a BITCH 
 (Verse 1: Too $hort) 
 See me I get everything I wanna get 
 I have some fun with it and make her mama trip 
 'Cause if I'm in her life, it's a problem 
 A real players got your girl you better sock them 
 Turn your back on the bitch, she ain't actin' right 
 He hit it way before you now he's back in her life 
 Whatchu gon' do when you lose her? she gotta nigga on the side just to use her 
 If it's me I'm parkin' at the front door 
 And you be knockin' on her bedroom window 
 You see the shadows you hear 
 The sounds but you don't 
 Do nothing you just turn back around like a BITCH 
 (Biatch!) 
 Feelings hurt ready to cry, you can't believe everything she said was a lie 
 She got a lot of bitch in her but not more than you 
 I never underestimate 
 Nigga don't act like a BITCH 
 That's why I don't got love for a BITCH 
 Oh that's why too short & E-40 say BITCH 
 (Biatch!) 
 So homie please don't marry that BITCH 
 That's why I'll never be a BITCH 
 (Verse 2: E-40) 
 It's all good 
 Never sippin' 'n' slippin' 'n' skippin' 'n' drippin' 'n' missin' (missin') 
 This bastard I be hangin' around don't listen (listen) 
 I be hippen and sippen and smoking and drinking and spittin' (spittin') 
 But the musty mouth broads they be trippin' (trippin') 
 I mean the bitch thought she was bad 
 But I don't know what that batch was thinkin' 
 What she thought she was thinkin' but she shouldn't have thought that 
 I told her the money cost to much I ain't got it down 
 You gotta pay me 
 Or pay me no, never mind 
 Ah ah 
 Goes inventory when I go piss 
 You got feminine tendencies like a bitch 
 Me (me) I'm solid as concrete I keep it soft [?] 
 We (we) keep pearl up or something back in the dark 
 She (she) liftin' her dress up showin' her monk 
 See (see), he trippin', he trickin' throwin' her mon--- 
 B (b) I t c h all in her face 
 E (E) 40 so late, stay on the case 
 Nigga don't act like a BITCH 
 That's why I don't got love for a BITCH 
 Oh that's why too short & E-40 say BITCH 
 (Biatch!) 
 So homie please don't marry that BITCH 
 That's why I'll never be a BITCH 
 (Talking till end)
