 When I first started off niggas had me fucked, muthafuckas was blind 
 In '89 that ol "Mr. Flamboyant" shit was way ahead of his time 
 Had everyone an they great grandmas off that Carlos Rossi wine 
 Was in a major label an business that uh didn't want us to shine 
 It was me an my potna from Suave House Records 
 Tony Draper, E-40, an The Click 
 8-Ball, an MJG gettin' that independent paper 
 All about my ruh-uh-rap, uh-should I shine 
 Beat a muthafucka uh-duh-down, e'ry time 
 40 get yo marbles man, get yo change 
 Take a limosuine everywhere you go and fly private planes 
 That's what I was taught to do 
 By my big homie thou 
 You can always be a nigga, 
 But a nigga ain't rich till he can't count his money no mo' 
 Over night sensation, never me 
 All you "Record Haters" got Ph.IV 
 My niggas 3X Krazy laced me 
 Taught me how to say "fa sheezy" 
 Told me that them AZ muthafuckas don't believe phat means greasy 
 We can shoot it out, or we can fight 
 You an Rasheeda wanna squash the funk? 
 Shoot me some peace bitch! 
 Record Hatin' bitches! 
 (Record hatin' bitches!) 
 Suave game and snitches!

 (That's right.) 
 We should cease you from existence 
 (Learn about it.) 
 Niggas like that shouldn't be livin'. 
 (That's right.)
