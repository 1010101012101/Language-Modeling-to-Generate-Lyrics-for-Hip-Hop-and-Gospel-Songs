 Bout to hit the club (club) 
 Been mobbing all day 
 Drinkin' on some russle dying on some protome 
 Vip stats straped with my chrome 
 Looking around the club 
 What do I see 
 Everybody rocking side to side to the beat 
 Snapping they fingers bouncing to the groove all by themselves 
 That's the new move nigga where I'm from we like to go dumb 
 I'm smoking up the game I'm seeing how its done 
 Eh shorty what they call it the poo palce 
 Straight from bank head

 Rolling up the cush putting it in the air 
 I'm throwing up the e letting them know we in here 
 Brand new shoes brand new tone 
 Pull out the old school 
 'Cause I'm feeling real cool 
 Yeah I'm from the a so I'm leaning and rocking 
 Snapping my fingers then reaching for my glock (bitch) 
 Repping my block 
 Straight from the deck 
 When you snap yo fingers shorty gotta jerk yo neck 
 Smoking on the best we don't fuck with that mess 
 Bet you can't do it do it do it like this 
 Yeah I'm back to the track back to the snap 
 One two snap then gotta lean back

 In the a town (and if you ain't know)
