Yeah, get it in the morning, yeah, yeah, 
 'Cause I'm so serious, get it in the morning 
 'Cause I'm so serious 
 So serious listen miller if you want you hustling money for real 
 You gonna bounce back if you got get back squeal 
 Fuck all that whipping and ? and crime? 
 I'ma make it do what it do get out and get my grind 
 I'm on that graveyard shift my water feel pass me 
 'Cause when I try to stay focus got a 24 hours notice on my? 
 Business is slow, I speak the truth will pressure out the roof 
 A long way from being recession 
 I'm going through 
 I ain't trying to be a deadbeat dad I want my kids to have a better life than I had 
 My cellular off, loosen more minutes over my limit 
 Had the money but bought ...of weed that I can flip it 
 Man I ? cause that's what some of us black folks do 
 Instead of ? we gonna buy the new jordan shoe 
 Milk and diapers and baby wipes cost an arm and a leg 
 A breast of wing and a? 
 Hustle trying to get by, 
 Hey don't underestimate me, 
 A couple of days is all is gonna take me 
 'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that 
 I drop it off and it come right back 
 I get it in the morning 
 Don't underestimate me, 
 A couple of days is all is gonna take me 
 'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that 
 I drop it off and it come right back 
 I get it in the morning 
 I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired of being broke 
 I'm sick of this sequel 
 Man I swear I hate ? till them people brought down on my luck 
 And got a ? on my name, dirty testing I'm pissing in a cup, what the fuck 
 They found weed in my system, I told my girl I was quitting 
 They sent me back to san quentin for 90 days 
 Did my time and got out, now I'm in the unemployment line trying to figure shit out 
 But the penal system got me by the next? 
 With my troubled past I can't even get me a job 
 My partner rap he got his own record label they doing their thang 
 If I holler at him maybe he can shoot me some change 
 Plus I'm a loyal nigger man, I learn quick bro I ain't stupid 
 All you gotta do is show me 1 time and I can do it 
 My fellow put a hustle under his wine, show me the gang 
 Now I'm doing my thang 
 Hey don't underestimate me, 
 A couple of days is all is gonna take me 
 'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that 
 I drop it off and it come right back 
 I get it in the morning 
 Don't underestimate me, 
 A couple of days is all is gonna take me 
 'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that 
 I drop it off and it come right back 
 I get it in the morning 
 I'm trying to stay out of trouble and triple double quadruple this little change that I got 
 By throwing a few concerts 
 But I'm not too sure if I'm ready to spend this ? reason 
 Why is rap shows don't always go that way 
 Uh, and the chances are that I probably won't regroup 
 So I'ma take this loot and put some old school rnb soul groups 
 That way the value insurance won't be that high 
 And plus I'm minimizing the chance ...somebody dies, that's right 
 I got a homie that work at the toll bridge 
 He make good money, plus he get benefits 
 She been holling at me never the lesson 
 Trying to get a nigger a job there which is a blessing 
 But I don't think the homie really understand 
 I am an entrepreneur man I ain't working for no white man 
 Attitude of a hood boy, all my life I've been running from the ? I'm serious 
 Hey don't underestimate me, 
 A couple of days is all is gonna take me 
 'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that 
 I drop it off and it come right back 
 I get it in the morning 
 Don't underestimate me, 
 A couple of days is all is gonna take me 
 'Cause I'm so serious, and go like that 
 I drop it off and it come right back 
 I get it in the morning.
