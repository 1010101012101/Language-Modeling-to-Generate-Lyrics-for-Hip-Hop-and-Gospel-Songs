Bootsee let me define it you can rewind it after I finish spittin' 
 Now I want you to tell me if you know somebody in yo town that fit the description 
 A sucka, a ignorant mothafucka 
 One of them show boatin' high sidin' want to get some attention type nagas 
 Just as flashy but bitches be askin me 
 If they can borrow a couple of bucks until Tuesday 
 Pleases that man go say no man be tryin' to play Captain Save A Hoe 
 Gettin' marked by all them sneaky caniving ass set up hoes 
 You see bootsee is that ol' nigga with that ol' gold around his neck 
 Gold around his muthafuckin house, gold around his muthafuckin pet 
 Got everybody in the town thinkin' he sittin' nice on at least 20 ki's 
 But bootsee ain't movin nothin' but half thangs 
 Straight fuckin' with some of y'all niggas domes 
 Braggin and boastin, How can I make this shit look clean 
 Y'all really want to know who the man behind the fat sack well lookie here 
 Sho nuf ain't bootsee boss and that's for sure 
 'Cause bootsee be frontin himself off y'all niggas just don't know 
 The ones you least expect you know them square ass niggas in your city 
 They be the ones who have a grip, they be the ones who be sittin' pretty 
 Instead of tryin' to be super to start a fuckin' track man 
 What a nigga really need to do is sit back and straight stack man 
 'Cause I've been on this Earth for 3 and some odd months man 
 Trippin' off how these niggas out here be straight transforming 
 Laughing and smiling, loving and hugging a brother grinning 
 Turn around and talk behind your back the next minute 
 Bitch we call him bootsee
