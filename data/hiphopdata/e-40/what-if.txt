If god had long hair, and a gottie, 
 And if his eyes were pretty glazed, 
 And he looked spaced out would you buy hhis story, 
 Would yo believe he had an eye infection? 
 And yeah, yeah, god looks baked 
 And yeah, yeah, god smells good 
 And yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 What is god smoked ?, 
 Hit the bong like some of us, 
 Drove a tydie microbus, and listens to rolling stones, 
 If god a place in the beging and did he grow any seeds, 
 Or did he put them there for adam and eve, 
 So theyed be hungry for the apple that the snake was offerin 
 And yeah yeah god rolls great, 
 And yeah yeah god smells good, 
 And yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, 
 What if god smoked ?, 
 Do you suppose he had a bus? 
 When he made the platipus, 
 He made it earth our home. 
 Does he like perljam or the stones? 
 And do you think he rolls his own, 
 Up there in heavin on the throne? 
 And when the saints go marching home, 
 Maybe he sits and smokes a bong.
