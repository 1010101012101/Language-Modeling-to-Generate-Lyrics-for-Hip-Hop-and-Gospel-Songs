I'm on like a pot/ I cook up 
 I got the hook up 
 A slap makes the demons look up 
 I got em' shook up 
 ... 
 Yayo college is what I took up 
 Northern cali fo ya my nizzle 
 Put up or shut up 
 Homeboy loaded like a shot gun 
 Smokin' like a chimney 
 Higher 
 Than the trees in Yosemite 
 Twisted like a pretzel 
 Drinkin' cranberry and cognac 
 Stay afloat keep my head above sea level 
 So much hate in my region 
 So much stress in my brain 
 Hey a rapper ain't eatin' 
 So he needs someone to blame 
 So they blame it on ya boy 
 'Cause I got the biggest mouth 
 Light it up and have a chain 
 See the soul train 
 Step your bar game up 
 Practice your penmanship 
 Stop the claiming and making excuses 
 Nigga make a hit 
 Just the other day I heard a fuck nigga say 
 Funny y'all with him but Vallejo ain't in the bay 
 I said that's some hard shit a nigga like you would say 
 Cause' it's haters like your washed up ass that's in the way 
 Ugh.
