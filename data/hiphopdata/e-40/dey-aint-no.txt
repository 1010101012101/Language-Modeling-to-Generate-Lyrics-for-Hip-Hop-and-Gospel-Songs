Zapp IV beneath the ashtray, woofers in the back 
 Water in the duals make loud glass pack 
 Gold tippytoes without a lick of chrome 
 Bought a set of vogues and left the, stickers on 
 Seven grand worth a buck for the trunks 
 Paid cash, all ones 
 Some old bitch came up to me and said, "What's the latest bro?"

 Sold a bunch of units underground 
 They was bumpin Save a Hoe in every town 
 Rumor has it that I died I got smoked main 
 But I'm alive, they was talkin' about somebody else main
