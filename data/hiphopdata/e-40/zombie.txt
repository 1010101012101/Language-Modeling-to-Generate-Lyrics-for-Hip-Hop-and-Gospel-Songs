If you're a zombie 
 If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul, or fiend [x7] 
 Lynch, E-40 
 It's that season of the sickness your witnessing nigga sittin' spin 
 I'mma get you addicted when I spit shit, venomous shit, shit again 
 Shit so much I gotta go to Costco to get my toilet paper 
 Hit so much, spit so much, grip the pistol up, I'm a skitzo nut 
 Zeppo rape or keep her safe or he could take her 
 Chill pill, real deal, kill bill 
 I might be sick, but that ain't the reason that I still spit real ill 
 Niggas ain't got no lyrics when I hear it I'm like, "What's up with that?" 
 Everybody wanna copy me, so I'm choppin 'em up leave rotten meat 
 I'mma be drama free like my momma be 
 Supersize before I let a nigga ride on me, that ain't comedy 
 I don't get, I don't have to get it 
 Mini AK, I call him midget 
 And he got a sister heatin' 'em up makin' his skin blister 
 I'm a monster you're a zombie 
 I'm lookin' out the window and it's thundering and lightning 
 2 in the afternoon the sky is black and it's frightening 
 They're howling, lurking and prowling, growling 
 Back we're smiling, crowding, around my place 
 Gimme 40 feed and a house of space 
 Before I bust you in the face 
 Witch thumper, thumper 
 Pack 3 guns like a hunter, hunter 
 Kick a nigga ass like a putter, putter 
 Beat a muthafucka like a drummer, drummer 
 Base play crazy half a hate a hazy 
 Floor game like the Gracie's 
 I'm a monster, I'm a fiend on the microphone 
 Welcome into my twilight zone, play me foul get tombstoned 
 Send you da hell where you belong 
 Gonna wish ya had a muthafuckin snow cone, no coat on 
 I got the wickedest flow 
 Serve a muthafucka take out to go 
 Send a hubba head to a sucka front door 
 Lynch and 40 water Nina in this ho 
 If you're a zombie, monster, ghoul or fiend 
 If you're a zombie see your lovin' every way Tech, Lynch and 40 sing 
 See ya gotta be conscious of what it means 
 Then I know that your ready for what it brings 
 Do you know what I mean when I say Caribou Lou 
 Then your tellin' me Tech Nina go ahead and do you 
 Do ya never get enough of Nina and you listen when you with the crew 
 KCT you knowin' just what it do 
 Your ass probably startin' to moshpit 
 Lovin' every minute of bangin' this boss shit 
 You throwin' up your set around all cliques 
 You never wanna be hangin' with a soft bitch 
 You know who you are muthafuckas 
 If You're a zombie, monster, ghoul, or fiend [x7] 
 If You're a zombie [x7] 
 If You're a zombie, monster, ghoul, or fiend
