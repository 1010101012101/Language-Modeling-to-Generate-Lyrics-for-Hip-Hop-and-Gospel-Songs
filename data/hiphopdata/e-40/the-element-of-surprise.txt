Surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise... 
 (Surprise niggas!) 
 Biotch! 
 Surprise, the element, apply pressure 
 Surprise, the element, apply pressure 
 Surprise nigga! 
 Surprise, the element, apply pressure 
 Surprise nigga! 
 Surprise, them lies, I抦 talking about the element of surprise 
 Time to go get some getback, never sit back 
 Why should I wait on a muthafucka to come and get me 
 When a muthafucka like me can whip back 
 If so step back, tax a muthafucka hella quickly 
 With a twenty gauge, fully tellie 
 Have at his ass first, little remorse 
 St. Valentine抯 Day Massacre 
 Tryin'?to hit that patna, dude in the passenger seat 
 LeSabre, bitch played us, he hate us, bitch made us 
 It抯 heinous, he hate us, disobeyed us, hiatus 
 Underrate us, underpaid us, tried to spray us and erase us 
 And is on, wonder if it抯 good or bad karma 
 So don抰 try to figure out, try to find out, it抯 a drought 
 Maybe that抯 why everybody walking here around with they lips poked out 
 So if you rook me 
 >From enhancing growl, come and hook me 
 Buying yellow clusters instead of counterfiet dope 
 Alexander the Great, macadamia nut, chief rockin'?soap 
 No rebate, no refunds 
 Fuck 慹m and feed 慹m deacons 
 Money back guarantee my ass 
 This is the future, that was the past 
 Sqare ain抰 nothin'?慴out this game we playa style 
 Able to smoke weed but you keep on laughin'?and smilin' 
 Set your ass up executional style 
 Hit 慹m in the back of the head until they dead 
 Down on the floor spread, they layin?Liquid body clot, reekin?brains in the sky 
 Sleepin' nighty night nigga, nighty night nigga! 
 Them niggas gone from magazines 
 I ain抰 even try my 4th of July pal 
 Surprise, surprise, surprise 
 Surprise, the element, apply pressure 
 Surprise, surprise, surprise 
 Surprise, them lies, I抦 talking about the element of surprise 
 Here come a hundred of them dudes, fifth deep 
 Carryin?hero firearm, cause it抯 nice to be dry 
 Forteen and over LOG抯 and YG抯 ready to put down a homicide 
 Forty-five colt firearm, Remington sixteen gauge shot gun 
 Two of them ultra-light machine bombers, AR fifteen and Tommy guns 
 Ready to run into bumbles 
 Rushin? all I need is a shooter with a Rueger ticket 
 See the definition of the element of surprise is when a nigga least expect it 
 Retrospect it, It get抯 hectic (mind抯 hectic) 
 See he probably would have been able to prevent if he would抳e saw it comin'?But he didn抰, so he抯 in it, nigga should抳e went against the grain 
 See that抯 the perfect example of the kind of shit that can happen to a 
 Muthafucka when he owe too much to the game 
 When a sucka owe too much to the game 
 That ain抰 wise, see I got guys, somebody dies 
 Surprise, surprise, surprise 
 Surprise, the element, apply pressure 
 Surprise, surprise, surprise 
 Surprise, the element, apply pressure 
 Surprizise, you got a bullet in your bizack 
 Surprise, the element, apply pressure 
 Surprizise, you got a bullet in your bizack 
 Surprise, them lies, I抦 talking about the element of surprise 
 Sittin'?here, just we抣l let the fonk die down for a minute or two 
 Make it look like we a bunch of cuts finna beef 
 And get into it with some old other crew and hit all they spots at once 
 Do what we came to do and then get about our business with no delaying 
 Let抯 end it up and hit the freeway 
 I tell my v-lay, I bet you can抰 do the samething all over and over again 
 For something like about a weekand a half straight 
 Duplicate to instant replay, I hate haters that be hatin'?on players like me 
 And the C-L-I-C-K 
 See what a sucka don抰 know is what a sucka can抰 see 
 And what a sucka can抰 see is what a sucka don抰 know 
 Finger on the chrome 
 Ridin'?crusty with my war face on 
 Out the window yellin'?die bitch die, die bitch die, die bitch die... 
 (Chorus and die bitch die continuing) 
 (Ad-libs until the end)
