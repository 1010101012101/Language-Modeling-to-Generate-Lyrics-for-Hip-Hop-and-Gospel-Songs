Kick this shit about the mail man 
 Time for the payback, backpay 
 Can't let homie live to see his birthday 
 A.K., Forty's lettin hot ones to the kidney 
 Bootsee muthafucka didn't know what hit him 
 What way, rode up on his ass in a Chevy 
 Baby, nigga shoulda known that shit was heavy 
 Domain, shouldn't a fuck up all my fuckin' fetti 
 That I gave him, spent my shit with a nigga from another city 
 Then they doubled, tripled and sold his ass some swivle 
 Little old sucker-butt nigga trust the mail man 
 Now his ass is trash like a garbage can 
 Caught up in some shit with the mailman
