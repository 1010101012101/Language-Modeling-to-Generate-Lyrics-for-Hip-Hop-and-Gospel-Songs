 Every night and day, I've been waiting for you to call 
 Alwayz ask mah friends if I really need you at all... at all

 Wit meeh and we could be so happy... 
 You can't see meeh, I'm an undercover mack 
 Waiting for mah gurl to call 
 I'm gonna break you off 
 You can't see me 
 You can't see what I can see
