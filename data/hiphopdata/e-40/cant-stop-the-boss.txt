Jazze Pha: 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 You are now tuned in to the very best 
 Of the Phin-vale Anton-tindale 
 (Chorus:Jazze Pha) 
 You can't stop the boss - like a runaway train 
 You can not stop me (stop me) 
 I'm on go and still in the game 
 You can not stop me - you can't stop the boss 
 This ain't no red light district 
 Green lights I fly by 
 She say we look like pimpin' 
 I say baby you know you can't stop the boss
