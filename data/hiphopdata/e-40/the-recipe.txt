Hey, this is cooking with Brooke 
 On the Cooking Channel 
 Today we're gonna be making crack 
 First take 36 ounces of coke 
 Mixing it with water in a pot on the stove 
 Next step to make them boulders add baking soda 
 If the flame is low then turn it up and stir it up 
 Finally, just wait till it gets hard 
 Then bag it up, you got a key 
 Homie, that's the recipe, that's the recipe 
 That's the recipe 
 (E40) 
 Before you decide to elect yourself in the game of dope 
 Better know that it is cut throat 
 Can't be cracking under pressure when your backed in a corner 
 Against the ropes 
 They ain't calling it snitching no more 
 They calling it telling the truth 
 They say you better get down first 
 Before they decide to get down on you 
 Mixing it up, Shake and bake 
 Its 2008, they got more data than '88 
 We used to make crazy cake, flipping weight 
 Got get in and out before it be too late 
 I don't want to be 6 feet under 
 So I pack and tote my thunder 
 Suckas want to hate and block my thunder 
 'Cause I got more kicks than a punter 
 Murder rates go up in the summer 
 Killers go hunting like a hunter 
 (How good can you live?) 
 You can live good for 6 years 
 Then it's football numbers 
 Gucci mane 
 Chef for the year, better yet, the fucking century 
 Dread head killers with me before dem up insolate 
 Scccrrrrrr! 
 I'm in the kitchen scrapping up the pottery 
 Working with my hands like the maestro at the symphony 
 Sniff, I'm cocaine shawty, take a whiff of me 
 Sniff a liffy pisso nigga come and comprehend from me 
 Talk slick to me, E40 style, you hearing me? 
 Got a green skirt and I bought it off a recipe 
 Hella p's, hella keys, yellow, purple, red, green 
 Put me in the feds if these crackers on the recipe 
 33 yellow D's purchased off my recipe 
 Heavy coca in the G, plus I got a recipe 
 BUN B 
 Well it's Chef Boy A-Bun B, the king of the kitchen 
 I got exactly what you need to do your thing when your pitching 
 Guarantee to add a few layers of bling on your stitching 
 Big tittied in they chest get ta stinging and itching 
 Got to have the right ingredients before you can start 
 Like 1 part gangsterism and 1 part heart 
 2 parts of keeping it G then add to 100 
 Milligrams of a killer man and you then done it 
 Put it all inside a Cadillac on 3's and them 4's 
 Swang wide and mix scurrily while skating on vogues 
 Don't forget to shake them haters off homie that's a necessity 
 Now you done made you a trill, nigga 
 That's the recipe
