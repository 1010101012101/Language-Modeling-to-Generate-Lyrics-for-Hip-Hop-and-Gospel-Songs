(E-40) 
 Yeah E-40 and the muthafuckin c-l-i-c-k in this muthafucka, you know 
 I got my cousin Kaveo on the muthafuckin side of me 
 We fin to spit some of this old flamboyant shit, check game- 
 It's another one of them drought spots, a ha-bin cost is like fuck it 
 Niggaz taken loses that they can't make up 
 Gettin' gaffled for some of that shit call cake-up 
 Strechin the crap, making a bad batch 
 The screen from a trweekers pipe turns black 
 So they go crazy, get hot-headed, start actin' a fool yellin' 
 But y'all know there ain't no refunds in the shit that I'm sellin 
 'Cause during the drought season niggaz be lookin' for a reason to rush ya 
 So I suggest you put up your bootsees man and pull out your buckets 
 (Kaveo) 
 Here's another part of this shit that a niggaz up lift about the game 
 The drought season main, 'cause this shit here never remains the same 
 And a brother ain't about to let his muthafuckin capital go mein 
 So instead he gots to get scandlous 
 'Cause he can't keep up and handle hisbuisness 
 Like he use to and he ain't really wit being through, get to it dude 
 Gotta pull a straight come-up, lick 
 Catchin' muthafuckas outta bounds swerv, 
 Breakin they punk ass leavin' scared 
 'Cause this is the type of shit that occur 
 So don't get caught loose on perv 
 (40) 
 I gots meals, wheels, and about 5 thousand dollars worth of bills 
 Bank account way on the red, fuckin' with the highest overhead 
 Jackin off my money yo ass is out boy and I promise you that 
 I'm a money hungry muthafucka and I'm so serious about my scratch 
 So you're best bet is 
 To check yourself before you wreck yourself punk botch 
 I gets down and dirty like Dr. Ruth and I put that on the Gooch 
 Droppin' muthafuckas just like a bad habit, Dag nab it 
 Tricks wanna get outta line I let 'em have it 
 Now bag it, I gots Ice Cream Candy 
 And all kinds of things of that flavor 
 And maybe later I might be willing to go low as long as you buyer before 
 'Cause I'm the only muthafucka with A-1 Yola, 
 None of that ol caken with baking soda 
 It gets released, ceased, and then the prices rises like yeast 
 Those who gots leftovers will become obese, 
 Triplin' my mail off the triple beam scale 
 I even got enemies with envy askin' me for yayo
