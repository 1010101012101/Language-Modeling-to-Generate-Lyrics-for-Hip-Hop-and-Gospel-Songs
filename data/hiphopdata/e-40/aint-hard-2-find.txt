They say 
 Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin 
 Where I can pile up my chips 
 And n****s call me a timer 
 I been ballin' since my adolecsent years steady climbin 
 Man, you motherfuckers don't know nothin' about no timin 
 That's right, that's right boy start that s*** off 
 I heard a rumor I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized 
 Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried 
 But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted 
 Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin' 
 Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find 
 Why I spend most of my time on California crime 
 Watching for thievin' I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin 
 Puttin' a bullet in motherfuckers give me a reason 
 See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded 
 You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment 
 I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead 
 Why the f*** you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G 
 For the life of me, I cannot see 
 How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of f***in' around with me 
 And if you don't like this rhyme 
 Then bring your big bad ass to California, 'cause we ain't hard to find 
 Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin' 
 Where I can pile up my chips 
 And n****s call me a timer 
 I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin' 
 Man, you motherfuckers don't know nothin' about no timin' 
 I got my locs on hard hat goin' to war 
 Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights 
 Watch 'em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers 
 And get to dumpin' on they a**, like the last outlaws 
 Rich, Tupac and the Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips 
 With enough s*** to raise your block in one dip 
 We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt 
 And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick 
 I'm fully automatic full of static and s*** 
 Movin' Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip 
 I'm ridin' shot gun with the tint in the back 
 I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin' mint in this rap 
 I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O 
 Where sellin' narcotics is all I know 
 I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind 
 And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find 
 Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin' 
 That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right) 
 To the point where a n**** can't stop 
 Too much feelin' this s***, that's why I'm quick to peel a b**** 
 Whether it's a n**** or a hoe, a hoe 
 Get in my way, then that ass gots to go 
 'Cause a n**** steady plottin' 
 I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin' 
 Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin' 
 Where I can pile up my chips 
 And n****s call me a timer 
 I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin' 
 Man, you motherfuckers don't know nothin' about no timin' 
 C-Bo and D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich 
 Da Bay, beitch! 
 Down the steps 
 Abandoned broken down apartment complex 
 Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary 
 Playboy, what the f*** is the proof without the drama play 
 N****, what the f*** you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate 
 Best shake and bake although mine was first to ask n****s 
 Motherfuckers didn't think I wasn't going do somethin', ask n****s 
 Threaten your life, ain't like you love him 
 Bury your thoughts, take his head f*** him have at him 
 Check this out 
 I grew up with that n****, threw up with that n**** 
 I hear he tryin' to ride, double-edgin' for the other side 
 But now, my glock be so judgmental 
 Back seat of a rental keep my name out your dental 
 N****, if your gum bleedin', and you needin' 
 Mo' than twenty stitches, you behaved like dem b****es 
 Sideways to the race 
 Heavy in the game, check the resident it's all the same 
 N****, and we ain't hard to find 
 Hell nah we ain't hard to find 
 The whole clickilation fool 
 Motherfuckers hard to find, right here b**** 
 Why them n****s actin' like they can't find us 
 Like like they can't see us and 
 Like we don't be at the same spots they be at 
 It's the same congregation, Young Pac is back 
 You know what I mean? 
 N**** be lookin' all the way when he see you and s*** 
 It's a celebration, Young Pac is back 
 Motherfuckers better understand this s*** 
 Ay D-Shot n**** can we get paid man? 
 Can we just go there and sock this s*** up? 
 Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to fine 
 Drinkin' and s***, f***in' with some hurricane 
 A motherfucker's gonna get his Marlboro's regardless playa 
 You supposed to 
 Sideways to the next light
