(E-40) 
 Uh, you in a new school whip custom painted candy apricot butter 
 I'm in an antique oldschool four door muffler draggin' beat up duster 
 Wit scrapes and scratches, nicks and scars 
 Y'all git to drink out of wine glasses, we gotta drink out of jelly jars 
 Down and out like four flat tires no washing machine nor dryer 
 Just ah pillow sack 
 And ah bunch of clothes wrapped in a sheet on our way to the laundrymat 
 Will I ever get paid, can I make a dollar out of fifteen cent 
 Y'allz got it made, we broke and starvin' barely payin' the rent 
 Sleepless nights, alligator tears 
 Mommy arguin' wit my daddy, daddy drunk too many beers 
 911 Mr.Po, Po dey ain't happy wit day marriage 
 Pops tryn'a beat her down and make her have a miscarriage 
 My cousin shoots the needle, she be gone for days 
 She on that da ah diesel, she gone end up wit aids 
 I told her I love her but you know what she said to me 
 Everybody got a gay or atleast one dope fiend in they family 
 You ain't the only one wit a reject in yo family 
 That's real
