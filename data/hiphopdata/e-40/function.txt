Re-Chorus: 
 Hey, hey bitch, try this! 
 Guarantee turn a square to a bop bitch 
 You ain't down, bye bitch 
 I ain't got time for playin', I'm just saying man 
 We out here tryna function, we out here tryna function 
 We out here tryna function, we out here tryna function 
 I ain't got time for playin', I'm just saying man 
 We out here tryna function 
 We out here tryna function, bitch 
 You're fucking off my high, get up out my mix 
 You're messing up my vibe, I'm trying to get some crevis 
 Put'em in my ride, take her to the Ritz 
 I'm tossing this sloppy, offa my broccoli, Bacardi 
 One fifty one out my body, I'm about that green like wasabi 
 Like Young Bari we mobbin', we bouncin', back the fuck off me 
 Getting money my hobby, not getting money is nothing 
 The rappers I listen to is E-40 and Pac 
 I'm having my revenue playa having this guap 
 I'm on my fly big nigga shit I'm stayin laced and groomed 
 I spray myself with sucka repellent my nigga, not perfume 
 You think you God, I can sell it a hustler think I can't 
 Gifted gab, paint the White House, black paint 
 Word candy SLANG 
 I'm thinkin' bout takin' a million dollar insurance policy out on my mouthpiece 
 Hey, hey bitch, try this! 
 Guarantee turn a square to a bop bitch 
 You ain't down, bye bitch 
 I ain't got time for playin', I'm just saying man 
 We out here tryna function, we out here tryna function 
 We out here tryna function, we out here tryna function 
 I ain't got time for playin', I'm just saying man 
 We out here tryna function 
 Hey bitch, OK bitch 
 It's uncle Earl and the HBK bitch 
 Mention the gang they already know that we ballin 
 I'm coming straight out the Rich 
 I got family down in New Orleans 
 Where you from, you say you're lying 
 Out here we say that you jawsin 
 You probably thought this never would happen my niggas been called that 
 Alcoholic, sippin on that liquor, oh I'm drunk as hell 
 Fuckin' witta a lil bitch over in Vallejo 
 Got a whole pack of pre-rolled Young L's 
 And I'm never down to uno, pockets on sumo 
 Haters respect the pedigree, ballin heavily 
 A phony homie, I never be for methamphetamine 
 That means its crack hoe, young G, hotter than Tabasco 
 I smash hoes, collect two hunnid and pass GO 
 My flow so Lamborghini, yo shit's so Rav 4 
 Now you understand why everything I do I gas hoe, Suzy, nigga 
 Hey, hey bitch, try this! 
 Guarantee turn a square to a bop bitch 
 You ain't down, bye bitch 
 I ain't got time for playin', I'm just saying man 
 We out here tryna function, we out here tryna function 
 We out here tryna function, we out here tryna function 
 I ain't got time for playin', I'm just saying man 
 We out here tryna function 
 I'm out here tryna function, out here tryna function 
 Don't talk to me bitch if we ain't buckin 
 Yeah I'm a asshole, I don't give a fuck though 
 Skip the bullshit, like wassup, what's wassup though? 
 Tight girl too much, make ya bitch choose up 
 Niggas gettin' mad, nigga what you gon do? 
 If he think he too tough, you know I keep two tucked 
 If I don't fight that mean I'm gomin back to shoot 
 Ridin' in the car, lookin' for a bad bitch 
 With some ass and tits, yeah she gotta be dumb cute 
 Got her number, text her phone, like "Baby what you doin'?" 
 She was like, "None much, you should come through" 
 I got dick for days, I got dick for days 
 Made her take off from work, and gave her dick for days 
 Push it to my brain, to my temple bitch 
 And I don't like these hoes, I give'em dick and dip 
 Hey, hey bitch, try this! 
 Guarantee turn a square to a bop bitch 
 You ain't down, bye bitch 
 I ain't got time for playin', I'm just saying man 
 We out here tryna function, we out here tryna function 
 We out here tryna function, we out here tryna function 
 I ain't got time for playin', I'm just saying man 
 We out here tryna function
