That candy paint, that candy paint, 84's 
 That candy paint, that candy paint, 84's, built in ? chrome grille, leather seats, ?, TV screens and wooded wheels (x4) 
 E-40: 
 That candy paint, smoking that dank, beats so loud bystanders faint 
 Neighborhood watch call and complain, 
 Hate on my big fat ass bank 
 Po-po pull me over say you a rap singer 
 I know you smoke weed, let me smell your finger 
 Linger, that the green thumb jars got a valid registration and my cannibus card 
 I'm challenged, got candy paint on my harley, harley 
 ?.And truck, jet ski's boats and old school cut' (cutlass) 
 Looking for a top shelf not know? 
 That candy paint, gotta go can't believe their eyes 
 Drank and drank, flabbergasted mesmerize 
 Digital dash, havin' my cash 
 Secret stash for my strap 
 Gotta shake these suckers and watch my back 
 I'm slapping so hard my windshield cracked, windshield cracked? windshield cracked 
 I'm slapping so hard my windshield cracked 
 My old bitch joalous, put my tires on a? 
 Slim Thug: 
 Gon' show them boyz how we rollin' mane, 
 I'm addicted to this flossin' that why all my rides so awesome 
 I keep that big 'lac bossin it don't matter what it's costing 
 Tossing deuces out the roof, but that coupe 
 While I ride by, players chunking deuces back 
 Bobs holl'in out "hi" 
 Feel like I'm up in the sky, yo all know that bay green 
 40 got them going ? when we pull up on the scene 
 Candy paint, looking clean, fo's looking king size 
 Heads turn while I drive it's like they can't believe their eyes 
 It's that that boy thugger and that bad motherfucker 
 Swanging banging riding dirty screwed and chopped on them suckers 
 Flipping flipping looking good, diamonds diamonds 'gainst the wood 
 From the Texas to the Cali, catch me tipping through the hood 
 Bun B of UGK: 
 It's Houston Texas that's the city where we ride the greatest 
 Gripping grain, drippin' stain, turning up, rober davis 
 That old school great tape, a trunk poppa plate scrapa 
 Hustler and a grinder every day I'm trying to make paper 
 I'm from pa represent for UGK and I'm riding for my city like it's rapper? 
 I got homies on the west I got homies in detroit 
 Matter of fact these gladiators are all over, all day 
 Sittin' in that candy paint sideways, 
 Pull up outta my driveway 
 Drop that top and let them jock, then head on out on that highway 
 Turn up some rig shot, or maybe swisher house 
 Now pass the kush and dump the swisha out it's going down 
 Chorus till end
