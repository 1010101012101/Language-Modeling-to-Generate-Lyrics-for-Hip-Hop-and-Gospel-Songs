Talking:'Cause I'm tellin' you man they ain't nothing else to talk about 
 The same shit every motherfuckin album, I don't give a damn how many he put 
 Out he talk about the same shit from goddamn T.R.U. 
 You got D's, candy paint, wood grain with the leather seats 
 Mercedes, baby, lady, baby, crazy, merecdes 
 I done heard that shit 2pac wannabe ass nigga (mocking P) "I ain't no rapper 
 I write short films" 
 O.k. grab your popcorn ain't no more sunshine. 
 Come on, O.K., peep it my techs swing low like sweet chariots 
 Bust 'em and burry em 
 That be his faithness sending flowers to they wait 
 And crying at they wake 
 And mourning with these motherfuckaz mothers 
 Fotr plottin out a way to kill they brother 
 Another nigga bled another niggaz gone be bleeding 
 'Cause I ain't trynna hear that shit this evening 
 Y'all niggaz best believe in 
 Guerilla warfare 
 Lets creep across the cemetery how they get there 
 I tell ya was this nigga from Lake Olmstead 
 My nigga said that he been fucking up dope since day one so instead 
 Of pumpin the shit in Olmstead 
 I suggest he take that stupid shit to Sunset 
 But naw, but naw he wanna play bad Billy bad ass and shit 
 I'm flawing my game like I can't perform the hit 
 I threw on the fucking plastic bag 
 Wrapped my hands around his ass the squeezed 
 Till the nigga can't breath 
 Limiting cheese about my trap, how the fuck imma catch the mouse 
 If you busting ya gun and steady runnin' ya mouth 
 But down south I ain't no hard ass nigga 
 But best believe real come the thriller 
 Motherfucka I feel ya 
 Blast them hollow points, 'cause hollow points get points across 
 They want the juice but they don't want to pay the cost 
 Now who's the boss 
 My nigga ask these hoes 
 I'm nuttin in they mouth and they nose 
 They eyes if they ain't closed 
 The lifestyle that I chose who knows may make me rich 
 But if them feds kick down them doors then lifes a bitch 
 I'm sittin' in the patty wagon thinking 'bout the snitch 
 And wit my phone call I know exactly who to hit 
 My niggaz Don Perry we got some bodies to burry 
 Hide them niggaz with rugers and hide them lugers with Karen 
 Now its very nescesary that this bid go through 
 'Cause I already know my niggaz threw 
 Ain't no motherfuckin sunshine 
 Chorus:Ain't no motherfuckin sunshine, Its only tech nines and clips and 
 Niggaz that equip for whatever 
 I thought you knew better, but you still ran your mouth now you runnin' from 
 Them fuckin' Georgia Boys from down south <repeat> 
 Ain't no sunshine my nigga, the sun ain't gonna shine 
 Till I reach about a million 
 Talkin' billions with Brazilions 
 I got this funny feeling that I'm gone be filthy rich 
 And I'm gone marry money 'cause money's a faithful bitch 
 If it ain't one thang its ten more so fuck another 
 Surrounded by undercovers every time they see they sucker 
 My mind be in the gutter, but that's how I burn the house 
 Because I try to prove what these pussy niggaz bout 
 These niggaz make me shout, yeah they frustrate me 
 Because I sell dope I guess that's why these niggaz hate me 
 Make me recall, think it was the fall of 96 
 But time don't matter nigga doing the same shit 
 The Narcs about to hit 
 His habit made 'em tell 
 Officer and the law, bastard crooked as hell 
 They lookin' for Terrel 
 Mixed him up with Derrel it's 2 Derrels 
 They hit they doe with Marquel 
 Breakin 'em on the phone, told my niggaz time to bail 
 They knew we shot them niggaz they just lookin' for the shells 
 They try to best they nail, like nail give me a break 
 Us cooley high niggaz, us niggaz is hard to take 
 We, appreciate they bust 
 We, appreciate they threat 
 We, appreciate that we so smooth they ain't caught us yet 
 Now Karen want respect, claim I'm doing her wrong 
 But my name is not Rome, I don't know where I belong 
 Pumpin her up with these songs, so so-long to all three 
 Get O.U.T. but first let me get my thangs 
 The ho had bring me box with the lock that she was holdin' 
 She brought my shit downstairs, my fuckin' box was open 
 I'm holdin' my breath before I mothafuckin hurt her 
 Rambaling through my shit no shells from the murder 
 I asked her calmly where the fuck is my shit 
 "Troy that's all I had" 
 What the fuck you mean bitch 
 It should have been six empty bullets and my ruger 
 Fuck trynna explain popped her, had to shoot her 
 I knew that the murders would interfer with my grindin 
 But what the fuck you expect if the sun ain't shinin 
 My mind is fucked up {why} I keep on picturing Karens head jerking 
 Disturbing me while I'm working 
 This clouds lurking over me, like a cartoon 
 Too hot in the streets I got to stay in my room 
 Soon to be charged 3 murders second count 
 But once in this will, twinzo I leave her out 
 Yo burn for your nigga, 'bout the dope visit my brother 
 Its back to Atlanta, shit too hot in Augusta and I knew I shouldn't trust her 
 'Cause I keep thinking 'bout her ass 
 Bout 2 or 3 knocks at my door and who is that 
 Just that fast, niggaz done ran up in my shit 
 Ski mask and guns and they, shooting to hit 
 I ran up stairs to get my gat yeah that mack 
 I'm running and ducking one grazed me cross my back 
 But then I reach my gat, payback I'm bustin' rockets 
 Ran back to the stairs took two clips off in my pocket 
 His gun I heard him cock it went the bustin' over there 
 I'm poppin' on them pussy niggaz, die nigga yeah 
 I pop one in his ear, told him I would fear nothin' 
 Snatched a mack up off the nigga, and is there Karen's cousin 
 Then I rushed into the bathroom then turned off the light 
 I heard somebody footsteps approaching to my right 
 Now bullets taking flight.I'm bustin' in all directions 
 I laid in the tub praying for my protection 
 Done hit me to perfection I was fucked up in the game 
 While laying in the tub I heard them niggaz call my name 
 My 6'3 frame to be filled with bullet holes 
 If I gotta leave some more of them has got to go 
 I ran back to the stairs and went the bustin' with mine 
 All directs wit tech 9 
 But they waitin in line, I was fine shit went to the phone to call Greg 
 Boom, Boom done took two to the head 
 It ain't no fuckin' sunshine!
