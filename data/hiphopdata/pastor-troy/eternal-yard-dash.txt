Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha HA Ha Ha Ha 
 Come on 'cause, we almost there 
 We almost there 'cause 
 Goddamn, where the finish line? 
 (What) (11x) 
 Fuck this shit, I need some cheese 
 And I need it quicker than nestle 
 If I have to kill then God bless me 
 All these pussy motherfuckers, they shouldn't have test me 
 Left me looking like the villain, I was thinking of ending 
 Nobody knew what I was going through 
 All these motherfuckers saying what they gonna do 
 But then again all these motherfuckers ain't true 
 So who am I gonna trust, am I going on and bust 
 Myself nigga, damn this shit 
 Fuck riding round' nigga, fuck being rich 
 I can't take it, the shit to thick 
 And it ain't my fault 
 So I ought to give the motherfucker telling lies to me 
 Hey the say, what it's gonna be, but empty pockets all I goddamn see 
 D-E-F, no one's left, then again, shit no one's right 
 I'm a kill my damn self the night 
 I get fear, it ain't my fault he couldn't fight 
 It ain't like, when I motherfucking die, this whole world gonna fall apart 
 But it's a race, and I got a bad heart 
 Breath in the mouth, and I got a head start 
 I'm running for nothing, I'm running for nothing (7x) 
 So I'm gonna kill myself 
 A motherfucker tellin' me what he gonna do 
 When I knew the motherfucker wouldn't do shit 
 A nigga tease you, then a nigga leave you 
 'Cause he heard that the shit done got thick, punk bitch 
 I'm in the mood for cocaine 
 The only thing I see when a nigga look 
 Come and get the baking soda, let me split the powder open 
 Then I got this dope when the shit cook 
 What it took for me to really understand if it really don't matter 
 What the fuck you been through 
 If a motherfucker see you doin' better, my nigga I'm here to tell ya' 
 Motherfuckers gonna hate you 
 Not a clue, If I really wanna new motherfucking 22. 
 Two years was that far away 
 I never would have had a chance and would have killed Pastor Troy on yesterday 
 This heaven, where the streets of gold, and why the hell is the a/c off 
 Where the fuck, all the loved ones that I lost 
 Fuck this shit, take me to the boss 
 Do you understand the cost, ever paid 
 In order for me to be here tonight 
 Nigga what's up, something ain't right 
 Tell the Lord to turn on the damn light 
 Feeling like an angel when I take flight 
 Shit, as I try I'm on the damn mic 
 All my pounds tune out my damn sight 
 Look, why the fuck I was packed so tight 
 Nigga I ain't Mike I'm Micah 
 Think I'm in the wrong spot 
 Not only do I have on black, it's too hot 
 But why my K motherfucker ain't shot 
 I got those halos, hello, motherfucker shit nigga, I'm talking to you 
 Slap the clip in the tech 22. 
 Let the shit fly going straight through 
 Now I got a clue, where the fuck I'm at 
 Shawty want the tech and a nigga want the bud 
 Nigga just bleedin', motherfucker out of blood 
 Looking at me smilin', asking me what 
 I got cuts, but cuts got down 
 Everyday shit I can't tell 
 Went from dwellin' in hell on earth, now I'm living inhaling hell
