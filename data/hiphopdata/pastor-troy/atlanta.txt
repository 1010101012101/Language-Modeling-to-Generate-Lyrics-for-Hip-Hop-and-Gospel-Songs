I'll always rep for you, Atlanta 
 Yeah, yeah we crankin' this for all tha G's on the east side 
 We doin' this for all the Gangstas on the west side 
 We doin' this for all the kings on the south side 
 Yo, and it's on A-T-L and it's on 
 A-T-L, A-T-L it's on, and it's on ATL it's on, and it's on, it's on 
 As I look at the road from the window 
 Reminesing on the places that I been yo 
 On the road doin' shows fuckin' thugged out 
 Crank tha club up get a playa drug out 
 I miss the crib though, on the road pleasin' my fans 
 From city to city sometimes it's hard man 
 My girl understand, but I be trippin' though 
 She tellin' me she love me more than I will ever know 
 I miss tha crib yo, I'm in the streets 
 Doin' shows four nights out tha week 
 Yeah, sometimes the king just miss his own throne 
 Pastor Troy and I miss home, A-T-L 
 Atlanta, I'll rep for you, I'll always will rep for you {*2X*} 
 I done seen more hotels than my house 
 I done seen my home boys running my spouse 
 I know it sound crazy but baby understand 
 Every night I'm out at least ten grand 
 So we can rock Louis Vuitton and have fun 
 While puttin' up a college fund for my son 
 And when we sip we sip Dom Perignon 
 And when we dip it's a nasty martin 
 I know sometime it seemslike I am just in it for the cheese 
 And every time you wanna chill it's like I up and gotta leave 
 But baby I am your king and the crib is my throne 
 I can't wait till I get back home, to A-T-L
