 (Pastor Troy Talking) 
 Ayo this ya boy Pastor Troy checkin' in right, yuh 
 (This from the soul) 
 Ayo, on this joint right here man we bout to just break it down to you 
 Man just the transition to becoming... a man (This from the heart) 
 That some of y'all gone have to go through man everybody on the sound 
 Of my voice (This from the soul) 
 Everything gone be cool man, From Boys to Men 
 [Verse 1] Pastor Troy 
 No one to doubt me, I'm not here lonely 
 Childhood secrets still wid my homies 
 I recall days when I blazed up on the hill 
 Not knowin' wud the future would hold, just kept it real 
 We ridin' on the 'Lac with the boys to other schools 
 We catch 'em at dey football games and act a fool 
 And everybody know my name, it's Michael Troy 
 We made all them bullies respect Falcon Boy 
 I got my folks worried, I'm suspended everyday 
 Sometimes I ain't tell 'em and caught the train to the A 
 The FirePoint Station, Supreme location 
 I'm only 15, tho at the lil' scene 
 No one to pry me, I'm all alone 
 No one to cry on 
 He'd shelter from the rain... to ease the pain 
 Changing from boys to men 
 I've done seen stabbings, I've done seen shootings 
 I've done seen a robbery, I've done seen two 
 But I ain't even 15, so when I turn 16 
 I'm'ma get dat chrome thing wid da beam 
 My team was da wreckin' crew, like juice 
 The type of niggas on our side do, who was the truth 
 I bet them killaz on his side respect game 
 That other nigga from the southside, was lame 
 My name is Stone, Charlestown to the bone 
 Lil' Wayne and Scooby, we rocking MCM and Gucci 
 I'm nine years old, that nigga let me touch a Uzi 
 I wanted to kill, just like I saw up in the movie 
 No wonder one of my friend shot himself in his head 
 Playin' wid the gun from under his mothers bed 
 Don't wanna call his name too tough, we'll call him Fred 
 We watch my nigga while he bled (when we was young) 
 [Verse 3] Eight-ball 
 Lord knows we be tryin' hard, God watching over us 
 Mama told me "baby dun be goin' to school cuttin' up" 
 Did I listen, hell naw, listen let me tell y'all 
 Streets transform mamas only into eight-ball 
 Errywhere I go, niggaz know I speak that poetry 
 See my +Chilouette+ like I'm +Alfred Hitchcock+ and they know it's me 
 Bottom line met a lot of niggaz on the grind 
 Getting them dimes 
 Murder they ass, escape the scene like I committed the crime 
 A friend of mine, don't rap he doing illegal business 
 18-Wheeler, Fed, X, bricks, did wid killaz 
 He smoke and dipped'em drunk with Crys and get to beating his bitches 
 Them bitches down though, come straight back after they get through strippen 
 I'm outta' town, next to the church see his lil' brotha cryin 
 Told me his brotha killed himself, I said nigga you lyin' 
 He put the gun to his mouth and blew his brain out 
 He couldn't handle this goddamn shit that we sang 'bout
