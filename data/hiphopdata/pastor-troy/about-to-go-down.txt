Its bout to go down [16X]

 Ice ya wrist baby 
 Rock ya ear 
 Put ya mink on 
 Get ya drink on

 Pop tha cris baby

 Its bout to go down [16X]

 Fuck them down south georgia boys 
 Get ya home girl they can ride too 
 If you goin' wit me its goin' down boo

 Anotha year 
 To rep my hood

 Go buy a whip 
 Take a month man 
 Take a trip

 Wit two white hoes 
 I'm bout to chill 
 So it was real 
 Later boss 
 Don't hit tha cell phone 
 Its turned off 
 Its goin' down!
