Pastor Troy: 
 Dear Pac I know you don't know me but its yo boi Pastor Troy 
 Georgia Boi 
 I'm written you today 'cause I'm sick of dis 
 Dis mutherfuckin rap game wit dat bullshit 
 I mean these muthafuckin niggas bout these hoes 
 Tend to trust on any other two songs 
 They talk about chrome 
 These niggas wont kill shit and wont let shit die 
 But they thugs in da public eye 
 Why I 
 Continue to tote pumps but minus da picture takin' 
 As soon as dem hoes jump we handle dat situation 
 I'm tired of da fakin 
 My balls big as Alaska 
 Who wanna bless da Pastor 
 I ask ya 
 Before I muthafuckin cock my weapon 
 And watch how quick they muthafuckin ass be steppin 
 But it ain't nothin' to run for 
 Ain't gone shoot shit what you tote da gun for 
 Naw bra 
 (Gun shots) boom boom 
 Its P.t muthafucka they lookin' for me I'm at my mansion in Augusta 
 I'm slick as butter 
 Da human canon ball 
 And make no mistakes 'cause I will kill 'em all 
 I never fall 'cause I'm to busy comin' up 
 I'm pullin my benz wit my monster truck 
 I cut a few friends but my endz still meet 
 And fuck sellin out 'cause I got love in da street 
 So Pac holla if ya at da Bahamas 
 Ima come and ball witcha it'll be my honor 
 Much luv for da game dat ya gave to me 
 Pastor Troy representin D.S.G.B 
 Much luv
