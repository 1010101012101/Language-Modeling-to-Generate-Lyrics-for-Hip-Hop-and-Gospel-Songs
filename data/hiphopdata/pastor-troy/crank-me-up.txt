 Nigga, Crank this shit up LOUD NIGGA! (okay) 
 Crank Me Up, PT baby is back to get bucks 
 I don't know maybe ya never, heard of 
 Comin' in the back of the club with black gloves 
 Hard as a hammer, I am Atlanta 
 Soon as I step on the scene, its lights camera 
 Action, Cash In, Fat-ass cheques, my rolex 
 Will make ya faint, huh, ya think I ain't? 
 I hit the bank and get the grands, and just to spin tonight 
 Nuh-uh, pass me the mills mamma, I got a flight 
 Lears, listen here, private jet at the-yo (?) 
 A bad ass ho, into the clouds I Go 
 The underground putting it down for five years 
 The blood, The sweat, the motherfucking tears 
 I'm living the life of a young, drug lord 
 I'll build this heffa up if I get bored 
 Now ease up shorty, let the G slide through 
 And I don't leave, without my .32 
 Tucked in the boot (boot), Tucked in a coat (coat) 
 And when I see Chuck, it's gonna get tucked in his throat 
 And murder she wrote? But hell, I can't read 
 Stabbed a ho, kidnapped the bitch, see? 
 And now I'm on the loose, now I'm on the run 
 Fuck that shit, I'll go and get a bigger gun 
 Yeah! Motherfucker (Nigga) 
 Crank Me Up! 
 If you don't give a damn, nigga, we don't give a fuck

 You suck a cracka's dick in the office then came up 
 Get it? Never for this, damn nigga test 
 See how she be because my motherfuckin chest, Nigga 
 Yes nigga, picture me, hot caprice 
 When I dun been raised by all these G's 
 Nigga, the crooks and killers, is my motherfuckin niggas 
 Jab a pussy, with some motherfuckin scissors 
 This is a, motherfuckin, crime scene, 
 I'm dumpin on the law, my nigga, by any means 
 Crank Me Up, PT baby is back to get bucks 
 I don't know maybe ya never, heard of 
 Comin' in the back of the club with black gloves 
 Hard as a hammer, I am Atlanta 
 Soon as I step on the scene, its lights camera 
 Action, Cash In, Fat-ass cheques, my rolex 
 Will make ya faint, huh, ya think I ain't? 
 I hit the bank and get the grands, and just to spin tonight 
 Nuh-uh, pass me the mills mamma, I got a flight
