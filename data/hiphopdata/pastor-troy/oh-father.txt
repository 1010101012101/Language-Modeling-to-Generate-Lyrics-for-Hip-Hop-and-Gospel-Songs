I was that cool motherfucker 
 But living in the world of these cruel motherfuckers 
 Society they made me a fool motherfucker 
 And sixteen shots leaving the pussies taking cover 
 Huh I'm sorry mother motherfuckers just ain't like me 
 The fucking braid buy twenty one is so likely 
 A million letters from the penn is writing me 
 Fuck the system the DEA sellin all the damn yay 
 So I pray them fuckers die 
 And when they leave let them pussy motherfuckers fry 
 And make they families eternally have to cry and 
 Crucify me and label me the 'n' ride I testify I'm ready 
 Oh father come and take me I surrender I'm ready [repeat 4X] 
 Statistics said I wouldn't live to see the grey in my head 
 There is to much drama in theses streets to much he and she said 
 Wont let the feds red said they want no dust in my tomb 
 So I keep my eyes red and I stay in my room 
 I'm prayin' soon that my income cause income is halted 
 If you got then I got it but anyone can talk it 
 Now tossed so simply this is universal this shit is the real deal 
 Try to feel the commercial America tell me where is the freedom of liberty 
 This place ain't meant for me so I got a quarter key 
 And move it like ryder trucks 
 Those crackers are already stuck a path 
 For my niggaz because my niggaz ain't give a fuck 
 Bout nothin' they had to say we always going to rule the GA 
 Your games is what we can play and lucifer better pray 
 That I do not do what was planned to do yesterday 
 I sware to god in Georgia 
 Oh father come and take me I surrender I'm ready [repeat 4X] 
 This is for my folks in Cuba 
 This is for my folks in Jamaica 
 This is for my folks in Africa, we ready 
 Them crackers had me fucked up I scooped a job for a min 
 But couldn't deal with the pay I quit that shit in a day 
 Back on the grind servin' my yay nothing to say 
 But I tried I'm told there is a better way but who going to pull me inside? 
 They in they ride disappointed because I had bad luck 
 I ain't ever goin' to sell this shit my nigga I'm stuck 
 My people roll they window up and then they hit and they locked 
 Its fucked up but that's the way it is down here on the block 
 Maan everyone servin' some rocks if not some rocks some weed 
 Everybody's trapped high I can't afford the heat its kinda neat 
 How they just creep and kick the door off the hinge 
 And when theses motherfuckers leave they taking all of my friend 
 No way to win 'cause we are in for the ride of our lives 
 When I was writing this shit I had to wipe my eye 
 Cause this is chaos they after us we will never succede 
 'Cause we some ignorant niggaz but all we need is to see I guarantee 
 If we stop competition get our children off these fucking streets 
 And get some Qu'ran I'm just speaking shit who am I to tell anyone 
 I'm telling ya there ain't nothing new up under the sun 
 You got your gun well fuck ya gun 
 If you goin' run when they chase ya 
 Why don't you do some that crazy shit slap that bitch in the face 
 Now or later we going to have to stand up and fight 
 We pay the taxes in this bitch nigga use your rights 
 Now I know I ain't right but I'll be damned if I'm wrong 
 They say two wrongs don't make a right 
 But damn its making me strong and when I'm gone 
 I hope this song rang in your heart 
 My nigga ain't no better time then right now to start 
 Oh father come and take me I surrender I'm ready [echoes] 
 (Repeat 4X)
