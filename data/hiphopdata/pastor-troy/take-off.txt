Pastor Troy: 
 A sad day for da rap game I'm about to tell 'em my name (Pastor!) 
 A.k.a they call me megatron da cepracon I flip into a gun and burn one 
 Soon as I duck I go change my disguise my first pump da last thing in his eyes 
 And I ain't thinkin' 'bout no get back I got a army dat can handle dat 
 Matter-a-fact you about to be introduced duck duck duck let loose 
 His triple fat goose look like cheddar cheese 
 Mention he ain't got no cheese then I leave 
 Huffin and puffin got my blood pressure high 
 Must ain't no I will ride till I die 
 I put it all on da resume 
 To come be out da Ga (now say) 
 Chorus:I'm ready for take off take off 
 I'm ready for take off (say what) 
 I'm ready for take off take off 
 I'm ready for take off say boss 
 2x 
 They say da rap game like da dope game 
 I already had a car tell 
 Talkin' to my fam on da burned cell 
 Short wit da money we give 'em hell 
 Every shell 
 Shots rang out all you hear is da dude 
 Comin' gureilla it ain't no rules 
 You say you a killa but wont let nuttin die 
 Caught 'em given mouth to mouth to fly 
 Dats why I am ready for take off 
 Fillet menoun without da steak sauce 
 Da top of da line dats me I'm prime 
 Had da underground on lock since '99 
 While you was trying to figure out yo style yo image 
 Look what you became a mothafuckin gimmick 
 Smilen and grinnin you know who you are 
 Problem sit me meet me at da bar 
 So far its three rappers I like 
 Me, myself, and I and I'm tight 
 And you ain't gots to tell me I'm high 
 Smell the aroma as I pass by 
 V.i.p everywhere dat I go 
 Soon I as I hit da door they blaze dro 
 And if I muthafuckin die today 
 Know dat I had da balls to say
