 This for them boys that been down wit me for tha last five years 
 Before this shit was cool

 I'm representin bruh them boys ain't seein me know I got some cheese spendin G's so they envy me 
 I'm representin! 
 I'm representin this nothin' but this thug shit rep mine well for ATL 
 I'm representin I'm representin my shit ho, I'm representin I'm representin my shit ho, I'm representin I'm representin my shit ho, I'm representin a bitch you already know 
 A word to tha wise 
 Before you look me in my eyes 
 Yo ho told me that ya raps a buncha lies 
 You ride through tha hood, lookin' at tha signs 
 But you was in tha house most of tha time 
 For sayin' you grind and sayin' that you drivin' chevy's 
 No AC playboy you lookin' sweaty 
 You know me you done heard vica versa 
 Know I post up in some shit just to hurt ya 
 A hundred thousand dollar truck I paid it out cash 
 Before I left tha lot I put them feet on her ass 
 Three TV's windows tinted this is how I representin 
 A word to tha wise before you confuse the people 
 I been doin' this before yo ass was legal 
 When you was at MBK my brothers keeper 
 I was on MLK wit street sweepers 
 I know you say ain't no way he can be seen 
 This niggas not a man this niggas a machine 
 Tha owner of tha Bounce I knew I'd make a profit 
 A couple hundred grand I had that shit in my pocket 
 I know that I'm tha man I know that I am winnin' 
 And r-e-p-r-e-s entin!
