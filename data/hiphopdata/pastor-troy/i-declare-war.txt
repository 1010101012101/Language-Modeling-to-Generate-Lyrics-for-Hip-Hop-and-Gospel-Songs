And I am coming with the range 
 Not calling no names on p 
 But this them same boys they said would never reach the key 
 Met mister e. and him and me decided we could win 
 We flipped the script and we bout to be legal kingpins 
 Up in the wind 
 That message sent from old savannah 
 They down with me so I ain't got to call atlanta 
 But if I do it ain't nothing but even worse for you 
 Go call your soldiers 
 Tell them to bring the hearse for you 
 Just call me and tell peter I be the peter of the cipher 
 Down south georgia boy 
 Pastor troy pass the rifle 
 Any rival ain't no rival lest we make the rivalry 
 Having problems with my rifle 
 Y'all watch y'all enemies 
 Well cause 
 War has been declared 
 What's up 
 'Cause war has been declared 
 What's up 
 'Cause war has been declared 
 What's up 
 What y'all gone do 
 What y'all gone do 
 Chorus: and I declare war 
 <Repeat 4x> 
 For my whole number connected 
 Bout to give life to all you punks 
 Y'all talk, we pop the trunk 
 Picture me and mine drunk 
 And crunk up 'cause we mad 
 Ain't never had before we hooked 
 Time to pull a kick doe 
 Negro we wrote the hook 
 Shook the dice up 
 The price I pay 
 My navy still my bill 
 Say y'all want to go to war 
 And that's ok cause now will 
 You know we filthy 
 Because to us no love was given 
 Somebody's gone come up missing 
 Drooooom, die quickly 
 Chorus: I declare war 
 And I declare war 
 <Repeat x8>
