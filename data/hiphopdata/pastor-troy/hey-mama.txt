Yeah, y'all know what time it is 
 It's your boy detroit checking in 
 And were doing this one for all dem mothers 
 For dem gangsta boys gangsta little girls 
 Doing time in this system 
 Y'all know how it goes 
 Hey mama I'm writing you from jail 
 Some crackas got me fucked up got me in a cell 
 I know you disappointed and I apologize 
 Don't want no visitation I don't wanna see ur eyes 
 Hey mama I hope you all good 
 I guess I'm doing fine I just miss the hood 
 I got a lil time but I took it like a man 
 But it ain't the end I'll get another chance 
 You always told me about the company I kept 
 I guess I'm a victim of the hood that I reped 
 A southside gangsta facing 5 to the dope 
 Before they took me I had to let 'em know 
 Hey mama I know you probly sad 
 But holla at my siblings holla at my dad 
 Tell everybody that I'm doing just fine 
 And I'm in here 'cause my life was on the line 
 Mama niggas hate when their pockets get straight 
 They think that they can rob 
 They think that they can take 
 They think that your fake 'cause they see you on TV 
 So cry for them suckers don't ever try me 
 I had to let 'em bang (Gunshot) 
 I had to let it pop 
 I had to let it sing 
 I had to make it drop 
 And if I wouldtna shot then id probably been the victim 
 That 40 cal glock first I cocked then I hit em 
 They got 'em down here right streets sell doe 
 Ain't nothing I can change I just got with the flow 
 I'm feeling kinda low but I guess I be straight 
 Just hit the lawyer up and try to rush your court date 
 Hey mama they shipped me off to prison 
 A home cooked meal the only thing that I'm missing 
 So holla at my girl so holla at my son 
 And tell 'em I'm sorry for the wrong that he done 
 Maybe this couldve been avoided but I doubt it 
 All I can do is write another rap about it 
 And try to stay sane it's all in the game 
 Some here for killing and some here for cane 
 Some here for chilling wrong place wrong time 
 Some heres situation just like mine 
 But I have no regrets 
 It couldve been worse 
 I couldve been did if I didn't bust first 
 So mama I hope that I'm forgiven 
 I write you everyday while I'm chilling off in prison 
 I'm trying to get religion 
 I'm trying to do better 
 With all my love till I write your next letter
