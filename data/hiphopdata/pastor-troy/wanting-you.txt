Yo, yo, what's up, baby? 
 At the studio, I'm almost finished 
 Where you at? Alright, I miss you too, nigga 
 Shit, I'm with K, I'm with KC and shit 
 I'll be out there as soon as I get finished with this shit 
 Alright, love you, miss you too 
 Girl, I'm wanting you, everyday I'm missing you 
 Visions of me kissing you, goddamn, I'm missing you 
 I can't wait to cuddle up, you already know what's up 
 Soon as I jump out my truck, you was gon' get gangsta fucked 
 'Cause baby girl, I want you, close my eyes and picture you 
 Thinking 'bout some freaky shit, me and my ol' gangsta bitch 
 Yeah boo, I'm wanting you, wonder if you wanting me 
 Taking you to ecstasy or whatever your destiny, trust in me 
 Girl, I'm wanting you, everyday I'm missing you 
 Visions of me kissing you, goddamn, I'm missing you 
 Yeah boo, I'm wanting you, wonder if you wanting me 
 Taking you to ecstasy or whatever your destiny, trust in me 
 'Cause I'm wanting you, everyday I'm missing you 
 Visions of me kissing you, goddamn, I'm missing you 
 Yeah boo, I'm wanting you, wonder if you wanting me 
 Taking you to ecstasy or whatever your destiny, trust in me 
 Girl, I want you, I could see your silhouette 
 Telling me you're soaking wet while we having phone sex 
 Better yet I'm on my way, I'ma do whatever you say 
 Where ever you tell me kiss, I'ma spread your legs like this 
 'Cause baby girl, I'm wanting you, I can't get that fast enough 
 What the fuck you done did to me? I can't hit that, that's enough 
 Matter fact unlock that do', I'ma be there 'fore you know 
 Turn on your radio and make sure it's something slow 
 'Cause baby girl, I'm wanting you, everyday I'm missing you 
 Visions of me kissing you, goddamn, I'm missing you 
 Yeah boo, I'm wanting you, wonder if you wanting me 
 Taking you to ecstasy or whatever your destiny, trust in me 
 'Cause I'm wanting you, everyday I'm missing you 
 Visions of me kissing you, goddamn, I'm missing you 
 Yeah boo, I'm wanting you, wonder if you wanting me 
 Taking you to ecstasy or whatever your destiny, trust in me 
 I ain't with that nonsense or that luvy-duvy mess 
 I wanna fuck you nice and slow but they want some of that Georgia dick 
 Get you some of this Memphis wet pussy 'cause it be the best 
 Smashing all across the bed, now I'm gonna give you head 
 Nothing but sex is on my mind, so I'm not gon' waste your time 
 I'ma let you bang the pussy from the front and from behind 
 Give it to me, Pastor Troy, oh my God, I love you, boy 
 I'ma make you scream my name, doing all kind of freaky thangs 
 You ain't gonna forget the mystic pleasure that I give to you 
 Have your ass lay back on the bed 
 Thinking what have I just done to you 
 Think about me when you fuck your bitch 
 Close your eyes and imagine this 
 I told you I ain't the type to get involved in long relationships 
 I just like when you lick between, man, I feel like I'm on lean 
 Now yo got me so-so high, I'm glad we on each other team 
 Fuck my nigga, fuck yo bitch, man, we on some other shit 
 You wondering, don't wonder, man, I love you and it's my dick 
 Girl, I'm wanting you, everyday I'm missing you 
 Visions of me kissing you, goddamn, I'm missing you 
 Yeah boo, I'm wanting you, wonder if you wanting me 
 Taking you to ecstasy or whatever your destiny, trust in me 
 'Cause I'm wanting you, everyday I'm missing you 
 Visions of me kissing you, goddamn, I'm missing you 
 Yeah boo, I'm wanting you, wonder if you wanting me 
 Taking you to ecstasy or whatever your destiny, trust in me 
 'Cause I'm wanting you
