Satan's order brought to me 
 Disciple of darkness, that I be 
 Come dark children, stand as one 
 Prepare to fight, the war has just begun 
 Let us devour the day 
 Reeking chaos all the way 
 Serving Satan at his best 
 We the dark ones never rest 
 Let us play the game of dead 
 Never showing any dread 
 Mercy in us you'll never find 
 With your holy weaken mind 
 Chaos in Hell!... Hail Satan's faith! 
 To the greater glory of Satan 
 Darkness given, darkness taken 
 What you see is what you 
 ll get 
 Satan's servants no regrets 
 Come to me my child to be 
 Serpent's tail will succor thee 
 Mercy in us you'll never find 
 With your holy weaken mind 
 Hear my voice from the grave 
 For evil calling need not save 
 In your mind you will see 
 With the dark your destiny 
 He will kill you, make you bleed 
 Drink your blood and make you scream! 
 Chaos in Hell!... Hail Satan's faith! 
 Chaos in Hell!... Hail Satan's faith!
