Predestinations of the world 
 Lies lost, ill-fated doings 
 Global sickness, raging plagues 
 Unceasing remnants 
 Premonitions are clear to see 
 Few futile attempts to savior 
 Foreboding fear is insufferable 
 The time, the end prevails 
 Foreboding fear is insufferable! 
 Insufferable! 
 From the Dark bowers of holy 
 Man's domain 
 Is the ruthlessness 
 Action of mortality 
 Predestinations of the worlds, 
 Profilitions of war 
 Fear dogmatic mass hate 
 Heed grave warnings!
