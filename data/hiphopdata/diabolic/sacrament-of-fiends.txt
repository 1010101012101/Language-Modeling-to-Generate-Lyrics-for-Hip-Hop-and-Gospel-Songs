Enter into the realm of Diabolic 
 The epitome of God we destroy 
 With grinding force 
 And wickedness 
 An aim to conquer 
 And reign... unholy! 
 Unseen lies the plague 
 Released in a furious manner 
 Strengths within thy circle 
 Powers of defiant... Gods! 
 Sinful ways, lusts in reality 
 Engulfed in the image 
 Penetrating nightshade vision 
 Satisfy the vigorous yearning! 
 Penetrating nightshade vision 
 Satisfy the vigorous yearning! 
 Hellish in this mortal world 
 Possessed with 
 Immeasurable hate 
 Blacken souls potency aligned 
 Embodies the infinite accuser!
