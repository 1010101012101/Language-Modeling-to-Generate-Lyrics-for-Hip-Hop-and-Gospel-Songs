Immersed in spiritual servitude 
 From further nations astray 
 Devious tempers coming towards 
 Their cultic anger now disturbed 
 Oppressive megalomaniacs 
 Thinking they have the right 
 To nullify a hope for peace 
 Murder the life of innocence 
 Assassinate for invocations 
 No one hears their prayers 
 Exhorting, exhorting 
 To a weak messiah 
 Suicide missions befall 
 Benighted underground terrorists 
 Oppose the political deliverance 
 Rampant running with fear 
 Barbaric reasons are unclear 
 Planting the seed in their heads 
 Slaying bombs of bloodshed 
 Slaying seeds of insanity 
 Brainwashed fanatics of divinity 
 Ancient hatred!
