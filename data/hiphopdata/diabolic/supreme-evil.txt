The second comig 
 Spewing forth the arrival 
 Has not been seen 
 In blacken years 
 And eruption 
 Predicten by elder wisdom 
 The Almighty 
 Doing forth 
 With battle 
 With fury 
 The fires burning 
 From the throne 
 The evident 
 The baptismal of hatred 
 Is obliterating 
 From chambers of blasphemy 
 The mystic crimes 
 Chorus of ungodly howls 
 Fearing lamb screams 
 Utopia through lust 
 Carnal in nature 
 Subjugate the goddess 
 Mesmerized by pleasure 
 Anoint the unholy 
 Cursed and consumed 
 Taste the divine 
 Of the supreme evil!
