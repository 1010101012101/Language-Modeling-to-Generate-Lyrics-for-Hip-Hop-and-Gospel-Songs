Follow a man that your father is not 
 A symbol to some the stranger becomes 
 Just as dangerous as the stick 
 Hiding behind the children 
 Trust him with your every thought 
 Believe in him is what we're taught 
 He will never bring you harm 
 Confess your sins with open arms 
 Bring him to a place unseen 
 That is were he begins to please 
 His frame of mind is of trust 
 Until Satan takes his hold 
 Twist the mind of the righteous 
 That's where Satan works best 
 To take the church and destroy 
 Pedophile of a little boy 
 Go pray to god who is just a lie 
 Can't stop the lust of his fellow servants 
 Suffering church won't be the same 
 Suffering church only god to blame 
 Descended into a world of sin 
 Forgiveness lost eternal suffering then begins!
