Our legion stands glorious, blasphemous 
 Again and again 
 We trample religious fucks 
 We will advance 
 Exalting our lord 
 Until slavery spans the whole of the universe 
 Hail! Evil! 
 Hail! Beelzebub! 
 Reeling in pain 
 In the halls of flame 
 I curse their souls in Jesus' name 
 Blacking out resistance 
 In the path of Satan 
 Bow or die 
 Sacrifice! 
 Eternal, is our love for hatred 
 Undying, is our lust for war 
 Our blades are begging to cleave their flesh 
 Abysmal, is our wake of death 
 Their faith has reached critical mass 
 Jehovah's reign of terror ends, at last 
 Our legion, victorious 
 Devour the Subconscious 
 Hail! Evil! 
 Hail! Lucifer!
