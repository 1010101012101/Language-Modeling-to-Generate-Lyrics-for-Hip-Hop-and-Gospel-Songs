Rupture, Sliced 
 I see your insides, slowly die 
 With your Christ, return to your God 
 Your heart is full of the most bitter hate 
 It's too late for you, you'll never be saved 
 Satan's waiting, in your grave 
 Satan's waiting 
 You lack the courage to walk free 
 Imprisoned indeed 
 I vomit on your book of slavery 
 And I intend for you to bleed 
 As our ancient brothers 
 You will die for your beliefs 
 You will be slaughtered as harbingers of defeat 
 Impotent father and his worthless seed 
 Impotent father 
 Evulsions of the soul. No ability to seal the wound properly 
 Evulsions of the soul. No ability to heal the wound 
 Evulsions of the soul 
 Maligned and confined 
 Sign of the times 
 Molestation of the mind 
 Go to your God, go to your Christ 
 Now you will die, now you will die 
 Evulsions of the soul!
