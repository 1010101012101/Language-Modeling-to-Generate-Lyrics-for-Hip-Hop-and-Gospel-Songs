The word of God 
 Crippling their minds 
 The words of evil 
 Seem so divine 
 Living their lives 
 Search for salvation 
 We live for darkness 
 And embrace damnation 
 Paralyzed children of Christ 
 Blindly following his ways 
 Self deceit, believing his lies 
 Heaven awaits when they die! 
 You have been deceived! 
 Break the cross, 
 A Christian epidemic 
 Destroy with disgust, 
 Faith is only a crutch 
 Hypocrisy, confessing evil sins 
 Confined to slavery, 
 Hail the Demise!
