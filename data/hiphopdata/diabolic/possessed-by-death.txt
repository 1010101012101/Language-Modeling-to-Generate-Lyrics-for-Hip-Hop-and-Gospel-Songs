Possessed by Death! 
 Your number is up! 
 You're on the edge of sanity 
 And you're about to jump 
 The only way to cure this pain 
 Is sell your soul and live again 
 Impulses contort your thoughts 
 Censorious self loathing 
 You've worshipped evil 
 Your existence 
 But realization escapes you 
 Beyond your darkened vision 
 Lies distortion and illusion 
 Obsessed with life but possessed by death 
 Murder is what we have left 
 The priest you always hated 
 The victim you always wanted 
 The puppet must die 
 Before the master's eyes 
 Desecration is in order 
 And I will be your sight 
 Slide in with the full moon light 
 With a noose of razor wire 
 He tried to escape 
 But his fate was sealed 
 The moment that he knelt 
 Now he will melt 
 He will melt in the cauldrons of hell 
 Praying and begging and pleading 
 For anything else
