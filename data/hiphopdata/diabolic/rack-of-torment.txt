Psychotic sadistic man, 
 Obssessed with malevolence 
 Maker of the macabre, 
 Desires to see humans suffer 
 Kills as he pleases 
 With sinister, ghastly ways 
 Lunatic of society 
 Tortures his victims so hideously 
 Dead! 
 Strapped down and gagged 
 Electrocution your fate 
 1000 watts to the 
 Nervous system 
 Black charred body remains 
 Peeling off burnt flesh 
 Gouging out the eyes 
 Guts the inner cavity 
 Body parts are saved 
 Rack of torment 
 Sick demented ways 
 Mentally deranged 
 Killing the only way 
 Putrification, Disintegration, 
 Carrion of butchery 
 Unrelenting sickness 
 Dementia in his brain 
 Neurotic to lunacy 
 Perpetual gore 
 Inhuman rapture 
 Stench of deteriorating bodies 
 Decomposed and dead 
 Bloody stumps of flesh 
 Maggot infested innards 
 Decapitated bodies 
 Strewn dismembered corpses 
 About flesh hungry 
 Cannibal victims for his meals 
 Dead! 
 Haunting thoughts 
 Of an actual person 
 Grotesque human behavior 
 But what motivates 
 Repulsive to the suffering 
 Snapping and going berserk 
 Brutality and horror 
 But never feels remorse
