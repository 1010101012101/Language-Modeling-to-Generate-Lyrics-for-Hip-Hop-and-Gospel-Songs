Been here for too long, said it's time to ride 
 Got to push it on 'cause I'm 
 (1, 2) 
 Been here for too long, yes, it's time to fly 
 Got to get along 'cause I'm late for the sky 
 Been here for too long got, to 
 'Cause I'm late for the sky 
 I dream what these wings won't do 
 'Cause counting sheep's as easy as 1, 2 
 Jumpin' out the nest to catch some bird food 
 Clutch so tense that the knuckles turn blue 
 I been hooped the wise man check horizon 
 Read the flight plan, spread the life span 
 Sky heights are set, it's time to climb these steps 
 We only tryin' to get free from the spiders' web 
 Gotta murder all the messin' around 
 Carry the burden of work, never settin' it down 
 With a spot light now my shot my chance 
 Put a plot of land in the pockets of my pants 
 Break roots, raise roof when the kick drops 
 They flew straight, threw no pit stops 
 Lift off with your head in the clouds 
 Or get lost in the rest of the crowd 
 Been here for too long, said it's time to ride 
 Got to push it on 'cause I'm (1, 2) 
 Times are come and gone, yes, it's time to ride 
 Early in the morn, late for the sky 
 Been here for too long, said it's time to ride 
 Got to push it on 'cause I'm late for the sky 
 Times are come and gone, yes, it's time to fly 
 Got to get along, late for the sky 
 Years of quotable slash, rap notable slash 
 Mich on but Janet still controlling you 
 I'm ready, handed my view panoramic 
 My eyes wide shut if not one a hole in 2 
 I'm packin' double, getting up too early 
 I'm actually troubled, kinda actin' 730 
 Attracted to this earth, maybe actin' kinda worldy 
 Runnin' on my work that says EV, I better hurry 
 I rather worry that then being pushed through the line 
 Still a perfect wrecker jet never late when I fly 
 Movin' hectic test the patience of this time when I rhyme 
 Not an odd to death of dyin' sayin' late for the sky 
 Late for my prime but something that was shaped by design 
 I been runnin' while the others burn from racin' the line 
 Makin' it great coincides with makin' it mine 
 Coincides with the hate that I'm makin' it signs 
 Let me start from the beginning now 
 Rewindin' the clock, I pitch my heart in every inning 
 Like I did with the knock and it don't stop a body in motion 
 Stays in motion coach seat between the wings of this Boeing 
 Been here for too long, said it's time to ride 
 Got to push it on 'cause I'm (1, 2) 
 Times are come and gone, yes, it's time to ride 
 Early in the morn, late for the sky 
 Been here for too long, said it's time to ride 
 Got to push it on 'cause I'm late for the sky 
 Times are come and gone, yes, it's time to fly 
 Got to get along, late for the sky 
 From a chicken wire frame in a house of wax 
 To a rocket exploding into a cloud of bats 
 I been it dog meat in a 76 Plymouth sitting 
 Bitch antenna divide 'em for live witches 
 Have you buried a corpse, can you suture a wound? 
 Do you get a fuzzy feeling when the beautiful lose? 
 Like a behooving of a crew to snap Buddha, enthuse greatly 
 Prove a definitive crucible of mood making 
 Four wolves find me to speak as an eye witness 
 We will be closing in 5 minutes, find spinach 
 Not a pleasantry but stirring only enemies of mercy 
 A plebeian centipede's unearthing something dirty 
 Same nature later snap on his shoes 
 Maybe they ratty 'cause they actually a hat for his hoops 
 And anger every perfect pivot to the city's nervous system 
 Till I make the following preferred decision, listen 
 Been here for too long, said it's time to ride 
 Got to push it on 'cause I'm (1, 2) 
 Times are come and gone, yes, it's time to ride 
 Early in the morn, late for the sky 
 Been here for too long, said it's time to ride 
 Got to push it on 'cause I'm late for the sky 
 Times are come and gone, yes, it's time to fly 
 Got to get along, late for the sky
