(Chorus: dmx) 
 I got dawgs in l.a 
 I got dawgs in toykyo 
 I got dawgs in paris 
 I got dawgs in moscow 
 (Verse 1: drag-on) 
 I mix coke with smoke till ya choke 
 Cause y'all got nothin' ta provoke 
 So when you die, rememba ta leave a note 
 Cause my dawgz will slit yo thoart 
 Drag on bitch you hear it here first 
 It ain't nothin' to quence ya thirst 
 You faggotz and my bitch don't flirt 
 Dmx: 
 You don't fuck wit x cause ill blow you 
 I hate little jews like the fuckin' mew mews 
 I'm threw so never say p-u 
 Or ill make ya rape young dru 
 And remember this shit is new 
 So remember to bring yo crew 
 And remember I hate blue 
 (Chorus: dmx) 
 I got dawgs in l.a 
 I got dawgs in toykyo 
 I got dawgs in paris 
 I got dawgs in moscow 
 (Verse 2: styles) 
 I'm a fuckin' crack sniffa jump in a rivea 
 And slit you stomach till ya bleed liva 
 So you betta shiva I hate the man 
 Who gets sun tans 
 'Cause I shot him and he ran 
 Evidence:

 And you know I'm that kind of guy

 And rape yo bitches like bill nye

 And I always lie so fuck soso def, fine! 
 (Chorus: dmx)

 (Verse 3: sheek) 
 Yes I fucked her, till she 
 Said burr and called me mista 
 Her name was crista 
 So I will pick, your friend nick is a prick 
 (Swizz beatz)

 Then I will cut his dick 
 Till he says frick 
 So remember your click and don't lick 
 Or
