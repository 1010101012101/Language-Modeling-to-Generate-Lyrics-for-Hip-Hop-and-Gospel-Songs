One-liner flow, see it in my liner notes 
 The kind of ideas make it seem like the thoughts took 
 Three hundred and sixty-five nights, I picture the high life 
 Pool side, made my own terms from lonely nights 
 (See 'em with all my dogs out here right now) 
 Born our own flow, they say old soul with kid's energy 
 Still draw from my torso for enemies by any means 
 I seen what it's worth, a curse, snakes and centipedes 
 Venomous, seems the only safe place is Venice Beach 
 (Back home, right here) 
 I try to wrong my rights, I try to right my wrongs 
 I try to write my songs, shine lights but the night is gone 
 Daybreak becomes the encore 
 Can't tell the date or state because I'm on tour 
 A young kid pumping De La Soul, I spit live, you could say, no go 
 Sixteen, not a day, no flow, I grew up a nervous skater 
 Some headed for greatness, others serve as waiters 
 Some nameless, others was stars 
 And straps ain't famous, steel that ain't stainless 
 High haters, peace signs, see you later 
 Lying for no reason, quit trying, it's breezy 
 Easy target, walked up in Florida Gators (Step, step) 
 Origin Lost Angels, support Lakers 
 Four-finger discounts, this an ounce my fortress 
 Portraits of my get-down, live from Belgium stages 
 L.A. made 'em, L.A. grazed 'em, and L.A. saved 'em 
 It's back to the Beach, bitch, where Miss Taylor raised 'em 
 My mama opposite of Sarah Palin, with no gat from Russia 
 Looking back like "Quit playing," Ev' is here staying 
 I won't change nothing 
 Lord forgive me for all of my sins 
 But I won't change nothing
