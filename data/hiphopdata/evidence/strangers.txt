If it's one thing I've learned that I've written down on paper 
 It's never leave some weed on the table with a stranger 
 Shit, I could barely even trust my friends 
 Maybe with my lady, not trees of the mends 
 I mean really why even should I try and test it socially 
 Catch them in the act and end up having to approach them 
 Entertain the story while it's testing on my patience 
 Why the fuck you think I spent this money on some? 
 While I'm on the other side of Earth without assistance 
 Hitchin' in the night sayin' Evy goes the distance 
 At home the same shit is goin' on, I don't miss it 
 It's a nice place to live, but I wouldn't wanna visit 
 Never steppin' out the car or on the stage without a purpose 
 Ghost-ride the whip like I'm ghost writing verses 
 Afraid to come and go so I take fame in little doses 
 Director of these photos so the aim remains focused 
 Hold still right there, hold still 
 I ain't holier than though or tryin' to even act superior 
 Half the shit I rap about I'm speaking from experience 
 I'm livin' at the beach, about as west as the Earth goes 
 People get deceived, seein' gangsters dressed in surf clothes 
 From ? where they birthin' those flows to set the world off 
 On a wet park bench drinkin' OJ and Smirnof 
 I seen it through my own three and speak it how I heard it 
 Never tell it how it wasn't ? that murder 
 I been tourin' constantly so there's wear and tear value 
 That merits all the lows to terrace highs and travel 
 Document this madness till the day I come unraveled 
 And retreat to the Matterhorn, baskin' in the castle 
 On some Dennis Leary Asshole, fuck you pay me shit 
 I've come too far to get jacked and? 
 So right about now I think it's 'bout that time 
 That I'mma let Rev kill while I chill on the rhyme 
 What the fuck 
 I ain't speakin' on my businesses in public when concerning deals 
 Steppin' on stage like it's lightbulbs or turning wheels 
 In spite a couple nights of a thousand I didn't kill 
 I still kept it peelin' out and steppin' up for Reverend Real 
 Messages across the board are still remaining pinned up 
 The opposite of dilated eyes that I begin with 
 Nothin' is original even under cloudy days 
 Sun is still shining just rerouted and out of phase 
 Lately when I walk I've been trying to hold my posture straight 
 Hold my chin up then feel the love from across the way 
 California love from Diego to across the bay 
 All across the map to every single solitary state 
 All across the baggage claim, all across the gate 
 Some callin' it afraid how I'm carrying weight 
 Some callin' it fate while some others remain torn 
 Some callin' it rain cause that's when I brainstorm
