I show trust it still ends the same 
 Instead of friends 
 You got friends frontin' only out for your fame 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 Tryna steer through this jungle made of concrete 
 Drew the map on my hand 
 The ink sweatted off me 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 Defense, no charity event 
 And they say, familiarity breeds contempt 
 And I say, this ain't a parody just barely vent 
 What I feel until it's so clear I'm scared of my sense 
 New day, built for the distance 
 Never knew which side to choose till they drew the line of scrimmage 
 I view different sagas, never doubt my outcome 
 They seeing double-vision for invested interests (keep it movin') 
 Win some, you just lost one though 
 Defend what I love, don't give a fuck, the drum's slow 
 I'm an eagle, fuck par for the course 
 Your little birdies seek peace but ain't planned for war, nope 
 L.A., still workin the angles 
 Evy ain't a devil just a greazy angel 
 I got love, got Slug, got drugs, some thugs 
 Still keep it moving never threw my anchor, uh 
 Same son, friends ain't changed (nah) 
 It's a cold game, still sniffin Ronald Reagan cocaine 
 Don't wait, hand and foot on me 
 He's a machine, mechanical antifreeze, hot 
 Light up, the mind of a genius 
 Smoke this cush, there'll be no lies between us 
 Every step I take, dangerous 
 Here we go, three seconds, this message 'bout to self-destruct 
 I show trust it still ends the same 
 Instead of friends 
 You got friends frontin' only out for your fame 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 Tryna steer through this jungle made of concrete 
 Drew the map on my hand 
 The ink sweatted off me 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 Downwind, your new found friend 
 Drew the guilt across the grill just like a clowns grin, I'm all in 
 Tall and thin, tears down walls when the dolphin gets caught 
 In whatever pocket she falls in 
 Shame none, the blame game's done 
 No more sweatin' through the heatwave waiting to make the rain come 
 Gain some, ingrained from the same tongue 
 Can tell by how I bang some everybody wang chung 
 Free-throw, feeble it seems so 
 Break the egg and let the greed grow, beggin' me to reload 
 Heave-ho, behold the super freak show 
 Navigate through people with that life fast, bleed slow 
 Down play, about face, the clay rotates around 
 Whatever it takes to make you count them praise nowadays 
 Show that ace, with no poker face 
 On the belly, open legs and hold the aim between his shoulder blades 
 Square-biz, so terror thick 
 The air is thick with embarrassment, go share it with your therapist 
 There it is, careless to pair with the no-name 
 Tag-wearing, faux-famous derelict 
 Now sit, and wrap yourself around it 
 When your done wear it like an outfit in front of the township 
 Soundcheck, allowed inside of the mix 
 To show 'em all why I'm this make the music with your mouth biz 
 I show trust it still ends the same 
 Instead of friends 
 You got friends frontin' only out for your fame 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 Tryna steer through this jungle made of concrete 
 Drew the map on my hand 
 The ink sweatted off me 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 They tryna cross the line 
 Yeah that's it right there 
 310, 612 
 Ev, Slug 
 Alc 
 Putting these little thumbtacks up all over the map 
 Connecting these dots 
 We watching out for these double-cross cats tryna cross the line 
 You know 
 Give and inch they take feet 
 Give 'em feet they take the street (haha)
