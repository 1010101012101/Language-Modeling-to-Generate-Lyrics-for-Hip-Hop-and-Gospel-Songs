I set it off in the sunny distance, no days existed 
 My patience led the way until the greatest love listened to me 
 I used to play the witness, wait in the trenches 
 It's like the sixth man, sits on different benches 
 It's hard squeezing life in a sentence 
 And if I do, roll carpet with the red tint 
 My entrance is what's between 
 When I exit, it's Evidence left on the scene 
 Alchemist cut the record down to the bone 
 And with a record like this I take the world by storm 
 Sky blessed, the land of the brave 
 Understand where I stand, my hand is made 
 From B R double-O K-lyn in the planet 
 Family landed, managed to raise the man that I became 
 Panic on my first campaign, but when the words fell to place 
 I was certain to reign, I hit the purple, 
 Then step in the circle and start flexin' 
 Weatherman invented, now storms change directions 
 Portions of my proceeds is feeding my homies now 
 I always shared pretty good for an only child 
 I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong 
 Now the role's reversed, I'm putting people on 
 They on welfare, you got health care 
 They used to have their priorities elsewhere 
 I took rims and tires and traded them 
 For a ticket to an island, that's where 
 I wrote this rhyming where I first saw my vision 
 Buy a better living, a place to raise kids in 
 So I think like I rule the world 
 On the brink of something bigger, building schools 
 For boys and girls the thought of home gets me out of my bed 
 I said you got them tools? 
 Get them shits up out of the shed, come on 
 I'm like the interstate of rhyming the Jack Dempsey emcee 
 All my shit costumed out eventually money is made, fly blades 
 A woman with brains, a black nigga reign 
 My lifestyle as a prowler a rich owner, loaner 
 Used to pump at coffees shops had my bitch 
 Who sell with me rolling up fly ass and still classy 
 Asking questions like, "Why you wait on that glass? 
 Why you splash me?" Yo, it's only nigga shit 
 I'mma teach you like how I was taught too 
 Hold the phone, ward two, seeing all kinds of great fossils 
 Colossal juice, ? the house, act fly 
 Got you, no need to walk backwards, fuck with the taxes 
 I speak credibility, the story to m√°sses 
 Yo, a diplomatic winner, Nike boots 
 A scully good denim jean on and? 
 They say you only live once, I disagree 
 You only live twice, your life enable your seed's 
 So I lean on blacks and feed 'em the deeds 
 So when I die they got a foundation on my publishing B 
 Plus the words that I speak, plus my family jewels 
 It ain't all blood diamonds, but ? experienced fools 
 And I be rhyming cool, but my philosophy's deep 
 Like a dear John letter, so read 'em and weep 
 And the wolf smells blood, you can feed 'em to me 
 We can meet in the street, draw heat, but what happened to peace? 
 He got a Dirty Sanchez, like what happened to Screech 
 Jesus, diarrhea, I mean holy shit 
 Christ on a cracker, that's just how we spit 
 Communion had the wine, made the sign of the cross 
 And I will live in the past, chalk it up as a loss 
 Went from "Please listen to my demo!" to stretch limo 
 To the pen in a cell watching Eminem on Jimmy Kimmel 
 But I can't go out like Timbo slice 
 Like Geena Korrano, a cyborg determinate 
 Mano a mano, still Ronald McDonald over one billion served 
 But it's up to me to get what I deserve 
 So I handle my biz and hustle harder than the norm 
 Early bird get the worm, but the hawk gets the bird
