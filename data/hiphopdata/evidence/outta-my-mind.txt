[Chorus] [Evidence]: 
 I know I'm outta my mind 
 I've lost my mind 
 Or just ahead of my time 
 "My brain is insane" - Nas 
 I know I'm outta my mind 
 "I might lose control" 
 Or just ahead of my time 
 "The mind tricks the body, body thinks the mind is crazy" - Black Moon 
 [Verse One] [Evidence]: 
 Rockin' at first was hell without Rakka 
 I pop up in spots they scream "Do Clockwork!" 
 I'm Dilated the fuck off, I ain't doing it 
 Before Weatherman dropped they thought I might have ruined it 
 Elusive I just denied rumors 
 Smile and give punchlines with dry humor 
 See what the future brings 
 In '03 I got on MTV 
 Time is love 
 That's the message I'm sending them 
 Sign with Slug and survive beef with Eminem 
 I mentioned different events in my sentences 
 It's dangerous to reminisce so remember it 
 Still it's Evidence, check one two, one two 
 Less punches and spit what I've been through 
 I stayed here, got booed but kept rappin' 
 The same year got sued by Kurt Macman (fuckin' asshole) 
 [Chorus] [Evidence]: 
 I know I'm outta my mind 
 I've lost my mind 
 Or just ahead of my time 
 "My brain is insane" - Nas 
 I know I'm outta my mind 
 "I might lose control" 
 Or just ahead of my time 
 "The mind tricks the body, body thinks the mind is crazy" - Black Moon 
 [Verse Two] [Murs]: 
 Look I know where I come from and know who I started with 
 But trying to split a check eight ways that's the hardest shit 
 And I ain't starvin' shit 
 I had to get my own 
 So I ain't tryin' to hear that bullshit you on 
 Like you love my brother's my crew more than I do 
 Anytime I make a change I gotta run it by you 
 I wish I would give a fuck 
 I was broke in the hood in the porch in some Chucks 
 The first one sayin' Mid City on these records 
 And made the world respect it 
 Clover Dale, 13 hundred block movin' 
 Sunshine, bomb bitches, that's how we do it 
 And what you doin' man? You shovelin' snow? 
 Throwin' coke up your nose, you win love with the blow? 
 Oops 
 Think I'm dissin' my own crew 
 But I love the Living Legends I was talkin' 'bout you 
 [Chorus] [Evidence]: 
 I know I'm outta my mind 
 I've lost my mind 
 Or just ahead of my time 
 "My brain is insane" - Nas 
 I know I'm outta my mind 
 "I might lose control" 
 Or just ahead of my time 
 "Mind tricks the body, body thinks the mind is crazy" - Black Moon
