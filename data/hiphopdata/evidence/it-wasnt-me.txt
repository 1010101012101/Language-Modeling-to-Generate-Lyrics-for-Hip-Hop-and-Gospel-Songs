Uh, about to tell you who I are 
 Came a long way and I still got so far to go 
 Tee off with this trademark flow and after tonight 
 I'mma let the whole world know 
 My name is Evidence 
 You ain't got no 
 Evidence, evidence, evidence, evidence 
 If this is crime scene cinema 
 All the weak shops closed 
 Is it back to charging motherfuckers four for an O 
 I don't know I keep a rotary phone 
 So I remember all the numbers of my homies who gone 
 Proof is in the pudding 
 I'm pressed up and labeled Evidence 
 But never chasing fame, dragons, chicks, or dead presidents 
 Dreams, but never snatch chains of any measurements 
 Because of my name, for every fuckin' crime they find the relevance 
 Choices in my life that I want to correct 
 I got voices in my head that I want to forget 
 Uh and I don't live with regret 
 But I've been living with a chick while other chicks try to text 
 It wasn't me 
 You ain't got no 
 Evidence (There's no proof without the) 
 Evidence (Who wants truth without the) 
 Evidence, evidence 
 Yeah, my first album only had underground appearances 
 So what's the outcome, I'm still an underground lyricist 
 And fame don't even capture what my interest is 
 I'm halfway to famous, halfway away from infamous 
 My naked eyes are like my memory chips 
 Everything digested comes up when I spit 
 I say so be it without a whistle, call it how I see it (Yeah) 
 Whether in my boundaries or in another region 
 I'm speeding on the highway with my girl shotty 
 Keep a plant in my car, like Good Friday 
 Keep my world Godly I stay grounded like my lobby 
 Aging bucket on the wall but never tat it on my body 
 My music and my graf are livin' separate lives 
 One gets me paid, the other's payin' the price 
 Either way they'll say I'm spraying at night 
 But how the fuck, when I'm touring overseas on a flight 
 It wasn't me 
 You ain't got no 
 Evidence, evidence, evidence, evidence 
 The flow's connected like I knew people 
 Director of photography, I shoot people 
 Named by Will.I.Am, maybe made a milli 
 Maybe I don't give a damn (True) I thought of Evident 
 He mispronounced it, Evidence, fast forward 
 Here we are, standing in the present tense 
 I never thought about fame 
 I just thought about if K.R.S. would know my name 
 But since then it's like so much has changed 
 Body baggin' the shows, they say I'm killing the stage 
 It wasn't me 
 You ain't got no 
 Evidence, evidence, evidence, evidence
