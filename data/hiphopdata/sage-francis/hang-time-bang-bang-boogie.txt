Bang, bang, boogie 
 Up jumps the party 
 I know your name 
 And the hours that you operate are grave 
 Yard, Shift my body weight out the gates 
 He came 
 Like a thief in the night 
 This hell hounded off his leash 
 Teeth clenched tight 
 You might know my face 
 Not the expression that it's left in 
 When I taste 
 A loved one's blood, my forked tongue 
 Makes y'all protect your next of kin 
 Take it like pain killers 
 Spill the pills and medicine right down the drain 
 Flush the evidence 
 Then claim your innocence 
 Bitch, this just isn't their game 
 In fact their rules don't apply here 
 It's a shame that you're going to die here 
 Underneath my thumb print 
 All over some dumb shit 
 Run quick 'cause 
 You're about to get your punk ass beat in public 
 Like bang, bang 
 Bang, bang, boogie 
 He beat down her door 
 With an alibi full of childhood 
 I killed time 
 While it stood still for her 
 Moments must have adjusted accordingly 
 But on his watch 
 The minutes were fast, giving him whiplash 
 Beat by the hands of my clock 
 Lots can happen in an hour 
 For some days don't fly by 
 They make a crash landing 
 I flee by night and only return for emergencies 
 Just so I can listen to the ambulance sing 
 Sirens rang 
 The colors of the flashing lights 
 Painted the town red in the blackest of nights 
 So I will not taint beauty 
 In the ugliest of moments 
 It's that strange side of a poet 
 I'm writing you out of my will to live and let live 
 And to give you some perspective 
 I'm a changed man in that respect 
 You best get professional detectives and motion detectors 
 To protect your relatives 
 That's as much warning as your ass will get 
 I hold my aim 
 This is an invite 
 To my domain 
 Pick me up while I hitchhike 
 On memory lane 
 Sit tight while I backseat drive you insane 
 And beat your brains until you see nothing but pitch white 
 And keep you breathing just long enough to have you explain what it's like 
 And how you like it 
 Convince me 
 I want to believe 
 I want to believe that you bleed 
 I want to believe that you're bleeding 
 Just as much as she did 
 I'll experiment with your life 
 Until I find it's fucking meaning 
 You will hang, hang 
 Bang, bang, boogie 
 She beat back her attackers 
 With a childhood full of alibis 
 As I understood 
 She had to lie 
 The battle cries must have adjusted accordingly 
 Her stopped calls for help never were answered back 
 And for that beat by the hands of my clock 
 Lots can happen in a matter of seconds 
 Ask for a repentance from a looking glass 
 Self shattered reflections 
 Before you blame your anger on adolescence 
 Listen to the symphony of ambulances sing 
 So beautiful 
 So nice 
 Tell me where were you last night? 
 As usual 
 You lied 
 Tell me where the fuck you hide 
 It goes bang, bang, boogie 
 Up jumps the party 
 I always notice when she has new marks on her body
