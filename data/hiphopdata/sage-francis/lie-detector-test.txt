Got a caveman banging on my back door 
 Got a hang man hanging on my front lawn 
 Got an old maid wasting away in the living room 
 Kids in the kitchen with their mouths full of silver spoons 
 Got a paper full of yellow journalism 
 A restraunt waiter selling me words of wisdom 
 The small town crier is chilling with the village idiots 
 The big city slickers are still busy building pyramids 
 Got a dimploma but no wall to hang it 
 Tags on the bathroom stall to make me famous 
 A job description that don't fit the bill 
 A fatal femme fatale dressed to kill 
 Get me out of this, lie detector test 
 My pupils inhale and exhale 
 My breath is a microphone check: 1, 2, what is this? 
 (I wanna give a big special shout out to all the real people out there, keepin' it real, because reality is worth maintaing, you know what I'm saying? keep it up) 
 In a world where these girl's got retro tattoos 
 And all I've got is a gut and velcro black shoes 
 And elbows that move in a way that makes space 
 I'm looking at you (stay awake, stay awake) 
 Natural face affected by the chemical leaks 
 Grammatical mistakes in every sentence I speak 
 It doesn't matter, I make enough sense to seem deep 
 Now look at me (go to sleep, go to sleep) 
 (You know I wanna give a shout out to my boy Reanimator, my man Chris doing his damn thing, keeping me company in this dark ass room, and to all my girls killing ants in the kitchen. Peace baby.) 
 I'm a poor man's version of a rich man 
 I've got a small van swerving through a big land 
 I've got a road map that's looking alot like a math test 
 A blocked phone number and a bunk home address 
 I've got a way out but I ain't trying to use it 
 'Cause I've got some ins and I'm a bet all my winnings 
 If it hurts me more than it hurts you, then I won't hurt you 
 I've got more sense than virtue 
 I've got a cerfew, it's 12 o'clock 
 After that I'll start trembling if I get fed hiphop 
 'Cause I'm a G to the r-e-m-l-i-n 
 If I wasn't then why would I say I am? 
 Get me out of this, lie detector test 
 My pupils inhale and exhale 
 My breath is a microphone check: 1, 2, what is this?
