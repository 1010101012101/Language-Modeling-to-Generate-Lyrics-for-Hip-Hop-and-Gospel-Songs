Maze broken 
 She's runnin' 
 Feet swollen 
 He's comin' 
 She's stolen 
 And before he even knows it she's gone. 
 Tea cups sittin' on the hollow tree stumps 
 He's dumped, and can't seem to swallow these lumps 
 The beat goes on... 
 Same fire 
 New passion 
 Old flame 
 Trade it in for a summer fling 
 There's nothing like that sweet old song... 
 Tip over 
 Root the trees 
 Bend the leaves 
 Blend in with the open wound 
 The freeze frames keep him warm... 
 The day's frost is scraped off the weight loss 
 The new sign that says keep off 
 As he speeds off into the storm... 
 Out of spite the lighting strikes him twice 
 He's peeking out on the pike and cheatin' life 
 Peeling out on the lawn 
 Now he's idling 
 His time is dwindling 
 In his mind he's figuring out life's about the little things 
 And his labyrinth 
 And all his magnificence can only keep the mice trapped 
 The princess is innocent 
 She doesn't belong... 
 (I never thought I'd miss you) 
 They had a ceremony where he put her in a bridle, the headstall... 
 She stopped to think for a minute, and in a split second went AWOL. 
 (I never thought I'd miss you) 
 He draws in the chin as in a expression of resentment or scorn 
 He's pullin' on the reigns, the bridle, the shower the storm 
 The maze, the high tower, clouds are at war... 
 The reigns, the bridle, the shower, the storm... 
 The maze, high tower, clouds are at war 
 The reigns, the bridle, the shower, the storm... 
 The maze, the high tower, clouds are at war, clouds are at war, clouds are at war...
