They'VE said it every year but this times it seems like 
 The end is near and I'm in line to see the light 
 How far does this black tunnel go 
 I got a car but the gas is running low 
 And as long as I've known the bumps and creeks of this house 
 It's starting to make the types of sounds that only comes from people's mouths 
 You can't tell me it's still settling 
 Built on an Indian burial ground killing everything 
 The childhood scar on my chin is back again 
 That old jump over my own leg dance move has to end 
 I've seen better days in my night terrors 
 I was a bike messenger without a bike and I would write letters 
 Ask directions TO YOUR whereabouts 
 Before the slow walk the rest of the show-offs were pealing out 
 To many hares only one TORTOISE 
 That's why I left this city, toO fast paced for this HO-HUM tourist 
 By the time I developed the pictures 
 They're as blurry as my memory of constant life fixtures 
 If distance is a girl's best friend 
 Tell them bitches in the rough who think that love comes with DIAMONDS 
 Slave labor, you made me work for what I couldn't have 
 Diamonds cut, BUT COAL burns and nothing lasts forever 
 Don't know why I bothered saving any of your letters, they're just aged paper 
 Crumbling 
 Slave labor, you made me work for what I couldn't have 
 Diamonds cut, the cold burns and nothing lasts 
 Wonder why I saved your urn of ashes 
 I've got an insecurity box for your mail 
 Tracing the name on the return address as if it was made of braille 
 Pretended it was your finger but careful to not break a nail 
 The one that sealed the coffin shut. When it opened caused a paper trail 
 But since then I buried your dead sea scrolls 
 And emptied my head of these old trivial memories that I seem to hold 
 Now you're a foot note with cement shoes 
 In case you wonder what that sinking feeling has been ever since I left you
