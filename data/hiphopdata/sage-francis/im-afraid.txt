SONG: I'm Afraid (feat. Sole and Adeem) 
 AUTHOR: Sage Francis 
 Nobody likes me 
 I've got nothing funny to say 
 And they're gonna find out what I really believe in 
 Well how about we trade stories about relationships and worries 
 I'm afraid of seeing things clearer 
 Everything's blurry 
 I'm scared of the dark 
 With the idea of being alone 
 And I'm being brave in the eyes of a mirror 
 Whistling in harmony 
 Breaking bones in the grove 
 I know nothing 
 But that's better than not acknowledging 
 From here you're hearing my laughter 
 Laughter's my escape 
 But I really have no idea 
 I have no breathe to take 
 Inhale, while my options are still alive 
 Walking through the valley of life hummingly shout suffice 
 At this point at the ceasing endlessness 
 I'm still afraid she doesn't love me as much as her new man and kids 
 I'm afraid I left her in the blizzard to die 
 So I'm questioning the whos, the befores, the answers, and the whys 
 I'm not concerned that my awareness has been heightened 
 I'm really not scared, just a little bit frightened. 
 I'm not concerned that my awareness has been heightened 
 I'm really not scared, just a little bit... 
 I'm afraid Adeem doesn't always know his bars 
 I'm afraid I'm a big superstar 
 I'm afraid that my penis is too big 
 I'm afraid that I'm never gonna have kids 
 I'm afraid that this is the fifth bar 
 I'm afraid 
 I'm scared of nothing, reverse psychology taking over my intimidation 
 With living and sitting when I have a destination 
 Well deserved lesson learned 
 My fingers avoid any objects with colors 
 The difference might be allergic to any difference possessed by me 
 I can't count past three 
 Large amounts frighten me 
 Close my eyes want to be enlightened 
 Shattered a mirror now luck has run away 6 years 364 days of grace 
 Can't begin due to my fear of premature ending 
 Planning to be the same abstract 
 I wasn't raised like that 
 Cover your mouth and wrap your surroundings 
 Head is pounding from deep thoughts 
 Hope that I'm not the one that will get caught 
 Dark water is my enemy and boats make me nervous 
 Watch my pronunciation just to be courteous 
 Have nightmares about everyone else's opinion 
 And some way I'm intimidated by women and little children 
 No questions, 'cause I have no answers 
 I hold my breath waiting for god to enlighten me and give me cancer 
 Never the leader followers have no face obsess my image 
 Walking lines put me in a better place 
 Race to the middle I can't make a decision 
 Afraid that while I'm driving the key will fall out the ignition 
 The finish is invisible with so many more miles to travel 
 Only walk in the daytime 'cause I'm afraid of my own shadow 
 I'm scared of writing songs about what I'm afraid of 
 Emotionally I'm in a paradox because I hate love 
 And I laugh at tears 
 Absence stares at me and sees I'm present 
 I'm scared of being wrapped up in fluorescent lighting 
 Fighting fears about facial flaws 
 I never practice my vertical cause breaking nature's laws 
 Might be more scarier than proving wrong social construct 
 Reaching for insurance I put my arms up 
 Wave it side to side but then I was afraid 
 You wouldn't think I would've cared 
 No I'm not scared I'm terrified
