Had one too many one way conversations 
 With the licky licky lord 
 Till I grew a scissor tongue 
 And c-c-cut the cord 
 Put the phone on the floor 
 Detach the wires in my head 
 Took awhile to accept that that line was dead 
 Didn't never wanna not live forever x3 
 Didn't never wanna not not wanna live 
 Nah, it didn't matter if the laughter didn't come after the bad joke, 
 If I was down with the filthy rich or flat broke, 
 Accepted by the Aryans or black folk 
 'Cause I was carrying this weight until my back broke, 
 Wasn't trying to be no hip hop god or raps G.O.A.T. 
 Shootin to be a rock star like it's my last hope 
 Eyeballin that pack of smokes DO ME IN! 
 Graduatin on the crack coke DO ME IN! 
 Knocked of a paddle boat in the middle of the castle moat 
 Kings men are yelling GRAB THE ROPE! 
 Three sheets to the wind three! 
 Three sheets to the wind! 
 I talk like a sailor, my mother is one 
 That's why I got this sixth sense of direction and my split tongue 
 Taught me how to go with the flow when the winds come 
 Curled up in a ball and tried to hide inside a kick drum. 
 While the crew is gettin' piss drunk I had to purify my own and drink up 
 I had to save and conserve recycle my salty words to keep the meat on my bones all pres-s-s-served. 
 It was a tug of war and we all fought together 
 Till we went our own way when the c-c-c-cord was severed 
 The stormy weather would begin, we'd all sucumb to this sin 
 Any bar within reach, Three sheets to the wind 
 From a back pedal the backstroke got traded in my life jacket for a mask and cloak 
 Three sheets to the wind 
 I had to go, watch the sail grab the rope 
 See shanty ending on a sad note, three sheets to the wind 
 Malnutrition (Pull me in), Bad Religion (Pull me in), Fact or Fiction that's addiction 
 Three sheets to the wind 
 Pick it up, put it down 
 Three sheets to the wind
