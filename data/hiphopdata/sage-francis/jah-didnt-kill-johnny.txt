Yeah. Holler at ya boy 
 Holler at your boy. Do shit 
 Do remember, Holler at your boy 
 Go back, a few weeks on this one. Go way way back 
 This life ain't for everyone, 
 But for some of us. Yeah. Life is easy 
 This song right here, going out a childhood mentor of mine, father John. 
 Holler. 
 Touched me as a kid, I want you to know, still feeling you. 
 Life is easy 
 Jah didn't kill Johnny 
 He had a date with death 
 It was a slow train coming 
 And we've all got a train to catch 
 But Lord, take your filthy claws off the rest of my freinds. 
 That is, of course, if they ain't already dead. 
 I make no demands. I just make amends. 
 I make my bed and I'm a lie in it 
 But before I die... please... don't take anymore of my friends. 
 Please don't take anymore of my friends. Life is easy. 
 The smoke didn't kill Johnny. The drink didn't kill Johnny. 
 The junk didn't kill Johnny. And the women didn't kill Johnny. 
 Was it the road? I don't know. Was it rock and roll? I don't think so. 
 But God, God, God, God, God... would never... kill... Johnny Cash 
 He had a train to catch. 
 He had a date with death 
 And we've all got a train to catch. 
 Life is easy. Holler at ya boy. Life is easy.
