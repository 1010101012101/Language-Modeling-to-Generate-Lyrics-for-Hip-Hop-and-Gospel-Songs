Sad sad monster 
 Turn those horns up 
 Burn the back roads 
 Find your way out 
 Troubled love life 
 Give the gift of 
 Yourself 
 To the dark. 
 Ground control to lost soul 
 Ground control to lost soul 
 If you copy 
 Come in lost soul 
 Come in lost soul 
 We lost contact,

 Don't these dead streets back you into bad corners 
 Curbs crumble once you park yeah I saw them (sit down) 
 Parking meters overdue, violation goes unnoticed 
 Out of all of those who try to travel off road you come the closest 
 I grant you this toast (this toast) 
 For all of those who showed promise and never made one that broke 
 I salute you 
 I never meant to lose you but I know this road don't go where it used to 
 I got a map that looks a lot like your veiny arms 
 It ain't to scale but the details the names of the songs 
 And this one is called Careful Fight Blues 
 A manipulative twist I think that Manson might have used (ooh) 
 But poor musicians come a dime a dozen 
 And you're the egg man a flash in the pan and your yolk is running 
 Who broke that hard outer covering 
 Some chick in your mix you couldn't level with 
 Headless horsemen come the suffering 
 Go the direction 
 Following air currents but it was my drift you're supposed to be catching 
 Fishnets collect dust in stagnant water 
 Haven't heard back from you since the gag order 
 Pussycat got your tongue? 
 Pick it up up up up up up up (end communication) 
 Ground control to lost soul 
 Ground control to lost soul 
 If you copy 
 Come in lost soul

 Bad, bad actor. Flip that script now. Come on! 
 You cock. Bust my shit! Whoa! 
 You 
 You're a lint ball who moves on the whim of the wind 
 Confused flexible movement for freedom 
 (That ain't free) 
 If the walls you keep bouncing off of keep closing in 
 There's only so much time before your rhythm gets broken 
 I can hear it speeding up before we lost signal 
 It caused a ripple effect 
 Rings on the radar would intersect 
 Now your fingers are off limits 
 I can't hold your hand longer than your attention span 
 The two way street we're supposed to meet on 
 It's a one-way dead end 
 You're some of my best friends press send. 
 Where are the doughnuts you've been lost inside 
 Tow trucks you've been forced to ride 
 Holdups at the border line 
 Customs will confiscate costumes, eat my dust 
 We get exhausted force-fed by car fumes 
 I can't afford the duty tax so expensive 
 Come off your head trip and visit where your old friends live 
 You're sensitive like the time (critical) 
 You swore to God on a lie and didn't die (you're invincible) 
 Kiss the pavement 
 Make love while cars spin 
 Be careful when the unsafe sex-parade comes a-marchin' 
 They've got full body condoms to carry you off in 
 I wish I told you that while we were still talking 
 Ground control to lost soul 
 Ground control to lost soul 
 If you copy 
 Come in lost soul 
 Come in lost soul 
 We lost contact, 
 Abort Mission

 (Live performance sample) 
 I'm a motherfucking Bill O'Reilly of this hip hop shit! 
 I want you to give it up for my DJ No Spin Zone!
