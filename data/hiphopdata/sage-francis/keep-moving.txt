I keep moving 
 I go from house to house 
 I stay committed 
 Like one foot in, one foot out 
 I bounce 
 Yeah I'm leaving this place 
 Divorce papers falling out my briefcase 
 Miss Intuition, the half-truth harlot 
 Got her suspicions 
 Lacks proof but wants it 
 I've been practicin grabbin the noose when the knot slips 
 Rewiring my mind to make the firing squad miss 
 And while they're busy reloading 
 I'm decoding the messages she sent with this key I keep holding 
 But it's a copy 
 And the lock seems broken 
 Got me chokin' on discussions I cannot keep open 
 I'm fully clothed in this cock-tease moment 
 The last cigarette sits between my lips 
 But I will not smoke it 
 While it dangled I got strangled by a second hand 
 Broke the ropes when I held my breath and let my chest expand 
 Threw the stogie to the lonely hitman for hire 
 Told him that he owed me and he showed me his hand's on fire 
 We didn't shake on it 
 He nodded, I nodded back 
 He lit the cigarette with his finger and dropped the gat 
 I started walking the tracks you should've tied me to 
 I waited for a train to hop but stopped to say good-bye to you 
 When I turned my head 
 I heard what you said: 
 "Murder him dead and try to do it with the girl in his bed" 
 So I fled 
 As I remembered one should never look back 
 There's no direction home only blood on the tracks 
 Stuck in the past 
 I jetted and left the red footprints for them to follow 
 Headed toward tomorrow 
 And took sips from the flask 
 That you bought me 
 For my sober anniversary 
 Her dad tracks my scent 
 She's got her old man in search of me 
 He knows where I'm headed, he's been there 
 King of the home 
 Sits on his throne like it's an electric chair 
 I'm the heir to that domestic death sentence 
 I see people accepting lethal injections 
 Dead in seconds 
 They confused prison for a bed in breakfast 
 Used their one call on voicemail to see who left a message 
 Could it be her? 
 Could it be!? 
 They're desperate 
 Mad at me 'cause they lack a strategy for exit 
 Nobody pregnant, nobody get burped 
 I got lost on this head trip but won't talk to an expert 
 My legs hurt 'cause I've been walking with cement boots 
 Ever since you lured me to the water bed to get cute 
 She had a wet suit and dry disposition 
 But couldn't execute that type of mission 
 It's no small time thing organizing my ending 
 My book of life 
 Is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" 
 With a circular section 
 You can tell your friends I walked all over you 
 But you know that's not what these boots were made to do 
 In fact, you had them crafted at the store 
 Said, "Baby, slip 'em on" but I don't know what you take me for. 
 I knew what was up once I felt nailed to the floor 
 And since the key didn't work I kicked my way through the door 
 I keep moving 
 I go from house to house 
 I stay committed like one foot in, one foot out 
 I bounce 
 Yeah I'm leaving this place 
 Divorce papers falling out my briefcase 
 I keep moving 
 I go from house to house 
 I stay committed like one foot in, one foot out 
 I bounce 
 Yeah I'm leaving this place 
 Divorce papers falling the fuck out my briefcase 
 I am no destination 
 I am just the journey 
 So don't go settling on me, love 
 No, don't go settling on me 
 I am no destination 
 I am just the journey 
 So don't go settling on me, love 
 No, don't go settling on me 
 I am no destination 
 I am just the journey 
 So don't go settling on me, love 
 No, don't go settling on me 
 Speak of me in your travels 
 Take pictures if you please 
 But don't go settling on me, love 
 No don't go settling on me
