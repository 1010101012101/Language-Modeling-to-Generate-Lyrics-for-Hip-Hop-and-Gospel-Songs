The first thing he says to me 
 "If you could know it all would you want to?" 
 And I'm wondering if it's a question he poses everybody with 
 I was warned about the gift that he's got and the kind of things he sees 
 Me? ... well I got a few tricks up my sleeve 
 I was waitin' for him to show his hand 
 Till I discovered the difference between an old mind and the mind of an old man 
 So I stand corrected, sitting in my chair erect and attentive 
 Wishing that he never asked that question 
 'Cause it echoes in my empty feelings 
 Fearing what's underneath each following sentence 
 Revealing a puzzle piece to the jig saw 
 Of a skin crawling coffee session 
 It's something that his kid saw in me 
 That brought me to his attention 
 And he knows this 
 Who's he think he's speakin' to 
 It's not often that he emerges from his coffin of a reading room 
 On a special occasion he tests his relationship 
 With one who's never read much but he's interested in spaceships 
 His head's stuffed with ancient scripts so he laughs 
 Holds up his golden cup to toast the past 
 Here's to a lack of spontaneity the future has 
 I can tell you when you're gonna die 
 All you gotta do is ask 
 (What's up power trip? big tough guy now? throwing things like that over a cup of joe w/ someone you don't even know, really, you don't know who I am) 
 He sat there, his eyes still weren't focusing 
 He said' "i can see you seeing some things" 
 And I said "yeah, well thanks for noticing. What gave it away - my poker limbs? 
 Cross examined while my hands were busy closing things up into deserts 
 That he's only read about in winter weather 
 And I'm able to fill the gaps that act as traps in the lyrics of letters 
 When mirrors open I bet he thinks I'll enter 
 But I detect ulterior motives in his hidden agenda 
 We live forever in these chairs comparing mental notes 
 Bodies doubling as temporary captains of a rented boat 
 My paper mate sent me to her folks in an envelope 
 Disguised as insurance fraud, some things were never meant to float 
 I've never been in a shipwreck but I know they exist 
 And the experience must be something close to this 
 Hopeless feeling that gets reeled in from oceans for emotions 
 Sick 
 Got me shaking his hand with an open fist 
 What's he notice of my grasp besides the calluses 
 A soul that's trapped by my mind's paralyses 
 Knowing I'll ask his to sign the marriage slip 
 He says "not so fast" 
 And he goes to find his glasses (bastard) 
 Puts on the lenses that were scratched 
 Like someone got the best of him in a cat fight 
 Must have been when he developed that bad sight 
 They don't help, he needs a helmut with a flash light 
 If he thinks he can enter the darkness at half price 
 To find his daughter's black wedding dress from her past life 
 Traditions died at our haunted house party last night
