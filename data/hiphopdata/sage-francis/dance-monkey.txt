Ride. 
 I got two left hooves, two on test. 
 Well, since nobody's steppin' to me 
 (Huh) take me to your cult leader 
 (Huh huh) take me to your local drug dealer 
 Take me to the man in the mirror 
 When you stand and deliver with your hand on the trigger 
 An emotional terrorist 
 I double-M U N E 
 Never make my enemy public 
 I'm a private dancer, dancin' for money 
 Dance monkey, dance you goddamn monkey 
 (Do that thing that's funny) 
 Do I make you wanna laugh? 
 I make you wanna move 
 I make you wanna dodo dododo do 
 (Repeat) 
 Case one carries a paint gun 
 She's unafraid of wavin' when she's gettin' her face done 
 Her favorite radio station's a permanent paid vacation 
 Burnin' her face in the sun 
 She loves repetitive songs that keep playin' 
 You know the repetitive songs that keep playin' 
 She learned all the words and she works it baby 
 Dangerously catchy and she feels it in her cervix lately 
 'Cause the rhythm is a cancer 
 She's on a secret diet 
 A private viewing disease-free TV pilot 
 She saw the future in a group study 
 They threw money in her pants 
 Dance monkey, dance you goddamn monkey 
 (Do that thing that's funny) 
 Do I make you wanna laugh? 
 I make you wanna move 
 I make you wanna dodo dododo do 
 (Repeat) 
 Don't live for the moment -- live for the constant 
 Die for what's right or get killed by your conscience 
 There's a difference between conscience, conscious and conscientious 
 Contrary to popular belief 
 You're none of these 
 There's plenty to feed 
 Empty mouths've been nest bound 
 And kept down and apes won't be bangin' on the chest pound 
 When pacemakers are fragile 
 They thate the taste of capsules 
 They feed their face with paxil 
 Females hate their dads still 
 Holy son's got mommy issues on deck at the podium 
 Holdin' tongues with the rituals 
 More complex than napoleon 
 I told'em 
 "It isn't his job to live in a fog" 
 I don't have a god complex, you've got a simple god 
 (Huh) take me to your cult leader 
 (C'mon) take me to your local drug dealer 
 (C'mon man) take me to the man in the mirror 
 When you stand and deliver with your hand on the trigger 
 And a can of miller in the other 
 You can't kill me motherfucker 
 I got our number, you best disconnect before I call it 
 The bumper sticker on your forehead's the wrong fit 
 When the bomb hits (what music will you look to for shelter?) 
 When the bomb hits (what music will you look to for shelter?) 
 When the bomb hits (what music will you look to for shelter?) 
 Not that mine'll help ya 
 Dance!
