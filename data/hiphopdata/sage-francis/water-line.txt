I just sit there 
 And let the thoughts flood 
 And I remind myself, "It's all right, it's all good, it's all love" 
 It's not though 
 Cause there's a kink in the armor 
 A pot hole I'm sinking in 
 While I think of the drama 
 So I stand up 
 I start to pace in my living room 
 Set my eye to the highway knowing that I'll play chicken soon 
 There's a vanity plate 
 With my name on it 
 There's a Davey Crockett hat with a Masonic fat cat under it 
 A musket rifle spitting at my feet 
 They want me to dance in the middle of the street 
 And I respect my elders, so I do as I'm told 
 But I offset the bell curve when I do it with soul 
 Losing control 
 Guilty feet do have rhythm 
 They just dance to the wrong theme music to amuse the villain 
 Instead of killing, I'll spare the raccoon 
 And start filling sandbags as I stare at the moon and let the thoughts flood 
 Blessed are those who are dammed 
 When the levee broke 
 How many choked on the steps to a slow dance? 
 A staircase to a hug with no hands 
 Accountability hung out to dry on the line of command 
 We let the thoughts flood 
 We remind ourselves "It's all right, it's all good, it's all love" 
 It's not though 
 Cause there's a kink in the armor 
 A pot hole I'm sinking in 
 Sharing a drink with my father 
 It's a family affair 
 The vanity we share 
 The waterline is rising and all we do is stand there [x6]
