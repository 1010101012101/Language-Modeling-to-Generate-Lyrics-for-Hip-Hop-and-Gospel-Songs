It was the (beatboxing) that got me (beatboxing) 
 It was the (beatboxing) break (beatboxing) 
 Deflate 'cause I was gassed 
 Head over heals in love with the electric drums 
 And spoken vocals which was the joke of locals 
 And laughing stock of my rock and roll ass town 
 But the rhythmic acupuncture pierced my skin 
 Pinning the butterflies to my stomach 
 Which would flutter every time I heard the (beatboxing) 
 More than the (beatboxing) 
 I was no devil worshiper 
 Higher level interpreter 
 I refuse to lose focus and recite satanic verses 
 With (????) curses 
 Drug induced worst I know they were saying 
 Kill your mother 'cause it paid them well 
 Yet it my flashback I see the foreshadow 
 Ironic twist my first purchase was a hip hop record 
 Called raising hell 
 I should have run when I had the chance but dmc's 
 Made be wanna breakdance, made me wanna spin vinyl, 
 Made me wanna graph right, made me want to not act white 
 And not to perpetuate any stereotype but 
 I was not about the mullet icehockey haircut 
 You know the mullet, short on top for the fellas 
 Long in back for the ladies, yeah! 
 I was not about stonewash nuthuggies with the French 
 Rolls on the bottom so tight that it turned my toes purple 
 Nor was I about the ripped jean jacket with the megadeath, 
 Metallic, and slayer patch 
 I had an internal itch for the (beatboxing) and never 
 Could I get with () guitar riff, () guitar riff, () 
 I had wild style wars, I rented (blue) street every week 
 As I rocked steady wearing out the play rewind and slow mo 
 Buttons on my vcr 
 I did the pause-play, pause-play, pause-play, pause-play 
 All day forcing my wage comprehension of inner city invention for me 
 Was in the expression which would eventually win the exception 
 (What exception) those around me couldn't give me affection 
 But I played and paid that video attention till I eventually i 
 Completely bit the (beatboxing) 
 And found my new religion, born again b-boy, born to destroy 
 Decoys and be the real mccoy, yeah boy! 
 I wore the clock so you could know the time 
 Chuck d told me to keep a sober mind, and even though his 
 Sidekick liked the flavor of booze, I swear to god 
 Hip hop was about being drug free 
 I swear to god hip hop is about the upliftment of humanity 
 And I swear to god hip hop was what rock was not was what bach 
 Was not was not pop, (pop! pshhhh) 
 Guess I was gassed!, see I remember when dr. dre use to express 
 Himself about hating the chronic, a few years later he's 
 Endorsing it while drinking gin and tonic 
 Suburbanites that blast mace learn their mad face from onyx 
 It was a rat race the first to properly use ebonics 
 Dynamite like jj, but it was a fad like super sonic 
 Hip hop flipped from being artistic to a pop hit 
 Mainstream took control and we cannot stop it 
 It's a black art, being manipulated by white controllers 
 Just like rock and roll is ... we took the (beatboxing) 
 We took the (beatboxing) ...
