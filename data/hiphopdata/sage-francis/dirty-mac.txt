Who's cryin? 
 Who's cryin? 
 Who's cryin? 
 Shut your whining mouth. 
 Your girl's been spending lots of time at my place 
 I been helpin her remove the makeup from her fine face 
 Telling her to go "Au Natural" 
 And she trust me 'cause I'm your pal, that's my style 
 (Vrooom) I drive the Dirty Mac truck 
 Convincing her to drink that whole 30 rack up 
 I sit until I think your girly's mad drunk, then I turn the dirty mac up 
 What you and her, we shacked up 
 Well that sucks, we been getting close lately 
 Special time adds up so don't hate me 
 It's all about bologna draperies, beef sticks, and meat curtains 
 Monthly afternoons of bloody hatchet wounds and grease purses 
 I'm the salt in her pepper, the hop in her steppa 
 The broccoli in her mi-douth, but she don't want no chedda 
 (She don't want no chedda?) Naw she want somethin' betta 
 I'd like to thank you homes you the reason why I met her 
 Who's cryin? 
 Your baby looks like me. 
 Who's cryin? 
 I'm hanging with ya moms. 
 Who's cryin? 
 Dirty Mac aroni and cheese for dinner 
 Who's cryin? 
 Shut your whining mouth 
 Or I'll give you something to cry about. 
 You just won a beauty pagent. 
 Who's cryin? 
 Cuttin' up a whole bunch of unions. 
 Who's cryin? 
 This ain't Dancer in the Dark. 
 Who's cryin? 
 Shut your whining mouth. 
 Shut your whining mouth.
