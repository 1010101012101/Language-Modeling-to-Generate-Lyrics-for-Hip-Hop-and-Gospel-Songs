I'm on fire, I'm on fire 
 Me too, me too 
 Guns yo, I keep one in my pillowcase 
 It keeps me safe when I sleep, still I keep awake 
 What if my dream girl pays a midnight visit? 
 I see the world through the scope but I gain no insight with it 
 When I get introspective I put the safety on 
 Make these songs with the biscuit sittin' in my shaky palms 
 I'm a man now (a real man) 
 Not the one who went to two colleges 
 Grovelling over meal plans 
 I'm starin' at the ceiling fan 
 All wide-eyed 
 Amazed by the ways the blades break the silence 
 I used to be afraid of firin' 
 It sounded startling 
 But now I'm starting to hate the quiet moments 
 Might remind you of a mic 
 By the way I hold it (to the grill) 
 A homophobic rapper 
 Unaware of the graphic nature of phallic symbols 
 Tragically ironic, suckin' off each others' gats and pistols 
 I got more back issues than guns and ammo 
 'Cause my uzi weighs a ton 
 And I never let go of the handle 
 Hangin' on to mommy's pant leg 
 Double-fistin' 
 Knee-deep in shells kickin' ballistics 
 This dick is a detachable penis 
 An extension of my manhood positioned like a fetus 
 An intravenous hook-up feeds bullets to my magazine 
 Nevermind the bullocks, my pistol is a sex machine 
 Guns yo (sex machine) 
 Bust it 
 I got another gun (what) 
 I keep it in my briefcase 
 It keeps me safe at my workplace 
 Cubicle gangster who's in need of his personal space 
 Gangster of love who's unable to look girls in his face 
 'Cause I know that all the stupid people increase the birth rate 
 I'm just about dumb enough to hold up a sperm bank 
 Make my demands and then facilitate fur trades 
 Empty the bird cage and release the mermaids, huh 
 I got a watergun, I keep it in my mouth 
 It keeps me safe from the things I like to speak about 
 But words are leakin' out 
 And all these smiles that I crack 
 Are like a dam on the verge of collapse 
 There ain't no turnin' back 
 In fact I can't hold down my fluids 
 Can't retract statements 
 Without water displacement 
 Flooded the basement, then sought refuge 
 Removed my waterproof vest and then I kicked off my wet shoes 
 Made it to dry land, pistol in hand 
 Fistfuls of ammo riding on a camel through a desert of sand 
 Lucid dreams are a lot like computer screens 
 People have pretentious conversations but I shoot the breeze 
 Blow a hole straight through their long-winded theories 
 Hold my own and make songs for them to sing with me 
 It's the same type of heat that millie used 
 To break the ice with santa claus 
 When she made him sing the christmas blues 
 Capitalists strung her up for killin'em 
 Every manufactured holiday they sacrifice another victim 
 Before wartime depression sets in 
 I get to step in and shoe shine my weapon 
 I'm hemorrhoid, I'm the leader 
 You're dead like de la 
 I hold my crotch like a nine-millimeter 
 Gunz yo 
 (I'm on fire) (me too) 
 (Nine-millimeter) (sex machine)
