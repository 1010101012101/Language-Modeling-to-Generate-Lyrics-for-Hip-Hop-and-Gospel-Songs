Consider me to be a fly on the wall with a bird's eye view 
 I stare, as my birthtime drew near 
 The only earth I knew reared me in a world I grew to fear 
 I do appear quite nude and warm 
 I'm like "what's up with the lights and the white uniforms?" 
 You're damn right you're truly wrong when a hand strikes the newly born. 
 "I can't fight" I'm cruely scorned.in a man's life, the beauty's gone 
 I was scared with fright through the storm 
 I'm prepared to write a mutiny song 
 "It's a miracle ma!" damn my dick is long 
 Oh, that's just the umbellical chord 
 Clip clip, snip snip.and now it's gone along with my foreskin 
 One of them awful things that they do to theoffspring 
 The sting is lessened by the drugs they pump into my miniature body 
 Making us addicts just that quick is their signature hobby 
 An infamous robbery, and if I'm not careful then my shaft'll break 
 It's got me coming up with creative ways to masturbate 
 I wanna be held but my father rebelled and my mother's unconscious 
 I went from a dark bliss to some boxes 
 It's obnoxious the way the doctors poke and prod 
 Seriously I can barely function 
 This is my first out-of-body experience and alien abduction 
 I'm barely a munchkin after just minutes of labor 
 They're putting my tiny footprints on some birth certificate paper 
 My personal hell of isolation began in an incubator 
 To think of it later, slice open my wrist and check the microchip data 
 They didn't capture it on beta film or audio 
 The year made me a dragon, the month made me a scorpio 
 The weak, feeble, helpless baby boy cried for nights 
 But that day was the time of my life 
 But that day was the time of my life 
 But that day, but that day was the time of my life 
 But that day, but that day, but that day, but that day, but 
 That day was the time of my life
