It's the b-boy, it's the MC, they can't read the graffiti 
 It's the b-boy, it's the MJ, it's the VJ they can't read the graffiti on the walls 
 Throw away my tools, scrape with my hands make as much noise as I can banging on sand 
 I used to play in a band but those people are gone 
 Now the turntable got a needle in it's arm 
 I'm in a van flying without parachutes, wifey didn't plan to have marriage disputes 
 Everytime I stand at the door to say goodbye, it's like she's watching her man go to die. 
 I packed in a rush but it was too fast for us, handed me an ultimatum as I grabbed all my stuff 
 Put a pillow in my briefcase I come with no rebates a guarantee of return when I leave state 
 I make mix tapes, but they're CD-r's 
 Diggin in crates, do you see these scars? 
 They're from big breaks that I stripped from a song, now the turntable got a needle in its arm 
 Flame on like burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin', I'm burnin' but wait... 
 I fill up the milk crates, collect the LP's 
 Eric B laughin' at me c-c-check out my melody 
 DJ Polo doin' pawn, terminator X on an ostrich farm 
 Jam master J is gone and that's a shame 
 They say its better to burn out quick than faddddeee 
 I toured the states with a guy named CR, he had nothin' but a tube of toothpaste and guitar 
 He was a soul brother, a baby mama back at home brother 
 A good reminder what it is to rock and roll brother. 
 Mashed potatoes every meal and if it ain't served outa greasy spoon he don't deal 
 Real as it gets with a puff that don't quit put him at a piano and he smokes it 
 A blues man, to old to go back to school man, still grinding it out but he already paid his dues man 
 I could see it in his face when he said Sage brother I gotta get out of this place 
 Embarassed, he knocked me off balance truth of the matter is you can't live off raw talent 
 Perhaps you could at one point but those days seem gone 
 Now the turntable got a needle in its arm.
