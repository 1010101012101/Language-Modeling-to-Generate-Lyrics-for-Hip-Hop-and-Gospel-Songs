Lights are out, phones are dead 
 And I'm the only thing that's runnin' in this city 
 Except for the clouds 
 And man they're comin' down 
 If I knew my way around wouldn't feel so dizzy 
 Where's tele? nobody can tell me 
 I don't speak a lick of that language and got a slippery memory 
 If I spelled it all out on my arm, only if 
 But I didn't so I think get a grip kid, deal with it 
 Baby's waiting for a ring 
 Wont settle for the substitute excuse that's forming 
 I got a complicated case of escapism 
 For her I try to rewire my nature 
 Too tired to wake her up 
 Odder that artificial calm she was on 
 Drug-induced future that slipped out of her palms 
 Seductive rain dancer, she thinks I'm waterproof 
 Like superman doesn't need a roof over his head 
 When I come home to roost I need truth to hold in bed 
 But I'm seeking salvation in a booth 
 And the phones are dead 
 And the lights are out 
 And I'm the only thing livin' in this ghost town 
 Except for the clouds, and man they're comin' down 
 If I knew my way around by now I'd be bound for home 
 Blackout on white night in rome 
 Blackout on white night in rome 
 I know that I'm in love, but I know I'm out of touch 
 And I know that I get dumb when I can sense something's up 
 And then I bottom out 
 European tailspins 
 Scrolling messages out on my pale skin 
 In hopes that they get mailed in 
 Before the ink poisoning takes effect 
 And it gets smudged because I budge before letting paint set 
 I get judged by the ones who have shelter and rain checks 
 While I trudge through the mud 'cause its pouring to rain sweat 
 Regain consciousness and lose common sense 
 The ominous dark skies that lie between me 
 And providence are signs 
 The obvious answer isn't standin on your face with stilettos on 
 If you pop the question wrong 
 Every song's a post afterthought 
 I won't grab the chalk to outline my body of work 
 Toe-tags get caught in my teeth 
 'Cause my foot is in my mouth 
 And spurs are in my words so my tongue can't dismount 
 Even after our rapport had fully run its course 
 Couldn't figure out the most heroic time to jump from the horse 
 And place this old hat for the last time 
 On the coat rack 
 But I donate all of my earnings from this race 
 Just to know that 
 Resisting urges to go back and get it later 
 Like the milk wouldn't sour itself in the refrigerator 
 A wet boy 
 In a dry, dry state 
 On an old country road 
 Where tradition has a blind date 
 I make it dance on its own grave tonight 
 With a change of direction by the pale moon light 
 And if it needs theme music I'll break out the bagpipes 
 And play a tune a ghost wrote me in a past life 
 That goes like... 
 Blackout on white night in rome 
 Blackout on white night in rome 
 Blackout on white night in rome 
 Blackout on white night in rome
