Hi, good evening everyone, 
 Out there in rapper world 
 Sitting at home 
 Next to your stereos 
 With a blank tape and a cassette deck 
 (You want me to do somethin' and then throw it up to you) 
 Massaging the pause button, sure 
 (I'll get you into the mood or whatever) 
 All right, ok 
 As long as I can get rowdy son 
 I have entered 
 This wonderful world of politics 
 Where white collar tricks got me on a proper fix 
 Till they want me to talk about 
 Hollow tips, gonja hits and vodka sips 
 They got sick of topics like the apocalypse 
 So I start to mix lots of sh suggested by outsiders 
 Who should get off on the (?) open their mouths wider 
 I'd rather go down on the vagina of little Kim 
 During her period 
 Then be forced to make a joke of my existence 
 And be a silly kid 
 Who never questions the placement and purpose 
 Of each Egyptian pyramid 
 I'll stick to eccentric epics 
 And construct another Iliad 
 Turn on my television and channel Homer 
 Ward off the evil spirits 
 With some incense and candle aroma 
 That's not as sellable as a vandalist persona 
 So to hell with them 
 I'm a tough guy 
 Watch me crush this can of soda 
 Rrrr tin is putty in my hand 
 I'ma continue to sit over till everybody understands 
 That sincerity is sincerely lacking in show biz 
 Talking about walking a route of evil 
 Giving your ho hivs 
 I'd rather be having you walk the avenue of insight that my flow gives 
 When an MC records records question his motives 
 When a DJ plays that record question his motives 
 See you don't understand 
 I know kids who say they're addicted to sex 
 When in actuality they're addicted to sexual images 
 Masturbating 
 Their brain in intellectual scrimmages 
 Inside of every conceptual lyricist is a thug rapper 
 And in every gun-clapper there is a metaphycisist 
 Heads listen to this knowing there is truth in the sarcasm 
 But who's hearts spasm 
 When they hear us execute arts to the maximum potential 
 Blast an instrumental 
 Find a self professed freestyle king 
 And ask him to get mental 
 Confiscate his writing utensil 
 Dental records link the teeth marks he left biting his pencil to his crab actions 
 Another fraud is identified 
 Now when there are cyphers he is no longer let inside 
 He shall remain an outsider 
 Feel the pain of a pariah 
 If you've got a closed mind 
 Then I'll open your brain wider 
 Say hi to your jock writin counterparts 
 As I rip your town apart 
 With people you consider confidants 
 After my mantra starts 
 Bask in my nonchalance 
 And creates a relaxing ambiance 
 As I drip wax on your body parts 
 The rapture hardly stops 
 I capture hardy's (?) hearts with a spatula 'cause it's probably hot 
 Catapult some ish 
 To Milosavic 
 Till he stops acting like such a bitch 
 Trying to make cultures switch 
 And that'll end the sorrow 
 Inside of Denver Colorado 
 Servin' secrets you do not know 
 ADM spit a hot flow
