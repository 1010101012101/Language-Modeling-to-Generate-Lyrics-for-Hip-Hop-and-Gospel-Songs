(I'm over time) 
 Welcome to my life (welcome) 
 Welcome to my life (welcome) 
 Welcome to my life (welcome) 
 Welcome to my life where everybody wants to cipher 
 They've never held a mic, but they swear they nice, 
 'Cause they boys told 'em so 
 And surely enough they suck my dick in front of they girlfriend like 
 "Look, this is how you do it, you gotta fuckin' do it slow then fast, slow then fast, 
 Eat that shit", check-check 
 If this is you, you're not alone 
 This world's a rock of drones 
 Girls flock like birds 
 'Cause they heard lots of poems from the mystery man 
 When my name gets spit it echoes 
 Straight-laced people say grace with evil smiles 
 I'll stick to Velcro 
 Let go of these claims I hold true 
 This is Sage, don't say I ain't told you 
 Fake gold tooth 
 Real problems with garden gnomes who talk shit 
 My respect's the best bargain known to the consumin' market 
 So pay me it 
 To my love-hate relationship with love-hate relationships 
 Makes me rich 
 My old lady thinks that I done did it 
 But I done didn't 
 Save my breath during dramatic movie endings hold the stub of the ticket 
 When credits roll I'm heading for the exit hole 
 Your track record is such a short shelf-life bless its soul 
 It's about you, all about you 
 That's probably why you don't really respect it or know how to 
 Fuck a fickle fan base, stuck a middle finger in they damn face 
 Does the pinnacle of my hand taste dirty like the suggestive gesture 
 You're best to drop out the school of hard knocks 
 Get murdered by stress and pressure, pressure-cooker 
 I leave the party with a mass amount of assed-out demo tapes to butcher 
 "Could ya give it a little bit of a listen, bro?" 
 Into - "do me a favor and play it on a big system though" 
 Into - "give me a detailed critique of my hot shit" 
 "Sure thing boss, I'll get right on it" 
 Oh hell no he didn't, oh yes he done did my friend 
 Think he was so very special among the hundred thousand 
 You play the fence, your flow is weak and your concepts suck 
 It makes no sense, slow to speak - your logic's fucked 
 You made no dents over beats that got lots of cuts 
 Noise you do have toys like you stocked with Tonka Trunks 
 You're not a lone, this world's a rock of drones 
 Who rock microphones and abuse generous ears 
 With the "yeah, yeah ... off the dome" 
 You're not a lone, this world is stocked with clones 
 And my dear Watson's are coming to bite a style near you 
 You best for sure lock your homes 
 You best for sure lock your homes 
 You best for sure lock your homes 
 You best for sure lock your homes and beware, 
 Beware the garden gnomes.
