Day one I played with her blood 
 Day two left her face bruised and we called it making love 
 Day three her blood played with me 
 Dirty talk caught me off guard 
 She had the nerve to ask if I thought she was crazy 
 Baby, you don't know where my mind has been 
 Fell off the bike more than twice 
 But it's time to ride again 
 This time I learned from my past falls 
 Old wounds may re-open soon 
 Burn 'em in alcohol 
 I heard that last call 
 It was a close one 
 Road runners 
 Know which direction to go when snow comes 
 We're coasting 
 With extra traction on radial tires 
 Having sex in the back wrapped in radio wires 
 Self abusive, Stuck in a bad place 
 A Head full of bruises and scratched face 
 I bled profusely 
 Stirred in my juices 
 So you could taste me 
 Put my neck in a noose 
 And swung to safety 
 Found a land mine planted in the sole of my foot 
 I can't find santcum in the holes I've been put 
 I keep digging 
 Covered in earth 
 I undress 
 They run tests 
 I leave the dirt to the experts 
 White coats and shiny objects 
 I jump their lifeboat science project 
 We got a floater 
 Guinea pig overboard 
 Stone sober hillbilly kid with open sores 
 And ripped vocal chords 
 Tearing them out 
 It's a mute manifesto that you'll probably never hear about 
 Weirded out about my wearabouts 
 Swears pierce my mouth 
 A bearded medicine man who wears a pouch 
 Keeps digging 
 I'm swimming uphill 
 Fighting the tide of mudslides and blood spill 
 Until I've got a shirt off my back 
 And a girl on attack On top With a curled lip 
 The world map is our bedsheet 
 We share geography now 
 I explore virgin territory 
 The squeaky swat acted as a mating call 
 Had Nothing on me but her 
 And didn't feel naked at all 
 Ever feel the need 
 To keep it so real you feed 
 Yourself into her hunger and don't care if she bleeds 
 Asking all these questions 
 Isn't highly recommended 
 They'll eventually get answered 
 If you put time into friendship 
 That's assuming that what you're doing is helping 
 And it's not like you'll know until you uh 
 Reach the ending 
 She wanted my 
 Agony agony agony 
 In her body 
 Day one I played with her blood 
 Day two left her face bruised and we called it making love 
 Day three her blood played with me 
 Dirty talk caught me off guard 
 She had the nerve to ask if I thought she was crazy 
 She was crazy 
 I need more holes to breathe from 
 Went under the knife 
 And contemplated freedom 
 Put it all out on the operating table 
 Clutching onto rubber ducks 
 I played double dutch with some jumper cables 
 Then I broke like the water 
 It started rushing 
 All of a sudden 
 There she was... gone 
 I'm the fall guy 
 She's the sight for sore eyes 
 I'm in labor all night until a new day is born 
 Her globe rotates like eyes roll dice 
 Earth pulls a 180 
 When I look into her snake eyes 
 I'm not afraid of dying 
 Pieces of me die all the time 
 I keep digging (I keep digging) 
 I leave the dirt to the experts 
 Who push the boundaries of pleasure till the sex hurts 
 I hold today with a death grip 
 And play hard to get with tomorrow 
 So as not to look so fucking desperate 
 Face sweaty 
 Hands unsteady 
 Blood pressure off the charts 
 My heart hangs heavy 
 Untreated wounds 
 Through repeated moons are seeds soon 
 To develop in your needy womb 
 A feeble, ill cocoon 
 I don't grieve for many people 
 I don't mourn the pieces killed in you 
 My injection must have been lethal 
 Pick up the shovel love 
 You got some digging to do 
 Agony agony agony 
 (x4) 
 She wanted my 
 Agony agony agony 
 Repeats as sage says the following: 
 Day one I played with her blood 
 Day two left her face bruised and we called it making love 
 Day three her blood played with me 
 Dirty talk caught me off guard 
 She had the nerve to ask if I thought she was crazy
