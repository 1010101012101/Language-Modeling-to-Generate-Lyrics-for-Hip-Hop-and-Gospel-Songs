Then one day it all dawned on me yo 
 I wasn't down with the mainstream or should I say their team 
 (Easier said than done) 
 I wasn't down with the mainstream or should I say their team 
 (Gotta find a way) 
 I wasn't down with the mainstream or should I say their team 
 (Easier said than done) 
 I wasn't down with the mainstream or should I say their team 
 (Gotta find a way) 
 Waste away 
 Sad to see you go the way that you do 
 Today you're through with yesterday's truth 
 You know better for the forward actions 
 As for your past friends, all lost in the holocaust 
 Of thoughts in a backward caption 
 Unlucrative talents that used to give balance when you had to live with two abusive parents 
 Waste away create expenses for yourself 
 I know you're sensitive for the negative effects felt day to day 
 Cash in between your weekly pay checks 
 Remember when you were free? 
 I seen you at your apex 
 Don't tell me you're in a better place just 'cause the rent is higher 
 Spent fuel on retirement now you don't know where the fire went 
 Waste away, the future is charcoal 
 Everything you make is reduced to a barcode 
 Everyone mistakes, pain do's is a lost road 
 Going place to place faking moves on your car's sold 
 Going gold with a fool's heart? 
 I'd rather be a fool with a heart of gold 
 Lose my breaks and save my truth till tomorrow 
 Remember when I'd hate if my beautiful scar showed? 
 The lowest common denominators let the arts suffer 
 The only heart you follow is road kill on your car bumper 
 You're Archie Bunker caught in slumber? 
 I hope you burn to death with the trends that are hot this summer 
 You need to hold the breath you're talking under 
 Until you're close to death and no one's left in the pop culture you cocksucker 
 Freedom to choose between margarine and butter 
 The choice should be between fingernail clippers and lock cutters 
 A little something for the sweet tooth of chocolate lovers 
 Besides candy rappers reproducing 2Pac covers 
 Biggie Small wonders... makin' milk from robotic gutters 
 The whole motherfucking pop culture is smothered 
 Back in the day, NWA made cops shudder 
 And 808's replaced rock drummers 
 Turn them into job hunters 
 Foundation crop dusters 
 You were chillin' now you sound faker than Raekwon's stutter 
 Your whole essence is a stocking stuffer 
 On Christmas Day I'll open your presents with a box cutter 
 Give away secrets to the keys of life 
 While I strike these chords I'm ignored while I counter-points Bill O'Rielly tries to score 
 Wipe the floor with your psyche some more 
 And fight the war with Michael Moore in a Nike store 
 Battling the general consensus of shit 
 As petty as it is Das EFX rocked that band aid ten years before Nelly did 
 I don't wanna be famous like the artists on your playlist 
 The more emotion I put into it the harder they diss 
 Actors with scripts thinking they ought to repent 
 I'd rather be rich than have a whole lot of resent 
 It's the pitiful public I get rush from 
 While I'm busting dope lines I'm misquoted 
 And you might think I wrote it 
 For all you know it's all for the dough 
 I fought off a forty O 
 And bought the clothes that were affordable 
 A scorpio with the stinger sticking into singers and tawdry holes 
 Your chorus flows with an awful show of raw audio 
 They call me slow to adapt, I said F**K THAT!
