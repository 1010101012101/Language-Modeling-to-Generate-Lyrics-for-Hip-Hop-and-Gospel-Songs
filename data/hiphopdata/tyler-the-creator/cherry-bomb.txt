I really made this song just so I could perform it 
 I don't even know how to perform it 
 Aww, nah, boy don't cut that wood 
 Found out your flowers don't smell that good? 
 But if they smell real good to him 
 Then he don't need anybody else nose to win 
 Look, I am a god, nobody pray to sight of you 
 All y'all niggas wear camouflage 
 I'm in a field wearing pink and blue 
 I wear pink they can see me 
 Nigga you don't create you just repeat 
 Nigga you don't got drive you just beep beep 
 Beep Beep talk shit from the backseat 
 Come and light my fire 
 I'll blow your fucking face off 
 Nigga I'm the got damn pilot 
 And I decide when we gone take off (let's get it) 
 Tie the knot 
 Kick the chair 
 Float in the air 
 That's cherry bomb 
 You motherfuckas want war 
 Then come get it 
 You motherfuckas want war and I want more 
 Nigga fuck you and everything that you come for 
 You motherfuckas wanna blow? Then let's take 'em to the gun store 
 I don't got enough time 
 Fuck your Rolex nigga 
 Don't compare him to mine 'cause I don't know that nigga 
 Come and light my fire 
 I'll blow your fucking face off 
 Nigga I'm the got damn pilot 
 And I decide when we gone take off, let's get it 
 Tie the knot 
 Kick the chair 
 Float in the air 
 It's cherry bomb 
 You motherfuckas want war?! 
 Fuck that light this that Cherry Bomb 
 Fuck that light this that Cherry Bomb 
 Fuck that light this that Cherry Bomb 
 Fuck that light this that Cherry Bomb 
 Fuck that light this that Cherry Bomb 
 Fuck that light this that Cherry Bomb 
 Fuck that light this that Cherry Bomb 
 Fuck that light this that Cherry Bomb 
 Fuck that light this that Cherry Bomb 
 Fuck that light this that Cherry Bomb 
 Fuck that light this that Cherry Bomb 
 Fuck that light this that Cherry Bomb 
 Firecracker and I'm ready to blow 
 Don't fire me up 
 I lose control 
 Firecracker and I'm ready to blow 
 Don't fire me up 
 I lose control 
 Firecracker and I'm ready to blow 
 Don't fire me up 
 I lose control 
 Firecracker and I'm ready to blow 
 Don't fire me up 
 I lose control 
 Firecracker and I'm ready to blow 
 Don't fire me up 
 I lose control 
 Don't fire me up 
 I lose control 
 Don't fire me up 
 I lose control 
 Don't fire me up 
 I lose control 
 Firecracker, firecracker, firecracker
