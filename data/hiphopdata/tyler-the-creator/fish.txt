Slip it in her drink 
 And in the blink of an eye I can make a white girl look chink 
 Don't know what to think 
 Cause last time I attempted this shit the judge ordered 
 Me to see a shrink 
 Started with a link 
 Intended her to meet me at the local 
 Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink 
 We be uniquely in sync 
 Already fucking and we only met last week 
 We're both young, not yet antique 
 So her mindset was working for my technique 
 Tell her that I love her and by next week 
 You can hear her shriek from the gas in her cheeks 
 Well, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a Greek that 
 Neighbors by the creek say that my house stinks 
 It reeks of a street girl 
 Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink 
 Oblivion makes obvious seats which 
 Makes me swing my obvious feet 
 We get caught up, go splat, and we think 
 Now I get daughters and time in the clink 
 Got my dick harder than iron and zinc 
 Now they just ride up, mine's caught in the sink 
 Yeah they get cut up, two cent, my physique 
 Critique my shit 
 Wolf Gang (repeat) 
 Bitches running round down pussy take a trip 
 Make you strip, got my dick harder than the unzipped 
 Tyler Swift-ly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's 
 Slit, Round trip in that pussy, here comes a tick- 
 -Et, Them clips poppin' on the cat, bustin' 
 Odd mind cannons on the pill 
 Is he real? Gaza stripping 
 In my living room, Wolf Gang threw who? 
 I'm assuming mushrooms, I'm a necrolampoon 
 Not of Charles Mansoon, this fuck 
 Is ending soon, because I'm ejaculating
