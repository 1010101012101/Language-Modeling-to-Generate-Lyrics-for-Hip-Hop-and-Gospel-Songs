Yeah, I don't want to play you, I just want to tape you undressing 
 And then I'll lay you down and record soft porn 
 If it's romance then it's hardcore, if it's horror 
 Pop the pop corn, the thoughts to rape you really turns me on 
 Press my buttons baby, press my fucking buttons baby 
 Press my buttons baby, yeah 
 Press my buttons baby, press my fucking buttons baby 
 Press my buttons baby 
 You're my favorite show, any chance I get I try to watch 
 Die hard fan can't stop with the tapings 
 Sort of like a psycho when I can't stop with the rapings 
 Of the VHS especially during sex baby 
 Press my buttons baby, press my fucking buttons baby 
 Press my buttons baby, yeah 
 Press my buttons baby, press my fucking buttons baby 
 Press my buttons baby 
 Ready to watch? I'm a slip it in the tape deck 
 But put it in slow-mo, I don't want to bust the tape yet, press play 
 Now this is what I call an evening 
 A live show, almost equivalent to the screening 
 Your dream movie? I'm the clearest copy 
 Now time for Blow, I'm Johnny deep with the rarest poppy 
 Snort a little, now you're getting groovy 
 'Cause I'll kill if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch 
 Press my buttons baby, press my fucking buttons baby 
 Press my buttons baby, yeah 
 Press my buttons baby, press my fucking buttons baby 
 Press my buttons baby, yeah 
 Press my buttons baby, press my fucking buttons baby 
 Press it, stop 
 Danielle, Danielle, yeah you heard about Raquel 
 Well that didn't go well, let us try to make it swell 
 Put the beaver in the mail, we can take it slow like snail 
 Lock my heart up, this is jail, throw away the key 
 Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you? 
 I want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um 
 We can kick it on the couch, blunt you can roll it up 
 But I'm on some shrooms if you really want to feel the room 
 I just want to kick it, kick it for the rest 
 I skated all day, I just need some rest and your breasts 
 Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you? 
 I want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um 
 We can count the stars on the hood of your father's car 
 He's a buster anyway, I can take him any day 
 Look into your eyes I realize that I like you so much 
 That was corny, now I'm horny, can I have a kiss? 
 Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you? 
 I want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um 
 We both teenagers with the same mind state 
 How about some ice cream and some South Park for this first date? 
 Your cat is waiting for that raw fish I can't wait, get it? 
 Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you? 
 I want to feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um
