Got all the black bitches mad cause my main bitch vanilla 
 She trying to get her groove back like Stella, grab the umbrella 
 When it comes to your perception of my shit I'm Helen Keller 
 When it comes to the perfection of my shit I know you 
 Smell the rectum I'm like a chromosome I always X them 
 Like Wolverine steps in attacking a deadly weapon 
 I'm opening a church to sell coke and Led Zeppelin, 
 And f-ck Mary in her ass... ha ha... yo 
 I'm fucking Goldilocks up in the forest 
 In the three bear house eating their motherf-cking porridge 
 I tell her it's my house, give her a tour 
 In my basement, and keep that bitch locked up in my storage 
 Rape her and record it, then edit it with more shit 
 Octopussy special effect, the wet bitches be banging 
 And please never disrespect my set with cannons 
 Hanging from my neck like it's a motherf-cking circus 
 You little n-ggas better check my French 
 You getting money better check my French 
 Ah, what time is it, huh? Check my French 
 If you cop my shit you better check my French, 
 Motherf-cker 
 I make it move check my French 
 I speak English but check my French 
 Your hoe be on my penis she check my French, bitch 
 I guess I left my dick nitty up in the cupboard 
 Cause every girl I'm digging, when I'm digging in her pussy 
 I'm never using a rubber 
 But fuck it I guess I gotta steach it out like it was flubber 
 And leave it drippin green and red like it was devil cheese buggers 
 Chewin on cum like bubble gum from hubbard 
 This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shimp 
 (Laughing) 
 Yo I'm seventeen, already sniffin blow 
 I tell my friends its asthmary time I itch my throat 
 I got a new show for MTV, "Pimp My Boat" 
 Cause some bitch said my semen was dirty, that's silly ho 
 The most that they can do is find me, I'm hiding 
 Somewhere where Christians can't find me 
 Oh no Mister Stokes I don't like misters no 
 Don't tell R. Kelly where my sister goes 
 You little niggas better check my French 
 You getting money better check my French 
 Ah, what time is it, huh? Check my French 
 If you cop my shit you better check my French, muthafucka 
 I make it move check my French 
 I speak English but check my French 
 Your hoe be on my penis she check my French, bitch 
 Yo you little niggas better check my French 
 I got allstars and you can check my bench 
 Left Brain super three, Creator Ace puttin' the expressions in music and create the face 
 Of the picture, punchline figured out ah I get you 
 No you don't nigga so why don't you go figure 
 You seem confused anyway, pressure enough? 
 You the type to do the choke when the pressure is up 
 The pressure is to pump and pressure is us 
 Bitches havin' eargasms and the pleasure is us 
 Niggas wanna B.O.F. and write letters to us 
 Competition's competition, yo you better than us? 
 Digest what I'm sayin'? I don't think so 
 We sick shit, throw it up down in the sink yo 
 The odd niggas are beginning to spill these pink hoes 
 We think sorta odd so we think so 
 Crusin in my go kart at walmart sellin cupcakes 
 Go ahead admit it faggot this shit is tighter then buttrape 
 That evolves Ballpark franks and silver duct tape 
 Pornos and hormones and boxes of DiGiornos 
 You homos is loco your prolly drinking cuervo 
 With some vatos with the door closed watchin zorro you homos
