I don't wanna play you, I just wanna tape you undress 
 And then I'll lay you down and record soft porn 
 If it's romance then it's hardcore, if it's horror 
 Pop the pop corn, the thought to rape you really turns me on 
 Press my buttons baby 
 You're my favorite show, any chance I get I try to watch 
 Die hard fan, can't stop with the tapings 
 Sorta like a psycho when I can't stop with the raping 
 Of the VHS especially during sex baby 
 Ready to watch? I'mma slip it in the tape deck 
 But put it in slowmo, I don't wanna bust the tape yet, press play 
 Now this is what I call an evening 
 A live show, almost equivalent to screening 
 You're dream movie? I'm the clearest copy 
 Now time for Blow, I'm Johnny deep with the rarest poppy 
 Snort a little, now you're getting groovy 
 'Cause I'll kill if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch
