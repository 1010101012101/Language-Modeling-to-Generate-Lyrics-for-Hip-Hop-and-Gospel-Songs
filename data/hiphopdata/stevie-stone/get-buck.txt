Better brace yourself for the second coming 
 Got to clear that, it's the baggage now I'm up and running 
 Did you hear that, can you feel that? 
 The static 'cause I finally done it 
 Spread a little bit of magic 
 On them chocolate bunnie (buns), I get it in! 
 Bitch Stone don't pay no more 
 Don't never not get paid no more 
 Say what you really wanna say 
 You niggas wanna hate but you really can't hate no more 
 Don't never knock on stage no more 
 Strange music dipped in butter 
 Different faces colored 
 Could have been alot of others 
 Repping in my crooked letter (crooked letter)

 Spreadin with my feet together clip together 
 (Got my shit together) yeah I got my shit together!

 Stepped out, hoped out the back seat 
 ??? Stay back, feed it to tha bat 
 Hold the turf, reppin lately 
 Been in my zone here, lately 
 ? Break another wall hear lately 
 I'mma get up in that ass 
 In the middle with a map 
 Of the MO and I'm way to? 
 Cravin bitches is crazy 
 Motherfuckers got crazy 
 Nigass wanna get up in the feelings 
 I'm surrounded by their ladies 
 Whatchya sayin', whatchya sayin' 
 (What you sayin' boy) 
 Haters think we play, think we playin' 
 (Playin', huh?) 
 ?? Cry to rock it 
 Got that burner in my pocket 
 In case you niggas wanna stop it
