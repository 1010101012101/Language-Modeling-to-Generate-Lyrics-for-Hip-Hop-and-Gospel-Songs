Bitch I'm out and rollin'

 Bend to my aroma 
 Strange on the linen!uhuh!) 
 Bitch I'm out and rollin' 
 808 bendin' (yupp!) 
 Bend to my aroma (huh!) 
 Strange on the linen 
 Bitch I'm out and rollin' 
 Ya, bitch I'm out and rollin' 
 Bitch I'm out and rollin' 
 Ya, bitch I'm out and rollin' 
 Bitch I'm out and rollin' 
 Ya, bitch I'm out and rollin' (uhuh) (Tell 'em!) 
 Bitch I'm out and rollin' (Himmi!) 
 Strange on the linen 
 Ah, no, no, I say the projects says 
 We on that Himmi Hyme 
 They got me on the deck 
 There's money on the line 
 Got 'em all reciting my rhymes 
 Blowing on the keesha 
 Channelin' my topics 
 All around the region (region, region, region, region) 
 It's a wrap, wrap, wrap 
 Got that shit that'll get 'em in the whips 
 And bring 'em back, back, back 
 Said I'm ridin' mine 
 All up and down the county line 
 You and niggas that strategize 
 Fuck you if I'm outta line 
 (Bitch I'm rollin', rollin') 
 Rap game, my chain, I get em' nigga 
 (Go) Back down, not a ne'er nigga fuckin' wit' her 
 (Go) Runnin' miles on 'em 
 Left till is a product wit' her 
 (Go) Got a model bitch 
 Form another island, y'all 
 (Go) (I'm in the game!) 
 Foot work pops 
 Mouth piece problems 
 Saint Black diamonds 
 Off the meter, tryin' to stay honest 
 But compare me to the greatest bein' modest 
 Bitch I'm rollin' 
 My name is Aaron 
 I'm no fair an' 
 Your sister's starin' 
 She's in love 
 'Cause my 808's bendin' 
 Benzo wheels spinnin' 
 Put a chick at the wheel 
 And a lick to my grill 
 Man, I'm aimin' straight grinnin' 
 You smell Hugh Parsons 
 When I pass you bitch you barkin' 
 Like a dog when he see a true Martian 
 Who's sparkin' new jargon 
 Sorry N Scheisse 
 But your ladys really beautiful eyes'a 
 Looking at me like she wanna bigger size brah 
 Don't stifle her, let me slice her 
 Look at Nina go, evident in the industry with a finger to the foe 
 When all my enemies, they sentimentally they growin' 
 To women, when I spit 'em, 'cause I'm a cold nigga' roll 
 Ah, ha, ha, ha 
 Me and my Strangers rolling 
 Drinkin' lots of Vodka 
 That's the ca-ca 
 You know I can't sang without a guitar strang 
 Rollin' around town, nigga', bumpin Lil' Wayne 
 Everybody knowin' that we in the same gang 
 Gettin' good brain and I can't maintain 
 Great spending time with Stone, this Yate's ending 
 Now picture us rollin' 
 With our 808's bendin'
