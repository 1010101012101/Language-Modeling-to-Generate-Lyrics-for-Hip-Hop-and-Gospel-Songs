Stranger 
 (Strange, strange, strange) 
 Stranger, stranger 
 (Strange. strange, strange) 
 Told 'em I'm a stranger 
 Some o' them tried to hold me down 
 Other people said that I was crazy 
 Been lookin' to get my feet off the ground 
 Now, I told 'em I'm a stranger 
 Yeah, I'm a stranger 
 (Strange, strange, strange) 
 Say, I'm the perfect stranger 
 Yeah I'm a stranger, now 
 Told 'em I'm a stranger 
 You can look into my eyes 
 See a stranger in the flesh and no surprise 
 I was destined to it 
 And the fans knew it 
 And the fam knew it 
 That one day we would coencide 
 Make beautiful music 
 Now we off and climbin 
 Started at the ? and stars aligned 
 And perfect timin', 'leven years later 
 Now together, rhymin' 
 Really could feel it when the headlines read 
 Strange met stone 
 When they asked me how I feel, I said I'm finally home 
 'Member the day it came to me 
 The feeling I felt okay to be 
 On ??? 
 All you strangers start embracin' me 
 ? Every word you heard me say 
 Midwest 'splotion came to play 
 Everythin' happens for a reason 
 I can finally say 
 Stranger 
 Some o' them tried to hold me down 
 Other people said that I was crazy 
 Been lookin' to get my feet off the ground 
 Now, I told 'em I'm a stranger 
 Yeah, I'm a stranger 
 (Strange, strange, strange) 
 Say, I'm the perfect stranger 
 Yeah I'm a stranger, now 
 Told 'em I'm a stranger 
 Different place, different time 
 This point in my career in a different state of mind 
 And I upon this ladder climb 
 Getting all these strangers side 
 Spit flame ? reply? 
 In time, I rise 
 Destined I've invisioned the stardom 
 No status can justify ? if I got 'em? 
 ?? From the ? bottom 
 To the strangers, it's bottom 
 No I won't be enforcin the game 
 That ? a problem, holla 
 Now, all you ? can ? it easy 
 Plottin up on my? 
 Fall back when didn't really believe me 
 (And can't none of you haters hold me 
 And I'm ridin' with my homies 
 You gonna have to get to know me 
 I'm a)
