When I hit the stage, music become my remedy 
 All of my problems fade away-ay 
 La, la, la;la, la, la 
 Soon as I hit the stage, music become my remedy 
 All of my problems fade away-ay 
 Yo, another day, another dolla 
 Need more than ? commas? 
 Hope it's better tomorrow 
 More money ? brain, mo' drama 
 The things I did, forgive me heavenly father 
 It was necessary 
 Responsibility, kids to feed 
 No more chance in penitentiary 
 And me, away from my kids, it can never be 
 This is when music became my remedy 
 Horns reign? 
 Isolated myself in a daze 
 Beautiful musical melodies, floatin' through my veins 
 ? Is gone when I'm jottin' all the things that I can say 
 I'm lost in the moment today my problems fade away 
 Something about the way it make the kid feel? 
 Hittin' on paper with a pen has gotten me a deal 
 But still, I will, tour and travel to the hills 
 On stage never find me I stand still 
 And the chorus sang 
 When I hit the stage, music become my remedy 
 All of my problems fade away-ay 
 La, la, la;la, la, la 
 Soon as I hit the stage, music become my remedy 
 All of my problems fade away-ay

 They ? to God I came out 
 Didn't take the main route
