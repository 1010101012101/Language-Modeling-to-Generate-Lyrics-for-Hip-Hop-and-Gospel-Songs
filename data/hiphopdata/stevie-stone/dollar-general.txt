This here was all in a dream, everything's getting complicated 
 As it would have seemed, niggas was stressed out 
 The whips do a couple of check bounce 
 I was looking for something to test out 
 Criminal, I don't usually want the style but now 
 Circumstances have got me on prowl [?] 
 Up in the late night, you can check the shit out 
 And when I see the bait bite, voices were saying to me 
 Let's go rob the dollar, general 
 Get the benjamins, and the penny rolls 
 Grab the panty hose, I'm a criminal 
 Guess I'm a criminal 
 Let's go rob the dollar, general 
 Get the benjamins, and the penny rolls 
 Grab the panty hose, I'm a criminal 
 Guess I'm a criminal 
 Here's the plan 
 Learned about this daisy, go for my man 
 Tonight is the night, strategizing and apprehend 
 We'll never get the chance to do this again 
 Know what I'm saying? 
 You get up in the alley round 3 o'clock 
 Of tops, cut the surveillance then we in the spot 
 Scan the cops so can stand out 
 Know the room but not exactly where's whereabouts 
 Hope you're ready 
 Lay back and watch for the signal 
 Brought the proper tools so I can go through the window 
 [?] First, I see a way through the ceiling 
 It could be a west wing of the building 
 Boom, we in and we're fucking the shit here up 
 Looking through [?] and covers [?] up 
 I got it, let's go, hope that this dream is a hope 
 They got me mafiatized, I think I've gotten too close 
 I'm living on their [?] 
 Let's go rob the dollar, general 
 Get the benjamins, and the penny rolls 
 Grab the panty hose, I'm a criminal 
 Guess I'm a criminal 
 Let's go rob the dollar, general 
 Get the benjamins, and the penny rolls 
 Grab the panty hose, I'm a criminal 
 Guess I'm a criminal, now 
 This was a tight fit, 
 [?] Out, in this comfort, for the biggest heist shit 
 Hear the beat, the last hit, before retiring 
 In and out, the loot sirens 
 Go to time the street 43, the plan had go [?] leaves 
 And we, we was sitting quietly, 
 Silently, [?] leave it, do it probably 
 She gone, we [?] all way, over to the stairs 
 Straight up the control room with the cameras everywhere 
 Grab a [?] making them all disappear 
 The room with the safe [?] sitting right there, yeah 
 This time I'm [?] up the wall 
 This safe is a beast, but I brought my biggest saw 
 A couple hours, the [?] deep, got home a [?] and seven G 
 Let's go rob the dollar, general 
 Get the benjamins, and the penny rolls 
 Grab the panty hose, I'm a criminal

 Grab the panty hose, I'm a criminal
