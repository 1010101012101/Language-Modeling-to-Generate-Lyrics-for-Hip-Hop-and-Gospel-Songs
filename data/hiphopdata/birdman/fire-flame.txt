 Lil Wayne 
 Fresh out from my bid 
 Bitch it's Lil Tuneche 
 I Lucille Ball, bitch I love Lucy 
 If these niggas dogs, I'm animal cruelty 
 Don't fuck with me at all, 'cause I'm twisted like an Rubiks cube 
 Oh my, look how the time has flown 
 And they say time is of the essence 
 But what if there clock is wrong 
 But all my problems will be second 
 And all my worries will be gone 
 And I'll have money back for breakfast smell like "bitch I'm rich cologne" 
 Ha, I'm so relaxed my Gucci flats ain't got a scratch 
 If you got a problem with I, well I will fix them, cataracts 
 They say it cost to be the boss 
 I paid the price including tax 
 Bitch I'm a fire flame spitter 
 And to me you niggas wax 
 (What ya talking bout)
