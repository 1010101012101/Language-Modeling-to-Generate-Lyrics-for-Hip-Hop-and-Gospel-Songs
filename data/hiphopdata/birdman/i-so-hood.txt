 This the remix 
 The I'm so hood remix 
 I'm making movies 
 (T-Pain) 
 I'm so Hood 
 Remix 
 Yeah, I where my pants below my waist (we always gonna be the best) 
 And I never dance when I'm in this place 
 Because you and your man is planning to hate (I run this man) 
 I'm so hood 
 And I got these gold up in my mouth 
 If you get closer to my house 
 Then you'll know what I'm talking about (I make hit records this is what I do) 
 (I'm of the) hood (This the remix) 
 And if you feel me put your hands up Hood (put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up) 
 My hood niggas can you feel me (I gave you we taking over) 
 I'm so hood 
 And It you're not from here you can walk it out 
 If You don't know what I'm talking about 
 I'm so Hood (hey young jeezy) 
 (You got me we run this man we run this) 
 (Verse 1 (Young Jeezy)) 
 I'm so h to the double-o d 
 Got all this god damn money on me 
 Pockets so fat it don't make no sense 
 Whips so clean don't need no tints 
 Watch so bright I don't need no light 
 And no where word don't need no mic 
 Niggas like Young what you get for show? 
 Tell 'em same shit I used to get for the blow 
 Send on 'em on the road nigga what I got to lose 
 Put 'em in the vans I ain't talkin' about the shoes 
 Do the speed limit nigga watch out for the lights 
 Pussy ass niggas gotta watch out for the dikes 
 Seventeen five yeah nigga I said it 
 Seventeen five yeah nigga yeah I meant it 
 And when we do it bad and when we do it good 
 I'm so I'm so I'm so mother fucking hood 
 (Verse 2 (Ludacris)) 
 Everybody come equipped with bangas 
 Throwing up our middle fangas 
 And you know I don't slip so I gotta keep 10 in the clip and 1 the chambers 
 Better be walking with angels 
 And never take candy from strangers 
 Luda's dressed in stripes had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals 
 I'm in the zone homes going for the two point conversion 
 I'm so hood that Ludacris should have been on the original version 
 But this is the remix 
 With the cheap tricks 
 Hitting sweet licks 
 And I cut the braids off with the waves and the fade that will make you sea sick 
 See this is the way that we ball 
 And this is the way we roll 
 So put a fist in the air if you care 
 United we stand and divided we fall 
 When the south is in the house you better watch your mouth 
 'Cause we on that hood shit I'm hood rich 
 Coming around your hood bitch 
 I swear I'm so... 
 (Chorus T-Pain (Busta Rhymes)) 
 I'm so hood (remix) 
 And if you feel me put your hands up 
 Hood 
 My hood niggas can you stand up 
 (I'm so hood) 
 And if you ain't from here you can walk it out (the king of the streets and the gods of the 
 Hood) 
 You ain't hood if you don't know what I'm talking about (Busta bust bitches) 
 I'm so hood 
 (Verse 3 Busta Rhymes) 
 See all I know is that I got to get my money 
 Again and again 
 Top down 
 Let the money blow in the wind 
 With bad bitch sitting in the passenger seat 
 Where the do be wrapped head full of bobby pins 
 You know I keep the thing when I walk 
 See the dialect 
 Different from the slang of my talk 
 Baby still living got a crack in front of another bad bitch that will 
 Boost for the spot 
 I'm used to leaving the strip last 
 Hustling until the sun comes up getting cash 
 So much bread in all of my coat pockets 
 It looks like a nigga got hips with an ass 
 And from the DNA in my blood 
 Niggas idolize me and 
 Try to do what I does 
 And if the other nigga ain't really from the hood 
 You can easily die 
 Tell who that fake nigga was (Hood) 
 And even though I split a little rap 
 Got Niggas in the hood trying to sell the most crack 
 Violator, I send a nigga to do it just to make you spend a lot of money just to get your shit 
 Back 
 You all niggas know where I'm from 
 And I rep it to the fullest until the day that I'm done 
 So hood where we live where my niggas sold drugs and they rich 
 And my niggas ride in the sun 
 (Verse 4 (Big Boi)) 
 Fatty Fat Fat 
 So hood like the Cadillac 
 On the mint full of my balance 
 Call an ambulance 
 To come and pick his ass up because a nigga never had a chance 
 They try to dance with a devil in the pale moonlight 
 Advance on the level that they can't do right 
 Lay hands on a fellow like the man in blue lights 
 Woop, woop 
 Do it twice 
 You're boy the B - I - G 
 I'm nicer than MC in your top three 
 You cocky? 
 I cock, Squeeze 
 Bust them things not you sloppy 
 Speed it up, slow it down, then screw it 
 Don't bite the flow because I got that blew it 
 Run through the crew or some whole other new shit 
 Newness bitch we do this 
 (Chorus T-Pain (Lil Wayne)) 
 I'm so hood (remix) 
 And if you feel me put your hands up 
 Hood 
 My hood niggas can you feel me I'm so hood 
 And if you ain't from here you can walk it out (up out) 
 You ain't hood if you don't know what I'm talking about (Weezy) 
 I'm so hood 
 (Verse 5 (Lil Wayne)) 
 I'm so Holligrove, New Orleans 
 Lilweezyana 
 Home sweet home depot 
 You will need a hammer 
 It go down like Frasier 
 I ain't talking Kelsey Grammer 
 I be shitting on your boys I need an alka-seltzer sandwich 
 Since I heard Plies I done brought the phantom back 
 Went and got me a 52 inch 
 Maybach 
 I'm eating like a big dog 
 I'm so full, I'm so good 
 I'm so straight, you so fake 
 I'm so real 
 I'm so hood 
 (Verse 6 (Fat Joe)) 
 Yeah nigga 
 Welcome to the crack house 
 I should own a McDonald's 
 The way I bring the mac's out 
 I'm from the hood where every nigga lies 
 Flip a couple grand 
 They tell you the baking pies shit 
 Still got my name carved in that Central Booking 
 Gave that pussy a scar and told her good lookin' 
 You's a crack baby that means your momma paid me 
 You can't even blame me that's what the hood made me 
 (Verse 7 (Baby)) 
 Martin Luther King (MLK) 
 Callio, Magnolia, Melphimine 
 Gettin' that Money with a triple beam 
 See rattle cry your Josephine 
 Saints is my team 
 That's what we breathe nigga 
 That's how we eat 
 Get this money on the streets nigga 
 V L my street blood 
 5 star G blood 
 Fly as a bird 
 Got these eagles on my seat blood 
 Then hit back where I stay 
 Third war we get that cake 
 Thirteen is where I lay 
 Shots out to MIA 
 (Verse 8 (Rick Ross)) 
 More money more problems 
 Don't call me conceited 
 Just call me the boss 
 Always got what you needed 
 M.I.Yayo so hot 
 But my neck got the fever 
 If you sneeze you get shot 
 Gun play make him believe us 
 I just bought me a ranch 
 Watch the hundred stacks 
 No those ain't Rolex diamonds 
 What you done to that? 
 You fools for gazing 
 My fools from Haiti 
 I move some daily 
 It's a movie baby 
 Hood
