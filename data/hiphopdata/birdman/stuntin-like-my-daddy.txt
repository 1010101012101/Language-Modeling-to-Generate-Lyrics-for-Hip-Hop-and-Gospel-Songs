Vroom on a Yamaha chromed out 11 hundred 
 What I'm doin', gettin' money, what we doin', gettin' money 
 What they doin', hatin' on me, but they neva' cross 
 Cash money still the company, and bitch I'm the boss 
 And I be stuntin like my daddy, stuntin like my daddy 
 Stuntin' like my daddy, I be stuntin like my daddy 
 I'm the, young stunna, stuntin like my daddy 
 Stuntin' like my daddy, I be stuntin like my daddy 
 Bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say 
 Can't see my lil' nigga, the money in the way 
 And I'm, I'm sittin' high, a gansta ride blades 
 If you ain't gone ride fly than you might as well hate 
 Shit I gotta eat, even though I ate 
 It ain't my birthday but I got my name on my cake 
 Believe that, if ya man's wanna play 
 I'm a fuck around and put that boy brains on the table 
 So pick 'em up, pop 'em let 'em lay 
 Where I'm from we see a fuckin' dead body everyday 
 That's, uptown, throwin' stuff at 'em 
 Niggas talk about me I'm throwin' shots back at 'em 
 Bitch I'm a pipe, and she like a crack attic 
 And she saw me cookin' eggs and she though I was back at it 
 I grab the keys, hoe I gotta go 
 I got my motorcycle jacket and my motorcycle loafs

 98's, 45 paper plates

 A hundred stacks, spend 50 on a caddy, 25 on the pinky, 
 Bought a pound of blow and bounced back 
 Magic grills, big houses on the hill 
 Got them hoes in the kitchen all cookin' pan meals

 Flippin chickens gettin' tickets nigga meet me after hour 
 Born stunna, uptown hunter

 You now we shine every summer, we grind every summer 
 And this is how we spend money 
 You see them Bentley's and them lambs' 
 Them ounces and them grams, nigga we was born hustlas

 When I was 16 I bought my first Mercedes Benz 
 I must've fucked a thousand bitches and they girlfriends 
 White leather, hot new bare rims, brand new pistol with the trigger like a hair pin 
 Big work, we don't need scale man, big papers say g'mornin' to the mail man 
 What'cha now bout putting bricks in the spare? man, 
 I can stuff a coupe like a muthafucken caravan 
 I'm in my zone my ? is so rare man a ? you lookin' at the chair man 
 How you want it, show me my opponent, show me my opponent 
 I'm still ballin, a bullet gotta get me 
 And I've never been a pussy cause my hood never let me 
 A made nigga got made niggas wit me 
 I'm a motorcycle boy so I'm about to pop a wheelie
