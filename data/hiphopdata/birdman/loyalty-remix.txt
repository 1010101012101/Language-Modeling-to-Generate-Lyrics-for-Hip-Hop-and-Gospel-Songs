(Tyga - Chorus) 
 Uh, Rain snow, get my hustle on 
 Countin' cash every morning before I leave home 
 Family I love, don't wanna leave this world alone 
 And before I leave home, leave home 
 I pray to God I won't, loyalty is all I know 
 Before I leave home 
 I pray to God I won't, loyalty is all I know 
 (Birdman) 
 Yeah, red ribbon duckin fast till we pass out 
 Bird days stop the shine till we let 'em out 
 It's more money now and we the flip the draw 
 Hella choppers, clip pull nigga genue out 
 G'd up, I took it from the G code 
 Presidental sweets, with this cash flow 
 Uptown gangsta, viet hustla 
 Third wall general, Young Cash Money 
 (Brisco) 
 Before I leave home, I kiss my babies 
 Hope I return safetly, knowin' the odds against me 
 These devils, they tryin' to break me 
 I'm still loyal, my habits became lavish 
 Dreams of new 'n' devis 
 Pub deals and known mastives 
 And my home boys, aid my conditions 
 I made ? managers, execs and assistance 
 And most of don't understand, some won't listen 
 We might fall off, four fifts and get messend 
 But your still my dawg and my big homie spawldy 
 And I feel I'm the youngest, he expects a little more from me 
 So I try to stay humbled and as you can see my vision 
 You can see us Cash Money till the mother f-cking ending, Brisco 
 (Tyga - Chorus) 
 (Mack Maine) 
 (YMCMB, baby) 
 So before I leave home, kiss my girl on the cheek 
 And then I say a prayer 
 If looks was bullets I woulda been there from stairs 
 I bypass the elevator and I took the stairs 
 Now that hard work got me ridin' in Bentlys and Les 
 Homie I am so prepared, on point like infared 
 I live my life so to die, I ain't never scared 
 And when I drop, I'm not gon flop, I'm no Andre Ware 
 I can't see you haters, guess my vision is impared 
 My n-ggas already there, yes we'd got that title 
 You other rappers losing, wait... minus the? 
 Breath of fresh air, pump lung, money catscan 
 So Cash Money heart bleed, Young Money, one hunny 
 (Lil' Twist) 
 (Twist... Young Money) 
 Before I leave home, well manner 
 Nice, respectful young man 
 Momma taught me well 
 But Daddy taught me through a jail cell 
 Raised as a prince, n Young Money then took me in 
 Made it official, YM young, n CMB, was happening 
 Yeah, I gotta do it for my hood 
 See before I step off the block I told all them n-ggas I would 
 Let's do it for the OC, I put in work on that TV 
 And step one over a G now put your hands for the lil old me 
 (Tyga - Chorus) 
 (Bow Wow) 
 Chea, stay true to my team 
 YMCMB a-aka the greatest 
 Yeah, that's why they hate us 
 Went from layaway to rocking all the latest, fashion 
 Name a model chick I ain't smashing 
 New cars for all my homies when I bring that cash in 
 Never had my father in my life, he was a dead beat 
 Moms worked two jobs and keep Jordans on my feet 
 Now that I'm on, they set the word bout 
 I bought my momma a mansion, and moved the damn south 
 And watcha talking bout 
 Got my Bugatti on the way Stunna 
 Money coming in fast like the road walk... back 
 (Cory Gunz) 
 Whistle for my family, my label and my set 
 It's Young Money till my day the death, tell the rest to take a rest 
 Theral breaded and blessed, my grime stressed 
 Sometimes get never the less, young 'n' shining with the best 
 I promised my momma one day I'll be a rhymer, she left 
 But I love her so much it's like she never took a step 
 Reality showed me them colors that some of us couldn't 
 Look at you now that we all thought some of us wouldn't 
 He said he gettin' dough right, ready jetty for pole lights 
 Petty better than to roll dice, some cold nights 
 They getting us no life, but I'm here now 
 And we here like, something, nothing compare life 
 CMB, I'm privilege in this legacy that's real life 
 My brothers cupar, protect me from my friends haud 
 My enemies beleza, choking on anestezija 
 Throw my signs high, reconize world wide, world wide 
 I'm in it to get whatever it cost me, it's too noisey...
