(Lil Wayne - Chorus) 
 B-tch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say, 
 Can't see you lil n-ggas, the money in the way, 
 B-tch I'm paid B-tch B-tcha I'm paid, 
 B-tch I'm paid B-tch B-tcha I'm paid, 
 B-tch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say, 
 B-tch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say, 
 B-tch I'm paid B-tch B-tcha I'm paid, 
 B-tch I'm paid B-tch B-tcha I'm paid, 
 (Birdman - Verse) 
 Hardbody cocaine flow dope game never wrote more cane, 
 More to gain more money not a choke smoke... cane, 
 More money blood Mary Jane, 
 Switchin ya lane doing thangs n-gga making change, 
 Fast like a hurry, 
 More money that I ever seen b-tch don't you worry, 
 That's how we breaded uptown soldier, 
 Never did 4 b-tch known how I roll her, 
 The Porsche came wit candy, 
 The money on the line, 
 Hundred g's all the time, 
 N-gga pitch the sunshine, 
 4 dope Cartier old hoe still there, 
 So I brought her to the mall, 
 B-tch! shawty we don't care, 
 Ball till you fall, b-tch she be shinin' hard time, 
 Bought my b-tch a white mink and a matching benz 5, 
 Priceless in the Lambo, Hustlin wit my ammo, 
 Shinin' like a diamond when I jump of out this Lambo, 
 (Birdman - Verse 2) 
 Jump through the lane, Nothing ever change, 
 Got more money so sh-t still the same, 
 More cane n-gga so we never did change,

 Live through the cycle n-gga struggle for the fame, 
 Money came more so we hustle all the time, 
 More that we get N-gga more that we fly, 
 The sunshine came to the moon how we grind, 
 N-gga money now still flippin' all the time, 
 The motor change n-ggas so the watch wit the meter, 
 Cartier face every time that I see her, 
 Chandelier lights to the prices of the dice, 
 Roll a hundred g's n-gga f-ck the same night, 
 Poppin' Don P Red champagne, 
 Alize poppin' more blowin' air, 
 Draggin' that brown n-gga holdin' uptown puttin' it down hold my crown got the game of the ground, 
 That's how we get it, more money on the island, 
 More money by da hour, More muscle wit this power, 
 Climbin more fences, Higher than a light, 
 More money so bright, So we cash it that night, 
 Why another million, Still another ticket, 
 Bought another lambo, bought another building, 
 Flossin all the time, Porsche, Benz, truck, every time I pull up, 
 Somethin' new came up, Flossin with the ice, 
 N-gga priceless wit the life, Give a f-ck about the price, 
 Do the same thing twice, 
 (End)
