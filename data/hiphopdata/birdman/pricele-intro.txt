Just like that 
 (Bird call) 
 The beginning of a new beginning nigga 
 Yeah, life so priceless 
 Look, so priceless 
 Like the family homie 
 Joules came and the money straight ran on me 
 Mama left me as a youngin' so it came homie 
 Street came and the money was the fame homie 
 Cocaine is the fame of the thang homie 
 The dope game got me playin' in the streets homie 
 The dope game brought the chopper and it's feet homie 
 New cars new bras nigga's swag change 
 8 figures from the projects in the mud 
 Blood money nigga's strapped all in the club 
 There's no love in the city we'll snatch the plug 
 The pussy wet so the pussy got a new plug 
 Mo hustlin' mo hustle not uptown 
 Puttin' down world wide nigga gettin' down 
 Flyin' round getting in; youngin' wear the crown 
 Mo money now 
 Nigga shuttin' down 
 Up top get the money 'cause we want it all 
 Break the bank bitch nigga come and watch us ball 
 Fly high 
 Stay nigga so high 
 25 on the candy when we ride 
 Stay fly when I come through we fuck 'em all 
 Buck 'em all when they fuckin' with the big dog 
 Cash shit, 
 Talkin' that fast shit 
 Cash Money Young Money this Priceless (One hundred) 
 Yeah 
 See if you can see me 
 Five thousand on the lens 
 Yeah 
 Birdman 
 Let's go 
 Rock with me 
 Uptown 
 We in the buildin' baby 
 Ocean city view 
 Swagged out 
 Big money partner
