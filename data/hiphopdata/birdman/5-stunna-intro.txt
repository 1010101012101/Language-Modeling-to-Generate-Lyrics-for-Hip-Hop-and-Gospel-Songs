Hey 
 Brian, I'm glad you took some time to come see me finally, you know. 
 You got any more room on your arms for them tattoos there, buddy? 
 Huh? I know a lotta guys in the joint that had them tattoos like that, lucky you're on the outside looking in. 
 But anyway, I'm glad to seeing you do well for yourself, that's great. 
 Junior has been bringing in a lot of money, I like that. I saw you guys on that 
 TV thing, I see you won the "People's 
 Choice" award. 
 We usually don't like to see our guys on 
 TV, but, in your case, I guess, uh, it's a good thing: you have to. 
 So the real reason I made you come up here today was because I wanted to talk about our next move. 
 The money that's coming is great, but now it's time to flip it. 
 We gotta put it back on the schtreets, but we gotta make it clean, you know with the sanitation, a couple of construction jobs, I'm gonna show you and teach you everything. 
 For everybody else this might be hard, but we're gonna make it look easy.
