(Intro - Birdman) 
 Yeah 
 Birdman, always, priceless 
 Cash Money, Young Money 
 New money, swagged out 
 Uptown we in the building 
 (Chorus - Kevin Rudolf) 
 I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, I want it all 
 I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, I want it all 
 I want it all 
 (Verse 1 - Birdman) 
 Ride fly, always on chrome 
 Birds fly, count when we get home 
 Big money in the garbage can 
 New money every time we land 
 Big houses, new cars 
 Uptown, 3rd Ward 
 On the wall with platinum plaques 
 In the club throwing hundred stacks 
 She fly, my kind, and I brought her, inside 
 She saw the marble floors, popping bottles, blowing dro 
 She like just how I live 
 Private jets from Beverly Hills 
 Hundred mills on the platinum floor 
 Hundred mill' my son can glow 
 (Verse 2 - Lil Wayne) 
 I want the world 
 You want the pussy 
 I want the pearl 
 I want the life 
 I want tonight 
 My fruits of labor, I want them ripe 
 That's right, private flight 
 Money gets stacked to the highest height 
 Better get your math and science right 
 But I want the drama, guided light 
 I-I-I want the hype, but I don't believe it 
 I want it all, but I know I don't need it 
 Man, I just want what's cool 
 And I, want, you 
 (Verse 3 - Birdman) 
 Diamond face, hundred on one streak 
 Every day, do it like it's no sleep 
 Around the way, tote because we got heat 
 Hundred G's in the chopper, new fleet 
 No money, never get no time 
 Get money, stay on a nigga mind 
 Priceless, strapped on a nigga street 
 Uptown, YMCMB 
 Got to, get it, fuck, crime, get, money, all the, time 
 Got to, know, about me, Birdman, O.G. 
 Harley Davis pull up to the sun shine 
 Tattoos, bloodline on mine 
 Billionaires, that's what it's about nigga 
 Billionaires, we get loud nigga
