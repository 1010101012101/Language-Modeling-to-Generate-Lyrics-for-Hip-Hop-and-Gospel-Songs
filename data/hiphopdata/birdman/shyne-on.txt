Yeah, we gon go old school, ya know what I'm sayin' 
 If you from where I'm from, ya know what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 The way we do this here this is a cash money classic 
 And I feel couldn't nobody do it the way I'ma do it 
 Ya know what I'm sayin' so, here we go world 
 I'm bringin' it to your world from my world 
 Ya know what I'm talkin' 'bout look I say 
 Get your shine on, get your shine on

 In one you trust, the neighborhood is us 
 And everything that I ride is 22s and up 
 And every time that I slide, you know I'm platinum plus 
 Make the hood understand that we tryin' to come up 
 24s on trucks, just the neighborhood lust 
 Tell Lil' One, be cool everybody comin' up 
 'Cause everybody wanna ride, everybody wanna shine 
 So how ya love that people? Everybody on the grind 
 And these projects cuts ya hood rich livin' lavish 
 Those 14s, you know we had to have it 
 Once upon a time it was nothin' but madness 
 Hustlin' right in front of my mama, Ms. Gladys 
 Chasin' paper, paper chasin', look that's all we know 
 Comin' through the neighborhood on them 24s 
 Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand, nigga up it some more 
 Fast money, cash money, that's all I know, one

 They say, I walk around like I got an S on my chest 
 That be that cash money piece, flow rest in the deck 
 I'ma specially set, no testin' the best 
 I'll be in class, no pencil, no test on the desk 
 I'll make ya mouthpiece so beast like Delereese 
 I'm from the south streets of beast like Lil' Weez 
 E, F, baby, for the team I rep daily 
 I come to the defense like Champ Bailey, I'm gone wit it 
 A chrome kitted, a foam pit in the back of it 
 Phony tittie bitches come home with me, get the business 
 I made bling bling, I'm like a lighthouse 
 So shut that ice in 'cause he ain't iced out 
 Pay attention closely, you niggaz can never roast me 
 'Cause the maker of the testerosta knows me 
 Oh, he's so arrogant, the cocky kind 
 But you always looking 'cause I'ma shine, that's right 
 Get your shine on, get your shine on 
 Get your shine on, so nigga stop hatin' 
 Get your shine on, get your shine on 
 Get your shine on, you know we gonna make it 
 Get your shine on, get your shine on 
 Get your shine on, so nigga stop hatin' 
 Get your shine on, get your shine on 
 Get your shine on, you know we gonna make it 
 Loud mics and big rims, nigga that's my life 
 Comin' through the neighborhood with my homeboy price 
 Let's get it understood, nigga that's my price 
 Come through the neck of the woods, you'll be all right 
 'Cause I'm pimpin', I'm pimpin', pimpin', I'm comin' through 
 And I'm dippin', I'm dippin', dippin', them 22s 
 And they spinnin', they spinnin' spinnin', them sprewells nigga 
 Them sprewells nigga, we makin' mail nigga 
 Don't need no introduction in this 
 And I can grind in every ghetto, tryin' to stay hood rich 
 You can ask a nigga 'bout me, you know I'm 'bout my shit 
 I was made by guerillas, raised the hot boy click 
 'Cause I'm 'The Birdman' and I'll do you something bad 
 Have you heard man that I been slangin' them slacks 
 That's my word man, I won't stunt nigga 
 I gonna stunt nigga, I'm gonna stunt nigga, one 
 Get your shine on, get your shine on 
 Get your shine on, so nigga stop hatin' 
 Get your shine on, get your shine on 
 Get your shine on, you know we gonna make it 
 Get your shine on, get your shine on 
 Get your shine on, so nigga stop hatin' 
 Get your shine on, get your shine on 
 Get your shine on, you know we gonna make, one 
 So nigga stop hatin', you know we gonna make it
