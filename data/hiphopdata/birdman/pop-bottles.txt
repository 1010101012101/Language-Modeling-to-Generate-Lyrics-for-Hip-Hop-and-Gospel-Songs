(Intro: Birdman (Lil Wayne)) 
 (Start with straight shots and then pop bottles) (ya) brrr 
 (Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models) (uh-huh) believe that 
 (Start with straight shots and then pop bottles) (ya) 
 (Flirt wit the hood rats then pop models) 
 Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a championship game 
 (Look like I got on a championship ring) 
 'Cause I ball hard (no bitch we ball harder) 
 I am the Birdman (and I'm the J.R.) 
 (Verse: Lil Wayne) 
 Okay start wit straight shots and then pop bottles 
 Pour it on the models, shut up bitch swallow 
 If you can't swallow, shut up bitch gargle 
 Straight up out the water wit my Mark Jacob's goggles 
 I'm fresher than a muf**ka, yup I'm a muf**ka 
 No I wouldn't take ya girl but I shall take her tongue from her 
 Could you tell I love woman, like no other woman 
 Oh I'm sorry sweetheart, I thought you were my other woman

 Now as I recline behind my desk 
 I ain't got a lot of nikes but I got a lot of cheques (money) 
 Got my own shoe brand new on the set 
 Went from sittin' in a cell to sittin' on a jet 
 From shittin in a cell to shittin on a jet 
 I lost too many friends but I won too many bets (too many bets) 
 I made too much money I ain't made enough yet 
 So I scratch, and yes Junior is the best (shawty) 
 So many niggaz throw my hood on they back 
 So many niggaz from ya hood on they back 
 That's why we so paid and it be like that 
 I rather pop a bottle, befo I pop a gat

 Yeah, only sippin red champagne 
 White-tee red hat red bandana

 Fuckin' wit the Birdman we choppin yo companion 
 Fuckin' wit my son and we run up in ya mansion 
 Chopper make music, bitch start dancin 
 Stunna man back so you know the circumstances 
 And I'm cookin up the Carter 3 no advances (youngin) 
 All my cars automative automatic 
 No lie, we don't even drive no askin 
 Uptown we packin and we stackin (believe that) 
 Young Money Cash Money we the champion
