I keep my rims on the rocks 
 I keep my jims' on the rocks 
 I keep my drink on the rocks 
 That's how I'm living 'My life', 'My life', 'My life' 
 On the rocks 
 I keep my briefs on the rocks 
 I keep my platinum teef's, they on the rocks 
 I keep my bank on the rocks 
 That's how I'm living 'My life', 'My life', 'My life' 
 On the rocks 
 To that silver satin, ma', that's beautiful, daddy 
 I put them 22 rocks on that brand new Caddy 
 Y'know AMG wit' chromed kit pipes 
 Lord, Lord, Lord, that's a beautiful site 
 Aiy it's a milli milli, nigga, milli milli milli, nigga 
 Million blocks, million in rocks, nigga, million cars 
 The R-R-Rock Boy, rock your ice and rock your toy 
 It's the Birdman, daddy, no time na' pause 
 If y'know it's gon' rain, let it rock ya fall 
 Don't none, come from top but Birds and ball 
 I'm grateful for the man that gave it all 
 But I rock my world and I thank the man 
 'Cause I came in this bitch wit' my dick in my hand 
 Got that Caddy on broaders, block milla-walla 
 Nine millimeter make the baddest nigga ball up 
 I keep my rims on the rocks 
 I keep my jims' on the rocks 
 I keep my drink on the rocks 
 That's how I'm living 'My life', 'My life', 'My life' 
 On the rocks 
 I keep my briefs on the rocks 
 I keep my platinum teef's, they on the rocks 
 I keep my bank on the rocks 
 That's how I'm living 'My life', 'My life', 'My life' 
 On the rocks 
 My grill ma' straightened 'em all 
 Gucci, Gabbana, fuck the cost 
 Fendi, Prada, I burn it all 
 They been down, we gotta ball 
 You back it up, I'm loving that 
 I'm smacking up ya shorty back 
 Gambs' is up, better stack 
 I bought the truck, I covered that 
 Ghetto rich still lock them thangs 
 Money still in mansions, man 
 CMB, 10 a ki', wodie ain't nothing changed 
 But I still got my ghetto stripes 
 Red, blue and yellow ice 
 That's all I rock, fuck the cops 
 They want me in the jail fa' life 
 Aiy, I'm stuntin' tonight 
 It's going down tonight 
 I'm popping some Crist' 
 I'm looking fa some hoes to put on my list 
 Fits Tailored in the Vette with that platinum ass 
 That Gucci rag with the Bird in the bag 
 It's the Prada man, you prolly see me in brand new Jag 
 Gucci tailored, ma' don't tell me that 
 I keep my rims on the rocks 
 I keep my jims' on the rocks 
 I keep my drink on the rocks 
 That's how I'm living 'My life', 'My life', 'My life' 
 On the rocks 
 I keep my briefs on the rocks 
 I keep my platinum teef's, they on the rocks 
 I keep my bank on the rocks 
 That's how I'm living 'My life', 'My life', 'My life' 
 On the rocks 
 Nigga, I went from big Bok shoes in Rolls to 23 inches 
 This Cadillac so y'know I'm pimpin' 
 Fo' insuran' I don't play that, I'm filled wit' begets 
 Riding through Eastover look that is where I stay at 
 I drive a Bentley and park a Bentley 
 Buyin' rims by the feet 'cause they short on inches 
 Look, I'm on the block nigga, off the top, nigga 
 Go and cop nickels something on the rocks, nigga 
 Look, I spend my cash, Hood Rich, nigga don't ask 
 Croc-a-dile interior, the platinum glass 
 22 inch buttons on that G-Wag 
 Got the mink on the floor, swine seats lil' daddy 
 I'm the boss of the ghetto in the '98 Caddy 
 It's big pimpin', baby, I'm Weezy Wee Daddy 
 Got the green pinky ring, the rock 30 carats 
 I keep it all hood, nigga, check my status 
 I keep my rims on the rocks 
 I keep my jims' on the rocks 
 I keep my drink on the rocks 
 That's how I'm living 'My life', 'My life', 'My life' 
 On the rocks 
 I keep my briefs on the rocks 
 I keep my platinum teef's, they on the rocks 
 I keep my bank on the rocks 
 That's how I'm living 'My life', 'My life', 'My life' 
 On the rocks
