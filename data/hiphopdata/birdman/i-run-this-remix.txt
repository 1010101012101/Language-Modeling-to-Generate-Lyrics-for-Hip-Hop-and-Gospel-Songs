(Lil' Wayne:) 
 Uh, huh 
 Yeah 
 Check me out 
 Look 
 (Chorus: Birdman and Weezy:) 
 I run this bitch, and I'm a keep runnin' 
 I'm a keep runnin', but I'm never runnin' out of money 
 I'm a dog, I'm a stunt 
 If I don't do nothin', and my cars so pretty all these hoes wanna fuck it 
 I got pussie wet paint, big boy shoes 
 Soft ass seats, and my trunk go boom 
 I gotta black ass gun 
 And a bad yellow bitch 
 And it looks like I'm a die like this 
 (Verse 1: Birdman) 
 We be stuntin' on them bitches 
 Gettin' money on them bitches 
 250 on the wrist 
 Nigga we bes the illest 
 We be's the realest, CMB niggas 
 Uptown soldier with the money to the ceiling 
 Shinin' like a diamond, from a eagle to a pigeon 
 Birds on the wire, 100 deep and we chillin' 
 Finga on the trigga, that's that uptown livin' 
 High to the sky, no diving for fishes 
 Hustlin', doin' donut's in the Lamb 
 Candy on the slab, 50 on the ave. 
 100 at the crib, get it how you live 
 Stuntin' on these bitches 
 Red diamonds how I feel 
 I run this bitch 
 (Chorus: Birdman and Weezy) 
 And I'm a keep runnin' 
 I'm a keep runnin', but I'm never runnin' out of money 
 I'm a dog, I'm a stunt 
 If I don't do nothin', and my cars so pretty all these hoes wanna fuck it 
 I got pussie wet paint, big boy shoes 
 Soft ass seats, and my trunk go boom 
 I gotta black ass gun 
 And a bad yellow bitch 
 And it looks like I'm a die like this 
 (Verse 2: Lil' Wayne) 
 Hollygrove gangsta, Eagle street animal 
 I'll have my goons jack something like Samuel (?) 
 If you want beef, bring your cows 
 I will cattle you, 
 Yeah I see you player but, I'm the most valuable 
 I am so radical, my Lamborghini got on a bikini 
 That mean it's topless, you seen it on the beach 
 When I skeet the girl (?), keep the purp, keep the syrup 
 Lord I be gettin' on peoples nerve 
 But people can kiss my peepin' pherb 
 I'm first and y'all (?) in third 
 Da-da-da-dat my word 
 Count money, Young money 
 Da-da-da dat who got more beat (?) 
 Whe-When you come for me 
 Everytime, anytime, I'm gon' beat you at the finish line cause, 
 (Chorus: Birdman and Weezy) 
 I run this bitch, and I'm a keep runnin' 
 I'm a keep runnin', but I'm never runnin' out of money 
 I'm a dog, I'm a stunt 
 If I don't do nothin', and my cars so pretty all these hoes wanna fuck it 
 I got pussie wet paint, big boy shoes 
 Soft ass seats, and my trunk go boom 
 I gotta black ass gun 
 And a bad yellow bitch 
 And it looks like I'm a die like this 
 (Verse 3: Birdman) 
 I'm a uptown solider 
 Known high rolla 
 Money go getta, M.O.B. all over 
 Hustlin with the birds, go and take it off his shoulder 
 Grindin' with the homies, got the game out the nose 
 100 gs wrap, hood with a strap 
 Blowin' on the dojo, nigga stuntin in a 'lac 
 Chicken in the oven, wall safe for the stack 
 Bought a brand new range, and a brand new 'bac 
 Old school caddy, fifth wheel slab back 
 Brand new truck, a brand new bike 
 A brand new house, a brand new sike 
 A brand new bitch with a hood rich life 
 (Chorus: Birdman and Weezy) 
 I run this bitch, and I'm a keep runnin' 
 I'm a keep runnin', but I'm never runnin' out of money 
 I'm a dog, I'm a stunt 
 If I don't do nothin', and my cars so pretty all these hoes wanna fuck it 
 I got pussie wet paint, big boy shoes 
 Soft ass seats, and my trunk go boom 
 I gotta black ass gun 
 And a bad yellow bitch 
 And it looks like I'm a die like this (x2)
