I couldn't have done it better 
 I couldn't have done this shit any other way 
 I made it now when they tried to 
 Convince me to make it another day 
 Glad I can see another day 
 I do this shit for my squad, my home team 
 My family, fuck what another say 
 I'm here now, it's all clear now 
 Somebody pour up, I'm eating good 
 Y'all can't see my competition till I throw up 
 I'm tore up but I keep shit 100 
 That's from the toes up 
 Last night it felt like I ran through four clubs 
 Stood on the couch and everyone of em' screaming out 
 "Hoes down and bros up" 
 It's different when we show up, kicking doors up 
 I'm a young Stunna, young Wayne, I'm Young Money 
 I'm growned up like I'm new here but I'm nuclear 
 That's a bomb threat mothafucker, I'm tryna blow up 
 I'm good, I'm reminded I'm good from time to time 
 I'm fine, I be spending time with the Greatest Of All Time all the time 
 And ever since I'm living life every night like it's '99 
 I'm way ahead of my time I think I was only 8 at that time 
 I rep them five letters forever 
 Will someone just tell the bartender to mix my drink 
 While I mix my thoughts my business in pleasure, I'm clever 
 Long money all around me 
 I just hope I live long enough, long enough to measure 
 We should take pictures sippin' Cristal in COOGI sweaters 
 And I'm still getting better nigga, what's better? 
 They said I never do it now I'm looking around like, nigga what's never? 
 And now they run from us when they see us, boy that money's pressure 
 Plots on the wall of every building that I walk into 
 Phone taps 'cause they curious, careful what you talk into 
 Living the star life you'll never know you'll run into like 
 Baby I can change your life 
 Just leave everything that you been through and rise 
 Long as my niggas right then we all right 
 Long as the women right then we all right 
 Long as the drinks on ice then we all right 
 Long as these private flights then we all right 
 Long as we living right then we all right 
 Long as it's high life then we all right 
 'Cause I love it more than anything 
 Boy it's money over everything, we been all right 
 Yeah, It's money over everything 
 We motivated, flying over everything 
 We make something out of nothing, what up 5? 
 Bag full of every president that ever died 
 Yeah, spraying everything that's in the way 
 We eating over here extended clips, 50 plates 
 It's a lifestyle, stunna life, everyday 
 A million ones we can throw this shit a million ways 
 Youngin, if you all right then we all right 
 Night life GTV popping every night 
 Fly rich in a different city bright lights 
 With my niggas, rich gang and living high life 
 Yeah, guns in the basement, millions in the wall 
 GTV cases, if it's fuck em' then it's fuck em' all 
 Atamos and cigars in them new toys 
 Long as my niggas right then we all right 
 Long as the women right then we all right 
 Long as the drinks on ice then we all right 
 Long as these private flights then we all right 
 Long as we living right then we all right 
 Long as it's high life then we all right 
 'Cause I love it more than anything 
 Boy it's money over everything, we been all right 
 Do this shit for riz-zeal 
 Young Money, Rich Gang 
 Ya heard me, with big ears 
 You just a crocodile, I drink a full cup of his tears 
 Can't recognize you nigga, like Santa cut off his beard 
 And Tunechi, he gon' be all right as long as he got his pills 
 I'm higher than my bitch bills 
 Stop cryin bout' em', bitch chill 
 I'm working on that Carter 5, I got this bitch in fifth gear 
 I can't stand these niggas 
 I'ma lie down or sit still 
 Get tied down with that fucking steel 
 At your eyebrow or your fucking grill 
 Catch you while you laid up, straight up, bunny ears 
 I shoot your fucking fade up 
 Badges don't touch me, if that pussy smell like 
 Cat fish salmon trout or guppies 
 I ain't trippin' on no ho, treat that ho like a servant 
 I know that ho better know, how to deep throat like a serpent 
 But lose lips shink ships, but I just let these hoes Worship 
 She think I'm a window of opportunity, close curtains 
 Tunechi 
 Long as my niggas right then we all right 
 Long as the women right then we all right 
 Long as the drinks on ice then we all right 
 Long as these private flights then we all right 
 Long as we living right then we all right 
 Long as it's high life then we all right 
 'Cause I love it more than anything 
 Boy it's money over everything, we been all right
