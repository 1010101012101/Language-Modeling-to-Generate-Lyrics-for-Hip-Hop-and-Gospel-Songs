 Nigga this is G shit 
 Straight up out the wars, from out the back of the projects 
 Where niggas pull cards and choppers get pulled out 
 Like you at the barber 
 Fresh up out the blue water like we at the harbor 
 This is my life (life) 
 A ghetto dream come true 
 Paper plates on the Benz (Benz), ridin' so new 
 On some 2011 shit, when I come through 
 Black paint, black seats 
 And the black rims, too 
 Can you see me mothafucka 
 I'm creeping on the low though 
 In the big-body four-door 
 With the four bar logo 
 Smokin' purple kush rolled up 
 In a damn splif getting high as 
 Mothafucka eagle dare drift 
 Ain't that some damn shit 
 And it's true though 
 But it ain't like I'm telling you 
 Something that you ain't knew though 
 So don't get it twisted like a noodle 
 I'll put one in your noodle 
 And leave a nigga twisted 
 So what it do, Bro

 Fuck the hollow tips we make the gasoline chase you 
 Smoke that fire shit, that shit'll gasoline face you
