 See me point that gun at y'all me no play 
 Me come for murder them all the cowboy way 
 Me lick a shot sprayed from me set me make way

 Him fro so dark and him hat so low 
 Me never ever ask to become solo 
 Now me head so hot and me dreads so cold 
 Me so poor 
 Me come them say Hey 
 See me point that gun at y'all me no play 
 Me come for murder them all the cowboy way 
 Me lick a shot sprayed from me set me make way 
 Me make way 
 Uh Oh No 
 Him fro so dark and him hat so low 
 Me never ever ask to become solo 
 Now me head so hot and me dreads so cold 
 Me so poor 
 Fat Joe 
 : 
 Coca Bitch 
 Here is something you can't understand 
 How I can just kill a man 
 Shame what the mack can do, K's spit faster 
 I'll make an ass of you, save the theatrics 
 Watch like a quarter mil, chain like double that 
 I ain't gotta to talk about the half up in the duffel bag 
 Stunna my brother, Weezy Wee the syndicate 
 Hundred Phantoms, hundred Maybachs, I guess we're niggerich 
 I'll yellow bottle your face in, trust me 
 Look at all the shit I be talking and no one touched me 
 "Pray and pray for my downfall" 
 BIG said it; so I made it rain till it poured 
 Speak from the heart, this emotional rap 
 Catch feelings when you hear me, I'm supposed to do that. Crack 
 A G what the streets done made me 
 And the only language I speak is "Fuck You Pay Me!" 
 Bitch 
 Lil Wayne 
 : 
 And when me come them say Hey 
 See me point that gun at y'all me no play 
 Me come for murder them all the cowboy way 
 Me lick a shot sprayed from me set me make way 
 Me make way 
 Uh Oh No 
 Him fro so dark and him hat so low 
 Me never ever ask to become solo 
 Now me head so hot and me dreads so cold 
 Me so poor 
 Lil Wayne 
 : 
 Say Pardon 
 Bad man no take Pardon 
 Peer gunshot army them make backup 
 A man no fear no man, man no fear no one 
 Man a real Islam, man a get down done 
 A me no hear them talk, me eat in me car 
 Respect a soldier, him in a middle of war 
 Me I'm a Babylon gangster, holly grove monster 
 You no look familiar, roofers them kill ya 
 Gunshots I will cut then open toolbox and drill ya 
 Jump off body and let the mailman meal ya 
 Me think I'm gon need the almighty one to heal ya 
 And me behind the jungle with the lion and we killa

 Birdman 
 : 
 Yup! Put it in the air nigga 
 Light your lighters in the air 
 This for my dead homies 
 Yeah 
 Baby aka Birdman 
 : 
 "Gangsta Gangsta" that's what we yelling 
 Shoot him in his head, let his bitch go and tell them 
 We in the hood, getting money, we swelling 
 Bigger than life, you know it's the cheaper price 
 Bigger your stripes, you know what we doing tonight 
 We getting it right, we plan, then hit, then flight 
 We know the rules nigga, live by none 
 Get it by none, bitch I'll kill for my son 
 Lil Wayne 
 : 
 Yeah! Gangsters don't live that long 
 That's why we gotta party everyday like Frank came home 
 And it's hard for me to say that my heart ain't yearning 
 To walk up in a church and believe the sermon 
 But instead, I spark up and relieve the burning 
 Hoping that he understands my reasons for it 
 No, I ain't evil; I'm equal 
 And nigga I ain't sweet; motherfucker I'm diesel
