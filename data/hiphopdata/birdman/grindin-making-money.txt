 Lil Kim: 
 I grind all day gettin' money 
 Damn it take all day to count the money 
 I'm in the freezer neck full of iceicles 
 I'm a dime you other chickas need a nickel 
 Who that in the phantom (kimmy!) 
 Or maybe in that mazarati or that S1-50 
 Or in that bulgatti you can't fuck with me 
 I do this for my niggas on the grind 
 And never be another me 
 What you out your mind 
 I get it poppin' when it's money on the line 
 Damn I dropped the house on my wrist for the shine 
 Lambouton fendi dior all the time 
 I snitched in the louis store yeah I dropped the dime 
 Got baby and big daddy slim on the line 
 The way that we ball I'm sayin' is a crime 
 But we don't really care I continue gettin' mine 
 Cause this my 9 to 5

 Still livin' all that I like 
 Grindin makin' money
