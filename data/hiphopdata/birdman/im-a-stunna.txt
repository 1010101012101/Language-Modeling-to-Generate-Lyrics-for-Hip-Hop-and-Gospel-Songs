Yeah nigga 
 That's what it do, that's what it does, that's what it is 
 And what always was 
 You heard me, believe that 
 This what is hidden for homeboy 
 Take this one to the bank nigga 
 And I can't fall for that, believe that 
 Bitch I'm a stunna, rap hunna 
 I'm just a nigga with a whole lot-a-money 
 Bitch I'm a stunna, rap hunna 
 (Yeah) Is a mobeek (yeah) with the money and power 
 Nigga we don't move hoes, we move 'em home 
 Got the game from the Gs nigga straight of the floor 
 Uptown nigga with a uptown soul 
 Flip a ice neat nigga drive a red rose 
 Hold up in the kitchen gotta heavy on the load 
 Hustle from the front straight to the back door 
 Money like trees flippin' these flees 
 Bitches all over 'cause they know we got cheese 
 Rife M.O.B that's how it'd be 
 Cook a whole G let him, let him fly on the street 
 Tall like a motherfucker condo on the beach 
 That's how we livin' with the datas on the seats 
 Bitch I'm a stunna, rap hunna 
 I'm just a nigga with a whole lot-a-money 
 Bitch I'm a stunna, rap hunna 
 (Yeah) Is a mobeek (yeah) with the money and power 
 We put the marble on the floor 'cause we shine condo 
 The niggas act like hoes we let them all go 
 Coming of the ceilin' with the chopper and some dope
