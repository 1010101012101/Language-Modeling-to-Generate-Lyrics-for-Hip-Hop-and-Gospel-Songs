Rest in peace to my momma, rest in peace to my daddy 
 Rest in peace to my homie, rest in peace to my family 
 Rest in peace to my D boy, my OG boy, told me be a B boy 
 Rest in peace to my cause, money is the love 
 Disrespect me bitches, it's murder up in bloods 
 Rest in peace to my homies in the pen 
 Ain't comin' home and that they can't win 
 My homie momma died he was 5 
 Brought him to the street life taught 'em to survive 
 Block was his daddy, tatts in the caddy now 
 Blowin' on that gonja lil' homie had to have it huh 
 Full of that aroma, gun alone taught 'em the corner 
 Nigga life in the streets homie up in the mornin' 
 See we G's fuckin' with these flees 
 Work in they house and you know we got to eat 
 Youngster wanna be a gangster like me 
 I let 'em all see so they know how it be 
 Streets is a motherfucker game of life 
 Playin' the hard part of it is livin' it twice 
 Fresh with the money now, cruisin' in the Lambo 
 Time to change hoe but money still the same though 
 Bitches with the murder, murder with the bitches 
 Homies in my hood nigga trippin' 'bout they riches 
 Rest in peace to my momma, rest in peace to my daddy 
 Rest in peace to my homie, rest in peace to my family 
 Rest in peace to my D boy, my OG boy, told me be a B boy 
 Rest in peace to my cause, money is the love 
 Disrespect me bitches its murder up in bloods 
 Rest in peace to my homies in the pen 
 Ain't comin' home and that they can't win 
 See my homie caught life, couldn't do it twice 
 He held court on the street that night 
 Nobody trippin' but the hood be flippin' 
 On the laws, fuck 'em out they jaws 
 Fuck 'em in they cars 
 You know my hood, we don't spare nothin' blood 
 You know my streets nigga fucked up in the mud 
 You know the cost when you playin' with the boss 
 Your life is lost when your playin' with boss 
 We in the club, showin' some hoes love 
 Nigga want trip but I keep his hoe hugged 
 He killed my homie nigga but he didn't kill his family though 
 I'ma real nigga so I'm ridin' for his family hoe 
 Got to get the cheese flippin' these B's 
 Fuckin' with these hoes, burn a few G's 
 Playin' the game right while up in these buildings 
 Tryin' to be the next billion 
 Rest in peace to my momma, rest in peace to my daddy 
 Rest in peace to my homie, rest in peace to my family 
 Rest in peace to my D boy, my OG boy, told me be a B boy 
 Rest in peace to my cause, money is the love 
 Disrespect me bitches its murder up in bloods 
 Rest in peace to my homies in the pen 
 Ain't comin' home and that they can't win 
 So I roll with my heater, ridin' with my heater 
 Never leave my bitch, call her millimeter 
 Cruise with my hoe on the road with my hoe 
 Nigga hustle with my hoe, nigga fuck with my hoe 
 Never leave my bitch she hard core rich 
 Purely white top nigga, ain't hit quick 
 16 nigga better yet banana clip 
 Gotta brother names chopper nigga break down bricks 
 45 snub met his whole blood 
 2, 2, 6 nigga that uptown plug 
 Flippin' through the curb, gave the homie word 
 Penitentiary chance when fuckin' with them birds 
 Back to my block though, millions won't stop hoe 
 From the bottom to the top with this cash flow 
 I'm in my caddy bitch, livin' lavish bitch 
 Livin' with the homie nigga quick to grab my shit 
 Rest in peace to my momma, rest in peace to my daddy 
 Rest in peace to my homie, rest in peace to my family 
 Rest in peace to my D boy, my OG boy, told me be a B boy 
 Rest in peace to my cause, money is the love 
 Disrespect me bitches its murder up in bloods 
 Rest in peace to my homies in the pen 
 Ain't comin' home and that they can't win
