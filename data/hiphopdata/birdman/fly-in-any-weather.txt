 (I'm fly in any weather) 
 When it comes to these cars 
 (I puts it together) 
 See I switch my paint 
 (And change my leather) 
 Got mami the new Benz and plucked her feathers 
 The Carson Eagles, come fly with me 
 Sway hair lighter then eyes could see 
 You can have whatever your eyes could see 
 ('Cause you the Numba 1 Stunna) 
 Come fly with me

 Rain or snow I'm still the shit, I'm the Numba 1 Stunna

 Got the new Cardierres with the iced out lens

 Gator on the eyes with the chips in the end

 Got mami the new Benz and plucked her feathers 
 The Carson Eagles, come fly with me 
 Sway hair lighter then eyes could see 
 You can have whatever your eyes could see 
 ('Cause you the Numba 1 Stunna) 
 Come fly with me

 (With Sausage chains) 
 I salt nigga shine 
 (And couldn't maintain) 
 So I hadda step back 
 (And fly away man) 
 'Cause it's all about collecting 
 (All my chains) 
 See I cook shit, swing around, fly away quick 
 Put it in the oven, mami hold my shit 
 I'm the flyest nigga with the flyest bitch

 See I duck on these niggas when I hold my thang 
 And if you fuck with me bad I'll bust your brain 
 See I fly like a bird 
 Got mami the new fur 
 Slang back, royal blue fits the curves 
 Stilletto high boots and she smoke that herb 
 (She the Birdlady, baby) 
 Ain't scared to hold hers 
 She came through your hood with the fly ass suburb
