Ah ha 
 Who We 
 Young Weezy Baby 
 Awwoooo 
 I won't deny it 
 I'm a fuckin' rider 
 You don't want to fuck with me 
 But I bet she gon want to fuck with me 
 Cause who wouldn't want to fuck with me 
 Now I can't tell you fuck 'bout the next man 
 But he ain't got nothin' on me 
 So baby you should bury him 
 And just marry me, just marry me 
 OK I'm lookin' for a redbone 
 And when I get her I'm goin' 
 Tap it like a Fed Phone 
 And shawty talk about her man 
 She said tired of him 
 I said well baby I'm gonna have you 
 Tryin' to hide from him 
 And if it's weezy 
 Then the women want to lie to him 
 And I'm gon give it to e,' 
 Mama said give it to em' 
 So I'm gon give it to her 
 Just the way she want it 
 I said girl 
 I'm tryin' to put my name on it 
 I'm tryin' to own it 
 Welcome to my ranch and 
 I'm gon act a donkey 
 From the mornin' till the night 
 Till the mornin' 
 And if you back it up 
 Then I'm gon jump on it 
 I said I won't deny her 
 Shawty is a rider 
 And she gon ride for me 
 I said she lookin' 
 Like my bride to be 
 Take one knee 
 Let me take one knee 
 And I said baby will you marry me 
 We'll live ever after happily 
 Just the way it's supposed to be 
 Just you and me, just you and me 
 Yeah shawty said she want a rider 
 And I could be that it much 
 More like a provider 
 I can provide her 
 And if you lookin' for me 
 I'm prolly inside her 
 You only like her 
 I'm tryin' to wife her 
 See I'm a lighter 
 And she's my fire 
 See we are tighter 
 Than grip pliers 
 She gets me higher 
 Higher than my purp 
 Shawty so bright when you 
 Look at her make your eyes hurt 
 Better get a visor 
 Oh yeah she cold 
 Yeah she cooler than an ice burg 
 Fuck what you might heard 
 You only like her 
 I'm tryin' to wife her
