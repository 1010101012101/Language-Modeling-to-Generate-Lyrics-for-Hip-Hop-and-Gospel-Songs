(Intro - Birdman) 
 Yeah 
 So priceless 
 Life so priceless nigga 
 You understand me? 
 It's just like that 
 My car so priceless 
 My bitch so priceless 
 My familia is so priceless nigga 
 You understand me? 
 Either you with us 
 Or you ain't with us 
 Either you in the huddle 
 Or you out the huddle 
 Either you riding 
 Or we passing, flying by saying "fuck you" 
 It's Young Money Cash Money playboy 
 That's about the size of it 
 At the roof top 
 So hot up here nigga 
 Yeah 
 Let's go 
 (Chorus - Drake) 
 Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound 
 And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town, 
 Off a cup of C.J. Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown 
 And I'm easily influenced by the niggas I'm around 
 See that Aston Martin? When I start it hear the sound 
 I ain't never graduated I ain't got no cap and gown 
 But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass 
 Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground 
 (Verse 1 - Drake) 
 Yeah, all hail Mister Lyrical 
 Spades of the Opus baby 
 What you got a feeling for? 
 I can show you new things 
 Have you feeling spiritual 
 Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes, miracles 
 Okay they say that I'm the one in fact 
 Some say that I'm they favorite 
 But I ain't hearing none of that 
 I'm about my team hoe, Young Money running back 
 Cash Money superstar, where the fuck's Stunna at? 
 (Verse 2 - Birdman) 
 Untouchable, .40 with AK 
 Mastermind, big money heavy weight 
 On the grind, flipping money in every way 
 Head line, my bitch shine everyday 
 Pearl white Dom P., Marc Jacob gloves 
 Cartier, Louis case with a dope plug 
 From the mud where they wet you, leave you in your blood 
 Going in flipping hundreds get the young Blood 
 Show them where it go 
 Floating on the floor 
 Getting more dough 
 Grind hard go 
 Black diamond show 
 Watch the flame blow 
 And how you stay grounded? Cash no go 
 And how you stay mounded? Cash no flow 
 And how you stay shining? Bentley of the floor 
 And how you stay high? Purple pine dro 
 Diamond mink's furs, February snow 
 (Verse 3 - Lil Wayne) 
 Uh, you know you paid 
 When you got Baby with you 
 It's Young Money like Ben Frank's baby pictures 
 I'm a lady twister, I kiss her whiskers 
 I been running this shit, blisters 
 Sticking to the script, movie star money 
 And if you gassed up, I leave the car running 
 I'm a big smoker, I'm a little drinker 
 The peace sign is just a trigger and the middle finger 
 What you know about it? Man y'all clueless 
 I let two women ride me, now that's carpoolers 
 I rock stupid ice, Mister Water Coolers 
 If y'all in the building, than we are intruders 
 Simmer down pimping, let me handle this 
 I know the game, analyst 
 Man I'm the shit, and y'all janitors 
 Blow out the kush and crack a smile for the cameras
