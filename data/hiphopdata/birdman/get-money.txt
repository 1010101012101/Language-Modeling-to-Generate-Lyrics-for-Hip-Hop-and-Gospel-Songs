(T-Pain - Chorus) 
 Hey heh, hey heh 
 I'm gettin' money on the streets 
 Hey 
 You n-ggas don't know how to eat 
 Hey 
 Brrrrr-r-r-eh-eh-eh-eh 
 I turn a diamond to a dollar 
 If you know how to hustle n-gga holla 
 Hey 
 Brrrrr-r-r-eh-eh-eh-eh 
 I do it how I does it 
 I get it from my cousin 
 And you know who I am 
 Homie it don't really matter what you say 
 Say eh, say eh, say eh 
 Bitch I'm gettin' money 
 (Birdman) 
 We the business 
 Coming through shining 
 Blew a couple of hundreds 
 Big timing all the time, n-gga been stuntin 
 Pearl white Maybach, n-gga spent a mill 
 Bugatti for 2, on the hill 
 Shining with my strap in my right pocket 
 Hundred thousand a day on that sky rocket 
 From round the block doing this shit round the clock 
 Million dollar n-gga doing this sh-t non-stop 
 Swagged out, big dogging on a private flight 
 Popping bottles, celebrating living life 
 Blowing big, freelander down? 
 YMCMB n-gga, rich gang 
 (T-Pain - Chorus) 
 (Mack Maine) 
 Ugh, big dawg shit n-gga 
 I'm on my feet like dog shit n-gga 
 Tell 'em hatin' n-ggas miss me with that hatin' shit 
 And tell them bitches, my dick got a waiting list 
 I ain't trippin' n-gga I'm just taking trips 
 Put the money on the trampoline and make it flip 
 Young Mack, stupid Mack? 
 I just bought a coupe, the roof is translucent 
 Pockets on etc, Money talk bullsh-t, walk like George Jefferson 
 Virgins they ain't f-cking with us 
 Young Money Cash Money 
 F-ck them other n-ggas 
 (T-Pain - Chorus) 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 If I ain't getting money, than I'm getting p-ssy 
 I don't play with you p-ssies get a silver bullet 
 I know you looking so how I look 
 I don't f-ck with n-ggas, call me George Bush 
 It's Tunechi baby, the money man 
 The money talks, now I understand 
 That chopper make a n-gga do the running man 
 I would take a girl and turn her p-ssy to a punching bag 
 I'mma stunt my ass off, bitch that's word to Stunna man 
 School these bitch ass n-ggas, you are undergrad 
 The World is in my hand, smack the shit out you with my other hand 
 Young Money, Cash Money, welcome to Wonderland
