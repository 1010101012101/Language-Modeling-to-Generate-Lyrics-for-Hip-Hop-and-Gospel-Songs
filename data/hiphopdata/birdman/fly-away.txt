Hey, wassup pimp? 
 Birdman, mothafucker 
 The financial adviser of this get money game 
 It's Stunna, the big money man 
 So loosen up your strings 'cause you can get shot 
 The Crystal absolute is 'On The Rocks' 
 Ey nigga, I gotta stay, fly money 
 No baseball player, I got the a-ride money 
 I go to Jamaica, homie and ball like a dog 
 The leaf that sticky, homie and fog up the car 
 It's nothing to the icky, icky Harlem world sticky, sticky 
 Fifty, fifty, a gram raw cut dilly 
 Got minks on my body 'cause it costs too much 
 250 on the Bird had to frost me up 
 See, these gangstas, pimps and thugs make the world go round 
 Ride for uptown and till they lay you down 
 Birdman with them big chips 
 With the Bird Lady and the Benzes 
 (It's the fly away) 
 Fly, fly away 
 Or you can hit the highway 
 That's the only way that we do it 
 Love when we do it 
 (Oh, it's fly away) 
 It's fly away, it's fly away 
 (Fly away) 
 'Cause we gon' get you high today 
 I know you wanna see how we do it 
 You know how we do it 
 (The fly away) 
 Fly, fly away 
 So get your stock up, nigga, get our brains rapped right 
 The hood fucked up 'cause the nigga changed like 
 The Birdman Daddy keeps the bricks taped tight 
 A hundred of them things got my chips same night 
 Pull up in the Bentley with them skinny ass tires 
 Ice all over 'cause a nigga so fly 
 [Incomprehensible] and I'm doing what I'm doing 
 If them clubs gon' pop, I'm getting straight to 'em 
 Nothing on chain, I put them dubs on the thangs 
 Wipe a nigga down, bitch, give a nigga brains 
 Call a nigga changed, ma, wash a nigga range 
 Bird, baby, down with them Cardier frames 
 Gucci from head to toe and Stunna my name 
 Make winter weather and that's my thang 
 I'm iced up, nigga, smoke pounds of dro 
 And I'm labeled as a pimp and I mack a hoe, biatch 
 (It's the fly away) 
 Fly, fly away 
 (Fly away) 
 Or you can hit the highway 
 That's the only way that we do it 
 Love when we do it 
 (It's fly away) 
 It's fly away, it's fly away 
 (Fly away, fly away) 
 'Cause we gon' get you high today 
 I know you wanna see how we do it 
 You know how we do it 
 It's the worldwide callin' and the boss of the ballin' 
 A hood rich, nigga, Money tall as all 
 The youngers of 20 cheerin' and nobody starvin' 
 Nobody borrowin' 'cause nobody starvin' 
 Ey ey, TQueezy, the dro man callin' 
 Get it in the jar, Jeff Pense is callin' 
 Buy ounce, buy pound, buy enough for the rounds by mouth 
 'Cause ya know how it's going down 
 Dro party with the Magnolia chicks 
 Smoke just fly, nobody givin' lips 
 They all on the floor 'cause the brains is flying 
 On the outside it's just them 20 inch tires 
 Bentley, Lexus, Lams and Vets 
 Them Ragtop, Guccis with the Smitt n Wess 
 Got the old school caddies and them new school too 
 Platinum mouth niggaz and them gold mouth too, biatch 
 (It's the fly away) 
 Fly, fly away 
 (It's the fly away) 
 Or you can hit the highway 
 That's the only way that we do it 
 Love when we do it 
 (It's fly away) 
 It's fly away, it's fly away 
 (Fly away, fly away) 
 'Cause we gon' get you high today 
 I know you wanna see how we do it 
 You know how we do it 
 (The fly away) 
 Fly, fly away 
 The Birdman, bitch, coming to a city near you 
 Now how you luv that nigga, now I know what this is 
 You know what you need to do? 
 You need to look on the back of your CD cover 
 And get that sticker for the Mom Burberry G-nites 
 You want to come pick them up? 
 Come, pick them up on 6 and Magnolia and holla at ya boy c-ya? 
 You understand? And we gon' holla at ya another time, holla, biatch
