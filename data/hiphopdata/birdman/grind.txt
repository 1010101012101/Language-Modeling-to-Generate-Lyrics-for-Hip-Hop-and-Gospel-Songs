(Intro - Lil Wayne) 
 And we gone grind 
 I say we gone grind 
 I say we gone grind (X2) 
 I'm grinding y'all 
 (Verse 1 - Birdman) 
 Fuck it we going to get it homie 
 Pop it and split it homie, live it and hustle homie 
 Grind till we billions homie, more money, new lens 
 More money, new Benz, more money, two twins 
 What we toting homie? 
 Got it from the bottom, raised to the top with it, hundred mill' rock with it 
 Hundred mill' drop with it, got the Benz and the Phantom like way back 
 Forty, fifty cars in my hood, bitch touch that 
 Play the model nigga, drinking out the bottle with it, on the island with it 
 Money and power with it, watch the little nigga jam on you bitches 
 While I'll be sitting on the island, nigga fucking these bitches 
 More hundred 
 [Chorus - Lil Wayne] X4 
 And we gone grind 
 I say we gone grind 
 I say we gone grind 
 (Verse 2 - Brisco) 
 Same clothes three days, watch me get my grind on 
 My auntie say I smoke too much, that's why a nigga mind gone 
 Can't stop hustling, I get it from my dad, all I know is box, Cuban stamps, and Ziploc bags 
 Rental cars tinted out, time to hit the interstate 
 Got a fetish for Ferraris and bad bitches I can renovate 
 I ain't talking penny weight, I'm talking big money 
 I'm talking breaking it down, to the last onion 
 Poppy know my forte, I get them and drop 
 And if they rolling up the rug, we shake them down and re-rock them 
 I got to get it, it's all about a dollar, I do it every day so I'm living blue collar 
 (Verse 3 - Birdman) 
 Shit, see I came across the state lines, know I had to get mines 
 Hundred mill' was the ticket, for a straight grind 
 Know I had to get back where I started, had to get back what I lost, new fleet that I ordered 
 Got more chips, flipping out the other licks 
 Bad for the birds homie, born hood rich 
 Came from the rockets straight to the topics 
 That's how we getting it, big money won't stop it 
 More hundred
