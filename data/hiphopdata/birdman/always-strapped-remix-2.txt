(Intro - DJ Khaled) 
 Aye yo Birdman, we been here before 
 This the G-mix, this the "Always Strapped" remix 
 Believe that, whoa 
 (Chorus - Lil Wayne) 
 Always strapped, when I hit the club 
 Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hug 
 And since I'm paid 
 Niggas be mugging me, you know I mug them back 
 Niggas be mugging me, you know I mug them back 
 (Verse 1 - Lil Wayne) 
 Twenty six inches, remix killer 
 Weezy F. the God, yeah Godzilla 
 I'm on that Bob Marley, I'm in a Ferrari 
 I mean a Ferrari, my flow is so fiery 
 I'm hotter than the sun, just call me Amar'e 
 I am so Iraq, what you know about it? 
 Young Money baby, Baby co-signed it 
 Young Money Cash Money, we are so giant 
 G4 flying, we are so private 
 Mile High Club, I need a co-pilot 
 What it do Stunna? Yeah your son it grown 
 Kick your feet up and I'ma bring the money home 
 Birdman Jr., mind that bird 
 Always strapped, combat first 
 Never back down, I lay you back down 
 Always strapped up, never put the strap down 
 Ha-ha 
 Young Moula baby! 
 (Verse 2 - Rick Ross) 
 Run with me or run from me 
 Pussies don't get pussy 
 CMB, Weezy, Birdman, Ross 
 Purple car, purple green, white work, polyurethane 
 That girl brain got a I.Q. 
 Her daddy in the chain gang claim Pyru 
 She want to look at me, I want to look at her 
 I roll with Cash Money, go ahead and look it up 
 Only the best grade, time to light it up 
 Spend a night with me baby, you could write a book 
 I influence so many, G5's, I done flew in so many 
 We so hot, so it's so finished 
 We globe trot, onto more business 
 Two stepping in my Chucks, always strapped, you know what's up 
 Triple C, you know that's us, CMB, you know what's up 
 (Verse 3 - Young Jeezy) 
 So good, you could smell it through the roof 
 Getting money, throw your hood out the roof 
 Right now nigga! 
 You know it ain't a remix without the Band Man 
 Flyest nigga in the club, he got on his ban bans 
 Why you call them ban bans? 
 Because they got them bands in it 
 Would of called them gram bags if it had them grams in it 
 You leave nothing at the crib, I got it all on 
 And I ain't leave nothing off, I got it all on 
 Say I'm trying to be rude, niggas ain't shit 
 They just trying to be dude, niggas ain't this 
 Pull up in something so stupid, like "what you think?" 
 Damn shades so dark, I can't even blink 
 Left the streets with bad habits, I can't spill my drink 
 Fuck around and have a flashback, I might need a sink 
 I get it in, I go hard, ask my old broad 
 Fuck cash, straight credit, that's my Gold Card 
 Always black, I'm in black always 
 Always strapped, yeah I'm strapped always 
 (Verse 4 - Birdman) 
 Pull the Bugatti up 
 But I still got my tool 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Everyday homicide riding with the jewels 
 AR-15, everywhere we move 
 Brand new shoes, money out the roof 
 Hard body, hard top, candy on the coupe 
 Cash Money is a dream, weigh triple beams 
 Grand dope fiends, living like high beams 
 Everyday hustle, got my hood online 
 Donuts full of hundreds, big money going to shine 
 Uptown soldier, five star G 
 Ten ki's on your feet, nigga sleeping where you sleep 
 Like father like son, two chrome .9's 
 Same bloodline, hustle all the time 
 Fly in the ride, G4 high 
 When I'm in the A, I'm high in the sky 
 One hundred
