(Kanye west/V.I.C.-Chorus) 
 In the night I hear them talk (yah) the coldest story ever told 
 (Aight) somewhere far along this road he lost his soul (to bad) to a woman so heartless 
 (Don't trust them hoes) how could you be so heartless (don't trust them hoes) how could you be so heartless how could 
 You be so heartless (don't trust them hoes) oh... how could you be so heartless 
 Know listen 
 (V.I.C 1st verse) 
 This old man he so mean all this woman how it all could be how they all make fun of you when you try to take them home 
 Like they innocent fuc* them hoes hi hoes yep-tee-dee I stay on top of my shi* mayne I ain't 'bout let a strange woman 
 Try to play me knowing she heartless try to heart break me nope you can get with this or you can get with that 
 You can let the front door hit you and the ass know hard feelings you ain't gotta talk back wanna I was talkin' broke you ain't 
 Want to talk back now I got cash (ping) to much spend now you see me ridin' on candyred ben not by the hair on my chinny chin chin 
 Well you ever taste this nicca again 
 In the night I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told 
 Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul 
 To a woman so heartless 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 (Kanye west/ 2nd verse) 
 How could be so Dr. Evil? 
 You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know 
 I decided we wasn't goin' speak so 
 Why we up 3 a.m. on the phone? 
 Why does she be so mad at me for? 
 Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold 
 I won't stop, won't mess my groove up 
 'Cause I already know how this thing go 
 You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me 
 They say that they don't see what you see in me 
 You wait a couple months then you gon' see 
 You'll never find nobody better than me 
 In the night I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told 
 Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul 
 To a woman so heartless 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 (K.West/3rd verse) 
 Talkin', talkin', talkin' talk 
 Baby let's just knock it off 
 They don't know what we been through 
 They don't know 'bout me and you 
 So I got somethin' new to see 
 And you just gon' keep hatin' me 
 And we just gon' be enemies 
 I know you can't believe 
 I could just leave it wrong 
 And you can't make it right 
 I'm gon' take off tonight 
 Into the night 
 In the night I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told 
 Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul 
 To a woman so heartless 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could you be so heartless?
