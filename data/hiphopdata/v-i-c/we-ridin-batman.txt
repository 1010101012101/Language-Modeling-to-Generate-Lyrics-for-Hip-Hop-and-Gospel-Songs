 (V.I.C.) 
 We flowin' mean skates 24 sides 
 I make it like a skatin' rink 
 Show 'em how we go ta glide 
 With them batman doors pokin' out wide 
 So if you standin' in my way I might getcha close side 
 Now you know how it is niggas hatin' on me 
 They don't know it's my time I been waitin' homey 
 They don't wanna see me shine, even my homies 
 And my frends I thought was fine I see they off on me 
 But forget them haters I'm a prayer 
 Tryin' ta make a quick escape 
 I think caper (?) it's a shame 
 They don't want me to get paper 
 (???) Others have it 
 I can feel it in my wallet 
 Why your lady keep on jockin' 
 Got me in your system.

 Hangin' out the window hollin' I don't give a damn 
 And if you don't give a damn let me see you rep your town 
 I'm swang-a-lang-a-lang the daddy da Hurricane 
 So you better get ya game for I be out da frame 
 I rep louisiana where we sip on tropicana 
 Them batman doors got 'em pullin' out they camera 
 What's down there mom I'm from the dirty south 
 Can't you tell by my swagger and them golds in my mouth 
 I could piss on 26s boy don't make me pull it out 
 I'm shinin' blindin' and blingin' I show you what I'm about 
 Y'all still buyin' Chargers and puttin' 'em on 24s 
 I'm cocked up on 26s with them batman doors

 Now when you see dem boys comin' with them judo eyes 
 And them bright headlights screamin' (Batman) 
 Kinda like a bat signal with my wings in the sky 
 'Cause I'm fly in my city like (Batman) 
 I be makin' all the haters covet 
 'Cause they envy how I does it 
 You what gives me God is with me 
 Something that you need to stomach 
 I don't think you want no problems 
 'Cause we will be quick to solve 'em 
 I deal with the problem solver 
 .44 I will revolve them 
 Flaging down the caped crusader 
 Ridin' here like navigators 
 Lookin' down at all you haters 
 I'm so high I hear your prayers 
 I'm just blessed to make a livin' 
 Where I'm from I won't forget it 
 Makin' millions by the minute 
 At this speed I need a (?)
