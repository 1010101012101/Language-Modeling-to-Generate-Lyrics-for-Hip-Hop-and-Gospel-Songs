The dance flow silly 
 The ladies gon' feel me

 My chain too silly

 The girls throw me dish 'cause my rims big billin' 
 My ride too sill 
 I ride too silly 
 We for fantastic 'cause I got a deally 
 'Cause now I'm I'm worth a million 
 Forget a rubber band 'cause you can't put a rubber band around a billion 
 I be wildin' on a island somewhere just like Gilligan 
 Drillin' who like a who like a dentist at the den like villerann 
 I ba ba ba I'm da man girlfriend 
 I'm da reason why you wanna lose ya man girlfriend 
 I'm calm like da sea 
 I'm blowed like the wind 
 And now that I'm straight I'm 'bout to act a fool again

 My shades too silly 'cause they made by cavalli 
 Jays so excited you can't find 'em lil' buddy 
 I'm not Nick Cannon but I'm wildin' out clubbin' 
 Watchin' everybody jockin' while I'm poppin' somethin' bubbly 
 Poppin' somethin' bubbly 
 I'm tryna do it big 
 Da boy from the A

 Dem hater in my way 
 I play this game to win 
 Watch me take 'em to the ally knock 'em all off like some cans 
 Drop drop drop imma sell like silly 
 'Cause ev'rybody dancin' and everybody feel me 
 With stack in my jeans just like my name was Billy 
 While I'm jockin' on you haters 
 Just like a pop-a-wheelie
