He don't love you, he don't love you 
 He don't love you, girl, he don't love you, girl 
 Girl, he don't know you, he don't know you 
 He don't know you, girl, nah, he don't love you, girl 
 Your boyfriend is not a man, he's a boyfriend 
 Just someone takin' up the place of a real man 
 I'm 24 and I can take you where you never been 
 And we ain't gotta leave the state to see where I've been 
 Just close ya eyes, close ya eyes, close ya eyes 
 And free your mind, free your mind, free you mind 
 Now open wide, open wide, open wide 
 And now I'm finna come inside 
 Now just when you thought here go the same routine 
 I got a bowl of strawberries and some whipped cream 
 And made a trail from your stomach to your clit ring 
 The strawberries' for you, girl, I'ma lick the cream 
 Blow my mind, so blow my mind 
 But before you do, girl, come in my room 
 And lay on the bed, and free your mind 
 I ain't thinkin' of me, girl, it's all about you 
 Girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that pussy 
 Hey girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that pussy 
 Hey girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that pussy 
 Hey girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that pussy 
 I know you wonder how I got a nice physique 
 When all I eat is sweets, I like that pussy meat 
 Ain't nothin' like a bowl of pussy when that pussy clean 
 Only a lame will starve a woman when she got a need 
 That's why your girl got a girl got a girlfriend 
 'Cause she be meetin' that pussy meow while you earl in 
 Watch out boys, lames, this for real man 
 Who love women, women? I love women 
 I love the way her body wiggle when I lick that clit 
 Victorious in the clitoris, my name is V.I.C 
 You want the niggas that are notorious for usin' dick 
 When I make her cum three times without usin' the dick 
 Where you get it from? I get it from my mamma 
 She taught me how to please 'em 'cause my mamma was a doctor 
 And if you wanna please 'em, I suggest that you should follow 
 Unless you like it quiet in your bed but mine holla 
 Blow my mind, so blow my mind 
 But before you do, girl, come in my room 
 And lay on the bed, and free your mind 
 I ain't thinkin' of me, girl, it's all about you 
 Girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that pussy 
 Hey girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that pussy 
 Hey girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that pussy 
 Hey girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that pussy 
 Enough foreplay, I know your body weak 
 Head to the left like you gon' go to sleep 
 But I ain't trippin', girl, that's how I want you to be 
 All wet, all tired and thinkin' 'bout the d 
 That's when I cock them legs back like no sir 
 And beat that pussy like, "Yeah girl, who's there?" 
 She bite her lips like, "Oh boy, you should" 
 And I be looking like, "Yeah girl, who's is this?" 
 Girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that 
 Girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that 
 Girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that, girl, gimme that
