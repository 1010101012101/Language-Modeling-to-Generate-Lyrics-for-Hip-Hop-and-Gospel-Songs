Im a beast 
 Watcha noe, 
 Watcha noe, watcha noe bout V.I.C. (x2) 
 I'm a beast 
 I'm a animal = Chorus 
 Beast 
 I'm a animal 
 Beast 
 I'm a animal (x2) 
 They be calling my label 
 Asking where they find me 
 Because there's nothing comparing 
 There's nothing that's like me 
 In addition to claims 
 A recencell decline me 
 Gotta helk in my artist 
 Here to adjust decline it 
 I'm a beast 
 Who they running to 
 Who you running to 
 It don't matter where you running I will find you 
 You better hope you recencell me from itunes 
 'Cause when I drop y'all cool 
 I'm hot y'all cool 
 New anthem new beats I rule 
 No hula no class just straight school 
 And I can't skip lunch 'cause they food 
 Y'all can't win 'cause I can't loose 
 Like fifty I create more jirule 
 I'm killing this game so blind as 
 It's so clear to it's my time 
 Fyi room by V.I.C. come dominate 
 The game so don't come trying, 
 This here beat of the chain 
 I'm feeling another part of reality 
 Hit when I represent the V.I.C. 
 Straight from the cp I'm feeling 
 Like I'm in Iraq I see allot of blood spilling 
 I'm killing niggas one by one and I'm filling 
 Like father like son yah 
 My daddy was a king 
 So I'm a king 
 Don't act don't play 
 Man you know what that means 
 I dacrow I am debow 
 Now I'm here I'm king 
 I'm running things now 
 I'm stealing like daddy 
 What you gona do 'bout it 
 I'm goin' for the steals my do I got it 
 V.I.C. is hard (x3) 
 V.I.C. is hard as hell 
 V.I.C. is hard (x3) 
 V.I.C. is hard as hell
