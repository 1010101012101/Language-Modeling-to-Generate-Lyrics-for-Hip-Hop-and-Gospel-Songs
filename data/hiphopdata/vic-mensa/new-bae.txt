Let me pick my face up off the floor I'm off the D'USSÉ 
 I've been going so hard this week and shit it's only Tuesday 
 I left my bitch at home, I think I need a new bae 
 I left my bitch at home, I think I need a new bae 
 Pull up, pull up, I poured a drink let's get twisted, get twisted some more 
 Yeah, better be good to me, baby 
 Girl, you better be good to me 
 I see your eyes when you look at me I see your soul 
 I see your soul, you better be good to me, girl 
 Yeah yeah, damn she so bad, Goddamn she look so good every time she get low 
 I ain't E-40 baby, but baby girl I'mma tell you when to go 
 We skip the bed every time that we fuck we get straight to the floor 
 I buy the ticket you get on the road 
 She says she live in Australia, I'll fly you out to Chicago 
 She doesn't like the cold weather, she wants a vacay, a vacay, in Cabo 
 She got the frame of a model, I wanna ride like a saddle 
 I fall in love with her, 5'7" stallion 
 Fresh out the shower, I'm licking your asshole 
 My new bae, you're my new bae 
 Let's make a movie, are we moving too fast? 
 Who cares? You're my new bae 
 With my drinking I'll be on the floor

 New bae, new bae, up in Sacramento 
 D'USSÉ, D'USSÉ with the Amaretto 
 Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang when I switch tempos 
 Put you on a new game, get experimental 
 Have you ever had your ass in the air, hands tied to the bed, legs tied to the leg post? 
 While your roommate watching, plotting, playing with herself like who gon' get the head most? 
 We can do the three-three, yeah, what about Kiki? 
 Bring her to the crib in the Hills with the studio, tell her we can have a little FeFe 
 Make you feel a way 
 I'mma run my finger in a spiral up your spine like a staircase 
 You know that I know the right spot girl 
 How you doing squats girl, I can make your legs shake 
 Hit you from the back, make the bed break 
 When I beat the brakes off it, yeah yeah 
 Pussy getting wet, let it marinate 
 Let a nigga taste something girl, yeah yeah 
 (Oh!) You are fucking with a Chicago nigga, like DJ Pharris 
 Say girl it ain't nothing to spend on a bottle 
 That's just cause your body the truth if I dare say, sound crazy 
 I know I'm talking crazy girl, blame it on the D'USSÉ 
 But you look so bad if you're good to me I might just make you my new bae
