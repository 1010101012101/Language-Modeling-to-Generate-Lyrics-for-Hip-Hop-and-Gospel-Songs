Free man shit 
 We don't need no cops 'round here 
 I got my dick in hand 'cause I know a lot of y'all niggas running scared 
 I got God on my side and I know the devil trying to take a nigga under 
 Really makes me wonder 
 And I'm feeling like the 2nd coming 
 As I fucked the world for the first time and she love it 
 I think this life is the only one for me 
 I wouldn't trade it for nothing, unless 
 She was 5'7", pretty waist, coke bottle, basket case 
 You know me I like the danger 
 You know me I like the danger 
 I'm on I-95 
 Double fist tequila when I drink and drive 
 2016 I gotta get it now 
 Pray to God I'm still alive 
 Put your lighters up 
 Let me take you where I was 
 Southside ain't safe outside 
 Seen a nigga standing on 47th street with a black Glock nine in the sky 
 Put your bangers up, twist your fingers up, bangers up 
 Niggas yelling "Game!" but niggas ain't tailored up 
 Nah, inked up, I'm tatted up 
 Run up on the studio and Rata-Tat-Tat it up (Rrrrrtttt!) 
 I let all my niggas talk for they self 
 They like to jugg, man they like easy money 
 They like making that shit hard for they self 
 I just realized I don't fuck with y'all 
 I just gotta stack my money tall 
 You know that feeling when you at the bank 
 Tryna quit cigarettes going through withdrawals 
 And you always knew you had what it takes 
 So you feeling like it's time that you take it all 
 Lying through they teeth niggas too fake 
 That's the reason really, really why I hate you all 
 That's how I feel out here, shit is real out here 
 Young niggas really out here in the field out here, yea 
 What's the deal out here? 
 Trying to turn a couple hundreds to a mil' out here, yea 
 And it's still our year 
 Niggas say they catching up they still not here 
 I'm looking around like 
 Where the fuck y'all at? 
 If you scared better keep your punk ass in the back 
 I think this life is the only one for me 
 I wouldn't trade it for nothing, unless 
 She was 5'7", pretty waist, coke bottle, basket case 
 You know me I like the danger 
 You know me I like the danger 
 I don't like the way that niggas talking like they bullet proof 
 'Til they gotta find out what a bullet do 
 Catch two in your Canada Goose 
 It'll turn a nigga into Proof, ooh 
 Shout out to my niggas on 8 Mile 
 Shout out my niggas on Flatbush 
 Man shout out to my niggas up in Cape Town 
 Gangbanging, rolling up the ops in the Backwoods 
 Don't get turned into a pack kid 
 You know how to act kid 
 You know where we at yea 
 You know what The Blueprint is 
 Ain't really shit for me and Jay to lay a nigga flat yea 
 And we build it from the ground man 
 I made the foundation like bitches with make-up 
 You flexing your Jacob 
 Get cut like a shape up 
 The city so hot it might dry the whole lake up 
 I need it God, I could ride like a race horse 
 I need a bitch to stay A1 like the steak sauce 
 Pussy so good I might stay like my pesos 
 Bitch and my gang, I'm the chief like a Halo 
 I go hard in the paint like a DayGlo 
 I tell Aoki he look like Tokyo 
 I'm on my new Hov and Nas it's a takeover 
 Young boy but I'm an OG like I'm Maco 
 I think this life is the only one for me 
 I wouldn't trade it for nothing, unless 
 She was 5'7", pretty waist, coke bottle, basket case 
 You know me I like the danger 
 You know me I like the danger
