You can never fade thee G they're so crazy 
 When they start to blaze after dark 
 You can never fade thee G they're so crazy 
 When they start to blaze after dark 
 Now I can take you on a maze of thangs but all I know is street life 
 20 some years and all I lived was the urban life 
 Shootin dice smokin' weed gettin' my hustle on 
 Makin' anybody raise up that try to do me wrong 
 Me and the homeys on the move tryin' to make a grip 
 Bumpin OGs in zone when we dip 
 Not to trip, unless you trip 
 Automatic will release 
 Dangled as peace 
 I'm stayin soldier to the streets 
 So tell me how do you feel 'cause I can't deal wit the anger 
 You niggaz be givin' I'm keepin' one in the chamber 
 The pressure is thick so I don't quit shootin game 
 And peepin our enemies violatin in my range 
 They say it don't change and heres a fact you should know 
 That niggaz don't hustle no matter where yo ass go 
 So when you think wrong 
 I'm thinkin' right, are you prepared to meet 
 Gotta be wise 'cause everythang ain't what it seems to be 
 You can never fade thee G they're so crazy 
 When they start to blaze after dark 
 You can never fade thee G they're so crazy 
 When they start to blaze after dark 
 Warren G- 
 In 6 before out shacks, cruisin each block 
 I'm lookin' for a space with my 40 glock cocked 
 Temple, Salt lake, 21st Lewis 
 I hits MLK 'cause I know I gots to do this 
 Some people say Warren would you please stick to rappin' 
 But this fool's pressin me so I gotta start capping 
 187 now I'm stuck out of luck 
 In the high powered module lookin' crazy as fuck 
 LBCing to the fullest 21, dominoes 
 Buck wheats, French braids and naked four doors 
 It's my city, my city's all good 
 Warren G kickin back with the Twinz in the hood 
 You can never fade thee G they're so crazy 
 When they start to blaze after dark 
 You can never fade thee G they're so crazy 
 When they start to blaze after dark 
 Tripp Locc- 
 Press up if you want to, believe that you'll get your feelings hurt 
 All you hear is the chirp, along with my wheels as I skirt 
 You shouldn't of tried to fade the Locc there ain't no get back 
 I meant that, get ready for combat it's like that 
 Prayin' that my homeys don't flip as I elevate 
 Bringin' nothing but heat stayin away from the weak links 
 Be your own man survive 
 Make that money grow 
 Whether it comes fast or it comes slow 
 Wayniac- 
 Either way it goes we step so I stick and move 
 Refuse to lose I choose to get the blues 
 Paid dues for years, but where were you niggaz then 
 Out flossin the boulevard being hard wit your friends 
 While I was at home puttin' in work 
 You think you goin' jerk 
 And take what's mine get me twisted with a skirt 
 I notice the difference 'cause I been back 
 On niggaz they true 
 But now I see it and its on since it's like that 
 You can never fade thee G they're so crazy 
 When they start to blaze after dark 
 You can never fade thee G they're so crazy 
 When they start to blaze after dark
