 When I step up in the place, your chance is gone 
 That bitch you was glancing on 
 If she leave with me, no chance that her pants is on 
 No bra, no panties on 
 Make her suck the same thing that my hand be on 
 Red room, thick bitch with a sandy tone, we gone 
 South beach in the Miami zone, Damn she grown 
 Bad little candy cone 
 One head nod from me, she out the door 
 One hand job from her, she out the door 
 Don't trip pronto bitch, out the door 
 Back to the beach, backyard, Delano 
 All bullshit aside, she a cold piece 
 The type that might go search the whole beach 
 The type that might go out and bring back some thing whack, screaming 
 Fuck Me, Fuck Me, Fuck Me 
 Toi 
 Sexy walking with that attitude 
 You're lookin' at me, I'm lookin' at you 
 Although I know I'm with my man, I just can't help but check for you 
 Lookin' at me, I'm looking at you 
 Sneaky ways, but I ain't mad at you 
 Lookin' at me, I'm looking at you 
 Just imagine how this could go, I want you so 
 And if you give me a chance, boy you know it's gonna get real

 I take mine, small waistline 
 Face of a dime, waste no time 
 Grind on the dick, take mine wit a lick. 
 You still be singing that Sunshine shit 
 It's your world girl, come collide with the dick. 
 Some Hot Zone champagne Heather Hunter, Dominique 
 Some moan shit, home alone on some groan shit, 
 King Kong make you moan wit this, and still want it all 
 In the club bathroom stall, backseat take your clothes off 
 I still fuck your broad. And all it take is one phone call, 
 Show up and I'm beatin' up all walls 
 No joke, she broke all laws, handcuff and it's a lost cause 
 Toi 
 Can we roll (Creep) 
 I got a spot where we can both let go (Creep) 
 If you can kick it holla let me know (She creeps) 
 I'll keep it on the low (Creep creep creep creep)

 Sexy walkin' with a street attitude 
 Love to get between the sheets and cheat on your dude 
 Besides, these drugs, got me in the mood 
 After the club we can choose how Stella got her groove 
 I ain't tryin' to be rude, meet at my room number 2-1-3 
 Private slumber party, with your name on the V-I-P 
 That's how we get crunk s-i-p remy and get drunk 
 Toi 
 Sexy walking with that attitude 
 You lookin' at me, I'm lookin' at you 
 Although I know I'm with my man, I just can't help but check for you 
 Lookin' at me, I'm looking at you

 Lookin' at me, I'm looking at you

 And if you give me a chance, boy you know it's gonna get real
