 (KRS-One) 
 Yeah Ungh Yeah Ungh! 
 Yeah Yeah Yeah! 
 We bout to do it like this 
 Word up all the way from the Bronx 
 LBC what's up? 
 Woo Let's do this 
 It's a movement 
 (Let's go, here we go!) 
 I'ma prove it 
 (Let's go, here we go!) 
 KRS-One 
 (Let's go, here we go!)

 Radio waves makin' you behave like a slave 
 So many ways to enhance what you crave 
 Microchips and optic clips have you lickin' your lips 
 With your eyes fixed on tits and fast whips 
 It's funny how we call cars whips 
 We slave for it 
 How many times were you beaten by they tricks 
 You lookin' at an eclipse 
 Faded dark spot in front of the light 
 Shut your eyes quick 
 International KRS passin through 
 When you spell Hip-Hop the H is always capital 
 Here's what we have to do 
 It ain't hard to see 
 KRS, Lil' AI, Warren G 
 That's the power 
 Ain't no calmin me 
 An open hour 
 They see the god in me 
 Pardon me 
 In hip-hop, your heart is free 
 What you tellin' me, KRS, LBC? 
 (Warren G) 
 South Bronx, South Side Bronx 
 Boogie Down to my G-Funk Productions 
 Mic check, one two 
 Move a little somethin' 
 Somethin' with my peeps 
 Hip-hop declaration of peace 
 Street movement (let's go, here we go!) 
 Let's keep it music (let's go, here we go!) 
 I'ma prove it (let's go, here we go!) 
 If you've got beef with Hip-Hop (let's go, here we go!) 
 International incomes so we're in the suite 
 Watchin Ichiro hittin runs life is sweet 
 I take it back where I'm from 
 Knowledge rules supreme over nearly everyone hmph 
 It's a shame how we caught up in the material lifestyle 
 And our next generation livin' wild 
 It's time for discipline time for listening 
 To this declaration of Hip-Hop christening 
 (Lil' AI) 
 My name is L-I-L AI, I'm Lil' AI, yo
