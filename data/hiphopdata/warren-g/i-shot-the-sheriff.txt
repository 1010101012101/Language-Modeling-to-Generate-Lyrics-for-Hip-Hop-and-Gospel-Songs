I shot the sheriff 
 Verse One: 
 I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable 
 He mistaked me for somebody who was liable 
 For all tha many murders l.a and war fields 
 We keep makin' war shields 
 Streets keep souls 
 Young brothers loose control 
 I seem to maintain through this 
 Watch where ya kick it they'll put you in a twist 
 And it ain't nobody like my down ass hommie 
 And tha police always tryin' to pin some bullshit on me 
 I keep away from fools 
 They do crime and it attracts cops 
 Cops got guns and cuffs 
 And cells to stuff you in 
 Verse Two: 
 They tryin' to stick with some bullshit that I did not do 
 You know who 
 The boys in blue 
 There they go with they assumpitons 
 Slaverys over let us have somethin' 
 Why you wanna pull me over? 
 'Cause I'm bumpin? 
 I just made a new song 
 My profession is music 
 Your profession is protection with gats 
 Then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away 
 I'm just tryin' to live my life today 
 So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops 
 Cops got guns and cuffs 
 And cells to stuff you in 
 Verse Three: 
 I shot the sheriff 
 I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to 
 'Cause in this game they always tryin' to blast you 
 And leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder 
 They harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man 
 The hommie day-dog got strapped but that's okay 
 'Cause I'm gonna work for life 
 So he can see another day 
 A hommies a hommie 
 A fake is a snake 
 Straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake 
 So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops 
 Cops got guns and cuffs 
 And cells to stuff you in
