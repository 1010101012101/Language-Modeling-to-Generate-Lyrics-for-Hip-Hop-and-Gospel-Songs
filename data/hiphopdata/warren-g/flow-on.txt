 Cedric Ceballos- 
 Now I told you once before it's the mad punk 
 Kickin rough stuff, quick dunk 
 Nigga back the funk up yeah 
 Give a nigga room yeah 
 Give a nigga space 
 Throw your hands in the air, westside's in the place 
 Word up, I got the formula, I'm mixin up the brew 
 Take the 40 to the head now what you gonna do 
 Deuce tre is in effect, like Keith don't Sweat 
 Don't need to break necks just to gets my respect 
 I stay smooth, until you try to get on my rough side 
 (What side) westside, fool try to take mine 
 Ya start to wonder, I know your name is Stevie 
 Don't think about it fool, 'cause you know you can't see me 
 23, the number's on the tip of your tongue 
 I got ends, and you can't have none 
 So a, slow ya roll deuce tre is in control 
 Listen pay attention and do what you are told, as I flow 
 Flow, flow on 
 Flow on, flow on 
 (Yeah, float on) 
 Flow, flow on 
 Flow on, flow on 
 (Yeah, keep floatin) 
 Tickity tock, don't stop, yeah the clock is still tickin 
 Ya booty chicken rhymes, mine's a finger lickin' 
 Bloodin, crippin, I hear ya body callin 
 I caugt it with my bangin' 'cause my skills are into ballin 
 (Mary J) ain't the way for me 
 I gets high off my jumpers and my dunks you see 
 So when the fans start to scream with the ooh and the ah 
 I like the bop bop, bop bop baa 
 (It's like 3 into the 2 and 2 into the 1) 
 Big balla 23 and my job ain't done 
 I get started like the hammer, I finish like Shaquille 
 When ya think ya heard my best well fool look a here 
 Look a here no fear, rap crystal clear 
 Flossin in my chevy with the wind in the air 
 But it's a westside thang, mic size thang 
 Winnin' battles ain't nothin' but a chicken wing 
 I eat 'em one by one, good clean fun 
 No need to bring a gun, come and get some 
 Of this lovable, hugable, my skills are so incredible 
 Stay like Jodeci, I don't know its time to go, as I flow 
 Flow, flow on 
 Flow on, flow on 
 (Keep floatin) 
 Flow, flow on 
 Flow on, flow on 
 (Yeah, straight floatin) 
 Now a verse 3, I think its time to wrap this thing up 
 Warren G flex the cut, make it go bumpidy bump 
 In my speaker, my sneakers go sqeaker, damn 
 Look at honey over there with the nice smooth features 
 She's on my nuts, oh no here she comes 
 (How's about a 68 and I owe you one) 
 I ain't wit the slippin, trippin', forget about honey dippin 
 I'm too caught up with my ends to be spittin' and drippin 
 Not Teddy, but I had the 1, 2 checker 
 (She know you got the money stackin high) yeah I betcha 
 (Do I know you from somewhere, boy you look familiar) 
 I'm the Snoop Doggy Dogg in ya life so can I hit ya 
 Later, 'cause it's my time to wreck it 
 Say my praire, rock the crowd, bring home the checkered 
 Spend a little, save the rest another show again 
 No complaints from the dog 'cause I love them ends 
 Got some fools tryin' to break me off proper like 
 See me bouncin' in my fo yeah I'm hoppin right 
 No need for the noise, whatcha shoutin about 
 Check my rear, three wheel motion, peace sign and I'm out 
 (Chorus) x4 to fade 
 Flow, flow on 
 Flow on, flow on 
 (Yeah, float on) 
 Flow, flow on 
 Flow on, flow on 
 (Yeah, keep floatin)
