(Gun shot) 
 I saw ppl dancing in the streets 
 Streets of a lonely city 
 Listen to the beats 
 The people strike their feet on the lonely concrete streets of... 
 Streets of a lonely city 
 (Warren G) 
 Some niggaz quick to get it confused 
 This is where its cracking at (wassup ?) 
 Big city of music 
 We're only half of that 
 What happens after midnight 
 Goes up spoke of 
 'Cause broke niggaz where I'm at they don't show no love 
 I done witness the concrete jungle in 
 Watch the niggaz turn soft and leave humble-in 
 Since I been young I hung out, hard knock 
 Played my hand when they delt my cards 
 Now check it out what's real is what's happening 
 Now this is where I deal with and where I live at 
 Not to many of us make (make it) it to see the day we able to make a statement (statement) 
 The ways of the world has gone crazy 
 Two things never change, that's the music and what the rules of the game is 
 Now everybody knows ur name 
 It ain't no other place to turn 
 But I better get a hold on this street shit I learnt it (learnt it) 
 I saw ppl dancing in the streets 
 Streets of a lonely city 
 Listen to the beats 
 The people strike their feet on the lonely concrete streets 
 Streets of a lonely city 
 (Warren G) 
 Take it back when I never had much 
 A little bad nigga scrappin over mad stuff (gimme that fool) 
 But I was born with a hunch for this shit 
 My nigga dead beats, still I hustle a bit 
 Help my mother make ends meet 
 Its hard is god watchin? 
 Non stop while the cops roll by on my block 
 I see paper dancing in the street 
 So what's the chance I can make the money work for me? 
 But it hurts to see yo niggaz do
