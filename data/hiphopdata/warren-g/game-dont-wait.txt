(Feat. Nate Dogg and Snoop Dogg) 
 I come to find out though, all these years, man 
 The game wont wait no matter who you are 
 Where you are or how you are 
 The game wont wait 
 It's a cold thang, it's a cold game 
 You know how it is 
 Game don't wait 
 Shit don't stop because the game don't wait 
 Game don't wait 
 Shit don't stop because the game don't wait 
 (Snoop) 
 Now all I, see is we 
 The LBC, 213s 
 Cheese and please and the reason the season 
 The click's off the heezy, Mr. Warren G Z 
 Gots to make it easy, for Snoop D Z 
 They come back, and drop raps and make snaps so easy 
 The most hunted, and most wanted 
 With a pocket full of hundreds, you know how we run it 
 (Warren G) 
 Snoop D woop pass the M-I-C 
 Anticipation 213 
 We contemplate, and regulate 
 Now we got the game tight, its money to make (money, money, money) 
 The game wont wait but you can wait for the game 
 Worldwide tour, with skirts screamin our name 
 (Snoop) 
 The hits don't stop because the game wont change 
 All we goin' to do is maintain, maintain 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 The hits don't stop because the game don't wait 
 I got no time for no payin' much rate 
 I gotta go out and buy some brand new clothes 
 Change my socks before they reveal my toes 
 The hits don't stop because the game don't wait 
 And the girls don't stop because the dick is straight 
 Let me teach you what I already know 
 The hits don't stop so its time I go 
 Game don't wait 
 Shit don't stop because the game don't wait 
 Game don't wait 
 Shit don't stop because the game don't wait 
 (Warren G) 
 Now it's the second time around ain't no phonies any fakes 
 Let me holla at cha tryin' to snake my stakes 
 You older than me, you say OG, you almost 40 
 Tryin' to stay young and sporty 
 Sport you roll me those and stay in ya place 
 Before you see all-stars, right up in ya face 
 (Snoop) 
 Youngsta never bite the hand that's feeds you 
 Proceed to get back to your folks, the loccs that need you 
 We do, we always keep it on the true 
 213, that's the name of the crew 
 Its true, that the dirt I did 
 As a kid got me caught up, but I was brought up 
 With the M-O if a D-O, so play your info, 
 Youngster I been doin' this before I hit the radizzo 
 Snoop D Z is off the heezey 
 So you can make mine, extra cheesy 
 The crew's a twist 'cause it consists of 
 3 riders, eastsiders, one love 
 The hits don't stop because the game won't change 
 All we ever wanted was a small time rap chain 
 Game don't wait 
 Shit don't stop because the game don't wait 
 Game don't wait 
 Shit don't stop because the game don't wait 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 The shit keeps movin it'll never stop 
 Long as we able to make hit roccs 
 Long as a papa can't stop my flow 
 The shit don't stop I gotta make my flow 
 The shit don't stop if you intend to take 
 The shit don't stop its companies we break 
 Take all the money and toss them hoes 
 The shit don't stop that's just how it goes 
 Game don't wait 
 Shit don't stop because the game don't wait 
 Game don't wait 
 Shit don't stop because the game don't wait
