Warren G- 
 1, 2 buckle my shoe, 
 3, 4 we gotta hit the store, 
 5, 6 back in the mix, 
 7, 8 Warren G and Nate, 
 Nate Dogg- 
 Bang to the boogy say up jump the boogy 
 To the rhythm of the boogidy beat 
 I don't love no hoes they know so they don't be fuckin' wit me 
 Warren G- 
 A long time ago I met Annie Mae 
 She was killing me softly like everyday 
 Penetentiary steel, was stickin for real 
 Blockbustin through the walls 
 Now I'm makin' housecalls 
 Nate Dogg- 
 I thought I'd met a lot of scandalous women, and then I met Annie Mae 
 Kinda thin light skinned big butt (yes y'all) 
 But she didn't have a place to stay 
 Warren G- 
 She was shackin at mine and shackin at his 
 Blowin' my socks, tellin' his biz 
 Nate Dogg this and Nate Dogg that 
 213 skirt, and we stay intact 
 So I told the homey Nate don't be mislead 
 Ain't no fun if the homey can't shake a leg 
 So I went to the house and knocked on the door 
 And guess who it was, Annie Mae you H-O 
 I once knew a trick named Annie Mae (ooh) 
 (I once met a bitch named Annie Mae) (Snoop Dogg) 
 I once knew a trick named Annie Mae (ooh) 
 I once knew a trick named Annie Mae 
 Nate Dogg- 
 Remember yesterday I asked you baby have I seen you somewhere before 
 With just one look, the pussy was took 
 'Cause I make music that you adore 
 Now I'm not sure and I might be trippin' 
 But in 94 I heard a song 
 It ain't no fun unless the homies can come 
 So Warren G put a condom on 
 Warren G- 
 Now Nate you know me and I know you 
 I got rubbers, gin and socco (?) too 
 So let's do the do, on how we do, 
 Never my boo, just a freak that I knew 
 Warren G- 
 Annie Mae, Annie Mae, you ran out of time 
 Warren G and Nate Dogg blew your mind 
 'Cause if you trickin wit him 
 You trickin wit me, you trickin wit the 2 1 muthafuckin 3 
 I came from rags to riches 
 Trustin no snitches 
 That's how we do on 9 S I X bitches 
 Buck em, fuck em, and put 'em in the trash 
 And jump in the 600 Benz and dash 
 Nate Dogg- 
 Hold up Warren before you go just a couple things I got to say 
 Are you goin' home, I wanna be alone 
 You need to take this... hoe
