(Warren G) 
 The place is here, the time is right 
 For the Twinz and Warren G to rip shit tonight, right 
 (Trip Locc) 
 Hold on tight to your seat 
 Comin' from the city that's low, urban life near the beach peep 
 So come one, come all, fall into my smooth flow 
 It's the Trip LO double C yo 
 The game is trump tight, ain't no need for you to boo me 
 'Cause after it's over, all you hoes goin' wanna do me 
 Its part of the plan to get mine from the jump 
 G-Dub hooked it up, so you know its gotta straight bump 
 A typical day on the eastside 
 A lot of gangstas buck mouths 
 And brothas slangin bean pies 
 But that's how it goes in the city where I was born 
 Familys mourn, niggaz slippin, never gettin' born 
 So that's why you gotta stay alert, 
 'Cause everyday somebody's out, they tryin' to put in a little work 
 For the hood, or just on the solo 
 Walkin' in Long Beach real late is a no no 
 But don't let me scare you, you do what you gotta do 
 Respect is a must, checkin' niggaz that try to check you 
 Y'alls niggaz betta recognize, 
 Focus your eyes 'cause my homey's high 
 Y'alls niggaz betta recognize, 
 E... E... E... E... Eastside 
 (Warren G) 
 Tick, tock, tickin to the Era 
 Its Warren G with the Twinz funk Era 
 N to the A to the T to the E 
 The S to the N to the double O P 
 (Wayniac) 
 I'm a take you on a trip, 
 So keep the game I display mane 
 I run it to ya in a gangsta kinda way (hey) 
 It's all good when you dealin' wit tha Locc 
 Stilll blazed the smoke wit the homies and the kin-folk 
 And ain't no nigga gonna be takin' mine 
 I'm servin' niggaz with a quicka picka up and on as a nine 
 So if you really wanna watch this trigga flow 
 Its kinda itchy but I know I shoulda pulled it a long time ago 
 'Cause I be connectin like dot to dot 
 So when it gets hot well I gotta shake the spot 
 And move to that other level see Wayniac comin' through in 94 LBC 
 (Twinz) 
 Now you know the game and the games complete 
 (Whys that?) 'cause the Twinz are bringin' nothin' but heat 
 And ya know you didn't wanna see the Cavi flow 
 (What kinda flow) the kinda flow that'll make you slow ya roll (ah) 
 (Warren G) 
 So open your eyes and pay attention 
 Its two of my homies on a muthafuckin mission 
 (Twinz) 
 And I, kicks up dust 'cause it's a must 
 And I, acts a fool 'cause it's my rule 
 So need we say more on this topic 
 Warren G droppped it 
 Put it in track and we locked it 
 Nigga did I rock it? 
 Nigga did I rock it? 
 (Warren G) 
 It really doesn't matter 'cause its still only poppin'
