Warren g: 
 It was a clear black night 
 A clear white moon 
 Warren G was on the streets 
 Trying to consume some skirts for the G 
 So I could get some funk 
 Rollin' in my ride 
 Chillin' all alone 
 Nate dogg: 
 Just hit the eastside of the LBC 
 On a mission tryna' find Mr Warren G 
 Seen a car full of girls 
 Ain't no need to twee 
 Girl you skirts know what's up with 213 
 Warren g: 
 So I hooks a left on 21 a Lewis 
 Some brothas shootin dice so I said 'let's do this' 
 I jumped out the ride 
 And said 'what's up' 
 Some brothas pulled some gats so I said 'I'm stuck' 
 Nate dogg: 
 Since these girls peepin me 
 Ama glide and swerve 
 These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb 
 Wanna think of better things than some horny tricks 
 I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix 
 Michael mcdonald: 
 I keep forgettin we're not in love anymore 
 I keep forgettin things will never be the same again 
 I keep forgettin how you made that so clear 
 I keep forgettin 
 Nate dogg: 
 I laid all them bustas down 
 I let my gat explode 
 Now I'm switchin my mind back into freak mode 
 If you want skirt sit back and observe 
 I just left a gang of hos over there on the curb 
 Warren g: 
 Now Nate got da freaks and that's a known fact 
 Before I got jacked I was on the same track 
 Back up, Back up, cause' it's on 
 N-A-T-E and me the Warren to the G 
 Michael mcdonald: 
 I keep forgettin we're not in love anymore 
 I keep forgettin things will never be the same again 
 I keep forgettin how you made that so clear 
 I keep forgettin 
 Everytime I... 
 Nate dogg: 
 Just like I thought they were in the same spot 
 In need of some desperate help 
 The Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of something else 
 One of them dames was sexy as hell I said 'ooh I like your size' 
 She said 'my cars broke down and you seem real nice would ya 
 Let me ride' 
 I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell 
 The next stop is the Eastside Motel 
 Woman/michael mcdonald: 
 I keep forgettin we're not in love anymore 
 I keep forgettin things will never be the same again 
 I keep forgettin how you made that so clear 
 I keep forgettin 
 Warren g: 
 I'm tweaking into a whole new era 
 G Funk step to this I dare ya 
 Funk on a whole new level 
 Nate dogg: 
 The rhythm is the base and the base is the treble 
 Warren g: 
 Chords, strings, we brings melody, G Funk where rhythm is life 
 And life is rhythm 
 Woman/michael mcdonald: 
 I keep forgettin we're not in love anymore 
 I keep forgettin things will never be the same again 
 I keep forgettin how you made that so clear 
 I keep forgettin
