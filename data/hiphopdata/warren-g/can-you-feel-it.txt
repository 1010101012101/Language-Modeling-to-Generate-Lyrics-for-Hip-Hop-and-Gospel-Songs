Lbc d-e-f-g 
 I'm H-I off J's bellin in a T-shirt and blue jeans 
 Well few dreams ever come true 
 Well some do, so nigga say (I'm from the beach too) 
 Long Beach City G's Funkin 
 And it's a pity who many we's punk and drunk 
 In a hotel lobby at a town near you 
 Housekeeper's high, and drinkin' beer too 
 Cleared through the night 
 My niggaz movin with the skirts 
 In the boxes, houseshoes, and slingshot t-shirts 
 Its gettin' late, I'm runnin' out of gas 
 So Warren G tryin' to see what's up on some ass 
 Really doe, y'all enjoyed the show, good 
 But what you know about these Long Beach boys in the hood 
 Should anything go wrong and niggaz act shitty 
 Remember fool this is Long Beach city, punk 
 Can you feel it 
 Can you feel it 
 Can you feel it 
 Can you feel it 
 Well it was boring until Warren G came on the scene 
 Put the G-Funk with the gangsta lean 
 It's been about 2, is he comin' through? 
 I dropped this one just to show you I'm true 
 People say Warren where'd you get that speech 
 In the sandy city right down by the beach 
 Speak, don't speak on, if you wanna speak on 
 If you wanna get yo groove on, LOC on 
 To the fullest, bounce rock skate, 
 A new time, a new rhyme, legislate 
 That's how we do it in the S-I-X 
 LBC, 213, and we straight shit at the next 
 So lets party hearty like Lodi Dodi 
 We punkin yo city you betta ask somebody 
 'Cause if you don't, we ain't showin no pity 
 More bounce to the ounce and we rockin' yo city 
 From city to city and state to state 
 This DJ gonna regulate 
 So playa hate if you want to, I don't give a fuck 
 I'm still G-dubb and I'm subbin in my truck so good luck 
 And have a nice trip 
 We got y'all town locked down like a vice grip 
 I'm on the dice tip, shootin C-notes 
 A dollar and the bones hollerin G-oats 
 'Cause we quotes, them gangsta raps 
 That y'all paid for, and we banks the snaps 
 We perhaps, if you could see what I see 
 Then you might be gettin' paid like this nigga Warren G 
 So fee, fie, foe, I'm from, the LB to the C nigga don't act dumb 
 Outta site, outta mind, so where y'all gonna put us 
 Warren G and the Twinz and my girls Five Footaz
