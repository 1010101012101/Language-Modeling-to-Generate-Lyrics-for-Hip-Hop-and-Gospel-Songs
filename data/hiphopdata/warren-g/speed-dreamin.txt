(Feat. Mista Grimm. George Clinton) 
 Speed dreamin' switchin in the fast lane 
 Speed dreamin' on in over drive 
 Speed dreamin' got it in cruse control 
 Trying to get back to where I shoulda been by know 
 Cadilacs stand to the tree line I making then be like 
 Swerving to the curv tires pealin rubber pealin 
 Pull up to a halt but then I'm thinking somewhat old 
 To talk in line to blablablablablabl... 
 Yeah yeah. 
 I got funk for all y'all from me to the bid dogs 
 Get your asses up pass the blunt 
 Smoke sum, after this go and poke some 
 Um excuse me warren I got something about substance abuse 
 Roll a half ounce up jump in my shit 
 Hit a swith watch it bounce up GOOD GRIEF 
 Meet me in the ELCO with GOLD LEAF 
 RIM big pimpin' like Filmore Slim 
 Tinted rim Mista Grimm rollin' shotgun hop one 
 Drop one, nigga hit'em with the BOP'N

 You can feel it in your bones like osteoporosis 
 West coast shit, I'm grabbin my go nads 
 And slangin' gangsta vocabs straight of the notepad 
 Aft the dope sack quote that gangsta funk 
 Warren G what y'all thought bringing the FUNK 
 You listening to G rhymes and I'm here to drop lines 
 I got that funky fly shit that you wanna hear all the time 
 All in your system like menthol YES YA'LL

 New material grand imperial, eat your Mista Grimm cereal 
 Hit the floor what's rough rugged 
 Twenty four karat nugget like the 
 Microphone's right here 'n' my gucci leather I'm thugish ruggish 
 To the bone marrow and soke 'n' linen apparel talkin' the double barrel 
 Black super hero RHYMIN' rappin' sittin' busting like its nothing still puffin' 
 Coughin chokin wild up in the fan's in Oakland floatin swerving taking the dirty version 
 Between persion sippin burban brand new escursion MESSEGE 
 Salt kills snails not playa's it's that West Covina rhyme saya yeah 
 Mista G R I M we didn't drop one with my uncle George we didn't lock one 
 Atomic dogg knee deep, in the fast lane 
 With the 454 engine block burnin' rubber for a block cycle like a Hich Cock flik 
 Trick, send us your thoughts, streamin while let'n our shots adrenaline pumpin' G dub say somethin' 
 SUPERCALAFRAGALOCUS you could quote this off that purple 
 You can blow this light up pass it around 
 We make the world go round like this g funk sound 
 I keep the pedal to the medal speed dreamin' 
 Slidin' dip 'n' glidin' chocolate tide eye 
 Com on jump in lets ride hop in the mother ship 
 And dip with Mista Grimm and Warren G 
 Grap that shiznit 
 (George Clinton) 
 Heres to that someone who can't take the puressure 
 Mercy for that poor fu who made the news 
 Who feel pissed on that insist on killing all men 
 Can't take the sorrow of the horrors of his abuse 
 It ain't worth the sorrows to cause the death ...all men 
 Hes a discrase to the species in to his face with some feacies 
 Big nose mothafucka got it comin' 
 How many licks does it take to get to the center of a sucka 
 How many days you have to be before you get absent 
 Warren G with the P you beta step aside I'll stick my foot so far up in your ass 
 The water his knee will rise above your head and drown before you get your ass kickin' 
 Stomp stepin' in footsteps hard to keep up with 
 Warren G stepin' hard but it ain't as hard as it goN get
