Yeah, if you want it I got it ya need it baby 
 Yeah, its Warren G beeyatch 
 Jah Skills- 
 (Jah Skills will just speak) 
 As I enter the G-Funk Era 
 (Tell me why you tweak) 
 Well I don't know why however 
 My mind is throbbing 
 I went bobbing for snapple 
 Mixed with E&J so my insides just crackle pop 
 Snap long time ago ya lost ya flow 
 Now you realize wack MCs I must chastize (what) 
 The gun totin bumpin indosmokin 
 Bad ass English 'cause its broken 
 Couldn't turn my styles even if ya had a token 
 You was hopin that I would quit but (aww shit) 
 I'm hangin' around like nut sacs with a dick 
 I'm sick, I know that styles abstract up your ass crack 
 Lovin' this shit called rap ass burnin through your back (Jah Skills 
 Muthafucka) 
 I'm stoppin' fools like blood clots 
 My lyrics rang out to stop parties like there was gun shots 
 Why oh why oh why well why not 
 Shouldn't I represent this shit called hip hop and it won't stop 
 Warren G- 
 Well are you high yet 
 Can you recollect ya talk shit you get checked 
 Mr. Smutly I'm not a punk thief 
 Let me break thee, smoke thee, choke thee and locc thee 
 Muthafuckin M-I-C right now how 
 Wow how dow wow how dow piggy pow 
 It's me, the Warren to the G gee G Z 
 It's me uh can I just please thee 
 Rock the muthafuckin M-I to the C all day all night 
 'Cause I will just fuckin' fight till I get mines 
 My ends, let me roll with my friends 
 Nigga you can't fuck with this 'cause uh I bends 
 When I bends my style 
 You can't see this 'cause I'm wicked and wild 
 Mr. Smutly just slow ya muthafuckin roll 
 It's me Warren G on the muthafuckin gangsta stroll 
 Rockin' with the T-W-I-N-Ss 
 So uh let me just bless this 
 Bo Roc- 
 Have you ever heard of a nigga called Warren G 
 Trip Locc- 
 There ain't no puzzle 
 I lets it be known that I'm the trip 
 Locc packin mo stackin mo shit than I did before 
 The real niggaz from the Eastside, darkside 
 Breakin off fools in my way on this whoo-ride 
 So best believe that I'm a threat 
 (Fuck a chin check) 
 I'm a shoot him while my nigga blaze up the buddha 
 And when we light it up, its on 
 A taste of the Chronic, another nigga gone, but gettin' his head 
 Flown 
 (So what you really wanna do) I'd a done it 
 'Cause yo mouth like zip loc so I know you won't run it 
 Top notch glock cock so you remember 
 The flow that I kick is nothin' less than a life ender 
 So watch yo step before you step into my path 
 Tryin' to take what's mine is some shit I just roll past 
 Wayniac- 
 Let me tell you how it goes 
 Prime example of a night stalker 
 Caught up in that bind 
 Usin' time with my hood as that street walker 
 (Gang bang) so I'm gonna have to take what's mine 
 Notorious bitches but I don't love no one time 
 So peep it as I take ya down the backstreet 
 Show you how I do it (how ya do it) 
 I breaks 'em off to get my ends meet (pow) 
 Victim of the ghetto so I'm sluggin 
 The man wont give me mine so the whitey I'll keep muggin 
 I'm trapped up in a cycle but I'm keepin' my humanity 
 'Cause I ain't goin' out (us niggaz always keep activity) 
 Niggaz say I'm crazy but to others I'm just nutty 
 'Cause I don't give a damn, ya life ain't shit without no money 
 That's why niggaz keep doin' niggaz but I'm not that nigga to be done 
 Ya fuckin' around and set it off Long Beach is where I'm from 
 G Child- 
 Whoo! Spacekateers, in case y'all didn't know 
 That was Warren G, that was Jah Skills, and that was the Twinz,

 Its on like that and its on like this, so don't miss
