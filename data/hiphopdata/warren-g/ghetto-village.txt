Would you like to go with me? 
 Down my dead end street? 
 Would you like to come with me? 
 To village ghetto life? 
 Lemme tell you 'bout the village where I dwell is a... 
 Living hell still tryin' to make a heaven outta this right here 
 Watching for the postman hopin' for paper 
 Please stop the bus mr. driver... wait up 
 We got... Rock fights where the dead end meets 
 The stop lights is out so its dead in the streets 
 The countyline look long but I'm kinda hungry 
 So I pack a sack lunch and got on 
 Late for class again its half past 10 and 
 Moms gonna whoop mah ass again 
 Now and then I get the feelin' that the world is mine 
 I start sittin' back watchin time fly by but uh... 
 But I'm so proud to say... that the ghetto is the reason that I'm loud today 
 And you could come get a glimpse of what's happenin' 
 See for yourself how it is where I live at 
 Would you like to go with me?

 It shouldn't take long to see 
 The place that belongs to me 
 It's all good, ain't nuttin like home to me 
 No diploma but uh... I got some knowledge out of 
 My other partners that made it up outta here 
 And not a whole lot of us get rich 
 But like the old saying goes ain't life a bitch? 
 Aw shit! the landlord just raised the rent, fuck dat! 
 Them old days that came and went like this 
 There's mo ways you could use your time instead of 
 Looking for shit that you used to find 
 By the age of 16 ya finally come to grips 
 Livin' life like this and nuttin else mean shit 
 Looking for a smooth getaway 
 Cool 'cause soon I'll see a better day 
 And if not... then I gots to deal with it 
 I ain't makin' this up hell naw its real nigga 
 Would you like to go with me? 
 Down my dead end street? 
 Would you like to come with me? 
 To village ghetto life? 
 No more suprises hopin I can open your eyes 
 And so I'm trying instead of lookin' up in the sky 
 I'm in the fast lane speed dreaming 
 Nappin on cruise control please believe it! 
 In my city when you see it that night 
 Look different than it does in the day 
 Ain't no tellin' what had happened if it wasn't this way 
 I ain't trippin' off of shit it's a good thang 
 I made a name off the local neighborhood gang 
 And at that time I started rhyming and... 
 Set up a hill without help to start climbin' 
 And now I've been around this for a minute 
 You gotta get ur own mix and get wit it 
 I made myself learn to pay myself 
 Nigga the game don't wait so ima stay myself 
 And now you can go and tell another nigga 
 Of how the real ones is livin' in the ghetto
