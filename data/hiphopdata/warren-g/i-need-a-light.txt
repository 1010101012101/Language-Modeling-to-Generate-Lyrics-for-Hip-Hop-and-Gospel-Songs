(Nate Dogg - chorus) 
 I need a light (light) 
 So I can smoke away this pain 
 I need a drink (drink) 
 So I can drink away this rain 
 Maybe a wife (wife) 
 Somebody to share my name 
 I need a song 
 A brand new song to sing 
 (Warren G) 
 Long Beach back in the day was all hustling 
 Young niggaz in the neighborhood struggling 
 Praying to god we amount to something 
 By living on the street where they constantly busting 
 Big Warren told us that they can't hold us 
 Niggaz ain't shit till they pass away 
 So I, watched my step 
 But when Ola Mae left I was a mothafucking basket case 
 For real 
 God bless me 
 'Cause I be on the east where they wanna arrest me 
 I break bread so they wanna suspect me 
 But look me in my eyes and say they wanna protect me 
 Yeah 
 Ruthless, my style as a juvenile 
 Ran with a gang, got me a profile 
 As a child in the Beach I was wild 
 Ready to die and that's why... 
 (Nate Dogg - chorus) 
 (Warren G) 
 Could it be it was all so simple 
 Dropping a slick instrumental 
 Snoop busting 'bout the shit we went through 
 Nate singing 'bout the city we came from 
 And niggaz so tight wasn't nothing we wouldn't do 
 Time keep slipping 
 But I ain't tripping nigga it's all about my children 
 So you can save that bullshit 
 'Cause if I pull my shit, nigga I'ma kill you 
 The streets is watching 
 And niggaz fell victim from L.A. to Watts and Compton 
 But life goes on 
 It's just another song if you ain't to one gone 
 Listen 
 Ruthless, my style as a juvenile 
 But now I got a brand new G-Child 
 Big Warren gotta stay trunk tight 
 'Cause he got the fly and that's why... 
 (Nate Dogg - chorus) 
 (Warren G) 
 Listen 
 Caviar wishes, twisting stitches, all out race for the riches 
 Got a nigga missing what rich is 
 And what a life mean if you do it for the kids 
 It's for my family y'all 
 Really the only one who understand me y'all 
 'Cause it ain't hard to ball 
 But then who got ya back when it's time to fall 
 And it's amazing 
 To stay up on top, your game so close to the pavement 
 Time brings change in mind 
 But then don't let the change bring your mind no time 
 Clearly, a conspiracy 
 Niggaz right near me but still ain't hearing me 
 That's how it's always gone fly 
 Till you ready to die and that's why... 
 (Nate Dogg - chorus)
