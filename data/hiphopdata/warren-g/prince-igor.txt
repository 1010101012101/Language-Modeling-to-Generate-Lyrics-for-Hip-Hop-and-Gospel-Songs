Verse 1 (Warren G): 
 Warren G top dog 
 Patrolling the beach 
 Niggaz say they hard as bricks 
 But they as soft as a peach 
 Claiming the G of all G's 
 Please, I come blowing through like the breeze 
 Sittin' on the threes 
 Post it coast it mashing down Pacific coast 
 And the bomb chrome rims black on black Yukon 
 With nuts hangin' from the city where the bangers be bangin' 
 It don't seem like shit is changin' 
 I hollered at the homie the other day 
 G'd up at the park sippin' Alizé 
 One of the homies took a beatin' 
 So now it's be in a gang checkin' at the meetin' 
 Life cycles repeatin' 
 It's just another sunset fallin' to sea 
 I can hear the homies the past calling me 
 And you know what I've discovered 
 What they keep saying: 
 Keep your mind on the money, 
 Mutha Fuckers, to shake busters 
 Chorus, in Russian (Sissel Kyrkjeb): 
 Улетай на крыльях ветра 
 Ты в край родной, родная песня наша, 
 Туда, где мы тебя свободно пели, 
 Где было так привольно нам с тобою. 
 Verse 2 (Warren G): 
 Have you ever sold millions? 
 But yet you niggaz persist and talk shit 
 Get off my dick 
 You'll never catch me slippin' 
 Rollin' with the heats 
 Slap da clippin' 
 I never thought the world'd start trippin' 
 My life's a trypto 
 Hit the crypto 
 Blow the whistle 
 They think I bang 
 So I'll pack a pistol 
 Warren to the G is a G 
 I don't fuck with you nigga 
 So don't fuck with me 
 With me let's ride 
 To the East side 
 Slide like a fo 
 I packs a fo-fo 
 When I'm steppin' outdo's 
 To the bang to the boogie 
 If I speak then I spoke 
 Warren G'll do it every time to you low 
 Get the party yeah 
 Like blazing smoke 
 The East side of the beach 
 West side the coast 
 You know the niggaz that I rock with hogs 
 Attack dogs that say niggaz are down to die 
 Verse 3 (Warren G): 
 Who's the man? 
 I've been from London to Japan 
 Stomp land to land 
 To the Egyptian sands 
 You can't check me, disrespect me 
 You mock me up 
 With the bass thumpin' out my truck 
 And all this police trying to lock me up 
 Money rules the world and I've made the loot 
 So don't make me shoot 
 'Cause tryin' to match you 
 Gets you done every time 
 I ain't tryin' to hurt nobody 
 But I'm down for mine 
 Biatch 
 Money over power 
 Power over money 
 Money over power 
 Power over money 
 Money over power 
 Power over money 
 Money over power 
 Power over money 
 Money over power 
 Biatch, biatch
