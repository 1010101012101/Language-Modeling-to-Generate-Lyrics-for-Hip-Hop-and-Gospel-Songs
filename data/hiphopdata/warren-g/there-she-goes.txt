Oh yeah I chill with Nate, Like I did as a youth 
 Its still 213, ain't nothing different with Snoop 
 Music is the tool I used to leave the hood with 
 Became my own man, I wish you would bitch! 
 I been around the world and back 
 Two times ain't nothing like home its cracking 
 After all the women, the money and the TV shows 
 I'm not really tryin' to see these hoes 
 (DJ Quik) 
 Now AMG said her eyes are the index to her soul 
 But when I look at her face, all I see is a ho 
 We sex playing, with the Hennessey, and she in the mood 
 While y'all see her as a broad dude, I see her as food 
 Take her back up to the bar to get her cigarette lit 
 I told her, "I be buying liquor like it Shh.." 
 She told me I'm a player motherfucker 
 Forget about it, she know the scam 
 And now she belly dancing to that Indian Jam 
 So hell, I'm a let her get a little more buzzed 
 Till she starts to get to slurrin and forget where she was 
 Take her purse out to her buddy car, back to the bar 
 For another round of drinks with a platinum star 
 I'm getting conceded, a lil' bit, the game owe me 
 I've been humble since my first hit, but back to baby 
 I'm a rub her on the belly, make her scoot down the couch 
 Look her right up in her eyes, and take some food out her mouth, She want it 
 (Chorus: Nate Dogg) 
 There she goes, the kind of girl that I wanted always 
 My favorite pro, oh I love how she got gangsta ways 
 I thought you should know, the way that I want it, I get it that way 
 Can't stand it no mo?, nobody does it better than she 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 When I Wake up in the morning, fresh up outta my dream 
 I ain't even finish yawning, still as hard as I can be 
 Even tho I haven't found her, I seen her when I was asleep 
 I'm pretty sure that she is out there 
 I'm pretty sure that there is some one else for me 
 Hey ho, Hey ho, now that I found you, I won't look any further 
 Hey ho, Hey ho, now that I found you, I won't look any further 
 (Chorus: Nate Dogg) 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 The first time I ever saw her, I couldn't look her in her face 
 I tried hard to ignore her, but I couldn't walk away 
 When I finally got the courage, I couldn't think of what to say 
 To make a long story shorter, I better bust a different way 
 I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face 
 She was kinda cavi to me 
 Had some nigga hanging on, I sent that busta home 
 And now she riding with me, There she go!
