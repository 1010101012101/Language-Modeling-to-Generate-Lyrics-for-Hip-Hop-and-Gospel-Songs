I'm a blood suckin, drug puffin' thug frontin', love muffin' 
 Why ma'am that's quite nice, yeah sure I'd love muffins 
 Warm from the oven covered honey oat and butter nut 
 Bake about 100 'cause I'm coming with my buddies (what up) 
 We don't mean to butt in, but there's nothing better coming up 
 Pack it in forget it ya strap on in, buckle up 
 Nothing but the truth, I'm telling you the truth 
 Hip-hop is still alive, and I am living proof 
 And in order to improve we must kill it at the root 
 Shooting for the knees not until you see these pupils 
 Youthful of useful youthful exuberance 
 Music refutes that abuses the rules 
 And of freedom of speech well freedom to speak 
 Let's see that as free time build 'em and teach 
 Yeah read it and weep cause reading increases your knowledge and ideas dealing in the street 
 While college is fine, and the library's vital god is the bomb, and LeVar is my idol 
 Crime story, mind story, autobiography, short story, long story, novel, or comedy 
 Non-fiction rhythme spittin' nonsense now not an option squashed it (squashed) stop it (stop) 
 The not has been noddin' they noddin' they noggins, and now the real start of the truth 
 So move with the movement, movement of humans 
 Using the tools we were born with 
 Or you can forfeit your fortunes to the less fortunate 
 Unfortunately the poor kids are forced to form they thoughts on things formally taught to them it seems to be the least important part to think and dream believing things could never get any better than this 
 So rejecting intellect neglecting interest the internet becomes a nest of sex 
 Best described as extra time to emphasize what mom and papa tried to hide 
 Eject the desktop inject the Xbox 
 And let's not stop there watch this head-shot and watch they head pop open and then drop to the floor keep going cause nobody said stop 
 Our only hope is the music they listening to influencing they intution ability to 
 Recognize between right and wrong it's either hit or miss no intermission and intermission is on 
 A light goes on an idea to volunteer my time, my mind, my rhythme defines the finer things in life decide to write a positive vibe acknowledging the might of the rhyme 
 I am ash-er-roth
