Sitting on the couch with my head in my hands I need to think 
 Think fast, need to set up a plan to get big 
 Lick already said I'm the man I know this 
 But it's hard being my own fan 
 I'm so thick, thick headed when it comes to the flow 
 My secret weapon 
 Said the go cause there's no better time than 
 The present, not a second time to get a stepping 
 What's a hustle for a hustler if it's the wrong direction 
 I take a sec making all the right corrections 
 Full inspection make sure its perfected 
 Some neglected saying I'm obsessive 
 But a record ain't a record less it really is impressive 
 I've been infected with the sickness of perfectionist 
 Like if you grab a hips and twist it while your sexing it 
 It feels betta betta use of the erection 
 A free lesson, very welcome 
 Baby don't you even mention it 
 'Cause if your trying and ain't working 
 And you just don't get it and it sound well 
 Just wont flow (X2) 
 We'll recognize 
 Real you can bet cause the music 
 Come from my soul 
 From my soul 
 From my soul 
 I said the music comes from my soul 
 Sick with it games with it 
 Till the limitsey 
 Asher Rosh ain't no joke 
 Ain't no joke 
 I see the visions bigger than the big picture 
 Doing division with figures of dirt diggler 
 Weed an liqueur play the role of an addiction 
 But efflicted for the sicktion 
 I still remain a stickler 
 Slick thinker, quick picker upper 
 Bounty hunter for the runners and 
 I found about a hundred of em 
 They be dumb enough drugging them 
 With bubble gum I cover them, smuther them, 
 And then I tell their mother on em 
 Getting grounded for sounding like a 
 Clown not allowed out the house for 
 Bringing our sound down, kick out 
 Vanished from the town but bromanted 
 May be granted while they handed me 
 My crown 
 Bow down start respecting it 
 New rules in effect and you all should 
 Expected it new schools is erect 
 Ash Roth be the president 'cause I'm a 
 True perfectionist 
 'Cause if your trying and ain't working 
 And you just don't get it and it sound well 
 Just wont flow (X2) 
 We'll recognize 
 Real you can bet cause the music 
 Come from my soul 
 From my soul 
 From my soul 
 I said the music comes from my soul 
 Sick with it games with it 
 Till the limitsey 
 Asher Rosh ain't no joke 
 Ain't no joke 
 (Beanie) 
 Kiss my ring is a b mac thing 
 I'm on a road to the richest like a 
 G-rap thing 
 Young and jump from the corner 
 Then he got king 
 Look who ran through your castle 
 And scooped your queen 
 I ain't your average little rapper young 
 Scrapper, I ain't a backpacker 
 I'm an original gun clapper 
 I buck shot shorties and turning moon blacker 
 Snap like cameras in dark room rappers 
 Who arm full metal jacket 
 Niggas hambuger hell, get your potune captioned 
 You in deep water this harpoon practice 
 Your dudes is cactus, cartoon rappers 
 I draw on niggas like stick figures 
 Get the picture, I ain't easy to trace nigga 
 You should expected this from two 
 Rap perfectionist 
 'Cause if your trying and ain't working 
 And you just don't get it and it sound well 
 Just wont flow (X2) 
 We'll recognize 
 Real you can bet cause the music 
 Come from my soul 
 From my soul 
 From my soul 
 I said the music comes from my soul 
 Sick with it games with it 
 Till the limitsey 
 Asher Rosh ain't no joke 
 Ain't no joke
