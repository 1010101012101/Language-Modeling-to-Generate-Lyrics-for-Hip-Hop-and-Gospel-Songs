Hello, you can start recording me at any time 
 Yo, I got something in my... 
 I need some water and something man 
 I got something in my fuckin', in my teeth 
 Ready? All right cool 
 I'm here for the, fathers and mothers, 
 Sisters and brothers, 
 For the guilty, the innocent, citizens, and the immigrants, 
 If you ain't listen you missin' out 
 Bear witness to the realist out (I bet they listen now) 
 If my voice didn't work, but my hands could talk 
 Would you take the time to see what a def man thought? 
 I could be alone and homeless 
 Hurt won't heal, but my cardboard sign so my words are real 
 Would you stop to drop change? Or stop for a change? 
 Engage in conversation, and exchange names? 
 Or maybe you would if my image was a bitch 
 Big lips and bigger tits show you what real sex is but, 
 What if I was picked for grave? Sick for days? Aged to be sick with aids? 
 Would you listen to my story that I swear is touching, 
 Or just blank stare 'cause you're scared to touch me? 
 If I'm Jewish or Christian does it affect your decision to 
 See past religion and simply listen to wisdom? 
 Would you really listen to my views on the government 
 If my raps were democrat and yours are republican? 
 Whether I'm black or white, gay, straight, hermaphrodite, 
 Half the time trash the light and we all act alike 
 So, pass the mic, don't assist being ignorant 
 Unclench your fist for a bit and just listen
