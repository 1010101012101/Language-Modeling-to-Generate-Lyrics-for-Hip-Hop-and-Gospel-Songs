Sittin' on a trufitt 
 Puffin' on the best cut bud, tryna get but from Ms Muffet 
 Me and Teddy Rock-Spin stirrin' up a ruckus 
 Eggin' all the houses, smashin' all the pumpkins 
 Suck a dick butt kiss, chumps can't funk with the punk kids 
 Ash Roth be the king of the blumpkins 
 Any Tim Duncan spur off the moment 
 Let the whole world know I run shit 
 Jump ship quick, tell a friend that I'm dumb sick 
 Spit fungus that'll grow from a dung 
 Trip twist to a front flip, son now is some trick 
 Watch all the dumb chicks hump when I bump this 
 Kinda like the blonde Bob Saget, Ash can get nasty 
 Pass me a blunt and some Captain chillin' with an Ashley 
 Headin' to the mall, sittin' in the backseat gettin' jerked off 
 Ten feet tall with the balls of a matador 
 Door matted whore with your words heard that before 
 Poor metaphor pedicure, get your feet fixed 
 Walk in my shoes for a few, you gon' need it 
 Yeah, got your Wii fit to practice your fris with 
 Need a few weeks before you can compete with 
 Razor Ramon flow, oh so sharp 
 You can take a Palsky 
 I'ma take lark on my go-kart 
 Mario kart skills are outrageous 
 Play me any day and I'll be the best racist 
 Wait no erase it, meant to say racer 
 Traded in my cell phone for a new pager 
 Take off your bluetooth now dot com 
 I'm at the grocery store with hot moms 
 'Bout thirty five with at least two kids 
 We can make out while my friend babysits 
 All up in your fridge eating left over shit 
 Tuna sandwich, butterscotch krimpets 
 Cheetos be my choice of chips, I enjoy for a bit 
 Take a sip from my sips and then split 
 Roll up that J, is it rolled? 
 Yeah roll it up, uh 
 Hair like a troll doll, basketball shorts on 
 Yeah, I'ma dork but I'm still holdin' court, ball up, baller 
 Y'all take to long get dolled up 
 Give a fuck if I look like I just woke up 
 Who am I tryna impress? 
 Honey in the sundress with the breasts luscious 
 Just sent me a text, O M G you're the B E S 
 If you tryna have sex, I'm the best at it
