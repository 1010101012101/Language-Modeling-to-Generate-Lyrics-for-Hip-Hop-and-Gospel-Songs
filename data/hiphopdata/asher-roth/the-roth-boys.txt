And the winner is 
 Ash roth y'all 
 My man 
 Roth boys in the building tonight 
 Oh whatta feeling I'm feelin' nice 
 If you only live once 
 And there's only one life 
 Then tonight might as well be the night 
 White boy on the beat 
 How surreal is that 
 I mean forreal 
 He's the illest 
 I hate to kill the cat 
 But I am curious 
 And they deserve this shit 
 So in fury I hit 'em with the fury fist 
 Fist of fury ... and I murdered this 
 They star gazing like copernicus verdict is 
 Not guilty 
 Spit game so filthy 
 Cow girls all wanna milk me 
 He'll be pissed if he knew all the chicks 
 That I hit 
 Chicks being tracks 
 Are you sick 
 Pig headed 
 Demented 
 See men and free men 
 Need to be at least a ten to get in 
 Your entering 
 The lions den 
 Let it begin let the best man win 
 They passes on me for pittsburg slim but 
 But in the end I am thinking it was steve rifkind 
 Enough said 
 Ill accept 
 Hey steve do you have enough bread? 
 La chlim 
 That's more like it 
 But what do I know 
 I'm just a white kid 
 And that's langly 
 Hes my side kick 
 The girls cheer when we here 
 Yeah they high kick 
 And if its ball I beat ... 
 ... Hurts like it my shit 
 Shots clock non stop 
 Put it in there eye socket 
 This is routine like outfeild ipod 
 I eat my breakfast at ihop 
 Scotch on the rocks 
 Look at me with their eyes cocked 
 Gosh this is nuts 
 Ain't nothin' I Have Seen In A While 
 Wow this is wild even I'm shocked 
 So damn good didn't know I could 
 Feel a rick flare 
 Coming on can I hear it 
 Whoooo 
 The nature boy in the building tonight 
 Oh whatta feeling I'm feelin' nice 
 You ain't even gotta bring your boyfriend out 
 It's the party of the year we dancing on the couch 
 Let you hair down baby 
 Let it go 
 Figure what jigga figured than figure more 
 Figga jigga bigga 'cause he didn't know 
 But when has a jigga decision ever gone gold 
 Let the trumpets blow 
 Blow and behold for those who don't know 
 Ash roth in the biulding to night 
 Oh what a feeling I'm feeling nice 
 You ain't even gotta bring your boyfriend out 
 We can turn the lights off 
 And play whos in your mouth 
 Been at peace since I moved down south 
 To the a to the s to the h and we out 
 Yeah we down south laughin' 
 Like yes that just happened 
 Now that's what I call rappin' 
 You half ass cats with your hallway pass 
 You ain't aloud out get back to class 
 I'm kicking ass and takin' names 
 This is the same thing that happened on renagade 
 I came in to enterain 
 And ain't neva afraid 
 Saying enything 
 Oh imma be gettin' paid 
 Obama for president in 2008 
 The roth boys in the building tonight 
 Oh what a feeling I'm feeling nice 
 If you only live once 
 And there's only one life 
 Then tonight might as well be to night 
 Might as well be tonight 
 Might as well be tonight 
 Might as well be to night
