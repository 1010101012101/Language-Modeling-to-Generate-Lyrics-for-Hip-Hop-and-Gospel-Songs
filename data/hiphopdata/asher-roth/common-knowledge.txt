They say that if it works, don't fix it 
 Go against the law, might get a bit risky 
 No offense to y'all, but I feel a bit gifted 
 So I think my odds are about 50/50, crispy 
 O.K. Corral, we about to put it down 
 Take 10 and turn around, go and pull your pistols out but 
 What is this about, all these grenades and handguns 
 Magnús Ver Magnússon, strong set of hands, son 
 Talk, dark, handsome, holding y'all for ransom 
 Strong arm Lance so scared that he can't run 
 'Cause when a man comes face to face with his fear 
 He gets weird, he can't hear, he can't see things clear 
 I be sincere, yes dear, guests here 
 Press gear, dress queers, fresh in my neck beard 
 Next year, net year, jet Lear, get near 
 Top tier, drop tears, no way not here 
 Cause there's no crying in baseball, and that's that 
 There'll always be a case call when Ash rap 
 Bars will take your face off, no cat scratch 
 Go ahead, ask wreck racks on racks, yeah that 
 For a pat on the back, after I black tackles 
 Fat on cat but I'm packed for my breath 
 Climb the ladder of success, skipping and missing a step 
 New edition of spittin', you should've listened to Flex 
 It's like... 
 I try to tell them but they don't know 
 I try to tell them but they don't know 
 I try to tell them but they don't know, oh, no 
 I try to tell them but they don't know 
 I try to tell them but they don't know 
 I try to tell them but they don't know, oh, no 
 Slick Dickies, no one can stay with me 
 Spit it out quick, as soon as the shit hits me 
 Kill swiftly, been ill since Stick Stickly 
 Double dip dibs, I dibble and bust quickies 
 Nifty little shit, I do it while dressed thrifty 
 Pricks just stiff, my stick is so shifty 
 Sick, Fred McGriff with the hits coming lefty 
 Used to be for free, now the seats never empty 
 It's elementary, yeah I heard it in assembly 
 Principal was telling me I'd better go ahead and read 
 Never be a better me, better off dead or me 
 Not really a better but I bettin' that I better be 
 Better with the rhetoric, set it up and let it rip 
 I Better forget it man, kid's a fucking lunatic 
 Looney Toon, lunar eclipse 
 Every blue moon, might see a few shooting strips
