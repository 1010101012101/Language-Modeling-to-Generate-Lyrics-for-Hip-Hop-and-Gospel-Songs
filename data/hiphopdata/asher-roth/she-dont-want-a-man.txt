She don't want a man 
 She just wanna dance, let's dance 
 Quiet and confident, not a bit I'm the shit 
 Screamin' ow out loud, right now I'm the shit 
 Let 'em know, let it go, feelin' sexy, feelin' grown 
 I'll be sippin' on patron mixed with pineapple 
 As she looks up, spots me only for a sec 
 But in that moment our eyes lock 
 I swear that we had sex and in that tank top 
 Tight jeans, high heels, nice teeth 
 Oh, I think she likes me but but it be unlikely 
 Ain't lookin' for no man, man 
 Really just came to dance, dance 
 On the dance floor 
 Know you wanna really, really 
 On the dance floor 
 I just came to party, party 
 Ain't lookin' for romance, mance 
 Really just came to dance, dance 
 On the dance floor 
 Know you wanna really, really 
 On the dance floor 
 I just came to party, party 
 She don't want a man, man, man, man, man 
 She just wants to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance 
 She don't want a man, man 
 She just wants to dance on the dance floor 
 On the dance floor, on the dance floor 
 I see Boyder and ask him, yo can you take her fat friend? 
 He laughs and then digs in, hell yeah, I'll be your wing man 
 We two step, we groovin', we dancin', we movin' 
 The crowd weave through it, people gettin' real stupid 
 Check my breath and my sweat on my chest and my pits 
 Yeah, I'm fresh, supa fresh, I would do me in a sec 
 'Bout to get my dance on, so I put my hands on 
 And she frowns, turns around, with a look like 
 Ain't lookin' for no man, man 
 Really just came to dance, dance 
 On the dance floor 
 Know you wanna really, really 
 On the dance floor 
 I just came to party, party 
 Ain't lookin' for romance, mance 
 Really just came to dance, dance 
 On the dance floor 
 Know you wanna really, really 
 On the dance floor 
 I just came to party, party 
 She don't want a man, man, man, man, man 
 She just wants to dance, dance, dance, dance, dance 
 She don't want a man, man 
 She just wants to dance on the dance floor 
 On the dance floor, on the dance floor 
 Well, you need to cool down 'cause I'm way too hot 
 Too hot, too hot, too hot, too hot 
 Girl, you need to cool out 'cause you not 
 That hot, that hot, that hot, that hot, that hot 
 See I'm just tryin' to cool down 'cause I'm way 
 Too hot, too hot, too hot, too hot, too hot 
 Girl, you need to cool out 'cause you not that hot 
 I'm just playin', I'm just hatin', I know you way too hot 
 Ain't lookin' for no man, man 
 Really just came to dance, dance 
 On the dance floor
