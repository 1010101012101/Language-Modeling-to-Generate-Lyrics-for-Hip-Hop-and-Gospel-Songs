So while we're waiting 
 (Waiting) waiting on the world to change, We keep on waiting 
 (Waiting) waiting on the world to change 
 It's not that we don't care, 
 We just know that the fight ain't fair 
 So we keep on waiting 
 (Waiting) Waiting on the world to change 
 Yeah they say we got no motive 
 Just pot smoking dope, without hope for us to grow into grown ups, 
 But I plan to show em' the I know it when I'm not smoking weed 
 I have reason to believe 
 There are people that are descent, 
 Achieve to succeed they read to decrease the ignorant significant of cutting down the trees, 
 Recycling recyclables that help break the cycle of what's rightfully destroying the world, 
 I want to tell the boys and girls the future of our earth we're hurting the world with every second that we burn, 
 Unlearning what we learned at birth to be a good person, 
 Respect is what we deserve but first we must earn it, and in this earnest we turn things around put our hand out and pull it off the ground, until then we can all do the same, I'll be right here waiting on the world to change 
 And we're still waiting 
 Waiting on the world to change 
 We keep on waiting waiting on the world to change 
 One day our generation 
 Is gonna rule the population 
 So we keep on waiting 
 Waiting on the world to change 
 We keep on waiting 
 Waiting on the world to change
