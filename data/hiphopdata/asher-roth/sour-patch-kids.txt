Use the eyes of the owl 
 The Sour Patch Kids got me out of wack 
 And out of gas 
 The hour glass spills as I'm left on the vasey without a vest 
 Lost my train of thought 
 My brain can not be bought 
 Trained to trainicle auberate with authority (no way jose) 
 The chay in may (revolutionary) 
 To the leaders I am scary 
 I. Pose a threat to those who get to close for comfort 
 And won't conform 
 Come forward 
 Sworn on my unborn son if there is one more war I will come for, thee 
 Poor get poor, the rich just get richer 
 Get the jist? 
 You see the big picture? 
 China's ditched from a shake on the Richter 
 Mother earth shrugs and we all get evicted 
 This some sick shit 
 Slightly twisted 
 Information from our nations capital 
 Capital is all the captain calls for 
 They just want more (and more) 
 And more (and more) 
 And more (and more) 
 And more (and more) 
 And more (and more) 
 (I don't hear you) 
 Take me away 
 Take me away from here 
 Take me away from evil 
 I don't hear you 
 Can you turn it up just a little bit? 
 Can you turn it up? Can you turn it up 
 My people crying, and be dying, they be dining in the islands, 
 Drinking wine with their wives like everything is fine 
 Denying that they fightin for their lives, 
 Every night to survive since the beginning of time 
 Aye-yai-yai 
 Can't believe the evil that feeds off this so called American dream 
 Lies and deceit make all the Americans seem 
 Like blood-sucking money hungry fiends 
 But money doesn't mean. A damn thing to me 
 I just want to be. I want to be free 
 But unfortunately a fortune is what you need 
 Cause the fortune 500's run the country 
 It's one company 
 If your not accompanied 
 Would you mind grabbing me a cup of tea? 
 If we go hungry, in our own country 
 I wonder what's it's like living in Hungary 
 Yeah, it isn't funny, but its coming 
 It's about to get ugly 
 Streets turn to a game of rugby 
 Y'all don't hear me tho 
 Take me away 
 Take me away from here 
 Take me away from evil 
 I don't hear you 
 Can you turn it up just a little bit? 
 Can you turn it up? Can you turn it up 
 We're buying bubbly and make it rain 100's 
 Is it just me or is that some dumbshit 
 Yo what the fuck hoe come 
 Little dumbshit 
 Let's go (I know you can think of something) 
 Donate your dollars, raise a dollar 
 Help a mother, save a father 
 Cause poverty is probably our biggest problem 
 And it ain't gonna stop with Obama 
 To save the world we must start at the bottom 
 Take me away 
 Take me away from here 
 Take me away from evil 
 I don't hear you 
 I don't hear you 
 I don't hear you 
 I don't hear you 
 I don't hear you 
 ... 
 I don't hear you (repeat till it fades out)
