"Might be the most slept on the world 
 Saying all this cool shit just get ignored like: 
 'Word white boy, whatever dude forget it. 
 I hope you learned your lesson, no one pays you no attention' 
 No longer fielding questions, go cancel all my sessions 
 I'm giving up fuck it, they all got the wrong impression 
 Bench players getting all the minutes since I left em' 
 Shooting every second but can't even even hit the net?man 
 These listeners be missing the original 
 Mr.invincible knows no-limit like I'm mystikal 
 Hit the bowl, hit the road, headed out to rip a show 
 Make em' flip the lid, explode the heads of those who didn't know 
 Trespassin' on asher's grass maggot 
 I'm a cracker wrapped black, half and half (Lenny Kravitz) 
 And yeah I'm passionate when it comes to this rap shit 
 So I can't stand when all the rappers kick whack shit 
 Like dat kid better off chewing cactus 
 Going run laps homie, go on home and practice 
 'Ash don't be mad that you took a leave of absence 
 And since your last track all these other kids have cashed in' 
 Well now I'm back, thanks for keeping my seat warm 
 Rapping don't work out, better go and join the peace corps 
 He's sore, don't give a fuck about your week boy 
 Tell me how's it feel to be just another decoy? 
 Rejoice yeah the heats back up on it 
 House done rented, time to pack up tenants 
 Rejoice yeah the heats back up on it 
 House done rented, time to pack up tenants"
