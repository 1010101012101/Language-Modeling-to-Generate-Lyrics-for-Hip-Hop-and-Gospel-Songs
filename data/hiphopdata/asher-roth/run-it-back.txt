Run it back, run it back, motherfucker..., run it back, 
 Go and tell the whole world that their under an attack, 
 No this isn't iraq this is more like I'm rapping, 
 Asher be the baddest on the atlas it's a fact, umm, 
 Last one that leave and the first one to be here, 
 Rolling on the joint, I'll be sipping on a ... year, 
 Eh, I, I hear it goes, I've been floating in the clouds and got lost up in the moment, 
 Oh shit, yeah I know you got mixed emotions, 
 No bitch I ain't going nowhere so quit, 
 Got new fans that be catchin up on old s*** 
 Throwing couple of bowls then I'm going for a throat kick, 
 Toe tip, on my tippy toes I am close yeah, so kid, 
 All my hippy flow let it soak in, token ... 
 Lord of the rings I am the volcan, molten ... 
 Yeah you're my volcano smoking, holdin',

 Hoes Going down on me, deep throatin, oh shit, 
 Keep it PG for the most but, when I'm on tour know that everybody goes like... 
 U hu hu hoo, turn the motherfucker up X 2 
 Coming back, coming back motherfuck..., coming back 
 Ain't nobody ever told me that I didn't burn no track 
 White or black, does it matter, all that matter can he rap 
 Can he last, can he past 
 Every itsy bitsy test 
 Every city that he be in ... with the best 
 Little kitties try to get him but they catch it in the chest 
 Punch lines to the neck, crunch time I'm impressed 
 I am better, I am better, just in case you couldn't guess 
 Yes ... I am merchant of the birds 
 ... Of the music be emerging from the burbs 
 Man I got some nerves I will never go and ... 
 I encourage you to ... but you following the herd 
 Server of the murder, murder server is my work 
 Put me in the middle and the watch them ... 
 Circle is the circus and is certainly my term 
 But by the time I'm finished you can tell that I am ... 
 Cause ... 
 U hu, turn the motherfucker X 2
