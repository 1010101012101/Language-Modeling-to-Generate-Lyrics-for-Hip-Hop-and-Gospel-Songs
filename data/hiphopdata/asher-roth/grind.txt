Yeah, yeah, yo, yo, this one's for the people 
 All the B's that'll bleed and they sleep and they eat 
 Shit, breathe the thought we all equal 
 Ain't a man on the God's green pea underneath any other 
 I don't wanna play preacher 
 But, but I swear they turn their ear when we talk about peace and love 
 Sometimes might need a hug, yeah 
 We all wanna come on up above 
 But this ain't about Jesus 
 No way, no Abe, no Ike, Moses, or Mohammed 
 Yeah, it's all about believing, full steam ahead 
 Because I know the worst times are behind me 
 I don't wanna sound cheesy but, but, but 
 It's just I really mean it, eh, eh, yeah 
 I'm tellin' I can feel it, eh, eh 
 It's the reason I don't sleep, I'll be way too geeked tonight 
 This one's for all of y'all 
 I'm the same as all of y'all, I'm on my shit 
 I work real hard and all for every little bit that I get 
 But this is all I need, so sing this song with me 
 It goes like 
 So it sounds like this 
 E'rybody start clapping your hands 
 It's like, it's like 
 I, I've been on my grind 
 I can only grind 
 For so long 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go 
 I, I've been on my grind 
 I can only grind 
 For so long 
 'Bout time to change a few things 
 We enslaved to the bank and we only wanna buy new shoes 
 The way that we think we can do anything that 
 We really wanna put our minds to 
 The American dream, ddream is a pyramid scheme, scheme 
 And it feels outta reach 
 When it's hard and the times are tough 
 But change starts with us, yep, yep 
 We all want freedom, yeah, to be who we be 
 I don't wanna be afraid when I speak to say what I'm feeling 
 Yeah, together we're strong 
 But divided never been so weak 
 It's time we get even, yeah, yeah 
 And really what I mean is, is, is 
 This change I can feel it, yeah, yeah 
 Mr. President, I think it's all gonna be okay 
 This one's for all of y'all 
 I'm the same as all of y'all, I'm on my shit 
 I work real hard and all for every little bit that I get 
 But this is all I need, so sing this song with me 
 It goes like 
 So it sounds like this 
 E'rybody start clapping your hands 
 It's like, it's like 
 I, I've been on my grind 
 I can only grind 
 For so long 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go 
 I, I've been on my grind 
 I can only grind 
 For so long 
 So it's not about fame and fortune 
 It's about believing and believing in yourself 
 And understanding that this life is life 
 It's liberty and the pursuit of happiness 
 And happiness isn't about 
 Getting what you want all the time 
 It's about loving what you have 
 So get ready it's a new day 
 I, I've been on my grind 
 I can only grind 
 For so long
