My girl wants to, my girl wants to my girl wants to party all the time 
 Party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to party all the time 
 Party all the time, party all the time, yeah 
 My girl, she drinks and smokes 
 Then she goes to fashion shows 
 Forth and back, back and forth 
 Takes the, uh, just like a pro 
 Try to keep on up with her but really, why bother 
 Girl's a super hottie plus she parties way harder 
 Still looking great with no makeup on 
 Keep going strong 'til the break of dawn 
 Eighth to the face, take it straight no chase 
 When she stay to the pace, ain't a damn thing wrong 
 Mother, sister, brother, they insist on drinking water 
 But she's sipping on some liquor 
 Janice Dickinson had taught her well 
 Hammered, you can hardly tell 
 Stammered but she hides it well 
 Hands up in the air and yells, party all the time 
 She dance around me in her thong 
 Sing along, favorite song 
 Rip a shot, hit the bong 
 Going all night long 
 Party all the time, party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to 
 Sorry little Barbie who can hardly take a sip 
 Yeah, my chick be drinking whiskey just to chase it with a kiss 
 Then she'll charge it to her card, whole bar, plus tip 
 Yeah, for her and all her friends 'cause she never pays for shit 
 Kind of chick that you see on the TV, yeah 
 Real high heels and her cleavage, yeah 
 Rolling up some homegrown asking 
 Can we smoke some weed in here 
 Isn't like she needed it but got diamonds and pearls 
 And definitely ain't a lesbian but kisses other girls 
 Drives a car that isn't hers, keeps the keys up in her purse 
 Lipstick, red or pink, tell me which do you prefer 
 Mini-skirts exotic furs wanna make the kitten purr 
 Try to go and buy a drink but split before you finish yours, 'cause she 
 Party all the time, party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to, parties all the time, shorty she a dime 
 Ass like Nicki, Barbie in her prime 
 Stripping on that pole, shorty on her grind 
 I meet her in the bathroom, dog her from behind 
 It's the red cup sipping, Ciroc boy mixing 
 Bottles of that peach got that pussy all dripping 
 Line was down the street, room full of bad bitches 
 Everybody super wasted and them hoes is mad twisted 
 Asher Roth passed her off 
 I had to ball, that ass was soft 
 I dribbled all on it like basketball 
 She nibbled all on it, I smashed, I'm gone 
 It last through the morning and on through the night 
 11 a.m., I was off to a flight 
 Land in your city it's all of the lights 
 I got them hoes rolling like all of the dice 
 Party all the time, party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time, party all the time 
 My girl wants to
