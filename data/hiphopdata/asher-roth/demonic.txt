I see you, the hottest thing up on the floor, 
 The way she moves got me wantin more, 
 Drink in my hand, DJ play my song, 
 Got me feelin' good I'm about to get it on, 
 I can't explain I'm in the mood the way you do the things you do, 
 She got the look she got the moves, she got it ooh she demonic 
 On the dance floor she transforms, the way that she moves put a trance on you, 
 Ooh can I put my hands on you, there's not much that I won't do 
 Its no secret I want ya girl you're my mantre girl free aren't ya girl 
 I'm at your mercy girl don't hurt me girl got a bad case of a devil worshiper... 
 Nah nah nah hold up hold up hold up 
 I'm on my way in rap, ain't no girl gettin' in the way of that, 
 I want my name on plaques on stage I'm phased I'm a dangerous actaaa 
 Strange as that little ash blew up got famous fastaaa 
 But fame is wack, I came here to change it, take it back 
 Cause the way we act and the way we rap yeah its maniac, satanic practically 
 We want change then changed we have to be 
 You see me I speak proactively and back it up with the things I do 
 Everything we do we should think it through, yeah I seek the truth then I seek the booth 
 Yeah I deep my roots to speak to you yeah the scenic route I take for inspiration 
 Converse with nature relay information, its different its intimidation 
 But its new ways we are integration 
 This is it this be the disc good for the soul, safe for the kids, 
 A to the s h to the e r you ready for the greenhouse effect
