(Asher Roth) 
 That's what my body's telling me 
 In the morning 
 My hormones are just everywhere 
 In the a.m. 
 I like to call it morning do 
 Its morning do 
 (Don Cannon) 
 Lets go 
 (Asher Roth - Verse 1) 
 In the a.m? girl I'd be getting 
 No shit my dick be hard as a brick 
 Girl I ain't kiddin' ill really be feelin' it 
 Might just stick it between your legs 
 I like my ass sunny side up 
 I like my ass sun is risin' 
 On top real fast she'd be ridin' 
 Burnin' house down like I'm andre rison 
 Hell yeah, ill suck on titties 
 Wrap my arms round her 'cause she's skinny 
 Come on baby, let's get busy 
 You know how many want to hit me? 
 There's so many, good and plenty 
 Chew them up and eat them every morning 
 It's my favorite to have sex morning do 
 I like to walk around naked (naked) 
 While my girl cook breakfast (breakfast) 
 She's making eggs and bacon (bacon) 
 I got the recipe, did you want me and me on you 
 Its 8 a.m. with no phones on, your so damn cute (your so damn cute) 
 I kiss your neck you rub your thighs 
 I'll feed you through (I'll feed you through) 
 We sexin' in the morning 
 It's the morning do (morning do) 
 Its morning 
 I'm playin' in bed 
 And dreaming about boxin' 
 That's when I start to feel a hand on my cock 
 She whispers in my ear "ash I feel hot, I know it's kinda early can I climb on top?" 
 Hell yeah, I would like that a lot 
 Let's try a new position, let's hit the g spot, 
 She groanin' and she moanin' and screamin' don't stop! 
 She leans and tries to kiss me I'll say "shit your breathes hot." 
 So kissin's out the question, but you know that hands hot 
 I'll sunk your tires stammin' I'm overhand now 
 I overhand slap that booty 
 Watch you wiggle watch it jiggle, 
 Watch she stop what she doin' just to giggle 
 Blow the whistle, (whistle blows) and the regulation 
 Overtime starts, after eggs and bacon 
 Yeah.
