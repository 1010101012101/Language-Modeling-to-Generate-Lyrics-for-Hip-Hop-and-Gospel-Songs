Greenhouse Effect 2 
 Shout out to Justin Bieber 
 Chris Brown What up! 
 Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck 
 They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up 
 Go go 
 Go go 
 Go go 
 Go go 
 Here I go 
 Yeah yo, what's the scenario? 
 Can't understand, what you staring for? 
 Like you've never seen a white boy dance before, but 
 Damn she fine 
 That's one chick I can stand behind 
 Play in my field like a dandelion 
 Put it all on 'til you can't decide 
 What's it gon' be? 
 You, me, her, her, her, you, me 
 Girl, go beserk, gotta beat 'em with a tree 
 Go ahead, fall back, (?) boy gon' breathe 
 Ease off, back up, I'm about to act up 
 Floating, sipping, having fun, cause I be young and acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up 
 Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck 
 They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up

 So I walked in the club with a dope hairdo 
 Checking my fresh, everything brand new 
 Sexy old dude, saying "who's you?" 
 You do me, and I'm a do you 
 What what, what you talkin about with it 
 Man fall back, I'm just chillin' 
 Hate when they check for a bad-bad bitch 
 Gotta have respect for my bad habits 
 P-p, now pass me the tree 
 I'm a get wild, I'm a nail you to me 
 Pull out the camera and shoot me a links 
 Cause I'm a act up, sweetie pie, what you think? 
 Go insane in the membrane, (?) 
 (?) slang, come and hang with a real name 
 (?) 
 Badder than a m-, MJ level 
 Face down, ass up, skinnys on, dirty Chucks 
 Showing off, I'm a swag it up 
 Good girl gone bad, grab my bud 
 Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck 
 They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up

 19 year old and I gotta act up 
 Cause I'm so so fly, yeah I'm so fly 
 And I don't know why, really know I, go so wow, till the bass goes oh my 
 Oh I, I gotta slow it down 
 Yeah I'm on the loose, and I won't stop now 
 Cause I go so loud, and I go so wow 
 So you better watch out cause I'm oh so ahh 
 I'm on some risky business 
 I like women and French kisses 
 Mama told do the dishes but I'm here catching fishes 
 Cause I'm still young and acting up 
 Girls on my mind, so I still mack up 
 They see the money, see the money, rack up, till the walls dark green, cause I'm stacking up 
 Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck 
 They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up 
 (Chris Brown) 
 Yikes, I guess I'm macking up 
 I'm about to go in, let me wrap it up 
 Young old school like Gallagher 
 But I'm a call these shots, caliber 
 What it is JB, my Ray-Bans in my jacket might give you rabies 
 My chain heavy, give it to the ladies 
 Hold up, hold up, watch 'em go crazy 
 Chilling with Asher Roth 
 Girls let me touch, cause their ass is soft 
 Yes I'm a score with them basketballs 
 She gon' give it up, I don't pass at all 
 My crew neck match my two-step 
 I just had group sex on my new jet 
 So many pretty girl, I'm like "who's next?" 
 So drunk all my white friends like, "Do it!" 
 Jeans off, back up, I'm about to act up 
 Smoking, drinking, having fun, cause I be young and acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up 
 Bass loud, hands up, I don't really give a fuck 
 They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 Acting, acting up 
 They say I ain't old enough but I be young and acting up
