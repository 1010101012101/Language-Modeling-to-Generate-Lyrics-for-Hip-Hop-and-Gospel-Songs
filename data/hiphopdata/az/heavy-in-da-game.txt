(Feat. Consequence) 
 (One million, two million, three million, four) 
 First off, it's the first in the loft 
 First to peel off in that pretty little Porsche 
 Pretty little women with their skin so soft 
 And that triple beige linen stay big enough, New York 
 You know them haters goin' talk 
 And do what they do so a player can't floss 
 Well motherfucker I'm a boss 
 Fix boy, hustler, slimmer Rick Ross 
 So don't get it criss crossed 
 I'm a bit pissed off but the wrist still frost (word) 
 Neck all chipped up, kicks still cost 
 I leave foreign change, I done catered out the range (uh huh) 
 Me and you the same, homie, get it out your brain 
 South beach with it out and did it out of Spain (Spain) 
 Was never heavy with the fame 
 But the name still bang 'cause I'm heavy in the game 
 Yessir I'm heavy in the game (hey) 
 I get mine and you better do the same (hey) 
 If not then you're only in the way (hey) 
 'Cause this time (hey) I'm heavy in the game (hey) 
 Yessir I'm heavy in the game (hey) 
 I get mine and you better do the same (hey) 
 If not (hey) then you're only in the way (hey) 
 'Cause this time (hey) I'm heavy in the game (hey) 
 (Come on) 
 Different breed, different needs 
 To newin' in Nova 'cotia, mixin' weed 
 Infused to Costa Nostra, this is me 
 B-K-A-Z-H and I see (come on) 
 And I ain't here to hurt nobody 
 I'm just here to watch chicks work their body, and 
 Back somethin' like Laila Ali, and 
 Head back to the hotel lobby, and 
 Louis V, jewlery 
 Who else could it be homie, who but me 
 Fresh prince of the projects, kumodee 
 With my Tom Ford shades and I'm up North ways (word) 
 I'm just tryin' behave 
 Tryin' get it how I get it till I'm finally paid (yes) 
 Yes I'm finally made 
 Joe Pesci in Casino I can honestly say 
 Yessir I'm heavy in the game (hey) 
 I get mine and you better do the same (hey) 
 If not then you're only in the way (hey) 
 'Cause this time (hey) I'm heavy in the game (hey) 
 Yessir I'm heavy in the game (hey) 
 I get mine and you better do the same (hey) 
 If not (hey) then you're only in the way (hey) 
 'Cause this time (hey) I'm heavy in the game (hey) 
 So at this point, in the (uh) major is insignifigant 
 It's all about the Cons' and the way that I be rippin' shit 
 'Cause I moved on from the fools I did business with 
 There ain't no hard feelin's like I just became impotent 
 Now they take to him, like valleys in California 
 Come what you want, fire, that's when the hold is on you 
 I'll still be on the corner and I feel no shame 
 'Cause I bet you they goin' kick it like 
 When you're field goal range 
 So if you don't know the name of the killer you see 
 Let me spell it out for you like a kid at a bee 
 See I gotta get mine, no matter the consequences 
 That's why they fill the kid like one of the five senses 
 The Wire raise the question about my demographic 
 When everybody knows that my demo was a classic 
 I'm in the drivers seat like chauffeur the traffic 
 So you don't want to drive with the Cons' you bastards 
 Yessir I'm heavy in the game (hey) 
 I get mine and you better do the same (hey) 
 If not (hey) then you're only in the way (hey) 
 'Cause this time (hey) I'm heavy in the game (hey) 
 Yessir I'm heavy in the game (hey) 
 I get mine and you better do the same (hey) 
 If not (hey) then you're only in the way (hey) 
 'Cause this time (hey) I'm heavy in the game (yo!)
