Sunshine - we hustle to the moon light 
 Reminisce on a good time 
 Cop come on boget.2x 
 Yo when times get trifle 
 I'm subjected to street survival 
 See many never complete they cycle 
 Other retreat to bibles, living holy 
 But currency seem to control me, moving coldly 
 In the presence of old parolies 
 My mind mold me, keep me in mack mode like Goldie 
 Police know me, but ain't got enough to hold me 
 I follow rules, through the knowledge, swallow jewels 
 A form of teaching, from the streets never taught in school 
 You caught you lose, a wise man utilize tools 
 Solitude certifies all moves 
 So I walk this path of the old dread, that lead me off the Ave 
 Absorbing fast, learning from niggaz I lost in the past 
 Its poison plays in these foul days 
 Housing cops and they foul ways, I'm walking through a wild maze 
 Holding my brain trying to maintain 
 Sleet hell, snow, or rain, I guess the game will never change. 
 Sunshine - we hustle to the moon light 
 Reminisce on a good time 
 Cop come on boget.2x 
 Since the genesis, paraphernalia circle my premises 
 Poor images, project life drained my innocence 
 It's all the worst genocide, I guess the water's cursed 
 My old earth identify, though her soul is for the church 
 She prayed for peace, hoping I'm saved before she lay deceased 
 To say the least, the one to wise to play the streets 
 I know the ropes, certain niggaz to slow to cope 
 & Though I sold some Coke, it was only to stay afloat 
 Amongst the frozen hearted, some bending, some departed 
 Inhaling chocolate, tracing back to where it started 
 The Crack wave 2 for 5, deuce and trays 
 The Mack sprays, puffin' lye, truth and days 
 & Though it sound ill, through all the foul shit, I'm down still 
 All around real, rough is the grounds in Brownsville 
 I know the ledge, meditating, holding my head 
 Eyes red, it's "Doe or Die" till I'm dead. 
 Sunshine - we hustle to the moon light
