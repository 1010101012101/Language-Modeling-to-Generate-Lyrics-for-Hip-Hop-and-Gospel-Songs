Yeah, it's the ghost SP 
 The G-O-D AZ 
 SP, it's the ghost SP 
 With the G-O-D AZ 
 SP, it's the ghost SP 
 With the G-O-D AZ 
 Hardest yeah, hardest 
 Yeah, it's the hardest out 
 I'm a die for my cause, take the martyr route 
 Up north they talk about me when the yard is out 
 Can't come through the hood 
 On the mountain bike, when cars is out 
 It's the G-H-O-S-T go in 
 I'm the P-H-A-N-T-O-M, Phantom 
 Spit Jems blow hems from his chin to his eyebrow 
 Trying to watching beat street and wild style 
 Get the feeling back 
 Whateva happen to realer rap 
 Ask my man where the tequila at 
 I'm from a hood where they peel ya cap 
 And you ain't got a prize under 
 Word to the hoodie that my eyes under 
 Word to the hand that the gloves over 
 It's all hate when the loves over 
 Talk straight when thug sober 
 But keep it quiet, just shush 
 When you see me blowing kush on the push 
 Trying to get large dough 
 Ghost Sosa and Large Pro 
 Why you think I got on my cargos? 
 To put mad stacks in it 
 I burn your house with the plaques in it 
 And then I'm spraying the mac in it 
 Your DJ is wack, burn his house with the wax in it 
 Never kick raps if you ain't got facts in it 
 But regardless whatever your bars is 
 I don't give a fuck 'cause I be the hardest nigga 
 I'm T-H-E-H-R-D-E-S-T you don't wanna see SP 
 Everyday I wake up it's like I'm liable to sin 
 Smoke haze in bible paper swallowing gin 
 I'm G-H-O-S-T 
 I can crack the ground and make the clouds come down 
 Find me if you looking for trouble 
 Send a hundred niggas I'm a bust a thousand rounds 
 The streets is mine 
 The east just fine 
 We drop jewels in our verbal 
 We reach the blind 
 We badu with the earth food 
 Delete the swine 
 Nine two how we murk you it's reaper time 
 No riffing 
 Death is near the checks is cleared 
 'Bout to charge niggas holes for they reckless stares 
 'Bout to bar niggas flows 'cause they rep ain't there 
 They style is trash 
 The more cash, the less I care 
 I'm colder, real vulgar 
 Kill bill with the blue steel in the holster 
 Come no closer 
 Got the game in a choka blunt smoker 
 Pretty hair cunt stroker it's Brooklyn baby 
 Motherfuckers thought bush was crazy kill'em all 
 My marriage to the streets was annulled, I'm a ball 
 From the era where the real niggas ball took cheddar 
 Broads even look much better I put pleasure 
 And stitch in every word, I'm the sickest eva heard 
 If you can't get me richer, I'm a kick you to the curb 
 Picture getting served on a yacht with orderve 
 While the block still rock twenty g's by the third 
 That's my word 
 I'm T-H-E-H-R-D-E-S-T y'all don't wanna see AZ 
 At any given minute nigga liable to flip 
 You wanna pimp nigga find you a bitch I ain't the one 
 I'm SOS that's me 
 Got a hundred hungry goons that'll kill for free 
 Same young nigga that'll torch your face 
 Suite up and come support at your wake motherfucker 
 Yeah, it's the ghost SP 
 The G-O-D AZ 
 SP, it's the ghost SP 
 With the G-O-D AZ 
 SP, it's the ghost SP 
 With the G-O-D AZ 
 Hardest yeah, hardest
