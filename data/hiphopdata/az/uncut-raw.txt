No need for Lato's, pure straight out Bolivia 
 Peru, uncut baby, what? 
 Life is a struggle, that's why niggas I know stay on the juggle 
 Some hustle to double, others hug you to mug you 
 Poverty-stricken, they even turn a church kid into stickin 
 It seems sickenin, but what? Whatever makes the pockets thickin 
 Fuck police and no remorse for the beasts 
 That's lost on the streets, that pistol whip a priest for a crosspiece 
 Some lost sheep, runnin' through strips, thinkin' of top dealers 
 Fillin Tek clips, wit 'cop killers' that could stop gorillas 
 Shovin a stubnose in buttholes, I'm nutso 
 Skitzo, clepto, killin' shit up throughout the metro 
 My thug essence will always keep me plugged with drug investments 
 Sketch my reference, takin' papers considered preference 
 And violations will lead to kidnappin, decapitation 
 So what you're facin, is realism that's in activation 
 Livin' off land with five honeys playin' my hand 
 Me and fam, sippin off Guinness stout and eatin clams 
 It's all part of plans, a vet chillin' in Tamps, West and Stans 
 Outta state connect, slugs, sex, drugs and grands 
 What? For my Height niggas (Uncut) 
 Trife niggas (Raw), 25-to-life niggas 
 This is as, pure as opium, purified for street players to open em 
 Space, like three els laced with coke in em 
 Shots awoken em, fake uniform takes the portion of 
 Six trips, to young clips and killers coachin em 
 However though, fake ass niggas'll never know 
 'Cause my method's perfected, I'm movin sceptic and never show 
 I'm soon to blow, stack doe, lay on the low 
 While I'm sippin Cristal, I mess with Long Island and Moe 
 A part of nature, me wan' acres in Jamaica 
 Puffin exotic trees without seeds rolled up in leaf paper 
 So exhale, 'cause if I don't live to tell 
 Then fuck it, if well, I'll see the rest of y'all niggas in hell 
 So all my good fellas, heroin, coke and weed sellers 
 What the fuck cats can tell us if they ain't got bread to bail us? 
 Happy to survive, I haven't seen it all, Peter pay Paul 
 From the connivers to the livest, they crack fool 
 It's all war, the streets are filled up with guns galore 
 Plenty young for war, gettin' their minds flunked and sore 
 Yo dun, cock the 4... 
 Motherfuckers think we're playin', back 'em down 
 Holdin' niggas for high stitches, what? What?
