Big boy shit, you dig 
 Up in the wolves where the deer's run free 
 Kevlar fire, streets get low key 
 Ferragamo attire, preach and pope free 
 Sprinkle in the air, not a wrinkle in my gear 
 Got my girl wide open, see the twinkle in her stare 
 Valley stream water, got that valley clean aura 
 Puffin' Cali green, when I steam I'ma cough-a 
 Copin' with the game, got me loc'in' at the rain 
 Lettin' off rifles, vocalin' my name 
 Postin' in the grain, hear the callin' of the wild 
 See the birds in the air, hear the bears on the prowl 
 Chillin' like a villain, got them mirrors on my ceilin' 
 Pillow top on the bed, takin' shots to the head 
 Flat screen vision, it's that happy king's livin' 
 Far from the stars and the bars and the prisons 
 Being where I'm from, I was told when I was young 
 Do it big at least once before it's all said and done 
 Work hard just to chill, want the house on the hill 
 Wanna spouse with the clout, move out when I feel 
 Do what I want, lay around in my trunks 
 Get a smooth good run 'fore it's all said and done 
 Work hard just to chill, want the house on the hill 
 Wanna spouse with the clout, move out when I feel 
 Do what I want, lay around in my trunks 
 Get a smooth good run 'fore it's all said and done 
 It's so much more when you chillin' by the shore 
 Livin' life to decor, spendin' nights at the fall 
 Season, no Venetians just drapes and rails 
 Vacations, no relations just relate the smells in hell 
 Fresh these breeze, West Indies 
 Amongst the baddest broads breathin', best believe 
 Bless the G's, the ones from the cloth within it 
 Taught through cimmick to con clones off and mimic 
 Thoughts extended, good livin', sleepin' women seekin' 
 Deeper enlightenment to keep from dimmin' 
 Skimmin' through life's chapters, life after I mastered 
 Seen a spark had the heart to grasp it 
 Ask it and receive, see you out and believes 
 'Cause please where I'm from I was told when I was young 
 Do it big at least once before it's all said and done 
 Work hard just to chill, want the house on the hill 
 Wanna spouse with the clout, move out when I feel 
 Do what I want, lay around in my trunks 
 Get a smooth good run 'fore it's all said and done 
 Work hard just to chill, want the house on the hill 
 Wanna spouse with the clout, move out when I feel 
 Do what I want, lay around in my trunks 
 Get a smooth good run 'fore it's all said and done
