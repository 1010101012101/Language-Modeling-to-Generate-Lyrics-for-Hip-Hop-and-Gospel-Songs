(Pete Rock) 
 Rock the house (rock the house) 
 East New York, east New York 
 East New York, east New York 
 East New York, east New York 
 My man AZ to the fullest 
 Verse 1: AZ 
 We was already loyal to people's minds and mulianis 
 Now we more fucked up with a mayor named Guliani 
 You can try to bomb me 
 Analyze but can't define me 
 My mind's divine heavily entwined with Gandhi's 
 Far from feeble, I leave your nostrils hard to breathe through 
 Cause my cerebral's are more of a higher plane 
 Than the Hebrews 
 My mic devotion brings out my deepest emotions 
 Overdosing wannabes posing 
 Sending them through convulsions 
 To hard to follow, you took a bite but couldn't swallow 
 Your mind's boggled 
 But I'm as deep as Donald Goines novels 
 My whole persona's kinda laid back like a recliner 
 And since my mama, I been fucking with marijuana 
 Wavy-haired, my skin got a money getting glare 
 Strictly menace wear, macking offa Guinness beer 
 So where it all begins is here 
 Destiny and me finally meet 
 So how can I be weak? 
 I'm rather unique 
 (Scratched in w/ Pete Rock ad-libs) 
 Why, why, why I'm rather unique 
 Why I'm rather unique --> Big Daddy Kane 
 Verse 2: AZ 
 My verbals rip shit 
 Brains give birth to thoughts in triplets 
 Fuck it I'm on some flip shit 
 Ready to let my clip spit, dramatical 
 Vocals release shells like automatics 
 Do music's magical causing any battle to be tragical 
 I got styles sick as hell, sicker than sickle cell anemia 
 Slaughter your circulatory like lukemia 
 Filled with larceny, who want parts of me? 
 I'm vicious, mad malicious 
 'Cause it's real on this road to riches 
 I got this mastered, other rappers'll craft it 
 Weak and wicked camoflauged as killers 
 How they speak and kick it 
 Peep this uniqueness 
 Nonbelievers I'm leaving speechless 
 Left to chokers and skunk smoke 
 Was coming through the speakers 
 Surgically nice with any verbal device 
 Trife, breathing life into mics 
 My insight's beyond the twilight 
 So die, fight, no surrender, no retreat 
 Techniques speak 
 I'm rather unique 
 Chorus [w/ ad-libs] 
 Verse 3: AZ 
 So it's gonna take more than your astrologist 
 To knowledge this 
 A physiologist couldn't even figure out the exoticness 
 Raps demolishing certified the way I style it 
 My wordplay blaze with the rays of ultraviolence 
 My culture's smiling, getting more in depth with each breath 
 My biography follows the footsteps of Malcolm X 
 Money and sex, Gore-Tex Donna Karan and Guess 
 Finesse, success through the life 
 Stress mics I blessed 
 Puffing trees to get me high as trapeze 
 Flipping Japanese at ease when I'm stacking G's 
 So let's discuss, plus degrees 
 How the rhyme forces the source for thoughts that's lost 
 So don't cross cause it'll cost 
 The ghetto savior, smooth, the real playa with flavor 
 Moves be major 
 With unexplainable behavior 
 The word's on the street so keep your ears to the concrete 
 (Why, why, why I'm rather unique) 
 Chorus [w/ ad-libs]
