Chorus: I wanna chill (Chill) on sugar hill (it's so lovely, so lovely) 
 AZ's for real (oh he's for real) he's for real (it's so lovely sippin on 
 Bubbly) 
 At times I wanna watch out the Mariot, zoning on owning co-ops, 
 Foreign drop top coups, and yachts guzzling straight shots a scotch, 
 Formulating up plots ta escape from Salems lock 'cause its scorching hot, 
 Making it hard trying ta figure who's out ta trap me, Pataki, got all 
 Kinds of undercovers coming at me, perhaps he, won't be happy, till they 
 Snatch me, and place me where half slacks be, sitting in Catsaki, but 
 Never me, see, my destiny ta be forever free, in ecstacy, on a hill 
 That awaits for me, so plus, just ta visualize is like a coke rush, 
 Vivid enough ta make living this a must, plus this is real 
 First line & (sugar hill baby, sugar hill baby) 
 Second line & (ayo son pull the shades down and lets count this money 
 Put the grants in the safe, 'cause we spending the jacksons, the 
 Washingtons go to wify, ya know how we do) 
 No more cutting grams, and wrapping grands up in rubberbands, I'm a 
 Recovered man, our plans ta discover other lands, suburban places got me 
 Seeking for oasis, cristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime 
 Faces, sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas, though this ain't 
 Promised, I'm as determined as them old timers, I wanna villa in a Costa 
 Rica, so I can smoke my reefer and enjoy how life supposed ta treat 
 Ya, laid in the shades of the everglades, finally forever paid, wearing 
 The finest fabrics tailors ever made, me and my team, carrabeans 
 Forseen, I guess being down for so long I'm all in store ta see my 
 Dreams 
 So until I see past the green pasture, me being supreme master, ain't 
 Much more life ta feind after, but another chapter, a new way of life to 
 Adap ta, 'cause these streets a gas ya, and have ya caught up in the rapture 
 De ja vouz, I could vision my killa crew, more hospitable, consciously 
 Aware plus political, 'cause though they claim that every man created equal 
 What's his native people, find it harder for nights to sleep through, 
 But once established we living lavish, like the house of versi, paris, 
 I gotta have it, it so plus, just ta visualize is like a coke rush, 
 Vivid enough, ta make living this a must, plu this is real 
 Ending: it's so crazy I'm down wit AZ, it's so lovely sippin on bubbly 
 It's so crazy jones and AZ, it's so lovely sippin on bubbly 
 I wanna chill on sugar hill baby 
 I wanna chill on sugar hill baby 
 I wanna chill, I wanna chill, I wanna chill on sugar hill baby 
 Sugar Hill
