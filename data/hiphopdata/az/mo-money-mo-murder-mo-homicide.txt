We bigger than the Jews... 
 Bigger than the Irish... 
 You can run the whole fuckin' country! 
 YOU could be the next John D. Rockefeller 
 "Nobody noticed us, nobody gave a shit... 
 But the bigger we get, 
 The more we're TAKING from other people.." 
 (Nas) 
 Yo, in a mahogany, black scenery 
 That was lightning and rain drops 
 I'm tied up in the basement cocaine spot like Bangkok 
 I'm blindfold, Vietnam type mind control this torture 
 His accent sounds like the rarest culture 
 Askin me, my atrophy stabbin me gradually 
 Says his attribute, was satanic, masonic, ironic 
 I felt reminded of my fast life ventures 
 And winters, blinded till the flashlight enters 
 (AZ) 
 Yo Dunm, before the sun set 
 Call connect get all the tech's 
 I'm vexed, this nigga soft as sex 
 Lost respect, let's off his neck 
 My calibre, got me thinkin' on a higher algebra 
 See me I'm just as foul as ya 
 But you ain't got no style in ya 
 I'm into bigger cheddar, G's and better, Armarett-ah's 
 Armani sweaters, plus these crabs could never dead us 
 Chorus: AZ (repeat 2X) 
 Mo money, mo murder, mo homicide 
 You catch that body nigga, better have that alibi 
 You never know it might just be yo' time you take yo' ride 
 To them pearly white gates, (now) watch that suicide 
 (AZ) 
 Now government official 
 Got you sippin Cristal in crystal 
 You fish you foul so you fell and took your fam witchu 
 I'm out to get you, guaranteed every shell'll hit you 
 Plus I'm on some shit too 
 Layin down whose-ever witchu 
 Mafioso, the New York City 90's era Sosa 
 AZ, you know my culture 
 Now my wolves is out to ghost ya 
 (Nas) 
 Scent of a rose on the graveyard for real now 
 The stakes is up a half a mil now 
 I tried to grab him with his shield down 
 Four walked in, they're crazy paid up 
 Sharp but straight up 
 Gators from Barbados, never seen nobody play those 
 Lay-Low's what they called him, his head baldin 
 Sippin cappucino, spilled on his silk suits, was scaldin 
 Laugh was vulgar, canvas paintings of the Isatollah 
 And on his arm he wore a priceless vulture 
 Tobacco pipe smoker, Escobar your life is over 
 Justify the righteous nova 
 Bullets flew out his right shoulder 
 Corpse leavin' a foul odor, The Firm Volume 1 adjourned 
 Bring it to a closure 
 (Nas) 
 So now you're rollin' wit us, 
 Like co-defendants, no phony business 
 So know the difference - from supreme solo 
 It's the styles ancient as Moses scriptures 
 It's Latin Kings, Black Kufis, and White Jesters 
 Amongst us 
 Crime invades the minds of youngsters 
 Where it's pitch black they can't see you 
 Godfather 3, fallin' for dead, in a cathedral 
 (AZ) 
 Now you're forced to listen 
 I got the mind of a grad from Princeton 
 Play your position, or soon you'll be lost and missin' 
 It's far from fiction 
 My presence is like that of a christian 
 With ammunition puttin' states under submission 
 Street addiction, got me tied in thorough with buroughs 
 Still in the ghetto, but in the cut where it's mellow 
 Incognito, on the lee-low, like Carlito 
 'Cause we know, niggaz don't really want us to see doe 
 You never know it might just be yo' time you take yo' ride 
 To them pearly white gates, watch that suicide 
 (Nas) 
 Homicide, mo homicide 
 Mo suicide, mo homicide... 
 {*Music fades*} 
 {*Untitled 1:18 length song starts*} 
 Born alone, die alone... {repeat 4X} 
 (AZ) 
 All alone in this wilderness 
 Who can figure life as ill as this? 
 My vision's blurred from guerilla's mist 
 Gun sprays, trey's left a portion of my crew in graves 
 Niggaz that would screw in ways unknown to these dudes today 
 Intelligence, kept us all away from state evidence 
 'Cause it's evident, this world is controlled on dead presidents 
 Never hesitant, I'm soulless, filled with coldness 
 Born to uphold this till I'm left dead from oldness 
 Born alone, die alone... {repeat 6X to fade}
