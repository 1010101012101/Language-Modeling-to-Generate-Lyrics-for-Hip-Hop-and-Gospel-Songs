 Yeah, back off vacation 
 Time to send y'all pros on a permanent vacation though 
 Check my track record, respect is my black Lexus 
 Expect me to act reckless, I'm rich and I'm ass naked 
 A mink with half leopard, my drinks and my glass separate 
 I roll and I'm half breathless, just stroll through my last message 
 Like... niggaz can't be serious 
 Never that leery shit, shit I'm mysterious 
 Move mystique on 'em, the doses increase on 'em 
 You ghost if you sleep on 'em 
 No joke when my peeps stormin 
 The cars they come in heavy 
 The God of the Serengeti 
 I charge with a large machete 
 And carve through ya starvin belly 
 Like... you shoulda known I was serious 
 Still the prettiest, point blank period 
 (Nas) 
 Feedin while alligators on swamps, got miles and acres 
 No comp, whether it's freestyle, or written down on papers 
 So far, I've been down from maybe, a decade, I'm still the raw-rest 
 Plus, suede, and ferragamo's, cause the made jury's on us 
 Garments fly apartments, they buggin say Nastradamus 
 Just wasn't one of my hardest, sold over a mil regardless 
 Chill with them hard looks, I spark clips 
 If you blood, or Muslim, 5 percent God, or crip 
 (AZ) 
 Yeah, ok 
 Guns in the glove compartment 
 I'm dapper but love the nonsense 
 The rappin' up of my conscience 
 I'm strapped when I come to conscious 
 Attack with a hundred monsters 
 They black and they runnin' bonkers 
 We back and we come to conquer 
 (Nas) 
 To master the fucking genre 
 Like, niggaz can't be serious 
 Still the grittiest, point blank period 
 Flow tight as a midget's closet 
 As tight as a prison block is 
 No sight of po-lice, when we riot 
 Fightin the system, fired 
 Be quiet, when I'm approaching 
 Get tired, jump out the roses 
 Sip Meyer's Rum out in open 
 I'm smokin' that hydro, choking 
 I'm scopin, my eyes are on you 
 Don't reach 'cause I tried to warn you 
 No street corner Nas won't come to 
 To bomb you, 4 5's will harm you 
 Eccentric, I'm live but calm too 
 Cordial, but crazy cautious 
 Roll through with some crazy gorgeous 
 Hoes, bodies like lady horses 
 Like, my whole stampede serious 
 Y'all niggaz is funny like Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" 
 Sped up or real slow, never neo-soul 
 Hip-Hop only rockin' with homey, we Co-D's 
 Nas not no Hives, or Coldplay 
 If there was an old days, we pioneered it 
 Anthony Cruz, Nasir Jones shit, very serious
