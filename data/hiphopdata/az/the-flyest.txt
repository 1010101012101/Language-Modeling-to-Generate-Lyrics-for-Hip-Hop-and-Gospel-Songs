 (Azv) 
 Listen, they wrote a book on your life 
 (Nas) 
 Right 
 (Azv) 
 You think anybody'll read it? 
 (Nas) 
 No fucking doubt 
 (Azv) 
 Let's make history homey 
 (Nas) 
 All right then 
 (Azv) 
 You know we brought the hoes clothes and money rolls to the table 
 (Nas) 
 No, fucking, doubt 
 (Azv) 
 It's time to manifest this 
 (Nas) 
 Shit we the flyest nigga 
 (Azv) 
 Bring it to a whole, y'know? 
 (Nas) 
 Gangsta nigga 
 Niggas better watch ya back, it's so cold 
 Pinky rings shining, so act like why'don't know 
 Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough 
 We the flyest gangsters 
 What you don't got is my natural glow 
 Counting out stacks and macking out hoes 
 Pushing big dicks and packing our chrome 
 We the flyiest gangsters 
 (Az) 
 Follow, I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo 
 Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow 
 Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy 
 The one the player haters hate dearly, but can't near me 
 Homicide can't scare me 
 I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga 
 The type that can build with ya 
 Verbalize bring life to a still picture, it's God-given 
 Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty 
 Truly my only duty is to dodge prison 
 Play wit me, I'm modest till them strays hit me 
 Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy 
 Dough forever, the live stay low forever 
 And fuck niggas, 'cause it's hard to keep them close together 
 One dependent, no wife, one co-defendant 
 No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance 
 (Nas) 
 I do what I can do when I can do it 
 Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feeling 
 Live how I live it's only 'cause I been through it 
 Learn to try it like to eat it and shit it's nothing to it 
 Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while driving outside 
 I'll never catch a vehicular homicide 
 My music is a description of my vibe of course 
 My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork 
 Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can 
 You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands 
 To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home 
 Once you let them in they staying, evil be gone, say it 
 I'm proud I'm ace but giving himself to the Lord 
 Wanted his Faith, think about Big anymore 
 Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changing 
 We ain't these little niggas no more, running dangerous 
 I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother 
 Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover 
 Be having they legs shaking, stab 'em, break 'em 
 I'm Hercules Hercules when having relations, the fliest 
 (Nas) 
 We put this on the, soul of our born 
 (Azv) 
 As we hold the Qu'ran 
 (Nas) 
 Kamikaze style 
 (Azv) 
 Older cats coachin us on 
 (Nas) 
 Yo it's kill or be killed 
 (Azv) 
 Understand, real'll be real 
 (Nas) 
 A forty-shot spectrum MAKE YOUR WHOLE EMBASSY KNEEL 
 (Azv) 
 Identity sealed, protected by 
 (Nas) 
 Our energy shield 
 (Azv) 
 And fuck a drop, cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed 
 (Nas) 
 Close the books 
 (Azv) 
 Was taught never expose a crook 
 (Nas) 
 Between the knight and the bishop 
 (Azv) 
 Want to knock ya rook, I'm a rare breed never had a fair to lead 
 (Nas) 
 I ain't light niggas recite 
 (Azv) 
 Too impaired to breathe 
 (Nas) 
 We both hard hit just like Camacho and Vargas, who's the target? 
 (Nas) 
 Now watch how we close the market, motherfuckers
