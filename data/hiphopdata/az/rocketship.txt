 Wherever, cause look, it really don't matter 
 Like yo girl cool, but look, mine badder 
 She count my doe, then we get blown 
 And blow it all like hammer

 Top down let the wind blow 
 Baby girl hands hangin' out my window (window) 
 Baby girl got sun glow 
 Might take a sip, but never touch indo (indo) 
 Do anything for me, she's all mine and that's how gonna be 
 Uh huh (uh huh) 
 Hell yeah (hell yeah) 
 Hey, I know that she love me 
 Love taps get rough like rugby (rugby) 
 Ain't afraid to get touchy 
 She kisses and she hugs me (hugs me) 
 Ain't never been messy 
 So fresh so clean just sexy

 Now things tend to slip my mind, but somethin' that will never 
 Is that your better, that and your clever 
 So it's a bonus your body happens to be sicker than ever 
 I'm lookin' at you while I'm sippin my beverage 
 Party like a rockstar till our heads feel severed 
 Whoa, swear I just lost my head 
 But if I do, would you love me then? 
 Excuse me you can I be your skin? 
 Whip you in shape, can I be your gym? hmm? 
 I just wanna be the driver in ya get away car when this movie ends, hell yeah!
