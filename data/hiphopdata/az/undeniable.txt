Rolling down the block pushing something you ain't never seen (yeah) 
 Shorty riding shotgun so incredible (so incredible) (gorgeous) 
 Lay back in the? down gangster lean (I stay chilling daddy, you dig, ha ha) 
 This feeling is undeniable 
 (Verse 1: AZ) 
 Drama seas, sands so white 
 Bahamas beach, your plans go right 
 Out of reach, rambo flights 
 In some two seater, sitting up like cleavage 
 Plane conceded, the prayer was a parapalegic 
 Save the chatter, my swagga's needed, believe it 
 Button ups, tailor custom cuts, 
 Trees on the feet, physique fucks him up 
 That's what's up 
 Straight from the gutter side 
 Keep clean on everything my mother dries 
 Still I love allah, sucker for southern fries 
 Facing affiliation, embracing my butterflies 
 I, (I) been down for a minute now 
 There's none flyer, all the live wires in the ground 
 A young messaih, admired by entire town 
 Sun-fire, stay higher than Miriah's sound 
 So you know I'm on some other shit 
 Sneak peak, low creep, deep cover shit 
 Rolling down the block pushing something you ain't never seen 
 Shorty riding shotgun so incredible 
 Lay back in the? down gangster lean 
 This feeling is undeniable 
 (Verse 2: AZ) 
 Local wars, coastal brawls, 
 If you ball at once, what's the most you saw? 
 If you fall, do you really got folks to call? 
 With that bell on hand, why they tell on fam? (sigh) 
 I feel his pain, how the unfortunate try to steal the fame 
 How it's more naucseousness than the killer in ray 
 Through so much anger, (clentching jaw) I know such danger 
 Thoro, I'm a decade in 
 From a borough way wicked than wes craven 
 Then again 
 Certain things I could never do 
 My whole life, get it right, get revenue 
 Get a wife, get a white BMW 
 2 doors style, take that roof off now 
 (Ha) that was dreams of a younger me 
 Now my hunger's humongous as a hummer 3 
 Ferarri drop, with that time in the summer T 
 Rolling down the block pushing something you ain't never seen (never seen) 
 Shorty riding shotgun so incredible (so incredible) (gorgeous) 
 Lay back in the? down gangster lean (gangster lean) 
 This feeling is undeniable (deniable) 
 (Verse 3: AZ) 
 I'm unsure, how I felt before 
 But for now all I ask, is Lord help us all 
 Help me stay focused, I'm self absorbed 
 And then sunny vibrations, real spot that's spacious 
 Few cases, Julio Englacias 
 Fl 
 Ow from the coop, I'm like Owens in the booth 
 Big boy, had his know from the roof 
 Way before rap, I can more than fall back 
 All that it's a beautiful zone 
 I stay mellow like musical tone, (musical tone) 
 Rolling down the block pushing something you ain't never seen. (never seen) 
 Shorty riding shotgun, so incredible. (incredible) (gorgeous) 
 Lay back in the? down gangster lean (gangster lean) 
 This feeling is undeniable 
 Is undeniable 
 Is undeniable 
 Is undeniable 
 This feeling is undeniable
