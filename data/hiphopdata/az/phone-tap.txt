[Nas] yo this esco, who this? 
 (Az) 
 What's the deally? 
 I just touched grounds down in philly 
 Brought a pound with me, feds floatin around silly 
 Tryin' to find lynn, bitch supposed to be in the benz 
 Parked in row ten, her and that slow hoe gwen 
 Should of known she was a bitch that we both could of boned 
 To post it alone, the ass had us both in the zone 
 But you know the rules, both been schooled by older dudes 
 I know the jewels 
 No time for them thoughts, too much to lose 
 Just tryin' to vibe until them hoes role with the ride 
 Where's your joy and pride? 
 You know little des got your eyes 
 (Nas) 
 In the cut, drop-z okay, the top's up 
 Left the mall bought little amal the toy truck 
 Your boy's what, three years old now, correct? 
 He and my daughter age neck and neck, they futures set 
 Trees got me wet, in the background's an old cassette 
 Fly stephanie mills shit 
 What's the deal with, all this shit I'm hearin up top 
 You got arrested, shot a fair one with a cop 
 That ain't ya stee', you usually low key with no t 
 I'm only goin' off of what some weak bitch told me 
 (Az) 
 That's some ill shit, hear that bitch go with her click 
 (Nas) 
 Yo dunn, 
 I'll hit you right back cause the static is thick 
 (Spanish speaker -> words unknown) 
 Chorus: dr. dre 
 We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do 
 Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew 
 All we need now is the right word or two 
 To make all it stick like glue, then you through 
 We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do 
 Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew 
 All we need now is the right word or two 
 To make all it stick like glue, we got you 
 (Az) 
 We just hit the cribbo, I'm curled up on this pillow 
 I'm still low, hold the ill news, these niggaz killed mo' 
 The shit touched me, tryin' to chill just lit a dutchie 
 From a while back - same foul cats who tried to bust me 
 Caught 'em sleeppin, in Spanish harlem with some puerto ricans 
 Up in washington heights right off the deacon 
 Feel awful speakin', for some reason, feel the phone's tapped 
 Alone with gats left with a vest to watch my own back 
 (Nas) 
 Keep your eyes open - stay wide, shit is mind blowin' 
 Look for any sign showin one-time is knowin' 
 About the dynasty, shit is not minor leauges no more 
 Cats bleed in this cold war 
 Son we took an oath, then this life took us both 
 We rich now, milk the whole cow, split the growth 
 Now I'm on the car doin', headlights on 
 Fluid in the windsheild wipes gone this light storm 
 That's formin in the sky, you comin' home tomorrow? 
 Will you drive or will you fly - hold up, my other side 
 (Nature) 
 Yo son some other cats tried to ruin our plans 
 Sendin two decoy bitches with pictures of you and your man 
 Askin your whereabouts - I gave 'em no leads 
 For all the nigga know them hoes fuck with police 
 (Nas) 
 No shit I'm clickin over, I'ma tell sos' quick 
 Son - them outta state bitches tryin' to get us both hit 
 That was nate, he hit me last night late while in my hoe's stomach 
 Said it's no hundred, we fbi's most wanted 
 So play the low, change your clothes, pack your bags 
 Watch what you say on this phone, get home fast 
 (Az) 
 Yo it's all good 
 I'ma hit you when I touch down tomorrow son, word 
 (Nas) 
 Stay on point - don't even use the phone 
 Just come to my crib yo, word up 
 (Az) 
 Out
