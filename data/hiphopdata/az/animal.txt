 I've been in this game for years, the name is The Animal 
 (Notorious B.I.G.:) 
 It's rules to this shit 
 (Intro: AZ) 
 Yeah, enough respect 
 The Bad Boy, Death Row, No Limit 
 Rap-a-lot, Roc-a-fella, Cash-Money, Ruff Ryders 
 So-So-Def, The Inc. 
 And all the incarcerated Scarfaces from ghetto to ghetto 
 Now introducin' to you a new Empire 
 Quiet Money Records and Hush Management 
 Formely presents - yours truly 
 (Verse 1: AZ) 
 I'm praised for wicked word-play 
 Emerge from my Earth days 
 Was boxed in the Bird Cage 
 Now flock wit the Mermaids 
 A shorty wop, till I copped then I turned age 
 Saw it unfold, certain laws are untold 
 Unsolved Mysteries, coffins is closed 
 A Carnivore trickery, cautions your road 
 Any slip-ups will be huntin' your shows 
 So neva get it twisted nigga, keep an Iron Biscuit witcha 
 Beast promoted, the street's is coded 
 For the Naked eye times is too deep to notice 
 Yeah I specialize in rhymes, but I peep the bogus 
 On every known level, I'ma stone cold Rebel 
 Clothes is crisp, I rolls Gold the Wrist 
 I was schooled how to tuck, hide and hold the fifth 
 How to crush, cut, divide and supply the sniff 
 So if the truth ain't need, then the truth can't be

 (Prodigy of Mobb Deep:) 
 I'm fallin' and I can't turn back 
 (Verse 2: AZ) 
 From base potter to that hard rock white 
 We all hustlers, live that hard knock life 
 Some get knocked, and their Hearts not right 
 Cuffed up in the air, met this charge that night 
 We all know that the Narc's ain't nice 
 But... that's the price when your bars ain't tight 
 The Beast within release within, you get caught-up lose trust 
 You don't speak to friends, you lose lust 
 Rarely fuck, you just seekin' Sin 
 You know ducks stay glizzly and love to get busy 
 The stakes is high, the bench is long 
 A few wakes niggaz cry, you live, you gon' 
 If you escape, rules apply, kids is born 
 And the game won't change, it's the same ol' game

 And I can't turn back 
 (Verse 3: AZ) 
 And my mind been back was since puffin' on the back-woods 
 Clutchin' on them clappers, and duckin' from them crackers 
 Neva been in Nappa, neva fuck wit no Rappers 
 I'm so gon' wit it, but I'm so long winded 
 Seen the worst, when I seen my first 
 Body get caught, I was prolly this short 
 The victim right beside me, stressed on the sidewalk 
 But you neva seen a man cry, till you seen a man die 
 The killer shots, the realer the co-op 
 If you could realer, then it's similar plots 
 Then if not, you won't familiar, you a squilar 
 You no dilla you hot, fuck around get the whole block locked 
 But neva me, I've been Boss playin', cookin' up saut√©in' 
 Till I saw another dough, I had to force a nigga weighin' 
 Now in all Black wit the Gloves and Hat 
 I'm so deep in it, that I can't turn back
