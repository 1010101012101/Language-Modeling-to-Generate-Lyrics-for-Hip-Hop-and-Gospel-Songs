I'm ready 
 You know the chronicles the shit that if momma knew 
 The stress, the drama dude, the tech's phenomenal 
 Rapid fire, pecs through the adominal 
 You bastard liars, it's me who's the honorable 
 Bathed and clothed up, shaved and close-cut 
 Restraint from temptation was drained from both nuts 
 Heh! Now in the physical form verbalized through the scriptures; I was Biblically born 
 It's I, a Jeremiah, conceived through the blunt fire 
 On Kawasakis, could wheelie up on one tire 
 Well respected, gel connected, got the method for the woody females perfected 
 For sure, very few flaws, heavy Chevy two doors 
 Candy-painted to give a nigga the blue balls 
 'Course, this the life I chose 
 The bid, the 360, the cipher's closed, c'mon 
 The format is real sickening, contagious 
 Here I come, AZ 
 Still, I don't have to run no games--I've done those thangs 
 Young and gifted, my tongue's prolific 
 In the beach bungalow is how I brought in Christmas 
 From the streets, I'ma flow from the hungriest districts 
 Switch kicks, crisp when I come to them picnics 
 Play it slow, paper chase, stack, and lay low 
 Range Rove, tinted all black, the same old 
 Psychic mind, writes his rhymes 
 Still turn the new leaf on my life of crime 
 No concerns with new beef who's as nice as I am 
 It's confirmed from feet--I'm still a sniper blind 
 Built my fame, spilled my pain 
 Politicking daily--still tryn to milk the game 
 Its obvious that I'm real, rap skills remain 
 I took some change and I'm still the same 
 The format is real sickening, contagious 
 Here I come, AZ 
 Still, I don't have to run no games--I've done those thangs 
 Learned the system, burned some izm 
 Jotted my jewels down like journalism 
 How I maneuve', now it emerged through wisdom 
 A pilgrim prophesied, puttin' words to rhythm 
 Relatin', an Adam Clayton in manifestation 
 Patient, meditatin' with them animals waitin' 
 Pacin', like an M-8 that sealed its fate 
 Let some years escape, but I'm still in shape--I'm Chillin' 
 Deeply rooted, a beast with music 
 From Bed Stuy to the East, I'm too at peace to lose it 
 But love it, I still does it 
 Breathin off a Trump budget 
 Fresh outa Bloomie's with the Louis luggage 
 The format is real sickening, contagious 
 Here I come, AZ 
 Still, I don't have to run no games I've done those thangs
