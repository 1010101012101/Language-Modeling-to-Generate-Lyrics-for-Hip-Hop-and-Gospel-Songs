(Feat. Cormega, Foxy Brown, Jungle, Nas) 
 (Foxy Brown) 
 Protect this nigga for the necklace 
 I though of the death wish 
 The pretty slim sex shit the rep this 
 Remember Fox said this 
 We on some neck shit, we blessed this 
 The scars on our back, we met this 
 The live form, the 25 sentence to keep my eyes on 'em 
 I'm straight, knowing Allah shine on 'em 
 Shitty drugs and drama I present 3 pretty thugs in the dime mama 
 Feelin' the rest, its illa chest when booked through the kiss of death 
 It was over and we laid out 
 Chill I was hoping of the way he ate out 
 It was real, for real I was fuckin' with Mills and he was fragile 
 We wildin, the brown stallion, stay stallon 
 On the low foulin the whole Firm wildin 
 You lucked it, I know the trick bitch he fucked wit 
 On some duck shit, heard through the grave that she sucked it 
 Firm: Sos and Esco, mad loco, Fox and Mega for whatever 
 And through this cheddar, we going to stay family until we fry though 
 The fam will never split even if one of us die though 
 Along with our get-go, we gonna blaze bricko 
 Peeped the nana, sweet taboo the firm tattoo on the dada 
 Now tell me what crew hold it down like we do dada 
 (AZ) 
 Till the death of us murders moves pursue efflux 
 Ice necklace high price dress executives 
 Peep the grammar, slim built strong stamina 
 44 nickel plate long with the silencer 
 Play for keeps in the shut eyes, you stay sleep 
 Shit remain deep cause shells thrown at range jeep 
 Giuliani suite got all the kings going at creek 
 Devil light beers, now who left controllin the streets? 
 No intelligent, strictly slow niggaz mind we negligence 
 It's evident, past vest up, bring your residence 
 We often livin' heavy weight firm division 
 Mind, I check mine, eating swine cause my religion 
 You know the steeze, take game cock and squeeze 
 It's the prophecy, not the philosophy Socrates 
 Next up... 
 (Cormega:) {Yo I believe that's me} 
 Aiiyo Mega represent for the family 
 (Cormega) 
 Aiyo, the feds got me in the top 10 
 'Cause when my crew I got knocked in 
 My 4-4 main cocked in 
 My sinister mind shines like dillenger 
 Mega exhausted baby face crime emperor 
 Yo, life is based on poachers and grease 
 And peep the way drugs feed thug nigga sees 
 I seen niggaz light up, hand cuffed and tied up 
 Coke price rise when drugs supply dry up 
 The millennium drives up 
 Rims semi blind your eyes temporarily 
 Mind Mega be heavily arm for felonies 
 Shine you could never see, the next fat cat out NYC 
 It Was Written like, ghetto life hieroglyphics, livin' 
 Since my real niggaz bailed me out of prison 
 I'm not schemed cause the narcotics team in Queens 
 Have more dollars than the knowledge of fiends 
 My dreams is the legacy of Montana treasury 
 Fake thugs could even take slugs or bury me 
 (Nas) 
 To all thorough breads taking corners y'all need to join us 
 Firm most powerful nation of rap performers 
 High class, generals, confident paying loyals 
 Sweef as Oscar Delahoya green baret warriors 
 Face I peep like 'em like the J. Kennedy tape 
 In a new with dudes bustin' all in the face 
 Another word you see threw 
 My men build Sugar Hill from a sweet tooth 
 We all eat, 'cause I speak the truth and educated 
 Black youth's street diploma, teach Greeks and Romans 
 But the legacy was stolen, it's a Firm thing genuinely gleam 
 I wrote theme on how to sell millions 
 While y'all crabs mad at your promotion team 
 I roll with nicest, fox, the black ices, push your Benz without license 
 Gear, tight as bike clips, Nas got 19 wifees 
 7 shiesties, non of them pizies, 3 white meat under tight jeans 
 Wildin, big links is heavy like wink that you shoot on your pitbull neck 
 While feeding him raw steak, its court take, more cake 
 I take the crown of the so called king of the town and lock it down 
 (Outro: Jungle) 
 Yeah dunn, that shit dunn, y'all niggaz ripped that shit yo 
 Word is born, that's that real shit, for all y'all fake 
 Motherfuckers out there yo 
 That's how we do it from Queensbridge nigga, The Firm 
 What 
 This is Jungle, yo big Jungle boy what? 
 Y'all niggaz don't want it 
 Yo Stoute, if these niggaz don't know right now, yo 
 Fuck all them niggaz then
