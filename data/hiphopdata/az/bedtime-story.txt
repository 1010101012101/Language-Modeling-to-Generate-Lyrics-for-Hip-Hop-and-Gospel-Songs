 Amar, Amar, c'mon. 
 Yeah Dad, what? 
 Hope you did your homework already. 
 I did that already, c'mon Dad. 
 Nah, it's time to go to... 
 C'mon listen... 
 What happened? 
 I went to school today I said AZ's my daddy, they said, "Jay-Z? Nas?" 
 What, what? 
 Tell me the story again? 
 Ok, ok. 
 Aight, this is how it went down... 
 We talkin' a few years before you even appeared 
 I was into my little gear, yeah 
 Weed and my beer 
 Hustlin out of fear, fear of bein' a square 
 Like them cowards with no gear 
 They just breathin' the air, son 
 Clear, but didn't realize life ain't fair 
 With one drive-by, it could end your life right there 
 Though I'm a fly guy from ???? 
 My knife's like chyeah 
 Fuck the world we can fight right 
 I don't scare 
 From beer 
 No more nightmares here 
 Not a tear 
 I was strighter than the white man's hair 
 Met Nasir, had that hype that jeer 
 Like a kite, threw me a mic 
 I took flight right there 
 That ain't lies I was nice I swear 
 Went fool with the jewels, even iced my ears 
 New school, I was cool, wanted righteous wears 
 But from the door they didn't like that there, I ain't care 
 As long as I left the china white right there 
 And understood that you could change a life through prayer 
 It's all good 
 Police even politely stared 
 Was unreal, but still now it feels slightly weird 
 I was spared 
 Gave love, taught my peers 
 Though it was buff, never gave up, fought my fears 
 Now it's like "what?" 
 I'm G'ed up, awesome blair 
 Entertainer from the streets with a sportsman's flair 
 Yeah, that's good enough for you? 
 Dad, Dad, what's "G'ed up?" 
 Listen man, don't worry about that now, just go to sleep 
 Ok, ok. 
 I'll tell you that later on. But you know what? 
 What, what what? 
 I got one more quick story to tell you. 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. 
 Maybe you could take this story, and tell your friends at school this one: 
 Heeeeere we go! 
 Out the gate, he who hate himself ain't straight 
 He a snake, he the type who send himself upstate 
 Catch a case for a plate 
 He ainn't have to take, he coulda 
 Played it safe, said his grace and ate 
 But it's fate 
 (Fades...)
