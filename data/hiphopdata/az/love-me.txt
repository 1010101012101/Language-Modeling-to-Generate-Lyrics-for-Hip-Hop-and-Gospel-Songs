Uh huh 
 Word Up... 
 Drop the beat right here 
 Yeah 
 (Chorus - repeat 2X) 
 Loooove me in a special way what more can I say 
 Love me now love love me now 
 Since Illmatic this shit started that never departed 
 I flossed retarded for them lost in the projects 
 I taught them logic gaining courses in college 
 Chased dollars but to me what's most important is knowledge 
 Know the ledge for y'all niggas that so on the edge 
 It ain't nothin' for an infrared to go in your head 
 Life in the streets schooled me well movin light on my feet 
 So deep had me jumpin' up at night in my sleep 
 Hold ya heat if you that nigga that's influencing beef 
 I'm trying to eat don't have me put two in ya feet 
 99 ways I made out to never fade out never get played out 
 Got guns blast ya way out 
 Saw the worst when I was growing 
 Unknowing my quest until I had reality thrown at my chest 
 Why would it stress it seem a nigga zone at his best 
 Is it a test at times I feel my soul is possesed 
 Flavors of Guess throw key at major connects 
 Crazy respect goin' through it made me a vet 
 Gettin' down on grounds forbidden 
 Made bails from ?????? to the cells in Clinton listen 
 We could war till we no more either or 
 Or just ball till we all score it's on y'all 
 Did this one for the streets watchin 
 And the D's in the streets let them keep clockin 
 We clean got love for the whole game 
 To go change fake I.D.'s and the code names but no lames 
 3 op's and there's more to come we all as one 
 Recognize I been this raw since young 
 Was I sent for the sinners that never repent 
 Or just another thug bent trying to pay for his rent 
 Days in contempt I see how y'all amazed in suspense 
 Ways spent catch me at the major events 
 So blow a herb on ya corner curb my word 
 Doe or Die I was born a swerve bet that 
 From 40 bottles to the champagne twist a pop 
 White Lables to the brand names kids on top 
 And let's toast for the lost souls 
 And pray enough to hope and meet 'em at the crossroads reunite 
 Hope I live to see 88 with crazy cake 
 In a baby shaped burgandy Bentley with Haiti plates
