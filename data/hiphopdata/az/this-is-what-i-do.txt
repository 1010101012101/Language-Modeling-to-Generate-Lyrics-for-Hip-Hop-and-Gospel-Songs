(Intro: AZ) 
 Yes, yes, ladies and gentlemen 
 I'll like to thank you for your support, love 
 Not only to me, but to the whole hip-hop industry itself 
 We as a whole, we've been weathering in the Storm 
 From the start, 30-plus years ago to now 
 But uh, like all weapons of hate, we perceiver 
 So allow me to speak not only for me 
 But on behalf of the hip-hop coalition 
 Every hood, every ghetto across the United States of America 
 (Verse 1: AZ) 
 Yea, as a youngin' I was sittin'- spittin' sponge-in' 
 Just learnin' the life, and Christ second comin' 
 Well mannered and nice, got advice from women 
 But when the money get tight, the stomach start grumblin' 
 It was some of then, wasn't all Hammers then 
 Went in the Benz, it was kingpin and bubblin' 
 We started huddlin', puttin' in, and jugglin' 
 A shear later we straight, no more strugglin' 
 But that was only the start 
 The love between homey started fallin' apart 
 I guess anything's addictive when it's callin' your heart 
 Death and incarceration had us all in the dark 
 We was done, some'll say "we had a beautiful run" 
 And the beauty is skin deep was beneath the slums 
 I was numb, that was like speakin' in tongues 
 So relax, I adapt within a week I was sprung 
 Spoke facts on the track, it's like squeezin' a gun 
 No more crack, all the boys on my back hearin' "RUN" 
 Yea, I changed & came, all them years, on the stairs G Rap & Kane 
 I felt pain, them beamers still lurkin' my brain 
 But the ways is the most high is to preserve to explain 
 It was the fame, that focused me, perfected my game 
 And like that, there's so many others that this rap will remain 
 And in exchange, we give fans the force of the reign 
 To feed, nurture, and breed, and be the voice of the slain 
 It's a shame, but that real shit come wit the life 
 And in order to obtain you gotta sacrifice 
 It's like cuttin' your bitch shorter, don't pass on fights 
 I'ma tourer, so you know all my facts is right 
 Plus my Aurora is like used spoilers on the porch at night 
 So be polite, just go for them critics that write 
 This is Rap, we from the hood, just tryin' to get a slice 
 Some'll bite, but the most just coast wit ice 
 And rock a little chain, get a little brain 
 (Immediately changes to AZ talking) 
 Ha ha-ha ha, yea, hey, it is what it is 
 You know Rap has no rules 
 See my enlightener he-he once told me once said 
 "If there is no devilish-men, then there won't be Godliness" 
 "One can't exist without the other" 
 Knaw'mean?, it's like a Doctor is only needed to heal 
 And he caters to the sick, so the sick must exist, ya heard? 
 A Minister - he only gives sermon to - uh you know - 
 Those seeking for forgiveness - so them sinners must exist 
 You know? it's simple simplistic, ha ha-ha ha 
 It's AZ the GOD - Constantine - Quiet Money for life 
 This is What I Do, I'm here
