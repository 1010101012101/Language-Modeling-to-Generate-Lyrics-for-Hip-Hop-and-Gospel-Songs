(Intro: AZ) 
 Yes sir! Another year, ha, ha, ha! 
 Toast ya glass please, this is champagne 
 You know what it is... 
 I love when the music sound so vibrant 
 So refreshin', all right let's get down to business 
 (Verse 1: AZ) 
 It's a - thin line between love and hate 
 And due time, a stable mind separates what's fake 
 It's Two kind of paper takers, make no mistake 
 You got those that touch a little 
 Then there's those that rape 
 I've been embraced, got a face that the game can't shake 
 I'm known well like a Coke scale, my name hold weight 
 Impeccable taste, medallions in symmetrical shape 
 Since '88 been wildin' wit a Electrical tape 
 Was a Ape to that street rap presented itself 
 Who could beat that, so like Lennox I surrendered my belts 
 I was felt wit five funnies, my cars was dealt 
 Wit my money and subconscious, I was God himself 
 The weed helped, but overall I was so Hip-Hop 
 Certified as a cool guy to be so hott! 
 Verbalized like 2Pac, wit a East-Coast bop 
 Then the shit just changed, had to switch up lanes 
 Past predicted the future, though the present exist 
 Poetic wise I'm Kama Sutra, it's a heavenly bliss 
 Schooled as a little dude, only dealt as diss 
 But you know 'em people is sick and they medicine mix 
 So 50 it's only a run, enjoy this here 
 Matter of fact you ain't done, enjoy this year 
 And uh it's only fair I make this clear 
 You could neva fuck wit me, so don't neva fuck wit me 
 If money makes the man then on Iraq land 
 Saddam statue will still stand on top of the sand 
 You a fan so overall respect my hand 
 'Cause I can see what's goin' on, I respect your scam 
 And we can toast to the life that showed us both 
 That trials and tribulation only bring forth growth 
 And when we bhost, you could bet who be felt the most 
 So live your life till the reaper approach...
