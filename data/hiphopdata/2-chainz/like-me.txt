Girl, I'm just another bird 
 Don't make me make you fall in love 
 Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me, like me 
 I swear I'm just a bird 
 Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me, like me 
 They ain't never seen a nigga like me uh 
 She ain't never seen a nigga like me uh 
 Chance of that is unlikely 
 2 Chainz in my white tee 
 I wipe her down and I pipe her down 
 I give my girl money to go out of town 
 You give your girl money to go to Niketown 
 And I one-night her, you must like her 
 Kill niggas with one-liners, all I need is one lighter 
 Counting so much money, I got arthritis 
 So cold I frostbite 'em, no Pig Latin but I hog-tied 'em 
 If she gets this business then I (make her fall in love) 
 With a nigga like me I'm killing this beat 
 Skeet skeet skeet skeet, skeet on my sheets 
 On top, from the back, I thundercat like (HOE!) 
 My girl got a big purse with a purse in it 
 And her pussy so clean I can go to church in it! 
 Oh Lord, O-M-G, I am the O-N-E 
 How ya like me now, it's cool but she want more D 
 Moet by the fireplace, this is how desire taste 
 And I'm 'bout to buy a case (leggo) 
 Girl, I'm just another bird 
 Don't make me make you fall in love 
 Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me, like me 
 I swear I'm just a bird 
 Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me, like me 
 Tell 'em... yeah 
 Album coming this summer 
 Def Jam... TRUUUU!
