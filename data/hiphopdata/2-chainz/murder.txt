(2 chainz - hook:) 
 Murder, murder, this right here that murder 
 Pulled the car out the garage, they screaming bloody murder 
 Murder, murder chalk line around your daughter 
 3 Cell phones and I still don't ever call her 
 (2 chainz - verse 1:) 
 Murder, murder, smoking on that murder 
 If a girl out with me, just know she murder 
 Murder, murder, take her ass like burglar 
 Then I put her on the loud and feed her turkey burgers 
 Murder, murder, this is bloody murder 
 All this ice all over me, I should wear a thermos 
 Murder, murder, hit you with the burner 
 Hit you with the burner, hit you with the burner 
 (2 chainz - verse 2:) 
 Murder, murder, yea I'm killing niggas beats 
 When I'm out of town and on the stage it's rest in peace 
 Murder, murder somebody call my lawyer 
 They said I was killing tennessee when I was down in florida 
 Murder, murder, my shoes none than a quarter 
 Rapping with the murder team nobody wanna record us 
 Murder, murder listen to the chorus 
 Niggas wanna know how I get it when I get 
 Don't worry, just know it's murder 
 (Kreayshawn - verse 3) 
 This right here is murderous 
 I'm mama kreay the gangsterous 
 From the east to the west it gets dangerous 
 When you get that dough on display and shit 
 Bitches will be hating this 
 But my mind still climbs for greater-ness 
 That money that I'm playing with 
 Put a whole in your head with no blame for it 
 Saying it 
 I'm kaying 
 Come back to the block and I'm spraying it 
 Delaying, I'm stopping it 
 Put a end to your life, I'm blocking it 
 Your career bitch, you was never on 
 I heard 2 chainz blocked you off his phone 
 Bitch don't call him if you ain't 'bout to ho 
 Bitch don't call him if you ain't 'bout the doe
