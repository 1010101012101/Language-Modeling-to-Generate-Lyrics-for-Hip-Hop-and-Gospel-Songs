 With my back against the wall ain't no pressure 
 When the defense really on, ain't no test 
 Pull up real slow in a taxi 
 Gunshots turn 'em into athletes 
 I was hungry for a mil I gotta have it 
 Drove a couple couple cars up the mansion (Nah foreal at one time) 
 Smoked a whole seven sitting in the traffic 
 And niggas couldn't beat me if they practiced 
 Used to use my safe for a mattress 
 Used to use my mattress for a safe 
 See I could count a hundred thousand backwards (99, 98, 97.) 
 And I'm just tryna get it every day 
 They feigning for the trappers and the rappers 
 They feigning for the trappers and the rappers 
 They feigning for the trappers and the rappers 
 And now your mall on that, shawty what's happenin'

 Used to hustle at the store 
 Used to get it with my bros 
 Used to bet on tenfold 
 Now I'm all around the coast 
 I be all up on the pole 
 I be smokin' on that gas 
 It might make them bitches choke 
 Old school with the rallies 
 Used to meet them up at rallies 
 So it's fuck your P 
 The streets have taught me how to get it (get it)
