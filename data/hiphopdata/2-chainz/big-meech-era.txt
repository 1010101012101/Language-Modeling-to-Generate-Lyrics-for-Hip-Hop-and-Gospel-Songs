I think I may have to take it back to like to 10 years ago, you know 
 BIG MEECH ERA (you feel me?) 
 Real Real Motivation for a street nigga *2 
 Pull up in all color Ferraris 
 Bitches in Tiaras 
 If you in here while I'm still here 
 Everybody else starving 
 Everybody else starring 
 Shawty got the Mclarian and I had the 7 
 Pulled up at the Compound, clothes smelling like gun powder 
 Salute to the real niggas and real bitches who got they own bottles 
 I was snapping before fabo my raps come wit aHalo 
 Went out with Jeezy we spent pesos like J-bo 
 Took E's to the 20 grand he got a pistol on him and 20 grand 
 A couple things I ain't glorifying is the kids dying and the mommas dying (Scarface) 
 Everybody need to calm down stand right by your homie side 
 Gunshots in this motherfucker turn this bitch into a homie-side (yeah) 
 Over a million sold they say I'm crossing over. 
 Oh yeah the club packed, I should've brought a rubber 
 My whole body inked, my family hardly know me 
 You know I put that work in just to get a Rollie (I did) 
 Big meech era 
 Japanese Dinner 
 Trap in these denim (damn) 
 Ain't stuntin these women (naaa) 
 Wood Grain steering wheel I just might catch a splinter. 
 If this a flexing contest I think we found a winner 
 I think we found a winner 
 Pull up in some shorts middle of December 
 Put this shit down, that shit, I can smell that moon rock 
 I got to tell you how that shit started 
 Trapping off the court on the back porch (I DID) 
 Had that pack ordered. We was back door. (We was nigga!) 
 That's that good shit that's that hood shit (WE HOOD) 
 You a cute bitch and your crew thick (I LIED) 
 Got a chopper on me the size of pool stick (this long) 
 With a blu davenchy, dog food bricks (Heroin) 
 Snowman on repeat, Rest In Peace Nando 
 I see Jigg in here I see Quazy too 
 When brawl witchu we send them bottles through we send the marters through 
 I'm on the Carter 2 
 Like Tyrese was on the Marta too 
 They start calling too 
 They starting falling through 
 Got them chickens boy like a barb b q (tell em) 
 Talk to lame niggas something we hardly do 
 I sip the PJ bottle I rock the AP on them. (okay) 
 I think my rollie harder this an AG PARTY 
 Over a million sold they say I'm crossing over. 
 Oh yeah the club packed, I should've brought a rubber
