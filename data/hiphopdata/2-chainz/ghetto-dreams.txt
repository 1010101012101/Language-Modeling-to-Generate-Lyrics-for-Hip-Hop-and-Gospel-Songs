My ghetto dreams always turn to ghetto nightmares 
 At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn 
 Candlesticks in the dark 
 I was whippin' it hard 
 I was gettin' the broads that like "Who the hell is that?" 
 I was dealing sap 
 You looking at a nigga that drove to hell and back 
 Charismatic I was raised by an addict with money in the attic 
 Got goons while you at it at this Present time I'm out of my mind and that's a habit 
 Still got them waiting in line they gotta have 
 Last night was the first night I got sleep 
 Tossing and turning for two or three weeks 
 My nightmares are triggered by bad memories 
 Lord, send me an angel right now while I'm having ghetto dreams 
 Cold sweats listenin' to the old sweat 
 One, two that's a hoe check 
 Now for real, nigga this a whole check 
 Just bossin' around, polo sweats 
 Used to dream about a bigger couch 
 Woke up in a bigger house, c'mon 
 Commas in my bank account 
 So much money I had to let the banker count 
 Last night was the first night I got sleep 
 Tossing and turning for two or three weeks 
 My nightmares are triggered by bad memories 
 Lord, send me an angel right now while I'm having ghetto dreams 
 It's like the world stand still 
 Yesterday your little man got killed 
 And all he ever wanted was a bank roll 
 But he died too young kuz the game cold 
 Most niggas ain't know or they just think slow 
 Once you get in you gotta leave but you can't though 
 Does freedom make a motherfucker evil 
 To the point down your ass when he see you 
 Let's take that needle, fill it with poison 
 Inject the ghetto with the drug, paranoia 
 Got you lookin' at your homeboy sideways 
 Ain't no honor among thieves? 
 They tell me crime pays, but I don't think so 
 Because every criminal I know is in the clink, yo 
 A nigga in the game right now 
 Must be working for them people cause that shit played out 
 I lay awake in my four corner room with the candles
