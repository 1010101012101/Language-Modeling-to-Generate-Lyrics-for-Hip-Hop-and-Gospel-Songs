It's at least 100 degrees, sweating like a fool 
 Aiight, ay, ay, ay, ay 
 Young Juice, ay, ay, okay, okay 
 By any means I gotta get it 
 You can sleep when you die, point blank, period 
 No excuse for this, you only get one life 
 You only get once chance 
 You can get more wives 
 You can get more ice, you can get more cars 
 Nigga listen to what I'm saying, I'm a real superstar, woo 
 Look in my eyes, look in my eyes 
 You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die 
 Look in my eyes, look in my eyes 
 You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah I got too many watches on my arm 
 I got too much shit goin' on 
 I got your favorite stripper on my phone 
 I got a bank account, got another bank account 
 Got another bank account, to be continued 
 Hibachi my menu, my bracelet on igloo 
 Every song is a single, you hear how the money talk 
 I may be bilingual, I pour out a liter, I light up the reefer 
 I'm back to charging niggas 100 a feature, yeah 
 Look in my eyes, look in my eyes 
 You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die 
 Look in my eyes, look in my eyes 
 You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah 
 Hard work beats talent 
 Dope boy meets talent 
 Don P and eat salad 
 Walking around, my feet Bally 
 Sisquo and St. Ives 
 Six guns, eight knives 
 Potato on the barrel of it 
 Make you niggas hate fries 
 Been poppin' wheelies since 14 
 Sleeping with them, in them since 14 
 Ready to take one for the team 
 Ain't no discount, if ain't the one, we got a miscount 
 I am the truth, lil' nigga, shooting bullets from the booth, lil' nigga 
 BOOM 
 Look in my eyes, look in my eyes 
 You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die 
 Look in my eyes, look in my eyes 
 You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah 
 You too concerned with others 
 This for the single mothers 
 Might have a millionaire 
 Moving through Riverdale 
 Jacket on Rick Flair 
 Watch on Rick Flair 
 James Brown with the slick hair 
 Watch how she dance on it, dance on the work 
 If the pussy squirt, put her name in a verse 
 I am so high, I'm scared to jump 
 Keep the gas on me, I'm prepared to pump, all right 
 Look in my eyes, look in my eyes 
 You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die 
 Look in my eyes, look in my eyes 
 You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah
