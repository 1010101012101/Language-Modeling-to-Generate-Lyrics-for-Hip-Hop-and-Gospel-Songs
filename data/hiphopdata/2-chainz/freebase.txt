What is it? 
 Freebase 
 What's free about it? 
 I thought about it, I said, listen 
 Should I talk about freebase and what if, or somethin' 
 People say well no, everybody goes and then people will start goin'... 
 No. Let me... I gotta talk about what happened to me 
 See where we're from, it's all or nothing 
 But we take penitentiary chances like it's nothing 
 We came from nothing, Freebase from top of the oven 
 Get money my type of discussion 
 Yaw can do this shit for free a nigga like me gone be hustlin' 
 Freebase, freebase, freebase, freebase 
 Freebase, freebase, freebase, freebase 
 I came from nothing, me and my niggas we came from nothing 
 Sold that 'caine like it's nothing, told you from the introduction 
 I came from the pain and suffering 
 Two pit bulls and a TEC-9 
 TEC-9 use to Jam up on me all the time 
 Swear to God if you come up in my momma yard 
 I'm a shoot that mutherfucker till it get tired 
 Big dually truck got six tires, big ties wanna rhyme mixtapes 
 And I keep shitting on the competition, I'm a bout to put up me out a shit tape 
 Just went playin' by no rules; every night I freestyle on Pro Tools 
 Tell Flex come to the A we'll carjack him by one of them raggedy ass old school 
 I don't respect my elders, these right here Maison Margiela 
 I cannot get no earrings, it'll make my Rolex jealous 
 I been a fellon since 15, my expedition had a big screen 
 Half you niggas was constipated, half you niggas was Shit deep 
 Zone one all the way to zone 6, fuck y'all I'll buy own shit 
 Fuck y'all I'll buy my own whip, fuck y'all I'll buy my own brick 
 Tell them pussy niggas ain't pay shit, better be ready to let the gat loose 
 I've done a song by everybody from Jermaine Dupri down to Papoose 
 I came from nothing (Skrr, skrr) 
 I came from nothing (Skrr, skrr, skrr) 
 I came from nothing, I came from nothing (Skrr, skrr) 
 I came from nothing, I came from nothing 
 Work hard play hard work hard again 
 My bankroll had twins can you comprehend 
 Seafood lover I don't eat pork 
 Used to hit them J's like a 3-point 
 My partner mascot is a pitchfork 
 And you already know what this for, me too 
 Rent due, doggin' these hoes like a Shih Tzu 
 So cold I record it in a igloo 
 Nigga ask me why I don't drink 
 Man let me tell you what the wine do 
 My partner came in said that my girl 
 I had to tell that motherfucker mine too 
 Court dates in the summertime 
 Might pull up in a vert 
 No matter what the charges is 
 I'm a pull up with a smirk 
 This right here for Old Nt 
 This right here for Godby Rd 
 This right here for Riverdale 
 Trappin' at the Stop-N-Go 
 Trappin' at the Texaco 
 It was Amaco before it was BP 
 My plug from Mexico he fell out when he see me on TV 
 Sold drugs to my love ones and it's hard for me to admit it 
 The first time I've seen a crack pipe was in my parents kitchen 
 I came from nothing (Skrr, skrr) 
 I came from nothing (Skrr, skrr, skrr) 
 I came from nothing, I came from nothing (Skrr, skrr) 
 I came from nothing, I came from nothing
