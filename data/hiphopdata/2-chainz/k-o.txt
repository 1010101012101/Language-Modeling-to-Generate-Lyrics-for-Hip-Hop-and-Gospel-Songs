When I woke up this morning 
 All I could think about was you 
 'Cause when I went to sleep last night 
 All I could think about was you 
 Adam and eve don't eat that fruit 
 'Best believe I'm a eat that boo 
 'Cause I'm the nigga that told them niggas 
 That told them niggas, 'bout you 
 Chuck the duce, while I'm ridin' through 
 Tityboi I might sign a boob 
 Your nigga hatin', tell your nigga that's hatin' 
 That if he gettin' some paper I might sign him too 
 'Best believe I'm just slidin' through 
 Put your panties to the side let me slide through 
 I can see you niggas from a side view 
 I'm in and out the pussy, drive through 
 White coupe, with the white rims 
 I like to crack the top and let the light in 
 You know she dark skin her friend light skin 
 Put us together, and it's ice cream 
 Sandwiches she can't manage it 
 I know her man is sick, she can't handle it 
 She need some time alone I told her call my phone 
 And when she call my phone I did answer it 
 K.o 
 I'm gonna smoke till you niggas can't smoke no more 
 Roll till your bitches can't roll no more 
 K.o 
 I'm gonna pour it till you niggas can't pour no more 
 Blow till your bitches can't blow no more 
 K.o 
 B-i-g 
 Okay I'm in motion I'm rollin' and smoking 
 And smoking and rollin' like I'm locomotion 
 I'm walking outside and I'm causing commotion 
 Got perp and champagne that's a real nigga potion 
 I'm burnin' bread toastin' and joking 
 'Cause I went from veiws 
 Of my moms house to views of the ocean 
 Niggas talk shit, but that's free promotion 
 I'm living my life like the end is approaching 
 Man fuck these niggas with a passion 
 I'm gettin' paid from the cradle to the casket 
 My grandma said boy you need to read a bible chapter 
 Till I bought her ass a house 
 Bigger than the pastor's, hallelujah 
 Your now fucking with a bad bitch connoisseur 
 My ex-girl said man the fame caught up to ya 
 Baby you don't still think about me, wet dream about me 
 I swear you use to couldn't wait to k.o 
 K.o 
 I'm gonna smoke till you niggas can't smoke no more 
 Roll till your bitches can't roll no more 
 K.o 
 I'm gonna pour it till you niggas can't pour no more 
 Blow till your bitches can't blow no more 
 K.o
