If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged 
 If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged 
 My future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 I don't see you broads, I don't, I don't see you broads 
 I don't see you broads, I don't, I don't see you broads 
 Future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 I'm criminal minded, winter coat climate 
 Cold, fucking up your sinus 
 Bitches might choke, I'm giving them the hymn lick 
 I'm a pimp In my own fucking rhyme, and you my side bitch 
 Ugh, 2 Chainz two pinky rings 
 I like to play with Lucille's, B.B. King 
 You don't fuck with us, we don't really fuck with y'all 
 Stunna bought some yachts, we in the ocean playing bumper cars 
 Pocket full of money bitch, and my crew eating 
 Got a nigga shining like a brand new nickel 
 Plated pistol, this my last shot, just left the dealership and I cashed out 
 If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged 
 If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged 
 My future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 I don't see you broads, I don't, I don't see you broads 
 I don't see you broads, I don't, I don't see you broads 
 Future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 Black shades, gold chain, and a Versace scarf 
 Swear you haters couldn't see me if I glowed in the dark 
 What it be like nigga? What it look like ho? 
 Still shine on a nigga, ten chains look like it's lightning doe 
 No love for you bustas, consistently stuntin' 
 Mo' bottles of Rose, yeah you know who run it 
 Thousand dollar shades on, all gold frames 
 Mister Fuck-your-bitch-and-leave-her, that's my code name 
 I'm blowing money in this bitch, I think I'm Birdman 
 Trapping ain't dead, getting money like the bird man 
 Bad bitches, whole lotta ass 
 Make you famous in this bitch soon as the camera flash 
 If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged 
 If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged 
 My future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 I don't see you broads, I don't, I don't see you broads 
 I don't see you broads, I don't, I don't see you broads 
 Future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 In the kitchen and we cooking up that raw hard 
 Driveway shining, I'm a movie star 
 Open up the bank bitch, bring 'em large 
 Flip 'em and we bust 'em, then we ship 'em off 
 Perpetrating'll get your head bust 
 A hundred million,'ll get you dope flush 
 A new Bentley, you get a ho rush 
 Big money shit, we popping 'cause we came up 
 Hella choppers, on them new thangs 
 Big yachts, brand new wings 
 Them hoes flopping, 'cause they know the frame 
 Cartier, ten carats on my pinky ring 
 If I stand next to ice, then I'm camouflaged 
 If I stand next to lights, then I'm camouflaged 
 My future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 I don't see you broads, I don't, I don't see you broads 
 I don't see you broads, I don't, I don't see you broads 
 Future's so bright, that all I see is stars 
 My shades on in the club, I don't see you broads 
 Yeah, just like that my nigger 
 Dark room, tinted shades on 
 The GT poppin' 
 In the club gettin' mines homie 
 Back room, VIP people 
 YMCMB flashing lifestyle, what up Detail? 
 Yeah, I rock to this one my nigga, let's get it
