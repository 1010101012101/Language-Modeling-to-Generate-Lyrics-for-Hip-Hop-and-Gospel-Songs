You did it for the broads, I did it for the paper 
 Got a hundred styles, got a hundred acres 
 Fuck the police (fuck 'em), hundred middle fingers (fuck 'em) 
 And you a square nigga (fuck 'em), you a chess table (fuck 'em) 
 You be savin' hoes (fuck 'em), you be rest haven (fuck 'em) 
 Got a lotta rides (count 'em), like a bus station (pull up) 
 See my phone ringin' (hello), see my diamonds danglin' (bling) 
 See the bitches blinkin', blue C-notes 
 All of 'em singin', blue C-notes 
 All of 'em Franklins, blue C-notes 
 Spend without thinkin', a tool without safety 
 I have ya broads taken, I have they heart achin' 
 Push start crankin' (skrrt), new grill face it (get 'em) 
 New mill taste it (mmm), straight without a chaser (waste it) 
 Draws come from Macy's, broads is confirmation 
 Same in different places, I run all the bases 
 You did it for the broads, I did it for the paper 
 I got a hundred styles, got a hundred flavors 
 Fuck the police, hundred middle fingers 
 And you a square nigga, blue C-notes 
 All of 'em singin', blue C-notes 
 All of 'em Franklins, blue C-notes 
 Spend without thinkin', ice on both pinkies 
 Mobile phone ringin', blue C-notes 
 I did it for my dogs, I did it for the skaters 
 I did it for the paper, my niggas still on papers 
 I got a hundred tats, I got a hundred million 
 I keep on switchin' wifeys, you gotta Uncle Phil me 
 Dreadlock Rasta, hair like pasta 
 I don't see what's your problem, I need an eye doctor 
 Flying to them dollars, ducking fly swatters 
 Shoot 'em in the head, leave his mind boggled 
 Comin' down the boulevard I'm on your avenue 
 A half a mill on my grill, you niggas snaggle tooth yeah 
 Told some dead presidents I'm finna bury you 
 When it come to presidents I like 'em black and blue 
 You did it for the broads, I did it for the paper 
 I got a hundred styles, got a hundred flavors 
 Fuck the police, hundred middle fingers 
 And you a square nigga, blue C-notes 
 All of 'em singin', blue C-notes 
 All of 'em Franklins, blue C-notes 
 Spend without thinkin', ice on both pinkies 
 Mobile phone ringin', blue C-notes 
 Got a hundred styles, got a hundred acres 
 Got a hundred tats, got a hundred skaters 
 Did it for the broads, I did it for the paper 
 I'm 'bout to buy a hog, I'm bringing home the bacon
