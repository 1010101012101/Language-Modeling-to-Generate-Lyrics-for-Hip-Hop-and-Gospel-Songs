This my letter to the rap game 
 Hip hop, I'm a product of the trap mane 
 Crack came, I didn't know how to act mane 
 I did what I had to do when the pack came

 Wu-Tang Clan, they ain't nothin' to fuck, wait 
 2 Chainz ain't nothing to fuck with 
 Need search warrants cause these niggaz is suspects 
 All I talk is money so Chainz is the subject

 Came in this motherfucker hundred grand strong 
 To be exact, grinding the kush pact 
 Ride with the roof back, live with a suit act 
 Killing em, so I am dying my suit black 
 Dear rap game, you are ill homie 
 Havin' me thinking we were gon' make some real money 
 Came from the streets, I'm a beast, capiche? 
 Lock my dick in the mail by the bills held 
 And hey rap game, the real comin' 
 The way I'm murking these niggaz hope your will comin' 
 And when you're numb, it's kind of hard to feel somethin' 
 I'm the type to get rich and still hustle, yeah 
 And before I leave let me say this, play this 
 Have my niggaz dead or in jail like Asic 
 Face it, back to the basics 
 2 Chainz on them bitches, looking like Vegas, the greatest

 My worlds coming to an end, speaking philosophical 
 Six's on the coupe, when they said it was impossible 
 Got the type of guns to make the city feel uncomfortable 
 And we breaking bricks down, till the last molecule 
 Cherish the horizon, sun blessed party, hey 
 Thinking 'bout this business, and it's time that I gave away 
 Trying to make a plan today, niggaz on there way 
 Locked in confinement, gotta learn to levitate 
 And on the inside, my instinct, I survive 
 All I got left is pride, touchdown, I'mma ride 
 I was raised as a boss 
 Damn, I let a nigga take me off 
 And let him tell Josh that his pops was soft 
 Mothafucker

 Crack came, I didn't know how to act mane 
 I did what I had to do when the pack came 
 Rocking blood diamonds, cooling in the hood with the goons 
 Came on this, Cam is trying to buy us some Guccis 
 It's a movie made, regardless, my crooks is the hardest 
 Buying crazy pots and pans, stay in apartments 
 Bank roll was all we ever needed 
 While niggaz was weeded, playing space, and pumping crack in the ceiling 
 Just fly young with heart, I sift in the park 
 Made sales, blazed a few shells, yeah who cares who you are 
 I'm honest, I make you cry like onions 
 Stay in your lane, beat the name and we done 
 I was legend yet, now my papar stretching, yeah, that's it 
 Go ask the Rocky Glass, "I class act?" 
 Villas, moving-making guerrillas, the willas 
 The guest-star gun fights, squeeze on the squealers 
 Don't come near me, nigga 
 If you don't got no money, fear me 
 Matter fact, move it, ya hear me?
