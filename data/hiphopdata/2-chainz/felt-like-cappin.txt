Felt like cappin' 
 I felt like cappin' 
 I felt like cappin' 
 I felt like cappin' 
 In heaven, it (?) 
 Presidential Rolex, I declare 
 I don't care what they doing over there 
 Rubber dreads and a ponytail 
 I thumb through the cash right in front of folks 
 AK on the yacht, that's my banana boat 
 South Florida for the winter, I got sunburn 
 Half you niggas was some suckers in the lunchroom 
 I don't care about the tats on your face 
 Them bitches cost 15 dollars 
 I don't care about the pills that you take 
 Them bitches cost 15 dollars 
 I'm a rich nigga, I take rich drugs 
 Smoking gas and drinking lean in the strip club 
 Got too many kids to play with you niggas 
 I'm lost for words, nothing to say to you niggas 
 I got a Maybach, a Chev (?) pedal, Wraith, an Audi Infinity 
 Got a tour bus that's long as a fucking centipede 
 Got a Panamera, (?) and a sling 
 Cappin', I'm cappin', I'm cappin', I'm cappin' 
 I put it in your face like a motherfucking napkin 
 Got me a Sprinter just to play the fucking game in 
 At night time I turn that bitch to the fucking Days Inn 
 (?) Cross the zone and they looking like "ay man" 
 They looking at me like I'm paid man 
 It's nothing much that I can say man 
 'Cause my actions speak louder than my fragrance 
 Felt like cappin' 
 I felt like cappin' 
 I felt like cappin' 
 I felt like cappin' 
 I felt like cappin' 
 I felt like cappin' 
 I felt like cappin' 
 Felt like cappin'
