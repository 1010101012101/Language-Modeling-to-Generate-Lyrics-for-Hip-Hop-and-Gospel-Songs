Beautiful... Pain 
 Niggas studying shawty know what a hundred do 
 Actually the nigga backing me is right in front of you 
 Raising a daughter sometimes depending what her father do 
 Niggas stunt on you, front on you 
 Niggas can't even ball but bunt on you, them niggas lame 
 I hope you get testicular cancer in the brain, dickhead 
 By the time you get there 
 I be somewhere with a six pack and a six pack 
 Her lips and her hips thick 
 My boxers are covered in her lipstick 
 Her pussy fat but ain't good, so that's a misprint 
 I'm a misfit, I did it and beyond 
 Shiny watch look like the old Diddy on my arm 
 Highly flammable, barely keep getting in Canada 
 Run this rap shit, I got stamina 
 You an amateur, I aim at 'cha, I bang at 'cha, hope a plane hit 'cha 
 Fuck you and whoever came witcha 
 Trying to express the beautiful pain witcha 
 Like a tattoo of a framed picture 
 Of a dead homie, maybe a family member 
 I got some gambling scriputres like um 
 Scared money don't make no money 
 Bet now motherfucker gonna take them from me 
 Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking 
 I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking nigga 
 Oh I feel so fly 
 Came so far, but I still wanna fly 
 So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane 
 See what this beautiful pain, provide 
 Baby look into my eyes 
 Shamon... hm-mmm 
 You talk about hurting try washing clothes with no detergent 
 Daddy deserted so he now serves sandwich serving 
 Dreaming we had a furnace so cold sleeping on the curtains 
 What can I say it got me highly motivated, mama two job working 
 But now the companies emerging 
 Need a two week notice before they say don't need your service 
 I'm to young to have burdens, but still feel I should be further 
 But who I'm I kidding I had bridges but I just burned them 
 My mama need earnings, ain't had no time I had learning 
 Call me a hypocrite, backslider, you name it I done heard it 
 The way they speak of me you think I'm already murdered 
 It's hard to be laid back, my haters so assertive, but 
 I gave my life up, I gave my rights up 
 I gave my dice up and I gave my dykes up 
 I gave my vice up and every club that lights up 
 And this is were the intern with no perm lights up 
 You don't see my pain 
 I guess it's beautiful pain 
 It gotta be beautiful pain 
 Sometime you don't gotta say much 
 Oh I feel so fly 
 Came so far, but I still wanna fly 
 So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane 
 See what this beautiful pain, provide 
 Baby look into my eyes 
 Life is a game of inches 
 Every move leads to something better 
 There's no time to pay the bitches 
 Gotta get in the game and live forever, and ever 
 I'll be the man or I rather die 
 I'll be the man or I rather die 
 I'll be the man or I rather die 
 I'll be the man or I rather die 
 I'll be the man or I rather die 
 Scared money don't make no money 
 Bet now motherfucker gonna take them from me 
 Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking 
 I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking nigga 
 Oh I feel so fly 
 Came so far, but I still wanna fly 
 So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane 
 See what this beautiful pain, provide 
 Baby look into my eyes
