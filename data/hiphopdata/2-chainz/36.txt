 Whip that shit, whip my wrist 
 I might whip your bitch if she ain't with that shit 
 Young whippersnapper, I might eat that snapper 
 Got a yellow bitch, gotta whip them at ya 
 All I know is soda bakin' 
 All them other niggas fakin' 
 Watch them niggas fall to pieces 
 All them other niggas flaky 
 Did it for my city sellin' crack out my building 
 Now I ride around with a crack in the ceiling 
 Exhale, Ziplock, flip-flop with them burglar doors 
 Yeah, I got that hard work 
 Nigga, you are unemployed 
 Residue all on the floor 
 Just made a mil so you know that's what I'm hungry for 
 Get it how you live
