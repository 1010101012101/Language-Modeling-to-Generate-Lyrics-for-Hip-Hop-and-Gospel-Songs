And when you spiral through the atmosphere 
 All they see is motion 
 They never see the tears, they never feel the pain 
 They always think it's nothing but it's something, such a shame 
 So caught up in the fantasy, humanity has made a love story out of tragedy 
 But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge 
 And there's no one to talk you down and tuck you in the bed 
 Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny 
 Of something for the books or the bars 
 To bob your head and nod 
 I recall, so many never ever thought you'd make it 
 So sad they were mistaken, the joy they tried to take it 
 Mama said that "The best thing you can do and be is you 
 This world ain't got but one, so give credit where it is due" 
 Ain't that the truth 
 And here you are, a black unicorn 
 Mythical, mystical, since the day that you were born 
 Mastered all the madness, let the magic have his way 
 Let the power paint the day, let the god have his say 
 Cause there's a place that you can go, no one else is allowed 
 Sitting up on your cloud, so high when you look down 
 Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found 
 Then know that you can stop your search, cause love is all around 
 Yeah 
 Free at last, free at last 
 That's what I said when I got out my last deal 
 Some people can't relate, sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit 
 And when it's cold outside, so your pipes won't bust, turn on your faucets 
 Drip, fuck the water bill, we stay in apartments 
 And everything is a obstacle 
 When they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital 
 Now they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere 
 I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years 
 Yeah, and that's my car talking 
 Old school running with the dogs barking 
 Parked out that bitch like I'm sellin' coffins 
 Weed so strong I be seldom coughin 
 And I'm covered in Balmain 
 Instagram pics of my lobster omelette 
 Sellin' that parcake, life ain't no arcade 
 Now I got more knives than the 4th grade 
 It's all I really want 
 It's all I really want to be 
 It's all I really need 
 I want, I want to believe 
 Thought you had the best of me 
 Now I'm what you need, you need 
 Hear ye, hear ye 
 You can't come near me 
 Competition must fear me 
 Lyrically, I could be Talib Kweli 
 But with gold teeth it'd be hard for some to believe 
 I leave them pussys stinkin like Summer's eve 
 I practicin' repitition now I need a hundred G's 
 A hundred M's, hug and squeeze 
 Dad kept us in the Dungarees, rather rap but I love the cheese 
 I change hoes like I change gears 
 And my yard so big I got pet deers 
 And my homies try to act like ain't real 
 I put my apron on and taught myself how to make meals 
 You need a focus group, my group focus 
 Hit the loker jokers with the hocus pocus 
 I'm the dopest you can quote this under scope 
 Its just me and GOAT, 
 Dirty ass niggas will sell your ass a key of soap 
 I'da seen 'em rich, I'da seen 'em broke 
 I'da seen it all watch the pregnant lady smoke 
 When the baby come out it gon' be geeked 
 You never know he might come out to be me 
 It's all I really want 
 It's all I really want to be 
 It's all I really need 
 I want, I want to believe 
 Thought you had the best of me 
 Now I'm what you need, you need
