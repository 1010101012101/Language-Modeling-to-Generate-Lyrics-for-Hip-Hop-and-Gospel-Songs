"Good God Almighty, like back in the old days 
 You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play 
 How to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock 
 But um, we just went in the studio and we did it 
 We had champagne in the studio, of course, you know 
 Compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it 
 So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much 
 As we enjoyed playing it for you, because we had a ball 
 Only real music is gonna last 
 All the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow" 
 Cash rules everything around me 
 C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all 
 After hours of Il Mulino 
 Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' about women and vino 
 The contract like '91 Dan Marino 
 I swear this got Michael Rapino boostin' my ego 
 Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now 
 Debates growing 'bout who they think is the best now 
 Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now 
 I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now 
 I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it 
 Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it 
 I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks 
 No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all 
 My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants 
 Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me 
 My high school reunion might be worth an appearance 
 Make everybody have to go through security clearance 
 Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn 
 With the ink, I could murder word to my nigga Irv 
 Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog 
 You know it's real when you are who you think you are 
 Cash rules everything around me 
 C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all 
 Cash rules everything around me 
 C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all 
 Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces 
 The all black Maybach but I'm not a racist 
 Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is 
 Yellow diamonds in my Jesús 
 I just might learn to speak Mandarin 
 Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin' 
 International Hov, that's my handle 
 My saint's Sean Don, light a candle 
 El Gran Santo on the mantle 
 'Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too 
 Shoutout to Worldwide Wes 
 Everywhere we go we leave a worldwide mess 
 Yes, still Roc La Familia 
 Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us 
 The homie said "Hov, there ain't many of us" 
 I told him less is more, nigga it's plenty of us 
 Cash rules everything around me 
 C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all 
 Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake 
 500 million, I got a pound cake 
 Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake 
 Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes 
 They shoulda never let you 'round cake 
 Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake 
 Now here's the icing on the cake 
 Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake 
 Uh I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah we got it bitch 
 I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did 
 Dame made millions, Bigg made millions 
 Ye made millions, Just made millions 
 Lyor made millions, Cam made millions 
 Beans tell you if he wasn't in his feelings 
 I'm back in my bag 
 My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag 
 A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash 
 Gucci air bag just in case we crash 
 Uh, last night was mad trill 
 I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel
