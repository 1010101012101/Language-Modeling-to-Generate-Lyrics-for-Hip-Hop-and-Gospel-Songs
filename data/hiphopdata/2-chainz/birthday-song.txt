Yeah, birthday, it's your birthday 
 If I die, bury me inside that Louis store 
 They ask me what I do and who I do it for 
 And how I come up with this shit up in the studio 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe 
 When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store 
 When I die, bury me inside the Louis store 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe 
 She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty 
 Scrr scrr, wrists moving, cooking, getting to it 
 I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere 
 Just made a jug, I got bands everywhere 
 You the realest nigga breathin' if I hold my breath 
 Referee, with the whistle, hold his tech 
 Extendo clip, extendo roll 
 When your girl leave me she need a hair salon 
 Hair weave killer, goin' on a trapathon 
 See I done have more bombs than Pakistan 
 Bomb, bomb, and a bomb 
 She, I'm ballin' you in will call 
 When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store 
 When I die, bury me inside the Truey store 
 True to my religion, true everything I'm too different 
 So when I die, bury me next to two bitches 
 They ask me what I do and who I do it for 
 And how I come up with this shit up in the studio 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe 
 When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store 
 When I die, bury me inside the Louis store 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe 
 Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you doing huh? 
 It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh? 
 She holding out, she ain't givin' to the needy huh? 
 You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on 
 Y'all been together ten years, you deserve a Minaj 
 'Specially if you put that BMW in the garage 
 'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her mamma crib 
 Weren't you at niece's graduation? Man, I hate those kids 
 Last birthday, she got you a new sweater 
 Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her, "Do better." 
 She said, "How 'bout I get you jewelry from the Weston?" 
 How 'bout she hit the west end and get her best friend? 
 I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her 
 Don't be actin' like no actress, if we preachin' then we practice 
 Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit 
 We in Kanye West's Benz, 'cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian 
 They ask me what I do and who I do it for 
 And how I come up with this shit up in the studio 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe 
 When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store

 I show up with a check to your workplace 
 (Then hand the valet the keys to the Mercy) 
 Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on 
 (What I'm seein' from the back I can't front on) 
 They ask me what I do and who I do it for 
 When I die, bury me inside the booty club 
 Get it good, get it good, get it get it good 
 I might switch it up and get you good 
 They ask me what I do and who I do it for 
 And how I come up with this shit up in the studio 
 All I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe
