Listen to fuck niggas 
 Let em' know I'm still up in here been poppin' 
 Do so many shows in arenas 
 My nigga I need me a locker 
 Look at my car, how did they get on them sixes 
 This flow come from Drizzy, he got it from Migos 
 They got it from Three 6 
 Look at my bitches, look at my wrists 
 Realest nigga in the game 
 My nigga ain't no counterfeited 
 Bitches is thick and delicious, doing they dishes 
 100 million on my wishlist 
 Taking penitentiary chances 
 Just to drink lean in them benzes 
 2 Chainz! 
 I want my trapback, I said that I want my trapback 
 I'm from the apartments, used to walk around with work in my backpack 
 G's all up in that shit 
 G's all up in that bitch 
 Drunk calling me by my government 
 Running shit, gunning shit, shopping in London and loving it 
 Excerpt from Stepbrothers: 
 Okay first of all, I needed someone- shut your mouth 
 I'm sorry what did you just say? 
 I think we've had enough here, shut your mouth 
 Shut your mouth, will you shut your mouth? 
 You're just coming off as stupid 
 I'm coming off as stupid? 
 You're wearing tuxedos to a job that requires you to clean bathrooms 
 Please leave this office, we're done with this interview 
 Do we get any sort of souvenir? 
 Get out of my office! 
 I want my trap back, I said I want my trap back 
 They sayin' that money talk 
 Nigga so you already know that I want my cash back 
 You niggas ain't talking about shit, Harley Levin 
 You would've thought that there was some kilos on my bus 
 But they didn't find a thing 
 Hair looking like Brillo, my flow Armadillo 
 Catch me first class on Delta with Versace all in my pillow 
 I bet I seen a kilo, the dope my hero 
 Remember I had that Box Chevy I set that bitch on some P zeros 
 You know that I'm rocking Buscemi, and I'm as raw as sashimi 
 Her head is so cold my nigga I think that she gon' need a beanie 
 Rolling and smoking zucchini, dropping the top on the whips 
 Making them look like bikinis 
 I am now balling so hard 
 I should be on my own box of Wheaties
