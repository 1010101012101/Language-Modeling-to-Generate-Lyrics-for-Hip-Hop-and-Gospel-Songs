 She said "oh, you got that comeback", she said my dick is a necessity 
 Drop my drawers, and pull out my longevity 
 She just hop on it, and then she forget everything 
 Oh she so open, who's obsessed with me, when she leave me, she come back like she ain't never leave 
 She talk bad about my new bitch, 'cause we got chemistry 
 She said "it ain't jealousy", allegedly

 She said "yeah, right, nigga, what I look like?"

 So she said "oh, you make me sick 
 I love you, I hate you, I'm leaving, I'm lying 
 'Cause none of them niggas, can never be you, they can never be you, though I don't know why" 
 If she's over me, I look up to the sky, I see her falling for me like a bomb 
 She said "I know you'll miss me when I'm gone"
