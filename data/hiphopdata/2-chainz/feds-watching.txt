Tomorrow, tomorrow 
 Tomorrow, tomorrow 
 Ain't no such thing as tomorrow 
 The way we living today 
 Dreads hang on the side 
 Now everything Mr. Comme des Garçons, Mr. Alexander Wang 
 Mr. Chain, pinky ring, flow insane, ho insane 
 Man, these shoes I got on these are hardest I've done seen 
 It look clean where you pour I remix it make it dirty 
 If she got good head and text me I text back and tell her "hurry" 
 It's that category 5 when I walk up in the strip club 
 Throw it high, make you and George Washington head butt 
 OG's never fed us, now young niggas fed up 
 Ballin' so hard I deserve a and one 
 Baking Soda marketing, I'm getting it ain't I? Obviously. 
 You a bitch, you a ho, that's just my philosophy 
 And I'm known to kick it like the captain of a soccer team 
 Billie Jean red leather same color red lobster 
 And she brain wash ya 
 I be fresh as hell if the Feds watching 
 I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching 
 I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching 
 I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching 
 Drop top, head bobbing 
 I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching 
 I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching 
 I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching 
 Drop top, head bobbing 
 Grams to Grammy's, two guns Yosemite 
 Niggas put their Glock on your ass, fuck that Heather B 
 Pumping that amphetamine, all this D I'm peddling 
 I be somewhere settling, somewhere that you have never been 
 To the top you never been, you might need a respirator 
 Money on the rise like I'm counting on a elevator 
 You gon' need a detonator swimming with them barracudas 
 Put the rocket on that ma'fucka prosecutor 
 This Armani, this Givenchy, I parachute you 
 I'm so fly I jumped out the Air Wang Gucci (Tell 'em!) 
 I'm raw, talking California Rolls 
 Smoking California weed with California hoes (Truu!) 
 Sending flicks to my partners in the state pen 
 I just got some pants made out off snake skin 
 See them shades you got on call Ray-Bans 
 And the shade I got on cost eight bands 
 I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching 
 I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching 
 I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching 
 Drop top, head bobbing
