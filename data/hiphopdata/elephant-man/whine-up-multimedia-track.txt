It's summertime 
 Ladies looking hot 
 Shaking up what they've got 
 Elephant Man and Kat, c'mon 
 Kat 
 Sense is telling me you're looking 
 I can feel it on my skin (Whoa) 
 Boy I wonder what would happen 
 If I trip and let you in 
 Don't get shook by my aggression 
 I just might be the one 
 Let's skip this conversation 
 Just whine your body up 
 (Ha ha ha) 
 Don't wanna wait no more 
 (Ha ha ha) 
 You got what I'm searching for 
 I'm feeling your vibing 
 I'm riding high its exotic 
 And I want you, I want you here 
 Pull me closer and closer 
 And hold me tight to your body 
 I wanna feel you, I wanna feel you near (whoo) 
 Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea! 
 Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea! 
 Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea! 
 Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea! 
 A ese nene lo tengo trikiao 
 Cuando lo bailo lo bailo de lao (oye) 
 Y lo empujo lo tengo tumbao 
 Con mis caderas lo tengo amansao wind! 
 Boy keep doing what you're doing, get me hot 
 Winding up your body you don't have to stop 
 My temperature is rising, want you more than before 
 It's an animal attraction, whine your body up 
 (Ha ha ha) 
 It's the magic on the floor 
 (Ha ha ha) 
 I don't wanna wait no more 
 'Cause I'm feeling your vibing 
 I'm riding high its exotic 
 And I want you (and I want you too) 
 I want you (and I want you too) here 
 Pull me closer and closer (closer and closer) 
 And hold me tight to your body 
 I wanna feel you (I wanna feel you too), I wanna feel you near (whoo) 
 Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea! 
 Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea! 
 Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea! 
 Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea! 
 My Dear, whine up your body bring it to me right here 
 She got the finest body I swear 
 Shake off your booty, shift it in high gear 
 She says ele run your fingers through my hair 
 All the blind man could see quite clear 
 The way she whines it gives me nightmares 
 Find har G-spot and touch har right there 
 Wah pop off di clothes she a wear 
 (Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa) 
 It's risin'
