Out of dreams 
 Into my life 
 Sweetest thing 
 Beneath blue skies 
 As we dance across the 
 Borderline 
 Every breath, touch, a 
 Thousand smiles 
 Here in this life we ar etwo hearts 'n' fire 
 Ligt of my life (is what you are) 
 We are two hearts on fire 
 Right here tonight 
 We are two hearts on fire 
 A breath of life (is what you are) 
 We are two hearts on fire 
 Touch of hands 
 Two worlds collide 
 Time stood still 
 For you and I 
 Borderline 
 Every breath, touch, a 
 Thousand smiles 
 Here in this life 
 We are two hearts on fire 
 Light of my life (is what you are) 
 We are two hearts on fire 
 Right here tonight 
 We are two hearts on fire 
 A breath of life (is what you are) 
 We are two hearts on fire
