 All yuh do play cool and don't act a fool mek sure yuh brain intact 
 Turn to yuh girl, inna di passenger seat, give har yuh strap fi lock 
 Tek mi outta di car, tell mi nuh move and have dem gun pon cock 
 Wonda if it's a racial ting like Rodney King because I'm black 
 Search di car, only ting dem find is just my CD stash 
 We good to go, like a don, and go hear some album tracks 
 Search search search but they can't find nothin (Nothin)

 Well mi seh born as a juggler hustler but believe mi 
 Snitches a sell mi out like they wanna see mi 
 On COPS, America's Most Wanted or Court TV 
 Feds dem a hunt fah mi wid info from dem source 
 But everytime dem reach we disappear just like a ghost 
 It's not like mi a brag or mi a boast 
 But mi have my own a source, see di report, dem always keep mi posted 
 I see the, five O watchin (Watchin) They got they eyes on me (Eyes On Me) 
 They wanna set me up, land a couple pies on me (Pies On Me) 
 I'm streetwise I don't ride with them pies on me 
 The feds takin pictures and they tellin lies on me 
 Oh see I'm way too clever (Clever) They'll never jam Joc 
 You with all of them snitchesm get you and your fam shot 
 I keep my eyes on my rear view, gotta get a clear view 
 Watch what you do when the five O near you 
 Once you hear that WOO! WOO! WOO! (Come on!) put the stash away! 
 When you hear that WOO! WOO! WOO! (Weh yuh seh!) A.K. away (A lie!) 
 Yo! You got your thing on ya? (I got my ting on mi) 
 You got your thing on ya? (Of course mi have mi ting) 
 Once you hear that WOO! WOO! WOO! (Weh yuh seh!) put the stash away!

 Tell D.A. seh fi bun appeal, eh?

 Then they find somethin a fi fry mi 
 Search search search but they can't find nothin (Nothin) 
 Look look look but they can't find nothin 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Five O! 
 Wyclef they wanna frame frame frame say they lookin for somethin 
 My lawyer got me off now I'm sittin in somethin 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Five O!
