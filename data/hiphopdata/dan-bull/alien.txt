In space, nobody can hear you scream 
 In space, nobody can hear you scream 
 In space, nobody can hear you scream 
 In space, nobody can hear you scream 
 This is a transmission from Amanda Ripley McLaren 
 I'm stranded in a ship that is barren but it is apparent 
 That there's a visitor with the viciousest plan 
 And I'm a fish in a barrel, this isn't a Christmas Carol 
 But if you could tell me, just what the dickens was happening 
 And what this is that I'm tackling, I'd be pretty thankful 
 Lights flickering, life trickling through the cracks in the corridor floors 
 Is quite sickening, no time for dithering, babbling, impotent panicking 
 The impetus will drag us kicking and scrabbling into the blackness 
 I need my wits about me, this bleeding bitch has found me 
 Come to think of it, I really shouldn't spit so loudly, whoops 
 This is survival of the fittest 
 Survival of the vicious 
 Survival of the wickedest and sickest 
 This is survival of the fittest 
 Survival of the vicious 
 Survival of the wickedest and sickest 
 This is survival of the fittest 
 Survival of the vicious 
 Survival of the wickedest and sickest 
 This is survival of the fittest 
 Survival of the vicious 
 Survival of the wickedest 
 Continued transmission from Amanda Ripley Mclaren 
 The more I witness the madness the more that it is apparent 
 What evil hazardous demon hell is this? 
 Is it a lucid dream of a weak, cadaverous human being with sleep paralysis? 
 I'm none too keen to feed the ravenous beastly savages with creepy phalluses 
 Creeping round the ship till my radar's beeping vanishes 
 Nothing seems as loud as my breathing pattern is 
 The teeniest sound could be the catalyst 
 For the last battle of wills between me and evil manifest 
 As I wander through the corridor the horrid gore 
 Conjures all the awful thing I've done I'm sorry for 
 I'm not an omnivore but I was one before the food chain collapsed 
 I saw my colleagues' innards on the floor 
 But bring it if this ugly motherfucker wants some more 
 You're just one deformed ponce with a pompadour 
 This is survival of the fittest 
 Survival of the vicious 
 Survival of the wickedest and sickest 
 This is survival of the fittest 
 Survival of the vicious 
 Survival of the wickedest and sickest 
 This is survival of the fittest 
 Survival of the vicious 
 Survival of the wickedest and sickest 
 This is survival of the fittest 
 Survival of the vicious 
 Survival of the wickedest

 In space, nobody can hear you scream 
 In space, nobody can hear you scream 
 In space, nobody can hear you scream 
 In space, scream all you like
