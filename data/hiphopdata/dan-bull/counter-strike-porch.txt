Smash through the gates of the nuclear plant 
 Not just some dudes in a van, we're goin' through with a plan 
 Maximum impact's the thing that we're after 
 We're gonna bring back the Big Bang Disaster 
 These guys are contriving a crime of the violentest type 
 We'll find them inside, we must deny them this crisis in time 
 Christ, there are five, so be quiet and hide 
 Because silence is vital when tryin' to surprise 
 You want to die or survive in the prime of your life? 
 'Cause this moment your time to decide 
 Get ready to open fire and fight 
 But not till you spy the whites of their eyes 
 Nice 
 Got him right in the side with a sawed-off 
 Cripes 
 He well nigh blew my balls off 
 There's a sniper up high and we might be too late 
 I'll provide cover fire 
 You tryin' to escape 
 Yo, lock and then load 
 You're about to die 
 Stop the bomb from explodin' in Counter-Strike 
 I said, lock and then load 
 You're about to die 
 Stop the bomb from explodin' in Counter-Strike 
 Boom! Headshot 
 Fock your mom 
 Aagh, you dropped the bomb! 
 Mate what, come on? 
 Make your move 
 Wait too long 
 Too late, you lose 
 Not so fast, man 
 Watch when I throw this 
 Holy crap! It's a flashbang! 
 Oh shit! 
 I'll be laughin' when you all die 
 Your number's up, M249 
 Agh! 
 He's got the aforementioned gun! 
 Take cover, aim another grenade 
 What the-? 
 I set us up the bomb 
 Several seconds and it's gone 
 We'd better bloody run 
 They're wrecking it, come on 
 Fancy a cocktail? 
 I can make a molotov 
 Agh! 
 This is gonna burn the hair on my bollock off! 
 Yo, lock and then load 
 You're about to die 
 Stop the bomb from explodin' in Counter-Strike 
 I said, lock and then load 
 You're about to die 
 Stop the bomb from explodin' in Counter-Strike
