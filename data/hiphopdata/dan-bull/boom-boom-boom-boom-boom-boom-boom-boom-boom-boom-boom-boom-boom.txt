I'm a creeper, Minecraft's Grim Reaper 
 Blowing up blocks like Al-Qaeda 
 I'm not a creature that'll eat ya 
 But I'll leave you petrified 
 Peter, remind the peeps of Minesweeper 
 Clickin' on a brick then you die in the deep 
 I'll find you're mine I'm a mind reader 
 Now the mine is mine, it's finders keepers 
 "Oh hai , I'm a Creeper, so nice, nice to meet ya 
 Is that the time? It's time to leave 
 And tick, tock, tick, tock" 
 Boom boom boom 
 I can't stop singin' this bloody 
 Tune tune tune 
 It's gonna make my brain go 
 Boom boom boom 
 I can't stop singin' this bloody 
 Tune tune tune 
 (Boom, boom boom) 
 I do what I wanna, move aside, Mama 
 Tick tick, I'm a suicide bomba 
 I take control then I'm gonna 
 Leave a gaping hole, Belladonna 
 That'll take its toll when I'm on a quest to invade 
 Detonate your soul, fizz like a lemonade then blow 
 So you'd better stay indoors or I'll find you're mine 
 When you're minin' ore, you'll be dyin' 
 Lyin' in gore, darling, aww, what you cryin' for? 
 Did somebody break your diamond sword? 
 I'm the volatilest sort, what a violent force 
 That'll frighten Spartans, hark and hear Leonidas talk 
 When he sees me, "Tonight we dine indoors!" 
 Boom boom boom 
 I can't stop singin' this bloody 
 Tune tune tune 
 It's gonna make my brain go 
 Boom boom boom 
 I can't stop singin' this bloody 
 Tune tune tune 
 It's official, a ballistic missile 
 Couldn't get this result 
 I blow through stone like a six foot chisel 
 So you'd better shiver when you hear that sizzle 
 Fo shizzle, take a listen 
 It's a premonition of my mission 
 Death by demolition, if I don't come home 
 There's a sign in my kitchen 
 To describe why I'm missin'; "Gone fission" 
 White hot raps, I got stacks 
 Sometimes when I die, I drop tracks 
 I got a lot, ocelot, fight off cats 
 If I'm feeling nice, then I might not... blast 
 Boom boom boom 
 I can't stop singin' this bloody 
 Tune tune tune 
 It's gonna make my brain go 
 Boom boom boom 
 I can't stop singin' this bloody 
 Tune tune tune 
 My hobbies and interests include going 
 Boom Boom Boom
