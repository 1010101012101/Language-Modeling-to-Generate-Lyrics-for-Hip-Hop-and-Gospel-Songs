Left to fester in a prison cell 
 This is livin' hell 
 But I've never been a fellow to just sit and dwell 
 On how they set me up 
 Said I killed the empress 
 My will for vengeance 
 Somewhat similar to my skills: it's endless 
 Distill the tension 
 Build momentum 
 Till the thrill's tremendous 
 I'm going to bring a world of pain to them 
 That's real relentless 
 They'll feel horrendous in their final living seconds 
 A cold breath on their shoulder as death beckons 
 And shows them in this most fleeting of moments 
 There's no grave 
 Their remains are feeding the rodents 
 Now those close to them 
 Are grieving and broken 
 I leave the bereaved 
 With my deepest condolence 
 That's one more completed atonement 
 Closer to the Lord Regent 
 My meanest opponent 
 He's a treasonous Caesarless Brutus 
 Jesus, he's the evilest elitist Judas 
 He is leaving us diseased 
 I don't believe it's Lupus 
 These streets are heaving with the Weepers 
 Who are really ruthless 
 The old boys' club in an all-boys school 
 They control all of Dunwall 
 The Tallboys rule 
 I'm after Lady Boyle 
 So pass the baby oil 
 You need your nappy changin', man 
 My rappin' made you soil 
 Defecation 
 From a blend of dread and veneration 
 Of an assassinatin' rapper's devastation 
 A declaration 
 Destination: desolation 
 Defamation of your delegation 
 Desecration, desperation 
 A dedication 
 To the depravating, deformating 
 Depredation of your nation 
 Detonation 
 My reputation precedes me 
 Like I was played in a demonstration at E3 
 You couldn't easily beat me 
 I rake in loads of bone charms 
 Believe me, I'm beastly 
 I'll break your bones in both arms 
 Tonight 
 I'm bringing Dunwall to life 
 As I walk on water 
 Through Walls of Light 
 You heard the king 
 As the urchins sing 
 Revenge solves everything 
 Tonight 
 I'm bringing Dunwall to life 
 As I walk on water 
 Through Walls of Light 
 You heard the king 
 As the urchins sing 
 Revenge solves everything 
 Tonight 
 I'm bringing Dunwall to life 
 As I walk on water 
 Through Walls of Light 
 You heard the king 
 As the urchins sing 
 Revenge solves everything 
 Tonight 
 I'm bringing Dunwall to life 
 As I walk on water 
 Through Walls of Light 
 You heard the king 
 As the urchins sing 
 Revenge solves everything 
 Tonight 
 I'm bringing Dunwall to life 
 As I walk on water 
 Through walls of light 
 You heard the king 
 As the urchins sing 
 Revenge solves everything
