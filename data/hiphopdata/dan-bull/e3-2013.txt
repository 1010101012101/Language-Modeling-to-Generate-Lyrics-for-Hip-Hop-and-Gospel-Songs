 We're on a plane to L.A. and we're never going to stop 
 Beatboxing with my ear when the drum goes pop 
 Horrible zombies and hurtful plants 
 So we're going to need a World of Tanks 
 As you can see I'm not quite as tall as this robot from Titanfall 
 If you don't like The Witcher, you can probably dismiss this 
 But I just got a lolly from witches 
 We're about to get onto the escalator 
 You haven't got a pass, so I'll check you later 
 People in queues? Flipping sod those 
 Get out of my way, like fish in C.O.D. Ghosts 
 They've been queueing for t-shirts since yesterday 
 Looks like it's going to be their Destiny 
 What's in the next M.G.S.? Only Snake'll know 
 Castlevania looks like A Game of Thrones 
 Elder Scrolls is amazing, no lag at all 
 I'm holding the mace of Molag Bal 
 Bethesda is repping Elder Scrolls Online 
 But don't forget about Wolfenstein 
 Activision are back to back with Blizzard 
 Dat division 
 Toby Turner 
 I'm freestyling, my style is free 
 Actually, I, I paid a fee 
 For the clothes that you see, I'm here at E3 2013 
 You know what I mean, 'cause I said it in English, Mm-hmmm 
 Sometimes I sing-lish, woo hoo hoo hoo ho 
 For no reason, singing singing for no reason 
 It's the season, for the re... treason 
 That rhymes, mother...

 Man, my rhymes are tighter than Busta's 
 Standing side to side with Tobuscus 
 Sonic at the top like a boss hog 
 Everybody's getting watched like in Watch Dogs 
 Xbox privacy? That is a delusion 
 Fake, Mickey Mouse, Castle of Illusion 
 I burnt my forehead, it's pink as Hell 
 I should have kept undercover, Splinter Cell 
 Diablo III'll make me crazy and scared 
 Like I've just seen an alien, where? 
 I've been bitten by a zombie, that'll feel raw 
 So what am I still on the Battlefield for? 
 Soon it's going to be a dark night, Batman 
 Let's go, I'm hungry, Pac-Man
