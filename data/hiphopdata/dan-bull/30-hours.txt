Thirty hours ago I was very slow 
 At trimming my afro which I don't have 'cause I'm Caucasian 
 And it's very rare for a Caucasian to have an afro 
 Maybe a Jewish person might, do Jewish people count as Caucasian? 
 Not sure, but so you know sometimes they have 
 That really sort of curly hair 
 Sometimes it's known as a "Jewfro" 
 Perhaps not the most politically incorre-sorry 
 The most politically correct term but there you go 
 That's what it's known as in common parts 
 Anyway, where was I? 
 But what was the song title? 
 Oh, "30 Hours", I'm not doing it for that long
