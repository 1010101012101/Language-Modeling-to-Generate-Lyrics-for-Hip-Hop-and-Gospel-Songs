Mass Effect 
 I'm Commander Shepard 
 The man with the method 
 To brandish a weapon 
 And then handle the geth with it 
 I'm an effortless hero 
 My rhymes shines brighter than Element Zero 
 Bringing more fire than Emperor Nero 
 It's the end of an era, yo! 
 There's something mysterious with Saren Arterius 
 Committing violence against Nihlus 
 I'm furious 
 I'll chase him from place to place 
 Base to base 
 Until we're face to face 
 I'm serious 
 From the Sirius Relay to Artemis Tau 
 I'll tighten the net, I'm not far from him now 
 I'll fight all the geth till that bastard is found 
 And leave his heart in the ground 
 I'm the southpaw outlaw scoundrel 
 Bringing down more tools than a whole ground force 
 Listen out now, fool 
 It's pretty damn doubtful 
 That I'll be sitting down with the Citadel Council 
 The Reapers are keen to bring about your downfall 
 So me and my team are about to flout laws 
 I'll introduce to the whole of my party 
 Garrus, Liara T'Soni and Tali 
 Wrex, Kaiden, Ashley, Joker, the Army 
 You roll with an asari 
 Older than Atari 
 A krogan that'll leave you cold within a heartbeat 
 My team's hotter than a stolen Ferrari 
 Can a volus go shoulder to shoulder with me? 
 Hardly 
 My ship's seen off more foes than a Somali's 
 So we're going on safari 
 To the far reaches, it'll be gnarly 
 Seeing stranger creations than Dal√≠ 
 And breaking more faces than Arnie 
 Mass Effect 2 
 Blown to pieces 
 And reassembled 
 I don't believe this 
 It's bleeding mental 
 But then again, with these credentials 
 Can they be blamed for believin' me essential 
 I don't want to be nervously lunchin' with Cerberus 
 I'd prefer to be punchin' a journalist 
 Soupin' up all my guns for the skirmishes 
 In which I'll puncture the firmament 
 Permanent 
 I'm bringin' a lyrical Mass Effect 
 My skill it'd kill a million billion massive geth 
 Commander Shepard's formidable syllables 
 Hitting the pinnacle, it's a miracle 
 That commands mass respect 
 Incontestable, I'm a professional 
 But my new boss is less than respectable 
 So you better cover up your testicles 
 'Cause my next method's something of a spectacle 
 More fresh and raw 
 Than a vegetable 
 Coming from the underground 
 With the hunger of a Thresher Maw 
 I leave the rachni with a black eye 
 Slap pyjaks with a backhand 
 Never act nice 
 Rap lines sharper than cacti 
 Or the bite of a varren on a barren planet 
 Baptized in flame 
 Rise again 
 In fact, I'm insane 
 Providing pain, back from the afterlife 
 Packin' an appetite to invade 
 This ain't a drivin' range 
 But I'll leave you with eighteen holes 
 Inside of your brain 
 Like a Swiss cheese 
 Bitch, please 
 You'll disbelieve the manner in which I kick frees 
 Bringing Sci-Fi to your Hi-Fi 
 Is the highlight of your lifetime 
 With ease 
 This is just the beginning
