We learned to band together and endeavor 
 Clasp our hands together, man developed language, letters 
 An incredible advantage, getting plans together 
 But would we stand the test of time 
 Against the planet's reckless climate 
 And its angry weather? 
 Spread the sails and head west against the gales 
 And storms aboard Norse longboats with decks as dense as nails 
 Our aim was riding waves and finding, claiming strange horizons 
 Invading islands, native populations slain with violence 
 Enslaved and made to aim skyward, think of bigger things 
 Sphinxes, pyramids, raise them high in the name of different kings 
 The different things we've held sacred, divine, through places and times 
 The range of supplications and rites, through ages we find 
 Nations arise as old civilizations crumble to dust 
 Becoming strangers in time, waiting to die 
 Replaced in the night, the day breaks and the light 
 Changes illuminating newer human faces as fights rage 
 The human race is facing the might of righteous states who would write 
 The history books even if it took a knife's blade 
 To find the right page, Sengoku Jidai 
 Men offered to die for the honor of a warrior's life 
 The sun's coming and we're watching it rise 
 As a new era's here, it's as solid as iron 
 Pull the tongs from the fire, strike the hammer to the anvil 
 Craft a weapon to bring an enemy to a standstill 
 The blacksmith is the wizard that gives us 
 These powers devour enemies, leaping down from the siege towers 
 The better the tech is, the lesser the effort to wreck it 
 The less time to see their eyes and feel sympathetic 
 Never regret it, a true knight never stays a true blade 
 Never says touch√© but would forever lay in blue rays of weathered glades 
 To demonstrate his never-ending dedication to the crusade 
 Reformation through flame and after the cremation is a new age 
 Time's quill is quick to spill its ink onto a new page 
 The faces are the same as when in days gone 
 But brains are cultivated thus creating the Renaissance 
 We're still using steel tools to stay strong 
 Replacing blades with greater trades, pen and paper, song 
 Faith in God is tested, hiding in the desert 
 Men excited, then enlightened by the scientific method 
 Tried describing its expression by inscribing his impression 
 When applying it to heavenly bodies that everybody reckoned 
 Must have been made by a Creator or a greater force 
 Nature's author faced examination never faced before 
 The grace of horse and rider, replaced by wars and violence 
 Debased the laws of science, made the case for all the pious 
 Why is it progress always leads to loads of mess? 
 The western region spread across the globe and coalesced 
 Settlers spread disease with effortless ease 
 Was it reckless or did it just happen inevitably? 
 While evidently we never can see through the lens of this century 
 But there's no retreating now, whether or not it was meant to be 
 The seven seas were sailed, navies prevailed 
 Leaving trails of devastation in their wake as people wailed 
 A world of wonder plundered, traded in the name of progress 
 But human nature's way shows we should expect no less 
 Oh yes, struck by the realisation this is just civilization 
 In the natal stages of industrialization, trust me when I say 
 That previous achievements are just child's play 
 Compared to this colossal school of thought 
 We set the world ablaze with fossil fuel we bought, it's an epiphany 
 Giving us pretty much infinite energy, it's electricity 
 Edison, Nikola Tesla, different inventors giving us everything we depend on 
 Whether it's engines, cinema, television or telecoms 
 Sending a message and spreading it on, these unreal frontier channels 
 We develop the tech and then sell it on, the reel travels round 
 With the speed of a machine gun's barrels 
 Machinery's a meaner beast and we're still in the saddle 
 No need for cavalry, battle superseded that with ease 
 Allies and Axis, charging each other like batteries 
 A power vacuum allowing the superstates to flourish 
 Redistribute the food even if it means people are malnourished 
 Propaganda is the only view that you're allowed to publish 
 'Cause totalitarians are well aware of how to punish 
 Gunning down numbers countless for doubtless nothings that they've done 
 But that won't stop subversive insurgents from coming out with courage 
 Using their power to the fullest, whether creativity or demonstrating general relativity 
 Evidently when we find time to be efficient 
 Einsteinian clear vision can reveal the precision behind the blinds, nuclear fission 
 Despite derision, physicists decide the mission is dividing, splitting atoms 
 Till a blinding light is given, quite efficient 
 The divine right to mankind's plight is christened 
 A minor decision hijacked by politicians 
 But as long as they listen to the will of the people 
 Treat all as brilliant equals, we can achieve more 
 Than we've ever conceived before 
 Leave this poor place, please explore space 
 Earth, she's a small base, even more awaits 
 I implore great leaders to lead with all the grace 
 Of which we're capable and be the author of your fate 
 Band together and endeavour, clasp our hands together 
 As our ancestors have and stand the test of time forever
