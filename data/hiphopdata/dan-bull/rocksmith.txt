Hah, yeah, look 
 When I was little I wanted to be a rockstar 
 But I thought playing guitar would be rock hard 
 Taught myself a couple of chords but never got far 
 So instead I picked a mic up and dropped bars 
 And I've done alright, my rhymes are more tight 
 Than the average, I tell you that isn't a pork pie 
 But please give me a minute, let me be forthright 
 I wish I'd had the foresight to give my fingers more time 
 Instead I let them get bored on the fretboard 
 But now I've found a course and got it cracked like a fault line 
 I learnt less in all my life than in the last fortnight 
 Propelled my elevation level as if it was cordite 
 Now I can hack at my axe, and rock it all night 
 If rock is a thrill ride, then Rocksmith's your tour guide 
 Of course I've still got to put the time into it 
 But the fact is with practice, I know I can do it 
 Now I'm a Rocksmith, I learned a lot quick 
 Never mind pressing buttons, I know how to pluck strings 
 Now I'm a Rocksmith, I learned a lot quick 
 I never dreamed, I'd be able to play such things 
 Unlike The Deftones, I was tone Def 
 Leppards never change their spots, I'm just a Radiohead 
 Music left me with an Aching Head, not a head Rush 
 Crimson red blush, less trust then Jeb Bush 
 I'm not an EarlyRiser, could never Rise Against 
 The procrastination, it was always I Versus Them 
 I couldn't find a Muse, or iron out The Kinks 
 I could Kiss goodbye to Screaming Females, I was jinxed 
 Wanted to slay 'em like I'm waving a katana 
 Or Magic Wands, make a Splashh, take them to Nirvana 
 Play in my pyjamas, as heavy as a Monster Truck 
 Never mind The Who, what, why, no-one wants to suck 
 The Police in Boston aren't even as tough as this 
 RSI, callouses and blisters, I've suffered it 
 But I'll never stop playing guitar 
 Until All That Remains of my nails are scars 
 Now I'm a Rocksmith, I learned a lot quick 
 Never mind pressing buttons, I know how to pluck strings 
 Now I'm a Rocksmith, I learned a lot quick 
 I never dreamed, I'd be able to play such things 
 Now I'm a Rocksmith, I learned a lot quick 
 Never mind pressing buttons, I know how to pluck strings 
 Now I'm a Rocksmith, I learned a lot quick 
 I never dreamed, I'd be able to play such things
