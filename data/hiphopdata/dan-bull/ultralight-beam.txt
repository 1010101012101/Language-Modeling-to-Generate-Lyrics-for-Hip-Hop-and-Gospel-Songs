Ladies and gentlemen 
 Welcome to the start of the greatest album of all time 
 The Life of Pablo 
 A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four 
 Ultralight beam, ultralight beam 
 Ultralight beam, ultralight beam 
 Ultralight beam, ultralight beam 
 Ultra-ultra-ultralight beam 
 Ultralight beam, ultralight beam 
 Ultralight beam, ultralight beam 
 An ultralight beam ain't what it seems 
 And if you're not down in my team then you're leem 
 And by leem I mean lame but it didn't quite rhame 
 It didn't quite rhyme, I'm in the right frame of mind, eh
