Hmm, so 
 Another E3 
 Another hard year 
 Less about games 
 This time about hardware 
 Sony announce PlayStation Move 
 Which is apparently some kind of luminous spoon 
 And it wasn't inspired 
 Or had anything to do 
 With the Wiimote 
 Remotely, I promise you 
 Then Kinect got shown off on the Xbox 
 Yet another extra add-on at an extra cost 
 Nintendo announced 3DS 
 That lets you see 3D without 3D specs 
 Who wants the reason for all this E3 tech 
 When there hasn't even been a decent game released yet? 
 Remember when gaming was about, well, gaming? 
 Not jumpin' up and down in your lounge and waving 
 It's like every year we see the same things 
 "Aliens seize earth and face off against space marines!" 
 Well, the whole gamin' scene yawns and waits to see 
 Whether any of the developers have any innovation up their sleeves 
 But it seems not 
 And that's a shame to me 
 Maybe I should just shut up 
 And wave at my TV 
 Please 
 Let's see somethin' better at next year's E3
