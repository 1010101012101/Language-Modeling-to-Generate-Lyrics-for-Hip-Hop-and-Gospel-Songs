Listen up, the title of the song is, uh, "Facts" 
 And, uh, as a result of said title I suppose I ought to 
 Divulge a couple of facts myself 
 Did you know 
 That the earth is not actually round? 
 It's a pyramid 
 Did you know 
 That the mating call of the common housefly is this 
 "Come here, little..." 
 Did you know 
 That when biscuits go soggy 
 It's not always due to moisture in the air? 
 It's actually moisture within the biscuit 
 Moving and making the biscuit soggy 
 Alternatively, it's because a group of boys have gathered 'round and 
 Played some sort of competitive sport 
 Of which I shall not disclose the details here, perhaps another time 
 Did you know 
 That the word "fluff" is spelled F-L-U-P-H? 
 It's one of the most commonly misspelled words in, in, in, in English 
 Did you know 
 That this is not, not the end of this track?
