I'm smacking a man with a baton in hand 
 That is the plan, blasting a gat at a gang 
 Quick, bang, bang, bang, no matter how fast they ran 
 I'm packing the baddest of backup plans 
 Attackers, I hack them and transfer the data then 
 Crack with the elbow the prat has just fell over 
 Blast 'til the last man stands, click 
 The flick of a switch, the sprinkler spits 
 An image of somebody nibbling fish 
 Using a chick as a dish, this is ridiculous shit 
 Call it tomfoolery, who's that girl? The one with the jewellery 
 I'm sneaking up on any fool that be 
 Foolish enough to believe he's as cool as me 
 Popping a shot in his noggin and holding a hostage 
 Who folded and told so I hold off from offing him dead 
 One shot in the leg and walk off as he begs 
 Now the coppers have entered the scene 
 I've left them and fled as I head to the street 
 Thinking they got me but I'm not backing down 
 Stop the clock and the city is blacking out 
 Lagging out, I'll grab you now 
 You panic as I ram a police man into the ground 
 And now they've gone and found the human trafficker 
 The Superman with the computer 
 Is after you pursuing and hacking you 
 Wherever you go I own every zone 
 Heavily loaded with loads of the cleverest pro kit 
 Wrecking the road with my tech as my phone 
 Glitches a second of code into the system 
 And I'm dressed up as a regular Joe in regular clothes 
 And nobody could ever expose it, oh shit 
 I'm ready to just rev and then go, begin 
 Ever so slow then wait to accelerate whenever the moment is 
 (Go) 
 Wait, wait, wait 
 I'm ready I'm going in 
 Picking up a ticket for the method of my driving? 
 Nah, I'm skiving, I am wickeder than wicked 
 And I take it into hiding 
 Quicker than a whippet in west riding 
 Whipping out the whip, it's hide and seek 
 Quick, let's whip inside and see 
 If I can divine a unique 
 Design that'll silently peek 
 Behind every blind so I can provide 
 Any enemy with a violent surprise 
 Survey the scene, it's Aiden Pearce 
 Don't care who your agency is 
 You're facing the meanest surveillance genius 
 Leave an imprint of your face in the street 
 Just DDoSing, CtOS and tossing them in the sea 
 'Cause I'm an MC, constantly watching and seeking 
 So watch what you're speaking 
 Stopping a chopper from dropping a spot 
 In the spot that I be in, got to be leaving 
 Pealing off on my feet like socks on a hot day 
 Leaping off of the bar 
 Ah, good evening, officer I just need to see the bars 
 I've got on my phone and leave you lot in the dark 
 Now the city's power is ours 
 And I'm devouring it stopping the heart 
 I'm on a boat, it's obvious I'm a boss hog 
 Watch Dog, watching the watchers I've got to log off
