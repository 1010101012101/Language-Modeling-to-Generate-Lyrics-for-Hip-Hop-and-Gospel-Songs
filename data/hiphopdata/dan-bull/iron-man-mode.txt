Computer games are gettin' too easy these days (Why?) 
 For each mistake we just reload and resave 
 In the meek way that they were never meant to be played 
 We need to cease placin' emphasis on Seagate 
 Be brave, and implement a higher plan, of gaming and never saving 
 The name is Iron Man 
 I want an adrenaline overload 
 Iron Man Mode, Iron Man Mode 
 Never save gameplay, never reload 
 Iron Man Mode, Iron Man Mode 
 If there is no risk, then there's no reward 
 Slave to the save, throw your overlords overboard 
 Computer mutiny through the screen's new to me 
 Dan and a cannon canning any man that shoots at me 
 Napoleonic flows Bonaparte 
 Leaving loads of foes blown apart 
 No comeback Kenobi, Obi-Wan 
 For one life only, lonely heart 
 No reloadin', you can only restart 
 This is Iron Man Mode and I am Tony Stark 
 Ha! 
 I want an adrenaline overload 
 Iron Man Mode, Iron Man Mode 
 Never save gameplay, never reload 
 Iron Man Mode, Iron Man Mode 
 You'll realize real life is irreplaceable 
 No three strikes; this isn't baseball 
 Your bones are breakable, your foes'll break 'em all 
 They'll take the opportunity by any means available 
 To demonstrate that your remains are quite biodegradable 
 If you're incapable to comprehend mortality 
 I advocate the remedy of permanent fatality 
 I want an adrenaline overload 
 Iron Man Mode, Iron Man Mode 
 Never save gameplay, never reload 
 Iron Man Mode, Iron Man Mode 
 I want an adrenaline overload 
 Iron Man Mode, Iron Man Mode 
 Never save gameplay, never reload 
 Iron Man Mode, Iron Man Mode 
 It's time that gamers got their balls back 
 Who's with me? 
 Put your balls in the air if you're with me!
