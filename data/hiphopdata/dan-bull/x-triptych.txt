Welcome to the next generation 
 Man, I feel like a superstar in a high powered supercar 
 Shoot for the stars, no stopping me, I'm revving up a cacophony 
 Doesn't matter whatever you offer me 
 Won't swap it for anything, honestly 
 The road ahead of me's calling 
 And pole position is where I've just got to be 
 I'm an ace in a race, set a pace 
 That'll take you to a range of places 
 Make you say, "Ooh, great, amazing" 
 A trail in my wake as I blaze away 
 'Cause it's the way that I make my paper 
 Do me a favour: Get out of my way, bruh 
 Boy racer with places to be 
 So it's safe to say I'll see you later 
 Forza Motorsport, will open doors to a sort of ocean port 
 That'll flow a course from coast to shores, the poetry of motion's yours 
 Saddle up, we're going on tour, you'll ride astride your chosen horse 
 Through a load of applause, such force 
 You were only supposed to blow the doors 
 Horsepower, galloping gallantly, shoot for the stars, Galileo Galilei 
 Hey! Don't prang my McClaren, geez, the tab to patch up the damage 
 Is grand as your annual salary and apparently you just cannot handle me 
 So hand me the keys as I shoot for the stars blasting these supercars 
 To a brand new galaxy 
 Yeah, uh, yeah 
 Let's go 
 There's dead on every street, the city's a cemetery 
 So evidently, you better believe it's better to get up and leave 
 If that's something you'll ever achieve 
 Well then you will need to get a bit mean 
 With the endless sea of horrendous beings 
 That'll see your flesh as a delicacy 
 They want to find out how your meat tastes 
 One bite is all it takes 
 Should you make a small mistake 
 They'll make you their next gourmet steak 
 The stakes have been raised, son 
 Can you stave the invasion? 
 From the cradle to the grave, you'll save 
 All walks of life and death when you slay them 
 I'll make tools, then I slay fools 
 Though I break rules, stay faithful 
 To the label of a fellow cutting straight through you 
 From the nape of the neck to the navel 
 Maybe it's painful, maybe it's not 
 I don't know, your brains are all rotten 
 And though you may have forgotten the way that it was 
 I won't let you forget when I take you to God 
 With a homemade blade aimed straight at your schnoz 
 I don't suppose there'll be that much tissue left 
 To let you blow your nose 
 And so it goes on, the contagion continues 
 It'll blatantly take every grain of the patience 
 And latent frustration that's waiting within you 
 Skill 
 Yeah, uh, yeah 
 Let's take it back 
 Rome, the place I name as my home 
 Made it my own and I'll die before I see it overthrown 
 I'm one of the most valiant fighters, I'm known as Marius Titus 
 This city's in my blood as valuable as my life is 
 With all of the troops, Legions at hand 
 We're ruling a huge region of land 
 Reaching through France and even Britannia 
 And for that, we've Caesar to thank 
 For seizing it and I think of the man 
 When I'm leading a siege and I see that the ranks 
 Are in need of command, eager to mangle 
 A people as weak as we are grand 
 Ryse 
 This isn't my kind of war, the thing that I'm fighting for 
 Gibbon's Decline and Fall didn't begin describing all 
 The wicked things that Titus saw, his sight is raw, his eyes are sore 
 Lives withdrawn with violent force, civilian killing with knives and swords 
 Now my kids and wife are torn asunder, souls all but plundered 
 I hunger for vengeance on the men responsible, I've called their number 
 I'm a lord of thunder striding right in with the force and might 
 Of lightning strikes, I will never bore or tire 
 Of war or fighting, Ryse
