Look at my dog tag! 
 You'll see D. Bull 
 A heavy hitter from the Midlands 
 Like Led Zep have reformed 
 I don't need the Marine Corps 
 I'm lethal, from 3,000 miles 
 Off the eastern seaboard 
 Colder than Trebor mints, Nee Naw 
 K People step away from the keyboard 
 I wanna see your heads bopping see saw 
 Up and down so speedy 
 You're reelin' from the G-force 
 Give me a vehicle 
 A BMD or Super Hornet 
 Troops are fallin' 
 Uniformed superiors are fearful 
 I'm really tearful 
 Saline solution, slides from my eyes 
 At the same time I'm shootin' 
 So maybe I just should 
 Let a Beretta do the talkin' 
 'Cause after all 
 You're a dead man walkin' 
 I walk in, pull out my M1014 
 And end all these porkies, and tall stories 
 With the ease of a nuclear attack 
 I shout "Look behind you" 
 And shoot you in the back 
 Suited up with flak jackets, flashbangin' 
 Leaving claymores in your path 
 Need I say more? 
 This is the Battlefield 
 Where if you lack the skill 
 Than your cap'll peel back 
 Like an apple peal, twat 
 In the Battlefield 
 If you lack the skill 
 Than your cap'll peel 
 Like an apple peal 
 So grab the steel 
 You're a super soaker 
 I'm a super cobra 
 Soupin' up my guns 
 Till I become a supernova 
 I'll take you to the moon 
 And over like a lunar rover 
 I got a new limo 
 And so are you the chauffeur? 
 I'm a human Yoda 
 No, a new Jehovah 
 I do my flows with the devotion 
 Of a Jew to Kosher 
 So I shot the charcuter and do him over 
 I'll do to you what 
 You've seen me do to SOPA 
 I'll straight flush you 
 Like a full suit in poker 
 And mutilate you leavin' you 
 Lookin' like you're doing yoga 
 Resume control, assume the role 
 Of Henry "Black" Blackburn 
 I'm coming for your guts 
 Like a freakin' flatworm 
 Soon as your back's turned 
 Blackburn'll blast murder fast 
 I'm packing more heat 
 Than a massive thermostat 
 I've got a certain knack 
 To turn the gas 
 And hurl a match 
 So if you'd prefer to lack a burn 
 Then stand further back 
 And I slap bureaucrats 
 That haven't heard the facts 
 I'm rappin' more original 
 Than a frickin' Werther's Pack 
 I mix hardcore, nerdcore, commercial rap 
 And stay on top of the beef 
 Like a burger bap 
 I'm a soldier 
 But not the sort to traverse Iraq 
 I'll come first in any match 
 On 30 racks of server stacks 
 I serve a purpose 
 That you might find confusing 
 Dicing right through 
 The digital illusion of the 
 Battlefield 
 Where if you lack the skill 
 Than your cap'll peel back 
 Like an apple peal, twat 
 In the Battlefield 
 If you lack the skill 
 Than your cap'll peel 
 Like an apple peal 
 So grab the steel
