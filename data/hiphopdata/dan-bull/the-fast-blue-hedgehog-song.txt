Put on my red shoes and fasten up the buckles 
 Flex and stretch my legs, oh so supple 
 Call Amy, Tails and Knuckles 
 We're ready for a scuffle and feathers'll be ruffled 
 Amy Rose is a lady that knows 
 How to handle a hammer, she's aiming the blows 
 There ain't no evading the throws 
 With one little tap she's breaking your nose 
 Tails sails through the air like a gale 
 With chaos trying to take him down to no avail 
 He'll scale hills and vales, valleys and mountains till we prevail 
 Knuckles is a though old echidna 
 How he got so big's an enigma 
 As a unit they're lifting the stigma 
 That woodland creatures have little charisma 
 Spikes on my back strike and attack 
 Any lyre, boa, mamba, python or asp 
 Which type of life's even faster than light? 
 You're frightened to ask, it is I 
 I'm the supersonic Sonic and I'm on it 
 Like a comet at velocities that makes you want vomit 
 Breaking your sound barrier like a grommet 
 Would they ever stop me? Far from it 
 I'm running to the summit, I'm honest, that's a promise 
 On every gold ring that I've got within my wallet 
 Bling, got to get those rings, spread those wings 
 And wreck those tings, disinfect those stings 
 I'm a retro link to the future, electro swing 
 Being blue, sir, is the next big thing 
 There's a spring in my step so let's go, thrilling 
 There's a pillock named Lyric and he's going to get it 
 He'll feel the force of everything were going to give him 
 The biggest of his wishes is to kick us off the rhythm 
 But were never going to give in, never going to let him 
 He's never going to get anything that he threatened, whatever the weapon 
 We're old school so we're prepping a lesson 
 He'll learn that we're never subject to aggression 
 We're the woodland creatures with grand features 
 That'll make you scream from the bleachers 
 Bringing heat like a fever with elite beats 
 That'll give your speakers seizures 
 DBs exceeding the reading of the meters 
 Till you're pleading for a breather 
 While we just beat snake egg enemies to the ether 
 Oh, I'm a blue flame bolt 
 Oh, I'm a blue flame bolt 
 Oh, I'm a blue flame bolt 
 Screw Usain Bolt, I'm a blue flame bolt 
 Oh, I'm a blue flame bolt 
 Oh, I'm a blue flame bolt 
 Oh, I'm a blue flame bolt 
 Screw Usain Bolt, I'm a blue flame bolt 
 I'm a, I'm a, I'm a blue flame bolt 
 And a Hedgehog
