Good to meet you, cordial greetings, they call me Gordon Freeman 
 And up until this morning I was an ordinary normal human 
 Eating and reading the ingredients on a box of cereals 
 Then heading off to the Office of Anomalous Materials 
 Realise I'm late so I'll have to catch you later 
 Gotta catch a train to Black Mesa's anti-mass chamber 
 Put on my hazmat in case the vat breaks 'cause that's dangerous 
 You'd have to evade the blast radius of a resonance cascade that's 
 The last stage of, ah, ah, it's, it's actually, it's actually happening 
 Th-this is not good! This is, shit 
 Wake up in the chamber with a bad head, everybody in the lab dead 
 I better had fled, this is dead rad, get it? Dead rad, hit a headcrab 
 With a crowbar, I'm a lonestar, yo, guard, gotta go, but I'll owe you a postcard 
 Oh darn, life is so hard, with no halves, let alone half, like a diet with low carbs 
 But I like it so far, life now has a worth and a purpose 
 Find out what on earth is occurring, wipe out any vermin that's stirring 
 Fly now to the surface and hurry, there's a person that's lurking, queer 
 Think I've seen him working here 
 Gee, man, I'm not really certain what he's observing 
 But I'm going to persevere, though I'm merely an engineer 
 I'll end your career 
 G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Man 
 F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Freeman 
 G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Man 
 F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Freeman 
 Damn, everybody's after me, guess that's the way it has to be 
 From Black Ops to G-Man and all these dastardly 
 Bastard beings, masked marines, I'm blasting things with SPAS-12s 
 Then take a break to recharge my shield and grab health 
 Electric impulses convulse with the most violent sound 
 Sending houndeyes to the pound, firing rounds 
 Sliding round mines, if life has half a meaning, well I've found mine 
 Bouncing through the sky so high that I'm on cloud nine 
 Low gravity provides some downtime to hit the ground 
 I am bringing down giants as if they're fricking houseflies 
 Hitch a ride inside a monorail car, swinging off a tentacle like ah 
 I get in the ring with anybody, man, who's on next? 
 I'll wreck you, trekking from the land of Xen to Lambda Complex 
 Hang on one sec, I think I've got the wrong specs 
 That baby looks gargantuan, these lenses can't be convex 
 Imagine the conception; that must have been some sex 
 Not to mention giving birth to it; how much can bums stretch? 
 But enough talk of proportions and awkward contortions 
 To pull the portal shut calls for the goriest abortion 
 (Too far)
