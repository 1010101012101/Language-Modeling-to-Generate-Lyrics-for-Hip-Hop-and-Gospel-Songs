Mass panic 
 (Where are we?) 
 , crash landed on a barren planet 
 Tau Volantis, God's sake, how romantic 
 Look out for Danik, the Unitologists are on a ship 
 And if you spot them then use your hollow tips 
 While human colonists seek the codex key 
 Who's the musicologist's new foe? That's me 
 Rewriting rhyme science, Isaac Clarke 
 My lines shine like eyes in the dark 
 Mines in the vast reaches of deep space 
 Are the reason that I came to be in this bleak place 
 But to keep my spirits up I keep lacing the beat 
 With words that deserve a million replays 
 Till I beat the game on every difficulty 
 Pitifully, leaving you amazed at my skill 
 Now could we open the electric doors 
 And let me get debauched with the Necromorphs 
 Until the Nexus falls, I bet you've all 
 Never seen a pair of balls as heavy as my testicles 
 I walk the walk, I'm one of the nastiest trash talkers 
 Attack Crawlers and Swarmers, blast Stalkers 
 I go berserk at Lurkers, turn them into burgers 
 I murder Pukers, use their mucus as a gherkin in a bap 
 Amidst the battle I'll be working on my rap 
 To refute your version of the facts 
 Plasmatic fluid all curdling 
 I'd ask you to call and inform planet Earth I'm coming back 
 To stack astronomic fees as a music producer 
 And you? You're stuck at zero G's, Medusa 
 "God is Dead... Space" 
 Thus Spake Zarathustra
