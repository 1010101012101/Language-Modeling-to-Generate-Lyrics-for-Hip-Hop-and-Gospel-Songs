(Dead Man Walkn) 
 Hop in the Titan with the aim of stopping them strikin' 
 I'm not going to lie; it'll probably get properly violent 
 You should eat your greens because you're lackin' in iron, man 
 I don't mean to talk beanstalks but I'm jackin' your giant 
 I've seen gore beyond belief, war machines torn up like magazines 
 Fragged to smithereens with C4, rock you like a see-saw 
 Rucking's what I breath for, drop you into free fall 
 And pop you when you respawn, free runnin' and free gunnin' 
 Among the debris, becoming elite, keep runnin' your mouth 
 I'll separate your gum and your teeth, I find it funny you keep 
 Comin' back for more, like Oliver Twist did 
 When he risked it, 'cause he really wanted something to eat 
 Are you big enough? 
 Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me? 
 Reckon you're big enough? 
 Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me? 
 You're talkin' all that while I'm ignorin', walkin' tall 
 While I'm takin' great strides, you were barely taught to crawl 
 I'm a fighter personified, warts and all 
 You've never fought a war in all your life 
 Why, we all can brawl, you've not got the balls 
 To drop and fall, hop from wall to wall 
 Adrenaline is setting in, a veritable smorgasbord 
 Of fluids runnin' through you like a sewer or a waterfall 
 You're short of all the gall you need and so you're sure to fall 
 Check my vortex blocker, it could more or less stop a chopper 
 While I take a break to make a mocha, make a mockery of you 
 You can't refuse, I made an offer 
 Leave you shakin', quakin', mate, you need to take your beta blockers 
 Are you big enough? 
 Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me? 
 Reckon you're big enough? 
 Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me? 
 Yeah, I think you're rather justified, In feelin' mugged off 
 Every attack you tactically attacked with, Atlas Shrugged off 
 So spray me with de-Ogre-ant, that stuff just rubs off 
 I stride up in my Stryder and tear your lugs off 
 My smart pistol is rippin' and pullin' apart gristle 
 Leave a dark ripple in your chest, you need kevlar nipples 
 I blast missiles at trolls for laughs, giggles and lulz 
 So I wouldn't advise gettin' involved, if you're not MLG 
 MGL, A shower of empty shells as everyone around me's 
 Shredded into bits and sent to hell 
 No one's ever started somethin' with me, that ever ended well 
 Whatever pilot or Titan tried it, in the end they fell 
 Are you big enough? 
 Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me? 
 Reckon you're big enough? 
 Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me? 
 Are you big enough? 
 Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me? 
 Reckon you're big enough? 
 Come and have a go, I'll knock you off your feet
