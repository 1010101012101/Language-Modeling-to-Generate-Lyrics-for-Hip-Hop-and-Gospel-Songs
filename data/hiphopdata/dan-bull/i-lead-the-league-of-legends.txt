Hey ho! 
 Let me take over and amaze those couch potatoes 
 As I slay foes who stray close to my caseload of great flows 
 Every moment I make goes straight to the Summoner showcase 
 Most played so they know me as the Great Bull 
 You're a scapegoat 
 Your opinion's nothing to me 
 I'm running Dominion 
 Buffin' my speed 
 And some of the Summoners comin' at me 
 Are just gonna be meat to increase my sum of XP 
 I'm brilliant killin' a million minions a minute until 
 I've diminished your kingdom 
 You're finished 
 You're fish fillets 
 Your tower is under attack 
 I'm the Tienanmen Square man 
 You're vanishing under my tank 
 My champions dismantlin' your Pantheon and gankin' 'em 
 He's leavin' them bleedin' and needin' immediate 
 Treatment from an ambulance 
 And when it comes to spells 
 I'm bettin' you can't even spell "Chrysanthemums" 
 I lead the League of Legends 
 You idiots need protection 
 My collection increases weekly 
 Till I reach perfection 
 I lead the League of Legends 
 You idiots need protection 
 My collection increases weekly 
 Till I reach perfection 
 I fire fireballs 
 At the Riot Store 
 Champions? I try 'em all 
 And level them up into higher forms 
 Till my enemies look at the eye of the storm 
 I'm takin' aim and rainin' pain again, again you're slain 
 To explain my brain's a strain 
 But it's safe to say I remain insane 
 I lay in wait beneath the shrubberies and jungle leaves 
 Comin' from the trees to plunder everythin' but your dungarees 
 My hunger needs feedin' 
 I feast on feeble underlings 
 And leave them wondering whether it's thunder or my tummy rumbling 
 And now I'm within your perimeter 
 Administerin' your distributor 
 With a particularly vicious and pitiless kick in the 
 Knickers until it gives in to testicular sickness 
 My method's meticulous 
 This record's ridiculous 
 I'm a carnivorous sinister villainous killer 
 You're just a little wuss 
 I lead the League of Legends 
 You idiots need protection 
 My collection increases weekly 
 Till I reach perfection 
 I lead the League of Legends 
 You idiots need protection 
 My collection increases weekly 
 Till I reach perfection 
 I'm brutal 
 I lack scruples 
 So any defence is actually futile 
 I'll never attend a tribunal 
 Till everythin' ends and it's my funeral 
 I've got rooms full of Runes 
 It's not just hot tunes I produce 
 With lots of vitality, clarity, avarice, malice, alacrity 
 It's a laugh to see you after me and my masteries 
 What's that you tryin' to cast at me? 
 I'm cleansin' anythin' men have attempted to send in my path you see? 
 These legendary staffs and blades 
 Will send a competitor back to base 
 My most regular WAV that's played? 
 "An enemy has been slain"
