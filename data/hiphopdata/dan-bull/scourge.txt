Ramiro Cortez, A hero caught in the middle of an era of war 
 Or a dark assassin with a darker past 
 Who will start to blast before you're part of the action 
 Try to match your reaction to him 
 Don't make me laugh, you'll be trash in the bin 
 How are you going to handle a man 
 With the stamina to run from the west of Alaska through Canada? 
 Who's up next? Let's flip the damn switch 
 Click, and it's Victor Dantrix 
 Using military skill to his advantage 
 Putting a finish to your tricks and antics 
 You're in a bit of a pickle, fix a sandwich 
 As I rap so fast it's a different language 
 Vocals roaming the globe when I say 
 That Stonewall's only a phone call away, so when 
 There's an outbreak, a scourge, get your weapon drawn 
 It's not a metaphor, better call Echo Squad 
 There's an outbreak, a scourge, get your weapon drawn 
 It's not a metaphor, better call Echo Squad 
 Mass James Lang, ex-SAS 
 If he asks for a hand then you best say yes 
 Scotland is the land that he's from 
 And as a result he can toss you with one hand 
 I'm referring to cabers, not glands 
 The only thing he's wacking off is a shotgun 
 Solid as a rock man with a dangerous secret 
 So you better pray that he keeps it 
 Tarn's not the NSA 
 But if you leak it your face'll need a re-fit 
 Slapping you, smack in the face so hard 
 That the glass of your mask it'd crack and then shatter 
 And make those shards the slow-mo part of the trailer 
 Your brain's going to know by heart 
 Don't try this at home in a scuffle 
 You'll damage the bone in your knuckle 
 She's a Russian-American emigrant 
 Burnt by chemicals, the depression is evident 
 Mind messed up like the pallor of her melanin 
 Never mind feminine, never mind heroine 
 Her enemies better be clever whenever they get her 
 'Cause she'll end the five six, seven, eight, nine, ten of them 
 You'll have to find another set of hired guys 
 With the Firefly, it's like "bye bye" 
 There's an outbreak, a scourge, get your weapon drawn 
 It's not a metaphor, better call Echo Squad 
 There's an outbreak, a scourge, get your weapon drawn 
 It's not a metaphor, better call Echo Squad 
 Failure is not an option
