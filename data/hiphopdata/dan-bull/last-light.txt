Miracle of Sound 
 Do you know the meaning of fear 
 When you fear to lose all that you hold dear? 
 Do you know the feeling of being alone 
 On your knees in the rubble of your home?

 They said that Moscow was a lost hope but it's not though 
 It's just gone off the beaten track to meet a crossroad 
 Glossed over its past, crossed over at last 
 You know it had to drop the sickle and hammer to wield a crossbow 
 Claustrophobic moments frozen, suppose the cock crows and 
 They hoped that after the blast there'd be just cockroaches 
 When mutants prove a nuisance, you sense there's a uselessness 
 To jurisprudence so surely you need new solutions 
 Not just purely for amusement, you can do things to improve things 
 Become a student of their blueprints or just shoot them 
 Stab them, grab them, chop them, whatever option stops them 
 Blood on my hands and I've not got a moment to wash them 
 I'm going to aim lower and throw in the flamethrower 
 You know I'm insane, so I just throw a grenade, blow up 
 So much pain that I could throw up, flat on my back 
 And I still twat an attacker that's at my heels, for real

 Trying to stop us is like trying to stop a moving freight train 
 To protect our families, we are prepared to shoot and take pain 
 We stay awake through days and days, ensure our group can stay safe 
 We'll take the aches and pains and trade 'em for grenades and AKs 
 They say life is sacred, I say I can take it 
 In moments like this it's our soul the light hits shining naked 
 They say life is sacred, I say I can take it 
 Pull the pin from my grenade and bake it while I wait to die degraded
