Dan Bull 
 Smith, Stiffy, Skitch, McTwist into 
 A kickflip, liptrick, quick switcheroo 
 You kids get pissed if we missed a few 
 But we got a frickin' big list of tricks to do 
 I'm like giving a nuke to Mr Magoo 
 Hit the big red button 
 Head buttin' 
 If you dispute 
 The only way I'll open my eyes to different views 
 Is when I'm ownin' the skies 
 360 degrees 
 Skatopia bred 
 Straight over your head 
 I can't skate so I play it from my sofa instead 
 While you're wearin' your Ray-bans 
 And getting a spray-tan 
 The British are rippin' up the American Wasteland 
 Dave and Dan are bringin' the skill 
 Singin' at will 
 I'd give my kingdom for a horse call me king of the hill 
 Rap's Richard the Third 
 Gap tricking with words 
 Ha 
 Bringing a flamingo 
 That isn't a bird 
 Smack 
 Hittin' the curb like my back wheel 
 But this isn't the certain Thug Life 2Pac feels 
 You won't be having your cap peeled 
 But I might crack a melon, acapella 
 And prepare your last meal 
 A bit of stalefish 
 You're not gettin' bailed, prick 
 So get on your bike 
 Lest you get your little tail-whipped 
 You failed to nail the trick 
 You've been derailed 
 And made to pale into insignificance 
 You silly little 
 I'm a Tony Hawk addict and I 
 Jump on my board, grab it and fly 
 Fly, fly, fly, fly 
 I'm a Tony Hawk addict and I 
 Jump on my board, grab it and fly 
 Fly, fly, fly, fly 
 Dave Brown 
 First of all 
 I'd like to assure I'm all above board 
 But as gravity attests I tend to break laws 
 That's legality suppressed 
 When I space walk 
 So I'm always entertained, I'll never skate bored 
 Half work, half play 
 That 50/50 grind 
 But there's two games at stake 
 And that's the rap and the skate kind 
 When I hear a hater say that it's only a game 
 "Revert to manually skating" 
 What am I a cave man? 
 No way fam! 
 So don't give me that lip, trick 
 When I flip out, jump up and grab you you'll zip quick 
 I'll hit with a triple kickflip you over 
 So there's a high chance of a spine transfer 
 While I band this sick mix 
 I got them RSI rhymes 
 And if you disagree I'll be like 
 "No, comply" 
 While grindin' pipes for sure brought nostalgia 
 IF one more man misunderstands when I say 
 Tony Hawks Underground look 
 Smack that hipster 
 And break his indie nosebone 
 Hit him so hard, I'll press his X chromosome 
 Then get air so high I'll bring back a boatload of ozone 
 And tell him what I told Newton 
 Just give up and go home!
