Sarah Kerrigan 
 Used to be the Queen of Blades but she has changed 
 Or maybe deep beneath the surface she's the same as in the previous game 
 The Zerg have been and came, they yearn for these terrains 
 Observe the teaser trailer, deep relationships are complicated 
 E.g. Sarah's thing with Raynor 
 See, she doesn't know what makes sense 
 She loves him as much as she hates Mengsk 
 But James has a sense that her craving for vengeance 
 Has sent her to take some great lengths 
 It'll take strength to face, so I suggest you defend your base 
 'Cause if Sarah Kerrigan is never getting better then 
 The Terrans evidently better get together 
 And prepare a method of repelling her 
 I'm telling you, any and every hellion 
 Better be levelling and getting heavier 
 Nefarious, tell Valerian his dad's life expectancy 
 Is desperately precarious and he'd better be aware of this 
 Once you've been the killer queen 
 The Wings of Liberty are nothing 
 But a means to give your enemies some misery 
 Once you've been the killer queen 
 The Wings of Liberty are nothing 
 But a means to give your enemies some misery
