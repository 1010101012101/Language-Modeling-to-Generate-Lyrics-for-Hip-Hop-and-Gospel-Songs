Hey, I'm the Silver Surfer 
 And this is the, uh, the, the, the, the intermission 
 This is the part where we take a break from the music 
 And just chill a little bit, just, just, just, just relax 
 You know, come, come, come to terms with the fact 
 That we're listening to the greatest album of all time 
 And, and, and we do need a little breather occasionally 
 Absorb all that brilliance that's, that, that's soaked into us 
 Like bleach into a sponge that's been dropped into a sink 
 In need of cleaning for a long, long time 
 Anyway, that's the intermission over
