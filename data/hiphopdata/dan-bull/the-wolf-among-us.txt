(Look, this is Fabletown) 
 The place where fables are found 
 Grimy roads replace the yellow bricks paved on the ground 
 (How many of them stay here?) 
 I'm unable to count 
 Because labelled as outcasts they stay underground 
 (They keep themselves to themselves) 
 Invisible among these mundies 
 (They use a spell to repel) 
 Every community needs a way to keep in order 
 (Someone to police the place) 
 A sort of senior lawman 
 Formerly the Big Bad Wolf, they call him Bigby 
 (Went from eating kids to drinking neat whisky) 
 When lying alone at night, I don't quite know why 
 He's got the hots for Snow White 
 (I know, right?) 
 All it took to hook him long ago was a lone bite 
 It was so wrong 
 (Yet so right) 
 In Fabletown they face a daily struggle 
 To escape the place they came from and the range of ways 
 That they can raise up trouble 
 (Dark forces want to see this place razed to rubble) 
 (But Bigby's a razor blade, erasing any trace of stubble) 
 Perhaps one too many close shaves, check the mirror 
 See things a little clearer, the answer's getting nearer 
 He needs to keep his fellow fables out of harm's way 
 Be they in Bullfinch Street or at the farm, hey 
 Stop crying over spilt milk 
 (Pick up the dairy pail) 
 And dig up the truth that's hidden underneath this fairy tale 
 You better beware, for there's a wolf among us 
 But the truth is the food for which he hungers 
 You better beware, for there's a wolf among us 
 But the truth is the food for which he hungers 
 You better beware, for there's a wolf among us 
 But the truth is the food for which he hungers 
 (Beware) 
 (Beware for there's A Wolf Among Us)
