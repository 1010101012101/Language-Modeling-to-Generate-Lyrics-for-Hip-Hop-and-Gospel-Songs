I'm stranded in space, so I place my hands on my face 
 Did you guess, this isn't a situation I can handle with grace? 
 Nevertheless, Dan's on the case and I never pander to tastes 
 In case they change like the range of animals and plants in this place 
 I've visited all different corners of the Galaxy 
 There isn't any flora and fauna that I haven't seen 
 I'm interplanetary, always in thrall of the random scenes 
 Tangerines, dreams, you'll never see such things 
 In your National Geographic magazine 
 Grab a bit of cobblestone, carry it and hobble home 
 Boulders on my shoulders and I'm sorry for my collarbone 
 But I've got to build a model home, I don't want it to be monochrome 
 Colours light my life when I'm on my own 
 If I can't craft with it, I don't want to know 
 I don't want to, no, oh, what a homophone 
 Starbound son, beam me down 
 I am a Starbound son, leave me now 
 Starbound son, beam me down 
 I am a Starbound son, leave me now 
 I'm a hip hopper, got a disk in my shiplocker 
 Might be fly, swap a wing for a pig trotter 
 Tick tock, plot thickening to get hotter 
 Planet calling Daniel, I think I need an ink blotter 
 You're full of gas like a Novakid 
 Aww, did I make you sad? Well I hope I did 
 I'm cooking up a plan and I'm about to blow the lid 
 Although there's nothing in the pan so don't open it 
 So hungry, so hungry, I'm in a hurry to put something in my tummy 
 So hungry, I'm so hungry, I'm in a hurry to put something in my tummy 
 Yummy, Brineapple pie, Neonmelon and a Pineapple 
 Pine for a Coralcreep, curry, curry 
 I'm so hungry, I'm in a hurry to put something in my tummy 
 Starbound son, beam me down 
 I am a Starbound son, leave me now 
 Starbound son, beam me down 
 I am a Starbound son, leave me now 
 I need to explore, I've got an aching feeling, the call 
 The Universe is waiting, this is a race for the mineral and ore 
 Love the thrill of the chase so I'm winning in the war 
 Love Dreadwing Penguin, I pin him to the floor 
 With a minimum of effort then I'm ready for some more 
 I need to explore, I've got an aching feeling, the call 
 The Universe is waiting, every Galaxy is a snowflake 
 Floating in the sky like an island, no fake 
 This is a fact; it's actual, zoom in and in and in 
 And interact with the fractal, every snowflake is a Galaxy 
 Floating in the sky like an eye looking back at me 
 This is a fact; it's actual, zoom in and in and in 
 And interact with the fractal 
 Starbound son, beam me down 
 I am a Starbound son, leave me now 
 Starbound son, beam me down 
 I am a Starbound son, leave me now
