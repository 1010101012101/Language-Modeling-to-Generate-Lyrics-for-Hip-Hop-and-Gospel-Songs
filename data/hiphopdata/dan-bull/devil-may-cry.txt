Devil May Cry, never say die, end any enemy whenever they try 
 Body count rising every time, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
 My character balances devil and dalliance 
 They should give me a medal for arrogance 
 'Cause I believe that either Ivory or Ebony 
 Can annihilate at a higher rate than any enemy cannon 
 And I'm an adolescent Nephilim, packing weapons and stepping in 
 I'm in my element, a bit of rebellion's good for development 
 I came as an angel, left as a devil 
 I'm raping the layers of hell, every level 
 Bellview Pier Resident, a nuclear weapon 
 Live on red alert, so never press, do you hear, President? 
 I guess you learnt the hard way not to dance with Dante 
 Partake in a date with me, I'll leave you with a heartache, heart rate: 
 Irregular beating like a hard break, heartbreak 
 Your bars are archaic, I'd pray you never parley with me 
 For God's sake I can't take it 
 I live in the middle of Limbo City, broken windows, it's so pretty 
 Life of grime, shit's so gritty, got to kill time so I writ this ditty 
 Devil May Cry, never say die, end any enemy whenever they try 
 Body count rising every time, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
 I'm the Sword of the Order that all of the forces are falling for 
 Psycho borderline, I'm sure that I was born with enormous balls 
 I got them from my father 'cause I'm a son of Sparda 
 My God, my tongue is sharper than katanas in the barber's 
 You're the bluntest in the genre, should have done it harder 
 Now the best you're going to get is to become a martyr 
 Barbas is a lardass, couldn't spar fast with a hardass 
 I'll smack his chops leave him looking like a car crash 
 Black and blue, I rap to bruise Raptor news 
 Blast your propaganda back to you 
 Get Kat to tag the facts across your camera view 
 Man, my music's maxed out, so what's a chap to do? 
 Come back for the next track, you'll find out after Chapter II 
 Thanking you, good afternoon, good afternoon, good afternoon 
 Devil May Cry, never say die, end any enemy whenever they try 
 Body count rising every time, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
