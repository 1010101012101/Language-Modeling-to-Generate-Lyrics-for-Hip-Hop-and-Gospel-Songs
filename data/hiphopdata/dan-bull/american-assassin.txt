An eagle soars as the people fall 
 However, he ignores all your feeble wars 
 He will steal a horse, speed the steed across 
 Clean between your forces and beat them all 
 In a free-for-all, these scenes of gore 
 Are nothing but another bit of heathen lore 
 From Florentine streets to Venetian waters 
 The whispers persist of a secret order 
 And whether or not you believe, it's all good 
 Either way I'll proceed; keep wreaking trauma 
 You're never making Connor fall, I never honour laws 
 When I'm on a warpath my tomahawk's 
 Always responsible for an onslaught 
 Of monstrous proportions, you're a goner, fool 
 Done for, humans I hunt for 
 Dropping through the roof never knocking on the front door 
 What, you want more or do you want war? 
 I've been around for longer than Rob Faulkner 
 And now I'm gonna run up on a futhamucking armed gunner 
 Pull a Stone Cold Stunner and I've done a runner 
 Quicker than a bullet from a gun and once again I'm under cover 
 Repping for the Brotherhood, stepping like no other could 
 Uppercutting any threats I never take another look 
 I'm an assassin one with a passion for innovative rapping 
 Dropping so fast you're probably having a problem to follow the captions 
 Said I'm an assassin one with a passion for innovative rapping

 I combat colonialism while owning a rhythm 
 I know the world doesn't owe me a living 
 So throw me a bone and I'll cause pandemonium with it 
 Ignoring Newtonian physics 
 Forget opprobrium, critics'll go with baloney below 
 To the same place I take fakes 
 Phoneys and mimics, no need for gimmicks 
 Cynics only need a mo' with my lyrics 
 Do you need me to explain that I'm lyrically spraying it 
 Sharper than the tip of any bayonet 
 I pack a hidden blade and I make you lay on it 
 Whether minutemen or redcoats 
 It'll only take a minute at the very most 
 Till they're both dead, ghosts 
 I dead both behead foes till stocks and shares in lead rose 
 From Boston to New York, soul of an eagle 
 Aloft in a true hawk and as I move through the frontier 
 The truth becomes clear the future calls, I'm done here 
 Almost, I've just got another little task 
 And I won't tell if you don't ask, because 
 I'm an assassin one with a passion for innovative rapping 
 Dropping so fast you're probably having a problem to follow the captions 
 Said I'm an assassin one with a passion for innovative rapping
