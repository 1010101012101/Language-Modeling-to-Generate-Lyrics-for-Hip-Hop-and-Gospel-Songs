My name's Kaitlin 
 I've been away since this time last year, ages and ages 
 I've been abroad, it's been a long road 
 But I'm getting bored so I've got aboard and gone home 
 Get through the door, I don't really know 
 Where anybody is as if there's nobody home 
 Hopefully though, I'll find a clue 
 It better be a joke they're tryin' to do 
 I've gone home and I'm on my own 
 I've gone home and I'm all alone 
 I've been around everywhere, nothing found yet 
 I've looked outside, I've looked downstairs 
 I've looked upstairs, tell me now where? 
 I'm well scared, this is getting pretty out there 
 Where's Mom and Dad? Where's Samantha? 
 Somewhere in the mansion there's an answer 
 Have they left? Are they dead from cancer? 
 Kidnapped by the Feds or gangsters? 
 I'm wracked with a sense of dread 
 So deep I could believe it was a necromancer 
 There's an atmosphere that's noxious 
 Something bleak and evil watches 
 But there's nothing here but sheets and boxes 
 Nobody's holdin' people hostage 
 I just need the key to reveal each secret 
 Like a seasoned locksmith 
 I've gone home and I'm on my own 
 I've gone home and I'm all alone 
 I've gone home and I'm on my own 
 I've gone home and I'm all alone 
 I'm losing my mind in a psycho house 
 So I pray no lights go out 
 It's just me; my lone self 
 No family, no life, no sound 
 No clues so I know nought 
 And I'm bloody terrified on my own, help 
 All I have is letters and scraps 
 No weapons except for this map 
 I'm desperate for something better than that 
 If I have any chance to defend from attacks 
 Now there is a hatch to enter the attic 
 It's a place that I've left to the last bit 
 Now I've got the key, I'm prepared to get past it 
 I need to know either way whether it's tragic 
 Or whether my head has gone mad 
 And so I hold on to my breath and then grab it 
 I've gone home and I'm on my own 
 I've gone home and I'm all alone 
 I've gone home and I'm on my own 
 I've gone home and I'm all alone
