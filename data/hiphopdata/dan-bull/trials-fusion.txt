Dan Bull's back in the saddle, ooh yeah 
 I'm sitting on the saddle of my motorcycle 
 Kicking up the gravel that'll poke your eyeball 
 Making roads though only sidewards 
 Go to the right till I pwn my rivals 
 My bike can fly, I'm rising skyward 
 You wouldn't like to try this but I would 
 Go higher, no wires till my bones are broke like plywood 
 Two wheels and a health care policy 
 When I ride, there's a health scare, honestly 
 With the hospital costs that I've got 
 Every third world debt could be dropped and forgot 
 Look chum, between me and you, there must be an easier route 
 But if I took a bus for an easy commute 
 Then I wouldn't see the scenery too 
 My team is a beaut, fifty nifty people who 
 Who can easily do maneuvers 
 That need to be seen to believe to be true 
 We'll leave it to you to see a futuristic mystic misfit 
 Do the sickest flip trick in the district 
 Till I break stuff like the dude that's in Limp Bizkit 
 You're too simplistic to risk it 
 You could sit and sift through statistics 
 And never see another human who's sadistic 
 Masochistic through ballistics 
 Kick in the ignition till my boots are twisted 
 True peristence and brutal quickness 
 Rips through resistance of stupid nitwits 
 It's a twist of the wrist and the gears are shifted 
 Give me a kiss, oops, I smeared your lipstick 
 Clearly gifted, considerably 
 We're here to get lifted, literally 
 If you're in my vision even peripherally 
 I'll rip you to little pieces deliberately 
 Plenty more fish in the sea, I'm throwing nets out 
 Picking a team, only the best, wow 
 Collectively we're going to leave you stressed out 
 Till evidently you gonna need a rest, pow 
 I apologise for my intrusion 
 But I want to fight with Isaac Newton 
 When I ride my bike disproving his life's delusion 
 I'd confuse him, sir, gravity is a trite illusion 
 That tries reducing my skyward movement 
 But my conclusion is I'm going to fly 
 It's Trials Fusion 
 I float through the air like a cloud 
 Shaped like a motorbike 
 And made from pieces of a motorbike 
 Indistinguishable, in fact, from an actual motorbike 
 With me on it, flying like a cloud 
 That's shaped like a motorbike
