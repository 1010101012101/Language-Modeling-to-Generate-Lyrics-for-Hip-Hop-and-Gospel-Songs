When gamers came along, the planet laughed at us 
 But this is gaming in the future and you haven't heard the last of us 
 Dismissing this is just an enormous fallacy 
 So open your mind, and let it alter your reality 
 Hey geeks, I bring a message from the future 
 There's a new revolution heading to computers 
 It's '73, but it won't be too long 
 Till we can get the TV to play a game of Pong 
 But it's time to breakout of the house 
 The crazy days of Space Invaders await us 
 Arcade potatoes, swap the shooting range 
 For computer games, arcade renaissance 
 Pre-8-bit's blooming days 
 A new decade, welcome to the 80's 
 Pac-Man's the latest new craze, Q*Bert's the rage 
 The first personal computers let loose 
 As Manic Miner grabs your time, and to fight is truly useless 
 Elite gave legions of wee little boys 
 A deep space region and freedom of choice 
 Now here comes the console 
 The first one sold portended an industry of dimensions untold 
 The birth of franchise, Mario Brothers 
 Donkey Kong, Monty Mole, I'd tell you the others 
 But, the list would go on and on longer than I can tell 
 Until the 90's when the game became handheld 
 Meanwhile, I bought stories of another time 
 And point-and-click arrived from the shores of Monkey Island 
 Ever want to see your chums beat right up? 
 Well, Daniel-san, you need to try Street Fighter 
 A tournament with all your buddies in your front room 
 Is all good until you fight online on Doom 
 Hijack your mind, your momma can't abide this 
 Night Trap might lack morals, it's a moral crisis 
 What are we doing to our youth? They're shooting people 
 Glued to screens with superglue 
 Computers need to be banned when the laws broke 
 Ban Manhunt, ban Grand Theft Auto 
 Try something musical, but if you have a sore throat 
 I have what you're after, Parappa the Rapper 
 Tomb Raider, the tune invades your brain 
 Get in her way and she'll make you taste the pain 
 A sports a game always and it's hard fact 
 Then a game became a sport and its name was Starcraft 
 Kids used to play with dolls and a house 
 The Sims is the same, but controlled with a mouse 
 Open worlds abound, but rarely 3D, hey 
 Until the Elder Scrolls and GTA 
 Wait till you see the scale of the monsters and bosses 
 That you face in Shadow of the Colossus 
 Things are getting bigger, more decisions, more maps 
 Millions of simultaneous players in Warcraft 
 All the people, so many people 
 See, your whole family can get involved in Wii Sports 
 And more people means more money, more flair 
 For big blockbusters, COD: Modern Warfare 
 Even more people, more freedom, more indie games 
 Limbo, Fez, Super Meat Boy, Braid 
 Revolutionizing gameplay, a mind blast 
 Constructing infinite destructible worlds, Minecraft 
 Gaming on the telephone, yes I know it sounds absurd 
 Fruit Ninja, Farmville, Angry Birds

 Gamers, the world is ours 
 Now, where shall we take it?
