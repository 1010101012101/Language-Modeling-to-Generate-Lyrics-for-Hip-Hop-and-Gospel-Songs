Listen up, brother, got a little rhyme for you 
 But I gotta tell ya; I ain't no durn singer 
 I'm a gunslinger 
 Who's a better gunslinger? That's a humdinger 
 Blood blister on my one finger from triggers 
 And I don't hunt deer, so chump, here's something I'd like to advise 
 Better run for your life if you'd like to survive in the frontier 
 It's like you drunk beer, brain ain't configured 
 A word to the wise and your mind will become clear 
 Bright as the lights on the rides of a fun fair 
 So come bring your Jesse James and Billy the Kid 
 I'll make a mess of their brains and fill 'em with lead 
 And I will until every damn villain is dead 
 Then I'm bringin' the sheriff a bag full of their heads 
 Handlin' any man that is plannin' to stand in my path 
 Because I'm heavy-handed with every bandit I wrangle with 
 And we're in a century that hasn't any ambulances 
 So best pack your best brandy and bandages 
 When I'm rat-a-tat-tattin' on my Gatling guns 
 The blast attacks faster than my battlin' puns 
 A LeMat in my one hand and another in my other 
 So get runnin' for cover, you would you rather be buggered? 
 Shots, I'm lickin' off like the sugar on my cherry strudel 
 I'm quick on the draw, call me Mary Doodles 
 I'm gettin' reward money to bury people 
 And as a result, I never need to be very frugal 
 'Less you want your tooth pulled, pay the dentist 
 I make rackets as if it's an angry game of tennis 
 Don't hate the player, no, hate the business 
 I make a livin' from wanted posters: Jay McGuiness 
 Forget a hook, I ain't no durn singer 
 Brother, look, I'm just a gunslinger 
 So forget a hook, I ain't no durn singer 
 Brother, look 
 I'm just gonna get some dynamite and then I'll light my pipe 
 And when the timing's right, I'll set the skies alight 
 Kind of like Juarez calls for Silas Greaves 
 To make you fall like a pile of leaves 
 Shootin' line after line after line of thieves 
 And I've touched more gold than a miner's sleeves 
 When I wield dual revolvers, you'll feel the coldness 
 Once in a blue moon, I'm using my holsters 
 Shootin' my Colt, I'm too skilled to falter 
 Is it any wonder saloons here are closed? 
 When you bring a whole platoon filled with soldiers 
 I barbecue fools, a new meal for vultures 
 High noon, we're overdue for elevenses 
 I left the saloon, it was strewn with your severed limbs 
 Bringin' just a shoe to a shootout 
 To kick your booty so brutally, you'll never get my boot out 
 Forget a hook, I ain't no durn singer 
 Brother, look, I'm just a gunslinger 
 So forget a hook, I ain't no durn singer 
 Brother, look, I'm just a gunslinger 
 I'm just a mean-ass gunslinger 
 And I guess that's all I'll ever be 
 But lemme tell you that's all I ever wanna be 
 A mean-ass gunslinger, pardner 
 Beg your pardon, ma'am
