(Dead Man Walkn) 
 I'm driving a titan without a licence 
 These mean beasts begin at like five tons 
 It's a cypher like no other, tough mudder got you frightened 
 You're no object, though you claim you're heavyweight like Tyson 
 Nah, sure, now let me change your mind 
 Bye son, go away, Because I say so, 'kay ho? 
 And stay in focus or you'll face a plague of locusts 
 Crusading over your terrain till you're run over 
 The rain is soaking us making progress slow as a tortoise 
 Time to revise on what our training courses taught us 
 You're in dangerous waters so call a priest, it's actually urgent 
 Observe a pattern emerging and learn the lesson Kaiser 
 Franz Ferdinand didn't learn 
 I'm a hellcat, a mashup of a panther 
 And Samuel L Jackson in shaft with a birch gun 
 I'm the real deal though, not just a nice actor 
 Typecast to plough up the ground like tractors 
 Tanks are big, big are tanks 
 Would you like a normal sized car? 
 No thanks 
 I'm a tiger you're a mouse, all up in my grill 
 So if you don't want to be killed then you best get out 
 I drive a Wespe, you ride a Vespa 
 When I tell you to be my valentine, you reply, "Yes sir!" 
 I bet that you can't even invent a pun for Hetzer 
 Well nor can but I don't care 'cause I am still the best at 
 World of Tanks and it's a fact, I'm absolutely sure, man 
 Whether you're a yank, Jap, Chinese, frog, Russian or German 
 I'm Churchill meets Cromwell with a dash of Wolverine 
 Smash and pulverise you into smithereens jauntily 
 Chin up, keep a cheery demeanour, follow the covenant 
 I am a leopard, you're a cheetah without the cunning 
 I'mma hum a lullaby, put out your lights, you're out of luck, son 
 You're an alpha prototype, I am the GOTY, uh uh! 
 I got more ram too, use it to ram you 
 You dick, I maxed out what my contraption can do 
 You're Stuart Little, I'm bigger, I'm better, I'm harder too 
 You're cruising for a bruising, sport, there's nothing your side can do 
 My team are bishops, yours are weedy vicars 
 I'm a combat cardinal conquering comet 
 Aw bless, you peed your knickers 
 Tanks are big, big are tanks 
 Would you like a normal sized car? 
 No thanks 
 Hey listeners, here's a fun idea 
 Why not rewind the song 
 And see if you can spot all fifty hidden tank names? 
 Ha ha, great
