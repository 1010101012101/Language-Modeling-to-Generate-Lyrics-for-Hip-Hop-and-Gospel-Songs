Who's rapping 
 Dovahkiin 
 Dragons? 
 I'm not over keen 
 I'll dice 'em like a knife 
 Slicin' right through an aubergine 
 My dragon shout flow 
 Is sweeter than a soda stream 
 You won't believe your eyes 
 I'm like an overload of dopamine 
 A broadsword in one hand 
 And a magic spell in the other 
 I'm the last of the Dragonborn 
 There's no other my brother 
 So run for cover 
 If you got scales 
 Then I'm on your tail 
 And I will not fail 
 Like a free-roaming 
 Sandbox game 
 I'm of the rails 
 I'll walk the trails 
 Through awful gales 
 And storms of hail 
 Till all the nails 
 Are knocked into your coffin 
 I'm not stoppin' 
 Till you're impaled 
 And I've prevailed 
 In the name of the Nords 
 I pray to the Lords 
 You'll all get a taste of the blade of my sword 
 I'm taking on hordes of enemies 
 I face them with hordes of weaponry 
 They're draining my force 
 So chemistry comes into play with retorts and recipes 
 Alchemixing like a DJ 
 Restoration restore my energy 
 My legacy 
 Odyssey, elegy, prophecy's- 
 Written in heavenly bodies 
 And buried with every body 
 That ever did bother to mess with me 
 Deadin' them terribly 
 Horribly 
 I'm a celebrity 
 Honestly 
 You're a wannabe 
 I'm a prodigy 
 The suggestion that you're better than me 
 At being a warrior? 
 Ha! 
 Comedy 
 It's a gift to me 
 I don't just spit flames lyrically 
 But literally 
 And the Elder Scrolls are scripts in which I've written your obituary 
 I am the Dragonborn 
 Wearing a hat with badass horns 
 I'm Dovahkiin 
 Known globally 
 You're nobody at all
