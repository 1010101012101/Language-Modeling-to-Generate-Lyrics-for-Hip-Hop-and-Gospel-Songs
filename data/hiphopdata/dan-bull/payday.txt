Newspapers strewn, warm bodies sprawling 
 Appalling, it'll be in the papers tomorrow morning 
 Along with mourning, the names of the fallen 
 Embodied in bold print for you to take as a warning 
 Never intervene with the American dream 
 We do whatever for the green, fill you with lead up in the streets 
 For that liquid cash, hot red liquid splash marks 
 Spattered on your dash then dash, brash 
 We bring the hustle back to sinew and muscle 
 Cracked bone, cracked glass, cracked windows in the tussle 
 Flash ringing from the muzzle till you're cinders in the rubble 
 I don't value pigs unless they're sniffing for the Truffles 
 I'm singing for the struggle, what you bringing to the scuffle? 
 I'm about to come and stick a pin into your bubble 
 Here's a cop killer for your trouble, blood spattered on the asphalt 
 But it doesn't matter, rat a tat tat, fuck a black mask 
 When death is entertainment then I'd better act daft 
 Like the Beatles on the rooftop 
 The police'll never let it be or get me to stop 
 You or me are going to soon drop 
 Down a staircase flight or fire escape 
 To a violent fate, fight or flight kick in right away 
 Rotate, but there's no turning back, you're going to roast 
 Flames are going to burn your back, murder rap 
 I'm sure you've heard of that, this is the real deal 
 No limit to who we'll do in and what we'll steal 
 And if you feel ill, then you can go away 
 This is the USA, if you can't take it you'll be thrown away 
 But if you don't back down you'll be blown away 
 Your wife'll tell your kids, "Daddy isn't coming home today" 
 Mayday, mayday, the situation's getting cray-cray 
 I'm Jesse James in his heyday, I'll face your grenades, melee weapons, AKs 
 Arrange the date of your funeral and the wake is my payday 
 They'll say that you were brave, pray 
 For the angels to change, the state's got to save face 
 I say grace, 'cause tonight you dine in paradise 
 While I take a plane, hijack a flight to Paraguay 
 I can't taste the prepackaged airline meal 
 And I can't say what the hell I feel 
 You made a dogs dinner on a dog day afternoon 
 I must be off, sorry but I'm going have to shoot 
 Said You made a dogs dinner on a dog day afternoon 
 I must be off, sorry but I'm going have to shoot 
 In God we trust 
 In God we trust
