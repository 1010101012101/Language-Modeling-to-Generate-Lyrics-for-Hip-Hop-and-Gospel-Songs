A distant district full of mystery, a kid with history 
 He lost his mother in the sea and thus he missed her deeply 
 What a disastrous event, he's not going to let it happen again 
 Whether dragons or men, he's battling them to protect his family 
 Prevent the tragedy happening again but the chances are stacking against it 
 His dad has collapsed, he's had an attack and that's going to test his friendship 
 With his brother, they grab the barrow and drag it 
 To one of the medicine men quick, the medic is hesitant 
 It's evident this will need better than lemsip 
 It's time for the siblings to set aside their quibblings 
 In favour of the big things and stride with all their might 
 Until they find the tree of life whose leaves provide a healing liquid 
 The quicker they fly, the quicker they might 
 Relieve their father's sickness

 The family bond will have to be strong if they're going to take calamity on 
 Collaborate, co-operate, co-ordinating, carrying on 
 Challenges, allergies, tragedies, maladies 
 Neither or either of them are a fan of these 
 No reprieve for a breather, it's anarchy 
 Don't know where we would be without family 
 These brothers need mothers like they need each other 
 One of them to man the oars, the other one to be the rudder 
 Whether covered in blood or mud, the blood runs deep 
 Deep as the allegiance these loved ones keep 
 It guards you while you sleep, holds back the darkness 
 Cold as a carcass with soul black and heartless 
 But there's something it can't touch and that's fraternity 
 Try as you might to break, it last for an eternity

 No, no, no, no, no, no 
 I'm lost without him, a moth without wings 
 It's like I lost a limb, my arms are crossed without him 
 Cross my heart, my heart is crushed without him 
 I'd cross the mountain tops 
 A thousand times again to bring him back but I can't 
 No matter just how much I'm shouting 
 I'm drowning, the current pulls me down 
 There's no one else so much as helping 
 What would my brother do? Haven't got a clue 
 But I feel a fire that burns in me and lifts me, it's fraternity 
 Try as you might to break it, it lasts for an eternity 
 Yes, there's something you can't crush and that's fraternity
