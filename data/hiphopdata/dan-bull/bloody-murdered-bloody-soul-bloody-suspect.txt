My name's Detective Ronan O'Connor 
 In my line of work, I'm facing death daily 
 But now it's me who's a goner 
 In Salem P.D. of all the homicides, Lord 
 I'd never say that it'd be me lying on the sidewalk 
 But whatever I thought, it's become irrelevant 
 My skeleton's regressing through the elements 
 And evidently, I'm undead till I seek and get the evidence 
 One foot in the grave has made me one step ahead of him 
 I'll make him taste his own medicine: the Bell Killer 
 Devout sinner, I doubt we're dealing with a swell fella 
 How did it happen? I need help with it 
 Throw the laws of physics out the window, go to town with it 
 I can walk through substances to suss out who the suspect is 
 But can't discuss or talk about the subject with them 'cause I must exist 
 I'm an ethereal, Pulp Noir serial star 
 But this is real despite appearing immaterial 
 I can't explain it, I'm on a hunt for the truth 
 To why my assailant made me plummet from under the roof 
 Salem is a place containing hundreds of clues 
 And my presumption is that somewhere in it somebody goofed 
 Woke up in a murder scene, a ghost interred in Purgatory 
 A dude determined to determine who has murdered me 
 Woke up in a murder scene, interred in Purgatory 
 A dude determined to determine who has murdered me 
 Murder scene, Purgatory 
 A dude determined to determine who has murdered me 
 How can I trust girls I find in the Dusk World? 
 It's dank musty musk must just blur lines 
 Slur words, disrupt and usurp minds 
 A corruption of the worst kind 
 But I need all the aid that I can find 
 Between mediums and demons, I will mainly have to pry 
 Maybe have to find, a shady patch and hide 
 From their crazy appetite, I'm not a tasty snack, am I? 
 I've already made the sacrifice of life 
 And the fact is I would like to not have to die twice 
 My mind keeps rewinding back to that night 
 The facts of what happened don't just stack up quite right 
 I can't explain it, I'm on a hunt for the truth 
 To why my assailant made me plummet from under the roof 
 Salem is a place containing hundreds of clues 
 And my presumption is that somewhere in it somebody goofed 
 Woke up in a murder scene, a ghost interred in Purgatory 
 A dude determined to determine who has murdered me 
 Woke up in a murder scene, interred in Purgatory 
 A dude determined to determine who has murdered me 
 Murder scene, Purgatory 
 A dude determined to determine who has murdered me 
 Whodunit? Who-a-whodunit? 
 Whodunit? Who-a-whodunit? 
 Whodunit? Who-a-whodunit? 
 Whodunit? Who-a-whodunit?
