Hello! 
 So, alot of people want to know what "MC" stands for 
 "Is it, uh, 'microphone controller'?" 
 Nope 
 "Is it 'Master of Ceremony'?" 
 Nope, certainly not 
 It's Minecraft! 
 And I am Dan Bull 
 I've got to admit 
 I rather like playing Minecraft 
 Even though the graphic style's 
 Older than an iron bath 
 Creative's great but on survival 
 I am crap 
 It's like the beginning of Oblivion 
 With the giant rats 
 Swingin' my fists around 
 And all I hit's the ground 
 This shit's tricky 
 And I'm not spittin' about the Bristol sound 
 Wish I could be whipping out 
 A pixelated pistol, pow! 
 Pigman down 
 Now let's hit the town 
 Before I got this game I promise you 
 I did go out 
 But I've given it up for bricks 
 I'm clinically addicted now 
 I need my fix 
 Or else I'll never leave my little house 
 Until I make it bigger 
 When my finger simply clicks the mouse 
 It fills me with a sensation of power 
 That's why I'm building me a sensational tower 
 To compensate for the shame 
 When I gaze down in the shower 
 I've played for hours 
 I need to wee, so later 
 I'll have to change my trousers 
 Just one more block 
 And I swear I'll stop (Swear I'll stop) 
 Just one more block 
 And I swear I'll stop (Shush) 
 Never mind beta blockers 
 I'm playing beta 
 And the blocks keep dropping 
 Like SEGA's stocks lately 
 Watch 
 I'm taking mobs down 
 Like a crazy cop 
 It'll take a hand amputation 
 To make me stop 
 Go figure 
 My axe and crafting table made me lots 
 Gold digger 
 Bigger than Kanye and Jamie Foxx 
 Behaving like an 80's b-boy 
 Breaking rocks 
 Remaking the Museum of Buildings 
 At Avoncroft 
 It's like a Lego set 
 With infinite bricks 
 And no chance of your vacuum cleaner 
 Pickin' up the bits 
 When I feel philosophical 
 I sit and look at it 
 And think I'd rather dig 
 Than touch Vanessa Hudgens' tits 
 It's like a game of Jenga 
 Without your friends beside 
 And there's a side 
 I'm quite eager to emphasize 
 Of course it's a geeky venture 
 Are you then surprised 
 Someone made a life-size model 
 Of the Enterprise? 
 I went and tried that myself 
 But I got bored quick 
 Although I still managed to replicate 
 The Borg ship 
 And all it took 
 Was one brick 
 And one click 
 I know what you're thinking 
 No need to say it 
 I'm sick 
 Just one more block 
 And I swear I'll stop 
 Just one more block 
 And I swear I'll stop 
 "You play Minecraft? 
 Oh my God 
 You're such a square" 
 "Yeah, I like Minecraft 
 It's positively delicious 
 Dan Bull 
 Do you dig? 
 I do"
