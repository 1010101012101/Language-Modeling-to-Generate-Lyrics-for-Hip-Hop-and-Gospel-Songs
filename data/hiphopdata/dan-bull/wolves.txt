Wolves, they're like dogs 
 But a bit different 'cause they're wild 
 And instead of barking, they say "ooh" 
 And that's the difference betwixt wolves and dogs 
 I'm sure there's more 
 But I ain't an expert in that sort 
 Of thing, so forgive me 
 If I'm factually wrong 
 This, uh, this song is more of a filler track 
 Than some of the others on the album, I will confess 
 Um, but you know, what can you expect from an eighteen track album? 
 Pure gold on all of them? 
 I suppose if it is "the best album in the world" that is what you would expect but, uh 
 Shut, shut up
