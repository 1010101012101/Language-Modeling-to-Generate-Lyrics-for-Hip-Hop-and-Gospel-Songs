I'm back in this habit 
 The tobacconist grabbing a packet of fags 
 And passing it back as I hand him the cash 
 The transaction is tragic 
 A moment of magic 
 As I open the packet and go for the wrapping 
 In only a moment I'll have this fag lit 
 The sad fact is I'm an addict, I need 
 The hit of nicotine, just to breathe 
 And it's obscene 
 Just between us, as a kid, I disbelieved 
 A brittle leaf mixed with heat 
 Could leave you feeling incomplete without it 
 So blow the smoke out quick 
 You'll feel terrible 
 However, you will have achieved something incredible 
 This is my last cigarette 
 I've done enough that I have to regret 
 This is my last cigarette 
 I've done enough that I have to regret 
 Bringing a whole different sting 
 To the thing you hold in your fingers 
 They're stained since you imitated 
 The behaviour of your favourite singer 
 I know you stroll to the cinema 
 And your role model's holding a Marlboro 
 The image is vivid and so you're sold the whole 
 Till your soul is a prisoner moulded in miniature 
 Rolled in a Rizla 
 Held in a wrestling hold till the finisher 
 You're choked out, so blow the smoke out 
 No doubt: self-control's what's killing you 
 This is my last cigarette 
 I've done enough that I have to regret 
 This is my last cigarette 
 I've done enough that I have to regret 
 This is my last cigarette 
 I've done enough I have to regret 
 Without gasping for breath, asking for death 
 In return for the active effects 
 As many a heroin addict has said 
 It's addictive as smack, you'd be daft to inject 
 Skip the needle and the needle skips 
 As I tap my fag, let the ash hit the deck 
 Stood on the back step in the rain 
 And never complain till my fag's wet 
 Splashed out, cashing the cheque 
 Ash, ground; ground, ash; have you met? 
 This is my last cigarette 
 I've done enough that I have to regret 
 This is my last cigarette 
 I've done enough that I have to regret 
 I stub the nub 
 Enough's enough, I'm good 
 I would gladly have another fag, see 
 But the fact is I'm done 
 It's off my chest 
 And I'm impressed 
 With my willpower, nothing less 
 Face my face at 88 miles an hour 
 Time travelling as my life expectancy expands 
 And I feel like a younger man 
 You need to fight the hunger, Dan 
 You're done; you can 
 I can 
 I am 
 This is my last cigarette 
 I've done enough I have to regret 
 This is my last cigarette 
 I've done enough I have to regret 
 This is my last cigarette 
 I've done enough I have to regret 
 This is my last cigarette 
 I've done enough that I have to regret
