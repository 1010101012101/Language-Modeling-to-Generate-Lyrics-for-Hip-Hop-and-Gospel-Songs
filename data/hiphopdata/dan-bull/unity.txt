An eagle soares as the streets all crawl with people 
 Stores and debris on the floor 
 We sweep up in awe at the cathedral walls 
 This city's laws are in need of rehaul 
 Freedom calls, soldiers amassing 
 And stacking their ammunition deep in the courts 
 Stand in a rank v. tattered banners and flags enacting a massacre 
 The assassins see this and leap from the walls 
 Unsure what the August Decrees did at all 
 Are you sure the Bastille couldn't fall? 
 We should rally morale and proceed with the war 
 Locks are chopped, the drawbridge drops 
 The raucus flock till they're reaching the courts 
 Ignoring the shots meat for the slaughter 
 Bleed on the floor just reeking of gore 
 Thanks a lot to the sans-culottes 
 For yanking off the breeches they wore 
 Breaching the walls and windows 
 Leap to the floor and the smokescreen it before 
 Defeating the bourgeoisie with a claw 
 I'm sure we've seen this before 
 Better catch and dispatch him or that 
 Matchstick'll blast this bastion to ashes 
 That sort of action's a burning mistake 
 Chat to my back 'cause I'm turning away 
 The earliest grave is the turn of your fate

 Alouette, je te plumerai

 Et la tête, et la tête 
 Je te plumerai la tête 
 The blade of the guillotine drops 
 I look at my watch then put it in my pocket and hurry 
 I've got to run in and stop my unlucky target succumbing to harm 
 And crumbling under the chopping block 
 While onlookers watch in numbness and shock 
 Back to the backstreets and the cobble 
 No palace these chaps dream of a hovel 
 Run around the action, gunpowder blasting 
 Push past the crowds and leap up a shop wall 
 Two hops and I'm on the rooftop 
 Move to a new spot and then I'll soon drop 
 Assess the scene eagle-eyed 
 Who needs to bleed, who needs to die? 
 You need to read between the lines 
 And move the bleating sheep aside 
 This is the reason why I made the decision to leave Versailles 
 Grim Reaper, unsheathe my scythe then cleave 
 Aand leave deprived of the need to breathe or even be alive, at least 
 You see, I need to find Elise 
 'Cause she gives me a reason to be a lease on life as we unite

 Alouette, je te plumerai 
 Je te plumerai la tête 
 Je te plumerai la tête 
 Et la tête, et la tête 
 Je te plumerai la tête
