I got your cards that you bought me; ignored them 
 Because I thought calling would cause me a boredom 
 And of course I'm ashamed to admit 
 That every birthday wished me further away 
 From your midst till I couldn't face taking the risk 
 I guess I lost my faith a little bit 
 But then I realised a fundamental basic 
 More than any other you encouraged me to be creative 
 So it might be quite belated 
 But I love you, Margaret and David

 You were with me in my first days 
 But then I shut myself away during my worst days 
 A half-baked reason why I'm worth cake 
 But now 11 star birthday is part of my wordplay 
 And you bought me a calligraphy set 
 I'm ashamed to say I haven't done calligraphy yet 
 I was a little perplexed and treated it with neglect 
 And yet now I make my living fiddling with text 
 Some of your gifts still bring back images 
 The little set of carved farmyard miniatures 
 The tree was my favourite piece 
 And it still is when I play with my niece 
 So yeah, I've done myself a favour at least 
 Now I'm back on the rails and I'm taming the beast 
 In a similar way to how my birthday cake did 
 It's time for you two to be celebrated 
 So it might be quite belated 
 But I love you, Margaret and David

 Was obviously 
 A hobby each of you wanted me to do 
 I never got into it properly 
 But now I love it, kind of like a kid with broccoli 
 My tastes took time to develop in the dark room 
 And now I can't do without it, honestly 
 You offered me an option 
 And I made you feel you'd been forgotten 
 Now the season's hot 
 And Evesham's lost some leaves and blossoms 
 But let's speak a little 
 Let's speak a little more often
