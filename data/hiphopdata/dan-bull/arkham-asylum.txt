Ha! So the Joker's locked away in the asylum 
 Methinks things are gonna become quite violent 
 I believe, he slipped a trick inside his sleeve 
 And his desire to leave is non-existent till he's 
 Played a game malicious hide and seek 
 With sticks and dynamite and TNT 
 But what's that silhouette that you can see? 
 In the half-light to the dark night 
 You might just find the Dark Knight 
 Savage as a shark bite 
 To the other rappers who can't just quite do this 
 You see the truth is 
 I leap from roofs with 
 A really ruthless steez 
 I leave you toothless please 
 You silly doofus 
 I'll give you a Chinese burn 
 And I don't mean Confucius 
 Dead inside a little urn 
 I'll twist your arm 
 Until the skin is rather irritated 
 My methods of torture are really unsophisticated 
 To the most complicated machinations 
 To mash your face in 
 With patterned lacerations that are fascinating 
 And as my grapple hangs my batarang'll batter gangs 
 I brang the thang to make you say this can't be happenstance 
 The blackest avalanche, and as Dan's an anagram of "and" 
 I'll crick your spine and leave twisted like an ampersand 
 Feeling squiffy like you're getting high in Amsterdam 
 The neon city light'll emphasize the fact your damned 
 Batman, Batman 
 If Commissioner Gordon didn't ignore the dissonant warnings 
 Than it'd have surely been a different story 
 All together for the better 
 The prisoners all lead a sinister life a criminal orgy 
 Living inside a wicked and vile despicable isle 
 Sicker than bile 
 But it's evident I'm a vigilant militant 
 Willing to kill them with brilliant diligent skill and the guile 
 Of a killer with infinite style 
 Jack White is quite insane, and while I'm fighting Bane 
 I find a titan-like strain flowing rife inside his veins 
 It's the same the Joker's trying to synthesise in doses high as planes 
 I'm tired of games, It's time for change 
 To time to take is smile away, hey 
 How long has Killer Croc been a cock? 
 My trap'll leave him reeling like a spinning top 
 And I willn't stop until his locked up in a box 
 Sit and watch me fighting pound for pound with Poison Ivy 
 A vigilante plant antidote without my boys behind me 
 Horticulture's not the sort of culture to be taken lightly 
 I take an eighth of titan now I'm feelin' slightly hyphy 
 I might be quite that as high that I can see inside me psyche 
 Me, I'm so fly that I can fly, crikey 
 Batman, Batman
