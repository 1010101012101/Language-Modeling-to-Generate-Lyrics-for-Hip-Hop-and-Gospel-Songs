Go! 
 Hello, Pandora fans 
 I'd like to show my awesome plans 
 Hold on tight to your organs, glands 
 We're riding back to the Borderlands 
 When I hear that Gearbox 
 Are releasin' a sequel, my teardrops 
 Are uncontrollable 
 I'm inconsolable, but fear not 
 They're tears of joy, like me as a boy 
 After Christmas Eve when I see a box 
 I open it up and say "whoa" at the view 
 It's only overflowin' with loot 
 Lockin' and loadin', I know what to do 
 Now who am I going to shoot? 
 You, you're a pitiful prick 
 So I'm ripping you up with a critical hit 
 Funds improve my guns and loot 
 I'll use it if it'll fit 
 If it moves I'll shoot it, you tit 
 I'm a buzzard, you're a blue tit 
 I fly in the sky and it's fatal 
 Foes are lying disabled 
 A hole in their face; I'm reminded of bagels 
 I'm ever so slightly unstable 
 Me? I'm hardly an angel 
 Leave that to the Guardian Angel 
 This is the eighties, I'm Arnie 
 And painfully makin' your army unfaithful 
 Health and safety; watch your head 
 Heavy metal; lots of lead 
 But before I drop you dead 
 I'll shred you up like Dr. Zed 
 I said "Zed, let him in" 
 Led Zeppelin 
 Never played on David Letterman 
 Though that may be irrelevant 
 Nevertheless it's a hell of method of making it evident 
 Dan is the cleverest rapper 
 To ever use gamin' in tracks 
 Setting a precedent that wouldn't ever be bettered 
 Till weapons are made into raps 
 Eighty seven bazillion guns 
 A similar number of brilliant puns 
 Turn that to cash, gimme the funds 
 Back to back with my militant chums 
 I'm blastin' stacks of straps at prats 
 It's action packed ridiculous fun 
 If kills were calories, that'd be fattenin' 
 Fragging a skag and I'm baggin' and taggin' him 
 Having you laggin' and manically panicking 
 Man, is it actually happenin'? 
 Well, I'm an assassin assassinin' you 
 So if that is a fact then it has to be true 
 You're chatting Claptrap 
 So I should grab your nadsack and yank it 
 So your nads are dropping 
 Like the stock is on the NASDAQ 
 Asshat, don't answer back 
 Who the fuck is Handsome Jack? 
 You want how many grams of that? 
 I'll grind you like my ganja sack 
 I will be havin' you cryin' in agony 
 Violently crackin' your violin; Paganini 
 Meeny miny mo 
 More money, less problems 
 The bigger the gun, the less nonsense 
 I'm less Mark Ronson, more Charles Bronson 
 Or a vault Hunter S. Thompson 
 Said I'm less Mark Ronson, more Charles Bronson 
 Or a vault Hunter S. Thompson 
 Less Mark Ronson, more Charles Bronson 
 Or a vault Hunter S. Thompson 
 I'm less Mark Ronson, more Charles Bronson 
 Or a vault Hunter S. Thompson 
 I'm less Mark Ronson, more Charles Bronson 
 Or a vault Hunter S. Thompson
