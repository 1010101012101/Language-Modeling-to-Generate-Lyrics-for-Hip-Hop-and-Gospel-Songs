Ah, greetings young soldier 
 Come, join by the fire 
 And let me regale you with tales of 
 What the fuck is cracking 
 We're in an ancient time, we face an ancient threat 
 Civilisation's never dream this kind of danger yet 
 Historians are self-assured but they forget the daily tribulations 
 Of the cases from the place and age who met 
 Mythological creatures with the oddest of features 
 At this moment there's no place fricking horrid as Greece is 
 Until I cross the seas to Egypt and see that 
 When they say they've got a problem, they really mean it 
 For Prometheus, it seems that getting me's the easiest 
 Way they could alleviate the evil that is bleeding us 
 But I'm one of leagues of heroes, you best believe in us 
 It takes every drop of faith to battle evil thus 
 I tackled hell fire, to travel to Delphi 
 And fight what I find from Jackalmen to Telkines 
 I leave at least ten beastmen deceased, dead 
 Each second, 'cause I reckon they don't really even need breath 
 I cleave heads like a watermelon before telling a Merchant 
 Whatever he still hasn't bought, I'm selling 
 I've got to get the loot, the best produced 
 So I look fricking godlike whenever I'm next to you 
 From Greece to China, you'll never see a finer sort 
 I keep a pile of horns of Minotaurs and Gorgon Queens' vaginal walls 
 Purely for the reason that I coul arrive at home 
 And write and then recite this vile rhyme for y'all 
 I never meant to babble on but when I get to Babylon 
 I'm still only part way on the hard path I travel on 
 You won't find a travelodge here in the wilderness 
 The plans are just as dangerous as every building is 
 Filled with a selection of enemies to be killed 
 And it's down to you how you choose skills that you will kill them with 
 Are you built like a brick shit house or is using spells more a soothing sound? 
 Ensure you're choosing well 
 I'm felling skeletons as if I'm an elephant 
 Then a second later I'm repelling them with elegance 
 They're in the closet and I'm burying the evidence 
 I call the force of nature, every one of the four elements 
 I've been through countless winters, heat that'd burn hell to cinders 
 Just to lead me now to the heaving mound at Mount Olympus 
 I climb and shout "Oi, come out now and fight the best 
 Mortal to walk tall the final bout of Titan Quest" 
 Bars 
 Now, you may think these are the ramblings of a drunked old soldier 
 And you'd probably be right but when the shit hits the fan 
 Whatever a fan is, don't say I didn't warn you
