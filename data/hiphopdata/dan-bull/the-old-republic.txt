Forget the Rancor, Daniel's in the lion's lair 
 I'm a starfighter, you're flying Ryanair 
 I visited BioWare, dined on their chinaware 
 With a pipe, a pair of slippers and reclinin' chair 
 I'm aware my rare dialect's more fluent 
 Than a protocol droid with a rhymin' flair 
 I'm gettin' quite a strain in my neck 
 'Cause I've got a bigger brain than a Twi'lek 
 Yep, I'm called Dan, I'm a Star Wars fan 
 Far more than you, I'm hardcore, man 
 From Korriban to Coruscant 
 Alderaan to Dromund Kaas 
 I drop the hottest raps 
 I am the top of the class 
 I'm a Jedi Knight, led by my skill 
 To kill whoever I like 
 I'm a murderer, you're a nerf herder, bruh 
 I got ya coffin, I don't mean tubercular 
 Ha! 
 I'm an Imperial Agent, you're merely a vagrant 
 Look, Jabba the Hutt's butt's nearly as fragrant 
 I can take a track about the Old Republic 
 And make it so banging it becomes a club hit 
 I'm a bounty hunter about to plunder 
 The Senate for 100,000 Credits 
 So no doubt you wonder just how I get it 
 Bumping louder than the sound of thunder 
 You're more annoying than a crowd of Gungans 
 A bloody Ewok could get you out your bunker 
 I'm a Sith Inquisitor 
 You're nothing but a Gullipud Prannock 
 I'm a Planetary Governor 
 And I'm a smuggler, you're ugly 
 Your balls haven't dropped, you must be a juggler 
 Rub-a-dub, three dugs in a tub 
 Two of them are being buggered 
 So you must be the buggerer 
 Space hustler, straight huffin' 
 And then puffin' and then blowin' 
 Your space station up 
 In a ball of flame, no ball and chain 
 'Cause I take no prisoners, I'm causin' pain 
 A devout Sith, straight out the mythology 
 Taking out colonies easy, you're helpless 
 I easily leave each of you outlived, yeah 
 You should have a bad feelin' about this 
 Dan Bull 
 I've got a massive collection 
 Of original Star Wars figutes 
 Many in the original packaging 
 I've got a Yak Face 
 I've got Yak Face 
 Type in 'Yak Face action figure' on eBay 
 That's how I roll
