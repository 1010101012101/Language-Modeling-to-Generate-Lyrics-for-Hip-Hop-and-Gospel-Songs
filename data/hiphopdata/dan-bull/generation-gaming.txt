Monopoly was not for me 
 Chess made me stressed out 
 So the only way I could get down was with 
 Pocket electronics and bleeps 
 Ever since my Game Boy made toys obsolete 
 I've been a well behaved boy 
 That played inside and stayed off the streets 
 Yes, so I got my electric shocks 
 From Tetris blocks and Mario Land 
 But there wasn't much room for much for mushrooms 
 I was the man, man 
 With the pad in my hand 
 Hammerin' at it while eating my breakfast 
 Bein' the best 
 That was the plan 
 Beatin' the rest 
 And leavin' them breathless 
 Please believe me 
 Nobody could beat me at Tetris 
 I fuckin' rock 
 Droppin' blocks like heads 
 I'm choppin' blocks 
 I was on some Next shit 
 And I still got a flame 
 For puzzle games 
 Like HD Hexic 
 But when the PC came 
 My gaming taste became eclectic 
 This day's grim (It's raining) 
 It's raining 
 What wonderful weather for gaming 
 The sun's blazing (The sun's blazing) 
 So let's stay in 
 It's wonderful weather for gaming 
 I was the geeky one 
 I really wanted a PC CD-ROM 
 And got it 
 8-mega RAM 
 A CRT screen 
 She was some top kit 
 Free moments were devoted 
 To keystrokes 
 And the odd click 
 Far more into dark forces then 
 Even the Star Wars kid 
 And Civilization II is a brilliant game 
 That you really should play and I still do today 
 Computer games improve your brain 
 It's proven, mate 
 So if you behave in stupid ways 
 Then please refrain from blaming GTA 
 I really hate excuses 
 I may just shoot my teacher's face 
 Nah, I'm already embroiled 
 In getting these Tesla coils 
 Ready in my base 
 The Russians are comin' 
 With trucks full of gunmen 
 I need to be safe 
 But maybe the green beret 
 Could lead the way 
 And see us through 
 At least till we replace 
 The PC games 
 With PS2 
 This day's grim (It's raining) 
 It's raining 
 What wonderful weather for gaming 
 The sun's blazing (The sun's blazing) 
 So let's stay in 
 It's wonderful weather for gaming 
 Takin' control of 
 Somebody else's console 
 With no remorse 
 I was so debauched 
 My only thoughts 
 Were total scores on Tony Hawk's 
 Or runnin' amok 
 In Smuggler's Run 
 Smugglin' guns and drugs 
 For fun 
 And pullin' a gun on 
 Any NPC I see or stumble upon 
 GTA III made me inclined 
 To kill repeatedly 
 The spinal chills of Silent Hill 
 Are still on my mind and 
 Creepin' me the fuck out 
 Look out, pull out your sawn-off shotgun 
 'Cause there's a hot zombie nurse 
 That wants to hurt you 
 And cut off your oxygen 
 But as much as asphyxiation 
 May be lots of fun 
 I've got a crush, a fixation 
 With PlayStation 
 I'm in love 
 So I said to the PS2 
 "Me and you need a breather" 
 Then in 3 clicks 
 I ordered an Xbox 360 off eBay 
 This day's grim (It's raining) 
 It's raining 
 What wonderful weather for gaming 
 The sun's blazing (The sun's blazing) 
 So let's stay in 
 It's wonderful weather for gaming 
 So we switched teams to the 360 
 Glitch free 
 Lots of slick features 
 HD, HDD, I don't miss leads 
 Gears is my gear 
 But I gets my hits from Hitman 
 The BioShock has Mass Effect 
 As I sink into Oblivion 
 Splinter Cell's mint as well 
 And Rainbow Six takes no prisoners 
 It's the business 
 And the cover system's fuckin' wicked 
 Duckin' and chuckin' a frag 
 Blind fire from behind 
 Piles of rubble and zippin' them up in a bag 
 I'm lovin' the lack of health packs 
 Puttin' a plaster on a fracture 
 Or a shrapnel gash 
 What the hell's that? 
 In the new generation 
 Of computer gamin' 
 You hold the left trigger half way down 
 Or let the computer do the aiming 
 So what are you complainin' for 
 "The Forza scoreboard's been reset" 
 Shut up and improve your Gamerscore 
 Before you get the dreaded Red Ring of Death 
 This day's grim (It's raining) 
 It's raining 
 What wonderful weather for gaming 
 The sun's blazing (The sun's blazing) 
 David's raiding 
 It's wonderful weather for gaming
