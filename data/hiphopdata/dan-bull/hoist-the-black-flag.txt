Alright, lads 
 I'm one of the only people who have heard Edward Kenway rap 
 And live to tell the tale 
 And now I'm going to tell you exactly what he said 
 He said: 
 These aren't the high seas, they're my seas 
 It's likely you'll find me inciting some maritime crises 
 Plunder all the prizes from the skies to under water 
 Thunderballing, then I'm back aboard in time for my tea 
 Tides are dicey, you're dicing with death 
 Like a diver fighting to rise for a breath 
 I'm a tycoon taking lives like a typhoon 
 Hypothesizing that you're probably dying quite soon 
 But at least in the meantime you can enjoy listening to my tune 
 It's an assassin sea shanty, so pass the neat brandy 
 And raise a glass to my sea-faring vigilantes 
 Right lads, pack your bags 
 And come aboard as we hoist the Black Flag 
 I said right lads, pack your bags 
 And come aboard as we hoist the Black Flag 
 Look, I'm a canny one, scourge of the Seven Seas 
 Sink anyone's galleon to murder my enemies 
 Whether he's been stabbed in a backstreet 
 Or a vast sea attack by the Black Flag fleet 
 Kicking people in the ribs, I leap from ship to ship 
 And clean the deck of crew as if I'm sweeping, never miss a bit 
 No need for cruise missiles, I wield dual pistols 
 And rule this world from Kingston to Bristol 
 So you better make headway for Edward Kenway 
 Or I'll hit you hard enough to send you to next Wednesday 
 I make the hardest seafaring men say 
 "Get away from this fellow if you treasure your gems" 
 They say that he ranks amongst the most clever 
 Of the gentleman adventurers without measure 
 He spends half his time looking for exotic treasure 
 And the other half lusting for erotic pleasure 
 Right lads, pack your bags 
 And come aboard as we hoist the Black Flag 
 I said right lads, pack your bags 
 And come aboard as we hoist the Black Flag 
 From England to Kingston to New Holland 
 He's a looting, shooting, Henry fooking Rollins
