Dan Bull 
 This is a letter to Bethesda 
 In which I beg you to stick together 
 For new Elder Scrolls and you flippin' better 
 Otherwise I'm gonna pester you forever, well 
 Except when I'm playing Fallout: New Vegas this November 
 But please we need another Elder Scrolls 
 If I don't a hold o' one I'll go out of control 
 Sure Fallout was a whole different level and it was incredible 
 But it didn't have the visual elegance and mystic mythic elements 
 That lifted it through excellence and into sheer perfectionism 
 Transcendence isn't something I'd expect sitting next to computers 
 But what you presented to us is beauteous 
 Playin' Oblivion made me oblivious to my surroundings 
 How could a game be this intricate? 
 But after a thousand hours of play 
 I'm still enthralled with it all now to this day 
 I've found an escape from the imperial prison of everyday livin' 
 So take me to Oblivion again 
 Take me to Oblivion again 
 Take me to Oblivion 
 Baron Samedi 
 Thanks Dan I couldn't of put it better 
 Get it together, Bethesda or we'll keep pendin' you letters 
 Being a thought dweller was special but wet was forgettable 
 So I'll never settle for anything less than an Elder Scrolls 
 Consumed by Bloodmoon swallowed by Morrowind 
 When I step into Oblivion I'm instantly lost in it 
 Escape the modern concrete office 
 But not only when I pop the DVD-ROM in the slot and unlock my dreams 
 Grab my magic hat, my daggers and a Wabbajack 
 Pack them in the saddle bag and travel through these savage lands 
 It's quite depressin' how obsessed I was getting 
 With checking out every chest to collect every set of weapons 
 I stand on the planet's edge and gaze at the hazy seas 
 It's crazy how ones and zeros behave so amazingly 
 Take me from these rainy streets 
 Please Take me to Oblivion again 
 Please take me to Oblivion
