(Dead Man Walkn) 
 You're a dead man walking going hard on the brakes 
 It's like you're Dead Man Walkn going hard on the breaks 
 I'm going to LA to roll over you, es√© 
 Then I've got to get to New York today, roll over USA 
 Set the car onto cruise control 
 And roll on the roads that my crews control 
 Nothing hits harder than damn bull bars 
 I mean, nothing hits harder than Dan Bull bars 
 Race in a race with me? You'll blow your tyre out 
 Go face to face with me? You blow, you'll tire out 
 Car to car I'll always have more torque in a bout 
 Disagree or think differently? What you talking about? 
 I'm street racing in your borough, underground 
 Chasing you bunnies back to your burrow, underground 
 I killed and left your pet Kookaburra on the ground 
 Then bring a spade to its grave, bruh, and dig 'round 
 My favourite place to import coffee from 
 And the type of instant coffee that I like? 
 Burundi, ground

 This is the chorus of the song

 This is the chorus of the song

 When I'm in my car I'm going hard with it, you be soft 
 You're in the pits when I wave the Black Flag, Ubisoft 
 They could try and stop us in a copse and rob us 
 Modern Highwaymen, it's real life cops and robbers 
 You tried to build a little scene and got no-one to show for it 
 I jacked a limousine, now there's no-one to chauffeur it 
 I'll tailgate your Mercedes-Benz 
 Until you hit a tree and see how your Mercedes bends 
 I don't just flip a policeman, I flip the police, man 
 When you hear a siren you're like: "Flip, the police, man!" 
 My fans are like my wheels with the screeches I elicit 
 Hey listen, your track record just isn't as ill, is it? 
 Illicit street courier, good at getting gear 
 Look at you struggle with the clutch, you couldn't get in gear 
 I'm an important geez, importing keys 
 I'm feared by the stevedores in ports and quays 
 If my car reaches a river then I'll take it to the bridge 
 Where I'll make like James Brown and take it to the bridge 
 This is the chorus of the song

 This is the chorus of the song 
 (The Crew) 
 This is the chorus of the song 
 (The Crew) 
 This is the chorus of the song 
 (The Crew) 
 I'm a lyrical and homonymical brain 
 That's why I made every line the same
