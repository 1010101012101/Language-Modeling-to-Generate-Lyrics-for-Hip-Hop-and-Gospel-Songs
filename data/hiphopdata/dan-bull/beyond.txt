I am Aiden and I reside inside of the mind 
 Or right by the side of the life that I have been tied with 
 I'm a violent type of vibrant light 
 That scientists have tried to describe 
 Since I was thrown along with Jodie, the only one to know me 
 Disowned by her folks to a zone so lonely 
 Caged for precaution, strange little orphan 
 She has a knack for actions, replacing the talking 
 We give a demonstration to Nathan Dawkins 
 But all it takes is for Clayton to walk in 
 The situation changes, I may need a forfeit 
 The truth's twofold, seek what the truth holds 
 Peek through the view to Beyond: Two Souls 
 The truth's twofold, seek what the truth holds 
 Peek through the view to Beyond: Two Souls 
 Hark, I'm the noise that you hear after dark 
 The cold chill feeling that you fear with half your heart 
 There's no need to train me in martial arts 
 A supernatural human, that's all, imagine you in that form 
 Picture what you would do if you could choose the platform 
 Traverse the universe, moving through the back door 
 Schr√∂dinger's H4XOR, what did you kill that cat for? 
 Is it Jodie or Ellen Page? Deity or David Cage 
 Reality's a game we play, grab a seat and save the day 
 I saw a snail crawling straight across a razor blade 
 And it escaped unscathed, no sign of violence 
 There's no use, it's futile trying hiding, I am Aiden 
 The truth's twofold, seek what the truth holds 
 Peek through the view to Beyond: Two Souls 
 The truth's twofold, seek what the truth holds 
 Peek through the view to Beyond: Two Souls
