Call it parkour, but hardcore 
 I make killing an art form 
 Death's cold taste, sweet as Carte D'Or 
 No need to start wars for a difference of opinion 
 Gimme the name of your antagonist, I'll stick 'em in the ribs 
 Because I'm an assassin, one with a passion for innovative rapping 
 Droppin' so fast you're probably havin' a problem to follow the captions 
 I'm so ahead of my time, I'm probably rappin' backwards 
 I'm a scholar of Latin with a masters in dispatchin' 
 Anybody that's hasslin' one of my customers 
 I cuts them up and shuts them up in a casket 
 What you've got to do is ask 
 And I'll have grabbed and then stabbed them in the abdomen that minute 
 And be finished with the killin' before you've finished with askin' 
 A bird of prey with Terminator's murder rate 
 I'm servin' plates of pain up like a perverse buffet 
 Take you to the pearly gates 
 I'll impersonate a passerby 
 You wouldn't bat an eye until your circulations pacified 
 So practiced, I couldn't count the crimes I've perpetrated 
 How many spines of vertebrates I've snapped 
 My raps travel through sound and time 
 Reverberate through generations, permeate 
 My serenade regurgitated through a nerd rapper's recitation to your earthly playlist 
 So I'd say this was a revelation 
 (Was a revelation) 
 A revelation 
 (A revelation) 
 A revelation 
 (A revelation 
 A revelation)
