Oh Mojang, I can feel the soil falling over my head 
 And as I climb into an empty bed, oh well, enough said 
 Dear Microsoft, we've got something to say 
 You just traded for the biggest indie game in the indie game 
 It just doesn't do it justice just to pin it with the indie name 
 It's amazing just how big this thing became, it's been through stages 
 Came straight from a beta on a forum into history's pages 
 But now the fanbase weeps through flushed and misty faces 
 No wish to see the game with Windows 8's interfaces 
 Listen, it isn't as if we hate you, we're just resisting changes 
 Gamergate displayed it pays to listen when players are pissed and dangerous 
 It's over, still I cling 
 I don't know what else I can play 
 Oh Mojang, I can feel the soaring overheads 
 I know it's business but there is this; look 
 I know it's business but there is this; look 
 This game means so, so much to so many people 
 I can't think of a single community with any equal 
 There's the streamers, the hardcore and casual players 
 PC, console, mobile, YouTubers making a living from ads on players 
 Construction on creation, Bukkit, Tekkit, Hunger Games 
 And tons of contries' young teenagers 
 That've become each other's neighbors, Steve's become a savior 
 Please don't leave him to become a slave here, I pray to you 
 Mojang staff, please be happy 
 Corporate suits, don't be brutes 
 Loud loutish logo, treat them kindly 
 As though they need you more than they love you 
 You might think I'm daft, asking you to be nice to Minecraft 
 But I don't mind that, so laugh, my life is quite naff 
 I've an appetite for trite trash, many nights I've pined, sat 
 With wine or sank a pint glass and passed the time with Minecraft 
 The game's a mate in the bad times I've had, the sad times I've had 
 But when I craft, those sad times don't matter, no 
 So you might think I'm daft, asking you to be nice to Minecraft 
 But I don't mind that, as long as you look after Minecraft 
 Don't mind that, as long as you look after Minecraft 
 It's over and it never really began 
 But in my heart it was so real 
 And Notch even spoke to me and said 
 "If you're so funny 
 Then why are you on your own tonight? 
 And if your channel's so good 
 Then why do you stream alone tonight? 
 I know 'cause tonight is just like any other night 
 That's why you're on your own tonight 
 With you're mine and your farms 
 While they're in each other's arms" 
 It's so easy to craft, it's so easy to slay 
 It takes strength to descend in the mine 
 It's so easy to laugh and poke fun at Bill Gates 
 It takes guts to attempt such a buy 
 Oh Mojang, oh Mojang 
 Oh Mozza, I can feel the DMCA over my head 
 This is a parody, don't grief, content ID, please
