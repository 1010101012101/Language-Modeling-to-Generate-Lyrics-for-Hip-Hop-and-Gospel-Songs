spoken: 
 What a day we're having 
 Out in the garden, having fun 
 It's one of those days but when the sun rays blaze 
 You don't even get burnt 
 And when it rains, it's like liquid sunshine, magic! 
 I bring the beat to life, speak my mind, people take a peek inside 
 Believe I'm nice, hear me defy thee to even find an MC as deep as I 
 A decent guy, sweet as a piece of pecan pie when he combines 
 Beats and rhymes even blind people might see the light 
 Beaming bright either side, gleaming like streets at night 
 So seek and ye shall find peace of mind, deep inside 
 No need to read the fine lined print or reason why 
 Don't even try, ask me and I will be your guide 
 Lead you by the hand and you will see the sights 
 Feel a vibe tease your spine and leave you feeling fine 
 You'll be excited to be alive 
 From calves, knees and thighs to heartbeats and minds 
 We can lead a life of peace and kindness or we can fight, just 
 Rise until the sun's in your eyes 
 Rise until the sun's in your eyes 
 Rise until the sun's in your eyes 
 Rise until the sun's in your eyes 
 My eagle eye will read between the lines and see the lies these deceivers write 
 They cynically decide the things you need to buy and then repeat the cycle 
 Until the people all believe it's right 
 We need to realise it's free to be polite and treat a being like he or she is being equalised 
 Don't know why we demonise and penalise, effectively illegalize genotypes 
 What happened to being nice? To each and every being we see alive 
 Treat them right, that's why me I keep on trying to lead a vegan life though cheese is nice 
 We eat the seasons, spices, denying the beast beneath has rights 
 'Cause keeping meat inside us is a sign that here lies a survivor, no need to read the rites 
 We succeeded quite well enough, it's tough enough to put the greed aside 
 Even I let ego stride in and feed my pride but if we can rise above conceit and fight 
 For love, then we can climb the peaks, till finally goodbye 
 From our teeth and eyes to heartbeats and minds you've seen us lead a life of peace and kindness 
 Get off your seat and 
 Rise until the sun's in your eyes 
 Rise until the sun's in your eyes 
 Rise until the sun's in your eyes 
 Rise until the sun's in your eyes
