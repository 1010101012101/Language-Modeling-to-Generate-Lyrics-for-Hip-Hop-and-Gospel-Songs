Oh, low lights 
 Low lights 
 Lights that are low 
 Lights that are low 
 I ain't talkin' about highlights 
 They got too much limelight 
 If we lay low light 
 Then it's no light 
 Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout low lights 
 Low, "good-to-go" lights 
 Those "steal-the-whole-goddamn-show" lights 
 Them good ol' low lights
