The 1980s was a time of strife, the Falklands War, the miners' strikes 
 The poor got poorer, while all of the fat cats had the time of their life 
 Now Shaun was a troubled lad, who could have had a family, could have had a mum and dad, but his dad 
 Went away and wasn't coming back, and he just wanted someone to understand that fact 
 And that's exactly what happened one day in a dank underpass 
 It'd come to pass that some cunts were laughing at his mum's fashion and he'd had enough of that 
 He come across a couple of lads having a chuckle that asked him what was up? What's the matter? 
 So he told them the answer and they brightened him right up with their banter 
 Till Gadget come back with a grudge and some cans and demanded "budge or I'll batter you" 
 So Shaun goes home alone, he knows the ropes of the fuckery that's happening 
 He roams the lonely roads and knows there's no one to trust and be happy with 
 But next day there's a tap on the pane of his glass, it came from the path and it's Gadget 
 He's asking if Shaun wants to play, but Shaun isn't sure what to say 
 Woody wants to know would he want to go because he's sorry for the other day 
 Boys will be boys, buildings destroyed with military toys, the voiceless 
 Youth amused by noise, abuse, let loose, an excuse to avoid the truth 
 Loosen the noose for a moment till they have to go home to a home that's hopeless 
 New shoes just won't cut it, if you want to let your hair down, go and cut it 
 A new suit, boots and braces, new mates to play with, share the pain with 
 Parents hate it, scared of changes, and letting their little tearaways get away with it 
 They're at an age where they'll go to parties and be exposed to the harsh things 
 It's hard being dark seeing as the friends of your friends are incredibly right wing 
 He can't mean what he says, he's a mate but he's asking you whether you're Jamaican or 
 English, because your skin's different to his he considers you insidious 
 Then shit begins to get serious, how did we get here to this? 
 Giving a talk on the British and forces being killed in the war in the Falklands 
 Then Shaun took a swing at him all because this was the war where he nearly was orphaned 
 Awful things happen, you have to draw a line, with a choice to walk away or stay behind 
 Combo saw what the naked eye couldn't, the pain inside Shaun that made him ripe 
 For the patriots' fight for the land so he made them shake hands and say goodbye 
 Sad, but it must be. It was time to take a drive, and travel the country 
 And after the National Front meet, Sean got moved from the back to the front seat 
 Truly one of the gang and a thug, see, that's when stuff really began to get ugly 
 Tagging profanities in backstreets, bashing Pakistanis and black peeps 
 Threatening to slash cheeks, a new flag and a tat on the back of the hand 
 That's for keeps, our protagonist seems to have forgotten how to ask for sweets 
 These acts in the past were petty, but who can backchat to a machete? 
 Brandished by an angry fascist heavy, "put that away Meggy, your ass is sweaty" 
 Gadge and the lads grabbed fags and bevvies, cans of Pepsi, then ran back 
 Through the entry, left the shop totally messy, adrenaline sent Combo in a frenzy 
 Head red, heart hopeless and empty, it's a headwreck why folks are unfriendly 
 To people of a different origin, 'cause what has skin got to do with it, we're all wandering 
 Through the shit, the human condition is truly a mission for a lunatic to live in 
 So we stick to wishing eachother well as long as we think that they're wishing it as well 
 That's why they gave the Asian living hell before baking a cake now they're giving it to Smell 
 Skins have relationship issues as well, and given the days he's been living in a cell 
 Can you blame Combo for his difficulties now? There isn't much to dwell on for prisoners but how long 
 Until they're coming out. But I tell you this, getting blitzed isn't really gonna help 
 Sitting in a flat getting fried with a black guy, issues in the back of your mind as he acts like 
 He's got everything you never had and wish you did, rubbing it in your face, who is this kid 
 Immigrant from another race taking British priviliges, a nigger, ripping the piss 
 Gonna give him a kick in the face, a bit of discipline'll stick him in his place, a sickening disgrace 
 Beat him senseless; he's defenceless, leave your friend bleeding, please just end this 
 Immediately the grief and regret sets in, left one of your best friends with his head 
 Decked in, you better get checked in to the A and E, lock yourself up, chuck away the 
 Key. When the world's on your shoulders you've got to be a soldier because 
 Real men don't cry 
 Real men don't cry
