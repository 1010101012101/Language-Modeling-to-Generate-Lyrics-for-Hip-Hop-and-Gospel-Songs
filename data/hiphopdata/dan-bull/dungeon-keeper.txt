Me? I'm Horny, short for the Horned Reaper 
 I'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper 
 Unbelievers better take a step back 
 Because I set traps till they leave your necks snapped 
 Forget a pimp slap, switch up the syntax 
 Take away the P, see I deliver imp slaps 
 There's a slim chance that you've ever seen an enemy 
 With melanin as red as this; the menacingest skin rash 
 Better bring your shin pads 'cause when I swing axes 
 There's an equal need for medicine and bin bags 
 I'm Horny, short for the Horned Reaper 
 I'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper 
 I'm Horny, short for the Horned Reaper 
 I'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper 
 You ought to have taken a tad more care 
 With your fortification 'cause that wall there's 
 Gonna fall and then cave in, I'll nab your lair 
 You'll be sore as the day when I stabbed your bare 
 Bottom and in case you've forgotten 
 I hail from a place that is fatally rotten 
 So debased I can make even Satan pee off 
 And I must say that is painfully often 
 Your safe, I'm unlockin', knickin' your millions 
 Stickin' your minions straight in a coffin 
 I plunge in to your dungeon, lungin' through your little buggers 
 Like I'm cuttin' through an onion 
 Under ye' foot, plunder ye' loot 
 Funnelin' your funds to me, can you compute? 
 The heart of your dungeons the dungeon heart 
 I'm taking pleasure, breaking it and pulling it apart 
 Then take your treasure, claiming it as bullion in carts 
 Now you see red, I'm the bully in the dark 
 I'm Horny, short for the Horned Reaper 
 I'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper 
 I'm Horny, short for the Horned Reaper 
 I'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper 
 The hand of evil strikes again
