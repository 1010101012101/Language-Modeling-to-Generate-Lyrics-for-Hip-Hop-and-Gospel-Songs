Me? I rap about games! 
 (Yeah, we've gathered that by now) 
 Who said I can't rap about board games, bruv 
 (Somebody, presumably) 
 Keepin' it old school, init bruv? 
 (Yes it is) 
 Check it 
 (Ch-check it) 
 I'm not a property magnate, I'm a property magnet 
 Your offers, I'm knocking them back quick as if I'm popping a tablet 
 Not stopping till I've got in the last bid 
 I splash quids side to side like my ad libs 
 Damn rich, made of bread like a sandwich 
 Six figure plus cash sums are my language 
 Turning every opportunity to my advantage 
 So I can afford anything I've ever fancied 
 Shh, here's an advanced tip to fill up your bank quick 
 Buy everything you fricking can while you're in transit 
 Take out the other gangs quick, Bloods and Crips 
 Make their bank balance even tighter than your hand grips 
 Fingers clamp tipped like a titanium vice when I'm shaking the dice 
 You didn't take my advice and I'm not saying it twice 
 Alright, I'm saying it twice, I'm bankrupting you so say your goodbyes 
 Uh 
 Do not pass Go and do not collect two hundred dollars 
 I'm a cataclysm of capitalism 
 Stacking the dividends as I rap on the rhythm 
 I'm lacking humility, never lacking in income 
 This isn't a city, it's a kingdom 
 I got dat Monopoly money 
 You're not going to take my property from me 
 I got dat Monopoly money 
 You're not going to take my property from me 
 I'm not going to lie; the Monopoly guy 
 Looks impossibly fly in a top hat, moustache and a tie 
 I properly rock at Monopoly, you're probably not going to topple me 
 Even if your house burned down it wouldn't be hot property 
 Got money on my mind, I might require a lobotomy 
 I'm all about the green and I'm not discussing botany 
 But ruck with me and I might need to lick some broccoli 
 You're economically unsound like an art degree 
 My pocket's deep enough to feed everyone sleeping rough 
 But you don't beat the competition treating poverty 
 I'm really sorry that there's people that aren't eating properly 
 I acknowledge it's a problem, but not for me 
 What, you really think I'd know how to play fair? 
 When I was raised in a hotel on Mayfair? 
 I'd prefer to stay here, you can stay there 
 But as you're passing by, you'd better pay the fare 
 I'm a cataclysm of capitalism 
 Stacking the dividends as I rap on the rhythm 
 I'm lacking humility, never lacking in income 
 This isn't a city, it's a kingdom 
 Monopoly, hot property 
 I am Dan Bull and I rock a beat 
 Monopoly, hot property 
 I am Dan Bull and I rock a beat 
 Has anyone ever actually finished a Monopoly game 
 Without overturning the board and throwing little buildings everywhere? 
 Not me, not me 
 Consoles? You're next
