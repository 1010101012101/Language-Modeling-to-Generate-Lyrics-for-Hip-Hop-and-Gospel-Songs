The fungus' hunger has plundered and plummeted us 
 From the humdrum to the hunted as the country crumbles to dust 
 The life of a survivor's living in quarantine 
 This isn't a holiday, this is military policy 
 There's a rift, as emboldened, we shift the balance of power 
 I'm just a citizen: Joel, unwilling man of the hour 
 'Cause all I want to do is end it but my solitude depends 
 On whether I fulfil an old promise to a friend 
 I've smuggled guns, I've smuggled diamonds and pearls 
 But I've never been entrusted with the life of a girl 
 I must ride beside her to the Fireflies, mind's in a whirl 
 They might as well reside the other side of the world 
 (The Last of Us) 
 It's a new definition of the term "urban jungle" 
 (The Last of Us) 
 Shit hasn't gone viral, it's gone fungal 
 Infected detected tote the pistol, load clips 
 These filthy clothes show that it's a twisted road trip 
 I'm ragged and smelly, might as well act like a scally 
 And smack a chap's scalp in with a bat in an alley 
 "How many's that we've capped then, Captain O'Malley?" 
 It'd take an honor student graduate of math for the tally 
 In the past me and Ellie for having massacred many 
 Would have made a prime time newscast on the telly 
 You bastards are jelly, you're just going to have to get ready 
 For us to blast brain matter on the map like confetti 
 I school undead with tools, combust them up efficiently 
 Like fuel unleaded, leave the fools unheaded 
 And if they're dumb enough to come up wrangling with me 
 Then I leave cadavers mangled as they dangle from a tree 
 And on a planet this unglamorously bleak 
 You should probably be thankful to be free
