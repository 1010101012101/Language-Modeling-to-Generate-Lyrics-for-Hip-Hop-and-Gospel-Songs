Her name's Lara Croft and this is the way that she started off 
 She hits land, stranded in the wreck of the Endurance 
 She probably should have got better insurance 
 The challenges ahead are gonna test her performance 
 So endurance is of the utmost importance 
 Limited ordnance, she'll really have to use her wits 
 Now the developers appear to have reduced her tits 
 Dragon's Triangle, here's a house of lunatics 
 Darker than the night sky during a lunar eclipse 
 No clips to put into the gun, you know and 
 No gun so it's a good job she brung her bow 
 Unarmed, not locked, loaded 
 Going hard with a longbow, depart you with one blow 
 Prognosis: a disarmament pronto 
 Shots popping off as if there was a lock-in 
 In the bar with the Cointreau, top row combo 
 From the coast of the Arctic to the heart of the Congo 
 Lara's banging heads harder than bongos 
 And angering her enemies, like a mom joke 
 Tomb Raider's a tune that'll invade your brain 
 (Get in her way and she'll make you taste the pain)

 Shh, this is the bit of the track in which I kill it with triplet raps 
 It doesn't particularly add to the narrative but it's a blast 
 There isn't a faster Brit on the map who's spitting as wicked as that 
 So I suggest you give it a clap or I'll give you a slap 
 An aristocrat whose bars are hotter than ovens 
 Did I tell you the fact that Lara Croft is my cousin? 
 I'm dropping a dozen hip hoppy productions a week 
 To leave you properly buzzing and it's costing you nothing 
 I'm pretty sure than Nishimura should be hitting the record button 
 Soon as I walk up and talk upon Tomb Raider 
 Like a doomsdaying saber-toothed soothsayer 
 Till then I'll see you dudes later, touch√© huh? 
 Tomb Raider's a tune that'll invade your brain 
 (Get in her way and she'll make you taste the pain)
