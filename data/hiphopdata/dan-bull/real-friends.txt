Real friends, the sort of people you can 
 Tell your deepest secrets to 
 That you can wear your underpants 
 In front of them and not feel ashamed 
 Real friends are the sort of people you can 
 Gather 'round a biscuit 
 Race to see who can make that biscuit soggy 
 And, again, not feel ashamed 
 In fact, quite the opposite; proud 
 Real friends are the sort of people that don't care 
 Whether you've killed a man 
 Or whether you've crept into the grounds of a 
 Of a school in the middle of the night 
 And torched the fucker down 
 Real friends look beyond the surface 
 They look at what's underneath 
 The blood, the guts, the mucus 
 The bile, that sort of thing
