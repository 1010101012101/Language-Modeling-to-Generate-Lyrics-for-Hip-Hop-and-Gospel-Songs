I'm fresh forever 
 Can I get a witness 
 Drop a can of paint 
 Grind more business 
 I'm the type to rock yellow diamonds that match my car 
 You the type to live under a rock, patrick star 
 And I might win some people over with that flo rida 
 *** 
 I'm ahead of this music game by light years 
 I'm the definition of swag bitch it's rite here 
 I'm gutta gutta just like YMsign? 
 I'm the sun in the summer, you can't outshine me 
 They not in my task records so I cannot mention it 
 Bitch look at my dashboard, I bet that bitch digital 
 They saying damn 
 So stuff get in they head 
 Pu-sy nigga I got the game locked just like a dread 
 He say he was harder? 
 I say he was flexin 
 I pull a VIP with 30 freaks and drop top lessons 
 Ain't a rapper and I will kill em 
 I'm 19 now 
 With 19 million 
 Back then it was all a dream 
 These days I'm feeling like martin luther king 
 Digital digital everything digital 
 Shorty check the dashboard in my lambo and it's digital 
 Digital digital everything digital 
 Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital 
 Digital digital everything digital 
 Digital digital everything digital 
 Shorty look at my dash and I bet that thing digital 
 Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital 
 Sh-t done need a rapper 
 I can bet a million 
 My chain change colors 
 I call it chameleon 
 Hurtin' niggas feelings 
 I'm in they mouth like fillings 
 I'm in the air chillin' 
 Right about a ceiling 
 I keep making hits 
 While you rappers stealing 
 I hustle 20 million 
 And I'm still dealing 
 Leather wood grippin 
 On a money mission 
 Got my paper flipping 
 Shoutout to my coalition 
 Niggas hatin' on me 
 But I gives a f-ck 
 Snakes in the grass 
 So I keep it cut 
 20 ace on the vehicle is grown up 
 Engine in my trunk 
 When I showed up 
 *** 
 'Cause I know they creepin' 
 Money is my language 
 Now speak it or seek it 
 You f-cking a white girl 
 *** 
 Call her girlfriends over 
 We watching them eat it 
 At the top of my game 
 Till they come defeat me 
 I'm on my may-weather sh-t 'cause I'm undefeated 
 It's me or my money 
 There's nothing in between it 
 And nigga I'm the best bitch and I f-cking mean it 
 Digital digital everything digital 
 Shorty check the dashboard in my lambo and it's digital 
 Digital digital everything digital 
 Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital 
 Digital digital everything digital 
 Digital digital everything digital 
 Shorty look at my dash and I bet that thing digital 
 Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital 
 On a money mission
