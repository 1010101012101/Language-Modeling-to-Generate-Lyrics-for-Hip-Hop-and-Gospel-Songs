 I'm tatted on my arm 
 It's a portrait on my neck 
 When I take my shirt off ya girl pussy get so wet 
 And my favorite color green 'cause I'm all about paper clean white beater lime green chuck tailors 
 Let it be known that I will x rate her 
 So many tattoos my arms inked in layers 
 I'm inked up I'm tatted (tatted)

 Step inside the club 
 She want the oj with the vodka 
 I made her pay for it cause my swag is super proper 
 I'm so icy as beezy 
 I make it look easy 
 This girl so boss 
 She trace my tattoos with her tongue uh

 Yeeea Bitch, you know what it is man 
 Paper plane gang, S.O.D, 
 You already know what it is 
 Yo bitch my hotel 
 Said ink my whole body I was for real 
 Now I get in whole sell 
 Say I can't get a job nigga o well 
 I'm smoking weed relaxin 
 Inked up like the checks I'm cashing 
 Whole neck tatted up, chest blasting 
 With a bad bitch blowing trees up 
 (I'm inked up I'm tattaed) 
 Couple goons that will let a nigga have it 
 Taylor Gang in their veins till the casket 
 What I rep you ain't even gotta ask
