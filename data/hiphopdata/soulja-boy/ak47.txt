AK47 (4x) Nigga 
 Bounce, bounce, bounce 
 Lay it down nigga 
 Boom, Boom, Boom 
 Clear the room (3x) 
 Nigga thought it was a game until he said he want to beef 
 I run inside yo momma house and shoot that bitch off in her teeth 
 I run inside yo sister house and shoot that bitch off in her feet 
 Fuck you and your whole street, Soulja Boy gone bring the heat 
 You bitch ass niggas know my name, I'm in that bentley fire flame 
 Pussy niggas SOD's nigga and nothings changed 
 But the fucking bank account, any any any amount 
 Nigga it's unlimited, I'm aiming while you're screaming bitch 
 It's Soulja tell 'em remenice about up in the younger day 
 Now I'm in the rouger way and niggas lookin' funny man 
 If you want the beef I'll pull the chopper and I'm stuntin mane 
 I'm flashing with the AK 
 Might fuck around, throw a grenade 
 Soulja Boy I'm so damn brave 
 I'm in that A, I'm on my street 
 Every street know me, isn't a street don't know me 
 Zone 1 to zone 4 to zone 6 is on me 
 Shout outs to Gucci, lets shoot this fuckin' movie 
 AK47 (4x) Nigga
