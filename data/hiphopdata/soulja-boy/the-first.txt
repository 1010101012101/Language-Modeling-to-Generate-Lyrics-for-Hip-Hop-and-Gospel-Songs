Hit me on my iPhone, boy I get my grind on 
 You just dropped a new hit, but why that sound like my song 
 Platinum plaques and marble floors when I cut my lights on 
 Nike gang checks everywhere, bitch soon as I ride on 
 First off let's get one thing straight 
 I'm smashin out farrari, fuckin' up the hand brake 
 The hentai on the kush got my lungs, its amazing 
 Just smoke a gold bar, roll up later and 
 I'm skating, just skating 
 Paper chasing, for my haters 
 I'm skating, just skating 
 Paper chasing, for my haters 
 Camo shorts, fresh as fuck with a purple T 
 Yellow diamond brightlin, it cost 200 Gs 
 It ain't to many people on the map ain't heard of me 
 When I step inside the club I be like 30 deep 
 I'm chillin', gold grillin 
 28 inches on it so I'm gettin' wit it 
 You know what I do, you know what I does 
 SOD money gang, go and throw it up 
 I'm chillin', we chillin' 
 Is you chillin', tell me how you feelin' 
 I'm chillin', we chillin' 
 Is you chillin', tell me how you feelin' 
 Every track I'm on, you know the kids straight mash it 
 Internationally known for rockin' all the latest fashions 
 VIP in the club, holding no glasses 
 And everyday I set a new trend for the masses 
 Super fresh swag, you know I go too in 
 She said she got two friends, you know I got to bend it 
 The SLR and AMG, I drop the top of the convertible 
 Now hate on me 
 Talkin' racks on racks, yeah that's that swag talk 
 Slow motion in the club, yeah that's that swag walk 
 A fine dime piece, yeah that's what that swag brought 
 A drop top bugatti parked on that asphalt 
 I'm chillin', gold grillin 
 28 inches on it so I'm gettin' wit it 
 You know what I do, you know what I does 
 SOD money gang, go and throw it up 
 I'm chillin', we chillin' 
 Is you chillin', tell me how you feelin' 
 I'm chillin', we chillin' 
 Is you chillin', tell me how you feelin'
