(Nicki Minaj) 
 Yo yo yo 
 Stop at the light imma jump out my Barbie dream car, 
 Imma jump on him, imma ride him like a theme park. 
 Family Guy 
 , let's have a little Stewie 
 Bust a you-ie, I forgot my Hewey, Dewey, Lewie. 
 Wedding green lam we call it watermelon, 
 I call him SB, he call me Nicki, tell 'em 
 I'm badder then a felon, he generous like Ellen. 
 Ain't talking hair products when I say that we gelling. 
 I'm the Barbie and he's the Ken, get my prenup then get my pen, 
 Get my floral girls and get my bride's maid, don't need 
 A gift little mama 'cause this bride's paid!
