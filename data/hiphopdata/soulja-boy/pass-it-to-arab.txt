Pass it to Arab (repeat) 
 Pass it to Arab, watch my feet and my hands 
 FiDDed cap on my head,.. on my pants 
 Shades on my face, 
 Rubber bands on my neck 
 Do yo dance in the club, 
 And you know that it's on deck 
 Do it, I did it, 
 When you see it you already know 
 Hit the merrygo, 
 Twist my body as I take it slow 
 Imma crank it up fo Soulja 
 Pass it on to me 
 Whatchu flinchin fo, 
 Cause you jumpin' off on BeaT 
 Yeah, I'm in this thang, 
 Check my chain, 
 Club got crunk when they heard 
 That your boy came 
 Man what you sayin' 
 I crank that Robocop 
 And make my shoulders drop 
 This snap (?) go by my socks? 
 Get low (get low), 
 Do it foe (do it foe) 
 Superman (superman), 
 Jig 'em foe (jig 'em foe) 
 Arab stacks on deck, 
 Read and write up on my teeth 
 Cross my feet, snap on beat, 
 I'll make that dance look lovely 
 I crank my bapes (I crank my bapes) 
 I crank my dance (I crank my dance) 
 If you gon hate (If you gon hate) 
 I crank these hands (I crank these hands) 
 Don't stop, do it 
 Pool palace, and shoot it 
 Oh, do yo dance 
 RoSeVeLt and pop yo pants 
 I did it, don't jock my dance 
 Watch me crank that kick the can 
 Throw it up in the air 
 And we finda catch it foe 
 17 years old 
 And took over the whole show 
 Uh, ah, Walk wit it now (repeat)
