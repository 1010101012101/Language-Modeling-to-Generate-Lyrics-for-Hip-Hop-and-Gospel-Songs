Drop head phantom 
 Human lame, diamonds dance 
 In a drop head phantom 
 I'm a soldier blessing for Tony Montana 
 Drop head 
 Drop head

 Suicide those 
 Let's take a toast 
 I made the most 
 I travel by the coast 
 I don't got a boat 
 I'm whippin' all over the stone 
 Shut out my plug 
 We on it 
 We on it 
 Pull up in a drop head, they know that we guap head 
 I'm running around with the check 
 Cuban link, water whip on my neck 
 Young soldier smokin' up on the jet 
 I'm feeling like DJ Khaled nigga we the best 
 I run through the city, I got a check 
 Standing on the yacht and I know that I'm rich 
 Rare ruby by the main wrist 
 Pistol and passport up on my hip 
 AP, diamond's dance 
 Oh, hard 3 D shine 
 Drop head phantom 
 Human lame, diamonds dance 
 In a drop head phantom 
 I'm a soldier blessing for Tony Montana 
 Soldier, soldier 
 Drop head

 These niggaz on me 
 I was far I got to Atlanta 
 No I'm a call him 
 But we got the club going up 
 No changing the channel 
 We hang up the banners 
 We winning, we winning 
 On the clouds we be surfin' 
 Bitches be under my surface 
 Hope you get no reception 
 You're out of service 
 Your nigga be rollin' 
 Guess he be lookin' for balls 
 But I'm lookin' for dollars 
 Young nigga don't got them 
 Send them home 
 Who a billionaire? 
 That's a true bitch weakness 
 We layin' on beaches 
 We playin' the game up in the bleaches 
 This is the score that you can't beat us 
 We takin' them trophies and having them speeches 
 Pick out the rings on our fingers 
 Drop head phantom 
 Human lame, diamonds dance 
 In a drop head phantom 
 I'm a soldier blessing for Tony Montana 
 Soldier, soldier 
 Drop head 
 Drop head 
 Drop head 
 Drop head 
 Drop head
