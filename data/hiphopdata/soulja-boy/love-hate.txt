 Verse One 
 18 Years Old like the muthafuckin trap 
 It's Soulja Boy Tell?em 
 Put my city on the map 
 Keep a pistol in my lap 
 As I ride through my projects 
 Because a nigga might try to rob me 
 Everyday I'm hustlin 
 No time for depression 
 I'm rich 
 But my whole family's in the damn recession 
 I learned my lesson so I will never slip 
 So I keep a gun in every room 
 Plus a pistol on my hip
