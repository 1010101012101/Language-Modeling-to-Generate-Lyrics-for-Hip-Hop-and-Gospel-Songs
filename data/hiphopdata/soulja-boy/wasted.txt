Ooh I'm wasted 
 Wasted, wasted, wasted 
 Lifesyle I won't make it

 Soulja tellem man higher than a hasion 
 And my eyez sat low like an asian 
 And my swag onnn, and I'm ridin' chrome 
 And I turned my swag on and I told yo girl 
 Kiss me through the damn phone

 And every single day, saying soulja I'm diamonds 
 My diams is shining and when I step on the stage

 Standing on the stage

 Oh! and we stepped inside the strip club 
 Then we throw some money, we just threw some numbers 
 They just threw the points putting out like pointers 
 And you already know Lamborghini pointers 
 Pay attention shawty, I'm the party 
 When I stepped inside the party

 When I walked outside the party, the club closed 
 When I stepped inside the ice show jewerly frozed

 Every nigga in the city, wanna get like me 
 And I can do this auto tune shit mane 
 Watch me sing, just like T-Pain 
 Ooh but I'm not Lil Wayne 
 But I'm tatted on my neck mane 
 And I'm higher than a jet mane 
 I mean I'm higher than a jet plane 
 Pay attention what I'm fuckin' saying

 But my hair not gold but my chain is gold 
 And my whole neck frozed
