Hey over there what's your name 
 Are you for real 
 Is this a game 
 You start to smile 
 And I do the same 
 I look away but you remain 
 Your eyes starin' back at me 
 My heart starts to skip a beat 
 I pray that you'll never know 
 I've fallen and you look in my eyes 
 You make me delirious 
 That's when I start to fall 
 Something serious 
 When you look in my eyes 
 You make me delirious 
 That's when I start to fall 
 Something serious 
 Now we're over here 
 And you're next to me 
 You look at me 
 I find it hard to speak 
 I start to laugh and you do the same 
 I look at you 
 You smile again 
 Your hand holdin' on to mine 
 The thoughts runnin' through my mind 
 I try not to let it show 
 I've fallen and you look in my eyes 
 You make me delirious 
 That's when I start to fall 
 Something serious 
 When you look in my eyes 
 You make me delirious 
 That's when I start to fall 
 Something serious 
 Your eyes starin' back at me 
 My heart starts to skip a beat 
 I pray that you'll never know 
 I've fallen and you look in my eyes 
 Your eyes starin' back at me 
 My heart starts to skip a beat 
 I pray that you'll never know 
 I've fallen and you look in my eyes 
 Tell me how you feel 
 I love it when you speak 
 Oh you so sweet 
 It was meant to be 
 While you're here with me 
 I wanna know you more 
 Hold you more 
 Kiss you till there's no more 
 Love the way you walk 
 Love it when you talk 
 My feelings so so deep 
 Every night I can't sleep 
 De-li-ri-ous from my head to my feet 
 De-li-ri-ous is what I can see 
 Something serious when it comes to you and me 
 You make me delirious 
 That's when I start to fall 
 Something serious 
 Something serious 
 Something serious 
 When you look in my eyes 
 You make me delirious 
 That's when I start to fall 
 Something serious
