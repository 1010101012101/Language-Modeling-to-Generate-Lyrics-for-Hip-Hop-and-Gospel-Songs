A-Rab man, I just got back from the mall, man 
 Guess what I get

 Man, I got me some bathin' apes

 Don't try to cop my style, man, stick to 'em Nike 
 Green, white, black inside these 
 Super clean bathin' apes 
 My shoes like my chain 
 Shine hard they might hurt ya face 
 I'm clean in this thang 
 B A P E S up on my feet 
 Fresh fade with the waves 
 30/30 boys up on my team 
 You wanna get 'em 
 But you can't get like me 
 Askin' me

 Step up on the stage with my mouth on froze 
 Bathin' apes on my feet, put the crowd on hold 
 Haters, see I'm on my feet, I know they get mad a lil' 
 A-Rab rockin' more colors then a bag of skittles
