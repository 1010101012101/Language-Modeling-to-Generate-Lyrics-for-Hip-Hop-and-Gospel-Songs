Soulja boy: 
 (Talking) 
 Ester dean 
 What do you want from me 
 Because I've giving you everything 
 What do you need from me 
 Are you not happy with anything 
 Soulja Boy 
 Party like a rockstar 
 Hit 'em with the hot bars 
 Fast like a nascar 
 Lyin' like my dash car 
 I deserve a grammy 
 Will I fly away or land on Miami 
 I don't have time to rhyme 
 But I do have time to grind 
 SOD pirates I don't need a hook 
 My lyrics illustrated versus takin' from a book 
 I understand the fans 
 Supply and demand 
 Crunk and command 
 Fight nd we'll stand 
 Lyrics from a true legend 
 Live a life to god blessings 
 Big papers long acres 
 Top flight no security 
 Black ice on me call a jury 
 Yah trick yah and we call it magic 
 My style may change you can call it drastic 
 Money so long ????? measures 
 I love my business and I love my pleasure 
 Live now dies later Internet genius 
 Self proclaimin he critically acclaimed for the fortunate of fame 
 He'll run through the rain 
 For a meanin' to change 
 Taking over the game 
 18 years old wid a drop top phantom 
 Kidnap the world till they pay my ransom 
 Deandre way look what tatted on my face 
 4 words 2 say 
 I deserve a grammy 
 Ester dean 
 What do you want from me 
 'Cause I've giving you everything 
 What do you need from me 
 Are you not happy with anything 
 Is it not good enough 
 Am I not good enough 
 Have I not gave enough 
 What do you want from me (2x)
