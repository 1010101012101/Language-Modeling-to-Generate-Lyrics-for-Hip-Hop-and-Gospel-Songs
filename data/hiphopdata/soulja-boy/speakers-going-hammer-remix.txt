I wake up early in the morning, 
 Hop up in them throne and 
 Wave to them haters like, what's up? (Say, What's up?) 
 See, you might have to yell, 
 'Cause my music's loud as hell, 
 And I can't hear nothing over my drum 
 Because I got the speakers going hammer 
 (Bammer Bammer Bammer) 
 Speakers going hammer 
 (Bammer Bammer Bammer) 
 Speakers going hammer 
 (Bammer Bammer Bammer) 
 Speakers going hammer 
 (Bammer Bammer Bammer) 
 Speakers going hammer, (hammer), bammer, (bammer) boom 
 Red and black Bugatti, vroom, zoom (zoom, zoom), 
 I be rollin' round town makin' noise, 
 That Chopped 'n' Screwed music 
 (Comin' down on them boys) 
 Eh eh eh eh, 
 I got a dump 
 And you don't wanna see what's goin' on in that trunk 
 (What's in the trunk?) 
 A couple speakers, and that chopper 
 Make it proper, when them coppers 
 Wanna stop her, In a locker 
 Until they see all them poppers in the backseat 
 (Is them your hoes?) 
 Guess I'm goin' (?????????????) 
 (Iz you puttin' that vase in they toes?) 
 Bitch, You know I am! (Yes, I am) 
 Struttin' as I have it 
 Bitch, I gotta have it 
 The parking lot shut down every time I pass it 
 And every time I blast it 
 He check his space 
 White people lookin' at me like, Smh 
 So, get your cake up (cake up) 
 And when I pass by your ass pick your face up 
 Because (I wake up) 
 I wake up early in the morning, 
 Hop up in them throne and 
 Wave to them haters like, what's up? 
 See, you might have to yell, 
 'Cause my music's loud as hell, 
 And I can't hear nothing over my drum 
 Because I got the speakers going hammer 
 (Bammer Bammer Bammer) 
 Speakers going hammer 
 (Bammer Bammer Bammer) 
 Speakers going hammer 
 (Bammer Bammer Bammer) 
 Speakers going hammer 
 (Bammer Bammer Bammer) 
 I remember back in the days man I were broke 
 These days Soulja tell 'em run a hundred spokez 
 No joke, mayne I'm balling out the atmosphere 
 Say you ball harder then me, man get 'em outta here 
 I gotta my speakers going hamm in my Lamborghini 
 Two door coupe, girl in bikini 
 Passenger seat and she five star she so swagg 
 She so fabolous they way she throw it in the bag 
 Its young Soulja Tell 'em mane I swear I'm popping tags 
 Back then, u could catch me in a poniac 
 These days droptop phantom with a 100 stackz 
 Yeah they buy this album but they want they money back 
 Girls wet like they living in a fish tank 
 I'm getting money man, what the fuck a bitch think 
 Young Soulja got my speakers going MC Hammer 
 Like Rick Ross bitch I think I'm MC Hammer 
 I wake up early in the morning, 
 Round the crack of dawning 
 Wave to my neighbors like wassup (say wassupp) 
 And I'm tatted up, dat bang in my trunk 
 Everybody in ma city show me love 
 Because I got ma speakers going hammer, 
 (Bammer bammer bammer) 
 Speakers going hammer, 
 (Speakers going hammer?) 
 Speakers going hammer, 
 (Bammer bammer bammer) 
 Speakers going hammer, 
 (Bpeakers going hammer?)
