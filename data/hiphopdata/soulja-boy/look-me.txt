 Dey start to dance even when dey hear da ring tone 
 Now you can look at me

 It's d.h.b stupid read da name across my patnaz chest 
 Dey hatin' so hard and they do wanna stop it 
 But dey can't do it so all dey do is copy 
 My name on my shades so its fame on my frames

 Den ima crank dat shootout and let my hands blast 
 Den ima switch it up and crank da roosevelt 
 And pool palace to da flo like nobody else 
 And now dey askin me how you dat dance
