Soulja boy tellem (tellem) 
 I'm in the nightmares like that nigga freddy couger 
 Put you in the torture axe, straight lex lugar 
 Any fuckin' shootout, bitch I'm the shooter 
 Soulja boys a winner, never ever been a loser 
 They blowin' up my phone, soulja boy we need a feature 
 Hands up at my shows, like my fans are wide receivers 
 Your girl mouth packed full of nuts like a snicker 
 That bitch was so hungry, you know I had to feed her 
 You wasn't hittin it right so hell ya I had to beat her 
 She said you like to eat her, but I like to mistreat her 
 I knew I was gon fuck when she gave me her number 
 Beatin' on the pussy like a rockstar drummer 
 I done came up 
 They say that I done change but one thing remain the same is SOD money gang 
 They say that I done changed, I got the money and the fame as SOD money gang 
 They say that I don't change but one thing remain the same is SOD money gang (done came up) 
 They say that I done change but one thing remain the same is SOD money gang 
 I made it rain like hell and I struck like lightning 
 You would think I was bone the way these niggas keep biting 
 Soulja boy tellem fresher in bandana ties 
 Slice these niggas neck like I'm a muthafuckin samurai 
 You make it look easy, I make it look easier 
 People lookin' at my jewelry, start havin' a seizure 
 This is how I got her, she chose me of my necklace 
 She fucked me up for dinner, and she sucked me up for breakfast 
 Y'all get crunk, but we get crunkest 
 Y'all get drunk, but we get drunkest 
 Drop top lamborghini same color same kicks 
 While I'm out here stuntin, y'all keep doin' dumb shit 
 I done came up 
 They say that I done change but one thing remain the same is SOD money gang 
 They say that I done changed, I got the money and the fame as SOD money gang 
 They say that I don't change but one thing remain the same is SOD money gang (done came up) 
 They say that I done change but one thing remain the same is SOD money gang 
 Money on my mind, 'cause that's all I know 
 Money on my mind, 'cause that's all I blow 
 Tellem kiss my ass, 'cause that's all I show 
 My favorite color purple bcuz that's all I smoke 
 I'm lookin' for the money, I'm searchin, I'm huntin 
 If she ain't wanna fuck why the fuck is she come then 
 Her pussy and my paint got the same thing in common 
 Bcuz they both wet like rainin and thunderin 
 S.Beezy swag, new true religion 
 I got so many bars I can build a fuckin' prison 
 Soulja swag all out, this place is three-dimensional 
 I got my own language fuck basics comprehension 
 I done came up 
 They say I done change but one thing remain the same is SOD money gang
