Soulja Boy Tellem 
 The dance floor silly 
 The ladies gon feel me 
 The fellas in the back and they twissin up a philly 
 Get silly (8x) 
 The dance floor silly 
 The ladies gon feel me 
 The fellas in the back and they twissin up a philly 
 (2x) 
 My chain too silly 
 My wrist too silly 
 The girls throw me dish 'cause my rims big billin 
 My ride too sill 
 I ride too silly 
 We for fantastic 'cause I got a deally 
 'Cause now I'm I'm worth a milly 
 Forget a rubberband 'cause you can't put a rubberband around a millian 
 I be wildin on a island somewhere just like gilligan 
 Drillin hood like a dentist at the den like villerann 
 I ba ba ba I'm da man girlfriend 
 I'm da reason why you wanna lose ya man girlfriend 
 I'm calm like da sea 
 I'm blowed like the wind 
 And now that I'm straight I'm bout to act a fool again 
 Get silly (8x) 
 The dance floor silly 
 The ladies gon feel me 
 The fellas in the back and they twissin up a philly 
 (2x) 
 My shades too silly 'cause they made by cavalli 
 Jays so exotic you can't find 'em lil buddy 
 I'm not nick cannon but I'm wildin out clubbin 
 Watchin everybody jockin while I'm poppin' sumthin bubbly 
 Poppin' sumthin bubbly 
 I'm tryna do it big 
 Da boy from the A 
 I'm tryna represent 
 Dem hater in my way 
 I play this game to win 
 Watch me take 'em to the ally knock 'em all off like some pins 
 When I drop drop drop imma sell like silly 
 'Cause ev'rybody dancin and everybody feel me 
 With stacks in my jeans just like my name was billy 
 While I'm jockin on you haters 
 Just like a pop-a-wheelie 
 Get silly (8x) 
 The dance floor silly 
 The ladies gon feel me 
 The fellas in the back and they twissin up a philly 
 (2x) 
 Get silly (8x)
