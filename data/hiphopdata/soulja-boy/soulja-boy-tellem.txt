Soulja Boy Tell 'Em 
 Wake up out my sleep it's time to start another day 
 Soulja Boy how many albums did you go and sell today? 
 Boy Tell 'Em 
 SBeezy the truth is what I'm tellin' 
 Got this clown dissin' me, but where is his album sellin'? 
 Boy Tell 'Em 
 I'm doin' interviews addressin' all these critics 
 Tryna underrate me sayin' I ain't got no lyrics 
 Boy Tell 'Em 
 Three times platinum yeah I broke the record 
 If you can't respect that tell me what is you respectin' 
 Dudes rockin' yums fades 'cause Soulja Boy Tell 'Em 
 Blowin' off they Myspace page 'cause Soulja Boy Tell 'Em 
 Got 'em yellin' out the A 
 ('Cause Soulja Boy Tell 'Em) 
 Reppin' S.O.D.money gang 'cause Soulja Boy Tell 'Em 
 The superman what they crank 'cause Soulja Boy Tell 'Em 
 They got they names on they shades

 Boy Tell 'Em 
 Boy I spit harder I spit fire 
 We tell them old washed up rappers to retire 
 Boy Tell 'Em 
 Tryna copy my technique on your album 
 It's time to crank it up let's turn up the volume 
 The rap game don't get me started 
 My lyrics get recycled but your lyrics just garbage 
 Boy Tell 'Em 
 For you to get a hit you need a feature 
 I'm solo every track still comin' out yo speakers
