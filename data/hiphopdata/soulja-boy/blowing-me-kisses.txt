Yeah, I said this one for your stereo 
 Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, turn me 
 Yeah, yeah, I say-say this one for your stereo 
 Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up 
 Shout out sexy ladies, this right here is your song 
 Hop inside your car and turn your radio on 
 Shout out sexy ladies, this right here is your song 
 Hop inside your car and turn your radio on 
 She blowing me kisses, she blowing me kisses 
 I'm sitting and reminiscing, thinking, dreaming 
 She blowing me kisses, she blowing me kisses 
 I'm sitting and reminiscing, thinking, dreaming 
 About us 
 I can take you places-places you have never been 
 Caribbean, feet in the sand 
 I-I can take you around the world 
 And you can be my girl, and I can buy you pearls 
 And you can tell your girlfriends, how I put it down 
 And it's like a movie every time I come around 
 When I'm in your city, man I shut the town down 
 Tell the whole world that I'm hot right now 
 Shout out sexy ladies, this right here is your song 
 Hop inside your car and turn your radio on 
 Shout out sexy ladies, this right here is your song 
 Hop inside your car and turn your radio on 
 She blowing me kisses, she blowing me kisses 
 I'm sitting and reminiscing, thinking, dreaming 
 She blowing me kisses, she blowing me kisses 
 I'm sitting and reminiscing, thinking, dreaming 
 About us 
 Yeah 
 She like me, I like her 
 Knew-knew I would've wifed her 
 Who would've thought that, she would've been like 
 The other half of me, what a sight to see 
 Me and her traveling, all across the world 
 I can be her man, she can be my girl 
 Turn the radio on, she kissing me through the phone 
 When sing her a song, when I tell it's on 
 Shout out sexy ladies, this right here is your song 
 Hop inside your car and turn your radio on 
 Shout out sexy ladies, this right here is your song 
 Hop inside your car, and turn your radio on 
 She blowing me kisses, she blowing me kisses, 
 I'm sitting and reminiscing, thinking, dreaming, 
 She blowing me kisses, she blowing me kisses, 
 I'm sitting and reminiscing, thinking, dreaming 
 About us, about us
