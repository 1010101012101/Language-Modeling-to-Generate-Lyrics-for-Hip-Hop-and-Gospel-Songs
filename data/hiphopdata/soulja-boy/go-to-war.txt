 Y'all pay attention ta dis I'ma show y'all some real shit right now 
 3:30 in tha mornin I'm in my house chillin' 
 Niggaz kicked in my side doe 
 And started runnin' threw da kitchen 
 I peeped out tha doe, seen a nigga wit a K 
 Dressed in all black wit a ski mask on his face 
 So I bussed out tha doe, started shootin at that bitch 
 And tha 1st bullet missed, but tha next 5 hit 
 So I cut tha lights off, then I crouched down ta da ground 
 Took a look at Arab, said "nigga don't make a sound!" 
 Had my pistol in my hand so I knew I had tha power 
 Heard footsteps gettin' louuder and louuder 
 I ran out tha doe, started bussin wit my 9 
 6 bullets left tha clip, but 5 on me hit his spine 
 Now he layin on tha ground, screamin like a hoe 
 He thought his homeboys was real, but they ran out tha doe 
 Now he lyin' on tha flo, screamin like a lil bitch 
 When I shot him he dropped his pistol now hee ain't got shit 
 I told Arab, "go and take a look around da place." 
 Den I walked up ta dis nigga, snatched dat mask off his face 
 After I saw who it was, itz a face I couldn't forget 
 I can't believe deez niggaz came and tried ta rob me fa my shit 
 After all I did fa y'all, this tha fuckin' thanks I get 
 Tried ta take ya out tha hood and tried ta make you niggaz rich 
 So dey kicked in my doe and tried ta jack me fa my shit 
 Y'all niggaz ain't got no heart, thatz some real foul shit 
 So I sit back taday and I thank inside my head
