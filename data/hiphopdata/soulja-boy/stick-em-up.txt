 Soulja boy tellem 
 Kabooom!(pow pow) 
 I blow up like a bomb 
 I'm so hot they compare me to the sun 
 You can diss me but I really think you shouldn't 
 Ozzy with banana clips just make banana pudding 
 They wanna ask me questiions, the money is the answer 
 My flow so cold like I was born in Alaska 
 Soulja ain't got swag what the fuck is you thinking 
 Tattoos on point like the tip of an ink pen... bitch

 Soulja boy tellem 
 Rolling through my neighborhood candy paint on fishbowls 
 All of my genies throwing up them fuckin' pitch forks 
 Soulja boy tellem ima young gun dolla 
 When I'm in chicago rollin' we got farther 
 A couple zones of purp I gotta get my high on 
 Since me and dollar closed on my fuckin' iphone 
 If I don't make shit ima make money 
 If you don't get it to me ima take it from you... pussy
