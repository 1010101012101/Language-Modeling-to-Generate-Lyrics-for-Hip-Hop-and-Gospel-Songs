We count stacks over here 
 Two week talk, AK 47 you for real wit the stoke 
 I'm on deck (I'm on deck) [x4]

 We stay crunk over here mayne a whole sick crunk 
 Some niggas got the hustling in the corner like a punk 
 Some niggas I can't trust them 'cause I got my pocket loaded 
 Stole all my work, went to the block and then sold it 
 My favorite color blue but my pocket green loaded 
 And when I'm on my girl can't forget about children 
 Got the big girl stiches got me swimming in the ocean 
 Make money on their knees 
 Gettin' over say I told ya 
 Gettin' violated 
 I got a freezer then you frozen, and you can heavyweight 
 I got a team that can make you a heart-trick 
 I got some rims that spun and if you talk it down I got a nigga that will choke ya

 Get your back thrown up like for a black lash 
 Disrespect like you about to get dragged 
 Stay true to the livin' state next to Alabama (VA) 
 Shawty hear the snap song so now I'm on the camera 
 She ain't heard about the boy you call hoe 
 Asking about her shawty saying that you can't go 
 My aunt gotta go or else I'm a real nigga 
 I'm about this money so just call me gold digger 
 You see us in the club throwing up that black bandana 
 You know us high head so you don't wanna battle 
 If you bout that action then talk about the phantom 
 'Cause I do your brains like I making money rain (HAHA)

 Now let me drop a few verses 'cause I rap I don't sing 
 You can see me in the streets making money do my thang 
 Got a crib with my boys, just watch ill entertain 
 Got about 50 songs and ill send you to the game 
 And I try to keep my head up but I'm going through this phase 
 Keep trusting all these niggas and I feel it's a shame 
 I pout shedding into tears 
 It's a river like nice wet rain 
 I blunt with my nigga, took me down in memory lane 
 15 years old with a brains of a old man 
 Can't teach me of the talk 'cause I'll be the same 
 My niggas got they head high 'cause they feeling for my pain 
 I know you see me when I die but in a week it's going down
