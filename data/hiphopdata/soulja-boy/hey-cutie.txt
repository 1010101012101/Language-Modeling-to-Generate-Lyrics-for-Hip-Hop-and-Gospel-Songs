Supersexy 
 Girl I believe you can fly 
 But you have to spread your wings 
 Tell her I'm gonna take my... 
 Shorty wanna know if this is true 
 That I'm gonna do what it do with her 
 Get unpredictable 
 DJ won't you gonna play this song I love so 
 Get ready like 
 I like how you move 
 Get out of life 
 I had to wait 
 Zip it while we tell her 
 She's supersexy 
 It takes no one to tell me why 
 I can't keep you off my head 
 Listen baby 
 You don't need to be in a magazine 
 Listen baby 
 You're the one... me 
 Super sexy 
 You are good to me 
 Model 
 Rescue me 
 Super sexy 
 You make me safe 
 Come and rescue me [repeats]
