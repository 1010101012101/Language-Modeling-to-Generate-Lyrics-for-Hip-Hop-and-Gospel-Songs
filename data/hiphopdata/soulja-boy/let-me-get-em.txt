 Its time to do my dance 
 Pullin up my pants 
 Posted on the dancefloor 
 In my pimpin' stance 
 It ain't the same thing 
 Do my dance it's a stinger 
 You gotta rock smooth 
 Then you pull yo trigger finger 
 Going wild on da dance floor 
 Yeah I got fans 
 I'm doing the pool palace 
 And they looking at my hands 
 I'm bout to do my dance 
 But naw you can't stop that 
 I crank my dance up then I let my glock cock back
