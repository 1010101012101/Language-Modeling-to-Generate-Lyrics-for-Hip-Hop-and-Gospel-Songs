Stop snap then wiggle wit it snap 
 Stop snap then wiggle wit it snap 
 Stop snap then wiggle wit it snap 
 Stop snap 'cause soulja boy told ya 
 (8 x's) 
 Do the motorcycle snap 
 Posted at tha store me and my folk 
 Buddy talkin' crazy but he jus don't know 
 Gipp in the building and we screamin out we up 
 They ain't got no money sh** gettem outta her 
 First side hype I'm on top of the charts 
 Charts hit the finish line for a playa in the start 
 Still on the scene still holdin' green 
 And ya know we can meet if ya boi disagree 
 I got eyes in the streets so I know who be talkin' 
 Half of the nights soulja boi sleep walkin' 
 Patrone but I'm grown so I stay on that ex 
 I stay wit a black fitted cap on my head 
 I'm always ridin' always surprisin 
 Summer time hit and I'm goin' to that island 
 I'm jus grindin it's me bein me 
 Don't get served but you heard in the streets 
 I got money on my mind 
 Mind on my money 
 I see them laughin' but it ain't nuttin funny 
 I'm gettin' out the work tryna stash 6 0 
 They know who I b 'cause my name on my clothes 
 Hat to the back already on my stand 
 Soulja boy gon do the dance 
 First ya snap then wiggle then rock 
 Hit the motorcycle then stop
