She like the way I lean, you know I had to do it 
 Shawty she so fine, man my game is stupid, stupid, stupid 
 DJ run that music 
 I can read her mind, and she's about to lose it, loose it, loose it 
 She's about to lose it, 
 Shawty so fine, man my game is stupid, stupid, stupid 
 DJ run that music 
 I can read her mind, and she's about to lose it 
 G-Got her nickname on her necklace that's a go 
 I love the way her polish make her nails look like they glow 
 I-I-I can tell she fly when she ain't got nowhere to go 
 She keep that hair and make up like she starin' in a show 
 Wanna see what she got on this here party though 
 We gettin' turnt up on the floor 
 She will knock me on the low, 
 To bad pretty girls don't dance no more 
 When the home girls say gon' girl 
 I know she will be rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' 
 She like the way I lean, you know I have to do it 
 Shawty she so fine, man my game is stupid, stupid, stupid 
 DJ run that music 
 I can read her mind, and she's about to lose it, loose it, loose it 
 She's about to lose it, 
 Strategy so fine, man my game is stupid, stupid, stupid 
 DJ run that music 
 I can read her mind, and she's about to lose it 
 Shawty so fine, one of a kind 
 Looking so sexy, always on my mind 
 Shawty so turnt up, turn and drop it 
 I wanna see you move it, turn around and pop it 
 B-B-B-Baby put her technique on display 
 She do it like she practice in the mirror everyday 
 You know she's got to feel it when she flip away her bangs 
 All her girls giggle, but the homies be like dang 
 R-R-Run it back, run it back one more time that's what's up 
 Talk real talk, now back it up 
 Rep yo city, here give it 
 Lights off, lights on, we switchin' up 
 Bounce to the left side, to the right side 
 She drop it, then she roll it, roll it, roll it, roll it 
 She like the way I lean, you know I have to do it 
 Shawty she so fine, man my game is stupid, stupid, stupid 
 DJ run that music 
 I can read her mind, and she's about to lose it, loose it, loose it 
 She's about to lose it, 
 Strategy so fine, man my game is stupid, stupid, stupid 
 DJ run that music 
 I can read her mind, and she's about to lose it
