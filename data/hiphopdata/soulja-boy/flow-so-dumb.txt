 My life feel like I'm starin' in a soap opera 
 Niggaz say beezy dats a dope watch bruh 
 Sunday night count creek red lobster

 Flo fantastic my money bounce call it cash elastic 
 A monster, a beast, a creature, a vulture

 Uuummm listen to da drum go bum 
 Most of rappers spit bubble gum yum 
 My watch dumb wat have I become 
 Become I am da reason 
 Dis a test not da real song it looks good but feel so wrong 
 Da paparazzo caught me takin' a shit

 And I heard he couldn't cut a check for the real dealer
