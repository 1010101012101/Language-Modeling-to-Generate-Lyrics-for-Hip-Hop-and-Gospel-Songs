Ay bra dis soulja boy just churp me when you get dis. 
 So I'm ridin' through da hood 100k make my neck swell 
 If I ain't at home you can churp me on da nextel 
 Maceo done told me don't talk about da work. 
 'Cause undercover in da hood diggin up dirt. 
 Still gettin' money yeah pockets on swole 
 Police tryna give me 10 years without wit out parole 
 They say I'm gettin' money but they say it ain't da right way 
 5 or 6 cars wit a bike in da driveway 
 Sittin' in da spotlight chain start blinging 
 Step up da car and my phone start ringin' 
 Shawty who it be soulja boy above da law 
 If he owe money don't pay it back I break his jaw 
 He stay churpin da phone say soulja you da man do 
 Ahead of da game you can call me commando 
 Black ss wit da suicide doors 
 Platinum earing rangs and da icy clean clothes
