I feel good everyday on ... work dough 
 Soldier boy hell, yeah, I got that work dough 
 Workaholic shawty yellow diamondz studio 
 I'm everyday working hard in the studio 
 Hater clock in I'm on it 
 No yawn, all I'm thinkin' bout is making money and that new performance 
 Think my fans tell them people that don't get the paper 
 Until my haters listening to them ... can hate me later 
 Yeah, tell those dudes that they can hate me later 
 Cause ... line the paper 
 There is no thing that you can do to stop my ... power 
 So all of you cowards, please get devoured 
 Hate me later, hate me later, hate me later, later, later, later, later.
