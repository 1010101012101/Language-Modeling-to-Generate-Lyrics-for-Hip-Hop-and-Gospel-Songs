Met her at a rave, never stopped grooving 
 Lost in a trance from telepopmusic 
 I was so gone, she was so there 
 I know I'm intoxicated but I don't care 
 Lights keep flashing, she keeps dancing 
 She's trying to figure out why I keep glancing 
 This is my chance, I don't wanna miss it 
 Eye contact, something feels different 
 Two new worlds, our galaxy is distant 
 I send my radiation, she started drifting 
 Teleport her over my way that instant 
 Grabbed, leaned in her ear and whispered 
 If your too high and you can't listen 
 Tune in to the new transmission 
 Step out of life and make the transition 
 She's so high, she reach the sky 
 Look into her eyes, she's so high 
 She lives inside of clouds, her silence is loud 
 She screams without a sound she's so profound 
 Left from the rave, hopped in a spaceship 
 Off to the hard drive, west of the matrix 
 I was so high, didn't think I could make it 
 Plus I kept envisioning the woman I was taking home 
 Getting naked (clothes), baby take it (slow), ain't no way we gotta (go), I lay in my all pink UFO, land on a lily pad then we (coast), pour some? champagne and (toast), the bubbles from the champagne make us (float), aquatic clouds now we both need a (moat), she's the high I need the most 
 More than a woman, less than a queen, stuck in between 
 Reality and dreams 
 This feels like a movie scene, she's holographic without the screen, nah mean? 
 She's so high, she reach the sky 
 Look into her eyes, she's so high 
 She lives inside of clouds, her silence is loud 
 She screams without a sound she's so profound
