I'm an uptown boy with Soho flava 
 The beat is D minor but I'm oh so major 
 I do my own thing so I owe no favors 
 Can't do it now then I won't go later 
 Haters wanna see the boy get lost in the sauce 
 But it's gravy so boy get lost 
 Nah I ain't cocky I'm just statin the obvious 
 H.O. the boss and I'm makin' his pockets rich 
 Hated or not I am great and about to get greater 
 Hit the paper like the boy was clay olkovich 
 I keep it real and my ladies do the same 
 High class chicks that be crazy in the brain 
 Style so mean swag is vicious 
 Smile O.D. as delicious 
 Stay gettin' money no need for ebay 
 My heart is all world but I'm lovin' BK 
 I ain't got no problems with girls out in Harlem but 
 They ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 See I had a dope fling with a girl out in queens but 
 They ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 The Bronx is live that's where my mom resides but 
 They ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 Damn sure ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 Damn sure ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 My girl Angie can't be a groupie or whore 
 She bout getting money in her juicy couture 
 Do she get bored with the Gucci of course 
 So the Louis she sports till it ain't new anymore 
 Then she cop another one makin' hoes gettin' madder 
 Gettin' more money so the price don't matter 
 Ain't seen her in a minute know her ass got fatter 
 And if you think she bad than her friends are way badder 
 Kenja's a christian never seen freakin 
 In church every weekend she need to be a deacon 
 Had a model bitch Vida we ain't speakin' 
 But I had her screamin whenever I was beatin' 
 She been callin, creepin', crawlin 
 Maybe she would chill if I would beat it off 
 Then Ronesha's fly and she sweeter than splenda 
 Cause no one ever slows her agenda 
 I ain't got no problems with girls out in Harlem but 
 They ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 See I had a dope fling with a girl out in queens but 
 They ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 The Bronx is live that's where my mom resides but 
 They ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 Damn sure ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 Damn sure ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 And sweet smoke da la la la 
 BK gettin' money no 9-5 
 Mama sing mama sa mu makusa 
 I don't make sense but admit it, it's kinda hot 
 BK girls down with that ride or die 
 So I always keep one right by my side 
 See I love New York I ain't gotta lie 
 So if you messin with my ladies it's homicide 
 I gotta friend named Shayna 
 She like Bill Bellamy and how to be a player 
 Shorty is a player can't nobody play her 
 Can't nobody game her 'cause she ain't a gamer 
 Babygirl a baller kinda like the Lakers 
 If you would treat her like Shaq then see ya later 
 Player she do it so easy it's kinda like a layup 
 She could lay up with your boy with no make up 
 Keep doin' her an I'm a keep doin' me 
 Even on the road I'm a keep 2 or 3 
 Bad BK chicks that speak fluently 
 In the Hamilton language girl speak to me please 
 I remember when I could'nt get a girl for shit 
 Now I can't get rid of any girl for shit 
 So when they look at me I don't look away 
 I spread love it's the brooklyn way 
 Now let the hook play 
 I ain't got no problems with girls out in Harlem but 
 They ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 See I had a dope fling with a girl out in queens but 
 They ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 The Bronx is live that's where my mom resides but 
 They ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 Damn sure ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 Damn sure ain't nuttin like a Brooklyn girl 
 There ain't nuttin like a brooklyn girl [x3] 
 There sure ain't nuttin like them brooklyn girls [x2]
