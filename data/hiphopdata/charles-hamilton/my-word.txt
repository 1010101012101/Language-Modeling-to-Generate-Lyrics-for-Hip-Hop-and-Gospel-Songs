If my world once should be tarnished 
 And all my words were garbage 
 Would you ever take a promise from me 
 If the world was just a fable 
 Our lives were on a table 
 Do you think that you'd be able to see 
 I live life to the fullest 
 My mind is a WMD 
 Fuck a knife or a bullet 
 My soul is a grenade pin 
 I'm likely to pull it 
 Grown up they always told me play nicely 
 I couldn't 
 Never good in groups I was born to be a leader 
 You hear me loud and clear like I was born to be a speaker 
 The industry's a slut 
 Get up on and you could see her 
 I walk through war zones I wore right through my sneakers 
 The demon seed from heaven 
 I promised them hell 
 You don't want war with me 
 I'm Donald Rumsfeld 
 Everybody's a race Black and White 
 Well my race is pink so 
 This track is right 
 And this beat here was made by Black aight 
 No race relations just rappin' right 
 You ain't rappin' right 
 You just rappin' right 
 Tryin' to get your actin' right 
 Just rap aight 
 See this world is mine I beat the devil in pinball 
 No bat mask and my message is get lost 
 Play it back and you get the same shit 
 But play it back and you won't get the same shit... nigga 
 If my world once should be tarnished 
 And all my words were garbage 
 Would you ever take a promise from me 
 If the world was just a fable 
 Our lives were on a table 
 Do you think that you'd be able to see 
 The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled 
 Is the exact same trick that the treble ever pulled 
 Ming niggas think that bass is cool 
 The best way you could ever face a fool 
 Give him a little bass the think it's dope 
 Next thing you know they gonna drink the potion 
 But this is Pink Magic no need to inject it 
 Just put it in your ears you need to respect it 
 See my my only fear is being rejected 
 Only real fear is fear you know me being reckless 
 Don't believe me you'll believe in a second 
 Speak through the wind so the breeze is my Lexus 
 So when I say that I fuckin' breeze in a Lexus 
 It's more than just a lie 
 Believe and accept it 
 Y'all niggas ain't sick you a measly infection 
 I'm a genetic curse perfectly and perfected 
 I fuck an angel that can turn into a beast when he's tested 
 Eat through the flesh and proceed to the next king 
 My kingdom has come your dynasty has to exit 
 Your just lookin' bleak I ain't bein a pestis 
 The genius the best kid 
 Mr. Miyagi my B-Day is everyday no getting me bodied 
 Ring the alarm the color pink is a charm 
 And I'll be damned if I ain't got the world singing my song 
 If my world once should be tarnished 
 And all my words were garbage 
 Would you ever take a promise from me 
 If the world was just a fable 
 Our lives were on a table 
 Do you think that you'd be able to see 
 I go in 
 Never stop flowin 
 So ma blow in 
 Like Chicago wind 
 Everybody actin' like they know me and shit 
 I tell them cut it out like Uncle Joey and shit 
 Bitches plottin Charles you know you owe me for this 
 I don't owe you for shit 
 O blow on some dick 
 That's why I keep to myself 
 Because I'm Close to bein rich 
 And they know this shit so they lookin' for a way 
 Lookin' for a day that's why I disappear 
 Stay out in Brooklyn for a day 
 With a Brooklyn Girl 
 She keep it real with a nigga but my Harlem girl 
 Know how to deal with a nigga 
 I'm God's soldier boy 
 God is a Woman when she on her period 
 She wanna feel with a nigga 
 Somethin' about that time of the month 
 That get it sensitive she get mad 
 And take it out on my penmanship 
 But she late on my birthday 
 She pregnant immaculate conception 
 Dig this shit if it is what it is I live this shit 
 Dropped outta H.S. so the kid is it 
 H.O. is Morpheus you show me what the system is 
 Charles Hamilton I'll show you what the business is bitches
