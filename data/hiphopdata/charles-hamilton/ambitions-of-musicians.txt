Live today like tomorrow homie just earn money 
 Hip-pop ain't die man it just turned 20 
 Ambitions of musicians of Tholonius Monk 
 Mixed with a lil punk for the homies to bump 
 I am not a lil punk for the homies to jump 
 Scarface smokin' blunts, while I'm holdin' the pump 
 So many hoes know me, I know what they want 
 But I'm bobby at night, so I choke her for fun 
 Better yet, spreewell when I'm chokin' the coach 
 You know, that the flow is dope, so don't even front 
 You better say that I'm the truth, when I open my mouth 
 I'm a ghost, that's why I got so many styles 
 Nigga pac won't leave me alone, he keep hauntin' me, tauntin' me, I ask him what the hell you want from me? 
 He said "nothin' I just need some new company, these other rappers still soundin' kind of dumb to me" 
 So don't be scared if ever you think I grab at ya, I know it's creepy so what "I AIN'T MAD AT YA" 
 This is written but off the top I'm the mad hatter, a bad boy, no wonder I see the mad rappers 
 All I gotta do is spray 'em with mase, they just pimples, I'm noxema, they won't stay in my face 
 They got a lot of opinions they won't say to my face 
 I treat 'em like Bush do Mexicans, stay in your place 
 I'm pink so why would I stay in a race 
 But I black and these niggas can't stay in the race 
 I'm a beast, catch me bathin' with apes, ridin' with lions, why are you lyin' playa you gay 
 If you try to throw me a curve I'm makin' it straight, shorty try to throw me her curves man I stay gettin' laid 
 I'm a cute pink carpet, I stay in her place 
 And graffiti with the semen when I spray in her face 
 Using racial terms, I'm the ace of the spades, loon of the coons, more money for the porch monkeys 
 I stack figures, translation, I'm dat nigga, rap sicka then all of you rap niggas 
 I pop alot of shit that much is obvious, I'm only nice with the wrappin' 'cause I got a gift 
 And ya pockets need axe it ain't got a scent, I'm pretty set in my ways so why I gotta dip 
 You'll lukewarm and I am your father prick, no catholic priest, get off your fathers dick 
 You pussies just love givin' alot of lip, well I'm abstinant, that's why you ain't gotta hit 
 I ain't stupid, I paint lucid pictures, I make moves like that Frank Lucas nigga 
 Shoulda been in the march on Washington, but I'm a king, so march on Washington 
 This is my year, from March on watch the kid, this that real chronic. go head you can spark it, get lit, 
 This track is the looseleaf I was born to rip, I make it rain like Storm in a porno flick 
 Made her leave her ex-man and get it on with him, call Micheal Buffer motherfucker get it on with him 
 No homo, but you niggas climbing Brokeback mountain 
 I'm so crack, you sold that, I hope that found 'em 
 This is the product my nigga no back countin' 
 You ain't speakin' English, you the pope, that's wildin' 
 You pop e and think you leadin' the faith, well I'm a can of Red-Bull, I can keep 'em awake 
 I invest time in music, I guess I need more money, till then November 10th's the new 420, 
 So roll up and get a hit of the piff, or buy yourself a Nixon lollipop and lick on a dick, bitch, 
 And I fucked up and I'm keepin' it
