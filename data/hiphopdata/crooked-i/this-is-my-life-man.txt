 Life as a shorty shakin be so rough every every 
 Life as a shorty shakin be so rough 
 Every life as a shorty shakin be so rough every every 
 Life as a shorty shakin be so rough 
 Here s how it started out 
 1 day my fathers out 
 He nevr came back 
 7 kidz in my mamaz house 
 So now we drumerd out 
 Money wise we quater drowned 
 Get that green paper by enemies 
 Now that's what I'm about 
 And here s another reason 
 It's not the summer season 
 Ain't no utilities on in my house 
 My little brother freezin 
 How can I hustle sleepin' 
 Late night to the cud I'm creeping 
 I can hear that money breathing 
 I leave you bust in sleeping 
 Them streets were under handed 
 Too young to understand it 
 It makes my nerves bad 
 Thugin as the youngest band hun 
 But I cud not run and had it 
 I had to man up 
 I wanted to go to college probably fucked my plans up 
 I wannt to be a scholar how I ended in hand cuffs 
 Every night my mamaz cryin 
 But I got to stand tough 
 Look at me I'm waiving pistols 
 Gimmi every thing you got I screeming 
 15 and I'm on a mission 
 God help me get away from these deamons 
 This is my life man you say you understand 
 U claim you feelin' my pain but you really don't give a damn 
 U c me in them streets 
 No lyin' on these beach 
 I speak the truth and proof 
 Man I tell you who I am 
 This is my life man you say you understand 
 U claim you feelin' my pain but you really don't give a damn 
 U c me in them streets 
 No lyin' on these beach 
 I speak the truth and proof 
 Man I tell you who I am 
 15 and I'm on a mission 
 God help me get away from these deamons 
 They block my rightous vision 
 I can c them even when I dreamin' 
 Wish we was the cause to struggle 
 Wish we was all in trouble 
 Wish we get pass all the mistries 
 Wish we can solve the puzzle 
 People don't understand me I got to help my family 
 My focus is un canny 
 What caused for the future hemi 
 Enimies wouldn't care to twist me 
 Gun shots here barely miss me 
 When you thugin out there is risky 
 But the man upstairs is with me 
 I've lost so many homies some even burned alive 
 V r been part of this shit 
 Way b4 we learn to drive 
 Only thing you hearing in both ears is that verse 5 
 'Cause when you leave on with ur chrome you won't return alive 
 What kind of person am i 
 Goin' up in this savage hood 
 Wish I was average man 
 Crooked I is damaged goods 
 My past is not the best 
 Its bad and I confess 
 But I gotta make it so so many don't think on my success 
 This is my life man you say you understand 
 U claim you feelin' my pain but you really don't give a damn 
 U c me in them streets 
 No lyin' on these beach 
 I speak the truth and proof 
 Man I tell you who I am 
 This is my life man you say you understand 
 U claim you feelin' my pain but you really don't give a damn 
 U c me in them streets 
 No lyin' on these beach 
 I speak the truth and proof 
 Man I tell you who I am 
 This is my life man its much more than music homie 
 Stare at me this is the young man's medicine right here 
 This is my life homie 
 U know I'm talkin' about 
 Way more than music 
 Ghetto America 
 Ghetto mother fuckin' America 
 This is the life he gave me 
 This is my life homie 
 Life as a shorty shakin be so rough 
 Life as a shorty shakin be so rough every every 
 Life as a shorty shakin be so rough every every 
 Life as a shorty shakin be so rough 
 Rough
