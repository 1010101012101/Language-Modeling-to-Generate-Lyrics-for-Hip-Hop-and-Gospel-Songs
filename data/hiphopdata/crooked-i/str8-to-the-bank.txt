Yeah, I'm comin' at niggas every week now 
 Every 7 days, nigga, I'm droppin' fire 
 Hip Hop Weekly, haha 
 Crooked I, C.O.B. is the Movement 
 Circle Of Bosses, I'm on the Left Coast man 
 Yeah, you niggas know 
 This is a letter to my true fans 
 Take the letter N of the end of fan add a M 
 Yeah, you my true fam 
 I ain't never needed a new Stan 
 Just a new stance to understand the dude's the truth, damn 
 Kiss a record executives ass I can't do 
 They wanna rape you before they Bathin' Ape you 
 I'm clappin' my hands, pussy rapper well done 
 They bend you over made you spell run, are you in? (R-U-N) 
 Now that some deep shit 
 I'm on some G-shit like getting' ya peeps hit 
 Not givin' a fuck the least bit 
 My trigger click, lick your teeth split 
 Quick as E-Swift sip the liquor 
 That's how quick a niggas heat spit 
 I'm rap terror, I'm meetin' niggas insides 
 Heart dark as the mascara surrounds your friend's eyes 
 Y'all small French fries insides 
 This brother lynch guys 
 You'll be dead way before the stench dies 
 I'm a way better swinger like I was trained by Mayweather Senior 
 Crooked they ain't never seen ya 
 Grey leather seats in the Modena 
 Shit that straight cheddar bringer 
 Still thuggin' wave middle fingers 
 Bosstradamus - this year I'm droppin' BOSS, I promise 
 Haters yeah I came across your comments 
 While I was lost off in the Bahamas 
 With a awesome little mama, like Buffy, peelin' off pajamas 
 Pussy so good I threw her some cheese son 
 Dick was even better so she gave me a refund 
 Speakin' of dick, I'm thinkin' you pricks can eat one 
 And don't ride mine when that summer heat come 
 They say the truth shall come to the light 
 I guess the spotlight is on me when I'm clutchin' a mic 
 Clutchin' it like chrome pipes 
 Not the kind you find under a bike 
 The kind that make swines run for your life 
 All you best rappers alive 
 You make a nigga laugh till I cry 
 Put the cash up, dance with the 'I' 
 You can be the best rapper alive after I die 
 Then I come back twice, rappin' with the passion of Christ 
 Married to the streets 
 Made her sign a preen up 
 Takin' my paper to the grave, bury me G'd up 
 LBC'd up, yeah, C.O.B.'d up 
 So far ahead, you meth heads better speed up 
 Niggas pop pills, getting' E'd up 
 Me, I'm addicted to Lunesta 'cause I do it in my sleep what?!?! 
 B.O.S.S. 
 See you next week, haha!
