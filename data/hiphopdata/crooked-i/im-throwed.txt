Yeah 
 There's different ways to rock this motherfuckin' mic man 
 You got your regular rhyme-schemes 
 You got your off-beat flow 
 Your double-time spit 
 If you don't know how to rap each and every fuckin' way, 
 How are you calling yourself an emcee, HUH? 
 Yeah, Hip-Hop Weekly, Crooked I, C.O.B. 
 Treacherous Records is in the motherfuckin' house 
 We doin' this one early 
 You know why? 
 Motherfuck D 
 Motherfuck M 
 Only "X" I know is triple X fa sho 
 My white tee is pro club and it's hanging extra low 
 Disrespecting the West, a smith and wesson check the hoe 
 Pookie from new jack, smoking them chris rocks 
 Bullets in ya mouth, now that's how ya lick shots 
 To tha, tick tock big rocks in my Slick Rick watch 
 Six drops, nigga this is Hip-Hop, bitch 
 That's right, you don't like what we rap about 
 Keep wrapping your mouth around your crack pipe 
 Put your lips on them pussy lips I beat up last night 
 Since his ass in the dark, fucking with a flashlight 
 Motherfuck D 
 Motherfuck M 
 Only "X" I know is Malcolm X, and oh yes 
 Professor X, Sadat X, and X-Pand 
 But DMX a hoe, enough of that crackhead 
 With that said, I'm looking for the spineless 
 For Rucker's finest, I'm yelling MOTHERFUCK IMUS 
 You know what his crime is, same as Michael Richards 
 I'm looking for those timers, 'cause Crooked's 'bout to getcha 
 I'm taking it to them Death Certificate days 
 Dodger hat, Rhyme Syndicate shades 
 King Tee dookie rope, Where I'm from, Young niggas get paid 
 Drinking liquor just to piss on your grave 
 West Coast nigga 
 Back it up whenever God's gift spit it 
 If you want it you can get it, I'm so Todd Smith wit' it 
 I hop, skip, pivot, you not shit 
 You pop shit, my glock spit shots quicker than clocks tick minutes 
 Don't want it, don't start it, chrome pistol on target 
 Won't miss, you gon' spark it, tearing through bones and cartilage 
 Putting niggas on glow-in-the-dark shit 
 Ghost's floating over they own carcus 
 Fuck I goes hard bitch! 
 Eastside, Long Beach, till I fucking croak 
 No joke, ay Woof Wang, what up loc! 
 This is C, this is R, this is double-O K 
 This is E, D, you niggas ain't fuckin' with me 
 Hey you, you with the glass dick in ya mouth 
 If I ever ever ever ever EVER catch you disrespecting the West again 
 We gon' slap the monkey shit out your punk ass 
 C.O.B. nigga 
 Crackhead! 
 You can't even say "crack the window" around this fuckin' junkie 
 Nigga say "crack the door" and he start looking on the floor 
 And FUCK Imus too 
 See ya next week
