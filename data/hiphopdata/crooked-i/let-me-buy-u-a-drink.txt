Let me buy you a drink 
 We got something in common 
 I see the pain in your eyes 
 And I got my mind on my problems 
 I'm probably high as you think 
 And I'm about to sink to the bottom 
 She said I bet you a fighter 
 I can tell a rider when I spot em' 
 So tell me what's on your mind 
 Told her where do I start 
 Said I don't even know you 
 Then I started spillin' my heart 
 Somebody give me a spark 
 I'm feeling empty and dark 
 Said I just made a mistake 
 And it's about to rip me apart 
 Man I cheated on my baby 
 And I broke up my cribs 
 Somebody told her what I did 
 She looked up and woke up my kids 
 Left a note on the mirror 
 You never know where we lived 
 And if you ever go to court 
 Nigga you know what it is 
 Yeah your boy deals drugs for a livin' 
 You know how that custody works 
 Before they give you our children they'll put you in custody first 
 That's the hustler's curse 
 I'm getting fucked in reverse 
 I know the woman is her 
 I wonder what's in her purse 
 How she feedin' my kids 
 Every second she gone 
 Got me checkin' my phone 
 Should've left them headphones alone 
 Now my best friend is gone 
 And I just needed to think 
 She said I feel you for real 
 As we proceeded to drink 
 Drown our pain and our drinks mane 
 I'ma buy you a drank 
 Go head and drown your sorrows 
 Let tomorrow take care of tomorrow 
 I'ma buy you a drank 
 (Let me buy you a drink) 
 We got something in common 
 See the pain in your eyes 
 Leave my mind on my problems 
 Are you as shy as I think 
 Or we gon' right to the bottom 
 Or what's this story of your soul 
 The next round I got em' 
 Tell me what's on your mind 
 She said it's aight I'm dyin' 
 She said she needed some space 
 I could tell she was cryin' 
 Tear tracks on her face 
 Baby boy I ain't lyin' 
 Had to cruise in my ride 
 Because my dude on the side 
 Was protecting me best 
 Was respecting me best 
 Did a pregnancy test 
 Was it pregnancy? yes 
 How can I tell my fiance 
 I'm scared of him now 
 She said my character's foul 
 I'm not bearin' this child 
 And I'm steadily stressed 
 He think he's his and he love it 
 He's pullin' out books 
 Reading stories to my stomach 
 Wish I wasn't creepin' on my man 
 But I done it 
 He wasn't making me feel wanted 
 So keep it one hun'ed 
 He used to bring me flowers 
 Sing me songs in the shower 
 Before I got pregnant 
 We used to argue every hour 
 Now our house is a love nest 
 So I got to confess 
 I don't want my future decided by a blood test 
 Hey bartender 
 I'ma buy you a drank 
 Go head and drown your sorrows 
 Let tomorrow take care of tomorrow 
 I'ma buy you a drank 
 (Let me buy you a drink) 
 We got something in common 
 See the pain in your eyes 
 Leave my mind on my problems 
 Are you as shy as I think 
 Or we gon' right to the bottom 
 Or what's this story of your soul 
 The next round I got em' 
 I'ma buy you a drank 
 (Let me buy you a drink) 
 Yeah 
 Put ya hands up 
 If you think it's something real 
 Keep ya heads up 
 Whoa whoa ba-di-bi-di-bi-whoa 
 I'ma buy you a drank 
 Whoa whoa ba-di-bi-di-bi-whoa 
 Whoa whoa ba-di-bi-di-bi-whoa
