So many memories I don't understand 
 They got me weak in the knees like I don't wanna stand 
 I try to snap back like a rubberband 
 But flashbacks got another plan 
 To bury this rap cat under land 
 My closest aunt fell victim to a mad man 
 He rapped her he stabbed her he through her in the trash can 
 In Tulsa Oklahoma da home of the GAP ban 
 They buried Charlene boomie 
 My biggest rap fan 
 I can't express how much I miss the time I spent with you 
 God why they have to kill my mamas twin sister 
 Niqqa you lucky cops sent you to jail 
 'Cause I was comin' to send you to hell 
 After my choppers wings split you 
 I was jus a shorty when my cousin Bobby died 
 A star runnin' back from Long Beaches probably high 
 His friend and his wife set off the drama right 
 He caught them in bed which let to his homicide 
 Right on his death bed prepared to die 
 He wrote a song for his wife 
 The title That's Not A Far Goodbye 
 'Cause goddamn is not a fair goodbye 
 Young or not 
 Guns I woulda popped for you 
 Where was i? 
 I can't forget my Aunt Zeb 
 Since you left I been missin' you 
 And I will till my last breath 
 Why do so many loved ones have to meet a fast death 
 They wanted me to succeed how can I half step? 
 Look up in the sky, tears in my eyes 
 Its hard to say goodbye even gangstas cry 
 I'm in a dark room talkin' to pictures 
 Too many loved ones lost and I miss ya god knows that I miss ya 
 And even though I'm strong, now that you're gone 
 Its hard to carry on even Gangstas cry 
 Late at night I get lost in the Scriptures 
 Wish I could dig off in your coffin and get ya I miss ya 
 I put my pain on paper 
 There's nothing else I can do to remove it 
 My music is therapeutic if I don't use it I lose it 
 It's so easy to pick up liquor and abuse it 
 When life is confusing you on a way that you need to view shit 
 I look at my gun and think of my buddies Leak and Bloody 
 'Cause this is the same demon that took my people from me 
 A lot of my homies was killed over illegal money 
 I lost so many to bangin' dat it ain't even funny 
 Its Cookie, its Ramon, its Charles, too many to name 
 Its solemn and shane, its pain in memories lane 
 It's a shame when obituaries stack thicker than dictionaries 
 I question is my mind mentally sane 
 My uncle LeRoy is gone, god let 'em in, he was more of a father 
 Figure than His brother ever been 
 Look at my brain it's like the head of a veteran 
 I fight more pain than Excedrin medicine ever did 
 I can't sleep my nightmares are comin' unannounced 
 I dream about people I love 'cause I'm runnin' elf 
 Is rap lyrics my therapy they don't wanna bounce 
 Its trapped spirits I'm thinkin' my minds a haunted house 
 Sometimes I pray to my creator till my knees hurt 
 I need work, my granny use to say I need church 
 This is for my people beneath dirt 
 We makin' songs gettin' tattoos and rockin' 
 Rest In peace t-shirts 
 Look up in the sky, tears in my eyes 
 Its hard to say goodbye even gangstas cry 
 I'm in a dark room talkin' to pictures 
 Too many loved ones lost and I miss ya god knows that I miss ya 
 And even though I'm strong, now that you're gone 
 Its hard to carry on even Gangstas cry 
 Late at night I get lost in the Scriptures 
 Wish I could dig off in your coffin and get ya I miss ya
