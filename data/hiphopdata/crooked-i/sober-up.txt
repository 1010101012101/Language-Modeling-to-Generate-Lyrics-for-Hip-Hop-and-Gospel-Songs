I broke down a while ago 
 Finally picking up the pieces 
 Memoirs I had are undefeated 
 I feel depleted 
 I don't talk to God as a matter of fact I plead with 
 At times I hate my reflection and others I'm conceited 
 Half the time I'm arrogant other times I'm vengeful 
 At times it's to convince me, at times it's to convince you 
 Done a lot of wrong but I ain't never felt resentful 
 It's been so many times I've lost track of who to repent to 
 Half the time I'm in the cut 
 Don't want you to notice me 
 Roll with me and you'll see that I'm only awkward socially 
 Half the time I'm spiteful, double barrel rifle 
 I owe so many payback I fee l like I got the right too 
 So if you need a case in point you can refer to Budden 
 And it will prove that pain killers never murdered nothing 
 All it did was make me succumb put ice in me 
 Now revenge is the place it takes me from 
 I'm strong 
 Strong enough to catch contact (?) 
 Smell it as soon as you get in my ride 
 See with me, rules never apply 
 Don't tell me how I should live my life 
 Put your seat back, got it if you need that 
 You should really f-ck with me 
 Tell me if you wanna ride or die, la la la la la la la la 
 Listen up as the center reports 
 My inner thoughts are like a inner war 
 Head exact as a trembling force on my mental ward 
 Men are distraught 
 Every word from his sentence the boss 
 It's brought to you like the people your minister's Porsche 
 Tight roping on dental floss 
 Before the haters begin to get lost 
 Coke and weed got my temperament off 
 But why would my temper get lost 
 When as soon as the temperature frost I'm probably 
 Having intercourse in a resort 
 Criminal report, pricey condo's at a minimal cost 
 My train of thought ain't as simple as yours 
 So if our paths happen to accidentally cross 
 I pray that you can overlook all my miniature flaws 
 Until then lets let the bass kick 
 Take the shots great I don't see a need to chase it 
 Trying to fight the urge till there's something to replace it 
 I welcome y'all to be my co-pilots on this spaceship 
 Yo, me and the game would get so blunted 
 We'd order take out from the Chinese stores 
 They make sure you bring change for a hundred 
 Rob em, safety on the metal's off 
 Figured if we beat the breaks off em 
 Then how the f-ck was he gon pedal off 
 Some live and die by the high, I was born by it 
 Since Pac gave my mom the needle like go on try it 
 Got me feeling like ain't a nigga can harm me 
 So I go and scoop a mommy that wanna come join the army 
 She was so militant, disciplined, diligent 
 So I whispered to her, bet you wouldn't mind shilling it 
 I got to know her on my sofa 
 I gave her my honorable discharge and she took like a soldier 
 Since she the type you gotta watch when she come around 
 Really she only get high so she can come down 
 Lost her when I said she ain't gotta settle 
 Once you start to handle life you'll be on the same level 
 Crooked I 
 When I was five this what my father said 
 I should have pulled you out and left you on your momma's waterbed 
 You asked me, my poppa's dead 
 Alcoholic jeans from him since a toddler bottle fed 
 Put me on your stainless I'm brainless, I'm a hollow head 
 My life was the craziest 
 Surprised I'm even walking, can you blame me if I'm atheist 
 But I ain't Stephen Hawkings 
 I know God is in my radius 
 I can see him walking in the face of an innocent baby but not when preacher, s talking 
 My people sleep in coffins I miss 'em I'm breaking 
 Down in the face of a bad bitch that I'm supposed to be taking down 
 Baby ride while I'm crying, I'm dying inside 
 Cause my pain is beside a giant leviathan and I'm hiding from the World 
 They hit me with everything but the kitchen sink 
 How ironic? same place I vomit when I lick a drink 
 Apparently I need to get a shrink 
 How can therapy take care of me when I don't give a fuck what niggas think!
