You know what's mind burgling 
 Niggas be acting like bitches, you know 
 Man why you sign to Death Row? 
 Get out my business bitch 
 Man why you leave Death Row? 
 Nigga, it's always business, it's never personal homie 
 Get it right 
 I see you mothafuckas, I see you over there 
 And I know you wanna fuck with me 
 I got my eyes on you suckas 
 But I don't really care 
 'Cause I keep a burner tuck with me 
 Yeah, niggas is under aware 
 I'm their worst fucking nightmare 
 Send shots to the night air 'cause I don't fight fair 
 Watch you die right there, without a slight care 
 Like: "Yeah nigga, youse a snake" 
 Type of nigga that get mad over the moves you make 
 Look at the rules you break 
 You choose to hate, shake your friend when he loose his cake 
 You dudes is fake, bitch niggas 
 When the guns cock, choose your fate 
 Click triggers, when I bust glocks, loose your face 
 Ditch diggers, with one shot, its news at eight 
 We six figure, then a thug got loot to chase 
 A rich nigga, we ballin' while you fuckers in the drought 
 'Cause if it ain't about the money, tz, what the fuck is it about 
 Catch me in the beach house, its straight thuggin' in the south 
 With my nigga Humpty Hump, punchin' you suckas in the mouth 
 Droppin' a matter frightenin' rate 
 Striking at lightning's pace, one slice, your lungs pipes deflate 
 Mad at me cause your ice is fake 
 I got B.O.S.S. written across my license plate 
 Life is great, bitch nigga 
 I see you mothafuckas, I see you over there 
 And I know you wanna fuck with me 
 I got my eyes on you suckas 
 But I don't really care 
 'Cause I keep a burner tuck with me
