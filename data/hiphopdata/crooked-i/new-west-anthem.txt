Transmitting live from sector 3 
 L.b.c. 
 Everybody on the streets waiting for my album 
 The shit never dropped people askin me how come 
 Left deathrow in 04 was the outcome 
 Reason this nigga round 'cause I was without one 
 All about my money homie, I gotta pile some 
 Since I'm the one rappers getting they style from 
 C.o.b block boy, crooked I pull out guns 
 When I'm out east they sayin' crooked you wile some 
 I been in the mix, quick flippin them legitimate chips 
 Dime piece I keep 10 of dem chicks 
 Even foreign women stick a citizenship, sit in my cinnamon whip 
 They love a criminal on a gentleman tip 
 I with my click, I don't fuck with you other clowns 
 Rappers in my city, bigly when I was underground 
 Now they wanna act friendly soon as I come around. 
 Maybe 'cause the medallion bringing a hundred pounds 
 What now 
 Crooked I 
 Gangstas don't dance we 2 step, nobody can stop us, we strollin on 
 When you see us in the club, say hi to the new west 
 We gon get it on baby, all night long, let them haters go 
 Gangstas don't dance we 2 step, nobody can stop us, we strollin on 
 When you see us in the club, say hi to the new west 
 We gon get it on baby, all night long 
 Everybody from the west know crookeds a boss mayne 
 Reppin c.o.b., the circle of boss gang 
 Haters though we missed the target, thought we was off aim 
 Disappeared a year so these suckas talking 
 52 blue diamonds that's how the cross came. 
 Half a millie on the bling, step up ma floss game 
 Niggas used to clown, big w8 take small bang 
 Now I push around chunky whips, that y'all can't 
 I'm still in the game, nah fuck dat, I'm killin' the game 
 Get your dame, she feelin' the chain, she's willin' to sit in the range 
 In the range, infinite intimate thangs, between us she the sillest insane 
 Feel my pain mayne, hood life bumpin my arteries 
 I'm an organ donor now, who want a part of me 
 Haters in the clun, y'all dudes is rnb 
 The movie is called fuck you niggas starring me 
 Pardon me 
 Gangstas don't dance we 2 step, nobody can stop us, we strollin on 
 When you see us in the club, say hi to the new west 
 We gon get it on baby, all night long, let them haters go 
 Gangstas don't dance we 2 step, nobody can stop us, we strollin on 
 When you see us in the club, say hi to the new west 
 We gon get it on baby, all night long 
 Everybody know the industries the new dope game 
 That's why the flow came potent as cocaine 
 Critics say I'm jus another rapper looking for mo fame 
 Till you walk a mile in my nikes you don't know pain 
 I been on my grind since gazelles and rope chains 
 Dealt with the ups and downs like it was no thang 
 Now I give a fo fo whenever I role mayne 
 Shoot it at your shoes, you dance like soul train 
 I been in the club, so promoters let me in with a snub 
 It's a million pretty women to rub 
 These bitches is feelin' a thug, swimmin they cris and livin' it bub 
 Dodger fitted, this how this nigga does, gimme love 
 Baby wanna know the reason I'm rich, 
 Different colour hardtops, every season I switch 
 Thas how we do it on the east side, speakin' of which 
 When you see me wit my people, long beach in this bitch 
 Deep in this bitch 
 Gangstas don't dance we 2 step, nobody can stop us, we strollin on 
 When you see us in the club, say hi to the new west 
 We gon get it on baby, all night long, let them haters go 
 Gangstas don't dance we 2 step, nobody can stop us, we strollin on 
 When you see us in the club, say hi to the new west 
 We gon get it on baby, all night long
