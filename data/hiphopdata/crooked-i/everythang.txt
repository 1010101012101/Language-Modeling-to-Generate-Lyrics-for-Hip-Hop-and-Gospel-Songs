You got a big mouth juts like the rest 
 You can't fuck with me ill put you to the test 
 I can't comprehend my own state of mind 
 Leave me here to suffer 
 Leave you here to die 
 Didn't you learn to stay away 
 Shut your mouth or ill just break away 
 The pressure is up and I could kill 
 Now is the time to step up if you ever will 
 Wait till I get a hold of you 
 I will if it's the last thing I do 
 A month later I'm looking back 
 I should have realized this 
 Sneak attack 
 You want to be my something 
 My everything 
 You want to be my something 
 My everything 
 You want to be my something 
 My everything 
 You want to be my something 
 My everything.
