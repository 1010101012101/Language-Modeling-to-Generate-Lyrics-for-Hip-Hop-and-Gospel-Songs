The Westcoast ain't the same without me 
 'Cause I'm packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto 
 This how we do it in the LBC 
 Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto 
 Zoop zoop this is COB 
 Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto 
 Turn it up let it vibrate the streets 
 Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto 
 I'm from the hood where Grandparents are 35 
 I don't bang, I hustle but still I'm certified 
 Last n-gga who shot I heard he died 
 Cause my address is 187 East Murder Drive 
 All the pain in the my past I gotta verbalize 
 It can't stay on my head, I gotta circumcise 
 My tears drop on the song, they don't prefer the eyes 
 A chick left me for that but that was her demise 
 Money cars and jewelry that sh-t had her astounded 
 She searched for the essence of me and bounced when she found it 
 I'm a complex figure, I'm a never ignorant, getting goals accomplished 
 Grew up in a lot of projects, Lochness hotness n-gga 
 On a conquest to digest liquor 
 In a contest to progress quicker 
 Than any in 2011, by making my thought process sicker 
 Bigger, stronger, faster 
 Homie tell me is it a fact 
 Through negative you can make yourself a prisoner 
 If so I call them thoughts an unwelcome visitor 
 Music is therapeutic, I'ma get help from listeners 
 I told you I'm so grow up I don't need therapy right 
 America's nightmare carries a mic 
 And I stay far away from snake fake character types 
 I vow to never f-ck with you like I married a dyke 
 Keep it real when I make a joint 
 Streets tried to break me, couldn't find my breaking point 
 The other night I had a dream 
 I seen God he was a beam of light 
 His physical form was human being like 
 He gave me a couple of warnings in order for me to keep my life 
 Can't tell you what but I cna say that he was right 
 I dream 16's homie I don't need to write 
 Pick up a pen in your session, I'm just trying to be polite 
 Cover my genius up cause rappers are envious 
 When I say I finished my verse they like "is he serious" 
 5 minute lyricist with an emphasis on a structure 
 Plus the details I describe in the sentances 
 Mind you my timing better be live from the Genesis 
 I bet metaphors and one liners are limitless 
 First I'm on the West on some (?) 
 Then the spit will be in Italy in a Gondola on some Venice sh-t 
 Bars beyond bars has its benefits 
 I'm Favre, busted chin, fractured ankle, 
 I don't know when to quit (never) 
 And old rappers when see me, don't say hi 
 They call me 'cause I'm f-cking with Shady 
 I say okay bye 
 The Westcoast ain't the same without me 
 'Cause I'm packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto 
 This how we do it in the LBC 
 Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto 
 Zoop zoop this is COB 
 Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto 
 Turn it up let it vibrate the streets 
 Packing metal, packing metal, packing metal, acting ghetto
