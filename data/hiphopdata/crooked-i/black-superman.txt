East side long beach, blap blap... cob, circle of boss;s 
 It's your boy crooked, let's do it to em... 
 They call me black superman 
 Black rouger man 
 Fast shootin hand 
 Clap your brand new sedan 
 I'm raps luther van 
 Got hoes throwin' panties 
 Watch the flow blow as if I rap through a fan, man 
 Everybody knows from sets vargos to varios 
 That chrome shotty give your body holes 
 And I body hoes 
 Last chick they tried to set me up 
 I squoze the tommy, mami adios 
 I'm a gangsta 
 Vest and a chain 
 Ain't no questions wether 
 I'm destined to reign 
 Wont rest till I'm the best in the game 
 Me and kanye got somethin' in common 
 You have to attach the west to the name crooked 
 Give me mine or I'm gonna squab with critics 
 I never rock without my dodger fitted 
 Me and DJ skee in a level 3 benz brabus kitted 
 I'm a boss, who got a problem with it 
 I live it so I can spit it 
 Poetic picture, oscar vivid 
 So when you that boxter dippin, 
 You know that a mobsters in it... 
 Wait a minute, I'm above the law 
 I ain't a painter, but I love to draw 
 Can I thug wid y'all... 
 Ughh 
 Yeah, yeah 
 I'm black superman 
 Blap blap cob, circle of boss;s 
 Yeah nigga... 
 From this industry long beach wont leave 
 Even if I gotta stick a chrome piece to ya dome piece, don't breathh... 
 They cold slugs from some og's 
 We so thug in the pro cuts with the long sleeves 
 Niggaz that raised me, they sold keys 
 Some of 'em spinnin small face hundreds, the same colour as old cheese 
 I won't squueze, hoe please 
 I'm so cold when I breeth it's a 20 below (de) grees 
 Don't fist fight another round 
 Big pipes sit right under my pin stripe button down 
 Sit tight not another sound 
 I egnite another round 
 Quick like lightening 
 Put your click right underground 
 I hear you sayin' some shit 
 But it ain't true 
 You niggaz gang banging 
 Claimin a gang that don't even clame you 
 I still do what you can't do, cob, circle of boss;s 
 We ain't through nigga 
 Yeah nigga yo all know what it is, dynasty cob, circle of bosses nigga 
 Crip or blood, cash over bithces, yeah nigga what 
 Yo skee, let's do business man
