There comes a time in everybody's life 
 (Na, na, na, na, na) 
 When they gotta make the change 
 I'm tired of being a villain, I'ma change 
 (Na, na, na) 
 I'm not gon' be your villain anymore 
 And don't think I'll live my life up keeping score 
 I'm not gon' be your villain anymore 
 And don't think I'll live my life up keeping score 
 I'm not gon' be 
 Flat broke, living in the hood 
 When I need money, I be up to no good 
 Your family's rich, my family's poor 
 I would trade places with you if I could 
 But I gotta play with the cards I was dealt 
 Down on my knees, ask God for some help 
 Man of the house, my dad walked out 
 Mistakes get made when you father yourself 
 I was raised on the block, a menace to society 
 Runt as a little kid, I was innocent entirely 
 Time went by, life got hard 
 'Til I start feeling like a villain was inside of me 
 Mad at the world but I can't cry 
 Heart full of pain when I can't lie 
 I did a lot of dirt but now I wanna change 
 To the bad guy in me I say bye 
 I'm not gon' be your villain anymore 
 And don't think I'll live my life up keeping score 
 I'm not gon' be your villain anymore 
 (I don't wanna be the villain no more) 
 And don't think I live my life up keeping score 
 (Hey, hey, hey, no more) 
 I'm not gon' be 
 I don't wanna be the villain no more 
 Inside my mind, fighting my own war 
 Half of me wants to be the good guy 
 But the other half wants to kick down your door 
 Mixed emotions, they start to confuse me 
 Last night I hopped in my car with a uzi 
 Haters don't feel me, some wanna kill me 
 I don't really wanna be the star of this movie 
 Too many years I done fought off a grant 
 I'ma bail like Christian and walk off the set 
 You can tell the director and the producer 
 To kick that news when it fall off my neck 
 I was hanging myself, I couldn't breathe 
 Trapped in the ghetto, I couldn't leave 
 I couldn't think, I couldn't see 
 I couldn't take it man, I couldn't be 
 Guess I thought there was nothing else out there 
 For a dropout raised on welfare 
 Brave enough to rob a bank in a heartbeat 
 But too scared to take my life elsewhere 
 It ain't easy to go straight 
 Blind faith stepped to the plate 
 I packed up my bag, I walked out the door 
 I ain't coming back around this bitch 'til I'm great 
 I'm not gon' be your villain anymore 
 (I don't wanna be the villain no more) 
 And don't think I live my life up keeping score 
 (No more) 
 I'm not gon' be your villain anymore 
 (I don't wanna be the villain no more) 
 And don't think I live my life up keeping score 
 (No more) 
 I'm not gon' be 
 Put your hands in the air if you feel me 
 I'ma change my life if it kill me 
 Put your hands in the air if you feel me 
 I'ma change my life if it kill me 
 Put your hands in the air if you feel me 
 I'ma change my life if it kill me 
 Put your hands in the air if you feel me 
 I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be 
 I'm not gon' be your villain anymore 
 And don't think I live my life up keeping score 
 I'm not gon' be 
 No more
