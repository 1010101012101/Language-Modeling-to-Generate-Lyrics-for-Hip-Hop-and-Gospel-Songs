"Somebody lift me up, yeah 
 And give me a hannnnnd 
 Give me a ride, I'm sliding off the highway 
 There's a curve in the road 
 I don't know when I'm going, crazy" 
 Verbalizin my fiend murder 
 Communicatin while you debatin usin' machine squirters 
 Brrap, that trigger's my tongue, I let you lick it 
 Nigga that, fo'-fifth'll, lift a nigga, whole clique up 
 The Lord call for your soul, it's time to go pick up 
 Answer the horn, it's blowin' at you, you cold stiff up 
 My heat, heatin my whole hip up, all we do is court strippers 
 Your metal freezin like it's a morgue zipper 
 I (I) ride around with Preme 
 Not the Preme from Queens, but the Preme from {?} 
 'Bout to change the game, 'bout to fly the desert, eagle 
 For y'all people like the wing's the clip, and the barrel's the beak 
 My perilous fleece, I'ma throw on them diamonds 
 I'm a Pharaoh deceased, like a spawn was rhymin 
 And, I would advice ya not attempt to 
 New (Temptations), the gun harmonizin 
 Every bullet's a note 
 I write with a firing pen every time the, trigger pull it's a quote 
 Inside a poof full of smoke 
 Sniffin lines of that gunpowder I'm hotter than a pair of boots and a coat 
 And a turtleneck 
 The best rapper alive could be the best rapper that died, a murderous 
 If you ain't get it by now I'm suicidal 
 I'm wild, a nigga better than me is who I ain't heard of yet 
 So I ain't murdered yet 
 He ain't even been born, his momma's a virgin, she ain't even furtile yet 
 Prepare to get back - next time you take a shit 
 Stand and turn around and look in the toilet then compare me to THAT 
 Don't compare me to none of these motherfuckin 
 Wannabe hustlers tough until they standin in front of me duckin 
 It's off with yo' head nigga 'less you one of them Dodgers 
 We sound off as one, we gun harmonize!
