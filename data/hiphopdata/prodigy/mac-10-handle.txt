The best in the business 
 Yeah, it's about that time, ya heard? 
 We the best nigga, we back nigga 
 I sit alone in my dirty ass room 
 Starin' at candles, high on drugs 
 All alone wit my hand on Mac 10 handle 
 Schemin' on you niggaz 
 I sit alone in my dirty ass room 
 Starin' at candles, high on drugs 
 All alone wit my hand on Mac 10 handle 
 Schemin' on you niggaz 
 By myself in my four corner room watchin' Hard Boiled 
 I feel like I'm crazy, my brain on drugs 
 My bullet proof on run, flats late at the night 
 I'ma look for 'Cause 
 Just ride through his hood and when I see that chump 
 I'ma jump out the truck and dump my gun 
 You ain't neva been do it so you scared of that kinda shit 
 Hit me on a song and say, P pop a lot off shit 
 Too much of that gangsta music, nah, this reality rap 
 I really go through it in interrogation rooms 
 I don't crack, nigga, I don't got none for ya 
 Talk to my lawyer, shit 
 Nowadays is hard to kill 
 Be careful where you pull that trigger, they got you on film 
 They got eyes in the sky, we under surveillance 
 That on star on your car track everywhere you've been 
 Gotta watch what I say, they tappin' my cell phone 
 They wanna sneak and peak inside of my home 
 I'm paranoid and it's not the weed 
 In my rear view mirror these cars, they follow me 
 So I bust rights and lefts, lefts and rights 
 Till I stop seeing those Impala headlights 
 Then I circle my block to make sure it's smooth 
 Before I go upstairs to my four corner room 
 I sit alone in my dirty ass room 
 Starin' at candles, high on drugs 
 All alone wit my hand on Mac 10 handle 
 Schemin' on you niggaz 
 I sit alone in my dirty ass room 
 Starin' at candles, high on drugs 
 All alone wit my hand on Mac 10 handle 
 Schemin' on you niggaz 
 I be alone in my hot ass room 
 Smokin' dope, loadin' bullets in my clip for you 
 I ain't even wipin' my sweat, it's keepin' me cool 
 I ain't even sweatin' you niggaz, I'ma find you 
 Eventually it happens like this 
 At the club with his boys, at the mall with his bitch 
 Nigga think it's gon' be a fight 
 Death comes to those who wind me up 
 And you could beg me to stop but I just keep 
 Puttin' pressure on the trigger till you fast asleep 
 Like a baby 
 (Son wake up) 
 Ain't no maybe 
 Coulda, shoulda, woulda shot back, you too hasty 
 I'm so impulsive, I start gunnin' right in front of Jesus, Mary and Joseph 
 (Oh my God) 
 If that's what it is, nigga I'ma live 
 You not playin' me like the neighborhood bitch 
 (Ayo, Mary) 
 I sit alone in my dirty ass room 
 Starin' at candles, high on drugs 
 All alone wit my hand on Mac 10 handle 
 Schemin' on you niggaz 
 I sit alone in my dirty ass room 
 Starin' at candles, high on drugs 
 All alone wit my hand on Mac 10 handle 
 Schemin' on you niggaz 
 Yeah, that's right, you know how we do it nigga 
 (Uh, huh) 
 I sit up all night and plot on your head nigga 
 (Oh, we comin') 
 It's not a fuckin' game 
 (We comin', we comin', nigga) 
 Oh, we comin' nigga believe that 
 (If he should happen to write your name down) 
 We runnin' around gettin' this money on tour 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 (Should he speak out) 
 I really ain't got time for you bitch ass niggaz 
 But um, this weekend I got some time 
 You know what I'm sayin'? I might just put some work in 
 (Yeah we could fit 'em in, put 'em in the schedule) 
 It's like they forgot or somethin', I come poppin' for you nigga 
 I don't give a fuck who you wit, daytime, where the fuck we at 
 You betta stop, drop and roll nigga 
 (Uh, huh) 
 And it's on and poppin', high on drugs, that's right 
 Schemin' on you niggaz, Mac 10 handle 
 I use to drive a AC and kept a Mac in the engine 
 Is this is it, baby? 
 Have you heard of a dude named? 
 (Yo, it's the P) 
 Isn't it that stingy mothafucka 
 With an asshole full of money?
