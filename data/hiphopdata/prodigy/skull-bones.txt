I am not what you thought, I am all seen 
 I am the top of New York 
 This is Empire state boy sit 
 I ain't ballest in the worst flow 
 Bring it on, I am thrown 
 I am more than your worst nightmare

 G's I am God, I am purplexin 
 My bargglin hard, I am D ... 
 And who are you? 
 Nobody what are we? Anything, any rap in here 
 And the hip hop game wish to be 
 All r.a.p. grand wizard on the sixteens 
 That bust like ... 
 In Lord magazines I shine 
 Illuminate, get my aura is awsome 
 Illuminati is us, we are the origin 
 Of all inlighting 
 This pirates stole our shit 
 So, now you know. 
 Skulls and bones. 
 Skull-bo, scalp you 
 Scare the pussy a lot 
 When they find is you 
 Skull and bones

 Great white colors 
 All the whites cuts you

 When they'll find your 
 Skull and bones

 Will you ever make a move,

 Niggaz filthy, I am really to things that I rap 
 You just a custy trust me

 Fuck 'em fan bloody, all they're going through is hell

 Using gang glass joy, I wish I didn't kill 
 All r.ap. grand wizard on the sixteen 
 They spit like 47 and 50 cows I bang

 Of all inlighting

 So, now you know. 
 Skulls and bones. 
 Skull-bo, scalp you 
 Scare the pussy a lot 
 When they find is you 
 Skull and bones

 When they'll find your 
 Skull and bones
