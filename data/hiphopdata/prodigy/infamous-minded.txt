* Remake of Boogie Down Productions "Criminal Minded" 
 (Prodigy) 
 Yeah old school part one feel it 
 The realest, Who be the realest 
 Them niggaz stay 
 Infamous minded 
 U've been blinded 
 Cut on your face 
 Fucking with these mobb giants 
 They are the victims 
 We be the victors 
 Sometime a nigga gotta step up 
 And bring war, Spray ks 
 And go out in a blaze 
 Young guns learn to duck 
 So they won't catch strays 
 Wont shoot to be frontin' 
 Or to waste shots for nothin' 
 If I'm pulling out my torch 
 I'm gonn hit somethin', Whatever 
 Slugs through your avirex leather 
 I close one lid 
 So I could aim a little better 
 I stop firing 
 And de-cock the hammer 
 You need triads 
 I need to get up outta here 
 Don't really think It's cool to let another man 
 (Havoc) 
 "Let me buck that nigga son" 
 (Prodigy) 
 I hold my own cannon and shoot just as fast 
 Move with select few 
 Don't fuck with lil dude 
 Or little pistols 
 Strictly the big Ru's 
 Cause deuce-deuce its only good for hiding 
 I need big firepower when I'm riding 
 52 shot clips 
 You pop lips, Silence 
 And I don't stop dumping till I hear sirens 
 I'm not a boyz 'n' the hood addict 
 Menace fanatic 
 I live the street life for real 
 So I can brag it 
 Pop gave me gun lesson back when I was a kid 
 Now I fire more arms than he ever did 
 That's why 
 I keep things in proper prospective 
 And every album point y'all niggas in the right direction 
 There's no protection, when I'm on the mike 
 You couldn't fold me 
 If you trained all your life 
 You's a chump, I'm a champ 
 You broke, I'm top dollar 
 Niggaz gotta whole lotta mouth 
 That's no problem 
 Fake thugs lay down 
 Real killers don't yell it 
 Bring it don't sing it nigga 
 Use intelligence 
 Its evident you not, murder material 
 When you all alone, you pose guns in the mirror yo 
 Chinky, Rapper Noyd, Hav, G part 3, my nigga Bino and Nitty 
 Y'all feel me 
 Let me get deeper in the subject 
 Cause its gets me hard 
 Every nigga holding 
 Don't mean he gonn arc 
 Any nigga that show it 
 Need to disown it 
 Or get it tooken by another who deserve it 
 Listen, this is what it takes to survive today 
 Use your eyes, to my niggaz that's ride with me 
 And you see that nigga P, be the storm quiet 
 I'm holding, so ease back 
 I stay infamous minded 
 (Noyd) 
 Yeah yeah nigga, shit is real 
 You know 
 (Prodigy) 
 Infamous minded 
 (Noyd) 
 Yo, this niggaz outhere 
 We moving blindly dun, it's all about survival though 
 They don't know 
 You the top dawg for the rest to follow 
 (Prodigy) 
 Infamous minded 
 (Noyd) 
 You know how we do it killer 
 The Qb way, my way or no way 
 Queensbrige to our death day 
 (Prodigy) 
 Infamous minded 
 (Noyd) 
 Shit, why you think they call us infamous nigga 
 We earned the title nigga 
 Not cause it sounds tough dumb fuck 
 (Prodigy) 
 Infamous minded 
 (Prodigy) 
 When the bridge start rocking 
 The bridge, It keep rocking 
 When the bridge start rocking 
 The mobb'll keep rocking 
 When the bridge start rocking 
 Queens still be rocking 
 When the bridge start rocking 
 My niggaz keep popping 
 (Repeat chorus till fade)
