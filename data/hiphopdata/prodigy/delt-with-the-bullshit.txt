Dunn it's real like that 
 Uh, huh, yeah 
 Uh, huh, yeah 
 (Uh, huh) 
 Yeah, ha 
 (Solo on that ass [unverified] dealt with the bullshit) 
 Check me out, dunn 
 (Yeah) 
 Check me out now 
 (Out, yo) 
 Yo, feel me on the road, feel me at the shows 
 Feel me for what I stand for 
 And I'ma do it till the death, till I can't no more 
 Fuck a hoe, it's all about dough 
 Still, fuck her and still don't love 'em 
 That's word to mother 
 Uncover the truth, enjoy my youth 
 It's die or lose 
 I wonder what if I was sittin' in the pen 
 On the strength that I had to hurt something 
 'Cause my stomach hurtin' 
 I'm a cool nigga but don't let me start buggin' 
 Love my moms, love my little sis plus my little dunn 
 Niggas gotta eat, fuck settling for crumbs 
 Hell no, me a bum on the streets looking dumb 
 Till hell freezes over, yo, y'all niggas better run 
 'Cause I done dealt with the bullshit 
 Lived through the bullshit 
 So put a clamp on them loose lips 
 My niggas do kill shit 
 (Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow) 
 'Cause I done dealt with the bullshit 
 Lived through the bullshit 
 So put a clamp on them loose lips 
 My niggas do kill shit 
 (Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow) 
 Guns redundant 
 My dunns move in abundance 
 We loose cannons, my rugar will pop somethin' 
 What's all the frontin' 
 Being cavalier will get you nothing 
 Or maybe touched though 
 Keep pressing me and we be thumpin' 
 Like the (unverified) vs the hawks 
 When little boy got a foot long stuck in his back 
 And punctured his lungs 
 It's very brutal, how the N I C will do you 
 Yo, get Ko'ed and pissed on for being rude 
 Yeah, respect the colors and the flag I wave 
 Respect the I M D embroidery 
 My shit is classic and authentic, blowin' dick 
 Y'all niggas grafting my whole presence 
 Get your own shit 
 My voltage be higher than the wire pole get 
 King vulture, more flyer than your average rap pigeon 
 Now twist up your cheebas, I get deeper in debt 
 My rap page make niggas throw they reefer at us 
 Love me, bless me like you supposed to do 
 Just don't test me niggas I be toasted up 
 What 
 'Cause I done dealt with the bullshit 
 And lived through the bullshit 
 'Cause I done dealt with the bullshit 
 Lived through the bullshit 
 (No doubt, no doubt, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 So put a clamp on them loose lips 
 My niggas do kill shit 
 (Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow) 
 My style, identical to guns that burst 
 I'm like a fourth when I go off or even worse 
 It's like an ill box cutter fight where no one backs down 
 My shit burn, make 'em far from a clown 
 Ayyo, likewise 
 See a nigga that I can't trust is a nigga I despise 
 Then I reply with a cold shoulder 
 You ain't a gat holder, you just a crossover switchover 
 'Cause I done dealt with the bullshit 
 Lived through the bullshit 
 (No doubt, no doubt, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 So put a clamp on them loose lips 
 My niggas do kill shit 
 (Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow) 
 'Cause I done dealt with the bullshit 
 Lived through the bullshit 
 (Uh, huh, yeah) 
 So put a clamp on them loose lips 
 My niggas do kill shit 
 (Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow)
