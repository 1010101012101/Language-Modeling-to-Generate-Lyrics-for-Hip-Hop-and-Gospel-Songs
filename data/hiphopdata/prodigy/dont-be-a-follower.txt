It go hip-hop on our block 
 Always lead to some fights and gun shots 
 Niggas need to stop that bullshit hop 
 Unless it's really necessary to get hopped 
 You got asshole pulling out, busting on pounds 
 Just to hear the sound or to see the crowd bounce 
 Niggas need to save that shit for outside 
 Or take all that noise up the block, dunn, aiight, un 
 Staying at the times you got to drug a man 
 But goddamn, you fucking up my pussy plan 
 Fuck it, y'all niggas never learn, so why should I concern? 
 After the show, I'll grab my click and the tires burn 
 Off to the next pavilion 
 The infamous men, women and children 
 Stick together like dry cement pieces 
 Our story go too long for rap lines 
 Too many of my niggas died on the front lines 
 The Mobb history go too deep for rhyme 
 Could you feel a pain in the trilogy of my regiment 
 Please do, we write these for you 
 With the hope that my words sink through 
 Like on the page how the ink do 
 Hey, yo, dunn check it 
 My every hour that passes is guaranteed packed 
 'Cause the hour that's gone, ain't never coming back 
 I'm tired of wasted days, my eyes E&J glaze 
 Romp you tools flooded with smoke fumes 
 Make faster moves, my raps can't lose 
 Especially against you 
 How soon we forget niggas minds be getting absent 
 Not gone for a minute, y'all niggas trying to shit 
 It's time for Pee to turn back on the light switch 
 And pull your faggot ass click out the darkness 
 Yo, it's QB, queer bastard, we Queen's best 
 A quiet bullet will do yo ass justice 
 Why, you stupid fuck, look at you now 
 I can't believe how these niggas now a days gets down 
 He just a clown from a foul part of town, who barely blend in 
 He took my words on some personal shit 
 He just self-conscience 
 Trying to flip on some desperate shit 
 Don't be stupid, the Mobb been through it 
 Don't be a follower and get yo ass led to the fire
