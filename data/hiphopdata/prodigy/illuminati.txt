Talking: Fan] 
 Oh, yo, oh shit man, what up dunn? 
 Yo where've you been at man? 
 Yo we need you man 
 You gotta put out that knowledge 
 Kick that street knowledge G 
 Please man, you got that drugs 
 I need my fix of that dope 
 C'mon man, please man, you got it man, c'mon man 
 Prodigy: 
 Now the latest gun drive, jelly beans 
 GMT peyote, I know you feel me 
 P's song is a natural tripping me 
 My rhymes is so vivid, you start to see things 
 Way different, America's fake 
 I was fast asleep, but now I'm wid awake 
 I was under the spell of Kangol and reserved notes 
 Religion and fashion, I used to be flashy 
 Till I had a total recall, forgot what I've already knew 
 It took me 33 years for me to see the truth 
 Ever so clear I was too young 
 I couldn't articulate myself the right way son 
 But now let me break it down, pass it all around 
 This is not a theory, the conspiracy is real 
 They wanna put me in a straightjacket in a padded room 
 And tell the world is 12 monkeys so they can be confused 
 Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body 
 Secret Society trying to keep their eye on me 
 But I'm a stay incogni' in places they can't find me 
 Make my moves strategically 
 Prodigy: 
 They say life is like Chess 
 But fuck that I'm tired of playing games with you kids 
 Ain't no time for playing, check the rhymes it's insane 
 I write it for the streets, for the hood inspiration 
 Inspire every party to map where it's poverty 
 I started with a Mobb but now I got an army 
 With soldiers and troopers 
 The TV and the radio scared the death of us 
 So we hit the YouTube up 
 Now I got millions of views 
 Now watch how many rappers follow what P do 
 Now I'm too hoody to conform to the program 
 I'm too much of a rebel for me to try to fit in 
 Nigga! It don't matter on the color of your skin 
 Right now you either positive or you negative 
 I got friends in high places, multiple races 
 And coaches on my side, all you got is paper
