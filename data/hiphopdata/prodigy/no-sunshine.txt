Man, I remember growing up 
 Well, you know, living my last 5 dollars 
 I see nobody there 
 (Hook: French Montana) 
 Now I hope you fuck niggas get better 
 Stop my team no never 
 We gon' be here 
 Countin' all this cash, my niggas all in here, 
 You ain't gotta ask 
 We been ballin' all year, ooh 
 'Cause ain't no sunshine when your cheese gone 
 When your cheese gone, ooh 
 (Verse 1: French Montana) 
 Money be the root of evil 
 Hanging on the block with dirty eagle 
 Around fiends with dirty needles 
 The lawyers fee so they never keep you 
 A broken dreams what them niggas feed you 
 (Verse 2: Chinx Drugz) 
 Watch the game from the tour, that's 4 seats 
 Act like they never knew you but they all speak 
 Rain wrist, watch and chain that's a 4 piece 
 Seen murders so bad they needed 4 sheets 
 (Verse 3: Prodigy) 
 Satisfaction when I made his head spin 
 A 57 spun and made him do the backspin 
 My pipe smoke more than the crackheads 
 Biv him up to God he then high as permanent 
 (Verse 4: French Montana) 
 Ain't no sunshine when the money gone 
 Me and my wrist shinin', about 20 homes 
 Had 40 homies, about 20 gone 
 Niggas buying cars taking out 20 loans 
 (Verse 5: Chinx Drugz) 
 Hung around some millionaires and made a couple large 
 Figured Id stay around longer and make a couple Ms 
 Drunk, hissy niggas hold me while I stumble off 
 Niggas hating so hard, I need 20 tips 
 (Verse 6:Prodigy) 
 Yeah, bird niggas just food for my desert eagle 
 Eat till it's all gone, there's no running to the people 
 Nightmares, cold sweats, I'm trippin' 
 My worst fear is being broke like you, its forbidden 
 (Verse 7: French Montana) 
 Its forbidden I be in cold sittin' 
 Pole spendin' with the hustle, made a pole lift 
 A reason why your ho missin' 
 In the crib with no clothes 'cause the niggas crib for poes listed 
 40 long nose, Scott Pippen 
 Start fishin' Water blue seats 
 Top missing 
 Count money, breaking down 
 Work the same motion 
 Shark in the tank, small fish in the ocean 
 (Verse 8: Chinx Drugz) 
 Collect calls from the pens, talkin' through receivers 
 Now a nigga done blew up like hiroshima 
 Wide body, blowin' Cali, rollin' through Medina 
 'Bout 100 racks soaking in the jewellery cleaner 
 Try your hardest not to snitch 
 But you been subpoenaed 
 3 quarter chinchilla for the winter season 
 Collect calls from the pens, talking through the glass 
 'Cause I ran up in your crib, talking through a mask 
 (Verse 9: Prodigy) 
 Ferrari dirt bikes on the turn pipe 
 Dirty New York niggas, get that dough like 
 The fuck else is there to do? 
 Fuck a dumb bitch, I'm gettin' dumb rich 
 Making power moves 
 Keep my piss clean, so I never get kept 
 With parole, piss means to much to miss 
 Out here in the fast 
 You must be shittin' me 
 I'm way to champagne 
 (Hook: French Montana) 
 I hope you fuck niggas get better 
 Stop my team no never 
 You niggas gon' be here 
 Countin' all this cash, my niggas all in here, 
 You ain't gotta ask 
 Niggas been ballin' all year 
 Ain't no sunshine when your cheese gone 
 When your cheese gone, ooh 
 Uh, Oh 
 Ay, 
 You know you know who you real niggas is when you're down to your last 5 dollars and you get that 
 4 dollar nickel bag and a dozen 
 It's some nasty shit 
 On the flip side of the coin 
 You know what 
 What a real nigga is 
 When he did some real money 
 And that's how you show me how you really flip 
 Ya know what I mean? 
 Back at the end of the day 
 Lot of these niggas wasn't ballin before they started rappin' 
 And a lot of niggas started rappin' after they was ballin 
 Coke boys baby 
 From the back blocks for real
