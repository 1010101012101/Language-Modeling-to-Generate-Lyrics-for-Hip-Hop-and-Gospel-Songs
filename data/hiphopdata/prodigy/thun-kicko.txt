Prodigy 
 Yous a notebook crook with loose leaf beef 
 A backseat criminal who pass the heat 
 To somebody that blast the heat 
 Man it sound bad on the pad what happened in the street 
 A villain on the vinyl an analog outlaw 
 A lot of gats on your DAT taped southpaw 
 You thuggin' when the mics plugged in 
 Barkin through the speakers like you got no sense 
 You're wild on the 2 inch 
 Got your platinum plaques to prove it 
 Your music's been around the world movin 
 And it come right back around to the ground on it 
 Now its time to face your opponent 
 Infamous cling to this real shit 
 Stuck where we started at 
 Fuck that 
 Not because I have to we want to 
 I love this shit 
 The raw is what I live for 
 To hear the sound of the crowd roar for more 
 To see the niggas that can't pay rush the door 
 Wildin on the dance floor when they song come on 
 Swinging they fists 
 Ready for war but it's a different type of effect 
 It's not violence 
 They're just tranced by the advance 
 Tranqued by the sound bank 
 Put under the drum 
 Numbed off of our shit 
 Now who you rocking with them or us 
 Deep love or cheap lust 
 QB or bust 
 Infamous till we pass on 
 You're laughing at the wrong kid I take action 
 The fam are confidants, nigga 
 I write bombs that'll shatter your ambitions of being top dog 
 As we move through the stage floor I need to bass more 
 So I can taste it and make y'all go AWOL and lose it 
 Say no more 
 Brace your delf nigga its on 
 Cormega 
 Who tale you tellin' 
 Are you frail or felon 
 Were you makin' sounds or watchin niggas sellin 
 You exploit niggas lives in your rhymes and then avoid em 
 You never felt the moisture in the air from coke boiling 
 You never felt the razor scrapin your plate your hands achin 
 Yet you keep choppin cause there's paper to make 
 You never felt the power of invincibility 
 Clutchin a gun like fuck it dun 
 It's him or me 
 At your best you wasn't hand to hand 
 No more than 3 grams 
 What the fuck you know about a ki man 
 You never hustle 
 Let's get it right my nigga wild woulda stuck you 
 Stop dry snitchin in your rhymes listen 
 What you tryin' to do help the guys in blue 
 Indict duns so that could be another rhyme for you 
 You a parasite you never had a life 
 So you throw other niggas lives in your pad at night 
 Its clever when you write it 
 Spoken well for a dude who never been indicted 
 You know the deal motherfucker 
 The real make the fake niggas kneel 
 And lose appetites when you taste nigga's steel 
 My rhymes are what it take to get a deal 
 That make it real 
 I'm like BIG you can't replace the skill 
 I laced your ill like cocaine in scarface's grill 
 Your motherfuckin flow is basic kill 
 I'm Cor Mega raw forever 
 Y'all niggas know my steez I'm reppin for Queens 
 Your minor league I'm big time like Mark McGwire's deed 
 Your whole team is pussy 
 When I squeeze vaginas bleed 
 My lyrics they official 
 I bag up coke on dishes made of crystal 
 Your niggas they will miss you 
 My nickel plated pistol got 16 shots 
 You can take 'em with you 
 To the coffin or DAs office 
 Surgery nurses screamin we lost him 
 Life suddenly divorced and fuck it it cost him 
 You want beef say no more 
 Brace your delf nigga its on 
 We spray 4 4 s bitch
