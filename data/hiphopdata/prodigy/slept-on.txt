Hey yo, my flow burns so hot 
 I'm cooked like the coke up 
 Boy it will over scorch you, 
 Be a soldier on your frontline 
 I'm wicked with the rapping 
 The sickest nigga on the drop 
 To bitches I'm attractive 
 I make that pussy holla 
 I'm good with shit man 
 Listen to the shit I say 
 It's perignon you dog, I pop like the bubbely 
 When I was doing bad, you people was all laughs 
 Assholes, jock off, kiss my whole ass 
 Mobocracy, live by mob rules 
 If niggas don't humble, they self re eat food 
 Who possibly, could stop me, I ask 
 Perhaps nigga not knowing I be going ham 
 Mob deep coming, put your woman in the stash 
 In delict, whenever I speak it's straight cash 
 Hustle harder, go harder I mash 
 450k I made on the gas 
 They call me big time, big beats 
 Big raps, I get big chicks 
 Little rappers, they get stepped on 
 They dreams get crushed, I'm not to be slept on 
 I'm not to be slept on 
 Keep dreaming, I'm not to be slept on 
 450 killer me is on the gas 
 Got bad ass bonnie, shot gun on my left 
 Feeling like Bonnie and Clyde 
 Mallory and Mickey, she giving nigga top 
 Like she tryna giving hicky 
 She handing me the pussy like she handing me the blicky 
 Right before you curled up, on you curb sticky 
 And it's cl floated on smooth like the frisby 
 Man, what y'all niggas wanna do, you can't really 
 The boys get up but the land get bizy 
 In the mix empire state boys 
 Bright lights, dark streets, welcome to my city 
 The capital of passion girl we get spiffy 
 Mob hats counting money like the machine 
 Niggas start shit will resort to heavy metal 
 450kilometers on a pedal 
 They wanna catch me slip I move too fast 
 Internat P, check the numbers on the dash 
 They call me big time, big beats 
 Big raps, I get big chicks 
 Little rappers, they get stepped on 
 They dreams get crushed, I'm not to be slept on 
 I'm not to be slept on 
 Keep dreaming, I'm not to be slept on.
