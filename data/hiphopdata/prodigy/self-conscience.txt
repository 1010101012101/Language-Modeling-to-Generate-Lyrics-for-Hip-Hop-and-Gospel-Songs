 Yo, 
 Is it ill, do it need to be fixed? 
 (That shit is real Dunn; and stop talking like your skills don't kill) 
 Nah it's just that sometimes I feel like that 
 I can write more fouler than the last 
 (Prodigy's "Conscience") 
 Yo that shit is cash trust me Dunn; I'll never lead you astray 
 Take my word niggas want to hear how you think 
 It be that shit that you wouldn't expect to win 
 That stay playin' in they decks over and again 
 Speak your thoughts, put your all in it 
 Whatever's in your mind, spit it 
 Place your anger on the page, release tension on the tape 
 A stress verse, seem to be what they most thirst 
 Makes fake niggas disperse, they never challenge what works 
 (Prodigy) 
 Balancing the weakness, is what I specialize in 
 Dunn you my nigga cause you keep me hype when I'm writing 
 Kept me on point in the night when it might go down 
 Keep me eyes wide in the daytime as well 
 Kept me focused on what's real and nothing else 
 I find it healthy, to conversate with myself 
 I kick it with my delf (I kept you alive, all these years) 
 It's that inner voice you should of took head to and shit 
 Could have been home instead of bleeding 
 Maybe next time you'll listen when it speaks 
 (Prodigy's "Conscience") 
 Yo Dunn, I got a story to tell 
 Remember last week's mission? I told you bring the gun 
 (Yeah I remember) Nah listen, without me you'd be a memory 
 I'm the one you could come to for guidance 
 Bring you home alive when you wilding 
 Kept you out of harm's way, told you when to spray 
 Told you when it's time to put it away 
 And when the cops came, you was safe 
 (Prodigy) 
 Without question, I stay aware Dunn I'm listening 
 Every time we speak it's real, I know your intention's 
 To make sure we both safe and living, and breathing 
 You gets all respect from me Dunn, believe it 
 (Prodigy's "Conscience") 
 Yo we got kids to raise and bills to pay 
 Enemies to lay down when they stand in our way, it's only us 
 (What about the click?) Now if you die is they coming? 
 When you shot do they feel the bullet? 
 And when you broke can they fix it? All right then, you keep writing 
 And let me do the thinking, I brought us this far without mistaken 
 (Nas) 
 Voices in my head from choices that I dreaded choosing 
 Cautions I should of took head, lost in my weed, steady losing 
 Thug stripes, badges of honor, forces to succeed 
 Whores on they knees, fucking with millionaires, killers and thieves 
 I fuck until there's no feeling where, I bust and I pee 
 I lusted cars but I suffered and my scars run deep 
 I stay to myself, one deep, pray to my God 'cause he 
 Say when it's hard get on one knee, and ask Thy for forgiveness 
 Fuck the cash, the ice, the Ferrari's 
 With two-twenty on the dash when your life ain't right 
 See niggas smile up in your face and stick a knife in your back 
 Snakes shake your hand and got his dick up in your wife back 
 Why's it like that? It's life black, this is the game 
 The way I see it both bitches and niggas, is the same 
 I trust myself, I can't fuck myself 
 When hoes leave and no weed I still know me, just myself 
 Fear is weakness learn from what experience teaches 
 Beware of leaches, the vampires, my secret's 
 Never follow, cause most niggas is straight up cowards 
 Take care of my body's the temple my mind is the power
