Yo dun we got guns in the grass 
 Its three at night 
 I'm about to take the last swallow of the EZus Jesus 
 Who got fifty on the next tree 
 We gotta stop at the store 
 We need D batteries for the theme music 
 Snatch the biscuits from out the lawn 
 Fuck a cab lets take cracked out Yolanda's Saab 
 We gave that bitch two wibbles 
 And skated off the a vehicle for that pillow 
 All outside the borough dun 
 What happened to Queens like Sutphin and 121 
 Farmers and 116th 
 The got us on the BQE 
 Just to get a taste of that greenery 
 We took our smoke out to Coney Island posted up by the Himalaya 
 Pina Colada Champales mixed with Dainey 
 That's St. Ides in dun lingo 
 Spillin it on the floor for our dead people 
 While I spark the sequel 
 My niggas got lungs 
 When we smoke that shit only go around once 
 Dogs we just killin' time 
 Somebody just got they shit twist on the block fucking up the grind 
 So till it pipe down 
 We just going at the sluts 
 Bitch we wanna fuck right now 
 Cormega 
 Son I'm on a bench high eatin chicken wings and French fries 
 A crackhead fuck spent his last bucks on six dimes 
 I'm one gram from big time a spliff away from overdosin 
 My heart is broken my man started smokin' again 
 P I heard the tunnel open again 
 I spoke to Flex he said he's gonna let both of us in 
 Its time to load up the autos and semis 
 I wish my nigga Spank was in the physical form of life 
 I got my uptown Nikes thugged out and icy 
 Mad deep 
 Jumpin' out the cocaine white Jeep 
 Through with strugglin so I resume hustlin 
 Rap game or crack game my crew is still bubblin 
 Yo three in the morning and them Ds on the corner still 
 Seems we was born to kill 
 Yo P meet me on the hill 
 So we can jet through Queens in SUVs 
 And show these motherfuckers how we rep this thing 
 Ya know
