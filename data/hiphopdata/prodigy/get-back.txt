(Prodigy) 
 Know sometimes you just got to show niggas how you do things 
 That shit hurt, time will tell like my nigga iller G always said 
 I love all my niggas, I swear cross my heart hope to die (all right) 
 Hear me out, put a bullet in your mind 
 (Prodigy) 
 Yo son they caught me from the blind side me the Pee 
 The one who spread love, me I never shit on my peeps 
 I never left my dogs out in the cold 
 I extended my hand with compassion, you extended yours in war 
 Cool fuck it, why y'all snakey mother fuckers 
 Gonna learn how this nigga rock quiet storm niggas 
 Leave you shot for dead, nigga I'll rot your flesh 
 By myself come for delf and just pop your head 
 Now have a good night you snake skin bastard 
 See you at the crossroads fagot 
 And in the mean time and in between time 
 Pee will be laid up with more shines, more dollars for more nines 
 More boxes of talons to put in your spine 
 You cross me nigga you lost your mind 
 Scratch that you never knew from the start 
 So I forgive you, after you die skirmish, shots burneth 
 (Chorus: Prodigy) 
 Son the get back, is so sweet 
 The taste of revenge your blood on the street 
 It's called payback for that shit you pulled 
 I don't respect your gangsta my guns explode 
 Son the get back (yeah), is so sweet 
 The taste of revenge your blood on the street 
 It's called payback for that shit you did 
 Two wrongs don't make it right, it make it even bitch! 
 (Ammo) 
 Son we chose life fast, and niggas kept stunting 
 Had to show our ass straight up explode right fast 
 It sounds cold but we roll like that 
 Ripping rats finished off our path, we was close like that 
 All them nights that we threw back yak 
 Who would thought he do me like that straight leave me flat 
 Niggas ain't never feed me black, want to see me clap 
 Blood filling up the cement crack 
 Straight snakes and I resent that I fall back try to prevent that 
 Try not to be bent at, foul atmosphere 
 Stunning what's happening here 
 Got me 'bout to dumb out dumping out Macs in here 
 Niggas catch a hot one, fucking with Am this year 
 Wet every man in here vengeance lost my senses 
 Why y'all start quarrels I end it 
 And show up at your wake full of sorrow pretending 
 To blend in 
 (Tragedy Khadafi) 
 Yo I blow holes in moschinos, splash niggas in they mink ?stoles? 
 Down to their Kenneth Coles, fuck model bitches center fold 
 Never love a hoe, you got guns let it go my nigga let it blow 
 And what had killed you is what you don't know 
 It's two-five goodfellas getting dough 
 Yo my mom chose dope made love to the needle 
 I caught 'em fucking numerous times and turned evil 
 Back in '89 you can say I'm trapped in time 
 Still thirsty like a little nigga dying to shine 
 Baby moms said I got issues, too many problems 
 I rock timbs till my socks turn orange 
 Do a nigga dirty, relate to the unworthy 
 A young G with Q-T and black shirty 
 I've been nice since lee pin stripes and British knights 
 Fore' building razor tag and sword fights 
 Niggas see the light when they start losing pints 
 You can die by the gun or the knife 
 And I'm nice with both, coming at me with the wrong approach 
 Don't make me Arab neck tie your throat, you bitch nigga!
