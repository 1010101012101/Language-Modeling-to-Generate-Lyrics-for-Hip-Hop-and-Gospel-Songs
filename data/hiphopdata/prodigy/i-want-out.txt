I was just tellin', "Have these youngin's is over wildin'?" 
 Two shootin's in two days and none of it over dollars 
 Have my mind zoned, somewhere in a different time zone 
 Y'all can stand under building, I'm tryin' to buy homes 
 But I ponder it gradually grab me back 
 You can put me anywhere in the world and I'll adapt 
 (Look) 
 I'm tired of flyin' to label reps 
 Ike my niggas all ready to eat the table's set 
 I'm tired of corner standing, piffin' the same exit 
 Keep it real, I want hills my ninja, change settings 
 I want a backyard where pookie can play 
 I don't care if it cost my life nigga shoot me today 
 Remember going to the store, momma told me to keep the change 
 I wanna jump in something new, tell my momma to keep the range 
 My man got shot I had to peddle him home 
 He couldn't take the pain and caught a heroin Jones 
 This is it I want out 
 This usually part of the movie where the pistol comes out 
 Like I said I need change 
 I need a whole lot of this money and little bit of fame 
 It's like a ghetto tell tales 
 I'm tired of camouflagin' the corner let me get the next sale 
 I'm really tryin' to prosper of a good good rap 
 Before I leave out the hood, I take a good look back 
 They say, what don't kill you will kid, it'll only make you stronger 
 And the wrong mistake is a half dead ass doing the coroner 
 Heavenly father I'm lookin' into the heavens 
 My girl think I'm going crazy, this nigga going 7th 
 These days you know the hammer under the pillow 
 Got a mansion left from the ghetto I'm trapped in the middle 
 So niggas laid flat like soda without the fizzle 
 When it rained it poured be lucky it only drizzled 
 Took my homie under my 'brella I took him in 
 He bit me turned around and told me that's how a snake wins 
 The world we livin' in can't trust a homie far as I can shoot a nigga 
 Leave me the shit get lonely, homie 
 Don't speak my name if you don't know me 
 Most important you black the bitches dat shits is corny 
 Out ya rabid ass mind tryin' to run up on me 
 Don't make have to shoot you with the 40 
 Yo, Thunn, I be right back, yeah, hold it down G's 
 While I'm gone get me songs all over the streets 
 That's what you call awareness, these niggas put they lil' albums out 
 But nobody cares, it's P time to shine 
 Get dat shit the fuck outta here I satisfy the custi's 
 My history at retail is outstanding 
 My CD got wings 'cause it flies off the shelves 
 While I'm stuck in the bing for the next 80 days 
 Fuck it I got years it can't get no worse than it already is 
 I spoke to my nigga, yayo, the other day 
 He told me everybody bumpin' H.N.I.C., part 2 
 And on the youtube, I'm killin' 'em out there, crazy views 
 I make a rapper run for his life and drop a gem 
 This nigga threw his watch so we would stop chasin' him 
 He lucky I was on trial, I woulda stabbed him 
 He was saw from every angle all them cameras 
 Fuck it, I still won, still undefeated 
 This nigga tryin' to act like he did something, beat it 
 You're not a gangsta, it's been proven 
 Nah, you just a snitch like Frank Lucas 
 Yous a false prophet out in the world 
 While a real nigga like me trapped in a cell
