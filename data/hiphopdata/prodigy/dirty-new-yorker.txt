(Talking: Prodigy) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 Yeah... 
 Prodigy: 
 Baby mama let's roll, here we go, Cheerio, cereal 
 Killa with the flow and the blow and the dro' 
 And the gun go ring, hit 'em all in a row 
 AK-47, .40-glock, .44, let 'em know from the door 
 How it go, it's not a joke, there's gon' be a homicide 
 I'm a ride, I'm a rep me a nigga up in the box 
 And send 'em to his folks, his bloods, his kin 
 The drama it don't end, bust a gun 
 Bust a nigga's face open with the hand 
 Tell 'em go tell a friend, tell a cop, tell the FEDS 
 I don't give a mothafuck, you niggas in the Ps 
 I'm a let the world see you, you're a bitch, you're a snitch 
 I'm a Mobb Deep gangsta, Infamous soldier 
 If you got a cold heart then my shit just froze over 
 Range Rover, Chevy Suburban, the bullet proof trim 
 The windows on the crib, bullet proof them 
 (Chorus x2: Prodigy) 
 You're fucking with a Dirty New Yorker 
 Quens in this bitch fall back or get roped up 
 You're fucking with a Dirty New Yorker 
 Quens mothafucka, move and get smoked up 
 Prodigy: 
 Ay' baby mama let's slide on the floor 
 I'm a pro with the flow 
 I can go on forever tell me when to stop yo 
 My first album Head Nigga in Charge it went gold 
 With my next shit I'm just trying to seel a lil mo' 
 I won't be mad if it's less, I'm still filthy rich 
 We going on a permanent tour and never coming back 
 I'm a vet not a pet, you gon' see when I flip 
 Niggas trip fall on their face and bust their own shit 
 Come for me you gon' run up to a wall of cement 
 Certain niggas not to be touched and I'm one of 'em 
 Pop to bub me, crack open the Goose and the Gin 
 You gon' get real fucked up in memory of them 
 I'm a cop some more ice, houses and whips 
 Why they mad? 'Cause they can't spend money like this 
 180 on the wrist, 190 on the six-speed 
 Porsche with the turbo and shatter proof tenth 
 (Chorus x2: Prodigy)
