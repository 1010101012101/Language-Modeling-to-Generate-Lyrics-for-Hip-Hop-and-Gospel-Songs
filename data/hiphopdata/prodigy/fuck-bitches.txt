Prodigy: 
 Yeah live from the Massacre Tour 
 And I'm gettin' at all y'all bitches 
 Alot of y'all bitches is real silly 
 Fuck that I'm gettin' at all y'all bitches anyway 
 Till I find the right one 
 That work with me 
 You understand what I'm sayin'? 
 Fuck that I could book you a flight baby 
 (Verse 1: Prodigy) 
 Tiffany out in Connecticut, now that's a bad bitch 
 I told her I could make her whole lifestyle switch 
 She in love with my Turbo 911 Porsche 
 But some niggas she fucked with got her brain lost 
 Must be out of her mind for turnin' me down 
 Told the bitch "Look look what you doin' right now" 
 Just roll with me probably overseas 
 And you ain't never in your life got to worry about gees 
 Got this one nigga's wife this nigga a cop 
 He had kids with the bitch now the bitch on stuff 
 I could only see her on every third weekend 
 Bitch I'm gone should've left the kids with him 
 Its 'gon be one lucky bitch on the planet 
 To see my plan and want to take advantage 
 Bitch better get it while she could still have it 
 Cause me and Christina Milian gettin' married 
 And if that bitch front still stuck off Nick Cannon 
 Then me and Lindsay Lohan 'gon shock the planet 
 I need me a million dollar bitch that's hood 
 And if not I take a regular bitch that looks good 
 (Chorus: Prodigy) 
 You should fuck with me I'll take you to different time zones 
 Different countries and area codes 
 Introduce you to the new free world 
 But you rather fuck him and be stuck in the hood girl 
 You should fuck with me I'll take you to different time zones 
 Different countries and area codes 
 Introduce you to the new free world 
 But you rather fuck him and be stuck over there girl
