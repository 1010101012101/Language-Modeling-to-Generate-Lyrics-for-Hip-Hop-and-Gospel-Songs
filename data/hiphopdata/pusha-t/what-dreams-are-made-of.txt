(Ric Flair speech) 
 To all hustlas with the same interest 
 Bow your heads as the Lord's mentioned 
 Prayer service held in the kitchen 
 I wish they never found Jimmy Henchmen 
 I'm what dreams are made of 
 Cocaine Ronald gave us 
 Then Nancy tried to save us 
 By that time we had Motorola pagers 
 Now we push button start motors 
 Yacht owners, you small ballin', that's Pop Warner 
 Menage a trois in the bath house 
 Blew money on 'em, bitches never bad mouth 
 You glass slipper bad whores, I just cash out 
 You open doors, I open jaws and pass out 
 Luxury is just my lifestyle 
 I'm Scott free with a million dollar bright smile 
 You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it 
 The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it 
 I'm what dreams are made of 
 I'm what dreams are made of 
 Sell that pussy to me, I'd rather buy it baby 
 Look at ya purse you need the help, you can't deny it baby 
 I'm what dreams are made of 
 I'm what dreams are made of 
 Yeah, Louboutins under sweats 
 A hundred just landed from responding to a text 
 Niggas talk money but I'm still unimpressed 
 When these thousand dollar sneakers got me feeling underdressed 
 Hip Hop bores me, hustlers applaud me 
 Too much school boy, not enough rude boy 
 Nothing match the feeling of pulling up in that new toy 
 And it ain't even half of my safe, tuck like the Jew boy 
 Bentley with the rag-top yarmulke 
 It says kilometers all on my speedometer 
 Cocaine under my tongue like thermometer 
 I got the fever, I never took a breather 
 Need a way out like Nas needed an Ether 
 Like Mike Vick chased by PETA 
 More pony hairs, more zebras 
 More pythons, more lizards
