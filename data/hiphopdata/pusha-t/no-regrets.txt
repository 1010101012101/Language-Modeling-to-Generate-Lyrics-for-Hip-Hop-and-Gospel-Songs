Kevin Cossom: 
 Yeah 
 Uh yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way) 
 Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all" 
 Wasting time, I can't get that back (Can't get that back) 
 Uh, so everyday I go hard 
 Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas 
 Came from making real figures (Too much money) 
 Nothing less, no regrets 
 (Let's get it) No-no, no regrets, ah 
 Pusha T: 
 Say hi to the bad guy, say ah to the champagne 
 Got a call from my jail niggas, said I'm doing my damn thing 
 Woo, they see I'm doing my damn thing 
 Magazines, videos, they ain't missing a damn thing 
 Nowadays I sell hope, what you rather I sell dope? 
 What I sell is a lifestyle, naked bitches on sailboats 
 Foreign cars on a freight train for every nigga they railroad 
 Rent-a-cars we road run, money longer than train smoke 
 I done been in that same boat, I ain't letting this chain go 
 Representing my niggas down till they free 'em like Django 
 It's the same old, just the same old 
 How the game go, where the pain go, where the blame go 
 My mind wanders on a PJ, my mama brought up in the PJs 
 In the club sippin' P&J on the same arm as my Piaget, woo 
 If I leave today, throw the keys away 
 But I'mma live today, I wanna see tomorrow, I wanna lead the way, ow

 Jeezy: 
 Mama had me in the ghetto, I was raised in the slums 
 Every hero got theme music, guess I need me some drums 
 Bought me a five for fifty, I bust 'em down, it was jumps 
 Trying to be fresh as forces, I swear they white as new ones 
 Streets taught us, streets raised us, had it less determined 
 Dodging jackers, dodging murders, federal to state pen 
 Uncle got power, now I see him in another ten 
 We was set up just to lose, Lord know we trying to win 
 In the pursuit of this power, this masterpiece to the hour 
 You know it's platinum and waterproof, wear this bitch in the shower 
 Yeah, we want finer things, plus a plug in the scale 
 Yeah, them plates shining like diamond rings at back can't you tell? 
 In the hood I'm a king, King Arthur to the people 
 Except he got his on a chariot, I got mine in a Regal 
 Sportcars, Italian leather, Princess Cut, with baguettes 
 Law of physics say them nines weigh more when they wet, no regrets

 Pusha T: 
 Presidential I came back, April showers I rains back 
 Jumped ahead like June something, still I'm wheeling that Maybach 
 Tom Ford with my braids back, Tom Ford and my shades black 
 Dope boy with a cape on, super-sizing that beige back 
 All white like Gotti said, Ye told me I'm outta here 
 Mentioned Ye two years ago, yeah, I got that by the square 
 Woo, and you could buy a pair, twenty or more and we'll fly 'em there 
 How you acting like I'm ain't here? D-boy and I pioneer
