(Pusha T) 
 It's like an itch you can't scratch 
 It's like a bitch you can't shake 
 I still want it 
 Sleeping with the finest 
 The thread count is bindless 
 Security blanket of cocaine, I am Linus 
 In this climate I'm Kareem Burke tied in 
 The Roc silent partner I ain't throwing up the diamond 
 Throwin' on the sherwin, collars up, bottles up 
 Sparkles to the table, got 'em feeling like he's Merlin 
 Whirlwind, powder makes your World spin 
 Learn from OG?s, Alpha Romeo's and Sterling 
 Updated that, upgraded that 
 Suffocation blue, in the inside's potato sacks 
 Yeah, talk money, I'm made of that 
 Cocaine parties, like the 70's I cater that 
 You know what fame is? 
 Sittin' with the women of your dreams and forgettin? what her name is 
 You know what pain is? 
 Flushing 2 bricks and have a n-gga try to strain it out the drainage 
 See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo 
 I still wanna sell kilo's 
 It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the rico 
 I still wanna sell kilo's 
 Searching for the fish scale like I'm tryna find Nemo 
 I still wanna sell kilo's 
 That's what happen's when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito 
 I still wanna sell kilo's 
 (Rick Ross) 
 Grew up watching momma car repoed 
 A little n-gga staring through the peep hole 
 How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there 
 Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared 
 Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets 
 When we talking business, talking on the phone cease 
 Feds listening to conversations through my own star 
 Piecing puzzles together solving homocides? 
 Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out 
 Red Velour, I'm in the white glass house 
 Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale 
 Fiddling dope a real n-gga sell yayo 
 Everyday a n-gga dies than we can't ask why 
 Show 'em all love, the bitches f-cked on the side 
 Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church 
 Rolls Royce called ?, trunk full of work 
 See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo 
 I still wanna sell kilo's 
 It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the rico 
 I still wanna sell kilo's 
 Searching for the fish scale like I'm tryna find Nemo 
 I still wanna sell kilo's 
 That's what happen's when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito 
 I still wanna sell kilo's 
 (Ab Liva) 
 Testarossa top models, G4?s, Gucci pass the crease off 
 Everything I climb in, I win 
 Richer male, ?, remarkable timing 
 Black label everything, logo's in the lining 
 Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head 
 Powder smoke clears through the walking dead 
 The Rose bottles pour for the Champions 
 You think it was a Grammy win 
 Celebration spills through the morning like an ambion 
 Bithces love my ambience 
 Chain swinging, ticker taping like it's Mardi Gras 
 Thousand n-ggas deep, never needed body guards 
 Thousands keys that I'm about to do pilates on 
 Where the Kings crowned like the grill a Maserati's on 
 Candy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper 
 Blew a fuse and caught a body on 
 Cocaine storaging 
 Liva living dreams, ya DeLoreans pouring in
