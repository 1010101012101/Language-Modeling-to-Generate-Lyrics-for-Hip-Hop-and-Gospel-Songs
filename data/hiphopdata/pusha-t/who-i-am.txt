Kwes: 
 Our feet are trottin' broken glass 
 Don't forget 
 Pusha T: 
 Woo, they said be all you can be 
 Woo, they said be all you can be 
 I just wanna buy another Rollie, I just wanna pop another band 
 I just wanna sell dope forever, I just wanna be who I am 
 Woo, they said be all you can be, nigga 
 Woo, they said be all you can be 
 Always knew I could rule the world, let's define what my world is 
 Knee deep in this dope money, damn near where my world ends 
 Same block, same rock, I was thinking 'bout murdering 
 I ain't getting my hands dirty, let you worry 'bout serving 'em 
 Yeah, they said be all you can be, woo, they said be all you can be 
 I just wanna buy another Rollie, I just wanna pop another band 
 I just wanna sell dope forever, I just wanna be who I am 
 Woo, they said be all you can be, nigga 
 Woo, they said the truth set you free 
 2Chainz: 
 Entrepreneur, strip club connoisseur 
 Hot fudge sundae, pour it on you hallelujah 
 Pour it on you hallelujah, pour it on you hallelujah 
 And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you, ah 
 Red, white, blue, I pledge allegiance to the street life 
 Even if it's leftovers I still got to eat right 
 Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite 
 She popping her jeans tight, all day I dream about sex, three stripes 
 We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room 
 Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool 
 Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool 
 Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool 
 We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room 
 Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool 
 Pusha T:

 Big Sean: 
 Pretty girls is my reputation, one on my arm, that's decoration 
 Getting to it, no hesitation, to fuck with me you need a reservation 
 To the top escalating, elevating, good music legislation, delegatin' 
 And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation 
 And I'm going till I KO, eyes closed, I'm okay 
 All my bitches know they roll even when we role-play 
 My homie got that nine on him, all night and all day and all night and all day 
 And all night like that shit's his motherfuckin' soulmate 
 'Cause no time for hand in hand when you got this paper hand in hand 
 Bitch I'm feeling like a grown-ass little boy, nigga na na na na na 
 Bitch I'm feeling like a grown-ass little boy, 'cause I still love to get pampered 
 But don't get it twisted, watch your step and fuckin' manners
