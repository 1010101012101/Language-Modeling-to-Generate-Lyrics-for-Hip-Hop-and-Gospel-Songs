(Intro: Young Jeezy) 
 In the midst of negativity 
 A positive sight can be blurred 
 And the visions that we thought were good 
 Seems to let evil occur 
 While still possessing our human form 
 We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born 
 And as we bow our heads at night, rich, wealthy 
 Or poor with dislike, we pray, asking for 
 Forgiveness for our sinful ways 
 With mind, body, spirit and faith, we pray amen 
 (Kanye West) 
 You like that don't you? I wrote it myself by the way 
 And I don't mean to be selfish 
 But I picture myself getting paid 
 And you might catch pneumonia 
 'Cause I'm colder than a elf on a sleigh 
 Me and Pusha back on it 
 Now everybody help us pray 
 Lord forgive my sins and all my friends 
 Dollars make sense, I'm trying to get paid 
 (Pusha T) 
 Try to get saved (too late!) 
 Time to get paid 
 Got a gun and a stocking mask 
 Niggas thought I was trying to get waves 
 I'mma let all y'all niggas pray for it 
 My young niggas knocking off a K for it 
 Sold my soul on the back-end 
 Only fucking way I'mma pay for it 
 Front that shit, you put a flame on 
 My niggas locked in a cage for 
 They keep telling me to go hard 
 #1 spot you was made for 
 I made more 
 Front of the grill, got a racehorse 
 California Crayola red 
 Glow In The Dark like a Ye tour 
 Fuck niggas stepping in my lane for 
 Not knowing that it's a land mine 
 Soon as a nigga feels a cool breeze 
 Throw the top up like a gang sign 
 Red or blue? Crip or Blood? 
 Solitaires, diamond studs like chandeliers I'mma flood 
 Black Jesus piece like it's dipped in mud 
 Fashion God's, notice mine 
 Rollarball spikes I'm Pokemon 
 Paris shit, Louboutin 
 Under bright lights where do you belong 
 Please Lord, yeah, it's gettin' realer everyday 
 Niggas killin', niggas starving, niggas they can't find no Yay 
 See at first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay 
 So some be trappin' and some be dying, bow heads and let us pray 
 Amen 
 (Kanye West) 
 Amen, how many people do you know hatin'? 
 On your downfall sitting their waitin' 
 When you shine, don't know what they gonna say then 
 Everything I do now stadiums 
 Tell me what they really gon' say to him 
 And I'm headed straight to the ATM 
 Finna go HAM, nigga, finna go in 
 Nigga you get it when pigs fly 
 When Yeezy fake, Devil's pie 
 Piece of cake, Kit-Kat 
 I need a break, God's child 
 Jesus Christ, Club like a broken neck 
 I need the ice, I need the lights 
 In Egypt they fightin' for freedom 
 Cop pull you over no reason, beat him 
 (Young Jeezy) 
 I got them units packed in 
 That black van like the A-Team 
 Even seen them come 2-tone like a saleen 
 Saleen, Yeah that's a Mustang 
 Break 'em down in the night, that's what I call hustling 
 They say they want that dumb shit, well this is ignorant 
 Condo on the timepiece, now that's ignorant 
 Young, you a fool, I coulda bought some real estate 
 Instead I bought a half a block, I tried to sew up half the streets 
 I'm on, 75-75, going for the 25 
 Guess who's pickin' up a trey 
 Just an ordinary day with extraodinary pay 
 Extraordinary risk 
 Can't even explain, got an extraordinary wrist 
 I talk it 'cause I lived it man, this shit ain't really nothin' to me 
 Tell ya like Sosa told Tony: "don't you fuck with me"
