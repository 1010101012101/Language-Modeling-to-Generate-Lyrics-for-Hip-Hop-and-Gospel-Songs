Money on my mind, money on my mind 
 You see, the only real money is fast money 
 And with these niggers walk around with, that's little flash money 
 Baby don't buy it 
 I know he's a ? player, but he's not gonna spend it 
 He's been put for much too long, so trust me 
 They thought I lay dead, I was playing pass'em 
 Spot me everywhere with the 8 like king goslin 
 Niggers think they sit at the top, they just pasturing 
 Now they hid their head like an ostrich 
 Optimist prime and they go wing 
 Feeling like I transform niggers still hands on 
 Whip me like a sandstorm, had the ? to sell it in a damn prom 
 Get you higher angelo, the author of this ant thumbs 
 Your punch lines are mere jabs, they see through 
 Like the clip glass on that coup... pass 
 Money on my mind like my pillow is a vault 
 You niggers is soft so when that pillow's where you talk 
 Can't fight it in them dealers, actresses on mattresses 
 Your real chance to loving you bachelors, I laugh at them 
 Don't you know that it's money over bitches 
 Bitches love money, I granting them 3 wishes push 
 Shout out my nigger don c, aka jivon ? don c, 
 Didn't even know that you got an aka digit, ahaha 
 Always in that fly shit, mike t, warrup? bring it 
 Or should I say in a national ? marcus paw, refresh, yeah 
 The fear of gods in these motherfuckers 
 You can act like don't hear this shit man 
 Niggers ain't fucking with me man, no games, yeah.
