Look at my situation, I couldn't ask for more 
 I'm the real Situation, I should be on Jersey Shore 
 Look what that kilo sent me 
 That Porsche is keyless entry 
 That girl is high and drunk I swear the rest is elementary 
 We found a superfreak, no, she won't know what hit her 
 I'm on my Rick James, minus the beads and glitter 
 You've got to beg my pardon, this shit here is money talking 
 You don't get good dick to often, I'mma have you funny walking 
 See that shit I pull up parking, make your neck snap the f-ck off it 
 Damn, too late you lost it, back to that world you lost in 
 Back to that world you lost in
