Op open your open your eyes, 
 Look up to the skies and see 
 I'm just a poor boy! 
 Open your eyes 
 Look up to the skies and see 
 I'm just a poor boy! 
 Open your eyes, 
 Look up to the skies and see 
 I'm just a poor boy! 
 Seeing is believing, believe when you see it 
 They saying I'm the best, sh-t, I'm just trying to be it 
 They tie me to a mountain of it, I just try to ski it 
 Long distance wireless Kinect like I Wii it 
 W, double I, spelled so you could see it 
 'Cause it's way over their heads when I Ray Allen 3 it 
 I'm Rondo on the Bongos, when giving you my convo 
 We ain't been home since you was snatched out The Congo 
 Toast to progress as I'm staring out my condo 
 Made it this far and I ain't never been a tonto 
 EEUUGHKK!, as you compare me to a f-cking rookie 
 You can't respect the new school when you played Hookie 
 Cooked white turn to tan, so the world is snooky 
 School of Hard Knocks, look at where the game took me! 
 To the limit like Montana with better grammar 
 Bigger homes, with bigger guns and better cameras. 
 Open your, open your eyes, 
 Look up to the skies and see 
 I'm just a poor boy! 
 I've never pitched a penny in a wishing well, never! 
 I laid it all on a fishing scale! Yes! 
 And in April it hung from a kitchen nail 
 Straight from my memoirs as I kiss and tell 
 Big faces like Rushmore, touch more 
 Flash and trail blazer transcend us, look to us for 
 The next mission when the tie dries up 
 With no inner vision yet they eyes wide shut! 
 Fifteen years of ducking spies like us 
 Confidential informers disguise like us 
 Jail doesn't resignate with guys like us 
 Told Wesley at the Oscars to slide like us 
 Didn't listen so prison is what they did to him 
 I'm counting, unscathed millions is what they hear through him 
 Same principles you must have heard 
 Lohan's get the breaks, the T.I.'s, we just stare through them... 
 Open your, open your eyes, 
 Look up to the skies and see 
 I'm just a poor boy!
