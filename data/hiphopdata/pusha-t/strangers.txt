 All you do is complain 
 I buy you this, I take you there, now you wanna act like it ain't fair, 
 Find a new love guess it ain't rare, You can be replaced 'case you ain't clear 
 Yup, OK player, look to my side and you ain't there 
 Too little time and you ain't share, end of the road and you ain't there 
 You hit my cell on Friday, come pick you up outta your place 
 You tell me I look beautiful, baby that's so unusual 
 But then we get to the party, you act like you don't even know me 
 You laughin' it up, you takin' shots, so drunk you forgot about the girl you brought 
 You're a fool, you're a damn fool and it's all you'll ever be 
 So get a clue, get a damn clue 
 You'll never find another me 
 Na na ooh 
 Don't treat me like a stranger 
 Don't treat me like a stranger 
 Na na ooh 
 Don't treat me like a stranger 
 Don't treat me like a stranger 
 I can't believe how you do me, actin' like you never knew me 
 I let your love run through me, I feel just like a groupie, Charlie's hooptie 
 Perfect strangers, serving goodbyes like a waiter 
 I'll pack my bags alligator, I hit the road like a stone and roll see ya later 
 You're a fool, you're a damn fool, all that's all you'll ever be 
 You're a fool, you're a damn fool and it's all you'll ever be 
 So get a clue, get a damn clue 
 You'll never find another me 
 Na na ooh

 Don't treat me like a stranger 
 Na na ooh 
 Don't treat me like a stranger 
 Don't treat me like a stranger 
 Thought that life you was made for, they say you get what you pay for 
 Want no stress so I paid more, now you wanna talk while I game on 
 I play on, baller-like, goya bags lu vuitton and spikes 
 Take no bags when I board the flight, where I land I'ma score tonight 
 Let pour tonight ciroc and lime, now we both stuck like a porcupine 
 Let's get lost so we hard to find, push it to the limit like borderline 
 Na na ooh 
 Don't treat me like a stranger 
 Don't treat me like a stranger 
 Na na ooh 
 Don't treat me like a stranger 
 Don't treat me like a stranger
