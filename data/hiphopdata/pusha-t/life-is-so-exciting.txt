It's the life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 South beach, spent time there, off shores my time wear 
 Whole crew got they own watch, nigga we ain't buying no time shares 
 The lifestyle, too fly, my new bitch is getting next flighted 
 I'd say I'm back to the old me, but my old bitches would get excited 
 Ain't going back, I'm stepping forward, don't test me, been prepping for it 
 Got no time for that hating shit, my young niggas got weapons for it 
 Got Chief Keefs that ain't Chop, that bang-bang, that blocker 
 And all you niggas is blockers, change your name to Ibaka 
 Shit real, shit been real and shit just get realer 
 I'm showing bitches my car keys then ask them what's the dealer 
 Ain't saying that's your girl, ain't saying shit like prank callers 
 'Cause it's a small world and hoes make it even smaller 
 It's the life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 It's beach weather over here, nigga, sky's clear, nigga 
 That's flip flops, that's Americana, that's Hilfiger 
 Yacht masters at the yacht party, sitting at the dock is a drop 'rari 
 That's pole position with a joystick, that's push a button that's like Atari 
 Raising the bar, no parallel, so many horses, carousel 
 How we roll out like a caravan, ghost in the snow, see Carol Ann 
 Maryland, tags on it, heroine, bags on it 
 Hermes, throw pillows, Missoni couch and it clash on it 
 Take a look in my viewfinder and see seven figures and two commas 
 I see bad bitches, see blue diamonds, I see-saws, I two time em' 
 Gigolo, juggle hoes, jigsaw, I puzzle those 
 Cross words, cross birds, I cross country with a couple those 
 It's the life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 When the sun is out we runs about 
 Let the world see what these hunneds' about 
 Ain't seen this since the one was out 
 With Jay, Pimp C, and Bun 
 We out here, still pimping that big 
 Looking that jig, someone go call hype Willie 
 We need slow mo, more rolls more 
 Niggas is drunk and type silly 
 We dancing like Dame, holding up chains 
 Got PMBs on a big ass boat on molly, rolling up Jane 
 This life is so exciting, that money be so inviting 
 So fuck what they're indicting, tell my lawyers keep on fighting 
 For the life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 Baby life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting 
 The life, the life, the life is so exciting
