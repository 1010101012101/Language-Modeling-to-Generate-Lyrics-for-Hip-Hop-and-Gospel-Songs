I'm feelin' myself, ... more cuff and I might take off 
 Things like haters never take a night off 
 But you know I'ma tell them that they can get lost 
 'Cause I'm feelin' myself, it's my world 
 I'm spending money like a rich white girl 
 I'm go ball like I'm 7 feet tall 
 I don't know about ya, but I'ma get off, 'cause I'm feelin' myself 
 Oh, what a feelin', the champagne is spilling 
 All this dirty money got me bathed in them millions 
 Came out ... from the days of my dealing 
 The driver of that car was a ... 
 Still up on my nino, smelling like a kilo 
 But I'm down and fresh soft white like my pillow 
 Feelin' myself so ... like we know 
 Cross that line and get shot like a free drove 
 Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas 
 Under bright lights, middle finger to you haters 
 In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl 
 We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feelin' myself 
 I'm feelin' myself, ... more cuff and I might take off 
 Things like haters never take a night off 
 But you know I'ma tell them that they can get lost 
 'Cause I'm feelin' myself, it's my world 
 I'm spending money like a rich white girl 
 I'm go ball like I'm 7 feet tall 
 I don't know about ya, but I'ma get off, 'cause I'm feelin' myself 
 Baby take your chance, never mind what you're hearing 
 I can change your life tell me what are you comparing 
 Put you on the red carpet tell them what you're wearing 
 Shop till you drop they say sharing is caring 
 More's in my winnings, we can share opinions, like baby steps 
 We can share ...walk before you run, but she so independent 
 And I could see us fly, the sky is the limit 
 We so real, got my own quarter mill 
 Counting money on the bed, watching dealer no deals 
 In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl 
 We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feelin' myself 
 I'm feelin' myself, ... more cuff and I might take off 
 Things like haters never take a night off 
 But you know I'ma tell them that they can get lost 
 'Cause I'm feelin' myself, it's my world 
 I'm spending money like a rich white girl 
 I'm go ball like I'm 7 feet tall 
 I don't know about ya, but I'ma get off, 'cause I'm feelin' myself 
 I propose a toast to every living kingpin 
 Smart enough to dedicate their work to their wing man 
 Keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling hand 
 Play my cards right, now I'm looking at a dream hand 
 Yeah, got you looking at my poker face 
 No joker see it, you can call me smoking ace 
 In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl 
 We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feelin' myself 
 I'm feelin' myself, ... more cuff and I might take off 
 Things like haters never take a night off 
 But you know I'ma tell them that they can get lost 
 'Cause I'm feelin' myself, it's my world.
