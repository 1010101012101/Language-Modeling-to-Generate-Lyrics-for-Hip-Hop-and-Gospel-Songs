Y'all don't really know, 
 They don't really know, 
 Y'all don't really know, 
 They don't really know, 
 Y'all don't really know, 
 They don't really know, 
 Check it, 
 Sky's the limit so I'm reaching for the stars, 
 I'm tired of being that n-gga that they keep behind bars (bars) 
 What's good, you got it, I'ma take yours, 
 I'm hood, f-ck a gun, I break jaws, 
 Understood, its nothing to bang for the cause, 
 And I should 'cause you frontin' bang with the force, 
 Rats playin' in the walls, cats playin' in the halls, 
 But n-ggas know after a certain hour stay indoors, 
 'Cause I'm not responsible for what I might do, 
 Or what might happen if dog come through 
 Its gon' be a problem 'cause man if I catch 'em I'ma rob em, 
 Pleeeease somebody stop em, 
 But for that it's too late, I gotta eat, 
 You ain't, you straight, 
 I ain't gon take it all... today! 
 You can say what you want but cha know the truth, 
 X is a beast in the streets and the booth. 
 (Chrous) 
 (Busta Rhymes - Verse 2) 
 See all of them rinky dink Mr softy rap, I'm here to kill it 
 Reinstate the boom bang and make you n-ggas feel it 
 And most these n-ggas fear it. 
 Let me pop it off and blam it 
 And how we smash it out like you watching animal planet 
 Now let the sun load the bricks off 
 N-ggas pissed off 
 The stage too crowded throw the bitch off 
 I'm bout to turrn the switch off, to the goons I hand pick em 
 And they burrrrrrr stick em, ha ha ha stick 'em (whoa) 
 You better tuck in your shine, that's prime grind 
 Niggas is black, them kill 'em in black 
 Now feel us one time, see how we got 'em following suit 
 Fall in one line till we force these n-ggas to scatter 
 Soon as I buss rhyme 
 Bust Rhymes, constantly fulfilling them with heat 
 Like an oil spill in the street 
 See how we killin' em 
 Peep how we drill 'em in the head with a case load 
 And bang em 
 (Hang em) 
 Beast on the track like Wolverine (rine) 
 Imma pitbull but got wolves on the team (team) 
 It ain't what it seems (seems) 
 Don't get it twisted (man) 
 Imma let you know just in case y'all missed it (f-ggot) 
 Got me f-cked up if you thought that I fell off (come on) 
 Now n-ggas wanna ride d-ck get the hell off, 
 Come on Chulo, we both know you culo, 
 I know and you know that you the one that you knows, 
 Beefing for real, n-gga I sleep with the steel, 
 And keep sh-t real, I creep sh-t still, 
 Ain't nothing changed but the date and the year, 
 N-ggas make threats yet they wait for a year, 
 (Chorus - repeated) 
 (End)
