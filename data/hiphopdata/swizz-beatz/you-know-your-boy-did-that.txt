 Hold up, lets talk about it be about it man 
 Ya got a lil paper and you think you all front, but it all means nothin' to me

 I was livin' wit my lil bitch for a week 
 The bitch kicked me out, I'm at my other bitches house 
 These bitches wanna walk and wanna fuck when I'm at they house I got my gat and my snub, and my rubber glove 
 Quick to bust nigga 'cause they ain't no love 
 Ain't no handshakes, and no hugs 
 The city I'm from is nothin' but thugs {talk to me, talk to me} 
 You know the boy did that

 Took the hard street ?? and I did that {yep} 
 It all started from a little corner drink I turned that thing into a million dollar steam 
 Yeah, you know the boy did that 
 I bought my first car I didn't know where to live at 
 But I got a little smarter 
 Got my peep game up and worked a little harder {woo!} 
 Then I flipped the game and then i 
 Raised the bar and then I raised my name 
 And then I raised my price then I did that right 
 Now I'm 96 million, ain't that right?
