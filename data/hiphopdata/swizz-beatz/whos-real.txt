(Chorus: Swizz Beatz) 
 Hes phony hes fake that's the type of people hate hey hey hey jada jada! [Repeat: x2] 
 If your real and you no it clap your hands [Repeat: x2] 
 Wait a minute whose real whose not? she's real but hes not. 
 If your real and you no it clap your hands 
 (Jadakiss) 
 Yeah yo gun go clap pack on move 
 Blood getting draw skin gonna bruise 
 Real gone win, fake gone lose love over power 
 They hatin' by twos 
 All they left is they yellow tape in they shoes 
 Its real in the funeral waiting to make news 
 Load the tre pound so we six up on 'em 
 We just switch up on 'em 
 Whose phony whose fake? 
 Silver hummer on eights 
 Lifes good I'm straight claps your hands 
 One time and relate 
 Can't keep it 100 
 Cause 1's I hate but I'ma keep it 200 
 Cause ones they fake red and black cars red chrome skates 
 Young juice lane on my blades 
 Yeah yo pocket full of cash 
 Wallet full of plastic 
 In and outa lane dipping through the traffic 
 We ain't hustling no more 
 We doing gymnastics 
 Couple of flips then stash it bastard 
 Real going recognize 
 Real going recognize real 
 Phony going recognize steel 
 I recon I will 
 Expose those who are 
 If you ain't you all 
 I don't go to far 
 Sorry muah 
 Get your self a fresh flesh wound 
 Or a new scar 
 Bullet holes on the side of your new car 
 Load up the AR spray all 
 OK y'all heads real on this side phony where ever they are 
 Woo! Hey!
