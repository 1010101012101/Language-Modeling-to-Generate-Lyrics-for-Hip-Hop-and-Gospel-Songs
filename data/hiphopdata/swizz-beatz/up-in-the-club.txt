 (She said she'll take it all off, up in this club...) and I told her 
 Don't stop get it get it, Don't stop get it, get it (2x) 
 I'm something like a phenonmenon, The steering wheel cost a mil' that my arm is on 
 I don't tell no time so my time is wrong, I just use for something, for diamonds on 
 Listen, pull up to the club, make the whole club stop, now go to the floor and make the whole club drop 
 And tell the DJ, I ain't never gone stop, and this thing here you ain't never gon cop, listen 
 Peek-a-boo when I'm peekin' at you, In them Victoria Secrets, that I'm seeing through 
 You say that's your girlfriend, so you eatin' her too, you say you want more fun, then meet my crew 
 (Bounce) 
 (She wants to take it all off, up in this club..) and I told her 
 Don't stop get it, get it, Don't stop get it, get it (2x)- 2x 
 I am, up in the club, my liquors in here, my cars in the club, 'cause I don't really care 
 My dogs in the air, 'cause we up in here, here, here, oh yeah 
 Sittin' in the back I got 10 stacks on lap, She said this thing look like the grill of a cadillac 
 No, that's just the way my money stack, yeah now girl can you make your ass clap 
 (Rock) My swagger's crazy, she got her ass up, like can I have your baby 
 I sat her ass down like na girl is you crazy, get your hand out my pocket, you get's no gravy

 (She want to take it all off, up in the club..) and I told her 
 She feelin' herself, but without me that feelin's unfelt, 
 She get loose she losing her belt, She get loose she losing herself 
 Drink that drink before the ice melt, and she don't want no water, she ain't mike phelps 
 I'm like baby how could I help, and she go and tell her friends how good I felt 
 (She want to take it all off, up in the club... hey hey... and I told her 
 Bridge (out)
