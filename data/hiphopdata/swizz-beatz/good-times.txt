I get high, I get high, I get high, I get high 
 I get high, I get high, I get high, I get high 
 I get high on your memory 
 High on your memory, high on your memory 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high, high 
 Everyday I need an ounce and a half 
 S.P., the only flower that you know, with a bounce in a half 
 Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash 
 So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave 
 I get high 'cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around 
 It take a blunt just to ease the pain that humbled me now 
 And I'd rather roll somethin' up, 'cause if I'm sober, dog 
 I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up 
 I get high as a kite, I'm in the zone, all alone 
 Motherfucker case, I'm dyin' tonight 
 So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could 
 You got beef with Styles P, I come to splatter the hood 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high, high 
 Aiyyo, I smoke like a chimney 
 Matter of fact I smoke like a gun when a killer see his enemy 
 I smoke like Bob Marley did, add to that 
 That I smoke like the hippies did back in the 70's 
 Spit with the finishin' touch, get this, that 
 I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch 
 I get high like the birds and the planes 
 I get high when bullets hit faces after words exchanged 
 I get a rush off the blood on the walls, you understand? 
 Like the M-5 pedal when it's touchin' the floor 
 I get high 'cause fuck it, what's better to do? 
 And I'ma never give a fuck, that's right 'cause I'm better than you 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high, high 
 I'ma smoke till my lungs collapse, I'm from a era where 
 Niggaz 'cause terror over guns and crack 
 Where a dollar bill is powerful, I smoke weed 'cause 
 Time seem precious and I know what a hour do 
 High for a livin', gots to ride for a livin' 
 With my real gangsta niggaz that'll die for a livin' 
 Shit, I get as high as I could, 'cause if you see things 
 Like I see things that I'ma die in the hood 
 Motherfucker, understand it's full service to you 
 I don't smoke the weed if it ain't purple or blue 
 And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die 
 This is S.P., dump it in you, bitch, I get high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high 
 I get high, high, high, high
