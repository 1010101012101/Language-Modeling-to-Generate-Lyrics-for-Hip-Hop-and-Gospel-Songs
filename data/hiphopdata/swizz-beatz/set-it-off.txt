 Ayyo, ridin' with my burner, rollin' with my earner 
 L.I.E. Expressway bangin' that Uncle Murda 
 Bullet, bullet, I rep New York to the fullest, fullest 
 I got guns, don't think I won't pull it, pull it 
 Gat off safety, dudes won't face me 
 Both of them hoes like, Cagney and Lacey 
 And N.O.R.E., yep, I'm respected in the projects 
 Filled out my O.G. card, it's in the process 
 I used to get a pass, now I give a pass, ha 
 And got a gun that go rah like summer splash 
 Thug club music that you listen to late 
 Yep, that's that style that I helped create, tell 'em Swizz

 Aiyyo we got the patron, hennesey, cranberry and vodka 
 Mami down for takin' on poppa 
 Opa locka, where I buy that 
 No heroin, cocaine, no, I never try that 
 I just fly pass, thinkin' 'bout, gettin' a bypass 
 Surgery, stomach and small ass 
 Bitches with small ass, go tell your managers 
 N.O.R.E.'s in the building with keys they call me janitors 
 Go hard, sort a feel like a slave 
 And even on the block when it rain like meter maids 
 'Cause I heard that Peter paid Paul from a jena maid 
 But if he didn't pay me, he would see the grave 
 Set it off in this mother, mother, mother, jump it off

 Good grippy, that's all I expect 
 Now I'm a set it off like I'm Ron Artest 
 Now who you with hey we the best but this ain't Khaled 
 This your boy J. Russ from Palm Beach 
 Let the boy set it off with them big choppers 
 And you can have it your way like a fuckin' whopper 
 Or matter of fact nigga pop a double sack 
 Two for twenty five you be rollin' like a cadillac 
 It's for them big guns that have your ass jumpin' back 
 It's time to set it off nigga where the money at?
