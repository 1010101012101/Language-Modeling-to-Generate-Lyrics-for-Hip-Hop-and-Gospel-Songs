(Viva La Vida plays...) 
 (Swizz Beatz) 
 Swizzy! 
 U know... I'm just feeling real good 
 I woke up this morning and said 
 I wanna be like erm... You know! 
 Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, I'm Try'na Get That Oprah (x4) 
 (Repeats "Oprah" x13) 
 Verse 1 [Swizzy] 
 Lamborghini's, no Gallardo's 
 Riding round, full throttle 
 Murcielago's, Look at my lights 
 God damn they look like goggles 
 She, she look like a model 
 I travel far, Mami 
 I'm in Dubai, Abu-Dhabi with Bugatti's Mama! 
 Verse 2 [Swizzy] 
 Red Enzo, A Million bucks 
 Look at my seats boy, They sewn like a tux 
 Louis this and Gucci that 
 That's, That's on my back 
 My Paper this, My paper that 
 Why you think that they looking like that? 
 (Viva La Vida plays) 
 (Swizzy) 
 You know when they, when they know you got the paper 
 They be looking real funny 
 (Where they at x3) 
 They wanna pull out a black card 
 I'ma pull out a golden express card on 'em 
 Fly on 'em 'cause 
 (Chorus (minus Oprah x13)) 
 Verse 3 [Swizzy] 
 Bill Gates, Steve Jobs 
 IPhones, Microsoft 
 My paper is very long, your paper is very soft 
 I am a big BOSS 
 Boy, get lost 
 My new Basquiat 
 H.O.V know what that cost 
 (Viva La Vida plays) 
 (Swizzy) 
 We just having fun 
 It's like New York got all scared and got all serious 
 It's like we can't make no fun records no more 
 You dig? I'm here! 
 10 years in, I can do what I want now 
 Who's on the phone? 
 Ya know what I mean (Who?) 
 Tell 'em I'll call 'em back (Ya know what I mean!) 
 That Oprah, That Oprah 
 That Steve Jobs and Bill Gates 
 That Oprah, That Oprah 
 That Steve and that Billy Gates
