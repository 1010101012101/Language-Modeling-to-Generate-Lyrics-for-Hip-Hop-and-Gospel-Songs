(Feat. Cassidy) 
 Come An' 
 Come 
 Come 
 Come An' Get Me 
 (x4) 
 While I'm up in the ghetto I'm watchin' it closely 
 My whip is butter for the bread they want to toast me 
 Gold windows on my whip it go up slowly (?) 
 'Cause I'm young an' I'm rich an' bitches want me 
 An' them haters I shake 'em off me 
 Them Antiques on my ass them shits costly 
 I got cream niggas think I'm Mr. Softy 
 To the goons I blow 'em off me 
 See niggas be buyin' the magazines an' readin' the articles an talkin' 'bout the paper I got 
 But niggas don't know all the pain an all the struggle I've been through to get to all the shit that I got 
 Come N' Get Me! 
 (Verse 2: Cassidy) 
 Ay-Yo The numbah one spot vacant an' I got eligibility 
 Put me on your song if you want street credibility 
 My label think I got crossover ability 
 But I Ain't fake niggas ain't goin' Milli Vanilli me 
 Not guilty your boy's out the facility 
 An' if you niggas want it with me 
 Then COME N' GET ME 
 Y'all don't want it with the barbarians runnin' with me 
 You Clap I Clap back If I die then you comin' with me 
 Now I'm With Swizzy you dig me 
 Cause your boy is squeeze (?) 
 But they ain't even worth the lawyer fees, Please 
 Them dirty ass niggas still coppin' quarter keys 
 They roll half a pound 
 I'm laughing now 
 I'm the Hustla Muthafucka betta ask around 
 I seen niggas in Philly then call 'em up an' ask 'em now 
 I'm Flashin' now the top on the askin now (?) 
 If you was hatin' before you goin' hate me with a passion now 
 If Cops around I want everybody to stop 
 You know listenin' to the monsta of hip hop 
 Man I Probably mad your favorite rapper hot 
 I'm Comfortable in the middle fuck the top 
 Come N' Get me if you want a big hook or a big beat 
 Your now tuned in to the sound of the Swizz Beatz 
 An' I Ain't considered a rapper I don't care bout my flow 
 I'm Hot an' Sleek with the dough 
 Come N' Get Me!
