 I won't ever trick out giving you the facts 
 There will never be any need to dispute 
 Whether or not I'm telling the truth, 'cause I am 
 And I ain't got a thing to hide, no 
 Despite my reputation, yeah 
 Even though it's the world that I live in, 
 You know that I'm with you 
 So, what you wanna know girl I'll reply 
 You'll get everything tell I ain't gonna lie 
 As long as you can promise you do the same 
 Girl I will tell you everything, you confess me anything 
 Who I'm with? Even if it happens to be some other chick 
 It's only business babe so things don't need to trip 
 Baby you can come too see it's whatever you like, you can choose, oh girl 
 'Cause I ain't got a thing to hide, no 
 Despite my reputation, oh 
 Even though it's the world that I live in,

 Music please, let me clear my throat 
 Slippers and the robe while we own that boat 
 Matching ?, that sound dope 
 Came from Aspen we riding in the Aston 
 Martin baby, with the margello tops 
 Don't worry about it cause a mere small bucks 
 Five minutes like I have you superstar status 
 Ten minutes like I can have you global status 
 Born, express, don't worry about nothing I got the rest 
 And that other dude is old now, let the music touch your soul 
 Living, get a little more comfortable, I win it 
 So keep the drummer to yourself just quit it, yeah 
 I'm way too close, I'm way too close, so I leave you alone 
 What you wanna know girl I'll reply 
 You'll get everything tell I ain't gonna lie 
 As long as you can promise you do the same 
 Girl I will tell you everything, you confess me anything 
 Take every piece of information 
 See you can have it all, girl, I ain't gonna front 
 As long as you can promise you do the same 
 Girl I will tell you everything, you can ask me anything, anything
