It's showtime! 
 Everyday, they ask how I'm doin' 
 Deuces up playboy I'm coolin 
 I'm coolin 
 I'm coolin coolin, I'm coolin coolin 
 I'm just coolin 
 I'm coolin coolin, I'm coolin coolin 
 Everyday, they ask how I'm feelin' 
 You see the ounces playboy I'm chillin' 
 I'm chillin' 
 I'm chillin' chillin', I'm chillin' chillin' 
 I'm just chillin' 
 I'm chillin' chillin', I'm chillin' chillin' 
 (Verse 1 - Swizz Beatz) 
 I got my Balmain on 
 Plus my Louis on 
 I got my Christian on 
 Boy I get this on 
 You see me ridin' Lotus and my top b-tch gone 
 The interior butter like popcorn 
 She got on Givenchy, she fresh like me 
 Everytime she go shoppin' Alexander McQueen 
 I mean, we just coolin on a Sunday 
 Can't wait to ball out on Monday 
 My Jaeger-LeCoultre is out ya culture 
 The hoods on fire man them boys is vultures 
 We are family la kostra nostra 
 Go through up and downs like a roller coaster 
 Ay! Got my cavi- with them gators on 'em 
 I'm in the studio fogging with some faders on em 
 And this beat is my entree 
 I'm Audi three thousand, Andre 
 (Verse 3 - Eve) 
 Evey E, I'm back on my bullsh-t 
 Came back, came back, back with a full clip 
 Who want problem, wah- wah- wah-, who want flip 
 Gun taste, one lick, wanna get some of this 
 You see that hot pink Birken, that's a problem 
 I'm hot like everything kickin I'm a problem 
 Yeah, I'm a walking bow 
 You might talk a lil one but ya looks are oh 
 (Outro - Swizz Beatz)

 Do ya dance now (x2) 
 Get down now (x4) 
 Lets work now (x4)
