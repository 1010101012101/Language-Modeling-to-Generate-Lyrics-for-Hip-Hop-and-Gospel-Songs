Remix 
 Now, niggas salute me, bitches salute me 
 The block salute me, the hood salute me 
 You should salute me, they should salute me 
 So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfuckin? general 
 Niggas salute me, bitches salute me 
 The block salute me, the hood salute me 
 You should salute me, they should salute me 
 So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfuckin? general 
 Yo Esco's illin?, Swizz Beatz illin? 
 What more can we say? Stop grillin? 
 'Fore you get hit up, shot up good 
 We'll murk you in your hood 
 I'm El Patreno, Nas the God, you lose your life 
 Whether on the corner or clubs, I'm shootin? dice 
 Break my cipha, I'll make it at you, slice you 
 Knife you, stab you, shank you, splat ya 
 Too many rappers is jealous, who be gassin? the fellows 
 Bunch of actors who never sold a crack in the ghetto 
 Went from Nas to The Esco, back to nasty 
 Clappin? that black heat 
 None of y'all are matchin' my level, I'm the general 
 Niggas salute me, bitches salute me 
 The block salute me, the hood salute me 
 You should salute me, they should salute me 
 So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfuckin? general 
 Niggas salute me, bitches salute me 
 The block salute me, the hood salute me 
 You should salute me, they should salute me 
 So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfuckin? general 
 Nowadays, I'm on some mack shit 
 But I used to be loyal to tax, cracks 
 The nigga that would soil in your jacks 
 Feed 'em with trays the size of light bulbs 
 Coke so bright, it shine like white gold 
 And the hoes like Joe way before this rap shit 
 Before the Versace floors and the Rolls to match it 
 Joe's a bastard, I sell pussy for cheap 
 Make my bitch walk the strip with no shoes on her feet 
 Don't front for me, you kids is not ballin? 
 If you is then why is your wiz on my dick like I'm Jordan? 
 Ties swollen for no man with bold plans 
 Sick of this rap shit, why? Listen to ?Slow Jams? 
 I'm a grown man, the talk of the strip 
 Niggas think I'm Kev Childs that way I boss the fifth 
 Dogs, you's a bitch, I'm here to bring you a muzzle 
 Saying I'm peepin?, I'ma bring you a muzzle 
 Get the point, general 
 Niggas salute me, bitches salute me 
 The block salute me, the hood salute me 
 You should salute me, they should salute me 
 So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfuckin? general 
 Niggas salute me, bitches salute me 
 The block salute me, the hood salute me 
 You should salute me, they should salute me 
 So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfuckin? general 
 It's Cassidy, I get rock like a boat when you go fishin? 
 Ayo, listen, I'm the general like Tso Shim Shin 
 I'm so sick, you can tell by the expression on my face 
 That I'll get in that ass like preparation H 
 The weapon on the waist and I spray guns off 
 'Cause if it's beef, I'ma be on top of it like A-1 sauce 
 Pause, now who the truth? Me, who quick to shoot? Me 
 My four-fifth got kick like Bruce Lee 
 See, I'm a true G, hotter than soup be 
 Raw like sushi, you gotta salute me 
 You dudes see, I'll put in an order for you 
 I'll let the water boil, cook a quarter to the oil 
 I had it for sell but y'all fagots would tell 
 Go to jail and start singin' like Patti LaBelle 
 I ain't gon? back in a cell, you rat and you did 
 Fuck a vest, put a bulletproof hat on your head 
 When I'm clappin? the lead, I'll murder a nigga 
 And if he say he not the feds, then I'm servin' the nigga 
 I'm thirsty for the change, playin' games ain't a issue now 
 A bitch would give you AIDS nowadays if she kiss you now 
 I got that coke and that haze on my gristle now 
 We goin' to war, you gonna need more than a pistol now 
 They throwin' missiles ?round, you still tryin' to get a nine? 
 Uh, it's the last days, end of time 
 The terrorists jackin? planes, sendin? bombs to the Pentagon 
 They off the hook like intercoms 
 We just had a bad wintertime 
 So you know they gonna start to rob 
 And steal for a mil? when it's dinnertime 
 You still spendin? time focusin? on dumb shit 
 On the block smokin' but you broken on some bum shit 
 What the hell? You might as well put a suit and tie on 
 Jump in a casket and get ya die on
