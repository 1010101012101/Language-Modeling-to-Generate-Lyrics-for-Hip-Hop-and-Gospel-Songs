Chillin' in my Beemer, listenin' to "Ether" 
 Bumpin through ya speakers, know I got the heaters 
 Rockin' don't stop, I get the rockin' don't stop 
 I'm bangin' 'em beats, you know I like that hip hop, stop 
 Freeze 
 You know who it is, it's me, bitches! 
 Smoke good, eat good, drink good, fuck good 
 Come into the club stuntin li-ike you should 
 My shit on fire I don't need no gasolina 
 I'm comin' through your block with the deuce 2 seater 
 Ring the alarm, man, call me the sand man 
 When I drop beats, I'm the one man band man 
 Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M 
 Get the money, dolla dolla bills y'all (fuck em) 
 Freeze 
 You know who it is, it's me, bitches! 
 Vida loco, flyin' through popo 
 See me in that 4 door, that Bentley esporta 
 Benz all lethal, my rims so lethal 
 You front, I'mma I'ma shoot that ass like a free throw 
 Sniffin that yayo, trying to be Sosa 
 Trying to act tough when that's some black chocha 
 I ain't gotta shoot ya, I could just choke ya 
 You trying to make dollar, I could just show ya 
 Freeze 
 You know who it is... it's me, bitches! 
 Chillin' in my Beamer, listenin' to "Ether" 
 Bumpin' through ya speakers, know I got the heaters 
 Rockin' don't stop, I get the rockin' don't stop 
 I'm bangin' 'em beats, you know I like that hip hop, stop 
 Freeze 
 You know who it is, it's me, bitches!
