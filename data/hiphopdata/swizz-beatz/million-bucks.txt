 Hey hey oh hey 
 Maino 
 Hey Swizz 
 I think I woke up on the right side of the bed 
 That's how I feel 
 I think I might give away a million bucks 
 I think might give away a brand new truck 
 'Cause I feel good 
 Yeah I feel good 
 'Cause I feel good 
 I think I might take a lot of shopping sprees 
 You in the club goddamn all drinks on me 
 'Cause I feel good 
 Yeah I feel good 
 'Cause I feel good 
 Hey 
 Maino 
 Good Lord look what a beautiful day 
 My enimes gone ain't here they gone away 
 I feel good 
 Everything is ok 
 I feel like givin' all my money away 
 Cause niggas is broke ain't no bread in the hood 
 Look what they did they sellin Feds in the hood 
 I ain't going to change I'm coming back through the hood 
 Do what I do and then back to the hood 
 I'm blessed I went places I never been 
 I lived to see a black president 
 I'm good, yes I feel good 
 Drinks on me baby what's good! 
 For the ones who got more than 1 mouth to feed 
 Gas so high got em' riding on E 
 Daddy needs shoes and kids gotta eat 
 They can have every last Penney on me 
 Me and swizzy rollin' in the lambo 
 Sit back reminiscing this and when I never had no 
 Dollas, pride is well poor dear mama 
 Stuck to the fight like a drained out boxer 
 So I know what it feels like to not have much 
 I should give away what I made last month 
 I gotta a lot to feel good about 
 I think I'm gonna give away a good amount 
 One shot for my niggas in the state pen 
 Two shots for my niggas still hustling (ra) 
 I feel good 
 I'm so good 
 Man I rose from the bottom and it feels good 
 Swizz 
 Man I'm a introduce to you a new dance (new dance) 
 It's called the money dance (echo) 
 You pull the money out your pocket like this (like this) 
 You put your hands in the air like this (like this) 
 And you simply just um. 
 Bounce throw it all around 
 (Throw) throw it all around 
 (Throw) throw it all around 
 (Throw) throw it all around 
 A little more now 
 Throw it all around 
 A little more now 
 Throw it all around
