(Chorus - Swizz Beatz) 
 Do you wanna fly, could you be my co-pilot, pilot 
 You said you wanna fly 
 Do you wanna fly, could you be my co-pilot, pilot 
 I'll take you up in the air 
 I'll take you out again 
 (Junior Reid) 
 Did you ever try making love to your girl in the sky 
 Champagne fly, high grade, so high 
 Have you ever tried making love to your girl in the sky 
 (Have you ever tried making love to your girl in the sky) 
 (Swizz Beatz - Verse 1) 
 Baby girl we are going, going, gone 
 That cloud, we are floating, floating on 
 Sit back and put your seat belt, seat belt on 
 I'm the Pilot, you my Co so let's get it on 
 I can take you on shopping spree's across the world 
 Everybody in the world know that you are my girl 
 I 
 ll blow that marijuana tree straight up in the air 
 I walk around 'cause I don't care 
 I got that change in my pocket switch to heavy metal 
 That black card let you know I am out the ghetto 
 Never forget the ghetto 'cause I love the ghetto 
 I'm in that Porsche GT I am touching metal 
 (Snoop Dogg- Verse 2) 
 Come fly the friendly skies, it's like a piece of pie 
 It's a story, amore?, look in my eyes 
 Now fasten your seatbelt and crack the moon 
 You like that? Well like that, now write back 
 Got too, now rock two now pop two 
 Shake it and bake it, take it all 
 Roll with me baby doll, we can see the universe 
 Do things that you like 
 Fly you in a jet and have you watching Satellites 
 You ever done that? 
 Show you where the fun at 
 I do that, you knew that 
 I run that, now come back 
 Hold that, now roll that 
 We bossed up in another dimension 
 Before you rool Dogg, get ya parents permission 
 We out 
 (Swizz Beatz - Verse 3) 
 S-N double O-P is down with me 
 Plus he blowin' them Chronic trees I'm listening to D-R-E 
 Some people say the weed could save ya 
 That's why they roll it up in Bible paper 
 Cruising down the highway it's about that time 
 To smoke some good weed so I can blow my mind 
 I ain't doing crimes, why the police always wanna f-ck with me 
 One time (one time), two times (two times) 
 (Weed break) 
 Inhale exhale, exhale inhale 
 You know we love the way the good weed smell 
 So so... 
 (Junior Reid) 
 She never forget, she getting love in a private jet 
 She never forget, she getting love in a private jet
