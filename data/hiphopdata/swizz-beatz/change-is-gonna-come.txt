(Sam Cooke and DMX) 
 I was born by the river in a little tent 
 Oh and just like the river I've been running ever since 
 It's been a long, a long time coming 
 But I know a change gonna come, oh yes it will 
 Change gon come 
 Ch-ch-ch-ch-change gon come 
 Ch-ch-ch-ch-change gon come 
 Ch-ch-ch-ch-change gon come 
 Ch-ch-ch-ch-change gon come 
 Ch-ch-ch-ch-change gon come 
 Ch-ch-ch-ch-change gon come 
 (DMX - Verse 1) 
 Man, shit slipped through the cracks 
 I flipped through the tracks 
 Lay it in the studio, flip through the wax 
 It's time to bring the dark to the light 
 Change gon come but not without a fight 
 N-ggas say one thing than do another 
 Stab me in the back but say you my brother 
 Sh-t ain't the same no more, it's different 
 Eh, eh, eh, eh man f-ck all the riffing 
 I got a point to prove and moves to make 
 Knew for a long time you dudes was fake 
 I know a muthaf-cking snake when I see one 
 They look like one and move like one 
 So you gotta be one 
 (DMX - Verse 2) 
 Man, I played this game, then played that one 
 Fell for a minute but bounced right back son 
 Can't hold down the dog for long 
 Change gon come, that's the name of the song 
 You know what it is, cause you knew what it was 
 Let a n-gga go, I'ma do what it does 
 N-ggas sellin' they soul just to get a buzz 
 I f-cks with you blood, I f-cks with you 'cause 
 I'm out that (?) that's built for war 
 BFW, kickin' in the door 
 We don't take no for an answer 
 I'ma go hard 'cause I have to 
 Pull guard? and I'ma clap ya 
 (DMX - Verse 3) 
 Man, n-ggas get so caught up in their bullshit 
 They don't know what's going on around them 
 Fake n-ggas I found them 
 Industry's moving in a different direction 
 Kinda like a bitch with an erection 
 N-ggas been phoney for so long 
 Actin' like they know me for so long 
 Time for cats to roll on 
 Here's new writing on the wall 
 I can't f-ck with you for real 
 I can't f-ck with you at all
