Owwww... (yeah) 
 Yeah, we did it (it's on fire) 
 Yeah, we did it (we are ready to rock this) 
 Yeah, we did it (uh uh, ye got Metallica in here) 
 Yeah, we did it (Ja Rule, Swiss the monster) 
 Let's go: 
 Just when you thought it was over 
 Just when you thought it was done 
 Just when you thought it was safe now... 
 We did it, did it again 
 We did it, did it again 
 Fast cars, fast broads 
 'Cause I'm a rock and roll star, baby 
 Born in the USA 
 I'm gonna hit the highway 
 On my harley 
 Do about thirty-eight 
 Nothin' else but take it easy 
 Any woman what won't please me 
 I'll give her up 
 Anything that won't touch me or move me, I'll give it up 
 And I know you're all serious 
 We did it, did it again 
 [James:] More than this, nevermore, you whipping boy 
 [Ja Rule:] Yeah...(louder) 
 [James:] More than this, nevermore, you whipping boy 
 [Ja Rule:] (scream) 
 [Ja Rule:] Let's go... 
 Just when you thought it was over 
 Just when you thought it was done 
 Just when you thought it was safe now... 
 We did it, did it again 
 Just when you thought it was over 
 Just when you thought it was done 
 Just when you thought it was safe now... 
 We did it, did it again 
 Who loves a little rock and roll mixed with a little bit hip hop soul? 
 We do 
 Come on and rock steady 
 We'll keep you rockin', get ready and say 
 We did it, we did it again 
 Believe in the air you breathin' in 
 I'm a mad work freak 
 With a freaky weekend 
 No matter what you spend 
 Because you're just livin' it up 
 And damn, we're gonna do it again 
 Come on, you better bring some friends 
 We having a party tonight 
 I'm bringing juice and gin 
 You'll beat your head 
 (Swiss) We did it, did it again 
 [James:] More than this, nevermore, you whipping boy 
 [Ja Rule:] Scream 
 [Ja Rule:] Yeah we did it...(louder) 
 [James:] More than this, nevermore, you whipping boy 
 [Ja Rule:] (Yeah we did it) 
 [Ja Rule:] Let's go... 
 [Ja Rule:] Just when you thought it was over, just when you thought it was done 
 [James:] Rip that smile right off your face 
 Fast cars, fast broads 
 'Cause I'm a rock and roll star, baby 
 Born in the USA 
 Highway 
 Harley 
 (Kirk: Kill 'em) 
 Who loves a little rock and roll mixed with a little bit hip hop soul? 
 We do, we do 
 Break it down
