A story for my gangster girls 
 Mija wants to be a gangster 
 She wanna roll wit the thugs 
 The barrio is all she loves 
 She wanna hang wit the g's 
 Tour the big city of the 63 
 I met her late back in 88 when mija didn't bang she had her hale 
 Straight I know her pops was a police maybe thatz why she didn't 
 Hang wit the homiez maybe a couple times babygirl kicked it 
 Gangster life style I think she digged it 
 Bunch of cholos and back yard jutas 
 Gettin' down and dirty wit the judas 
 Throwin' up placasos on enemies street 
 Mija pepped it all it was some desest 
 Brain washed the girl now she dropped out of class 
 Hangin' out in the lane where the world moves fast 
 Mija gots a gun but don√¢t know how to shoot it 
 Till she took her first cruise on a drive by shootin 
 5 enemigos on the corner smokin' she send them all to 
 Heaven no jokin

 Tour the big city of the 63 
 She likes to roll wit the homiez 
 She a straight up killa 
 She showed it 
 I respect her like a queen 
 Na mean 
 Mija gotta be on the scene 
 We had a conversation about filiation 
 Talked about dying and a carseration 
 She had stories about her down's and up's 
 What we wanted to be when we both grow up 
 We took a cruise to the beach one time and 
 That's when I know that dis chola was mine 
 Tattoo my name on her titie mijas crazy 
 Said she always be my lady 
 She had my back like a real soldado 
 She never did a vato gacho 
 Cruising down the stripe jamming oldie hits 
 And that's when we got in some shit damn 
 It was a good varrio the mothafucka's she gun down 
 What goes around comes around 2 bullets to her head 
 And 12 to her stomach vatos got nothing nothing

 Serio homies it was some gacho shit 
 Mija looked me in the eye's homies 
 And that was it tried to wake her up 
 Babygirl come on then I realize 
 That my ruka was gone 
 Juda lights flashing so a vato dashed 
 To my carto wit a ak stash 
 All the cuete waiting for the noche 
 Me and my gun an a lower monte 
 Suicied crew on the way to the action 
 Out of nowhere juda lights start flashing 
 Fuck it homies I shooted out wit the cops 
 Ain't to fuckin' way hell this vato gonna stop 
 Hit the skina jumped on my ride let my tony montana 
 Take this vato lives it felt good to watch them levas drop 
 Now its time to face the cops and her pops 
 Then her jefe ames the straps so in the middle of the street 
 I ame right back I took the bullet to the throat 
 I couldn't shot her jefe back that's all she wrote
