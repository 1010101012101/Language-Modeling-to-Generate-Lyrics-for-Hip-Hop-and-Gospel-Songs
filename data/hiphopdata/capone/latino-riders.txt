On my block 
 It gets hot 
 My raza riders man 
 Some get stuck 
 Some get shot 
 My gente bangin' fo life 
 We don't got 
 We know guns 
 We got here getting new ones 
 On my block 
 It gets hot 
 Latinos ride till we die 
 My hood man 
 It's all eses 
 Tattoo with the three's and the x's 
 Out in chi 
 Whole different thing 
 It's all conejo's, disipline's and kings 
 In detroit latin counts roll deep 
 Sureno soldiers banging on the streets 
 It gets thick with the dudes and the chicks 
 They all out here empyting the clips 
 Verna street full of gangsters and rollers 
 San antonio straight up soldiers 
 My sanferos gon roll on the canyon 
 Youngsters and pee wees loading up the cannons 
 Ben davis up, dickies sagging 
 The only thing red on my block is a wagon 
 Fuck with us man you gonna see some action 
 Thank god every day that I'm a mother fuckin' latin 
 No chump change leavethe big dough 
 Graduated from shake to the indo 
 A Mexican never know what he in fo 
 Move through the hood in a six fo 
 Narco corridos 
 Yeah we bang that 
 Vatos shoot us 
 We bang back 
 Hermosas at a show 
 We bang that 
 Little homie where you from 
 Where your gang at 
 Southwest detriot where I hang at 
 All the real rap shit yo I sang that 
 See me on the bronx with my wercos 
 Mexicanos, columbianos y mantecos 
 Down in Texas we all caballeros 
 All paisanos whipping on the cuervos 
 Dos x's y modelo get plastered 
 Drop enemigos in a casket
