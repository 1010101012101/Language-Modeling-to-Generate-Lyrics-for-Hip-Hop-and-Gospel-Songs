Quadraports, slide off through a time warp 
 Been getting money before dinosaur 
 Dimes is on Llamas is long 
 Write rhymes on island resorts 
 Dimes who snort, some guys who slide a line inside a Newport 
 Push a fly two door like Too $hort 
 I'm just a artist with a tech, hard as a beget 
 Carve a nigga head 
 You a meatball, get squeezed on 
 Your physical being turn to cream corn 
 Slice a quarter for the order, 
 Supporter, roll dice on the corner 
 Gats tucked, big cash can touch 'em at the cusp 
 Couple of hundred racks on the rug 
 Young don, son's under the arm 
 He treat Lamborghinis like bumper cars 
 Got scars 
 Chains around the necks like scarves 
 Your limbs hang out of threads like yarn 
 I'm the next big thing 
 Chickenheads cling the bed spring king 
 Run the ring, my head is on the top of the pyramids 
 Pictures of me and all of my affiliates 
 We lit phillies like idiots, kill a lineage 
 Let them know what it really is 
 Niggas is penniless with skinny ribs 
 I fire semis in too many wigs 
 I'm feeling like Billy the Kidd, skinny big 
 You literally live as a guinea pig 
 If the timbs ain't on deck 
 You know the pennies is 
 Your fingers still penny pinch 
 You make me pull a mack milli out the Fendi trench 
 At any event, hold the twelve gauge that's heavy as shit 
 For every clip we let steadily rip, 
 Push your afro back to Seventy Six, motherfucker 
 Niggas is petty, legendary 
 All of my enemies are dead and buried 
 I let twenty hit your strawberry Pelle 
 Burn holes in your belly like Henny 
 Betty, turn up dead like Freddy 
 For owing niggas fetti 
 Get cut with the machete 
 Lift you up quick with the desy 
 Smuggle drugs stuffed in the teddy 
 Your bitch get fucked, missionary 
 Visionary, I bust shots out, the tinted end daddy 
 Ghetto poet 
 Four up in the rodent look bloated 
 You shouldn't've gloated, I unloaded 
 I was molded to stand up 
 When other niggas folded 
 The spirit out your body just floated 
 Word to my son, I'll murder a bum 
 Turn your thumb, until it swell up like plum 
 Your future look glum 
 I heard I feel numb, I'm numb when guns 
 Bang on you like steel drums, spill blood 
 Plus sweat before I lift the iron up, stretch 
 Clutch the tec, bust till your wet heads rubberneck 
 Like, "Damn, what a fucking mess." 
 Who want come test or unimpressed 
 Make you undress 
 To eat food like I'm underfed 
 Dump with the Feds, like I'm on the dead 
 With one in the head 
 Don't let it be left unsaid
