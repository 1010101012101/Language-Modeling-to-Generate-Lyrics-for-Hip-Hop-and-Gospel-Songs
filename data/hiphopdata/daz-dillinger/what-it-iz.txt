What it is nephew ya know 
 Yeah, touchdown on this suckas man 
 From all angles of the game and let these fools know 
 We ridin', we mobbing, we hogging, we dogging, we flossing and balling 
 So what it iz 
 (Daz Dillinger Chorus 2x) 
 What it iz, I thought we was down to end 
 My best of friends try to mash me and do me again 
 What it iz, I thought we was down to end 
 What it iz 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Forever coping cash, be on the mash with my business 
 Honest ticking y'all niggas, niggas cross me got me acting shity 
 Real niggas is all that I keep 
 Keep watching the street making it happen with the rap and the beat 
 This the game and we bang on other gangs 
 That Don't play when we claim, so we knocks them out the frame 
 What a shame it is, can't be levels, can't be friends 
 Homies be acting funny we am swerve and an grin 
 But ain't no thang do you in 
 Grew up as an kid giving all I can give with one life to live 
 But with the Sean John give me con 
 From growing off of murder of mother fuckers, Bounty it's on 
 You know what time it is, drooping these rhymes again 
 Anyway it goes you niggas can't see my flow 
 (Daz Dillinger Chorus 2x) 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Why does niggas want to act funny with the money 
 We used to be down back in the day 
 Why does niggas want to act funny with the money 
 We used to be down back in the day 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Roll up an blunt 
 Pulling and punching giving it up for nothing 
 Only in it for something if it ain't cheese fucking, Roll up biz a bucket 
 I keep niggas coming, so watch out before your punk ass get knocked out 
 Stuff one right back up in your mouth 
 Waking up early, I'm down so what you cha talking about 
 I'm Daz Dillinger but I'm still dat nigga daz 
 Only in it just to get it just bust an niggas ass 
 Only demonstration, fuck conversation with us 
 Only conversation when we kick up dust 
 It's an must that I diss you niggas back again 
 Plus on your video talking all that smack 
 (Daz Dillinger Chorus 2x) 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Why does niggas want to act funny with the money 
 We used to be down back in the day 
 Why does niggas want to act funny with the money 
 We used to be down back in the day 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Now my last verse 
 Showing up an few women 
 I'm coming up and get bombed rushed 
 For running up Long Beach 
 Have you forgot where you from 
 Eastside of Long Beach represent 21 
 Blowing smoke in your face 
 Roll up an joint or bong 
 To set let your mother fucking ass to get out an song 
 Its strong to be weak, Watch out when I creep 
 And I land in yo ass to knock you out your feet 
 That pimp shit to impress me or faze me 
 All I fuck different y'all and y'all don't pay me 
 Simple as I can say I can say Fuck Y'all 
 This is from all of my doggs so Fuck Y'all 
 (Daz Dillinger Chorus 2x) 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Why does niggas want to act funny with the money 
 We used to be down back in the day 
 Why does niggas want to act funny with the money 
 We used to be down back in the day
