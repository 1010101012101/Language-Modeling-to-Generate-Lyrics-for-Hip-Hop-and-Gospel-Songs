 A fresh pair of khakis and take a bitch to the groovy ass niggas 
 To get your money man, get paid

 Put your rag on and get your motherfucking thang on, niggas

 [Dd] man you know my glock is hot 
 (Eastside) 
 Verse one: [kurupt tha kingpin] 
 I'm coming through your zone late night, shit 
 Dogg pound gangsta to flame the light shit 
 'Cause I hold on, 
 I'm 20 feet tall 
 The biggest walkin' bill fuck around to get killed 
 Get shoot 
 Don't try to sneak a peak in my book 
 (? Home at hose?), overdose the thoughts when he look 
 The forbidden 
 The hittin' zone that I'm hitting 
 Don't play with my intelligence nigga as the heat (? slittin'?) 
 (?) 
 So I only got two choices; loc me the blasin' bomb 
 Vietnam 
 I bring the pain rains no (?) 
 Execution style is the shells from the heat veal 
 Down to the ground like the rest of the dummies 
 Just what the fuck you thinkin' try to play with my money 
 It's nothing but the dogg pound gangstas 
 Mashes, verbal disasters, 38 stashes 
 Verse two: [tray deee] 
 I arise in disguise to surprise that ass 
 What you thought you caught me short 
 I might ride to blast 
 With the canna 
 We let the shit all up in your nuts 
 When niggas droppin', they stop with the plan they plots 
 Got to stop for my gate 
 With (?) of break 
 Marked niggas caught in, they try to win and get sprayed 
 Rip the gates 
 Go flip the page to chapter three 
 First groove, they fools can't come after me 
 I mash to free, 
 Styles of catastrophe 
 Ask for g 
 A nigga best to answer me 
 My rip long as the beach that I represent 
 Dead nigga with my stare not to step to this 
 Verse three: [daz dillinger] 
 Now o yeah tray deee 
 I mean I see the whole plot 
 Be on alert, niggas shot 
 Anywhere under that nigga caught 
 So drop the microphone on my own 
 I shown to blown 
 Away for these MC's with the sludge of a chrome 
 I take the fang 
 Down on my own lyrical name 
 When the sees are changed, 
 When the storms and hurricanes 
 Wide strand 
 Spittin' rhymes, the beats so precise 
 (?) 
 Skatin' on mics like ice 
 Twice in the day 
 I get drunk, 
 (?) Of plastic bags 
 Sack in the truck 
 Because the rhyme as claim 
 I shit buck like the doctor 
 Coming through 
 Bouncin' with the droptop 
 Like gangstas chillin' on the block 
 Nah, we ain't worry for shit 
 Got escape doors like capone 
 Whit chick your dick on my clip 
 Forty-fives and nives 
 Three-eighties and automatics 
 Sniveling, coming through for you 
 When your boys with some stats 
 I got to have eleven to thrill of the drama 
 Enthusing me to gets my norm with the slaughter 
 Ought to be known as daz dillinger 
 For the shit that I known for 
 A dogg pound criminal 
 Verse four: [soopafly] 
 Now if the spot's hot 
 I hit the switch make the topdrop 
 Don't stop 
 It's soopafly with the sho shot 
 Won't stop 
 I got ya whole shit to 
 Look and listen 
 I rendition the rhymes with precision 
 You can't face 
 Amaze me a place like a saddle 
 It's dogg pound ganstas (?) like a shadow 
 I never met a motherfucker who can make you stick 
 I never met a motherfucker who can feel my clique 
 You serve, you'll make the twitch like a nerve 
 You'll try to step to my wild style seperve 
 Adjective the verve 
 Action pack with the words 
 I'll make it stop 
 The jaws drop and observe 
 I sold the block for crook, daz, style and tray deee 
 We be coming with the shit 
 That be the bomb baby 
 And ain't a dogg pound gangsta will knock you to the flow 
 Either you stupid as fuck or just don't know 
 Verse five: [bad a$$] 
 Now I know you, know you, 
 Stupid as fuck 
 Cock, bust like a sawed off punk, 
 Double barrel on 'em 
 Black gambinos at casinos 
 Get de niro on 'em 
 If I want 'em 
 I go get 'em 
 If I gotta shot a nine 
 Twice, that's what I rhyme like 
 My clip ain't empty 
 Do try to test the ridah 
 Nativity simply 
 Bust, I lead inside ya 
 Find ya 
 Fear them, frightened for your life 
 With your last few 
 Live with hot live from gunblast 
 Outlaws, outcast 
 Low life, south last 
 Long beach niggas blast 
 Yeah the b-side is right 
 The most, the coast 
 The west, the best 
 We damn bitches 
 Sippin', hittin' switches 
 Dippin' hittin' robbin' niggas 
 Itchy fingers on triggers 
 Itty, bitty niggas 
 Ready for war 
 We kick down your door 
 Draw eatin' 
 Lay everybody down on the floor 
 Verse six: [technique] 
 The same thing, different place 
 With snakes, cowards and strong grown 
 Robbery cases, niggas faces 
 On paperchase 
 It was seen, it was written 
 It ain't forbidden 
 For homies to be splittin' 
 Disagree, no one was hitten 
 Known with the curls 
 The many obstacles 
 Impressions to the feet from gettin' served 
 Growing up is rough 
 Your name 
 Here's the streets it gets tough 
 You can (?) and (?) 
 Then I guess you had enough 
 Over (?) 
 It ain't coincidental that I be distorted 
 And my manual 
 Minds 
 Is for seein', so I watch 
 Bodies and plots 
 Win the plots 
 Call the shots for your nuts 
 Nigga grips 
 That's why I (?) my dippin' progress 
 Cause why is all we tryin' to defeat the progress 
 I just ain't the one mystic to hit 
 Young jonesy sees 
 Who I got a mission to hit 
 And constantly flips scripts 
 Outta wall with balls fast talkin' 
 And quick draws 
 How the problem is solved 
 I want it all (I want it all) 
 But it's movin' to slow 
 I'm out to blow 
 I don't know which way to go, 
 Was on the right path 
 I thought 
 Without doin' a dirty word about getting caught 
 ("Getting caught" echoes)
