(Lil' C-Style) 
 Ooh Weee, it's going down Long Beach connect gang 
 Me an my nigga daz doing thangs 
 Yeah, can't stop this shit, I'm tired of all this bull shit 
 Nigga independent over here, now what I'm sayin' 
 You can't count my shit, ya know 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 I smoked Tora before I had an call 
 Went from a little old nigga to an world wide rap star 
 My pockets stay fat 
 Sometimes I want to say fuck rap and get an sack (Why's That) 
 That where's my heart is at, that why I started that 
 Somebody tell me party at 
 So I can get bombed in riding on the 110, to the 91 to 710 
 I'm back in the beach again, just riding high jumped out with an grin 
 Mother fuckers shoot ten 
 Started off with fifty dollars, no I'm up to an thousand 
 Hit nigga after lick, C.I.S now I'm on some gangsta shit 
 (Daz Dillinger Chorus 2x) 
 One Nine, Nine, Nine, Nine 
 (Lil' C-Style) 
 I touch more woman than I can ever feel 
 I stop at the set where the homeboys chill 
 I spot big homie C-bo with the gat and bat 
 Cross the street and the corner with the orange sack 
 As I continue my mission down m.l.k 
 I bust a right and see my homie hanging out on nineteen 
 Baby boy where that gangsta from who and g.c 
 I'm that little nigga C Style from nineteen street 
 Not haft way to dip to my hood just yet 
 I spot an bad ass bitch she want to give me some head 
 So I take ten Tracy's, I got an bitch to get 
 I love fucking bitches that I just can't hit 
 (Lil C-Style Chorus 2x) 
 One Nine, Nine, Nine, Nine 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Yeah, ha ha one nine nine nine 
 Daz an Lil Style coming through you like that 
 Now you know Eastside is where we hang 
 Got the one nine loc and doing the thang 
 Don't make curb serving, dub or die 
 Taking penitentiary chasing and rapping at the same time 
 My homie once want way back 
 You better read the walls and know where you at 
 Or get your little ass jack, that's why I stay strap 
 When I'm on the Eastside I keep it on my lap 
 Lil Style 
 (Lil C Style) 
 Nigga I got stay strap 
 Even though I'm fresh out the county and ain't trying to go back 
 To fucking roaches and rats 
 And nasty ass food, I ain't try to eat that 
 I'm trying to see brand new house and an cadillac 
 Where my six hoes, number one on the bizzat 
 Where my Daz and you know we on fizzat 
 I was carrying to and duce five to an four-five strizzat 
 So eaze up and recognize us 
 Me an my nigga D-A-Z ain't we nothin' but some riders 
 Ain't an damn thang could divide us 
 This is real ass mother fucking Eastsidas 
 (Lil C-Style Chorus 2x) 
 One Nine, Nine, Nine, Nine

 (Big Pimping) 
 Now you ain't never show the feeling like the blow 
 That wind place the show and the nine nine that how shit go 
 Fa sho, smoking is what makes train go 
 Blowing circles around over here 
 How many is with the bullets on the bed

 Cause this song, now that is some of that gangsta shit
