Comin' from the city where no pity is shown shown shown shown 
 <Lady V.> 
 In California 4X 
 <Daz overlapping Lady V> 
 Rollin' down Crenshaw Boulevard 
 Starin' at these suckas who claim to be hard 
 Daz Dillinger and the Gang 
 Who can blast and gangbang Ha ha 
 Who gives it up for every hooker rat and hood slut 
 All in the cut Dat Nigga Daz with the pimp strut 
 You slept game on those who act lame 
 See ain't a damn thang changed 
 You know I ride the neighborhood slow 
 Floss on you and let the weed blow 
 True indeed I'm havin' a ball 
 Pick up the phone and give my homiez a call 
 What's up with y'all? (What's up y'all?) 
 Livin' in the city where we born to ball 
 Rolled up a Philly we pack it tight 
 What a pity what a sight 
 And hella Chronic all damn night 
 Got the weed it got me kinda feelin' so high 
 Hennessy got a brother so feelin' so high 
 Pull outta state enjoy my day & I love to burn rubber 
 Pump up the jam for the summer 
 Gimme Eureka Snoop got the Hummer 
 Kinda make you wanna sit back and wonder

 Rockin' like wonder MC homey without a band in hand
