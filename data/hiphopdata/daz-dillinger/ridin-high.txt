That nigga Daz and Dub C in this motherfucker 
 (What's happening nigga?) 
 Doing what we got to do, every day all day 
 And if you didn't know, now you know 
 So get it right, beeootch 
 Yah and it goes like that 
 Gangsta shit, nuttin' but gangsta shit 
 Gangsta shit, nuttin' but gangsta shit 
 WC, Daz, nigga Daz 
 Gangsta shit, nuttin' but gangsta shit 
 Just ridin' high

 Come on, don't trip, don't trip 
 Just ridin' high 
 (Just ridin' high) 
 Just ridin' by 
 (Just ridin' by) 
 Come on, don't trip, don't trip 
 It's like chill, why do we have to fool and get ill 
 On what we call the dollar, dollar bill? 
 You can get killed for that paint job and wheels 
 Oh my, oh my, I love the dollar, dollar bill 
 Oh juicy, be like [unverified] when he shot steel 
 Put the blame up on you and be out with the loot 
 Slang coke or weed, pills 
 You got pinky when the cup of blood got spilled 
 Shit outta luck, there ain't no refills 
 I'm more deadlier then ever 
 What I got'll see through your armor shield 
 Show you breakdown with your bills 
 Recognize the real side that'll ride and kill 
 Just for sure 
 Just ridin' high

 Come on, don't trip, don't trip 
 Chronic's in the bag rollin' all day 
 Blue [unverified] six with [unverified] called [unverified] 
 Age sixteen, I'm tired of hearing mom's mouth 
 "Motherfucker get a job or get ya punk ass out" 
 A little wild seed, influenced by the G's 
 Strong bombing, pistol whipping and twisting niggas for cheese 
 It's the normal method, barrel start by the jail 
 Wreck a long one [unverified] the real stretch marks 
 A juvenile packing millimeters 
 And when I'm close to doing a third 
 Nigga I got more stripes then a zebra 
 Will I live and make it out of the ghetto but will I die? 
 Only God knows nigga but for now I just know I'm just 
 Just ridin' high

 Come on, don't trip, don't trip 
 You got the upper hand, take control and take command 
 Get your blast over with and cut the bullshit 
 I the need the chips in a hurry 
 By the end of the day I'm having 'em, don't worry 
 Sorta like a dream or a storybook, a born crook 
 Shook all the bustas that snitch, now I'ma black book 
 It took a while, being so broke it's hard to smile 
 Hard living, trying to be grown when I'm a child 
 Overshadowed by negativity 
 Running and stealing, running from security 
 Something like a mystery 
 Drugs, bitches to county jails, penitentiaries 
 My background history 'cause the game is so trickory 
 Now what's the remedy, should we strive, the streets is killing me 
 Or should we lay down in a cell shit's forgiving me? 
 Criminal activity, crack sales are killing me 
 (A bunch or syllables said really fast) 
 Just chill 
 I'm tired of living the life of crime 
 Just chill 
 The life of the deaf, dumb and blind 
 Just chill 
 Why do we have to fool and get ill 
 Don't trip 
 It's all about the dollar, dollar bill 
 Just ridin' high 
 (Just ridin' high) 
 Just ridin' by 
 (Just ridin' by) 
 Come on, don't trip, don't trip 
 Just ridin' high 
 (Just ridin' high) 
 Just ridin' by 
 (Just ridin' by) 
 Come on, don't trip, don't trip 
 You motherfuckers wanted to know what the gang was all about 
 And now you know, you ain't got to look no further 
 WC and that nigga Daz 
 Bringing it to you, hardcore, raw, smooth, gangsta shit 
 Sucka, 98-97 99-2G, whoo 
 What? What? What? Hey
