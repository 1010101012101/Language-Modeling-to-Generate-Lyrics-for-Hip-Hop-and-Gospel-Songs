(Feat. Snoop Dogg, E-White and Uncle Rec) 
 (Daz talkin') 
 Man, I need a hit 
 Yeah, what's goin' on over here 
 You know my nigga got the fat ass motherfuckin bags 
 Yo, 'sup! 
 What you got 
 Yeah, you know, comin' to buy you out 
 I know you got that fire 
 (Daz) 
 We hit the liquor sto' 
 Grab some Satin, limonade, cool-aid and fuck the fo'-0 
 Blaze the indo 
 Me and E-White and Snoop Dogg in the fo'-do' caddy 
 With that sticky icky shit, nigga blaze a fatty 
 My people know me when I touch down the soul 
 I have it, bring it up my nigga 
 Puff the bud and bag it 
 Lace my filas, adjust my tamps and grab my heaters 
 Khakis and wife-beaters and blaze the fuckin' weed up 
 Yeah, you know we did that 
 Git back and say I did that 
 Is that the bomb shizzat 
 That put me on my bizzack 
 Purple orange the flavour of the month in a blunt 
 Whatever you need, I got what you want 
 I got dat 
 (Uncle Reo chorus) 
 (Fire, I'm on fire) 
 Ooh I'm on fire 
 (Fire, fire) 
 And I don't wanna be pulled out 
 (Fire, I'm on fire) 
 I wanna keep on burnin 
 (Fire, fire) 
 Forever I'm on fire 
 (E-White) 
 Something so hot it leave me sweat 
 Bairly breathin soakin wet 
 Don't expect me to be close up on it unless you let me 
 I bet cha it is better for us both to let me close 
 Is you 'bout it, keep private shit that jump off in the closet 
 Baby what you want, I hope Daz got a blunt 
 I hope Snoop will let me swoop in Snoop DeVille so I can stunt 
 Straight fire baby 
 Take it back to the wire maybe 
 I can find what I was lookin' fo' 
 A wide open hooka ho' 
 Mad dog 'cause I'm lookin' on 
 'Cause it ain't no bitch in me 
 Picture any nigga disrespectin when he mention me 
 This could be the start of something good so let's make it happen 
 Get back to the hood 
 The whole time me and my niggaz smoke that 
 (Uncle Reo chorus) 
 (Fire, I'm on fire) 
 Ooh baby you set my soul on fire 
 (Fire, fire) 
 With the thing that you do to me 
 (Fire, fire) 
 I wanna let you know 
 (Fire, fire) 
 That I'm on, I'm on fire 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 I'm electrifyin, dramatisin, recognizin, victimisin 
 Fratinizin, scandalizin, realizin, tantilizin 
 Analizin, sexasizin, vandalizin, enterprisin 
 Maximizin all this shit 
 Runnin' my game and I call that bitch 
 Put her in a stable 
 See if she's able 
 Sit her at the table 
 Yeah she's able 
 Will she do it, she got to do it 
 I run these hoes like Clark Gable 
 Raid these labels 
 Enable myself to turn the tables to increase my wealth 
 Move stealth was the tech on the shelf 
 Try to keep to myself 
 I don't bother nobody 
 Usually when I fall in a party 
 Shit I become the life of the party 
 And everybody wanna smoke with the big dog with the big dope 
 Its doggy dizzle and he wizzle 
 And my lil kin fizzle 
 Daz Dilly is so silly 
 Still he will he blaze another philly 
 Stick it together and blow your mind 
 Probably so like Donahoe 
 But I ain't tryin' to find a hoe 
 And if I'm rhymin too fast, that's 'cause you movin too slow 
 You don't know, you won't know 
 Just hit some of this for the mental *chock sound* 
 Uhhmmm now let that shit go 
 Now, you know, we know, he know, she know 
 That boss D-O-G original weed smokin' 
 It's always 
 (Uncle Reo chorus) 
 (Fire, I'm on fire) 
 On fire 
 (Fire, fire) 
 And I don't never ever wanna be put down 
 (Fire, I'm on fire) 
 Are you high 
 (Fire, fire) 
 Whoa, never ever wanna ever be pulled down 
 Baby, you just don't know that you got my soul on fire 
 I don't ever be pulled out
