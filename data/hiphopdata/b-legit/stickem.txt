I bring your drummer like Osama, a suicide bomber 
 I fuck your baby momma treat your kids with benning hummer, well she like broke her highness, brace to her asset, I be pulling that, from the back, when I'm bashin', 
 Back to the class inn, one on one assassin, Desert Eagle blastin' did we get them mashin', fuck the pussy ass-in, 
 I know where they massin', I pull up on me jet bike, 
 And give y'em whole headlight, right back, light back, 
 The traffic doing dumb-shit, snitches like to sing, 
 Bullets like to hump bitch, come and get your some shit, 
 I give em' out for free and I be shooting from the bass line, 
 Trying to hit the three 
 I bulletproof stickem, like gank-and let em' hit em', 
 Let the tommy spin em' put hollows and tiffs in em', 
 All in his beemer, you want 'em then' we assen em', 
 Like corners with rinem, run in em' just like women, 
 I got that bulletproof stickem, like gank-and let em' hit em', 
 Let the tommy spin em' put hollows and tiffs in em', 
 All in his beemer, you want em' then we assen em', 
 Like corners with rinem, run in em' just like women, 
 I got the cop killin' billies in my shit loaded quick, 40-cal. toys for you niggers talkin' shit, and I can make you run like Reggie, 'cause I be popping hoes' to the dough's in your chevvy, and no I won't bite you, fight you or scratch you, 
 Catch you on that way way, let them boys snatch you, 
 Been meaning to get at you, where you been pimpin', 
 I got some hot shit that be poppin' out and chippin', 
 You know them boys fishin' and guess who comin' with me, and I be slippin' shit in your ball -stones and kidneys, smokin' with the hippies, everything is drifty, and I'll be in the bank if you wanna' come and get me, come and get me, 
 I bulletproof stickem, like gank-and let em' hit em', 
 Let the tommy spin em' put hollows and tiffs in em', 
 All in his beemer, you want 'em then' we assen em', 
 Like corners with rinem, run in em' just like women, 
 I got that bulletproof stickem, like gank-and let em' hit em', 
 Let the tommy spin em' put hollows and tiffs in em', 
 All in his beemer, you want 'em then' we assen em', 
 Like corners with rinem, run in em' just like women, 
 H-ane, block game, know we like the cop thing, 
 Squak things, pop things, all up on the block man, 
 I tell you off top man it ain't about the boogie, 
 'Its about the boogie and ill motherfucking show her' 
 I am tryin' to be patient, patience is a virtue, 
 You play with my emotions, you gon' make me hurt you, 
 Ill show you what the girder do, put you on a shirt or two, stick my helmets on you and I bet you they gon' murk you, you know you got that work too, supersofa squirt you, 
 Boy you just abandoned motherfucker I can purp you, 
 You can keep this merk too, and bullets they gon search you, show you what that suit, and that gasket and that church do, 
 I bulletproof stickem, like gank-and let em' hit em', 
 Let the tommy spin em' put hollows and tiffs in em', 
 All in his beemer, you want 'em then' we assen em', 
 Like corners with rinem, run in em' just like women, 
 I bulletproof stickem, like gank-and let em' hit em', 
 Let the tommy spin em' put hollows and tiffs in em', 
 All in his beemer, you want 'em then' we assen em', 
 Like corners with rinem, run in em' just like women,
