B-Legit (Levitti) 
 And it goes down, like this, like this 
 (Into my des-ti-ny, now I see now I see) 
 And it goes like this, like this 
 (Was once confused by these haters, now I see now I see) 
 I'm in the house about six, twist the lit 
 I park my V-Hic feedin my bitch 
 They wonder if I switched since I signed my deal, I'm Legit! 
 I'm deep up in this game for real 
 The bars of steel I got the black gate 
 Twin 38's just to keep things straight 
 I'm late for everythang money is joy 
 I run the rap game like a ol' D-boy 
 I can rock gator boots and wear K-Swiss 
 Put the diamonds on my pinky watchin the wrist 
 I'll tell you like this the g'z gon' sag 
 Wit some real freem in my bag 
 And it goes like this, like this 
 Des-ti-ny now I see, was once confused by these haters in this cold 
 So-cie-ty 
 Now maybe I'm wrong about the way I fluc 
 But the game stays real to me I can't help but get my skrill 
 I'm in the wind, 600 Benz up in the traffic 
 My rims, reals girls in it's like magic, its drastic 
 Tryin' to live the life that I live 
 I rap P.I. and stay high as I need 
 I'm a factor, brought in a rapper 
 I'm from the game 
 Legit is the name the mo' skrilla the fame 
 In the train, all in Seatle where it rains 
 You can by my slang I'm from the bay maine 
 A rap star piece I'm a beast on the mic 
 It's ten, I'll creep up in by midnight 
 You can check my rap site B-Legit.com 
 And it tell you that yo' boy he the bomb 
 And it goes like this, like this 
 Make way, a brand new day, so peep the boss 
 It's true when I come through so tear it off 
 It cost, so we all kick it and ball 
 And talk about the platinum and gold on the wall 
 I'm a savage, ain't nobody bad like me 
 Got people from the bay all the way to DC 
 Ask the boy RP and KRED 
 About a hog out the valley named legitamet B 
 I'm a mac, I rap on special request 
 Call me superman without the cape and the "S" 
 I'm from the hillside and plan to hold that down 
 So let me know when you fools hit the westbound 
 (Levitti) 
 I'm feelin' like I got the whole world in my hands 
 Give the boots on the feet for the limp-in 
 Sophisticated high classsssy 
 If you gonna have it, have it Lavissssh
