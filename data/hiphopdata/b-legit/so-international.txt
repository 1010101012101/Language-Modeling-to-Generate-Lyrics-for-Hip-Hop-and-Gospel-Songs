(B-Legit) 
 Me and Too $hort we do the frequent miles 
 In and out of ports keep secret files 
 First peep the smile, Then flash the wrist 
 Diamonds get them pissy when its stashed like this 
 On a flash like this 
 According to the script 
 Hoes do the choosin', A boss he flipped 
 I skipped from Peru went straight to the ?? 
 Them boys from the Bay and all day we be at it 
 (Too $hort) 
 Yeah, We fly first class touch down like pimps 
 What's the next event, Tell me what town its in 
 I'll see ya there man, I always do 
 I had some good weed, Some hoes too 
 What the feinin' for, Give it too'em 
 All around the world we get to do'em 
 When I'm on vacation everyday I fuck 
 Bad bitches see a player, Wanna lay up 
 (Chorus (Woman Singin') 
 The places I go make me so international 
 People I meet make me so international 
 Wherever I go I'll be so international 
 Wherever it goes I'm just so international 
 (Too $hort) 
 I run into my folks, Nothin's too far 
 Got a few breezies, Gettin' drunk at the bar 
 I don't care where I'm at 
 I'll make ya girl share that 
 I step in the room she recognize a player mack 
 Known for my raps, Gettin' blown in the back 
 Gimme 10 G's a microphone and some 'Yak 
 And don't forget my Kahlua and Baliey's 
 Look and learn, Don't ask me what I'll do to ya lady 
 (B-Legit) 
 Now what I'll do to ya lady, I'll do to ya life 
 Come through, Break you, Get out with my stripes 
 Pipe down big dog ain't no need to be soar 
 'Cause I'll I'm comin' for is the Christian Dior 
 Catch ya boy off shore, Candy bars in the store 
 Forever papered up but they handed me more 
 Did Twins in Minnesota at the All-Star Break 
 Bounced all across state on them concert dates 
 (B-Legit) 
 California Baby that's the way we get down 
 Handcuff'em now, You know we comin' to town 
 No we don't smoke brown but we do shoot rounds 
 Green 16's over Rick Rock sounds 
 Call me flip flop now, Mix yellow and brown 
 Korean, European, Know they all get down 
 Muslims get the money man I'll see you in Guam 
 I'm there 2 weeks need freaks and bomb 
 (Too $hort) 
 We knocked these ?? girls from Oregon 
 They had a flight to catch early in the mornin' to Portland 
 It doesn't matter where ya from baby 
 We can have some fun, Maybe 
 Me and B-La, Yeah we got jungle fever 
 But it's all about the money with us 
 We don't want ya people to think we discrimanatin' 
 Can't make the pimpin' wait 
 I spit a lil game then I listen to what women say 
 (Chorus till end)
