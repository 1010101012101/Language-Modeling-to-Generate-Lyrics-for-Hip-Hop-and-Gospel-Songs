Bad day with my bitch 
 Negativity on my phone is ridiculous 
 Limo shine up on the real Tech N9ne 
 They talkin' 'bout I'm the sickness 
 Comin' at that shit so vicious 
 Get up out of my bed, I'm sick of feelin' restricted 
 Fans sayin' I switched 
 They can tell I was hurt by lookin' at my Twit pic 
 Got a call from Stevie, y'all know his steezie 
 Said he's 'bout to come to KC, wanna have a get together, that's easy 
 Got a little Cabo Wabo, some biz and Cîroc, yo 
 They wanna have it at my house, is there room for Frizz and Picasso? 
 Hell yeah, come on down 
 Told Makzilla be done on rounds, we gotta get more liquor, spread the fun around 
 We 'bout to kick it with family, put the gun on down 
 Nigga, I ain't kicked it in eons 
 'Bout to be cooler than Freon 
 Got another call from my homeboy in Denver, named Dion 
 He just pulled into KC sayin' he's double fisted, with bottles 
 I told him I was on liquor duty and ?Stone'em? was on models 
 All of my niggas ready for action 
 When I woke, I don't remember this crashin' 
 I can try and tell you in the next verse 
 But I don't really know what happened 
 It's just a blur, blur, blur 
 The whole thing's just a blur, blur, blur 
 It's just a blur, blur, blur 
 The whole thing's just a blur, blur, blur 
 The whole thing's just a blur 
 Woke up, got sick, ain't nobody sleepin' in my shit 
 Looked in the mirror, that's fucked up 
 Because busted is my top lip 
 Real busted, real puffy, like a nigga punched me the fuck out 
 I don't smoke by my mouth taste like big ? like my nigga Yukmouth 
 I think I remember two chicks, one thick, another was a toothpick 
 I think I was takin' shots with 'em, of Patrón, I don't do this 
 KC Teas, ghetto suds, talkin' to the chick with ghetto butts 
 She was trippin' when another beautiful widow cut 
 In front of me when she was talkin', I said "Oh, fuck!" 
 Everybody keep sayin' 
 But I don't remember even seein' 
 But I heard if you really wanna please 
 Put one, two, and maybe three 
 Glimpses of a house full of bitches and dancin' 
 And some losin' their pants, romancin' each other 
 And eating each other, and beating these brotha's 
 My publicist almost stuck a bitch 
 'Cause she punched my nigga with her fucking fist 
 But he kicked her out, instead 
 ??? 
 Then somehow when I touched her 
 My lip hit her big head 
 Scenario, what happened? 
 That nigga keep laughin', 'cause he made all the drinks potent 
 My lip is fucked, I'm not jokin' 
 Said she's made up with hips out, she 'bout 5'1", hell pretty, but cripped out 
 Said she got a little cocky, called me a demon and I flipped out 
 Said her body was boozed up and her earlobes had a few cuts 
 I told him I don't hit women, I don't do stuff 
 I came downstairs, all my niggas still sprawled out 
 The makings of Caribou Lou, now there's a loose screw 
 The night was going perfectly, all seemed well 
 I woke up in the darkness dizzy, feelin' like hell 
 I don't feel like myself, oh no 
 I've never ever felt this way before in so long 
 It's just a blur
