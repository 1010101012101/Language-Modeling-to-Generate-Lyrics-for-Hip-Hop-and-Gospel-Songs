Okay, now that were here, I can finally tell you guys, 
 What I brought you here for 
 So, but first of all, cheers to Strange, toast, glass's up 
 All right, all right this is how it went 
 I saw her in the woods by herself I had a knife 
 Perfect opportunity to take another life 
 Unfortunately I'm fucking ya kids instead of your wife 
 She was 18 so she could make her own decisions 
 Sacramento born so she knew I prolly visit 
 What is it a blizzard? Nigga I'll cut her up with the scissors 
 Laid the skin out on the table able to stretch it 
 Picture a nigga bathing in blood and butt naked 
 I met her at the studio I put her my record 
 Told her I'd give her an ass cap if she turned that ass backwards 
 I lifted up the black skirt, stuck a N9ne in her 
 Pulled the trigger 
 Now she gone and you eating her for dinner 
 I never would have told y'all 
 But I love y'all niggas 
 Told her my tour bunk was right above y'all niggas 
 She really wanted to see y'all 
 But I met her first 
 She told me she had a ¡MAYDAY! CD in her purse 
 I told her I was a Strange artist she didn't believe me 
 I was starin' at the ¡MAYDAY! tattoo on her cleavage 
 She also had a Tech N9ne tat on her ass cheek vasoline 
 She say she just got it done last week 
 I said Techs to busy that's a long shot 
 See he in the north pole fuckin' a eskimo slut 
 He said the pussy was cold and the rest was all cock? 
 Felt like the pussy was dead kinda like a zombie 
 I gave her some of that Humboldt cookie bomb weed 
 She was higher than the space needle 
 I keep that shit almost everyplace we go 
 I statred cuttin' up the arms and the legs 
 And I had the bags in the passanger seat 
 And a blunt in the ashtray 
 Now I'm drivin' down the free way 
 Paranoid, hella wired and I was drivin' for 3 days 
 I almost dropped the body parts off at the truck stop 
 Hella tired 
 Like for 2 hours I sucked cock 
 I couldn't focus, eyes hella blurry, I can't stop 
 Goin' back to Cali ain't an option get caught by the cops 
 So I came to Kansas City just to talk to Trav 
 Y'all was on the next thing smokin' now we eatin meat 
 I'm on the news, did you see me on the I.D. channel 
 They got a story about me called bloody candles 
 They say I murdured hella people 
 And ate the bodies up 
 They had some 6 foot nigga play my body double FUCK 
 Ya man, I swear He even looked like you, I couldn't believe it 
 Yo, yo whatd you put in this food man, this shit is fuckin' awesome B 
 I swear to god man 
 We really glad to be sittin' at the breakin bread with the mannible of lector 
 And this animal flesh just a stab at the best and we expect no less from the gesture? 
 All right, and I seen her at the show at the day act up at the fuck we I 
 Morse Code tat with a flesh filled high and a pair of red socks No lie 
 This meal is fantastic, thanks for the invite Lynch 
 Cheers to Strange, too right, The Snake and Bats the shit 
 Well Tech is fuckin' the eskimos in the north pole 
 We bath saltin' in Miami where the whores snort blow 
 We been all up on your cannibal shit, the cannibals twist 
 And now we on some mannible shit, the mammals we gets 
 We damage with the top of our fist an ice pick 
 Swing hard just to dammed the clique Strange Music 
 Ay that's what's up, I need to ass filleted in this booth 
 And this meat a little too tough Brotha Lyncha mighta been ? overcooked 
 But back to the matter at hand I leave you damaged with fam 
 Which might cause concern 
 But at the end of the day its bros' before hoes' 
 They don't ever seem to learn right Bernz 
 Lets chew it, the girls came through it, got more then she bargained for 
 She had a body that was so damn thick the bowels could rip apart your jaw 
 Scars, hard, this broad playin' backyard 
 So it's a shame you chopped her up Lynch 
 But life is hard 
 And I'm not her bodyguard 
 Goddamn this steak is charred 
 Pass me the whisky please brotha 
 I need to ease the gods 
 But the demons clause 
 I scratch beneath the stars 
 And give 'em another reason to up in needin sacrafeastin large? 
 So we thank you Brotha Lynch Hung for this invitation 
 And we forgive you for the fan of ours you mutilated 
 And on behalf of all of us in ¡MAYDAY! heres our statement 
 Were down to roll with you no matter what the situation 
 So basically what I was tryin' to tell you guys
