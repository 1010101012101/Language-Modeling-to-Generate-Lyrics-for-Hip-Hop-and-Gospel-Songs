(Intro - Blood Raw) 
 Ha-ha 
 She say she wonder how the sun shines 
 (Blood Raw!) 
 She say she never rode in a Chevy neither 
 (For real?) 
 I love my Chevy my nigga 
 (I know you do too homeboy) 
 I'ma show you how to enjoy your time down here baby girl where we stay 
 (Cte, u.s.d.a.!) 
 [Chorus - Young Jeezy] X2 
 I don't mean to brag, but my shit so clean 
 My Chevy do something to my self esteem 
 Alpine in the dash, and the duals in the ass 
 And that wet, wet paint, the shit look like glass 
 (Verse 1 - Blood Raw) 
 Zoom, just how my Chevy sound 
 Bump, bump, bump, just how the Chevy sound 
 It's like a band in a nigga donk 
 Rock four fives, it's like a band in a nigga trunk 
 Boat motor right now, nigga pass me 
 502, donk riding like Trick Daddy 
 Rally stripes, the Chevy transform 
 When the doors go up, it looks like there's something more 
 Flowmasters, MagnaFlow tips 
 And them hoes catch nuts when they see that shit 
 Brown jet, feeling jet, no carburetor 
 And the color apple green like a Now and Later 
 (Verse 2 - Rick Ross) 
 Boss 
 Yesterday I caught a flat, as I ran out of gas, with a pocket full of stacks 
 Your Chevy can't compare 
 These niggas scared to inhale my motor breathing on a L 
 The peddle, I mash down, my window, was half down 
 The L, I pass around, you smell it like hash browns 
 Million dollar nigga still smoking in a Class E 
 And my homie with a mobile, watch him let him blast it 
 I'm sitting on twenty something's, that ain't important 
 What's important is getting plenty money 
 Racist Section 8, they continue to segregate 
 I ain't tripping, I'm loading weight and booming around the way 
 I got to find a better way, until I do I got a new AK off in the Chevrolet 
 Riding with the bitch I fucked last night 
 Her pussy still wet as she listen to the glass pipes 
 Boss 
 (Verse 3 - Blood Raw) 
 I'm from the Gunshine, where them boys ride Chevy 
 Little mama say she never rolled in a Chevy 
 Say she like the paint job and the way it sounds 
 She like the way it look when I let the top down 
 Alpine touch screen I got three twenties 
 26's homie, my Chevy, he a grown man 
 It look real sweet, don't it man? 
 Like Shaq, got big feet on it, man 
 So about it, like to hear the motor low 
 When I hit the gas, I bet that bitch don't choke 
 Enjoy the ride, I'ma show you why the sun shines 
 Put it all on the line that a nigga can't out run mine
