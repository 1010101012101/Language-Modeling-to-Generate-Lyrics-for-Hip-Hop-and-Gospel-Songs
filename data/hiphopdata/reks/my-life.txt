[Intro] [Reks talking]: 
 Oh yeah, yeah... Almost famous. 
 Take a moment, reflect 
 Get it together, oh yes 
 We getting rid of the stress 
 Only forward steps 
 Escalators to the top of the sky 
 We gon rise 
 Open up your eyes 
 See, I'm... 
 (Just figuring out my life) 
 And t the beat of my heart, It won't stop, y'all 
 To the beat of my soul, it keeps goin' on 
 To the beat of my heart, It won't stop, y'all 
 To the beat of my soul, it keeps goin' on 
 (Just figuring out my life) 
 [Verse One]: 
 Confused as I been as to where and when 
 The road to success goes, and stresses end 
 I am the key to my fate 
 Moment I wake, my eyes see the mistakes 
 In my lifetime 
 Write rhymes, to the beat and the rain 
 Knowing tomorrow bring blue skies 
 Easing the pain, so I can figure life 
 (Get it right) 
 Straighten the aim 
 AM to PM 
 We reaching 
 Until we eatin' 
 Me and Blaze P. fam knowing we can 
 Amass cash fast for the son and wife 
 (Figuring out my life) 
 The goal is to win 
 The road begin 
 The moment my pen touch the paper 
 We blend like chemicals 
 When we on it 
 Who want it? 
 Open up your eyes 
 Sky's the limit, believe we on the rise 
 I'm 
 (Figuring out my life) 
 Take a moment, reflect 
 Get it together, oh yes

 To the beat of my soul, it keeps goin' on 
 To the beat of my heart, It won't stop, y'all 
 To the beat of my soul, it keeps goin' on

 [Verse Two]: 
 The forward push is a must, get a rush when I 
 Hit the zone 
 And it's all for the throne and I 
 Put it down get it in 
 On my life dog 
 Want the crown with the mic so I write y'all 
 Day and night, y'all with the grind on my mind 
 And the time on my side 
 And the homies who gon' ride 
 I'm an OG and I 
 Never sleep till I die 
 Never weep till the 
 Skies open up for me 
 Gotta preach, gotta teach 
 What my peeps told me 
 Still I'm 
 (Figuring out my life) 
 We gotta awake 
 Willin' to make sacrifices 
 Life at stake 
 To reappear in the afterlife 
 I feel the spirit in my lyrics of the ghost past 
 Try to awake him when I scribble on the notepad 
 (I'm just figuring out my life) 
 And t the beat of my heart, It won't stop, y'all 
 To the beat of my soul, it keeps goin' on 
 To the beat of my heart, It won't stop, y'all 
 To the beat of my soul, it keeps goin' on

 Get it together, oh yes 
 We getting rid of the stress 
 Only forward steps 
 Escalators to the top of the sky 
 We gon rise 
 Open up your eyes 
 See, I'm... 
 (Just figuring out my life) 
 And t the beat of my heart, It won't stop, y'all 
 To the beat of my soul, it keeps goin' on 
 To the beat of my heart, It won't stop, y'all 
 To the beat of my soul, it keeps goin' on
