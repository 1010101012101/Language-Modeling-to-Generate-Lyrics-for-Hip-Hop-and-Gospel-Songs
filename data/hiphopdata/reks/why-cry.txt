This evolution of revolution when I'll be televised 
 Hard to decide if you were right 
 Die, die, shed tears but why cry? It's all gone 
 Soldiers no longer soldiers, ghettos no longer ghettos 
 Prisons still trying to hold us 
 Rebels would rather rebel, they all gone 
 Shed tears but why cry, still strong 
 Yeah, ghetto misery, yo' with alchemist symphonies 
 One third of century just ain't making no sense to me 
 Sending me the cells where hell's real, get name killed 
 Body for a dollar and who we power and lust 
 Cowards bust, we coward dust, chop it up to the game 
 A nigger's life cops is living the same 
 Rest in peace, to Timmy went through his brains 
 Sorry for your mama's pain, are we came supreme? 
 Remember fiends and dreams of good life 
 Not talking, giving whips and chains, living 
 'Cause we greedy but need main 
 My city stands my memory 
 Visions of remains like the break of game 
 Brother get brother, yeah, I'm talking 
 Able Cain for the paper bane 
 Hate on your name, pawn in the palm of the system 
 Hey, spit a pawn if you get on nigger swing 
 You change packs on 
 If your name don't crack, niggers is lame 
 This evolution of revolution when I'll be televised 
 Hard to decide if you were right 
 Die, die, shed tears but why cry? It's all gone 
 Soldiers no longer soldiers, ghettos no longer ghettos 
 Prisons still trying to hold us 
 Rebels would rather rebel, they all gone 
 Shed tears but why cry, still strong 
 The evolution of revolution revolting 
 Me, I'm more alive but the 45 is colting 
 No religion get treated like assaulting 
 You can fuck around and your face will get molten 
 Little niggers is different, they got me tripping 'cause 
 They don't know traditional, they don't know addition just 
 New clothes but they know the limited edition of a new whip 
 New ship, that's why I throw to deuces 
 On my shit, I could smoke with Medusa 
 Ain't a nigger tight of budget, ain't a nigger looser 
 I'm the rebel, a true blue, true nigger 
 I don't change colors like the that dodge soldier 
 The high guy telling you bye, bye loader 
 And let it fly nigger then why cry 
 Big shouts to my nigger Rex bring static 
 Like static until I get a bigger check 
 This evolution of revolution when I'll be televised 
 Hard to decide if you were right 
 Die, die, shed tears but why cry? It's all gone 
 Soldiers no longer soldiers, ghettos no longer ghettos 
 Prisons still trying to hold us 
 Rebels would rather rebel, they all gone 
 Shed tears but why cry, still strong 
 I be where the monsters at, I be where the monsters at 
 I be where the monsters at, I be where the monsters at
