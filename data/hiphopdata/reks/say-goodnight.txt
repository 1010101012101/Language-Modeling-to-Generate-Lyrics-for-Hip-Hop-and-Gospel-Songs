(Intro] [Reks talking) 
 Primo. Reks. Long time coming. Listen! 
 [Verse One]: 
 I think they want the new P.E now 
 Ice Cube, Nigga With An Attitude now 
 They want a dude who's immune to the Rules 
 Short fuse, aiming at Q, Bishop on the roof now 
 They want me to say; Fuck who in the game 
 If your the best rapper alive, then Reks insane 
 I think Preme's insane, best producer alive 
 Me upon the track is like needles to the veins 
 Like burners to the brain 
 Suicide chest, playing suicide king 
 My aim when I came was to bring back the Gang Starr audio reign 
 No longer R-E-K-S, it's R-E-Cocaine 
 Y'all on the way out, Reks on the way in 
 East coast boom bap, PM to the AM 
 Opinion on my rap, delivery propane 
 Rhythmatic, eternal king, supreme, remember the name 
 REKS! 
 (Scratch Chorus) 
 Big Pun "Say Goodnight" 
 Rakim "Drop the mic you shouldn't be holding it 
 This is how it should be done" 
 Xzibit "Dropping bows on 'em, I like to catch them 
 While they slippin'" 
 Big Pun "Say Goodnight" 
 Rakim "Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it 
 This is how it should be done" 
 50 Cent "I'm serious man, I'm so sincere" 
 [Verse Two]: 
 Rockabye, pop rapper to sleep, heavenly conscious 
 Melodies monstrous, R's one hell of an artist 
 Syllable dart smith, lyrical bars pimp caution 
 Beware of close proximity cause conflicts 
 Even through all this 
 Garbage, nonsense, media sponsors 
 I'm gonna spit the raw shit, regardless 
 My thoughts in cockpit 
 Steering past and judge through the darkness 
 While nerds be writing blurbs in office 
 I am return of the legendary, duck through the cemetery 
 Soul of the ghost in my bones, so I never worry 
 UHH, I think they want the new Makaveli 
 I can really feel the pains and the strains to my belly 
 Hunger gettin' deadly, ain't a killer, don't tempt me 
 Fill the booth cause the youth mental fridge on empty 
 Opinion on my rap, the flow's ether, the soul seeker 
 Born leader, R-E-K-S remember the name 
 (Scratch Chorus) 
 Big Pun "Say Goodnight" 
 Rakim "Drop the mic you shouldn't be holding it 
 This is how it should be done" 
 Xzibit "Dropping bows on 'em, I like to catch them 
 While they slippin'" 
 Big Pun "Say Goodnight" 
 Rakim "Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it 
 This is how it should be done" 
 50 Cent "I'm serious man, I'm so sincere" 
 [Verse Three]: 
 Yo, I think I wanna kill Bill O'Riley 
 187 G-Dub, peel wheels on dunallis 
 Mommy I'm sorry, but when these dudes rap 
 I be thinkin' that I should pull a Shyne in the party 
 Nickel nine in the audience of weak rap shows 
 I never needed guns, but as my stress grows 
 Need that East-swag back, a new West coast 
 80% of the new South rap shit blows 
 Now the Midwest, shinin', respect to grindin' 
 But turn up my face, the bullshit rap-whinin' 
 UHH, say goodnight to the industry, DJ Premier sentenced me 
 To prepare, something lethal for they ears 
 Here it is for the people, compare me to no other artist 
 I swear no equals, I hear their public opinion 
 On my rap, say the future of the game 
 Top 10 D.O.A. - Reks, remember the name 
 (Scratch Chorus)

 While they slippin'" 
 Big Pun "Say Goodnight" 
 Rakim "Drop the mic, you shoudn't be holding it 
 This is how it should be done"
