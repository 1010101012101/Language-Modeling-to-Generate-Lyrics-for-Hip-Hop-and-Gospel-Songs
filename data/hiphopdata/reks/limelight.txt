Oh, what a marvelous thing my dear 
 To be among glorious stars in here 
 The limelight, the limelight 
 Say, ta ta, fading stars 
 Never wanna say it's over love 
 The limelight, the limelight 
 Excuse me, Niki, would you please, Minaj me? 
 And quickly, I promise not to bring Eric with me 
 Eric is respected, I am surprised, evidently 
 You've ever heard of Rakim, please, tell me how come? 
 I love it when you're rocking but my niggers say it's du du 
 Young money, old money, I get it true, true 
 The money then power respect, thanks Kimberley 
 Gotta make the money so somebody remembers me 
 Lyrics ain't gonna cut it, fuck it, I can just simply 
 Sell out to sell out crowds with a recipe 
 I see my destiny, star on a boardwalk 
 Grammy night, walkin' my family down the red carp 
 Simon Cowell, next American Idol is Reks, dog 
 I know you must think its utterly unjust, bla bla 
 Iata, iata, iata, I'm a rhymers rhymer 
 And I find the need to keep [unverified] 
 Oh, what a marvelous thing my dear 
 To be among glorious stars in here 
 The limelight, the limelight 
 Say, ta ta, fading stars 
 Never wanna say it's over love 
 The limelight, the limelight 
 Pardon me, Taylor, but it's fairer for us to share the stage for a spell 
 So I can tell all the other beautiful people they are looking swell 
 New fashion fly as hell, the paparazzi get shots of my apparel 
 That's apparel for losers, apparently 
 You just ain't hip to the newest influences 
 Twitter, twitter, how I love my twit 
 I spit a little better [unverified] 
 I go to TMZ, Vlad TV, gotta get the latest in beef 
 And fabulous gossip just to talk shit 
 When I text, watch as the LOL's add up 
 A nigga feel glad 'cause technology is sweet 
 Come follow me on facebook even if we never speak 
 Career, success, they meet 
 We popping show off barbeque to Boston 
 Awesome glamor and glits, I'm handling my shit so 
 Oh, what a marvelous thing my dear 
 To be among glorious stars in here 
 The limelight, the limelight 
 Say, ta ta, fading stars 
 Never wanna say it's over love 
 The limelight, the limelight 
 Lookin' at the XXL freshmen ten, oh well 
 Maybe next year when the showoff sell 
 A bunch of records off the shelf 
 I be on the cover with 'em 
 'Cause I give 'em something totally different 
 You know that, feel good rhythm 
 Used to hit 'em well, now they got the digital [unverifed] 
 Fuck a major, put it online it still sell 
 Homie on the twitter get the link 
 Cop a nigga tape on the itunes, you tuned to youtube 
 Improve my views, great 
 The hate even a blessing 'cause it give me a discussion 
 Will he make? It is the question 
 They say, Reks cool, but J Cole best reppin' 
 I like Cole, he cold fa show, check out the weapon 
 Tell Nas, Diddy, tell Dre, Reks, he a weapon 
 And I'm stepping in the limelight, sign the unsigned like 
 Oh, what a marvelous thing my dear 
 To be among glorious stars in here 
 The limelight, the limelight 
 Say, ta ta, fading stars 
 Never wanna say it's over love 
 The limelight, the limelight
