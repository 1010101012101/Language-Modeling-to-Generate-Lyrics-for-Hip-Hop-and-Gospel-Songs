Hmm, heh, stay wiv me 
 Loud house and chains and swangin thangs (I gots ta have it) 
 Just another young nigga havin' thangs made 
 Time plans change and change comes with time 
 Throughout these years I learned to get down for mine 
 Had to do some crime 
 With the attitude of not givin' a fuck 
 Born with no luck, refuse to stay stuck 
 I make the bucks 
 Did what I had to, I did what I could 
 My rise to the top was no surprise 'cause I knew dat I would 
 Make it, oh, the chance I had to take it 
 Fake it, never 
 Because that nigga was too clever 
 If there ever was a motherfuckin die for his crime 
 It had to be me, the B-I-G Mike and he straight G 
 Come sun down, come sun up, gun up 
 For dem niggas who wanna run up 
 Wishin my colly came up short, that nigga done what? 
 Fool, you think black nigga don't go for no losses 
 I had ta get rid of my runners so I recruited mo' horses 
 Down wit neighbourhood bouncers I made a connection in rows 
 Laid up with elbows in vogues 
 I just kick back and stack rows and hoes 
 Loud house and chains and swangin thangs (Stay wiv me) 
 Just another young nigga havin' thangs made (I gots ta have it) 
 Loud house and chains and swangin thangs (All my stuff here like that) 
 Just another young nigga havin' thangs made 
 Times are changin, I'm livin' my life in and out the dope, black! 
 Loungin here and there somethin' screamin in my ear 
 "Michael go back home!" but I ain't really sure, black 
 I gots ta get my shit together the right way, nigga I know that 
 Comin' up short, swangin by the tail-in 
 Thinkin' of a masterplan, this nigga's bailin 
 Down the road and I promise not to look back 
 At what I once had, what I have now, would've left left when I was two, 
 Black 
 Shook that, now I'm in my own realm 
 Controllin shit, kickin it, never knew life could be so damn well 
 I got mine, everything feelin' lime 
 Time for a change and change comes with time 
 Loud house and chains and swangin thangs (They done) 
 Just another young nigga havin' thangs made (Hmm!) 
 Loud house and chains and swangin thangs (Fool!) 
 Just another young nigga havin' thangs made 
 Lock another nigga up, throw away the fuckin' key 
 That's the way they punish me, motherfuck society 
 I can spend a century in a penetentiary 
 It won't make a difference G 
 'Cause ain't nobody missin' me 
 Round and round and round we go, a diff'rent day, a diff'rent face 
 Damn I wish I could run away, I hate this motherfuckin place 
 Too many goddamn rules that's why I quit school 
 Givin' me a quickie test, I ain't no damn fool 
 Can't walk out my house because they always in my face 
 And if I step outta place, they wanna give me a case 
 Ain't no difference between society and a jail house 
 Everybody's locked up and wanna get the hell out 
 Just 'cause you ain't locked down you think you got it good 
 But you better think again 'cause the police are checkin' niggas in the 
 Neighbourhood 
 Beatin' our ass down 
 'Cause society is just like the pen so get ready for the lock-down 
 Clock now while you can, man huh 
 'Cause it's all about havin' thangs 
 An' I'ma get mine fool! 
 Time for a change and change changes with time 
 Loud house and chains and swangin thangs (Hmm) 
 Just another young nigga havin' thangs made
