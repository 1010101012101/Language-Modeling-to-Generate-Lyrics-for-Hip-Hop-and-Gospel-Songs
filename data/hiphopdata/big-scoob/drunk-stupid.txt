(Verse 2: Tech N9ne) 
 Say mang, doctor said I need an uh uh uh uh uh 
 'Gnac-ya-atomy ??fats and raggedy?? 
 That's the agony that I be feelin' when Jack's the strategy 
 When life is taxin' gotta be hennessy lemon and sprite inside of me 
 That's reality, god damn 
 Empty faces, I be will feelin' when him be late 
 My family, homies, and friends debate 
 My manager trippin' when him be ?? 
 All of my efforts to get my liquor 
 He don't want me to KC tea lemon twist my liver 
 But fuck that, can't drink enough 'gnac 
 All I need is a bad bitch in my britches to suck it out my nutsack 
 When I'm on tour keep 'em comin' is the motto 
 But when I'm in Germany, homie we drinkin' desperados beer 
 We hit the fuckin' lotto here 
 Because It's mixed with tequila, come take a swallow dear 
 Can't get enough 'tron 
 In the mornin if my mouth washed and stuff gon 
 I gargle hennessey and get the fuck on.
