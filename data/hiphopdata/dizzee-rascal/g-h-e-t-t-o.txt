One, two... straight up. 
 Attack foots, attack monster. 
 Mtv in the building, 
 Check it. 
 I'm g.h.e.t.t.o please don't act like you don't know 
 I stay called up when I roll, 
 I'm alot of things but I'm not slow 
 I'm g.h.e.t.t.o hot and still my heart is cold, 
 I've been known to lose control 
 Cause problems everywhere I go. 
 Don't give a damn whos got all that 
 Don't give a damn whos got whos back 
 Don't give a damn about no loose chat 
 I'm a bad boy and I'm all that 
 Don't give a damn who thinks there hot 
 I can tell whos real and whos not 
 Don't give a damn what tools you got 
 Sword in ma trousers who wants what 
 Don't give a damn about bars and clubs 
 Don't give a damn if you know thugs 
 Don't give a damn if you sell drugs 
 Don't give a damns if you are sluts 
 Don't give a damn how street you are 
 Don't give a damn how cheap you are 
 Don't give a damn how deep you are 
 I'll show you what a chief you are 
 'Cause 
 I'm g.h.e.t.t.o please don't act like you don't know 
 I stay called up when I roll, 
 I'm alot of things but I'm not slow 
 I'm g.h.e.t.t.o hot and still my heart is cold, 
 I've been known to lose control 
 Cause problems everywhere I go. 
 Stand up tall, you fool, 
 I'm blessed almighty like Sunday school 
 Cold like winter, not cool 
 Flexed like seamen, I'm on the ball 
 So many others with material 
 How many flex like dizzee rascal 
 Don't follow any rule, not at all 
 Keep my eyes wide open clock it all 
 Can't stop me don't watch me 
 Black faced cockney, ever so cocky 
 Trust me, I'm a hustler, don't knock me, 
 Don't back down, easy step properly 
 Broad daylight robbery 
 I've been a thug, MC's don't bother me 
 Done with the snobbery 
 Neighbourhood nuscience 
 These bros ain't forgotten me 
 I'm g.h.e.t.t.o please don't act like you don't know 
 I stay called up when I roll, 
 I'm alot of things but I'm not slow 
 I'm g.h.e.t.t.o hot and still my heart is cold, 
 I've been known to lose control 
 Cause problems everywhere I go. 
 I like to move it move it 
 You want me, prove it 
 You got a problem don't excuse it 
 You got a 9mm, it's a parogative 
 Use it, your got a temper, lose it 
 If not just bounce to the music 
 That's a better dress anyway choose it 
 'Cause you know that you can't refuse it 
 Watch the beat how I bruise it 
 What I like, well nod your head stupid 
 I ain cupid, no love lost 
 I get paid at the end what ever the cost 
 I'm the boss, still work for me 
 Don't stand lookin' pretty like kate moss 
 Put your hands up like you ain't got a choice 
 I bet you know I'm gunna get my point across 
 I'm g.h.e.t.t.o please don't act like you don't know 
 I stay called up when I roll, 
 I'm alot of things but I'm not slow 
 I'm g.h.e.t.t.o hot and still my heart is cold, 
 I've been known to lose control 
 Cause problems everywhere I go. 
 Highly fasionable, irrational, international, 
 Kill the classical, love theatrical, tactical 
 Keep coming with your hits 
 I've smacked them all 
 I'm not wasteful, I'm tasteful 
 Untraceble, but irreplaceable 
 And I ain't peaceful, I'm leaful 
 Entertain for all, but unattainable 
 No one's door mat, I'll die before that 
 Ignore that, a war before that, 
 I'm sure that, I got the game 
 Ill lock keep score of that 
 Dizzee rascal on the footsy format 
 I'm gunna go ride with the mahaga 
 These fake MC's gotta try that 
 There really on my level with spider 
 I'm g.h.e.t.t.o please don't act like you don't know 
 I stay called up when I roll, 
 I'm alot of things but I'm not slow 
 I'm g.h.e.t.t.o hot and still my heart is cold, 
 I've been known to lose control 
 Cause problems everywhere I go
