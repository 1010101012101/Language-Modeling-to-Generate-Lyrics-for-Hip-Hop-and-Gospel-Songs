 Yo! Look! 
 Dillan's on a hype now 
 I see you doin' quite all right 
 I see your video da other night 
 How did he get a record deal 
 Chattin' like he's super-real 
 I see you roam around market 
 On Saturday there you go 
 Better Dillan days standin' in da park 
 What's da word on da street 
 Did he really slap her?!? 
 Is true Wiley skipped da country left him?!? 
 Did he punch Mega in da face for tryin' to test him?!? 
 I know he won a mercury award and brought it back to da estate 
 I know some broad's in da manner hate and frequently debate 
 Da way he makes moves 
 How's he steppin' is he reppin' 
 Cause dey know he goes to Hackney 
 And dey wonder what he's getting' 
 Plus I know he had dat Wall St. gat 
 Da other day I see him leavin' Natalie's flat 
 He used to work dat south girl 
 Da mouthy one 
 What's his name's cousin 
 Still I know a couple girls are on it 
 I could name a dozen 
 But he ain't no player 
 He be getting' all da gash 
 Cause now dey know he's got a little 
 Cash and a stash 
 Dat will keep him looking' pretty for da future in a flash 
 But little do dey know he's only looking' for da lash 
 Cause Dillan's on a hype now! 
 Got his face on his tee-shirt name on his trainers da edieah! 
 He got a new era cap wit his logo 
 My bredrin's saw him tryin' on tracksuits in soho 
 I'm buyin' jackets from Benenni in LA 
 I heard he went to broadway 
 Limo drive him through Queens 
 Is he livin' out his dream is he ballin' be truthful 
 'Cause he ain't sittin' on da wall like he used to 
 He was on a far tip at one point 
 He used to peel on Volvo to take da flows to Bethal Green 
 Next thing I hear him on da pirate radio scene 
 He used to do deja writ an evil flavour 
 Bought records off target and mix an a-Dub 
 Then worked his way to A list 
 It's funny cause da older's used to dismiss 
 Dey never for a second anticipated this 
 Not guts no glory 
 Dillan took a risk took da piss now 
 Fella's wanna act nigga 
 If I reminisce on days when Dillan weren't all so crystal 
 Dey know Dillan put da game on a twist and 
 Dillan's on a hype now! 
 Worldwide interviews and business trips 
 Invitations to premiers and new flicks 
 And all da chicks got his name on their lips 
 But couple gunman kinda got him on da brain 
 And also da couples wanna put him on frame 
 Dey're constantly watchin' so he better maintain 
 But he's getting' major money so he can't complain!
