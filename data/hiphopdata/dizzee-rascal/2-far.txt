 You really don't have to do this, 
 Why do people jus ask for things when they don't really want it 
 They should jus shut up 
 Uh uh uh uh (whaaat) uh uh (I'm your fitness instructor) uh uh uh uh

 Yo, I don't promote no violence but if that boy gets arrogant I'll 
 Leave that boy in the basement so, 
 Done with the bat dnt talk jus walk 
 I'm not a female beater but if that girl gets facety I'll 
 Slap that girl all hasty 'cause she might be buff but she's not ruff 
 I can't believe I'm hearing that boy thinks I'm not dangerous 
 Let me draw his girlfriend home cut no slack she'll never go back 
 Marriage, love, wife please! 
 All that talk is stupid plus I don't believe in cupid 'cause 
 Sometimes most times everyone 2 times 
 Who do they think they are 
 U push me too far 
 LOOK I don't care who you are 
 NO I'm a super, superstar 
 Who do they think they are 
 U push me too far 
 LOOK I don't care who you are 
 NO 
 Yo, yo I don't obey no policemen 'cause they forget they're human uh 
 Get excited quickly but, he ain't got a gun I'll kick him and run (tell him) 
 Don't talk to me about royalty 'cause queen elizabeth don't know me so 
 How can she control me when I live street and she lives neat 
 I love raising concerts but there's jus too much violence uh 
 I can't stand no long ting so 
 Book me, watch me, hear me, pay me 
 I've been far too friendly now 
 Everybody wants a favour but I'm not no one's saviour 'cause 
 Where was you when I was blue?! 
 Yo, talk in the mike I'll talk neat 
 Talk to your wife I'll talk sweet 
 Talkin' tough I'll talk wid my feet 
 Rascals raw like red meat 
 Talk act talk rough 
 Talk sexy talk buff 
 Certain girls talk rough 
 Talk anything, anywhere, any stuff 
 Yeah we got style, we'll get gash 
 Yeah we got style, we'll make cash 
 Certain man talk trash 
 Act funny act flash 
 Bring your bora, bring your mash 
 Get banged, get bashed 
 We don't care who they are, where they are 
 If they wanna bring the beef we ain't far

 I was hot steppin in my nike air sneaker 
 You didn't know I was an MC beater, defeater 
 Giving the MC a sleeper 
 I'm in to win fairly I'm not a cheater 
 I'm starving, hungry ready to eat her 
 Your drinks sweet but my drinks sweeter though 
 I'm getting stronger bro your getting weaker bro 
 I came straight from the gutter lay low 
 I'm a ninja turtle you can't step into my circle 
 In a sound clash I will hurt you 
 Paper that's what I'm lookin' for 
 Anyone wanna make paper they got they're face on the floor and choong 
 That's what a want 
 I wanna choong ting a double bed fling with a choong ting 
 Wiley, rascal that's the bum ting 
 Gyal wanna bang on my endz 
 No long ting! 
 Shut up no one can't say nothing ever 
 I'm your fitness instructor
