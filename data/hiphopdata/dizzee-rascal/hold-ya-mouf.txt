(Dizzee Rascal) 
 Get me 
 We got a lot to talk bout 
 Raskit, God's Gift 
 Oi yo 
 What you do will come back to you 
 What you do will come back to you 
 What you do will come back to you 
 What you do will come back to you 
 What you do will come back to you 
 What you do will come back 
 Hold your mouf (hold your mouf) 
 Raskit don't give a shit (I mean) 
 Ain't concerned, ain't worried, don't mind 
 But you should watch your lip (I mean) 
 If you keep chattin in a hurry you'll find 
 The bottom of a 6 foot pit (I mean) 
 Don't care what creed, colour or kind 
 Bullets'll make you sit (I mean) 
 Make you relax, lay-down, unwind 
 Raskit don't give a damn (I mean) 
 Ain't that bothered not much, don't care 
 Catch me if you can (I mean) 
 Its possible you will get hit with a chair 
 Talk like your the man (I mean) 
 If you want beef you'll get a fair share 
 Dizzee got a masterplan (I mean) 
 I'm a problem for Antony Blair 
 Raskit don't have a bar (I mean) 
 Don't have it from him, her or dem 
 I'll make a rudeboy say rarr (I mean) 
 With or without the use of a skeng 
 Remove you from your car (I mean) 
 Got a temper, its big like ben 
 And I don't care who you are (I mean) 
 Move to your boys, I'll move to your men 
 Raskit don't waste time (I mean) 
 Don't hesitate, don't pet, don't ramp 
 .22, .38, .9 (I mean) 
 These digits'll leave you stiff like cramp 
 You wanna test? that's fine (I mean) 
 You couldn't take Dizzee Rascal for a tramp 
 If you cross my line (I mean) 
 I'll leave you colourful, dazed and damp 
 I don't want beef today 
 It's not arms today 
 Let's keep it calm today 
 Let's be friends 
 I don't wanna write today 
 Let's not fight today 
 I feel all right today 
 Let's be friends 
 (God's Gift) 
 You've got a problem blud? 
 Let's solve it blud 
 Gats and bora's blud 
 Hold your mouf 
 You've got a problem blud? 
 Let's solve it blud 
 Gats and bora's blud 
 Hold your mouf 
 (Dizzee Rascal) 
 Yo, it don't make no sense to me 
 Why fellas don't wanna act sensibly 
 You better re-check your identity 
 You better re-check how you speak 
 You don't make no sense to me 
 If I switch I won't act sensibly 
 I'll make you care intensively 
 You'll be in a coma for a week 
 And I really can't come to grips 
 With how these fellas act just like chicks 
 But now I retaliate with clips 
 And now I retaliate with force 
 You should come to grips 
 With how you really should watch your lips 
 You better know we're some lunatics 
 And that we retaliate, of course 
 (God's Gift)
