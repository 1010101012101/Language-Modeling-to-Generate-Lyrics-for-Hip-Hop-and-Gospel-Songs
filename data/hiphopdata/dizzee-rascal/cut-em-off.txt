Uh, I socialise and review the situation (Negotiate) 
 I socialise and review the situation (Negotiate) 
 I socialise and review the situation (Negotiate) 
 Then cut em' off, review the situation, take part, take over (Socialise and negotiate) 
 Review the situation, take part, take over (I cut 'em off, I cut 'em off) (Socialise and negotiate) 
 Review the situation, take part, take over (I cut 'em off, I cut 'em off) (Socialise and negotiate) 
 Review the situation, take part, take over (I cut 'em off, I cut 'em off) 
 My name is Raskit, listen to my flow 
 I socialise in Hackney and Bow 
 I wear my trousers ridiculously low 
 I love females, money and creps 
 I'm kind of street-wise, I think that you should know 
 You're not a bad boy, you're puttin' on a show 
 You're talkin' 'bout creepin' up on Rusko 
 So keep creep crawlin', 'cause I'm talkin' bigger steps 
 My name is Raskit, listen to my slang 
 I socialise with the crew and the gang 
 Roll utes on the street is where I hang 
 I'll make you collapse, leave gaps in your face 
 You're in your neighbourhood thinkin' that you're nang (Oh please) 
 Got your people thinkin' that I'm dang (Oh please) 
 But if you try it, I'll make a rachet bang (Oh no) 
 You can never outplay me, I'm a ace 
 I'm not a smoker but I blaze a lot 
 Sit around puffin', waste my days a lot 
 Although I shouldn't waste time, 'cause I ain't got a lot 
 I'm just lazy 
 I'm not a rachet but I bang a lot 
 Got a couple beanies that I slam a lot 
 I'll make 'em happy with my fingers and my hand a lot (Finger) 
 I'm just crazy 
 Socialise, negotiate 
 We cut 'em off, we cut 'em off 
 Socialise, negotiate 
 I cut 'em off, yo uh 
 Review the situation, take part, take over 
 Review the situation, take part, take over 
 Review the situation, take part, take over 
 Review the situation, take part, take over 
 There you go again, talkin' like a div (Shit) 
 Like I can't find out where you live (Man, it's easy) 
 Take off your latch, I don't even need a ratch 
 My butterfly leave you lookin' like a sieve 
 Met bad boys from every postcode (Uh) 
 You could never talk to me about road 
 Stop dreamin', I'm your worst nightmare 
 I'm Freddy Krueger, make the Luger explode 
 There you go again, talkin' like a star 
 Like I can't find out where you are 
 Kick off your door, I ain't got a .44 
 I'll have to settle for a long metal bar and 
 I've met bad boys from every rough ends 
 You could never talk to me about skengz (Click click) 
 Talk tough, but you ain't sayin' much 
 I'll chop you up and share you out between your friends 
 Now some love me, some do the opposite 
 If you feel to move to me, please get on with it 
 Don't know why you feel the need to talk to birds 
 But talk is dangerous, be careful with your words 
 But remember this, I am you 
 So if you think you're real, do what you gotta do 
 On a level, you're just challengin' yourself 
 If you're feelin' brave, go ahead and hurt yourself 
 Socialise, negotiate 
 We cut 'em off, we cut 'em off 
 Socialise, negotiate 
 Cut 'em off, uh yo 
 Review the situation take part take over

 Review the situation, take part and take over, nothin' else 
 We cut 'em off, we cut 'em off, we cut 'em off, we cut 'em off
