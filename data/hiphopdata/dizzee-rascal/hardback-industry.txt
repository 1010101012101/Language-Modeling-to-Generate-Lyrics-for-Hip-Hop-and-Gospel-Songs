 First up, it's important that you keep your shit original, try and keep that copycat shit to a minimal 
 People want something that they never heard before, if it's been done leave it they don't wanna hear no more 
 Secondly, here's another clever thing that you can do, find yourself a good manager who's really got a clue 
 Cause there's so many to choose from, they all look the part, but it's difficult to come across the ones that's really smart 
 And can stand firm and steady when the label's talking shit, will respect it, keeps it gangsta, but does everything legit 
 And dependable, you can trust to handle your biz, and can really make you sure of what the situation is 
 Next up, find a record label that ain't full of pricks, one that lets you breathe artistically but makes you come with hits 
 Congratulations now you've got your deal you're set to go, lemme fill you in on just a couple things you need to know

 Next up change your number change your phone and change your chip, 'cause there's gonna be a lot of people ringing talking shit 
 Whether bredrens wanting money 'cause now suddenly you're rich, or some dumb hating fassies tryin' to take you for a bitch 
 Yeah I know it's minor and you can handle it, it's nothing, but eventually you're really gonna wanna do something 
 And that's counter-productive, beefin' over bullshit, you can never stop those dumb ? tryin' to bullshit 
 Plus you're in the limelight, well-paid verbalist, which leads me onto my next subject; journalists 
 These are the people that could put your name about, so be careful what you're saying when you're talking out your mouth 
 An' avoid bein' ignorant, tone down the thug-shit, come to interviews buzzin - tone down the drug shit 
 Keep your eye on the ball, mind on the job, and before you know you'll have the whole world on your knob

 Here's something that I shoulda stressed early on, don't go spending all your money till it's gone 
 'Cause the tax man's gonna want his paper when it's due, and there's nobody above the tax man especially you 
 And another thing, buy your house before you buy your car, don't tell no one where you are, even better if you're far 
 Everybody knows you're gangsta and that porsche looks great, but do you really want it sitting on that council estate? 
 Differently, watch where you choose to socialise, keep an eye out for trouble, watch for devils in disguise 
 Please don't be fooled by no pretty females, play it safe, never let 'em know your full details 
 I ain't saying be para' I just sayin' be sure, you can never know if that bitch will be braggin what she saw 
 And aside from making money keep loving what you do, I ain't saying nothing more because the rest is up to you
