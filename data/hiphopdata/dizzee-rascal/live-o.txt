I don't wanna screw, but nothin' ain't new 
 I'll educate your whole crew when I come through 
 And you know its true, so what you gonna do? 
 You ain't got the foggiest, ain't got a clue 
 Got a little fame and yeah I got game 
 Get out my way with your dangerous for my name 
 All I gotta say, get out the way 
 Dizzee Rascal's hot like summer bay 
 And I hit MC's like croquet 
 If a boy pet then a boy must pay 
 You can start arms, we're not on the lay-lay 
 Please feel free, you can bring it any day 
 Anyway, get wet like Perrier 
 Better hope there's an ambulance on the way 
 OK if you wanna fight, just say 
 We uppercut MCs like Sugar Ray 
 Hot like Cairo, hot like Mars 
 But I want houses and I want cars 
 So I spit verses and a spit bars 
 I don't care what they're sayin' 
 I ain't playin' 
 Hot like lava, hot like hell 
 Move to your sister 
 Move to your girl 
 Charmeyne, Cherellene or Chantelle 
 You better hide your wife 
 Protect her well 
 Killer instinct, instinctive killer 
 Round here life can't get no realer 
 Young-guns flappin their gums wit no fear 
 Females, money and guns it's all here 
 Top shottas, beer caps, street rats 
 Bent coppers aim for your knee-caps 
 Some pay a visit to jail without bail 
 Some stay on top of the game without fail 
 Its live-o (its live-o) its live-o (its live-o) its live-o 
 Look, skank out (skank out) skank out (skank out) 
 Skank out (skank out) and jump about 
 See-saw Marjore glore 
 Guess who's sneaked in through the back door 
 Born with a hack-saw through a trap door 
 Dizzee got a cheek and not much more 
 What's that? violence? what's that? war? 
 Put him in a headlock, see if hes raw 
 I cause arms house on the dancefloor 
 Set trend, set standard, set score 
 Spin that bottle, nah dash that bottle 
 Talk tough but you ain't got no bottle 
 Get strangled, get hold, get throttled 
 Dizzee come old skool like Aristotle 
 Blue-bottle flyin about in 6 zones 
 Eyes right, hope its sticks out, collar bone 
 We take girls from broken homes 
 Big batty's, big breast, light skin-tones 
 Its live-o (its live-o) its live-o (its live-o) its live-o 
 Look, skank out (skank out) skank out (skank out) 
 Skank out (skank out) and jump about (movin') 
 Didn't wanna listen, didn't wanna care 
 Left that boy in a gutter somewhere 
 When I talk live-o, when I talk rare 
 I'll make you wish you were born elsewhere 
 I gotta wash that girl out my hair 
 She's old news, everyone's been there 
 No, we're not equal, no, we're not fair 
 That girl's anything, she gets air 
 That MC is dowd 
 Tell 'em I said it and I said it real loud 
 Goin' on rowdy, goin' on rowd 
 That boy tried it, that boy failed 
 Sorry? pardon? what? 
 Coulda got borred up, coulda got shot 
 Gunman get gunned down on the spot 
 Who's hot? who's a badboy? who's not? 
 Its live-o (its live-o) its live-o (its live-o) its live-o 
 Look, skank out (skank out) skank out (skank out) 
 Skank out (skank out) and jump about 
 (We're movin now, Dizzee Rascal in this, ya get me, get me)
