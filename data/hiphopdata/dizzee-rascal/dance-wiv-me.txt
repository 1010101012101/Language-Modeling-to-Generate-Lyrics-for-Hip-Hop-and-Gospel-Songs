Dizzee Rascal 
 What's up, darling? 
 I've been keeping my eyes on your movements 
 I can't see no room for improvement 
 But why you all alone over there on your Jack Jones? 
 You need to let me get behind your backbones 
 'Cause I'm the man for the job, let me work it 
 I won't waste no time, I'll make it worth it 
 One hundred percent, I'll make it perfect 
 You got a body to die for, let me mark it 
 Now it's murder on the dance floor 
 I want to take this further than the dance floor 
 I ain't forcefield but I'm still hardcore 
 You're going to give me everything I ask for 
 It's not a long t'ing, you're a boomt'ing 
 Maybe more than a hotel room t'ing 
 I'll never know if I just walk past 
 I really want to dance, so I guess I'll just ask 
 Chrome 
 She ain't no, oh 
 Look at those thighs 
 It's in her eyes, she's good to go 
 She can satisfy my mind, body and soul 
 Dizee Rascal 
 Come and dance with me 
 Come and dance with me 
 Come and dance with me 
 Come dance with me 
 I see you glance at me 
 That's why I'm asking, B 
 So let's party, B 
 Come and dance with me

 If I'm out on my own 
 Then I can look at you, looking at me 
 If I'm out on a date 
 Then I just shut my eyes, then I can't see 
 Get away from the bar 
 Tell your boyfriend to hold your jar 
 And dance with me

 Come and dance with me 
 Yo! It goes on and on 
 I see you get excited like, this is my song 
 You think I want to get involved, you're not wrong 
 'Cause I've been waiting for this moment all night long 
 So I creep, creep, creep like TLC 
 I've got my left eye checking out your scenery 
 I've got my right eye right where it needs to be 
 No matter how I look at it, you look good to me 
 Still, I'm looking for the perfect view 
 The way I see it, that's right next to you 
 I know you've probably heard it before, but I still 
 I love the way you flex like that for real 
 So don't stop doing what you do when you do it 
 I just wanna be a part of it when you do it 
 I feel like a wally if I don't pursue it 
 And I can't go through it, so let's go to it

 So let's party, B 
 Come and dance with me 
 I know you didn't come out to stand and stare 
 You bought new shoes and you did up your hair 
 You made a real effort tonight and it shows 
 I can tell by your face you don't wanna be alone 
 'Cause the mood is right and the time is now 
 And if you can't do it, I'll show you how 
 All you gotta do is get loose, let go 
 Just spark up your shades, put your skills on show
