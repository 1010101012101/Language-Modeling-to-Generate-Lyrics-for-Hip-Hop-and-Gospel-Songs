You people respect me, if it kills you 
 You people respect me, if it kills you 
 You people respect me, if it kills you 
 You people respect me, if it kills you 
 You people respect me, if it kills you 
 You people respect me, if it kills you 
 You people respect me, if it kills you 
 You people respect me, if it kills you 
 Do it how they didn't wanna do it 
 Now they wanna try and do it but I'm tellin' them no 
 I'm in a predicament with imitators 
 Wanna take my style and have a bit of my flow 
 All this copy cattin' on my lyrics that there chattin' 
 Betta stop before the gunshot's blow 
 Do you really want it 'cause I really wanna give it 
 If you do just let me know 
 And I show arrogance and elegance 
 But no tolerance for nonsense 
 I bring violence, I'm a nuisance 
 Killer MC leave no evidence 
 I've got brains and intelligence 
 But no conscience, no innocence 
 We roll in the darkened silence 
 Represent us in any residence 
 And I swing for your chin with no hesitense 
 I'm a captain, ya betta bring your regiments 
 And you're a failure, don't have no relevance 
 I'm a champion, winner and a victor prick ya 
 So not ready so till ya see ya soul 
 Headed for the golden gates 
 No really, you monkeys are playin' with apes 
 Not guerilla warfare it's the coppers I carry this stick for 
 Plus I've had enough of these 
 Lil cheap comments from fake MCs 
 Bad minders and skat ladies 
 Talkin' about how it used to be 
 Well it's a brand new day 
 So leave me be 
 I don't need you so don't need me 
 Your opinion don't interest me 
 Don't like me, that's fine by me 
 'Cause from Holly Street ta Hollywood, it's all good 
 From New York ta York Hall, it's all cool 
 You're a fool if ya think I'm gonna cease 
 Now honestly could there really be peace 
 It don't seem that way to tough 
 Stop with the games I play too rough 
 Must be smokin' too much puff 
 Divert or be deceased 
 UK rapper stabbed in Napa 
 'Cause of gossip, 'cause of chatter 
 He's still breathin', he's still a dapper 
 Retaliate with gun clapper 
 Truthfully, I can't see very well 
 Don't flatter yourself, you're any girl 
 Them boys shoulda sent me ta hell 
 Now prepare for the beast 
 You people gonna respect me 
 Better make you respect me 
 You people gonna respect me 
 Better make you respect me 
 You people gonna respect me 
 Better make you respect me 
 You people gonna respect me 
 Better make you respect me 
 You people are gonna respect me if it kills you 
 You people are gonna respect me if it kills you 
 (All right verse two I swear) 
 'Ey yo endless speculation I'm facin' 
 Constant controversial relations 
 To gun crime at garage events 
 With so many claims and no evidence 
 Suggesting I'm the reason 
 For the UK gun clap season 
 I'm legal, may I stress 
 To the fool for the sake of 
 Strident intelligence 
 Go ahead check my files all day 
 Bit of criminal damage and T-D-A 
 Might be a little bit of violent disorder 
 But I ain't never been locked away 
 Got some mates that have been convicted 
 Yer, so what, it's the hand life dealt them 
 We weren't blessed with the system's T-L-C 
 Government shoulda tried ta help them 
 Been a law breaker, ain't tryna hide it 
 As for the sentence, ain't tryna ride it 
 Stop that so I could do this 
 I'm legit, ya may as well kiss my 
 A-S-S P-L-E-A-S-E I'm L-E-G-I-T 
 You ain't got nothin' on me 
 But to the pricks who think I'm slack-in 
 Please don't ever be fooled, I'm pack-in 
 This is a welcome and it's a warning 
 Please don't ever just think I'm rappin' 
 You know the score, I'm raw from day 
 Still Dylan the Villain from around the way 
 Feel free to quote anything I say 
 Please don't ever just think I'm chattin' 
 People gonna respect me 
 I better make you respect me 
 People gonna respect me 
 I better make you respect me 
 People gonna respect me 
 I better make you respect me 
 People gonna respect me 
 I better make you respect me 
 You people gonna respect me if it kills you 
 You people gonna respect me if it kills you 
 You people gonna respect me if it kills you 
 I know what you're thinkin', it's gone too far now innit 
 Fuck it 
 If I don't speak, who's gonna speak for me 
 Stand up for myself in this shit 
 So fuck you 
 Unapologetic 
 Can't be, never have been, won't be a prick 
 Yer, that's it
