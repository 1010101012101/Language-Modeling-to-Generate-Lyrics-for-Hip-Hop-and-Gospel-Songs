Money money money girls, 
 Money money money girls, 
 Money money money, girls girls, cash cash, 
 Dizzee diz I keep the money coming in, 
 Eight hundred fifty pound jeans covering my shin, 
 'Cause my legs are skinny but my wallet ain't thin, 
 Every time I bust a smile it's a big money grin, 
 And I can't stop grinning 'cause I don't stop winning, 
 Everybody wanna bring it like they knew me from beginning, 
 Change my number every week, 
 My phone don't stop dingin', 
 Gotta change my home address, 
 My bell don't stop ringin', 
 And I can't stop sinnin', 
 So I pray on the women, 
 Take 'em to the player pad, 
 For some late night swimmin', 
 Then we do the wild thing, 
 'Cause we finished skinny dippin', 
 Then I pray in the mornin', 
 That my willy ain't stingin', 
 Now she says she got a man, 
 But her heart ain't in him, 
 If he ever tries a thing, 
 Then I'm gonna have to chin him, 
 Yeah my attitudes mingin', 
 But I don't really give a friggin' ras clart, 
 'Cause I been a rude boy that's how I'm livin',

 (All right) No rims on my car no twenty-two's 
 But I had a mortgage way before I turned twenty-two 
 Any-who, really ain't concerned with who I tell it to 
 I got an attitude similar to a smelly shoe 
 If I laid my trainers out 
 I bet they stretch to Timbuktu 
 I got so many fitted hats 
 I don't know what the fuck to do 
 See me on the tele with Jeremy Paxman on the news 
 Help me raise my profile and my money 
 Don't get it confused 
 I will never lose 
 Standardly I'll always get my dues 
 You ain't never gonna catch me sleeping 
 I will never snooze 
 But you still might catch me kickin' back 
 On a luxury cruise 
 With a freaky model 
 Blowin' me like a didgeridoo 
 This is the shit that we do 
 On a regular 
 I'm tellin' ya 
 Try and play me for my money 
 And I'll put a shell in ya 
 Now people say I'm ignorant 
 They say I'm too flash 
 All I know is money money, girls girls, cash cash! 
 So I say, 
 Money money money, girls girls, cash cash,

 My, my Gucci, my my my Gucci shoes 
 My Gucci shoes make love to my big toe 
 I ain't Beckham you know I got the game plan 
 Dylan Mills or Dizzee Rascal, it's all the same, man 
 Still a name brand 
 And I ain't part of no chain gang, 
 Call me Lewis Hamilton I got my own lane man 
 Speeding down the motorway, my cars never been towed away, 
 Traffic wardens take my autograph and then they go away 
 I think I might quit music and disappear with no delay 
 And open up a shop with all the clothes that I just throw away 
 You know I stay 
 Back the the bone 
 Pockets fully blown 
 Sippin' on Patron 
 I'm like their favorite handbag 
 Girls don't want to leave me alone 
 Plus I'm pussy prone 
 Always on the bone 
 Always in the zone 
 Love 'em and I leave 'em 
 Put 'em in the taxi home 
 That's what time it is, 
 This ain't no Rolex it's a Breitling 
 Won't tell you what I paid for it because it's frightenin' 
 I flay first class 
 Eat a la carte 
 Plus I play my part 
 Modern day super star on the high thing
