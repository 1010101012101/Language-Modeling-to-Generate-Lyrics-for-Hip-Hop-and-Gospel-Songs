 You don't wanna see a road rage! 
 NAH! 
 You don't wanna see a road rage! 
 NAH! 
 You don't wanna see a road rage! 
 I'll put you in a early grave! 
 TDA TDA I'll break in your car and I'll take it away, 
 That's how I used to roll back in the day, 
 And I did it for a laugh, 
 I didn't even get paid, 
 And I couldn't give a shit about a junction, 
 Couldn't care less about a red light's function, 
 Drive sorta like I'm drunk and swervin' swervin' 
 Got 2 wheels on the kerb and 
 Murdering tarmac full black, 
 On my stereo full blast 2pac! 
 Holla if you hear me, 'cause I'm only gunna beep once 
 I'll knock down all of these, 
 Let down one of these, 
 Run down all of these 
 CHUMPS drive faster when I see speed bumps, 
 Killin' off stunts, 
 I'm a smart guy but if you see me drive you'll think I'm a dunce like 
 Beep! Beep! 
 Comin' through, 
 Move over, 
 Yeah you, 
 Don't argue, 
 Just blurt,

 You don't wanna see a road rage! 
 NAH! 
 You don't wanna see a road rage! 
 NAH! 
 You don't wanna see a road rage! 
 I'll put you in an early grave! 
 NEEEEEOWWW! Mind Out! 
 If you don't listen to me you'll find out, 
 I don't indicate, I just swing about taking up two lanes 
 Playing dare devil games 
 I don't give a shit 'cause my car is tinted 
 And if I get caught I don't care about minted, 
 Driving in the fast lane, 
 Ready for the violence, 
 Had 6 points before I even had a license 
 NOW I'm legit, 
 And I couldn't give a rats ass, 
 All I see is flashlights 'cause I drive too fast, 
 But I'm still a trooper, 
 In ma mini cooper, 
 Went head to head had a crash with a police car, 
 Didn't get arrested, 
 Didn't have to kick off, 
 I was all right but the car got write off, 
 Just another day in the life of a lunatic, 
 Rub me up the wrong way watch me start losing it like... 
 Beep! Beep! 
 Comin' through, 
 Move over, 
 Yeah you, 
 Don't argue, 
 Just blurt, 
 Hurry up you gunna get HURT! 
 You don't wanna see a road rage! 
 NAH! 
 You don't wanna see a road rage! 
 NAH! 
 You don't wanna see a road rage! 
 I'll put you in an early grave! 
 MOVE 
 When you see me coming down the road, 
 Mind out 
 When you see me coming down the road, 
 Couldn't give a shit when I'm driving down the road, 
 This is a warning you've been told, 
 Neoooow! Move over! 
 Neoooow! Move over! 
 Neoooooooooooow! Move over! 
 Neoooooooooooow! Move over! 
 Driving with my lights in the daytime, 
 Everybody looking at me, Crazy! 
 WHAT! 
 I put my middle finger in the sky above 
 If I see flashing lights I just might not stop, 
 Lets go for a joyride, 
 Speed through the ghetto, 
 I'll say goodbye before I even say hello, 
 I'm far from mellow! 
 I don't wanna chat, 
 I'll get out ma car and give you a slap, 
 Never mind all that 'cause you really ain't ready tho, 
 I'm so high, 
 I just wanna hear ma stereo, 
 But I got my girl moanin in my left ear, 
 There's a lot of stress here, you better steer clear, 
 Car just cut me up, I didn't take kindly 
 Plus I got this other silly BASTARD behind me, 
 Had enough of being courteous and smiley, blimely 
 Now I really gotta get grimey like... 
 Beep! Beep! 
 Comin' through, 
 Move over, 
 Yeah you, 
 Don't argue, 
 Just blurt, 
 Hurry up you gunna get HURT! 
 You don't wanna see a road rage!
