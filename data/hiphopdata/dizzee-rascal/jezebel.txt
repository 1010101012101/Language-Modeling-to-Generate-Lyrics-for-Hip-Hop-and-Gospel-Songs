Yo, look, look, look 
 They call her jezebel 
 You might find her in your neighbourhood 
 Always in some shit 
 Up to no good 
 Constant boastin', bragging to her friends 
 Juiced every boy in the ends 
 Didn't finished school 
 She would truant every day 
 Always on the link 
 Different boy every day 
 Missed mathematics she was doing acrobatics 
 But not gym class 
 She was gettin' doggie fast 
 Yo, they call her jezebel 
 Friends call her sket behind her back 
 She never knew the plot 
 She was born off track 
 Tight top short skirt thinks she's to nice 
 Hates love but she's been deep in twice 
 Pass with, hoe can't keep her legs closed 
 Always on the creep 
 Now she's in too deep 
 Now she face's neglect, abuse and rape 
 Man said that he'd kill her 
 If she tried to escape 
 What's your name? 
 I've seen you about 
 I think your shroom (Boom ting) 
 I really hope your not a grim 
 I really hope your not a jezzy, jezzy 
 Where you from? 
 Hot stuff (Buff ting) 
 I really hope your not a grim 
 I really hope your not a jezzy, jezzy 
 I've seen you around 
 I think your shroom (Boom ting) 
 I really hope your not a grim 
 I really hope your not a jezzy, jezzy 
 Where you from? 
 Hot stuff (Buff ting) 
 I really hope your not grim 
 I really hope your not a jezebel 
 You might find her at a house rave 
 For the fifth time 
 She's gettin' wined from behind 
 Had a bit to drink 
 So she's acting kinda slow 
 She came with Natasha 
 But she's leavin' with Joe 
 Ricky loves jezzy but jezzy loves bling 
 Ricky means well but Ricky ain't got a thing 
 Joe's got a name 
 And jezzy loves fame 
 She wants a man to show 
 So it's all about Joe 
 They call her jezebel 
 On her way to get what's out 
 Get battery 
 And get kicked out 
 Jezzy weren't expecting more then four 
 What could she say 
 She just did it anyway 
 Messed up caught a kinda STD 
 Gonorrhoea, Herpes, no VD 
 Left bitter, left angry, left vexed 
 But still loves sex 
 Passed it on to the next 
 Pretty but 
 Ain't got a brain 
 Got no shame 
 Got juiced on the train 
 Went from daddy's little girl 
 To daddy's heart attack 
 House reck a side 
 She could never go back 
 Raised in the church 
 Not knowing anything 
 Then learned about boys 
 Ruin every thing 
 Aged 16 
 She was never full grown 
 She was in a family 
 Now she's got one of her own 
 Two kids 
 Even worse 
 Two little girls 
 Two more of her 
 That's two jezebels 
 Two fatherless kids 
 One single mum 
 No longer young 
 But the boys still come 
 Yo, wishin' she could take it back to the old school 
 And make better choices 
 Oh what a fool 
 Bottle by her side 
 She wonder, man, 
 If only she were six years younger, 
 Damn
