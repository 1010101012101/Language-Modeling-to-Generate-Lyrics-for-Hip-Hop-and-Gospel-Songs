Four little words just to get me along, 
 It's a difficulty and I'm biting on my tongue, 
 And I, I keep stalling and keeping me together, 
 People around gonna' to find something to say now, 
 Holdin' back every day the same, 
 I don't want to be a loner listen to me (OH NO) 
 I never say anything at all, 
 But with nothing to say they forgot my name (Ame ame ame.) 
 They call me blud 
 They call be rudeboi 
 They call me OI 
 They call me mate 
 That's not my name, 
 That's not my name, 
 That's not my name, 
 That's not my name. 
 They call me Maiyou. 
 But I'm a fly you, 
 They use the N word like it's a game. 
 That's not my name 
 That's not my name 
 That's not my name 
 That's not my name 
 I'm mister catch if you throw me the ball, 
 I'm the last kid standing up against the wall, 
 Keep up fallin' these lights they keep be balling, 
 Getting lamped up and sitting on a fence now 
 So alone all time of night I locked myself away 
 Listen to me OH NO 
 Although I'm dressed up out and all, 
 With everything considered they forget my name (ame ame ame) 
 They call me blud 
 They call be rudeboi 
 They call me OI 
 They call me mate 
 That's not my name, 
 That's not my name, 
 That's not my name, 
 That's not my name. 
 They call me Maiyou. 
 But I'm a fly you, 
 They use the N word like it's a game.
