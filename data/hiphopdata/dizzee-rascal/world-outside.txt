I've got shit I wanna share with you 
 Couple things, explain da reasons why I can't be there with you 
 Back in da day, we both thought we'd never split past 
 Didn't see no definite endin' to da madness 'n' da lust 
 Never thought I'd be packin' 'n' jackin' for somethin' more solid 
 I ain't changed, I just found a better way to steal ma knowledge 
 Runnin' around hyper criminal had me locked for a while 
 Da studio gave me a lot, more creative style 
 Took me to another world beyond that estate 
 Some kind of haven from da beef 'n' some of da stress mate 
 I wouldn't call it no escape, da roads are in ma heart 
 Makin' it that more difficult for me to climb da chart 
 But it's da sacrifice I make, it's all good, star 
 Same reason I ain't always in da hood, star 
 I do ma thing 'n' I'm graftin' like I always was 
 It just ain't quite like it was, simply cause... 
 There's a world outside of tha manor 'n' I want you to see it 
 I can see it, I can see it, I can see it 
 There's a world outside of tha ends 'n' I want you to see it 
 I can see it, I can see it, I can see it 
 There's a world outside of tha hood 'n' I want you to see it 
 I can see it, I can see it, I can see it 
 There's a world outside of tha ghetto 'n' I want you to see it 
 I can see it, I can see it, I can see it 
 Money, cars, guns, women melts my desire 
 I'm gonna stay red blooded 'til I expire 
 Not caught up in da hype, I'm caught up in da scheme of things 
 Seen a couple figures, but I still dream of things 
 Like da kinda shit money can't connect me wiv 
 Unconditional love, I won't regret to give 
 I'm young, black, rich an' ruthless, I swear, star 
 Still if you need a helpin' hand, you know I'm there, star 
 I'm from da street, you're from da street, we all done dirt 
 Now it's time to flip da script, fuck da sufferin' 'n' da hurt 
 'Cause I've seen da bigger picture, it's all good 
 There really is a world outside of da hood 
 There's a world outside of tha manor 'n' I want you to see it 
 I can see it, I can see it, I can see it 
 There's a world outside of tha ends 'n' I want you to see it 
 I can see it, I can see it, I can see it 
 There's a world outside of tha hood 'n' I want you to see it 
 I can see it, I can see it, I can see it 
 There's a world outside of tha ghetto 'n' I want you to see it 
 I can see it, I can see it, I can see it
