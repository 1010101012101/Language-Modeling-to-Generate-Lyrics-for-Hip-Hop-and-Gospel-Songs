Oh, it's real out here 
 Like no one understands sometimes 
 People can see what's really goin' on 
 People just go in mad in front of me, you get me? 
 Everyone's growin' up too fast 
 Feds don't understand us, adults don't understand us 
 No one understands us 
 We just live life for what we do like, it's real 
 It's Raskit, shout out to all the mandem 
 Yo, I'm repping I'm trying listen, yo 
 Sometimes I wake up wishin' I could sleep forever 
 I spend my whole life tryin' to pull myself together 
 Tryin' to re-assure myself that I ain't goin' mad 
 I gotta come to a conclusion, it's now or never 
 Sometimes I wake up wishin' I could sleep for years 
 I've been through anger, pain, blood, sweat and tears 
 You'd think that any kid in my position would be glad (You would) 
 Quite the opposite, more worries, more fears 
 Sometimes I wake up wishin' I could sleep for days 
 It's like I'm lost in love and I'm only in it 'cause it pays 
 I find myself back on road, things are gettin' bad 
 More and more I'm goin' back to my old ways 
 Sometimes I wake up wishin' I could sleep for good 
 And if I had the guts to end it all, believe I would 
 Its gettin' borin' always being miserable and sad 
 Shit, I would love to be polite really I wish I could 
 But life's pressures often get me down 
 Sometimes I feel there's not a lot to smile about so I frown 
 And I talk a big whole heap of badness 
 Because my life's a big whole heap of madness 
 I've seen a lot, maybe more than I can take, real 
 I'm under pressure everyday, tryin' not to break, ooh 
 But I'll survive 'cause it's what I do best, get me 
 I'm a challenger, put me to the test 
 Sleep tight, everything will be alright 
 By the end of the night will be the day, just 
 Pray that you see it, strong you gotta be it 
 If you wanna get through it, stretch your mind to the limit 
 You can do it 
 Sleep tight, everything will be alright 
 By the end of the night will be the day, just 
 Pray that you see it, strong you gotta be it 
 If you wanna get through it, stretch your mind to the limit 
 It's almost like I got the world on my shoulders 
 Sometimes, yo, I struggle 
 Sometimes you know I'm hittin' petty crimes 
 But we livin' hard times 
 No one to turn to and no one to talk to 
 Life's a doorway, everybody walk through 
 Everybody's talkin', but nobody's listenin' 
 Everyday some new shit, week out and week in 
 All this negativity, why you tryin' to get at me? 
 All up in my life, rah, where did you get the energy? 
 I don't feel well but you still bother me 
 You're givin' me a headache man, you might as well just clobber me 
 Blud lately I've been lonely but you only phone me 
 When you want a favour then you wonder why I'm moany 
 Don't really ask much so I don't owe much 
 Don't receive a lot of love so I don't show much 
 But the little that I'll do I put it in a song for you 
 Handle your business because I do 
 Sleep tight, everything will be alright 
 By the end of the night will be the day, just 
 Pray that you see it, strong you gotta be it 
 If you wanna get through it, stretch your mind to the limit 
 You can do it 
 Sleep tight, everything will be alright 
 By the end of the night will be the day, just 
 Pray that you see it, strong you gotta be it 
 If you wanna get through it, stretch your mind to the limit 
 You can do it 
 Shout to all the youngers 
 E3, do your thing but I swear to use school 
 Get me, you come out of school, it's real out here 
 (Raskit's from Bow E3, that Dizzee Rascal from Bow E3, yo don't worry) 
 Yeah, shout to everybody still hustlin' (Think I ain't got you in mind don't worry) 
 Make it focus, I swear to you, you can do anything 
 (That Dizzee Rascal's from Bow E3) 
 Real 
 I need to talk more
