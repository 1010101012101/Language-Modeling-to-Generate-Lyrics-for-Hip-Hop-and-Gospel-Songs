Blud, when you hear them sirens coming, 
 I can hear them sirens coming, 
 Better run when you hear them sirens coming, 
 I can hear them sirens coming 
 1 to the 2 to the 3 to the 4, 
 Limewise police knocking at ma door, 
 12 black boots on ma bedroom floor, 
 What they want with Rascal I'm not sure, 
 Took me to the station, eight thirty 
 For a fight that I had recently, 
 Say they got me on CCTV, 
 And the pussy homeboyz told on me, 
 Can't understand why these boyz keep snitchin' 
 Can't understand why these boyz keep bitchin', 
 Now I'm hot tempered, feel like switchin', 
 Can't stand still, trigger finger itching, 
 Gotta stay calm, gotta keep ma cool, 
 If I go jail, I'll be a damn fool, 
 Gotta rise up, gotta stand up tall, 
 Can't let them see the end of Dizzee Rascal 
 Blud, when you hear them sirens coming, 
 I can hear them sirens coming, 
 Better run when you hear them sirens coming, 
 I can hear them sirens coming 
 Blud, when you hear them sirens coming, 
 I can hear them sirens coming, 
 Better run when you hear them sirens coming, 
 I can hear them sirens coming 
 Yo man, lets take it back to that old skool story telling shit, get me! 
 One day I was with ma bredwin Aido roaming the street, 
 On the main road, hungry, looking for something to eat, 
 Not no burger and no chips, shit that's easily digested, 
 It's that shit that if you're caught, you'll be easily arrested, 
 We was on a robbing spree, 
 I forgot to mention Clayton: was a bredda rollin' with us 
 He was scared and it was blatant; he was prang, 
 Back to the story, Aido spotted a man straight ahead of us 
 In the distance with his wifey holding hands, 
 So we followed them though this little alleyway into the flats, 
 When we thought the time was perfect, we crept up and we attacked, 
 I took the first swing, unexpected, causing panic, 
 It was ruthless, causing agony and public, it was tragic, 
 Me and Aido lost the plot, acting like we were from hell, 
 Beat this bredda to the floor, 
 Beat his wifey up as well, 
 Clayton stood back, shaken, wishing that he'd never came, 
 From out of nowhere was Aleesha screaming out my name, 
 'You're at my school', 
 She saw it all, 
 And by this time she started cryin' and to make it worse 
 I'm hearing sirens I ain't even trying to hide. 
 Blud, when you hear them sirens coming, 
 I can hear them sirens coming, 
 Better run when you hear them sirens coming, 
 I can hear them sirens coming 
 Blud, when you hear them sirens coming, 
 I can hear them sirens coming, 
 Better run when you hear them sirens coming, 
 I can hear them sirens coming 
 I can hear the sirens coming 
 I can hear the sirens coming 
 I'll break the law I will never change 
 I'll break the law I will never change 
 I'll break the law I will never change 
 Step on to my soil, you'll get your whole face rearranged 
 See me on telly, but I ain't no actor, 
 Running through the streets, bare faced as a jackhawk, 
 Broad daylight, no shame like a lunatic, 
 Rain, hail, sleet or snow, I ain't new to it, 
 Show me what you got, better give it up quickly, 
 Lay 'em on their back, if they chat back swiftly, 
 Better mind out when they come through the manor, man, 
 Keep 'em on their toes like hammer man. 
 It's no joke, man, woman and child I'm seeking, 
 See no sex, no age I'm creeping 
 Anything through the door, cold on the wheelers, 
 Duck from the feds and I roll with the dealers, 
 Fly with the hard heads and young offenders 
 Though my life ain't nothing like Eastenders, 
 Every time I get your whole face rearranged, 
 I break the law I will never change!
