Like, who the fuck are you? 
 Yeah, who the fuck are you? 
 Is it recordin', yeah? 
 I come direct when I inject 
 And I'm expecting your respect 
 I'm a baller you've been chucked, 
 I'm the kind of kid you can't protect ya know 
 Out 'n' about I put my elbow in your mouf 
 You're a fassy there's no doubt 
 I bet my sword will make you shout 
 I'm intense you best see sense, 
 I'll have you hangin' from a fence 
 Then I'll laugh at your expense 
 And maybe chuck you 50 pence 
 Snitch you make me switch you sound 
 And look just like a bitch 
 Whether you're poor or whether you're rich 
 I'll leave you lyin' in the ditch 
 'Cause I'm from ragged raggo rags 
 You wear raggo rags like me 
 I'm ahead boy, I ain't in tune 
 Rappin' raggo rapidly 
 We easily be the worst 
 Bust academics first 
 Batty crew m.c's get academicly reversed 
 I'm academicly perverse 
 Academicly perverted 
 Batty crew MC's get academicly diverted 
 Some return 
 We clearly get burnt 
 Get hurt, 
 Until they realise they should academicly have flirted 
 You don't want the beef you don't want the grime 
 You ain't got the guts I ain't got the time 
 But you can come to the man and get jacked 
 Come to the man 'n' get pill 
 Come to the man 'n' get shot 
 Come to the man 'n' get killed 
 We call it armsouse, armsouse, go 'n' get your crew 
 If you can't back that armsouse, who the fuck are you? 
 We call it armsouse, armsouse, go 'n' get your firm 
 If they don't wanna listen, then we better make 'em learn 
 Raised in the gutter I was told I should fight 
 I create and cause confusion from the left to the right 
 I'm sweet as a nut, I'm doin' all right, cosy 'n' comfortable 
 Still I try 'n' avoid the sergeant, PC and the constable 
 Raised in the gutter I was told I should bop 
 I create and cause confusion from the bottom to the top 
 I doin' ok, I will honestly say 
 This year I'm flyin' through 
 I could easily find myself in jail but I ain't tryin' to 
 I keep it clear in front, relax wid the pressure, 
 I'm dirty, and I'm stank but ain't nobody fresher 
 My haters make enquiries, make it obvious they care 
 When it comes to my location they would love to be aware 
 But I could be in the manor, could be overseas, 
 Could well be definitely making peace 
 Could be live at Wembley warmin' up for Jay-Z 
 Still I'm definitely certain that you can't see me 
 You don't want the beef, you don't want the grime 
 You ain't got the guts, I ain't got the time 
 But you can come to the man and get jacked 
 Come to the man 'n' get pill 
 Come to the man 'n' get shot 
 Come to the man 'n' get killed 
 We call it armsouse, armsouse, go 'n' get your crew 
 If you can't back that armsouse, who the fuck are you? 
 We call it armsouse, armsouse, go 'n' get your firm 
 If they don't wanna listen, then you better make 'em learn
