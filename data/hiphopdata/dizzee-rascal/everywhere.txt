I ain't on a high ting (Nah!) 
 Jus out here tryin' to do da right thing 
 And even though you know I don't mind fightin' 
 All I want is cash, money like lightning 
 You know I... Gota get that dough! 
 I ain't rampin' 
 Gotta get that dough! 
 Damm right 
 Gota get that dough! 
 I ain't rampin' 
 Gota get that dough! 
 Straight up! (uha) 
 Taste, charisma stylee we got plenty 
 Cruisin' in the Punto on the way to Bentley 
 Evidently far from gently eatin' up da road 
 We act immaturely in a hurry to be old 
 Infact we'll leave you poorly catch a beatin' like a cold 
 Go ahead profile and flex like you're big, bad and bold 
 Go ahead go round your next to get hit, had and showed 
 Stay out the paper chase 
 Floppy fella's fold 
 Neglect da rules, expect da codes, follow the guide lines 
 Life's been ugly so far but these are fine times 
 I write below the belt above average fine rhymes 
 I always tried to be a star my city saw the signs 
 I try not to be stupid with my fame 
 But constantly I sense fassies bein' clever wiv my name 
 Indirectly call my name like they're callin' my bluff 
 So sadly I often sense the need to get rough. 
 I'm here, there, I'm everywhere 
 I can't be seen, I'm all over 
 Ya nah wat I mean!?! 
 I'm here, there, I'm everywhere 
 I can't be seen, It's all over 
 Ya nah wat I mean!?! 
 I'm here, there, I'm everywhere 
 I can't be seen, I'm all over 
 Ya nah wat I mean!?! 
 I'm here, there, I'm everywhere 
 I can't be seen, so move over 
 Ya nah wat I mean!?! 
 Fulla strife, that's life 
 Deal wiv how bad it is 
 Reminisce, reflect, revise on how bad it coulda been 
 Abuse time and find out how mad it is 
 Time waits for nobody handle your biz 
 Extortionists would love to man-handle this 
 I'm ignorant, refuse to understand what extortion is 
 Jack me and get what? Jack me and get where? 
 Get zilch times zero, times nofin' plus air! 
 Yeah I'm way beyond care 
 Hate me or love me try not to stare 
 Your thoughts and your opinions try not to share 
 I show interest on an occasion that is rare 
 Plus I ain't in the hype, I'm above it and I cause it 
 Can't put a stop to da track but I can pause it 
 So play your role 
 Act tuff put on your show 
 I'll let da ratchet be your audience 
 Bullets will applaud it! 
 I'm here, there, I'm everywhere 
 I can't be seen, I'm all over 
 Ya nah wat I mean!?! 
 I'm here, there, I'm everywhere 
 I can't be seen, It's all over 
 Ya nah wat I mean!?! 
 I'm here, there, I'm everywhere 
 I can't be seen, I'm all over 
 Ya nah wat I mean!?! 
 I'm here, there, I'm everywhere 
 I can't be seen, so move over 
 Ya nah wat I mean!?! 
 My name is Dizzee Dizz 
 I handle my biz 
 My spreaders talkin' gangsta don't know what a gangsta is 
 (Tut) They ain't ready yet, I don't claim a set 
 But if you test I'll leave you wiv something you will regret 
 I'm five ten slim, chocolate skin 
 I'll punch you in your nostrils, I'll punch you in your chin 
 But I ain't mad I'm a lovely lad 
 I'll give you the loveliest beatin' that you've ever had 
 Rude boy, home boy better chill 
 You know I don't watch no face 'cause I'm real 
 I don't care if your sick I don't care if your I'll 
 My foot will add a nice frill to your ice-grill! 
 Son dun-duddy I don't find shit funny 
 If you ever try and go against the flow of my money 
 Word is bun, what's really good I'm really hood 
 Take this song as a caution you really should 
 I'm here, there, I'm everywhere 
 I can't be seen, I'm all over 
 Ya nah wat I mean!?! 
 I'm here, there, I'm everywhere 
 I can't be seen, It's all over 
 Ya nah wat I mean!?! 
 I'm here, there, I'm everywhere 
 I can't be seen, I'm all over 
 Ya nah wat I mean!?! 
 I'm here, there, I'm everywhere 
 I can't be seen, so move over 
 Ya nah wat I mean!?!
