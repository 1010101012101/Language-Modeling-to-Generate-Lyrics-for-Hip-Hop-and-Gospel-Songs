(Intro (Dizzee Rascal talking)) 
 Yo, MC's betta start chattin about wot's really happenin' 
 Because if you ain't chattin about wot's happenin' here 
 Where ya livin' where ya talkin' about? 
 'Cause you know and I know, it's gonna be a hot summer, yo 
 And you know wot (its live-o) it's gonna be an even hotter winter 
 (Its live-o) and I ain't even talkin' about the weather 
 (Dizzee Rass, Roll Deep on these) 
 Dizzee Rascal, uh 
 Looks like I'm loosin friends 
 There's a lot of hostility in my endz 
 We used to argue, always make other new friends 
 Now we settle disagreements with the skenz 
 Looks like I'm loosin mates 
 There's a lot of hostility near my gates 
 We used to fight with kids from other estates 
 Now 8 millimetres settle debates 
 Looks like I'm loosin sight 
 'Cause I'm lookin' at the future, it ain't bright 
 So I look out my window, pray every night 
 I thank God for my friends but they ain't tight 
 Looks like I'm loosin hope 
 'Cause I climbed this mountain without rope 
 But I know I'm the captain of my boat 
 So I steadily sail and hope not to fail 
 But it's a Brand New Day 
 New opportunities, wot can I say 
 I plan to make my pay 
 But put sum away for an offkey day (x2) 
 Demand, collect, cash upfront and direct 
 Pay money, pay respect, don't insult my intellect (x2) 
 When we ain't kids no more 
 Will it still be about wot it is rite now 
 Like fightin for anything, anytime 
 And actin' without a care anywhere 
 When we ain't kids no more 
 Will it still be about wot is rite now 
 Like bankscams, street robbery 
 Shotters, plotters or HMP 
 When we ain't kids no more 
 Will it still be about wot it is rite now 
 Pregnant girls who think they love 
 Useless man's with no plans 
 When we ain't kids no more 
 Will it still be about wot it is rite now 
 'Cause negative signs just keep showin up 
 Some of us betta just start growin' up 
 When I look at my life I can't help but think 
 'Cause I could hav resorted to drugs and drink 
 Everyday was the same as the day before 
 We were never quite sure of wot's in store 
 Everyday I wake up I can't help but feel 
 I'm certain of life, I mean this is real 
 Mouthfuls skippin round my head like dancers 
 I know its wrong to question, but I need answers 
 The who's, the wot's, the how's, the when's, the why's 
 You can look in my face, you see the pain in my eyes 
 Tears ready to fall like the rain in the skies 
 But I hope that I put my feet down and rise 
 'Cause guys wanna test my words 
 So I can't jus cater for second and third 
 Plus I know predators only go for the weak 
 And that's long so I gotta stay strong 
 Get me? 
 (Outro (Dizzee Rascal talking)) 
 (Uh, get me) it's real like that 
 (We're not fuckin' about) yo 
 You know we're goin' on dirty, goin' on stank 
 Summer's gonna be real man 
 (Dizzee Rascal lookin' tank) 
 And winter's gonna be realer 
 Betta start wakin' up (move, move) 
 (Get me, uh, nothin' ain't sweet, nothin' ain't sweet) 
 It's live-o, it's live-o (bip up my bredrin Wiley) 
 (Ha-ha it's all love) Roll, uh, Deep 
 (I'm out of here now, let me go for a walk) 
 Dizzee Rass, we're comin' out, (comin' out, comin' out, comin' out) 
 New stylee I'm finished, next one, next one 
 (Bring the next one)
