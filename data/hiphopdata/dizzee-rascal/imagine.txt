Imagine if I showed you one day I was leavin' da hood, 
 Would you call me a sell out, would you say it's all good? 
 Would you follow if you could? 
 Or would you jus' tell me get da hell out? 
 And imagine if I showed you that I'd found another way 
 Of gettin' dough without doin' dirt, let's blurt 
 Would you love me for givin' you some hope? 
 Or resent me 'cause your pride got hurt? 
 Imagine if we never grew up on a council estate 
 And was country manor raised, with a spoon in our mouth 
 Would we still be makin' fuss about da east an' da south? 
 Would we shiver at da robberies, murder an' da crack? 
 And thank God that we didn't have to live like that 
 Jus' an image on da TV as were comfortably sat sippin' wine 
 Room lit by da summer sunshine, 
 Not a worry in da world as we cash while we chat 
 Oblivious to how we would be livin' on da flipside 
 No experience, not a clude about a rough ride 
 No harassment, no boy dem on our back side 
 That'd be amazin' still! 
 But I know you wonder would it make you any less real? 
 What's da current spot your standin' in offerin'? 
 If you had a better offer, would you go for da kill? 
 Snap out of your daydream, how do you feel? 
 Does it all seem worthwhile for ya? 
 Try an' put it in perspective 
 Retrospective of your profile and your honour, 
 Do you wanna hang about or are you a goner? 
 Come along, think fast, decision time 
 You've been livin' in da grime, don't you wanna climb? 
 Da ladder of life, da wall of enlightenment 
 Or are you looking for da hype an' excitement 
 'Cause there's so much drama in da LDN 
 It's kinda hard tryin' to find legal money to spend 
 Generation genocide look possible 
 Da rate at which we drew up for da sken 
 An' pretend that we don't know who da real enemy is, 
 Who should we hold responsible, instead we offend 
 A couple square metres of pavement in da endz, 
 What would we achieve, my friends?
