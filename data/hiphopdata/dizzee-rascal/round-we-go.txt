Ah 
 It's not a love ting 
 I will love you love you love 
 Ain't no love ting here 
 It's just one big cycle here 
 Yo, ain't no friendship here 
 It's just one big cycle here 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 If you love me, let me know 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 If you love me, let me know 
 Dizzee Rascal yo 
 She used to love him, he used to love her 
 She used to kiss him, he used to hug her 
 Call it deep love or puppy love, they bunked off school 
 Now there's no flame, things not the same 
 Looks like she changed, thinks this is some game 
 He's left in the rain, tryin' to lay blame, took for a fool 
 She moved on quick, he's still love sick 
 She's not having it, thinks he's some prick 
 He don't believe it, wants it just the way it was in school 
 He keeps callin' night and mornin', 
 Break of evenin', break of dawnin' 
 He keeps ringin' up, she keeps hangin' up, oh what a fool 
 She is the best friend and the ex-girlfriend of her old school friend 
 Who is the close friend of this best friend 
 Best friend likes this boy called Blue 
 Best friend loves him, best friend needs him 
 But the ex-girlfriend of the old school friend 
 Who is the close friend of his best friend likes him too 
 So the ex-girlfriend of the old school friend 
 Who is the close friend of his best friend 
 Sits with best friend who by now has slept with Blue 
 Now the ex-girlfriend don't want to pretend that 
 She ain't slept with that boy Blue 
 'Cause he was a friend of her ex-man too, listen 
 Ain't no love ting here 
 It's just one big cycle here 
 Yo, ain't no friendship here 
 It's just one big cycle here 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go

 I'll wreck any girl, check any girl, like expect any girl 
 Rarely reject any girl, sex any girl, I'll just select any girl 
 Black girl, white girl, mixed race girl 
 Bigged bum, big tits, pretty face girl 
 Mauritius, Asian, Chinese girl 
 Keep it I do kiss but don't tell, yo 
 We do big pimpin', late night daylight, big pimpin' 
 Why you laughing that you're bra I'm blinkin' 
 That's a quick juicin', it's no love ting 
 Just bend her over and I leave her limpin' 
 No lips in that, that's not interestin' 
 No cuddling 'cause I'm not caring 
 And no talkin' just straight to the thing 'cause 
 Ain't no love ting here 
 It's just one big cycle here 
 Yo, ain't no friendship here 
 It's just one big cycle here 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 If you love me, let me know 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 If you love me, let me know 
 What's all this love ting talk? 
 Holdin' hands everywhere that you walk? 
 She turned you both out and now you lick toes 
 And she's not faithful, everybody knows 
 She keeps sayin' that she loves you 
 What made you think that was true? 
 Just let her beggers walk through 
 I guarantee that'll be the end of you 
 Look, shall we say that that girl's the boom ting man 
 But she's trouble, she'll make your head spin man 
 Slow down back off the love ting man 
 You don't wanna be left hurtin' man 
 Cut the sweet talk, it ain't workin' man 
 And move on, she's already deserted man 
 You ain't the first, you won't be her last man 
 You feel worse, you're goin' too fast man 
 Ain't no love ting here 
 It's just one big cycle here 
 Yo, ain't no friendship here 
 It's just one big cycle here 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 If you love me, let me know 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 'Round, 'round, 'round we go 
 If you love me, let me know
