Oi 
 Dizzee Rascal and Billy Squier: 
 Ah ha ha 
 Ah ha ha ha 
 (Woo) 
 Yeah 
 Stupid 
 Fix up, look sharp 
 Don't make me bring the blitz out and get dark 
 Hear the bang, see the spark 
 Duck down, lay down, just (get on down) 
 Fix up, look sharp 
 Don't make me bring the blitz out and get dark 
 Hear the bang, see the spark 
 Duck down, lay down, just (get on down) 
 Billy Squier and Dizzee Rascal: 
 I got the big beat (Ah aha) 
 I hear the sound (Yeah) 
 I got the big beat (Dizzee Rascal) 
 I get on down (Rollin' deep) 
 Dizzee Rascal: 
 I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer 
 They're trying to see if Dizzee stays true to his grammar 
 Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me 
 Fuck the glitz and glamor 
 Hit 'em with the Blitz and Hammer 
 Because they're talking bout rushing 
 Talk behind my back but to my face they say nothing 
 Stand up in the dance, keep a firm steady stance 
 Keep the beanies touching, keep the beanies hot flushing 
 Flushing MC's down the loo 
 If you don't believe me bring your posse, bring your crew 
 Feel free to hate 'cause I ain't tryna be your mate 
 Be serious, you wouldn't last an hour in my shoe 
 It's an Air Force One 
 Trainers by the truck load, trainers by the ton 
 Don't be dazed when I catch you by your J's 
 Chump, best to act like Forest Gump, best to run 
 Fix up, look sharp 
 Don't make me bring the blitz out and get dark 
 Hear the bang, see the spark 
 Duck down, lay down, just (get on down) 
 Fix up, look sharp 
 Don't make me bring the blitz out and get dark 
 Hear the bang, see the spark 
 Duck down, lay down, just (get on down) 
 Billy Squier and Dizzee Rascal: 
 I got the big beat 
 I hear the sound 
 I got the big beat (Oi sweet as a nut mate sweet as a nut) 
 I get on down (Oi England) 
 Dizzee Rascal: 
 I stay sweet as a nut, sweet like Tropicana 
 When the hammer hits, your head splits like banana 
 You're not ready for this boy 
 You better send your best soldiers, this is Captain Roscoe 
 More destructive and troublesome than ever 
 I'll probably be doing this, probably forever 
 Fellas wanna stop me they'll probably come together 
 It's probable they'll stop me, probably never 
 Yo topboy, topman, or top a topper 
 Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper 
 I'm old school like Happy Shopper 
 I fight old school, bring your bat and your chopper 
 And a First Aid kit and some antiseptic, this could get hectic 
 I'm a don accept it, you gotta bright future 
 Don't let my gun affect it 
 Dizzee Rascal and Billy Squier: 
 Fix up, look sharp 
 Don't make me bring the blitz out and get dark 
 Hear the bang, see the spark 
 Duck down, lay down, just (get on down) 
 Fix up, look sharp 
 Don't make me bring the blitz out and get dark 
 Hear the bang, see the spark 
 Duck down, lay down, just (get on down) 
 (Woo 
 Get on down) 
 Fix up 
 (Woo)
