My hat is low, my trousers too 
 And people say that I'm too rude 
 But I don't care 'cause I'm the shit 
 So you can all just suck my dick 
 Just suck my 
 When I was a kid I had a chip up on my shoulder 
 It ain't getting better, even though I'm getting older 
 People get offended by the way I talk so freely 
 Pushing up their face and acting funny when they see me 
 But I'm raggo, damn it, so I say fuck it 
 If you don't like the way I do my thing, then you can suck it 
 I really don't give a shit, I really don't care for your approval 
 I'm a fucking G, I'll carry on doing my shit as usual 
 Cause 
 My hat is low, my trousers too 
 And people say that I'm too rude 
 But I don't care 'cause I'm the shit 
 So you can all just suck my dick 
 Just suck my 
 You know I mean, man? 
 I'm just trying to be me, man 
 I'm just trying to be free, man 
 Whagwan man, let me be, man 
 What's the problem? 
 Ya get me? 
 I don't apologize for nothing 
 I try to act right, I try to be polite 
 But I can't take no shite, you best believe I might 
 Just punch you in your moosh, I war like Georgy Bush 
 No need to keep it stush, it's best if you just shush 
 And stay out of my way 'cause I don't wanna play 
 Sorry, what did you say? All right whatever, mate 
 I don't give a shit who likes it, I don't give a shit who don't 
 Don't tell me to change my fucking attitude because I won't 
 My hat is low, my trousers too 
 And people say that I'm too rude 
 But I don't care 'cause I'm the shit 
 So you can all just suck my dick 
 Just suck my 
 Bingo, I got the lingo 
 Come through your window 
 Starr like Ringo 
 Beef, chat bout? 
 I'm involved 
 Keep near danger like Penfold 
 Dylan, Lincoln estate, man 
 Yeah I'm straight, man 
 Everything's great, man 
 Talk low it, can't shake, man 
 Why bother, wait, man 
 Come and take man, waisman 
 Come and get me 
 Killers respect me 
 You can't sweat me 
 I'm the One like Jet Li 
 So come check me 
 Who wanna wet me? 
 Fuck that! Suck someone 
 On a dumb one 
 I'll touch someone 
 Try and test Raskit, what a bumbum 
 Rudeboy, I don't care about no one 
 My hat is low, my trousers too 
 And people say that I'm too rude 
 But I don't care 'cause I'm the shit 
 So you can all just suck my dick 
 Just suck my
