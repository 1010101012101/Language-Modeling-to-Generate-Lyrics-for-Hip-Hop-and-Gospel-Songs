This journey starts 6 years ago 
 In run-down housin estate in Bow 
 East london south-east uk was a young man lets call this young man ray 
 Frustated wiv bein around the way 
 Would say "I'm bored" until one day 
 Gathered up sum change and in exchange got turntables off tony 
 Not only, were they whack, they were wooden, but he took 'em 
 'Cause it was a bargain and it was a good'en 
 And he said to himself who wouldn't? 
 Why not, then he took a little trot to DJ targets squat 
 Stood outside o'the door and knocked 
 Asked what jungle records you got? 
 Must be sumthin you wanna get shot, of, blot 
 Dint buy beats he ready to quit gave 'im the whole lot 
 Then ray had little click, they were hot, young gun soldiers but it all flopped, 
 Still it didn't make ray wanna give up the fight 
 Ray jus picked up the mic, would write, lyrics while excluded 
 No gifts and glamour included 
 Like crime for money, dough, crime pays didn't ya know? 
 Even though ray come across slow 
 Broke shit down, brung another new flow 
 Made beats in the back room 
 Teacher gave him a little spare time 
 Then they got a little bit o'radio airtime 
 1am till 3 be in school by 9 
 This was clearly a positive sign 
 Learnin bout beats breaks and bars 
 Didn't chat about champagne and cars 
 More concerned wiv you know, the grime 
 Made it a touch difficult to shine 
 Among these so-called underground stars 
 Some resented him thus presentin him with pure dumbness like retards 
 It dint matter ray would say, ok, I'm gonna be a real star one day 
 Went through dramas along the way 
 But he stood firm pressed on wiv the wordplay 
 Went through dramas along the way 
 But he stoof firm pressed on wiv the wordplay 
 Went through dramas along the way 
 Lets take a look at ray today...
