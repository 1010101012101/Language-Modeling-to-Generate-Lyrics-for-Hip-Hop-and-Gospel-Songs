There's some girls in the house 
 When you see 'em point 'em out (x4) 
 Got a little thing for pretty little browies 
 Pretty little brown things, all about my timin' 
 London city I'm houndin', catch 'em browning 
 Get the pussy thorough poundin' 
 So I got these star techniques outstanding 
 Did it in a council flat on the landing 
 I'm not rappin', leave 'em puffin' and pantin' 
 On a one night stand thing 
 Just like Shauna, she didn't give me no drama 
 After the show, she was on my banana 
 After my seeds like a farmer 
 Let 'em all out in her mouth, I'm a charmer 
 Couldn't care less about karma 
 Or Carmen 
 Got her titties out in the bottom of my garden 
 I'm a bad boy, I don't beg no pardon 
 Pick 'em up, then I discard 'em 
 I get freaky, freaky, freaky 
 And I get nasty, nasty, nasty 
 Do anything that you want me to 
 Just ask me, ask me, ask me (x2) 
 I had this pretty little girl in Sweden, 
 Yeah, she was kind of short, but she was easy 
 And I like that kind of girl 
 You didn't even need to ask her name 
 Could you believe it? 
 She was suckin' my dick, you should have seen it 
 Got up and tried to kiss me between it, allowed it 
 Could you hear my joy, my disappointment 
 Sprayed in her mouth then watched her kiss her boyfriend 
 Yo, ask Angie 'cause she familiar 
 Got out my dick at the back of the cinema 
 Jamie Foxx, you know "The Kingdom" one, 
 She dealt with my dick till my kingdom come 
 I'm a movie star, I'm quite unique on the camera 
 Weren't quite like Green St., but I hammered her 
 I'm a player and a manager 
 Got a whole lot of game and a lot of stamina (ha!) 
 I get freaky, freaky, freaky 
 And I get nasty, nasty, nasty 
 Do anything that you want me to 
 Just ask me, ask me, ask me (x2) 
 I'm so barmey, been a bad boy since (unclear) 
 I know a couple white girls, outside Yardley 
 Keep a couple light skinned things like Harvey 
 Plus Barbie, that's my blonde thing 
 She give me brain in the car, no long thing 
 She ain't scared, she's on this thing 
 And she's always up for a bonkin' 
 Yeah my love life looks like Flava Flav's 
 I got girls for days, 
 I got dark skinned, pink, yellow, brown, and beige 
 Come like a rainbow on a rainy day, non-discriminant 
 Long and strong and the sex is brilliant 
 Please make sure the poon-tang's Brazilian 
 Won't stop till I can't cum, like William 
 So I keep drillin' 'em, 
 Thanks a million 
 I get freaky, freaky, freaky 
 And I get nasty, nasty, nasty 
 Do anything that you want me to 
 Just ask me, ask me, ask me (x2) 
 Antoinette, Angelina, Alisha, 
 Corrina, Katherina, Keisha, 
 Kaykyro, Tina, Tylisha 
 Faith, Fiona, Felicia 
 Denise, Patrice, Shanice, Cherice, 
 Dominique, Natalie, and Nisha 
 Naomi, Nicola, Niree 
 I won't let any trump thing get by me 
 Jenna, Jolene, and Josie 
 Believe I'm lookin' at Jennifer closely 
 Kaylee, Clair, it's hot in here 
 But I ain't lookin' for (unclear) mostly 
 Eighteen to twenty-one, 
 Anyone under the the don't fit the bill 
 But to all my independent ladies, bring that pussy at will 
 I get freaky, freaky, freaky 
 And I get nasty, nasty, nasty 
 Do anything that you want me to 
 Just ask me, ask me, ask me (x2)
