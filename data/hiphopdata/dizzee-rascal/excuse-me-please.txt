Sometimes T think the whole world's gone crazy 
 The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me 
 I get baffled every time I try suss it 
 And now I've had a lot 
 So excuse me please, fuck it 
 Can somebody tell me what this world's about 
 Can somebody tell me what this life's about 
 I just can't work it out 
 No sense, no logic 
 I can't get a grip of it 
 I do my best to understand it 
 But I've never got it 
 I watch the people stuck it out 
 The struggle in the system 
 But the errors are the same, whether a muslim or a Christian 
 There so much hate in the world 
 We're fighting, what are we fighting for 
 When the rich kid getting richer 
 And the poor keep getting ignored 
 Lord... 
 Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy 
 The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me 
 I get baffled every time I try suss it 
 And now I've had a lot 
 So excuse me please, fuck it 
 I took it there it there 
 And now its time to take it further 
 If a policeman kill someone 
 Is that policeman still a murderer 
 He's got a worthy cause, I guess 
 That gives him some immunnity 
 Or is he just another lost soul in the community 
 To take a life's a serious thing 
 And only god can judge it 
 Would he look at it, like its for the safety of the public 
 And if you don't wanna pay the price 
 You really shouldn't fuck it 
 I know I'm playing with fire 
 But fuck it I love it 
 'Cause... 
 Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy 
 The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me 
 I get baffled every time I try suss it 
 And now I've had a lot 
 So excuse me please, fuck it
