Dizzee: Who's that who's that who's that? 
 Girl: The dopest, flyest OG pimp hustler, gangster player hardcore motherfucker living today. 
 To be honest I'm totally and completely on his dick. 
 And you know this man! 
 It's the return of Dizzee Rascal 
 Dem bwoi nah ready yet trend dat you never set. 
 Silence silence silence dat. stop that start that get that. Yeah you know, 
 Going on dirty going on stank. Yo 
 Roll deep with these, put these MC's on deep freeze, 
 Hit these Whitney's and rip these, Come like Busta we flip these, So Please 
 Don't rap with these, fearless, angry, sick MC's 
 Don't like Christine's or Britney's, Lala's or Tinky Winky's 
 And this one strictly for pick these? Old school afro dry white beats 
 Barclays Halifax we stick these, Endless gunshots we lick these 
 Trick these CID's with ease, touch mic MC's jump like fleas 
 Playa haters get chopped like trees, a boy rascal to a boy in histories 
 It seems to be cars, (and) cash (and) girls (and) heads, 
 And manners on the flames better keep your eye out for them feds 
 It seems to be phones (and) bling (and) raves (and) weed (and) 
 Pay up what you owe or else them boys will make you bleed 
 It seems to be DJ's, (and) MC's, (and) Gold rings, (and) Nikes 
 We roll deep for the money we don't want no technicalities 
 It seems to be love (and) war (and) hate (and) life 
 Harsh life, hustle life, thug life, street life! 
 So far from clean, play kiss chase with your aunt Maureen 
 Get rhymes get heard get seen Dizzee run tings like Idi Armin 
 Keep vigilant keep on guard, we chuck grenades at Scotland Yard 
 Retard get kicked out real hard, leave death threats in your birthday card.

 Ding dong, its on, fake MC's wanna sing my song 
 Wanna test hurry up bring it on; wanna take me for a mong? (Nar that's wrong) 
 Hit 'em with the Jeet Kun Do, like key low blow leave bullet holes in the moschinos clothes 
 Hot like where the weed grows, carry condoms for the hoes 
 Back front inside out, Dizzee got the floor to make a boy white out 
 Six foot deep you could never climb out, I smoke the weed till my mum finds out 
 Front back outside in, bare-foot kids living on ging-seng 
 Love makin' nah doggy-styling, in a dark park where the dark come in.
