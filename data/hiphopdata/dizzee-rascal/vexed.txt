I'm showin you my life more deep than you think 
 At nites I get a little less sleep than you think 
 Somethin' keeps me up I can't even get a wink 
 And there's no point in tryin' so I lay there 'n' blink 
 I'm showin u I feel more stress than you see 
 But my business is my business and I keep it all to me 
 I've done a lot of work for you to see me where I be 
 But lately I sense you don't wanna set me free 
 And lately there's been controversy around my name 
 But fuck you 'cause I ain't playin' ur game 
 My attitude my language they ain't used to it 
 But I ain't uk garage so get used to it 
 'Cause I was raised an only child 
 Not a brother not a sis 
 Raised around hate 
 Not a hug not a kiss 
 Before this I was jus a failure in the mist 
 And I made it through the fog I can't let you take the piss 
 I don't wana get vexed n I don't wana lose my cool 
 But I ain't gona let that boy come round try 'n' take me for no fool 
 I ain't gona let that boy come round I'm reachin' for my tool 
 I ain't gona let that boy get flash I'll smash his head on the wall 
 I don't wana get vexed and I don't wana lose my rag 
 But I ain't gona let that boy come round try 'n' take me for no slag 
 I ain't gona let that boy come round runnin' his gums ur mad 
 Can't be havin' him think I'm fake I'll make his family sad 
 I do the fuck wot I want that's how I got here 
 And I'll be damned if I let you fussys interfere 
 And if I had my way you won't even get near 
 I don't need ur help do I make myself clear 
 I know it sounds rude that's because its meant to be 
 I try to be the rudest boy in this industry 
 Ain't 2 faced and I ain't one to blow 
 If I don't like you then I'll tell you to ur ?? 
 I don't know wot you want I don't know wot you expect 
 But if I don't know you don't ask me for respect 
 I don't give it easily I don't give it much 
 And I ain't got a heart so don't eva try 'n' talk 
 All these peeps runnin' round like owe them 
 But before I got big I didn't even know them 
 I'll be doin' this for a whole lotta years 
 And I'll be standin straight when the smoke clears 
 I don't wana get vexed n I don't wana lose my cool 
 But I ain't gona let that boy come round try 'n' take me for no fool 
 I ain't gona let that boy come round I'm reachin' for my tool 
 I ain't gona let that boy get flash I'll smash his head on the wall 
 I don't wana get vexed and I don't wana lose my rag 
 But I ain't gona let that boy come round try 'n' take me for no slag 
 I ain't gona let that boy come round runnin' his gums ur mad 
 Can't be havin' him think I'm fake I'll make his family sad 
 I'm the type of boy that takes the bump wiv the grind 
 I'm the type of boy to take ur girl from behind 
 I'm the type of boy ur girl wants me to be, she told me 
 I don't act the prettiest 'cause it don't suit me 
 U could hurry up and you could even shoot me 
 But if ur girls lettin off then it's my duty 
 I ain't tryina keep ur wifey truthly 
 But it ain't my fault ur girlfriends a groupie 
 Be careful wot you ask for you could change ur mind 
 And wot you lookin' for you won't like wot you find 
 If you lookin' for the gossip if ur lookin' for the chat 
 I'll remind you that curiousity killed the cat 
 Plus ur tellin' lies 'n' they spreadin like the plague 
 What else can I do except keep myself made 
 I don't know why these girls are tryin' to attack me 
 But I'm a rude boy I won't let nobody track me 
 I don't wana get vexed n I don't wana lose my cool 
 But I ain't gona let that boy come round try 'n' take me for no fool 
 I ain't gona let that boy come round I'm reachin' for my tool 
 I ain't gona let that boy get flash I'll smash his head on the wall 
 I don't wana get vexed and I don't wana lose my rag 
 But I ain't gona let that boy come round try 'n' take me for no slag 
 I ain't gona let that boy come round runnin' his gums ur mad 
 Can't be havin' him think I'm fake I'll make his family sad
