I love you 
 I, I, I, I, I, I love you 
 I love, I love, I love, I love you 
 I, I, I, I, I, I love you 
 I, I, I, I, I, I love you 
 I love, I, I, I, I love you 
 I, I, I, I, I love you 
 I, I, I, I, I, I love you 
 I, I love you, I love you 
 I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I love you, you, you 
 I love, love, love, love you, you, you 
 Yo, if that girl knows where you stay that's poor 
 Some whore banging on your door what for 
 Pregnant? What are you talking about, be sure 
 Fifteen, she's underage, that's raw 
 And against law, five years or more 
 And she wants a score and half of a draw 
 That's the kind of threat that you can't ignore 
 That whore got you pinned down to the floor 
 But it's your own fault, you said three magic words 
 "I love you," when that's the one for the birds 
 When you said that she forgot other boys 
 It's over, you better start buying the toys 
 There was no intention of her being wife 
 Now she knows this, she's ending your life 
 It's a real shame you got had by the whores 
 It's a shame that kid probably ain't yours 
 That girl some bitch you know 
 She keep callin' my phone, she don't leave me alone 
 She just moan and groan, she just keep ringin' me at home 
 These days I don't answer my phone 
 Shystie: 
 That boy some prick you know 
 All up in my hair, thinks that I care 
 Keeps followin' me here, keeps followin' me there 
 These days I can't go nowhere 
 Dizzee Rascal and Shystie: 
 (Ain't that your girl?) Nah it ain't my girl 
 (I swear that's your girl) Course it ain't my girl 
 (She got juiced up) Oh well 
 (She got chatted up) Oh well 
 I swear that's your man (I ain't got no man) 
 But you was with that man (He was just any man) 
 He got hotted up (Oh well) 
 He got whacked up (Oh well) 
 Dizzee Rascal: 
 Alright, she's a bad girl, I'm a boss though 
 Captain Roscoe with a crossbow 
 She came she got picked off, yo 
 Nah, it's not a love ting, get lost hoe 
 Dizzee Rascal come down like snow 
 With freezing cold flows like Moscow, yo 
 Dumb hoe, get me upset, guns blow 
 Bitch, you're not ready for skid row 
 Bleed know Dizzee Rascal did grow 
 Big feet for the force on my big toe 
 I got no chaps, no chains, not much dough 
 Get juiced but you don't get love though 
 No slap but you might get a co-co, yo 
 Jambo coming through like Rambo 
 Love ting takes two like tango 
 But she ain't my wifey, she can go 
 That girl some bitch you know 
 She keep callin' my phone, she don't leave me alone 
 She just moan and groan, she just keep ringin' me at home 
 These days I don't answer my phone 
 Shystie: 
 That boy some prick you know 
 All up in my hair, thinks that I care 
 Keeps followin' me here, keeps followin' me there

 (I swear that's your girl) Course it ain't my girl 
 (She got juiced up) Oh well 
 (She got chatted up) Oh well 
 I swear that's your man (I ain't got no man) 
 But you was with that man (He was just any man) 
 He got hotted up (Oh well) 
 He got whacked up (Oh well) 
 Dizzee Rascal: 
 Listen, I like your girl so you better look after your girl 
 Or I might just take your girl and make your girl my girl 
 Switch your girl with Michelle, switch Michelle with Chantelle 
 Play Chantelle with Shanell, lyrical clientele 
 But I ain't a bow cat, I don't like the smell 
 I'm a ghost in the shell when I make a boy feel unwell 
 That girl's from school, that girl's from college 
 That girl gives brains, that girl gives knowledge 
 That girl gives head, that girl gives shines 
 That girl gives BJ's at all times 
 She looks decent, she looks fine 
 But don't talk about wifey, she's not mine 
 She got batches, six in a line 
 Believe that's not a good sign 
 That girl some bitch you know 
 She keep callin' my phone, she don't leave me alone 
 She just moan and groan, she just keep ringin' me at home 
 These days I don't answer my phone 
 Shystie: 
 That boy some prick you know

 But you was with that man (He was just any man) 
 He got hotted up (Oh well) 
 He got whacked up (Oh well) 
 Dizzee Rascal: 
 Uh, Dizzee Rascal 
 Roll Deep, it's all love, haha 
 2000 and slew, get me 
 Damn right I'm articulate, I'm not an idiot 
 Dem boy no ready yet, trend they could never set 
 This is the next step, I ride the two-step 
 Niggas better get set, I'll make your girl wet 
 Damn right I'm articulate, I'm not an idiot 
 Dem boy no ready yet, trend they could never set 
 This is the next step, I ride the two-step 
 Niggas better get set, I'll make your girl wet 
 (I love you, you, you, you)
