We're the warriors 
 And we're on different floors 
 And different corridors 
 (Corridors, corridors) 
 'Cause we're the warriors 
 Those conquistadors 
 'Cause we are warriors 
 (Warriors, warriors) 
 Beautiful people, we come to you 
 Humble as doves, many men can enter 
 The covenant, the love from up above 
 Beautiful skies, so those eyes realize 
 Get it? Those eyes? 
 Like that I, me been on the rise 
 Thou not commit adultery 
 I can feel it when they come up 
 Feel it when they run up 
 The shit still hurts, none will be worthy 
 Praise but Allah, Bizzy Bone 
 I'm his slave, the brave of the squad 
 The braids? Let me cut them off 
 Ru, don't worry, I'll be back in a hurry 
 Braille for Allah 
 Every time the Suleiman come 
 I'm on the run till they run up 
 They ain't finna do nothin' to us 
 Right on detail, not on my watch 
 Not on my swatch, not on my block 
 We're the warriors 
 And we're on different floors 
 And different corridors 
 (Corridors, corridors) 
 'Cause we're the warriors 
 Those conquistadors 
 'Cause we are warriors 
 (Warriors, warriors) 
 We're the warriors 
 And we're on different floors 
 And different corridors 
 (Corridors, corridors) 
 'Cause we're the warriors 
 Those conquistadors 
 'Cause we are warriors 
 (Warriors, warriors) 
 I'ma walk till the end through the sin 
 On the fight for the righteous 
 My warrior's plight is priceless, never betray 
 Till the day we're formed in his likeness 
 Earnin' my strips, facin' the wolf 
 For the lord's my light, ways through the maze 
 And snakes in the night, so that we might 
 Just get it right and make it to the father with Christ 
 All my life, I been a soldier, mobbin' and questionin' 
 Till the test is over, now that we know 
 We can fo'sho dodge Satan and shape up 
 The dust and post up to the dojia 
 Sure 'nough got to keep composure 
 In the face of adversity, turnin' me off of my journey 
 I think I'ma go nuts and fuck it 
 If it ain't the pulpit, no time for the bullshit 
 Nigga, we soldiers of God, willin' to trade in 
 My life to serve you even through poverty 
 Truly an honor, don't get me wrong 
 Know that it's on 
 Comin' for what they owe and the throne 
 Tellin' the father the codes fo'sho 
 And it won't be long, stay strong, my nigga 
 We warriors 
 We're the warriors 
 And we're on different floors 
 And different corridors 
 (Corridors, corridors) 
 'Cause we're the warriors 
 Those conquistadors 
 'Cause we are warriors 
 (Warriors, warriors) 
 We're the warriors 
 And we're on different floors 
 And different corridors 
 (Corridors, corridors) 
 'Cause we're the warriors 
 Those conquistadors 
 'Cause we are warriors 
 (Warriors, warriors) 
 Praise Allah, Suleiman roll out 
 Before you get rolled over and pummeled 
 Popped in the stomach, in the belly of a mother 
 Better believe god run it, Hume 
 That's for the beloved 
 While we drummin' and comin' 
 We talkin' much, baby, better must stay 
 In touch and up 
 (Up) 
 To the heavenly skies 
 Allah, the creator, ain't none greater 
 Uh, watch these haters, watch them brainwaves 
 Soundin' like flares, beware when they come 
 In the door, just a Sector Pod, who ain't mob? 
 Allah is god, feel that, Job? Feel that, Job? 
 Humble abode, watch that green 
 Deep in the scenes, deep in the genes 
 I'm deep by any means, whatever, whatever 
 We're the warriors 
 And we're on different floors 
 And different corridors 
 (Corridors, corridors) 
 'Cause we're the warriors 
 Those conquistadors 
 'Cause we are warriors 
 (Warriors, warriors) 
 We're the warriors 
 And we're on different floors 
 And different corridors 
 (Corridors, corridors) 
 'Cause we're the warriors 
 Those conquistadors 
 'Cause we are warriors 
 (Warriors, warriors)
