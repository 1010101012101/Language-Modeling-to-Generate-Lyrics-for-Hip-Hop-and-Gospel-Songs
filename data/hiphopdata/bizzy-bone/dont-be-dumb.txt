Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss, 
 And this is... 
 Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss, 
 And this is... 
 Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss, 
 And this is... 
 Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss,

 See, I went down and dirty and she liked the sucky sucky 
 And liked it all in her tummy, and started askin for money 
 It was over 
 Off to another one, never leave my house without packin a gun 
 Jumped in the Benzino, while Nikki was in L.A. smokin' primo 
 She said no one could make her cum, till she came met Gambino 
 I ain't need no introduction, I'm that Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone 
 And I don't give a fuck what you got goin' on 
 I left Watts, gold Zenith tootin, while shootin my show 
 Is that cocaine? 
 Boo, you gotta go 
 I miss her though 
 Back on the ho stroll, drinkin' and losin control 
 Got back to Cleveland and hooked back up with Mo Mo 
 Pretty young thugstress, who loved the thug shit 
 And on the lo lo, I like that, even rolled the getaway 
 'Cause I ain't that ordinary thug, go on all about that gun play 
 Soon as she popped up with a baby, drivin' me crazy 
 Watched her push it out, cut the cord, little Christian, love you baby 
 Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss, 
 And this is... 
 Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss, 
 And this is... 
 Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss, 
 And this is...

 So now we havin' sex again, hittin some different levels 
 The babys lookin' Mexican, I look at you like the devil 
 My sisters only using you, 'cause I never abused you 
 So she's doin' it for me, only if you knew, boo 
 And plus, she fucked Layzie, was makin' eyes with Krayzie 
 And old Flesh had her first, but I'm that one that made it work 
 You can kiss my ass, hear my laugh 
 Hear me now and listen later 
 Anyway, I'm still the playa 
 On the real bitch, you hurt me, if that's any consolidation 
 You was just another temptation, on to the next one 
 That's enough of her 
 My belt is just the way I like it 
 Don't bite it and you can get it when you want to 
 You love the way I ate that, your girl hated that 
 But don't be dumb 
 I guess it's too late for that 
 Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss, 
 And this is... 
 Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss, 
 And this is... 
 Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss, 
 And this is...

 I'm cummin! Tellin' me you love little Bizzy, 
 God don't like ugly, and he ain't too fine or pretty, is he? 
 Oh, and I seent you hangin' with sissies, 
 All that sinnin, women with, actin' feminine 
 But you said he a sho' thang, that'll make him a better friend 
 But then again, how could I judge? 
 But they still can't kick it with the thug 
 Check all the glasses, and check the toilet seat for bugs 
 As soon as you passed it, I was high enough 
 I ain't a fascist, 'cause I don't like to kick it with faggots 
 Do yo thang, and I hope that God helps you on your quest for thangs 
 Rain, rain go away, come back another day 
 (Talking) 
 I don't love them hos 
 I don't love them hos 
 And the moral of this story is don't love them hos 
 If you searchin for somethin' 
 You searchin for a woman 
 You searchin for a man 
 But through your search 
 You gonna come through a lot of obstacles 
 A lot of twists, a lot of turns 
 But you gotta be able to taste it to know what's sweet 
 To know what's sour, to know what's good, to know what's bad 
 But fuck all that get back to the chorus 
 Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss, 
 And this is... 
 Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss, 
 And this is... 
 Don't be dumb 
 Ignorance was bliss, and this is something that I won't miss, 
 And this is... 
 Don't be dumb
