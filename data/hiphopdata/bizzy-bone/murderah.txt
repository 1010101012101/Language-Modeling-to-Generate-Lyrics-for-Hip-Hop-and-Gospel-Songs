Murdarah, Murdarah 
 Murdarah, Murdarah 
 Enemies please I keep my chest out believe me 
 700 laywers and they all actin' greedy 
 Money hungry strugglin while thuggin' 
 My baby momma complain I'm full wit pain 
 Cigrettes tha tame enemies filled wit pain 
 Itchy fingers while niggaz they snitched out 
 And bitches inches from havin' pussy poppers wit pistol switches 
 Picture that 
 I actually I'm happy daddy just don't understand 
 I'm back on tha block wit chucks and my man 
 And store my sexuality when all tha chickens where virgins (now) 
 Rebellin in excursions wonderin if it be burnin up suburbans 
 And my community we watch fights and it really don't bother me 
 Sadamized by poverty 
 Cause nobody think 'bout the babies 
 Cause nobody thinkin' 'bout the babies 
 Yeaaaaa! murdarah murdarah 
 Yeaaaaa! murdarah murdarah 
 Heavily in tha drug thang 
 And if they can stop Saddam from sellin missiles 
 How we satuated wit pistols they illegalize 
 And tax which changed and mark my words 
 They doin' tha same thing wit cocaine 
 And herb how we everyday handle well 
 Jesus planted tha seeds and help ease lil boys and girls ease 
 There minds and I ain't talkin' bout smokin' weed 
 Tha word is all you need follow my lead 
 I'm thorough I know wit different homies barrowed through different girls 
 Have double barrow pro hammers 
 And I sold crack to sherrell and blastin 
 Got cleansed to save my selve and no turnin' around cause tha ?????? 
 Cause nobody cause no one's thinkin' 'bout the babies 
 Cause no one's thinkin' 'bout the babies 
 Yeaaaaa! murdarah murdarah 
 Yeaaaaa! murdarah murdarah 
 Here for tha babies and I'm takin' my kids wit me 
 See Moses never made to tha promise land Satan come get me 
 He's ready to burn us all baptize is flames like Kane 
 Takin' tha shot to my body can enemies aim for my brain 
 Pray for tha devil hopin he change his ways he still laughin' 
 Screamin I don't know tha half but tell me wha tha fuck done happen 
 I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing GOD got my back remember that 
 And fuck me 'cause I'm on tha attack 
 Can't waste my time wit these niggaz my brothers are just like me 
 Makin' a form wit tha image but I love to scrimmage wit tha team 
 Believe in Jesus indeed huh 
 Gotta get more deeper concentrate on tha love 
 Satan is gettin' weaker no one's thinkin' 'bout the babies no one's 
 Thinkin' 'bout the babies 
 Yeaaaaa! murdarah murdarah 
 Yeaaaaa! murdarah murdarah 
 Yeaaaaa! murdarah murdarah
