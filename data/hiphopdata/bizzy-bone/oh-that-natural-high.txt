Yeah Capone, we Back at it again, 
 Shoutouts Bone Thugs N Harmony, wassup young Layzie Bone, young Krayzie Bone young Wish Bone, 
 Congratulations Flesh N Bone for finally geting up out of jail I am Bizzy Bone the Kid, young Glory Fend in full affect after the assention 
 Yes indeed no tension, and just remember never forget to mention 
 God first uh, Come on, come on 
 Yeah, I say my preachy flow like cream stackery umbrella 
 Holly water to shower my skeletons and gather my Bones together 
 Let the world wind swirl inside of my vessel, have no association with the devil 
 Nah nigga, heaven is on my level, you never speak to the savior 
 Casting them down quietly, pick me against the irony 
 Television with wings, be gang bangin' the spirit 
 Leave me the fuck alone I've been cool since Jesus feel us 
 Take a breath 'n' breeth it, that's what I do when I'm on that oxygen 
 Take a breath 'n' breeth it, it's just like heaven it puts me on a natural high 
 Take a breath 'n' breeth it, just take a breath 'n' you will touch the sky 
 Take a breath 'n' breeth it, you know that oxygen puts me on a cloud 
 I'm smoother then Omarion, strong soulhjah like Gibson 
 Belly dancin like gypsys carrying on a mission, tipsy upon this oxygen 
 Snortin the toxin given, focusin on the molecules, no focus on vixen 
 Crack money my recipe Kentucky fried chicken 
 Lifted up with wings of Angels with no predictions, I'm posted up like missing dogs 
 Barkin towards expedition, Father Jesus keep on servin' them uh, and I won't listen 
 It's like revalations they took us to the beginning 
 And even if we loose we still winning, watch out cause Judece isn't 
 And time is so forgiving but some of us over did it 
 Goodfellas we hoodfellas you know I'm on this mission, holla back 
 Take a breath 'n' breeth it, that's what I do when I'm on that oxygen 
 Take a breath 'n' breeth it, it's just like heaven it puts me on a natural high 
 Take a breath 'n' breeth it, just take a breath 'n' you will touch the sky 
 Take a breath 'n' breeth it, you know that oxygen puts me on a cloud 
 All lions need a lion 'n' god don't need a thing 
 I sing to the most masterfull, we slaves not kings 
 And I bring fire from the heaven if I could not ming, I'm like a shadow 
 U can lighten me to tend so many beings 
 I said send me 12 thousand, and ruben the same thing, Benjamen get to sayin' 
 We just gon take the shame, slain lambs on credus 
 Like pigs with no breakfast, kids with no destiny 
 Loyal to Christ excellent mathematics and excellence 
 Take a breath 'n' breeth it, that's what I do when I'm on that oxygen 
 Take a breath 'n' breeth it, it's just like heaven it puts me on a natural high 
 Take a breath 'n' breeth it, just take a breath 'n' you will touch the sky 
 Take a breath 'n' breeth it, you know that oxygen puts me on a cloud
