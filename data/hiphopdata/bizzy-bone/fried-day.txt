(Lighter clicking in the background) 
 Now this is what I'm talking about baby (inhaling) 
 And this is for the weed heads and this is for the 
 Weedheads 
 Get a bag of dope in a quarter o 
 (Chorus) (repeat2x) 
 (Second and fourth time at end in background "wanna get 
 High get high") 
 So who want a bag who want a bag 
 You want a bag you want a bag 
 You got a bag so send 'em out the door to the liquer 
 Store 
 Get a bag of dope in a quarter o 
 (First verse) 
 Oh why don't we legalize reefer leaves in time 
 Some of them say weed evil a little sumthin sumthin for 
 My people 
 And though I know that weed will even out your day 
 Love everything green well that's what my sister said god said 
 Gonna get ya fucked up wanna get ya fucked up 
 Will you take one hit that'll make you hush up nigga shut 
 The fuck up 
 No stems no, indo and chronic hydro that stinkin' and I can think of 
 Some more 
 Oh yes time to smoke sesso I know high day come 
 Around on fried day 
 Foreva deep boy yes then we pray 
 As the reefer help me see more everyday 
 Would've it could've it be heaven sent 
 One hell of a superstar ball every first Friday 
 Of the month 
 And your humbily invited were truly humbly united 
 Enemies and all of y'all hate on when I get my 
 Fade on 
 I'm so high 
 (Chorus) (same as first) 
 (Second verse) 
 It'll rule ya smokin' the potent buddha (buddha) 
 They ain't nothin' like that buddha lovin' bomb shit 
 Fat enough that it will make me move ya sooth ya 
 Reefer creeper seepin in my sneakers seepin in my shiva 
 Heave her (nigga) 
 You better believe us even when I'm lonly weed wont 
 Leave us 
 Not like these fake niggas that deceive us 
 All day the weed man bizzy need the chronic when it's 
 Seedless 
 Life ain't easy put it on eazy but we still 
 Breathin 
 Takin' a hit of the reefer sendin me straight to 
 Heaven 
 Chokin with my breezy 
 That herbal healin 
 And don't ya wanna feel that feelin' and don't you wanna 
 Spend your scrilla 
 And givin' the weed to the killas niggas forget why they 
 Killin' (hell ya) 
 I heard they heard they heard they out here fuckin' 
 Wit pills 
 Nigga those chemicals will make you ill so get off 
 The ecstasy 
 So come to the realers mysterious and pass the rush of a box of blunts, 
 A sack of skunk and your endin' up in the coffin (sure 'nuff, sure 'nuff) 
 (Chorus) (same as first) 
 (Verse three) 
 Toke that toke until we love that love that 
 That 
 Don't legalize 'cause they know we can roll 
 Gettin' high just to get by 
 Through all the suicides and homicides 
 And genocides drivebys walkbys gonna multiply 
 And chalk lines in the towns in the h-double-o-d hood 
 And it would rain 
 And it ain't all were it ain't all and it ain't all and 
 It ain't all good 
 I started at eleven stealin weed from coppers kreeper 
 And even though you beat us I gotta thank you for the 
 Reefer 
 Neva mess with white girls but I roll those white 
 Boys 
 Niggas come out the pen and they roll some tight 
 Joints tight joints 
 My shit is swollen you shouldn't be rollin' 
 Livin' on green leaves that will make your heart 
 Bleed for the moment 
 Just go and let me split up the weed and be silent 
 And sober 
 No jokin when the nieghbers door is open you want to 
 Come over 
 We smokin' smokin' and now we tokin tokin and then we chokin 
 Chokin chokin 
 Chokin chokin chokin chokin chokin 
 I'm so high 
 (Chorus) (repeat till end)
