 Bizzy: 
 Nobody believes. Nobody believes. Nobody believes 
 Me, even my baby girl. See I was raised up on that 
 Ouija in my crazy 
 World. Better take it easy. Sang: Outta my mind, 
 Outta my mind, outta my mind, outta my brains, brains. 
 7th Sign time, in a line, 
 Shine, fin to bye-bye, die die, bang bang. Hit 'em 
 With that woo-woo, and that flip-flop flown-n-low. 
 Steady as we roll. Maybe 
 You don't know, oh. Get away for safety, in a 
 Coma-like state, invade me. Everyone say: 'Hey, hey, 
 He's crazy.' Premenitions, 
 Kick pushin' daisies. Wait, they chase to slay me. 
 Paranoid. Mortal to the paranormal. Jumpin' out 
 Portals. Kinetical energy 
 Formal in the global get warmer. Mormons may mourn, 
 May Messiahs be born, torn in the purgatory. Sworn to 
 Violence, silence, 
 Word my bond. Get ya story on, call me, saw me 
 In the army gatherin' in harmony. Hardly in all we be 
 So salty. 
 Bizzy: 
 Demons surround me 
 All the time.

 Bizzy: 
 Talk to the walkin' dead, crossroads, call on the 
 Rev., lost souls. And I'm off in a coffin' tossin' my 
 Memoirs, oh no. In the closet, 
 Come open the door, what do you see? A funeral. 
 Usually closest to kosher till I see some loved ones, 
 Don't go. Get it crucial, 
 Pick up the psychic line, future to before time in 
 The sinister mind of spiritual wicked, intertwined 
 With weak souls, come kick it. 
 Written, rewind, get it, look out, hit it, rise. Dig 
 It, wig out, feel it, ride. Mimic, die. Nigga, fly. 
 Boom bye-bye. My kind in time, 
 7th Sign, 7th Sign (7th Sign). Time after time get 
 Mine, gon' get mine. Pick up the phone line, pick up 
 The phone line, ready for 
 Truth on the loose? Got a dime or two and I'm 
 Liable to tell you, only if you know, woo. He flew 
 Right bye you, true, demons 
 Follow and resume from the womb in the tomb. I fool 
 You, boom, boom, boom. B-b-b-boom, boom, boom, boom, 
 Boom, boom. 
 Bizzy: 
 Demons surround me 
 All the time.
