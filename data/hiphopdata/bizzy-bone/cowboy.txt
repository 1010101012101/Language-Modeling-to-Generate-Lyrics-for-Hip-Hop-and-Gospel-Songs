(Yeah this one right here for my niggas, riding them city streets 
 Getting swallowed in the city lights, 
 For my niggas that still stand on the block 
 Everyday getting they grind on, 
 Can't trust a damn thing now a days, 
 This rap game ain't nothing different.) 
 (You know I'm just a cowboy, and I be out every night on the town now 
 Come around when I'm down girl, (cowgirl), 
 Do you keep me around, and around and around, and around) 
 You know I like to play and fuck and get drunk and smoke drugs 
 With my boys in the club, in the back. fucked up 
 Walk past me lingerie, lingering 
 No respect girl get out the way, Heaven sees me 
 Why do you stay with me, don't play with me, and please tell the truth 
 Do you really even know that I don't even love you 
 I don't really love me, so how could this be you waste your time on a wretch, is the sex that sweet? 
 I'm just a cowboy, hanging out making money daily 
 On the prowl with my new thing, not thinking of your felony 
 Cause really I don't need a woman, I don't need a friend 
 Bend over backwards for a woman, and she'll find another man 
 I see 'em all down the church girl 
 It's just us in the world 
 Baby mama wanna ball so I ball on the curb 
 And still I seen nothing, no love no nothing 
 And nothing brings nothing, so why should I give you something. 
 (I'm married to the money 
 I'm married to the game 
 I'm married to the money 
 Still the same OG) 
 And I don't fight with a bitch, I laugh and just leave 
 Had a broad on the trail, take the sail just believe 
 It was Adam and Eve, and not Adam and Steve 
 It was our path and yes indeed, tell her she's out of my league 
 I don't need to breathe I create, hey bitch 
 You always been a downfall, always been a snitch 
 Keep my drugs at your crib, give you money just to live 
 Fuck it up, smoke it up, now you wonder where I live 
 Never take care of my kids, just lay back in bed 
 With a nasty name and a nasty game, eat shit 
 Ask R.I.P weak bitch, we them county niggas, and we never betray the body we them bounty niggas 
 It's going down my niggas, we got money and one penny 
 Any problem, yes we ride alone zoned out with nitty 
 And anybody asks, we pass and keep bread 
 And a chick just a harlot, we cast her in the bed 
 (I'm married to the money 
 I'm married to the game 
 I'm married to the money 
 Still the same OG) 
 (You know I'm just a cowboy, and I be out every night on the town now
