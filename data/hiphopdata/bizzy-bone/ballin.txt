 (Bizzy Bone:) 
 Motherfuckers ain't gon' get at me like that nigga (laughs) 
 And ready for warfare 
 They ain't ridden me of nothin' but weapons of war playa 
 Pick up the double for reverends and devils 
 More weapons will give 'em the bite there 
 But the war yeah, he got us a sword right out of a drawer 
 Now give me a reason this isn't assault, my fault 
 Caught up in the crosshairs, here's more playa 
 They thought it was over and it was a wrap 
 I tap-dance, for the paper, escape in a world that they never did care playa 
 And when it was written, the devil didn't deliver it in your mail 
 And what do you know, it's just like livin' in hideous times here 
 Addicted to kick it, compete with the price 
 Pour me some ice, yeah, now give me some liquor to get with the vibe 
 For quicker than fast to get with the mass 
 The underclass is what they call it 
 Call me a drunk or an alcoholic I'm ballin, motherfucker! 
 I'm a-I'm a keep it thug till the day that I die 
 I'm a keep it thug till the day that I die 
 See ya - see ya boys hatin' cause you see a nigga ballin 
 Sippin-sippin on the Hennessy until a nigga fallin' 
 (Jim Jones:) 
 Jones... now I'm a push it to the limit, I was dyin' to be the boss 
 And we was up early cause grindin was a sport 
 Rewindin in my thoughts, late 90's it was cold 
 Lost a friend every month, couldn't survive another loss 
 My niggaz in the pen, until we meet again 
 Picture me in the Benz, blowin' weed in the wind 
 I caught a few cases, and now the Coupe races 
 Right through the Westside, floor seat at the Lakers, the milli-makers 
 Uh, and do you know what that money mean? 
 The wintertime turn to sunny scenes 
 50 thou' on my dungarees, I made it rain like it's thundering 
 But the money got me nervous 
 My niggaz pack guns 'cause I ain't tryin' to get murdered 
 And the feds tryin' to serve us 
 'Cause we ballin, but I'm a thug till I die 
 Until I hug the sky - Jones! 
 (Bizzy Bone:) 
 As soon as we judge you give me the grudge you get it away from me 
 Always seem to be druggin the bud, they get with the scrubs 
 I'm sittin' here waitin for somebody daily 
 Hopin for love cause shit it is hard enough, myself, get 'em away from me 
 Probably does continue to move it and groove it 
 And why you never get rid of me 
 Can never get rid of beef, nobody know me and nobody owe me, I get it myself 
 I'm earnin respect and wealth up under the belt, the baby can feel the welts 
 Been livin' in poverty, livin' and prosperous 
 Livin' in the matrix, I'm gettin' it how 
 Huh, I'm movin this shit, I stay on the edge and ready to smash 
 And we better then that, Lord I hope we kick it to get it together real fast 
 Together at last, under the bridge, you know what it is, move my ass 
 Drunk or an alcoholic I'm ballin, even if I'm crawlin 
 Quicker than fast, now get with the mass 
 The underclass is what they call it, motherfucker
