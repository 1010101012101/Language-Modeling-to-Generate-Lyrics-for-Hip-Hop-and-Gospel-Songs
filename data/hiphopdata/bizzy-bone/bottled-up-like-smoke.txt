I can still feel her 
 From distances and miles away 
 Galaxies and dimensions and cosmic aspirations 
 Are you ready? C'mon. 
 So she wants to make me pay 
 I am expected to lead the way 
 Baby, I'm on the case 
 Respect me and clean my slate 
 Save face and watch what you say 
 You the thing like I watched you play 
 Covered it up like smoke 
 Now that I'm back, you can get all your dough 
 Chorus - Jonny Craig: 
 Do the words still love you? 
 Can you secure its claim? 
 Bottled up like smoke 
 Floating over flames 
 Babe, so you expect me to endure your pain? 
 I can't wait to, oh forgive me, okay 
 I'm gon' bottle it up like smoke 
 Can you endure this flame? 
 Bridge - Bizzy Bone: 
 Say "I have no conscience, I'm all about game" 
 And I say "That's shallow, and you won't change" 
 And those words hurt me in the exchange 
 So I splurge and send my tears away 
 Chorus - Jonny Craig (x2): 
 Do the words still love you 
 Can you secure its claim 
 Bottled up like smoke 
 Floating over flames 
 You talk about the women that I'm running with 
 And why you even care about the women that I'm running with? 
 The funny thing is I can't remember when you was the only woman that was running it 
 Coming here and talking that gutter shit 
 The money was good then it was good with the covenant 
 The money got low and you rolled for the what of it 
 The better you test when I'm broke with no lovin' 
 And I'm floating over the flames and maintain my thuggishness 
 Ready for the world, steady my palms and pearl 
 And the pearl of the man from sayin' it's my girl 
 Twirl the baton my God 'cause I twerk 
 Gonna get it gotta get it and that's when I hurl 
 The word that I'll honor forever is that I love the bitch 
 Excuse me let me dig it on that dime down and say excuse miss 
 Excuse me let me dig it on that dime down and say excuse miss 
 Chorus - Jonny Craig: 
 Do the words still love you? 
 Can you secure its claim? 
 Bottled up like smoke, 
 Floating over flames 
 Bizzy Bone: 
 Say "I have no conscience, I'm all about game" 
 And I say "That's shallow, and you won't change" 
 And those words hurt me in the exchange 
 So I splurge and send my tears away 
 Chorus (Jonny Craig) (x2): 
 Do the words still love you? 
 Can you secure its claim? 
 Bottled up like smoke 
 Floating over flames
