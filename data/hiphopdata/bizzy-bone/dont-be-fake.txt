Verse 1: Bizzy Bone 
 I was rollin' the I-80, Holdin' the vibe baby, 
 Police up in this bitch ou know they hate me, 
 Wit' a mothafucka to search me and a mothafucka to curse me, 
 And it all end up to the walkin' it like you not dirty birdy, 
 Bringin' it most certainly you don't want me, 
 Quit frontin' on hata hata hata hata, Quit stuntin' 
 Plain and simple bluntin', Nothin' but nothin' that equals nothin', 
 And still walkin' need and that somethin', 
 Vision a perfect women, A Vision a perfect women, 
 Cha cha check out my melody, Cha cha check out my rhythm, 
 Inspiration is God spiritually we can see, In the name of our Lord and savior, 
 Jesus Christ it's whatever you need, Break bread so the demons can eat, 
 Handle my money like Evona it's just me the G, 
 Call what chu wanna call it, Feel me I'm in a venna, 
 Shut up so you can get some real manner, 
 My momma my Rossanna danna, Just me and my Joanna, 
 Hey pick up yo stamina, Hit em' like wow, 
 You know I love my style, I'm not a faker I'm the real, 
 I'm walkin' in my sins in this precious meddle and steal 
 If you want me don't be fake and don't have the nerve to try to play me like you real 
 ...

 Verse 2: Bizzy Bone 
 It was a setup, 
 Mothafucka don't ever think I let up, 
 I peeped out now that movin', 
 When you get up, 
 For the women that never loved me, 
 Only just to wipe away my smile, 
 Was it jealousy? 
 Mad cause my hair was wild, 
 Ain't no vanady, 
 Never was surrounded by no enimies, 
 One glass of henessey, 
 Mind on the trinity, 
 Heavenly, Sombody got pissed, 
 At the carcus, 
 Give me a leaf, 
 And let me break down college studies, 
 And callas, Ballas, Shot callas, 
 I'm comin' up, 
 Dug up out the grave, 
 Now pay attention to the thug, 
 Can you try that? 
 Fellamina Robert and Masadonia,

 Can you buy that? 
 Plus the one that I gave u, 
 A real diamond, 
 No cubic serconia, 
 Headed for Mariah 
 Like it's right around the corner, (Soldier) 
 Shanaya said it best, 
 I guess it's war, 
 So what they fuck you think I landed on this fuckin' planet for? 
 Now keep the lust, 
 Eat the cutchy 'cause I no you stees, 
 I heard you say that you was lovin', 
 But you said it why they dissin' me, dissin' me. dissin' me, 
 Why they dissin' me?

 Don't get mad when I pop up wit' ice, 
 Little haters,

 Homeboy grab girly if you wanna, 
 But he want even claim her, 
 Fuckin' same dude tryna frame us,
