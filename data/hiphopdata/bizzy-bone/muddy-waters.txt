And that's life in the city kid 
 Everbody ain't gon make it out the hood 
 You wanna flow like bizzy did 
 Just keep the faith 
 And it's all to the good 
 Your girl is cheating on you 
 You finna go to jail 
 Now you just lost your job 
 Your house is up for sale 
 Your friend just passed away 
 Before you said goodbye 
 Your son going to war 
 And you still don't know why 
 Your mum contracted aids 
 And right before she died 
 She could'ntspeak a word 
 But she can blink her eyes 
 See she was paralyzed 
 And you so scared to cry 
 You wanted to show her your strength 
 And tell her the lord provides 
 The church is taking money 
 Selling granny a dream 
 She wanna a go to heaven 
 Think she can get it with green 
 Your cousins gettin' rich 
 Off of a triple beam 
 You see him losing weight 
 It's started off with greens 
 It elevated with rocks 
 And now he's on the pipe 
 He used to ride 22" 
 Now cousin ride a bike 
 Your mama got a man 
 Her man he got a temper 
 So he beat you right up 
 Gets drunk and don't remember 
 As soon as you go to school 
 Your teacher asked what happened? 
 Your peers they know the story 
 You say ain't nothing cracking 
 Your money's runnning low 
 And it ain't no welfare 
 Remember PAC said "who in the hell cares? " 
 But bizzy cared for you 
 See I can only stay? 
 These are the muddy waters 
 That I can see and hear (repeat) 
 And that's life in the city kid 
 Everbody ain't gon make it out the hood 
 You wanna flow like bizzy did 
 Just keep the faith 
 And it's all to the good (repeat) 
 You had your 4 friends 
 And you all grew up together 
 On the corner swingin' rhymes 
 Singing the vibe? together 
 Breaking bread stealing cars and staying in trouble 
 House partys with the homies 
 And then watching 'em rumble 
 But soon your friendship crumbles 
 As you grow up in life 
 You reached the age of 30 
 And soon forget your plight? 
 What if they blew up 
 And became the biggest group ever 
 I guess we'll never know 
 That's just the way it goes 
 Having highschool dreams of turning pro 
 Catch an injury and now the scouts? ain't around no more 
 Studying to be a doctor but get pregnant in school 
 You decided to keep your child 
 And now you must provide the food 
 At the tender age of 50 
 Reaching your golden years 
 These are the muddy waters 
 That I can see and I hear 
 Bizzy cared for you 
 But baby I can only stay 
 These are the muddy waters 
 That I can and I hear 
 And that's life in the city kid 
 Everbody ain't gon make it out the hood 
 You wanna flow like bizzy did 
 Just keep the faith 
 And it's all to the good
