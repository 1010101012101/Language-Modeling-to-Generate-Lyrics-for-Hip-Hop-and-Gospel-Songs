 " You mothapukkas say mothaphukkas is comin' afta us. 
 Ya mothaphukkas! Let me tell you why I'm turnin' out foe next, this whole new 
 Mothaphukkin Millennium. You know whutI'm sayin' I ain't never been no cryin 
 Nigga, I just come out here and phukk witchu mothaphukkas out here in tha 
 Media. Because y'all twist shit around. And tha only way a nigga could get high 
 And really get his point across, is if you turnin' thangs out it's mothaphukkin 
 Self. Just like MTV, dem mothaphukkas CONSTANTLY say how I got arrested at tha 
 MTV Awards, but they neva say how I was Vindicated. How all tha charges waz 
 Bull sh#t. Because they don't want to. Snatchin' a Strippa's purse in New York, 
 But you won't hear about it except on ADLIBS you know whutI'm sayin'? But I'ma 
 Give you a praylude to tha whole level. Dem Bitches was lyin' on me, man, dem 
 Mothaphukkas just wanted an autograph.Cause a nigga was off tha mothaphukkin 
 Hook, ya heard'? And that's whut I've been on tha whole mothaphukkin time. You 
 KnowwhutI'm sayin'? And everybody a Thug now. EVERY PHUKKIN BODY A THUG. If I 
 See anotha 
 Tatto on anotha nigga's stomach, I swear (ta God), if I see anotha nigga takin' 
 Tupac's mothaphukkin' Tru S's, and tryin' ta milk it and makin' establishments 
 And profits off some bull sh#t, Man I been, done went to tha temple, like Jesus 
 Did and last all you mothaphukkas foe sellin' tha word. QUIT SNICHIN' ON THA 
 Community.
