(Feat. Beyonce) 
 (Bizzy Bone:) 
 Stuck at the crossroads 
 Look how we cross toes, 
 Hit 'em with a crossbow, 
 Feelin' we're lost, no, 
 Hit 'em with sauce show, 
 Listenin' off low, 
 Willin' to toss mo, 
 Dough that I don't own costs mo, 
 Pain for the aim, 
 In my brain, 
 When I feel like I'm going insane, 
 Without a plan but the lord knows, 
 How can I floss when no one listens to the boss, though, 
 How in the hell do we prevail when they all know, 
 Fall no, 
 Never fought no, 
 Never caught no, 
 Never brought no, 
 Still be goin' off, though, 
 They wouldn't listen if we give it in morse code, 
 Scream till we hoarse in the throat, 
 And force those, 
 To listen 
 Listen 
 I am alone at a crossroads (Stuck at the crossroads) 
 I'm not at home in my own home 
 And I've tried and tried 
 To say what's on my mind 
 You should have known 
 Now I'm done believing you 
 You don't know what I'm feeling 
 I'm more than what 
 You've made of me 
 I followed the voice, you gave to me 
 But now I've gotta find my own 
 You should have listened 
 (Bizzy Bone:) 
 Feelin' so free, not to struggle and strife, 
 The test of my life, 
 And oh what a price, 
 Now shakin' the dice, 
 The snake my eyes, 
 My eyes on the prize, 
 Soon realize, 
 Stuck in the world, stuck in my sleep, stuck in my dreams, 
 I pray the lord my soul to keep if I should die before I wake I count my sheep now, 
 How can I floss when no one listens to the boss, though, 
 How in the hell do we prevail when they all know, 
 Fall no, 
 Never fought no, 
 Never caught no, 
 Never brought no, 
 Still be goin' off, though, 
 They wouldn't listen if we give it in morse code, 
 Scream till we hoarse in the throat, 
 And force those 
 (Beyonce:) 
 I don't know where I belong 
 But I'll be moving on 
 If you don't, if you won't 
 Listen to the song here in my heart 
 A melody I start, but I will complete 
 Now I am done believing you 
 You don't know not what I am feeling 
 I'm more than what you've made of me 
 I followed the voice you think you gave to me 
 But now I got to find my own - my own
