('Cause I know I'm son of the survivor -vivor -vivor...) 
 Get up and wash my ass and damn, she was just another one night 
 Stand 
 For big dick daddy, 'case you heard 
 'Cause she was just another one night stand, 'cause she was just 
 Another one 
 Get up and wash my ass and damn, she was just another one night 
 Stand 
 For big dick daddy, 'case you heard 
 'Cause she was just another one night stand. 'cause she was just 
 Another one 
 Get up and wash my ass and damn, she was just another one night 
 Stand 
 For big dick daddy, 'case you heard 
 (Bizzy Bone) 
 Remember when you're all alone, my cellular phone 
 Was turned off, smokin' burners with my dogs, and it's all good 
 Baby 
 Everyone who steal the flow, all y'all some hoes 
 Shermed out, let's make some mo' money, 
 I'm kinda hungry, it's all good, haters 
 I don't wanna rock 'em if they study another Bone role 
 Will they do the run in when their comin', when I'm rollin' in 
 My home 
 A son of a bitch, I gotta cough, cough in the summer 
 Love of thug nigga, from my calico, I felt I was losin' my mind 
 There was some other kind, really wanna smoke the weed, after 
 You swallow me 
 And try not to follow me, blind, find me 69 
 Real lit, smokin', the finest vintage wine, talkin' bout time 
 With me 
 And you wanna to be something, more than just a dime to me 
 (Bizzy Bone) 
 The bitch can cut me, fuck my homies 
 Be a dyke and spike my Hennessy, 
 Have babies by one of my enemies (then, then) 
 Come and pretend she wanna be grinned 
 They probably, wanna send me to the end of the cliff 
 Inherit all of my chips and then go spend it with another nigga 
 Well, in my shit and lickin' my lick, nobody does it better than 
 The Rip 
 That's the shit, welcome the widow, keeping the pistol grip 
 Under my pillow, well, when you peep out the window, it's so 
 Cold. 
 Get in 'fore the wind blow 
 No hoes allowed -lowed -lowed. Get in 'fore the wind blow 
 No hoes allowed, no hoes allowed, no hoes allowed 
 That bitch can cluck and fuck my homies 
 Be a dyke and spike my Hennessy, 
 Have babies by one of my enemies, then, then, then 
 Man the chicks can cut me, fuck my homies 
 Be a dyke and spike my Hennessy, 
 Have babies by one of my enemies, then, then, then, then, then 
 (Bizzy Bone) 
 I woke up early in the mornin' with my glock, you're fine, 
 Yawnin' 
 Smellin' like last night's Hen, till the crack of dawn we get it 
 On 
 Then again, nigga reel it down from me, just 'cause we're T-H-U-Gs 
 But the money was abundant, start up my family tree 
 Eager to move, we live and we die in Cleveland, 
 That same week or sell speakers 
 Bid for insurance, and that ass won't free my people with 
 Warrants 
 Over there, come call us, all this over a hoe 
 My homeboy has no dough and wants to force it, let me know 
 What a crazy ass life, play me right, don't play me twice 
 Damn, I'm a grown man, getting in big fights, It'd be nice to 
 Settle down 
 Yeah right, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right, yeah right, yeah 
 Right 
 Man, a bitch can't cut me. 
 Fuck my homies, homies, homies, homies (I'm still high) 
 And be a dyke and spike my Hennessey, then, then, then (it's all 
 Right.) 
 Have babies by one of my enemies, 
 Have babies by one of my enemies (I'm still high) 
 Phone jury, call the police, they can never hold me. (I'm still 
 High) 
 Eventually, you're gonna remember me 
 (Chorus: till end)
