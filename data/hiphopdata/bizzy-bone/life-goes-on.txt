Mmm-hmm, Mr. Shakur, man, your essence remains pure... 
 And by the freedom of God, we got a sure shot, and Jesus-you've been good to me 
 When it all stops, my life goes on for sure, Mr. Shakur and blessed with your 
 Presence, your essence remains pure... 
 Verse One: 
 I never made it in school in '92, lookin' for a job as a part-time father, only 
 If you knew Pac, with the chronic through your music was gettin' me through, it's 1999 
 Now, what we gone do, huh, ya oh! enemies snicker when I pour out a 
 Little liquor, better not pass me your name and make you out to be the sinner 
 Who spent the holiday with that ghetto, cookin a hood dinner, writin my memoirs 
 Right next to your picture, remember: Life Goes On, that's what you told me 
 Homie, and Sylk~E~Fine hooked it up in the nick of time you know me-shit, I may be 
 Lonely and I talk to you, I hope you listening and we mob through you, we all miss 
 Him, and mommy say hey, she feed the babies, Johnny J still crazy as hell, 
 Takin' your class in college, hope I don't fail, I wish I had the mail for the 
 Million dollar bill, but that'd be too much like writin the whole situation, 
 And it smells kind of fishy to me, bring the demons to the light, the truth-it 
 Might set me free, but they can't kill you twice, by the freedom of God we have 
 A sure shot, and Jesus you have been so good to me... 
 Verse Two: 
 Yo, my friends ain't feelin' me, tobacco companies make money off of killin' me, 
 We been waitin for forty acres like we said it, damn, and the earthquakes with 
 The world's retaliation, all the abomination, call it El Nino, but it feels 
 Like revelation, huh, and Pac they got to you, you don't think I think a fan shot 
 You, they was jealous of your jewelry, and the jury thought they got you, I 
 Fast, prepare for the rapture with a ? for the ghetto bastards, walk in the 
 Wilderness with God given talent for ashes, pass the pastor, he ain't helpin 
 The hood like judges should, but life goes on, it's all good, and homie we 
 Fight for wood, to keep us stupid huh, and after Eazy, it ain't no more 
 Ruthless acoustics, same producers seduce us, with jewels to boost us, before 
 We prove 'em wrong, kinda revolutionary to move us, but life goes on, 
 Within the music and the song, it's abusive if you use it to fuel your fire, 
 Huh... 
 Verse Three: 
 Supportin my people, distortin my people, they callin my people, evil is finders keepers losers weep 
 The reaper, all you G's now, proposition 187, and you think we sleep now, how 
 In the new millennium could we smile, God loves the underdog, and of course the 
 Ghettos are close, just when the rain falls, reminisce on tattoos, the oceans, 
 Pain y'all, note here for the dosage of prozac he prescribed, ther's too much 
 Melanin in my system, musical group, we won't die, and what's the meaning of 
 Survival, knowledge of wealth is right there in your biblem look at the literal 
 And learn yourself, pass me the lighter when I'm stressin on these issues, did 
 I mention my momma gonna need some tissue when they get you, I continue to flow 
 Eternal, remember Mo Murda way back in the day, smokin' burners with lil Layzie, 
 Man we shootin at the turtle, him and his big boyz doggin me out, I'm all alone 
 With my Thuggish Ruggish shirt on, but still many, I don't hate you, we black 
 And strong, even though I know right where you live, I forgive you and life goes on...
