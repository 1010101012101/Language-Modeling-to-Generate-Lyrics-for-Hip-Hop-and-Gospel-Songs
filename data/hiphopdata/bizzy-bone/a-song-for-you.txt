I love you in a place, Where there's no space or time 
 I love you, for the life, You're a friend of mine 
 And when my life is over, Remember when we were together 
 We were alone, & I was singing this song to you 
 (Bizzy 1st Verse) 
 Fully-Automatic, Whateva you want to know 
 He got's to cry, let up 
 Stand in the back and ready, Attack 
 And ready for combat, I 
 Heavly heated, Weeded, Beat it, Need it, See it 
 Get it?, Ge it?, Get it?, Good, Don't get it missunderstood 
 My homey lonely, Homey, Walking and we talking fo'sho 
 And I'm'a be with him in the end with for giveness, no more 
 And remember the words are perfict, How could I be worthy? 
 And when I feel so dam dirty, Dirty 
 By leaning on a leaning chair, Baby ain't here yet, 
 Henny, Caffeine, & nicotine, Notice I left out the green? 
 Notice I never brake a set, Whos that? Fuck it 
 I don't even know the chick, I don't even know that shit 
 Ex me, Perplex me, Flex on decks man 
 Chastment, Investment, Quiet as kept 
 I say now, 
 (Man, Man, Man, Man) 
 Ex me, Perplex me, Flex on decks man 
 Chastment, Investment, Quiet as kept 
 Fair?

 (DMX 2nd Verse) {With Bizzy) 
 Mad streesed, that I can't even sleep were I rest 
 So now I were a vest, but what if I don't catch it in the chest 
 Then I'm out, just like the light when the powers gone 
 And there's another tombstone, the childs putin flowers on 
 Long live the dream, of making enough creem 
 Were I won't have to skeem, or roll around with the team 
 And niggas I can't trust, & I mite have to bust 
 For a somethin' (Don't know) Rim, Comin' from (Come on) the fuss 
 It's to much to bare, & everyday is getting worse 
 Got me plotin on my peeps, & how to get'em first 
 It's something to make a nigga strive, & stay {Alive} 
 So I wach my own back, {With a back 45} 
 (Bizzy) 
 Are thay coming? Thay coming to get us 
 I'm ready For eva, They'll never defeat you 
 They'll never deceit you! 
 (DMX) 
 WHAT!, Come on

 And were are thay coming? Thay coming to get us 
 I'm ready For eva, They'll never defeat you 
 They'll never deceit you! 
 (DMX) 
 Yeah!, Come on
