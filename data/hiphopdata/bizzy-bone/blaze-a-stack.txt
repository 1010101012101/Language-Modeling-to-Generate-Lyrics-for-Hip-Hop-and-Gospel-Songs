 Come Bizzy why you blazin' sacks?/I sit back in the cut roll a pound of compress weed in my nutsack/Niggas tryin' ta jack I hammer that/Sendin ya back to Cleveland with that goody good/Woodfellaz keep that greedy woody wood down south/And put tha put tha gat down a bitches mouth/You got problems on the edge?/We'll solve em, slide early deep to the Lex/Hit 'em up and rob em/Have you ever saw a four chess 'n' overload?/That's when the bullets explode dis how we roll/Runnin' from the po po's cause were neva clean/Went from workin triple beam, weighin up bigga 'n' betta

 Come here see this, my nizzle foshizzle fa sho/Nizzle 'n' sizzle with stack at his door/And it's god (Play me)/Shoot at Cali ta gold, with my mind body 'n' soul (Blow blow blow)/I've been in control let me, when them women lets go/Blaze the track, you blaze the sack/I bang my stack, my niggas in prison they comin' back/Thangs is hectic niggas get back/And even if I catch the bullet, you know I'm comin' back for my chedda/Resprect me (Respect G's!)/Grab a gat confess, Eazy the curse make a brotha (Sean) play to be blessed/Nevertheless I ain't manifested with the wind from my chest/And I don't stop, till the cops rest/(Come on!) Time test smokin' even heavy and fuck the status/Roll my diamond in the ghetto with weapons, these niggas gettin' ready/So leave it or weed it and cut off all my hair, make you mothafuckas believe it put it the air

 Givin' doubt to them real niggas (Woodfella)/Know what's up, show no love to them fake niggas/I could give a fuck about five foot five undaground and I'm crunk/But the sign say 'Name' cause you could get jumped and dumped on stomped by these country ass niggas down hea/Where my real niggas at?/Drink a fifth of that Coniac, Hennessy got me gettin' down from my ground/By myself and I ain't on my side of town /Fake niggas get nothin', keep truckin ya best ta beat ya feet before the creep starts a bustin/Cussin, you outta time (Time)/I'm already deep, so you know what's on my mind (Mind)/This Irv got me noddin on these kids on that wheel (Fo real)/Got a barrel of that 38 steal (Fo real)/Actin' kinda wrong on this step I wish ya will/The game get hectic I'm talkin' bout fo real
