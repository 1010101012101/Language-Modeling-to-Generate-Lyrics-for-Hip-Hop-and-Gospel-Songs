Yeah, some people wonder, you know, well they say: "what have you learned"? 
 And to your left, your right, your left, your right 
 It's to your left, your right, your left, your right 
 To your left, your right, your left, march with me! 
 It's to your left, your right, your left, your right (x4) 
 What have I learned? 
 Surrounded by nothing but snakes and worms 
 What have I learned? 
 It don't matter when nobody take it, they is a concern 
 See the good in the ones that have burned 
 And you never got all that you've earned 
 Don't interrupt me, I speak to the lord 
 Heavenly choir, now we are in Church 
 In the temple, we cleaning the mental; the evil it lurks 
 Coming up off of on the corner, with dirtier thoughts 
 Here's thirty seconds to start 
 They slither like worms, they jealous of purity 
 Jealous of people in love; 
 They caught on a women, destroy the connection, they see that you happy 
 And here come the scrubs, I'm tellin' you bruh 
 They down with the serpent to get in their mind 
 Believe the people who witness the Christ 
 Look at my life, and now they blind 
 Nobody to find, they sellin' their souls without even knowing I catch em' 
 Without definitions, and give 'em reditions of scriptures and shit, 
 I keep walking knowin' is mine 
 I walk and I shine in the sublime, gotta ward of all the demons 
 Outta my thought, they caught, they gone I tell 'em sit back and wake em', 
 Literally thuggin', just come in and clog up their mind 
 What have I learned? What have I learned? 
 What have I learned? 
 Surrounded by nothing but snakes and worms 
 What have I learned? 
 It don't matter when nobody take it, they is a concern 
 See the good in the ones that have burned 
 And you never got all that you've earned 
 Don't interrupt me, I speak to the lord 
 Heavenly choir, now we are in Church 
 With a bounty on my head, and the county holdin' my mind 
 Angels grippin' my spine, dear lord, these are scandalous times 
 We livin' in revelations, nation against nation 
 Blood in the hood on the boat like Haitians 
 Me and little brother, we are runnin' for salvation 
 Everyday, comin' and facing temptation 
 Casin' joints, with the base and the point, the place with a dutch 
 Little joy, little souljah boy, you better keep your boys with no noise, no voice, and? no choice 
 Runnin', we stop, you better watch the cops, you better get off the block 
 You mean to tell me that motherfuckers is still sellin' rocks? 
 And they mob with the glock, and they nod... Allah 
 Who do you think you are? Dead in the heart 
 Dead man walking, man don't even start 
 A tear for the above, but we thuggin' in the park 
 Another? on the porch with a sawed of shotgun, let it spark, on the multitude, is that all you got? 
 Trying to shock the dude, and give him... in his heart 
 And laugh at him fast like... and the ark 
 Rubbin' the eye, you better hold that stash 
 Weeded out, and baby, even now 
 A poor child in the hood, no hood, no doubt, no wood, no mort, no dream, no style 
 Ambulances, coroners, and some that never know no doors 
 Brain cartiledge up on that floor, it's one friend, please, let me tell you one more 
 What have I learned? 
 Surrounded by nothing but snakes and worms 
 What have I learned? 
 It don't matter when nobody take it, they is a concern 
 See the good in the ones that have burned 
 And you never got all that you've earned 
 Don't interrupt me, I speak to the lord 
 Heavenly choir, now we are in Church 
 Grind in the days in a maze 
 Amazed with the phase in the plague of a homeboy blazed 
 Now the homeboy slayed in the streets, so crazed 
 Know that he prayed, that shit is played 
 It's ok, it's all right 
 Spirit will be better when you see that light 
 When you see that flight 
 And Allah provide, perfections, let's go take a ride 
 Loadin' up clips, hollow tips, ready for murder, swallow this 
 Follow this, model this; with death, you don't have to swallow shit 
 When it's bottled up and it tastes like piss 
 Ridin' on up... 
 ... With the hurt and pain, but the hurt remains 
 What have I learned? 
 Surrounded by nothing but snakes and worms 
 What have I learned? 
 It don't matter when nobody take it, they is a concern 
 See the good in the ones that have burned 
 And you never got all that you've earned 
 Don't interrupt me, I speak to the lord 
 Heavenly choir, now we are in Church
