Shake that, shake that stick 
 Wassup lil son? How you doin', baby? 
 Shake that stick 
 When the faggots try to lust your body 
 Shake that stick 
 That's my boy right there, yeah 
 Shake that stick 
 When the faggots try to lust your body 
 Suprise, it's really a bitch 
 I was raised by my papi, though, papi, though 
 Shake ya stick 
 In the strip club lookin' for a humble young thing 
 With a roll of cash money, motherfucker, get it quick, thug 
 Fellas all around me, don't sit too close to the door 
 And they gettin' naked in this motherfucker, y'all keep calm 
 Got on time, they be rollin' with dudes 
 Nothin' but attitude, gotta give me latitude 
 Bitches still mad that I don't fuck with a group 
 But I was raised by my papa and my papa told me trust no two 
 Straight veryly, and in the spiritual form, only God split so, and the spirit reborn 
 But baby still dancin 
 I see the bitches tryin' to stop me, never roll with a plan, can't copy, gimme 
 They say that two is too sloppy 
 It tops and tear at ya loppy 
 Can't even get monopoly, in the soul game 
 And the baby boy he cocky 
 And you better watch your word game, cause the shit get stocky 
 My opportunity to ration out the love for the one, my Papi 
 Motherfuckers don't know what we do, no one got me 
 Only one true God in the house for sure 
 Who you roll with? I roll with the Lord 
 Trust and believe 
 Lay low on these motherfuckers, break those jaws 
 And what you see is what the fuck they saw 
 We ain't fuckin' with nobody who don't represent the Father of all 
 And that's God y'all 
 That stick 
 When the faggots try to lust your body 
 Surprise, I said it really was a bitch 
 I was raised by my papi 
 And tell 'em they'll never win 
 Because they caught up in the sin 
 And we drinks for free 
 Shake that stick 
 When the faggots try to lust your body 
 Surprise, it was really a bitch 
 And I was raised by my papi 
 Can you tell 'em they'll never win 
 And they get caught up in the sin 
 Round here, we drink for free 
 She was playin' on deception 
 And spiritually was a dead-end 
 Mountin the battle station 
 And we bring on no weapons 
 For the inception of the relationship, I guess I shoulda known 
 She was playin' for deception and spiritually she was dead 
 And mountin up the battle station, bring no weapons 
 The inceptions of the relationship 
 I guess I shoulda known when she said she had us caught up on tape 
 Bitch, we ain't even bone 
 This warfare goes deep in the clones 
 Cheaper when they come up to park their shit 
 Demons is on 
 Quick, Cleveland get gone 
 But I don't speak about the radius 
 A hardcore brother with the Father and the capius 
 The athiests, bitch ass demons, they don't need no athiests 
 Fuck em, they should bust their ass 
 Cocksuckin break, bitch 
 Tell me where the tunes at 
 Iknowwhoyourollinwit 
 Secrets tellin', they better lose that all 
 Baby, We get it poppin' down in the city streets 
 Either don't roll with neither one of these bitches 
 They gonna reak 
 Don't sleep till the mission complete 
 I got a treat for the honey 
 And man, honey is sweet 
 Yeah, shake ya stick 
 And the faggots try to lust your body 
 Surprise, really a bitch 
 I was raised by my papi 
 And I was raised by my papi 
 Yeah, that stick 
 When the faggots try to lust your body 
 Surprise, baby, it was only a bitch 
 And I was raised by my papi 
 Tell 'em they'll never win 
 And they'll caught up in the sin 
 Round here, we drink for free 
 Tell 'em again 
 Shake that stick 
 Shake that stick 
 Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay! 
 Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay! 
 Shake that stick 
 It's when the faggots try to lust your body 
 Baby surprise, it was really a bitch

 You know the rules

 Represent it, confess with the tongue, you know 
 You know, what you throwin' up, cool?
