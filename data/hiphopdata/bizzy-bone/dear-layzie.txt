Baby, you go to realize that these young motherfuckers that you caught yourself rollin' with, these lil' niggas don't know nothin' about no loyalty. These niggas ain't on no damn amish shit, baby. These niggas come from the streets, they come from broken homes. They ain't used to nobody stickin' with 'em never. So they gon' always gon be alone, baby. You come from the same place don't ya? It was good wasn't it? Wasn't it? 
 Bizzy Bone 
 See my life is backwards, Lil' Layzie was my nigga to the fullest/ Two semi-automatic bullets with the afro rockin' crack spot I'm clockin' hell-a money with my sisters/ I met him and it was on and poppin/ We did ya talent shows, and messed with highschool hoes/ In the city of Cleveland's rememberin' Bizzy Bone/ I was down to kill niggas, the first to swing last of the real niggas/ I'm down for anything, anything/ So now I'm all alone, and you let Krayzie diss me/ Just tell me, how could he be so damn pissed at me? I never fucked his girl, I never took his money/ How could you just ride with him? You ain't smellin' somethin' funny? 
 Sellin' dope, tryin' to make a lil' dividends/ When I was shootin' niggas you was my only friend/ Sellin dope, tryin' to make a lil' dividends/ When I was shootin' (Shootin'...) niggas you was my only friend
