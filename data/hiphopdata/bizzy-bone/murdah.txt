Murdah is out of control/ Murdah just let it blow (It blow)/ Word up if you bucked a mothafucka down for taken ya dough (Taken ya dough...) nigga 
 -Bizzy Bone- 
 Know this liquor prolly killin' my liver/ The villain is still in effect/ And I buck this motherfucker down, live and direct/ Hey, what I'ma chastise my momma? Demand the respect, get up and strategize bitches cryin like they never wept/ Slept in the gutter with no tech, I'm still in the dungeon/ Bitch I never left, pass that sticky icky ganja/ Creep on ah come up, I crept and I came/ Respect the dead game, remember ta let ya nuts hang, often, matter of fact I'ma do mine all day/ I don't sniff coke, I like to make money/ Put the fiends in the room, who's hungry? Cut from the cloth they cut me black cherry weed/ Cherokee Indians based in Cleveland, thuggin' and thievin till I'm the last one breathin/ Only one believin is that Seventh Sign Saga/ Fresh and remodeled, plush like Ramada now, holy like Ramadan, a momma's smile/ Capo, my nigga what/ Nigga execution always my guns is crippin 'cause, P.B.D. posse/ I roll with Rasu, Nina Ross, and Skails, Rhythm and Ghetto, Rosiah, 7th Sign murda 'em all, yep... 
 And like little Capo-Confuscious say 'Nigga I'll kill for you.' 
 -Prince Rasu- 
 We can't get fucked, baby, take precaution fo' sho'/ They say that nigga Gotti quiet, better fire of a Calico/ Bastard, I'm a animal/ My guradians was avenues/ My Lord be my shepherd, but I swarms for collatoral/ Who can I trust? Where can I turn? When will it all end? I'm suited up in Timberland boots, Regime marchin' God damnit I'm a grown man, time to take my own stand/ Fuck the federations, my heart is racin' like grown mens/ Fucked with the anger built up from years of stress, killers and haters surround me daily, no fears of death/ I hear the breaths of angels and demons fightin' over my soul/ Lord, just give me the path through this bloodbath and it's on, Lord/ Roll all haters, out my zone when it's goin' down/ Ride with the 7th Sign/ Violate, we gone clown/ Four pounds be safe in the streets of the showdown/ Love to Gambino, you the chief, dog/ Chi-town youngsta 
 -Josiah Rasu- 
 Cock back and blast, knockin' sparks up out they ass/ Makin' marks come off that cast, nigga you know what it is, think I'm serious/ Then heart attack, missles aimed straight at where the fuck your heart is at/ Fix cement or get hit, how hard is that, to comprehend, I'm tryin' to be gone before them souljahs come marchin in/ You blue suit wearin faggets with badges'll get the flux, I don't give a fuck who you are we can send this motherfucker up/ Crucifixion come quickly come and get me Mister Reeper/ I ain't scared to die/ I'm all like more than willin', the more the real the more that feel it, so I'ma stay real until my heart stop/ My reflection with hoes, the essence of the hard-knock life/ I am the light, and if you miss us then you misses haven't heard of murder/ Then you don't know of pain, my veins bleed the same blood of the motherfuckers who murdered my momma so I'm a natural born killa/ Than I, there was no cap peelas
