(Chorus - Bizzy Bone) 
 And for all the drama that's goin' on 
 And for all the drama drama 
 And for all the drama that's goin' on 
 Pop pop pop pop 
 One of these stress pills in your mouth... 
 (Verse 1 - Capo) 
 In the midst in the darkest nights 
 Sparkin off the highest flights 
 And project buildings blastin civilians 
 But skull-white from cycles of the psycho children 
 Millions in the revenue, what we seek in these avenues 
 Steady breakin down crumbs for the Royal Crown 
 Amongst animals, to the half of you 
 Understand the mindstate of the most official 
 I ride with this demonstration, you will die for your fuckin' issues 
 It's drama kickin off, infrared lasers is blazin' hot 
 Burnin up your whole block, lord forgive them they no not 
 Fuck a cop. with the blood clot, buck 'em till they holla 
 We gon let it rain like Nina Ross 
 With Tommy-gun-monsta rockets 
 Eventually niggaz die by crashes of crimson tide 
 Slippin time in yo life, lines is fallen... I'm energized 
 It's live baby, airin' out your strip with fo-fives 
 Crazy drama get solved with fatal rocka bye-bye's babay 
 (Verse 2 - Bizzy Bone) 
 Drama's runnin' up on ya 
 When I come round the corner with a pocketful of marijuana 
 Got full of void, and got me searchin for the telly 
 Takin' to my celly, put out the order 
 And tell 'em bust it in ya mother fuckin' belly 
 Ain't you ready? 
 If the world should end again, I don't really wanna 
 But I'm gonna be ready for the ending 
 That's the drama, and if you really wanna 
 You can date it right back to the beginning 
 Now who's the fillin villain of karma 
 Orginal militant be marchin in armours 
 Guess who, Guess who, Guess who, Guess who... 
 And comin' out the kitchen, plenty ammunition 
 Runnin', buckin, jumpin' outta the window 
 My gun bustin' and bleedin so fast 
 Bleedin from the glass 
 Tellin' myself 'jump up and let off another blast' 
 Through the alleys in a beat-up Malley 
 To the riots in Pelican Bay 
 Where the fellas say pop-pop-pop everyday 
 (Verse 3 - Big B) 
 Floss mode, for my people 
 Got me rappin' crap where I shouldn't be 
 Layed back, fucked up on hennesey 
 Bitch you know me 
 Dem diggin, daggin everythang 
 Now how the fuck am I gonna get rich? 
 'Cause lick, jack that bitch, kill this bitch 
 Hide this bitch, hop in the Benz with bizzy 
 Promise you won't say shit 
 Sing, for the Calico 
 Yes, I believe in God 
 Run up in on his car door 
 Homeboy you gotta die 
 Meet your maker, never no faker 
 I grind for mine, big boy I shine for mine 
 That nigga performed, impressed yo girl! 
 Doin' things your man dream about 
 Sing 
 Rap hustle
