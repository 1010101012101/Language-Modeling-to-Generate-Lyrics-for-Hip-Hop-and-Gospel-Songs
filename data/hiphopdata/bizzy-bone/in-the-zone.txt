I'm gonna walk through the front 
 On my own in the zone I'm alone 
 It is me is it bone is it you? 
 Is it me is it we is it e 
 Do we know do we know! 
 So we rock to the rhythm when they come against 
 Us it ain't no weapons of war that can come up against us! 
 And when they in bizznizz we are winners in the back who get us 
 And now we back! we got split in the back of the writers 
 I'm gonna walk through the front 
 On my own in the zone I'm alone 
 Settin the trome for next to come 
 Is it bone is it me is it you is it me 
 Is it e is it us? is it we!? 
 I say this many and it explains in the vains 
 Will I face I'm a maze and I graze for my cave 
 Not a grave I'm a slave all the pain the path the aftermath of my class 
 Now tell me can you feel that of the path of the pole of the essial on the store 
 Hit the barr see the car that we comin' in raw through the door with allah 
 Honey find her allah momma leave momma kill I'm a protect her for real 
 I'm gonna walk through the front 
 On my own in the zone I'm alone 
 It is me is it bone is it you? 
 Is it me is it we is it e 
 Do we know do we know! 
 Keepin' it rockin' and poppin' 
 No stoppin' you know that we gotta better be ready and steady 
 Heavyer then the god allah watchin the baby's 
 I better be ready for everything sing even if we would sing sing 
 You know what it is you know that I would luv you it ain't a thing 
 And allah the lord of the rings the lord of the (?) 
 How did he find everything that exists 
 And Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Islamic, catastrophic 
 Don't make me come up in this mothafucker 
 And get atomic and tell you this to stay away from the baby's 
 'Cause they are beautiful baby he beautiful 
 Never be left to watch that nigga because uh 
 That will be your funeral 
 Never to know cause here we come 
 Only the God, Ali Hiram Ra 
 Most beneficent, most merciful 
 The only Allah. Allah is God 
 And I'm a walk to the front 
 On my one, in the zone 
 I'm alone and I'm home 
 Mission to fuck, don't come 
 I'm gonna walk through the front 
 On my own in the zone I'm alone 
 It is me is it bone is it you? 
 Is it me is it we is it e 
 Do we know do we know! 
 And never did hurt and 
 Never did pain us 
 Whether remain a deeper effect 
 You get to pay or suffer the faith 
 Remember the great, remember the gat 
 Whenever a kat would ever forgot that sediment 
 And leave 'em a strag 
 Never did spank him remember to break 'em 
 When he keep thinking Allah's a fag 
 Never get caught, the deeper the mist 
 Ensure to go deeper diggin' into your chest 
 Never to hurt you never to argue 
 When can I jerk you, when can I hurt you 
 Ready for less, their could've been more 
 Your ready to talk, is it pure 
 Never lure if it were Allah 
 So what am I here for 
 I'm gonna walk through the front 
 On my own in the zone I'm alone 
 It is me is it bone is it you? 
 Is it me is it we is it e 
 Do we know do we know!
