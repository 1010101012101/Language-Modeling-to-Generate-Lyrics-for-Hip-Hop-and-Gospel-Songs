I am not john 
 I am not Jesus 
 And I could never be jewdist 
 I can't be a harlet 
 I could never be a dragon 
 My name is bryon 
 I am a slave of allah 
 The master of creations 
 The creater with all the alligators 
 The birds the bees the trees and all that existed 
 And if the big bang theere was actually true 
 Then you must explain to me 
 Explain to me flesh 
 Eplain to me equalisation 
 And explain to me neffa
