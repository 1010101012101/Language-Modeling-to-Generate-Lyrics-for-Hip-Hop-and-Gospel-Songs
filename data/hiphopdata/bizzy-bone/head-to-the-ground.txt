(Bizzy Bone) 
 While I was walkin' in tha column, and all 
 Help the medicine go down 
 Heavenly fatha don't be made at us now 
 It's been ah long way commin 
 And we don't plan on goin' back 
 Head to tha ground 
 Head to tha ground 
 And through the cymetary gins 
 And talkin' like they my friends 
 I don't worry about death 
 'Cause I don't know what's happenin' wit my kids 
 I neva pray God for the ends 
 Not as much as I spend 
 Nor do I depends 
 Livin' and sinnin dennin 
 Ready to burn tha bridge 
 And I wish this drama drama 
 All would cease 
 By walkin' tha streets 
 Do without my heat heat 
 Lookin' at my feet 
 And the only time of peace 
 Wuz when we got high 
 I know you got urs 
 That's why I got mine got mine big bitch 
 My nigga nine went ta jail 4 it 
 Anotha nigga lost 
 But shoulda be woulda been betta off 
 I don't know tha ansas 
 And see we chance off 
 Somebody takes a stand jaw 
 Satan got ah plan y'all 
 But man gotta follow 
 See most of my friends is hollow 
 And I pray for em 
 And I say for em 
 Lord thank you (live my life) 
 That I'm half way home 
 Goin' on and on 
 Help tha medicine go down (2x) 
 Rest 'n' peace 
 Walkn talkin' ta God 
 Prayn for forgivness 
 And see I say for this 
 'Cause I pray 4 this 
 Instead I get laid down ta tha pavement 
 By tha same niggaz that wuz listenin ta what I'm was sayin' 
 Stay sadated heavely stressed out (thug (5x) 
 I need ah vacation 
 Go ta tha schools and help lil kids eduacation 
 Let all of the hata hata hata hatas 
 Some of the old folks 
 Can't stand it 
 Betta make way 
 Here comes that new generation 
 Heaven'l make us 
 Hope y'all don't be choken hatred 
 Lets face it 
 Sum niggas I know 
 Reminds me of them multi races 
 If I ain't say it 
 Sumbody else woulda said it 
 R we ready 4 death and destruction 
 I already read it 
 I won't let it 
 Messiah come on 
 Lets ride for tha cause 
 Say we all shall overcome 
 Come all 
 God gon make tha laws 
 (Layzi bone) 
 Nigga have you eva been undecided 
 Bout committin tha violence 
 Strugglin ta fight it 
 Livn this life but you just don't like it 
 Makn niggas break dey self 'cause ah nigga can't buy it 
 My mind feelin' so ziggity 
 Waitn for tha day that tha lord come get 
 Pick me up and carry me home

 Till tha day that I die I'll be stumpin 
 Marchin in big black boots 
 Dumpin striait up chargin deze niggaz dumpin 
 Lock and load that's what I holla holla holla 
 To all tha real niggas that's ready in tha field everyday 
 Gotta risk they life for that dolla 
 Grab your weapons tightn yo laces

 Everywere we go its dem ghetto races 
 Calcasions facen this jail time 
 Represented there crime

 On tha grind its about that mail time 
 In tha middle of it all heaven or hell

 Keep it real nigga save your soul 
 And tha world so cold

 When the trumpets sound 
 When it all go down

 When the good lord blow it 
 Bb and lay goin' home wit our head down 
 To tha ground
