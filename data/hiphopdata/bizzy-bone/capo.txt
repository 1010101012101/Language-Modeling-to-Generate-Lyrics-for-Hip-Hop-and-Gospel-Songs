H.I.T.L.A.H. Capo-Confuscious- 
 {Gun cocked and a gunshot} Waitin' on the bail whiles I sittin' in the county jail/ Question my intuition 'What have I gotten myself into this time?' One of those situations change your whole outlook on life/ Despite the hardships we shall overcome, victorious/ 7th Sign Regime, the most notorious thugs you ever seen/ Holdin' the lead, follow me, my nigga as we ride front, back, and side to side/ Ladies jockin, keep on bobbin' your head/ Like the way we rock it? Yeah, bitch! {police sirens}
