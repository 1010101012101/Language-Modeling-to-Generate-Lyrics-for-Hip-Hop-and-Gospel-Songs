(Yeah, yeah,...) 
 Yeah, 
 One time for they mind baby, 
 (Buc, buc, buc, buc-buc, buc, buc-buc, buc...) 
 Keep the wicked numbers away, haters, 
 I know you want some, but you can't get none, 
 And its said for those that we are put around, if they don't entertain us, 
 Shall we continue to be around them, no we shall not, 
 Get on about your business, 
 One time for they mind, give it to 'em baby 
 (Choruse) 
 And what, ima do it, just keep 'em away, without worrying about a thang, 
 And you know my name, I'm not taking the blame, not playing the game, 
 Evolution of elevation is way bigger then your big bang, 
 Explain to me breath, explain to me breasts, explain to me death mayne 
 Heaven is high, how you doing as I'm walking by, 
 I've been in the blur, heat of war, and enemies ain't talkin' right, 
 I don't have the time, ain't a speck of no love up in here, 
 Allah I pray you forgive me for closing my eyes and ears, 
 Nobody wanna tell the truth, huh?(shh!) Nobody is real, 
 Everybody tryin' to cover up what's already revealed, 
 Why am I tortured just for tellin' the way it really is, 
 No questions asked, I'ma pass, I don't want none of that ass, 
 I don't need leaf that of fig, I can walk around here naked, 
 No I'm not Mr. Shakur, I'm so secure in the Matrix, 
 I'm baking up in this blanket, your fire is Child's Play, 
 Chucky, I'll stomp you to pieces and take him out my way, 
 We prayin' like everyday, see you at the crossroads, 
 I'm gonna miss everybody, cryin' for the lost souls, 
 Horses, fire, and crossbows; the righteous that lost those, 
 My titans in cornrows, ignite 'em then turn slow 
 Now what I want you to do right here man, 
 Is I want you to flip it like you used to flip it way, way back in the days, 
 Now you gotta get back to that man, you know what I'm saying, 
 Right before you done cut your hair, I want you to flip it on 'em baby, 
 Iight cool 
 Generals sit at the desk, and please pay attention, we selling our sales and units and 
 And informing them midst of the moment of you and then everything that he was doing, 
 See heaven is high, now get with the real, we studying islam people, 
 We walking alone, without any help, and ducking like every evil, 
 Is there anything that you want me to tell you, are you learning anything new on this internet, 
 But now you've got something that you can come listen to, give 'em the real on these politics, 
 Its more and more obvious that were oblivious to any negative thinking, 
 Plus we are the warriors, slaves of allah, without any negative drinking, 
 You know what I mean, no need to go further and further the burner is serious, 
 We keep to our selves with nobody else around to make us delirious, 
 I carry this ... moving like militant soldiers, 
 Now what do you feel when all the receptions are going around your shoulders, 
 Rocks are bigger then bolders, wheter its colorado over to California, 
 The haters a demon, its looking for war, not rocks, when they runnin' up on us, 
 It's so many jealousys they'll never win they'll only be mad 'cause we back y'all 
 And there ain't no need for me to worry, allah you akbar, 
 Yeah
