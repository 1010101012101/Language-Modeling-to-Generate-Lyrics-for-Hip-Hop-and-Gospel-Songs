 Bizzy Bone (Tupac) 
 Well look at the thug that my momma gave up on and labeled me worthless/ Stroll through the city at 14 dirtless, put in my work and alert the service (Tell 'em) Who could have knew it/ Lil' Pac will give and regain in the world (Whoa) with enemies all rollin' (Freeze nigga) Ruthless, well I better pull my pistol and pearl/ Before they analyze my bail been treated psychologically since 12 or whatever/ Can I get bail? Or will I motherfuck myself? Well I'm off to The Land with a hand full of balls that's all/ Just some of my dogs Mo! Thuggin' thuggin'/ Ready to maul on y'all with a forty-five/ Y'all fall and don't you call them laws/ Remember my name and that's not all/ Whenever you want some call and I'll be prepared to haul y'all off/ Nigga dash trap that ass roll up your up yo' ass and punch it then flash/ Got a gauge, when I catch 'em chillin' let's go kill his ass, kill his ass, kill his ass 
 Tupac 
 Ha ha ha what's poppin' nigga? (Yeah) Put your motherfuckin' hand on your strap nigga (Thug Luv nigga) Hell yeah, we can do this like gangstas and slug it out (Thug Luv) Or we can do this like punks and punk it out. Pull your strap on me (Thug Luv) Nigga and you better kill me. Thug Life baby. (Thug Luv) 
 I'll probably be punished for hard livin' blind to the facts/ Thugs is convicts in Gods' prison, hands on the strap/ I'm praying, so Father please forgive me/ Police be rushing when they see me I flaunted America's Most Wanted, live on TV like pleasure and pain, stuck in this game, holler my name/ We all gon' die, we bleed through similar veins/ Please explain to me now, don't panic when my guns burst/ You heard the last jam nigga, this one's worse/ My nigga Bone held the chrome till I came home/ Thug Luv playa/ Tell these bitch niggas, bring it on/ I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evenin' to help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathing/ Now, who you believe in? Hit the weed and breathe it's a cold ass the world, niggas kill you in your sleep, watch me/ Until they stop me, bury, murder me, or drop me I got Thug Luv for my nationwide posse, feel me 
 Sylk E. Fyne 
 A bitch like Sylk-E catch ya slippin' soon as you forget and trippin'/ South Central stompin' motherfuckers bloodin' and crippin' lil' ripstress/ So let me kick it, I'm tired of hearin' that fake shit/ I roll with real bitches, thugstas, and pimps/ Got to repent, heaven sent since I was a small girl/ Asked The Lord to save my soul from this cold ass world/ Life unfolds, I unload to keep my sanity/ I guess it's just the B.I.T.C.H. in me 
 Bizzy Bone 
 Armageddon! Lord knows that I won't fly by that lesson/ Who taught me to pull out my wesson? You brought me and I'm not stressin' it softly/ Get 'em up off me cause all we wanted was harmony/ Been bombing 'em, yell up outta my ghettos I won't settle, get on my level/ They can't stop me or drop me/ Nigga they got me? Fuck no! Little Pac get schizophrenic, it's manage to damage all y'all (and oh...) I'll talk about 'em and you don't really want it 'cause they're cornered and I want 'em to jump up/ I'd rather say that we came to shut 'em all down and so quick to test/ Bullet? Yes, declare war/ Roll and I'll blow when I get the gun for the murder mo' horror for what the did it all pause for the cause and I fin to pull a nine or pistol whip a little nigga wit mine/ Fuckin' niggas, it's on/ All y'all fall/ Bizzy gettin' bitches, test me, bless the floor/ In any attempt to arrest me, stress me, Lord/ Lookin' at death with the last of my breath/ Follow, follow my kids, but don't sin in my steps/ Yet the weapon is kept with the best of my secrets/ Deep in the leaves I'm alone, nigga believe it/ That I can see it if needed an if you really want me in/ Well let it be and get the greens and be runnin' up over Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland...
