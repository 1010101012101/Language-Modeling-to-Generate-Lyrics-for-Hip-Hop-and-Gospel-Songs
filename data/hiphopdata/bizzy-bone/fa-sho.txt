Bizzy Bone-Intro- 
 Ya, lets have some fun with him. Who's song is that? (Y'all know what your talking about?) (Ya, uh) Mob Life. Little Bizzy Bone, Bone Thugs 'n' Harmony. Yes, 7th Sign (I'm out). In full effect baby. (Count off) 
 -Bizzy Bone-(Chick)-Chorus- 
 One for the money/ Two for the show, Oh no! (Do you wanna ride for sho'?)/ And thanks to the rhythm you know I'm gangsta ghetto (Ghetto), do you fo sho? (Do you wanna ride for sho')/ One for the money/ Two for the show, Oh no! (Do you wanna ride for sho'?)/ And thanks to the rhythm you know I'm gangsta ghetto (Ghetto), do you fo sho? (Do you wanna ride for sho') 
 -Bizzy Bone- 
 Havin' a party god damn/ Its another ghetto bash, its fast comin' to bring 'em right at ya/ Lives to the grapevines/ Business type, nobody can break us/ Got a little Italian in me, but I'm not paper chasin/ Gimme money like basketball players, and richer than Casey Layons with the heat, seeks the street damn my dead friends/ I hope that he said his prayers before he met his end, broke bread/ Make a mends with your maker, I love my creator/ I never been a hater, my baby momma stole all my Gators/ My face keep craters, but dog for real we still down/ You know that block keeps me still/ You got the scrilla, I got the scrilla/ You know the deal, if its on than its on/ Flip the blunt, we go peel/ To the family, polish up the Grammy and chill/ What do you know, Papi Chullo got a record deal (Record deal) 
 -Court Dog- 
 Midwest representers, write that down, never go home/ We gettin' the money, I'm makin' the bids, we lay 'em down, so ruff so tuff/ We hittin' them corners and hittin them blocks and buy me some 25's/ None of you haters in case you ain't know its Court Dogg with 7th Sign/ 7th Sign soldiers, you hatin'? It ain't kosher/ You roll or get rolled over/ Layin' in that black trunk with a chaffer/ We criminals tryna be rapper, smash 'em (Yes we is)/ So the question we gotta be askin' 'So would you wanna be holdin' your pants? Get my parlayed, thug passion' We leave the ladies grinnin from ear to ear/ With the back stretched from here to here/ Heres some playas, its pretty its pretty/ Its pretty clear, you dig?/ We leave them clearances/ You really wanna compare (?)/ What you think this is? The D Boy, 7th Sign choppin' trees, timber! And Court Dog, the long lost Bone, nigga/ Braids blowin' in the wind/ Got nothin' but money to spend, sippin' Henn/ Runnin' it and let this free wheel spin 
 -Chick- 
 Its Court Dogg and Mob Life/ And Bizzy Bone and 7th Sign (Gotta get up)/ Its Court Dogg and Mob Life/ And Bizzy Bone and 7th Sign (Gotta get up) 
 -Court Dog- 
 Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, Court Dog' buyin' drinks for everybody/ I only kick with realist, guerillas, and dealers, can't fade the wannabe haters and sqealers/ I'm breakin' the figures and givin' it in, and time to deliver these heavy hitters; Bone Thugs N Harmony, you with us/ 2 Sic you D Boy, you know they feel us/ The haters, they want me to stop but see, I can't/ When saw all my game, I told 'em me name and I'm laughin' all the way to the bank (Ha ha) and you know it's fa' sho'
