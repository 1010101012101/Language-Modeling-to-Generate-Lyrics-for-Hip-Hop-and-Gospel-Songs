 Gangsta music (sic sic sic sic); 
 Buck buck! 
 I guess my mother had a bad Bone, 
 See back in the days she left all her little kids but now a days she be like mad home; 
 They told me to make a statement, I'm'a make this blatant, 
 People act like they Jesus, and others play the game for Satan; 
 This is the end of time, 
 And I'm the only lil' nigga in this mothafucka, Noah style, catch my line?; 
 106 Don't like my music, 
 But I got fans overseas tellin' me "B.B. come through and let the states lose ya"; 
 Yeah, Yeah, BUCK BUCK! 
 Y'all can't stop it, y'all can't stop, 
 Gangsta music (sic sic sic sic sic); 
 Y'all can't stop it, y'all can't stop, 
 Gangsta music (sic sic sic sic); 
 Buck buck! 
 Ibuprofen, eight hundred, I get along with Russel Simmons, 
 And Leon Cohen, drip, my different fam flowin'; 
 Michael can change his nose, Michael can change his clothes, 
 The only thing I take off Michael was those panty hose; 
 Everyone think I'm crazy, everyone think I'm drunk, 
 I told the world I was molested and they called me 'punk'; 
 No compassion or passion, my khaki suit be mashin', 
 But then a nigga come with some tight jeans and they call it fashion; 
 Rappers don't battle me, I'll call 'em all out, 
 Ain't nobody said a word, Bizzy Bone, no doubt; 
 The voice is just stupendous, his fan base is tremendous, 
 So I decided to give you all of me on Heaven's canvas; 
 Painstakin' then child birth, 
 I tried my voice on auto tune, they said it just ain't work, my voice just too twerk; 
 I'm from the middle of the Universe, I should be Captain Kirk, 
 Mothafucka I earned it, and plus I put in my work. 
 Yeah, Yeah, BUCK BUCK! 
 Y'all can't stop it, y'all can't stop,

 Y'all can't stop it, y'all can't stop, 
 Gangsta music (sic sic sic sic);

 Can't stop my gangsta music, I keeps this gangsta anthem, 
 Look at the blimp, like a pimp, oh Tony Montana; 
 I'm numba one amongst my greatest with my country grammar, 
 Twenty records, still goin', I persevered through cancer; 
 I hear that 106 don't like my music, 
 But I got fans overseas tellin' me "B.B., let them states lose ya"; 
 I do my shows, y'all some lyin' hoes, 
 I'm never sued because the promoters ain't do what they was supposed to, oh!; 
 Wendy Williams, you need to kill the noise, 
 You made your name up off of gossip, and laughed 'cause I was touched as a boy; 
 Get on my nerves, like you the next Oprah, 
 I put it on Tyra banks, you look straight up like a drag queen mixed up with a gopher; 
 I'll never forget what you said about Pac, I'll never forget what you said about Big, 
 I'll never forget, and I never forgot, I never forgot...; 
 But you commentate like you got the scoop, bitch you like 70 years old, 
 Listen here, Grandma, you was Geritol when Melle Mel was cold, Bitch. 
 Y'all can't stop it, y'all can't stop, 
 Gangsta music (sic sic sic sic sic); 
 Y'all can't stop it, y'all can't stop, 
 Gangsta music (sic sic sic sic); 
 Buck buck!
