Yeah, hahaha, yeah tell them what time it is 
 Bone Bone Bone Bone and Bizzy Bone Bone Bone Bone Bone Bone Bone 
 They try ta bang in tha club but they doin' it wrong (It Wrong) 
 They try ta get gangsta with it but they just don't know (Don't Know) 
 They try ta get ? all night but that shit ain't raw (Ain't raw) 
 Let's play a little ? with bizzy bone, and his head gunna blow (Blow) 
 We got 'em mad at us but these bitches they should be glad for us 
 When I'm up in tha forest with goldylock eatin their pourage 
 Rockin' that funky john, drinkin' villa maria, ? my momma mia 
 It's so many people in tha world and within tha plantet 
 Take it for granted and they lost up in their circle dammit 
 One chance for a conditional love and its real 
 I ain't poppin' no pills, I'm just clockin them? 
 Walkin' in and eat and as we pass? 
 Tell them my name is brian, yes my name is? 
 Do you believe, but it's all real good 'cause we got guard 
 ? As I get on my job 
 Still rockin' and yes we solid as a? 
 Passin that sticky icky ta bizzy? 
 ? In tha name of tha father ta tha son and tha holy spirit 
 The beginning of wisdom is the? 
 They try ta bang in tha club but they doin' it wrong (It Wrong) 
 They try ta get gangsta with it but they just don't know (Don't Know) 
 They try ta get ? all night but that shit ain't raw (Ain't raw) 
 Let's play a little ? with bizzy bone, and his head gunna blow (Blow) 
 If they had a pagent for hustlas id be rapped in tha rhythm 
 Ya can't pull my ? street capitolism 
 ? Turn me to rap for maximum livin' 
 Come on mommy do something on my lap to tha rhythm 
 I'm a suitcase exchanger, transaction arranger, 
 Forklift breakin these crates are gettin' heavier 
 I don't got ta touch ya to see or do my thing ta ya, 
 Knowin' mah status alone will shake ya labia (Play a little game) 
 They know I'm known ta make tha beats smash 
 You keep bounchin like that, and you gunna get a beat rash 
 Cocaine white, suit on, on and ? match, plus my keys match, see I don't need this 
 You with me now, this byfar is a blessin, 
 When we get to tha car you should start undressin' me (Undressin' me) 
 The way you've been waitin for some one impressin' 
 And I'm right behind ya, check one two testin' 
 They try ta bang in tha club but they doin' it wrong (It Wrong) 
 They try ta get gangsta with it but they just don't know (Don't Know) 
 They try ta get ? all night but that shit ain't raw (Ain't raw) 
 Let's play a little ? with bizzy bone, and his head gunna blow (Blow) 
 When they lookin' ? at us, what's wrong they should be glad for us 
 When I'm walkin' in tha forest, gotta go a long way, like in tha chorus 
 ? For us, smokin' tha ?, and tha pictures clearer, one guard, always superior 
 Feelin' us, one time we in tha stoodi oodi, gettin' it groovy 70's style like moody oodi 
 Roll with a uzi, never even had to use it, make my money, smokin' weed and drinkin' liquor 
 Singin' music (Hey) 
 Never abuse it, the concenquences are serious, 
 Just like my homie in colombus its mysterious 
 Curiousity, its commin' in so feroucious 
 Expialliedocus, deeper, its pycholis (Why) 
 Still rockin' and we solid as a? 
 Passin that sticky icky ta bizzy? 
 ? In tha name of tha father ta tha son and tha holy spirit 
 The beginning of wisdom is the? 
 They try ta bang in tha club but they doin' it wrong (It Wrong) 
 They try ta get gangsta with it but they just don't know (Don't Know) 
 They try ta get ? all night but that shit ain't raw (Ain't raw) 
 Let's play a little ? with bizzy bone, and his head gunna blow (Blow) 
 Bone (Till End)
