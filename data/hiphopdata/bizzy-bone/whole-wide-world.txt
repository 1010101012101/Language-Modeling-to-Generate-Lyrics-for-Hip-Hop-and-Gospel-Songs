This is for... 
 The whole wide world, 
 The whole wide world, the whole wide world, the whole wide world 
 And your neighborhood, and your neighborhood, and your neighborhood, 
 And your neighbor hood 
 Thank God for the love 
 Cause a nigga was up in the club lookin' down on nigga rat scum 
 Don't wait a single black daddy 
 With six litttle babies and one hell of a job 
 Mob in and out cities why is these niggas mad at me? 
 They say I'm pretty and he don't want his daughter to see 
 I'm Lil Bizzy thank god for my destiny 
 I love ya momma ain't no drama in a breath of me 
 I barely made it I was runnin' around faded gunnin the town up 
 Comin' around the corner Jesus I found ya 
 Dead bodies, my sister stilll wanna party 
 Nobody can stop me, nobody can stop me 
 You want everything you want stop searchin for your solemate 
 Cause you got cha one lets take it easy help him with the homework 
 Dicipline y'all don't need the yellin' 
 I met hear at a party ready to fuck 
 And I ain't give a fuck 'cause she in another nigga truck 
 You can have that bitch back as soon as I finish I'm fourteen 
 So I nigga kinda get it 
 She's a motherfuckin slut the real whatta you know? 
 I fell in love the real was I fell in lust 
 Young and dumb and full of cum 
 Bitch can I fill it up? damn got a baby in nine months 
 We was on the getup I was at home cleanin they shit up 
 Been up since three o'clock in the mornin (the fuck you want!?) 
 You got a nigga with your fake ass 
 Now you wanna call me for a bus pass? 
 Fuck that keep walkin' walkin' 
 Always talkin' make shit nothin' and that shit gone kill ya 
 Betta take caution bitch I'm still that killa, killa, killa, killa 
 (Chorus Repeat Until Fade)
