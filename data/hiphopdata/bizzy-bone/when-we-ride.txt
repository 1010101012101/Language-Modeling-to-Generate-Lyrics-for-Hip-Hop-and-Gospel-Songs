When we ride, I'll tell you who I'm rollin' with 
 All day, all night, that's right 
 When we ride, I tell you who I'm rollin' with 
 We ride, we ride, we ride 
 (Bizzy) 
 You know, see me and the homie 
 Tellin' you jump on up in the ride 
 A bottle of wine, you lettin my prophesize 
 And I'm, feelin' your vibe 
 I'm feelin' to try to stop in Cleveland 
 With Bone Thugs, that's my family 
 The reason for the season, and don't leave em 
 Cause that's my family 
 (Mr. Criminal) 
 In the H-B-G is my family 
 We about to blow up, you just wait and see 
 Patiently, I been waitin, G 
 Hop in the lowrider, come escape with me 
 In 63 Cleve Chevrolet Classic 
 Rollin' down the boulevard, flossin in the masses 
 Eyes bloodshot, so I'm rollin' with my glasses 
 From the West Coast where we turn it into ashes 
 (Bizzy) 
 Everybody on the west side, my papito 
 Mamacita in the barrio 
 Tequila, my amigo 
 Never disrespect you 
 You know I respect you, that's for sure 
 In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit 
 Praise the Lord 
 Now let us ride... 
 When we ride, I'll tell you who I'm rollin' with 
 All day, all night, that's right 
 When we ride, I tell you who I'm rollin' with 
 We ride, we ride, we ride 
 (Mr. Criminal) 
 Since we come and we gone 
 Checkin' hits from the Bone 
 Hit to stick to your zone 
 You better leave it alone 
 Doin' shows just to stay, and I'm finally back home 
 Hooked up with the homeboy Bizzy from Bone 
 And we finally clicked up and we doin' them things 
 Bone Thug, Hi Power, stay true to the game 
 Givin' one another uncut heat in the bay 
 Bizzy Bone, Mr. Criminal spittin' the flame 
 Stay smokin' the J, and I'm feelin' the vibe 
 Turn it up when you downtown, rollin' your ride 
 Windows up, hot box and I'm feelin' the vibe 
 Pass it to the homie Bizzy, watch him rip it with time 
 (Bizzy) 
 Little Bizzy the kid, you better know what it is 
 I get ahold of your kids, you better put in your bids 
 You better put in your dibs, and now we're lookin' at the criminal kids 
 I gotta feelin' that they're willin' 
 Sinnin is dangerous, and dangerous 
 Better get with the program, and slow jam 
 Feelin' that shit, feelin' that shit 
 Pullin that wheel, feelin' that shit 
 Come from another perspective 
 Recelective with a past, we missed it 
 My family, I'm left out, aw ma, damn me 
 But I got God 
 Tellin' 'em better get 'em but I'm comin' tryin' to get 'em got a feelin' when a mother on a mission better listen 
 That's the way 
 And that's the way we play 
 And it all go grab your four-four 
 Better go kill em, criminal get em 
 One big fam, bam 
 My man, you know that you got to feel em 
 When we ride, I'll tell you who I'm rollin' with 
 All day, all night, that's right 
 When we ride, I tell you who I'm rollin' with 
 We ride, we ride, we ride 
 (Bizzy) 
 Put them hands in the air like this, like this 
 And put your finger in the air like that, like that 
 Yeah... everybody on the West Side 
 Everybody on the West Side 
 Put your finger in the air and wave it like you don't care 
 And wave it like you don't care 
 Put your finger in the air and wave it like you don't care 
 The homie Bizzy Bone 
 And the homie Mr. Criminal 
 When we ride
