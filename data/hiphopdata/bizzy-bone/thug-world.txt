Yeah 
 The world ain't yours Thug world 
 Better prepare for war 
 Better prepare for war 
 Hey thug world the world ain't yours 
 Thug world 
 These last days you better prepare for war 
 You better prepare for war 
 Better prepare 
 Better be ready for whatever 
 Lil' B still be getting scarredy in the eleventh in the ghetto 
 Down in Columbus off the thuggish ruggish mash on the pedal 
 Throwing up the sevens on these player haters 
 Blast the bessel 
 Furthermore been popping over crude oil 
 Off in the ghetto we don't know nothing about it 
 'Cause half of these brothers can't be loyal 
 Picture me sipping on Hennessey 
 Remember me 
 Caught up inside the twenty third century 
 Giving the best of me 
 Evidently this is real 
 Putting it on Baby Phil 
 Let's do this video grime 
 Quick 'fore I get killed 
 This is a battlefield 
 This how it's going down 
 And we be twisting they tongue soon as I come around 
 Better watch your back 
 And don't be scared youngsta 
 This is the gangsta party 
 And who me? 
 Bizzy the thugsta 
 Call me Kamikaze 
 I won't even speak about illuminati 
 Welcome to Babylon 
 Man (hey) I need to speak to Tommy 
 Gotta get to drinking 
 Me thinking 
 She finna fin in the car 
 Karlos Shemar Davis, Tupac and Biggie Smalls 
 Eric Wright one of the 'fore fathers of gangsta shhhhh 
 He one of the ones that got me in 
 Y'all know what it is 
 One time for Left-Eye 
 Put your hands up 
 My little daughter Illiya 
 Making me man up 
 Oh Illiya I think I'm falling down the steps 
 By the millions 
 That's the way I feeling (hey) 
 What about Bone Thugs 
 If you really want to know 
 Gotta keep it moving, keep it going 
 'Cause I ain't no Ho! 
 Cocked in the streets with them 
 Busting jack-move 
 This game is all about bidness 
 Now let this track prove 
 Slap box with the biggest brother 
 And make the big boy fall for your mother ruckus 
 My foster brother got shot in one of his eyes (pow!) 
 I guess Jehovah ain't want trackie to die 
 Come on! 
 How dumb would I be if I started a fight over you just because women didn't swallow you 
 How dumb would I be if I hit you with bottles and niggas beginning to storm you 
 I been in the shroud in columbus pow 
 But I can smile now Thug World 
 Drunk and I'm buck wild 
 And if you young better enjoy the chow feeling me now 
 I come in the dog hood ready and proud 
 What the world say? 
 Hey y'all never bow down 
 Keep on keeping on 
 (He laughs) 
 Pretty boy with the blemish 
 All coke and crown 
 My seventh sign niggas wit' me 
 I could smoke a pound 
 Gotta get mine 'cause I ain't finished 
 Had the ghetto in me 
 Since elementary 
 I been rapping 
 And staying Bizzy 
 A couple of sissies 
 In the long run 
 Gimme some 
 Let's make this conversation deep 
 And we ain't saying nothing 
 Welcome to Babylon 
 We in the universe 
 You know my name dawg 
 They call me Bizzy y'all
