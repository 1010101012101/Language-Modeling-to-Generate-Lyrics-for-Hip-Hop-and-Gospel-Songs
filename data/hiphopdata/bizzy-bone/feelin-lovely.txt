Yeah, it's going down... 7th sign film slash records in full motherfucking effect (yes sir) please believe it nigga, bizzy the kid, midwest cowboy 
 Sippin muggle, feelin' lovely, dizzy smokin' sticky icky, in every city my ni***s rollin' wit me, strapped up on me, yaheard I got kicked out of bone thugs 'n' harmony? what you thinkin', I'm a soldier, survive, the ugly, don't come around me if you whiskin 4 money I ain't got it, u know I just got out of the jail? (what?) they put 2gether my bail and I'm still runnin' from the popo, ridin' wit the top down, top down, purple haze, makin' my shift, hittin snitches and let the six four drop down, drop down, jealous ni***s callin me a son of a whooOO! 
 And I be runnin' from the police, all week, 
 We bin drinkin' and smokin' rollin' them swisher sweets, 
 When we get up in the club they tell us 2 leave, 
 Its something about liqour make u c enemies (who is that?) [Wrong I think..] 
 My body luv drinking hennesy, 
 Adrenalin pumpin I'm thuggish ruggish with energy, 
 Heaven is where we wanna be! and money is what we wanna see! 
 I got them bullets that'll move ya body, body! 
 Put 'em in a gangster like hasta~la~vista, 
 I'm ghetto like [gostos for mostas [or something..]] 
 Its time for the four, hail ceaser, 
 Walk through here with the gasoline jacket, snatchin the reefer, 
 Gotta go, go, fresh out of the county, steady as we grow, 
 All of my ni***s is dead... and I'm bein questioned by the feds 
 Let me know what they said, enemies sleepin' in my bed, 
 This was written by my bishop wit this vision in my head, 
 Hey, let me c u left marsh, do it for death charge, 
 I can feel the vision wit my company in red, 
 Let me know what they said, 'cause they fake like they my friends 
 It's the jealousy in them, and the zealousness in them, 
 And you can tell 'em once again, i, my people winnin', 
 U can choke and it [??] seemless sprees is spinnin, 
 Got this skeez blending breeze, I make a week at the knees, 
 I mean literally, I make a week at the knees! 
 >>Chorus 2 times<<
