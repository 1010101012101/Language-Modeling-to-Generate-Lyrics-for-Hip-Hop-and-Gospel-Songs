 All right lets hear that shit you been playin' with 
 (The fortunate one uses the instrument of (?) meditation) 
 (Philosophical gangsta) 
 (Don't be talking about no drugs and no prophecies? around here) 
 (And don't listen to that street talk, cause that street talk is dead) 
 (Philosophical gangsta) 
 Walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
 Flesh and blood, evil keep questionin us 
 We bust, lay back in the cut 
 Sinister (minds they blind us?) soon as you find it toss your diamonds 
 Nibble that tree of science he thinks he's laughin' at Bryon 
 He don't know that he gone keep on tryin' 
 Whatever he thinks that he's telling her won't be no buyin from earth 
 That planet Orion from birth 
 I'm twisting the stomach from hella spices like cayenne 
 Hit 'em with trifectors the fruit of that nectar's dyin' 
 I am what I am changed switch it up like Outkast 
 Everyone thought that Andre was crazy now he gets the bypass 
 Time trickle like hourglass, who ready to ride 
 (Buh) quit snitchin I know that it's cold outside 
 Whether with gold or not, better know we bold outside 
 I'd rather not take a bath, and feelin' all dirty inside 
 But its pretty inside, look at all the girlies inside 
 So what, we hearin the mission but that mission ain't mine 
 For all the wicked wisdom they find and they blind 
 (Better act cruel one of the mat????) 
 Walk the streets look for the rabbi 
 While sippin on a mai tai 
 Talk to religious figures while lookin' down at the skyline 
 Worship no graven images bye bye 
 (God go where he wanna go?) 
 Let you know what he want you to know 
 You know how its wrote- your heart, your mind, your soul 
 Walkin' through the scriptures where all of the saints preceded that 
 I'm weeded up, but of course the people don't believe in that 
 Leadin back, demons in my dreamin' holdin' my semen back 
 Salty like Saddam watchin Amora, check the almanac 
 Never had no friends and if I did then they left 
 They so scared, for who to be crucified, still gone lose your breath 
 Now get up get out since they got doubt 
 You thought that I would let you get away without exposin your smell 
 There ain't nothing you can do and there ain't nothing you can say (3x) 
 Break bread and throw the bread in your face 
 You better believe 
 (Philosophical gangsta) 
 (Don't be talking about no drugs and no prophecies?? around here) 
 There ain't no comin' back from a Bizzy Bone 
 You better believe 
 (And don't listen to that street talk, cause that street talk is dead) 
 (Philosophical gangsta) 
 (You aren't afraid are you?) 
 (NO! No no no) 
 (Philosophical gangsta)
