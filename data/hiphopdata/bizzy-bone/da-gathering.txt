 Now comin' through with all of my sins/ When it comin' makin' these ends, up in this industry/ Niggas from all across the seas as real as it is/G's, hoe's be ridin' wit me/ Subconscisly cause my enemies love me/ When even I'm asleep still/ Waken up to this reality/ I've seen many more casualities/ It wouldn't suit me though didn't wanna see the man/ Cold hard the wheels/ Hold the funeral/ They shouldn't of did it, damn no shouldn't of done it/ That's why they all gettin' punished/ Puttin' 'em in the hood/ Now I'm runnin' through the hood land/ When I exit the highway, steadily (?) / To the say mo, give that to my people/ We get up in y'all, wanna act a fool?, cruel jumpin' off like Crenshaw/ Movin on up to the Brinkser Projects to represent where I sent y'all/ Money meant y'all shouldn't live in the past, chance/ In the eyes of Satan, we await/ Ima never forget where I came from/ Please never forget where we came from

My money hit the floor niggas get that paper but nigga's can't get it/ Mysterious, curious look up at the moon and my nigga's losin'/ I had that hard boy luck/ Just hope I don't get shot/ Oh what my luck/ Show them it's on the floor but what if the tempo be to (?) shoot him with the automatic bullets, it's a wonderful d
