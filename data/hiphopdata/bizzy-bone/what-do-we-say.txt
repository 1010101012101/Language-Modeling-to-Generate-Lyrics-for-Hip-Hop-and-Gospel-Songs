Hey, What do we say (say, say) 
 Creepin' on ah come up Baby 
 This is the way that we play 
 I Try to warn ya everyday (day, day) 
 In the belly in the brain 
 In the belly in the womb 
 While we walkin' in the water 
 Poppa I'm a keep it movin 
 Doin' everything I gotta keep it 
 God of all the heavens and earth 
 Heavenly Father father 
 Well it's the baby and I'm tuning in again 
 How are you doin' my friend? 
 Baby I'm feelin' I'm doin' so fine 
 Sippin' that ghetto wine 
 Watchin the world spin 
 I'm a get you there 
 Room enough for you to go anywhere 
 That you wanna 
 Hit them corners 
 Get that money 
 Stay off the streets 
 I needa warn ya 
 That the shit get hectic 
 Searches for purses 
 Curses, feelin' like you worthless 
 Time to reveal the real 
 You know what it is 
 But baby I do miss my kids 
 Shit, feelin' get it right for you 
 Day one, two, three, you feelin' me troops 
 And do whatcha gotta do let me flip that matrix 
 Beat that hatred 
 Playa you can say it 
 While I'm walkin' in Eden, 
 Seemingl, illustrate 
 Wanna kick back 
 You don't wanna play with' it 
 Tell a nizzle that we play with' it 
 Move when I move 
 Do what ya gotta do 
 Watch that shit, no, gotta move dude, 
 Good vibrations, skip that mansion 
 Look at that bullshit, still tryna trance 'em, 
 Yeah nigga romance 'em 
 And lighten a lantern 
 Duck that green 
 Unless it's patches 
 The rapper Bizzy Bone sees 
 Bryon McCane, he sees 
 Fathom 
 No mathematic, automatic, 
 Duckin the physical let me 
 Touch the rhythm so unhypicritical, 
 Stay little, stay brittle, that's bitter 
 I'm with ya, I'm with ya, I'm with ya. 
 Everything 
 Forever for the love of Christ 
 He paid the price (price) 
 Murdered him twice 
 Or shake dem dice 
 Bryon McCane is the name my mayne 
 Brother we are the same it's plain 
 Rationalise 
 Snapped them thoughts for me 
 Ruff for me, all for me 
 God is the greatest 
 Reign, stars and the quest for the righteous steps 
 Complete one let's never forget 
 So hard no disregard 
 Callin on the road when I stand in the yard 
 I am not no double agent because God can split soul and spirit 
 Sodomnly speak to me 
 Abraham plan for the man keys 
 Speakin' to me speakin' to me speakin' to me (gimme gimme gimme) 
 I can hear you clearly 
 Here's a tear for me 
 In the here with B. 
 Like a grain of sand 
 They say the day would be 
 They're not feelin' me man (feelin' me man) 
 Devil damn 
 We're runnin' in a valley already 
 Steady as we go 
 Drop that chevy 
 Steady as we go 
 Drop that chevy 
 Heavily the melody the felony and I plead the fifth 
 I plead the one I plead the gift 
 Shifted and lifted you feel that shit 
 Put the skully walk to we heal that shit 
 I plead the one I plead the gift 
 Shifted and lifted you feel that shit 
 You put your skully on, walk 
 We gon' heal that shit heal that shit feel that shit.
