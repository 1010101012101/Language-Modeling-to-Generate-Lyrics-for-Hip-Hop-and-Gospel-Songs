Bizzy Fo' Sho' 
 -Chorus-Bizzy- 
 While I'm walkin' in the cold... 
 (Yeah... Where my killas at? Realer...) 
 And you know I just seen the widow it's hot as hell dayla we-we 
 All about B-I-Z 
 Can I get a case? I need a genie to incarcerate me 
 Run with a chain gang, police incarcerate me 
 Bizzy 
 Po-po act like they ain't ghetto too 
 Judges don't love me, bitches ain't be nothin' 
 They be fuckin' one of my homeboys; I've done the same thang 
 Thuggish niggas survive and broke down buckets 
 Remember? Shut up! I need a new bitch 
 What up? I need a true bitch 
 Said 'Alice get out my Lexus', 
 She done taked my pistol case and fucked another nigga 
 To claim she was raped 
 But I had 'em skitsofrenic with my bone tape; y'all damaged 
 I wouldn't put my handcuffs on you but if you cheap you gon' break 
 This my flip-flop flow and I'm with Hip Hop; 
 Let you know (Did you know?) 
 I want some mo' I want some mo'(C'mon serve me) 
 Hungry baby? We thirsty! We open Sunday; 
 Sunset to sunrise and ride out on Monday 
 One day I'll have a fun day; Got to make that money man 
 (Fo' Sho') Got to get my swerve on 
 They' homie want to verge all; 
 You heard me, heard me, heard me? 
 (You know what I'm sayin'?) and dirty money 
 Show me in secret, don't tell 'em, sell 'em in daylight 
 Come in parallel position myself and artillery, stealth, healthy 
 Let's hit 'em, get away Where my killas at, at? 
 They platinum plus likin' them broads in the black bag 
 Back me up baby (What?) {laughs} 
 -Chorus-Bizzy- 
 (While I was walkin' in the cold. While I was walkin' in the cold. yeah yeah yeah)
