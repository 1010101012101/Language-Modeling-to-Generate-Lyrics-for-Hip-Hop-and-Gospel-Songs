 Gimme an ounce for 350, nigga need a quick divorce/ My niggas keep tellin' me what they keep sayin' about B in the Source/ But I don't read magazines, nigga that's just irratation/ Bizzy reads the type of books to further along his education/ Little do they know about what-what-what/ Little do they know about who-who-who/ Little do they know about me-me-me/ Get these and tell about you-you-you/ Ain't no time to be trippin' on women cause women will have you get caught up and shot/ Lil' niggas them bitches is yours so slap on tha rubber or beat up the cock/ Lil' niggas y'all so horny/ Only got yo' car for broads/ How could I be hatin' when y'all are the fakest niggas I've ever saw/ Y'all rollin' with snitches, I don't know no snitches/ I roll with real niggas till they fall off, God pick 'em up for they loose they britches/ And I feel my children love me, Daddy gotsta do mo' better/ By the time we makin' money and spendin' my time with 'em, with 'em, with 'em, stuck up in the middle/ Play me like fiddle, filthy like everyday, don't be fickle motherfuckers

 Would it be better if we could just choose the future, blood mixed up, call me fuchsia/ Thug picked up by the people; No Ruthless, no medusa/ See I got jacked in Beverly Hills, still I keeps it real, very selective, wanna just smoke and chill/ See I'm a veteran, all the grenade launchers wont cost me much/ Anyone could get extorts/ Yeah nigga, you can be touched/ I did all my dirt in the 'burbs/ I was ridin' around with my sisters' babies father/ Double barrel shot-gun say word/ Ready or not here come my words, steady or not, that shit's absurd/ Already got, me all perturbed/ Cop on tha block, gettin' on my nerves/ This is the lifestyle of that brick sellin' been falsified/ Niggas don't let 'em lie to y'all, I'm a tell the truth on mine/ And I really want no more/ Catch yo' ass security wires/ Open the door, these rappers is scared as hell/ What you frontin' for? He got his entourage, and he got his bag of weed, is this the way it is? Little Bizzy takes the lead

 Whateva, whateva, we gotta get cheddar; I'm better with money/ Been runnin' around, with a gun and a skully/ And one on my buddy's now dippin' tha swisha/ And then again hmm../ Nobody's the best, and ya betta believe it, then leave it alone, lone/ I'm a tell y'all, all my secrets/ Son of a mistress, carry on outta tha foster home, been raised outta my freaky ways/ Burn my collection of porn, but I don't won't no straights/ What about church folks stressin' that I should change/ Live ya life, I'm a live my life without the lies and let me pray for change/ Now keep the pimp cup, I don't wanna blow the pimps up/ Cause my father's father was pimpin' and he left all of his children checkin' (Fucker!) I don't have to respect it and you don't have to respect it/ Gimmie my space, and I'm a give you yours/ It's my profession, nigga (Nigga!) It ain't a game, y'all can pop tha collar, uh/ It'll be some drama in tha parkin lot/ 7th sign poppin' ya column/ One for the money, hollar/ Two for the D, playas/ It's the way we play and police nigga y'all can swallow
