Uh, yo... 
 I feel trapped, my backs against the wall 
 I sold crack, I made stacks, but I'm destined to fall 
 Anyway y'all, the jail cell ain't no place for me 
 Anyway its overcrowded ain't no space for me 
 Court date no way, that's what they hope to see 
 Can you believe they told me wasn't no hope for me? 
 That the only thing out here was dope for me? 
 You might as well got a tree and a rope for me, I'm hangin' 
 And I got so much hate inside 
 I done seen so much wrong dawg my fate done died 
 But couldn't let these motherf**ckers take my pride 
 Yeah I was hurtin' but you never seen no tears in my eyes 
 And every time I'm in these streets my fuckin' mom was cryin 
 Cause of you, inside, my f**ckin mom was dyin' 
 You put crack on these streets, n**gas brains is fryin 
 I'm sick of your **it I'm sick of your liein 
 Sick of hearin 'bout a war on drugs to stop crack 
 Nothin' but a war on the thug to lock up a black 
 We don't own no boats no planes no trains none of that 
 You brought it over here so mother fucker send it back 
 And you travel space other planets lookin' for martians 
 Kids in your own fuckin' cities is starvin 
 Sendin money to feed people in the third world countries 
 Motherf**cker sleepin' on the street dirty and hungry 
 Can't believe the shit you do, know you wrong 
 You the reason why she dropped out now she dance in a thong 
 You the reason why I spit with so much hate in this song 
 My 1st ammendmants free speech and bitch I know I ain't wrong 
 You the reason whya n*gga suffer from paranoia 
 'Cause you they judge, your motherfuckin brother they lawer 
 You runnin' for office in one state (?) 
 And your brothers the governor, coincidence? naw... 
 You call yourself the land of the free, home of the brave 
 This shit belong to me bitch my people were slaves 
 Fuck forty acres in the mule now, I gotta tool now 
 And I'm just waitin for one of you bitches to move now 
 Thought hed cool down, always da fire, and I'm the fuel now 
 Lets see how many people shoot up they schools now 
 I'm the n**ga they hate to see, that's why these bitches can't stand face to face wit me 
 Dawg rap my dawg smoke weed and sell crack 
 Well you gave this shit to me now I'm just givin' it back 
 But its funny I'm gettin' money they can't deal with that 
 But I'm the truth in the booth I'm just spittin' the facts 
 F**ck America dawg... f**ck America dawg... 
 F**ck America dawg... f**ck America dawg... yeah... f**ck America dawg... 
 F**ck America dawg...
