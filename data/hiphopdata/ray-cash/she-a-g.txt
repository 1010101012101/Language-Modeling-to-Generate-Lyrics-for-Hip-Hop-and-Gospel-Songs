(Gladys Knight) 
 Are you gonna be 
 Say that you're gonna be 
 Jaime Foxx: 
 Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh... 
 (Chorus: J.Foxx) 
 She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross, a little Anita, will definitely set this party off right 
 (Are you gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, well well, well well) 
 She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition, some Minnie Ripperton, will definitely set this party off right 
 (Are you gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be, well well well well) 
 Kanye West: 
 I told her to drop over in your new whip, 
 Bring some friends you cool with, 
 Imma bring da cool whip, 
 Then I want you to strip, 
 See you is my new chick, 
 So we get our grind on, 
 She be grabbin, callin me Biggie like Shyne home, 
 Man I swear she fine homes, 
 Why she always lying though, 
 Tellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones, 
 She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson, 
 Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson, 
 I played 'Ready for the World' - she was ready for some action, 
 My dawg said you ain't no freak, so you 'bout to prove my man wrong, 
 Imma play this Vandross, 
 You gon' take your pants off, 
 Imma play this Gladys Knight, 
 Me and you gon' get right, 
 Twista: 
 I got you lookin' at the gliss at my hands and wrists 
 While I'm layin back and smokin' on my canibus 
 When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther 
 I can tell you ain't no messin with Kan-man and Twist 
 From the Chi and I be 
 Sippin Hennessy 
 Play some R and B 
 Tryina smoke a B 
 Lookin' properly 
 Feelin' on a G 
 And always (Well Well Well Well) 
 Come with me and sip on some heavenly champagne 
 You ain't know Twista can work it like the Whispers 
 Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac 
 The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little spinners 
 While I'm 
 Smokin' on a B (are you gonna be) 
 Dippin through the streets (gonna be) 
 Bumpin R&B (gonna be) 
 And I got to leave (gonna be) 
 On the 23's (gonna be) 
 And I do it (well well well well) 
 When my earth and the wind smoke a fire 
 Let me get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat 
 Put you in a daze for maze 
 Fulfilling your every temptation slow jamin' having deep sex 
 You ready for the world girl 
 Come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me 
 An every moment you controllin' me I'm lovin' the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci 
 And when I come over and bend your ass 
 You be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass 
 I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow 
 Now I gotta go up in it fast, but imma finish last 
 No matter how much of a thug you see 
 I still spit it like it's R&B, come the club with me 
 And when some Luther come on I hope you filla me and stilla be in love with me 
 Twista: 
 Baby drop another slow jam 
 And all us lovers need hold hands 
 And if you ain't got no man hop up on my brougham 
 I keep it pimpin' like an old man 
 You gots to roll with the plan 
 'Cause after that then I 
 Take it to the dome 
 Then I got to bone 
 Stay up in the zone 
 Got to get you home 
 Gotta run up on 
 And I do it (well well well well) 
 Baby drop another slow jam 
 And all us lovers need hold hands 
 And if you ain't got no man hop up on my brougham 
 I keep it pimpin' like an old man 
 You gots to roll with the plan 
 'Cause after that then I 
 Take you to my home 
 And we could get it on 
 Whisper on the phone 
 Just to get you goin' 
 Tryina make you moan 
 And I do it (well well well well) 
 Baby drop another slow jam 
 And all us lovers need hold hands 
 And if you ain't got no man hop up on my brougham 
 I keep it pimpin' like an old man 
 You gots to roll with the plan 
 'Cause after that then I 
 Take it to the dome 
 Then I got to bone 
 Stay up in the zone 
 Got to get you home 
 Gotta run up on 
 And I do it (well well well well)
