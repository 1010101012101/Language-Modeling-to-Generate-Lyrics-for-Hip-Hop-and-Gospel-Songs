 Ray Cash: 
 This for all them mothafuckas talkin' bout they want beef 
 But niggaz never jump when they see you in the street 
 Niggaz thinkin' shit sweet, not knowing 'bout the missles and the pistols 
 If I pop it partna you gon get your issues, when its ripping through your tissue 
 When it's cutting through your muscle, you understand the reason 
 Why I wasn't on the tussle, you was jealous of the hustle 
 I seen it in your eyes, I don't know if it's the money or It's me that he despise 
 Everytime I come around you wanna hop off in the ride 
 If you don't like me, state your case my nigga you ain't got to lie 
 If the beef is really B.I.G. then I'm Ready To Die 
 But I ain't worried about nothing cousin, I know you ain't gonna ride

 Bun B: 
 You born a bitch, you die a bitch, born a ho, you die a ho 
 Fuck niggaz like that, the type of cats I don't even try to know 
 Keep bumpin your gums bitch, watch me come apply the 4 
 Pound pressure and compress your chest just like a xylophone 
 You think yo hood get crunk, let me take you to a wildler zone 
 You can get yo numbers pushed without me having to dial a phone 
 Out of towners get they asses turned into a pile of bones 
 Gangstas catching new cases even when they trial is on 
 I been in real wars when niggaz lost bread, lost work, lost territories some lost heads 
 Reorganized the clique when the under boss fled 
 And at the same time trying not to run across feds 
 So who the fuck is you to try and come and judge me 
 I'm to heavy in this game nigga you can't budge me 
 You ain't gotta love me mothafucka 'cause my momma do 
 Put that on Pimp C mothafucka you don't want the drama you...
