Monday morning, rushed goodbye 
 Trying hard to get to work in time 
 But still you're running late again today 
 Like so many times before 
 Living for the weekend 
 Living for the dream that all will change one day 
 You need a way out, need to find 
 The door to Paradise 
 Emily, take my hand 
 Let me show you another world 
 Follow me to the sun, 
 Flying high in the sky 
 Emily, there is more to this life 
 Than these eyes can see 
 Follow me 
 To the place where you know you belong 
 Can't help but thinking 
 While you are running down the avenue 
 Is this all there is to life 
 Is there more than meets the eye 
 Emily, take my hand 
 Let me show you another world 
 Follow me to the sun, 
 Flying high in the sky 
 Emily, there is more to this life 
 Than these eyes can see 
 Follow me 
 To the place where you know you belong 
 You need to let go now 
 And see what is true this time 
 There's so many things still to be found
