War is a big business (x6) 
 And tax payers are paying at the pumps 
 Global tensions running wild 
 Bodies float across the nile 
 Anthrax sold in vials 
 Oilwells burns for miles 
 How many troops are going in 
 Fighting this war that we can't win 
 Hey mister president 
 There's oil dripping down your chin 
 It began in 91 I watched blood and fuel drip 
 20,000 people are dead now its enough to make you sick 
 How many souls can you rip 
 Take your pick 
 When the guns click 
 Lies spewing from the lips 
 Of bureaucratic hypocrites 
 Holy war, holy shit 
 The koran crucifix 
 Drop them bombs, watch them hit 
 Genocide up in the mix 
 Soldier boy, so fragile, so narrow 
 Now the price of your blood is measured in barrels 
 God damn 
 Uncle Sam's gotta plan 
 With that rifle in his hand man 
 It's a holy war 
 The holy land 
 Is the new vietnam 
 Bodies burning in the sand damn 
 Another holy war 
 What are we fighting for (x8) 
 I see our freedoms over here get taken everyday 
 Seems like our world can't handle what the fuck we got to say 
 Where things are going fake gods, seeds are growing, confusing the people 
 To debate and switch all in the name of hell 
 Put us to war, you make us kill, all in the name of God 
 But worry about an unborn fetus, I think that's fuckin' odd 
 Can't understand how people still use religion 
 To justify all their evils, you fuck, we got a holy war 
 God damn 
 Uncle Sam's gotta plan 
 With that rifle in his hand man 
 It's a holy war 
 The holy land 
 Is the new vietnam 
 Bodies burning in the sand damn 
 Another holy war 
 Visions of violence 
 Blood equals economics 
 As our nations standing catatonic 
 (Give us a holy war) 
 Give us our daily product 
 Dictator sits on his throne 
 His paper the skull and bones 
 Evacuate, the war's over 
 (Another holy war) 
 And bring our soldiers home 
 What is false what is real 
 You can't think, but you can feel 
 Wounded on the battlefield 
 Your sacrifice for mass appeal 
 Propoganda's on the news 
 The public doesn't have a clue 
 Now think of what you're going through 
 Your freedom don't belong to you 
 The world is coming to an end 
 The devil's got an evil grin 
 He's televised on CNN 
 And everybody's tuning in 
 Dog tags 
 Watch 'em drag 
 Body bags 
 Burnin flags 
 The truth hurts 
 When it stabs another victim on the slab 
 God damn 
 Uncle Sam's gotta plan 
 With that rifle in his hand man 
 It's a holy war 
 The holy land 
 Is the new vietnam 
 Bodies burning in the sand damn 
 Another holy war 
 Visions of violence 
 Blood equals economics 
 As our nations standing catatonic 
 (Give us a holy war) 
 Give us our daily product 
 Dictator sits on his throne 
 His paper the skull and bones 
 Evacuate, the war's over 
 (Another holy war) 
 And bring our soldiers home 
 War is a big business (x8) 
 (It's a holy war, another holy war) 
 And the tax payers are the customers
