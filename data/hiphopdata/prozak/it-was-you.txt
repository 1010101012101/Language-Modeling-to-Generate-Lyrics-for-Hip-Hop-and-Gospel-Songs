A hot summer night 
 I was in my bed 
 I coudn't sleep a wink 
 Just laid awake instead 
 I slipped out the sheets careful not to wake her up 
 Insomniac restless got me shaken up 
 I walked down the hall way and out the front door 
 Took a seat on the steps of my front porch 
 The rain was cooling bouncing heavy off that concrete 
 Lightning lit the sky and thunder crashed around me 
 I saw a man on the corner in the pouring rain 
 I'm thinking homeless, hopeless or just insane 
 I called out to him sir can I help you 
 No reply he was motionless, statue, 
 I started walking down the sidewalk to approach him 
 Dressed in black and he stood taller than most men, 
 His trench coat stood still though the wind blows 
 Dejavue premanitions inuendos 
 The car passing by 
 The headlights lit his face 
 Knew you from somewhere, somebody, some place, 
 I seen you before at the hospital 
 My family was crying you were smiling when you passed us all 
 My uncle died that night 
 And now I'm looking back 
 There was a thunder storm yeah and you were dressed in black 
 With the thoughts and memories come to light, come to think about it 
 I realize all the time it was you 
 Only Christ it can save you from 
 If it's a nightmare waiting for 
 What can I do that will save me from 
 I realize all the time it was you 
 Only Christ it can save you from 
 If it's a nightmare waiting for 
 What can I do that will save me from 
 I looked into his eyes and I saw geneside 
 I seen world wars and mass suicides, 
 I saw my father cheat on my mother with another, 
 I saw my mother cheat on my father with his brother 
 I witnessed every evil deed that I've ever done 
 I saw Jesus crusify gods only son 
 I heard screaming victims 
 Play with disease and I 
 I smelled the toxins from the 
 Air that we breathe and I 
 It sounds farfetched but you, 
 You must believe that we 
 Will self-destruct as a 
 Result of greed 
 See I've been watching you 
 And I know everything that you do 
 Where your families at places that you go 
 Every number you dial and every attempt that you make to get away from me is futile 
 So you can't sleep or eat without me ideas about me, you doubt me
