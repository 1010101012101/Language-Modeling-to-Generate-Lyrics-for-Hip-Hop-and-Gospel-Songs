Despite what everyone is sayin' 
 Time hasn't made anything any easier 
 In facti think it hurts worse every single day 
 Everything around me is a constant reminder of him 
 Of usas I write these words, I wonder if any of you 
 Can truly understand what this feels like! 
 Everything you do, I'm right there 
 Please wake me from this nightmare 
 You can't seem to see me but I'm right here 
 Transparent, in the night air 
 Afraid to walk in the light 
 And so I stay here and try to watch you at night 
 Try to hold dear everything in our life 
 If I had more time I would've made you my wife 
 But i, never seen it comin' it was so fast 
 Tried to hold on, but I couldn't last 
 As I laid dying, everything flashed 
 All our hopes and dreams are now passed 
 I'm still beside you, but you can't see 
 I know you want it back, but it can't be 
 I'm afraid the darkness now has me 
 Just try to live on and be happy 
 Ba-by I will see you a-gain 
 Just know that I love you 
 Always thinking of you 
 Ever since you went away 
 Not much left to live for 
 Close my eyes and wish for 
 Just to have you one more day 
 Nothin' is the same now 
 All I feel is pain now 
 I will never be the same 
 Always have the same frown 
 All I do is break down 
 Every time I hear your name 
 I know how this must sound 
 But I know he's still here with me 
 At first I pretended as if I didn't notice 
 I thought that the grief was playin' tricks on my mind 
 I would see him while passing the mirrors in our home 
 And hear him calling at night 
 Sometimes it would water my eyes 
 When you stare off into space and cry 
 For a second I feel so alive 
 But the it, sets in that I'm nothin' besides 
 A ghost, my God is empty I wish I was set free 
 Afraid to leave, she will forget me 
 I scream in vain 
 I speak her name 
 It's so hard when I see her in pain 
 There's nothin' I can do to comfort her 
 And death itself couldn't take my love for her 
 Nothin' is left for judgement that must occur 
 And everything else is becoming such a blur 
 Fading away and everything turns dark 
 Goin' away to a place so far 
 Leaving you now, we must be apart 
 But I'll go on livin' in your heart 
 Ba-by I will see you a-gain 
 Just know that I love you 
 Always thinking of you 
 Ever since you went away 
 Not much left to live for 
 Close my eyes and wish for 
 Just to have you one more day 
 Nothin' is the same now 
 All I feel is pain now 
 I will never be the same 
 Always have the same frown 
 All I do is break down 
 Every time I hear your name 
 It's been some time now since he called me 
 I fear that he's grown tired of waiting 
 Counting the days of this mortal life seems almost unbearable anymore 
 Some say that Heaven is in the eye of the beholder 
 There is nothing I would want more in this world, or the next 
 Than to be with him if he has refused to move on 
 To stay stuck between worlds just to remain here by my side 
 I owe this to him please try to understand, I love you very much 
 Tell Dad I love himwe will all be together again soon enough, and never have 
 To lose each other again goodbye for now, but remember eternity is forever 
 Just know that I love you 
 Always thinking of you 
 Ever since you went away 
 Not much left to live for 
 Close our eyes and wish for 
 Just to have you one more day 
 Nothin' is the same now 
 All I feel is pain now 
 I will never be the same 
 Always have the same frown 
 All I do is break down 
 Every time I hear your name 
 Ba-by I will see you a-gain
