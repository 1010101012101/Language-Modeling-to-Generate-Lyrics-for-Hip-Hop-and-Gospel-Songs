Oxycotten man, that shit is right but uh, 
 Crush em' and snort em' and all your problems are forgotten oh 
 20's, 40's, 80's 
 Addicted huh? maybe. 
 My nose is bleeding, 
 I keep itching like I've got rabis 
 Just let it drain 
 Another synthetic, pathetic method to submerge my inner pain. 
 Blame my family and friends 
 Who else? it just depends 
 Just want it all to end, 
 I need to snort again. 
 I need some more drugs, like all 6 of them, 
 I'll take these vicodens, hey you pass the clionopens. 
 They're banging at the bathroom door, but I can't let them in. 
 Rigitmortis, pale blue on white porcelin 
 Oh wee oh wee oh 
 Drugs they take control 
 Oh wee oh wee oh 
 Drugs they own my soul 
 No where to even explain 
 I couldn't think to reframe 
 My life can be summed up in one word 
 Cocaine. 
 Ill leave the end of the straw that I snorted through 
 And when I'm through Ill rub my teeth with the residue. 
 I'm always thinkin' about the next line 
 Man I know I owe you 3 bills, fuck it I'll pay you next time. 
 I gotta score some more no matter what the cost is. 
 Man I can't even feel my face, my nose is frostbit 
 High as a kite (whispers) 
 I"m having palpitutions 
 I do this every night (whispers) 
 Its self desicration 
 I don't know wrong from right (whispers) 
 I can't resist tempatation 
 Hope I will be all right (whispers) 
 Its self anninhaltion 
 Your G for grindin hard 
 You cannot catch your breath 
 Your eyes are dialated 
 Welcome to crystal meth! 
 Stick deprivation now intertwined with some chemicals 
 And as a result, the twisted relm of scenarios 
 Paranoid, hearing police scanners and radios 
 The voices in your head now speak to you in stero. 
 Seeing shadows around the corners of your eyeballs 
 Just smoke the rest and hide in the closet till nightfall. 
 Midnight, its time to make the escape 
 Jumped in the ride 
 Time is horrorsome, oh you can't wait 
 Backin outta the driveway but didn't look both ways 
 Another tweaker dead, 
 Obituary paid 
 They call my name 
 They are to blame 
 Needles in my vain 
 Here we go again 2x 
 Drugs 7x (fading)
