Maybe it's just best to leave my by my lonely, homie 
 Maybe we ain't friends, if you want my trust show me 
 People actin' kinda funny like a full moon 
 Got me feelin' dark gloom, and igniting my psycho just like some gas fumes (3x) 
 Maybe I should set an example, extract some blood samples 
 Run this razor blade across his throat and adam's apple, 
 Dismantle his body into pieces, sink him in this reservoir 
 What the fuck you starin' at, what the fuck you take me for? 
 Take this as an act of war, 
 Dressed in black and strap my lord 
 Act like demons from the past I'm tappin' at your chamber door 
 Quote the raven "nevermore", Edger Allen, I implore 
 Hope you prayed before you were placed underneath this cellar boards 
 I'm goin' out like berkowitz, your existence superfluous, 
 My persistence to hurt you and remove you from this earth 
 And it's vital that I complete the cycle, 
 Proceed to murder your idols on pins and needles, leave you bleedin' with knives and rifles. 
 I've been in this game so long, 
 I'm numb to the pain, hold on 
 I function this way, mind gone, 
 You takin' my place? (Dead wrong) 
 I'm infamous, incision you to increments, 
 With these instruments of vigilance, have you wishin' for innocence 
 Beat you into submission, bitch 
 Show you the mind of villain instead of killin' it, lyrically like you ain't feelin' this 
 Always perceiving, steven to be the seed of a demon 
 Cause you can't seem to beat 'em or cease 'em from breathin'. 
 I'm sick of this, ignorance, illegitimate, hatin' shit 
 Bitches, stay up out my mix, jockin' on my style, so sick 
 You talk about my style so much you might as well be my publicist, 
 Twenty-ten, back again, resurrect like I'm from Nazareth 
 Huh, people actin' real funny, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 There must be a full moon in this mother fucker of something.
