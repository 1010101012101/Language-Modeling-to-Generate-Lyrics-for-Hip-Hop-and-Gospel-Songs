(Hook:Prozak) 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 See right through your lies 
 Everything you pretend to be 
 And it comes as no surprise 
 Hater in disguise 
 That you are my enemy 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 See right through your lies 
 Everything you pretend to be 
 And it comes as no surprise 
 Hater in disguise 
 That you are my enemy 
 (Verse 1:Prozak) 
 Just look at you I see you staring all green with envy 
 You wishin upon a star hoping that one day you can end me 
 Bitch 
 Look deep into my eyes 
 You don't Know truth from lies 
 And it comes as no surprise 
 That I'm not the kind to empathize 
 Retaliation must 
 Anhiallation bust 
 A violation garunteed to make your skull crush 
 A savage assassin it belongs to a famule like Manson 
 Attacking at random 
 By sellin your soul for ransom 
 Tall dark and handsome 
 300 pounds and then some 
 I call me click with the full clip inside of me handgun 
 And if you really want it with me then you can have some 
 But I suggest you listen to the words inside this anthem 
 So can you back it up and there's no place you can run 
 Hitchcock of Hip-Hop, lights camera, action! 
 In terms of intellect it's simple that my shit is pure 
 It makes me wonder how the fuck you got so insecure 
 (Hook:Prozak) 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 See right through your lies 
 Everything you pretend to be 
 And it comes as no surprise 
 Hater in disguise 
 That you are my enemy 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 See right through your lies 
 Everything you pretend to be 
 And it comes as no surprise 
 Hater in disguise 
 That you are my enemy 
 (Verse 2:Prozak) 
 I get it how I live it 
 I hustle every minute 
 It's sloppy seconds pick and 
 Done ready ran up in it 
 No matter how much you say and despite them things you do 
 And keep in mind this cancerous karma comes back to you 
 I kinda wonder if you ponder in your slumber 
 Thoughts of trying to solve your blunders but plots are takin' me under fag 
 But you must muster enough strength to stop this thunder 
 And think before you plunder 
 You might find yourself in a body bag 
 I must be doin' somethin' 
 I got you haters talkin' 
 Keep out these bitches gawkin 
 Check out those people moshin' 
 Been known to keep it popin' 
 Still got these albums droppin' 
 This fights a play your hatian 
 I hit the nation, nothin' 
 Hip-hop the cynical 
 Rock, rap, political 
 Lyrics so critical 
 Pivital each and every syllable 
 Always original 
 Traitors cut your umbilicle 
 Immitator recipricle 
 Then your late in my pentacle 
 (Hook:Prozak) 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 See right through your lies 
 Everything you pretend to be 
 And it comes as no surprise 
 Hater in disguise 
 That you are my enemy 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 See right through your lies 
 Everything you pretend to be 
 And it comes as no surprise 
 Hater in disguise 
 That you are my enemy 
 (Verse 3:Tech N9ne) 
 (Puss!) 
 I can see you hatin' this 
 Life I leave when I'm makin' it 
 Well deserved the seldom words 
 And I can feel you fakin' bitch 
 Ain't never no mistakin with 
 That demon inside is blatant shit 
 Like when I come around hating quits 
 And I smile at a false hand-shakin bitch 
 They already told me what you said 
 Tech is old and the followers dead 
 Forget his flow and fuck his red 
 I be wrong I'mma bust your head 
 Send that punk to the fuckin' meds 
 How you gonna be jealous about my bread 
 When it started out with none of us fed 
 All this time we sweat and bled 
 And you salty awfully faulty 
 Wish your death and envy you let you're a pals feed 
 Off me 
 I'm a thirsty killer 
 And I'm quick to drugs these till her 
 And you cannot hurt me, skrill her 
 When I think like Percy Miller 
 In my vicinity 
 Don't pretend to be a friend of me 
 Cause sin is he who be grim and deminish me 
 Like I was Kennedy 
 When it be, serenity 
 I'll be finicky 
 About bein around you motherfuckers 'cause you're my enemy! 
 (Hook:Prozak) 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 See right through your lies 
 Everything you pretend to be 
 And it comes as no surprise 
 Hater in disguise 
 That you are my enemy 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 See right through your lies 
 Everything you pretend to be 
 And it comes as no surprise 
 Hater in disguise 
 That you are my enemy
