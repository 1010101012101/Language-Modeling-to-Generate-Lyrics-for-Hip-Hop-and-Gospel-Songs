We just, hurt each other 
 We're destroying each other 
 And we are just fading away 
 Soon there will be no place to go 
 Reach the end of all we know 
 These small minds we can not grow 
 We are just fading away 
 It's kinda funny when you think about it 
 The fact that we're all in this 
 Together 
 But yet we still complain about it 
 Separated by race, or religion 
 Or the income that what makes me come to Pace 
 On whether or not to embrace them 
 We got to stop with the hatin' 
 For heaven sakes we're mistakin' 
 With all 
 This blatant shameful acts of abomination 
 These trials and tribulation should be the education 
 Of what makes your 
 History doesn't 
 Repeat itself with these mistakes again 
 To put it in laymen 
 We're just some homosapien inhabitan' 
 The same planet 
 And having to maintain within 
 Maybe we could work together 
 To make this 
 Place better for future generations 
 The Children 
 Someday they may never experience 
 Hunger and famine 
 Disease and planet contaminants 
 Extinction level damage 
 Leaving them stranded and ravenous 
 Submerged in sabotage from these centuries of habits 
 Like thieves in the Night stole their future 
 Before they could even have it 
 Man it's so volatile how we're falling like dominos 
 Just drowning in our own sorrows no thought of what tomorrow holds 
 And these seeds of misery are sproutin' 
 You can clearly see you and me up in the seeping it's astounding 
 How we fall journey through life 
 Conflicted with all the strife 
 Afflicted with all these lies 
 Tryin' to simply survive 
 Hoping our souls will suffice 
 Just need to open our eyes 
 And see the devils disguise 
 Or sadly meet our 
 Demise 
 And I know it seems impossible 
 The top of these obstacles 
 And things ain't always what they appear to be inside of the optical 
 Illusion of human ruin that you and me is pursuin' 
 So cruel and unusually worded and congruent with influence 
 To destroy and deceive us all 
 Place our back against the wall 
 Bring ourselves to a crawl 
 Dwell on each and every floor 
 Is it to true to recall? 
 And we not even evolved? 
 Is there to much to resolve? 
 Now we all, now we all fall. 
 We just, hurt each other 
 We're destroying each other 
 And we are just fading away 
 Soon there will be no place to go 
 Reach the end of all we know 
 These small minds we can not grow 
 We are just fading away
