I tried to hold my own, safe face, maintain 
 The only light in my tunnel is this freight train 
 Moving at the speed of karma, it's insane 
 One minute you're on top, next you're in flames 
 Burn like embers on this amplitude 
 What happened to the yes men that surrounded you? 
 What happened to loyalty, respect and gratitude? 
 Vultures, when they thought you had something they surrounded you 
 Horde of vampires, drain you of your own well beings 
 Stepping on necks on the quest to become king 
 Cutthroats, turncoats, manifest like dope fiends 
 Insult to injury, choke with their own hall strings 
 Enemies of the worst kind, souls black like shoeshine 
 Nature of the hater - perpetrator, they consume time 
 666 metaphorically their true sign 
 Trust me, you will see them and receive them all in due time 
 Enemies 
 I can't take this - no more 
 This is my life - not yours 
 So what the fuck are you hatin' for? 
 I must be something you can't ignore 
 I keep on pursuing the suited and as if the real person in Prozak are come crewing and there's 2 of them 
 Connected at the souls, symbolic the black hole 
 The secretly seeking dominance, I'm under its control 
 Nowhere to turn next, thoughts are out of context 
 Life is out of focus and I'm hopin to survive this 
 Depression, lost my way, no direction 
 Well under midst of career resurrection 
 Shed a tear for my form of reflection 
 You have a victim in the battlefield of deception 
 Well on the quest to keep it real, he but step in 
 Through the landmines of his own mind's invention 
 Wolves in sheep's clothing, deceitful screte smoking 
 Evil is omnipotent, it's all-seeing, all-knowing 
 Keep your eyes open for bad signs and omens 
 Or get fed to the lions like ancient times of romans 
 For real though 
 I can't take this - no more 
 This is my life - not yours 
 So what the fuck are you hatin' for? 
 I must be something you can't ignore 
 Like a jack of all trades and the king but no such 
 Ex renegade to the game, I'm looking 'round like what's next 
 Been through it all, man through stolen ideas 
 To shady record labels tryina put bullets through my career 
 And even some of my peers, who weren't as they appeared 
 Back stabbing faggot rappers who hold themselves dear 
 But it stops here, I'm on top, I'm back again 
 It's a new year for the focus and dedication 
 I'm your worst fear to seek me shining and grinding 
 Through the core of the storm and it's on, I keep lightning 
 I'mma keep writing, keep performing and keep fighting 
 Keep spiting, you industry whores, my crowd hyping 
 I can't take this - no more 
 This is my life - not yours 
 So what the fuck are you hatin' for? 
 I must be something you can't ignore
