Sometimes it seems we're falling 
 When you feel like giving up (giving up) 
 When you feel enough's enough (enough's enough) 
 I'll be there to lift you up (to lift you up) 
 Always be there when times get rough 
 Sometimes your souls is so heavy it drags you to the ground 
 You pray for better days like sunshine through black clouds 
 Sometimes it feels so lonely like you are the one and only person 
 I'm just hopin deep inside it leaves you freezing coldly 
 Nowhere to turn to, nothing seems to concern you 
 Dwelling and yelling, cursing the names of people that burned you 
 You gotta learn to let it go 
 Negativity slowly slithers into your soul to cause cancerous energy 
 You're only givin' ammunition to enemies 
 Homie trust me, I've been there and done it, it's like a deadly disease 
 A cat and mouse game, pulling on your heart strings 
 Cause life has a funny way of making you feel mundane 
 But trust me it will get better, always remember 
 It gets the darkest before dawn, friend try to keep your head up 
 Your future is bright with the right pair of eyes you will see 
 Even in the dark of night if you'd listen to me 
 When you feel like giving up (giving up) 
 When you feel enough's enough (enough's enough) 
 I'll be there to lift you up (to lift you up) 
 Always be there when 
 times get rough 
 So discouraging when problems are flourishing 
 Pursuing you at the same time, where is the nourishment? 
 When the wings are pulled, drag yourself up off the floor 
 You owe it to yourself to go for self to go to war and take back what is yours 
 Break through barricades with rage like you're unstoppable 
 To accomplish on top of these off-road roadblocks and obstacles 
 You gotta get sick with this serendipity, stick with it 
 Like we're staring to the depths of the abyss, we're haters instruments 
 It's a void textual, manifestation cesspool 
 Entity of aggravated haters and all those other fools 
 Don't let it consumed you but groom you, penetrate through you 
 You'll be doomed to become what you hate 
 For heaven's sake I'm praying for you 
 I know you're stronger and better, to never ever fall victim to false fiction 
 To recall your life's mission uh 
 Stand with conviction, with perseverance ambition 
 And guided by intuition you will defy and surpass the friction 
 When you feel like giving up (giving up) 
 When you feel enough's enough (enough's enough) 
 I'll be there to lift you up (to lift you up) 
 Always be there when times get rough 
 When you feel like giving up (giving up) 
 When you feel enough's enough (enough's enough) 
 I'll be there to lift you up (to lift you up) 
 Always be there when times get rough 
 Sometimes it seems we're falling down
