Vigilante, vigilante 
 Vigilante, vigilante 
 I feel the excitement, there is no turning back 
 I feel that I'm righteous just like the Zodiac 
 And take a look at that, that man is smoking crack 
 I hit him with a bat and now his neck is snapped 
 Sprinkle of holy water, then said a prayer 
 I send that demon back to hell, down to Satan's lair 
 Wait, what's over there? I think I spot some more 
 I think they're hell's minions and they're disguised as whores 
 I started walking past them, then I attacked the random 
 I scream the hail Mary every single time I stabbed em 
 These are the end of days, this is the end of time 
 Human purification, this is a hate crime 
 It's so sad to say, so many passed away 
 Sent a foreign grim stone, the young pastor waits 
 Some say my heart is weak, so many led astray 
 There'll be better days or either there'll be no more pain 
 But for the first time but there won't be no better days 
 Look into his eyes, you think he is a mental case? 
 A vigilante in his mind, he can sink the day 
 A vigilante in his mind, he shall sink the day 
 I'm so out of the ordinary 
 My mind is like a sword I carry 
 And through rhyme I destroy adversaries 
 Turned a freestyle battle to a mortuary 
 Carry guns and knives, kill sluts and wives 
 They're the reason that we're fucking up most of our lives 
 It took a while to realize that maybe it's a excuse 
 But they gotta take me alive from the murdering in the booth 
 Keep while the chipping tooth cause the mic's too close 
 But I pretend it's a bitch and I just spit on the throat 
 Maybe I need a little help, but not from a script 
 I need more emcees to help murder a bitch 
 It's so sad to say, so many passed away 
 Sent a foreign grim stone, the young pastor waits 
 Some say my heart is weak, so many led astray 
 There'll be better days or either there'll be no more pain 
 But for the first time but there won't be no better days 
 Look into his eyes, you think he is a mental case? 
 A vigilante in his mind, he can sink the day 
 A vigilante in his mind, he shall sink the day 
 Lyrically I'm a dream chased, a ski mask 
 And no face, ghost face, I'm Ghost Rider 
 With the spirit of vengeance and a skull of fire 
 Bout to seek out the witches and point out you liars 
 All the fakers and biters like vampires 
 They tryina drain us dry hoping that we retire 
 Going deeper than the underground this time around 
 Pay attention real close to all the shit that's going down 
 Bout to hit you 3 times with a blast of 45 
 Death wish to the script, keeping true to every line 
 To the followed every sign that pointed a hollow grave 
 Then I wouldn't be here tryin' to save the fuckin' day 
 It's so sad to say, so many passed away 
 Sent a foreign grim stone, the young pastor waits 
 Some say my heart is weak, so many led astray 
 There'll be better days or either there'll be no more pain 
 But for the first time but there won't be no better days 
 Look into his eyes, you think he is a mental case? 
 A vigilante in his mind, he can sink the day 
 A vigilante in his mind, he shall sink the day
