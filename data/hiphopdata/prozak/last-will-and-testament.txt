We all gon die, baby 
 So please don't cry, baby 
 We can unite, one day 
 Up in the sky, some day 
 We all gon die, baby 
 So please don't cry, baby 
 We can unite, one day 
 Up in the sky, some day 
 I know it's hard when you lose a loved one 
 Wanna punch walls and let the tears run 
 Don't even know where these emotions come from 
 Gotta let it our before you become undone 
 All these thoughts just flood ya mind 
 And you can't take it back don't hit rewind 
 Then it seems so black at the finish line 
 Life burns so fast in the hands of time 
 Wer all born to die the one guarantee in life 
 The question is why 
 We search for years and the answer's clear you gotta look straight up to the sky 
 Its out of our control 
 The final roll 
 But that don't make it hurt any less 
 Make ya heart so cold 
 And ya pain so old 
 Feelin' like ya got a hole in ya chest 
 Eyes vacant like an empty room 
 All ya feel is dread, impending doom 
 And ya mood is consumed by dark and gloom 
 You just wish this pain would end soon 
 But as everyone say the same cliches 
 Reminisce and pray for better days 
 All you really want is to go away 
 Just want to be left alone today 
 We all need to grieve in our own way 
 We got our own beliefs and that's okay 
 We've all known it comes to this some day 
 Runnin' down life's desolate highway 
 We gotta make the best of it and stay connected with the memories 
 And the-a elements because one day it's evident 
 The only evidence will be the last will and testament 
 We all gon die, baby 
 So please don't cry, baby 
 We can unite, one day 
 Up in the sky, some day 
 We all gon die, baby 
 So please don't cry, baby 
 We can unite, one day 
 Up in the sky, some day 
 You gotta keep your many thoughts and prayers 
 Close to your heart and move on from there 
 Celebrate their live and the times you shared 
 And realize that can never be taken anywhere 
 They're now a part of your soul through the highs and lows 
 And even when you think it's our of control 
 They'll be right beside you like a lie inside you 
 And shining so bright to keep safe and guide you 
 People never really doubt the energy moves on 
 To another realm where we were conceived from 
 From of the dark we were destined to become 
 Part a the rhythm of life hidden like a beat drum 
 Keep your head up and hold it high 
 Even through the worse y'all just take it in stride 
 'Cause it is a gift when you wake up alive 
 When you like a jet man you be ready to fly 
 Only alive for a little while 
 Before you gotta walk alone down the green mile 
 You get the most out of life in the meanwhile 
 And ya neva settle for less then you deserve child 
 It is all in ya hands 
 Everything you demand 
 Everything that ta git 
 And everything that ya plan 
 Everywhere that ya go 
 And everybody ya know
