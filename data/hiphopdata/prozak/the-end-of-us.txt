How many times must you try, must you fail? 
 Freedom is a state of mind, transcended through hell 
 Give it up, walk away 
 You must comform to the norm 
 You been a slave to the grind from before you was born 
 Product of environment, must obey till retirement 
 You see the shackling chains hang from the monument 
 A hundred lives for every question you ask 
 You spent in animations like it's contradicts from the past 
 Extortion 
 Distortion 
 The words that they believe 
 My friend this is the end of us 
 Abortion 
 Emotion 
 To force upon the weak 
 So great this is the end of us 
 Extortion

 My friend this is the end of us 
 Abortion 
 Emotion 
 To force upon the weak 
 So great this is the end of us 
 The brother then is sent strange through the hourglass 
 You're in a spirit filled with rage as the hours pass 
 You can't describe how contrived is the final math 
 And your salvation all relies on financial class 
 Right now is the rise and the fall 
 Clenching up your fists with your back against the wall 
 You must fight for your lives with your eyes on the ball 
 If it trade through the gates and repel down the walls

 All right, stop, listen 
 What's that sound? 
 Just think for a minute 
 And discover what is going down 
 You farm bred to become consumers 
 But who consumes who in this land of maneuvers? 
 The crafty ways in this maze 
 End of days, a perfect match for the empty graves 
 It's about time we think for ourselves 
 It's the right time to put the lies on the shelves 
 What!
