(Verse 1:Prozak) 
 You see, every day remains the same for me 
 I often wonder what it takes to just set me free 
 I stare into this dark abyss that I know is my life 
 No where to run, no where to hide, no way to cope or strife 
 And everything I see is gray, now the colors are gone 
 They slowly fade away into the lyrics of the song 
 Searching for sanctuary peace of mind, but somethings wrong 
 I lost myself along the way and it's been far too long 
 Somebody tell me where's my kindred spirit 
 (I try to transcend) 
 And all I catch is interference 
 (How will this all end?) 
 Hoping that someone can hear this 
 (Let pills desolve in) 
 I think I'm finally thinking clearest 
 (Just hope you feel this y'all!) 
 Things will never ever be the same again 
 I hope that you will understand the pain I was in 
 I wanna thank you for the times of being a friend 
 Sorry I've reached the end, maybe I'll see you again

 (Verse 2:Prozak) 
 All apologies to people I will leave behind 
 I can't explain the pain and rage that dwells inside of my mind 
 I feel I've lost the war inside my head that keeps me alive 
 And everything I've ever loved is gonna slowly subside 
 Into the darkest night you've ever seen 
 My soul is tainted, nothing clean 
 Some say that life is but a dream 
 But nightmares only come for me 
 So tell me where they go 
 With inner demons at my door 
 They're always fighting for control 
 And trynna be feeding off my soul 
 No longer know my ups from downs 
 No happiness, just only frowns 
 I'm always staring at the ground 
 Just hoping something comes around 
 And now my visions blurry surely 
 I'm fading fast and in a hurry 
 (Maybe death could finally cure me 
 Never thought I'd leave this early) 
 Things will never ever be the same again 
 I hope that you will understand the pain I was in 
 Thank you for the times of being a friend 
 Sorry I've reached the end, maybe I'll see you again

 (Same again) 
 (Pain I was in) 
 (Being a friend) 
 (Maybe I'll see you again) 
 (I try to transcend) 
 (How will this all end?) 
 (Let pills dissolve in) 
 (Just hope you feel this y'all) 
 Things will never ever be the same again 
 I hope that you will understand the pain I was in 
 I wanna thank you for the times of being a friend 
 Sorry I've reached the end, maybe I'll see you again
