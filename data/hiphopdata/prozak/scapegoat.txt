And some say it's music like this inspires violence 
 Violence 
 It's gonna make you kill 
 Prozak 
 There's something wrong with the guy 
 Explicit lyrics talking about suicide, violence, mass murders 
 It's been a decade now I've mastered my craft 
 Stay quick and sharp as a tack stick like the axe in your back 
 Perhaps I'm strapped with a gat but best to step the fuck back 
 Three hundred pounds of the tats 
 Prepared to step the face flat 
 I'm the reason heathens quit breathing by bleeding from lesions 
 Leading these demons through killing seasons and leave them grieving 
 No need in proceeding your begging and pleading 
 Only appeasing my thirst for blood, I'll stop when Hell is freezing 
 The Hitchcock of hip hop, the darkest shit on the block 
 These haters hate it cause their bitches I jock 
 I got it on lock, dropped like these empty shells from a Glock 
 I'm quick to blow up your spot and watch your corpse as it rots 
 Going to Hell (and they wanna blame me!) 
 And your children rebel (now they wanna name me!) 
 Wanna put me in jail ('cause I know they hate me!) 
 I'm tired, I'm tired, sick of bullshit 
 When your life's at an end (and you're going crazy!) 
 And violence is a trend ('cause it's what they made me!) 
 I'm tired, I'm tired, sick of bullshit 
 I'm tired, I'm tired, sick of bullshit 
 They try to blame me for school shootings 
 Disputing freedom of speech, they're saying their minds we are polluting 
 But what happened to people being responsible for things they did? 
 Red Lake that reservation yo fuck that kid 
 This shit ain't suitable for weak minds 
 Explicit lyrics and deep rhymes, just relax and it will be fine 
 No need to shoot up your school, no need to act a fool 
 No need to drown the neighbour bitch inside your swimming pool 
 No need to slit your wrists to be noticed 
 But if you must remain focused, slit horizontal and then quote this 
 I am a bitch, I am so weak, I can not take this life 
 It ain't my fault I killed myself, in fact I blame this knife 
 Going to Hell (and they wanna blame me!) 
 And your children rebel (now they wanna name me!) 
 Wanna put me in jail ('cause I know they hate me!) 
 I'm tired, I'm tired, sick of bullshit 
 When your life's at an end (and you're going crazy!) 
 And violence is a trend ('cause it's what they made me!) 
 I'm tired, I'm tired, sick of bullshit 
 I'm tired, I'm tired, sick of bullshit 
 Sometimes I can't stand it, anti-the-whole-planet 
 I wish that I could vanish, I know I take for granted 
 But can you blame me for feeling I'm going crazy 
 In this world where it is legal to kill a baby inside a lady? 
 And even worse now this gay shit is a trend 
 Emo faggots wearing girl pants huh where does it end? 
 But you're telling me to keep an open mind, shit my mind is open 
 I think your jaw might fall from the dicks that you've been smoking 
 And can anybody tell me what the fuck a metrosexual is? 
 And what religion's got these preachers out here touching kids? 
 Never mind I don't think that it was meant for me to know this 
 I'm going straight to Hell as if you didn't notice 
 Going to Hell (and they wanna blame me!) 
 And your children rebel (now they wanna name me!) 
 Wanna put me in jail ('cause I know they hate me!) 
 I'm tired, I'm tired, sick of bullshit 
 When your life's at an end (and you're going crazy!) 
 And violence is a trend ('cause it's what they made me!) 
 I'm tired, I'm tired, sick of bullshit 
 I'm tired, I'm tired, sick of bullshit
