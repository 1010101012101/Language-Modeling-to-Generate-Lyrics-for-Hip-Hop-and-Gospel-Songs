Yeah 
 And the question is why 
 Prozzak, Saganow what up 
 Tech N9ne, Kansas City what up 
 Twista, Chi-Town what up 
 And we do it like this 
 (Verse 1 - Prozak) 
 How can somebody explain to me 
 Why we been followed by evil for so many centuries 
 Locked in prison the world is a penitentiry 
 Such a catastrophe and it follows our destiny 
 But crack head mothers and fathers are beating their children 
 Suicide bombers are crashing our planes into buildings 
 While HIV is spreadin' and killin' off millions 
 And down in New Orleans there's several abandonded civilians 
 They're spillin the blood of other people for barrels of oil 
 The bodies are burning and scattered all over the soil 
 Feeling the tension as tempers and temperatures boil 
 Strikin the soul is a serpent that rattles and coils 
 God, tell me what has now become of us 
 Shame on us for becoming a race so dangerous 
 And even with hate in us 
 You never did stray from us 
 Instead of forsaking us 
 You have forgaven us 
 Why??? 
 Why??? 
 Why does the devil be callin' my name 
 Why??? 
 Testin' my faith with his devilish games 
 Why??? 
 Feeling insane as I was in the brain 
 Why oh Why??? 
 Followed by darkness you become and grow 
 Why??? 
 Circle above me you circle like crows 
 Why??? 
 Father forgive me you reap what you sow 
 Why oh Why??? 
 (Verse 2 - Tech N9ne) 
 Do we get off on the fact that our governments fuckin' Iraq from the back 
 And we know that this hate is from us and not from Allah 
 Why do we gamble with givers of grief 
 And I'm wondering why do we live in the dark and my life's not fa la la la la la la 
 Momma be askin' me, (why) do you believe in this 
 Bitches be askin' me, (why) don't you wanna peep in this 
 Niggas be askin' me, (why) do you put pussy on a pedestal 
 Pimpin' you probly should put money first 'cause you weak in this 
 Why's this shit draggin' 
 Why does everybody know to operate a fully automatic 
 And nobody with the lovin' of the one above us, givin' us little bit of light up in the hell of it 
 Everybody livin' in polygomy you givin' me but ain't nobody celibate 
 So the question we askin' is why? 
 Are we the wickedness when is the trip of the sickest the fly 
 Look at the blood and the tears and the piss and the shit in yo eye 
 God will be back any day any seconds away from the day that he's praying we die 
 Why??? 
 Why does the devil be callin' my name 
 Why??? 
 Testin' my faith with his devilish games 
 Why??? 
 Feeling insane as I was in the brain 
 Why oh Why??? 
 Followed by darkness you become and grow 
 Why??? 
 Circle above me you circle like crows 
 Why??? 
 Father forgive me you reap what you sow 
 Why oh Why??? 
 (Verse 3 - Twista) 
 Could you tell me why would he ever show mercy these days 
 Why??? 
 Just look at the world we be cursin the earth with these plagues 
 Why??? 
 Somtimes I feel evil as if it's the birth of the worst 
 And the Earth needs emergency sergury all of this hurt can be reigned 
 How??? 
 Turn us into demons that's that's screamin I'm dreamin' that even the devil was special before he got fallin' from grace 
 Why do we murder 
 But God Won't abandone his women and children even though his babys will bust a 380 all in your face 
 Why do we kill 
 Gotta hit him in the body with a bullet will you pull it but he never look a brother see hed love us even if he didn't feel us to the fullest 
 Please tell me Why??? 
 How you love us even though we gotta hurt eachother even our brother or the mother I don't feel it on the realest you can put it any way you wanna put it 
 Why??? 
 Even through the terror on the planet you can still find love 
 Why??? 
 Even through the torture and the murder you can still find love 
 Well if you try to be a rapper on a level of the devil we get buried with the shovel and be cast outta heaven so in hell we can still wind up 
 Why??? 
 Why does the devil be callin' my name 
 Why??? 
 Testin' my faith with his devilish games 
 Why??? 
 Feeling insane as I was in the brain 
 Why oh Why??? 
 Followed by darkness you become and grow 
 Why??? 
 Circle above me you circle like crows 
 Why??? 
 Father forgive me you reap what you sow 
 Why oh Why??? 
 Why??? 
 Why???
