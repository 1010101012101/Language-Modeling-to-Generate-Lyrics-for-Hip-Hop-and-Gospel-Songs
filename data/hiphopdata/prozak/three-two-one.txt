Man I'm really panic'n 
 Feel'n plastic like manikin 
 So please pass me the Xanax 
 I'm just trying to feel like me again 
 Recently I've been needing reasons 
 To even get out of bed 
 The more I think the less I feel 
 ?Imprisoned'd? inside my head 
 And I 
 Can't escape cause there's nowhere to run 
 Should I 
 ?Should I? go right into the sun 
 I feel like 
 Giving up am I the only one 
 A matter of time 
 Till there design will kill everyone 
 It has begun 
 Count Down 3,2,1 
 It's the end of the 
 World (Destruction repeated in background) 
 Count down 3,2,1 
 It's the end of the... 
 Please god help me 
 Please god help me 
 Maybe I've been trying to cope 
 All is lost 
 A loss of hope 
 I don't really care no more 
 Even since that I've awoke 
 Everything is such a joke 
 When you can see through the smoke 
 Find yourself against the rope 
 Now they got you by the throat 
 It's all just too much to bear 
 Is there anybody there 
 Can somebody hear me screaming 
 Anybody, Anywhere 
 How can I 
 Live like this 
 Close my eyes 
 Clutch my fist 
 Nervous twitch 
 I'm alive 
 Yet somehow I don't exist 
 Nothing but an empty shell 
 My body a prison shell 
 All these thoughts surround me 
 Seclusion inside of my own head 
 All of this darkness 
 Holding me hostage 
 Repetitious nonsense 
 Every second constant 
 The ... plan ... 
 No foreign progress...
