(Verse 1:Prozak) 
 Our lives are all about chances and circumstances 
 And hopes that it will advance us 
 Maybe one day we can have the answers 
 What is life, what is death, and what comes after that? 
 And why do the call life a gift if it gets taken back 
 So contradictive our existence to be specific 
 The need to be prolific 
 Superseeds our goal of coexistence 
 It's kind of ironic fueled by grief of valued possesions 
 And in the end we decompose back to nothin'; its senseless 
 You'd figure by now we would get it, leave it, cease and desist it 
 With every instance exhibit ignorance with persistence 
 Would our creator take credit for creating all of us? 
 Or would our God rather refrain and remain anonymous 
 Too tired to move on, too far to turn back 
 Too late to right wrongs, you better move fast 
 Proverbial sands flow through the hourglass 
 As time becomes our emphasis, nemesis as the hours pass 
 (X2) 
 (Verse 2:Prozak) 
 While looking for the savior 
 All alone we roam in the land of the haters 
 Everybody wanna raid us, rape us 
 Forsake us, tame us, man it's so heinous 
 Acts of aggression, blasting the weapon 
 Hey let me ask you a question, with a lack of affection 
 Dissipate, eliminate, obliviate all in reflection 
 Sink back to obscurity straight to the bottom of the depths 
 In this mess of all purity 
 Haters are insecurity 
 Surely, purposely gotta stop prematurily 
 Ain't nowhere to go I can't stop below 
 When the flames burn high and your heart has froze cold 
 Never really thought about the path you chose 
 Left to die in misery alone 
 You gotta make a change while you can 
 Because time is flying and it waits for no man 
 Keep soul control of your whole life span 
 And it holds the roll of Psalms in it's right hand 
 Try to make amends make it right with friends 
 Make use of the time you spend 
 And never look back at the past again 
 Can you get your soul back, well it just depends 
 Too tired to move on, too far to turn back 
 Too late to right wrongs, you better move fast 
 Proverbial sands flow through the hourglass 
 As time becomes our emphasis, nemesis as the hours pass 
 (X2) 
 (Outro/Verse Three:Prozak) 
 Everything as we know it is merely perception 
 Even time the adventure of life synthetic invention 
 There are those that wander in search of direction 
 Aimlessly seeking divine intervention 
 Perhaps one day, they will make the most profound connection 
 That what matters most in this world is our intention 
 Born into a specific place in mankind 
 Positive or negative energy 
 The only thing we leave behind
