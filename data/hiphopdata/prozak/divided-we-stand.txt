All that I've seen 
 All that I've known 
 All is lost now 
 A world without hope 
 Nowhere left to run 
 Nowhere left to go 
 Overpopulated 
 And yet we're all alone 
 Global warming outside 
 But we're still cold 
 On the inside 
 Our souls are froze 
 Grim future 
 Walking down this dead end road 
 Hard to cope 
 When you've reached the end of the rope 
 Nothing left to do 
 But hang in the balance now 
 Just above the poison soil 
 And the toxic ground 
 Polluted oxygen 
 Circles in your lungs while 
 The acid rain 
 Just drains from the black clouds 
 Scared and lost 
 People gather to the streets and crowd 
 No longer simple 
 Thinking of survival somehow 
 Through this threat 
 They are met with projectiles 
 The blood spills 
 As the fires burn for miles 
 Panic and destruction is all that surrounds 
 So you better hit the deck when the bullets hit the ground 
 Ashes to ashes we all fall down 
 Ashes to ashes we all fall down 
 Nothing will remain, take your last look around 
 Now the screams of pain have replaced all the sound 
 Ashes to ashes we all fall down 
 Ashes to ashes we all fall down 
 The time is arrived 
 Now watch it unfold 
 Everything inside 
 Ignites and explodes 
 Don't believe the lies you've been told 
 Don't believe the lies you've been told 
 Endless days of night 
 No light to behold 
 Total loss of life 
 We've lost all control 
 Don't believe the lies you've been told 
 Don't believe the lies you've been told 
 Don't believe the lies you've been told (repeat)
