(Prayer) 
 I can't believe this is you, after everything we've gone through 
 Just look at you and what you been reduced to 
 Artificial life a respirator they've been workin on ya all night it's 
 In the paper how you tried to take yourself out 
 A bottle of pills and when they found you, you were passed out 
 I wonder still as you died did you have doubts 
 When they revived you, you were screamin with you hands out 
 Straight from hell express route 
 I see you lying in this bed now 
 With machines and I.v.'s God please just wanna rip them out 
 But I can't 'cause if I do you will die 
 Damn it's hard to stand beside you as I see you and your family cry 
 Don't know where we go 
 When this life spins outta control 
 When it gets dark and it turns cold 
 And you feelin' like don't nobody know 
 That you're all alone 
 Now ya body shakin I can see the demons over in the corner waitin it's elevating 
 Waitin for ya to crossover the threshold of mortality and deaths border close my 
 Eyes and hold ya hand now it's getting colder knew ya were upset depressed 
 And some what bi polar I tried to warn ya but as usual ya wouldn't listen ya face 
 Is pale ya bodys numb and now ya tears glisten on a mission to self descruct but 
 Know ya wishin for the regret and blind hope and false intuition ya try and try to 
 Hold on but there's nothin' left knowin' each and everyone could be ya last breath 
 That takes ya to ya final rest 
 Don't know where we go 
 When this life spins outta control 
 When it gets dark and it turns cold 
 And you feelin' like don't nobody know 
 That you're all alone 
 Time to pull the plug and then it's through the last rites, words and final hugs ya feel 
 The tears drip on ya and ya feel a tug for the very first time ya finally feelin' love 
 It's too late komatoze and Catatonic state surprise in ya eyes wide ya fill ya fate 
 Eternally damned and dropped off in front of hells gates ya mind, body, and soul 
 Shall now desenegrate as all the demons celebrate. 
 Goodbye
