 From Chile to greece 
 From New Gandhi to your momma

 Natural born serial murderers 
 Bitch, come and meet your maker 
 I'm scare like Michael Jack up close 
 I like diggin up dead bodie 
 Look at me I'm gross 
 My name's Violent J but you can call me suphillis 
 Gonorrhea the clap 'cause I infected this rap 
 You wanna know if I could ever kill somebody 
 Well that's like askin Carlie Manson if he's ever been in jail 
 I kill family, friends, myself 
 What, yeah, I'd kill myself if I could only survive 
 I tried to kill Rob Van Winkle, in fact that's how we met 
 I went up to kill him and he was thinkin' the same shit 
 I pulled out a chainsawm he pulled out and ax 
 I was like come-on, wait is that a Stanley, where'd you get that 
 It's natural and to murder, your gotta have it in you 
 It's ike a dick all up in you, although I wouldn't now 
 Look at us natural killas

 And the most hated group together like woo!

 Remember me

 Well here's my trilogy 
 I'm outta captivity 
 Rap cujo ya know my flow is ferocious 
 Last survivor with a mouth full of cockroaches 
 I bring this hocus pocus 
 You're flying away 
 Like the last days of the motherfuckin loafers 
 I'm the redneck in the moshpit 
 2 axes come in handy 
 To answer Violent j, ya damn right it's a stanley 
 In the shadows of the dark with darkman like spawn 
 In the dash blazin' it up with explosive bombs 
 I spit homicides like major cities at 11PM 
 While zipping bodies in the dungeon like the line at GM 
 Ice mixed with blood is the killers milkshake 
 Here with the clowns from the underground it's a lyrical deathbreak 
 Mass murders 
 Natural born killas 
 I'm not fucking around 
 Icky icky ya ya 
 Icky icky ya ya 
 Disrespect me I'll run in your house 
 Like puffin steam stout 
 Break both your arms, gun in your mouth 
 Knock your teeth out with the nose of the fifth 
 Bullets bust through the back of your head ya die swift 
 Fuckin' wit tha clan, watch what you say 
 We kill ________ 
 Shoot you're with an SK or a AK bitch you gonna die either way 
 I'm a monster thoroughbred gun holding weed-head 
 Cross me bet tomorrow you'll be dead 
 Catch you at a show while you're chilling with your ho 
 And crack your skull with bottle of Mo 
 I'm a Sing-Sing killer 
 Gun groove captain 
 Brooklyn home of the original gun clappin 
 Gats get brung, niggas get done 
 Sons lose fathers and mothers lose sons 
 I'm a killer 
 Mass murders 
 Natural born killas 
 I'm not fucking around 
 Icky icky ya ya 
 Icky icky ya ya 
 To die is a fate that must come to us all 
 But how horrible to be buried alive 
 From the darkness they shuffle eyes glazed with death 
 Hand clawing for blood! 
 Mass murders 
 Natural born killas 
 I'm not fucking around 
 Icky icky ya ya 
 Icky icky ya ya
