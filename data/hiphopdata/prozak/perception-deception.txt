They cultivate your fear 
 To keep you in the cage 
 Manifactured media to keep you entertained 
 The story of your life 
 Every day remains the same 
 Go to work 
 Like a slave 
 Every day 
 Then you die! 
 Expression has been lost 
 So put your dreams on hold 
 And never think for self 
 Do exactly what you're told 
 When they control your mind 
 Then they control you flesh 
 Go to work 
 Like a slave 
 Every day 
 Then you die! 
 Tell me what is real or fake 
 Tell me what is real or fake 
 Perception (Everything) 
 Deception (Every day) 
 Perception (All you know) 
 Deception (Do what you're told) 
 Perception (Hypnotized) 
 Deception (Mesmerized) 
 Perception (I telesized) 
 Deception (Now think alike) 
 Tell me what is real or fake 
 Tell me what is real or fake 
 Where ever lies the truth 
 Amongst this world of lies 
 Misdirection provided to keep you occupied 
 And if you change the channels 
 You will surely change their minds 
 Go to work 
 Like a slave 
 Every day 
 Then you die! 
 History's condemned to (?) repeat itself 
 You must predict the future from the past to save yourself 
 Don't be another victim, (?) hollow shell 
 Go to work 
 Like a slave 
 Every day 
 Then you die! 
 Tell me what is real or fake 
 Tell me what is real or fake 
 Perception (Everything) 
 Deception (Every day) 
 Perception (All you know) 
 Deception (Do what you're told) 
 Perception (Hypnotized) 
 Deception (Mesmerized) 
 Perception (I telesized) 
 Deception (Now think alike) 
 Tell me what is real or fake 
 Tell me what is real or fake 
 I can't seem to figure it out 
 I can't seem to get it right 
 I can't seem to figure it out 
 I can't seem to get it right 
 I can't seem to figure it out 
 I can't seem to get it right 
 I can't seem to figure it out 
 I can't seem to get it right 
 Get it right, get it right, get it right, get it right
