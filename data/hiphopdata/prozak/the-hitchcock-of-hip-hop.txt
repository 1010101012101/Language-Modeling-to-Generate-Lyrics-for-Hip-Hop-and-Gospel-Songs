(Now who are you) I'm the Alfred Hitchcock of hip hop 
 (No you're not) Don't believe me, just wait 'til my shit drops 
 (Thought you knew) Tell sick stories with a suspense plot 
 (Come and watch) Even Edgar Allen Poe would say my shit's hot 
 Hello ladies and gentlemen and good evening 
 You're about to witness the sickest thing ever breathing 
 There's no need to keep pinching yourself, you ain't dreaming 
 Someone please shut that bitch up in the back who's screaming 
 Some people will tell you I'm half angel, plus demon 
 Who's purpose is to stalk the earth for gothic reasons 
 Must've curse at birth for what it's worth, they pulled a heathen 
 I think them a stigmata, so my hands are breathing 
 The devil sends his regards and seasons greetings 
 For those who don't believe in god, he'll be meeting 
 Your life will cease, so rest in peace, your soul is leaving 
 For eternity, burning, begging and pleading
