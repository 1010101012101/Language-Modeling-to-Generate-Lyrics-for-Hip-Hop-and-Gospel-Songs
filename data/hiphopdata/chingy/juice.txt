Wassup y'all?

 We got Jackpot the Pimp in the back 
 We came here today 
 To address a certain issue 
 That all you young playaz need to know about for real 
 Juice these ho's (what)

 All my playaz grab their nuts and juice these ho's (come on) 
 Juice these ho's (what)

 Trick get back, for your ass get smacked (you tell em) 
 Trick get back (what), tricky back (you tell em) 
 Trick get back, for your head get cracked 
 You can't fool me ho 
 With that movie star roll 
 Take your ass to the store or get a job and blow 
 Why should I love ya? 
 Why should I kiss ya? 
 Ganga cats bang ya 
 That's why I dissed ya 
 I'm a paint a picture 
 Didn't them gang hit ya? 
 Now you want me to play sugar daddy

 Crazy asses mental patient in a wheelchurr 
 Take that wave out and go get some real hurr 
 Let's play truth or durr 
 Is it true that you gave head in a phone booth? 
 Girl that shit ain't true but oh, you don't curr 
 When I'm out I see you shurr 
 I don't wanna fuck I wanna get in them pockets 
 Reverse psychology ain't too furr

 Yo check my grip (trick!) 
 Set out them lips, and them hips 
 Ho you can't get a dolla from me (not one dollar) 
 A playa is your man to be (that's me) 
 You are the weakest link girl you I don't need (gon' bout ya bitch) 
 All my cats why don't you say it with me 
 Come with that depressiveness 
 Young minded aggressive shit 
 Class in attention clique 
 Really don't know who you messin with 
 Y'all the same no sexual shit 
 Huh disrespectful bitch 
 Take a look at my neckalace 
 Rowdy then we be out for breakfast 
 You connect them pants as hit 
 Till you reach my mansion miss 
 Never dealt with pressure pimp 
 I retired on every cent 
 Girls talk, dudes do it 
 I ain't heard of impressive chick 
 My lesson is never sweat a chick 
 Puttin' me first like Letterman 
 I'm a better and she better then 
 Well let's freak then exit chick 
 She like to be rubbed where panty thin 
 Talk what she like and get her in 
 Ho you can't get a dolla from me (not one dollar) 
 A playa is your man to be (that's me) 
 You are the weakest link girl you I don't need (gon' bout ya bitch) 
 All my cats why don't you say it with me 
 Been to there now so many times I gotta do these ho's 
 Quit lookin' at me all funny I don't curr if you these ho's 
 This how I view these ho's 
 Can't excuse these ho's 
 Use these ho's for what they worth then lose these ho's 
 It's filled with two peas ho 
 I know that you see 0's 
 In my checkbook and my neck 
 It's usually froze 
 I like them groupie ho's 
 Just come too me show 
 Hit and run without child support 
 Now sue me ho

 Ho you can't get a dolla from me (not one dollar) 
 A playa is your man to be (that's me) 
 You are the weakest link girl you I don't need (gon' bout ya bitch) 
 All my cats why don't you say it with me
