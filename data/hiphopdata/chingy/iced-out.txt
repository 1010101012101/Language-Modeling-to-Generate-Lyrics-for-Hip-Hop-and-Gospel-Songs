Diamonds on my pinky 
 Keep me lookin' blingy 
 Eyes kinda chinky 
 Ya bitch it's chingy 
 Bracelet on my right wrist 
 Watch on my left wrist 
 Four carrots in both ear lobes 
 I think they kinda selfish 
 'Cause they don't like me wearin' nothin' with 'em they so sparkly 
 With all this jewelry on I'm crazy call me Gnarles Barkley 
 See some of you amaze me 
 Man niggas been [? ] lately 
 And man y'all shit fugazi 
 I'm from that essey yellow, but you can say the lou 
 My chain got a cold 'n' it's sneezin' achoo 
 Diamonds on my 
 Diamonds on my wrist 
 Diamonds round my neck 
 Damn like is this
