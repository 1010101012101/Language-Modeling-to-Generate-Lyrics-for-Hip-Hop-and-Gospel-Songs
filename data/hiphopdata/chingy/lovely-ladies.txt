Without great grandmother there's no me 
 Without grandmama there's no me 
 Without ma momma there's no me 
 Dem ladies made our family tree 
 Because I love dem all da same 
 And think of 'em all da same 
 Need sumthin juss ask I got it covered ain't no thang 
 Ma autn jenni works hard and I appreciate that 
 So threw this song ima give my appreciation back 
 Remember a long time ago I would be down in da basement rappin' 
 Shed stomp on da floor 'n' say quit all dat damn snappin 
 She ain't no 20 years from den datz wats makin' all dis happen 
 She ain't no at ma shows 50,000 ppl clappin 
 Plus I wish I culda seen her face wen I bought dat pad 
 Dat waz juss a cool thank you gift from ur growner lad 
 You a (lovely lady) and that's y I'm praisin yah existence 
 Her 'n' howard always tought me 2 make wise decisions 
 Ya we gon make it through I dedicate this to u

 But 1 day just like dem billboards ima bring home a grammy 
 C ma momma momma big momma we kept er in sum drama 
 Couple bad ass grandsons walkin' round wit llamas

 So leave 4 it to you ma appreciation letta

 No sumtimes you want me 2 go 2 church I say I mite 
 Even if I don't you tell me keep god in my life 
 And I still got dem prayin' hands on dat quarter I gave yah 
 A men 2 god but sumtimes I feel like you ma savior
