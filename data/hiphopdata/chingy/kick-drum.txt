My high hat connected to the snur drum 
 And my snur drum connected to the kick drum 
 And my kick drum connected to the beat drum 
 And my beat drum connected to the bass 
 Imma see you when I see you when I'm riden through the hood 
 And if I don't say nothin' homie know it's all good 
 Cause my speaker steady bumpin and my trunk beat thumpin 
 Got a pocket full of dough and your whole block jumpin' 
 I need my high hat 
 I need my kick drum 
 I need my ten stacks 
 Now mumma get some 
 I make ur body rock 
 Into the bass drum 
 Them 808's not 
 In with the snur drum 
 High hat 
 Kick drum 
 Ten stacks 
 Now mumma get some 
 I make ur body rock 
 Into the bass drum 
 Them 808's not 
 In with the snur drum
