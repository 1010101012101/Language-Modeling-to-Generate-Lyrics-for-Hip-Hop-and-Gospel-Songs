 When I see ya I want ya girl 
 Girl I feel like I know ya, 
 Just wanna let you know I got this lil thing for ya 
 Before I saw ya I heard ya and then I met ya 
 If I have to travel the world girl I'm gon catch ya

 If gettin' you was a crime I wanna stay on trial 
 These bustas don't deserve ya, playa he got the nerve to

 Want you to be my friend, lover, homie, and my partner

 And when I'm in your town just tell me where to stay
