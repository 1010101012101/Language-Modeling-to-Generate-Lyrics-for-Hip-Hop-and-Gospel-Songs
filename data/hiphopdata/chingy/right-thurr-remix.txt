[Intro: Chingy] 
 Ay y'all we gon' get it right herr this the remix

 So So Def (ooh ooh) 
 Chingy J.D. 
 Let's do it 
 [Chorus: Chingy] 
 I like the way you do that right thurr 
 Swing your hips when ya walkin' let down ya hairr 
 I like the way you do that right thurr 
 Lick your lips when you're talkin' that make me stirr 
 [Verse 1: Chingy] 
 Girl why you that right thurr 
 She so bad I'm costantly getting calls from the mayorr 
 I though of a rabbit the way she bouncing for thurr carrot 
 Her man defendin' her like a lawyer so bewarr 
 So dudes be handcuffin' but dirty that ain't fair 
 I wanna bet she got the bomb like a terrorist 
 She wit it I'll hit it though but I ain't thinking 'bout marriage 
 I love these honeys might as well call me Papa Bearrr 
 Girl you know you looking good (good) 
 And don't I know you from the hood (hood) 
 You say you wouldn't but you would (would) 
 Now take it off you know you should (should) 
 Now twist around 
 [Chorus: Chingy] 
 I like the way you do that right thurr 
 Swing your hips when ya walkin' let down ya hairr 
 I like the way you do that right thurr

 Lick your lips when you're talkin' that make me stirr 
 [Verse 2: Trina] 
 Ms. Trina make the ballers wanna stirr 
 Still has naughty boots flyin' with the furr 
 Walk with a switch pull it over make it twerk 
 I'ma flirt till it hurt in a throwback skirt 
 I'm that bad bitch, foxy and Don Blaze 
 Rocks on my wrist like pink lemonade 
 Keep your watches and your rings, for them other girls 
 Lil mama rockin' strings and Chanel Pearls 
 I'm back for my crown, fake bitches bow down 
 It's the remix whatcha wanna do now 
 I know you like the way we do this over hurr 
 So get loose in the club like we don't care 
 [Chorus: Chingy] 
 I like the way you do that right thurr 
 Swing your hips when ya walkin' let down ya hairr 
 I like the way you do that right thurr 
 Lick your lips when you're talkin' that make me stirr 
 I like the way you do that right thurr 
 Swing your hips when ya walkin' let down ya hairr 
 I like the way you do that right thurr 
 Lick your lips when you're talkin' that make me stirr 
 [Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri] 
 I'm from the city where they do that Right Thurr the most 
 Outta towner come around and straight overdose 
 Where the hips sing to you and they swing like bump bump bump 
 Like you done walked into a B2K concert 
 Man, back out legs showin' talkin' like 
 Man, who got the drink, and where the party at tonight 
 Damn, that's when they start that backin' it up on ya homie 
 And that's a feeling that you just can't fight with 
 Fired up off that Hyptonic and Hennessey 
 And she can't keep motherfuckin' hands off me 
 We both in the club high bouncing to the beat 
 When she turned around this is what I told her 
 [Chorus: Chingy] 
 I like the way you do that right thurr 
 Swing your hips when ya walkin' let down ya hairr 
 I like the way you do that right thurr 
 Lick your lips when you're talkin' that make me stirr 
 I like the way you do that right thurr 
 Swing your hips when ya walkin' let down ya hairr 
 I like the way you do that right thurr 
 Lick your lips when you're talkin' that make me stirr
