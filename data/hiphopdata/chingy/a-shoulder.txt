I got a shoulda to cry on when ya hurt 
 Right afta you done did yo mutha fuckin' dirt 
 The time ain't not fit the crime 
 But suicide's not the key 
 Reachin' out to my brothas an othas jus like me 
 Somebody lend me a shoulda to cry on 
 Lay ya head on me 
 I'll be right there where you neeeeed 
 Sometimes I feel stressed out but (they ain?) drinkin' quarts 
 Keep mah chest out 
 Many ways of the world keep me swirled on what's the best route 
 Maybe I died young and cookin provide none 
 Plenty hustle for fake not to own an ride, dumb 
 The world is all game do small thangs get small change 
 Lace up ya shoes make moves an let ya balls hang 
 Too many sit back an say how did he git that 
 The first to have they hand out but last to have they shit crack 
 Without a warnin, you could die tonight an be widout a mournin 
 The sun don't shine all the time nigga widout a stormin 
 Smokin' to maintain tryin' to come up off knot 
 A damn thang, it's a damn shame its fun to get done in this damn game 
 So I cry on to get my high on 
 And the prize but I got my eye on do for self what I rely on shows 
 I got a shoulda to cry on when ya hurt 
 Right afta you done did yo mutha fuckin' dirt 
 The time ain't not fit the crime 
 But suicide's not the key 
 Reachin' out to my brothas an othas jus like me 
 Stop the pain, please lord, try ta stop the pain 
 Police out to get us 
 No way they could stop the game 
 Got capone, talk to 'em on prom night 
 Said he need some herb, tell 'em stay calm right 
 I feelin' side effects his olda brotha engaged 
 The cell jail tells sorry for not sendin no mail ale 
 Van gogh wus up wit ja boy fos up 
 Hit 9 times ima rhyme fo miss blatant crimes 
 Y'all know what y'all be doin' 
 Play the role of a g 
 Word out ta git ya 
 A century no history 
 The penitentiary not meant for me so I can't go 
 Not meant for you you chose to go but times move slow 
 Don't ever see me it's gettin' older, behold the 
 Sorrow tomorrow I got a shoulda 
 Man so what you think they in thurr an we out hurr is gravy 
 You crazy 
 The population reslavery 
 Did I forget to rhyme I didn't try to 
 My partner (cuffs me?) down to die too an ride through 
 Let ya time pass then I will go home 
 I might be open but I hope I ain't goin' capone 
 I got a shoulda to cry on when ya hurt 
 Right afta you done did yo mutha fuckin' dirt 
 The time ain't not fit the crime 
 But suicide's not the key 
 Reachin' out to my brothas an othas jus like me 
 Somebody lend me a shoulda to cry on 
 Lay ya head on me 
 I'll be right there where you neeeeed 
 Somebody lend me a shoulda to cry on 
 Lay ya head on me 
 I'll be right there where you neeeeed 
 I'm right here in yo face wid a lendin hand 
 Prison brings the bitch out the toughest man 
 But you try not to show it, claimin you claustrophobic 
 Convicted can't kick it an when the lights cut off you know it 
 And gang bangas gettin' played out some niggas can't let go 
 An sit up in they cell laid out 
 Yo life's a constant lesson and everything you wanna do you gotta ask permission 
 Hated to where you livin' ima drink it (all for dark?) down to the suds 
 I got green leaves for (thick stuff?) when I roll up buds 
 An get fucked up 
 For (brad code jack?) an others all of 'em black brothers 
 Hold ya head mothafuckas 
 My dream is to rap and show you that I care 
 This song might bring you to tears but life ain't fair 
 Just be on God's side, an pray to our law 
 To forgive you for your wrong doins before you die 
 Oh why, tell me why, gotta be like this 
 Judges holdin' grudges fuck that shit 
 Be kins instead of seekin' for revenge 
 Police ain't no beast till yo ass die in 
 Cryin through hell less mah cell get locked 
 We in jail so this muthafucka gon get rocked 
 For rock is there a heaven for a convicted felon 
 Ain't no muthafuckin tellin' I wish I could ask my ('cause an friend jeff?) 
 Somebody lend me a shoulda to cry on 
 Lay ya head on me 
 I'll be right there where you neeeeed
