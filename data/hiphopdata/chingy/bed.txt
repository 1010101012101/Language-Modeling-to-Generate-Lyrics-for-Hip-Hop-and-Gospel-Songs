 Uh huh, all right, yes, my body's yours tonight 
 Anything that you need, you can have it from me 
 Cause baby I'm here to please, so put your love into me 
 I know you like when I tease like that (like that) like that, especially when I'm at 
 Don't stop, ooh I like what you're doing so please don't move 
 Never met a man that turns me on like you do, 
 Oh oh oh 
 Bed (remix) 
 I love it, I love it, you love it, you love it, 
 Everytime, every time, we touchin', we touchin', 
 I want it, I want it, you want it, you want it, 
 I'll see you, see you in the morning, in the morning 
 Wanna put my fingers through your hair 
 Wrap me up in your legs 
 And love you till your eyes roll back 
 I'm tryna put you to bed, bed, bed 
 I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed

 Touchin' me like it's our first time 
 I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed

 I'm starin' at you while you're sleep 
 Irreplaceable beauty 
 Put my face up in your neck and breathe (ooh, breathe) 
 Take you into my senses 
 Wake up it's time to finish 
 Round two, round two 
 Matter of fact, it's closer to three 
 She like, "how long I been sleep?" 
 Shawty kisses turn into the sweetest dreams 
 Like give it to me 
 And I can feel her tell me 
 "My angel, this is wonderful 
 Thanks for letting me bless ya" 
 Come down, fly right 
 Drift back into heaven 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 I love it, I love it, you love it, you love it, 
 Everytime, every time, we touchin', we touchin', 
 I want it, I want it, you want it, you want it,

 Wanna put my fingers through your hair 
 Wrap me up in your legs 
 And love you till your eyes roll back 
 I'm tryna put you to bed, bed, bed 
 I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed 
 Then you can rock my body 
 Turn me over 
 Love is war, you're my soldier 
 Touchin' me like it's our first time 
 I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed 
 I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed 
 Watch the sunlight peak over the horizon 
 Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh 
 The sun ain't the only thing that's shinin' 
 Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
