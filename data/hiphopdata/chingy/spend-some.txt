 You a material girl, in a material world. 
 A celebrity chick, that wants diamonds and pearls. 
 Naw, I don't mind doing for you in public, you let me touch it and rub it, 
 But I don't love you (Aw no) 
 I let her drive the whip, 
 Stay over, call her girlfriends to my house and let 'em lay. (Oh Yeah) 
 Take her where she want, when she want, but don't get it twisted, the girl no her do's and don'ts. 
 My mama likes her, pops dig her. 
 Damn near took eight months just to hit her (No nigga) 
 When we go out, we take pictures 
 She bad, lil' dirty, around my homies, I kiss her 
 And y'all know that ain't me, fo' sho' that ain't me 
 Oh, it's 'bout dough, and that's me (Money, Money) 
 My ride or die girl going hard, I spend it on her since the cash flow flowing hard.
