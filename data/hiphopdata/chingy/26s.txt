 Chingy 
 I'm the wrong balla to flex with 
 Diamond stud earings and neckless 
 And my truck on 26's driving reckless 
 Got a pound yep and on my way to Texas 
 Yep I'm on there trowing up my set shit 
 Spinnas with the color trim ho's breathless 
 Paint shinning brite like morning breakfast 
 Once I slide up in the party pull the best fits 
 Yo chick still want me even though she pregnant 
 Run game on a trick like check this 
 She seen the atm recipt and got and got wet with shit 
 She in a lexus told her park her whip 
 270 I'm bout to exit 
 I can bet a grip she work her hands and lips 
 Like a porno star who cares if her man a trip 
 I can handle it it's so scandelous
