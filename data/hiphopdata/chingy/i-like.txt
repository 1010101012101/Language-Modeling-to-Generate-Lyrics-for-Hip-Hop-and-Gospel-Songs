(Feat. Lloyd) 
 (Chorus: Lloyd) 
 I, I love the colorful clothes you wear 
 And the way the sunlight plays upon your hair 
 I hear the sound of a gentle rain 
 On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air 
 (Chingy Talkin') 
 What's up lil mama 
 You know I been peepin you out right 
 You look good 
 I'm just tryn to get to know ya 
 It ain't like that 
 Why don't you come round 
 Give me your number 
 We can talk later on 
 You down with that? 
 In the hood where I met ya 
 See I didn't wanna sweat ya 
 Though I knew I had to catch ya 
 Determined that's why I met ya 
 My homies on you too 
 So they say I can't get ya 
 Yeah I know I can cause them fools too disrespectful 
 Your swags stay on point, you pass by me I gotta check ya 
 Just tryna chat lil mama no need to give you a lecture 
 Maybe happiness wake up in the morning with bed and breakfast 
 With rose petals no pressure attached with a love letter (ya dig?) 
 I keep ya blushing 'bout the walk off so I guess 
 Heard this once before but them lames I don't stand next to 
 Just see the signs from god 
 I could be the one to bless ya 
 Turn your life around (yeah) 
 I'm different from all the rest of them fools who run game just to get in your frame 
 I'm the type of guy who give it to you good say your name 
 I test ya because I feel it's a spark in this 
 I'm not gon waste your time 
 So baby I'm a start with this 
 Lloyd 
 (Chorus: Lloyd) 
 I, I love the colorful clothes you wear 
 And the way the sunlight plays upon your hair 
 I hear the sound of a gentle rain 
 On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air [x2] 
 (Chingy: Talkin') 
 So what's goin' 
 You think me and you can can get out later on 
 Baby look here 
 I ain't know how to bullshit 
 I'm just tryin' to get to know you 
 Take you out 
 Feel you out 
 Give you the finer things that you probably never had 
 That's all I'm hurr to do 
 Can you dig that 
 No, I know I know I know you probably been hurt a couple times 
 That ain't why I'm hurr 
 I'm hurr to make sure you don't get hurt 
 You understand 
 I'm a put the cards in your hand 
 Whatever you wanna do, I'm down to do too 
 Holla at me 
 I seen you round a couple times 
 I was with a couple dimes 
 And damn you so fine 
 I had to drop a couple lines 
 But your friends say he a rapper 
 They no good pay him no mind 
 If there's something good in your face hold on to it don't be blind 
 I sturr at you in the club so I sent you a glass of wine 
 I'm just tryna show you love get with me girl and we could shine 
 See I practice what I preach 
 I could take you out the streets 
 Have you travelin round the globe stayin at seven star suites 
 Lloyd 
 (Verse 3: Lloyd) 
 Since fried by the sun rays 
 That there was a rainy day 
 This one's shinin so fine 
 I'm just on a one way 
 Lookin' for a pretty place 
 Pretty face has some big thighs 
 The words that you can say 
 That can never change the way 
 That I feel on the inside 
 You can try to get a life 
 Civilized, stop livin' trife 
 Every time that you pass by [x2] 
 Lloyd, talk to her for me 
 Lloyd, talk to her for me dirty 
 That's right, that's right 
 I told you I'm hurr for you baby, it's really real 
 So when you ready to do this 
 Holla at me girl (yeah yeah)
