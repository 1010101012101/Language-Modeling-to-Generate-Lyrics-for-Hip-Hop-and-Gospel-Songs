 I'm in a 300 C beatin' down ya block 
 I keep my hoodies with me and that thing cocked 
 Gotta respect the dead so they ?? (rest in peace) 
 I'm always draped in dimonds it shouldn't be a shock 
 It's all eyes on me but I ain't too hot 
 See the ? behind me, they in two blocks 
 Girl I jerk off on the bed, that's a do hot 
 Girl I skirt off on ya, That's a do NOT 
 This the number one git it boys from the slot 
 If I don't like yer rap tats I'ma take a shot 
 Y'all needs some whips on lease man I take a lot 
 Shake the spot on the music up and break the box 
 Hit it crackin' the party and yet I git it happening 
 It happens from ballin I got digits and fractions 
 It's my actions accountable for stackin 
 Right up, this ain't fight night but I'm the main attraction 
 That's my show, 24's 
 Hit that thang when I blow 
 Drink it in and shut my door 
 But ya can't get in 
 Unless ya take off them clothes

 You couldn't see the colors in my stones with Binoklas 
 I'm the bricks in the street that break 'em all proper 
 Mo Money, Mo Power, the word the big pappa 
 The police act like? 
 But they ain't even ??????? 
 Ya boy can't help it see the thang? 
 Ya pull out ya best, bet I still top ya 
 Better still bet I will let the grill partner 
 Better chill, bitter steel, bet I will pop ya

 A coupla million saved up so I can floss later (floss later)

 Get out the pie honey bye oportunitic
