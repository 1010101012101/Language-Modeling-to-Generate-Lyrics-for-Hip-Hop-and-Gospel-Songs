Now you done been around the world, 
 And you'd seen alot of girls, 
 But, you ain't neva seen a girl look so fly like, 
 Now you done rolled through some hoods,

 Baby, But chu never had a girl look so fly like me.

 Er color, er shape, what I need and all, 
 Switch like seasons, when the summers, spring, & fall, 
 And back seat of my jeep, I'm chrome veet and all. 
 On the hunt for these girls were like my day to day, 
 I get 'em alone I jump 'em and den fade away, 
 I give it good so some of them wont stay away, 
 They try to lock me up, but I break away. 
 And to the day I lay my eyes on the princess, 
 And yu can tell she was a dime from a distance, 
 It took a minute to come to my senses, 
 She's the perfect match and god is my witness, 
 Now for the first time I've opened my eyes, 
 Put the glass in the air, now I toast to the sky, 
 Feels like I'm in heaven, & I'm hoping to fly, 
 Baby girl come along for the ride, yu know why cuhs i...

 And buy houses from the lou, to the A-Town,
