 Then I drop the top 
 You know ching a ling gon' make it hot 
 Let's ride 
 Girl I got it locked 
 Shut the club down when I hit the spot 
 Ain't no secret I'm doin' it baby 
 If I like what I see I'm pursuin it maybe 
 But a nasty attitude that could ruin it lady 
 If it's all gravy hop in and (lets ride) 
 And we can cruise a lil bit 
 Wild out and act like fools a lil bit 
 My whip ain't old girl this that new shit

 A couple big faces what you jiggle it for
