 You know it ain't for us 
 You know they think we dangerous 
 Even with no thangs to bust 
 They wanna keep puttin' chains to us 
 That's why I constantly sang and cuss 
 And when I bring it it's a gang of fuss 
 They tryin' to send us out to bang for bucks 
 They must be off of that angel dust, so check it out 
 Get that monkey off your back 
 Get that monkey off your back

 I'm an instigator 
 Mashin' out or in the scraper 
 And you can listen at me now or later 
 But stop givin' them pimps your paper 
 Used to be caught up in them capers 
 Havin' to hustle, rustle up my status 
 They beat my yellow ass purple like the Lakers 
 More like the Clippers 'cause they tryin' to fade us, now holla wit me 
 Get that monkey off your back 
 Get that monkey off your back 
 Get that monkey 
 Get that monkey 
 Get that monkey off your back 
 Get that monkey off your back

 Get that monkey off your back boy 
 Get that monkey off your back girl 
 Get that monkey off your back 
 A'ight we finally gots new momentum 
 Let's fill the fridge up in the kitchen 
 It's lotsa pots for cookin D-boy chicken 
 But we still ain't got one to piss in 
 They say I'm always fittin' the description 
 Of selling unprescribed prescriptions 
 But it's them with the green addiction 
 Think we gon' have to shake 'em off and keep dippin, so sing along 
 Get that monkey off your back 
 Get that monkey off your back 
 Get that monkey 
 Get that monkey 
 Get that monkey off your back 
 Get that monkey off your back 
 Get that monkey off your back 
 Get that monkey 
 Get that monkey

 Get that monkey off your back boy 
 Get that monkey off your back girl 
 Get that monkey off your back 
 Get that monkey off your back boy

 "Get your foot off my neck!" 
 "Get your foot off my neck!"
