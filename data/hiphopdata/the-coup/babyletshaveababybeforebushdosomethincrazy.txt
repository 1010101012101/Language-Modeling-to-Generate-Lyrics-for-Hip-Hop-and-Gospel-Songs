Baby, let's have a baby 
 Before Bush do somethin' crazy 
 Baby, let's have a baby 
 Before Bush do some, somethin' crazy 
 I don't want the world to blow 
 Before we get a chance to let our love grow 
 I don't want the world to blow 
 Before we get a chance to let our love grow 
 I don't really wanna fuss and fight 
 Baby, we might have numbered nights 
 We might never get our money right 
 We could take off this patch tonight 
 Bombs goin' off everywhere 
 The police got me runnin' scared 
 But I still got love to share 
 Plus you know I stopped smokin' squares 
 Baby, let's have a baby 
 Before Bush do somethin' crazy
