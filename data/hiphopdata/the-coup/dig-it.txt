Presto, read the Communist Manifesto 
 Guerrillas in tha Mist, a Guevara named Ernesto, so 
 (What a brother with a afro know?) 
 Yo, go and flow for the mack and be the hoe 
 So grow 'cause the lynchin' brothers might get hung 
 Better rip through em from the tip of my mouth say tongue 
 Deficit (money spent), catch the glint 
 (Of my nine as they cut welfare twenty-five percent) 
 And I dissent, as I clench and raise my fist 
 (We did away with that) So you could get with this 
 Here's a twist 'cause we're overthrown like Kwame Nkrumah 
 Spread around the wealth as if it were a vicious rumor 
 Pam, cuts a record like a surgeon cuts a tumor from a brain 
 (We're all cooped up, so feel the pain) 
 From four hundred years of exploitation 
 Anesthesia provided by your local TV station 
 Patience is not a virtue (I ain't waitin') 
 Turn this shit over like Bush did a boatload of Haitians 
 (Dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it) 
 (D-dig it, dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it) 
 (D-dig, dig, dig, dig it) 
 How now brown cow, I'm down with the Mau Mau 
 Clown downtown tried to put us in the dog pound 
 Like H. Rap Brown with the situation 
 (Won't get no callouses) 'cause I'm spittin' dialectical analysis 
 So how is this, we never had no funk 
 Until you found out that I turned to revolutionary, huh 
 (Chump) Bump you over like dominoes, rat 
 (So free Geronimo Gi Jaga Pratt) 
 Lyrics, hear it, fear it, can't get near it 
 Got a sample, didn't clear it 
 Point blank says, "Fuck five-0!" That's the spirit 
 Cheer it, spat out, the fat that I consumed 
 Knew that I was doomed since my date of birth 
 To be the wretched of the earth 
 Never had a dream that was American 
 (The golden leg to the chair again) Despair again 
 (But that ain't nothin' new) Told the streets were paved with gold 
 Whoever paved that shit got minimum wage too 
 (Dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it, dig it, dig) 
 (Dig it, dig it) 
 (D-dig, dig, dig, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it) 
 Do you understand the metaphoric phrase? 
 Do you understand the metaphoric phrase? 
 Do you understand the metaphoric phrase? 
 Do you understand? Do you understand? 
 (Gunned us, stunned us) exploited and they hung us 
 I'd like to take a moment to say, "Fuck Columbus!" 
 (Millions off my back) The black on black crisis is a myth 
 The crack that did this to us (was the one from the whip) 
 The record skip, the record skip, the record skip 
 The record skips, 'cause my voice is kinda scratchy 
 From yelling, "Oh shit!" when five-0 comes to harass me 
 They never pass me, no one to go and tail bro 
 (Trying to kill the movement with the new COINTELPRO) 
 Leaders they killed, if I said it, it would threaten 'em 
 They only see my back because I'm three steps ahead of 'em 
 We're not fallin' in the slot you slated 
 (We realize that our power's nickel-plated) 
 Masses move as well as asses do, class is through 
 Our time is over, past it's due 
 (And you still wanna know) the origin of the flow 
 Oakland, California 94610 
 (Dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it, dig it) 
 (Yeah, The Coup, comin' at you in '93) 
 Yeah, and we out y'all 
 (Dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it) 
 (Dig it, dig it, dig it)
