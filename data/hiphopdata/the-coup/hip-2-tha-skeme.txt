Make it one, make it two, make it three 
 Right before it happens 
 Make it four, make it five, make it six 
 Make it seven, make it eight, make it nine, ten 
 Come on motherfucka, we can do it again 
 Make it one, make it two, make it three 
 Right before it happens 
 Make it four, make it five, make it six 
 Make it seven, make it eight, make it nine, ten 
 Come on motherfucka, we can do it again 
 See I ain't never had shit but  my strife and my game and my life 
 And all thems is just hand downs from my granddaddy Lidvens 
 For them whose black folks ever came to steal 
 And hustling food stamps for that nine to four caddy 
 How many days can I stretch this box of grits 
 Shit never quits, I'm a brother pitching fits or pitching shit 
 I use my mouth or a leg muscle, anything to make the rent 
 Yo, you know the hustle 
 I know the US economy and I could run it 
 I'm 'bout to make these four dollars into four hundred 
 Ain't nothing happening but this serious game 
 While they got billions in the bank, we just got money on the deck 
 And when we got fresh rims, we on top 
 On top of what? When the kitchen table's on hock 
 Gun uncocked but we seen it on the past 
 Make a fast dash for the cash be gangsta leaning on your ass 
 $20s and $10s, it's all about making ends 
 No need to sin to uplift a California living 
 But I'd rear 'cause err I remember as a tot 
 Was the OGs skank you mothafuckas with the glocks 
 And now the rocks is in my pockets 
 And my spots hot like the Hawaiian tropics 
 A task force topic 'cause this one's a CYA 
 Even though the yay is brought in by the CIA 
 See I'm a mothafucka that's done some dirt for my meal ticket 
 But I've learned quick you gots to deal with it 
 Well, I dealed for twenty-two fucking years 
 You damn straight my homies been laid when we all shed tears 
 And it's clear to my ear, I had to learn that knowledge 
 'Cause after 12th grade I had to say, 
 "Fuck college" 
 And the knowledge, no longer will I waste my time 
 The chrome was stuck in my ear, but I'm stuck to the grind 
 I'm steady mobbin' back to the police station 
 They checkin' me but it's inflation, that's doin this takin' 
 No hesitatin', can't be waitin', let me do my thing 
 I was hooked like a fiend, but now I'm hip 2 tha skeme 
 Make it one, make it two, make it three 
 Right before it happens 
 Make it four, make it five, make it six 
 Make it seven, make it eight, make it nine, ten 
 Come on motherfucka, we can do it again 
 Make it one, make it two, make it three 
 Right before it happens 
 Make it four, make it five, make it six 
 Make it seven, make it eight, make it nine, ten 
 Come on motherfucka, we can do it again 
 I heard recognized game when it's in your face 
 I'm spitting the game so close to you, you could feel the wet trace 
 If everybody in the hood had a PHD 
 You'd say that doctor, 
 "Flip that burger. Hell, it good for me." 
 200,000 brothers watching one mind, one place to go 
 Ain't no revolution, they just walking to the liquor store 
 Here, take a swagger, so its quicker 'round the niggerroe 
 Just wanna get rich, the rigmarole, I been here before 
 A typical ho, ain't really no different 
 Except that she would know that can't no prostitute become a pimp up in this system 
 It'd be more drama than a soap opera daytime spot 
 But ain't no twist up in this cemetery plot 
 Since 1954, I's been hustling for that dough 
 My girl been putting out cross that wick like she's a specialized pro 
 This shit is getting steep, I'm getting ill ready to kill 
 The only thing I can inherit is an overdue bill 
 Now it's six in the morning, I stride to the ride 
 As I glide down the street, I can't get to park 'cause my gas is kissing heat 
 I'm not yet free, but you don't hear me though 
 Unless you creeping soap past my drive through window 
 Now if you wondering 'bout my fucked up fickle frown 
 Is 'cause I'm thinking 'bout how the wealth don't trickle down 
 Listen to that beat nickle pound is my homies in the back 
 Pass the nickle bag around and I'm looking at the street 
 Through the fogged up windows knew if I was walking 
 I'd be smelling stench or piss or stale pussy in your window 
 I ask when those stores get closed down 
 A system that eats itself got it looking like a ghost town 
 No proof of purchase hear my essence purchase proof 
 Analyze how they fucked us like if I was Dr. Ruth 
 I'm on proof with the truth they started with nothing 
 Robbed and ganked and killed 
 Ain't no po' folks getting rich, 'lest some caps is getting picked 
 'Cept for a couple of mothafuckas who done live their token 
 Seen lifestyles of the rich and famous, front page of the magazine 
 But that's a known trick, tell them suck their own dick 
 I'm hip 2 tha skeme, my fist will bring up the whole clique 
 Make it one, make it two, make it three 
 Right before it happens 
 Make it four, make it five, make it six 
 Make it seven, make it eight, make it nine, ten 
 Come on motherfucka, we can do it again 
 Make it one, make it two, make it three 
 Right before it happens 
 Make it four, make it five, make it six 
 Make it seven, make it eight, make it nine, ten 
 Come on motherfucka, we can do it again
