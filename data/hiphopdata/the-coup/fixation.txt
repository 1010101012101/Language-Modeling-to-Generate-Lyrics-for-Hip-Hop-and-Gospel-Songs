Well this is verbal penetration, 
 Alert your school administration, 
 If you act like a dick castration, 
 It just brings me elation, 
 Your misleading presentation, 
 Was just boring oration, 
 Gun claps from my tech will be your standing ovation, 
 Beat-per-minute calculations, 
 Match aorta computations, 
 Which speed up if you eat that greasy deification at Nation's, 
 Tear along the perforation, 
 Means collection notification, 
 And you know I stack my scrilla in negative denominations, 
 And that's a damn abomination, 
 It takes all my concentration, 
 To not rob armored transportation, 
 And collect compensation, 
 But it takes contemplation, conspiration, 
 Conversation, and propagation, 
 Information dissemination, and tribulations no hesitation, 
 Indoctrination, affiliation, penitentiary and jail evasion, 
 For liberation and publications, 
 Spell "THE COUP" with capitalizations. 
 I was on the verge of ejaculation, 
 Police performed a home evasion, 
 So I cut off the illumination, 
 And jumped up out of the ventilation, 
 They were in anticipation, 
 Waiting in Voltron formation, 
 So I performed circumnavigation, 
 And then crawled through the foliation, 
 Started my legs to gyration, 
 Caught me, took me to the station, 
 Valuables confiscation, started the interrogation, 
 Told 'em I don't know 'bout this organization, 
 Causing business complications, 
 Said they wanted pacification, 
 I said I know all yo machinations, 
 What you want more exploitation? 
 You gets no respect, no information, 
 One mo' thang fo' yo gestation, 
 Think you should try self-fornication!
