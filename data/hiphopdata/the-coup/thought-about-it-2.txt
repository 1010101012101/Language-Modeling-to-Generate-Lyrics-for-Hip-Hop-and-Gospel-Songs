Have you thought about it too? Have you ever? 
 Because we are here for you 
 When you have nothing to lose 
 All the people feel it too 
 Have you thought about it too? 
 Because we are here for you 
 When you have nothing to lose 
 All the people feel it too 
 You do have a way out, baby 
 And together we can breath free air 
 Have you thought about it too? 
 Because we are here for you 
 When you have nothing to lose 
 All the people feel it too 
 I know they wanna isolate you, yeah 
 Give you nothing to relate to, yeah 
 We're gonna have to break this whole mother fucker down 
 So loneliness, don't let it overtake you no 
 When you feel so all alone 
 Know you have a home
