I ain't seen shit, I ain't heard nothing 
 I don't know what happen, I don't speak Pig Latin 
 I am a motherfucking true when its us against you, so 
 Fuck Starsky, Hutch and Inspector Clouseau 
 I was taught don't rely on pigs for protection 
 Shit, I try not to even ask 'em for directions 
 You're in the wrong section of the hood for a crime to be inspected 
 Got this block infected 
 You could get ejected, expect it 
 Ain't no love, if you're the fuzz, I mean, the fizz, I mean 
 My daddy told me who you was, I mean the wiz, I mean, you can't win 
 Ease on down the road, we got a don't-talk-to-cops-code 
 I won't fold, working for the man with the electric chair 
 That's why I never watched Roberta and I hated Huggy Bear 
 Even Scooby-Doo snitched with that hippy-ass van 
 But me I know the scoop I know the plan 
 Ask me no questions I tell you no lies 
 You know the deal, the real criminals who dressed in suit and ties 
 Who holds the wealth you do more damage than health 
 So for me and my folks we finna just do for self 
 I don't know shit about them stolen goods 
 You want peace motherfucker, raise up out tha hood 
 I think you should, "no" is all I'm gonna say 
 To get that 4-1-1 you better go ask Mary J. 
 E-Roc do not play when there's pigs in town, clown 
 Tryin' looking up Encyclopedia Brown 
 That's when he frown, asking who's selling herb 
 I got disturbed, fool, I'm not your mockingbird 
 The only words coming out of my mouth is a lyrical thang 
 So please back tha fuck up off my screen, tho 
 Since I was four you was known to be the enemy 
 Like Rin Tin Tin, you only give a shit for me 
 The community took four steps higher 
 86ing motherfuckas working for the suppliers 
 So sayonara, before you catch a cap in your ass 
 No more questions in here, so don't ask 
 You want peace motherfucka, raise up out the hood 
 (get it) 
 You want peace motherfucka, raise up out the hood 
 (get it) 
 You want peace motherfucka, raise up out the hood 
 (get it) 
 You want peace motherfucka, raise up out the hood 
 (get it) 
 Well all the tattletalers and undercover dwellers 
 They are here to be placed into helicopter propellers 
 And the narcotic snatched up by the seat of his pants 
 His face was driven into a hill of army ants 
 The man had the murder for his Benz and his face 
 I never saw the assailant, he vanished through the mist 
 "You know the faces and names all your stories are polluted. 
 Tell me the truth before I have you electrocuted." 
 Attempting on my person wouldn't be the wise thing 
 In your thoughts you have fear of my people's uprisings 
 The masses rebel your aircraft propels 
 A cop was shot seven rounds were expelled 
 Went straight right to hell just for being a fascist 
 Burned uniforms and piles of human ashes 
 "Your making this difficult so for being a bastard, 
 I'll have you charged for murderer and resisting arrest." 
 I never did resist, you're telling false myths 
 He's swung with the sticks so I made a spinal column twist 
 One came with a body blow to osaygefo and 
 He struck my abdominals and fractured his hand 
 Rebels away through the twigs blasted their wigs 
 And there you will find a red ocean of pigs 
 Stay away from my zone where it starts and it ends 
 That's how we murder policemen up on Planet 10 
 Step into this 8 x 10, I'm getting nervous 
 You feel me point blank yo I feel the coppers came to serve us 
 But now here he comes stepping through the fucking door 
 And we don't know who smoked that motherfucking cop at the liquor store 
 But now you creep through the hood looking for a clue 
 But your bob head twice with the point blank crew 
 Running up my bumper for late registration 
 Taking me to that station for interrogation 
 And I guess I'm just supposed to just let my tongue run 
 Asking me shit that would get my mother hung 
 But where I'm from up in my hood the shit won't raise 
 If a brother is constantly tripping that would be his ass 
 But now you wanna creep up on me and threaten me with time 
 While you got the billy club pointed at my spine 
 With things nowadays aint the same like they used to be 
 Doing time for contempt aint new to me 
 I never feared going down with my whole damn crew 
 Only thing that I fear is ever fucking with you 
 Well I too took a beating from the boys in blue 
 And all cops watched like a pay per view 
 And unless you're referring to this incident 
 We don't know nothing and we ain't seen shit 
 (Get it) 
 You want peace motherfucka, raise up out the hood 
 (get it) 
 You want peace motherfucka, raise up out the hood 
 (get it) 
 You want peace motherfucka, raise up out the hood 
 (get it) 
 You want peace motherfucka, raise up out the hood 
 (get it)
