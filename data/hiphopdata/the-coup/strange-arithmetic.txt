Uh, uh, uh 
 History has taught me some strange arithmetic 
 Using swords, prison bars and pistol grips 
 English is the art of bombing towns 
 While assuring that you really only blessed the ground 
 Science is that honorable, useful study 
 Where you contort the molecules and then you make that money 
 In mathematics, dead children don't get added 
 But they count the cost of bullets comin' out the automatic 
 And um, teacher, my hand's up 
 Please, don't make me a victim 
 Teachers, stand up 
 You need to tell us how to flip this system 
 Teacher, my hand's up 
 Please, don't make me a victim 
 Teachers, stand up 
 You need to tell us how to flip this system, drop 
 Economics is the symphony of hunger and theft 
 Mortar shells often echo out the cashing of checks 
 In geography class, it's borders, mountains and rivers 
 But they will never show the line between the takers and givers 
 Algebra is that unique occasion 
 In which a school can say that there should be a balanced equation 
 And then statistics is the tool of the complicit 
 To say everybody's with it and that you're the only critic 
 And um, teacher, my hand's up 
 Please, don't make me a victim 
 Teachers, stand up 
 Tell us how to flip this system 
 Teacher, my hand's up 
 Please, don't make me a victim 
 Teachers, stand up 
 Tell us how to flip this system, move 
 Social studies is the Goliath to tackle 
 Which turns into a sermon on simplicity of shackles 
 Physics is to school you on the science of force 
 'Cept for how to break the hell out the ghetto, of course 
 Home Ec can teach you how to make a few sauces 
 And accept low pay from your Wal-Mart bosses 
 If your school won't show you how to fight for what's needed 
 Then they're training you to go through life and get cheated 
 And um, teacher, my hand's up 
 Please, don't make me a victim 
 Teachers, stand up 
 You need to tell us how to flip this system 
 Teacher, my hand's up 
 Please, don't make me a victim 
 Teachers, stand up 
 You need to tell us how to flip this system, grow
