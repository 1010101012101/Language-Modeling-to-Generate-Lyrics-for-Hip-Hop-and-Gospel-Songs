Black Thought 
 Move, if you got the nerve 
 Lash out for your just desserts 
 It's not just the worth 
 Some of y'all heads up in the clouds 
 I'ma bring y'all back to earth 
 It's Black back to burn 
 Bullshit y'all talkin' 'bout 
 Out ya mouth, I'm not concerned 
 'Cause y'all got to learn 
 It's y'all turn like Detroit Red 
 When his head had a Ultra Perm 
 The long walk'll burn your bare heels 
 So throw on your boots 
 The game camouflaged like army suits 
 But I can see it more clear 
 'Cause I came with The Coup in here 
 Ring the alarm and form the troops 
 Send 'em out into the world 
 Go to war in a fluke 
 Eye to eye with the enemy you sworn to shoot 
 Now comin' at ya neck sick o' hearin' 
 Something wrong with me 
 Motherfucker somethin' wrong with you 
 When the chief just way too smart to question 
 The enemy the brothers of a dark complexion 
 The governments of the world is shark infested 
 They heavy on weaponry like Charlton Heston 
 Man, yeah it gets low here uh, real low 
 Know what I'm talkin' 'bout? 
 I ain't rockin' with you, so what what you goin' do? 
 It's my favorite mutiny 
 I ain't rockin' with you, your logic does not compute 
 It's my favorite mutiny 
 Boots Riley 
 Death to the pigs is my basic statement 
 I spit street stories till I taste the pavement 
 Tryin' to stay out the pen where we face enslavement 
 Had a foolproof hustle till they traced the payments 
 I was grippin' my palm around some shitty rum 
 Tryin' to find psalm number 151 
 To forget what I'm owed, as I clutch the commode 
 I read "Put down the bottle and come get the gun" 
 Let's get off the chain like Kunta Kinte with a MAC-10 
 They want us gone like a dollar in a crack den 
 Steadily subtractin' seeds and stems 
 Mind cloudy through the wheeze and phlegm 
 Numbin' my brain off of that and the Jesus hymns 
 If we waiting for the time to fight, these is thems 
 Tellin' us to relax while they ease it in 
 We gettin' greased again 
 The truth I write is so cold, it'd freeze my pen 
 I'm Boots Riley it's a pleasure to meet you 
 Never let they punk ass ever defeat you 
 They got us on the corner wearin pleather and see through 
 All y'all's gold mines, they wanna deplete you 
 I ain't just finna rap on the track, I finna clap on 'em back 
 And it's been stackin' to that 500 years before Iceberg 
 Ever leaned back in the 'lac 
 Before they told Rosa "Black in the back" 
 Before the CIA told Ricky Ross to put crack in a sack 
 And Gil Scott traded rappin' for smack 
 This beat alone should get platinum plaques 
 I'd rather see a million of us ecstatic to scrap 
 'Cause if we bappin' 'em back we automatically stack 
 I ain't rockin' with you, so what what you goin' do? 
 It's my favorite mutiny 
 I ain't rockin' with you, your logic does not compute 
 It's my favorite mutiny 
 Talib Kweli 
 This the cut like truancy 
 Riq, Boots and me 
 Activatin' the community 
 Up in the bay like Huey P, they sucka free 
 It remind me of the BK, it's love for me 
 But beast got it twisted 
 I'll untangle it 
 Black mind intertwined like the ropes they used to hang us with 
 This is my favorite shit 
 I came in the game with a new way to spit 
 That got questionin' who you bangin' with? 
 Take it back to Imhotep 
 I'll go a step deeper like a poor righteous teacher with holy intellect 
 Killer flow for all my real niggaz left 
 But inform the family of a jiggaboo that there's been a death 
 Once again you can feel hip-hop 
 Underground, still about my guap 
 Gangsta like, fuck the cops 
 Talib Kweli revolutionary MC 
 And that ain't about to stop 
 I ain't rockin' with you, so what what you goin' do? 
 It's my favorite mutiny 
 I ain't rockin' with you, your logic does not compute 
 It's my favorite mutiny
