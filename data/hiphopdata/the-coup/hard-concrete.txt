While growing up in the ghetto, my time went fast 
 See I be stealing from the grown ups, running from the tasks 
 As I dash through the grass everyday, skipping class 
 My daddy don't be tripping, so you can kiss my ass 
 Pass the dougie doobie left hand side 
 Only nine years old getting high, getting high 
 I wonder why my teacher's sweating me, I did my history 
 It don't relate to me, my GPA 1.3 
 See I remember places, the names, streets, dates 
 Anybody rolling with stolen license plates 
 But if that faked out-of-date shit wasn't in my way 
 Ask me anything or where I'm from, I bet I get an A minus 
 In fact I am the finest 
 Counting male faster than you can say, "Your highness" 
 Don't combat me with dryness 
 'Cause I know the definition of any slang word 
 So what's that synonym you're wishing? 
 I want to be a lawyer 
 Accused of a liar like LaToya 
 So I'm dropping the fourth grade, slinging lemonade 
 I am my own keeper, a young overachiever 
 Ten cents a cup, I'm a gonna have to leave that shit to Beaver 
 Now I lay me down to sleep 'cause I can't eat my noodles right 
 Dead bodies every other night, we fucking up the appetite 
 Tragedy is an everyday thing 
 Put on a video game, sip some Tang, if I can't stand the pain 
 Give me the knowledge from the street, now watch me learn it 
 I went to get a job but too young for a work permit 
 Don't come my way (fool) I might just have to gack 
 They say we growing up fast, but we just dying faster 
 Always dropping the good or villain cop 
 Slam the child on the hard concrete 
 Always dropping the good or villain cop 
 Slam the child on the hard concrete 
 Always dropping the good or villain cop 
 Slam the child on the hard concrete 
 Always dropping the good or villain cop 
 Slam the child on the hard concrete 
 Well, it's June 17th, it couldn't have came to me no quicker 
 11 years old, my chest a little thicker 
 How you figger my life is gonna be bigger and better 
 When that path I'm rolling on is similar to that crooked letter 
 Once I get a better view to check out that avenue 
 It's drug infested planted there just for me to be tested 
 On the hard concrete, now it's three years later 
 Came for me literally, caught me up stacking that refrigerator 
 Catching Shirley down the block in the bucket 
 She stepped to the back that's when i stuck it, fuck it 
 My first piece of butt, it was just my luck 
 'Cause nine months later at my door she showed up 
 Damn, I was stuck, reminiscing in my seat 
 I just turned sixteen but to me it's not sweet 
 No edumaction, this combination of ghetto life 
 Is a strain, pass the Ben-Gay cream 
 Eighteen looking as old as Don King 
 The indo in my brain keep asking me 
 How many years is it until my life expectancy 
 Well let's see, another three done take away 
 And now the hustling games a part of me everyday 
 My life is on the line, fool you can catch my fist 
 'Cause any other place can be a better place than this 
 I'm now dismissed, my body hit the concrete 
 The bullet had no name as it was introduced to me 
 The next morning, headline front page 
 Young man shot 'cause of death: old age 
 Try to rise above it all 
 Or drown in 
 Always dropping the good or villain cop 
 Slam the child on the hard concrete 
 Always dropping the good or villain cop 
 Slam the child on the hard concrete 
 Always dropping the good or villain cop 
 Slam the child on the hard concrete 
 Always dropping the good or villain cop 
 Slam the child on the hard concrete 
 Man, this is really something
