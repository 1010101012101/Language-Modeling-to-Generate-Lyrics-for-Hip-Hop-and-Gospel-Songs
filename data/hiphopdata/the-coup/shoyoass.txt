Now's the time for you to showyoass 
 They ain't handin' out no mo' cash 
 Mommas imitate my logo fast 
 Daddies take the safety off and blast 
 Now's the time for you to showyoass 
 They ain't handin' out no mo' cash 
 Mommas imitate my logo fast 
 Daddies take the safety off and blast 
 Now this is mo' mean than fo' fiends with glocks unloading 
 Scrappin' for a bag of gold rings and codeine 
 Whole life savings hid under the molding 
 Mama said, "Knock them out" and I'm quoting 
 You're voting which you're hoping 
 Will stop the guns from smoking 
 Is someone fucking joking? 
 They're bonkers in sheep's clothing 
 I know places where the kids keep crooking 
 Lacking the essential vitamins and protein 
 Hustlin' and hyphy are eloping 
 I'm the best man bustin' shots and toasting 
 Sippin' Grey Goose get clipped off the bird 
 Come Sunday mornin' get tripped off the word 
 TV and them preachers got pimp talkin' verbs 
 Settin' us up to get ripped off and stirred 
 You flipped all them birds so your funds act right 
 Here come the drought whole thang's half price 
 My high school career counselor's advice 
 "Lil' niggaz act nice for your beans and rice" 
 I got some fight, baby, take it to the head 
 I gives a fuck if it's permed or in dreads 
 Never snitch to the locals or the feds 
 See they tryna break us off so they don't have to break bread 
 'Cause Uncle Same ain't the baker, he's the butcher 
 We all on punk'd with no Ashton Kutcher 
 Where ballin' no broke, cutthroats kaput ya 
 Ain't never took dope but them dopes done took ya 
 Stop flyin' ol' glory man, cut it down 
 If your job ain't payin' right, shut it down 
 If your cat got 18's, let it pound 
 And if we ever gon' do it let's do it now, see 
 Now's the time for you to showyoass 
 They ain't handin out no mo' cash 
 Mommas imitate my logo fast 
 Daddies take the safety off and blast 
 Now's the time for you to showyoass 
 They ain't handin out no mo' cash 
 Mommas imitate my logo fast 
 Daddies take the safety off and blast 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 You're in a system where they flirt with disaster 
 Tongue kiss death, have mass murder orgies till there's no one left 
 They're finger-fuckin' Lady Liberty under her dress 
 And since I didn't say this under my breath 
 I might be under arrest, now lemme introduce 
 My slave name's Ray Riley, you can call me Boots 
 'Cause we gon' boot 'em outta power then spread the loot 
 We need to drive that freedom train, not ride caboose 
 And you can tell by the way I walk my walk 
 That there's a coroner behind me holdin' chalk 
 'Cause he works for the county wh' off your plate 
 We ain't one dimensional, max-detentional 
 Lookin' for the liquor store, what them hubbas hittin' fo'? 
 We raised by the street light, praised for the street fight 
 Days we ain't eat right, hazed to complete life 
 Had to make homes outta muck and dirt 
 Just to get dinner take luck and work 
 They don't need my rights, they induct a curse 
 So you're cordially invited to go buck berserk and um 
 Now's the time for you to showyoass 
 They ain't handin out no mo' cash 
 Mommas imitate my logo fast 
 Daddies take the safety off and blast 
 Now's the time for you to showyoass 
 They ain't handin out no mo' cash 
 Mommas imitate my logo fast 
 Daddies take the safety off and blast 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 The black is heated, baby, yeah 
 A hundred Fahrenheit 
 Act a fool, showyoass 
 Let's make it alright 
 The black is heated, baby, yeah 
 A hundred Fahrenheit 
 Act a fool, showyoass 
 Let's make it alright 
 It's introduction of a new breed of leaders 
 Stand up, organize 
 It's introduction of a new breed of leaders 
 Stand up, organize
