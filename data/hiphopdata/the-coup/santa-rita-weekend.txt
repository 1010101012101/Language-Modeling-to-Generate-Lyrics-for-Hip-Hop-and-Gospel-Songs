(Geah) 
 Stepping up out of my cell with Santos and county blues 
 Handcuffs and shackles, gonna ride up on that Grey Goose 
 Coming out of a case 'cause I was strapped with my nine 
 They see these drawers that I'm wearing, muthafuckas, ain't mine, nigga 
 Excuse me, homie, can I hit that mista 
 Niggas blowing up in the while a toilet tissue 
 Ain't this a bitch, some niggas are scared to hear 
 Fool, I'm with it 
 So phone check, nigga, get the fuck off the line 
 Before I stick your ass in here and have to do some more time, playa 
 Want to give me the strap, 'cause I was strapped with a glock 
 I guess I got to sit my black ass right there and get shot, see 
 (fool) 
 But fool, it ain't no going out 
 See, I keep scoring clout and show these niggas, what I'm all about 
 See, niggas screaming from cell to cell 
 Snitches don't tell a party in hell at Santa Rita County Jail 
 Every time I turn around, every time I look 
 I'm considered to be a murderer, a crook 
 Ali shook the world, I'm gonna shake my homies hand 
 Three in the morning dressed in blue once again 
 My size ten rest upon the concrete floor 
 Heads bob real slow to a freestyle flow 
 I don't know this master plan, can't understand 
 Why there's more black folks in jail than Japanese in Japan 
 But err, my eyes pink, sitting upon that bunk 
 Thinking about them tickets, choking up on that funk chunk 
 Witcha a snicker from my commissary bank 
 Sunday, Monday came fool I'm out this home change 
 But it makes me think the systems treating us like a merry-go-round 
 One day you're chilling at home the next you headed down 
 Sam, peace to my hounds in the county in the pen 
 Once again, it's a Santa Rita weekend 
 Just sitting up on the top bunk 
 Watching the cell block row 
 (Geah) 
 Just sitting up on the top bunk 
 Watching the cell block row 
 (Geah) 
 Seven zero seven, case motherfucking number two eleven 
 Stressin', manifestin' tore up from the floor 
 Penelope's gots me on the floor 
 Accused of robbing a store who you know, nigga 
 Naybody? Besides which I refuse to answer any questions 
 Without the advisory of my lawyer Mr. Baker 
 Perming? of this wall and make let me go po po 
 I'm innocent mistaken, right 
 Suppose all blacks look alike 
 Thank you kindly sir you need to practice your professional 
 Better never run up on me again 
 Bust a pattern be off into the wind 
 Back up off me, bitch 
 Just the other day my cronies shot me up high 
 We warn you baby boy, you becoming hella tight 
 Clayback back a building up there by Dreno 
 Rita, Quentin, also Gino 
 Just sitting up on the top bunk 
 Watching the cell block row 
 Nah man, I didn't want the chorus right here 
 I wanna throw that right down there 
 You know, that bass line 
 (Geah) 
 It's like yeaoh, meao? weigh two scales 
 It don't mean shit when you'r sitting in the county jail 
 Is it my turn to tell the tale of how I got popped 
 And how my lawyer failed to get me out on the slight spot 
 My cell block, my homies give me love 
 Some here for having gacks, some here for selling drugs 
 Sometimes you do your shit and ain't no second tries 
 Look around, there's hella motherfuckas that I recognize 
 Oh what's up, man, I'm back again but its a temporary situation 
 Taking weekend vacation government incarceration 
 I call myself working on a pay hike 
 They calling me working on my third strike 
 Sike, I cant go forward 
 And motherfuckas can't ignore it, 'cause all my peoples on parole 
 In the pen gotta warrant so it's some shit I done leaped in 
 Damn, another Santa Rita weekend 
 Just sitting up on the top bunk 
 Watching the cell block row 
 (Geah) 
 Just sitting up on the top bunk 
 Watching the cell block row 
 (Geah) 
 (Geah) 
 (Geah)
