Come up, come up, come up man 
 Come up, come up, come up man 
 Come up, come up man 
 Come up, come up man 
 Get it up, I mean give it up, fool 
 Now give me those minerals and those jewels 
 Because it's me, the EOVA tech and I'm back with this jacket 
 Getting up on some products that I'm lacking 
 Well I'm that other ruthless type of brother 
 Oh you ain't heard about my antics? 
 Shit, I ran clicks through history that left the US frantic 
 Get us all romantic before they fucked us 
 Trying a hand trick with a glock 'fore they bust us 
 Four hundred years ago, fool, where is my gold? 
 The year is '94, black folks ain't taking it no more 
 We on the rise, The Coup is not the bad guys 
 You know, taking it from the rich, giving it back to the poor 
 So yo, put those dividends down on the floor and get real 
 I can't feed my family with a Happy Meal 
 To the rescue but not Lone Ranger with the lasso 
 I got the 9mm pointed at your asshole 
 Yo, so Mr. IBM, give it up smooth 
 'Cause this time more than your bowels gonna move 
 See, it's a family thing, so don't even trip 
 My cousin JD got the nine and my mama got the extra clip 
 So please, oh please, oh please 
 Give me them Nikes and free cheese 
 And, while you're on them knees 
 Break me off for my G's, 'cause 
 We are taking these if you please 
 (cheerio) 
 We are taking these if you don't please 
 (check it out) 
 We are taking these if you please 
 (cheerio) 
 We are taking these if you don't please 
 Knock knock, motherfucka, let me in 
 I just wanna kick it in your big ass den 
 And if you don't like it, take two to the chin 
 And show me to the kitchen 'cause my kids is getting thin 
 I don't have to talk shit about packing a gat, in fact 
 You could get fucked by any other motherfucker where I live at 
 Hear that money here is crystal clear, punk 
 Fuck that fiscal year junk, meet the pistol gripped punk 
 Pistol gripped punk, meet Mr. Rockefeller 
 We gonna take him out do him like Old Yeller 
 It's been too damn long this proper day mutual 
 That's why today, it won't be business as usual 
 Call me the repo man, I'mma make it equal and 
 I'mma get you if you play my little sequel can 
 I know you're down with the Klan, but you must understand 
 You did the crime, so now it's time to put this nine in my hand 
 So put the money in the bag and 86 the tricks 
 Don't forget to add grits with those afro picks 
 And free licks flowing fast, 'cause I ain't living fat 
 Boots, you got my back? Where the fuck you at? 
 I'm getting ammunition out the Pinto hatchback 
 Refer to this as Operation: Snatchback 
 'Cause I got the bullets and the hollow-tips to distribute equally 
 So who's the niggas, thugs and pimps you mention frequently? 
 Take me with frequency, now I know you got mail 
 And if my glock fails, take a sip of this Molotov cocktail 
 Oh, is that your Rolls Royce? Come off up them keys 
 'Cause we are taking these even if you don't please 
 We are taking these if you please 
 (cheerio) 
 We are taking these if you don't please 
 (check it out) 
 We are taking these if you please 
 (cheerio) 
 We are taking these if you don't please 
 How does it feel when you got no food? 
 Take out the supermarkets so the people wouldn't feel the move 
 How does it feel when you got no cash? 
 How you think it feel when your pockets singing "Make it last" 
 I choose to rock the boat instead of Rock the Vote 
 We threw the mayor's body in the bay to see if it would sink or float 
 You try to be the mac to me, you can't, we got agility 
 We taking factories, production plants and all facilities 
 We got a gang of motherfuckas who done eat their Wheaties 
 No peace treaties, you swimming in your own feces 
 Screwed us, now you're through with us and don't need us 
 Shoulda used a rubber 'cause this shit developed like a fetus 
 Sixteen carloads packed full of chicken 
 I'm riding shotgun and my trigger finger's itching 
 This shit is real, we got the info meal 
 It's to drop it off at the spot at 23rd and Foothill 
 I give a fuck if you the army, navy or marines 
 Ain't shit to lose 'cause we broke but packing Uzi magazines 
 I see the po-po with the trigger and flip the birdies six feet in the dirt 
 'Cause I guess he hadn't heard that 
 We are taking these if you please 
 (cheerio) 
 We are taking these if you don't please 
 (check it out) 
 We are taking these if you please 
 (cheerio) 
 We are taking these if you don't please
