You, you are not a riot 
 You are right wing terror military assault 
 You, you are not rebellion 
 You are a pretty piece of paper which is signed by murderers 
 You, you are not a riot 
 You are the tight leather pants on the old ex-general 
 You, you are not rebellion 
 I got the invite to your party and I threw it away 
 You, you are not a riot 
 You're an apologetic pad for the judge's gavel 
 You, you are not rebellion 
 You are a sitcom based on a torture chamber 
 You, you are not a riot 
 You are the fanfare for the king's drunken vomit 
 You, you are not rebellion 
 I got the invite to your party and I threw it away 
 A rebellion is both love and lust 
 And a riot is when lightning hits the right spot 
 And my painting isn't finished till it kills you 
 And it makes you feel more powerful than pills do 
 A rebellion is both love and lust 
 And a riot is when lightning hits the right spot 
 And my painting isn't finished till it kills you 
 And it makes you feel more powerful than pills do 
 You, you are not a riot 
 You are a condo complete with wall to wall carpet bomb 
 You, you are not rebellion 
 You're a well funded beat down in the boss's washroom 
 You, you are not a riot 
 You're the cold fish breath of death at my neck 
 You, you are not rebellion 
 I got the invite to your party and I threw it away 
 You fascist fashionista 
 You imperial chanteuse 
 You upper, crusty punk 
 You pillager's excuse 
 You duke and disciple of disconnection 
 Who fellates the Empire State 
 Building blank space on your paper 
 Matching blank looks on your face 
 A rebellion is both love and lust 
 And a riot is when lightning hits the right spot 
 And my painting isn't finished till it kills you 
 And it makes you feel more powerful than pills do 
 A rebellion is both love and lust 
 And a riot is when lightning hits the right spot 
 And my painting isn't finished till it kills you 
 And it makes you feel more powerful than pills do 
 You get hyped by the font in the death warrant 
 By the grain of the wood in the electric chair 
 The accent of the undertaker 
 By the architecture of police stations 
 By the reflection on the gun 
 By the crackle of the flame 
 You get hyped by the aesthetic of rebellion 
 No questions asked 
 You are not a riot
