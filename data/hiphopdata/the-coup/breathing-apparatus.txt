 My motherfucker took led it was unexpected 
 Mobbed through the do', smelled the disinfectant 
 Mashed third flo' on the elevator 
 Seen boots hemmed on the respirator 
 Death was on his face too soon 
 C'mon baby holla at your ace boom coon 
 Tell me who it was and I'll be buckin like a untamed stallion 
 Say another word and see me gather a batallion 
 (Boots) 
 Shit, I give a fuck who did the killing 
 Got a puncture in my lung, tell 'em gimme penicillin 
 Fingertips ain't got no feelin', pain-killin', gimme codeine 
 Don't let me vomit up my guts, let's keep the flo' clean 
 I seen 'em comin' for a mile through the rearview 
 I'll tell you one thing 'bout them po-po's, they don't love you 
 (E-roc) 
 Sheeyit, like I needed you to tell 
 Motherfucker make sense - you delirious as hell 
 (Boots) 
 Lean over the bed and let me whisper close 
 Watch these motherfuckers with the stethoscopes 
 You know I'm uninsured up in this b-i-otch 
 My medical plan was to not get shot 
 I get the... 
 One two three! code blue! 
 One two three! code blue! 
 *Bzzzzzzzzzzzzt* clear! 
 *Bzzzzzzzzzzzzt* 
 I've got a pulse...

 I'm feelin' hostile, with this fuckin' hose up my nostril 
 My bills be colossal, creditors be followin me 
 Like apostles, I jostled the fossils 
 Of thoughts that's given 
 Fuck these motherfuckers tryin' to pimp me for livin' 
 Scrape up scrilla for the box I'm in 
 If we can't hock some ends, for this oxygen 
 (E-roc) 
 I know what you feelin', we see eye to eye 
 And it's slugs goin' off if they let you die 
 I'm fin' ta split like a virus, come back with multiplicity 
 They always doin' this to the black ethnicity 
 And anybody offa who dey make moola 
 This should let you know yo' life's controlled by who da rula 
 It's some murderous, medical, supervision 
 Had my baby boy, couldn't get a circumcision 
 You ain't got insurance that be costin g's 
 They be actin' hands off like you got a disease 
 [B] ay man I got a disease

 [E] I ain't gon' let 'em fuck with your breathing apparatus 
 [B] please don't let 'em fuck with my breathing apparatus 
 (E-roc) 
 Motherfuckers tryin' to live like the huxtables 
 Comfortable, but my bank account ain't functional 
 And now another thing that's disturbin me 
 How the fuzz gon' put you in the infirmary? 
 (Boots) 
 See I'm a communist, I'll tell yo' momma the truth 
 And now they wanna assassinate me like they john wilkes booth 
 But umm, recognize sperm, cause yo' brain is the maternity 
 Conception through yo' ear, now my game lasts through 
 Eterni-*cough*-ty *cough, cough* 
 Breathe again, breathe again... 
 And I will never breathe again... -> toni braxton (repeat 2x)

 It seems as if he's lost his will to pay
