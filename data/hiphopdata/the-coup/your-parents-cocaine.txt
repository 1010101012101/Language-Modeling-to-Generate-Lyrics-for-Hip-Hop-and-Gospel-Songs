1, 2, 3 
 The valet pointed me through the door 
 One more shot and you're on the floor 
 If cash talks, yours is a lion's roar 
 Guesquire, Christian Dior 
 You're the asshole ambassador 
 But your friends obey like labradors 
 I vomited on the alpine decor 
 It's okay, your daddy gon' buy some more 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 All your friends from school are here 
 Your frat boys got the rufies near 
 What will they want when you're out of beer? 
 Your parents' cocaine 
 Your graduation monster bash 
 The maids will pick up all the trash 
 In almost every room is stashed 
 Your parents' cocaine 
 Your daddy gon' make you VP of Sales 
 Don't mix good shit with the ginger ale 
 Pacific Heights ain't Sunnydale 
 You could murder somebody and be out on bail 
 Your mom's Amtrak, she's on the rails 
 So many bumps thought it was braille 
 One day, we're all gonna tip the scales 
 'Cause I gotta crew too big to fail 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Steve and Katie shut the door 
 And fucked all on the bathroom floor 
 Now they're up and looking for 
 Your parents' cocaine 
 Until you get that trust fund check 
 Pretend you worked for your respect 
 Janie's asking if she can test 
 Your parents' cocaine 
 All your esteemed colleagues and guests 
 Are here to celebrate your success 
 They only say, "Good luck" in jest 
 Your fortune guaranteed at the breast 
 And Dave, who lets you win at chess 
 Is with your girlfriend in her dress 
 They're tired of being your marionettes 
 You'll mourn in Rio via company jet 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Your daddy's got a business plan 
 Which made wars in Afghanistan 
 It bought your house in Bangkok and 
 Your parents' cocaine 
 Narcos kicked my windows out 
 They beat and dragged me out the house 
 They don't give a fuck about 
 Your parents' cocaine, your parents' cocaine 
 Oh no 
 They don't give a fuck about your parents' cocaine, boys and girls 
 And another line for you, and another line for you 
 Now do the world a favor and blow your fucking brains out
