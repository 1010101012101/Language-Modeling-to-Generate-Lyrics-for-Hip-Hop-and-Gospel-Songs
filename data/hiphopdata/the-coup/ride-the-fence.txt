Yeah, uh-huh 
 Yeah, that's right 
 Gotta get off the phone, bust this verse 
 Aight, okay 
 I'm anti-imperial 
 Anti-trust 
 Anti-gun if the shit won't bust 
 Anti-corporate, they anti-my essence 
 Anti-snortin' them anti-depressants 
 But I'm not pro-poppin' em; 
 I'm provocative 
 And pro-stoppin' them FBI operatives 
 Who professional at Black Man Pounce 
 And hand you a sentence that you can't pronounce 
 I'm also anti-narco, anti-vice 
 911 marks the anti-Christ 
 They anti-social, pointin' M-16's; 
 Guess I'm anti-the-anti-nigger-machine 
 Proletarian, funkadelicparliamentarian 
 Pro-revolt-in-the-21st-centurian 
 Pro-running up in Congress sayin' "Fuck it all" 
 But bring the people with you, that's the protocol 
 This beat is joyful like jailbreaks 
 The whole world is anti-United Snakes 
 So check it out, anticipate the anti-venom 
 And move your antibodies to this revolution rhythm 
 We goin' be fuckin' with 'em 
 Pro-union but most lost they bite 
 Anti-muthafuckas-crossin' a strike 
 Take a look around and be for or against 
 But you can't do shit if you ridin' the fence 
 Ride the fence 
 Now you don't really wanna ride the fence 
 Now do you really wanna ride the fence? 
 Why would you really wanna ride the fence 
 Don't ride the fence 
 Ride the fence 
 Now you don't really wanna ride the fence 
 Now do you really wanna ride the fence? 
 Why would you really wanna ride the fence 
 Don't ride the fence 
 I'm anti-uppin'-your-dollars-with-telekinesis 
 I done tried everyday, and that shit decreases 
 Anti-them-anti-crime-bill-pieces 
 We need cash and that's the anti-thesis 
 I'm pro-overthrow of the Hip Hop Nation 
 Pro-layin'-low-till-I'm-off-probation 
 Pro-people's-control-of-the-cash-and-corporations 
 Pro-prophylactic yet pro-creation 
 Anti-watered-down-drinks-in-fancy-cups 
 Anti-promoters-who-don't-ante-up 
 But I'm not anti-club 
 I know that power is the most effective anti-drug 
 I'm pro-Zapatista 
 Pro-Cuba 
 Viva! 
 Pro-la raza sayin' "Fuck La Migra" 
 Policia se asesina 
 Lemme show you what I mean 
 I'm anti-republican and democratic 
 If they self-destruct 
 That's anti-climactic 
 Tired of bein' hunted like an antelope 
 Take the system by the throat 
 That's the antidote 
 So I pose a proposition 
 Take a look, be in support or opposition 
 Then be proactive proceed with confidence 
 'Cause you know that you can't change shit by ridin' the fence 
 Ride the fence 
 Now you don't really wanna ride the fence 
 Now do you really wanna ride the fence? 
 Why would you really wanna ride the fence 
 Don't ride the fence 
 Ride the fence 
 Now you don't really wanna ride the fence 
 Now do you really wanna ride the fence? 
 Why would you really wanna ride the fence 
 Don't ride the fence
