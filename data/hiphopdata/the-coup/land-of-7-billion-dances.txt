Shake it, yeah, we agitate it, yeah 
 We bump and break it, yeah, we finna take it 
 Hey, now we gon' work it, yeah, we jam the circuit, yeah 
 We got the verdict, yeah, it's fuck they circus, 1,2,3, go 
 Electromagnetic with a bomb aesthetic 
 But we ain't breaded edit, got no credit 
 Listen real close to my phonetics 
 The monster is awoke and I hope you fed it 
 If this your first time here, raise your hand 
 If the police come, hide the contraband 
 We all leave in a box and a long sedan 
 How you want your name read by the anchorman? 
 Drop the hips, apocalypse 
 We ho'in out here 'cause they got the chips 
 Like, "Put it anywhere, but not the lips." 
 Takeover, let's plot the shit 
 Shake it, yeah, we agitate it, yeah 
 We bump and break it, yeah, we finna take it 
 Hey, now we gon' work it, yeah, we jam the circuit, yeah 
 We got the verdict, yeah, it's fuck they circus, 1,2,3, go 
 Shut 'em down, close the books 
 Them dudes in the boardroom, those is crooks 
 Take it to the street, bows and hooks 
 If you stop they money, they froze and shook 
 I'm a rap bandit, muthafucka, dabnabit 
 And we been backhanded all across the Atlantic 
 And we finna start static all across the damn planet 
 Make they ass crap granite while we change the mathematics 
 I guess you all wonder why I called this meeting 
 Paycheck cut can't stop the bleeding 
 Sharks are feeding, we ain't eating 
 No more pleading, time for stampeding 
 Shake it, yeah, we agitate it, yeah 
 We bump and break it, yeah, we finna take it 
 Hey, now we gon' work it, yeah, we jam the circuit, yeah 
 We got the verdict, yeah, it's fuck they circus, 1,2,3, go
