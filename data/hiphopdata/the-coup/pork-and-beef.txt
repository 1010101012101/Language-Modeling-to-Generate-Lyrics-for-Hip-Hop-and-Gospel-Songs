Coup, yeah 
 It's all good man, we off in the Oakland Hills 
 Dodging 'em one time, check it out 
 If you got beef with C-O-P's 
 Throw a Molotov at the P-I-G's 
 'Cause they be harassing you and me 
 Ya gotta understand how we still not free 
 If you got beef with C-O-P's 
 Throw a Molotov at the P-I-G's 
 'Cause they be harassing you and me 
 Ya gotta understand how we still not free 
 Don't trust the police, no justice no peace 
 They got me face down, in the middle of the street 
 Pistol whip me with the heat, chicken shits sizzling 
 Trying to serve me the all-you-can eat murder beef 
 I'm a young, black, heterosexual male 
 Don't drink no drank, don't smoke, don't sell 
 That's the real reason that they want me up in jail 
 They want me to fail, I resist and rebel 
 See I give a fuck about the C-O-P's 
 P-I-G's I wonder if I can shake em' like a P-I-T 
 'Cause they wanna see me D-I-E 
 Got me cash under mob, I'm a pre-O.G. 
 Dark Sobe associates, vicious, venomous vocalist 
 Chrome 4-4 toting, holding it down for Oakland 
 Folks do be smoking and shit we do what we holding 
 Some just don't notice they get demoted 
 Throw em' all the time music 
 If you got beef with C-O-P's 
 Throw a Molotov at the P-I-G's 
 'Cause they be harassing you and me 
 Ya gotta understand how we still not free 
 If you got beef with C-O-P's 
 Throw a Molotov at the P-I-G's 
 'Cause they be harassing you and me 
 Ya gotta understand how we still not free 
 This is for them babies with them empty plates 
 For that raise ripped that you didn't calculate 
 If you ever in your life been a ward of the state 
 On the corner with cake 
 If they send an undercover and you took the bait, huh 
 Next time I see em' with no hesitation 
 I'm peeling off like stolen registration 
 And leave a lot of smoke 
 See I'm that sort of folk 
 That been pig hunting since my mama's fucking water broke 
 'Cause they the henchmen nah they the lynchmen 
 Between the rich and puffs of weed known to trench them 
 'Cause they dispense with the dollars and cents 
 So when you stand go get candles, flowers, and incense 
 Behind steel gates is fifty percent of our bill rates 
 A pre-kin making microchips for Bill Gates 
 Pelican Bay, t-shirts for the workout 
 Police station where the slave catchers lurk out 
 Listen to the thunder, I'm no more taking under routes 
 We'll synchronize and give em' shit to wonder 'bout 
 The DEA is filthy, yell not guilty 
 We need control of the cash and the realty 
 And get rid of all the motherfucking parasites 
 More than weed burn at 420 Fahrenheit 
 Shaking in they boots when we start to bust 
 They ain't scared of rap music, they scared of us 
 If you got beef with C-O-P's 
 Throw a Molotov at the P-I-G's 
 'Cause they be harassing you and me 
 Ya gotta understand how we still not free 
 If you got beef with C-O-P's 
 Throw a Molotov at the P-I-G's 
 'Cause they be harassing you and me 
 Ya gotta understand how we still not free
