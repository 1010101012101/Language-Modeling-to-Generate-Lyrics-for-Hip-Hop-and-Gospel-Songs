Come on, kids 
 Gather 'round 
 Listen up 
 The magic clap 
 M-A-G-I-C-C-L-A-P, let's go 
 M-A-G-I-C-C-L-A-P, let's do it 
 Clap, magic clap 
 Clap, magic clap 
 It's like a hot wire, baby 
 When we put it together 
 When the sparks fly 
 We'll ignite the future forever 
 This is the last kiss 
 Martin ever gave to Coretta 
 It's like a paparazzi picture 
 When I flash my Beretta 
 I got scars on my back 
 The truth on my tongue 
 I had the money in my hand 
 When that alarm got rung 
 We wanna breathe fire 
 And freedom from our lungs 
 Tell Homeland Security 
 We are the bomb 
 Clap, magic clap 
 Clap, magic clap 
 Hurry up, get in, close the do' 
 This here the meeting for the overthrow 
 Waiting on that concrete rose to grow 
 Doing lines that ain't quotable 
 Counting up all that dough you owe 
 You ain't s'posed to know its opposable 
 We are not disposable 
 Muscle up kid, we got blows to throw 
 Till the folks have risen there'll be no decision 
 We make the motor move, they chauffeur driven 
 Right now we can't shine right like a broken prism 
 I figured out the fourteenth is a broke amendment 
 Clap, magic clap 
 Clap, magic clap 
 Good evening, tonight we bring to you 
 Worn out streets that'll sing to you 
 .45 shells that'll dance to the beats 
 Stomachs so loud, it'll cancel the speech 
 Checks that vanish if you blink an eye 
 Grace getting locked in the clink to die 
 A salary cap on a birth certificate 
 Notarized lies that burst in triplicate 
 Morning prayers for the car to start 
 A man and a whiskey in a heart to heart 
 Hope in a track suit to flash and run 
 While agony chases with a badge and gun 
 Poetry shouted from the squeal of the bus brakes 
 Hands in the air try to feel for an escape 
 Flash in my eyes like candid snaps 
 When we slap back, it's the magic clap 
 C'mon do it 
 C'mon do it 
 C'mon do it 
 C'mon do it, magic clap
