Baby boy 
 (get it together) 
 with big brown eyes 
 And oh my God, with thick long lashes mind you 
 Crying to the beat of the words project complex 
 Looking out his window 
 (get it together) 
 Wondering if he is now the owner of a complex 
 Living in the projects, ha 
 Yeah, well er um, mama's living on welfare 
 And she ain't been living well 
 And that for damn sure ain't fair 
 That's 360 degrees of poverty 
 (get it together) 
 Baby boy with big brown eyes 
 And oh my God, with thick long lashes mind you 
 Realizing living in a society with a bunch of menaces 
 (get it together) 
 Can't be all damn bad when labelled a menace to society 
 Well shit he fit right in 
 Looking at you like you're mad 
 (get it together) 
 'Cause you talking out your butt wah wahwahwah 
 Just say no to drugs, but say yes to what? 
 Baby boy 
 (get it together) 
 with big brown eyes 
 And oh my God, with thick long lashes mind you 
 Thinks he's a man now 
 'Cause he now has a baby boy 
 (get it together) 
 with big brown eyes 
 And oh my God, with thick long lashes mind you 
 Crying to the same beat of the words project complex 
 Looking out his window wondering 
 Am I not the owner of a complex 
 Living in the projects? 
 You see what goes around comes back around 
 And oh goddamn, here it come now
