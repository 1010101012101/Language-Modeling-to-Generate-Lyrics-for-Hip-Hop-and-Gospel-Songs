As the monster stood before his colleagues, he sang 
 Angelically and wiped the blood off his fangs 
 The papers on the boardroom table were stained 
 From corpses piled on top of them slain 
 One monster yelled at me, 
 "You've got the brains!" 
 And traced his claw along the table's woodgrain 
 It smelled like leather, Old Spice and pain 
 His assistant, when yanked by choke-chain, explained 
 We've got a lot to teach you, Cassius Green 
 We've got a lot to teach you, Cassius Green 
 The assistant crouched at the monster's feet 
 Proudly in a puddle of urine and meat 
 The monsters all howled at the morning spreadsheet 
 Above cacophonous screams from below in the street 
 The gargoyles that guard the building weeped 
 I quietly calculated routes for retreat 
 One beast stuck his talons out as if to greet 
 And said, 
 "Welcome to the good life, son. Take a seat." 
 We've got a lot to teach you, Cassius Green 
 We've got a lot to teach you, Cassius Green 
 The beast who was frothing between his tusks 
 Said, 
 "They work it, we run it. they shouldn't fuss. 
 The order of things is basically just." 
 I heard cheers from the creatures trapped in the air ducts 
 I told them to smother in their mountains of stuff 
 And headed for the elevator door in disgust 
 They said 
 "You've forgotten. You're one of us." 
 I looked down at my tail, rattled it and I cussed 
 We've got a lot to teach you, Cassius Green 
 We've got a lot to teach you, Cassius Green 
 We've got a lot to teach you 
 We've got a lot to teach you 
 We've got a lot to teach you 
 We've got a lot to teach you 
 We've got a lot to teach you 
 We've got a lot to teach you 
 We've got a lot to teach you 
 We've got a lot to teach you 
 We've got a lot to teach you 
 We've got a lot to teach you 
 We've got a lot to teach you 
 We've got a lot to teach you
