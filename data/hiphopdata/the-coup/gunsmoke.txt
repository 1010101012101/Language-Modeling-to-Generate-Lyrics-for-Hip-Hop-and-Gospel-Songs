Come on, let's go 
 Put this under your belt 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 I be having homicide running through my mind 
 Don't know what's up with me, shit fuck with me all the time 
 Eating at my spine mothafucka in my prime 
 How you gonna get yours when you're too busy getting mine? 
 Now look, is this murderous criminal coming through 
 If you think it's E-Roc then the subliminals is working on you 
 There's thirty million of us buried in the fucking sludge 
 Can't come straight from fudge, I got a bloody grudge 
 Dead bodies lying all around me 
 But the real murderers ain't never got no bounty 
 Count it coroners as we sitting as statistics 
 With this ass if you think this blast is coming from my residential district 
 There's something that I think you should know 
 It's the motherfucking Coup, we from the east side O 
 Peep my flow creep by slow, see all my folks is broke 
 Survival for the cautious and the low, take a whiff and smell my gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 I'm getting white hairs from the nightmares every night 
 'Cause somebody got a contract on my life 
 I'm in a gang that's in an all out war 
 They drop me in when they knife my umbilical cord 
 So it begins with a slap on the ass 
 Now you in in the workin' class, trick 
 You here so fast we already made your casket 
 While it's got one buck 
 So the phrase gunshot gets hella tide 
 Can't take the only mothafuckas getting fried 
 Skeletons deep down in the ocean 
 'Cause them slave ships had that three stop motion 
 Coast down Fulton on the Mississippi River 
 Burning crosses and mothafuckas saying, 
 "Die nigga. Die nigga." 
 It all started when we start producing scratch 
 Some of my homies got no legs attached 
 Without no food up in the fridge, you ain't go never have peace 
 'Cause with a trigger, you can finger fuck without no grease 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 Off to the war 
 Off to the war 
 Off to the war 
 Off, off, off to the war 
 I say fuck the whole judge and the jury 
 My mind got delirious, my eyes got blurry 
 Had my uncle strapped to the chair, hands ox-tied 
 Breathing in gas, breathing out carbon monoxide 
 Whole system's stacked like a loaded bowel 
 'Cause ain't no billionaires on the murder trial 
 Make the ghetto concentration camps every mile 
 So march your ass through the gas chambers single file 
 Who's the biggest problem that they show on the tv? 
 My peoples die of starvation and TB 
 See me with an angry face and a beanie 
 'Cause my relationship with Uncle Sam is steamy 
 It's what I've been through, I'm like Sincue 
 What I got, you got to get, it put it in you 
 The ruling class was cut throat since we fresh off the boat 
 Show 'em we ain't no joke, let them choke off the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) Smell the gunsmoke 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky) 
 (Funky, f-f-f-funky)
