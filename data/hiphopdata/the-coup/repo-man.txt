Who is the motherfucker rollin' through the hood? 
 Who is the motherfucker up to no good? 
 Y'all know who he is 
 Y'all know just who he is 
 Who is the motherfucker takin' your bank? 
 Who is the motherfucker always on the gank? 
 Y'all know who he is 
 Y'all know just who he is 
 Now who's that motherfucker who rollin' down my street 
 Every other week, jackin' shit while ya sleep 
 Creepin' through the cuts, heartless, don't give a fuck 
 If ya broke, 
 "Did you pay last month's car note?" 
 Oh I be scrapin', scratchin' for bones 
 I got the cellular phone I just picked up on loans 
 Keepin' up with them Jones put my ass in debt 
 Now who's the motherfucker tryin' to take my shit? 
 It's the Repo Man, addin' interest rates 
 He's got "BREAK-YO-SELF" on his license plate 
 He took my color TV, the dining room set 
 The microwave, my daddy's Corvette 
 If you in debt, he's gon' get yo ass for somethin' 
 I heard - it's No Future in Yo' Frontin 
 So let it be known, black folks don't own 
 They just give us this shit on loan 
 Who is the motherfucker rolling through the hood? 
 Who is the motherfucker up to no good? 
 It's the Repo Man 
 It's the Repo Man 
 Who is the motherfucker takin' your bank? 
 Who is the motherfucker always on the gank? 
 It's the Repo Man 
 Goddamn, it's the Repo Man 
 Seen him slidin' through the town about eleven o'clock 
 A 1994 50 and the tires were stock 
 He'll make a visit to your house like without no knock 
 And if you pulls out a pole it wouldn't be no shock 
 I gives a fuck how much you bench press, if you ain't pushin' up 
 That twenty-five percent interest 
 Your property gets chin checked, repossessed 
 Now your ride is at the shoe department, dressed for less 
 He gives a fuck if youse a mobber with three toddlers and a infant 
 He'll take the TV and the carpet in the living room that's stain resistant 
 It's like living in the house with yo daddy pearchin' nice 
 You can own a chair, but it's still Pop's merchandise 
 And ain't no gettin' up and movin' outside 
 The Repo Man got clientele worldwide 
 But trip on this, when you think you step ahead 
 'Cause most likely, you one paycheck ahead of the Repo Man 
 Who is the motherfucker rollin through the hood? 
 Who is the motherfucker up to no good? 
 Y'all know it's the Repo Man 
 It's the Repo Man 
 Who is the motherfucker takin your bank? 
 Who is the motherfucker always on the gank? 
 It's that Repo Man 
 Goddamn it's the Repo Man 
 Who is the motherfucker rollin' through the hood? 
 Who is the motherfucker up to no good? 
 Who is the motherfucker takin your bank? 
 Who is the motherfucker always' on the gank? 
 Who is the motherfucker rollin' through the hood? 
 Who is the motherfucker up to no good? 
 Who is the motherfucker takin your bank? 
 Who is the motherfucker always' on the gank? 
 Who is the motherfucker rollin' through the hood? 
 Who is the motherfucker up to no good? 
 Who is the motherfucker takin your bank? 
 Who is the motherfucker always' on the gank?
