Uh! 
 I wanna piss on your grave! 
 Make me feel all right! 
 Yaa Yaa Yaa! 
 Uh! 
 I wanna piss on your grave! 
 Make me feel all right! 
 Yaa Yaa Yaa! 
 While you was eatin' 
 T-bone steaks 
 In palatial estates, 
 Ornate with gates that automate 
 So those you hate could only spectate, 
 I was kissing my mate 
 Through iron grates 
 While the guards wait, 
 50 cent rate for making license plates. 
 My papermate pen shakes 
 Vibrates from 808 quakes 
 Over breaks 
 Dug outta crates 
 That sag from weight 
 Of the vinyl plates... 
 Girls work till they back ache 
 And their breasts con't lactate 
 You're laughin' to the bank 
 Smilin', showin' all your plaque flakes 
 Contesting, contesting 1,2,3 
 Never shoulda been put in the penitentiary 
 Boots from The Coup would like to say 
 I'll shove these foodstamps down your throat 
 Just to block your airway 
 And that's the fair way 'cause everyday 
 You're on a moola mission 
 Military killin' millions till you low on ammunition 
 Bodies beyond recognition 
 Twisted complex positions 
 Then their kids work in your factories 
 And die of malnutrition 
 See your net profit stats 
 Hold some murderous facts 
 But if you listen to the news you mighta 
 Heard it was blacks 
 You got us herded in shacks 
 I got the pertinent tax 
 How 'bout the one for when I bust my ass 
 And you relax 
 I'll hit your head wit an axe 
 Play soccer wit' your brain 
 To make it official 
 Slice your jugular vein 
 Still writin' songs that my momma could sang 
 And if you feel some yellow drips on your skull 
 It ain't rain. 
 Uh! 
 I wanna piss on your grave! 
 Make me feel all right! 
 Yaa Yaa Yaa! 
 Uh! 
 I wanna piss on your grave! 
 Make me feel all right! 
 Yaa Yaa Yaa! 
 That bitch ass on the front of a buck 
 Never gave a fuck 
 He forced his black women slaves 
 To give him dick sucks 
 And when he bust a nut 
 He'd laugh and cackle 
 Let the leather whip crackle 
 Send 'em back to pick tobacco 
 Shackled 
 Wouldn't give 'em nil 
 So his homies stacked bills 
 Fought on flatland and hill 
 To keep the british out the till, scrill 
 Kept Washington dumpin' 'em in ditches 
 So slave owning son of a bitches 
 Could keep their riches 
 Which is how the war got funded 
 With two centuries of juice 
 From Black slaves bodies 
 And the profits they produced 
 You could deduce 
 That these men might win 
 Fit right in 
 And make rights then 
 Just for rich white men 
 So they quit fightin' 
 And wrote up a declaration 
 Protective decoration 
 For their business operations 
 A gorilla pimpin' nation, no freedom - just savage 
 Now the whole world's ravaged 
 From their hunger for the cabbage 
 Your fifth period history teacher 
 Tellin' lies like a tweeker 
 Bump this song through the speaker 
 Watch they face get weaker 
 'Less they righteous and they kickin' the facts 
 They gon' smile 'cause this shit is on wax 
 One thing I gots to ask 
 George Washington down in hell can you see me? 
 I'm standin' on your grave 
 And I'm finsta take a pee-pee! 
 Tour guide: Excuse me sir, did you say you have to pee? 
 Boots: Nah, I said I love it here in D.C. 
 Tour guide: Well, anyway folks, continuing on with the tour. 
 We're here at the Arlington National Cemetery. 
 Behind all of you, right where the gentleman with the afro is standing, 
 Is the grave of of America's first and greatest hero, our first president -- 
 Pants unzipping 
 George Washington 
 Piss hitting the ground 
 Oh, uh-uh. 
 Cameras click 
 Uh! 
 I wanna piss on your grave! 
 Make me feel all right! 
 Yaa Yaa Yaa! 
 Uh! 
 I wanna piss on your grave! 
 Make me feel all right! 
 Yaa Yaa Yaa! 
 Knock knock muthafucka, yes once again 
 I'll make you pay for your sins 
 In the trunk o' your Benz 
 See youse an always fitted 
 Always acquitted 
 Parasitic leech 
 Cain't be burned off my back 
 Wit' no fiery speech 
 Your hands is soft as a peach 
 'Cause you ain't never did work 
 Been rich ever since 
 Your daddy's dick went squirt 
 Have you ever hurt from your back? 
 Ducked from rat-a-tat-tats? 
 Seen your mama on crack? 
 Lived in a pontiac? 
 Drank baby similac 
 So you could have protein? 
 (Just for enough energy 
 To hustle up some mo' green?) 
 I could paint some mo' scenes 
 Vergin' on the obscene 
 But I'd rather show up at your palace 
 With a mob scene 
 I spoke to my accountant 
 Who spoke to my attorney 
 Who counseled my financial advisor 
 On a gurney 
 It's about fifty dollars 
 And that's almost like a sale 
 'Cause it costs too damn much 
 To let your rich ass inhale 
 True liberation ain't no word in the head 
 I'm yellin' murder 'em dead 
 For some fish, steak and bread 
 You pay me 10 g's a year, 
 I pay you fifteen million hun'ed??? 
 Sorry, you just ain't in the budget... 
 Uh! 
 I wanna piss on your grave! 
 Make me feel all right! 
 Yaa Yaa Yaa! 
 Uh! 
 I wanna piss on your grave! 
 Make me feel all right! 
 Yaa Yaa Yaa!
