Hey, how you do? 
 And if you don't already know about my partners 
 Let me introduce you to the nappy headed crew 
 The coup 
 Boots, E-Roc and Pam the Funkstress 
 Damn, these motherfuckas jam 
 Bopping in the '94 to slide into '95 
 Riding like so 
 And if you aint already know 
 Act like i told you, punk 
 This is the foundation of funk 
 But before I let 'em loose 
 Don't worry 
 Pass me some of that genocide and juice
