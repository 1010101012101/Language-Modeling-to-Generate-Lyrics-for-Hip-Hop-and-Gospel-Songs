Hey you, we got your war 
 We're at the gates, we're at your door 
 Hey you, we got your war 
 We're at the gates, we're at your door 
 We got the guillotine 
 We got the guillotine, you better run 
 We got the guillotine 
 We got the guillotine, you better run 
 We got the guillotine 
 We got the guillotine, you better run 
 We got the guillotine 
 We got the guillotine, you better run 
 We want to thank you for flying with us 
 We know you coulda stayed home, just cried and cussed 
 May all your guns go off if it's time to bust 
 May all they tanks have time to rust 
 They got the armies turning bullets into gold 
 They got the hookers turning tricks in the cold 
 And every time the police kicks in a door 
 An angel gas breaks sticks in the O 
 And even if a d-boy flips him a O 
 It ain't enough to buy shit anymore 
 Sleep in the doorway, piss on the floor 
 Look in the sky, wait for missiles to show 
 It's finna blow 
 'Cause they got the TV, we got the truth 
 They own the judges and we got the proof 
 We got hella people, they got helicopters 
 They got the bombs and we got the, we got the 
 We got the guillotine 
 We got the guillotine, you better run 
 We got the guillotine 
 We got the guillotine, you better run 
 We got the guillotine 
 We got the guillotine, you better run 
 We got the guillotine 
 We got the guillotine, you better run 
 Don't talk about it, it won't show 
 Be about it, it's 'bout to blow 
 Don't talk about it, it won't show 
 Be about it, it's 'bout to blow 
 I just spit the dope lines, I don't snort 'em 
 Tell the boss to call police to escort him 
 You don't write all them lines, you just quote 'em 
 Get offline, plug into this modem 
 No, you can't out vote 'em, the rules is still golden 
 Only jewels we holding is if we guarding our scrotum 
 If you press your ear to the turf that is stolen 
 You can hear the sound of limitations exploding 
 Please sir, may we have another portion? 
 We're children of the beast that dodged the abortion 
 Neck placed firm 'tween the floor and the Florsheim 
 We'll shut your shit down, don't call it extortion 
 Caution, we're coming for your head 
 So call the feds and get files to shred 
 Every textbook read said bring you the bread 
 But guess what we got you instead? 
 We got the guillotine 
 We got the guillotine, you better run 
 We got the guillotine 
 We got the guillotine, you better run 
 We got the guillotine 
 We got the guillotine, you better run 
 We got the guillotine 
 We got the guillotine, you better run 
 Let's keep it banging like a shotgun 
 We in the war before we fought one 
 Now if you're tired of working from day to day 
 A common enemy, we got one 
 Now keep it banging like a shotgun 
 We in the war before we fought one 
 Now if you're tired of working from day to day 
 A common enemy, we got one 
 Don't talk about it, it won't show 
 Be about it, it's 'bout to blow 
 Don't talk about it, it won't show 
 Be about it, it's 'bout to blow
