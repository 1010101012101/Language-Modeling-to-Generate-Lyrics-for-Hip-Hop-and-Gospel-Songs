 This year will be the year 
 That we do what we've been waitin' for 
 This year will be the year 
 That we stop knockin' and kick down that door 
 Loved ones, we on the wire

 This time we're on fire 
 Make your mark on the world, let 'em hear your voice 
 'Cause our life on this ball is just a blink of an eye 
 And ain't no fairy godmama gon' help you and I 
 Woke up this mornin', brushed my teeth and spit out the lies 
 Decided I'm gon' live if I am gon' have to die 
 And you can take it any way you want 
 You can take it any way you want 
 You can take it any way you want 
 You can take it any way you want 
 You can take it any way you want 
 You can take it any way you want 
 You can take it any way you want 
 But just take it
