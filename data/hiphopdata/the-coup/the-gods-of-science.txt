Gods of science have spoken 
 "Grab the wire and choke them" 
 Ooh 
 Ooh 
 Hypnotic, the noose is slip-knotted 
 In a fourth quarter audit and pumped through the carotid 
 Many bought it, got it in patch, pill or tonic 
 Get your credit card, slot it and sign it on the dotted 
 Billionaires have squatted on the Magna cum laude 
 Hollered "Take my wallet. Make the people robotic, 
 Catatonic or harmonic with what they've been allotted." 
 And methodically they plotted against those who fought it 
 Whole cities are haunted 'cause some money bag nodded 
 And dropped the thought product of a Harvard grad upon it 
 Dollars turn the table boardroom and periodic 
 Listen to the sonics coming through your electronics 
 You can catalog it as harmonic or atomic 
 Howsenever, when I bomb it, molecules turn into solids 
 Some pray to the Christ, look to Buddha or Muhammad 
 Some pray to the crack of a rich man's pocket 
 The biggest advance was plumbing to the projects 
 Now the scientific process got hijacked for profits 
 It flows in the direction that a silver spoon prodded 
 We'll get science for the people when we run the economics 
 Gods of science have spoken 
 "Grab the wire and choke them" 
 Ooh 
 Ooh
