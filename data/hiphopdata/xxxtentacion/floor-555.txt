I'll put one in that chamber like you wanna face a God? 
 Nobody face the fake fuck, aight? 
 Fuck us up, feelin' God, level up, feelin' odd 
 Feel very Beverly Hill, Westside 
 Bitch I'm drillin' your neighbor daughter at Best Buy 
 If I hit up your daddy, nigga, you best slide 
 If you totin' that pistol, nigga, you best ride 
 If you shoot that shit at me, nigga, I best die 
 'Cause I'm a muh'fuckin' narcissist 
 Tremble, you catch a clip, bitch, and you not equipped with that 
 Pussy boy, don't be talkin' shit 
 Or you can meet this AK-47, it got kick back 
 I'm a muhfuckin' monster, in the heart of the moshpit 
 Put that boy in a coffin, 'cause the way that he talkin' 
 Pussy boy, don't be gawkin', I ain't doin' no barkin' 
 I'ma let that shit rip, leave his ass in the parkin' 
 Fuckboy, don't test me 
 Fuckboy, don't test me 
 Fuckboy, don't test me 
 Fuckboy, don't test, boy don't test 
 Boy, don't test, boy, don't test 
 Boy, don't test, boy, don't test 
 Boy don't, ay, yuh, ay 
 Fuckboy, don't test me 
 Fuckboy, don't test me 
 Fuckboy, don't test me 
 Fuckboy, don't test, boy, don't test 
 Boy, don't test, boy don't test 
 Boy, don't test, boy don't test 
 Boy, don't, ay, yuh, ay
