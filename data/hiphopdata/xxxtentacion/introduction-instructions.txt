To find, to find the exact words, to find the perfect words 
 To say less, but to say more, was ideal with this project 
 And till my energy and mind be felt, in a less aggressive way 
 But a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album 
 To show the versatility and to show th- to open minds in itself was the goal of this album 
 And to acquire a large amount of passion 
 And love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album 
 Loyalty to myself was the goal of this album 
 So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions 
 If you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind 
 If you don't listen to the alternative sound 
 And you've never been into the alternative sound 
 And have not been open to trying different things 
 Open your mind before you listen to this album 
 You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere 
 This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last 
 It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting, but discomforting at the same time 
 So, with this project, again, you're entering my mind 
 Feeling my insanity, feeling my genius, my energy 
 Enjoy
