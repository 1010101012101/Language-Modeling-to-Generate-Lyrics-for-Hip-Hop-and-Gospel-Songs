Swift (Ha) 
 My Forty-Fo be givin' liposucion 
 I blow a hole through your stomach open it up you be spillin your own guts 
 I'm a mad man, a walkin' trash can 
 You get beat with my bare hands, fuck a last chance 
 A mac-milli to slap you silly 
 The epitamy of what really can be the definition of misery 
 I'm never missin', I'm hittin it 
 I murder mitteney, curb stompin and puncturin kidneys 
 And put a nigga on Ripley's, bitches I ain't workin I'm on sick leave 
 I'll take your ability to breathe 
 And what that nigga need is a millimeter to eat 
 And have'em kissin' on millipedes in the street 
 Bizarre 
 In a fight, I'm first to throw a brick 
 First to load the clip, first to talk shit 
 But the last one to split, when shit get dip 
 Stupid bitch get hit with the four-fifth 
 I'm a ex-con who fought in vietnam 
 Every night, I'm thinkin' about a bomb 
 I've been so many places, all I do is laugh 
 Big hoes, fat hoes, even baby giraffes 
 I'm on fear factors, eat worms and broccoli 
 Tomatoes, mustard, mixed with guatamaccoli 
 Started a group with Flava Flav, the funny pack 
 I DJ and scratch while he smoke crack 
 Chorus: KonArtist 
 Now who want it with (Us)

 'Cause we don't want y'all o get it twisted at all

 Kuniva 
 I'm sure ya mama told you, nigga that drugs kill 
 If karma doesn't catch up witchu, then slugs will 
 Now everybody sayin' they real and they hug steal 
 Till they find'em layin dead in this tub with blood spilled 
 All over the floor, the carpet, the wall 
 You can call your peoples, my nigga, I'm sparkin'em all 
 Barkin, the dog is bitin for real 
 Starvin and fightin for meals, Bizarre got vicodin pills 
 Swift and Denaun ain't likely to chill, they hot headed 
 You a bitch, yeah I said it 
 I'll bet if God let it happen, then it's over Kuvina's out of his will 
 I just shot through his crib and knocked the snot out of his kids 
 Kon Artist 
 Mr. Porter, Brigade, sideways to next life 
 You in the range, you subject to be one with this knife 
 I clear up a bitches sight, straight lasik surgery 
 Y'all run to the emergency with an achin urgency 
 Yeah I'm nice courtesly escort you to the imfermary 
 7 mile, Ruyon ave. Till they straight up bury me 
 You expect us to believe that you a scrap and then it cost 
 When you pound a ?? 44 dog you lost 
 And I ain't talkin' 'bout a dog he lost 
 I'm talkin' 'bout a fuckin' puppy when I'm sayin' by the dog he lost 
 I scatter cries when I'm haulin off 
 Mozzeltov a nigga'll cross his head with a bottle of scotch 
 Proof (Don't get it twisted nigga, ya hear me?) 
 Who ever said Scrapping isn't a sport 
 Got me and bizzy in court, shadowboxing an invisible assault 
 Proof gon give it to ya raw like O.D.B. 
 Homey please who better than D-twease and Obie T. 
 Phony G's walkin' and talkin', 
 Never cocking a cock gun Macauly Caulkin, actors we droppin' ya coffins 
 When my mac speak, you have an R.I.P. list 
 Tatted sewn all from ya neck to ya ass cheek 
 And actually when murderers ??? my glock heated 
 Your life is like fat people legs, it's not needed 
 See how high P is, steamin in the snow like how pee is 
 D12 we got this bee-yotch
