 Hey, little mama 
 Don't you know I... like your style 
 I wanna pick you up and... show you around 
 My hometown 
 This is how... I get down, yeah

 Girl, can you cook? "Hell yeah" 
 'Cause I don't really care, how you look "You don't?" 
 Cause all I wanna do is... 
 {Bizarre mumbles "hold you" 
 And a girl mumbles "hold me"} 
 All I wanna do is... 
 {Bizarre mumbles "hold you" 
 And a girl mumbles "hold me"} 
 Girl, I got a crush on you 
 Girl, I got a crush on you
