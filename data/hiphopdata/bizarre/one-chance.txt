I ain't shit 
 I ain't even go to college 
 Matter of fact I ain't even think about goin' to college 
 If I wasn't be doin' this music shit 
 I don't what the fuck I'd be doin' 
 (Verse 1- Bizarre) 
 Ever since I was seven, I wanted to be a rap artist 
 Ten years later, I'm still out here starvin' 
 Started off talent shows, battles around the block 
 To bein' in the house, 'round six o'clock 
 Rappin', ***** you better get a job 
 Stop stayin' in the house, lookin' like a fat slob 
 And mama, I'm serious about this rappin' 
 She thought at the snap of a finger, it would all happen 
 Didn't think about school, homework I left 
 Report card, came home with all F's 
 I saw Redman, walked up to him and bust a rap 
 He said I was sweet and gave me a lil ??? 
 Couple hours, he'll give my phone a tap 
 I sit there, waited, he never called me back 
 I didn't take a shower, I waited for six hours 
 Where the fuck is Reggie Noble?! 
 (Hook x2- Bizarre) 
 You get one shot, only get one shot to take it 
 You get one chance, only get one chance to make it 
 You get one choice, only get one choice to break it 
 Be a man, be a man ***** 
 (Verse 2- Bizarre) 
 18 years old, mom threw me out the house 
 Responsibility, am I a man or a mouse 
 I'm starvin', tryna get a nine to five 
 And I'll do anything just to survive 
 I wanna go to Open Mic, but I gotta work tonight 
 Plus I can't pull up to the club, in a yellow dirk bike 
 My girlfriend's pregnant, I think she's havin' a boy 
 I gotta get two jobs, gotta buy her some toys 
 Plus my rap partner say he quit, he's goin' to church 
 After 5 years of puttin' in work 
 (Hook x2- Bizarre) 
 You get one shot, only get one shot to take it 
 You get one chance, only get one chance to make it 
 You get one choice, only get one choice to break it 
 Be a man, be a man ***** 
 (Verse 3- Bizarre) 
 I notice my goals is gettin' further away 
 Crystler plant, they gave me a call back today 
 Sixteen hour shift, leaves me a whip 
 Beeper on my hip, money starts to flip 
 Been six months, ain't no Hip Hop in here 
 My stomach gettin' fat for drinkin' all them beers 
 All I do is watch football and beat my wife 
 God damnit where the hell is my wife 
 My wife ain't cheatin', I know she ain't cheatin' 
 But every once in awhile she deserves a fuckin' beatin' 
 My group havin' a meetin' about tryna reunite 
 But I won't be there 'cause I gotta fuckin' work tonight 
 And I keep on cryin', just bout to lose it 
 It's been 2 years since I been away from music 
 The best MC from Detroit, ***** I was the man 
 Don't be like me and blow your chance 
 (Hook x2- Bizarre) 
 You get one shot, only get one shot to take it 
 You get one chance, only get one chance to make it 
 You get one choice, only get one choice to break it 
 Be a man, be a man *****
