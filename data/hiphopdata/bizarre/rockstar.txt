I'm a rock star 
 Baby baby baby, I'm a rock star 
 (Pass the blunt please) 
 Jumpin' jumpin' jumpin' my rock car 
 'Cause I'm a rock star 
 Baby baby baby, I'm a rock star 
 Where is Marshall? Who the hell cares? 
 Bizarre's on stage, shaking his derrier 
 I'm a rock star, touch my belly 
 Hugs and kisses get my clothes all sweaty 
 I'm the man, The lead singer of the band 
 On stage, for thousands of fans 
 Or you could be a dancer for Hammer 
 If you look you could see me in the camera 
 Acting like Luther Vandross 
 Anything to get them clothes off 
 The fans want Bizarre, they don't want Em 
 I'm backstage making out with Kim 
 I'm a rock star 
 Baby baby baby, I'm a rock star 
 Jumpin' jumpin' jumpin' my rock car 
 'Cause I'm a rock star 
 Baby baby baby, I'm a rock star 
 Jumpin' jumpin' jumpin' in my rock car 
 Rock... and roll... 
 The girls are gazing, it's so amazing 
 Black, white, thirteen to eighteen 
 I'm on TRL with David Chappelle 
 Talkin' 'bout the little two days I did in jail 
 Give me a sandwich, feed me lunch 
 You want some water? 
 Girl where's my punch? 
 If I don't get punch, you gon' get punched 
 Matter fact forget lunch 
 The guy with the shower cap running the streets 
 Big ol' stomach, they all know me 
 Last video, I was in the back 
 Now I started a group with Horney Mac 
 I'm a rock star 
 Baby baby baby, I'm a rock star 
 Jumpin' jumpin' jumpin' my rock car 
 'Cause I'm a rock star 
 Baby baby baby, I'm a rock star 
 Jumpin' jumpin' jumpin' in my rock car 
 Rock... and roll... 
 Me and 50 working out 
 Show you what the rock stars all about 
 It's been a while, I'm coming out 
 Doin' laps around Jimmy Iovine's house 
 I don't drive, I got a chauffeur to pick me up 
 Big ol' truck that's all beat up 
 Blue Cadillac, Diamond in the Back 
 " R. Dre's on line one" 
 Tell him to call me back 
 I'm too busy to take his call 
 I'm at the mall, collecting girls' drawers 
 This Rock Star stuff is the life for me 
 May 27th, buy my CD 
 I'm a rock star 
 Baby baby baby, I'm a rock star 
 Jumpin' jumpin' jumpin' my rock car 
 'Cause I'm a rock star 
 Baby baby baby, I'm a rock star 
 Rock... and roll...
