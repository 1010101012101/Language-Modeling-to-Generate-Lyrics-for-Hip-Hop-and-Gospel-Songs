 Ey guess what?

 Rob it, shoot it, kill it, murder (muuuurddaaaa) (x2)

 Fuck it, I just did two lines, a chrome tech 9, it'll tear out niggas spines 
 It's a party, go on in and have fun, 'cause after it's over all you gon hear is (run nigga run!) 
 Shootin, blastin, hittin in the floor, 10,000 in the safe, shiiiit I'm bout to score 
 'Cause I'm dangerous, off angel dust, shit ill bust, leave a nigga that k wit us 
 And this is for mah niggas that be robbin and stealin, car jackin, murder ones, and fuckin' drug dealin' 
 Rob it, shoot it, kill it, murder (muuuurddaaaa) (x2)
