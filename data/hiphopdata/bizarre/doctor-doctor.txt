(Feat. Obie Trice) 
 Maybe it's the weed 
 Maybe its more than the fucking weed 
 Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me 
 You better send me home 
 'Cause I ain't leavin' till somethin' leave with me 
 Right now that's all I'm on 
 (Verse 1: Bizarre) 
 I've had a headache for the last three days 
 And the last couple days I been missin' some pay 
 Do I have AIDS? I'm sniffin' and coughin' 
 And really this doesn't happen to often 
 Maybe I'm trippin', maybe I got the flu 
 Maybe I'm stressed out, somethin' I'm goin' through 
 It's been a week and me and wife ain't have sex 
 I'm usually a wild guy, I'll break her fucking neck 
 I'm sick and I'm starting to wimper 
 Its 90 degrees, it's like December 
 My temperature is 106 
 I can't shit and I feel like shit 
 Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me 
 You better send me home 
 'Cause I ain't leavin' till somethin' leave with me 
 Right now that's all I'm on 
 (Verse 2: Bizarre) 
 More trouble, here comes day two 
 I took a shit in my white underroos 
 My eyes look like I been smokin' crack 
 Exlax got me throwing up big macs 
 Nyquil, Advil, Tylenol, synus 
 Carryin' my ??? around like I'm ??? 
 Maybe it's the pork I ate in New York 
 Or maybe my baby mama wantin' child support 
 Or maybe it's the fish that made me sick 
 Or maybe it's the prostitute I let suck my dick 
 Or maybe its just the bottle of vodka 
 I don't care, I just need to see the doctor 
 Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me 
 You better send me home 
 'Cause I ain't leavin' till somethin' leave with me 
 Right now that's all I'm on 
 (Verse 3: Obie Trice) 
 I'ma kill this bitch, the tip on my dick 
 Ain't got an itch but I couldn't resist the switch 
 She's the type of bitch made to flinch 
 Walk passed *****s, all in the ass 
 Or its because I had a tall glass 
 I dropped my drawers without my dick wrapped 
 Purhaps, I could catch the crabs 
 But at that moment that's irrelevant 
 I knew what I know now, I practice celibace 
 And be hesitant from tappin' Evelyn 
 Heaven sent a message when I came back negative 
 Never fuck a bitch in the ass off a laxative 
 Doctor doctor, come put the breaks on me 
 You better send me home 
 'Cause I ain't leavin' till somethin' leave with me 
 Right now that's all I'm on
