What's up people? This is Sindee Syringe 
 We're here up in here snortin' sum lines 
 And we're all goin' straight to hell 
 Man, I pop so many pills, it's startin' to get scary 
 Bizarre, I'm your wife, bitch, I ain't Larry 
 And I don't give a fuck about pullin' out my dick 
 Look at the name of my clique 
 It's D12 hoe, yeah, baby 
 It's D12 hoe, yeah, baby 
 Yeah, yeah, Bizarre smoke atcha and got no problem 
 For ten hot dollars I fuck your bitch at the cabana 
 VD, AIDs that's what Bizarre got 
 For ten thousand Michael Johnson'll give me a shot 
 I sniff blow, high off a brick, crash into a ditch on 6/96 
 Nasty nigga, quick to lick a finger 
 Eat a bitch ass that tastes like a butter finger 
 And I'm going to hell for my nasty mouth 
 'Cause this is what rock 'n' roll's all about 
 I'm a psycho and it's fuckin' with me again 
 My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe 
 We hate life, fuck your life 
 I'm a psycho and it's fuckin' with me again 
 My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe 
 We hate life, fuck your life 
 Ever since I was a kid I had a violent past 
 Whooped a nurse's ass for touchin' my diaper rash 
 And I ain't goin' work, I'm a lazy shit 
 That's why I live at home with a fat white bitch 
 She's 36 and keep a gun full of arsenal 
 But her son's 13, loves to listen to Marshall 
 But I whoop his ass and send him a school 
 And let him know that takin' drugs is cool 
 See I'm on sum dumb shit, don't know right from wrong 
 All up on Murder Inc. tryin' to get Ja Rule on a song 
 And I used to be a virgin, grown ass man 
 Until I took a trip off to Neverland 
 Mike gave me milk and cookies, showed me his room 
 Kicked his ass over, I fucked him with a broom 
 'Cause I'm a psycho and it's fuckin' with me again 
 My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe 
 We hate life, fuck your life 
 I'm a psycho and it's fuckin' with me again 
 My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe 
 We hate, fuck your life, yeah 
 All day I dream about sex 
 Fuck a handicap bitch, me, Proof and Hex 
 And I don't give a fuck about no Britney Spears 
 Just tie the bitch up, nut in her ears 
 Bucks said when I'm in [Incomprehensible] I could get it for ten 
 For the last three months you know where I been 
 Snortin', shootin', gettin' a fix 
 Got two Indian bitches in the motel 6 
 Four bags and twenty beers 
 And I don't even know who the fuck D12 is 
 I'm on the stage doin' a love song 
 Yellow thong, knowin' damn well I'm wrong 
 And I don't want no prostitute to have no sex 
 I wanna bitch to break my neck while I try to get her wet 
 So kids, don't smoke no weed 
 'Cause you'll end up just like me 
 I'm a psycho and it's fuckin' with me again 
 My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe 
 We hate life, fuck your life 
 I'm a psycho and it's fuckin' with me again 
 My dreams, my drugs, my life, my sins, Sindee Syringe 
 We hate life, hate life, hate life, fuck your life 
 Nigga, fuck your life 
 Nigga, fuck my life
