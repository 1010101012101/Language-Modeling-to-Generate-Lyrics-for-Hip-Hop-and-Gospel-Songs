(Master P) 
 Hoe Games, Hoe Games 
 Suckers with no game 
 Hate to see a young g stack a mil man 
 (Master P) 
 It could be your best friend your row dawg, your homies, your partners 
 Niggaz that talk shit if the shoe fits I got ya 
 Buster you know I can't trust ya 
 If you was a bitch you know I can't trust ya 
 Suckers tried to play the P like a fuckin' clucker 
 When I'm the dopeman go ask your brother 
 Ask st. charles hot to be bald 
 Suckers want to talk shit like little kids in the school halls 
 Gold thangs rollin' sittin' on lorenzo 
 Bitches didn't want to ride when the P was in the pinto 
 Now I got a Lexus, took a trip to Texas 
 The P done went big time and fools want to wreck this 
 It's all legit, No Limit makes the hits 
 But suckers want to talk shit why, because I'm rich 
 Players hate to see a player make a mil man 
 If you ask me that ain't nothin' but some hoe games 
 Hoe Games, Hoe Games 
 Suckers with no game 
 Hate to see a young g stack a mil man 
 (Silkk) 
 Niggaz play hoe and get fucked 
 If hoes want to play niggaz hoes will get fucked up 
 Fool kinda mad 'cause I puts in work 
 I cock my chop jump out my drop and wipe off that smirk 
 Now niggaz want to play games 
 Bitch I'm quick to get 'em up fuck rap and fame 
 Still that g silkk riding on them thangs 
 Roll up a swish park my shit then hang 
 Nigga I'm always strapped, hoe I never skinny dip 
 And for them hoes a trizzo and for the niggaz a hollowtip 
 Hate to see me clock a grip 
 Hate to see me get rich 
 Hate to see me pull a hoe 
 Hate to see me pull this bitch 
 Player haters need to keep them games in the arcade 
 If I put a quarter abd a slug up in your ass you gon get played 
 A g to a g I mean a g to a hoe 
 And you can come up to me in the 94' 
 And get some more game and throw away the hoe shit 
 And leave them hoe games to a hoe bitch 
 (King George) 
 Niggaz talk shit behind my back like hoes 
 Smile in my face up frony mout clothes 
 Now its time to stop ya, here for the drappers 
 911 only hoes got ya 
 Prepare for the battle, you get streched out 
 I won't let it rest till its wire in your mouth 
 You know who you are I won't say no 
 Names in vain cease with hoe games 
 (C-Murder) 
 Now I'm trying to go legit and stick with this rap shit 
 I see more and more niggaz get they wig plit 
 I got cash but I ain't got no fucking pity nad smoke your ass 
 And move to another city brown nose bitches stay the 
 Fuck out my face how you want to take, take your ass 
 To the record store jealous motherfuckers 
 Running they mouth getting they nuts off 
 I can't wait to catch your ass with my sawdoff 
 Take this advice before you talk behind my back 
 Cause playing hoe games might get your cranium cracked
