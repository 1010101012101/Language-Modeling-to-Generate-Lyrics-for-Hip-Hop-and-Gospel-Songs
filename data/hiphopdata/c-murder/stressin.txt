Cut that mike up for me Bass 
 Let's do this thang boy, Deadly Sounds right back at ya 
 Can't stop none of this ? playa 
 Check this out 
 They don't want this chorus 
 All they want is Murder 
 They Don't Feel My Pain 
 But they gone feel my presence 
 Radio Scratch: (They've done, they've done 
 Had a lot of hard times) 
 And I've been stressin since a adolescent 
 Now I ain't never robbed rallys 
 But it was close, I've done stick ups for Bally's 
 We love to smoke 
 As I recall I heard you mention my name 
 What you love to see me stressin? 
 This ain't part of the game 
 You must be high 
 Cause you rockin' like a Bass Head 
 You hear me 
 I'm grindin', workin' hard for mine ya feel me 
 Ya feel me 
 400 years of pain and now this 
 It's like them cock roaches got you trained, just like a Bitch 
 You see they smile in yo face 
 Now what they after 
 And now they wanna take my place 
 Them Back Stabba's 
 Blucka Blucka, (Huh) I'mma Get You Sucka 
 We roll tinted windows on the black Humma Trucka 
 And after it rain he might be dead like Jesse James 
 Trained for pain even when I lose everything I gain 
 It's simple mathematics 
 When you go ballistic 
 Statistics show we breed soldiers in my district 
 It ain't like Mr. Rodgers 
 I learned the game, but it wasn't from the Dodgers 
 Pissed from pain, and Welfair wasn't a question 
 Just a decision, we embraced it as a blessin' 
 Cause food was missin' 
 And my tattoos tell a story 
 I'm Bossainie and Kevin died in his glory 
 I know he see me, I'm runnin' but I ain't movin' 
 It's like a dream cause all they want is Murder... 
 That's what it seem 
 Come meet me in the projecets 
 'Cause it's a set-up 
 And the only way to stop, (is what) watch him get wet up 
 Ain't no since in you fakin' with me 
 I'm just a pebble and the window you got is bigger than me 
 Watch me shadow while blood splattered and hit the pave 
 I'm puttin' fresh flowers on my empty grave (Damn) 
 Tryna sell a million so I can provide for my lil' one 
 Shit they want little mess like the rest of the ghetto children 
 It's confusing I'm losing pieces to a broken puzzle 
 Russian Ruolette to my head it's down bubble muzzle 
 I'm Kamakazi, you try me put yourself right beside me 
 I'm a wanted man call Baby Mamma so she can hide me 
 The only victim is all the brotha locked up in prison 
 Gettin' letters and pictures, I know they people miss em' 
 Take a ride to Texas in a stolen Lexus 
 Three mack 11's is ready, that's me only protection 
 Who do I believe in really, I put my faith in GOD 
 I was dealt some Bad Cards, He's fightin' in school yards (What) 
 And fightin' at night behind bars 
 The Devil hit me wit a Murder Charge, All they want is Murder Boy...
