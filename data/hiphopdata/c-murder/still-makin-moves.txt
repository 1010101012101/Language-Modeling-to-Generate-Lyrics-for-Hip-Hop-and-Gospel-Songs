(Little Kevin) 
 Hey cmurder, who you who you hang with? 
 (C-murder) 
 Say lil kevin boy, you know I'm still makin' moves with thugs 
 (Master p) 
 Part 2 nigga! haha all dem thugs get 'em up out there nigga 
 (C-murder) 
 I leave the house 10 o clock and jump in my lac, 
 Call my niggas fiend 'n' mac 'cause they got my back, 
 And even the one time you was tryin' to hack, 
 I still pack a strap and recock my gat, 
 Eliminatin all my enemies tryin' to blind me, 
 I'm still makin' moves but it's hard to find me, 
 Steadily gettin' richer pursuin my dreams, 
 I just cashed a check for three million d's, 
 I told y'all niggas last year don't play no games, 
 Got dem no limit niggas out there callin my name, 
 Went from sneakin in stores to dem sell out shows, 
 Went from crime to rhyme already did my time, 
 I say you don't wanna go to war wit me, 
 I got hot boy 'n' big swoll wit me, 
 Just some more ghetto muthafuckas ridin' wit me, 
 Cause makin' moves wit thugs is a hobby, 
 (Mo b. dick) 
 All my homies know tha deal, 
 If you thuggin' keep it real, 
 Don't forget to pack tha steel, 
 Incase we got some caps to peel, 
 You know tha deal, 
 This thug's for real, 
 We pack tha steel, 
 Got caps to peel 
 (Master p) 
 How many niggas wanna ride wit me? 
 Throw a party thug girls get wild wit me, 
 Its involved wit green nigga bother p, 
 56 million like tha lottery, 
 From the charlotte hornets to mtv 
 How many patnas do you see when I'm on TV? 
 And if I get cut I'm gonna buy tha team, 
 'Cause I made my money from tha triple beam 
 I lived tha life of a dealer nigga hangin' wit killas, 
 I fucked around and come back to slangin keys, 
 But that's all right cause these niggas get paid, 
 Young niggas gonna be thugs to the grave.
