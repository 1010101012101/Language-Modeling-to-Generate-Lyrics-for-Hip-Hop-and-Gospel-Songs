 Can't no one out side infiltrate this no limit organization 
 So prepare yourself prepare for a battle 
 Real niggaz going to ride playa haters going to die because after 
 Dollars and cents only the strong survive 
 <C-Murder 
 In gats we trust no limit niggaz going to bust 
 If you ride with me you gots to die with me 
 Put your rags in the air here comes the brigade 
 I sold dope on the block cause true niggaz get paid 
 Army fitues with my boots and my gat 
 Luitentant of a bunch of niggaz 
 Paid and strapped we got we got bitches and blunta 
 We got weed and money representant them killaz 
 And them haters be running I got bitch niggaz

 Oh lord can you feel me 
 Or tell me why my lil' brother Kevin Miller 
 Had to die and I still hear 
 Gun shots when I sleep so I'm sayin' 
 Fuck the world and the police 
 Incarcerated by the ghetto so we trapped 
 That's why broke niggaz in the hood bust caps 
 Nigga said gangsters make good politicians 
 And that is why we stay strong black and independent 
 So the world is like fuck a viatnam

 For mexicans and blacks ugh
