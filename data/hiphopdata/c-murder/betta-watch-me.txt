 Man I hit the set, and them bays be gettin' ghost (Yeah) 
 Huh,(Yeah) They spookin'(Yeah)

 'Cause I'm hurtin', I gotta get me 
 Now where the goods at

 And if them goods bad

 Verse 1 (C-Murder): 
 See my pockets on E-fall 
 I'm really tweekin' 
 I can't be sittin' up here hurtin' all weekend 
 I keep on fallin' off, at the worse times 
 And if I slip, it ain't my fault I'm gone reverse mine 
 My pain, I'm gone merge mines 
 'Cause I'm sick wit it 
 Now where them balla's at 
 I'm lookin' for the big ticket 
 10 minutes from losin' it 
 1 day from lock up 
 The way I'm livin' sooner or lata I'm gone be boxed up 
 Nobody trustin' me 
 They know I'm commin' 
 I hit the block and I swear 
 I see them cowards runnin' 
 Puttin' they stash up 
 Even out they windows 
 Now why they trippin' 
 I"m the exact opposite of 5-0 
 It's called Survival of the Fittest 
 I can't help it, 'cause I'm wit 
 And you ain't wit 
 I come to get it, Yeah I did it

 I can't take that back 
 So beat yo feet black 
 Oh, y'all gone remember me 
 Cause me ain't no joke 
 Me do what me does 
 Cause ain't no being broke 
 I was raised in this 
 I ain't ask for this 
 I tried changin' my life 
 And now it's back to this 
 Somebody pray for me 
 The Lord is testin' me 
 But them people they gone 
 Have problems arrestin' me 
 Now my lungs hurtin' 
 Need that black vest 
 Man, I feel like Jackin' one of these Rappers 
 Verse 2 (Fiend): 
 We'll score a team with the Fellon's 
 Wher y'all did the Misdameanors 
 Niggas my age was pushin' Beamers (Pushin' Beamers) 
 Niggas that sprayed was usin' Nina's (Usin' Nina's) 
 A-K's and S-K, ya chest cave 
 Ya neck shaved and ya waves turned to still water 
 Bullet on fire, wreck some money still daughters 
 Kill fathers, pop a seed in ya momma (Momma) 
 This routine, you pussies start ya new thing 
 I'm from the city where everythang crooked 
 When the right kind of money, make the judge overlook it 
 And I'm skrewed up 
 I ain't talkin' Swisha House 
 For I learned to tie my shoes up 
 I was burnin' dudes up 
 My ward verse yo ward, Put them 22's up 
 These 26's make ya, Put them 22's up 
 This mac 9, it mean I ain't givin' you (Fuck That) 
 But bullets in that shiney new truck 
 What ya know about fightin for 5 days 
 Hangin' niggas upside down 
 Commin' at ya sideways (Sideways) 
 A crooked H is goin' 67/5 
 And I add them 3 quarters 
 For the ride plus I'm high 
 Verse 3 (Popeye):
