C-Murder: 
 Ha Huh man I'm tripping out right now 
 Thinking about my motherfucking brother K-L 
 That nigga used to talk about going to the motherfuckin NBA 
 And doin' this and doin' that nigga I'll never forget 
 I remember in the days how we used to dream 
 Now a days my life just ain't the same 2X 
 C-Murder: 
 I remember growin' up, with 5 kids we ain't have nothin', 
 But each other and I think damn I miss my brother 
 I give a shout to my mom she was there for me, 
 Even though sometimes I felt she never cared for me 
 Packin pistols wasn't even in my frame of thought 
 We had a problem it was understood that we fought 
 And Money wasn't even on my most wanted list 
 It wasn't really necessary just to pull a check 
 And even though I didn't have a dad, 
 I used to thank the lord everyday for everything I had 
 To all my lost thugs I miss ya well, 
 I can't forget ya I got ya picture in my cell 
 And uh I never use ya name in vane, 
 But it's a shame how you'll never get to share my fame, my nigga 
 You never saw your son face to face but rest a sure that ya family straight 
 'Cause I remember 
 Magic: 
 I remember sittin' in the hallways of school teachers lookin' at me funny, 
 "Magic why you ain't in class", 'cause I'm tryin' to make some money 
 Watchin koochie pass waitin for the bell to ring, 
 'Cause I got a pocket full a dirt that I'm gonna blow on my friends 
 I'm headin straight to the streets where I learn the game, 
 Me and my niggas rushin home where we stashed our cane 
 I went from student to dope dealer hangin' out with straight killers, 
 I did better till I met the Millers 
 I remember livin' lies slowly doin' so bad so broke I had no where to go 
 I was wearin the first pair a Jordan's after the fourth pair came out 
 I messed around and dropped out tryin' to make me some clout 
 I never worried about my education I was confused 
 I thought thugs ran the nation until I got on probation, 
 I remember that's why I thank the lord every day 
 Took me out the game showed me the right way to get paid 
 I remember 
 Chorus (until the end)
