 Keep your eyes on the rollers nigga. 
 Pass the weed (ok)

 We gon' pick up Pimp C, and Bun B (that's my niggas there) 
 We gon' get rowdy rowdy and 'bout it 'bout it 
 We gon' handle our business

 We gon' make it back to the N.O. 
 'Cause you know whut?

 We got love from the South, East, West, to the Nizorth 
 But it's your time baby 
 We gon' handle our business 
 And we gonna do this shit like g'z 
 We gonna represent the gizame 
 Ya heard me? 
 (Pimp C) 
 This game fucked up 
 I ain't got no friends 
 I done spend my last 70,000 dollars on a drop-top bienz 
 Ugh, and I'm a real nigga 
 Down to put a forty-five to his hilfiger 
 Lay it down muthafucka because I'm bustin' for mine 
 Take them out every time and I ain't try to dine 
 Niggaz dyin' port authur (huh nigga what?) 
 Thank that I'm playin'? (huh nigga what?) 
 Bust 17 times and let 'em feel what I'm sayin' 
 UGK and C-Murder 
 Cadillac and a Tank (Master P) 
 Bout to fade the platinum 
 Smoke some dank and some drank 
 But bitch luv me when I come to your city 
 Serve my dick out her pussy 
 And bust my nuts on her titties 
 Ugh, it's just a matter of time before I'm up in your house 
 With my mask on my face and my thang in your mouth 
 Now get your mind right nigga (mind right) 
 And make a pimp bitch 
 And never put trust in a trick ass bitch 
 I'm fingida pull akickdoe! (ugggggggghhhhhh!) 
 Lay down on the flo' (flo') 
 Want the cheese and the money or everybody gotta go (gotta go) 
 (Bun B) 
 They try to run up in the manger (run up) 
 Now hold oon Bun B 
 I see me P and C in danger (danger) 
 Just like the ATF, HPD, and Texas Rangers 
 Fuckin' with me and my middle fanga. 
 But to this shit nigga we ain't strangers 
 But I Gotta bust my magnums 
 Gotta gage these pistols 
 Hand grenades, and land mines 
 Chopper smoke bombs and missiles 
 Some of them bitches whistle 
 Some of them bitches silent 
 But all them bitches handle business 
 All of them violent 
 'Bout it 'bout it and dangerous 
 Soldiers that wanna gang with us 
 Bang with us, hang with us 
 Get that No Limit slang with us 
 I came to bust every ass in my way till it's over 
 So get the chip off your shoulder 
 Fix your lip 
 I done told yah 
 We own 5 on your bitch in your bumpin' conflicts 
 Nigga I can see that you got plicked 
 Sit down and take a time trip 
 This ain't nothin' ta sneeze at 
 The fear in your eyes I see 
 Bitch where's the key's & g'z at? 
 (C-Murder) 
 Lay it down muthafucka 
 Everybody gotta go 
 Give me the loot is what I tell 'em 
 When I kick in the doe' 
 Nigga I'm mad at the world 
 For my lack of havin' papers 
 Fuck the law and the cops 
 'Cause I'm down for a caper 
 (Master P) 
 Some say we dangerous 
 Especially when we broke 
 I'm mo daily than a dope fiend fiendin' for dope 
 I just live for confetti 
 You see I'm deadly like Freddy 
 I run through your house and leave it messy like messy 
 (C-Murder) 
 I got to much stress in my head 
 I wanna take my own life 
 My last chance is a 211 
 But it got me thankin' twicee 
 It's a drought right now 
 So these drugs ain't happenin' 
 And if it wasn't for No Limit 
 There would be no money or rapping. 
 (Master P) 
 You see my boy had a bumper full of keyz and g'z 
 The word on the street is his homie told his baby momma to freeze! 
 You see you can't trust nobody in this dope game 
 Keep your eyez on your enemies 
 Stack some chips and get out man. 
 (C-Murder) 
 Give me a ski-mask, a 9 
 I'll be a down ass nigga 
 And watch me pull a flee-flicker 
 And make my cheese get bigger 
 If I get caught it's 25, but that don't mean shit 
 'Cause if I go to jail it's gotta be better than living like this 
 Nigga 2 shots in the air 
 'Cause I ain't bout bein' broke 
 And if you bout I make a move 
 Nigga, everybody gotta go 
 Just some 'bout it niggaz from New Orleans 
 With tapes hooked up 
 C-Murder, Master P, and UGK 
 Now Nigga what? 
 (Chorus till fade)
