(Chorus) Akon 
 See everybody wanna fake and pretend 
 But me I'm tired of goin' in and outta the pen 
 I'm done with disobeyin the law 
 One false move and I'll be back in the yard,(This is for my thugs) 
 If I had a choice I wouldn't do it again 
 Ill unload the clip and conversate with my friend 
 Now this thing shouldn't be that hard 
 I done lost my dog now I'm fallin' apart 
 (Verse 1) C-Murder 
 They got me caught up in a situation, hectic, got me crazy like glue My homies dyin' for colors, but me I'm ridin' for true 
 See I ain't sidin wit you, I'm always dodgin the blue 
 I got two records on the rise, I'm only signin my crew 
 Forever loyal, no lyin' 
 No broken links, come try 
 Ima rep the CP3 until the day that I die 
 Daddy threw it at me, but then I threw it right back 
 Tried to hit me wit dat curve, but ima fool wit dat bat 
 Now how you like me now, I'm gettin' bigger, and richer 
 A third world villain, come here shorty take a picture 
 Still thuggin' in the streets all day, just a lil bit 
 You see dem cutboys loadin, now that's a real click 
 Straight goons wit sum change, bust brains, maintain 
 I'm the same lame wit sumin to gain 
 So I pray for 'em tryna cross, 'cause I'm the boss 
 Papi's moves was false, now he lost, the streets cost 
 (Verse 2) C-Murder 
 I'm havin' visions of a nightmare, every suckas playin' me close 
 I'm on the cover of the source, with America's most 
 So many memories of thuggin', and pushin it to the limit 
 Didn't have it, I had to get it, them forces I'm comin' wit it 
 Them wigs was gettin' splitted, I'm tatted up ya dig me 
 Task was tryna kill me, railroad 'n' deal me 
 I had to make 'em feel me, no duckin 'n' hidin 
 200 on the dash of the whip I was drivin' 
 I hit the studio, let the pain flow 
 Watch the grange dro, rock that chain low 
 Calio the same coat 
 Dirty G, Porch Boy Rest In Peace 
 I won't let them bustas bury me mane, ima beast 
 Drinkin' 1 and 1's, 2 and 3's, and let my mind free 
 I'm against the wall, 'cause my enemies behind me 
 They wanna see me in the bin or the pine b, 
 I'm under the radar homie, you'll never find C
