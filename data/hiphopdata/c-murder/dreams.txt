Fuck 
 Sometimes I just wish I could sleep it off 
 'Cause I dream about things that I know that I can't have 
 Thing I know will never happen 
 Like a safe environment money happiness success 
 Niggas want static than he going to get it 
 I came up with blood money that means 
 I'm wicked I roll with nothing but ninos 
 So they call me a baller I wiped a niggaz ass 
 Because I'm not a talker 
 Took a flight to kali came back with some birds 
 Ten g's for a key from a nigga called dirt 
 I like to hear my mack eleven empty out a clip 
 Shot a fool up in the club and then I changed my outfit 
 Maintain and uphold my statis as a g 
 Niggaz kiss my ass because I got alot of money 
 Plain and simple niggaz leave huh when I don't feel'em 
 Because they know when they fuck up then I'm going to kill'em 
 Understand I was rasied where the young niggaz roam 
 If you wanted something nigga you had to get up on your own 
 All these want to be motherfucken 
 Ass hustlers better wake up and stop killing on another 
 Cause 
 I wish that life was a dream 
 Cause some times I wake up 
 And just want to scream 
 I live amounst the cut throats and the killers 
 Lord don't let my son be another victim
