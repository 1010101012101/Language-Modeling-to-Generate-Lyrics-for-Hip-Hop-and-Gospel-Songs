Can you tell the DJ, turn it up, turn it up? 
 Can you tell the DJ, turn it up 
 It's Young Speezy Baby, Colossal Entertainment 
 West Philly, baby 
 We be up in the club till two in the morning 
 Bottle of Patron and the ladies still yawning 
 Pocket full of money but the girls call it play 
 Dough up in the club like two in the morning 
 Up in the club till 2 in the morning 
 Bottle of Patron and this boy still talking 
 All up in my ear but I ain't trying 
 To hear that up in the club till two in the morning 
 I say shimmy, shimmy y'all, shimmy, yam, shimmy, yah 
 Give me the beat, so I can take it away 
 Young Speezy baby and back on the block 
 Middle finger in the air screaming, fuck the cops 
 I keep the Philly blocks, hot all summer 
 Manage to stay low like troy the boy wonder 
 The J-Irvin of the game stay fly from the foul line 
 I bang down on you lames 
 I'm in the club with two bad women 
 By the end of the night I boned two bad women 
 I stay clocking a grip so holla at me Young Speezy baby 
 Back in my spot so get at me 
 Can you hear me?

 Then what it is? 
 Louie flip flops expose the toes holla 
 At the Caucasian broad but she don't do negros 
 Screaming cool darling your entitled to your opinion 
 But your girlfriend here, she never been up in the beamer 
 Open the sunroof, drop the top on the coop 
 3 inches on her shoes watch her chicken noodle soup 
 This is why I'm hot crossfire circle the block 
 Young heat rock, I'm on fire minus the rock 
 And I'm cocky wit it, distribution gave me my swagger 
 Versatile so no problems with the dilemmas 
 Can you hear me one of the illest and realest 
 Guilty at the arraignment, Colossal Entertainment 
 Can you hear me?

 Then what it is? 
 I'm back, back by popular demand 
 Climbing the charts of the game like Spiderman 3 
 Blowing my Mary Jane 
 Flow game insane boy doing his thing 
 Eyebrows are raised 
 And they mention his name on MTV 
 What happened to him, no what happened them 
 Oh, the nerve of he, for trying to stop me so 
 I'm sucka free, threw the industry 
 And, um, I don't mean no harm 
 But this Colossal squad, yo, we don't need them 
 And we don't need him, and we don't need her 
 All I need is this green so recognize a gee and I be
