Nothing for nothing means nothing 
 Gotta do something muthafucka punch ya in the mouth 
 Hitman, Oschino and Sparks, criminal records 
 Talk to 'em yo 
 This is for my ghetto niggas 
 Reputation is everything so go at with ya life 
 It's just like credit the minute ya fuck up you ruined it ya know 
 Yo as young adolescents (aha) mommy said we was so precious 
 I mean who knew round to O.D to Heron and I'd catch cases 
 Let my life slip inside the hands of these judges 
 Where did we go wrong ha? 
 Was it these missing father figures? 
 Or watching mom struggle and feed us 
 Come on I need answers 
 It's gak on the judges for turning burners on niggas who try to merk us 
 On the day of judgement who knows 
 Until then we'll never know so for now I'm a do Omilio 
 Drunk then a muthafucka disrespecting bitches 
 Attitude still the same fuck these niggas until it's my time to go 
 You know I'm doing no changes shit plus I'm happy to be here 
 With my new family, Black Friday and them Rocafella niggas 
 I'm focused bring the chorus in 
 My life make me want to holla sometime and throw in my hand 
 But I won't fold you know how I roll 
 I live that life of a trouble man and play by the code 
 Where I'm from just make me want to holla sometime and go get my gun 
 Go all out but I think of my sons 
 Then I look where I was at how far did I come 
 You see lady's prostituting wearing tight leopard 
 My sneaks was dogs like Pit bulls and German shepherds 
 Fuck where it came from I needed money fast 
 White boys bangin' Led Zeppelin went in twenty bags 
 So I got my first pack on fifty first and Market 
 I ain't want clothes I just wanted some boss to mark it 
 No moms to call no dad to be 
 Stuck on the streets stomach growlin' like a dog showin' his teeth 
 Life ain't sweet life ain't a game 
 I know life is more real then Slick Rick chain 
 Everybody get a hand so play the hand you dealt 
 And there's nobody to blame fuck it blame yourself 
 You can go all out and try to reveal 
 Like a nuclear staying how you write in a cell 
 You just better pray a liar and hope you prevail 
 I know living in the hood is hell, come on 
 My life make me want to holla sometime and throw in my hand 
 But I won't fold you know how I roll 
 I live that life of a trouble man and play by the code 
 Where I'm from just make me want to holla sometime and go get my gun 
 Go all out but I think of my sons 
 Then I look where I was at how far did I come 
 Yo right now I'd like to take the time to thank my family members 
 And phoney homies for turning they backs on me 
 Make me stronger help me deal with snakes and side guys 
 Going but I was grooming like a rodent 
 And I swear these streets will turn us boys to men 
 I'm the pain with juice and gin try to stack them Horace Grants to a million 
 Playing Caesar how I blessed them bitches 
 Excuse my arrogance but baby clone me 
 This petty world a kill me slowly take away my grandma mami hold me 
 Life obstacles is getting stressful that's why I don't come around 
 Written between the paper line examples of my lifestyle 
 So read inside the guidelines ain't no sunshine 
 Until you break the chains and fly freely 'cause I know for a fact 
 Somewhere out in the world somebody need me 
 To make 'em smile and appreciate 'em believe me 
 But main'tain in the main while baby 
 Omilio'll be there for you knahmean shit I'm a trouble man 
 (Chorus: Repeat 2X) 
 My life make me want to holla sometime and throw in my hand 
 But I won't fold you know how I roll 
 I live the life of a trouble man and play by the code 
 Where I'm from just make me want to holla sometime and go get my gun 
 Go all out but I think of my sons 
 Then where I was at how far did I come
