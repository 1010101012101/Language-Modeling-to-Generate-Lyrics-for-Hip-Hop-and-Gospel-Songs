 Baby come and get me if your ready to go 
 She's da diggin' me heavy 
 She wants to rock steady 
 Prolly gone beat like the trunk of a Chevy 
 I'm raw like the red meat, 
 At the party like confetti, 
 Girl on your marks, get set, get ready! 
 And we can get it on, 
 We ain't gotta stay 
 Girl, we can get gone 
 Head to the club- while driving 
 I'd like to get head to the club 
 Bring a bed to the club 
 So we can make love in the club, 
 Pop bub in the club 
 Never been petty 
 This a club banger that's radio ready 
 And I can rock ya world, 
 Go hard if you let me 
 Don't waste no time 
 My boo thang ready 
 She ready to go, 
 Lookin' like she really wants a big deal, 
 Universal 
 Girl I signed a big deal 
 We ridin', 
 Ridin' on the big wheels, 
 We rollin', 
 Spinnin' like them windmills 
 If I put it on ya 
 Prepare, get ready 
 We can hit the telly 
 "143" to my celly 
 I date hot girls' 
 My girls got buns' 
 And when it comes to the trees 
 We keep tons 
 Get paper like refunds 
 Burn paper till the trees done 
 On the TV like a re-run 
 Cha-Cha-Cha Choosin'

 Hunny who you foolin'? 
 Pa-Party on

 You turn me on, sweet baby 
 Come, come along 
 Oh, Come along

 Sexin' and Rockin' steady, 
 Oh, girl, you look so ready!
