Harlem! 
 Who else gon' hold us down? 
 Huh 
 You In! 
 Vado! 
 Say what? What you mean what you need ma? 
 Ya, you doing your thing ma 
 Ass crackin', seen outta your jeans ma 
 Let me place a single right in between ma 
 Ha, late nights, you could let 'em in 
 Tell a friend, tell a friend how much chedda spin 
 Most Definite 
 Whatever my crew at, it's most definite 
 You ain't got no wings in me casa 
 Marciano hoppin out a benz like a mobster 
 Pasta, pellegrino penne a la vodka, lobster 
 Filipino talk it to me proper 
 Uh huh, whoa! 
 You go slom, it's your time (Slom!) 
 Throw your credits in the air and let that gold shine 
 Tell me something I wanna hear 
 Trish, coke and heels is nothing you wanna wear 
 Put your friend on she wanna stare 
 Chicks like airs every week I wanna pair 
 It's a family affair 
 Only the fam here 
 Whole Harlem uptown we stayin' here 
 Chrome bottles, bracelets and chandeliers 
 You know Vado ain't rich but damn near 
 (Hah) As long as his man Cam there, 
 They like Reema with Sam running the tan chairs 
 Like what you said there 
 Nuff talk with the g-4 on the land will
