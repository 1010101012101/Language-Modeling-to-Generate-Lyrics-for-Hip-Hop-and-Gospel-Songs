Is it all over my face? 
 You've caught me love dancing 
 Is it all over my face? 
 I'm in love dancing 
 Is it all over my face? 
 You've caught me love dancing 
 Is it all over my face? 
 I'm in love dancing 
 Passed out 
 In a shady 
 Hotel room 
 With a hooker 
 Faced down 
 In the restroom 
 The cockroaches 
 In hypnosis 
 Sippin' what's left 
 Of spilled mimosas 
 That hotel 
 Was so cheap 
 I should've brought 
 My own sheets 
 He wanted it 
 And I wanted to 
 What's left to do 
 I paid for the room 
 I'm greasy, grimey 
 Ttwo-timey 
 Butt-sniffing animal 
 And if I want it 
 I get it 
 I'll eat that ass 
 Like a cannibal 
 I don't care 
 If you think 
 I'm dirty 
 I am dirty 
 Learn me 
 I masturbated 
 Till my KY faded 
 Unh 
 I'm exhausticated 
 It's all over your face 
 Tell me how does it taste? 
 When the lights go off 
 And your head goes down 
 Don't let 
 A drop go to waste 
 Go to town now 
 It's all over your face 
 Tell me baby 
 How does it taste? 
 When the lights go off 
 And your head goes down 
 Don't let a drop 
 Go to waste 
 Is it all over my face? 
 You've caught me 
 Love dancing 
 Is it all over my face? 
 I'm in love dancing 
 Is it all over my face? 
 You've caught me 
 Love dancing 
 Is it all over my face? 
 I'm in love dancing 
 Baby, it's all over your face 
 Looks like you've been eating paste 
 I came too close in your direction 
 DNA on your complexion 
 I don't care if you scream 
 My neighbors are all asleep 
 I thought of that 'fore when I closed the door 
 But I left open the screen 
 Your exact words were rock me 
 And so I did some bukkake 
 Don't stop me 
 Lock your legs in that position 
 Duck tape on your mouth so listen 
 Ease on out and I want it 
 If you didn't, why'd you flaunt it? 
 You've got me under your skin 
 On your skin I could come again 
 It's all over your face 
 Tell me how does it taste? 
 When the lights go off 
 And your head goes down 
 Don't let 
 A drop go to waste 
 Go to town now 
 It's all over your face 
 Tell me baby 
 How does it taste? 
 When the lights go off 
 And your head goes down 
 Don't let a drop 
 Go to waste 
 Is it all over my face? 
 You've caught me 
 Love dancing 
 Is it all over my face? 
 I'm in love dancing 
 Is it all over my face? 
 You've caught me 
 Love dancing 
 Is it all over my face? 
 I'm in love dancing 
 It's being all the same 
 It's all over your face 
 It's being all the same 
 Tell me how does it taste? 
 It's being all the same 
 It's all over your face 
 It's being all the same 
 Tell me how does it taste? 
 I should've brought 
 My own sheets, own sheets, own sheets 
 That hotel 
 Was so cheap, so cheap, so cheap 
 I should've brought 
 My own sheets, own sheets, own sheets 
 That hotel 
 Was so cheap, so cheap, so cheap 
 Is it all over my face? (It's all over your face) 
 You've caught me 
 Love dancing 
 Is it all over my face? (Tell me how does it taste?) 
 I'm in love dancing 
 Is it all over my face? (It's all over your face) 
 You've caught me 
 Love dancing 
 Is it all over my face? (Tell me how does it taste?) 
 I'm in love dancing 
 (It's all over your face)
