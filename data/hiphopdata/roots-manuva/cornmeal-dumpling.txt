Coming through with the hallelu vitalisation 
 New talk sensation, vibe see vibration 
 Spitting on the bacon is my first result 
 You will never see this folk juckin in this pork 
 Wild blast from the chalice 
 Flood my blood stream, this blessing sting 
 Cleans my mind to a gleam 
 See the light my tips see be tight 
 With these intergalatic tackles to the core 
 Raw from the south of the thames 
 Bringing folks vision like a contact lense 
 Nothing but this ital, vital world roots recital 
 We don't follow fashion, nor fad, not at all 
 See me to town come fe nice up the ball 
 'Long side the holy ghost, living like some pastor 
 Casting out the spell of this man made hell 
 Cornmeal dumpling give me strength y'all 
 Rebuke devils, make devils repent y'all 
 Hey 
 Flavour too dead, now they call me abortion 
 My look to twist a torsion made force uncontained 
 Pen 'em too hard he just might twist your brain 
 'Cause I grace track with roots vibe syntax 
 Funkified, footloose like the old farmer slacks 
 I enter the arena with some next type of juice 
 This has the energy, clipping from the noose 
 Freeing up my mind, from that living dead fluck 
 Devil eyes have fe get to the hell from these mortals 
 We won't stop cry for little beady 
 Step up, stand up, you know you got qualities 
 And so we groove and so we gwan and so we skid 
 Motion splendid with this routique we fine 
 Fending of the heat of this shall bar-be we flame 
 Times is dark, we can't feel no shame, but 
 Cornmeal dumpling give me strength y'all 
 Rebuke devils, make devils repent y'all 
 Hey 
 Cornmeal dumpling give me strength 
 I sing, who's discoteque is this 
 It's my discoteque 
 I don't give a dam how you wish me to flex 
 Imma flex how I feel to flex 
 Light-years over the heads of heads 
 Who study cool, I know they fool 
 All you had to do was to be yourself 
 Who am I? hey 
 Who's discoteque is this 
 It's my discoteque 
 Who's discoteque is this 
 It's my discoteque 
 And I shall be 
 I don't want to be 
 I do
