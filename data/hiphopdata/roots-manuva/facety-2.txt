Boat race (repeated) 
 Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh Uh huh Uh huh (repeated) 
 Yep 
 Elevated poetry flowers it's all flowetry 
 Power prepare honours to honour deep, I'm on it so 
 Here for hours and hours and here shedding them tears of joys [?] of noise, not too 
 Got forgot to get got or get me 
 What did you do, you don't you don't sweat me 
 T for technique but fear not the passion 
 We smash you little half hearts 
 Beating you back to them 
 Boat race (repeated) 
 Uh huh, Uh huh, Uh huh Uh huh Uh huh (repeated) 
 Yep 
 Holding it down, holding it down, holding it down 
 Men in the ground, men in the sound, men from now 
 We was out, from the found, in the foundery 
 Kicking it down, every ground, of a boundary 
 Shaka Shaka yes, Zulu Zulu now 
 Got the spirit now, they can't fool who now 
 Got the tool to do the must, do the get down 
 Got to get loud don't fear nor fret now 
 Tear the Tet techniques in your boat race 
 Hold a space I lace the bar 
 Par for par play the part yep 
 And never partly 
 Collect more scars than a 
 ?
