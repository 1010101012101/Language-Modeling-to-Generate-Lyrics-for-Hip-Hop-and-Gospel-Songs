If I could only make you understand 
 Then I might make this place a perfect land 
 But there's too much, too soon, too little 
 Too late 
 Some people call me Rodney 
 Some people call me Roots 
 That's that bloke that knows today's crews 
 But that's all right I back at crews 
 He world of Nike trainers and the world of nice suits 
 Expensive wrist watches, expensive groves 
 In the vent that I don't earn nothing (ha) 
 I'm bound to sell all of these things 
 My bling? Yes 
 And rightly so
