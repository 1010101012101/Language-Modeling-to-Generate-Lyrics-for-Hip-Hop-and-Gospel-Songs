Got to keep stepping hard 
 Got to keep stepping hard 
 Move by the mountain never seen a mountain move 
 But look at what the mountain do 
 Mole hill or mountain what be you 
 Situations amounting stopping you 
 Reaching for the top so we gotta be careful 
 It's so beautiful and I'm so tearful 
 Weeping at the mountain what are we here for 
 Just a minor morsel looking at the portal 
 I caught you looking at my speck of dusting 
 Disgusting because I'm always in a rush thing 
 Can I ever be more like the mountain do 
 With the mounting dew to be here for way much more 
 Than I could ever think of living 'cause when I think of living in my heart I'm kidding 
 Slow death kidding myself yet to die 
 Way much more than I'm yet to live 
 Will me see my his new is mine 
 Hear me see I live no is mine 
 Stepping hard 
 Stepping hard 
 Got to keep stepping hard 
 Got to keep stepping hard 
 My tongue do speak for the meek bring in meat bring in veg 
 Word said 
 Feeding the head with a pledge for the get go never let go 
 Holding on to the cause like rebels with no cause like 
 Most annoyed bringing the joy, with the joy yes we do rejoice 
 In this true born spirit of rap we never hold back chat that motivates black to do the cock 
 Take the plot thick with that holy ghost got from the cock pit fly over the moon with do do 
 Truly with the bride that's R in the July 
 Grace most given and the fort amazing 
 Wavelength made and it shall be done 
 Stand back and await the abundance come 
 Stand back and await the abundance come 
 Stand back and await the abundance come 
 Will me see my his new is mine 
 Hear me see I live no is mine 
 Stepping hard 
 Stepping hard 
 Got to keep stepping hard 
 Got to keep stepping hard

 Hear me see I live no is mine)

 Perpetually 
 Inside that deep 
 Sweet lady

 Hear me see I live no is mine)
