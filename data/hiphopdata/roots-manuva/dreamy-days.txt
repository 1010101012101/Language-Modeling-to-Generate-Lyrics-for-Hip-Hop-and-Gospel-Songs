Dah dah dah dah dah, dah dah dah dah dah dah dah, dah dah dah dah dah 
 La la la la, la la la la 
 Dreamy days, (la la la la) come what may, (la la la la) we feel no way (la la la la), 
 There's gonna be fun and lots of laughter 
 Dreamy days, (la la la la) come what may, (la la la la) we feel no way (la la la la), 
 There's gonna be fun and lots of laughter 
 I'm just a long foot barely talk 
 I might take of my shoes wan' take of my socks tonight 
 Take a little peep under that frock tonight 
 But there be no body pop pop tonight 
 You know my style I keep it on a holy outta body mind blown 
 We in some zone 
 So how deep can we sow those seeds 
 And procede to buck the limit? 
 Spinnin' in a whirlpool, essential peek 
 Messin' around with all these chemical rushes 
 When natural highs come a whole lot cheaper 
 Sweet to Geha got me singin' baby baby babe 
 I got the sudden urge to misbehave 
 I want to take you away from all the stresses 
 Buy you nice flowers and expensive dresses 
 You don't believe me, you think I'm cheesy 
 Dreamy days, (la la la la) come what may, (la la la la) we feel no way (la la la la), 
 There's gonna be fun and lots of laughter 
 Dreamy days, (la la la la) come what may, (la la la la) we feel no way (la la la la), 
 There's gonna be fun and lots of laughter 
 I want to feel ya, I want to know ya, I want to hold ya 
 But at the same time situations are complex 
 Cause you got particulars, I got particulars 
 Old circles are sick of us 
 'Cause we're walkin' down a primrose row 
 To everything and nothing 
 So can you picture past the honeymoon 
 Where you beat me with a wooden spoon 
 And you got me sleepin' on the couch 
 Now I'm thinkin' who's house is this? 
 This is my money, this is my pain, these are my drugs 
 This is my brain, and it's never gonna be the same 
 Dreamy days, (la la la la) come what may, (la la la la) we feel no way (la la la la), 
 There's gonna be fun and lots of laughter 
 Dreamy days, (la la la la) come what may, (la la la la) we feel no way (la la la la), 
 There's gonna be fun and lots of laughter 
 I'm a one man powerhouse succeeding within the scene 
 Son of the sir, livin' the love livin' the dream 
 Whippersnappers get jeolous it's true they don't know 
 'Bout my x amount of heart break years of low dough 
 We professional we dealin' with business 
 Revolution creep up slap you on the nose bridge 
 Touces in the back room gettin' the dutch 
 And these women in my black book they all quite posh 
 Still I wash my own brief wash my own socks 
 Some cocks y'all the horny bastards gressy polls 
 Square peg in a round hole too much show now 
 Some say I'm arrogant some say I'm laid back 
 From a council fact payin' higher rate tax 
 Who's the daps, who's the geez, must be me, Manuva MC 
 With a second LP for all of the girls I got the vitality 
 It's my 
 Dreamy days, (la la la la) come what may, (la la la la) we feel no way (la la la la), 
 There's gonna be fun and lots of laughter 
 Dreamy days, (la la la la) come what may, (la la la la) we feel no way (la la la la), 
 There's gonna be fun and lots of laughter 
 Dreamy days, (la la la la) come what may, (la la la la) we feel no way (la la la la), 
 There's gonna be fun and lots of laughter 
 Dreamy days, (la la la la) come what may, (la la la la) we feel no way (la la la la), 
 There's gonna be fun and lots of laughter
