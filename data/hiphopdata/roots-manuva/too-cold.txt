(Intro) T, Too Cold, T, T, T, Too Cold 
 I'm too cold, I'm too cold, I'm too cold 
 I'm too old, I'm too old, I'm too old 
 And it shows, and it shows, and it shows 
 And you know, and you know, and you know 
 Sometimes I hate myself, sometimes I love myself 
 Sometimes I hate myself, sometimes I love myself 
 Ah where the fuck man? 
 We can't stay brup man 
 We never stuck man 
 We on the up man 
 I do my nut man 
 Puke up my gut man 
 I'm a such and such man 
 I don't know much man 
 I pay my dues man 
 Now I'm confused man 
 Scabby vampires wanna run, come along come use man 
 The same old news man 
 We bring the blues man 
 My baby left me beacause I wouldn't buy new shoes man 
 We win or lose man 
 Don't ask me for a twos man 
 Buy your own fags man 
 Mind you get stabbed man 
 Don't you see that we some big broad bad man 
 Born and bred in this big bored bad land 
 Known all over the world as a mad man 
 Life is hard but it's just too bad man 
 I spoke with my money 
 This ain't a joke money 
 Banana boat money 
 Banana vote money 
 Food on a plate money 
 Real or fake money 
 Lose or take money 
 At times I hate money 
 It's money that makes money makes people act funny 
 Civilized men start to act gunny gunny 
 Take your life in a second with the right kind of money 
 Life in the west we obsessed by money 
 Mind how you worship, you can't be blessed by money 
 I do the best with all my money 
 Progress with my money 
 Invest with my money 
 Touch breasts with my money 
 Get sex with my money 
 Get vexxed with my money 
 Respect for my money means I feed my tummy 
 Blessed be my pound, get my food down dummy 
 Rhyme scholar from the school of the hooligan 
 Backing out the tool once you get too hectic 
 Smacking up the bwan turn the bwan is epilectic 
 I'm on some next shit 
 Dudes respect it 
 I'm the eclectic 
 Known for my eccentric 
 You can't prevent this I'm the God blessed God sent this 
 Uk rhyme saviour, no never quite 
 That was just some media totallaty hype 
 I ain't the best MC, or the worst MC 
 But I got certification I'm the first MC 
 I flip the flip, the new flip, the old flip 
 I zip my lip but I still zip my... 
 Get drunk quick 
 Don't done this shit 
 That's the bwan Smith 
 Nothing to prove 
 Mad at the moon 
 Now they too long to tune 
 Loving these boobs (?) 
 Seen too many crews with all of my views 
 Roots Manuva who the hell is it, MC, MC 
 And furthermore that's the only MC 
 The only MC
