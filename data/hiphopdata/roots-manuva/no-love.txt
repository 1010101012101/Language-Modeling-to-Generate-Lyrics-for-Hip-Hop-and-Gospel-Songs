We're gonna do it like 
 We're gonna do it like we're supposed to do it 
 Don't nobody got no love for Smith 
 There ain't no peace, there ain't no justice 
 And it seems like much of a muchness 
 But right now I really couldn't care much less (repeat 2x) 
 I'm the lost, the found 
 The good penny, the bad pound 
 Getting me down? 
 That's the reason for me dancin' 
 I shake my tush to the pictures in the music 
 Immune to the decadence, I found some meaning 
 Places I've been in, slapping the demons 
 Cleansin' the heathens, Lands End to St. Stephen's 
 Rhyme with no reason, son of the 5th season 
 Soon as I'm on the case, soon as I'm leaving 
 Artisan outlaw, long-time looney 
 Black George Clooney, moody in the midnight 
 15 tablets, check my prescription 
 I seen these shrinks and they say I'm too pristine 
 I said I'm too sta-quo with a government health risk 
 See my todger with the luminous piss 
 Wayward son of a Johnson, no Charlie, no Bronson 
 Steady we on some, lookin' to lump sum 
 Pull up a gumption, thanks for your function 
 There ain't no assumption 
 She said me no son, please bring the lotion 
 For good body touching with the good body motion 
 Bitter or habitual 
 Flinging my bling-bling, this my inkling 
 To walk with the in-thing 
 Outernational ghetto, hoo-rah 
 Big time passion, splash the hoopla 
 Cigars on push bikes, first-class flights 
 First-class trains, people look at me strange 
 They don't know my name but they know my pain 
 'Cause I'm the stupid in the corner getting steadily canded 
 As the hip-hop Holy Ghost touchs my spirit 
 I'm spiritually uplifted, that's what the punches did 
 And now I'm known and I'm prone to the feeling of havin' a buff pocket but still wanna kill all in my family 
 Idiot life, you shoulda taught me better 
 From the very first day, when I very first met ya 
 I seen the trends, the fads and the phases 
 The (whole host of points of view? / the old host of 'Points Of View'?) brought to the stages 
 The sound of 'P' made me feel more conscious 
 Tuned up my mind to the systems design, but 
 Those were the days, the era of "yester" 
 Now the whole scene's progressed to pimps and OG's 
 Now I'm the fogey kickin the bogey 
 With nothing in between and no place for me 
 Yes I'll take to the trends and split the cliches 
 I'm a pimpernel man, UVA 
 Defender of the soul peeing soul decay 
 Cause everybody... 
 Chorus out
