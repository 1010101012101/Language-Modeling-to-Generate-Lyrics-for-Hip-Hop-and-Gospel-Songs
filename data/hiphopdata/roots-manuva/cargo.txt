On a plane in a play 
 Fahrenheit how they keep a plane keep a pain 
 Return shall be tighter now 
 Never tiring to state case the worst case in the first place 
 Holding space well 
 That's the definition of a grown man vernacular 
 Back to front with the word power the sonic 
 Hurl the pearly whites stuff covered in vomit 
 How sick do we get when you pay your due now 
 Knowledge of yourself shall stay with you 
 In the day when they say the dogs day is through 
 Can't say that the brain ever planted food 
 Old fuck man work staying out of the loop 
 But the passion will speak 
 Without speaking 
 Original blueprint don't need no tweaking 
 Surveillance reveal power of the spiritual 
 Learn your love, and hold it unequivocal 
 Will you leave me here alone, alone 
 Will we need an easy way, we go 
 Will you leave me here alone, alone 
 Will we need an easy way, we go 
 A day and a time defined by materials 
 Acquire the stuff we dying we needing for air 
 Increasing the suffering more relief here 
 There's more power to the core belief here 
 The Sloganeers and the nouveau-revelists 
 Trained to take the bait of big business 
 The global elite remain invisible 
 Minority rule a few the illusion 
 So I will stay blessed I will stay 
 Dedicated to the quest I will stay 
 Put patience to pay I will say 
 Unafraid to engage I will say 
 ? 
 To the plane it maintain at getting up 
 For a stronghold it can't be too down 
 Whole world should be ready to be shook down 
 Will you leave me here alone, alone 
 Will we need an easy way, we go 
 Will you leave me here alone, alone 
 Will we need an easy way, we go
