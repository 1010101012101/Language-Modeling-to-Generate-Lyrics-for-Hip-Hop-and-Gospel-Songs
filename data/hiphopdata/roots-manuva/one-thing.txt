OK y'all. The simple truth is... 
 One thing leads to the next thing, leads to the next thing, leads to the next thing 
 A simple thing, money. Look at him money 
 Comes to my head, like it came to a head 
 O crack it off, look at these eggs 
 Poached and scrambled, my preamble 
 Amble's over, no Land Rover 
 So what the heck are you doin' in Surrey? 
 You don't look new, you seem to ate money 
 How could we hate the queen, when the social 
 Bill seems so obscene and it helped to create the scene 
 That put the people where the people be here 
 And its also open lee here 
 Got the taste for the finest E here 
 One thing leads to the next thing, leads to the next thing, leads to the next thing 
 A simple thing, money. Look at him money 
 Damn fool I am I lost my cool, o hooligan 
 It's where the ish began, walkers crisp ball crisp be yan 
 Lookin' all Christian, the geezer called Jesus is the leader of a gang 
 My gang flow do promote the holy ghost, praise his name invoke the holy ghost 
 When I shake my tambourine I shake that ever so keenly 
 My only wish is to get a Lamborghini 
 My girlfriend loves snakeskin bikinis 
 One thing leads to the next thing, leads to the next thing, leads to the next thing 
 A simple thing, money. Look at him money 
 One thing 
 Oh baby
