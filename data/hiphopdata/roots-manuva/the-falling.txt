Guns, bitches, hoes, crack 
 Death and disease, and a baseball bat 
 S T D's that have no name 
 Down at the clinic with a face full'a shame 
 Russian Roulette with a naked flame 
 Dangerously slow but in the fast lane 
 A big nose bleed and a bag of cocaine 
 Just got the news about the tumor in my brain 
 Just don't care so we sniff it all the same 
 Caught my best friend sleepin' with my girlfriend, Jane 
 Now I'm thinkin' of a way to get them slain 
 Assassins for hire, they shall get paid 
 Two-G, Three-G, whatever it costs 
 None of those fools shoulda got me crossed 
 I'm just about ready for some treacherous thing 
 Hand grenade on the plane looks another dunblane 
 Mass murderin', brains on the floor 
 You're dead 'cause I said you shouldn't live no more 
 You done and made me lose my cool 
 Where's my tool? Who's the bigger fool? 
 Road rage, pavement rage, all kind of rage 
 You'll be lucky if you get to see some old age 
 Every other day's a good day to die 
 Best be careful, if you's love your life 
 You don't know nothin', you don't see nothin' 
 You don't be nothin', you don't do nothin' 
 But we all got to be something and somebody 
 But everybody here can't be that rich 
 You know the sayin', 'Life's A Bitch' 
 I got my finger on the trigger with a nervous twitch 
 Keep your mouth shut, help me dig this ditch 
 Don't you be a stupid bitch 
 I took a blunt knife and cut a piece of my heart 
 That's my sacrifice, my wayward device 
 It sound mad though, my self-mutilation like 
 Doctor Fosters and his very first patient 
 The God's ain't happy 'cause man is praisin' himself 
 Plannin' to get to Heaven with that earthly wealth 
 Blood money, grudge money, nobody budge money 
 Mass futility, souls on the guillotine 
 Meantime I unravel, callin' Jimmy Saville 
 Come fix my epitomy I'm bitterly the bitterness
