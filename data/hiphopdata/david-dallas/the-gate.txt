And somehow say goodbye 
 Pretend I'm yawning 
 The hottest tears in my eyes 
 I'm just tired, right? 
 It's an early flight 
 I had a late night, packing up 
 Couple files I was backing up 
 Guess I'm starting acting up 
 It's hard enough as it is 
 If I don't go, I can't say that I lived! 
 And then it will be impossible to forgive myself 
 I don't try to make a better life for us ... 
 Is all I've got! I wish there was another way! 
 Wishing that the industry was closed and the home, 
 Cause every other day I set and guessing myself 
 Asking if I really got it 
 My worst fear is that you'll ever be out of pocket. 
 All I ever wanted to be was a bread winner 
 For everyday I stick around here my chance gets slimmer 
 My faith gets thinner 
 And try something that you can't take with you! 
 Wish I could take your load, take your load 
 It will be easier to carry this load 
 Take your load, take your load 
 It will be easier to carry this load! 
 That's my plan 
 But it's boring now, they just call out my name 
 So my feelings won't change 
 But it's just no more I can do for us 
 If my mind wants to stay 
 Thank God you feel the same 
 Tell me no tears at the gate! 
 Know that I'll be back again 
 Thank God you feel the same 
 There will be no tears at the gate! 
 If I try and... alive 
 But if I've cut the head off, then we won't survive! 
 I hop this bond is strong enough to stop the guillotine 
 'Cause I know that you'll be missing on the little things! 
 And so I missed them, kissing the morning, missed them 
 I got the work, mister reassurance talks 
 The massage on my shoulders hurt. 
 Missed your touch and it's nothing to replace that 
 Hope you're never stupid enough to think you can forsake that! 
 Do something you can't take back 
 I know you feel the same! 
 I hear that worry in your voice, I don't feel the pain 
 Promise soon things will be real again 
 And we can visit all these places that remain! 
 One thing's for sure is my feelings will never change 
 The... try something that you can't take with you! 
 Wish I could take your load, take your load 
 It will be easier to carry this load 
 Take your load, take your load 
 It will be easier to carry this load! 
 That's my plan 
 But it's boring now, they just call out my name 
 So my feelings won't change 
 But it's just no more I can do for us 
 If my mind wants to stay 
 Thank God you feel the same 
 Tell me no tears at the gate! 
 Know that I'll be back again 
 Thank God you feel the same 
 There will be no tears at the gate!
