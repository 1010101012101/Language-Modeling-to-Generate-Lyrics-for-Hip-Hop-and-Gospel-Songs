I got the new world in my view 
 On my journey I pursue 
 I said I'm running, running for the city 
 I got the new world in my view 
 I got the new world in my view 
 On my journey I pursue 
 Lord said I'm running, running for the city 
 I got the new world in my view 
 They ain't got no muscle, no hustle 
 No backbone, I stand alone 
 Not tripping, just saying, I'm different 
 Ain't hanging on the coattails of the next man 
 Passport in my left hand, thinking that you are next 
 Heck, hope you ain't holding your breath, man 
 'Cause I'm out here, I'm hungry, I don't play around, trust me 
 Ain't hexed my drive since my Honda Civic got rusty 
 And my girl said she loved me, it's funny 
 Thinking back, study hard for that 9 to 5 
 Like I thought that I'd be good with that 
 I was dreaming, still dreaming, spoiled it on me like Willie Beanie 
 Sip it for me like cappuccino, we stuck around in tuxedos 
 With my peoples, we growing up 'stead of seeing others slowing up 
 Ten squad, we thought we know every time that we showing up 
 Get it while I'm living 
 All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking 
 So I'm 'bout my business 
 And I'm running, I'm running 
 I'm running with them, yeah 
 They don't wanna give it up 
 We gonn' make it ours 
 Get it while I'm living 
 All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking 
 So I'm 'bout my business 
 And I'm running, I'm running 
 I'm running with them, yeah 
 They don't wanna give it up 
 We gonn' make it ours 
 Beats don't get no greater, feel like I'm on fire 
 Feel like I'm John Storm, feel like I'm volatile 
 Explosive, get close enough to notice 
 Your girl act out a character when she see me approaching 
 And pouching I'm just saying it's nothing 
 You punching above your weight, I'm something 
 She ain't seen no substitute in that A team 
 That's BA, barracks, that BS, that whackness 
 Get no play in my axis, make 'em jump like AJ Hackett 
 Guarantee you in these boots they couldn't walk one mile 
 I really need to go and hang it up like a drunk god 
 So behind the times they should probably rock till sun down 
 Shattering their dreams, I could make big puns small 
 Music from the soul, don't need them to help me 
 If they fiending for the flash, they should take another selfie 
 Said I'm running, I'm running like no pharaoh so deep 
 The whole world could go against me, it don't matter, man 
 Get it while I'm living 
 All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking 
 So I'm 'bout my business 
 And I'm running, I'm running 
 I'm running with them, yeah 
 They don't wanna give it up 
 We gonn' make it ours 
 Get it while I'm living 
 All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking 
 So I'm 'bout my business 
 And I'm running, I'm running 
 I'm running with them, yeah 
 They don't wanna give it up 
 We gonn' make it ours 
 The chase 
 Won't wait another day 
 All is falling into place 
 We ain't got much to lose 
 I wanna taste 
 Won't wait another day 
 All is falling into place 
 We ain't got much to lose 
 Get it while I'm living 
 All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking 
 So I'm 'bout my business 
 And I'm running, I'm running 
 I'm running with them, yeah 
 They don't wanna give it up 
 We gonn' make it ours 
 Get it while I'm living 
 All I ever hear is the clock tick, tick, ticking 
 So I'm 'bout my business 
 And I'm running, I'm running 
 I'm running with them, yeah 
 They don't wanna give it up 
 We gonn' make it ours
