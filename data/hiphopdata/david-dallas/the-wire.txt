Oh, oh, oh 
 Easy what you want could be another thing 
 It is the power of it's all. 
 Easy what you've got one minute it is here 
 And then another it is gone. 
 Oh! 
 And higher, and higher 
 I'm going out in 
 The wire, the wire 
 Is growing and buried in 
 And you can call it 
 But I never gonna won't let leave 
 The wire, the wire 
 Though it's giving out for me. 
 It's time to knock 'em down, it's time to run around 
 Acting crazy it's real, nothing from daisy 
 I'm ... ghost, I'm trying think, that's so fucking crazy the most, 
 It's keeping kids and that I'm at nature, the most 
 So will be playing thanks down, we'll be making jokes, 
 In case we choke rather make out all out while we did try, 
 We better shamed that we built a plane and then fly 
 Living lies man if only we can live and live, 
 Am I not be the great but it's good in the middle 
 And made the chess stars but the work that I live 
 And if you did it from the heart know the Lord forgive em 
 May nobody for bitches, from this first step, 
 On the high ride we can be the worst yet, 
 And be your best now I'm runnin' once or twice, 
 Know I'm on it ... my death, know I feel and keep it ... 
 I'm sustaining on the edge. 
 Easy what you want could be another thing 
 It is the power of it's all. 
 Easy what you've got one minute it is here 
 And then another it is gone 
 Oh! 
 And higher, and higher 
 I'm going out in 
 The wire, the wire 
 Is growing and buried in 
 And you can call it 
 But I never gonna won't let leave 
 The wire, the wire 
 Though it's giving out for me. 
 Yeah I track it to this life, 
 All of the side of it, 
 And what it seems still I wanna be a part of it 
 And I carry some skies from it, 
 You never know if you can carry a film 
 And if you never been the star of it 
 For the couple ... I'm going for he asking ... 
 Thought I'd be happy with that ... and you got it wrong, 
 I had to leave 'em behind, although we got 'em long 
 As the trains even today you even ruffle wrong 
 Don't know if I got 'em wrong, I live ... it up 
 Play some good defense and stick ... 
 Best shape of my life, I'm sick if it thug 
 Ain't upon me stay ... I bought tickets dough 
 And I conq with the show, 
 Though I know it's such a long way down but such a long way be now 
 That I forgot who I used to be, I'm doing this 
 Is the only thing that's true and me me
