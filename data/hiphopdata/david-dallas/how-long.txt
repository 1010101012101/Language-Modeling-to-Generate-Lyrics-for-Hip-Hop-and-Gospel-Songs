How long 
 How long 
 Pour another drink, hot on some Patrone, this is soda with this vodka 
 It's me in my zone, don't give me a speech, I don't wanna know 
 You should tell your friends to leave now, we should be alone 
 Don't tell me I'm wrong, just tell me how long 
 How long must I wait if we both feel the same way 
 All you gotta say is it's on 
 Girl, you are no actress, caught me with the dope 
 Fooling no one, whose intelligence are you tryna insult 
 With that act, I'm a smart man when it comes to affairs of the heart, man 
 Real fly, I just take off, baby, I can't land either 
 When you hear me out your speaker, get you high, Wiz Khalifa 
 Till you think that I'm a keeper, could be at home playing Fifa 
 But I'm out here talking to you right now 
 Can't hear everything you saying 'cause the music's quite loud 
 Talking 'bout how you're a student, you're in UNI right now 
 Nod about your boyfriend and how you tryna lose him right now 
 Don't be stupid, don't be foolish, I'm not clueless right now 
 Talking about a slumber party, me and you should lay down 
 Ah, jokes, but a lot of truth is said and I wouldn't mind be a fly on the wall 
 If you were getting dressed 
 Oh, you thought about possible places you could rest your head tonight 
 And you probably thinking mine 
 Pour another drink, hot on some Patrone, this is soda with this vodka 
 It's me in my zone, don't give me a speech, I don't wanna know 
 You should tell your friends to leave now, we should be alone 
 Don't tell me I'm wrong, just tell me how long 
 How long must I wait if we both feel the same way 
 All you gotta say is it's on 
 How long I gotta wait before we go on a date 
 I'm a baller but I got that mean, independent trait 
 Generating all the winds, you and your mates all attend 
 You should bring them to the place, maybe we can get it in 
 Baby, with the pen I'm crazy, is anyone you hail 
 We can share a wild moment while we bumping Jessie Ware 
 Yeah, you got that scent, that flare, that's so rare 
 I'm open, what you packing in the rest, got my player card revoking 
 Smoking on the green mixed with the codeine mixed with ... 
 Had to tell me that you came right, hear you got a man 
 Well, he ain't like me ...as high as aeroplanes 
 We both know your boy's a lame, what you doing? You should leave him 
 You play them wicked games, what you doing for the weekend? Let me know 
 Pour another drink, hot on some Patrone, this is soda with this vodka 
 It's me in my zone, don't give me a speech, I don't wanna know 
 You should tell your friends to leave now, we should be alone 
 Don't tell me I'm wrong, just tell me how long 
 How long must I wait if we both feel the same way 
 All you gotta say is it's on 
 Man, I love the ...I can't say that I love but I can say that I love to ah 
 And I know I'm blunt but I'm just too grown for these games 
 Little too cold for these lames and I really do like your demeanor 
 Hey, your attitude is fiery and I feel airy in your presence 
 Baby, don't deny me of these blessings, wanna intertwine with all your essence 
 In the dark let's embark, let's go and escape the sun 
 Wanna hear you say my name, say my name in your native tongue 
 You looking delicious, oh, them thighs, I just wanna bite them 
 Know you feel a lil' bit gone, a lil' bit faded, just don't fight it 
 See, I never was the player type 
 Couldn't see the point in being with a girl that you don't wanna make your wife 
 But you stay the night 
 I never do play, only when I'm single ... make the most of this time we have 
 When we close, can we toast? So baby, grab a glass so you can 
 Pour another drink, hot on some Patrone, this is soda and vodka 
 It's me in my zone, don't give me a speech, I don't wanna know 
 You should tell your friends to leave now, we should be alone 
 Don't tell me I'm wrong, just tell me how long 
 How long must I wait if we both feel the same way 
 All you gotta say is it's on 
 Just tell me how long
