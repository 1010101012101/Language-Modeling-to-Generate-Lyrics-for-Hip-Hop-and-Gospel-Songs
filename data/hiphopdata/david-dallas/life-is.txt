From the pacific isle of Samoa via Middlemore, 
 And still as raw as the day a little boy was delivered dawn, 
 Delivering non-fiction, all real, no silicon, 
 But sitting on a gold mine the way I've been killing songs 
 Underdog but ain't tryin' play this position long 
 The top cats is looking weak I look gorilla strong 
 Ain't kidding dog king kong ain't got shit on me 
 Worth the currency I'm flyin' but ain't got weed on me 
 You can catch me on a long hall riding Air New Zealand or Quantas 
 Me and Che hit the states with no sponsors 
 And accomplished more than most these fuck head labels did 
 Even though they had untold grimes to pay for shit 
 Pushing trash indie bands whose resume is paper thin, 
 The place once ... they never by once they play again 
 ... I put money on the ... I don't' have 
 And say fuck it if I fail ... so bad bee in ... I'd rather rick and be a jerk 
 And things is really living life when me and you ... home 
 I'm tryin' see the world they're just tryin' to meet some girls 
 And get in the club for free for ...splurch... on my dick when I reemerge 
 ...They just ... bitch say it with 
 You think music sucks, now there ...majority 
 In a ... they probably ...and we don't even have those ... 
 People ...taking down so I'll blow up ... 
 But great stories don't know if get told ... I just hope song... 
 Ironic 'cause for that I need a ...an icon... 
 ...Burn the fucking CD ...on your eye for play it in the car 
 There's some shit that you can vibe on 
 ...It's been a while ...keep the lights on
