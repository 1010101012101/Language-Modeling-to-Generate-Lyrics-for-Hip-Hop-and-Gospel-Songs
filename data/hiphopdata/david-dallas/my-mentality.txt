Ice running through my veins, I'm the coldest, just give me half the time 
 I be running with it like I stole it 
 You would notice if you paid attention properly and play the lottery 
 I work with better odds, my favorite game is Monopoly 
 You copy me, get it? Understand I'm a prodigy 
 Ain't no stopping me and my movement, man, this is prophecy 
 This probably the reason why the trying to sell economy 
 Ever far along in the sequel, but no apology 
 You ever hear inaudibly come from my lips 
 Like Beyonce adding aberrations, ain't gonna say shit 
 Won't be no prerecording it either, I just give them the ether 
 Freddie up on the feature, you should know the procedure 
 Fool, don't act like you don't hear the chicks singing the song 
 Y'all made me a believer, out to get it at all costs 
 Like a young mob boss, go getter, going out like this was V for Vendetta 
 Trend setter, I'm the coldest 
 You're drawn to the side 
 S with the line, flew in, bout to fall from the sky 
 Just some thoughts for the mind 
 I'll take a glimpse at the time 
 What's the plan? Believe the world is mine 
 And my mentality is money orientated 
 Money orientated, anything for the paper 
 And my mentality is money orientated 
 Money orientated, anything for the paper 
 Fuck the world and everything in it 
 Drive away from the pigs, the same thing really 
 And if you... then we got them fangs in it 
 454 in my motor, work with some change in it 
 Jumped off of that label and started my own shit 
 Don't need no nigga to hold my dick, bitch, I'm all on my own flip 
 Say my attitude like Nicky from the zino 
 I'll probably die buried alive, Freddy Tarantino 
 Keep your shoe box and your rubber bands 
 Rocking dope, I'm racked up ...I lay back in my lectra 
 Every nigga from my hood tryina make 100 stacks plus 
 Looks like every nigga is born as actor, get wrapped up 
 All I wanna do is smoke a stoggy and get loaded 
 And go fuck with my old bitch and my new hoe got demoted 
 But once I'm with this dick, I don't know, she might just jump back on it 
 Got my dough hoe and my blow right off the coast of California 
 Bitch, we robbing, bitch, you holding 
 You're drawn to the side 
 S with the line, flew in, bout to fall from the sky 
 Just some thoughts for the mind 
 I'll take a glimpse at the time 
 What's the plan? Believe the world is mine 
 And my mentality is money orientated 
 Money orientated, anything for the paper 
 And my mentality is money orientated 
 Money orientated, anything for the paper 
 Money orientated, legacy on my conscience 
 Long as I did it my way, then fuck a pro, I ain't bothered 
 Don't bother popping off with the lips 
 Like dropping the flame in a Molotov mix 
 Now with your best in, ...fuck a flame thrower 
 Harder than the south, bitch, we can't change, came over 
 Painted over your little tags with end to end burners 
 I've been a quick learner, to win, I went further 
 ...How to drive like ... 
 Put my foot to the floor so hard that I broke the pedal 
 Killing everything you think that I made a pact with the devil 
 Ain't no high strings that you can pull on so fuck Geppetto 
 I'm my own puppet master, pour a glass of vodka, sitting in mi casa 
 You ain't in my clasa, you bastards are further just stall my ability 
 Got you sweating me but I never feel the humidity 
 My AC is on, nothing in this world that can take me on 
 So pump your breaks, be gone, I'm looking way beyond 
 What's within my reach, I'm tryina grow my wings, span till I got down some beat 
 From Oakland City, the new Deli to Gary, Indiana 
 The world gonna be my oyster and don't come on a platter 
 If they don't wanna bet it, they know I do 
 Then I'mma keep taking it as long as I'm alive 
 So try stopping me, man
