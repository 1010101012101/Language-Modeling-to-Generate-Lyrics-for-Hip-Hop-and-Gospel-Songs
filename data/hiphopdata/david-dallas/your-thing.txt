Now get it up, put a one in the air 
 Say a mother fuck the world with umfnth stare 
 There's something in here that gets me jumping out of bed 
 Feel I'm on a brink and in here there's something much bigger 
 Than what we become we having with some we have have become 
 Something else, two for chain if you just use your brain 
 You get view that's so clear you hear we all ears 
 Appears its pandamonium cash be loaded get a tank of petrolium 
 Hash and opium the things of a has been got a be on my ps and qs 
 Are appropriate you just be quiet p know what its about 
 Yeah I'm gonna cure but we ain't doing so well 
 Oh well I was always told there would be bad days 
 But you will benefit a soul with a sad face 
 Its infectious and vice versa a little smile never hurt ya 
 Specially in the university social structure 
 See my clothes see my shoes I suppose you could say 
 I fit those stereotypes are holding away 
 Now my role is my role I just role everyday 
 Do my thing like I don't know which road I should take 
 Do my thing 
 Do my thing 
 Do my thing 
 Do my thing 
 I spit rhymes in the week rhymes on the weekend 
 Buy me a speech I speak to the kids I'm a heethen 
 Most frequent speaker of the expletive, no defence in not under pretense 
 I got a couple of qualities that make me a good dude, 
 Couple of qualites that maybe I could do without 
 Switch routes so maybe it's an understatement now let me let me let me come straght with the facts 
 Kick back a little bit too much, for some would say that I never grew up 
 If I ever blew up id lift the whole crew up to the sky pull a p diddy on the fly 
 With a party in the atmosphere, autopilot on drinking what's the crack in here, 
 We back in here, still an nfl thing bling, let the bell ring I'm just developing 
 On this solo tip know this ain't no so so shit.nope... 
 See my clothes see my shoes I suppose you could say 
 I fit those stereotypes are holding away 
 Now my role is my role I just role everyday 
 Do my thing like I don't know which road I should take 
 Do my thing 
 Do my thing 
 Do my thing 
 Do my thing 
 Your thing... 
 Your thing... 
 Your thing...
