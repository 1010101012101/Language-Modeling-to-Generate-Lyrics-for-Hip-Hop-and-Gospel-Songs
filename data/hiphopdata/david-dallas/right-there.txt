So just keep it right there, keep it right there 
 If we don't keep it down, down somebody might hear 
 Let me make this quite clear, that I don't care if you don't 
 So if you're feeling me, scream my name girl you go 
 Don't try to give me kudos, know I'm numero uno 
 Can never question why game, we ain't laying kudos 
 It's more like doing Judo, gotta know what to do though 
 It's a context sport no knowing this could be... 
 Feeling like I'm from Pluto, another world 
 Know you ain't feeling these other dudes that make you wanna hurl 
 Listen girl, roll with the wind there's no more bad luck, maybe later 
 You could be stripped like a stat shot player, haters 
 Tryna cut my grass they ain't never done a lot 
 Slowly getting ...I'll always be the grass, win the lot 
 High fucking, high feeling like a younger nas 
 Put the accolades and the only thing that's coming fast 
 Keep it right there, keep it right there 
 Said this could be a breeze 
 Keep it right there, keep it right there 
 Stop listening to me 
 Keep it right there, keep it right there 
 Real, real, real 
 Keep it right there, keep it right there 
 Take notes 
 You've been talking up the game, make sure not to do the same 
 The promise overdue, never sold my soul to do my fame 
 Worst the river I'm expecting some ribbon 
 I don't mess with the chicas, hit me 2 pops 
 See what happens from here ain't really set in stone 
 Plenty dudes step into the place when they're tryna get you home 
 Or just tryna get you for, I'm not tryna doing either 
 I'll be studying the night, pulling an all nighter so 
 Roll around if you want a tutorial 
 All I do is practical, I'm not into boring you 
 Theories for the lecturers, I'm not tryna tutor you 
 Your brain responds better to some 1 on 1 schooling 
 Get the feeling that you're learning quick 
 Get the feeling that you're really trying to please 
 Like someone who works for tips 
 Get the feeling you could murder this, so keep it right 
 There girl instead of turning quick 
 Oh yeah 
 Keep it right there, keep it right there 
 Said this could be a breeze 
 Keep it right there, keep it right there 
 Stop listening to me 
 Keep it right there, keep it right there 
 Real, real, real 
 Keep it right there, keep it right there
