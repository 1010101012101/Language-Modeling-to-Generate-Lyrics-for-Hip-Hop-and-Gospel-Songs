Stepped up in your town, came to shut it down 
 Not tryna step on anyone's toes, just do my thing and bounce 
 If you lost our whereabouts, where we are I couldn't pick it on a map 
 So don't think I'm tryna move in with you cats, just relax 
 Don't feel threatened ...version of Wayne, too 
 As if he on, too, tryna stunt on me 'cause he's been on a plane, too 
 It's not a big deal, not tryna show out, you know... 
 Like he got money to blow out, knows the bounces, gets them thrown out 
 King of the clubs but he's never left his home town 
 And you can keep your women, bro, don't be mess talking us, we just slipping, bro 
 This all be really famous in your city, bro 
 I'm sorry I ain't in it, bust it, take a pitch and throw 'em 
 I know what's going down, everywhere's the same 
 Round here it's like cheese, everybody knows your name 
 You're a local celeb, right, local celeb, right 
 Local celeb, live the local celeb life 
 I know what's going down, everywhere's the same 
 Round here it's like cheese, everybody knows your name 
 You're a local celeb, right, local celeb, right 
 Local celeb, live the local celeb life 
 Girl, I know your type, posing on that Instagram 
 Tear into every other guy, I hear like it's a mess way that you don't give a damn 
 What these other girls think 
 And tell a snobby belly qualify to serve drinks 
 Never worked a real job but you model sometimes 
 Heard you an actress, too, you hosted club nights 
 You tryna sing as well, you really love the lights 
 Long as they're on you, who gives a fuck, right? 
 Don't hate the player, hate the game 
 You might just date a 40 player for the fame 
 You wanna be all right, just to be a name 
 But look too thirsty and it just makes you a lame 
 I know what's going down, everywhere's the same 
 Round here it's like cheese, everybody knows your name 
 You're a local celeb, right, local celeb, right 
 Local celeb, live the local celeb life 
 I know what's going down, everywhere's the same 
 Round here it's like cheese, everybody knows your name 
 You're a local celeb, right, local celeb, right 
 Local celeb, live the local celeb life 
 I seen stars before and you ain't one 
 Picked up a brush, it doesn't mean you can paint, some 
 Sparkles up and you thought you could take one 
 I tell the true stories and I hate all the fake ones 
 I seen stars before and you ain't one 
 Picked up a brush, it doesn't mean you can paint, some 
 Sparkles up and you thought you could take one 
 I tell the true stories and I hate all the fake ones
