 (Verse 1: Soulja Slim) 
 I'm a dick thrower 
 Her neck and her back hurting 
 Cut throat I'll have you like a brand new version 
 I'ts like when she get used of it then you start serving 
 Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jicky jerking 
 Slow down for me you moving to fast 
 My fingers keep slipping I'm trying to grip they ass 
 Keep being hard headed and Ima make you get of me 
 Got human up the skys but my face is a doggy 
 If you loving my bark let me bury my bone 
 I got 4 or 5 bad merry bitches at home 
 One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick 
 That outside dick keep them hoes sick 
 (Verse 2: Juvenile) 
 I'ts like I got the world in my palms 
 Your girl up under my arms 
 She fucked up from the charm 
 She love the way the dick stay hard from 12 till early in the morn 
 Fine bitches if you listening you heard me I'm strong 
 If you going threw your cycle I ain't with It I'm gone 
 You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home 
 They wasn't telling the truth baby you know they was wrong 
 Na make it official where's some of that don 
 I don't mind buying to, your riding to 
 Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you 
 Lil mama my shit together I ain't jiving you 
 I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do ya know 
 And juvenile from courtless street by derby 
 Same nigga that used to be running with rusty and kirby 
 Can a playa from the n.o.ya get a chance with it 
 But I can't bounce widd you without using my hands with it 
 (Chorus: Soulja Slim) 
 Like uh I like it like that she workin that back I don't know how to act 
 Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me 
 Move it slow motion for me 
 Uh I like it like that she workin that back I don't know how to act 
 Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me 
 Move it slow motion for me 
 (Verse 3: Soulja Slim) 
 Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping that she don't leave my dick broken 
 With brush, burns and swollen 
 I'm toting she wanted me to make a outer believer 
 I guarantee ya ima see ya when I see ya 
 And just don't holla out my name like we was all that 
 Your pussy throw back and you know that 
 So stop stunting slow motion for a real nigga 
 I'm going off that incredible potion and imma deal with ya 
 (Juvenile) 
 I like how that victoria secret sit in that ass 
 Let me pour some more hip and hennsey in your glass 
 Would I be violating if I grab me a handfull 
 I'm knowing what's happening all I want is a sample 
 Who you wit I'm in the rental today 
 It's going down and happening and I remember the way 
 Less money we spend on bullshit the more for the weed 
 What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me 
 (Chorus 3X: Soulja Slim) 
 Uh I like it like that she workin that back I don't know how to act 
 Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me 
 Move it slow motion for me 
 Uh I like it like that she workin that back I don't know how to act 
 Slow motion for me, slow motion for me, slow motion for me 
 Move it slow motion for me
