(So Slim, do you have anything to say to the people?) 
 I'm a mothafuckin' Fool, and you, test my nuts 
 Not knowin', in guns I trust, and bust and put gats in the dust 
 You wanted some murder shit, well murder shit is what ya gettin' 
 I'm verbally spittin', got these niggas scared and shittin' 
 You fuckin' with the right one, soulja fo life one 
 Ain't no mothafucka like em 
 Where he at, show 'em to me 
 And I'm gonna strike 'em and bite em 
 And swallow em, for trying to be a follower 
 My deadly venom instantly kills 'em like a cobra 
 Leave it up to Magnolia 
 To shut 'em down and sober 
 Popped off and tokin' em 
 Break down and stick 'em and hold 'em up 
 And smoke it up with enemies 
 Claim to be friends with me 
 The whole while they into me 
 When shit don't make sense to me 
 Whodi got a bently, and whodi got a jag 
 Whodi got a lot of shit that Soulja Slim never had 
 But, I don't get mad and start hatin', 'cause that's bitch shit 
 If it wasn't for incarceration, I'd a been rich 
 I'm a fool 
 And I'm one of em, who likes to talk about what I'm about 
 Straight up tell ya to ya face what I'm gonna do 
 I'm a fool 
 These niggas fool hoggin, and ho hoggin 
 Drinkin' that hatorade, they don't wanna see me ballin' 
 I'm a fool 
 They can't stop me, they hoes jock me 
 How you luv that, baller block that 
 I'm a fool 
 I can hear 'em sayin' it now 
 That's a fool there, a fool there 
 (Knocks on the door) 
 Who's there?, it's me dog, me? 
 Where the fuck you was at when I was off in the penetentiary 
 When I was outta sight and outta mind 
 With only a handful of soldiers by my side, 
 Rest of my so called niggas was jive 
 But I ain't gonna say no names, 'cause they know who they be 
 So if you thinkin' I'm talkin' 'bout you, Fuck You 
 'Cause lately, I been feelin' since these niggas tryin' soulja hate me 
 That they wanna duct tape me 
 And knock me off, and drop me off, in the Nolia 
 But I'm shell shocked, clutchin' my glock, bitch I'm a soldier, 
 Beggin around fo some change, and come and get me 
 And I'm gonna be waitin' on 'em by myself with my pistols with me 
 Ain't nann nigga gon' ride, like I'm gon' ride for me 
 And ain't nann nigga gon die, like I'm gon' die for me 
 Believe that, I'm 100% real when ya look me up and down 
 You can see that, come back in the mix, and I'll be back 
 To touch somethin', hit somethin' and split somethin' 
 Quit stunnin', y'all niggas ain't killin' nuttin' 
 I'm a fool 
 I been there, done that shit 
 When I'm off in that zone, nigga, tell me run that shit 
 I'm a fool 
 Angola bound, uptown 
 Skinny ass nigga weighin' a hundred somethin' pounds 
 I'm a fool 
 I represents what I say 
 Ain't no fuckin' game here, ain't no instant replay 
 I'm a fool 
 I hear 'em sayin' it now, that's a fool there, a fool there 
 (Slim, do you have anything to say to the haters who say you can't 
 Make it on the outside?) 
 Remember this old sayin' a wise man change 
 A fool will stay the same 
 Fuck it, blame it on the game 
 Breakin' acid 
 Will I spend my life in a cell block or in a casket 
 Or will I get old and get my groove back like Angela Basset 
 Only time will tell, but until then I'll be stackin' my mail 
 By album album sells, Magnolia wear dwells 
 I love them bricks, I love the ghetto hoes 
 'Cause they gon' show ya what they workin' with 
 A lot of my little dogs, still be gettin' loaded 
 Walkin' around the project with the pistol out, talkin' and snortin' 
 Whodi don't give a fuck, 'cause they dealer got 'em gone 
 Bout that foolishness, and gon' jack somethin' with they jones 
 They remind me of me, old Magnolia Slim 
 You can break ya ass off in this sewer water tryin' to swim 
 It's polluted, I'm foolish
