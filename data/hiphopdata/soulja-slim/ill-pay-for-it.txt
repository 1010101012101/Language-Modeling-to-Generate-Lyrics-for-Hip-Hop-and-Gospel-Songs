(Soulja Slim) 
 Oh shit, (um, um), oh shit (um, um), oh shit (um, um) 
 (Verse One) 
 Look I like 'em with a small waist and nice hips 
 So when I'm hittin from the back I get a nice grip 
 I be sweatin like a dog and I might slip 
 So with the right incase I get a tight vice grip 
 I got that work and I just come from doin' time again 
 You can't skip you see the line that they standin in 
 Don't trip I got enough of dick for all of y'all 
 They say that I'm a dog right after I knock 'em off 
 She mad at me tryna get me out of my money 
 You gets nothin' from me you gon' be broke round the fall this Sunday 
 Believe that you gonna see that 
 I'm a thug ain't no love for the club rats 
 Yeah I told you I was breakin bread 
 But breakin bread to A Limit you heard what I said 
 I ain't stutter I'm a tricky ass motherfucker 
 If you a hustler let me see you work them booty muscles (get jiggy wit it) 
 I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it 
 I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it 
 If I want it, if I want it 
 If I want it, if I want it 
 I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it 
 I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it 
 If I want it, if I want it 
 If I want it, if I want it 
 (Verse Two) 
 I'm a leave some passion marks are fire red 
 Suck on that neck like a vamp when we in that bed 
 I'm not 'Jada' I stopped 'kissin' along time ago 
 I'm a playa and I don't put nothin' pass a hoe 
 Move on it slow but I'll move fast when I want that ass 
 They break camp got that rock haters throw the stash 
 I'm a holla I got Caramel waiting on me, Red hatin' on me 
 She think I really give a fuck that she skatin on me 
 What you ain't heard the news all of 'em confused 
 For everyone that I lose I bounce back with two 
 You in love with me I'm in love with you 
 Not mentally but physically what ya mouth do 
 Yeah that booty loose like a rubber band 
 I ain't make it like that, that's with that other man 
 I just started hittin it a few weeks ago 
 If you a pro let me see you make that thing show 
 (Verse Three) 
 Let me see ya walk makin' niggaz mad 
 She hatin' on you 'cause she ain't workin wit too much ass 
 I'm waitin on ya to make me and my dogg proud of ya 
 Throw that ass this way I gotta few dollars for ya 
 I'm hollerin for you I got three 50's and eight 20's 
 I'll give you these three 50's if you rollin' wit me 
 The rest goin' on a mothafuckin hotel 
 Soulja Slim got that work you can go tell 
 I got my doggs screamin on the Nextel 
 I'm a mothafuckin dog send me to hell 
 I fuck all these bitches, I fuck all these hoes 
 I'm a dog nigga, a mothafuckin dog like that
