 (Bounce dat ass) 
 When you see me in da club 
 (Bitch bounce dat ass) 
 When I catch you in da tub 
 (Bitch bounce dat ass) 
 When I catch ya at da pad 
 (Bitch bounce dat ass) 
 When I catch ya down bad 
 (Bitch bounce dat ass) 
 Y'all know when I'm in da club y'all know what I'm lookin' fo 
 Lookin' fo da bitch wit da biggest butt 
 A down south bitch, a gold mouth bitch 
 A bitch that'll make mah pockets rich 
 Wit da G-strang drowls holdin' on to da walls 
 Plantin dat ass right on a niggas balls 
 You give her a drank and watch act wild 
 She got more trick den a little bitty child 
 All mah niggas in da back 
 Niggas in da front 
 And me bout to smoke from da mothafuckin blunts 
 I'm gettin' high I really can't lie 
 I want to fuck da freak wit da tat on her thigh 
 Fuck yo baby daddy you can ride in mah caddy 
 I know you want to fuck 'cause you lookin' right at me 
 So bitch get yo mind right I know down bad 
 Lets go to da crib you can bounce dat ass 
 Hoe 
 Take it off, break it off, shake it off 
 Hoody hoo! 
 Girls in da club showin us 
 And da homies wit da big banks 
 Couple dollas fo da fish tanks 
 Thug girls wit da G-Strangs 
 Squat it down and make yo knees sang 
 See dem papa's like to ride it 
 And dem strippers work yo body 
 Kick yo legs like karate 
 And say wut up 'cause we 'bout it 
 (Ughhhh!) 
 Get down if you rowdy 
 If you a freak den shout it 
 Hoody hoo!
