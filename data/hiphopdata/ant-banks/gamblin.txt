 (Ice-T:) 
 Yo, What's up player 
 This is Ice-T, now you know Ant 
 I wish I could be there baby 
 Representin' with you, on this Big Thangs Album man 
 But right now, I'ma outta here on these Gamblin' 
 We got in the Mediterranean man 
 We just floatin' man 
 I'm up in them about 18.2 and the dice is hottin' 
 You know, a real player like me 
 Ain't gonna let these mothafuckers cool off man 
 I got to keep shakin' and rollin' 
 And you do the same god damn thing nigga 
 Don't let this game cool off 
 This is going out to the real niggaz 
 Now Ant, don't worry about them player hatin' bitches 
 Faggot-Ass-niggaz out there 
 They ain't never gonna have nothin' 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 There always gonna be me 
 How I do the real pimpin' to a player like yourself 
 Don't worry about them niggaz man 
 Step over them niggaz, you know what I'm sayin' 
 No need to fuck up your shoes steppin' on them 
 This is Ice-T, I'm up outta here like I'm stole somethin' 
 Seven, God damn, I'm losin' the Section 
 I'm out, I'm breakin' out, Awwww shit 
 Give me my money, give this bitch
