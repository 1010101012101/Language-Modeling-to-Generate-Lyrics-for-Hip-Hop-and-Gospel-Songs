Yo, stop breathing fog on my window 
 I reconfigured your pixel display 
 To disguise shut down system icons as OK buttons 
 Modems fronting on connection rates, 
 Switching COM port data transfer levels to 2400 Baud 
 I'm living large like 2,000 terabyte drives 
 In 30 90s just promoted to device manager 
 Check my stats on Britannica 
 Encyclopedia read only media 
 Hidden directories with password protection by all means 
 (You know my steeze) 
 My flow has encrypted and programmed to be equipped 
 With the ill shit that most can't get with 
 My linguistics bring the noise, making connections fail 
 Overload your box and now you know that 
 (You've got mail) 
 Minimize operations, control panel hiatus, 
 I dropped the DOS for analog 
 Studies of orchestration, it's obsolete, 
 1995 was then, now it's 1998 
 We're taking over this update, 
 Fuck Bill Gates, I macro hard 
 Take your processes for hostage 
 All the way from 686 to 808D HD imposter 
 Mini tower boxes stuffed with too many program ruled devices 
 Concise with mechanisms, 
 Call the crisis center 
 I'm IBM compatible with any Macintosh contender 
 Catch me lounging at the task bar, 
 The alcohol is on caps lock, picking up the tab 
 Shift my control to alternate delete you mother fuckers out the lab 
 Majik Most: 
 Fully activated forever in our workshops 
 The universal sysops adopt my protocol 
 We hack through break codes and step through 
 Busted windows where silicon chips grow 
 Crushing plastic landscapes from Pentium to any, 
 I can dust off broken keyboards 
 Restoring all mainframes and splice the phone line 
 On the internet I roam with carpel tunnel syndrome 
 Chrome plated Logitech direct me towards the nets intersect 
 Encrypting information, I damage workstations, 
 Defacing databases like a race for technology 
 Went deep in the sectors of a 1 gig hard drive 
 I'm live but with no type of power management 
 Prevent all viruses, search protect connec, 
 Now upload my (file's done) 
 Make your hardware go soft 
 Rhymes melt through your modem 
 'Cause I'm powered off radium 
 Waiting for selection of a hidden icon 
 A pointing device that can slice through menus 
 Continuing to wreck, dissecting all websites 
 Consuming the contents of a chat room, that's wack 
 I'll react, making servers collapse, now how's that 
 Drop 'em with the carrier of 300 baud 
 Navigating through directories and instant memory 
 Deep imbedded in your system 
 On excursion you can find me 
 Trying to download the 99 beta version 
 Not enough memory for your windows 
 Pow 
 All systems are down 
 Memory for your windows 
 Pow 
 All systems are down 
 Not enough memory for your windows, your windows 
 Windows 98 
 Goodbye
