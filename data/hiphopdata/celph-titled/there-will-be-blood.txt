Can I do it? (Yeah!) Can y'all do it? (Yeah!) ALL together now! (Ah) 
 [Scratching]: 
 "Ooh, ya love it" 
 [Celph Titled]: 
 If me and some rap faggot have static 
 We can go to war, at your show you'll need flap jackets 
 Strapped with automatics? 
 No we use bats and hatchets 
 Give the microphone a drug test, I spit crack at it (for crack addicts) 
 Approach your A&R with an AR 
 Based on, a true story, I spit H-bombs, in every eight bars 
 When Tony put his face in that snow 
 I was writin' them flavor flows 
 And yeah, even my worst haters know that I'm a player fo' sho' 
 They be like, "Yeah, I'm with ya Titled" 
 Bring bitches back to the pad like a menstrual cycle 
 You walk around like you some kind of thuggy guy 
 I know you ain't Diddy but I can make you see through Puffy eyes 
 (Sadat X) 
 You know my styles boy, you know what I'm workin' with 
 Fire arms of various calibers penetrate 
 I'm the hate that breeds hate 
 Nah, let me illustrate 
 Time stands still on a day that's slow 
 For me it ain't about the show it's about the proof 
 Blow the air from the roof 
 And anything movin' this is a stick up 
 If you fiends even hiccup you layin' flat 
 You wanna face this rage? 
 Somebody threw some meat in the cage 
 Wear armor 
 You can call Obama 
 Call your momma 
 I breed armies, make men out of boys 
 Tactical General Patton from BK to Manhattan 
 You frontin' 
 You lame, treat your whole squad the same 
 (Grand Puba) 
 I don't play when it comes to this 
 I rule the mic with the iron fist 
 Compile data then I make the list 
 Grab the wack, move they ass to trash 
 Then empty trash so they don't exist 
 Since vinyl 
 Words flow like herds of rhinos 
 Leave your ass trampled when I'm runnin' on the sample 
 A showdown at sundown, these verb-als I rundown 
 Will leave your ass dumbfound, you thought you was gunned down 
 Rhyme style mean like a dope fiend lean 
 Cut against the green and you face the guillotine 
 Grand Puba, there's no way you can dodge 
 Better off tryin' your luck at Las Vegas at Mirage 
 [A.G.} 
 Been through ups and downs, never touched the ground 
 Like girls with the big butts, never fuck with clowns 
 Let music take over me 
 Words flow through me 
 Truly the best that's why niggas keep quotin' me 
 I'm the baddest nigga livin', average niggas don't stand a chance 
 I danced in France, put hands and feets on beats 
 Put fans in trances 
 Amsterdam is, a place where I sin 
 Get that Yen in Japan kid 
 The Swiss Mountains, got a Swiss accountant 
 Chick with a fountain pen, keep my chips amountin' to somethin' 
 My grind is unparalleled 
 While y'all niggas keep on horsin' around like carousels 
 (O.C.) 
 I'm mind over 
 As a matter of fact 
 There's no practice needed 
 See, I'm matched bar none 
 When it's all said and done up 
 The last man standin' is proof 
 Who has the biggest brass and bubbas for crafty 
 McGuyver 
 E'vryday things around me work to my advantage 
 Create the plan at random 
 For every livin' soul on the planet understand this 
 As some author's say, "An heir is apparent" 
 I'm that oil piece, priceless art 
 There's no biddin' on it, auction block 
 Fortune of Fort Knox 
 Off top or written 
 Each album takes precision 
 Knocks out solidify win the fight over decision 
 (Diamond D) 
 I got a flow so cold niggas call me chilly 
 Don't ever press up fam, I'll smack you silly 
 If I'm all out of Dutches, I pack the Philly 
 On my J.O.B., I mack the millis 
 And I'm all about stackin' my chips 
 Gettin' dome in the back of the whips 
 Start smackin' them hips 
 All that slick talk will just gets you smacked in the lips 
 Game time fourth quarter, back to the blitz 
 You can't move me, shake me, break me, make me 
 Be somethin' I'm not 
 Niggas wanna snake me 
 I'm right by escape key, writin' X 
 Big Diam still writin' the checks 
 Holla at me
