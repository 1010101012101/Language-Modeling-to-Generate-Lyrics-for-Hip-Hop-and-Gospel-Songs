I already done heard enough of that faggot shit 
 Celph Titled comes through with matches lit 
 Causing gases ashes to form where your casket sit 
 I'm passionate smacking bitches on blind dates 
 An angry rap critic on top of that irate 
 At my estate we got room with medieval tombs 
 Dead people and priceless spoons that scrap brain on plates for Montezum 
 And I assume I'm about ten yards from you camp grounds 
 With kerosene filled to the brim of my canteens spilling on ant mounds 
 I play Cee-Lo with-out the dice and roll niggas head instead 
 'Cause I'm charitable and generous to give out the led 
 You shook bitches know I carry M72 L.A.W.s 
 With 66 millimeter rockets cruising above you 
 What? Your mother said she never love you? Well she told me 
 'Cause I'm that nigga to hold heat and make slugs outta your gold teeth 
 A sick muthah fuckah puttin' six muthah fuckin' slugs 
 In six muthah fuckin' arteries ain't mutha fuckah hard as me 
 (Sample: x2) 
 Every now and then a suckah MC gets courageous 
 Every-Every now and then a suckah MC get's courageous 
 Every now and then a suckah MC get's courageous 
 Never-Never the Least they all R.I.P.
