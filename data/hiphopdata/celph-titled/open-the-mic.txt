(Verse 1: Jay Love) 
 Yeah, unh, yo, let me spark this 
 I'm already wound up 
 Let's burn it from the ground up 
 Turn the fucking sound up 
 Allow chumps spitting on this underground cut 
 Come around, it's going down like the town slut 
 Keep your mouth shut, I'm quick to set it 
 Kid forget it, I get gassed and piss unleaded 
 Your shit's pathetic, split before your wig's beheaded 
 Disconnected and ripped apart like a Christmas present 
 Flip this record, we can battle on the instrumental 
 Battle to a quickened tempo, battle with a pen and pencil 
 Your girl's digits in my pocket, that's coincidental 
 But if they had a pimp Olympics, I would win a medal 
 I've been around them most of my life 
 I go to your show with a knife and start provoking a fight 
 Jump on stage just when the moment is right 
 And scream open the mic or the poet gets sliced 
 (Verse 2: Celph Titled) 
 Out the mouth comes fire 
 Who ignite the fullest 
 Celph Titled feed you led 
 Make you bit the bullet 
 Talk imaginary crime stories 
 And get dealt shots 
 Surprise you with the calico 
 And get shell shocked 
 And hell's hot, you don't want to get caught there 
 When there's warfare, we suit up 
 And carry fours in pairs 
 I'll rob a bitch too 
 Snatch her purse with the quickness 
 Not Jamaican, but I love to jerk chickens 
 Niggas disrespect, I never keep it on wax 
 We load up the vans with soldiers and fully loaded macs 
 Crashing through the windows of your crib 
 Blasting shots wearing navy seal suits 
 That look like astronauts 
 Don't give a fuck about rap 
 You talking thug shit, drain your bodily fluids 
 Now you lack substance 
 Whether east or west, you bring beef around here 
 I'll launch a missile to your city until the coast is clear 
 (Verse 3: Louis Logic) 
 Ay, yo, you feeling me 
 Well get your mittens out my trousers 
 Or we'll deal a beating out like a clique of rowdy bouncers 
 You sit around announcers got nothing to say 
 Like your girl when I'm standing up and fucking her face 
 Shit, we take shots like they don't affect us 
 With more rounds and quarters 
 Than bankers and pay phone collectors 
 I sip licks with thick chicks and stay so erected 
 Cause my dick fit in a slick slit like lego connectors 
 Hey, don't forget this, J-Love and Celph and J-Zone 
 Spit heat like they come from hell 
 When I'm pissy, I can dump as well 
 When I'm not, I'm just pissed off 
 So your two choices are lumped or swelled 
 Chicks tell me I'm something else, the way I eat snatch 
 In a pair of cushy knee pads and safety mask 
 And lately, that's been the reason they hate me rapping 
 Cause my dick disappear in your chicks mouth 
 Like baby aspirin 
 (Verse 4: J-Zone) 
 Y'all say Zone is a one trick pony 
 I say Zone got a long dick, blow me 
 The way y'all hate, the more the money come 
 I ain't been unanimously loved since I was 21 
 With Muisc for Tu Madre 
 My first LP, all that critical acclaim 
 I was up in Starbucks and couldn't afford a latte 
 But now I talk trash and bring hell to the people 
 You're not a broad or a bank teller, I don't want to see you 
 Too cheap to go clubbing, to ugly to model 
 Too broke to drink Crys, but I'll front with the bottle 
 J-Zone give a dime to a quarter, bitch please 
 Rich or poor, y'all ain't worthy to wash my drawers 
 A-R-C on the beat, me Odd Couple and Celph 
 Use your bathroom and pee on the seat 
 And fuck a holistic ho, I'd rather have a ho 
 With lipstick blow on my balls like a piccolo 
 (Verse 5: JJ Brown) 
 Now hold up, you can't have a jam 
 Without the engineer man 
 It's double J Brown in this bitch, yeah, yeah 
 I get into your psyche, don't care if you like me 
 You're pussy, even your lesbo flow is so dyke-e 
 Check the level of the treble, that's the five-g sound 
 The devils on a whole new level 
 When we roll through your town 
 'Cause it's the O double D 
 C-O-U-P-L-E 
 With JB on this banger courtesy of AV 
 It's hot shit, don't say you is when you isn't 
 Like jerking off with your left hand 
 That shit just feels different 
 And porque you want to act like you got that pimp shit 
 Cinematic heads know that my posse make hits 
 I heard you thinking, drinking is some shit that we say 
 But best believe I leave this rapper style dripping with Grand Marnier 
 Hip hop hooray, it's the end for your clowns 
 And leave your ho standing up 
 You sit the fuck back down, homie
