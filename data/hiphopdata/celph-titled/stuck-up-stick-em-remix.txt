(Intro: Celph Titled) 
 Remix mother fuckers 
 What you want mother fuckers 
 Celph Titled, Majik Most, Eternia 
 Mother fuckers, let's go, come on 
 Haha 
 (Chorus: Majik Most) 
 (Verse 1: Celph Titled) 
 I blow your mother fucking head off at close range 
 It's like you asked a bitch to suck your dick, 
 You got no brains, Hold down the trigger, 
 We got cases of belt ammo reloaders, 
 The barrel of my gun looks like a flame thrower 
 Rapid fire, clap your messiah, 
 But he a'int coming back in 3 days 
 Construction crews built a crack house over that fags grave 
 Looks like niggas went through airport security 
 No guns and no knives, a'int none of you is hurting me 
 I have the common courtesy to open doors for you 
 Throw you in the steam room and watch your corpse boil 
 You don't want to see me pull the Mac out on these bitches 
 And catch more bodies than there's Black Album remixes 
 You a'int hip hop, youse a snitch, 
 You only use microphones for wiretaps 
 And targets for me to fire at 
 But I a'int shooting apples off you head stupid 
 I'll shoot your Adam's apple out your neck 
 And stick a worm through it 
 (Verse 2: Majik Most) 
 Yo, I'll strangle you with baseball gloves 
 And catch a case 
 Crime watching binoculars zoom in on my face 
 See me on license plates once I step in your state 
 I'm repping with weapons you can't carry on your waist 
 Evil warlords with cannons and mortars 
 Samurai swords mined under the floor boards 
 Get flamed and torched 
 I'll jack your Ford Taurus 
 Launch it off a bridge, hit the water with force 
 Last thing you see is a squid and a seahorse 
 I'm the boss, top of the food chain 
 Macs blast that collapse your rib cage 
 Put the pressure on, break spinal plates 
 Make the Russian in Rocky 4 look like David Spade 
 Yeah mother fucker, put your rep to the test 
 Bitch I'm a stab so many holes through your vest 
 The doctor's like fuck it, I'm a golf on his chest 
 (Verse 3: Eternia) 
 Believe me when I say there 
 A'int no body that can get with us 
 You scared to bust the lyrics 
 Because you heard the DemiGodz dangerous 
 To hang with us or bang with us 
 Been talking about bite the dust 
 Fearful these adventures leave you with 
 Dentures and facial cuts 
 You think we playing? 
 Swing our sound every time we say it 
 Got you tracing back to the wreckage 
 Stay on, you best behavior 
 Plus you wasting time trying to get with mine 
 Think before you spit a rhyme 
 Fuck around and get left behind 
 Been rolling with the DemiGodz 
 Since Solomon had concubine 
 Before water was turned to wine 
 Before Romans created time 
 Now we shine 
 Rippling your back with the lab attack 
 Blacking out on track to perfection 
 Lessons that never lacked 
 You the reason why we write our rhymes 
 In this aggressive way 
 And never fearful 
 Always be tearful lying in heresy 
 That's how it stays 
 Days of spitting rhymes, It never pays 
 Until one false prophet 
 Jumps on stage and gets sprayed 
 I'm serious
