"On and on and on and on and on" 
 "Yes yes y'all as I proceed" x4 
 [Verse One]: 
 Y'all got Celph Titled questions 
 I got Celph Titled answers 
 On how I started, how I represent Tampa (the God city) 
 I know you're used to hearin' me on some wild out shit 
 Yellin' at the top of my lungs how my nine gon' spit 
 And I got more styles that's sick 
 And I've been doin' this since Fahrenheit 813 since '93 
 I've been makin' beats and writin' rap sheets 
 Mischievous teenage wither a creative outlet to release anger (uh) 
 Booty shake bass music, I was into that 
 Poison Clan, 2 Live Crew, that's what got me into rap (yeah) 
 Loopin' tracks with fast hi-hats and 808's 
 Four track machine with the high speed cassette tape 
 Now keep in mind, I was a fan 
 But as MC's we all are 
 And very few of us become stars (stars) 
 Went from blastin' Magic Mike to grabbin' a mic 
 Tried to sound like Spice-1 and not +Rapper's Delight+ (nah) 
 E-40 to Ice Cube 
 The west coast had a lot to do with the type of beats I'd write to (true) 
 But still the Juice Crew was one of my favs 
 Never discriminated whether New York or L.A. (word) 
 And around the mid nineties 
 I became fascinated with the Lord Finesse style of slick rhymin' 
 The Redmans, the Big Ls, the Das EFXs 
 Ras Kass, Chino XL type of records 
 So guess what 
 "WHAT?!" 
 Celph Titled emerged, bowlin' ball style 
 Runnin' through pins, author of murderous words 
 And I was set to rip every verse I put down 
 17 years old and at rappin', I'm pretty good now 
 [Scratch chorus]:

 [Verse Two]: 
 I'm from a city that don't have much hip hop roots 
 So I felt compelled to form a hip hop group 
 See I was once on some, go-against-the-norm 
 Flow fast and write rhymes in complex forms 
 It was kinda ill at the time (remember?) 
 Cause the only other choice 
 Was Puffy and Ma$e and they big willie club joints (take that, take that) 
 So I got my act together and eventually met two other MCs that rap together 
 We was all on that underground vibe 
 Cella Dwellas, Kool Keith, Tribe and Organized 
 I was kinda out of my mind 
 A weird guy 
 Cut designs in my facial hair and fucked around with beard dye 
 It was me, Majik and Dutch and we had a lot of fun 
 Thought we was smart, named ourselves Equilibrium (that's right) 
 And had a label called Atomic 
 With Walkmen and Kramtronix, layin' down cuts on it 
 I stayed pollyin' 24/7 
 And in 1997 started recordin' our first record 
 Then my phone rang, didn't know who it was from (who?) 
 Some guy who called himself, Apathy The Alien Tongue 
 Heard I had production and could rhyme too 
 He was from up north and knew some Jedi Mind dudes 
 Plus he had a crew better than any quad 
 A couple months later they was callin' me a Demigod (yeah) 
 I started shoppin' my demo aggressively 
 Landed on the desk of Budz Distribution/NYC 
 Next thing you know, I got a single on wax 
 And an offer for a job in New York so my bag was packed

 [Verse Three]: 
 Now I'm nineteen (nineteen) 
 A Floridian in New York 
 A white Cuban boy who says "nigga" and eats pork (wow) 
 So you can call me foul 
 But back then I didn't care 
 I would do whatever to catch a listener's ear (whatever) 
 So I submerged myself, in the local scene 
 New York Rican, Wetlands, Tramp, Speed, S.O.B.s 
 That guy Apathy (that's him) 
 He's from Connecticut 
 So we would link up and write songs to make records with 
 The label I was messin' with, they was feelin' it 
 So then we had vinyl distribution at our fingertips (ching ching) 
 The Demigodz onslaught was in full motion 
 Twenty singles in 2000 with no promotion 
 My name was everywhere, for beats or for features 
 But best believe I had a fuck load of nonbelievers 
 Masterminded an underground persona 
 Dirty mouth, punchline, wild animal, down to bring the drama (what?) 
 I made a lot of 
 Friends from Boston to Philly 
 Never thought this many heads would say they really feelin' me 
 So you gotta respect that 
 And when Vinnie Paz asked me to join the Army I was like, "Bet that" 
 Then Jimmy Iovine's assistant, insisted 
 That me and Apathy make a little visit for business 
 The deal fell through 
 But Atlantic picked Ap up 
 We expanded the Godz in L.A. with more rappers 
 Then Cage got smacked up 
 I remember punchin' him 
 I remember pressin' up his diss songs and chumpin' him (yeah) 
 I remember havin' him so scared 
 Chain smokin' in the backroom at his show just 'cause I was there (hahaha) 
 He was drugged up and panicked, he couldn't face me he was frantic 
 Snuck behind with a bottle and then he ran quick (bitch) 
 That's how a little man fights a giant 
 Cowardly lion and God strike me down if I'm lyin' 
 But I moved passed that (fuck it) 
 It's all gravy 
 I was on an album executively produced by Jay-Z (uh) 
 Tours with Mike Shinoda 
 Gettin' paper with Fort Minor 
 My worldwide exposure is a sore reminder (sorry) 
 To those who think I'm gonna disappear 
 But it's pretty obvious that I ain't goin' nowhere (nope) 
 I am a haters worst nightmare that got fans 
 And I gain more and more every time I drop jams
