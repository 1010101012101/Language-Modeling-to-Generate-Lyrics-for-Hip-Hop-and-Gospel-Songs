(Talking Intro) 
 Uh 
 This is goin' out 
 To everybody from the 90's 
 And even if you not from the 90's 
 Anybody that appreciates the mark that the 90's left 
 In my opinion, the greatest era for hip hop 
 It's like bein' a teenager during the great jazz era 
 So you can imagine what it means to me 
 Let's go... 
 (R&B Chorus) 
 It's like those days are still so fresh on my mind 
 Seems like yesterday when I started writin' my rhymes 
 And I miss those days when I look back over my life 
 Though things done changed, I miss those good times 
 (Verse One) 
 Shit'll never be the same, I can picture it but never explain 
 Memories stain every inch of my brain and pump through my veins 
 Grand Puba had the Tommy Hill locked down 
 And how that Cool Water smelled, back then not now 
 Backpacks and Starter caps, outfits didn't match 
 Which reminds me that the 90's was the aftermath of crack 
 Girls had their name on their necklace or gold cross 
 Overalls folded at the ankles with stonewash 
 RZA rockin' all them beats, Sega with the Altered Beast 
 Wasn't safe to walk the streets with Jordan sneakers on your feet 
 Rappers had you thinkin' white girls had no butt 
 And whiteboys either rocked a mullet or bowl cut 
 I'd give a muthafuckin' million dollars to go back 
 To Show with the "Soul Clap", K-Solo "Can't Hold Back" 
 Magic admitted he had it, but he ain't a addict or faggot 
 If you need 'em I got crazy prophylactics 
 (R&B Chorus) 
 It's like those days are still so fresh on my mind 
 Seems like yesterday when I started writin' my rhymes 
 And I miss those days when I look back over my life 
 Though things done changed, I miss those good times 
 (Verse Two) 
 Al Roker was fat, Ben Franklin's face was small 
 Too many Florida felons, then came that 3 strikes law 
 The Benz had the round lights, Lexus was the new whip 
 Crews were rollin' deep in Jeeps, smokin' on that Thai stick 
 Chocolate, Lambspread, before they perfected Hydro 
 5 dollar bag get you that Skunk or that Cambo 
 Kids bought CD's from Biohazard and Anthrax 
 Supersized fast food, what the fuck was a trans-fat? 
 Pam Anderson, Anna Nicole, Carmen Electra 
 I miss my beeper goin' off, I miss the G-Funk Era 
 Early to mid 90's was the greatest of all times 
 Pac, Biggie, Big L, Eazy-E & Pun were all alive 
 It was either flava or P-H-A-T 
 Arsenio, The Wayans and Martin Lawrence was on TV 
 These are oldies but goodies, difference of OG's and rookies 
 Shit was good when Billy Clinton was gettin' Lewinsky pussy 
 (R&B Chorus) 
 It's like those days are still so fresh on my mind 
 Seems like yesterday when I started writin' my rhymes 
 And I miss those days when I look back over my life 
 Though things done changed, I miss those good times 
 (Talking Outro) 
 Yeah, uh 
 Sinista, take us outta here 
 (Scratch Outro) 
 "I miss the days of way back then" 
 "I remember way back in the days on my block" 
 "Thinkin' way back about the good old days" 
 "Way back in the days, back in the days" 
 "Felt like yesterday, I was a shorty B-boy around the way"
