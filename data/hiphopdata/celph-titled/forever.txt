(Intro: L-Fudge) 
 Yo, You have now entered the realms of Rictor, boy, 
 Celph Titled the Rubix Cuban, 
 Complex Kimani of the master minds and L-Fudge 
 Aka emcee guy pollo, Palla plumas in the house 
 (Verse 1: Mr. Complex) 
 Yo, kicking it for divine minds, divine rhymes 
 Defy common space, mix New York with the A-T-L base 
 I've been hard to trace, leave evidence of existence 
 Play copy blocks with assistants assistance 
 Snatching necks snaps, fresh raps veterans and wet backs 
 Unbelievably fresh like wet naps, we set traps and set stacks 
 And light some rhyme books on fire 
 Master mind philosophy need to retire 
 To a higher plane, leaving the name engraved 
 Up in your hall of fame, keeping right at the train 
 With the same Walkman since 93, see I be 
 Holding it down for NYC, lively 
 The upper west resident, superior intelligent 
 Fresh like your breath after peppermint 
 Heaven sent these emcees to ease the pains 
 Until all of y'all feel like rap isn't the same in game 
 (Verse 2: Kimani Rodgers) 
 I master the arts, ripping heads apart 
 Literally, strip you of accessories and luxuries 
 How real it could be, it's what your introduced to 
 And separated youth never wanted to relate it to 
 The ones who produced you, dude 
 Long gone, erased all evidence of even once 
 Thinking you was a Don Juan 
 Far from what you want is where you stand at 
 And taken off the high pedestal 
 What they want is where your rhymes at 
 Promotion is what determines your fate 
 And you know what's ill? 
 When it's promoted right, wack kids learning the hate 
 Not talking the science behind it 
 Enables it to sneak up and surprise us 
 Football coaches having to scan and advise us at any given time 
 And still not influence your shit 
 It's what everybody want in one given rhyme 
 Keep a separated mind in these times 
 Or remain ignorant waiting for the sun to surface and be shine 
 It goes hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Say hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Say Hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Say Hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Say Hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Verse 3: Mr. Ricter 
 What if I took hell's concept and combined it 
 With Southern dialect, would it be too complex 
 For minds to master, ten years after 
 Kids like damn he flipped names 
 2009 they still lame, confused, scatterbrained 
 Rappers talking nonsensical syntax 
 Maybe slice open they back and snip wires 
 Replace blood with gasoline and set fire 
 Bugged out, even my tongue gets slugged out 
 Projectile thrower, morons excel slower 
 Proceeded by a Nazi, you Godly? Don't think so 
 (Verse 4: L-Fudge) 
 Yo, yo, I pull up on police when I'm in hot pursuit of my dreams 
 License and registration, representation come from Queens 
 I grab the might be like tonight it's only right, 
 The only right to remain silent, but I got a violent brain 
 But I restrain from crime, cause every rhyme is closer 
 I'm too nice to murder and vice versa 
 Enhance substantial sing-a-longs and time to curse the 
 You could think of the worst thing to say 
 But what's worse is that you're this half definition of the word rap 
 You busting mad shots and here's your bullets back 
 Ay, yo, observe the radio with mines close to snow 
 It's hard for me to maintain the prophesying in my flow 
 (Verse 5: Ceph Titled) 
 We interrupt this scheduled broadcast 
 To bring you the latest from 
 Celph Titled live and direct, the Floridian architect 
 8-1-3 residency got you on the safety precaution tip 
 Placing grenades in backpacks, making sure the pin 
 Get lost quick (What?) emcees is simple minded 
 Finally righting rhymes in crayons 
 You want to talk to that kid I battled? All right, let's have a s√©ance 
 Ripped your favorite idol to shreds like chemotherapy red heads 
 You got a lot at stake? I'll spare ribs and break legs instead 
 Spitting grammar so any worser place get spray with gamma rays 
 Energy, I'm invisible, got me rocking shoes at funerals 
 I'm steaming out my nostrils, leading headphone apostles 
 Believe me when you see these five emcees rip mics colossal 
 El tremendo Cubano gleaming in the moonlight 
 One half of Equilibrium, one love to all my aolites 
 It goes hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Say hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Say Hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Say Hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Say Hip-hop, hip-hop forever 
 Hip-hop, hip-hop forever
