 Unhappy relationships led to an ultimatum, my voice was serious these were the words that I gave her 
 Grew up with an intention that you could be with me forever 
 I'm sick of this girl, She was like "Yeah whatever!" 
 Oh word, then you with you I get jocked with all the women 
 You know there's other fish in the sea I'm going swimming 
 And I'm living in a world where love is fairly new to me 
 You grew up with mad goods which leads to opportunity 
 Which reminds me, never stood behind, now I'm making records so you can kiss my heinie (muah) 
 Women blind me, seem to find me take up all my time when I should be rhyming 
 Some things I do not understand (Nah) 
 Why am I such an emotional man (What) 
 Grey Goose down fast as I can, I'm stranded confused, damn 
 I can't understand the concept of commitment 
 Mood swings, and bullshit, females always dissing 
 You talk about I'm too damn serious? 
 It's ain't my fault I'm not some silly whore who's always acting curious 
 Make your mind up, you want me or not 
 If so we can do this or else your forgot 
 Just another stuck up female can't realize what you got 
 Lately I'm not a player I just cry a lot 
 And I gotta get over this weakness, this weedness 
 Females get too close and I seem to get speechless (Uh) 
 Sayin' stuff under my breath, I didn't like you anyways so go ahead with yourself 
 Actin' like you like me, you just like who I am 
 Wanna tell all your girls about your new fine man 
 Never been with an MC with it out, too bad shorty you ain't my type 
 When opportunity knocks I hope you open up the door so you can 
 Do that, do that, do that that that 
 The benefits of takin' chances may increase your finances when you 
 Do that, do that, do that that that 
 And if you with a shorty suggestin that you should spend the night you better 
 Do that, do that, do that that that 
 It's the actions that we formulate from day to day enable us to 
 Do that, do that, do that that that

 I got call from Polygram loungin at the pay-phone on 15th 
 Insisting that I should play the part of A&R / Artist 
 Yo money, I need the pending rights and the darkest ink 
 So I can sign this contract change my life from rags to luxury 
 In just one blink, rotate myself 180 
 Surprised by this fine lady on her knees, no it's not what you think 
 She's proposing to me 
 Took the ring made sure it fit my circumference 
 And since I won the lottery man, we draggin empty moet cans 
 From Tampa, Florida to the outskirts of the Andromeda 
 I'll pack enough heat to blow the mercury out the thermometer 
 You'll say he CAN'T do that, I'll put my foot down in weightless arguments 
 And find myself inside some clitoris 
 I got these bitches wide open, like I'm Deuce Angles, kid 
 If I was you I'd be best friends with me so you have a chance to live 
 You bought my CD now you wanna battle me all nervous 
 I'll serve you niggas 24/7 now that's customer service 
 Right down to the anatomical molecules 
 I'm the type to beat your ass and send mail-bombs to you at the hospital 
 I stay strapped with Pandora's box-cutter and a dead leprechaun 
 So if you feelin' lucky I'll unleash the upper echelon 
 Went to the courthouse but the judge didn't believe me 
 Stuck the bailiff with a syringe and then he started getting sleepy 
 Everyone got crazy shook and the jury started panicking 
 So I grabbed the gat from the bailiff and they got stiffer than a manikin 
 Now I'm the last man standing, receiving standing ovation 
 My revelations stand while giving out standing citations (That's my word) 
 My frequency, frequently off the hinges 
 Signin autographs now, oh wait my license is off suspension (No doubt) 
 Blessed with the skill of mind-readers takin' psychic action 
 Bought a 900 now I'm takin' former contraptions 
 In a stereo what you tryin' to adjust me for? 
 I know I'm fly jumpin' out the sky without a bungie cord
