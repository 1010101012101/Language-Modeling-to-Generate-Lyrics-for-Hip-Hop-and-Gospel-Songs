(Intro: Esoteric) 
 Yo, yo, It's the E.S. 
 Brought a couple of cats with me 
 Shit's about to get sticky 
 Yo, yo 
 (Verse 1: Esoteric) 
 I used to think drinking was a real disgrace 
 Now I drink till I can't feel my face 
 Drink till I can't feel the bass 
 Up in Magic Mike's truck 
 Till I'm like what, till my eyes shut 
 See me in the S class with a fly slut 
 While I see your ass with a messenger bag 
 Locking your bike up 
 I strike up a conversation with the heroine 
 And shoot myself in the foot like using heroin 
 Fucking with the three of us, you could never win 
 Cause that was back then, now I stack yen 
 Date Asian chicks only to attract ends 
 Cause every white chick I date likes my black friends 
 When I'm 65, I'm a have a black Benz 
 Bald, with a monocle, with a black lens 
 Buy mad art and take a part in wack trends 
 In a midlife crisis with cash to spend 
 (Chorus: Esoteric) 
 Cats don't even want it with my crew 
 Don't want this to escalate to something 
 That they just is, just cause 
 There's just no fucking with these 
 Devastating emcees 
 (We devastating) 
 And since you don't seem to understand 
 You can ask your man 
 He can tell you all about the mics that we rip 
 When we're living as these 
 Devastating emcees 
 (We devastating) 
 (Verse 2: Celph Titled) 
 I spark fights with the mic 
 And leave the pop screen in shambles 
 Fuck your mother doggy style 
 While I be gripping on her love handles 
 I use a sample and make it unrecognizable 
 My squad could fire you 
 With the mac 11 ignitable 
 Piss on a bible while you pray to your God 
 I do a tour in Shalamon, get infinite head nods 
 My insignia resembles that of rockets being launched 
 Record the sound of your head exploding 
 And put it in a song 
 Dead you on a remix, making beats in the graveyard 
 We off the hook, the map, the meat rack and the fucking radar 
 Stuck up hoes, how many times I gotta tell you, right 
 I'd rather fuck a fat bitch with big titties and cellulite 
 Niggas is shook, coming at me trying to act hard 
 When I know you watch Star Trek in a Captain Picard leotard 
 Numb you quick, smash your head into a juke box 
 Which in effect, will put you in a studio with Big and 'Pac 
 I'm no joke like Arsenio Hall stand up 
 In a title bout, I'll still knock you out, even in handcuffs 
 This is the lingo for the next level niggas 
 Who put hand grenades in teddy bears 
 And give 'em out at Christmas 
 With precise accuracy, destroy anatomies 
 I'm that nigga that gave that mother fucking apple 
 To Adam and Eve 
 Y'all ain't ready for the return of the hog shit 
 Esoteric, Apathy and Celph Titled with the rawness 
 (Chorus: Esoteric) 
 Cats don't even want it with my crew 
 Don't want this to escalate to something 
 That they just is, just cause 
 There's just no fucking with these 
 Devastating emcees 
 (We devastating) 
 And since you don't seem to understand 
 You can ask your man 
 He can tell you all about the mics that we rip 
 When we're living as these 
 Devastating emcees 
 (We devastating) 
 (Verse 3: Apathy) 
 Now that the Gods are older 
 Roll with whole squads of soldiers 
 And an entourage of broads 
 To massage our shoulders 
 I only keep hoes to fold clothes and laundry 
 Feed me and fan me with leaves from a palm tree 
 Sitting on a chrome like I'm Caesar in Rome 
 They point my joints in they whips 
 So they speakers are blown 
 When I speak, better let it seep deep in your dome 
 I'm like God, turning blasphemous people to stone 
 Since the first chromosomes created in sea foam 
 I dragged my human bones to a plush beach home 
 When the serpent tried to trick me into copping his fruit 
 I slipped the shit in Eve's drink and started knocking her boots 
 I'm like God, fuck Mother Earth, started breaking atoms 
 Sexually you're weak, your freaks faking orgasms 
 I'm electromagnetically charged 
 Till bolts of lightning explode through the 
 Tips of my big pens when I'm writing 
 The fire starter, my esophagus burns phosphorous 
 Soft carcass encased in sarcophagus to burst in flames 
 Thugs got to reverse their range 
 'Cause when my verse is in range, the words hurts their brains 
 Experts convert the verses into virtual shots 
 You feel the force like paratroopers in vertical drops 
 The Demigodz like the firing squad with teks shooting 
 Three clips to remix this public execution 
 (Chorus: Esoteric)
