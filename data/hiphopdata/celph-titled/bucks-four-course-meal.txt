"It's nineteen ninety now and there's certain individuals 
 Swear they rollin' hard and get robbed on principle" - Mos Def 'Got' 
 October 26th 
 [Celph Titled talking]: 
 It's nineteen ninety NOW. Now motherfuckers! 
 [Verse One]{over Buckwild's beat for The Artifacts 'C'mon With The Get Down (Remix)': 
 So here I am (yeah) 
 In the spot you probably wish you was 
 It's a few haters, but damn if I ain't gettin' love 
 You see my fan base (yep) 
 You see them quotin' bars 
 You see them bringin' up my name sayin', "He goin' hard" 
 He took some time to make an album 
 Now he's back in effect and motherfuckers wanna out him 
 A lot of rappers got my face on they dart board 
 But they don't start war 'cause I'm the hardest of the hardcore 
 Tinman don't need foil (no) 
 Metallic, exo-skeleton when heat boils 
 Leave you in the sun till your meat spoils 
 The beat boils 
 Buckwild bakes the heat rocks 
 While you soft though, I'm pullin' back the crossbow 
 (And y'all know) 
 The game's saturated and crowded 
 But you don't hear us bitchin', instead we did somethin' about it 
 Made an album with the same ingredients as many classics known 
 The golden era rap fans who love echoing saxophones 
 [Verse Two] {over Buckwild's beat for Bushwackas's beat for 'Caught Up In The Game'} 
 A concept first of it's kind 
 Imagine if we combine (humm) 
 Me, with the murderous rhymes and tracks from a earlier time
