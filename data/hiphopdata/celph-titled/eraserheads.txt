"Here it come, come." 
 "Here it come, come." 
 (Scratch Chorus) 
 "Stay dope boy, on guard, real sharp 
 Write rhymes that's real hard" - Gemini The Gifted One 
 [Verse One] [Celph Titled]: 
 The sound of my voice will make stab wounds 
 Father of the Universe leaving planets with half moons 
 I have assumed that those who choose to make rap music have no talent at music 
 So me and Vinnie came to grab your head and put a gat to it 
 [Vinnie Paz]: 
 I bring the.45 Glock and the .38 
 AR-15 send their body to the pearly gates 
 Me and Celph ain't making happy music, this is truly hate 
 Toby Hooper in this motherfucker cousin, saw his face 
 [Celph Titled]: 
 And when we're holding the Tec we'll put a hole in your neck 
 Equipping you with a permanent T-Pain vocal effect 
 I ain't a flossy dude sipping Mo' 
 But if I was I'd pop that cork off in your bitch's asshole (Let 'em know) 
 [Vinnie Paz]: 
 That's how that ho get treated, she get the smut treatment 
 Toss her out the whip, leave her on the rough cement 
 Celph and Vinnie will deliver an abrupt beating 
 And the Walther 9M will leave your guts leaking 
 [Celph Titled]: 
 Your video had the best special effects I seen 
 Had you in the projects using computer blue screens (Know what I mean?) 
 [Vinnie Paz]: 
 You phony motherfuckers never held a ratchet ever 
 You was in the faggot bar with Kanye strapped in leather 
 (Scratch Chorus) 
 "Gat goes boom boom boom, gat goes boom boom" - Q-Tip 
 "Pow pow, buck buck, pow buck" - Ice Cube 
 "Bang bang bang, just like the ricochet rabbit" 
 "For my arrival, rappers are teamin' up" 
 "Gat goes boom boom boom, gat goes boom boom" - Q-Tip 
 "Pow pow, buck buck, pow buck" - Ice Cube 
 "Yo I'm strapped with the gat, step up, buck buck" - Party Arty 
 "You can suck my dick you little fuckin' bitch, so blucka blucka bloaw" - Vinnie Paz 
 [Verse 2] [Celph Titled]: 
 I never thought I'd get a bitch pregnant ever 
 Until my main squeeze gave birth to a baby Beretta 
 (The more gravy the better) don't holler just yell 
 It's like the night before Christmas, I can't wait to see Hell 
 [Vinnie Paz]: 
 I can't wait to see Hell either 
 I'm a run up on the first motherfucker that I see with a rusty cleaver 
 I ain't a sucker neither and no one fuck with Vinnie 
 Fat gut, wife-beater, pasta, I'm a fucking ginney 
 [Celph Titled]: 
 I'll smash a mirror, I'll walk under a ladder 
 I'll let a black cat cross my path, it don't matter 
 'Cause I ain't superstitious and I don't fear nothing 
 You're talking all that tough shit 
 [Vinnie Paz]: 
 But you's a queer frontin' 
 And y'all are snitch but let me tell you something, you ain't hear nothin' 
 I like to refer to my trigger as the fear button 
 I don't fear nothing either, I just cock the pistol 
 I like the way the bullet burst and what it do to tissue 
 (Scratch Chorus)

 [Verse 3] [Celph Titled]: 
 Yo we blazing son like gang bangers with laser guns 
 My rap verses are curses and scriptures spit with a razor tongue 
 Nitwit I play ancient drums 
 To conjure up demon spirits that appear in smoke out of a pagan's lungs 
 I'm everything: hardcore, complex, original 
 You don't wanna test the disciple of death 
 C-Titled is dressed like salmon at Red Lobster 
 And C-Titled's the best at blamming hammers at impostors 
 Get your ass whooped with automatic hazard causers 
 You can't make tables turn, you got bad revolvers 
 Faulty guns that go [click] when you pull the trigger 
 Mine's go [blick blick], it's sick when I pull the trigger 
 [Vinnie Paz]: 
 It don't matter how we get down, guns around 
 I'm writtin' [?] 
 I got a way with wild shit cousin, tons of crimes 
 Tons of forty-fives, AKs, tons of knives 
 (Scratch Chorus)
