She say she wanna get up on that rapper shit 
 Popping bottles stuffing money under mattresses 
 She been on that tour bus since I picked her up at Hammersmith 
 Her arse so round I thought it had to be a camera trick 
 Eh, where you going in them Izzy Marants? 
 Hop on a plane come and chill with me and Dizzee in France 
 Hop on a train you can come to any city you want 
 I got the fame you could be on Nicole Bitchie tomorrow 
 Couldn't never love a lippy yat 
 But she got me acting like a pussy for that kitty cat 
 Reverse cow girl, reverse piggy back 
 I thought you said your arse was mine, come and gimme that! 
 Witch doctor woman [x8] 
 She said she wanna get in on that rapper shit 
 She wanna polish the awards up in my cabinet 
 She a ten, she defy the law of averages 
 Thought she Catholic but that Rihanna tat in Arabic 
 Where you going in that pretty Givenchi Dress 
 I'll intro you to Westwood buy you Vivienne's garms 
 The alcohol that she ingests just hope her liver ain't harmed 
 I bring her flowers but she says she want a stickier plant 
 From trips on a bus now she's on a trip and a buzz 
 When lighting strikes wonder if God is taking pictures of us 
 We finally made it on our own through all the hicks and the cups 
 Maybe some magic came and cured this fucking sickness in us 
 Keep it running 
 From not giving a fuck 
 Now she's in her giving a fuck 
 I made her feel like Lewis Hamilton was picking her up 
 Don't even mind the other groupies and the strippers and stuff 
 No time to waste might as well face it you're addicted to love 
 'Cause I am sick 
 What you prescribing 
 Give me a fix 
 Sip on a cocktail of lots of shit we shouldn't mix 
 Yeah
