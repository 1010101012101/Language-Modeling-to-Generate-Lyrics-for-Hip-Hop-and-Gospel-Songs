 Yeah, yeah 
 They may not play this on the radio 
 So I'm gonna make them sure 
 This is the realest shit I ever wrote (that I ever wrote) 
 So hear my spirit grow 
 Grow free in myself 
 Feel my humanity 
 Kill this, it's a felony 
 I'll make sure you remember me 
 I'll make sure you remember 
 (Tinie Tempah:) 
 Uh, climbin' high to a brand new grounds 
 Got a new crib and you can't come round 
 This year, haters gonna pick me up 
 This year, no one's gonna hold me down 
 Yeah, I'm the shit, yo, word to my bowels 
 I wear snapbacks, y'all wear crowns 
 Crisis rich if I wasn't this big 
 Crisis big if I wasn't this proud 
 Yeah, 8 year sittin' on top 
 Yeah, I been there, done that, had that what 
 'Fore I did rap, had two, two jobs 
 Hip-hop, grime and then I went pop 
 Trade your life for my life, let's swap 
 Go clean in my dad's old shop with a mop 
 Where man knew if I wasn't gettin' money on the ends 
 I used to wear Lyle and scott 
 Used to love hoes, now I want bae 
 Used to want dough, now I want change 
 Used to be wilder, now I'm more tame 
 Used to be crazy, now I'm insane 
 Yeah, I'm insane, yeah 
 Talkin' to the mirror like, "How did I get this fame?" 
 TBT '07 and 8

 Yeah, uh, I think she in love with a married man 
 I fell in love with a married chick 
 Sometimes I run to a random place 
 Sometimes I'm scared of not havin' shit 
 Sometimes I fear I might lose it all 
 It's such a crazy world, law of averages 
 I don't know how Drizzy manages 
 I don't know how he manages 
 Nearly fell apart in the first year 
 Didn't think that I could handle it 
 Rude time, climb, grab a pit 
 We smellin' like we sellin' cannabis 
 Who in the fuck do they think they are? 
 Hope they don't think I'm just any guy 
 Hope they don't think I'ma let it slide 
 I got every single line memorised 
 Love letters to the city, city, city 
 Love letters to my city 
 Thank you for fuckin' with me 
 I know the mayor, I know the nitties 
 Lost some papers but I gained the masses 
 Wrote my world before I made a classic 
 Take a pill and let 'em chase the magic 
 Fuck whoever tryna hate on Patrick

 We bring the stars out 
 We bring the whole Geordie Shore cast out 
 Got a mandem, but it's all wild 
 Been drivin' round, we fast now 
 I ain't even tryna gloat 
 We only that boy skiin' on slopes 
 Where there is only roach 
 This the realest shit I ever wrote, uh
