Fasten your seatbelt 
 If you're on board 
 Fasten your seatbelt 
 If you're on board 
 Fasten your seatbelt 
 If you're on board 
 Fasten your seatbelt 
 If you're on board 
 Oh we got us 5 minutes till we go go 
 Oh we got us 5 minutes till we go go 
 Oh we got us 5 minutes till we go go 
 Hello world, let's go! 
 Uh 
 Wake in the morning 
 And I smell my breath 
 Send a picture to my niggas of my girl in bed 
 I can diggety-bop with diggetty-Puff and Pharrell and Nep 
 On the chimney tops 
 With a pistol with a wowser dress 
 I said thanks 
 But I haven't heard you're welcome yet 
 So fuck everybody yo 
 We got the world ahead 
 Black chicks 
 White chicks 
 Purple dress 
 And my head screwed on 
 Call it permanent 
 Excuse my Portuguese, that's German, French 
 That's German friend 
 But I fuck with BBC like Fearne and Reg 
 Bought a pair of Jordan 3s with a firm cement 
 Slagging on a hundred damn trillion percent 
 Even in my skinny jeans I still walk like this 
 And 007 make me talk like this 
 Pedal to the medal, tell Jeremy Clarkson 
 You seen anybody my age diving a Porsche like this! 
 I've been ready from the get-go 
 You better keep your mouth open 
 If your legs closed 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 Bloody crazy roast on Sunday 
 Got mash-up on Monday 
 Real twisted on Tuesday 
 Woke up wasted on Wednesday 
 Got completely trashed on Thursday 
 Got fucked up on Friday 
 Bad money from Saturday 
 Tick, Tick, Tick, Boom 
 I threw my baby out the pram, and her toys as well 
 I got adults acting like a bunch of boys and girls 
 She asked me why I never let a woman try on my shades 
 Don't want her fucking hair on my tortoise shells 
 For my festivals, I can sense some awesome wealth 
 I get the citizens cane like Orson Welles 
 My number even had to change cause some annoying girl 
 Was like fucking Babestation on my voicemail 
 No matter how much you flush the toilet, ill 
 We're the motherfucking shit, you can't avoid the smell 
 All these swagger-jackers getting me annoyed as hell 
 You ain't never seen talent on The Voice as well! 
 London Fashion Week made me walk like this 
 And Stephen Fry made me want to talk like this 
 Finger on the button, tell whoever's in charge 
 Che Guevara made me want to break the law like this! 
 I've been ready from the get-go 
 You better keep your mouth open 
 And your legs closed 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 Fasten your seatbelt 
 If you're on board 
 Fasten your seatbelt 
 If you're on board 
 Oh we got us 5 minutes till we go go 
 Oh we got us 5 minutes till we go go 
 Oh we got us 5 minutes till we go go 
 Tick, tick, tick, boom! 
 Wake up in the morning and I smell my breath 
 I could have had to be going to work instead 
 Fuck a silly contract, I return the cheque 
 When you was trying to make money, did you earn respect? 
 I seen your pussy game made me walk like this 
 And Star Wars made me use the force like this 
 When you're fucking busy having dinner with stars 
 You better start eating with your knife and fork like this! 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 5 minutes till I explode 
 Tick, Tick, Tick, Tick, BOOM! 
 To you fellas!
