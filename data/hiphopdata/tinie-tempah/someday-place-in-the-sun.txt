They never have time to give you 
 They're always on the run 
 But you keep on working for your place in the sun 
 When the lights go out in London 
 Your work has just begun 
 Someday you will find your place in the sun 
 Find our place in the sun 
 Find our place in the sun 
 Back to the beginning in fact no we're winning 
 Thanks to the spectacular raps that I'm scribbling 
 It's 'Bac's' that I'm driven in 
 Plaques in my living room 
 The stats match the facts man I'm back, back, back, back 
 Mama look we made it out the flats we was living in 
 Times I nearly thought I would collapse living in Britain 
 Smiling in pictures 
 Flying to fixtures 
 Never in denial 'cause the Nile is a river 
 Rappers on the sly try'na eye my elixir 
 Jealousy's a crime bet your pride won't resist 'ya 
 To get to where I am I cried like I was injured 
 Bled like a soldier perspired like a sprinter 
 Brother said T keep an eye out from them rinsers 
 People that you hang with are trying to lynch ya 
 Never break down 
 I'll be there to lift ya 
 You're perfect how you are so why they trying to fix ya 
 They never have time to give you 
 They're always on the run 
 But you keep on working for your place in the sun 
 When the lights go out in London 
 Your work has just begun 
 Someday you will find your place in the sun 
 Away from the pain and the sadness 
 Soon the whole world is gonna understand my language 
 Everybody's try'na find a method to the madness 
 Wankers hating on me 'cause I did it single handed 
 Whatever will be will be even if you plan it 
 On the road to success but feeling like I'm stranded 
 Disturbing London ho I don't speak no other language 
 Started with a goal and then I ended with a hat-trick 
 Selling out arenas think it's time to do a new tour 
 Pennies for the thoughts that I'm about to give you food for 
 Never show emotion even on a mood board 
 Sold my bandwagon then I went and bought a two door 
 Dizzee made me rap and rider made me get my groove on 
 I just wanna hit a billion views and do a tune Sean 
 Thinking 'bout life listening to too short 
 One day they'll have a statue of me in Madame Tussauds 
 They never have time to give you 
 They're always on the run 
 But you keep on working for your place in the sun 
 When the lights go out in London 
 Your work has just begun 
 Someday you will find your place in the sun 
 For that spot I'ma use Cruella Deville power 
 Or do a Willow and Jaden and use my Will power 
 Victory is the sweetest defeat is real sour 
 Together we can move mountains rebuild towers 
 A lot of hurt still waiting for God to heal ours 
 Stand up and rebel again the real cowards 
 They never have time to give you 
 They're always on the run (on the run) 
 But you keep on working for your place in the sun 
 When the lights go out in London (Disturbing London) 
 Your work has just begun (We've just begun) 
 Someday you will find your place in the sun
