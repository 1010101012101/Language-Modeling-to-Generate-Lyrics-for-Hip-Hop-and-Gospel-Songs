(Gator Creek) 
 Looking in the barrel of a 12 gauge magnum 
 Who's that standing behind the trigger finger squinting at me 
 Looking down the barrel of a 12 gauge magnum 
 I ain't never done nobody no wrong but me 
 (Tinie Tempah) 
 Stolen from the wild and released into captivity 
 So when I'm near the public to long I act fidgety 
 Act liberties have to take my gat to Liberty 
 To stop that crazy bitch tryna snap my black dick off me 
 Conceived 'cause no one used the condom or the pill 
 But was welcomed with open arms like the statue that's in Brazil 
 Mummy knew I'd be expensive so she nearly called me Bill 
 Daddy thought that the stress would kill him so he nearly called me Will 
 Weighing in at 7 pounds and 1 ounce this little miracle 
 Got given a name with way too many syllables 
 That made my registration in class a tad difficult 
 And anyone who did telesales a little miserable 
 Where my dark skin girls at and aboriginals 
 Where my light skinned girls at? The whole of Liverpool 
 All I ever wanted to do was be individual 
 Says that black rapper on your stereo ha typical

 (Tinie Tempah) 
 Looking at a MILF, thinking bout filth 
 Make that fuckin' O'Neil, then I give her the Shaquille 
 I got all the top lawyers looking at my deals 
 One UK tour we probably looking 'bout a mill 
 Rocking my fur knowing something got killed 
 I even gave PETA dough to help me deal with the guilt 
 Might take Jameela Jamil for a meal 
 But I still eat fried chicken and I still drink Lilt 
 (For that totally tropical taste) 
 Life on the edge 
 Life on the ledge 
 Life through the lens 
 Life on the net 
 Life in the press where there's a life there's a death 
 Sometimes I literally hear God reply to my prayers 
 If life is a bitch then life is my ex 
 Who was so overly obsessed by the size of my head 
 Told me I broke her heart then put a knife to my chest 
 Now it's real cold on the other side of the bed 
 Threw me in at the deep end despite of my fears 
 These journalists can be fuckin' lions tigers and bears 
 Vincent van Gogh'd em, gave 'em a work of art 
 Now these critics all make me wanna fuckin' slice off my ears 
 Fight club yeah 
 Bought me a pair of Airs 
 My niggas told me well done 'cause them mediums is rare 
 Yeah looking down the barrel 
 Shoot but don't let it stain my American Apparel
