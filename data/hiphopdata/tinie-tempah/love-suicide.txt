Our love suicide 
 Our love suicide 
 Our love suicide... 
 Tinie Tempah: 
 Ah, love suicide is killing me 
 You're getting into my head like a guillotine 
 You've got me grasping for air in your vicinity 
 And now you're saying some things 
 That you don't really mean, that's really mean 
 How the hell am I caught up between? 
 Devil's advocate, trying not to intervene 
 Putting up a fight like it ain't a thing to me! 
 I swear it's gotta be the worst position to be in, be in 
 I guess you felt you've been ignored 
 And your perfect picture turned into a jigsaw 
 'Cause when you're round me you get a little withdrawn 
 And we just can't seem to find time to sit and talk 
 I know she is in shock! 
 Ah, what happens when the hourglass of love runs out? 
 Under one roof and one house 
 And everything becomes so cold 
 Baby, that's the only thing I wanna know! 
 Tell me the reason why 
 You commit a love suicide 
 Think you want our love to die 
 You did it on purpose 
 I'm all out of tears 
 Time to get outta here 
 You made it very clear 
 You did it on purpose 
 Our love suicide 
 Our love suicide 
 Our love suicide 
 Tinie Tempah: 
 I feel like I'm about to break down 
 Why you're acting like kid up in the playground? 
 If you got something on your mind, why don't you let it out? 
 So the end of us is coming any day now, any day! 
 I thought we'd never separate 
 I could be destroyed but not defeated on the 
 You know is probably for the best, anyway 
 Cause my suspicious mind was wary of your jealous face 
 Let's go our separate ways 
 What happens when the hourglass of love runs out? 
 Under one roof and one house 
 And everything becomes so cold 
 Baby, that's the only thing I wanna know! 
 Tell me the reason why 
 You committed a love suicide 
 Think you want our love to die 
 You did it on purpose 
 I'm all out of tears 
 Time to get outta here 
 You made it very clear 
 You did it on purpose, purpose 
 Our love suicide 
 Our love suicide 
 Our love suicide 
 Why would you hurt us? 
 Our love suicide 
 Our love suicide 
 Our love suicide 
 Ester Dean: 
 Does it make you happy to see me down? 
 Does it make your day to see me drown? 
 I guess I'm your entertainment 
 You don't know what you wasted 
 But soon you will see! 
 What happens when the hourglass of love runs out? 
 Within four walls of one house 
 And everything becomes so cold 
 Baby, that's the only thing I wanna know! 
 Tell me the reason why (Why, why) 
 You committed a love suicide (Uh) 
 I think you want our love to die 
 You did it on purpose! (No!) 
 I'm all out of tears (I'm all out of tears) 
 Time to get outta here 
 You made it very clear (Uh) 
 You did it on purpose, purpose! (Suicide, love suicide) 
 You did it on purpose, purpose! (Suicide, love suicide) 
 You made me feel worthless, worthless (Suicide, love suicide) 
 Why would you hurt us, hurt us! 
 You did it on purpose, purpose! (You did it on purpose, suicide, love suicide) 
 You did it on purpose, purpose! (Suicide, love suicide) 
 You made me feel worthless, worthless (You made me feel worthless, suicide, love suicide) 
 Why would you hurt us, hurt us! 
 What happens when the hourglass of love runs out? 
 Under one roof and one house 
 And everything becomes so cold!
