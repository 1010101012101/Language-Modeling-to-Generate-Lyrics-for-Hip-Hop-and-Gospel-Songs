 Girl I've been unfaithful baby don't you say 
 It's OK 
 Did some things behind you baby don't you say 
 It's OK 
 Why don't you cry now, why don't you cry now? 
 'Cause then I know you still feel something for me 
 But I truly know it's over when I hear you say 
 It's OK 
 You told me you were down for whatever 
 I thought you'd be around me forever 
 You were my New York girl with some LA 
 Ambition and a really good Christian 
 You knocked me down like a featherweight 
 Try'na fuck around with a heavyweight 
 How the hell could you say in the middle of the night 
 That we should call it a day? 
 I'd rather fucking do a bit of prison time 
 You had a key to every single thing of mine 
 My house my car my motherfucking heart 
 I guess we didn't agree to the same deal 
 I guess that she was tired of the same spiel 
 Now I'm in the meat packing dialing 911 
 Try'na tell 'em how this pain feels 
 So run away, run along 
 Thought we were fate but we were wrong 
 We were wrong 
 'Cause when men lie their women cry but she won't 
 I can't breathe, I won't cope 
 I need a drink, I wanna smoke 
 'Cause I'm the cigarette butt of my own jokes 
 Hands held high and my back against the ropes 
 If blood is thicker than water, we were thicker than blood 
 Now I'm feeling for something I can't touch 
 Feeling guilty whilst you be up in the club 
 Shit I been caught so who am I to judge 
 Try'na regain my composure 
 I guess this is the end of the road huh 
 And after 25 times of hearing 
 Please leave a message after the tone 
 I know

 Girl I've been unfaithful baby don't you say 
 It's OK 
 Did some things behind you baby don't you say 
 It's OK 
 Why don't you cry now, why don't you cry now? 
 'Cause then I know you still feel something for me 
 But I truly know it's over when I hear you say 
 It's OK 
 You put your nail on the coffin had a finger on the trigger 
 Said she ever going down she taking everything with her 
 Took something so good and made it redder than the colour 
 On the bottom of her slippers 
 And not a word from your mother yet 
 Even though I made you suffer like a suffragette 
 Fucking busy I was busy fucking round another woman 
 Undercover like a Brian Ferry album 
 So run away, run along 
 From the people and places where you belong 
 Just imagine the gossip in the salon 
 Make me feel dumb for fooling round with them blondes 
 But love heals all things gradually 
 This is something out a Shakespeare tragedy 
 And even though we ain't happily ever after 
 I just hope you're living after happily

 Girl I've been unfaithful baby don't you say 
 It's OK (Let it all out let the tears fall down) 
 Did some things behind you baby don't you say 
 It's OK (Any minute expecting for you to walk now) 
 Why don't you cry now, why don't you cry now? 
 'Cause then I know you still feel something for me 
 But I truly know it's over when I hear you say 
 It's OK
