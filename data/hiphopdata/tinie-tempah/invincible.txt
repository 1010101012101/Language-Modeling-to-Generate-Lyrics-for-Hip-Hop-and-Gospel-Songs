 Yeah ah they said we shouldn't, Yeah they said we wouldn't 
 Ah look where we are, We've done what they thought we couldn't 
 As bad as the odds were looking, Push yeah, we kept on pushing 
 And every time I nearly hit the ground, You were my cushion 
 There's evidence that proves, That you were heaven sent 
 'Cause when I needed rescuin', You were there at my defence 
 Girl in you I find a friend, You make me feel alive again 
 And I feel like the brightest star, cause you make me shine again

 We don't need no shields, Love is the armour that we need 
 We're invincible, Invincible

 Ah from the wildest water, Yeah to the highest mountains 
 Ah you and I forever, Even through the driest deserts 
 You lift me higher than ever, I feel as light as a feather 
 And when we're fightin' together, We can take on the weather 
 I will keep you warm through, Every single storm you 
 Ever have to walk through, I will go before you 
 I will be the voice when you, Need someone to talk to 
 Please don't ever doubt me, Let me reassure you
