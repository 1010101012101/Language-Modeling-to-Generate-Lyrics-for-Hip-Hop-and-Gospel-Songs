You're only a man 
 It's only right you let the tears fall 
 Know your strong but you can't take it all 
 You just lost one 
 You're just a man 
 Don't be scared to let the angels fly 
 Just let go 'cause it's your time to cry 
 You just lost one 
 You just lost one 
 Said that we would never break 
 Said that we never falter 
 I thought that we were doing great 
 I thought we'd make it to the altar 
 Love the critical acclaim 
 I knew that it'd would catapult ya 
 Hands on the table where the pepper and the salt are 
 Only thing missing rocks bigger than Gibraltar hey 
 Said that if it didn't kill me 
 Then it would only make us stronger 
 But in our final hour will we 
 Be wishing we could stay for longer 
 Maybe it would make us somber 
 Wanna live and die another day 
 You better change your name to Pascal Payet 
 You'll always be the one that got away 
 And I'm over you and you over me 
 And you overdue and I'm over seas 
 'Cause I called you names and you phoned police 
 Said man are all the same like there's loads of me 
 We arguing along Dover street 
 At least try and smile in these photos please 
 And now you're all alone cup of Ovaltine 
 Whilst I'm with the one who I'm s'posed to be 
 Congratulations on the first 
 I wonder how we would have turned out 
 Some relationships fat people some of them never ever work out 
 I put the stars all around you 
 I never let you take your purse out 
 But when everybody turned up 
 Only one of us was turned down 
 And girl where you going with that attitude 
 We both feel the same and its natural 
 I ain't leaving 'cause I hate you 
 I'm leaving 'cause I have to 
 A half empty glass, two capsules 
 Guess I'll never ever know the exact truth 
 If you can hear me this is at you 
 I would have had her if she had you 
 How my s'posed to be majestic 
 How my s'posed to be mature 
 When I've been try'na move towards you from the moment I could crawl 
 I'll still catch you when you fall 
 And I'll still answer when you call 
 Guess we didn't understand the language 
 Of the writing on the wall 
 Missing posters up of my heart girl 
 With my love as a reward speeding switching Richards gears 
 Whilst I'm trying not to stall 
 Things will never be the same 
 My back's against the wall 'cause the looser puts the blame but the winner takes it all
