Here everyone's a hero 
 Yeah we all learn to fly away 
 No tears when the sun goes 
 'Cause heroes never die no way 
 Here everyone's a hero 
 We all got a second chance 
 And heaven plays piano 
 'Cause heroes love to dance 
 Victory is ours 
 Mystery and power 
 History is sour 
 The future smells sweet 
 Try'na get into heaven racing through hells streets 
 Dancing with the devil with my two left feet 
 Laughing with the rebels up on New Year's Eve 
 65432 
 As the devil in the red white and blue dress leaves 
 She says I'm a motherfucking c u n t 
 Say hello to everybody's favourite new MC 
 Loving the alphabet except these two NV 
 Some of these motherufckers getting too friendly 
 Why the fuck am I sitting next to two MP's 
 Bullshit and politics try'na find out where knowledge is 
 'Cause it ain't in a scholarship 
 Or these schools and colleges 
 Studied by psychologists 
 Quality in my qualities 
 Try'na disturb the whole wild world with no apologies 
 Here everyone's a hero 
 Yeah we all learn to fly away 
 No tears when the sun goes 
 'Cause heroes never die no way 
 Here everyone's a hero 
 We all got a second chance 
 And heaven plays piano 
 'Cause heroes love to dance 
 Fuck the fucking watershed and all the censors 
 'Cause I'll be going going gone from November 
 You ask me one more question bout our census 
 I'll go deed poll and loose my fucking tempah 
 Nobodies safe whilst I'm focused on my agenda 
 No race religion or gender 
 See these niggas get a sudden case of dementia 
 Them fashion bloggers gimme top marks for my spencer uh 
 Spencer heart expensive art 
 Won't take the tube send a car 
 Bad women Kendra Stars 
 Kickers from Ann summers and mad La senza bras 
 Heaven plays piano I'm try'na learn guitar 
 Are we any closer to God if we're the stars 
 Together we stand divided we fall apart 
 I Think it's time to show everyone who we are 
 Here everyone's a hero 
 Yeah we all learn to fly away 
 No tears when the sun goes 
 'Cause heroes never die no way 
 Here everyone's a hero 
 We all got a second chance 
 And heaven plays piano 
 'Cause heroes love to dance
