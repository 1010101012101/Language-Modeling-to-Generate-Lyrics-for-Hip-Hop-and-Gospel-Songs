Blah, Yeah, Simple 
 Honey, I'm a fine boy, no pimples 
 I've done deja-vu I've done dingles 
 And fuckin' everybody wants me on their single 
 My mom 44 years with no wrinkles 
 I got a hundred thousand on me I could sprinkle 
 All year my house covered in tinsel 
 I gone pop and I won't stop Pringles yeah 
 So involved in this moment, I can't let it go 
 Tik tok, check my Roley wrist watch 
 Fuck how much a drink cost, we about to kick off like 
 It's outrageous and so phisticated it's all in the air... 
 The big boss, make 'em jump like Kriss Kross

 I think I should remind em, 
 I'm about to clean up like a Dyson 
 'Cause I just say how it is like Simon 
 I like the taste of alcohol I got wine gums 
 I don't eva wanna hear another siren 
 Them highrises can block your horizon 
 Disturbing London is the city that I'm from 
 Where if we like the tune, we make the DJ rewind 'em yeah 
 So involved in this moment, I can't let it go 
 Tik tok, check my Roley wrist watch

 It's outrageous and so so phisticated it's all in the air...

 My fans are crazy with stencils and staples 
 I came to cause a bit of chaos and to break rules
