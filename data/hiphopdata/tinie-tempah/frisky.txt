I just can't stop the feelings, don't seem to go away. 
 So if I hurt your feelings, don't blame it all on me. 
 I just can't stop the feelings (nothing else to say), 
 And now they're here to stay. 
 So if I hurt your feelings (don't take it the wrong way), 
 It's just because I'm... 
 Oh la la la la, la la la la la 
 Oh la la la la, la la la frisky 
 Oh la la la la, la la la la la 
 Oh la la la la, la la la frisky 
 I think I found a winner, with no ring around her finger. 
 Her dress from all saints, but I think I've found a sinner. 
 I think her pals are with her with her, whos your girlfriend downin' liquor 
 If I tell her I'm a boxer, would she let me down her knickers... 
 I wanna pick her up, pin her down. 
 She gon be waking up my neighbors if I bring her round. 
 Where I'm from if you're famous you don't go to tinsel town. 
 Pose for a picture smile, the fashionista's out. 
 They say her best days, it cool to take her picture 
 Girl you better keep your distance I just wanna have eh eh 
 I'm on a mission I don't even wanna kiss her 
 Honey I won't even miss ya when I'm done with ya eh eh 
 I just can't stop the feelings, (nothing else to say) 
 Don't seem to go away.

 Oh la la la la, la la la frisky 
 Would you risk it for a chocolate biscuit? 
 Would you risk it for a chocolate biscuit? 
 Yeah, I'm suspicious, she looks delicious. 
 She likes to talk a lot that's why I call her Trisha. 
 Her nails are manicured her hair has been conditioned, 
 Don't worry 'bout her race she ain't in no competition, 
 She should be on television or on the radio singing, 
 I would be the first to watch and I would be the first to listen, 
 I would put her in positions like the mission from my staircase to 
 Her kitchen leave her twitchin, twitchin, twitchin, twitchin... 
 They say her best days, it cool to take her picture
