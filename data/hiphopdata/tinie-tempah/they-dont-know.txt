 Uh, when the cameras show up, we show up 
 And roll up and roll out 
 Let them think what they think, it's funny how 
 They didn't get it then, so they won't now 
 Yeah 'cause they don't know us 
 They can't say what they say 
 Don't give us thoughts 
 Don't need them anyway 
 (Tinie Tempah:) 
 Everywhere I go, I gotta pose 
 Sittin' on the throne with a 'fro 
 Chillin' with a prince at the BAFTA's 
 Gold all over the globe 
 Any time I stress, I can get it from a rasta 
 Headside, kill 'em when they know 
 Didn't want to know 
 Baby said, "Shh, you can hit it on the low" 
 You can hit it on the low, you can hit it on the low 
 Come in on your own, leave your knickers at the door 
 Yeah, I'm the AP, got the wonder tug-a-war 
 I don't holla anymore, tryna make a nigga poor 
 Tryna hit me with the drink, no no 
 They might think, they don't know 
 Let 'em talk ish, promo 
 'Cause we don't really care 'bout nothin'

 Young man comin' up from the corner 
 Nobody tryna set me if I wanna 
 Never have to worry 'bout if he give me the banana 
 Me haffi tell them na na na na na 
 Oh no no, slide in my DMs and my writs just froze 
 I'm too cold, don't wanna play 'cause I'm gettin' too old 
 What's new? Bitch, I'm in the stu' 
 Hookin' up with hurricane, mix with the flow 
 Tryna lock my wrists, mosquito, love the cold 
 If the track ain't a track then the Don come through 
 My rule number 1 is don't play a number 2 
 Talkin' with my nigga, you will end up on the news 
 Messin' with the paper that you racked up in views 
 Real, real ting, all I do is tell the truth
