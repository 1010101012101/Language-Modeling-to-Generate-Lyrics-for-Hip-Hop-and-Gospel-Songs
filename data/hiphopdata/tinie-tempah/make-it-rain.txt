Keep them dollars coming, and that's gonna make me dance 
 You wanna see some ass, I wanna see some cash 
 Keep them dollars coming, and that's gonna make me dance 
 And that's gonna make me dance, and that's gonna make me dance 
 Work it, rain trip, make it, break it rain trip 
 Work it, rain trip, make it, break it rain trip 
 Work it, rain trip, make it, break it rain trip 
 Turn up the volume, pour up pino? 
 Nigger uh this ? push my way up a couple kilos 
 I know the baddest, all she drink is misso 
 All she do is ? even Puerto Rico 
 Expensive taste, what the hell does she know? 
 She thinking ace of spades, I'm thinking verce clico 
 Only 22 and I'm on my 3rd vico 
 These niggers trying to step on me like what we earn is equal 
 Fellows ? got comers and shit 
 Ain't got no beat, ? I'm in first class, next to my thunder and shit 
 Twitter me at Tinie Tempah, quarter of a million follow my shit 
 Better busting I'm every car, like J electronic it is 
 Never fuck with, I'm champagne you ? feels 
 Now I'm in the ? got you motherfuckers playing ketchup with no mustard 
 Keep telling yours so wife tells, 'cause I ain't trying to be no husband 
 You ain't never ? no buzz like this I'm great ? analyze 
 Work it, rain trip, make it, break it rain trip 
 More whips and chains than? 
 She think she a princess 'cause she smell like ? bitch 
 Look it, smell it, sound it, but no feeling that we made it 
 Make it rain, so I gotta put my top? 
 Play the game so I gotta risk my rock up in her 
 Favorite game, I'ma get her to lick this cock up and I 
 Say no names if I get caught bottom copper 
 ? Town with the hustlers, going to pursue just to bust it up 
 Had 10 thounds, now 5 thounds gone and the bitch getting wet like she dust it up 
 Talk about cars and get embarrassed, you talk about mars and you get to paris 
 Don't get a room without a terrorist 
 What the fuck you looking at girl all these carrots, ching 
 Over freeze, I don't give a fuck if you over seas 
 Nullify a nigger that's cold to me 
 Better yet, motherfucker with a colder sleeve 
 Truly, or just caught a cold, motherfucker bout to blow a sneeze, hatchu 
 He know how we go ? in the coldest feet 
 Keep them dollars coming, and that's gonna make me dance 
 You wanna see some ass, I wanna see some cash 
 Keep them dollars coming, and that's gonna make me dance 
 And that's gonna make me dance, and that's gonna make me dance 
 Work it, rain trip, make it, break it rain trip 
 Work it, rain trip, make it, break it rain trip 
 Work it, rain trip, make it, break it rain trip.
