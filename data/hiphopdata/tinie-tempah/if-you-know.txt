 Yo, spill the juice, I'm wavey 
 My livin' room is crazy 
 I preed your life on Instagram 
 And niggas to fugazy 
 Gettin' millions from the Majors 
 You niggas ain't behavin' 
 Them boys is under pressure 
 I'm a fuckin' freak of nature 
 Yo, yo, it's all gold medallion 
 My dover's so, so Italian 
 I drove my Italian 
 Then had a flight to on the fashion 
 Yeah, yeah, it's all clear money 
 All the same jeans 
 All the same fiends 
 All the same dreams 
 Told my nigga we all the same, all the same 
 Yeah, all the same breed 
 Came up with all the same, always trained 
 Stuck with all the same team 
 And my niggas got drama 'fore the pussy 
 You know that pussy ain't free 
 I bet he gon' know you fuck with some trill ones 
 When you see the lazerbeam 
 I'm the king of this Twitter age 
 I used to give a fuck, now these pricks ain't to please 
 So now I hit sport mode in my hired car 
 When I zip from A to B 
 I think I might slide out to my hide out 
 Where it's 58 degrees 
 All my niggas interested, it's some next shit 
 Is gettin' riches ain't beef, yeah, yeah

 Used to run around with them hoes you must know 
 Now I mess with bitches that I don't even know 
 Rollin' with my G's, screamin' fuck how you feel 
 We no say no names, if you know, then you know 
 If you know, then you know 
 If you know, then you know 
 I say, we no say no names, if you know, then you know

 I swear we goin' viral 
 Y'all niggas got more ones than Michael 
 Fuck, baby, more ones than Michael Jackson 
 Them haters think I'm handsome 
 I knew them boys were [?] 
 When I saw them interactions 
 Yeah, nigga, it's all over ZZ 
 Champagne from [?] and Mason 
 I just tour and hit the basement 
 Pick a drop from the station 
 Yeah, nigga, it's all clean money 
 Doin' all the same deeds 
 Wearin' all the same drees 
 Yeah, all the same steeze 
 Tell a nigga don't spot me if you don't love me 
 You can't call to say please 
 I ain't pushin' no mixtape, this done jack shit 
 Yeah, I done more than they tweet 
 Ay nigga, like fuck you, I do drunk food 
 But I don't walk away from beef 
 You might end up on Snapchat tryna backtrack 
 When you all the way in grease 
 We ain't feelin' your sound 
 You know it don't sound like new new 
 You know my shit sound 
 You know my shit sound like voodoo, woo 
 G63, bitch, back to the BlueTooth 
 You niggas can't see me like Mewtwo 
 Mind out who you dealin' with 
 Know these niggas out stealin' shit 
 I'm always in the dealership 
 Smellin' good, feelin' ripped 
 DL, the realest clique 
 Immotent, the realest clique 
 Always in the trillest shit 
 Always on some illest shit 
 Professor in the laboratory 
 I got millis comin' andel√© 
 I like the way she whine to house 
 I'm tryna come on Valerie 
 Borderline insanity 
 I bet your daughter wanna marry me 
 Always burnin' calories 
 Flexin' like we used to, ay
