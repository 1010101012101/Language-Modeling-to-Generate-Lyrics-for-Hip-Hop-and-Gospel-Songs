 No cameras on my table 
 'Cause the consequence could be fatal 
 We got all your girlfriends in

 She went to use the toilet 
 And now she's sounding nasal 
 Before my mama had me said she saw the angel Gabriel

 Henessy, me, weed what a combination

 Nothing more important in the word than world domination 
 Gon' lick it up (shape) 
 Cash flow picking up 
 Still ain't got no patients baby, quick ain't never quick enough 
 It seems like rich ain't never rich enough 
 Bitch I'm so nasty, I'ma probably be 70 years old and happy I can still get it up 
 Drop it on me like surprise

 Dropping champagne till I'm soaked 
 Her tongue out, she gross, love it

 Presidential weed respect my vote 
 Me and Tinie Tempah doing numbers we projected hoe
