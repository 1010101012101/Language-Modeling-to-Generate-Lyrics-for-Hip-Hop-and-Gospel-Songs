I don't wanna think about you, 
 All day long. 
 I don't wanna dream about you, 
 Girl I do miss you. 
 Just a little, 
 Just a little, 
 Just a little, 
 Okay maybe more than just a little bit. 
 Yeah, I'm done confusing you girl, 
 We both come from two different worlds. 
 And you don't wanna come around mine, 
 But what happened that night was the usual drill. 
 Head over heels, with ya head over heels. 
 How many times did I say I'm no good, 
 Girl even your friends know the deal. 
 So what you phoning me still? 
 If you don't hear no evil, 
 Then you won't see no evil, 
 Girl I don't wanna be no hero. 
 We had a little fling on the dealo, 
 And I ain't really sure how I feel 
 So I'm in a club with a bottle of verclico 
 And that's why I can't let you beat my ego. 
 I don't wanna think about you, 
 All day long. 
 I don't wanna dream about you, 
 Girl I do miss you. 
 Just a little, 
 Just a little, 
 Just a little, 
 Okay maybe more than just a little bit. 
 Maybe your used to pain, 
 Love is a losing game. 
 Why'd I let you feel the flame, 
 I think I'm falling I refuse to say. 
 Usually this is never gonna work at all, 
 First of all it was too personal, 
 So when you phone me I gotta divert the call 
 'Cause when you take the lead 
 Your gonna fly the fool but I, 
 Don't wanna deal with the commotions 
 I don't do commitments, 
 I don't do devotion 
 That's why you sent a letter to me, 
 That I never opened. 
 Give me space to breathe 
 So I can deal with my emotions. 
 I don't wanna think about you, 
 All day long. 
 I don't wanna dream about you, 
 Girl I do miss you. 
 Just a little, 
 Just a little, 
 Just a little, 
 Okay maybe more than just a little bit.
