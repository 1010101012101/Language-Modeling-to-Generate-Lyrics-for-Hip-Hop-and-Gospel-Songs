99 problems but a bitch ain't one (Kobe) 
 But did you burn this God damn house right down? (Sophie) 
 Throw something at ya just for acting dumb (Naomi) 
 Show them paparazzi my bogies for being nosey 
 Yeah, I D.O. till I O.D 
 Yeah, I D.O till I O.D

 Knock knock, who's there? 
 Your daddy's worst nightmare 
 I'm mile high club flying, them other rappers Ryanair (I swear) 
 How the hell do I say this shit? 
 How the hell do I say this shit? 
 How the hell do I say this shit? 
 How the hell do I get away with this? 
 Pardon me if I swear 
 [?] fucking yeah 
 A lot of sex, drugs and rock and roll 
 But the doctors say I'm all clear 
 Got girls over there 
 Got girls over there 
 By the time the night is over they're gonna be in their underwear 
 All my greedy people get ugly 
 Specs on like I study 
 Break her heart if she love me 
 If you ain't on the jury don't judge me 
 My favourite pair of cheap Monday's 
 My belt Crocodile Dundee 
 I got David Becks on my undies 
 And I got a girl that lives in your country, ho

 I want to scream but I'm baritone 
 I'm fucking lean and I'm Sharon Stone 
 Straight up your Ali G, Sacha Baron Cohen 
 Alright I'm doing Ellie's mansion up in [?] 
 Tell the groupies no camera phones 
 It costs a lot to wear rags and bones 
 (?) 
 And bring back the bunch of tiger loans 
 We run this city like marathons 
 Disturbing London bang-a-thon 
 (?) 
 When I bang a blonde to a Cameron song 
 My sane people go mental 
 Crazy people go gentle 
 What you call it? Shut up prick, I call it experimental 
 I'm one of the UK's most influential 
 I don't really give a fuck if I offend you 
 And I've got a piece of wood in my trousers girl, which is really easy to assemble

 On my Nintendo playing Mario and Yoshi 
 Yeah ordered some mutton 
 I'm teaching Gordon Ramsey how to make a [?] 
 I put diamonds in my rose wreath 
 Cleanup on aisle five to mosh pits in row three 
 Put your fucking hands up like a goalie 
 I O.D. on Ozs but this is poetry
