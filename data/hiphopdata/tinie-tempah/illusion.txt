My neighbours keep gettin' murdered so we sleep with the alarm on 
 Bedroom filled with Nike SB's and Comme Des Garcons 
 Starin' at the ceiling listening to So-Far-Gone 
 Tryna make the world play me daily like Carson 
 My mom says I need to put on weight like Kelly Clarkson 
 She said I work like a soldier steady marchin' 
 Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right 
 Tryna keep it steady like Elizabeth Arden, ah 
 Apartments, Guard with a Garden 
 Money in the jeans, car keys in the cardigan 
 When I was a kid I wished that I could be in Narnia 
 Every time my father disregarded an argument 
 Wishing I was sitting on the moon 
 Watching videos, wishing I was living on a shoe 
 With dishonest use, doing things I didn't wanna do 
 Wishing I could see the world from a different point of view 
 Leave your baggage at the stairs 
 And your worries at the door 
 You don't have to think about problems any more 
 (I can make you believe in anything) 
 Uh, I know that everything's changed 
 But I'm under this illusion just so I don't go insane 
 (I can Make you believe in anything) 
 Uh, you ever been too fed up, to get up 
 Or wish you had a huge shredder for a few letters 
 Dreaming up these stories of these all new adventures 
 Like new Louie Vuittons on a new Cinderella 
 Check the sense of humor on the new, rumors getting better 
 Around me teachin' you a lesson, and I don't mean a lecture 
 'Cause only fake (rich, rich) dudes get jealous 
 So we'll never let a (rich, rich) dude get near us 
 'Cause were up with the stars, somewhere out of space 
 And on the underground I felt so outta place 
 I got Tom, Dick and Harry all looking at my face 
 I know they wanna say 'Safe' but, don't know how to say it 
 Bad body language, I don't understand it 
 When they see Patrick, then they turn to gangsters 
 Haha, And that's a passage from my mantra 
 I've started reading from a whole different chapter 
 I can make you, 
 I can make you, 
 I can make you, 
 Believe in anything 
 I can make you, 
 I can make you, 
 I can make you, 
 Believe in anything
