You are more than able, of cutting through the cable 
 But I see your angel, don't act young and wasteful 
 Come to garden and let your guard down 
 Come to your senses it will all be clear 
 Yeah, yeah (ah) 
 I tell stunners I'm stone cold and Austin Powers 
 Too busy working, all my niggas talking about power 
 I made vow that I won't end up like Kenny Powers 
 When the money goes and friendships turn sour 
 Still rapping with soul 'cause I never sold mine 
 For the whole time did it without a co-sign 
 They can't approach their sheet the way I approach mine 
 Dumi knew that he stumbled on a goldmine 
 They think you buss and it's all roses and daffodils 
 I coulda moved off ends, but I'm in Hackney still 
 I could of S-curled my hair, my hair is nappy still 
 I showed you the most how to make the most out of crappy deal 
 Opened doors everybody getting signed now 
 I having mean with Greatest of all times now 
 I never do it off of the top, I gotta write it down 
 Ask the hackers all bars up on my iCloud 
 Still fresher than Brok' Beckham and Ash Catchem 
 Took my beanie back to Plumstead and thenback to Peckham 
 Todays beef then tomorrow your friends 
 Rappers unfollow you, then follow you and then unfollow you again 
 I tell him a man his face I got a problem with him, straight 
 I can take your girl in woven sandals and turn her to Naomi Campbell 
 Horror stories I'm so weary of divorce 
 I might move to North Korea because my career is heading north 
 You ain't see us in the wagon then I swear it was the Porsche 
 Take my niggas to LA where this ain't against the law 
 I ain't scared of no lawsuit, word to my tailor 
 I didn't even ask Calvin when he took us out to Vegas 
 They wanna see us down, they don't want see us up 
 And when Harry cuts his hair whole worlds going nuts 
 You are more than able, of cutting through that cable 
 But I see your angel, don't sound and wasteful 
 Come to garden and let your guard down 
 Come to senses it will all be clear 
 I just wanna be the light you wanna see 
 The star in your eyes, the glimmer in the shadow 
 I just wanna be the light you wanna see 
 The star in your eyes, the glimmer in the shadow 
 Let me roll with you and [?] 
 Let me roll with you, all your pieces in your grand design
