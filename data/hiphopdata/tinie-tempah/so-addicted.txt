 Bei Maejor 
 Boy Wonder, Uh Huh 
 Ch'yeah, TINIE 
 Let's go 
 Woo 
 Yeah, Let's go (I like this one) 
 (Verse 1 - Tinie) 
 Round of applause baby, you should take a bow, 
 Why don't you soak it up, just like a paper towel, 
 I travel round the world, I never stay in town, 
 You never kick a fuss, you never make a sound, 
 'Cause of my situation, it's hard to take you out, 
 That's why I put my all in when I lay you down, 
 Haha, And I'm cheeky but she never stop me, 
 And they say if you gonna do it you should do it properly, 
 Baby you're my superstition, 
 You be doin' things for me that ain't even in your tradition, 
 And you're always playin' your position, 
 You pick what happens next, baby it's your decision, 
 (Chorus - Bei Maejor) 
 I'm so addicted to your lovin' and I need it fixed yeah, 
 Every time we get a moment I'm on it, 
 Every time we get a moment I'm on it, 
 Every second I be thinkin' about you, 
 Yeah I be thinkin' about you, 
 Every time we get a moment I'm on it, 
 Shawty got me like, 
 Wayo wayo wayo wayo way (x4) 
 (Verse 2 - Tinie) 
 Yeah there's only two ways this is gonna go, 
 You're either gonna end up with me or you're gonna go, 
 And I ain't tryna leave ya feelin' insecure and vulnerable, 
 So I ain't gonna front or hide the feelins that I wanna show, 
 You got me actin' kinda different with ya, 
 I must admit, I'm kinda smittin' with ya, 
 And every time you come to mine I start cleanin' shit up, 
 I can maybe wanna see me livin' with ya, 
 You know you gotta winner when your mother miss her, 
 I think you the spittin' image of your mother's younger pictures, 
 You ain't ever round no other nigga, 
 You a bad chick ain't nobody fuckin' with ya, 
 (Chorus - Bei Maejor) 
 I'm so addicted to your lovin' and I need it fixed yeah, 
 Every time we get a moment I'm on it, 
 Every time we get a moment I'm on it, 
 Every second I be thinkin' about you,

 Every time we get a moment I'm on it,

 You know how to make me feel better 'cause you're ill.
