Be still. 
 What you see is not a time, 
 The sky will light before you, 
 You'll be lost and found again, 
 This is only good for you, 
 Don't try to understand, the colours in my hand, 
 Just close your eyes and I will guide you, 
 I'm an extra terrestrial, 
 Came up out the fucking dirt like a vegetable, 
 Find out what ma cerebellum for, 
 When I pin the boof and told montana press record, 
 Little Patrick didn't catch a little leprechaun, 
 (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah) 
 Where my paracetomol, 
 I done took some pain then I turned it in to pleasure, 
 I beat rapper son of a batchelors now I'm the most eligible, 
 Ha ha ha stupid motherfucker how you like that, 
 How do I go back to this when I've already tried that, 
 This is from my inner child, said he wants his life back 
 I done turn myself into a product with a price tag, 
 All these fuckin' people only round me 'cause I'm doing well, 
 I'vel be living life like I got no regard for human health, 
 We done shed blood, sweat, tears and fought tooth and nail, 
 Tryin' to accomplish something more and just a fewer have fell, 
 And every other day, mommy call me just to ask me if I'm coping with the fame, 
 But every other night I'm spilling vodka on some chicken heads, 
 Doing shit I know would make her totally ashamed, 
 I am overly engaged, 
 Some who know me think l've changed, 
 Due to certain sudden circumstances we are socially estranged, 
 ('Stranged, 'stranged, 'stranged...) 
 Yeah, 
 I'm in tip-top shape called me fitness instructor T, 
 Super-mad-genetics in my genes, dungarees, 
 I can see these niggas through my gross and cutler piece 
 Its lonly at the top but u, can't fuckin' beat the luxury, 
 Standing at a hundred feet, this is the Disc-Overy, 
 Tinie is the name, disturbing London is the company, 
 This is the Disc-Overy, everything infront of me, 
 I ain't even worried about anything, that's under me, 
 Standing at a hundred feet, this is the Disc-Overy, 
 Tinie is the name, disturbing London is the company, 
 This is the Disc-Overy, the point of no recovery, 
 I don't give a fuck, I'm going in cover me! 
 What you see is not a time, 
 The sky will light before you, 
 You'll be lost and found again, 
 This is only good for you, 
 Don't try to understand, the colours in my hand 
 Just close your eyes and I will guide you, 
 Be still.
