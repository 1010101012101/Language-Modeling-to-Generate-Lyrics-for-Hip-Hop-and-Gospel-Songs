 Your love is my rehab 
 Few times up on a Wednesday 
 Hell yeah, hear my friends' advice 
 But I don't hear what my friends say 
 (Tinie Tempah:) 
 Yeah, young man lookin' for the Jumpman 
 Tryna say good and livin' in [?] 
 Feelin' like young J, tryna make Blueprint 
 Used to have reason, on my old laptop 
 But never still produce it 
 Used to gettin' clean cuts, [?] 
 Tryna make a little movement 
 T Jazz, Henry, okay 
 Niggas in my whip lookin' so bae 
 Rap carpool karaoke 
 Miss Cool's like, "Annie are you okay?" 
 You had just turned 21 
 I was 19, naive, very young 
 Gettin' high, eatin' Chinese, gettin' drunk 
 You let me on but you never used to let me come but let me come

 Love is my rehab 
 Few times up on a Wednesday 
 Hell yeah, hear my friends' advice

 Yeah, yeah, virgin, uh 
 Virgin, I was still a virgin 
 Tryna do theory and we dropped Rehab 
 I was still learnin' 
 Runnin' from the bayless, tryna get playlist 
 Say I'm too urban then I made a banger 
 Then I lost grammar 
 Couldn't make it to to the surface 
 Kells didn't think it was right 
 I didn't think at the time 
 Just gettin' into this life 
 Heard he was prayin' and prayin' 
 And prayin' and prayin' till I was big time 
 Then Prince started turnin' to intuition 
 It's was either this, drop or go prison 
 Suck a little bit when nobody saw the vision 
 You know what it is, you the only one who listened, yeah

 Daddy, daddy doing work 
 Mama, mama doing church 
 Copper, preaches doing birds 
 Couple exes doing worse 
 I don't need your jealousy, yeah 
 I don't need your therapy, yeah 
 'Cause love is my rehab 
 Few times up on a Wednesday 
 Hell yeah, hear my friends' advice
