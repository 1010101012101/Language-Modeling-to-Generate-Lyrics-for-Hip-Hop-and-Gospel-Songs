Yeah. Uh 
 I think my reflection is relatively jealous of me, that's all. 
 Twittering on my Apple, hoping I don't get hassled 
 Before I reach my goal or till people have to be tackled. 
 I don't jump on anybody's bandwagon or saddle 
 I'm X-rated, I'm adult, this ain't the Disney channel. 
 I'm hotter than a candle wick, I'm fire. (fire) 
 Closer to everything I desire 
 'Cause I don't listen to doubt, Doubt is a liar. 
 Stop actin' like a bitch. Don't be Mrs. Doubtfire. 
 It don't get no flyer, fam, I'm on the cloud higher, higher, higher, higher. 
 Different vehicles same tires, 
 I turn quiet into riot. 
 Listen to my silence... 
 This is like a curse. 
 This is like a blessin'. 
 I can hear your voice. 
 I can feel your presence. 
 You keep me confused. 
 You keep me guessin'. 
 But I'm back for seconds, it's an obsession 
 It's an obsession 
 It's an obsession 
 This is like a curse. 
 This is like a blessin'. 
 But I'm back for seconds, It's an obsession 
 P.O.M me, her mill bringin' the medley. 
 Hot MC over any. I'm cold, cold as February. 
 Repress my oldest memories.I hoovered them with a Henry. 
 Now they're gone, They no longer exist, You get me? 
 I'm standin' with a Remy and a backpack full of twenties, 
 Talkin' to somethin' sexy, I'ma hit it if she lets me. 
 Don't judge me till you've read me 
 Cause 9 times outta 10, I don't even get me. 
 But I'm ready, or not, Hear I come 
 Wherever you hide, 
 I bet you I'ma find ya 
 I am not a skateboard dubber, I'ma grinda. 
 I turn quiet into riot. 
 Listen to my silence... 
 This is like a curse. 
 This is like a blessin'. 
 I can hear your voice. 
 I can feel your presence. 
 You keep me confused. 
 You keep me guessin'. 
 But I'm back for seconds, it's an obsession 
 It's an obsession 
 It's an obsession 
 This is like a curse. 
 This is like a blessin'. 
 But I'm back for seconds, It's an obsession 
 Obsession. The kid with lots of questions 
 Take take note, life is just a long lesson. 
 My daddy was present, But sometimes forgot my presents. 
 Like when I was 7. 
 Helicopters revvin', Posh wedding's. 
 One well expensive watch, dots 
 Everyday, I'm on leggy blondes who put on wedding rings 
 But after one heavy drink, I on anything. 
 So while they make me feel so used for that sued for 
 Doors racin' through my mind like a new Porsche With the roof off 
 Every single time I rhyme, It's science. 
 I turn quiet into riot, 
 Listen to my silence... 
 This is like a curse. 
 This is like a blessin'. 
 I can hear your voice. 
 I can feel your presence. 
 You keep me confused. 
 You keep me guessin'. 
 But I'm back for seconds, it's an obsession 
 It's an obsession 
 It's an obsession 
 This is like a curse. 
 This is like a blessin'. 
 But I'm back for seconds, It's an obsession
