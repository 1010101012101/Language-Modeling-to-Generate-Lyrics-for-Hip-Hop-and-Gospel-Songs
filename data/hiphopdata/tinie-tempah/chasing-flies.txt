 Ba ba black sheep, rock star, rap G 
 Make enough dough to own a black car, that's speed 
 I been gettin' blow, fuckin' friendly with the banks, man 
 And I don't mean Phil Carter, Hillary or Astley 
 Packs see me up in the vicinity and flash me 
 I'm the definition of definitive and catchy 
 The only thing that's bigger, quicker, slicker 
 More black and more upper London is a taxi 
 Bitch, I'm so sick I need a motherfuckin' vacine 
 Pinky ring shine like so motherfuckin' vastly 
 Center of attention like a bank anthem, lost 'em 
 HDB, reachin' for a flat screen 
 The only other time I see you niggas on kisses 
 Is like 2AM or when you go to fuck her up 
 Look, 60 m4, baby, need to buckle up 
 All my wheelers so zoo, all my wheelers go nuts, yeah 
 (Tinie Tempah and Nea:) 
 Don't say that I didn't ever warn ya 
 Swear down, I told ya 
 We is the original of our time 
 Don't cross the line 
 Don't make me have to show ya 
 Don't say that I didn't ever warn ya 
 Stop lyin', I saw ya 
 We is the original of our time 
 Don't cross the line 
 Don't make me have to show ya 
 (Tinie Tempah:) 
 So raw and uncut, no fuckin' edit 
 So won't even get her hype, she made no fuckin' effort 
 And all you silly singers and you ringtone rappers 
 Like school dinner currys, don't fuckin' get it 
 My car is unleaded, yard ripper terrace 
 She call me chauvinistic, bet she can't even spell it 
 I don't wanna hear another nigga say you fly 
 If you ain't never been on business class on the Emirates 
 I'm a racket, I'm tennis, I'm Dennis, I'm a menace 
 Call me Robert Pattinson, I got a lot of niggas jealous 
 Out my mental, minted like [?] 
 That's tic tic tic tic, boom to you fellas 
 Some boy, nigga, Martin Margiela 
 Ain't littin' if her name ain't Remy or Stella 
 Got a big back of tricks, Mary Poppins umbrella 
 'Cause 'bout to rain on them like London weather, yeah 
 (Tinie Tempah and Nea:) 
 Don't say that I didn't ever warn ya 
 Swear down, I told ya 
 We is the original of our time 
 Don't cross the line 
 Don't make me have to show ya 
 Don't say that I didn't ever warn ya 
 Stop lyin', I saw ya 
 We is the original of our time 
 Don't cross the line 
 Don't make me have to show ya
