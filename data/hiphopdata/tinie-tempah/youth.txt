Yeah, last year was no practise year 
 Let's get more number 1's and more plaques this year 
 I say a lot of blurry lines, let's talk facts this year 
 I might even try goin' back to masters year 
 Yeah, told bro that I ain't jokin' this year 
 Told wifey I might even give up smokin' this year 
 Told Dumi I'ma rap with more emotion this year 
 Keep the doors wide open this year 
 I been coastin' but the last few years have been weird 
 I'm even self assured I'm scared, that's how I deal with the fear 
 People speakin' on my name 
 If you could feel the burnin' in my ears, type of pain that can bring a man to tears 
 But I'm here still, man's gon' clear, clear, clear still 
 Rock in a hard place, label tryna make us do it their way 
 We tellin' them we wanna do it our way 
 Everythin' is homegrown, comin' like a garvey 
 Young Rico, swave 
 Everythin' to me is blaze 
 Told her I could check to make the whole thing parkay 
 3 piece on, Prince of Wales check 
 Freddy on the boat sayin', "Where we gonna sail next?" 
 Where I come from, we talk about what's goin' down next 
 Not everyone's a shotta, but everybody's runnin' from a coppa 
 And nobody wants to be the blocka 
 16, sat up, buy a chick with a cut 
 Yeah, after shot days, seein' Saint James on the block days 
 New Balance flex days, Morleys on the S days 
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, you don't remember that 
 Night bust, New Years Eve, want December back 
 All these memories, these memories I'm holdin' 
 Next thing I know I end up on the road 
 Toured Usher, Drizzy even toured with Cole 
 Then I give a girl my soul 
 And next thing you know I'm turnin' 28 years old 
 Whoa, gettin' older, things I seen make me turn colder 
 Top down, sittin' in this roadster 
 In these funny times, it's important that we're closer 
 Started meditation and I started doin' yoga 
 Killin' all these rappers I'm the scene's Casasosa 
 We got four Benz' and make 'em drop it on my chauffeur 
 We about to get this bread poppin' like a toaster 
 If you don't get it now, you'll get it when you're older, aha 
 Yeah, youth, aha
