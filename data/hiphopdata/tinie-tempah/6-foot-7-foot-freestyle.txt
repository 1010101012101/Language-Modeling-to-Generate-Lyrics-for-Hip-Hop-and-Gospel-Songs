Man, f-ck them other rappers 
 I don't hear no one that's sounding good 
 Call me the wolf, I got a little red riding hood 
 When we in the club, women try to push and try to look 
 If the drink don't do it, than I bet them f-cking diamonds would 
 I'm off the rails, n-gga I'm a head case 
 Tryna take it to another level like a stair case 
 Traded in a thousand times to be a millionaire mate 
 I take off and land in a very private air space 
 Okay, I'm crazy and insane, crazy and deranged 
 I'm so far ahead they tryna chase me in a train 
 Got them other rappers feeling lazy and ashamed 
 You know you're doing something right when Jay-Z knows your name 
 And I ain't bothered by the fame but I'm addicted to this lifestyle 
 Girls so starstruck she write her number twice down 
 All I see is numbers I don't f-cking waste time n-gga 
 All I do is numbers call me 789!
