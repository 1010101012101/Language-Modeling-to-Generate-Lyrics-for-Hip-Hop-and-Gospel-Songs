(Tinie:) 
 Oh my golly gosh shit 
 I think I lost it 
 I be what they talking 'bout 
 And why they gossip 
 This for them ghetto kids 
 And them posh kids 
 I make 'em turn there speakers up a couple notches 
 Them Jordan Spizikes on my feet looking spotless 
 I be on that heavy metal wave and that rock shit 
 Bitch I'm thirty thousand feet meet me in my cock pit 
 I be in the middle of a motherfuckin' mosh pit 
 Living kinda lavish 
 Fashion week in Milan fashion week in Paris 
 Everyday I'm fucking some one different on my mattress 
 I be one night standing I ain't tryna be romantic 
 Yeah they call me Tinie but I'm bout to be gigantic 
 It's a madness every single time I'm landing back in Stanstead 
 Did my thing up at the Brits 
 And now I'm eyeing up the Grammys 
 The music got me moshing like I'm angry 
 Mind over matter 
 You ain't even on my level you don't even matter [x2] 
 Where my fucking mosh pit [x4] 
 Oi watch how I handle this like Ong back 
 Pure elbows 
 Mind out mind out mind out 
 (Dizzee:) 
 Rocking a roley 
 Got my dick on your girlfriends shoulder 
 And I'm far from sober 
 Ain't nobody controlling or holding me 
 I'm breaking the law breaking the law 
 See me in a mosh pit step to me 
 What are you waiting for 
 What are you hating for 
 All I do is back beef 
 What do you cater for? 
 Worldwide jet setter 
 I'm gonna take a tour 
 You're gonna date a hoar 
 She's gonna take you for a fifty fifty 
 With that bullshit miss me 
 Got a pocket full of pounds and they're extra crispy 
 Top boy in my town you can check the history 
 I'm a stone cold bredder and I'm extra misty 
 And I fight like a gypsy 
 Flier than a six speed 
 Going somewhere fly where the chicks be 
 Keep a couple high bredders with me 
 Roll up the spliff take a hit of this piff G quickly 
 Now I'm rolling stoned and I'm in my zone 
 I'm a east side bredder yeah that's my home 
 It's the land of the hammers better watch your tone 
 You don't wanna see me put a hammer in your dome 
 I'm Iron maiden you breeders are fading 
 I'm running this game what the hell are you playing 
 What the hell are you saying 
 And my crew come through balls on parade 
 And you don't wanna be brave 
 You just wanna behave 
 And all I wanna do is kick back in the Caymans 
 But I don't mind killing you for entertainment 
 Nobody can save ya 
 Call Jesus Christ or just change your life 
 You ain't playing alright 'cause you ain't the type 
 Don't know why you wanna be up in the hype 
 When I'm in the mosh pit all day and night 
 Don't chat to me if you ain't ready to fight alright. 
 Mind over matter 
 You ain't even on my level you don't even matter [x2] 
 Where my fucking mosh pit [x4]
