Run it, oh 
 Yo 
 Ear Drummers 
 I ain't even got a blunt right now? 
 This ain't me, who this is? 
 Oh, you sayin' I done changed on ya, how I changed on ya? 
 You were never one of my niggas, you were never one of my homies 
 Tell me how? I said, "Damn, e'rrbody want a piece when you're up" 
 When you're down, ain't nobody 'round, tell me what the fuck? 
 Oh, you sayin' I done changed on ya, how I changed on ya? 
 You were never one of my niggas, you were never one of my homies 
 Tell me how? I said, "Damn, e'rrbody want a piece when you're up" 
 When you're down, ain't nobody 'round, tell me what the fuck? Huh? 
 Damn, I done came up, now a nigga stackin' green 
 I could go and buy Supreme but I'm in love with Gucci jeans 
 Shawty in love with my steez, bring these bitches to their knees 
 I got all this fuckin' swag and I can't even (sigh) 
 I can't even stop it 
 All these watches that I want, I stack it up, then cop it 
 Guess the lesson of the day is keep stackin' your dollar 
 And them bitches chasin' me so I ain't gotta holla 
 Oh, you sayin' I done changed on ya, how I changed on ya? 
 You were never one of my niggas, you were never one of my homies 
 Tell me how? I said, "Damn, e'rrbody want a piece when you're up"

 When you're down, ain't nobody 'round, tell me what the fuck? Huh? 
 Ay, I feel like Jay-Z the way I'm pullin' strings 
 Feel like I wrote the book the way I'm runnin' game 
 They think I'm a crook the way I take her 
 I don't even wanna call the hoe 'cause she on go 
 Ay, Uncle Jxmmi fresh, I'm talkin' head to toe 
 Ay, I'm still puttin' on for Tupelo 
 Ay, I treat a 20 like a groupie hoe 
 Head down, head up, get down on the floor 
 Oh, you sayin' I done changed on ya, how I changed on ya? 
 You were never one of my niggas, you were never one of my homies 
 Tell me how? I said, "Damn, e'rrbody want a piece when you're up"
