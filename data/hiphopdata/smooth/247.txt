Tick tick tock 
 Smooth the MC, top quality 
 I'm hot like a tamale and stinging like a bee 
 Who can collect of and you love me 
 I feel no competition because there's none 
 I'm waiting for the equal, no one could be the sequel 
 I'm the lawyer and now it's getting legal 
 When I'm on the mike you have a question span 
 I was gonna say run but you had already ran away 
 Tick tick tock all around the clock, 24/7 how she plays 
 Listen close to the dope rhymes that Smooth displays 
 She'll take a moment for and upon it just a little bit of time 
 But 24/7 is how often Smooth drops a dope rhyme 
 I'm always in search for what I deserve 
 My rhymes are clear and do not swerve 
 I can excite, get you uptight and prove that I do it right 
 'Cause I'm quick, I don't slip from the bottom the tip 
 All others are ripping of lips I zip 
 Count again from one to eleven 
 As I prove I do it 24/7 
 Tick tick tock all around the clock, 24/7 how she plays 
 Listen close to the dope rhymes that Smooth displays 
 She'll take a moment for and upon it just a little bit of time 
 But 24/7 is how often Smooth drops a dope rhyme 
 Tick tick tock 24/7 
 Lyrically strapped, my mike's a full pack 
 Nothing I lack I just don't wanna not like that 
 All will know by the sound of my voice that I'm top choice, properly poised 
 I'm a professional, unexceptional 
 I will lead you on and probably let you go 
 'Cause I rhyme on time, you will find I'm divine from the mind, yeah 
 The 24/7 line
