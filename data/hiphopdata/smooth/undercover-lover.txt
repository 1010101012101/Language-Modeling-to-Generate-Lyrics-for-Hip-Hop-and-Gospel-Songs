How far do you really wanna go (do you really wanna go) 
 'Cause we could take it all the way down 
 Understand, I already have a man 
 I'll see you when I can 
 Baby, there's no need to rush 
 Here's my pager number, baby, keep in touch 
 But keep it on the hush-hush 
 No one need's to know 
 Undercover lover, secret affair 
 On the down low, baby, I can be there 
 Keep it on the down 
 No one needs to know 
 Keep it on the low 
 Keep it low, baby, low 
 Undercover lover, secret affair 
 Ooh, like that 
 On the down low 
 Baby, I can be there 
 Can't nobody do me like you do 
 Keep it on the down, the down 
 No one need's to know 
 It's time for a secret rendezvous 
 Ooh, and I really wanna get real freaky with you 
 As long as you stay around, baby, we can play around 
 Don't be afraid of my flavor 
 Keep it on the down 
 It's on, it's on 
 I'm on my knees for you, baby 
 How far do you really wanna go 
 Down, round and round 
 Ooh, like that, yeah like that, real low 
 Oh baby, I wanna go low 
 Down low 
 No one needs to know 
 Keep it on the low 
 I can be there, oh yeah 
 No one needs to know 
 Anytime, any place, we can lay, we can play 
 Juanita will never do you wrong 
 I'm feenin' for you, baby 
 Kiss me from head to toe, down down low 
 Knock my boots until you can't knock no more 
 A little here, a little there 
 Get freaky with me 
 Undercover lover 
 I wanna be there for you, I do 
 Keep it on the low 
 Keep it on the low, the low 
 No one, no one needs to know 
 Oh, meet me, meet me at our favorite place at our favorite time 
 And I'll love you down 
 Ooh, I'll love you down, I will, I will, ooh, I will 
 Sneak me a little love sometimes 
 Oh, sometimes I just need you 
 All I need from you: low, low 
 Keep it on the low 
 Undercover lover 
 Keep it on the down, the down 
 No one, no one needs to know 
 Ooh, baby, just you and me 
 Don't tell a soul 
 Ooh, real low, real low, yeah yeah 
 Go down, baby 
 Down, low low, no one needs to know
