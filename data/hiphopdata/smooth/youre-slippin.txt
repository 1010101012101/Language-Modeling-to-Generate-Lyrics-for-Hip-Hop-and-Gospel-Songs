(You are, you are) 
 Another one down 
 (You are slipping) 
 What's happening to our people today? 
 Another one slipped 
 Yeah, slip 
 Rolling through your hoodie with your drop top Beamer 
 Mister got it going on, now he's just a dreamer 
 You used to be a baller but it's twisted 
 Slipped for your grip, now you're headed for the system 
 Addicted to to bull but body's full 
 Lost all your money so you lost all your pull 
 You should have recognized me before it hits 
 Now you're just another one who's about to slip 
 (You are slipping) 
 Then there's a girl, the one we all know on his elbow 
 'Cause he's got all the dough 
 Plenty of jewels but now he's in a hell 
 He lost all his money, two babies and now daddy's going to jail 
 What does she do? She never finished school 
 She needs to make some money so she gots to knock the boots 
 She used to roll a Honda Accord, but now she's living in a house made of cardboard 
 Saying "Pass it to me, baby" 
 Meaning the pipe because she's smoking like crazy 
 What they're about to do is take her two babies 
 The biggest game in life is when you game yourself 
 But em, Smooth is here to help 
 You should have recognized me before it hits 
 Now you're just another one who's about to slip 
 (You are slipping) 
 What are we doing? 
 We got to get it together 
 Can't slip no more 
 We got to get it straight y'all 
 They calling me calling me Smooth 
 They calling me calling me Smooth one
