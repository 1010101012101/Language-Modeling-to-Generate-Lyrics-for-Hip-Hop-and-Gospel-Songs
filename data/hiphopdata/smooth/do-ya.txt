Do you love me or are you only playing games? 
 I need to know, babe 
 Do you want me or are you only playing games? 
 Won't be too picky when we're kicking it 
 You've got that love and I'm loving it 
 No need to rush, baby, I can put it on your satisfaction guarantee 
 I better warn you 
 Cause dinner and a movie it'll soothe me 
 That's the way I like to start it off 
 Any other way, it won't do me 
 Do you love me or are you only playing games? 
 Tell me, I got to know 
 Do you love me or are you only playing games? 
 Is it just a game? 
 Pretty little baby when I'm loving you 
 There's nothing I would rather do 
 Than wake up in the morning laying next to you 
 Cause dinner and a movie it'll soothe me 
 That's the way I like to start it off 
 Any other way, it won't do me, yeah 
 Do you love me or are you only playing games? 
 I wanna know if it's a game, babe 
 Do you love me or are you only playing games? 
 Do you love me, baby? I gotta know 
 Are you playing or is it love? 
 Do you want me or is it a game? 
 Do you love me or are you only playing games? 
 Do you love me? Do you hear what I'm saying? Do you love me? 
 Are you only playing games? Do you hear, baby?
