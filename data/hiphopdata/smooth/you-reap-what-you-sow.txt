You can't judge a man by his cover 
 As all women soon will discover 
 They say they're whack and there's a feedback 
 Intelligence that a woman don't lack, yo 
 They're all around talking a drag 
 Talk about the girlies that they always have had 
 But it's time for me to set them straight 
 Yeah, to demonstrate that I can penetrate the mind 
 I can use you up to the blind 
 Play it really cool to make you think that you're mine 
 Then let you go and let you find someone new and she'll diss you too 
 Treat you bad and treat you like a fool 
 But oh yo, I can't respect when I find a man I put him in check 
 That's how it'll go cause you reap what you sow 
 You reap what you sow, what you do comes back to you 
 I said I'd never do it but I did it anyway 
 I fell in love with this fellow one day 
 He said that he'd love me, truly he did 
 That we were getting married and we would have kids 
 I didn't know the things, the things that he was doing 
 I'm the one that's usually fooling 
 Everybody told me that it was down 
 That what goes around it will come back around 
 Well, guys say girl, girl, nothing but trouble 
 But it goes that way it goes the way double 
 Your strategy, played like no other 
 Everybody warned me even my mother 
 Reigning supreme, you know what I mean 
 I was sprung, not addicted more like a feen 
 He dissed me smooth, that's how it goes, you reap what you sow 
 You reap what you sow, what you do comes back to you 
 You reap what you sow 
 You reap what you sow 
 What goes up must come down 
 Just like what goes around comes back around 
 You know what you dish you also got to eat 
 Cause everything in your life is on a two way streak 
 Don't overpark, yeah, you get a ticket 
 If you know what I'm saying don't be wicked 
 Love 'em to leave em, make 'em to break em 
 You say you wanna love em, now you fake em 
 I don't know how to express or should I say confess 
 You say you wanna get with me, try and see what it can be 
 Try to diss a girl, not knowing this is a woman's world 
 Well, that is how it will go cause you reap what you sow 
 You reap what you sow, what you do comes back to you 
 You reap what you sow 
 You reap what you sow, what you do comes back to you 
 You reap what you sow
