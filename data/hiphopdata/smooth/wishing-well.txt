Wishing well, oh 
 Wishing well 
 If you had a wish what would it be 
 Would you wish to be rich or happy? 
 Would you wish to go to heaven. what's your destiny? 
 Would you wish to save your life or take your own? 
 Anything goes at the wishing well 
 Toss your coin and make a wish 
 Toss your coin and make a wish 
 Wishing well, throw your money in me 
 And I will grant you one wish, anything you want it to be 
 Wishing well, throw your money in me 
 And if you make the wrong wish no turning back, baby 
 If you had one wish what would it be 
 Would you wish to start your life all over? 
 Would you wish for all your sins to pass? 
 Would you wish for a peace of mind? 
 Anything goes at the wishing well 
 Toss your coin and make a wish 
 Toss your coin and make a wish 
 Wishing well, throw your money in me 
 And I will grant you one wish, anything you want it to be 
 Wishing well, throw your money in me 
 And if you make the wrong wish no turning back, baby 
 Anything happens at the wishing well 
 Anything happens at the wishing well 
 The wishing well 
 Toss your coin and make a wish 
 Toss your coin and make a wish 
 Anything happens at the wishing well 
 Wishing well, throw your money in me 
 And I will grant you one wish, anything you want it to be 
 Wishing well, throw your money in me 
 And if you make the wrong wish no turning back, baby 
 Wishing well, throw your money in me 
 And I will grant you one wish, anything you want it to be
