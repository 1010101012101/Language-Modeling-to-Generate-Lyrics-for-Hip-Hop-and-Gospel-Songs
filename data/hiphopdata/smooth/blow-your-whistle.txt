Poetically I must explain 
 The title of queen I must gain 
 Gain to take over the rule to make over 
 I gotta quote 
 My rhymes are kinda dope 
 It's like hangman on a rope 
 Come let it down 
 A couple more to quotes to go on react 
 I won't attack 
 I won't lack 
 My rhymes are to the point exact 
 'Cause I'm a bomb 
 I'm ready to explode 
 'Cause I'm a soloist 
 You don't want none of this 
 So, disappear sucker before you get me really pissed 
 I gotta take to first 
 I never can be last 
 I'm like a Uzi 
 I'm always ready to blast 
 I gave you a chance to romance, create a new dance and have the fellows pranced 
 Like a reindeer always in fear of the reappear 
 But I will let up and come back into the break and amaze till the end of days 
 I gotta blow my whistle 
 Blow your whistle 
 I do damage 
 Hurt any in my way 
 Oh yeah, and I'm straight from L.A. 
 And that's OK 
 'Cause I still slay anybody that steps in my way 
 I'm the S the M the double O T H 
 And when I'm on the mike everybody seems to hate Smooth 
 I'm the judge, more like a terminator 
 Come on my way I can show you like a disintegrator 
 Ready for the attention I deserve 
 So come on 'cause I am ready to serve 
 Every female is scared of me 
 Guys, they want to get with me 
 MCs are my enemy 
 I'm the epitomy 
 Speaking of Brooklyn, never mention L.A. 
 'Cause I'm Smooth, I only do it one way 
 That's to say as I explained 
 Now listen close as I say 
 I'm blowing up my whistle 
 Tell 'em what time it is, Smooth 
 Tell 'em what rhyme it is 
 We're in the rhythm, you know what I'm saying, yeah 
 I'm blowing up my whistle 
 Blow your whistle 
 Move em, groove em 
 Groove it to em, Smooth 
 Let it flow, you know what I'm saying 
 Let it blow 
 Nope, the roof is blowing up for that soap 
 You children got soaked over easy like a dough 
 You're a toy, I'm gonna play you like your motha 
 Instead of a battle I'm gonna whack you with the paddle 
 I give no respect to those who neglect 
 See, perpetrating with a serious complex 
 Because somebody told me they were kinda nice 
 Well let me get prolific, exact and precise 
 Gs like you got one thing in common 
 Your rhymes are all long and soft like Top Ramen 
 Itchy short like all your curry 
 That's why it takes a boy like Smooth to burn it 
 Yo, that's what I do 
 I don't get mad 
 Just even do it do 
 I roll 'em up for strip 
 That's the truth 
 I check one, check two 
 I got my whole crew 
 I blow my whistle 
 Blow your whistle 
 I blow my whistle 
 I wanna send a shoutout to my one and only James 
 To my brother Chris 
 To my Mother, Love Force, Doreen, Joan and Helen 
 I can't forget yours truly 
 For definitely hyping up the beat box 
 The Jawbone Crew, the Movement X, Project X 
 To my dancers, cause and effect 
 Toya T, Brotha Arap, Core Productions, Crush 
 To my management, can't forget my engineers Ray 
 To my buddies and M J Dawn Shelly and Monique 
 Tony from the Hiphop City 
 Peace 
 And to all of those who think they got a grippin' 
 You're slippin' 
 See ya 
 I'm blowing my whistle
