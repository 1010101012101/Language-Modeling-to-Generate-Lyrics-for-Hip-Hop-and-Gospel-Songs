What up Momo 
 What up Smooth 
 You know straight kicking it 
 About to drop another one with the Psycho Squad 
 And I'm straight mackin' 
 She's a female mac now 
 More like gangster but more like a pimpstress 
 I'm a female mac now 
 She's a female mac now 
 More like gangster but more like a pimpstress 
 I'm a female mac now 
 I was cruisin' through the city me n Mo'Mo pull out the pager 
 Pops and Immature cause I was on my worst behavior 
 Nasty, nasty, naughty, like the way I move my body 
 Scream "Pump it, hottie" (pump it, hottie) 
 Pump on the flow, let me know if you want more (we want more) 
 They call me erotic, exotic 
 But there's a flip side, so abide 
 She's a female mac now 
 More like gangster but more like a pimpstress 
 I'm a female mac now 
 Who can you trust if you can't trust me? 
 Call'm mister Crazy, cuz he's out for my kittie-kittie 
 But you know season so I can't forget mittens 
 So, hey, how you doin', baby (cool) 
 Hey, how you doin', baby 
 You better watch your back and you better tell your lady 
 Cause um, I'm sure that you don't understand 
 I'm the type of woman that might take your man 
 Ooh lala, it's SMOOTH, I look just right, come hold my body tight 
 See, my nature is naughty, I'm naughty by life 
 Create that as simple because I'm out of spite 
 Now I'ma tell you on a sneak creep trip 
 I'm a undercover sneaker freak 
 She's a female mac now 
 More like gangster but more like a pimpstress 
 I'm a female mac now 
 Well, um, you'll discover that maybe I have an undercover lover 
 But that brother, he's livin' sweet but shady 
 I roll a Lex while you roll your Mercedes 
 I work the rip appeal, make it feel like a thrill, but it's not 
 Rubbin' me in the right way, hit me in the right spot and ooh, baby 
 You like that, right? 
 She's a female mac now 
 More like gangster but more like a pimpstress 
 I'm a female mac now 
 Kinda like a gangster 
 I may wanna pimp you
