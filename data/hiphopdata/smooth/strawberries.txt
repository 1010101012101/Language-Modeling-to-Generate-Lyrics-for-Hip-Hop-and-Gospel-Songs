 The store is open, boy 
 Won't you come inside? 
 There're some goodies on isle 69 
 (Let me love you down) 
 Your appetite for love is what I like 
 Oh, won't you let me give you some of this chocolate tonight 
 I feel like sippin' on Cristal tonight 
 Maybe Hennessey up on the candlelight 
 (I like that) 
 Run some bubble bath and let's enjoy the night 
 I'm that type 
 (Strawberries on top) 
 One little kiss on my lips will be 
 Enough to start it off, you will see, baby 
 Bring some strawberries and Hennessey 
 We can make love endlessly 
 (Do it baby) 
 Strawberries on top of me 
 Candlelight, a little Hennessey 
 That's the way, that's the way 
 My love flows

 Strawberries on top of me 
 Candlelight, a little Hennessey

 Right when my body feels 
 Good and ready 
 To satisfy your needs 
 Just when I'm 'bout to let you 
 Get inside

 Boy, you know I'll get you so high
