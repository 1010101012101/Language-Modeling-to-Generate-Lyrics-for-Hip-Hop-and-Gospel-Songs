You're through 
 It's over, it's over 
 Another one gets the boo 
 'Cause I don't want you more 
 The darker the berry the sweeter the juice 
 The deeper you dig the harder to let loose 
 You're sending me in circles 
 Supposed to be a real neighbor let's figure big 
 So you did what you did 
 And now you're through 
 You get the boo 
 It's over for you 
 It's over, it's over 
 Another one gets the boo 
 It's half past the monkey and where have you been 
 It's sending me to think that you could be true 
 Cause on a average a man's got to have it 
 Dog you by nature or do you by habit 
 And that's ok 'cause I'm stronger than that 
 You get the boo, you're dealing with a mac 
 I don't want you anymore 
 You did what you did and it's over 
 You can make 'em bend, I don't care, I don't care 
 Think twice before you step 
 You're through, you've been played too 
 And now you get the boo 
 It's over, it's over 
 Another one gets the boo 
 You're through 
 I ain't got no time to play games, no 
 You used to be my man but things change 
 Seeding to the gang trying to rearrange 
 You go, you go, 'cause I don't you no more 
 See, I don't think you understand what it means to be my man 
 It takes more money to impress me 
 Once you use me you lose me and you've lost 
 You're playing with a winner and I'm the boss 
 Ha ha, now, why you play yourself like that? 
 Had some good and you lost it 
 Playing with a winner, see 
 Another one gets the boo 
 It's over for you baby 
 You're being played too and now you get the boo 
 It's over, it's over 
 Another one gets the boo 
 You're through 
 No more playing games
