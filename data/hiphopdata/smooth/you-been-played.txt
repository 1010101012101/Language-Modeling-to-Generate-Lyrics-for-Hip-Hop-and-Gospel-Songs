You know it, you know it 
 It's real funny though cause you thought you was getting me 
 All the while you was being eyed 
 Get out my face, get out my face 
 It's going down y'all 
 You been played and I think you know it 
 You're too large to even try and show it 
 When I used you I used you as a steppin' stone 
 And when I was through I sent your sorry butt home 
 I was calling, begging for the third legging 
 But truthfully, Smooth was only playing 
 I was on my mental was how that I could do thee 
 But now you jock so hard baby that you play the groupie 
 You know it, you know it 
 You know that you've been played 
 Get out my face, get out my face 
 See, you know I was your friend all of a sudden 
 But when you stopped doing, baby, you didn't make nothing 
 You see, that was the beginning 
 I'm young, but baby I'm a tender 
 My game is fresh I know what you don't remember 
 You thinking you can get but ya gotten 
 From the get go Smooth was already out plotting 
 So think twice before ya step 
 The way that I'mma come here is for my due respect 
 And you can't stop me (Naw he can't stop me) 
 I'm looking at my clock and I slowly see you clocking me 
 When I was in the womb of mom before the birth of me 
 I never aggravated or kicked, I was a smooth baby 
 So feel the wrath of Smooth as I start slashing 
 No need for compassion, in a psychological fashion 
 I beat ya for your mind and not for your money 
 And now it's coming quick and baby looking kinda funny 
 People are ya ready? 
 People are ya ready? 
 Here's a clue, baby 
 I smooth played you 
 You know it, you know it 
 You know that you've been played 
 Get out my face, get out my face 
 Another notch to the scenario, the story get's deeper 
 But pay your mind for a smooth unorthodox creeper 
 I had a tip 
 A tip of the one 
 And now you sprung 
 On the smooth vocally 'cause I'm the one 
 You thought that you could get but baby now that you've been gotten 
 From the get go Smooth was only out for plotting 
 So skibby scram hot damn cause you can't understand 
 That you've been played 
 When I was in the womb of mom before the birth of me 
 I never aggravated or kicked, I was a smooth baby 
 So feel the wrath of Smooth as I start slashing 
 No need for compassion in a psychological fashion 
 Not taking for the money 
 Taking for ya mind and now the stuff's kinda funny 
 People are ya ready? 
 People are ya ready? 
 Here's a clue 
 Baby, I smooth played you 
 You know it, you know it 
 You know that you've been played 
 Get out my face, get out my face 
 You can't figure out what's on my mind 
 I don't need you, no 
 I told you 
 But you wouldn't listen 
 See you know um, it's not easy to play a player baby 
 So you can't play me 
 Let me tell you um 
 'Cause I'm the ruler 
 Sipping on my beach...
