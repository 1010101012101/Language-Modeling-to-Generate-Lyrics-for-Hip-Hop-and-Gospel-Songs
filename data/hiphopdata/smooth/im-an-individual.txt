I'm an individual 
 I'm an individual like no one else 
 I follow only one and that's myself 
 When I was a child I was independent 
 Looking for nice in the one I'm defended 
 I had a friend, I had a family and that's where it ends 
 The tip of the tip that dough 
 Making more than you'll ever know 
 In life it doesn't where you start 
 It's where you finish and what's in your heart 
 You can express it how you want 
 If it's true or if you wanna front 
 Just do what you want 
 Whether from the East or the West 
 Just be yourself and confess 
 You can do what you do and go where you go 
 Just be an individual 
 I'm an individual 
 To be an individual you gotta be different 
 Can't be smoking, can't be sniffing 
 But be yourself not a copy 
 Can't be well dressed, trendy or sloppy 
 You can like Hip hop, New Jack or Jazz 
 Whatever it is that make you laugh 
 It doesn't matter what you like 
 Just be yourself and just stay high 
 Stay up on it, stay intact 
 Act accordingly, I do, I rap 
 Divide and conquer is the goal 
 Make money, go platinum, yo go go 
 I teach, I reach in my peak 
 And everybody knows that Smooth's not weak 
 I'm unique, that's how I go 
 Cause Smooth's an individual 
 I'm an individual
