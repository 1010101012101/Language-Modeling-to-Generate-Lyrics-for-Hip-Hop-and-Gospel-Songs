Lovin' you is simple 
 Leavin' you I gotta do 
 Lovin' you is simple 
 To be with you I just want to 
 The best years in my life I gave 
 Keepin' playin' those silly games 
 But now I need a new start 
 No more trips on my heart 
 The problem began that day when you hit me 
 I shoulda run away but I didn't 
 I hope you understand 
 I gotta go, I'm lookin' for a new man 
 Lovin' you is simple 
 Leavin' you I gotta do 
 Lovin' you is simple 
 To be with you I just want to 
 A girl's gotta to what a girl's gotta do 
 A girl's gotta to what a girl's gotta do 
 A girl's gotta to what a girl's gotta do 
 Ooh wee baby, why you wanna do the things you do to me? 
 What all the mix up, the boy you fool, with all that I'm fooled 
 So, I'm saying bye bye to you 
 Never wanna be touched again and be your love makin' friend 
 No forgive and forget 
 But aw, here comes another hit 
 Why you wanna do the things you do to me? 
 All those I know who do pursue this groove aren't real 
 And if you are then I warned you 
 So therefore baby I'm changing my plans 
 I'm looking for a new man 
 Lovin' you is simple 
 Leavin' you I gotta do 
 Lovin' you is simple 
 To be with you I just want to 
 A girl's gotta to what a girl's gotta do 
 I'm sayin' bye bye to you 
 I'm sayin' bye bye 
 You can't do these things you do to me 
 Hit me kiss me and now I'm dismissing thee 
 You thought that you had game 
 But I saw you standin' in the rain 
 Whutup, what's her name, Kim? 
 Oh, you fell for that same game 
 So therefore baby I'm changing my plan 
 The best years in my life I gave 
 Keepin' playin' those silly games 
 But now I need a new start 
 A new love, a new heart 
 The problems begin that day when you hit me 
 I shoulda run away but I didn't 
 I hope you understand 
 I gotta go, I'm lookin' for a new man 
 Lovin' you is simple 
 Leavin' you I gotta do 
 Lovin' you is simple 
 Why you do the things you do to me? 
 To be with you I just want to 
 A girl's gotta to what a girl's gotta do 
 I'm sayin' bye bye 
 I'm sayin' bye bye to you 
 See you later, baby 
 I gotta go, I gotta go 
 So um, hurry, hurry, catch me if you can 
 I'm lookin' for a new man 
 So um, hurry, hurry, catch me if you can 
 I'm lookin' for a new man 
 I'm sayin' bye bye 
 A girl's gotta to what a girl's gotta do 
 I'm sayin' bye bye to you 
 See you later, baby 
 I'm lookin' for a new man 
 Why you do the things that you do to me?
