You keep trying to get inside my 
 Do you want to come with me 
 Spread a blanket on the beach 
 Drink Bachardi, have some wine 
 Let me wine and dine you 
 I'm your woman you're my man 
 If our love's real it will stand 
 Love me tender, love me now 
 You keep trying to get inside my 
 You keep trying to come inside 
 I can feel what you feel 
 Deep in you I know it's real 
 Every touch and every world 
 Tingles like a hummingbird 
 Now that I've found what's true 
 I would never leave you 
 Mister, mister you're so fine 
 Can't believe you blew my mind 
 If I left him solved the track 
 Baby, yes, I'll take you back 
 I won't rush I take it slow 
 Promise never ever go 
 Baby, please, be there for me 
 Now that I let you inside 
 You keep trying to get inside my 
 You just wanna come inside 
 You just wanna get inside 
 Baby, I want you to come inside 
 Ooh yeah 
 Now that I let you inside 
 I need for you to do the things that I need done 
 I'll do what you need done too 
 Baby, just love me 
 You keep trying to get inside my 
 You just wanna come inside 
 You just wanna get inside 
 Please don't go 
 You keep trying to get inside my 
 You just wanna come inside 
 You wanna come inside 
 You keep trying to get inside my
