This is for the suckers out there who think they want some 
 Pull up a chair and you can have some of this 
 Before you get down I make you kiss and then 
 You won't be dismissed 
 So pop up the wine should I say tone 
 This is Smooth on the microphone 
 I am the queen or should I say superior 
 I make all them Cesar rhymes feel a little bit leerier 
 No, I'm not a biter, no I'm not a sucker 
 And if you think I am, I think you better pucker up and kiss 
 The parching of a miss, all you suckers, you'll be first on my list 
 'Cause I'm a different type of girl 
 I play a different type of game 
 The title of queen I will maintain 
 And when I get done you'll be screaming my name 
 Because I always come strapped not with the gat but with a mike 
 Because I got it like that 
 My mike is like a gun I get the first shot 
 One down, now where's the next shot 
 'Cause I could be a feen when I go for the mike 
 But oh no, I break it down and I do it so right 
 I just go with the flow 
 Some a load, I took the mike and go 
 It's like a drug and you know it's like a river that's flowing 
 Continually going, hypnotizing and steadily knowing 
 Yeah, I do it for fun, I never run 
 Think twice before you say you want some 
 How many I feel will it take to stop me, to rock me 
 How many really feel they can top me 
 Especially when I'm feening, no not dreaming 
 I got the crowds so loudly screaming 
 One on one, won't be no double teaming 
 You get picture to what I'm meaning 
 I'm a bad girl, no I'm not innocent 
 Once with the mike I never finish it 
 I just replenish it and then diminish it 
 I keep on going until I want more then 
 Oh really do you wanna be my toy 
 It doesn't matter whether girl or boy 
 It doesn't matter your age sex or creed 
 'Cause when I'm on the mike I make all suckers bleed 
 Start to bleed 'cause I'm smooth in the lead 
 And if your smart go head 
 Go ahead get busy 
 I'm a Uzi you're the bullet 
 The trigger, you just pulled it 
 You're all around just talking a drag 
 Talk about my mike and wishing wish could grab 
 But oh no, you better think again 
 I'm on a mike so tell all your friends 
 I will flow and never end 
 And all you suckers go ahead and grab your pen 
 You'll get whipped slipped and dipped when I'm doing it 
 I'm not whack old fashioned, kinda new into it 
 It's not whack yo, you think that? 
 Well, it's dope and you know that 
 I'm MC Smooth, I let you aggravate 
 I let you go until I want to terminate 
 And then like the heat you will disintegrate 
 And you'll be next, sucker, if you start to perpetrate 
 'Cause I'm Smooth as a snake when it rattles 
 And I'm here never fearing a battle 
 Yeah, I do it for fun 
 So think twice before you say you want some
