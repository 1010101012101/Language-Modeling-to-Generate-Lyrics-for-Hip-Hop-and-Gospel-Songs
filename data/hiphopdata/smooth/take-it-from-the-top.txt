Take it from the top 
 One two 
 Take it from the top cause that's where I'm at 
 I'm climbing the ladder in rap 
 I'm qualified to be crowned 
 Take it from the top and not from the ground 
 Now that the queen is found I move nonstop 
 Poetically speaking I'm dope 
 A funking fresh lyric I quote 
 I'm dramatic, I don't want no static 
 And all you suckers know Smooth ain't havin' it 
 I'm real, I'm quite like life 
 And everything I feel I never feel no strife 
 Oh yes, I'm so in control 
 When I speak I just go so bold 
 I speak clear so that you can hear 
 I'm the queen of the year 
 Yo, take it from the top 
 Yo, take it from the top 
 Yo, take it from the top 
 Yo, take it from the top 
 I'm on a level and I won't go under 
 'Cause I'm smooth as lightning and thunder 
 I'm a poetical genius 
 The things that I think of all unbelievable, so deceivable then they're relievable 
 Off the gate, down the stretch I come 
 The head off the bad because I'm never won 
 A winner and not a beginner 
 Take it to the top 
 Yo, take it from the top 
 Yo, take it from the top 
 Yo, take it from the top 
 I'm equipped with power 
 I devour anyone messing with my mike known as a tower 
 It's speed what you need to make you bleed 
 And now I will lead you as my fantasy crew 
 Take it from the top from me to you 
 My name, not the first in the alphabet 
 But I won't let you come before me 
 Yo, take it from the top 
 Yo, take it from the top 
 Yo, take it from the top 
 Yo, take it from the top
