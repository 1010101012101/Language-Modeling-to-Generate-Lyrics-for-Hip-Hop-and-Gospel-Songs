Way back when 
 Way back when 
 Way back when 
 I remember when we first met 
 And we were just friends and I could be myself 
 Reminiscin' all the way back when you never asked questions 
 Just got buck wild and had love sessions 
 You were the only I knew who had a clue 
 And accepted every part and never disrespected 
 Never raised your voice, now be constantly checkin' 
 When I became your woman our friendship got neglected 
 You're not the same man I selected 
 No longer feel connected, I feel rejected 
 You used to take me out to eat, treat me extra sweet 
 Now you change your plans, week after week 
 I need a man, who can understand 
 All the things I'm going through 
 The ups and downs, I'm often doing what I do 
 Love me at my worst, love me at my best 
 Never afraid that he'll get played 
 Way back when (When everything was alright) 
 Way back when (You used to freak it to me all night) 
 Way back when (Doin' damage on my bedroom floor) 
 Way back when (Beggin' for more) 
 Way back when (Dedicatin' songs on the radio) 
 Way back when (Spend forty-four a bottle on your favorite cologne) 
 Way back when (Sportin' hickies on my neck) 
 Way back when (Get the evil eye to keep the hoochies in check) 
 Said I was your homie and your one and only 
 Promise that you'll never me lonely, that's phony 
 Now this is what I'm tryin' to get across 
 The things that made us special, all the things that we lost 
 Strollin' in the beach, whisper in my ear 
 Tellin' me what I wanna hear 
 Now inside, you sendin' me in circles 
 Round and round, now what happened to the common ground 
 And the man I thought I've found 
 When your boys wanted to hang I could always come around 
 You would rush to my house after work 
 Now you hangin' out late at night chasin' skirt and I'm hurt 
 It's drivin' me insane 
 I can't play these silly games 
 Man, you know you've changed 
 Now work the tings to you and I know 
 I'm lookin' at the front door 
 Way back when (Knockin' boot until' the break of dawn) 
 Way back when (Fallin' asleep with the TV on) 
 Way back when (Lots of presents on your birthday) 
 Way back when (Used to hit the movies every Thursday) 
 Way back when (Sneakin' around on the down low) 
 Way back when (Undercover lover so they don't know) 
 Way back when (Bumpin' beats in the jeep) 
 Way back when (You know the way we used to creep way back when) 
 One day 
 One day you will see, what you had in me 
 Wait and see, what you had in me 
 One day 
 One day you will see, what you had in me 
 Wait and see, what you had in me 
 You will see, baby 
 There's a man out there for me, for me 
 Yeah, now listen up ladies 
 You need a man who can understand 
 All the things you're goin' through 
 The ups and downs and doin' what you gotta do 
 Love you at your worst and love you at your best 
 Be there through thick and thin and stand through every test 
 Way back when (When everything was alright) 
 Way back when (You used to freak it to me all night) 
 Way back when (Doin' damage on my bedroom floor) 
 Way back when (Beggin' for more) 
 Way back when (Dedicatin' songs on the radio) 
 Way back when (Spend forty-four a bottle on your favorite cologne) 
 Way back when (Sportin' hickies on my neck) 
 Way back when (Get a evil eye to keep the hoochies in check) 
 Way back when (A simple shoulder to cry on) 
 Way back when (Got hell of bills on the telephone) 
 Way back when (Ain't got no money but the lovin's on) 
 Way back when (Always pack your bags but you're never gone) 
 Way back when (Sneakin' around on the down low) 
 Way back when (Undercover lover so they don't know) 
 Way back when (Bumpin' the beats in the jeep) 
 Way back when (You know the way we used to creep way back when) 
 One day (Way back when) 
 One day you will see, what you had in me (Way back when) 
 Wait and see, what you had in me (Way back when) 
 One day (Way back when) 
 One day you will see, what you had in me (Way back when) 
 Wait and see, what you had in me (Way back when) 
 Way back when (When everything was alright) 
 Way back when (You used to freak it to me all night) 
 Way back when (Doin' damage on my bedroom floor) 
 Way back when (Beggin' for more) 
 Way back when (Dedicatin' songs on the radio)

 Way back when (Sportin' hickies on my neck)
