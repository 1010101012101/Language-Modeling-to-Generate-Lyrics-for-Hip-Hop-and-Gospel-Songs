What up Big Chris, what we doin'? 
 What up, Smooth 
 We gotta drop it this time, we gotta do it right 
 So I need you to hook it up 
 Alright, you know, this album is pretty fat, so you know 
 Wait, is this beat cool right here? 
 Yeah, this beat is funky 
 Sure? 
 But to make it dope enough, you know, I need you to go ahead and hit some funky stuff 
 Yeah, like that 
 Psycho Squad is in the house with '93 
 Ready or not, here she comes 
 Nod once if you're ready and twice if you're not 
 Either way it goes, I got the gift so give the props 
 With a twist of my tongue you're sprung 
 I'm taking every bit, for the cop I leave a throng 
 Swingity swing high, but you swung low 
 You're just a ho, you don't have the audacity to get next to me 
 Smooth's in the midst, you're about to get dissed 
 Smooth's schizophrenic and you're about to panic 
 Ready or not, here she comes 
 I have arosen, one of the chosen 
 Peepin' on those who are dosing 
 Are you ready for the unknown? Smooth is reborn 
 See, it is impossible to be the Smooth 
 It ain't fake, being black just puts the icing on the cake 
 There's a difference between you and I 
 I is fly, so baby, what's your alibi 
 You play the dog and you're barking up the wrong tree 
 Gots to go the whole nine 
 If you swing with me you're swinging on my words like Toussaint swinging from a tree 
 So now the power's in me 
 So before I see you I wouldn't wanna be you 
 Life belted a dead bib give a do the bo know that you're a ho 
 I gotta let you know, here I come ready or not 
 Ready or not, here she comes 
 I was born a ruler so won't let me rule 
 Teaching all the listeners so won't let me school 
 You can run but you can't hide, no change for a slide 
 It's a battle, you wanna book a ride to a dead end 
 Smooth is stepping in, I want respect 
 Collect a check, bash and snap a neck 
 You're swinging on my words like Toussaint swinging from a tree 
 And now his power's in me 
 Ready or not, here she comes 
 Yeah, well, this is the Smooth
