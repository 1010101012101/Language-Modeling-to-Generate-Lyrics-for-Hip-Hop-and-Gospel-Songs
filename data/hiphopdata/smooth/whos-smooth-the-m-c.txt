I need the best female M.C. 
 I don't have anybody in mind 
 But wait, oh, Smooth the M.C. 
 Who's Smooth the M.C. 
 Everyone's searching for something new 
 But it's ending because there's few 
 Most are the same 
 Some try to change 
 And now they're asking my name? 
 How should I go, what should I say 
 Hi, I'm Smooth from L.A.? 
 If I go that way, mostly away 
 But oh yo, you say it's OK? 
 Who's Smooth the M.C. 
 Who's Smooth the M.C. 
 Who's Smooth the M.C. 
 Who is she? 
 Smooth's the most from cost the cost 
 No need to boast I change now my later 
 To prove my name alone must be a quainter 
 I'm brighter than anyone you've seen before 
 I rock the floor 
 You need more? 
 To answer the questions you asked 
 And times keep passing by you 
 I don't lie to my fans 
 No plans to keep you going to owing my time 
 You blind your mind 
 You can't find 
 Let me remind you 
 Here's a clue 
 I'm the best, no less, not test 
 So fast up to the truth it's the lead 
 But I keep searching and looking 
 Approaching for lyrices 
 I'm cooking up 
 Oh yes, it's me 
 So, no longer ask 
 Who's Smooth the M.C. 
 Who's Smooth the M.C. 
 Who's Smooth the M.C. 
 Who's Smooth the M.C. 
 Who is she? 
 Bottoms up 
 Listen to this 
 Because I'm sure 
 You don't wanna miss 
 Tristar, meaning it's three of me 
 Me, myself and I, too fly 
 I'm pleased to be a female in society 
 Realistically the first to burst to cast a curse on thee 
 Can you attain my theory 
 Now I'm in demand to command a soul 
 All will understand 
 It takes more than one to put you on this together 
 It's no illusion of any sort 
 Without support at any court 
 I try to do this for you 
 It may seem easy but it's hard to do 
 So I take out the time to make it come out right 
 No matter if I'm scared 
 I don't care 
 And I'm still aware of the lyrics I say 
 I keep on going because the girl don't play 
 I just like to say a rhyme daily 
 I keep on coming as long as I get paid 
 A sucker gets laid when I'm saying my rhymes 
 I make 'em come out still on time 
 'Cause I flow so easily 
 And I'm Smooth 
 And everybody knows that I rule 
 I'm the queen of rap 
 What else should I say 
 I keep on coming 
 I do it everyday 
 The girl's from L.A. 
 And like I said before 
 Listen closely as I do some more 
 They call me the Smooth 
 My man is J 
 Everybody's dropping the dopeness this way 
 My brother Chris popped up the demo 
 Now I'm rollin' a fresh Benz limo 
 Yo, Smooth, get off the mike and let somebody else grab that 
 Yeah Smooth, come on 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute 
 The mike is mine 
 Come on, get on up off there 
 Sometimes I think I feel crazy 
 When I move the mike I never feel lazy 
 I pick up the mike and start the flow again 
 I keep on going till the beat ends 
 I'm going till you know who I am 
 Damn, what happened to the beat?
