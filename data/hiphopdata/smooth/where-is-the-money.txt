Pump it up y'all 
 What's up guys it's time to get paid again 
 Driving fly cars but where is the money when I wanna smile 
 I have a nice smile but meanwhile your lies are in a bowl 
 Time to get paid again 
 You promised me cash and to have a nice handle plan 
 But when I asked you when you never understand it's hard 
 And you seem to think it's funny 
 But I still ask where is the money 
 Just realize the money is the move 
 You keep promising but you can't slick this move 
 I wanna get paid where's the persuade 
 Go to Jamaica and lay in the shade 
 Stop and call it a day 
 You promised it but it's the opposite 
 'Cause you're a fake, instead of a Benz 
 You imitate cause all of your cash I will take 
 Where is the money 
 Pump it up y'all 
 I once knew a guy Money Mon was his name 
 He thought he was cute but he was really insane 
 Promising cash and all sorts of jewels 
 And I fell for it just like boo boo the fool 
 I went to his house, no it was shack 
 He said he had a Benz and a Cadillac 
 But it was lies cause it was nothing like that 
 He is a bum out for fun 
 I asked him why they called him Money Mon 
 Yo, he thought it was funny 
 But I still said where is the money 
 It's another guy, dude he is really a fool 
 Benz one day a Pinto the next 
 Always out there just ready to catch 
 Pull you along with a big fantasy 
 But he was broke and you couldn't really tell 
 'Cause I was broke 
 Where is the money 
 Pump it up y'all 
 I got to have Gucci list label on 
 MCM and I even want more 
 I got to have some cash in my pocket you know 
 Cruise down the Star, put on a big show 
 Gucci, yeah LA yeah, I got to step off fly in the atmosphere 
 I know the best things in life are supposed to be free 
 Well, all the free money, you can give it to me 
 But no, you think it's funny when I have to ask where is the money 
 Where is the money 
 Pump it up y'all 
 Cruise to Aruba in my new yacht 
 I wear my lindress 
 And I just gotta got Swiss accounts all over the world 
 'Cause I'm know as a jet set girl 
 So before you wanna talk to me 
 You gotta have funds to get the best of me 
 You shouldn't have asked me why for MONEY 
 'Cause if you do Smooth won't be with you 
 I like find a guy with money when I get me a honey 
 I wanna get paid cold cash 
 Where is the money 
 Pump it up y'all
