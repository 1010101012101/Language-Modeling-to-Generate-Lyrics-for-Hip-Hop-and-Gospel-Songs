What's up, baby? 
 What you talkin' about 
 Yeah, you 
 It's been a long time, you know what I'm sayin' 
 Yes, it has 
 Why you wanna try to do this now 
 'Cause I've been waitin' for you, you know 
 Don't wait, don't wait, baby 
 'Cause, I'ma make it right for you 
 It's all good, now 
 I'ma make it right 
 I'ma make it good 
 Right now 
 You ain't gon' understand what I'm doin' to you 
 Oh, what you gonna do next? 
 It's been a while since we got buck wild doin' it ghetto style 
 I remember the way we used to play like it was yesterday 
 Your lips give sweet memories of you and me 
 Backseat of my Jeep 
 You make me weak between the sheets 
 And I don't see nothing wrong with us gettin' it on (get it on, baby) 
 Word is bond 
 Do you wanna bone until the early morn' 
 Once again I need a taste of the ghetto 
 Movin' it nice and slow 
 Will you please be mine, baby, one more time, yeah 
 It's just the things you do 
 When you're groovin', and movin' ghetto style 
 Cause you love me ghetto style, yeah 
 No one else can compare 
 Just keep it right there movin' ghetto style 
 Cause you love me ghetto style 
 Ooh, boy, I miss you so 
 Never ever ever ever should have let you go 
 Once again I get back with you 
 The things I'll do 
 Please take me back, back (your lovin') 
 Your love is right on track 
 Your tongue got me sprung 
 I know you're the one 
 Those bedroom eyes make me fantasize 
 It's no surprise (ghetto style) 
 Now I'm hypnotized, spread my thighs and come inside 
 A little care and affection 
 It's time for one more freak session 
 Send a chill up and down my spine 
 For one night be mine 
 It's just the things you do 
 When you're groovin', and movin' ghetto style 
 Cause you love me ghetto style, yeah 
 No one else can compare 
 Just keep it right there movin' ghetto style 
 Cause you love me ghetto style 
 'Cause I'm a mack 
 And I get real freaky 
 Turn down my lights 
 Let me freak you right 
 A little moan and groan 
 Don't make me start freaking with your mind 
 No tellin' what you'll find 
 'Cause I know I'll blow your mind 
 Let's just do it one more time 
 Let me ride, let me ride, let me ride 
 And baby, when you're down come inside 
 No, no, no, no, we gotta wear a condom, baby 
 Cause that's the only way I'm freakin' 
 Get me strapped when you freak the back 
 That's the way I ride my track 
 'Cause I'm a mack (cause you love me ghetto style) 
 And I get real freaky, yeah
