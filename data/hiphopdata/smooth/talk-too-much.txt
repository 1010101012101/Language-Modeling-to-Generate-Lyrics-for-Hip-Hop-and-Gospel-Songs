As long as you're talking and I be the topic 
 I tell you, you'll tell it as quickly as I drop it 
 You talk too much 
 As quickly as I drop it 
 You talk too much 
 As long as you're talking and I be the topic 
 I tell you, you to tell it as quickly as I drop it 
 Twisted like lyin' cause you don't know the truth 
 Steadily concerned in with you I'm knocking boots 
 If I told you turd is you flip it to another 
 No wonder that the truth won't take you under 
 People want to say what they say when they say 
 So I let 'em say it anyway 
 As long as you're talking and I be the topic 
 I tell you, you'll tell it as quickly as I drop it 
 You talk too much 
 As long as you're talking and I be the topic 
 I tell you, you'll tell it as quickly as I drop it 
 You talk too much 
 You said I had a dream, well, maybe I did 
 You said I smoked a blunt, well, maybe that I'm with 
 What you don't see you don't know 
 You listen to the rumors and you better slow your go 
 Gobble the chit, the chit chatter, that's the jibber jabber 
 'Cause you're going for a back stabber 
 All the talking you're doing 
 Now that I'm coming up you try to change it 
 A daily feud with the playing you're doing 
 People always say this and that about a woman like me 
 I don't get upset or get weggie 
 'Cause I know the game and the game is wicked 
 I heard it all before and the talk is cheapest 
 Smooth only knows what Smooth only knows 
 And I never and I never pump a lie cause that's how it goes 
 As long as you're talking and I be the topic 
 I tell you, you'll tell it as quickly as I drop it 
 You talk too much 
 As long as you're talking and I be the topic 
 I tell you, you'll tell it as quickly as I drop it 
 You talk too much 
 As long as you're talking and I be the topic 
 You drop it 
 You talk too much 
 As long as you're talking and I be the topic 
 I tell you, you tell it as quickly as I drop it 
 You talk too much 
 Who knows the truth about you 
 The liars don't have a clue 
 When I get vexed and I'm next to test the victim 
 I picked one and it's you 
 So you better run before you speak of me, dumb dumb 
 Now that I'm coming up you try to change it 
 Daily feudin' with the playing you're doing 
 People want to say this and that about a woman like me 
 I don't get upset or get weggie 
 'Cause I know the game and the game is weak 
 I heard it all before and the talk is cheap 
 People wanna say what they when they say 
 So I let 'em say it anyway 
 As long as you're talking and I be the topic 
 I tell you, you tell it as quickly as I drop it 
 You talk too much 
 As long as you're talking and I be the topic 
 I tell you, you tell it as quickly as I drop it 
 You talk too much 
 You telling a lie as quickly as I drop it 
 As long as you're talking and I be the topic 
 I tell you, you tell it as quickly as I drop it 
 You talk too much 
 As long as you're talking and I be the topic 
 I tell you, you tell it as quickly as I drop it 
 You talk too much 
 Every time it's time for you to shut up 
 Cause you talk just a little too much for me 
 You talk just a little too much, yeah 
 As soon as I drop it you're talking 
 And don't know what you're talking about 
 All into Kool-aid and don't know the flavor 
 Dang, you talk too much I'm outta here 
 Nope
