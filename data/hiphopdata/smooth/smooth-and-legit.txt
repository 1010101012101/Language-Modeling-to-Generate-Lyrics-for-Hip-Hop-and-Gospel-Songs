Sometimes all it takes is a sip of my ware 
 To make me pick up my pen and then my mind gets wet 
 And then I inject the rhymes that it selects 
 So you're under attack because I work it 
 Some say I wear jewels when my mind gets lose 
 With the rhymes I produce 
 But I will induce pains 
 The lip remains the same 
 Smooth the name 
 I'm a VIP with a MBA 
 Money write it a tool 
 The body I will include 
 Or shall I exclude that I will sue 
 But now we're proof that I am Smooth 
 So give attention when it's deserved 
 So when I get old my rhymes you could preserve 
 I like candy 
 So sweet I taste 
 Mouth water if we no time to waste 
 I never pick acceded but I knew it was up 
 5'3 built to a T 
 Ain't this for reality 
 The best in actuality 
 So, get off my tip 'cause I'm Smooth and definitely legit 
 I ain't havin' it 
 'Cause I'm Smooth and definitely legit 
 Yo it doesn't matter if I scatter 
 I serve my rhymes on a silver platter 
 Some sit down and listen closely 
 As I again start to proceed 
 But then mostly I plan proceed 
 'Cause I'm the S the M double O T to the H, see 
 Would it pick the new strategy, yeah 
 I weigh one forty but that's not much 
 'Cause it's pound for pound but then punch for punch 
 The tip I'm on, yeah it's smooth 
 Now I'm on and I'm ready to prove 
 The time I invest, it won't be blessed 
 'Cause I pray every night but then I press request 
 I'm not from the east but I am from the west, the est 
 Plus my J, yeah I'm strong and I'm on my way 
 So yo, get off my tip 'cause I'm Smooth and definitely legit 
 I ain't havin' it 
 'Cause I'm Smooth and definitely legit 
 I never rap 'bout a man, I got my own 
 And him I do own and that is prone 
 I state that clearly on the MIC phone 
 Yeah the mike you will smoke it like a pipe 
 And when I'm done, you know I'm not quite through 
 But true, I thought you knew 
 That the rhyme was mine 
 Just like the time is mine 
 And when I'm on the mike, yeah, it's all divine 
 Until you find that it'll all combine new jacks 
 I'm gonna play with your minds 
 'Cause you're a new jack, you lack to be exact 
 You just react to the crowd, yeah, the pack 
 When I'm on stage, believe that 
 If your head aches Smooth will relieve that 
 Well are you pissed, well, come get some of this 
 So you could get dissed 
 And like I said I don't miss 
 'Cause I'm crisp like a dollar bill 
 Oh yeah a meal, more feel as I do 
 And it's still 'cause I'm BAD 
 Yeah that's me, I'm just as bad as I could be 
 But I'm mostly sexy when I'm built to a T 
 'Cause I'm Smooth an equipped beauty 
 Now I'm not picky, are you ready for a quicky 
 A battle, no it won't be quick 
 Cause after this you'll all be on a diss tip 
 So what, do you want some of this 
 'Cause I'm a telling you exactly where to find me 
 I'm the queen of 1990 
 My rhymes are clear but all surprised 
 Because I'm taking charge, living large 
 So don't boast on my time when I start to motivate 
 And on your mind, yeah, I think I demonstrate 
 'Cause I could be a teacher or like a preacher 
 Sit on down as I start to deceit you 
 Cause your mind's equipped for one thing 
 But not for the dope rhymes Smooth sings 
 So, yo, get off my tip 'cause I'm Smooth and definitely legit 
 I ain't havin' it 
 'Cause I'm Smooth and definitely legit
