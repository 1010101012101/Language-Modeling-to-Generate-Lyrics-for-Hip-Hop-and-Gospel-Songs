A black man, that not too many understand 
 Pyt, playa young thug, you need some lovin' tlc 
 I wanna get with you 
 (Smooth) 
 It's Saturday, time to play 
 I gotta hit the street, I'm chillin' out ok 
 I gotta hit the spot lookin' fl 
 I wanna watch the O.G. thugs roll by 
 Find a little lovin', not too much 
 Just enough to wake them up 
 Who do I see, a fool that wanna get with me 
 Not in the mood, so I really don't wanna speak 
 A black man, that not too many understand 
 He has a plan, not to work for uncle sam 
 A hood fanatic, a hoodlum mack 
 In fact, the male version of a female mack 
 He has money and everything that comes with it 
 Pyt, playa young thug 
 Just a tiny bit of what the ghettos made of 
 Gotta give love to the young thugs 
 A black man, that not too many understand 
 Pyt, playa young thug, you need some lovin' tlc 
 I wanna get with you 
 A black man, that not too many understand 
 Pyt, playa young thug, you need some lovin' tlc 
 I wanna get with you

 Look here 
 Now tell me whos afraid of this young Thug 
 Look how we came up from the ghetto were we slung drugs 
 America eats it's babies, it's crazy 
 Will somebody save me from this sytematic slavery 
 Got me in cuffs, I'm gettin' ruffed up daily 
 Send me to jail 'cause I rebel on what they tell me 
 My life's hell, got the law tryin' to capture me 
 And then the courts and the whole force after me 
 I'm hittin fences, my defenses, it was senseless 
 It's like the whole was against us 
 Then they wonder why I'm cussin, bustin' at the world 
 Don't trust em, me and my homies sayin' fuck em 
 Rollin' in my 6-0 Impala, all about makin' dollars 
 Sometimes it make me wanna holla 
 But now its cool, and if I'm motivatin, baby make a move 
 Cause uh, thugs get lonely too 
 And all I heard 'em say was... 
 A black man, that not too many understand 
 Pyt, playa young thug, you need some lovin' tlc 
 I wanna get with you 
 A black man, that not too many understand 
 Pyt, playa young thug, you need some lovin' tlc 
 I wanna get with you 
 (Smooth) 
 A straight up menace 
 And if he starts then he will finish to keep his image 
 And I can tell, bye the way he bail, he was paid well 
 Talkin' dinner, movies and the motel 
 Sexual, flexible, he gets freaky undercovers, so he's good to go 
 I only know what I see in the hood is thugs 
 So you know I gotta give them love 
 A black man, that not too many understand 
 Pyt, playa young thug, you need some lovin' tlc 
 I wanna get with you 
 A black man, that not too many understand 
 Pyt, playa young thug, you need some lovin' tlc 
 I wanna get with you 
 He got money and everything that comes with it, pyt 
 Just a little part of what the ghettos made of 
 Gotta give love to the young thugs 
 A black man, that not too many understand 
 Pyt, playa young thug, you need some lovin' tlc 
 I wanna get with you 
 A black man, that not too many understand 
 Pyt, playa young thug, you need some lovin' tlc 
 I wanna get with you 
 A black man, that not too many understand 
 Pyt, playa young thug, you need some lovin' tlc 
 I wanna get with you
