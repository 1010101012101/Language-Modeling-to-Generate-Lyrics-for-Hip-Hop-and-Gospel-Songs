How many times have you heard this 
 What's the former one 
 How many times have you heard this 
 Smooth is the name, so baby let me be worth this 
 You love that nigga faking funk around the others? 
 No one who wants to believed that you be all up on a brother 
 Paging number one and blowing up it's going 108 beep 
 Once you leave the room check the speech 
 Just a new thing 
 I thought you knew then 
 Back it up and let the female take a swing 
 I'm taking a step for someone to quote 
 Claiming at your broke pop pop, nigga, ain't a show 
 Save the drama for next on the list 
 I'm taking a step for someone to quote 
 Claiming at your broke pop pop, nigga, ain't a show 
 Save the drama for next on the list 
 I wanna know how many times have you heard this 
 Hey you, I don't believe in silly games 
 How many times have you heard this 
 The story gets deeper, yeah 
 How many times have you heard this 
 Only down myself is what I figure 
 Trust no one is what busts every nigga 
 Finger down deep holding on my Glock 
 Gots to get wet again, I'm starting to feel hot 
 Sparkling extra clear, still ready to go 
 And no it's time for Smooth to catch a flow 
 It gets harder and harder as days go by 
 Still super fly but goddamn this one man makes me cry 
 Hey you, I don't believe in silly games 
 Save the drama for next on the list 
 How many times have you heard this 
 How many times 
 Save the drama for next on the list 
 Yeah 
 How many times have you heard this 
 How many times 
 How many times have you heard this 
 It's hard to be a woman in the nineties 
 To young for the lies and the drama 
 So uhm don't let the smooth taste fool you 
 Your little rabbit tricks off I guess I gots to have it 
 The game ain't new, you're just new to the game 
 Well, many have tried and attempted 
 Ended up slipping but play a ho and let the Smooth start the pimp 
 Huh, you think you're down with this 
 I'm saying a step for someone to quote 
 Climbing at your broke pop pop, nigga, ain't a show 
 Save the drama for next on the list 
 I'm saying a step for someone to quote 
 Climbing at your broke pop pop, nigga, ain't a show 
 Save the drama for next on the list 
 I wanna know how many times have you heard this 
 I heard it all before 
 I'm hearing it again 
 Hey you, I don't believe in silly games 
 Save the drama for next on the list 
 Cause uh, Smooth ain't having it 
 How many times have you heard this
