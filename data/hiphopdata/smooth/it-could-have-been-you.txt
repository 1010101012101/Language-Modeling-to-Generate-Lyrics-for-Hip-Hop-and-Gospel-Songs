Break it down 
 I remember that day when I first met you 
 I looked at you and I knew I would get you 
 You were so cute and you made me smile 
 So I stopped for a moment it was worth my while 
 It touched my heart when you said hi 
 I was just so scared that I couldn't reply 
 I lost my mind, did not know what to say 
 Just so startled, I walked away 
 Could have been you, turn it up 
 Then I decided that I wanted to speak 
 Hoping that his heart yet I could reach 
 He wouldn't talk like I wanted him to 
 And you know that this story is true 
 I gave the opportunity 
 But he was afraid to get with me 
 Could have been you, turn it up 
 Well, as it ended it was time to go 
 He asked me for my number and then I said no 
 I tried to start it when I first got there 
 But him, he was just too scared 
 So as I got to the door and I said goodbye 
 He looked so sad that he almost cried 
 But I thought to myself, I gave him a try 
 Could have been you, turn it up
