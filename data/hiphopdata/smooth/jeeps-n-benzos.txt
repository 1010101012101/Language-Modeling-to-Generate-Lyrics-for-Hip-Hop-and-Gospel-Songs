Ridin' around in your jeeps or your Benzos 
 Ridin' around in your jeeps or your Benzos 
 Ridin' around in your jeeps or your Benzos 
 Ridin' around in your jeeps or your Benzos 
 Headed for the park, brothers shootin' hoops 
 Girlies all fly, body suits and Daisy Dukes 
 Some on the flouty, others on the endo 
 I'm checkin' for the Jeeps and the Benzos 
 For deep some a bunny's gettin' freaky 
 Some bangin', some slangin', some dealin' 
 Rollin' through the hood, checkin' G's but no killin' 
 She'll roll for a Jeep or a Benzo 
 Ridin' around in your Jeeps or your Benzos 
 Bump it in your Jeeps 
 Ridin' around in your Jeeps or your Benzos 
 Can you feel the beat 
 Ridin' around in your Jeeps or your Benzos 
 Bump it in your Jeeps and Benzos 
 Ridin' around in your Jeeps or your Benzos 
 Check out my melody as it makes you weak 
 Brother, you be rollin' in a back of Benz or Jeep 
 Drop top, standing at the bus stop, suckin' on a lollipop 
 Once they see the Benz and the ends, don't let the panties drop 
 Around the way girl fe-macsy car hop 
 Summertime come and they checkin' for drop tops 
 Sun roof-tops,  bumpin' in the back 
 Cruisin' on the scene with the gangster lean 
 Ridin' around in your jeeps or your Benzos 
 Bump it in your jeeps and Benzos 
 Ridin' around in your jeeps or your Benzos 
 Can you feel it 
 Ridin' around in your jeeps or your Benzos 
 And Benzos 
 Girls be yellin' out Smooth, because of the way I roll, yeah 
 I'm talkin' about white men spendin' much bank 
 Kickin' it with your homies, lookin' at the groupies 
 Checkin' out the fellas, the ones that wanna do me 
 Call me on my cellular, I *69 you, I'll find ya 
 Lookin' in your rear view,  I'm rollin' right behind ya 
 Eyes are low, and I'm fellin' kinda buzzed 
 Checkin' for the 50 because 
 80H ??? strictly for the macs 
 Bump it in your Jeep because it's like that 
 Ridin' around in your Jeeps or your Benzos 
 Bump it in your Jeeps 
 Ridin' around in your Jeeps or your Benzos 
 Can you feel the beat 
 Ridin' around in your Jeeps or your Benzos 
 Bump it in your Jeeps and Benzos 
 Ridin' around in your Jeeps or your Benzos 
 You're just a young stud down with the chitty-chitty bang bang 
 Can't tell her nothin' 'cause she thinks she rollin' everything 
 She'll roll for a Jeep or a Benzo 
 She's just a young stud down with the chitty-chitty bang bang 
 Can't tell her nothin' 'cause she thinks she rollin' everything 
 She'll roll for a Jeep or a Benzo 
 Ridin' around in your Jeeps or your Benzos 
 Bump it in your Jeeps 
 Ridin' around in your Jeeps or your Benzos 
 Can you feel the beat 
 Ridin' around in your Jeeps or your Benzos 
 Bump it in your Jeeps and Benzos
