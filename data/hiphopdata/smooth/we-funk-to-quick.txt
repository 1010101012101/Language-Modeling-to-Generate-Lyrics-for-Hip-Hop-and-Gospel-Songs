Turn the track up a little bit 
 We funk too quick 
 We funk too quick for me 
 We funk too quick 
 Can I confront you on that day 
 What crossed my mind as we lay 
 I know I let you in oh so willingly 
 We funk too quick 
 We funk too quick 
 I gave you my body that sacred part of me 
 I must say to you on this day 
 That we, that we funk too quick 
 We funk too quick for me 
 And now we're moving on 
 We funk too quick for me 
 I gave you my body 
 To some extent I do regret 
 The day you came into my life 
 You gave me that same old lie 
 That you won't lose respect 
 Although I know that once you hit how quickly you forget 
 We funk too quick 
 We funk too quick 
 How could my love with you be missed 
 I tell you on this day 
 That we, that we funk too quick 
 I said that, I said that, I said that, I said that 
 I said that, I said that, I said that, I said that 
 That we funk too quick for me 
 And now we're moving on and on and on 
 We funk too quick for me 
 I gave you my body 
 We funk too quick for me 
 Every little drop of love 
 And now we're moving on 
 Moving on now 
 We funk too quick for me 
 I gave you my body 
 Sometimes you think we met the right person 
 And we wanna make love and do all that 
 Don't do this shit to me, baby 
 We funk too quick for me 
 And now we're moving on 
 We funk too quick for me 
 I gave you my body
