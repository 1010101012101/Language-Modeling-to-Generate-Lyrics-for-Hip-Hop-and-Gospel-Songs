Turn that damn music down 
 Go, go, go, kick it 
 You got to be real 
 I met this guy named Tony, just too bone me he'd get with a 'rony 
 Thought I would oblige but I wouldn't 
 When he came close he knew he just couldn't get me, the F.MC 
 But back then I needed a friend, I looked at his face and then I thought again 
 Maybe he can have a chance, no 
 Kick it 
 But nah, I couldn't go that route 
 A girl like Smooth just had to doubt 
 He's not equipped for my kind 
 I mean my body, my soul and my mind 
 This guy was not quite my type 
 I looked at him and then I couldn't get hype 
 I said oh no, it's time to go home 
 You're not coming back because you can't ??? 
 Real, you got to be real 
 I knew this other guy named Rick 
 Always on the smooth trip 
 But I had to break down his ego 
 Before he got to me I had to let him go 
 Trying to bust the move I said oh no 
 He tried to give me money but I still said no 
 He was cute, I won't lie 
 I felt like giving this cute guy a try 
 But why? It wouldn't work 
 This guy was cute but he was a flirt 
 I just didn't think that it would go 
 Because a girl like Smooth is not a girl like a ho 
 I don't give it up easy 
 This little boy must have thought I was sleazy 
 Try to approach quiet 
 Nah, I didn't riot 
 Real, you got to be real 
 There was someone that I knew 
 Thought he was a winner, oh yes this is true 
 He took me to dinner at his place 
 He was moving to quick, I said this is not a race 
 I said yeah boy, I need some time 
 So I left came back and then played with the mind 
 Oh yes, later to find that's him, thought he was a Tina 
 You got to be real 
 Damn, thought he was Tina, a real life unusual ballerina 
 I said, oh no, I've been tricked 
 This guy's not really on my dip 
 He was worthless, useless with no taste 
 Acting like a woman standing in my face 
 Step off cause you gets no rap 
 Turn that damn music down 
 You ain't having it, your face was meant to be slapped 
 Who would have guessed you, I just diss you 
 Leave you crying, leave you to die 
 It's a fact that you just ain't got it 
 Oh, you're just a little too weird, too tough 
 Kind of crisscross can't understand why you act that way 
 Turn that damn music down 
 Real, kick it
