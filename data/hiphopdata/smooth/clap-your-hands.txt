Clap, clap, clap your hands, clap your hands together 
 Get that 
 This is Smooth's beat 
 This time I'ma take it on a new rock 
 My approach is to make a party people shot 
 So everybody get up and start to dance 
 Every guy, here's your chance to move your body and grab a girl 
 But remember, this is a woman's world 
 So move your body and shake your feet and remember 
 This is Smooth's beat 
 So we groove and move everybody 
 And like I say it's time to start partying 
 Start to move and start to get shaken 
 And oh, and won't be no faking 
 You're not mistaken, the voice that I'm taking out on this groove 
 I order you to move 
 Clap, clap, clap your hands, clap your hands together 
 This is Smooth's beat 
 Everybody clap your hands 
 Do you want to see me dance and get in a trance 
 Oh, I think you wanna romance 
 This beat is dope and really moving 
 When Smooth's on the mike it's so soothing 
 I get you moving and like I said I keep you grooving 
 So do what I'm doing 
 Oh yeah, that's the way I say, that's the way I play 
 Move it like and you'll feel good today 
 Oh yes, I'm getting sexy, oh no, I better stop, the police will arrest me 
 The way I move it is so funky, not the rarest monkey 
 But it's something different, a little more, oh I move on the floor 
 Clap, clap, clap your hands, clap your hands together 
 This is Smooth's beat 
 So clap your hands everybody 
 And everybody just clap your hands 
 Yo I do it nicely 
 I add a little flavor to keep it very spicy 
 I'm very classy, sometimes flashy 
 But on the dancefloor I get really nasty 
 Oh, you wanna hear some more? 
 Well, get on on the dancefloor 
 This is Smooth's beat 
 It started off nice but it's changing 
 Thoughts in your mind should be rearranging 
 I'm Talking about dancing and how it affects thee 
 DANCING is exactly what I want you to do for me 
 It's not hard it's done so easily 
 It's hip hop if it's done right 
 That's what the party people like 
 I didn't try to shock you 
 I wanted to lock you into the groove 
 You know what, I order you to move 
 Clap, clap, clap your hands, clap your hands together 
 This is Smooth's beat 
 So clap your hands everybody 
 Everybody just clap your hands 
 And clap your hands everybody 
 And no, Smooth's in demand 
 This is Smooth's beat 
 You know what I'm saying 
 This is Smooth's beat
