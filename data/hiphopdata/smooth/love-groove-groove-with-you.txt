Started off nice and slow 
 Poured the champagne, light a candle 
 Tell me what you want now that the lights are down 
 And your boys ain't around 
 I got what you're lookin' for 
 Kinda like a gangster, and there's some more 
 I'm second to none 
 The icing on the cakes, are you ready for some 
 Reminiscin' on you and I 
 Makin' love (Feelin' freakified) 
 Nothin' but the best for this princess 
 The backseat of my of jeep, is the mattress 
 Come pick me up so we can kick it 
 Then baby, maybe later on, you can lick it 
 Tonight's the night I recommend 
 That you get in where you fit in 
 Take my hand, and come with me to love land 
 'Cause all I wanna do is love groove with you (Groove with you) 
 Come get your groove on or I'll just have to move on 
 'Cause all I wanna do is love groove with you (Groove with you) 
 Close your eyes and recognize 
 I'm lookin' sexy in my thigh-high boots 
 You could be knockin', our lips lockin' 
 Instead we on the phone 'cause you wanna hear me jockin' 
 Are you feelin' what I'm feelin' inside 
 A soft and smooth, satisfying ride 
 Much better than the guys 
 I'm just around the corner so no need to fantasize 
 Your boys can't touch this 
 Tellin' you I'm no good on the side tryin' to rush this 
 Started off, nice and slow 
 Pour the champagne as I nibble 
 On your body how you squeezin' on the pillow 
 Ooh, get mental (Pleasure is the principal) 
 I got what you're lookin' for, and then some more 
 Take my hand, and come with me to love land 
 'Cause all I wanna do is love groove with you (Groove with you) 
 Come get your groove on or I'll just have to move on 
 'Cause all I wanna do is love groove with you (Groove with you) 
 Groove with you 
 Groove with you 
 Groove with you 
 Groove with you 
 What I gotta say, what I gotta do 
 Now's your last chance, baby come on through 
 Tonight's your night to make it right 
 And if you don't, then someone else might 
 Once the body starts movin' (I stop soothin') 
 Wanna see your body groovin' 
 So baby what you gonna do 
 It's all on you (Groove with you) 
 Take my hand, and come with me to love land 
 'Cause all I wanna do is love groove with you (Groove with you) 
 Come get your groove on or I'll just have to move on 
 'Cause all I wanna do is love groove with you (Groove with you) 
 Take my hand, and come with me to love land 
 'Cause all I wanna do is love groove with you (Groove with you) 
 Come get your groove on or I'll just have to move on 
 'Cause all I wanna do is love groove with you (Groove with you) 
 Groove with you 
 Groove with you 
 Groove with you 
 Groove with you
