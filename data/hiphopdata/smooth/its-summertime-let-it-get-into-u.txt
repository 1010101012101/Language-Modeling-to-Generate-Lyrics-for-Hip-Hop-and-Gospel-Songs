Hey, gotta get it, yo 
 There is nothing you can't do once you let the funk freak you 
 Call your boys and let them know Smooth, is there anyone down to follow 
 Let's all get together and have some fun 
 On the natural high 
 Now, don't be strappin' no guns 
 Leave the drama at home 
 And till the break of dawn 
 You know the party is on 
 It's on, yeah 
 Let's head to the jam 
 Let it all hang out 
 Now put your hands in the air and scream the shout 
 Let the groove in your body, then turn it out 
 It's summertime, lover time 
 Drop the tops of your cars 
 Are you ready to ride? 
 Release your soul, body and mind 
 It's all about the party 
 Leave your troubles behind 
 Put your short shorts on it's summertime 
 It's summertime, that's what it is 
 Let it get into you 
 It's summertime, that's what it is 
 Let it get into you 
 Before they get the crowd jumpin' 
 Keep the hearty pumpin' 
 All night long I wanna see you moving something 
 No roughnecking, disrespecting 
 Just all get along 
 We don't need no chin checking 
 I ain't got nothing but love for you, baby, understand 
 Doing what you gotta do is all in the plan 
 But keeping the peace when you're jamming in love land 
 Now you know, here we go 
 Let's head to the jam 
 Let it all hang out 
 And throw your hands in the air, now scream the shout 
 Let the groove in your body, then turn it out 
 It's summertime, lover time 
 It's summertime, that's what it is 
 Let it get into you 
 It's summertime, that's what it is 
 Let it get into you 
 It ain't nothing but a party, big baby 
 This summer jam got you going crazy 
 It's the fat flow when a man attracts you 
 The rhythm from the back 'cause it's on like that 
 Are you ready for anything then let you body swing 
 Come, come now, I'm down 
 Are you down to get buck wild? 
 Ooh, watch out 
 Open up and see what you can find 
 Let the rhythm freak your mind 
 It's summertime, that's what it is 
 Let it get into you 
 It's summertime, that's what it is 
 Let it get into you 
 There is nothing you can't do once you let the funk freak you 
 Call your boys and let them know Smooth, is there anyone down to flow
