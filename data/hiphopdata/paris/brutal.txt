(Paris) 
 Paris is my name, I flows with ease 
 Cash checks, breaks necks and wrecks MC's 
 Who ain't down with the sound of the Panther Movement 
 Intense is a serious answer 
 The mic goes into labor you freeze up 
 Enveloped by the style that sounds so ROUGH 
 Rehearsal weak verses potent as cyanide 
 A million and a half shot keepin' you high 
 But I don't sell 'cause what you're sellin is never sold 
 Or dealed by the REAL mack brothers of old 
 Naw, I just devise a wise new formula 
 To keep you in tune without sellin my soul 
 In 1930, it all began 
 With a movement comprised of intelligent black men 
 Led by Allah in the form of Farad 
 But later by the last true prophet of God 
 Elijah, Muhammad, a dominant black leader 
 Of The Lost/Found Asiatic Pack 
 And later by Malcolm, whose point was straight 
 Stressing a black nationalistic state 
 Of self-sufficiency on a mission he 
 Stressed thrift and pride and good sense 
 Killed in cold blood but the shit ain't done with 
 Switch to Oaktown, '66 
 See Huey Newton, and Cleveland Seale 
 Sons of Malcolm with intent to kill 
 And end the brutality inflicted on us by cops 
 Best believe I won't stop 
 Teachin science in step with Farrakhan 
 Drop a dope bomb, word to Islam 
 Keeps my brothers up on it 'cause I'm black 
 And now you know, I'm BRUTAL 
 {*Explosion*} 
 Callin all brothers to order, P-Dog'll slaughter 
 Stomp rip and choke those who thought a 
 Young black man wasn't capable of the intellect 
 Of gainin respect, without sellin so CHECK 
 I'm Paris, six feet two, deadly as ice 
 But twice as nice with, the power to fight boy 
 So listen I'm tellin' y'all, the warnin the Final Call 
 We're headin, for Armageddeon, it's like that 
 The government's policy see is tactical genocide 
 How many must die, chasin a chemical high? 
 How much, killin' and murderin mayhem more can we stand 
 Before we fold black man, so take a stand 
 Listen up drug dealer - whassup with that? 
 Hope I don't bust a cap, straight in your MOTHERFUCKIN ass 
 For pushin poison to youth, I'm through with talkin' I'm steppin up 
 With gat point blank at your motherfuckin mug 
 I'm, P-R-O, B-L-A-C-K 
 Stompin and crushin to mush, any lush, in my way 
 I'm educated and strong, always right and no wrong 
 With many bullets of a Bensonhurst, come on along 
 It's like that y'all, and I won't QUIT 
 Keepin' y'all fresh on the movement tip 
 With F.O.I. at my side, we're never slippin or nap 
 We always come sick-wid-it, bustin' serious caps 
 There's no, bullshit, and yo look, this is the danger zone 
 You shouldn't have stepped to it, you shouldn't have come alone 
 You shouldn't have ever thought, the movement was soft 
 Don't you know P-Dog'll never stop 
 I'm BRUTAL!
