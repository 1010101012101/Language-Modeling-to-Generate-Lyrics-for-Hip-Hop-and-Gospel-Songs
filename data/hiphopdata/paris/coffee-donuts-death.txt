12:15, lay real low at night 
 Creep in a jeep hit the corner tight 
 Finna to go clip they wings 
 But gotta keep it neat and clean 
 One-time [blam] make it so they momma cry 
 Y'all shoulda eased up when I told you last time 
 But now I gotta do it the hard way 
 P-A-Y-back day 
 Then we see 'em, the black and white on sixth street 
 Cut a left in the lot of Mickey D's 
 And pulled up to the window 
 Ssshhh! Big Yon creeped on him real slow 
 He could see when he looked at me 
 That a brother wasn't thinkin' 'bout shit but the payback 
 Rollin' with a panther, trained well 
 No need for the hollerin' - fuck jail 
 Only two gats in the ride 
 But the black still had, the element of surprise 
 Now I'm aimin' straight for the dome 
 'Cause I'm thinkin' about my homey's moms alone 
 Cryin' cause her baby's dead man 
 This pig finna kiss the lead man 
 As an example so all the blue coats know 
 You get poached when you fuck with black folk 
 Said it till my voice was hoarse 
 I ain't down with excessive force 
 But of course I wasn't heard so I'm silent now 
 Black folk can't be non-violent now 
 I'd rather just lay you down, spray you down 
 Till justice come around 
 Cause without it there'll be no peace 
 The only motherfuckin' pig that I eat is police 
 Do it like Che said, so it work 
 Stampede, retreat in guerrilla spurts 
 And see that ya caps are peeled like potatoes 
 'Cause this is a war and pigs hate us 
 If ya don't think so ask Nina G 
 'Cause she was raped two times by OPD 
 By a motherfuckin' pig named Riley 
 So when I pinch I don't flinch or smile, see 
 I just laid low for the night to come 
 Rounded the click, to straight drop the bomb 
 And got with K-Cloud for the throwaways 
 Went far, rented a car, and took off the plates 
 And came back through to the place where 
 Everybody knew that they was gonna show they face at 
 Stepped up, crept up, as I held my breath 
 And then I squeezed, coffee, donuts, and... 
 (Blam blam blam, blam, blam) 
 (Officer down, we need backup, there's an office down here 
 Oh shit!) 
 ...Death
