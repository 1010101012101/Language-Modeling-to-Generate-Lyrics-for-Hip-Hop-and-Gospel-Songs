Good evening, I would like to report 
 On the state of our war against the American people 
 We're mounting a sustained campaign 
 To crack down on every American 
 And every person, of every faith 
 And every nation, and to bring them to justice 
 All missions are being executed according to plan 
 Without warning, or provocation 
 Americans are being swept up in an international dragnet 
 Thousands of FBI agents are on the trail of other citizens here and abroad 
 It has everything to do with hate and evil, and murder and prejudice 
 America strong 
 Federal agents, we are armed! 
 What would you do if you [screams] 
 Knew all of the things we know (Get down on the ground) 
 Would you stand up for truth (We have a warrant to search) 
 Or would you turn away too? (For the possession of illegal firearms) 
 And then what if you saw 
 All of the things that's wrong 
 Would you stand tall and strong? 
 Or would you turn and walk away... 
 What would you do if you 
 Knew all of the things we know 
 Would you stand up for truth 
 Or would you turn away too? 
 And then what if you saw 
 All of the things that's wrong 
 Would you stand tall and strong? 
 Or would you turn and walk away... 
 I see a message from the government, like every day 
 I watch it, and listen, and call 'em all suckas 
 They warnin' me about Osama or whatever 
 Picture me buyin' this scam, I said "never" 
 You in tune to a Hard Truth soldier spittin' 
 I stay committed gives a fuck to die or lose commission 
 It's all a part of fightin' devil state mind control 
 And all about the battle for your body, mind and soul 
 And now I'm hopin' you don't close ya mind, so they shape ya 
 Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us AIDS and raped us 
 Another Bush season mean another war for profit 
 All in secret so the public never think to stop it 
 The Illuminati, triple six, all connected 
 Stolen votes, they control the race and take elections 
 It's the Skull and Bones Freemason kill committee 
 See the Dragon gettin' shittier in every city 
 What would you do if you 
 Knew all of the things we know 
 Would you stand up for truth 
 Or would you turn away too? 
 And then what if you saw 
 All of the things that's wrong 
 Would you stand tall and strong? 
 Or would you turn and walk away... 
 Now ask yourself who's the one with the most to gain (Bush) 
 'Fore 911 motherfuckas couldn't stand his name (Bush) 
 Now even niggas waivin' flags like they lost they mind 
 Everybody got opinions but don't know the time 
 'Cause America's been took - it's plain to see 
 The oldest trick in the book is make an enemy 
 A phony evil so the government can do its dirt 
 And take away ya freedom, lock and load, beat and search 
 Ain't nothin' changed but more colored people locked in prison 
 These pigs still beat us but it seem we forgettin' 
 But I remember 'fore September how these devils do it 
 Fuck Giuliani ask Diallo how he doin' 
 We in the streets holla "jail to the thief" follow 
 Fuck wavin' flags bring these dragons to they knees 
 Oil blood money, makes these killers ride cold 
 Suspicious suicides, people dyin' never told 
 It's all a part of playin' God so ya think we need 'em 
 While 'Bin Ashcroft' take away ya rights to freedom 
 Bear witness to the sickness of these dictators 
 Hope you understand the time brother 'cause it's major 
 What would you do if you 
 Knew all of the things we know 
 Would you stand up for truth 
 Or would you turn away too? 
 And then what if you saw 
 All of the things that's wrong 
 Would you stand tall and strong? 
 Or would you turn and walk away... 
 So now you askin' why my records always come the same 
 Keep it real, ain't no fillers, motherfucka blingin' 
 Mine eyes seen the gory of the coming of the beast 
 So every story, every word I'm sayin' "fuck peace" 
 See you could witness the Illuminati body count 
 Don't be surprised, these is devils that I'm talkin' bout 
 You think a couple thousand lives mean shit to killers? 
 Nigga I swear to God we the ones - ain't no villains 
 Or any other word they think to demonize a country 
 Ain't no terror threat unless approval ratings slumpin' 
 So I'ma say it, for the record we the ones that planned it 
 Ain't no other country took a part or had they hand in 
 Just a way to keep ya scared so you think you need 'em 
 Praisin' Bush while that killer take away ya freedom 
 How many of us got discovered but ignore the symptoms? 
 Niggas talkin' loud but ain't nobody sayin' shit 
 And with the 4th Amendment gone, eyes are on the 1st 
 That's why I'm spittin' cyanide each and every verse 
 I see the Carlyle group and Harris Bank Accounts 
 I see 'em plead the 5th each and every session now 
 And while Reichstag burns, see the public buy it 
 I see the profilin', see the media's compliance 
 War is good for business, see the vicious, make a savior 
 Hope you understand the time brother 'cause it's major 
 What would you do if you 
 Knew all of the things we know 
 Would you stand up for truth 
 Or would you turn away too? 
 And then what if you saw 
 All of the things that's wrong 
 Would you stand tall and strong? 
 Or would you turn and walk away... 
 What would you do if you 
 Knew all of the things we know 
 Would you stand up for truth 
 Or would you turn away too? 
 And then what if you saw 
 All of the things that's wrong 
 Would you stand tall and strong? 
 Or would you turn and walk away... 
 (What would you do, what would you do?)
