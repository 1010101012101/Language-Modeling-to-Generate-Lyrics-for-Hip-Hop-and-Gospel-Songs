(Feat. da old skool) 
 The perpetating 
 Balling ass nigga on your block 
 With slave money 
 From the record company I'm popping 
 Now I'm on my way 
 To the neighborhood liquir store 
 To help sell more 
 Of that bullshit to my folks 
 Reaching for a can 
 As a man with no conscious 
 But I'm making money 
 So nigga you can watch 
 This mack-bubble 
 'Cause I'm in trouble 
 When I pop the top 
 Even though I know 
 I'm selling out my song 
 Just to make a nut 
 So nigga buy it 
 And fuck what you heard 
 Cause all of that black power bullshit 
 Is for the birds 
 Yeah, I know it's poison 
 What I'm selling out 
 But yo 
 I'm a new house nigga with a flow
