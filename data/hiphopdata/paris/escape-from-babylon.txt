"I'm saying to you, that you will in a few minutes, 
 Hear, from the man, who is taking the place, 
 Of real black leadership, who will answer the call, 
 For true freedom, justice, and equality in America. 
 Well now, do you understand?" {*applause*} 
 (Paris) 
 Brethern heed the call of enlightenment 
 Of truth, Asiatic discipline's frightenin 
 Some who act dumb embraced by decadence 
 The weak in the wake of true black militants 
 Hear the call and all heed the savior 
 Praise Allah cause in his energy made ya 
 The cream, Asiatic earth-born manchild 
 Freedom's comfort for some but meanwhile 
 Young brothers just don't realize 
 Cocaine's the plan, the devil derived 
 Produced and let loose to youth for profit 
 Fake so-called negroes won't stop it 
 Witness lies fed straight to the brotherman 
 Hopes are lost to the malevolent gameplan 
 Annihilation of original citizens 
 Of this great planet Earth - listen 
 P-Dog spits the dope words born 
 Batterram's rollin' task force swarm 
 Pigeons squawk with the talk of a new high 
 Controlled by the man whose plan is genocide 
 Intense is a sense of ignorance 
 When the wack can't get with the pro-black 
 Program that's designed to induce thought 
 Rhymes ya bought keep Panthers taught 
 Punks stay put, skinheads are flatfoot 
 Keys are played as I stay on route 
 Down the path of the righteous chosen 
 Word is born as the wack stay frozen 
 Locked in time, mindset is Babylon 
 P's the martyr while MC's babble on 
 Letter sixteen is me and some see 
 I freeze and snuff MC's like pipe dreams 
 Makin' a mark with the start of the movement 
 Tracks in fact weak wack can't do this 
 Tooth decay cause the fake been snozin 
 Lead the lost and the cost is you've been 
 Freed from lies by the wise new messenger 
 P-A-R-I-S is a blessin ya 
 Can't underestimate or recreate 
 The sounds of Scarface, let the man BREAK! 
 "There is no in-between - you are either free or you're a slave. 
 There's no such thing as second-class citizenship." {*applause*} 
 "The only politics in this country that's relevant to black people 
 Today is the politics of revolution. None other." {*applause*} 
 (Paris) 
 Which brings us to the next move - it's a simple case of 
 Show and tell or rather show and prove 
 Of made up gank moves and foolish fairy tales 
 Said by sissies, to snatch the record sales 
 So when you see me just say I told ya 
 My rhymes'll hold ya and mold ya to soldiers 
 And train your brains with the pride and the insight 
 To do what's right, yo black, it's yo' life! 
 Once upon a time called now we start this 
 A chosen one came forth from the darkness 
 To lead the lost for the cost of a beat tape 
 And make the blind see straight 'fore it's too late 
 I can't wait time's quickly runnin' out 
 Call to arms, revolution's in the house 
 Unforgettable the words of wisdom 
 Brought to life by the ten point system 
 * ONE: Freedom and power to determine our destiny 
 * TWO: Full employment for the black community 
 * THREE: Fight the capitalist with a raised fist 
 P.U.I. black and stack awareness 
 * FOUR: Decent housing for the shelter of human beings 
 * FIVE: Education and truth for the black youth 
 * SIX: All black men exempt from military service 
 Hear my words and get nervous 
 * SEVEN: A quick end to police brutality 
 Death of blacks at the hands of the P.D. 
 * EIGHT: Release of all black men who are held in prison; 
 Guilty 'fore proven innocent 
 * NINE: Black juries when our brothers are tried in court 
 And in addition to all his we want 
 * TEN: Land bread and housing and education 
 Clothing justice and peace for the black nation
