(This is a test) 
 Verse One: 
 Too many sounds irritate my earholes 
 Like Planet Rock beats from L.A. hoes 
 The same old thing same ol shit I'm tired 
 Was once on the payroll about to be fired 
 Black radio shame, pop rap's to blame 
 Program your playlist to sound the same 
 With a disco tempo, cliche intro 
 Wack rap tracks for commercial shows 
 Mindless music for the masses has to take 
 Time away from the REAL rap master 
 So I stay cool for community airplay 
 While ratings slip for the shit that you play 
 This is a test a lesson to be observed 
 No wack rhymes are heard I keep on raising the curve 
 Back and forth I never stick 'em soft I just run it 
 Punks'll shun it, gangs keep their girlies on it 
 Paris is the dog, much doper than morphine 
 Sick with the style so you can say you've seen 
 The radical magical man, master of master plan 
 So smooth from beginning to end 
 This is a test, back it up when I'm in the place 
 And all hail to the dog with the righteous bass 
 The boss I come across rough on your radiowave 
 Terror on two track whenever I'm played 
 Punks keep steppin that's the reason why I 
 Come through sicker than a L.A. driveby 
 By droppin' bombs in songs y'all keep singin' along 
 So smooth it couldn't never go wrong 
 This is a test 
 Verse Two: 
 Yo dig 
 When you buy a rap record do you buy it for dance moves 
 Or do you buy rap cause the lyrics are smooth 
 'Cause if you wanna dance you should stick with the other one 
 And leave the dog alone till the dancin is done 
 But then when you're ready for the brother who leads 
 And feeds all rap lovers with rhymes like these 
 I dish a little taste of the bass of Scarface 
 And paste a rhyme space to chase the weak-kneed 
 'Cause I don't play - well my name ain't (Cool J) (backwards) 
 I ain't TC, or N-W-A 
 I'm Paris, the asiatic lord of light 
 With the power to fight and write rhymes to stay 
 'Cause I'm hotter than lava when I be up on a microphone 
 By now you should know it the poet doper than most 
 By dispensing of ignorance how I'm keeping the wack down 
 You enter to the realm of the Scarface sound
