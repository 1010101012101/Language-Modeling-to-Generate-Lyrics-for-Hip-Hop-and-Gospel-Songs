Finna roll to the party, still in demand 
 Troopin' thicker than a ball team, packin' the van 
 Always movin' as a unit every brother stands strapped 
 But still we got enough sense to never bust 'em too fast 
 And now I'm runnin' a roll call, startin' with D 
 Big Doc and Yon, K-Cloud and E 
 Young Bob, Rich, Oz and my man A.B. 
 And can't forget Big Gene, still keepin' the peace 
 Rollin' stones still rollin' on our way to the club 
 Every spot that we step into showin' nothin' but love 
 Never payin' to play and never waitin' in line 
 We're never lookin' to start shit, but just a good time 
 And as we step into the place, you know the party is fat 
 Females wall to wall, got us all back to back 
 Rollin' thicker than butter, y'know the crew never lose 
 And some fools is jealous, cause the women is choosin' 
 I see hard stares of the glares from the young bucks 
 And the stank of the dank could make a elephant knees buck 
 I'm makin' my way to the bar for some juice when the move 
 Was interrupted by two twins and they friends sportin' body suits 
 They said whaddup, I said whaddup, and they broke it down 
 They said they want to do the oochie coochie and spread it 'round 
 I stepped back, and had to think a minute 'cause damn G 
 If you'da seen what I was seein' you woulda felt weak 
 But I thought fast, yo black I had to pass 
 I hate it when I see my sister movin too fast 
 I know you need some knowledge of self for your young ass 
 'Cause hoein' only get you kids, AIDS or crabs 
 But then, the funk start jumpin' on the other side 
 Some brothers in the corner start to havin' a fist fight 
 Gats popped, blacks dropped, the party became a riot 
 And all because some niggas didn't know how to act right 
 The fact is that it wasn't rap to blame 
 It's a shame that just a few could mess it up for the whole scene 
 But I said it once, and I'ma say it again 
 We better learn to love each other 'fore we all drop dead 
 It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all 
 I'm tryin' to wake the black with mack raps y'all 
 It's all right y'all, so don't fight y'all 
 I'm tryin' to keep us from killin' up every night y'all 
 And just live...
