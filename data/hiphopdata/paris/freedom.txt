 (Paris) 
 We come back to the days of - grenades up 
 Black fist raised up - we stay rough 
 Come this way cause - the game fucked 
 Can't stay away from - the main stuff 
 Still bust when we ride, still game 
 Still bust any time, fuck fame 
 Still rhyme under pressure, still bangin' 
 Still prime, niggas wetcha, still aimin' 
 Still put a fist in - the system 
 Still kill a killa cop, we still win 
 Still be the one to expose the beast (when it's) 
 Still un-American to be for peace (yeah) 
 Revenge is a dish best served with steel 
 If it's on then, let's get it on for real 
 Can't shut us up - cut us down - never regret 
 Fuck Bush, I'ma say it loud - raisin' a fist - we holla 
 Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom 
 This is how we ride and roll - soldier fo life fo' sho 
 Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom 
 This is how we ride and roll - soldier fo life fo' sho 
 (M1 - Dead Prez) 
 RBG'd up, yeah, ready to get freed up 
 Bangin' on the system, ready to turn the heat up 
 Malcolm X cocktail, ready to burn the streets up 
 Holla if ya hear me big homie, it's time to eat somthin' 
 Picture me rollin', me Paris and Chuck D'd up 
 Dickies and white tee'd up, throwin' them O.G.s love 
 Listen up, rule number 1 is no snitchin' 
 Switch up and you gon' have to eat a clip up till you hiccup 
 (Stic - Dead Prez) 
 My reality is poverty, police brutality 
 How I came into this revolutionary mentality 
 Comin' up in my hood, it's an everyday thang 
 Niggas is hungry and starvin' that's why niggas bang 
 The O.G.s put me up on the jewels of the game 
 Ain't no wins in the street if you comin' up lame 
 That's why I walk how I walk and I claim what I claim 
 Red, Black to the Green with a gangsta lean 
 Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom 
 This is how we ride and roll - soldier fo life fo' sho 
 Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom 
 This is how we ride and roll - soldier fo life fo' sho 
 (Paris) 
 Rebels at it come again 
 That's why we conspire so you never win 
 Keep it calmer when we ride so you never seein' 
 Niggas aim between the eyes so you never mend 
 Field niggas in the front be the first to bust 
 GuerrillaFunk.com who you gon' trust? 
 With all this talk about the war they forgettin' us 
 Broke schools and abuse made the noose a must 
 Holla black - fuck a pig and these killers wars 
 Around the world every border it's the same story 
 Anywhere that it's color it ain't never peace 
 Africa, South America and Middle East 
 Move in packs bust back at these killa foes 
 Reach first make the heat spurts so he know 
 No blood for the rich - they been exposed 
 Now it's power to the people everywhere I go - and everybody's sayin'... 
 Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom 
 Yeah, my live niggas standin' in here, Yeah, my live niggas standin' over there 
 Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom 
 Yeah, my live niggas standin' in here, Yeah, my live niggas standin' over there
