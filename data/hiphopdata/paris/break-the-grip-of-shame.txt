Enter into a new realm, a new dimension 
 Pay close attention 
 And witness knowledge born on the microphone 
 For the people that I call my own 
 Remember back when good rap was just a cool dance hit 
 Even though it wasn't saying (shit) 
 Well them days is gone I don't play that 
 Pick the punk and I'll say like wack 
 Stick with the sick style for the serious 
 Hip-Hop lovers can't get enough of this 
 Black tracks on wax are so smooth 
 You can't get help but the thought to move 
 This is a call and a plea for unity 
 Black is back uplift and be free 
 Keep pushin, our movement moves on... so strong, now 
 With a raised fist I resist 
 I don't burn, so don't you dare riff 
 Or step to me, I'm strong and black and proud 
 And for the (bullshit) I ain't down 
 Life in the city's already rough enough 
 Without some young sucka runnin' up 
 You don't know me, so don't step 
 I roll to the right and then bust your lip 
 Paris is my name, I don't sleep 
 I drop science, and keep the peace 
 Here to bust this for better justice 
 Another dope Scarface release 
 This is a serious style for the gifted 
 Pro-black radical rap's uplifting 
 Still growing, the power's so strong 
 You can't stop it, now 
 (Malcolm X speech) 
 "We declare our right on this Earth 
 To be a man, to be a human being, 
 To be respected as a human being, 
 To be given the rights of a human being, 
 In this society on this earth in this day, 
 Which we intend to bring into existence, 
 By any means necessary!" 
 All right, let's start some mo' (shit) 
 Straight up on the movement tip 
 With forces strong as Allah's my third eye 
 Black is back and P-Dog'll never die 
 Who said that you can't do this 
 Can't be wise or be for the movement 
 Games I won't have so don't you play none 
 You'll see why when I'm gone 
 Skinheads end up dead 'cause I don't play 
 Brothers swarm under the form of Scarface 
 Round up, roll out, we'll roll 'em up like Rolo's 
 I stomp sixteen solo 
 Straight for the jugular, hope that I don't 
 Swarm and bust a cap by night so 
 You just keep your place 'cause I won't stop 
 I'll keep pushin that movement rock when I...
