Beep! 
 Trick Daddy 
 I figure you'se a ho but you can't help it 
 'Cause being raised by a ho is kinda hectic 
 Old material bitch 
 Gold-digging for them tender dicks 
 A real nigga never give you shit Biotch 
 Born and raised in the motherfucking projects ho 
 Getting money by at the pak Jam, by the back door 
 Wearing them shorts up your ass with a tube top 
 Letting niggas stick they fingers all in the cock 
 Pussy all big and wet, looking good and shit 
 Smelling like dead fish 
 And every week it's the same shit you and that lil shit 
 And every time I see you, you got to have dick 
 You wants mo' respect 
 You gets no respect 
 And all you want is some hardcore sex 
 1, 2, 3, yes you know 
 4, 5, 6, 7 niggas in your hole 
 Back-to-back from the back, head and all 
 Doo-doo brown and licked his hairy ass balls 
 In the streets late-night me, you, and all my boys 
 What I'm thinking 'bout honey bun (honey bun) 
 You got the nigga running up in you 
 Shake it like
