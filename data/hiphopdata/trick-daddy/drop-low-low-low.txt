 Yo, y'all can call court TV 
 And a&e. let 'em know... it's over 
 Cold case files huhaaa 
 Y'all niggas wont bust no shots 
 Wont work no blocks 
 Wont talk no chops 
 And when the k go chop fuck niggas better drop to the floor, get low. 
 Y'all niggas ain't holdin' no green 
 Ain't serving no cleans 
 Ain't gettin' that cream 
 Fuck niggas ain't down with the team when you see that red beam get low 
 I got guns that'll flip your car 
 100 round drums banana clips and all 
 And if a nigga that pissed me off 
 I stick it right in his mouth, make him shit in his droors 
 And you better not flinch at all 
 'Cause all bets are off if this bitch go off. 
 Shoots clean through the back of his bead 
 Tear off the top of his grill and the side of his jaw. 
 See da streets need niggas like me, 'cause niggas like you y'all niggas ain't true 
 And when its time to go to war 
 Try your best to avoid it 'cause you niggas ain't gon shoot 
 You niggas ain't got no cash, ain't got no goons and ain't got no guns. 
 Y'all niggas ain't got no heart 
 You let pussy and cars tear you click apart 
 So when you ask them what the do 
 Nigga they do what I say do when I say to 
 So when I say lay it down 
 Don't you hesitate bitch lay it down now 
 Y'all niggas wont bust no shots 
 Wont work no blocks 
 Wont talk no chops 
 And when the k go chop fuck niggas better drop to the floor, get low low low low. 
 Y'all niggas ain't holdin' no green 
 Ain't serving no cleans 
 Ain't gettin' that cream 
 Fuck niggas ain't down with the team when you see the red beam get low 
 How you gon let your dawg get clapped up 
 And you don't even clap back, but runin them traps 
 And then you got these bitch ass niggas who snitchin on a nigga ridin' round in the car withcha 
 I should fuck both of y'all up 
 Wet up your truck and hit both of y'all up 
 Y'all done disrespect the game thinkin' it's a game 
 But no it ain't

 I turn them choppers loose and let 'em do what they do 
 I won't stop till the shots are through

 You can letem knowum I got big guns and ima squeeze when I see em 
 Y'all niggas wont bust no shots 
 Wont work no blocks
