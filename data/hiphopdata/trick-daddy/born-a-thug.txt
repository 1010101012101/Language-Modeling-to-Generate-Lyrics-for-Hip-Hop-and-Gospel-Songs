This has been a Goldrush production... 
 Shorty gonna be, 
 Shorty wanna be, 
 So he's gonna be, 
 A straight thug 
 His mama was a G 
 And daddy was a G 
 Ain't nothin' left for him to be 
 But a thug 
 This is a story 'bout a young nigga 
 Who's mama was a whore 
 And his daddy was a drug dealer 
 Ridin' round the corner from 'em was the spot 
 They sold weed, lace, base, heroin and marijuana 
 His role model was an older nigga 
 Who kept a wad of hundreds 
 'Cause he had a whole lot of money 
 Now keep in mind this is round the time that 
 Miami niggas was really tryin' to put it down 
 That's back when the pimp game played out, 
 That next year crack cocaine came out 
 It all started in the suburbs 
 But only rich folks could afford to go and smoke that good dope 
 And yo they used to call it free-base, 
 But when it made it to my block 
 Me and my boys called it crack rock 
 We used to cook it up and bag it up and sell 'em, 
 Nickles and dimes to any bitch that was buyin 
 And when he first hit middle school, 
 He was a typical, ordinary, everyday-ass dude 
 Around the time eighth grade came around 
 He had done made up his mind, 
 Nigga can't lay down now 
 His first job was a watch-out, 
 He had to scream one time every time the cops hit the block 
 We used to call him Bo Brown, 
 'Cause when he came around, 
 Close shop nigga, shut it down 
 Them lil' two-hundreds, 
 That was a lot of money, 
 Especially for a young nigga sittin' round not doin' nothin' 
 Plus his mama had a newborn from an old nigga out the hood who 
 Don't do shit for him 
 They go another bill, another mouth to feed, 
 Oh well, yo a nigga couldn't stop there 
 He gotta keep food in his crib 
 And keep the lights on, 
 Ain't like his daddy's comin' back home 
 Now just imagine the role of a thirteen-year-old 
 Who's playin' head of his household, 
 Now that shit's cold, 
 But then again I suppose, 
 You already know how the shit go 
 He advanced from watch-out man to lieutenant, 
 And now he got two feet waist-deep in it, 
 And he control the whole operation, 
 But it's kinda different, 
 'Cause he's dealin' with some stiff competition 
 And everybody wants to be buddies, 
 All of a sudden friends but then again all they see is money 
 And he ain't never too flashy wit it, 
 Not into cars and jewels, 
 Just nice clothes and new shoes 
 Half of the money went straight to his mama 
 But the other half, you know 
 The kid had to keep it stashed 
 But it's kinda hard to hide drug money, 
 But it's worse bein' a dope but none of this shit's worth dying for 
 But when it comes to livin', money's nothin' 
 Bein' dead is free 
 Now tell me, 
 What would you rather be? 
 Don't tell me, 
 Tell it to your child 
 Make your talk worthwhile and the rest, 
 He'll figure it out 
 A Motherfuckin' thug... 
 Nothin' left for him to be but a thug... 
 Motherfuckin' thug... 
 Nigga forced into this shit...
