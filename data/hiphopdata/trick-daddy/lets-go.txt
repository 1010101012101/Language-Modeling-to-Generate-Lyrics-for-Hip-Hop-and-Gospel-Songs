 And all get all loud but that ain't my style 
 And he who he gonna get, and what he gonna do

 Out there impressin his homies 
 But he stood up in front of his mama 
 I mop up the flo wit em 
 And I kick in the door and let the .44 get em 
 I got fools that'll go get em 
 That's for him, his crew and the dudes that run wit em

 Got me comin' at you bokas in the V.I. while they bumpin Lil Kon I'm a brush ya 
 It's the psycho nigga Twista from Chicago rollin' with the Miami nigga that'll crush ya 
 We already been lookin' for drama

 Feelin' fury from my tough shit that can't never be true 
 And the penicillin

 That moments ghetto (ghetto) 
 Got me deep in gats for you wheezly cats

 Played on fire nigga M-I-A 
 Never gone south of the border 
 America's most wanted you gonna get slaughtered
