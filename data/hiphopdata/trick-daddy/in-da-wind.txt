 True Story.. Buddy Roe.. 
 They say tell the truth, Shane and them (uh-huh) 
 Thank God for the thugs too... see! 
 Drop the top and let the sunshine in 
 With the wood grain, let the twanky spin 
 Get you a glass, mix the Coke and the Henn' 
 It's quite alright, with the 'dro in the wind, 
 with the 'dro in the wind 
 (Trick Daddy) 
 I'm a ol' sneaky, ol' freaky, ol' geechy-ass nigga 
 Collard green, neckbone-eatin-ass nigga 
 Always wearin my jeans baggy saggy 
 You know Florida, Georgia, South Cakalaky 
 Brought up eatin Spam and sandwich 
 Sugar water and mayonnaise sandwich 
 Share the room with bout four mo' brothers 
 But one home for 'em and wattn't no mo' covers 
 A little bad motherfucker (ah-ha) 
 Always rude and always in trouble 
 None of my teachers ain't like me (uh-huh) 
 But make it so bad, pro'ly had seven more like me

 Candy apple green, niggaz lovin this shit (lovin this shit) 
 And when the minute I act a fool 
 Ya don't like how I'm livin? Bitch fuck you (uh-huh) 
 That's right I'm a rude-ass nigga 
 Quick to do you, cut a fool-ass nigga 
 Where it at? Bout a buck six five

 You know legs when they show thigh(short thighs) 
 Eat 'em up, beat 'em up, then switch sides

 Hot whore work her con-con, Valor to the floor 
 He oughta enjoy, with the loaded four-four 
 Be sure and acquire more 'fore ya fuck with mine 
 Disrespect; I'll disconnect ya line 
 With a sick SWAT, when shit's hot, ya get shot 
 The fire, the fury, ya fuck with it not 
 Ya stoppin the grace, get out my space and my face 
 Fore me and my ace-a lay down the whole place 
 Recognize, this is the verbalize 
 Surprise, fuckin' wit me real ain't wise nigga 
 Hoes, clothes, shows, Vogues, golds 
 Big ol' bankrolls, that's all a nigga know 
 Throw yo' elbows, I'm slicker than I suppose 
 Hoes unchose, 'cause my jewelry froze 
 You know how it goes, these young niggaz don't want it like this 
 Go off and get yo' gat, to silence yo' shit check, blast!

 Lo realer, a go-rilla, flow for mo' scrilla

 Drop the top and let the sunshine in 
 With the wood grain, let the twanky spin 
 Get you a glass, mix the Coke and the Henn'
