(Feat. international jones) 
 The daddy dollas (dollas) haha 
 Get nasty, come on 
 Stig, stig, stig, stig, stig... stigstigstigstigstig 
 Who told you to put the lights on 
 I'm ready for ya I'm ready for ya 
 Who told you to put the lights on 
 I'm ready for ya I'm ready for ya 
 Listen baby I don't mean to stare 
 But I bin hypnotized by your derrierre 
 Ya sympothize if ya man's a square 
 Baby I'm a player that really don't care 
 And on a scale from one to ten 
 You like eleven twelve cause ya fine as hell 
 Ya bow legged paratoned with it 
 Eatable titties and ya ass so pretty 
 No scars no cuts do sit ups 
 And fuck enough so you don't need a tummy tuck 
 And you don't need silicon 
 Put a good bra on and show off ya own cunt whole? 
 Who told you to put the lights on 
 I'm ready for ya I'm ready for ya 
 Who told you to put the lights on 
 I'm ready for ya I'm ready for ya 
 And I love what she do 
 What she do what she do 
 What she did what she did to me 
 'Cause when her boy come through 
 She go shakin' that ass 
 Like she really wanna give it to me 
 And that ass so nice and round 
 The whole clubll shut down if it touch the ground 
 And she know 'cause she throw them cheeks 
 From the right to the left and right back to me 
 She a stone cold nympho 
 She ghetto in all forms and make it look simple 
 And I know where ya get it from 
 You a country lil' girl that was raised in the city heart 
 Who told you to put the lights on 
 I'm ready for ya I'm ready for ya 
 Who told you to put the lights on 
 I'm ready for ya I'm ready for ya 
 With the flick of my tongue 
 I can make that pussy cum 
 Come on, put it right on the tip of my tongue 
 Right there on the tip of my tongue 
 Who told you to put the lights on 
 I'm ready for ya I'm ready for ya 
 Who told you to put the lights on 
 I'm ready for ya I'm ready for ya 
 She move like she a freshman 
 Old quiet girl that her mama done kept in 
 She make straight a's her daddy's rich 
 She good in school but she love that dick 
 Most likely to succeed on vala vitorian 
 And bin explorin for him 
 She don't need no sorority 
 She thinks sororitys borin and rather have a orgy 
 And she in love with her body 
 And when she by herself 
 She like to touch herself 
 And she the type that'll eat a dick up off top 
 And wont stop till she sop up every drop 
 Who told you to put the lights on 
 I'm ready for ya I'm ready for ya 
 Who told you to put the lights on 
 I'm ready for ya I'm ready for ya
