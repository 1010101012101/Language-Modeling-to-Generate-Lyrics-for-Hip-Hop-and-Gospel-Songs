(Trick) 
 If I ain't a thug, you think I ain't a thug 
 Then tell me what I am 
 (Chorus w/ Trey Songz) 
 'Cause if I ain't a thug, why do I feel this way 
 Why the steets stay on my mind 
 Since I am a thug, why do y'all get so mad 
 Why can't cha'll accept that, it's my life 
 (Trick) 
 If I ain't a thug then y'all tell me who is 
 How many other mutha fuckas y'all know can do this 
 Yeah I'm a thug fo ever and I never ever 
 Disrespect the game or cross one of my niggas (listen) 
 Slippin' already cost one of my niggas 
 So I better select the fools that I be chillin' wit 
 And I don't know nothin', didn't hear or see nothin' 
 I can't remember, but yet still I won't forget 'em 
 I'm from the dark side, born and raised in a thug life 
 And I'm out the city from the drug dealers and wise guys 
 If I ain't a thug, then you explain it 'cause 
 How come a young nigga livin' so dangerous 
 And why my name always somehow involved in stuff 
 It's obvious, y'all can't target us 
 Yeah I'm a thug nigga, but I ain't a drug dealer 
 Three time convicted felone, so should I know better 
 (Trick) 
 From day one I've been thuggin' 
 And I'm lovin' every minute of it 
 So all you crittics and haters I'm sayin' mutha fuck ya 
 I don't like ya, and therefor I don't trust ya 
 You couldn't shake me up, now you tryin' to set me up 
 It's bad enough we had it rough when we was growin' up 
 You killed Pac and Biggie, now try to kill us 
 But I throw my Fos up, 'cause I'm foeva fo sho 
 A thug rebal fo certain, that's why I never listen 
 I ain't the snitchin' kinda nigga 
 Yo, and I'm a different kinda nigga 
 So you bustas can't leave me 
 Ain't no centamental nigga 
 I'm sittin' on spinners nigga 
 So when I'm draggin' my Denim 
 Don't you bustas try and hit 'em (hear me) 
 I'm from the parts where the stars like to hear the stars 
 Quality sound beatin' down in each and every car 
 Givin' them hell like I'm David Chappelle 
 Prostitute boy there with plenty dick for sale 
 (Trick) 
 Since I am a Thug, that's why you listen to me 
 'Cause I'm a T.H.U.G. officially, you see 
 A lot a niggas still doubt a nigga 
 So when they conversatin they be playa hatin' 'bout a nigga 
 But I expect them to, what else they supposed to do 
 When they dead broke and I got more flow then they do 
 And they mad 'cause I don't fuck wit them 
 Oh well stay mad 'cause I don't kiss niggas ass (bitches) 
 I'm too busy bein' a real nigga 
 So if you fuck wit me 
 You can fuck around and get killed nigga 
 The truth is Mr. Dollars is the real deal 
 Hell I'm the mutha fucker made county bail (yeah) 
 And I'm strictly for the Thug 'cause I'm showin off 
 And I'm quick to straight fuck a nigga (what) 
 Huh, pussy nigga, what 
 For my mutha fuckin' thugs 
 (Chorus repeat till end)
