Drop the top and let the sunshine in 
 Slippin' slide and we add it again 
 T double D and a couple of friends 
 It's quite alright, with the 'dro in the wind 
 With the 'dro in the wind 
 I'm a ol' sneaky, ol' freaky, ol' geechy ass nigga 
 Collard green, neckbone eatin' ass nigga 
 Always wearin' my jeans baggy saggy 
 You know Florida, Georgia, South Cakalaky 
 Growed up eatin' Spam sandwiches 
 Sugar water and mayonnaise sandwich 
 Share the room with 'bout four mo' brothers 
 But one home for 'em and no mo' covers 
 A little bad motherfucker 
 Always rude and always in trouble 
 None of my teachers ain't like me 
 But make it so bad, pearl had seven more like me 
 If you growed up the way I did 
 You gotsta understand Trick love to kids 
 Trick love to kids 
 Drop the top and let the sunshine in 
 Slippin' slide and we add it again 
 T double D and a couple of friends 
 It's quite alright, with the 'dro in the wind 
 With the 'dro in the wind 
 Cop me a seven trees Chevy, put dubs on that bitch 
 Candy-apple green, lovin' it shit 
 And when I'm in it, I'll act a fool 
 You won't like how I'm livin', bitch, fuck you 
 That's right I'm a rude ass nigga 
 Quick to do you, cut a fool 
 Weighin' in at 'bout a buck six-five in it 
 Plus the boy gets live 
 You know legs, wings, and short thighs 
 Eat 'em up, beat 'em up, then switch sides 
 Hot whore work her Sean John velour to the floor 
 He oughta enjoy, with the loaded four-four 
 Be sure and acquire more 'fore you with mine 
 Disrespect, I'll disconnect your line 
 With a sick swat, when shit's hot, you get shot 
 The fire, the fury, could fuck with it not 
 You stoppin' the grace, get out my space and my face 
 For me and my ace-a lay down the whole place 
 Recognize, this is the verbalize, surprise with me wrong way to wise, nigga 
 Hoes, clothes, shows, Vogues, golds 
 Big ol' bankrolls, that's all a nigga know 
 Throw yo' elbows, I'm sicker than I suppose 
 Hoes unchose, 'cause my jewelry froze 
 You know how it goes, these young don't want it like this 
 Go off and get yo' get, to silence the chit-chat, blast 
 So pass, outlast, 'bout cash 
 Mo' sicky, talk tricky to the trick like trash 
 Lo realer, a gorilla, flow for mo' scrilla 
 Come clean, lookin' mean, but you ain't no killer 
 Trick love to kids 
 Drop the top and let the sunshine in 
 Slippin' slide and we add it again 
 T double D and a couple of friends 
 It's quite alright, with the 'dro in the wind 
 With the 'dro in the wind 
 Look at what we got, the rims and all the 'dro 
 The 'dro and all the smoke, my throat, it makes me choke 
 Like a serial killer was squeezin' on my throat box 
 In the cluthces of danger but not a stranger on the block 
 Is it the cheeferry, reefer beat, blowin' my chest up? 
 Beat right from the club try my best not to mess up 
 A professor of this lyrical thang, I'll take the purist strain 
 Of this slang and inject it into your veins 
 Did your heart stop man? Drop-top fame 
 Aviator shades with a rear front face 
 Movin' through the dirty at a slow pimps pace 
 Kind of like the turtle and the rabbit in the race 
 Put the finish line, I jump the pair of Reeboks 
 So bright, so fresh, snow white but no socks 
 Then I slip on some of that O with the wings 
 I'm bustin' straight out the path like a three piece 
 Prophylactic, before you slack it 
 You gotta prepare it and mack it, when your jack it over tragic 
 Not intended for any illegal purposes 
 It's like anthrax and small pox in surplus to murder us
