(Cee-Lo) Uh huh 
 (T-Dubl) Yeah 
 (Cee-Lo) Aw man I got a sweet tooth, can you dig it 
 (T-Dubl) After this one you gon need a root canal then 
 (Cee-Lo) I love sugar all of it 
 (T-Dubl) This one for all the clean, decent women 
 (Cee-Lo) Lay it on me girl 
 (T-Dubl) Pay Close Attention 
 (Hook: Cee-Lo) 
 She put that sugar on my tongue 
 She's gonna 
 Gimme gimme some 
 She put it right there on my tongue (Sweet Sweet) 
 Right there on my tongue (She turns me on, like no other) 
 (Trick Daddy) 
 And gimme some of your butter pecan 
 Put it right there on tip of my tongue, hold it 
 Right jeeeah 
 'Cause baby, if I bite you 
 I bet you like it 
 French Vanilla's a hell of a flavor for me 
 With strawberries, two cherries and whipped cream 
 The best things are the wet dreams 
 And uh, the rest is just a flick without a sex scene 
 Or lee, I speak the truth 
 'Cause the blacker the berry 
 The sweeter the juice 
 'Cause, Florida oranges and Georgia peaches 
 When they nice and ripe, they the best for eatin' 
 Southern boys we crave for old slice of pie after they main course 
 So if you game for it 
 I came for it 
 I got a thing for ya 
 That I can't ignore 
 (Ludacris) 
 She put that sugar on my tongue, tongue 
 Yippie Yippie, Yum Yum 
 Goodie goodie gum drop 
 Put me in a tongue lock 
 Did it till my body went numb, numb 
 Laid her on her back, back 
 Turned her round, gave her bottom a smack, smack 
 She's a woman from the block with the best of weave 
 But I won't stop till I'm pullin out tracks, tracks 
 It was lust at first sight 
 And she couldn't help sayin' that she wanted to get with me 
 And my size was just right 
 'Cause she wanted a man with a little sec-ur-ity 
 Said I been around the world twice 
 And my name ring bells from Atlanta to Sic-i-ly 
 Said she wanted it all night 
 So put the bubbles in the tub and Ludacris and me 
 Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 
 Yeah Yeah Yeah 
 (Lil' Kim) 
 He lickin' his lips like I'm something sweet 
 Lookin' at me like I'm something to eat 
 I got pimps givin' me the money 
 Just to taste my jar of honey 
 Cotton candy sweet as gold 
 Come and lick my tootsie roll 
 My sugar baby once you wet it 
 Give high blood pressure like a diabetic 
 How about having lil kim with your coke 
 I just can't keep these boys off me 
 Pink diamonds dudes love to frost me 
 Runnin' behind me like I'm mr. softy 
 He said I drive 'em crazy 
 Gotta sweet tooth for you baby 
 Just gonna look at 'cha lady 
 Lil kim's eye candy baby 
 (Trick Daddy) 
 Sweetie you look so incredible 
 So delicious and so damn edible 
 All I need is some honey or syrup 
 With a lil' butter to rub down all your curves 
 And no need for the lemonade 
 Just a twist of lime and some grape Kool-Aid 
 Can I call you Caramel? 
 'Cause I'm bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs 
 One bowl ought to fill me up 
 But that milk gotta be cold enough 
 So supper time that'll hold me up 
 I might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but 
 Honey, you look like a honeydew melon 
 Or strawberry with the whipped cream filling 
 Of the top part of the peach cobbler 
 But uh, the fruit platter ought to do me better
