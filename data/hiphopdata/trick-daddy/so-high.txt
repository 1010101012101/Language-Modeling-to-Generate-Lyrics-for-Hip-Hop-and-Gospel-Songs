 We High 
 Good evening ladies and gentlemen 
 This is your captain speaking to ya 
 I would like to welcome y'all aboard my flight 
 A flight that is promised to take you high 
 Way high up in the sky 
 So get out your blunts 
 Your dutchmasters 
 And your backwoods 
 And I'll turn your seatbelt signs off 
 I only smoke the best bud 
 Jamaica and Bahamas got the best serve 
 Yes sir 
 I can smoke 
 Toke after toke 
 Won't give the triple choke 
 And it won't hurt my throat 
 Nope 
 C****y eyed 
 Just riding and vibing 
 On that real fire 
 Be high for two or three hours 
 And I'm cool wit A.I. 
 But hey 
 I ain't too much into phillies 
 But split a dutch and I'll refill it 
 And ain't friendly so nope you can't hit it 
 Good trees 
 Your collard greens full of r****r seeds 
 You use too many chemicals 
 To much added stuff fool 
 That ain't real kush 
 One joint of that G-14 
 Will have you higher than your highest dreams 
 Just float-ing 
 Not knowing if your coming or going 
 But when its partly cloudy 
 Get prepared for the storm and get high 
 Roll up and feel the vibe 
 Lay back 
 Enjoy the ride (enjoy the ride) 
 Inhale (inhale) deep inside 
 Exhale (exhale) we so high 
 X2 
 In a short while 
 We'll get our lovely lovely lovely stewardess comin' through 
 With snacks and drinks 
 If anybody got cotton mouth or the munchies 
 (So high) (deep inside) 
 (We so high) 
 So y'all keep smoking that good good (deep inside) 
 Have you flyin home 
 (We so high) 
 High in the sky 
 (Lay back enjoy the ride) 
 Roll up a cigarillo 
 Fire it up and hit it 
 It feels so good man 
 It's hard for me to quit it 
 MIA land of the palm trees 
 T double D came through with the bomb trees 
 And when a n***a inhale this 
 Gotta put my shades on 
 Get behind tint 
 In the clouds 
 Lookin' down on the ground 
 8 ball 
 Big, black, player from the mound 
 Remember when I used to have them dime sacs 
 Little circle by my house was the w**d trap 
 Now my ziplock be full of bubble kush 
 Funky like a broad b**hwhen she on d****e 
 Fruit cocktail 
 You could tell by the smell 
 Burn one let the whole club know I'm here 
 (Hey) lets fly tonight 
 Come with your boy and get high tonight 
 Feel the vibe 
 Ain't nothing like being able to smoke some ol' good good 
 (Deep inside) 
 And be way up here in the air 
 (We so high) 
 Away from all the troubles 
 (Feel the vibe) 
 Problems that's going on down there 
 (Deep inside) 
 In the real worldoh it feels good don't it 
 (We so high) 
 The only people I know who don't smoke is 
 Jesus 
 CO 
 And my last P.O. 
 Yo but I ain't on no papers no more 
 I ain't gotta creep and sneak 
 At least not to blow 
 I spent my first two years getting high 
 Smoking dollar joints 
 Rolled outta 1.5 
 That was round '84 '85 
 Smoke all week for the dime 
 A n***a that live 
 Visine ain't help clear up my eyes 
 Spray cologne on when it was time for me to go home 
 I been doin' this for 20 years 
 I ain't never seen or heard one man that weed done killed 
 So just chill 
 Take a puff here or there 
 To bring you a little down off your heels 
 After that go and eat you a meal 
 But you gon have to bathe you're ass to get that smell out your hair 
 Signing off yours truly 
 It's the booger man himself 
 Well I can take you all across the world 
 Everywhere but the electric chair 
 Finna let you see everything 
 But the wind 
 But then again 
 You'll never get high like this again
