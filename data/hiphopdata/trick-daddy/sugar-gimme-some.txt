 Gimme some of your butter pecan 
 And put it right there on the tip of my tongue 
 Hold it, right chyea 
 'Cause baby, if I bite ya I bet ya like it 
 Fresh finale is a helluva fate for me 
 Strawberries two cherries and whipped cream 
 The best dreams are the wet dreams 
 The rest is just a flick without a sex scene 
 Orderly, I speak the truth 
 'Cause the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
 Florida oranges and Georgia peaches 
 When they nice and ripe they the best for eatin' 
 All southern pores be cravin' for 
 An old slice of pie after they main course 
 What they game for, I came for 
 I gotta thang for you that I can't ignore

 Yippie yippie, yum yum 
 Goodie goodie, gum drop, put me in a tongue lock 
 Did it til my body went numb numb 
 Laid her on her back back 
 Turn around gave her bottom a smack smack 
 She's the woman from the block with the best of beats 
 But I wont stop till I'm pullin' out tracks tracks 
 It was lust at first sight 
 And she couldn't help sayin' that she wanted to get with me 
 And my size was just right 
 Plus she wanted a man with a little security 
 Said I been around the world twice 
 And my name ring bells from Atlanta to Sicily 
 Says she wanted it all night 
 So put the bubbles in the tub and Ludacris and me 
 She put that sugar,

 So delicious and so damn edible 
 All I need is some honey and syrup 
 And a little butter to rub down all your curves 
 And no need for the lemonade 
 We'll pour lime and some grape Kool-Aid

 'Cause I'm bout to go coo-coo to test your cocoa puffs 
 One more I feel ya up 
 Milk butter your colon up 
 Suppertime and I don't hold me up 
 I'm 'bout to choke this up before I slow it up 
 Honey you look like a hundred 
 Eat strawberries with a whipped cream filling 
 Top baller with the peach condom 
 But a (who who) might outta do me betta
