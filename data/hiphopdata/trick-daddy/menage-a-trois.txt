I got me a girl, my little pearl. 'Cause when I met her she changed my whole world 
 But what I've seen out there, it ain't fair, all those beautiful honeys with long luscious hair 
 I just want to call'm, be ball'n, Show em' the shit that I'm haulin' 
 Bring home the bitches, take off their britches, fuck them and my girl like mad wicked witches 
 Show em' a good time, break out the wine, cause fuck'n two girls would be so fine 
 It's not a phenomenon! Two girls is all I want! In a menage a trois! Fucking like "Ooh La La!" 
 Lay em' on the bed, at the foot and the head, I want to fuck em' hard till their faces turn red 
 Give me some, let em' cum, nice and slow like ooh yum yum 
 I'll lick some clit, and suck some tits, while one of y'all deep throats my dick 
 I hope you want, my dick in your cunt, 'cause I'm gonna hit that with my funk 
 It's not a phenomenon! Two girls is all I want! In a menage a trois! Fucking like "Ooh La La!"
