If it weren't for the haters, I would've never made it 
 We the new squad, DS-Ka we are the DR 
 Murk Camp, Daddy Dollars 
 Had to grind from the bottom all the way to the top 
 I swear I won't flop, give it all I got 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 Yes sir, they wanna see us come up, and we came up 
 Ha-ha, haters 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 See, we came a long way from food stamps 
 And to thank God I made it 
 But I'm still dealing with my haters 
 Eight albums later 
 See I'm the Daddy Dollars 
 You just a big trick 
 You do more buying and begging 
 And that's that bullshit 
 I'm still strictly for the clubs 
 And they can't pimp me and they can stick me 
 'Cause they can't get me on their poles 
 This is the hater nation 
 I've learned to accept the phases 
 Not to feed into the sickness 
 Tryin' to hate the hater 
 You can't go rob a robber 
 Out drink a alcoholic 
 And you can never break a banker 
 That's the crazy way of thinkin' 
 Look, they drinkin' haterade 
 And they poppin' hater pills 
 They worryin' about a nigga 
 That's why they take to they hills 
 Had to grind from the bottom all the way to the top 
 I swear I won't flop, give it all I got 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 Yes sir, they wanna see us come up, and we came up 
 Ha-ha, haters 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 Hey, they said I would never be nothing 
 But now I'm all that 
 Goin' around and buyin' all the iceberg 
 That nigga they be talkin' about 
 They dirty my name 
 We'll be in all type of beef 
 I'm the richest, brokest, selfless skillet 
 That they ever seen 
 And I mean that I'm good 
 They watchin', and that's great 
 Two shows in one day 
 All for one mixed tape 
 Look at U2, they sold out 
 I holler "hold up" 
 And them ho's floppin' 
 Might be 'cause I'm so young in a old car 
 My diamonds gleamin' 
 That fruity got me leanin' 
 With a couple thousand stuff 
 In these new Laguna Beaches 
 That's probably why they wanna buy 
 My name's been in they mouth 
 Ever since the day I said 
 "Mother fuck the other side" 
 Had to grind from the bottom all the way to the top 
 I swear I won't flop, give it all I got 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 Yes sir, they wanna see us come up, and we came up 
 Ha-ha, haters 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 When I first entered the game, I was a non-restricted freak 
 That's right, never nominated, but they ain't hatin' me still 
 Yo, hottest scene, come and go 
 One hit, hit 'em up, two videos, and let 'em go 
 What do the future hold? Man, I don't know 
 I just do it, keep it hood and clean for the radio 
 Keep on my hater shades, blocking out they hater ways 
 And keep gettin' paid, while I'm broke, haters hate 
 I leave 'em, cap bill low sugar 
 Gettin' paid written just four word 'bout a nigga 
 If you jock me now, you hate me later 
 If you tryna stop me now, can only make me greater 
 Had to grind from the bottom all the way to the top 
 I swear I won't flop, give it all I got 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 Yes sir, they wanna see us come up, and we came up 
 Ha-ha, haters 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 Had to grind from the bottom all the way to the top 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock 
 I know why they jock, I know why they jock
