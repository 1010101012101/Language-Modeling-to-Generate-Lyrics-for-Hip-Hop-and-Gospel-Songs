 My girls takin' pills and blow 
 Two lines of coke dat I cut wit drano 
 And her nose starts to bleed

 I been gettin' high since back in junior high 
 The problems I had back then I still got 'em now 
 I got them worst tho, 'cause I always got a sore throat 
 My eyes stay red, and all my clothes smell like weed smoke 
 I think my kids know, man I hope my kids don't use and try some of the shit 
 Me and my parents did, I need to detox, I probably need god in my life dats 
 Why my heart ain't been beatn right and I'm bout to relapse I got to get up 
 And get out and run about 3 laps and sit back and relax no more of that brah 
 Where that clean at I need to clean up my act, man I really mean that
