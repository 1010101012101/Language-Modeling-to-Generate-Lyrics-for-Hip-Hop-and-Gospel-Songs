Im riding hard in the donk 
 Lookin' big in the donk 
 Gotta get it in my donk 
 Steady grillin in my donk 
 I'm riding with my top down (Top Down) 
 I'm just trying to put my mack down 
 And I'm just flossin in my heavy chevy 
 I feel like an old Seven tray impala 
 Wit no doors and no windows 
 Wit no oil no g*d dam**d water 
 Been riding around for over 200, 000 miles 
 With no tags no insurance 
 On some old bald head ass tires 
 My alignment off timing off 
 Shit lookin' real bad 
 'Cause I'm down to my last quarter tank of gas 
 Good thing the weathers in fair condition 
 'Cause where I'm from 
 All year long n****s need air condition 
 But I ain't got none 'cause my compressor gone 
 And I keep hearing a tick tick tick ticker sound 
 I think one of my heads is blown 
 They say for 1500 I can get it rebuilt 
 But I ain't got a dime 
 I'm going through some hard times 
 I ain't lyin' 
 I'm riding hard in the donk 
 Lookin' big in the donk 
 Gotta get it in my donk 
 Steady grillin in my donk 
 I'm riding with my top down (Top Down) 
 I'm just trying to put my mack down 
 And I'm just flossin in my heavy chevy 
 You know shit get rough 
 Every year around the same time 
 The longer you wait the longer it's gonna take for you to calm it down 
 And its gon take more than a check for X to pimp my ride 
 Ima need me a new blockbuster deal 
 For a n***a to live 
 Its gon take shady 4, 5 maybe 6 mil 
 I done did 6 albums n***a 
 This shits real 
 And now you trippin' 
 'Cause my transmission ain't slippin 
 I ain't getting no younger 
 I'm damn near 50 
 I've been ticketed and towed 
 And broke down on the side of the road 
 Steering column been broke up 
 But never been sold 
 So this time Ima need me some insurance 
 I need me some medical and dental and some gangsta ass instrumentals 
 So I can get this shit all chromed out 
 Painted candy apple green 
 The wettest shit a n***a ever seen 
 If daddy dollars can't do it 
 G*d dam**t it must can't be done 
 And I must be a motherf****n pearl shine 
 I'm riding hard in the donk 
 Lookin' big in the donk 
 Gotta get it in my donk 
 Steady grillin in my donk 
 I'm riding with my top down (Top Down) 
 I'm just trying to put my mack down 
 And I'm just flossin in my heavy chevy 
 Ain't nothing like and ol full tank of gas 
 Ain't nothing like being waxed and washed 
 Then being valet parked 
 And I got rid of that old bad cough 
 Got me a new cam and exhaust 
 A n***a pushing 500 horses 
 And that's without the spray 
 Get out my way 
 Get out your car 
 This green thing 
 Is a motherf****n superstar 
 The American Idol of the Chevy game 
 Trick Daddy Dollars 
 Don Dada 
 A f****n donk rider 
 I'm riding hard in the donk 
 Lookin' big in the donk 
 Gotta get it in my donk 
 Steady grillin in my donk 
 I'm riding with my top down (Top Down) 
 I'm just trying to put my mack down 
 And I'm just flossin in my heavy chevy
