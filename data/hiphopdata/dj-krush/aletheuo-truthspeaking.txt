... 
 Like June 1944 
 When all our pappy's where at war 
 We prayed before the radio-oh oh 
 But when the apple dropped that day 
 We stood and watched them blow away 
 A people full of yesterday-ay ay 
 'Cause we don't think before we speak 
 And we don't stand up for the weak 
 And we don't listen to the freaks the freaks 
 'Cause we don't clean up our own shit 
 And when refused we throw a fit 
 As we scream "I don-wanna-hear-it" "I don-wanna-hear-it" 
 "Don-wanna-hear-it" 
 Open refrigerator door 
 All the same products as before 
 Can't find new places to explore-oh oh 
 Born with 5 senses but we see 
 Much less of world reality 
 Do you believe your lunch is free-ee ee 
 'Cause we don't think before we speak 
 And we don't stand up for the weak 
 And we don't listen to the freaks the freaks 
 'Cause we don't clean up our own shit 
 And when refused we throw a fit 
 As we scream "I don-wanna-hear-it" "I don-wanna-hear-it" 
 "Don-wanna-hear-it" 
 The institution you attend 
 And all the clones that you befriend 
 Just seem to finalize your end-eh eh 
 I can recall what mother said 
 Who you become is how you fed 
 Truth is by heart not in your head ...
