Check, searching for adventure, welcome to Dementia 
 Lit sent ya, every message that he meant ta 
 Envision this, your parameters are limitless 
 30,000 feet in the air, we're all there 
 Standard procedure, land hime at Narita 
 Find reefer, hit thet telli for some leisure 
 Relaxin', lookin' out over Osaka 
 Thinkin' of a line for a rhyme that'll rock ya 
 On stage shock ya, jettin' 'cause I've gotta 
 Hit Tokyo with another dark and lonely flow 
 Language barrier, like a carrier aircraft 
 When I move my physical frame, you'll hear math 
 Numbers crunch your bones well, struggle through your own hell 
 Pray you weren't alone when your dome fell 
 Oh well, go and grab a mop for the body shop 
 And while you rot, the dead'll get the fuck up and walk 
 Strange things happen in the nighttime 
 When you leave your crib to come and hear some Hype Rhyme 
 Enter so I've got ya, Black Nosferatu 
 Rock that ass to sleep with a beat, then I'll chop you 
 Strange things happen in the nighttime 
 When you leave your crib to come and hear some Hype Rhyme 
 Enter so I've got ya, Black Nosferatu 
 When you're under spell, I'll do what the hell I want to 
 Let me lighten up, total eclipse, the universe flips 
 Sunken ships sink towards the seas' surface 
 A thousand tales of those who failed but kept composure 
 Decomposure, bloated from exposure 
 The sun bust, you better duck son, the government sonned us 
 To work toward needs and gun lust 
 We could buy our souls back, but we sold that 
 It's a no go black, Hire Skully and Kojack 
 Detectives with correctives lens perceptive 
 Tight perspective, yet missed the objective 
 Fuck it, live and let live, they can never catch Lif 
 Hit me with a beat and a mic, let's get biz 
 Lights dimmin', that means your chances of escape slimmin' 
 Hands up and heads bobbing to the rhythm 
 Blood shower, now ya body lose power 
 Within an hour, I'll teleport to Kanazaawaa 
 To start my feeding again, I'm peeling your skin 
 Then you scream, thus, release the feelings within 
 Here's a flyer, missing my event would be a sin 
 Nigga's show time's at 9, welcome, let it begin
