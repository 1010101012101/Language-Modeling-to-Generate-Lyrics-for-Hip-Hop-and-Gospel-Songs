This is Minister Metal Foot, treat a pedal like an earwig 
 And cook off by applyin' the same logic to the gearshift 
 Bird off prey circle, serf homes like I tweaked when the beak 
 Hit the bones, leave him alone 
 Leaky break fluid but ghost, the boy whip swift 
 Cruise for the unusually mutual shoes 
 In and out hot stepper lane eat fame 
 Spit the blinkin' lights back to the lions 
 Keep the name freak the frame 
 Like it lasts without compromising the mission 
 On guard to peak with the gain the second 
 The second frame twitches 
 Which is fine, I learned stay alert early 
 For the buzzards that burgle the worms 
 Know nothing of mercy 
 Wrote this one in Europe with Walz 
 While his Ravi sick at home, it's killin' him, if you can't identify 
 Peep, see when you kill the shows, then the bills unfold 
 And if the bills unfold, the children ain't gonna pick at bones 
 Only soldiers shoulders built to carry weight could troop us 
 Shake a room up scoop the venue phone 
 1800 Brooklyn zoo is Kenya home 
 I mean, it's love when the screams leave your face 
 But it's realer when your seed's fever breaks 
 Kid, I got your family, pull up a chair 
 I got a little somethin' that I want y'all to hear 
 There is much greater peace out there still 
 And if I gotta carry it home in my teeth for y'all, I will 
 There is a greater love 
 Greater than your paper cuts 
 Greater than the labor suckin' souls 
 Out of the razor tongued 
 All eyes on it, cut the edge and cut for it 
 Water and hot porridge 
 There is a medicine I know and live 
 It dissolves and swims between the bones and skin 
 When the dry walls start closin' in 
 I mosey out to hold the win 
 Kill switch, yeah, yeah 
 Kill switch, yeah, yeah 
 Kill switch 
 Welcome to sham city limits 
 Let your insects do the walkin' 
 Let your indent through the shredder 
 Let your instinct make it awkward 
 If Gitty in the gauntlet, set the phasers on kill 
 'Cause the millions that haunt it ain't offered the same pills 
 My chemical happy squad operate with freedom fighters 
 Eye of the tiger pride prize fight 
 Nighter off a Geiger napkin scribble to crack riddles 
 Fizzle back in after the ax tip rizzle grips actually swivels 
 And they won't stop askin' all the wrong questions 
 All the right answers for shit you ain't find interestin' 
 Hand pull the plug and fuck it 
 Make a hundred albums 
 Not a one for public consumption 
 Now that's that, good lovin' 
 Luggin' fetus 
 Feedback isn't what I got down for 
 Dancin' on the ceilin' with that lip 
 On the ground floor of the building 
 You'd leak anythin' from document to poison 
 To stand on your brother's face and holler buoyant 
 Float like a butterfly 
 Sting Jackals you could never shackle 
 Zooka maggots bring mavericks 
 Sing a song of sick spit blood in savage 
 Illin' children, cuttin' papers lilac in the attic 
 And I casually shift up 
 These crusaders hold a dual saber defense 
 For the cruel natured weekend drifter 
 Please, do not interrupt the placement of the steak 
 On my kin folk's plate, wait 
 There is a greater love 
 Greater than your paper cuts 
 Greater than the labor suckin' souls 
 Out of the razor tongued 
 All eyes on it, cut the edge and cut for it 
 Water and hot porridge 
 There is a medicine I know and live 
 It dissolves and swims between the bones and skin 
 When the dry walls start closin' in 
 I mosey out to hold the win 
 Kill switch, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Kill switch, kill switch 
 Kill switch, yeah, yeah
