Got the sound, you know the vibe baby 
 And DJ Krush he get down, word up you know the vibe baby 
 Yeah, and get down, word up you know the vibe bay 
 But Mos Def keep the crown, representin Brooklyn, you know the vibe yo 
 From all borders, doorways and gates 
 Resurrection draws near, mankind awaits 
 When you're livin' in this world you got to survive 
 Shaitan is lookin' on alert, attackin from all sides 
 Witness before all eyes, the evidence of unseen 
 The power past the comprehension that controls all things 
 The battle fought by good and evil is a real contest 
 It is the outcome of the struggle that we play context 
 To all sets sections cruddy clicks crews and clans 
 Gilgreens to Badlands, jump up, to understand 
 I'm just a man, not the universal architect 
 We tread the face of this heavenly place, and show respect 
 Tokyo, raise your hands, where you at 
 Osaka, raise your hands, where you at 
 DJ Krush Mos Def on the touch, we let it fly 
 I send my, salaam to my, entire squad 
 Meiso hard, wherever you are, stay on your job 
 Strugglin hard, to overcome the perils of life 
 We writin rhymes on enemy lines to shine light 
 Stay in meditation to keep the head right 
 Spreadin wings like heavenly things, we take flight 
 Flight flight flight flight flight flight flight, ha ha 
 Everything gon be all right 
 Everything gon be all right 
 And you got to believe 
 And you got to believe 
 Everything gon be all right 
 Everything gon be all right 
 I said you got to believe 
 I said you got to believe 
 Yo bust it baby 
 Me and Krush politickin buildin on this money mission 
 Somethin' so I had to stop and listen 
 It's time for ever tickin, my gift for-ever thinkin' 
 I'm tryin' to get mine cause Son it's here for the gettin' 
 Allah's provision, will help us in the providential 
 My pad and pencil, will transcribe the elemental 
 The raw essential, the South bound residential 
 The pure and simple, to resonate in your mental 
 I flash a dimple, my Shine like precious metal 
 Left the rah rah livin' alone, about to settle 
 Fast act tryin' to go slow down, and save your petrol 
 Cause the beat don't stop, like yellow cabs in the metro 
 Rejoice your verse to Earth, as the verbs connects 
 This is a daily operation like birth to death 
 And I burst the breath, yep, as a so-called vet 
 I've orchestrated designs while they slept, quiet as kept 
 Everything that you heard in advance is just a glance 
 Of the landscape, furnish we Crops And props till 
 Sunsets and Tree-dots, back jobs Of pure skill 
 At night, I do right, to excite, what truth reveal 
 Got to believe, that the Most High I see 
 Every degree, of this three-see-ix-to-e 
 We maintain Son and carry on officially 
 From troubled projects to the shores of Tripoli 
 I speak prolifically, I write reciprocally 
 Transmit upliftedly, it sounds terrific G 
 Allah has gifted me, with great ability 
 To speak to my beloved, and make 'em all love it 
 Refined rugged, a product of the ghetto public 
 Allah is the King of the world, we just subjects 
 Allah is the King of the world, we just subjects 
 Allah is the King, Allah is the King and you know 
 Everything's gon be alight 
 Everything's gon be alight 
 And you got to believe 
 And you got to believe 
 You know the vibe baby 
 Everything's gon be all right 
 Everything's gon be all right 
 You know the vibe baby 
 Everything's gon be all right 
 Everything's gon be all right 
 Yo bust it baby
