You've got a very soft vision of art 
 You've got a deficit disorder of heart 
 Thes are the wings of an endangered drum pattern 
 This is the flight of the hapless, you've got it all backwards 
 When KRUSH drops a fuckin' city buster, I call it the crowd rapist 
 Ace of base shitty compounded to drown faceless 
 Out of the ground basics found in lost spaces 
 Ashamed of its own bassline traces (that's pure hatred) 
 Perhaps the internet feeds your village fright (right) 
 I got the double ox wingspan dragon archetype tonight 
 The part that reflects light, my razorblade kite 
 Fuck it... the rugged word, my immortal beloved 
 Got you suckin off muppets for bisquick and contracts and shit 
 Printed on the back of triscuits and served rectally 
 (Jesus this shit is giving me a headache, man) 
 What a difference indifference can make 
 My bad chemistry chalkes lines like little deranged johnny the terrain bum 
 Borderline fuck ya soundbombing 
 I'm heated like broke days with nothing but noodle ramon and water 
 Water tainted, complaint filed time to transfer 
 Take me out? transfer denied, answer supplied as: 
 Stab 'em through the nipples with their own bitchy as rimshots 
 I'm audio two basic combust with strange lust 
 With modus opperandum in box than funcrush you box with soft touch 
 So much slower than the whole scenery seems 
 Moving through the plastiasine brackets backwards 
 Afterburn full thrust monks react trackless 
 Come to confront funk slugs with salt tactics 
 Turn the farrah faucet on and burn 'em in their matress 
 Murdered by a strange man in the basement of their building 
 Time to build time to be brazen with can rasing 
 The same faded disdain with a grain of insane patience 
 Patent that, fire in the sky, cataract eyes 
 This is nervous unnerving wordshit reported 
 Fortnights of journey through 
 Warning you secret pathfinder's the cast of bad sitcom 
 The laugh track's added to the last cat shit on 
 The audience claps like dillenger gun masonic rounds 
 Falling down, trample the trespass sound 
 Ample disress, amp'll get loud as terrets 
 From banchee with a megaphone, me-me-me-megaphone 
 Hold the frequency, hold it unevenly, unsheath the jihad blade 
 And become animalistic authority walks the plan, that's implicit 
 The shambles of the gifted, dismantled and imprisoned 
 This is just a cf thought car derailed and resold as old feelings 
 To those with false motion 
 All potions, pour to parched hearts open 
 Casted out, sold out in the open 
 DJ fuckin' Len'll leave the boom box dead 
 DJ Fuckin' KRUSH'll make your children throw furniture 
 Learning disabilities spring from the scene 
 Like a recessive biter gene, ignited like a flare for all teams 
 Tall beams broken, bring down the foundation 
 Found in a pool of cess where the worms unnerve stations 
 FM is just femenin breaks on rotation 
 Company Floww hold the mic naked 
 Famous (aside from murder touch) get with the once known divine style 
 I enter like Asian, demented and god-like 
 Odd mic clutched and chucked at glass structure 
 Eat at that, bodies of martars and pump action 
 Technospawn the last long-cock rhymer 
 Get with it, spaceghost the force soul weapon 
 Get with it, get got or got missing 
 You've got a very soft vision of art 
 You've got a deficit disorder of heart 
 Thes are the wings of an endangered drum pattern 
 This is the flight of the hapless, you've got it all backwards
