Lately I have been questioning and 
 What we have is loss yeah 
 I heard it in your voice 
 That we were fighting 
 Tell me where it's gone 
 Girl I thought that we could talk about whatever 
 Any problems that we had, we always worked it together 
 Did I say or is this something I've done wrong 
 Maybe I should know, but I don't 
 Still I wanna make it better 
 If something hurting you then girl let me know 
 If it's me than baby tell me 
 You don't have to ignore 
 You don't want this anymore 
 Just don't let me be the last to know 
 Honestly you got me torn (and I'm so confused) 
 Cause now a days you got a new attitude 
 And you, barely answer my calls (but when I finally get through) 
 You rush of the line, like I don't matter to you 
 Was there something I said, girl what did I do? (What have I done?) 
 If there's a problem it ain't hard for us to work it out. 
 Together, no different from what we've been through before. 
 I can't move on, and I won?t, until we make it better. 
 If something hurting you then girl let me know 
 If it's me then baby tell me 
 You don't have to ignore 
 You don't want this anymore 
 Just don't let me be the last to know 
 I never believe we go this far 
 Don't you let people tear what we have apart? 
 So girl don't do it 
 If something hurting you then girl let me know 
 If it's me then baby tell me 
 You don't have to ignore 
 You don't want this anymore 
 Just don't let me be the last to know
