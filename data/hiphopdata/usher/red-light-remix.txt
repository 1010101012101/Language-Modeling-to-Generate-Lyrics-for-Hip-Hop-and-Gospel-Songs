Hey hey

 Wotz up now wotz up now 
 Wotz up now wotz up now 
 Lets go 
 When you let me 
 Have my way and I was thinkin' I could get it again 
 Baby we could be friends if your lonely (all alone, ssh) 
 And you show me 
 Just how quick your tires could spin 
 You were off in the wind 
 Tell me were did you go 
 When you left (oh) 
 I'm thinkin' which way did she go 
 I should have known that you lead me on girl 
 I'm in the wind on cruise control 
 I gotta be dreamin' 'cause I never felt like this before 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just the one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 But she's got me sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 So why am I sittin' here 
 At the red light (lookin' crazy) 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 Lookin' out for her 
 Now its rainin 
 And I'm lookin' over at the passenger side 
 Thinkin' back in my mind how you set me off 
 She was stoppin' and droppin' it 
 Switchin from fast to slow 
 But that ain't have nothing on how you got 
 When I got you home 
 When you left (oh) 
 I'm thinkin' which way did she go 
 The way you touched yourself 
 Had me up the wall 
 I'm in the wind on cruise control 
 I'm searchin for you 'cause I can't seem to let you go 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 But she's got me sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 So why am I sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 Lookin' out for her 
 (Ludacris) 
 Uh yeah uh 
 She had a coke bottle shape 
 Pretty big booty, small waist 
 Now I feel a little woozy 
 'Cause I really wanna see her face once more 
 Now this woman got me messed up in my head 
 I forgot about my thoughts and what I said 
 All I can remember is one night more than one hour on one floor 
 Oh and there was one red light by the bed 
 That was glowing off her skin when I did my thing 
 We was drippin with a little bit of sweat and a whole lot of lust 
 'Cause I must of really digged her friend 
 And all I wanna say is that we handle doors 
 There ain't to many women that can handle stars 
 And what I wouldn't give just one more time 
 For the chance to grip them handle bars 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 But she's got me sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 So why am I sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her 
 Lookin' out for her 
 It was supposed to be 
 Just a one night 
 In and out and I'm out the door 
 But she's got me sittin' here 
 At the red light 
 Drivin' round lookin' out for her
