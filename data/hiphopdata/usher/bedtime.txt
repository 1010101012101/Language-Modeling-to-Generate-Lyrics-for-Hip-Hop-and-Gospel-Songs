That's right... 
 I just want you so much, can I have you baby? 
 Do you hear me baby? 
 Craving your body all through the night 
 Feels like I'm goin' through withdrawls 
 I wanna hold you 
 I'll hold you inside of these arms 
 Dying to taste you, I can't deny 
 Can't get it out my mind 
 Please let me hold you 
 'Cause I need your loving tonight 
 Whenever I'm near you 
 My love just comes down 
 Whenever I see you 
 I just want you around (oh usher does) 
 'Cause I wanna feel you 
 All through the day and the night (oh baby) 
 Whenever I'm near you 
 It feels like bedtime (oh oh) 
 Constantly thinking of things to do 
 Places where we can make love 
 Cause, I wanna freak you 
 I'll freak you where ever you want 
 Placing my kisses all over you 
 Caressing you so nice and slow 
 Oh how I want you 
 Girl, there's something I want you to know 
 Whenever I'm near you 
 My love just comes down (yeah) 
 Whenever I see you 
 I just want you around 
 (I just want it baby, I just want it baby) 
 'Cause I wanna feel you 
 All through the day and the night 
 Whenever I'm near you 
 It feels like bedtime 
 Do you get lonely? 
 (Do I get lonely?) 
 Thinking about me? 
 (Thinking about you, yeah?) 
 Am I the only? 
 Girl I dream of love, think of it ooh yeah 
 Are you into me? Are you mine for me? 
 Say you can't go a day without me. 
 Girl I love you, and I want you, 
 And I need you, I need you, I need you, yeah 
 (Chorus until the end) 
 Whenever I'm near you 
 My love just coms down (my love my love my love just comes down) 
 Whenever I see you 
 I just want you around (girl I want you I want you) 
 'Cause I wanna feel you (feel you all through the day and the night) 
 All through the day and the night 
 Whenever I'm near you 
 It feels like bedtime
