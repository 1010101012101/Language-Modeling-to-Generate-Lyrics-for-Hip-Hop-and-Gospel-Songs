Yo, I'm sick of this man 
 I can't even talk no more 
 'Cause I hate the fact that I love you so much 
 And you know what I'm sayin' 
 You don't even understand what this is doin' to me 
 Every time try to get away 
 I just can't let you go, you know what I'm sayin' 
 I just can't let you go 
 I never ever wanna hurt ya, I just wanna love ya 
 I just wanna sex you up 
 I wanna give you everything you need, thing you want, just lay down 
 Let me love ya all night long 
 (It was beautiful when we first started) 
 I don't want to leave you, I just wanna keep you 
 When they saw me they saw you 
 Damn the world, it's just me and my girl that's how I felt 
 Every time I thought it was right, it went left 
 We used to laugh and party 
 Now all we do is argue 
 (What happened to all the good times) 
 I tell myself I don't want you no more but 
 I can't let you go 
 (You see I can't let you go) 
 So much love and hurt and hate 
 (I hate this) 
 People screamin' it won't work 
 Time and time I say I'm gonna leave 
 (See what I'm sayin') 
 But I can't let you go 
 Now you wanna be real insensitive and act kinda funny man 
 You know what man, you ain't even gotta wait till in the mornin' man 
 You can get out of here tonight man 
 Ayo Glen come grab her shit and get her outta here 
 Baby you don't gotta like me but you're not gonna fight me 
 You can't walk away and say 
 I never gave you everything you want, thing you need 
 All we ever do is argue all night long 
 I don't wanna leave ya, see ya with anotha brotha lovin' ya 
 Sayin', damn the world, it's me and my girl 
 It's how I feel when you think everything is real 
 But it really ain't 
 We used to laugh and party 
 Now all we do is argue 
 I tell myself I don't want you no more but 
 I can't let you go 
 So much love and hurt and hate 
 People screamin' it won't work 
 Time and time I say I'm gonna leave 
 But I can't let you go 
 We used to laugh and party 
 Now all we do is argue 
 I tell myself I don't want you no more but 
 I can't let you go 
 So much love and hurt and hate 
 People screamin' it won't work 
 Time and time I say I'm gonna leave 
 But I can't let you go 
 Got me, walkin' around, ready to snap 
 Got me, walkin' around lookin' for somebody to slap 
 Got me, goin', goin' with no pause 
 Got me, up in cardiac everyday just 'cause 
 Got me, arguein' 'bout lil' stuff, she don't call lil' stuff 
 It get a little rough, we kiss and make up 
 She wanna, say what she wanna I don't play that 
 She wanna, constantly bring up shit from way back 
 Got me, thinkin' about her while I'm watchin' a flick 
 Got me, dippin' through traffic trying to get home quick 
 Got me, talkin' to myself I'm hatin' this 
 Got me, wantin' to wild out like I'm Jadakiss 
 Got me, in a place I never thought I would see 
 Got me, not wantin' to stay not wantin' to leave 
 Got me, happy, got me, confused 
 Got me wishin' I could get it how I used to 
 We used to laugh and party 
 Now all we do is argue 
 I tell myself I don't want you no more but 
 I can't let you go 
 So much love and hurt and hate 
 People screamin' it won't work 
 Time and time I say I'm gonna leave 
 But I can't let you go 
 We used to laugh and party 
 Now all we do is argue 
 I tell myself I don't want you no more but 
 I can't let you go 
 So much love and hurt and hate 
 People screamin' it won't work 
 Time and time I say I'm gonna leave 
 But I can't let you go
