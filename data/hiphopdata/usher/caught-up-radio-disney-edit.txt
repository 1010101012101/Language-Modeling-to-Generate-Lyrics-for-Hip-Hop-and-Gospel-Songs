I'm the kinda brotha 
 Who been doin' it my way 
 Gettin' my way for years 
 In my career 
 The kind of brotha 
 In and out my life 
 I hid love and left the tears 
 Without a care 
 Until I met this girl who turned the tables around 
 She caught me by surprise 
 I never thought I'd be the one breaking down 
 I can't figure it out why 
 I'm so 
 Caught up 
 Got me feelin' it 
 Caught up 
 I don't know what it is 
 But she's got me twisted 
 I'm so 
 Caught up 
 Got me feelin' it 
 Caught up 
 I'm losin' control 
 This girl's got a hold on me, yeah 
 Oh no 
 Let me go baby 
 Now listen 
 My momma told me 
 Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around 
 Same ol' song 
 But I was so sure 
 That it wouldn't happen to me 
 'Cause I know how to put it down 
 But I was so wrong 
 This girl was mean she really turned me out 
 My homies say this girl is crampin' my style 
 And I can't figure it out but 
 I'm so 
 Caught up 
 Got me feelin' it 
 Caught up 
 I don't know what it is 
 But it seems she's got me twisted 
 I'm so 
 Caught up 
 Got me feelin' it 
 Caught up 
 I'm losin' control 
 This girl's 
 Got a hold 
 I'm so 
 Caught up 
 Really feelin' it 
 Caught up 
 I don't know what it is 
 But it seems she's got me twisted 
 I'm so 
 Caught up 
 Really feelin' it 
 Caught up 
 I'm losin' control 
 This girl's got a hold on me 
 And I think I like it baby, oh 
 This girl was mean 
 She really turned me out 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah suga 
 My homies say this girl is crampin' my style 
 I'm so 
 Caught up 
 I'm caught up 
 I don't know what it is 
 But it seems she's got me twisted 
 I'm so 
 Caught up 
 Really feelin' it 
 Caught up 
 I'm losing control this girl's got a hold 
 I'm so 
 Caught up 
 I'm so 
 Caught up 
 I don't know what it is but it seems she's got me twisted 
 I'm caught up 
 Really feelin' it 
 Caught up 
 I'm losin' control this girl's got a hold on me
