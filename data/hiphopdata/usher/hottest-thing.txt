I've been looking at u, Turning brothers down, Song after song 
 Well it's time for me to holla now (your body is calling don't fight it) 
 Ooh I like it, You're dancing alone, What's that all about? 
 You're oh so fine 
 But its time for me to call you out (Watch how I straight run up on ya) 
 Girl I want ya 
 Ooh you're the hottest thing, in the club tonight 
 (Having) visions of making love tonight 
 With you constantly to the break of dawn 
 We can shake the spot if you say it's on. 
 Dancing so close got me up like Whoa 
 We're doing the most 
 Is leaving with you possible (Your body is saying you want to) 
 And I want you, oh Baby more than you know suge 
 If only for one night, I'll make you feel like you've been to paradise 
 (It's all up to you, tell me something baby, I know one thing) 
 Baby tell me (what's on your mind) 
 Do you think that I'm being too forward? 
 Ooh baby by coming at you, Coming at you this way 
 I can't help myself
