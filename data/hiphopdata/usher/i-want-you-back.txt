 To be the man that you deserve 
 Give me one chance to make it work

 I don't wanna crack but I need her 
 And she told me I was gon' want her back 
 Shoulda belived her 
 Now I'm wishin' I could throw me back to that exact spot 
 Where we found L-O-V-E at 
 Lose some then I lose again 
 When am gonna win some 
 I said a lot of things out of anger but I meant some 
 I brought a lot of things to the table besides income 
 I just want things to go back to how they used to be 
 I was used to you and I thought you was used to me 
 Time is against me 
 You never miss something till it's gone 
 That's my word ma 
 You convinced me 
 It might not happen but I'm still hopin' 
 And my heart is broken 
 But the door is still open 
 Pillow still soakin 
 Your boy still loapin' 
 Dutch still lit 
 And the bottle still open 
 If I don't get another chance it'll be hard to get focused 
 Give me one chance to make it work! 
 It's driving me crazy (It's driving me crazy) 
 'Cause I'm missing my baby (Missing my baby) 
 I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time 
 Oh I wish I could find you girl 
 Said I'm about to go crazy (About to go crazy) 
 'Cause I been needin' you lately (Needing you lately) 
 The love of my life but I wasn't loving you right baby 
 It's driving me crazy (It's driving me crazy) 
 'Cause I'm missing my baby (Missing my baby) 
 I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time 
 I just wish I could find you girl 
 So I'm about to go crazy (About to go crazy) 
 'Cause I been needin' you lately (Needing you lately) 
 I'm goin' outta my head and all the things that I said 
 I wish that I never said them now 
 (Mmm your gonna want me back) 
 It's the last words she said to me 
 Now I'm wishing she was still here with me 
 (Your gonna need me, need me one day) 
 And that day's here 
 (Mmm your gonna want me back) 
 And ya man gotta shed tears 
 I'm sittin' by the phone 
 Realizing she ain't ever coming home...
