Everyday he wakes up in his million dollar home 
 His life is like a video, the only reality he knows 
 He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car 
 Cruising up the boulevard 
 Driving pass people living hard 
 Complains about the gas prices but still supports the war 
 He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor 
 He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think its genocide 
 **That millions die from three lethal letters 
 He does shit to make it better 
 **And I'm thinking of you 
 Everyone wants to touch the sky 
 Nobody wants to reach back 
 For the ones who are scared to fly 
 Everybody wants heaven 
 If you don't want to sacrifice 
 Don't say nothing, don't say nothing 
 Ooh-Hush 
 Don't say nothing 
 Ooh-Hush 
 Don't say nothing 
 She watches television full of fabricated show 
 Thinks the world is just a joke, but oh little does she know 
 That there is a real life drama happening right outside her door 
 'Cause She continues to ignore, but she's like the TV - the story repeats 
 She's searching through the channels 
 Skipping pass the news, she's more entertained by lies and gossip 
 'Cause it hurts to see the truth 
 She complains about the nation 
 Think it's a waste of time to vote 
 She says the one that has been corrupted forever 
 No one tries to make it better 
 **And I'm thinking who 
 Everyone wants to touch the sky (Oh-ho) 
 Nobody wants to reach back 
 For the ones who are scared to fly (Scared to fly) 
 Everybody wants heaven (Heaven) 
 If you don't want to sacrifice (Oh) 
 Don't say nothing, don't say nothing 
 Ooh-Hush 
 Don't say nothing (My hand to my brother) 
 Ooh-Hush (Hand to my sister) 
 Don't say nothing 
 Ooh-Hush 
 Don't say nothing 
 Ooh-Hush 
 Don't say nothing 
 Yeah, yeah
