How Do I Say 
 How do I say? 
 A foreign beauty, so exotic 
 When she smiled at me 
 She took my breath away 
 She's reminiscent of a goddess 
 It's a shame that we could not communicate 
 How do I say... 
 How do I say hello? 
 I just wanna talk to you 
 How do I say you're beautiful 
 When I can't take my eyes off you? 
 I don't wanna say the wrong thing 
 I wanna use the right words to impress you 
 My baby, how do I say, how do I say? 
 How do I say? 
 The room was filled with her sweet aroma 
 When she danced her hips moved oh so sensuous 
 She speaks with her body, so hypnotic 
 In the language that I never will forget 
 I hear her calling 
 Spinning around in the crowd till she found me 
 Then she started moving closer and closer 
 Does she know that I want her, I want her 
 I wanna be with her tonight 
 So I caressed her face, kissed her lips 
 All my life I've never felt quite like this 
 I've never had a loss for words 
 One kiss from her has got me speechless 
 How do I say hello? 
 I just wanna talk to you 
 How do I say you're beautiful 
 When I can't take my eyes off you? 
 I don't wanna say the wrong thing 
 I wanna use the right words to impress you 
 Mujer bonita, how do I say, how do I say? 
 How do I say hello? 
 I just wanna talk to you 
 How do I say you're beautiful 
 When I can't take my eyes off you? 
 I don't wanna say the wrong thing 
 I wanna use the right words to impress you 
 Ma cherie, how do I say, how do I say? 
 Baby lets engage in a deep conversation 
 In the body language we speak won't need any translation 
 An odyssey of physical pleasure 
 As we explore, together this universal language 
 Of love (love, my love, my love, my love, etc.) 
 Can you tell me how do I put it into words? 
 How do I say hello? 
 I just wanna talk to you 
 How do I say you're beautiful 
 When I can't take my eyes off you? 
 I don't wanna say the wrong thing 
 I wanna use the right words to impress you
