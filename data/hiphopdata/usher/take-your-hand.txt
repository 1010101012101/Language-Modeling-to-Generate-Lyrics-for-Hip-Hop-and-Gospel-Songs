Hey, I feel I could just blow up, anytime I sould just lose control 
 Caught up in your lovin' every time I feel your touch 
 Second thoughts, small doubts start to beat me up 
 You're everything I wanted before I knew just what I wanted 
 And hey, hey, you're killing me on the inside 
 You're the only one I want I can't deny 
 Don't know what to do, what to say. 
 I'm not sure what to tell you, confused which way 
 Do I take your hand or let go? 
 Do I take your hand or let it go? 
 I can't take this feeling much more, 
 Do I take your hand or let go? 
 Don't know what to do, what to say, 
 I'm not sure what to tell you, 
 Confused which way do I go? 
 Hey, I feel I could just blow up, every time I 
 Feel your love I get get so caught up 
 It's your kiss it's your touch ti's just everything 
 But I'm feelin' like I wanna just run away 
 Can't tell you what I want, but you're everything I want 
 And hey, hey it's killing me on the inside 
 'Cause you're all I ever wanted so I can't deny 
 Somebody tell me, oh, is it that I'm so wrong, I can't say 
 Or is it my life, so young, careless ways 
 And now in your eyes so much have you wanna give 
 But the more I hold you in my arms the pressure 
 Starts to build, build, build, build, build 
 Take your hand or let go, take your hand or let go. (5x)
