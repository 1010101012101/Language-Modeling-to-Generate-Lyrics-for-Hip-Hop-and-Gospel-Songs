(Feat. Jermaine Dupri) 
 spoken: 
 Ladies 
 We gon try 
 Something different 
 This time 
 I ain't sayin' you wrong 
 For doin' it how you do 
 It fellas but 
 It something different 
 (When put 
 A lil extra in it man 
 I'm tellin' you 
 You get a lil more power) 
 Sing it ladies 
 Listen 
 Usher: 
 I see you 
 Standin' here 
 Lookin' real nice 
 I bet I know 
 What's going 
 Through your mind 
 You probably 
 Thinkin' that 
 Every man in here 
 Is lookin' 
 For somebody 
 For one night 
 Your friends 
 Drug you out 
 Cause you 
 Ain't wanna come 
 That's why 
 Your standin there 
 Actin' stuck up 
 Holdin' up the wall 
 You got 
 A misconception of men 
 Thinkin' were 
 All the same 
 Full of games 
 All because you ended up 
 With the wrong one 
 I bet you think 
 That chivalry is gone 
 Guess you 
 Ain't seen nothing 
 Like it in so long 
 It's when you open 
 Her door or come? 
 You give her your coat 
 When it's cold outside 
 A man ain't a man 
 Until hes been 
 To his woman 
 Compliments 
 And flowers 
 Really 
 Let's her know 
 That you want her 
 Let me spell it out 
 C-h-i-v-a-l-r-y 
 Girl 
 If you feel 
 Like chivalry 
 Is gone girl 
 Ima change your mind 
 Usher: 
 Your probably like 
 Why did I pick you 
 Well 
 I'm over there you 
 L double o k at me 
 Like 'ooh' 
 And I was wonderin 
 What's your anatomy 
 How you gon a-c-t 
 When I see your? 
 And ask you 
 What it do 
 And her reply 
 Was s-o double r-y 
 Thanks 
 For the compliment 
 But I gotta 
 Let you know 
 I'm probably 
 Not your type 
 You got 
 A misconception of me 
 Listen 
 And I'll make you see 
 Don't let one b-a-d 
 A double p-l-e 
 Spoil it 
 For the bunch 
 Jermaine Dupri: 
 Now this ain't 
 For everybody man 
 So don't get twisted 
 On what I'm sayin' 
 If you wit somebody 
 Right now 
 But you feel 
 That they playin' 
 Then I know 
 That you understand 
 How it feel 
 When you talk for hours 
 Show up at the door 
 Wit some flowers 
 When you put 
 A lil extra in it 
 Man it give you 
 Just a lil more power 
 Most of us 
 Go the extra mile 
 To get what even though 
 It ain't our style 
 The stuff 
 I'm talkin' 
 Most ain't seen 
 Or heard since 
 They was just 
 A lil child 
 I'm tryna show you how 
 To really get her on 
 I'm tryna show you how 
 To really get her home 
 I'm tryna show you 
 How to have 
 Shorty mind 
 All messed up 
 In the zone 
 Just tell her i
