Why do I feel, so lonely 
 Even though, you're layin beside me 
 Holdin' me, what part of you isn't there 
 And I can't sleep knowing that there is something so different 
 There's something you're not saying 
 Baby I'm scared 
 'Cause I deserve to be cheated on, 
 I deserve to be left alone 
 (I can't believe you love me like that) 
 Cause every time that I did you wrong 
 You let me come back home 
 And I can't understand why you gave me those 
 Chances (ooh) chances 
 Gave me so many of them 
 And I took advantage of them 
 We're going through 
 Changes (ooh changes) changes 
 But I'm not ready for them 
 So please don't tell me it's the end of us 
 (These changes, they breaking my heart, they breakin my heart, they breakin my heart) 
 And now my consciousness is killing me 
 Before I was afraid of you even 
 Now I think that she cheats and 
 I can see all the signs 
 It's breaking me 
 Apart to know that you denying 
 Right to my face, girl 
 I can read in between the lines 
 'Cause I deserve to be cheated on, 
 I deserve to be left alone 
 (I can't believe you love me like that) 
 Cause every time that I did you wrong 
 You let me come back home 
 And I can't understand why you gave me those 
 Chances (ooh) chances 
 Gave me so many of them 
 And I took advantage of them 
 We're going through 
 Changes (ooh changes) changes 
 But I'm not ready for them 
 So please don't tell me it's the end of us 
 (These changes, they breaking my heart, they breakin my heart, they breakin my heart) 
 I got this paranoid feeling 
 That I can't avoid 
 You say I'm trippin' 
 But I think you're pushing me away 
 And I'm so sorry for 
 All the wrong I did before 
 I wish that our love could stay the same 
 Why'd you give me no chances... 
 Chances, No chances 
 Gave me so many of them 
 And I took advantage of them 
 We're going through 
 Changes (ooh changes) changes 
 But I'm not ready for them 
 So please don't tell me it's the end of us
