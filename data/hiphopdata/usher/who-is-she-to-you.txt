 Don't even think about callin' me crazy 
 You know you peeped that lady (yeah yeah) 
 And when I turned and look at you, you tried 
 To play it off but I can tell that you two were friends 
 She was just too nervous 
 She was lookin' like she was hurt 
 Like the memory had surfaced 
 It kinda got her pissed 
 I'm kinda wonderin' myself 
 And your really no help 
 Tell me how you two know each other so well 
 'Cause I wanna know now 
 You better start talkin' 
 Who is she to you (yeah) 
 Don't lie to me

 My eyes can see 
 Something's going on between you two 
 I think you better let me know 
 That's fo sho

 No need to explain 
 I did nothing wrong, I swear to you 
 Nothing going on with us, that's what's up 
 See I don't know why homegirl keeps on eyen' 
 On everything, I'm not lyin' (oh no) 
 You make it worst actin' all insecure 
 She see you buggin' 
 So that's why she wanna be spotted (it ain't nothin' baby) 
 Go head and say you don't trust me 
 Always goin' out of your way to bust me 
 You come up empty handed 
 I don't understand it 
 You better go head and listen 
 Girl you got it twisted 
 Don't be payin' that broad no attention 
 'Cause you're the one I'm with 
 Don't be askin' me, yeah yeah, yeah
