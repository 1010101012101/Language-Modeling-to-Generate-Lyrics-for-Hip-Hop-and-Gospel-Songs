I've walked alone and... felt as If no one cared 
 All the days, so dark and dim... 
 But it's like the rays of the sun somehow came down 
 To shine, when you were around 
 And I always thought that I'd 
 Never find that one... 
 To make me feel Forever Young... 
 But If I had one wish, my life to share 
 Would be with you and no one else 
 If I had open arms... 
 Would you have a heart to spare? 
 If ever you want me near... 
 I'll be there to run and say I'm there 
 Givin' you someone that understands 
 And a love that will never end 
 I can be all that you need and more... 
 It's time I know... I swear, never again... 
 See I think It's love, I've fallen in... 
 And I can't figure It out, the way 
 It's amazing how you surround me, 
 By the touch of your hand, If I could... 
 Everything I'd write, and the blue skies 
 Form me In your eyes to see... 
 Together you can me, Forever Young 
 But If I had one wish, my life to share 
 Would be with you and no one else 
 If I had open arms... 
 Would you have a heart to spare? 
 If ever you want me near... 
 I'll be glad to run and say I'm here 
 Someone that understands 
 And a love that would never end 
 I can be all that you need and more... 
 Can't keep running, 
 In the same direction 
 There's gotta be a better way 
 Together you and me will be... 
 Forever young... 
 But If I had one wish, my life to share 
 Would be with you, and no one else 
 If I had open arms... 
 Would you have a heart to spare? 
 And if you ever feel that you want me near... 
 I'll be there to run and say I'm there 
 Giving you someone that understands 
 And a love that will never end 
 I can be all that you need and more...
