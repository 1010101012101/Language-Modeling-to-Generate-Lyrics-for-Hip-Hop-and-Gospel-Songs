She took me on a trip to another world, 
 She said you'd never feel like this with another girl. 
 Her eyes lift as the sun rays fell over her face, 
 I was amazed. 
 Then I realized that I was in this enchanted place, 
 All I could say is baby keep on giving me more. 
 She makes me feel like I'm breathless (off with my feet, I'm floating) 
 I only hope I can take it (no gravity can hold it) 
 It's like the stars and planets are all aligned, 
 And for the first time in a while I feel alive babe. 
 I lose myself inside your love its hard to escape, 
 Ooh I can't break these chains and I don't want to baby. 
 I'm dancin on the clouds whenever I see your face, 
 And all I can say is baby keep on giving me more sugar. 
 She makes me feel like I'm weightless (off with my feet, I'm floating) 
 I only hope I can take it (no gravity can hold it) 
 She makes me feel like I'm wasted
