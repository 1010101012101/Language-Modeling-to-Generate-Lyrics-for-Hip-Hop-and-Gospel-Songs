 Now we gonna do this thing a lil different tonight 
 U gonna come over and pick me up in your ride 
 U gon knock and then you gon wait 
 Ooh you gon take me on a date 
 U gonna open my door and ima reach over and open yours 
 Gon pay for dinner take me to see a movie 
 And whisper in my ear I bet you really wanna do me 
 Girl now take me home and get up in my pants 
 Pour me up a shot and force me to the bed 
 I'm always on the top tonight I'm on the bottom 
 'Cause we trading places 
 When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping 
 'Cause we trading places

 And tell me to shut up before the neighbors hear me 
 This is how it feels when you do it like me

 Gon get it, get it get it, get it get it, 
 Gon get it, get it get it, get it get it,

 I'll be waking you up to a cup of Folgers 
 Pancakes and eggs I owe ya breakfast in bed, oh baby 
 And your orange juice sitting on the coaster 
 Toast on the side baby strawberry and grape jelly 
 You finished let me get that drink, 
 Pull the curtain from the window 
 Time to get up baby let me make this bed up 
 Today we going shopping blow 30 on me 
 Make it 60, spend it like you really love me 
 Skip dinner and we gon rent a movie 
 You order Chinese food right before you do me 
 You coming on strong baby let me wash me hands 
 She said hurry up then get in the bed 
 You get on top tonight I'm on the bottom 
 'Cause we trading places 
 When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping 
 'Cause we trading places 
 Now put it on me baby till I say Ooh weee 
 And tell me to shut up before the neighbors hear me 
 This is how it feels when you do it like me 
 We trading places 
 Gon get it, get it get it, get it get it, 
 Gon get it, get it get it, get it get it, 
 Gon get it, get it get it, get it get it,

 Take out the trash 
 With nothing but your t-shirt on

 In the kitchen going crazy we don't give a what 
 Where you want me?
