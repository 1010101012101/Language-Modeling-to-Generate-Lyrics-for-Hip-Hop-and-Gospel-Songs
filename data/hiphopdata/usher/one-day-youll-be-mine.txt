Check it out 
 Come on 
 I'm sayin' 
 You gon' be mine 
 First time I saw you baby 
 You did something to me 
 That no else has ever done 
 Ooh - it's something in your eyes 
 Caught me by surprise 
 And told me that you were the one 
 Ooh - but what's bad is I know you get a man 
 And he'll never understand 
 The chemistry between me and you - Ah baby 
 Something inside of me 
 It's saying you and I were meant to be 
 If you can think it you can have it 
 That's why I believe 
 One day you'll be mine (mine) 
 No more creepin', sleepin' around 
 Whisperin' when he's around 
 (2x) 
 Now every time I see you baby 
 It's plain to see 
 That I'm everything you've been missin' at 
 Home baby 
 So much love to share 
 It's something in the air 
 Tellin' me I should never leave you alone 
 But even though 
 I know you gotta man 
 He'll never understand 
 The chemistry between me and you - Ah baby 
 You can try to stop it but it won't quit 
 You say you don't when I know that you want It 
 I know, one day well be mine
