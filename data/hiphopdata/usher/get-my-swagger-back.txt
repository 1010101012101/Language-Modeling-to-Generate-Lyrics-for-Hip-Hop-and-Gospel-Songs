 My swagga back 
 And it's no good for me 
 To feel this way 
 It's a mark 
 On my grown man stance 
 I should be flippin it 
 Tails the move 
 Watch ur boy 
 Start flippin' it 
 But when I do that girl 
 You still don't change 
 You stay the same 
 Then we run it back 
 All over again 
 Let me loose 
 So come on in 
 (Oh, if I can) 
 If I can't have you the way 
 That I want then 
 I don't want nobody else (oh) 
 I'm selfish girl 
 I'm so so selfish girl 
 The more I give 
 What I have 
 Imma afraid anyday 
 That I won't have 
 Nothin' left
