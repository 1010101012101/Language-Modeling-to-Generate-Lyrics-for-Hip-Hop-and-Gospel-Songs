 To stay home waiting for love 
 So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does... 
 (Ludacris) 
 Damn... what's with all the long faces 
 You're looking for love in all the wrong places 
 Let's hit the clubs and girls will take their shirt off 
 If not for me for the rasberry smirnoff 
 The me and Ursher can knock'em all 
 Then we up and disappear like socks and draws 
 A town, hit the blockand get rowdy 
 We puttin' up A's like Summa Cum Laude 
 Yeah I graduated at the top of the class 
 And yeah I strap a harnest to the top of yo ass 
 And I told'em before the parties don't stop 
 So like Ripley's believe it or not 
 And when you gon' realize I'm the best ya ever had 
 Now you sittin' at home and you got it bad 
 Yo! I'm a get nice and move slow 
 So drink some prune juice and let the shit go
