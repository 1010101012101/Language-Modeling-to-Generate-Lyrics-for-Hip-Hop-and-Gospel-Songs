Listen: 
 (Deep Man's voice) 
 Love, such a lonely place 
 Nobody wants to be alone 
 To have the world... who your willin' to share with... 
 Usher: 
 I am so alone, I can't stand this feeling of being without you, 
 I'll do whatever it takes to prove I truly love you, 
 Don't, let me go, lets stay together, 
 Forever, and ever, can't sleep without you by my side...
