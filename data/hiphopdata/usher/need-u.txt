I fucked up 
 I'm man enough to admit it 
 I don't know if that makes a difference 
 And I know that 
 If you just give me a chance to explain 
 I need you 
 How you make it feel 
 Way you make me feel 
 Feel so good 
 I like it, I like it baby 
 Girl what you do to me 
 Don't give 'em my love, you ain't even like that 
 What type of point you tryna' prove 
 You hate to admit it, but you still take me back 
 All that shit you was talkin' it don't hold no wait 
 You always say, stuck in my ways (I had it coming) 
 You always say that I'll never change (in time I'll show you) 
 Ain't always wrong 
 I'll take the blame (that counts for something) 
 Man up and say, I'll own my mistakes 
 (Gotta count for something) 
 Girl I need you now, I need you now 
 Don't let me down 
 Girl what I do to you, girl what I do to you 
 Do to make it ? cold 
 Tryna hit me where it hit home 
 You and me, I know, You and me, I know 
 New friends you got new friends 
 You already know, I hit it 
 You know what it is when you see me callin' 
 You know what it is when you see me callin' 
 Yeah I know, I was wrong, but you knew better 
 Give you up, I would never 
 You always say, stuck in my ways (I had it coming) 
 You always say that I'll never change (in time I'll show you) 
 Ain't always wrong
