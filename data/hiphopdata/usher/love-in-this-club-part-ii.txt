 Shawty wanna thug, it started with a hug 
 And the rest went like this 
 I gave her neck a kissy kiss 
 She gave my neck a kiss back 
 I said we could do it like a stack 
 I mean we could do it like a G 
 On the couch in V.I.P 
 Shawty we can get it on 
 I'm like shout out to the DJ 
 For playin' this song 
 Girl, we could act like two damn fools 
 Have everybody think we doin' a dance move 
 Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya 
 Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover girl 
 And it started with a hug but now we makin' love in this club 
 And we not gonna stop just because 
 The people in the crowd are watching us 
 'Cause we don't give a damn what they say, this is th-the remix baby! 
 Usher 
 Come a little closer, let daddy put it on ya 
 Need you to know, what happens here stays here
