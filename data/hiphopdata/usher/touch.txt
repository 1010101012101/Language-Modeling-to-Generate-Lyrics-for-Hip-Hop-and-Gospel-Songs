No one can separate the bound that we share 
 'Cause every time I run and stand, it still going nowhere 
 (Chrous) 
 I just can't get over your touch 
 I get a rush 
 It builds up, 
 So dangerous 
 The way you hold me 
 It just feels so right 
 I'm hypnotized; its taking over my mind and... 
 (Just can't get over your touch) 
 (Verse One/ Chris Classic) 
 The way you move it 
 The way I touch you 
 I'm just proving how good I'll fuck you 
 Off the Richter 
 Off the meter 
 Misses Applebaum, Bonita 
 Know you feel that 
 Where my hands at 
 Makes me not care where your man's at 
 I have not fear; girl, I'm past that 
 I just want you asking me ?where ya? pants at?? 
 In the morning 
 After an evening 
 Lots of moaning, heavy breathing 
 Body's socking 
 Showers steaming 
 Got you open, loud and screaming 
 Call it passion 
 Call it lust 
 Call it classic, call it a must 
 Lay it down deep girl, all in your guts 
 Feel the rush that starts with a touch 
 (Chrous) 
 I just can't get over your touch 
 I get a rush 
 It builds up, 
 So dangerous 
 The way you hold me 
 It just feels so right 
 I'm hypnotized; its taking over my mind and... 
 (Verse Two/ Chris Classic) 
 Now when I met you 
 Knew I shouldn't get attached 
 But after one touch, it had me coming back 
 Sweat running down the side of your hip 
 I'm tongue kissing all of your lips 
 I mean all four 
 You on all fours 
 Four Season hotel, I'm on tour 
 Just reason to see you some more 
 Even gave you the keys to my door 
 I don't usually 
 Get chicks used to me, 
 That's just prove to be too much drama 
 But girl I wanna meet your mama, 
 Make her say 'bout time just like Obama 
 I got baggage 
 You got baggage 
 We should unpack it before we stack it 
 Who are we kidding, we know our status 
 Had a lot of bad chicks; you the baddest
