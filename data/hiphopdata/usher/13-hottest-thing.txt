I've been looking at you 
 Turning brothers down, song after song 
 Well, it's time for me to holla now 
 Your body is calling, don't fight it 
 Ooh I like it 
 You're dancing all alone 
 What's that all about? You're so fine 
 But it's time for me to call you out 
 Watch out, I'll straight run up on you 
 Girl I want you 
 You're the hottest thing in the club tonight 
 Having visions of making love tonight 
 With you constantly to the break of dawn 
 We can shake the spot if you say it's on, oh baby 
 Dancing so close, got me up like whoa 
 We're doing the most is living with you possible? 
 Your body is saying you want to 
 And I want you, oh baby 
 More than you know sugar if only for one night 
 I'll make you feel like you've been to paradise 
 It's all up to you, tell me something baby 
 I know one thing 
 You're the hottest thing in the club tonight 
 Having visions of making love tonight 
 With you constantly to the break of dawn 
 We can shake the spot if you say it's on 
 You're the hottest thing in the club tonight 
 Having visions of making love tonight 
 With you constantly to the break of dawn 
 We can shake the spot if you say it's on 
 Baby tell me, what's on your mind? 
 Do you think that I'm being too forward 
 Oh baby by coming at you, this way 
 I can't help myself 
 You're the hottest thing in the club tonight 
 Having visions of making love tonight 
 With you constantly to the break of dawn 
 We can shake the spot if you say it's on 
 You're the hottest thing in the club tonight 
 Visions of making love tonight 
 With you constantly to the break of dawn 
 We can shake the spot if you say it's on 
 You're the hottest thing, club tonight 
 Visions of making love tonight 
 With you constantly, break of dawn 
 Shake the spot
