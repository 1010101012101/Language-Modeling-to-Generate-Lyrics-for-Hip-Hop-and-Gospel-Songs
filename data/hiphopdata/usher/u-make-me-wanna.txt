Uh, uh, uh, uh

 Before anything began between us 
 You were like my best friend 
 The one I used to run and talk to 
 When me and my girl was having problems 
 You used to say it'll be okay 
 Suggest little nice things I should do 
 And when I go home at night and lay my head down 
 All I seem to think about was you and how 
 U make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 U make me 
 U make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 U make me, u make me 
 Now what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up 
 Knowing it should have been you 
 What's sad is that I love her but I'm falling for you 
 What should I do? 
 Should I tell my baby bye-bye? 
 Should I do exactly what I feel inside? 
 'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay 
 But I really need to get it together 
 U make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 U make me 
 U make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 U make me, u make me 
 At this point the situation's out of control 
 I never meant to hurt her but I gotta let her go 
 And she may not understand it While all of this is going on 
 I tried, I tried to fight it but the feeling's just too strong 
 U make me 
 U make me wanna 
 U make me wanna 
 U make me wanna 
 U make me wanna 
 U make me wanna 
 U make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 U make me 
 U make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 U make me 
 U make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the things that come along with 
 U make me 
 U make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you
