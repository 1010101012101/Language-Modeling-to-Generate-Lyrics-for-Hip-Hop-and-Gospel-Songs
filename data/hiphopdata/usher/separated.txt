If love was a bird then we wouldn't have our wings 
 If love was the sky we'd be blue 
 If love was a choir, U and I could never sing 
 'Cause love isn't for me and U 
 If love was an Oscar, U and I could never win 
 'Cause we could never act out our parts 
 If love is the bible, then we are lost in sin 
 Because it's not in our hearts 
 So why don't you go your way, 
 And I'll go mine 
 Live ur life 
 And I'll live mine 
 Baby, u'll do well 
 And I'll be fine 
 'Cause we're better off separated... 
 If love was a fire then we have lost the spark 
 Love never felt so cold 
 If love was a light then we're lost in the dark 
 Left with no one to hold 
 If love was a sport, we're not on the same team 
 U and I are destined to lose 
 If love was an ocean, baby, we are just a stream 
 'Cause love isn't for me and U 
 Girl, I know we had some good times 
 It's sad but now we gotta say goodbye 
 Girl you know I love U 
 I can't deny 
 Can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I 
 I know it hurts so much 
 But it's best for us 
 Somewhere along this windy road, we lost the trust 
 So I walk away, so you don't have to see me cry 
 It's killing me so, why don't you go 
 (Out) 
 I'm sorry we didn't make it.
