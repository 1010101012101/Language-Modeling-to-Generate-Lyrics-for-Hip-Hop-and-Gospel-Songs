Uh, uh huh 
 Gangster 
 I though it was love 
 Didn't wanna admit that 
 When I looked back 
 It was lust 
 Too bad I had to learn a lesson 
 They were against me 
 You were with me 
 But you never let your old thang go 
 I don't care to know why 
 Girl I guess some things 
 Can't be explained 
 It is what it is (what it is) 
 I don't know what to call it 
 'Cause I'm feelin' something else (I'm feeling something else) 
 It is what it is (what it is) 
 Just don't let yourself get caught up (uh huh) 
 When it's really something else 
 Know that is okay 
 Felt something going on 
 For every time that I fought it (uh) 
 Girl I bet that's what it was 
 Called myself being down for you (ice cold) 
 Just know that 
 Even if I already knew you 
 I already knew how you get down (uh) 
 But if that's your thang, babe 
 I ain't mad at you 
 It's cool 
 Just know I did it too 
 It is what it is 
 I don't know what to call it (don't know what to call it) 
 'Cause I'm feelin' something else (I'm feeling something else) 
 It is what it is (what it is) 
 Just don't let yourself get caught up (aww girl) 
 When it's really something else 
 Take it to the bridge 
 I'm not saying that two wrongs can make it right 
 It ain't too late for us to try (yeah) 
 Do we put back together 
 Or we say goodbye? (ha) 
 (Usher Talking) 
 Give me another chance 
 You did it to shit 
 It's all good, baby 
 You eating, right? 
 Well how can I smile, shit? 
 It's better to smile than to frown anyday 
 Yeah listen 
 It is what it is 
 I don't know what to call it (don't know what to call it) 
 'Cause I'm feelin' something else (Girl I'm feeling something else) 
 It is what it is (what it is) 
 Just don't let yourself get caught up (get caught up) 
 When it's really something else (if you want to get to be with me baby) 
 It is what it is (what it is) 
 I don't know what to call it (call it) 
 'Cause I'm feelin' something else (uh, uh yeah yeah come on) 
 It is what it is (what it is) 
 Just don't let yourself get caught up (caught up, and I) 
 When it's really something else (oh my) 
 To the bridge 
 I'm not saying that two wrongs can make it right 
 But it ain't too late for us to try (baby) 
 Do we put back together 
 Or we say goodbye? 
 (Chorus) (Repeat till end) 
 It is what it is (what is) 
 I don't know what to call it (don't know what to call it uh uh) 
 'Cause I'm feelin' something else (gonna give my love) 
 It is what it is (what it is) 
 Just don't let yourself get caught up (caught up oh no, no) 
 When it's really something else (gonna give my love) 
 It is what it is (oh, i) 
 I don't know what to call it (call it iiii) 
 'Cause I'm feelin' something else (gonna give my love) 
 It is what it is (what it is) 
 Just don't let yourself get caught up (Oh) 
 When it's really something else (gonna give my love) 
 It is what it is 
 I don't know what to call it (ooh oh yeah) 
 'Cause I'm feelin' something else (gonna give my love) 
 It is what it is (oh oh) 
 Just don't let yourself get caught up (caught up when iiii) 
 When it's really something else (gonna give my love) 
 It is what it is (what it is)
