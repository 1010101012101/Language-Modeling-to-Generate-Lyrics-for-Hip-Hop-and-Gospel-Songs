Every time I look up, I see it in your face 
 You wanna hook up wit me 
 (You know, you wanna hook up, stop playin') 
 Instead of acting like you supposed to 
 You cop an attitude like you're too good for me 
 (We know that ain't right) 
 And you know good and damn well that 
 If I wanted, I could take you from ya man 
 With my eyes closed 
 I could have you eatin' out the palm of my hand 
 And all your little girlfriends too 
 (No you can't, get with me but I want you) 
 Yes, I can and I will if I, if I want to, if I, if I want to, baby 
 Ain't nobody trying clown you 
 But you too damn old to play high school games with me 
 (You know that man too damn old) 
 Yes, you do 'cause even when I'm not around you 
 I be hearin' from my friends, you be askin' 'bout me 
 ("What's up with him?", that's what you be sayin') 
 I don't really care 
 How long you been together with your man 
 It's just a matter of time before I make you mine 
 I wanna make it clear so there's no misunderstanding 
 That I get, what I want, when I want 
 (Is that a fact) 
 If I wanted, I could take you from ya man 
 With my eyes closed 
 I could have you eatin' out the palm of my hand 
 And all your little girlfriends too 
 (No you can't, get with me but I want you) 
 Yes, I can and I will if I, if I want to, if I, if I want to, baby 
 If I wanted, I could take you from ya man 
 With my eyes closed 
 I could have you eatin' out the palm of my hand 
 And all your little girlfriends too 
 (No you can't, get with me but I want you) 
 Yes, I can and I will if I, if I want to, if I, if I want to, baby 
 (Look out, yeah, oh U.S.) 
 That I get, what I want, when I want 
 You know how it go, gurl 
 If I wanted to, I could have you doin' whatever I want you to 
 You know but right now, I'm just not really doin' that 
 But if I wanted to, anything I'm sayin' 
 You and your girls, I could have them too, it's crazy, listen 
 If I wanted, I could take you from ya man 
 With my eyes closed 
 I could have you eatin' out the palm of my hand 
 And all your little girlfriends too 
 (No you can't, get with me but I want you) 
 Yes, I can and I will if I, if I want to, if I, if I want to, baby
