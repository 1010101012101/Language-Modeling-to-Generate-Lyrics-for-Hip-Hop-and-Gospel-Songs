I'm hoping you don't mind if I stare, 
 But i, can't help being memorised by you, i, 
 Wanna run my fingers right through your hair, 
 Girl your smile in your eyes I think they paralyze me, 
 You, you've got my full attention, 
 Got my attention, 
 And watching you work baby, 
 I hope you don't mind if I mention, 
 How sexy you are, 
 I was hoping you would let me, 
 Be your partner tonight, 
 'Cause you got me open, 
 I'm feeling your sexy, 
 I'll be your passenger, 
 Let's take a ride, 
 Let's take a ride, 
 Let's take a ride, 
 Baby we can go wherever we like, 
 Let's take a ride, 
 What you doing to me ain't fair, 
 You drive me crazy, 
 Baby, 
 But I won't get up off of you, 
 I can't believe I'm not prepared, 
 I'm lost in a maze, 
 But it's cool just as long as you next to me, 
 You, you've got my full attention, 
 Got my attention, 
 And watching you work baby, 
 I hope you don't mind if I mention, 
 How sexy you are, 
 I was hoping you would let me, 
 Be your partner tonight, 
 'Cause you got me open, 
 I'm feeling your sexy, 
 I'll be your passenger, 
 Lets take a ride, 
 Lets take a ride, 
 Lets take a ride, 
 Baby we can go wherever we like, 
 Lets take a ride, 
 (Solo Verse) 
 Turn the lights off, 
 I feel a strong attraction, 
 There's only one reaction, 
 That I want, 
 The journey with me and you, 
 Our bodies all up in tune, 
 And I'm ready, to take a ride, 
 (Semi Chorus) 
 I was hoping you would let me, 
 Be your partner tonight, 
 'Cause you got me open, 
 Feeling your sexy, 
 I'll be your passenger, 
 I'm ready to ride, 
 I'm ready to ride, 
 I'll be your passenger, 
 Lets take a ride.
