I heard a rumor 
 That your girl wants me 
 I heard a rumor 
 Oh my Lord 
 Hey 
 That your girl wants me 
 Homie 
 She's tryna tell you 
 Yeah yeah 
 (The girl wants me) 
 Ooh 
 She's tryna tell you 
 Oh no 
 (The girl wants me) 
 Now listen (hey hey) 
 You've been my boy and 
 Wont knock you for it 
 From way back from around the way 
 Time has been going 
 And I've been ignoring 
 Your girl and what she has to say 
 And my nigga 
 Homie 
 She's tryna tell you 
 Yeah yeah 
 (The girl wants me) 
 All the time 
 She says be cool and you'll be calm but 
 No I say that's not the way to go 
 And many men would fight you 
 But I decided to invite you 
 And talk about this man to man 
 We're men (right) 
 If you do not want her 
 Why adjutate and taunt her 
 Hey just give her to your best friend 
 (That's when they talk man) 
 See the moral of this story is 
 Form a friend who'll ignore the kiss 
 You could turn to glorious just try 
 I consider you as more than a friend 
 I hope you can accept this 
 But the test is after we say goodbye 
 (1) 
 Baby I just spoked to him 
 Like you wanted me to 
 But you gotta promise to speak to him 
 And get his blessings too 
 Homie 
 She's tryna tell you 
 Yeah yeah 
 (The girl wants me) 
 Ooh 
 She's tryna tell you 
 Oh no 
 (The girl wants me) 
 Repeat (1) twice 
 Lets celebrate (until fade)
