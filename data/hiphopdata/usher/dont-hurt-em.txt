Bring it all together like contact 
 Fold it up two times then creep back 
 Killin' them with a flow so cold 
 Just watchin 'em go and I'm like yeee yeeee 
 Now I ain't never givin' up the green light 
 I'm the best and the rest of 'em just hype 
 Gotta keep it real 100 if you wanna cause you can't be runnin' from a great beat 
 I know you really got crow feet 
 Gotta keep it up, keep joggin the track meet 
 I keep the crowd so crunk 
 Off the rip before I jump they be callin it a clean sweep 
 (Yeah) 
 I been had it and I won't stop 
 Just to get up step a carter top notch 
 If I do it like this man I ain't gonna miss.
