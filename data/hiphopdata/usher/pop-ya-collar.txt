 People hate you yeah 
 Buying nothing that's not the best for yourself 
 Then they really hate you yeah 
 You gotta live for you and no one else 
 Don't let 'em make you feel 
 Like you're not being real 
 Just live how you wanna live 
 You gotta do for u 
 (Dig that) 
 If you work hard, play hard 
 (Dig that) 
 And do what you wanna do 
 (Dig that) 
 Just pop ya collar 
 Don't let what people say bother u 
 (Dig that)

 Stop hating, wishing, waiting 
 Anticipating for my year to fade, oh yeah
