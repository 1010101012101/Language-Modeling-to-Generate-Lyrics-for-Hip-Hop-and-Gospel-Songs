All my niggas take a walk wit me 
 U ain't gotta holla, u can talk wit to me 
 Try to learn where my thoughts could be and how I stack figures 
 Learn why I'm real, still that nigga 
 I get money I ain't gotta do a crime shit 
 I hit dimes what I need with a 9 
 Before y'all judge me be clear 
 We got nothing but heat here 
 Beware, we here 
 What's my name? Got chicks twisted like what's my game 
 Pimp thing still the same I smash it, I don't harass it 
 Ma, I'm a baller I score and pass it 
 Feel me, still me, filthy 
 Making hits is a crime I, plead guilty 
 And this is what we came to do 
 Party, Diddy, Usher, game is through 
 Come on 
 Its right 'round 11 o'clock, one of your girls just called 
 Asked you how you look, are you ready 
 U tell her you look hot, not to worry at all 
 Niggas will be shook you doing it heavy 
 She's telling you she might change but you tell her not to, your sure that she looks stunning 
 It'll be fun 
 The club will be full of game but none of that has got u 
 Me I think your runnin' 'cause I'm the one 
 Ya see 
 I don't know what you came to do girl 
 What you came to do tonight 
 But I came to party, oh oh oh 
 I don't know what you came to do girl 
 What you came to do tonight 
 But I came to party, oh oh oh 
 U're probably thinking to yourself what's the occasion 
 And believe me girl I don't just search for fun 
 The perfect gentlemen at every situation 
 And the only thing that's missing is the one 
 Is it u? 
 I don't know what you came to do girl 
 What you came to do tonight 
 But I came to party oh oh oh 
 La la la (ghetto girls) 
 La la la (is the perfect girls) 
 La la la (and the natural girls) 
 U smell me 
 Had to take the time, to open up yo mind 
 Its exactly what you are... OPEN 
 U got the mesmerizing grind 
 Your shape should be a crime 
 Damn baby you're a star 
 Your smoking 
 Ur probably thinkin' to yourself what's the occasion 
 And believe me girl I don't just search for fun 
 I'm the perfect gentleman in every situation 
 But the thing that missin' is the one 
 (Is it yooooooouuuuuuuu) 
 I don't know what you came to do girl 
 What you came to do tonight 
 But I came to party oh oh oh 
 La la la (ghetto girls) 
 La la la (suburban girls) 
 La la la (international girls) la la la lal 
 U smell me 
 I don't know what you came to do girl 
 What you came to do tonight 
 But I came to party oh oh oh 
 (Repeat and fade away)
