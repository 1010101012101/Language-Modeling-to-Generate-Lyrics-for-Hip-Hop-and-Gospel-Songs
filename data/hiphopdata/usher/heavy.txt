(...TALKiiN AT DA START...) 
 Living the life I live 
 I had to grow up quik so I 
 Became my man instantly 
 Accepted the responsibilities 
 Even ma name in lights 
 Curtain goes up and I know all eyes are on me 
 And the world dnt stop 
 When I get home 
 I gotta satisfy her needs and it's so heavy 
 Feels like the weight of the worlds on ma shoulda 
 Sometimes I wanna run away but it's so heavy 
 Everyday it gets harder the pressure 
 But I gotta do what I gotta do baby 
 What should I say to her 
 When I know she's hurt 
 But I was raised to be a man to find 
 Do everything I can to survive 
 But I hate that I miss christmas (with my family) 
 Wasnt there for a valentines kiss (for my baby) 
 But I can't replace lost tyme 
 No but can't you see baby I'm trying 
 But its heavy 
 Feels like the weight of the worlds on ma shoulda 
 Sometimes I wanna run away but it's so heavy 
 Everyday it gets harder the pressure 
 But I gotta do what I gotta do baby x2
