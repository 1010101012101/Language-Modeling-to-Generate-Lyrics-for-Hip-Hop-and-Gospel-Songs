Can you help me? 
 Anybody out there help me 
 Please can you help me? 
 Excuse me mister 
 I fell on hard times 
 I need some help 
 But don't need a dime 
 Don't turn away 
 I'll wash your clothes 
 If you let me stay 
 (I'll) find your remote, 
 Day after day 
 People walk by 
 I can't catch their eye 
 I hold up my sign 
 It says 
 Will work for love 
 I will I will I will I'll work for love 
 Overtime baby 
 It says will work for love 
 I will I will I will I'll work for love 
 For all my life 
 I will work for love 
 Can you help me? (help me) 
 Anybody out there help me (if there's anybody out there) 
 Please can you help me? 
 Excuse me you two 
 Got love to spare? 
 Search my whole heart 
 It ain't none in there 
 What makes a star 
 I'm on my last 
 Don't have no love 
 That's okay God blessed 
 Day after day 
 People walk by now 
 I can't catch their eyes 
 Holding up my sign 
 It says 
 Will work for love 
 I will I will I will I'll work for love 
 Overtime baby 
 It says will work for love 
 I will I will I will I'll work for love 
 For all my life 
 I will work for love 
 I remember the day I lost my heart (hey yeah) 
 Took it for granted I went too far 
 Fall down, crying and beg 
 To feel that love again 
 I'll Hold this sign till the very end 
 Do anything 
 I will will I will I'll work for love, 
 Overtime baby 
 It says will work for love 
 I will will I will I'll work for love 
 For all my life 
 I will work for love
