Yes step down in town again 
 You think about me now and then 
 Been missing my love a friend 
 Let's say we have a 2nd round again 
 Girls it's been a while 
 So I thought I hit you up 
 You never love for mine 
 Let's stick it up on the left doors 
 The last time I love you ...baby 
 So let me feel you up 
 Guess been a minute 
 I know you miss the way we touch 
 You can think about you don't want it 
 You don't wanna come across to... 
 Come see the light for a second 
 Girl I'm in your town, come over 
 Girl don't let me down I wanna be for long 
 Should you ...the time want it for remember 
 Girl you mean your best respect unless girl 
 Said you wouldn't but you did it, oh girl 
 I can tell you regret it 'cause you ain't been touch like this 
 Says the last time 
 ...Every time we can dance, oh daddy 
 Who else cares, let 'em out, but I'll be back around 
 Baby you can think around if you want to 
 But I gotta be have ... 
 ...Be ready for a second round 
 Girl I'm in your town, come over 
 Girl don't let me down I wanna be for long 
 Should you ...the time want it for remember 
 Girl you mean your best respect unless girl 
 Yes step down in town again 
 You think about me now and then 
 Been missing my love a friend 
 Let's say we have a 2nd round again
