I know I vowed to never do this again but I 
 I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at 
 Got something that you need to know 
 You're the realest s*** I never wrote 
 Can't hold it, gotta let it go 
 Know, that I mean every note 
 Yeah, yeah, listen baby 
 Let me start by saying that the way I 
 Feel for you has never once changed 
 And the games I've played, mistakes I made 
 Leave me sorrier than you'll ever know 
 We got a problem, baby, I can't lie 'cause lately I realize 
 That I never knew that we was on the same playing field 
 Knew that it was wrong but we let it be 
 And I know you never knew when you said, "I do" 
 That you would have to face all the pain you feel 
 It's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this 
 Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel 
 Knowing the man you love is fooling around 
 Oh, baby, said it's killing me, girl, said I just don't understand 
 Why you wanna be with this kind of man? Oh, ho 
 Why would you love a fool with all the things I do? 
 I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this 
 Trade memories for moments, trade love to be lonely 
 Guess it's just the man in me, blame it on celebrity 
 When the night time feel like the right time 
 And then spotlight feel like the bright light 
 But it's really just my fears and it still don't dry your tears 
 When I, say she ain't you and I really love you more 
 When you say if it's true why'd you do it for? 
 And I, I really don't have no excuse 
 I break your heart, make you cry, I just wanna say goodbye 
 And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this 
 Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel 
 Knowing the man you love is fooling around 
 Oh, baby, said it's killing me, girl, said I just don't understand 
 Why you wanna be with this kind of man? Oh, ho 
 Why would you love a fool with all the things I do? 
 I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this 
 What I feel I don't even gotta write it, it's like poison in my body 
 And there's no way to deny that my heart is a time bomb 
 With seconds left to explode 
 But I gotta let you know before it blows 
 That it ain't on you, it's my fault 
 All the gossip and talk behind your back when you walk 
 By the time you will know, before long you will see 
 That you deserve more, you deserve more 
 You deserve so much more than what am, I will be 
 And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this 
 Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel 
 Knowing the man you love is fooling around 
 Oh, baby, said it's killing me, girl and I just don't understand 
 Why you wanna be with this kind of man? Oh, ho 
 Why would you love a fool with all the things I do? 
 I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this 
 Live with this, can you live with this, girl? 
 I just want you to know 
 Got something that you need to know 
 You're the realest s*** I never wrote 
 Can't hold it, gotta let it go 
 Know that I mean every note, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
