Ooh, Ooh, Hey 
 (Jermaine Dupri:) 
 What ya wanna do? 
 What ya wanna do? 
 Tell me. 
 See around here, we're just too much 
 We could slow down and you still couldn't catch us 
 My town full of heavy hitters, 
 Bread getters, real fly unforgettable type niggas 
 See all I do is keep hittin' 'em up 
 Gettin' 'em up. 
 Nigga, what Little Liberaci 
 Can't nobody stop me 
 Always makin' moves 
 So you better watch me, slide 
 To the southside in my blue drop top 
 355 keepin' it live 
 When you wanna make 'em jump, jump 
 You know what to do 
 Call me and my crew to the rescue 
 Captain So So Def 
 We rocks the party till there's no one left fo' sho' 
 Turn your volume up a notch 
 And watch the ba bump bump bump bump 
 Make your speakers pop. 
 (Usher:) 
 You never miss your water your well runs dry 
 I missed my woman she said goodbye 
 Now my heart's made a change 
 My whole world's rearranged 
 And I'm ready 
 To give you what you deserve 
 Baby baby baby please. 
 Come back come on come on Come back 
 Lover this is where you belong 
 In my arms, in my world 
 As my girl 
 Come Back, come back Come Back 
 Lover this is where you belong 
 In my life, as my girl. 
 The grass is greener on the other side 
 We take people for granted till they're out of sight 
 I think that you know how much I'm going through, 
 I think that you know how much I really love you. 
 All I do, is think of you 
 I can't eat, I can't sleep 
 Baby it ain't hard to see, all I do 
 All I do 
 Is think of you 
 And your bump, bump, bump, bump 
 Bump, bump baby. 
 Come back Come back 
 Lover this is where you belong 
 In my arms, in my world 
 As my girl 
 Come Back, come back Come Back 
 Lover this is where you belong 
 In my life, as my girl. 
 It's not what you want baby 
 But what you need suar 
 Come back with me 
 Satisfaction garenteed baby.
