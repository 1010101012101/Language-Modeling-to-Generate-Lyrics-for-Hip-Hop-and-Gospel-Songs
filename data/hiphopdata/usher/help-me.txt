Living on the edge out of control 
 And the world just won't let me slow down 
 But in my biggest picture 
 Was a photo of you and me 
 Girl you know I tried 
 I work hard to provide all of the material things 
 That I thought would make you happy 
 I'm confused can you make me understand 
 'Cause I tried to give you the best of me 
 I thought we were cool maybe I was blind 
 But never took time to see 
 Will you help me 
 Tell me what you want from me 
 Can you help me 
 Tell me why you wanna leave 
 Baby help me 
 Without you my whole world is fallin' apart 
 And I'm goin' crazy 
 Life's a prison 
 When you're in love alone (ooh girl I love you) 
 I need you to come back home (you know I need you) 
 I don't want to be alone 
 Girl I put your love up on a shelf 
 And I guess I just left it to die 
 Now we're not together 
 'Cause I hurt you too many times 
 Now you're not around 
 I wish for every moment of time that got wasted 
 We used it to make sweet love 
 Baby be my guide please take my hand 
 I want you to know that I got ya if you need it 
 Don't want to be on the outside lookin' in 
 I gotta have you girl, can't you see 
 Will you help me 
 Tell me what you want from me 
 Can you help me 
 Tell me why you wanna leave 
 Baby help me 
 'Cause without you my whole world is fallin' apart 
 And without you I think I'll go crazy 
 Life's a prison 
 When you're in love alone (ooh girl I love you) 
 I need you to come back home (you know I need you) 
 I don't want to be alone (baby would you please listen to me...) 
 (Please stay, don't go, I don't want to be alone) 
 Give me another chance, I want to be your man 
 Girl you got me down here on my knees 
 Cryin', beggin' pleeding 
 I'll do anything 
 For your love 
 Whoa oh oh 
 Would you help me (Whoa oh help me) 
 Tell me what you want from me 
 Can you help me (I don't understand, girl what you did to me, help me) 
 Tell me why you wanna leave 
 Baby help me 
 Without you my whole world is fallin' apart 
 And without you, girl I'm going crazy 
 Love's a prison without your love 
 (Can you help me) Tell me why why why why why why 
 (Can you help me) Girl I'll never stop 'cause you're all I got 
 (Can you help me) Help me understand why I can't be your man 
 It's drivin' me crazy (crazy crazy crazy) 
 (Oh baby, oh oh-oh) 
 Ooh girl I love ya (Said I love you) 
 You know I need ya (Ooh I need you) 
 Can't live without ya (I can't go one day without ya) 
 Oh girl I love ya 
 You know I need ya 
 Can't live without you
