I got your Christmas card And you know It warms my heart Just to think of all the cheer We could share if you were here I made my Christmas list That I'll give To my boy St.Nick And I hope he hooks, hooks me up 'Cause I plan a special Christmas for us 
 I was hoping that you might be Comming for Christmas I was hoping that surly by New Years eve I was hoping that you might be coming And I hope that your bringing something for me 
 Now we'll chill Christmas eve I can't wait For my moms to leave We'll snuggle, I'll turn down the lights And give our gifts if the timing is right 
 I was hoping that you might be Comming for Christmas I was hoping that surly by New Years eve I was hoping that you might be coming And I hope that your bringing something for me 
 For know I will And I hope that Santa wont be late 'Cause I don't want no presents See I'm too old for toys I just want my baby She's my one and only truly one and only she's my only 
 I was hoping that you might be Comming for Christmas I was hoping that surly by New Years eve I was hoping that you might be coming And I hope that your bringing something for me
