I got your Christmas card 
 And you know, it warms my heart 
 Just to think of all the cheer 
 We could share if you were here 
 I made my Christmas list 
 That I'll give to my boy St. Nick 
 And I hope he hooks, hooks me up 
 'Cause I plan a special Christmas for us 
 I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas 
 I was hoping that surly by New Year's eve 
 I was hoping that you might be coming 
 And I hope that your bringing something for me 
 Now we'll chill, Christmas eve 
 I can't wait for my moms to leave 
 We'll snuggle, I'll turn down the lights 
 And give our gifts if the timing is right 
 I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas 
 I was hoping that surly by New Year's eve 
 I was hoping that you might be coming 
 And I hope that your bringing something for me 
 For know I will and I hope that Santa won't be late 
 'Cause I don't want no presents 
 See, I'm too old for toys, I just want my baby 
 She's my one and only truly one and only she's my only 
 I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas 
 I was hoping that surly by New Year's eve 
 I was hoping that you might be coming 
 And I hope that your bringing something for me
