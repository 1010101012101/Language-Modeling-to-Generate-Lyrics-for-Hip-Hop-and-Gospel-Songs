 Check it 
 It was like six of us 
 Three in the Benz, three in the truck 
 On eighty five going to the pub 
 Ten minutes later is when we pulled up I 
 Parked the Benz, hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims 
 Tucked in my pant leg in the tongue of my Timbs' 
 Hand in my shirt till we feel the gin 
 Proceeded to walk in just then I saw this 
 'Nificent misses sippin' on a glass of Cris' 
 With a couple of her friends giggling 
 I knew 
 You are the one 
 I don't give a damn 
 Even if ya got a man take my hand girl 
 You are the one 
 Girl I know you'll understand 
 If you just give me a dance, take a chance girl 
 Said I know you got a few with you 
 Don't even trip I got my crew here too 
 Can ya grill what ya want to do 
 I really want to chill with you 
 Tell your friends they can hop in the truck, we'll take the Benz 
 But if we split up maybe we can hook up again 
 You never know I guess that all depends 
 If I can get you from the flo' (floor) to the do' (door) of my 6-0-0 
 You all ? and? 
 So finish that Mo' (Moet) 
 Get your coat, tell your girls "come on let's go" 'cause 
 You are the one 
 I don't give a damn 
 Even if ya got a man take my hand girl 
 You are the one 
 Girl I know you'll understand 
 If you just give me a dance, take a chance gir' 
 You are the one 
 I don't give a damn 
 Even if ya got a man take my hand girl 
 You are the one 
 Girl I know you'll understand 
 If you just give me a dance, take a chance gir'
