(Usher) 
 He said 
 You swear to tell the truth 
 The whole truth 
 And nothing but the truth 
 I said 
 Yeah Man 
 Yeah, Right hand high, never tell a lie 
 Your honor, I didn't know that I hurt her 
 I didn't know she was crying 
 I didn't know it was killing this love 
 In your honor she keep saying I ain't love her 
 Can't say I ain't try 
 But I guess my love wasn't good enough 
 I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club 
 I guess I'm guilty cause girls always want to show me love 
 I guess I'm guilty for leaving and having a little fun 
 Girl I'm guilty for that girl I'm guilty 
 Don't take me to jail 
 Don't take me to jail 
 Oh, 
 Don't take me to jail 
 I did nothing to her, gave everything to her 
 For that, 
 Don't take me to jail 
 Oh, 
 Don't take me to jail 
 Don't take me to jail 
 I ain't gonna cry while you make me do the time 
 Your honor she accused me of cheating 
 It was all in her thinking 
 She gon believe what she want to 
 So what the hell am I gon do 
 Turn my life around, it ain't going down 
 She know 'bout the life I live why she crying now 
 This sh-t is so silly to me (but I won't plead that) 
 I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club 
 I guess I'm guilty cause girls always want to show me love 
 I guess I'm guilty for leaving and having a little fun 
 Girl I'm guilty for that girl I'm guilty 
 Don't take me to jail 
 Don't take me to jail 
 Take Me (Don't take me to jail) 
 How we 'posed to get along with her going through my phone 
 In her mind she decided I'm guilty 
 Don't take me to jail 
 Don't take me to jail 
 Don't take me to jail 
 Don't take me to jail 
 Don't want to cop a plea 
 I swear weren't me it don't matter cause to her I'm guilty 
 (T.I) 
 Lets go 
 Right hand to the sky 
 Strike me down if I lie 
 If she saying she the victim in this case well what am I 
 If I hurt her I ain't try to, in the club I may decide to ride through 
 She got proof well I got alibi's too 
 Couple million dollar worth of bags and full of shoes 
 7 carrot solitaire, Caribbean water blue 
 Range Rover Porsche powder mirror in the Bentley coupe 
 All the sh-t I did for her and this who you gon listen to 
 Her life I submit to you is evidence 
 I never been on bullsh-t she ain't caught me on no tiger Woods sh-t 
 Knew what I expected when she met me 
 Should have let me be 
 I'm balling against the law shorty go on arrest me then 
 I guess I'm guilty for wanting to be up in the club 
 I guess I'm guilty cause girls always want to show me love 
 I guess I'm guilty for leaving and having a little fun 
 Girl I'm guilty for that girl I'm guilty 
 Don't take me to jail 
 Oh 
 Don't take me to jail 
 If you gon treat me like a crook putting money on my books 
 Never mind forget it 
 Don't take me to jail (ooh) 
 Don't take me to jail (take me) 
 Tired of your little games, I take the blame 
 I did it, guilty
