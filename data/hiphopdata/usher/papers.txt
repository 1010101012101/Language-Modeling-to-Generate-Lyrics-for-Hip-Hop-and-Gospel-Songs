(Usher Usher Usher) 
 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers 
 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers 
 I can't, get to work on time, 
 Can't believe the words to her I just said 
 But who the hell argue 'n' fight 
 Like dogs at 6 in the morning? (in the mornin) 
 I know it's gonna be some more shit tonight 
 Our pastor's callin', tellin' me 
 I done went too far in 
 I'm seen around town 
 And my friends can't recognize me, 
 'Cuz I took a chance on love (love), 
 It's like (like), 
 I'm dyin' (Ooh dyin') 
 For you I gave my heart 
 And turned my back against the world 
 'Cause you were my girl, girl, girl 
 I done damn near lost my mama, 
 I done been through so much drama 
 I done turned into the man 
 That I never thought I'd be. 
 I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers 
 I done took all I can take 
 But you leave me no options girl 
 I can't deny how much I love you, 
 I done gave up errthing I had to 
 As hard as it is I'm afraid I gotta say 
 I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers 
 I done took all I can take 
 But you leave me no options girl 
 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers 
 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers 
 I'm losin my mind, 
 Cant figure out who's wrong or right 
 I know it's you I love 
 But then I also know it's you I don't like 
 You claim you hate who I was 
 But that's the reason you here now 
 You think I don't know what's up 
 But sweetheart that's what ruined us 
 I ain't afraid to say I got needs 
 But the only time you here for me 
 Is when the bottles poppin' 
 And everything is sweet 
 But I I'm tired of sleeping in the other room 
 Spending them long nights 
 Trying to figure out what in the hell 
 In my heart I ain't do right. (Ooh for you) 
 For you I gave my heart 
 And turned my back against the world (back against the world) 
 'Cause you were my girl, girl (girl), girl, 
 I done damn near lost my mama (mama), 
 I done been through so much drama (drama) 
 I done turned into the man 
 That I never thought I'd be. (never thought I would be) 
 I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers 
 I done took all I can take 
 But you leave me no options girl 
 I can't deny how much I love you, 
 I done gave up errthing I had to 
 As hard as it is I'm afraid I gotta say 
 I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers 
 I done took all I can take 
 But you leave me no options girl 
 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh yeah! Papers 
 Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Papers 
 Ready, ready, ready, ready 
 All my fellas up in here 
 If you had enough and you’re ready to sign say 
 Ready, ready, ready, ready (I'm ready, yes I am) 
 All my ladies if  sick and tired, 
 And yoyou’re ready to sign, say 
 Ready, ready, ready, ready (Ooh) 
 I can't keep livin this life, 
 I'm fixin' to leave it for the last time I'm 
 Ready, ready, ready, ready 
 I done damn near lost my mama, 
 I done been through so much drama 
 I done turned into the man 
 That I never thought I'd be. 
 I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers 
 I done took all I can take 
 But you leave me no options girl 
 I can't deny how much I love you, 
 I done gave up everything I had to. 
 As hard as it is I'm afraid I gotta say 
 I'm ready to sign them papers, papers, papers
