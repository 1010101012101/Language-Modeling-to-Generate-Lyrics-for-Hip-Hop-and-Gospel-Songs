Yo after tonight, don't have your girl around me 
 True playa for real, ask my nigga Pharrell 
 Yo after tonight, don't have your girl around me 
 True playa for real, ask my nigga Pharrell 
 Situations will arise in our lives 
 But you got to be smart about it 
 Celebrations with the guys, I scarified 
 'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it 
 Meanwhile I, I loved you 
 You were my girl, you see I 
 Thought the world of you 
 But you're still leavin' baby 
 U don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'm gonna be alright tonight 
 'Cause I'm gonna be alright tonight 
 Aw girl, your face is sayin' why tears in eyes 
 Should've been more smart about it 
 Should've cherished me 
 Listenin' to friends, now it's the end 
 And again no story can end without it 
 Damn right I loved you 
 You were my girl, you see I 
 Thought the world of you 
 But you're still leavin' baby 
 U don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 I'm gonna be alright tonight 
 Gonna boogie tonight 
 'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy 
 To stay home, waitin' for love 
 So tonight, I'm gonna do what 
 A single man does and that's party 
 U don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 I'm gonna be alright tonight 
 I'm gonna be alright tonight 
 I'm gonna be alright tonight 
 Gonna boogie tonight 
 'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy 
 To stay home, waitin' for love 
 I'm gonna do what 
 A single man does and that's party 
 U don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 I'm gonna be alright tonight 
 I'm gonna be alright tonight 
 I'm gonna be alright tonight
