Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 Every time I was in L.A., I was with my ex-girlfriend 
 Every time you called I told you, baby, I'm workin', no 
 I was out doin' my dirt, oh, wasn't thinkin' 'bout you gettin' hurt 
 I was hand in hand in the Beverly Center like man 
 Not givin' a damn who sees me 
 So gone, I know, so wrong, just listen 
 Acting like I didn't have you sittin' at home 
 Thinkin' about me, bein' a good girl that you are 
 Bet you probably believe, you got a good man 
 A man never would do the things, I'ma 'bout to tell you I've done 
 Brace yourself, it ain't good 
 But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else 
 Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 If I could turn back the hands of time and start all over I would 
 Instead of everything being all bad, baby, everything would be all good 
 I don't wanna lose you but I know what I'm telling you 
 Ain't gon' make you wanna stay, you probably just wanna run away 
 Or mad enough to punch me in my face 
 Been living like an idiot and deserve every bit of it, I know 
 Today is the day that I ain't gon' lie in the plan 
 And the bullshit, girl, I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry 
 But I can no longer run around with this stress on my chest 
 I confess 
 Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 Can you break it down, don't leave me, baby 
 Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 Everything that I been doing is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side with a crib and a ride 
 Been telling you so many lies, ain't none good, it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess, it's been going on so long 
 Girl, I been doing you so wrong and I want you to know that
