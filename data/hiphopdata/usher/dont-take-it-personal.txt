Don't take it personal 
 It takes a few minutes to let you stop 
 Now I remember you 
 Don't take it personal 
 Hey! 
 Hey! 
 Hi, hello, your raising smile says that we met before 
 Hi, I know, I know your face but I can't concentrate 
 Please baby wait 
 I know it seems like I am a player 
 I know it must be killing you 
 Cause you are one in a million 
 It's my fault 
 So come with me to let's go to fantasy 
 You know I'm not just feeling you 
 Girl let's get back familiar 
 It takes a few minutes to let you stop 
 Now I remember you 
 Don't take it personal

 Hey! 
 Honestly, ... friends ... 
 There is no cost for it 
 Know what you mean

 You could've had fall for it 
 I know it seems like I am a player 
 I know it must be killing you 
 Cause you are one in a million - it's my fault 
 So come with me to let's go to fantasy 
 You know I'm not just feeling you 
 Girl let's get back familiar 
 It takes a few minutes to let you stop 
 Now I remember you 
 Don't take it personal
