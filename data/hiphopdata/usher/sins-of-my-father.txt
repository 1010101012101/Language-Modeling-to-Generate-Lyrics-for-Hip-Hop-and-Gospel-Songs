My sons 
 Keep them 
 Please forgive me! 
 What now, I think this woman's went and put a hex on me 
 What now, why I let her go and put that sex on me 
 What now, I pop this shit I watch that girl undress for me 
 Uh standing her perfume in the air 
 Got it feeling different in here, yeah 
 Yeah, she took my breath away 
 On to some fancy ship into another place 
 Such an expensive trip 
 But she didn't make me pay for it with my money 
 Oh, it's the sins of my father 
 He left a debt to his son 
 To pay the the girl who's a mother 
 Collect the one, let me run, no 
 But she didn't make me pay for it with my money, 
 I paid for the sins of my father 
 I'm praying I can reverse this curse 
 Oh, now she's speaking in a tongue that sounds new to me 
 Oh, momma tell me what this could do to me 
 Oh now, I wouldn't fall for something like this usually 
 No, no, no tell me how could I ever prepare 
 If my mother never was there 
 Oh, she took my breath away 
 On to some fancy ship 
 And to another place such an expensive trip! 
 But she didn't make me pay for it with my money 
 Oh, is the sins of my father 
 He left a debt to his son 
 To pay the the girl who's a mother 
 Collect the one, let me run, no 
 But she didn't make me pay for it with my money, 
 I paid for the sins of my father 
 I'm praying I can reverse this curse 
 I don't deserve a debt that came with my birth 
 Oh, oh, oh, what happened... 
 Oh, is the sins of my father 
 He left a debt to his son 
 To pay the the girl who's a mother 
 Collect the one, let me run, no 
 But she didn't make me pay for it with my money, 
 I paid for the sins of my father 
 I'm praying I can reverse this curse
