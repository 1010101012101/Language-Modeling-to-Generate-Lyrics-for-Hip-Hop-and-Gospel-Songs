 Come on come on come on 
 (Usher + JD) 
 Come on 
 Every time I look up 
 I see it in your face 
 You wanna hook up with me 
 (U know you wanna hook up, stop playin') 
 Instead of acting like you supposed to 
 You cop an attitude like you're too good for me 
 (U know that ain't right, and you know good and damn well that) 
 (Usher) 
 If I wanted I could take ya from your man 
 (Please believe it) with my eyes closed 
 I could have you eating out the palm out of my hand 
 And all your little girlfriends too 
 (No you can't get wit me, I don't want u) 
 Yes I can and I will if I want to 
 If I - if I want to baby (c'mon) 
 Ain't nobody tryin' to clown you 
 But you too damn old to play highschool games with me 
 (U know that man, too damn old) 
 Yes you do, 'Cause even when I'm not around you 
 I be hearing from my friends you be askin' 'bout me 
 (Wats up wit him, that's what you be saying) 
 I don't really care 
 How long you been together with your man 
 It's just a matter of time before I make you mine 
 I wanna make it clear 
 So there's no mis-understanding 
 That I get, what I want, when I want (is that a fact) 
 (Look out yeah, oh U.S.) 
 ...That I get, what I want, when I want 
 (JD) 
 U know how it go girl, If I wanted to 
 I could have you doin' whatever I want you to 
 U know but right now I'm just not really doin' that 
 But if I wanted to... anything... I'm saying 
 You and your girls 
 I could have them too, its crazy, listen 
 Listen to me... (If I want you, I could take you!) 
 If I wanted I could take you from your man 
 (Please believe it) 
 With my eyes closed 
 I could have you eating out the palm out of my hand 
 And all your little girl friends too 
 (No you can't get with me and I don't want you) 
 Yes I can and I will if I -if I want to 
 If I - if I want to baby 
 If I wanted I could take you from your man 
 (Please believe it) 
 With my eyes closed 
 I could have you eating out the palm out of my hand 
 And all your little girl friends too 
 (No you can't get with me, I don't want you) 
 Yes I can and I will if I- if I want to 
 If I - if I want to baby
