Initiate radar 
 Your eyes say it all, all 
 They're fixed upon an object of desire 
 You can't control, no 
 But gravity compels you to ignite and explode, oh 
 'Til our time and space combine 
 You'll fantasize the unknown, oh 
 Girl, it's taking off the ground 
 You know how I put it down 
 Have you seen your stars, baby? 
 This is big bang, so unpredictable 
 Sex, love and drama, who's in control? 
 Mars vs Venus, yeah, when the worlds collide 
 This is the big bang, step in the ring of fire 
 Sex, love and drama, who can take desire? 
 Mars vs Venus 
 Seduce and analyze, yeah 
 Objective is to conquer deep inside 
 Make paradise 
 Girl, it's taking off the ground 
 You know how I put it down 
 Have you seen your stars? Oh 
 This is big bang, so unpredictable 
 Sex, love and drama, who's in control? 
 Mars vs Venus, when the worlds collide 
 This is the big bang, step in the ring of fire 
 Sex, love and drama, who can take desire? 
 Mars vs Venus 
 This is big bang, so unpredictable 
 Sex, love and drama, who's in control? 
 Mars vs Venus, when the worlds collide 
 This is the big bang, step in the ring of fire 
 Sex, love and drama, who can take desire? 
 Mars vs Venus 
 Oh, pitch black, glossed amidst the galaxy between the sheets 
 Warmth that only you and I generate when we collide 
 Hold that, don't make my emotions peak 
 If I let go then I'll be weak, your control is my defeat 
 I repeat never, never, never 
 Never will I give up, no, no, no, no 
 I ain't giving up now 
 This is big bang, so unpredictable 
 Sex, love and drama, who's in control? 
 Mars vs Venus, when the worlds collide 
 This is the big bang, step in the ring of fire 
 Sex, love and drama, who can take desire? 
 Mars vs Venus 
 This is big bang, so unpredictable 
 Sex, love and drama, who's in control? 
 Mars vs Venus, when the worlds collide 
 This is the big bang, step in the ring of fire 
 Sex, love and drama, who can take desire? 
 Mars vs Venus 
 When the worlds collide I don't know if I will win 
 But I know I wanna do it again, Mars vs Venus 
 When the worlds collide, I don't know if I will win 
 But I know that I wanna do it again, yeah 
 I don't know if I'll ever win, Mars vs Venus
