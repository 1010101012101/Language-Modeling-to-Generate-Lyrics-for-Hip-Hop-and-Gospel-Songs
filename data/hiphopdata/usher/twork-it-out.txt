Yo 
 Check this here 
 There nothin' that 
 I'd rather do 
 Than spend some time 
 With you 
 So why don't 
 We just chill? 
 Make it coco sexy 
 You know 
 You sure make it right 
 Spend some quality time 
 You make me wanna 
 Cha cha cha 
 Oh baby, you sure like to 
 Nah nah nah nah nah 
 Nah nah nah nah nah 
 We've been hangin' out 
 Everyday this week 
 How about I fix you 
 A little something to eat 
 And just chill 
 We ain't gotta wild out 
 Right now just chill 
 Parle lil' momma, right here 
 Sippin' on Chardonnay 
 Slip on that 
 Victoria Secret lingerie 
 'Cause I ain't tryin' 
 Throw my money away in the streets 
 If I can see you twork it 
 Out for me 
 (Twork'n it out) 
 Layin' in the cut 
 Kissing and rubbin 
 Makin' sweet love' 
 Damn the club tonight 
 Girl let's twork it out 
 (It'll be) 
 Just me on you 
 (All night) 
 From eleven till 
 Six in the morning 
 I know you like when 
 I do you like that 
 Just twork it out 
 Now that I got you 
 All soaking wet 
 I bet you know 
 What's coming next 
 (You) 
 Gonna twerk it out 
 Ah baby 
 Let me tell you how 
 What do you think about me 
 Twerkin' it from your 
 Front to your back 
 And kickback 
 Relax come sit 
 Here on my lap, shorty 
 Tonight I'm takin' you 
 All the way 
 Won't stop until you 
 Scream my name 
 Repeat chorus twice 
 Morning is coming and 
 I don't want to let you go 
 Let's just lay her in this 
 Bed of red rose pedals 
 I know that we spent 
 But one kiss 
 Could make this start 
 All over again 
 If you want it baby 
 Come with me 
 It's way to trill the way 
 You making it feel 
 The way you twerkin' is 
 Oh so sexy 
 Oh baby, you sure 
 Love the part 
 It's way to trill the way 
 You making it feel 
 The way you twerkin' is 
 Oh so sexy 
 Oh baby you sure 
 Love the part 
 Repeat chorus twice 
 Let me twerk it 
 I won't hurt it 
 Damn the club tonight girl 
 Let's work it out 
 Let me work it 
 I won't hurt it 
 I know you like when 
 I do you like that 
 Just work it out 
 Repeat chorus to fade
