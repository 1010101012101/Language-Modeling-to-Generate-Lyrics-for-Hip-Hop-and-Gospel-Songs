Sweet Lies Lyrics 
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa (why you lie to me) 
 Whoa whoa whoa (you was everything I needed) 
 Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa (I can't go on) (I gotta know when it is true) 
 Sweet lies, girl (listen) 
 (Verse one) 
 My stomach aches and sweat in my palms 
 This is so sudden (what I'm supposed to do?) 
 I thought that love calls between our hearts 
 We're truly touching (be careful what you ask for) 
 (B-Section) 
 One day I'll meet that special girl 
 Just for me 
 She'll have open ears 
 She won't ignore me 
 I'll bet I'll meet some special girl 
 She'll save the day 
 And she'll get it (oh) 
 When I say girl 
 I don't wanna go on 
 In this life 
 Wondering why (baby why) 
 Why (baby why) 
 I'd rather the bitter truth 
 When it comes to you (when it come to you) 
 Than those sweet lies 
 Lies (sweet lies) 
 (Verse Two) 
 Why oh why this song 
 Don't you love me (I love you, put that on everything) 
 Well maybe where I went wrong 
 Was callin' you honey (shorty, shawty, don't matter) 
 (B-Section) 
 One day I'll meet that special girl (special girl) 
 Just for me (just for me) 
 She'll have open ears (open ears) 
 She won't ignore me 
 I'll bet I'll meet some special girl (special girl) 
 She'll save the day (she'll save the day) 
 And she'll get it (oh) 
 When I say girl 
 I don't wanna go on 
 In this life 
 Wondering why (baby why) 
 Why (baby why) 
 I'd rather the bitter truth 
 When it comes to you (when it comes to you) 
 Than those sweet lies 
 Lies (sweet lies) 
 Oh (what I'm supposed to do) 
 Oh (sit around herea ll day thinking about this) 
 (Man please) 
 Oh (I'm lacing up my bathing apes) 
 Then I'm out 
 I'm out to night 
 You'll see 
 I bet it was sweet on your lips 
 When you told me (let me show you) 
 Ayay (it hurt me) 
 My heart is just twisting slowly 
 (I let you do) no one to hold me 
 (B-Section) 
 One day I'll meet that special girl (special girl) 
 Just for me (just for me) 
 She'll have open ears (open ears) 
 She won't ignore me 
 I'll bet I'll meet some special girl (special girl) 
 She'll save the day (she'll save the day) 
 And she'll get it (oh) 
 When I say girl (OH) 
 I don't wanna go on 
 In this life 
 Wondering why (baby why) 
 Why (baby why) 
 I'd rather the bitter truth 
 When it comes to you (why is comes to you) 
 Than those sweet lies 
 Lies (sweet lies)
