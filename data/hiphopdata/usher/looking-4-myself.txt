Walking with my head down 
 Counting every step 
 Hoping that the next one 
 Brings me, closer to the man I was 
 'Cause I was way better 
 Baby it's because 
 We were, together 
 I say I'm looking for myself 
 And I still can't find me 
 That's why I'm looking for myself 
 Who am I, someone remind me 
 I'm looking for myself 
 All my life I'm searching 
 I say I'm looking for myself 
 And somehow I... where are you to... 
 Oeh oeh oehoe, looking for myself 
 Oeh oeh oehoe, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, oeh oeh oehoe, looking for myself 
 And somehow, I ran right into you 
 Escaping on the... 
 Trying not to fall 
 If I don't keep my balance 
 I know that I will lose it all 
 I, I should've known better 
 And it's all my fault 
 That we're not together 
 I say I'm looking for myself 
 And I still can't find me 
 That's why I'm looking for myself 
 Who am I, someone remind me 
 I'm looking for my self 
 All my life I'm searching 
 I say I'm looking for myself 
 And somehow I... where are you to... 
 Oeh oeh oehoe, looking for myself 
 Oeh oeh oehoe, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, oeh oeh oehoe, looking for myself 
 And somehow, I ran right into you 
 Girl, I was on a journey 
 Trying to figure out who I really was 
 Than I realized that 
 You're not here 
 Half of me is gone 
 So in order for me to find me 
 I had to find you, you know 
 And I gotta funny feeling that 
 You won't know who you are 
 Unless you find me 
 It's like you look in the mirror 
 And you see the person that you truly love 
 I say I'm looking for myself 
 And I still can't find me 
 That's why I'm looking for myself 
 Who am I, someone remind me 
 I'm looking for myself 
 All my life I'm searching 
 I say I'm looking for myself 
 And somehow I... where are you to... 
 Turn the lights on 
 Oeh oeh oehoe, looking for myself 
 Oeh oeh oehoe, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, oeh oeh oehoe, looking for myself 
 And somehow, I ran right into you 
 Oeh oeh oehoe, looking for myself 
 Oeh oeh oehoe, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, oeh oeh oehoe, looking for myself 
 And somehow, I ran right into you
