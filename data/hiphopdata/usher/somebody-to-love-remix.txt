Ooh ah 
 For you I'd write a symphony 
 I'd tell the violin 
 It's time to sink or swim 
 Watch 'em play for ya 
 For you I'd be (oh whoa) 
 Runnin' a thousand miles 
 Just get to where you are 
 Step to the beat of my heart 
 I don't need a whole lot 
 Coming for you I admit I'd 
 Rather give you the world 
 Or we can share mine 
 I know I won't be the first one 
 Giving you all this attention 
 Baby listen 
 I just need somebody to love 
 I, I don't need too much 
 Just somebody to love 
 (Somebody to love) 
 I don't need nothing else 
 I promise girl I swear 
 I just need somebody to love 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 (Usher Part) 
 Every day I bring the sun around 
 Sweep away the clouds 
 Smile for me (smile for me) 
 I would take every second every single time 
 Spend it like my last dime 
 Step to the beat of my heart 
 I don't need a whole lot 
 Coming for you I admit I'd 
 Rather give you the world 
 Or you can share mine 
 I know I won't be the first one 
 Giving you all this attention 
 So baby listen 
 I just need somebody to love (oh no no no no no no) 
 I, I don't need too much 
 Just somebody to love 
 (Somebody to love) 
 I don't need nothing else 
 I promise girl I swear 
 I just need somebody to love 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 Somebody to love 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 I just need somebody to love 
 And you can have it all 
 Anything you want I can bring 
 Give you the finer things (yeah) 
 But what I really want I can't find 
 Cause money can't find me 
 Somebody to love (oh whoa) 
 Find me somebody to love (oh whoa) 
 I need somebody to love (yeah) 
 I, I don't need too much 
 Just somebody to love 
 (Somebody to love) 
 I don't need nothing else 
 I promise girl I swear 
 I just need somebody to love 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 Somebody to love 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 I swear I just need somebody to love 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody) 
 (I need somebody I, I need somebody to love) 
 Is she out there? 
 Is she out there? 
 Is she out there? 
 Is she out there? 
 I just need somebody to love
