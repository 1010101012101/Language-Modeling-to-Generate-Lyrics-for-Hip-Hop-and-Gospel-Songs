Ooh no no, no no no no'. 
 I got two-dozen roses, and a card that 
 Says baby I can't wait to see you later 
 We made dinner reservations, at NOBU, 
 Mr. Chow, you just pick the location. 
 Now we're sitting at the table sippin' the 
 Finest wine having a damn good time 
 I know what's on your mind' I want you, 
 You want me too stop frontin' I know exactly 
 What you would you wanna do 
 Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch 
 My body baby, body baby 
 Do it to me I guarantee you won't regret 
 It let me set it out like you ain't never had it 
 Do it to me I want you to grab me talk to 
 Me tell me how you like it when you want 
 It when you all up on it ooh 
 Do it to me I'm gonna give it to you, I'm 
 Gonna make this a night to remember 
 Watchin' you work the stick in the ride, 
 The motion how you move from 3rd to 5 
 And imagine what it's gona be when we get inside 
 And you put that ooh wee on me and you 
 Want me the same way, ooh I can't wait 
 I'm tired of thinkin' about it, speakin' about it, 
 Baby it's time to be about it, turn off the lights, 
 Take off your 
 Clothes, jump in the bed, and let it flow 
 Squeeze and holdin' bitin' scratchin' spankin' 
 Screamin' pullin' my hair when you need 
 Me everything goes'baby when you'. 
 So long I waited for this night to get 
 Inside you look in your eyes and tell you 
 Baby take me I'm yours 
 And if you feel anything like I feel, by the 
 End of the night I'm certain you'll be screamin' 
 For more 
 I wanna do anything and everything to your 
 Body till you break down can't take no more 
 From the bed to the floor, to the top of the stairs 
 You gona get it baby please please ooh DO IT TO ME 
 (Thanks to Mia)
