All my ladies say, ha, ha, ho 
 All my ladies say, ha, ha, ho 
 All my ladies say, ha, ha, ho 
 All my ladies stay down, stay down 
 Stay down, stay down, stay down 
 Stay down, stay down, stay down, stay down 
 Never would believe, if I cheat 
 Could you be the one that's strong enough 
 For us to withstand our love? Yeah 
 If they started spreading rumors about me 
 Would you believe or would you heard and disregard 
 Be a goddess and stand by my side, down to ride 
 I don't need someone that's over protective 
 Too possessive, no 
 That would be the one that's gonna push me away 
 Here what I'm saying 
 I need someone that's independent 
 But play the position, yeah 
 No women need to know what not to say 
 Don't you hear what I'm saying? 
 If you with me then you gotta 
 Stay down, stay down, stay down 
 Stay down, stay down 
 You gotta stay down, stay down 
 Stay down, stay down, stay down
