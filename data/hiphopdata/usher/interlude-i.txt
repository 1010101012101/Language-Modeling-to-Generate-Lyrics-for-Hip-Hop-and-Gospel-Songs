Love, such a lonely place 
 Nobody wants to be alone 
 To have the world, who your willin' to share with 
 I am so alone, 
 I can't stand this feeling of being without you, 
 I'll do whatever it takes to prove I truly love you, 
 Don't, let me go, lets stay together, forever, and ever, can't sleep without you by my side
