Featuring Mike Jones 
 (Usher) 
 Yeah 
 If you only knew 
 I already sized you up 
 Sittin' next to me lookin' so tough 
 And your fixin' your hair runnin' your game 
 Tellin' me I only want one thing girl 
 Sincerity's what you need for now 
 In a while the truth will all come out 
 And its almost unfair to me 
 What you wanna say baby ready to see 
 It's so clear to me 
 It's that everyone will hear you speaking 
 Whatever I wanna do 
 Its whatever I wanna do 
 Whatever I want I can do to you 
 Whatever I want I can do to you 
 Whatever you say is just givin' me well 
 Whatever I want baby I can do 
 Whatever I want 
 (Usher) 
 You can't get enough 
 Man, conversation I can feel your touch 
 You losin' points trying to play the role 
 Let's keep it cool nonsexual 
 Girl I know how you feel 
 But you don't want it for real 
 It's whatever I wanna do 
 You don't even know what you got into 
 (Usher) 
 It just ain't right 
 You feelin'so frustrated 
 You can' stop the feeling 
 The feeling is close to me 
 Girl you know that Everything you need is right here 
 So now when we do whatever we want to (oh yeah) 
 Whatever I Want 
 (Mike Jones)

 Whatever I need 
 She'll do whatever it takes to give it to me 
 She don't trip, don't fall 'cause she know I'll kick her out 
 And when I get bored bring her back to my house 
 I'm Mike Jones 
 Who? Mike Jones 
 Hitta chick quick and make her walk home 
 'Cause whatever I want to do I'ma do to you 
 I'm a grown man so I do what I wanna do 
 So until you figure it out 
 I'm kickin' you out 
 Because I feel good single 
 I don't need no spouse 
 I'm a bachelor who just got his Bachelor's Degree
