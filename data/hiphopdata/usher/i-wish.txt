Do you know, what I think about all these night. 
 When I can't sleep, sleep at all. 
 Oh slowly, I close my eyes. 
 My thoughts they fly away to you no matter what I do. 
 And I wish, I could turn back time, 
 Back to the time when you were mine. 
 I wish, I wish the day, the day you went away, 
 Never happened a-baby 
 I wish the stars, the stars in the heaven would come down to me, 
 So I could give them to you and tell me then would you be loving 
 Me, like I wish 
 And it's so hard, when you love someone this much, 
 But you just don't know how, how to love him the right way 
 If you could see, what you've done to me, 
 What you've done to my heart, what you've done to my soul baby 
 All of my mind and all of my body, then you should have known 
 Why I can't let it go and baby I, 
 I wish the day, the day you went away never happened a-baby, 
 I wish the stars, the stars in the heaven, would come down to me 
 So I could give them to u, and tell me then would you be, loving me 
 Like I wish 
 I don't know what you want me to do, 
 To prove me love is a-real for a-you, 
 I don't know what you want me to say baby, 
 There is no ifs or maybes, 
 All I want is you, 'cause baby you are my only wish 
 Ooh my only wish
