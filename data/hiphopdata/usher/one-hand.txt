Me and my baby had the worst kinda fight 
 A lotta dirt slung up when she hung up 
 I could tell somethin' in her voice wasn't right 
 Booked at [? ] at last minute, 4am and she ain't home 
 Start dialin' up her digits, she ain't answerin' the phone 
 See headlights in my blinds, I'm losin' my mind 
 6:45 in the mornin', what's goin' on 
 Don't come up in here lyin' 
 She said, "Sit down, now baby, we need to talk" 
 She told me there was somebody else 
 And I had it coming 
 It was that room in Cancun 
 That stack of chips in Vegas 
 That college dorm in Georgia 
 That'll forever remain nameless 
 I know I got no right to judge you but it really hurts 
 And knowin' I deserve it makes it worst 
 Can't count the times I did you wrong on one hand 
 Can't count the times I made you cry on one hand 
 I know I told one too many lies 
 Never thought it'd turn around on me 
 Let's call it even and I won't up and leave 
 I can count the times you did me wrong on one hand 
 I can count the times you made me cry on one hand 
 Every man you ever gave your love on one hand 
 Oh no, on one hand (On one hand) 
 Breathin' heavy, heartbeat thumpin' so fast 
 I gotta know right now, put it all out on the table 
 Brace myself before I ask 
 I'm a need places, names, and numbers 
 Scratch that- tell me where he stay 
 For the [? ] said be careful where you lay 
 Man, I thought you let him go 
 You best let me know 
 How many days, how many ways did he hit that 
 Did he make my queen his hoe? 
 She said "What's done is done" 
 {Couldn't think of nothing bad enough to call her? } 
 Guess I had it coming 
 Oh, it was that room in Cancun 
 That stack of chips in Vegas 
 That college dorm in Georgia 
 That will forever remain nameless 
 I know I got no right to judge you but it really hurts 
 And knowin' I deserve it makes it worst 
 Can't count the times I did you wrong on one hand 
 Can't count the times I made you cry on one hand 
 I know I told one too many lies 
 Never thought it'd turn around on me 
 Let's call it even and I won't up and leave 
 I can count the times you did me wrong on one hand 
 I can count the times you made me cry on one hand 
 Every man you ever gave your love on one hand 
 Oh no, on one hand (On one hand) 
 Don't know what to do 
 Try to forgive and forget 
 But if I do, I know I look like a fool 
 I did my dirt, and I made you hurt 
 How the hell you turn it around and switch on me 
 (Switch it on me) 
 Go with the first in mind, and kick it 
 I can't guarantee it won't happen again 
 I can't let it go, but if I do 
 For this day forward, we gotta promise to keep it on 
 No, baby 
 Can't count the times I did you wrong on one hand 
 Can't count the times I made you cry on one hand 
 I know I told one too many lies 
 Never thought it'd turn around on me 
 Let's call it even and I won't up and leave 
 I can count the times you did me wrong on one hand 
 I can count the times you made me cry on one hand 
 Every man you ever gave your love on one hand 
 Oh no, on one hand (On one hand)
