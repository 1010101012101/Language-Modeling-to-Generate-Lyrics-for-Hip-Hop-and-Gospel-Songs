I love the way you dirty type 
 I can take you home on escape 
 I need your backspace in my life 
 Thank God, you don't have a flat screen 
 Please baby, I got to see you 
 And I really wanna please you 
 So get on my laptop, so I can download 
 Online, I love the way you log on 
 We can do it all night, I'll make you dot com 
 Baby, if you sign on, I'ma make you lights off 
 Baby, if you log on, I'll make you dot com 
 I wanted to link up with you, baby at first sight 
 With you I get to use my F keys 
 I can't wait to give you megabytes 
 I got all the memory you'll need 
 Let my fingers do the talking 
 Please baby, I got to see you 
 And I really wanna please you 
 So get on my laptop, so I can download 
 Online, I love the way you log on 
 We can do it all night, I'll make you dot com 
 Baby, if you sign on, I'ma make you lights off 
 Baby, if you log on, I'll make you dot com 
 Baby, you want this I know 
 I can't wait to give you my hard drive 
 My moonlight, if It's alright, baby 
 I'm always at your window 
 Ready to shift and control you 
 If you want me to say yes, baby 
 Say yes baby, say yes baby 
 Say yes baby, got to say 
 Say yes baby, say yes baby 
 You got to say yes, yes 
 Please, baby I got to see you 
 And I really wanna please you 
 So get on me baby, get up on me, oh

 We can do it all night, I'll make you dot com 
 Baby, if you sign on, I'ma make you lights off 
 Baby, if you log on, I'll make you dot com
