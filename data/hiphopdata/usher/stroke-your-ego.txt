It's cool, you got a job and everything 
 But you know it ain't the money that made me look 
 Let's just keep it real babe 
 I could give a damn about the way you cook 
 You need a little motivation baby 
 Lemme pour a little liquid courage Off in your cup 
 Ain't lookin' for nothing too serious 
 Can you put it down, every time you give it up 
 'Cause you're so focused on your fashion 
 And everything you own 
 Yeah, you're independent but you're spending nights alone 
 I can satisfy ya, ecstasy and fire 
 So let's assume I'm takin' you home 
 And then I'll... 
 Stroke your ego 
 Seems like that's what you need 
 Stroke your ego 
 I'll give you pleasure indeed 
 Stroke your ego 
 I'll make you feelin' like never before 
 Got what you want, and what you need 
 Leave it to me 
 And I'll stroke you all night long 
 Acting like a diva babe 
 It might be cute, but it ain't gonna get you much 
 I'll sink my ship in your ocean baby 
 Never mind the lotion let's touch 
 'Cause you're so focused on that fashion 
 And diamonds and flashy things 
 You say you're independent, but really what does that mean 
 I can satisfy ya, I'll ignite your fire 
 But only if you're coming with me 
 Then Ima... 
 Stroke your ego 
 Seems like that's what you need 
 Stroke your ego 
 I'll give you pleasure indeed 
 Stroke your ego 
 I'll make you feelin' like never before 
 Got what you want, and what you need 
 Leave it to me 
 And I'll stroke you all night long 
 You're self sufficient baby, you need attention girl 
 I see it's something you crave, crave 
 And I just won't have it, now put away that rabbit 
 'Cause I can do it better than anyone 
 So let me... 
 Stroke your ego 
 Seems like that's what you need 
 Stroke your ego 
 I'll give you pleasure indeed 
 Stroke your ego 
 I'll make you feelin' like never before 
 Got what you want, and what you need 
 Leave it to me 
 And I'll stroke you all night long
