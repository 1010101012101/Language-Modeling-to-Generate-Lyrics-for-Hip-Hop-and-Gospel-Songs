Ah, ooh, 
 I think its time to cutter off 
 Cut cut cutter off 
 'Cause she be confrontin me 
 Askin me where I wanna be 
 Its time to cutter off 
 Cut cut cutter off 
 She always grabbin me 
 Sayin' "Look what you've done to me!" 
 I think its time to cutter cutter cutter cutter off 
 I think its time to cutter cutter cutter cutter off 
 Attitude has placed apart your past 
 And to me, I think that's real inside 
 You be actin' so harsh and so mean 
 Insecurity and drama you wanna bring 
 Checkin' my mail checkin' my phone 
 Sayin' you don't wanna be alone 
 My music is the way I live 
 Oh yeah! I love this life I live 
 I think its time to cutter off 
 Cut cut cut cutter off 
 'Cause she be confrontin me 
 Askin me where I wanna be 
 Its time to cutter off, 
 Cut cut cutter off 
 She always grabbin me 
 Sayin' "Look what you've done to me!" 
 I think its time to cutter cutter cutter cutter off 
 I think its time to cutter cutter cutter cutter off 
 Heeeey! 
 Now this is not another woman hate song 
 I'm talkin' to you and you alone 
 Not tellin' them 'cause you know her, no 
 But the way you re-acted jus wont go 
 The way you don't take time to let the scars heal 
 It's like I gotta bring edgy cars and that's fo reaaal 
 How can you do like guy folks hit in the past 
 A couple of promises and we just broke that 
 I think its time to cutter off 
 Cut cut cut cutter off 
 'Cause she be confrontin me 
 Askin me where I wanna be 
 Its time to cutter off, cut cut cutter off 
 She always grabbin me 
 Sayin' "Look what you've done to me!" 
 I think its time to cutter cutter cutter cutter off (rides out) 
 I think its time to cutter cutter cutter cutter off x4 
 I think its time to cutter off, cut cut cutter off...
