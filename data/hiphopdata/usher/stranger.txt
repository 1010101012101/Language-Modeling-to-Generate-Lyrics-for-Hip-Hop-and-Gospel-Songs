Drummer Boy 
 Said you'll neva give away your heart again 
 I'll be knockin' till you let me in 
 I know you told me, you'd rather be lonely 
 You don't even know me 
 That's why I no longer wanna be a stranger 
 Sorry you put your trust in others 
 And they let you down 
 And all the the secrets and the unknown evidence 
 Now in the open that you found 
 Cried yourself to sleep so many nights 
 Said you'd never again 
 I'm not the one you hold it against 
 Baby, it's not my plan 
 Yeah, you independent as hell 
 And doin' it by yourself 
 But what you gon' do 
 When the nighttime gets cold? 
 I know you told me, you'd rather be lonely 
 You don't even know me 
 I ain't moving out the way for nothing, I'm stubborn 
 'Cause you said you'd never give away your heart again 
 I'll be knockin' till you let me in 
 I know you told me, you'd rather be lonely 
 Tired of being your closest friend 
 You don't even know me 
 That's why I no longer wanna be a stranger 
 Tell me, what I gotta do, what I gotta do 
 What I gotta do, what I gotta do 
 What I gotta do, what I gotta do, yeah 
 You're stuck inside no matter how hard you try to forget 
 Don't you wish there was a button we could reset 
 And make it easy? 
 But you can't take back the decision that you made to love 
 No, oh, no 
 I know it's the one that you regretting, not so proud of 
 Because you keep tellin' me 
 Yeah, you independent as hell 
 And doin' it by yourself 
 But what you gon' do 
 When the nighttime gets cold? 
 I know you told me, you'd rather be lonely 
 You don't even know me 
 I ain't moving out the way for nothing, I'm stubborn 
 'Cause you said you'd never give away your heart again 
 I'll be knockin' till you let me in 
 I know you told me, you'd rather be lonely 
 Tired of being your closest friend 
 You don't even know me 
 That's why I no longer wanna be a stranger 
 Baby, tell me 
 What I gotta do, what I gotta do 
 What I gotta do 
 Baby, tell me 
 What I gotta do, what I gotta do 
 What I gotta do 
 I remember the break-up 
 And the condition that my heart was in 
 But I would never surrender, no, no 
 I gotta be stronger, there's nothing time can't heal 
 Girl, I know you're scarred 
 All I ask is a chance to come in and do my part 
 It's nothing but fear and you've been holding on since 
 Too under pressure and I see us sinking in 
 Said you'll neva give away your heart again 
 I'll be knockin' till you let me in 
 I know you told me, you'd rather be lonely 
 You don't even know me 
 That's why I no longer wanna be a stranger 
 What I gotta do, what I gotta do 
 What I gotta do, oh 
 What I gotta do, what I gotta do 
 What I gotta do
