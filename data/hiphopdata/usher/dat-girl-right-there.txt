 Trying tell them just what I want

 Ludacris: 
 Say lil momma what it do I got no 
 Time for no faking so let me get 
 Up in it 'cause I'm a beast with it 
 I can hit it from the side to the 
 Back you gonna have to really 
 Get on my level 'cause I'm a freak 
 With it and she's filling the way my plaques hang put you in this range? you with kane? h.u double 
 R to the caine beat it out the frame you already 
 Know my name while we doing our 
 Thing you all over the sheets in the jeep as we freak 
 To the beat like that I'm the best in the game 
 Whoever gor a problem you can holla we can 
 Put a hundred stacks on that you can ride 
 In the jeep or the drop the drop go fast 
 Tell them other duded that I'm passed 
 I beatr it iut the frame like bang bang bang hit it 
 Until she tell me she about to go insane.
