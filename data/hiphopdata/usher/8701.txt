 Man, it's been a long time coming[Incomprehensible] 
 But I never forgot about you 
 I'm here 
 Yeah, we've traveled the world 
 Seen a lot of places, so many faces 
 We had a good time 
 We've grown together 
 Who would've thought 
 We'd stay down this long? 
 This is my chance 
 To share my world with you 
 And I know, you're gonna like it 
 Are you ready?
