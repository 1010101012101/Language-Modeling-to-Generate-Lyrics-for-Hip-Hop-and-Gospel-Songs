 Shawty got a body that jeans can't hold 
 And she moving like she read everything from the pole 
 And she loved to party, number one hobby 
 Out till the morning, better ask somebody 
 Talk to the girl, talk to the one, oh 
 What will happen to you, what she gonna sound 
 Tell her to get up, tell her you hit the ground, oh, oh 
 Gonna face time, see if she's down 
 She's a girl from the future, says she's sick and tired up 
 Oh, oh, so so all can hit the road 
 Many... if you know 
 'Cause she's a hot thing, hot thing 
 Hot thing, hot thing 
 Hot thing 
 What's her bootie? 
 Hot thing

 Hot thing

 She's so... 
 Seen her amazing, she stopped and posed 
 When she seen the green one she just go, go, go 
 Like a... in Bugatti, got money in your pocket 
 That makes you really pop, you really pop a body 
 Talk to the girl, talk to the one, oh 
 What will happen to you, what she gonna sound 
 Tell her to get up, tell her you hit the ground, oh, oh 
 Gonna face time, see if she's down 
 She says you most have money in your wallet so the thing don't fall 
 And this is credit cards... 
 Now you only know what you know 
 For real, she's a hot thing, 
 Hot thing, hot thing

 She's young hot thing, baby lemme cool off 
 GQ status wouldn't fuck me with my suit off 
 She a fashion killer and you know I am a show hog Christin Louboutins red bottoms give me blue balls 
 She fuck me like she know me, 
 And fuck me like she owed me 
 She told me then she showed me, 
 Then she... like she lonely 
 All for the love, for the holly matrimony 
 But I'm pretty like Tony, and I'm pimping like... 
 Hi, hi how are you doing, I'm the... 
 ...'Cause we're running with the flame 
 She a hot girl, so she running with the name 
 Drop, drop it like it's hot, one more thing... 
 Go Nicki Minaj flow when I hit the... 
 If you let me menaj, I'll take you to sea ocean 
 Talk to the girl, talk to the one, oh 
 What will happen to you, what she gonna sound 
 Tell her to get up, tell her you hit the ground, oh, oh 
 Gonna face time, see if she's down 
 She said don't really... get me out of control
