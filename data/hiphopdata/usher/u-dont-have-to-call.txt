Yo, after tonight 
 Don't leave your girl 'round me 
 True playa for real 
 Ask my nigga Pharrell 
 Situations will arise 
 In our lives 
 But you gotta be smart about it 
 Celebrations with the guys 
 I sacrificed 
 'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it 
 Meanwhile I... 
 I loved you 
 You were my girl 
 You see I... 
 Thought the world of you 
 But you're still steady leavin' baby 
 You don't have to call 
 It's okay girl 
 'Cause I'ma be all right tonight 
 Aw, girl 
 Your face is saying why 
 Tears in eyes 
 Should've been more smart about it 
 Should've cherished me 
 Listenin' to friends 
 Now it's the endin' 
 Then again, no story can end without it 
 Damn I... 
 I loved you 
 You were my girl 
 You see I... 
 Thought the world of you 
 But you're still steady leavin' baby 
 Gonna boogie tonight 
 'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy 
 To stay home 
 Waiting for love 
 So tonight 
 I'm gonna do what a single man does 
 And that's party 
 (Oh yeah 
 I'm numb) 
 It's OK, girl 
 Sick and tired of staying at home 
 I'm gonna have me some fun 
 Hey, hey 
 It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's all right 
 I'm not waiting at home for you 
 Bye-bye
