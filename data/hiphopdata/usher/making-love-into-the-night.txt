 Baby, I can come by and pick you up 
 We'll make love into the night, it's never enough 
 Oh babe, I know what you like 
 And I would make love to you forever and ever into the night 
 Forever and ever, we'll make love into the night 
 Your wish is my command 
 So I'll cancel my plans tonight, yeah, oh baby, yeah 
 I'll make you understand that I'm the only one 
 Who can handle your body right 
 And I'ma show you tonight, ooh wait, baby, I'm coming 
 Baby, I can come by and pick you up 
 We'll make love into the night, it's never enough 
 Oh babe, I know what you like 
 And I would make love to you forever and ever into the night 
 Forever and ever we'll make love into the night 
 If you ever wanna know who I love 
 That's you, that's you, it's you, yes you

 You gonna wanna tell everybody 
 'Bout how I got you all, coming when I call 
 You know I break you off 
 And if these walls could talk they would tell everybody 
 'Bout how I put it down, you know I shut you down 
 Got you up off the ground, yes, I can't be wasted 
 If I let you on my spaceship, you'll have to let me taste it 
 Hop on it, I'ma give you a ride 
 'Cause we gonna make love all through the night
