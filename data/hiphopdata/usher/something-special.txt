Oh No No 
 Ooh... 
 Yeah Yeah Yeah 
 Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 
 This one's for the lovers 
 Follow me 
 Clearly, this is new for me 
 Get excited when you're here, my dear 
 Make no mistake you are all I see, sugar 
 My vision's never been so clear 
 We both know that I been runnin' so long 
 This time I won't let me leave 
 Please be patient 
 Hesitation aside 
 We're almost where we need to be 
 But in the meantime, let me say what's on my mind 
 Baby, I... 
 I think we've got somethin' special 
 Girl, you and me 
 Together, we'll take over the world 
 You know I love ya 
 I need you so 
 So happy I just wanna let everybody know 
 Think back to the time 
 When I was scared to let it show 
 Havin' too much fun with this and that one 
 Now that you're mine (huh yeah..) 
 Somewhere along the way, everything fell in place 
 Ooh... I'm so proud of how you represent me, baby 
 Whether rockin' Armani, Dolce Gabbana, Roberto Cavalli, Louis, or Gucci, girl 
 No matter what you wear, you do your own wit it 
 I'll feel the same years from here 
 But in the meantime, let me say what's on my mind 
 Ooh... listen 
 I think we've got somethin' special 
 Girl, you and me 
 Together, we'll take over the world 
 You know I love ya 
 I need you so 
 So happy I just wanna let everybody know 
 That I think we've got somethin' special 
 Girl, you and me 
 Together, we'll take over the world 
 You know I love ya 
 I need you so 
 So happy I just wanna let everybody know 
 You know I need ya, baby (I love you) 
 Girl, you know (repeat x 3) 
 Do you know I need ya, baby (repeat x 4) 
 Girl, now that you're mine 
 Somewhere along the way, everything fell in place 
 Hey... 
 I think we've got somethin' special 
 Girl, you and me 
 Together, we'll take over the world 
 You know I love ya 
 I need you so 
 So happy I just wanna let everybody know 
 I think we've got somethin' special 
 Girl, you and me 
 Together, we'll take over the world 
 You know I love ya 
 Girl, I need you so 
 I'll never, never let you go 
 No... 
 You're so special
