(Omarion) 
 I don't know 
 Should I stay 
 Should I go 
 Yeah, I know 
 It's the remix, remix 
 Yeah 
 See I'm in this situation 
 Think I need a little help 
 Let's go 
 When this began, we were friends 
 She knew all my business (business) 
 All my good, all my bad 
 Said that she was with it (now) 
 I got memories, this is crazy 
 She ain't nothing like that girl I used to know 
 Didn't believe she would creep 
 Thought we was forever (oh) 
 She broke out, I broke down 
 And that's just all that left of us (oh) 
 Now these memories, they be haunting me 
 You ain't feeling me 
 My girl's about to go 
 And I really wanna work this out 
 'Cause I'm tired of fighting (if that don't work) & 
 I really hope she still want me the way I want her (you'll get your feelings hurt) 
 I said I really wanna work this out 
 Damn girl I'm trying 
 Here's the remix (remix) 
 I got this ice box where my heart used to be [2x] but (said) 
 I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold (oh) 
 I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold 
 (Repeat) 
 (Usher - Verse 2) 
 Ha pimping listen 
 Hold up now 
 Take your time 
 Let me get this right (huh) 
 You tripping on what's in front of you 
 'Cause you're looking behind you (yeah but I mean) 
 You got memories (but) 
 Take it from me (cause) 
 She ain't nothing like oh girl you used to know 
 If shawty's doing right by you 
 Maybe you should let it go 
 At the end of the day, 
 It ain't worth it 
 Wanna know how I know (how you know) 
 Remember confessions 
 So you already know that it's gonna hurt 
 Shawty, learn your lesson 
 You don't really wanna feel the burn 
 No, listen 
 If you really wanna work it out 
 Then stop denying (denying) 
 Quit living in the past of time 
 You face the truth (truth) 
 If it's ever gonna work out 
 You gotta stop lying 
 Stop blaming her when it's you, that's 
 Got the ice box where your heart used to be 
 Got a ice box where your heart used to be 
 (Omarion) 
 I'm so cold I'm so cold I'm so cold I'm so cold (oh) 
 I'm so cold I'm so cold I'm so cold 
 [Usher] Boy you gotta ice box 
 (Repeat) 
 (Omarion) 
 I don't wanna be stuck off in this cold cold world 
 Don't wanna mess this up 
 Better keep your eye on me, girl 
 (Usher) 
 Leave the past in the past 
 Gotta let it go (say bra) 
 You gotta know when to move on (say bra) 
 You gotta know when to let go (yes sir) 
 Don't lose ya lady 
 (Repeat) 
 This is the remix 
 This is the remix 
 Go ahead replay it 
 This is the remix

 Girl, I really wanna work this out
