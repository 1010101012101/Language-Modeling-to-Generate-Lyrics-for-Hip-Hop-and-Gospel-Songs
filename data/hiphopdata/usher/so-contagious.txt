(Ron isley aka mr. biggs) 
 Its two am just getting in about to check my message, 
 No one has called but my homies and some bill collectors, 
 You say you bring somebody wants to borrow money, 
 I two way her she don't hit me back something is funny, 
 So I called her mother's house and asked her had she had seen my baby 
 Drove my six around look for that missin' lady, 
 Got back in turned the TV on and caught the news 
 Then I put my hand on my head 'cause I'm so confused, 
 And then I turned the TV down, 
 'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound, 
 Umm... something's going on upstairs, 
 'Cause I know nobody's else lives here, 
 As I get closer to the stairways, 
 All I hear and then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, 
 Your contagious touch me baby, 
 Get me what you got, 
 Then a man said, 
 Sexy lady, drive me crazy, 
 Drive me wild, 
 And I just can't believe this shit, 
 I ran down stairs look in the closet lookin' for that eeww... 
 Said a prayer cause only God know what I'm gonna do, 
 What I saw was enough to drive a preacher wild, 
 I'm in the hall contemplate not in my own dame house, 
 Who would have thought she was creeping with another man, 
 But down low happen to me all over again, 
 And then I turned the TV down, 
 'Cause I thought I heard a squeaky sound, 
 Umm. something's going on up there upstairs, 
 'Cause I know nobody's else lives here, 
 As I get closer to the stairways, 
 All I hear and then I hear my baby's voice in my ear, screaming 
 Your contagious touch me baby, 
 Get me what you got, 
 Sexy lady, drive me crazy, (then I heard another man) 
 Drive me wild, 
 And I just can't believe this shit,
