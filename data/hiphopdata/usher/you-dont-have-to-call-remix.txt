Yo after tonight, don't leave your girl around me 
 True playa for real ask my nigga Pharrell 
 Man I'm a playa girl you don't have to call 
 Six gees in my socks so I have to ball 
 Luda, without words I'll let the beat break her 
 Then hit the liquor store and them switzer sweet makers 
 Yeah, me and some friendly friend friends 
 Close as the hairs on my chinney chin, chin 
 I'm a be aight tonight we down south 
 But I plan to get head straight up like Alfalfa 
 Situations will arise in our lives 
 But you got to be smart about it 
 Celebrations, with the guys, I sacrificed 
 'Cause I knew you could not sleep without it 
 Meanwhile I, I, I, I, I, I loved you, you were my girl 
 You see I, I, I, I, I thought the world of you 
 But your so steady still leavin', baby 
 You don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'ma be all right tonight 
 You don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'ma be all right tonight 
 Aw girl your face is, sayin' why 
 Tears in eyes, should've been more smart about it 
 Should've cherished me, listenin' to friends, now it's the end 
 And again no story can end without it 
 Damn right, I loved you, you were my girl 
 You see I, I, I, I, I thought the world of you 
 But you're so steady still leavin' baby 
 You don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'ma be all right tonight 
 You don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'ma be all right tonight 
 Gonna boogie tonight 
 'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy 
 To stay home, waitin' for love 
 So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does 
 Damn what's with all the long faces? 
 You're lookin' for love in all the wrong places 
 Let's hit clubs and girls will take a shirt off 
 If not for me for the raspberry Smirnoff 
 Then me and Usher can knock 'em all 
 Then we up and disappear like socks and draws 
 A town, hit the block and get rowdy 
 We puttin' up A's like Summa Cum Laude 
 Yeah, I graduated at the top of the class 
 And yeah, I strap a harnest to the top of yo ass 
 And I told 'em before the parties don't stop 
 So like Ripley's you believe it or not 
 And when you don't realize I'm the best ya had 
 Now you sittin' at home and you got it bad 
 Yo, I'm a get mine and move slow 
 So drink some prune juice and let the shit go 
 And that's party 
 You don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'ma be all right tonight 
 You don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'ma be all right tonight 
 You don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'ma be all right tonight 
 I'm all right, gonna boogie tonight 
 'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy 
 To stay home, waitin' for love 
 So tonight, I'm gonna do what a single man does 
 And that's party 
 You don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'ma be all right tonight 
 You don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'ma be all right tonight 
 You don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'ma be all right tonight 
 You don't have to call, it's okay girl 
 'Cause I'ma be all right tonight
