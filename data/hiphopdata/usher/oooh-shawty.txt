The room is hot as hell 
 I hope that dress don't veil right over your body baby 
 Look so good you're very well 
 Ooh what's underneath, girl I can tell (it's hard to hide it baby) 
 Come on! ooh, girl come here 
 There's no need to be afraid of what you feel 
 Ooh shawty, good God almighty now what we got here (touchin all over) 
 I like the way you feel 
 Ooh shawty don't hurt nobody with what we got here (ooh baby come closer) 
 'Cause I like the way you feel 
 The way her body moves 
 My Lord, (oh) I've never seen before (it's so erotic) 
 She put me up on somethin' new and then 
 She said "boy let me do what I do" 
 Baby come on! ooh baby come here (baby come here) 
 There's no need to be afraid of what you feel 
 Ooh shawty, good God almighty now what we got here (touchin all over) 
 I like the way you feel 
 Ooh shawty don't hurt nobody with what we got here (ooh baby come closer) 
 'Cause I like the way you feel 
 When I see you doin' what you do 
 Your body's invitin me tellin' me to 
 Move you close and whisper in your ear 
 Ooh keep it right there, don't you go nowhere 
 Ooh shawty, good God almighty now what we got here (got here, touchin all over)

 Ooh shawty, good God almighty now what we got here (touchin all over)
