Oh can you hear me baby 
 Can you hear me baby? 
 Listen... 
 You know everybody is always talking about change 
 Now don't get me wrong 
 Change can be beautiful 
 Something is just still the same you know 
 If this were our last night 
 Here on this planet 
 How would you feel 
 What would you say 
 Pretend that you never 
 Ever will see me 
 After tonight, after today 
 And I tell me you rather fight 
 And hold the grudge against me 
 Instead of makin' love tonight 
 Ooh is that what you sayin' baby 
 I never be flawless 
 Never be perfect 
 No matter how bad you want me to be 
 I'll be your hero 
 As soon as you let go 
 And stop having me in your fantasy 
 Lets just live life 
 Lets just have fun 
 Maybe inside we can be as one 
 But if we never do then that's okay 
 All that I'm trying to say is 
 I ain't gonna change (oh no) 
 Just beein someone else is too damn hard 
 And I don't want you to change (oh no) 
 'Cause I take you just the way you are 
 And ooh, I never wanted anything more 
 And I didn't understand before - but now I do 
 All that I ask is, just be you 
 Now what if tomorrow came and I change 
 And you started doing things that you claim 
 Would be better, what if I did whatever 
 To push the ease that we'd always be together 
 Would that make you satisfied 
 To have me home every night 
 No way that I really missed the lights 
 Could you live with yourself 
 If that'd happen babe 
 Tell me where is the girl 
 The one who used to standin 
 As the light in my world 
 Where is she at 
 'Cause I want her back 
 Can we go back 
 Cause who I'm looking at 
 Forgot how to love 
 I want the one that gave me love 
 The one that I could go to 
 Who used to trip on all the little things 
 Baby I'm just sayin' 
 That change ain't alway happy goes 
 I ain't gonna change (oh no) 
 Just beein someone else is too damn hard 
 And I don't want you to change (oh no) 
 'Cause I take you just the way you are 
 And ooh, I never wanted anything more 
 And I didn't understand before - but now I do 
 All that I ask is, just be you 
 I'm not tryna fight 
 I'm just try to grow 
 But in my own time 
 And if you didn't know 
 I care 
 And I don't want nobody but you 
 You gotta let me love you 
 In the way I know 
 I never let you go 
 If you feel the same 
 Baby then I'll stay 
 But don't make me change 
 I ain't gonna change (oh no) 
 Just beein someone else is too damn hard 
 And I don't want you to change (oh no) 
 'Cause I take you just the way you are 
 And ooh, I never wanted anything more 
 And I didn't understand before - but now I do 
 All that I ask is, just be you 
 I ain't gonna change 
 Baby hear me out 
 Girl you make my day 
 You'd all my life 
 I give everything 
 Just to make it right 
 I'm so tired of fighting 
 Every every every every night 
 Never wanted anything more 
 And I didn't understand it before - but now I do 
 All that I ask is, just be you
