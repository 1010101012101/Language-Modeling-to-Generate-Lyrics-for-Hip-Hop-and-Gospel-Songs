(Usher talking on phone) 
 Hello? 
 Yo I'm in the booth I'mma call you right back 
 Nah I just gotta put this one part down I'mma call you back 
 I'm at the studio man what-- 
 Man quit playin' with me man 
 No for real don't play like that 
 Are you--are you serious? 
 How you know? 
 Put that on everything. 
 Damn 
 I'mma call you back 
 I'mma call you back... 
 Everytime I was in L.A. I was with my ex-girlfriend 
 Everytime you called I told you, 
 Baby I'm workin. (No!) 
 I was out doin' my dirt (Oh!) 
 Wasn't thinkin' 'bout you gettin' hurt 
 (I) Was hand in hand in the Beverly Center like man 
 Not givin' a damn who sees me 
 So gone (I know) 
 So wrong (Just listen) 
 Actin' like I didn't have you sittin' at home 
 Thinkin' about me 
 Bein' the good girl that you are 
 But you prolly believe you got a good man 
 A man that never would do the things I'mma 'bout to tell you I've done 
 Brace yourself 
 It ain't good 
 But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else (oh no) 
 (Usher speaking) 
 I know you hate me 
 I know I hurt you 
 But there's more 
 Listen... 
 (Thanks to Katy)
