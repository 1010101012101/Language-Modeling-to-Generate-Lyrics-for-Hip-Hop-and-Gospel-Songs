 Yeah, man 
 Once again, it's on {It's on} 
 You know we had to do it again, right? 
 (Lil' Jon) 
 We had to do it again, 
 Want you to sing to these ladies, man 
 (Usher (with vocalizing)) 
 (Oh-oh-oh-oh) 
 A'ight, so I'm up first? A'ight, lemme have it... 
 (Oh-oh-oh-oh) 
 Let's do it... 
 (1st Verse - Usher) 
 Baby, how ya doin'? 
 Hope that 'cha fine, wanna know what you got in mind tonight, 
 Got me feenin' like Jodeci, girl, I can't leave you alone, 
 Take a shot of this here Patron' and it's gon' be on, 
 V.I.P. done got way too crowded, 
 I'm about to end up callin' it a night, 
 You should holla at 'cha girl, tell her you shakin' the scene, 
 Pull off, beep-beep, shotgun in a GT with me 
 She said, "Oh-oh, I'm ready to ride, yeah," 
 "'Cause once you get inside, you can't change your mind," 
 "Don't mean to sound impatient, but you gotta promise, baby, oh..." 
 (Chorus - Usher) 
 Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby), 
 That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Oh, I gotta know, baby, aw yeah) 
 Tell me again (Make sho' your right, oh, before we leave), 
 That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Oh, oh it's a good look, baby)... 
 (2nd Verse - Ludacris) 
 Look here! 
 Sometime I wanna be your lover, 
 Sometime I wanna be your friend, 
 Sometime I wanna hug ya, 
 Hold hands, slow-dance while the record spins, 
 Opened up your heart 'cause you said I made you feel so comfortable, 
 Used to play back then, now you all grown-up like Rudy Huxtable, 
 I could be your bud, you could beat me up, 
 Play-fight in the dark, then we both make love, 
 I'd do anything just to feel your butt, 
 Why you got me so messed up? 
 I don't know, but you gotta stop trippin', 
 Be a good girl now, turn around, and get these whippings, 
 You know you like it like that, 
 You don't have to fight back, 
 Here's a pillow - bite... that, 
 And I'll be settin' separate plays, 
 So on all these separate days, 
 Your legs can go they separate... ways... 
 (Chorus - Usher) 
 Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby), 
 That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Oh, it's a good look, baby) 
 Tell me again (Tell me over-and-over-and-over again), 
 That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Make sho' you right, before you choose)... 
 (3rd Verse - Lil' Jon) 
 I's been know you fo' a long time (shorty'), 
 But fuckin' never crossed my mind (shorty'), 
 But tonight, I seen sumthin' in ya (shorty), 
 That made me wanna get wit 'cha (shorta'), 
 But You ain't been nuttin' but a friend to me (shorty'), 
 And a nigga never ever dreamed to be (shorty'), 
 Up in here, kissin', huggin', squeezin', touchin' (shorty'), 
 Up in the bathtub, rub-a-dubbin' (shorty'), 
 Are you sure you wanna go this route? (shorty'), 
 Let a nigga know before I pull it out (shorty'), 
 I would never ever cross the line (shorty'), 
 Shorta'let me hear you tell me one mo' time... one mo' time... 
 (Chorus - Usher) 
 Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby), 
 That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Oh, it's a good look, baby) 
 Tell me again (Make sho' you right, oh, before we leave), 
 That we'll be Lovers and Friends (Tell me over-and-over-and-over again)...
