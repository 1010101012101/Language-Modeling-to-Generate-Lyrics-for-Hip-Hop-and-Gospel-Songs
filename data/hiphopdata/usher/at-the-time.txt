Whoa I 
 Probably shouldve let her know ... that 
 It wasn't that serious for me from the jump 
 But I wanna hit it in the worst way... I suppose ooh 
 She?. probably woulda let me go... if 
 She ever found out my M.O ? was to hit it and quit it and let it go 
 But I still wanna hit it in the worsest way possible 
 No 
 But I can't let her know till I get me mine (Can't let her go till I get me mine) 
 At the time 
 I fell in love, man she couldn't be more beautiful 
 At the time 
 Kissing and hugging what more could I ask for 
 But at time 
 See I got mine and she got hers then it was over 
 In the mean time In between time 
 I didn't wanna let her know that 
 I flipped it on the game (2 times) 
 I'm puttin' it on 
 I didn't know what to do 
 'Cause the because the emotional part was through and over with 
 'Cause man I hit it in the worsest way possible... ooh 
 She didn't wanna let me catch my breath ...No 
 She started rubbing the back of my neck 
 You made me wanna hit it in the worsest way once again 
 Ooh 
 Playing hard to get baby you were funny... funny 
 But my heart was feeling a lil something 
 See at the time it was true I was so in love witchu 
 Till I got me me mine 
 But I couldn't let you know
