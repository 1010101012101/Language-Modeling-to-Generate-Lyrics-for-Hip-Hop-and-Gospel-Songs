Two's Company! 
 I'm a fragile girl, who's always lonely. 
 Everything in this world, seems to hurt. 
 Always pain, no more confidence. 
 'Cause my heart beat says all of the words! 
 Yes you know, I'm not afraid to let my feelings show. 
 Two's company, three is a crowd! 
 Never knew what I wanted to do, when they were around. 
 Lost for my words, always in tears 
 But I've learned from the best, I should never run from my tears. 
 Healing from pain, I'll never be the same. 
 And my heart has got opened wounds. 
 I will always! Always feel this way, 
 Yes you know, yes you know, yes you know! 
 Two's company, three is a crowd! 
 Never knew what I wanted to do till you were found! 
 Lost for my words, always in tears. 
 But I've learned, but I've learned, but I've learned from the best, 
 I should never run from my fears! (Sing Slowly towards end)
