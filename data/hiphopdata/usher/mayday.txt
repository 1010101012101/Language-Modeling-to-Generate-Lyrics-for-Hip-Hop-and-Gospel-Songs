Me like it when you spit fire 
 Usher boy give me that hot wire 
 Me like it when you spit fire 
 Usher boy give me that hot fire 
 Me like it when you spit fire 
 Usher boy give me that hot wire 
 Me like it when you spit fire 
 Usher boy give me that hot fire 
 See my covers blown 
 'Cause my Lois Lane 
 She ain't playing the game 
 Losing altitude 
 They tryna change my zone 
 Oh wait a wait a minute 
 Let me put my goggles on 
 They give me all this fame 
 And say it's mine to choose 
 Tryna send me down in flames 
 So what am I to do 
 Something's wrong with my plane 
 I think I'm losing control 
 ? Somebody's shooting from the other side of the globe 
 You took a chance on me when they told you not to 
 Not to (x3) 
 When my plane start going down you were the only one here 
 They told me leave you on the runway but that I can not do 
 Not do (x3) 
 I'm back up in the air and I'm heading for the stars 
 Everybody's running? 
 ? Magazine called me Mr 6 page 
 The way they treating me these days got me space age 
 They tryna ruin me with rumours like they did to Britney 
 But I can't fall? 
 I guess the big part of me is the big score 
 And you gonna get it back when you come to see me on tour 
 Now you gonna put me on a pedestal and give me ? shades 
 'Cause then they try to take it away from me and my stage! 
 You took a chance on me when they told you not to 
 Not to (x3) 
 When my plane start going down you were the only one here 
 They told me leave you on the runway but that I can not do 
 Not do (x3) 
 I'm back up in the air and I'm heading for the stars 
 Everybody's running? 
 When they gone 16 
 The next thing I'm holding you in my arms 
 I never thought that day would come that you would be the one that I would call my boo 
 All my accomplishments and fortunes I wanna share with you 
 No matter if my plane crash, burn, turn to ash 
 I'm in this with you! 
 You took a chance on me when they told you not to 
 Not to (x3) 
 When my plane start going down you were the only one here 
 They told me leave you on the runway but that I can not do 
 Not do (x3) 
 I'm back up in the air and I'm heading for the stars 
 Everybody's running? 
 You took a chance on me when they told you not to 
 Not to (x3) 
 When my plane start going down you were the only one here 
 They told me leave you on the runway but that I can not do 
 Not do (x3) 
 I'm back up in the air and I'm heading for the stars 
 Everybody's running? 
 Yeah 
 Leave us alone
