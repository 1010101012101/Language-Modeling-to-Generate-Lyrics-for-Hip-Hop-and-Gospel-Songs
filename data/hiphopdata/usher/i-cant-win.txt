Oh Oh Oh Yey Eh Yeah YeyEh yeah Uh Uh 
 Do I remind you of the pain 
 That he put you through, girl 
 Is that the reason I'm to blame 
 Before I do it, is it because he treated you badly 
 I always stand accused? Mmmm 
 Protecting yourself from somebody else? I'm not who's hurting you! 
 Girl and it's killing me girl knowing you compare me to him! 
 Always guilty before the sin 
 I can't win, I can't win NO! 
 I'll do anything to prove I love you 
 Baby girl but I refuse to pay for something I didn't do 
 I love you girl! 
 But I refuse to stay paying for his mistakes. 
 Yeah Oh Yeah Yeah 
 He left a scar across your heart 
 I understand girl 
 Don't let his wrongs, 
 Tear us apart, No 
 Girl I'm your man! 
 Just because he did you swear I'm cheating 
 You think I just don't care 
 Why must I do time For another man's crime 
 Girl you know that ain't fair No No 
 And it's killing me girl knowing you compare me to him! 
 Always guilty before the sin 
 I can't win, No I can't win! 
 I'll do anything to prove I love you 
 Baby girl but I refuse to pay for something I didn't do 
 I love you girl! 
 But I refuse to stay... 
 Paying for his mistakes.

 But tell me what does that have to do with me? 
 Trying to show you something real!

 Before you look up and I'll be gone
