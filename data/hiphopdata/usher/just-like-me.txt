(Lil' Kim:) 
 You got it going on what, what 
 You got it going on what, what 
 Come on, come on 
 Strictly fuck with those 6-digit niggas 
 If the first one is a 9 they a buck behind 
 I live my rhyme 
 At the same time can't find myself layin' up 
 If you ain't payin' up 
 Bullets start sprayin' up 
 You know my niggas is sick 
 The game ain't enough 
 For you to run up in this 
 I need stacks of chicks 
 You know dream house money, 
 Shit you just like me so don't start acting funny. 
 (Usher:) 
 Your the kind of girl that makes 
 Everybody feel that your just so damn good, so damn good 
 But your secrets I found out 
 So don't deny what you're about 
 I know the truth you know I do I do 
 Cause... 
 I know you get lonely 
 Just like me 
 And you want it 
 Just like me 
 But act like you don't 
 You know your just like me. 
 I know you get lonely 
 Just like me 
 And you want it 
 Just like me 
 But act like you don't 
 When you know your just like me. 
 (Usher) 
 Quiet is kept you cry for help 
 When no one else is there I bet you touch yourself 
 Does it feel good? 
 Late at night calls, I bet you do it all 
 Anything to get it off 
 But you still persist to front on me. 
 Baby tell me. 
 (Breakdown:) 
 Why oh why do we play this game of chase? 
 When we know we both feel the same way 
 And why do you put me through all these changes? 
 When you know your just free like me 
 Your just like me. 
 (Lil' Kim:) 
 If I had one wish in the world, I swear to God 
 It would be for girls to rock pearls, straight out the oyster 
 Voice your opinion Queen Bee made a million 
 Got mirrors on my ceiling, so I can see it 
 When you head be in between it, if I had a penis 
 I'd be hard that's for real though, niggas start shit, 
 I'd just flash out my dildo, y'all move too quick 
 I thought I'd be memorized by your cocaine bricks 
 And you smoke gray 6, nigga I thought you was a groupie 
 Obsessed fan with my picture in your hooptie 
 You heard my record now you know I'm freaky 
 So you wanna wreck it and you wanna see me 
 How your dreams be, you want me sexual 
 In a gun fight, 2 on 3 
 I'm next to pull, and I love life 
 Something you never could imagine, then you woke the fuck up 
 It's just rappin'. 
 I know you get lonely 
 Just like me 
 And you want it 
 Just like me 
 But act like you don't 
 When you know your just like me. 
 I know you get lonely 
 Just like me 
 And you want it 
 Just like me 
 But act like you don't 
 When you know your just like me. 
 Don't front like your just like me. 
 Just like me 
 Just like me 
 Just like me 
 Just like me 
 Just like me 
 Just like me.
