Usher 
 Say it ain't what you do 'cause... 
 So if you knew what I knew 
 She'd be yours tonight 
 Yeah, baby 
 Imagine she came here to get away 
 She don't want nobody crowing the space 
 Huh, wouldn't that be weird? Oh yeah 
 She was up tonight to get down 
 But she don't wanna be part of the crowd 
 Wouldn't that be weird? Oh yeah 
 I'm so confused 
 If you only knew 
 She came to to give it to you 
 Girl it ain't what you do 
 It's what you do tonight 
 And there ain't no shortcuts 
 In doing something right 
 If you knew what I knew 
 She'd be yours tonight 
 Just look around the club 
 'Cause you're here to have a good time 
 So many benefits to being wild 
 Just be cool, enjoy the ride 
 'Cause all you really wanna do is, wouldn't that be weird? Yeah 
 Don't be stingy with it, pass the J, when I hit it this headache go away 
 Yeah that's weird 
 I'm so confused 
 If you only knew 
 She came to to give it to you 
 Girl it ain't what you do 
 It's what you do tonight 
 And there ain't no shortcuts 
 In doing something right 
 If you knew what I knew 
 She'd be yours tonight 
 Just look around the club 
 'Cause you're here to have a good time 
 Nicki Minaj 
 Yo 
 He want the flirty girl, I'm the girly girl 
 You the one who get the worm it's the early bird flow 
 Slicker than MJ, early curl 
 I got to clip these bitches like sterly sturl 
 I seen him in the club he could get the cub 
 I ain't talking about baseball g-g-get the club 
 Don't be like OJ and forget your glove 
 Tryna get faded, go and get the drug 
 F-f-five plus five what they call that? Ten 
 Out in Japan we be counting that, zen 
 Ladies who you trying popping with? Men 
 No little boys in the circle of Usher 
 Got 'em under pressure 
 When your girl come through Nicki gon' crush her 
 And tell your man play the back like a spine 
 You only last 6 seconds like a vine
