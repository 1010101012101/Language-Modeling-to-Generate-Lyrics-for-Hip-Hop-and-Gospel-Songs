First time I Saw you baby, 
 You did something to me, 
 That no one else has ever done. (Ooh) 
 Something in you eyes, 
 Caught me by surprise, 
 And told me that you are the one. (ooh) 
 But what's that, it's another man, a guy, He'll never understand, 
 The chemistery between me and you (Oow Baby) 
 Something inside of me, 
 Is saying you and I are meant to be, 
 If you can think it you can have it, that's why I believe 
 One day you'll be mine (Mine) 
 No more creepin', sleepin' around, no Whispering, when He's Around 
 One day You'll be mine (mine) 
 No more creepin', sleepin' around, no wishpering, when he's around 
 Noe every time I see you baby, 
 Its plain to see, 
 That I'm everything you've been missing at home ey (Hooooow) 
 So much love to share, 
 Its Something in the air, 
 Telling me I should never leave you alone, 
 But even though I know you got a man, 
 He'll never understand, The chemistery between me and you.(oh baby) 
 You can try to stop it, but it won't quit, 
 You say you don't when I know that you want it. 
 I Know, One Day You'll Be Mine. 
 One day you'll be mine (Mine) 
 No more creepin', sleepin' around, no Whispering, when He's Around 
 One day You'll be mine (mine) 
 No more creepin', sleepin' around, no wishpering, when he's around 
 One day you'll be mine (Mine) 
 No more creepin', sleepin' around, no Whispering, when He's Around 
 One day You'll be mine (mine) 
 No more creepin', sleepin' around, no wishpering, when he's around
