I'm hopin' that this ain't too hard to believe 
 Cause baby you're the only one for me 
 I know it get hard when I'm moving in and out of state 
 But I promise my heart for you I would save 
 Just remember that... 
 No matter how far I go 
 And no matter how long it takes 
 No one or nothing can change 
 Forever yours here I stand (Here I stand baby) 
 You're like a mirror to my soul, but a queen (My queen) 
 And finally now I know just what that means (Oh Yeah) 
 You're the blessing I never thought I would get 
 And to the Lord I humbly bow my head 
 Just remember that... 
 No matter how far I go 
 And no matter how long it takes 
 No one or nothing can change 
 Forever yours here I stand (Here I stand baby) 
 Every since you came (since you came along) 
 It seems like (couldn't get it right) 
 I fell and sunk so low, that there was 
 No way I could be found (never thought 
 Love would find me) 
 And when we make love (Everytime you give, 
 Whoo, give to me your love) 
 Give... you make me feel a way I never felt with no 
 One else, and I can't help myself 
 I'm tellin' you that... 
 No matter how far I go (Yeah) 
 See no matter how long it takes (Yeah) 
 No one or nothing, nothin' babe ever 
 Change, the way I feel, 'cause I'm yo 
 Man, Listen... see 
 Forever yours, yours, all yours here I stand (Yeah) 
 No matter how far I go 
 And no matter how long it takes 
 No one or nothing can change 
 Forever yours... I'll remain... here I stand
