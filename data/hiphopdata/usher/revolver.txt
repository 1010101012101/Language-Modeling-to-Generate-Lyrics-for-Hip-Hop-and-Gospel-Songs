(ITunes Deluxe Edition Track) 
 Cut me 
 Cut me with your tongue 
 Then love me when it's over 
 You don't even know just 
 How you much you taunt me 
 Taunting and provoking 
 Keep words unspoken 
 Pandora's box is open 
 Blame brings pain 
 Accusations seal 
 These walls 
 Walls built up 
 To shield from pain 
 Pain of finding fault 
 Revolving back to pain 
 And we need to stop 
 Just like a revolver, babe 
 Just like a revolver 
 (It goes around) 
 Just like a revolver, babe 
 But I'd rather resolve it, babe 
 Just like a revolver, babe 
 Just like a revolver 
 (It goes around) 
 Just like a revolver, babe 
 But we gotta resolve it babe 
 Piercing 
 Piercing with my actions 
 Spitefully ignore you 
 I don't even care 
 Just how much you take 
 Biten and it's potent 
 You hate it and I know it 
 Pandora's box is open 
 These walls get high baby [x3] 
 It won't ever come down 
 These walls get high baby [x3] 
 It won't ever come down 
 Round and round 
 Like the game roulette 
 Step on up kid 
 And place your bet 
 Round and round 
 Is the route we choose 
 Play that game, man 
 We all gonna lose
