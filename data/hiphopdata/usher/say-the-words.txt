I had a dream when I was just a little boy 
 To find a girl like you 
 We would meet at the park at school 
 And talk till the day was through 
 ...Take a pair of tones 
 And I would comb your hair 
 And you would dream of all the cities 
 And places we could go 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Say the words that you know I won't hear 
 Put your heart out close to my ear 
 We would live to know the time 
 We could stay till the days turns in night. 
 I can still remember dreams as a little boy 
 Now I'm man, and still can't... 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Real love it will never come, if you in it now 
 But I had to learn that lesson down in the... 
 ...Spend the night in the town just to have a little fun 
 In my mind I'm wishing she's the one 
 (I said to myself) 
 Is this to close to reality 
 For you to be that girl from that fantasy 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Say the words that you know I won't hear 
 Put your heart out close to my ear 
 We would live to know the time 
 We could stay till the days turns to night. 
 She stole my head and let's go play the dream again 
 Uh, uh, to find a girl like you 
 (Only you and me around!) 
 I look into your eyes 
 I'm not seeing... 
 I look into your eyes 
 I'm not seeing... 
 Love is pure! 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Say the words that you know I won't hear 
 Put your heart out close to my ear 
 We would live to know the time 
 We could stay till the days turns in night. 
 This is dedicated from the ... 
 I would never, never, never know!
