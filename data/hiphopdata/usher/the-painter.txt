 The temp goes up when she walks by 
 No I ain't no smoker but it gets me high 
 Everything I needed that missing in my life (whouuu) 
 Girl that feels so good, it makes me weak 
 Can't leave you alone 'cause I can't sleep 
 But got to make your toes off 
 Ouu baby so soft I will be your painter 
 Let me get a brush, a thick coat of paint 
 You can be the canvas turn the other way 
 If you can give it you got's to take it 
 Everybody wants to be the painter 
 Everybody's always down to be the painter 
 But no one wants to be in the picture (no one) 
 I got to be the painter left stroke, rightstoke, paintin' the picture 
 Everybody's always tryin' to be the painter 
 Then picture this with me 
 Imagine you and me (the painter)

 I can smell somethin' sweet when you came by 
 But she ain't like the last chick I kicked it with 
 Paint that picture for you girl what's the business? 
 Fresh paint on the two-seater classic 
 Through so fast ay you won't see me passing 
 One stoke we gotta take these clothes off 
 Two stroke I'm about to make you dose off 
 Let me get a brush, a thick coat of paint 
 You can be the canvas turn the other way 
 Now if you can give it you gots to take it 
 Everybody wants to be the painter 
 Everybody's always down to be the painter 
 But no one's wants to be in the picture (no one)
