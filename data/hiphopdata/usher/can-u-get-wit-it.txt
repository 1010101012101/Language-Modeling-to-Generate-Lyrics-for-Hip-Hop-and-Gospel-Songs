Every time I look at U 
 There's so many things that I wanna do 
 I promise you when I'm ready 
 I'm gonna spend my whole life with U 
 What is love is it steady 
 'Cause I don't know what to do 
 So tell me girl if your ready 
 To do what we came to do 
 One day we could be together 
 Cause you know that I wanna be down, baby 
 But right now we can all forget it 
 U know I gots to get around 
 I don't have much money, I can't buy a diamond ring 
 I'm not tryin' to be funny, but it's only a sexual thing 
 Can you get wit it 
 It's like that 
 It's only a sexual thing 
 Can you get wit it 
 It's like that 
 Your gonna love the joy I bring 
 Can you get wit it 
 It's like that 
 It's only a sexual thing 
 Can you get wit it 
 It's like that 
 Your gonna love the joy I bring 
 Please forgive me 'cause I don't ever wanna rush U 
 I might sound a little hasty 
 But let's do what we came to do 
 Now, U know that time is really precious 
 And you wasted a lot of mine 
 I'm gonna have 2 keep on movin' 
 If you can't make up your mind, yeah 
 One day we could be together 
 Cause you know that I wannna be down 
 But righ now we can all forget it 
 Cause you know I gots to get around 
 I don't have much money, I can't buy a diamond ring 
 I'm not tryin' to be funny, but it's only a sexual thing 
 Can you get wit it 
 It's like that 
 It's only a sexual thing 
 Can you get wit it 
 It's like that 
 Your gonna love the joy I bring
