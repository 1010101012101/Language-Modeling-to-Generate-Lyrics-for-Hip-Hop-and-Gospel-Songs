Now baby listen to me when I Tell you that I ain't a Perfect man 
 Can't keep listening 
 To the whispering that's Coming from your friends 
 I recognize that my past is Bad but let's get past the past when everybody's hatin' Can get desecratin 
 But no hesitation no no 
 Tell them just get gone 
 They can neva keep a man 
 So they wouldn't understand 
 That's why they alone 
 Baby let it go 
 I'm just lettin you know 
 They neva see for themselves 
 But they always wanna help 
 That's why they just echo 
 Listen to them haters 
 And liars and 
 What your friends say 
 Everything that they speakin' They just repeatin 
 And they echo echo echo 
 They hear them rumors 
 And they echo echo 
 But they don't know what They been talkin' bout 
 Say iv been cheatin' 
 Somebody saw me creepin' 
 On the weekend

 Baby a long time ago 
 And they echo echo echo
