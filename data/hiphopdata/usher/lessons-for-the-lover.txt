Turn the light on! 
 How could someone hurt you 
 But still make you feel so good? 
 How the screaming... 
 You stand there and let them good 
 Just 'cause he gives you pain, 
 That don't mean he ain't the one! 
 Fuck you at your brain, you'll be smiling when he's done 
 So my advice would be 
 No, don't leave, don't go so easy! 
 Let the argue... turn you on! 
 It's worthy! 
 And these are the lessons learned by love 
 These are the reasons we make love 
 There's no exception, one day 
 We gotta look each other in the eye 
 You learn all these lessons when you're in love 
 Lesson for the lover, for lover! 
 Lesson for the love, oh lover! 
 So hard to imagine living life without them there 
 'Cause now you're so cut out in the passion 
 But this shit is beyond compare, yeah! 
 'Cause... make your heart beat, beat, beat like a drug 
 You fought hard, but think about how hard you come 
 So my advice would be 
 No, don't leave, don't go so easy! 
 Let the argue... turn you on! 
 It's worthy! 
 And these are the lessons learned by love 
 These are the reasons we make love 
 There's no exception, one day 
 We gotta look each other in the eye 
 You learn all these lessons when you're in love 
 Lesson for the lover, for lover! 
 (Turn the lights on!) 
 Lesson for the love, oh lover! 
 No one wants to be fighting all day, love, all night, love 
 So we just scream to wish... making up 
 Yeah, and as time goes on we're feeling ok, babe, all right, love 
 And we'll forget about it in the morning, oh, oh! 
 And these are the lessons learned by love 
 These are the reasons we make love 
 There's no exception, one day 
 We gotta look each other in the eye 
 You learn all these lessons when you're in love 
 Lesson for the lover, for lover! 
 (Turn the lights on!) 
 Lesson for the love, oh lover!
