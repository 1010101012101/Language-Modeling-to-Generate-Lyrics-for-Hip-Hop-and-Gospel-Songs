She has the world tonight 
 She lost 
 The boy she slept with 
 She has no one to love anymore 
 But I'll tell ya 
 My door is open 
 Cause her hair is hott 
 I like the way she walks 
 And talks when she says she loves me 
 Oh baby she's hot 
 I want her lips on mine 
 'Cause I'l I cn to s want her body 
 Oh
