 Yo 
 Yo usher 
 I'm trying find her man 
 I have no idea who she is 
 Can you help 
 Cool 
 (Usher) 
 Wifey where are you 
 Wifey where are you 
 Wifey where are you 
 Cause here I am 
 (Usher) 
 Mother told me 
 Don't look for love 
 You will not find it 
 Be patient babe 
 For now my eyes I'm closing 
 I guess I have to wait 
 Late at night thinking of her 
 And I know it don't sound right 
 I don't know what she looks like 
 But she's my baby 
 Will holla back 
 Tell the thruth 
 (Usher) 
 Wifey where are you 
 Wifey where are you 
 Wifey where are you 
 Cause here I am 
 (Pharrell) 
 So maybe you think I'm going out of my mind now 
 Or maybe my mind is going out of me 
 For now my eyes are closed but wait 
 How am I to see 
 (Usher) 
 Late at night thinking of her 
 And I know it don't sound right 
 I don't know what she looks like 
 But she's my baby 
 Will holla back 
 Tell the thruth 
 Just to show her the skylights 
 I promise to be her sunlight 
 Until my dying day 
 (Usher) 
 Wifey where are you 
 Wifey where are you 
 Wifey where are you 
 Cause here I am 
 (Usher) 
 Late at night thinking of her 
 And I know it don't sound right 
 I don't know what she looks like 
 But she's my baby 
 Will holla back 
 Tell the truth 
 Just to show her the skylights 
 I promise to be her sunlight 
 Until my dying day 
 (Pharrell) 
 I send my prayers about you to heaven 
 Did you get them 
 (Usher) 
 U probably don't want to move 
 I'm begging 
 Believe me baby 
 (Usher) 
 Wifey where are you 
 Wifey where are you 
 Wifey where are you 
 Cause here I am 
 (Usher) 
 Wifey where are you 
 Wifey where are you 
 Wifey where are you 
 Cause here I am
