Future needs a big kiss 
 Winds blow with a twist 
 Never seen a move like this 
 Can you see it too 
 Night is falling everywhere 
 Rockets hit the funfair 
 Satan loves a bomb scare 
 But it won't scare you 
 Yeah sexy boots 
 Get on your boots yeah 
 Free me from the dark dream 
 Candy bars, ice cream 
 All the kids are screaming but the ghosts aren't real 
 Here's what you gotta be 
 Love and community 
 Laughter is eternity if the joy is real 
 You don't know how beautiful (2x) 
 You are 
 You don't know 
 You get it do you 
 You don't know 
 How beautiful you are 
 If someone's into blowing up 
 We're into growing up 
 Women are the future 
 All the big revelations 
 I've gotta submarine, you've got gasoline 
 I don't wanna talk about wars between nations 
 Not right now 
 Sexy boots yeah (no no no) 
 Get on your boots yeah (Not right now) 
 Foxy boots 
 You don't know how beautiful (2x) 
 You are 
 You don't know 
 You get it do you 
 You don't know 
 How beautiful you are 
 Sexy boots 
 I don't wanna talk about wars between nations 
 Let me in the sound (3x) 
 Sound 
 Let me in the sound sound 
 Let me in the sound 
 My God I'm going down 
 I don't wanna drown now 
 Let me in the sound 
 Let me in the sound (3x) 
 Sound 
 Let me in the sound sound 
 Let me in the sound 
 Get on your boots 
 Get on your boots 
 Get on your boots 
 Yeah yeah 
 Get on your boots 
 Get on your boots 
 Get on your boots
