Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
 When you feel it in your body you found somebody 
 Who makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew 
 Said you act like you're ready but you don't really know 
 And everything in your past, wanna let it go 
 I've been there, done it, fucked around 
 After all that, this is what I found 
 Nobody wants to be alone 
 If you're touched by the words in this song, then baby 
 U got, u got it bad when you're on the phone 
 Hang up and you call right back 
 U got, u got it bad, if you miss a day without your friend 
 Your whole life's off track 
 You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house 
 You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about 
 U got it bad when you're out with someone 
 But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else, u got it bad 
 When you say that you love 'em and you really know 
 Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more 
 Like my money, all my cars, you can have it all back 
 Flowers, cards and candy, I do it just 'cause I'm 
 Said I'm fortunate to have you girl 
 I want you to know, I really adore you 
 All my people who know what's going on 
 Look at your mate, help me sing my song 
 Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl 
 I'm gon' tell it to the whole wide world 
 Lady say I'm your girl, you're my man 
 Promise to love you the best I can 
 See I've been there, done it, fucked around 
 After all that, this is what I found 
 Everyone of y'all are just like me 
 It's too bad that you can't see that you got it bad 
 U got, u got it bad when you're on the phone 
 Hang up and you call right back 
 U got, u got it bad, if you miss a day without your friend 
 Your whole life's off track 
 Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house 
 You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about 
 U got it bad when you're out with someone 
 But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else, u got it bad 
 U got, u got it bad when you're on the phone 
 Hang up and you call right back 
 U got, u got it bad, if you miss a day without your friend 
 Your whole life's off track 
 You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house 
 You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about 
 U got it bad when you're out with someone 
 But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else, u got it bad
