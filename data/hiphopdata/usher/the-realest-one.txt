I had four girlfriends, three years of lies 
 Even with all that I kept that two on the side 
 Wanna search to find the one to be my everything 
 Believe me, it ain't easy 
 But I'm determined that she's out there (where) 
 Somewhere I just gotta get up and meet her 
 Overlooking the fact that I might be right here with her 
 She the one to check me, never disrespect me 
 When shit gets hectic she'll protect me 
 Model fuck with her and say she bad 
 Not knowing she the realest that I ever had 
 She's the realest girl I've ever been with (oh oh oh) 
 The one you wanna show your life to (show your life to) 
 The only one that understands and make you a better man 
 Yeah I got a real one, hey I got a real one 
 She's the realest girl I've ever been with 
 Now that I got her I ain't tryna go back 
 I done had a lot of women in my life and for the first time 
 She's the realest girl I've ever been with (whoa oh oh oh oh) 
 Now usually the girl I'm talking bout is the worst treated 
 But first needed to help me get through my problems 
 She's heard it all, seen them come and go 
 Even though I hurt her time and time again 
 She's still right there to help me solve them 
 Telling me I deserve so much better then what I'm dealing with 
 Showing me they ain't there for me and she ain't feeling it 
 Telling me that it's your life do what you gotta do 
 But I bet you'll come right back 
 And what's crazy I did exactly what she said and came right back 
 What about your family they tryna stop me 
 They told me think about your image 
 Ay I wish they could see that 
 She's the realest girl I've ever been with (oh oh oh) 
 The one you wanna show your life to (everything) 
 The only one that understands and make you a better man 
 Yeah I got a real one, hey I got a real one 
 She's the realest girl I've ever been with 
 Now that I got her I ain't tryna go back 
 I done had a lot of women in my life and for the first time 
 Listen, there's only so many ways to know that 
 You're heading in the right direction 
 You gotta find your way 
 Make sure you feel it in your heart 
 And even then you may not know for sure (for sure) 
 If she'll be the one to keep you happy 
 You got too many moves, too much to learn 
 You got so much to lose 
 When you know you got a real one 
 She's the realest girl I've ever been with 
 The one you wanna show your life to (show your life to) 
 The only one that understands and make you a better man 
 Yeah I got a real one, hey I got a real one 
 She's the realest girl I've ever been with 
 Now that I got her I ain't tryna go back 
 See I done had a lot of women in my life and for the first time 
 She's the realest girl I've ever been with 
 She's the realest girl I've ever been with 
 The one you wanna show your life to (show your life to) 
 The only one that understands and make you a better man 
 Yeah I got a real one, hey I got a real one 
 She's the realest girl I've ever been with 
 Now that I got her I ain't tryna go back 
 See I done had a lot of women in my life and for the first time 
 She's the realest girl I've ever been with
