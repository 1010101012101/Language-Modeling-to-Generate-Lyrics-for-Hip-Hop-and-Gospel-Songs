You gunna say something to the people 
 Prayer for you, a prayer to you 
 Do I sound that bad? 
 Just the simple thought of you means everything 
 To my life you give meaning, you're the best thing 
 So precious my gift for life 
 That's why I send you up this prayer 
 I pray for your protection, your covering 
 That everything intended for you, you'll receive 
 And I believe He'll guide you 
 Lord, honor my prayer 
 Prayer for you, a prayer to you 
 I pray for you, pray for you 
 I'll do my best to be there for you everyday 
 To be what my father wished he was to me 
 Baby, I got you 
 Daddy, you'll be there 
 I'll be there 
 To encourage you to be the best you can be 
 You carry my name, I pray that you're better than me 
 I ain't going nowhere 
 Even when I get on your nerves 
 'Cause I'm your daddy 
 My prayer for you 
 Son I pray for you
