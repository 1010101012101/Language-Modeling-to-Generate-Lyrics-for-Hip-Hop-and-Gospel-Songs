Yo, yo, yo 
 See, it's rare that you find people like us 
 'Cause all y'all other look out there doin' what I'm doin' 
 Or tryin' to do what I'm doin' but you can't 
 'Cause I do it my way 
 What about you 
 Huh, huh come on 
 I do any and everything you want to 
 Make your girl say, ooh, ooh, why's he so fly 
 She beeps me whenever she wanna get freaky 
 You can get mad if you want too 
 Say whatever you want be she still gon' give it up 
 'Cause she likes it my way, my way, my way 
 You can't satisfy her needs 
 She keeps runnin' back to see me do it 
 My way, my way 
 What I say goes and I'm in control 
 Bad ass senoritas, two seaters with kicks 
 New kick's all in the mix 
 Don't turn no tricks, they turn for me 
 Catchin' bricks don't concern me 
 So forget lil' midget, my mind on seven digits 
 Before I pay heaven's skies a visit, now dig it 
 I'm pullin' all stops 
 Sayin' you can't front on me 
 So from this day forth you know I'm all about the heat 
 And what I do is the major league 
 That's why your girlfriend's paging me 
 And she know like he know, you don't see her like I see her 
 So she's out the do' 
 Shot gun in my drop havin' fun with the Don, system bassoon 
 Conversation and she been chasin' me 
 Facin' me sayin' "Give it to me know, baby" 
 My way, my way 
 You can't satisfy her needs 
 She keeps runnin' back to see me do it 
 My way, my way 
 What I say goes and I'm in control 
 Don't check me 
 It was your girl who let me 
 Take it this far then, ooh wee 
 She had to have it every chance that she could get 
 But you think you a baller and I ain't gon' call her 
 Clip that, you can get mad if you want to 
 Say whatever you want but she still gon' give it up 
 She likes it my way, my way 
 You can't satisfy her needs 
 She keeps runnin' back to see me do it 
 My way, my way 
 What I say goes and I'm in control 
 My way, my way 
 You can't satisfy her needs 
 She keeps runnin' back to see me do it 
 My way, my way 
 What I say goes and I'm in control 
 My way, my way 
 You can't satisfy her needs 
 She keeps runnin' back to see me do it 
 My way, my way 
 What I say goes and I'm in control
