I just wanna take my time, my time with you 
 Were here now while the thunder is roaring 
 And the windows are blowing cause its pouring tonight 
 I put my hand on your chest 
 And its beating kinda fast so its mine 
 And this moment of silence you look me in the eyes 
 Nothings verbalized 
 I need you so much 
 The more I'm away from you 
 The more of you I want 
 (I need you) 
 Tell me that you wanna make love 
 Tell me that you wanna relieve love 
 Tell me that you wanna make love yeah 
 Baby I'm a man that believes in what it is 
 Were going to a whole 'nother level 
 When we do it it's so much more than sex tonight 
 When we're connected, every touch every kiss 
 We finally found what we been looking for in this bed 
 Its deeper than love 
 The more of you I have the more of you I want 
 I need you babe 
 (Tell me that you wanna make love) 
 Tell me that you wanna make love 
 Tell me that you wanna relieve love 
 Tell me that you wanna make love yeah 
 Baby I'm a man that believes in what it is 
 Hey hey 
 Oh baby can we go deeper deeper than the surface 
 Farther 
 I want to hold you 
 When you so wet and I'm so hard 
 And the two become one we work out our problems 
 We fix it, when we get body to body, body to body 
 Body to body 
 When you so wet and I'm so hard 
 And when the two become one it's like oh my god 
 And then we feel like our spirits want to leave our body 
 Leave our body, leave our body 
 When you so wet and I'm so hard 
 And the two become one we work out our problems 
 We fix it, when we get body to body, body to body 
 Body to body 
 When you so wet and I'm so hard 
 And when the two become one it's like oh my god 
 And then we feel like our spirits want to leave our body 
 Leave our body, leave our body 
 You're soul, lets? 
 Say you'll never leave me, say you'll never go 
 I love you so much
