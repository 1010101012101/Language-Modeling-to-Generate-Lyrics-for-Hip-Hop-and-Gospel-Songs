This is what you do 
 This is what you do 
 This is what you do 
 This is what you do 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the 
 Things it come along with 
 You make me 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the 
 Things it come along with 
 You make me, you make me 
 Before anything began between us 
 You were like my best friend 
 The one I used to run and talk to 
 When me and my girl was having problems 
 You used to say it'll be OK 
 Suggest little nice things I should do 
 And when I go home at night 
 And lay my head down 
 All I seem to think about was you 
 And how 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the 
 Things it come along with 
 You make me 
 Now what's bad is you're the 
 One that hooked us up 
 Knowing it should have been you 
 What's sad is that I love her 
 But I'm falling for you 
 What should I do? 
 Should I tell my baby bye-bye? 
 Should I do exactly what I feel inside? 
 'Cause I, I don't wanna go, 
 Don't need to stay 
 But I really need to get it together 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the 
 Things it come along with 
 You make me 
 Baby it's kind of honey 
 How you make me feel 
 I've been with your friend 
 For about five years (five years) 
 I never thought that I would 
 Change my decision (uh-huh) 
 I wanna kiss you and hold your 
 Hand with your permission 
 Uh-huh 
 Honey got me twisted in the 
 Head like a cuckoo clock 
 Trying not to look 
 But I, but I, but I can't stop 
 What can I say? I wanna be with you 
 Usher bring in the hook, 
 I'm out dude what? 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the 
 Things it come along with 
 You make me 
 Ooh you're making me 
 You're making me, you're make me 
 Oh you make meÂ¡- 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the 
 Things it come along with 
 You make me 
 Leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the 
 Things it come along with 
 You make me, you make me 
 You make me wanna leave the one I'm with 
 Start a new relationship with you 
 This is what you do 
 Think about her and all the 
 Things it come along with 
 You make me
