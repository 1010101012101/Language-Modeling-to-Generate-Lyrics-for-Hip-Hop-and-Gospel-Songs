Raymond vs Raymond 
 There's 3 sides to every story 
 There's 1 side, there's the other 
 And then there's the truth 
 Usher 
 Captivating, perfection, innovator 
 Seductive, superstar, (music) unparrallel 
 Sex, world renown, dance, tempo, epic 
 Spotlight, passionate, uncomparable 
 U r what we say you are 
 Monstar! 
 Feel my heart beat 
 Yeah close your eyes 
 This what you want 
 I'm gon take you where I can give it to u 
 Ay Look what you made me do babe 
 Said you know me 
 Said you want all of me 
 Then you got that other side 
 You got some nerve babe 
 You think ur so bad 
 Ur so serious, I'm just having fun 
 Don't u, don't you tell me 
 Tell me that things get to you 
 Without all that attitude 
 Feel like you might be the one tonight babe 
 You got me so excited baby 
 Girl if you're lonely and you're longing for a lover 
 You know I'll be, I'll be here all night 
 I'm right above you, you don't have to look no further 
 You know I'll be, I'll be here all night 
 I'm back celebrating time 
 (Tell me how deep you want me to go) 
 I'm back celebrate life 
 (I'm gonna be your best) 
 Nightmare, wish, dream all in one night 
 I'll be the pleasure pain lover you like 
 What you made me do, look at what you made me do 
 Look at what you made me do, look at what you brought me to 
 Redefine in Beverly every time we lay, every time we go 
 (We go deeper) 
 Said she wanna bring out the beast but she can't take it 
 Imma let you hold something darling b-b-b bang I'm gon shoot it like a gun 
 Girl if you're lonely and you're longing for a lover 
 You know I'll be, I'll be here all night 
 I'm right above you, you don't have to look no further 
 You know I'll be, I'll be here all night 
 I'm back celebrating time 
 (Tell me how deep you want me to go)

 (I'm gonna be your best) 
 Nightmare, wish, dream all in one night 
 I'll be the pleasure pain lover you like 
 What you made me do, look at what you made me do 4x 
 Chorus till fade 
 Girl if you're lonely and you're longing for a lover 
 You know I'll be, I'll be here all night

 You know I'll be, I'll be here all night
