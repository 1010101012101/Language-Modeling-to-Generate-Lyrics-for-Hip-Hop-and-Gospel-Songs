Like a comet 
 Blazing across the evening sky 
 Gone Too Soon 
 Like a rainbow 
 Fading in a twinkling eye 
 Gone Too Soon 
 Shiny and sparkly and sendingly by in one day 
 Gone one night 
 Like the losses in night 
 On a cloudy afternoon 
 Gone Too Soon 
 Like a castle 
 Built upon a sandy beach 
 Gone Too Soon 
 Like a bird flock 
 That is just beyond your reach 
 Gone Too Soon 
 Born to amuse 
 To aspire, DELIGHT in one day 
 Gone one night 
 Ooh 
 Like a sunset day from the raising woo 
 Gone Too Soon 
 Gone Too Soon
