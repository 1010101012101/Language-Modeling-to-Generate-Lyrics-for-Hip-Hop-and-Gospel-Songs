I can't believe my eyes, Looking at your sexy ass body 
 The way you do it with your hands up, I just wanna be all over 
 Let me rock with you, Don't let nothing interrupt this groove 
 Going at it like we bout to, Touching all on you like you're my girl 
 You probably say that's a damn shame, I don't even know your name 
 I know it probably won't matter tonight cause you been all on me I'm like okay 
 I suggest we take this here home so we can make a love song 
 I can be the best part of you waking up, Shawty, holla at me if that sound okay 
 I see you wanna take it slow, Gone and drop it to the floor real low 
 You know I want you back 'cause I been all on that ass and you ain't looking at me sideways 
 The DJ is playing the last song and its coming down to our last call, baby 
 This slow jam is specially dedicated, what better way for this night to end? Come on 
 You probably say that's a damn shame, I don't even know your name 
 I know it probably won't matter tonight cause you been all on me I'm like okay 
 I suggest we take this here home so we can make a love song 
 I can be the best part of you waking up, Shawty, holla at me if that sound okay 
 Car's waiting outside, baby, if you ready to roll 
 Now that I got you opened up curious to find, to know what's on your mind girl 
 Girl we been at it so long I can't wait just want to make sure we're on the same page 
 I be on some other shit when the liquor talk and I know you... 
 You probably say that's a damn shame, I don't even know your name 
 I know it probably won't matter tonight cause you been all on me I'm like okay 
 I suggest we take this here home so we can make a love song 
 I can be the best part of you waking up, Shawty, holla at me if that sound okay
