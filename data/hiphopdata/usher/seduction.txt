Ah, sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy, ooh 
 Voluptuous, I love your confidence 
 You got it, you got it 
 Seduce me baby, seduce me 
 Just to get my attention 
 Sent a note and a drink 
 When we made our connection 
 She just nodded and winked 
 On this note it said 
 Its bout time we get together 
 Lets dance now, hook up later 
 We can do whatever 
 She had confidence 
 But it's all part of the game 
 'Cause to her, though I'm whipped, 
 Don't really mean a thing 
 She knew just what I liked 
 And now I'm thirsty for more 
 Seduction 
 Sensuous, sexy, erotic, 
 How you working your body 
 Ooh oh, you gon' make me do it, 
 Do it to ya 
 Seduction 
 You throwed out your best 
 To get me outta control, baby 
 The more I play around wit you 
 Baby wanna get down wit you 
 Down wit you, down with ya 
 You got my attention, 
 What you gon' do with it? 
 Baby turn around, stick it out, 
 I wanna see it 
 She make the first move, smooth, intoxicatin' 
 She plays me 
 I'm fightin' not to lose control 
 Now I'm feelin' a little tension 
 Don't know whos watchin 
 Getting big 
 In too deep, and I can't stop it 
 Your makin' it hard for me 
 Stay (hard) to walk away (hard) 
 Don't wanna play no more (hard) 
 I can't take it baby 
 Seduction (oh you got me baby) 
 Sensuous, sexy, erotic, 
 How you working your body 
 Ooh oh, you gon' make me do it, 
 Do it to ya 
 Seduction 
 You throwed out your best 
 To get me outta control, baby 
 The more I play around wit you 
 Baby wanna get down wit you 
 Down wit you, down wit ya 
 Baby whatever you want, girl you got it 
 I'll let ya satisfy 
 'Cause it's so hard to resist, oh your body 
 Got me on fire 
 Got vivid thoughts in my mind 
 Of positions that I'm gonna try 
 But is it worth all the hurt 
 Should I risk it just for one night 
 Once I give in, she's gonna win, 
 Either way I lose 
 But I gotta have you 
 I'm tryin' to chill, but she got me on the spot 
 She's so cocky, and the way she watchin me 
 Got me feelin' hot, uh 
 Shorty know that I got a girl 
 And I really can't break the rules, plus 
 Paparazzi snappin shots, 
 And its hard for me to shake these fools 
 So do I, one, put it on her, work my way to the front 
 Do I, two, play my part, and she will know not to pull no stunts, 
 Or maybe, three, chase the cat, 'cause she's sendin' me on the hunt 
 Nah, fuck that, I ain't no punk, imma give shorty what she wants 
 Seduction (oh you got me baby) 
 Sensuous, sexy, erotic, (gotta have you) 
 How you working your body 
 (We should leave right now, my cars outside) 
 Ooh oh, you gon' make me do it, 
 Do it to ya 
 Seduction 
 You throwed out your best 
 (I got the VIP suite baby) 
 To get me outta control, baby 
 The more I play around wit you 
 Baby wanna get down wit you 
 Down wit you, down wit ya 
 (Chorus fade to end)
