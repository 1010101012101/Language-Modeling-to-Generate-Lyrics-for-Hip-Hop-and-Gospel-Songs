Every thing that I've been doin' is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side wit a crib and a ride 
 I've telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess 'cause it's been goin' on so long 
 Girl I been doin' you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 Every thing that I've been doin' is all bad 
 I got a chick on the side wit a crib and a ride 
 I've telling you so many lies ain't nothing good it's all bad 
 And I just wanna confess 'cause it's been goin' on so long 
 Girl I been doin' you so wrong and I want you to know that 
 Everytime I was in L. A. I was with my ex-girlfriend 
 Everytime you called I told you 
 "Baby I'm workin." (No!) 
 I was out doin' my dirt (Oh!) 
 Wasn't thinkin' 'bout you gettin' hurt 
 (I) Was hand in hand in the Beverly Center like man 
 Not givin' a damn who sees me 
 So gone (I know) 
 So wrong (Just listen) 
 Thinkin' I got it and left you sittin' at home 
 Thinkin' about me 
 Bein' a good girl that you are 
 But you prolly believe you got a good man 
 I man that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done 
 Brace yourself 
 It ain't good 
 But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else 
 If I could turn back the hands of time and start all over I would 
 Stead of everything bein all bad beby everything will be all good 
 I don't wanna lose you but I know what I'm telling you ain't gon' make you wanna stay, probally just make you run away or 
 Mad enough to punch me in my face 
 I've been livin' like an idiot and I deserve every bit of it 
 I know, today is the day that I ain't gonna play in a board 
 Girl, I'm sorry baby I'm sorry 
 But I can no longer walk around with this stress on my chest 
 I confess... 
 Can you break it down... 
 (Harmonica playing) 
 (Chorus fades out)
