What's up baby? 
 I'm so glad I got you here 
 I'm so in love with you 
 And I don't ever wanna lose you 
 I wanna take this to the next level 
 I hope you ready 
 Now that you're here 
 I got somethin' to say baby 
 I think that you should know 
 You're doin' the most, suga 
 So don't worry 'bout the situation 
 I'd never let you go 
 Can you handle it 
 If I go there baby with you? 
 I can handle it 
 I can go there baby with you 
 Oh, I hear you talkin' babe 
 Can you handle it? 
 Can I go there baby with you? 
 We gon' set it off, we gon' tear it up 
 Baby can you handle? 
 Ooh baby, you say all the time 
 You only want the best of my love 
 Now I can see that 
 There's only one way to tear it up, yeah 
 I'm willin' to tell you 
 Everything I let stand between us 
 But what if I tell you too much? 
 What about you babe? 
 Will you tell me all the freaky things you are? 
 Before I do, need you to know 
 If we make it through our love will grow 
 Oh ho ho, imagine how amazing things would be 
 Can you handle it? 
 Can I go there baby with you? 
 We gon' set it off, we gon' tear it up 
 Baby can you handle?

 Baby, can you handle? 
 Ooh hey yeah, baby 
 I feel sometimes in my mind 
 That you won't wanna stay with my love 
 Oh baby 
 If I can be sure 
 Inside out that you know exactly 
 The man that comes to see you 
 I'll go deep as I can 
 Givin' you the rest of my love 
 But what if I tell you too much? 
 Uh, so much to explore 
 So much we have yet to discover 
 I ask myself, should I go there? Should I do it? Yeah! Ooh! 
 Can I give it to you fully? Can you handle it? 
 Can you handle it 
 If I go there baby with you? 
 Can I go there? 
 We gon' lay it out, we gon' tear it up 
 Baby, can you handle? 
 I can handle it

 We gon' set it out, we gon' work it out 
 Baby can you handle?
