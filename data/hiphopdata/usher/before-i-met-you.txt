Whoa whoa whoa yeah yeah 
 Saw you for you yeah 
 Remember [x15] you changed my life in so many way I just look back to how I used to be and how you dealt with me just want to thank you for... 
 Just in case I never see your face again (face again) 
 Just in case the worst was meant to happen (happen) 
 Just in case tomorrow never come there is something you should know (should know) 
 I've given you every bit of the man I am (of the man I am) 
 I know at times it wasn't pretty but it was all I had 
 I never held back not one lil bit and the world can attest to this 
 And baby you flipped my upside down (listen to me now) 
 I was a hustler and player girl before I met you 
 I hit a lil something I did a little something 
 But how you made a difference who looked 
 You got my life together and I thank you forever 
 I really used to throw a lot 
 But I do one every night and sometimes I had two 
 But all that has changed my game my frame of mind you got it right 
 And I love you life yo I love you for life 
 There was so many times I wasn't there for you 
 And for everyone of those times I hated myself for 
 The way I went about it the ups and the downs one foot in while the other foots out 
 Loving on you loving on another and I ain't no different from any of the brothers 
 What I did to you right here right now in this here place 
 In this here space as my heart pour out as I state my place as I break it down 
 To tell you where I'm coming from so you've seen the good you've done 
 So you've feel the change you've made stay with me everyday 
 I was a hustler and player girl before I met you 
 (?) 
 But how you made a difference who looked 
 You got my life together and I thank you forever 
 I really used to throw a lot 
 But I do one every night and sometimes I had two 
 But now all that has changed my game my frame of mind you got it right 
 And I love you life yo I love you for life 
 Girl if I died tonight before I wake 
 Know that you touched my life in oh so many ways 
 And should all this I had to give would you remember 
 Remember my heart remember it was good remember I tried as long as I could 
 Remember that I gave till I had nothing else remember my voice 
 I was a hustler and player girl before I met you 
 I hit a lil something I did a little something 
 But how you made a difference who looked 
 You got my life together and I thank you forever 
 I really used to throw a lot before I met you 
 But I do one every night and sometimes I had two 
 But all that has changed my game my frame of mind you got it right 
 And I love you life yo I love you for life 
 Whoa whoa whoa
