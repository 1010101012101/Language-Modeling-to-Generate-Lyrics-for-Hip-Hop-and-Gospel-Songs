Bored bored in my house it's time 4 
 Me to hit the streets and find me 
 A freak without a bra unda her blouse 
 It's over straight through finished hey 
 You 
 Look like that nigga that played in 
 Menace 
 That's me but I'm not celebrity 
 Stricken 
 They be chosen figuring I must be 
 Oozing 
 With the bubbling doe they be sayin' 
 Oh! He look right plus his flow sound 
 Tight I don't know what he be talkin' 
 About but it makes me upset but at 
 The same 
 Time it kinda makes me wet the game in 
 The rhyme tells me that he's a vet 
 It also tells me to get Met girl it pays 
 But she doesn't know I'll molest her 
 Days 
 Like sunrays don't play me ride to my shit 
 Baby. Remove ya hands from ya 
 Draws no 
 Diggin' in designated areas it'll make 
 Me think ya itchin' for a bitchin' 
 Causin' me 
 To holler obscenities they be dissin' 
 Me, these 
 Swingers, dig in they're ass turn 
 Around 
 And then smell they fingers 
 I caught one 
 No bullshit no joke that's why I had to 
 Stop 
 Hitten' Indo smoke 'cause I be flashin' 
 On 
 These ho's the type of shit I see on 
 Summer days make me write but I 
 Never 
 Bite when I be riden' 
 Hoorodden wit my folks Jay-Z is 
 Crazy 
 Straight soldiers in this shit to 
 Leave his side you couldn't pay me 
 We be clownin' 
 But won't get caught slippen' and 
 Sliden' slouchy 
 In the afterlife talkin' like they got me, 
 Damn! 
 I don't wanna die so I ride wit my 
 Patna' one eye 
 One guy always be at me at the light 
 Hollerin' 
 A bra I'll make ya windows tight faulty 
 Is what he be on that squeegee see, 
 I be 
 Seeing streaks and shit get the fuck 
 Away from my car I ain't got no 
 Money 
 But I'm lying he smiled at me then 
 Winked and flash me his diamond I 
 Smobbed out the lot hit the corner 
 And peeped him on a plot I watched a 
 Nigga get got then around the corner 
 We come took off the wig and gave 
 Me 
 The game the same sentiment came 
 From 
 His intent but it's irrelevant 'cause 
 Game recognize game and I'm intelligent 
 So save it up and out burnt rubber on 
 Tha 
 Pavement, the type of shit I see on 
 Summer 
 Days makes me write but I never bite 
 When I be riden'
