I'm cruisin I'm losin' money on gas 
 I pass a car with a star in it 
 I stare for a minute but that's the limit 
 Otherwise gas won't be the only thing 
 I'm losin' money too, ooh wee 
 It's Tuesday two days after the weekend 
 Imagine if the weekend was a day 
 For weak minded men anyway 
 I take my train of thought I bought a fat sack 
 And I'm happy 'cause I got nappy 
 Soldiers in my crew ya through if 
 You don't learn so I learnt, that I'm burnt 
 I ran into my homie, yeah wassup? At least I thought he was 
 But then I caught the buzz that he was talkin' behind my back 
 From his girl, ain't that Earl? 
 For those who can't feel me, Earl means wack 
 In fact, I had that problem a few times 
 But I'll just splurge it in a new rhyme 
 Then forget it maybe I'll split it in half 
 Or laugh like this ha, ha, ha, can you feel me? 
 I faked the funk and conversated without a doubt 
 He was a chump but with clout 
 I ended my route at the liquor store 
 And I tried to buy a Guinness Stout 
 But I remembered it was nasty 
 But fools drink it 'cause it's a hip-hop classy 
 You can miss me with that trendy drink 
 'Cause they all make your breath stink 
 Plus death is linked to all alcohol that Arabians won't let you buy 
 They keep tellin' me my identification is a lie 
 Why would I put my face on plastic and in the space 
 Where it says birthdate put "See owner" 
 Fool, I'm a teenage organ donor 
 So I pick up my I.D. I ain't trippin', why? 
 'Cause I'm high, already, on life, once again, I'm riding 
 I'm about to hit the eastside of Oakland 
 I got my seat belt on so when the heat's felt 
 From 5.0, I'll turn up the song and start 
 Singing, "I wish police was a lease 
 That was up" Can you feel me? 
 Well it's gettin' dark but it's daylight savings time 
 Clocks go back but I stay focused and ahead 
 'Cause I wanna be fat, can you feel me? 
 If you rap, I like to fully flex, I like to box 
 I like breakin' bullies necks 
 I like collecting checks and collecting respect 
 But I'm not there yet and until then I'll just sell dank, sacks 
 20's, 10's, I'm drivin' the weights to be 
 Prepared in case I meet my fate and I'm always thinking 
 "Where will I go when I die? Will I be underground like I am now 
 Or in the sky?" My man, plan B is smilin' 
 'Cause he can feel me, wassup Jess
