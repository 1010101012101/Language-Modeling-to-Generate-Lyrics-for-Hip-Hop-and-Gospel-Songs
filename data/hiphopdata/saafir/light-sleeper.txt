I know I'm an emotionally disturbed 
 Person 
 People think I'm talkin' to myself 
 When I'm 
 Rehearsin' on the rhyme. A mass 
 Productionist, 
 A mass production matador, pan it 
 More to 
 The left, there you go. Minimize the 
 Synthe-sizer wiser when I wind up for 
 The pitch, but I don't pitch a bitch 
 'Cause 
 Sales get derailed and towed an 
 Abundance 
 Of cash. Damn, I let it go. He was my man. 
 I tried to trust him, but I busted him 
 Twice 
 In my trash can and I'm askin'. I don't 
 Need 
 Psychology to see, the dichotomy in 
 Me. 
 Knew something was fishy, but I'm 
 Better than 
 Wishy washy or topsy turvy. It kinda 
 Irked 
 Me that I caught him sleepin' 
 'Cause I try 
 To be wide awake, but ye slows it 
 Down 
 So I can't dilate and show that I'm 
 Bigger 
 Than that. But I also have to consider 
 The fact that opposed to him not 
 Being 
 The right peeper, I'm a light sleeper 
 So what does it mean when I reach 
 Maturity 
 And still see that I'm not the mayor of 
 My 
 Mayonnaise, the master of my milieu. 
 At least I have a swing and a few 
 Things 
 On my mind, it's never a good nighty 
 Night 
 Just a rise 'n' shine. Why's the rhyme 
 So important. Why do I have to be so 
 Potent and blow the mic a flow 
 Without 
 Chokin' - I don't. I'm arrogant and 
 Outspoken 
 Mouth no token I'm just a roust about. 
 I have a house and clout but I don't 
 Come tight 
 But it's routine since few fiend for true 
 Hip-Hop. It's a trip when I drop my style 
 And forget it and forget where I got it 
 From and how I got 'em sprung 
 'Cause I'm 
 Stuck on myself and I depend on my 
 Luck 
 And wealth for health matters so I 
 Don't 
 Explode with stress I'll serve you an 
 Elf 
 Platter they'll tell me my shit is fatter 
 Than the first but I'm a light sleepin' 
 Rapper in a hearst 
 I don't wear sarongs in my songs. 
 I diss 
 The skirts in verses an I used to 
 Measure 
 My demeters with clever panometers 
 But 
 I bounced like a pogo and I'm solo 
 With 
 The hobos. A nocturnal colonel in a 
 Journal 
 I put fly kids' eyelids to rest a detour 
 For Deep sleep when I freak beats I snap 
 Like a defective contraceptive and my 
 Sleep 
 Will be light, so you'll know that I'm 
 Tight
