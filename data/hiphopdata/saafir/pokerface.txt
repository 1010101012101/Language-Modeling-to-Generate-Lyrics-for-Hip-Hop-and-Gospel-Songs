 (Nobody move) 
 Smoothe Da Hustler 
 Ugh, yeah, ugh, yeah, now fuck that 
 Check this out, man, youknowmsayin'? 
 All you niggas with them muthafuckin' pokerface on 
 And don't know how to pull no real ass cards 
 You step your punk ass back into the plaster, nigga 
 You understand me? I'm not tryin' to feel you 
 Straight up 
 Pokerface 
 Cash in your chips, I'm hot, I got the fever 
 Where the dealer? 
 Nobody move, it's my turn 
 I'm shakin' the dice of life with a tight grip 
 I'm flippin' the numbers, mayn 
 A hustler that be lovin' pain 
 You better watch the dice 'cause they be runnin' game 
 The name don't fit the face mask and all my whole nine 
 You [unverified] with a .45 
 And I bust it through your pokerface 
 'Cause I know it's fake and simple [unverified] pimp 
 Seein' through your face like [unverified] 
 On a hoe named Pimples 
 Yeah, that's what you covered with 
 Pits all in your face, no deeper than dimples 
 Niggas is shallow but I'm knowin' 
 'Cause I got the nostrils that knows I'm the shit 
 Smell me, really do [unverified] a lots intoxants 
 You can't peep me, keep my face, 
 You frostbitten freaky 
 My grill stayin' in 3-d 
 You, you, you can't, can't, can't see 
 See, see me, me, me 
 Who got the dice so I can take your life 
 Cash in your chips, I'm hot 
 I got the fever sittin' on a block of ice 
 Still can't peep me, keep my face 
 You frostbitten freaky and I stay cocked 
 You cats is rappin' with jokerlips 
 With them corny ass stiff comedian ass ingredients 
 Fly niggas get broke like kites 
 (What?) 
 When you gamblin' for your life 
 With only two poker chips 
 Strip, click-clack, you know that shit 
 Niggas shakin' the dice like mice runnin' a rat race 
 Well in that case rewind a nigga twice like Christ 
 I'm rockin' his daddy's ice 
 (That's some cold shit) 
 We give a fuck about ridin' a trick in a Six 
 Or decoratin' a vagina with diamonds 
 Playas that need to get traded 
 And dropped off on a slave island in the Caymans 
 A granddaddy at phrasin' 
 And a master at assemblin' ass in pasture 
 When it's grazin', I'll pull your broad like a horse 
 And I'm holding the reins 'cause I'm alway reignin' 
 I'm always flamin', I stay high when I'm bustin' 
 I stay cock-poppin' 
 You cocky-ass Rocky's 
 And lady, I ain't the father of your baby, hoe 
 When your pokerface look like mashed potatoes 
 And gravy though, you need to eat, huh? 
 You look the part but you don't walk the talk 
 The toes are like ten lies on your feet 
 When you speak no heed 
 You couldn't bake big pies with the recipe 
 If I leave you in a darkest den 
 You likes to see the rest of me 
 Pokerface 
 Who got the dice so I can take your life 
 Cash in your chips, I'm hot 
 I got the fever sittin' on a block of ice 
 Still can't peep me, keep my face 
 You frostbitten freaky and I stay cocked 
 My pokerface is so straight 
 I can buy the painting of Mona Lisa with a visa 
 Or you can invest in me 
 A real shark at the bottom of an infested sea 
 The style is on the run, my rap sheets is deep 
 But the hip hop police ain't arrestin' me 
 Move that vehicle, this ain't the streets you park on 
 Start dippin' into some parkin' lot pimpin' 
 Move out that marked zone 
 Unplug your microphone and turn on your VCR 
 And watch this porno star 
 Leave your ass like gas 
 Stuck and fucked and mad 
 Rippin' the doors off the hinges 
 Jealous niggas wanna kill me 
 'Cause I'm in they hood like a engine 
 I'm just idlin' with a game of God fame 
 And broads got you doin' strict crossovers like Iverson 
 These herbs be herbed, Chinese vitamins? 
 Nah, these niggas need verbs 
 That's so cold to keep hype niggas in furs 
 I'm gone, one, bum ass dumb nigga 
 My pokerface got nerves 
 Who got the dice so I can take your life 
 Cash in your chips, I'm hot 
 I got the fever sittin' on a block of ice 
 Still can't peep me, keep my face 
 You frostbitten freaky and I stay cocked
