Another massive dose I'm sendin' in 
 Hittin' when I step back to the deck 
 Sidebets kick 'em in then raise up 
 Jet from the ivory it's time for me 
 To see if I can graze the cut 
 Just a hint I'm shuttin' down 
 Ya pistons you'll have to listen 
 'Cause I'm clippin' of the wack 
 Bracket shit that's soft so go 
 Back to the troft and put it 
 Back next to the Smirnoff bottle 
 Where you found it from it sounds 
 Numb has no feel an organic 
 Synthesis did I mention this in 
 The last verse no I drive a fast 
 Hearse they'll have to catch the 
 Flow I'm snatchin' a row of burnt 
 Corpses and hopin' they lernt the 
 Forces that they're up against the 
 Immense in this shit will a 
 Fist to the grill instill a fraction 
 Of common sense you would want 
 Providence to play a part but it's 
 Obvious you have no heart I'm 
 Protruding a pro-tracker the 
 Proportion of a slacker is where I 
 Store 
 The shit give me ya cup what's ya 
 Flavor it's juice taste it a swig of 
 The stew 
 Now that I have a deepdish spoon 
 Niggas be attackin' get blackin' 
 Eyes like racoons blew up like 
 Balloons busted rusted they're 
 Getting thrusted with them 
 Screw drivers who's the livest 
 Me and I love it when the 
 Slug rubs another from a rusty 
 Life they couldn't cut it so I cut 
 'Em with my trusty knife 
 Skinned alive and when deprived 
 Of one's life one thinks twice 
 Three time a lady Lionel couldn't 
 Pay or you to fade me 'cause 
 I be learnin' shit makin' 
 Ternikits for broken English 
 I'm yokin' the seamstress 'cause 
 I'm sewin' up shit. You know 
 I can rip, I rest with the 
 Hobo's yo yo's stay up no 
 Mayonnaise on the cut but I can 
 Bust it wit the mustard my 
 Spice is hot the radish 
 Adds this seasoning that creates 
 And make taste buds wanna make 
 Dubs 
 Of a swig of the stew 
 Box Car 23 is my freight train 
 I'm not strippin' for the cock except 
 The Diesel the weight gain I make pain 
 And 
 I take it 'cause I'm humble a dirty rat 
 A sturdy gat is the back up for the 
 Smack up easy for me to pack the 
 Knack 
 Up braggadocio rhymes I'm braggin' 
 While 
 I'm laggin' saggin' 'cause my jeans 
 Hafta 
 Be lean for the cuisine who dat! Dick 
 Dasturdly could never master 
 Me drew raps after me comes me 
 Stop 
 Suction cupping you got nothing 
 Coming 
 But cum of burns hon. I'm doin' it 
 For my niggas in the oak-land where 
 I plan my escape from traits of empty 
 Crates and busted grapes are not 
 Part of the gomay hey just an 
 Appetizer filet mignon but the song 
 Is the stew
