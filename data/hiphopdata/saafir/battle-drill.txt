Boxcar sessionist black magic is 
 The magnet breakin' 'em down to 
 Micro fragments. I might go dragnet 
 Shoot joe on Friday if I miss I'll 
 Get your one day won't forget officer 
 Monday I'm good with gun play I get 
 Wreck check the boss don't remove 
 Your firing pin punk 'cause I get 
 Off - comes the safety freak a clip 
 Or get plugged with the four - 5th 
 Off my niggas hip best believe the 
 Triggers gettin' gripped we stroll 
 The back doors to the railroad is 
 Where we go when we flow hell 
 Knows 
 And elbows are shot thrown don't 
 Blink 
 An eye gets ruff when I flex the 
 Ingrim chrome don't even try it. 
 I'm the arsonist 'cause I'll burn you 
 With the slug I'm funky plus I got 
 Carpet fresh in my rug tug a war and 
 Get dug six feet under floor plans are 
 Banned 
 Combat hand to hand cowards clocks 
 Is gettin' cleaned with detergent if 
 You want to freak a funky flow we 
 Can splurge it so I'll perk like an 
 Expert I'll send a flow that'll kill 
 Bet I won't break a sweat in a 
 Battle drill 
 Start ya engines but you look 
 Exhausted like carbon monoxide 
 I'm sly 
 Like a foxeye see me I'll jack you 
 For your bundle g I'll be lurking 
 In the rear smirking when you're 
 Crumbling the hobo junctionist 
 Function 
 Is to freak the lyrical smoke a 
 Blunt to the grill till we reach 
 The spiritual world then get wit ya 
 Girl dip her like a tea bag up it 
 Another notch for the flea bag king 
 Queens be freaky fiends don't sleep 
 And 
 Fall think the cocks the bomb but like 
 Tom you'll get brokawf sheer energy 
 So you know I be stockin' rear entities 
 Eatin' linto beans and I do reek when 
 I speak true who's this ya girl nice 
 To freak you let me freak a clip slip 
 One 
 In the chamber click clak that's the 
 Sound of the gat right before the jack 
 Comes true I thought you knew 
 That's ya cue oh! but you're a hero 
 Muscles kinda swollen but you ain't 
 Real you wouldn't strike if we was 
 Bowlin' to the left march arch ya 
 Back the impact is fat when I tag a 
 Grill 
 With a battle drill 
 The nomadic attic dweller never 
 On the cheddar cheese grease down 
 The plank yankin' mentals clean 
 Slates 
 Are freaked treats for the tricks like 
 A magician doin' halftucks genies and 
 Arabian's chest be cavin' in and I be 
 In the rubbish rubbin' this like aladdin 
 Through obstacles my saliva be 
 Liva than stoppin' flows in they tracks 
 Cuttin' the tape it's nutthin' to debate 
 Fate tells me this is the last grape 
 To be cracked rippin' the plaque 
 Between the gums hums this lift ya 
 Lip a little more to the chef's recipe 
 For flavor they be beggin' me to stop 
 The torturing but forth I bring 
 A subconscience which means no conscienceness 
 On this effort no mercy on a groove 
 No 
 Space to move check mate it's 
 Reserved 
 For the disinfecting I'm projecting 
 Flavor till you choke chalk 
 One add a kill for the battle drills
