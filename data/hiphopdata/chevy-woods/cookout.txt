(Wiz Khalifa - Intro) 
 And that's a round of applause 
 Ladies and gentleman 
 I'd like to shout out Taylor Gang 
 And shout out my car keys 
 It's big business bitch. 
 (Chevy Woods - Chorus) 
 I'm just chilling, loc'ing, sipping, smoking 
 Like a G Should 
 On my fly old school shit: Clint Eastwood 
 Tell a friend, bring a friend, it's a Cookout 
 We gon' drink, we gon' smoke 
 We gon' turn this bitch out 
 (Chevy Woods - Verse 1) 
 Roll another doobie 
 Only papers, baby fill it with that ooh-wee 
 Let a G roll the OG, than roll one for OG 
 Yeah that's the homie 
 Zig zags baby no leaf 
 Acting like you know the Wizzle man, that's my homie 
 If that's gin nigga, pour me 
 Sippin' slow, she go down slow like a slow leaf 
 Cop the car from the dealer 
 Pulled off thumbs up to the homie Mac Miller 
 King kong young gorillia, my cup overflow with ? spilla 
 All day Mr. Count It Up, I lost count I don't ever think its enough 
 I get it 100 after 100 so everything you did with that money I done done it 
 Gone! 
 (Chevy Woods - Chorus) 
 I'm just chilling, loc'ing, sipping, smoking 
 Like a G Should 
 On my fly oldschool shit: Clint Eastwood 
 Tell a friend, bring a friend, it's a Cookout 
 We gon' drink, we gon' smoke 
 We gon' turn this bitch out 
 (Chevy Woods - Verse 2) 
 Drop top, leather seats 
 Tape deck playing, she a freak 
 It ain't about money, it ain't my language 
 Don't know my name in memory of Rick James Bitch! 
 You know that I'm a Taylor tho? 
 So to the cops Cartoon George "which way'd he go?" 
 Shit, n-gga I did blew 80 O's, the 80's O's the 80 mo' 
 In my lifetime, No Jay Z 
 Just Oz's, roll something, smoke weed. 
 Drink liquor, double cups 
 No lean in it, f-ck is up. 
 I tell her "bitch, I be airborne" 
 Then in a minute in my lap where her hair gone 
 She Keep it G, she love a n-gga 
 I tell her chill, I'm f-cking witcha 
 (Chevy Woods - Chorus) 
 I'm just chilling, loc'ing, sipping, smoking 
 Like a G Should 
 On my fly oldschool shit: Clint Eastwood 
 Tell a friend, bring a friend, it's a Cookout 
 We gon' drink, we gon' smoke 
 We gon' turn this bitch out 
 I'ma roll one up, and you should 
 We gon' smoke old school joints: Clint Eastwood 
 I'm gon roll one up, and you should 
 We gon' smoke old school joints: Clint Eastwood 
 (Wiz Khalifa - Verse 3) 
 Uh, best board the time machine bitch 
 You can write a movie off the shit I done seen 
 Rolling them Khalifa papers up with all kinds of green 
 Smoking while I'm rapping n-gga, don't get no time between 
 Yeah I came up in the game, it took time you see 
 I'll show you how to get your money up and get high as me 
 Talk to my Dad the other day said he proud of me 
 My girl says she found 30 racks when she found my jeans 
 I told her blow it, like her nose was running 
 What you hatin' me for fam, get some hoes or something 
 N-ggas know me for twisting a whole key 
 F-ck around I might charge you a O or something 
 I'm a let you hold it and you owe us nothing 
 It's the shit I be smoking so be careful how you roll it when you cuffin' 
 Got a projecter in the crib like nino 
 N-ggas ain't gotta talk about it, we know. 
 (Chevy Woods - Chorus) 
 I'm just chilling, loc'ing, sipping, smoking 
 Like a G Should 
 On my fly oldschool shit: Clint Eastwood 
 Tell a friend, bring a friend, it's a Cookout
