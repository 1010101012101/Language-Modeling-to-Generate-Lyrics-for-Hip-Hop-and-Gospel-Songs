You don't really wanna leave her but you're tired of her 
 She know you don't love her either and you lie to her 
 But if I was her I would be on you day and night 
 I'd take back what's mine because your kind is hard to find 
 But if she ain't gon' be watching means you gotta skip 
 Skip to the lady with that - ooh - because she well equipped 
 Forget your pride, let me free your mind 
 Let me get you high, boy I do just what you like 
 'Cause I'm down for everything you need and who you are 
 And my door is always open and I'm never far 
 You are the star 
 You tell me the story 'bout who was right before me 
 And how she became boring, you make her look so corny 
 You ain't in love with her but she still lives in your heart 
 But you be in my apartment, tearing me apart and 
 Jingling my jewelry 
 You don't know what you do to me 
 I feel like you be using me 
 I know that's where you choose to be 
 And she stay where you choose to stay 
 Not try'na make you choose today 
 I'm try'na get you through the pain 
 I'm try'na smoke this buddha babe 
 You know what's up 
 You said you need to roll another O 
 Because I'm here for a reason and you know what 
 I need some love, oh, I want some love 
 Oh I need some love, oh, I want some love 
 Oh I need some love, oh, I want some love 
 Oh I need some love, oh, I want some love, want some love 
 Oh I need some love, oh, I want some love 
 Oh I need some love, oh, I want some love 
 Oh I need some love, oh, I want some love 
 Oh I need some love, oh, I want some, want some love
