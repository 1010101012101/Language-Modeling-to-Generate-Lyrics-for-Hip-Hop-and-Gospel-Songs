Tonight's the night the mood is right 
 Anything I choose he buys I observe by his shoes and ties 
 He prefer the exclusive kind converse over booze and wine 
 Tonight's the night the jewels is bright anyway I move he like 
 He is searching for cutie pie he could scoop and sign keep a blue dressed down to my Louboutins 
 Keep my calm keep my cool 
 Heard you got a girlfriend but she's a deuce 
 Do you wanna see a little bambi in the nude chocolate candy liqorice too 
 Wanna book a ticket get physical soon 
 Head of the class but I got prinicipals too 
 Arching my back give em' a view 
 He wanna taste the cinnamon too 
 Sex is a race and I'm winnin' it too 
 I'm a rude bitch but I like gentlemen 
 Who spend dividends, benji's, residuals too 
 When he put it in I'm rememberin' you 
 Who's his girlfriend never a clue what? 
 Girl if it's all right, we'll both make love and get it on tonight 
 I got a girl but you look good tonight (you look so good baby) 
 It's one on one tonight, tonight (ha, ha) 
 Drink in my hand hand on my chip 
 A vamp bitch do it like this 
 Here with your man hand on my hip 
 A bad bitch do it like this

 (Verse Two) 
 These weak bitches talkin' out of their neck 
 Banks 'bout money power respect 
 Old girl on powderin necks 
 Old girl owe some power, respect 
 Niggas took the flower then jet 
 Should've stuck to the script instead of suckin' on sect 
 Bump on the dick never forget these niggas is hexxed 
 Nasty
