Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I'm on that Marylin 
 She got that Adam's apple and she asked about that passion 
 And we passed her with laughter and passed her whacker friend 
 Piece to the keys with that covered if they the keys that act up in 
 It's beasts in the streets and feathers and 
 She put a decent effort in but she's at the precinct hemorrhaging 
 Bring it to these bitches like Alpo 
 Bitches getting stitches if she under my scalpel 
 Bitches getting vicious when I tell 'em who the sight's on 
 Have these girls runnin' like roaches with the lights on 
 They been on that groupie shit 
 We been on that Gucci shit 
 Apple Cherry coochi clique 
 Mmm, mmm, yeah 
 Y'all be swearin' you the shit 
 But y'all be sharin' shoes and shit 
 Cool it, bitch 
 Yeah, we ain't getting paid for 
 'Cause I can't entertain you 
 I got nothing to say to ya 
 (No, no) 
 I don't even blame you 
 If I was you I'd hate too 
 You can't even fuck with us 
 Can't even fuck with us 
 (Oh, I) 
 You can't even fuck with us 
 Can't even fuck with us 
 These bitches fadin', they poppin' shit 
 And they hatin' 'cause we are 
 We the crème de la crème 
 All them other bitches are the H to the I-Ms 
 These niggas like her 
 They try to get in her cypher but he can't 
 Can't even roll text with us 
 These niggas can't even stand next to us 
 Trust, that I seen these bros be 
 Tryna make ends meet, Pantene Pro-V 
 Try to send beats to her and he's hoping 
 He can get a 16, he can get me open 
 But, um, I ain't fuckin' with these hipster niggas 
 These niggas really like sista niggas 
 You know, they sweeter than them spritzer niggas 
 I know niggas probably kissed a nigga 
 I know niggas probably dicked a nigga 
 Anyway, it's the B-A-N-K-S 
 To them niggas with V-I-S-A 
 C-A-S-H E-U-R-Os 
 Put a couple commas in them Z-E-R-Os 
 Lookin' for the dollars for the C-O-I-Ns 
 You need to get enough for both me and my friends 
 Yeah, we're more dimes than two bucks 
 These niggas be up in the hood like Ku Klux 
 Puffing on that loose again 
 Puffing on that 2 for 10 
 All these niggas oodling, noodling 
 Yeah, yeah, y'all niggas cool and shit 
 But all my bitches too legit we are 
 'Cause I can't entertain you 
 I got nothing to say to ya 
 (No, no) 
 I don't even blame you 
 If I was you I'd hate too 
 You can't even fuck with us 
 Can't even fuck with us 
 (Oh, I) 
 You can't even fuck with us 
 Can't even fuck with us
