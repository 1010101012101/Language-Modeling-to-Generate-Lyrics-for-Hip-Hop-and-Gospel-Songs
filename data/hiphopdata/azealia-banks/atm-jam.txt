 Ayo P,

 Iz you with that butter shit- that, that bonne vie? 
 Did you divvy, did you double dig that-? 
 That song sings- freaky deeky whistle-wetter, 
 Slip that slit, that thong thing (HA!) 
 Hyphy-cheeky-cheddar-checker, 
 Get her own cheese, that's a chicken with her head off, 
 That's that bitch that won't be wit her 
 Official with that with that whole steez, 
 Flight-fleety-feather-witch that whip that long weave nigga 
 They shootin' in the parking lot, 
 Everybody get low, 
 They shootin' in the parking lot, 
 That ain't where you wanna go... 
 Now stand by a soldier, stand by a soldier 
 And work it- whip that muthafuckin ass like I told ya!

 Ice the berg, white's the fur 
 Ims in the house like nice suburb. 
 Pipes on her pout, might pipe the purr 
 Peter pipe been about my pint for sure! 
 Ims a mermaid, rhymes the nurse, 
 I'm little red ride-ride the verse 
 My shimmy shake's inside the shirt, 
 Should a dyke and a gay guy try to flirt
