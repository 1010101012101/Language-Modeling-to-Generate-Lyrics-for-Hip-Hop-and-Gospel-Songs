Aight 
 Yeah 
 (Diamond) 
 Yo, I make people congregate like I'm off to a light 
 Roll at least 20 deep like I'm off to a fight 
 Frontin' off fake MC's, busy caught in the hype 
 I sleep all day long, let 'em off in the night 
 Recline with dimes and chill, and blow me a breeze 
 While your broke ass is home eat-in bologna and cheese 
 Feelin' like an idi' but its only the trees 
 Beat-in your girl in the head, please loan me the keys 
 While I be at the Pocono's, strokin hoes 
 I had the wing-on shorty, and left his ass with a broken nose 
 Jelly 'cause I pull cinn-i-mon buns, I dig 'em out on the first night 
 (Chadio) 
 Right? Hit 'em and run 
 (Diamond) 
 But not, without my rain coat 
 I continue to stack legal tender, while other MC's remain broke 
 You lame jokes, came close, cause you hate us 
 No longer on a hiatus 
 (Ladies, ladies, ladies) 
 (Chadio) 
 Chadio 
 What cha'll know about the home, or the hop, to the hip 
 What cha'll know about the home, or the glock, and the clip 
 BX, where I, see techs and G checks 
 Fightin and squeeze with the natural re-flex 
 Cru baby, forget about if, ands, and maybes 
 Bitin the seeds who like to bi-catch rabies 
 Bustin' at all we try to bring the damn fall 
 See life ain't all about rhymes and ram ball 
 It's deeper than that, so I'm keepin' the gat 
 Caught the evilest ones, who wanna sneak an attack 
 Come back like that cooked up crack and glass pot 
 Hot like you be sittin' up in the hash spot 
 Blwowin spots like malator cocktail 
 Steal mic-ro-phones and lead glock shells 
 Bronx born, Bronx bred and Bronx raised 
 If you Bronx torn, Bronx dead in the Bronx grave 
 It's all about my daughter, I wanna be able to say 
 "I'll order a champagne 5 and a quarter" 
 So long live Cru and the Diamond in the Ruff 
 Section, we keep protection, never bluff 
 (Yogi) 
 I'm infinite as an SP-loo, I'm feelin' my self 
 Bronx with the shine and I'm Bronx with the rhyme 
 And if I'm Bronx with the crime nada, but over niggas 
 With my Lex and my Range Rover, nigga 
 I keep real simple now for all y'all slow niggas 
 You can-not see me Chad or Diamond D 
 Yogi got that, like "Baby got back" 
 Like Yogi got crack, lacin tracks to make it love all these gats (yeah) 
 Y'all don't wanna catch a pitch that's wild 
 But I wanna catch a bitch that wild, and show that bitch my style 
 In the meanwhile it's all about the hiatus, remix Diamond laced 
 I love the attention when playas hate us 
 BX body X-rays but I can't 
 Givin' your riot a center phobia BX bringin' extra 
 The love of what, like we be Diggin In The Crates, for tracks 
 We'll be diggin in the crates for decks 
 But as I hit, a lot of real shit, I spit 
 As real as this tape I'm rhyming on, I quit 
 I have you know my Mansa 
 I have you wearing red socks like Boston 
 That's my trick-a-down, ill
