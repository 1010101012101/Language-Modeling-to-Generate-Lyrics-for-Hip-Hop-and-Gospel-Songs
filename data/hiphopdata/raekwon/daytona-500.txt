We are the G, O-D's 
 And we came to rock, the spot 
 Like Ironman Starks 
 They be the illest MC's, in the world today 
 Cappa Raekwon and the R-Z-A 
 So listen to them clear, and put the box right near your ear 
 Light your blunts and down your beers 
 Cause you could never fuck with Wu-Tang Killer Bees 
 (Raekwon the Chef) 
 Say peace to cats who rock mack knowledge 
 Knowledgists, street astrologists 
 Light up the mic God, knowledge this 
 Fly joints that carried your points 
 Corolla Motorola holder 
 Play it God, he pack over the shoulder 
 Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise 
 Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives 
 Rapel on fakes like reflectors 
 He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career 
 We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna 
 Run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo 
 And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break 
 Break down an eighth and then wait drop it like Drake 
 Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing 
 Claim they doing the same shit we doing, fuck your union 
 It's the same style, RZA trainable, jump the turn style 
 On the alley tried to challenge God for the new vials 
 Especially that, aluminum bat in the act 
 Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black 
 The Mac-10 flex white cats like Windex 
 Index finger be sore, busting these fly scripts 
 The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans 
 Laying with my bitches and my man's in Lex Lands 
 We losing em, jet to the stash and now Jerusalem 
 Abusing em, rocking his jewels like we using 'em 
 Low pro star, seven thick waves rock Polar 
 Roll with the older God, build with the Son and the Star 
 All these MC's start realizing 
 That Ghost got that shit, that'll keep you vibing 
 The Wu is here to bring, you Shaolin's finest 
 But if your shields are weak, you better step behind us 
 (Ghostface Killer) 
 Mercury raps is roughed then God just shown like taps 
 Red and white Wally's that match, bend my baseball hat 
 Doing forever shit, like pissing out the window on turnpikes 
 Robbin niggas for leathers, high swiping on dirt bikes 
 Voice be metal like Von Harper radio bubble 
 Murder sleep away camp, the fly lady champ 
 The arsonist, who burn with his pen regardless 
 Slaying all these earthlings and fake foreigners 
 In the Philippines, pick herbal beans, bubbling strings 
 Body chemical cream, we burn kerosene 
 The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon 
 Long-heads inscriptions with three sixes in 
 Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive 
 I slap box with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph 
 Zooming like binoculars, the rap blacksmith 
 Money's Rolex, with sparkles, Chef ragtop is spotless 
 I'm Iron Man no cheap cash metal I'm steel alloy 
 True identity hidden inside secret tabloids 
 Breathe oxygen both sides of my jaw carry oxes 
 The track hit like the bangers, in hundred watt boxes 
 Yo jostling these cats while Little J be deli-ing 
 Sip Irish Moss out of Widelians 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Give me the the fifty thou, small bills 
 My gold plate, my slang kills 
 My Benz spills, what up Lils 
 Murder one Dunn 
 Killer bee stung, guess who back home Son 
 My technique of slang camp won, third platoon soon 
 Cristal bottles, cages of boom, probably wardrobe 
 The mad-hatter big dick style, beware goons 
 Smuggle balloons, lord of dooms, in fat pussy wombs 
 Let the Gods build, pull up the grill 
 Check out the mad skills 
 Top secret technique, too hard for you to peep it 
 And keep it, jiggy style of rap and watching knuckle slang 
 Sweep it out of order tape recorder can't record my slaughter 
 Spoil the rotten Don is too good to be forgotten 
 High top notch, borderline rhymes is handcocked 
 Ninety-six, my ill sound clash is still hot 
 Get yourself shot
