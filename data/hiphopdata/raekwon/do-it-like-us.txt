I drop fifty on the order, more hundred on the whip 
 Five on the louis luggage, ten on the trip 
 Sour when I land a little, something for the hip 
 Fiji or roset, and I don't even take a sip 
 Nah, they don't do it like we do 
 Nah, they don't do it like us 
 Nah, they don't do it like we do 
 Nah, they don't do it like us 
 Yeah, donnie laughing at you sore losers 
 Underdogs hot, 2011 hoosiers 
 That's cruisers that's jumped off from back flipping pussies 
 Splash, I get all them clothes smelling cushy 
 Shades on, aviator lens 
 Mami sitting in my benz, like she liz claiborne 
 That you already rolled, now it's hella flame, on 
 Little model bitch, had to get game, on 
 Yeah, the hood say I'm on fire 
 Donnie on the street like a good year, tire 
 Still look the same and that's last years, flyer 
 Just more money, but way more, higher 
 I drop fifty on the order, more hundred on the whip 
 Five on the louis luggage, ten on the trip 
 Sour when I land a little, something for the hip 
 Fiji or roset, and I don't even take a sip 
 Nah, they don't do it like we do 
 Nah, they don't do it like us 
 Nah, they don't do it like we do 
 Nah, they don't do it like us 
 Aiyo, benz and grams being torn from the rubber bands 
 Latifah shorts, tennis courts in the summer man's 
 Skydiving in fiji islands with a sweet view 
 Balley parachutes, the water is deep blue 
 Micro felt goggles, brazil models, keep a mouth full 
 While I'm hitting they back tonsils 
 Me and sheek is selleck and george clooney 
 A Russian chef with scars on his chest, the boats mad roomy 
 Only niggas that move good pots to the rasta 
 Switzerland, we flying in vet to examine the watches 
 And we ain't gotta throw ice on 'em, we count one for kiss 
 Styles, rae and cap, l and mike and 'em 
 I drop fifty on the order, more hundred on the whip 
 Five on the louis luggage, ten on the trip 
 Sour when I land a little, something for the hip 
 Fiji or roset, and I don't even take a sip 
 Nah, they don't do it like we do 
 Nah, they don't do it like us 
 Nah, they don't do it like we do 
 Nah, they don't do it like us 
 Aiyo, two hundred thousand in dust paper 
 Let a bullet thrust, take your jacob, I'm always in make-up 
 Under your trucks, scottish ruger, jump suiter 
 Rad little slut, one white killa with bucks on 
 Wearing jewelry, robbing jewelry, peep out the coats 
 I switch pockets then pull out the scope 
 Niggas is dice, y'all famous for the legendary clarks 
 Lamping in junior's, eating squid, me and starks 
 Chatting quiet, no talking, just finger jabbing 
 Sheepskins grey, beneath the feet, crisp balley 
 D&c kangols, white Russian gazelles 
 Keep a track on the sickest bat like modell's 
 I drop fifty on the order, more hundred on the whip 
 Five on the louis luggage, ten on the trip 
 Sour when I land a little, something for the hip 
 Fiji or roset, and I don't even take a sip 
 Nah, they don't do it like we do 
 Nah, they don't do it like us 
 Nah, they don't do it like we do 
 Nah, they don't do it like us
