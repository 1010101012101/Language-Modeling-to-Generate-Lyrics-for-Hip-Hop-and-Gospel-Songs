Choppin' like a lumberjack up in the gate 
 One plate, a rock on the table, movin that flake 
 Yeah fiends start hittin' my shit 
 Paranoid, he got the convoy all up in his crib 
 One nigga sick, fuck it 
 Let's get this money, got the razor clackin' 
 In my jean jacket a little scale 
 Some baggies and a mean ratchet 
 Now I start baggin' away 
 Fiends is comin', yo 
 Took off my shirt, murked that away 
 How many you want? Like 17 
 Shits is golden, daddy, play ya part lil' soldier 
 Better beam, and now we start blazin' the place 
 Coke all in my skin, eyes is burnin' now I'm wipin' my face 
 The shit's good, right? Best in the town 
 My little Dominican man and them blessed me 
 Big prices let me wrestle 'em down 
 Keys is like 20 a joint, for you, gimme 14 
 Flood 'em wit dimes and give ya niggas joints 
 Suge Knight the building, take the town over 
 Then I woke up, there's blood on my left thumb 
 I bagged over now I start casin' the crib 
 Basin', 80 a gram kicked off the Playstation 
 Now the whole lab is mine 
 First niggas was lyin', mad hundreds start growin' in line 
 Yo the shit's love shakes and a dimensional caps 
 You want sick love, buy like one invincible pack 
 You get this stuff, you gon' see residuals back 
 You just a dig-dug, you can't even hit me wit facts 
 I just bugged on 'em 
 Played the rug on 'em 
 2 for 9, you my nigga got love for 'im 
 He hid it in the pot, said 'Ah yes' and 'This is destined' 
 Flashback to his culture, he Mexican 
 You all that, slick politician wit'cha raw rap? 
 You can sell from anywhere to jail? Nigga fall back 
 You be stashin' shit all in the mailboxes, all that? 
 You just as real as them niggas on the callback? 
 Yo son let it loose man 
 You got a lotta G to juice son 
 Here go 4 more, man 
 Word up, man, go wash ya hands, man 
 Word up man, go pour me some juice or somethin' 
 Word up man 
 Come see me though, for real for real
