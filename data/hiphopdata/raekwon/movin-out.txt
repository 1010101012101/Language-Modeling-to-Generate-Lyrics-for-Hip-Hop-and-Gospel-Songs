 Yo, aiyyo 
 Yo select meat, gucci sneaker recipe light up the nestle 
 Bless me es-pecially, play where vettes be seen a 
 Green beemer, lightin cheeba 
 Side swipe adina dressed like a liter style off the meter 
 Play towards regulate laws with heavyweight broads 
 Don't jock niggaz who floss, money ain't yours 
 Jealous of yourself, watermelon tellin' herself 
 Rather fuck around with a felon, more love smellin 
 Fendi bag high-willie in jag, gorilla mag 
 Blow you out the back, throw your broke ass in the gap 
 Analyze see it like that, felt you love be it like that 
 Still, I'm realer than the illest on wax 
 Rockin' brims that hang low, frames sweeter than a mango 
 Flame actin' like a lame though, how your game go 
 Fine, exercise mind play the train yo 
 Aiyyo you dead on the chain, now watch my name blow 
 (Mya) 
 I'll be movin' on 
 So far from where you are 
 Should I let you know the code 
 Cause you wasn't what you seemed 
 And now I'm wishin on all the rainbows 
 That I see 
 That someday you'll regret what you 
 Done to me 
 And I never thought you would hurt me boy 
 But now I know 
 That's why you're gonna see me walk so fast 
 Through the door, uh-huh 
 I think it's time for us to break up, ba-by 
 We should have never ever been together 
 You tried to play me but baby I had enough 
 So I'll be, movin' up 
 (Noreaga) 
 You are leaving, on the next plain 
 And movin' on cause things ain't just the same 
 How could you do that, when nore lace the smooth track 
 And I'm the one that gave stella her groove back 
 The two mack, you see my peoples playin' the cut 
 We thugged out, you know the ones that, say what what 
 So don't you, need a thug girl, get with a thug pearl 
 Shorty say I keep 'em wet like waterworld 
 I'm kind of busy doin' mtv 
 So call me later why'all I think I'm the see-p-t, or 
 Polly with mya, in d.c. 
 Doin' calypso, it's all about me, so ask sisqo 
 And "don't let it go to your head," now 
 N.o.r.e., I'm still good in the bed now 
 And we can break up, move on and don't make up 
 The last kiss or none of that, like a running back 
 Got a little cheeba so what? I got tons of that 
 Noreaga, you know the underground thundercat 
 (Mya) 
 Shit be real in here, shit be real in here 
 Uh-uh, shit be real in here, shit be real in here 
 Boy I'm movin' on 
 So far from where you are 
 Should I let you know the code 
 Cause you wasn't what you seemed 
 And now I'm wishin on all the rainbows 
 That I see 
 That someday you'll regret what you 
 Done to me 
 And I never thought you would hurt me boy 
 But now I know 
 That's why you're gonna see me walk so fast 
 Through the door, uh-huh 
 (Noreaga) 
 I keep it live like a grid wire, you know I ain't a liar 
 N.o.r.e., raekwon and lady mya 
 Star collab' it, the wire just grab it 
 And if you see me with shorty, yo I'm stabbin it 
 (Raekwon) 
 Yo nor' we used to bump like fly newlyweds, get drunk 
 Fuck and bump beds, rock dumps together, ice on her hand 
 Broadway junction the function, union square there 
 You follow me, for a year before you had hair 
 Actin' like you got me on mack, you wack 
 I shoulda blowed it off, kept that ass flat 
 Mya blow the track 
 (Mya) 
 I'll be movin' on 
 So far from where you are 
 Should I let you know the code 
 Cause you wasn't what you seemed 
 Boy I'm movin' on 
 So far from where you are...
