Old school players to new school fools 
 'Kast keep it jumpin' like kangaroos 
 But skew it on the bar-be 
 We ain't trying to lose 
 Say 'I be got dammit they done changed the rules 
 The common denominator, the nigga numerator 
 Never know who the hater, niggaz cater to your ego 
 I'm sorry like Atari whose the cousin to Coleco, Vision 
 Caught a Rico, back on the street like Chico, DeBarge 
 He large and got a 'Llac in the garage 
 Few parts here and there, I declare hard, my lawd 
 One at Clark, one at Spellman 
 Both know each other and it's cool, you can tell when 
 He step off in the party women jump for joy 
 But all the wild niggas schemin' they gon' jump the boy 
 For spittin' all that bourgeois, my watch, my car 
 I'm a star, I'd rather be a comet by far 
 Deliver this through your audio, ghetto mafioso 
 Grow hydro, then bag it up yo 
 Price that longevity, suggest make moves 
 Slow take time grow eight, react nine blow 
 Hydro slide raw like fuck Renaldo 
 Fly ride though, shit lookin' wild dope 
 Then glide yo, flippin' the page, I go 
 Watch five-oh, jump on my meat, ride slow 
 Watch those, undercovers, cop those, rock those, glocks blows 
 Leave 'em baggy and collect spot grows 
 Keep a watch froze, lean on the yacht and wash clothes 
 Let the chop' blow, bag a half a block plot grows, what? 
 Boi, I bust raps like D-boys bust gats, shit 
 We the type of people that don't bury the axe 
 Or the hatchet, every time we see your link we snatch it 
 Ridin' round our hood talking that dumb shit, your cabbage 
 Is cracked, like plumber's ass, and summer's grass 
 I been in the game for a minute, seen some suckers like y'all passin' 
 Thinkin' you're light skinned, all right then, lil' boy why you frightened? 
 The Dungeon Family gon' be here nigga so keep writing 
 I gotta hit The Source, I need my other half a mic 
 Because that "Southerplayalisticadillacmuzik" was a classic, right! 
 College Park, East Pointe and Decatur they got my back, so 
 We gon' keep on jammin' and stabbin' off in the track, 
 Think it's time to bungee but buddy we will be back 
 And I'm fin' to put some D's on the 'Llac, know dat!
