[Intro: Raekwon] Niggas got me the behind the pot again 
 But yo [Raekwon] The Pyrex is bubbling 
 The stove is broke Fuck it 
 Use the flame from the oven 
 The famous dozen Bout to hit the streets 
 They buzzing 
 Break it down 
 Yo Chop it like he raided your luggage Major yellow shit in the pot 
 Struggling Trying to form a rock up 
 And double it 
 And call up my cousin What up beloved? Stab it 
 Tilt and twirl 
 Spit in it Plus put a little bit of milk in 
 Fiends love it Sat back 
 Confident in comfort 
 The light blew out All I see is all white stuff 
 Suds in it Four hundred razors in a bucket 
 Seventy plates We thinking ten mil a man 
 Nigga 
 Fuck it It's on 
 Get the baking soda 
 Dump it How many niggas'll pump to get eighty more? Get it jumping Live by the code and we thumping Nigga take this 
 Fuck around and taste a flake bitch 
 You drunk it It's all in the eyes of the hungry It's all for the wise and the humbly 
 The rise came upon me
