 Verse One: Nas 
 Through tha lights, cam'ras, n action, glama glittas in gold. 
 I unfold, tha scroll. Plant seeds ta stampede tha globe. 
 When I'm deceased, by then tha beasta rise like yeast 
 Ta conquer peace, leavin' savages ta roam in tha streets. 
 Live on tha run; police payin' me ta give in my gun. 
 Trick my wisdom, wit tha system that imprisoned my son. 
 Smoke a gold leaf. I hold heat, nonchalantly. 
 I'm raunchy, but things I do is real. It never haunts me, 
 While, funny style niggaz roll in tha pile. 
 Roosta heads profile on a bus ta Riker's Isle, 
 Holdin' weed inside they pussy wit they minds 
 On tha pretty things in life. Props is a true thugs wife. 
 It's like a cycle; niggaz come home, some'll go in, 
 Do a bullet, come back, do tha same shit again. 
 From tha womb to tha tomb, presume tha unpredictable. 
 Guns salute life, rapidly, that's tha ritual. 
 Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef 
 Perhaps bullets bust niggaz discuss mad money 
 True lies and white guys, we can see it through the eyes 
 Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate 
 Pyrex pots, we break, fiends lickin' plates 
 In the building niggaz building, like little children starin' 
 Them older niggaz ain't carin 
 Sirens circlin fiends are lurkin in your baggage 
 Oh, one's gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage 
 In the woodwork, crack cells bubble like Woolworth's 
 In the projects, richest niggaz rockin' all the real worth 
 Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in 
 Tradin in they Lexus' GS's sendin messages 
 Two and two makes four, Cristal's crazily pour 
 Gun wars my crew phantom like swords 
 Verse Three: Ghostface Killer 
 With the green leathers, hunded pound snakes and cakes 
 Fiends found in lakes, jeolously Jakes we shake 
 What I strive for is what I live for 
 Infatuated by material things, and it's wild like for war 
 Like somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold 
 Future stacks yo I hold 
 Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox 
 Don't keep jack in my lap, don't wanna see Tupac 
 Got two spots, a new lot, flooded with rocks 
 Shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops Bad Tony and the ball drop 
 In the Now, I'm bangin' niggaz for slide time 
 Hurry up Duke I'm next, show 'em mine 
 And what the fuck is you looking at? 
 By the way young blood, hit me off with that Green Bay hat 
 Watch your back inside the hall, new niggaz slide through 
 Like doors yo, you're starin' in the mess hall 
 Your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindlin 
 New jacks surrenderin, come home not rememberin 
 Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt 
 Lookin' gay in the yard, and you got hurt 
 Flashbacks, of the day room, mop ringer style 
 Your faggot ass got bashed tryin' to turn the dial 
 You told your boo you was whylin 
 Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin 
 High class cooks, throw on vestes out of phone books 
 Infirmary niggas are screaming, "I got drugs!" 
 Sharpen toothbrushes 190 mixed with baby oil and shit 
 Your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks 
 Well I'ma end this with a big red cherry on top 
 Me, Nas and Rae got the best product on the block 
 [Rae] Strength my whole team is eatin off this type of shit 
 [Ghf] Word up, throw your hands up 
 [Rae] Good shit, nigga next time, no more whatever shit 
 [Ghf] Cock back the Mac an say whatever 
 [Rae] Keep your eyes open and your wallet in your front pocket 
 [Ghf] Your Hawaiian's stale, exoticness, fly shit 
 [Rae] RZA Chef Ghost and Nas niggaz is the prophet 
 [Ghf] Floatin on in nine-five in the basement
