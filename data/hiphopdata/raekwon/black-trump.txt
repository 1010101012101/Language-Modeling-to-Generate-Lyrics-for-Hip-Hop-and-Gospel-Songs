 {Straight blazin'} 
 Blazin' through 
 Blazin' through 
 Blazin' through 
 Blazin' through 
 Blazin' through 
 Blazin' through 
 Pack mode time to strike like a cobra 
 Poisonous venom through your system killin' you slower 
 Niggas blowin' through each other 
 ? 
 ? 
 You know me son show respect when I'm rockin' the? 
 Steam rollin' on niggas my team straight blowin' 'em 
 Got 'em throwin' they gunz in tha air like Onyx 
 Test the Smif-n-wessun, crew niggas? 
 Let me warn y'all killas upstairs, I see all y'all 
 Heavy like balls, niggas I might blow y'all 
 Your ammo see y'all court block, blowin' up ya ammo 
 Handle gun on the ledge I might blow his hand off 
 Lookin' at you wide like fuck you probably think I'm high 
 What, chain around my like bluff, headin for Egypt 
 Hennessey drink, mahogany guns 
 Trees duck, come out yo shirt 
 Buckle knees duck, like a rag nigga, throw some weed up 
 It's Casablanca rag throw some g's up 
 Let's poly slow motion status, bring the keys up 
 Wonderin' runners is lookin' mighty feesed up 
 Right suit bitch F-B-I throw his gunz up 
 Vegaz money niggaz holdin' gunz 
 Armed for the lift, bustin', pussy's up 
 Yo baby need new shoes and a outfit 
 I see ya stick up kidz ya come wit, the dick lick 
 Swing hit limp from bushwick 
 Two hits wit da to deck shit 
 Ya heard about 'em now open up ya shirt 
 And sew the tag see green 
 Ya double, if ya triple, ya bitch push me 
 Got a poly wit ya crew stickin' loot up 
 Ya big up weight throw ya boots up 
 If ya step into da club wit ya gunz up 
 Puttin' pictures on mine ta raze da roof up 
 Gotta keep it in da fam, check, check it out 
 Minolta flash, gun in da stash 
 Homin for both hats 
 Tek why ya slap fire out em, hold fast 
 Bitchez gotta pay da hard way, Allah swingin' on 'em 
 Like a San Diego Padre 
 You first went da godz way, say lets start way 
 Professional marksmen, swimmin' like killin' sharks 
 We leak, feelin' heartless 
 On point like a dart shit 
 Bomb Yo camp if you want this 
 Connect with convicts, on some John shit 
 Switch do camouflage, cat get the money in fact 
 Go to war like Japan, if you push and do dat 
 Keep his movements to 3, when he out in da streetz 
 Keep the stash filled with high heat, when drove the streetz 
 Keep the ghetto bashers, when in your crib like to mash men 
 When I run wit a tek and we ain't askin', we blastin' 
 Chef wit da extra cannon from Staten 
 Rhyme official live, bust caps when makin' 'it happen 
 You gotta make power moves, black gunz and cash rule 
 Hold my eight straight, 'cause I been payin' dues 
 Wave kid from way back tryin' to make a mil stack 
 When Miami money cats will leave you layin' down flat 
 (Repeat: x7) 
 Raze da roof up, word up 
 (Repeat: x6) 
 Guess who's the Black trump
