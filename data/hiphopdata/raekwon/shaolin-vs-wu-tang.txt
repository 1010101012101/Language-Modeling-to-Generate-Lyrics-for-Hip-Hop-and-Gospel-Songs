Master 
 Toad style, hmmph 
 The Shaolin deliberately tried to use the Lord 
 To learn our Wu-Tang sword fighting 
 The Shaolin would never do that 
 Wouldn't you? 
 The Shaolin have always looked down on us 
 Are you afraid the Wu-Tang would become more famous than you? 
 You? 
 So you used your Shaolin poison 
 To set up my master and deliberately frame me 
 That's nonsense 
 It's not nonsense, I saw it myself 
 Nonsense 
 The Shaolin have nothing to fear from the Wu-Tang 
 But our sword fight 
 Yo, aiyo 
 Villagers, gangstas, pillagers, paintbrush 
 New whips, blue fifths, Louis Shallah, shit 
 Ostrich turtlenecks, the Chef already reps 
 Lean off the petty jets, we buy the very best 
 Outfits, powerful rich, pouncers, camel clips 
 One bump, two lumps, a shotgun, a new jumps 
 With flying bird, buying herb, new kick, designer birds 
 She on it, we up, let's re-up and free'd up 
 Jake's hate it, Rae made it, clientele, we gon' sell 
 You gon' starve, he gon' jail, night boots, swim with whales 
 Better snub, surgical leather gloves, never loved 
 We gon' kill, take it to the Hill, we forever real 
 Old records, old luggage, you ill with no budget 
 You shoot and we spray, kill off them old buzzards 
 We love it, can't stand it, you read, the Wu Manual 
 We found it, stay grounded, we will, we still scrambling 
 Hey, hey, hold your fire, stop 
 You two traitors, you've mixed the Shaolin and Wu-Tang 
 No, we have not, it's just that they're the same 
 That's right, my Lord, you misunderstand our Kung-Fu work 
 It doesn't belong to anybody, it evolves 
 Kill 'em 
 The wrist lifter, the grave sitter, baby sitter 
 The jaw twister, open the vault, call your sister 
 Pyrex her up in the file, live as Twister 
 Blunt rolling, only a robe on, some whiskers 
 Knee slapper, the gat packer, black jacker 
 Extortionist, friendly as shit, Bob and Back-lur 
 Ones folder over the stove, gold rover 
 The gear dresser, the chop bagger, Marvin Haggler 
 Rap stabber, eat you alive, gold tarantula 
 Sixteen paces and blow, hold the heckler 
 Pimp style, Axel Foley, stolen Rolly 
 All ya niggas that know me, y'all owe me 
 I don't give a damn 
 Listen 
 Ha, ha, ha 
 And I'll kill anyone who dares to go against me
