Since rap got locked right before we visit the 90's 
 Chef in the kitchen cookin' up wit the crimeys 
 It's late Fall, dime season 
 We bought the crib next to Bill Clinton mother 'cause she fuck wit the Chinese 
 They hit niggas wit heron, there's 14 of us 
 Beamers, won't stop pitchin' the Chevron 
 It's packed kid, black kids don't know how to act 
 They flashin' Macs, Gilettes, a couple of stacks 
 Yo, the system's oopid 
 Yup, shorty wit the dunks on, the dunks get provided and swoop kid 
 And bloodhounds is hatin' 
 They knowin' how the kid get down 
 Silent shottys wit grenades, I'm waitin' 
 And everybody love vintage 
 You see like 4, 5 niggas wit half-moons and wave intentions 
 What's really good? 
 The 'dro hit 'em, killed him in the hotel 
 Heard he had some old chick wit 'im 
 That's how we make it happen 
 That's how we break it down 
 Hood all day nigga 
 Watch how we take the town 
 That's how we do the do 
 Just know who is who 
 Acknowledge me all day and understand 
 Wu is Wu 
 Yo but on the other side of town it's Tony 
 Laid up 
 This white chick wanna gargle my nuts 
 I put the Bailey's down, tapped the blunt out 
 Grabbed her by her hair, watched blondie love whip my dick out 
 Spit drippin' down my balls, she slobber me 
 That's right, suck that dick, get it hard for me 
 Pyrex in one hand, large amount of grams in it rocked up 
 And she pregnant, my lil' man got her knocked up 
 He popped up (oh shit!) 
 I'm like a crooked cop, Richard Gere 
 Big smirk on, getting' my cock sucked 
 He pulled the joint out, a bullet spun out 
 But it was too late 
 Already nutted on the side of her mouth 
 Side of her face and hair like Somethin' About Mary 
 I can't front, my son gun look scary 
 Chill, she's a whore 
 You knew it from the time we ran trains on her 
 And you still fucked her raw 
 C'mon son, gimme the gun 
 You gonna kill me over this bum-ass bitch you can't resist? 
 Remember Vell had her in the Telly, takin' the fist? 
 Watch how you aimin' that shit 
 You should be aimin' at Trish 
 She take a bone like a rib-eye steak at Ruth Chris 
 Yo be easy on the trigger son, you squeezin' the fifth 
 I only did it just to show you she's the easiest bitch 
 He came close, had to duff him, nigga gimme that shit 
 That's how we make it happen 
 That's how we break it down 
 Hood all day nigga 
 Watch how we take the town 
 That's how we do the do 
 Just know who is who 
 Acknowledge me all day and understand 
 Wu is Wu
