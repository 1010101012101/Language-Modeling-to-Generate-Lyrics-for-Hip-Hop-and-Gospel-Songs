(Intro: Raekwon) 
 Uh-huh, what up son? Yeah 
 Maintaining, maintaining, you know? 
 You good, right? Everything proper, still, right? 
 Of course, come on, man, what's the matter wit you, man? 
 Ain't nothing, I just want us to be on 
 (Chorus: Method Man) 
 Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W 
 Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a suu 
 Get it right, all my chicks hold ya tits, let's get it in 
 All my niggas take a toke off this weed, let it begin 
 Here we go, yo, y'all already know what it do 
 Brand new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu 
 Now throw ya W's up, back from the slums, it be the Wu 
 (Raekwon) 
 Love to dress a lad, get rocked, hundred bags, black doorags 
 Ski masks is on, g-wags 
 Don't try to take pictures, relax, still in the grass 
 You'll learn respect, burst when I ask 
 Rhyme master busy, wizzy on the subject 
 Love Deck, thug battle, drug vest, snub sets, iller than most 
 Night time toast, gorillas in boats, three votes 
 Villains is killa, gangstas flip notes 
 Hibernation yo, switch up, liver nation, fly information 
 Vivid vacation, deliberation moments 
 Move like '91 Romans, cloning everything 
 Gents only, the rent's on the stove, I'm in Rome 
 Maxed out, Amex style, my team gram bandits 
 Make a move and get blown off the planet, baby 
 Hold that cannon, just understand we got the whole shit 
 Padlocked down, my niggas won't have it 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Aiyo, jumping out of Benz wagons, my family live in the Hill 
 They call us Bin Ladins, laughing, turbaned up 
 Fuck around get murdered up, these streets is like radio beef 
 So watch how the kid turn it up 
 Bulletproof tuxes, knuckle gauge clobbering busters 
 Eighteen niggas, bringing the ruckus 
 Flame throwers on our backs and shoulders, the rusty joints still work 
 The trey eight'll blow one in your douljah 
 When it's mad heat I'm mad calm, walk around 
 Go collect, 36, over G bomb 
 My inner strength flowing, I mastered chi kung 
 Y'all Planet of the Apes, standing next to King Kong 
 Forensic files, ultraviolet hype, sky blue Bowels 
 Laying niggas like ceramic tile 
 I'm like Urlacher, beasting at the top of the pile 
 Kneeing niggas in the nuts, goddamn damn I'm foul 
 (Method Man) 
 We blow money, got game, hungry, we pop things 
 Look bummy, grams in my pocket, Chef cook for me 
 Blue Magic bundles, I'm dope, but on the humble 
 I'm a good dude, don't short change me, see that's a hood rule 
 Beer drinkin', Cuban Linking, new way of thinking 
 God me thinking meth, break the handcuffs, run out the precinct 
 This is hard body, hard knocks, if you pushing that hard rock 
 Then let these niggas know off top 
 We rock fitted, dropkick it, I lived it if not quit it 
 I pitched it, my pops sniffed it, need business, I'm not finished 
 I'm *sniff* too hot wit it, you bitching, the plot thicken 
 I'm shitting the glock, spitting, if nigga don't stop snitching 
 Just what the block missing, the two-seater wit the top missing 
 And two divas wit they tops missing 
 Now that's living to me, I'm what these kids is killing to be 
 But I don't want my children to be
