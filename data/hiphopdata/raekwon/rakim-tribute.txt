(Intro: Raekwon) 
 Yeah, what, what, yeah 
 Shout out the 18th letter, you know? 
 Word up... we gon' do it like this 
 And pay homage to the most livest 
 Yeah... yo... 
 (Raekwon) 
 I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke 
 Now I slam it when I'm done, give me my ten G coat 
 To perform another song, 'cause I won't let 
 Nobody press up and mess up, the scene I wet 
 I like to stand in the crowd, and watch niggas wonder 
 Damn, then think about, then you wonder 
 Clan, they just rag shit, rip shit, bruise shit 
 Maybe that's the rap shit, I gotta prove shit 
 Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm 
 Now flip the beat up, convert it to a hip hop joint 
 Write a rhyme and graffiti in, every show you see me in 
 Deep concentration, swift like the beamer, kid 
 Go with the crowd, while my lyrics spit flames 
 I flow-tate the vowel, 'cause it's all in my veins 
 Another remedy, fly niggas is enemy 
 'Cause I'm live as some rap niggas with energy 
 Now do it, 'cause I'mma put the nine on pause 
 My sharks beaming, catch you on the side of the store 
 Call your bluff, make you stare in my face, ya team suck 
 Remember me? The one you got your ideas from 
 How soon you start to suffer, until you get stuck up 
 When you start to fuck up, that's when you get bucked up 
 Bitin me, you think you dope, I smash your boat, with bad coke 
 You should of wrote, because I ain't no joke 
 (Chorus 2X: Ultra) 
 It's been a long time, I shouldn't have let you 
 Without a re-up to connect to 
 Think of all the weak product you slept through 
 Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you 
 (Raekwon) 
 I was a fiend, before I was seventeen 
 I melt the microphone like blowing some evergreen 
 It's all in the making, from where hip hop was originated 
 Peace to the streets, the bubblers, mark and dated 
 'Cause I grab the mic, now I say "yes y'all" 
 Y'all yell 'scrape it', then I'mma say 'let's ball' 
 Come on, cool, 'cause I'mma get on rep 
 Twist a 'dro on the speaker, pull the snub and then flex 
 Back to them crabs, y'all niggas had y'all laughs 
 And then I spaz on the rhymes I splashed 
 From back to your brother gun, then I grab the double pump 
 Then this the opposite, and ask if another come 
 'Cause I'mma get busy, get dough with my team, yup 
 I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean? 
 I'm raging, rip up the stage and don't it amazing 
 'Cause every line is laid in 
 Caught up, thoughts are sort a, an addiction 
 Bags of pies, smell of bricks, kid 
 Vocals vocabulary, the stage is a suction 
 The mic is a draino, volcanos erupting 
 Lines overblowing, gradually glowing 
 Every thing is written in the cold, slick and coin' 
 Slide... my thoughts'll glide 
 Forty-eight MAC's and knives 
 The invincible, microphone fiend, Raekwon 
 Spread the word, 'cause it's on 
 B-E-R-E-A-L, a smooth operator with notorious crack sales
