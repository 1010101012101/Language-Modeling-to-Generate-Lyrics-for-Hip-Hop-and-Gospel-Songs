(Joi Starr (Ghostface Killah)) 
 I, can't, leave these streets alone, no more (Yeah, yo) 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Aiyo, I'm skinned up, Nikes is scuffed, still bugging 
 Earlier, around four, how I escaped the bus 
 The way I fell, cracked the face of my watch, my man's chanting me on 
 Like run, son, don't go up in the spot 
 Jetting through bushes and backyards, neighbors is ratting me out 
 Dogs is barking all you hear is the cars 
 Sirens, I'm trying to think, and toss the iron 
 Bomb in my sweats, got me running funny, you think I'm lying 
 May God strike me, if he don't like me, I'm tired and I'm out of breath 
 The weed got me paranoid, my heart's pounding through my chest 
 Trying to focus, yup, and make progress 
 That's what I get for slinging in them projects 
 Next thing you knew, I'm in this bitch's crib, chilling 
 Told 'em my story, you'll like this, I had her legs in the ceiling 
 Cooking me fried fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits 
 While she doing this, the bitch still sliding on lipstick 
 Now I got the fat stomach on, she cracking the Dutch 
 Playing with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck 
 Like come here, miss Lady Wop, where you put the condom box 
 You finished off the last one, oh shit, I hear the cops 
 Handcuffs and talkies, I mashed the white yorkie 
 Jetting up the steps, and pig want revenge like Porky's 
 So I slid, hid behind the wall, opened the door 
 Like 'ooh', I seen my man Meth going in raw 
 So he jumped up, balls out, hid in the closet 
 I'm dying laughing, he said "Yo, Starks, be quiet" 
 (Method Man) 
 And let me put my drawers on, nigga, what dope you on, shit? 
 Should of knocked, before you came in the spot, Ghost, you wrong 
 Busting in here on that government shit, got the chick screaming 
 Grabbing the sheets, trying to cover her tits 
 She's asthmatic and you laughing, son, I bumped my toe all the nice things 
 Just run and try to grab the gun 
 'Cause shit's real, man, you spazzing dunn 
 There come a time in a man's life, he got to toss his pack and run 
 You know he family like Crack and Pun, but Mr. G.F.K. 
 State your business, after that, be one 
 Now can it be that you hot, lord, you did some shit on the block 
 That the cops trying to lock you for 
 Can't believe you blowing the spot, lord, my chick is bugging 
 You tripping, my dick keep slipping out my boxer drawers 
 Now I'm caught up in the drug sting, niggas is calling my horn 
 Police is hitting every corner we on 
 Can't understand that it's a thug thing, and in the middle of thought 
 I'm interrupted by Shallah Raekwon 
 (Raekwon) 
 I need my money, Meth, going on about them hundred birds 
 Tell Tone to get at me, on 'em and my clients want work 
 He know we fresh out, tell the kid meet me, matter fact, beep me 
 Word to mother, lord, sunny got me hurt 
 You still fucking shorty? I knew it, the big mouth broad 
 That be yoking my balls out, her little brother wanted two bricks 
 You know that nigga 'Lipps, he Maybach, on 26 
 All he do is get money, hustle, he's a dick 
 Tell me foul shit, wild shit, y'all niggas wear a lot a loud shit 
 Yo, that Steve Rifkin style, shit 
 Hit me with some other talk, him in New York 
 They love the Venezuela nigga, stabbed his son with a fork 
 That was Jesus roofs, his little niece 
 Little niece, his father's homework 
 That's the kid who gave us a boost 
 He gave them things on the arms, said for us to be calm 
 And if some beef pop off, go 'head and ring the alarm
