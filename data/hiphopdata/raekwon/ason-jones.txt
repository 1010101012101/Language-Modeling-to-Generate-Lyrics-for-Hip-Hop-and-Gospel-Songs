Intro:word I miss you, I miss the god 
 Word... a powerful brother, man, he was live 
 Raekwon:he was a powerful general, the smell from his breathe was ballantine this it was the year 89' 
 He stayed the freshest, polo boots, wallies with them colorful low goose 
 Coming from Medina, we boost 
 We up in A&S, slipping and dipping to bedstuy 
 Native, he used to beatbox, thousands'll listen 
 Yo, that's before, the wu got on, him and allah just' 
 And RZA, came to the island one morn' 
 A nigga could dance to slow music, outdrink any nigga 
 On the benches, while we hitting reefer, he sold loosies 
 Five foot seven a legend was born, Russel "ason" Jones 
 I know for his braids and lessons 
 A wiseman with knowledge 120, kept a flag on his chest 
 A right hand, you quick, serving you remy 
 Yo, lets toadt to the fallen, lost forgotten 
 Aiyo, if niggas could hear me, then roll up some broccoli 
 Ason, the heart of a lion, a purified mind 
 The way he did it, with a mic and some wine 
 I would never forget the days we used to sit back 
 Days I be all up in the crib, listening, holding, align him and yo I just miss this nigga 
 And now I understand the meaning of love when I kissed the nigga 
 Interlude:ol dirty bastard (sample) 
 My name is ol dirty bastard, youknowhatimsayin? 
 I don't hide nothing back, I barely, I mean, I come from a family, man of poor welfare, youknowhatimsaying? 
 When I came out my mother womb I was on welfare, youknowhatimsaying 
 So so so it's like you got to keep it real nahwhatimean? 
 Raekwon: 
 He had a heart of gold, intelligent soul from day one 
 Loud as the ferry, best friend was momma Cherry 
 Sweet lady, BK baby, she taught Dirty 
 How to cook, clean, singing the songs, say the 
 Old school dances and O.E., Ballantine, the wine 
 We sip, while we sat with the O.G.'s 
 Knowledge of self, good health 
 The fortunes that came with the game, had my brother insane 
 It's like wealth ain't enough to live for 
 But if you got love in your heart, just believe in yourself 
 That was the black man rap, baby Jesus in the black Land' 
 Few jewelry pieces with his gold fangs, his fam 
 (Brooklyn Zu) you know my brother was ill 
 The first dude to say, "Yo, keep it real" 
 Yeah, the lover, the father, the hustler, the rap professor 
 Now he with Allah, that's a blessing 
 (Interlude: ~Ol' Dirty Bastard Sample~) 
 See, it's like, ok, where I come from 
 In my neighborhood, my people know me 
 Youknowhatimsaying? See, if I try to come any different 
 They ain't gon' respect me no more 
 Youknowhatimsaying? Because they -- you know people 
 Got their thing about themselves, you know 
 If you come from the neighborhood, youknowhatimsaying 
 You couldn't, you couldn't get out the neighborhood 
 But you could never take the neighborhood out of the people 
 Youknowhatimsaying, but if you try to like jump and crossover 
 To the other side, people understand that, and they don't like that 
 That's why they don't be buying people music 
 See, we keeps it real, and we always gon' keep it real 
 You can't knock what's real, youknowhatimsaying? We telling the truth, man
