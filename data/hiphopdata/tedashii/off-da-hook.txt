Oh yes, you know it's on again, this for my souled out believers who been born again Yes, oh, you know we born in sin but through the resurrected Lamb we all been born to win Cause at birth sin, we born into this thing, placed at odds with the Father, sworn enemies main And we grow up from the time of inception with lies and deception, obeying our lust hoping that God'll accept us But oh, no this joint is serious main, unrepentant sin in life, it get's Him furious main No, oh please don't trust yourself, trying to carry sin's weight you'll crush yourself So when your flesh start rising just hush yourself and put no trust in this world, it's gon rust and melt So, get down like the bomb's been dropped, and trust the Father with your life before your time is out

 Oh, yes so peep the scene on the earth stacks of green, racks of lean, plus the green from the earth Yes, oh, man's in love with himself and anything done good he thinks he does it himself So he trust himself to pay the price for sin thinking if he's good enough then he can get on in But oh, no he can't handle the weight cause the judgment of sin is too great We broke the law, man we broke 'em all, we deserve the penalty to get broken off But He brought me back, took the cross for that, got me off the hook, told me walk in that We all stand to stand trial so I stand and say loud if you stand for anything then stand to stand down And put your trust in the God above, even though we fall short He's still a God of love
