 Now you know that you should leave the streets, puffing sweets, chasing cash from week to week, but you won't because you fiend to see your dreams Owning a house at that place where you can see the beach and easily get them girls that you can see that leave the beach So she can be your stand for one night in between the sheets and then you leave, hop inside your 'Lac so you can peep the scene You keep it clean gripping on the grain as you sip the lean, swanging mean, sinning like a pimp? Brush your shoulders off You can live like a boss, you can floss like a boss, pay the cost to rep the North, rock a cross and still be lost Cause without the savior no neighbor no paper, no Jacob no make-up could make up the break up, but make us forsake the Creator That's why we need a Savior that's why I'm hollering out Jesus, drowning in our sin and we need Him to come retrieve us Believe us it's time you stopped trusting in yourself, plus your wealth, lay aside every weight before you crush yourself 
 Houston we have a problem, we have a problem, Houston we have a problem, we have a problem 
 So meet the thesis for my reading the bottom line is you need Him, plus we're weak and we feening By nature to keep on leaving, chasing beauty that's fleeting forsaking how we are breathing Replacing Jesus with bondage, like boppers, dollars, and pieces He died to bring us all freedom and rose so we could all meet Him, I know you heard this on Easter, but feast your eyes on the reason God would crucify His seeding when we ain't nothing but heathens, love made Him cling to a tree when we deserved to be beaten All that so we ain't gotta trust ourself, trust our health, trust our wealth, it don't even make no sense 'cause it's gon rust and melt Is it the grain, is it the gal, is it the grill? Or is it Christ who paid the price so you could live Or would you rather burn up in Hell for a mill? I doubt it, you missing that Christians are only Christians in Him Although we live forever right now we living better, 'cause if you ain't living by grace you'll die by the letter
