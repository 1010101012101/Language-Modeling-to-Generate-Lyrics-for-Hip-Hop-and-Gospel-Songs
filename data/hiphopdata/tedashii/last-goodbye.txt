I don't wanna be alone 
 I don't wanna be alone 
 I don't wanna be alone 
 I don't wanna be alone 
 I don't wanna be alone 
 I don't wanna be alone 
 Uh, tears hit her cheeks, like Tyson's glove, 
 Pain hit his heart, as she fights for love, 
 She says don't go, but the call came, 
 It's time to deploy, and they called his name, 
 Close to zero five-hundred, her mind starts wanderin 
 Butterflies, tummy starts rumblin, 
 Queezy, uneasy, tryin' to hold it all together, 
 She doesn't want their last moments here to be 
 Unpleasent, 
 The car ride is quiet, outside it's hard to fight it, 
 Inside it's like she's dyin', that's when she started cryin, 
 He tries to comfort her, "Baby, it's all right" "Liar!" 
 That's what she screams louder from the thoughts of 
 Fight, 
 They pray, it's okay, "I'll promise that I'll be safe" uh, 
 That's what he tells her as he looks her in the face 
 And as he walks away, lookin' in her eye 
 Last kiss as they say... 
 Chorus Benjah 
 "I pray this is not our last goodbye... Goodbye" 
 "I pray this is not our last goodbye... Goodbye" 
 Uh, graduation; her nine weeks are done 
 Hoorah, Hooplah, now it's time to move on 
 Leavin' out of basic, she just got her assignment 
 She's headed off to war and it's hard for her to face it 
 (Or face her), the daughter that she's leavin' 
 It's hard to come to terms with the truth, no one 
 Believes it 
 And even when it's starrin' in ya face, you don't 
 Receive it, 
 She hears mommy, and it's just like her heart 
 Stopped beatin' 
 (Beatin'... beatin') inhales heavy breathin 
 Worried when she leaves she may not be back to 
 See them, 
 Her baby girl, and the family that she loves 
 Tryin' to hold back the tears right now is 
 Tough 
 She fights to stay strong, gotta hold on 
 She says a prayer, just tryin' to find a calm 
 Thoughts of eternity, then back to reality 
 And then she tells her family... 
 "I pray this is not our last goodbye... Goodbye" 
 "I pray this is not our last goodbye... Goodbye"
