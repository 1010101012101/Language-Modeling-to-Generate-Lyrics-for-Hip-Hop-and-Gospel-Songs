(Verse 1 - Lecrae) 
 Real skinny, loud colored tenni's 
 Body marked up like graffiti 
 I don't push a Maserati, Beamer, Benz or Bentley 
 And yeah I roll the Ford, at least I'm lookin' spiffy 
 Hey go ahead and doubt us, but whatchu know about us? 
 And we ain't gotta follow them, we take another route 
 No we ain't blowin' trees bro, open up my window 
 I see you poppin' tags but you know that's why your [money] is low 
 I tried to tell 'em we was comin', gon' let us in 
 Why they hatin' like we all a bunch of hooligans? 
 No gimmicks, Spirit in my lyrics 
 Know when people hear it they gon' love or they gon' fear it 
 And how we flow 'cause when we show up at a show 
 They say we goin' so hard in the paint they can't wait for some more 
 But some others say we preachy, some closed-minded teachings 
 Like we ain't heard of Marx, Locke and Nietzsche? Believe me 
 (Hook - Lecrae and Tedashii) 
 They don't know about us 
 They don't-they don't know about us 
 They don't know about us 
 They-they-they don't know about us 
 They don't know about us 
 They don't-they don't 
 They think we dum dum diddy dum dum 
 But they gon' know, they gon' know about us 
 They gon' know about us 
 Aye they gon' know about us 
 They-they-they gon' know about us 
 They gon' know about us 
 They-they-they gon' know about us 
 They gon' know about us, they gon' know about us 
 (Verse 2 - Tedashii) 
 6'2", two plus, gon' add it up 
 Hey there's a big problem, call it calculus 
 Math don't subtract but content like I had enough 
 Long hair, don't care, Samoan plus I'm tattered up 
 I know this blow your mind that I ain't blowin' pine 
 Not talkin' women lookin' skimpy every other line 
 Yeah I got a dime, about to make her mine 
 Life in Christ got me finished like I crossed the line 
 With the way that you tellin' me to do it 
 Sellout to sellout, nah man it's so foolish 
 Done tryna be you and don't fit 
 Misfit, I don't trip, everybody hate Chris 
 They sayin' get with this, just like a membership 
 They talkin' slick like this is it, but it's just gibberish 
 I say I'm interested, they say "you different" 
 Oh you gon' know even if you don't let us in 
 (Hook - Lecrae and Tedashii) 
 They don't know about us 
 They don't-they don't know about us 
 They don't know about us 
 They-they-they don't know about us 
 They don't know about us 
 They don't-they don't 
 They think we dum dum diddy dum dum 
 But they gon' know, they gon' know about us 
 They gon' know about us 
 Aye they gon' know about us 
 They-they-they gon' know about us 
 They gon' know about us 
 They-they-they gon' know about us 
 They gon' know about us, they gon' know about us 
 (Hook - Tedashii) 
 They say we (dum dum) 
 They say we (dum dum) 
 They say we (dum) 
 So we finna go ... 
 Dum on 'em, dum on 'em like I could be 
 Dum on 'em, d-d-dum on 'em like you should be 
 Dum on 'em, dum on 'em like I would be 
 Dum on 'em, d-d-dum on 'em, yeah that's cool with me 
 (Hook - Lecrae and Tedashii) 
 They don't know about us 
 They don't-they don't know about us 
 They don't know about us

 They don't know about us 
 They don't-they don't 
 They think we dum dum diddy dum dum 
 But they gon' know, they gon' know about us
