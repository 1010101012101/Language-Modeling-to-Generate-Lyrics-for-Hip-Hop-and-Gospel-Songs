Peep it, peep it 
 Oh my god! 
 Pe-peep these people fiending 
 Fiending to be seen as king and leaning 
 In they, CHROMED OUT CARS 
 Ri-riding high, su-superfly 
 Wood wheel, they grasp it tight 
 Locomotive midnight strolling through Georgia 
 They Gladys Knight 
 Tipping, neon glass is bright 
 Switches make the back take flight 
 Lay it down, raise it up 
 Stu-stunting gives 'em bragging rights 
 All this so they swag is tight 
 Idolatry for status right 
 But they blind to the prison and the image that they living in 
 All this sin from Adam's vice 
 All of us we get this, yeah 
 Distorted views of image, yeah 
 Made in God's likeness but despite this mankind is blemished, yeah 
 So men chase them fancy cars 
 Riding on them fancy bars 
 All so they can get respect when we cruising down the boulevard 
 So I grab the mic in here 
 Just to bring some light in here 
 Flip-flip the script just like a switch to spark this hit 
 Bring Christ in here 
 Since man can't see who they should be 
 I'm a spit this so they can see 
 Outside of Christ you're bound for life 
 A slave to your Idolatry 
 Self proclaimed kings bragging 'cause they on chrome 
 But 26 inches is a pretty low throne 
 They riding on chrome 
 On chrome 
 On chrome 
 A pretty low throne 
 Low throne 
 Low throne 
 On chrome 
 On chrome 
 On chrome 
 Low throne 
 Low throne 
 Low throne
