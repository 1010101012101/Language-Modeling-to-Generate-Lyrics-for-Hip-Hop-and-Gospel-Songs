(Hook - Lecrae and Trip Lee) 
 You can see the way I changed 
 New swag new talk new frame 
 Not who I used to be 
 Transformed now you should get used to me 
 You can see the way I changed 
 New swag new talk new frame 
 Not who I used to be 
 Transformed now you should get used to me 
 (Verse 1 - Lecrae) 
 A new swag new walk new focus 
 It's all Christ not me no boastin' 
 And let me show you how to do this son 
 If you follow the old me you's a foolish one 
 Was a decepticon, or a decept and con 
 I get you for your last dollar then an extra one 
 Christ changed that, you should spit change 
 Rap 'bout how I'm getting change, now I'm doin' it to change cats 
 Folks see me and they like "he a thug" 
 But I tell 'em "look closer 'cause I'm covered in his blood" 
 I'm transformed, I don't do that there 
 You might see me in the street like "who that there?" 
 I walk in the spirit full of peace, full of love 
 Full of truth, full of Christ, paid the price with his blood 
 Now I'm all up in the Word, used to be up in the herb 
 I'm a F-A-N-A... y'all know the word 
 (Hook - Lecrae and Trip Lee) 
 (Verse 2 - Tedashii) 
 Yessir, I'm right back in my second home 
 Feel the tick tock like a metronome 
 Beat knock, is anybody home? 
 Transformed so homie let's get it on 
 (Get it on) 'cause man I ain't the sizame 
 Since the substitute took my place in the gizame 
 Made me brand new and did it all in his nizame 
 Claimed me on the altar to alter the way I thizank 
 So baby what it do man, this is really insane 
 A sinner in my crew till the Lord did his thizang 
 Went from dark to light like Mike without the pizane 
 You might think it's me be but lil' homie know that it ain't 
 So please believe the old me, he dead 
 See in me to seek him instead 
 He's the King of Kings so every knee and head 
 Will need to heed and concede he's head 
 (Hook - Lecrae and Trip Lee) 
 (Verse 3 - Trip Lee) 
 Oh yes, I used to live life all in the flesh 
 With J's and the cash, what, that's a mess 
 With clothes that I bought thought I was fresh 
 But I wasn't fresh at all, I was lost 
 Hollerin' at them girls in the school house halls 
 Tryna ball, ignorant to my flaws 
 Up until the Lord put all that on pause 
 Yes I was blessed to fall at his cross 
 I wasn't a dangerous cat 
 Or tryna aim things point blank range at cats (no sir) 
 But still things was wack 
 Man let me get some things off my chest like my chain was snatched 
 I'm one of his kids you can be today 
 He covered any sin, we can flee away 
 Cling to his cross believe that he raised 
 See the truth, see the life, you can see the way
