(Verse 1 - Tedashii) 
 Uh ... complicated ... man you don't know the half of it 
 Talking to myself I need help, feeling empty like I never had nothing 
 Torture, man it feel like torture 
 It's not like I was out chasing after money tryna get the fame and the fortune, nope 
 Just doing what we always do, care without a clue 
 That's when I got the phone call, man now what I'm supposed to do? 
 Maybe if I would've stayed home ... maybe if I wasn't so busy 
 But maybe is a maybe, a vicious circle that leave you feeling dizzy like ... 
 (Chorus - Christon Gray) 
 I don't know 
 I think I forgot to stop and now I just be on the go 
 I should've been there when you needed me, really I meant to be 
 This wasn't even the plan but it all just went differently 
 It just went differently, yeah 
 Tell me when it got so complicated 
 I don't know, I don't know 
 Never used to be this complicated 
 Maybe I should take it slow 
 (Verse 2 - Tedashii) 
 Slow ... feel like everything moving slo-mo 
 But I recognize this, easy to spot like a logo 
 They say it's the calm before the storm, but how do you prepare, who do you warn? 
 How do you recover once it come, and move on after the damage is done? 
 I don't know everything, everything feel messed up 
 I feel confused, all alone in my home still dressed up 
 In a suit and tie, asking who am I, is the truth a lie 
 Wondering do I cry, am I through with life 
 Man I need to take time and slow it down 
 'Cause you don't know what you be doin' out here, all of my plans they been ruined this year 
 Ain't none of us safe, ain't like you in the clear; foreign to this, bet they new to this here 
 This the only way that I know, life, reminding me of my old life 
 It's all bad and we don't know why, we need to take time and slow it down 
 Man I'm not too different from the rest of y'all; how I'm drowning my pain, you might be a part 
 I'm too busy out here living, I ain't tryna stop; they say I should slow it down but they don't know it all 
 I hear what they sayin' man so do I blow it all? But if I choose to do that then will I blow it all? 
 All I know is I that I'm really trying not to fall; swear this life is complicated, my God 
 (Chorus - Christon Gray) 
 I don't know 
 I think I forgot to stop and now I just be on the go 
 I should've been there when you needed me, really I meant to be 
 This wasn't even the plan but it all just went differently 
 It just went differently, yeah 
 Tell me when it got so complicated 
 I don't know, I don't know 
 Never used to be this complicated 
 Maybe I should take it slow
