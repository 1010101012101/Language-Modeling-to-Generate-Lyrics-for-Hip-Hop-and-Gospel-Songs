I hear so many christians, murmuring about their imperfections, and their failures, and their addiction, and their shortcomings. And I see so little war! Murmur, murmur, murmur. Why am I this way? Make war! 
 Bang with me 
 Ba-bang bang, ba-bang with me 
 No more playing games mane 
 Cause this thang can get risky 
 So mane if you in Christ 
 Take up! 
 Your cross quickly 
 Stand fearless on the frontline 
 Time to come with it 
 Do the right thing 
 Wake up! 
 And let's get it 
 I ain't even in the ring 
 They throwing bows like riddick 
 Persistently attacking me 
 They're even in the back of me 
 It's either fight or loose my life and I can't take this passively 
 So what you think I'm bout to do 
 I'm bout to do what I can do 
 Trust the one who got me through 
 And fight like it was after school 
 Never giving up 
 Steady, standing on the battle field 
 Feet firm to the ground like I stepped on chappel hill 
 Flesh feeling frisky, sin persuades and tempts me 
 Satan cheers me on 
 Guilt followed by conviction 
 It's the same ol' trap 
 And we fall like we defenseless 
 Work your senses 
 Grow in wisdom 
 Stand firm and be relentless 
 I make war! 
 Cause sin never sleeps 
 It's got me in a trance 
 You can see it in my dreams 
 I make war! 
 Man I beat my flesh 
 To the death 
 Every breath 
 Like I beat my chest 
 I make war 
 Sun up 
 I make war 
 Sun down 
 I make war 
 Time in 
 I make war 
 Time out 
 I make war 
 Against lust 
 Against pride 
 Against me 
 Until I die 
 Do you even have a clue 
 What happened to you when he died 
 When that tomb got rolled when he rose in the sky 
 I think we emphasis sin so much 
 That it makes us paralyzed 
 And glorify struggle so much 
 That it makes us terrified 
 And deemphasize the fact that we have been sterilized from our own lives and thus 
 We gotta snap out of it 
 We ain't in no straight-jacket 
 We free 
 When Jesus died in our lives something strange happened 
 He gave us power 
 Yeah I know that we sinners but since he rose he's renewing the image of god in us 
 Now, we gotta start making war 
 Now we can start saying no 
 To them fleshy impulses that Jesus Christ is paying for 
 Now we can start taking the lead 
 Just like the dalai lama and start going all out like a suicide bomber 
 Whatever the sin is we gotta go go go harder 
 By his grace no time to waste and just just just like there's no tomorrow 
 I make war! 
 Cause sin never sleeps 
 It's got me in a trance 
 You can see it in my dreams 
 I make war! 
 Man I beat my flesh 
 To the death 
 Every breath 
 Like I beat my chest 
 I make war 
 Sun up 
 I make war 
 Sun down 
 I make war 
 Time in 
 I make war 
 Time out 
 I make war 
 Against lust 
 Against pride 
 I'm a Christ representer, fin to stand and deliver 
 Cause a lot of my believers struggle with their agenda 
 So I dropped this on an adat 
 Just so you could come play back 
 A hit to be encouraged that rocks you with truth from, way back 
 So listen up to it asap 
 Like you do a lecrae track 
 I'm spittin' written visions to put on heads like a wave cap 
 Sinning, nawl we don't play that 
 Cause that's the way that a slave acts 
 I'm filled with the spirit so tell them dog this is pay back 
 As you begin to copy the carbon copies of Christ 
 And conform to his written image you should be shinning a light 
 If you not, why is that? 
 Is it fear that's been grippin' you 
 Cause you scared they'll be dissin' you 
 Flipping birds while that spit at you 
 If you not, why is that? 
 It don't matter so bump it 
 Perfect love cast out fear and he ain't save us for nothing 
 This is a privilege (privilege) 
 Your life to give to him (give to him) 
 So stand firm for him dawg and let's get it in 
 I make war! 
 Cause sin never sleeps 
 It's got me in a trance 
 You can see it in my dreams 
 I make war! 
 Man I beat my flesh 
 To the death 
 Every breath 
 Like I beat my chest 
 I make war 
 Sun up 
 I make war 
 Sun down 
 I make war 
 Time in 
 I make war 
 Time out 
 I make war 
 Against lust 
 Against pride
