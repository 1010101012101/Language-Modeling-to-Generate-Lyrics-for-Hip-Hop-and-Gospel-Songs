(Pop a Dom boo, what, see'mon) 
 (Petey Pablo) 
 It's the dippy dippy don now you heard that 
 Let's take you back, where the original Tim the bird at? 
 I got shit here to make you down on twelve-pack 
 Call Rudy, tell him hook us up a twenty sack 
 See'mon see'mon see'mon, we ballin why'all 
 Where my cats think you feel me at? 
 Alla why'all, and when we earn that 
 They finally let the dish and the pan 
 Then I start with some cash 
 Let me get to Virginia (V-A) link up with Timbaland 
 Now I'm bustin' they ass 
 Now they callin me The Incredible Man 
 I'ma shit it sick like Yeah 
 And there is one thing to understand 
 Why'all know what it is and Petey is just what I am 
 Spit what I spit 'cause I don't give a damn 
 Spin like just like why'all spin at the mall in blue drawers 
 On some do-rag, it's 'bout to be the all that is 
 New broad, new day, new cars, new motherfuckin deal 
 Hey 
 (Chorus: Petey Pablo) 
 Hey baby bubba 
 If why'all feel it let me hear you say 
 Hey baby bubba 
 We lost the music selector 
 Hey baby bubba 
 If why'all feel it let me hear you say 
 Heyyyeyyyey baby bubba 
 Well he caught me in the van, the gun chat lean fah-ward 
 (Timbaland) 
 Check me out in my black Trans-Am dippin on that man, who that be? 
 TIM-BA-land, now haters want to get at me 
 Just because we three brothers dippin in the FLY RIDE 
 He don't care though, nigga we just three FLY GUYS 
 All up in your local mall pickin' all your local broads 
 HOLLA - if you want to get into a local brawl 
 We the in-timidators, why'all in-timidated 
 By our bling bling ring ring, and I can't debate it 
 LOWRIDERS (bzz bzzt) hittin on switches 
 As we PASS BY YA (bzz bzzt) in sun fire - see'mon! 
 What why'all need to do is throw that shit up, shit up 
 For the cool amigos with Tequila in the gut 
 What why'all know about them Southern girls with them big butts? 
 What why'all know about them buckshots bustin' from a truck? 
 Yeah, yeah - that's that Southern hospitality 
 The come of the me, the come of the Pete 
 The come of the 'goo, the come of the G 
 (Magoo) 
 Mag spit it till I die fucker 
 You wit your label kissin' ass like a damn sucker 
 Meanwhile, Mag in Virginia in some house shoes, watchin the news 
 Do my album when I'm ready, tell my label to sue 
 If I got it I'ma get 'em, it's cornered and sell some (?) 
 From N-why to floater while I'm humpin your daughter 
 Stayin in the French quarter and listen to Juvenile 
 I like that South shit, all my niggaz is wild 
 You gotta come up with a new plan, I'm sayin' man 
 South boys ain't fuckin' playin' - check them 
 This week got OutKast and No Limit, and Eightball 
 Scarface, Ludacris, and Goodie Mob, UHH 
 We do it country 'cause we proud of this shit 
 All those that want to hate on hip-hop can eat a dick 
 I ain't a thug and I ain't tryna be 
 They tryna take my love man and it bothered me
