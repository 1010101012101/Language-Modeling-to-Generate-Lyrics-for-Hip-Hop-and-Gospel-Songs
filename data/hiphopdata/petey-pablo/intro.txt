My Mamma said seem like yesterday when my brother he was gonna leave here 
 Say he was gonna go and make something of heself 
 See my brother wants just to be a rapper 
 And he could rap real good too, 
 He used to have this book he used to carry around with him all the time 
 He used to calle it a diary, he used to take it everywhere he went 
 One day he took it to church when we went to Sunday school 
 And the pastor asked him what's that you got in your hands 
 He said this is my diary 
 And the pastor told him that sinners couldn't have no diarys 
 My brother said he was lying, and my brother said if he couldn't have a diary 
 'Cause he was a sinner, he would just call it a diary of a sinner 
 My mamma told him don't worry about what pastor said, my mamma told him don't 
 Worry about what nobody said 
 If that was your diary, that's gonna be your diary 
 That's what my mamma said 
 He said he gonna turn it into an album, and I believe him too 
 I'm just waitin' One day. One day we gonna turn on the radio...
