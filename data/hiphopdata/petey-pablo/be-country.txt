I'm gonna be country till the day I die 
 Just because I got this and that 
 And moved out from the projects 
 Don't mean I forgot 
 I'm gonna be country till the day I die 
 To the deep and depth of my soul 
 From the top of my head 
 Down to my air forceones 
 Till the day I die 
 Just because I got this and that 
 And moved out from the projects 
 Don't mean I forgot

 From the top of my head 
 Down to my air forceones 
 Till the day I die

 And moved out from the projects 
 Don't mean I forgot

 Taking me on the road with you 
 Showing me the finer things in life 
 Thank-you
