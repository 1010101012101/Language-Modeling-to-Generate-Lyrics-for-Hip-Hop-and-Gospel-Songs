Petey here 
 I wanna tell I'm dead broke and I'm bout to go crazy 
 Half a tank of gas, two ciggaretts 
 Scrapping up change in the ashtray 
 Then the voices its only a test of my faith 
 It was only 
 Damn there's a song for that nigga down south 
 That I was tellin' y'all about yo check this nigga shit out 
 Memba that song I told you came on sounding like 
 He was talking about everything in my life 
 How he was at a point in his own 
 And the problem seemed to be taking a toll 
 He been fightin so long 
 Seemed like everything he did went wrong 
 But he found the strenghth to keep on going 
 And wrote songs about it later on 
 I know this shit hit me home 
 Especially when he was talikin about the money he owed 
 How he took the bills and paid a little somethin' on each one 
 Like he'd put somethin' on his light bill, somethin' on his phone 
 He'd get lil money in here he paid a lil more 
 He ain't have it all so he just paid what he could on it 
 And somehow he managed to keep all this stuff going 
 It was nothin' but a grace to the lord 
 Carolina I remember an I was 
 Dead broke and bout to go crazy 
 Half a tank of gas, two ciggaretts 
 Scrapping up change in the ashtray 
 And the voices its was only a test of my faith 
 It was only 
 Say it seemed like every time he got himself off the ground 
 Somethin' would come and knock him right back down 
 Sometimed he wanted to lay on out for the count 
 Frustrated and tired but he got up anyhow 
 And with a smile I'm talking about 
 It makes ya ask yourself how he could then he broke down and said 
 I ain't never been this happy in my life, ain't got a dime more than I had 
 But everything seems all right, then they said he went low 
 Having a joy of a piece of mind, meant more than any problem I had 
 At a time, and now I know and I'm so glad 
 It was only a sign of the time 
 It was only asking me why should I cry 
 It was only saying be glad your alive today 
 It was only (only) a test of my faith 
 Man he went and sang that song 
 Play this shit every morning just to get my little day goin' 
 You just don't know how this had touched my soul 
 To find out I wasn't the only one that been through so 
 Allmost that exact same something it eased me up 
 Knew what it was just couldn't put iy in words 
 I ain't never been the type that really talk to nobody 
 So all the problem I had I just kept it all inside me 
 Y'all had enough of your own to worry bout 
 Not the little situation I had going on 
 But yano god wont let you suffer to long 
 I ain't even have the radio on I was out on the porch 
 Then boom! from the heavens above 
 Just when I was at that point and I was just about to mess up 
 Man buddah played a song for me 'cause 
 I just shook my head like uh uh uh uh 
 (Chorus to end)
