 When I was apache rappin' in the penetentury yard 
 Eatin ?? outa chanteens, smokin' on roll-ups, strokin on my love meat 
 Waitin for the day cut in the term and free 
 So I could get out here and make mama proud of me 
 And do the right thing run up on the right man 
 That can pull the right string get to where I'm possed to be 
 Had to get ejected cause the game a cold 
 Anywhere and when the motherfucka slammed the door 
 Oh no, hell naw (say what!?) 
 Get lost (Hold up) 
 Wait a minute dog (Sorry Charlie) 
 Fucked around one night went out in New York

 Gave me somethin' spossed to take the pressure off 
 Instead he teach me how to shoot at the mouth (ah)
