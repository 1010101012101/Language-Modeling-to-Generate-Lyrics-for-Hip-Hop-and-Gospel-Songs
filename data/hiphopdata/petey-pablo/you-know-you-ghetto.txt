When ur head is as big as ur pillow 
 When ur cash is a check card in place 
 When you put on panty hose instead of shaving ur legs 
 When you use grease that uve used over and over again 
 When you only go to church on easter and holidays 
 Then you ghetto believe that 
 Course 
 Can you be a rich bitch and be ghetto (yes) 
 Just 'cause ur poor does that mean that you ghetto (no) 
 Some people just don't understand what it means to b ghetto 
 And if you gotta ask then y u never no 
 Being ghetto is just a thing you do sometimes 
 Like hanging ur clothes over the oven to dry 
 And ur late you gotta go and you ain't ready yet 
 Put 'em on anyway and rock 'em half way wet 
 U wear and return everything you buy 
 Always lookin' for a discount till the day you die 
 Got three kids by three different guys 
 Put salt on ur food before you even taste it 
 Get a doggy bag ghetto nig*** ain't wasting s*i* 
 Course 
 No toilet paper somebody used that last you had 
 No problem just get a daily user or paper bag 
 Crumple it up and make it soft for ur @$$ 
 And when you flush the toilet always gets clogged up 
 U no you ghetto ur soap is the size of a chicklet 
 Runnin' to the kitchen wet for dishwasher liquid 
 U waters cold cold 'cause they shut off ur power 
 U no you ghetto if you pee in the shower 
 Course
