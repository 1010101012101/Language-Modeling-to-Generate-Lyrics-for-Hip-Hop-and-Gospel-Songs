One, don't mess with the radio 
 Two, don't tell me which way to go 
 Three, just leave it up to me cause 
 Four, you ridin' with a pro 
 Five, you gotta leave it all behind 
 Six, we bout to get up in the mix now 
 Seven, everyday is a blessing 
 Eight, don't make no mistake about one 
 I'm just riding out trying to figure out 
 What's up, this feeling can't be controlled 
 Trying not to look so fly and it's 3:25 but I'm ready to roll 
 'Cause I've been waiting all week just to find 
 A party just to get out and jam 
 My destination's unclear 
 'Cause I know the party's wherever I am 
 One, don't mess with the radio 
 Two, don't tell me which way to go 
 Three, just leave it up to me cause 
 Four, you ridin' with a pro 
 Five, you gotta leave it all behind 
 Six, we bout to get up in the mix now 
 Seven, everyday is a blessing 
 Eight, don't make no mistake about one 
 Now that the hour is nine, time to check for this dime 
 Breakin' hearts at the door 
 No time for standing in line 
 The beat is playin' in my spine and I can't take it no more 
 Throw your hands up, let's cut this rug up 
 And party like it ain't no thang 
 We can do it all night till the daylight 
 No, it ain't no shame in my game, yeah 
 One, don't mess with the radio 
 Two, don't tell me which way to go 
 Three, just leave it up to me cause 
 Four, you ridin' with a pro 
 Five, you gotta leave it all behind 
 Six, we bout to get up in the mix now 
 Seven, everyday is a blessing 
 Eight, don't make no mistake about one
