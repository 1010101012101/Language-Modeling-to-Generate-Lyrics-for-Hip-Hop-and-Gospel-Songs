Do what I do, niggas be asking for too much 
 Used to play them, now they choose up 
 Middle fingers, I got two of them 
 Truthsayer, I'm the truest 
 Make them bitches say they blew it 
 Fuck these niggas and they two cents 
 Take my baby out to Ruth's Chris 
 You said I wouldn't be shit 
 You said I wouldn't be this 
 There's some shit I probably shouldn't say 
 Trap money that I put away 
 Don't you hit me for the discount 
 Shut the fuck up, I'm counting 
 All these niggas want is days now 
 I been out here moving mountains 
 Do what I do, niggas be asking for too much 
 Used to play them, now they choose up 
 Middle fingers, I got two up 
 Bitches been happening, yo 
 Bitches been happening, yo 
 Bitches been happening, yo 
 Bitches been happening, yo 
 Fuck niggas gotta merge 
 Hit these bitches with the curve 
 All these bitches say they love me 
 Tell them it'll never work 
 Bitches been happening, yo 
 Bitches been happening, yo 
 Bitches been happening, yo 
 Bitches been happening, yo 
 Broke boy get money now 
 Grey days turn sunny now 
 Skinny nigga got a tummy now 
 Money, money, money now 
 Bitches been happening, yo 
 Bitches been happening, yo 
 Bitches been happening, yo 
 Bitches been happening, yo
