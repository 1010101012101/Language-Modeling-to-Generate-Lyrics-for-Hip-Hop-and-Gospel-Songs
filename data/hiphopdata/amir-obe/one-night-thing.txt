Won't find love in the hills 
 Won't find love in the valley 
 Had a one night thing 
 Found love parked up in an alley 
 One night, one night thing 
 I had a one night thing, one night thing 
 Had a one night thing with a girl from Calabasas 
 Had a one night thing with a girl from Calabasas 
 I had a one night thing, one night thing 
 I had a one night thing, one night thing 
 Still hitting hits though, weed up on an off day 
 Got you feeling like the plug now, that's what they all say 
 I ain't never needed dough, got the backboard all to myself 
 Hit you niggas with a windmill, fuck the Jaguar, I got the belt 
 I'm way up, waved up, took another addy, just stayed up 
 Don't listen to anything they say though 
 Tell me all them stories that you made up 
 Pretty women singing trash songs 
 Put these bitches in my sad songs 
 Yeah, I knew it wouldn't last long, never last long, no, no, no 
 Won't find love in the hills 
 Won't find love in the valley 
 Had a one night thing 
 Found love parked up in an alley 
 One night, one night thing 
 I had a one night thing, one night thing 
 Had a one night thing with a girl from Calabasas 
 Had a one night thing with a girl from Calabasas 
 I had a one night thing, one night thing 
 I had a one night thing, one night thing 
 Rich girl, ratchet, that's the new way 
 Caught you slipping in the mix for like two days 
 Rich girl, ratchet, that's the new way 
 Caught you slipping in the mix for like two days 
 Bout to hit you with the fashion 
 (?) Faith 
 If you ain't know then it's you're bad 
 Bad bitches only can taste it 
 Take your time, take your time 
 These niggas still think when we together 
 No chance, I'll erase your mind 
 You looking salty, you sending texts 
 You like, boy, why didn't you call me? 
 Take it away, take it away, man at this stage 
 (Talk your shit, talk your shit, oh) 
 She don't wanna waste no time 
 She just wanna waste my time 
 Won't find love in the hills 
 Won't find love in the valley 
 Had a one night thing 
 Found love parked up in an alley 
 One night, one night thing 
 I had a one night thing, one night thing 
 Had a one night thing with a girl from Calabasas 
 Had a one night thing with a girl from Calabasas 
 I had a one night thing, one night thing 
 I had a one night thing, one night thing
