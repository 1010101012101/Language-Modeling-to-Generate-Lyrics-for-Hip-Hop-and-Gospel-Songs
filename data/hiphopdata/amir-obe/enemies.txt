Baby you a beautiful stress 
 I don't got a cigarette yes 
 I just got a match and a fuse 
 Burnin' out, I'ma use it on you 
 I could really use a distraction 
 I been really used to you askin' 
 I could really use a real one 
 I feel for you, you ain't never feel enough 
 Young Love, we pretend we not numb 
 Molly in the Smart Water 'til we go dumb 
 If it's feelin' low I'm gonna say this 
 Never really mean it when we say we both done, no 
 Real you when you show up 
 Real me and you grow up 
 Ain't no real love, ain't no real love 
 Ain't no real love, ain't no real love 
 It's okay, it's okay now 
 But we don't know [?], I feel the same now 
 [?], it's okay now 
 It's okay, it's okay now 
 But we don't know [?], I feel the same now 
 [?], it's okay now 
 Yeah, I take the blame for the come up 
 I take the blame for the drama 
 I take the blame for the jealousy 
 I take the blame for your enemies 
 Yeah, I take the blame for the pain love 
 I take the blame it ain't the same love 
 I take the blame for the jealousy 
 I take the blame for your enemies 
 Yeah-eaaah 
 I don't even know what to say 
 Pull up to the crib with some Roses 
 Make-up still running down ur face 
 Cause you were still dealin' with emotions 
 My good intentions go to waste 
 Gettin' caught up where the hoes is 
 Yo whatever happened to the flame? 
 'Cause me and you was looking like the closest, yeah yeah
