Salutes 2 action be tha latest enter-ree 4 illadel colonies da get da 
 Cream like cherry jubalee - my steeze put cha at ease like 
 Methamphetamines or like Tony Shakks "fan-na-cees" about his wallabess 
 Slice fit-een yo meen Big East be comin' through ghetto magic plusa da 
 Bullies back it what me now Buddha Blessed 4 I and I provide da 
 Greatest Natur-role pure as life that exit from Nah gent-ta-tillc 
 Styles interna-sha-nile likde direct connects to internet verbal text 
 Blossum like chia pets per-fect wit da mic devices Bahama-dee be tha' 
 Nices bringin' nix rap thing 2 the light like osyrus - 4 tha' 9 pound 
 Ex-ced-da-ra-saaloom 2 GangStarr and my nigga K-Sarrah 
 Second verse 
 Ha yo, I'm doing this for the cruuz claimin' that there better I'm 
 Tickled, ya must be like Sanford on the ripple little by little, I 
 Kick verses from the middle of my brain, the Riddler couldn't fuck wit 
 Kannon Riddles I remain the undisputed you should of known if you knew 
 It, Montell couldn't tell you how we do it and few get the chance to 
 Even so the Kannon Dance wit da Kannon Band shit be slammin' more than 
 Larry Nance and plus it's in me to give you more like Demi, I do easy 
 Leave aardway to penny, as I display skillz for what it's worth sent 
 To this earth to stop the curse of wake lic's upon my turf, this is 
 The end like Armagedin your settin a bad example niggaz still using my 
 Samples times ample ha yo swyft never said she was the baddest but I 
 Kept it real, you niggaz frontin talkin' 'bout you packin steel your 
 Sportin a first all up in rectum by the central kid's sitting all up 
 In the bullie section 
 Third verse 
 Do you remember those you chase to forget back when ya ears was wet 
 And now ya preachin' ya releasin' mini-tec I need a mic check because 
 Da static come sparatic emcee's be hooked like addicts while 
 Casualties stay tragic there ain't no glamour in that story all guts 
 No glory entrenced in jealousy just like the suckers who abhor me they 
 Tell but they don't know the core, so raw is now my reference like 
 Mumia there is no evidence to say that I'm more tha I am undbending 
 Neve revending similar to million men me say "Just-us" you say me bust 
 Bust mental stagnation like the cancer patients eatin' cow fuss as the 
 Minds rust from dawn to dusk I rest in Mecca the words sound power as 
 In energy see Heka to die because ya black simply be no cause at all 
 Surreality just like the lengends of the fall initial looks of the 
 Shook hearted kids who shouldn't started lyrics leave like spirits and 
 And the waters Moses parted Do or Die's ya slogan but niggaz slip with 
 Trojans major mental corrosion like Murray's meat unfrozen I am the 
 Chosen Earth Sun Moon and Stars hard for me to find a top contender 
 Just to spar some peep the exterior and believe inferior next ya know 
 They callin for a sound bwoy burial D&D Studio be wicked catch wreck 
 For infinity one love peace to Bahamadia 
 Last verse 
 Like Salt and Pepa, I take it to the next platoe niggaz scream nay what 
 Dis Brown Sugar like D'Angelo I make it better fo' fantanics fienin 
 For da Buttaz Boo like 25 to lifers do from lack of gettin' douce 
 You-oou, I put my little thing in action smoother, than sat-tin or 
 Special Ed when he was taxin' headz relax and play tha' back when I 
 Spill I regulate a flow like chicks on birth control pills-ill anitics 
 Keep it movin' on bouncin' like nylon from illadel 2 Lebanon - (no doubt)
