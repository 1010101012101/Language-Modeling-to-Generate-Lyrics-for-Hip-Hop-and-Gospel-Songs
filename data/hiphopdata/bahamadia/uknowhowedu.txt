When they pumpin' in the jeeps, it's gonna rock right - true 
 In the streets it's gonna rock right - true 
 At the shows it's gonna rock right - true 
 When we go wit the butters boo you know how we do 
 Landscapin' and mentally shapin' 
 Lookin' at my gucci it's about that time 
 Represent my peoples on the ill-a-del side 
 Live like my 93 shit funk vibe 
 I used imagination like hansoul 
 Master like vic with the off beat flow 
 A lady like b in ster-re-erie-o 
 Raps way back at the plat wit super bad disco 
 Use to do the freak the patty duke and giggalo 
 Aftermidnights on the weekend (ho) 
 You remember we 3d with steady b 
 Nuff respect go to yvette money 
 Psk miz on pause delay 
 MC jewel t rocked ride the cross fade 
 Breeze from nah bottom discombobbaboobalate, 
 Cerrone was da break if you was diggin' in da crates 
 Da youngstas be makin' crews pop 
 Divine beings got da true sound of hip-hop 
 Man called lux flipped on da boom box mad props 
 To ruggedness lyrical terrorists 
 Funky rhymin' like E-B-S 
 Nation with dem nigs Snooze B and Jazz Fresh 
 Easin' back and let it hit cha rumbletown mixture 
 Its merdah wit da hypnotic rude girl 
 Back to back ghetto pun tha scratch 
 Battle star galack cosmic abstraxx 
 Da first out da limo was that nigga Charlie Mack 
 West phils represent K-D where's it at 
 'Cause we not takin' no shorts more 
 Yuup - yuup to tha rebels to pan and dice raw... 
 (Shout outs and rock - rock ons)
