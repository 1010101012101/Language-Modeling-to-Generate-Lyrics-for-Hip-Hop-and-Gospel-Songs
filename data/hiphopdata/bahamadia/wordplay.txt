Peep my credentials involving instrumentals 
 Rhymes massage the cells in the mental 
 Relieves you of the babblin' that you was used to 
 Every since the departing days of the juice crew 
 My style been milk like a bottle of YooHoo 
 Was neva MC monkey see monkey do 
 I move through baby real natural 
 Pose for "illadel" when I gets lyrical 
 Ou-ou like Cool Cee use to do 
 I make the kids wanna Rah like Afu 
 Shouts to Mecca cause the planets mad digable 
 Allow me to pause and hit the Mork nanu - nanu... 
 Wordplay 
 My aura is psychedelic flow non-prehistoric 
 Metamorphic boric like acid no hat tricks a classic 
 So park that ass like Jurassic and check the matrix 
 Completed like 7 (seven) to overshadow the triple 6 (six) 
 Complimenting zig-a-zicks 
 With wisdom like the 5 percenters when doing mathematics 
 Flips scripts like acrobatics intrinsic in rapping 
 Like insulin to diabetics text is didactic 
 With nutrience like muslix on wax 
 Flex facts like hydraulics when vexed 
 To catch flicks by Miramax or Kodak 
 I looks beyond the door like 100x 
 For Wordplay... 
 Breaks out analogies like pollen do allergies 
 Got the vocab like the Fugees to collect gees 
 Top Bill like Bellamy shocking hardcore headz like electricity 
 Cuts come complimentary of disc jockey Sean-Ski 
 Yo vocally BAHAMA-D be easy like Moe-Bee 
 Raps react radio act like DJ Ran and Colby 
 To the Roots like Malik B. 
 Flows pose as noise reduction on MCs like dolby 
 Down by law like felonies catchy like T-B 
 Essential to the Elements like Ceceley 
 With Wordplay ...
