Roll out the fabric carpet 
 So I can walk 
 Hook up those microphones 
 So I can talk 
 Could be the mayor of the city 
 And clean up all of this mess 
 I'd never be assassinated 
 In my bullet proof vest 
 You can't keep a good girl down 
 No you can't keep a girl down 
 I've been lost and found 
 No you can't keep a good girl down 
 You can't keep a good girl down 
 No you can't keep a girl down 
 I've been lost and I've been found 
 You can't keep a good girl down 
 I'm takin' the corners 
 Drivin' on two wheels 
 I'm climbin' the cliff tops while you're 
 Grabbin' my heels 
 You can't keep a good girl down 
 No you can't keep a good girl down 
 I've been lost and found 
 No you can't keep a good girl down 
 A round house kick 
 Would leave you dead 
 And I'll take the biggest jug and 
 Smash it over your head 
 You can't keep a good girl down 
 No you can't keep a good girl down 
 I've been lost and found 
 No you can't keep a good girl down 
 You can't keep a good girl down 
 No you can't keep a good girl down 
 I've been lost and I've been found 
 You can't keep a good girl down
