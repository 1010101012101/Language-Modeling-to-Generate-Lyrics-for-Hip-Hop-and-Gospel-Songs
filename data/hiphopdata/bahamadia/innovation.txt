(First verse) 
 Flam, combustion thrustin' new versions of verses over kids heads like 
 Halos bendin' ney brain cells like indo "n-o-va-shun' definition 
 Different renditions of creations sorta like what I'm doin', style 
 That I'm usin' - wordsmith meets rap fusion if that's a category fit 
 For grammy like Source Awards then com-pet-tit-tors bet-tor look out 
 Like Pack Jam once I record - "n-o-v-a-shun" the first, to influx 
 Information no relation to wackness instead pedantic - combating prose 
 With passionate passages surpassing the realm of gun to-ting savages 
 However able da serve them like Mr. Belvedere once confronted, they 
 Don't ever want it 'cause I got my Freestyle Fellowship membership but I 
 Will still get fit to, Ace-ya-alone - (I)"nn-o-va-shun"... 
 (Second verse) 
 Presentation "ori-gi-nile" - ways of thinking "ra-shun-nile" ready for 
 Consumption to each one suckered in or rather lured by each lyric 
 Contoured to thee com-plexity of "n-o-va-shun" I,"nn-o-v-a-shun" 
 Bi-coastal vernacular enables one to become, a-phenomenon - a - 
 "Sen-sa-shun" ac-com-pa-nee-ing pa-rump-pa-pum-pums - "n-o-vashun"... 
 (Third verse) 
 Finer degrees or shall I say meters of rap and poetry combine to make 
 This one topic of discussion, you heard dat shit "n-o-va-shun" 
 Bahamadia must be one of tha last pioneers in captivity, linking vocal 
 Tones and microphones to holy matrimony, each song composed in ritual 
 Ceremonies - for sight exceeds that of modern day prophet Rambonie, 
 (I) Nn-o-va-shu-n-o-va-shu, I-"nn-o-va- (pause) shun".
