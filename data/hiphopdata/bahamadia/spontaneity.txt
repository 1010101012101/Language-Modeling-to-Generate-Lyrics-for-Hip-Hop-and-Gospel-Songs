Straight outta the metro rhythm central I'm innovative at thee intro 
 'Cause I go slow moe but never slow poke but never joke dope but never 
 Coke spits a riddle like flim loose with my lyrics like double jointed 
 Limbs I twist and I bend common episodes past freak mode the monstrous 
 Bass beneath my pace be like morse code slash beep slash beep scanners 
 Zero in to the system in your jeep I'm out there with Kool Keith and 
 Ced-Gee and De La inventors of my third seeing eye with futuristic 
 Vision I'm not among loony nut cakes on a mission I gets in where I 
 Fit in cause life's too short so you could all label me weirdo but yo 
 I know it's talent ... 
 (Chorus) Mad explosive spontaneity 
 At present I speak the new beginning when every other trend fell short 
 So who'll be the shareholder of my kinda thoughts besides the studious 
 'Cause the gludious max-a-must lack ability to scoop all capabilities of 
 Spontaneity within me depicted kicked it true vibes pops jazz but 
 Collaborated with the cool known flows but unfamiliar grooves soothe 
 Individual moods like soul food for thought ... 
 Rip here be dizz like everybody's on it cause eternal verbal expansion 
 Keeps enhancing brain child's ability to like surpass a swarm of booty 
 Ass no grass roots having ass MC's with luke warm degrees trying to 
 Get hot like sun rays but save your jazz for Sun Ra you don't wanna 
 Spar my skills fill up thee outer limits like mars and you's a little 
 Star I jacked your twinkle when I excelled well like Tinkerbell up to 
 Higher levels and heights cerebral flow takes flight on airborne time 
 I'm a prime candidate of specimen in your walkman as you're listening 
 I make things happen 'cause I'm the captain keepin' this great ... 
 (Chorus) Mad explosive spontaneity (repeat)
