Irasshaimase 
 Kyo no special wa 
 Kujira dazo 
 Yum 
 So daro 
 Hoshii daro 
 Kono kasu yaro 
 That whale though 
 Yo 
 Now what's better than the feeling of gutting the wild beast 
 Beneath the earth's sheets with the taste of mild beef 
 Cuisine with the rice and soy 
 Oh boy want to come up to the ocean run the deep with the boys now 
 Whales, dolphins, narwhals, krills 
 The Jap's got a special set of skills that involves killing 
 We ain't chilling till we distribute the mercury 
 Got MSG and it's eating till it's hurting me yum 
 That's food to die for 
 That food to kill for 
 This food to divide laws 
 I ain't saying shit 
 You got it for science 
 Take a couple organs 
 Give the rest to the markets 
 Hah, now that harmless 
 Except for the whale 
 It's got a harness 
 If the skins a little thicker than the rest of them 
 You can bet that America's gonna bless them 
 Try to caress them 
 So they can be the best men clearly 
 The way of our quotation specimens 
 Despite spilling the oil like it was estrogen 
 Despite killing the millions of middle eastern men 
 Despite the decency to save another human being 
 Waste time saving creatures from the sea
