Fried rice, fri-fri-fried rice bitch 
 You wanna play your cards with God and roll the dice bitch 
 Weeding out the weak with agriculture educational 
 Got me eating seeds and I ain't talking bout fellatio 
 I'm crazy yo, got that technique stir fry chopstick Asian flow 
 I ain't about the oven or the microwave grills 
 But I know a little bit about the culinary skills 
 Required 
 If you wanna roll with the frying pan 
 Gotta fry with the heart of a china man 
 Anybody got another method in the pantry can suck my dick 
 This shit tastes like vagina man 
 Now I ain't no Gordon Ramsay 
 But I make the best damn rice you pansies 
 A bitch like me came from Japan see 
 Coin slot eyes gonna drop the panties 
 So if you want a piece of this get in line you piece of shit 
 They just keep coming back for more you'd think Jehovah's witnesses 
 They call me the grain man 
 Ancient ritual praying can 
 Help cook rice on a spiritual level for those willing and able to be the king of the table 
 Huh 
 Have some of my grain and I ain't talking about the fucking headaches 
 You get on the morning after Fridays 
 I throw this rice like bridesmaids 
 Stir fry

 Stir fry 
 Stir fry 
 Stir fry 
 Stir fry 
 Stir fry
