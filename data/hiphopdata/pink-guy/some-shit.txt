(Yeah... Feelin' classy today. Well, aight. Let's go.) 
 I'm not even one to psycho 
 I'm so afraid that everybody looks at my lyrics 
 There's a lot o typo 
 (Yeah) 
 Money rate growing in my pocket is the minimal 
 Running from the mobs of people 
 Treat me like a criminal 
 The pinnacle of raw entertainment, my basement 
 Throwing rocks at main events 
 I ain't revel the havoc 
 And take it easy in the hammock 
 Al Qaeda is the testimony 
 Don't you ever rectify 
 The killable syllables 
 In the pinnacle of emphasis 
 I'm a creepy little rapper 
 Coming out the factory, capture me 
 I will be the toughest rapper, actually 
 Watch me as I drag my ass to the top gradually 
 (Ugh) 
 I never sleep 
 I stay away and prey on the weak 
 Then I devour the freaks 
 And then I pray for the weak 
 I transmit gamma rays 
 And break off the manta ray's tail 
 Raise hell on a Saturday 
 And stabbin' people 
 Yeah 
 Another rapper washin' the dishes 
 Don't look at me and my sick compositions 
 (Oh sick) 
 I am done with this feelin' 
 I am done with this feelin' 
 All you suckers this evenin' 
 All you suckers this evenin' 
 Are goin' down... 
 (Whoo)
