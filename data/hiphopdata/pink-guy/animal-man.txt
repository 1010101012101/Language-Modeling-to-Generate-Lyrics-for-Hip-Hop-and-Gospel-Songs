I love animals, especially when they're dead 
 So get it embedded up in your head 'cause I'm headed to the red cross 
 I'm snapping dogs necks like it's a hobby of mine 
 'Cause I'm rapping like a turban when I'm snapping this cats spine 
 I love hitting deer and making these hounds fight 
 To you they may be screaming, but to me it just sounds like 
 If PETA begs me to stop 
 Like my cock was lodged down in their sensitive spot 
 And I rocked these polka dot furs from dogs that I killed 
 Along with ten other dogs, Green Peace ain't thrilled 
 'Cause on my way to work 
 I try to hit as many squirrels and deer as I can 
 Endangered species are like harder targets 
 They greet me by my first name in the black markets 
 With fresh carcass, shredding like guitar picks 
 Yeah, I'm known for killing raccoons, and baboons, and kangaroos 
 For a thousand smacaroons 
 And the Chinese butcher 
 Cook it well with more Ash than Kutcher 
 If you find your dead pet in the yard you can bet it's me Mr. Poultry 
 Chopping down the tall trees 
 Feed it pellets, I ain't talking about the Pedigree 
 Ha, you just made an enemy 
 Here try giraffe, it's cooked and tastes heavenly 
 The only good animal is the live stock 
 So sit back with me and watch these three lions rot 
 Killing animals is great, fuck the rules 
 If you're scared of the wild just grab the right tools 
 Shoot the fucking birds out of the sky and they're singing 
 We fall again, we fall again 
 (Grab your weapons bitch) 
 We fall again 
 We fall again 
 Uh, just watch them fall, uuh 
 I got these birds screaming like angels 
 When they fall out the sky they looking mad grateful 
 Grab your shotguns and grab your rifles 
 Have these birds looking sleepy like NyQuil 
 We fall again, we fall again 
 We fall again 
 We fall again 
 (Slow down) 
 We fall again, we fall again 
 We fall again 
 We fall again 
 When you turn around 
 I lose vision 
 Got me running deep into superstition 
 And I 
 Can't believe my fucking eyes 
 In a thousand years I'd never thought I'd see you come from beneath me 
 I feel like falling 
 I feel like falling 
 We fall again, we fall again 
 We fall again 
 We fall again, uh 
 When you turn around 
 I lose vision (We) 
 Got me running deep 
 Fall again, we fall again 
 We fall again 
 We fall again 
 You do realize this is a song about killing animals 
 Oh, let him rap about what he wants, he's just a boy
