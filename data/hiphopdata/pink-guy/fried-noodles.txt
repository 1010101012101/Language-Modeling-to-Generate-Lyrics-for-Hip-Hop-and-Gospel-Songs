Pussy, pussy, pussy 
 Can't you see 
 You bitches can't do it like me 
 Motherfuckers stay mad 
 Like I killed the mom or something 
 If you really didn't care 
 You'd let it be 
 I've been dying since day one 
 But y'all knew that 
 My dick is like Americans 
 Too fat, but dangerous 
 I'm the grimiest motherfucker to walk this earth 
 The shit I do is way below dirty sewers, a connoisseur 
 I'm a flying reptile 
 A pterodactyl on Adderall 
 I've got a bunch of scales that I dug up 
 You've never heard at all 
 Eat a dick little faggot, jeez 
 And furthermore 
 You trying to scrap with me 
 I don't beef, faggot 
 I'm herbivore 
 Hmm 
 I crawled into the industry 
 A saturated circus 
 Manipulating like Hillary 
 They say I'm crazy 
 But lately they've been defending me 
 Because take a look around, motherfucker 
 Everyone's digging me 
 I live in a constant state of fear and misery 
 Do you miss me anymore? 
 And I don't even notice 
 When it hurts anymore 
 Anymore 
 Anymore 
 Anymore 
 Pussy, pussy, pussy 
 Can't you read 
 I'm a dirty old pussy eating freak 
 Motherfuckers still mad 
 Like I killed the mom or something 
 If you really didn't care 
 You'd let me eat 
 Here we go again 
 I'll make jokes about your estrogen 
 That's pretty much the rest of this song 
 I'm roasting everything 
 I'm a weird little entity 
 That'll enter titties 
 And bust all over the tummy and little nippies 
 (Ew!) 
 I know I'm morbid at times 
 That's how I like to be 
 They call my dick a mammoth 
 You're salty you got a micro-d 
 Classic penis joke 
 Inserted with appropriate timing 
 Because if I ain't got a penis line 
 I ain't dining 
 No homo, but seriously I'm getting faded 
 And my life is like my vids 
 Low budget and underrated 
 Kids, the only way to succeed 
 Is to chip away at the soul 
 And hope by the time you get there 
 You ain't singin' 
 I live in a constant state of fear and misery 
 Do you miss me anymore? 
 And I don't even notice 
 When it hurts anymore 
 Anymore 
 Anymore 
 Anymore 
 Don't take the lyrics too seriously, I really don't give a shit
