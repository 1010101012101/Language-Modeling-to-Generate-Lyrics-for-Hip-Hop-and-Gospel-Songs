Let the beat drop like old people with polio 
 (That's actually really fucked up) 
 Bitches can't handle my shit 
 They get really excited when they see my dick 
 My dick pays rent, and my dick pays quick 
 So I got a little story that'll rattle your tits 
 Why wasn't the chicken able to cross the road? 
 Because it was disabled 
 The doctors say I have a disease 
 But I find that really fucking hard to believe 
 I hang dogs from trees so I can raise the roof 
 I turned around way too fast and knocked things off the shelf with my dick 
 Now it's really red and blue like lilo and stitch 
 Now it's really starting to itch, hepatitis 
 This beat drops like my balls at the age of twelve 
 My nipple shrivels up like a dehydrated elf 
 I shot an old man in the kneecaps 
 They call me moose knuckles 
 Because when I sit down, you can see my balls stick out like moose knuckles 
 I get diseases from the great sex 
 I'm coughing up blood so I'm gonna pass the mic 
 Bitches can't handle my shit 
 They get really excited when they see my dick 
 My dick pays rent, and my dick pays quick 
 So I got a little story that'll rattle your tits 
 They call me Mr. Fancy Pants, with these nasty rants 
 They wanna get a little Mr. Magic Man 
 They want a little fire from the land Japan 
 So I give a little hell for these faggots man 
 I shake things up like Parkinson's on these faggots with cars and rims 
 'Cause we're having a blast 
 Like Kim Jung on his last lung bombing America son, yeah 
 You can't kill me, 'cause Chin Chin is my lord 
 Fuck that I ain't about the peace 
 I'm really all about that vaginal crease 
 'Cause I'm done with you assholes 
 You fail hard like you're missin' a class though 
 Mother fucker I will kill you 
 Mother fucker I will kill you
