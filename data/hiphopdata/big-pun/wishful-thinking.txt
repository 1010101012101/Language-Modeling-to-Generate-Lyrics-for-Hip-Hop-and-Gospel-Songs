[Fat Joe] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable 
 [Kool G Rap] Once you rule the world every girl will want to be with you 
 [Big Pun] First I get the money then I get the power 
 [B-Real] B-Real of the hill eliminate the guitars 
 (Verse 1: B-Real) 
 Thinkin' of takin' a plane 
 To take a flight out to the red light 
 And smuggle 10 pounds of weed 
 Make it home tonight 
 Be the number 1 smuggler in the area 
 Got enough weed to fill up and air craft carrier 
 Erb slanger, Hasila Incorporated 
 State to state and over seas gettin' faded 
 Buddha king had seen the green proton 
 I'm bringing it on right back home to Don 
 Many different strains of erb in my brain 
 I'm slippin' through customs in my hydro plane 
 Skunk and the one chocolate ty bud 
 Niggaz let's get high in the sky hit the blunts 
 And the bongs, fill up the lungs, niggaz don't stop 
 Fools get sprung when they get there smoked up for crops 
 Like gettin' props, where all the soldiers in the board 
 Yo what would you do if the world was yours. 
 [Kool G Rap] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable 
 [Big Pun] Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you 
 [B-Real] First I get the money then I get the power 
 [Fat Joe] Joey crack twist the caps enemys I devour 
 (Verse 2: Fat Joe) 
 Yo it's only a dream 16 battin' Beamers and Benz's 
 Lying penance with diamonds ill as lacin' in a face with avengances 
 Having blocks on in the lava parts dome 
 My mankind with crime is how you shine if you can't rhyme 
 Dime droppers will give ya fad time if you sleep 
 But momma single be mastera heater on city streets 
 In the east I be known as Don Cartegena 
 Claimin' the (?) like (?) 
 Lacin' the china wit Menida 
 To seller need repeater or be a leader 
 Like a preacher or presume a steeper 
 Peep the shit that I be on, sippin' Don 
 Until I'm drunk with a million in my trunk like Nikki Vons 
 Come on I be the top extortionist 
 Adopt adopted foster kids right out the muthafuckin' orphanage 
 Yeah, I do it for the youth, I'm livin' proof 
 All my peeps in the streets know I speak the truth. 
 [Big Pun] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable 
 [B-Real] Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you 
 [Fat Joe] First ya get the money then you get the power 
 [Kool G Rap] G Rap bustin' the gats slangin' last by every hour 
 (Verse 3: Kool G Rap) 
 No doubt, 
 I be the crime story of all ghetto territorys 
 Soldiers at war be blowin' up niggaz like glory 
 With pharmasoticle lavatorys 
 Major to chemistry, PHD in streetology 
 Degree in drug industry 
 Combinin' H²O with matter from crack batter 
 Rest it through molecules scatter 
 Launchin' rockets to make the pocket fatter 
 Mind bitin' an arm starts a crime 
 G equals and MC dat ain't near the square son I gets mine 
 But yo the kill the fill with force fields and shields 
 And holy steel, a nigga keep it real 
 You know the deal, if the stakes ain't to high for me to grab 
 I got's to have, stack all the cabbage 
 From constructin' a drug traffic 
 Police a jam me in try to find a new pot to frame me in 
 Aramians so I resort the evil thoughts like Damien 
 This flame of fury to the D-A and the jury 
 100 grand the judges hammer slams I'm a free man. 
 [B-Real] What would you do if you could do the unbelievable 
 [Fat Joe] Once you rule the world every girl would want to be with you 
 [Kool G Rap] First ya get the money then you get the power 
 [Big Pun] Big Pun's the same son bustin' my guns for the Dollars 
 (Verse 4: Big Pun) 
 Yo, I'm walkin' waters 
 Spit fire and shit Häagen-Dazs 
 Idolize no man like Conan and stand beside the guards 
 Be larger than life, twice as nice as ya idol 
 Pump you with pride, then guide you str8 to hell like the bible 
 I'm lible to start manipulatin' minds infiltratin' clown 
 'M out the pitfalls of life entice with nickel plated nine 
 It seems every time I'm dream I'm in a nightmare of fiend 
 Livin' a world of mothers and queens and men would fight fare 
 [Fat Joe: Hell Yeah!] I wish I could, I wish I could 
 Never forget this whole damn world ain't shit I'm just a hood 
 Yo I change my life make my wife and get the chance for the pain 
 And physical abuse, give her back her best years 
 Grab my chest hairs, pound my fist on the hard cement 
 Spark the scent, and cloud the sky till my heart's content 
 Repent and vow she be forgiven 
 How could we be proud to live in a world 
 Which condems man, child, to women 
 Child to women.
