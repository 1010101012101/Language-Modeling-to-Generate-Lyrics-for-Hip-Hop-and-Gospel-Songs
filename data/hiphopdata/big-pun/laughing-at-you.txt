(Tony Sunshine) 
 Ha Ha Ha 
 Do you see me now 
 You remember me the guy from the back of the class 
 That used to where the glasses the one you 
 Used to laugh at look at me now brother do you like fruit 
 Well I'm chewin your girls nipples 
 How do you like them apples asshole 
 Chorus: Tony Sunshine 
 IM laughing at you 
 IM laughing at you now you told me I was ugly 
 I was scared to crack a smile 
 Pun: Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha 
 IM Laughing at you now 
 Pun Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha 
 I'm laughing at you 
 (Pun) 
 600 Benz 20 inch rims house on the hill hittin' mad skin 
 Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha 
 It was all a scheme I used to load the teck with the magazine 
 So I was mean but I still had a scheme 
 17 years young everything seemed fun 
 Still considered a veteran 'cause I feared none 
 Pun's from the street where there ain't no rules 
 But carried heat 'cause he ain't no fool 
 Ain't no wrong for dollars in negative digits 
 So debted followers and got rid of the quitters 
 That never forget us 'cause we've been down since the 
 Genesis 200 horse power to 400 Pegasus 
 The messages don't sleep till it's over 
 Next thing you know shorty seven feet 
 Tippin' over I'm still in the water drownin' 
 Knights and murder till the immortal terror squad 
 Threw me a life preserver now I'm ice forever 
 Stomach bustin' out the white carrera 
 Life is better now niggas wanna rhyme together 
 Ay que sera! what can I do but take you to strive 
 Ay que hago! I hope the streets don't take me alive 
 You wasted your life and refused the struggle while 
 I aim for the sky pay dues and bubbles I WIN! 
 (Pun) 
 Now it's not funny 'cause I'm hot and got a pot of money 
 Alot of hunnies around (Don't stop do the brown for me) 
 My every wish is her command call her bitch she understands 
 I reminisce how she used to dis me and my man 
 Check part of the plan she told my son I wasn't the man 
 I ain't gonna to stop till I got a heart in my hand 
 I can silence the lamb but couldn't silence her cause 
 She was as wild as a man with a bottle of liquor 
 I'm not going to hit her I'm gonna debt her tonight 
 Double platinum now she's one in the tribe well in the ride now 
 Well in a fly gettin' high now no more whiteout send the cubans 
 To provide now it's my world I demand my respect 
 Give me your girl or get slapped in your neck 
 Ain't nothin' change I'm still humble and modest 
 And I'm always proud to admit I came straight from the projects 
 Hardy har har har
