Brace yourself, before you get yourself laced 
 Fucking with the sick, Arabic Scarface 
 We represent a cold race, thugs full of hate 
 Enemies of the state, locked, behind gates 
 First nigga to move, get laced like shoes 
 As an example so the second nigga knows what I do 
 Where I'm from, we don't give a fuck about rules; we're grimy 
 Aiight motha fucka, try me 
 I'm one of the worse Scarfaces, reincarnated 
 That carving your name in the pavement, shit is outdated 
 I go to Mount Rushmore with high power lasers 
 Replace all four of them faces, with four facelifts 
 One at a time, till they all look like mine 
 A new and improved design, for the one triple nine 
 A better nigga, with better lyrics and better rhymes 
 Ahead of my time, I'll even put my life on the line 
 While you in the studio, writing your rhyme 
 I'll run up in it, with a hydrogen bomb, singing a sacred psalm 
 And then I'll blow us all to hell, in the name of Allah
