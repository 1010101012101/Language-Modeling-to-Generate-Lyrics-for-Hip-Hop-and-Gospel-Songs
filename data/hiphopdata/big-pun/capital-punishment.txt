(Big Pun) 
 It's mine, it's all mine you understand? Just me and my peoples. Can you dig 
 That? 21st century, but I never see it. Bottom of the corner, baby. Ours 
 For the taking. 
 Verse one: Big Pun 
 Yo; I've seen child blastin a man, some with them are turning to murderers 
 Let us stray by the liars' death clause, fires observing us 
 Watching us close, marking our toast ??? is purposely overtaxing the earnings 
 Nervous, burning down the churches 
 They're scared of us rather beware than dare to trust 
 Throw us in jail, million dollar bail, left there to rust 
 Lets call in order, give ourselves a chance to enhance, broader 
 Advance where the minorities are the majority voter 
 Holding my own, I'm living alone in this cold world 
 My sister just bought a home without a loan, you know girl 
 She's an exception, some people can leap to the impression 
 See, me, myself I start flippin and fall victim to deep depression 
 I'm stressing the issue here, so we can cross the fiscal year 
 Tired of getting fired and hired as a pistolier 
 There's no longevity living off negativity 
 Fuck it, I'd rather sell reefer than do pizza delivery 
 That's how the city be, everybody gettin' they hustle on 
 Judge singin' death penalty like it's his favorite fucking song 
 Word is bond, taking my life you know they lovin' it 
 Got off the government and its fuckin' capital punishment 
 Chorus: Prospect 
 Capital punishment, given by the government 
 Systems they organized they get to you and who you running with 
 Can't live alone, watch for the spots and tapped phones 
 Totin the K, yo, for life, the rifle heir to the throne 
 We came from kings in Queens, people with dreams 
 Gods and herbs, for what its worth 
 We gonna fit the Earth with infinite worth 
 First its turning tables, open our own labels 
 They say don't vote the Republicans, then reverse capital punishment 
 Verse two: Big Pun 
 I've seen it all up close, shit without the movies you'd be buggin 
 My cousin Juju, barely a juve' lost it and turned on the oven 
 He wasn't playin', blew out the flame and started inhalin 
 Baring a secret too deep to keep on the streets for sharin 
 Wearing the virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
 Is dickin every thick premiscuous fish in the sea, 
 Listen to me, shit is rough in the ghetto, you bluff, blow your head off 
 Fuck a snuff, we bust lead off! 
 Get off your high horse, or die off like an extinction 
 Boricuans are like Mohicans, The Last of the Po-Ricans, 
 We need some unity for all the deep security 
 The maturity, keeps me six feet, above obscurity 
 The streets are deadly and everybody's a desperado 
 I guess tomorrow ain't promised unless you Amish and death's your motto 
 Like Zorro, I mark my territory with a symbol 
 Not with a Z, but a P, cause punishment's what I resemble! 
 I lend you this if it expands yours, for you and yours 
 A real man can't fall, he stands tall 
 The Man's claws are diggin in my back, I'm trying to hit him back 
 Time to counteract, where my niggaz at? 
 Verse three: Prospect 
 You like that, It's Pun and Prospect 
 We hold nines, own more treasure than goldmines, making progress 
 With Don Juan's, there's rules to be made, crews to be sprayed 
 Dues to be paid, nothing y'all can do to behave 
 We laid in the slums, made a cake out of crumbs 
 Even though the government, trying to take out our sons 
 Rudy Giuliani trying to blind me, but I see reality 
 Was raised with this street mentality 
 My strategies wide, my battery never die 
 The ghetto kept me wise, so I would never fall to the lies 
 Its no surprise, but to or die if you want the glamour 
 Yeah, I want the glamour, laid up with cheese and trees in Atlanta 
 My Cubans smoked out like Ronald Isley with Havanas 
 The hammer hit 'em in the palm, never shaky, calm 'halers 
 This renegade blow through barricades like grenades 
 I turn the sun to shade, then the night back to day 
 Like the twenty-four hour rotation 
 I know the location, its just a little in-fo-mation 
 Here come the Squad, bringing the Terror for the nine-era 
 And let it rain on your fine leather, nigga, what?
