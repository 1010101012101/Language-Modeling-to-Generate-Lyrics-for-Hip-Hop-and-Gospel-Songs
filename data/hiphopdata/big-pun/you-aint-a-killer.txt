[Verse 1] 
 The harsh realities of life are takin' toll 
 Even Jesus Christ forsake my soul 
 Please tell me what price to pay to make it home 
 Take control — I'm makin' dough, but not enough to blow 
 J.O.'s, they lust my flows, but 'ey yo, I don't trust a soul 
 That's all I know or need to, these evil streets'll meet you 
 Halfway and eat you alive tryin' to survive illegal 
 I'll leave you lost, mount you on a cross, whip you like a horse 
 Sacrifice your life to a higher force, then I'll stomp your corpse 
 It's the Bronx of course, recognize the accent? 
 One of the last livin' still in action general assassins 
 Catchin' any wreck, blastin' any tech, smashin' any chest 
 Passin' any test — Charles Manson in the flesh 
 Any last requests before you meet your maker? 
 Sow what you reap or wake up, shakin' up a storm like Anita Baker 
 I'll take you straight to hell and fill your heart with hate 
 Incarcerate your fate in Satan's fiery lake, then I lock the gate 
 Make no mistake, this shit as real as Job, we follow the killer's code 
 When we come for you, tell me, where will you go? 
 Nowhere to run, hide, I'll find you and and silence your screams 
 And even if you kill me I'll still be in your fuckin' dreams 
 [Chorus] 
 You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk 
 From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk 
 Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap 
 From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat 
 [Verse 2] 
 You've made a grave mistake 
 Shouldn't of come here, you changed your fate 
 Your brains'll make the debut on the table when I raise the stakes 
 The pain is great but only for a second, it starts strong then lessens 
 Just when you restin', the Armaggedon sets in 
 Left him with [?] stress (T.S.), blessed him with no regrets (Yes) 
 Welcome to Hell, son — the threshold of death 
 Face the serpent: I blaze your person, you get laced for certain 
 Leavin' Jakes no trace to work from — close the case like curtains 
 I'm hurtin' head severely really tryin' to bring the pain 
 There's nothin' more satisfyin' than when you cryin', screamin' my name 
 It's not a game, it's Purple Rain, floods and bloodstains 
 Big Pun's my thug's name, bustin' my guns, that's my love thang 
 I'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your Adam's Apple 
 John Madden-tackle your corpse to hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle 
 That'll have to hurt, I'll work your body 'til it burst 
 Then curse tu vida, like a Brujeria verse 
 I'm worse than anything you ever been through, sick in the head and mental 
 Essentially meant to be the sole threat against you 
 When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken 
 Fakin' like you Satan, when I'm the rhymin' abomination 
 [Chorus] 
 You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk 
 From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk 
 Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap 
 From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat 
 You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk 
 From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk 
 Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap 
 From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat 
 [Verse 3] 
 It's hard to analyze which guys are spies— be advised, people 
 We recognize who lies— it's all in the eyes, chico 
 We read 'em and see 'em for what they are 
 D's in undercover cars, takin' my picture like I'm a fuckin' star 
 I'm up to par, my game is in a smash 
 With half a million in the stash 
 Passport with the gats, first name and last 
 Ask anybody if my men are rowdy 
 Give me the mini-shottie, I body a nigga for a penny probably 
 I'm obligated to anything if it's crime related 
 If it shine I'll take it, still in my prime and I finally made it 
 I hate the fact that I'm the last edition, properly a stash magician 
 Could've went to college and been a mathematician 
 Bad decisions kept me out the game, now I'm strictly out for cream 
 Doin' things to fiends I doubt you'll ever dream 
 My team's the meanest thing you ever seen 
 Measured by the heaven's kings, down to the devil's mezzanine 
 I've never screamed so loud— I'm proud to be alive 
 Most heads die by 25 or catch a quick 3 to 5 
 So be advised: the street's full of surprises 
 It's not what crew's the livest 
 One that survive, it's who's the wisest 
 [Chorus] 
 You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk 
 From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk 
 Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap 
 From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat 
 You ain't a killer, you still learnin' how to walk 
 From New York to Cali all the real niggas carry chalk 
 Mark you for death, won't even talk that East or West crap 
 From Watts to LeFrak, it ain't where you're from it's where's your gat 
 You ain't a killer...
