Zapata's blood 
 Wasn't spilled in vain 
 So now your moves pullin' moves pullin' 
 Moves pullin' moves pull 
 Wage war wage war 
 To reclaim their name 
 Zapata's blood 
 Wasn't spilled in vain 
 So now your moves pullin' moves pullin' 
 Moves pullin' moves pull 
 Wage war wage war 
 To reclaim there terrain! 
 On January 1st, 1994 
 The indigenous farmers of Southern Mexico 
 Declared war on an unjust 
 And illegitimate government 
 Out of the depths of the most wild, the most poor 
 Came a just arms struggle 
 For democracy, justice and liberty 
 And it won't stop until that 
 65 year old dictatorshipt 
 The Partido Revolucionario Institucional is buried in the ground and 
 The people's voice is heard once again. 
 Yeah 
 So check it out 
 On January 1st of '94 they became known as the Zapatista movement 
 And they have a saying 
 And I want you all to sing along with me real quick 
 It goes somthing like this 
 It goes, 
 Everything For Everyone And Nothing For Ourselves (repeat 8x)
