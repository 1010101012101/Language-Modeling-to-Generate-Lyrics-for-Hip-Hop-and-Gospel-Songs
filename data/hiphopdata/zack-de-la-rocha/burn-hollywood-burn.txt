Zack de la Rocha: 
 Babylon fall, 
 Yes y'all I'm like ??? 
 Stylist 
 Wild on a blacklist 
 Check how they strangled his life 
 Hollywood the edge of the government knife 
 Exit the age of the black pawn 
 I won't stand for the dawn's 
 Early light, it never shined on my kind 
 So let the flame take flight 
 Trap vandalist 
 Mad with this 
 Fist cause life gets hard 
 As an amethyst 
 Attack this veil of hate 
 And smash this ill vision 
 Of blackness 
 Scripted like animals on display 
 Feel like Diallo in a doorway 
 Hate come 41 shots a scene 
 Yo Chuck pass the kerosene 
 Burn Hollywood x16 
 Malik B (I think, can't tell who) 
 ??? 
 Racing the clock 
 Sparking a flame 
 Now Hollywood's 
 Sweltering hot 
 Now that's a mother-fucking ??? 
 Hip-hop for real ??? 
 Black actors and actresses 
 They can't catch no ??? positive 
 I lick shots ??? 
 We call it a pose 
 Spittin' flames outta black holes 
 It's over, that's how that goes 
 Black Thought: 
 We burn from the silver screen 
 To rap shows 
 Where the beat drops 
 ??? The heart rolls 
 Now ??? 
 Three hundred and sixty degree 
 Radiating live by the S P 
 Just breathe deep to it 
 Till the chest heave 
 Who wanna see the black people 
 With the breast feed 
 Who telling the cops to freeze 
 Black Thought down with the PE 
 Leaving ashes of palm trees 
 Burn Hollywood x16 
 Chuck D: 
 Burn Hollywood Burn 
 While some of y'all still ain't learning 
 People the pay the price in real life 
 Minds and souls, sold and controlled 
 By the same ??? created by assholes 
 Who find reactors instead of actors 
 To react thus financially play a factor 
 No matter how whack the flick is 
 The fact is, how much the bling bling 
 Crowd reacted 
 Damn, little dot on the map I attack 
 Pimpin' TV movies and the third ??? 
 Damn right I'm hating 
 Since birth of the nation 
 Still waiting for decision makers 
 Who avoided one side 
 I got IQ rehab to get my brain back 
 I'm at a point of no return 
 I ain't crazy, 
 Burn Hollywood Burn 
 Burn Hollywood x16
