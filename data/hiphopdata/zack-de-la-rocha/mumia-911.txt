(The unbound allstars) 
 Afu Ra: 
 We need masters in biology to overtake 
 Illuminati tricknology 
 Transform reciprocate your mental state 
 Now make a date to overtake you objective 
 Show that through life everything is connected 
 But not in categories 'cause that's the devil's story 
 Symbols of cannibalism ruin your vision 
 And thoughts formulate in your mind with no precision 
 Goldii Lokks: 
 He paid a cruel price for what they call life 
 Dealt with it briefly took him out that night 
 Some ask why must they hate the look in his eyes 
 Like the child an ill omen they want him crucified 
 The last on the battlefield the last alive 
 Beside they don't want the African to survive 
 Sabo the son of Satan was involved in the plot 
 Legalized the homicide his soul gonna rot 
 Pharoahe Monch: 
 When you take the attempted assassination of Mumia Jamal they set 'em up 
 I come to find out Tupac wet 'em up 
 Pharoahe standin behind my fuckin' curtains with a double barrel 
 Rehearsin 
 Ready for war now for certain 
 Biological warfare suits black gas masks black boots 
 Half ass niggas become troops 
 My tons of global warriors is booty now 
 Plenty thug niggas is fruity now 
 Aceyalone: 
 Freedom is that cold road seldom traveled by the multitude 
 We need to dig through this gravel so we can cultivate this food 
 Motivate a few of you fools regenerate the mood 
 Free ourselves from the mental bondadge free ourselves from family feuds 
 And follow me through this prophecy building our colonies 
 While our pillars and columns be bigger than the colleseum 
 I call 'em like I see 'em the Devil does a devil dance 
 Now they wanna murder Mumia, take action is the only chance 
 Wise Intelligent: 
 They telling me son grab a gun or two money gonna come to you 
 Stop rhymin bout what white people done to you 
 Look burn a blunt or two screw who you wanna screw do what you wanna do 
 A lesson wait for you 
 Kill all that teacher shit there's too much cheese to get 
 And if Jesus exists just don't believe in it 
 Eat the bread of wickedness join The Global Satanists 
 Give death row sentences to black revolutionists 
 Slimkid 3: 
 Now they were playin' God just to feel the power 
 Not to justify that of you and I 
 Holdin' daggers up and lettin you decide 
 After passin information that's falsified 
 Stand behind a lie? What does it cost to die? 
 What does is cost to live? Why do they specify? 
 These terms of why when they ain't the most high 
 What they fear the will kill but the soul will never die 
 Sayeed: 
 Through seasons lesions and demons bleedin heathens and even stevens 
 I've wandered through regions 
 These freezin evenings and greaving till breathing reasons 
 Would freeze cats like Cleveland 
 Now she's seeming like seamen sliding home on the deagan 
 Within my mental from potential through Mumia's mind 
 Behind these bars Diamond scarred for the cause 
 I climbed on 50 schemes to lock cats in mars like dogs 
 The fog will clear like tears after a resolution 
 In this daily flight through Revolution 
 Zack de la Rocha: 
 You see the Capitol Thugs got nervous 'cause 
 He refused to be they servant 
 'Cause he spit truths that shook heads that burned like black churches 
 Pros and verses filled with a million black herses 
 Watch see the decision of Dread Scott reverses 
 So long as they rope is tight around Mumia's neck 
 Let there be no rich white life we bound to respect 
 Cause and effect Can't you smell the smoke in the breeze? 
 My Panther my Brother we are at War until you're free! 
 Gene Gray (a.k.a. What? What?): 
 I plan to move my motherfuckers to the front line 
 Ready with guns cocking 
 We'll storm the prisons get the wards rockin' 
 Snipe all the FBI and cops clockin 
 Philly officials bodies droppin' 
 Avenge the 85 bombing I for an I 
 We'll hang 'em by the capitol steps 
 Snap they necks snatch they vests equip my children with texts 
 Peep 'em protectin feds calling murder legal execution shit 
 Free the Righteous I face the bloody revolution It's on 
 Tragedy: 
 Federal indictment Militant mind Elightenment 
 Son we outburst in the courtroom full of excitement 
 Face the jury thugged out with blind fury 
 They want us all under the jam end of story 
 Brave and heartless We can have million marches 
 But when you black you under attack son regardless 
 Live by the gun dun and die by they gun 
 And Revolutionize minds until freedom's won 
 Channel Live: 
 We watch wizards play games in Washington with your life 
 Swung with Spiderman now we swing Web Sites 
 Double you dot 
 HellskitchenlivinillconditionbodycloninswitchinCIAlynchin 
 Mumia trapped in prison 
 Marilyn Manson mainstream Aliens visiting 
 My skins a misdemean when sirens beat screams 
 They wonder why the Live Channel got attitude 
 The times got us heated like zero degrees Lattitude 
 Can you keep a secret like society? They eye is on the rooftop 
 They got me under surveillance like they had Biggie and Tupac 
 Yo I saw two rocks and heard two shots 
 Then the level of my view dropped 
 They braised me but it didn't phase me I fired back and hit two cops 
 Yo I rumble through the jungle like Indiana Jones 
 With the key that unlocks the science of Microphones 
 Hit reverse disperse hysteria planet earth 
 Because the first shall be last and the last shall be first 
 Dead Prez: 
 Yo if Mumia dies Fires in the skies Rebel cries re-politicize 
 Brothers with their lives uncovered 
 Look for me in the whirlwind There to struggle there to win 
 Long live the Panthers comrades with answers 
 Freeing all political prisoners of war 
 Freeing the poor Open the door Keep your hands off Assata 
 Stop the ism schism prison economy that we live in 
 Impeach the president Keep on fighting till they give in 
 I say fuck the police 'cause they've been killing us for years 
 This ain't no free country niggas get murdered for their ideas 
 Free Mumia means all Africans let go 
 'Cause just livin' in the ghetto puts you on Death Row 
 You don't know? You seen they tried to do Assata 
 Until some real niggas organized themselves and went and got her 
 A lot of crackers verbalize if Mumia dies Fire in the skies 
 But only time will tell the truth from the lies 
 Chuck D: 
 As you peep the illusion 'cause I see my people losin 
 The overall battle to keep republicrats from choosin' 
 After all I feel the bruisin of the constitution 
 While my back's against the wall manifestin in their destiny 
 Shit they're just testin' me Mumia's spirit blessin' me 
 No alibi I know Allah is not the ally 
 I believe I can fly but that type of Freedom is a lie 
 So fuck the government CIA and FBI 
 Divine Styler: 
 In the holy month of Ramadan 
 Doing Dawah in degrees within the means of 
 God speed feel the supreme 
 Penalties black non-fiction remains the weapon of choice 
 Reject the illusion of justice in white-ears the black voice 
 The passion behind the veil 
 The flesh behind the bars 
 The spirit afront the force 
 Why the death what's the cause 
 Break the black man down in front of the blackfam and all 
 Guilty is you all 
 Free Mumia Abu-Jamal 
 The Last Emperor: 
 See time will destroy anything for the right price 
 In the physical world one man cannot die twice 
 To the spiritual world your sould cannot fly twice 
 Yet could this be the second time they crucify Christ 
 Ask Ed Asner the actor after they execute him 
 There will be a peasant uprising like the French Revolution 
 In conclusion if you detect evil 
 Free the Voice of the Voiceless defender of oppressed people 
 Black Thought: 
 They want us knocked locked down boxed up in the ground 
 It's wartime now for how the sufferin sound 
 We deep in the Realm The planet petrified overwhelmed 
 We all stars livin' life on surveillance film 
 New world law enforce Mind rate cerebral holocaust no escape 
 Fire burn the execution date shatter 
 We on the front lines prepared 
 I want Mumia out the cage the time for action is here 
 P.E.A.C.E.: 
 This is a PSA to the PSC and PPD 
 Mumia Abu-Jamal must be set free 
 How would you like it if we took it to the streets in a discreet fashion 
 Still smashin Underground arsenal of lyricists 
 Live from Death Row 
 We want the Voice of the Voiceless fully clothed and ready to go 
 And if not you will witness the largest uprising you've ever seen before 
 April twenty fourth 1954
