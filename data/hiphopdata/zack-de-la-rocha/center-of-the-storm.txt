Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, 
 Bless, this vision I sketch a war cry can't rest, 
 Across frequencies east and west style, 
 Raw adrenaline, let's tap the vein main line resistance, meditate maintain, 
 Raw to settle, the matter the cops scattered, our blood 
 Lost so matter of fact no love lost 
 See me cock the steely 
 Lock on Mussolini's ill logic on the minds of the flock 
 No line divides, violence and reason sold 
 This killing season is freezing souls, zero degrees and cold 
 There's 41 reasons to blast back 
 No one, followed Diallo to the grave... fade to black. 
 While all my city is heavy 
 I drop elephant shit smeared the face of the 
 Fascist priest's pulpit 
 So to the mayor may I, say I, endorse the wholesale murder of your force of course 
 'Cause peace is a myth in New York, 
 Burn in white rock star court 
 Don't choke, if ya smell smoke, (what?) 
 I dip my tongue in gunpowder and then I clear my throat 
 The Aggravator, true shit spitter Mobb like Goodie 
 While my hoody hides my eyes 
 The critics rush me like, 
 Salman Rushdie as I, 
 Enter the center of the storm with Size 
 Enter the center of the storm with Size 
 Enter the center of the storm 
 I toss pieces of my syllables like salt by a sumo 
 Call me Akibono Yokozuna, numero uno, 
 Puro Mejicano my angle is I dangle styles for 
 The flock to follow 
 Too deep for the shallow 
 Superstitious niggas that get played like a tarot 
 Bass lines rattle and will shatter your bone marrow 
 Blind and can't see me, believe me Stevie 
 No need to Wonder how, Monche became the pharaoh 
 Tongue acrobatter, none 
 Phatter, never narrow I shot the sheriff and 
 Beretta and the sparrow got the gift like Gab, 
 Rip your rib cage hollow funk the flame into your brain 
 Matter with the sharpest arrows 
 The Aggravator, true shit spitter 
 Mobb like Goodie while my hoody hides my eyes 
 The critics rush me like, 
 Salman Rushdie as I, 
 Enter the center of the storm with Size 
 Enter the center of the storm with Size 
 Enter the center of the storm 
 Lets attract, Lets attract, (what? what? what?) 
 Lets attract, Lets attract, (what? what? what?) 
 From my mental sparks fly, why is do or die 
 5-0 got automatics, so why can't i? 
 Fly by fast like an assassin mashin' 
 Soon we'll see the beast reach for the sky 
 But for now I keep my mind sharp 
 We'll be them bang this track in the park after dark 
 Lips do flips never kicked fiction 
 2000 class summon now face the guns of Brixton 
 Break to face them, never check reality 
 On it with Roni we devastate the scenery 
 Aggravator, true shit spitter 
 Mobb like Goodie while my hoody hides my eyes 
 The critics rush me like, 
 Salman Rushdie as I, 
 Enter the center of the storm with Size 
 Enter the center of the storm with Size 
 Enter the center of the storm 
 Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, 
 Enter the center of the storm 
 Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, 
 Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, 
 Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, Storm, 
 Our jurisdiction the world 
 Our jurisdiction the world 
 Our jurisdiction the world 
 Our jurisdiction the world
