 Aiight 
 I was born with the voice of a riot, a storm 
 Lightening the function, the form 
 Far from the norm, I won't follow like cattle 
 I'm more like the catalyst, 
 Calm in the mix of battle 
 Who let the cowboy on the saddle? 
 He don't know a missile from a gavel 
 Para terror troopin' flippin' loops of death upon innocent flesh 
 But I'm back in the cipher my foes and friends 
 With a verse and a pen 
 Against a line I won't tow or defend 
 Instead I curse at murderous men 
 In suits of professionals who act like animals 
 This man child, ruthless and wild 
 Who's gonna chain this beast back on the leash? 
 This Texas fuhrer, for sure a 
 Compassionless con who serve a 
 Lethal needle to the poor, the cure for crime is murder? 
 Well I was born with the voice of a riot, a storm 
 Lightening the function, the form 
 Far from the norm, I won't follow like cattle 
 I'm more like the catalyst, 
 Calm in the mix of battle 
 Who let the cowboy on the saddle? 
 He don't know a missile from a gavel

 I read the news today 
 Oh boy 
 A snap shot of a midnight ploy 
 Vexed and powerless 
 Devoured my hours I'm motionless 
 With no rest 
 'Cause a scream now holds the sky 
 Under another high-tech driveby 
 A lie is a lie this God is an eagle 
 Or a condor for war nothing more 
 Islam peace, Islam stare into my eye brother 
 Please off our knees 
 To beef now we feed their disease 
 Interlocked our hands across seas 
 What is a flag is a rag but a shroud out loud 
 Outside my window is a faceless crowd 
 'Cause a cowering child just took her last breath 
 One snare in the march of death 
 Uh 
 C'mon 
 Get up 
 On the left 
 On the left, left, right, left 
 On the left 
 On the left, left, right, left (but it's just a march of death)

 Here it comes the sound of terror from above 
 He flex his Texas twisted tongue 
 The poor lined up to kill in desert slums 
 For oil that burn beneath the desert sun 
 Now we spit flame to flip this game 
 All the targets are taking aim 
 All targets are taking aim 
 We're the targets are taking aim

 Left, right, left
