(El Debarge) 
 How many times I had to tell you baby 
 I ain't got nothin' to prove to you, no no 
 Doin' the things you know that's gonna to drive me crazy 
 Thinkin' I don't need the shit you're going through 
 When I come home at night, I try to lay my head down 
 You do the things that keep me away 
 It's like you love to hear me argue fuss and fight, girl 
 How much am I supposed to take? 
 If you feel like I feel you wouldn't act this way, girl 
 Is this the price I have to pay? 
 Ah, baby, but 
 (Chorus: repeat 2X) 
 All I wanna do is 
 Make sure that nothing's wrong with my kids 
 So we can get along and still be friends 
 (El Debarge) 
 I stuck around 'cause I thought things were gon' get better 
 I shoulda had more trust in me, uh uh oh oh 
 I know you tricked around when we went through our thing 
 Steady spending time with him but you were coming home to me 
 You didn't care what I thought you had to have your way girl 
 You had your cake and ate it too 
 I still try to look out although you did me wrong 
 Getting even just ain't cool 
 If you feel like I feel you wouldn't act this way, girl 
 Ain't nothing left for me to say 
 But to tell you that 
 (El Debarge) 
 All of my children, yeah yeah 
 Make sure that nothing's wrong with all my childrens 
 Yeah, you're my babies 
 Make sure nothing's wrong 
 With my children 
 'Cause you know I love them 
 You know I can't live without my children, yeah 
 Ooh
