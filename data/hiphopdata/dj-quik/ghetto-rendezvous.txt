Rendezvous, I guess it's time for another 
 Aw, look at what you muthafuckas done went and did 
 Y'all done pissed off 
 Yeah, what up, sis? I hear you out there 
 You know you done fucked up 
 I'm glad y'all set it off 
 You prolly mad 'cause you can't eat off me no more 
 Don't wanna hear you cryin' or offer you no dough 
 You tried to make my life shabby 
 With the zodiac sign of the cancer, you crabby 
 Plus you got away with murder twice, nice 
 Just like that nigga that's on thin ice now 
 I think it's time for another ghetto rendezvous 
 I hate you so much, it just shows 
 I hate you more than Michael hated Joe 
 And your son looks like a fuckin' Al Qaeda 
 I'mma call him whop daddy 'cause his chin is to the side, yo 
 Now that's the mark of the beast 
 You had a Damien in 1977 to say the least 
 Your house is full of mole, body full of yeast 
 I bet you bakin' a loaf of bread down between your cheeks 
 You stanky little rodent, yeah, bitch, you molded 
 You never see your brother that's why your love's corroded 
 Emphysema all in him 
 You can't hurt nobody, ain't no toxins in your venom 
 You just a grandmama in denim 
 Looking for some little kids to put some shit up in them 
 Maybe it's time for another ghetto rendezvous 
 The problem is you ain't have no fuckin' loyalty 
 And the only thing you wanted was my royalties 
 You stole a car and a bike from me 
 Lookin' back, I was the caretaker of a dummy 
 And that husband of yours, you dumb witch 
 Was still a husband of hers, you stupid bitch 
 You never acted your age 
 You only came to embarrass me out in public for days 
 That's why a little clarity pays 
 You got the boot, now I'm chipping like Frito lays 
 Rest in peace to my niece Delyse 
 When she was lying in state, she had a grin on her mouthpiece 
 Now what that tell you about you 
 You disturbed to the curb and it's better without you 
 I'm coming strapped to another ghetto rendezvous 
 Fat boy, you know you really been dummin' 
 Going over peewee house showing off your triple stomach 
 With a strap in your waist 
 Now what you gon' do when you see my face? I doubt it 
 I'm tired of playing with you cocka roaches 
 I gave you bitches life trust and you stupids broke it 
 'Cause you a muthafuckin' sex offender 
 Put some honey on your dick and put it in a blender 
 They caught you fuckin' on your sister daughter 
 That some incestuous shit, get the holy water 
 Compton alumni a-no go 
 Nigga, you really for passer robos 
 Upstate in Y.A. with your homeboys 
 Cheekin' each other butt making no noise 
 I'm takin' off when I hit the ghetto rendezvous 
 If I bought you equipment and you sold it, that's on you 
 Helped you get into a home and you lose it, that's on you 
 You niggaz acting like babies 
 You feeling entitled to another man's money, that's crazy 
 More like insane, schizophrenia 
 Struggles with love and money, happiness you got plenty of 
 While I'm staying fly like LaGuardia 
 I'm a guardian, I'm the ardista 
 I'm the flyest MC that you've ever heard 
 On the nrmal microphone, muthafucka, that's word 
 Now give me the mic and let me be heard 
 'Cause I'll be quitting surely, I am the shep-erd 
 Now what you know about my lyrics and style? 
 I got a clico backwash, fly spit, we wild 
 I think it's time for another ghetto rendezvous
