 Well 1991 I was rockin' my jerri curl, just a young gun 
 Lookin' for the bitches that have alot of fun, 
 Just dropped a hit record now I'm under the sun 
 Winter time night fall cold as hell 
 Standin' out side of the Goldentail 
 Hella hoes mobbin in pushin gettin' through 
 Tiger striped cat suit lookin' at me to 
 I asked her what's your title and she said it was V 
 Vanessa you impress a nigga can't you see 
 What you doin' later can I kick it with you? 
 She said it all depends on what you wanna do 
 Took me me to her buddy walked in the room 
 Buzzin off the kamikaze that I consumed 
 Talk, kiss, grind tyrin' to get get my balls off first 
 She said nigga can you take my drawls of first 
 I was young I admit it 
 She told me I was horny and wild but still let me hit it 
 Hot bare back until I felt that quake 
 She told me shoot that milk shaker shoot that milk shaker 
 Goddamn I don't wanna get sprung 
 Take it out the pussy bust a nut on her tummy 
 Ran home to tell my nigga Top 
 About this cock that just would'nt stop yeah 
 I told him she was greeneyed light skinned and fly 
 He said he met a bitch like that last July 
 A car pulled up and it was her no doubt

 And its freakin me out 
 'Cause she fine than a motherfucker bout 5'8 
 135 and I just can't wait (for what) 
 To hit the backside, and get the top love 
 Bucknaked in the hot tub 
 'Cause she knew who I was and what I am and what I is (who are you) 
 The flyest nigga in the rap biz 
 And there playin' my song so a nigga gotta go and uh 
 Put a hoe in the limo

 Now who gon do the honors 
 I hit the liquor next to benihana's 
 But on my way I met bitch as square as a box 
 With a big ass booty and some goldie locks 
 And I ain't gotta do much talkin' she wet 
 Because she seen me movin' a 97 berett 
 The good thing is I never seen her around 
 So I took her to my spot to get down
