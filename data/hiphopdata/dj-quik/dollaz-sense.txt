Now let's get down to business, bitches 
 'Cause it seems like y'all just keep on tryin' to diss this 
 Nigga that you know that's been down for years 
 I've clowned for years, and y'all could never fade my peers 
 One two three four five six seven nine, ten, Eiht you can't win 
 'Cause all the way around nigga I gets respect 
 And youse a nigga that can't even get no props in your set 
 Tragniew Park you say huh 
 Wanna be rippin', but now it's time to do some set trippin' 
 So listen close, 'cause I don't want y'all to miss 
 That I'm bout to break it down for this bitch, check it 
 Acacia, Poplar Maple Spruce Cedar Elm 
 West side trees sprayin' all the fleas 
 That's from the three and four hundred block P-Funk riders 
 So niggaz watch yo' ass at that center divider 
 Now Aaron Tyler, tell my why you seem so tame 
 When I caught you at the airport, shakin' like a crap game 
 You looked up and you seen my niggaz comin' 
 And you looked like your bitch ass was 'bout to start runnin' 
 But all I wanted to do was kick a little conversation 
 And see if we can fix this little situation 
 But would I fuck you up was what you wondered 
 Yeah, that's probably why you changed your little pager number 
 But bitches like you don't grow 
 You can't even look me in my eye, let alone go toe to toe 
 And callin' me skinny, youse a clown 
 I'ma call you Theo, 'cause you weigh ninety-two point three pounds 
 Wack ass actor, movie script killer 
 Fool don't you know, Quik is still the nigga 
 Compton psycho, boy you oughta quit 
 Your records don't hit, and bitches don't jock your shit 
 You need to stay down you Compton clown 
 And get off of the nuts of the niggaz with guts 
 Because I'm down with the Trees, I'm down with Death Row 
 I'm down with Black Tone, and I'm down with the fo' 
 So when we cross paths and I hope that's soon 
 I'ma boot your motherfuckin' ass to the moon 
 You need to quit bangin' under false pretense 
 'Cause if don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence 
 If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 So don't kill game, let the people, commence 
 If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence 
 If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince 
 Now I'ma swing it to the right and, right into the left hand 
 Take a deep breath and, cook it like a chef and 
 This is dedicated to the C-P-T 
 No better yet T-T-P, or the niggaz that look up to me 
 I make it my business, to be that true forever 
 And whenever I can come clever well that's my endeavor 
 So whether or not you understand, that there's only one DJ Q-U-I-K 
 With no C still you can't be me 
 Because I'm floatin' in my Lex and, depositin' fat checks and 
 Gettin' mad sex while I floss the NSX and 
 Doin' what I wanna, and youse a goner nigga 
 For thinkin' that you can catch me slippin' on a street corner 
 Remember Compton's in the house, and Quik is in the hood 
 Sippin' yak with all my niggaz 'cause it's tooted good 
 So don't knock it till you try it, 'cause Eiht he tried to knock it 
 But he's still walkin' round with my nuts in his pocket 
 So put tha P in it represent and sip that Miller 
 And for those of y'all concerned, this is still Eiht Killa 
 Let me take a load off my scrotum little pest 
 If it don't make dollars nigga, you know the rest 
 If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence 
 If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 So don't kill game, let the people, commence 
 If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence 
 If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince 
 Now I done sold my fuckin' soul to the shit that I kick 
 While you groupie ass niggaz keep on ridin' the dick 
 You oughta know that DJ Quik ain't your average 
 Everyday motherfucker, slick like a snake 'cause I stuck ya 
 Now, I never had my dick sucked by a man befo' 
 But you gon' be the first you little trick ass hoe 
 Then you can tell me just how it taste 
 But before I nut I shoot some piss in your face 
 You fuckin' coward, tremblin' like a nervous wreck 
 'Cause when I caught your ass, you put yourself in check 
 And when you left my presence, you left expedient 
 You ain't no fuckin' killer, youse a comedian, beyotch 
 Tell me why you act so scary 
 Givin' your set a bad name wit your misspelled name 
 E-I-H-T, now should I continue 
 Yeah you left out the G 'cause the G ain't in you 
 Remember that time you was rollin' on the West side 
 And a little brown bucket pulled up on your side 
 Caught at that light in your Camry in the midst of a 
 Real killer, tell me did you feel a little nervous 
 You was in the shadow of death with two trey-five-sevens 
 Pointed at your chest whatchu gon' do, where was your 
 Niggaz that kill at you ain't got no killers so kill dat 
 Holdin' up your hands and beggin' for a pass 
 You lucky they didn't just to get to dumpin' on yo' ass 
 'Cause this game you think is funny is some real shit 
 So you need to be more careful who you fuckin' wit, beyotch! 
 If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence 
 If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 I'm through playin' with your punk ass 
 If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 So don't kill game, let the pimpin' commence 
 If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense 
 Because you gotta give it up to the crown prince 
 Shouts goes out, to my well known road dog 
 What's up Dozun Tru, they don't understand it baby 
 They can't fade us out here on these Compton streets 
 It's bigger than they can imagine to the whole entire 
 Death Row family both sides, whassup niggaz 
 And my nigga Big Suge, known for keepin' shit poppin' 
 To my nigga Big J, my little nigga Hi-C, little straight G 
 And that little singin' ass nigga Danny Boy 
 Y'all don't understand, y'all can't fade this 
 I'm the first nigga that was "Bangin' on Wax" 
 Yeah if you remember, nineteen eighty-seven underground tapes 
 And it don't stop, and it won't stop
