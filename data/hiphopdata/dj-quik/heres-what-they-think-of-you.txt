 Seen a nigga smile so I turned and asked, why your mouth got so much plaque, thinking you the shit all young and sporty, can't wait to see your grill when you turn 40, I'm a sex symbol and you can't pronunciate, but 2pac passed so they sing it anyway, stretching pintos yah, you flossing poorly, you need to pump yo brakes, yeah slow down whodi
