I can be a little picky 
 Blame the sticky-icky 
 Pick a bottle, get a glass 
 Down the sippy sippy 
 I see you baby keep bouncin' on your tippy toes 
 When the beat drop dip and make the booty roll 
 Cold piece of work fillin' out your mini skirt 
 It's Saturday night, should probably wear that shit to church 
 You sick of lame dudes frontin' wit attitude 
 Talking bout their rims and all they damn tennis shoes 
 I got some grown man game for your Bluetooth 
 I'm hot middle of winter coupe no roof 
 You used to sushi then you know want some calamari 
 You want a nigga that might grow up and be somebody 
 O.T resorts by the sea 
 Sand between your toes, umbrellas in your drinks 
 Worldwide aim 
 Hit me on the G-Mail 
 I brought my boy wit me so bring another female 
 Diamonds on my fingers, a couple on my toes 
 Walk in to the party and seen so many hoes 
 Can you work wit that 
 Can you work wit that 
 Can you work wit that 
 I can work wit that 
 Cali to the A 
 We speeding on the freeway 
 In the stretch LS, baby we hood fellas 
 Can you work wit that 
 Can you work wit that 
 Can you work wit that 
 I can work wit that 
 (Verse 2: DJ Quik) 
 Lemme do my job girl don't make it easy for me 
 Tomorrow morning make my eggs with onions cheesy for me 
 Come get the keys to the suite up at the soapy tail 
 True kid 24 and I'm goin' meet you there 
 Take a bubble bath 
 Get the robe out the closet and wait for me 
 Don't think that I'm afraid to toss it 
 You hate for me 
 Stand you up and makes you nauseous 
 I'm late but can't go to sleep because your pussy gorgeous 
 It's Quik baby 
 I don drop the DJ 
 You might see me in GA 
 Just showin' off my LA 
 Some many apple bottom freaks showin' belly 
 I might give 
 And take it to the telle 
 She in the DoubleTree suites 
 With her hands on her hips 
 A look in her eye and smile on her lips 
 It's that southern hospitality 
 That's my reality 
 We hit the waffle house and finish with some aleezay 
 Diamonds on my fingers, a couple on my toes 
 Walk in to the party and seen so many hoes 
 Can you work wit that 
 Can you work wit that 
 Can you work wit that 
 I can work wit that 
 Cali to the A 
 We speeding on the freeway 
 In the stretch LS, baby we hood fellas 
 Can you work wit that 
 Can you work wit that 
 Can you work wit that 
 I can work wit that
