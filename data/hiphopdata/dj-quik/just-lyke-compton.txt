Finally out the mothafuckin' C P T 
 Off to other cities and shit, no longer just a underground hit 
 Moving things, a local nigga made good 
 And made a name off making tapes for niggers in the hood 
 And now let me tell a little story 
 About the places that I been to and the shit that I been through 
 Like fighting and shoot-outs and banging and shit 
 All because a nigga made a hit, check it 
 Nineteen ninety-one, it was double or nothing that a nigga would hit 
 The we broke out with the funky shit 
 About bitches and niggas and gettin' drunk and off that bud 
 I was doing that shit they hadn't heard of 
 But foolish was I, to think that it wasn't no other city like this 
 And they didn't like this 
 That Compton was the home of a foot in your ass 
 Where you got blast and now that's a just a thing of the past 
 Let me tell you why first hand 
 We did a show up on Oakland and niggas was kicken up sand 
 To them banging ain't nothing new and slanging ain't nothing new 
 And for every nigga we done shot, they done shot two 
 Straight through and long since the sixties before I was born 
 Families of young niggas mourn so I'm just letting you know 
 That if you plan to take a trip to the bay keep your hand on the clip 
 Because Oakland is just like Compton 
 Yeah, I'm telling y'all Oakland is just like Compton fool 
 Moving on to St. Louis, where they country as fuck 
 With gold teeth in they mouth but they still know what's up 
 Where its as hot as a mother-fucker hot enough to make you cuss 
 That's why I kept my ass on the bus 
 But later on when it cooled off we came down 
 And met a couple of friends who put us on the St. Louis cap 
 The Smith Center, with Big Bob, Lil' Steve, Tojo, Biss and Rich 
 And a couple of bitches 
 Then they took us to a man named Gus in his store 
 He put me down with a herring-bone and shoes galore 
 That's when I started thinking that this wasn't like home 
 But then they had to prove me wrong 
 'Cause later that night after we did the show 
 We went back to the after set and wouldn't you know 
 Bloods and crips start scrappin' and shooting 
 In Missouri damn how could this happen? 
 Now St. Louis is just like Compton 
 Yeah y'all St. Louis is just like Compton, nigga 
 I don't think they know, they too crazy for they own good 
 They need to stop watching that colors and boyz in the hood 
 Too busy claiming sixties, trying to be raw 
 And never even seen the shaw 
 But now, back to the story that I'm telling 
 We packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailing 
 When we arrived I saw red and blue sweat suits 
 When I'm thinking about horse dookie and cowboy boots 
 I guess Texas ain't no different from the rest 
 And San Antonio was just waiting to put us to the test 
 And before it was over the shit got deep 
 A nigga got shot in the face and was dead in the street 
 Then they came in the club, thinking of scrapping 
 Little did they know that we was packing 
 Yeah, we was putting them down and scaring the rest, shit 
 I even had to wear the bulletproof vest 
 Now San Antonio is just like Compton 
 Yeah San Antonio is just like Compton, bitch 
 After about a month on the road 
 We came home and I could safely say 
 That L.A. is a much better place to stay 
 How could a bunch of niggas in a town like this 
 Have such a big influence on niggas so far away? 
 But still my story ain't over 'cause I got one more to tell 
 And the people of Colorado, they know it well 
 It was all in the news and if you don't remember 
 I had this show I did in Denver 
 With a punk ass promoter in a bunk ass skating rink 
 Bitches was loving it but niggas was shoving and shit 
 To the front of the stage to throw they gang signs 
 But I'm getting paid so I didn't pay it no mind 
 Then I poured out my brew onto their face and chests 
 Then they start throwing soda and fucking up my guests 
 When it was over two niggas needed stitches 
 Got cracked in they jaw, for being punk ass bitches 
 Now Denver is just like Compton 
 Yeah y'all Denver they want to be like Compton bitch 
 And you know that Oakland is just like Compton 
 Yeah y'all St. Louis we made it just like Compton fool 
 Uh huh San Antonio is just like Compton 
 Yeah and Denver they wanna be like Compton punk ass nigga 
 I thought you knew
