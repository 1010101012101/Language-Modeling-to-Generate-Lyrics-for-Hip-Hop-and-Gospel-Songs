DJ Quik: 
 Four, three, two 
 Let's count it off: one (one) 
 Now we gon' show you all to have fun (fun) 
 Get dressed and hit the club at 'bout two (two) 
 I'm a order me a Henny and a brew 
 And I'm a grab two girls or maybe three (three) 
 Now get on the dancefloor with me 
 We wanna know what you came for (four) 
 I wanna see you get it on the floor 
 Now we gon' push out about five (five) 
 I'm feelin' your buzz and beehive 
 Now let's go get some breakfast at six (six) 
 Out in front of the diner, we takin' pics 
 And I could see the red eye, it's like seven (seven) 
 Got the engine in the Tahoe revvin 
 Pick up the check and bounce about eight (eight) 
 Now it's time to put you up on the plate 
 Honey, I'll be the 6, you'll be the 9 (nine) 
 I gotta have you again, you're too fine (too fine) 
 Girl, you're better than 9, you're like dime (dime) 
 On a beautiful scale, you'll get a ten 
 Because you don't take up with all men (nah, nah) 
 You got me lost for time, it's 11: 30 
 And your body's like heaven, so curvy 
 So just one more time, you assume 
 So we can both be asleep by noon 
 Chorus - Jon B: 
 What are you gonna do today? Let me fly out to LA 
 Where the sun never hides behind the clouds 
 You peep the shore line when you landed, on the 4-5 now dippin 
 Whatever's on your mind's what we gon' do now 
 Oh yeah... 
 BlaKKazz K.K.: 
 I like your cinnamon buns dipped in Deréon 
 Feelin' the jeans just bustin' the seams 
 Make the K fiend, but whatcha game like? 
 Lookin' at you baby, I see ya frame right 
 We on the floor with the girls off tequila 
 Sexy, independent, party goin' divas 
 That like to drop it low, stop and go 
 Push back that ass, girl don't stop that show 
 Party hard, make a toast 
 By the end of the night doin' the most 
 I'm checkin' out ya pedicure package, ya well-managed 
 You're bilingual? I hit you with the Spanish 
 (¡Soy Culo a Negro, me dicen mandigo, con la culebra grande) 
 Yeah, I'm international, now you know 
 Lovin' the black and brown, I do it all 
 DJ Quik: 
 Now the Hollywood glitz and glamour, that's just one aspect 
 Still pack your camera, 'cause we got projects 
 Just like Atlanta but you might get seasick 
 So bring Mylanta, 'cause we got marinas and yachts and big mansions 
 And bubbly pourin on the patio I'm dancin 
 I kick it with Prince, but his house he was jammin 
 Plus I didn't have to fly out to Minneapolis 
 'Cause it's the metropolis, it's where they topless 
 It's where we party in the evening where the cops is 
 House of Blues day, Key Club Tuesday 
 Sunset crackin' a lot harder than where you stay 
 They come from the I.E., they comin' from Sandberg 
 They comin' from Phoenix and Las Vegas where the sand burns 
 They comin' from 'Frisco, they comin' from O-HI 
 They comin' from Memphis and Detroit and NY 
 But all of 'em fly 
 Outro - Jon B: 
 Oh yeah, yeah 
 What we gonna do now, babe, is 
 Party, party, party, baby party 
 Party, party, party, baby party 
 Party, party, party, baby party 
 Party, party, party, we gon' party 
 Oh yeah, whoa yeah 
 Party party party, like Uncle Charlie 
 Whoa, whoa-whoa yeah ye-yeah-yeah 
 Oh yeah yeah, oh whoa one time 
 For you mind baby, oh whoa, uh
