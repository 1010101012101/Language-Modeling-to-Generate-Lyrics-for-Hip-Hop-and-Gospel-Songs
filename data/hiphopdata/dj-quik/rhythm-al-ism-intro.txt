Talking: 
 Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps playas and women of the night, 
 Welcome to the world of Rhythm-al-ism. 
 Now since this is my intro, I'ma do somethin' a little crazy check it out. 
 We gon' show off a little bit now watch it, 'cause these ain't no studio 
 Tricks. 
 Hmph. 
 <Rapping with no breaks> 
 I glide smooth over any groove to prove that I can keep 
 On flowin' lyrics to the rhythm like a ride never tongue tied 
 Chillin' with the D K.K. AMG Suga Free Hi-C El D in the 
 P-E-N-T-H-O-U-S-E You'll see a whole 'nother different 
 Other side of me 'cause this is only part of me I snap 
 My fingers twice and like a bird your bitch'll fly to me 
 Because she's overwhelmed you know I gets the round 
 When I kick it my name is Quik and ask the chicken to 
 Let me stick it when she trick it my boys can hit the chicken 
 Roll deep like a Navy SEAL got her squirmin' like a eel 
 To kiss her on the cheek is rather ?? I rather rub my hand 
 Go way up in her skirt and make her scream so scream hoe up 
 If I trick another track it keep her coming back girls keep 
 Pubbin' it suckas steadily rubbin' it & I'ma keep rubbin' it in 
 Yo' face got it tight with the "-isms" hmph now welcome 
 To the world of the RHYTHM-AL-ISM! 
 <Heavy breathing at end>
