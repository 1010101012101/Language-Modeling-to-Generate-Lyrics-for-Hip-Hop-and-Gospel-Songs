All I want is for my time with you to slow down 
 Don't really make it in town like I used to 
 So for now 
 All I want is for my time with you to slow down 
 Don't really make it in town like I used to 
 So for now 
 I appreciate your patience 
 What am I doin' without you? 
 Never hear no bad shit out here 
 In the streets about you 
 Love just must have made you smart 
 Jealousy is the counterpart 
 Life has made us stripped apart 
 No more willing to embark 
 But we remained friends throughout 
 All those years from then to now 
 Both those feelings trust and doubt 
 Argue until you storm out 
 Other dude gave you a kid 
 He didn't have you like I did 
 I pieced you out and then y'all broke up 
 And you called me again 
 Drunk and crying on the phone 
 Next flight out you gon' be home 
 Flight delayed, I still wait 
 Call me when you reach the gate 
 Pick you up at baggage claim 
 Tunnel vision just begun 
 'Cause you and your son 
 Look like you and my son 
 All I want is for my time with you to slow down 
 Don't really make it in town like I used to 
 So for now 
 All I want is for my time with you to slow down 
 Don't really make it in town like I used to 
 So for now 
 All I need is more time 
 Is having you right beside me, you're mine 
 And only for a couple minutes more, slow down 
 Somebody say five and time a pillow 
 Know that if I could then I would pay full time 
 On some major shit, slow down 
 Dodgin' every minute like a bullet 
 Somebody say five and time a pillow 
 Let me get your bags out of the truck 
 Get the keys and go upstairs 
 Cover tattoos on your arm 
 That's just memories, souvenirs 
 We got plans tonight 
 We goin' to the cheese cake factory 
 And drink a little and reminisce about 
 How you used to laugh at me 
 You didn't think I would go too far 
 I mean being from Compton and all 
 But still I grabbed some corks, some yarn 
 And rubber and made myself a ball 
 I know your momma proud of me 
 'Cause she looked down on me 
 She knew I had it 
 She said that I would make it if I just stayed at it 
 Now how's your niece 
 The one who used to stay with you 
 When you lived on over by the street 
 The one who like my nephew Kiana 
 She used to do her hair like Rihanna 
 You remember my 
 Why you kiss me when I'm talking? 
 Just had to bring back all them old memories 
 So you ready to go? 
 You sure you don't wanna another drink? 
 Okay, let me get the check 
 All I need is more time 
 Is having you right beside me, you're mine 
 And only for a couple minutes more, slow down 
 Somebody say five and time a pillow 
 Know that if I could then I would pay full time 
 On some major shit, slow down 
 Dodgin' every minute like a bullet 
 Somebody say five and time a pillow, a pillow, a pillow 
 All I want is for my time with you to slow down 
 Don't really make it in town like I used to 
 So for now 
 All I want is for my time with you to slow down 
 Don't really make it in town like I used to 
 So for now
