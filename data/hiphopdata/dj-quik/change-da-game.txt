 Haha, I just had to do that once 
 Ay, T-P-T style 
 Jumpin' up outta the Burb', park mode 
 And 18 inches from the curb 
 While I'm smellin them stanky stenches from the herb 
 Red-eyed flight, and I'm lookin' for my red-eyed homie 
 Black Tone, 'cause I said I might 
 Just hafta pass through, and let 'em hear some shit that's pretty fat 
 From Spade Ty to King Tee, this is where it's at 
 Nigga, makin' million dollar deals at a checker table 
 And my nephews gonna be the youngest niggas with a record label 
 I'm the only nigga that promised to show up 
 With more talent than any nigga and I didn't wanna blow up 
 I shine like glitter 'cause I'm natural 
 If on the first night I hit, then that's a hoe 
 And I gotta stay away 
 You can never by mine your nigga he got you on layaway

 Gettin' wild like a buckin horse 
 With enough momentum to change the whole muthafuckin course 
 All I need nigga, is a crew and a point 
 And I'll make a statement only on a brew and a joint 
 No joke, 'cause growin' up dirty, hungry and broke 
 Don't mean I gotta be dirty, hungry and broke 
 Dude I made a way out a no way, and y'all can too 
 'Cause it's a whole lotta legal shit that y'all can do 
 And fuck the media, keep on steppin, yeah I said it 
 Where your pass at? Who you know here? Where you headed?

 More advanced than that wack nigga punchin a Lex 
 After Balance and Option, I'ma show ya who's next 
 Ain't no room in the court for cowards who can't ride 
 Ate up the dick, left the balls on the side 
 'Bout to take a trip to Neptune, everybody wanna roll 
 If you ain't loyal to the camp, nigga hell no 
 We about to change the game in many ways 
 Dollar signs, attitudes, dog in a real way 
 Condos to sky scrapers with my name on it 
 Desk, big C-E-O, rider from the Black Tek 
 If it wasn't for Dave, lookin' out 
 Your nigga Johnny, be on the corner lookin' burnt out 
 That's what it pays to appreciate thangs 
 Put a nigga in position to change the whole game
