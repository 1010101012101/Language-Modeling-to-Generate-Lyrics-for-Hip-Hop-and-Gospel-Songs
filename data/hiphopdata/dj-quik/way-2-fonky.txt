(DJ Quik) 
 Oh yes I'm new and improved, and to a funky-ass groove 
 My name is Quik and I'm smooth, and I'm makin' yo' ugly bitch move 
 With the streets you can't lose, but if you still wanna choose 
 To be a sucka, I got a 380 punk, so duck her 
 And to you motherfuckers thinkin' you wanna fade me? 
 I'm runnin' the underground, so fool, you're crazy 
 And you better step, 'fore I beat you with a switch 
 And tie you up, and make you watch, while I'm fuckin' yo' bitch 
 'Cause I'm a low-pro nigga that you should not fol-low 
 Puttin' suckaz in the wind cause my voice is hol-low 
 Put the pistol to your grill and your punk ass rolls 
 You grab my shit and I pull the trigger now you're missin' a nose 
 And umm, I don't fear your crew because my back is got 
 Chasin nothin' but the suckaz when we hit yo' spot 
 Yeah, straight Bronx killa, mark ass niggaz can't check me 
 But gotta respect me, 'cause I'm Way 2 Fonky
