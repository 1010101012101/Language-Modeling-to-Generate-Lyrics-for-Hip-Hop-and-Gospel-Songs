[Guy 1]-Ay, ay ?? 
 [Guy 2]-Ay man, what is it man? 
 [G1]-Who own the record man? 
 [G2]-Man, who the hell are you man? Walkin' up on me lookin' like you so 
 Broke, man, if it cost three cents to shit you'd have to throw up. You know 
 Who own the record. Man, why don't you sit your ignorant ass down, man, and 
 Listen. 
 [Playa Hamm] (DJ Quik) 
 So is it my turn again? (Yeah nigga it's yours) 
 Oh I done kick a funky verse for the P-funk? (Of course) 
 Well count down nigga to end for these fakers 
 Bet we hit this time and we fade no takers 
 Who thought the funk was despondent out the Westside 
 Not be along for the ride (But it's only for the trees) 
 That's right, so peep the shot 
 And if I get it hot, baby I'ma rock the twat 
 'Cause ain't no party like a party in the Penthouse suite 
 And you know how we do it, baby, yo Tree 
 So if the mack of the smack brings fear 
 Them perpetrators right when they was cowards right from the very start 
 Pretendin theys the ones that true 
 But pimp who is they foolin? (Not me or you) 
 Fools confused, thinking we's on a decline 
 'Cause we kicks the P's and tell 'em about the funk this time 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk

 (2-Tone) 
 Comin' at that ass again it don't stop 
 Bust a lean in yo 64 shift, take a hop to the top 
 Where the hustlas hang out 
 Endo remains to sprout; ?? knows what I'm talking about 
 And gets host from my block to your neighborhood 
 Tell 'em Quik when you know it's back to no good 
 I wish you would, 'cause I'm true to this gangsta shit 
 Now take a Tic Tac, and bust 'em like a hoe in the hood, bitch 
 Took my endz ho 
 They say it's never enough you know? 
 I gots to have mo' 
 But I'ma shake the spot infact 
 I just jacked his trick and his fo' so I can crack-a-lack 
 And straight P-funk anytime 
 It's only right you peeped the rhyme, I got to take mine 
 Check yo ass with the shit that stank 
 'Cause 2-Tone came to the game, ain't a damn thang changed 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 (Kam) 
 It's the 1 to the 9 with the 9 to the 4 
 When I thought you knew the drill, but you still don't hear me though 
 Kam and Watts up, from the grass roots 
 No daisy duke shit, knockin' crazy ass boots 
 Nigga please, we kick it like G'z 
 Puttin' down work when I lurk don't even sneeze (Fuck the Goldies) 
 That's just the Eastside way of getting chips 
 When your raise up chillin' with the dogs and the rips 
 New cars get tagged, ridas get wrecked 
 Niggas caps get peeled back, and chins get checked 
 Don't expect no love, boy, no apology 
 Kids ain't fallin' for yo child psychology 
 In 9 and 4 mindin yo business is the best bitch 
 Screamin 'Watts riot' we ain't even made a mess yet 
 Ya shouldn't speak with a weak heart 
 You gots to finish everything you start 
 And ain't a damn thang changed 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 (Hi-C) 
 Now niggas transform like deceptive cons 
 We'll slice your ass up like Jeffrey Don 
 Quik drop bombs on the P-funk tip 
 Even though a nigga rap you'll still get that ass whipped 
 Please don't slip, ain't a damn than changed 
 Numb yo ass up like some nova cane 
 Have you all fucked up like you smoked some loot 
 Hi-C still sippin pussy like soup 
 We got Kam, Hamm, New D, and Quik 
 And me myself, mista big dick 
 No I might not know which bitch that I want 
 But I know on thing I *scratch* <Got to have the funk> 
 From ya speaker and not from ya ass 
 'Cause some of y'all bitches just wont take baths 
 Hand picked niggas just can't me tang 
 'Cause we true to the game 
 And ain't a damn thang changed 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk 
 *Scratches* Nothing has changed, 
 Nothing has *scratches* gots to have the funk
