Yeah 
 I rough voco, for my locos. 
 My nigga Hi-C, 2nd II None, AMG 
 And the Q-U the new 
 You knew 
 I (?) to any particular groove 
 I came ok now 
 Check it if you want to but it's all in vein 
 Because me game is stil the same 
 Perfection! 
 Fill me as I fill you in 
 I never rode a pony but I'm genuine 
 So give me just a little bit of nicotine 
 And a sticky greeen 
 And I'm a hit it with the icky cream 
 Booyah I hit her on the neck with a whip 
 And made the hooker jump without a safety net 
 Hit the ground break her back 
 Get up and do it again because she can really take a shot on the chin 
 Caffeine cappucino chase it with some no-doz 
 Up all night like the moon glows 
 Searching for new hoes 
 They really want to follow my lead 
 Indeed and give a nigga just what I need 
 When I'm on speed 
 I'm faster then most 
 And I can rock a party from coast to coast 
 The Q-U-I-K is the name I spell 
 124 beats per minute I rock well 
 Because I'm tight to the second power 
 When I hit the liquor 
 And I don't serve emcees 
 I'm serve dickas 
 Bang bang boogie 
 When I hit a shot of loogie 
 And the Booger try to put it on me 
 But I get that moves to show her 
 I flaunt it like Noah 
 I strut backside like a Boa 
 Constrictor when I dicked her down 
 Game feel just like a circus clown when I work this 
 Jack of all trades 
 Master to few 
 Test these test these 1, 2 
 Gettin' down with my nigga AM to the G in the PM 
 Hookers wanna see him 
 Big cat callin 
 Superfat ballin 
 Indeed 
 Give us what we need 
 When I'm on speed 
 Faster then the concord 
 On board 
 Call me the pilot 
 Baby better let me know she's excited 
 In the testerosa 
 Sipppin memosas 
 Girls want me to sign posters 
 International with the steelo 
 Got hookers from Cancoun to Reo 
 Fire (?ignite it?) 
 But we don't even try it 
 You can't but it 
 Got freaks have to hide it 
 Hit the weed up 
 Then turn the speed up 
 The booty from the backs the only way I eat up 
 Quicker than Jackie Chan 
 I search off the Goochi like a rubber band 
 You want to be more than the average man 
 But the hoe needs more a job in a man 
 And a retirement plan 
 So baby don't cry the blues 
 'Cause I know a gang of hoes in your shoes 
 La da la da da da (till fade)
