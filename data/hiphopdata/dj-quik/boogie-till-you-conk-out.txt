All the ladies in the house, all the ladies in the house 
 Good morning 
 To all the ladies in the house, to all the ladies in the house 
 Good afternoon 
 To all the ladies in the house, to all the ladies in the house 
 Good evening 
 All the ladies in the house, to all the ladies in the house 
 Good Lord 
 To all the ladies in the place with class and taste 
 Allow me to place my hand on your waist 
 So we can boogie till you conk out, faint like Marie 
 On the dance floor boppin' with me 
 What? 
 To all the ladies in the place with style and taste 
 Allow me to place my hand on your waist 
 So we can boogie till you conk out, faint like Marie 
 On the dance floor boppin' with me 
 Now I'm not barely Alvin Ailey 
 But I make fly dance music daily 
 I may never dance to ballet in the valet 
 But you just might see me two step in the Valley 
 If that's a real expensive car in the alley then it might be me 
 Playin' hookey from your local TV 
 'Cause I'm flyer than a EB 
 The extraterrestrial biological entity with Elliot but you call him ET 
 Now let's get your BMX ready, let's ride it out 
 Let's do me like Drew Barrymore and let's hivey out 
 Give me a phone to call home, let's dial it out 
 That could cost 321 million dollars a minute 
 Now why wait, why not just call me Grey? 
 Why not just call me Blake? 
 I spend enough time on the airplane 
 Why not call me Frey, why not call me late? 
 Now 
 To all the ladies in the place with class and taste 
 Allow me to place my hand on your waist 
 So we can boogie till you conk out, faint like Marie 
 On the dance floor boppin' with me 
 What? 
 To all the ladies in the place with style and taste 
 Allow me to place my hand on your waist 
 So we can boogie till you conk out, faint like Marie 
 On the dance floor boppin' with me 
 What? 
 To all the latest, to all the latest 
 From the A-test up in Vegas 
 To all the latest from the nineties 
 You can find me where ever I be 
 I'm still gonna flow 2010 
 Still got about two thousand to spend 
 Haters in the place can't erase my grand 
 Stuck on my face when I'm with my friends 
 When I bust a rap to a DJ Quik beat 
 We get green just like Bill Bixby 
 Turn into a beast and you a beauty 
 No, I'm a player, will you recruit me? 
 I got game and you got to tailgate 
 Let's have a party, girl, why the hell wait? 
 Let's have a ball, get up from the table 
 If she don't wanna dance, find one and say 
 To all the ladies in the place with class and taste 
 Allow me to place my hand on your waist 
 So we can boogie till you conk out, faint like Marie 
 On the dance floor boppin' with me 
 What? 
 To all the ladies in the place with style and taste 
 Allow me to place my hand on your waist 
 So we can boogie till you conk out, faint like Marie 
 On the dance floor boppin' with me 
 Now what? 
 Ice Cube, DJ Quik, it's DJ Quik and Ice Cube 
 20 years in the making, a whole generation, ain't no faking 
 What up, homie? What up Triple Threat? 
 You a genius, no, you a genius 
 I'm a genius, yeah, I'm a genius 
 They ain't never ever seen this
