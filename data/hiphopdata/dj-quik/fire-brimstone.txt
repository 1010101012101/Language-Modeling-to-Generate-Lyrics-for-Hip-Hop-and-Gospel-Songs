You're going to like this 
 I don't give a fuck about you, you, her, him 
 That bitch, that nigga, y'all, them 
 Pussy clot laws bleeding out y'all trim 
 'Bout to fill ya cup up to the rim with brimstone 
 Fuck yo Grammy 
 Stick the bell part up ya ass, call ya mammy 
 I don't need ya love, muthafucka, god damn he 
 Critics wanna slam me 
 Put me in a jam 'til I come back with the jammy 
 Blaow 
 Knock your whole car window out 
 'Til ya eyes white out, bitch, lights out 
 Got you dead on arrival 
 At your service on Saturday, your whole family carry bibles 
 I got the whole building nervous 
 They turn around and see me walk up in the service 
 I wrote your eulogy on toilet paper, right out in the rain 
 Niggas got nerve, well, I'm your Novocain 
 Uh 
 This is fire and brimstone, uh 
 Kill you with fire and brimstone, uh 
 This is fire and brimstone, uh 
 Hold up 
 I'm a Mercedes man, a late 80's man 
 I guess you could call me the perennial ladies man 
 Got some really rich friends 
 And they all really like me 'cause I really pitch trims 
 Sometimes when I'm bored I kick it with dumb folk 
 They all really hate me like rottening egg yolks 
 I love to rub it in because I'm not a proper fit 
 For your world of bullshit 
 You miserable mutt minds flawed by design 
 You'll never have the temperament 
 To experiment with the benevolent 
 You're irrelevant 
 It should be your job to shovel shit 
 You need to cultivate and develop it 
 Get in the manure business and sell of it 
 Good luck, trick 
 I'm a precious stone wrapped in parchment paper 
 Round brilliant cut shootin' Meister Jager 
 A dignitary, you're a lowly beggar 
 Why don't you pull your plug, you stupid nigga? 
 This is fire and brimstone, uh 
 This is fire and brimstone, uh 
 This is fire and brimstone, ow 
 If your steering wheel is not wrapped in wood 
 Then you don't have the touch 
 So you will never feel it 'cause you denigrate too much 
 Who are you to judge, who are you to critique? 
 Who are you to falsify my presence? I am unique 
 So you can keep your 20 dollars 
 You ain't gotta buy my CD, muthafucka, not a problem 
 That's why I'm a recluse, not the one you set loose 
 Muthafuckas in this game, use my name to get juice 
 Say it, David Blake, a maven, amazing 
 Brighter than the forest when it's blazing 
 Asteroid, past the void, keep it pushing, that a boy 
 Gotta get it hotter than oven cooking, that's a joy 
 For these last four bars I take it easy 
 But you still a muthafucka and you're cheesy 
 Don't trust your memory 
 Write down what you feel about me 
 If yo head ain't rocking back and and forth then doubt me 
 Uh 
 This is fire and brimstone, uh 
 I give you fire and brimstone, uh 
 This is fire and brimstone, uh 
 You can drink that from the bottle of hair dye, yum 
 Sulfur 8 in your mouth like yum 
 Sulfur 8 in your mouth
