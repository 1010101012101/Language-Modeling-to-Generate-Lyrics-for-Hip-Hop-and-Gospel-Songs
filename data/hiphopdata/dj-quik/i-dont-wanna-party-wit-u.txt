Get back before I get raised, get lower 
 Do some extreme shit, keep from bein bored 
 Now it's double up, hoes come a nickel a dozen 
 They get hot and get fucked and don't remember from buzzin 
 That's why you don't see me, I ain't at the club 
 I'm chillin' with my homies in the city of hugs 
 Because they need me more than that hoe (that hoe), the big fat hoe 
 Tryna' get every ballin nigga in the saddle 
 Lap dance, fat chance, hot pants, you the man 
 Now a days you can't tell, watch the crotch, it might swell 
 You needs a pap smear 
 You need to know if you got an STD, 
 Some little critters in ya trap dear 
 Get on, me and my homies is indivisible 
 And don't floss money, it looks better when it's invisible 
 We get props from Wall Street to y'all street 
 If ya missed it, I stay consistent, we got heat 
 C-P-T style, O-G me style, the D-J Q-U-I-K with no C style 
 In yo' town, don't trip nigga, it goes down 
 And when you see me in all blue, you gon' frown 
 But I'm rigid the ghetto, I'm rigid with rap 
 Money or respect bitch, I'd rather have the digits than DAT 
 So give me the hats, do you want the meat or the scraps? 
 Put heat on my naps and I'ma hell look sweet on my lap 
 'Cause it's the same thang tryna' kill the gang bang 
 Set examples for the kids, on how to maintain 
 Never be a lame brain 
 Y'all ain't gotta feel the same pain 
 That put a nigga like me on the mainframe 
 Bow down, back up nigga, I'm hot now 
 And don't try to resuscitate me when I'm shot down 
 Just call my homie Theo on the radio 
 And let him know his little homie Quiksta had to go 
 Because 'Gangsta, Gangsta', that's what they yellin' 
 But niggas do dirt, get caught, and start tellin' 
 Talkin' to you G's with no heart 
 We was throwin' and runnin' from bullets 
 Before gangsta rappin' was an art 
 Nigga (nigga), so don't test ya bullet-proof vest 
 'Cause real niggas do real thangs up under stress 
 That's from the C-P-T, young G with heart, too 
 Oh we still party, but now it's part II 
 And 
 (I don't wanna party wit you) 
 Hell naw 
 'Cause bitch you scary 
 You 20 years old, with 3 kids, 7 tattoos, 
 You're bald but your legs are hairy 
 (I don't wanna party wit you) 
 Hmm, hell naw 
 You need to put some lotion on 
 'Cause ya skin is peelin around them bullet wounds on ya back 
 You're fat plus you're abortion-prone 
 I'd rather be a young exec, than the puppet on the other end 
 Danglin by a neuce on his neck 
 They can't handle me, 'cause I'm where the --- be 
 And underground nigga on Erickston, now there is the family 
 That I'ma roll wit, take control wit 
 Have a ball, break bread, and share the store wit 
 Even though I'm thirsty for money in the worst way 
 I ain't go cry if I don't go platinum on the first day 
 Watch me, get my hustle on with the friendly competition 
 Y'all got papers but I got the latest tradition 
 A hundred-thousand dollars a truck, is what I crack 
 And if you ain't got that, keep wishin 
 And to you bitch-ass niggas in the maze 
 Comin' at a player with --- ways 
 Keep lickin' on that other sound 
 And stay north of the 105 Hip Hop heads, 'cause this is underground 
 Right by the water, can't do right by ya daughter 
 But look at all the shit that I done bought her 
 See lyrics ain't nothin' if the beat ain't crackin' 
 And these beats smackin, that's why the G's keep stackin, nigga 
 (I don't wanna party wit you) 
 Hell naw 
 'Cause nigga you's a scuffla 
 Your braids is dingy, your clothes ain't got no creases 
 And your lips look like you sucked a muffler 
 (I don't wanna party wit you) 
 Hell naw 
 'Cause bitch you didn't know me when you was fine as wine and thick 
 Now you sick from smokin' that shit, you're broke and plus you're boney 
 W-E-S-T, C-O-A-S-T, that's where the hydroponic with no seeds be 
 So don't trip when you see me on the TV, or my CD 
 And my eyes are really R-E-D 
 See the --- is free (shh shh shh), pardon me for bein speaky 
 Switchin on y'all that wanna jeek me 
 What makes you even try that way? 
 Yeah I might be fly, but I don't fly that way 
 Hmm, even on a gallon a Sisco I could never go disco 
 Dude I ain't from Frisco 
 And to these bitches, y'all trippin', we ain't layin wit y'all 
 Just because we say we wanna fuck, we playin' wit y'all 
 This is entertainment, we tryna' make us some change 
 We ain't impressed by what you got up under your Hanes 
 Bitch that's yo' trap, and that's yo' sap 
 Let me spit the cap while she sit in yo' lap 
 Homie, don't you know me 
 Jealous-ass niggas wanna flow me (why) 
 Just because yo' woman wanna blow me 
 On the strength I give that hoe a tittie-toy 
 'Cause I'm the only ugly nigga gettin' away with bein pretty boy 
 (I don't wanna party wit you) 
 Hmm, hell naw 
 Now this is how the sporty bounce 
 We stay away from you broke-ass niggas 
 Always beggin and ain't got a dime on the 40 oz 
 (I don't wanna party wit you) 
 Hmm, hell naw 
 'Cause hoe you toe-back, with that ol' long ass roll 
 And ya stockin smellin like Avon and that horse want his 'fro back 
 (I don't wanna party wit you) 
 Hmm, hell naw 
 And nigga I can't stand ya 
 And I ain't got nothin' but some advice, 
 A map, a bar of soap, some water and a towel to hand ya 
 (I don't wanna party wit you) 
 Hmm, hell naw 
 Now I'ma be real wit it 
 All my fuckin' life I ain't never wanted fame 
 But since the shit done came I gotta deal wit it 
 (I don't wanna party wit you) 
 Ya know, but I'ma do it like my homie say 
 Check it, I don't give a fuck about fame 
 I'd rather deal with the money, y'all can have the name 
 I'm out 
 Yeah
