What I'm drankin' on Looking for the love of my life, lil drank, lil stank 
 That's the love of my life, 
 Not looking for a hussy trying to be my wife, say I'm looking for the cash, that's the love of my life 
 I'm looking for the love, the love of my life, lil drank, lil stank that's the love of my life 
 Not looking for a broad trying to be my wife, say I'm looking for a whip, that's the love of my life 
 Now with a driver I can drink like I'm off the bottle 
 Martini glass filling, that's off the top 
 Don't like the talk shop, I'd rather shop and talk 
 I treat the tags like I treat them clubs, pop 'em off 
 A lot of players got the game distorted, if you have to ask how much it cost you can't afford it 
 Plain and simple cut and dry, right to the chase 
 Cause sometimes you gotta put them ig-ums in they place 
 Everybody can't make it to the pros, some rise to the top, others down low 
 Some ride in the drops, others just drove, that's the way the water flows, if it ain't froze 
 Look at the brain on the man quick as the dame get the game from my mind to the pin through my hand 
 And to the streets from the speakers to the mike, that's why I'm so materialistic 
 I'm tryna buy the luv right 
 I'm looking for the love of my life, lil drank, lil stank 
 That's the love of my life, 
 Not looking for a hussy trying to be my wife, say I'm looking for the cash, that's the love of my life 
 I'm looking for the love, the love of my life, lil drank, lil stank 
 That's the love of my life 
 Not looking for a broad trying to be my wife, say I'm looking for a whip, that's the love of my life 
 Panamera Porsche, Maserati copy painting, diamonds from Chris Aire 
 Too awesome ain't it 
 Middle finger in the air for the disses, and Tiffany jewelry for the misses 
 Orange bottle champagne tilt green blue, clicko and Dom Perignon we too 
 Turn the music up so loud it bleed through, the bang out that's exactly what he do 
 He get his style from the city of Compton fuck the doorbell, he get to knocking on something 
 Whip out on these haters get the blocking on something 
 Take my girl home and get to locking on something or something 
 Yeah, that's my ghetto mentality, I made it reality and it made me a salary 
 So I know just why you haters are mad at me 
 My life is a strategy, while your life is a tragedy, that's why I'm looking 
 Looking for the love of my life, lil drank, little lil stank 
 That's the love of my life, 
 Not looking for a hussy trying to be my wife, say I'm looking for the cash, that's the love of my life 
 I'm looking for the love, the love of my life, lil drank, lil stank 
 That's the love of my life, 
 Not looking for a broad trying to be my wife, say I'm looking for a whip, that's the love of my life 
 I'm looking for the new love of my life, bein CL6 skin all tan and with the insides 
 Color of beach sand, it's such a beautiful sight, just like Amber Rose the way she sits at the light 
 Hit a pose I let her pause for the cause, camera shows, 50k watch just so the... go 
 Jury go bananas so they go apes I'm making love to the money like a sex tape 
 I travel onward, on to the next state, makin' that big cake but no wedding day 
 I'm so hood rich, and luv to cash out and tear malls down 
 Yeah, spaze out and throw it in the bags and bring bags out 
 Full throttle whips, yeah smash out, newest space for my house got another house 
 I gotta make money 
 Looking for the love of my life, lil drank, lil stank 
 That's the love of my life, 
 Not looking for a hussy trying to be my wife, say I'm looking for the cash, that's the love of my life 
 I'm looking for the love, the love of my life, little drank, little spank 
 That's the love of my life 
 Not looking for a broad trying to be my wife, say I'm looking for a whip, that's the love of my life.
