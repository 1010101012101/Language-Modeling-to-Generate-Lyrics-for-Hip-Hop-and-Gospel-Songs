Here we go 
 Yo, a day in the life of a player named Quik 
 I'm just a stubborn kinda fella with a head like a brick 
 And just because I drink the 8, they say that I'm hopeless 
 But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the locals 
 Now this is how we do it when we checkin a grip 
 Teddy Bear's in the house, so don't even trip 
 We're bustin funky compositions as smooth as a prism 
 So check it while I kick it to this funky ass rhythm 
 It's Friday mornin, the phone is ringin off the hook 
 And AMG is in the den reviewin rhymes in his notebook 
 Or should I say dope sack, because we don't bust wack 
 I pick up the phone and it's the D (whassup nigga?) 
 He said he's comin down at about two on the dot 
 So I'm about to rush the tub while my water's still hot 
 And now I'm soakin, a brother like the devestatin DJ Quik ain't jokin 
 Fuck with me on DSP and you'll get broken 
 My name is Quik, but you can call me Daddy 
 Yo open up the door, they think I'm Freak Man in a Caddy 
 Now Freaky's in the El-Dog and Shabby's in the ElCo 
 And everybody's sippin on a quart (here we go) 
 D just came with a forty and a quart 
 In addition to the three that Greedy just bought 
 But I don't wanna start early, so I just might 
 Put my forty in the freezer 'cause I wanna get bent 
 Tonight is the night (yeah) 
 Tonight is the night 
 Tonight is the night (yo when we gon get bent) 
 Tonight is the night (aww yeah) 
 And now I'm outta the tub, I'm feelin fancy free 
 Spray on some Xeryus and put on my Givenchy sweatsuit 
 The gray one with the burgundy trim 
 And it's a medium, fit me proper 'cause I'm nice and slim 
 Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin 
 And I'm steadily thinkin about the 8 that I'll be drinkin 
 You know I ain't ashamed and you know I ain't bashful 
 So go on and pop the forty so I can pour me a glassful 
 Hamm is in the bedroom rollin up a stencil 
 Fatter than a pinky and the length of a pencil 
 Freaky lit it up and hit it one, two, three 
 Shabby took a hit and then they pass it to me (it's the bomb) 
 Yo, I can feel my senses (gettin numb) 
 Yo, fuck the forty ounce (I need some rum) 
 I'm chillin like a villain (here I come) 
 And that's how I'm livin 
 Tonight is the night and I'm lookin real sporty 
 Proper Friday evening and I'm ready to party 
 Crusher came in with a handfulla snaps 
 Fuck it, let's shoot some craps 
 (Yo what they in fo') A fin or a half 
 (Yo shoot that ten, nigga) Don't make me laugh 
 Hi-C won a dub and he think that shit is funny 
 But I'm seven and eleven, and I'm takin niggaz money 
 Tonight is the night (yeah watch me bust a hoe) 
 Tonight is the night (passin naturals on motherfuckers) 
 Tonight is the night (yo, I'm unfadeable) 
 Tonight is the night (ah, let's break it down so I can get funky) 
 Aww yeah 
 Givin em somethin they can roll on 
 Hold on 
 Wake up Saturday mornin and I got a headache 
 I can't believe that I'm sick from all the shit that I drank 
 (Last night) Soon as I felt it comin on 
 I shoulda quit, it's true that a drunk ain't shit 
 To the man up above, to whom thanks I give 
 I'll never drink again if you just let me live 
 Mike P spoke to me and I said I couldn't call it 
 Call it Earl like a mother while I'm grippin the toilet 
 I need a 7-Up, because my head is spinnin 
 Round and round I think I better sit down 
 My homey Shot is alright, but I'm feelin faint 
 I guess he's used to it, but a nigga like Quik ain't 
 K is on the phone and Teddy's at the door 
 And some fine ass bitches comin over at four 
 (I thought you weren't drinkin no more) Yeah right 
 Because as soon as they come, we doin the same ol shit tonight 
 Tonight is the night (yeah) 
 Tonight is the night (straight gettin fucked up, hey) 
 Tonight is the night (fuck that pass me that pi√±a colada man, I don't wanna fade that 8 Ball no mo) 
 Tonight is the night (that shit be fuckin a nigga up, heh) 
 Tonight is the night (aww yeah, standin by the party and I'm kickin it) 
 Tonight is the night (sup Greedy Greg, how ya livin?) 
 Tonight is the night (hey somebody, get that nigga a Genuine Draft, yeah) 
 Tonight is the night (and on that motherfuckin note, I'm outta here, see-ya) 
 We out (what about peace?) 
 Fuck peace nigga, gimme another brew
