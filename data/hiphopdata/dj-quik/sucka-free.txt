 (Sucka) 
 (Sucka) 
 (Suc ka) 
 (Ha?) 
 (Now a sucka raises up off of you) 
 Did you miss me? 
 It took a little time to get sucka-free 
 But since a young g it's ppc 
 Ain't no shame in the name 
 And still true to the game 
 Still servin' suckers, just the same 
 No sense, and dwellin in the past tense 
 I roll with quik, so you better check your ladies, gents 
 'Cause I'ma teach her how to break you, right before I break her 
 After I make her, then I shake her 
 Yeah, I know, you heard it all before 
 But I can't deal, 'cause I see you're still simpin for a hoe 
 Claimin pimp, but you're payin' for the pu' 
 Silly sucker, punk muthafucka 
 They only flock and jock 
 'Cause you're fillin up they pocketbooks 
 And you're still judgin bitches by they looks 
 When it's really all about what she can do for you 
 I do for me and still see a true 
 Ah-ha, really? do you hear me, bro? 
 Got your name all on your lips, but your chick trips 
 Oh no, never will I lower to your level 
 And I got 17 for ya, devil 
 Too true to ever let a sucker like you 
 Make me do somethin' that I don't wanna do 
 I'm still real with it, you gots to deal with it 
 I serve that ass like a clocker, I don't give a fuck 
 But who you're doin', how you're doin' 
 Or what you do it with 
 You better miss me with the dumb shit 
 So when you're speakin' on the playa hamm or my nigga quik 
 Everybody knows you're suckin on a fat dick 
 It ain't nothin' to nuttin in your ass, so that you see clear 
 Boomin in your ear, so I know you hear 
 Bump this in your coupe with your r&b wanna-be-me 
 Trick-ass, I'm sucka-free
