(DJ quik) 
 And just when you motherfuckers thought it was over 
 I'm back up in this motherfucker... 
 "You better get ready" 
 "For-for-for for America's most complete artist" 
 "What's your name boy? " 
 "I... am.." "America's most complete artist" 
 "You better get ready" 
 "For America's most complete artist" 
 [Quik] doin' much damage in the ninety-two 
 "For America's mo-mo-mo-mo 
 Most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist" 
 (DJ quik) 
 Now DJ quik is the nigga that's comin' up real thick 
 I'm a stone funkaholic yet I don't need schick 
 Because there ain't another nigga more versatile 
 DJ quik been bustin' funky rhythms all the while 
 And this song is for the homies who was down with me 
 When I was broke as a joke, flat with no mon-ey 
 And to them doubtin-ass motherfuckers, 'cause they don't know yeah 
 Instead of showin and provin yo I'm provin that I'm the show 
 Now who wants to fade this modern day prophet? 
 Take two steps forward, one shell and you droppin' 
 Because I don't go toe to toe, I go hoe to hoe 
 Yo' hoe is so-so, so yo, I think I better let her go 
 'Cause she ain't worth my time 
 And before I get off into another rhyme 
 I'ma bring this verse to a climax, grab the axe 
 Open the door, clear the floor, and make way 
 "For America's most complete artist" 
 "What's your name boy? " 
 "I... am.." "America's most complete artist" 
 [Quik] sucker ass niggaz can't fade me 
 "For America's most complete artist" 
 "Quik.." "what kind of name is that for a nigga? " 
 "For America's mo-mo-mo-mo 
 Most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist" 
 (DJ quik) 
 Now when I say I'm complete; 
 That means I'm true to my game and my cap 
 And I refrain from bein played like a sap 
 And a bitch? no bitch can handle what I'm kickin 
 They say I'm trippin' but they stick around my room for a dickin 
 Cause the power of the quiksta's too overwhelmin 
 And when you let me rip I'm goin' in with a helmet 
 That's why your little brother wants to be like me 
 I'm surrounded by the trueness that suckers fail to see 
 Now 2nd ii none, is you down with the quik? "what you think? " 
 Mr. bankin, is you down with the quik? "yeah, you know it" 
 Playa hamm, is you down with the quik? "oh but of course playa" 
 And everybody else... {".. can get the dick"} 
 Now on my last album, I said I rolled too motherfuckin deep 
 That was for them suckaz that was tryin' to creep 
 But peep the real - that when I got that murderin feelin' 
 I can take a loss and make a killin' and still be 
 "America's most complete artist" 
 [Quik] fuck these punk ass niggaz! 
 "You-you-you better get ready" 
 "For America's most complete artist" 
 "For America's most complete artist" 
 [Quik] doin' much damage c-p-t style 
 "For America's mo-mo-mo-mo 
 Most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist" 
 [Quik] yo fuck the bridge 
 I better take y'all into the canal, kick it 
 Mo pussy, mo pussy, mo pussy... 
 (DJ quik) 
 Damn! that's how a nigga like me is 
 True to it, ain't fakin for the showbiz 
 All the true ass niggaz, yup ya know this 
 But the others jock jockin me like they hoe is 
 Cause DJ quik can be as funky as the douche 
 Shoot stutter steppin with pep but still I manage to givin' the suckaz 
 The boot if they ask for it, because they know I flow it 
 Need I say more? "no!" well that's it 
 "For America's most complete artist" 
 "You better get ready" 
 "For America's most complete artist" 
 "What's your name boy? " 
 "I... am.." "America's most complete artist" 
 "You better get ready" 
 "For America's mo-mo-mo-mo 
 Most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist"
