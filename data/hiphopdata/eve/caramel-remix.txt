(Verse 1: Claudette Ortiz) 
 Uh-huh, come on 
 You can say I'm plain jane, but it's not the same 
 I ain't into big names, but I like nice things 
 I watch boxin' matches and football games 
 I wouldn't mind being an actress, but I love to sing 
 I like goin' out, takin' walks and stuff 
 I don't run with many girls 'cause they talk too much 
 I enjoy quiet nights at home curled up next to ya 
 You know I ain't a virgin that don't mean I'm havin' sex with ya 
 (Chorus: Claudette) 
 Anywhere I go I'm spotted (No doubt) 
 And anything I want I got it (Yeah) 
 5'5" with brown eyes (Caramel complexion) 
 Smile like the sunrise (Body Like Heaven) 
 'Cause anywhere I go I'm spotted (No doubt) 
 And anything I want I got it (Yeah) 
 5'5" with brown eyes (Caramel complexion) 
 Smile like the sunrise (Body Like Heaven) 
 (Verse 2: Claudette) 
 Baby look me in the eyes and tell me if 
 I'm the kind of girl you like, I'm feelin' you 
 'Cause baby you're my kind of guy, that's what it is 
 Think about it you just might wanna run with this 
 All night long and if you want me we can keep this going 
 But let me tell you I'm the type that's strong 
 And I don't trust a lot of men, I'm independent 
 I ain't like some other women 
 (Verse 3: Eve) 
 I keep 'em mesmorized, listen to me closely 
 E-V-E is how a thorough bred supposed to be 
 Hate the thirsty type, can't even get close to me 
 That's why I got my own stack, Daddy, how it's supposed to be 
 I ain't about the game playin', and gift chasin' 
 All in frontin' Daddy Please we both big facin' 
 All the things I want, I got, forget me not 
 Just from my stance, why you starin' at me? Got'chu hot 
 Not too many bitches like her, one of a kind 
 I mean even the bitches like her, she just a dime 
 Not impressed by your Cris' poppin' 
 'Cause if you would, I might, end of the night, we gone be lip locking 
 But only if I choose to, I don't fall in love easily 
 Give'you the blues Boo 
 I have you sittin' 'round misty-eyed 
 Caramel, get 'em all the time 
 Hot shit from City High
