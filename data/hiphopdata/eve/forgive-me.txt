Forgive me, I'm too sexy in the morning time 
 Talkin' bout he gotta go, but he wanna stay and grind 
 Forgive me, I'm too sexy in the morning time 
 Knowing that he gotta go, but he wanna stay and grind 
 I'm sorry for being so fly 
 I didn't mean to row by 
 And catch of the eye that you got 
 You know I keep 'em up like coke and bakin soda 
 That's why I'm takin' over 
 His mom but she can't get I'm off the sofa 
 Plus I'm the closest thing over 
 Billionaire shit, plus I got that fire chocha, that's no lie 
 I put my number in his Motorola, and since then it's been over 
 So apologies in order 
 I'm just hopin you... 
 I'm wonderin if I should tell him yes 
 I know his girl hittin on me but she better rest 
 I know she wishin that I cheer, I'mma let her sweat 
 'Cause now she study in my office like Belachick 
 I'm a victim of hard life, somebody gonna fizz 
 It cost a lot of bread just to get me out of bed 
 And I know that he be tryin' but he can't get me out his head 
 Killin' 'em is a crime but remember when I said to... 
 You know you sexy in the morning 
 You know what's right feels nice when it started 
 He never leave 'cause your body keep callin 
 Pick the squeeze but he can't stop stalling 
 (Again)
