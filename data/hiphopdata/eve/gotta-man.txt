I got a boyfriend now! Heehee 
 Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever 
 And forever, we'll be together (C'mon) 
 No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him 
 I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him 
 Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever 
 And forever, we'll be together (C'mon) 
 No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him 
 I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him 
 This nigga lookin' like love, no doubt 
 Sophisticated thug, keep me guessin' 
 Said it would be a blessin, jus to watch you undressin' 
 Callin' you daddy, late nights I'm layin on your chest 
 N state reminisin 'bout the rest 'n' how the less n 
 Tryin' to come between wat we share can't compair 
 Could have been left but but when its mine I neva share 
 Fite to the death if need be to prove that 
 Wounes from ur war other bitches couldn't sooth 
 That brock from a bad back I'm go be down 
 Throwin' bert with other bitches but the other fishes 
 Drownd like than 4 how ever long I'm playin' it small 
 More dates in toher cites damn I'm playin' 
 My part wify in ur life see for ever be us 
 Passenger side of a bentlee or the number to bust 
 Tell the whole wourld papi he don't want no budy ealz 
 With other nikkaz pick 'n' chooze but chu I'm keep 4 my self 
 Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever 
 And forever, we'll be together (C'mon) 
 No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him 
 I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him 
 I'm gonna love him 
 (2) 
 All my peoplz thinkin' I'm dalerious but the love I feel is serious 
 Couples of the world no comparen us been throuh feast 
 Fites with nikkaz when I see an escalade I'm the get away 
 Driver so my nikka can excape pull my ice 
 Hello where"s the rest of the damn song?
