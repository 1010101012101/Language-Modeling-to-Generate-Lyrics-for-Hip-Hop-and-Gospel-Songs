You and me should just let this go 
 We never did take the time to try to hold on 
 I'm thinking that you and me should just let this go 
 We never did take the time to try to hold on 
 I'm sicka that 
 Yeah it was hard breaking up ain't never easy believe me 
 But fuck that I wasn't getting treated like I needs be 
 But trust I was controlling all the things around me 
 Causw shit I've always been this chick ever since you found me 
 I tried and I tried 
 Cried and I cried 
 Down for you nigga with lie after lie after lie 
 Got sick of trading game with dudes 
 Started getting jealous of me like dames would do 
 I'm like dog check your balls mad 'cause I receive aplause 
 Living my life was against the law 
 Starting fights in public just so you can piss me off 
 I swear I was a dude it'd be fist to jaw 
 Always mad at my mouth 'cause I cursed you out 
 Listen hard know you feeling what these verses bout 
 Doing dumb shit breaking things hiding my phone 
 I'm outta this hear pimp?just leave me alone 
 He love girls girls yeah?well you lost the best 
 I had to get away I'm past the stress 
 Mama told me babygirl never settle for less 
 Learned the hard way hard days I'm ready for nest 
 A bunch of leaving I don't need E shit 
 I'm doing me soon as I pack you sitting there with the blues 
 You and me 
 Remenising 'bout the way you was pursuing me 
 Acting like your period on screaming you through with me 
 Well bye dog 
 Have a nice life I'm fine dog 
 Don't try to track me down or call cause that line off 
 Hope you feeling bad without me 
 See if you can last without me 
 Cry what tears I'm happy I'm free 
 Still riding past the spots that you know I go 
 Procrastinating with your niggas hopeing that I'll show 
 Never know what you have till it's gone (huh) 
 Wonder what she doin'? Best believe she doin' her (come on) 
 Funny how it happens when you fall in love 
 When you find out that the one you wit ain't who you want 
 Then you move out till you find yourself anotha love 
 But your ex gone always hate 'cause he can't hit you off 
 You don't hear me though 
 Claim you wanna please me. Yet you vex me 
 Can't front. Be thinkin' 'bout the way you used to sex me 
 God damn. Days short. Nights was long 
 And I was mad when I started spendin' nights alone 
 But I'm better off by myself lookin' for somethin' else 
 Sendin' me shit you can't pronounce. I don't want nothin' else 
 Wanted to love you until the end of my time 
 But fuck it. I'm done wit' you at the end of this line (uh-huh)
