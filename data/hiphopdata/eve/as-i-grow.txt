Turn your negative into a positive 
 This one is for the kids 
 People hear me when I talk to ya 
 As I grow 
 People try to break me 
 But I still stand strong 
 Cause this life that I'm livin' 
 It's all my own 
 And can't nobody take me off 
 This path I travel on 
 People hear me when I talk to ya 
 I'm in the position to help alotta people 
 When I'm lovin' 
 But people that claim they love me 
 Wanna take advantage of it 
 ???????Toss alotta lies 
 Can't trust a soul 
 You see the swellin in my eyes 
 Let my pen stab the page 
 Sometimes I feel rage sometimes I feel trapped 
 Got me locked in the cage 
 But I break free wont ever let the anger overtake me 
 'Cause actions of another never break me or make me 
 I never let 'em change me picoooooo 
 And no matter what I always wish success to those who hate me 
 The ones they call my enemies 
 Who really only wanna be friends with me 
 On the other hand surrounded by the greatest team 
 Wouldn't trade ma for nothing not for anything 
 Thank you for givin' me your best 
 And I appreciate givin' your everything and nothin' less 
 I live my life in a semi chest 
 My heart beats strong 
 Sometimes contaminated by the pest 
 And yeah I know I'm livin' blessed 
 And if I didn't make it here my life would be a mess 
 Can't live a life of fear 
 All that gets you is nowhere surrounded by a bunch of stress 
 And I always had a hard head 
 Had the choice to play around with life 
 Or listen to what god said 
 So I straigten up I'm doin' right 
 Growin' every year 
 Hey yo this thing ain't happen over night 
 But I still got a lot to do 
 And never givin' up 
 'Cause anything I feel I know its possible 
 Don't ever let people discourage 
 Plant your seed of dreams baby and let 'em flourish 
 Lettin you know what I know 
 As I live my life and as I grow 
 All we want you to know is... we love you eve
