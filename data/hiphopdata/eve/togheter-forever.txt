The moment I wake up 
 Before I put on my make-up 
 I say a little prayer for you 
 While caming my hear now 
 And wondering what dress to wear now 
 I say a little prayer for you 
 Forever and ever you'll stay in my heart 
 And I will love you forever and ever 
 We're never apart, oh how I love you 
 Together forever, that's how it must be 
 To live without you would only mean heartbreak for me 
 I run for the bus dear, 
 While riding I think of you dear 
 I say a little prayer for you 
 At work I just take time 
 And all through my coffee-breaktime 
 I say a little prayer for you 
 I'll say a little prayer for you (2x) 
 My darling believe me, for me there is no one but you 
 Please love me too 
 (Answer his prayer) 
 And I'm in love with you 
 (Answer his prayer now baby) 
 And answer my prayer, babe 
 (Answer his prayer)
