(Eve) They usually hate her when she comes around 
 Huh, first lady mobbin' nigga hit the ground 
 Next break into that who we what a sound 
 Heads boppin', never fails once the Doc's around 
 Hatin' the fact that she do things on both sides 
 But never disrespect two rings round both eyes, right? 
 Lady like in many ways because in trust I can be crazy like on any day 
 Some do they dirt but best believe in time they pay 
 Do believe in lettin shit chill till the promised day huh 
 Seems they just fade away I love it 'cause them clowns they just paved the way 
 Left it wide open got no time to play mad 'cause shit changed got no time to stay 
 Considered snobby then just hate me I don't give a fuck 
 Considered sloppy to me you just need to give it up... 
 (Styles) Eve don't give a fuck about you, that's what it is 
 Eve is the hottest bitch, that's what it is 
 But she gon' stay ladylike, that's what it is 
 But I'ma act crazy like, that's what it is 
 Think I got your house shot, that's what it is 
 Think I got your car burnt, that's what it is 
 Think I got your people robbed, that's what it is 
 'Cause we don't give a fuck about you, that's what it is 
 (Styles) I ain't got a moment to waste 
 I'm tryin' to get to your head, so I gotta make room in your face 
 And they can't see your eyes or your nose 
 Why P? 'Cause 4, 5 slugs is consumin' the space 
 This is Holiday you need, you fuck with the Scorpion 
 I don't stop poppin' till your body don't breathe 
 Clap more than the audience, after the show 
 Stab more than the butcher, and I'm kinda righteous 
 So I'ma help you pray for the Lord when I push ya 
 She the First Lady, I'm the ghost with the gun 
 Aimed at your son that'll love to burst crazy 
 Ruff Rydin' the clique, come up outta your shit 
 Get clapped in the wig, sold a lot of records 
 But we never gave a fuck so it's a wrap for the kids 
 Gat to the back and the ribs we the hood, even Holiday bitch that's what it is 
 (Eve) Broke out and got grown, holdin' her own 
 That bitch come strong, give up, dead wrong 
 I don't even fuck around 'less your head strong 
 Ain't too many that's around that can match they mind blown 
 Can't figure her out is she street, sweet, gutter, I'm from the hood 
 A lot of y'all niggas gold, this bitch two million sold 
 And I just figured that I'd make it known 
 Baby girl got the whole world in her palm, alone 
 Watch me rock, got my lip cocked 
 Spit fire, watch it better duck, you stuck, you crossfire 
 Thought you was the realest you said you caught liar 
 Any time you at where I be, I'ma try you
