You had me, You lost me 
 And now you want me back 
 You fucked around and played around 
 And now your feeling sad 
 How should I start it off 
 You must have thought me soft 
 Like it was all good to move on 
 And cross me off 
 We never shared secrets 
 We wasn't fuckin' raw 
 Helped you when you were down 
 And now I got the fuckin' door 
 We used be so tight 
 We was each others life 
 You was my husband 
 And no doubt I was you fuckin' wife 
 I did every thing you ever asked of eve 
 You turned out to be devil 
 Nigga I couldn't believe 
 Sneakin numbers off my phone 
 Callin bitches on the cell 
 What the hell clunky bitches 
 1 on the scale 
 I'm like a dime overline 
 You can't calculate my status 
 And you fucking with these bitches 
 Like my ass wasn't the phattest 
 Like I didn't dress baddest 
 Anytime it surfaced 
 Must of been insecure 
 Niggas made you nervous 
 And I guess it was your purpose to lock me in 
 But you fucked up your lucks out but then again 
 Used to let shit slide 
 Caught a couple lies 
 I chilled for real I mean I called a couple guys 
 Knewing you was fuckin' up I saw it in your eyes 
 And I guess it was my fault 
 'Cause I put up in disguise 
 In public we was happy 
 At home we'd be scrappin 
 Later we be naked 
 Jokin, Smokin' and Laughin' 
 Making up a break up 
 I thought that shit was love 
 But I guess I had to learn the hard way 
 Soaking in sobs 
 Crying all depress 
 Not again you'll never catch me 
 Wishin on some on some star 
 For some nigga to come bless me 
 I tried to save it 
 All you ever did is stress me 
 Pushing all my buttons 
 Why the fuck must you stress me 
 Nigga get a life go on and find a wife 
 Get the fuck out my face 
 Before I go and find a knife 
 And you still callin my phone 
 Trying to act polite 
 Askin me for favors 
 Now you know that shit ain't right 
 Ut oh 
 You see me coming don't you 
 Look at you runnin' won't you 
 Or you gone sit there 
 And see me like I won't approach you 
 Now its payback I'm talkin' way back 
 Them bitches callin hanging up 
 You ain't know what to say back 
 To unanswered questions 
 Home in the A.M 
 You out clubbing 
 Forcing me to stay in 
 Remember O.K then 
 It's over no playing 
 I said it before 
 I'm out the door 
 Fuck what you saying 
 To late for apologies 
 Go puff on a pile of weed 
 Think about this good bitch 
 Just leave and don't follow me 
 Movin on 
 Shut you down now you wanna regret 
 You can fuck all day 
 But It will never feel like my sex 
 Played yourself 
 Tried to show I cared 
 You ain't care 
 When I needed you the most nigga 
 You wasn't there 
 And the game is the same comes 
 Around goes around 
 Now hate me forever while the chorus goes around 
 Chorus times 2 
 Till end
