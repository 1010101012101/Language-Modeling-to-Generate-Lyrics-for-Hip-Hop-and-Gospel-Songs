 Shake your tambourine gon get yourself a whistlin [x15] 
 Missy elliott: 
 I'mma shake my tambourine 
 Keep it jumpin' like a trampoline 
 See the puddy cat 
 It look pretty fat 
 And tell them boys to come close watch me push him back 
 Us girls look cute shakin our stuff 
 Them boys standin back lookin' at us 
 Shakin shakin now 
 Let me break it down 
 When me and eve come through you better watch out 
 Shake your tambourine gon get yourself a whistlin 
 Shake your tambourine gon get yourself a whistlin 
 Shake your tambourine gon get yourself a whistlin 
 Shake your tambourine gon get yourself a whistlin 
 Shake your tambourine gon get yourself a whistlin 
 Fabolous: 
 (Jiggle it baby) 
 Go head baby

 If bitches take you there you betta go head baby

 And we can be cleaner then the post threads baby 
 Lean on these honies like a dopehead baby 
 The niggas on your car gets no bread baby 
 Do it say stupid on your phone call baby 
 Since I got what I made I ain't gotta check those bills

 Shake your tambourine gon get yourself a whistlin 
 Eve:

 Swizz beatz: 
 So clean so mean 
 Shawty on the floor shakin her damn tambourine 
 Get it on the floor show her pictures she ain't seen b4 
 Told her I could make her back it up on the wall 
 I told her I was freaky freaky freaky on the floor 
 She said I was skinny so she thought I coulnt hold her 
 But I threw her damn big ass on my shoulder 
 I told her 
 Shake your tambourine gon get yourself a whistlin
