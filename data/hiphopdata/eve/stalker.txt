I'm not allowed to see you, I'm not allowed to care 
 I'm not allowed to talk to you, to stop and look and stare 
 People say I'm crazy, people call me insane, 
 But I'm just another guy feeling love's great pain. 
 Diddly dum dum you're walking down the street 
 Lookin' really really pretty as your tapping your feet 
 Intime to the walkman attatched to your head 
 It's your fault that it's my heart that bled, 
 Talking to your friends on your telephone, 
 You hear some gossip and you sexily groan, 
 I'm walkin' behind you, intime to your feet, 
 Hearin' on your walkman that soft boom beat 
 I'm not allowed to see you, I'm not allowed to care 
 I'm not allowed to talk to you, to stop and look and stare 
 People say I'm crazy, people call me insane, 
 But I'm just another guy feeling love's great pain. 
 You turn around and see me there, 
 You pause a second, stop and stare 
 No retrainin' order can hold me back, 
 Nothing can get ME back on track 
 You raise the alarm by shouting for help 
 I grab you by the arm and you painfully yelp 
 I tell you I love you, you start to cry, 
 It hurts inside and I don't know why 
 I'm not allowed to see you, I'm not allowed to care 
 I'm not allowed to talk to you, to stop and look and stare 
 People say I'm crazy, people call me insane, 
 But I'm just another guy feeling love's great pain. 
 Why can't I see you, why can't I care? 
 Why can't a talk to you, why can't I stop and stare, 
 I swear I am not crazy, I'm far from insane, 
 I'm just another guy feeling loves great pain 
 You hate me, I love you, you fear me, I dare. 
 I just want to be held, I just want to care. 
 When you see me, you feel nought but dread, 
 My hearts drained of blood, its bled bled bled. 
 I'm not allowed to see you, I'm not allowed to care 
 I'm not allowed to talk to you, to stop and look and stare 
 People say I'm crazy, people call me insane, 
 But I'm just another guy feeling love's great pain.
