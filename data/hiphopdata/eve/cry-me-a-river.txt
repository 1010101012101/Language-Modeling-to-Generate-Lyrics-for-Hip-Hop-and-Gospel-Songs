You were my sun 
 You were my earth 
 But you didn't know all 
 The ways I loved you, no 
 So you took a chance, 
 And made other plans. 
 But I bet you didn't think 
 Ur thing would come 
 Crashing down, no 
 You don't have to say, 
 What you did 
 I already know, I found 
 Out from him 
 Now there's just no 
 Chance 
 For you and me, there'll 
 Never be 
 And don't make you 
 Sad about it 
 You told me you loved 
 Me 
 Why did you leave me, 
 All alone? 
 Now tell me you 
 Need me 
 When you call me, on 
 The phone 
 Girl I refuse, you must 
 Have me confused 
 With some other guy 
 Your bridges were 
 Burned, and now its 
 Your turn 
 To cry 
 Cry me a river 
 Cry me a river... 
 Cry me a river 
 Cry me a river, 
 Yeah yeah 
 I know that they say 
 That some things are 
 Better left unsaid 
 It wasn't like you only 
 Talked to him and you 
 Know it 
 (Don't act like you don't know it) 
 All these things 
 People told me 
 Keep messin' with my 
 Head 
 (Messin' with my head) 
 You should've picked 
 Honestly 
 Then you may not have 
 Blown it (yeah) 
 Oh, The damage is 
 Done 
 So I guess I be leaving 
 Oh The damage is done 
 So I guess I be leaving 
 Oh The damage is done 
 So I guess I be leaving 
 Oh The damage is done 
 So I guess I be... 
 Leaving
