 Yo look I'm just tryna figure you out 
 He approach me boldly, 
 Said he felt me some, looking lonely, 
 I had to stop and tell him daddy chill 'cause you don't know me 
 He said listen ma I mean no harm 
 Just wanna let you know my story 
 Yo don't be alarmed 
 Usually I'm like the bitchy type 
 Quick to hit 'em with ahha, yeah okay 'ight 
 What's your name again? 
 But I was feeling dude 
 And to my surprise for once I wasn't being rude 
 Had these eyes that would make you melt 
 So what it's corny, that's the way I felt 
 Had this body not a big deal, but it helped 
 I mean this nigga had some shit wit' him 
 And every time I tried to talk 
 He grabbed my hand and said sweetheart just listen

 Yo look I'm just tryna figure you out 
 Felt like I was little, got me back to shy days 
 Is he being real or is he coming at me side ways 
 Said he wanna build wit' me, I'm like here we go 
 Said he was a regular nigga that liked my flow 
 Confidence is key wit' me so I let him go on 
 Casanova saying shit like damn you got the blow on 
 I'm like he did his homework, Knowing what I like 
 Can't find nothing wrong on 'im, And he might be my type 
 Continued with his story 'bout his three years in jail 
 How he missed the streets, 'cause being in there was like hell 
 How his lil' daughter Kira center of his world 
 His princess and she knows she's daddy's lil' girl 
 I'm looking at his face, I look at my watch 
 He smiled, said he wish that time would stop 
 I apologized to him, 'cause I didn't mean to be rude 
 He said I know you busy, just wanted to really meet you

 Yo look I'm just tryna figure you out 
 Asked me if I had a man, I said that I didn't 
 Wanted to know if he could be that wit' my permission 
 Told him that I wasn't ready, he said yeah right 
 Told me that I need a real nigga in my life. 
 I agreed wit' him, told him it would come soon 
 Let him know I had enjoyed the talk but had to run soon 
 Asked me when was the last time I took time for me 
 And if I ever reflected on how shit could be 
 He told me I was blessed, I said dog I know it 
 He said just a reminder feel that way you never blow it 
 Slipped me his number said use it for inspiration 
 Kissed my cheek and whispered thank you for your conversation
