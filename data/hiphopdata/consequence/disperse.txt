(Feat. GLC, Really Doe) 
 (Intro: Consequence) 
 Let me hear you say (HEY) get money (HEY) 
 Get money (HEY) get money (HEY) 
 Get money (HEY) get money (HEY) 
 Now let's go 
 (Chorus: Consequence) 
 'Cause when worse come to worse my peoples come first 
 So if you ain't bustin' down, please disperse (uh) 
 Please disperse (uh) please disperse 
 I know I never should've bought that tease the purse, uh 
 Consequence: 
 But homie that's what happens when your {dick} in the dirt 
 And I guess that's what happens when you're with someone first 
 And you on the Eastside between 2nd and 1st 
 And you pull up on the stop, and she dressed as a nurse 
 And you tell her all the things you mighta hear it in a verse 
 It's surprisin to you, man the scribbly works 
 So she gives you all her numbers plus her name in a chirp 
 And you made sure it's right when you hit the alert 
 Then you call her up tomorrow and you scoop her from work 
 Then you bring her round the way and the crew go berserk 
 Now the only question left is really who's goin' first 
 And if you can't find a condom then you gon' search 
 And by the time you get back shorty way more than burp[?] 
 And she done buttoned up her blouse, and pulled up her skirt 
 And now you ask her what's wrong, and what went wrong 
 If you can't get at Con' then you really ain't a don 
 Now she yellin' out "Cons, you played yourself 
 I wish the playa that I met woulda stayed hisself" 
 What made me say to myself, I need to drop this chick off 
 'Fore the police at the door and they lockin me off 
 Cause you know she's testifyin like a Christian in church 
 So I ain't have no other choice but tell the chick disperse 
 Gangsta L. Crisis: 
 Gin, Coronas in Pamona with Mona 
 From them shots on quarters, pneumonia 
 Up there they warned ya, about girl I put it on ya 
 Let me mack you down in this corner 
 Look like the type that look good in the mornin 
 E'ry time we bonin you moanin 
 Love they way I {fuck} you have you tellin' your homies 
 Tryin' to have {shit} on lock like the police 
 Get mad when the other {hoe} know me 
 Plus it's 'cause they lovin' my goatee, 'fore we was drivin' slowly 
 Went to the West, tryin' to ball like Kobe 
 In the cold bras, was all our trophies 
 Peppermint girl in the show piece 
 Lookin' at that {bitch} low-key in the oldies 
 Love the way them lips is perfect - if you ain't tryin' to show me 
 Baby you can start dispersin, this {shit} ain't workin 
 Really Doe: 
 The venue's sold out, know I'm 'bout to snap 
 Three rows from the front, two seats to the back 
 Hit her with a pass, courtesy of the man 
 Kick it with the stars, bring a couple of friends 
 Let you meet 'Ye, yeah that's the fam 
 Track 14, that's your favorite jam? 
 Damn, I'm in town for the night 
 Take a sip of the potion and let's get right 
 Into some roleplay, be wifey 
 No paper, no charm, I autograph your tee 
 Spotted you on stage dancin all freaky 
 Now you're in the back, actin' shy tweakin 
 This ain't "Meet the Parents, " what the hell you thinkin'? 
 This ain't the church and I ain't the deacon 
 Damn, I'm tryin' to get you out them boots 
 And say the first thing on my mind like Luke 
 Sit back, and chill with the crew 
 Instead you got your mind on my money and my loot 
 Talkin' 'bout "I came back to kick it 
 Let's exchange digits, fly me in, I'll visit" 
 Cool out, you gotta be kiddin 
 But leave your rich parents on the table, now beat it 
 Worse comes to worse my peoples come first (HEY) 
 If you ain't bustin' down (HEY) disperse (HEY) 
 Disperse (HEY) disperse (HEY) 
 Disperse (HEY) disperse (hey) 
 Consequence: 
 'Cause when worse come to worse my peoples come first (uh) 
 So if you ain't bustin' down, please disperse (uh) 
 Please disperse (uh) please disperse (uh) 
 Please disperse, please disperse
