Okay, good music has arrived 
 You and your girls can finally get live 
 I'ma need you to turn the lights down 
 Whatever gon' happen, gon' happen right now 
 Do whatever you want 
 Whatever you want 
 Baby, let me get the number to your Blackberry Curve 
 So I can buy you everything that you deserve 
 I ain't gotta front mama, that's my word 
 With that kinda ass, I might spaz like nerd 
 And buy whatever you want 
 Whatever you want 
 Now I need you to leave home any inhibitions 
 I promise you, won't be any intermissions 
 Wassup with your home girl, I'm so persistent 
 We need an assistant, I'm just kidding 
 Whatever you want 
 Whatever you want 
 The number one team is back, it ain't fair 
 And if you feel the same, raise you glass in the air 
 They like the pack Jordans that come with the wack pair 
 Y'all really don't want it and we're making that clear 
 So do whatever you want 
 Put you hands in the air 
 Wave them around like you just don't care 
 And once you're done with that, keep your hands up high 
 If you're with your girls, let me see you get live 
 And get whatever you want 
 Hey girl, we gon' live it up tonight 
 Hey girl, welcome to the Grammy life 
 Hey girl, you know how this goes 
 'Cause if they all centerfolds is all I know 
 Whatever you want 
 Now when everybody way too aggressive 
 I'ma be the one too cool to even stress 
 Even though I bought dresses, breasts, Benz's, Lexus 
 Yeah, you get the message 
 Whatever you want 
 Whatever you want 
 So don't be shy, baby, pick a handbag 
 And the shoes to match that'll really get them mad 
 And don't worry about it 'cause I'm picking up the tab 
 'Cause nothing gets the girls like a little bit of cash 
 Or whatever they want 
 Hey girl, we gon' live it up tonight 
 Hey girl, welcome to the Grammy life 
 Hey girl, you know how this goes 
 'Cause if they all centerfolds is all I know 
 Whatever you want
