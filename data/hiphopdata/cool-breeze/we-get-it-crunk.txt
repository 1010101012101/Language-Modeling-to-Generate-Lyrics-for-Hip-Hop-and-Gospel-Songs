Cool breeze, kurupt, young gotti 
 In 1999, anything that can happen 
 It will, it will, it will, it will, it will 
 Organized noize, let's do it 
 Kick it off, c'mon 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 Cool breeze, young gotti, organized noize 
 We gon' bust your mothafuckin' mouth open 
 No haters allowed, no haters allowed 
 Uh, no haters allowed

 (Kurupt) 
 Cool breeze, I heard you was a mothafuckin' fool 
 Ah yeah, all 'em wanna see me hit 'em 
 Wanna get blown from my living room to my bed 
 Ya heard what I said? 
 Don't come around here again 
 Changin' the game, re-arrangin' 
 I'm changin' my name 
 Since I shot up the party, I'm 2 shotty young gotti 
 Like givin' a fuck, hold 'em up, nigga wha 
 I'm pressin' it homie, I keep the pistol whisling homie 
 Stashin' it nigga, cocked back, blastin' it nigga 
 Be silent, you can hear the falls tricklin' homie 
 It's ridiculous homie 
 Why the fuck you up on me? 
 That's how mothafuckas lay in caskets nigga 
 (Kurupt and cool breeze) 
 1 - fool what, we get it crunk 
 Comin' through your hood with the sawed off pump 
 Fool what, we get it crunk 
 Comin' through your hood with the sawed off pump 
 Fool, what 
 (Cool breeze) 
 Hey, I hear you screamin' through your whole house 
 Mommy, daddy, turn the TV on 
 Cool breeze done came out 
 And every time I wear some new sneakers 
 They be hatin' on me, all behind my back like some school teachers 
 And be checkin' for me in the streets 
 So they can listen to me real good 
 And go and make a ? that beat 
 Now everybody wanna put it down 
 You give 'em one little record deal and they think they 'bout to run the town 
 And when they album start to get a buzz 
 Everytime you turn around, you see 'em posted all up in a club 
 I think they smokin' too much ? ever body? 
 They try to spit one at me, and we end up spittin' one at everybody 
 It ain't no plan with the hitman 
 He bust ten bars, bust back with both hands 
 So keep your dial locked and stay tuned 
 And when you be down in atlanta, be down with the calhouns

 Is that your homeboy? (is it) 
 Are you for sure? 
 You ever been through war? (this nigga) 
 He up and help you feed your folks 
 Where was this mothafucka when we was broke? 
 Now I ain't mean to offend a nigga 
 But if I struck a nigga, heh, fuck that nigga 
 Punks ain't made around these parts 
 'Cause over here, everybody got heart 
 The homie c double o l, nigga 
 B-r double e z-e 
 When I e-e MC e-e, bitch 
 All y'all hoes is out to get rich 
 And all y'all ? can eat a fat dick 
 Mean and my niggas, we got that get back 
 When we fall through the club, we make everybody get back 
 Niggas know about the dirty south 
 I'mma ask you one time, then you gettin' your back slammed out 
 Cool breeze only 5'7" 
 But I'll break you off quick, and it don't matter if you 5'11" 
 I played ball before I was cool cut 
 Everybody used to call me "don't drop" 
 'Cause I ain't drop nothin' 
 One time I walked up and pulled a gun 
 And laid this dough boy down and made his whole click make buns 
 Now every time I make a run 
 My niggas tell me watch my back 
 'Cause we know they still want some 
 We get it crunk 
 Comin' through your hood with a sawed off pump 
 What 
 We get it crunk
