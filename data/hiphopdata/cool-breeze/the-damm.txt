Yeah, it's fulton county 
 In the woods, where niggaz got bounties hangin' over they heads 
 We done went back down the street 
 And stayed from the concrete treads 
 Let's hit the damm, where all the beavers go chill 
 If you trill you betta not squeal 
 'Cause if you squeal, you will disappear 
 Now that's for trill 
 Verse one: cool breeze 
 Ay, ay, I used to kick the back do' down with the chrome 
 Now when they see me, you oughta hear em, it's like the leash still on 
 (Freeze!) I hit the stage, grab the mic, they gets crunk when I speak 
 Get my money, then I'm out, back at the embassy suites 
 I got some cut with a switch you can't do nothin' but admit 
 I'm east pointe's greatest hit, she all on my stick 
 On the strength she be steamin, she come through for any reason 
 She work at the parisian, and this is polo season 
 Bam, with them calhouns, high-tops for my feet 
 Outfit ain't missin' nuttin like brandy, peep 
 That's how us headland hustlers ball 
 Next stop gonna be greenbriar mall 
 Verse 2: gipp 
 Stay in the streets like a herby curby 
 Some that didn't make it through the rain wasn't worthy 
 96 stamp dirty, flip wide wheels, watch for oil spills 
 What it is, what it ain't, in the paint, some slow by the dank 
 I think, make you go blank, lookin' for work 
 Left you where you started shinin shins, under them skirts 
 At the airport, gipp cruise the hood 
 Like a snake up in the woods lookin' for a cut party 
 Verse 3: khujo 
 You know we don't use the goodie name to pack they function 
 At the last minute, request for, guest appearances, denied 
 Time is money, on the wood, many bed no good 
 Ain't nothin' here for you freak, off-brand frapp, really need to learn 
 How to pick up an alexander graham bell, for she get gripped 
 Get some nights on beaver, made her way through the damm 
 Down stream, two crabs, a set of twins, three fins 
 One main pain was for soldiers to feel 
 Warriors don't take orders, ain't no serial killers in georgia 
 The culprit is blue words in pink skin, so listen our daughters 
 Daddy's little girl, dialling 1-800-earl 
 'Cause she want to do what men do 
 Verse 4: t-mo, cee-lo 
 How I wish, you was the last fish, I would have to catch 
 It was a mess, how the last one, jumped back in the sea 
 Of goddesses, from the swat it is 
 A poor playa with skills to build nations of people 
 Not giving a fuck 'bout no color, we all brothers that ball 
 While others get manipulated and fall 
 Nose wide open to that beast, like it was yo' first 
 To cash in your v-club, is it really love 
 That you feel for her, you a betta man than me 
 To think I can't keep a girl that I like around me 
 And so there's many that await, stay after plate 
 My stomach full after I take a pull 
 Yeah, uh-huh, many gon' come, many gon' go 
 Some thinkin', I'ma overwhelm, fuck the foes 
 Some wanna little time, wanna conversate 
 Some too impatient to wait so we can fully relate 
 Some bouvier, and you bout fall clean through thin ice tryin' to skate 
 Your girl and I all playin' the game, y'all just don't play the same 
 Don't give a fuck and brush up off me, tick, tick, shawty lo be 
 At a piece of being broken for emotion at f-o-e's 
 So she know it's gon' be a strike three 
 But you gotta strike two, huh 
 But at the damn I could find another just like you 
 At the damm I could find another just like you 
 Huh, goodnight boo
