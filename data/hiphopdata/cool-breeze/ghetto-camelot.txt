Where my dogs is at the one that'll bite your ass to pieces 
 Where my cancers at the one that'll cut your ass to shreds 
 (Cool breeze) 
 Hey 
 Y'all better look out, coming to y'all neighborhood soon 
 A lil east point vet and they call him Freddy Calhoun 
 When he was growing up on the block they caled him cutta 
 And said if cool can't cut her, he must've came with her brother 
 He was born and raised right in Martel Homes 
 He moved to cleveland avenue and then washington road. 
 That's when he saw his partner cash first working a triple beam 
 They cut up hundred dollar slabs and sold them 2 for 15 
 Hey his partner had it moving, they had the whole trap bumping 
 He had everybody's hands out, hey let me hold something 
 Check it, his oldest cousin sold his partner a potato and he played it 
 He went and got his oldest brother and thought they was gone pay em. 
 He took his strap out his waist and handed it to big sleigh 
 And stepped right up in his face and said hey playa you cake 
 Now everything cool, Hey fred what's up 
 Now they daping him down and letting him fire up the blunt 
 But playboy I thought I told you that if you ever played him sweet 
 Everytime your family see him y'all gone see him with some cleats 
 Now you calling up Pauly tell him tell breeze 
 Everyting gone be steady playboy, let's get this chesse 
 But see Pauly, he can't help you, cause Pauly ain't know the name 
 And anybody from his block if he do dirt, gone say his name 
 And if a smoker ever went and told the folks that they was rolling 
 Man they'd go and get him drunk and break him off like they ain't know him 
 He met this pretty girl by the name of michelle 
 And her mother had a condo in camelot, on the L 
 So he went over her crib to try to try her but at the crib it wasn't happenin' 
 So he cool cool cut her in the back of National 7 
 (Whild Peach) 
 She had it all, she was a princess, she married a king 
 They lived in camelot happily 
 (Whild Peach) 
 Finally realized one thing in my lifetime, that I die for something, 
 And I hope it's something. 
 Even though it hurst so bad on the inside, 
 Imma make feel so good on the outside 
 'Cause I found something that's really something 
 Something, something
