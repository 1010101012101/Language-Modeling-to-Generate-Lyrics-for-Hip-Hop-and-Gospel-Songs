(Witchdoctor) 
 Million dollas for a hit man 
 Hit man, hit man 
 Gotta represent, noise, noise, noise 
 (Cool breeze) 
 What if your re-up was in this bag? 
 In your car, and we popped the steering wheel 
 And left it up by six flags (hit man) 
 My whole family full of ? hetland? hustlas 
 Now tell your momma y'all ready to move again 
 'Cause we ain't nothin' but trouble 
 My auntie say that I don't pay attention 
 And call the law when she drink 
 And think that that's gon' make me listen 
 Man, I got cousins from the dirty south 
 Who'll walk up to this police car 
 Open the door and let me out (hit man) 
 Me and my family got the most game 
 Just to get close to me, brothers come around 
 And repeat my slang 
 I run this town just like michael jordan 
 Everytime I say wassup 
 My whole click say "just east point!" 
 Brothers come around, givin' us pounds 
 'Cause our family own land in this town 
 Man, you could be black with a acc. 
 Who got a boat full of smack 
 And you wouldn't sell a sack 
 (C.b., backbone) (witchdoctor) 
 1 - we ain't nothin' but some (hit men) 
 50 thousand for a (hit man)

 Dungeon family, we da (hit men) 
 We drop nothin' but them (hit men) 
 Get down with a (hit man) 
 (Witchdoctor) 
 Cool breeze we right here with you, and we gon' blast with you 
 Uh, I was born doin' this hot season 
 Sellin' authentic bloodline, sent to earth to bust rhymes 
 Similar to a machine gun 
 See I fiend and seek funds 
 Be chiefin' like it's the last one (hit man) 
 Blast one car jacker to smitherines 
 If he pull the gat on you first 
 Give him everything but your dreams 
 Atlanta bound, homebase, 2 over 
 We give chase back to the beats 
 Passin' by the police in the streets 
 Georgia on my mind 
 All the peaches to nibble on 
 Back on the grind when all your figures gone 
 Check this out, run with the gat, ya put the clip in it 
 Ah ah, then you check money for the slip in it 
 The world is on fire, sin is murder for hire 
 Whatever evil shit you desire 
 Easy a chameleon, forever changin' 
 Over colors, no more bangin' 
 You wanna keep dead bodies from danglin' on the hit man 
 Three brothers like backbone... 
 We ain't nothing but some (hit man) 
 Hundred thousand for a (hit man) 
 Tell the DJ play a (hit man) 
 East point's greatest (hit man) 
 All the ladies need a (hit man) 
 Dungeon family the (hit man) 
 30 million for a (hit man) 
 It don't stop cause (hit man) 
 (Big boi) 
 Swats ga 
 (Backbone) 
 Through the back door 
 It's front street shorty 
 With mister freddie calhoun the hustla 
 Bringin' pain to these suckers 
 Off the top of the dock, wet you up like fluid 
 Slick, slow down, 'cause we do really get to it 'round here 
 Down here it get hot, see I'm born and bred 
 Till I'm dead, gon' be swat, like it or not 
 It's on 24, like the clock, tick tock 
 Convertible tops, cavarsier on the rocks 
 Potna, this chrome get the attention 
 Don't ask me no questions 
 You drop your books, you lose your lessons 
 Son, this dungeon family 
 You understandin' me? 
 Act like you seen this 
 We on the greenest, I mean this 
 Whatever you feel gone, let it off 
 We amped up and ready to set it off 
 Sound off, sound off, sound off 
 (Witchdoctor) 
 Come on now you see 'em bangin' (hit man) 
 All day everyday we got them (hit man) 
 Understand? ricky ray got them (hit man) 
 Huh? ricky ray got them (hit man) 
 Sleepy brown got them (hit man) 
 Huh? we ain't nothing but some (hit man) 
 Goodie mob got them (hit man) 
 The out got them (hit man) 
 Outkasts got them (hit man) 
 Cool breeze, witchdoctor, lil will (hit man) 
 Come on come on come on come on come on (hit man) 
 Infinity (hit man)
