 There's some rules on these streets that we all go by 
 Dope on these streets that you don't buy 
 Girls in these streets that you let walk by 
 People on these streets that you don't try (2x) 
 (Verse 1: lucky calhoun) 
 I got this hook-up with a jamaican, he got that fire-fire 
 Roll it up, fold it up, now everybody sky high 
 Certain people that you don't try 
 Certain things that you don't buy 
 Listen, live: never try to make that fast sale 
 'Cause when you do, you be on right street makin' bail 
 When you ride, you better ride clean 
 Don't put no work in your pocket, leavin' stains in them calhoun jeans 
 We livin' life, and it's hard knocks 
 Some of y'all pushin weed, some of y'all pushin straight rocks 
 That's why we organized and run with a team 
 When I get the caddy, I flip-flop some cream 
 Lookin' out for girls that be tryin' to scheme 
 Wipe out the fakes, start some triple beam 
 So if you know a hustler, don't even cross that line 
 When you get caught up, go and do your time 
 (Verse 2: pauly calhoun) 
 Now my brother told me, 'never sit with your back to the do' 
 Re-up, not when you out, but when you start gettin' low 
 Play your game, maintain, and watch who you playin' 
 Look them laws dead in they eyes, and tell 'em you ain't seen a thing' 
 Me and my folks on top, we run these blocks 
 We pay the president, the government, plus them dirty cops 
 Pauly calhoun, livin' million-dollar dreams 
 Now spendin the most, we represent the south coast 
 With some utility trucks, blast them 'greatest hit' 
 Co-pilot, most dangerous gator mouth pit 
 'Cause we some hustlin pros, never missin' a beat 
 And we'll match any price if you find it this cheap 
 Trump tight, love hundred-dollar bills 
 Secrets than can kill, you can trust me, my lips are sealed 
 (Verse 3: briand calhoun) 
 Location unknown somewhere in the woods 
 Right back in the smoke stack, fire burnin goods 
 Ain't nothin' goin' on but sackin this hay, and stackin this pape' 
 Huh, we're loaded up, and we'll be on our way 
 See, the last out the blocks is the left-overs 
 We in a lx 470, bein trailed by a rover 
 Tryin' to figure out who's 12th time snitchin 'n' this click, and 
 Inside scoops got my partner pinched for a chicken 
 See a hit, dog, I holler 
 When it gets tight around the collar 
 Never talk for a dollar 
 Rules of a calhoun scholar 
 The rules 
 That's right 
 Gotta know the rules 
 Check it out 
 (Verse 4: cool breeze a/k/a freddie calhoun) 
 There's two things I was taught when I first got here 
 When east point was nothin' but a big dirt hill 
 That when you fight one-on-one, never pull a pistol 
 And you never put your hands on a calhoun sister 
 Now these the type of things you know that's right 
 It's like extra-player points, so live your life 
 Now he said he heard my tape the other day, when he was walkin' 
 It wasn't really like I was rappin', it was more like I was talkin' 
 I said, "well damn, playboy, I don't mean to be braggin 
 But your girl wasn't really suckin, it was more like she was gaggin" 
 Why he naggin, he ain't never showed no love 
 Man, every since I knew him, he always been a scrub 
 So I stepped to him, and he wouldn't hit me 
 'Cause he knew I'd leave and come back and have the whole east point with me 
 So don't you think for once he took my heart 
 Cause the table at my crib was a ? ? true Indian art? ? 
 It's the calhouns
