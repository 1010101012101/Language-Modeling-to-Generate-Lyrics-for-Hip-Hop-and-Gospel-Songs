The only thing I know is how to get this money 
 I'm a get it going, told amigo keep it coming 
 The only thing I know is busting down a brick 
 If she get fucked up for less, a nigga out of chips 
 The only thing I know is busting down a bail 
 Throwing it in the bag and putting it on the scale 
 The only thing I know is how to break a bitch 
 Put her on the strip and told the bitch to get me rich 
 Bitch, I'm a nut 
 Everyday is payday 
 I'll kill a nigga, put that on Kay Kay 
 Shots fired, man down, bitch nigga, Mayday 
 Pull them pistols up, I bet them boys vacate 
 Only thing I know is all these niggas stunt 
 Kill him for his bricks then roll me up a blunt 
 I'm smoking on the skunk, on this money hunt 
 I'm a Glory Boy, and I be gloried up 
 Tatted like amigos, amigos from me kilos 
 We just money repo, bank account say zeroes 
 Call me Chief Sosa De Niro, flyer than a seagull 
 Give my young boys kilos; they serving to your people 
 These niggas ain't 'sleep, though, know they know 'bout me though 
 Who that? I don't even know. I'm finna go see though 
 Hope he holding kilos, Rose bring 'em to me though 
 That's why I am CEO. Fuck you fuck boys mean though? 
 The only thing I know is how to get this money 
 I'm a get it going, told amigo keep it coming 
 The only thing I know is busting down a brick 
 If she get fucked up for less, a nigga out of chips 
 The only thing I know is busting down a bail 
 Throwing it in the bag and putting it on the scale 
 The only thing I know is how to break a bitch 
 Put her on the strip and told the bitch to get me rich
