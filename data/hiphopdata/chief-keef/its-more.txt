For Blood I pour out a 5th, keep on pourin' the shit 
 In the club standing on the couches, enjoying the shit 
 She want all of this dick, I give her majority of the dick 
 Baby I gotta get all this money, need all of the shit 
 But there's more to this shit, girl it's more to this shit 
 Girl it's more to this shit 
 Girl it's more to this shit, baby 
 It's more to this shit 
 It's more to this shit 
 It's more to this shit 
 All I see green, green, nothing in between 
 No brown, no white, all I see green 
 All I see green, love broccoli I eat beans 
 And I smoke trees, so high like I eat leaves 
 Aye I roll off with that gwap, like "Beep Beep" 
 You don't got it like me but yo bitch like Chief Keef 
 She say she love me, then I leave with my cleats 
 I know I was driving but I was running up the streets 
 I walked up in the club, they don't need to see my ID 
 I ain't got no patience, don't need to see my IV 
 I picked up some paper tryna see where that's gon' lead 
 I walked up out the office with a check on 1, 2, 3, 3 
 For Blood I pour out a 5th, keep on pourin' the shit 
 In the club standing on the couches enjoying the shit 
 She want all of this dick, I give her majority of the dick 
 Baby I gotta get all this money, need all of the shit 
 But there's more to this shit, girl it's more to this shit 
 Girl it's more to this shit 
 Girl it's more to this shit, baby 
 It's more to this shit 
 It's more to this shit 
 It's more to this shit 
 I see blue, blue, no I don't see you 
 All I see is blue, is that Blue's clues? 
 If you cross the red, red, shots up in yo head 
 Ya dead, ya dead, just like my dead presidents 
 I pulled them Ben Franklins up out my pocket 
 I know I'm so icy I got my rocket 
 I gave my tech to y'all, you know I T-Mac'd it 
 I took it back a while, this T-Mac spit magic 
 Hop out that clean, with green, shiny like Oil Sheen 
 Spraying shit like Mousse, Rudolph where you going? 
 I'm the king, I'm Mufasa with some wings 
 I want some Wokcano, I don't want chicken wings 
 For Blood I pour out a 5th, keep on pourin' the shit 
 In the club standing on the couches enjoying the shit 
 She want all of this dick, I give her majority of the dick 
 Baby I gotta get all this money, need all of the shit 
 But there's more to this shit, girl it's more to this shit 
 Girl it's more to this shit 
 Girl it's more to this shit, baby 
 It's more to this shit 
 It's more to this shit 
 It's more to this shit
