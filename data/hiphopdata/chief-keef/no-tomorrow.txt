(Hook:Chief Keef) 
 I ain't worried 'bout you shorty 
 I'm so use to balling 
 I don't even want you darling 
 Why do you be calling 
 Why your bitch love stalking 
 Every night, Every Morning 
 Starting to make me go harder 
 Plus I got a daughter 
 Ball like it's no tomorrow 
 I'mma buy a Audemar 
 Don't care about the costs 
 Ball like it's no tomorrow 
 Bitch you chilling with a star 
 Act like it's no tomorrow 
 I'ma buy a foreign car 
 And drive it like it's no tomorrow 
 (Verse 1: Chief keef) 
 I be riding foreign cars 
 Riding like it no tomorrow 
 I be spending hella bands 
 I be high above the stars 
 I be chilling with my dogs 
 Fucking on them hoes 
 Lotta pound lotta O's 
 Lotta of bankrolls and clothes 
 Lotta ice white and gold 
 Tats on my arms 
 Lotta Hoes on my line 
 I be touring fuckin' hoes 
 Ben franklin bank rolls 
 LV's on my clothes 
 Jump man on my kicks 
 Don't like them gucci shits 
 Got a lot of Louie shit 
 And a lot of fendi shit 
 Got ferragamo shit 
 Bitch I got plenty shit 
 I ball like it's no tomorrow 
 Bitch I'mma glory boy 
 All I know is go hard 
 Because I got a daughter 
 (Verse 2: Chief keef) 
 This man bitch steady calling 
 I wonder how she got my number 
 I think she got it from Ballout 
 You know we them bang brothers 
 Flexing on you suckers 
 All the bitches love us 
 Tadoe off the molly water 
 So you know it's no discussion 
 Get fredo out the cut 
 He fucking shit up 
 Ball like it's no tomorrow 
 'Cause I chose to live it up 
 Got dope in my blunt 
 Got lean in my cup 
 'Cause I'm rolling off a flat 
 Just like Dillenger 
 Bitch I got burberry on 
 Sent that drink for you boss 
 Y'all know I go hard 
 And so does my squad 
 I get very very tall 
 Things getting taller 
 I ain't with the drama I could fuck your mama
