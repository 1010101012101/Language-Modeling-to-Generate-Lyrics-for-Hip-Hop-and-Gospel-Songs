GBE baby Sosa baby 
 Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin' 
 Bad bitches keep callin' 
 I swear this money keep fallin' 
 I bet it's this bitch callin' 
 I don't even wanna start in 
 'Cause I'm ballin' 
 Bitch I'm ballin' 
 (Verse 1-Chief Keef) 
 Rollin' up this dope 
 Pop a nigga something like crisco 
 All I do is spend dough 
 I don't even know this bitch no mo' 
 'Cause I'm ballin' 
 So please bitch stop callin' 
 Bitch I'm Chief Keef 
 Every bitch know me 
 If the bitch don't know me 
 Let me tell you hoes 'bout me 
 Bitch I'm ballin' 
 And we shoot no talkin' 
 Rockin' in my pink dolphin 
 Finna pop me a blue dolphin 
 Broke ass niggas who talkin' 
 If you ain't talkin' money than you through talkin' 
 Bitch I'm ballin' 
 On these broke niggas, I'm ballin' 
 Ballin', ballin' 
 Bad bitches keep callin' 
 I swear this money keep fallin' 
 I'm best friends with Ben Shawty 
 I don't even wanna start in 
 'Cause I'm ballin' 
 Bitch I'm ballin' 
 Sippin' on that lean 
 I go hard for my team 
 Pockets filled with that green 
 I just blow it all on my team 
 'Cause I'm ballin' 
 Nigga I'm ballin' 
 (Verse 2-Chief Keef) 
 Ride around wit my 3 hunnas 
 All my niggas, we stuntin' 
 Spendin commas, bitch it's nothin' 
 And I'm eatin, got me a big stomach 
 'Cause I'm ballin' 
 I'm ballin', I'm ballin' 
 I be countin' them stacks 
 Crackin' cards, get back 
 I gets me a big check 
 And everything designer but it's mismatch 
 'Cause I'm ballin' 
 I'm ballin' like spaldin' 
 Trus off my ass 
 Pockets filled with that cash 
 Niggas see me, they mad 
 Bitches see me, they pants I'm in fallin' 
 Now I'm through talkin' 
 'Cause I'm ballin', I'm ballin' 
 Bad bitches keep callin' 
 I swear this money keep fallin' 
 I'm best friends with Ben Shawty 
 I don't even wanna start in 
 'Cause I'm ballin' 
 Bitch I'm ballin' 
 Sippin on that lean 
 I go hard for my team 
 Pockets filled with that green 
 I just blow it all on my team 
 'Cause I'm ballin' 
 Nigga I'm ballin'
