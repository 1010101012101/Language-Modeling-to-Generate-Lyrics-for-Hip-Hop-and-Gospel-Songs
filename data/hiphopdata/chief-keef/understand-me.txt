Chief keef:

 FTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFTFT bing! bing! bing! 
 (HOOK: Chief Keef) 
 That bitch say that she don't understand me. (Fucker) 
 I be flexing 
 Now my money come in handy 
 I gotta get this money 
 Understand me? 
 100 thous all hundreds understand me (understand me) 
 Understand me, (understand me) 
 I gotta get this money 
 Understand me (understand me) 
 Understand me 
 Bitch my name is Sosa 
 You can call me Sammy 
 Verse 1 Chief Keef: 
 Everywhere I go I spend a lot of cash 
 Spend them stacks, spend them stacks and get it back 
 OTF my niggas they invented that (OTF) 
 Smoking on this loud, call it the stinky pack (dope) 
 Count so much money that my fingers cramp 
 All my niggas Wildin' we don't give a damn (loony) 
 Ask your main bitch she know who I am (Sosa Baby) 
 Rob him for his taxes if he's a son of Sam 
 Who gives a fuck, we don't care bout nothin' Fam! 
 Got money for a verse, send it through money gram 
 I'mma drop the top when I buy me a fast car 
 Kidnap this fuck nigga for some ransom 
 And if his mouth moving, my gun dance-ON 
 I pull up in that Porsche, they like "Damn, son!" 
 All these bitches on me, I won't wife none 
 I have them bitches runnin', when the pipe come 
 (Verse 2 Young Jeezy) 
 Fake ass niggas that's a shit I don't like 
 Kilogram flow, that's the shit I don't write 
 All these fucking games, that's the shit I don't play 
 2 door Murcielago and its smoke grey 
 Keep that 50 cal. that bitch come in handy 
 It will open up a nigga like some candy (BOOM) 
 In the barrel, look like a Cambell's soup can 
 Banana clips in the closet like a fruit stand (HAHA) 
 Talkin' 36 O's and I'm the OG 
 One time I sit and watch a nigga snort a whole key 
 Muzzle on the rock, while it flash it goes bang 
 Spent a hundred grand one ring, no chain 
 Got 'em pitchin wild 100's, keep it 300 
 Man that head so good bought her a 300 
 Understand me 
 Nigga 
 Understand me 
 Understand me 
 If thuggin' was a catgory 
 I'd win a Grammy 
 (Hook: Chief Keef)
