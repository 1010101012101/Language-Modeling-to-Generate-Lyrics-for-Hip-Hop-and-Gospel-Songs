SOSA [x5] 
 Them bitches screaming out, sosa 
 Who always off the loud, sosa 
 Shooting niggas down, sosa 
 I'm at the top, you niggas down, catch up 
 Them bitches screaming out, sosa 
 Who always off the loud, sosa 
 Shooting niggas down, sosa 
 I'm at the top, you niggas down, catch up 
 Who smoking on the loud sosa (bang, bang!) 
 Known all around sosa 
 Rob you for your pound, catch up 
 I'm on top, you niggas down, catch up 
 Rolling off a 3 in it 
 I can't lose, I'm so used to winning 
 If you deliver bullets, send it 
 We got them beams, shoot that gun, sent itch? 
 I'm ridin' with my gualla-guallas 
 And we some fucking ballin'-ballers 
 And campaign sosa bitch nigga follow 
 Middle fingers to them fucking 'oppas 
 Shots fired, 9 niggas falling 
 We see an 'oppa, My lil niggas off him 
 It's not my asthma kush got me coughing 
 Real nigga.com, bitch nigga login 
 3hunna niggas with me and we all smashing 
 Fuck a bitch and get money, I got a passion 
 It's you who gon' do the team bitch I was asking 
 Smoking trees and I'm busy lumberjacking 
 Bustin' bitches with my gualla-guallas 
 Ain't paying no hoes, we some shot-callers 
 Living life like there's no tomorrow 
 Everything I do, bitch, I do it for my daughter
