She say you be stunting bitch that's everyday 
 She wanna chill with Sosa but not every day 
 Everyday, everyday, everyday 
 She wanna chill with Sosa but not every day 
 I be smoking dope shit, that's everyday 
 3hunna swole, bitch we be up in the place 
 Don't care what you say, shit that's everyday 
 Sosa always with this nigga shit, that's everyday 
 Can't compare an eye, 'cause I'm hot as fuck 
 I'm buying foreign cars and some Tonka trucks 
 No snitching but we let you walk 
 Shoot them bullets, ain't nobody hot as us 
 I'm a Leo but my fucking birthday every day 
 Hope I be at the awards fucking Mary Kate 
 I'm a Leo but my fucking birthday everyday 
 Hope I be at the awards fucking Lil Kate 
 She say you be stunting, bitch that's everyday 
 All my money go on dope, shit that's everyday 
 She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day 
 Fuck on any nigga bitch, shit that's everyday 
 Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday 
 She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day 
 OTF, bitch I rep that shit like everyday 
 GBE, bitch I rep that shit like everyday 
 If you think it's chicken then its bombs away 
 Ringing down your block, make you run away 
 Man I get so high I can't pronounciate 
 Run up in your house where your money safe 
 We be making moves, shit that's everyday 
 I don't stack money, I spend it in every way 
 Damn, all this money on my land line 
 Up all day, bitch we don't sleep we vampires 
 40 on my hip, click clack then fire 
 We don't do this everyday, you's a damn liar
