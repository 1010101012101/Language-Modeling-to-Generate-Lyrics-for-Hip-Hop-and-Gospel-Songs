Fuck the bitch she doin' right 
 Bad boy, rude boy 
 Heavy money in my pants, boy your money too light 
 One plus one equals two, yeah you're right 
 Bitches come through and fuck me like it's 2 of 1 
 Keep it cool boy, you boy, one boy, 2 boy 
 100 thousand dollar car, I can get 2 for it 
 Pull up inside of your level, I'm a jerk, new boy 
 I fuck with all the old school rappers, I'm a new school boy 
 I'm smoking dope, you smoking on the fool boy 
 I'm riding foreign, rims look like 4 new boys 
 I'm smoking olds, I smoke out the peace too boy 
 I'm sweating like I got a fever, jewelry be the flu boy 
 You should know, we don't fuck with new boys 
 I treat these niggas like the bottom of my shoes boy 
 I want a boat but I bought a coupe boy 
 And bought a 4, so when I get tired of 2 boy 
 I switch it over, hop up in my 4 door

 Since I'm the captain of the ship, I tell your ho to board 
 Ay bitch I'm the score, you better not be boring 
 Fuck the bitch she doin' right
