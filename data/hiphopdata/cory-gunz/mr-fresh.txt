1, 2 buckle my shoe, unlaced ears, lil mama what it do (what you mean?) 
 What it do to fit you on those jeans, 
 On your thighs so tight it's like your hips can't breathe 
 I'm in the spot with my wrist on freeze 
 N a couple of thugs with a grip on squeeze 
 Pair of champs on, I get my limp on 
 Like I get my pimp on play you just bench warm 
 Summertime my louis flips on 
 Before I make you wana get ur tip on 
 U said lil ron'names his own 
 He keeps it fly, I don't knw wat ur man's on 
 See I less see once we get our benz on 
 U step on my nikes ices with ur chin zone 
 I'm in this game just tryin' to get my friends on 
 And all you blockers get defended 
 Now y'all you tell me... 
 Is the fitted low? YES 
 Money low? NO 
 Ice Bright? BRIGHT 
 Kicks tight? 4 SHO 
 Game tight? 4 SHO 
 Haters see me? YES 
 Never none less lil homie just call me Mr. Fresh 
 Just call me MR. FRESH (4x) 
 They like why you gotta be so fly? 
 Homie I got it from the street no lie 
 Between me n u shorty I see bare sheets 
 It must be in opposite the dead sleep 
 See me pull up in the red jeep 
 See me hop out with the red sneaks 
 See me pull up in the blue coup 
 Rims match the kicks blue boots 
 See me pull up in some green clean 
 Prob rockin' a pair of mean greens 
 But you don't know I get green seems 
 The US prob in the same dream 
 Heavy glin I make my limousines lean 
 Ain't no 1 ons we known to intervien 
 But I swear if I looked you in the face 
 It'll b like I took a picture in ur face 
 Or rather like Tyson hit you in the face 
 U waitin to take my shit now this a taste 
 Now y'all you tell me... 
 Is the fitted low? YES 
 Money low? NO 
 Ice Bright? BRIGHT 
 Kicks tight? 4 SHO 
 Game tight? 4 SHO 
 Haters see me? YES 
 Never none less lil homie just call me Mr. Fresh 
 Just call me MR. FRESH (4x) 
 You wanna know what I'm about? paper 
 The way you put your money let ya mouth make-up 
 I make ya lil mama shell break-up 
 I'm just a lil fresh spouse taker 
 Ya sleepin' on me homie better wake up 
 Ya girl just spotted me comin' outta jacob 
 Her thoughts are probably that I got my cake up 
 My wieghts up I ain't gotta play tough 
 Pimpin' that's just how I'm livin' 
 Chill in spots you wich you could live in 
 Sippin' spinnin' women linen 
 We grindin' shinin' gripin' winnin' 
 Names exchanged digits are givin' 
 Slackin' my mack nim slippin' my pimin' 
 Gonna splurge like this shit is tradition 
 Motha herbs got the chips 
 Now y'all you tell me... 
 Is the fitted low? YES 
 Money low? NO 
 Ice Bright? BRIGHT

 Game tight? 4 SHO
