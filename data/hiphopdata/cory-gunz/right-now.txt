Light the motherfucking roof on fire 
 Know you see that coupe when we ride 
 (Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up) 
 I'm talkin' right now, right now 
 Shawty slide, I'm talkin' right now, right now 
 Light the motherfucking roof on fire 
 See that coupe when we ride 
 Yeah, ok the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn (Let it burn) 
 Yo friend took a molly, it's yo motherfucking turn (Yo turn) 
 And y'all know all my money straight (It's straight) 
 Like a motherfucking perm (No perm) 
 And all I get is brain, and still ain't motherfucking learn 
 Hold up, nigga right now, turn the lights down 
 With a thick bad bitch and she light brown 
 And she gone make that ass clap, for a real nigga like right now 
 Oh, and I'm iced down, but that pussy so wet nigga might drown 
 With my swimwear, I jump in there, like splash 
 Light the motherfucking roof on fire (Wooooooh)

 Fuck hoes we don't love those 
 Nigga you don't live by the thug code 
 It's levels to this shit it's metals in this shit 
 And several niggas get introduced to the snub nose 
 Stomp niggas out till the club close, leave a nigga shirt filled with mud holes 
 All my flows they love those, we ain't the same set but you wearing blood clothes 
 I'm loaded now, fuck you talking 'bout?

 Light the motherfucking roof on fire (Wooooooh)

 Man what it look like, being a nigga got the lot of y'all 
 Little snitch nigga like a fly on the wall 
 And I'm in a chick head like Tylenol 
 And I roll up in that black 'Bach, Matte black or that black Lac 
 And I put another hole in your snapback, step back, act bad 
 Who said something I ain't getting on nothing 
 Nigga picture that 
 Pop that nigga, stop that nigga 
 Drop that nigga, watch that nigga, rock that nigga 
 We get it back 
 When I turn up niggas wanna chill (Niggas wanna chill?) 
 I figured that 
 Murder back on that old ish 
 Point me back where the strippers at 
 Light the motherfucking roof on fire (Wooooooh)
