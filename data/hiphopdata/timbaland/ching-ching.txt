 (Timbaland) 
 Leave it girl' 
 Tim took you from ghetto to class, how to hold your glass 
 To Fendi's to bags, for holdin' your cash 
 People was seein' you pass, like right through the drapes 
 I brought you the private, ounce wit the gates 
 Thinkin' that stuff make me faint, just whistle real fast 
 Cougars roll in the grass, same cat on your Jag 
 Why your keepin' them tabs, and callin' me for 
 It cost every minute, and you know I'm on tour 
 And I'm deeply committed, although I'm forgettin' 
 Sometimes while hittin' it, different names would slip 
 If I been wit a chick, check me miss 
 Your complexion switched, honey you been on trips 
 But you don't appreciate this, till your back in the Jetta 
 No iceberg you own, just Angelica's sweaters 
 If the steaks ain't T-Bone, you ain't properly fed 
 But tonight is bet burgers, no cheese on the bread 
 And I say

 (Miss. Jade) 
 Boy you act like I need ya, came down wit amnesia 
 Ran the yards and the meters, nuttin' but hating between us 
 Now you come poppin' that whip, nigga I made you rich 
 Introduce you to chips, flipped and secured your bricks 
 Even though them kids ain't mine, let 'em call me mommy 
 I deserve them dollars, trip to the Bahamas and Hummer ridin' 
 I washed your clothes, put up wit your hoes 
 Never fucked up yo dough, put the G in ya glow 
 So what you sweatin' me fo', I promoted them tours 
 I was poppin' them fours, run in and outta them stores 
 I cleaned up your spot, poured your brandy and scotch 
 Razor blades to the rocks, even lied to the cops 
 Played your wifey and mother, cousin, sister and brother 
 Accountant lawyer and lover, I'm through dealin' wit suckers 
 Shuttin' and lockin' the door, bout to settle the score 
 You wastin' my time, nigga, but what about my nigga 
 (Miss. Jade and Nelly Furtado)

 (Miss. Jade) 
 Boy money ain't everything, married minus the ring 
 Frequent Coach, mink coats, cruises on ships and boats 
 I gave you way more, can't there bout all your bulls 
 Since day one it was ours it never was yours 
 Uh - look at the bigger picture, study the ghetto scripture 
 Held your back when you was broke frontin' 'cause now you richer 
 No frontin' in that there, Ms. Jade is everywhere 
 Enough talkin' I'm through, my lawyer will be callin' you 
 (Nelly Furtado) 
 All this money that he's spendin', you owe me everything 
 I wanna tell him it's not his money, he tell me to go away, baby 
 Wish he'd only give me a chance to show him that I'm alive 
 I'm gonna be there and you need peace and tender all up in his life 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
