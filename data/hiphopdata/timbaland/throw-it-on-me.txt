 Take it to the back of the club 
 Fast talkin' don't take it the wrong way

 Timbaland 
 I got so many broads 
 Like cars 
 Different 2 or 3 in the same day 
 And when I park my car 
 Soon as I walk in the spot women say they 
 Showin' me titty's 
 And they callin' my name all night 
 God damn thing 
 Niggas is hatin' on me 
 'Cause they wanna throw they thing on me 
 Like it's okay, girl.

 Timbaland 
 Girl, now the look at that ass 
 You probably a gold digger 
 But I ain't Kanye 
 Baby girl you on the right track 
 But you goin' the wrong way 
 And when we're through with the party 
 Girl I got a game that we gon' play 
 And by tomorrow I'll be on the highway 
 Peace!
