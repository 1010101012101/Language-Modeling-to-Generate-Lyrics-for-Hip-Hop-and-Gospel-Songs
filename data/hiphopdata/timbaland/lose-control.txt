Timbaland and JoJo: 
 Talkin' 'about my baby 
 'Cause we always breakin' the mold 
 Talkin' 'about my baby 
 We don't need no secret code 
 The way you love me down 
 Got me goin' around 
 I think, I think, I think I'm Losin' Control 
 The way you love me down 
 Got me goin' around 
 I think, I think, I think I'm Losin' Control 
 The way you love me

 Timbaland: 
 Hey lady 
 I know it gets hard sometimes 
 Hey lady 
 You been gettin' what you want from me 
 Hey lady 
 My love is always on the grind 
 Hey lady 
 How far I gotta go to reach you. 
 JoJo:

 When I stand 
 By your side, oh. 
 Both:

 JoJo: 
 I have a bad day 
 I don't act right 
 Get up under your skin 
 I know it ain't right 
 How I ask you 
 To give up everything 
 Boy just stop what your doin' and come and follow me around 
 Baby, thank you for the second chances. 
 And everything you did to help advance at this 
 You put up with my shit. 
 How can you be my best? 
 Boy you really got it goin' on. 
 JoJo:

 You know my girl get the keys with the em's on it 
 She have the range night, I'm in a benz mornin' 
 Bought plenty of ice for them shinin' on your friends moments 
 I'll give her anything she want if it look good on her 
 And we be chillin' like a bottle sittin' on the rocks 
 Shoppin' bags full of cartier forget-me-nots 
 But money can't buy you love, baby that's a fact 
 But you can rent some love with a couple stacks 
 Man I gotta lease nothin' I own one 
 And every time I hit, she say it's a home run 
 When asked how can we be serious at so young 
 I just say I'm in it for the long run.
