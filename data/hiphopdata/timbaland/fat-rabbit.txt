I be that nigga named Luda 
 Aka l-o-v-a l-o-v-a 
 Fuck that Shit 
 Nigga what you wanna say 
 One Time 
 South Side lets ride 
 And if you love what you do 
 Do what you feel 
 Then I know you gon mark my words 
 I drop shit like birds 
 And its about that time for yo ass to get served 
 Just lay it on down 
 Just lay it on down 
 While we relax to the tight raps 
 And the fat tracks 
 That the nigga Timbaland put down 
 Oh yes 
 Let's get it on down to the nitty grit 
 Don t have no time for no petty shit 
 'Cause I got more dick than a little bit 
 And time flies when I'm havin' fun 
 I can make a hoe get like Forest Gump and just run 
 Baby run 
 I guess that they can't handle this 
 The brother just too scandals 
 If you don't wanna get freaked 
 Get up out my way just like in an ambulance 
 Getty up Getty up right on to the real 
 And death to the fake 
 And tell your boyfriend just to chill 
 Don t player hate 
 Kick back relax and just take off yo shoes 
 While I kinda tell you what's I want to do 
 Let me touch it (Let me touch it) 
 Let me feel it (Let me feel it) 
 Let me grab it (Let me grab it) 
 That phat rabbit (That phat rabbit) 
 Fatter than fat 
 Fat like a dub sack 
 Showin 'em where that loves at 
 So open up yo eyes and get a surprise like 
 In Cracker jacks 
 Pooh Nan Don Happy 
 Giving up that nappy dugout 
 Get the cut up then I cut out 
 Why you standing there wit yo butt out 
 And it's always in the back of my mind 
 Whatever the place whatever the time 
 Even in college park after dark 
 I'm a get that sunshine 
 Closer than close 
 Closer than most then I'm all up in ya 
 For beginners give me a thigh, breast and leg 
 Like Mrs. Winner s 
 And let dinner be served 
 Can I get it on a platter 
 Shatter yo bladder 
 And put so much light in yo life 
 I'll make the roaches scatter 
 The wetter the better 
 I'm ready to get ya 
 Got to have that rabbit like that cheddar 
 So I could freak you like I just met ya 
 Hot like a sauna get comfy like in a Cadillac 
 Nick nack paddy wack 
 Give a dog a bone jack 
 Kick back relax and just take off yo shoes 
 While I kinda tell you what I wants to do 
 Your love is supercalafragalistic 
 You don't know how bad I missed it 
 If it's broke then don't fix it 
 Yo stuff is butter like a biscut 
 Reminisce like Mary 
 I got to pop that cherry 
 Kind of like that coochie 
 You wanna be my hoochie 
 Better than my adversary 
 Don t be so scary 
 I never thought that you could act up 
 Make a nigga wanna back up 
 Keep it tight for the night 
 While I wet this track up 
 So we can slip and slide 
 Make you wanna dip and dive 
 Trippin' while we rip and ride 
 Till I get you to come inside 
 Got you where I want your ass 
 In the case of an emergency brake the glass 
 Keep yo eyes on the present 
 And erase the past 
 And be happy if we got more blunts to pass 
 Get done up and run up 
 In the guts of ya butt 
 Don t shake like it used to 
 I wake 'em up like a rooster 
 Take it slow not fast 
 In a turbo buster 
 No worry 
 No hurry 
 No pain no gain 
 Better keep yo eyes on strain 
 Cause ain't a damn thing changed maine 
 Sit back relax and just take off yo shoes 
 While I gotta tell you what I wants to do 
 Yeah
