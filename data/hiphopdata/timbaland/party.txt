Buddy you can't be serious man 
 All my ladiiies put up your vaseline 
 This a party not a ¿Contenblow? of isine 
 Come here baby won't you lick up on this ice cream 
 Come here baby won't you get with this A team 
 'Cause we got plenty of bling, plenty of cars 
 Plenty of things, and honey we all stars (huh) 
 See I got the game, the game don't got me 
 See I got the fame, the fame don't got me 
 Why you had to leave me this way 
 I love you till this day 
 All I want to see is big booties and big titties 
 And all sexy lingerie 
 You don't like me, you can go to hell 
 But I'm with five chicks, sippin zippindale 
 Laid up in the four seasons hotel 
 All my dogs finished, let me hear ya yell 
 Girls, show your draws, 'cause it's a party up in here 
 Fellas, oh yo, lets make this whole room clear 
 Girls, show your draws, 'cause it's a party up in here 
 Fellas, oh yo, lets make this whole room clear 
 Girls drop your draws for the whips and the chum 
 Its just sin the don, molesting your thong 
 I'm aroused spit the pound, get 'em around 
 Gave her numbers to dial, now I'm all on the prowl 
 Made a red bowl well known 
 Left my head blown like so hard, oh god 
 She's a actress, a ¿new po felaptus? 
 Ran to the store, I can't go wrong 
 Do I want more like clear to one head 
 Spread your legs on my Versace bed spread 
 My wrist bricked up see the ice on my arm 
 Need two parking lots to park my car 
 I'ma star, Play the bar here's a tip 
 Girl move your hips, put this between your tits 
 Buddy it's a hit when I came in the door 
 And I said it before I want to see draws 
 Girls, show your draws, 'cause it's a party up in here 
 Fellas oh yo, lets make this whole room clear 
 Girls, show your draws, 'cause it's a party up in here 
 Fellas oh yo, lets make this whole room clear 
 I spit amazing, hot when I rap 
 I only spend stacks, cause baby got back 
 Shake that ass, and do what you want to 
 Hoes run on me like I'm the number one stunna 
 When I walk in they started the stalkin' 
 But let me mention, I like the attention 
 Grab they extension, and make that coochie pop 
 Shake it don't stop, drop it like its hot 
 Whisper in her ear, I got the big T.I.P. 
 You gotta do more than whatchu do in V.I.P. 
 Grab it, and shake it, and lick it around 
 If you do it kinda proper I might stick around 
 Slow down, hoe down, woe now 
 Its feelin' good 
 Next day, guess who's on my two way 
 Janet Jackson, time for action 
 Girls, show your draws, 'cause it's a party up in here 
 Fellas oh yo, lets make this whole room clear 
 Girls, show your draws, 'cause it's a party up in here 
 Fellas oh yo, lets make this whole room clear 
 Girls, show your draws, 'cause it's a party up in here 
 Fellas oh yo, lets make this whole room clear 
 Girls, show your draws, 'cause it's a party up in here 
 Fellas oh yo, lets make this whole room clear
