 All I wanna do is makeup 
 All I wanna do is makeup 
 All I wanna do is makeup 
 All I wanna do is makeup 
 All I wanna do is makeup 
 All I wanna do is makeup 
 All I wanna do is makeup 
 The best part I know 
 Broken promises 
 Broken weddin vows 
 Its hard as lookin' down 
 No, not even crack a smile (crack a smile) 
 How can I support a child? 
 Last time I had a job 
 It's been awhile 
 The question that remains so freely 
 Why does thatta happen to me (to me) 
 To wash away the pain 
 I'm drinking 
 I'm thinking 
 Chad Kroeger 
 I waited for the day that 
 Together we can find another way back 
 But everything we've got at stake 
 Lets worry about today and put tomorrow in a bottle 
 If there's some way that we can take back 
 The wrong that we've created 
 We can change that 
 Don't turn your head the other way 
 You're gunna save today 
 But tomorrow in a bottle 
 Let's put tomorrow in a bottle 
 Let's put tomorrow in a bottle 
 Let's put tomorrow in a bottle 
 Let's put tomorrow in a bottle 
 Let's put tomorrow in a bottle 
 Let's put tomorrow in a bottle 
 Let's put tomorrow in a bottle 
 Let's put tomorrow in a bottle 
 Pack it up, seal it up, close the deal (the deal)

 Girl you ain't right 
 I apologize 
 Don't be satisfied 
 To what we had was gone away (hey hey) 
 Every other day we cuss we fight (hey hey) 
 And 2 wrongs don't make a right 
 You had my head gone 
 I did you dead wrong 
 Singin' that same old song 
 Wonderin why you mad at me (at me) 
 Now you understand my lingo 
 We still gon' be people 
 Baby this is how it should be 
 I knew you'd be like that 
 You was sposed to have my back 
 Now we both don't know how to act 
 Once I leave the door at my baby back

 Sebastian 
 Said I never thought that all that the love we had would go away 
 Now there's nothing left that you can say 
 That's the way shit gunna be the same 
 'Cause my back against the wall 
 Now the conclusion to the story is the same 
 I was your bread and butter 
 Like girl I put you on 
 Now that I want that lovin' back 
 Why's the relationship so gone 
 Like we established the fact 
 That you was wrong from the get 
 How am I sposed to fly in my ex 
 From Tallahasee and back 
 When a girl is scared of heights 
 Said have you seen them jets 
 Now put her in the back 
 When the first class got delayed the snacks 
 People can blame my past 
 People can kiss my ass 
 I'm at a loss for words 
 Chad gon' sing the rest 
 Chad Kroeger 
 I'm waitin for the day that 
 Together we can find a way back

 Let's put tomorrow in a bottle 
 Let's put tomorrow in a bottle 
 Let's put tomorrow in a bottle 
 Let's put tomorrow in a bottle
