Timbaland: 
 Yeah 
 1-2, welcome to, welcome to La La Land 
 Max C.: 
 It's not all about the money, not all about the fame 
 Not all about the money money... 
 Timbaland: 
 La La La 
 Max C.: 
 It's not all about the money, not all about the fame 
 Not all about the money money... 
 Timbaland: 
 Ti-ti-timati! 
 Timati: 
 Baby girl let me haller at you 
 Hop in a seat this car's faster 
 But take a minute, let me explain 
 You need somebody who ride when time change 
 Could you be the one to ride it shotgun 
 I hope in my heart you're the right one 
 See we've never been fake, we've been very thick 
 Don't worry 'bout the stars with bright glare 
 You would get it girl but you ain't like that 
 I see you're different, I like that 
 See, the money and the cars don't mean a thing 
 It ain't about the fame, it's still a game 
 If you hold my baby, truly your man, just stick to the plan 
 Gonna give you my last name, gonna show you I ain't playin' 
 These girls be all over me but I know they ain't down for me 
 I see my future with you girl, I see you brought on the world 
 Could you be the one to ride it shotgun 
 I hope in my heart you're the right one 
 See we've never been fake, we've been very thick 
 Don't worry 'bout the stars with bright glare 
 Max C.: 
 Now she got a hold on me 
 Timati: 
 I've got a girl and I know damn well she loves me 
 Max C.: 
 And she got control of me 
 Timati: 
 I've been down and I'm never gonna leave her lonely 
 Max C.: 
 It's not all about the money, not all about the fame 
 Not all about the money money... 
 It's not all about the money, not all about the fame 
 Not all about the money money... 
 It's not all about the money, not all about the fame 
 See, I don't really get her, she really don't mean a thing 
 I just need you by my side, don't you ever go away 
 I'll do anything, I want you to stay 
 Oh-oh oh-oh 
 Just stay 
 Oh-oh oh-oh 
 Just stay 
 Oh-oh oh-oh 
 Oh woh 
 Grooya: 
 I know you're used to flashy things and the high life 
 But I'm not that type of girl that you can buy 
 You gotta love me but you're not, not boy 
 'Cause I've been true from the start, start boy 
 Na-na na-na-na thanks, can't put me in the net 
 If would spend the time with me 
 Timbaland: 
 Yeah 
 Grooya: 
 Ye-ye ye-ye-ye I'm the girl you need to meet 
 I need you dedicated fully to me 
 Max C.: 
 She got a hold on me 
 Grooya: 
 I've got a guy and I know damn well he loves me 
 Max C.: 
 And she got control of me 
 Grooya: 
 I've been down and I'm never gonna leave him lonely 
 Max C.: 
 Money money money money
