Timbaland: 
 Hey Hey We fuss we fight your fault my fault 
 We was on the same team least that's what I thought

 Now we hardly conversatin' baby, we don't talk 
 It was fun at first, you can't say I'm wrong. 
 Now you wanna talk about it? Too late, I'm gone 
 You mad at me 'cause I don't wanna play your game 
 I ain't perfect but I'm a do my thing 
 We gotta Meet In Tha Middle 
 You here I'm there. 
 Tell me what's the sence in me tryin' if you don't care? 
 This relationship is headin' to who knows where 
 That means one of us got to chose 
 Because You hurt me & I hurt you 
 You complain about the things that I don't do 
 I don't wanna take the blame neither do you 
 Because we got too much to lose.

 You can't travel to the future if you walk backwards 
 Once you walk out the door, you can't walk back in 
 We gotta find a way to solve it, think about our kids 
 'Cause they in tha middle. 
 You wanna sing that song? 
 You want me to cop that plead and say okay I'm wrong?

 Bran' Nu: 
 I told you once, I told you twice 
 And now my shoulders cold, like a block of ice 
 You playin' games like you rollin' dice. 
 Hey what you know about a sacrifice? 
 Baby I've been in tha middle... 
 I've been givin' you more than a little 
 Had the ball than you double dribble 
 I guess love is a riddle... 
 You never listen I don't ever get my point across 
 I washed your dirty draws, you out with dirty broads 
 You did me dirty dawg 'cause you's a dirty dog 
 It's a quit 'n' call & I ain't mad at all 
 I gave you more than you deserve, I was worth it all 
 Bottom line I hope you find what you searchin' for. 
 Bran' Nu: 
 You hurt me, said I hurt you 
 And I complain about the things that you don't do 
 And I don't wanna take the blame neither do you 
 We got too much to lose...
