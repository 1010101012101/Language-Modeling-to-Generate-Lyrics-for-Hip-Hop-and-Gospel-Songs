Why are you all looking at so cold? 
 All I ever? 
 I guess I will be seeing no open? 
 Don't you see they have a problem with me 
 It's all... guy 
 It's all ? to let it go 
 Too late I won't board this plane 
 It's all... guy 
 It's all ? to let it go 
 Too late I won't board this plane 
 I don't want to wait 
 I don't wait to wait 
 I don't want this way 
 I don't want this way 
 Why are walking around girl speaking to me 
 I thought you promised to speak your mind 
 Are you really... know what happened last weak 
 Or... have been affected your mind 
 You stay with an angry face 
 The situation got out of hand 
 Do you want me to go or stay 
 I guess I won't be seeing? 
 Got a problem with me 
 It's all... guy 
 It's all ? to let it go 
 Too late I won't board this plane 
 It's all... guy 
 It's all ? to let it go 
 Too late I won't board this plane 
 I don't want to wait 
 I don't wait to wait 
 I don't want this way 
 I don't want this way
