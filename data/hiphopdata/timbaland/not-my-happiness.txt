My happiness don't belong to me, it belongs to others 
 My happiness don't belong to me, it belongs to others 
 Will it make me happy to give it away, hey, hey, hey 
 Will it make me happy to give it away, hey, hey, hey 
 Jesus gave his life for us, so I can't i? 
 My bone had not a savage one, my heart multiplies 
 My character speaks for itself, does it have to rot? 
 I?mma a geek doing what I'm doing 
 For the geek's made happy itself 
 Oh, oh 
 My happiness don't belong to me, it belongs to others 
 My happiness don't belong to me, it belongs to others 
 Will it make me happy to give it away, hey, hey, hey 
 Will it make me happy to give it away, hey, hey, hey 
 If I stay around just? 
 I don't worship well anything 
 It means nothing when you're down 
 I try to keep up this... 
 While I keep my burdens inside 
 I?mma keep doing what I'm doing 
 Cause it keeps me satisfied 
 My happiness don't belong to me, it belongs to others 
 My happiness don't belong to me, it belongs to others 
 Will it make me happy to give it away, hey, hey, hey 
 Will it make me happy to give it away, hey, hey, hey 
 Oh, oh, oh, my happiness don't belong to me
