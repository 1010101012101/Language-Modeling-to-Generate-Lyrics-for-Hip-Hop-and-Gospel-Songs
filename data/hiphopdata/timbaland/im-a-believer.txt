Put your hands up 
 Everybody put your hands up 
 Put your hands up 
 (1st Verse) 
 The world's so cold and my own damn hart is making fun of me 
 Don't need a miracle to see tomorrow's right in front of me 
 I'm on my own, and nobody knows who we can come to be 
 So come allong, you never know the weak is set free 
 (Brigde and Chorus) 
 Now close my eyes, and I run to you ah 
 Can't close my hart, 'cause I know the truth ah 
 'Cause I'm a believer 
 We need a believer 
 Know I gotta believe ah 
 Any believe ah 
 'Cause I'm a believer 
 (2x) I'm a believer 
 (2x) we need a believer 
 (2nd Verse) 
 Is there one so bold, I would raise a hand and join a good fight 
 There's a legend told, someone's gonna show us what it looks like 
 'Cause if you are there, you never know who it could be 
 You could come or hold and lead us to love that we believe 
 (Brigde and Chorus) 
 Then I close my eyes and I run to you 
 Can't close my hart 'cause I know the truth 
 'Cause I'm a believer 
 We need a believer 
 Know I gotta believe ah 
 Any believe ah 
 'Cause I'm a believer 
 (2x) I'm a believer 
 (2x) we need a believer 
 'Cause I'm a believer 
 We need a believer 
 Know I gotta believe ah 
 Any believe ah 
 'Cause I'm a believer 
 (2x) I'm a believer 
 (2x) we need a believer
