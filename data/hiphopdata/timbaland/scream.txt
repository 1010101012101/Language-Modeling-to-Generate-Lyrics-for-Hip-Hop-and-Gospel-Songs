Timbaland 
 I got a plan for you and I. 
 Let's journey across the Venetian skies. 
 Keri Hilson 
 Can I have some of your cookies? 
 Timbaland 
 Can I have some of your pie? 
 May I cut the first slice, so won't you... 
 Keri Hilson 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right. 
 Keri Hilson 
 Intoxicated with desire. 
 And you're the designated driver, yeah. 
 I'm not afraid, 'cause I'm a rider, yeah. 
 Ain't nothing wrong with feeling right, so won't you... 
 Keri Hilson 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right

 Nicole Scherzinger 
 I love it baby, got me here doing things I don't ever do 
 You hold me down, that's why I'm here making sure things are up for you 
 Get it like a getaway, when the lights go off, you turn on 
 I love your place, 'cause I can hear the echo when you make me... 
 Keri Hilson 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right. 
 Keri Hilson 
 In the car, at the party 
 Got his hands on your body 
 Don't fight it, oh 
 If you like it, oh. 
 In your room, on the rooftop 
 Feels good, don't stop 
 Don't fight it, oh 
 If you like it, oh 
 Why don't you... 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right 
 Scream at the top of your lungs, if your body's feeling right. 
 Timbaland 
 Uh, if you love me girl, why don't you...? 
 If it feels good, why don't you...? 
 Keri Hilson 
 Sing it. 
 Timbaland 
 Uh, if you love me girl, why don't you...? 
 Keri Hilson 
 'Cause when it feels good 
 Don't fight it, oh. 
 Timbaland 
 I ain't gon' fight it. 
 Keri Hilson 
 If you like it, oh. 
 Timbaland 
 Ha.

 Keri Hilson 
 Don't fight it, oh. 
 Timbaland

 Keri Hilson 
 If you like it, oh. 
 Timbaland 
 Break. 
 Don't you like that? 
 It feels so good, don't it? 
 Grab my hand, baby. 
 Let's take a walk on the beach. 
 Let's clear our minds. 
 Hold your screaming here. 
 Don't you like that beat? 
 You do? 
 What else you like? 
 Hmm, I can accommodate that, hmm. 
 Oh you like my swagger? Hmm. 
 You like how I changed it up? 
 I like it too, baby. 
 But for now, I think the beat is going a little bit too long. 
 Oh, you like it this long? Hmm. 
 That means you like to make love long. 
 Yeah I feel that oh. 
 I like how you shaking your hips to it. 
 It's about to end baby, but don't you stop. 
 Keep it going, keep it going, keep it going. 
 Bring it over here. 
 Sit on my lap. 
 Kiss me. 
 No right here. 
 Yeah. 
 Huh. 
 Oh I like that. 
 Oh I like that. 
 Oh. 
 I'm gonna stop bullshittin'.
