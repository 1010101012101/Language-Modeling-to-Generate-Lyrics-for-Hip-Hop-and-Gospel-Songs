Timbaland 
 I got a feeling she keeps me in the dark 
 I gotta keep my eye on her, she ain't no walk in the park 
 I'd offer this but she wants that, she she she want it all 
 You see she wanted to paint the picture and say she my broad 
 I got a little tip from the word on the block, people sayin' I shouldn't get involved 
 But I didn't judge or try to change her cause you are who you are 
 I'm like a drug she's addicted to me, she can't leave me now 
 She always makin' plans to date, come and find me tomorrow, good-bye girl 
 Justin and Adam 
 She's too invested on the hours that pass her by 
 I'd pay attention if I thought it was worth the time 
 I tell her easy but her hands they find a way 
 Confusing passion for the love he never gave 
 Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance 
 Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past 
 I tell her easy but her hands they find a way 
 Confusing passion for the love he never gave 
 Timbaland 
 I couldn't get rid of shawty if wanted 
 'Cause she was down, but I was tired of playin' the role like I ain't know that she get around 
 Something about this girl fascinates me, she's the type that likes to hang with the stars 
 The way she makes me feel and sedates me, who knew we would take it this far 
 Everywhere that I try to go she got a wanted poster with my face on it 
 Soon as I walk out the door, there it is a wanted poster with my face on it 
 Can't blame myself when it's not my fault cause nothing was promised, at least I could say I 
 Was honest, goodbye girl

 Confusing passion for the love he never gave 
 Fall back on reasons that we know won't stand a chance 
 Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past 
 I tell her easy, but her hands they find a way 
 Confusing passion for the love he never gave 
 She's too invested on the hours that pass her by 
 I'd pay attention if I thought it was worth the time 
 I tell her easy, but her hands they find a way 
 Confusing passion for the love he never gave 
 Fall back on Reasons that we know won't stand a chance 
 Watching her shoulders like a memory from the past 
 I tell her easy but her hands they find a way 
 Confusing passion for the love he never gave
