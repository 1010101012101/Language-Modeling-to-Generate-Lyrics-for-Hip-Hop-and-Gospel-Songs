We don ?t even conversate, we don't even act no more We used to go out all day, but 
 Our kids are the number one 
 Chore 
 Where did the loving go, we 
 Really need to ?this far, yeah, eh 
 I swear this feels like a game 
 And I ? got the score And she say 
 Mentally I ?m gone, we believe there ?s no tomorrow, tomorrow 
 Mentally I ?m gone, we believe there ?s no tomorrow, tomorrow 
 Mentally I ?m gone, we believe there ?s no tomorrow, tomorrow 
 I reflected back home myself, 
 I think I ?m abusing this all I think I really need some help 
 Can you get counseling for 
 Baby I get it, I did, the 
 Problem's ? come talk Now that ?there ?s a problem, I hold my head up so 
 And she say 
 Mentally I ?m gone, we believe there ?s no tomorrow, tomorrow 
 I hope everyday bears out 
 Fine 
 I hope the sunshine ?s up at bay 
 I hope everyday bears out 
 Fine 
 I hope the sunshine ?s up at bay 
 I hope everyday bears out 
 Fine 
 I hope the sunshine ?s up at bay 
 I hope everyday bears out 
 Fine 
 Still keep saying 
 Mentally I ?m gone, we believe there ?s no tomorrow, tomorrow 
 Mentally I ?m gone, we believe there ?s no tomorrow, tomorrow 
 I'm gone, we believe there ?s no tomorrow, tomorrow 
 Mentally I ?m gone, we believe there ?s no tomorrow, tomorrow.
