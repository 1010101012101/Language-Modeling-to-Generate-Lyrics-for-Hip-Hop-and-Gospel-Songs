Clap ya hands everybody, if you got what it takes 
 I'm Timbo and I want you to know that these are the brakes 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh 
 Hey, get your back up off the wall 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh 
 Hey, get your back up off the wall 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh 
 Hey, get your back up off the wall 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh 
 Let me tell you 
 You got me feigning for your body parts 
 You said you lonely and you need it bad 
 Come and see me when you wanna start 
 And where we going you don't have to ask 
 Come in my sight with the blunt in the air 
 Let me seduce you, let me play in your hair 
 I see that you're hyper, let's take it upstairs 
 Hey girl! Let's have a meeting, a meeting 
 I know a quiet place where we can talk 
 Girl, relax and let me do my thing 
 Baby I don't wanna to break your heart 
 I just want to make you say my name 
 Come in my sight with the blun in the air 
 Let me seduce you, let me play in your hair 
 I see that you're hyper, let's take it upstairs 
 Hey girl! Let's have a meeting, a meeting 
 I'm a chick nigga 
 Heart with a man? fo' sho' 
 In the back of my mind, girl you infidel 
 Even though you a skunk?, I'm a fan of chest 
 Role play you the best, you supply the sex 
 Yes, I'm a feign of your hoe 
 One hit of you, when I lose control 
 I look in your eyes, I can see your soul 
 Bankroll in the hoe for you to cause and go 
 Come in my sight with the blunt in the air 
 Let me seduce you, let me play in your hair 
 I see that you're hyper, let's take it upstairs 
 Hey girl! Let's have a meeting, a meeting 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh 
 Get your back up off the wall 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh 
 Hey! Get your back up off the wall 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh 
 Get your back up off the wall 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh.
