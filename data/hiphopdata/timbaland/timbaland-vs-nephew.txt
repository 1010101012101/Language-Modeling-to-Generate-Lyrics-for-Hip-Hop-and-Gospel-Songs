I ain't got no money 
 I ain't got no car to take you on a date (aha) 
 I can't even buy you flowers 
 But together we could be the perfect soulmates (aha) 
 Talk to me girl 
 (Oh) Baby, it's all right now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me 
 If we go dutch you can still touch my love, it's free 
 We can work without the perks just you and me 
 Thug it out till we get it right 
 Baby if you strip, you can get a tip 
 'Cause I like you just the way you are 
 I'm Scandinavian, everything is what it is 
 I don't need the G's or the car keys 
 Boy I like you just the way you are 
 I'm Scandinavian everything is free 
 I ain't got no Visa 
 I ain't got no Red American Express (aha) 
 We can't go nowhere exotic 
 It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best (aha)
