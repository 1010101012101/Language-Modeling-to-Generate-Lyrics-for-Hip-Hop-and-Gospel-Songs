Timbaland 
 What's somebody like you 
 Doin' in a place like this? 
 Say, did you come alone 
 Or did you bring all your friends? 
 Say what's your name? What are you drinking? 
 I think I know what are you thinking. 
 Baby, what's your sign? Tell me yours, and I'll tell you mine. 
 Say, what's somebody like you doin' in a place like this?

 Do you come here much? 
 I swear I've seen your face before, before 
 Hope you don't see me blush 
 But I can't help but want you more, more 
 Baby, tell me what's your story? I ain't shy, don't you worry 
 I'm flirting with my eyes, I wanna leave with you tonight 
 Do you come here much? I've gotta see your face some more 
 Some more 'cause baby
