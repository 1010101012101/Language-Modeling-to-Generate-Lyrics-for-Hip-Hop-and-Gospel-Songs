I don, t wanna talk now 
 I don, t wanna hear you scream no more 
 Want somebody to save me 
 Everything I do feels like its wrong 
 All we do is fall down 
 Even though we try to stay afloat 
 I swear it's gonna kill me 
 Even though you think it won't 
 So why rock a boat and make waves 
 And everything, s coming okay 
 So why am I confused if you love me 
 Thought this would be smooth sailing 
 'Cause I don, t wanna let you go 
 And we, re caught in the undertow 
 'Cause I ain, t losing my control 
 And we, re caught in the undertow 
 I hold the prayer is all our own 
 But we need air we go alone 
 'Cause I don, t wanna let you go 
 Till we, re caught in the undertow 
 I don, t wanna cry every time we try it never fails 
 Change the illusion wanna be close set for sail 
 My hearts in your hand don, t you go hurt me again 
 All we got is one chance and its sink or swim 
 So why rock a boat and make waves 
 And everything, s coming okay 
 Why am I confused if you love me 
 Thought this would be smooth sailing 
 'Cause I don, t wanna let you go 
 And we, re caught in the undertow 
 'Cause I ain, t losing my control 
 And we, re caught in the undertow 
 I hold the prayer is all our own 
 But we need air we go alone 
 'Cause I don, t wanna let you go 
 Till we, re caught in the undertow 
 And the world is rising 
 And the world is rising 
 And the world is rising 
 And the world is rising 
 'Cause I don, t wanna let you go 
 Through the crowd in the undertow 
 And I, m losing my control 
 Through the crowd in the undertow 
 And I don, t wanna let you go 
 But we, re caught in the undertow 
 And I, m losing my control 
 Though we, re caught in the undertow 
 Our only prayer is all our own 
 We both need air we go alone 
 Our only prayer is on our own 
 We both need air we go alone 
 'Cause I don, t wanna let you go 
 I don, t wanna let you go 
 'Cause we, re caught in the undertow
