Money 
 Let me show you boy, are you ready? 
 Fantasy (oh) it could be (oh) good 'n' we 
 (I was just thinkin' about you... n me) 
 Wildest thing, (you have) ever dreamed boy 
 (So what will it be?) 
 Just lookin' at you shorty lights a flame inside 
 I'm wonderin if you can come and help put out the fire, 
 That you create in me, baby, tell me what you like 
 'Cause I can be your all boy, I can be your love toy 
 If you ain't busy baby, I'm all yours tonight, 
 Let imagination take us further than the mind 
 We travellin' a dream we can bring something to life, 
 That no one's ever seen yet, can I 
 Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy, 
 It could be so good and we... 
 Might just get it hotter than the 
 Wildest thang, you have ever dreamed boy 
 Let me show you what it's like beyond your fantasy, 
 It could be so good and we... 
 Might just get it hotter than the 
 Wildest thang, you have ever dreamed boy 
 Just think of all the tasty things that we can try, 
 The come up you can have will be more than Money can buy 
 We ain't even gotta keep it quiet, boy all my walls are sound proof, 
 I can scream your name through, 
 My entire house, we will not disturb, 
 None of these old neighbors, you'll get all that you deserve, 
 Boy I got this on deck if you can conjure up the nerve, 
 To come see what if feels like, can I... 
 Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy oh, 
 It could be so good and we... 
 Might just get it hotter than the 
 Wildest thang, you have ever dreamed boy 
 Let me show you what it's like beyond your fantasy, 
 It could be so good and we... 
 Might just get it hotter than the 
 Wildest thang, you have ever dreamed boy 
 Touch it, touch it, feel it, roll around in it, if you like, 
 Taste it, taste it, and embrace it again a second time, 
 Don't you waste it, you'll regret it, cause it can satisfy, 
 Any fantasy that you can come with, can I... 
 Show you what it's like beyond your fantasy oh 
 It could be so good if we... 
 Might just get it hotter than the 
 Wildest thang, you have ever dreamed boy 
 Let me show you what it's like beyond your fantasy, 
 It could be so good and we... 
 Might just get it hotter than the 
 Wildest thang, you have ever dreamed boy 
 Let me show you what it's like beyond your fantasy, 
 It could be so good and we... 
 Might just get it hotter than the 
 Wildest thang, you have ever dreamed boy.
