Timbaland: 
 Do you like it? Uh, uh, uh, what 
 Do you want it? Uh, uh, uh, what 
 Do you like it? Uh, uh, uh, what 
 Do you want it? Uh, uh, uh, say what, here we go 
 Do you like it? Uh, uh, uh, what, here we go 
 Do you want it? Uh, uh, uh, what, here we go 
 Do you like it? Uh, uh, uh, what, here we go 
 Do you want it? Part two, part two 
 Bassey: 
 Why you always askin' me why I talk like that? 
 What, you think you better, nigga, 'cause your pockets are fat? 
 Excuse me? But wasn't I the one that you meant? 
 Talkin' trash to these niggas 'bout to dent up they whip 
 You know me and I don't think I have to explain 
 You that same crotty nigga that fucked that bitch in my Range 
 You're all the same, like to talk up a good game 
 Between the money and the pussy, that's you're claim to fame 
 Timbaland: 
 Look at you, talkin', tellin' all the bullcrap lies 
 It was you who made me put my hand on your thigh? 
 Never ever was the one that humped that girl on your Rover 
 You forgot your baby cousin humped that girl on your Rover 
 It's Timbaland, baby, I don't get down like that 
 Don't try to explain, get yo' ass to the back 
 Never ever disrepsect the man that put you on his team 
 Now, baby dove, get the keys to your Beem' 
 Timbaland: 
 Why you talkin' big trash to me? 
 Bassy: 
 'Cause you always playin' games, Timothy 
 Timbaland: 
 Why you tryin' to make me bad, baby 
 Bassy:

 Timbaland: 
 Why you tryin' to make me bad, baby 
 Bassey: 
 Because you always playin' games with Bassey 
 Bassey: 
 I done met many players that act like you 
 Think because they spend some money that I'm ready to screw 
 Instead of talkin', 'Hit me up around the 1st and the 5th' 
 'Cause you rot in a crumbed out six, you think I'm whipped 
 Got numerous niggas that be rottin' my shit 
 And the last thing I need is a nigga for kicks 
 I stay dibbed and forever spend the louchie on Gucci 
 Fuck the money and the diamonds, 'cause, nigga, I'm still shinin' 
 Timbaland: 
 Look at you, girl, talkin' trash 
 Talkin' trash, actin' grown, show your ass 
 Don't try to get on my track and clown 
 You my queen, my mistress, my Jackie Brown 
 Why you tryin' to start trouble in my can? 
 Now hot and angry and I'm getting amped 
 Keep on givin' me the cold shoulder 
 Now I got to get the keys to the Roller 
 You gone 
 Timbaland:

 Bassey: 
 It was all for the paper, that's right, all for the love 
 Only wanted most what most ghetto girls dream of 
 I need the Hummers and the yachts, Don P on the rocks 
 Cartier wrist-wear with the shivel on top 
 Then you lace me, now you hate me, now you tryin' to replace me 
 Had a woman when you dated me, I guess I was crazy (know you was crazy) 
 Tried to play me but your game's a little lazy 
 'Cause I hooked up and got with your man, nigga scrammed 
 Timbaland: 
 Girl, what you know about Cartier wrist wear? 
 When you don't even wear Vic's underwear 
 Think before you start talkin' shit 
 Remember, I'm the man with the diamonds and whips 
 I ain't tryin' to beg, but a legend like those speedos 
 I ain't gon' get mad if you hump one of my people 
 I keep tellin' you this is me you talkin' to 
 Talkin' trash won't get you nowhere, baby boo 
 Timbaland: 
 Why you talkin' big trash to me?
