(Timbaland) 
 Hey, I was mean (mean) 
 Before I became a feen 
 I took over the world when they gave me a beep machine 
 And then I made my city jump (jump) 
 It's your favorite producer, come on baby let it bump (bump) 
 I'm like a music cyclone when I'm in the zone 
 I typhoon every time I get on a song 
 I *tie coo?* I just went and brought another home 
 Who you stuntin on? 
 I'm never off, I set it off, and you were never on 
 What's there to care about? People know my whereabouts 
 Anywhere I want, private jet in and out 
 Whip brand new, you know what Tim about 
 Ferrari 5-99 Windows Tinted out 
 I-I-I'm the man m-my beats is crazy 
 You want my sounds, you gotta pay me 
 But don't get it confused, never had no silver spoon 
 But you got a long walk, tryna fit Timbaland's shoes 
 And next up (I believe that's me) 
 And what's your name (D.O.E. on the M-I-C) 
 And where you from (NYC, we up in here G) 
 Why don't you get on the mic for the symphony? 
 (D.O.E.) 
 Ok, ok when you see me roll through (Yup) 
 Got the whole crew Timbaland he produce 
 If you a fruit, Produce 
 Riding in a old school (pimpen) like I'm poss to 
 She French kiss my d*** and then I told her Merci buques 
 (Put it in the bag) Nah baby I ain't Fab 
 When I f*** ya it's a wrap, I'ma put you in the cab 
 Better be happy I rap, if I wasn't I'd be strapped with the (mass) 
 And I... and I'm coming for your stash 
 When I find out where you at I'll be (shimmying ya lock) 
 Get the f*** up outta ya baby, you betta (gimme what you got) 
 Wit you **** money **** money ****money ****money 
 Lying like there's no money (Uh) Gotta go money 
 Pockets feeling drained then it's back to snatching chains and I 
 (Wish a n***a run up on me, he gon find the heat, and make the wrong move) 
 I ain't changed, still the same 
 D.O.E be the name, I'm from North Side Queens 
 Next up (Ha, hey I believe that's me) 
 And what's ya name (Bran' Nu a.k.a Brandy) 
 And where you from (Mississippi but was raised in Cali) 
 Why don't you get on the mic for the symphony? 
 (Bran' Nu) 
 I got it, I got it (Ha) 
 It's been a long time comin' 
 I'm back like I forgot something important 
 Can't have a problem with me 
 I fade it to black like church slacks 
 Now I'm in the Range, no Cadillac 
 So you don't want it with me 
 I'm on the tip of your tongue like bubble gum 
 I got your head sprung 
 It's my return (Like the Kingdom Come) 
 I'm taking off like a rocket 
 I got this beat in my pocket 
 I keep your heart droppin' (and you...) 
 Never gonna hold me back, Timbo put me on the map 
 Now you wanna say I act (Brand New) 
 Just like my Proda boots, struttin like a model do 
 Don't you wish you had another (Chance to) 
 Get up under my skin, frontin' like you g-g-g-get it 
 You keep runnin' ya mouth like them broads do 
 I gotta learn you, like a school do 
 'Cause clearly you don't have a clue 
 So next up (Yeah, hey I believe that's me) 
 And what's ya name (Attitude on the M-I-C) 
 And where you from (Alabama we up in here G) 
 Why don't you get on the mic for the symphony... 
 (Attitude) 
 Ok, ****(not understandable) 
 Never mediocre 
 Plenty bread so you know I gotta keep a toasta 
 On my side b***h ride unless she a Oprah 
 B***h I'm too fly to drive, I'ma need a chauffeur 
 I get a whole lot of h*** like a G supposed ta 
 They could put me in the FED for what's in my sofa 
 Rap **** wack slap 'em if they say ya hard 
 Diss me, I'll up the ratchet on you and your A&R 
 I know they mad never thought that it could happen 
 Got my **** on then I hopped in a Austan 
 Every check I cash in, bigger than the last one 
 Met a new freak, she thicker than the last one 
 Nah, I don't love her homey, MUSIC is my passion 
 I don't show compassion 
 And all my B***hs yellin' I'm the s***, even when nobodies askin 
 Boy I'm on fire like the **** at the ****in 
 That's why I stay so gone playa 
 F*** *****in up the ozone laya 
 I drop a hit every time I got some s*** to say, 
 And if I miss I come back like a richochet
