Timbaland 
 I'm head over heels for someone I 
 That I really can't deal with 
 I want to block her out my mind 
 But I really can't do it 
 I tell myself this the last time 
 I'mma let her do this to me 
 Whenever we do spend time 
 I realize that I can't get enough of you 
 Patrick Stump & (Timbaland) 
 Wipe that smile off your fucking face 
 (Then I say to you) Wipe that smile off your face 
 (Then I say to you) Wipe that smile off your fucking face 
 (Then I say to you) Wipe that smile off your face 
 Patrick Stump 
 To be despised, to be loved 
 To be dreamt of, to be sought 
 From the inside, I don't care 
 Right in the middle 
 I'm right in the middle 
 To be despised, to be loved 
 To be dreamt of, to be sought 
 From the inside, I don't care 
 Be my unholy 
 My one and my only 
 Patrick Stump 
 I wear scarves and hoods 
 'Cause they're the only poker face that I've got left 
 And everything I love about you is a mess 
 Smash the mirror and break the palm reader's hand 
 I want to be better than I am 
 Patrick Stump & (Timbaland) 
 (Then I say to you) Wipe that smile off your fucking face 
 (Then I say to you) Wipe that smile off your face 
 (Then I say to you) Wipe that smile off your fucking face 
 (Then I say to you) Wipe that smile off your face 
 Patrick Stump 
 To be despised, to be loved 
 To be dreamt of, to be sought 
 From the inside, I don't care 
 Right in the middle 
 I'm right in the middle 
 To be despised, to be loved 
 To be dreamt of, to be sought 
 From the inside, I don't care 
 Be my unholy 
 My one and my only 
 Timbaland 
 Girl, just look what you've done 
 How could you do this to me 
 I gotta put my foot down 
 I can't let you do this to me 
 I can't forget those good ol' times 
 And all the things you've been doing to me 
 I wanna hit that one more time 
 I'm in love, what you're doing to me 
 I'mma say it loud, right here 
 Let's fuck in this crowd 
 Why we arguing 
 I thought me and you were supposed to be 
 Friends 
 Let's chill for a minute 
 Better yet, we need to heal for a minute 
 Baby, put down the knife 
 Sometime I wanna save your life 
 But I'm cool 
 Patrick Stump 
 To be despised, to be loved 
 To be dreamt of, to be sought 
 From the inside, I don't care 
 Right in the middle 
 I'm right in the middle 
 To be despised, to be loved 
 To be dreamt of, to be sought 
 From the inside, I don't care 
 Be my unholy 
 My one and my only 
 We don't got no fuckin' band 
 We ain't got no speakers, no fuckin' microphones set up 
 Timberland, son of a bitch 
 Just get the fuck outta my house now 
 'Fore I get too mad and I can't turn back 
 Hey 
 Didn't I say get the fuck out 
 Get the fuck out 
 Hahaha
