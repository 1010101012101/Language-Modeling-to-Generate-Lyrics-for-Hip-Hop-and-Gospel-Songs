 Tell your boyfriend he better mind his business, 'fore he end up in the trunk of my Bentley 
 I am still a boss, he can't hit me, he ain't got enough paper to deal wit' me 
 Baby girl wanna 2 step wit' me, turn around rub your ass up against me 
 Whoa, little mama done got titsy, and then tonight, tomorrow you're history 
 All you haters wit' that hoe shit miss me, I stay strapped security don't frisk me

 Sorry I'm so demandin', but save the dancin', for back at the mansion and 
 Ain't this money handsome? Ain't that a panty anthem?

 Missy Elliott 
 Hold up! Hell naw! Like 
 Britney Spears

 In the club I drink it up, gulp gulp drink it up 
 Got Patron sippin' in my cup, that's your man I bet I can make him look 
 When he see the jugs he wanna rush and get a quick... 
 Mmm-hmm, thick legs, big ol' jugs, legs stick like rims on the truck 
 Take him to the crib, yep, we gon' fuck, and you can call me a freak I like to get buck 
 I don't have to do much to make you get it up 
 Sum Yung Ho, she worth $2, I'm worth more dollars that make a beauty parlors

 Only rich girls, we only buy the bottles 
 And like a porn star I'm best when I swallow
