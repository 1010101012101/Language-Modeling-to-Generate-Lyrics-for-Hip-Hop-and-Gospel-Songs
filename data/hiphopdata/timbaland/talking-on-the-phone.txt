 (Kelly - Verse One) 
 I trusted her, my home girl from school (yeah yeah) 
 Introduced her to my man, they became cool (uh) 
 She told me that, that he loved me so (wah wah wah wah) 
 I shoulda known she liked him all along (yo) 
 They were 
 Talking on the phone (talking on the phone) 
 Gotta get your own (you gotta get your own man) 
 Leave my man alone (and leave my man alone) 
 Callin' him on the phone 
 (Kelly - Verse Two) 
 Don't hate a girl, 'cause they too slick 
 They smile in my face, all on my man's (oh... ficky ficky) 
 You don't know what, what I've been through

 (Kelly) 
 Don't hate a girl, 'cause they too slick 
 They smile in my face, all on my man's (oh... ficky ficky) 
 You don't know what, what I've been through

 Talking on the phone (I'm feeling quite good right now) 
 Talking on the phone (but it's time for me to take my spaceship to another 
 Level) 
 Talking on the phone ('cause right now I don't think the world is ready for 
 Timbaland) 
 Ta-ta-talking on the phone (I'm on that next level, can you dig it) 
 Ta-ta-talking on the phone (can you dig it) 
 Ta-ta-talking on the phone (I don't think so) 
 (Alien)
