(Missy Elliot) 
 I'm on that next shit 
 I'm on that next shit 
 You on that old shit 
 I'm on that next shit 
 (Verse 1: Missy Elliot) 
 I got a figure eight figure, lookin' more bigger 
 Never booty shots, ass look thicker, ass jack tripper 
 I dance like stripper, been hot since Billy Dee was drinking malt liquor 
 I rock a beat like wooh, other chicks can boo like they at the Apollo 
 I get it crazy for you baby, been rapping since y'all was lil' babies 
 You better respect moi, voulez-vous coucher, yes moi 
 No I can't be stopped, might see me down the street in a brand new car 
 Now if y'all ain't on this new shit right now 
 Now y'all gon' have to find a new beat, new beat? 
 Now y'all on this new shit right here, take your clothes off in the VIP 
 (Chorus: Timbaland/Missy) 
 Take clothes off, take clothes off, oh 
 I take my clothes off, I take my clothes off, let's go 
 To the flo', take it off, to the flo', take it off 
 To the flo', take it off, to the flo', take it off 
 (Verse 2: Missy) 
 Allow me to reintroduce myself, my name Miss 
 Rocking like no one else,? I don't need y'all 'cause I'm feeling myself 
 Haters y'all just be worried to death 
 Like a throw back, to the flow back 
 Return of the Mac, go 'head take my Kodak 
 I'm all that, ya ain't know that 
 You can't keep track if you had a low jack 
 Yeap, must of thought I was over 
 Been hot before Michael Jackson wore loafers? (say what?) 
 Ya' was youngin, I was much older 
 Been rich before you even knew about Oprah 
 Before you knew about Oprah 
 Been rich before you knew about Oprah, haha, get it? 
 Been rich before you even knew about Oprah 
 Take clothes off 
 In the VIP, watch me take my clothes off 
 To the flo' now, go and take your clothes off 
 Hey, take your clothes off
