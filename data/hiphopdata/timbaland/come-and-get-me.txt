Bean boy 
 Uh, nigga, your time is up, I ain't come to kid you 
 I knew you niggas was dumb, but how dumb is you 
 Thinkin' you can see the King when you unofficial? 
 You don't wanna go to war 'cause I'll launch these missiles 
 I'm a ride or die nigga, I be tearin' shit up 
 We ain't like them other fools who don't compare to us 
 All the hoes love a nigga, they be backing it up 
 But me? I love money. I be stacking it up 
 When my bandwagon pull up, they hop on board 
 They hop right on mine and hop right off yours 
 I get respect, homie, all across the board 
 I get a quarter-mil a track without an award 
 Ever wanna test a nigga, then come see me 
 In the street, I hold my ground like I'm concrete 
 I know shit ain't sweet so when shit get deep 
 I'm rich, I can pay to have you six feet deep, nigga 
 I give it to whoever want it 
 If you want it, come see me 
 You know where I'm at if you want it 
 If you want it, come get me 
 I give it to whoever want it 
 If you want it, come see me 
 You know where I'm at if you want it 
 If you want it, come get me 
 50 Cent 
 Yeah Nigga, you violate. I regulate, rat-tat-tat-tat 
 Bigger shells they fit in that Banana Clip Tech 
 Run and a bullseye form on your back 
 It's hard to miss wit' a full clip in the Mac 
 I got ammo, ammo, I unload, reload 
 Cut a nigga quick. Yeah, my knife game lethal 
 That tough guy shit, nigga that's what I see through 
 You like a 3-course-meal, muthafucker, I eat you 
 You food and I'm in the mood, so front I let the hammer fly 
 Nigga, you can duck, run for cover, or die 
 Your choice, you choose 
 I pop, you move, like you in shock you been shot 
 Nigga, your blood on the street, you up Shit's Creek 
 You can hardly speak, startin' to get weak, your eyes close 
 Your life flash, your heart slow, your heart stop 
 Your ass dead, you fucked, kid 
 I give it to whoever want it 
 If you want it, come see me 
 You know where I'm at if you want it 
 If you want it, come get me 
 I give it to whoever want it 
 If you want it, come see me 
 You know where I'm at if you want it 
 If you want it, come get me 
 Tony Yayo 
 I'm like Nicholas Cage, Yay' is the Ghost Rider 
 P89, yeah, I let my toast slide, Costa Rica to Brazil 
 I got my hoes in the leer, why your bitch bald-headed 
 Like Britney Spears, I'm in the Projects, gettin' dope and piff money 
 Two more flips, that's Anna Nicole Smith money, fuck a G4 
 I'm in a G500, G450, G550, that's airplane talk 
 I'm the aviator man, baby AR shoot your baby out your hands 
 Spaghetti and corn bread, mix got me blunted, 
 There's no talk abouts. she don't fuck on an empty stomach 
 Buy out the mall, then hug the block, hundred thou wood grain 
 In a Phantom Drop, then I cruise in the club 
 Got my Ruge in the club, pay a bouncer a buck 
 Now my You's in the club, yeah nigga 
 I give it to whoever want it 
 If you want it, come see me 
 You know where I'm at if you want it

 You know where I'm at if you want it 
 If you want it, come get me.
