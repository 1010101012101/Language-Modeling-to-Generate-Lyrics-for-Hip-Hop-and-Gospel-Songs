 My baby girl is waiting in my bedroom at home for me 
 Another girl is waiting in the hotel alone for me 
 What's going on I'm dead wrong maybe I ain't right for her 
 And when I get home the only thing I'ma hear all night from her is 
 You lied (you crazy) 
 You cheated (you crazy) 
 And you ain't got one good reason (you crazy) 
 Be glad you breathing (you crazy) 
 You ain't gon' cheat on me no more (ah) 
 You lied (you crazy) 
 You cheated (you crazy) 
 And you ain't got one good reason (you crazy) 
 Watch your back and I mean it (you crazy) 
 You ain't gon' cheat on me no more 
 You crazy girl 
 Why you talking all bad about me baby 
 I'm pretty sure that you can't live life without me baby 
 You wanna call me names 
 When I try to leave then you come after me 
 You're saying crazy things 
 Why you throwing stuff baby you're scratching me 
 You lied (you crazy) 
 You cheated (you crazy) 
 And you ain't got one good reason (you crazy) 
 Be glad you breathing (you crazy) 
 You ain't gon' cheat on me no more (ah) 
 You lied (you crazy) 
 You cheated (you crazy) 
 And you ain't got one good reason (you crazy) 
 Watch your back and I mean it (you crazy) 
 You ain't gon' cheat on me no more 
 Think I'm crazy now 
 You really don't wanna see me explode 
 I'm like a time bomb 
 Watching every move and I'm waiting to blow 
 Remember the last time 
 You begged me to stay when I wanted to go 
 Now do it again 
 It's going down like you never seen before 'cause 
 I know I'm convinced you've been on the prowl 
 Remember payback's a bitch 
 You know three's a crowd 
 You lied (you crazy) 
 You cheated (you crazy) 
 And you ain't got one good reason (you crazy) 
 Be glad you breathing (you crazy) 
 You ain't gon' cheat on me no more (ah) 
 You lied (you crazy) 
 You cheated (you crazy) 
 And you ain't got one good reason (you crazy) 
 Watch your back and I mean it (you crazy) 
 You ain't gon' cheat on me no more 
 You lied (you crazy) 
 You cheated (you crazy) 
 And you ain't got one good reason (you crazy) 
 Be glad you breathing (you crazy) 
 You ain't gon' cheat on me no more (ah) 
 You lied (you crazy) 
 You cheated (you crazy) 
 And you ain't got one good reason (you crazy) 
 Watch your back and I mean it (you crazy) 
 You ain't gon' cheat on me no more
