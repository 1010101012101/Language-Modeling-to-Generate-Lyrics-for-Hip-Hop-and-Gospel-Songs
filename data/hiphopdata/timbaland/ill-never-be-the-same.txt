What is somebody like you doing in a place like this? 
 Say did you come alone or did you bring all your friends? 
 Say what's your name, what are you drinking 
 Think I know what are you thinking 
 Baby what's your sign tell me yours and ill tell you mine 
 Say what is someone like you doing in a place like this? 
 I'll never be the same if we ever meet again 
 Won't let you get away 
 This free fall's got me so 
 Kiss me all night don't ever let me go 
 I'll never be the same if we ever meet again 
 Do you come here much? I swear I've seen your face before 
 Hope you don't see me blush but I can't help but want you more more 
 Baby tell me what's your story I ain't shy don't you worry 
 I'm flirting with my eyes, wanna leave with you tonight 
 Do you come here much? I've gotta see your face some more 
 (Some more cause baby I) 
 If we ever meet again 
 I'll have so much more to say 
 If we ever meet again 
 I won't let you go away 
 If we ever meet again 
 I'll have so much more to say 
 If we ever meet again 
 This free fall's got me so kiss me so oh 
 This night, don't ever let me go 
 I'll never be the same if we ever meet again
