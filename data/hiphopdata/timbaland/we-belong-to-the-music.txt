Timbaland: 
 Come on Y'all, Come on Y'all, Come on Y'all. 
 Miley Cyrus: 
 Put Yo' hands out. 
 Timbaland: 
 Miley, Miley, Miley... 
 Miley Cyrus: 
 I'm gonna put on my dancin' shoes 
 And find a crazy outfit 
 'Cause tonight it's all about you 
 I can't wait to show you all my new moves 
 I got a brand new 2 step 
 You gonna like this outfit 
 I got y'all right here 
 No need for you to go anywhere 
 Turn it up until you can't rock anymore 
 Mr. DJ, look at what you made me do out on the floor 
 That's what we say. 
 (Chorus: Miley Cyrus) 
 Hey, Hey 
 We Belong To The Music 
 We don't answer to you 
 Hey, Hey 
 That's right we ain't movin' 
 We don't answer to you 
 It's a party we can dance if we want to 
 Come on and party like it ain't no curfew 
 Hey, Hey 
 We Belong To The Music 
 We don't answer to you. 
 Miley Cyrus: 
 I'm gonna call up my friends 
 Gonna have a good time 
 It's sure to be crazy 
 Tonight, it's all about us 
 Feelin' real good can you blame me. 
 I got a brand new hair-do 
 With my brand new attitude 
 You can tell me ain't nothin' to hide 
 I'm laughin' out I'm tellin' you tellin' you 
 Turn it up until you can't rock anymore 
 Mr. DJ, look at what you made me do out on the floor 
 That's what we say. 
 (Chorus: Miley Cyrus) 
 Hey, Hey 
 We Belong To The Music 
 We don't answer to you 
 Hey, Hey 
 That's right we ain't movin' 
 We don't answer to you 
 It's a party we can dance if we want to 
 Come on and party like it ain't no curfew 
 Hey, Hey 
 We Belong To The Music 
 We don't answer to you.
