OneRepublic: 
 For those days we felt like a mistake 
 Those times when loves what you hate 
 Somehow 
 We keep marchin on 
 For those nights that I couldn't be there, 
 I've made it harder to know that you know 
 That somehow 
 We'll keep movin' on 
 There's so many wars we fought 
 There's so many things we're not 
 But with what we have 
 I promise you that 
 We're marchin' on 
 We're marchin' on 
 There's so many wars we fought 
 There's so many things we're not 
 But with what we have 
 I promise you that 
 We're marchin' on 
 We're marchin' on 
 Timbaland: 
 So many hills we had to climb 
 Almost without our strength 
 But we kept 
 Slowly marchin on 
 Time heals the wounds we couldn't close 
 Blood sweat and tears dried up 
 We're okay 
 We kept marchin on 
 OneRepublic and Timbaland: 
 There's so many wars we fought 
 There's so many things we're not 
 But with what we have 
 I promise you that 
 We're marchin' on 
 We're marchin' on 
 There's so many wars we fought 
 There's so many things we're not 
 But with what we have 
 I promise you that 
 We're marchin' on 
 We're marchin' on 
 Timbaland: 
 Get your legs and walk 
 'Cause we're not too far 
 A little more to go 
 But we're marchin on 
 We marchin on 
 We marchin on 
 We marchin on 
 We marchin 
 If we lose the sun we couldn't deny that 
 If we go the wind we gotta fight back 
 But we marchin on 
 We marchin on 
 We marchin on 
 We marchin 
 The bridges are gone 
 And we're almost home 
 The end is close 
 OneRepublic and Timbaland: 
 There's so many wars we fought 
 There's so many things we're not 
 But with what we have 
 I promise you that 
 We're marchin' on 
 We're marchin' on 
 There's so many wars we fought 
 There's so many things we're not 
 But with what we have 
 I promise you that 
 We're marchin' on 
 We're marchin' on
