Give it up... we gon' show, you how we party 
 [Timbaland (whispering)] up jumps da boogie (repeat 3x) 
 (Repeat all 4x) 
 Verse one: magoo 
 I fiend for all beats, like girls jump for dicks 
 Don't salt the next man, keep that lindbergh shit 
 Up in the cut, like gay niggaz, in butt 
 I'm black wit Indian, my race should be mutt 
 I cut with razor blades, play spades with aunt Venus 
 E-valuate this rap, take heed a fuckin' genius 
 Up in the sky, up high, don't puff lye 
 Do you smoke crack sam? prepare to fuckin' die 
 Fuck crazy joe, my name is crazy flow 
 You thought I had eight, but I got ten mo' 
 Off beat and on beat, old school like beat street 
 I stink like pop's feet, make sweat wit no heat 
 Verse two: timbaland 
 I'm up on this track, like pam grier in movies 
 I heats up the beat, like water in a jacuzzi 
 I fly to l.a., then come back to virginia 
 Then call, maganoo, to see if he's got some indo 
 Then back to the crib to pick up my brother, g 
 G don't forget, to bring the house keys 
 Hops in the eight, five-oh now here we go 
 Please please, brother don't slam my car do' 
 It costs too much money to get that shit fixed 
 I need all my money to pay my bills with 
 Don't have no time, for the shuckin and jivin 
 Peep my rhyme, cause that, shit's off-timin 
 Verse three: missy 
 I'm in the marriott, the place to get got 
 After I smoke pot, he sticks me like shots 
 Funky like farts, connect tongues like dots 
 Lick his lollipop, this kid named scott 
 Me my hot self, my self be so hot 
 Touch my hot spot, I scream till I can't stop 
 Uh (what, what?) 
 Give it to me daddy and 
 Uh (what, what?) 
 Yup, yup like teddy 
 Teddy, ready with tha one two checka 
 No diggity, missy be the bedroom wrecka 
 Double decka, make you wanna beat your pecka 
 And then leave your bitch, cause this uh! be better 
 Chorus: everybody 
 Give it up! 
 Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps me (repeat 4x) 
 Give it up! we gon' show, you how we party 
 Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps me (repeat 2x) 
 Give it up! we gon' show, you how we party 
 Verse four: magoo 
 Prepare to get wet, like jheri curl juice 
 You tight like virgin pussy, my rap get you loose 
 I bump like ac-ne, take honey from a bee 
 My style is like a safe, without da fuckin' key 
 I cum 'cause I'm a nut, don't bleed when I'm cut 
 No fan of madonna, she just a damn slut 
 So sit you damn dog, and bow to my shit 
 Nit-wit you stupid, I'm butter don't need grits 
 Make fits like seizure, lick clit to please ya 
 I book then read ya, follow da leader 
 Like jews and Chinese, I own your rap lease 
 The wackness must cease, prepare for yo' release 
 Verse five: timbaland 
 I'm up in these labels tryin' to, handle my business 
 Been makin' more beats before, jehovah had witness 
 Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps me 
 Brother brother, please, turn on the TV 
 See a black man dead, from a white man's powder 
 See a white man scared, from a black man's power 
 Back to reality, please don't freakin smile at me 
 This is a stick-up, so give up yo' wallet please 
 Verse six: missy 
 I'm the best, and that's b, and that's capital 
 I hang low like testicles, MC's wanna copy these many flows 
 Hoes, better back up, foe they get slapped up 
 Pack up and go tell mommy, that I backed up you 
 You you you, and your whole screw 
 What, whatcha whatcha whatcha gon' do uh, what whatcha gon' do 
 To me, the m-i-double s-y-e 
 Wanna battle me, it's gonna be some tragedy 
 Chorus: everybody 
 Give it up! we gon' show, you how we party 
 Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps me (repeat 4x) 
 (Repeat all 2x) 
 Give it up! we gon' show, you how we party 
 (Repeat to fade)
