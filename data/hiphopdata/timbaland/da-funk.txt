Uh Check out the flava 
 I got you strung out like Kayta 
 Catch me on ??? 
 Just can not fate her 
 Later for all you whack MC's 
 Claim to be my friend 
 But really my enemy (me me me) 
 Why you want to mess with me 
 'Cause I got Mentalor 
 I'll mess you up like that lady in Mallas 
 That's childish 
 'Cause I'm on another level 
 Uh universal-cology on the f-in-devel 
 Uh bring the shovel 
 'Cause I'm bout to dig your grave 
 Not a lady but I call Mad Rage 
 On stage 
 Stick of you like ... Dan Cage 
 'Cause I'm doin' this my way 
 I don't know 
 You been told 
 About that funk 
 Bass control 
 Dat Funk baby dat funk 
 Dat Funk baby dat funk 
 (Repeat) 
 Magoo what's up my *nigga* 
 Do you want this girl with this fine figure 
 Get with her 
 After that then we trick her 
 Then get her drunk off the Thunderbird Liquor 
 Then video tape her like that man did on Slipper 
 If she acts up dismiss her (what what what) 
 I hope she don't think we acting hard 
 'Cause we in with the mayor and that big boy Sarge 
 Ain't that large 
 They will say it will be that 
 With Timberland and that Maganoo sound now 
 You must go through initiation 
 Bad situation 
 Like a brother on a plantation 
 Time is wasting 
 Catch me on location 
 On your funky radio station 
 Da Funk Da Funk 
 (Repeating funk through the chorus) 
 1,2 1,2 where ya gonna run to 
 When I come through when you start acting brand new 
 I'm like a maniac when I do my track 
 I doubt it if my beats will be whack 
 Play like Sylvester and leave me Stallone 
 'Cause I'm gonna find your girl and make her moan (what) 
 Make her get on and on (on and on on on on and on) 
 Now I got this far 
 I'm a smooth black brother so I paid off the star 
 Hot now I'm gone with the quickness 
 It's a damn shame I am so relentless 
 I'm the crazy thriller 
 I slap the F off Farina and then took his Miller 
 I like (I like) 
 'Cause I'm right 
 Old tight (wont tight) 
 Riight 
 Chorus almost to the end 
 "Da Funk" is repeated till the end
