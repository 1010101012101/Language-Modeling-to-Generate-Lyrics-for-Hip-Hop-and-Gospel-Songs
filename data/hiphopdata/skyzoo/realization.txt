Playing middle ground, hoping this middle counts 
 And if don't, hoping I can keep my middle down 
 Fingering triggers at a dream if they sniff one out 
 Guess this aroma's gonn' kill me now any how, any means 
 Catching finish lines in a quicker reach 
 Yves Saint Laurent helped 'em get to get me 
 We just made it all and it's all just the centerpiece 
 Playing middle ground like if this is what it gets to be 
 Being that we on, tryin' to be on one 
 They might add another by the time that we all done 
 I be saying we 'cause if it's me, it's all us 
 I be saying me 'cause if it's we, it's all hush 
 I did it off of lust until they fell in love 
 Hustle from the heart, whatever be your drug 
 And then you realize if they never let you run 
 You'd be right where you was tryin' to be beside 
 From the jump and then you realize 
 I've realized that I feel like I'm so blind 'til I'm on my own 
 And I realize that this seems like the only way to go tonight 
 It's underneath you when you looking up 
 Never concerned 'cause you never had to look for trust 
 Left it to burn when you left it for that look of love 
 Until your hustle unhook a plug 
 More than a hustle if every word that I uttered 
 Was for the better of us like nothing could ever cut us 
 Whatever could become us was waiting past aim 
 Good stadium numbers, famous last name 
 Seated in a dream but playing musical chairs 
 And seeing who you be just gave proof to me there 
 The proof in is the air, you was who you was 'fore I got there 
 Hope your last name don't drop there 
 In it for the win 'til it's said and done, laced up to let it run 
 Spraining ACL's, more steps to come 
 And then you realize if they never let you run 
 You'd be right where you was tryin' to be beside 
 From the jump and then you realize 
 I've realized that I feel like I'm so blind 'til I'm on my own 
 And I realize that this seems like the only way to go tonight 
 Fingering triggers at a dream if they sniff one out 
 Guess this aroma's gonn' kill me now 
 Anyhow, still I'm down for whatever be 
 Always said I'll stay awake if I ever dream
