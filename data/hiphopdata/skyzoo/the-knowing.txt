Fitted like you're in front of a step and repeat 
 I'm listening to everyone tryin' to get you to leave 
 When they finished I'm over here, letting you breathe 
 And my fitted is all gray if you check underneath 
 Meaning, I'm on that side, opposites attract, right? 
 And I'm attracted to getting rid of your past like 
 Everything you need, you believe and you react like 
 No one ever did this, they had you underprivileged 
 'Cause you was in your mirror for a reason though 
 6 for them murder heel's, I'm guessing you keeping those 
 Keeping those means you'll be breaking them in around the Stuy 
 The truth will pro'lly get you a win, I'm not surprised 
 They making you wanna leave, I got you thinking to stay 
 I'm here to get in your talk, they here to get in your way 
 I'm here to be what they wasn't, here to be why you love it 
 Hearing me got you buzzing but scared to give me a play 
 I knew it, you feel like you know me 
 So you don't wanna leave here and feel like you owe me 
 I already knew it, you feel like you know me 
 You holding back just as much as you wanna show me 
 See the thing about it is 
 I don't know what it is but I wanna find out 
 Why am I feeling like 
 I know you, I know you, I know you, yeah, I swear 
 Your friends tell you let it go 
 Like, "Yeah, he fly but he'll never do the X and O's" 
 Maybe they're right or maybe they have yet to know 
 Maybe tomorrow when we wake up you can tell 'em though 
 Pardon me but I be knowing, baby, I be knowing 
 And you looking like you ain't looking for nothing they be throwing, right? 
 I agree, so when you tryin' to leave 
 Say the word and I'll follow words and follow leads 
 However it gotta be as long as you get to live a little 
 Henny straight, I promise you it'll benefit you 
 Feeling like you wanna see if it can get you there 
 Balmain mini dress, let it disappear 
 In your ear with the opposite of the man before me 
 I got no game its just some women understand my story 
 I'm with it if you wit it 
 And drive back prepping you for all that you been missing 
 I knew it, you feel like you know me 
 So you don't wanna leave here and feel like you owe me 
 I already knew it, you feel like you know me 
 You holding back just as much as you wanna show me 
 I swear that I know you, what you saying I already know 
 As much as I know you I still wanna hear mo' 
 I swear that I know you but I'm still all yours 
 I swear that I know you, I know you, I know you, yeah, I swear
