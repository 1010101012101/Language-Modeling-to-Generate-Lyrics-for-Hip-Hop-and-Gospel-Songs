Sittin' in the essence of it all, seated better than before 
 My autograph resembles the sketches on the wall 
 To blindly put a bid in and never to withdraw 
 What it brings is what it brings, it's whatever when it's drawn 
 Underlings wanting rings, it's like catching a reward 
 Far as I know, having money never did me wrong 
 So forgive me for the motive of exposing my exposure 
 The opening of me was the way of giving me closure 
 I told 'em on the one, to be the one is to be lonesome 
 And opening the trunk was their way of turning my tone up 
 Y'all'll get potentially when you growed up 
 Big paws on a small pup like fuck the hold ups 
 I'm more for the immediate when all they see is medians 
 I'm over the shoulders of the norm for the deviant 
 I'm know that it's going up beyond from your previous 
 Peeking through the floor at the above like where the ceiling went? 
 Oh, there it go, better yet, there it was 
 I heard whistles as much as y'all try to hear the drums 
 So miss me with the wonderings and the whys 
 These grapes wouldn't fit no wonder, I don't reply 
 They say God bless the child like I hold his own 
 You pay blogs to hold you down, I just throw 'em my poems 
 And they Olajuwon posts, I'm honored by the most 
 Hidden they face when they tryin' to find the dope 
 See this is just a test drive 
 So tell 'em I ain't sittin' where the rest ride 
 Shorty say I'm whippin' like I'm next right 
 I'm just tryin' to figure out my next drive 
 See baby, this is just a test drive 
 So tell 'em I ain't sittin' where the rest ride 
 Shorty say I'm whippin' like I'm next right 
 I'm just tryin' to figure out my next drive 
 Games fucked up 
 Dudes beats is banging, dude your hooks did it 
 Your lyrics didn't, your blogger look, did it 
 So I would, write it if y'all could, envision 
 What was real from what's distilled 
 And the good, difference between 
 The two of 'em, easy to bow out and be through with him 
 But realizing they still write off how I influence him 
 Made me never mind like I'm Francis pops 
 Said it smell like teen spirit when you stand on my block 
 Aspiration, corners employed that handle hard 
 O's on they mind, it's looking like Camden Yards, I mean 
 With Stoudamires for hire the man in charge 
 And more of them in training just look to the handlebars 
 I handle bars for the broads that speak light 
 Made her scream to be quiet, I guess I'ma leap right 
 Am I right, is this what they said it would seem like? 
 And if so I wouldn't wrote what I wrote by them street lights 
 I mean humble pie on a plate, it's set behind me 
 'Cause hustle said it best, I'm just better than everybody 
 So whaddup chi town, anytime thatchall out 
 Visiting the borough you good as long as I'm round 
 'Cause I was in the chi and y'all treated me 
 Like I was Tomahawkin with a 1 on my back for the south side 
 So when we at the table and them bottles come close 
 Just now that that teen spirit corner deserves a toast 
 And I'll toast with myself if it don't seem comprehensible 
 Tippin' my fitted to my mirror, the commendable 
 I been what I talk since December 24th 
 And from then on I never had to pretend to you 
 See this is just a test drive 
 So tell 'em I ain't sittin' where the rest ride 
 Shorty say I'm whippin' like I'm next right 
 I'm just tryin' to figure out my next drive 
 See baby, this is just a test drive 
 So tell 'em I ain't sittin' where the rest ride 
 Shorty say I'm whippin' like I'm next right 
 I'm just tryin' to figure out my next drive
