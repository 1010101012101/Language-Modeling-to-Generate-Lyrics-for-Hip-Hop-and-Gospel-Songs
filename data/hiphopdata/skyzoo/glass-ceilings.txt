Figure it's a clock, work orange, how I'm pardoned wit the top of it 
 Leave it up to me to see the bottomless, bottom is 
 Meaning what the moral or the object of the riding is 
 Told 'em all before, no Radames, riding with 
 All or nothing now, couple dreams in a duffle 
 Damier's all around it, guess a dream might run you 
 And the run's a 100 yarder, the dash mite barter 
 And you tryin' to shake a Dash like a Carter 
 I'm tryin' to play the back as a starter, the irony in that 
 Wanting all of it but wanting no part of the react 
 I react like all we ever wanted was to be up 
 Nobody could guard us but regardless they should lead us? 
 Still playing ringer, told me chill while they king him 
 Background live or die, they can still raise a finger 
 Those around us can see the same tent 
 Windex the roof, it only makes sense 
 It's all glass ceilings, all glass ceilings 
 Tryin' to see whatever, all for that feeling 
 High enough to let up, low enough to feel it 
 Probably forever blowing through the ceiling 
 Looking for it 'til it's all said 
 And then it feels like when they killed Cornbread 
 Or Cochise or Voletta's son 
 The common thread? It's pro'lly better if you never run 
 Or find a ledge that you can level if they ever come 
 I'm 'bout this bread, God bless you if I'm ever shunned 
 Say I took it just the way that I was taught to 
 You wait and you'll be laid when they applaud you 
 You say that if I lost you there's nothing left to seek out 
 I say that if I lost you, you wasn't supposed to be found 
 So we out, we out, outside living like this 
 Outside living wasn't out the side limits 
 Or living like the roof up above us wasn't loose enough to touch us 
 Mu'fuckas wasn't true enough to love us 
 And all of those around us can see the same tent 
 Windex the roof, it only makes sense 
 It's all glass ceilings, all glass ceilings 
 Tryin' to see whatever, all for that feeling 
 High enough to let up, low enough to feel it 
 Probably forever blowing through the ceiling 
 Big money in my sentence 
 Sleep ain't what it was, it come a little different 
 If we can't cover up then cut a little distance 
 Each and everyone of us just want it how we live it 
 Big money in my sentence 
 Sleep ain't what it was, it come a little different 
 If we can't cover up then cut a little distance 
 Each and everyone of us just want it how we live it 
 It's all glass ceilings, all glass ceilings 
 Tryin' to see whatever, all for that feeling 
 High enough to let up, low enough to feel it 
 Probably forever blowing through the ceiling
