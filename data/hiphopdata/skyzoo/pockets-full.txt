How they talking it but ain't living it? 
 That Spade pop, I'm sipping it, made mine deliberate 
 Made mine in remembrance of a couple of doors down 
 'Cause when you neighbors wit the greatest, your applause sounds 
 Madison Square like I rap for where it's like 
 If nothing else is saving you then packaging squares might 
 They told me that I got it to Basquiat it 
 Brought you so close to it you thought you was buying product 
 Vividly I, forefront 'em when they sit on the sides 
 I gave 'em Linderella stories and the city obliged 
 I'm in a city of Gods and needles and Foamposites 
 Singing line for the line and see how this dope got us 
 Arms length, jeeps with dark tents, Damier Louis shit 
 Tisa's in all prints for the desire of everything, they deny us 
 They ask to define us tell 'em dreaming's the problem 
 So if you see us anywhere its pockets full 
 Pockets full, pockets full of now 
 So know that if we down 
 We'll be down till we counting all around 
 And counting till we out, tell 'em pockets full 
 My pockets was empty till I flipped and tripled my profit 
 I'm similar to Skyzoo, attempted to sky rocket 
 Posted by them benches serving them smokers 
 That buy product as hopeless as I had it 
 Not bragging, but baby, I made it out the city 
 Where them people will bang flamers and double back 
 Clap and shoot your dame in the same evening 
 Your city ain't wild as ours, Philly raise heathens 
 Y'all city raise divas like Billy Ray Cyrus 
 Freezer count cheese, get green like I'm Irish 
 Flow wavy, I'm about to set seas like a pirate 
 Call the navy up, tell 'em Team Early up, wilding 
 I ain't talking 'bout the drink when I say its hypnotic 
 These rappers far from goblins and they're not goons 
 And when I'm flowing on the beat the pocket's full 
 Used to post up on the street, tell 'em cop and move 
 Now I bully booths, I got a lot to prove 
 Tell them fools my pockets full 
 Pockets full, pockets full of now 
 So know that if we down 
 We'll be down till we counting all around 
 And counting till we out, tell 'em pockets full 
 We grew up singing, keep your eyes open 
 And your wallet in your front pocket 
 Riding along gave us one option 
 Riding along to the drum knocking like yeah, the drums got this 
 And God forbid if the drums stopping 
 But if they ever do then all we ever knew 
 Was so for real we can hand 'em what we've yet to lose 
 Soul for real baby, candy coated residue 
 And know the drill if them cameras ever get to you 
 Fuck it, we on tho
