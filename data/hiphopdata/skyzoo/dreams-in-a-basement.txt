It's quiet here, yeah, I like to come here 
 It's lonesome, you know what's whack? 
 When I'm down with the posse or at home and shit 
 And everybody be screaming and yelling and shit 
 It gets real lonesome 
 It be like crowded and noise and screaming 
 And suddenly it feels like I'm the only one there 
 The more people there is, the lonelier it get 
 I have this dream, yeah, like what? 
 Nothing, sometimes I have it, that's all 
 Celebrating the win, celebrate what it meant 
 Do remember and celebrate it again 
 Right, newly winners, we celebrate where it went 
 And sewn different, we celebrating the hem 
 Right, you sing along you celebrating the hymn 
 Bet 'em to prove me wrong you'll be celebrating their end 
 Tell 'em it's crew first, we celebrating with kin 
 And fuck an E for effort, don't celebrate the attempt 
 My attempt be, everything the rent be 
 Call it hand in hand but a hand can't be empty 
 So I was in the basement sparring wit complacency 
 And my weaving got me off when it would tempt me 
 Sofa beds and dealing wit being better than all that you listen to 
 And feeling like it's whatever as long as it get to you 
 For the nod and the doze and the open yawn 
 Shit is beyond what they hope, tell 'em no regards 
 Sometimes, I wonder will I ever sleep the same 
 'Cause I, I let these dreams keep me awake 
 Said I need more, I just need more 
 'Cause I need more, said I need more so I dream 
 For all the Grand Aves, all the Merrick and Lindens 
 All the Fulton streets, forever we did it 
 May we never forget it, nor what it took to be it 
 And for the taking when we take it like it took repeating 
 They took to me and I took 'em home 
 I shouldered all of it, brave enough to look alone 
 Looking through blinds tryin' to look for time, counting to hook a line 
 Tryin' to serve what you deserve but still cooking mine 
 Pint of Hennessy, tryin' to write a memory 
 Live it and forget it like tonight was like the end of me 
 Right, in a basement loaded with ambition 
 Smothered by it they wanna eye it but can't listen 
 Sleeping wit the cousin of sleep and her hands vivid 
 Turn for the win but most of 'em can't pivot 
 For the nod and the doze and the open yawn 
 Shit is beyond what they hope, tell 'em no regards 
 Sometimes, I wonder will I ever sleep the same 
 'Cause I, I let these dreams keep me awake 
 Said I need more, I just need more 
 'Cause I need more, said I need more so I dream 
 For the sleepers and for the dreamers 
 For the awake and everything that's between 'em 
 For the awake and everything they believe in 
 And when believing ain't enough, I be up 
 I be up on the other side where the others tried 
 For the other ride or otherwise 
 Otherwise I'll be sleeping here with y'all 
 But dreaming ain't enough so if sleeping is involved 
 I'll be up on the other side where the others tried 
 For the other ride, otherwise, dreaming ain't enough so I'll be up
