Growing up, project struck, looking for luck, dreaming 
 Me and couplets, I was cupping up to the ceiling 
 Sseen it, jumped in and was looking up to believe it, lived it 
 Went and penned it and left the rest to the speakers 
 Wrote it the way I know it, you heard it, you saw me show it 
 Outlining the obvi' and intricating below it 
 Dollar signs in the lobby and finger painting the motive 
 Any side that's beside me is giving way to the notice 
 Dare you to look away from it, counting it is weighing it 
 And the weight of the winners will build 'em to build a gate for it 
 Protect it or neglect it, skully over the face with it 
 The outcome surrounds them and everything they praying with 
 Dents in the carpet, the honor amongst saving it 
 Picturing tomorrow is pro'lly gon' make today the end 
 Beat tapes blur out the blue and all the chase in them 
 Lights out the window, the awakening 
 I'm feeling like I made it though and if I made it yo 
 Then making it is everywhere that they ain't say to go 
 I'm making it where all of this is for the taking yo 
 'Cause making it is everything that they been waiting fo' 
 I show 'em how to make it through hysteria 
 Make it through hysteria, make it through hysteria 
 Made it through, show 'em how 
 Know the sound, know the score well enough to quote it now 
 Used to what they used to see them pointing the composer out 
 Suitor of the suitors, double breasted, money folded down 
 Rooted where the root is found an exit they can go around 
 Sped you up to slow you down, fuck the curiosity 
 1,000 thread count but I was cut from where the bottom be 
 Powder spread 'round like they was dumping out their lottery 
 Freshened up the linen like embellishing an image 
 See it's sorta like the scene where Dukie get out the car 
 And Prezbo is watching a dream die from afar 
 And testers are getting thrown over on Popular Grove 
 And the rest of what you know is where the end of it starts 
 You hear the engine is gone, behind you is what it was 
 Hearing tends to be wrong but reminds you of what it does 
 Hearing it through the walls, oblige and get your run 
 And make sure to rewind it when you're done 
 I'm feeling like I made it though and if I made it yo 
 Then making it is everywhere that they ain't say to go 
 I'm making it where all of this is for the taking yo 
 'Cause making it is everything that they been waiting fo' 
 I show 'em how to make it through hysteria 
 Make it through hysteria, make it through hysteria 
 Made it through, show 'em how 
 Word to the hysteria that we tryin' to say we made it through 
 And word to bringing everyone wit us to say, "Shit I made it too" 
 Whatever happens from here on out 
 I made it when they said I wouldn't make it 
 I made it and I made it true 
 No hand outs used because none were ever given 
 I mean I can't say I wouldn't have accepted 
 If a hand was ever risen but none were so 
 Why consider when they didn't 
 They didn't consider my city or my block 
 Or my curb or my crib the way I did 
 And I didn't do any of this just to say I lived 
 I did it to say I'm in, in for whatever it might've been 
 Or it might be, or whatever's likely to push through 
 Not a hero just a good dude 
 Moms and pops love me like cooked food 
 And the front door was wide enough 
 For me to do more than just look through 
 So hey, why not at least take a stare? 
 Take it a step further and take it there 
 I mean really take it there 
 And see what all the fuss is being made about 
 And admire the ones before us who made it out 
 Getting autographs and picturing all of that 
 As a blueprint for us and wishing for all of that 
 Uh, see when I said I wrote on the back of light bills 
 I really meant that 
 And whether you did or didn't get that 
 It is what it is 
 I mean it is what it is for that dream 
 And that dream is so vivid it don't even look like one or so it seems 
 Seems to us that whatever you leave for us is what it'll be for us 
 But fuck that because if that don't be enough 
 Then what does that mean for us? 
 Confliction and contemplation and addiction 
 And that itching and itching for what you missing 
 And you inching to see what they taking 
 Or see what they paying 
 Or see both sides and see why the song's been playing 
 The way it's been playing 
 And why it won't stop, couldn't stop it if you tried to 
 Or better yet if you pretended you wasn't listening 
 When really you knew every word in every sentence 
 And every metronome in that rhythm 
 Every hi hat and 808 you was given 
 The bass you know as well as the mirror you in front of 
 And well, either do it or don't but either or they can't judge us 
 So yeah, I wrote and I wrote because no one else spoke 
 No judge, no jury, just purely how it goes 
 And from the go I was who I am 
 The story's been one in the same just the way 
 That you turn that page may have changed 
 Long time coming since Chris or Shawn 
 Or Nasir or Corey or Brad first started to go 
 Figured I'd do my part and draw up a path 
 And let it unfold, unfold like kites with picture requests 
 And homecoming dates and liquor requests 
 And shit, I stand tall for all of it if this is what's left 
 Buying bottles last minute 
 'Cause see I'll never forget the date 
 But I might forget the request, see my life's loaded at the moment 
 And there's so many bottles to be bought that 
 I kinda get lost but still here and feeling like I made it though
