Well if you listen, you're learnin', the money I'm earnin' 
 I'm from hollis queens and not from mt. vernon 
 People all over the place, I'm tellin' you now 
 It's guaranteed for treble and bass, and showin' you how 
 To kick out rhymes like a blizzard kicks snow 
 'Cause my name is young MC, the boy that's good to go 
 'Cause I'm rough like hunter, clever like macguyver 
 Rock the mic 24/7 don't spit saliva 
 Cold like ice and hot like fire 
 Givin' you a shock like a plug and a wire 
 'Cause people go crazy when the mic's in my hand 
 'Cause I'm like robocop and you're a regular man 
 My rhymes are mine and not stolen, the mic that I'm holdin' 
 You told me some rhymes that was weak so I was rollin' 
 Around on the ground 'cause it was so damn funny 
 Don't call me honey, no you never make no money 
 My rhymes are written, fresh and never bitten 
 I'm standing, you are sittin', you hear me and then you're quittin' 
 You're out of the game, nobody knows your name 
 And your claim to fame is that you show no shame 
 New york to California, yes coast to coast 
 And I'm dustin' mcs like ghostbusters dust ghosts 
 I wrote a little record for the hip and the hop 
 My name is young, the record's called non stop 
 Non stop for the rhythm, non stop for the rhyme 
 Non stop for the people who are right on time 
 Non stop for the treble, non stop for the bass 
 Non stop for the brotha' who is on the case 
 I came here to prove a point and to try my best 
 To get the people on the floor in three minutes or less 
 There'll be no time for cuttin', no time for mix 
 To do in three what other rappers can't do in six 
 'Cause I was chillin' at a party, the record was playin' 
 "This is brand new", that's what the DJ was sayin' 
 But no matter what the people stand on the wall 
 They'd have more fun goin' shoppin' at a shoppin' mall 
 So then the DJ called me over to help out that night 
 He said "yo yo that's young MC", I said "yo yo that's right" 
 So then I grabbed the microphone, the party started to hop 
 'Cause when I start you know I go non stop 
 I'm ready willing and able, the mic and turntable 
 If I'm not on tour, I'm at home watchin' cable 
 I made "my name is young" and I made "let them know" 
 So on your mark, get set... here we go 
 I make the crowd go insane, don't use cocaine 
 I like to travel a lot because I travel by airplane 
 Sittin' by the window, sleepin' with a bimbo 
 Take you off your balance like your life was in limbo 
 Too hot to handle, hotter than a candle 
 Sloppy like oscar, but neat like tony randall 
 My rap is inconceivable, it's unbelievable 
 To me it's easy but to you it's unachievable 
 This is the lowdown, forget about the flow down 
 Live from new york it's a hip-hop hoedown 
 My lip service makes you nervous 
 Yo don't play dumb 'cause you know that you deserve this 
 Renegade rebel, rockin' bass, rockin' treble 
 Takin' rap to a higher echelon and level 
 Elevatin' hip-hop, let me make a pit stop 
 Yo, go tell your friends about the jam they call the non stop
