Attention, party people 
 It's an APB 
 That is an All Points Bulletin from Young MC 
 Now if you're a senior citizen or just a tike 
 Just grab a seat and pay attention as I rock the mic 
 I wrote a couple of rhymes 
 And called them Just Say No 
 Dedicated to the people who are on the go 
 And we can't help you out if you're on the brink 
 And if you listen this jam will make you think 
 If you were ever in a situation 
 Without enough time for contemplation 
 All of your friends goin' the same way 
 You feel kinda trapped 
 You don't know what to say 
 Just say no 
 'Cause better safe than sorry 
 This is for real 
 This ain't no game or folly 
 It's your life and you only got one 
 So you better do it right 
 Or it will soon be done 
 You want to be popular 
 You want to be cool 
 You want to be the one that everybody likes in school 
 You want to be everything for everyone else 
 But you better think of what you want to be for yourself 
 Everyday people livin' in the same old mess 
 It's hard to be original and not be like the rest 
 You've got to go for what you know 
 You can't afford to guess 
 And Heaven knows what would happen if you did say yes 
 So say no 
 Just say no 
 You hear me? 
 Say no 
 Just say no 
 Kids OD'ing cause the families grief 
 Over the marijuana plant and the coca leaf 
 Over a bunch of pills to try to get their thrills 
 Over a drug you shoot because you think it's cute 
 Over something you smoke 
 Man it ain't no joke 
 Over something you drink, 
 Oh, boy, why don't you think? 
 Over something you snort like you were playing a sport 
 One day you'll go too far and you'll come up short 
 Some people out there don't seem to get my point 
 Telling others crack kills while they're smoking a joint 
 Well, the point of this song is to tell you the facts 
 Some people die from smoking reefer like they die from crack 
 Not a drug in particular 
 But drugs in general 
 They're not good for you like a vitamin or a mineral 
 They come in liquid, leafs, powder, pill, and rocks 
 They'll put you six feet under on your back in a box 
 So say no 
 Just say no 
 Do you hear me? 
 Say no 
 Just say no
