Roll with the punches is what I tell 
 To people when things don't go to well 
 When you go for the gold and come back empty 
 When the ups are few and the downs are plenty 
 When you talk with the girl that you always desired 
 You busted a move but the move backfired 
 When life puts you in the little crunches 
 Don't give up 
 You've got to roll with the PUNCHES! 
 Roll it baby! 
 Work- 
 No matter what occupation 
 Any times good time for vacation 
 Everyday's the same you can't believe the monotony 
 So when the weekend comes it's like you had a lobotomy 
 You can't do a thing without the boss start yellin' 
 It wouldn't be bad if his breath wasn't smellin' 
 A good days work for a good days pay 
 But that's before uncle sam takes a portion away 
 Now alot of times you feel just like quitin' 
 But without a job your home alone sittin' 
 Checkin' the want ads for jobs to fill 
 Watchin soaps, Geraldo and Oprah, and Phil 
 My advice is to roll with with it honey 
 And soon you'll find that you'll be in the money 
 Expense accounts and three martini lunches 
 And that's what you get when you 
 Roll with the Punches 
 Roll it baby- 
 You got to roll with the punches- 
 Roll with it 
 Roll it baby- 
 Lotto 
 Take your chance for a dollar 
 If I win then I'll scream and holla 
 High on the hog is the way to be 
 And its def livinin in the lap of luxury 
 I picked 4 numbers they were all ok 
 For the 5th and 6th I used my birthday 
 But I erased my birthday and said better yet 
 I'll use the birthday of a girlie that I just met. 
 I filled out the ticket gave it a kiss for luck 
 Handed it to the agent 
 With a brand new buck 
 Went home to watch TV on a Saturday night 
 4 numbers came up and they were all all right 
 Now what happened next, nearly made me drop dead 
 It wasn't her birthday it was mine instead 
 I said next time I'll just play my hunches 
 But what the heck, I'll just roll with the punches 
 Roll with it... 
 You got to go with the flow 
 Like this... 
 Women 
 Let me tell you about em 
 Can't live with them 
 Can't live without em 
 The ones you like only seem to hate you 
 The ones you hate only seem to date you 
 Girls will often tell you 
 You come on too strong 
 You got to take it slow to make the love last long 
 But I say 
 The early bird cathces the worm 
 The late bird gets the gilrie with the two dollar perm 
 Man, that put me in dilema 
 Case in point a fly girl name Gema 
 I met this lady at a quiet place 
 About 5 years ago we were face to face 
 I stepped up to her 
 Tossed the first line 
 Like fishin' I was wishin' 
 That the girl would be mine 
 I told my best jokes and she started smilin' 
 A voice inside said yo young your stylin' 
 But then Gema really startin actin' silly 
 'Cause she broke up with her boyfriend Billie 
 She wanted advice and she was coming to me 
 I said you need dear Abby not the young MC 
 Because I don't mind being a shoulder to cry on 
 But I need one who needs a body to lie on 
 'Cause nowadays I got girls by the bunches 
 See I got smart and just rolled with the punches! 
 Roll it baby 
 You got to go with the flow 
 Roll it baby 
 Nowadays I got girls by the bunches 
 I got smart and just rolled with the punches!
