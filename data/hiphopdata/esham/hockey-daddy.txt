But ya gotta keep skatin' skatin' skatin' 
 Watch me set it off 
 Just like Sergei Federov 
 We don't give a puck 
 Detroit won the Stanley Cup 
 Call me hockey daddy 
 This one goes out to Vladi 
 Konstantinov, Joe Louis Areana 
 In a hockey town, It's goin' down 
 Skatin' on thin ice 
 Who's gonna pay the price 
 Power play, no penalties 
 Block your shot Detroit goalie 
 Just got tickets to tonight's game 
 Stood in line two hours in the rain 
 Got inside who did I see 
 Little Cesars Pizza Pizza 
 Everybody wanna see Stevie Yzerman 
 Slide that puck to the goal, like Charles Woodson and his Heiserman 
 If that don't work I can tell you one thing 
 All we gotta say is, Let's Go Red Wings 
 (Gotta keep skatin' skatin' skatin') Let's Go Red Wings (x4) 
 Let's go Red Wings, Detroit gotta win another Stanley Cup 
 If you know what's up, get up 'cause we don't give a puck 
 Skatin' (x10) 
 You gotta fight for your right to be the champions 
 Detroit Red Wings the best, we know we're number 1 
 We got what it takes to go all the way 
 We didn't come here to fight, we came to play 
 (Gotta keep skatin' skatin' skatin') Let's Go Red Wings (x4) 
 Let's Go Red Wings (x4)
