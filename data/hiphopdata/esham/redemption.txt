Oh my god you came into my life 
 And turned my world around 
 I was lost I couldn't see my sight 
 So I couldn't find my home 
 So you know I've smoked some weed 
 And took some pills and even sniffed some blow 
 And so I repent 
 'Cause all the blessings I've received I know that heavens sent 
 I never knew when I spit this shit 
 That every rapper in the world be on some wicked shit 
 It's like the first time I hit this shit 
 Say you get the shit but wont admit the shit 
 You saw me shine the sun lit this shit 
 On my knees at night askin should I quit this shit 
 When I first started we were total opposites 
 I took a stand so you can see all the hypocrites 
 Salvation for all of my sins through Jesus sacrifice 
 We live in wicked nation 
 I'm sayin' amen 'cause I don't wanna die 
 It's all about redemption 
 Everything I did and what I said 
 It's all about redemption 
 If we can forgive we can forget 
 It's all about redemption 
 It was him the devil in disguise 
 With a gun standin right before my eyes 
 He wanted my life 
 The wicked shit I speak was never meant for the weak 
 I'm runnin' out of time 
 Goin' out of my mind dodgin demons in the streets 
 God please give me a sign 
 Inherit the earth only the children of the meek 
 So if you really wanna see my soul in hell 
 This spittin' wicked shit I told the golden tale 
 My conscious catchin heat its gettin' old and stale 
 Its hard to embrace when I hold this hell 
 If you walk the bloody trail then bring your holy grail 
 The devil went after my soul but god closed the cell 
 Even though the wicked shit knows me well 
 You wont find me on the wagon when it goes to hell 
 Believe me hell is lonely 
 Believe me I was there my soul was spared 
 And don't nobody know me 
 And only he cares that's why I'm there 
 Its raining diamonds
