Now I lay me down to sleep 
 I pray the lord my soul to keep 
 And if I die before I wake 
 I pray the lord my soul to take 
 Crazy convict don't take no shit 
 Since age 13 I was ill-legitimate 
 Add a bottle of homicide crazy ass suicide 
 Suck a muthafuckin pussy dream and I died 
 Back from a hell raid done wit your dead days 
 No one listens to what the devil say 
 But I'm smooth like Satan and I was waitin 
 For another death so breath your last breath 
 I'm a psychopath crazy muthafucka laugh 
 At a funeral tell me do you know 
 Any other brother any other that can get some 
 Say his name and there'll be another victim 
 See words can't describe the pain you'll feel 
 You can't imagine it cause death's real 
 A homicidal vital recital was my title 
 Got a serious psychological problem death's my idol 
 Crucifix of tricks and black magic 
 A brotha named Esham trapped in traffic 
 The devil's my boy and Satan's my son and gun 
 Load it up and ready so that you don't want none 
 Shoot you in the back like Billy the Kid 
 Talk about takin' me out shit 
 Better put your dukes up 'fore you get fucked up 
 Crucified ya mama so what so what 
 So what you gonn' do take revenge like a brotha man 
 And get fucked up like your motha man 
 Bad ass brotha with the mind of the devil 
 Maximum over drive tryin' to stay alive 
 I sold the devil my soul for gold the story is told I'm the exorcist yo 
 Brothas and brothas who died committed suicided 
 Reel life pimped the muthafucka so another homicide 
 Fetus my trademark rhymes leave the blaze marks 
 Reel life Product. was down from the start 
 Sacrifice your life tonight wit a knife 
 Pray to hell and give the devil your life 
 See many of you muthafuckas don't understand it see 
 How long can you listen to 1 man's insanity 
 Prophecy the dead has a rosen 
 The devil is dead and 1 man is chosen 
 Believe the dead is killed blood shed 
 So much blood shed he painted the town red 
 My mind is evil evil's inside my mind 
 The devils' gonna get ya its just a matter of time 
 Go to sleep and never wake up 
 Your dreams a nightmare 
 The witch was ridin' your back I was there 
 But you was turned into stone and stuck in eternal place 
 And put you in the shadow of a dead man's face 
 666 crucifix hell's the fire on the candle sticks 
 This is the devil's groove the dance floor's bloody 
 Police you said are often as slutty 
 Go commit suiicide another homicide stupid 
 (The devil's groove) 4x 
 Now I'm rested god blessed kings 
 (Laughs until song fades)
