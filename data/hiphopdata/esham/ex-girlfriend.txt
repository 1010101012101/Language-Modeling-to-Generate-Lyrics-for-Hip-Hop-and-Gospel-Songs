I used to love her, too bad I had to put a slug through her 
 Dumped her body in the trash like I never knew her 
 Blood runnin' down the gutter into the sewer 
 Her body stunk for weeks like horse manure 
 Now the police are looking for the boyfriend, I'm the suspect 
 Forensic files, evidence, panic the public 
 Domestic abuse, custody battles, bitch made me go crazy, I had to stab her 
 Plus I didn't like her ex-boyfriend anyway 
 She never knew today would be her last day 
 When she came over, I gave her a rose 
 Then slit her throat and watch her shake until her eyes close 
 I didn't mean to (I didn't mean too) 
 I fucked up again (I didn't mean too) 
 I made a mistake and killed my ex-girlfriend (I didn't mean too) 
 Man this bitch wasn't innocent, she was guilty by far 
 Found a used jimmy hat in my car 
 And she had told me she was going to her mothers, well... 
 She can tell it to the Devil in Hell 
 I waited for the bitch to get off work the next night 
 Slapped her in the back of the head with a pipe 
 Bitch fell to the floor, bleedin out of her nose 
 I need a handsaw, a few garbage bags, and a hose 
 It wasn't premeditated, it was preaggravated 
 You think I wanted to cut this bitch up man? I hate it 
 Man, why she do me like this? When I brought this bitch chocolates too? 
 What the fuck, she's through, what are you gonna do? 
 I didn't mean to (I didn't mean too) 
 I fucked up again (I didn't mean too) 
 I made a mistake and killed my ex-girlfriend (I didn't mean too) 
 No "Hello's" just "Goodbye's" 
 You know why she had to die? 'Cause she's a liar 
 Chopped her up and threw her in the bonfire 
 But I kept her head with the transcripts read 
 Your honor I didn't kill this bitch, her family just wants to see me buried 
 Cause me and her didn't get married. Is that necessary? 
 Instead, I chopped her up and carried her head around in a bag 
 With a forty-four mag 
 Hailie's crying for her mommy 
 He didn't commit suicide, I killed your cousin, Ronnie 
 Trying to stay up out the county 
 But how can I do that with all these shady cops around me? 
 I didn't mean to (I didn't mean too) 
 I fucked up again (I didn't mean too) 
 I made a mistake and killed my ex-girlfriend (I didn't mean too)
