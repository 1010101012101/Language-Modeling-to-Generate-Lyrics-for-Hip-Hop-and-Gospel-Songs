A thug changes, and love changes 
 And best friends become strangers 
 A thug changes, and love changes 
 *Yo, uh* 
 Can it be, that I stayed away for too long? 
 Did I leave your mind when I was gone? 
 Baby ain't no need to pretend I ain't actin' live 
 I'm like a young-ass Michael from the Jackson Five (HEE HEEE) 
 But you don't feel me, the industry for years been trying to kill me 
 Me and my niggas stay in the cracks like roaches 
 Always runnin' from the Raids when the cops approaches 
 Man my style is just too ferocious 
 Been spitting potent dope for years, that's why I overdoses 
 Now I'm gonna tell you how it all began 
 Before Eminem 
 Before all of them 
 I'm a tell you how they tried to play me 
 How my city betrayed me, made me fuckin' go crazy 
 Made me carry the AK in the back with my base 
 This worlds so cold 
 I'm a let you know 
 You can't get away with tryin' to steal my flow 
 In eighty-eight I set up shop before detroit had shock 
 Kid Rock never rode a bike down my block 
 Remember Homie the Clown? 
 And that's about the time ICP put it down 
 Detroits most wanted, K-Ice and Maistro and Smiley 
 I was at the Disk, spendin' bank with Gregg Riley 
 Even though we was movin units every day 
 Still gots no love or radio play 
 Maybe because I won't pay payola 
 Known in the streets for moving yoca cola 
 Me and my brother, trying to get up out the ghetto 
 Take care of my mother, 'cause I love her 
 It was no hip hop shops or freestyle battles 
 Only a city full of snakes that rattle 
 Remember "Sugar is sugar and salt is salt" 
 If they didn't sell records, it's not my fault 
 I used to watch the scene with Natt Morris 
 I dedicate this to Detroit, now I'm a sing the chorus 
 So high you can't get over it 
 So high you can't get over it 
 So low that's why I'm holding it 
 So low that's why I'm holding it 
 Boss up 
 A real soldier learn to take orders 
 So his game is still pulled through in the fourth quarter 
 I know you can't believe that you've all been deceived 
 It's like a girl sayin' her hairs real but it's a weave 
 Feminem is a style 
 She-twelve is an age 
 She lives across 8 mile, but still can get gauged 
 Kill the fetus, please believe this, word to Jesus 
 I got niggas with the blowoff in they freezers 
 Facts is facts and fictions fictions 
 If you can't take the heat stay up out the kitchen 
 I remember droppin' Hellter Skkkelter 
 Before Devils Night, I could of burned down the shelter 
 We was bumpin Awesome Dre 
 Representing Detroit way before you meant Dr. Gay 
 All my underground niggas up at c Notes 
 Open mic spitting wicket shit that we wrote 
 There wasn't no East to West Coast 
 Just Awol, Rap Mafia, DJ Eazy B and Los. 
 This worlds so cold 
 I'm a let you know 
 You can't get away with trying to steal my flow 
 *Esham pushin the beat with his mouth in the backround*
