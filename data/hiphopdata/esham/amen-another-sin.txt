This is the beginnin' of another sin, 
 All y'all welcome to hell, 'cause my record's spinnin', 
 So many cryed 'cause the rhythm and I'm stil grinnin', 
 And I brought death to the image of Lenin. 
 Let me begin, amen for the brothers and sisters, 
 A musicial sacrifice to Esham's listeners. 
 Every time I grab the mic, 
 I leave blood stains, 
 'Cause I'm flowin' like a blood vein. 
 I'm like the devil, I flow like a creature. 
 And you wonderin', how deep can I rhyme, y'all. 
 S-I-N- as I begin a sin, 
 It would be wise to notify your next of kin. 
 Grab a mic in the moonlight, and start to recite, 
 Look me in the face when I'm rappin' and lose your sight. 
 Said I was a devil worshipper, Esham I never heard of a, 
 Sucka like you, another silent murder. 
 Killed 'em in the moonlight, listen to me recite, 
 Another sin, so here I go again, 
 Deadly notorious, I'm poisonous, 
 Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust. 
 Dead men don't sing, I bring terror like inhumaning, 
 It's a pity the devil's a human being. 
 I rap like a Gypsey, so witness a psycho one, 
 Give me a beat, I'll get unholy in a church. 
 My music is underground, a spiritual sound, 
 I got your head spinnin' like a merry go 'round. 
 Some say I escaped from a psycho ward, 
 I died when I picked up the mic, to recite, 
 Many rhymes, release the fury of a mad man, 
 666 and a mic in my hand. 
 I'm like sandman better than any on the mic today, 
 Every body grab a cross, tonight we say, Amen
