Yo, yeah, there was somthin I wanted to say, oh yeah, yo 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (when you die) 
 You can't take it wit cha 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (so give it up) 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (when you die) 
 You can't take it wit cha 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (so listen to this shit) 
 Most niggaz like money, car's, pussy ho 
 Pockets on swole roll true's and vogue's 
 You sell your soul as the story is tole 
 Just a hold on a bitch lookin' like Envogue 
 So ya slang em, gangbang em, nuts hang em 
 And bitches want the money but tricks you can't blame em 
 Got ducket's, mother fuck it, so ya stuck it 
 You either Flavor Flav it or ya chuck chuck chuck it 
 Got a big ol' house that sit on a hill 
 Gettin' high till you die 'cause that's the way you feel 
 But on the real, I don't give a fuck what you got 
 'Cause it don't mean shit when yo ass get shot 
 Why not, most niggaz plot with the gloc 
 And only gloc's go pop piggety pop pop pop 
 You just can't stop it if they comin' to get cha 
 And oh yeah, you can't take it wit cha 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (when you die) 
 You can't take it wit cha 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (none of that) 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (when you die) 
 You can't take it wit cha 
 You might get you a house, a woman, and maybe a baby 
 If you don't go crazy first 
 And tell me what's worse bein broke or a hearse (huh) 
 Money is a black man's curse, but still 
 We got to have dollar bills, 
 'Cause if I can't see it then the shit ain't real 
 Where I live, crackhead heaven 24-7 
 No hope for the city of dope 
 It ain't no heaven, god don't like my hood 
 'Cause my hood is hell and it ain't no good 
 Got money to the ceilin' oh what a feelin' 
 O.G. dealin', Caps get peeled and next 
 Ho's want checks for some sex 
 Pussy's get recked dick shoved through they neck 
 No respect, you get no respect so he hit cha 
 Snap your love like a picture 
 Ho you can't take it wit cha 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (when you die) 
 You can't take it wit cha 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (none of that) 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (when you die) 
 You can't take it wit cha 
 You can't take it wit cha, no love, no lust 
 No one, no gun, no cap to bust 
 All the things in life you've ever had 
 Get zipped and locked in the bodybag 
 What's left? Life after death, you don't know 
 When you die, you might meet the people you owe 
 Death row, that's where we all gon' go 
 Sell your soul to the devil get a tag on your toe 
 Oh no, no more bitches and television 
 Get a trip to the morgue for your final circumsision 
 What the fuck? You don't know what from what 
 'Cause they even took your dick and your nuts 
 Man you can't take it wit cha 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (when you die) 
 You can't take it wit cha 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (none of that) 
 All that shit that dope might get cha (when you die) 
 You can't take it wit cha
