 Felatio 
 Felatio 
 Felatio 
 Felatio baby 
 It feels so good yo 
 Twelve gauge 
 Road rage 
 Watch me dive right off the stage 
 Into the sea of life 
 Where you will never age 
 Body hemorage 
 Street labodomy 
 Sodomy 
 Cut the ratio 
 Female felacio 
 With my nine and still 
 I wanna fuck you like an animal 
 Hanabal 
 Straight out the bush of the jungle 
 Early mungles 
 Till the moon never fumbles 
 Sticky glue gets crumbled 
 We wanna rumble 
 All these girls and these boys 
 Lets make some noise 
 Out here you only got 1 choice 
 That's to enjoy 
 Every minute ever hour end of hour all hour 
 Thrustin through the galixy I only move foreword singin' 
 Ah-ha ah-ha singin' ah-ha ah-ha singin' ah-ha ah-ha ah-ha 
 Toys in the darkness let me spark this let me start this 
 Reguardless of viagra still the hardest rap artist microwave road rage 
 Rave back to your cave unless you be livin' in the home of the brave 
 S n m bring your mamma and her friends s n m bring all horny friends 
 Imma part of this just like you 
 Imma a diciple of natis with work to do 
 Ill bide you guide you hard to slip inside you 
 Back but I know what you want someone to hide you 
 Bump jump get it crump gang bangas love to dump 
 Down with work so watch my universal slummmpp. 
 Uh uh uh... singing ah-ha ah-ha...
