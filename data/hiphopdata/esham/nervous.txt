Nervous breakdown 
 Stress build-up 
 Um 
 And I'm paranoid 
 Skitsofrantic 
 I just think I'm God 
 I know I'm God 
 I'm God 
 I'm stressed out like a mu'fucka, hand on my heata 
 I told my bitch to get the fuck on, I don't need her 
 My mind on my money 'cause it's comin' up short 
 I just left court on child support 
 A witness to a murda but I will not tell 
 Cause most of my niggas in the county jail 
 Amphetamines make me fiend to stack cream 
 Niggas on my team be gone off scalene 
 My hair fallin' out, it's turnin' gray 'cause I'm stressed 
 The police want me dead and a warrant for my arrest 
 I can't do nothin' plus the IRS 
 Know my telephone numba and my home address 
 This nigga wanna murda me, the bitches say they hate me 
 My heart been feelin' like it bust on me lately 
 I'm gone in this muthafucka mind on loid 
 The simple situations in life, I can't avoid 
 Niggas out the murda me 
 'Cause they never heard of me 
 America's most playa hated and under rated 
 Simply stated, niggas hate it, they wanna test 
 Homie been accused of playa hatin' so confess 
 Oh my, know why, these niggas hate me so much 
 It's 'cause I can't be touched 
 I'm diabolical sinister 
 Man I murda ya minister 
 When is the narcotic 
 Reel Life Product 
 And I'm stressed out 
 Just gone 
 Stop steamin and lookin' hard 
 Stop, stop, stop steamin and lookin' hard 
 Just gone 
 Just gone 
 And I'm stressed out now 
 Stop steamin and lookin' hard 
 Stop, stop, stop steamin and lookin' hard
