Well as I step up to the mic I get the sudden urge 
 To kick the wicked shit and bust word after word 
 In a freestyle, E-style I go buck wild 
 Grab the microphone and start fuckin' up yo style 
 Well as I stick up, turn the bass kick up 
 When a microphone I pick up, you pick my dick up 
 Now it's about time for me to change my rhyme 
 And let the Unholy fuck it up one time 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y-L-Y-O-H-N-U 
 To rock a ryhme I won't pretend to 
 Next on the menu, funky rhyme descends to 
 Love the way the bass go boom on ten 
 Let me bust it, well let me bust one time or was it 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y 'cause a easy does it 
 As I bust it all the suckas wanna write what I said 
 But this one here, a just knock 'em dead 
 Well it's about time, um, it's about time 
 Well it's about time for me to drop my rhyme 
 On the lyric with the holy spirit lyrical flowa 
 Ya bitch is on my tip so I'd like to get to know her 
 I can rock a rhyme either faster or slower 
 And my rhyme's be burnin like fuckin' flame thrower 
 One for the homeboy's two for the ho's 
 Three to get ready I'm about to flow 
 I'm not a gangsta, sorta like a lyrical terror 
 The brand new funk is acid rap the new era 
 The Unholy witch and his bag of tricks 
 Nothin' that a little holy water can fix 
 You rock Esham 'cause he's the one that hit's 
 And if you don't like the Unholy poetry then suck my dick 
 This one right here a make you red in the face 
 I mean, this one right here a make your face turn red 
 But I'm knockin' 'em out, knockin' 'em down, and knockin' 'em dead 
 Well as I rock and shock the funky rhyme that's one of a kind ya bite it 
 Sucka's here my rhyme run home and re-write 
 But this time I'm rockin' rhyme's that you can't relate to 
 Rockin' beat's like this you know I'd really often hate to 
 But I gotta show this certain style's sometimes 
 'Cause I can sound fresh and my shit don't have to rhyme 
 Like, grab my bozak, you niggas the bite me 
 The people who don't like me they just jealous 
 And suck my dick and you can suck my dick too 
 If you don't like this groove motherfucker I'm still gettin' bank 
 You bought it just think, just use your head 
 'Cause I'm a slap you dick, I'm slap you with my dick 
 I'm a slap you with much dick, and just knock ya dead
