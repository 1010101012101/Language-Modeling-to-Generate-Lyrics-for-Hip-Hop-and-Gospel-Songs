(Esham) 
 Well where I snake, it's like base head 
 Brothers clock dollars, 24 sev' 
 Some get caught, and some don't 
 Some'll make big money, some won't 
 Some bite the bullet the hard way 
 Brothers play the game of death and don't know how to play 
 Money in ya pocket, can't fold, 'cause ya square 
 Every day to day, is a black man's dare 
 Money, fiends and jeasously is a big part of life 
 You thought you was the man till they stabbed you wit a knife 
 They took ya whole sack, got stabbed for a piece of crack 
 Brothers don't know how to act, watch cha back 
 They gonna get you, you better watch cha back 
 (Esham) 
 Grow up in the ghetto actin' savage 
 Vagina, smoke dope, murderous average 
 Hide ya coat in the city of dope 
 Young daughter hangin' from tree by a rope 
 You send them pound to pound, earnin nothin' but a name 
 In this pushy got thing, but it tell ya, all the same 
 Flashin cash, think that you're on top 
 But you fell to the bottom when the gun went pop 
 A bloody and nut, always had none, that's a fact 
 People don't know how to act, watch cha back 
 (Esham) 
 Walkin' down the street about twelve at night 
 Tryin' to sell rocks, but ain't a base head in sight 
 One pops up from out of nowhere 
 And then an other, and an other, and an other 
 Shoulda watch cha back like a soldier 
 I told ya, they gonna get ya, brother
