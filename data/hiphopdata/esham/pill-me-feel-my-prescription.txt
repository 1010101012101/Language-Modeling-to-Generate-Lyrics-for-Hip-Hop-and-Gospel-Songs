 Pill me for my addiction 
 Feel my prescription 
 Try everything, I've tried everything 
 Check this shit out 
 I be that Egyptian who need a prescription (So what's poppin'?) 
 Pain pills, feel my addiction 
 I'm caught up in the mix and plus I need fixin' 
 This is fact not fiction, bitch, why you bitchin' 
 Take a listen witcha ears and close ya mouth 
 Wash it down wit' some water before ya pills fall out 
 In the darkness I hear somebody call out my name 
 When I think about the past all I see is the flames 
 Angels try and save me but I'm crazy 
 They say 'Follow me' but I can't fly wit' these broken wings 
 And 'Tongues' are spoken things 
 Don't know what they mean, nightmares that I'm a dope fiend 
 Insomniac, I don't sleep, I can't dream 
 The voices say 'Follow me' the pills say 'Swallow me' 
 I gotta migraine, dead brain cells 
 Anphenamines flowin' through my veins takin' me to hell 
 Can't you tell I'm in another dimension 
 Can't you tell I'm in another dimension 
 Hell on earth and I got a life sentence 
 The only way to get to Heaven's repentance

 Pill me for my addiction, feel my prescription, baby

 I'm ya pain killa [2x] 
 I'm a pain killa, a game killa 
 The one you come to when ya need the same killa 
 Footprints in the sand walkin' witcha 
 The shadow behind you who can getcha 
 Thoughts of suicide run through my mind 
 I think about murderin' murderers all the time 
 I close my eyes and turn into vapors 
 Smokin' blunts in the Bible papers 
 My mind travels at light speed 
 Cause I speed in the fast lane swervin', my eyes bleed 
 Now let me tell you
