 Now I'm fucked up fo real still 
 This is the real mccoy 
 Still I try to tell myself it'll be all right 
 Still I try to tell myself it'll be all right

 I'm too clever ho 
 But whenever yo ass wanna play silly games wit a true blue 
 Upfront the down stroll 
 Kickin that voodoo 
 I neva had a ho I could call my own 
 I only had hos who loved to bone 
 Every nigga in the crew that didn't screw this bitch

 Blowin' out my brains for a dane

 Everybody knows the 411 
 Call 911 'cause hes got a gun 
 Now whos laughing bitch 
 Lets smoke the flat lines once the hammer clicks 
 If it sticks then I got a 666 
 Until death do us part
