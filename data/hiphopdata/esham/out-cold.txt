Now once upon a time, way back in the day 
 There was an MC-killer by the name of E-S-H-A-M 
 And he was known to murder them all 
 Gun-clapper leave a rapper brains all on the wall 
 Now, nobody coul fade him 'cause he was known to murder em 
 And kill the wack DJ's who never heard of him 
 The radio was scared, they wouldn't even listen to him 
 But he's gettin' paid, and the flash of pistols to em 
 He lives underground in parts unknown 
 He's known to take your cookies to boogie the bloody microphone 
 Seven MC's, put them in a line 
 Then add seven more niggas who think they can shine 
 Well, it'll take seven more before I'll go for mine 
 Then I'll "blocabloca" my nine rhymes at the same tizzime 
 They say, "MC-killer, don't let him rhyme around you, 
 He's bound to pull a nine and blow your mind all around you" 
 Now they got a white chalk line all around you 
 Hanging from a telephone pole's how they found you 
 Psychopathic, automatic 
 Weapons get drawn if you got some static 'cause 
 This is how the story goes 
 People these days are really out cold 
 x4 
 Great scott, a monsters high on top of the Penasca 
 Bustin' off shots with the twenty-five-shot glock 
 This is back when the wizard was cutting shit up 
 Plus ain't nobody saying nothing, so I'm shutting shit up 
 Killed another MC, scoped him from high off the tower 
 Radio stations blow out your power, sniffin powder 
 How the fuck I killed another DJ? 
 Special request: I serviced his ass with the AK 
 P-P-P-P-P-Pow muthafucka, ain't no love in my mind 
 Ain't no tarnishing my game, ain't no dulling my shine 
 Still nine dead bodies real hard to find 
 And if you want to kill some more times, press rewinD 
 This is how the story goes 
 People these days are really out cold
