Some old wicket shit 
 Some old wicket shit (for you) 
 Some old wicket shit (for you) 
 Midnight's the witches hour 
 And your outside 
 Somebody played a Reel Life Product tape 
 And committed suicide 
 Tryin' to save ya soul it can't be done 
 Unholy to the son of Satan, I ain't the one 
 Congratulations brothaz and sistaz who prayed for me 
 Some slayed for me and still pray for me 
 They say my rhyme's satanic it'll make ya vomit 
 And I think I'm the shit when it comes down to it 
 You knew it and know it, unholy poet, your mind I'll blow it 
 If you ever heard me rhyme for the first time 
 It is like a hurricane, stun you like novicane 
 Simple and plain, Reel Life Product is insane 
 Your fuckin' with the wrong one 
 Listen till the song's done 
 Fuck around and be on the wrong end of a gun son 
 Your listenin to insanity, but that's just demandin me 
 I say I'm Esham and you said how can it be 
 I'ma psycho-pathic, auto-matic 
 Reel Life Product, pro-static, fuck it. 
 Some old wicket shit 
 Some old wicket shit (for you) 
 Some old wicket shit 
 Some old wicket shit (for you) 
 Some old wicket shit 
 Some old wicket shit 
 I'm the U-N-H-O-L-Y better known as Esham 
 Champs and chumps step up and get some punk 
 Playin' around with me is like playin' with a rattlesnake 
 I shake and bake and break the fake 
 E-S-H-A-M I'm him not one of them 
 Reel Life Product's grim 
 A phsychofrantic motherfuckaz future's lookin' dim 
 A R-E-A-L a L-I-F-E a P-R-O-D to the U-C-T 
 Reel Life Product's what I spelled our very seldom yelled 
 Dope we sell 
 I have the mind of the devil, the body of lucifer 
 Gimme a mic and watch me get loose for ya 
 Convince a motherfucker that suicide's the way 
 Another homicide, I'll live another day I lied 
 I said I was the unholy, 'cause a preacher told me 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y is a brotha with soul see 
 It's written down in the god damn scriptures 
 I'm not satanic, so fuck y'all bitches. 
 Some old wicket shit 
 Some old wicket shit (for you) 
 Some old wicket shit 
 Some old wicket shit (for you) 
 Some old wicket shit 
 Some old wicket shit (for you) 
 Holy god, fuck the joy's 
 Here come Reel Life Production and the devil's groove 
 You can't move, you might as well tape it 
 And listen, and listen until it's your favorite 
 The speakers are smokin', niggaz chokin 
 I'm provokin, no jokin, motherfuckers hopin 
 That I get off the mic and shut up forever 
 But that's a dream that'll never come true, never 
 I'm insane, it's hard to maintain my mentallity 
 If you keep listenin you'll have a wicket personality 
 Fuck it.

 This is my song (for you)
