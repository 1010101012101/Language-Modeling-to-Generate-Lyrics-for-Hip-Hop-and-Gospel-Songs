Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 Time to get ill, my mic starts to kill 
 Your head is falling apart, and I start to rebuild 
 Your mind, your outta time, I'm out ya mind 
 Like a '74 the heavy metal hardcore 
 Back to the groove line 
 Suckers tried to move mine 
 The seventh sign of death, and death to the peace sign 
 I start to release mine 
 Now you gotta cease mine 
 Shot another brother for holding up the peace sign. 
 I got style, I got class 
 Try to diss me, and I'll beat your ass 
 I don't say, I spray niggaz olay 
 Like a '74, homey don't play 
 Down on the east side, my name is Esham 
 Rollin' through your hood, and I'm ticking like a time bomb 
 Ready to blow up, ready to go up side 
 Another nigga's head, for some shit, he done said 
 A homicidal killer, with a nine in my hands 
 Now you get to ride in the ambulance 
 'Cause it's murder 
 Redrum, Redrum Redrum, Redrum 
 Redrum, Redrum, Redrum, Redrum 
 Redrum, Redrum, Redrum, Redrum 
 Redrum, Redrum, Redrum, Redrum 
 Redrum! 
 Dig this, a crazy brother, on a crazy, crazy tip 
 Mother fuckers claiming raw, boy you'll get pistol whipped 
 Whipping out my mini-mag, fucking niggaz up 
 Bullet proof vest on my chest, now what's up? 
 Doing it, like a renegade 
 Sticks and stones is played 
 Who's gone get fucked up, I got a gun, you got a blade 
 I'm taking no shit, Reel Life product is legit 
 Your fiendin' for my tape, like a junkie wants a hit 
 Death is at your doorstep waiting on the one 
 The devil is in the shell, and he comin' out a gun 
 Going off on niggaz, like I just based the pipe 
 Take a nigga's life, 'cause I'm just the type 
 It's a doggie dog world, and I'm the pit bull 
 And a nigga jump crazy, bite his ass in a minute 
 I'm partners with the devil, taking nigga's on a hell raise 
 Brothers thinking, I've been dead for days 
 Beat your ass up, and leave you bleeding in the gutter 
 You said I was a sucker, your mother 
 Now your dead, with a busted head 
 No one seen or even heard of ya 
 Talking that trash, you get a busted ass 
 No one fucks with a murderer. 
 Homicide is my alias 
 Niggaz don't diss, 'cause they scared of us 
 I'm that nigga that make your nightmares come true 
 I'm not dead, but I'm death can still haunt you 
 More like Jason, but it's you I'm chasin' 
 And once I catch ya, I'm micin' and acein' 
 Runnin' through your mind like Loki 
 And the reason you don't see me, 'cause I'm low key 
 I'm the Saturday shocker, horror flick routine 
 Showin' you shit, that you never seen 
 Michael Myers, the crucifiers 
 My verse gets cursed, when worse gets worse 
 Comin' to get ya, when I hit ya done 
 Die, and go to hell, and come back as my son 
 Down on wax, with the killer tracks 
 Get so dope, I'm like a pound of crack 
 Homicide is on my side, suicide 
 Tried to get to this side, and died 
 My def jam plays like a boom, boom, boom 
 Sending out disses, to whom it may concern 
 Brothas will learn, I take no time to burn 
 I'll Murder
