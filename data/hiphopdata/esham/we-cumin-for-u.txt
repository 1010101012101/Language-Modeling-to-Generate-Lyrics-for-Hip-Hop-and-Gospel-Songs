I'm coming for you 
 I'm coming for you 
 I'm coming for you 
 I'm coming for you 
 I'm coming for you 
 I'm coming for you 
 I know you wish I was dead form the shit I be makin' up 
 Reality's nightmare, dead men don't wake up 
 In and outcha mind, flatline, straight up through the darkness 
 I'm heartless and regaurdless, the wicketness, I'ma spark dis 
 Now let me kick the wicket shit that got me paid bitch 
 Triple six, the unholy, back up boy you don't know me 
 I'll slit ya fuckin' thoat plus the murder I wrote 
 Daddy will blast for me, wicket catashrophy 
 When I got spliff wrote my name on the wall in graffiti 
 I takes from the rich and I gives to the needy 
 Punks don't know my steelo man I rock up a kilo 
 My undrstanded zero plus I'm no super hero 
 You say you want a revolution, well bitch 
 A young nigga sittin' on ammo plus I'm rich 
 The fallen angel strangled sev-er-al 
 N-A-T-A-S got federal 
 Fuck the radio and public broadcast it 
 Timothy Mcbay need to be wrapped in plastic 
 Shoot you in yo face for my mothafuckin respect 
 Judgement day in my god damn tape deck 
 I'm coming for you 
 I'm coming for you 
 I'm coming for you 
 I'm coming for you 
 I'm coming for you 
 I'm coming for you 
 I'm the wicketest demon ever bless the microphone 
 As I spit this curse, I watch ya brain burst 
 It gets worse 
 Nigga what the fuck you thought 
 For murder raps, ghost writers never get caught 
 Can't understand the spell I cast to the mass 
 I make a young nigga blast if I give 'em the task 
 I got master sterea in ya area 
 And in America, I'm bringin' the terror 
 On devils night
