The witch jumped on my back 
 So now it's time for me to rhyme in Acid Rap 
 A mic attack, so my brain starts to swell up 
 It's time to turn the volume up and raise the hell up 
 A microphone overdose, too much dope 
 Some suckaz choke but I hope they all croak 
 This is The U-N-H-O-L-Y 
 No need for applause 'cause I'm hella fly 
 I picked up the mic and get ya strung out 
 On that Acid Rap, Like a stamp, you all based out 
 Once you hit it there's no turnin' back 
 It's that Acid Hip-Hop Rap that's like crack 
 I'm gonna hit ya with another fix 
 So I added the new-improved inside the mix 
 And ya hunger like a dope fiend, off of what I did 
 I got you all strung out, on acid 
 Shoot it, smoke it, sniff it, or just listen to it 
 Some try to copy my chemistry but can't do it 
 Can't get the formula right so it's fake dope 
 Suckaz be ass-bangin' soda with benzol 
 But I'm a real nigga from the streets of Motown 
 Where Rock and Roll started, now I'm the hardest artist on the planet 
 Some can't stand it and take it for granted 
 But I always recoup and they don't understand it 
 All in my rays of more ways I daze and faze 
 And never seem to amaze the one who blazed 
 The A-C-I-D, AC-DC 
 Pump it out your system it'll blow up your battery 
 I'm a hard rock, gunnin' down brothers like Billy the Kid 
 Do what I did, now you're doin' that acid 
 You're blind, to the fact I blowin' your mind 
 Got ya all tryin' to learn my line so hit rewind 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y will take it back in time 
 In due time you'll find I flow time after time 
 I'm down for mine so stop the bitein' 
 Heard you tried to sound like me when you was recitein' 
 Thought it was a reverb of my voice but you're wrong son 
 I'm the people's choice and it's been like that from day one 
 I flow like a pro, it takes a life time to know 
 To bite my style you have to go to first 
 It gets worse as the verse lies, and attract flies 
 As I metamorphosize from Jekyll to Hyde 
 And this is for the suicidalist and Jesus Christ 
 I met Elvis in hell but who will tell the tale 
 Of everything that I did 
 Unless you put it on your tongue, and do that acid 
 This is a three minute high, or even more 
 Ya get a rush from the rhythm so even the score 
 You gotta pump it up to 10 again can I get an amen 
 It don't stop, until I say when 
 I'll make you're eardrums bleed for days 
 Acid Rap, Some treat it like coke and catch the wave 
 Niggaz be scared to listen some dared but didn't prepare so they can't 
 Some drop dead and faint 
 This is The Unholy, preachin' like a reverend 
 Except when I die I'm not goin' to heaven, yo 
 Because I write the @#%$ ya sniff 
 And when I bust on riff 'cause most niggaz can't deal with 
 What I'm sayin', some be prayin' 
 The Unholy is here to say that's how it's layin', acid
