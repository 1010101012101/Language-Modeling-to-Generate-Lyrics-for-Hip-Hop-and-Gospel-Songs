My name is Esham

 My name is Esham 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y 
 My name is Esham 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y 
 My name is Esham 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y 
 My name is Esham 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y 
 My name is Esham 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y 
 My name is Esham 
 The Devil's groove, the Devil is back 
 Esham the U-N-H-O-L-Y, right on track 
 And I'm takin' it to the max 
 (Now my religion is reality) 
 So don't ask yo Esham, what's up? Ya gotta bust one 
 U-N-H-O-L-Y load the shells to my shotgun 
 Suckas come get some from the on that hits 'em 
 Kidnap ya mind and hold it for ransom 
 Suckas are scared cause no one dared so beware 
 Ya fellas keep playin' my tape and woke up with gray hair 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y comes in for a second 
 So watch my magic tricks as I light up a candle stick 
 I'm somewhat a magician but I'm more of a witch 
 Can't pull a rabbit from my hat but I can pull a bitch 
 I pull a rhyme from my sleeve and make ya believe 
 That I'm the greatest thing alive since Adam and Eve 
 I gave life to the rhythm and I made it breath 
 And if ya scared of my performance I suggest ya leave 
 Ya see I flow wild, but meanwhile 
 Flowin is my freestyle 
 I get loose with style then I profile 
 Grab the mic and say a rhyme with no smile 
 And like a ghost I'll 
 Kick the wicked shit, some ol' wicked shit 
 Got the wicked shit to make you move 
 The Devil's groove 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y, I wrote it 
 Suckas don't sing along, you'll die if you quote it 
 Unbelievable, believe what I said 
 I got what it takes to make ya mind drop dead 
 A homocidal vital recital's what I recite 
 The suckas get suicidal inside of a mic 
 I got the crazy insane, mind of a lunatic 
 Manipulate ya mind and make ya rhyme like I'm doin' it 
 This is beyond reality, I'm no joke 
 The Unholy is in the house so smell the smoke 
 Ya choke 
 My rhyme is been bitten but your forgettin' 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y did what others didn't 
 I'm hidden 
 I'm Esham toatally unexplainable 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y inside of me is like an animal 
 Can't be caged in a rage on stage 
 As I read ya mind, I flip the page 
 As I enter ya mind I find it's dangerous 
 If I slip on a lyric I know ya brain'll bust 
 I rhyme from the stimulation of mental thinkin' 
 Some look at me as a doctor for head shrinkin' 
 Ya see I'm thinkin' that I'm more than a man 
 Somethin' more than reality, but you'll never understand 
 I entered the new wave and came with a new rhyme 
 The ones that didn't understand, got a poo mine 
 I'm still goin' through ya mind at the speed of light 
 Suckas bet ya bita chip and I know ya bite 
 It's hard to swallow, you can't follow my path 
 If ya dissin' what I'm thinkin' then feel the wrath 
 Of the madness, ya see I'm never like anotha brotha 
 (You're dated under a pillow intended to smotha) 
 Hear the instrumental as I get inside ya mental state of mind 
 And bust a rhyme 
 Time'll tell if I'm still raisin hell 
 I drive ya like a hamma on a bed of nails 
 I'm like crack, and if ya smoke me your addicted to my speech 
 What I teach is outta reach 
 But each 
 And everyone of you'll learn from my way 
 What I do and what I say 
 Be real 
 Learn to write what you feel 
 Almost outta time 
 Almost outcha mind 
 But when I step outcha mind go back to bein you 
 The ones that cop out, drop out, minds blew 
 Don't believe what ya hear all the time 
 Esham and the Unholy, out ya mind
