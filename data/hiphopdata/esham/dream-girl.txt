Well I met this girl 
 I was daisy crazy for the ho 
 The bitch took my feelings and phased me, I know 
 I should of watched my back, but I didn't so 
 My hate for the ho begins to grow 
 I met her a month ago, it wasn't bout money though 
 As far as I could see her personality was cool 
 So I talked and talked, my intention was to bone her 
 But I found myself liking her and being all up on her 
 She teased with the pussy had my mind in the Twilight Zone 
 It was like dial-a-porn whenever we talked on the phone 
 I'm asking her "Wassup, when you gone let me hit it?" 
 She said "Right now, I'm hot and horny, hurry come and get it." 
 I reached her house in a minute, I was all up in it 
 First time I ever fucked her, damn it was splendid 
 The bitch had my mind goin' loopty loop 
 I was pussy whipped up like grandmas soup 
 Had me in a state of shock while she was ridin' my jock 
 Sweat dripped off my balls 'cause the walls was hot 
 She was sucking me and fucking me like the freak on the flick 
 Then I sucked on her titties while she rode my dick 
 She said "Please be gentle, hold me, don't let go". 
 And all I was thinking was "oh... oh" 
 Bare with me brother, I don't know what I was thinking of 
 I'm thinkin' how could makin' fuck turn outta makin' love 
 Slowly as I fucked her, she called me Harry 
 She called Charles, Earl, James, and Larry 
 I took three more strokes and then bust a nut 
 Come to find out my dream girl was just a slut 
 The freak of the week, I didn't stop to think 
 How many's made you scream girl, nasty dream girl 
 Dream girl, dream girl, fuckin' nasty, dream girl 
 Dream girl, dream girl, suckin dick, dream girl 
 Dream girl, dream girl, ho'y ass dream girl 
 You's just a bitch, dream girl 
 Dream girl, dream girl, fuckin' nasty, dream girl 
 Dream girl, dream girl, suckin dick, dream girl 
 Dream girl, dream girl, ho'y ass dream girl 
 You's just a bitch, girl, I hate you, BITCH
