Im not a atheist... 
 Oh, he let me grow up in the mother fucking ghetto 
 Thanks for nothin' mother fucker that's for real 
 One of the ten commandments is thow shall not kill 
 Tell that mother fucker with the gun in my face 
 Or should I run from this place 
 And get shot in the back 
 That's an act of insanity, "please no profanity" 
 Says the radio, but fuck you 
 I'm a do what I wanna do 
 I'm just tellin' facts 'cause blacks are killin' blacks 
 Nigga stepped on my shoe and I shot him in the back 
 Ain't no thang gotta gang you'll all get shot too 
 Once I sqeeze the trigga your crew is through 
 Think I'm bluffin then try me 
 Today you'll all die see 
 I got a bullet for you and your posse 
 I don't bullshit, no need to talk shit 
 The fuse is in your asshole and you just lit it 
 To live is evil, evils to live, you learn that 
 Put it in your holy bible and burn that 
 Words that you hearin 
 Niggas are fearin 
 Apearence so grewsome niggas are disapearin 
 Put up your fist, what is this 
 I got a mack 11 once I sqeeze the trigga you're in hell or heaven 
 I ain't waitin' around for no bodies to be found 
 Bullet to the head leave another nigga dead 
 You gotta be suicidal to fuck with a homicidal brother 
 Suffocated under a pillow intended to smother 
 Helldays death nights, midnights the witches hour 
 Damion's your maker and he loves a blood shower 
 It's time to die, so bye bye, you betta cry, nah 
 You betta run or somthing 'cause its do or die 
 If you need an ass kickin, kickin in your rib cage 
 You was a good one it read on your obituary page 
 Call me a ho them's fightin words 
 As I'm reciting words suckers are rewritin my words 
 Its simple and plain to see 
 Plain and simple to see 
 That I'm Esham and I'm great 
 You's a sucker but wait 
 This is just the style that I'm using 
 Confusing the suckers 
 'Cause they stupid mother fuckers 
 Words from the lyrical 
 To save me's a miracle 
 If anything I never thought Id turn in to a criminal 
 So here I go once again, when I rhyme I sin 
 Niggas commit suicide as soon as I begin 
 Misled, another nigga dead 
 See I love the sight of blood 'cause my favorite colors red 
 I'm smashin suckers crashin suckers dreams 
 And when it's Esham you start to scream 
 I'm hard like concrete, funky like pigs feet 
 Nigga get crazy and you'll be under six feet 
 Verse after verse it just get's worse 
 Another sucker reherse but first
