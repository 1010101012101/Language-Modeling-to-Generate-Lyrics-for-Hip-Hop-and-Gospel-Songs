Mirror mirror on the wall 
 A suicidal brotha must take a fall 
 Can I talk for a second to myself 
 Can I talk for a second to myself 
 Can I look into my eyes for a second 
 Take a second look into my eyes 
 I'm not surprised at what I see 
 I see you starin' right back at me 
 So I can take a chance, take a razor to my wrist, take a rest 
 Take me a razor from the medicine chest 
 But I hesitate to take myself out my misery 
 I gotta get my head together, oh whatever 
 Ima do, I gotta do it right now 
 'Cause I'm a suicidalist and I know how 
 Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money 
 So Elizabeth, I'm comin' to join ya honey 
 Can I get wicked, get wicked can I get 
 I'm losin my mind I can't take this shit 
 I think I'm gonna do it, gonna do it man I think 
 I bet by tomorrow dead bodies might stink 
 13 ways how to do it man I know 
 But if I gotta go I guess I gotta go 
 I'm still dreamin' about death and everyday is like dead 
 I got a screw loose and a hole in my head 
 Tick tock and you don't stop 
 Fuck the muthafuckin cops 
 Man I'm thinkin' all this crazy shit 
 I grip my dick...
