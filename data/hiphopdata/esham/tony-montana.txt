I've been yelling "reel life" for about 10 years 
 Now my eyes will shead not no more tears 
 I'ma cold hearted nigga in a cold ass world 
 Blow your ass and get wet like a jerry curl 
 I went from selling rock cocaine to doing them bigs 
 Got a reputation on for splitin them wigs 
 Ain't no palm trees no movie stars 
 Just big time ballas and fancy cars 
 Got a lifetime dream to have major cream 
 The way I'm having things it can almost seem 
 Like ain't no nigga fronting me no keys 
 Fuck a fast food job, working mickey ds 
 I'm just a young black nigga trying to stay alive 
 I work myself like michael from the jackson 5 
 I got no time for the police all in my face 
 I know many niggas out there got a murder case 
 Nigga please my whole city's under siege 
 But the question is do they believe that I'm coppin my keys 
 Ain't no nigga frontin me no keys 
 Ain't no nigga frontin me keys 
 I said ain't no nigga frontin me no keys 
 Ain't no nigga frontin me keys 
 I've been all around town try to push it down 
 I once was lost but now I'm found 
 Sellin rocks on the corner till the break of dawn 
 This shit is for the niggas that be gettin' it on 
 Big time, I know sometimes you lose your mind 
 When the streets be dry, your money be hard to find 
 Can't nobody tell me bout life and pain 
 'Cause I been through it all with the rock cocaine 
 See my momma was a junkie ever since I was born 
 I was dead at birth so I was born no more 
 I'm from detroit city where the streets be rough 
 And I think this rhyme is over 'cause I feel I said enough
