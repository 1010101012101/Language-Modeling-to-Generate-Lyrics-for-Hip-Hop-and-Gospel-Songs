"Uh... all of my life real serious... check this out... yo" 
 All of my life 
 I need a husband, boy, you need a wife 
 And so lets make it right 
 I'm through with the thugging and the hanging all night 
 Oh, baby 
 All of my life 
 I've been searchin the whole world for someone like you 
 To maybe have a daughter or a son that look like you 
 If I was true and you was true and we was true together 
 Well, then there's nothing in this world we couldn't do together 
 We went to school together plus we looked so cool together 
 They see us out there, they be like "Them two still together" 
 No matter the weather, broken wings, you patch my feathers 
 And that's why it's always heavenly forever 
 All of my life 
 I need a husband, boy, you need a wife 
 And so lets make it right 
 I'm through with the thugging and the hanging all night 
 Oh, baby 
 Let me tell you, girl, I'll never sell you, girl 
 Your heart's made out of glass, I won't drop your world 
 So precious as a pearl 
 I know I put you through some things that made you wanna cry, girl 
 But you stood by, girl 
 Girl, I need your nose bleed if I leave ya 
 I love the way you rock my boat like Aliyah 
 I can't wait to see ya, pull up in the two seater 
 Drop-top showing off your smile with a knock-knock 
 All of my life 
 I need a husband, boy, you need a wife 
 And so lets make it right 
 I'm through with the thugging and the hanging all night 
 Oh, baby 
 I'm through with runnin' the streats, my gun in my reach 
 I'm through with hanging all night. Drinking liqour ain't right 
 I just might wind up in the hospital from being irresponsible, the worst 
 I'm through with puttin' everything first 
 I'm through with everything 
 "You'll need a wife that's gonna be with you to the end ...and ever 
 ...Hustling ...through the pain ...we will struggle ...and the strain 
 ...We can struggle together ...together ...we'll be ...yeah ...oh" 
 Together... father forgive me... for all my sins... 
 I repent
