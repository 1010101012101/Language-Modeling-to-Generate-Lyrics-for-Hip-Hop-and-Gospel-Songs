Yo man, let me get one of them big motherfuckers and shit in here 
 All right man, here ya go man, give me the money man 
 Give me the money. Hey fuck that you ain't get no damn choice. 
 Get the rock and get the fuck on. 
 Sittin' down in a crack house earning my pay 
 If some base head jump crazy, I'll just blow him away 
 'Cause I'm fully wrapped, I ain't taken crap 
 I got a mini .14 with a shoulder strap 
 Base heads knocked on the door, they just knocked and knocked 
 My crack quickly disappeared one rock by rock 
 I had a couple more to go but oh no 
 Here comes the big ho bustin' down the do' 
 So I kicked out a window, jumped the roof next door 
 Took the money, left the crack but I'll get more 
 Jumped down off the roof, cops start poppin' 
 All yellin' freeze, who they thought was stoppin' 
 Cops on my tail tryin' to put me in jail 
 I slipped and I fell, got up and ran like hell 
 I was runnin' and runnin', runnin' fast as I can 
 If you would a seen me you'd a said that was the bionic man 
 Yeah I was born, this brother had got away 
 Just up the block at my homeboy's hide away 
 Bang on the door, he let me into his crib 
 Then I told him about the police and what they did 
 He gave the keys to his ride and I was back on the move 
 Jumped into his set and kicked the groove 
 You see crime is life and life is crime 
 But what would life be without a Reel Life rhyme 
 Not real life 
 Cruising around town and the bass is up 
 Running big time lights, I don't give a fuck 
 Seen the police, put the peddle to the metal 
 The pig was on my tail because the speakers rock the ghetto 
 I knew they wasn't bitches 'cause the traffics movin' fast 
 Not gonna let them get me unless they pop my ass 
 Burned big time rubber on 7 Mile 
 I was driving like a drunk cold acting wild 
 Slammed on the breaks, pressed on the gas 
 Dipped around a corner come off they ass 
 Bust a move to my crib to change my clothes 
 And since I got away from the cops I'm screamin' fuck them hoes 
 And I stepped outside, Jumped into my ride 
 Seen a couple base heads hanging out at the bar 
 Pulled over and parked, Throw 'em a sample rock 
 Had all the base heads on my jock 
 A crack fiend, god damn tried to snatch my caine 
 Whipped out my mag and blew out his brains 
 See crime is life and life is crime 
 But what would life be without a Reel Life rhyme 
 Not real life 
 All the base heads on the corner ran 
 Then a lady shouted out "That guy killed a man, he killed somebody" 
 Oh shit, God damn I got a witness 
 2 to her head and I said bitch mind your business 
 Jumped into my car, left the scene of the crime 
 2 murders uncalled for, doing no time 
 I'm a gangster on the run my solutions a gun 
 And I'll beat up your momma just for fun 
 One day I was chillin' on the East Side of town 
 Not a base head in site and none to be found 
 So my fila's kickin to the sidewalk beat 
 And my jam is kind of warm 'cause I'm packin' heat 
 You might think I'm a statistic to work this beat 
 But if I don't sell drugs then I don't eat 
 Some think that I am dumb, I don't care what they think 
 But I'm a keep getting paid until I'm locked in the click 
 Or uzi's be poppin' at my body like thunder 
 I'm dead like a doorknob, six feet under 
 That's the consequences, rich man in business 
 I'll blow up your momma in military defenses 
 Unemployed with a beard, make the school playa hate 
 The hoes on the side so you know its drug related 
 Ten G's in my pocket with the style and profile 
 Born in New York and grew up in Long Island 
 Raised in the Motown a brother throw down 
 Beefin' with the G and believe me you will go down 
 Don't start none, boy wont be none 
 Brothers want some then you got to get some 
 Crime is life and life is crime 
 But what would life be without a Reel Life rhyme 
 Not real life 
 Kicked in the face with the dope man reality 
 The brothers hard with a criminal personality 
 No one scares me, no one dares me 
 Shoot a brother in the back for crack 'cause no one cares, see 
 I'm not 18 so I can be wild 
 Cause in the courts eyes I'm still a juvenile 
 A Reel Life product, it's a rock a rock 
 The neighborhood smoking for blocks and blocks 
 And y'all fools be slippin' puffin dicks, be chokin' 
 Two weeks later your arm would be broken 
 Wake up to reality 
 I don't have a negative personality 
 But everyone have to do what they have to do to get by 
 Even sell crack
