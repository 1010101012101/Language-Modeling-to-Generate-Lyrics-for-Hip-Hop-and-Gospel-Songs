Esham: 
 1st verse 
 When I wake up in the morning I got to puff the gan 
 A pocket full of money saying IM THE MAN. 
 Got a bitch on my line I'm gonna fuck today 'cause I didn't 
 Get a chance to yesterday 
 Ima hit the buzz spot and cop a bag of true 
 No I'm bout to tell you what I fina do 
 Ima call this bitch set this date see if I can come fuck 
 Before eight 
 And if I can come fuck, bust a nut, all day I be talking 
 Bout nigga what 
 I got a homie in jail doing life for sure for living in detroit making it 
 Snow 
 Got a nigga on the west side buying my o'z, behind closed doors he 
 Sniffs it in his nose 
 Want to be like scarface sniffing the white I'm fucking this niggas bitch all last night 
 And she telling how the nigga ain't fucked her right, telling me all the news like Walter Kronkite 
 I said look here bitch I ain't your man, the shits played out like dapper dan 
 And if you looking for love you end up wrong place 
 Get your panties out your ass and get the fuck out my face. 
 2nd verse 
 First thing that I learned when I got in the game. 
 Was never talk down on a player's name 
 Like steve russel and white boy rick got the fbi all on my dick 
 I'm a young ass nigga with lots of loot, the aligotor boots and ain't afraid to shoot 
 If you bitch on my line nigga I did that cause all hoes recognize me as the mac 
 I don't care who tell I want to do the brat, pull th ebitch brains and fuck her from the back 
 I want to smoke me a blunt with cheech and chong, niggas get fucked up all night long 
 I want a check on Friday to buy some boones a fresh pair of khakis and some fruit of the looms 
 Take me out the hood but not the hood out me 
 An oz began and some hennesey 
 See I don't give a fuck you don't like my rhyme 
 A nigga like me high all the time 
 And we all know it ain't no time to waist 
 Imma just tell you GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE.
