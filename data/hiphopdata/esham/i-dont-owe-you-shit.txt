 "Yeah, this goes out to all them niggaz who bit my shit in '93, and still think I owe 'em sumthin, check it out y'all 
 Eat a dick up, eat a dick up, eat a dick up 
 Eat a dick up, eat a dick up, eat a dick up 
 Eat a dick up motherfuckers 
 (I gotta let these niggaz know) 
 (Maybe their just jealous from the dollars I'm makin') 
 I don't owe no nigga nothin' but some feel like you so 
 Left yo ass alone like Robin Carusso 
 I can freak the styles like I motherfuckin want to 
 And if you wanna kill yourself, why don't you? 
 Thirteen ways now it's all in the news 
 Life after death which one do you choose 
 Of coarse, I feel no remorse for a sucka 
 And if you wanna die you's just a dead mothafucka 
 So pucka up and kiss my ass for me 
 My shot gun said blast for me 
 Blasphemy is what I'm speakin' 
 Freakin my technique and wreckin the set 
 With a tech you get wet, upset 
 I shit, wreck the whole skit 
 Just like Bobbit cuttin' off dicks in the mix 
 Fuck them tricks like in them flix 
 I burn that ass like a Bic 
 'Cause I don't owe you shit 
 I don't owe you no nothin' like I said once befoe and 
 Niggaz like yourself best to act like you know and 
 Oh man, I fucked your ho and 
 Left some semen in demon like the O'man 
 Yo man don't, even try that shit 
 With the Unholy black devil niggaz can't get with 
 I fuck up shit just like this 'cause 
 This is for the suicidalist's 
 Don't miss if I bust a cap at your cranium 
 Russian Roulette who let me explain it um 
 Death ain't nothin' but life without the Bible 
 Oh don't let me go and get my fuckin' rifle 
 I'll go get my 12gauge and bust one 
 Slug in your head in god you trust son 
 I don't like the reverand when I state 
 Don't even pass the collection plate 
 'Cause I don't owe you shit 
 I don't owe you, but I know you 
 So you think, you can get inside my head like a shrink 
 But I'm down with the crew called N-A-T-A-S 
 And we burn up shit like David Coresh 
 Neva the less don't stress me, test me, or press me 
 Or the cops will have to come and arrest me 
 For kickin up dust, if I must I bust 
 In the nine four more niggaz I can't trust 
 So when you see me betta realize and recognize 
 That I can't be chastized 
 Open your eyes sucka, and see me just for what I am 
 A bad ass nigga who jams, god damn, BAM 
 Niggaz betta scram 
 I'm shootin up the joint like Yosemitte Sam 
 I am, not your regular nigga I will 
 Whip out the steel if you feel 'cause I don't owe you shit
