"Who's there?" 
 "Forgive me father for I have sinned." 
 "Yes my son You have a confession to make?" 
 "They want me to do it again." 
 "Those who repent shall receive salvation." 
 "I gotta go back..." 
 ...I bang on everything, boy 
 Bang! bang! bang! bang! 
 Up jump the boogie 
 And you're just a rookie 
 So I take your cookies boy 
 Bang! bang! bang! bang! 
 I'm getting money, I push the seven-sixty 
 Got green like Bill Bixby baby 
 Bang! bang! bang! bang! 
 No, you shouldna missed me 
 'Cause I'm gonna toss 'em back at ya, like hot frisbees fucka 
 Bang! bang! bang! bang! 
 It's all I know, it's all I do 
 Countin' cash in stacks, grind all night through 
 I'm pushin' packages bitch 
 I got a automatic 
 I ran down your block and popped a crack addict 
 Speakin' in tongues since I was young. I tote a uzi 
 Professional hitman, pop you and your floozie 
 Who's he? Esham, I do no interviews 
 Blood's on my tennishoes, win or lose 
 I'm finda smoke a ounce of kush 
 Fuck George Bush 
 Still on the block where it's hot murders be overlooked 
 Dreams and nightmares 
 Everythings right there 
 In the city that don't care 
 Somehow we profit off welfare - Hell yeah 
 Pistols be popping 
 Coppers is dropping 
 No time for no bitches, keep my riches 
 'Less it's coke shoppin' 
 Bang! bang! bang! bang! 
 No, you don't know me 
 I roll with my homie 
 It's Jesus, not unholy, ya heard me? 
 Bang! bang! bang! bang! 
 I send hollows threw you, I scream "Hallelujah" 
 I do ya, cause you don't know me baby 
 Bang! bang! bang! bang! 
 This is for my Crips and my Bloods 
 And all my gangstas and thugs that show slug love 
 Bang! bang! bang! bang! 
 Guns up in the club, holding a lot of drugs 
 What's really good, what? 
 Power and paper stacked up like skyscrapers 
 I'm getting my money right 
 I'm keeping my game tight 
 Oh no 
 I'm comin' up on a bubble 
 Bitches in trouble 
 Breakin boulders like Barney Rubble 
 Makin' my pockets double (whoady) 
 Slug from a forty-five, I live and die 
 Like the gangstas before me 
 Till they forty-four me 
 Or outlaw me 
 They never saw no one raw as me 
 The general in this war is me 
 Hilter 
 Young wigspliter 
 Kill any rapper out there, nuclear warfare 
 Spit napalm, Esham 
 Wicket like Taliban 
 Pushin denally from Detroit to Cali, mon 
 Wicket 
 Wicket 
 Wicket 
 It's so wicket 
 Wicket 
 The way I kick shit 
 Bang! bang! bang! bang! 
 I'm poppin' pistols 
 So duck if the bullets whistle 
 You're hopin that they don't hit you, homie 
 Bang! bang! bang! bang! 
 I'm down to buck'em all, fuck'em all 
 Till they bodys in the ground where the maggots crawl 
 Bang! bang! bang! bang! 
 This is not a game 
 Say "hello" to my little friend... Bang Bang Bang 
 Bang! bang! bang! bang! 
 Blow out your brains 
 Ain't no friends in this game 
 Fuck a five-0 and the fame 
 Prelude to all this evil, 
 Some people might say it's money whether they believe you. 
 Judgement day is still a'comin' people, never leave me. 
 It will be with me forever only time I need you's 
 When your fuckin' head is severed stackin'up my green books. 
 At night I'm playin' with black magic. Tell me, have you seen crooks 
 Busting off they automatics deep into the darkness? 
 Some might even say I'm heartless 
 Even if tha cops is around, I bang your ass regardless.
