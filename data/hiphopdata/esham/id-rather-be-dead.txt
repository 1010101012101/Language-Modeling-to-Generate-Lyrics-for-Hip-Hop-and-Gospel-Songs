In order to make that trip to the future 
 As efficiently as possible 
 There's certain things in the past 
 You'll have to leave in the past 
 I'd rather be dead 
 Than living in a world like this 
 With nothing to eat 
 No shoes on my feet 
 Can't get a job 'cause my skin color 
 Can't get a cab 'cause I'm a brother 
 My back's against the wall 
 In fear I might fall 
 My last words when I die 
 Will be fuck y'all hoes 
 Nobody knows me 
 Nobody owes me shit 
 So suck my dick 
 I'd rather be dead 'cause I'm sick 
 Of all this racism KKK shit 
 All brothers ain't bad 
 But see you treat us like animals 
 So we tend to get mad 
 This is for the suicidalists 
 I'd rather be dead 
 Grab a nine and I might just 
 Cross my heart and hope to die 
 Pull the trigger 
 And kiss the whole world good bye 
 This is for my dead homies 
 Dead bodies found layin' in my pocket 
 But ya don't know me 
 You still creamin' on my old shit 
 But I ain't said nothing new 
 It's just that you don't know shit 
 I'm still knockin' 'em out 
 Knockin' 'em dead 
 Did what I said 
 'Cause I'd rather be dead 
 I'd rather be dead 
 I'd rather be dead no jokin' 
 No use prayin' 
 With the preacher for money 
 It ain't workin' 
 No use gettin' me a nine to five 
 'Cause either way you look at it 
 I'm breakin' my back to be alive 
 It goes something like that 
 Then something like this 
 Next thing you know I get pissed 
 My life is up an down 
 How you think that sound 
 I'd rather be dead 
 I can't fuck around 
 Time is wastin' 
 Lost the rat racin' 
 I just found out 
 My dad's free basin' 
 Problems fall on my head like a ton of bricks 
 And all I wanna do is get my gun quick 
 Bad news 
 Bad signs 
 And every time I wanna talk 
 Somebody tell me it's a bad time 
 Another victim of circumstance 
 Mislead 
 That's why I'd rather be dead 
 For those of you who had trauma in the past 
 (I'd rather be dead) 
 Experienced set backs 
 Love didn't work out for ya 
 I'd rather be dead 'cause I'm pissed off 
 And I'm mad at the world 
 I ain't got to girl or no money 
 Everything's sad but funny 
 Everybody seems to think I'm a dummy 
 But I'm gonna show 'em all 
 I won't miss none of y'all 
 Try to figure out why I did it 
 You think you know it 
 I'm gonna hold my breath 
 And wish my death 
 And when I open my eyes 
 I wish that there's no more life left in my body 
 So I can party with the devil 
 'Cause I'm goin' to hell 
 Might as well 
 Soul and body 
 Embedded in a wooden box 
 When they put me in the ground 
 People just couldn't stop cryin' 
 'Cause they heard my soul is dyin' 
 I'm going to hell 
 So you can stop tryin' to pray for me 
 You Should've talked to me 
 Now I'm gonna haunt your ass 
 Every night you sleep 
 You better heed the word 
 That the dead man said 
 'Cause one day 
 You'll rather be dead 
 There's present tense 
 There are problems 
 There are solutions 
 When we dwell too much on the problems 
 Your not spending enough time 
 Quality time 
 On the solutions 
 The solutions are the only thing that will delete the problems
