Born beat up and always hungry 
 Never thought I'd turn into a criminal if anything 
 Runnin' from the cops like Al Capone 
 Goin' Rambo on them mother fuckers like Sly Stallone 
 Got a gat in my pants like its part of my belt 
 Suckers scared like butter so they start to melt 
 I stand silent like concrete in Detroits streets 
 What a rich man throws away is what a poor man eats 
 When I was 5 my mind start to blow 
 Told my teacher I want to be like Hitler when I grow up 
 When I was 7 disregarded the laws of heaven 
 I went to church on Sunday and I cussed out the reverand 
 When I was 10 I started committing sin 
 Witchcraft and voodoo with needles and pins 
 When I became an adolescent I never learned my lesson 
 Puttin' holes in mother fuckers with a fuckin' smith and wesson 
 A homicidal vital recital Esham my title 
 I know my shit is deaf and I know you want a bite oh 
 But no don't do it you'll be just a carbon copy 
 Esham is original and everyone else is sloppy 
 Still I kill I'm sweet like Sugar Hill 
 Not your average everyday elemantry run of the mill 
 Mother fucker get it strait I don't battle that's for suckers 
 You wish you was down with Reel Life Product ain't that right brothers 
 I don't bullshit no need to bullshit 
 You pull some shit and you'll be pullin bullets 'n' shit 
 Brother think I'm bluffin pull me bluff and get fucked up and 
 Its time for me to shut up 'cause I really said enough
