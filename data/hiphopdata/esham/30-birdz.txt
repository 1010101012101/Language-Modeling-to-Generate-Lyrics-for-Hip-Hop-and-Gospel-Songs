30 birdz, 30 birdz all I want is 30 birdz 
 I'm never catchin cases, stead I'm clockin 3rd 
 I got 36 ounces, thousand grams of scams 
 Anything over 500 is life so damn 
 I'm goin' for broke, I ain't no joke when I flip flop 
 Niggaz want static, automatically the clip pops 
 Born into this life with no escape from playa hates 
 Down to stack papes, goin' pyscho like Norman Bates 
 Amphetmenes, the dope fiends, I stacks greens 
 Damn niggaz tryin' to stick for my cream 
 My lifes turned upside down, don't fuck around 
 Bustin' bullets for stacks, so dead bodies is found 
 On a mission for money, shit seems funny to me, 
 Nigga try to take my birdz and set 'em free, 
 Now how can this be I heard he caught a federal case, 
 Caught with more dope in his crib than scarface, 
 Talkin' to federalies from Detroit to Cali, 
 Nigga tryin' to catch me slippin like silly Sally, 
 I dumped his body in the alley, and shot 'em a close range 
 Nigga wasn't loyal to the game so I poped his ass 
 30 birdz,30 birdz got no loyalty, 30 birdz flew away from me, them dirty birdz 
 I got away as clean as a whistle, another 187 on my pistol 
 Visions of my burial, got make another move 20 birdz to go 
 Life ain't nothin' but money, so I make snow 
 Sometime it get slow, I get paranoid 
 Jail and hell is 2 thingz that I can't avoied 
 Mama always saw certain shit I couldn't see 
 Its hard for me to see gone of v.s.o.p. 
 A deal is deal, plus I'm tryin' to make a meal 
 Feelin' bad a nigga had to kill, just to stay real 
 It started out samll time, big time, and no time 
 Crime is my life and my life is crime 
 I'm sick of seeing dope fiends and burned down blocks 
 Hearin screams and 17 shots from hot glocks 
 Back in the days I used to roll down to crack spots 
 Now I watch niggaz cry right before they die 
 Niggaz be snitchin, you cookin keys in your kitchen 
 Buried a half a mill, in my backyard steel 
 Trought all the excitment, federal indietment 
 Now I'm on the run, with 10 birdz and a gun 
 And even if I get caught they only know my name 
 I ain't tellin' no shit, 'cause I be loyal to this game 
 I went to ten fuckin' states, dropped of ten birdz 
 1996, January, the 3rd, I was in a Detroit motel with a trick 
 Thinkin' bout goin' out like Maserati Rick our the Chambers family, Y.B.I 
 200 key stole like redbird and I, from all the shit I did growin' up as a kid 
 Now they got my ass facing a lifetime bid, I'm on the run from the law 
 Runnin' out of time, goin' out my mind, from my life of crime 
 Seems I must a been slippin, didn't catch the setup 
 Bullets flying through the window and my bitch got wet up 
 Seems I had to get my pay like Demetrius Holloway 
 Down at the broadway from the AK spray 
 As my heart stop beating all I was hoping was not to die with my eyes open
