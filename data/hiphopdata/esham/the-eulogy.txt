Eulogy by Richard Pryor 
 We are gathered here today, On this sorrowful occasion, To say goodbye to the 
 Dearly departed, In other words the nigga dead. Whether or not you can survive 
 Death, that's the ultimate test for your ass ain't it. So far don't nobody we 
 Know has passed the ultimate test. Least of all this nigga layin here. 'Cause this 
 Boy wasn't shit, I'm gonna tell you that right off. I say him kickin his moma's 
 Ass over ther on 47th street. And if you think we gonna ban you with those 
 Diamonds and shit on you got another thing comin'. I'd like to introduce the 
 Boys woman, Oh bitch I dunno what she was. she's layin over ther in the booth. 
 Say girl. What you doin'? Well don't sell your pussy in here. If you do I wanna 
 Cut. shit. Yo fault the nigga dead.
