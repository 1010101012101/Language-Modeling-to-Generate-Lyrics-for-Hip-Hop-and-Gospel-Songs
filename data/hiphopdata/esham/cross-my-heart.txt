Son of a bitch, Jason wants to slit his wrists 
 But I'll tell you like this, should'nt take the risk 
 Knowin' the consequences well 
 The suicidal suckers end up in hell 
 Some rather be dead then living in sin 
 'Cause the planet is fucked up and misled 
 By fools like you 
 Runnin' round tellin' mother fuckers what they can and can't do 
 Butterflys in my stomach 
 Make me wanna vomit 'cause I know doomsday is coming 
 Jasons facin life or death, it's do or die 
 And as he take a deep breath he wonders who will cry 
 The only one who really cares is you and I 
 But your the only one who really knew why 
 Lifes a bitch from beginning to end and then you die 
 Living the life of sin and why 
 I can see it in your eyes I'm not surprised 
 As you cross your heart and hope to die 
 Living your life on the edge of panic 
 But still you manic 
 'Cause you was born a schizophrenic 
 Never knew life was a bitch, but it is so hard 
 I'm living low in the graveyard 
 Take a trip to another side another place 
 Lying in a casket wit a dead man's face 
 Who gives a fuck about you, nobody but you 
 But I didn't have to tell you take 'cause that's something you already knew 
 Just like a razor to the wrist I'm a cut you quick 
 Last dying words is I'm a son of a bitch 
 Son of a gun and I've just begun to bleed 
 As I scream Jesus Christ and fall to my knees 
 And as everyone cries they wonder why 
 I cross my heart and hope to die 
 My rhyme is a nine to the forehead 
 And once you push play you'll pull the trigga and now your dead 
 A suicidal homicidal homicidal suicidal recital 
 Is what I recite when I'm on the mic 
 At midnight I'll smother you like crib death 
 And find my record spinning 
 You'll never no I was grinnin when I did that 
 This is the U-N-H-O-L-Y 
 Deadly, like pesticide 
 So just step aside 
 Once I knew a little girl was playin' my tape on Sunday 
 They found her in some headphones dead on Monday 
 Hanging from a chandelier the only thing to fear is fear 
 When you get them butterflies you know the Unholy is near 
 Some disappear and never be found 
 Some are smothered by the rhythm and then drown 
 And when I blow your mind your wont know why 
 You'll soon cross your heart and hope to die
