My heads been hurtin' since 83' 
 Since birth my mommas been afraid of me 
 I was raised by the streets 
 I was made to be a young nigga makein cash so easily 
 I rolled into town full of playas and snitches 
 Every nigga I know be down for riches 
 OZ's, 8ths, kilos, and pounds 
 Nigga just yo ass right out of bounds 
 7 m-i-l-e's where I ride 'cause I roll through yo town like suicide 
 If you see me on the streets gotta bloody pistol 
 Triple beam OZ's get cut for crystal 
 Might come to your town and I'll kill your crew 
 Put a crack house right next door to you 
 If I fucked your bitch man it's all in the game 
 I done nutted in her mouth and don't know her name 
 Might come to your hood with my bad intentions 
 To fuck all the bitches with the hair extensions 
 If you see a nigga lookin' to side of my ride 
 Just look for the joint in my mouth and you can say I'm fried 
 You can say I'm fried 
 You can say I'm fried 
 I got a track violation warrant for my rep 
 To dope case bleedin to no contempt 
 Had to beat a nigga ass at the liquor sto' 
 'Cause he said he wouldn't sell me alcohol no mo' 
 Fuck that I gotta get my buzz and die 
 Get high still DWI 
 What the fuck y'all know about a millionaire gettin' money slappin hoes screamin I don't care 
 I'm the neighborhood crook screamin fuck the hook 
 I'm the nigga that snatched yo mom's pocket book 
 Wicked shit, shit don't stop forever 
 Playa hatas hate me nigga whatever 
 I be fuckin' these hoes since 94' 
 Screamin fuck these tricks in 96' 
 Real life I'll life fuckin' dikes hangin' with Dice screamin what'd it be like 
 Nigga ridin', high sidin, suicidein, murder-i-ing 
 Nigga You can say I'm fried 
 You can say I'm fried 
 You can say I'm fried 
 I like money and everythin' that comes with that 
 I like pussy and big hoe asses fat 
 I like hoes suck dick at a drop of a dime 
 Put a gun in yo mouth and let it blow yo mind 
 Bitch boy my names Esham for real 
 Niggas still I kill for my dollar 
 So real I'm out for the fortune and game 
 Street politics, tricks, to cocaine 
 Sittin' in a crack house earnin' my snaps 
 Way before I was bustin' 'em raps 
 It's the c-o-c-a-i-n-e now lets niggas be dope on the m-i-c 
 So fuck what you heard about me before I'm the same ol' nigga 
 Esham's dough hoe
