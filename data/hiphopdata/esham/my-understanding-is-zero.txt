My understanding is zero 
 For the simple fact I'm not a hero 
 Born broke, beat up and always acting evil 
 I'm playin' for keeps 
 I gots to carry my shank 
 And keep my hands on my thang 
 While I'm checkin' my bank 
 I gots nothin' to lose 
 But I'd rather be six feet deep 
 I sing the blues 
 'Cause I'm deep and I don't sleep 
 My understanding's zero watchin channel fuzz 
 I don't like the fuzz 
 I'm like was not was 
 And if I was not 
 Then I was not or will be 
 You better murder me man 
 I'm tellin' y'all to kill me 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y, that's what they call me 
 My last words is like 
 "Fuck all y'all, G" 
 And when I die I'm takin' muthafuckaz out with me 
 And when I die the meat-wagon's gonna come and get me 
 My understanding's zero 'cause I'm just a zero 
 I hear no, I say no, I see no, no evil Yo! 
 Is I crazy, Is I am, Is I am? 
 My butcherknife's bloody 
 So fuck a flim flam 
 And bout your God, bout your God 
 Your God is money man 
 In God we trust 
 The ill rhyme I bust, oh! 
 I fall into a state, I'm in depression 
 Playin' me a game of true confessions 
 I want y'all to know, I want y'all to know 
 If you grow up in the ghetto 
 Your understanding's zero, zero, zero
