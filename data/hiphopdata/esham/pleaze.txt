Baby, I been holding somthing inside me for a very long time and uh, I gotta tell you what it is, so just listen baby, ok? 
 Too much time has past for me to go without ass 
 You tell me to slow down, you think I'm movin to fast 
 So I do what you wish and slow down just a little bit 
 Hugs and kisses ain't gettin' it no more 
 I need some pussy, shit 
 I'm tired of this waiting and dating ain't gettin' me no where 
 It's a hotel around the corner sugar why don't we go there 
 And plus I have to mention 
 I have to releave my sexual tension 
 I don't make love, I fuck so baby pay attention 
 I did it like tradition and waited, but you still say no? 
 Fuck that shit, I'm gettin' mad I need some pussy ho 
 Don't even bore me with that foreplay 'cause my dick is ready 
 Straight to the pussy, dick is hard and I'll rock it steady 
 You want me to beg, well then I'm down on my knees 
 I'm addicted to bust a nut 
 So why don't you make me bust a nut pleaze 
 (Esham tryin' to get some) 
 Baby what's up, 'cause I'm tired of this convo 
 You gonna give it up or what a simple yes or no 
 Yes will get you fucked, but no will get you fucked up 
 You used that period shit on me too many times and lucked up 
 Your peroid was the other day, I know you ain't on it 
 You be the steak and I'll be the bone 
 And I know your on birth control 
 So condoms are not involved 
 Just let me stick my jimmy inside you my problems solved 
 Your pussy's wet and your still tellin' me not yet 
 My dick don't get no harder than this bitch, fuck that 
 You tellin' me no like it's going outta style ho 
 So when I fuck you I'm a hit it for a while ho 
 You want me to beg, well then I'm down on my knees 
 I'm addicted to bust a nut 
 So why don't you make me bust a nut pleaze 
 (Esham tryin' to get some) 
 You talkin' 'bout you wanna go home 
 How you gonna go home when my dick still on bone 
 (My mama said I gotta be home) 
 Fuck that, I ain't for that 
 And when you get home, tell that ho that 
 Girl you think I'm jokin, fuck that I need some ass ho 
 Rapes on my mind so don't make me have to ask ho 
 The clock is tickin and I'm kickin my game to ya 
 But instead I'd rather be stickin my dick to ya 
 Baby what's up, this the last time I'm a say 
 We don't fuck, you don't go home today 
 And P.S. bitch, I'm tired of gettin' on my knees 
 And I'm oh so tired of sayin' the mother fuckin' word 'pleaze' 
 (Esham tryin' to get some)
