Tell me your deepest fear 
 Tell me your deepest fear 
 Losin' my inhibitions 
 Callin' my intuitions 
 Somethin's goin' on if I'm feelin' 
 I'm superstitious, I'm vicious 
 I'm tryin' decide the paradox 
 When my thoughts get twisted 
 Like some dreadlocks 
 I never ever wondered 'bout the voodoo 
 I sing the voodoo, 
 And now my deepest fears is comin' true 
 I never loved you but I hate you, how, 
 How could I love you, how, 
 Because I hate you now 
 So wonder, I take you under 
 With the wickedness 
 I'll make a preacher slit his fuckin' wrist 
 No comin' near me when I'm thinkin' is, 
 'Cause when I'm thinkin' is, 
 I'm thinkin' suicidalist, uh 
 So back up off me, bust a brain cell 
 I bust a brain cell 
 I fall asleep and dream about hell 
 Some wonder why I'm even callin' y'all 
 The sky is fallin' y'all 
 But after all it's my deepest fear 
 Morty, no where to run to, 
 No where to hide 
 Morty, how you gonna hide 
 From the fears inside? 
 Chemical dependancies, 
 Suicidal tendencies 
 Brain on meltdown, street labotomy 
 Claustrophobia, locked in a pine box 
 Now I lay me down to sleep,6 feet deep 
 Closed casket, just another basket case 
 Not a maniquin, or the madman, 
 So you panicin' 
 Run from me, everybody scared so 
 You callin' out 
 Buck shot shot gun blast 
 Now ya fallin' out 
 Everybody hide from the deepest fears inside 
 Watch me and my man Morty 
 Take you on a murder ride 
 Suicide, symptoms of insanity 
 I'm breakin' out probably wanna crack-a 
 But I'm never ever crackin' out 
 Call me Dr. Frankenstein 
 Dead body stinkin', I'm gonna get wit cha', 
 When I hit cha', I'm a slit cha' 
 Nobody can hold me I'm as safe as clear 
 Buried alive in the pine box 
 Is my deepest fear... 
 Morty's coming... 
 It's ever so clear, my deepest fear 
 Is to hear the screams 
 The sounds of a madman 
 Embottled in Morty's theme 
 My dream and nightmares come true, simply voodoo 
 Halucinate and visions of killin' you 
 The thought of even thinkin' that 
 I think I need a drink 
 In fact I think I need some therapy 
 'Cause ain't nobody helpin' me' 
 Since I got no excuses for 
 Mental abuses I'm losin' faith 
 My only fear is to love instead of hate you 
 Born and bred, born dead 
 My mind bled every time the holy Bible was read 
 Instead I lost consciousness and wound up with wicked ways 
 Thinkin' 'bout voodoo dolls 
 Runnin' wild my last days 
 Spent with Morty, my shorty 
 No ventriliquist 
 Esham, the unholy 
 Straight suicidalist
