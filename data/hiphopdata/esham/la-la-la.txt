We got wicked ways, for your sunny days, we got murder for your birthday parties 
 Yeah, we see diamonds fall, Got our dicks topped off, but we still can't wait to be dead bodies 
 So many snakes spittin' venom, speakin' my name in vein 
 Knowin' my claim to fame is this game I slang 
 Through the storm and rain, shotgun thunderin' pain 
 Tell me, am I to blame if I blow out your brains? 
 Give me one good reason I should not be squeezin' 
 On every bitch ass nigga like you 'cause it's bitch ass nigga like you siezin' 
 I'm a real sick fella, big fella 
 You got a lotta lip for a nigga that ain't shit fella 
 Always been about my hustle, been about my money 
 It ain't all about rhyme and I ain't never act funny 
 But these bitch ass niggas in this game unreal 
 Quick to flip the fuckin' script for the mass appeal 
 But once they blood gets spilled, let's see how many feel 
 That they gotta die for anotha shady record deal 
 Who am I? The pretty boy, the city boy 
 The sniff a coke up off ya titty boy, the gritty boy 
 The never actin' hostity boy 
 The hold it down with me boy 
 I seek and destroy 
 I get paid to employ you so I must employ 
 MCs enjoy my style but yet they still annoy me 
 La, La, La, La, La, La 
 La, La, La, La, La, La, La 
 La, La, La, La, La, La, La, Laaaa 
 La, La, La, La, La, La 
 La, La, La, La, La, La, La 
 La, La, La, La, La, La, La, Laaaa 
 Fuck what you do, you so fake 
 Everything you do, everything you make 
 Still suicidal, how much can I take? 
 Pressure can bust a pipe but I will not break 
 Forget the type of shit where you can't relate 
 The world on my shoulda hold down the weight 
 Money hungry niggas out her will snatch ya plate 
 The greedy never care about if you ain't ate 
 Try gettin' out the game before it's too late 
 Or before The Wraith come and seal ya fate 
 Still knock knock knockin' on heaven's gates 
 And you can't get in for sellin' cakes 
 For, for sellin' cakes 
 Or, or sniffin' flakes 
 For, for sellin' cakes 
 Or, or sniffin' flakes 
 For, for sellin' cakes 
 Or, or sniffin' flakes 
 For, for, for, for, for, for sellin' cakes
