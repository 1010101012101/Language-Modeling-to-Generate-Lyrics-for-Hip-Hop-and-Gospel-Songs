Too much perpin' it ain't workin 
 Say ya gettin' pussy but ya dick ya jerkin 
 Niggaz be frontin, tellin' lies to these ho's 
 That's how it goes, well I suppose 
 They like it, they want it, shake it and flaunt it 
 Tease 'em and skeeze em, some never please em 
 Niggaz they lyin', perpin' and tryin' 
 To be the coolest, I think it's foolish 
 I think it's foolish some nigga just died 
 Perped to ho's and ya don't know why 
 For goodness sake, for your sake, for anybody's sake 
 Nigga, you fake. 
 Perpetration, same situation 
 Perpetration, same situation 
 Perpetration, same situation 
 Perpetration, same situation 
 Friends... always make ends 
 Back in the day I had Adidas top tens 
 Pony down, can't fuck around 
 Niggaz get shot down in Motown 
 Boy we was down since day one G 
 Bought yourself a key, now you don't know me 
 Gotta little money now your attitudes funny 
 Pockets like sunshine always sunny 
 Treat me funny, man go figga 
 You can take the nigga out the ghetto 
 But not the ghetto out the nigga 
 Niggaz get funny, when they get money 
 Perpin' on yo homie 
 Now you wanna be fake, be fake 
 But when your broke ya break, brotha 
 I ain't got no love fo' ya 
 'Cause you be perpin' man 
 Perpetration, same situation 
 Perpetration, same situation 
 Perpetration, same situation 
 Perpetration, same situation 
 Lemme tell ya 'bout a bitch 
 A bitch ain't nothin', 24/7 all they good for is fuckin' 
 And once they get inside your head 
 Man you'd rather be dead, 'cause it'll drive you nuts 
 And I ain't frontin, I ain't frontin on that ho shit 
 You sayin' "Oh shit" just because I know shit 
 Pussy's like crack and it'll have a nigga hooked 
 Have a nigga slippin, shit get's over looked 
 A bitch a tell you "I love you" in a minute 
 And then the next day anotha niggaz up in it 
 Fuckin' your woman, nuttin on her belly 
 Tellin' you about the peanut butter and the jelly 
 Damn, how a nigga know about that? 
 Anotha dog done went and chased that cat 
 And now you feelin' dumb, and full of frustration 
 'Cause your bitch was perpin' 
 Perpetration, same situation 
 Perpetration, same situation 
 Perpetration, same situation
