ICP and Esham wicked rappers delight 2015 
 Feinds of the wicked shit its time to get high 
 Bump your fuckin' shit up for somthin wicked shit by 
 Detroits legendary demon lopatara 
 Staring you right back through your eyes in the mirror 
 Blowing out your brains spontaneous combustion 
 Lyrics like a barrel in each ear and I'm bustin' 
 Fire breathin wicked shit meltin microphones 
 Blowing speakers into flames, settin fires to your home 
 How many times you gonna say I need help 
 Who gives a fuck if I murder myself 
 I'm thinkin' suicidal thoughts I shot a gay preacher 
 I didn't do my homework so I shot my teacher 
 I dropped out the next day fuck a g.e.d 
 Then I went and clowned the industry with ICP 
 Through up the 313, to let them know it was me 
 Esham is dope ho I'm the king of the D 
 I stole a fuckin' firetruck and drove through a wendys 
 All that happen to me was a bullet in the kidneys 
 I almost died then but look at me I ride again 
 What's really happenin', reality is pretend 
 You can blow my fuckin' head off ill just grow another 
 My brain and my self, we don't even know each other 
 Somones in the darkness crawling out of my closet door 
 That's what the nines in the mattress for 
 Warlocks and witches come and learn from the master 
 The walls of my home feature bodys in the plaster 
 The dead but sticking out like hon solo when he froze 
 With my favorite weapons hanging off there fingers and toes 
 Wicked pimpin', scary bitches, livin' or dead 
 Or with vampire fangs and they givin' me head 
 Like cemetery girls back dance boogie woogie baddy 
 Her nedens big and blew out like a plate of spaghetti 
 I'm out cold all my teeth gold 
 Plus I don't brush them 
 Quarterback sneakin plus don't care (?) you rush em 
 Bust 'em down bust 'em up steady fuckin' 'em up 
 But wait why do I have all this blood on my hands 
 Blood on my clothes blood on my shoes 
 I'm on the 10 o clock news for steady 
 Murdering crews and there point of views 
 I'm like purple chronic mixed with acid, demonic 
 In a stomach full of jagermeister ready to vomit 
 Mirror mirror on the wall tell us who the wicked are 
 Shaggy E and Jay we in the game and gettin' ours 
 Hittin stars in there mouth and bumpin off with rented necklaces 
 Wicked reckless nobody expected 
 Bumpin this wicked shit'll boil your brain dead 
 I can fry a mutha fuckin' egg on your head 
 Break in and tie your fuckin' feet up to your neck 
 Shoot you in the back once and kick you down the steps 
 I blow a crater in the side of your head 
 Do the same to your misses while y'all sleepin' in bed 
 Double murder robbery just another job to me 
 Rollin' in a stolen buick hookers slobbin me 
 Known though the farms lands as a duke of the wicked 
 Always shootin the biggots and bootin the chickens 
 Askin me the wrong question also triggers my disease 
 They will find your body in compton in hallis (?) queens 
 The phone rung and on the other end it was the president 
 I can't talk right now I'm on the toilet takin' a shit 
 Hung up the phone I think my cover is blown I'm deep cover 
 Your wife ordered a pizza from me she got the meat lovers 
 I'm johnny bravo the other black reo (?) get at me ho 
 I make these hos happy tho 'cause I'm there pappy oh 
 Its to soon for you to be on my team 
 But give are kelly a call I think like 'em 13 
 I once met a hooker and she did it for free 
 On the west verner bus number 73 
 All the way in the back she was humping on me 
 Until I strangled the bitch and stuffed her under my seat 
 I got off on my stop without as much as a drop of blood 
 But then I realized I forgot to wear gloves 
 Now I'm chasing the bus my finger prints are on her neck 
 Stop! and gimme my dead bitch back! 
 Fuckin' dead bitches on a Ouija board all night 
 Bustin' off shots in the club we all fight 
 Hanging mother fuckers my there neck off of street lights 
 With there legs cut off tryin' to read me rights (shiiit) 
 I whip my CD at you, stick it in yo face 
 Half way stickin out but look it still plays 
 I stomp when I rap and I shake the whole block 
 Stick my dick in your ear so you can hear what I got 
 I was one of those monsters in the video thriller 
 Known to the world as the pop star killer 
 And on another part from the ground I arose 
 I'm the crusty ass booger hanging out of your nose 
 I'm the stink on your toes I'm the weed to your rose 
 Not one of your friends but one of your foes 
 And spittin' the wicked shit is the life I chose 
 Do a spin grab my nuts then be boy pose 
 Chain you up for some tic tacs bloody mess 
 We draw the board on your chest and take turns shootin the rest 
 I win every time, beep the beat is good with every rhyme 
 And off with your head if in the way (?) your gettin' mine 
 This is esham and the wicked clowns for the vote 
 We come flying out the dark with a triple moonsault 
 I through a snowball so hard it replaced your eye 
 It melted and left a fuckin' hole and it was dry
