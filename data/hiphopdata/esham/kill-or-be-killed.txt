In 1989 I was pushin dimes out the crack houses 
 Tryin' to get ?my mail on? 
 I got my self on? 
 I murdered 2 baseheads 'cause they tried to tell on 
 The nigga with the 3-5-7 chrome, my mind was gone 
 When I did dirt, I was alone 
 Got on 
 Got strong 
 I put my homie down, and we was down 
 In the summer time we made it snow all over town 
 200 Gs made money still coming in 
 Gotta connect with the ill columbian 
 No matter who you trust you simply cannot win 
 It's always fun in the beginning but it's pain in the end 
 My homie got shot, murdered on 7-mile 
 In broad daylight 
 At night 
 I squeeze the AK tight 
 And fear I might be next in line 
 For the body choke outline 
 It's going down... 
 Kill or be killed nigga 
 U ain't reel nigga 
 Feel my steel nigga 
 It seems niggaz wanna test me 
 Police out to arrest me 
 'Cause the streets ?wanna? child molest me 
 I emptied out the full clip 
 Now police got they hands full of bullshit 
 Its drug related 
 So they hate it 
 I figure it was that nigga who I last saw the ???? 
 Murdered my homie in his cherokee 
 I saw that nigga at the mcdonalds drive through, so I pulled up to his ??? 
 And unloaded my dumper 
 He had, his bitch and his baby in the car 
 But I didn't give a fuck, automatically unloaded, all of they asses got struck 
 187 on my pistol bullets to throw away 
 Cop cars pull into the mcdonalds as I try to get away 
 They say we got the car surrounded, come out with your hands up 
 At this point I didn't give a fuck 
 It's going down... 
 Murder weapon in my hands, dead bodies I blast 
 Havin' the whole city's souls just to dig up the past 
 They wanna negotiate my surrender, no way I ain't goin' out like that 
 I looked at him, and cocked the gat 
 Flashbacks of bloody bodies and cemeteries 
 So I did what was nessacary 
 And what was nessacary was... 
 (Cops yelling out stuff)
