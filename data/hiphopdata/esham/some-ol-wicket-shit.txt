Some ol' wicked shit 
 Some ol' wicked shit 
 Some ol' wicked shit 
 Some ol' wicked shit 
 Midnight's the witches hour and you're outside 
 Somebody played the Reel Life Product tape and committed suicide 
 Tried to save a soul, it can't be done 
 Unholy to the Son of Satan, I ain't the one 
 Congratulations brothers and sisters who pray for me 
 Some slaved for me and still prayed for me 
 Some say my rhyme is satanic, it'll make you vomit and I admit 
 I'm the shit when it comes down to it, just suing it do it 
 Unholy poet, your mind, I blow it 
 If ya ever heard me rhyme for the first time 
 Hear, it's like a hurricane, stunning like Novocain 
 Simple and plain, Reel Life Product is insane 
 You're fucking with the wrong one 
 Listen to the song's done 
 Fuck around and be on the wrong end of a gun, son 
 You're listening to insanity 
 But that's just a man in me 
 I said I'm Esham and you said how can it be 
 I'm a psychopathic, automatic 
 Reel Life Product pro static, fuck it 
 Some ol' wicked shit 
 Some ol' wicked shit 
 Some ol' wicked shit 
 Some ol' wicked shit 
 Some ol' wicked shit 
 Some ol' wicked shit 
 Some ol' wicked shit 
 Some ol' wicked shit 
 I'm the U-N-H-O-L-Y better known as Esham 
 Champs or chumps, step up and get some, punk 
 Playing around with me is like playing with a rattlesnake 
 I shake and bake and break the fake 
 Reel Life Product's grim 
 A schizophrenic mother fucker features looking dim 
 R-E-A-L L-I-F-E a P-R-O-D to the U-C-T 
 Reel Life Product's what I spit 
 I very seldom yell 
 The record sella's sucking dope sell 
 I have the mind of the devil, the body of Lucifer 
 Give me a mic and watch me get loose for you 
 It's a mother fucker that suicide the way 
 Another homicide, I live another day I lied 
 I said I was the Unholy 'cause a preacher told me 
 The U-N-H-O-L-Y is a brotha with soul see 
 And sink down in the goddamn screechas 
 I'm not Satanic so fuck y'all bitches
