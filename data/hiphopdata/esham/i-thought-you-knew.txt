(Woman singing) 
 (Esham) 
 I thought you knew, but it seems you don't 
 So now I gotta put you in yo place because most niggaz won't 
 Give you all a piece of my mind 
 The truth'll set you free and the truth is hard to find 
 Had a little hoe, she loved to wine and dine 
 Her favorite number's 69, so is mine 
 In those times a nigga felt good 
 In the sunshine, I misunderstood 
 Many hoes, many hoes 
 I ran through plenty hoes, plenty hoes 
 Call me a pimp or a mack dad 
 Or call me a Mr.Propalac dad 
 It's a toss up if my homies fell through 
 See I shouldn't have to tell you 
 I thought you knew 
 (Singing) 
 I thought you knew about the Unholy Black Devil 
 Dick in my hand 
 To let you know where I stand (stand) 
 I with my man with the 40 in his hand (hand) 
 I can't trust the cops 'cause they the Ku Klux Klan (Klan) 
 Motown, all the real niggaz know 
 The radio try to play me out like a hoe 
 'Cause I won't criss cross over to the pop 
 Just 'cause I gotta little problem with the cops 
 Props come and the radio go 
 But I ain't nobody's hoe 
 I thought you knew 
 (Singing) 
 I thought you knew about a nigga like me 
 I'm just into clockin cash 
 But some niggaz clockin me 
 And still don't know the time 
 All on my line 
 Just 'cause I'm fuckin' ya woman's mind 
 I gotta get my roll on 
 I gotta get my stroll on 
 I gotta get 'em on 
 And once it's on, I'm feelin' all right 
 I think I'ma fuck yo woman tonight 
 'Cause I don't care 
 I don't give a fuck 
 About bushy kissin' ya baby and how she sucked on my nuts 
 I fucked her in the butt like yesterday 
 I ain't got nuttin else to say 
 I thought you knew 
 (Singing)
