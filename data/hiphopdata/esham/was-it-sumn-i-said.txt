Was it sum'n I said 
 That made me your idol 
 See I'd rather be dead 
 That's why I'm suicidal 
 And my head keeps spinnin like every day 
 But it's best to burn out then to fade away 
 See I am what I am and that's all that I am 
 But when I'm not high, a poor excuse for a man 
 I ain't drinkin' no forty, thinkin' time with the nine 
 Can't you understand, I'm the tigger man 
 The drama's in life is so highly diluted 
 In time you will find wicket rhymes executed 
 From dawn to dusk you might hear me bust 
 Deep peep the wicket shit and your skull a crush 
 Exodus, Alpha, Omega come again 
 All the hate you create is comin' from with in 
 Amen anotha sin once my mind is bled 
 When it's done and said I'm done as dead 
 Flatline...
