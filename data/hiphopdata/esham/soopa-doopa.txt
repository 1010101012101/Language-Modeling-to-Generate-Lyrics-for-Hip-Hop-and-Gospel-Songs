I'm used to driving Benzes and Porches and Corvettes 
 You might see me in LA on Sunset 
 Or in Nevada, betting, three-digit degrees, not sweatin 
 Wearing leather, super fly, light as a feather, 
 Esham, Louie Vaton 
 Guns like megatron 
 Wont stop my reign on the world till armeggedon come 
 Underground phenemenon 
 I wrote the Necronomicon 
 You's an autobot, I'm a decepticon 
 Never steppin without my weapon son, the Smith 'n' Wesson 
 Teach you a lesson son 
 In the blackout I was gone and knowin' where the pressures on 
 Don't sleep till dawn 
 All those who doze, wake up with your shit gone 
 Emergency, emergency, Dr. Evil, brain surgery 
 Go to court in the trial took the stand, committed purgery 
 Kavorkian, King the scorpian 
 Killed 'em all, but some still choose to plot on my downfall 
 I'm a mo-onster, I'm a co-onquer 
 Suicidalist, murder be my sponsor 
 How you gonna reason with a psycho 
 I might go blaow when the gat sparks glow like tyco 
 Kill all heroes (kill all heroes) 
 Easily (easily) 
 Who is Super Villains? (who is super villains?) 
 I'm used to having money and product and narcotics 
 Bitches on my dick still begging me for dollars 
 Hollar hollar if you heard me from Detroit to the dirty 
 We fly like a birdy, hummers spinning thirties 
 Tony montana, esham bandana 
 Body-snatcher, running through your mind like Scanners 
 Original murder planners, the villains they never ran us 
 I do it like a pimp like Little Flip and David Banna 
 Supersonic, byonic, electronic, to smoking chronic 
 Fuck the world, as I twirl, as I sip another tonic 
 Super wickid shit I spit, I make my victim wanna vomit 
 Soopa doopa! 
 Super laboratory, spitting on a super microphone 
 Super stretch limo, pick me up to take me to the supa dome 
 I'm a Soopa Villain, holdin' on the Soopa Chrome 
 Fuck with me and get your brains blown hoes!
