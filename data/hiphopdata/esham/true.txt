Im buzzin, I need some True 
 Not like the shit that you smoke that you grew 
 Straight from Jamaica where the green grass grow 
 Cop me some Tops and I'm ready to go 
 Roll me a big fat bat of the true up 
 Hide my bag while I call the crew up 
 Blaze my J and take a strong toke 
 Then (coughs) choke off the true smoke 
 But ain't no thang, I'm game to take another puff 
 And as I smoke I say damn that's some good stuff 
 I can roll a J in 3 seconds flat 
 At a baseball game I be blazin' a bat 
 In school, I'm cool, smoke a J in the can 
 No homegrown please just straight up Ghan 
 Keep a bic in my pocket 'cause I'm ready to flick 
 Keep the true in my drawls by my balls and my dick 
 If you try to smoke me you can be straight up lit 
 I smoke the type of shit you can't fuck with 
 If you take a strong toke it'll turn your lungs blue 
 And that fresh smellin True green grass is on you 
 No tellin' how much True I consume 
 The shit's so potent you'll catch a contact in the next room 
 When I blaze it's just like smog 
 Niggaz wake up in the morning and thinks it's early morning fog 
 I gotta have it, gotta smoke it, gotta have it 
 I can afford to be blowed 'cause my lifestyle's lavish 
 True's in the house when I walk in the place 
 Blaze up a J and blow smoke in ya face 
 My lifestyle's wild I can never go wrong 
 And I smoke more True than Cheech and Chong 
 I gotta get some more True 'cause my bag's gettin' low 
 Jump in the ride headed for the True store 
 Give me a pound of your best Sensimillia 
 'Cause I come everyday you oughta hook me up a deal 
 Just then the cops had to raid the place 
 So I puffed on my J and blew smoke in they face 
 They put us in cop car, me and my man Jack and Pete 
 Blazin' up True in the backseat 
 The cop jumped in and he wasn't jokin 
 He said go to jail or give me that shit you been smokin' 
 I said cool and didn't even think about it 
 As for the True, never leave home without it
