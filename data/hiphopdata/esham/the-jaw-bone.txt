Yo baby wassup, how ya doin' girl 
 Your the finest thing I ever seen in the whole world 
 See ya look so good like a cherry pie 
 I just had to speak because you caught my eye 
 You got the big plump booty with the lovely curves 
 Other niggaz scared to speak 'cause they ain't got enough nerve 
 But I'm different and magnificent, the brotha they wanna be 
 And if you ain't jockin now, well baby you gonna be 
 I'm somthin like a sex feind, kinda your we dream 
 Turn you inside out and make your pussy steam 
 I said pussy ain't got no face and I meant every word of it 
 You betta go ask someone I'm sure that they've heard of it 
 Enough about me, what's your name 
 I kept runnin' game and game and game and game and game 
 She said "The same old thing from the same old guys"(not me) 
 "Tellin' lies to get between my thighs" 
 I said "baby what's up, but I'm different though" 
 She said "Yeah, I know, I've heard it befoe" 
 I said "Yeah I am, I'm tellin' the truth, I'm tellin' it like it is" 
 She said "Yeah you might but you might kiss and tell yo biz" 
 I said "look baby it ain't like that 'cause all I want from you" 
 "Is the J-A-W-B-O-N-E" 
 The jawbone, yup, yeah the jawbone 
 Do me baaaby when we get alone 
 The jawbone, what, yeah the jawbone 
 Do me baaaby when we get alone 
 Well if ya ain't doin' it now 
 In the future you will do it 
 And when your dead and buried 
 Where ever you go you'll still do it 
 Suck my dick like a dick is supposed to be sucked 
 Open up wide, and let your tongue get fucked 
 Suck my dick like a lolly pop 
 And when I bust a nut you still don't stop 
 You gotta slip, slip, slurp and slurp, slip, slip 
 Take a pause to spit and wipe the nut from your lip 
 You say you can't suck a dick, then you's a god damn lie 
 You don't need no instructions, and this is why 
 If you can lick your fingers after lickin' the finger lickin' chicken 
 You can lick my dick, so start lickin' 
 It's like suckin yo thumb, same thang suck my bone 
 If you can't gimme no jawbone, then you can go home 
 The jawbone, yup, yeah the jawbone 
 Do me baaaby when we get alone 
 The jawbone, what, yeah the jawbone 
 Do me baaaby when we get alone 
 So baby what's up, what's it gon' be 
 You and me, the J-A-W the B-O-N-E 
 So what's the deal, I said I like the real feel 
 Although I got protection 
 I know your mouth wont give me no infection 
 (All this and that, that this might be true) 
 (But how do I know it's safe fuckin' around wit you) 
 (You might gimme somthin, how do I know) 
 Well baby you can suck it with a condom on ho 
 I don't give a fuck how you suck it, just suck it 
 Open your mouth as I comense to fuck it 
 Baby what's up, just gimme a low blow to the head 
 Gimme jawbone until your cheeks turn red 
 I'm almost through so what you gon' do 
 Put my bone in your mouth and say ohfoofoo 
 Oh I forgot it's not polite to talk with your mouth full 
 Suck in your face like a fish and let your cheeks pull 
 There she blow's on my Moby 
 Gotta dick whip the bitch like Toby 
 But I can't stay, I gotta be on my way 
 But I'll be back for jawbone another day 
 The jawbone, yup, yeah the jawbone 
 Do me baaaby when we get alone 
 The jawbone, what, yeah the jawbone 
 Do me baaaby when we get alone
