That ain't happenin' 
 Well 
 Muthafuckas tryin' to kill me and shit, 
 Out here 
 Well 
 10 years ago a friend of mine 
 Spit somethin' called acid rap 
 Rapped about the darkest shit I ever done heard of, 
 Swear I never heard of nuttin' like that 
 Just a kid at home on a microphone 
 Rappin' these boomin' words from hell 
 Sellin' tapes out his trunk for a couple of months, 
 But soon ghetto millionaires crown well 
 Esham Smith and his brother James, 
 Payin' outta half the state 
 With a brand new style called the wicked shit, 
 Sellin' faster than the shit could be made 
 What's Esham like? Is he really like that? 
 Is Oshay really a natural born killa? 
 With them it's OK all day, with Esham no way, 
 Cause his shit be soundin' way realla 
 He does the Devil's shit, 
 Do you believe in God? 
 It's the story of Esham The Unholy 
 And if you askin' me, how the fuck I know? 
 Because the muthafucka just told me, 
 Biatch!
