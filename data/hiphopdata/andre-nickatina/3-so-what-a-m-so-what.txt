It can get real cold if you not standin' in the lobby 
 Girl you Kamikaze 'cause 
 I know you work your body yeah 
 You need to put me in your mind 
 Hit you with some baby oil 
 Yo everything shine 
 Dolce and Gabana 
 Ho it won't impress your mama 
 You roll around the city like your Lola Falana 
 It's 3 so what? 
 A.M so what? 
 Me and you talking conversation so tough 
 Really on the under girl I feen for your attention 
 But I gotta get paid for it 
 That admission 
 You can't be a Christian 
 Did I forget to mention 
 You gotta be a sinner 
 And a bread winner 
 No T-bone dinners 
 Maybe Top Ramen 
 Late night counting money with my bottom 
 It's 3 so what? 
 A.M. so what? 
 Me and you talking conversation so tough 
 It's sorta like ice the way we skate through the city 
 Even hockey players gotta say you look pretty 
 You gettin' every penny 
 You always say "gimme" 
 You wash the Heni down baby girl with the Remi 
 I hate to miss the phone when I see that you called 
 'Cause I know it's conversation that'll make me wanna ball 
 You make money fall like snow in Minnesota 
 12 a.m. and there ain't no rollers 
 It's something like music when your heels hit the street 
 A symphony plays when you walk the concrete 
 And I love yo eyes 'cause yo eyes don't lie 
 I remember when I asked and you said that you'll try 
 Baby work your body like a rookie running back 
 My life is coping blows 
 Soul ain't never coming back 
 They all ran track like the? Olympics 
 I spit the gift so that made them all gifted 
 Now I remixed it 
 Put it in a capsule 
 Pineapple to the big red apple 
 Finish that Snapple 
 Don't leave thirsty 
 I still? the game first cursed me 
 It's 3 so what? 
 A.M. so what? 
 Me and you talking conversation so tough 
 Ya know I'm from the city of Joe Montana 
 My curls bang out like gang bandanas 
 Freak you bananas 
 Paying is a privilege 
 I look you in the eyes and say "the game did this" 
 Coconut future 
 Real Karma Sutra 
 I used to buy clothes from this fine ass booster 
 Now I'm with the roosters 
 When it comes to you 
 The way you hit the streets and the things that you do 
 Even politicians try to get you through the wire 
 Come back and tell me 'cause you know they all liars 
 Turning like tires so fast no brakes 
 Sometimes we laugh about the money you make 
 Cakes I bake 
 T-Bone steaks 
 Fallas that race to your face then chase 
 Let me lace you up 
 Roll up two blunts 
 Some think it late 
 But it's 3 so what?
