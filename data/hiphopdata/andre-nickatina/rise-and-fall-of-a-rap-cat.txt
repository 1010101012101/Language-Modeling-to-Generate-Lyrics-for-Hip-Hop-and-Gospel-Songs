(Andre Nickatina) 
 Believe me my in raise 
 No change 
 How can I have so much lust for the game 
 I'm so ashamed 
 No skate 
 It's too late 
 I've been a play 
 How can I have so much lust for the game 
 I'm so ashamed 
 No squan 
 My god 
 The god of Kahn 
 How can I have so much lust for the game 
 I'm so ashamed 
 All rain 
 Stuck in the game 
 With all pain 
 How can I have so much lust for the game 
 I'm so ashamed 
 Believe me my in raise
