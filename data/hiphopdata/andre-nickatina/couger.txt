They call me Tennessee tornado 
 You can call me Dr J if you a baller, and it's getting fatal 
 My big 6 crush the whole table 
 'Cause my domino effect is from the grey back to the cradle 
 I rap MC lullabies 
 So these cats bring 38's, tek nines and 45's 
 The grass is green, so we stay high 
 Freak, how you gonna buy a burger, didn't get the damn fries 
 I leave ya stiff when I elevate 
 5-0 at the door, tigers all hit the fire 'scape 
 I got my money, my weed, I got my wallet 
 Staggering like an alcoholic, just can't call it, yo 
 We do these things and we don't give a fuck 
 We fire up a blunt, in the car bumpin' Cougnut 
 I got on my blue star Chucks 
 We fire up a blunt, in the car bumpin' Cougnut 
 My rap mag plays laser tag 
 So they can find your hand and the mic' in the brown bag 
 I wear my pants with a slight sag 
 I expose your shows with flows, man, 'cause I love cash 
 I rhyme gamble like Pete Rose 
 And I sport new clothes on you MC fine hoes 
 I locate like transmitters 
 And you know with my wood your heart fill the five spitter? 
 I ain't nothin' but a go-getter 
 Some think I'm touched so they label me a gold nigger 
 Keep skis like a gold digger 
 Like credit card scams that exceed in the 4 figures
