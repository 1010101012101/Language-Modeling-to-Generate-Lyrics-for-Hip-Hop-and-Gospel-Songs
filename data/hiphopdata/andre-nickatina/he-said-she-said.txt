Don'tcha let 'em jerk you around 
 And that's how lies get started 
 That's how lies get started sho' 
 **How do lies get started 
 Well, he said she said 
 And lies can send you spinnin sometimes 
 Around and around and around and around 
 Now how do lies get started yeah 
 He said she said 
 Don't let 'em jerk you around** 
 Now how do rumors get started 
 Started by the jealous people 
 Lookin' for a ? when a man and a women have a good relationship 
 And they trip then they flip tryin' to cook a situation in the mix 
 Now that's a hater for ya 
 Ooh and I know it's hard to resist 
 But these foxy ladies ooh they sure persist 
 They bring drama and they momma with a boyfriend and a girlfriend 
 And they turn a nice day into a rainy day whirlwind 
 I'll Tell you one time only with my bezzy donizzy 
 I'm with my babygirl so I'm tryin' to kick it live 
 Drink in my right hand, left on her thigh 
 So do yourself a favor with the ? away from me 
 Now did you hear that one about Bruce 
 Bruce said he talked the root and always squeezed tha juice 
 That came straight from a guy who probably never knocked it loose 
 Another hater 
 Man I'm in kick it mode 
 I strike a wicked pose 
 'Cause I'm out on the town tryin' to get choked 
 In Teflon clothes with the scent of a rose 
 And my ladies with me that's how it goes 
 Now I can't go no place without somebody pointin' a finger 
 Ah, but I can't blame em 
 My rides got sweet interior 
 I think I'll call my broker and I'll tell him to watch the figures 
 So the next time the rumors get started he'll chill and remember 
 So stop spreadin those rumors around 
 Stop spreadin the lies 
 What's mine is mine 
 I ain't got time for rumors in life 
 I keep to myself 
 Bother nobody else 
 So please let me live my life 
 I think I'll write my congress man and tell him to pass a bill 
 So the next time I get somebody startin' rumors shoot to kill 
 You don't wanna see me 
 You don't wanna see me no
