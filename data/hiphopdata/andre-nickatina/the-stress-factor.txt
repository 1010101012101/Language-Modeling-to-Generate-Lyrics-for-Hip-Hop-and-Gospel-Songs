Don't me 'cause I'm close to the edge 
 I'm trying not to lose my head 
 Sometime I sit alone 
 And look deep into my soul 
 And I starrin' down at something 
 That's very out a control 
 Tolerence at zero 
 Emotions dead and gone 
 If indo was a pebble 
 Man consiter me stoned 
 Patience low I rest to go 
 I got's to get Ahead 
 Motherfuck these hoes 
 And them po-pos I gots to get my bread 
 The streets say nothing nice 
 They quit it like the idus 
 And everybody dippin seein 
 Who can get the highest 
 But check this out 
 Without a doubt 
 And about to come fresher 
 And about that cab 
 And protect that ass 
 Don't pannic under pressure 
 My stabbin like a whip 
 Or better an aligator 
 Temper going up and down like a 
 Like a fucking elevator 
 Bitch I want it now 
 Don't give me no delay's 
 My hustlin got me trippin' 
 Listen from my ike turner way's 
 Man this life is real 
 No time to be an actor 
 And I'll play no man 
 Let me know 
 It's like the stress factor 
 I want to grow old 
 Have a kid and a place to sleep 
 A down ass wife 
 And when I die I'll rest in peace 
 But man that's all a dream 
 This donja got me bleak 
 It got me feelin' good 
 But I forgot what I did last week 
 Now look at my face 
 This shit ain't fake 
 The pain to turn to pressure 
 Every nigga that know me 
 Don't cop down to that pressure 
 My mother woke me up 
 One day said "boy you gettin' grown" 
 Your momma has 3 jobs 
 Your momma is gettin' old 
 So I took it as a hint 
 When oh my missions free 
 Mind full of hatred 
 Got me fuckers time is hard you see 
 That monkeys on my back 
 And I can't get him off 
 So whatever I do 
 Mom it's just for you 
 No matter what the cost 
 I put that on my life 
 Everything I see is dark 
 Money is rare 
 But I don't care 
 Stop that niggaz heart 
 He's comin' on a big wheel 
 I'm comin' like a tractor 
 Man take this hate 
 Run it's too late 
 It's called the stress factor 
 Some think that I'm The Man 
 Some think my shit don't stink 
 But yes it do 
 I thought you knew 
 I'm not a coward nor a fink 
 One side of my heart got love 
 The other side is hate 
 Boy that hate is steamin love 
 Right in it's fuckin' face 
 Women ask me how I'm livin' 
 I tell them day by day 
 With a donja joint 
 That lovely voice 
 A mr. Marvin gay 
 And I got to get away 
 That just might do some good 
 But every time I gets away 
 I miss the fuckin' hood 
 My homie lost his job 
 He don't know how to react 
 So I do thangs to help him out 
 Like took a little crack 
 That shit's over rated 
 Niggas Complicated 
 But you woulod never know 
 From that cat flow 
 How the pictures painted 
 Motherfuckers wisper 
 And think I don't hear them 
 And wonder why I'm over high 
 And never go near them 
 Much love to all my niggas 
 From workin to mid jackers 
 Cause matter what you feel 
 'Cause it's called the stress factor
