I think this is fairly accurate, but there are some mistakes if some wishes to correct them. 
 Listen to this stuff 
 Tales of two andres... 
 With the money and the drugs I can't resist 
 Like a frog princess that needs a woman's kiss 
 The way I get down is a tragedy 
 They say, "Yeah nigger, Your Majesty" 
 Mind goin' blind in the whim 
 Cover my eyes with the front of my brim 
 My still is the lady, yeah sun duck kim 
 I'ma say it right here 
 Why you fuckin' with him? 
 Why you fuckin' with him? 
 I'm a jewel-lord jim 
 Like somethin' that's priceless worn by Isis 
 Blowin' on weed in the eye of the storm 
 Gettin' snuck in the back of girl's college dorms 
 Homie now what? 
 Roll this blunt. 
 Nigga watcha drinkin' out your new pimp cup? 
 Alcohol yeah, with a little cranberry 
 Hit it long enough it start to taste like cherry 
 I'm in the door 
 Blow on the horn 
 These freaks be thinkin' that I'ma Capricorn 
 Man in a whim 
 I tip my brim 
 Still laxing kim, why ch'ou fuckin' with him? 
 Why you fuckin' with him? 
 Pass the joint 
 Fillmoe Lakeview Hunter's point 
 24/7 there's junk to sell 
 An' no fairy tale 
 An' I wish you well 
 Because when I make bail 
 It's like the flames of hell 
 Or bullet shells that tip the scale 
 Or be washed around 
 'Cause it's electric 
 You can detect it 
 You mother fecked it 
 It's gettin' kind of hectic 
 He's gettin' kind of restless 
 Mother fuckers out there say dat he's the bestest 
 I rides around in my car, 
 Thinkin' about money and m√©nage a trios 
 No I'm not a star 
 Blaze this fly 
 Me and my nigga talk shit at the bar 
 Hah 
 Nah freak you can't braid my hair 
 So you can have me outta line like Huggy Bear? 
 I got clothes to wear 
 That don't compare 
 I get a flat, get a new car 
 Fuck a Spare 
 In my fresh new keen, nicky underwear 
 Ya pipe for a vine? 
 Little sher khan says "why smoke vine, it doesn't hurt your moms 
 And it keeps me calm 
 And that's how I'm God" 
 You gotta keep it sticky like Charlotte's Web 
 Blow a sack on a track, on a baller's bed 
 Hold out your hand baby, I'll read your palm 
 Like Kymo don, 
 My game is on 
 There're 32 papers in a zig-zag pack 
 It take two hos to make one track 
 They say Huey Newton took two in the back 
 What's up with that? 
 My dialog is in the rap catalog 
 And tell the grim reaper you'll catch the God 
 So fresh. (So fresh) So clean, (So clean) 
 You'll see Nicky T on flight six-14 
 Like Billy Sims I tip my brim 
 And Sunny Kim, why you fuckin' with him? 
 Across state, 'cross county lines 
 In your alpine is the master mind 
 Picture my Van Gough, Your flow design 
 You wanna hear a cat rhyme that I hope is mine 
 Come here, yeah baby is my open line 
 You gotta pretty face 
 Dis' Pisces Hyphee 
 Gin and coke Wu-tang in the Nikes 
 I could never cheat the game in my life, see? 
 O-khan I react like a Pikie 
 My ki' 
 Then Sunny called, Did you hear the phone 
 Because a real rap lord's been left a long 
 It's like rap-capone 
 With dallas chrome 
 Or Love Jones all in your bones 
 Treat a girl like a freak, then send her home 
 Like a ice-cream cone 
 My heart is cold 
 I'm kind of bold
