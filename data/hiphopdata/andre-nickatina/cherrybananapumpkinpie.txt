You know I laugh like a fat king 
 And when I rap it's like the sound when a gat sings 
 Undercover, yeah you know like butter 
 Stretch like rubber 
 I make sure payments like the ultimate cutter 
 I stand like a statue in the church I feel cold 
 Trapped like a cat wit a boat full of coke 
 Tigas know I lie 
 Cherrybananapumpkinpie 
 This is how I run my life 
 Razor sharp just like the knives 
 Mics get hit from buller flavor I spit 
 Chambers and clips can't offer me shit 
 I get high as fuck when them MC's come 
 But from dawn to dusk man I breaks 'em up 
 Like booyah! What ya do now!? 
 I can hear them freaks screamin Hoocha! 
 From head to head 
 Dread to dread 
 Lead to Lead 
 Spread to spread 
 Niggas be trippin' when the endos gone 
 Niggas be trippin' when they womans gone 
 Niggas be trippin' when the moneys gone 
 That's why I rappin' on the microphone 
 What up, razor sharp 
 Crack Raider 
 Time to build my juice back up 
 Like the curl of a banger in a compton cut 
 How many niggas do I have to kill 
 Before I go to the top of the hill 
 Don't need to be alarmed because my game is tight 
 You know I do it for the gods when I rock the mic 
 You know I'm really wheel spinnin and my hammer keep bustin' 
 You be a fool and these cats I'm trustin 
 Cold as ice he must be cold as steel 
 I'm gon bury yo ass at the top of the hill come on 
 Razor sharp 
 Rap Raider razor 
 Raider sharp 
 Rap raider razor raider sharp 
 A tiga like me can't hit the block 
 Sucka MC's is like microphone cops 
 Niggas know Nicky got a brain for glocks 
 So when I think niggas come at they usual spots 
 Nose stay red like the 1st reindeer 
 Don't know where you goin' but ya can't stay here 
 Gotta hit the scene all stars and jeans 
 Slip through the scene like vaseline cream 
 Supreme being one man team 
 The king diamonds wit the heart of his queen 
 No matter the ride check it I'm gon lean 
 Wit a hook that niggas ain't seen since kareem 
 I'm a fugitive gotta watch my step 
 Suckas wanna know where the rhymes is kept 
 Check this out playboy hold ya breath 
 I'm on the bay bridge they ain't caught me yet 
 Goin' ninety on the freeway chokin 
 Ain't no mystery to the weed we smokin' 
 Andre nickatina said show me some styles 
 And check this out freak I'ma be right back 
 I hate to be a whore but the worlds a pimp 
 I'm tryin' to tell my tigas man don't y'all simp 
 Comin' like a mack truck 
 Miss me if ya foul skunk 
 Represent the blunt when ya get tossed up 
 Microphone flow like the caddy will rip 
 And this sugar hill gang got me doin' this so 
 Razor sharp, rap raider razor sharp 
 Rap razor raider razor sharp... sharp
