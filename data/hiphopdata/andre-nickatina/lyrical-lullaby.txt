(Feat. Savage C) 
 Savage-C: 
 A whole defensive line couldn't stop my rhymes, 
 I leave tricks flatlined with columbine lines 
 And crack spines, 
 I leave mics numb with morphine, 
 Your team could step and get blazed like nicotine, 
 Burned like gasoline in the tank of my beam, 
 Sunk like submarines while I fuck a marine, 
 I'm A Team, about to blow up like caroseen, 
 My flows is hittin like a pipe with no smokescreen 
 More lines than magazines, droppin' verses like fumbles 
 ... I turnbuckles in lyrical royal rumbles 
 While you bitches stumble, we shake 'em like runnin' backs 
 Kickin up more dust than Carl Lewis runnin' track 
 My flash then Kodak, kickin lip when I'm pimpin', 
 Bustas could'ntsee me with mothafuckin restrictions 
 I pop the clip in for suckas who start friction 
 To keep you bustas movin like this was an eviction 
 Andre Nickatina: 
 I'm from "don't five a fuck dot com" 
 I spit these raps like two gats plus the holy Qur'an 
 It's essential I bust like a block monsta, 
 Duck low from the blaze of this helicopta 
 Like Agatha Christie, you're dyin' a mystery, 
 Because these streets are real, seriously 
 Buggs Bunny mothafuck you know who I am, 
 Rap gun slanger yo Simity Sam 
 Yo, spicy like Cajun rice, cold as ice 
 You rev like the Dodge Daytona with the pipes 
 My empires strikes back for tigas and Jedis 
 Lyrics that kill rhymes, 2 to the 4 5 
 My soul is the soul of a replicon, 
 Decepticon, and you ain't even met Shere Khan 
 'Cause I'll bounce you like a Polo stick off a brick, 
 Then lose you in the smoke of the cannabis 
 Yo, the popeye crooked eye, strapped with a alibi 
 The only MC to shoot you a lullaby 
 Darth Vader force, of course, round the neck 
 MC slugs, of course, round the chest 
 This is how we blaze for Jah, rock your Kah 
 And tell those freaks to, yeah, drop your brah 
 The pisces killa whale is like a diary 
 And I'm a boss at what I do, you can't fire me 
 Savage-C: 
 I grab the mic and spit flows till I decompose, 
 I been screamin "fuck the hos" since I was an embryo 
 And fuck the radio, I'm stayn strictly underground 
 And, 
 Fuck a trick, I wouldn't save a bitch if she was drownin 
 2 10s poundin in my 325 
 Rippin 10 times 65, combined with 4 and 5 
 Comin' straight from the west like a south paw crackin' jaws, 
 A player with a bigger sack than Santa Claus 
 My shits raw, that's why I'm bout ta blow like land mines 
 Equipped with more lines than the New York Times 
 My rhymes is dope like a syringe of heroin 
 'Cause I got my shit together like Siamese twins 
 You fake like a mannequin, your flows ain't tight 
 Bitch ass MC's could'ntsee me in daylight 
 And this collaboration, is for a classic compilation, 
 5-0s hatin', I'm hittin fences like immigration
