Man I'm a coke rap spitter 
 A hair pin trigger 
 A crime rhyme dealer 
 Is iller but on the realler 
 Spin around jordan they at a loss 
 For the words 
 Rap it up light though, 
 Fly like a bird 
 Nothing but baking soda the 
 Motorola do it well 
 Up in your face man with something 
 To sell 
 I'm like a chronic vision pigeon tiga 
 Just spinnin time with 45, 3, 57 
 And 9s 
 My figure 8, is real it's not fake 
 Strawberry soda garlic bread and 
 Steak 
 Ahead in the chase and I hide 
 Behind the wheel 
 You talk more money and we can 
 Make a deal 
 (Make a deal square ass n*) 
 I'm not a screw face, I keep my 
 Boots lased 
 And listen to the homies brag about 
 They gun case 
 They off taste, crank beat with more bass 
 My court date, and I came in hella late 
 No false game, wear rains with no chains 
 Holla at the guard if u a rap cat mayne 
 Nickel plated, now the (?) is penetrated 
 I put that on my life I'm glad you never made it 
 Raw hide, all in my blood line 
 You never find a drug of me like no kind 
 Don't hide, cause it makes it more divine 
 To put you in the firing line on valentines 
 February, or was it January 
 I lose my memory when it come to you canaries 
 Its necessary, on guard with what you carry 
 Split the middle of the suture and add the blueberry 
 I'm not a damn fool, I live by they rules 
 Base slang, and I'm doin' my big thang 
 Make change, get bread to kick game 
 I knows you got ass but yous a lame freak dame 
 No shame, and I'm greedy to the brain 
 You know the pit bull is off the chicka-chicka-chain 
 Crate-a-lane, on the freeway of pain 
 I don't spend dollars on expenseive champagne 
 Rip hearts and I pound the sky larks 
 Petal to the medal in my wu-tang clarks 
 New suede, from the stage to the grave 
 Hot days, means pistols in the shade 
 It ain't strange, motherfucker you sell cane 
 Add a little color to the picture frame 
 The rhyme cheater, throw on the wife beater 
 T-shirt jeans tennis shoes then see ya 
 And this analogy, is a new strategy 
 And this academy is headed for a tragedy 
 It sounds to me that you're tryin' to break free 
 And snakes like me don't allow that see 
 At close range you can see my vertigo 
 Venom in the soul and I'm ready to let it go 
 With no control, man it can grow like a rose 
 And I'm standing right there in my Filmo' pose 
 When a child cries, in the heart a father dies 
 Punch you in the eye to let you know that you alive 
 Lethal, both the prada eagles 
 Bumpin C-BO on the way to Tahoe 
 I'm stage left, at the store remian chef 
 Man cook it up and keep it from the A-T-F 
 The barracuda, yo the rhyme roof shoota 
 Runnin' down the stairs of the project do a 
 Kamakaze, rip your stargens for a hobby 
 And rip it in the lobby man while kickin it with bobby 
 You say the word, then here come the words put 
 Mustard on they rap and then FLY LIKE A BIRD
