Some MC's don't rap it up, hold up a front like they really gonna give a fuck, but not me 
 Fucken it up and let it run, talkin' to much like when they hold the blunt 
 But not me 
 Head up in your sound proof, FUCK, make a mistake and take twenty-five takes, but not me 
 Talken loud, and they about, what, everything and that's so damn free 
 I'm like kasta troy, liven to enjoy 
 Consider myself the number one b-boy 
 Relate the word, I give a new definition 
 Wack on the mic and you got me suspicious 
 Smack in the head, wake him up, give a fuck 
 When I'm goin' on, get in the mood ima blow the zone 
 Its everyday all day, learn it the hard way, I make the bet parlay 
 Grabbin that ashtray for the blunt and OJ 
 Run the game so cold, just like OJ wait your turn 
 Everything gonna rotate, locate 
 If you focus it'll go straight, smoke this 
 And it'll really make your head light, I won't stop when successful and set tight 
 You wanna jeapardize everything, gamble away, with the scissors who don't even bet right yeah right 
 See I could never fret, so don't sweat 
 The technique 'cause it's all step by step 
 I'm like archie, baby, gotta live it by my rep 
 There can't be a day in my life I regret 
 I can't really help if you see me as a threat 
 Kamikaze with no safety net 
 When I rap I can see your identification 
 Gotta make it clear so there's no mistaken 
 Some MC's don't rap it up, hold up a front like they really gonna give a fuck, but not me 
 Fucken it up and let it run, talkin' to much like when they hold the blunt 
 But not me 
 Head up in your sound proof, FUCK, make a mistake and take twenty-five takes, but not me 
 Talken loud, and they about, what, everything and that's so damn free
