What time is it! 
 This is one of those, A1-Yola raps... Stick in ya mind, stick in ya mind, 
 Stick in ya mind... 
 When you up all night 
 You see things you shouldn't have saw 
 'Cause the night gets raw 
 Drama is thicker than Skippys peanut butter 
 Imagine worried thoughts of a young man's mother 
 Feelin's empty, Love don't live here anymore 
 Awake like an owl at a quarter to four 
 Don't blink, A Caddy just ran a red light 
 Bumpin' thug life 
 And I blend (?) with the night 
 They call me greedy 
 ...(?) To get a gurl a beaty 
 It's Andre Nickatina 
 I'm like a genie in a beanie 
 Amarato 88 Cadillac, all black 
 Copy cats try to match 
 But they style ain't exactly the same 
 Somebody said "Freeze it's a raid" 
 You know cops are comin' when a brotha smells 
 Glazed doughnuts 
 Hold up 
 I'ma fill it to the rim 
 Me and money go together like a feather in a brim 
 I'm a magician 
 ...(?) But I ain't trippin' 
 A gurl be yellin'...(?) I don't listen 
 Crooked crow 
 Playas seem to like my style 
 Why's that killa whale? 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo, Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo, Hoo! 
 (What are ya baby?) 
 I'm a Raider 
 Camouflaged in silver and the black 
 Tryin' to blitz through the line for a quarter back sack 
 Of the money 
 I dress like it's cold, Not sunny 
 But slyer than an urgent fox tryin' to catch a bunny 
 In the snow 
 I'm try'na get paid like a ho 
 Or better yet the pimp that's rakin' in her dough 
 Like a baker 
 But check it, who's the king of the caine? 
 And what's that tiga's name with the Macintosh computer brain mind 
 Or should I say mine 
 Sometimes I gotta lie to protect my crime 
 I call my lawyer! 
 Bail bonds keep me on the streets 
 Three in the mornin' I'm at the club with the freaks 
 But I got hawk eye 
 Meanin' that the joint is bein' watched 
 Drinkin' with the killas that be pushin' up the cost 
 For the drought season 
 ...(?) Season 
 ...(?) Up they best 
 But those be the ones that don't have to rest 
 Like an owl... 
 Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo, Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo, Hoo! 
 I set a trap 
 I have to spin a web like a spider 
 Don't strike matches, hate child proof lighters 
 Stay awake 
 Quick (?) as I pick up the pace 
 First I see a gurl's butt, then I look at her face 
 I can't explain 
 I'm eatin' garlic bread with the steak 
 ... (????) ... 
 Brothas droppin' cream by the fiends when they part 
 I'm like a sentinel 
 Known to be the principal original 
 Lookin' for the road that made it...(?) 
 Call it federal, I'm a general 
 But yet at times I blaze with my lieutenant 
 Popeye, no more blunts (?), who got the spinach 
 ...(?) Choke, feelin' no remorse for the roach 
 Choppin' up freaks as ya lounge with your folks 
 Playin' dice, you take a chance at the crap (?) game 
 It's all about the money baby, it's the rap game 
 And I'm an owl... 
 Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo, Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo, Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo, Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo! 
 I stay awake like an owl, Hoo, Hoo! 
 Uh... And I'm out 
 Uh, Shit 
 It's a planned emergency, (It's a planned emergency) 
 It's a planned emergency, (It's a planned emergency) 
 What, STOP!
