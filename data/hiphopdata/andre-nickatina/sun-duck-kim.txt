 Chorus: (in korean) 
 Meh ho whame... who ho san se 
 Guyow mo duk juck se mew mo huk ics 
 Sun duck kim chang! 
 Read you like a TV giude you can't hide 
 Betta use your cellular I tapped your phone line 
 It's the ginger bread man, hoe catch me if you can 
 My kangol makes me look like MC Shan 
 Rock tha atmosphere in my teflon gear 
 Don't drink coffee but I love pam grier 
 Let me give it to your ear drumin 
 You hear somthin' 
 Try to stop it but it just keeps commin 
 Just keeps dumpin 
 Just keeps bumpin 
 Just keeps crumplin' 
 Tiga, bitch, relentless like a heat seaking missile then grissle 
 Poppin' like a 4-5 pistle with a pencil 
 Blowin' kisses to my old bitches 
 Good wishes, my red devil fish, man I feeds 'em gold fishes 
 Baby did you call 
 I can hear ya whistle down the hall 
 Sporting leather like an nba basketball 
 Freeze frame, something like a homocide shot 
 On the move and alert when the set gets hot 
 It's like chess, concentrate before you take a step 
 Because killings on the street is in full effect 
 Smoke 2 joints to the dearly departed 
 Bust nine rhymes and I'm just gettin' started 
 Emcees come in packs of seven 
 And every time I send 'em to the gates of heaven 
 It's the ripper, creased like a fresh pair of dickies 
 Most say andre, some say nicky, ricky, pass me a towel 'cause I'm sweatin 
 Dice game goin' on and I'm side bettin 
 Little joe back doo nigga flow or blow 
 Hoe wutchu know about the black fo-fo 
 Left for a sec but its welcome back carter 
 And just like a baller I came back a starter 
 Fully loaded, tricks up the sleeve like a thief 
 Fifth dipped daytons, zap code beat 
 Microphone tec like straight kung-fu 
 Nigga fuck me no nigga fuck you 
 It's the nickatina beama masterpiece of rap 
 So when you hear raps, you betta cock yours back (click click) 
 Deeper than a root canal, you know the style 
 Starin' at the judge in court with a smile 
 My mazda rx-7's name is pitiful pete 
 A one seater 'cause it beat in the passenger seat 
 I came sober, my ?vestiges? I came to get over 
 I don't drink king cobra bitch I am the king cobra 
 Like dracula in an acura, cocaine white spectacula
