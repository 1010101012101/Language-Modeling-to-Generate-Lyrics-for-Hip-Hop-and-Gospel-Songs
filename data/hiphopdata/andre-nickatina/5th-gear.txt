Fast lane baby, ain't nothin' like it, some play it cool, 
 Some get excited, hit 5th gear and you might get indited, 
 Spend all your cash try to fight it and how ya like it, 
 The nickatina roll dice - shoot craps, a brand new rap means a 
 Brand new gat, some rather sit around and snitch like rats, 
 Ain't no tellin' where I'm at on the map, my chuck taylors days 
 Stay lays devine, look in the eyes of a rap gad laced with 
 Rhyme, and it's a felony, and its in druthers what they tellin' me, and in my mind yo that's a penalty, 
 Man baby so mean, she wear those apple bottom jeans, 90 
 Percent cream, bumpin' the 15, night time got parlay, plucka 
 Plucka, in the mix now ya cocksucka, 
 I never leave it alone home, I love a big baked roll, in your 
 Face freak with plain clothes, yeah fly like a kite no cops in 
 Sight, racin' through the city runnin'every red light, drivin' 
 Like I hate my life, got a cairn in my vein and my brain ain't 
 No wife, night time got parlay, plucka plucka, in the mix now 
 Ya cocksucka, 
 You get flavour like a skittle when I rip a rhyme riddle, your 
 Face is in da pillow den I shoot it in da middle, ya 26 words 
 In the alphabet, and I use all 26 to get there grips, cause 
 You can see me on the highway, the plane, the plane mein, 
 Nickatina lake for a slate again, with hot weatha, hot leatha 
 And hot chedda, you bring the beats with the hot borettas, 
 My souls controlled by the late billy holiday, me and eric 
 Strung got all the way, rainy alarm with the charm of a nickel 
 As barm, then I sell you somethin' that shoot straight in your 
 Arm, and get a plate from duct tape to wear the bait, some man 
 Made jars didn't give a little shake, I hope ya got somethin', 4 
 Pound on your waist, because I drive like I don't have breaks, 
 Cause its, the fast lane baby, ain't nothin' like it, some play 
 It cool, some get excited hit 5th gear and you might get 
 Indited, spend all your cash tryin' to fight it, 
 Uh, you see I'm cold blooded, gary petters go glovin', lovin' 
 To play it cool but we heat it like an oven, I bowl gord in 
 Borgeon, with all fairness, ain't no turnin' back, I burn a 
 Sack so careless, sly just like stone, high all alone, 
 Glowin', rap crews oblivious all outta they zone, and I was 
 Told to treat 'em cold, a blow, ever keepin' flow, there's no 
 Reason to tell a leader, go, this is a rush, the outspoken in 
 The pissed discussion, like N.W.A I'm always into somethin', 
 And I'm a record like a athlete, out shone stampy, rollin' with 
 Motha fuckas just doin' the damn thing, livin' life too fast to 
 Catch it but got it mastered, down, now get mad and lash out, 
 Classic, genuine rappin', watch the boy play, can't escape the 
 Game the range is point blank, 
 When it come to cash yeah man some might divide it, but when it 
 Come to me don't try it, gotta com-plaint, boys ride toys on 
 Chrome, baby you drunk, you need to go home, 15 quick and ill 
 Thug rug bone, first of the month and roll another blunt, 
 Tonight I got cranberry juice in my cup, you starin' at a rap, 
 Can't freak, what up, night time got parlay, plucka plucka, in 
 Tha mix now ya cocksucka, 
 Put on your seat belt, need help I'm about to go fast, no 
 Bitchin' motha fucka, so don't even ask, forget about the past, 
 You betta do the math, freaks tryin' to put their dirty hands 
 On the cash, more keys than a piano, you like to travel, think 
 All the fours that flows, reach the ammo, retreat to the 
 Shadows, fire in the battle, you might see me on your 
 Favourite news channel, 2, 7 or maybe even 5, money on my mind 
 You can see it in my eyes, talkin' much shit I don't eva have to 
 Lie, unless its to a judge, but then I gotta grudge, a game 
 Where there ain't no love, money, cars, strip bars and the 
 Hardest drugs, night time got parlay, plucka plucka, in the 
 Mix now ya cocksucka, night time got parlay
