Glorified 
 Glorified, Glorified, Glorified, 
 In the game of pain that rang the outlaws 
 Freaks come through at a 2 no draws 
 Stop for a sec tiga don't take a pause 
 If you don't see no pigs then there ain't no laws 
 Get beefy wit me 1 time when I rap 
 To all them other niggas is like bullets in the back 
 On the highway going fucka fucka fast 
 Blowing on a chopper when I'm mucka mucka mad 
 Make way steady on the dirty dirty cash 
 When nothing hurts tiga only when I laugh 
 I glorified the crime rate in my state 
 The mothafucka thinks is the fliest place 
 Die mothafucka you know I ain't concerned 
 You make a mothafucka really do learn 
 Popeye nigga and go home and eat spinach 
 Get back on the block I really can't finish 
 I'm ready to rap till the gods say quit 
 Until then freaks you gon hear my shit 
 Parden my manapose and parden my French 
 And god so check it out, put me in the mix 
 I'm shooting with my eyes closed at 5-0 
 Leaving every where I go smelling like a rose 
 Hanging out the car window what's up hoes 
 Stepped out and showed the hoes the gangsta pose 
 I glorified the crime rate in my state 
 The mothafucka thinks is the fliest place 
 Your lucky you brothas go boom bang bang 
 America is the game with a gold wet rang 
 Keep ur daughtars chain my eyes never change 
 Hard to break like a cuban link chain 
 Stay back fo a while the mayne in livin' color 
 Instead of right next to me mothafucka 
 Die y'all hi y'all fry y'all 
 Spit the truth tell the youth it's a lie y'all 
 The only advice I can give to a brotha 
 Is fire up the weed motha fucka 
 Check it 
 I glorified the crime rate in my state 
 The motha fucka thinks is the fliest place 
 Shit can you understand now, I'm glorified
