I can't remember the day 
 But I remember the night 
 The first time in my life had an MC fight 
 Caterpilla killa lyrics spit like venom 
 Only thang my mind said was nigga go and get em 
 I ducked and bust and started cussing at them magots 
 Niggas started pulling fresh rhymes out the cabinet 
 My flow got quicker like machine gun Killa 
 Some MC's got hit even tho they werent ready 
 Watch me wrap you up like a boa constrictor 
 And pose like a pimp in your girls prom pictcha' 
 I watch MC's die like soldiers in war 
 Everybody for them self so there ain't no score 
 This niggas was bust a verse that he didn't rehearse 
 And got snatched from the earth like an old lady purse 
 The freestyle had mothafuckas on their backs 
 But failed to attack from the gangsta rap 
 Last breath of an MC 
 I hit the weed like a champ as I let raps fly 
 And best believe when I die man in my mind I'll be high 
 I saw old MC's that had a wounded bad 
 And if I slipped I could tell they would take they chance 
 So like rambo 1 
 Man I drew first blood 
 And hit 'em in the neck with 2 rap slugs 
 MC's brought gats and that one had an axe 
 Before he took a swack man I got him in the back 
 With pimp game rhyme 
 The moneys all mines 
 12 o'clock midnight me and him bond 
 MC females they slipped in and heard 
 Before they got close MAN I put 'em on the curb 
 With 'em lookin' 
 You see my vocal box start cookin 
 Screems where heard from frisco down to brooklyn 
 I don't do it for the fun 'cause ima MC rival 
 Fuck if you a champion 
 I don't want your title 
 LAST breath of an MC 
 Feel me 
 A 12 gauge stage displayed wit all rage 
 Bet yo last dolla it will make front page 
 It lasted all night, Mcs filled the black 
 Some dead with they eyes open rap shellshocked 
 Hip hop was left handed 
 He packed 2 gats 
 Just incase he ran in the gangsta rap 
 Bodies lay some hurt 
 Still trying to get away 
 But if they get away 
 They will return anotha day 
 But I kill em 
 Hit 'em with just enough venom 
 Eyes wide open until the cops come and get em 
 I pause, my dialogue 'ttampt to catch my breath 
 But before I knew it a rhyme had penetrated my vest 
 Caught off guard by an MC flow oh no 
 My mind start to click like a black 4 4 
 Rapid repeated rhymes that went for his throat 
 And after he died I spit raps at his ghost 
 Man I'm hurt I can see the cops start to lurk 
 I hit one with a rap that had 'em squirmin' in the dirt 
 I start to Hurl 
 I think about my old girl 
 Baby you had the best pussy in the world 
 I felt my heart start TO collapse 
 Ima hate to leave the game like that 
 I felt another rhyme dig deep into my spine 
 Just when I was about to hit the pig with another line 
 I'll see ya next time
