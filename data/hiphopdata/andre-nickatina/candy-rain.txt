Man if you know me, you know we homies 
 Its yo tiga, man the one and only 
 It's like the candy rain, all in the house of pain 
 And the one that hustle will survive, mane 
 When it comes to wrecking records, I'm like a bomb threat 
 Freeze 'em all, torch them then I watch them melt 
 I love being boss, I hate to take a loss 
 Keep my mind the same way as Microsoft 
 It's a conspiracy, and that'll never die 
 I opened up the sky, man and tell god "hi" 
 He said "What's up King Nicky?", I said "Man I'm parlayin" 
 He say I'm living reckless, I say "Lord, what you sayin'?" 
 He said "I'm gonna have to take you to a better place" 
 "If you don't slow down boy, yo and cut your pace" 
 I got like hella quit, I fired up the weed 
 Must a Tiga slow down his fast speed? 
 I hit the gas pedal, said "I'm a rap rebel 
 And man he let me have it, hand-delivered to the devil
