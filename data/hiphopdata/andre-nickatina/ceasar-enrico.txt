The phone rang, it was a guy that I knew 
 And he said, that your guilt 
 Every fuckin' account 
 He says you're done 
 (Nndre Nickatina) 
 Tiger, I think you better get it right 
 'Cause shit go bump in the night 
 Came up out tha gutta' 
 Now it's all butta' 
 And with my blade I cut like no other 
 The runnin' of the bulls, muthafucka it's the matadoor 
 Pep my new reew shoes on the marbol floor 
 Roll around like a copo, eatin' on chicken 
 I shootin' with my eyes close 
 Hope I ain't missin' 
 Firin' up weed till the early mornin' 
 It's a lil bit lonely since my girl is gone 
 Got my so called enemies 
 Yeah I'm back 
 And you cop sucka fuckas gotta deal with that 
 'Cause I'm loose like gun powda' hittin' in tha' canon 
 Fly by me don't think about landin' 
 Think about crashin' 
 'Cause I'm about to fall 
 And not before I break these laws 
 Muthafucka it's the devils heart beating in your ear 
 Hear goes the contract sold my career 
 And I'm chillin' hear muthafucka in the physical form 
 Reew my hair back just so I can hide my horns 
 Na mean 
 I've seen the rymes on the scene 
 My rap sound better with crime on the scene 
 Fillmo down comacaze a rap 
 Gotta have a weed sack with my party pack 
 It's like that 
 Shit can heel like row melo 
 Stir it up till the rocks up and turn yellow 
 Heavily fiber it's the god of khan 
 Wishes of my verdigo passes on 
 Knockin' on the ferbigates high off bomb 
 And you can see my life if you read my palm 
 It's like that 
 Ceazor Enrico Vandello... 
 Fransico... And Anreco... (Repeat x2) 
 Check this out don't move 
 I hold you like a slow grove 
 In my mind and my soul ima brake rules 
 Here the new crew 
 It's something like the cioty gang 
 Comin' down on your town like black rain 
 Blunts in cuts an' rapped up in the indeca 
 Rymes are riped and hollow tips when they hittin' ya 
 Man they really ain't a friend of ya 
 So it ain't no popin' my mind when they gettin' ya 
 Turn like a top spittin' colp it gets 
 Tell a record lable die if they hold the check 
 'Cause its right here homie 
 The fead is for cash 
 You get it, then you split it then you hit it an' mash 
 You talk like a squrl 
 I hope you ain't a sqwilla 
 You lookin' at a newer fool rap drug dealla 
 Take fliet 
 Buckle up like a plane ride 
 Why oh why do I remain high 
 Shootin at the sky that's over my head 
 Hoppin that the bulets all wake the dead 
 Lottanufdad the shake they bed 
 But tuwa danuf dad gonna crack the feds 
 Because I fly like a bat outta' hell 
 That's for real 
 Fake like a prisoner sittin' in jail 
 When it comes to these rymes betta' get the scale 
 Or act like your blind fucker read it in bral 
 Nigga crime fail 
 No crime on the ride 
 All in your eyes it's a sign of the times 
 Heaily fiber it's the god of khan 
 Witness of my verdigo passes on 
 Standin at the perly gates high off bomb 
 And you can see my life if you read my palm 
 Ceazor Enrico Vandello... 
 Fransico... And Anreco... (Repeat x3)
