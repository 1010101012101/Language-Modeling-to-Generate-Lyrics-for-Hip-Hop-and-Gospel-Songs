You used to like my style 
 I used to like your smile 
 I said I'll stay a sec 
 You said stay a while 
 We started sippin wine 
 Said I was on your mind 
 I said I'm thinkin' of you to girl 
 You're hella fine 
 We hit the night time 
 For a late date 
 And every day after that 
 For eight months straight 
 Though we was rolled tight 
 We had small fights 
 You should've seen how we argued 
 Under street lights 
 I couldn't see your tears 
 From the pouring rain 
 You should've seen my body shake 
 When she said my name 
 She said I'm not the same 
 Andre you changed 
 I said baby it's pain 
 From the rap game 
 We went our separate ways 
 Man I was hurt for days 
 I didn't even call 
 I went through withdrawl 
 Flashbacks of her face 
 Hit me sometimes 
 And I was wondering man 
 Does she think of mine? 
 I think that Rose stuck through the hardest time 
 Sometimes I'll put Al Geen on and think of Rose 
 Being with you is like a state of mind 
 Girl I'm thinkin' about you all the time 
 Seen her at a club 
 She was with a thug 
 She thought I would say hi 
 But I didn't show no love 
 The homies blazin' buds 
 And now it's gettin' live 
 But I knew that she knew 
 I'd protect my pride 
 I seen her watchful eye 
 From across the joint 
 And she knew how I'd feel 
 If I heard her voice 
 Now some ladies talked 
 And other ladies walked 
 But when it came to you girl 
 Man there was a spark 
 Your whole anatomy man 
 Was like poetry 
 The very smell of your hair 
 Was like a luxury 
 It was because of me 
 When your days were bright 
 I would come through 
 With my silent light
