You not thinking of taking over the cartah? 
 Yeah we taking over the cartah 
 Mothafucka so dangerous 
 Niggas is you ready to rush 
 Niggas is you ready to bust 
 The niggas ain't related to us 
 That mothafucka betta hit the back of the bus 
 The rap god said nigga tina is official 
 Do what you wanna, but never blow the whistle 
 Hot like a rhyme in your mind 
 Get the fucking of your zodiac sign, it gets worse 
 Where's my heart 'cause it's not with church 
 On the ground with my mind doing major work 
 Turn around like a tornado uh cado 
 Never do your family like fredo 
 Niggas spit a rhyme like yayo 
 Get to thinking like a convict sitting in jayul 
 Sitting in jayul, rotting like a muthafucka sittin' in jayul 
 Run muthafucka yeah nigga why bother 
 They ain't god and they ain't thy fatha 
 Five back will mothufucka they oughta 
 Taking over like nino did tha cartah 
 Project moving shit yeah it just got harda 
 Protect thy son and protect thy daughter 
 Money be the reason and it make me wanna holla 
 Taking over like nino did the cartah 
 When it comes to my lawyer, fuck them laws 
 You better get me off, fuck them laws 
 I done this before though, let me fall 
 Cock sucka and you betta show paws. punk bitch. 
 I wrote a rap to get filthy rich 
 Stepping out of my ride with the freshest kicks 
 Betta vision so sick about a bed o scratch 
 And if a fucka try to tell you try to crack his back 
 Nigga weed and fo' g's they made a bad seed 
 Show me the money I show you weed 
 Nothin' but cons and mines all I need 
 The rest of you fuckas you can burn 'n' bleed 
 Nigga roar like a lion, cry like a dove 
 My filmore heart don't show no love 
 So caught up in my luck 
 And muthafucka betta hit the back of the bus 
 Line 'em up just like valentines day 
 They never thought theyd get done that way 
 Just like rugbee that's how I play 
 In this situation just sayn ok 
 Run muthafucka yeah nigga why bother 
 They ain't god and they ain't thy fatha 
 Five back will mothufucka they oughta 
 Taking over like nino did tha cartah 
 Project moving shit yeah it just got harda 
 Protect thy son and protect thy daughter 
 Money be the reason and it make me wanna holla 
 Taking over like nino did the cartah 
 Man I eat alot of candy, 'cause life ain't sweet 
 U get pimped slapped trying to bite this beat 
 Or even knocked out tryin' to fight them streets 
 Blunt toed muthafucka dark in peace 
 Fucka grab your hat, get away from the storm 
 Homie you died on the day you was born 
 So forever, imma chase this chedda 
 Pullin somethin' hot like a polo sweata 
 Full of greed 'n' ambeed that's me 
 I just start to kick it at a quarter to three 
 Look for self 'cause I be where I be 
 In that spot till the cops say freeze 
 Pop yo colla for a scholar gettin' dollars 
 And all you hear is no contest yo honor 
 So caught up in my luck 
 And mothafuckas betta hit the back of the bus 
 Out the court and then I split that blunt 
 Fucka I was nervous I won't even front 
 Don't wait 'cause its on right now 
 How you let a cocksucka bring you down 
 Lookin' at the moon think I spotted a cow 
 Fucka motha fucka ain't bumpin that loud 
 He might be happy but that fucka ain't proud 
 He ain't wit it lets kick him outta the croud 
 Laugh or gag you get treated like trash 
 Fuckin' with muthafuckas walkin' that path 
 Money be the reason and it's all about the dollar 
 Takin' over like nino did the cartah
