One thing I despise is ivirgint suicide 
 Sure Khan is something that the wind cries 
 The way I collect is like a bomb threat 
 Meanin' if you don't have my doe 
 I'm a blow fo sure 
 You better have heat when you hang with this villain 
 Meaning that its cold when I'm chillin' 
 Catch a fillin 
 Slipped in on a banana peelin 
 I seen them dead on the floor with the blood's keated to the ceiling 
 I was like yo how that happen? 
 Chuck taylors down gotta keep on rapin 
 The one bullet, the right place at the right time 
 Can turn a hell of a wave into a flat line 
 My style don't pump no blood 
 It pump weed and gasoline, Nicky Nickitine 
 Man ectasy can twist yo spleen 
 Tell that to the freak in them jeans, know what I mean 
 It's kind of ironic, make a phone call for the chronic 
 And let my tigers hold the gin and tonic 
 Man it hurts so much it blastin me 
 But I do what the rap gods ask of me 
 Have heart, have hustle 
 Have heart if you don't have muscle buy the punk gear in the tuscle 
 No love, unpassionate, blow weed in the face of the badest chick 
 Yet spin like a CD, try not to get sleepy 
 On the grind when it's creepy, street gods wanna teach me 
 Pocahantes makin' money for me bustin' in the tee pee 
 My All Star Chuck Taylors, they laced like the mayor 
 Street ball court player 
 Rapid fire rhyme sayer 
 You be like Nicky man no favor, real poppa 
 I disapear like Jimmy Hopper 
 Reappear on Easter 
 Pants in the heavy start to increase her 
 T-shirts with the vestes feature 
 Miesha check it it's the god of Khan 
 Chuck Taylor down like the Ramidan 
 Catch a feeling, slipped in on a bananna peelin 
 You got a scheme homie what you dealin' 
 Man the bathroom tinted 
 With the blunt wrapped dope in it 
 It's like Popeye with his spinach 
 Run around like you playing tennis 
 And you still ain't finished 
 International keep the party crackin' like its pistachios 
 The freaks got it poppin' like a fashion show 
 Make a move with me birdy baby, grab the doe 
 Like a linebacker 
 I got a gift like a blind jacker 
 Put a hole in your six packer 
 The south paw with the lock jaw 
 In the kitchen with the rock raw 
 You remind me of cocaine and do do stains 
 Man it's the shitty dope dealer 
 Dirty worm catapilla 
 Weed collide like the sun and the moon 
 And I'm still trippin' of that room with the blood on the ceiling 
 Catch a fillin 
 My chuck taylors got me creepin' 
 And rap dealin' 
 Come through and leave you stunned 
 And in shock 
 And leave my heart on your block like a lost glock 
 In the bushes or woods man you did what you could 
 With the little you got are you cold or hot 
 Put it down with the plot, and got knocked 
 And went to jail naked in your shoes and socks 
 Left it up to your woman man to move your rocks 
 And the freak turned the spot into a hot box 
 Chuck Taylors All Stars and all stars 
 Make my way to the bar and there you are 
 Catch a fillin 
 Hey sister give me some of those shoes
