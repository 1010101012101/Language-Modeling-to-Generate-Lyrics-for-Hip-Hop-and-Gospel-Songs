(Andre Nickatina) 
 Man, I'ma run my mouth and get your corporate account 
 Bring my benz out in the middle of a drought 
 I blow lye like its "God Bless Buddha" 
 It's sort of like the feelin' runnin' with a known shooter 
 Baby I'ma spit it to the limit, run into the abyss 
 You know its god number 7 on your top ten list 
 Its kamikaze, look into the eyes of a pisces 
 And Las Vegas talkin' shit is where you might find me 
 Fillmo' down from the nose to the toes 
 Get your cell phone you can picture every pose 
 Picture all the clothes, picture all the hoes 
 Picture the perfection when your money pile grows 
 You gotta crocodile style, I sport gators 
 They still might bite, so fresh with the flavor 
 Got Khan? Fillmore's number one sign 
 Steak, potatoes, garlic bread and some prawns! 
 (Chorus: Messy Marv (Andre Nickatina)) 
 (Yeah) San Francisco baby 
 Fillmo' niggas try'na bring back the 80's, Yeah 
 (Yeah money is the motto 
 And run around town like its Grand Theft Auto, Chicka-kahnn) 
 Wally on my hip, good weed in my mouth 
 Gangsta niggas in the whip, Yeah 
 (Your not dealin' with clowns 
 When you try to kick hop, watch your body shut down) 
 (Messy Marv) 
 Yeah, nigga I'ma mothafuckin' fool 
 Trees for breakfast, eat brunch by noon 
 24 Davins, only showin the lip 
 The rest of the women, same color as the whip 
 Jump out and crack a nigga shit wide open 
 Jump back in the nickel with the barrel still smokin' 
 Fillmore nigga, yeah bitch break bread 
 I don't want no pussy, I don't want no head 
 But you can get a sack of that purple stuff 
 Some gin and a bag of that Hillary Duff 
 I'ma pimp, trapped in a gangsta's body 
 I'm on dope and gonna fuck around and hurt somebody 
 On Tuesday and Thursday the ghost pull up 
 Then everybody runs, they'll fuck you up 
 I'ma shady ass nigga, man I ain't gon' lie 
 I just wanna sell dope, smoke weed and get high, you BITCH 
 (Chorus: Messy Marv (Andre Nickatina)) 
 (Yeah) San Francisco baby 
 Fillmo' niggas try'na bring back the 80's, Yeah 
 (Yeah money is the motto 
 And run around town like its Grand Theft Auto, Chicka-kahnn) 
 Wally on my hip, good weed in my mouth 
 Gangsta niggas in the whip, Yeah 
 (Your not dealin' with clowns 
 When you try to kick hop, watch your body shut down) 
 (Andre Nickatina) 
 You might mistake me for Doug E. Fresh, the way I sport ballies 
 With my Slick Rick talk and my Slick Rick walk 
 I wear rings like the planet called Saturn 
 The money's movin' baby then your body is the pattern 
 You know I hide out like it's witness protection 
 Some people start to stare like a model car collection 
 You know it's like: twenty G's in a Jordan briefcase 
 My hood came up off the word "freebase" 
 Man the soul of a grammy runs through my body structure 
 My bottom ho cries, 'cause I never say I love her 
 It's a cold word, that's why I p-p-p-party 
 My lawyer is a sneaky motherfucker, very naughty 
 With hot lies, I hit Popeye's for hot fries 
 A real rap cat, talkin' till the sun rise 
 What's your astrology, and your biography 
 I talk a little bit to get you to follow me 
 I'm like the quality, you like the quanity 
 Fillmore born and ain't no apology 
 (Messy Marv) 
 San Francisco baby 
 Fillmo' niggas try'na bring back the 80's, Yeah 
 Wally on my hip, good weed in my mouth 
 Gangsta niggas in the whip, Yeah
