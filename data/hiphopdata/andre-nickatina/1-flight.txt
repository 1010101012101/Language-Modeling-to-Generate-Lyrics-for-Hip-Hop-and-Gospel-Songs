I'm always looking for a winna 
 Your rolling with a world wide sinner 
 Jump out the car and let the perm hit her 
 The city is a drug 
 My Rolls Royce is thumping like the club 
 So I ain't gonna front 
 Here have a blunt 
 Sittin' outa here deli square having lunch 
 The Hennesy we drinking got us both getting drunk 
 And then I start talking about my ranes 
 And how moneys made 
 Baby even when it rains, it's not a game. 
 I'm bright like the night next door light 
 If it's the first class fight then it must be right, yo 
 And I don't have to time to be no Sponcer 
 Man and if we do it right then we might have time to hit up all the concerts 
 Might hit the mall way harder then a boxer 
 Do something nice 
 Then he asking me to knock her 
 I could never jock her 
 Gotta put the game on display 
 She bit her lip and didn't walked away 
 My name is Dre! 
 Baby make that flight 
 For real, we could do it all tonight 
 Now give me one chance to make it right 
 Cause' I could get the clients 
 And you can get the science 
 The way I'm talking baby, can make somebody else buy it 
 They really can't deny it 
 The city is the maker for the money 
 Blaze no, dirty talk to me 
 My number is 555-5555 
 It's kind of hard to memorize 
 I'm so live 
 I do a U-Turn all on Vaness 
 Baby thought I wouldn't do it cause' the car is so fresh 
 I jump out the car 
 Own her like a shooting start 
 And even though I wearing Jordan man I still at the par 
 Man it's the city life connect with the pretty life 
 When people treat their car and money like a pretty wife 
 You take her 'round town, maybe take her downtown 
 Anywhere the money's quick and it never slows down
