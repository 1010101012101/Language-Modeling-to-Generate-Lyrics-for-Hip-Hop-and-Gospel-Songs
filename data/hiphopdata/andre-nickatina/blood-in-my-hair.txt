Blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk 
 No angels guide me I seem to be lost 
 Spittin' a rhyme from devious ways 
 All in the veins them freaks they get paid 
 The path was laid the bed was set 
 Nicky the cat from the fillmoe jets 
 Here go the stealo it ain't that odd 
 Kahn, money, clothes, broads 
 Don't forget weed and rap for the gods 
 Pages that rewrite the holy karahn 
 Man I've been swervin since julius erving 
 Ready to rap now so open the curtain 
 Don't be in the lab when I'm doin' bad 
 Pencil's and pads they turn to cash 
 This how I mash 
 Driving so fast 
 Shoes say wu when I step on the gas 
 Baby is mad 
 Man she got ass 
 I looked and gave her my gangsta laugh 
 My pedigree my legacy 
 I sell it like aphetimines 
 They told me at the dinner scene 
 And I'm standing there high in my anchor jean 
 Gangsta's, hustlers, hoe's and all 
 Be one to pay when a rapper falls 
 Blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk 
 No angels guide me I seem to be lost 
 Its mighty extreme to being a king 
 Looking for people to be on the team 
 How much money it cost to cheat 
 To slow ya down and be drug free 
 With ? boots and sean john suits 
 And exacution that top of the roof 
 Who got the juice 
 Show me some proof 
 The curser the rhyme give me the loot 
 Awake like an owl and drinkin' some tea 
 Watchin fights of muhamud ali 
 Dodgin death with every step 
 This is my rep give me the checks 
 Like snaggle puss I'll step to the left 
 With this freak death as quiet as kept 
 My philosophy is tha boss of me 
 Pass the hot sauce to me 
 Usin' diamonds and pearls to flauce with me 
 I stand there with none 
 Hot as a gun 
 The sound of the noise will make you run 
 Move from the slugs that will rip your lungs 
 Look in the eyes of the greediest god 
 Rollin' the streets with the cadi? 
 Cut through the rain like ninja blades 
 The batter ramming slang the rage 
 I got my game from project floors 
 Weed, dope, and dice by the door 
 Crush anything that'll cause a threat 
 Talk to the bookie secure the bet 
 Never with leniency he won't agree with me 
 Gettin' all mad when I make the call 
 Gangsta's, hustlas, hoes, and all 
 Feel the pain when a rapper falls 
 Blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk 
 No angels guide me I seem to be lost
