I'm like some coca-cola 
 Better yet a motorola 
 Man time is gettin' shorter 
 Or should I say like colda 
 Man cats is gettin' bolder 
 From moving banking soda 
 Man bullets dance like clubs on them hot corners 
 I kick it live and wicked 
 Like a winning lotto ticket 
 Man hide your money 
 Hide your dope 
 And hide your ruler biscuit 
 It's like so devastated 
 The way I say so gated 
 So keep your clorox when you see me 'cause I can't be faded 
 Its about that scrilla mail 
 Some suckas bite they nails 
 'Cause they just sold their soul like a crack sale 
 All outta black mail 
 All in them packed jails 
 Until you get there man you think it's like a ghost tale 
 But check it out I see ya 
 But wouldn't wanna be ya 
 'Cause even all in korea 
 They know nickatina 
 Man I could be your neighbor 
 Your favorite icecream flavour 
 Your city county mayor 
 Alaskin polar bear 
 I'm on the roli that hogged the freeway 
 In a majorway 
 Man get at me today YO! SO! 
 I swang like peter parker 
 I walk like johnny walker 
 Some cats they welcome back man 
 Like I was mister carter 
 I dress like darth vader 
 Snap back like alligator 
 8 packs are down later 
 Well call like auto traders 
 Love doin' my motha favors 
 Talk shit with major players 
 Stay away from space invador cock blockin playa haters 
 I stay in good season 
 No matter what the reason 
 And I be screaming at demons until I ain't breathin 
 N yo I ain't leaving 
 Until I get minez 
 So crack a 40 for urself because we got time 
 I keep the speakers bumpin 
 I keep ya ride slumpin 
 Ya future looks bright so freak why you here frontin 
 Japanese they serve me saki 
 It make me feel like cocky 
 Remonis don't need 40 when he raps on carlos rossy 
 I'm not a carbon copy 
 Nothin' ever really shocks me 
 Man I'm a speedy cat 
 Man I'm not big and stocky 
 I lace your mindthought 
 Like I'm your underboss 
 A loanshark that makes bets that can choke the cause 
 I ride it rocky y'all 
 Like kawasaki y'all 
 Flew through these streets 
 Like a snake 
 Until they stopped me y'all
