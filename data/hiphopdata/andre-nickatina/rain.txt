Fast like an automobile- no thrill, 
 Rockin' the game till I get killed... 
 Baby uza freak? Okay. Keep my life in the fast lane 
 Set it right where the thunders at- You know I dress like a lumberjack 
 Mixin it up, like a pot of stew 
 Sometimes I do what my momma do: 
 'Thank the lord- Break the chain, keep your wickedness in vain 
 Respect the name 
 State your claim' 
 'Cause It's gon' be times, when It rains 
 Come and wash away the pain 
 'Cause they dun' taste my tears 
 'Cause I've been cryin' fo years 
 As far as the game goes +No Love+ 
 Bullets fly to rip you up 
 Holy Con'ver adjust your rhyme bookin by the dollar imma be a scholar 
 Clouds start to gather around, Tennasee tears on that clown 
 Focused like a falcon scoutin on the hideout in the mountains 
 'Cause when the bullets start to scream, best believe you both be shoutin 
 Thinkin' they bustin' fo the game 
 Talkin' bout they new cocoain 
 All I'm tryna say mang is come verify urself in the rains 
 Come and wash away the pain 
 'Cause they dun taste my tears 
 'Cause I've been cryin fo years 
 You know I ROLL so cold 
 Just like a bat out the hottest hell 
 Mixin pink bunny when the jewelry sell 
 Do it again when I make bail 
 You know the streets a hard drive 
 Everyday a newer crime 
 Caught up in the wrong design 
 Watch your heart just flatline 
 Shake it like the earthquake does 
 Nothin' but steel inside your blood 
 Colder than a winter storm 
 Some will die and some are born 
 But do it all- u miss, remain 
 Full respect for this here game 
 Forget your unbrella mang 
 And take a ride with me in the rains 
 Come and wash away the pain 
 'Cause they dun taste my tears 
 'Cause I've been cryin fo years 
 Conversation they cutthroat 
 Deaths of sangs on every note 
 Tell the truth on every quote 
 'Cause mothafuckas come up short 
 Actin' like this is Hollywood 
 In the real world and it hardly good 
 Talkin' like ya you don't care 
 End up in a wheelchair 
 Livin' witcho momma while yo friends in the bahamas 
 And sanas 
 And premadonas mang 
 Livin' like the dope game 
 Forever about this whole thang 
 Smokin' on weed in the rains 
 Come and wash away the pain 
 'Cause they dun taste my tears 
 'Cause I've been cryin fo years...
