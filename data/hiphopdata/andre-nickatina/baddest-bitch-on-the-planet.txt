Could you be the baddest bitch up in the world? 
 Money ain't a thing whip cream with a swirl 
 Baby you could ball or bounce 
 Lip gloss, floss up your mouth 
 Can I get the keys to your house? 
 Your skin color keep 'em in a daze 
 It's somethin' like a maze 
 All bad bitches get paid 
 Baby you can put me in your grand design 
 By lookin' in my eyes for the dollar signs 
 Because your face so bright like Las Vegas nights 
 Fill 'moe down rap cat in yo life 
 Man other bitches hate all the time 
 Bitches tell lies 
 Feet hurt 'cause they wear the wrong shoe size 
 But yours is a body like a cruise 
 How could you lose? 
 Go and get the money from the foo's 
 Man everything back there is jelly 
 Made for those five star tellys 
 Cats can't wait to spend bread 
 Bitch go ahead 
 Do it like Simon Says 
 If it don't hurt it ain't done 
 Arch your back out 
 I'll pull a stack out that'll blow your back out 
 I like when your hair run wild in the wind 
 You and your girlfriend act like twins 
 But could you be the baddest bitches on the planet? 
 You got it goin' on to where you man can't stand it 
 Well I'm not him 
 Leave that cat 
 Tell him you a ho and you like it like that 
 You think I don't like ya 
 You got it all wrong 
 I get goose bumps when I see that you call 
 You know that I'll ball like Barkley Charles 
 People like to stare when you walk through the halls 
 Put some steel in your heels 
 Chase the dollar bills and give it to a playa that's real 
 Because ya at least once a week she like to kiss another freak 
 Fine ass bitches sometimes don't speak 
 But bitch don't run from the ism 
 The ism ain't a track star leanin in a fat car 
 Bitches know I charge 
 I'm not a matador so you know I don't bull 
 Real bitches like to stay paid in full 
 Man, I don't do favors 
 This ain't no caper 
 Get my paper 
 Leather black calf high boots 
 Stuffed with loot 
 Attract those men in the business suits 
 You know I'm gonna lace you with game 
 Andre Nicky is the name 
 Dope bitch 
 Could you be the baddest bitch that exist? 
 Always top five in every cats list 
 It's never hit or miss you my bitch 
 Even Santa Claus gotta spend chips 
 It's a cold winter 
 I'm cold when I go get her 
 She wear t-shirt and panties that don't fit her 
 And I'm gonna get at least a rack you best believe that 
 I holla bout scratch like a real rap cat 
 I get it off top man like it or not 
 I let my perm blow in my homie's drop top 
 She latch like a garter belt make a trick heart melt 
 First rate, high rate 
 And he's heart felt 
 You's a bad bitch you know I gotta say this 
 You'd be somethin' that I wanna run away with 
 But until then tell your boyfriend 
 It's quick 'cause I'm a bitch 
 I'm not your girlfriend
