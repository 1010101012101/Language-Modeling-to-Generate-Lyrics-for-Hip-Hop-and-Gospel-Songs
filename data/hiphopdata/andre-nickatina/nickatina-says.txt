Nickatina says cast ya votes 
 Tell all the freaks, yeah grab ya coats 
 Tell all the nerds, yeah take some notes 
 And R&B niggas, y'all clear your throats, uh 
 Nickatinas been at since 11 
 Got me a house up in gang bang heaven 
 My mother used to say that I was like a little reverend 
 That's why they call me God # 7 
 I like birds 'cause I'm a hawk 
 Try to clown me hoe and I'ma walk 
 Rockin' ya party is my favorite part 
 Did it for an hour and I didn't even talk, bitch 
 Nickatinas is like Simon says 
 Dips in his whip like Simon says 
 Make a few chips like Simon says 
 Smoke a little weed in the back with the dreads, yo 
 I take pride in smellin' fly 
 Baby ain't no tellin' why I blaze 
 I sport Chuck Taylor's twice a week 
 Gotta keep an ear out on the streets 
 Man I'm kinda high, you said who got beef 
 Do niggas take advice from these nasty freaks, yeah 
 Did you see the cold steel 
 Homie that shit'll make you cold for real 
 Even though it's hot when it's 'bout to hit 
 Hot enough to make a bastard do a flip 
 What you know about ghetto cheese 
 All she heard on the phone was, "nigga, please" click 
 I'm like an ice cream truck 
 Veins get cold when I cut this blunt 
 Nothin' but fire tiga in my path 
 And nah, man you can't have no autograph 
 Nickatina says bust back first 
 And by any means necessary don't get hurt 
 The five millimeter go good with the nina 
 Just like raps go good with Nickatina 
 Nickatina says lace ya boots 
 Real drug style Armani suits 
 Check this out baby, I'm tell the truth 
 You's a freak and you ain't that cute, hoe 
 I kick back like expensive wine 
 Spit paragraphs all through the test of time 
 It's just like ya found a treasure chest with mines 
 Just like ya found a treasure chest with mines, nigga 
 Andre is like the moon 
 Come out after six tiga ready to boom, move 
 It ain't no thang to me 
 Easy as pie, can you hang with me, fast 
 I mix it up like Ron Barcardi 
 Talk and walk and smoke weed at the party 
 Gamble on yourself for about two g's 
 I'm eatin' water melon way juicy, fuck it 
 Check it out I get blunted on top 
 Livin' like an anvil ready to drop, playa
