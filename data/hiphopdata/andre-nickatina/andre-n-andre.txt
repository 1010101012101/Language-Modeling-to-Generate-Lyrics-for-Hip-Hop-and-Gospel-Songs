Mac Dre-- 
 Backwoods got me congested, ain't rested in 2 days 
 I'm gettin' paid been on niggas head like toupes 
 I'm a thug 'cause wipe the blood out yo gaze 
 Cutthoat nigga bitch I scam on 'em fo days 
 In school days I blew baze got ripped and fucked up 
 In new jays on 2 ways I scritched and scratched up 
 I beat that bitch up when I found out she lyin' 
 Who she think I am? Saving Private Ryan? 
 Andre Nickatina-- 
 I make the town move just by walkin' on your block 
 Take the keys to yo city but I still picked the locks 
 Buy a car and a glock put the cash in my socks 
 Put the beat in the trunk so ya hear the shit knock 
 To hell with the law the freeways mines 
 So is yo freak, radios, and alpines 
 Coke wit a little bit of cherry lemon lime 
 Ya think of me ya think of big money every time 
 Kennel Cole shine like the trigger of a nine 
 Orca was a whale but pisces is the sign 
 Mac Dre-- 
 I got split personalities I'm bipolar 
 Ya might see me wit my Italion stallion or my chola 
 Rap rock 'n' rolla I'm dope as yola 
 If you don't pimp her, I might like? 
 I'm ridin' in a big boat like Noah 
 Wit 2 women of each races boy I control her 
 A ho a ho stable I'm a Mac and a medic 
 No do ho debt it, that's right I said it 
 Andre Nickatina-- 
 I treat my dolla bills like my Caddy steering wheel 
 I'm not a chill pill freak do what ya will 
 Heart ticking like a timebomb eatin spicy prawns 
 Man it's the God of Khan check it baby right or wrong 
 Man look but don't stare it's the crime rhyme king 
 Wit braids like a juvenile ca na mean? 
 Bruce springsteen in my anchor blue jeans 
 O yeah I'm in yo city man what's up wit the weed? 
 Man call all the g's and tell 'em all freeze 
 Andre Nickatina sayin' nigga what ya need? 
 Hit the corner so narrow in a fly blue camaro 
 A sparrow dodging arrow but not a double barrel 
 Mac Dre-- 
 We in a 7 series beema it's me and nickatina 
 Ready to sexually harass a bitch like Martin did Geena 
 Committin felonies and hella misdemeanors 
 A dog in the yard where the grass is hella greener 
 Rap singer pimp that'll slap Tina 
 I mack Nina from black to latina 
 Clean as noxzema quick to pop the nina 
 Got the money from the broad as soon as I seen her 
 Will I meet a Tina and Trina? got dick by the bay on the berkeley marina 
 Don't mean to the point the finger but uh (but uh) 
 She got pancake syrup but uh (but uh) 
 Andre Nickatina-- 
 Man the way I smoke weed is like death of a genius 
 Reappear roll up rise like a phoenix 
 This is not a remix nino felix 
 Put it in a capsule seal it deal it 
 How you want it nicky baby? 4 times 5 
 A quarter ounce of weed and some cherry pot pies 
 Excuse me if I'm greedy 'cause I'm caught up in the lust 
 Ill lie if ya want but I'm a tiga you can crust 
 'Cause I'm on Fillmoe in a white velour suit 
 In a blue kangol in my wu-tang boots 
 Wit a back like a cobra cursed by the mail 
 My manicured nails touch a triple beam scale 
 Baby is a athlete body like a star 
 Ya talkin' real bad freak meet me by the car
