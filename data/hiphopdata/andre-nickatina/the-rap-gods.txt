I'm still standin... 
 This for the rap gods... 
 (Andre) 
 I tried to earn wings but, I think I grew horns 
 And maybe that's why MC's rock me like porn 
 Flowin like the water in the Mississippi river 
 I suppose it grows in the hennessey sipper, thank me 
 To do a show, and we tryin' to do a palace, like a midnight jet, 
 My soul roams off to dallas, 
 Its somethin' like cream when we hustle on the scene 
 Other MC's and freaks wanna join the team 
 Dealers would fly, ride the engines of pimps 
 The colors were candy coated, incredible rims 
 And my dreams of what people sayin', don't get a job 
 I realize now it was all the rap gods 
 I slither through the streets like a boa constricter 
 On my car dashboard got the gangsta pictures 
 Sportin leather and energy, could that be me? 
 Smokin' weed listenin to run DMC? 
 My repute was a rap child, emotions of steel 
 Represent with no crew man, your life is sealed 
 Add a two's of all kinds, with gun zippers in em' 
 See notes don't last long, we can't wait to spin em' 
 Oh cars, and bars, weed, greed, and clothes 
 Maintain my women, clown the rest of these hoes 
 Man, my festive up braid the truth of a rhyme 
 After restin on jeopardy to my lifetime grind 
 I'm like an angel that's high smoken' weed up in heaven 
 We're as crooked as reverends, b-ball playground legends 
 Triangle, some say sinsanati bang goes, stars fangle 
 Hand cold as chris krango, we break hearts 
 And crack rib praps, take trips far 
 Shop at the gap, ten by the rap gods 
 Shoot the git, so I blessed it with some weed, bacon, eggs and grits 
 I can block the sun, like a solar-eclipse 
 My homie said he had a yaght but I don't mess with ships 
 The freak, said she hated dope dealers, they clock they ends, 
 I said which is why ur payin' this rapper then 
 Nickatina, I'm something like simbad the sailor 
 Dress in red and black, the true signs of a raider
