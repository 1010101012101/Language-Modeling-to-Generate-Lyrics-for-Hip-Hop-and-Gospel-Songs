Daquiri factory where niggas look after me 
 Assault and battery 
 Its sort of a tragedy 
 Kickin it live right with killas suspended 
 Smokin' weed in the kitchen they're so reluctant they'll listen 
 It's the daquiri factory where niggas look after me 
 Assault and battery 
 Its sort of a tragedy 
 Kickin it live right with killas suspended 
 Smokin' weed in the kitchen they're so reluctant they'll listen 
 Can you picture the perfect rhyme, the perfect tone, the perfect pitch, 
 The perfect mind, the perfect crime, the perfect bitch, 
 Ur so materialistic you make me wanna risk it 
 Hopin the pig don't pull me over wit my new biscuit 
 I'm sorta twisted swervin to the next lie 
 I bet ill beef and tangarae in my next life 
 Or a silverdad makin' you picture that with all my cuzins 
 Its bullets made for the payback its sorta slippery 
 Kinda like this treat is wet 
 But I'm a vet so let ur tiger break a leg 
 With all the pain fed up with the dope game 
 That's y I still love all my tigers the same 
 It's the daquiri factory where niggas look after me 
 Assault and battery

 Baby sed you look sad cheer up uh wuts ur name 
 I sed its andre uh I can't complain I love segas and ghetto basketball playas 
 And I spit rap to all the legendary crack slangers 
 We kick it live buzzing like a beehive 
 And it'll remain that way till we hit the sky 
 Like public enemy numba 1 cats come 2 my show 
 And say that oozy way a ton son you know the chemistry 
 Do you remember me and I'm ur tiger from way back in 83 
 We ate ice cream and played hoop man we did all these things before the dday 
 It's the daquiri factory where niggas look after me 
 Assault and battery 
 Its sort of a tragedy 
 Kickin it live right with killas suspended 
 Smokin' weed in the kitchen they're so reluctant they'll listen

 Bye bye
