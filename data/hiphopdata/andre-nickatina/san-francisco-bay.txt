I bathed in the water of the wrath 
 I like to count the money 
 Bitch I like to do the math 
 You're sneaky like a left jab 
 Over hand right 
 I'm Friday night fights in the Memphis bright lights 
 I got a suit passion 
 I like to dress in the high fashion 
 Broke hos with good jokes keep me laughin' 
 I talk shit behind the tint of my Benz 
 As my driver goes 90 over da Bay Bridge 
 It's like smokin' weed all up in heaven 
 My God is a 7 
 And yo I'm a 3 11 
 That's 14 
 I sport Jordan's when I wear jeans 
 I'm in the hills of Tahoe throwing on my high beams 
 I like to wear rings 
 A couple pretty things 
 I sport leather on a bitch 
 If the city rains 
 We do drugs on a polar bear rug 
 If your man is a pimp 
 Don't expect no love 
 It's all upgrade 
 My new shades block the sun rays 
 Tupac on every Sunday 
 It's all upgrade 
 My new shades block the sun rays 
 Tupac on every Sunday 
 I unwrap the plastic off the swisher 
 Grab your telephone bitch 
 You can take a picture 
 Pour it like it's liquor 
 But move a little quicka 
 We live by the gun 
 So we die by the trigger 
 That's word of life 
 Man have you ever seen a fiend's pipe? 
 It's dark as 12 a.m. 
 Even in the sun light 
 I lose my train of thought until you say the cost 
 I gotta bookie that love when I take a loss 
 I gotta prohibition mind state 
 About the crime rate 
 No love bitch on a blind date 
 You get a repo reaction from the people 
 Down here we bump C-Bo 
 We sport Filas 
 And Adidas 
 And Perry Ellis 
 Them bitches maybe fine but them hos be getting jealous 
 It's high fashion 
 Car crashin 
 Suit matchin' 
 Talkin' shit on the freeway laughin' 
 I gotta sweet tooth 
 I like candy paint 
 I talk shit to a bitch 
 Tell the ho "think"? 
 I gotta sweet tooth 
 I like candy paint 
 I talk shit to a bitch 
 Tell the ho "think"? 
 Get the New Testament 
 You get the tour and the estimate 
 Rhyme crime up in your residence 
 The camera lens is not a friend 
 It just offends 
 So I talk alotta shit behind the tint of my Benz 
 On I-80 880 980 580 
 280 Aw Baby 
 All aboard like a train 
 My young homie said he's like an old man 
 'Cause he's gotta push cane 
 Like a dime 
 To design 
 It never rhyme 
 My soul it never dies just like the Holy Qur'an 
 And on the scale 
 It's like bail 
 And killer whales 
 Get at me early baby 
 Something like a clearance sale 
 I open up 
 I let you know 
 About the cost 
 I eat a pork chop with a deep money thought 
 I open up 
 I let you know 
 About the cost 
 I eat a pork chop with a deep money thought 
 Like a dead poet 
 And you know 
 'Cause you show it 
 I'm driving down to San Jose and ya I like to floor it? 
 Like a dead poet 
 And you know 
 'Cause you show it 
 I'm driving down to San Jose and?
