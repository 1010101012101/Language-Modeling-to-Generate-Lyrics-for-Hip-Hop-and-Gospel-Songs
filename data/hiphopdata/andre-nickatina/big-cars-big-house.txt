I like big cars and a big house a bad bitch with a big mouth 
 Bitch whatcha money talkin' 'bout 
 Gimme five minutes and I'll turn you out 
 I like big cars and a big house, a bad bitch with a big mouth 
 Bitch whatcha money talkin' 'bout 
 Gimme five minutes and I'll turn you out 
 You's a bad ass yellow bitch that like to talk like hella shit 
 Bitch whatcha money workin' with cause everything else is irrelevant 
 I put that on the rhyme, the line, the crime and everything I do in time 
 Mutha fucka get outta line 
 Everybody gonna shine if you work that ass you fine 
 You can make my money stack 
 Do it back-to-back 
 Tell your girlfriend it ain't an act 
 If she really wanna go in the back 
 It's like the Olympics man she can hit the track 
 On the prowl just like a cat lookin' for the scratch 
 I think that you get the catch 
 This ain't no (?) match 
 Till the sun come up that bitch ought to bring it back 
 I like big cars and a big house a bad bitch with a big mouth 
 Bitch whatcha money talkin' 'bout 
 Gimme five minutes and I'll turn you out 
 I like big cars and a big house, a bad bitch with a big mouth 
 Bitch whatcha money talkin' 'bout 
 Gimme five minutes and I'll turn you out 
 You's a supa dupa brown bitch 
 You top heavy and round thick 
 I have to crank the bass in my Crown Vic 
 Then drop you off so you can strip 
 Man the money it rains, it pours 
 Open up the doors 
 You get V.I.P galore 
 When it comes to my pimpin' I'll tell you more 
 You eat all up like a candy store 
 Hershey bars and Kit Kats 
 So that's why I love when you bring it back 
 And you's an Almond Joy eatin' all the boys 
 Showin' other freaks, ya, how to work a toy 
 And, man, just like a chocolate cake when you start to bake 
 Man I think about the money you make 
 And the look up on your face 
 When you see me in the building and I come in and blast the place 
 Walked up like (?) 
 I walk around like the president and I don't leave no evidence 
 Cause at the end of this night bitch I'm a (?) 
 And she smiled like the Cheshire cat lookin' like China statue 
 Man it was super stacked 
 Man she worked the tricks for super scratch 
 And she talked them outta super rack 
 I like big cars and a big house a bad bitch with a big mouth 
 Bitch whatcha money talkin' 'bout 
 Gimme five minutes and I'll turn you out 
 I like big cars and a big house, a bad bitch with a big mouth 
 Bitch whatcha money talkin' 'bout 
 Gimme five minutes and I'll turn you out 
 You's a money makin' red bone that brang all your bread home 
 Five foot nine and dead on 
 Them heels put you in a six zone 
 Packin' all kinds of bakery 
 This is a bitch that's meant for me 
 Shake what your mama gave to me 
 Bitch 'member when you said you wouldn't pay me? 
 Now everything you got I got 
 Believe me bitch you make a lot 
 Ballin' getting me precious rocks 
 Every Parlor at the shop 
 Getcha hair done and I'm sprung 
 You get more money at the club 
 Perm it hard, and curl it up 
 Shake it down and shake it up
