Yeah, you hear me spit... never on time, we always late 
 False dreams, and every thing's on a triple beam 
 It's like a holiday scheme with these 
 Car out lean 
 Money infatuated, killer intimidated, illegally motivated 
 Criminals, death bangs on the block 
 Baby, can I have your keys I hate to pick your lock 
 Snappin like a gator never waitin like a waiter 
 Cherry is my flavor, when it comes to now and laters 
 When it comes to gettin' greedy, man I get green eyes 
 Man I getta get it like muslim sling pies 
 Cuttin' in line, just to get mine 
 Tell ya I feel that, now waitin is a crime 
 Arrest me, cuff me, bail me 
 Rap is money baby, it never failed me 
 I'm like an antique as if in the streets 
 Lickin' my tongue at little kids 
 The lucky motivater when it comes to makin' paper 
 Man you can keep your money, but I really need a fader 
 Hot like potatoes, hair in the jaders 
 Wavvves that make you sick like a sailor 
 Don't ask about the woman, 'cause I'm married to the rap 
 Don't have to say I love you when we love it like that 
 And I'm chillin' like the number one chilla 
 Around some cats that shoot more things than reggie miller 
 Nicky you a real rap dealer, I drank my drank hit the dank, give a pound and say my nigga 
 The situation make me quiver 
 The hotter the cap but the rap coast deal make a nigga shiver 
 And like pizza I deliver 
 Cop your rock, hit the block the mother fucker don't short stop 
 Do you know when you goin' black, it's like a rememerance of a diana ross track 
 You know I gotta foss that 
 Boss that 
 Cross that 
 See in the eye of the devil 
 Loss that 
 Yeah, it gets hot in the room 
 Like the wicked witch, I gotta jump the broom, screamin fuck you by the light of the moon 
 Custom fit like a brand new bra 
 I hate to break the rules but I love to break the law 
 Get caught 
 Gotta lie like a veteran, in the bathtub screamin Fly Pelicans!
