Man, a new Rolls Royce hit the Popeyes drive-through 
 I had to tell my driver I'll guide you 
 See my life through a BlackBerry 
 Some people like that 
 But I think its kinda scary 
 I'm somethin' like a sailboat baby jus tryna sail away 
 And you can tell I'm never comin' back after today 
 I bundle up for the night air 
 Even though its cold and dark yo I still wear white Nike Airs 
 I cop like 4 pairs 
 It reminds me of Michigan and Antwan Jobear 
 I hit the night like I'm el presidentay 
 Don't wanna be up in the kizer perementay yo 
 And I rush outta town like Picasso I rap pain 
 A perfect picture yo 
 Then I come right back 
 Then I embrace my criminal mind, a criminal kind 
 Heres your chance if you see a criminal shine 
 'Cause my style is real 'Pac yo with the Pun set 
 A lotta Tuxedos before I gotta jet 
 I like breakfast in the nighttime 
 MGA made a clock man its fight time 
 Man this the life of a blind genius 
 And even though I can see let me tell you what I mean is 
 I'm so blind by material things 
 Yeah sometimes I don't see what's in front of me mane 
 Yeah ya heard right 
 I hit the night life 
 And shake the whole scene up like a pair of dice 
 I tell the bartender that's too much ice 
 And she overchargin on the hennessy price 
 I don't freestyle 
 I don't free lance 
 I said paced out 
 I say pay fast 
 I know homies that passed in the weight class 
 But it was pushin weight that they all passed at 
 And when I gamble don't catch me on a bad day 
 Like when the warriors had just lost the other day 
 You send me to a preacher 
 I confess 
 You said it's all good 
 I said lets bet 
 I think of Khan at the crack of dawn 
 And then I hit my closet for a new sean John 
 I'm in the middle of a premier pack 
 I put vocals in the burgandy 'lac 
 Yo my perm is like jet black 
 Man it's the life of a blind soul 
 It's like a hustla tryna sell you fake gold 
 Or like a married man who ain't never faithful 
 Or talk down on a ?? when he break hos 
 I hit my court date smellin like straight weed 
 Plus I had a fat knot in my blue jeans 
 You might have to pray for me when I hit Vegas because my mind is wrapped up in the latest and the greatest 
 My afrodesiach is the payest 
 Never ???? 
 And everyone that know me homie know I gotta shopping fetish 
 If you think I'm buyin you somethin' you best forget it 
 Backwards like benjamin button 
 Or superbad somethin' like McLovin 
 Hotter than the oven 
 Baby that boils the crack 
 And When it comes to rap 
 I'm like a spoiled brat 
 And you can catch me some days, hair oiled back 
 And countin' on somethin' that's a royal stack 
 At the tuxedo party in royal black 
 They had barbeque I said foil that
