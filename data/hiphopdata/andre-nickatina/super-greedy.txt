Give me give me g's g's g's 
 -Jackpot 
 From the small bags of weed to them rubber band bundles 
 I remain supper gready this that day and night hustle 
 Snatchin knots from sprung bitches but I'm quick to explain 
 If I ain't all up in your pocket I ain't doin' my thang 
 I'm supper greedy like I'm posed to be 
 Floor wayz be close to me 
 I mite stick you up if you ain't really where your posed to be 
 I'm solid wit my folks but supper scandalous for a click 
 When your sharper make it happen you could bubble off my nip 
 Hyperations stack somethin' losin nothing can you dig it 
 And bet your own hustle man and double small digits 
 Stayin paid is the slogan sippin yak steady smokin' 
 Breakin hammer towns open gotta leave my bag open 
 Microscopin all night nigga even y'all knots 
 Holdin' heat when its hot shit even when it's not 
 'Cause California niggas strive try to come up quick 
 And if you can't hold your own well take your shit 
 California hustlas chase paper all day 
 California smokers blow blunts all day 
 California cats sip yak that way 
 And California cat we react that way 
 -Pat Rich

 Poppin' pussys like pills on the real lettin them know the deal 
 These bitches be worthless

 Flip new bitches like zomes

 California hustlas chase paper all day 
 California smokers blow blunts all day 
 California cats sip yak that way 
 And California cat we react that way 
 -Smoov-E

 Deep when I creep like the red October 
 Without a pocket full of money 
 Your boy get lonely

 Hundred dolla bills in my pocket while your sleepin' on da bench
