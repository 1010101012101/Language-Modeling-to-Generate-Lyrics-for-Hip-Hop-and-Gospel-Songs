Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey... 
 The Soulsonic Force, Mr. Biggs, Pow Wow and MC Globe 
 Shakin' your soul and it's sort of mad 
 When the music is frantic and the spirit is happenin' 
 State of mind, it's a reminisce 
 In a musical sense if you get right to it 
 It's timely situation with your own creation 
 Should be electric, 'cause it's frantic 
 Isn't it a wonder 
 We are the gun and thunder 
 We're on the same mission 
 Come on everybody listen 
 People all across the nation 
 Who thinks they have imagination 
 Everyone wants to see you groove 
 And cause your frantic body to move 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation 
 Zing, zang, zing, zang... 
 So come on everybody, everybody come on 
 Let's all get together and rock along 
 Twist and scream and shout, shout 
 Twist and scream and shout 
 Now do what you came here to 
 In order to get ready you gotta get loose 
 Say, say what? Everybody say, say! 
 Say what? It's a frantic, 
 It's a frantic situation, situation 
 Worlwide, worldwide it's a musical drive 
 Ain't masturbation it's a proclamation 
 All across the nation it's a happy situation 
 Now say, zing, zang, zing, zang... 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation 
 It's a frantic situation
