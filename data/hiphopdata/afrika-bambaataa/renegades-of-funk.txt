No matter how hard you try, 
 You can't stop this now 
 No matter how hard you try, 
 You can't stop this now 
 Renegades of this atomic age 
 This atomic age for renegades 
 Renegades of this atomic age 
 This atomic age for renegades 
 Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece 
 On down through the Middle Ages 
 When the earth kept going through changes 
 There's a business going on, 
 Cars continue to change 
 Nothing stays the same, 
 There were always renegades 
 Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Payne 
 Like Martin Luther King, Malcolm X 
 They were renegades of the atomic age 
 So many renegades hand clap, 
 Hand clap, the renegades 
 From a different solar system 
 Many, many galaxies away 
 We are the force of another creation 
 A new musical revelation 
 And we're on this musical message 
 To help the others listen 
 Improve momentum and seek 
 The electonic chance 
 Like astrology 
 Like technology 
 Like God's Creation 
 Like the Zulu station 
 Like to the nation 
 Like destroy all nations 
 Like militants 
 Like down in sand 
 Like through changes 
 Nothing stays the same 
 Oh, renegades 
 Now renegades are people 
 With their own philosophy 
 They change the course of history 
 Everyday people like you and me 
 You know they have their secret notions 
 And time is endless motion 
 All people of the moderate ages 
 Here in this twentieth century 
 You have to keep up in time 
 With the moderate time 
 A state of mind and a sense of pride 
 A renegade, yes a renegade 
 Of this time and age 
 So many renegades who's that 
 Now hand clap the renegades 
 We're the renegades of funk 
 We're the renegades of funk 
 We're the renegades of funk 
 We're the renegades of funk 
 Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop 
 Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
 You know we're poppin', sockin', with a side of hip-hop 
 Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
 Poppin', sockin', rockin' with a side of hip-hop 
 Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin' 
 We're teachers of the funk 
 And not of empty popping 
 We're blessed with the Force 
 And the sight of electronics 
 With the bass, and the treble 
 The horns and our vocals 
 You know every time we pop 
 Into the beat we get fresh 
 There was a time when our music 
 Was something called the Bay Street beat 
 People would gather from all around 
 To get down on the Bay sound 
 You had to be a renegade those days 
 To take a man on the dance floor 
 Like Afrika Bambattaa and the Soulsonic Force 
 We're talking about Mr. B, Pow Wow, G-L-O-B-E 
 Was a renegade, yes, a renegade of the atomic age 
 So many renegades what's that 
 It's a hand clap the renegade 
 Just jam sucker 
 Say jam sucker 
 Say groove, sucker 
 Say groove, sucker 
 Say dance, sucker 
 Say dance, sucker 
 Now move, sucker 
 Now move, sucker 
 Everybody say 
 We're the renegades of funk 
 We're the renegades of funk 
 We're the renegades of funk 
 We're the renegades of funk 
 We're the renegades of funk 
 We're the renegades of funk 
 We're the renegades of funk 
 We're the renegades of funk 
 Shake that thing 
 That makes me swing 
 I got some great 
 He's a renegade of funk
