(Violent J) 
 There it is y'all, 
 Take a look at that palace, hey, fountains of alizay 
 It be amazing, devastating, 
 Out of control, wizard logo, on a gold flag pole 
 Letâ€™s roll, front door, ring the bells we here, 
 Free beer, weed air 
 Iâ€™m so glad to be there, 
 We could tell they be smoking on something sonic 
 I smelled it in the hallways, Iâ€™m always on it, 
 Asked the guard what that shit is... 
 (Anybody Killa) 
 'Itâ€™s his herb the Wizard' 
 (Violent J) 
 What he donâ€™t share like a big nerd? 
 He was like... 
 (Anybody Killa) 
 'Fools get they gizzards chopped 
 When asking around about the Wizardâ€™s crop' 
 (Violent J) 
 Then I thought, what you thinking? 
 Was that ABK? 
 (Anybody Killa) 
 'Just stick to the hallway, ok, go away' 
 (Violent J) 
 At the Wizardâ€™s gates we all knocked 
 And we walked all in 
 Let the party begin, balling 
 (The Wizard) 
 Who dare come here to meet the big W? 
 You're crazy, your boys are in trouble too 
 I be the one like Big Daddy Wizard Kingpin 
 Tell me what the... 
 Fuck you thinking? 
 I blink and I set your, faces on fire 
 Damnit, must be a faulty wire 
 Well fuck, my voice thing run out again 
 But you're still in terrible danger my friend 
 (Violent J) 
 Tin Man ran and dismanned the curtain 
 It was just some fool in a Fuck Off shirt 
 And it was salt in the game, we maintained the same 
 (The Wizard) 
 Hi, Shaggy, Stretch Nuts be the real name, 
 Or the Wizard if you want 
 But itâ€™s all a front 
 I been here 9 years, 8 days, and a month 
 So I started this hussle, now itâ€™s getting me paid 
 I got to admit I get laid with my own parade 
 But a player like me knows what you want 
 A player like me holds the magic blunt 
 The magic blunt? 
 (The Wizard) 
 The magic blunt 
 I been saving it up, what, what 
 All for a you fools are getting what you want 
 Cause a player like me holds the magic blunt 
 The magic blunt? 
 (The Wizard) 
 The magic blunt 
 Iâ€™m lighting it up, now what, what 
 Mr. Lion 'Yeah', 
 You indeed of a hoe then blow, 'What up dawg?' 
 She's yours, or any other bitch you step to, 
 Donâ€™t let no rep go and intercept you 
 Tin Man, itâ€™s your turn to hit the ganj 
 'Nothing I donâ€™t understand' 
 Your wish is for iron when you made out of steel 
 But you already the hardest for real 
 'Thanks' 
 Scarecrow, my man, hit the dro 
 'Some homies 2 smoke with me?' 
 I know 
 'Iâ€™m puffing but I ainâ€™t seeing nothing' 
 What about the homies thatâ€™s with ya, 
 You saying they frontin? 
 'But I love Tin Tizzy, The Lion, and J though' 
 And they down with you for life, too 
 'Oh' 
 And Violent J 
 'Hey' 
 Now itâ€™s your turn to burn 
 Just hit that shit and the page we turn 
 Just hit that shit and the page we turn 
 Just hit that shit and the page we turn 
 Just hit that shit and the page we turn 
 Just hit that shit and the page we turn 
 (Talking and Coughing) 
 (Violent J) 
 And that was it 
 Next thing I knew I woke up in my very own bed 
 Chillin' 
 And that's, that's how it exactly how it went down 
 Hope you liked it
