 Me and my scarecrow homie headed down the trail 
 A wicked clown impaled, somebody bound to fail 
 They tried to hoe us, and throw us a curve, man I don't know 
 It's more curves in this road then up on Anna Nicole's fat ass 
 Walking down the road we played kick the can, and we thuggin' 
 Juggalug bugging on bammer weed, god damnit 
 Strange planet, can't stand it 
 Trying to find the wizard in this candy land 
 It's lunatic stomping in my air force 1's 
 But they scuffed on, hit up on a blunt and green bud, 
 (Monoxide Child) 
 Atleast you got something on 'em, try using hay 
 I'm losing my shit I'm getting shorter along the way 
 (Violent J) 
 Shit, put on one of mine, you can hop that ass 
 (Jamie Madrox) 
 Nobody fucking move I want your money and cash 
 Don't even fucking turn around, don't look back smiling 
 (Violent J) 
 Damnit even in Oz they thug whiling... 
 (Jamie Madrox) 
 You ain't safe ain't no one safe 
 You've fallen victim to thug whiling 
 Even in your sleep and in your nightmares 
 You ain't safe ain't no one safe 
 You've fallen victim to thug whiling 
 Killaz on the creep is what your life is 
 (Jamie Madrox) 
 I'm made Outta metal and aluminum foil 
 They call me Tin Tizzy; I drink 40's of motor oil 
 Which one of y'all holding, "me", you got weed? 
 And all the folks around here smoke stems and seeds 
 And I need a little bit of that shit you got 
 Keep looking forward, or one of y'all are getting shot 
 This is my part of the brick road, I painted chrome 
 If ya step in my zone, then ya shit is getting stole, you sang... 
 (Violent J) 
 We ain't safe ain't no one safe 
 We've fallen victim to thug whiling 
 Even in our sleep and in our nightmares 
 We ain't safe ain't no one safe 
 We've fallen victim to thug whiling 
 Killaz on the creep is what our life is 
 (Violent J & Monoxide Child) 
 Yo Scarecrow, "What up dawg?", This is bullshit 
 I ain't even seen his ass, he better pull quick 
 'Cause I ain't got shit out here as it is 
 "So leave us the fuck alone, and go rob the Wiz" 
 Yeah he gots a Mercedes, Stretch Hummer, Navi bus 
 All we got is this Bammer and you fucking wit us 
 I turned around, what the fuck you ain't even got a gun 
 (Jamie Madrox) 
 I know you think maybe the Wizard got one? 
 (Violent J & Monoxide Child) 
 Man, I can't even believe this shit crow 
 A tin man at that wit no strap! "I Know" 
 What you know about heavy metal fool or big guns? 
 (Jamie Madrox) 
 I was just warming up fool and I'm ready to get one 
 Take me with you to the wizard of oz, so I can get mine too 
 I'm trying to ride wit y'all 
 (Violent J & Monoxide Child) 
 What you think Scarecrow? 
 "We got the same paint on so that's cool!" 
 But we all should remember the rule... 
 (Violent J) 
 We ain't safe ain't no one safe 
 We've fallen victim to thug whiling 
 Even in our sleep and in our nightmares 
 We ain't safe ain't no one safe 
 We've fallen victim to thug whiling 
 Killaz on the creep is what our life is
