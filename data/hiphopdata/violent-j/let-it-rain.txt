Looks like rain... 
 Sittin' down in my crack house 
 Earning my pay 
 It's the southwest juggla claiming Delray 
 Violent j, known by gang squad and police alike 
 I'm known to get wrong off the get right 
 Hanging out the truck I blow the mausburg off 
 Who the head of your set I blow your boss shirt off 
 I be the top dawg killa, who the bomb don? 
 You're soft like a bon bon, in your Sean John 
 I'm riding dirtay up and down fort, escort 
 I'm in a Ringmaster gold super sport 
 And it's about to rain I see the weather bad 
 Hit the top on up like I better had 
 I cut back to the cut, to get a cut of my cut, 
 Because even in a hurricane a crack head will show up 
 I be the gang tag K-a, gay fag slayer, bag weigher 
 With a sweet street sweeped AK I don't care... 
 I like the darkness 
 It's 'bout to helly flow 
 Tornado sirens 
 Let it rain wicked shit 
 It's boring man, I'm smoking a blunt 
 It's pouring rain, the hood soaking it up 
 But it's getting kind of windy and the walls are shaking 
 Fucking roofs coming off I'm in a lazy boy, baking 
 I see the crack heads trying to reach the porch 
 But the wind sweep 'em off before they get to the door they only 90 pounds 
 Grab something held down, Because you looking funny flying around, FAG! 
 Blunt wrap on my lap, ash all over me 
 Playing Nintendo, mega man 4, from '93 
 Shudders are shaking and the lightning is frightening 
 Fucking windows are breaking; man I'm thinking it might be a tornado 
 Go to the door, open it up, yup, all the same back to my game 
 It's all right, along as that motherfucker stay outside I'm tight 
 I like the darkness 
 It's 'bout to helly flow 
 Tornado sirens 
 Let it rain wicked shit 
 Holy fucking shit what the fuck is happilating 
 The whole house spinning and shaking 
 Damn near breaking in half, I take it and laugh 
 Because what the fuck can I do? 
 I put the rocks in my sock so I don't lose them too, 
 I'm fucking hanging on I lost all but my drawers 
 Somehow my game's still good chilling on pause 
 We air born and the windows flying passing by 
 A crackheads waving at me still trying to buy 
 Mailboxes, a pizza man, some garbage cans 
 Then I seen a naked ass bitch like... damn! 
 There was all kind a crazy shit caught in the storm 
 But before long all that shit was gone...
