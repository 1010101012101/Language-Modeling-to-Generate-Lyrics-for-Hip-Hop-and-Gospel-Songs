Sometimes I miss the thrill of being brand new 
 There's nothing that I can do 
 To live it again but lookin' back all them years I ran through 
 Explorin through the halls up at moms work kickin it 
 My first time I hit a neden freakin that I'm stickin it 
 Lookin' for two letters rollin' in cheap for days 
 I miss sneakin into wrestling knowing the million ways 
 I miss ignoring the curfew and cuttin' through people yards 
 Duck and hide from cars that ninja suit was so hard 
 But it's still so much more and it's all brand new 
 As for the rest of it you can't do except let it go 
 Let it go cause there ain't shit you can do 
 Keep riding and enjoying the view 
 I miss hanging with Breed in mad clubs downtown 
 I miss seeing my homie Alex always around 
 I miss the days of shangri-la my navie bangin' hart 
 Bada Bing's in Orlando my favorite titty bar 
 Nelson ledges and wicked walk a tour with Bone Thugs 
 Nate the mac always haven my back I send him love 
 Some of us lost touch but we all remain true 
 There's so many yesterdays still everything is band new 
 There's so much coming ahead so much more to the show 
 As for everything else in the past you got to let it go 
 Let it go cause there ain't shit you can do 
 Keep riding and enjoying the view 
 I miss my son and my daughter tacking there very first steps 
 Sometimes I catch myself missing shit that ain't happen yet 
 Sometimes I wish it would remain and maintain forever 
 Still I've learned life will always change as sure as the weather 
 For worse or for better there's always turns and curves 
 Shit so clear in the day becomes all distant and blurred 
 I just enjoy the ride cause every day is brand new 
 As for the rest of it you can't do except let it go 
 Let it go cause there ain't shit you can do 
 Keep riding and enjoying the view 
 You oughta let it go 
 Let it go cause there ain't shit you can do 
 Keep riding and enjoying the view 
 Let it go 
 Let it go cause there ain't shit you can do 
 Keep riding and enjoying the view 
 You oughta let it go 
 Let it go cause there ain't shit you can do 
 Keep riding and enjoying the view 
 Let that shit go 
 There's so much coming ahead so much more to the show 
 As for everything else in the past you got to let it go 
 Let it go cause there ain't shit you can do 
 Keep riding and enjoying the view 
 Let it go 
 Let it go 
 You oughta let it go 
 Let that shit go
