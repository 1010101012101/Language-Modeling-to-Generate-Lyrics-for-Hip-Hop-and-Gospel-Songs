(Violent J) 
 These woods are looking scary everybody stay close to me 
 And we staying on track, 
 So that I can get back to Detroit like I'm supposed to be, 
 (Violent J, Scarecrow and Tin Man) 
 These woods are looking scary everybody stay close to me 
 And we staying on track, 
 So that J can get back to Detroit like he's supposed to be, 
 (Violent J) 
 So very scary, so dark, so Erie 
 For everybody near me, I'm weary 
 Fuck a cemetery 'cause they bury the dead 
 And very much I be alive, we seeing vines and hides 
 And all these trees that tower us 
 Are outta date and strung out 
 They spread stripes on your cheeks 
 When we slap your tongue out 
 This be the bad side of town, that got us looking around 
 They put it down we see a mushroom buggy 3 to the ground 
 And oh my god it's getting darker 
 Call me Peter Parker, 'cause spiders just biting 
 I'm hearing noises they frightening, 
 And I just realized something 
 Holding on to crow's hoodie 
 I'm getting' paranoid fast 
 Burning all this mud grass 
 Something is watching us, creeping around 
 I hear his feet to the ground 
 It's gone be beating us down 
 And half eaten when found, it sound decent tomorrow 
 (Tin Man) 
 Why you acting like a little bitch right now? 
 (Scarecrow) 
 And how! 
 Morbid Horrors, you can't ignore us 
 Horribly it's horrifying 
 Horror forest, something's before us 
 Horribly it's horrifying 
 Don't' be scared, Don't be scared, 
 Don't be scared, Don't be scared! 
 Morbid Horrors, May they be yours 
 Horribly it's horrifying 
 (Violent J) 
 What the Fuck, shh, I heard a branch snap, listen... 
 A twig break, a leaf crunch, somebody's pissing 
 (Tin Man) 
 Man get the fuck outta here with that bullshit, bro 
 (Scarecrow) 
 Let's just stick to the road, and be quick to the dro 
 (Violent J) 
 I took a shit in the woods and wiped my ass 
 With a purple mushroom 
 About an hour ago I assume 
 Maybe that's why I always feel 
 Like somebody's watching me 
 And I got no privacy 
 (The Lion) 
 Save it for your bedroom mirror, scream in fear 
 You was right, be scared, bitch, the lion is here 
 (Violent J) 
 Once I heard that, I knew that's all it would take 
 I started screaming like a cheerleader about to get raped 
 A big ass lion jumped out, like he was ready to fight 
 At least it's three against one, 
 But I'm the only one in sight 
 My two homies was gone, lost deep in the night 
 I pulled the blunt out looked at the lion, said, 
 'You gotta light?' 
 Morbid Horrors, you can't ignore us 
 Horribly it's horrifying 
 Horror forest, something's before us 
 Horribly it's horrifying 
 Don't' be scared, Don't be scared, 
 Don't be scared, Don't be scared! 
 Morbid Horrors, May they be yours 
 Horribly it's horrifying 
 (The Lion) 
 Hear the roar of the king of the jungle 
 It's me, not Tarzan, so go, I'm the lion, 
 You stepping on my turf 
 And one of y'all dying tonight that's for sure, 
 'That's for sure?' 
 You think it's your lucky day, you think I'm hear to play, 
 You saw the do not enter sign you had to cross it anyway 
 Reconsider killing you; don't even make me laugh 
 You stumbled in my kingdom; the next breath's your last... 
 (Violent J) 
 Mister, mister death and destruction 
 May I ask you a question you got everything 
 Why you fucking with something with nothing 
 We ain't even from around here we just passing through 
 You come crashing through; I'm only asking you... 
 (The Lion) 
 Truth is I'm bored, everybody scared of me, 
 I smelled y'all over 
 Here puffing the lovely, and fuck that blunt, facts, 
 I'm just gonna ask 
 Do any y'all motherfuckers no where the hoes at? 
 (Violent J) 
 Maybe on the southwest side, I know a few 
 But straight up I know them hoes ain't trying' to fuck you 
 (The Lion) 
 How 'bout I swipe your head off? 
 (Violent J) 
 How about you relax 
 I'm only saying these hoes don't fuck half lions like that 
 But I know this one player, this pimp right here in town 
 He's got mad furry bitches 
 That be swinging they tails round 
 His name is the Wizard, fact that's were we headed 
 (The Lion) 
 Don't mind if I do tag along, fucking get me some neden... 
 Morbid Horrors, you can't ignore us 
 Horribly it's horrifying 
 Horror forest, something's before us 
 Horribly it's horrifying 
 Don't' be scared, Don't be scared, 
 Don't be scared, Don't be scared! 
 Morbid Horrors, May they be yours 
 Horribly it's horrifying
