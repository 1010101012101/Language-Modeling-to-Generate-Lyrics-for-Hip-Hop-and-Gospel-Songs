 Supafly on the track 
 It's real big tonight 
 Super Big 
 C'mon 
 It's that time again and the place to be 
 Hands in the air, if you really wanna party I'll take you there 
 Everybody get your groove on everywhere, everywhere 
 It's that time again and the place to be 
 I love to see, everybody wanna party with a DPG 
 Take a toast and nigga get ready for the good part 
 Here we go again Crenshaw Boulevard 
 Hittin switches in the fours again 
 Time to go Spring Break shoppin' and get some clothes again 
 All Eyes as we rollin' in under the end ? lewis 
 Hit the Beverly Center the Hennessey and mystic 
 Mixed with this Indo got me lifted 
 O-Dizzle with the bomb dizzle now my nizzle bizzle twist it 
 Be legit it stack, now let me hit it 
 Ladies chase me and bustas scheme 
 See me caught up in the twist as I bust this dream 
 Too fly when we cruise by 
 Me and my Westside riders and plus my original squad 
 In PA sippin E & J 
 Dippin the everyday Chevrolets candy painted 
 Got my eyes wide shut 
 Kick back for a minute 
 Let my high rise up 
 I can't be faded tough guys wise up 
 It's that time again and the place to be 
 Hands in the air, if you really wanna party I'll take you there 
 Everybody get your groove on everywhere, everywhere 
 It's that time again and the place to be 
 I love to see, everybody wanna party with a DPG 
 Take a toast and nigga get ready for the good part 
 You wanna party with a DPG 
 Come and holla at me 
 I'll be up in Dark House with all the homies 
 Poppin' my call happy 
 Doin' it big as ever 
 In the City of Angels, Devils and pretty weather 
 The shark packed with bumper to bumper traffic 
 All bouncin' and 40 ouncin 
 Hydraulic wit it, alcoholic wit it 
 Bumper paint and polished demolished 
 But we ain't trippin' we got heavy wallets 
 Sittin' on dubs, rollin' on three wheels 
 On the Four with mugs and Four with big wheels 
 Just breezing, and all the non-believers eventually end up believing 
 Roscoe de Soto the brown bomber 
 Philly fanatic automatic packin with my khakis saggin 
 Philaphorn I-A, Y-A where everyday is Friday 
 C'mon 
 It's that time again and the place to be 
 Hands in the air, if you really wanna party I'll take you there 
 Everybody get your groove on everywhere, everywhere 
 It's that time again and the place to be 
 I love to see, everybody wanna party with a DPG 
 Take a toast and nigga get ready for the good part 
 You know the Young Assassins gon get it crackin' 
 Everytime we mashin 
 Runnin' 'em up, actin' a straight nut 
 When the Yak in my cup spills, I get a refill 
 Enemies plottin on me y'all better keep chill 
 I put it down like a G supposed to 
 And show you something that only a G could show you 
 Makin' all the cheese leavin' mice with tofu 
 Young but I'm cool laid back and old school 
 Come here girl let me show you how to G Walk 
 And maybe after we could sneak off 
 Talent scout with a casting couch 
 If you ain't got no talent ya gotta get out 
 Let me rock the breezies one time 
 With my bump rhyme 
 I show them how to do the snake with they jaw line 
 I'm DP'ed out 
 With every piece of love in the club that could follow me out 
 And they all mine 
 It's that time again and the place to be 
 Hands in the air, if you really wanna party I'll take you there 
 Everybody get your groove on everywhere, everywhere 
 It's that time again and the place to be 
 I love to see, everybody wanna party with a DPG 
 Take a toast and nigga get ready for the good part
