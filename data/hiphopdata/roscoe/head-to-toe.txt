Man Pass that, what 
 'Cause that's they lace (From head to toe) 
 Got the three will motion (Sick and so low) 
 Such a good feeling (and I'm so high) 
 I blow my smoke in the sky (Caught up against the crack) 
 Low key OG', it's Roscoe the soto 
 I'm blowin' dodo on a low low, duckin from the popo 
 I'm known to hit the city traffic Grippin the millimatic for static 
 Catch me up all up ya' Bentley jackin' 
 Your stereo system drillinatics 
 When I'm open for the law Through it all, 
 We deliquents Yeah A-wall and juvi hall 
 With a stink cent, from chronic dogg 
 Through out my car, THC all through all my cigar 
 With a drink bent, about to vomit all over the yard 
 My loose spits freely roamin' the reservoir 
 My tooth chipped, now I spit better bars 
 My crew sick, pursuing the stars and to shoe fits 
 We're not the ones to hate on a fool with on-ones 
 The wrong young guns to screw with 
 We assassins, from head to toe 
 Stay in tune with, ball with us, it's Russian rulette 
 'Cause that's they lace (From head to toe) 
 Got the three will motion (Sick and so low) 
 Such a good feeling (and I'm so high) 
 I blow my smoke in the sky (Caught up against the crack) 
 Hey, the way I feel, I like smoking 
 Ah hurry up showty', roll the joint 
 Oh work it out little mama 
 Let me see your ass scrub the floor 
 And oh lord, the straigh henessey hit me in the spot 
 And oh lord, party like it's the last day you got 
 'Cause that's they lace (From head to toe) 
 Got the three will motion (Sick and so low) 
 Such a good feeling (and I'm so high) 
 I blow my smoke in the sky (Caught up against the crack) 
 Yeah, they call me young sco' goodie 
 Dungeon Family, from ATL to LA all day and philly philly 
 See me dippin' with my Eastside thugs and my Westside gangstas 
 Get with the perty mild, reppin' the dirty south 
 Roscoe, Keko, Rico, Sleepy and Cee-lo 
 Yeah, we rollin' Geo's on the d-lo in g-mode 
 Now this is what sounds like, when the g's cry 
 We ease up, speed by ya, and squeeze fire 
 I'm bicostal don, I'm off the wire, in all bulletproof attire 
 Until the day I retire, 
 Me and bro, we share two heeps and one vest 
 We keep em' underneath the seat, 
 So come test the young jack rabbit, with a bad habbit 
 The jab rabbit, rap addict 
 Ever since I first took a stab at it 
 Up in the lab slash attic 
 With the studio set up, and the walls padded 
 Yeah 
 'Cause that's they lace (From head to toe) 
 Got the three will motion (Sick and so low) 
 Such a good feeling (and I'm so high) 
 I blow my smoke in the sky (Caught up against the crack) 
 'Cause that's they lace (From head to toe) 
 Got the three will motion (Sick and so low) 
 Such a good feeling (and I'm so high)
