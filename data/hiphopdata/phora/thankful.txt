Never happy but always thankful 
 Never satisfied but always grateful 
 I put my past aside and focus on the future 
 But it's difficult when cats who used to like you start to hate you 
 And I owe this to my mom for puttin' up with me 
 All throughout these years when ain't nobody wanna fuck with me 
 They used to say I lacked the confidence to set the path 
 But I got a big heart I just let it pass 
 Often I sit and wonder bout what I'll be remembered as 
 To these kids I wanna be that hero that I never had 
 But then y'all wanna shape me up into a villain 
 And grow off of my downfall and break apart all my feelings 
 But I ain't trippin' 'cause I'm learning to accept the facts 
 Yeah, people come and people go but friends will never last 
 Yeah, and I was wrong in the past 
 Then I realized that all could be gone in a flash, so I'm thankful 
 I'm thankful for the haters 
 'Cause at the end of the day, it's all just motivation 
 And I'm thankful for my family 
 'Cause all I really want is for someone to say that they're proud of me 
 And I'm thankful for my struggles 
 'Cause if everything was easy I wouldn't know how to hustle 
 And most of all I'm thankful for my life, Lord 
 Forgive me for my sins, you know I'm trying to do right, look 
 Now all my exes send me texts sayin' that they miss my voice 
 And how they hate thinkin' 'bout me but they don't have a choice 
 'Cause all your friends talkin' about me so you can't ignore me. 
 I put my life into this shit, you should be happy for me. 
 Blood, sweat, and tears over the years 
 Now that I'm gettin' what I deserve 
 Y'all niggas, damn you got some nerve to tell me 
 That I've changed and you think the fame is getting to me 
 But if that's what you think of me then you never knew me. 
 Yeah, 'cause I just want to make a difference 
 And I wanna thank the fans and everybody out there listening 
 'Cause if I died before I made a change, just know I tried to 
 But most of all, remember that I'm just like you 
 I just want to make a difference 
 And I wanna thank the fans and everybody out there listening 
 'Cause if I died before I made a change, just know I tried to 
 But most of all, remember that I'm just like you 
 I'm thankful for the haters 
 'Cause at the end of the day, it's all just motivation 
 And I'm thankful for my family 
 'Cause all I really want is someone to say that they proud of me 
 And I'm thankful for my struggles 
 'Cause if everything was easy I wouldn't know how to hustle 
 And most of all I'm thankful for my life, Lord 
 Forgive me for my sins, you know I'm trying to do right, look
