The only things guaranteed in live is death, trouble, and taxes 
 Only way you'll succeed in life is to step up and then grab it 
 With everyday that passes I learn my lessons from actions 
 That led to being mistakes 
 Yet I never regret my past 
 And I know, yeah I know some niggas envy my position 
 I keep hearing these rumors, but they tell me not to listen 
 I keep having these nightmares, but they help me write these lyrics 
 And it's so deep from the soul she said she felt me by a spirit 
 Mother, dear mother, far to many of you crying 
 Brother, dear brother, far to many of you dying 
 They tryna hold me back, but naw I'll never stop trying 
 To steer my people away from the ignorance and violence 
 I'm sick of living through the week with a frown 
 And I hate that it's our own people that's keeping us down 
 But I never let them take away my reason to smile 
 Death is lurking through my city, and it's creepin' around 
 I'm prepared for when it reaches me 
 So I'm studying the bible and I'm utilizing everything it teaches me 
 Practice what I preach, I never follow from the TV screen 
 They say have faith in god, but I just hope he believes in me 
 And I'm just looking for acceptance 
 Jesus didn't run when everybody turned against him 
 Judas showed his jealousy and broke apart the friendship 
 Betrayal, the lord will take his vengeance 
 I just wish my people would understand the reason why I wrote this 
 But you probably just like the beat and you didn't really notice 
 I'm trying to spill my soul out in hopes that you can feel me 
 I'm trying to change the world and save a life before they kill me 
 And I pray that I make it to my 18th birthday 
 Not the type to spit a bunch of metaphors and wordplay 
 I speak from the heart, write about the shit that matters 
 To be honest, I'm not really any emcee or a rapper 
 I'm just a regular kid putting words over beats 
 And my soul is blinded with the urge to be free 
 Be you, stay positive and follow your dream 
 Just make sure that you can trust the cats that's part of your team 
 'Cause jealousy runs deep within the blood of a coward 
 And they'll say that your his brother but he's gonna turn sour 
 When he sees your success and progression 
 But just keep moving along and never question your blessings 
 And I ain't scared to fall 
 Naw, I've hit the bottom before 
 I remember sleeping my niggas Honda Accord 
 We get sick of dealing with all the problems of course 
 Every time I try to ignore, shit I thought of it more 
 But that's just another day I stay content with the sour 
 So I'll bow my head and pray for a better tomorrow 
 Yeah, it's just another day, I stay content with the sour 
 So I'll bow my head and I'll pray for a better tomorrow
