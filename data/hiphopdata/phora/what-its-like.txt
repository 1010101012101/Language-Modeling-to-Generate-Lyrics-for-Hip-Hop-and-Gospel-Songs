I know what it's like to feel so hopeless 
 But you gotta keep going man 
 Just stay focused, just stay focused, yeah, just stay focused 
 Focus on the good shit, forget about the past 
 Focus on what you got, not the things you never had 
 'Cause it ain't that bad, as the world keeps spinning 
 Either you dyin' or you livin' 
 Ever since I can remember they said I couldn't do it 
 Tatts all over told them my future was ruined 
 But I told them "get to know me first yeah, I'm still human" 
 Grandpa asked me "what the hell you think you doing?" 
 I told him "I'm making music, you should take a listen 
 I know I ain't the best but I ain't talking about no bitches 
 I'm talkin' about no cars or cooking crack in moms kitchen 
 I'm talkin' about life and everything that's in my vision" 
 Man I swear I'm so thankful for the things I was given 
 Speak on what I learned, hoping I can make a difference 
 Speak to my boy that keeps going back to prison 
 At the end of the day you gotta pay for your decisions 
 I swear man I miss him, never get the chance to visit 
 Ask what my goal is, it's just to keep living, just keep living 
 Yeah, it's just to keep living, just to keep... 
 I know what it's like to feel so hopeless 
 But you gotta keep going man 
 Just stay focused, just stay focused, yeah, just stay focused 
 Focus on the good shit, forget about the past 
 Focus on what you got, not the things you never had 
 'Cause it ain't that bad, as the world keeps spinning 
 Either you dyin' or you livin' 
 Even when it's all bad, I still keep my head up 
 It'll go away, I promise, life will get better 
 And I hate to see my boy walking around with a Beretta 
 Gotta watch his back he said our police don't protect us 
 He ain't got a girl 'cause he thinks he gon' get set up 
 All that's on his mind is makin' that chedda 
 And I said that's cool, but what you gonna do when you get it? 
 You're gonna buy some weed 
 You're gonna put it in the bank and get interest 
 Listen, just think of yo' future 
 If you got that money, don't think these cats will hesitate to shoot you 
 Look, all I'm saying is be cool bro 
 Never heard from him again, I hope he's cool tho 
 I'm doing things I never thought of 
 Came a long way from sleeping in my niggas honda 
 Ask me for a quarter, I'll probably give you a dollar 
 More you do good, less chance of meeting karma 
 I try to stay away from drama, 'cause everywhere I go now 
 Been so many places, but it's nothing like my hometown 
 Heard some people hate us here, they don't even know us 
 Yeah I'm still a kid but these niggas need to grow up 
 And to tell you the truth, I'm the only person I can think of that's 
 Buying kids from the hood, cheese burgers and sodas 
 I just wanna make a change, man I swear 
 The money and the fame ain't why I'm here, I been working so hard 
 Y'all should be glad for me, instead of everyone turnin' they back on me 
 But it's all right, yeah it's all right 
 I know what it's like to feel so hopeless 
 But you gotta keep going man 
 Just stay focused, just stay focused, yeah, just stay focused 
 Focus on the good shit, forget about the past 
 Focus on what you got, not the things you never had 
 'Cause it ain't that bad, as the world keeps spinning 
 Either you dyin' or you livin'
