When the sun goes down I bow my head and pray 
 For my family and sins and those who've passed away 
 It truly amazes me the things that I've seen 
 And it seems so surreal 'cause it ain't make-believe 
 And best believe when you lose a loved one six feet deep 
 It'll tear you into two as you lay without sleep 
 Welcome to reality, what they said to me 
 But this death ain't no motherfuckin' stranger to me 
 Grandmama says stare at the cross 
 When I'm filled with evil, when I'm out feelin' lost 
 'Cause I remember when I hit the bottom of the rock 
 And I looked up to the Lord and asking, "Would it ever stop?" 
 This hate and this gat, I'd rather love than live 
 Give back to my folks for all the things they've ever did 
 I express my love and I give thanks 
 To my moms and pops, I love you till my never-ending day 
 And I was placed here on earth to spread this message 
 You won't read the note I wrote until I end up where I'm headed. 
 When the sun goes down I bow my head and pray 
 For my family and sins and those who've passed away 
 It truly amazes me the things that I've seen 
 And it seems so surreal 'cause it ain't make-believe. 
 When the sun goes down, it always seems to rise again 
 A new day is born, a new life to live 
 And I ain't got no dough, I just got some advice to give 
 If you fall on your ass, get up and try again 
 Make sure you love yourself before you die within 
 We all go through similar struggles 
 And it's hard to find the light when you livin' so subtle 
 How will I enjoy my life when I keep dinner with trouble? 
 I don't care what they have to say about me 
 'Cause I ain't got nothin' to prove 
 I used to be that low life with nothin' to lose 
 They kicked me when I was down and they spit on my shoes 
 Suicidal thoughts, I didn't know what to do 
 Then I prayed to God for answers, didn't know who else to turn to 
 Sick of people speakin' on that shit that don't concern you 
 Have you ever loved somebody so bad it fuckin' hurts you? 
 Searchin' for a better life but patience is a virtue 
 And I don't know how much longer I can wait 
 And I don't know how much more pain I can take 
 It's only a matter of time before I meet my fate 
 So I pray, and I pray, 'cause it's never too late 
 Ask God for forgiveness for your past mistakes 
 And heal the scars for family that passed away 
 To help you see the light in the blackest days. 
 'Cause when the sun goes down it doesn't last a day. 
 Ask God for forgiveness for your past mistakes 
 Heal the scars for family that passed away 
 To help you see the light in the blackest days 
 'Cause when the sun goes down it doesn't last a day, it doesn't last a day.
