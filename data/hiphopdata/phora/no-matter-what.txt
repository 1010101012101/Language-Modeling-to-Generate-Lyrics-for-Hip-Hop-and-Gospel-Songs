She said, 'No matter what you do 
 No matter where you go 
 Baby you'll always be the one for me 
 (Always be the one for me) 
 Even if you leave I'll never let you go 
 Even after all the things you done to me 
 (All the things done to me) 
 No matter what you do 
 No matter where you go 
 Baby you'll always be the one for me 
 (Always be the one for me) 
 I just thought I had to let you know 
 Even after all the things you've done to me 
 (All the things you've done to me 
 She said, "I'm here for you no matter what 
 Even after all the fame, groupies and the cameras 
 Even after all your so-called homies turned their backs 
 They say they down but yo their word ain't jack 
 In fact, even after the curtains close and the moneys gone 
 I'm still here even after all the times you've done me wrong 
 Know I gotta have some patients with you 
 Girls probably sending you naked pictures 
 Hope you ain't laying with 'em 
 Yeah, and if you ever do leave 
 All I really want is for you to promise you'll take me with ya 
 (Promise you'll take me with yah 
 Or at least take a memory 
 'Cause if you gone I don't know how much love is gonna be left in me 
 And when you next to me at night it sets the mood right 
 Think about our future as I stare into the mood light 
 I'm the only one who truly understands you 
 I know what you thinkin' I don't ever have to ask you 
 But every time you're gone, apart of me is missing 
 When you come back my love for you is never different 
 Now the feeling never changes 
 I here for you whether your broke, dirty and smelly 
 These girls love you 'cause you famous." 
 She said, 'No matter what you do 
 No matter where you go 
 Baby you'll always be the one for me 
 (Always be the one for me) 
 Even if you leave I'll never let you go 
 Even after all the things you done to me 
 (All the things done to me) 
 No matter what you do 
 No matter where you go 
 Baby you'll always be the one for me 
 (Always be the one for me) 
 I just thought I had to let you know 
 Even after all the things you've done to me

 Look 
 She said, 'I know you stressin' but you drinking to much 
 I feel like we growin' distance 
 We ain't speakin' enough 
 Every time I try to talk to with you, you say you 'okay.' 
 But I know something is wrong, and I can see through your bluff 
 I just wanna know what I can do to help you get through it 
 Communication is key, but sometimes you act stupid 
 Sometimes you play games 
 Sometimes you so difficult 
 Sometimes you drive me crazy 
 And sometimes we on a different note 
 But I know, I can feel it in my soul 
 Whatever brought us together had plans for us to be close 
 I mean, just don't take me for granted 
 If you want every second of my time then you can have it 
 The only thing you don't have is the right to take advantage 
 I hope you never try 'cause my heart is already damaged 
 And 
 I don't expect for you to fix it 
 But I expect that you respect my feelings and you listen 
 That's why I'm here 
 And you need me like I need you 
 No matter what I got you, and never will I leave you 
 So grab my hand and tell me you won't ever go 
 I wanna say 'forever' but you never know 
 She said, 'No matter what you do 
 No matter where you go 
 Baby you'll always be the one for me 
 (Always be the one for me) 
 Even if you leave I'll never let you go 
 Even after all the things you done to me 
 (All the things done to me) 
 No matter what you do 
 No matter where you go 
 Baby you'll always be the one for me 
 (Always be the one for me)
