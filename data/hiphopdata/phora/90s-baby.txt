I said I'm about to take this back to 09' 
 Bombin' train yards never black bookin' 
 Like I was on my skateboard 
 Gotta keep it pushin' now these cats are steady looking 
 'Cause they ain't never heard a rapper 
 From the West Coast spit like this before 
 Now they tryna jack my style so they switch they flow 
 But I'm too smooth for these cats and they too typical ay yo, 
 But I ain't hatin' homie get cha paper 
 But just don't walk around my city like you can relate 
 'Cause you don't come from where we come from 
 I'm just talkin' that real dollar menu 
 Was my dinner never no home-cooked meals 
 So what's the deal? 
 Rappers braggin' 'bout riches sayin' they better than 
 Only makes me remember back to the shit I never had 
 No money in my pockets still I kept a smile 
 Wasn't rockin' the latest shoes had my own style 
 And meanwhile they stuck in fraudulent fantasies 
 While I was out chasin' my dreams now they mad at me 
 (Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it movin'...) 
 Keep it pushin' 
 (Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it movin'...) 
 I gotta keep it pushin' now these cats is steady lookin' 
 Hate it or love it the underdogs on top 
 And I'mma shine even after my fuckin' heart stops 
 And I guarantee you everything I told you I was the truth 
 And the ones who doubt me have never been around me I can teach you, 
 How to read a motherfucka's face until he's see-through 
 And make a man's confidence drop to the ground when he sees you, 
 The difference between you and I, you can live without it 
 Me I either do it or die to tell you the truth you a lie 
 And your whole fuckin' image is so deceiving 
 I'm the future and you the only nigga who don't believe it 
 I can break your words to pieces and say clean up the mess 
 But I ain't with that, 'cause the best revenge is success 
 So take it how you want motherfucka it ain't a diss 
 All I'm tryna say is that jealousy is a bitch 
 I try to keep it cool but there's only so much a nigga could take 
 And tryna play me was your biggest mistake 
 (Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it movin'...) 
 Keep it pushin' 
 (Keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it, keep it movin'...) 
 I gotta keep it pushin' now these cats is steady lookin'
