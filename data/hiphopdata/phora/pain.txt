Although I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
 I fear no man but God as I take my last breath 
 Used to beg them to stay and they'd just ask me to leave 
 You don't know what strugglin' means until they shatter your dreams 
 Keep moving, no matter if them fuckers wanna doubt you nigga 
 Never been fed with a silver spoon, what about you nigga? 
 From the cradle to my motherfuckin' grave bitch 
 Heard my momma cryin' homie, I ain't been the same since 
 Blue skies turnin' white, theirs blood on the pavement 
 And all they ever ask me is "Phora how did you make it?" 
 Not "where did you come from?" or "tell me your story" 
 Theirs a difference between cats who want something from and for me 
 But I ain't trippin', they tellin' me to settle down 
 Aha but I ain't settlin' for nothin' 
 And the people I hung around would just let me down 
 Eventually I was the only one I trusted 
 Real talk, I try not to show emotion 
 A lot of shit inside me I won't put out in the open 
 I hope I never snap, Lord knows that I'm destined for greatness 
 But those niggas keep testin' my patience, I got 
 Pain in my heart, tryna not to let it show 
 They ask me if I'm ready, I never said no way 
 But you really never know 
 I just close my eyes and imagine 
 And just try to fly away 
 Aiming for tomorrow but we dying by the day 
 I'll be the first one to say I cry I ain't ashamed 
 They keep tellin' me to smile but yo I'm tryna find a way 
 Losing touch to myself tears droppin' to the pavement 
 Honestly I don't know how much longer I can take it 
 And I know how it feels to lose all everyone that you love 
 And start question the one up above 
 Like why do all the good people gotta die 
 And why these young kids victim to a homicide 
 I don't know but I'm still searchin' for the answers 
 Haven't smoked since my grandfather died from cancer 
 So don't take offense when I don't hit the blunt with you 
 'Cause there's a reason, it don't mean that I don't fuck wit you 
 All it means is that you don't know what I'm going through 
 Don't ask to talk about it, it's not something that I'm open to 
 Behind every smile is a number of tears 
 Told myself that I have nothing to fear 
 But little did I know when you keep all that pain inside 
 You'll be your own worst enemy till the day you die 
 Pain in my heart, tryna not to let it show 
 They ask me if I'm ready, I never said no way 
 But you really never know
