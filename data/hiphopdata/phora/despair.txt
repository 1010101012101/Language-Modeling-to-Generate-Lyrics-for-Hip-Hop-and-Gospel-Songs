Last night I tried to call you, but I ain't get no answer 
 I tried to call again, and sent a text two minutes after 
 And it kinda drives me crazy, 'cause I know you see me calling you 
 Giving me the silent treatment, I just wanna talk to you 
 I know I'm not perfect, and I hurt you before 
 But I can't help the situation if I'm getting ignored 
 What happened to us and the love we used to have for each other? 
 Road trips, and the plans with each other 
 I guess their gone, already made your decision 
 But aye, the more I tried the more you drifted away 
 And It was probably never you intention to stay 
 And knowing that, it's hard to get through my day 
 Constantly on my mind, I'm always thinking on what we coulda been 
 Hate all the mistakes I made, I dwell on what I shoulda did 
 I bet that you regret the very day that you found me 
 You'd honestly probably do better without me 
 But I'm tryna give you all the happiness that's left in me 
 Although it isn't much, nah it isn't much 
 And with that said thank you for the memories 
 Guess that's the end of us, yeah that's the end of us 
 But I'm tryna give you all the happiness that's left in me 
 Although it isn't much, nah it isn't much 
 And with that said thank you for the memories 
 Guess that's the end of us, yeah that's the end of us 
 Look, I just wish that we could see our pride to the side 
 But I'm too stubborn yo I tried and I tried 
 Maybe I just didn't give you enough of my time 
 Or maybe I was just getting to outta line 
 But either way I take the blame for the mistakes I made 
 Scarred from the past and our memories are razor blades 
 And your voice is like a 4-5 to my dome piece 
 The very day you left I started drinking with the homies 
 'Cause I got nowhere to run to, no where to pour my feelings out 
 So I keep 'em bottled up inside until I spill 'em out 
 And I can be there for you, to kiss you and hug you 
 But the worst part is that you said you never felt like I loved you 
 But I'm tryna give you all the happiness that's left in me 
 Although it isn't much, nah it isn't much 
 And with that said thank you for the memories 
 Guess that's the end of us, yeah that's the end of us 
 But I'm tryna give you all the happiness that's left in me 
 Although it isn't much, nah it isn't much 
 And with that said thank you for the memories 
 Guess that's the end of us, yeah that's the end of us
