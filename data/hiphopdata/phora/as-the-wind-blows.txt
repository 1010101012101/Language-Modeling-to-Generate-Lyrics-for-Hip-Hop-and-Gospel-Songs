It's kind of funny 
 I'm old enough to go to war but not to drink 
 When they locked me in the box I had a lot of time to think 
 It's Hell on Earth 
 The Devil wants your soul for what it's worth 
 But he won't take it homie, never not from me 
 'Cause in this cold world that's all I got 
 That's my everything 
 And gang-bangers are holocaust of the century 
 Whose really your enemy? 
 Answer the question. 
 They said I need help 
 Give me therapy 
 I cancelled the session 
 Because 
 Nobody knows yourself more than you 
 And I have no explanation for the things I do 
 I just hope you know I ain't the villain 
 God is my witness 
 Him and I 
 Are the only ones that know my true intentions 
 But I could tell you once 
 And I could tell you twice 
 But only you control the choices you make in your life 
 Whether it's wrong or right 
 We all have a place 
 Don't judge me for my flaws 
 But what I learned from my mistakes 
 Trust nowadays 
 Is difficult to come by 
 Lie too many times you'll eventually get your tongue tied 
 Only almost everyone I know sits around getting dumb high 
 While I sit in my room and plan and plot till the sunrise 
 Love it or hate it 
 Regardless I'mma flourish 
 A rebel to the grain 
 The ones who follow have no courage 
 They used to put me down 
 Until they see me shine 
 Now I'm laughing when they ask me for a second of my time 
 I put everything on the line 
 Until I had nothing left 
 They'll hear my voice until they very last fucking breath 
 Until I had nothing left 
 They'll hear my voice until they very last fucking breath 
 As the wind blows 
 I'm looking out my window 
 Wondering if life will ever show me the light 
 'Cause all I see is footsteps in the darkness 
 Shadows behind me 
 And shady people so heartless 
 The ones with no soul or remorse 
 They want to bring me down 
 Yeah I know but of course 
 I watch my back and I take care of my kin folk 
 Yeah we dying every second as the wind blows 
 Yeah I'm looking out my window 
 Wondering if life will ever show me the light 
 'Cause all I see is footsteps in the darkness 
 Shadows behind me 
 And shady people so heartless 
 The ones with no souls or remorse 
 They want to bring me down 
 Yeah I know but of course 
 I watch my back and I take care of my kin folk 
 Yeah we dying every second as the wind blows 
 Looking out my window 
 Show me the light
