God gives the toughest battles to the strongest of his people 
 Just make sure you good with karma when it meets you 
 It's evil, it'll haunt you, it'll eat you 
 It'll take away your peace of mind and blind you and deceive you 
 Never let 'em get to your soul 
 'Cause we all got a place in this world 
 We just might not know where to go 
 See I'm here for a reason and I'm right where I'm supposed to be 
 And all I know is that God is watching over me 
 Look, this life's a blessing for real 
 Jesus on my necklace, man the pressure is real 
 Ambulance and gunshots, ghetto bird on my block 
 Can't even trust the cops, they don't protect, they just kill 
 So pops told me, pack a weapon for real 
 'Cause the world is cold and it'll never respect how you feel 
 I know exactly what he meant when he said jealously kills 
 As I try to take a breath, but I feel like I'm choking on my own blood 
 Sick of these streets 'cause they show us no love 
 I'da seen cats bag up drugs and slang to they own son 
 This shit ain't no fun 
 They carrying heaters 'cause they got cold blood 
 They'll never see me weak and I won't run 
 Gotta watch my back every motherfucking day 
 At the same time never look back and look for a way to make it out these streets 
 Yeah, some people never make it out these streets 
 And they shooting at me, felt like a nightmare 
 Never understood why these cowards just couldn't fight fair 
 Always need a weapon, but this life is such a blessing 
 They pull the trigger, my guardian angel was sitting right there 
 You don't believe in God? Explain this, they killed my ass twice 
 And I still lived and all it did was make me famous 
 And appreciate life in ways I couldn't explain 
 Bullet in my head a few inches away from my brain 
 Homie I'm blessed to be alive and still breathing 
 But what's it gonna take to show these people that I'm here for a reason? 
 I said I'm blessed to be alive and still breathing 
 But what's it gonna take to show these people that I'm here for a reason? 
 One o'clock in the morning, heading back home 
 Driving down the freeway, just me and my girl 
 Talking 'bout our future, talking 'bout life 
 Talking 'bout these places that we tryna be in this world 
 As I look to my left, I seen a car approaching from a distance 
 And all I heard was, pop-pop-pop, what? I'm tripping 
 Could this be a hit-man? They letting shots off 
 And ninety off the freeway and dipped as soon as it popped off 
 Bullets burning in the back of my neck 
 Blood leaking down my back 
 Windows shattered as I'm gasping for breath 
 Bullets scorching as it ran through my flesh 
 Heart pumping, blood rushing 
 Felt the adrenaline pass through my chest 
 Thinking if I die tonight, they probably laugh at my death 
 But God has my back and that's why I'm blessed 
 I asked my girl if she was hit, but she was panicking 
 I checked her body, she was fine 
 But she seen I got shot and called the ambulance 
 Yeah, in the back of the ambulance 
 I just thought, are they following me? 
 Did someone set me up? Is somebody plotting on me? 
 They tryna kill me, they really tryna kill me again 
 Don't wanna die without saying bye to my mama, my friends 
 Only twenty years old living in this world, so cold 
 Hoping my family don't have to see me go 
 I'm in the hospital fighting to survive 
 Fighting to stay alive, doctors keep telling me not to close my eyes 
 They saying, "Stay with me. Deep breaths, just breathe." 
 In and out, out and in, veins filled with IVs 
 I closed my eyes, thought of the skies and the trees 
 Asked God to bless me just one more time 
 Almost dropped to my knees 
 Now I'm back up on my feet, I shoulda died that night 
 Three shots from a 45 went through my ride that night 
 Hit me two inches from my spine, I coulda been paralyzed 
 Guess you can say that Destiny was by my side that night 
 I shoulda died that night 
 Three shots from a 45 went through my ride that night 
 Hit me two inches from my spine, I coulda been paralyzed 
 Guess you can say that Destiny was by my side that night 
 'Cause everybody wanna ride or die chick 
 But she the true meaning of ride or die 
 When them bullets went right through my whip 
 'Cause she was by my side the night I got hit 
 And still riding with me till the day I die 
 See that's a wife, not a bitch 
 Just wanna see her happy, I'd give my life for that shit 
 I'd take a 45, a 9, even a knife for that shit 
 I know I wasn't perfect, we had our fights 
 But I'mma make things right 'cause we only got one life and that's it 
 But never let these cats take your peace of mind or your smile from you 
 No matter how hard they trying, no matter what they try to do 
 I'll always be right there to the side of you 
 We got the choice to be happy or not 
 The only one that can decide is you 
 But sometimes I'm mad at myself 
 Sometimes I ask these people questions I can answer myself 
 Sometimes I wish I could show these cats how I felt 
 But I know karma's a motherfucking bitch and its gon' handle itself 
 Three people in my car that night, me, Destiny and God 
 Like why the Lord keep letting me survive? 
 I'm so blessed that I'm alive 
 But truth is they coulda put that bullet through my head 
 But dog legends never die 
 I said legends never die, I just wanna be remembered 
 They can kill me, but that'll only mean I'll live forever 
 I said legends never die, I just wanna be remembered 
 They can kill me, but that'll only mean I'll live forever motherfucker
