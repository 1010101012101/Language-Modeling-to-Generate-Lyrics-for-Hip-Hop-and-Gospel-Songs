I know it ain't easy 
 (Hey, hey, yeah) 
 But we gotta move on 
 I know it gets stressful 
 (Hey, hey, yeah) 
 But we gotta stay strong 
 Don't let 'em treat you less than 
 (Hey, hey, yeah) 
 Every time you do wrong 
 (Nhh, nah) 
 Just move on 
 (Aye, aye) 
 It's a cold war, and I ain't rockin' no Jay's 
 I got holes in my socks, checkin' my pockets for change. 
 I wish my life was different 
 And if I could go back in time, I would change 90 percent of my decisions. 
 But I never liked to listen to any of advice that's given 
 And I guess that's the reason why I live this life I'm livin' 
 I hate that all my families shamed 
 A black sheep I found myself the day insanity came 
 But is life worth dealin' with the damage and pain 
 Which I brought upon myself but someone has to be blamed 
 And I don't joke about my death but sometimes 
 I just wanna put a rope around my neck and let it choke me out to rest 
 So I can, speed up the process because I know I'm probably next 
 Wouldn't that be nice, and the devil caught me slippin' once 
 I ain't even gonna front 
 But I pray to the man above that he doesn't catch me twice 
 And lately I'm havin' nightmares, I'm tossin' and turnin' 
 When I sleep, I dream of genocides, slaughterings, burnings 
 But I just can't point out the message that my thoughts are preservin'. 
 I just know I'm right with God, and I'm certain 
 That he will guide me through my trials and tribulations 
 Bow my head and pray and that's my rehabilitation 
 That he will guide me through my trials and tribulations 
 Bow my head and pray and that's my rehabilitation 
 I know it ain't easy 
 (Hey, hey, yeah) 
 But we gotta move on 
 I know it gets stressful 
 (Hey, hey, yeah) 
 But we gotta stay strong 
 Don't let 'em treat you less than 
 (Hey, hey, yeah) 
 Every time you do wrong 
 (Nah, nah) 
 Just move on 
 (Aye, aye) 
 To my people in the struggle, keep movin' 
 Never give up, be you. Try not to lose it 
 I know it's hard not to, I'm speakin' from experience 
 Think of things you got dude, not of the shit you didn't get 
 God gave you life, don't take it for granted 
 But it's hard to appreciate something so fuckin' demandin' 
 Always gotta give, and you never get in return 
 Numb to the pain but I still think I'm feelin' the burn 
 Word to the father taking care of they daughter or son 
 Let's make a change, but we can't stop till the problem is done 
 Fourteen, can't even spell his own name 
 But he got something to prove, 'cause an OG got him a gun 
 Now he killin' for him, careful in disguise ain't no dealin' with sin 
 Your death is your demise, I know you feel it within' 
 You gon' feel it inside once that bullet hits you dead on arrival nigga 
 Now he killin' for him, careful in disguise ain't no dealin' with sin 
 Your death is your demise, I know you feel it within' 
 You gon' feel it inside once that bullet hits you dead on arrival nigga 
 I know it ain't easy 
 (Hey, hey, yeah)

 I know it gets stressful
