Goin' through 
 Goin' through 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I've been goin' through all these highs and these lows 
 Don't get too close to people homie they come and they go 
 Watch your back when you're 'round 'em 'cause homie you never know 
 These people, people 
 See I just can't get close to people no more 
 I just can't connect with no one like I use to before 
 I know exactly what they usin' me for 
 Lettin' me down 'cause every time they come around 
 They always asking for more 
 Yeah I've been dealin' with the pressure homie 
 They quick to test ya homie 
 People in ya life either a blessing or a lesson homie 
 And all the expectations killin' my vibe 
 Always talkin' bout such and such while they up in my ride 
 Like, so and so fake they two faced and they a snake 
 But I bet you what they seen will probably give 'em a 5 
 And shake they hand, say how you doin' 
 Where you been we should chill 
 And these the same motherfuckers that always say "keep it real" 
 Man I ain't tryna hear that shit 
 These people talking too much and bein' too loud I can't be near that shit 
 Because people never had no loyalty, never had no respect 
 Turn on each other for a check man I don't feel that shit 
 But got the nerve to ask why I don't come around no more 
 Honestly dog I can't fuck with these clowns no more 
 If it ain't' uplifting my people or putting food on my mama's plate 
 I ain't got time to waste I can't be down no more 
 'Cause I've been 
 I've been goin' through all these highs and these lows 
 Don't get too close to people homie they come and they go 
 Watch your back when you're 'round 'em 'cause homie you never know 
 These people, people
