We came a long way from sleeping on the floor and eating scraps 
 Girls paid no attention till they see me rapped 
 Funny, niggas claimin' murder but they never seen a strap 
 Tryin' to take my style, but it's cool I never need it back 
 I always got some new shit 
 Plus you know it's raw off my manager scooped it and produced it 
 Yo, I'm tough and ruthless 
 Niggas talkin' hard, over and out but never do shit 
 Only took me two hands, y'all prolly sucked a few dicks 
 Rock a show until security tell us we gotta go 
 Bet the place is empty the second we step out the door 
 Outside the venue showin' everybody who got the flow 
 I know some cats that got a lot of dough but they ain't got no soul 
 In other words, they worthless 
 Tough over a microphone but hide behind the curtains 
 Love my life but death is the only thing that's certain 
 Back in the days, I love the pump slow when I was taggin' them trains 
 Still ridin' with the same scene, hip-hop for life 
 Holly motherfuck the mainstream, money won't ever change me 
 I'm still at my moms with my homies sippin' fortys 
 Consider yourself lucky if you rock the mic before me 
 I don't fuck with most of the other cats, a different story 
 And you can hate me but you can't ignore me, motherfucker 
 I'm led to show mercy to the enemy, even to wicked men 
 We don't kill, that is our rule 
 You may go now 
 Lord have mercy on the man who rocks the stage after us 
 They ask if we're gonna stay the same, that's a must 
 We started from the bottom, and we still here 
 I said we do this shit for fun, motherfuck a career 
 I worked all my life for this 
 You can't tell me to give up no matter what you say 
 When facing your enemy you have to aim for his weakest point 
 You thought you were unbeatable, how's it feel to lose? 
 We came a long way from in back of them cop cars 
 Tryin' to tell them judges that them drugs are not ours 
 They claim to be thuggin', I'm just tough as Scott's Guard 
 Try to say my name and they all got brushed off 
 Tough love, all you bitches can fuck off 
 Get rolled up quicker than the spliff that you puff on 
 I'm so long, that's the liquor you cuff on 
 I see the bigger picture like I'm sittin' in front row 
 Hold on, shit I could do this the whole song 
 We cookin' in the kitchen from the minute the stove's on 
 They look a little different, not your regular homegrown 
 Menace to society, the Mexican old dog 
 They complainin' that the game gon' changed but that's life, motherfucker 
 No pain, no gain 
 Watch your ice, motherfucker, might yank your chain 
 Tired of these lame ass, same-old-sames 
 Why do we always have to fight each other? 
 No more talk, I'm gonna beat you. 
 Lord have mercy on the man who rocks the stage after us 
 They ask if we're gonna stay the same, that's a must 
 We started from the bottom, and we still here 
 I said we do this shit for fun, motherfuck a career
