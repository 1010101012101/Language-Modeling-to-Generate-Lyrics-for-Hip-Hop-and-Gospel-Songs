Yo, there's nothin' like a smart woman that can hold a conversation 
 Knows how to act in public, knows how to be patient 
 And tells you to wait before you get up in her pants 
 I understand and see beneath the titties and the ass 
 I'm tryin' to get to know you, all them lames is tryin' to hit it 
 They always in a rush, I like to take my time with it 
 And just coast, see what this leads to 
 And when you free, let me know when I can see you 
 I know you got shit to handle and I respect that 
 Independent woman on the grind, tryin' to get that 
 We all got setbacks, let me know if you need somethin' 
 She in school, she tryin' to be somethin' 
 She got her head in the books 
 All that drama, she ain't into that 
 All the chicks got they head in they ass or a nigga's lap 
 And she ain't got no homegirls, they all shady 
 It's a difference in a bitch and a lady 
 You feel me? 
 And she ain't got no homegirls, they all shady 
 It's a difference in a bitch and a lady, in a bitch and a lady 
 See most chicks out there 
 Just lookin' for the next man to pay they rent and they bills 
 They tell you they love you, but they don't know how love feels 
 They don't know what it means, they don't know what it's worth 
 That's why you need to learn to separate the real from the fake 
 And the fake from the real 
 There's a lot of things that folks don't know in this world 
 And one of them's the difference between a hoe, and a girl. 
 And I ain't never met a beauty like you 
 Other girls couldn't come close, even if they tried to 
 See, if it was up to me, I wouldn't let you go 
 The choice is yours, or if you wanna stay, just let me know 
 And yo, we can have a little fun if you want to 
 We can take a little ride if you want to 
 Yeah, and we can play 21 Questions 
 I'll tell you anything, just don't ask about my exes 
 Let's leave the past behind, never go back in time 
 Just tell me where you want to go, put your hand in mine 
 Yeah, and just close your eyes and listen 
 Let me show you everything that you been missing 
 Even though, nobody's perfect, you come the closest to it 
 And if you tell me you down with me, I'mma hold you to it 
 And there's nothing like the way that she sings 
 Too bad she only exists in my dreams.
