I got my game from the man who lived his life on the block 
 Gave me some advice so I listened when he talked he said 
 "Keep living you life 'cause time never stops one day we all go 
 Whether you like it or not". he told me I ain't tryna live this 
 Way no more but I guess it's too late 
 Ain't seen nobody smile at me in so long 
 Till I seen your face, and my eyes no longer have tears, mouth no longer has 
 Taste, my heart no longer has love, but my soul is still in the right place 
 My eyes no longer have tears, mouth no longer has taste 
 Heart no longer has love 
 But my soul is still in in the right place 
 And that's all that matters 
 I could see the pain inside the eyes of a killer 
 Never show my feelings put them to the side 
 And conceal them, they tryna kill us 
 I'll never run the darkness 'cause I see peace in the 
 Furious, love in the heartless 
 Time is moving so fast I been on my own path 
 Shout out to the cats just hoping this last line of coke lasts 
 I don't condone but yo' I feel you pain 
 It's like we ain't got shit to lose but ain't got shit to gain 
 It's the same every second, every day of the month 
 Hooker in the corner tryna feed a baby for once 
 Money is the root of all evil, but everybody needs it 
 Know some cats who kill for it 
 Know some who wouldn't keep it 
 Know some cats to give half to the church and thank Jesus 
 And for the right amount I know some girls you can sleep with 
 Baby I got my game from the man who lived his life on the block 
 Gave me some advice so I listened when he talked he said 
 "Keep living you life 'cause time never stops one day we all go 
 Whether you like it or not". he told me I ain't tryna live this 
 Way no more but I guess it's too late 
 Ain't seen nobody smile at me in so long 
 Till I seen your face, and my eyes no longer have tears, mouth no longer has 
 Taste, my heart no longer has love, but my soul is still in the right place 
 My eyes no longer have tears, mouth no longer has taste, 
 Heart no longer has love no 
 But my soul is still in in the right place 
 That's all that matters 
 Often misunderstood probably 'cause they can't relate to me 
 Seen so many faces they starting to look the same to me 
 Friendships break apart, girlfriends turn to exes 
 Life is a test but I'm still learning my lesson 
 Never the less it's kinda stressful when niggas out to get you 
 And all you trying to do is to show the world you got potential 
 But no one gives a fuck about the struggles you been through unless 
 You handing them money and it's not coincidental 
 When you at the bottom you get left in the dust 
 Don't put your hand out 'cause ain't nobody helping you up 
 I got 2 feet one choice and no other options 
 And when you at the bottom you can still see where the top is
