I'm not wanted 
 But at least I'm still breathin' 
 You ain't heard of me mothafucka 
 You sleeping 
 I'll be here till I'm dead 
 I ain't leaving 
 So you better get use to me 
 Yo before I take my last breath 
 I wanna make it clear I give my all ill never half step 
 And I don't dwell What I can't get 
 Instead I put my time and effort into everything I have left 
 I want the dream that's why I can't rest 
 Shit I just wanna live my life I never hope on any man's death 
 I know they want me dead and I don't blame 'em nigga 
 'Cause am the only rapper fighting for a change my nigga 
 And I ain't bragging I'm just being honest 
 I'm seeking knowledge everybody else is rapping for the fame nigga 
 I do it for the love strictly for the L.O.V.E 
 I try to stay above everything they yell on TV 
 'Cause they just got us killin' each other 
 And the fiends never think twice they quick to steal from they motha 
 Please don't try to put me down if you ain't feeling me brotha 
 Nah make yo own moves, I don't play by no rules 
 No dude coulda last a fuckin' day in my shoes 
 Just like I couldn't pass the 11th grade in high school nigga 
 Fuck what you heard unless you heard it from me 
 'Cause honestly I give a fuck about the word on the streets 
 Mothafuckas got it twisted all up in a nigga's business 
 Speakin' on some shit that ain't even concerning you g 
 Look it's all good though, we all know you hood bro 
 But when you die is anyone gonna know what you stood for 
 Now a days niggas die for the G code 
 That's the very thing that's killin' me and my people 
 It ain't politics it's not Obama 
 It's niggas like you starting problems causin' drama 
 Claiming the streets that you don't even know 
 Willing to die for nigga that wouldn't throw you a bone 
 And you wonder why you stuck on yeah am sellin' drugs 
 'Cause all you wanna do is fuck hoes and be a thug 
 On some real shit I ain't even tryna diss 
 'Cause what I wrote goes out to most of the Cats that I kick it with 
 Ain't tryna put you down but I ain't sugar coating shit 
 Watch for the girls you fuck, watch who you rolling with 
 I'm trying guide you from the darkness to the sunshine 
 We all gotta go some times 
 As I take my last breath
