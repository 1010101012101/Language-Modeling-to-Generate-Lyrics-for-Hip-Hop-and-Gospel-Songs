C-a-l-i-forn-i-a 
 I don't know where the fuck you've been 
 If you don't know my name 
 Phora tag on the wall so they know I came 
 I ain't got no sleep for the past four-five days 
 But I'm still asking around what's poppin' tonight 
 And my boys said he's trying to paint a spot but I might 
 Go and kick it with my girl I always end up in some trouble G 
 But if you need some weed, hit my nigga Double G 
 Wanna see how the west rolls, then come with me 
 In the Benz bumpin' I got love and we drunk 
 Bumpin' G fuck, 90 miles an hour over speed bumps 
 Yellin' rest in peace Nate D-O-Double G 
 I'm bringing the funk back, the west was never dead 
 We were just having too much fun jack 
 I'm from that, sunny C-A and you must admit 
 We're getting down aren't we 
 If you're from the west, bump this at your house party nigga 
 Sunny California, Dime pieces and bomb bud 
 Throw yo fuckin' dubs up, West Coast, West Coast 
 California, Dime pieces and bomb bud 
 Throw yo fuckin' dubs up, West Coast, West Coast 
 Ain't nothing like that California weather 
 Summer breeze and palm trees, nothing feels better 
 Than the sand between your toes, and the mist from the ocean 
 Chillin' at the beach with a dime piece smokin' on a fattie 
 Yeah she calls me Papi not Daddy, Oh how I love these women 
 You meet in Cali, from the dark skin beauties to the thick Latinas 
 Crazy white girls, can't forget y'all neither 
 The only radio station I bump is K-DAY, 93.5 on the 1-0-1 freeway 
 With the windows down, my CD spinning 
 Catch me in your town you gonna see me grinnin' 
 'Cause I'm loving life and I ain't got no time for a hater 
 I'm just on the grind for some paper 
 West Coast tatted on my wrist, and if you got the outline of Cali 
 Tatted you the shit, cruisin' downtown under city lights 
 We rock chucks and white tees nigga get it right 
 Barbeques and Laker games, we just living life 
 But them beautiful Cali days can turn to wicked nights 
 So watch your back nigga 
 Sunny California, Dime pieces and bomb bud 
 Throw yo fuckin' dubs up, West Coast, West Coast 
 California, Dime pieces and bomb bud 
 Throw yo fuckin' dubs up, West Coast, West Coast 
 Look I say West, West (West, West) 
 Say West, West (West, West) 
 Say Calif-orn-i-a (Calif-orn-i-a) 
 Calif-orn-i-a (Calif-orn-i-a) 
 Say West Coast (West Coast) 
 West Coast (West Coast) 
 Now say Sunny C-A (Sunny C-A) 
 Sunny C-A (Sunny C-A) 
 7-1-4 to the 5-62 
 8-1-8 always show love when I slide through 
 3-2-3 to the 6-2-6 y'all know how to get down 
 To that West Coast shit 
 2-1-3 to 9-0-9, throw them fuckin' dubs up when I roll by 
 6-1-9 to the 7-6-0, put that bitch in cruise control 
 And let it just roll, aye aye, let it just roll 
 Put that bitch in cruise control and let it just roll 
 Aye look, let it just roll, put that bitch 
 In cruise control and let it just roll 
 Yeah, let it just roll 
 Aye, let that bitch roll 
 Just let it roll, just let it roll 
 Sunny California is my home nigga
