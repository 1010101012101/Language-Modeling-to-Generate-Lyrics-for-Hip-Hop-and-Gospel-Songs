My eyes are only for you 
 Say I just wish that you knew 
 After all that we've been through 
 I just wish you knew 
 She never had a thing for the diamond rings clothes and designer jeans 
 The thing that she truly wanted in life was a god to see 
 The woman that she truly was 
 And understand the pain 
 Can't really love the sun 
 If you've never been through the rain 
 All she really wanted was somebody to care 
 Given all your love to a person 
 But they not really there 
 That can take a toll long 
 You will make you feel like 
 You're worthless 
 Nobody sees down inside 
 All they really see is the surface 
 But beneath that pretty smile 
 That she had when she spoke 
 Was a quiet pain and darkness 
 From her heart that was broke 
 Sometimes she gets lost 
 Lost in her memories like a dream 
 But all of it was so perfect 
 And nothing came in between 
 The love they showed each other for years 
 But as time passed on 
 All those smiles eventually turned to tears 
 She said all I feel now 
 Is this emptiness that's inside of me 
 They always tell me to be strong 
 And I try to be but 
 My eyes are only for you 
 See I just wish that you knew 
 After all that we've been through 
 I just wish you knew 
 She said 
 Feel like the very day you left me 
 Is when my heart stopped beating 
 And I stopped breathing 
 I know I wasn't perfect 
 But I got my reasons 
 And you got yours 
 Just wish I had more 
 One time to just make this right 
 Before you walk out the door 
 Know we had our ups and downs 
 But I'll never love no one after you 
 I'll never move on 
 But I'mma do what I have to do 
 You were the world, 
 You were my first and my only 
 My eyes are only for you 
 I just wish you would show me 
 Show me your heart 
 Show me your love 
 Show me you care 
 Tell me its fine 
 Tell me you here 
 Say you ain't scared 
 'Cause if I only had one wish 
 I wish we can just talk 'bout the things we love in life 
 Instead we scream and we fight 
 Should have never let you leave 
 We said these things 
 That we probably didn't mean 
 I dreamed of going back 
 And making you stop 
 Took each other for granted 
 I'll forever regret it 
 But one day I'll get to see you in heaven 
 My eyes are only for you 
 See I just wish that you knew 
 After all that we've been through 
 I just wish you knew 
 Wish you knew
