She said she couldn't stay too late 
 She gotta be home by ten she had school the next day 
 She wasn't the type to play she ain't like them other chicks 
 She ain't known for getting drunk, poppin' pills, or sucking dick 
 More like the type to show up to class an hour early 
 Never wearing shorts that's showing her ass 
 Gotta hold on her past she can't let go of it 
 She don't really smile but nobody ever notices 
 Grade A student all her teachers love her 
 She just wishes she felt that same love from her mother 
 But she's stuck in county jail for eighteen months 
 So it's just her and pops and every day he's drunk 
 They hardly talk so when she gets to the house 
 She goes straight to her room and shuts the lights out 
 Hoping the next day comes sooner than later 
 She can't wait to move out four hundred dollars saved up 
 She knows she has a long way to go but she keeps her head so high 
 You'll probably never know what she had to go through for so long 
 (Oh) but she never forgets to hold on she said: 
 If you knew my secret I wonder what you'd say, 
 I wonder if you'd leave and I wonder if you'd stay, 
 I wounded if you'd see me in a different way (see me in a different way) 
 I think about it everyday. 
 She met a kid named Joey knew he had a crush 
 Always made her laugh and said things to make her blush 
 But she tried to pay him no attention 
 Scared her past would eventually ruin the friendship 
 'Cause it's so hard for her to open her feelings 
 He said 'if you don't give me your heart beautiful I'mma steal it' 
 So twelve months passed and ever since 
 He said that she been in love but every body has their setbacks 
 She wrote on paper sayin' "I'm sorry 
 I just wish you knew your the reason that my heart beats 
 Always made me smile ever since the day you saw me 
 You were my guardian angel when I had nobody 
 But there's something I haven't told you for six years 
 There was something that I had to go through 
 That shattered my spirit and my dreams, I know you can see it 
 My father did these things to me and no one believed it 
 My mom was never there to see I hope when she reads this 
 She OD's on the very thing that broke us to pieces 
 You were the only person that I ever loved 
 And it kills me inside to know that I was the one 
 To ruin what we had and I knew this would happen 
 I just thought me and you would have lasted" 
 Knife to her rise then she dropped to the floor 
 But right before she cut she heard a knock at the door. 
 She said: if you knew my secret I wounded what you'd say 
 I wonder if you'd leave and I wonder if you'd stay 
 I wounder if you'd see me in a different way (see me in a different way) 
 I think about it everyday
