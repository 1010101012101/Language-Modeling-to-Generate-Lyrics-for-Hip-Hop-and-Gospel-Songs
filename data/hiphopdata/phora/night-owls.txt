Where all my smokers at? 
 Light one up and take a hit 
 Inhale the smoke and before you blow it out 
 Just know that you the shit 
 Just know you got yourself back up 
 Each time you fell, every time you slipped 
 'Cause all I know is this, the only way you fail is if you quit 
 So fuck your fancy cars, 'cause dawg we dying out here 
 We just sheep in a pack of fucking wolves and lions out here 
 And the system got us fucked up and the media still lying out here 
 It's like we was born without a chance, but we still trying out here 
 I'm back home again, back up in my zone again 
 This music's all I got, these feelings inside, I just can't hold 'em in 
 So I'm back in the motherfucking lab with a pen and a pad 
 And my niggas, they feeling it 
 All my niggas is smokers dawg 
 I'm just high 'cause the room is filled with it 
 I'm feeling it, up on cloud 9 like I'm too real to quit 
 Mama raised a fucking man so all this pain, nigga I'm built for this 
 Yours truly taking over, you don't like it? You gon deal with it 
 Anthro beats is killing it, Eskupe man he's killing it 
 This industry's filled with pricks that tell kids to go pop pills in this 
 So hard to knot your anger when your entire heart's been filled with it 
 No mercy for the ones that called our sons niggas and childrens spicks 
 Fuck your code of silence, 'cause for way too long I've sealed my lips 
 I killed for you, killed for moms, I killed for the crew, I killed for this 
 Don't make me catch a body, I ain't devour 
 I will fill a clip and pull the trigger so motherfucking quick 
 That you won't hear the click 
 And take your team out one by one till no one knows you still exist 
 Tell these haters I said fuck 'em, tell Fox News I said fuck 'em 
 My whole fucking city got my back, ain't backing down for nothing 
 Bitch I'm coming, yeah bitch I'm coming
