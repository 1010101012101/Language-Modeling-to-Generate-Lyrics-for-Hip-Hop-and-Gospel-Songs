I got two dollars in my pocket for the bus ride home 
 For the bus ride home, for the bus ride home 
 I guess I'm on my own, yeah 
 I hope I make it home safe 
 I hope I make it home safe 
 I hope I make it home safe 
 My friends are enemies in disguise 
 Y'all gonna switch up, it's just a matter of time 
 Seems like the life I used to live is just passing me by 
 I wanna know some answers Lord, I'm just asking you why 
 Why you gotta take the lives of innocent kids and watch their families suffer? 
 There's people under the bridge asleep without eatin' supper 
 Plus it's gettin' crazy 'round where I stay 
 Nowadays it ain't safe 'cause these niggas don't play 
 Two kids from the east side had a high speed chase with the cops 
 Right off of Malverne is where they got caught 
 Runnin' from murder, they ain't stoppin' so they let off some shots 
 One of them dead at the fatal cost of reppin' the block 
 The other one locked away for good for taking a life 
 Everything has a cost and you'll be paying the price 
 When you put numbers on a nigga's head it ain't gon' be worth it 
 Karma comes back like a receipt after you makin' that purchase 
 Waitin' for the bus, hope I get home without gettin' jacked 
 Past tense, the gangstas are rollin' 'round with a strap 
 Look, and I just pray to God that they leave me alone 
 'Cause all I got is two dollars, I'm just tryin' to get home 
 'Cause it happened to my boy and they said empty your pockets 
 Took his phone, gun to his head, started checkin' his wallet 
 Padded him down, took everything he had in his jeans 
 I'm glad he's alive, I just hope it doesn't happen to me 
 You don't know whether or not they're gonna pull on that trigger 
 Just to prove to his niggas from the hood that he's with it 
 Takin' another person's life just so he can earn some stripes 
 Jackin' old ladies now, it makes me toss and turn at night 
 It ain't right if you think jackin' fools is cool 
 I'mma let you know now, it's gonna catch up to you soon 
 Pullin' straps on people thinkin' everything's fine 
 'Til you get caught and you cry to the judge givin' you time 
 And I'm just speakin' my mind and I don't care if you disagree 
 I'm just sick of seein' kids get jacked and killed in my city, G 
 I got two dollars in my pocket for the bus ride home 
 For the bus ride home, for the bus ride home 
 I guess I'm on my own, yeah 
 I hope I make it home safe 
 I hope I make it home safe 
 I hope I make it home safe 
 My friends are enemies in disguise 
 Y'all gonna switch up, it's just a matter of time 
 Seems like the life I used to live is just passing me by 
 I wanna know some answers Lord, I'm just asking you why 
 Why you gotta take the lives of innocent kids, watch their families suffer? 
 There's people under the bridge asleep without eatin' supper now
