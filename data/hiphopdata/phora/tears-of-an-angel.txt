We all make mistakes 
 Head high, wipe them tears off your face 
 Nobody ever notice you, yeah. 
 I know it gets rough, yeah, but we all make mistakes 
 Keep your head high, wipe them tears off your face 
 You need someone but nobody ever notice you 
 Just remember you got angels watchin' over you. 
 I know times are gettin' hard and it's tough to handle 
 But no matter what, promise you'll keep your head high 
 'Cause I'd hate to lose another friend 
 This world's a battle and I shed blood, sweat, and tears just to get by 
 My only weakness is havin' a heart 
 And if I could change the world I wouldn't know where to start 
 But if you truly want change you gotta start with yourself 
 So I'm workin on my flaws and I ain't nobody else 
 But me and we all change when we get older 
 Call me what you want, beauty's in the eyes of the beholder 
 Angels watchin' over, hah, bless my soul 
 Remember when I first told ya, "Friends turn foes." 
 One was standin' right next to me 
 Who would have known? 
 Shit, I love life but it's a bitch I just can't cope with 
 But I hope this helps you understand me 
 And if I never get the chance to win a Grammy 
 My mom will still love me, and so will my grammy 
 And so will the rest of my fans and most of my family 
 And yo, that's way more than I would ever ask 
 Good times are on the way, bad times, just let 'em pass 
 And I promise when I leave you'll never be alone 
 Angels watchin' over you when I'm gone 
 And I promise when I leave you'll never be alone 
 Angels watchin' over you when I'm gone. 
 I know it gets rough, yeah, but we all make mistakes 
 Keep your head high, wipe them tears off your face 
 You need someone but nobody ever notice you 
 Just remember you got angels watchin' over you 
 Yeah, we all make mistakes 
 Head high, wipe them tears off your face 
 Nobody ever notice you, you got angels watchin' over you 
 So get a grip and wipe them tears off your face 
 And promise yourself that you'll never lose faith 
 And when they tell you that this world don't have a place for you 
 I know a place that I can take you to 
 And I wonder, sometimes I wonder if they'll ever realize 
 When they look at me, they look into my people's eyes 
 I'm the voice of the children who never got to speak 
 And I'll never be silent so either talk to me or walk away 
 But whatever choice you chose to make, you'll have to live with forever 
 Go on and choose your fate 
 Child of the future, I'm here to make a difference 
 I could save a life and all you have to do is listen 
 Raised by the angels, my mother was sent from heaven 
 And even though life is rough, I cherish every second 
 And it's a blessing to know that when I go to sleep 
 I have an angel watchin' over me 
 And it's a blessing to know that when I go to sleep 
 I have an angel watchin' over me 
 I know it gets rough, yeah, but we all make mistakes 
 Keep your head high, wipe them tears off your face 
 You need someone but nobody ever notice you 
 Just remember you got angels watchin' over you 
 Yeah, we all make mistakes 
 Head high, wipe them tears off your face 
 Nobody ever notice you, you got angels watchin' over you 
 Wipe them tears off your face, wipe them tears off your face 
 Wipe them tears off your face.
