I'm surprise I'm still standin' right here 
 I was livin' in a nightmare 
 Never be able to breath again 
 First off 
 I ain't in this for the Dead Presidents 
 The nice whips fly chicks or gold necklaces 
 I do this in hopes that my Auntie gets off of the pipe 
 And the small chance of possibly changing a person's life 
 I wanna make things right 
 These kids need some guidance 
 This generations lullaby is gunshots 'n' sirens 
 I'm here to make a difference fuck the code of the streets 
 I refuse to be a victim to my own self defeat 
 Don't let 'em get you trapped 
 'Cause there's only 2 places that you'll end up 
 N I'm pretty sure you know just where that's at 
 Fuck the fame, fuck the money, fuck gettin' put on the map 
 I'm just tryna come together 
 Brown, white, yellow, black 
 It don't matter what color 
 And before you put that bullet in his head 
 Just make sure you think of his mother 
 And his little sister cryin' when they seem him at his funeral 
 But in the streets I guess that's business as usual 
 And I took so many chances in my life 
 I'm surprise I'm still standing right here 
 I never thought I'll make it yo 
 Just a couple of years ago, I was living in a nightmare 
 Knife in my chest, knife in my back 
 Never thought I'll be able to breath again 
 But now I know I'm here for a reason but 
 I just don't think this muthaf's see it yet 
 I just don't think these muthaf's see it yet 
 I don't write music to convince you to believe in me 
 I write music to convince you to believe in you 
 Stay positive, keep smiling, and one day you'll see 
 Anything is possible and you could make your dreams come true, 
 This is for the Kids that past before they had a chance to live 
 Their memories live on throughout my words 
 And If I had to give my life so you could hold the ones you lost 
 And hear them laugh again, I would do it in a second 
 All I ask is this, when I'm gone remember 
 All I ever wanted was to make a difference 
 Pray my sister graduates, I hate to miss it 
 But if my time comes you won't hear me complain 
 But since we still here let me speak to you 
 So just press play 'n' listen 
 If I ever made a million dollars 
 I'll create a program to help these kids get into college 
 Even though my ass didn't pass the 11th grade 
 Momma is still proud and that's all that matters for heavens sake 
 I let the haters hate, 'cause my family will always love me 
 Nothing left to say, didn't make it here by getting lucky 
 I'm playing by the rule but yo I gotta confess 
 Last night I felt like quitting 'cause all of the stress 
 Got the world on my shoulder 'n' pain all over my chest 
 Plus my girl is tripping, she keeps thinking I'm callin' my ex 
 But somehow, someway, I kept on pushin' 
 Never show my pain 'cause you never know who's lookin' 
 When you show weakness they try to bring you down 
 N talk behind your back and diss you when you're not around 
 But they will never stop me 
 I'mma change the world 
 Don't believe me 
 Just Watch me 
 Hey... 
 And I took so many chances in my life 
 I'm surprise I'm still standing right here 
 I never thought I'll make it yo 
 Just a couple of years ago, I was living in a nightmare 
 Knife in my chest, knife in my back 
 Never thought I'll be able to breath again 
 But now I know I'm here for a reason but 
 I don't think this muthaf's see it yet 
 I just don't think these muthaf's see it yet
