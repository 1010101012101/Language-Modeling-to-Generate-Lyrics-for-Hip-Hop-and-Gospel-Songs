Sometimes it seems like, like there ain't nothing left 
 Sometimes I feel like, I'm just wasting my breath 
 Sometimes it seems like, like there ain't nothing left 
 No matter how hard I try I just 
 I can't seem to get away, I can't seem to get away 
 They said I'm just an angel with broken wings 
 And we living just to die, chasing hopeless dreams 
 No matter how hard I try I just 
 I say fuck love, 'cause what's love, when they don't love you back 
 I say fuck love, 'cause what's love, when they don't love you back 
 Yeah I say fuck love, 'cause what's love, when they don't love you back 
 I say fuck love 'cause what's love, what's love... 
 When you can't feel no more 
 Yeah I'm drinking till I can't feel no more 
 Straight out the bottle till I can't feel no pain 
 My heart is hollow dog I can't feel no shame, no shame 
 So don't call my motherfucking phone no more 
 Just leave me alone I can do this shit on my own 
 So don't call my motherfucking phone no more 
 Just leave me alone 
 No matter how hard I try, I just 
 No matter how hard I try, I just 
 They said I'm just an angel with broken wings 
 No matter how hard I try, I just
