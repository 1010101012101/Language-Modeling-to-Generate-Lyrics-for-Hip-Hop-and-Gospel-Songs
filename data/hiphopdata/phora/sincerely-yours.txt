Yeah 
 Well 
 Nas got me on some shit on this one right here man 
 Yours truly 
 Yeah 
 Yeah 
 These are confessions of a sinner 
 I picked a bag and left a letter 'cause my temper seems 
 To get to me some times 
 I get sick of me sometimes 
 Pressure from myself is my biggest enemy sometimes 
 But, I hated myself 'cause of you 
 But now I'm done with that 
 That's why I'm hopin' on this train and never comin' back 
 And I refuse to let anyone in my way 
 I ain't tryna leave you behind, 
 But I just can't stay 
 Yeah I just can't stay 
 Yeah I just can't stay 
 I just can't stay, 
 So will I keep running away 
 Keep running away (keep runnin') 
 I hope you get to read my letter 
 I signed it "Sincerely Yours" 
 You've been hurt too many times 
 I see them tears of yours, 
 Running down your face like Yosemite Falls 
 But if you ever need something 
 Just don't get me involved 
 'Cause I, I gotta move on with my life 
 And we all got a chose 
 We all can speak, but not all of us got a voice 
 So I devote mine to the children of today 
 But how I'm suppose to move on, when you keep begging me to stay 
 Well we must of lost a passion 
 See my mother used to love you 
 Ion what happened 
 Probably 'cause you changed 
 And she don't like the way the come off for 
 I guess the connection just must of cut off 
 Like an unpaid bill to Version 
 Over the hills, horizon 
 The sun is settin' I could feel it inside me 
 That I ain't got nowhere else to go 
 But I keep on pushin' 
 Don't want to leave 
 But I ain't felt this low 
 So I can't (stay) 
 Yeah I just can't stay 
 Yeah I just can't stay 
 Yeah I just can't stay 
 So will I keep runnin' away (keep runnin' away) 
 Yeah 
 See I missed the way we used to be 
 I miss the way you touched my heart 
 Used to be true to me, but 
 Now you let these nigga walk all over you 
 They don't treat your name with respect 
 And they talk right over you 
 Kills me every time I hear it 
 Slowly losing my spirit 
 They sabotaging your beauty, they desecrate your appearance 
 And. They say I'm scared that's why I'm runnin' away 
 I guess they right, 
 'Cause we all know what just might happen to me if I (stay) 
 I wanna leave but I'm lost without you 
 And I can't stand the way these motherfuckers talk about you 
 They say you just care for the 
 Money and jewels, the cars, the clothes, the fame, 
 And the popular dudes, glamorization the money, and livin' in glory 
 It just seems like you forgot about the kids with a story 
 But without you I wouldn't survive one more day 
 You saved my life 
 Dear Hip-Hop, I'll never leave. I'm here to stay!
