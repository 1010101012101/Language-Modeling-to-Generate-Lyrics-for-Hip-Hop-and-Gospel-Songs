A yo this life is like a dream 
 I just hope that I never wake 
 Made mistakes in the past but I'm trying to set it straight 
 Been through hell and back, hope they accept at Heaven's gates 
 Sell my soul for a mill that's a deal that I'll never take 
 And I'll never break under pressure 
 I realized how fortunate my life has been 
 So I'm always giving back to the lesser 
 I'm blessed but the devil's been following on my footsteps 
 Surprised my life ain't been took yet 
 Misunderstood? Yes! 
 Ask me to explain there's not enough time 
 To show you all the thoughts that I got locked in my mind 
 Listen my heart is as solid as Optimus Prime 
 And my voice is almost as painful as Pac's in his prime 
 And the day I pass away is when the stars will align 
 And the planets collide I see the light screamin' God save my life 
 From the violence I'm just fighting the eyes like a lion 
 Yo I fight for my pride that's my people not my ego 
 Like a eagle, visions far as the skies 
 Like a eagle, visions far as the skies 
 They tell me that's the limit 
 But folks already made it to the moon 
 So I'll never stop reachin' till the day I'm in tomb 
 And when you at my funeral dressed in all white 
 Pour some liquor out for me smoke session all night 
 'Cause it's only right I'll be happy to see the light 
 No need to mourn my death just celebrate my life, look. 
 I'm having trouble catching my breath 
 Having trouble seeing clearly I've been laughing at death 
 Surrounded by wolves, snakes and the vultures 
 Waiting the ultra we dying out and there's no hope in saving the culture 
 But before it's over it's all gonna hit you 
 'Cause you're just sitting on your ass instead of solving your issues 
 All these niggas want your neck and yeah they all gonna' get you 
 We gon' see how far that motherfuckin' talking will get you 
 Homies I had to learn the hard way almost lost my life 
 Walking down Euclid St. and Broadway wrong time wrong place 
 Just thanking God one of them bullets didn't touch me but 
 I had a couple friends in my life that ain't get so lucky 
 'Cause 7 month later R2 from S.T.L 
 Got stuck outside of school and he died at the age of 12 
 Usually I don't wish pain on a person 
 But I hope the motherfucker who did it rots in a fucking cell! 
 12 years with so many more to go why'd they have to do it 
 We probably won't ever know it's a never ending cycle 
 Been trying not to lose my faith gripping on the Bible 
 It's like death is right behind you but you keep movin' forward 
 You trying to get away but it just keeps getting closer 
 But you fight another day never give up see that's the meaning of life 
 And even when you're down there's always a reason to fight 
 I said never give up that's the meaning of life 
 And even when you're down there's always a reason to fight 
 And even when you in the darkness yo just think of the light 
 And just make sure they know my name if I stop breathing tonight 
 Yours truly
