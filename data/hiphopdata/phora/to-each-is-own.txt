They say they hate the new me, but I'mma do me 
 'Cause I ain't got time to be focused on you 
 Never took a handout, did this shit my damn self 
 I've been working hard and you should too

 Yo... Look... 
 All my old friends told me that I've change 
 All of these new kids around me for the fame 
 But time will tell between real or fake and I'll have to see 
 'Cause yo the only cat that always had my back was me 
 And sometimes it's even hard to trust my damn self 
 All these people wanna do me favors but they can't help 
 Can't find the solution if you don't know what the problem is 
 Guess that's why I really never cave into no politics 
 Many say they love me but very few mean it 
 I would say I love 'em too but I don't know the meaning 
 I try to understand but I don't get the concept 
 Guess I'm still a kid that just don't know what he wants yet

 I never blamed another person for any mistake I ever made 
 I take the lost I learn from it and hope for better days 
 Y'all go through up's and down's I'm aiming for heavens gate 
 And I ain't playing playa I know the game I ain't getting played 
 Unless it's on Rapies and Rhymes and I ain't with that bullshit 
 So homie save me the time 
 I'll handle my own don't do me no favors that's fine 
 I heard you want to catch me slippin' homie wait in the line 
 Cats is talking hard over twitter y'all playin' hide and seek 
 Always got my name in yo mouth but that's what I like to see 
 Yeah I hear 'em saying Phora this and Phora that 
 But it's gonna take more than a knife and some words to hold me back 
 Never carry strap that ain't the way I roll brah 
 I don't live in fear but I still look over my shoulder 
 Paranoia is one hell of a cloud to live with 
 It's with you everywhere you go there's no way out this shit 
 But honestly that's not why I'm never around to kick it 
 I'd just rather make some money and get down to business 
 And I doubt that you'll listen to me if I tried to explain 
 I do this shit for y'all not for the fame 
 They say they hate the new me, but I'mma do me 
 'Cause I ain't got time to be focused on you 
 Never took a handout, did this shit my damn self 
 I've been working hard and you should too
