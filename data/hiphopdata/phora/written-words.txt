Drop a couple tears over these written words 
 Destined for greatness ever since the day I was given birth 
 Born with a curse but I'm just tryna convince the earth 
 Every time I did something wrong I had no intent to hurt 
 I spit the words of crown men 
 Walk with my head high, to your town's end 
 Came to preach the heart of thousands 
 Here's the announcement, Phora's in the house 
 Everybody circles around him 
 Speakin' with the depth of the sea, height of a mountain 
 And they doubt it until they realize his vision was the truest 
 Realize no indvidual could do this 
 Gimme a pen and I'mma use it in a fashion 
 And nobody else can fool with 
 Making more than music is a mothafuckin' movement 
 Pullin' nothin' but the truest leavin' mothafuckas clueless 
 So let's knuckle up and do this 
 All the kids that hate me need to cuddle up and group kiss 
 They said I'll never make it so I'll struggle just to prove it 
 Friends turn foes, foes turn jealous 
 It's hard to show my love 'cause growin' up I never felt it 
 Misery loves company, so darling take my hand 
 Please come with me 
 Friends turn foes, foes turn jealous 
 It's hard to show my love 'cause growin' up I never felt it 
 Misery loves company, so darling take my hand 
 Please come with me 
 Keep your enemies the closest 
 The thing is if they were but I was too blind to notice 
 Tryna send a message give a fuck about the show biz 
 My father use to give the cold shoulder to his own kids 
 That's probably why I'm so upset they tryna make me go to rest 
 But you'll never see me sleep 'cause it's too close to death 
 Coke n' meth in my father's bloodstream when he made me 
 Born in '94 just another crack baby 
 From another black lady and my motha can't tame me 
 No father figure so you fuckas can't blame me 
 Learn to get used to it, ain't that crazy? 
 The street lights and the train tracks raised me nigga 
 Friends turn foes, foes turn jealous 
 It's hard to show my love 'cause growin' up I never felt it 
 Misery loves company, so darling take my hand 
 Please come with me 
 Friends turn foes, foes turn jealous 
 It's hard to show my love 'cause growin' up I never felt it 
 Misery loves company, so darling take my hand 
 Please come with me
