I know this girl 
 Dark skin, beautiful smile 
 Used to be close, but we ain't spoke in a while 
 I hope she doing good, lord knows she's on my mind 
 I'm just hoping she think of me from time to time 
 But yeah, I know you busy 
 Out doing your thing 
 And I guess we haven't talked 'cause I'm out doing the same 
 Heard you got a new man that thinks he from the hood and shit 
 But if you ask me, I think you too good for him 
 And I ain't jealous I'm just speaking my thoughts 
 And by the way, did you speak to your mom? 
 She said you got arrested at the park 'cause you was underage drinking 
 And your friends was smoking glass, what the fuck are they thinking? 
 I heard you coming home drunk like every weekend 
 You tryna to run from something, but that something ain't leaving 
 I just wish I knew what it was, so I can change it 
 Not for you, but for us 
 So we could build a better relationship 
 And yeah I know I've changed a bit 
 But You the only women that I can't forget 
 Every time I see you, I wanna hug you and squeeze you 
 And even though we be distant I hope you know that I need you... in my life 
 'Cause nobody else can compare to you 
 And I wish I could explain how much I care for you 
 And lately I know you been going through a lot 
 But I'm only a call away if you ever need a talk 
 I can tell by the make up on your face that you getting older 
 Life's getting shorter, the worlds getting colder 
 You stubborn like me you just wanna seek your own faith 
 But yo momma can't sleep 'cause you coming home late 
 And you stress me out to where I worry about you girl 
 'Cause In a blink of an eye they can take you out the world 
 God forbid, but you an angel. I can see you glow 
 You just gotta give it some time for your wings to grow 
 I love you, I just wanna see the best for you 
 So keep your head up and don't let nobody get to you 
 Me and you been through so much you like my best friend 
 I guess we don't get along 'cause we both nuts 
 But if anybody fuck wit you, and I happen to run into em 
 Best believe they'll get their fucking throat cut 
 I ain't even the type of person to start shit 
 But I can feel your pain when you go through those hardships 
 'Cause your pain is my pain 
 Every time I hear you doing bad, I seem to get these migraines 
 I think we got the same mindframe and I swear on everything 
 I love your blood running through my veins 
 And I swear on everything I love your blood runnin' through my veins 
 I think I'll call you today and settle our differences 
 Lord knows I love my lil sis
