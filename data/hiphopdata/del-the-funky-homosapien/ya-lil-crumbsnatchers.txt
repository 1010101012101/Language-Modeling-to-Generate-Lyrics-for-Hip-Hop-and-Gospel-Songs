DEL made a pact to be well natural 
 Back from the wishing well to sell actual 
 Funk from the fungus grown in the trench 
 It's getting kinda heavy so I gotta pinch an inch 
 And it's a snitch 
 To let my hair grow like a plant 
 Eliminate the fat gold chains and the diaper pants 
 Trade 'em for a pair Girbauds 
 Never make friends with the fraudulent foes 
 Yes I suppose that I'm fat from the supper 
 Skinny from the many that try to eat plenty 
 Now I got to flip on a copper like a penny 
 Vise uh versa, quench your thirst 
 With a swig of grapefruit juice straight from the thermos 
 Hock your jewels, and you can drop your tools 
 And make a move that can turn us in the right direction 
 Show your affection as I correct men 
 Who try to pull the wool over the third eye 
 Comin' fly with Mr. Greenjeans 
 It's a bird eye view of the meadow 
 As I greet the many people that I meet with a hello 
 "How do you do my compadre?", What up Kwame? 
 Back to the Meadow so I can show I'm a 
 Smooth black brother that is gifted 
 And if you try to lift this, yes, I got a witness 
 Nicknamed the Emperor, this wasn't meant for ya' 
 Ya little crumbsnatcher
