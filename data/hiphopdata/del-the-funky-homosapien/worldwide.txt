Del: 
 Who is the two like the Blues Brothers? 
 Unicron: 
 Yeah, who does it? 
 Del: 
 Me and you kid 
 We bruise dozens 
 And hundreds of kids 
 Havin' fun with the wiz 
 That's me and, 
 Unicron: 
 Unicron, the inhuman on the mic 
 Yikes! (Zoinks!) 
 Del: 
 Lazer zaps saps who can't rap 
 They sound like beginners 
 I slam then I pin ya 
 Send ya to the hospital 
 I gots the flow 
 No nigga dare step 
 You'll get your hair swept 
 Off the floor when I clip ya 
 Button ya lip ya 
 Even if the record skips 
 I still rip (Damn that nigga still rips!) 
 Total rivers 
 Equip ya punk posse 
 Ya got lots to see 
 Days to come 
 Before you raise from dumb to smarter 
 Rippin' apart a poser 
 Bend 'em 
 Inside out, like Yoga 
 I'm a nice person on the inside 
 But men hide 
 When you and your friend die 
 But a hand to the strangler 
 The Beni Hanna chopper 
 And we oughtta pop ya 
 And crop ya 
 'Cause we're sick of that shit (Sick of it!) 
 I'm about to have a fit 
 And split ya head 
 And kick ya bitch, in the tits 
 They're tender 
 Mixin' niggas brains like a blender 
 I kick rhymes like these to inja 
 And end ya 
 Off ya 
 Never comin' softer 
 This is not the best I can offer 
 I'ma save some for later 
 You ain't greater 
 Than the man 
 With a plan 
 And the brand that his name 
 And I hate ya. 
 Unicron: 
 I'm the youngsta 
 With the swift tongue, 
 And the kid that lives up the street 
 Over Jon's beat 
 I make rappers eat turds and hay 
 It doesn't matter what version you play 
 I will still slay 
 A crowd a rhymers 
 And Del how'd I find ya? 
 Del: 
 That one summer years ago I shoulda signed ya. 
 Unicron: 
 Just a quick reminder 
 For those who find a 
 Problem with me 
 I'll put you on noid like a T & T timer 
 And there's only 20 seconds 
 Now I'm 16 
 And yes fiend to wreck shit 
 I throw temper tantrums 
 That's my anthem 
 I'm not very big 
 But you phuck with me, you'll be like Jerry's kids 
 Phucked up, & that's tough luck 
 Unicron has never backed down from a tough phuck 
 That's what lubricated Trojans are for 
 'Cause I know, when the corn hits the tip 
 I got the dip 
 Flip and they suckin' on my nipples 
 And I will have a fut, too 
 'Cause I get excited when I ride it 
 Fun while it lasted 
 Cas, did you like 
 When I did a song, back in the day with the Del-a-ray? (That's me!) 
 Get a patna 
 I'm glad you got the chance 
 To enhance the Jive roster 
 I'm a foster kid 
 But Del hooked me 
 Now I look free when I'm out, 
 Del: And I'm out...
