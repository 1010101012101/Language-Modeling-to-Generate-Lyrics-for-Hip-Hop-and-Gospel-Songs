Yeah after the money bought 
 Sidestep your funny talk 
 The bum rush ain't ever gonna stop. 
 Watch that () belly flop 
 Dummies trying to tell me what I should do 
 When they barely comp 
 Enough for their basic needs 
 Trying to hate on me 
 Pump your brakes 'fore I make you bleed 
 My commendation get different denominations for the bread basket 
 This () plastic 
 Or some jet black () 
 Passing you the wild card 
 Anything is possible when I drop a flow. 
 You old style fraud 
 I apply hard pressure 
 To make you foolish dudes fess up. 
 West up fo's down 
 With your old sound 
 Broke with nowhere to go now 
 Rodeo clowns trying to evade the bull 
 After acting like they taking it by the horns. 
 You can't ride the storm. 
 You get launched. 
 Once you hit the ground get stomped. 
 It's a human juice you stupid doofus 
 Having you running like mucus. 
 Pursuit is 
 Swift and challenging 
 Throw off your balancing; 
 Vertigo 
 Hurt your flow. 
 Crown the king. 
 Things can't stay the same 
 They've got to change 
 Get that in your brain. 
 Contestant you're low ranked despite what you think 
 I'm 'bout to break the bank.

 I'm coming for the money bag 
 Punishing your ugly ass 
 Not giving a damn 
 [] At. 
 Call the authorities 
 You are disorderlies. 
 All will be handled accordingly. 
 And who ain't supporting me fine 
 They small time 
 Complain about nickels and dimes. 
 Sit in () 
 Ridiculous to ask 
 While you asenine, 
 The absolute last in line. 
 Nonessential, moron, it's monumental 
 All you got is what your momma get you. 
 But I'm out to break the bank 
 Ain't gonna be nothing left 
 When I take the tank 
 Out for a Sunday cruise 
 Crush and cruise; 
 Flows erupting tubes 
 Busting through 
 Them puss'll ooze. 
 Whoever you entrust it to 
 Get a couple too 
 Just to prove-- 
 Don't interrupt the dude 
 The feud that ensues'll leave you subdued abused. 
 Roll and you lose 
 Come up with a blank, 
 With nothing to thank 
 You better tuck in your chain.
