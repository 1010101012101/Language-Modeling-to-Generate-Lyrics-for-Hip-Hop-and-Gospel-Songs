(After a bunch of P-Funk, Del kicks one verse) 
 I've returned from the meadow with a fellow named X 
 Two turntables and a spark upon his set 
 Wet behind the ears from the tears of my peers 
 Rap is outta control that's what we fear 
 So we collapse any actual threats 
 With the new batch of catchy little quirks 
 And it works like a charm as I bomb and alarm 
 Any listeners 
 Coming through crisper 
 On your transistors 
 So we can eliminate the frauds 
 Filled with pride as the audience applauds 
 Might sound odd to the average Joe Schmoe 
 The new school passed ya ass like Flo Jo 
 Dodo 
 Me and CM-PX both construct 
 Like Kid Creole and the Coconuts 
 As we drop the bomb with a blast 
 And now all the natives ask... 
 (Chorus: "What is a booty and how do I know if I'm shaking it?...)
