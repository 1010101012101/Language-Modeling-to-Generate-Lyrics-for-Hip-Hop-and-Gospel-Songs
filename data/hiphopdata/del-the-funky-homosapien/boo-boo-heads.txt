KURIOUS: (Talking) 
 Oh man. Bitches, man, bitches! Sick and tired a this shit. 
 You know what I'm sayin'? Want my money, talkin' shit, don't know 
 How to act, phuckin' tired, man. FPhuck'm I gonna do, man? Have to put 
 A foot up your ass? Phuckin' tired of it, man. Phuckin' buy you this, 
 Buy you that, Phuck that shit! Kurious ain't havin' it. Know what I'm 
 Sayin'? 
 DEL: 
 Boo boo head, boo boo head, boo boo head 
 I want you dead 
 I want you bled and bleeding 
 Needing medical assistance, resistance 
 Ya kiss meant nothin' 
 You was bluffin' 
 Stuffin' my brain with insane thoughts and notions 
 Most intelligent people freak you 
 Because they'll know 
 You'll give ya all 
 Give up your drawls 
 Flap ya jaws and lyin' 
 And have me cryin' 
 I'll admit it 
 Someone before musta shitted down your neck 
 Boo boo head 
 But can you be dead? 
 With fled 
 Instead of the murda 
 I'll just tell everybody what I heard of 
 Word up. 
 D: All a this over boo boo heads, 
 K: All a this, all a this... 
 Back in elementary school 
 You made me drool 
 I was cool 
 And rules were never broken 
 A token, 
 Of our friendship 
 All my friends flippin' somersaults 
 The fault was not yours 
 Of course, they didn't know, yo 
 Grils was yucky 
 Clear 'round and get slapped like a puck-y 
 But you never said 'Phuck me' 
 That wasn't in the pictua 
 I couldn't hit ya with ya hair and braids 
 And the games we played 
 Were fun 
 Till one day a friend said, 
 'Boo boo heads turn red, in the face 
 When you place 
 Ya hands on her ass 
 In class, and give a spank 
 A banka full of fun 
 At recess, and be fresh.' 
 OK, I'll try it 
 And die if she does 
 But she did 
 And turned around and socked me like Rocky 
 I feel like a heel for real 
 But now I'm older 
 And told ya to keel over 
 Cause now it's different 
 No innocence 
 And women sprints the way 
 You sway to the forces of evil 
 And we will bust that ass fast and quickly 
 I dig G's 
 Disrespectin' rep 
 Now it's when they shit's come bobbin' brothers 
 Try and rob another 
 And I'll rub ya the wrong way 
 Let the song play, 
 Ooh, I wanna smack you 
 Mack you and attack you 
 Even if you black you get no slack 
 Sue, 
 Call a lawyer 
 Boy, ya never knew 
 Ya crew is on a mission 
 Every weekend 
 Freakin' and kissin' 
 With other van ya man 
 Lets turn the sands in the hourglass 
 And your power lasts less and guess 
 And take a gander 
 I slander ya name and spread propaganda 
 And I demand ya ta stop 
 Hop on a train before pain'll 
 Be ya middle name 
 In the game of love and happiness 
 Yes, I caressed ya flesh 
 But if you test 
 Ya caught out there without a vest 
 Mess around and you can rest 
 I found a new boo boo 
 Baby, maybe I can crave the 
 One that saves thee 
 Reputation, y'all lets face it 
 Ya basin' 
 Smokin', leavin' niggas broken 
 And open 
 But I scope in to ya brain 
 Gain and remain and clues ya use for protection 
 Now who's next in...
