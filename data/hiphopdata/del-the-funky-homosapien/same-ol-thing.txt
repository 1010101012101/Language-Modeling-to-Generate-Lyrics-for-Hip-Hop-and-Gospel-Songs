(Chrous:) 
 "The same ol' thing (all over the world), 
 The same ol' thing (got to get 'em wit it), 
 The same ol' thing (MCs out there got), 
 The same ol' thing (so let me tell ya 'bout it)," 
 MCs keep comin' with the same ol' thing 
 With the same ol' swing 
 With the same ol' ending 
 The same ol' climax 
 Cause many have no vertebrae 
 Yo, but D-E-L & HIEROGLYPHICS have to murder a 
 Fraudulent foe real quick 
 And get them off of our dicks 
 Show the public that they ass ain't slick 
 They lack skills 
 And they can only thrill ya by dance steps 
 I coulda iced Vanilla, but I haven't got the chance yet 
 But that's ok 
 'Cause he was dissed on Soul Train 
 He got booed because his rhymes are so lame 
 He ain't the only one 
 He's far from it 
 There's more on Earth 
 And they're all gonna plummet 
 Like falling stars 
 Because a brother's in charge 
 I'ma stomp mud holes in they ass like they was El DeBarge 
 Then charge to the front of the class 
 Suckers everywhere like broken glass, yo 
 But I'ma keep troopin' through the Meadow with the fellow named X 
 And a pillow 
 To sock the pussy willows 
 While I get dough as I grow as a rhymer 
 And they can keep showin' their teeth like Aunt Jemima 
 It's the same ol' thing... 
 ...And it's gettin' kinda ancient, 
 I'm in your face with force 
 To eliminate monotonous 
 Braggin' and boastin' so most will end up profitless 
 'Cause they ain't got a foot to stand on 
 And I'ma leave the stage bloodier than a Tampon 
 I can't get no rest 
 Because of gamin' little pests 
 Will step and try to test me with the same ol' thing 
 I wish it would stop 
 But more than likely it will not 
 Cause too many MCs got the same ol' thing 
 So I change and rearange rhyme patterens 
 Keep ya mind scatterin' 
 From the solar system 
 And I still dissed 'em 
 The ones with the CRUMBS on they lips 
 Talkin' about Sucka MCs that don't exist 
 And I get the gist 
 So don't play me like a imbecile 
 Thinkin' that ya large 
 But ya small as a thimble 
 Plus I get mantal over funky tracks 
 And ya still talkin' Sucka MCs? 
 That shit is wack 
 If I ever dissed an MC 
 It was one with a name 
 So don't tell me he was one in the same 
 Because I know better 
 I flow better than the average Joe 
 I use my nubian stick to overthrow that same ol' thing... 
 MCs out there got the same ol' thing 
 Got the sameol' game 
 And trip, some got the same ol' name 
 Like Rockmaster This 
 Mighty Kingathat 
 Who died and left you the Wolfman, Jack? 
 But the Boogiemen are irregular 
 Spactacular, dracula 
 And plus we're gettin' clever 
 I never had the urge to ass a tag to my title 
 And I won't add a (rah!) or a (huh!) at the end of my recital 
 Hip hop hibbit 
 I never say a rhyme like that 
 'Cause I can take my time and give it 
 Thought, so I went and bought 
 A pen and pad 
 Now I'm makin' MCs real mad 
 Like Young MC 
 Goin' out like Sugar Hill 
 Add a new beat 
 New rhyme (huh!) 
 Bogus still 
 And even if we are in the same gang 
 It ain't no need 
 For all MCs to have the same ol' thing... 
 ...And it's gettin' mighty ancient...
