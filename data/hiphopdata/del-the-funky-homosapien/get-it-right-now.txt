Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Why wait, why debate? Get it right now 
 Before they put me on time out or lights out 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 You need some motivation, you need to know your place and 
 Fall back or get called out, know what I'm sayin'? 
 You need some motivation, you need to know your place and 
 Fall back or get called out, know what I'm sayin'? 
 Oh, you didn't know? Well, it go like this 
 Open up your blinds, let that light shine through 
 It's Del with the IQ of Einstein 
 The final equation, elated to rhyme to the audience 
 Haters can't relate, they be tryin' to start arguments 
 All them fools marked for death and they toe get tagged 
 When a flow dispatched, it make foes relax 
 And think about it a second 
 Before I even touch the mic and that's without a suggestion 
 Start countin' your blessin's, I'm clownin' you peasants 
 Who be doubtin' my message, your style's not impressive 
 I'm usin' my time wisely, nothin' can slide by me 
 Fools try me then at the end be like, "Why me?" 
 Why not? I can see your blind spot 
 Birds try to jock, they can go find the flock 
 Time is on the clock but not a second to watch 
 Got a plot synchronized on the dot, ready-or-not 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Why wait, why debate? Get it right now 
 Before they put me on time out or lights out 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Why wait, why debate? Get it right now 
 Before they put me on time out or lights out 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 I'm takin' this shit back to the essence 
 If anybody wanna talk shit, I got a message 
 Keep it to yourself or your health will be lessened 
 Depletin' like a energy bar 'cause you be stressin' 
 Stupidness, who is this nigga up in my business? 
 Get his ass up out of here before I start flippin' 
 Like channels on a remote control, I don't condone 
 Fools on the mic who can't hold they own 
 I'm on the throne zone, with me it's the ticket 
 To the next situation gettin' explicit, now picture it 
 Physical evidence gone, I'll be acquitted 
 Gettin' funky with the linguistics, that's tradition 
 Infliction of pain on perpetrators wishin' 
 To slip in my position but, nah, good riddance 
 If you didn't chip in, you can't get a bit of this 
 Deliberate backstabbin', that's shit's ridiculous 
 Biatch 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Why wait, why debate? Get it right now 
 Before they put me on time out or lights out 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Why wait, why debate? Get it right now 
 Yeah bitch, I'mma rhyme forever 
 X marks the spot, now go find the treasure 
 Funk fatality, battle me, you catchin' a blizzard 
 I got allergies affected by you wack-ass niggas 
 Let me go and get bread spit, hot lead, spread the gospel 
 Topple you fools that wanna pop so much shit 
 Fuck it, time for me to flush it 
 Do the people justice, rock my production 
 Hoes be lustin', no, you can't touch him 
 Follow his instructions, no, he ain't fuckin' 
 Indestructible, walk into the session 
 Soon as I catch the groove, it's impressive 
 Dilapidate your crew, niggas fake as you? 
 I can't relate to you 
 This is for the real people that take the truth and ingest it 
 Let it radiate in the soul and manifest it 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Why wait, why debate? Get it right now 
 Before they put me on time out or lights out 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Why wait, why debate? Get it right now 
 Before they put me on time out or lights out 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Why wait, why debate? Get it right now 
 Before they put me on time out or lights out 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now 
 Get it right, get it now, get it right now
