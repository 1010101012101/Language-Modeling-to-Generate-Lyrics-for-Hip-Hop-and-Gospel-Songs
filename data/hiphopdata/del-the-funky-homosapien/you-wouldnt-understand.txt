Yo, I'm staying where we gettin' crazy love 
 My noisy neighbors live just above me up in 13 A 
 The stripper says hes gunna fix the heat for sure, I've heard it 5 times before 
 3 locks on every door, cause sum folks got the tendency to take 
 It ain't beverly hills more like stephanie mills 
 I never knew love like this could every exist 
 Four corners in your metropolis 
 Yo its it's the p-jays (boy) 
 We exquisit like hard laid floorin 
 When gun shots keep you up instead of heavy snoring, pipes drippin 
 Instead of rivers pourin 
 The elevators broken, damn man I'm needin a lift 
 Thank god I don't stay up on the 25th floor 
 Yo we ain't always at war its alot about the projects 
 I do adore 
 But you wouldn't understand it, the p-jays is like another planet 
 You wouldn't understand it, the cops would catch your drawers down red handed its outlanded 
 (x2) 
 Come through our projects about 4 in the morning 
 So I can tell you what be goin' on there 
 One block, gun shots, some hot stuff, sell it to you for a buck? boy that ain't enuf 
 Hand cuffs on your brother man 
 My wifes wonderin, when you gonna fix the tenants plumbing man 
 I'm tired, this ghettos cool but its on fire 
 I see this fool with his crack pipe lookin' wired 
 Hookers for hire, look at the ply wood 
 On the building where termits is livin' 
 My wife sleeps peacely, it ain't easy for me 
 'Cause I'm trippin' off these ppl with their thieviery 
 Black white chicano, hell if I no 
 Every guy know about the stolen cell phone 
 I got the hookup, police got me shook up 
 In court, can't even fort, its okay though 
 I got the building, the pay dough 
 But some tenants act like they just say no 
 I'm gettin' older in my years, feel me 
 I've got a folder worth of fears 
 But its cool, we gotta make it better 
 Don't take my sweater 
 Y'all make my head hurt 
 I ain't even gunna finish this song 
 It's too long 
 Ima watch cops in my lazy boy and my thong
