"Ahonetwo, ahonetwo, I like it..." 
 I'm chocolate like a Barr 
 But my name is not Roseanne 
 My skin has a pigment, reminiscent of a tan 
 I plan to grow dreads 
 But first a nappy fro 
 The longer the hair 
 The easier to scare a foe 
 It grows from my head until it covers up my face 
 People look and stare when I walk into the palce 
 This is just a taste form the Funkee Human Being 
 Ain't no misbehavin' 
 Ain't no use for ravin' 
 Surrounded by the people who would stab me in the back 
 My skin is really brown 
 Even though it's labeled black 
 Sometimes I wear a cap, and sometimes I wear bandannas 
 Forbidden in L.A. but I wore one in Atlanta 
 I chisled up a sculpture 
 To complement my culture 
 Thoughts of silly nubians is prone to give me ulcers 
 Hangin' with the brothers who are tribal in their ways 
 For this is how I like to spend my days 
 And it pays 
 To steal a groovy sample form the archives 
 Use my mental staff to eliminate aparthied 
 Still gather papes like my man Malcolm Forbes 
 Ponderin' my life as I look into my orbs. 
 I love the shade of green like my brother Billy Bixby 
 I utilise a sample that I salvaged from the 60's 
 'Cause I'm picky 
 My meal must appeal to me like Morris 
 Far too many fraudulent opponents in the forest 
 I fall into the Gap when I need to purchase clothes 
 Easy on the fads 
 Cause the posers always pose 
 I suppose they will bite 
 They'll try not to show it 
 I came very plain and then feelin' rather loaded 
 I ditched all the beads 
 Cause my needs seem to differ 
 Me and CM-P are like the Gil and the Skipper 
 He will use his clippers to give himself a fade 
 I give my fro a sheen with a smidgin of Pomeade 
 I laid in the shade and I greeted mixel place 
 With a rhythm and a rhyme 
 And he said that it's a twist 
 From the ordinary everyday continual assumption 
 That R&B & Rap makes a winner 
 Guess who's comin' through for dinner 
 A native-like brother with the passive little style 
 That most certainly will smother 
 Suicidal rhymes with apocyliptic tunes 
 I will drink a seltzer while you dabble with the booze 
 And giggle when I see ya liver shrivel to a prune 
 I'm the Funky Human Being 
 Not a monkey or a coon 
 Assume that the style is Funkadelic in the 90's 
 Del is livin' phat 
 As I leave a foe behind me.
