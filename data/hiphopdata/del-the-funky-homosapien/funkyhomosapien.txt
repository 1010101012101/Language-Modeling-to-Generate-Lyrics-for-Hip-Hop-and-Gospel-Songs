Just who is this? 
 Meet the emperor 
 Sure to keep your temperature 
 Tropical 
 Hot as hell fire 
 Del's dire straits 
 Might awaken to '85 
 And some say I'm a little, um 
 How can I phrase it? 
 Out of the spectrum with 
 Language radiance personified 
 But I'll let y'all be the judge 
 You can call me whatever you want 
 I just come to give you pleasure with funk 
 That's my forte 
 The others be sorbet 
 Mushy consistency 
 Yeah they push me 
 Whiff with me 
 ??? 
 Ever giving a fuck about they hard luck depend on me 
 When they don't see 
 Your luck is circumstantial 
 And at your will 
 Use it or lose it stupid 
 Do it for you 
 'Cause nobody's going to do it for you 
 So let's go 
 Hey yo, Del. 
 What? 
 The fuck is a funky homosapien? 
 It's a human being, fool. A funky human being. 
 'Aight 
 Peep game then 
 From the main man 
 Diesel 
 I got a lot to say man 
 But niggaz try to play me like the rain man 
 Hoes try to take me on the train man 
 Knowing that the tracks at the end 
 Just collapsed into an empty canyon 
 Abandoned 
 It's a sad one 
 Who plots devious plans 
 In Satan's name 
 'Cause they can't take the game 
 'Cause they fake and lame 
 Come on break these chains 
 We can get this settled real easy. 
 Is that what this is all about? 
 It's psychological 
 And not mythological 
 Bitch get a job for real 
 Not hoein' or dick blowin' 
 Then you can tell me where you goin' 
 D know no one need to be holdin' a grudge 
 'Cause I'm a start a nigga showin' some love 
 Plus at the end 
 Everybody will be closing they mug 
 We all ball so I know I'm a scrub 
 Right on 
 Get up 
 Get the dirt off my shoulder blades 
 You gotta fail to succeed 
 So no one's safe 
 Yes you gotta risk it 
 It's the mother of invention 
 I'm butter with the diction 
 What a fucking whiz kid 
 Taught by the best 
 I flip it with finesse 
 I'm different from the rest 
 We all gotta step 
 To the batter's box 
 So it matters not 
 What a chatterbox 
 Blab about 
 We don't even know what that about 
 All I'm trying to do is find out what this is all about 
 Man, come on fool 
 Hey yo, Del. 
 What? 
 The fuck is a funky homosapien? 
 It's a human being, fool. A funky human being. 
 'Aight 
 Ah yeah yeah, sure you do 
 I heard you were going about 
 With a whole bunch of doubt now 
 Rolling about without knowledge of self 
 Is gonna get you in a situation 
 Whipped with a belt 
 You couldn't excel? 
 Do it again 
 The first time you get you hands on the sticks 
 You ain't gonna be the shit 
 That's why they're practicing doctors 
 Practicing mathematicians and authors 
 All for the scrill 
 Man chill 
 Man you ain't for real 
 You ain't moving a muscle till I peel back some bills? 
 Fool, you still hawking pills 
 Be a part of it instead of being slick like a eel 
 Silly 
 You think you slick? 
 Think you slick? 
 You think you foxy? 
 Never 
 Never, I tell you 
 Not a dime!
