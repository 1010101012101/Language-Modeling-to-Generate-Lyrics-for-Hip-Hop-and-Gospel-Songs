D he back in the chamber 
 Packing the tame and 
 Black entertainment 
 Back with a vengeance 
 Slapping you midgets 
 Acting suspicious 
 The macking is vicious 
 Vernacular spectacular 
 Rapping all the time 
 It's relaxing on the mind 
 Peace is the word 
 But I beast on a bird 
 Trying to feast or splurge 
 Put them feet to the curb 
 As soon as you get out my bathroom 
 And I'm calling a cab too 
 D ain't that dude 
 Close your mouth 
 Hoes is out 
 In the cold without 
 No clothes no house 
 No holding me back 
 I told you when I get to flow 
 She a rat 
 Excuse my language 
 But they play a game which 
 Leaves folks open 
 To any trick she hoping 
 To get to work 
 Anything better than to 
 Hit the turf 
 Sucking dicks for work 
 And a straw a skirt 
 She berserk 
 You really naughty and you think you awfully foxy 
 All the stunts that you pull is rather shocking 
 Go ahead and cock me back in the chamber 
 You see my weave through the drama and the danger 
 You do things that your mama is ashamed of 
 Name one nigga who gonna save you 
 Ain't one 
 You really naughty and you think you awfully foxy 
 All the stunts that you pull is rather shocking 
 Go ahead and cock me back in the chamber 
 You see my weave through the drama and the danger 
 Diesel back in the chamber 
 Cross up at ya 
 For dangling the hoe for a bankroll 
 Ain't no nigga civilized 
 Another rise above ??? 
 Mount a bitch 
 Clowned a bitch 
 Looking astounded 
 While they surround a bitch 
 Whoopsie I'm out the loop see 
 That's just how it is 
 I don't crowd the wig 
 With tales about 
 How you jerks turn out ??? 
 I'm about my peers 
 My pixels trick hoes 
 Always try to stir my mix though 
 Nu-uh not off the herbs and cisco 
 Brought this shit back 
 But big though 
 Now dig, hoe 
 Keep your lid closed 
 About my nabisco 
 Or you gonna get a clip thrown 
 Into your hip bone 
 I got the photographs 
 Of you hoeing ass 
 Getting fucked slow and fast 
 Blowing hash 
 Yeah that hoe is fast 
 But I'm Flash Gordon 
 Snortin' 
 I'm sharper than a thorn tip 
 What you laughing for, bitch? 
 I don't see nothing funny 
 Sucker
