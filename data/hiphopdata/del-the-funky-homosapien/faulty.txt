Man, I knew this nigga from back in the day 
 I never knew he would be actin' this way 
 He displayed some faulty shit 
 Wish I would have caught the bitch 
 I stuck to talkin' shit 
 Instead of setting off the apoclypse 
 Out in the O, they try to play you like kermits 
 Out in the O, they'll smoke your ass like sherm sticks 
 Definitly something to be concerned with 
 You can't trust these nigga's 
 And it's time that I learned this 
 This nigga that I went to school with 
 Asked me for five bills 
 Whatchu gonna do with that 
 'Bout to give you a whole five dollar bill 
 If the shit had been real 
 It wouldn'ta been a big deal 
 But faultiness strikes 
 He said let's take a hike up the block 
 And I'll give you the five out my sock 
 I gave him two, my homie gave him three 
 We was both wonderin' what the fuck this gonna be 
 He took us over to a project building 
 I was bent of sisco thinkin' *grunts* 
 He said wait here and I started yelling 
 He didn't make clear his intentions while he bailin' 
 Del infureated, lost it 
 I drew the line, he crossed it 
 It's time to burn his ass like I was caustic 
 I was screamin', beamin' 
 This lady came out her apartment and said 
 Bounce if you're here to start shit, little boy 
 She was like 
 Some shit happened out here last night 
 Get the fuck out 'cause it won't be no fight 
 This other nigga came out and said 
 Don't shout, yoe money gone 
 Take this if you still want to pout about it 
 He opened his hand and I was shocked 
 In it was a crack rock 
 I said what the fuck I'm suppose to do with this, eat it 
 I said keep that shit and then the lady said beat it 
 He told you your money gone, so get your ass on 
 I just did it 'cause I wasn't alone 
 This mighty morphen nigga who I thought was a friend 
 Transformed and got the arm was nothing but a fiend 
 He was fiendish, fiendish 
 He was suckin' base pipes like a penis 
 He was fiendish 
 Fuck that punk
