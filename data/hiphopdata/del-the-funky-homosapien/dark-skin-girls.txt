As simple as it sounds 
 It's as simple as it ought to be 
 Light skin girls lack the dark skin quality 
 Ya don't understand? 
 You want an explanation? 
 Well let D-e-L release the frustration 
 As I see it 
 Every single day 
 Light skin girls ain't satisfied unless they get their way 
 Always 
 Plus they act stuck up 
 They all add up to one great big phuck up 
 They try to play suck up 
 When they want somethin' 
 Then always leave a brother with nothin' 
 Ya think ya look better cause ya skin's a little bit lighter? 
 You're thinkin' you're my type 
 Like I was a typewriter? 
 No, ya think ya all-uh-that and all-uh-this 
 But you ain't really shit 
 Without a makeup kit 
 See, ya might be light 
 But ya ugly to me 
 Black is beautiful 
 To me, that's beauty. 
 (Chrous:) 
 "Dark skin girls are better than light skin, light skin girls ain't 
 Better than dark skin,... 
 CUBE: I disagree homeboy!" 
 Now 
 Let's get to the problems 
 And see if there's a way to solve them 
 Problem #1, has got to be the attitude 
 Which is usually vain, selfish and rude 
 Personality, wit 'er nose stuck up 
 So don't try talkin' to her 
 Or walkin' with her 
 To class 'cause it's out of the question 
 Cause you bein' dark is the wrong complexion 
 For her, 
 She wish she was light, though 
 I mean lighter than light 
 Or as close to white as possible 
 But I fight to stay a brother 
 You see, 
 Green and dark skin sisters are the color 
 This don't apply to all the girls with light skin 
 Just the ones with their heads up their rear end 
 'Cause if ya did, static would occur 
 Dark skin cuties is what I prefer 
 Now, look at her 
 Her vision is a blur 
 Cause contact lenses only let ya see Benzes 
 Plus she would fuss and cuss if I tried to talk to her 
 'Cause I'm a man who rides the bus 
 I get frustrated 
 Well, lets say I used to 
 Now a dark and lovely 
 Is who I give juice to 
 So come on 
 Step to Del if ya with this 
 This is the facts 
 So brothers don't forget this. 
 I can't understand 
 You light skin wenches 
 Ya think ya all that cause ya have long extensions? 
 Your hair was natural 
 Now ya got played out braids 
 You woulda looked better with a fade 
 Dark skin girls are so fly, so honest, so sweet 
 That's the type of girl I wanna meet 
 Complete, 
 Not phony or a fake like you are 
 See, Del is bolder 
 I tap you on the shoulder 
 And say, 'Hey lighty 
 Could you tap that sister for me?' 
 But you love Mr. Loveable 
 So you'll just ignore me 
 So find another tip that you can hop upon 
 To get with me ya need some sun and some Coppertone 
 You'll take a white boyfriend before a black one 
 That's why Del has to stand and attack one 
 Next time you see a girl darker than you 
 No disrespct when you met her, cause the girl looked better than you.
