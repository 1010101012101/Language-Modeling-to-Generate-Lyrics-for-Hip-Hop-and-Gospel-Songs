Diesel 
 Back to rap to y'all 
 Unloading 
 A lot off my chest 
 No sense in 
 Holding 
 Onto it, ya know? 
 Keep it rolling 
 While some walk around like 
 "Gimme you owe me" 
 Not kidding 
 I mean totally 
 Lost in self denial 
 Full of bologna 
 So mean 
 Always mad and loathing 
 Everything surrounding 
 Just sucking 
 Everybody energy up like 
 Protein 
 Gossiping 
 Lots of them don't even know me 
 Posing, fraudulating 
 Whole scenes 
 For the viewing pleasure 
 Of those with 
 No things 
 To occupy themselves 
 And keep 'em growing 
 But y'all know me 
 I see no need 
 To stifle your thing 
 Especially if we homies 
 But if that's the way it's gonna be 
 So be it 
 No grievance 
 I don't fear my soul 
 I mean just situations that we go through 
 But you can't let emotions control you 
 Fools will go and try to throw you 
 'Cause they know it's a way to control you 
 They say I'm cold but I told you 
 I've got goals I focus on the whole view 
 D-E-L y'all I'm tellin' y'all 
 It's no beef 
 Why the owner solo creek 
 Fools keep 
 Shit on the slunder 
 But I'm a go deep 
 I mean so deep below 
 Behold the whole sea 
 Soul seek 
 Visualize and peep the choral reef 
 That goes for those 
 Who feel they so elite 
 So weak 
 About how shit supposed to be 
 Y'all dopes to me 
 Sit back insultin' me 
 But you don't get more votes than me 
 I outshine 
 You don't generate as many volts as me 
 Still I could cut the lights 
 I'm low key 
 But that don't stop the hoes 
 They nosy 
 You know how hoes be 
 They think they pussy gold 
 Please 
 I told her please 
 You chose me 
 To get close to me 
 To get dough from me 
 I ain't buying it 
 And now you feel alone and weak 
 Went from "daddy" to ignoring me 
 Went from ignoring me to ordering me 
 Um, went from that to tryin' to throw with me? 
 Now you gotta go 
 You gonna ho the streets 
 And you mama said 
 "No, she know more than me" 
 So you can't go home and sleep 
 And D ain't givin' up dough to freak 
 And ya know that 
 I mean just situations that we go through 
 But you can't let emotions control you 
 Fools will go and try to throw you 
 'Cause they know it's a way to control you 
 They sleep, they reap below you 
 You can tell they emotions show through 
 They say I'm cold but I told you 
 I've got goals I focus on the whole view 
 Just situations that we go through 
 But you can't let emotions control you 
 Fools will go and try to throw you 
 'Cause they know it's a way to what? control you 
 Uh 
 They sleep, they weep way below you 
 And you can tell they emotions show through 
 Now they say I'm cold but I told you 
 I've got goals I focus on the whole view 
 Just situations that we go through 
 But you can't let emotions control you 
 Fools will go and try to throw you 
 'Cause they know it's a way to control you 
 They sleep, they weep below you 
 You can tell they emotion show through 
 They say I'm cold but I told you 
 I've got goals I focus on the whole view
