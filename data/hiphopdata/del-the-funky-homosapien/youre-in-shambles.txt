(Check it out... 1st to bat, steppin' up to the plate is...) 
 I'm the monsta' 
 Come on in closa' 
 I'll roast ya' 
 Not never worried 'bout competition 
 Listen 
 I can twist men 
 Into pretzels 
 My jet skills, can outrun 
 'Cause it's fun 
 I'm not done 
 One or even two could even try 
 It's not a even try 
 I'll leave 'em, why 
 Did you do it, I'ma school kids and tease 'em and please 'em 
 For the treason 
 That's the reason 
 I'ma squeeze 'em 
 Make 'em tell 
 And make 'em dwell 
 They're not dead 
 I got lead, but I won't use it 
 I'll refuse it 
 'Cause they're losin' 
 I'll be merciful 
 I won't hurt the skull, with the hollow tip 
 I'll make sure they follow tips, that I tell 'em 
 I won't spell 'em, out 
 They'll shout, in horror 
 'Cause they saw a metamorphis 
 I'ma force kids out the galaxy 
 So now ask me 
 Don't try to go around 
 Because I know the sound 
 They're not stealthy 
 I'm dope, the opposers - I make sure you chose the straight and narrow 
 Prepare though, and be careful 
 "You had your chance, you blew it X3 
 You had your chance..." 
 Now peep this, they forgot 
 And now they gonna rot 
 They didn't know that they could sell a lot, (a lot) 
 Of trash 
 'Cause it doesn't smash or last 
 They got cash, but now 
 How are you gonna survive 
 Because you strive to gamble 
 You're in shambles, and I'm glad 
 I could add flavor 
 I'm the savior, misbehavior can catch hell 
 None can match Del 
 Unless they stress, fresh 
 I'm nonetheless and take a guess 
 The one that make 'em go back and tell they crew 
 That Del is true, he tell a new way to say whatever's clever 
 I'm gonna sever 
 Necks of those who don't respect the rap legacy 
 Because I egg MC's, 
 On the late night 
 They got away writin' clever raps 
 'Cause with that bullshit it sounds like they never rapped 
 In they life 
 I got a knife, that is lyrical 
 And Del is causin' fear and still has potential (potential) 
 They didn't learn 
 Now the money's gonna burn 
 I yearn to make rap better... 
 Let's stick together! 
 "You had your chance and you blew it X3 
 You had your chance, you had your chance, you had your chance, uh... you 
 Blew it!" 
 [Del, tha funkee homosapien, from Hieroglyphics] (Repeated)
