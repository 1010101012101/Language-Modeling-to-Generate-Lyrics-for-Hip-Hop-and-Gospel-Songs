Del, my main brain function is gang bustin' 
 I aim ??? scrumptious gumption despite ur assumptions 
 I like lumpin' up dumb cuts w/ abundance 
 Rhyme resevoirs that glitter like a gun bust (bloaww!) 
 Obnoxious to coppers and fake Hip-Hoppers 
 They bite my steez and try to doctor my cross-words 
 For the highest offer I plot the Oxford 
 Poetical posture that gotcha, like the shocker 
 Nocturnal burning herbals, playin' Turbo Graphics 
 Federal Reserve ur cabbage, u don't deserve to have it 
 Curb ur habit, a fictional farce and fairy tales 
 I know you very well, and rise to the top like Ariel 
 Periscope's up when I loc' up 
 Landmine logistics, the digits ain't listed 
 I flood cupboards w/ natural disorder 
 'Cause when I dosha, I switch over 
 I sent cobras amongst ur rosebuds 
 No buzz, not even from 500 pounds of Folgers 
 Go get u a pass, u sniffin' the ass 
 Pay attention in class, 'cause if you do that 
 U might... 
 Get it in focus 
 Didn't you know this 
 This mission is hopeless 
 Pitifull poets 
 Didn't get no wins 
 My signature slogans 
 Splittin' ya open 
 Hittin' the dosha...??? 
 Better listen closer 
 ...Focus ur mind 
 My ride quality quantum armed when gone to lunch 
 And you can come along w/ us 
 My syllables savvy; Gravity's entrapped in cabins 
 W/ brain ?seizures? so pack ur aspirin 
 Burn baby burn ur chapped and blackened like charcoal 
 But our soul subtracts the sacchrin 
 And cheesy packaging, we be trafficking the contraband 
 On a plantation after we break in... 
 Nothin' can awaken, shakin' ur mind 
 W/ blatent basement bombshells that keep strafing 
 Have faith in Me and Paul 
 The weed I freeze the remedial and eat 'em like a Peter Paul 
 Beat 'em all fair and square, prepare for static 
 I'm char-is-matic, from hair to fabric 
 Avid aviator when I'm facin' Vader 
 Within' divine sacks, I leave ur mind and ur spine tapped 
 Face the music, embrace the true sense 
 Of pain, when I stomp ur brain and leave shoe prints 
 If you hot, then I'm the coolant 
 I rule w/ ironclad mandibles, they trap u ??? 
 When I'm upon the track, it's a common fact, I'm bombing that 
 Smash it like a pomegranate, better call in management 
 Tandem mist of cannabis, random sniffs get you ramblin' 
 The ambulance will handle that, examin' facts 
 Ferociously, u spoke to me like you close to me 
 Like you folks w/ me, who you 'sposed to be? 
 Next thing I know u'll try to dose my weed 
 Toast to me, 'cause I broke the speed barrier 
 Repairin' it is arrogance on ur part 
 Sure start the core operation, it's hard to face him 
 'Cause bars away from an incarceration 
 I ain't into operations that ain't makin' me 
 Cake up cheese, give or take a G 
 Feel the nature's breeze on my naked knees 
 But for leisure, Do not disturb, I'll kick ur keister 
 Unleash the Beast Wars take three-fourths 
 When I leap forth, I resort to G Force 
 U better creep soft, watch where ur feet walk 
 Or profile meets chalk by the see-saws, retard 
 Coincidently, simply raw 
 Fill out this entry form, so we can get beyond 
 The nifty song you dissed me on 
 Now you the new contestant on my truth confessions 
 Teach the youth a lesson they're not used to gettin' 
 I got a team of writers like the King of Fighters 
 That never seem to 'tire 
 That's the reason why you gotta...
