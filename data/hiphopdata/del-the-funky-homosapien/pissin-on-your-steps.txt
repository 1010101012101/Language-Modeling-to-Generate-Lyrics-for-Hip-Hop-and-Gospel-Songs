It's D-E-L the Funkee Homosapien 
 To the rescue 
 I'm solo and threw a bolo and left two 
 Dancers back on Soul Train 
 And ya know Soul Train get the phat doodie stain 
 Now what ya gonna do with the board with no talent 
 Using step 1 & step 2 to keep the show valid 
 Let's have a vote and try to register our ballots 
 And realise a Hammer's just a mallet 
 Toss him like a salad 'cause he ain't truly gifted 
 Now the party's lifted by the crew HIEROGLYPHICS 
 Golly-wolly, not another Elvis and Priscilla 
 Ice is cool, but I can't stand Vanilla 
 Because he takes a style and tries to mock it 
 Ain't nothin' personal, G 
 But I'm kinda inta chocolate 
 It's all about the black 
 And it's like that 
 And I'm so laid back 'cause I smoked a phat sack 
 Plus I'm almost through and done with a whole 40-dog of Olde English 
 800 
 Now I peep ya concept 
 Ya think ya got a rep? 
 Dance all day, while I'm pissin' on your steps. 
 "Ooh, ooh, pissin' on your steps..." 
 No Del 
 Is not a mean fellow 
 Just because I wanna turn your dance shoes yellow 
 See I'm rather mellow 
 Some call it lazy 
 Me and myself 
 And I ain't with the daisies 
 'Cause I'm no g ddam flower 
 And every single dancer in circumference 
 Receives a golden shower 
 I'm here to insult the 
 Hip hop John Travolta 
 Ya think ya all that 
 But really you're shorter than a midget 
 I don't fidgit, with the ballet, 
 CUBE: Phuck a dancer! 
 DEL: Because that's what my pals say 
 And brothers don't shake ya rumps 
 Wearin' biker shorts is like chokin' on ya nuts 
 Because ya might end up with a cramp or a hernia 
 And that's much worse, than a fine girl burnin' ya 
 Plus it ain't fly for you to have your behind 
 Blasted all out like a feline 
 See I'm givin' you advice 
 Make ya think twice 
 Cause dance groups don't last past Minute Rice 
 So change ya conept 
 Acquire some skills on the mic while I'm pissin' on your steps. 
 "I gotta take a leak for the weak... (REPEAT)"
