Yo 
 Stackin' chips 
 Crackin' whips 
 Back in this 
 Son of a bitch 
 Punish ya if 
 Ya comin' to get 
 Some of my chips 
 I summon a bliss 
 Runnin' the streets 
 Tongue in cheek 
 Pummeling beats 
 Tunneling freaks 
 Feel me black 
 I really rap 
 Conceal the trap 
 I deal the pack 
 Going gone 
 Growing long 
 Loading arms 
 Throwing bombs 
 I find the answers 
 Design the chapters 
 I'm someone who knows 
 I run this show 
 Workin' it, exertin' it, you're it now fully immersed in it 
 Workin' it, merchin' it, make sure you get what you're worth from it 
 Workin' it, exertin' it, you're it now fully immersed in it 
 Workin' it, merchin' it, make sure you get what you're worth from it 
 I state the claim 
 I break the chains 
 But show no shame 
 'Cause I know the game 
 Fools know I'm sane 
 But got a loaded brain 
 So I leave the soldiers stained 
 While I'm a flow some game 
 I totally maim 
 Throw on my rotary exchange 
 Exposing the chains 
 I know when to feint 
 When my motor is hanger 
 I'm holding those same words 
 And load 'em on paper 
 That gets flowed into vapor 
 Promoting the caper 
 You soaking the lake up 
 Hatred 
 I take it back to basics 
 I lace my kicks. 
 I always knew that I would make it stick 
 I'm adhesive 
 Far from intermediate 
 I can see the cliff 
 I make beats or rip 
 Plus freak the shit 
 Out a geeky bitch 
 Let 'em meet the strip 
 I'm completely hip 
 Now I want y'all to groove me your feet to this 
 Workin' it, exertin' it, you're it now fully immersed in it 
 Workin' it merchin' it, make sure you get what you're worth from it 
 Workin' it, exertin' it, you're it now fully immersed in it 
 Workin' it, merchin' it, make sure you get what you're worth from it 
 This is how I take it 
 Dish it out then take it 
 That ain't about no paper 
 It's about my patience 
 I don't twiddle my thumbs 
 I know how to make it 
 Jump off I don't 
 Promote this tough talk 
 I do what I do 
 I win and you lose 
 Trying to put in your two? 
 I don't listen to fools 
 Misconstrue the truth 
 And all logic 
 You think you all that but 
 I think not, and yo 
 I link farther back 
 To puff starters 
 And parkas 
 And shoe jackets 
 Niggaz will shoot at ya 
 I'm a real dude 
 So I feel you 
 Show you an ill view 
 Always build new 
 Structures to touch ya 
 I've pumped substance 
 Always up to something 
 But no fronting 
 Workin' it, exertin' it, you're it now fully immersed in it 
 Workin' it, merchin' it, make sure you get what you're worth from it 
 Workin' it, exertin' it, you're it now fully immersed in it 
 Workin' it, merchin' it, make sure you get what you're worth from it 
 Workin' it, exertin' it, you're it now fully immersed in it 
 Workin' it, merchin' it, make sure you get what you're worth from it 
 Workin' it, exertin' it, you're it now fully immersed in it 
 I said you're fully immersed in it 
 You're fully immersed in it
