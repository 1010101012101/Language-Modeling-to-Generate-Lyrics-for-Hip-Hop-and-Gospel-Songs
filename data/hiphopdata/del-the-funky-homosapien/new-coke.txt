Look out the window 
 Look at all that bullshit going on down there in the street 
 What's all that shit floating out in the water 
 Yeah we gotta get out of here we gotta go to some island 
 Grab your shopping cart 
 Grab your cane 
 Let's get the heck out of here 
 We gotta move closer to the equator 
 When are they gonna start showing those list of TV runs 
 I used to love that guy 
 Remember how he used to watch mr T. wrestling 
 Coca cola doesn't taste the same as it used to 
 Remember when a bowl of soup was a nickel 
 All that bass is gonna break my ears
