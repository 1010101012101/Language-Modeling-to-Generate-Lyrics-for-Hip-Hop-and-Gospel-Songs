Come on and let the games begin 
 'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends 
 And the friends to tha end that don't pretend 
 So have fun, have fun, have fun while it lasts 
 It's time to max, relax, ask anybody 
 You got off work, you know your boss is a jerk 
 Wether you a clerk or a rapper like me 
 We all need to kick back and be care free 
 See, no plea barginin', no harborin' 
 Negative attitude when you're out with your dudes 
 Damn it feels good when the weekend comes 
 Ya done finished your homework, ya out with the buds 
 Clownin', y'all downin' whatever goes 
 You throw in a tape hear a nigga kick his flows 
 Cruise down the strip and pop at some hoes 
 Y'all still havin' fun 
 No matter what scenario ya chose 
 Even on the solo with those 
 Take off ya clothes 
 But not without the condoms 
 'Cause that's bose 
 Those woke up the next day, call ya patna's 
 Pitch in for a ten and start up the festivities 
 No fuckin' worries when ya livin' free of stress 
 That's why we always smoke bomb, fuck sess 
 Y'all feel the best when y'all say less 
 At the (?) 'cause it's June 'cause we outta school 
 Come on and let the games begin 
 'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends 
 Come on and let the games begin 
 'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends 
 Come on and let the games begin 
 'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends 
 And the friends to tha end that don't pretend 
 So have fun, have fun, have fun while it lasts 
 Your friends are ya friends, like no matter what 
 Other fools get from ya team 
 It seems like they dream of gettin' next to you 
 But all they really do is pester you 
 'Cause they marks 
 Always wanna start funk when you wit 'em 
 'Cause when he got beef wit a nigga 
 He thinks y'all will get 'em 
 Now he rollin' with your crew 
 But with no crew 
 He wouldn't be poppin' doo-doo 
 His ass would be through 
 But now he drug you into it 
 And yes, all your boys 
 And now you gotta kill the noise 
 He destroys the whole vibe by frontin' 
 Tryin' to be hard, but he just Napoleon Bonaparte 
 A little nigga tryin' to take command 
 Thinkin' he the man, but fuckin' with him 
 Y'all w'all kick the can 
 I can't stand a fake 
 I kick it with my real nigga's come spring break 
 That's the ones I look out for 
 Never doubt your pals 
 Fuck them gals, don't let 'em separate you 
 Your friends and you will be chillin' 
 When that bitch hates you 
 Yeah, and I say 
 Come on and let the games begin 
 'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends 
 Come on and let the games begin 
 'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends 
 Come on and let the games begin 
 'Cause the game begin when you coolin' wit ya friends 
 The friends to tha end that don't pretend 
 So have fun, have fun, have fun while it lasts 
 Now when ya got business to attend 
 Take care of that 
 And afterwards fuck with your friends 
 Don't put shit off till tomorrow 
 Do it right now before you fuck with your pals 
 That's the down period, rest and relaxation 
 At that nigga Plus house 
 Let's go to nations and get fit 
 When life is the pits 
 You know I check my friends, make sure they legit 
 Wether is freestylin', you know we stylin' 
 Nigga's pillin' up with the gin in the cup 
 Or a blunt and no English, so nigga's think ya fiendish 
 Playin' NBA Jams and just like the beats we slam and dunk 
 Callin' niggas punks when we was poppin' junk, playin' dozens 
 'Cause we like cousins, and brothers 
 I wouldn't have it any other way 
 You know what they say, all work and no play, etc
