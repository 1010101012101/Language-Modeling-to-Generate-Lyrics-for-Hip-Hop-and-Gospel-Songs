People, they tend to front like they know 
 But they don't matter no no

 Last time we seen Sir Diesel he was hard at work 
 Breaking down people like you who thought they got here first 
 Of course that's utterly preposterous by their uninformed standards 
 Wishful thinking, uh, sinking faster 
 Deep down, until you get to the bottom 
 But it don't matter no no 
 Deep down, until you get to the bottom 
 But it don't matter no no 
 Holla, when you find out 
 You was call one 
 Hehehe 
 Hey yo 
 I don't even know where you got the idea from 
 Thinking you steer from the clear direction 
 Just wanna be anti, and I make a correction, check it 
 It's one thing when you back yourself in a corner 
 But it's a new ball game when put all the blame on any foreigner 
 You ain't superior, you think you're hearing god's word 
 Telling you the laws were made for you to prosper 
 Lots of nerve you got, that's a stupid plot to rule the spot 
 But you're too stupid to never grew a notch 
 Watch your fruits rot, you claim a new spot 
 Trying the same game, but the truth pops up 
 Sooner or later you're truly a hater 
 And when the illusion wavers, nothing can save ya 
 From getting vaporized 
 Now you looking for a safe place to hide 
 The whole foundation breaks from the inside 
 That's shaky pride, Why? 
 Confidence that's built high on stilts 
 Made with with carelessness is arrogant 
 Your position of guilt it sure to tilt 
 People, they tend to front like they know

 Yo 
 As the plot thickens you start to act different 
 Like it wasn't you always just hazy in my vision 
 Hmmm maybe but my wisdom will see through the system 
 Like x-rays so lets play a real tight position 
 Yeah there's top dogs, puppies, and then there's the middlemen 
 The top dogs look like y'all from my positioning 
 With all the yachts and all the knots and all the influence 
 Long paper from the underhanded shit you're doing 
 Let's make a deal, spin the wheel, like it's a game show 
 You made the rules though plus you play with fools gold 
 You pick a victim for a fight like it's your given right 
 You ain't living right that's why you descending right now 
 Lights out, quite foul was the lifestyle 
 Don't start to cry now, no price could buy you out 
 Of the karma from the drama, how you like me now? 
 I'm up here for awhile, but you're going ouuuut! 
 Stop frontin, Stop frontin, Stop frontin, Stop frontin 
 Can't front on me
