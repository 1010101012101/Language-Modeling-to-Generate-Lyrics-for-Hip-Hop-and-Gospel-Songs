Who fuses the music 
 With no illusions 
 Producing the blueprints 
 Clueless? 
 Automator, defy the laws of nature 
 Electronic monolith, throw a jam upon the disc 
 The futuristic loop it with the quickness 
 Hyper producin', hydrogen fusion, liquids keep your distance 
 First we coerce your brain patterns 
 Colaborate with time, consume and reprogram it 
 I apply the flow cannon 
 The combo so slammin' 
 Atomically reconstruct the old canvas 
 His logic impress 
 A hypnotic effect 
 Yeah Latin, patent, you could call it a gift 
 Man he all in the mix, nuclear physicist 
 Genetically tailored every bit of this stimulus 
 The day the walls of the cities 
 Will crumble away 
 Uncovering our naked souls 
 All start singing 
 Shouting 
 Screaming 
 Psionically, bionically forget how you feel 
 Especially formulated, the rest of you fornicated 
 It takes more to make this 
 He juggles variables 
 Unparalleled propulsion to carry the load 
 Neural surgeon, the purest virgin conducting currents 
 Musical Merlin, he shine like sterling 
 Watch Automator draw a laser of a higher intensity 
 And instantly miss a beat, create a symphony 
 Hey I know now, I know now (Repeat) 
 Automator's on the planet Earth 
 And he's gonna stop the war of the worlds 
 (Now how would he do that) 
 Deltron Zero is here as well, they kick together for real (That's pretty good man) Yeah 
 He told y'all evil doers he is truly gifted in the matters of rhythm (Yeah I'll give him that) 
 Yeah you got to give him doubt 
 With his infinite wisdom you know you got to get wit' him
