This is ridiculous, I have a sickness 
 The grass is always greener, I say fuck it burn the picket fence 
 Pestilence, eyes rolled back, pure masculine 
 Moody little bitches I'm foreseeing you some estrogen 
 Always keep you wet see, mermaid pussy 
 Ever seen the movie kids, no legs don't push me 
 I am making sculptures, you are using plaster 
 Screaming while you're dreaming, emcees need a dream catcher 
 You're not in my mind, you can't get the concept 
 You're not on my level, you might need a dub step 
 Walking to the death, not walking with the cleft, 
 Lip, sharp as an arrow tip, I'm just so sick of it 
 The smell is your upper lip, 
 And I'm jacking off a sparrow while I'm crashing a pirate ship, 
 Slow as molasses, quick as a whip 
 This beat's a filthy toilet, and I'm the fucking shit 
 Rollin' up some grass on the beat, huh 
 Nothin' on ya feet kinda sweet, huh 
 Nothin' one love gettin' high up as the stars at night 
 My feet rock steady, my heart beat savvy 
 My well ran dry, had no luck at the levy 
 I'm lyrically a genius like Fergie and Jesus 
 It's like a lightning bolt just hit the tip of my penis 
 The opposite of clean is, parallel with my style 
 One sip away from runnin' round with my pants down 
 Apparently I'm underground, sound breaking barriers 
 Everybody take up a danger area 
 I got a feelin' this beat's been to hell and back 
 You can see the hole stickin' straight through my radar cap 
 Smoke rings billow out the window of my Cadillac 
 This beat's the weed, and I'm the fucking cataract 
 Rollin' up some grass on this beat, huh 
 Landin' on ya feet kinda sweet, huh 
 Nothin' one love gettin' high up as the stars at night 
 Nothin' one love gettin' high up as the stars at night 
 ? 
 Rollin' up some grass on this beat, huh 
 Landin' on ya feet kinda sweet, huh 
 Nothin' one love gettin' high up as the stars at night 
 Nothin' one love gettin' high up as the stars at night
