 You WACK M.C.'s! 
 This a dedication to you WACK M.C.'s 
 This is a dedication to you WACK M.C.'s 
 And you're history... huh... 
 You WACK M.C.'s! 
 This a dedication to you WACK M.C.'s 
 This is a dedication to you WACK M.C.'s 
 And you're history 
 What a jerk! You need to find rhymes that'll work 
 You need to desert the rhymin field 
 You're a nerd, your rhymin yields and stops 
 My rhymin shield deflects your puny rhymes 
 They're 'spect so do decline - any challenge 
 Forfeit because your shit's - unbearable terrible 
 Sounds like you're sharin flows with Treach 
 Let's come to grips youse a drip 
 Arrogant son of a bitch none of us is rich 
 This is my stitch in time, enrichin minds 
 And twistin backs witcha simplistic raps 
 I let a little bit of my lyrics leak and lather 
 At my mouth like a mad dog 
 And seek and gather your neck and bite 
 I just dissect the mic 
 And correct the tykes so don't be sassy 
 You won't be lasting, chastising that's why things 
 Swing in my favor - watch your behavior! 
 (Del) 
 I can not stand no WACK M.C. 
 So step back if you please 
 And don't test me, you're history 
 I can not stand no WACK M.C. 
 So step back if you please 
 And don't test me, you're history 
 "Wack emcees - your time is up! 
 How many punks must I kill... kill?" (repeat 4X)

 You're jealous overzealous, Del is spectacular 
 In fact you are wack and far beyond dope be gone - nope! 
 You gets no respect, I pose a threat 
 'Cause you're wack and weak, in fact you tried to freak 
 Groovy, it was used before 
 You need to choose a more appealing sample 
 I seal and stamp fools like mail, you're quite stale 
 You might fail and I know you're paranoid 
 Beware, avoid Funky Homosapien, monkeys I will make of men 
 Take 'em into custody your style is rus-ty! 
 Plus we, hate R and B, cause that shit is sorry 
 That shit's for saps, just admit your raps 
 Don't cut the mustard, don't get flustered 
 Cause ya, skill is null and void 
 And your skull is void empty 
 Senseless defenseless I rinse this 
 Plague away with typhoons and you die soon 
 Why swoon when you hear a ballad, is what I tell a broad 
 Cause L a fraud, he ain't hella hard 
 I used to look up, now I wanna cook up 
 Your brain like bass and maintain ya space 
 'Cause I don't care! 
 I can not stand no WACK M.C. 
 So step back if you please 
 And don't test me, you're history 
 I can not stand no WACK M.C. 
 So step back if you please 
 And don't test me, you're history
