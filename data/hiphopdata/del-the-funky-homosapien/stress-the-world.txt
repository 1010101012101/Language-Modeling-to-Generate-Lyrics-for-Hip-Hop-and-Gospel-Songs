Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 (Stress the world) 
 I offer the maximum that you called for, 
 Who better, to get a crowd to go "Wow"? 
 Del, A champion true, 
 I do what the others can't do, 
 So when you come to, 
 Recognize I despise weak, 
 I'm at my peak I seek 
 More than the boredom you are accustomed to, 
 A connoisseur, 
 I love hip hop more, 
 Than I did as a kid, 
 So I gotta kid rid, 
 Of those, who pose, 
 Case closed, 
 I'm dynamic with panic 
 And it's exactly how I planned it 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Hah! 
 You better peep 
 Cause the price is very steep 
 For those who sleep, 
 I pile my rhymes by the heap, 
 On cassets, 
 LPs, CDs, and twelve inches, 
 Perform the shit, 
 And get the girls like bitches, 
 With good intentions, 
 The key word is redemption, 
 For those who try to shit on my crown, 
 Let's get down! 
 Plastic ass rappers 
 Get smashed like crackers, 
 First I shellack ya, 
 Then hit you with the lacquer, 
 Then I go to marijuana class 
 And study cultivation, 
 So I can make the USA a better nation, 
 Get smoked, mellow out, 
 Vibe, fuck the stress, 
 While I kill MCs that say 
 "He's relentless", 
 Past you, 
 At last due 
 To technological enhancements, 
 On my part, 
 The art advances, 
 My rhymes are ravishing, 
 Ravaging the hip hop surface, 
 To get to the underground, 
 Four pounds to purchase, 
 Merciless, 
 As soon as I insert the disk, 
 Into the S.P., 
 To make the world stress me, 
 Let's be up front and real, 
 What's up with this rap 
 Regurgitation that appeals to the masses? 
 I got pure plain funk, 
 Hold the mayo, 
 Like the formulation 
 Of ice crystals 
 Make the sun's halo, 
 A rainbow, 
 Pay in full 
 To MCs at large, 
 I barge and 
 Cordon them all when I 
 Charge! 
 Personally responsible, 
 Behind all the hoopla, 
 Havoc 'cross the board, 
 Get the trouble shooter, 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Make the world stress me 
 Stress the world 
 Make the world stress me 
 Stress the world 
 Make the, Make the world stress me, 
 Let's be up front and real 
 Mathematically correct, 
 Collect rent on the daily, 
 This ain't a prince project, 
 Put out on paisley park, 
 Deep dark funk, 
 To dunk your face in, 
 Fully animated 
 In a time where hip-hop's contaminated, 
 With corny niggers talkin' gibberish, 
 They make me feverish, 
 I merely pull this lever which 
 Enables me to unveil tales 
 Of Del in action, 
 Smoked to the fullest 
 Project my voice like bullets, 
 I deflect your sect, 
 I check the scanner, 
 Damn you're persistent, 
 I stand with my fist clenched, 
 Tightly around the microphone like a scepter, 
 With rhymes average MC's can't see like a specter, 
 The inspecter, 
 With the nectar, 
 Sharp like a black and decker, 
 I twist a nigger's neck 
 Like Chubby Checker, 
 Respect A, 
 Heiroglyphic insgnia, 
 You know it means murder, 
 With lyrics unhead of, 
 Stamina, stamina, 
 And with a new flow to boot, 
 Don't try to execute my patterin's, 
 I took hella notes while battlin, 
 Dismantling opponents alone 
 With my trusty verbs 
 Leave these MC's disturbed, 
 Everybody on my block 
 Knows I rock, 
 To MC's I'm hella cocky 
 So I keep my rhymes cocked 
 In position, 
 And if you actually listen, 
 To what I'm saying, 
 You'll see you can't resist them, 
 They're succulent, 
 And if you don't like them, 
 Fuck you then, 
 Anybody with taste, 
 Sees it's a delicacy, 
 Not a mere hors de'ovuerve, 
 Or haven't you heard, 
 And it's totally take out, 
 About a million served, 
 Like that! 
 Absolutely a beauty, 
 I crush the shit that's booty, 
 'Cause I figure it's my duty 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Stress the world 
 Raah! 
 Let's be up front and real, 
 Let's be up front and real, 
 Make the world stress me, 
 Let's be up front and real, 
 Let's be up front and real, 
 Make the world stress me, 
 Let's be up front and real, 
 Let's be up front and real, 
 Make the world stress me, 
 Let's be up front and real, 
 Let's be up front and real
