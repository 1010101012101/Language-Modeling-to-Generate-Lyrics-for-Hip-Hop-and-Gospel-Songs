Stomp that nigga out. Stomp this brother out. He's burning 
 Here we go again y'all 
 Against all obstructions 
 Fuck 'em I'm D-E-L 
 A man amongst some munchkins. 
 Ever since Toughskins 
 And Underoos I had to choose. 
 Said I was never gonna loose 
 On account of niggaz who's thumbing through. 
 She didn't think they slick friend 'em easy freaks who eat a dick. 
 Usually I read 'em quick that always seems too deep in it. 
 Always something problematic 
 Always got involved with static 
 How many names are gonna try to game me 
 And when I change me look make me angry? 
 Same thing niggaz do the marks 
 I figure they could use a talk 
 I'm a good listener crusin' parts 
 When showtime's over and it's through the heart 
 At that point no need to ask 
 No more talking I'm a beat that ass 
 But if I'm at fault I need to ask 
 Them things before I spizzaz 
 I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 Okay, I'm putting my F-O-O-T D-O-W-N now 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 Hey, I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 It's big, it's small 
 It really ain't nothin' at all 
 But it gather like an avalanche. 
 So I'm a stop it now while I have the chance 
 Vocal funk will surely grow 
 Which only mean my fury grow 
 Bitches must be perty slow 
 Thank 'em what they say I go for 
 No sir, I'm extra cool 
 I'm a let 'em go on do what they do 
 Fuck you fool say what you wanna 
 I can see that's what you love to do 
 Just don't touch me 'cause I ain't touching you 
 And I know you weak as hell so I treat you well 
 And that's the only reason why you speak to Del 
 Like a fan of BBL 
 You need to go read a book or take a hint 
 You're free to look but no you want to be a crook 
 In my neck that's causing pain 
 Sometimes I think you all the same 
 Cut me off all in my lane 
 But you can't cut what's in my brain 
 Think I'm playing but I ain't. 
 You think you staying but you can't 
 Don't be quaint 
 I'm in the paint 
 I'm a bust that shot to make you faint 
 I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 I said I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 Hey, I'm putting my F-O-O-T D-O-W-N now 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 Hey, I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 Yo, I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning) 
 Here we go again y'all against all who get all 
 Pissed off at D-E-L like they situation is his fault. 
 Bitch all you want, my niggaz is up in the front. 
 They smokin' blunts and you get the hunch 
 They ain't gotta be told more than once. 
 Bridge over troubled water 
 Beef in the bubble harder 
 Sayonara I don't harbor bad feelings 'cause I know karma 
 Is like a boomerang so fuck finding who's to blame. 
 I maybe used your change 
 But I ain't playin' your stupid games so I shook you 
 I don't use your name but I know all the spots you used to hang 
 But I don't really boost to bang. 
 I used to - that was a youthful thing 
 But now I jump out my nigga bags 
 And spit on fags when they shit on blacks 
 Yo man I'm too damn old to be playing around 
 Ah, let 'em mothafuckers just lay on the ground. 
 I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 Hey you, I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 Hey you, I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 You didn't know I'm putting my F-O-O-T D-O-W-N now 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 You, I'm putting my foot down 
 (My temperature is burning hot) 
 Stomp 
 Stomp 
 Bigfoot, bitch 
 Ya know, ya know, I just gotta mark my territory...
