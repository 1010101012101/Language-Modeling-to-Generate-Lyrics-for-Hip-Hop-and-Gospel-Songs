I never had real friends till now 
 I never had to steal endz 'cause that's foul 
 I walk the streets with the baseball bat feelin' secure 
 But I try not to incite fights that's immature 
 Actions that come back to haunt 
 I work hard to get the things that I want 
 And never flaunt 
 Never post where the most guys post high 
 I keep my focus towards the ground 
 And pound 
 Any brother who's my ace to my face 
 Even if snakes on the unda' 
 I try not to wonda' 
 Trainin' my brain wit' mental anguish 
 Strange, it's rather eerie 
 Clearly 
 Just a whim 
 I adjust the hymn 
 Deal with the dealers and the squealers and the jockeys 
 I can take the fizz out the carbonated copy 
 Imprints are made in the sand as I walk 
 Dim hints reveal rather grand as I talk 
 Small individuals seem larger 
 When they take charge of 
 Their antics 
 Makin' them gigantic 
 So you never suspect their neck bein' strained 
 So many situated thoughts in the brain 
 Heavy weight gain 
 So I weight train 
 'Cause to me the weight gain 
 Is a great gain 
 And I hate sane individuals 
 Close they nose to new aromas 
 I got the smellin' salts that are prone ta' 
 Clear the nasal, daze 
 You'll probably make a raise to a new level 
 And see the true devil 
 Any color ya wish because the devil takes any shape, 
 Any form 
 Any swarm 
 Ride over your dish like a picnic 
 I think the sick shit 
 I had my wrist slit 
 Like a suicide 
 But I survived 
 And you can too 
 Plan to 
 Live a full life free of anxieties 
 While you're at it try to keep an eye on me 
 The man with meditation skills 
 Wastin' spills, lyrical liquid 
 Fillin' streams 
 Wit' dreams 
 And I will cream whoever seems wicked 
 Oral floral arrangements 
 Is strange since 
 You don't have the comprehension 
 I will stop and lynch them 
 I'm not the one promotin' gun totin' 
 'Cause I contain within my brain these computations just as potent 
 The mental torturer of course you will acknowledge me 
 'Cause Mr. Twister places pictures, mental fixtures of photography 
 Shitty little bitties never get their clitties done, but I don't think 
 They'll resist 
 Mr. Twister 
 When I flex my verbal techs. 
 Exit 
 Mental anorexic 
 I don't cater to the imbecile so you can bet this 
 Is a brain buster 
 Pain thruster 
 Strain twister 
 Overwhelming pressure between the temples when I touch the microphone 
 I might condone 
 The usage of abuse if it is convenient 
 I slant and lean it 
 Like a lever when I leave ya mutilated 
 By my enuciated cleaver 
 I survived the ither and the either 
 Now let me take a breather 
 (Pause) 
 From my own little world, 
 Little girls, little boys 
 Stay free of hurries 
 Free of worries 
 That's riddle poised for posterity 
 Where are we 
 Goin' from here 
 As a ho 
 And I don't know 
 And that's the biggest feeaaar 
 When I'm flippin' into daaarknesss 
 Now I'm askin' can I spark this? 
 It's D-E-L y'all 
 From Hieroglyphics y'all 
 Sayin' peeeeace...
