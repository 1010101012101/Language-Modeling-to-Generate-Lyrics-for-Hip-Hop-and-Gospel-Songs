Soopa Feen he used to gleam and glow 
 Before he became a fiend for blow, unredeemable 
 I seen him go insane 
 Straight from cocaine, graduated to no brain 
 He went from Polo's to no name 
 Pawned everything even his gold chain 
 Now his skin is dingy, he be singeing 
 His lips on a glass tube and pass on food 
 His ass all glued to the seat of his pants 
 Got cuts and hella puss on his feet and his hands 
 Completely entranced, give this nigga a face wipe 
 Before he meet his contact, commissioner base pipe 
 For new assignments, 'cause he said it don't taste right 
 He used to cop that hop, so his face might look familiar to some 
 And now your boy's plumb dumb 
 Running around the slums, sticking his tongue out at young females 
 He sees trails, he think they're aliens 
 He starts bellin' in the precinct his feet stink 
 They throw him in the clink, 'cause he 5150 
 He got his Garfield and Otey beach towel for his cape 
 And safety pin he use to clean the screen 
 (I was feeeen before I became a teen) 
 Now he's a vigilante on Delancey 
 Then ran to Chancellor looking for his counselor 
 (His trusty sidekick Faultor!) for an ounce or a sack at least 
 (Well, crack the hash and peep and then it's back to sleep) 
 Well actually he got the master keys 
 More practices in the crack cave where they got a factory 
 Soopa Feen is skinny can slide through small areas 
 For quick getaways while Faultor pull the Derringer 
 That's his ace, shiesty as fuck 
 His specialty is gafflin niggas, extorting their bucks 
 His best power, the invisible gank 
 If in your wallet there isn't no bank 
 He contacts Soopa Feen with telepathy 
 Saying, "you need crack man, I need amphetamines" 
 He's faster than a speed trip, stronger than a nigga on 'ron 
 He think he a superhero, he just gone 
 He can't really fly but uses a harness 
 To leap tall building in his undergarments 
 His teeth are tarnished, he was banished from Berkely 
 Now he's up in North Oakland looking really perky 
 Never think he's jerky, but he really is 
 He plays with the neighborhood kids with fizz 
 Coming out the sides of his mouth 
 Sometimes he hides in the house devises new routes 
 So he could be up and out if he see po po 
 If he stalk ya while ya jaywalking looking very awkward 
 He don't stay far from the corner where they slang caine 
 He got the mega migrane sort of like his spider sense 
 That he can't fight against 
 Me I'd rather light a spliff, that's as high as I can get 
 But Soopa Feen is super human, he got the crystal lungs 
 From the planet base with cream will get you sprung 
 And niggas wanna beat your ass for all the shit you done 
 But you fight crime in your own special way 
 When you in the holding tank and other fiends won't let you get your way 
 You never catch a case cause your slick 
 High beams projecting, but you're never caught with shit
