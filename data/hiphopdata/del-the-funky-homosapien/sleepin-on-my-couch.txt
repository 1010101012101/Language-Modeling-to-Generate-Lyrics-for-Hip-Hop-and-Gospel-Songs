It seems nowadays friends step to me bogus 
 And end up on my couch at night without notice 
 It's cool to have a friend over every now and then 
 But I gotta have my space 
 And I don't wanna see their face 
 Like every single day of the week 
 Talk is cheap 
 You betta find yourself another place to sleep 
 It ain't my fault that ya moms got fed up 
 And now you wanna come to my crib and wet my bed up 
 You better find a job so you can get an apartment 
 And you can save your crocodile tears 
 Don't even start 
 With the sob stories 
 I got enough from the other seven brothas 
 In the den playin' Genesis 
 Damn I can't win at this 
 Seems like I'm gonna have to flip 
 And tell those other brothas 
 That they're gonna have to skip 
 I've had it up to here with these lazy cats 
 Sleepin' on my couch and I'm tired of that 
 People come to my house 
 And kinda wonder where the squadron's at 
 They're not gone 
 They're just down at the laundrymat 
 Because they wear the same pairs of clothing 
 I'm taking up crazy patience just holding 
 My temper 
 I'm about to start charging rent for 
 Every single brother 
 That kicked it with my mother eating biscuits 
 On Saturday morning like a family 
 The minute they step 
 It's like moms is crazy mad at me 
 'Cause they're in my mother's room watching television 
 I feel like giving 'em the boot 
 And say the hell with 'em 
 But if I give 'em the boot 
 I'm not a friend though 
 Even though my room 
 Smells like dime bags of indo but 
 I can't pretend like I haven't been peepin' it 
 Even mom knows that my brothas been sleepin' 
 On my couch for weeks 
 So your speeches fall flat 
 Sleepin' on my couch and I'm tired of that 
 Maybe this was just my upbringing perhaps 
 But I was taught that I shouldn't 
 Take seven day naps 
 At other brothas' cribs like I don't have a home 
 Brothas on my couch so much there's like foam 
 Coming out the seams 
 And a pair of jeans is missing from my closet 
 I wonder why I even bother being friendly 
 They're running my ass like the Indy 5000 
 They went and wrinkled my mother's blouse 
 When they snuck downstairs 
 For a midnight snack 
 And ate the last slice of bread 
 And a box of apple jacks 
 Then they hit the sack 
 With the stereo blastin' 
 And even little Tyson is fed up 
 So I'm askin' 
 You all to jet 
 Before I get upset 
 And throw each and every one 
 Of you bums out on your back 
 My house is a mess 
 So step ya little pest 
 Who was sleepin' on my couch 'cause I'm tired of that
