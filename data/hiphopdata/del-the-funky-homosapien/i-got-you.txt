 In my own words said you slightly drunken vertigo Single source transportation to your ego Skribble it till you skitzo or whatever I pop a tissue soft, keep ahead of the weather Magic mountain got my head right Step light, pop pure not a pesticide in sight Certified organic like I'm melanin right You panic in a scurry Drop dead from the scurvy Now I'm looking at somebody with grief With omega threes and sixes, nines can't divide we Del do it for the folks and such Crappy rappers choking in the smoke he emote Left them with star dust, star struck face Embrace my feminine energy pace and clutch this 'Cause I got you tight as what, you got me?

 With my own words send you further backwards/ Tractor beams catcha backhand the pastor That's blasphemous well who the hell asked you Mecca's whole directive is to hand down the chapter I'm flying off the rafters Silencers and magnumsNo not handguns markers for taggin Barnstorming your coordinates like dragons Fuck who your fam is They famish from famine I love to see that I'm off the meat rack I kick my feet back and listen to the beat slap Mecca got your teeth wrapped around her kneecap Trying to beat that Rocks beat scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beat rock We got you in the box, like a fiend in detox Rebelling against the empire like the Ewoks.
