Back in the saddle with some ammo for you 
 Rattlesnakes who believe you immortal 
 Told y'all pulling ya hoe card before you bogard and overflow 
 I'll assure you know there is two sides you hide foolish pride every time you high side and storm through 
 Watch it that's the topic I'm talking 
 You thoughtless so walk with no caution 
 Stop it because you pop shit so often/ its toxic 
 Just like a jock itch obnoxious 
 Think you God's gift but you not a bit 
 Like your comments your not the bomb drop it 
 When you start your engines I'm cringing 
 Then intentionally I don't listen 
 I hear you just the same just distance all of my conscious thought or attention 
 Your lip service serves no purpose 
 Ain't even real its just your invention 
 Chorus (repeat 2x) 
 No nonsense it's straight up and down 
 This is how it is, the way it goes down 
 It don't slow down get on the boat now 
 Nothing to doubt, it's straight up and down 
 That's how I'm calling it, top to bottom is my attitude, you can't fuck around 
 You need to try heed the procedure And stop trying to leap ahead like you the leader Or you the boss because you ain't either You off the meter/ please take a breather Think you foxy but see I see So you wanna mock me But it's all theatre/ you don't know so don't throw me in that bag of average hokey pokies No need Soon as you try a okey dokey Don't be shocked to find yourself both feet touching clouds back on the ground You're much too proud Your whole style is revolting Insulting you clown my intelligence As if things you say have any relevance Just beef cause you say it with eloquence That's just game, it's stanking, I'm smelling it You are not the truth you are feeling inadequate adding your embellishments 
 No nonsense it's straight up and down 
 This is how it is, the way it goes down 
 It don't slow down get on the boat now 
 Nothing to doubt, it's straight up and down 
 That's how I'm calling it, top to bottom is my attitude, you can't fuck around 
 Game peep game So ain't nothing going over my head You may as well notice it's all in your head You show it with boldness Even though I know you think I don't know this You got weak game everything you speak change tune As soon as you say it 
 That 's bogus Don't trip you see that way is low risk I say there's no gold without no risk Oh shit, but you know this you just think you so slick you can just go over it What do it take to finally wake you up Feel this and bet it's sobering 
 Chorus (repeat 4x) 
 No nonsense it's straight up and down 
 This is how it is, the way it goes down 
 It don't slow down get on the boat now 
 Nothing to doubt, it's straight up and down 
 That's how I'm calling it, top to bottom is my attitude, you can't fuck around
