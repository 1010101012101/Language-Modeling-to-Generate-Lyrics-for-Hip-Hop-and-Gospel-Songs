Full of cobras, yolla, dosia stands Soldiers roll as hoes come to hold your hand What they told ya is bogus, motive scams Payola for motorolas and coco plants Ask the bitch why you attracted to a older man If you play you better know your hand They be po-po fans Loco in the cabeza Possessive, no questions Hoe sexes for yo necklace Self esteem low Pimps get the green dough Extreme show of gratitude for slapping you I'ma rapper with actual facts for you Look at that, that's what crack will do, zappin fools Make the most attractive boo turn transient Lost in the ambience pantiless, scantily dressed She like give me a kiss, a price for pimps with a pantry of flesh for your cash But it can't be a check 
 Niggas be so damn slow man, I told them man 
 No one's gonna hold your hand 
 I don't know why niggas be so damn slow man, I told them man 
 No one's gonna hold your hand 
 I don't why niggas be so damn slow man, I told them man 
 No one's gonna hold yo hand 
 I don't know why niggas be so damn slow man 
 I ain't mesmerized by a pleasure promise with lies It won't twist my brain if a bitch complain I'ma analyze wisely the situations, see if shit you saying is warranted If so, I'll more than give my all to correct any flaws If you in denial, by hoe I can't hold your hand, you're tool old for that I don't know them cats Should I order straps? She'll be blowing sacks but you owe'm scratch and its extra weed Niggas trying to threaten me Why they sweating me? I even let them eat, now they wanna catch me sleep Fat chance Now my hands holding Ammo loaded Slamming voltage to shock Einstein'sWhen the fine line is crossed A blind mind with thoughts to real to concoct That's them, action Make something happen
