Salutations now you're facing a real nigga D-E-L, I don't feel bigger Up here on stage man I keep it real witcha I'm here to entertain y'all, let's play ball I stay raw as coke flawless flows A novice can't recall why his jaw is broke Trying to borrow quotes, that his problem folks, we all adults Let's see how long he floats Against the barrage of assaults dislodge his throat Send death charges to carve his boat in the cart to Oakland to all my folks Del apart from most He hard with jokes Target scoped and I don't care how far he go And the bitch is a party ho Ain't hardly no debutante she give head for ones You said I read you wrong and your head get stomped

 Yo, D that stands for dangerous Never rearrange my stuff to sell units Niggas do it then you can't come back again Del is busy mastering all the styles of black music, 'cause I'm attracted to it Then add rap to it through hip hop movement Get ya groovin' spit raw sewage Miss y'all foolish hoes Live my life on cruise control stay level headed Plus, I got the devil's legend So, I'm scopin' the scene Like metal detection, dental infection, alized erection keep shitting perspective So, I don't misinterpret a word sent to my auditory canal My memory works like storing a file Always supporting my pals and that's more important than thousands of dollars or drowning in sorrow if I'm around tomorrow There's a chance to advance to the spot that I feel is proper to stop at Examine my work understand I how I work Make sure my structure's solid which is up to knowledge, education Charlatan's have no patience, show irrational behaviorGetting trapped with paper and that's the danger
