Yeah! I go by the name of Cassidy! 
 I'm gonna sing a rap song about violence, cause that's what I see. 
 I mean everybody's violent, 
 And sometimes I'm even violent in my soul, 
 Violence is at the all-time high 
 But sometimes I get high and just imagine 
 What if the Earth was at peace? 
 Imagine if you never had to box no more, 
 Never had to use your gun and run from cops no more, 
 You can stop the violence, stop the war, 
 No more beef on the street, 
 I'm talking about peace. 
 Imagine that you would never had to fight no more, 
 Never had to take your life and take a life no more, 
 And you could stop the violence, stop the war 
 No more beef on the street, 
 I'm talking about peace. 
 Every day I try to imagine, but can't fight them, 
 A world with no?, and no shoot, and no stabbing, 
 Cause people were evil, since Eve and Adam, 
 Make Abel and Cain, so it's not gonna be able to change, 
 I'll let you know and I'll never get bad, you know, 
 If you try and leave in peace you can all go to heaven, yo 
 If you're trying to live in peace, you gotta do the hard thing, you know? 
 You'll never know where you're going, you gotta die,? 
 But some guys are worse than others, 
 I think God?.you should try church, 
 If you got faith, that's how God work, 
 You still comprehend the Lord if you buy work, 
 And buy guns 'cause we're still God's sons. 
 Imagine if you never had to box no more, 
 Never had to use your gun and run from cops no more, 
 You can stop the violence, stop the war, 
 No more beef on the street, 
 I'm talking about peace. 
 Imagine that you would never had to fight no more, 
 Never had to take your life and take a life no more, 
 And you could stop the violence, stop the war 
 No more beef on the street, 
 I'm talking about peace. 
 Why is it war, why is it hatred, 
 We need it, that's the reason why Satan was created. 
 Moses was a murderer but he was God's favorite, 
 My gun goes straight off but prayers still pay off 
 Imagine if Adolf never discriminated, 
 And Martin Luther King was never assassinated, 
 Imagine if Malcolm X would have made it, 
 And Nelson Mandela was never incarcerated, 
 America was never segregated, 
 And crooks like George W. Bush never graduated. 
 Some kids look at gangsta movies and their fascinated, 
 And try to do the same shit or some lame shit. 
 Imagine if you never had to box no more, 
 Never had to use your gun and run from cops no more, 
 You can stop the violence, stop the war, 
 No more beef on the street, 
 I'm talking about peace. 
 Imagine that you would never had to fight no more, 
 Never had to take your life and take a life no more, 
 And you could stop the violence, stop the war 
 No more beef on the street, 
 I'm talking about peace. 
 I'm from a hood where good Niggers die too much, 
 I'm from a block where they would be popping off the?too much, 
 People crying too much, from the stress they see, 
 We got to make a change and we got to make it A.S.A.P 
 No, I ain't graduated, take the S.A.T, 
 But I knew right from wrong when I was writing this song. 
 Even the strongest men have the right to be wrong, 
 And the weakest men might become strong. 
 Imagine if you never had to box no more, 
 Never had to use your gun and run from cops no more, 
 You can stop the violence, stop the war, 
 No more beef on the street, 
 I'm talking about peace. 
 Imagine that you would never had to fight no more, 
 Never had to take your life and take a life no more, 
 And you could stop the violence, stop the war 
 No more beef on the street, 
 I'm talking about peace.
