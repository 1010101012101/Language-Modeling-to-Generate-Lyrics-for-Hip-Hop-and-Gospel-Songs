Night niggaz need 2 get they mind rite 
 2 get signed niggaz probably take they mom life 
 Things people do just 2 get in the rhyme life 
 But they each your zone 
 It is what it is 
 Man understand this 
 Their is a big difference between advantage and avanquish 
 The alogo and the mercialago 
 I ain't gotta lie yo 
 It is what it is 
 If you see me wit some niggaz they all grimy 
 I put time in time diamonds all shiny 
 Paid a 100 grand for a chain that cost 90 
 And let them keep the change 
 It is what it is 
 And every song niggaz doin' the work 
 Talkin' about a million niggaz that they willin' 2 murk 
 But how many niggaz you gon kill in a verse 
 U gotta convince me dog 
 It is what it is 
 My squad luv me 'cause I don't ride dick 
 U gotta keep it real wit the niggaz you ride wit 
 Ladies luv me 'cause I'm cool as todd smith 
 So hide yo chick 
 It is what it is 
 If u a skinny woman than that's thorough 
 But if uz a big woman I got ur back girl 
 Fuck all them niggaz that consider you fat girl 
 U ain't gotta lose weight 
 It is what it is 
 All I'm makin' is more hits 
 But I was drunk wen I came in2 the booth 2 record this 
 Swizz sed cass you gotta think of the chorus 
 But I don't need no hook 
 It is what it is 
 My worse verse hot as ur best rhyme 
 Damn I can't think of the next line 
 But fuck it ill remember it next time 
 'Cause I'm compressed for time 
 It is what it is 
 These fake niggaz would strait front 
 I did 2 county bids but ain't been upstate once 
 For a murder charge I only did 8 months 
 My lawyer the truth 
 It is what it is 
 U ain't gotta like it but you gotta respect it 
 Theirs things in the past that you upset wit 
 But I woundnt change nuttin I don't regret shit 
 We all make mistakes 
 It is what it is 
 Cause government don't do shit for u 
 But send you to war man they tryin' to destroy u 
 The president tryin' 2 get to all u 
 He worse than sadam 
 It is what it is 
 They should put my picture next 2 the definition of hip hop 
 But I'm not getting no recognition from dick jocks 
 Even sum of the best ammiting that my shit hot 
 Beside nas I'm the best that did it next 2 big ah 
 Niggaz ain't want it pun he did it big 
 Pac was 1 of the best so give that kid props 
 Rakim & g-rap them niggaz all that 
 If you ain't ll or that nigga jigga den fall back 
 I'm true 2 dis I ain't new 2 dis I do this shit 
 If you ain't snoop kiss or ludacris 
 Den you get dissed 
 Dis cass I don't care if you niggaz mad 
 If you ain't my nigga fab I'll get in dat ass 
 U ain't x or sp don't test me 
 If you ain't nelly or joe crack 
 U no latch 
 U ain't nore or sheech louch 
 Ur weak dude 
 If he ain't busta or b-mack 
 Den he wack 
 If he ain't wayne or flip dog 
 They shit soft 
 Shane eve lil kim 
 They chick soft 
 I been fuckin' wit jd since kriss kross 
 Except me, chris tip and rick ross 
 Any nigga outass, 
 Wit juve and outkast 
 Wit dipset and bone thugs 
 Get shown luv 
 A lotta niggaz talk greasy in dey rhymez 
 But if you ain't jeezy or reakon 
 Den stay calm 
 Caus the role niggaz playin' iz fake 
 If you ain't game or kanye den start playin' the safe 
 Any thing I say now ill say in ur face 
 So that's that 
 Stay in ur place 
 It is what it is
