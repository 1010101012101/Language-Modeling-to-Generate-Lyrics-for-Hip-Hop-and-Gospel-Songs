 [Mashond:] What a beautiful day 
 [Swizz Beatz:] Start up the engine

 We can drive or walk 
 Baby we can fly 
 Aslong as you take me away

 And when I land you should be standing there with the keys in your hand 
 Then we ridin' in the six Fo' 
 You my chick so 
 All them other chicks I was with, can call it quits yo 
 You the chick I with yo 
 And I don't like to kiss 
 But Aytime we kiss, I can't let your lips go

 I'm selling on Swizz yaught 
 You know I get gwapt 
 I can spend about house money just on a wrist watch 
 So you know my chick hot 
 And got a nice face 
 But she got a tight waste 
 She in tip-top 
 Shape 
 But still thick like Rib-top 
 Without effort, she break records like a Disk Jock 
 Shawty 'bout to get got 
 'Cause she hard as nails 
 She that broad, it ain't hard to tell 
 Well me and shawty live life 
 Then I took her to bed 
 And before she fell to sleep, I said 
 Girl I love you more then hip-hop 
 You a women, or wife 
 I think I finally met a women I like 
 Righttt 
 Can we take a trip 
 Baby I don't mind 
 There we go, aslong as your all mine 
 We can drive or walk

 Aslong as you take me away 
 I'll be makin' you say 
 Uh My, Oh My 
 Baby don't stop, daddy you'll be making me say 
 Ah Ah, UH Ah 
 La, La, La, La, La, LA, La 
 The ball Cas' serious 
 Are you hearing this 
 Are you hearing this 
 Are you hearing this 
 She'd be delirious of the experience 
 Cause' I'm a straight thug that know how to make love 
 If she ain't on her period 
 Then I'm getting it done 
 I gotta let her feel the tip of the tongue 
 Then ride out like a chariot 
 So even if I'm gone 
 She can't forget about the trip we was on 
 Cum'on 
 Can we take a trip 
 Baby I don't mind 
 There we go, aslong as your all mine 
 We can drive or walk 
 Baby we can fly 
 Aslong as you take me away 
 I'll be makin' you say 
 Uh My, Oh My 
 Baby don't stop, daddy you'll be making me say 
 Ah Ah, UH Ah 
 La, La, La, La, La, LA, La

 And all your hearin' is 
 All your hearin' is, all your hearin' is 
 Flyin in the G-Fo' 
 And all your hearin' is 
 All your hearin' is, all your hearin' is
