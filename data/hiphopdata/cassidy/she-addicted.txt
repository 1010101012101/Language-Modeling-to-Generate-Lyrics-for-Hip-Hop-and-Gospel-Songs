 Cassidy: 
 I was driving down Nice town to pick up Keyshia 
 And I almost crashed when I passed this chick named Rachel 
 She ain't have a ring on her finger but really faithful to some big willy 
 But I'm really getting cake too 
 Mami a hotty gotta body and a face too but she tasteful I could probly give her felatial 
 She had a ass that'll probly intimidate you 
 But I called her like Rachel come her don't make me chase you 
 She stopped and said Cass I always wanted to date you since the hotel video I wanted to rape you 
 Boy I wanna taste you 
 I said well we leaving and I took her to the top floor of the 4 seasons and got right,

 If I'm your best friend you could get diamonds and a man 
 But Pam say she'd rather have diamonds then a man 
 And she'd rather use the rabbit than put time in with a man 
 Nalia Boss:

 Cassidy:
