 (Mashonda singing hook) 
 So many nights I felt like crying, can't get you off my mind, 
 All this time I felt like dying, your so hard to find 
 So I, gotta move on, 
 Guess I, gotta stay strong, 
 And I, gotta keep it goin', so long, so long 
 (Cassidy) 
 Its usually the beauty that attracts me, 
 But perhaps she was the rite person, 
 Her personality made me happy, 
 And that's why I pursued her, 
 I'm a dude that makes manuvers, 
 If I chose her than she's whipped 'cause my dick as long as a ruler, 
 She may be kind of crazy, 
 Its cool as long as I school her, 
 I'm smooth as grand puba and I can charm a computer, 
 For us to conversate all it takes to make an impression, 
 Like a teacher lecturing, 
 When I speak, she taking lessons, 
 But every time we argue and fight I feel like I'm dying, 
 I feel like crying, 
 To tell you the truth you feel like I'm lying, 
 But Ima move longer and stronger as ever without you, 
 I could do better, but I could never forget about you girl

 Ay yo, I laced you with the girl braclets when you were young, 
 Doing your thing you want the M5 I buy you the buinesses, 
 Queen of the temple with the scent of a lemon, 
 All of the linnen, 
 Shit at the time I'm just reserving your? 
 With all that long hair, 
 Sexy wear, Walk in your von gear, 
 We at the palm, you all up under my arm wear, 
 We shopping, embracing you with locks and glocks, 
 And tims, flying from Africa yo back to the block, 
 You just a siddolger, that's why your ones is ozzed up, 
 'Cause when I needed you, you never get frozzed up, 
 A laced out lady with taste, 
 I gotta just kiss your face, 
 Keep your nigga grounded, these are the brakes, one...

 Without us being close its depressing, 
 They say nobody perfect, 
 But honey-roasted complection is close to perfection, 
 Plus she gotta body that could prolly turn a gay man straight, 
 To stay in shape mammi started taking karate, 
 So while she get it in the gym running the treadmill, 
 I'm running from feds still, 
 Keep one in the head still, 
 I be remenicen boo, 
 Missing you, that's being real 
 'Cause you nice in the bed and you nice with the head skills, 
 You awfly fine, 
 I can't get you off my mind, 
 I ain't frontin yeah I lost it dime, 
 But you crossed the line and ain't follow directions, 
 You gone, getting back togethers out of the question, 
 I moved on...
