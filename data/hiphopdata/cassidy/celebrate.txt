(Feat. John Legend) 
 (Intro and rapping: Cassidy) 
 I used to pump dimes, now I spit punchlines 
 I'm tired of cats tryin' to rap 'cause they want shine 
 I be writing to enlighten those that was once blind 
 This political warfare, and I'm on the front line 
 I'm a soldier who grew to be a general, but generals is soldiers too (true) 
 And I'm willing to do what soldiers do, but you know an animal can't control a zoo (uh uh) 
 And I always been a leader, I control my crew. You gotta school other dudes tryin' to roll with you. 
 And I'm getting more mature, I'm gettin' older too, but I'mma rock till it's over like Hova do. 
 And I don't tell lies like most of you, I really did sell piles, held toasters too. 
 I might exaggerate a little but it's mostly true, and the truth come to the light like it's supposed to do. 
 Get the obituary ready, get the Reverend, my old style died, and went to punchline heaven. 
 You cats know that that's my flow, I'm a legend, big up John Legend for doing the song. 
 Ay, wanwan Kayne, I ain't a Juvenile, but I been on the grind-yee, I had a murder case, 
 I was facin some time-yee, but that's somethin' small to a giant like Andre, 
 And they was talkin' 'bout givin' me life, y'all but I knew I was leavin' for belivin' in Christ, 
 Y'all, you could live it up, but don't give up the fight, y'all, we elevatin, so we celebratin' the night, y'all. 
 Hang on lil' girl, soon all your troubles will be gone lil' girl, sometimes you probably wish you wasn't born lil' girl, 
 But God know what he doin', lil' girl (uh huh), so keep fightin. 
 And hang on lil' man, you can't quit now, keep goin' lil' man, sometimes you probably wish you wasn't born lil' man, 
 But God know what he doin' lil' man (uh huh), so keep fightin.
