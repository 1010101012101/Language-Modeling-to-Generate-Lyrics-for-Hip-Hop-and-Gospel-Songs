 My shoes see through like a kat scan up in here 
 Yeah im gettin high puttin grams in the air 
 Got my eyes looking like im from japan up in here 
 I brought a couple grand up in here 
 And my ice shine so bright you might catch a tan up in here 
 Im an ape. and my man is a bear 
 So i aint scared of none of yal standin in here 
 Mami i aint your man or that man in your ear 
 But i want you to understand 
 Im the man up in here 
 Im back with the (drumma drumma drumma bass) 
 Snares and high hats 
 Yeah im back up in the place 
 You can hate it so good in the hood im great 
 I was never fake 
 Early like ive never been late 
 Im never sober. smoking marijuana to the face 
 Sippin some champagne you probly never get to taste 
 Cuz you cant afford it. if you order by the case 
 For the watch i paid a quarter 
 Frozen water in the face 
 I know its a recession and a lot of people down 
 But imma keep to pushin 
 I aint got a bush to beat around 
 Im with some freak i found, 
 Dancin with my hands on her hips 
 Imma take her home and let her dance up on my dick 
 Listen Im on a mission to get richer and richer 
 My life like a movie 
 But you aint getin the picture 
 Gotta get the money 
 Then get what money will get ya 
 Cuz when you gone god aint lettin you bring it with ya 
 I wish i could rewind time and be young again 
 Take it back to when cats was dancin havin fun again 
 And get it jumpin like house party one again 
 If u aint dancin U aint comin in. 
 Sorry
