Yeah, I need to talk to you, ok can I talk to you 
 C'mon c'mon c'mon (hey, let me holla at you) 
 C'mon c'mon c'mon (yo, stop runnin' from me) 
 (Cassidy) 
 A yo this Cassidy and niggas is not fuckin' wit me man, 
 And yeah, I'm talking wreckless but you gotta respect it, 
 Its in my DNA man, I was born to be a gangsta, 
 Yeah Kiss talk to em' 
 (Jadakiss) 
 You know me K-I-S-S kiss of death 
 LP soon comin' for y'all bless bless 
 Metallic green paint on the impala the S.S. 
 And I figure the more niggas dead the less stress 
 You love how I'm hurtin' the track 
 You wanna polly but I'm sort of hard to reach like the dirt on ya back 
 Hand to hand like I'm workin the sack 
 And I work out wit my arms so I'll have no problem workin the mac 
 Uh, never been a toe stepper, side switcher 
 A fence jumper, I was 10 wit twin pumpers 
 Hustled wit the best of them 
 Did whatever it took to make a quarter I charge niggas to watch wrestlin 
 I'm heavy threat, D-Block double R full surface y'all niggas ain't ready yet 
 (Talking) 
 Yeah, New York is mine, Philly is Cass holla back. 
 (Cassidy) 
 You know me C-A-S-S fresh dressed 
 Just copped some new 4-5's and a fresh vest 
 I gets scout 'cause a bitch mouth is the best sex 
 But less tlk you ain't got no heart in yo left breast 
 Go head get yo beef on 
 I'll let my wolves get they eat on and leave you wit nothing but ya sneaks on 
 But it don't matter 'cause ya feets gone 
 Now that's restin in pieces so go meet Jesus 
 You little boys better ease up 
 'Cause them dudes you think hot'll see Cass and then freeze up 
 You wan' scrap roll ya sleeves up 
 But I'll rather squeeze 'cause I ain't tryin' to fuck my trees up 
 Or wrinkle my dickie I crack a dutch sprinkle the sticky 
 I know you pissed I got kiss and them wit me, dig me 
 'Cause you dudes is haters and if you bet that I was gon' flop you gon' lose yo paper. 
 (Jada) 
 A yo, get it through ya head there's no stopping me 
 Nigga the R is double the surface is full the block is D 
 All it take is a trey 8 & a mass nigga its Jada and Cass I vision ya face waitin to blast 
 If money was food y'all niggas be fastin 
 And we stuffin our face and eatin wit passion 
 In the hood like we runnin' numbers 
 Cass ask these mothafuckas why they runnin' from us 
 (Cassidy) 
 They runnin' from us 'cause they petrified 
 I lift guns for the exercise 
 And I spray like insecticides 
 You bugs better rcognize 
 When the weapon rise you can catch slugs in ya chest through ya vest and die 
 You on some sucka shit 
 So I'll leave a scar on ya face longer than the knife that I cut you wit 
 I done paid my dues so I'll blow ya brains out and then feed it to ya seed like baby food 
 Bitch!
