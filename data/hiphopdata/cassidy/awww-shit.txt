Cassidy verse- aw shit 
 Its money on my damn mind like every damn day like all the damn time 
 And I be broke if I never wrote all them damn rhymes 
 Cook coke had good smoke and sold all them damn dimes 
 My neck and my hand shine 
 My watch got so many rocks in the face I be late all damn time 
 And I'm the damn bomb bout to blow like a landmine 
 I'm paid in full like cam'ron on my damn grind 
 I got awards 
 Rows full of clothes you can't find 
 'Cause I ball you just go in the mall and stand in line 
 The way you shoppin' is childish get a stylist 
 A rapper ain't talk this slick since chris wallace 
 I'm the king of rock 
 I never lived in hollace 
 But I'm in the kitchen whippin' till my finger get a callus 
 Yeah I got what you need to hear (hair) like bald people all y'all people know I'm fly like a bald eagle 
 Aw shit
