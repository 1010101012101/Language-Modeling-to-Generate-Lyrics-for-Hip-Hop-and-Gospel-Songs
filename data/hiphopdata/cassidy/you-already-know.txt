(Feat. Beanie Sigel, Fabolous and Swizz Beatz) 
 Cassidy: 
 Cass and Beans you bitch ass niggas 
 Philly pistol bangin' we gon make'em pay 
 Beans: 
 You already know (you already know) 
 It's the boss of all bosses 
 Well repected, reputation flawless 
 Street record, no losses 
 Movie on my life it's a toss up between spike and tarentino 
 Well connected like Nicodemo 
 Skinny Joey, uh, come on you niggas know me 
 Capo de cape need work get at me 
 One four deuce in amsterdam 
 Cassidy: 
 Ask ya man 
 Beans: 
 I'm on the hill all day, gettin' it the long way 
 Hicks on broadway call me poppy (?) 
 Now move bitch 
 Cassidy: 
 Get out the way, ay 
 Da hustla home I know the game missin' me (Come on Cass) 
 Me and B Mac on the track, (Beans) the game history 
 Picture me lettin these bitch niggas get to me 
 You could use my life to write a murder mystery 
 And my fist a lil crystally 
 My watch on freeze I got more cheese than lil Italy (Philly stand up) 
 And you ain't got a coin, ya checks go boing 
 I get change, big chain hang to my groin 
 And I could go to the car lot in a hard top 
 And pull another coupe off jag wit the soft top 
 I'mma take the roof off I don't do the sun roofs 
 And I chrome the boots off dawg I got dumb loot 
 Yo Mac tell'em how hard niggas go 
 Beans: 
 It's State pen, foster fest 
 They already know 
 You got beef than watch ya back 
 You already know 
 Stand up niggas never act yo 
 You already know 
 You gotta keep ya enemies close 
 You already know 
 And neva leave home without toast 
 You already know 
 Real niggas do what they want 
 You already know 
 Bitch niggas do what you told 
 You already know 
 You gotta play the hand you was dealt 
 You already know 
 Two real niggas livin' by the code man 
 You already know 
 Beans: 
 You niggas already know how me and Cass get down 
 Cassidy: 
 Nigga ask around 
 Beans: 
 Shit we'll lay a nigga casket down 
 Cassidy: 
 Man I'll grab the ruger smoke'em like a bag of buddha 
 Beans: 
 Naw Cass just throw'em off the roof 
 Cassidy: 
 Like a parachuter 
 Beans: 
 Yeah lets see if he gon land on his face or his feet 
 Cassidy: 
 But Mac I could just take the heat put his face on the street 
 Beans: 
 Or you could take the back of the gat try breakin his teeth 
 Cassidy: 
 Or I could hit'em wit the piece that could wake the decease 
 I'll call the chopper 
 Earthquakin be shakin the street (what else) 
 I touch ki's I push bass like I'm makin' the beat (you already know) 
 Beans: 
 Slow down Cass ya killin'em 
 Take it easy on'em 
 Cassidy: 
 Naw Mac I'm not feelin'em 
 Beans: 
 Well fuck it, it's Mac and Cass 
 Back-to-back like Mac and Brad 
 Fuck these fake as rappers half these niggas fags 
 Designer back packs, tight clothes dressed in drag 
 Cassidy: 
 Tried to hop up on the track look like extra swag 
 Beans/Cassidy: 
 I'm the truth in the booth 
 Mac could bust that ass 
 Cass a best on the beat 
 Yeah I'll crush that ass 
 Faboulus: 
 And I'm fa sho wit the flow (Who that?) 
 Ghetto fab (F-A B-O) 
 I keep the meter on the dash like the yellow cab 
 Wings on the hood, b's on the pedal tabs 
 It's Bentley Beans then it's Continental Cass 
 Flyin spur Fabo on the collabo 
 I'm like zab-do when I let the jab go 
 In the lab yo word players like scrabbo 
 Cassidy: 
 Yo Fabo you ain't bad with the vocab yo 
 I bag snow and blow strawberry dro 
 Cass it is what it is you already know 
 You already know [x4]
