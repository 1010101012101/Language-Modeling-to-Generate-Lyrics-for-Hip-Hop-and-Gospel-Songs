I always had dreams to live it up 
 Get a bigger crib, some bigger jewels, and a bigger truck 
 Patron in bigger cups, I'm smokin' a bigger dutch 
 If a bigga nigga trippin' da bigga nigga get touched 
 Da bigger dey are, da harder dey fall, and plus 
 Da bigger da gun, da louder da sound wen it buss 
 If I put a potato ova da hammer it'll hush 
 Times money, I'm tryna find money I'm ina rush 
 Life sucks, da wheel keep turnin' like double dutch 
 It's a struggle, but I'm still gon hustle, and double up 
 My whole life I stayed in some trouble but, 
 If nothing jumpin' off, den I'm startin some trouble up 
 (Nigga I don't give a fuck, And I don't give a fuck) 
 Never did, never will that's just how a nigga feel 
 (Nigga I don't give a fuck, And I don't give a fuck) 
 Never ran, never will ima have to get killed 
 (Nigga I don't give a fuck, And I don't give a fuck) [Times 3] 
 So I'm livin' my last like 
 (I don't give a fuck) 
 I always had dreams to make a mill 
 I fulfilled my dream, my new plan is to make a bill 
 And most of dese niggas fake, dey ain't real 
 Sumtin happen, dey start rattin and takin' deals 
 I got plastic gats I'm strapped 
 But I could still take a walk through da metal dector wearin da Heckler 
 If I catch a nigga tryna to apply pressure 
 I'm quick to lick a shot like REWIND SELECTOR 
 Like a rule boy, I play with the tool boy, 
 And I hear when you die ya body get cool boy 
 I rather win da war insteada makin' da news boy 
 I been hustlin I ain't got nothin' to prove boy 
 (Nigga I don't give a fuck, And I don't give a fuck) 
 Never did, never will that's just how a nigga feel 
 (Nigga I don't give a fuck, And I don't give a fuck) 
 Never ran, never will ima have to get killed 
 (Nigga I don't give a fuck, And I don't give a fuck) [Times 5] 
 So I'm livin' my last like 
 (I don't give a fuck) 
 I always had dreams of success 
 But I love music I don't just do this to get the check 
 And if I conversate with a chick ima get some sex 
 Even if it ain't da coochie I know ima get some neck, yes 
 I'm da best, I get money and get respect 
 I was just sittin' in jail callin niggas collect 
 But I still empty da clip of da gun if its drama 
 I don't give a fuck, dats on my son and my momma 
 (Nigga I don't give a fuck, And I don't give a fuck) 
 Never did, never will that's just how a nigga feel 
 (Nigga I don't give a fuck, And I don't give a fuck) 
 Never ran, never will ima have to get killed 
 (Nigga I don't give a fuck, And I don't give a fuck) [Times 5] 
 So I'm livin' my last like 
 (I don't give a fuck)
