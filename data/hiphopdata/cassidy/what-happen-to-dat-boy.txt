Its cassidy I push them pies 
 And i 
 Kiss da girls and make them cry i 
 Stay on da block I don't play on da block 
 I got yay by da k on da block 
 I'm out here everyday on da block 
 Puttin' white in da coffee like a cafe on da block 
 And ill let that thing spray on da block 
 For sing thing 
 2 bring da a.k on da block 
 Ugh 
 And if you try me get bodied clown 
 I push your grill to the side like bobby brown 
 Ugh 
 I heard they plottin to rob me now 
 'Cause I'm gettin' loot 
 Got more birds then a chicken coop 
 I got plenty gunz 
 I cop so many gunz I still got ones I ain't get to shoot 
 And I ripped da booth 
 Ill have ur whole group on my dick like"cass yo your shit da truth" 
 And I ain't ugly so I need a chick just as cute 
 Witta couple tats gap like a missin' tooth 
 What you ain't get da scoop 
 I'm dat same nigga on that bigga business beat before you get to snoop 
 Salute da general back 
 I keep a gat by my genitals 
 This criminal rap 
 I throw my young boi's mineral packs 
 And give them all identical gats hold dat 
 So when I start clappin at that boi 
 Da law never find out what happen to dat boi 
 Nigga
