 Krayzie Bone: 
 Niggas better listen to the warnin 
 Run up on a nigga he die

 Any nigga with a missunderstandin gone get handled

 You can get it in the street

 We want it, we need it you betta believe it 
 An if you ain't got it we gunnin mann 
 I ain't askin twice I never been that nice 
 No niggas been killed for a game of dice 
 He come short on the dept and he paid the price 
 Stayin at home with a safety light 
 Choose to gamble 
 Mista ramble 
 Nigga like that get made example

 Come short on the ddope

 Jus to cop me a dress
