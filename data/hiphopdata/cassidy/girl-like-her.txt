Dear baby, wassup witch? I really do wanna believe it, 
 But you know, so good I guess a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do 
 I mean you you couldn't just wait like 3 more days till I got back to town 
 I don't even understand 
 Should have known better, you went behind my back and you had to mess with something like that 
 My love grew to hatred, your love is not the... I've been rehabilitated 
 You had a real woman but you ain't appreciate it 
 Why you cheating on me with a girl like her 
 My love grew to hatred, I know you and me shouldn't be affiliated 
 I... really woman but enough of what I made it 
 Why you cheating on me with a girl like her 
 The first night was love at first sight 
 I liked you when I first saw you, when I first caught you 
 The first conversation was making my blood boil you 
 So now you gonna just spoil it in joy cause boy... you 
 You are beautiful rose that grew up on some bad soil 
 Any place anywhere, I don't care, I'm here for you 
 Them girlfriends you got, they really don't care for you 
 They just trying make up shit to ruin our relationship 
 But think about it, what they shout... they make it since 
 They just hatin' and try to break us up 
 But I won't take offence, they hurt... 
 They decide that to take the bitch, 
 But if I'm lying you can lock me up and take my keys 
 My love grew to hatred, your love is not the... I've been rehabilitated 
 You had a real woman but you ain't appreciate it 
 Why you cheating on me with a girl like her 
 My love grew to hatred, I know you and me shouldn't be affiliated 
 I... really woman but enough of what I made it 
 Why you cheating on me with a girl like her 
 I can lie, was a pimp, yeah I had a squad 
 That's why I never been married, never had a bride 
 But look ma, that was the past, you don't have to cry 
 You're financially stable when you're sexually satisfied 
 The ladies always be on my feast 
 But don't believe what they be putting on Twitter and MySpace 
 Why you hate me, cause a low rumor started? 
 Is you retarded, that's what they do to artists 
 I'm the hottest rapper out the mother duds garbage 
 That's why the ladies love me but I want you regardless 
 The girl they say I'm cheating with I ain't sleeping with 
 The media say I'm tripping with... girl 
 My love grew to hatred, your love is not the... I've been rehabilitated 
 You had a real woman but you ain't appreciate it 
 Why you cheating on me with a girl like her 
 My love grew to hatred, I know you and me shouldn't be affiliated 
 I... really woman but enough of what I made it 
 Why you cheating on me with a girl like her 
 And now I understand if you just wasn't ready 
 But all you had to do is just be honest and tell me 
 That you needed some time, tell me space you... and have fun 
 Why did you take into eat or two? 
 It's not the fact you cheated, it's the fact with who 
 That's why I'm so heated, now I was so disappointed when I finally seen it 
 My love grew to hatred, your love is not the... I've been rehabilitated 
 You had a real woman but you ain't appreciate it 
 Why you cheating on me with a girl like her 
 My love grew to hatred, I know you and me shouldn't be affiliated 
 I... really woman but enough of what I made it 
 Why you cheating on me with a girl like her
