Yo wassup you know who it is 
 Cass the kid Cassidy and I'm 
 Here to talk real to you unlike 
 These other mcs check it out 
 Yo I'm the realest cat you done ever met so when I get a check 
 For this next album that's out 
 Y'all one really find out what the 
 Problems about yeah I still got 
 Problems about but nothing I'm 
 Not used to mad 'cause I do it 
 Better then you do shoot 
 Compared to me your stuff sound 
 Boo boo And I done matered my 
 Craft both rap and blastin the mac 
 Ain't no actin' in Cass I'm as real 
 As can be and all the real cats 
 Out there feel me so you gone have to kill me to make me quit 
 Talkin' about it you ain't hard you 
 Just the one barkin the loudest 
 You starvin to have it that's what 
 I got 'cause see the market is madness and cats like me are 
 Hard to find but to me it comes 
 Easy it ain't hard to rhyme 
 I done had my share of hard times 
 But now its time to shine 'cause 
 It's my time in the limelight 
 And it sure does shine bright 
 You know the rhyme tight 
 And you know the others can't 
 Compete so who ever feel me 
 Come stand wit me 'cause I'm gone 
 Straight to the top and on my 
 Way to the top I know the 
 Hatin' wont stop but I don't care 
 'Cause I know my hearts blessed 
 And I got a hard head and if I don't make it this time ill just start fresh
