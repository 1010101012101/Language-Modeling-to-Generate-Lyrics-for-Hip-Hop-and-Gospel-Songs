This for the grown and sexy (Mario- grown and sexy) x4 
 - 
 If you down with me than I'm down with you 
 Ill lay a nigga down if he fuck around with you 
 And if you ride with me then ima ride with you 
 If you stick by my side ima provide for you 
 And if you there for me I'll be there for you 
 Through the laughter and tears ill care for you 
 And if you roll with me then ima roll with you 
 Bee your friend till the end and grow old with you boo 
 Peep it tho I'm a pimp and I keep a ho 
 I met this little freak like a week ago 
 Yo I'm on the aveniue and she was walking by 
 While I'm coming out the store with a bag or two 
 I woulda passed on her 
 But momie had an ass on her 
 That will have you spendin cash on her 
 I moved fast on her I'm like cmere boo 
 'Cause she was nice from her shoes to her hair doo 
 Her braclet was bright she had jewl in her ears too 
 The type that you might make your wife in a year or two 
 Yeah boo you oficially nice thas why I'm trying to get witchu tonight

 Now when I got to the spot I was rinigin her phone 
 Like I'm thinking bout bringin' you home 
 But that's ain't what it's all about 
 Unless thas what you make it about

 Listen, get your hairs done, get your nails fixed 
 Do all a that and call me back on the cell sis
