 The Hustler 
 Lassiny family 
 Them awards rappers usually bring home I ain't get 
 'Cause I ain't shit and I ain't sell enough ringtones 
 U can't be the king on the throne unless you mess with males 
 I'm not a homo so I don't expect to sell 
 But I expect to get respect fuck record sells 
 If a nigga direspect me he can catch a shell 
 But for first degree you get the death penalty 
 Or life without the posibility 
 Dat mean death in jail, unless you tell 
 And rat on somebody else 
 And put ya body on somebody else yeah dat'll probably help 
 But if you snitch just body yourself 
 Put the chrome to your own dome and homi yourself 
 Man my style so smooth dat my trial made the news 
 I came home and spent a couple hundred thou on some jewels 
 I'm a pimp, but I don't rock crocidile shoes 
 I pop the two and make a nigga crocidile food 
 Yeah [x2]

 I'm steady grindin, steady rhymin, steady puffin 
 Steady drinkin', steady thinkin', Steady hustlin 
 Chicks niggas trynna get I'm already fuckin' 
 I'm steady pipin and you steady wifin, steady cuffin 
 Dog you just barkin talkin' very tough and 
 Catch a case and start talkin' like Teddy Ruxpin 
 Homey said he had a body but he probably bluffin 
 He don't clap lead dat cat just a crackhead 
 An that shit right thurr leave cats dead 
 I don't fuck with dat I'm jus a haze and cognac head 
 I used to stack bread before the heads was that big 
 That's why you hear my music bumpin like blackheads 
 I don't think rap dead but cats just doin' it wrong 
 I don't know wat be goin' on when he doin' the song 
 I don't why he even put that verse on the song 
 He probably high and that shit he be doin' is strong 
 He been moved out the hood he been gone too long 
 He don't know wats goin' on that nigga cotton soft 
 But I'm from phila we really lettin them choppers off
