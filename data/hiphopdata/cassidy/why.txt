 Nigga talk crazy to me I'm a show'em the ooh whop 
 Throw a couple hollows knocke'm out his tube socks 
 The last nigga ran his lips got his tooth chipped 
 I'm in these streets I ain't just in this booth bitch 
 I don't just concrete'em I palm beach'em 
 Let the sharks do the work till god reach'em 
 I'm from a different pedigree of niggas 
 Before I leave the game I'm a bury me a nigga 
 I ain't never leave these streets Martin luther King talk about peace 
 Me I just walk with my peace 
 And any nigga got no manners I'll handle 
 38 long titanium handle 
 Blow a nigga head now they call him sleepy hollow 
 The headless horseman nigga close his coffin 
 This Drag dash Mr. Hood Environment 
 With Larsiny in my blood I'm out retirement 
 Why nigga you would die if you try me 
 Why nigga you would die if you try me 
 Why nigga you would die if you try me 
 Talk greasy to me I'll do you greasy for free 
 (AR AB:) 
 If it's beef I'm a end that right now 
 I light pounds and I give niggas night gowns 
 Big guns I ain't worried bout who to hit 
 I gotta hold it my shoulder when I shoot the bitch 
 I gotta few to spit let the shell smoke 
 It'll turn a nigga yacht to a sail boat 
 To fall back I'll rip'em apart 
 These niggas KFC AB like I sit in the dark 
 I go hard my gun so large 
 If it hit his chest it'll knock'em through a bar 
 Niggas soft my heart bleed Larsiny 
 We take bodies to the bridge then we tossin'em 
 The clip thirty two I drop ten on'em 
 Or beat his head with the gun till it bend on'em 
 So nigga stand in my way you'll just Luchini 
 I make his ass do a Hoodini I'll 
 Real niggas don't snitch or drop names off 
 A nigga talk he gettin' hawked witta chain saw 
 Niggas is day s off need no witness 
 I copped a scope for the low distance 
 It's black gloves when I clutch the pipe 
 I'll wet ya crib up like a busted pipe 
 I only need one shot when kill targets 
 The gun spit in ya face like a drill sergeant 
 Why nigga you would die if you try me 
 Why nigga you would die if you try me 
 Why nigga you would die if you try me 
 Talk greasy to me I'll do you greasy for free 
 (Ock Bar:) 
 I got a glock right now 
 I'm Ock bar and I bang ya clique down 
 I'm not in to flashin heat homes 
 But I'm known to pack a knife and chrome 
 Because I get crusin played out favorites 
 Stay away from me and meet the front page bitch 
 I hear that niggas bout to bring it to my places of war 
 So I'm sittin' in my chair with my face in the door 
 Give my Haitians a call tell'em to grab they machete's 
 Grip the tech with the ki if they haven't already 
 That means decapitate'em flame they home down 
 Bang the phone down it can't be long now 
 Before them fuckers come watch in the front 
 When discussion I'm just clutching the pump 
 Bustin' the chumps uh 
 I'm a gritty dude get me in a shitty mood 
 Have ya kids city zooed lion cage kitty food 
 Why nigga you would die if you try me 
 Why nigga you would die if you try me 
 Why nigga you would die if you try me 
 Talk greasy to me I'll do you greasy for free 
 (Cassidy:) 
 Err body got a chin to break but I'll put the clip in the H 
 Put it in ya face and make ya shit disintegrate 
 I'll shoot you up who the fuck you tryna intimidate 
 If you imitate get cut with the knife like a dinner plate 
 I been gettin' cake you been a bitch and I been a ape 
 The only time you niggas ride out is on the interstate 
 Yeah you been a fake nigga and I been a H N I C 
 I'm great like Ali but try me and you will get a IV 
 Or ya picture on the obituary R.I.P. 
 Barry Adrien Reese is on my ID 
 So that explains why the story written by me 
 It's called bars nigga I was locked behind bars nigga 
 In a accident which left me permanently scared nigga 
 But in ain't changed manye I'm permanently hard nigga 
 Pullin triggas on guns that's longer than a yard nigga 
 And you be six feet deep that's two yards in the dirt 
 A nigga put in work like a bartender 
 'Cause I be given niggas shot after shot 
 And I was locked behind bars and I used to grind raw 
 And I used to grind hard sellin' 
 Rock after rock 
 Till niggas started conversatin with cop after cop 
 And naw I ain't havin' that if a nigga piss me I grab the gat 
 And clap'em where his bladder at 
 And piss'em off to that's what a boss do 
 If you ever try to cross me I double cross you 
 I floss to I'm rockin' the double cross to 
 And I carry gats the size of a lil dwarf to 
 You hide out I ride out like a horse do 
 But dog when I walk with the metal it's not a horseshoe 
 You gotta wife I gotta pipe like a horse do 
 Ya wife said ya pipe to small and she gon divorce you 
 Ya little morsel to tiny to skinny 
 She want a new jimmy I can give boo plenty 
 She told me that I'm way bigger than he is 
 And she said that he more pussy than she is 
 Why nigga you would die if you try me 
 Why nigga you would die if you try me 
 Why nigga you would die if you try me 
 Talk greasy to me I'll do you greasy for free 
 (Luck:) 
 The barrel is steel the frame worth tougher wear 
 I get my guns liquidated than a buck a pair 
 Now yaw tell me who want this here 
 You suckers scared I claw through ya chest like a fuckin' bear 
 I'm an animal surrounded by cannibals 
 My niggas feed on ya flesh like cannibal 
 These niggas talkin' all irrational 
 My gang of wolves they'll squeeze to the death when the hammer full 
 I write magical my flow game radical 
 My bars keep'em on they toes like lambisil 
 The hustla home the customers back 
 It's Luck and Cass who fuckin' with that 
 We runnin' these streets you want beef 
 Just run in a neak or Ock and Shiz keep a gun in they reach 
 So stick to ya day job cause yaw don't even want it with AR 
 And I ain't talkin' 'bout the gun I b sprayin' off 
 And you can talk about your pistols and clappin' ya heat off 
 Witta rock it'll clear more than half of your street off 
 Even if it miss the impact knock ya feet off 
 It'll throw niggas up then down like a see-saw 
 And for that cheese dog I'm knockin' ya knees off 
 Every part of your dismembered body will b lost 
 I handle my own but niggas like to shoot for meh 
 I got the guns that's for military use only 
 Straight militant I shoot it like a troop homie 
 I don't need fatigue or combat boots on meh 
 Top rank I'm the man you should see 
 I'm the Colonel The General Commander-in Chief 
 The only nigga fit to be demandin is me 
 I'm a boss I demand niggas ransoms to brae 
 The smoke fade left standin is me 
 When it's beef Luck bring the war tanks to the STREETS!
