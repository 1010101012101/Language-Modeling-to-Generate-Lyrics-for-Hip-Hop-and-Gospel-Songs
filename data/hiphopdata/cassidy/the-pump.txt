Yo my flow got niggas sick like hiv 
 See I rhyme and I box like the great ali 
 The more rhymes that I got the more cake I see 
 And every song that I'm on is a h... i... t niggas always gown hate aqui but my name hold weight aqui 
 I'm in the hood 
 And I'm good like the my hand gun game but the pump make 'em jump like an and 1 game 
 I'm a problem y'all niggas no what's up my album a classic don't get it fucked up 
 Ya ain't hype man 
 I'm nice on the mic for real 
 Me and swiss just got an undisclosed nike deal 
 Just to do the soundtrack for they website if you don't see the big picture get ya head right 
 When I rock my jewels I don't got to use headlights and I take an ugly chick if her head nice 
 The pump make a nigga jump jump
