They say that word is everything, everything in whose eyes? 
 Guys confuse lies with the truth the truth of true lies 
 My two eyes seen plenty of dudes die but I suvive (survive) 
 You guys can't walk in my shoes I'm not your shoe size 
 I flipped a few bricks, couple birds blew by 
 Coke white like it got blonde hair and blue eyes 
 Pies I move when I'm in the hood I'm a hoodalum 
 I jewelry shop my jewelry box remind me of jerusalem 
 Cats let they gat blast fast like a moosalum (muslim) 
 I call my nine ramadan when I'm introducing him 
 I smoke pot like snoop and them 
 Pockets fat like bruce bruce and them, 
 Fat man scoop and them 
 All my shooters I keep losin them 
 They either in a box or a cell block 
 Prosecution accusin them 
 Cats is rattin, prosecution confusin them 
 Of course to get rectified they go to court and testify 
 Lift they right hand on the stand, 
 Snitch on they right hand man 
 And blame it on the white man, damn, 
 I took a hundred grand out this white man hand 
 And gave him three k's like that white man klan 
 My band rockin' out like a white man band- 
 My watch is rockin' out like a white man band 
 That's a joke I hope I don't offend my white man fans 
 The smoke is in the air like a high man's hands 
 The mic is a deadly weapon in the right man hands 
 I'm not a hater but I'm not a tight pants fan 
 Tight pants I can't stand, I dress like a damn man 
 If you dress like the opposite sex you a damn tran (transvestite) 
 Aluminum bat, CRACK, grand slam 
 I might be in the bent (bentley), might be in the damn van 
 The turtle gettin' top 'cause I'm freaky like cam's man (frekey zekey) 
 The truth be told, the whole industry is a damn scam 
 Ran by pricks with big heads like an NBA jam man 
 I'm the sandman, I'm a 'lac you a grand am 
 Fall back and get smacked with the back of my damn hand, man 
 I ain't mumble neither you don't wanna rumble neither 
 Float like a butterfly, I be the bumble beat ya 
 I'm a winter warmer and I'm a summer freezer 
 Shinin, black and white diamonds, jungle fever 
 I'm a jungle lion, you a jungle zebra 
 You just run around the jungle, I'm the jungle leader 
 You just eat grass, cass eat fuckin' zebras 
 So I don't need to hear nothin' I'm off the fuckin' meter 
 I ain't bluffin neither, I'm on fire, got a fuckin' fever 
 I'm the hustler, you a fuckin' diva 
 If lifes a bitch then fuckin' leave her 
 It's like if you don't like living then, break up with her then 
 And once you break up you can't make up with her and 
 Start actin' right, come back to life and live again 
 I live life like its sweet to the bitter end 
 Until I'm a heavenly citizen ima get it in
