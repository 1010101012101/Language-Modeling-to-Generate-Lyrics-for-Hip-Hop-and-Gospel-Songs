I still move work from the AM to the PM 
 Niggas got beef, Imma spray 'em when I see em 
 (Gat sounds) 
 Imma spray 'em when I see 'em 
 (Gat sounds) 
 Imma spray 'em when I see 'em 
 I pump on the streets from the AM to the PM 
 A nigga want beef, Imma spray 'em when I see em 
 Lay 'em when I see 'em 
 AK 'em when I see 'em 
 Hop out the Bronco and OJ 'em when I see 'em 
 Cut a bone out his skin 
 Fish fillet 'em when I see 'em 
 Than wire his grill, Kayne 'em when I see 'em 
 My young'ns on they job so I pay 'em when I see 'em 
 Turn Boyz II Men, I Juanye 'em when I see 'em 
 'Cause I be on the grind from the PM to the AM 
 Paint pictures with my rhymes 
 You can see 'em when I say 'em 
 My songs' like movies 
 You can see 'em when you play 'em 
 If a nigga want beef 
 When I see 'em Imma spray him 
 For six G's I can get your whip swiss cheesed 
 I'm like a red nose pit you a mixed breed 
 Bitch please, all them dudes in your crew ass 
 I get you strangled wit the strings on your du-rag 
 Imma let you niggas talk all stupid 
 Till you get hawked all stupid 
 Sparked all stupid 
 Outlined in chalk all stupid 
 Dog got bite I don't bark all stupid 
 It is what it is 
 I'm in the coupe droop dropped all stupid 
 Fitted hat cocked all stupid 
 Gettin' top all stupid 
 My clientelle cop all stupid 
 We make sales on the block all stupid 
 It is what it is 
 It's a fact that I rap all stupid 
 Get your wig pushed back all stupid 
 We strapped all stupid 
 I'll get you clapped all stupid 
 Don't let the pills and the yack make you act all stupid (Stupid) 
 Yeah I do my thing all stupid 
 Let my chain bling all stupid 
 My ring all stupid 
 And my earring all stupid 
 I got the things and I sling all stupid 
 Yo my flow have you so amazed and astonished 
 I been hot since I copped my first Sega with Sonic 
 Back in the day, when Shawn Kemp played for the Sonics 
 I rocked the used jeans and I played the atonics 
 You know I blow haze, I be blazin' the chronic 
 It got my mind scrambled, like a egg in a omellete 
 I talk with God every day and he made me a promise 
 Me and T like Malcolm and Elijah Mohammed 
 Me and Swiss like Martin and Jessie 
 But the fact that I can get assassinated is starting to stress me 
 I ain't tryin' to let the police department arrest me 
 But I still keep a steel tucked under the fresh tee 
 And I ain't just rappin' for my health 
 So before you diss me, you be better off clappin' at yourself 
 'Cause I ain't trying to battle on the mic 
 I'll have them goons hop out on you like they did Harold at the light
