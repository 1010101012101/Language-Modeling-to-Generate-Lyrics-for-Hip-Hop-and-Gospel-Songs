Yeah, feel me, 
 Who else wanna hold this down? 
 Yeah, The hustler, 
 I'm the problem lemme introduce myself 
 My life rough but, I would never shoot myself 
 Anything I once done I execute myself 
 I'm a one man army I solute myself 
 I'm the hustler lemme introduce myself 
 I just stood on the block and got loot myself 
 ?? 
 I'm the truth in the booth I solute myself 
 You ain't got no wins in me casa 
 That piffy get me open I be smokin' like a rasta, Vodka, 
 Henny get the semi or the choppa, blocka, 
 You be screamin "Get me to the doctor!" 
 The hustler, Yeah, 
 Philly, Yeah, 
 Show time lets go grind it's a gold mine we be rich in no time, 
 I'm gettin' guap strip poppin' 
 If they hear some they be speakin' in tongues 
 What you say? I can't hear you? 
 My glock poppin' what's poppin'? 
 I ain't fuckin' dumb, you don't never bust guns, 
 What you say? Get the fuck outta here 
 Yo, You already know my flow been discussed and I been hustlin I don't really need an introduction 
 But I'ma introduce myself anyway, 
 I'm the hustler And you could try your hand anyday, 
 Anywhere, any place, at any time 
 I did plenty crimes, I got pulled like many blimes, 
 Look, Y'all took my shit way to many times, 
 Any rhyme you spit gonna sound like one of mine, 
 But the many kind, You a mini me, I'm a amazon, If you wanna battle stand in line, 
 I'm a man with mine If you think you better then me then prove it, I'm undefeated, 
 You lost before and you gonna lose again, 
 You will get chewed again, 
 That's what kinda mood I'm in, 
 I'm gonna make spittin' hot punch lines cool again, 
 You dudes hot right where the hot music then? 
 People ain't gonna let you keep foolin them, 
 Ain't nothin' change I'm still aimin, bangin' still, 
 You don't gang bang for real, you still need trainin wheels, 
 Cause you not a rider, 
 I'll show you how the flamer feels 
 Hotter whole clip and a bullet in the chamber feels, 
 You don't know how carrying a banger feel, 
 You don't get no respect like Rodney Dangerfield You prolly never slammed crack cocaine for real, 
 Or took them white things on an airplane for real, I had my young boy slang your grills, 
 And this little bitch runnin' with the rocker one named a mil, 
 You could ask about me my name is real, 
 I'm a one man army and I was trained to kill, 
 For real.
