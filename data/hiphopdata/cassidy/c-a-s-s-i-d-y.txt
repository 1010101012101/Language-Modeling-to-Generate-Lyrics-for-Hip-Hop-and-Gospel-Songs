 Listen up man I be switchin up the language. 
 I used to slang with the cain in my anus. 
 But now I'm famous, you know how the game is. 
 I came to let you niggas know what my name is. (Cassidy) 
 I'm C-A double S to the I-D-Y nigga you will die if you try me. 
 I see you niggas sweet like HI-C, but let me let you know the name on my ID. 
 Barry Adrian Reese, that's my real name (Cassidy). 
 I got a vicious spill game and I peel cain. 
 I still came from the grind and the gristle. 
 Just tryna make a dollar out of dime and a nickel. 
 I'm palmin the pistol, we can make war. 
 You thought that when they made ya guns that they ain't make more? And I'm gonna make sure I do it big for my peoples kid. 
 I ain't tryna let my city down like the Eagles did.

 It's true, money do talk 'cause we conversated. 
 That's why everything I do I get compensated. 
 It's easy to get cheese, it ain't complicated. 
 A nigga got what you need you go and confiscate it. 
 I'm kinda hated but the love kinda dominate it. 
 I ain't lyricist of the year, but I was nominated. 
 My whole family on the grind so I'm crime related. 
 All this time I waited to shine, it's bout time I made it. 
 The drama, save it, I ain't lookin' for beef. 
 I'm sittin' in the kitchen cookin the geese with no feathers and beaks. 
 We way better you could never compete. 
 You hear how Swiss put together the beat? 
 He make it easy for me. 
 I paint pictures make it easy to see. 
 It ain't nuttin to talk greezy to me, I 
 Do you greezy fa free. 
 You should know I'm not a game by now, and you should definitely now my fuckin' name by now.

 I'm a gangsta you can tell by my verses I am. 
 Let me explain what kind of person I am. 
 When I was young they called me a BeBe kid, 
 I was worser than them. 
 I was wild as a child and got worser at 10. When 
 I start dislikin the rules like it was cool. 
 Actin' a fool, fightin, bringin' knives to my school. 
 I cooled down at 13 and start mackin the whores, 
 That's when I fell back and started actin' mature. 
 I hit the scene at 15 and started gettin' a name 'cause I was rhymin and grindin, I was gettin' the change. 
 A couple years later got down with the team. 
 I was signed to Ruff Ryders movin pounds of the green. 
 I did a groove album, but I ain't get a release, 
 That's when I politiced with Swiss and started rippin his beats. 
 But I was still hittin the streets and sellin the cain. 
 I'm a hustla, muthafucka tell 'em the name.
