Man cass back 
 And you ain't gotta ask where my cash at 
 'Cause I been holdin' weight 
 For so long I gotta bad back 
 I done alot 
 Run to the block give me flachbacks 
 Money ain't a thing if you broke you get laughed at 
 I'm boutta bring the thing thing and the mask back 
 Run up on you take ya bling bling... let me have that 
 I ain't comfortable holdin' bundles in my asscrack 
 I'm past that... 20 stacks on my last rack 
 That's anotha reason why I gotta bad back 
 I even hit a chick that's ugly if her ass fat 
 I smash cats... I be eatin niggas up 
 But fuck a battle ima start beatin' niggas up 
 I'm the punchline champion 
 You got rhymes but I heard 'em all before 
 Like sunshine anderson 
 You niggas bitches 
 If I put you on my hitlist 
 You'll walk around rockin' football equipment 
 And if I don't blow... fuck it 
 I got ounces of drow that go for 4hundred! 
 When the coup come in 
 I'm on the block all night 
 Wit rocks of the white the size of monopoly dice 
 If ya watch nice... the cannon to your ribs 
 I make you strip naked like deangilo did 
 'Cause I hadle more bread then you, get more head then you 
 'Cause I do shit you scared to do...
