I'm fresh to death I'm so so fly (hustling) 
 Getting money everyday no lie 
 I get cream I'm clean everything brand name 
 And I spent 50 grand just for 1 dam chain 
 I'm in my Gucci, Louis, Fendi 
 Gucci, Louis, Fendi 
 Gucci, Louis, Fendi that's why stupid niggas envy 
 Gucci, Louis, Fendi 
 Gucci, Louis, Fendi 
 Gucci, Louis, Fendi that's why all these groupies with me. 
 Let the truth be told 
 I be gettin' stupid hoes 
 But you go both ways and take it in the dookie hole 
 I'm with this groupie 
 My finger in her coochie hole 
 I made her leave with a sore throat and her coochie swole whoa 
 She gave me head like where poofy go 
 She dig me cause of my Fendi, Louis, and Gucci clothes 
 I got stupid flows 
 My punch lines impeccable 
 I'll turn you to a vegetable 
 It ain't beef to be technical 
 You a retard your bars are unacceptable 
 Your far from a professional 
 The streets don't F with you 
 I'm a veteran too 
 On point like a decimal 
 And you on my testicles 
 I lost all respect for you 
 Who the heck is you? 
 I ain't trying to connect with you 
 Ichat, twitter, direct message you. 
 Shit you punks can get jumped like checkers do 
 I can dress but I stay fresh when I'm naked too 
 I'm fresh to death I'm so so fly (hustling) 
 Getting money everyday no lie 
 I get cream I'm clean everything brand name 
 And I spent 50 grand just for 1 dam chain 
 I'm in my Gucci, Louis, Fendi 
 Gucci, Louis, Fendi 
 Gucci, Louis, Fendi that's why stupid niggas envy 
 Gucci, Louis, Fendi 
 Gucci, Louis, Fendi 
 Gucci, Louis, Fendi that's why all these groupies with me.
