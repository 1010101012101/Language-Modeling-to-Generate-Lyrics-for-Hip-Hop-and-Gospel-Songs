I don't think nobody betta then me in this whole world 
 I'm so thoroughl I'm the hottest in this cold world 
 O shit I;m so sick I gotta go early 
 And I be on some hoe shit ask ma old girl 
 If dis waz ya world it wouldn't be no girls 
 'Cause you only like men alrite den go girl 
 U trifflin pussy like and hermaphrodite 
 I straight like 6'oclock ya not so pass da mic 
 Itz a reccession I copped ma watch 4 half da price 
 But da ice still see-through like a glass of sprite ima hustla I had da white 
 But I had 2 quit 'cause 4 bricks dey a lock you up 4 half ya life 
 I'm da truth you ain't half as nice 
 I mean da source magazine gon proly give you half a mic when I die dey gon proly bring me back 2 life 
 But if dey not successful ima catch you in da after life right we all gotta die some day
