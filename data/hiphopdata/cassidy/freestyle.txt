Yeah, this Swizz Beats 
 We need y'all to vote. 
 Vote or die, man 
 {Cassidy} 
 Y'all already know what it is 
 Let's get em. 
 Tha block pop so tha strip full 
 Rocks-got a fist full 
 Bull pop shit that hot shit I got a clip for 
 When I start sparkin' it be barkin like pitbulls 
 Matter fact rottweilers when I let them shots holla 
 Chicks on my cock 
 I'm still on tha block holla 
 Its cops on tha block, they still gon cop holla 
 Ock I got cents and that's why I got dollars 
 I was told tha rules 
 I'm old school like my pop father 
 I was showed tha moves 
 Schooled by the older dudes 
 How to show and prove 
 So I move like a soldier move 
 Real militant 
 I'm ill, still killin' it 
 I'm real guys that's paralyzed that's still feelin' it 
 Yeah I'm still on my feet and my toes 
 Gettin' higher than tha presidential suite at tha nose 
 Gettin' higher than tha nose bleed seats to my shows 
 Fuck a Maybach I play tha back seats of the Rolls 
 Fuck a GT I pull up in CLS 
 Tha butt soft like my females breast 
 Is it a V12? 
 Yes 
 I cop the uncoppable nigga 
 You can't stop the unstoppable nigga 
 I pop a shot threw you niggas 
 And I was like a Pop to you niggas I gave you a flow 
 Adopted you niggas 
 I did alot for you niggas 
 And this tha fuckin' thanks I get? 
 You my son you should thank my dick! 
 You take my shit, flip it around and now you think you sick? 
 I guess you think you Cass but I think you trash 
 And I'a spank dat ass you ain't fuckin' wit me 
 You wouldn't even rap like dat if it wasn't for me 
 Wow 
 I been had my weight up 
 How you gon battle me wit a style dat I made up? 
 Wow 
 When I'm home it's envy 
 I'm feelin' like tha boy Pac when he was on tha phone wit Biggie 
 Wow 
 What tha fuck is goin' on out here? 
 What tha fuck is niggas doin' out here? 
 Niggas drawn out here 
 Ya block hot, I put a jawn out there 
 My block hot ya shit warm out there 
 So we goin' out there 
 Set up shop and get it on out there 
 Pop shots and get it on out there 
 I'm on point like a thorn out here 
 Come to philly I'm a don out here 
 Yeah you know I'm a boss dog 
 Nah diss ain't izod, it's lacrosse dog 
 I floss dog and I stay wit my juelz on 
 You probably wouldn't see this much ice in a hail storm 
 Its nuttin to flash but fuckin' wit Cass a get you bucked or bucked and a half 
 'Cause its only a handful of rappers that's touchin the cash 
 And most of them getting fucked in they ass 
 The snakes up in the grass 
 But Cass gone blast when the beef is on 
 I walk wit the shells and I ain't got no adidas on 
 And I squeeze tha join' even when tha law watchin 
 I'm too hard, tha rap version of bernard hopkins, nigga... 
 Cassidy, bitch! 
 Scream at me.
