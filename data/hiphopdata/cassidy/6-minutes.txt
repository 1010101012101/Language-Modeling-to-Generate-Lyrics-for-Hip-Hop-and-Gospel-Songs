(Cassidy) 
 Jyeah, I go by the name of Cassidy the hustla and 
 I brought 2 of my niggas with me 
 And we about to shut the industry down 
 Hey yo weezy let's get it poppin' 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 Hit me, Fuck that shit it's the southside 
 Got a fat dick in your mouth wide 
 I from to take it outside naw do it right here 
 How bout later on get on everybody home 
 You fuckin' with weezy f baby please say the baby 
 Ridin' with your bitch got keys on the lady 
 Triple gold Deez 
 Vogue tires on the whip 
 Young Carters sliding out 
 I'm flyer then the whip yeee 
 Higher then an angel or hotter then the devil 
 The pot or kettle uh 
 The metal let 'em burn like ursher but worser 
 If its any beef I come Ron like mercer 
 Word up eagle street up 
 Throwin' my curve up 
 We take your ice cream and turn you into shurbut 
 I got flow I'm like sure but 
 If its bout doh I'm like sure nuff 
 I'm from the bird bunch 
 Birdman J.R. you niggas burn luch 
 I see your lips moving but I ain't heard much 
 You see the wrist movin it looks like pure punch 
 I hear them player hatin' but I don't endure such 
 I got the escalade guts like a tour bus 
 I got the styrafome poured up with syrup 
 And in the tires is where the packages gone 
 My, it's been a good year with these firestones 
 I spit like Maya's poems poem and chromas 
 For the buya's chromosomes I got somas 
 I got vikadine's, valiums I ain't stoppin' 
 Got powder heroin X oxycotton 
 And that's how we rockin' 
 Hot when you hear that bop unless I'm beboppin 
 Jyeah skip when you hear dat clip 
 Cash money nigga I'm that shit weezy baby 
 (Cassidy) 
 That's what I'm talkin' bout 
 Now fab spit at these niggas and let 'em know why that ain't fuckin' with you 
 (Fabolous) 
 God damn right I'm feelin' my self 
 A chauffeur no sir I'm willing my self 
 Lookin' for a chick chillin' for self 
 So I could show her the suicides and talk her into killin' herself 
 I'm havin' problems dealin' with wealth 
 But you wouldn't understand until you get a million yourself 
 You niggas must of got a deal for your health 
 Your CD is frozen food it just chill on the shelf 
 I spend big 
 At any time I could start splurgin 
 The twin sigs open chest like a heart surgen 
 And I'm button up I'm chest a blue collar crook 
 But I keep a stack thich as few college books 
 I got a new polished look and 20 dime bitches 
 To show y'all niggas how my 2 dollars look 
 The boy got at least 6 digits on 
 So the guns gotta be at least migit long 
 The money is like 10 bridges long 
 I throw bread around just to turn pigeons on 
 I got some good smoke just for puffers 
 The 2 gram 20's make the husltas suffer 
 Plus its fluffa then a cotton ball 
 I've gotten calls wantin me to put the pot in malls 
 But nowadys you can't put it pass them 
 I got a dan marino arm 
 I'm bout to throw sum bullets pass em 
 And the niggas in the hood keep quotin ma lines 
 I don't jump ships I keep floatin in mine 
 Long as I keep totin I'm fine 
 Ima hav these dick suckin niggas deepthroatin the nine 
 I jumped in the England ship 
 Benz 'n' whip 
 Its terminator two chrome the engines diff 
 I'm readin scripts tho not the penmanship 
 The box office shit 
 A box office bitch 
 Jessica alba kirsten dunce 
 N still make a mill on a first in months 
 These dudes be the first to front 
 Till they family 'n' frens is in limos 
 They in hurs in front 
 I'm in the top position 
 I could make u a proposition 
 I'm in a hard top waitin on a drop edition 
 The hell with the patients 
 Ima send a nigga down under like Australian vacations 
 (Cassidy) 
 Ye it is wat it is, ma niggas jus kilt y'all and ima close the casket 
 I'm tryin' not to let this industry get the best of me y'all 
 I work hard for the fame the game stressin me y'all 
 All they do is complain what the expect from me y'all 
 From the hood to Hollywood they respectin me y'all 
 N even over seas they acceptin me y'all 
 All the ladies show me love the thugs reppin me y'all 
 I got alot of dirty money so expect me to ball 
 But I'm savin' all my checks I'm investin them all 
 They say what goes up is goin' definitily fall 
 Even the stars plus success is ma destiny y'all 
 Look I cook tracks I got the recipe y'all 
 You can't name another cat that could mess with me y'all 
 At the shows all the hoes be molestin me y'all 
 I got broads cryin tryin' to get next to me y'all 
 I got broads cravin begging to hav sex wit me y'all 
 Screamin cass you don't know how sexy you are 
 And I'm happy I'm alive god blessin me y'all 
 And all the problems that arive its god testin me y'all 
 So I pray everyday but I ain't prayin' too much 
 'Cause I be sinnin everyday so I ain't prayin' enough 
 And we callin compete and I ain't sayin' I'm tough 
 But if its beef I don't speak I ain't sayin' wassup 
 If its beef when we meet then I'm sprayin shit up 
 Prraat prraat I ain't sayin' too much and that's that 
 'Cause that cat you embrassin wit luv 
 Might clap that gat 'cause he got hate in his blood 
 Keep ur friens at a distance and your enemies close 
 'Cause the folks you call frens tend to envy the most 
 Some cats will hang themself if you giv 'em a rope 
 Burn a bridge and don't give them a boat let 'em sink 
 Sometimes you gotta give them some time to let them think 
 But sometime you gotta give them the nine and let 'em stink 
 You can't bring any horse to the pond 'n' let 'em drink 
 I'd rather keep my eyes wide open instead of blink 
 'Cause soon as ur eyes shut them niggas will ride up 
 And the guys that you trust will be gettin' you tied up 
 And y'all gotta die but I ain't ready to leave 
 That's why even if its petty I'll be ready to squeeze 
 Well for ya cheddar your cheese your guack or mula I'll pop the Ruger 
 Send dat hot shit threw ya 
 Like BOO-YA dats the sound when the pound bustin' 
 Ooh ah you'll be layin on the ground sufferin 
 Clown is nothin' to pull out 'n' blast you 
 I try to only resourt to violence if I have to 
 But man niggas out here ain't playin' fair 
 So before the odds even I'm leavin' I'm layin there 
 And I ain't even plaiyn believe what I'm sayin' here 
 So before this shit get furtha ur click get murdered 
 And thrown in a whole in the grass 
 For tryin' to play that thug role ill stomp a mud roll in ya ass 
 And this cass nigga I'm that sick 
 Full surface nigga I'm that shit, 
 Bitch
