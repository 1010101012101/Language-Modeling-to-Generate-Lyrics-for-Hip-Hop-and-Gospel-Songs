My hand on my damn cock 
 And I coped a gun so big it could probably kill handcock 
 I not a rat, me talkin' to the damn cops 
 Is like Louis Farrakhan eatin hamhocks 
 Imma gorilla but I'm slicker than a damn fox 
 Been cool since pre-school playin' in the sand box 
 Imma hustla I used to hand tha gram ma' 
 I can stand on the corner sellin gram after gram ma' 
 And no I'm not from Japan ma' 
 It just look like its asian in me/ 'cause I keep the haze up in me 
 I been in jail, I got a couple 100 dayz ^ n me 
 But I still keep the ak and the razor wit me 
 I ball hard so other ballers is afraid to stick me 
 'Cause if I get fouled ill probably shoot the teck 
 And you can be the next nigga ill shoot to def 
 I wild-out, But if I foul out ill shoot the ref 
 I'm happy when I'm in the coupe' but the roof depressed 
 'Cause I always put them down the trunk is where I put them now 
 I got doe, ever since 0 put a pound in my hand 
 I been the man, you should put the crown on my dome 
 I'm on the phone havin' conference callz/ wit millionare "yeah" looked what I accomplished y'all 
 And I ain't tryna take a life I got a conscience y'all 
 Plus the laws send you ^ north like the compass y'all 
 I was 17 living out in Yonkers y'all 
 Signed to RuffRiders wit a flow that was bonkers y'all 
 I can even lie, you can BMY, you can ask swizz too, SP and kiss too 
 You can ask DMX, the female Pitt 2/ and they'll let you know all the battles I had to get threw 
 You can ask drag or sheek about how I had to eat 
 Thousands of muffuckaz, YUP, man I had the streets 
 But ain't no money in battlin' 
 And I had to eat 
 I can spit reckless but I had to make a hit record 
 And now I make hit record after hit record/ And I make chicks get naked like this check it 
 I juss lick my lips on some LL shit 
 And make em' laugh on some david chappelle shit 
 And they be on some lets go to the hotel shit 
 And I give em' hard dick on some just got out of jail shit 
 The innocent man, been in the Can 
 But I neva made a statement never been on the stand 
 And Im independent now but that been in the plans 
 And it's all about the benjamins man... real talk 
 And you dude can't walk in my timbalands man 
 And m y sneaks don't fit you/ the streets don't fuck wit you 
 And I sip champagne 
 And I throw back shots 
 And smoke pot the color of a Apple Jacks box 
 I rap but I sold crack rocks 
 And had the block jumpin' like the frogs on the honey smacks box 
 You digg em"...body bags!
