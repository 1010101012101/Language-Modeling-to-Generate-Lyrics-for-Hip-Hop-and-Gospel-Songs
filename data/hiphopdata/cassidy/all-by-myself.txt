I don't have no one, but me myself and I, listen, I gotta get some work done man, I ain't come in the studio just to chill, na na, this nigga swizz just flew out, this nigga ne yo sleep, so I'm a go over to this mp and see if I can come up with my own track to keep it movin' yeah let me try that, aight, find these drums, yeah this knockin', yeah that's crazy right there, yeah, I'm feelin' that, ok, let me add these high hats, ok, I think I'm gettin' the hang out of this joint man, aight, I'm a make this beat myself man, now let me add this scratch, ok and the crash, breakdown, add this 808 drum and get it knockin' a lil bit more, that's crazy, I'm feeling this track right here man, all I gotta do is spit somethin' crazy, it's a wrap... 
 I'm in the zone all by myself, 
 I'm alone all by myself I'm on my own, 
 But homes I could set the tone myself, 
 And make the track that I could rap on myself 
 I wrote the rap myself, did the track myself, went in the booth produced that myself, I did the bass did the claps myself, did the drums snares and the high hats myself, uh I play each sound I'm banging out beats now, the only one with heat now holdin' the streets down, I paint pictures everybody could see but besides god I ain't got nobody but me... 
 I'm in the zone all by myself 
 I'm alone all by myself, 
 But I don't need nobody else, but me... and god... 
 I wanna thank my fans, good lookin' for the mail, 
 'Cause I was goin' through it when they put me in the jail, they put me in the cell, just me and the rats, and my relationship with god is what kept me relaxed, DA will say anything except for the facts, and they had alot of evidence except for the gats, 
 Before they prove you guilty they will treat you like a criminal, they tried to give me first degree they said it was intentional, I had to get shit together on my own, the media was talkin' like I'm never comin' home, me and my mother used to talk together on the phone, she said keep your faith and you will beat this case, yup 
 I gotta clique that'll grip steel for me, 
 I gotta squad that'll ride that'll kill for me, 
 But I argue and fight with my own mother, and now a days you can't even trust your own brother, 
 So make sure you keep your enemies the closest to you, cause your friends will the ones who put the toasters to you, that's why you gotta watch your surroundins, cause niggas that can swim love watchin you drownin, so only real niggas chill with me, but ain't nobody gonna pay my bills but me, see, you might got a crew that can help, but if you want it done right you gotta do it yourself
