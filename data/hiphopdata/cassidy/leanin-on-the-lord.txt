 Heres a story bouta shorty chasin the cream 
 Her daddy was a inmate, her mommmy was a fiend 
 Her grandmom old so she couldn't get control of her 
 It was all love till the drugs took hold of her 
 First it was liquor then it was weed 
 Then next came the wet then the serve and vease ease 
 Oxycotton she poppin' them pills and if you gotta couple dollas she'll hop in them wheels (fareal) 
 Until one day a nigga wit paper took her out got her built up and raped her 
 Fam even had a camcorder and taped her 
 And soon as her high faded shorty felt violated 
 So she stopped gettin' high all the damn time 
 Only person she could talk to was her grandmom 
 Now every Sunday she be goin' to church wit her 
 She leaned on the lord now he startin to work wit her. (yamean)

 Heres a story bouta yung rapper named cassidy 
 He started off at 13 I mean he actually 
 Signed his first deal when he was still goin' to high skoo 
 10th grade way back then he was a fly dood 
 He played by the rules determined to get cake 
 He started off battlin and rippin the mixtapes 
 But he didn't take the same path that the rest do 
 He dropped a debute that was highly successful 
 That's when the respect came 
 That's when the checks came 
 He realized life is like playin' a chess game 
 Him and swiss they started makin' the next album 
 They say when you make more money expect problems 
 But the problem that he faced was unheard of 
 They locked 'em up no bail and charged him with murder 
 But now he got his freedom restored 
 And he livin' his dream that's why he leanin on the side of the lord. (yamean)
