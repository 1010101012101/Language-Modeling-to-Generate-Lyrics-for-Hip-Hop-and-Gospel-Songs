I'm nice with the lead peel your edges like slices of bread 
 Precise, become a poltergeist, stickin' knives inside of your head 
 What's the issue, on a roll, like a roll of toilet tissue? 
 I continue to expose you niggas that's so superficial 
 I script you your obituary then blow like a missile 
 Once I blow the whistle, motherfuck may the forces be with you 
 Come with a style, I'm wildin', pile up my money so kosher, 
 Then call up the sofa fuckin' bitches in back of the rover 
 Then bounce with the coca, bag up bitches outside of the costa rica area level, 
 My features and carry my posters 
 Unprecedented, I cemented, you changin' your flow up 
 While helpin' you grow up, niggas know you for soundin' so tore up 
 Challengin' niggas, better hold on to banister niggas 
 Fuck around I'll stuff your body parts into canisters niggas 
 Like you don't know the half, I'll bust' your motherfuckin' ass 
 Busta buss, cass, and papoose is fuckin' psychopaths 
 Making niggas wanna get hype yeah I'm psycho 
 My nigga beside me with triggers and niggas get bodied 
 I lock a strip and chop a brick like I'm Mr. Miyagi 
 But this ain't karate, I been sick since I pissed in a potty 
 I probably been proper since my papa put dick in my mommy 
 I'm a cannon man 
 Holdin' the hamma man 
 For the loot niggas shoot niggas like a camera man 
 Snappin' a picture, you get stuck like the back of a sticker 
 I got bars like the factory manufacturing snickers 
 And I do crimes for the bread like croutons 
 With two nines I be layin' clowns down like foutons 
 With the bullets in the rocket, my pockets is full of cream 
 I'm blowin' steam keep the steel in my hands like wolverine 
 Poppin' the metal, you niggas is not on my level 
 I'm locking the kettle man, I'm hot like the pot and the kettle 
 On the mic I spaz, who get it hype as cass 
 And my nigga busta, we some motherfuckin' psychopaths 
 I'm an iceberg trapped in a fire I won't melt 
 I'm a fetus that survived an abortion, I won't be kilt (killed) 
 I'm the heart of Brooklyn, New York, I'm bedstuy 
 I'm a christian woman's hand on the bible I won't lie 
 I'm the code of silence in the gotti crew 
 I'm an empty mag right after a shootout, I just bodied you 
 Got something sup? shotgun pump, shot at you 
 Like kamakize through, your baby mom's feel the wop cock back 
 'Cause she was sittin' on my lap 
 I stay with the oowap strap 
 I put your baby daddy in a body bag 
 When I squeeze and let the wop clap 
 I Baghdad like Iraq 
 This is my era, you niggas is losers 
 I'm the new era (error) like a mistake on your computer 
 Got the infrared dot, bustin' you gullible suckers too 
 But a dot on your ass like www
