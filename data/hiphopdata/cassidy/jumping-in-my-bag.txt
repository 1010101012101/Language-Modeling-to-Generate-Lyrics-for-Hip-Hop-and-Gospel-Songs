You can't judge a book by its cover 
 You gotta read it man 
 But as far as narcotics 
 I got it if you need it man 
 I got that piff if you need a gram 
 Its light green 
 But it got orange hairs like peter pan 
 I'm hot headed but no 
 Iaint got a fever man I'm ambedextrious 
 I can squueze it with either hand 
 And... 
 My flow tight 
 Like me and my main squeeze 
 You try to chase cake 
 But y'all don't run the same speed 
 I pay cheese for my watch and my chain please 
 If you kiss my ring 
 You will prolly get a brain freeze 
 (Ha ha) 
 Sometime I smoke until I can't breath 
 But y'all stem seeds 
 We don't smoke the same weed 
 I'm what the game need 
 I rap realistically 
 Is some one out there sick as me 
 It's a mystery 
 I celebrate christmas because of the epiphany 
 But santa clause and rudolph don't exist to me 
 I see some things 
 That you will never get to see 
 That's why icant let these hating ass niggas 
 Get to me 
 Ismoke the trees 
 And stay smoking to stay focus 
 Istay with toasters 
 You only kill when you spray roaches 
 Where yo burner hater 
 You an exterminator 
 So of course should call you the orkin man 
 Acting like a killer made you a fortune man 
 But the only beef you had 
 You can stick a fork in man 
 Yo muther should of had an obortion 
 Man cause you just taking up space 
 Youy a f****** fake 
 You the type to go to jail 
 And get f*** raped 
 I'm a f***** ape 
 You a rat 
 Stay in yo f***** place 
 Before iempty out the f*** h 
 They gone need dental records 
 When the heckler hit cha f*** face 
 And iaint tryna catch a nuva case 
 But ill squezze if its drama dawg 
 Word to my mama dawg 
 Yo the pump a make you jump 
 Like some kinda frog 
 Cause you a b**** you know the lil 
 Poodle kinda dog
