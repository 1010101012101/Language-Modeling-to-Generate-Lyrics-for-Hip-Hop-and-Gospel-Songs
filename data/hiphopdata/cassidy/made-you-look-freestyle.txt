Locked for 2 long, been hot for to long, 
 Watch you won't be on the top for to long, 
 Oc, stop tryin' be pac when you do songs, 
 I shot gunz you gotta pop wit 2 arms, 
 Ma cock 2 long, ma shot to visious, 
 I'm in a h2 gettin' top from to bitches, 
 Let do business, I gettin' pies in, 
 And I been had it crackin' like dry skin, 
 We pretend, I live what I sing about, 
 I bought I crib and I ain't even got a single out, 
 And they already got a best of cassidy, 
 And none of y'all niggaz can mess wit cassidy, 
 U wont shine if you mess wit cassidy, 
 U jus ain't got enough mind compasidity, 
 I ain't a game, I ain't a joke and 
 I got change I ain't broke and 
 I ain't sweet neither, I got beat heaters, 
 And I keep divas, meat beaters, 
 The fever, lift your sole like cheap sneakers, 
 And I hit cats wit the ax and meat cleavers, 
 And I have ya ass stashed in the deep freezer, 
 And the squad that I ride wit is heat squeezers, 
 On some get cake shit, my album a problem this jus my mixtape shit (bitch)
