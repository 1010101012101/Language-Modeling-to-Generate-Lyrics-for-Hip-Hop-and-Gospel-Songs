Back against tha wall

 Back against tha wall (x3) 
 CASSIDY verse 1 
 Life is cruel but you could choose your life 
 And if you don't make tha right moves you could lose your life 
 And that ain't cool 
 There's rules you gotta use in life 
 But I'll make tha news tryin' to get some food to bite 
 Dudes drool when they see my jewls cubes of ice 
 So I don't go no where without tha tools at night (RIGHT) 
 This for my niggaz that's tryin' to choose they 
 And my sistas that's tryin' to choose the dudes they like 
 They call all men dogs but y'all prove 'em right 
 Until they get confused and wanna choose a dike 
 And your right hand man that you refuse to fight 
 Might stab you in tha back but wont use a knife (RIGHT) 
 Don't get it confused I move tha white 
 I get cream from tha feinds that abuse tha pipe 
 I like money, guns, ice and slot of k 
 So stress is tha price I guess I gotta pay 
 Ill b back wit verse 2
