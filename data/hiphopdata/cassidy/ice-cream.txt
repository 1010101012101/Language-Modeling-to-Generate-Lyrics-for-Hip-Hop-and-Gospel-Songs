Everything I write nice, but I freestyle err day tho 
 Money ain't nothin' I'm husslin wild yayo 
 I stay on my J-O 
 I play tha passenger side of tha geene 
 Eatin fettucini alfredo 
 My chick ass fat but her waist like J-Lo 
 I ball but not in tha leauge like A/O 
 No way yo 
 I get mine soft like play dough 
 My coke off white like mayo 
 Yo you betta lay low for you get laid down 
 Whole lotta cats that had heart in tha grave now 
 Whole lotta cats that was smart is in tha cage now 
 That's why I stays wit my pound don't put my blade down 
 I'm paid now I got G's wit me 
 I can't rely on security to sqeeze for me 
 Cause believe when you me 
 When tha chrome to ya dome ocky 
 Ya body guards gon be tryin' to gurad they own 
 I could ride tha best verse you heard in ya life 
 Then rip it up 
 Ya greatest hits like mixtape shit to us 
 Stay wit a spliff in the cup stay twistin up 
 Liquored up off tha hawk I henney an hip it up 
 An my wrist man I lit it up 
 My bezel got so many pebbles bam-bam couldn't lift it up 
 But try an stick me up blam blam stiffin up 
 Ain't no stitchin up them holes 
 Ya soul liftin up 
 But I'm still pitchin on tha stove whippin up 
 Thinkin' 'bout them franklins stinkin tha kitchen up 
 Yup I be dealin' an fillin them coke bags 
 But been ill wit tha pencil an notepad 
 I been hot from the start 
 An I ain't just a battle rapper 
 Hotel on tha top of the chart 
 I'm dealin' weight got real estate 
 An go shoppin' for art
