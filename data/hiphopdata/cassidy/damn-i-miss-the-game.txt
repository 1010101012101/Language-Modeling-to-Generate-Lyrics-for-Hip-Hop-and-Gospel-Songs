(Feat. Rell) 
 Damn I miss the, Damn I miss the, Damn I miss the Game Game 
 When it's gone come back, come back? 
 I'm gettin' tired of the dumb rap dumb rap 
 Man I done been there and done that 
 Let's move on 
 Damn I used to love this rap shit 
 (I used loved it) 
 When it was on some gold robe, cane, gold hat shit 
 Now every rapper on some bust the gat shit 
 Cut that crack shit 
 Fuck that wack shit 
 Public Enemy was on some power to black shit 
 Rap cats need to get back on that shit 
 (Real talk) 
 They need to try switchin they flows 
 Cause all of our women ain't bitches and hoes 
 And er'y rapper out got a brick on the stove 
 And wrists all frooze, and whip on roads 
 To hear that, I can listen to Hov 
 You bullshittin then you gettin' exposed 
 Damn I miss the, Damn I miss the, Damn I miss the Game Game 
 Whens it's gone come back, come back? 
 I'm gettin' tired of the dumb rap dumb rap 
 Man I done been there and done that 
 Let's move on 
 Yo what happened to the game? 
 All these niggas rappin' the same and that's lame 
 (That's lame) 
 Cats hustlin, bustin' they gat 
 Curtis Blow never talked about hustlin crack 
 (No) 
 Yo, Ev'rybody on the grind 
 But Run DMC never killed nobody in a rhyme 
 They wasn't on that beef shit 
 And Melle Mel was the first one to talk that street shit 
 Ever since NWA came out 
 Cats turned gangsta and took that same rout 
 (Man) 
 Ya hear that I could listen to Pac 
 You bullshitin the mission'll stop 
 Damn I miss the, Damn I miss the, Damn I miss the Game Game 
 When it's gone come back, come back 
 I'm gettin' tired of the dumb rap dumb rap 
 Man I done been there and done that 
 Let's move on 
 I don't even listen to rap now (nope) 
 It make my head hurt when I listen to cats now 
 It sound like they all rhymin in one booth 
 So take the industry 'n' put them all in one group 
 Since they all on the same page 
 We should be able to boo them dudes off the same stage (boooo) 
 For real, I still love this rap shit 
 Even though the A wanna whip that snap shit 
 Even though the Bay wanna rip that hyphy 
 When I get on the mic niggas still gone like me 
 The head crack[? ], you can listen to me 
 You bullshitin you ain't sicker than me 
 Damn I miss the, Damn I miss the, Damn I miss the Game Game 
 When it's gone come back, come back? 
 I'm gettin' tired of the dumb rap dumb rap 
 Man I done been there and done that 
 Let's move on
