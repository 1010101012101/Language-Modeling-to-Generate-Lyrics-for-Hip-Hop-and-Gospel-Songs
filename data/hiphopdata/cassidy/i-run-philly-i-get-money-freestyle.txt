 I... I Get It,

 Yeah, Yeah, I Run Philly! 
 All you niggas know I'm gettin' tha bread 
 Cause everything I spill I'll I'm kinda sick to my head 
 And my grip so big even if it hit you fingertips 
 You'd be dead but you get hit in your head p-lat 
 'Cause I ain't from tha city of suckas 
 Philly is tha city of plenty of gun busters 
 And I go by the name of tha hustler 
 Imy life rough but I seen niggas with rougher 
 I'm not a liar, kniever or bluffer 
 I'm ballin but be in tha street just like tha rucker 
 And this nothin' new this what I do 
 Then crossed over like skip to my lou 
 And you can bet it all in a battle I never lost 
 Because I was never soft I'm a preditor I set it off 
 You know tha feds involved we sprayin tha letty volve 
 And I'm marryin my gun I ain't callin tha weddin off 
 Never y'all and my fiance my gat you can say we been attached 
 Since way way back it's like I can't stay away 
 Every day I'm strapped they say tha mac go p-ling 
 But tha k go p-lac when I was locked in tha cling you 
 Was better off whatever I said it y'all it ain't nothin' to set it off 
 And if it's beef it ain't nothin' to let it off 
 Big small short tall I'm like it's whatever y'all 
 I'm a boss I got cheddar to floss 
 I don't look at tha price because whatever it cost I got it y'all
