 Verse 1: blow the fuckin' whistle 
 I'm on my fuckin' grizzle 
 Tryin' to make a dolla out a dime and a fuckin' nickel 
 I'll knuckle with ya but I got a couple pistols 
 If they fuckin' hit uu be dead or a fuckin' cripple 
 I'm just fuckin' wit u I ain't gone bust a pistol 
 'Cause I'm on parolle 
 And I ain't trying to get fuckin' pickled 
 I call my gat acrobat 'cause it will fuckin' flip u 
 Stuff you in a box like some fuckin' tissue 
 If you cats got nine lives 
 I hope brought a couple wit u 
 Or you won't liveya relatives gone fuckin' miss u 
 If you rat I ain't fuckin' wit u 
 I wouldn't even tell 
 If I seen bin laden buying a fuckin' missile 
 If u a snitch I'll come and get u 
 Take ya life and the life of the rest 
 Of the mice runnin' wit u 
 If you pack gats then I'm fuckin' wit u 
 But if you live by the gun 
 You gone die by the fuckin' pistol 
 (Chorus) if the DA ask me to tell I'm like uh huh 
 They like you wanna go back to jail I'm likeuhhuh 
 Stay with the apes and co's I'm like uh huh 
 I like to clap gats but my p.o. like uh huh 
 I seen the jail I will never tell uh huh 
 Keep ya deal I will never squeal uh huh 
 I wanna walk but I never talk uh huh 
 And that's that I will never ratuh huh) 
 Verse 2: you ain't a killa yet 
 You ain't a guerilla yet 
 I bang like I'm at the range 
 And you can be the silouette 
 Yeah I'm still a threat 
 U can still feel a heck 
 The lead a put ya to bed 
 'Cause you soft like a pillow set 
 U pussy's is sweet 
 I'll put ya to sleep 
 The bullets I put in the heat 
 A put ya face on ya feet 
 U can look in my face and see you facin defeat 
 Its basically beef 
 Don't let me see ya face in the street 
 U better stand on the pavement 
 U ain't safe in the street 
 I'm flippin weight in the street 
 I get cake in the street 
 So what you make in a year 
 I can make in a week 
 Or probably a couple hours... 
 I'm gettin' a couple dollars 
 All I'm doin' is takin' a beat 
 And then speakin' the truth on it 
 Like dr.king with a speech 
 Man you snitches conversate with police 
 But it's a difference between a lake and a beach 
 And a grape and a peach motherfucka 
 Chorus: if the DA ask me to tell I'm like uh huh 
 They like you wanna go back to jail I'm likeuh huh 
 Stay with the apes and co's I'm like uh huh 
 I like to clap gats but my p.o. like uh huh 
 I seen the jail I will never tell uh huh 
 Keep ya deal I will never squeal uh huh 
 I wanna walk but I never talk uh huh 
 And that's that I will never ratuh huh 
 Verse 3: I said you cats rat 
 Like the mask on ninja turtles 
 I was being nice 
 'Cause you mice bout as big as gerbels 
 Lil hamster guiena pig type niggas 
 Who be givin' information to the pigs 
 With the quickness 
 Them kids snitches they'll try to ride against u 
 Then sign a subpoena and testify against u 
 Go to jail never that 
 Take a deal never that 
 Squeal never that 
 That's that 
 I will never rat
