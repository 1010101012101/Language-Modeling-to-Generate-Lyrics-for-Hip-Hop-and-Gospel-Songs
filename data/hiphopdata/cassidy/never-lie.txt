 I've seen some things some people never get to see 
 I've sold drugs couse you can't get shit for free 
 Give a brick to me I'll show you how to flip a G 
 I don't no a bi who can really go quick as me 
 I use to go to the drive through at micky d 
 An only chick with me feedin me chicken frickacy 
 I was gridin now I'm shinnin like a christmas tree 
 Ya I wear a lot of chains like mr t 
 See some hatters gettin' sick of me talk about my acsadent an I don't let it get to me I suffer brain damage mentaly and physically so my recovery was almost scientificly 
 I rap about gun but you no my history you might have seen what I've done on unsolved mystery 
 Missery love commpony that's the reson there's it's bunch of you and only one of me 
 Y'all see what I've done for free I've never been the gimic I'm a finnik and I don't wanna be I got the top spot ain't no boddy under me if I anint in your top 5 fuck it I don't wanna be 
 Couse your done with me nothin' but an idiot stupid good for nothin' fuck indiginuet been the bitch trinna get tough hold up one conversation a hole shit swole up 
 Some times I rap about god but so what the lord open up doors no one can close up 
 I started off at the bottem but I rose up 
 I only went gold no I never sold much 
 But so what I ant makin' no excuses 
 I need the beats but now you can't hate on my producers 
 Top notch finalists hatten om the useless 
 Couse you no I'm bull sick I'm back on my bull shit
