Wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy 
 (Hey, what up girl?) 
 Put my glasses on, I'm out the door - I'm gonna hit this city 
 (Let's go) 
 Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack 
 'Cause when I leave for the night, I ain't coming back 
 I'm talking - pedicure on our toes, toes 
 Trying on all our clothes, clothes 
 Boys blowing up our phones, phones 
 Drop-toping, playing our favorite cds 
 Pulling up to the parties 
 Trying to get a little bit tipsy 
 Don't stop, make it pop 
 DJ, blow my speakers up 
 Tonight, I?mma fight 
 Till we see the sunlight 
 Tick tock, on the clock 
 But the party don't stop no 
 Whoa-oh oh oh 
 Whoa-oh oh oh 
 Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of beer 
 Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm already here 
 Now, the dudes are lining up 'cause they hear we got swagger 
 But we kick 'em to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger 
 I'm talking about - everybody getting crunk, crunk 
 Boys trying to touch my junk, junk 
 Gonna smack him if he getting too drunk, drunk 
 Now, now - we goin' till they kick us out, out 
 Or the police shut us down, down 
 Police shut us down, down 
 Po-po shut us - 
 Don't stop, make it pop 
 DJ, blow my speakers up 
 Tonight, I?mma fight 
 Till we see the sunlight 
 Tick tock, on the clock 
 But the party don't stop no 
 Whoa-oh oh oh 
 Whoa-oh oh oh 
 Don't stop, make it pop 
 DJ, blow my speakers up 
 Tonight, I?mma fight 
 Till we see the sunlight 
 Tick tock, on the clock 
 But the party don't stop no 
 Whoa-oh oh oh 
 Whoa-oh oh oh 
 DJ, you build me up 
 You break me down 
 My heart, it pounds 
 Yeah, you got me 
 With my hands up 
 You got me now 
 You gotta that sound 
 Yeah, you got me 
 DJ, you build me up 
 You break me down 
 My heart, it pounds 
 Yeah, you got me 
 With my hands up 
 Get your hands up 
 Put your hands up 
 No, the party don't start until I walk in 
 Don't stop, make it pop 
 DJ, blow my speakers up 
 Tonight, I?mma fight 
 Till we see the sunlight 
 Tick tock, on the clock 
 But the party don't stop no 
 Whoa-oh oh oh 
 Whoa-oh oh oh 
 Don't stop, make it pop 
 DJ, blow my speakers up 
 Tonight, I?mma fight 
 Till we see the sunlight 
 Tick tock, on the clock 
 But the party don't stop no 
 Whoa-oh oh oh 
 Whoa-oh oh oh
