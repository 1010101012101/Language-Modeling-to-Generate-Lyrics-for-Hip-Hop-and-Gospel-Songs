Tha Hustla... Larsency Family... Crossover 
 I serve Fiends, Before I became a man 
 But sellin cocaine wasn't part of the gameplan 
 I was rappin' on stages before you cats was originated, 
 Before autotune and that bullcrap was created 
 When I grabbed the mic and tried to spit my rhymes 
 They said I couldn't, they wouldn't let me get my shine 
 Cool... 'cause I ain't get upset, 
 I lit a dutch, found a chicken to fuck and I left 
 To the hotel, she said she likes the weed she smells 
 And I was rollin' L after L 
 1 after after another 1 and I rolled another 1, 
 To much dutchies I'm gone need another lung, 
 I blaze haze but I don't fiend for nicotine, 
 'Cause I don't smoke cigarettes, just the green 
 I'm blazin', lightin up the haze and don't I look asian 
 The bud I'm smokin' is amazin 
 Kush sour, grandfather and the piff it'll 
 Have you twisted that's the reason I twist it 
 It'll get you twice as high if you try to mix it 
 Higher than your rent bill when your gettin' evicted 
 Rhymes overflowin, imma get dough and, 
 I'm blessed si I guess that's why my rhymes coincide... 
 With my thoughts in god, I gotta thank him that he kept me alive 
 The invincible microphone fiend that's me 
 Cassidy, there's no match for me 
 E-F-F-E-C-T, I need my R-E-S-P-E-C-T 
 'Cause cass is a problem, I gotta have it 
 And your retarded plus you're a fagget 
 My DJ gotta microphone his name thorough 
 And I'm dope with the microphone like heroine 
 I make the bass flip, you need a fix 
 Gimme some soda, some ice, and a brick 
 I whip, wait till it cool, n cut with the razor I made ya, 
 If you fuckin' with me you touch paper 
 Middle fingers up fuck haters 
 I keep the weapon, get assassinated when them guns up haters 
 See a part me people at home never seen 
 When I'm feinin for a microphone, imma microphone fiend 
 After 12, I'm worse than dracula, 
 Turnin' pages in my rap book, I need a spatula 
 That's intense, I'm convinced you terrified 
 You see the barrel size, u gunna die or be paralized 
 By any means necessary, this is what has to be done 
 Make way 'cause here cass come 
 My DJ cut material material material material 
 N he'll bury u 
 It's a must that I crush any mic you hand to me 
 Its inherited, it runs in my family 
 I wrote the most rhymes, I wrote the most raps, 
 But my dad could rhyme and my mom had dope raps 
 Now I don't wanna have to pop off 'n' bust a shot off 
 If you can't keep the stage warm, then hop off 
 Ladies and gentlemen, ur about to see 
 Me the best in the game imma bout to be 
 Take it to the maximum, I can't relax and um 
 So coca cola on ice mixed wit yak is 1 
 Hell of a the antidote and hella the damn smoke 
 You wanna roll a gram of the smoke but you can't you broke 
 You makin' me crack up, u shouldv'e stacked up 
 Those who act up need to get more than clapped up 
 Any entertainer I got 1 in the chamber 
 2 take away 1 and I'm the remainder 
 So close your eyes and hold ur fuckin' breath 
 And imma squezze till there's nothing fuckin' left 
 Before you go you gunna know that you've seen 
 A fiend on the microphone, imma microphone fiend
