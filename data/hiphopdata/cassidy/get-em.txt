Intro: they ready for the kid to say lay yeah 
 This the boy cassidy man and I'm feelin' like a red nose that we just let outta the cage man, I'm ready to bite any one of you niggas at any given moment (get em) 
 My shit is the truth 
 I get in the booth 
 And start spittin' 
 Like I'm missin' a tooth 
 U listenin dude 
 I'm grippin the coop 
 Liftin the rippin 
 Sip the orange juice mixed wit the goose 
 Wit shots of the yat 
 I got gats 
 That can lift up a moose 
 Stay wit the biscuit to shoot 
 Like I'm bishop and juice 
 I get more bitches than luke 
 When I run the block 
 Fiends scream I want a rock I want a rock 
 I'm writtin a curbe 
 Bitin the herb 
 And I got a nice price on the birds 
 U might could get served 
 You come wit the dough 
 Ill come wit the blow 
 But if you don't come wit the change 
 I'll come wit them thangs 
 Run up on you wit the gun in the dickie 
 The calicoe hold a hundred and fifty 
 U wanna get busy 
 Come get me 
 I'll bury you cats 
 'Cause I'll wife the knife 
 And I marry my gats 
 Get 'em get 'em get 'em get 'em get cass (4x) 
 A yo my flow sick 
 I need a anneistermean 
 Both of my wrists gleam 
 And my fish just as mean 
 Its blue 
 But its see through like listerene 
 I get the cream on the strip 
 Fuckin' wit the fiends 
 So go and get ya team 
 And I'll get 'em all smoked 
 Like a stick of nocatine 
 Or a nick of green 
 And I don't talk to these hoes 
 Like I'm mr bean 
 I just let 'em mop me off 
 Get a mt clean 
 And I might pop her off if the chick is mean 
 I got some stories I can tell 
 To sell a chick a dream 
 I let her sip a little liquor 
 Let her hit the green 
 Then imma unbutton her blouse 
 And unzip her jeans 
 And merk that ass 
 Hurt that ass 
 Cass show u 
 How to work that ass 
 And I ain't wit my boy kells 
 In the hotel no more 
 I'm on the strip 
 Makin' sells fish tail galore 
 I'm still actin' a fool 
 Packin a tool 
 Go back to the dude I was 
 Before the plaques and the jewels 
 I don't feel right if I ain't 
 Strapped with the tool 
 But give me a gat and I'm cool 
 Like the mack or the uz 
 And I'll clap at you dude 
 I ain't scrappin you dudes 
 I'm highlightin 
 I ain't fightin 
 I got ratchets to use 
 I have cats like 
 Damn yo what happened to dude 
 Listen homey if I'm hungry 
 You get jacked for yo food 
 I'm back on the move 
 Back on the grind 
 I'm a natural born hustler 
 I just happen to ryhme 
 Who woulda ever thought 
 I'll be the cat to get signed 
 But life hard and predictin 
 Shit happen sometimes 
 Cats jackin my lines 
 Takin' my style 
 But ain't no perpatraitors allowed 
 If you die then you can't testify 
 When I take it to trial 
 U can hate it I'll just take it and smile
