 Ain't nothing changed but the name on the mail 
 Still kicking doors with them thangs in the air 
 Open Benny Honda, see me slang in dem chair

 Do it like a ball playa, when you see me ballin 
 Stacks tall-ass ball playa from the stage to the air 
 Whether in Miami, Cincinnati or in Riverdale 
 Arizona, California, make it rain anywhere 
 Pullin out that pistol nigga who you think you finna scare? 
 20 rounds of missles have you pissin in your underwear 
 I tote a pound, 40 cal, so you better tone it down 
 I suggest you adjust the bass, except for when it going down 
 A-town, west side club, you should catch me, 
 Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro and Mac be 
 Jackers lying say they caught me slipping how could that be 
 I'm something like a stalker I be everywhere the strap be 
 The trap be, jumping with that 100 dollar slab 
 If I wanted nigga I could get 100 on the tab 
 Sell 'em all double down Nigga do the math 
 Think I won't pull up in something With 200 on the dash

 I Do it for my nigga phil daughter and his momma too 
 Do it for my oldest sons and they Grand momma too 
 Do it for my daughters and my my youngest lil momma who 
 Go buy what she want 'cause she know it ain't a problem to.
