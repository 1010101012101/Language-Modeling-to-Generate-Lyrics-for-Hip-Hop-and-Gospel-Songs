(Feat. Stones) 
 Smothe the hustler speaks 
 (Verse one) 
 Imma do it how I was meant to do it 
 A wise man told me first you feel the music then you get your flow into it 
 Next bk great in the making 
 Follow me through a limitless journey of domination 
 This is volume one of a timeless compilation 
 Perfect combination of faith and determintaion 
 And with that equation you'll witness the new invasion 
 Of the hip hop industry which the fans are awaiting 
 In the background's where I have bee chilling patient 
 Now I guess you could call this my presentation 
 To be the spokesman for the entire urban nation 
 Brother figure to the young, provide motivation 
 Lead 'em to the promise land off modern plantations 
 And from this day forth I swear to my resignation 
 I be the hottest nigga out of my generation 
 Making stones, pac, b.i.g., and jay adjacent 
 I don't think you niggas get it 
 I'm bout to be one of the best that ever did it I spit it because I live it 
 This my life homey this is not a gimmick 
 So you could either watch from a far or get wit it 
 (Repaet 1x) 
 (Verse two) 
 Touch not perform digital miricales on my visual lyricals 
 They say the way this kid spit it should be biblical 
 It's so original ya niggas is typical 
 You better step your game up it's getting critical 
 I know you spitting too but I'm not hearing you 
 I don't listen to ya niggas you pitiful 
 You sound miserable talking bout what you wish you do 
 You would'nt know hip hop if you was introduced 
 Naw dog you could hang if you was in a noose 
 I don't mess with you whack rappers so vamoose (fuck outta here) poof 
 You a liar I'm the truth 
 (How could I put it) 
 You a van I'm a coupe 
 Good and bad is the difference between me and you 
 This is sad how I gotta get it through to you 
 I be stones and I stand alone tell the king I'm coming after that throne (I'm coming for that thone) 
 (Verse three) 
 It's aot of niggas rapping to rap cause rapping is rapping 
 Steady running they yap but not making it happen 
 Talking 'bout how they trap and the gats they packing 
 They albums like a movie jam-packed with action 
 That's why I'm laughing 'cause I did the math and 
 It ain't adding up so I know that they acting 
 It ain't bad enough that they spitting that whack shit 
 But now your boy stones on the scene with that straight piff 
 I make it hard for these rappers to manage 
 Cause every time I spit a sixteen it do damage 
 And every time they spit a sixteen it just land in a category as a rhyme we have trouble understanding 
 That's because it's a whole bunch of nothing 
 A whole bunch of stunting 
 A whole bunch of fronting 
 A whole bunch of bluffing 
 A whole bunch of cussing 
 Which leads us back to a whole bunch of nothing 
 My music is raising the standards of the public 
 So you better tell your manager to raise your budget 
 Cause them lyrics that you spitting just ain't gon cut it 
 You gon need a fucking high price beat or something
