Yo if you want to go to war, it's all right 
 Well if you ain't hardcore, it's all right 
 You want to get it on nigga, it's all right 
 It's all right (it's all right), It's all right (it's all right) 
 Yo if you want to go to war, it's all right 
 Well if you ain't hardcore, it's all right 
 You want to get it on nigga, it's all right 
 It's all right (it's all right), It's all right (it's all right) 
 I got a problem with fuck niggas 
 Always talkin' shit and try to duck niggas 
 Sucker niggas won't finish what they started 
 Be coppin' dueces cause them niggas soft-hearted 
 They straight bitches 
 Always puttin' on shows for these niggas and hoes 
 Be wantin' to run your mouth but won't throw no blows 
 Ain't got no scrap, better kill that rap 
 Think life is a game, until that ass get tapped 
 And when it do, what you do, you run like a bitch 
 Or do you straight turn state on a nigga and snitch 
 When you ain't got your boys, you ain't got no balls 
 And you ain't gangsta with all them 911 calls 
 Real niggas don't call police 
 Real niggas handle theirs when they got beef 
 Flawed niggas talk shit and know they can't back it 
 Know they ain't real but always trying to act it 
 Yo if you want to go to war, it's all right 
 Well if you ain't hardcore, it's all right 
 You want to get it on nigga, it's all right 
 It's all right (it's all right), It's all right (it's all right) 
 I'm the original jacker, flawed boy attacker 
 Taking your life ain't nothing but a factor 
 Matter of fact, I'm a killer straight out the slums 
 No time to dump, I got these pumps for you chumps 
 And I ain't talking bout' the reeboks 
 Getting three glocks and jumping out of treetops 
 Making suckers flee spots, and leave knots 
 Got guns, get funds, yeah I'm packing styles 
 Suckers acting foul, get smoked like Black and Milds 
 Nigga know a plan, laying down this thing 
 Beyond all that rap shit, I only spit game 
 You scared, say you scared, but just peep what I said 
 I'm so wicked off the head, probably shoot out of dread 
 That's right, all you suckers better recognize 
 Before I start recognizing, ain't gonna have you niggas sweatin' mine 
 I'm in this thang for real, ain't nothing fake here 
 Putting down in the zone with my nigga Shakespeare 
 Yo if you want to go to war, it's all right 
 Well if you ain't hardcore, it's all right 
 You want to get it on nigga, it's all right 
 It's all right (it's all right) 
 It's all right (it's all right) 
 I wear my hat low, when I walk through a circle of folks I don't know 
 It ain't to much chalk in these streets that can hold me back 
 I make stacks and stacks, for the weeks and weeks I got slapped 
 Freaks, I got the grill with the white gold 
 Keep a pistol in my hand with the tight hold 
 From the city where they drop blows 
 Known to pin-hold down off them figure fours 
 Shit shady, we all about to bust on sight, lighting up the night 
 Putting hoes off in 74's and watching em' all blow 
 It ain't shit funny, it's the money man and Gipp 
 Holding sawed-off pumps in your face chump 
 Don't disrespect the city, streets, that I'm standing on 
 Niggas from Miami and Atlanta holdin' heat 
 It ain't nothing happy 
 You see, it ain't all about that rapping 
 Yo if you want to go to war, it's all right 
 Well if you ain't hardcore, it's all right 
 You want to get it on nigga, it's all right 
 It's all right (it's all right), It's all right (it's all right) 
 Straight up and down, I'm a let you fuck nigga know 
 You niggas don't want war, talking all that shit 
 Cause you apted up on that motherfucking tough guy juice 
 Get round' the motherfucking boys, listen to this goddamn rap music 
 And niggas think it's a motherfucking game 
 All right, play with it 
 Jt Money, Big Gipp, let you niggas know 
 Yo if you want to go to war, it's all right 
 Well if you ain't hardcore, it's all right 
 You want to get it on nigga, it's all right 
 It's all right (it's all right), It's all right (it's all right)
