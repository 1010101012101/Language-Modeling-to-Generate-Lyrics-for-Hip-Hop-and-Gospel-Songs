Steal you wit my 2 shot 
 Control you wit my drop 
 Blaze you wit my handle 
 Bless you wit my pops 
 Play you like a pro 
 And take over the show 
 Stick you and defeat u 
 Rob you of your glow 
 Rob you of your glow 
 Bring the drama playa 
 Give me all you got 
 Make your move 
 Shoot your best shot 
 I see right through your riddle 
 Slip right past the block 
 Set you up 4 2 
 Shoot your best shot 
 Shoot your best shot 
 We're the playas number 1 (x 3) 
 Playa playa play me 
 We dyin' to set it off 
 Marlo, slick and weasel 
 Can hardly wait to ball 
 My groove is tight drummers 
 Drummin right 
 Dirts our secret weapon 
 Each and everynight 
 Each and everynight 
 We came here to rip shit 
 Strip you of your clout 
 Later for all y'all 
 We gon turn this motha out 
 If you came to ball you gon lose it all 
 Wedont plan to stop 
 Till you bounce off tha wall 
 Till you bouncin' off tha wall 
 We're the playas number 1 (x 3)
