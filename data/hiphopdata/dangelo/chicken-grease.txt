Let me tell ya 'bout the chicken grease 
 Stuffs and things to make the people get out ya seat 
 Everybody its cool if you wanna clap your hands and stomp ya feet 
 Come on down to the front where you can feel the beat 
 From the left to the right, the back the middle and the front 
 Don't be uptight shake it off do what you want 
 Pump it in the club get a little bit a rub-a-dub 
 I know you love me 'cause I'm funky 'cause I jus wanna show you some love 
 Chicken grease chicken grease 
 2 get 2 the otha side 
 Y'all cross the road 
 But not the kid 
 See I'm like that old bucket of crisco 
 That's sitting on top of the stove 
 Simmer to a sizzle like the days of old 
 But I'll wait till I've mastered this 
 Let the others go first 
 So the brothers wont miss 
 Fried till its burned and crisp 
 Say we be cooking so the funksters can raise their fist like this 
 Now you know how its goin' down 
 Start at your neck then through your back 
 Then it works its way down 2 ur feet 
 So unique come on everybody lets dance to the beat 
 I jus wanna put you down 
 I just want y'all to get down 
 Everybody come on and get down 2 the chicken grease 
 If you wanna come on down to the front 
 Baby yo its cool everybody fakin the funk 
 Ima put you in skool 
 Take a lesson from adolescent 2 man 
 I got the music and the instruments use 'em as my weapons at hand 
 Everybody on the floor if you listening to me 
 Clap your hands stomp your feet 
 I just wanna put you down 
 I jus want y'all to get down 
 Everybody come on and get down 2 the chicken grease 
 Chicken grease 
 Chicken grease
