Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 It's not warm when she's away 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 And she always gone too long 
 Anytime she goes away 
 Wonder this time where she's gone 
 Wonder if she's gonna stay 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 And this house just ain't no home 
 Anytime she goes away 
 And I know (repeat I know 20 more times) 
 Hey ya auta leave the young thing alone 
 But ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 Only darkness every day 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 And this house just ain't no home 
 Anytime she goes away 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 It's not warm when she's away 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
 And she's always gone too long 
 Anytime she goes away 
 Anytime she goes away 
 Anytime she goes away 
 Anytime she goes away 
 Anytime she goes away
