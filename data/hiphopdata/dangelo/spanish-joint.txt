Whenever it rains I feel this way 
 A little sumthing 2 get me thorugh this 
 Give me a little that, no time flat 
 Gonna be a good thing 
 Serene but in need of feelin' free 
 Letting go and landing on my feet 
 Brushed the dirt off my back no time flat 
 Gonna be a good thing 
 Well people believe this saying is true 
 Whatever will b will forever do 
 Whatever the cost I'll pay in full 
 I ain't got nothin' to do with you 
 Gotta get out gotta get out of here 
 I'm in the dark and the light looks sincere 
 Brushed the dirt off my back no time flat 
 Gonna be a good thing 
 All you do is complain about your pain 
 And the cloud that follows you won't cease to rain 
 Don't look back handle that 
 Make it into a good thing 
 Something up in me gotta be 
 Sole controller in control of me 
 A link in your chain just wont do 
 I don't want nothin' to do with you
