Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo 
 My flows remarkable, Doc walk like Kane 
 From Kung Fu 'round the globe 
 Throw obstacles, I'll hurdle them 
 Herb and whack MC's 
 Drum racks to the rims, to the caps 
 Yo Meth, Tical and D, I'm ASAP 
 I'm crack a don chicken hunting at KFC 
 In '83, I was that scrub TLC talking 'bout 
 Now I rock the house, chalk 'em out 
 Yeah, no doubt who gots the biggest ass in the house? 
 Young miss fillet a fish, salt water trout 
 Pretty young thing got a tongue ring and dirty mouth 
 And she whispering them sweet nothings 
 I hear it out, I hear it out 
 Baby you got me like Joni had Cha Chi 
 Until she got high and went and fucked Potsi 
 Lady Godiva, from day one a dick rider 
 Liar, liar set your pussy on fire 
 I see you dancing right now 
 I don't need to tell you that you know how 
 Baby, you do, I say you belong 
 And if you dream, you'd be free 
 I can take you there just follow me 
 Baby I won't, I won't steer you wrong 
 And it seems like to me 
 You want someone to treat you like their queen 
 Babe, I do, so what'cha want? 
 Smack your ass, pull your hair 
 And I even kiss you way down there 
 You know, I will, think I won't? 
 That's the way we do it, left and right 
 Keep it moving, up and down 
 How we do it, babe, left and right

 Yeah, I hear you calling my world 
 Make you feel like a pearl 
 I'll rub your back and fulfill your needs 
 So I would suggest you get undressed 
 Fingertips touching and you'll come back 
 As I want, why don't you give it to me? 
 I will have you believe 
 There's no reason for you to leave 
 Stay right here, stay right here 
 In my arms, in my arms 
 Bring you fears stay secure 
 Here with me you can be sure 
 There's no faking, you turn me on 
 That's the way we do it 
 Left and right, up and down

 Yo Doc, be off the wall, we keep a Marley cheap 
 Pulling a Harley deep with a jar of grease 
 Come 151, straight endo, the spot 
 I fuck brown sugar behind the fiber glass window 
 It's Doc, pack guns, don't sling weight 
 The only thing I sling is condoms for spring break 
 Fuck 'em, how we do it? 
 Leave 'em, how we do it? 
 Get the money, the pussy 
 The weed, now do it 
 Now take your coat off and stay a while 
 Now honey child, if you're gon' be acting funny style 
 Then I don't need ya 
 It's Saturday, this night fever 
 Shit is popping, Acheeva my mouth cotton 
 Tis the season for draws dropping and heavy breathing 
 You ain't skeezin', you dick teasin', I'm leavin' 
 Acting rotten, I got no time for games, I'm no joke 
 Drop that ass when I'm finished and watch it smoke 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
