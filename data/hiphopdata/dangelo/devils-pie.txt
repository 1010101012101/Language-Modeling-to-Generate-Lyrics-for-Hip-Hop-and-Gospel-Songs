Fuck the slice, want the pie 
 Why ask why till we fry 
 Watch us all stand in line 
 For a slice of the devil's pie 
 Drugs and thugs, women and wine 
 Three or four at a time 
 Watch them all stand in line 
 For a slice of the devil's pie 
 Who am I to justify 
 All the evil in our eye 
 When I myself feel the high 
 From all that I despise 
 Behind the jail or in the grave 
 I have to lay in this bed I made 
 And if I die before I wake 
 I hope the Lord don't hesitate 
 To get to heaven, I went through hell 
 Tell my peeps all is well 
 And all them fools whose soul's for sale 
 Sitting next to the jezebel 
 Demons screaming in my ear 
 All my anger, all my fear 
 If I holler, let them hear 
 In this spinning sphere 
 Fuck the slice, want the pie 
 Why ask why till we fry 
 Watch us all stand in line 
 For a slice of the devil's pie 
 Drugs and thugs, women and wine 
 Three or four at a time 
 Watch them all stand in line 
 For a slice of the devil's pie 
 Main ingredients to this dish 
 Goes like this, here's the list 
 Materialistic, greed and lust 
 Jealousy, envious 
 Bread and dough, cheddar cheese 
 Flash and stash, cash and cream 
 Temperature, high degree 
 Niggas come to feast 
 Hell is this all about 
 Apocalypse, ain't no doubt 
 Everybody's ho'ing out 
 All the loot, all the clout 
 Right or wrong, we do or die 
 Only vengeance will pacify 
 Watch your back, so will I 
 In these days and time 
 Fuck the slice, want the pie 
 Why ask why till we fry 
 Watch us all stand in line 
 For a slice of the devil's pie 
 Drugs and thugs, women and wine 
 Three or four at a time 
 Watch them all stand in line 
 For a slice of the devil's pie 
 Ain't no justice, just us 
 Ashes to ashes, dust to dust 
 Time has come for most of us 
 To choose in which god we trust 
 I know I born to die 
 Search to find some peace of mind 
 With 85, dumb and blind 
 There can be no compromise 
 Fuck the slice, want the pie 
 Why ask why till we fry 
 Watch us all stand in line 
 For a slice of the devil's pie 
 Drugs and thugs, women and wine 
 Three or four at a time
