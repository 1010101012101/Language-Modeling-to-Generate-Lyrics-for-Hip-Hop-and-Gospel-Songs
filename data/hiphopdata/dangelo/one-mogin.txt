I know some things have changed since the last 
 I've seen you, some good, some for the bad 
 All and all I can't complain that's what I've been through, baby 
 But seeing you reminds me of the precious times we had 
 I wondered all this time 'bout how you been 
 And I hoped by chance, I'd see you once again 
 I'd love to kiss your lips, baby, once again 
 Long to hold you tight, girl, one mo' gin 
 I know you got someone, I got somebody too 
 But I'm unhappy and I miss the shit we used to do 
 I miss your smile, your mouth, your laughter, baby 
 I never bumped into your kind before or after 
 I wondered all this time 'bout how you been 
 And I hoped by chance I'd see you once again 
 I'd love to kiss your lips, baby, once again 
 Long to hold you tight, girl, one mo' gin 
 I know you gotta be gettin' back to your own thing 
 Baby, you got yours I got mine 
 I hope you know that you could call me, girl, when things change 
 If you want to we could catch up on some lost time 
 I wondered all this time 'bout how you been 
 And I hoped by chance I'd see you once again 
 I'd love to kiss your lips, baby, once again 
 Long to hold you tight, girl, one mo' gin
