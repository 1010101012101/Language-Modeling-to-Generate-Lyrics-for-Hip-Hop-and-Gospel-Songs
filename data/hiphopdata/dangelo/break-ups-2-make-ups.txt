(Method Man) You and I, till the day we die... (day we die..) 
 Yo, yo Ex-girlfriend, how you been? I see you still 
 Tryin' to fuck with other women men, remember when 
 I first met you in my cousin's house, a week later 
 We was fuckin' on your momma couch, now it's been said 
 That big girls they don't cry, but they damn sure lie 
 Look you in the eye, sayin' you they only 
 You and I, till the day we die, said you'd never 
 Leave me lonely, fly tenderoni but you phony 
 Shoulda listened when my momma told me, soon as I 
 Turn my back you try to fuck my homies, that was then 
 This is now I got a new friend, ever since 
 I cut them loose ends you wanna bone me 
 Add strife to my life, pussy that'll make me think twice 
 About leavin' the wife even, picture that 
 You ain't want me when you had me, now you on 
 Your third baby daddy, and you hate to see a nigga happy 
 So you tryin' mad ways to trap me, lookin' at my girl nasty 
 Tryin' to throw the pussy at me 
 "Now look at this bitch over here tryin' to act like me" 
 "Uh-huh, fuck that bitch, she must like leftovers 
 "(D'Angelo) 
 I'm still in love with babe (8X) 
 (Method Man) 
 Yo yo It's always you and your crusty ass crew, be actin' new 
 Let me find out that you fuckin' with Boo, and y'all gon' feel it 
 Waitin for the day that you front, and catch a lump 
 From my black butterfly, that don't pack a lullaby 
 Sleep on her, she said you bitches tried to creep on her 
 In the mall and didn't know she had the reach on her 
 Pearl-handled twenty-two, my Boo 
 She go ahead and walk her dogs, and represent Wu 
 To the fullest, you and hon can shoot the fair one 
 I'll bring the bullets, know that I'm sayin'? Stop playin' 
 You and them dyke lookin' bitches 
 Actin' like y'all jumpin' somethin', go 'head with that bullshit

 I'm still in love with babe (8X) 
 (Method Man) 
 Got tired of the games, the lies, the feeble alibis 
 Now you fuckin' with the next guy, a Thug Nigga 
 Derelict be actin' bugged nigga, show this nigga 
 Mad love but get no love nigga?? Stupid ass 
 Plus I heard that he be beatin' on you, I seen him 
 At the club cheatin' on you, witcha best friend, got you stressin 
 And used up, pull your shoes up, all you need's affection 
 But you're headed in the wrong direction 
 Tryin' to make this nigga jealous, with other fellas 
 All up in my face actin' overzealous 
 Like you want somethin' from Meth, I hope it ain't love girl 
 'Cause I ain't got none left for you, plus you miserable 
 Misery Love Company, shit I'm livin' comfortably, don't need no 
 Nigga huntin me down for fuckin' round, with his kitty 
 Talk to him, before my brother put a spark through him 
 Won't be pretty, the situation got my whole attitude shitty 
 And got you actin' high saditty with your slut committee 
 You know I know; so go find another sucker yo, I been there 
 And been done that befo', and don't need it no mo' 
 That's, my, word! So go to your own with that there, word up 
 And tell that bighead nigga you run with that you was insane
