I've gotta tell you, tell you about it 
 I've been gone for so long 
 I just wanna sing my song 
 I know you been hearin 
 Hearin a lot of things about me 
 Oh I know, I know 
 I've heard, I have heard it all to clear 
 This is what I am going to do 
 I am goin' to hold, hold on to my pride 
 I'm gonna stick, I'm gonna stick to my guns 
 I'm gonna put my finger on the trigger 
 I'm gonna pull it and we gon see what the deal 
 I'm for real, I just wanna put it, put it on the line 
 I've gotta put it on the line 
 And we havent got much time 
 I've gotta put it on the line 
 Know what I'm talking bout this evening 
 I've gotta put it on the line 
 I've got a bullet in the chamber 
 And I'm not afraid of the danger 
 We've gotta go down to the wire 
 I'll go through the fire with you 
 Kill and die with you 
 I know everybody watchin me 
 The pressure is on 
 From every angle 
 Political 2 personal 
 Will I hang or b left hangin' will I fall off? 
 Or will it be bangin'? 
 I say its up to the man upstairs 
 I am goin' to hold, hold on to my pride 
 I'm gonna stick, I'm gonna stick to my guns 
 I'm gonna put my finger on the trigger 
 I'm gonna pull it and we gon see what the deal 
 I'm for real, I just wanna put it, put it on the line 
 I've gotta put it on the line 
 And we havent got much time 
 I've gotta put it on the line 
 Know what I'm talking bout this evening 
 I've gotta put it on the line
