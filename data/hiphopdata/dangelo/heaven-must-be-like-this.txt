You know what I think heaven is 
 I think heaven is you 
 You know that a place where I can find happiness 
 A place close to your loveliness 
 Somewhere to rest my aching mind 
 Where there's no time your love just divined 
 Heaven must be like this 
 It must be like this 
 Heaven must be like this 
 It must be like this 
 The sweet in sour taste of love 
 We just made a good place in the shade 
 A glass of lemonade, al, al 
 Don't be afraid just love 
 Heaven must be 
 Heaven must be like this 
 Heaven must be like this 
 Heaven must be like this 
 It must be like this 
 Wrap your love around me 
 Listen girl there's no place like you 
 You're all the places 
 A place where I can find happiness 
 A place close to your loveliness 
 Somewhere to rest my aching mind 
 Where there is no time 
 Heaven must be like this 
 It must be like this
