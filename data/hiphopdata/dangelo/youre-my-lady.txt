You're my lady 
 You're my lady 
 You're my lady 
 You're my lady 
 Don't think I don't see them lookin' at ya 
 All of them wishin' they could have ya 
 And as a matter of fact, uh 
 A bunch of them are itchin' for you to scratch 'em 
 I'm tired of hidin' what we feel 
 I'm tryin' to get with the real 
 And I'm-a gonna make it know 
 'Cause I want them to know 
 You're my lady 
 You're my lady 
 You're my lady 
 You're my lady 
 You're my little baby, my darling baby 
 I swear you're the talk of the town 
 And everybody wants to know 
 What's going down 
 Babe, I know they've seen us before 
 Maybe at the liquor store 
 Or maybe at the health food stand 
 They don't know that I'm your man 
 You're my lady 
 You're my lady 
 You're my lady 
 You're my lady 
 I can tell they're lookin' at us 
 I pick you up everyday from your job 
 And every guy in the parking lot 
 Wants to rob me of my girl and my heart and soul 
 And everybody wants to treat me so cold 
 But I know I love you and you love me 
 There's no other lover for you or me 
 You're my lady 
 You're my lady 
 My divine lady 
 You're my lady 
 Such a wonderful lady 
 I can't tell they're looking at us 
 You're my lady 
 My divine lady 
 You're my lady 
 Such a wonderful lady 
 I can't tell they're looking at us 
 You're my lady 
 My divine lady 
 You're my lady 
 Such a wonderful lady 
 I can't tell they're looking at us
