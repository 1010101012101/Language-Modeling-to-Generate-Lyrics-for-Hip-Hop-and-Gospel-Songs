When we get by, we'll make it by, when we get by with love 
 I look in your eyes, when I look in your eyes 
 I know what your thinking of 
 T'is a beautiful day, and you're welcome to stay 
 We can spend some time and catch the matinee 
 You're so fine, and the day is fine, and we'll be fine 
 When we make it by and we get by with love 
 When we get by, we'll make it by, when we get by with love 
 When we get by, we'll make it by, when we get by with love 
 I look in your eyes, I look in your eyes 
 They're pretty as the skies above 
 Everything, everything, everything is okay 
 We could make love in the shade, sip some chocolate lemonade 
 You're so fine, and the day is fine, and we'll be fine 
 When we get by and we make it by with love 
 When we get by, we'll make it by, when we get by with love 
 I look in your eyes, I look in your eyes 
 I know what you're thinking of 
 'Cause it's a beautiful day 
 And you know that's a fact 
 You scratch mine 
 And I'll scratch your back sugar 
 You're so fine 
 And today's fine 
 When we make it by 
 And we get by with love
