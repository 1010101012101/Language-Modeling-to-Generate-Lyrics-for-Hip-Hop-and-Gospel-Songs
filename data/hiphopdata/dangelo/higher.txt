1st Verse 
 Feels like heaven when I think about you 
 Sparking that love within my soul 
 And when I touch U, I can't describe it 
 Send chills, down my bonz 
 1st Bridge 
 Wit God as my witness and watching over 
 We'll write our love in the stone 
 Please give us strength Lord to fight our battles 
 And we can walk on the streets of gold 
 Cause you take me higher, than I've ever, ever know 
 Give me good feeling, like a king and queen on a throne 
 Cause you take me higher, further than the sky above 
 Send me in ecstasy baby, with you love 
 2nd verse 
 Tell me what you're thinking of, must thinking of love 
 Put your hands into mine and then we'll take off to the sky above 
 Soft like an angel, like the feathers laying on a dove 
 Touch me with your soul love, till I lose control 
 2nd Bridge 
 Just like an angel watching over me 
 (U protect me from my fears) 
 I once was blind, but now I see 
 (Ever since the day you appeared) 
 I just wanna say 
 I want you in my life 
 Till the day I die baby 
 Look in my eyes, 
 Tell me right now, 
 That you and your love 
 Will 4-ever take me higher 
 Repeat 1st Bridge
