Whenever I feel like giving up 
 Whenever my sunshine turns to rain 
 Whenever my hopes and dreams 
 Are aimed in the wrong direction 
 She's always there telling me how much she cares 
 She's always in my hair 
 She's always in my hair, my hair 
 Whenever I feel like not too great at all 
 Whenever I'm all alone 
 And even if I hit the wrong notes 
 She's always in my boat 
 She's always there telling me how much she cares 
 She's always in my hair 
 She's always in my hair, my hair 
 Maybe I'll marry her, maybe I won't 
 Maybe I will not, let me tell you, baby 
 If I was a gigolo all my life 
 She'd still be there telling me 
 Just how much she really cares 
 She's always in my hair 
 She's always in my hair, my hair 
 Listen, whenever I feel like giving up 
 Whenever my sunshine turns to rain 
 Whenever my hopes and dreams 
 Are aimed in the wrong direction 
 She's always there telling me 
 Just how much she cares 
 Tell me, baby, always in my hair 
 She's always in my hair, my hair 
 She's always in my hair 
 She's always in my hair 
 She's always in my hair, my hair 
 She's always in my hair 
 She's always in my hair 
 She's always in my hair, my hair 
 She's always in my hair 
 She's always in my hair 
 She's always in my hair, my hair 
 She's always in my hair 
 She's always in my hair 
 She's always in my hair, my hair 
 Maybe I'll marry her, maybe I will not 
 Let me tell you, if I was a gigolo all my life 
 She'd still be there because she knows 
 She thinks I'm hot, that woman thinks I'm hot 
 What she knows, yeah 
 I feel like giving up, I feel like giving up 
 My sunshine turns to rain, yeah 
 My hope, my dream, drift in wrong direction 
 She's always, she's always in my hair 
 Woman, she's in my hair 
 My hair, that woman, she's in my hair 
 That woman, she's in my hair 
 My hair, my hair 
 She's in my hair
