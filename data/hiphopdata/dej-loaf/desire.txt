I don't ask no questions 
 I just handle business 
 I don't ask no favors 
 I don't ask for niggas 
 Who the fuck asked you niggas? 
 Look, I don't run from no one 
 Pass me my drink, I'm on one 
 Real killers moving in silence, 
 Ask Oba, Ask Oba 
 All of these niggas be goofy rats 
 Tell'em known everything moving 
 I was in lost and I was feeling real groovy 
 Shoutout my boy Trae he put on for Houston 
 I say, "who want it with me?" 
 Pull up with Benz, got them drummers with me 
 Ready for war like, who coming with me? 
 Got goons who feel like what's the point in living 
 Niggas hoes, so what's the point in trippin' 
 Crack a nigga head like a fortune cookie 
 Like a choice pussy, wet you all with like 
 Like moist pussy 
 My young niggas look autumn 
 Get a hand going for a buck fifty 
 No thanksgiving, I ate dinner 
 I ain't missing out on no meals 
 I'm so patient, I'll wait for it 
 Cut a nigga face like seals 
 I'm so trill, I'm so 'bout it 
 My music give me chills, ah 
 Like damn I'm so little but 
 I'm feeling like Shaquille (O'neal) 
 If I go today, just know today 
 You were in my will (my fam) 
 My best friend and my godson 
 He just like my kid (Tristin) 
 I ain't going back to my old life 
 I'm in this shit forreal (I'm in it, I'm winnin') 
 So if you try to take that from me nigga 
 It's kill or be killed, ah (wassup?) 
 It's kill or be killed 
 I can't hold back I gotta live life 
 Go and get everything that I desire 
 Why you playin' with stones? 
 If you don't like fire 
 What's the point of playin' rolls 
 If you ain't gon' own the title 
 I can't hold back I gotta live life 
 Go and get everything that I desire 
 Why you playin' with stones? 
 If you don't like fire 
 What's the point of playin' rolls 
 If you ain't gon' own the title 
 I can't hold back I gotta live life 
 Go and get everything that I desire 
 Why you playin' with stones? 
 If you don't like fire 
 What's the point of playin' rolls 
 If you ain't gon' own the title 
 Nigga's intension be bad 
 Look at what they did to demire 
 Look at what they did to my dad 
 Niggas be feelin' themselves 
 I rather feel on myself 
 Than to let you feel on my ass 
 I got the chrome and the stash 
 I'm not no thug, I just know niggas with mask 
 Whoa, hahaaa 
 You pussies don't move how I move 
 I ain't into flashing my jewels 
 I ain't never gon' lose 
 Can't be like Tim with that two 
 We got burners and fuel (fuel) 
 We'll do you, we'll do you, we'll do you 
 Whoa, hahaaa 
 We'll do you, aye, we'll do you 
 I can't hold back I gotta live life 
 Go and get everything that I desire 
 Why you playin' with stones? 
 If you don't like fire 
 What's the point of playin' rolls 
 If you ain't gon' own the title 
 I can't hold back I gotta live life 
 Go and get everything that I desire 
 Why you playin' with stones? 
 If you don't like fire 
 What's the point of playin' rolls 
 If you ain't gon' own the title 
 I can't hold back I gotta live life 
 Go and get everything that I desire 
 Why you playin' with stones? 
 If you don't like fire 
 What's the point of playin' rolls 
 If you ain't gon' own the title
