You left me time 
 Oh, oh 
 This from me to you 
 Oh, oh 
 Look 
 I really think that you're hot 
 Let me see what you got, (let me see it, let me see it) 
 How could we make this make sense? (how? how?) 
 Without looking really crazy 
 (I ain't trying to look like no fool, you know) 
 You got a family of your own 
 And you know my situation 
 I wouldn't say it if I ain't mean it, (Wouldn't say, wouldn't say) 
 Baby, you're so beautiful to me, (you're so beautiful to me) 
 And I wonder what it's like, (I wonder, I wonder) 
 I want to take a risk and see 
 And I think you feel the same 
 How you be staring at me, (How you be staring at me) 
 (I always catch you looking at me every time, I saw you) 
 I make love to you all in my head 
 Why does this feel like some love affair? 
 I know what I want when I see it 
 So I'm a go, but what I know so be it 
 I ain't trynna cause no drama 
 But I can't help how I feel 
 Butterflies in my stomach 
 Every time that I see you 
 Oh, oh 
 Oh, oh 
 Every time that I see you 
 Meet me in the lobby (Can you meet me downstairs in the lobby, I knock on your door) 
 In your gym clothes 
 So nobody knows 
 I said can't nobody stop us (Can't nobody stop us) 
 Not, I stand my ground ten toes, (Ten toes, I hold it down for you) 
 The way you make me feel 
 Do that thing with your nose, okay, (Why you keep doing that?) 
 Baby, look I can show you better than 
 I can tell you, I want you, I want you, want you 
 And I'm a get you, naw 
 I ain't trynna cause no drama 
 But I can't help how I feel 
 Butterflies in my stomach 
 Every time that I see you 
 Oh, oh 
 Oh, oh 
 Every time that I see you
