Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah 
 Every time you hurt me I don't know 
 Why I can't throw your clothes out the window 
 Every time I try to be strong and let you go 
 You start talking sweet to me like I was you ho 
 Tell me baby what you want with me, doing this to just embarrass me 
 Tell me who think you pimping boy when I'm the only one who brings you joy 
 And I'm the one who keeps you stash, never make you spend the money you flash 
 Never ask you for a fucking thing, and you gave that bitch my diamond ring 
 I don't know why I try, to believe all your lies 
 Every time using me, why I act like you playing big deez 
 Why I still understand, you got more kids than you said you had man 
 Every time a new girl pops up, I guess I don't give enough 
 Every time you hurt me I don't know 
 Why I can't throw your clothes out the window 
 Every time I try to be strong and let you go 
 You start talking sweet to me like I was you ho 
 Tell me baby what you want from me, do you just want to embarrass me 
 Tell me why I let you steal my 
 You don't know how bad it hurts me, when my niggaz laugh at me 
 I don't know what's keeping me but the sex ain't as good as it use to be so 
 I don't know why I still pay your bail and you deserve to be there 
 And every time that your're broke, I pay you money just to leave me alone 
 Why I don't understand that you ain't no kind of man 
 Giving me grabbing my clothes, I guess I don't get enough 
 Every time you hurt me I don't know 
 Why I can't throw your clothes out the window 
 Every time I try to be strong and let you go 
 You start talking sweet to me like I was your ho
