Hey, mister see the sister 
 Don't you let them feel you 
 Sticks and stones may break your bones 
 But now her looks could kill you 
 Hey, come away 
 Souca souca na na 
 Come on, come on, miss 
 Allez, allez, 
 With a souca souca mama 
 Oh, hey, come away 
 Souca souca na na 
 Come on, come on, miss 
 Allze, allez. 
 With a souca souca maman 
 On, hey, come away 
 Souca souca na na

 Allze, allze 
 With a souca souca mama 
 Come on, come on miss, 
 Allze, allze 
 With a souca souca mama.
