From the top..(6x) 
 Shut up..(8x) (I'm about to) 
 Wasn't that fun, let's try something else... 
 45 caliber killer without of the filla 
 Elevated Show your brothas how your not a gorilla 
 Smooth talkin' fully automatic weapon concealer 
 Taste thrilla, great filler 
 Hit him with the bounce stiller 
 Filthy stinking standing on the side grounded 
 Still be sinking submerging in the parks 
 Still be linking plucked beats when it starts 
 Hope your thinking it's not a mirage 
 I'm living up off tracks from out of the garage 
 Well if you could duck but its hard to dodge 
 In the back of that spine where my darkness lies 
 Flippin' straight up ripping apart your squad 
 X-Ecutioner's Style cuts and blends 
 Like a syringe banging you in each of your limbs 
 See me coming through your party hard 
 Without no body guard 
 Smoking something, stomping on each of your toes 
 I'm the B to the L to the A to the C King 
 (Uh huh..) 
 And when it comes to planning the Thought, keeping thinking this 
 Shut up..(8x)
