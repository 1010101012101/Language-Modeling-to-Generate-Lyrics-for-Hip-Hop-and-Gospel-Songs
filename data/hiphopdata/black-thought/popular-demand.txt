Pull a man (very an?) whip 
 Big bear brothers in it lookin' skinny as diss 
 Hop out the back in a patch clearly I'm lit 
 Look at the black prez 
 Holla then back to back shots an accent 
 I'm kind of a big deal 
 I can feel ecstasy without popping a pill 
 I'm on top of the world 
 In my old school copperfield 
 Got five o eights apocalypse style 
 It ain't no stopping us now 
 Just like they vannan white head 
 People say the phily boys having it right here 
 And there's no comparison the difference is quite clear 
 Plus we white bread 
 Brothers like americas nightmare 
 I need my own show like regis 
 To talk about the way there rappers is hegis 
 Get that money 
 Is blasphemy 
 Its as smart as a crash dummy, that's funny 
 Brothers are is a battle in last for me
