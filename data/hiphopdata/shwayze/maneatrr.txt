She on that full moon, night crawler, 
 Blood stain, on my collar. (uh, uh) 
 She's a maneater. (uh) 
 Nails scratchin' on my back, 
 No escapin' her attack. (uh, uh) 
 She's a maneater. (eater) 
 Like a stalker, with a knife, 
 Cold like vodka, on the ice. 
 Spike heels, neon lights, 
 Turn your back in that super side. 
 Maneater, she's a maneater. (damn) 
 I don't know if I ever make it out alive. 
 I was a fool to think that I'd be all right, tonight. 
 She's a maneater (ay) and I can't beat her. (oh) 
 'Cause I've had a few drinks and I can't see her. (ay oh) 
 I don't know if I ever make it out alive, tonight. (yeah, yeah) 
 She ain't all that lovey-dove, cuddle-bug, baby wanna cut me up. 
 She's a maneater. 
 She don't wanna talk it out, she's all about that chew me up and spit me out shit. 
 She's a maneater. (eater) 
 One more shot and I'm blackin' out, don't know what she talkin' 'bout. 
 Don't wanna wake up at her house, butt naked, ass out. 
 Damn, musta passed out, damn musta passed ou--- 
 I don't know if I ever make it out alive. 
 I was a fool to think that I'd be all right, tonight. 
 She's a maneater (ay) and I can't beat her. (oh) 
 'Cause I've had a few drinks and I can't see her. (ay oh) 
 I don't know if I ever make it out alive, tonight. (yeah, yeah) 
 She up in the club, like a DJ. 
 Scratchin' me up, instant replay. 
 Backin' me up, in the corner. 
 And I want her, but I know I'm gon' regret it in the mornin'.
