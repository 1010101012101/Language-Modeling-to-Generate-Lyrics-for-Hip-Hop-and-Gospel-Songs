Her name was Mary Jane, 
 She sang, like Etta James, 
 She came and went so easily. 
 And it's strange, how times are changed, 
 I seen Mary yesterday, and she, 
 Don't look the same to me. 
 Baby what's the word? 
 I ain't trying to kill your mockingbird. 
 I got scared and I started walking backwards. 
 And after I got home alone, 
 I couldn't stop drunk dialing your cellular phone. 
 And when you don't pick up, your hang up hurts. 
 I know I got caught with my hand up her skirt. 
 I'm into sandals with the candle light romance, 
 I go to iTunes, to download your slow jams. 
 Typhoon, with the Thunder clap. 
 I fell in love with the girl in my summer class. 
 She sat, right next to me, 
 And she made me tell the truth like ecstasy. 
 So, whoa, I gotta slow myself on down. 
 I've been in love before. 
 Baby will you be my mellow lil lady. 
 Marijuana sunshine soul made crazy. 
 Why go back and forth like a maybe? 
 You and I can flow and say I love sailing. 
 Light brown elleby on Chip and dale. 
 Skin say I'm fat but I'm skinny as a rail. 
 Pet snail, I got a freak on her knees. 
 I need a little more made of the American Dream. 
 I want her fired up, yeah baby don't try to tie me up. 
 I'm just not the type of guy that'd wanna lie to ya. 
 And if you wanna try to fall in love, 
 It's going to take a little time, 
 And I won't budge for a minute now. 
 You've got to slow yourself on down. 
 I've been in love before. 
 Well she arrived on an Astro plane. 
 6:45 on a Saturday. 
 Just in time for the masquerade, 
 Just in time for the masquerade. 
 Well she arrived in a limousine, 
 7:45 on a Sunday, 
 Just in time to see: 
 Me making love to her friend Marie. 
 I said: Baby this ain't what you think. 
 Like I'm supposed to say that 'cause I've seen it on TV 
 Then she ran out into the street. 
 Why this has happened to me? 
 No, got to slow myself on down. 
 I know where this is going now. 
 I've been in love before.
