I met her at a backyard block party by the bar 
 She kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was 
 She was buzzin' all over me 
 She was buzzin' all over me 
 She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love 
 Bang bang, baby shot me in the heart 
 In the dark with the dart, felt the spark when it hit 
 When we me at the spot it was hot 
 Like this song, saw the thong it was on 
 Now it's eight in the morning 
 I move on like the Greyhound bus 
 I go town to town and I prey on sluts 
 I got to go, so scream out your area code 
 I'm comin' all the way live from the 310 
 I got a whole lotta love but none like you 
 You make me wanna stay here in Heaven with you 
 I write your name in the sand, put your hand with mine 
 Come on baby, shoot your gun in the sky 
 I met her at a backyard block party by the bar 
 She kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was 
 She was buzzin' all over me 
 She was buzzin' all over me 
 She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love 
 Bang bang, baby hit me one time 
 Two days on the road and you still on my mind 
 You think that I would learn 'cause I'm young and fine 
 But I'm broke so I'm tryin' to make a hustle outta rhyme 
 I gotta see the world one girl at a time 
 But you're hangin' on my sleeve like I care that you're cryin' 
 And I do, I'm just tryin' to play it cool 
 I got a rep to protect, down at the high school 
 Why you try to cage me in 
 And when I leave we both know that you be pagin' him 
 And when I come back we goin' do it again. 
 I promise we goin' do it again. 
 I met her at a backyard block party by the bar (Do it again) 
 She kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was (Do it again) 
 She was buzzin' all over me 
 She was buzzin' all over me 
 She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love 
 Yeah, bang bang, I wanna give you my name 
 But I'm tryin' to put some diamonds in my Shwayze chain 
 Babies change, they start showin' them fangs 
 Trying to take a ride on this crazy train 
 Choo choo, what the hell am I to do? 
 I got a girl in every city from here to Peru 
 When I left you, I signed my name on your left boob 
 Now go get that tattooed, I'll be back soon 
 Don't cry, I'll bless you with a text soon 
 I gotta go, but I'll be back next June 
 Or July, sparks in the sky 
 She said, "Boy, you crazy," 
 Nah, I'm Shwayze 
 I met her at a backyard block party by the bar 
 She kept lookin' at me like she knew who I was 
 She was buzzin' all over me 
 She was buzzin' all over me 
 She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love 
 And I don't know what she was on 
 Whatever it was, I want some 
 She was buzzin' all over me 
 She was buzzin' all over me 
 She was buzzin' all over me like she fell in love
