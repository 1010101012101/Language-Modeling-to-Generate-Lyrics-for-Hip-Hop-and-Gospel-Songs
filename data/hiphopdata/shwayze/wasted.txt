Let's go out for a drink and forget 
 All the things that we said that we know we'll regret 
 I said 
 Let's go out for a drink and forget all the things that we 
 Did when we were wasted 
 Baby, let's forget the bad times 
 Talk about the good times 
 Wonder where they went 
 Wonder where they went 
 Last night we got into a fight 
 I said some things I wouldn't say to you in daylight 
 Woke up and you were gone 
 Left the radio playing our favorite song 
 On repeat (on repeat) 
 Plus you took one of each of my sneaks 
 Left a note that said "we can't be" 
 'Cause I caught you this and I caught you that 
 6 missed calls 
 Call me back 
 But you called your dad 
 Told him he was right about all of that 
 Said I'm no good 
 Going nowhere fast 
 Mad 'cause I spent my days smokin' hash 
 Writin' raps over kicks and claps 
 Someday we can all kick back 
 And I'm waiting for the phone to ring 
 So we can go out and have a drink 
 Let's go out for a drink and forget 
 All the things that we said that we know we'll regret 
 I said 
 Let's go out for a drink and forget all the things that we 
 Did when we were wasted 
 (We were wasted) 
 (Go out and have a drink) 
 Baby, let's forget the bad times 
 Talk about the good times 
 Wonder where they went 
 (I wonder where they went) 
 Baby, we can play the back nine 
 Talk about the good times 
 Wonder where they went 
 Wonder where they went 
 Let's take a second to recollect 
 A time when the sex was as good as it gets 
 A time when a song 'bout love was a hit 
 Spent all summer falling in love 
 Summer time trippin' 
 And tongue twisting 
 I said I'd blow up 
 But you didn't want to listen 
 I gotta bounce 
 I'm on a mission 
 Tears in your eyes as we good-bye kissing (good-bye kissing) 
 Let's go out for a drink and forget 
 All the things that we said that we know we'll regret (go out and have a drink) 
 I said 
 Let's go out for a drink and forget all the things that we 
 Did when we were wasted 
 (Go out and have a drink) 
 Go 'head, baby 
 I said to my lady 
 She shakes that thing 'cause she knows that's what makes me 
 Happy 
 And when I'm napping 
 She goes into my jeans 
 And steals my cash (steals my cash) 
 I used to be that dude with the elbow ash 
 Take a hit from your stash 
 Well, I came up fast 
 My treat, reminisce over a glass 
 I'll meet you at the bar 
 Let's say say quarter past (quarter past) 
 Let's go out for a drink and forget 
 All the things that we said that we know we'll regret (a quarter past) 
 I said 
 Let's go out for a drink and forget all the things that we 
 Did when we were wasted 
 (Go out and have a drink) 
 Let's go out for a drink and forget 
 All the things that we said that we know we'll regret (go out and have a drink) 
 I said 
 Let's go out for a drink and forget all the things that we 
 Did when we were wasted (go out and have a drink)
