I know a place where the hearts don't break 
 The reality is scripted and the boobs are fake 
 The smell of success is sold like inscents 
 And pump through the vents of your mercedes-benz 
 And all my friends are almost famous 
 Making sex tapes to get on the a-list 
 Trynna get their faces on the tabloid pages 
 So they can get paid to party in vegas 
 And rehab and then its off to rehab and a 22 million dollar malibu beach pad 
 I seen that the ways these girls on the scene that 
 When they first show up 
 Trynna blow up you know what these little girls better grow up 
 Before they sniff and spend all their dough up 
 O.D. choke on they throw up 
 In the hotel California 
 I know a little place we can go right down the road 
 The lights are always on 
 The bar is never closed 
 I know a little place we can go right down the road 
 But nothing good is free 
 It'll cost you your heart and your soul 
 I know a place on the sunset strip 
 Where all the beautiful ladies like to undress quick 
 And if you gotta nice whip 
 And come pick up the check 
 You can get your dick wet by a young rocket 
 Sex money and fame in los angeles 
 It's a place where a pretty face get you access 
 To the access of the young and the reckless 
 Another scratch on the bumper of my lexus 
 New kid in town is the next big thing 
 And she sing like a bird if your pitch corrected 
 Little pop star headed for the top now 
 In the fast lane with the top down 
 Too late for the brakes can't stop now 
 Wild child call for your mom now 
 Screamin' out there's no place like home 
 And then she spend another night alone 
 I know a little place we can go right down the road 
 The lights are always on 
 The bar is never closed 
 I know a little place we can go right down the road 
 But nothing good is free 
 It'll cost you your heart and your soul 
 Its ashame how the money and fame 
 Gotta pretty young thang goin' out with a bang 
 Gettin' used up so beat and bruised up 
 The same ol' shit come later come sooner 
 Nothin' new just a different case 
 She dissappeared in a year no sign no trace 
 Got caught up in the pace leather and lace 
 Got addicted after just one taste 
 She made an entrance lit up the place 
 With a thousand flashes goin' off in her face 
 She couldn't take it the fame stripped her naked 
 Taken over by the need to make it 
 Sleepin' with the agents to get a start 
 Sleepin' with directors to get the part 
 Sleepin' pills and alcohol 
 I seen it all in the valley of the dogs 
 I know a little place we can go right down the road 
 The lights are always on 
 The bar is never closed 
 I know a little place we can go right down the road 
 But nothing good is free 
 It'll cost you your heart and your soul
