 When the sun comes up 
 I leave my booty in the bed 
 Baby said shwayze, don't leave just yet 
 Heres sum weed, n the keys to my man's corvet 
 (I need sum sex, baby please say yes) 
 Well needless to say, I stayed for a sec 
 Got my dick wet, and bounced wit the vet 
 This is a stick up. Put ur hands up 
 Male gigalo, Man slut

 Rode into town, when the sun went down 
 Found a pretty little lady who I wanna lay down with 
 Holdin' it down with the brand new sound 
 And your speakers in the jeep keep pounding 
 ...Little dove, I'm pathetic with love 
 And I cut you so deep, no anastetic... you numb 
 And when I leave your broken heart, 
 Where stuck together with gum 
 And... I... know... its... kinda... meann but

 (1234) Are we gonna make love or we gonna fight. (were musicans) 
 I don't wanna know your name (were musicans) 
 But il sing you a song... if you like (were musicans)
