With my raincoat on 
 It's all right baby hold my hand 
 I ain't tryin' to be your man 
 Let's take it slow 
 Relax a little 
 Make it so it's naturable 
 As a matter of fact 
 Let's take it black 
 To the very first day I had your back 
 We shared a cab 
 Shared a laugh 
 Shared a glass 
 And I kissed yo ass 
 Kissed yo lips after class 
 We both had history after math 
 Passin' notes, teachers askin' for 'em 
 I read 'em out loud to the class 
 Like a poem or a rap 
 Say it liked I mean it 
 When my big toe tap 
 Hand them back and forth like that 
 If you like what your hearin' 
 You can meet me out back (out back) 
 With my raincoat on 
 In the heart of the sun 
 With my raincoat on 
 In the heart of the city 
 I la-la-lost my mind 
 I la-la-lost my lady 
 I la-la-lost my mind 
 But I la-la-love you baby 
 It crossed my mind 
 But I lost my mind 
 I guess I should check back in sometime 
 Sometimes a perfect litte word rhymes 
 And sometimes it don't 
 Fine, rewind 
 Repeat it three times if you mean it 
 I wanna crib by the beach, believe it 
 So baby doll, I'm leavin' 
 Baby doll, I'm leavin' 
 Duffle bag filled with clothes 
 Notebook filled with flows 
 Phonebook filled with hoes 
 My dope hook gonna get me close 
 My hope is what drives me towards this future 
 Like a midnight double feature 
 So I high that I blow those tweeters 
 In the speakers 
 With my raincoat on 
 In the heart of the sun 
 With my raincoat on 
 In the heart of the city 
 I la-la-lost my mind (She' out the door) 
 I la-la-lost my lady (She' out the door) 
 I la-la-lost my mind (She' out the door) 
 But I la-la-love you baby (She' out the door) 
 Woke up at about noon 
 Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon 
 To get my hair lined up 
 And a new tattoo 
 The blacker the berry 
 The sweeter the juice 
 The mac of the year 
 Shwayzes a fool 
 Take you to school 
 And pick you up too 
 Maybe I'd do anything for you 
 Maybe I'd do anything for you 
 Maybe I'd do anything for you 
 Maybe I'd do anything for you 
 Would you do it for me? 
 I la-la-lost my mind (She' out the door) 
 I la-la-lost my lady (She' out the door) 
 I la-la-lost my mind (She' out the door) 
 But I la-la-love you baby (She' out the door) 
 I la-la-lost my mind (Yo man, you know life's good right now) 
 I la-la-lost my lady (I'm next to the beach, my feet in the sand) 
 I la-la-lost my mind (And you gone and I'm happy, whatever baby) 
 But I la-la-love you baby 
 I la-la-lost my mind 
 I la-la-lost my lady 
 I la-la-lost my mind 
 But I la-la-love you baby
