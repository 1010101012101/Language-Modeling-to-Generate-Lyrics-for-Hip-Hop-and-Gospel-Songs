(Sample: Elvis - Long Black Limo) 
 There's a long line of mourners 
 Driving down our little street 
 Their fancy cars are such a sight to see, oh yeah 
 They're all your rich friends who knew you in the city 
 And now they've finally brought you 
 Brought you home to me 
 Fancy Cars 
 Yeah uh yeah 
 A fancy car ain't what I need 
 I need a girl in some skinny jeans 
 An oversized tshirt that reads "whatever happened to American dreams" 
 Shwayze- 
 Headphones bumpin fly beats 
 The card in my wallet says I can buy weed 
 Strike a pose like I know thai chi 
 The high life treats me nicely 
 California love long island iced tea 
 The girls in the city are a bit pricey 
 What up to my ladies out in jersey 
 And my dirty girls in duke university 
 Most certainly I've been lucky 
 Fell in love two times in kentucky 
 And dressed up like rick james in london 
 Nicknamed my chick champagne 'cause she's bubbly 
 Lovely pretty bumblebee suckle honey 
 Peanut butter dreams with the strawberry jelly 
 (Fancy cars) drivin' down my street 
 (Fancy cars) ain't shit to me 
 (Fancy cars) ain't what I need x2 
 Cisco- 
 Yeah she was the apple of my eye 
 The cherry in my pie 
 My little crab cake loved to cry 
 She said she's gonna move out to NY 
 I said why she said to get fly 
 I said ok babe do your thing 
 I'll be right here when you're back again 
 She said she comin' back in a limousine 
 I said pick me up on the scene 
 When you drive through in your escalade 
 Like the president on election day 
 Say hey, peanut butter dreams and strawberry jelly 
 x3 
 Come on lets go 
 I got places to be I got people to meet I got things to see 
 I got thing do I got things to do I got things to do 
 (I gotta go baby) and if you want I'll do them with you 
 (I mean you could come if you want) but you gotta promise that you'll be true (be true no lies) 
 Oh yeah oh yeah (get on the freeway man and uh we just keep on goin' because it's me and you and you my rich girl) 
 Fade out
