Summertime girl, you're my summertime girl 
 Summertime girl, you're my summertime girl 
 Summertime girl, you're my summertime girl 
 Ill do anything that you want me to 
 Chillin' in school, back of the class 
 Acting a fool, tryna make you laugh 
 I had a question and I was waiting to ask 
 But the bell rang and you was gone in a flash 
 Three weeks later I was sitting on the beach 
 Sipping on a brew, you were looking at me 
 I gave you a smile, you threw me a wink 
 Took a sip of my drink, you were gone in the blink of an eye 
 Next time, Imma think of a line 
 To tell you how I feel inside 
 Cause baby girl, you're always on my mind 
 Baby girl, you're always on my mind 
 Looking at your flicks online 
 Following your tweets 
 Waiting for a not reply 
 Cause its summertime 
 And you can't spell that without you and I 
 Hold on baby, don't go nowhere 
 Just stay put, I need you there 
 I got something that I wanna share 
 I got something that I wanna share 
 With you, its true 
 Ill do anything that you want me to 
 Summertime girl, you're my summertime girl 
 Summertime girl, you're my summertime girl 
 Summertime girl, you're my summertime girl 
 Ill do anything that you want me to 
 When it's the middle of the day in the middle of May 
 You know summertimes just a minute away 
 I'm like F that!, I ain't getting an A 
 So I skipped class and head to the bay 
 Sunshine, sea spray, Buzzin on replay 
 It's so hard, that's what she say 
 Little Miss Sunshine, no tan line 
 Laying on her belly and I'm looking at her behind 
 Wondering if maybe shell be my summer chick 
 And I can be a Big Mac lovin' it 
 Cause baby girl, you're always on my mind 
 Baby girl, you're always on my mind 
 Looking at your flicks online 
 Following your tweets 
 Waiting for a not reply 
 Cause its summertime 
 And you can't spell that without you and I 
 Hold on baby, don't go nowhere

 Come here, love is free 
 From California out to NYC

 I got a summertime girl in Texas, baby 
 She's hot as hell and the sex is crazy 
 Craz-craz-craz-craz-craz-crazy

 Hold on baby, don't go nowhere 
 Just stay put, I need you there
