 Just to watch you leave 
 I don't wanna wait all night x3 
 Just to watch you leave 
 Fire alarm goin' off in the basement. 
 And I don't know how long I can take it. 
 You're on my mind and I can't erase it 
 When I close my eyes, I see you naked 
 You impressed just a little bit, ain'tcha? 
 You can give me just a little kiss, Cain'tcha? 
 Tell your boyfriend you're puttin' on makeup 
 And meet me in the bathroom five minutes later 
 I don't wanna wait all night x3 
 Just to watch you leave 
 I don't wanna wait all night x3 
 Just to watch you leave 
 You the lock, I'm the key 
 You the kick, I'm the snare, let's make a beat 
 Nothin' in this world is free, except love 
 And the air we breathe 
 Do you wanna dance with me? 
 And see where it goes from there mon cheri 
 Mon cheri, we can see where it goes from there mon cheri 
 I don't wanna wait all night x3 
 Just to watch you leave

 All in the head of Tabi Bonney
