Some say when it rains it pours 
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore 
 And it ain't no place for us 
 Some say when it rains it pours 
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore 
 And it ain't no place for us 
 Ay yo 
 What the hell am I rhyming for 
 Designer clothes and designer whores 
 Designer cars and designer doors 
 Designer kitchen with designer doors 
 Hell no, vagina dog 
 The other shit wore me like a monologue 
 Like the Beatles when they were bigger then Jesus 
 I'm genuis Bill Clinton with my speeches 
 Look you in the eye and lie 
 Believe it, I mean it 
 Girl, I'm leaving 
 I don't really know where I'm gonna go 
 But I got a backpack full of demos 
 I'm a player baby, I should run for mayor maybe 
 The way I'm politicking lately 
 The way I'm politicking ladies 
 The way I'm politicking ladies 
 Some say when it rains it pours 
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore 
 And it ain't no place for us 
 Some say when it rains it pours 
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore 
 And it ain't no place for us 
 I'm convinced that if I hop the fence 
 I can climb on in and get my fingerprints on your booty, Julie, 
 I know you wanna do me 
 Since I moved to Malibu from the hood like a movie 
 Peoples chant with my sneakers in the sand 
 Blowing up like an amp so they kicked me out the band 
 That's when I met my man strummin' on a six string drink in his hand talking to his ding-a-ling 
 Why's everybody always picking on me 
 Why's everybody always picking on me 
 Why's everybody always picking on me 
 Why's everybody still coming to my party 
 (Everybody coming to my party) 
 Some say when it rains it pours 
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore 
 And it ain't no place for us 
 Some say when it rains it pours 
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore 
 And it ain't no place for us 
 Everybody coming to my party 
 It starts today 
 We getting naughty by nine 
 So don't be late 
 There's gonna be a line 
 So be prepared to wait 
 Fine, fine, ladies first 
 And bring your iceskates 
 And bring your wings 
 We all getting high tonight 
 And touching things 
 Muffin butt blowing cigarette rings 
 Everybody coming to my party 
 Everybody coming to my party 
 Everybody coming to my party 
 Everybody coming to my party 
 Some say when it rains it pours 
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore 
 And it ain't no place for us 
 Some say when it rains it pours 
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore 
 And it ain't no place for us
