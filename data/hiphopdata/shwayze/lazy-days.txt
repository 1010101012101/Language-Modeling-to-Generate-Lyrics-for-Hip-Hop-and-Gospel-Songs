Lazy days in Los Angeles 
 If it ain't your parents, it's the damn police 
 We just want to get our kicks for free

 Well, I was walkin' through Macarthur Park 
 Looking for some sugar just to cure my heart 
 And after dark I talk to the cabby 
 'Cause he drives me home if I call him daddy 
 And it's alright 
 Just as long as I can get high 
 Sit back and watch the sunset in the sky 
 I don't know if you know what I mean 
 But it's love in Los Angeles

 Gotta find a fine young little girl to screw ...over
