Yeah, Yeah 
 Yeah 
 I don't miss you 
 I'm a dismiss you 
 I'm a kiss you, next time I see you 
 It's true 
 Give all your lovin', give all your war 
 I don't need much of that 
 No, no, I'm a be all right, I'm a be all right 
 Seventeen, hero beauty queen introduced to me 
 She in the Hollywood scene 
 Moved to Cali from NYC 
 It's been eight months and she ain't happy 
 A couple shots of Patron, she eased the pain 
 Chased it with some Jack just to smile again 
 The everyday routine 
 Of a broken teen who left her heart close to where she left her dreams 
 Hidden tucked away so far now they missing 
 I took her hand and said baby listen 
 For every moment you waste, there's another right behind it to take it's place 
 Cause life goes on when it ain't so sweet 
 Don't give up on it 
 Get back on your feet 
 You can take another breath you gon' be okay 
 Just smile, forget yesterday 
 Give all your lovin', give all your war 
 I don't need much of that 
 No no, I'm a be all right, I'm a be all right 
 Cause all I need is a bag of weed 
 And lazy susan, so I can watch my TV 
 In the mall is where I met her 
 Wearing a brown sweater 
 She said she had a man 
 But I said I could do it better 
 My name is Shwayze, she responded with I'm Loretta 
 What a beautiful name, she said what beautiful game 
 One conversation lead to another 
 Was under some drinks, now we fucking each other 
 Constant sex turn to constant text 
 Saying how much she missed me 
 Wishing she could be with me 
 Damn, I made her cheat on her man 
 What makes me think she won't be cheating again 
 I just said never mind, yeah I miss you too 
 Give me a sec and I roll on through 
 Days turn to week, now holding hands and kissing cheeks 
 Using nicknames, spittin' game is obsolete 
 Damn, don't do to me what you did before 
 I just kept my mouth shut and we fucked some more (Yeah) 
 Give all your lovin', give all your war 
 I don't need much of that 
 No no, I'm a be all right, I'm a be all right 
 Cause all I need is a bag of weed 
 And lazy susan lying right here next to me 
 I've given too many chances two exotic dancers 
 Asking too many questions and receiving no answers 
 Investing my finances on pills for enhancement 
 Even got some facial cream so they could think I was handsome 
 Now, tell me that ain't insecurrrre 
 Yeah, you're right Kanye but how am I gonna fuck her? 
 It seems nowadays that's our only motive 
 And we're going to the first date without a trojan 
 Give all your lovin', give all your war 
 I don't need much of that 
 No no, I'm a be all right, I'm a be all right 
 Cause all I need is a bag of weed 
 Lazy susan, so I can watch my TV 
 Lazy susan lying right here next to me
