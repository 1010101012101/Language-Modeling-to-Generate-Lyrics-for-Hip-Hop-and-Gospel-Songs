I hate to be asked what does this mean 
 I... I realize that I amlnost have to apologize 
 To ask someone who's considered an artist such as you are 
 What they mean by something 
 Because your asking them to reinterperate something 
 That theyve already done 
 Do you think music has a meaning? 
 What I'm searching for, to tell it straight I'm gonna build a wall 
 Walkin' by myself, down avenue's ------------ 
 Ay, I rock the flow 
 ------- 
 Crackhear sam, say I'm dope, damn 
 Who got the smoke? 
 Panoramic vision in the hotel, yo 
 Yellow submarine float booty shake, whoa 
 Honey baked ham, let it marinate slow 
 ------- Like teradactyl 
 Guns and roses, grease the axel 
 Oh shit! shwayze got the hoes 
 More x's and o's than tic tac toe 
 Go get it 
 Ill take her to the show 
 It its sold out, that's the way it goes 
 Yo yo yo 
 What what what what I'm searching for, to tell it straight I'm gonna build a wall 
 Walkin' by myself down avenues ----- 
 Rock the flow 
 Yo 
 Barack is dope, ran got the vote 
 Old man Joe, drop the flow, damn 
 Shits rock as roll 
 Traffic in l.a. is stop and go 
 On at 10 and its 4 or 5 
 Gettin' head, is there more to life? 
 Hollywood is sorta like, highschool 
 Till ya 45 
 Ain't got a shawty, ain't got a wife 
 Don't want a girlfriend but we can fuck tonight 
 She said good luck tonight 
 I walked on stage and they hit the lights 
 1, 2, check the mike's 
 Is it on? 
 Can you hear me all right? 
 Uh, hello? 
 What I'm searching for... chorus. 
 What what what what what 
 Ayo this is the rich girls mixtape 
 My name is shwayze 
 Know what I'm sayin' my boy cisco on the beat 
 And I'm, bumpin
