If you got the weed 
 I got the pipe 
 We can get high together 
 All night 
 If you got the weed 
 I got the light 
 We can get high together 
 All night 
 It's 9:45 work start at 10 
 So it looks like I'm callin' 
 In sick again 
 I'd rather get some herb 
 And kick it with my friends 
 Hit the beach and treat it like 
 A weekend 
 Me and Jenn 
 Ain't really speakin' 
 So baby girl come over 
 This instant 
 Got a new ride 
 So fuck the speed limit 
 I live by the 'W's 
 Weed and women 
 I live on the beach 
 Down the street from cheech 
 I can't buy you a drink 
 And it's not that I'm cheap 
 I'm just broke ma 
 To let you know 
 But some how 
 I always got some weed to smoke 
 And if I don't 
 I'll still get you high 
 With my love 
 Under the moon sky 
 21 years young 
 Got a limited time 
 'Cause we livin' to die 
 So I'm livin' it right 
 If you got the weed 
 I got the pipe 
 We can get high together 
 All night 
 If you got the weed 
 I got the light 
 We can get high together 
 All night 
 Yo on Saturday 
 Took her to a play 
 It was the matinee 
 I didn't even pay her 
 The daddy say 
 That he don't like my ways 
 Probably 'cause I hit it three times today 
 Dropped her off late 
 With a sticky face 
 So a kiss on the cheek 
 Is your mistake 
 Drivin' down PCH 
 With a smile on my face 
 And a blunt in my ash tray 
 A cute chick on my side 
 And her ass is great 
 Almost out of gas 
 So we hit the bank 
 I didn't pay so I told her thanks 
 When she lent me the card 
 And filled my tank 
 Yeah she in the scene 
 Yatta yatta 
 With evisu jeans 
 Sidekick in her purse 
 Alexander mcqueen 
 I got my tip t-shirt 
 And some brand new kicks 
 But you know they ain't clean 
 If you got the weed 
 I got the pipe 
 We can get high together 
 All night 
 If you got the weed 
 I got the light 
 We can get high together 
 All night 
 High together all night 
 If you got the weed 
 I got the pipe 
 We can get high together 
 All night 
 High together all night 
 If you got the weed 
 I got the light 
 We can get high together 
 All night 
 High together all night
