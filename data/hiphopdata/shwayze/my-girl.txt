My girlfriend, she's a 10 
 She's real tan and she hits the gym 
 She wears red lingerie to bed 
 Her daddy's rich and she gives great head 
 My girlfriend got a big ol' butt (Say what?) 
 Daisy Dukes with the seams ripped up (Uh huh) 
 Crazy dudes like to whistle at her 
 And she looks like a stripper for sure 
 She likes to shake it 
 Whether clothes or naked 
 She dress like a ho but she talk like a lady 
 But lately, she been acting kinda shady 
 Coming home late with her make-up looking crazy 
 Hair messed up, hickies on her neck 
 I think I see some pussy juice dripping down her leg 
 I grabbed her by the head, 
 You know what I said? 
 I said who you been ridin' in the hood Little Red? 
 Baby it's not what you think 
 A couple drinks led to some things 
 I'm not sure how to tell you this, 
 I'm a lesbian (Lesbian?) 
 My girlfriend, she's a 10 
 She's real tan and she hits the gym 
 She wears red lingerie to bed 
 Her daddy's rich and she gives great head 
 My girlfriend drives a Benz 
 She got a lotta pretty best friends 
 They all like to experiment 
 My girlfriend is a lesbian 
 Oh my my, oh hell yeah 
 Baby like to take off her party dress 
 And it don't stop there (Where) 
 I walked in on a double-sided dildo love affair 
 They were bumpin' chairs, dressed in leather 
 Breathin' heavy, and whippin' each other 
 They looked at me like their mama just caught 'em 
 'Cause Johnny Rotten put mah seed up in their Apple Bottom 
 But then it all got weird 
 The other chick had a beard 
 I got scared and ran out of there 
 Pole vaulted on my dick down the stairs 
 Tarzan met Jane one day 
 Then Jane met Janet and moved away 
 Left Tarzan with nobody. 
 Sad all day, so he played Sorry.

 My girlfriend is a lesbian 
 My girl is now her girl 
 Her girl is now her man 
 Say it in French 'Le Lesbian' 
 Say it again, 'Le Lesbian' 
 I like girls who like girls 
 As long as they like me 
 But my girl just like girls 
 And now her girl wants to fight me 
 Punched in the eye by a girl named Butch 
 Pushed me in a bush 
 Stole my kush! 
 Took me for a fool, took my girl too 
 Right hook, now I gotta move schools 
 Nice lookin' with the basketball shoes 
 Tied tight, every night is ladies night 
 Wild night when you're dating a dyke 
 Oh yeah, I guess you gotta do...
