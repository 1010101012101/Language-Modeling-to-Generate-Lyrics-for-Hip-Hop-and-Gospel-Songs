Yeah 
 Wait a minute 
 Operator, on the line. I need your help. I got a girl to find 
 I got her number but I ain't got a dime 
 And I really wanna tell her that its real this time 
 Yeah 
 Ill admit, I'm a generous degenerate 
 Got jokes like Degeneres, but this time its cereal 
 What if I told you I just wanted to hold you? 
 I'm not the old me, you're not the old you 
 People grow like they're supposed to 
 We should go be bicostal 
 Sleep under the stars 
 It's all undecided till you pick up my call 
 (Pick up my call, girl) 
 Please! 
 It's the middle of the night 
 And I call your phone 
 I lost mine so I dial zero and say 
 Collect, collect call 
 Collect, collect call 
 Will you accept my collect call? 
 Operator, on the line, I really think she's gonna pick up this time 
 (Sir, you have to stop. I said if you don't we have to call the cops) 
 I ain't stalking 
 And there's nothing wrong with two people talking but I'm out of tokens 
 Help me 
 I'm broke and lonely 
 Don't hang up on me 
 Sittin' here waching time move like a snail 
 'Cause it's the 3rd time in three years that I'm in jail 
 I'm callin you
