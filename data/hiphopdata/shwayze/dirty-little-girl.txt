Dirty little girl in a dirty little life 
 Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind 
 Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies 
 My dirty little girl 
 Sure cleans up nice 
 High fashion trash on the street 
 Studio apartment penthouse sweet 
 High class low life freak 
 But shit goes on like oh la de 
 Day and night she walk to the beat 
 No sleep baby gotta eat 
 Shake it like a tambourine 
 Let me taste it little tangerine 
 Some girls like movie stars 
 Some girls like cash and cars 
 Some girls like champagne 
 Some girls like caviar 
 Some girls like other things 
 Don't need no diamond rings 
 All me dirty girls sing 
 Dirty little girl in a dirty little life 
 Dirty little thoughts in her dirty little mind 
 Dirty little lips tell dirty little lies 
 My dirty little girl 
 ... Then I don't know?
