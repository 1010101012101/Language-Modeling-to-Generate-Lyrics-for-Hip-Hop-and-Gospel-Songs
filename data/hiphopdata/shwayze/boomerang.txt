I come and go like a boomerang 
 Set me free and I'll come back again 
 To and from like a freigh train 
 Stoppin' in your town 
 I walk in the place, stuck in outterspace 
 Talkin' to my friends they don't know what I say 
 I'm in the ocean duck, divin the waves 
 I'm on a mountain been climbin for days 
 The top of the world is just up the way 
 Said the blind man wavin a sage 
 Chapter five, 29th page 
 Time ain't the only thing move in the day 
 I gotta go gotta get away 
 Let the sunset just set away 
 On the deck tryna catch a ray 
 Some girl in a dress will say 
 Please don't leave me 
 Please don't leave me (whoa) 
 Stop 'n' go it's just rock 'n' roll 
 Soul brother on the yellow brickroad 
 Dressed up, ready to go 
 With my hair messed up and some regular clothes 
 Guess what? I'm strikin a pose 
 So you can make a statue I suppose 
 Lights camera then I froze 
 Thoughts of you in my head arose 
 She loves me like a pedal on a rose 
 I love her not last pedal on the floor 
 On the deck tryna catch a ray 
 Some girl in a dress will say 
 Please don't leave me 
 Please don't leave me (whoa) 
 (Whoa) 
 Believe me this time I'm leavin' 
 For a little bit longer than a weekend 
 And when you see me, I'll be rockin' 
 On your TV I know you're watchin 
 And I'll be thinkin' of you often 
 Everytime that I see a rose blossom 
 On the deck tryna catch a ray 
 Some girl in a dress will say 
 Please don't leave me 
 Please don't leave me (whoa)
