 You know the real fun starts when the curtains close, 
 Head down the road, to the motel 6,

 Lookin' like a parade with all the chicks in tow, 
 Sneak past the lobby, fast like Ricky Bobby, 
 Strait to the pool, skinny dipping party!

 And if you don't know where to go you better ask somebody, 
 Or come with us we got room on the bus,
