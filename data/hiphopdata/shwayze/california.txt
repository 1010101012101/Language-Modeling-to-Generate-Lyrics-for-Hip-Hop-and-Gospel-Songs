"I want to say one thing 
 To the American people. 
 And I want you to listen to me. 
 I'm not going to say this again. 
 I did not have sexual relations 
 With that woman." 
 I was framed 
 I don't even know her name 
 Dame came in with an 
 Eight ball of cocaine 
 Low range 
 Got sprang off my pinky rang 
 I got my pee-pee wet 
 She had a stinky thing 
 I got a dance in 
 She did the chicken wing 
 No romancin' 
 Straight to stickin' things 
 In places 
 Gave her a bracelet 
 Said I'll be back in the mornin' 
 Be patient 
 So she was waitin' 
 But I never came in 
 I was on the next plane to Vegas, amen 
 Take a statement 
 Your honor I'm a changed man 
 Game plan to blow up like Iran 
 My man train like the Taliban 
 I'm from Cali man 
 We smoke the good shit 
 "I want you to listen to me." 
 Sex lives and video tapin 
 I can't believe my eyes 
 What I'm seein today, man 
 Is everything fake in 
 Californ-i-a 
 (In Californ-i-a) 
 Sex lives and video tapin 
 I can't believe my ears 
 When I hear what they say man 
 Everything's fake in 
 Californ-i-a 
 (In California) 
 Playground 
 Born and raised 
 I had to make more then 
 Minimum wage so 
 ("Authorities said they found more than seven ounces of marajuana in his luggage.") 
 Ah hell no 
 I'm just tryin' to get by 
 I'm just tryin' to get by 
 But I'm tryin' to get high 
 While I'm tryin' to get by 
 I'm just tryin' to get your 
 Pussy wet 
 Every night 
 Like a super soaker 
 Let's have a water fight 
 I got a place 
 That I want you to see 
 A little suite 
 On a hill by the sea 
 A couple G's is all I need 
 From ya 
 Come on babe 
 I'll scrape ya knees fo ya 
 Country momma, let me be 
 Yo honey baby 
 You used to love me, love me 
 Now you actin' pissy lately 
 Is it 'cause you heard about my 
 Pretty city lady? 
 Can't we all just get along 
 And make some pretty 
 Little babies? 
 I been pimpin' since 
 The eighties 
 I been pimpin' since 
 The eighties 
 "Come up and see me sometime, anytime, 
 The sooner the better."

 Shake your body 
 Like a brokin' washing machine 
 Get you clean 
 Then dirty again 
 Shwayz on the airwaves 
 Ray-ban shades 
 Stay chillin' on my face 
 Like oil of Olay 
 Mo' money 
 Mo' problems 
 I got no problems homie 
 Only thing I got is some 
 Condoms a boombox 
 Papers, weed and beer 
 Sleepin' on the couch 
 For the last three years 
 Still pimpin'... 
 ("Now I want you to listen to me...")
