Yo, yo 
 It's Thursday night 
 And I ain't tryin' to think 
 So I hit the bar 
 To get a blue drink 
 I want to find some cute girl 
 Believe me 
 But I want a fly chick 
 One who ain't too easy 
 And just then 
 She walked in 
 With a dude on her side 
 To shy to be her boyfriend 
 And just then I stepped in 
 I'm far from shy 
 Bowed like a felt pen 
 She said there's more to life 
 Then the money 
 And the limelight 
 You only find it when the times 
 Right 
 I'm just tryin' to get laid 
 So I'm like, yeah right 
 And then she disappeared 
 Into the night, to the night 
 My blood runs cold (Say what?) 
 My memories 
 Have just been sold (Hell no) 
 My angel is a centerfold (She's what?) 
 My angel is a centerfold (Hell no) 
 My blood runs cold (Say what?) 
 My memories 
 Have just been sold (Hell no) 
 (She's what?) 
 My angel is a centerfold (Hell no) 
 Oh no 
 Won't believe what I saw 
 At the magazine stand 
 At the fox hills mall 
 A face I seen 
 But not in my dreams 
 In between my sheets 
 In the massage dreams 
 Cute button nose 
 She strikin' a pose 
 On the cover of vogue 
 Man I wish I woulda known 
 So good-lookin' 
 It hurts my heart 
 'Cause I seen her looking better 
 With her make up off 
 She said there's more to life 
 Then the money 
 And the limelight 
 You only find it when the times 
 Right 
 I'm just tryin' to get laid 
 So I'm like, yeah right 
 And then she disappeared 
 Into the night, to the night 
 My blood runs cold (Say what?) 
 My memories 
 Have just been sold (Hell no) 
 My angel is a centerfold (She's what?) 
 My angel is a centerfold (Hell no) 
 My blood runs cold (Say what?) 
 My memories 
 Have just been sold (Hell no) 
 (She's what?) 
 My angel is a centerfold (Hell no) 
 Yo 
 She said there's more to life 
 Then a bong and a pipe 
 A beat and a snare 
 And the songs that you write 
 So I thought to myself 
 Am I wrong or right? 
 It's going to be a long night 
 All right 
 My blood runs cold (Say what?) 
 My memories 
 Have just been sold (Hell no) 
 My angel is a centerfold (She's what?) 
 My angel is a centerfold (Hell no) 
 My blood runs cold (Say what?) 
 My memories 
 Have just been sold (Hell no) 
 Na na na-na-na-na (She's what?) 
 My angel is a centerfold (Hell no)
