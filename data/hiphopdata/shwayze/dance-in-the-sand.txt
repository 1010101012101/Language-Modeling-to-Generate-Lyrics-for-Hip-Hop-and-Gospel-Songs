Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Certainly you should be filled with uncertainty 
 For 13 years I've been hurtin' girls purposely 
 I've been called a worthless freak, a jerk, and a cheat 
 'Cause I turn the other cheek after we fuck for a week 
 Stop cryin', you know that I done learned from these mistakes 
 That I made but the past keeps burning me 
 Like meatheads with cigarettes on freshmens and fraternities 
 But Shway say how about burnin' herbal trees with purple leaves 
 I'm sorry that I hurt your heart but that's just the part 
 That you're playing in my autobiography 
 I'm sorry that I did you wrong 
 I promise that I'll write a song and play it for you 
 As my apology 
 We gonna walk in twilight 
 We gonna run in moonshine 
 We gonna dance in the sand tonight 
 We gonna walk in twilight 
 We gonna run in moonshine 
 We gonna dance in the sand tonight 
 (You know what?) 
 Maybe girl, you wasn't meant to be my babygirl 
 Shwayze's just a player where this stage is just my crazy world 
 But lately lovely I've been thinkin' of you all the time 
 All my friends say I gotta put it all far behind 
 But I don't mind, they just jealous you get all my time (yup) 
 I saw the signs you my ace and base damn you fine (damn) 
 You got shwayze shakin the rattle, the rattle, cryin like a baby 
 'Cause I sleepless in Seattle 
 Why you in Hollywood long legs, short skirt 
 Tellin' all the dudes how you made my feelin's hurt? 
 We gonna walk in twilight 
 We gonna run in moonshine 
 We gonna dance in the sand tonight 
 We gonna walk in twilight 
 We gonna run in moonshine 
 We gonna dance in the sand tonight 
 Dance in the sand 
 We gonna dance in the sand 
 Dance in the sand like a street fuckin' sand 
 Yes I am what I am 
 What I am is a man 
 We gonna dance in the sand 
 Dance in the sand, tonight 
 Dance in the sand 
 'Cause we ain't got it planned 
 Two peas in a pod you and I, me and you 
 And love is a bitch 
 Let's hold hands let's get rich 
 Romance in the stone 
 Make a home out the house 
 We'll roam in the day 
 You know what they say 
 Every pimp needs a hoe and a lady 
 We gonna walk in (ay!) twilight 
 We gonna run in (oh!) moonshine 
 We gonna dance in (ay!) the sand tonight 
 (Every pimp needs a hoe)
