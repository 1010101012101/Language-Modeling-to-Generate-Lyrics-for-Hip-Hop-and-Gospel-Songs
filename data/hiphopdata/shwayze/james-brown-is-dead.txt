The man on the radio said 
 James Brown is dead 
 The godfather of soul, lays in his bed 
 (Have you heard what the kids are listening to?) 
 Yo, uh, 
 Woke up, (Got high) 
 Sho'nuff (Sky high) 
 Got in the ride turned the radio up, 
 Then they said James Brown was dead 
 Is it true? Or am I just doped up 
 Know what? I'm calling my folks up, 
 They said he died 'cause hip hop sucks 
 Ain't got no soul like a old pair of chucks, 
 It's about time that somebody stepped up 
 And the man on the radio said (I regret to report) 
 James Brown is dead (just press record) 
 The godfather of soul, lays in his bed 
 (Have you heard what the kids are listening to?) 
 Hit the studio (Check 1, 2) 
 Sho'nuff, Yo Cisco turn my headphones up 
 I got a message for the kids of America 
 Play it loud in your Hi-Fi stereo 
 Wi-Fi, download the ringtone, 
 California Love is your theme song 
 Drop the guitar, letme hear the beat y'all, 
 Do like Dr. Brown and move your feet y'all 
 I just got back from a little vacation 
 Grew some wings and flew to Vegas 
 Met a girl, took her 'round the world, 
 Form New York, New York to Caesar's 
 Now I'm sitting in L.A. alone 
 I fell asleep with my blue jeans on 
 I woke up had three missed calls 
 They said: James Brown is gone 
 (James Brown is Dead) 
 I regret to report 
 Have you heard what the kids are listening to? 
 I regret to report James Brown is Dead 
 I regret to report James Brown is dead 
 Have you heard what the kids are listening to? 
 And the man on the radio said (I regret to report) 
 James Brown is dead (just press record) 
 The godfather of soul, lays in his bed
