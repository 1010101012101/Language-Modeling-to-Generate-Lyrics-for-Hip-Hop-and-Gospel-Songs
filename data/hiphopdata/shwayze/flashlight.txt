Ay yo 
 It's 6 AM and I'm drinkin' a brew, 
 6:45 still thinkin' of you 
 Thinkin' who, wanna give they love to you 
 Better than the only black kid in the booth 
 I ain't from the hood but my rap is good 
 Knocked three times on the Cadillac wood 
 Kid got luck like a rabbit's foot 
 Shit is good, yeah shit is good 
 Chillin' in the sand with my video cam 
 Swallowed the benzo that azapam 
 Sports illustrated model gettin' tan 
 Said "Damn Shwayze you kinda like the man" 
 Get I am and I'm big in Japan 
 My pic and my hair and my dick and my hand 
 What would you do with a hundred grand? 
 Shit, I'd buy a fresh-ass Benz 
 When she walked in thst club that night, 
 She had a look in her eye like a flashlight 
 She said baby I'm a be all right 
 And the DJ put on our favorite song 
 And we danced between the lights 
 Left the club when it's light outside, 
 She sing along to my songs in the ride 
 "It's all right we can call it a night", 
 I said politely even though it didn't sound right, 
 She said "yeah right" 
 I said "damn straight" 
 I know a place where we can get down babe, 
 I got a blanky, 
 I'll lay it on the sand sand 
 I went deep like the god damn Grand Can, 
 Grand slam, bacon and the ham, 
 She was a fan that turned to a friend, 
 But now I think I love her since I took her to bed 
 She shook up my head, 
 Took all my time, 
 Spit all my money on diamonds and wine, 
 What would you do with a hundred grand? 
 Shit I spent it all on a girl man, 
 What would you do with a hundred grand? 
 Shit I'd buy a fresh ass benz 
 When she walked in thst club that night, 
 She had a look in her eye like a flashlight 
 She said baby I'm a be all right 
 And the DJ put on our favorite song 
 And we danced between the lights 
 When she walked in thst club that night, 
 She had a look in her eye like a flashlight 
 She said baby I'm a be all right 
 And the DJ put on our favorite song 
 And we danced between the lights 
 You got a light? Boy I got a spliff 
 Gotta split got a life to live 
 I gotta get gotta write some shit 
 On the tip of my tongue just like a kiss 
 I might miss but I might just hit 
 And if I do I'm a be hella rich 
 And I'll get a way finer bitch 
 So you better be nice sweet lips 
 And I might just buy you a benz 
 When she walked in thst club that night, 
 She had a look in her eye like a flashlight 
 She said baby I'm a be all right 
 And the DJ put on our favorite song
