First name Bianca, last name no-way 
 Bitch stole my heart like I used to in the old days 
 Booty so soft like the oil of the Olay 
 But I can't get the bag, well okay 
 She one night stand me, now she can't stand me 
 Every time she see me red carpet at the Grammys 
 Its cool, I'mma get my chance 
 Just like homie from save the last dance 
 So save the last hit and save the last shot 
 Party with the pretty girls in flip flops 
 Chilling on the beach with the new one too 
 Get it, now that's a new one-two 
 They say every star gotta shine 
 Well I guess I got mine 
 I'm on my own, well I'm in my zone 
 And I ain't staying home tonight 
 Ain't no party like a west coast party 
 'Cause a west coast party don't stop 
 You know we gone party like a west coast party 
 Till somebody calls the cops 
 Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah 
 First name gorgeous, last name don't-care 
 Don't worry 'bout the haters baby they ain't going nowhere 
 Tell me where you wanna go, Ill just put the show there 
 They calling you a ho but it really ain't no fair 
 Wardrobe crazy, hanging with Shwayze 
 You know I like white girls, I gotta mixed baby 
 Shout out to my sisters I could be your mister 
 Don't be mad when my jeans don't fit ya 
 Skinny dude, big dick, all about my stick shift 
 No I ain't a skater but Ill shove it in your chick quick 
 California veteran, New York resident 
 Smoking on the medicine, the next black president 
 Yo I crash boat parties and snag a few hotties 
 Party on the weekdays, sleep on the weekends 
 And when the sun sets were gone do it all again 
 Ain't no party like a west coast party 
 'Cause a west coast party don't stop 
 You know we gone party like a west coast party 
 Till somebody calls the cops 
 Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah 
 Ain't no party like a west coast party 
 'Cause a west coast party don't stop 
 You know we gone party like a west coast party 
 Till somebody calls the cops 
 Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah 
 Ain't no party like a west coast party 
 'Cause a west coast party don't stop 
 You know we gone party like a west coast party 
 Till somebody calls the cops 
 Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Everybody say hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah
