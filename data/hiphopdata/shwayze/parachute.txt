I gotta couple problems 
 But who don't? 
 123... 
 All I ever needed was a pair of shoes 
 A dollar in my pocket 
 And a parachute 
 Air-o-plane that I can take to the sky to find you 
 All I ever needed was a pair of shoes 
 A dollar in my pocket 
 And a parachute 
 Air-o-plane that I can take to the sky to find you 
 Air-o-plane that I can take to the sky 
 Air-o-plane that I can take to the sky to find you 
 Ima simple man 
 With a dangerous mind 
 I take my time 
 Sex and wine 
 I'm one of a kind 
 Ain't no fucking wit mine 
 My baby got me wishin that the sun would shine 
 Everybody wanna fall in love some day 
 Wit a six foot super model running down the runway 
 I found mine, 
 Walking in the park 
 On a Sunday night 
 We gunna get together 'cause it feels so right 
 Feels so right sleepin' in my bed tonight 
 It's been a hard days work 
 I bet your soul hurts 
 Yes-sir 
 No-sir 
 Find the folders 
 Pile the boulders 
 On top of your shoulders 
 I wanna get high and hold ya 
 Be good like I told ya I would 
 You know it's all good 
 Lets take it easy like, 123...

 Love is a drug 
 Sex is obliged 
 She was sexin all over me 
 Like what? 
 She said she like it slow 
 So I sped it up 
 To switch it up 
 When I hit it up 
 The sweat was drippin 
 Her dog was trippin' 
 While the Chihuahua was barkin and bitchin 
 Scratchin and itchin 
 Bathroom and kitchen 
 I'm a specialist 
 In all positions 
 Exceptional 
 Pussy professional 
 In love with your body 
 Like a vegan loves vegetables 
 Eatable underwear 
 Taste like strawberries under there 
 Come to papa bear, mama bear 
 I gotta couple problems 
 But who don't? 
 Now don't try to tell me that you don't 
 But we can work 'em out together 
 Its easy like 123...

 I was born on the beach 
 Got sand in my fro 
 Hands in my pockets 
 Ain't got no dou 
 But I got soul 
 Ask james brown 
 He gave me the crown when he left town 
 I'm the sex machine 
 Babies, text message me 
 Takin' my paper like I'm a god dam fax machine 
 I gotta couple problems 
 But who don't? 
 Now don't try and tell me that you don't 
 But we can work 'em out together
