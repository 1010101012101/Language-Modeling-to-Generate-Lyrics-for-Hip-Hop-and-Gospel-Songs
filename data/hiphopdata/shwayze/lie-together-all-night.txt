For just one night I want to be your man 
 We can get high and watch the sunrise 
 For just one night I want to be your man 
 We can get just lie 
 Lie together all night 
 It's Friday night 
 That means it on 
 Going everywhere 
 And we drinkin' patron 
 Hands in the air 
 And we party till dawn 
 All the pretty girls sayin' 
 (Gimme' ya love) 
 I'm in the spotlight 
 I'm startin' to squint 
 She got me for my money but it's already spent 
 I know she's gonna love me when I'm rich again 
 She'll be down on her knees sayin' 
 (Gimme' ya love) 
 It's a funny thing 
 The type of drama that money bring 
 Diva eyes watering like an onion ring 
 Then had the never to lie right in front of me 
 Don't lie girl 
 Less ya lyin' under me 
 For just one night I want to be your man 
 We can get high and watch the sunrise 
 For just one night I want to be your man 
 We can get just lie 
 Lie together all night 
 It's Saturday night 
 That means it's on 
 She's in her high heels 
 So she thinks she grown 
 But she's a little girl 
 And she's all alone 
 Lookin' for her daddy sayin' 
 (Gimme' ya love) 
 I'm in the high life 
 Like a Miller beer 
 Our weed have to cost about a mill a year 
 Do you wanna get high 
 You can meet me right here 
 West coast bitch 
 (Gimme' ya love) 
 It's some funny shit 
 How the weed make ya chicken get 
 Then ya broke 
 And she eat all your chicken strips 
 And had the nerve 
 To blame it on some other shit 
 Don't lie 
 Less' I'm the one ya lyin' with 
 Ya know what I mean? 
 Let's lie together all night 
 (All I wanna do is be your man) 
 I lie to you 
 You lie with me 
 For just one night I want to be your man 
 We can get high and watch the sunrise 
 For just one night I want to be your man 
 We can get just lie 
 Lie together all night 
 For just one night I want to be your man 
 We can get high and watch the sunrise 
 For just one night I want to be your man 
 We can get just lie 
 Lie together all night 
 Lemme' tell you bout' a girl I know 
 She like hip-hop and rock and roll 
 Lemme' tell you bout' a girl I know 
 She like hip-hop and rock and roll
