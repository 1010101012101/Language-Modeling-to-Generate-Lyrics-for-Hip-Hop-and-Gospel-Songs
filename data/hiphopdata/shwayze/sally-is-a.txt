Sally is a Hippie girl one day 
 Sally is a Rock chick the next 
 Sally is a Hiphop Baby then a drip pop lady 
 But there's one thing Sally says everyday, its 
 She loves me, She loves me just the way I am (yeah) 
 She loves me, She loves me just the way I am 
 (Hey, hey, hey) 
 I got a girl named Sally, she like to keep it trendy 
 One day its hippy chic, next day its gucci fendi 
 She got a gold chain, like it was 1980 
 She buys 3 magazines a week, just to see who I'm datin' 
 I been to Paris, London, & still... I come back to Sally 
 'Cause I know how she feels

 I got a girly girl, but she's a tomboy 
 She like to go nuts, my little almond joy 
 I try to make her blush, but she's just way too tough 
 Yeah she's so emo with her makeup and her haircut 
 She's a rich girl but she could careless; American Apparel 
 With her dads American Express. She's a college girl 
 Lettin' lose at night In a mini skirt, sippin' goose and sprite 
 She's all around the world, she ain't your average girl 
 And every time I leave, I'm comin' back to her

 To all my Sally's out there, put your hearts in the air 
 Tell me where you wanna go and I take you there 
 I take you there, girl I take you there I take you there
