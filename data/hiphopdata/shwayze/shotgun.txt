I don't want you in my passenger seat 
 Not anyone can be my shotgun 
 I don't want you ridin' next to me 
 I ride alone 
 I remember all those times I went to pick you up 
 At your mommas house in my pickup truck 
 We drive out of town like a lightning bolt 
 No place to go just dreams and hope 
 Weed and flows is all I need 
 I tried to tell you before 
 You went and fell for me 
 And I fell for you for a second or two 
 But I caught myself by the string of my shoe 
 Now I'm singing to you to let you know 
 That I'm sorry but I just gotta let you go 
 I only got one love one heart one mind one drug... turn it up 
 All those times I left and came right back 
 Like a boomerang or an echo on a track 
 You consume my thoughts when I'm here or there 
 Near or far you can gimme a call 
 Don't take my pictures of the wall just yet 
 I gotta go right now but I'll be back in a sec 
 I'm a miss you like I miss my bed 
 Lying there cryin with my pillow on my head 
 No woman, no cry. No fear, no tears in my eyes. Know why? 
 Sittin' all alone and ya waitin by the phone 
 But you don't know what to do 
 Daddy's upstairs but we know he don't care about you 
 You can cry cry cry yourself to sleep tonight 
 I know everythings gonna be all right without you... without you 
 One love 
 One heart 
 One mind 
 One drug turn it up
