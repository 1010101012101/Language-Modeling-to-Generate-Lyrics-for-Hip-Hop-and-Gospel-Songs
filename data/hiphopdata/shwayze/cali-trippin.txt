Cali' Trippin' and I think my mind is slippin' away 
 Cali' Trippin' and I'm wishin' I was back in LA 
 Once apon a time, I wrote a lil' rhyme 
 About a pretty girl, she was in her prime 
 I'm a skinny boy, in my skinny jeans 
 And mini-me was poppin' out my corduroys 
 She was a dime, I ain't have a nickel 
 But I had jokes, so I made her giggle 
 And her folks were very influential 
 So when I smoked that adam made her feel like a bad girl 
 But she's a good girl, in a bad world 
 So I felt bad for correcting her 
 Not really, but her dad would kill me 
 So I told her we had to slow it down 
 She said; I wanna Rock (I wanna Rock) 
 And roll a joint, and get high (And get high) 
 Don't talk, just vibe 
 Let's get in the ride, and just drive 
 If you got nothing good to say 
 Then don't say shit 
 And it's always easier to forget 
 We cali' trippin', you gotta love it 
 And ain't nothing wrong with making out in public 
 Taking pictures of girls on a trip around the world 
 And it, just reminds me of everything I miss back home 
 Cali' trippin' and I think my mind is slippin' away 
 Cali' trippin' and I'm wishin' I was back in LA 
 She was so fine, but she was out of mind 
 Goin' full speed, crash on the autobon 
 She get what she wants, she get it from her mom 
 And her dad show us love with the credit card 
 Where do I fit in? I'm the token black 
 With a coke and jack, lookin' for the right girl 
 The reason that I'm loving you, is the way that you do you 
 I wanna Rock (I wanna Rock) 
 And roll a joint, and get high (And get high) 
 Don't talk, just vibe 
 Let's get in the ride, and just drive 
 If you got nothing good to say 
 Then don't say shit 
 And it's always easier to forget 
 We cali' trippin', you gotta love it 
 And ain't nothing wrong with making out in public 
 Taking pictures of girls on a trip around the world 
 And it, just reminds me of everything I miss back home 
 Cali' trippin' and I think my mind is slippin away 
 Cali' trippin' and I'm wishin' I was back in LA 
 I'm Cali' Trippin', I'm Cali' Trippin' 
 I'm Cali' Trippin', I'm Cali' Trippin' 
 I'm Cali' Trippin', I'm Cali' Trippin' 
 Cali' Trippin' Baby, Cali' Trippin' yeah 
 Cali' Trippin' Baby, Cali' Trippin' yeah 
 Cali' Trippin' Baby, Cali' Trippin' yeah 
 Cali' Trippin' Baby, Cali' Trippin' 
 I wanna Rock (I wanna Rock) 
 And roll a joint, and get high (And get high) 
 Don't talk, just vibe 
 Let's get in the ride, and just drive 
 If you got nothing good to say 
 Then don't say shit 
 And it's always easier to forget 
 We cali' trippin', you gotta love it 
 And ain't nothing wrong with making out in public 
 Taking pictures of girls on a trip around the world 
 And it, just reminds me of everything I miss back home 
 Cali' trippin' and I think my mind is slippin away 
 Cali' trippin' and I'm wishin' I was back in LA 
 (Ain't nothin' wrong wit making out in public) 
 (Wishin' I was back in LA) 
 (Ain't nothin' wrong wit makin' out in public) 
 (Wishin' I was back in LA) 
 (Ain't nothing wrong wit makin' out in public) 
 I like the way the chain sits, between her bra and tits 
 Takin' bong hits with her and I'm on assist 
 I must admit she got me on that sprung shit 
 I can't deny she got me on that young shit 
 It's all good 'cause she got my back 
 Like a JanSport backpack culdesec 
 It's funny 'cause we both used to ditch class 
 The kiss in the back of the cabbage patch 
 Rat-a-tat-tat on the window pane 
 Outside lookin' in but I won't complain 
 Too many highs turn down the game 
 And don't be surprised when I say that name 
 Jane Bang Cali-forn-i-a
