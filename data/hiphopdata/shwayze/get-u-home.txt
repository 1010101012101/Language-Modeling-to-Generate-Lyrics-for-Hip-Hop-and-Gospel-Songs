She look like sex, drugs, rock and roll 
 When she move it on the dance floor 
 Stop, go, stop and go 
 Like a New York cab yo 
 Fast, slow, fast and slow 
 She drives me mad yo 
 Just like my nano 
 She shuffling, I'm lovin' it 
 I'm thinking about touchin it 
 Kissin' her in public 
 But baby got me fumblin, 
 Stumblin, and mumblin 
 She got me wonderin, 
 If I should get her number then 
 She just looked up at me and said 
 Take me in the bathroom 
 Take my clothes off 
 Make love to me up against a dirty wall 
 'Cause I can't wait to get you home (wait to get you home) 
 She tastes like cigarettes and alcohol 
 Up all night on aderoll 
 Innocent, but not at all 
 She my Brooklyn Barbie doll 
 Dancin like (mmm), fakin like (oh) 
 What you think about sex on the first night? (okay) 
 I'm thinking about touchin it 
 Kissin' her in public 
 But baby got me fumblin, 
 Stumblin, and mumblin 
 She got me wonderin, 
 If I should get her number then 
 I just looked at her instead (I said) 
 Take me in the bathroom 
 Take my clothes off 
 Make love to me up against a dirty wall 
 'Cause I can't wait to get you home (wait to get you home) 
 Take me out the back door 
 Take my clothes off 
 Make love to me up against somebodys car 
 'Cause I can't wait to get you home (wait to get you home) 
 She was a waitress 
 Wait, she was an actress 
 I, dimmed like a starlet, in fact she was a harlot 
 Her lips like Scarlet, Johansson 
 They part to say I'm handsome 
 I start to say I know 
 That's when she pulled out my handgun (bam) 
 Take me in the bathroom 
 Take my clothes off 
 Make love to me up against a dirty wall 
 'Cause I can't wait to get you home (wait to get you home) 
 Take me out the back door 
 Take my clothes off 
 Make love to me up against somebodys car 
 'Cause I can't wait to get you 
 'Cause I can't wait to get you home
