Come alone leave your daddy at home 
 I promise that we'll have a good time 
 Tell your mama that your sleeping out tonight 
 Someone in the back of the dimly lit club 
 Sittin' back while my jimmy gettin' love 
 Gettin' hugs, kisses, and bud 
 And free drinks from my bartender 
 A yo 
 Pretty girl hittin' me up 
 She think I'm Nick Cannon so she givin' it up 
 Wildin' out livin' it up 
 Put my hand on her leg and started movin' it up 
 1 for the money 
 2 for the show 
 3 for the honies with the pretty painted toes 
 No school tomorrow got a doctors note 
 But if you comin' to my party leave your daddy at home 
 Back of the crib with a bottle of Jadlyn 
 A bottle of Vooge and a hundred dollar weed sack 
 She baught it all 
 I said I'll pay it back with a little of this 
 And a little of that 
 But she never seen a condom with a golden wrapper 
 She said she like my show 
 I said no I'm a rapper 
 Oh well we'll talk about it after 
 Let's get sexual and graphic 
 1 for the money 
 2 for the show 
 3 for the honies with the pretty painted toes 
 No school tomorrow got a docters note 
 But if you comin' to my party leave your daddy at home 
 Leave your daddy at home 
 Leave your daddy at home 
 If you comin'to my party leave your daddy at home 
 Leave your daddy at home 
 Leave your daddy at home 
 If you comin' to my party tell yo' mama write a note 
 Come alone leave your daddy at home 
 I promise that we'll have a good time 
 Tell your mama that your sleeping out tonight 
 Come alone leave your daddy at home 
 I promise that we'll have a good time (if you comin' to my party leave your daddy at home) 
 Baby doll you ain't gonna sleep at all tonight (if you comin' to my party leave your daddy at home) 
 Yo 
 It was a good time baby 
 You treated me well 
 And your parents raised you right 
 From what I could tell 
 I'd love to see you soon 
 It sure was swell 
 But I right a fazooa like montezuma 
 (Pre-Chrous) 
 1 for the money 
 2 for the show 
 3 for the honies with the pretty painted toes 
 No school tomorrow got a doctors note 
 But if you comin' to my party leave your daddy at home 
 Leave your daddy at home 
 Leave your daddy at home 
 If you comin' to my party leave your daddy at home 
 Leave your daddy at home 
 Leave your daddy at home 
 If you comin' to my party tell your mama write a note
