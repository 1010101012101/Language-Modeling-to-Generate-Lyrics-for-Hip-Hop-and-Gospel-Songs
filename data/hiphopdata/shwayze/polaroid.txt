 Yo, at a party on the hill, I popped a pill 
 Threw back a shot and started to chill 
 Ran into a pretty thing named Jane Bang 
 She said she liked the way I handled my game 
 I said thanks, I like the way you handle my thang 
 She said thanks, now that's money in the bank 
 So I walked away, towards the bar, 
 Bumped into a hottie named Holly in the hall 
 Could've been a ménage à trois 
 But her friend never heard my music before 
 So I walked outside to get a little high 
 When I got a little bump on my side from a fly 
 Blue-eyed baby with sex on the mind 
 Sally's from the valley, but Sally's still fine 
 Hopped in the ride, and started to drive 
 She said, "What's my name?" 
 I said, "I dunno, Jane?"

 Yo, uh, at a party on the beach 
 I was smokin' like Cheech 
 Scopin' out a hot piece of ass I'm a creep 
 Getting head while the radio speaks 
 Popped like the bubble in these sneaks 
 Yo Jennifer, or was it Monique 
 That chick got dolphins tattoed on her feet 
 Last week, I seen a best friend 
 Undressin' a Madison in the westend 
 Exit, cut to breakfast 
 Eggs benidict and a fresh pearl necklace 
 Legs in the air like a goddamn gymnast 
 Please God, I beg for forgiveness 
 Then she asked if I've been to Memphis 
 I said no, but I'm a fan of Elvis 
 That's where I learned to move my pelvis 
 She said, "What's my name?" 
 I said, "Jane?"

 Yeah, yo, uh 
 At a party at my crib, I can't remember what I did 
 Woke up with a semi-hard dick and a fat chick 
 Three days a week, call that a hat trick 
 But everybody knows hockey ain't for black kids 
 They call me Shwayze, kinda like Patrick 
 Pinnin' every dome in Hollywood to the mattress 
 Sin in every city, LA to Manhattan 
 Grinnin like I'm guilty, but I dunno what happened 
 So someone take her picture (click, click)
