If you call me on the telephone 
 Sorry love I'm not at home 
 I'm out on the town roamin' 
 Leave a message after the tone 
 And I'll get back to you in the mornin' 
 Oh yeah 
 Everybody in this town wanna know me now 
 'Cause every honey in this town wanna hold me down 
 Roll me 'round 'cause I'm brown like a blunt 
 So put it in the sky and tell me what you want 
 Lighter up, light, lighter up 
 Like it's 1985 and we high as fuck 
 Lighter up, light, lighter up 
 Like it's 1985 and we high 
 Yo, I kick of my shoes 
 I keep the weed in my sock 
 I'm going 85 and I ain't gonna stop 
 Unless the beat drop and I see those cops 
 Try and pull me over 'cause I'm hot box 
 Windows locked, stay bumping that cock rock 
 In and out the carpool lane like a hot shot 
 Drop top, I got it at the chop shop 
 Mario don' owe me one favor for that ganja 
 If you call me on the telephone 
 Sorry love I'm not at home 
 I'm out on the town roamin' 
 Leave a message after the tone 
 And I'll get back to you in the mornin' 
 Oh yeah, yeah 
 Yo, I'm a breast man, face man, leg man, ass man 
 Gentleman? Yes ma'am 
 Ask them, they my client√®le 
 And their eyes is red 'cause they high as hell 
 Brain like baboon, body like Gizelle 
 Lady gazelle run fast as hell 
 I'm the shit, ma, that's the smell 
 The next big thing, can't ya tell 
 The phone ring, can't pick it up 
 Life moving too fast, gotta live it up 
 Gotta live it up, can't trade a Trans AM for a pick-up truck 
 Yo, I work hard all day in the garden 
 And it's starting to show for something 
 Limousine that they chauffeur son in 
 Drive me around with the music bumping 
 Listen, call me on the telephone 
 Sorry love, I'm not at home 
 I'm out on the town, roamin' 
 Leave a message after the tone 
 And I'll get back to you in the morning 
 If you call me on the telephone 
 Sorry love I'm not at home

 Leave a message after the tone 
 And I'll get back to you in the mornin' 
 (One more time man)

 Leave a message after the tone 
 And I'll get back to you in the mornin' 
 Oh yeah 
 Fuck, fuck yeah, yeah I'm high 
 How you think a brother man supposed to survive 
 Take five, matter fact take a drive 
 And think about life while you still got time 
 Smoke a little weed, drop a couple rhymes 
 Make a couple dollars to save a couple dimes 
 Draw a couple lines on some paper, make a sign 
 Hang it on my dressing room door, it's time 
 If you call me on the telephone 
 Sorry love I'm not at home 
 I'm out on the town roamin' 
 Leave a message after the tone 
 And I'll get back to you in the mornin' 
 Oh yeah 
 Everybody in this town wanna know me now 
 'Cause every honey in the town wanna hold me down 
 Roll me 'round 'cause I'm brown like a blunt 
 So put it in the sky and tell me what you want 
 Lighter up, light, lighter up 
 Like it's 1985 and we high as fuck 
 Lighter up, light, lighter up 
 Like it's 1985 and we high as fuck 
 Yo, I kick off my shoes
