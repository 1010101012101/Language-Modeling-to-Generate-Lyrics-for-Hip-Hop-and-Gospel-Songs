And the hours shakin' 
 But I was running on empty baby 
 Do you know what that can do to you 
 Looks like I need a little jet fuel 
 It was 6AM I was drunk off gin 
 Swervin' through the lanes all over 
 I had a brunette woo woo 
 She had a body like a corvette 
 Vroom vroom 
 Soon me and you will hit the both 
 I'll be buzzin' like a fly on shit to you 
 And there's somethin' when I slide up into you 
 So comfortable 
 You come for me and I'll come for you 
 I'll meet you in the middle 
 Like a twinkie's fillin' 
 Give me a sip of that drink you're spillin' 
 Give me a sip of that drink you're spillin' 
 It was Saturday night 
 I was feelin' alright 
 I bought a ticket to paradise 
 Her daddy was away on a business trip 
 She said, "Shwayze, you wanna hit this shit?" 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 Yeah I'm about too. 
 And the hours shakin' 
 But I was running on empty baby 
 Do you know what that can do to you 
 Looks like I need a little jet fuel 
 I filled up at a spot hit the road 
 Stopped a couple houses down the road 
 Her best friend Roe opened the door 
 She said, "Woah, motherfucker your dick is exposed!" 
 I gave her a smile, said. "Child, I know!" 
 Give me a sip of that drink you're spillin' 
 It was Saturday night 
 I was feelin' alright 
 I bought a ticket to paradise 
 Her daddy was away on a business trip 
 She said, "Shwayze, you wanna hit this shit?" 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 Yeah I'm about too. 
 I got home smelling like cheap cologne 
 Lookin' like an empty glass of jack and coke 
 I said woah I need a wakeup call 
 Wake up girl, I'll leave my door unlocked 
 Little miss slipped in a slip 
 Silk butterscotch dip spillin' on my quilt 
 Lift up her legs 'til I get to the feature presentation 
 Vibration breakin' the bed 
 The lovely maiden got me shakin' my head 
 Leavin' the sheets all covered in sweat 
 Blood and tears you'd think it was a soap opera 
 These are my golden years 
 It was Saturday night 
 I was feelin' alright 
 I bought a ticket to paradise 
 Her daddy was away on a business trip 
 She said, "Shwayze, you wanna hit this shit?" 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 Yeah I'm about too. 
 I'll be buzzin' like a fly on shit to you 
 And it's gimme a sip of that drink you're spillin' 
 I'll be buzzin' like a fly on shit to you 
 And it's gimme a sip of that drink you're spillin' 
 It was Saturday night 
 I was feelin' alright 
 I bought a ticket to paradise 
 Her daddy was away on a business trip 
 She said, "Shwayze, you wanna hit this shit?" 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 You wanna hit this shit? 
 Yeah I'm about too.
