This heartbreak is better than most loves 
 'Cause even when we break up 
 Our heartbreak is better than most loves 
 Even when we break up 
 Your hot like cashmere I don't need that beer 
 Drunk off your love and I'm cool chilling right here 
 In school you never wouldve talked to me 
 Its cool 'cause now your getting lost with me 
 Your body is just like an hourglass 
 Its crazy how quick an hour pass 
 Know were having fun thinking about the times we had 
 'Cause even when the times were bad 
 I can't forget it, making love in public 
 Let them all see, fuck it 
 They search the world to find something like this 
 Forget it, making love in public 
 Let them all see, fuck it 
 They search the world to find something like this 
 Heartbreak is better than most loves 
 'Cause even when we break up 
 Our heartbreak is better than most loves 
 This heartbreak is better than most loves 
 'Cause even when we break up 
 Our heartbreak is better than most loves 
 Even when we break up 
 She like her man happy, tatted, ashy to classy 
 Knew she was the one right when she walked past me 
 Take a hand baby let's get out of here 
 Black man, your daddy's worst nightmare 
 Crazy, but you want it like I want it baby 
 I'm coming for your love 
 Think about the times we had 'cause even when the times were bad 
 I can't forget it, making love in public 
 Let them all see, fuck it 
 They search the world to find something like this 
 Forget it, making love in public 
 Let them all see, fuck it 
 They search the world to find something like this 
 Heartbreak is better than most loves 
 'Cause even when we break up 
 Our heartbreak is better than most loves 
 This heartbreak is better than most loves 
 'Cause even when we break up 
 Our heartbreak is better than most loves 
 Even when we break up 
 Making out in public 
 My chick is high so fuck it 
 Who are they to judge us 
 Partying for days now 
 Baby lets just lay down 
 Who are they to judge us 
 They just mad 'cause they ain't us 
 They search the world to find something like this 
 Heartbreak is better than most loves 
 'Cause even when we break up 
 Our heartbreak is better than most loves 
 Even when we break up 
 This heartbreak is better than most loves 
 'Cause even when we break up 
 Our heartbreak is better than most loves 
 Even when we break up girl
