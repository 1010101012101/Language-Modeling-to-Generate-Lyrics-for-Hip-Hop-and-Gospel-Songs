Chuch 
 If you see me when I come around 
 (That's church) 
 Breakin' all these hoes down 
 (That's church) 
 Got the Cadillacs and Bentleys 
 (That's church) 
 Got money to the ceiling, y'all 
 (That's church) 
 Everywhere I go they scream 
 (That's church) 
 Everybody, say it, now 
 (That's church) 
 I come through stompin' in my big black boots 
 I keep 'em jumpin', jumpin', stayin' funky, funky for you 
 Whether Prada, Gucci, Versace 
 My coochie draped in Le Perla, watches like Liberace 
 From my head to my stockings 
 I promise to rock this and keep it poppin' 
 Ain't no stoppin' me, naw 'cause I'm on fire like a cigarette 
 Get higher when the beat quick we stick 
 Shittin' on niggas to heeze on 'em just to eat quick 
 Recently, I've been eliminating heathens and hypocrites 
 When they see me on the streets in a screaming whip 
 It's hard to not hate so don't even trip 'cause I'm church 
 If you see me when I come around 
 (That's church) 
 Breakin' all these hoes down 
 (That's church) 
 Got the Cadillacs and Bentleys 
 (That's church) 
 Got money to the ceiling, y'all 
 (That's church) 
 Everywhere I go they scream 
 (That's church) 
 Everybody, say it, now 
 (That's church) 
 I'm church, I'm smokin', I'm sharp, I'm hot 
 I'm sexy, I'm bangin', I'm sickening, I rock 
 I'm the hottest, a hard act to follow 
 Never bite off more than I can chew up, I might swallow 
 If you got a problem, holla at me tomorrow 
 'Cause I'm too busy bein' the leader you follow 
 Nigga, I'm cold blooded in a mustard colored Ferrari 
 Somebody sure love me 
 I hit that nigga banker, count up that ugly shit I ain't buyin' 
 That's church, whatever work for you 
 I'm so tough that I just lay all my coo 
 I'm too much that I only give a little to you 
 And show you how these niggas up in Chi-town do 
 If you see me when I come around 
 (That's church) 
 Breakin' all these hoes down 
 (That's church) 
 Got the Cadillacs and Bentleys 
 (That's church) 
 Got money to the ceiling, y'all 
 (That's church) 
 Everywhere I go they scream 
 (That's church) 
 Everybody, say it now 
 (That's church) 
 Like Caddies and furs 
 (Chuch) 
 House in the suburbs 
 (Chuch) 
 Big ass rings and chains 
 (Chuch) 
 Big trucks sittin' on thangs 
 (Chuch) 
 Diamonds and jewels 
 (Chuch) 
 Shining down on you fools is 
 (Chuch) 
 Rhyming the way I do that's 
 (Chuch) 
 Blindin' 'em when I come through 
 (Chuch) 
 Bling, bling that's right, everything Da Brat-tat-tat do 
 You could identify that as church, not church 
 That don't mean to da flo, that's church 
 When you got the muthafucking hat to match 
 Nigga, that's church 
 If you see me when I come around 
 (That's church) 
 Breakin' all these hoes down 
 (That's church) 
 Got the Cadillacs and Bentleys 
 (That's church) 
 Got money to the ceiling, y'all 
 (That's church) 
 Everywhere I go they scream 
 (That's church) 
 Everybody, say it now 
 If you see me when I come around 
 (That's church) 
 Breakin' all these hoes down 
 (That's church) 
 Got the Cadillacs and Bentleys 
 (That's church) 
 Got money to the ceiling, y'all 
 (That's church) 
 Everywhere I go they scream 
 (That's church) 
 Everybody, say it now 
 (That's church)
