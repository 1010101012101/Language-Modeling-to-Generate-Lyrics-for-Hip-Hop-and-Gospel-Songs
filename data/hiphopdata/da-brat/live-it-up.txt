Nine six, it's Da Brat nigga 
 We jackin these niggas for they beats and shit 
 YaknowwhatI'msayin 
 Put this shit in ya mothafuckin mouth... 
 Niggas know when they see the afro sym-boool they embrace themselves 
 Lock doors and hold their breath 
 For the black on black beamer drivin' 
 Shitin on niggas time after time 
 And on da west side is confinement 
 It ain't no gettin' outta line with me I stays ready 
 Split a mothafuckas shit fo free if necessary 
 Gotta love for gettin' blunted 
 What you wanna do I done it... bitch 
 And about to do it again 
 So run and tell ya friends I'm comin' 
 Chorus: repeat 2X
