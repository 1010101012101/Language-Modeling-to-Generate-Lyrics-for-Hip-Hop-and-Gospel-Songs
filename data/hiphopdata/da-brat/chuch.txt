If you see me when I come around 
 (that's chuch) 
 Breakin' all these hoes down 
 (that's chuch) 
 Got Cadillacs and Bentleys, ahh 
 (that's chuch) 
 Got money to the ceiling ya'll 
 (that's chuch) 
 Everywhere I go they scream 
 (that's chuch) 
 Everybody say it now 
 (that's chuch) 
 I come through stompin' in my big black boots 
 I keep 'em jumpin' jumpin', stayin' funky funky for you 
 whether Prada, Gucci, Versace, my coochie draped in La Pera 
 Got watches like Liberace, from my head to my stockings 
 I promise to rock this and keep it poppin' 
 Ain't no stoppin me, naw 
 'Cause im on fire like a cigarette 
 Get higher when the beat quick nigga we hit 
 Shittin' on niggas to heeze on 'em just to eat quick 
 Recently, I've been eliminating haters hypocrites 
 When they see on the street with the screaming whip 
 It's hard to not hate, so don't even trip, 'cause I'm chuch 
 If you see me when I come around 
 (that's chuch) 
 Breakin' all these hoes down 
 (that's chuch) 
 Got Cadillacs and Bentleys, ahh 
 (that's chuch) 
 Got money to the ceiling ya'll 
 (that's chuch) 
 Everywhere I go they scream 
 (that's chuch) 
 Everybody say it now 
 (that's chuch) 
 I'm chuch, I'm smokin, I'm sharp, I'm hot 
 I'm sexy, I'm bangin, I'm sickening, I rock 
 I'm the hottest, a hard act to follow 
 Never bite off more than I can chew up and swallow 
 If you got a problem, holla at me tomorrow 
 'Cause I'm too busy bein' the leader you follow 
 Nigga I'm cold blooded in a mustard color Ferrari, somebody sure love me 
 I hope a nigga won't come out ugly shit, I ain't buyin 'em,.that's chuch 
 Whatever work for you, I'm so tough that I just lay all my coo 
 I'm so much that I only give a little to you 
 And show you how these niggas up in Chi-town do 
 If you see me when I come around 
 (that's chuch) 
 Breakin' all these hoes down 
 (that's chuch) 
 Got Cadillacs and Bentleys, ahh 
 (that's chuch) 
 Got money to the ceiling ya'll 
 (that's chuch) 
 Everywhere I go they scream 
 (that's chuch) 
 Everybody say it now 
 (that's chuch) 
 Like Caddies and furs 
 (chuch) 
 House in the suburbs 
 (chuch) 
 Big ass rings and chains 
 (chuch) 
 Big trucks sittin on thangs 
 (chuch) 
 Diamonds and jewels 
 (chuch) 
 Shining down on you fools is 
 (chuch) 
 Rhyming the way I do, that's 
 (chuch) 
 Blinding 'em when I come through 
 (chuch) 
 Bling, bling, that's right 
 Everything Da Brat-tat-tat do, you could identify that as chuch, not church 
 That don't mean to da flo, that's chuch 
 When you got the muthafucking hat to match, nigga, that's chuch 
 That's that Chi-town shit 
 If you see me when I come around 
 (that's chuch) 
 Breakin' all these hoes down

 Everybody say it now
