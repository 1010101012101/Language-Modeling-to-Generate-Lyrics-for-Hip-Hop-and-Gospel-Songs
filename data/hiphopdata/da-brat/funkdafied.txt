Hot times in the funk! 
 Yeah, so funkdafied 
 So, let's take a ride 
 With Da Brat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat on that ass 
 So-oh, so-oh, so-oh funkdafied 
 So-oh, so-oh, so-oh funkdafied 
 Open up, open up and let the funk flow in 
 From this nigga named J and his new found friend 
 I'm hittin switches like Eric on the solo creep 
 Fo yo Jeep it's Da B-R-A-T 
 Puttin a dip in yo hip from right to left 
 It's that ghetto ass bitch and I'm So So Def 
 Nigga that's my clique 
 Nigga that's who I rolls with 
 And we kicks nothing but the fat shit 
 Them calls me the funkafied, funkalistic, vocalistic 
 With the real shit 
 We got the shit you can't fuck wit 
 (Why?) because we so funkdafied 
 (Why?) we make you move from side to side 
 Well it's the G-H the E-T-T-O nigga 
 Brat and J.D. comin like that big baby 
 So, lay back and listen as I catch up on my pimpin 
 And freak this duet just like Ashford and Simpson 
 'Cause I'm 
 So-oh, so-oh, so-oh funkdafied 
 So-oh, so-oh, so-oh funkdafied 
 So-oh, so-oh, so-oh funkdafied 
 So-oh, so-oh, so-oh funkdafied 
 Puttin it down, puttin it down ain't no thang to me 
 And ain't too many hoes that can hang with me 
 It's like that and as a matter a fact 
 When it comes to Da Brat 
 I got the shit that make yo neck snap back 
 Meanin I got the shit that'll get you bent 
 Tearin the roof off this mutha like Parliament 
 I'm on a roll, in control, like Janet, dammit 
 Brat, yo the funk bandit and they can't handle it 
 I know 
 That's why I keep hittin em wit this grammar 
 Lettin niggas know that I'm the real Mama Jama 
 Word to Da Brat 
 Straight to the head like a chronic sack 
 I passed the mic to Da Brat 
 Hey yo, I passed it back 
 Well-a sistas and fellas it's time to get your groove on 
 I provide the funkafied sounds to make you move, homes 
 Breakin these fools off proper like 
 It's S-o S-o D-e-f dynamite 
 Huminah huminah comin up at ya like Ralph K. 
 And since this ain't no honeymoon I'm here to stay 
 And the way we're comin at ya, baby we can't miss 
 There's a new tag team in town 
 Nigga, woop there it is 
 So-oh, so-oh, so-oh funkdafied 
 So-oh, so-oh, so-oh funkdafied 
 So-oh, so-oh, so-oh funkdafied 
 So-oh, so-oh, so-oh funkdafied
