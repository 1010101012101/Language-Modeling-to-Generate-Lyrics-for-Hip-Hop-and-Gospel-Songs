Shit, I let my guard down 
 Damn, I let your ass in when I should've kept you out 
 It's all gravy it happens to all of us 
 When you hurt, you hurt back 
 You reap what you sow 
 In the beginning when I met you 
 Didn't mean to be rude but 
 I had to sweat you 'cause you had me wet boo 
 I couldn't let you get away 
 'Cause then when would I see you again, another day? 
 Your face was all I needed to see on a daily basis 
 My heart in your hands would make it all gravy 
 But I was mistaken highly 
 You slid shit right by me 
 Being deceitful and hiding, keeping secrets 
 But still keeping me smiling iviting hoes to your party 
 Lord knows I don't wanna get started 
 I might hurt somebody 
 Regardless I'ma love you for what we been through 
 But keeping you is something I can't do 
 If you get somebody 
 Not just anybody 
 Get somebody 
 That's gonna be like nobody 
 Get somebody 
 Don't tell everybody 
 'Cause somebody gon' try to crash your party 
 If you get somebody 
 Not just anybody 
 Get somebody 
 That's gonna be like nobody 
 Get somebody 
 Don't tell everybody 
 'Cause somebody gon' try to crash your party 
 As much as I miss you I can't get with you 
 We painted a perfect picture 
 But I can see clearly now the rain is gone 
 But the pain still come on strong 
 Every so often I get discombobulated 
 Calling Miss Cleo to see what the Tarot Cards are saying 
 Hoping that she know how to help a bitch out or something 
 Give me your lucky number 
 Then come up those motherfuckers I'm not fronting 
 You only get one strike here 
 You blew it so I won't be right here 
 The best friend that you claim you ever had is gone 
 And it happened because you played me wrong 
 Sing that song for me 
 If you get somebody 
 Not just anybody 
 Get somebody 
 That's gonna be like nobody 
 Get somebody 
 Don't tell everybody 
 'Cause somebody gon' try to crash your party 
 And now that it's over that 
 Predicament taught me to be 
 A soldier and stay at attention 
 Fold my collar up and pop it 
 And keep hollering at the rich niggas 
 With tha deep pockets that keep me going shopping 
 I'm better now than ever now 
 You've never found somebody quite like me to stay down 
 Whatever is meant to be I'll be that 
 And whoever is sent to me will be crashed 
 If you get somebody 
 Not just anybody 
 Get somebody 
 That's gonna be like nobody 
 Get somebody 
 Don't tell everybody 
 'Cause somebody gon' try to crash your party 
 Check it out, no matter what you do 
 You can't let 'em crash your party 
 Get you somebody that's gonna 
 Lad-dee-da-dee that came to party
