So so def 
 Hey shortie 
 How we do 
 Hey shorite 
 I'm all about that paper dough 
 Can you see me 
 You know yeah 
 As the clock keep ticking tick, tick gotta keep my vision bleary, 
 I'm in a hurry to get this paper don't worry I'm a dough chaser I'm 
 Still living my dreams wheather its hustling, shaking and shuffling niggas around I'm getting more greater and it's the gang shit that I ain't seen yet 
 And it's the gang niggas I ain't meet yet 
 Even though I been to paris and london and rome, Japan, Africa, bagdad amesterdam brought back a phat sack 
 And I'm rolling dem joints chrome flashing sparkling like gucci colins when I throw on that boostey 
 You niggas can't stop slobbing I'm a pretty young thug and its hotter than ever 
 Fucking it up so I get paid to do stuff never when this cheddar at stake 
 I'm a chain billionaire blow a couple of million some cars so my family and homies can ride like stars 
 I'm all about the money I don't know about you I got places I wanna go and things I wanna do gotta whole lotta living to do be4 I die and I ain't got time to waste 
 Honey yeah yeah 
 Now understand me 'cause it's not complex I'm yung and resteless with one life to 
 Live so I cash cheques 
 I'm individually wrapped liked a fresh twinke so if I cream in the middle 
 Nigga licky, licky, licky licky become sponge bob absorb me up 
 Can't just polish this I demolish the flow niggaz astonished when I spit when I'm pissed I let it flow I can afford me a bentley without having to forge a signature or getting a nigga to co sign with me 
 I get bored quickly so I saw on the g4 to cali for more sticky gravey life 
 Come hop on this tour with me let's get faded for life 
 I used to save up cookies they are brown even 
 But I got rid of the whole box and I didn't even turn the loot in' I'm shootin'it's all cause of you lame ass butlers when I smirk if devils could talk mine would say fuck ya! 
 It's so so def 
 How could the cans get droped 
 From the mansion to the high rise to the block we hot 
 I rock the white people the latinos and forgeiners 
 Niggas can't see me when they cry I scratch out there corniers 
 I'm warning ya I was born a winner I scarecrowed off like that anna lotono 
 Did right after she sang 'home in the weares' after the blizard that's when I came through with them frosted pieces was dripping like icicles 
 Keep a few of dem precious VDSS next to my skin so with the best investment jems ain't no second guessing its here 
 Ain't not question who the best is take a lesson from a bitch who is the goodie in years 
 Never skooted in here got dem all in here 
 Cause dirty money spin like clean money from da ATM dummy so when you done bummping your gumms there's a lot of dough to be made 
 You should get you sum before it's too late 
 And you left wiv none 
 Now it's all 'bout the cash where ever it come from 
 Nigga 
 Honey if you hear me
