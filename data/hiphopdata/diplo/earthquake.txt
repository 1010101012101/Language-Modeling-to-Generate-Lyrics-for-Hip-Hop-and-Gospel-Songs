My flow drops like an earthquake earthquake, earthquake, 
 Earthquake, earthquake, earthquake 
 I make that ass shake, ass shake, ass shake, 
 Ass shake, ass shake, ass shake, ass shake 
 It's time to deveastate, devastate, deveastate, 
 Devastate, deveastate, devastate 
 I'll male the glass break, glass break, glass break, 
 Break, break, break, break 
 Drop like an earthquake 
 My flow harder than a bitch fucking good dope 
 These hoes hating why these hoes so cut throat 
 One hit wonder bitch, I make that shit pop 
 He told me to go in, fresh, I pop that shit 
 My flow shake harder than Alaska quake 
 The one in 1964, it was devastate 
 These bitches wonder who I is, tell them shake 'n' bake 
 Ricky Bobb, y bitch I'm nobody 
 Shake that ass on the floor, let me see you wobble it 
 Tell them to burn my shit when you hit that replay girl, 
 Smokin' while I'm riding 
 Bitch nigga hiding 
 Do these shit like every day, drop like an earthquake 
 DJ Fresh where Diplo at? 
 Hey Diplo I see you baby (Ugh) 
 It'll make the ground shake, ground shake, 
 Ground shake, ground shake, ground shake, ground shake, ground shake 
 Play my shit hit the replay, replay, replay, 
 Replay, replay, replay, replay 
 It will never hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, 
 Hesitate, hesitate, hesitate, hesitate 
 It'll make the glass break, glass break, 
 Glass break, break, break, break, break 
 Drop like an earthquake 
 Drop like an earthquake
