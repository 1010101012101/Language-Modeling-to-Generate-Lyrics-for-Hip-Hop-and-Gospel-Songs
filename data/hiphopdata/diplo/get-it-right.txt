I am walking down that road 
 Where did all the flowers go? 
 They say we're supposed to grow 
 Learning from the highs and lows 
 All eyes lying on me oh, 
 Begging me to play the role 
 'Cause I'm gonna get it right 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 They can try to hold me down but I am 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 When the sky is filled with smoke and fire 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 All I want is something better in the purple light 
 They can try to hold me down but I am 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 All my dreams are running wild 
 I am gonna chase them down 
 They said you gonna' lose your mind 
 Hurry up you're out of time 
 I say I will rise and shine 
 Even in the coldest night 
 'Cause I'm gonna get it right 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 They can try to hold me down but I am 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 When the sky is filled with smoke and fire 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 All I want is something better in the purple light 
 They can try to hold me down but I am 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 I'm gonna get it right 
 I'm gonna get it right
