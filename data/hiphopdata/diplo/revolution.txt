Can you see it? 
 The worst is over 
 The monsters in my head are scared of love 
 Fallen people 
 Listen up! 
 It's never too late to change our luck 
 So, don't let them steal your light 
 Eh, eh, eh, eh 
 Don't let them break your stride 
 There is light on the other side 
 And you'll see all the raindrops falling behind 
 It's a revolution 
 Make it out tonight 
 It's a revolution 
 It's a reva, rev 
 Can you see it? 
 The worst is over 
 The monsters in my head are scared of love 
 Fallen people 
 Listen up! 
 It's never too late to change our luck 
 So, don't let them steal your light 
 Eh, eh, eh, eh 
 Don't let them break your stride 
 Eh, eh, eh, eh 
 There is light on the other side 
 And you'll all the raindrops falling behind 
 It's a revolution 
 Make it out tonight 
 It's a revolution 
 It's a reva, rev 
 Oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh oh 
 Oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh oh 
 Oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh oh 
 Oh oh, ooh oh, oh oh oh 
 Rev, rev, rev, rev
