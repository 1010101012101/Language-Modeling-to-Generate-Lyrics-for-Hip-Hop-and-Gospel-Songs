My face shining, looking like some salmon skin 
 All twelve Reggie Hammond, holding hammers him 
 Never speak, he like that short silent type 
 I'm in the mountains shovin' knives, drinking wine at night 
 Rose petals get thrown to the feet 
 Know we grow knee 'cause even in this rap don't work we got stones in the street 
 Go down in Tallahassee, work and come home in a week 
 See me stoned in a Jeep with the chrome on the feet 
 Leather overalls, shirtless like I'm Kells in the street 
 Posing for flicks, leaning on an English whip 
 With the float ware straight from the aquarium 
 My bitch built like secretariat, yeah, bring the chariot 
 I fuck the pussy, not marry it, world on my shoulders, dougie, I carry it 
 I'm more than happy with my bitch, she got no saggy tits 
 I'll do it old school style and give her baggy dick 
 Rock, rock, very 
 Slow, slow, steady 
 Base, base, heavy 
 Drum, drums, ready 
 They talk in cents, diamonds in our tooths and dinner (ice) 
 Rap game Burt Reynolds in a candy canteloupe car rental 
 I'm in the trash compactor, black shades like famous actor 
 Bank account doin' gymnastics, flip 
 40 cal. in the Razorback starter jacket (Arkansas) 
 I switch up like south paw, frozen teeth look like tiger claws 
 Look like a pain to massage my upper bums and lower jowls (igloos) 
 My wedding gifts consists of Versace blend, ice out contenders, didn't mean to offend you 
 When I pull up the (?), in the candy leather (?) 
 Flush out the system with niacin, 40 lines of the Vicodin 
 Still childish and violent, with appetite for violins 
 Disappearing act like Sister, Sister 
 Lost the biscuits, city slickers, rap game Billy Crystal 
 Pass our nuts, shit, ain't no courtesy flush 
 Fuck black bitches till they bruise, white hoes till they flush 
 Fuck pretty bitches in their face, dick holes in their butts 
 Bumping mace (?) 
 (?) Sipping more lean with Goldie 
 Sweaty minks in the summer like it's snowing 
 Pummel all opponents turn gold if I concentrate 
 Scrape the plate rap for my team, bought a cheese greater 
 Eggplant, Parmesan with (?) seen him do a pushup on the back of his head 
 Acting like I'm certified, niggas get nervous when I'm walking 
 Nudge each other and whisper that's him 
 Y'all niggas, cooch, pussies 
 I'mma cool off his noose on the loose sipping hooch 
 Flow's out the colon, TYB chosen, bust it wide open with my staff like Moses 
 Motherfucker 
 Bounce to the left, shake it to the right 
 Now pop it up once, we gon' dance tonight
