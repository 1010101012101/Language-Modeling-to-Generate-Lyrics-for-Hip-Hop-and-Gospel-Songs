No one's like you. I hardly understand the things that you do 
 The way you think is such a mystery to me, help me to see your point 
 (But) I cannot live without the troubles and the pains that you give 
 And though I'm shakin' I still want you to stay don't go away 
 My girl 
 Please make it hard for me 
 Don't like the easy way 
 Oh won't you menace me 
 Till I feel sorry for myself 
 I need to feel your presence next to me 
 I have to conceal the things you say to me 
 To see what I've got I turn around and face the other side 
 And now that I've seen your knockin' point of view 
 I'm stuck in between the flaws of my conception 
 What a disgrace truth fades away from me 
 Please make it hard for me 
 Don't like the easy way 
 Oh won't you menace me 
 Till I feel sorry for myself 
 Please make it hard for me 
 Don't like the easy way 
 Oh won't you menace me 
 Till I feel sorry for myself 
 Myself 
 Oh for myself 
 Please make it hard for me 
 Don't like the easy way 
 Oh won't you menace me 
 Till I feel sorry for myself 
 Please make it hard for me 
 Don't like the easy way 
 Oh won't you menace me 
 Till I feel sorry for myself 
 Myself 
 Myself 
 Myself
