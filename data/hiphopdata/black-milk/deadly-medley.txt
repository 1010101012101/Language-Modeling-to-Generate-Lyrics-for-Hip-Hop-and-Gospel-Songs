Truth be told 
 This is who you call the truest out the newest foe 
 To people watchin' our every move like it's the Truman Show 
 Coolest flow 
 Signal to my crew the "Cue to go" 
 With they finger on triggers, gun powder under cuticles 
 Newest flow 
 Shows 
 As ugly as war zones 
 Yeah, shit is ugly as Lady Gaga's wardrobe 
 Word to Dilla 
 His verse is illa 
 The words are killa 
 Ain't heard nothing this Legendary out since the birth of Thriller 
 My human nature's to expose teams 
 Seems 
 These rappin' niggas are girls, pre-teen 
 Billie Jean 
 Seems 
 They love when I'm performin' 
 They laugh at your performance 
 My shit is Martin Luther, your shit is Martin Lawrence 
 Tourin' on the plane to somewhere in the world new 
 In the clouds, listenin' to Stevie Wonder's "Girl Blue" 
 So true 
 Dude is feelin' confident and feelin' taller 
 I'm feelin' on top of the world without the fear of fallin' 
 I said niggas known to talk a lot get chopped up 
 I say I'm sittin' in the coffee shop, 
 I don't mean I'm at no StarBucks 
 Just me and Vicious 
 Rollin' round like we don't need no niggas 
 Just these triggers 
 We old school like Dean Pritchard 
 You can't take the heat, get yo ass out the kitchen 
 Matter fact, take yo ass back in there and wash the dishes 
 I'm ready for war 
 I know what you thinkin' I already said it before 
 You better get ready for this 
 Deadly Medley, whenever we here to record 
 I can cut into you in my sleep 
 Like steppin' to the weak 
 I can catch a bullet in my teeth 
 I'm known as 
 Who not to go at 
 Don't ask, just never tempt me 
 You can bet your ass 
 You have no ass, you bet against me 
 (Uh) I'm in the best shape of my life lyrically 
 I don't even write seriously 
 I just fuck around 
 Like the Rolling Stone 
 I lay the hat in many homes 
 Bad Boy like Diddy Combs 
 Shoulders which his whole entire city on 
 (Yo) You need to be amputated 
 I snap you in minutes 
 I left Detroit rappers in fitteds decapitated 
 This not a dumb threat 
 Cause though I'm not what I become yet 
 I challenge some vet 
 And stick it to him like a drum set 
 Clap the matic 
 I flip like an acrobatic 
 Slap fanatics 
 With murderous rap mechanics 
 I'm worth pay 
 Pockets go green like it was Earth Day 
 That's why I blow cake like it's my birthday 
 The way I roll and vision the city blob 
 Half of y'all shouldn't rap, y'all do a shitty job 
 Like colon cleansin' 
 And I'm dying to test ya 
 No denyin' 
 I'm applyin' 
 The pressure 
 Like the iron 
 I rely on 
 That lie in the dresser 
 Several try and get they Kangol crushed 
 Cause my skills ill, like slicin' up devils pie off of angel dust 
 You left behind me lookin' shadowy 
 Fatality 
 Don't ever try to handle me 
 Like a piano key
