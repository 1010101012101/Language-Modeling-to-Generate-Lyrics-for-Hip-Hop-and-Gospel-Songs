The sickman's in my room 
 He has rendered me asleep 
 Spread his lungs across my bed 
 Now I'm doin' time 
 The sickman's in my mind 
 Robs the days I pray to keep 
 And every breath I take is cold 
 I'm set ultrawide apart 
 Way beyond the frame 
 Caught in a leakin' story 
 Ultrawide apart from me 
 Watch the dirt beneath my feet 
 As it's creepin' up 
 It leaves me unresolved 
 Am I fallin' off the track? 
 Whatsoever I have fought off 
 Has now become my life 
 Has now become my life ... 
 I'm set ultrawide apart 
 Way beyond the frame 
 Caught in a leakin' story 
 Ultrawide apart from me 
 From what you think I am 
 Caught in a leakin' story 
 Ultrawide apart from me 
 From what you think I am 
 I'm caught in a leakin' story 
 Ultrawide apart 
 I'm ultrawide apart 
 I'm set ultrawide apart 
 From what you think I am 
 Caught in a leakin' story 
 Ultrawide apart from me
