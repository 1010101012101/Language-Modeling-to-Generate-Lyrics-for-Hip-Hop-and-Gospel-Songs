Would you believe in any word I say 
 I wouldn't mind but somehow I got 
 Lost along my way 
 The borders you seek are what I left behind 
 All I can see is just an 
 Apparition to the blind 
 You may not know me 
 But I keep your hand in mine 
 For what you show me 
 And sometime 
 You may find 
 Why I'm here 
 And there's nothing I can give 
 But the simple fact I live 
 Why I'm here 
 If I cast the days away 
 I've got nothing to explain 
 But maybe I'll ease your pain 
 That's why I'm here 
 Would you believe in any vow I make 
 I wouldn't mind but you'll find 
 It's more than you can take 
 I know that you're lost but I won't interfere 
 Maybe someday you'll discover 
 Where to go from here 
 You may not know me 
 But I keep your hand in mine 
 For what you show me 
 And sometime 
 You may find 
 Why I'm here 
 And there's nothing I can give 
 But the simple fact I live 
 Why I'm here 
 If I cast the days away 
 I've got nothing to explain 
 But maybe I'll ease your pain 
 That's why I'm here 
 Why I'm here 
 And there's nothing I can give 
 But the simple fact I live 
 Why I'm here 
 If I cast the days away 
 I've got nothing to explain 
 Colder than the rain 
 I'm colder than the rain 
 And I wash away the stains 
 I will wash away the stains
