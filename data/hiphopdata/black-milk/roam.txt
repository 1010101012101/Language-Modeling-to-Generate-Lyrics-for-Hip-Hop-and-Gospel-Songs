I don't know how it came to be but now it's right here 
 And I believe that I can't make it go away 
 I can't start again so ... 
 This shame becomes a part of me 
 And once again it's plain to see 
 I will roam just as long somebody will forgive 
 This entropy that follows me 
 I beg you bless this dark load 
 When it's too late to change events and I start to grieve and I realize 
 There is nothing left to do now 
 I can't start again so ... 
 The blackbooks consequence is due 
 And once again I can see through ... 
 I will roam just as long somebody will forgive 
 This entropy that follows me 
 I beg you bless this dark load 
 When I rise to penetrate the iron sky - this time I've gone too far 
 And I try to see the world through everybody's eyes 
 Everybody's eyes ... 
 I will roam just as long somebody will forgive 
 This entropy that follows me 
 I beg you bless this dark load 
 I will roam and struggle on my own till someone will forgive 
 This entropy that follows me 
 I beg you bless this dark load
