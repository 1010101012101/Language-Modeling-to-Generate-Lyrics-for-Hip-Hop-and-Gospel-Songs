The knowledge of my fathers is written in my books 
 The wisdom of the preachers on my TV 
 Another so called genius telling me what to do now 
 How to be, how to be successful ... 
 And maybe I'm stupid 
 And they are gods indeed 
 And maybe I'm naive 
 Somehow I believe 
 For me this is just a testflight 
 Just to gain an insight 
 This is just a checkin' out, a wonder why 
 For me this is just a trialrun 
 Just a random testing 
 And please don't meddle in, 
 This prototype is mine 
 Everyone is so much wiser 
 And everyone knows so much more 
 Everyone knows many answers to solve the problems in my life 
 Everyone will tell me to rely on what he wants me to 
 And everyone will steal my sight telling me: use my eyes instead! 
 And maybe I'm stupid 
 And they are gods indeed 
 And maybe I'm naive 
 Somehow I believe 
 For me this is just a testflight 
 Just to gain an insight 
 This is just a checkin' out, a wonder why 
 For me this is just a trialrun 
 Just a random testing 
 And please don't meddle in, 
 This prototype is mine 
 Mine 
 For me this is just a testflight 
 Just to gain an insight 
 This is just a checkin' out, a wonder why 
 For me this is just a trialrun 
 Just a random testing 
 And please don't meddle in, 
 This prototype is mine 
 Is mine
