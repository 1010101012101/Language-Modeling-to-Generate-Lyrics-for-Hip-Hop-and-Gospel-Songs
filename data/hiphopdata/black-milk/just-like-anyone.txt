I have never been that way 
 The shape I'm in was turning grey 
 But I was proud to fool me 
 The truth is hiding in my lies 
 The sparks I lit and sacrificed 
 Are gone and keep their secret 
 So if you want to know me 
 I change my name 
 But it's just the same 
 I'm like anyone 
 Falling on the run 
 So if it's far too late 
 To turn the twist of fate 
 To burn the cards I played 
 Faking just like anyone 
 It's all the same 
 Though the hunger still remains 
 I'm out here just like anyone 
 And anyone is me 
 The walls I crashed fell down on me 
 Still I feel I should believe 
 That it's all right with you 
 I see your face but I can't speak 
 Embrace your arm but I'm too weak 
 To hold you by my side ... 
 So if you want to know me 
 I change my name 
 But it's just the same 
 I'm like anyone 
 Falling on the run 
 So if it's far too late 
 To turn the twist of fate 
 To burn the cards I played 
 Faking just like anyone 
 It's all the same 
 Though the hunger still remains 
 I'm out here just like anyone 
 And anyone is me 
 So am I slowly but I never trained 
 Though I know that I'm too blame 
 It's just a matter stupid wise 
 In another rhyme that hurts 
 And now like anyone 
 So if it's far too late 
 To turn the twist of fate 
 To burn the cards I played 
 Faking just like anyone 
 It's all the same 
 Though the hunger still remains 
 I'm out here just like anyone 
 And anyone is me 
 Too late 
 To turn the twist of fate 
 To burn the cards I played 
 Faking just like anyone 
 It's all the same 
 But the hunger still remains 
 I'm out here just like anyone 
 And anyone is me
