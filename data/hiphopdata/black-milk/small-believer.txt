What am I 
 I'm sitting in an armchair, humming 
 Silent prayers again 
 What am I 
 I'm spilling soda water 
 For the whisper of a name 
 Unspoken words 
 Penetrate the light 
 Broken birds 
 Prepare to fly 
 I am still a small believer 
 I am just the wall beneath you 
 Won't you have a try 
 And tear it down 
 What am I 
 I'm searching for the shadows you have 
 Left for me to find 
 What am I 
 I'm dancing 'rond in circles 
 In the corner of my mind 
 The moment will conceal 
 There's nothing to be said 
 All I've ever been 
 Will fall in shreds 
 I am still a small believer 
 I am just the wall beneath you 
 Won't you have a try 
 And tear it down 
 Hear me I'm the voice that calls you 
 And I crawl and rise and fall to 
 Find a way so you 
 Could tear it down 
 Who am I to love 
 Who am I to feel 
 Who am I to judge 
 Whatever you may be 
 Who am I to claim 
 I could be the one 
 The one 
 I am still a small believer 
 I am just the wall beneath you 
 Won't you have a try 
 And tear it down 
 Hear me I'm the voice that calls you 
 And I crawl and rise and fall to 
 Find a way so you 
 Could tear it down 
 Down 
 Tear it down 
 Tear it down
