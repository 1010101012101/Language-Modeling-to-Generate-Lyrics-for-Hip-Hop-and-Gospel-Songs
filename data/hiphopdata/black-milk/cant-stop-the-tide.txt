Somehow the atmosphere has changed 
 Feel it's time to rearrange - 
 The flood is coming in ... 
 Please say none of your dreams will subside, 
 Promise you'll be by my side 
 When the breakers come to crush 
 So rest, yield what's left behind 
 The movements of your mind can never change your fate 
 ('Cause) we can't stop the tide as it's bringin' in our dykes, 
 Time is running through our hands like grains of sand 
 We're slowly gettin' old, 
 Can't stop the tide 
 Now that the grapes of wrath are here 
 Though you tell me: have no fear 
 When the breakers come to crush 
 Please save one of your fleeting smiles for me 
 Make believe you will be here 
 When the flood is coming in 
 We live, live until we're worn, try to be as one 
 But how can we succeed? 
 ('Cause) we can't stop the tide as it's bringin' in our dykes, 
 Time is running through our hands like grains of sand 
 We're slowly gettin' old, 
 Can't stop the tide as it's bringin' in our dykes, 
 Time is running through our hands like grains of sand 
 We're slowly gettin' old, 
 (And that's why ...) 
 I welcome the naught to hollow out my derelict eyes 
 I'm fading away so 
 I won't be around 
 ('Cause) we can't stop the tide as it's bringin' in our dykes, 
 Time is running through our hands like grains of sand 
 We're slowly gettin' old, 
 Can't stop the tideas it's bringin' in our dykes, 
 Time is running through our hands like grains of sand 
 We're slowly gettin' old, 
 Can't stop the tide
