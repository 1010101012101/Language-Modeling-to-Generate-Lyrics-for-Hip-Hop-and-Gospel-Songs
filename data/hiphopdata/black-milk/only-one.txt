Forgive the world today 
 Let your fears hide away 
 The debts you still got to pay 
 Belong to the earth 
 Of ten thousand sinners 
 If something's left to be said 
 When wine has soaked in your bread 
 When dreams have conquered your heart 
 Whisper the rhyme of ten thousand sinners 
 Care for me my lonely one 
 I dare to say you're the only one 
 To gather the dreams 
 I need to believe in 
 You are the only one 
 If you believe what you've seen 
 If you forget who you've been 
 The tears you lost in your dreams 
 Will water the realm of ten thousand sinners 
 Care for me my lonely one 
 I dare to say you're the only one 
 To gather the dreams 
 I need to believe in 
 You are the only one 
 Please don't leave the world today 
 Still something's left upon your way 
 The cross that you bear 
 Will shine on my prayer 
 You are the only one 
 So good to see you again 
 I follow you and your nameless heir 
 We'll get anywhere 
 On the path of ten thousand sinners 
 Care for me my lonely one 
 I dare to say you're the only one 
 To gather the dreams 
 I need to believe in 
 You are the only one 
 Please don't leave the world today 
 Still something's left upon your way 
 The cross that you bear 
 Will shine on my prayer 
 You are the only one 
 Care for me my lonely one 
 I dare to say you're the only one 
 To gather the dreams 
 I need to believe in 
 You are the only one
