Every day I see, there's something new to me 
 Things always change that's a fact of life 
 You can never wake up to the same day twice 
 Every way I see, something new feels good to me 
 I could stay, I could go, I could just take flight 
 You'll never wake up to the same day twice 
 Trying to find myself today, sometimes life gets in the way 
 All I'm looking for is some peace of mind 
 Was quiet, now it's too loud, suns up, then storms a cloud 
 Sometimes I wish things would stay the same 
 In this world that's always changing 
 Every day I see, there's something new to me 
 Things always change that's a fact of life 
 You can never wake up to the same day twice 
 Every way I see, something new feels good to me 
 I could stay, I could go, I could just take flight 
 You'll never wake up to the same day twice 
 I'm getting sick of this old scene 
 You and me it's the same routine 
 'Cause forever is only a state of mind 
 'Cause you're preoccupied, I think it's justified 
 That I can't help think about someone new 
 We were scared to open our eyes 
 Every day I see, there's something new to me 
 Things always change that's a fact of life 
 You can never wake up to the same day twice 
 Every way I see, something new feels good to me 
 I could stay, I could go, I could just take flight 
 You'll never wake up to the same day twice 
 If yesterday was repeated today 
 Would the choices you made still have been okay 
 Would the grass be just as green 
 Would you say what you said although it was mean 
 And tell me, would you have tried a little harder 
 So I could have been with someone smarter? 
 If you ran in that race, would you still come in last? 
 Would you let time have past you by so fast? 
 Every day I see, there's something new to me 
 Things always change that's a fact of life 
 You can never wake up to the same day twice 
 Every way I see, something new feels good to me 
 I could stay, I could go, I could just take flight 
 You'll never wake up to the same day twice 
 Everything I see's something new to me 
 You can never wake up to the same day twice
