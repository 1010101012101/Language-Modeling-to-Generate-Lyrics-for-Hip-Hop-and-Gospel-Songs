Lock eyes from across the room 
 Down my drink while the rhythms boom 
 Take your hand and skip the names 
 No need here for the silly games 
 Make our way through the smoke and crowd 
 The club is the sky and I'm on your cloud 
 Move in close as the lasers fly 
 Our bodies touch and the angels cry 
 Leave this place lets go back to yours 
 Our lips first touch outside your doors 
 The whole night what we got in store 
 Whisper in my ear that you want some more 
 And I jizz in my pants 
 This really never happens you can take my word 
 I want to apologize that's just absurd 
 Mainly I fall for the way you dance 
 And now I jizz in my pants 
 Don't tell your friends or ill say you're a slut 
 Plus it's your fault you were rubbing my butt 
 I'm very sensitive some would say that's a plus 
 Now I'll go home and change 
 I need a few things from the grocery 
 Do things alone now mostly 
 Left me heart broken not looking for love 
 Surprise in my eyes when I look above 
 This check-out counter and I saw her face 
 My heart stood still so did time and space 
 Never thought I could feel real again 
 But the look in her eye said I need a friend 
 She turned to me that's when she said it 
 Looked me dead in the face asked cash or credit 
 And I jizzed in my pants 
 Its perfectly normal nothing wrong with me 
 But we are gonna need a clean up on aisle 3 
 And now I am posed in an awkward stance 
 Because I jizzed in my pants 
 To be fair you were flirting a lot 
 Plus the way you bag cans got me bothered and hot 
 Please stop acting like your not impressed 
 1 more thing I'm gonna pay by check 
 Last week I saw a flim 
 As I recall it was a horror film 
 Walked outside into the rain 
 Checked my phone and saw you rang 
 And I jizzed in my pants 
 Speeding down the street when the red lights flash 
 Need to get away need to make a dash 
 A song comes on that reminds me of you 
 And I jizz in my pants 
 The next day my alarm goes off 
 And I jizz in my pants 
 Open my window and a breeze rolls in 
 And I jizz in my pants 
 When bruce willis was dead at the end of sixth sense 
 I jizzed in my pants 
 I just ate a grape 
 And I jizzed in my pants 
 I went 
 Jizzed in my pants 
 Ok seriously you guys can we ok? 
 I jizz right in my pants every time your next to me 
 And when were holding hands it's like having sex to me 
 You say I am premature I just call it ecstasy 
 I wear a rubber at all times it's a necessity 
 'Cause I jizz in my pants 
 Yes I jizz in my pants
