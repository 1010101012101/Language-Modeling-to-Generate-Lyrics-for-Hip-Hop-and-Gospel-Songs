Jezey Mob Shit (Outlawz), 
 What fuck wit this, 
 One Nation, One Thug 
 Raised as 1 
 One Time, One Motherfucker 
 (Verse 1:Young Noble) 
 Aye yo... 
 We all moved together 
 Went to schook together 
 Hold tools whenever 
 Cool as ever 
 Nast-New forever 
 I choose the chedder 
 Fuck these hoes 
 Don't fuck with Nobe 
 I'm touchin' souls 
 So fuck parole 
 These muthafuckas better slow they roll 
 Cause you can be touched 
 Any given day you can be stucked 
 Walkin' down the block mindin' ya biz 
 No time for a bid 
 Going wrong but got no time for a kid 
 That nigga Nobe gettin' down for his 
 'Cause it's trippin' on a late night 
 Count ya wish 
 Picture me thuggin' on the block with clips 
 Numb till I see the sun tryna knock off nicks 
 My "Lil D" -- see he feelin' the same 
 Aww hell Outlaw Recordz 
 We killin' the game 
 The homey Pac told me drill 'em with pain 
 The homey Yak said spit at 'em with critical game 
 Shit is the same 
 Niggaz ain't changed since eighty-nine 
 Many heads on the block 
 But I made me mines 
 A crazy time -- we livin' for this 
 Don't nobody else care 
 So we ain't giving a shit 
 (Chorus:Young Noble) 
 Why snitches die old 
 And souljahs die young 
 We all born in the slum 
 Don't be playin' with gunz 
 Lil niggaz on the run 
 Better Dayz'll come 
 Young thugs all raised as 1 
 Where we at? 
 Why snitches die old 
 And souljahs die young 
 We all born in the slum 
 Don't be playin' with gunz 
 Lil niggaz on the run 
 Better Dayz'll come 
 Young thugs all raised as 1 
 (Raised as 1) 
 (Verse 2:Muszamil) 
 I put my nuts and my heart in this shit 
 Them niggaz soften they jawz like a lil old bitch 
 I knew it 
 He ran his mouth off 
 And he ain't even do shit 
 A real nigga wouldn't even spoken or took it in 
 He coulda' got killed in here 
 Doin' that dumb shit 
 Ain't no love left this year 
 I love gunz that steady spit with extra long clips 
 A heavier clip that'll bury yo chest with 
 (Verse 3:Lil D) 
 Yo... 
 Why snitches die old 
 And souljahs die young 
 Why do fake niggaz live 
 And the real die by the gun 
 That shit got my strung 
 Ready to kill 
 Noted fa' real 
 Hit a nigga up and let's peal 
 Hom' we gon' bomb on these bitch made niggaz 
 Outlawz -- remember that we raise triggaz 
 New Street -- I'm biggin' up the hood and shit 
 We fightin' like brothers 
 But it's all good and shit 
 We stay strong 
 Us thug niggaz gon' live long 
 For them -- face three-eights ain't it action teflon 
 Killa Kash -- you know I can't forget you son 
 We was raised around gunz 
 Had a chance to blaze one 
 C'mon nigga -- on the run gotta get myself 
 And get money on my own 
 I ain't gettin' no help 
 We Outlawz 
 (Chorus:Young Noble) 
 Why snitches die old 
 And souljahs die young 
 We all born in the slum 
 Don't be playin' with gunz 
 Lil niggaz on the run 
 Better Dayz'll come 
 Young thugs all raised as 1 
 Where we at? 
 Why snitches die old 
 And souljahs die young 
 We all born in the slum 
 Don't be playin' with gunz 
 Lil niggaz on the run 
 Better Dayz'll come 
 Young thugs all raised as 1
