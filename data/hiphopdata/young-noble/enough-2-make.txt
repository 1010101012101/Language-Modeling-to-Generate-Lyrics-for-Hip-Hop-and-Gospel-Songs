Kastro 
 Enough to make a grown man cry 
 All ya life 
 All you wanted to be 
 Was somebody 
 With a college degree 
 Swore up and down that you ain't need me 
 I used to tell you all the time that it ain't easy 
 And --- Puppy love was all we had in the past 
 Now you a lady and you full of pizzazz 
 Tell me that I'm crazy 
 And that life won't last 
 And you might have been right 
 I'm still chasin' yo ass 
 I chose a life of bright lights in the fast lane 
 Outta the gutta all I wanted was to have thangs 
 And I can have you 
 And you can have me 
 Maybe a baby or two 
 Raise a family 
 But -- you had other plans for life that better suited you 
 Found you a man that you love and that's beautiful 
 And it hurt me to death 
 No I can't lie 
 But I'm a grown man 
 Still I wanna cry 
 Napoleon 
 Baby girl I appreciate how you rode 
 You stay down when my pockets start to reach low 
 And when they started to grow 
 You wasn't trippin' on no dough -- you know 
 You even told me how to make love with the lights off 
 I did you right -- It's so wrong 
 We went through hell together but you still stay strong 
 When my grandma died I put my head on yo shoulder 
 When I cry -- you reply let it out you's a soldier 
 And yo pops a punk 
 He took the first bus and jetted 
 Left a pretty precious girl behind 
 He gon' regret it 
 I ain't yo mami -- yo papi 
 But I'll do you just like daddy 
 Just ride or die wit me and I promise you stay happy 
 We spent bills together 
 Neva done pills together 
 But we both got drunk of Tequil' together 
 I made a promise to you 
 That Imma slow down on the road 
 And stop gettin' drunk everyday -- actin' a fool 
 And now we havin' a baby 
 Oh it's gon' be a lil Mu 
 Lil man, lil G 
 He 'bout to ride to work wit me 
 Hit me hard 
 You think that I ain't speakin' the wise 
 But it's enough to make a grown man cry 
 Let me make a deal wit you 
 Be real wit you 
 Look at me in my eye 
 If you wanted me to die I would try 
 (It's enough to make a grown man cry) 
 I been waitin for you all my life 
 You all I like 
 Picture what it would be 
 (What it would be) 
 You would be here next to me 
 I swear that's all that I would need... 
 (It's enough to make a grown man cry) 
 E.D.I 
 Black pearl grew up in this hellish world 
 Full of confidence and spunk 
 It ain't shit you could tell this girl 
 All about her chips -- hustle harder than niggaz 
 Bubble hearted wit figgas -- get the trouble started quick 
 Ever since she was a young'n she was always into somethin' 
 And when she got over 
 Drama was always on her shoulder 
 I guess being that alive 
 She had a lot of resemblance 
 God brought us both together to be eachother's protection 
 And I ain't mad at him 
 As matter fact daily I get at him 
 And thank him for sendin' you to me lady 
 Truly a gift from up above 
 You and me nobody stoppin' us 
 So when we together 
 They all watchin us 
 And I feel no pity for them suckas that didn't want ya 
 Cause nowadays even some women want ya 
 Fine as you wanna be 
 And you belong to me 
 My everything 
 For eternity 
 Now sing with me now 
 Let me make a deal wit you 
 Be real wit you 
 Look at me in my eye 
 If you wanted me to die I would try 
 (It's enough to make a grown man cry) 
 I been waitin for you all my life 
 You all I like 
 Picture what it would be 
 (What it would be) 
 You would be here next to me 
 I swear that's all that I would need...

 Young noble 
 It's just another day 
 Another day around the way 
 Pay attention -- to this story 'bout this girl named May 
 She been livin' on my block for like 2 years now 
 Here's how it went down 
 She was a good girl 
 Raised in the Decatur 
 She never even been to the city 
 It was easy to persuade her 
 I used to see her walkin' to the store but she never spoke 
 So sometimes all the homies had jokes 
 But she was shy 
 Only for a minute 
 Got introduced to the drugs 
 Baby girl start trippin' 
 Baby girl started strippin 
 She all turned out 
 Trust me 
 Jerzey real different than down south 
 Now all the homies on the block in and out of her house 
 They all found out she get down -- no doubt 
 She was a black angel 
 Now she all messed up 
 Show her a little cocaine and she give the sex up 
 Through the lust and the blunts 
 Another little problem 
 Some of them brothas wasn't usin' condoms 
 May wanna play 
 She gonna deal wit AIDS 
 But meanwhile -- May gotta baby on the way 
 And she don't even know who the father is 
 Her best friend cocaine 
 She don't want no kids 
 So she smoke -- and smoke 
 And got what she wanted 
 A beautiful black baby boy died in her stomach all for nothin' 
 Let me make a deal wit you 
 Be real wit you 
 Look at me in my eye 
 If you wanted me to die I would try 
 (It's enough to make a grown man cry) 
 I been waitin for you all my life 
 You all I like 
 Picture what it would be 
 (What it would be) 
 You would be here next to me 
 I swear that's all that I would need...
