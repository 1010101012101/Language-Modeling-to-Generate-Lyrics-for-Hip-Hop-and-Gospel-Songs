Young noble 
 Aye yo... 
 I got a special kind of baby 
 We don't go through too much drama 
 We always try to solve our problems 
 Even though she like to argue 
 And I sometimes I don't want to 
 Damn --- everyday it be always somethin' 
 I know she only mad 
 Cause her stinkin' ass love me 
 And lil Noble Justice ass look just like me 
 Even when she fight me 
 She really wanna kiss me 
 Even when she despise me 
 Her ass really miss me 
 I ain't lying I be missing her too 
 You had a good Baby Mama you'll be missing her too 
 It ain't a thang you could say about her 
 It ain't a day without her 
 Forever we bonded --- uh 
 Even though we argue to death 
 Girl you know I still love ya to death 
 My baby Mama 
 Even though we might fuss and fight 
 Best believe we gon' thug tonight 
 My Baby Mama 
 Even though I know I drive her crazy 
 She happy that she had my baby 
 My Baby Mama 
 We both mad 'cause I broke the house 
 We both mad 'cause we bonded for life 
 Young noble 
 She said I'm gettin' on her last nerve 
 At it too can outlast hers 
 And you can guess who get the last word -- uh 
 I let her get that 
 My son know who daddy is 
 I can remember when we ain't even had a kid 
 And that's a terrible thought 
 Some cats run from responsibility 
 Caught by the courts 
 But you judged by the court of the law 
 She ain't got a father to hug 
 And you ain't got a daughter to call 
 If yo baby mama yo wife 
 Or you got visitation rights 
 You need to make it right 
 It ain't ya life 
 Dawg it's the child involved 
 Get along 
 No matter what that's gon' be ya baby moms 
 If another nigga fuck her 
 You will not trust her 
 But you still gotta love her 
 Ya first baby mother 
 I ain't break the roof 
 Imma state the truth 
 Everyday ain't fruits 
 But we makin' it through 
 Come on... 
 Even though we argue to death 
 Girl you know I still love ya to death 
 My baby Mama 
 Even though we might fuss and fight 
 Best believe we gon' thug tonight 
 My Baby Mama 
 Even though I know I drive her crazy 
 She happy that she had my baby 
 My Baby Mama 
 We both mad 'cause I broke the house 
 We both mad 'cause we bonded for life 
 Ed bone 
 I might stay out late 
 From stackin' all the money I make 
 While them other bitches keepin' it fake 
 You was keepin' it real 
 With the young souljah out on the field 
 Plus I understand the way that you feel 
 You fuckin' with me 
 While them other bitches nuttin' to me 
 I knew that you was coming with me 
 It was no surprise 
 When I met you and I looked in yo eyes 
 You stopped fuckin' with them other guyz 
 It used to be some creep shit 
 Till we got into some deep shit 
 Said I got her pregnant 
 Said that she was keepin' it 
 I had her sprung 
 Lil mama was young 
 Neva thought that this time would come 
 Now you the one 
 Stickin' it out 
 With or without 
 Through the bullshit workin' it out 
 You be workin' yo mouth 
 But you get the benefit of the doubt 
 Any other bitch I'm kickin' her out 
 For my baby mama 
 Even though we argue to death 
 Girl you know I still love ya to death 
 My baby Mama 
 Even though we might fuss and fight 
 Best believe we gon' thug tonight 
 My Baby Mama 
 Even though I know I drive her crazy 
 She happy that she had my baby 
 My Baby Mama 
 We both mad 'cause I broke the house 
 We both mad 'cause we bonded for life 
 My Baby Mama
