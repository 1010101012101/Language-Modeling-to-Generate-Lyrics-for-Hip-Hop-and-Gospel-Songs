Live now, die later, flood or clock the shit out of haters 
 Got niggaz trying to "Kiss the Game Goodbye" like Jada 
 Get your shit pushed back like Jada's CD 
 I'll put your brains on that Kenwood TV 
 So you can see hell in 3D, it's right there dog 
 And the Game behind the desert is a nightmare dog 
 If it's pussy, I might share it dog, beef I'm right here dog 
 I'm on the block, white Nike Airs on 
 Gucci check, Coogi sweat, they wanna know 
 If 22's on the truck, give me coochie yet 
 But I come through in the new GS with two, three tecs 
 Got niggaz Harlem Shaking like the new G. Dep 
 Trying to read my whole script, but ain't seen the movie yet 
 Better have that Glock stuffed tonight 
 I'm coming through with Young Noble, and we, going, make, it 
 A block bust tonight 
 Getting American money easy, all I know 
 The gangsta all motherfuckers envy, all my dough 
 It's a West Coast knot, watch, let it bang out 
 Shots range out, for all the gangster hangouts 
 Lace your tips, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas 
 You can't ball? Then it's probably the haters 
 Can't breathe then it's probably the desert, if you a gangsta or not 
 I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot 
 And every nigga gonna cry when he hit, the more pain 
 The more blood drain, he ain't surviving shit 
 And your niggaz ain't gonna ride for shit, they know 
 If they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit 
 Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this 
 The Game the reason all these niggaz on that "Cali Love" shit 
 Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6 
 Fuck you up like one time will do 
 And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard 
 Coming hard, Doogie Howser pulling bullets out your jaw 
 Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket 
 You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it 
 We left a stain on your block, you came with a cop 
 Pointing fingers at them niggaz, that kept shit hot 
 Next to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thing out, homey we can bang out 
 Outlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out 
 Learn about your whereabouts and we right there 
 Me and Game have you left right there 
 N-o-b-l-e, o-u-t-l-a-w-z 
 We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese 
 I got niggaz out in Compton that'll find yo' ass 
 I got niggaz out in Jersey, that'll hide yo' ass 
 For a long time if you ever fuckin' with mine 
 It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud 
 We killing your squad, my homeboy still in the yard 
 You the type of motherfucker standing next to the God 
 The Game is deep, you motherfuckers ain't the streets 
 Young Noble and the homey Game flaming heat, come on
