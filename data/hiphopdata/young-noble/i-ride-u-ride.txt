Young noble 
 Uh... 
 Young Nobe how you do that shit? 
 Imma show you how -- nigga 
 We live for the rush 
 Cock it and bust 
 Who askin' for us 
 Who giving a fuck 
 Down on yo luck 
 Hand me down chucks 
 Come around and get stucked 
 Bitch what? 
 Sittin' ducks -- lift the cuffs 
 Hit 'em up -- you gon' blitz 
 Aye yo they got me peepin' the whole scene 
 My throat clean 
 Hold it in my jeans 
 All in a dream 
 Fiends get beat like -- Rodney King 
 Brand new TV won't cost a thing 
 I tuck mine unda' here 
 Won't floss a thing 
 Oh you niggaz bad 
 Dope sad and propped a lack joke wit my folks 
 Have a toast with my folks 
 Cause shit get hard 
 You only got two choices 
 Better listen to God 
 Piss in the yard 
 Imma dog tryna cleanse the block 
 My man needed a hand 
 So a lent a shot 
 Snitchin' cop 
 Who you think I'm talkin' to nigga? 
 We got souljahs with no problems talkin' to nigga 
 Darker the nigga 
 Vision dearly departin' a nigga 
 Homey life is what you make 
 You can take it or leave it 
 Break it or beat it 
 Now how you gon' taste it and eat it 
 Let's make it a secret and play it to keep it 
 Vegas on a weekend 
 Ride heated cause his nigs is creepin' 
 My range decent 
 Hidden by a longshot 
 Niggaz in the game say it's over when the Lawz drop 
 You ain't neva lied 
 Niggaz neva tried to harm us 
 We like piranhas 
 In this world of drama 
 Respect the karma 
 I Ride -- U Ride 
 Nigga we all ride 
 I'm High -- U High 
 Nigga we all high 
 I Try -- U Try 
 Nigga we all try 
 On the grind everyday tryna erase time 
 Young noble 
 Lit up a dust 
 Kick up some dust 
 Leave it to us 
 Everything ain't even enough to even us up 
 Leavin' 'em slump 
 I'm lyrically -- seekin' a crush 
 Now you bleedin' for what 
 High speedin' for what 
 Eatin 'em up 
 We swingin' the cut 
 Do or thang then what 
 Hell naw you can't swing wit us 
 I rock this with strategist and polish this 
 Obviously -- holy you'll see -- N-O-B-L-E 
 But don't get it fucked up 
 'Cause I'll cock the four 
 The greatest rapper to ever live 
 Was Pac Shakur 
 Y'all niggaz gotta be out cha mind 
 This shit wouldn't be going on 
 If the Don was alive 
 But now it's our time 
 And we gon' share light 
 How come somethin' so wrong 
 Feel oh so right 
 It's like my days is my nights 
 And my pain come to life 
 And the change is the price for the rage in my heart 
 On the stage in the dark 
 Tryna find my way 
 Ain't no time to play 
 Either ride or lay 
 I Ride -- U Ride 
 Nigga we all ride 
 I'm High -- U High 
 Nigga we all high 
 I Try -- U Try 
 Nigga we all try 
 On the grind everyday tryna erase time 
 I Ride -- U Ride 
 Homey we all ride 
 I'm High -- U High 
 Homey we all high 
 I Try -- U Try 
 Homey we all try 
 On the grind everyday tryna erase time 
 I Ride -- U Ride 
 Souljah we all ride 
 I'm High -- U High 
 Souljah we all high 
 I Try -- U Try 
 Souljah we all try 
 On the grind everyday tryna erase time 
 I Ride -- U Ride 
 Killa we all ride 
 I'm High -- U High 
 Killa we all high 
 I Try -- U Try 
 Killa we all try 
 On the grind everyday tryna erase time
