Young noble 
 Aye yo is heaven got a ghetto then I'm chillin' with Yak 
 And if heaven got a ghetto then I'm visiting Pac 
 Cause the world down here 
 So cold through my eyes 
 And my first piece of work got sold when I was 9 
 And I didn't realize what I was doing was wrong 
 Mom Duke was smoked out 
 And my pop was gone 
 I got a big brother Shawn 
 I don't see him a lot 
 Even though we fight yo 
 I still love him a lot 
 My uncle Carl just died 
 And I couldn't even cry 
 I couldn't even sleep 
 Couldn't even get high 
 My girl catch me 8 in the morning 
 Sometimes writing rhymes 
 Pain trapped inside 
 Like I got something to hide 
 It's enough to make a grown man cry 
 When you gotta sit back 
 And watch a grown man die 
 The pot of gold ain't promised at the end 
 But I'll do it all over if I had to again 
 E.d.i & noble (chorus) 
 ('Cause I gave me all) 
 And ain't nobody give me a damn thing 
 I had to go out and get it mayne 
 (Get that dough) 
 It ain't all about the money 
 But ain't a damn thing funny when ya hungry 
 (Hard times come) 
 But I ain't the one to run 
 I stay in the trenches until the job is done 
 (I will not fail) 
 Aye yo I'm playing to win 
 And if I had to I'll do it again 
 Young noble 
 Me and my mom at the same time doin' a little bid 
 I was dumb keepin' coke in the crib 
 I had to learn not to stash where you live 
 But I was up makin' money from her friends 
 I wanna live 
 Cause back then we wasn't doing too good 
 But I did what I could to get my mom out the hood 
 I grew up in the ghetto 
 But she raised me right 
 Even though I was young 
 Stayin' out all night 
 Make some money on my own 
 So I thought I was grown 
 Hennessy kept me warm 
 Imma sleep on the floor 
 Believe in the Lord 
 Better yet -- believe in yoself 
 It might be nobody there when you need some help 
 Hard times back then 
 Made me stronger within 
 And I'll do it all over if I had to again 
 E.d.i & noble (chorus) 
 ('Cause I gave me all) 
 And ain't nobody give me a damn thing 
 I had to go out and get it mayne 
 (Get that dough) 
 It ain't all about the money 
 But ain't a damn thing funny when ya hungry 
 (Hard times come) 
 But I ain't the one to run 
 I stay in the trenches until the job is done 
 (I will not fail) 
 Aye yo I'm playing to win 
 And if I had to I'll do it again 
 Young noble 
 I ask myself sometimes do I deserve all this 
 I ask myself sometimes is it worth all this 
 I ask myself sometimes do they feel my pain 
 I ask myself sometimes is it really a game 
 I ask myself sometimes is there a future in rap 
 Some cats get jealous 
 Wanna shoot me in my back 
 I ask myself sometimes do I really got homies 
 Will anybody care if I wasn't gettin' money 
 I ask myself sometimes can I last in this 
 I ask myself sometimes can I mash to this 
 I ask myself sometimes can I do it again 
 But that ain't even a question 
 Imma souljah till the end 
 (To the end)
