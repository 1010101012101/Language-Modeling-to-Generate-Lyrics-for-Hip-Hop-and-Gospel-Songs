Young noble 
 When I die don't say nothin' 
 Cause y'all ain't neva loved me 
 If you say you did -- you frontin' 
 Heard you wanted to slug me 
 God hate ugly 
 But only God can judge me 
 Trust me -- all that fake thug love shit disgust me 
 Sometimes I wish these muthafuckas hurry up and bust me 
 Sippin' mad Henny 
 Rollin' my ashes in a dutchy 
 The world sayin' fuck me 
 Well fuck you too 
 If it ain't no love for me 
 Ain't no love for you 
 Mama always told me 
 These muthafuckas ain't shit 
 They gone when you broke 
 But they there when you rich 
 The fact is this 
 You need to handle ya own business 
 Stop ridin' all on my dick 
 Nowadays -- ya family be the worst fuckin' ones 
 It seem like to them money thicker then blood 
 Show me some love 
 A young thug need some too 
 Wonda' why my young souljahs walkin' around all evil 
 Cause nobody give a fuck if we die tonight 
 So when we die don't cry aiight (aiiight) 
 Cause nobody give a fuck if we die tonight 
 So when we die don't cry aiight (aiiight)

 Shed no tears

 According to the thug laws 
 A young souljah 
 Young Noble Outlaw 
 Is my niggaz down to die for me? 
 (Yay Yayyyie) 
 God niggaz showin' love from dirty Jerz till the Bay 
 But got muthafuckaz hatin' from New York to L.A 
 But it all come with the came you choose to play 
 Playin' tapes out the blockbuster 
 Or gettin' chases by the cops cause you a block hustla 
 Ride or Die 
 I got my eyes on the big picture 
 If we on the same page 
 Nigga I'll stick wit cha 
 But if we ain't 
 You on some bullshit 
 I'll get wit cha 
 I owe you somethin'? 
 How you figure? 
 I'm a MADE NIGGA 
 Get the finger 
 So respect this if you don't respect yaself 
 'Cause I'm a souljah 
 Everyday I test myself 
 You gotta give it if you want it (huh) 
 And my mistake is the respect and you want it (huh) 
 You gotta take it 
 When I die muthafucka 
 Don't shed na'l tear 
 If you ain't show me na'l bit of love when I was here 
 I swear -- that's why we have gangs and brotha's 
 They'll rather see us die 
 Then tell us they love us 
 Fuck 'em! 
 So if we die do the same for us 
 Shed no tears

 E.D.I 
 No time for waitin' 
 Times are wastin' 
 The clock ticks quicker nigga 
 Go on and get it nigga 
 Strapped -- but these words'll start 
 My deadly mission depart 
 From baby kitchen 
 While she bitchin' -- I'm already gone 
 I ain't bullshittin' 
 Me and my niggaz gotta reach the top 
 Go head and complain bitch cause the game don't stop 
 And the world keeps spinning 
 And everybody in it 
 Keeps spinning with it 
 Wishing for seven digits 
 You plan to pay heaven a visit 
 But right there 
 That's a contradiction 
 'Cause if you see them gates you ain't visiting -- uh 
 You there to stay 
 No time to tell ya baby girl to wipe those tears away -- tears away 
 Here today and gone tomarrow 
 They mourn yo ass in sorrow 
 Yo legacy'll follow 
 Ya peoples is left hallow 
 Yeah I know 
 That's how the game go 
 Fa sho' 
 Napoleon 
 I woke up in the morning ta' death 
 Hallow from right to my left 
 Confusion since 
 When I go just lay my Tek on my chest 
 And stress ain't shit 
 In a ordinary day for my clique 
 And twisted love with the wrong bitch 
 So fuck y'all and y'all relationship 
 This my life and I'm livin' it 
 From the fake friends and bitches 
 From the fake smiles and kisses 
 This real love and it's business shit 
 Do you dig this and my problem 
 Never see you cause you see through 
 I'm absolute -- 100 percent -- thugged out with a ridahs permit 
 To the overdose -- I'm doing it 
 On my mama I ain't knew this 
 And true this 
 Got caught up doin' the wrong things, so truest 
 Put ya money where ya heart is 
 Damn you ain't got no money or no heart 
 So of course you shut down from the start 
 Why the fuck you smile in my face 
 When I'm in pain why you cry 
 You scream Mu nigga I feel you 
 But no that's a lie 
 So don't cry nigga 
 And don't cry nigga 
 Ride on muthafucka -- Outlaw
