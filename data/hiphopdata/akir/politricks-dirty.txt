I don't follow the news 
 They just add to my blues 
 Politicians and their big feets 
 Could never fill my shoes 
 They don't care, think all well off welfare 
 It's hell here 
 Why should I vote like it's ever been fair? 
 My people in despair, they still balance 
 We hit hard like still melons 
 Smile intentions of the founders, and they still countin' 
 No child left behind, read between the lines 
 Tryin' to control 
 Their precious minds 
 Armies in the school line 
 Ridicule, for tryin' riddling Junkies 
 What a powerful country 
 That keeps, promotin off flunkies 
 18 years old and your brain is like lunch meat 
 Programmed to follow these dummies 
 To the suburbs to the slum streets 
 Pull us over soon as they see blacks in the front seat 
 So I'ma run streets, fuck freaks and causing dumb beats 
 Me and mine is gonna be fine 
 Fuck standin' at the picket line 
 I'm tryin' to get these dollar signs 
 Dodgin' time 
 Yo 
 Politicians that be gargling that garbage shit 
 Borgawood anonymous 
 Officers the opposite 
 Doctrines for illegal tended documents 
 Pocketin' the profits of the rockets 
 While they kick us out the projects, logic 
 Surprsing' common sense 
 Risin' occupants 
 Supply the vitamins 
 Survivin' and they got you doin' 5 to 10 
 Just the other day, I was pissin' out some toxins 
 When the cops rolled by 
 I gotta take it on the block again 
 Sendin' letters included 
 As a child offender for indecent exposure 
 I should'a looked over my shoulder 
 My cousin got locked 
 Pop's lost his job, we evicted 
 Waitin' on section 8 
 But the list had been restricted 
 A Lexus hit and I missed it 
 I was dealin' with some real shit 
 My brother joined the service 
 Not even nervous to get hit 
 Saying that he's out kid, geek 
 They got Saddam ousted 
 I pray because he's bout' it 
 Now he's tryin'a get up out it 
 They make's us wanna shoot the coppers 
 Like they makin' rolling robbers 
 For the pride in which they rob us 
 Every time that they stop us 
 He try to give us vouchers 
 To move us out the hood 
 But when we try to use 'em 
 Damn the shit's is no good 
 I got a letter from my brother 
 Said the media confuse ya 
 The Army Navy game 
 Was slippin' Quarters from Fallujah 
 No proper armor when they move us 
 Damn we Trapped, Cursed 
 Shiites is soon to surround us in Iraq 
 Kerry lost 
 Colin Powell doin' the town 
 Ashcroft's assed off 
 The shit is even getting more foul 
 Network, of elected delegates 
 Are all derelicts 
 Look how shiesty Kerry get 
 Damn it's all relevant 
 It's never how they tell it is 
 So I gotta get my shit straight 
 And handle my biz 
 The next time I have to go vote 
 I might go 
 Plus I heard there's a lot of jobs 
 And lot of fine ass hoe's, in Ohio
