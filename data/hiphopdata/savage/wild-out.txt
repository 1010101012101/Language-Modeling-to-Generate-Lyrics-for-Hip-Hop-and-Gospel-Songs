 Speak my roots and yeah I rep it 
 Raise that rain man without question 
 Muscle man 
 Hustle man without flexin 
 In the lamba grindin out 
 Then I hit the clubs straight wildnout

 Your girlfriend was on me like all night 
 Now she wanna ride like raw hide 
 Trooper the young do it mover

 Puttin' women on my lure 
 You need no map girl

 See the handprint under her panties 
 War in the speakers

 Checkin' out the baby with the big ol knockers 
 Ima front six

 Yeah she's already got a redbull 
 Gettin' ready for the headbull 
 Late night stay awake till I getchu
