Word! Why! Hey 
 Here we go... 
 For the man from the Islands... 
 Savage where is at? 
 I wanna go back to the Islands 
 Back to the roots 
 Pack my bags up and be there soon 
 Coconut trees and island breeze 
 And nothing but white sand up under my feet 
 Just chill relax and just stay still 
 Be like baby d and walk around in a kilt 
 A kilt in samoan its ie lavalava 
 'Cause it's too hot for your jeans my brother 
 Its something like 100 degrees 
 So when it gets hot I'm dip in the sea 
 Put snorkels on swim in the reef 
 Yeah I love water like fish when they breathe 
 Now I'm gonna roll like a pair of dice up in the plains 
 In my paradise 
 Come experience that island life c'mon its something I know you gonna like becos 
 It's the one place that everyone wants to go 
 Come see the tropics is the place I get to call my home 
 Love the islands 
 I love the islands ooh 
 One place that I get to call my home 
 Back to islands, back to the motherland 
 That's where mum slapped dad and my brothers at 
 That's family bond and when I step out the house I got my jandals on 
 I'm from the island of samoa the heart of the pacific 
 The home of romance and passionate kisses 
 Hot summer breeze coming 
 From the sea 
 That's the bomb place where I wanna be 
 Chillin' in shade ice tea 'n' lemonade 
 Man I could do this like everyday 
 Hell yeah 
 Damn I love the islands you don't even need money you can off the land 
 Build a little house than grow from that 
 Everytime you leave you don't wanna come back 
 And when you do you don't ever wanna leave just stay right here and be a local like me yeah
