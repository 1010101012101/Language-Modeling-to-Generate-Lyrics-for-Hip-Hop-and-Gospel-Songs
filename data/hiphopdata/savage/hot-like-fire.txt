(Feat. Rock City) 
 Savage: 
 Savage, Rock City's with me 
 Where my DJ's where my where my DJ's! 
 This is for the club this is this is for the club 
 This is for the girls this is this is for the girls 
 Come on 
 (Chorus x2: Rock City) 
 Gal you hot like fire 
 You are burnin' the place up 
 Such a pretty face 
 That's why there's no need for make-up 
 Savage: 
 See I like the way you move (move) 
 Dancin to the tune (tune) 
 Girl is hot like fire when her body is so smooth 
 Yeah her curves up on her waist, the smile upon her face 
 I feel so good when she walks and walks my way 
 (Bridge: Savage) 
 So she's (so she's) my queen (my queen) 
 And I feel just like a king when she's standin next to me now 
 (Pre-Hook: Rock City) 
 See shawty took the night off 
 She say she want to go to the club 
 As soon as they turn the lights off 
 The girl went down on the flo-o-o-o 
 Girl went down on the flo-o-o-o [x3] 
 Savage: 
 This club is moved from wall to wall 
 I'm steady tryin' to walk 
 You stand out up in the crowd when you're dancin on the floor 
 The hottest girl in sight but she cool as ice 
 So cool that she sendin all these chills up my spine 
 (Hook: Rock City) 
 She wind it up and the DJ play it again 
 She walk it up like the (unable to understand) 
 (Pre-Hook x2)
