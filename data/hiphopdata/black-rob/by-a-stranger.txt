We came to give love to our die hearted real bitches 
 That stick through they man through the bullshit 
 Good lovin' and good fuckin' all night long, what makes a young killa feel strong (you know) 
 You from black thongs to black (stem hope) you know 
 With a lifestyle bigger than don knockers, with a left hand body guard like john rocker 
 Kill the cracka, you served pain but that didn't stop ya 
 Offered the money, gotsta prosper 
 Blame me for the babies we kill, ain't that I'll, 
 I'm the one who wants to go to hell with it and I'm (and I'm hoping to kinda self finish) 
 Held closely by a stranger 
 Father Dear (I know you want to touch me) 
 Well if you hear me (you know you want to touch me) 
 I said father dear (you know you want to kiss me) 
 Well if you hear me (I want you to kiss me) 
 I said father dear (I know you want to fuck me) 
 Well if you hear me (but why can't you love me) 
 I've been held, closely by a stranger 
 She moved above the law, 50 gs in the floor 
 Type to bring with me a key right to her door 
 Waiting (for drugs law), livin' the china white 
 If you got her high enough you could fuck her with a stick of dynamite 
 Tie her up (smack her), have your way 
 I met her Wednesday had that by Saturday 
 She was half black, born in south korea 
 Raised in an orphanage, the men would often come to see her 
 The nuns didn't stop the soldiers from raping her 
 Which is why she had panic attacks like kim bassinger 
 Months went by, I heard she put bass (in the store, lit it with a stove) 
 Stole all the crates and a soul, I saw it in her face she was losing control 
 Confused in her role, the cash flow disintegrated like her ass yo 
 She fell victim, to the rotten apple 
 Say goodbye (to the boss, kingpin wants a divorce) 
 She was diagnosed with cancer, heard it from the source 
 Now she (wanders) from, manger to manger, looking to be held 
 Held closely by a stranger 
 Father Dear (I know you want to touch me) 
 Well if you hear me (you know you want to touch me) 
 I said father dear (you know you want to kiss me) 
 Well if you hear me (I want you to kiss me) 
 I said father dear (I know you want to fuck me) 
 Well if you hear me (but why can't you love me) 
 I've been held, closely by a stranger 
 Saw me running through, gun (in) side your face (goose) 
 Saw what the struggle do, I mean you act like your fake friends is lovin' you 
 They undress in front of me and I'm uncomfortable 
 Figure I'll just come to you, and try to confide 
 But then I start thinking about the last time you lied 
 Don't care what you got to hide 
 What I saw burned my eyes like chloride 
 All I wanna know is why, I wasn't even tryin' to spy 
 Come home (dice for bed stop) all inside 
 Should have known, all you did was was pull me down 
 I should have grown, canceled the mortgage on the home 
 (Dead to me saying your fault), I let you roam 
 Now I gotsta leave you alone 
 Harsh reality is the case 
 Like when you spit in the wind, it might come back in your face 
 I just came to get my shit, no anger 
 You was the one kissing a stranger 
 Held closely by a stranger 
 Father Dear 
 Well if you hear me 
 I said father dear 
 Well if you hear me 
 I said father dear 
 Well if you hear me 
 I've been held, closely by a stranger
