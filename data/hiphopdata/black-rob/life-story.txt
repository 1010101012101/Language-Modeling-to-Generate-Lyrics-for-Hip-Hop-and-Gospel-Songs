 The world ain't no different now 
 The world ain't no different now... 
 (Black Rob) 
 Never had a dime, my life a crime 
 Had me when I was nine, mom drunk off of wine 
 Ran with all kind her mind stayed wit the stupor 
 Till a point she paid no mind to the supper 
 Stay mad but stay fronting with smiles 
 Stayed on the ground once and a while 
 First day of school never had nuttin too style 
 Mister Colondre stressin I ain't comin' in a while 
 It was a bummer, rocking the shit I rocked all summer 
 On the first day I was feeling some kind of way 
 And she wasn't trying to do nuttin 
 You would think for the sake of the kids 
 She would enroll in school or somethin' 
 Now I know then was even harder 
 Especially for a single mother raising me with no father 
 Shit living up in this tenement, eating stale M&M's 
 Talking wild shit to Spanish immigrants 
 I speak in codes, man to severence 
 Always quiet then ben dichon to my madre 
 Even though she did nuttin for me 
 Acknowwledge me as I run down my life story 
 You don't know how crazy it is outside, I die inside 
 Oh I've cried oh I've cried; 
 Do you forgive me?? Do you forgive me?? 
 (Black Rob) 
 Check the skit, nobody never gave me shit 
 If anything a nigga frame me and make me get 
 3 to 6 my first bid, no doubt up in Spofford 
 Had to be 12 son had to make a profit 
 Remembering robbed my moms wit no guilt 
 Eating pork and beans or corn flakes wit no milk 
 In school I smacked cats in a hurry 
 Moms didn't care she was getting drunk wit Mrs. Berry 
 On the first floor - I used to thirst for greenery 
 Picking pockets wit Seth and Jay from 106th Street 
 Yo fuck home, I'm tired of getting punched in my dome 
 Tired of this faggot ass nigga moan 
 That's when I started roaming, my hustling game is deep 
 Cats ya heard; ran from San Fran to Manhattan to Newburg 
 Notorious tell ya friends spread the word 
 Glorious my life story is absurd 
 (Chorus) - repeat 2x 
 Home from Elmira, got a little wider 
 I'm gonna keep it real still a scheme man conniver 
 Recognize the struggle lI've it like a thug do 
 Hatred in my heart but inside I love you 
 See no matter what I will extend my arms to hug you 
 Knowing I am just like you, I am like the double 
 All I wanna know is how you pound me down 
 Yo this shit is real and you really jerked me around 
 But any way I am getting paid wit puff now 
 I can cop you a house I can send you some stuff now 
 So many levels jail take you 
 I appreciate jail because it made me appreciate you 
 I've been through fire and birth stone 
 Ised to be ???? not I cop the gem stone 
 I remembered when you rushed me 
 The time you said you should of flushed me 
 I forgive you ma trust me 
 (Chorus) - repeat till end
