It's about to get bananas in here 
 Hey, look at that ape over there bathing 
 Banana Zoo, ooh, baby 
 Do what you wanna do 
 Banana Zoo, ooh, shawty 
 Move like an animal 
 Now go down low, don't stop now 
 Swing like Orangutan 
 Now take it slow, gonna walk now 
 And watch him do his thing 
 But just don't tap the glass 
 Don't tap the glass 
 I'ma tell you, I go crazy 
 I beat on my chest 'cause I am the best 
 I'm the king of the jungle and I ain't lying 
 Get it? I ain't lying, I ain't lying, no, I ain't no lion 
 And you can tell King Kong, he don't run this 
 You can't throw no monkey wretch in this 
 Now what's the name on my tag? That's right 
 Banana Zoo, ooh, baby 
 Do what you wanna do 
 Banana Zoo, ooh, shawty 
 Move like an animal 
 Now go down low, don't stop now 
 Swing like Orangutan 
 Now take it slow, gonna walk now 
 And watch him do his thing 
 But just don't tap the glass 
 Don't tap the glass, don't tap the glass 
 Don't tap the glass, don't tap the glass 
 Don't tap the glass, oh, oh 
 Gorilla go, Gorilla, go, go 
 Gorilla go, Gorilla, go, go 
 Gorilla go, Gorilla, go, go 
 Gorilla go, Gorilla, go, go 
 Now move like a monkey 
 Now move like a monkey 
 Now move like a monkey 
 Now move like a monkey, hold it 
 Hey, can you tell Mr. Zookeeper 
 To please order me a thousand pounds 
 Of banana pudding? I would love that
