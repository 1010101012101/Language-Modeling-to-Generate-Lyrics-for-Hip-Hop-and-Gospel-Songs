With a nigga like me... 
 She said please, mercy me, mercy me 
 Let me fall outta love, before you fuck her, before you fuck her 
 She thanked me, she gave me all her pills 
 Now my back hurts, she lost control 
 Now she begging, she on the floor, she on the floor 
 Baby got her pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor 
 She said, it won't be long before she falls out of love 
 Won't be long before she falls out of love 
 Just a bird, tried to kiss you 
 But you never let me miss you 
 But you never let me miss you 
 I thought I told you 
 I'm not him 
 I'm not him 
 What you did, nobody forced your hand 
 And don't you fall for a nigga like me, I beg, I beg 
 Now you're pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor 
 Now you're pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor 
 She said "it won't be long" before she falls out of love 
 It won't be long, before she falls out of love 
 If she only knew 
 Trust me girl
