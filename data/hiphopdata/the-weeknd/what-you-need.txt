Aaliyah: 
 There now hold me close 
 There now hold me closer 
 There now hold me close 
 There now hold me closer 
 There now hold me close 
 There now hold me closer 
 The Weeknd: 
 I just want to take you there 
 He don't got to go nowhere 
 Does he touch you here like this? 
 Let me take the friction from your lips 
 And I'mma love you girl, the way you need 
 Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon'stop us 
 And I'mma give you girl, what you feel 
 I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain 
 He's what you want, he's what you want 
 He's what you want, he's what you want 
 I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you need 
 I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you need 
 He's what you want, he's what you want 
 He's what you want, he's what you want 
 I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you need 
 I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you need 
 I got everything you want from me 
 I do everything he does times three 
 And he don't gotta know 
 I got you on the floor, doing things you never thought you'd do 
 Baby leave them high heel shoes 
 'Cause I'm loving the way you looking down at me, I'm looking up at you 
 And I don't give a damn shorty watch me knock your boots off 
 And I'mma love you girl, the way you need 
 Ain't no one gon' stop us, ain't no one gon'stop us 
 And I'mma give you girl, what you feel 
 I'm the drug in your veins, just fight through the pain 
 He's what you want, he's what you want 
 He's what you want, he's what you want 
 I'm what you need, what you need, what you need 
 I'm what you need, what you need, what you need 
 He's what you want, he's what you want 
 He's what you want, he's what you want 
 I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you need 
 I'm what you need, what you need, what you need, what you need
