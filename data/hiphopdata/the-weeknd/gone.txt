I got you 
 I got a hold of you 
 Said you want to see 
 How we roll 
 Well take a seat (take a seat) 
 And we'll just 
 Drink it, drop it, drink it, spill it 
 Baby, touch your body, body 
 You gotta, taste it, feel it, rub it on me baby 
 Don't you worry, you gotta keep up 
 'Cause I been gone, I been gone, I been gone, I been gone 
 Girl 
 Why don't you fuck what you heard, baby 
 'Cause I been gone 
 You can see for yourself, lady 
 Girl, I lit you something 
 Something something, for you 
 You would love to pass around 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Oh well just- Drink it, drop it, drink it, spill it 
 Baby, touch your body, body 
 Gotta taste it, feel it, rub it on me baby 
 Don't you worry, don't you worry, you gotta keep up 
 'Cause I been gone 
 I've been gone, I've been gone, I've been gone 
 I've been gone, I've been gone 
 I've been gone, I've been gone, I've been gone 
 I hope I make it home 
 You'll be thinking of it 
 I got the whole city on my side, tonight, tonight 
 Watch us rock it out 
 Watch us leave it girl 
 After the show is done 
 You can take take me to yours 
 But my lungs so bloody 
 I love the way you taste 
 Drink it till I'm horny baby 
 Fuck me while I'm faded 
 Feel that through my pennant 
 Babygirl I gotcha 
 I'm only 21 so I do it when I wanna 
 Gone from the codeine, 'methazine, weed 
 Got me feelin' kinda weak 
 And it's kinda hard to breathe 
 But you're turning 23, so I'll fuck you if you need 
 In your birthday suit 
 I'mma give you what you fiend 
 But I ain't taking off my black boots 
 I'm fallin' 
 'Cause I'm numb from the neck down 
 I'm sorry 
 You won't know that I can't feel it 
 I get with the fuckin' loose girls 
 By the way I fuckin' did it 
 And you won't ever fuckin' know 
 'Cause I won't ever fuckin' show it 
 Except when I be wheezy from that other cup of potion 
 Dirty spiked toastin 
 Fast life fuck slow 
 Low life for life 
 Let the mix flow 
 Let the night flow 
 I'm so gone 
 Let these meds flow 
 I'm so gone 
 Let these meds flow 
 I'm so gone 
 I'm so gone 
 Whoa, whoa, oh 
 Said I'm gone gone gone 
 Whoa oh 
 I'm so gone 
 Gone
