Now your thinkin' 'bout it 
 Girl you're thinkin' 'bout it 
 What we got here 
 How we fuckin' got here 
 They recognize 
 They just recognize 
 I'm in a life without a home so this recognition's not enough 
 I don't care about nobody else 
 'Cause I've been on these streets way too long 
 Baby I've been on this too long 
 It's getting faded too long 
 Got me on this rolling stone 
 So I take another hit 
 Kill another seroton' 
 With a hand full of beans 
 And a chest full of weed 
 Got me singing 'bout a bitch 
 While I'm blowing out my steam 
 Yeah I know I got my issues 
 Why you think I fuckin' flow? 
 And I'ma keep on smoking till I can't hit another note 
 Ooh, but until then 
 I got you 
 Baby I got you 
 Until you're used to my face 
 And my mystery fades 
 I got you 
 So baby love me 
 Before they all love me 
 Until you won't love me 
 Because they all left me 
 I'll be different 
 I think I'll be different 
 I hope I'm not different 
 And I hope you'll still listen 
 But until then 
 Baby I got you 
 I got you 
 Girl I still got you 
 I got you
