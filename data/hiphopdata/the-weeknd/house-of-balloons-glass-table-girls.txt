Been on another level 
 Since you came 
 No more pain 
 You look into my eyes 
 You can't recognize my face 
 You're in my world now 
 You can stay 
 You can stay 
 But you belong to me 
 You belong to me 
 If it hurts to breathe 
 Open the window 
 Oh, your mind wants to leave 
 But you can't go 
 Siouxsie Sioux and the Weeknd: 
 This is a happy house (A happy house) 
 We're happy here (We're happy here) 
 In a happy house 
 Oh this is fun, fun, fun, fun (This is fun) 
 Fun, fun, fun, fun (This is fun to me) 
 Fun, fun, fun, fun 
 The Weeknd: 
 Music got you lost 
 Nights ends so much quicker than the days did 
 Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift 
 This place will burn you up 
 But baby it's okay, they my niggas next door 
 They be working in the trap, so get louder if you want 
 Just don't blame it on me girl 
 That you didn't call your home 
 Just don't blame it on me girl 
 'Cause you wanted to have fun 
 If it hurts to breathe 
 Open the window 
 Oh, your mind wants to leave 
 But you can't go 
 Siouxsie Sioux and the Weeknd: 
 This is a happy house (A happy house) 
 We're happy here (We're happy here) 
 In a happy house 
 Oh this is fun, fun, fun, fun (This is fun) 
 Fun, fun, fun, fun (This is fun to me) 
 Fun, fun, fun, fun 
 The Weeknd: 
 Bring the 707 out 
 Bring the 707 out 
 Bring the 707 out 
 Bring the 707 out 
 Bring the 707 out 
 Bring the seven 
 Two puffs for the lady who be down for that 
 Whatever, together 
 Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it 
 Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it 
 Then, watch us chase it 
 With a handful of pills, no chasers 
 Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers 
 And she bad in a head band 
 Escaping, her van is a Wonderland 
 And it's half-past six 
 Weed's nice 'cause time don't exist 
 And when the stars shine back to the crib 
 Superstar lines back at the crib 
 And we can test out the tables 
 We got some brand new tables 
 All glass and it's four feet wide 
 But it's a must to get us ten feet high 
 She give me sex in a handbag 
 I got her wetter than a wet nap 
 And no closed doors 
 So I listen to her moans echo 
 "I heard he do drugs now" 
 You heard wrong I been on them for a minute, we just never act a fool 
 That's just how we fuckin' livin' 
 And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it 
 Yeah I'm always on that okey dokey 
 Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony 
 Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me 
 Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me 
 "Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?" 
 "She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony" 
 I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story 
 Yeah I'm talking 'bout you man, get to know me 
 Ain't no offense though, I promise you 
 If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth 
 But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams 
 And we could turn this to a nightmare, Elm Street 
 La la la la la la la la 
 I'm so gone, so gone 
 Bring out the glass tables 
 Whip the 707 out 
 La la la la la la la la 
 I'm so gone, so gone 
 Bring out the glass tables 
 Whip the 707 out 
 La la la la la la la la 
 I'm so gone so gone 
 Bring out the glass tables 
 Whip the 707 out 
 La la la la la la la la 
 I'm so gone so gone 
 Bring out the glass tables 
 Whip the 707 out 
 Whip the 707 out 
 Whip the 707 out
