She pop that pussy on a Monday, she never falls in love 
 But she heard me in the club, she put in work 
 She wanna give me all her money, she used to spend it all alone 
 'Cause her man went and did her wrong, so she 
 But baby I'm not trying to be the one 
 I got my baby waiting home, she been too good to let that go 
 And I ain't tryna win your heart and you can't pay to win my love 
 So keep dancin', baby, keep dancin', dancin'

 (Baby I want you) I'm too far in this game, so let go, so let go, so let go 
 (Baby I want you) Baby, who you tryna fool? 
 Girl, I might be twenty-one but I got memories to prove 
 That I've seen your kind before and I know exactly what you want 
 You just want me 'cause I'm next, you just want me 'cause I'm next, baby
