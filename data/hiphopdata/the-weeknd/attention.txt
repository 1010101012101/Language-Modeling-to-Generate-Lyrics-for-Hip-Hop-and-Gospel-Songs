Baby, you were so strong 
 Baby, you were calm, you were so calm, yeah 
 Tell me where it went wrong 
 Tell me how to love, it's been so long 
 When a call's not enough, and you just need to touch 
 Thinking twice on my one 
 But you just need to trust 
 You're only looking for attention 
 You only notice it 'cause I'm never around 
 You're only looking for attention, oh, oh 
 You're only looking for attention 
 The only problem is you'll never get enough 
 You're only looking for attention, oh, oh 
 What do you expect now? 
 Only thing left is the sex now 
 Cause baby, too vexed now 
 Only see me on the TV or the bed now 
 When it touched my mouth 
 You were more than a fuck 
 Thinking twice, I'm the one 
 But you just need to trust 
 You're only looking for attention 
 You only notice it 'cause I'm never around 
 You're only looking for attention, oh, oh 
 You're only looking for attention 
 The only problem is you'll never get enough 
 You're only looking for attention, oh, oh 
 Attention 
 (Love all the attention, baby) 
 Attention 
 (Love all the attention, baby) 
 You're only looking for attention 
 You only notice it 'cause I'm never around 
 You're only looking for attention, oh, oh 
 You're only looking for attention 
 The only problem is you'll never get enough 
 You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
