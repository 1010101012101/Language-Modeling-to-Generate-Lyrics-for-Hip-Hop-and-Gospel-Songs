Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron 
 Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more 
 Lost your C notes, cabbed all day 
 Took the bus back home, evictions on your door 
 Blame it on the weed, blame it on the booze 
 Blame it on the night life, light's passin' you, yeah 
 Just don't blame it on me, that you wanna come and party 
 With a nigga like me, 'cause I get it, you're built like a Goddess 
 And it seems like you been stressin' 'specially when your nose red 
 From that K, special Diet Coke, you need more bread 
 Now you got no rent, you blow that money, money 
 You try to window shop, you blow another hundred 
 She's fuckin' goons in the day, hipster nights downtown 
 And your daddy don't know you're out 
 If they don't let you in, you know where to find me 
 'Cause if you wanna go again, you can always call me 
 'Cause all we ever do is love 
 Open up ya' mind, you can find the love 
 Girl you ain't alone, we all been alone 
 Baby just be honest 
 XO, oh, don't you forget 
 XO, don't you worry 'bout a thing 
 XO, we'll be everything you need, just believe 
 XO, yeah, XO, whoa 
 I love it when your eyes are red 
 Ah yeah, are you on my cloud yet? 
 'Cause I got a brand new cam, can we video feed, can we POV? 
 Oh why, I wanna catch you at your best 
 When your hair's a mess, you look so depressed 
 And you're filled with regret and you feel like you gotta go home 
 'Cause these nights pass so much quicker then the days did 
 Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift 
 But you up you need money for your face lift 
 Lust over love is your mindset 
 Waken up with most of your side wet 
 Another room, you hear your mom cryin' 
 'Cause she found your bag stuffed in the laundry 
 And the Bacardi from the last party 
 If they won't let you in, you know where to find me, oh 
 And if you wanna go again, you can always call me 
 'Cause all we ever do is love 
 Open up ya' mind you can find the love 
 Girl you ain't alone, we all been alone 
 Baby just be honest 
 XO, oh, don't you forget 
 XO, don't you worry 'bout a thing 
 XO, we'll be everything you need, just believe 
 XO, yeah, XO, whoa 
 I need, I need something from you 
 Oh, there's so much love to pass around 
 There's too much love 
 Girl, the night's almost done 
 And who you came with is already gone 
 You said you want me 
 But I remember who you are 
 Girl, it wasn't long ago 
 Didn't think I'd go this far 
 I got a test for you 
 You said you want my heart 
 Well, baby you can have it all 
 There's just something that I need from you is to meet my boys 
 I got a lot of boys 
 And we can make you right 
 And if you get too high 
 Baby, come over here and ride it out, oh, oh, ooh yeah 
 Ride it out, oh, oh, whoa yeah 
 Ride it out 
 Ride it out, ooh 
 Just ride it
