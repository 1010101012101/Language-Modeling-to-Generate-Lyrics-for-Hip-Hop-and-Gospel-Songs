Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute 
 I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah 
 (Said) Said nothing will ever be, ever be the same when you're finished 
 I freed a couple souls, just yesterday, oh yeah 
 I had a good girl in my room 
 No tats on her skin, I put work all in her purse 
 She got guilt all in her grin 
 And I swear it be the same every fucking where that I've been 
 All you girls try to be saints, I'll make you wanna sin 
 You can come to my hotel, you can bring me a friend 
 You can dress up like twins, I can teach you some French 
 Paperplanes full of kush, a couple cups full of gin 
 Don't know what city I'm in, wake up and do it again 
 And you know me well, I don't like to talk 
 But when I make a move, you know it's loud as fuck 
 And if you wanna scream, get loud as fuck baby 
 I can tell your friend, I'm good at the instruction 
 A little bit, a little bit, oh yeah 
 Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute 
 I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah 
 (Said) Said nothing will ever be, ever be the same when you're finished 
 I freed a couple souls, just yesterday, oh yeah 
 Do you feel like you'll come back around? 
 Does it make you strong? 
 Do you feel like you can take the planet on, oh girl 
 Did I seem to give you a little bit more love 
 To your lonely life, to your empty life 
 Little life, little life, oh yeah 
 Do you feel like you got your money's worth 
 'Cause if you did, this round's on me 
 Just promise that you'll come back to me, 
 Feed me baby, feed me baby 
 Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute 
 I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah 
 (Said) Said nothing will ever be, ever be the same when you're finished 
 I freed a couple souls, just yesterday, oh yeah
