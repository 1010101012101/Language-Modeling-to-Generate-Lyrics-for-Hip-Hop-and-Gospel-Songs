It seems like pain and regret are your best friends 
 Cause everything you do leads to them 
 You think I could be your best friend 
 Baby I could fuck you right 
 Baby you could have it all 
 Baby you could have it all 
 Baby you can have the cars 
 The clothes, the dreams, the sex, the house 
 Baby you could be a star 
 Baby all these things are your best friends 
 And nothings ever ever your fault 
 Nothings your fault baby, no 
 Baby you don't need your best friends 
 'Cause I got everything you want 
 Baby you could have it all 
 Baby you could have it all 
 Baby you can have the cars 
 The clothes, the dreams, the sex, the house 
 Baby you could be a star 
 [If, all I could say is if 
 Promise me you won't regret me when you're touching on my skin 
 Let the wrong path come to me 
 One day I'm hoping that you, will remember me 
 When you fuck them you'll see my face 
 My body is yours 
 Give them any other day but Thursday 
 You belong to me 
 Every Thursday 
 I wait for you 
 I'll be beautiful for you 
 Every Thursday 
 I exist 
 Only on Thursday] 
 Not on Monday, Tuesday, wendesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday 
 But on Thursday... 
 Not on Monday, Tuesday, wendesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday 
 But on Thursday...
