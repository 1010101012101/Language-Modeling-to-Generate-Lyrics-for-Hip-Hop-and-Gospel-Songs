Laisse tomber les filles 
 Laisse tomber les filles 
 Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera 
 Laisse tomber les filles 
 Laisse tomber les filles 
 Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera 
 Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là 
 Non, je ne pleurerai pas 
 Non, je ne pleurerai pas 
 Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là 
 Je ne pleurerai pas 
 Je ne pleurerai pas 
 Oh I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me 
 Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased 
 Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me 
 'Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be 
 It could have went so many ways, so many ways it can go 
 'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone 
 So if I said that I won't call, the lying comes natural to me 
 You probably could have had it all, you could have been that lonely star 
 If we just went on 
 If we just went on, oh no 
 If we just went on 
 If we just went on 
 Happiness exists when you don't know a thing 
 So I hope you don't think this song is about you 
 And only I can know how close you came 
 But baby I'm a pro at letting go, I love it when they come and go 
 It could have went so many ways, so many ways it can go 
 'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone 
 So if I said that I won't call, the lying comes natural to me 
 You probably could have had it all, you could have been that lonely star 
 If we just went on, ooh 
 If we just went on, ay 
 If we just went on 
 If we just went on 
 If we just went on, ooh baby 
 If we just went on 
 If we just went on 
 If we just went on, aw yeah, oh yeah

 Non, je ne pleurerai pas, oh 
 Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour-là 
 Je ne pleurerai pas
