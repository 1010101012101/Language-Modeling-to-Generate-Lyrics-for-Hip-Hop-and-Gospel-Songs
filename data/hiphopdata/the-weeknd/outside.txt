I'll let you show me his moves 
 Let you do what he taught you 
 Let you reminisce how you used, to do 
 Girl I'm open to anything that would get you into that zone 
 And understand that we're all alone 
 So you can slowly take off your clothes 
 Baby girl you know what's in store 
 Baby I will stay up all night 
 I've been goin' hard since last night 
 And I'ma go harder tonight 
 Wish you could see you through my eyes 
 Ooh I'm tellin' you this ain't the same 
 And I know he's still in your brain 
 I'm 'bout to burn that shit into flames 
 Once I'm in you 
 Baby 
 Forget what you know 
 Make yourself at home 
 Cause baby when I'm finished with ya you won't wanna go 
 Outside 
 And I'ma work you like a pro, baby 
 And, you gon' take it like one 
 Yeah you gon' take it like one 
 And I'ma give it like you asked for it 
 Why, 'cause you been talkin' 'bout it 
 I know you been talkin' 'bout it 
 Ooh baby when I'm done with you 
 You ain't sayin' nothin' 
 Yeah you ain't sayin' nothin' 
 Ooh baby when I'm done with you 
 You ain't sayin' nothin' 
 Yeah you ain't sayin' nothin' 
 You gon' make me show off 
 All the pain that you feel you can tell that we ain't makin' no love 
 But I'll pretend 
 Oh girl, I'll pretend 
 If you pretend then girl I'll pretend 
 Let's make it seem like we're all we need in the end 
 Forget what you know 
 Make yourself at home 
 Cause baby when I'm finished with ya you won't wanna go 
 Outside
