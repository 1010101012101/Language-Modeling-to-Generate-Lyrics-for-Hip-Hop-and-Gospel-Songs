I love her, today 
 'Cause it's Wednesday, I won't be late 
 I don't need to know if you're feeling when I'm free 
 Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday 
 Sunday but on Thursday... Thursday 
 Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday 
 Sunday but on Thursday, make sure you are thirsty 
 Oh on Thursday, baby get ready oh on Thursday 
 Woaahoooh hold it oh on Thursday, just wait on Thursday, baby only Thursday 
 Can I try? Can I try? 
 I've been here for too long 
 Baby don't cry 
 Why are you calling again? 
 But It's not Thursday, baby why you calling? 
 Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday 
 Sunday but on Thursday... Thursday 
 Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday 
 Sunday but on Thursday, make sure you are thirsty 
 Oh on Thursday, baby get ready oh on Thursday 
 Woaahoooh hold it oh on Thursday, just wait on Thursday, baby only Thursday 
 Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday
