Oh no 
 Oh no, oh no 
 You'll never make me stay so take your head off of me 
 I know your every move so won't you please let me be? 
 I've been here times before but I was too blind to see 
 That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me 
 She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby do what you please 
 I have the stuff the you want, I am the thing that you need" 
 She looked me deep in the eyes, she's touchin' me so to start 
 She says there's no turnin' back, she trapped me in her heart 
 Dirty Diana, no 
 Dirty Diana, no 
 Dirty Diana, no 
 Dirty Diana 
 Let me be, ooh 
 She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town 
 Every musician's fan after the curtains comes down 
 She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige 
 Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree 
 She's saying, "That's okay, hey baby, do what you want 
 I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt 
 And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far 
 I'll be your everything if you make me a star" 
 Dirty Diana, oh 
 Dirty Diana, no 
 Dirty Diana, oh 
 Dirty Diana 
 Dirty Diana, ooh 
 Dirty Diana, no 
 Dirty Diana, nah 
 Dirty Diana 
 Let me be, ooh 
 She said, "I have to go home 'cause I'm real tired you see 
 But I hate sleepin' alone why don't you come with me?" 
 I said, "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight" 
 I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright 
 Diana walked up to me, she said, "I'm all yours tonight" 
 At that I ran to the phone, sayin', "Baby I'm alright" 
 I said, "Unlock the door because I forgot the key" 
 She said, "He's not coming back because he's sleeping with me" 
 Dirty Diana, oh 
 Dirty Diana, oh 
 Dirty Diana, oh 
 Dirty Diana, oh 
 Dirty Diana, oh 
 Dirty Diana, oh 
 Dirty Diana 
 Let me be, ooh 
 Oh no 
 Oh no 
 Oh no 
 Oh no
