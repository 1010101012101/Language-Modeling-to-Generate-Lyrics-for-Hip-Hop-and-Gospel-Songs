There comes a time in a man's life 
 Where he must take responsibility 
 For the choices he has made 
 There are certain things that he must do 
 Things that he must say 
 Like I Love you 
 And I need you 
 I only want you 
 And nobody's goin' to know if it's true 
 I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (tonight) 
 My hand on another girl 
 I wish I didn't have to lie 
 I wish I could let you know 
 'Cause I love you 
 And I need you 
 I only want you 
 And nobody's going to know if it's true 
 Valerie 
 (Oh Valerie) 
 I know you can see through me 
 (I know you can see through my lies) 
 Valerie 
 (Oh Valerie) 
 You just choose to never know 
 (No you just don't know what I do, what I do, oh Valerie) 
 Valerie 
 Why pretend to trust in me? 
 (I don't know why you try to trust in me baby, but I think I might know) 
 Valerie 
 (I know, Valerie) 
 You'd rather this than be alone 
 (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) 
 'Cause I love you 
 And I need you 
 I only want you 
 And nobody's going to know if its true 
 And I love you 
 ('Cause I love you baby) 
 And I need you 
 (When I need, need...) 
 I only want you 
 And nobody gonna know...
