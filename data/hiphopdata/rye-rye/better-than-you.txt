Anything you can do I can do better 
 I can do anything better than you no, you can't 
 Yes, I can, can't 
 I see it in the magazines, you're jackin' my shit, no, you can't 
 I see it on the street, stray rockin' my shit, no, you can't 
 Bet I do it better, way better than the chive, no, you can't 
 So what you do is small, I'm a do it real big 
 The hell I bet that your image is dead 
 I showed you how to do it, like you was my kid 
 I was some big hair and she went and got a wig 
 Whether you laid it, bitches cappin' red bricks 
 I think of poor slits, the real got the more and 
 Swathy said she got hers from the warm muslin 
 She start castin', I'm G, smart and what I said 
 That she said, it's in the heart, man 
 Anything you can do I can do better 
 I can do anything better than you, no, you can't 
 So you're in the magazines wearing my shit 
 Anything, I can do it better, no, you can't 
 Heard you singing songs that sounds like me 
 Anything, do I can do it better, no, you can't 
 And when I wear my tennis shoes 
 I wear 'em way better and when I wear my heels 
 I wear 'em better and when I get my hair done 
 I get it way better then I go and get my nails done better than you 
 Shawty, got brace so he swear that he the thug 
 I got that Amy Chu so I look at him and mug 
 He standin' on the corner posted out, with a thug 
 But I don't do those I can post through the sun 
 He got old jeans, I got the newer ones 
 You got dark blue, than I'm frackin' the bluer ones 
 She got on the justin, I got on the cuter ones 
 And she go to public school, I got the tutor on 
 So you're in the magazines wearing my shit 
 Anything, I can do it better, no, you can't 
 Heard you singing songs that sounds like me 
 Anything, I can do it better than you 
 And when I wear my tennis shoes 
 I wear 'em way better and when I wear my heels 
 I wear 'em better and when I get my hair done 
 I get it way better then I go and get my nails done better than you 
 I go in the tense hence and the sunsight case 
 But I'm all, "Hey mister, beat you to the famous" 
 Seen you at the party 'cause I'm pu-pu-pushin' 
 You think about the wall pass painting 
 'Cause girls been through round something looking more 
 And I bet you to do and do damn rock 'n' roll 
 Facebook, face facts, girl, you know you lie 
 Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla and she calls back 
 So you're in the magazines wearing my shit 
 Anything, I can do it better 
 Heard you singing songs that sounds like me 
 Anything, I can do it better than you 
 And when I wear my tennis shoes 
 I wear 'em way better and when I wear my heels 
 I wear 'em better and when I get my hair done 
 I get it way better, then I go and get my nails done better than you 
 You wanna be the next one, wanna be the next one 
 Wanna be the next big thing, wanna be the next 
 Wanna, wanna be the next, wanna, wanna be the next big thing 
 So you're in the magazines jackin' my shit 
 I see it on the street, stray rockin' my shit 
 I do it better, way better than the chive 
 So what you do is small, I'm a do it real big 
 Wanna be the next, wanna, wanna be the next 
 Wanna, wanna be the next big thing 
 Wanna be the next, wanna, wanna be the next 
 Wanna, wanna be the next, wanna be the next big thing 
 So you're in the magazines jackin' my shit 
 I see it on the street, stray rockin' my shit 
 I do it better, way better than the chive 
 So what you do is small, I'm a do it real big
