I got my eyes on the prize 
 And I'm ready to cash it in 
 Which dude wanna be my win? 
 I'm lookin' for a naughty friend 
 That don't mind me partyin' 
 And he's so "Hot Tamale" and 
 Chilled out... no cardigan 
 And you can meet me in my bedroom, baby 
 As long as you know how to drive a girl crazy 
 You'll be Donald, I'll be Daisy 
 Gotta put in work can't be lazy! 
 And when I feel that heat it's on 
 We freakin' all night long 
 And when the music comes on, he be jumpin' off strong inside 
 Boom boom boom 
 I want you in my room 
 Let's spend the night together 
 I wanna be with you 
 Boom boom boom 
 I want you in my room 
 Lets make this last forever 
 Just me and you together 
 Boom boom / Boom boom boom 
 Boom boom / boom boom boom 
 Boom boom / boom boom boom 
 La Dee Ah Dee Ah Dee I get 
 Tingles when I see that boy 
 So hot he can be my toy 
 And we won't get real wild 
 And take all night to the early morn' 
 All the little things just turn me on 
 Take me to the crib we can watch some porn 
 Or we can lay in the grass and watch the sky, just like real love was born 
 Late hours, candle light, that's the way you like it, right? 
 A little bit of shiver, a little bit of slice 
 That's the shit that keeps it nice 
 Pleasure pain, sweet and sass, 
 On and On make it last 
 And I don't wanna be a Bonnie and Clyde 
 Aiight 
 Boom boom boom 
 I want you in my room 
 Let's spend the night together 
 I wanna be with you 
 Boom boom boom 
 I want you in my room 
 Lets make this last forever 
 Just me and you together 
 Boom boom boom 
 I want you in my room 
 Let's spend the night together 
 I wanna be with you 
 Boom boom boom 
 I want you in my room 
 Lets make this last forever 
 Just me and you together 
 Boom boom 
 Boom boom boom 
 Boom boom 
 Boom boom boom 
 Boom boom 
 Boom boom boom 
 Boom boom 
 Boom boom boom 
 Come and squeeze me, come and kiss me 
 Come and squeeze me, come and kiss me 
 Come and squeeze me, come and kiss me 
 Put your hand upon my cheek 
 Hold me tight, and don't let go, your loving got me feelin' weak 
 You blow my high, and you're so sweet, takin' all my energy 
 And I wanna / boom boom boom 
 And I wanna / boom boom boom 
 Like a video game PS3 
 Come on over let's Plug 'n' Play 
 Every girl: "got a freaky side of me.." Hey! 
 Who gives a fuck what they say? 
 Give it to me baby like Ah Ah 
 Everybody talkin' that Rye Rye 
 Boom boom boom, bitch, blah, blah, blah 
 Boom boom boom 
 I want you in my room 
 Let's spend the night together 
 I wanna be with you 
 Boom boom boom 
 I want you in my room 
 Lets make this last forever 
 Just me and you together 
 Boom boom boom 
 I want you in my room 
 Let's spend the night together

 Lets make this last forever 
 Just me and you together
