As a youngsta I've always been around some funk 
 I'm watchin' niggas duck from buck shots of the pump 
 Bein around this shit made a nigga violent at times 
 Servin' D the dope was beatin' 'em down if they don't sell mine 
 'Cause you know that's how the fuckin' game goes 
 Niggas gettin' beat with bats gettin' stalked with steel 
 Toes a nigga was no older than thirteen or fourteen 
 When the bank was on I cocked a gun from a dope fiend 
 Little six shot, 38 special 
 When the bank is on you got to beef strong livin' up the ghetto 
 Me and my niggas walkin' around straight gasin 
 Mug on mean funkin wit niggas all in my classic 
 Four deep is how niggas roll up in Frisco 
 And everywhere you go a nigga got to pack a pistol 
 The beef is back on but I don't really know the reason 
 Supposed to be a truce but niggas start bangin' 
 So I'm lettin it be known I'm fadin niggas with the chrome-9 
 Me and my niggas walkin' around with Macs and the 45 
 So how you wanna handle your biz ya bitch made mark 
 Leave ya dead to the head in Ocean View Park 
 'Cause when the bank is on niggas comin' out the cuts 
 Wit artillery in their hand ready start to buck 
 Have them bitch made niggas tryin' to make my day 
 'Cause that's how it is when you're livin' in the bay 
 Comin' up in the bay it's like a motherfuckin zoo 
 The Bay Area ain't no joke 
 Every nigga do whatever the fuck he gotta do 
 The Bay Area ain't no joke 
 Boom boom boom was the sound that I heard 
 As I walked to the turf and took my hide 'cause I was perved 
 Thinkin' to myself I hope my niggas ain't hit 
 'Cause you know niggas dyin' young over stupid shit 
 Ran to the turf to see what happened 
 Find out my niggas was cappin at some niggas that was gasin in a Cut 
 Freeze classic come to find out it was them niggas that we was funkin wit 
 Ain't gonna say no truce to set 'cause I be startin shit 
 But you know how the story goes livin' in the bay 
 V-Town, Oaktown, Richmond, and E.P.A. 
 Frisco words goin' down all the fuckin' time 
 For all young niggas on the bang when they on the grind 
 Niggas walkin' around packed packin nines and carryin Macs 
 In they nuts or they draws pocket a crack sack 
 Po's on the turf waitin' for some shit to go down 
 Niggas comin' up short fuckin' wit the fogtown 
 'Cause in Frisco you never can predict 
 'Cause in the town man the fog is just too thick 
 And niggas gettin' smoked comin' up short where I live 
 Another dead body washed up by the Bay Bridge, nigga 
 'Cause that's how it is where youngstas livin' 
 Where niggas always takin' and they never givin' 
 So you better listen what I gotta say 
 'Cause that's how it is when you're livin' in the bay 
 Livin' day by day by the bay it's the same thing 
 Niggas smokin' dank sellin D and gang bangin' 
 Livin' in the illy-ac-town of San Fran-psycho 
 Where niggas doin' drive-bys on motorcycles 
 Got crooked ass niggas who jack for a livin' 
 But I can't blame a nigga 'cause ain't nobody givin' 
 A motherfuckin thang so I bang for mine 
 Even if it means robbin and killin' when you're on the grind 
 'Cause a nigga gots to have some type of funds 
 And niggas kicked out the house can't have no moms 
 And a nigga gotta do anything I can 
 Even if it means rushin every set wit rocks in my hand 
 And that right there tells you that life's a bitch 
 A nigga got three strikes and they swung a pitch 
 And that's how niggas live day by day 
 'Cause that's how it is livin' up in the bay mane
