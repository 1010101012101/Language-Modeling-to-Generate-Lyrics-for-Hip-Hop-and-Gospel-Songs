Yeah, it's the remix 
 P-Money on the beat 
 Ya know how we do it 
 This ma girl's song 
 So ladies listen up 
 This bout my lady 
 She knows who she is 
 Ay yo let's do it 
 When I'm with you I feel 
 I can do anything 
 I can just spread ma wings 
 I can just say some things 
 'Cause I feel comfortable 
 When I'm around you girl 
 We can do wot you like 
 Me and you against the world 
 Ever since the day you came 
 I haven't felt no pain 
 Ill never be the same 
 Now I know I love you 
 More than all my kicks 
 More than all my clothes 
 More than all my friends 
 More than all my flows 
 More than everything 
 You were there for me 
 Like you'd said you'd be (Just like you said it) 
 Through my darkest day 
 My coldest night 
 You'd hold me tight 
 You said id be all right 
 Wish I cud turn back time to when you were mine 
 2 words 
 Me and you 
 Lets just get away 
 Far away from it all 
 Lets find a better day 
 Everything's all right 
 We talked all night on the phone 
 Lets go just us all alone 
 I know I was unsure before but now I see 
 I love you more 
 More than all my kicks 
 More than all my clothes 
 More than all my friends 
 More than all my flows 
 More than everything 
 You were there for me 
 Like you said you'd be 
 Through my darkest day 
 My coldest night 
 You'd hold me tight 
 You said id be all right 
 Wish I cud turn back time to when you were mine 
 I never thought you would be 
 Everything that I need 
 Everything that I ever wanted 
 In you I can see 
 And then we made love 
 From the car to the house 
 To the hall on the wall 
 From the floor to the couch 
 Then I went away on tour 
 You said you missed my touch 
 I reply I love you 
 And you asked me how much 
 More than all my kicks 
 More than all my clothes 
 More than all my friends 
 More than all my flows 
 More than everything 
 You were there for me 
 I love you 
 More than all that shit 
 More than everything 
 My Lady 
 Yeah
