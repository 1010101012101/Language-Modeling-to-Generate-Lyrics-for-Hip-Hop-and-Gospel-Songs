Yo have you seen my B Tape 
 Thanks 
 If anyone rings I'm not home 
 There's a place that I go and I feel 
 Like I don't wanna see anyone that I know 
 And I need to be left on my own, 
 Be alone with my B tape I put 
 It on and I just escape I'm gone. 
 Up in the basement on my own, 
 On my own in the zone 
 Trying to finish this song 
 I can hear somebody's 
 Trying to ring me up on the phone 
 Please just leave the message right after the tone 
 'Cause I'm not gonna answer yal 
 You can ring till your blue in the face 
 And I'm not gonna get back 2 ya 
 Unless you're my manager 
 Otherwise I got no time to talk shit 
 You can call rovan cavander 
 Tryin' to get some down time 
 Like a rade and a far from the questions they ask in camera 
 I sit with my pen and my pad and my B tape 
 I put it and would have Neva imagined a MC like me 
 At the top of the game 
 I'm unlockin the chains 
 'Cause my friends turn to feems 
 Wif cracked rocks and they vein 
 And it's not gonna change so I'm lost 
 In the pain, paid the cost 
 Of my fame now I'm gone 
 There's a place that I go and I feel 
 Like I don't wanna see anyone that I know 
 And I need to be left on my own, 
 Be alone with my B tape I put 
 It on and I just escape I'm gone. 
 And still this beat is on repeat in my basement 
 I'm pasin back and forwards 
 Tryin' to find inspiration 
 But words they won't come to me 
 My mind is just faking 
 I put my favorite tape on and I try to escape 
 But then it starts coming back to me 
 My pen it starts racing 
 My thoughts elevating 
 They take off like a space ship 
 And now I'm on my way to my secret a place 
 That I go when I feel like I don't wanna say shit 
 And don't wanna talk to make small conversations 
 So leave me to be in my secret location 
 I open my book and I find a new pase 
 Take the phone off the hook 
 Have me Fan disengaged 
 And I put my B tape in the stero I push play 
 And I write down these words and it takes me away 
 You just got what your pa seen me saw 
 I was here just before 
 But I'm not anymore 
 Now I'm gone 
 There's a place that I go and I feel 
 Like I don't wanna see anyone that I know 
 And I need to be left on my own, 
 Be alone with my B tape I put 
 It on and I just escape I'm gone. 
 Gone listen to my song 
 Stuck and rewind me 
 I'm A.W.O.L. and you can't find me 
 And you can try me 
 But even you won't get through 
 And you can't even leave a message 
 Now my mailbox is full 
 Because I'm gone listen to my song 
 Stuck and rewind me 
 I'm A.W.O.L. and you can't find me 
 And you can try me 
 But even you won't get through 
 And you can't even leave a message 
 Now my mailbox is full 
 Because I'm gone
