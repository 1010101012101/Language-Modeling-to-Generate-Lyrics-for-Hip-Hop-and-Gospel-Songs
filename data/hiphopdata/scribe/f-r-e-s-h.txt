Fresh - forever rhyming eternally saving hip hop 
 I spell it out for you fresh like when my shit drop 
 S-C-R-I-B-E, the S-C chilling at the beach playing on my PSP 
 A lot of rappers stunting tryna claim they're the next me 
 They just fronting yo they know where the best be 
 And New Britain that's where I got my first house boy 
 Then I rode threw the east like the Decons (Deceptikonz) in South Aux 
 I'm self taught, and never selling myself short 
 Yeah every rhyme every sentence is well thought 
 And I never say die when and ever we vow for it 
 Yeah I beat them all off the docks to south pole 
 Whole life I been living in house corps 
 With the trap set right outside the mouse doors 
 And no money but never considered my self poor 
 Wasn't best dressed but was always so fresh so 
 F-R-E-S-H Fresh, Fresh, Fresh 
 My shit is fresh like F to R to E to S to H 
 Fresh Fresh Fresh, my shit is fresh like 
 F to R to E to S to H Fresh Fresh Fresh 
 My shit is fresh like F to R to E to S to H 
 Whoa! 
 Fresh like the sound of my voice when the beat drop 
 Fresh like the smell of the rain on the treetop 
 Fresh like the snow falling down on the ski slope 
 Fresh like the sea breeze scented with sea salt 
 Fresh like tic tacs and the grape flavoured mentos 
 Fresh like island girls and a whole can of impulse 
 It's not an insult 
 Saying I been dope 
 Since the first time 
 First rhyme my pen wrote 
 First verse I rehearsed and then wrote 
 That's my first work now you thirst my pen strokes 
 Plus I had to get the extra right 
 And then the winters started practising for extra night 
 I put my time into the rhyme to make it extra tight 
 And now what's really fresher than a pack of extra white 
 I know there's hope in the words that I'm yet to write 
 So from now till I exit light 
 I'm a bring it to ya
