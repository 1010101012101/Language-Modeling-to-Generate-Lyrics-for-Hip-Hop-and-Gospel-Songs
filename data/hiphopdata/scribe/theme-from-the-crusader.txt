Yeah 1,2 yes yes 
 Uh Scribble is back 
 Uh I'm from Christchurch the place of my birth 
 My home this earth represent my pep and there worth 
 Phillips town Philly baby translatin' the zone 
 Kind of sore ontrapanour rocking this microphone 
 I get busy like Bone keep my whole syphere in harmony 
 Can it be one of the worlds best from Cantabury 
 Straight from the under the Scribe the eighth wonder 
 Make no mistake and tell us the rock, the day is over 
 I'm creepin' on the come up from the square to the pier 
 Drivable wizardry for your whole atmostphere 
 Watch me do this for the love like Sumenalla Dub 
 I don't get caught up I'm the world you no we stay above 
 The physical is selfish and the spiritual is us 
 Lyrically combuss in our day it is a must 
 So well your mics rust I'm'a prove my crews well'a 
 I'm from the hometown of the Feelers and we don't feel ya 
 It's the Crusader represent city to shine 
 (Check it out world wide we got beats and flows) 
 It's the Crusada represent city to shine 
 (Reckonize the way we drop this universal) 
 It's the Crusada tight like Nathan and Arron Mauger 
 Do it first talk later 
 I'm runnin' things like I'm Robbie Deans I got a champion team 
 And you can hate it if you want but I am livin' my dream 
 I'm on the road to the Holy Grail and I will never fail 
 I get pribes I keep 'em locked like Norman Maxwell 
 You no I rap well that's for certain 
 Because I'm on point like Andrew Mertains 
 So for you fake MC's its curtins 
 I'm steppin up a level, for the silver I could never settle 
 I'm takin' the gold medal 
 I suggest you do the same 
 You best improve your game or get burnt by the Cantabery Flames 
 The home town of Anika Moa Crusadin' through this war 
 Best to find out who you fightin' for 
 'Cause I'm the best and there's none greater 
 Both sides of the equator, I battle like a gladiator
