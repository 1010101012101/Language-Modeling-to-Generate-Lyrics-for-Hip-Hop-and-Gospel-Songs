And I made through, and I made it through the, 
 Oh and I made it through the rain and the cold 
 Through the dark all alone 
 My life hit rock bottom I had no where to go 
 And if I could turn back time and change the road that I chose 
 All the mistakes that I made it burns a hole in my soul 
 And it took all that I had to get out of that hole 
 It took the birth of my sons to get back my control 
 So man I just went number one, ain't going back to the dole 
 I'm stronger than ever my enemies they thought I would fold and yo 
 CHORUS That's why I'm standing up, 
 I'm holding on to my life yo I gotta be strong 
 Now watch me rise you won't see me fall 
 I'm stronger now we can take them all 
 So alone and confused and my soul was abused 
 And a hand came of the handrail to throw me a noose 
 It took the love of my fam and my friends to show me the truth 
 I lived a lifetime of pain and I was only a youth 
 And its hard tryin' to swim in an ocean of fools 
 And I thought I catch a break but I'd broken the rules 
 And ma always told me take care of yourself 
 Lest the devil put a fork in the road that you choose 
 And even the strongest trees must grow from the roots 
 See a house without love ain't a home it's a roof 
 Its shelter without warmth and you know it's the truth 
 And I feel most at home when I'm alone in the booth 
 And my flow is unstoppable this poem is the proof 
 Its poetry pen and paper my label is showing the fruits 
 While I grow and improve and their all slow and observant 
 Exactly what you've learned and you know when they're throwin' the curve 
 And if their showing concern it's not cause their care 
 Its just 'cause they know what they owe in return 
 Time just feels like its taking me too long 
 The trials and tribulations are why I grew strong 
 Oh, tell my mother that I love her like no other 
 I'm holding nothing above her we made it out of the gutter 
 Did I stutter I came with the goods and for my fam 
 I came from the hood you got no choice but to plan 
 A way to make it out somehow we'll brake away 
 From these chains like che fu well never fade away 
 I came to stay made it through the rainy days 
 Never will I go astray came to take the pain away 
 That's why I'm standing up, I'm holding on 
 I just made it through the storm 
 By all rights I should be gone 
 They said id never make it I'll prove them all wrong 
 I took the pain now for so long 
 And I'm still here and it's my life and I'm not scared 
 Against all odds I got here give me your best shot yeah 
 'Cause I can take it I wasn't destined to make it 
 I was destined to forever burn in a Fiery lake
