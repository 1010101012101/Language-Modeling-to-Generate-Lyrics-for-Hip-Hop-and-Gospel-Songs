Type of individual hystirical, types of individual. 
 Far from the nonsense while peeps walk the streets in their sleep, I stay conscious ready to speak over beats for the needs I represent a thousand souls who never made it this far watching from the other side of the stars it's been a mission in mars pushin my music not just amusement I made this so you can use it for your own improvment not as a MC as a human livin' on the same earth and breathin in the same pollution everything was meant to be hip hop was sent to me keep the fame the money I hold it sentimentally own material things will return to dust eventually I'll be the MC those lyrics will last infinitely so to the death of me keep tryin' to snatch the breath of me negativity only brought out the best of me it was my destiny to be one of the illest I represent that to the fullest.

 Ay yo who said I wasn't ready- that scribe would never make it- the hateration only motivated me to take it kept hip hop sacred even though at times I felt forsaken make no mistake my skill is real there's no way you fake it I had the hunger since I was younger for bits and pieces check my crudentials the evidece to support my thesis that's if you don't believe it look for yourself and see it open you ears and hear the deepest air and speak it
