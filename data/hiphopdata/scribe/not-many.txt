 Congratulations, you made it 
 Welcome to 'The Crusader' 
 It's been a long time coming, yo 
 But I'm here now 
 So what'cha gon' do? 
 How many dudes you really know, can flow, like this 
 Like this, like this, 
 Let's do it, uh 
 How many dudes you know roll like this, how many dudes you know flow like this? 
 Not many, if any 
 Not many, if any 
 How many dudes you know got the skills to go and rock a show like this? 
 Uh-uh, uh-uh 
 I don't know anybody 
 Check, check to the mic check 
 1, 2 from a crew comin' through, are you hyped yet? 
 Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something on Scribe 
 But they ain't got nothing when I'm up and alive 
 You can't front when you feeling the vibe 
 You know Scribe is taking you high 
 Love it with the double bass 
 Vibration, the plates in your vertebrae 
 Y'all heavy man, move like a RS 
 Subaru, with a crew, come equipped like a body kit 
 Lyrically Bob Burnquist 
 So I'm footing his style to his tongue like a stalefish 
 This kid named X from the Vic, wanna get with the Scribe in live, like a 0-5 
 I got vibe like a beehive 
 And when the mother from the squid of a pimp of the sea side 
 And get you on to the way that we ride 
 Around town in the down low 
 Never know, what the flow, bro, chop chop 
 Can't stop hip hop 'cause it don't stop 
 Hmm, check it out (There's) 
 Check it out (No) 
 Check it out (One) 
 Check it out (Like me)

 Something for the ride on cruise control 
 When the bass vibrates, shook the vibe like a earthquake 
 Thought this is not good for you 
 You made a great mistake, your eyes stop thinking boomp, be gone 
 Sick of this, flick the switch 
 Nitrous, kick wanna trip, this is some new shit 
 Real deal like Holyfield, you know telling if you rock like Mike you just might 
 Rock like doobie drop, doobie drop tight 
 T-club get it on, representing all night 
 Take flight, like Nike kicks, with tricks 
 And make quick when the vibe hits 
 And don't sit just get on down 
 And profound with sound that we found with the underground 
 Don't sit just get on down 
 And profound with the sound we found with the underground
