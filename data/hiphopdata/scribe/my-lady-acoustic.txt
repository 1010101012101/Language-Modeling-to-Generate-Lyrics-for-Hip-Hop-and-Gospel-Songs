Scribe - MY LADY (Acoustic) 
 Aye yo 
 This ma girls song 
 Its called my lady 
 Let's do it! 
 More than all my kicks 
 More than all my clothes 
 More than all my friends 
 More than all my flows 
 More than everything 
 'Cause you were there for me 
 Just like you said you'd be (Just like you said it) 
 Through my darkest day 
 My coldest night 
 Kept hold me tight 
 You said id be all right 
 I wish I cud turn back time to when you were mine 
 (That's my lady) 
 When I'm with you I feel 
 I can do anything 
 I can just spread ma wings 
 I can just say some things 
 Becuz I feel comfotable 
 When I'm around you girl 
 So we can do wot you like 
 It's me and you against the world 
 Ever since the day you came 
 I havent felt no pain 
 Ill never be the same 
 Now I know I love you 
 More than all my kicks 
 More than all my clothes 
 More than all my friends 
 More than all my flows 
 More than everything 
 'Cause you were there for me 
 Just like you'd said you'd be (Just like you said it) 
 Through my darkest day 
 My coldest night 
 You'd hold me tight 
 You said id be all right 
 I wish I cud turn back time to when you were mine 
 (That's my lady) 
 Yo 
 2 words 
 Me and you 
 Lets just gets away 
 Far away from it all 
 Lets find a better day 
 Everythings all right 
 We talked all night on the phone 
 Lets go just us all alone 
 I know I was unsure before but now I see 
 I love you more 
 More than all my kicks 
 More than all my clothes 
 More than all my friends 
 More than all my flows 
 'Cause more than everything 
 You were there for me 
 Just like you said you'd be 
 Through my darkest day 
 My coldest night 
 You'd hold me tight 
 You said id be all right 
 I wish I cud turn back time to when you were mine 
 Now lets freak 'em on this one Jo Jo 
 I never thought you wud be 
 Everything that I need 
 Everything that I ever wanted 
 In you I can see 
 And then we made love 
 From the car to the house 
 To the hall on the wall 
 From the floor to the couch 
 Then I went away on tour 
 And you said you missed my touch 
 I reply I love you 
 And you asked me how much 
 More than all my kicks 
 More than all my clothes 
 More than all my friends 
 More than all my flows 
 'Cause more than everything 
 You were there for me 
 Just like you'd said you'd be 
 Through my darkest day 
 My coldest night 
 You'd hold me tight 
 You'd said id be all right 
 I wish I cud turn back time to when you were mine 
 (That's my lady n' I love you more than all those material things, id give it all up for you... don't forget that)
