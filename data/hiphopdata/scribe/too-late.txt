Scribe and ali and yeah we still together through the stormiest weather it's been along forever holding it down in the south surrounded by the southern alps with the lyrics hot fun if you know what I'm talkin' bout then throw your hands in the air I freestyle in the square then I'll catch a number five so I can rock at the pier get live I'm 90.5 the main source show spell it out for cats who don't know 'bout the F L O and we how move through the rain sleet hail and snow rockin' mic with our minds heart body and soul I'll be unsigned hype till I get creative control and I know the haters praying that the scribe wont blow but (it's too late) and I made it like that I sacrificed everything just to get where I'm at and to be honest I'm not stopping till I'm counting them grands and everythings on schedule and according to plan 
 CHORUS But so your out of time if you think your f***ing with mine because (it's too late) I know you didn't want to see scribe and ali doing our thing but (it's too late) yo, smiling at my face stab me in the back, its cool because (it's too late) because I'm here now it's our year but for you (it's too late) 
 Yeah it's too late scribe and ali since 98 still going, were still flowing like a can of speights still cut up the vinyl plates like a piece of cake still write songs to stimulate your mental state sharpen your state of mind catch up yo you way behind like even your anatomical clock is out of time we on a mission, moving up at a steady pace aiming for first place, so we got no time to waste and you can do it too the scribe is gonna show you how the only trick is that you got to d-d-do it now and stop sitting around like you got nothing to do say you can't do it then its already too late for you take out a leaf out of rhyme book you know I made it through can't teach a crowd if you can even educate the crew you know I came prepared training for several years I made it here without a second to spare 
 Said it's too late for haters out there trying to stop me now you never heard, yo I submerged from the underground this time I'm staying up and I ain't never comin' down I made it this far and I did it all by myself so think twice, if you think gonna take me out said you don't know me and you don't know what my crews about 'cause we've been doing this were not losing this and we've been proving were forever staying true to this get with the movement as I'm not hanging round for long in fact I'm gone, your too late you better check my song you know this lyrisist individualist MC puri- slash communication specialist even when effortless my skill can still rip a show this scribe is definitet so don't act like you didn't know I know you know my rhyme and you flow it line for line but it's too late to decipher cause you out of time
