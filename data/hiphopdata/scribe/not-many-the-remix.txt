Intro: Savage 
 Pito Saute Aukilagi! It ain't good, it ain't good 'cause you'll get jumped in my hood 
 Pito Saute Aukilagi! It ain't good, it ain't good 'cause you'll get jumped in my hood, ah! 
 (Adlibs) It's the remix! yeah, uh, yeah, c'mon... ah, savage 
 1st Verse: Savage 
 I'm hearin' you still talking that shit but none of your actions here are speakin' to me 
 I'm talkin' it, walkin' it, my stompin' style will stop your movement' 
 Hold up who's this? (aarrah!) Still leavin' you with cuts and bruises 
 So cut the bullshit before I rrrrock your face with a pool stick 
 Dirty, Dawnraid and Frontline, P-Money, Scribe, Savage and Con Psy 
 Everybody is feelin' that shit, I'm out your speakers like Ill Semantics 
 On stage for the crowd reaction, Everyone just bounce your asses 
 Keep it movin', uh-huh, New Zealand music 
 South Auckland raise your arms! 
 Let me see you throw it up! 
 And I will always represent my crew decep-deceptikonz! What! 
 Chorus: Scribe 
 How many dudes you know roll like this? 
 How many dudes you know flow like this? 
 Not many, if any 
 Not many, if any 
 How many dudes you know got the skills to go and rock a show like this? 
 Uh-uh, uh-uh, I don't know anybody... 
 (Savage adlibs) cha-hoo, yeah, yeah, c'mon, Savage!...aaaarrock a show like this! I don't know anybody 
 2nd Verse: Con Psy 
 You know who this is, act right 
 It's the kid comin' up that's flow is untapped 
 Wrote enough drafts, know enough raps, off the head skill that'll crush cats 
 But it's hard to spit without comin' off arrogant 
 And y'all insist on droppin' comparisons 
 And y'all who sit, mouths runnin' and chatterin' 
 Get off my dick, you're so fuckin' embarrassing 
 Y'all don't want no part of this, upon this ish 
 I serve the ill like a pharmacist, I'm on to this 
 I've been broke like promises 
 So if you get me started kid you're gonna see the consequence and y'all 
 Don't want that 
 'Cause I stay on, gimme you're words to play on 
 And I'ma make your writtens look thick like you lost your pen and wrote it in crayon 
 But yo, y'all should play the back like scenery 
 I'm dope, the writings on the wall like graffiti 
 So, y'all can't even hold your own 
 You get a manicure if you're goin' toe to toe 
 Suppose you know, that I treat tracks like kicks 'cause I'm clean when I lace mine 
 I break minds, If I put a watch in a bum bag that's the only scene where I waste time 
 Let's go 
 Chorus: Scribe 
 How many dudes you know roll like this? 
 How many dudes you know flow like this? 
 Not many, if any 
 Not many, if any 
 How many dudes you know got the skills to go and rock a show like this? 
 Uh-uh, uh-uh, I don't know anybody 
 (Con Psy adlibs) Frontline remix, Con psy up in it, come on, let's go 
 How many dudes you know roll like this? 
 How many dudes you know flow like this? 
 Not many, if any 
 Not many, if any 
 How many dudes you know got the skills to go and rock a show like this? 
 Uh-uh, uh-uh, I don't know anybody... 
 (Scribe adlibs) Congratulations, you made it. Welcome to the reeee-miiiiix! 
 3rd Verse: Scribe 
 Scribe's here so give it up (applause) 
 I never put the mic down when I pick it up 
 I rip it up so dope this year, everybody want a hit of us 
 But y'all need to breathe because you're hiccin' up (hic) 
 We refuse to leave you can't get rid of us 
 Yo, they think I'm drugs because I come in the club 
 And I be dancin' by myself like I don't give a fuck, what-what? 
 Scribe on the mic I write an elegant flow 
 Even drop adagio for the lyrically slow 
 Not hypothetically, physically lettin' you know 
 I got my rhyme packed tight and we're ready to go 
 Made some mistakes in the past, that was yesterday 
 Today I'm on my way to a better way 
 Forever bringing together what you separate 
 So whether, you like it or not I'ma elevate 
 You know this rhyme is me takin' time to celebrate 
 Relax and take a breath y'all (breathing) 
 I'm here to stay and not goin' away 
 And can I get a 'yes y'all? yes-yes y'all! 
 (Adlibs) ooh-ooh! 
 There's... check it out 
 No... check it out 
 One... check it out (ain't no one like me!) 
 Like me 
 Chorus: Scribe 
 How many dudes you know roll like this? 
 How many dudes you know flow like this? 
 Not many, if any 
 Not many, if any 
 How many dudes you know got the skills to go and rock a show like this? 
 Uh-uh, uh-uh, I don't know anybody 
 How many dudes you know roll like this? 
 How many dudes you know flow like this? 
 Not many, if any 
 Not many, if any 
 How many dudes you know got the skills to go and rock a show like this?
