Let Your Pistols Play it out (repeated) 
 To every real nigga in the game put your hand on heart make a pledge to the streets you will never ever talk 
 Death Before Dishonor nigga (x4) 
 Jury and the judge I put that on my life I'll never take a stand even if I'm facing life 
 Death Before Dishonor nigga (x4) 
 See these pussy ass niggas got the game twisted 
 Try to justify this thing they call dry snitching 
 Listen real niggas stay solid but these kanye west ass nigga trying speakin' through the wire 
 Fire that boy hot don't sell him nothing 
 He want an ounce now half a bird later 
 Them people coming 
 With them indictment papers 
 When I was a titty boy than call them hour laters 
 Our money ain't good better know that 
 When I was 7 alphabet boys snatched back 
 Phat! 
 It's what I got for you cheese eaters 
 Rat niggas that be fuckin' with them fed people 
 Dat nigga got loose vowels at the mouth 
 Solid niggas know the niggas that I'm talking bout 
 Ya it's blood money in this mother fucker 
 No need to ask questions 'cause I ain't sayin' nothing 
 Welcome to the Album haha
