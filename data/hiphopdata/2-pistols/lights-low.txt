Intro: 2 Pistols 
 She say, turn the lights off. 
 I'm like no! 
 (This is-this is-this is) 
 2 Pistols, Young Joe 
 I like my lights low. 
 Chorus: Young Joe 
 Lights down low, nice 'n' slow. 
 I'mma give your body what it's fiendin' fo'. 
 Lights down low, I'm a pro. 
 Ain't no limitations when this love unfolds. 
 Wanna do you over here, do you over there 
 Don't tell nobody the freaky moments that we share 
 Lights down low, oh oh low, oh oh low 
 Lights down low, oh oh low, oh oh low 
 Lights down low 
 Verse 1: 2 Pistols 
 I took a glance at the ??? it say two-thirty 
 DJ screamin' last call, vision blurry 
 She say she gon get freaky as I wan' her to be 
 So I took her home in the rover with me, we blowin' on trees 
 Down 275 shawty wide open 
 Goose got her loose, I reach down low, she soakin' 
 Wet for daddy, can I help you with that shawty 
 We at the masion now 
 Tongues touchin, caressin her body 
 Protection (what's next?) 
 I'm feelin' her I know she feelin' me 
 Where we goin' extasy 
 Ima beast with them lights down low 
 Multiple positions and l-l-l-lickin' fo sho 
 Wanna do you over here 
 Lights down low... low low 
 Do you over there 
 Lights down low... low low 
 Verse 2 : 2 pistols 
 Lights down, face down 
 You now what's up 
 Just love makin' now baby we don't ff... 
 What's that? leave that to them lames 
 We be poppin' champagne, strawberries and whip cream 
 Friends that intervene? 
 Private things, wildest dreams come true 
 It ain't no limit to the things that we do 
 Come closer I bet I work you like a 9 to 5 
 If she's not satisfied I put in overtime 
 From behind smack smack she say that's mine 
 Body like a goddess angel face so you know shawty ain't never lie 
 Ima beast with them lights down low 
 Multiple positions and l-l-l-lickin' fo show
