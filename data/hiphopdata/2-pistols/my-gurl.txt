(Feat. Slim) 
 Ay0 sweetie can ii talk to you for a minute 
 You got some pretty lips girl and I'm all in it 
 Wen she told me she was leavin' till neaxt year 
 Ii sed watz ya mathematics like x squared 
 N I'm a be better den da last 1 
 'Cause he stuck in the past like last month 
 Baby you want me and ii want you 2 
 And if you don't front on me ii ain't gon front on you 
 You da reason why ya boy gotta smile on my face 
 Me 'n' you gon keep goin' like a million mile race 
 You turn me on like a remote do a TV 
 Through all the ups and downs just lean on me 
 And all ya fake friends just let them be 
 Cause ii don't wanna see you stressed like ooh.eem.gee 
 It never really matted 2 much 2 me 
 That you was jus 2 damn old for me 
 All dat really matterd was you was my girlfriend 
 And baby datz all dat mattered to me 
 We could be like simese twins 
 I'm stuck on you like karate 'n' Chinese men 
 We could make it last together and last forever and keep you shined up like glass and leather 
 And maybe you can learn somethings 
 And you can have it yur way like burger king 
 Baby we could fly high in a g5 
 N ya lips yeah dey sweeter den a beehive 
 N if you don't get it I'm talkin' bout honey 
 And if you don't got it I'm talkin' bout money 
 I'm feelin' you so jus listen boo 
 We can fly past the haters like we invisible 
 It's killin' me while it's killen you 
 It's killin' you like it's killen me so let's survive da world just you and me 
 It never really matted 2 much 2 me 
 That you was jus 2 damn old for me 
 All dat really matterd was you was my girlfriend 
 And baby datz all dat mattered to me 
 As long as you my girlfriend 
 Ii don't mind if you have another girl friend 
 But just stay loyal like ya girls friend 
 And as long as I'm ya boyfriend and ya boy slim 
 Ii jus want you 2 chill and enjoy him 
 Cause every time we chill you make me happy 
 And we stay tangled up like hair datz nappy 
 Forget da other dudes cause ya boy is better 
 And all ii got 4 you is 4letters 
 And ii think you already know wat ii mean l-o-v-e yeah datz wat it mean 
 Ii remember da 1st time ii approached you girl 
 You look kinda upset so can ii hold you girl 
 It never really matted 2 much 2 me 
 That you was jus 2 damn old for me 
 All dat really matterd was you was my girlfriend 
 And baby datz all dat mattered to me
