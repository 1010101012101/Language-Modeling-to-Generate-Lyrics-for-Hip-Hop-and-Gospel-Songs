 Got my head to the sky and the city on my back 
 Grindin', you know where you can find me dead 
 President's homie cash, rule everything around me 
 I came from the bottom of the bottom, I ain't never goin' back 
 Got them Gucci locs fitted and the plastic on my lap 
 Grindin' you know where you can find me dead 
 President's homie, cash rule everything around me 
 Pinellas Count Von south Florida raised born in the slums 
 Where the young ain't safe never had a crum so a Thug 
 I became starded sellin' dope, just to get the new J's 
 My momma wasn't there, my daddy wasn't either 
 So I said fuck school, the block was my teacher 
 Wasn't good at math but I could break down a half in the pot 
 Let it rock in the block on smash that was high me 
 And my niggas ate, ate addicted to the fast cash 
 We was all flippin' big weight in and out a state 
 Gettin' cake like we won the lotto flyin' birds in the trunk 
 Like there's no tomorrow, that's the code that we live 
 By die by so now they don't sit high when I ride by 
 And BMU the Only niggas that I ride for till my eyes close nigga 
 I came from the bottom of the bottom, I ain't never goin' back 
 Got my head to the sky and the city on my back 
 Grindin', you know where you can find me dead 
 President's homie cash, rule everything around me 
 I came from the bottom of the bottom, I ain't never goin' back 
 Got them Gucci locs fitted and the plastic on my lap 
 Grindin' you know where you can find me dead 
 President's homie, cash rule everything around me 
 Money its one hell of a motivation 
 But it could put you in some fucked up situations 
 I learned how to flip that white but that white almost 
 Got me life, knock, knock, the feds at the front door 
 Half a brick in the toilet tryna flush more 
 What the fuck, I'ma do now, I'm locked up 
 How the fuck I'ma get out 
 On the road to riches and diamond rings 
 Got a pistol on my lap tryna get this green 
 Shit I'm tryna live that dream, stay fly like a nigga 
 Grew wings, I'm so fly in 'em thousand dollar jeans 
 D-boy fresh nigga from my head to my feet 
 And I'm a tell ya like pack told me 
 Cash rule everything around 2.P. 
 I came from the bottom of the bottom, I ain't never goin' back 
 Got my head to the sky and the city on my back 
 Grindin', you know where you can find me dead

 Got them Gucci locs fitted and the plastic on my lap
