Blinded by the light 
 Justice league (echos) 
 I risk it all for her 
 Give it all for her 
 Just to see her smile more 
 Remember the days when I didn't have her next to me 
 It's clear to see I'm in love boy I gotta be... 
 Open my eyes to the sunrise 
 Thinking bout life without my sunshine 
 Wipe my eyes 'cause I started crying 
 Baby girl you my better half, I'm on a different path 
 You should be happy I'm not on the air 
 Uh oh now she mad 
 Garbbing her louie bag cussin and fussin about how she ain't comin' back 
 As usual she over react 
 I'm just speaking my mind baby try to relax 
 She say 
 Well explain all these texts from your exes picture mail from your ex excreta den 
 I say 
 I can't explain what she do baby, I'm just focus on you baby, know I love you baby 
 I'm running out of words that express how I feel 
 You keep it so real I want a buy a spot just for us to chill 
 No neighbors just heels in the ocean air 
 Vacation there when the world start to stress us jea 
 But until then I be staring out my win-dow 
 Wishing that the life that we had never it thooo 
 Momma it might sound like game wedding rang but this time I ain't playing 
 Here what I'm saying 
 You looking at a better man a second chance 
 I thank you for that I thank you for that I was walking around dead 
 Till my life came back, true story my life came back
