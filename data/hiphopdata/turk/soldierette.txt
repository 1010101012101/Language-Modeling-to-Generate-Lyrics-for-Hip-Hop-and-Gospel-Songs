C'mon, c'mon, c'mon 
 C'mon, c'mon look, look... (Verse 1 - 
 Turk) 
 Verse one is about this chick named 
 Karen 
 She wanted to be down, I told her first she gotta run 
 Aaron I'ma give you the world, keep you shop everyday 
 Take this work downtown to this nigga named 
 Gary 
 Bring me back what I need, and I'ma make it happen I don't play 
 On tha real like a man, girl please believe me 
 Look here I'm a man by my words 
 Nigga try to jack you I leave his brains in the curb 
 You get my back, I get yours that's how we play it 
 Got the got the job done before you get pay I know you done heard you gotta work before you eat 
 Either you do it or don't it's all cool with me 
 'Cause I'm straight look here you try to get where I'm at 
 Do it right the first time, and I'ma holla back 
 But 
 Look I ain't making you, it's all on you 
 Wanna be in that limelight it's what you gotta do (Chorus - repeat 2X) 
 She'll drive from state to state, and bring her nigga the pound 
 A soldierette'll down whatever it take to be down 
 A real soldierette'll hold the thangs off in here purse 
 She'll let you use her house, so you can hide the work (Verse 2 - 
 Turk) 
 Verse two is about this hot girl named 
 Tasha 
 Great big fine with ass, just like her momma 
 Tasha wanted to be a superstar I heard 
 Willin' to do anything now tell me is that nerve 
 All that shit not even cost for 
 Wodie she trippin' 
 All that just to be a rapper 
 Wodie she trippin' 
 Better open your eyes before it's to late 
 You better dream quickly with that look in your face 
 Then what'cho gonna do, better listen to my advice I'm only gonna speak once, lil' momma not twice 
 Nigga don't give a fuck about you but say they do 
 Fall for it if you want, 
 Boo it's on you 
 Playin' to the end look that how you do his ass 
 Look is what you do make you think that your green is grass 
 Don't be a duck, just to get what you want (Chorus - repeat 2X) 
 If is for you, 
 It's gonna happen you just wait till it come 
 A soldierette'll down whatever it take to be down 
 She'll let you use her house, so you can hide tha work 
 She'll drive from state to state, and bring her nigga the pound 
 A real soldierette'll hold the thang off in here purse 
 Verse three I'ma get it all with 
 Kitty (Verse 3 - 
 Turk) 
 A good cool trick who we use the house when we needed 
 To get our shine on, and our name to be mention 
 Only thing she wanted is alittle bit attention 
 We'll we do that for you look that ain't 'bout nothin' 
 Gotta keep your mouth close and don't say nothin' 
 Let us run shoot all day and all night 
 We gonna play it down tha middle do a favor for a favor 
 Mind your own business and it gonna be all right 
 You get what you want as long as I get my paper 
 This gotta be my hustla spot and only my shop 
 If they ain't breaking you off like him breaking you off 
 All that other traffic you got, 
 Kitty it gotta stop 
 Let 'em know they gotta go respect your call 
 These days niggas not giving us nothin' free I know the game cold, but look that's how it be (Chorus - repeat 2X) 
 A soldierette'll down whatever it take to be down 
 She'll drive from state to state, and bring her nigga the pound 
 A real soldierette'll hold the thang off in here purse 
 She'll let you use her house, so you can hide tha work
