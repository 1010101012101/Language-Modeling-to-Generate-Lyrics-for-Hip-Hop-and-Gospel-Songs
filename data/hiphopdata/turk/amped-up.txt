Step in the club with my air force ones 
 In the back of my bub, I got air force dones 
 Full of that red, white, and blue I'm amped up 
 Fake buckin if you want, you gone get stamped up 
 You gone get these ten in a halves all in yo face 
 We gone take it outside and you gone be a case 
 You gettin' ya grace won't live another day 
 I take this time to fault, time to shoot off your way 
 Ain't worried 'bout the charge 'cause I got the dream team 
 Money, power, respect lil nigga feel me 
 I'm a soldier 5'11 from magnolia 
 Look, don't talk I'll show ya 
 You with yo boys look I'm by myself 
 You talkin' noise look that's bad for your health 
 Look, that's no good, can't do from the hood 
 We don't roll like that 
 Homie out of order, homie get it crackin' 
 You full of that red, white, and blue and you amped up 
 Homie buckin if he want, Homie get stamped up 
 You full of that absolut you amped up 
 Homie buckin if he want, Homie get stamped up 
 If you full of that henny and you amped up 
 Homie buckin if he want, Homie get stamped up 
 You done had one too many and you amped up 
 Homie buckin if he want, Homie get stamped up 
 I tote gats, got stacks, stay in all black 
 Hope that you that I'm quick to bust back 
 Sell crack, flip that, sometimes I jack 
 Real niggaz I run with dog bitches I smack 
 Dog hoes, wear bauds, tee's and ree's 
 Do shows, blow joe's, weed indeed 
 Hit dro's, spit flow, represent that three 
 Break bread, bitch no, gets nothin' from me 
 Fucc with Annie, off Second indeed 
 Bout my fatty, nicca cheese and cream 
 Fuck my daddy, he did nothing for me 
 Just bought a caddy, put it on 23's 
 I'm a stunna, a repper, look I'm ballin bitch
