Listen you might learn sumthin 
 Uh uh come on come on uh yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Come on come on uh huh come on look look 
 Ma I understand why you used to be so hard 
 Kept me inside from catchin a charge 
 From day one you always said I ain't had no boyz 
 Told me to go to church and learn about the law 
 Ya never... told me wrong but you told me right 
 Said the streets wasn't fo me and I'll lose my life 
 Look here I luv u 4 dat datz why I'm here today 
 And I luv u 4 dat look I mean wat I say 
 I don't know wat I woulda done without u 
 I woulda run wid a gun probally without u 
 You my girl you my doll you my best friend 
 I can depend on you mama again and again 
 You never let me down no matter wat it is 
 Don't got no where to go you would give me a place to live 
 And it's like that that's why I luv you girl 
 I would never put no one above ya girl 
 You used to make me punch da clock (I luv u 4 dat) 
 I couldn't hit da block (I luv u 4 dat) 
 Stayed in when it was hot (look here I luv u 4 dat look ma I luv u 4 dat I luv you for dat) 
 I can never pay you back for all the things you done 
 But I do appriciate all the things you done 
 Takin' care of 3 sons all by urself 
 U was da daddy and da mama you ain't have no help 
 When times was ruff fo us you got us through da sturggle 
 U taught us how to luv one an other and be brothaz 
 Jus a single parent livin' in da bricks 
 Livin' off welfare food stamps and wicks 
 It was hard back then look I ain't gon lie 
 Go to skoo then be back in before 89 
 Ma how you did I don't think I coulda done it 
 Gotta give you ya props u a strong black woman 
 Look I luv dat women and I mean everythang 
 When I say she mean everythang I mean everythang 
 And imma respect her till she dead 'n' gone 
 I luv you for dat dats why I wrote this song 
 See when you go to jail mom still be there 
 She might trip a lil while but believe she care 
 Always by ya side dawg when you got no one else 
 Even if you hurt mom she'll still be there 
 I don't know no body who play it like that 
 If ya wrong or ya right mama got ya back 
 She 100 wid me she'll never turn her back on me 
 I let her know everythang 'cause itz like she my hommie 
 I luv dis fam wid all my heart 
 I don't think dat can even take us apart 
 And dats on da real dawg that's the way I feel 
 I luv you 4 dat and I'm just keepin' it real 
 And nothin' or no one cna steal that luv 
 Tha luv dat I have for my mama 
 Come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on
