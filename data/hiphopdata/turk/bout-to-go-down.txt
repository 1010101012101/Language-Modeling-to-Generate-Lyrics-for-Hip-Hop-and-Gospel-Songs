 Off top, fuck it I show up at ya block and see

 And I pop, pop, pop out my pretty pink drop 
 Lil shop pumpin rocks up in the parkin lot 
 Pull up in the light, with a coupe 
 With a bag, matchin' my boots I ain't here to be cute, I'm here to bring the truth I know bitches be like, "she can't really fight 
 Ain't no ghetto in her", till I put the medal in her 
 But I gotta letcha bitches know exacly how I do 
 Take her, out of her misery, out of her hell, fuck 
 Shanelle 
 Shit, I'm down to bring couple of nails 
 Up-chick up before bullets start leakin I locked up and got my poker face on 
 Bitch I touch without reachin', huss you without speakin' 
 A.C. and the king, meet y'all jokers face on 
 Chumps get done fuckin' with the lady don 
 Take your arms leave reachless 
 Shit, I leave you speechless 
 Tryin' to take my mic 'cause he slapped you outta reflex (Chorus)

 Bitch nigga take that frown down, before we tear it down 
 Bring it cousin 'cause this gangsta shit should have been went down 
 In the club, high off that fire woodie 
 Right now, I guess it's bout time to holla woodie 
 Didn't a nigga like to tell ya dead sonny, hundred round 
 Uptown round, he gettin' in his car burn him down 
 Lay'em down, fuck over'em the nigga ain't nothin' but a clown 
 Shot callin, I never get my hands dirty 
 These hands were made for playin' hoes and cookin birdies 
 Dick 
 Clint, 
 Big 
 Chief,

 Off that bottle, I'm bad and I'm nervous 
 Everybody in the project know who choppin and who servin' 
 Cross the court, niggas whisperin and they nervous 
 Step up comin' home, pop a bottle, and cook a birdy 
 Don't get it twisted, it's 
 Cash 
 Money real estate 
 Platinum bullets, let his family see his fuckin' face (Chorus)
