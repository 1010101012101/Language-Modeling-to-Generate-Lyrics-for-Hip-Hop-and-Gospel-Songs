Mmm, mmm, c'monAh c'mon, c'mon, c'monC'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon 
 C'mon, c'mon, look, look (Verse One) 
 When I start to spray, clear the way, y'all get knocked 
 Cause once my thang cock, I then aim and pop 
 I'm a donkey wodie, a untamed gorillaWilder than will (?), T.C. representer 
 Known for spinnin Benz, gettin' about fifty 
 Plus I'm quick to ride, and give it to you snitches 
 I'm a no doubt fella, always have I always will 
 Uptown fella, young and thuggin' plus I'm real 
 In my blood in my veins it be the way that I be 
 All I know is killin', murder drama no peace 
 Young stud nineteen who got off the porch early 
 I done did it all believe dat, ya heard me 
 Whoever like testin look, don't you do it 
 'Cause I don't hesitate especially if you blew it 
 Your set I run - through it, like a mad man 
 Don't think I won't do it, leave your momma sad man (Chorus) 
 Look here - it's in me lil' wodie to be the thug that I be 
 It's in me lil' wodie to wear baguettes on Roley 
 It's in me lil' wodie to wear - T's, 'Baud's, and Ree's 
 It's in me lil' wodie - look here - it's in me lil' wodie (Verse Two) 
 It's in my bloodstream wodie, to be the type that I am 
 Sold gats split hash take a boy from his fam 
 Nothin' but streets, look - it's all that I know 
 Knockin' you off yo' feet, it's all that I know 
 Drivebys and pull-ups I'm prepared every dayThuggin as usual I do dat every day 
 Quick to roast ya, if you're not from round my way 
 In the middle of the quarter in one of them hallways 
 Quick to still ya yeah, I'm real I ain't fake 
 (?), A murder scene in the middle of yellow tape 
 Put a hole in your thinkin' cap, you won't be thinkin' no more 
 Look, you'll be put to napA youngster play it raw raw, and ask you out 
 Me and my dog Rat quick to run up in yo' house 
 Yeah I goes out 'cause it's in me lil' daddy 
 When it's a coke drought I tote a semi lil' daddy (Chorus) (Verse Three) 
 I'm the one they're talkin' about, original Hot Boy 
 Lil' Turk wodie, run up and get shot boy 
 With a long gun, I came with fifty rounds in it 
 Ain't gon' be nuttin nice, when I'm spinnin and bendin 
 Non-stop cousin, the chopper a fool yes 
 Get your mind right, that's what it do yesBlood and brains, all over the streets 
 Is what you see dawg, messin with meI'll do you somethin' awful split ya deep 
 Closed casket you had front you for your peeps 
 I get up then blast, somebody dyin' tonight 
 Load up the mac, look I'm ridin' tonightI disguise like a woman mask over my face 
 Gloves on my hand no evidence no case 
 That's how I do it, look, do it smart and smooth 
 If you don't want my trouble look, better be cool (Chorus)
