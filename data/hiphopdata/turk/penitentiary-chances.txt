 Every day all day on the block

 Pushing weight duckin' them poeple cause I know they gon'swang 
 7 days of the week I be on the grind 
 Stiking to the g-code gotta get it and shyne 
 Motherfuck the jakes stank bitches gotta catch me 
 As for the snakes niggaz please don't test me 
 Till the day they arrest me I'm huggin the block 
 Every day all day cause is money to cop' 
 Watch the cops sitting on 26's 
 Nice paintjob fully equiped with the kit 
 Nigga no such thang as a nine to five

 Cause I got my boss, call my own shots 
 Work my own hour while I was running my own shop

 Take it like a man and just accept my lick 
 Can cry like a bitch cause I made that bed 
 And I gotta lay in it you heard what I said

 And it never be a drought we keep it coming like sperm

 Hardhead would I ever learn hustle all I know 
 It's in my blood nigga get it from my kinfolk 
 Cause I was thought to from the narcs when they come 
 Brake yo gates get away when they come 
 Taking chances is something that I gotta do 
 Go to jail make bail back to doing what I do 
 Till the day they lay me down I'm a hit the block 
 It's slang clock run back n get paid keep doing my fucken thang 
 N you can take that to the bank and cash it
