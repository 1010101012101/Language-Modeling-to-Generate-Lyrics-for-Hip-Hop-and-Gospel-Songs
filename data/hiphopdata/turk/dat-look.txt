 C'mon, c'mon, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga 
 (Uh huh) 
 C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, look, look, look 
 I thought you was my number one bitch but I was wrong 
 I was tripping, I had to be stone for pones 
 I'm out my mind thinking you gon' just my time 
 But when I, when I went up that road you gon' stop the crying 
 I heard that I caught five but I gave it back 
 When I touch down, bitch, I'm gon' pay you back 
 I'ma fuck all you friends, all you close of kin 
 Go back to being a straight pitch again 
 Put that steering wheel in your back, ride you, bitch 
 And I could give a fuck if you're crying, bitch 
 I'ma give you something dirty, I'ma have the last laugh 
 I put that on my life, I'ma have the last laugh 
 Try to blues me but the tables turned 
 And it stopped on me, bitch, you gon' learn 
 Played with a Hot Boy, you gon' burn, baby, burn 
 Head don't smoke like we just hit shern 
 Bitch, you gon' have that dick look

 Oh, yeah, oh, yeah 
 Now this little dame must have misplaced her brain 
 Switching up without the slightest little trace of shame 
 Since Bubba K became a heavily stated name 
 She's thinking my dang-a-lang is a ride on the gravy train 
 I certainly ain't a lame, little Betty, you misguided 
 'Cause it's rubles, not noodles that gets me excited 
 Ain't never seen shit like it a fisher done been dyking 
 Since Clinton was the Pres, now 'tending she meant like it 
 Now slut, you got something to tell me, "Oh, wow, what?" 
 You always loved Andy, cooled Olie and mowed up 
 I'll oblige and give you a ride but the only prize 
 You receiving is what I'm squeezing out on your chalky thighs 
 Oh, these five dudes standing behind me, don't mind them 
 But if it's fucking we discussing, just know they gon' chime in 
 But that shouldn't be an issue, you love me, don't get shook 
 Stupid whore, that's what you get for giving that dick look 
 (Uh, oh) 
 Bitch, you gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Bitch, you gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Bitch, you gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Bitch, you gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Bitch, I'm home now and I'm back on my feet 
 Back to the same Turk that I used to be 
 You can get off my dick, bitch, stop sweating my balls 
 'Cause it wasn't all that when I was behind the wall 
 Bitch, now you want me behind ya, I don't want have none 
 You did a dirty deed, bitch, you played me sour 
 You left me stranded like Gilligan 
 To be honest with you, bitch you, was killin' me 
 But I'ma dog like 'Blue's Clues' 
 You did that, bitch, well, watch how I do you 
 I'ma put you on cruise control 
 Full speed, bitch, you stanky ho 
 It's a must that you feel my pain and hurt, bitch 
 'Cause the name of my game is Eagle first, bitch 
 I'ma fool, you started and I'm gon' finish it 
 Two can play at that game but watch who win it, bitch 
 (Bitch) 
 Bitch, you gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Bitch, you gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Bitch, you gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Gon' have that dick look 
 Bitch, you gon' have that dick look

 Look, I don't know what's wrong with these hoes, man 
 Niggaz gon' get in their jokes and these hoes go south 
 Like Casper, you know what I'm saying? 
 It's all gravy though, these stupid ass hoes just don't know 
 Bitch talking 'bout, she can't pay her bills 
 Know what I'm saying? 
 And why she only fucked one but nigga 
 It's all gravy, bitch, don't have to send me no letters 
 You heard me, I'ma Hot Boy
