You can't tell me I'm not tryin' to be part of society, you can't tell me I ain't give it a shot 
 You can't say I ain't at least try to be all of the normal things that girls sposed to brought 
 Up to be but look at the fuckery all these rappers are bringin' to y'all 
 Now you better hold up for the ride of your life when I slide in the game I'm motherfucking goin' off 
 I been waitin' to let go. and I really gotta admit I know that I been doin' a great job 
 I came to disinfect yo, little memory bank of the basicest shit the game got 
 I came to disconnect yo headphones so you let go of the dumb shit been taught 
 Like that I gotta sell sex because males get upset if I don't sell show and bear it all 
 Eff that no scratch that fuck that shit 
 Get back ho back back what's up with 
 This lack of rap tracks that make some sense 
 I ain't talkin' 'bout conscious rap but oh shit 
 How many people ballin', but the economy fucked 
 How many people all up in dope n they sell drugs 
 If it's every single rapper who buyin' the dope huh? 
 But why your baby hella dirty n u froze up 
 Please quit with the act OK I'll go first 
 We gon' be bringin' it back and I'm a say it all in one verse 
 Beans gon' be spilled out the bag, and maybe a couple of feelings will get hurt 
 So if you ain't got thick skin bitch, you better get in your little bubble and kick rubble or kick dirt 
 See I'm tired of all of this internet talk, 'cause of internet balls, in your internet drawls 
 On some internet blogs, talkin' internet fraud 
 With anonymous comments you probably aren't 
 Even close to cool, or you failed ass artist 
 Probably got shut when you started 
 And now you wanna talk about shit 'cause you just aren't 
 Any where close to being what you wanted 
 If you don't like something why do you comment? 
 Why you all up in it and why you watch it? 
 And why would you gossip, about all this nonsense? 
 It's funny cause lately men be obnoxious 
 Really? You mean to tell you think that I don't know that I ain't black? 
 Or that I don't know that usually Latin girls ain't really been all up in rap 
 I didn't know that my color or gender can be the preventer of gettin' on tracks 
 Well really it's not, it's just a couple ignorant basic-ass people that say that 
 But they all wack and they got no swag and they all probably live with their mom and dad 
 And they probably broke and they got no chance 
 To ever do be doin' what I'm doin' and that's sad 
 Cause last time I checked they play Hip Hop in the hood 
 And I dare you to find a hood with no Latins in it because I don't think that you could 
 See last time that I checked they play Hip Hop in the hood
