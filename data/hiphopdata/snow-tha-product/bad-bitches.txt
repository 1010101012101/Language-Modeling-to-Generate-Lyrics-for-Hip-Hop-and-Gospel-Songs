 Young mami, flyer than a bitch 
 I'm a deal's home-run, don't need to slide in the shit 
 They can't stop me and its obviously 
 'Cause I just hop up in the booth to show them monsters exist 
 I never brag about shit but Imma brag about tonight 
 I got all the bottles coming and I'm stunting out of spite 
 Cause these bitches keep on thinking they not finna see me shine 
 Bitch, I just spent 'bout 30 racks like it ain't shit so fuck your life 
 I'm saying uh, who you think brought up all these chicks? 
 I'm saying uh, who you think handling her biz? 
 I got a buzz, probably make me harder than I rip up any track 
 And still I ain't gotta show my ass or show you shit
