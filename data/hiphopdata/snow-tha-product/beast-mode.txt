No snooze I'm about to wake 'em up 
 'Cause they say they married to the game well I'm about to break 'em up 
 'Cause I got that loud bang 
 Hit 'em in the brain I'm running up in this bitch like bam 
 The rap game will never be the same there's a lil chick killin' every man 
 I'm in muthafuckin beastmode she's cold 
 Snows got bars to spare y'all bitches been sleep though we woke 
 I'm in cali I'mma put it in the air and I'mma run up 'cause I never been scared 
 Little mami with a heart of a California bear 
 I'mma come through murderin bitches 
 I know you heard that I'm spittin' a little better everybody is scared 
 They call me snow I go imma beauty and a beast 
 I got the coast you know I'm the best everybody finna see 
 I put on for mine from the west to the east down south no doubt they done heard about me 
 I'm a latin chick spittin' out here making a killin' as a lyrical villan I r.i.p. beats 
 I was gone but I'm back like ooh miss snow tha product wrecks 
 You can check my stats I don't lose if you thought I was done not yet 
 Oh shit I bet little chicks upset that I get my bread and I get respect 
 And they mad that I been the best no less the west gon get 
 This chick here wrecks
