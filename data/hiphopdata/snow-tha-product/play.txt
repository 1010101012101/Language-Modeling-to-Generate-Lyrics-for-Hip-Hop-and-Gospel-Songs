This ones for y'all if y'all want it 
 This one for la raza, bitch it don't stop 
 Till 4, 5, 6 in the mornin' 
 Till somebody's uncle sings till he drops 
 Now I rap for y'all and y'all know it 
 But goddamn, do I got that hatin' shit 
 Maybe 'cause I'm Mexican n I be wreckin' 
 She steppin' and definitely bringin' 'em a little change to this 
 Man, I come from where they run from 
 'Cause this ain't a sap and the pesos don't last us shit 
 A conundrum, I've been dumb some 
 Man, I'm proud of my people who be tryna get like Carlos Slim 
 'Cause I know y'all tired of bein pacifist 
 I'm running up with hella cats and I'm blasting shit 
 Till we back, we get attack and attack you bitch 
 'Cause if you tryna fuck with us then you a masochist 
 Mira cabron, conmigo no te metas guey 
 Yo te voy a ense√±ar que conmigo no es okay 
 Poneme algun commentario que el ritmo es gay 
 Que no mato la liga con mi mixtape 
 There's always some dumb bitch with some shit to say 
 But a latina finna get up in here an hit the game 
 So you can hate, you can say shit but we gon' stay 
 Snow White tell them hating bitches fix your face 
 We rolling up, holding drinks 
 Let them haters hate 
 They know what's up, know we in here 
 They know we don't play, don't play 
 Don't play, don't play, don't play 
 Hold up, wait a minute, make them scream 'n' shake 
 We showing up, blowing up 
 Tell my DJ hit play, hit play 
 Hit play, hit play, hit play 
 (Wake ya game up!) 
 This one for the kickbacks in apartments 
 Man, fuck the neighbors and fuck the cops 
 If they don't want none, don't talk shit 
 From the VIP in the club to the parking lot 
 I got a crew of belligerents, that's unorthodox 
 And it all went downhill when we poured them shots 
 We poured one, four, six, twenty, fuck 
 I can't even afford it all 
 Around here these bouncers don't play 
 Been drinking Monster all day 
 Feel big as Ricky Rozay 
 But I'm five-foot-three on a good day 
 Ok, I'm feeling Patron ay pero dice mi novia to phone home 
 But my girl here telling me don't go 
 Pitbull in the back like bon bo-bon bon 
 Like where my fellas in here getting stacks? Throw em 
 Where my women in here with the racks? Show 'em 
 What you doing in the back? Where you going? 
 Haters talking, stepping, it's a rap, hold up 
 We rolling up, holding drinks 
 Let them haters hate 
 They know what's up, know we in here 
 They know we don't play, don't play 
 Don't play, don't play, don't play 
 Hold up, wait a minute, make them scream 'n' shake 
 We showing up, blowing up 
 Tell my DJ hit play, hit play 
 Hit play, hit play, hit play 
 (Wake ya game up!)
