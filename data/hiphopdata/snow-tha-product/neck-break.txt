I make their neck break, that's why they jock 
 I make they neck break, that's why they jock 
 And I make they boyfriends spend cake, so hoes can stop 
 I can make their neck break in the parking lot 
 Got Chevy capris on 26's, that's hot 
 Two-two toned candy, yeah, you know you married 
 Staring at Miss Snow asking can he have me 
 I make they neck break, that's why they jock 
 I make they neck break when the music stops (Damn!) 
 I make my own cake so he can't get rides 
 And he ain't got his hustle up and he ain't about that life 
 I think I speak for all my girls when I say that if he broke 
 And he walk up trying to holler then oh yeah the answer's NO! 
 I work too damn hard to make my own cash 
 I got my own stash, and I'm bout my own stats 
 I make my own racks so I never ever crash 
 Then I spend some dollars and I know I'll make them mad 
 I make your man break, and go 'head and ask him 'bout it 
 Watch you (?) and I enter when you doubt it 
 Snow White Tha Product, also known as the baddest 
 As I'm passing, asking, put him in the pen for romancing 
 You hating 'cause I'm killing game 
 And I make money off that white girl like Billy Ray 
 Walk up in the middle of the club like yeah I know they feeling me 
 This is just hustling girls are flipping (?) (Heeey! Fuck that!) 
 Stepping in the scene, slim chick, shades on, and dressed in Louis V 
 And everybody wanna know what's up and who she be 
 Guess who haters?! it's no one else but me, me, me 
 I (I) am (am) fresher than a lettuce, come check out the karots 
 I make them haters jealous 
 Walk up and they yelling 'cause they know I always wreck it 
 I get stages, its amazing how I blaze it, and then break the mic
