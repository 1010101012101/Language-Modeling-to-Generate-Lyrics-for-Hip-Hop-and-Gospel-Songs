Look, yo, yo 
 Man I used to pray for this 
 Got bullshit and then played for this 
 Never thirsty for fame and shit 
 But I wanna buy mommy a crazy crib 
 Finally get paid for shit 
 I've been doing "for free" for long 
 I would get up before dawn 
 Man I had like 3 or 4 jobs 
 And the shows be aight, gonna need time 
 Gonna work hard, but I be fine 
 Gonna go far, never rewind 
 Snow gonna get paid for these lines 
 Bitch I'm dope, and I'm gonna let these haters know 
 Uh, look 
 'Cause I done came up off rap 
 Trade racks for riches 
 85 Cadillac, man this shit switching 
 But the only thing the same is how I feel 
 All these things done changed but we still real 
 I be with the same kids from when I started out 
 Y'all ain't gotta ask already know what I'm about 
 Man I'm just siding with my team, siding with my team 
 Same ones that believe, same ones that believe 
 Man I used to run around 
 With all the crew that I run with now 
 We went through broke days and got no pay 
 Tell Atlantic to budge it out 
 Been a couple folks on my payroll 
 We been woke y'all just ain't know 
 Been more than flow, it's been more than clothes 
 It's more than just Snow, this shit about hope 
 Cause you said that hard work pays 
 So we worked all night, all day 
 And you said all work, no play 
 And we listen now that shit changed 
 Now they say the game about luck 
 Now they tryna tell me I'm stuck 
 Now you tryna have me go back to the fans I earned tell 'em I fucked up (fuck no) 
 Before we get cut, we get cut throat 
 'Cause I'm keeping up with these uploads 
 As long we've been us, people up after us so we keeping it hondo 
 'Cause I bought my dads dream car and I'm lane switchin' 
 Same fam, same clan, same fans, making it, look 
 I be with the same kids from when I started out 
 Y'all ain't gotta ask already know what I'm about 
 Man I'm just siding with my team, siding with my team 
 Same ones that believe, same ones that believe
