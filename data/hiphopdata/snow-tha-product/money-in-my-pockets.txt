(Intro: Mr. Kee) 
 Yes, I really do be making money of this pimp shit, my nigga 
 And yes, I really do be making money of this rap shit, my nigga 
 And yes, I will fuck you up if you step to me wrong, my nigga 
 So fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you, you're cool 
 But fuck you, you, and you, haha, stop coming at me with that bullshit, man 
 (Verse 1: Mr. Kee) 
 Stop asking questions about the things I've done 
 The people I know, the places I go, and the hoes I meet 
 Especially when I'm bossing, approach with caution when I'm in the streets 
 And, homie, if you're close enough to speak but not to touch 
 Click, clack, click, clack, get back, when the .44 bust you can feel the adrenaline rush 
 We from the Bay, my niggas, so run your scrape away 
 I see that chain is so icy, how much you pay for that? 
 Shit, get your banana split, hit 'em up with the banana click 
 Gorillas ain't fucking with chimps, squares ain't fucking with pimps 
 In the club with a mean mug, nigga pulled up like I ain't got shit to live for 
 One minute I'm cool, next minute I flip while the bitch leave on tip-toes 
 I'm on that 'Grind me everyday' living hustle I get paid 
 Shit is paper chasing pimping and busting so fuck a 9-5 
 See, 24/7 that's my business hours 
 I'm half black and half amazing, after money and power 
 You best respect a boss, better leve soon 'cause he's about to spray shit 
 I got a different car, so I ain't got to say shit 
 I got money in my pockets so I ain't got to say shit (x3) 
 Ask me how much motherfucker that's gay shit 
 I got money in my pockets so I ain't got to say shit (x3) 
 Flip them haters off and blast off in my spaceship 
 (Verse 2: Snow Tha Product) 
 Guess who, bitch?! Born in the Bay but I live down in the south 
 It's an itty bitty little 5'2" chick with the world going like what now 
 My style precise, got a mouthpiece like a politician 
 Tell me what you want, whatever you want to, give it to them whatever the fuck I'm wishing 
 What is it? I'm busy, don't question how I'm living 
 Don't ask what all this costs, 'cause I done bought them all in one visit 
 I'm Snow Tha Product, the west coast Wonder Woman 
 So don't get mad because your boyfriend had my slappers bumping 
 Because I kick it with the click that got them comfort dumping 
 And plus I'm one chick that be cocky 'cause I come from nothing 
 The queen bee around this bitch, see my block is buzzing 
 I roll a 'piff because if haters see my rock, they bugging 
 See time spent hustling is never time wasted 
 Time spent busting is definitely gay shit 
 So don't worry what I make and how I make it 
 I'm a rapper, drop it or lock it, I ain't gotta say shit 
 (Outro: Mr. Kee x2) 
 Gimme that, gimme that, I ain't gotta ask twice 
 Gimme that shit, I give no fuck about the damn price 
 See y'all been hating for nothing, so here's a reason now 
 See y'all been hating for nothing, so here's a reason now
