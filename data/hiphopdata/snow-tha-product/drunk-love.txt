Now I'm on the phone talkin' with you. 
 'Cause I'm drunk and I miss you. 
 And I know we have issues 
 But I called to say "What's up" and "What you doin'? 
 Who you there with? 
 Would you like me to come over..." 
 And remind you how we fell in drunk love 
 Okay we had a fight, so what? 
 Don't act like you never done me wrong, hold up, 
 So I got mad and I called the tow truck 
 And it ended up costin' you 454 bucks 
 But umm. You should've not yelled like that 
 And you know me, you know that I'll be yellin' right back 
 You know what I'm about and you know where my minds at. 
 And if you wanna disrespect me then I'm gonna fight back 
 But anyway yes I hit the club 
 And anyway yes I did get buzzed, 
 And anyway yes I thought about stuff, 
 And I realized I think I'm a little messed up 
 'Cause I drank 5 shots, cause my girls said "eff him" 
 Girl you don't need him if he gon' be disrespectin' 
 Girl you did right and hopefully ya man learns a lesson 
 I'm like "Yeah! Wait a second..." 
 Now I'm on the phone talkin' with you. 
 'Cause I'm drunk and I miss you. 
 And I know we have issues 
 But I called to say "What's up" and "What you doin'? 
 Who you there with? 
 Would you like me to come over..." 
 And remind you how we fell in drunk love 
 Okay... Don't hang up 
 I know we do this a lot but wait up 
 I thought about it and I ain't wanna break up 
 And I was thinkin' maybe I can stop by later 
 And I can make you feel the same way 
 'Cause I know you got me feelin' crazy, 
 You got me back and forth and my last resort is to drink and that just ain't me 
 And I know we argue 
 But I been trying not to call you 
 And it's been roller-coaster ride, and it got a lot worse when I was at the club and then saw you 
 So now I'm back to this, after I've been drinkin' 
 Back to you and I'm losin' my inhibitions, 
 Maybe I shouldn't have called it like this. But I'm drunk and I been thinkin'... 
 Now I'm on the phone talkin' with you. 
 'Cause I'm drunk and I miss you. 
 And I know we have issues 
 But I called to say "What's up" and "What you doin'? 
 Who you there with? 
 Would you like me to come over..." 
 And remind you how we fell in drunk love 
 I'm in this punch drunk love 
 So I had to call so I could say "What's up?" 
 I'm trying to figure out if we could chill (if we could chill) 
 If we could chill (if we could chill) 
 If we could chill (if we could chill) 
 If we could chill 
 Now I'm on the phone talkin' with you. 
 'Cause I'm drunk and I miss you. 
 And I know we have issues 
 But I called to say "What's up" and "What you doin'? 
 Who you there with? 
 Would you like me to come over..." 
 And remind you how we fell in drunk love 
 Punch drunk love 
 Punch drunk love
