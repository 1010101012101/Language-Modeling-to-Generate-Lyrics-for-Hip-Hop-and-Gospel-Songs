When they play my song, they gonn run it back 
 And when you see me then you knowing where the party at 
 Career win, full circle like I call the sacks 
 To all my high-school haters I've been heart attacks 
 Cause boy I come through, riding in a brontosaurus 
 And I drink a little liquor cause I'm out here touring 
 Pass out, so drunk, motherfuckers snorin 
 Bitches mouth stay runnin so I call em forest 
 Cause we got fucked up, girls roll the tourist 
 You would think by now we would act mature 
 But fcuk that, yup yap in a bitch it's [?] 
 I don't never give appology I [?] reportin 
 To the shots I took and the lines you snorted 
 I find myself funny but I find you worrying 
 Now catch myself runnin to a flight that's boarding 
 But hey, good nights and bad mornings 
 But hey, good nights and bad mornings 
 Hey, good nights and bad mornings 
 Mornin, mornin, mornin, mornin 
 Let's get drunk, so we can't get blamed for shit 
 Take hela shots till we get the hang of it 
 A bunch of free bottles, ain't no sense in wastin it 
 We be drinkin hela hennesy and blazin it 
 With hela white boys like josh and jacob shit 
 See this is what you living like when you be makin it 
 Some people like you and some people be fake and shit 
 But free week mean free blunts to the face again 
 I'm going outta this world and I'm back in orbit 
 I be getting lifted and the weed's my forklift 
 We got hela substance and you can't control it 
 I be spittin hela game cause I never forfeit 
 I be spillin hela beer on my fuckin jordans 
 Woke up with a mess that I can't afford it 
 My camera man hovered and he still recording 
 Go ahead, get this, good nights and bad mornings 
 Good nights and bad mornings, good nights and bad mornings 
 Go ahead, get this, good nights and bad mornings 
 Good nights and bad mornings, good nights and bad mornings 
 Let's make a bong out of water bottle 
 Cause I ain't bring a pipe but I brought pot though 
 And the drugs in my rooms I feel like a capo 
 We in traphouse, but I'm a start a sideshow 
 Attention all you haters, get upon your job though 
 I been makin money and I'm like que passo 
 You supposed to be stoppin it but I guess you not so 
 Good at what you doin cause I'm getting mars dough 
 I'm a drive to tijuana just to buy some tacos 
 Cause I'm on every color and I got the passport 
 I got my reggie wanna but you walkin out mode 
 Cause you hela fried so of course we not close 
 Me and my game tight like a fuckin corset 
 We get turn together and we hit them stores then 
 We can buy whatever, cause no money shortage 
 Now we have to pay for lugagge when our flight is boarding 
 But hey, good nights and bad mornings.
