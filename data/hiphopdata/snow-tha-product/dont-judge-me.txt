Light skinned long hair se√±orita 
 Rolling up sativa 
 Finally in the lime light 
 Slice limes and tequila 
 Living like can you keep up 
 I'm on the beach in rosaIita 
 Yup I got my feet up 
 You wanna see then pull a seat up 
 'Cause we bout to eat good 
 We been working for the past years 
 Life's about to have to pay me 
 Back for the past tears 
 Passing cashiers all of 
 My Visa cards 
 I hand my momma hella bags 
 And tell her these are yours 
 Now we afford to buy 
 Cause of my weeks of tours 
 Are having to pay me back 
 Cause yes I need couture 
 Now I need you boys to know 
 You can keep the whores 
 'Cause I ain't looking for a man 
 I make g's galore 
 Please don't judge me 
 No Please don't say you love me 
 (I'm young and I'm dumb and I'm turning up Turning up turning up) [x2] 
 I came back from quite the hiatus 
 Yeah I had them waiting counted out 
 But I came around 
 I'm saying hi to you haters 
 'Cause I'm bout to make it 
 About to take it to the majors 
 Man I'm tired of playing 
 I'm tired of having to being patient 
 We bout to eat good no more struggling now 
 We buzzin in town 
 My cousin and my brother been down 
 To run for the crown 
 We bout to make 'em woke if they sleeping 
 Coming for y'all 
 We bout to make a toast to the weekend 
 'Cause I got me a check with my name on top 
 (Man I got a check with my name on top) 
 I'm bout to make it happen for the kids on the block 
 Cause the turn up don't stop yeah it don't stop tell em 
 Please don't judge me 
 No Please don't say you love me 
 (I'm young and I'm dumb and I'm turning up turning up turning up) [x2]
