I might pour some drink up on the low (I'm drinking now) 
 I might pop a bar up on the low (I'm singing now) 
 I might get fucked up until I'm gone (I'm faded) 
 Why the fuck y'all care 'bout what I'm on? 
 They try to say I got a problem 
 I cut them bitches off (You know I cut them bitches off) 
 They try to say I got a problem 
 I cut them bitches off (You know I cut them bitches off) 
 So what if I stay faded 
 I know it's wrong 
 Don't say it, I got control 
 'Cause what the fuck you've done for me to talk about my life? 
 I've being doing too many wrongs, ain't might just make a right 
 Everybody wanna talk shit 
 How all of a sudden everybody got opinions about a bitch 
 Now they wanna tell me how it is 
 Kinda funny, pretty sure I'm sure you still be chillin' at the crib 
 You ain't put in work as hard as this 
 I've been putting work in while you hoes been sleeping in 
 Now I'm off touring, bitches wanna say some shit 
 Yeah you've got your two cents but bitch you need to get a grip 
 Shit 
 I'm drinking now 
 I'm singing now 
 I'm drinking now 
 I'm singing
