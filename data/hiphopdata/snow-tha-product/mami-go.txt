Walk in, club packed, and I'm feeling myself 
 Young chick look good from my hair to my nails 
 Everybody staring seems to know me quite well 
 'Cause I'm looking so hot, you boys' ice might melt 
 Plus I heard you boy like it when I'm speaking Spanish 
 Got him on the wall, hoping he can handle it 
 He know no one does it better than a Latin chick 
 So when I drop it, the situation gets hazardouz 
 I said: "Mira, yo se que te gusto 
 Asi te sugero pon tu cuerpo en buen uso 
 Yo se que nadie bail mejor, te lo juro" 
 So I dropped it, and everybody yelled "Tubo!" 
 Mira mijo, mira lo que digo 
 I already tod you I can drop it asta el piso 
 This Latina señorita hit the scene up 
 Making heat up whenever she be repping with estilo 
 He like it when I'm speaking Spanish, so he's after me 
 Amigs got the whole club, no one's hot as me 
 From the shoes to the purse, I'm so fine it hurts 
 And I know what I'm worth, no apologies 
 Look at mami go (when I walk in the door) 
 Look at mami go (when I step on the floor) 
 Look at mami go (when I put it on a mic what I meant he started hyperventilating when I got low) 
 Yo se que se emocionocuando entre yo al antro 
 Quiere conocerme y conversarr por buen rato 
 Quiere platicar pero yo quiero bailar 
 Y si me quieren criticar, ay porfavor ni al caso 
 Yo soy la mera mera la mejor de las raperas 
 Que se oponga la que quiera yo líricamente mato 
 Pues a mi me vale con que el DJ diga dale 
 Porque todo el mundo sabe que soy la reina del rap, yo 
 I know he like it when I roll my r's 
 He said he ain't never kicked it with a real star 
 Said I go hard, can I meet him at the bar 
 'Cause he wanna take a lil trip in his car 
 I said "Slow down boy, you need to stop but please.." 
 'Cause I ain't even known him for 10 minutes and he already jacking me 
 (Post Verse) 
 When I step in the club, all the dudes turn they heads 
 And their girls wanna slap they face 
 Cause shoot I look good, no matter where I go 
 See, I ain't only pretty on MySpace 
 He want it 'cause I spit hot and heavy 
 I got you ready to quit 
 I drop it steady the top with plenty of chicks 
 They not that many that got the credit to spit 
 I rock, they're ready and talk, too many will flip 
 I know you know the flow will go to the peak 
 I throw them bows, bulldoze the hoes till they weak 
 I show to most the flow is pro when I speak 
 I grow some more get pros to work with when I speak 
 Now he want it 'cause he told me so 
 He said he never been with a Latin chick that flow before 
 So he said "what'd it do?", I showed him what's the biz 
 He wanted to give me the ring and want me to have his kids 
 I said "Slow down boy, you need to stop but please.." 
 'Cause I ain't even known him for 10 minutes and he already jacking me
