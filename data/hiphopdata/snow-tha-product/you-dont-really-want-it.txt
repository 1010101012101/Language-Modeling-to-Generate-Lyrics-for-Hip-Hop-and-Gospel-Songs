Listen to me, learn from me 
 I wasn't the best because I killed quickly 
 I was the best because the crowd loved me 
 Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom 
 I will win the crowd 
 I'll give them something they've never seen before 
 Look, I ain't play games, homie, I ain't got time 
 Especially when I do this for my homies that done got time 
 Imma do this for the city, every hot line 
 Go to every block, every hood, every corner, every stop-sign 
 I just wanna get it for the days that I was living in the hood 
 Wait a minute, I don't even know if you can call it living 
 Pay attention, cause at any given minute 
 You be chilling with your niggas and be witness to a killing, ho 
 Grew up on the north side, north side 
 Nigga to the fullest, I was quicker than a bullet 
 That was going past the window and saw nothing 
 And I'm coming for the crime, what the fuck you think I'm here for? 
 Make no mistake about it, fake shit I can't allow it 
 Trapped in this game, now I can't get out it 
 You want that real shit, and I feel the same about it 
 I was in the trenches just like you 
 Wondering how the fuck Imma get through 
 I don't have a plan, but I know one thing: 
 Gotta get up out of this motherfucker, and I can't lose 
 Eyes on the prize, and I know I can't quit 
 Never gonna fail, so I'm on my shit 
 Gotta keep going and I can't look back 
 Took on the world and now it's on my back, back 
 Back up, homie, don't act up 
 I'm from Fly City where this rap shit really ain't a factor 
 And when them kilos on your back and make a 
 Motherfucking backpacker pack up 
 On some other shit, them was the odds I was up against 
 So I ain't phased by none of this 
 Cause in reality, I love that shit 
 For all the grinding I was doing, I ain't no one you was fucking with 
 See, I've been on my hustle for a minute 
 Now it's really time to get it 
 So it's only fair I'm letting them know 
 That I'm a motherfucking animal, it's true 
 You don't want me coming for you 
 Just sit back and keep enjoying the show, cause yo 
 You don't really want it, nah 
 (Come and step to the floor, you already know 
 That I'm too cold with the microphone 
 I'm beastmode, better leave it alone) 
 You don't really want it, nah 
 ('Cause I came too far to stop 
 Regardless I'm off the wall, chip off the block 
 I'm a monster, watch bitch, better call the cops) 
 Welcome to the Hunger Games 
 You give up your whole life but get tons of fame 
 There's rappers who don't write but get companies 
 Making of with their souls for a chunk of change 
 I got more profits than those, y'all so dumb to chase 
 But they popped off all the time, but they a bum today 
 Man, I got that Glock that I tote make you cuff your chain 
 You see my pockets is gordo, you chubby chase? 
 I got a plot to take over this continent 
 While I'm over-thinking, all these bitches are there gossiping 
 So Imma take a spliff, take a hit, something monstrous 
 'Cause I really quit but I think I've been locked in 
 And all this bullshit and I'm sick of the politics 
 I'm gonna show you which really bitch but it's obvious 
 All of these hoes really want to just party and molly 
 And violence and bottles and popping and dropping 
 And opposite, that is just me, are you taunting them? 
 All they admire us, not in that guapa shit 
 Alternately, I think I'm gonna stop the gig 
 Talk to them, all bitches wearing this God-given 
 Oculus urge of confidence 
 I'm just subconscious shit trying to make all y'all get y'all bitches 
 Hearing my shit but I'm not spitting anymore lessons 
 Bae, do what you wish, I ain't gon' stress 
 Man, you finna get little Miss Snow from oh wait where I spit 
 All about selling drugs and the things that I did 
 'Cause I done sell 'tapes and I toured 
 And I ripped all these stages from East to the West 
 And these kids and these magazine covers just don't give a shit 
 What the fuck? You want Product? I'll give you a fix this is it 
 C-Webby be carnivorous, monstrous shit 
 I'm the boss, people be calling me Sarge in this bitch 
 Make a mess, gotta keep a fucking tarp and a whip 
 As I keep evolving, just as Darwin predicts 
 So it's off with his head and I'm off with his chick 
 Keep it calm till I flip then I'm off in this bitch 
 Fuck dawn of the dead 
 Shit I got grown men hiding under their bed 
 Thinking that monster exist 
 Cooking up that east coast dough 
 With a pad and a pen and the words that I wrote 
 Every syllable invented that's enclosed and in quotes 
 Are too complex for most folk, but you know 
 I'm a ghost in the booth, you can't see me dawg 
 Hard body with the flow, C3PO 
 Lost track of all the fuckin' Sour D we roll 
 So high, Major Tom can't reach me, bro 
 Shh, yo don't spend your time in, you don't really want it 
 So everybody suck my dick without a condom on it 
 I'm just full of that chronic, gin no tonic 
 Couple capsules in my pocket 
 Now I'm going rocket, feeling so right 
 Going psychotic, they feeling my rhymes 
 Sipping Hpnotiq, I'm losing my mind 
 Or break another time 'cause I'm just a little 
 Motherfucker with the coldest flow 
 CT to the Poconos, you better hold the phone 
 Before you leave with a broken nose 
 I'm so dope that I think I'm about to overdose 
 Now I feel like I'm really 'bout to go to a road 
 But it ain't chose by most man, so I go alone into the dark side 
 How could I have sold my soul? I never had one, bitch! 
 Motherfucker, let's go!
