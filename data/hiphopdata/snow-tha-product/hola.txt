Well if it ain't that hot spitta, guap getta, that's snow 
 All in the hospital they go 
 Hop in the Benz, Jetta or Rolls with a [?] I'm a kill em all slow 
 And I be walkin with a bunch of swag 
 Fuck that word, fuck, I'm back 
 She just like Kirko, yep it bangs 
 And I'm beatin' muthafuckas like a punching bag 
 When I walk up in the club and these boys wanna look pink 
 Wetter than a tub, and in time I'm rollin up 
 You can check on all my funds 
 And you know I'm comin' up 
 Cause I made a couple fuckin' hundred grand in a month 
 And I got the rubber bands that'll snap right back 
 And I got the upper hand cause I came right back 
 And like I never ever left cause I'm sick like that 
 Cali-swag with the pistol grip pump on my lap 
 Hola, hola, bitch que pasa, break out the patron and vodka 
 Hola, hola, bitch que pasa, break out the patron and vodka 
 Hola, hola, bitch que pasa, break out the patron and vodka 
 Tron and vodka, bitch que pasa, break out the patron and vodka 
 Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up in my cup 
 Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up in my cup 
 Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up 
 Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up in my cup 
 Yo, um, um, hola, what's up 
 Got the purple and the double cup 
 And I'm so high, got em all lookin up 
 And I bet every guy in the club wanna touch 
 Little chick in the shades and the smile in the cut 
 Bet they all blind, if they not, look it up 
 Cause the girl with the crunk group of girls yellin what 
 Throwin bows, gettin drunk, better tussle in club 
 They be yellin break it out, hold that drank 
 Break it down, smoke that dank 
 Gonna make it loud, what y'all think 
 Got purple clouds, and my [?] 
 Got em messed up, these girls stay trippin 
 But not this girl, cause this girl stay pimpin 
 And I was always taught get in where you fit in 
 And I fit in really well in like every single city 
 Yo, look, um, I be knowin everyone wanna come alive 
 When I derive and I be spittin that fire 
 Everybody got that look in their eyes 
 When I get down on stage and then I get a little higher 
 Cause I buy y'all bars 
 Y'all thought y'all stars 
 My crew don't ever get tired 
 Cause they wired 
 Liquor buy yours 
 Higher just as my little picture on the flyer 
 Chicks stay shocked how we steppin about 
 Cars with no top how we gettin' around 
 Thought y'all hot, we coolin' em down 
 And my guns gon' clap while we checkin the sounds
