Bet that I blow a few stacks 
 Bet you ain't know, Woke independent 
 I tell them I know you knew that, Snow be so dope 
 I'm numbing the feeling of all of the hate that I feel that I'm getting 
 From broke male rappers and ugly ass women 
 That say I ain't shit cause of Nicki and Iggy 
 They downplay the lyrics delivered, I'm killing 
 I'm hitting, but have you seen them? 
 Only way that Imma kill it, get a booty like Selena 
 Heard she ate pizza, now I'm calling Domino's, Pizza Hut, my man cheesin' 
 Cause for some reason he like that I'm eating 
 I'm pushing this weight now my weight kinda leading 
 But staying in places, he like what he seeing 
 I tell him grab on 'cause I'm taking these beatings 
 And-I'm-out-here working again 
 Ain't that what I'm supposed to do? Bitch, I'm a Mexican 
 While you bedazzled, I'm fighting embezzlements 
 I be in court and I'm not one to settle it 
 Y'all owe me money, I will fucking get it then 
 I know the rules and my rules have been bent 
 And my grind committed, my money demented 
 I'll hire some immigrants, pin you like Pinterest 
 'Cause they don't know English, they won't get a sentence 
 'Cause we could build houses, no blueprint, no template 
 Believe me, it's easy to burn down your residence 
 Snow get them wake 'cause they're not on the census 
 Now bitch, you can bet that I will 
 Now bitch, you can bet that I will 
 Now bitch, you can bet that I will 
 This shit ain't made for twerking bitches 
 It's for crazy ass 2am on the ground lurking bitches 
 For shoot first-ask questions last, kill a bitch before you even knew if she did it for certain bitches 
 It's for double shift pulling out working bitches 
 Don't sell sex, but goddamn I ain't no virgin, bitches 
 Fuck me over and I'll take your man, I'll take his new girl and... I'll turn them bitches! 
 I got a motherfucking Vendetta, never been a little bitch I'm cold as thin sweaters and I'm finna get 'em 
 When I step up in the venue, and I'm closing out your shows cause ooh bitch, you should've been better 
 Look, I don't give a motherfuck if I never make it to platinum 
 They'll always pull up a tab and remember how I was rappin' 
 How I was killin' these beats and it's all chronologically captured 
 They'll always see how I'm changing these patterns and how these tracks get, demolished 
 'Cause I been at this, I've always been this advanced 
 Astonished at how a female rapper don't have one but they're no match 
 It's ironic 'cause if it's fashion, they're probably having asthma 
 But bitches this what I do I be chopping them and you be like "Uh"
