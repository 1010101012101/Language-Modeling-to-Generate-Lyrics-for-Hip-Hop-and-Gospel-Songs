I was born from this lifestyle, rich and famous 
 My aim for tomorrow is to get more haters 
 Paparazzis always jot me 'cause I'm on the A-List 
 So I get so much hate, I swear it's outrageous 
 'Cause I'm stating something new (That's why they hatin') 
 Cause of jewels (That's why they hatin') 
 'Cause we make moves (That's why they hatin') 
 'Cause we that crew (That's why they hatin') 
 'Cause we get loot (That's why they hatin') 
 'Cause we too cool (That's why they hatin') 
 'Cause we got swag from the head down to the shoes 
 (Verse 1: Snow Tha Product) 
 It must be something in the water 
 That got these haters mumbling and whispering 
 Or maybe it's that the money is coming in and getting spent 
 Perhaps the fact that I be buzzing and getting bent off 
 Two hundred dollar bottles while clubbing and kicking it 
 Maybe 'cause I be taking trips to international destinations 
 I be gassing and wrecking stages while I'm rapping and getting famous 
 I'm making my ends meet while I'm laughing at all these haters 
 'Cause I'm smashing these imitators so they mad 'cause I'm getting paper 
 I think they hating, so Imma show 'em 
 And you better believe that Imma show them 
 What happens when you piss snow off 
 Imma speed it up a bit 
 Show them how to get the club to crunk up a bit 
 Imma show them real stacks with Benjamins peeled back 
 And Imma be the cause for their suffering 
 'Cause if they mad now, they've got to hate me then 
 Cause by this summer Imma show them that I'm majoring 
 Let them know they're crazy if they hate again 
 Cause maybe if I'm in the mood to prove them wrong 
 Tell them that the whip was made for this 
 [Verse 2: Lil Flip 
 Grew up in the hood, let me put that work 
 I come from the streets, let me do that dirt 
 Whoop that blow, shit that smell 
 Lay back in a Maybach, blow that kurk 
 Mind on my cash, mind on my glass, nine in stash 
 And if I say I want ASS, she gon' give it to me NOW 
 Oh my god, I go hard on any track, snow, let them know 
 Twin desert eagles in arm reach and I let them blow 
 Rap is overrated, you're constipated (tell them what that means, Flip) 
 That mean they spitting BULLSHIT 
 More clips, M3's, zim pops, red beams 
 I tell them 'Hi, Haters' as I will soon dream 
 Drop top my global beats larger than a shot cloud 
 My track, baby, you can hear my music play in Bash Crop 
 I'm getting mad props, cash knots, bad drops 
 I'm pushing penny red trucks like red fox 
 Old school or gold shoes (I call them Micheal Johnsons) 
 And I can make you a death wish (Just call me Charles Wayne) 
 (Verse 3: Snow Tha Product) 
 You see the fact I'm hot, the fact you're not 
 Is because you ain't ever done half what I 
 Done in a year, or done in a week 
 Its because no one even like you on your block 
 I don't know, but keep it up 
 'Cause I get new fans when you bring me up 
 'Ey, ey, Snow White, isn't that that girl that you wish you was?' 
 See, you would hate her from your face to your nikes 
 That's why you say that you don't like me, but then you bite me 
 You're not original, and I mean you're psyche 
 Keep it up, you'll be sleeping with the fishes like a Pisces 
 Bye hater, as I'm hopping on a plane 
 And an hour later, I arrive up in the Bay 
 To a show then get my dough and hit the road to another place 
 Case closed, you'se a joke, and you know that you'se a fake 
 But this is real gucci and the luggage is real luis 
 And I run with folk that only know you as a real groupie 
 So haters are welcome, feel free to feed my buzz 
 Just don't be surprised when you pick up you phone and all your luck is up
