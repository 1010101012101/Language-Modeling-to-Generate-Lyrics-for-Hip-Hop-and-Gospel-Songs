(Intro: Daenerys) 
 Do you understand I'm no ordinary woman? 
 My dreams come true 
 I've been marginalized, I've been obliged 
 To succumb to come to the politics, swallow my pride 
 I been in the offering by all of these guys 
 Try walk, I get the brought down to size 
 Why am I constantly questioned 
 If inevitably I'm destined to take what we know as my life 
 That's the life on the throne and a life I should own 
 Only people that standing would be on my side 
 I've been up for this long and ain't slept 
 I've been here, I've been gone with no rest 
 And I'll take that, take this and take them 
 Taking no stepbacks, we'll make shit a movement 
 There ain't no rest out, I'll be taking to allignment 
 And ain't no example, no tempering, I will win 
 But I bet that betting will begin by a measly small, frail woman 
 Now they see me, but I will summon 
 But to me it's fire like hell's coming 
 In a world where a girl isn't much 
 I got the fire that none of y'all gonna touch 
 I've built an army, I've been all in the cut 
 I've moved along 
 I've worked as hard as the toughest men involved in all the darkness 
 Of blood so [?] the swords were drawn at the cusp 
 But oppurtunity risen between broken trust 
 And an obsene scene of deep greed and lust 
 And I've seen the injust' 
 Then they told me to cut the chains, leashes up 
 And that's reason enough 
 And I will take that, take this and take them 
 Where the rest at there won't be next of kin 
 If you don't step back, step down, I'm convinced 
 I don't wanna kill, but I bet I will for the win 
 What I built isn't it, gather a million men 
 It's a man's world till a girl works hard as him 
 When I begin and thoughts come in, stick it to them again 
 I can guarantee no one fighting me is gonna live
