Last summer I went to Mexico 
 Spent a little bit of that extra dough 
 Wanted to just relax and kick back and forget about shows 
 I just wanted to club and get krunk with my primas 
 And get a real good buzz and get drunk off margaritas 
 When all of a sudden while dancing along to my Jenni Rivera jam 
 I look to my left and oh my I seen a man 
 He was wearing a Tejana and botas de avestruz 
 And had a belt to match and drank patron like it was juice 
 He looktit like a boss, he really caught my eye 
 Cause never in my life did I go out with a man like this guy 
 He took me out to dinner and showed me all his vacas 
 And introduced me to his little pit bull named Chata 
 And then I met his mama, listened to Intocable 
 He told me that he and his compa talked about some jale 
 Taught me how to say me vale 
 And he said mira mami que digan lo que digan 
 Mija mientales la madre 
 I fell in live with a vaquero, 
 Botas y sombreros 
 And I'ma cross him over I'ma pay for his pollero 
 And we goin' get married and he goin' get papers 
 But I'ma hunt him down if he tell me see you later 
 I fell in live wit a vaquero 
 Botas y sombreros 
 And I'ma cross him over, I'ma pay for his pollero 
 And we goin' get married and he goin' get papers 
 But I'ma hunt him down if he tell me see you later
