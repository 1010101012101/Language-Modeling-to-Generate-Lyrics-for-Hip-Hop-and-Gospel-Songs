Every time you with me, you be staying on your phone 
 And every time I look at you 
 I see that stupid glow up off your phone 
 Go fuck your phone 
 Go, go, go, go, go fuck your phone 
 Go fuck your phone, y-y-your phone 
 E-e-e-every time you with me, you be staying on your phone 
 And every time I look at you 
 I see that stupid glow up off your phone 
 Go fuck your phone, y-y-your phone 
 Fuck your phone, go fuck your phone. 
 I swear to God that I'm just like ugh! I mean ugh! 
 Look, I'm 'bout two seconds from grabbing that getro pcs 
 And chunkin' that shit right up at your head 
 'Cause I swear that I hope you lose reception 
 Or that yo shit get disconnected 
 'Cause I'm so tired of your no job-havin' ass 
 All on this date disrespecting 
 It's like every time that you come around 
 I just see that stupid glow right up off your phone 
 And up off yo dome 
 And ya got me talking to myself like I'm alone 
 Got a girl like me 'bout ready to explode 
 I'ma need me a man that's fully grown 
 Ain't worried about retweets, livin' up in these streets 
 Beep beep, boy you better watch that road 
 What the hell is so urgent that you worried 'bout that bird 
 And that lil' timeline 
 Better be sure that's really worth the fact 
 That you 'bout to kiss my ass bye-bye 
 Wasting my time with your sideline ass 
 Phone giggling all bright-eyed old immature lookin' ass grown lil boy 
 Get the hell up out my eyesight 
 I got real problems, real life 
 Got real shit that I'ma deal with 
 And you been up on it, call it killing time 
 Well that's it, you really just killed it 
 So fuck you, fuck your phone, fuck your social network 
 I'ma go out in the real world as a real girl 
 You hang ten in your net surf 
 Every time you with me, you be staying on your phone 
 And every time I look at you 
 I see that stupid glow up off your phone 
 Go fuck your phone 
 Go, go, go, go, go fuck your phone 
 Go fuck your phone, y-y-your phone 
 E-e-e-every time you with me, you be staying on your phone 
 And every time I look at you 
 I see that stupid glow up off your phone 
 Go fuck your phone, y-y-your phone 
 Fuck your phone, go fuck your phone. 
 Umm she wanna instagram her dinner

 OMG SMH what a bummer bitch 
 Nowadays two people be next to each other 
 Don't talk, just twitter mention each other 
 Texting each other 
 Oh shit, God forbid y'all show interest in each other 
 OMG I'm having so much fun 
 Woo this party's awesome 
 Umm sure it is 
 And so much so you gon' sit up on your phone and gossip 'bout 
 Who did what, and what they did 
 And who in love and who been friends 
 And who hate who and who say when 
 And who got fired and who just quit 
 This shit is wack 
 My phone is off, I'm getting crunk 
 I'm living life, finna fucking ball 
 We getting drunk, see we got fat bitches and skinny bitches 
 And medium bitches, and thick bitches 
 And most of the world won't see it 
 Fuck it, I'ma twitpic it 
 Every time you with me, you be staying on your phone 
 And every time I look at you 
 I see that stupid glow up off your phone 
 Go fuck your phone 
 Go, go, go, go, go fuck your phone 
 Go fuck your phone, y-y-your phone 
 E-e-e-every time you with me, you be staying on your phone 
 And every time I look at you 
 I see that stupid glow up off your phone 
 Go fuck your phone, y-y-your phone 
 Fuck your phone, go fuck your phone.
