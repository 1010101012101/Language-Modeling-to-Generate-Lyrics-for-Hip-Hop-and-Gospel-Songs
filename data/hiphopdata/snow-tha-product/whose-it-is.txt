I know you got a job and a ride like that 
 Got the house and the bills, you divide that math 
 Got your part and your man's if he got off track 
 You the shit and you know it, you be all on that 
 Got a blazer and a white shirt, skirt or some black sacks 
 Cause you all about your business, never hit with that tax 
 And you're hella independent, goddamn you're not bad 
 But your man now be looking at these bitches like that 
 Gon' show 'em whose it is 
 Whose it is, whose it is, whose it is 
 Y'all know I don't rap about sex, off top 
 'Cause I can go harder and I'll rap nonstop 
 I don't need to pretend or nor do I cockblock 
 But these bitches out here sucking so hard, they lockjawed 
 I'm a chick with smart talk, go hard and nonstop 
 They say they call shots but call me cockblock 
 Your product all wrong, no cuts, no uh, uh 
 I'll chop you hoes off, I'm 'bout to show off 
 Gon' show 'em whose it is 
 Whose it is, whose it is, whose it is 
 You really know how you got it when you do it 
 Cause you keep it on the low, you ain't ratchet, you ain't stupid 
 But when you homey with the flow and you be dancing to the music 
 When they saw you in the mirror in the private where you move it 
 Fuck a cat daddy 
 You gon turn your ass around and look back at it 
 If they saw you they gon have to throw some cash at it 
 When you back it all the way it's like bad traffic, bad habits 
 And in a [?] 
 Gon' show 'em whose it is 
 Whose it is, whose it is, whose it is
