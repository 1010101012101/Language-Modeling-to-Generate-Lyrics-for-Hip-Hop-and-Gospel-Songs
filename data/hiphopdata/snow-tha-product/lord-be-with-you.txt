 Cause these hoes stay salty like condiments 
 But I be killin' game and I'll chalk a bit 
 Cause these square ass bitches already in the right shape

 I flip a ditch like I flip the bitch 
 And I'm makin' money legitimate 
 But my side hustle finna make me rich 
 My money movin' and circlin'

 And I'll post the bitch and she will work the day 
 What you tellin' me, you ain't hearin' me?

 You think I'm finna have a fella take care of me?
