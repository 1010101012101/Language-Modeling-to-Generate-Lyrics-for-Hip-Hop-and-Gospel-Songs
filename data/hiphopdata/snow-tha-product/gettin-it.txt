God damn I'm a rock band member 
 And I've always been a G 
 Thought you lost that letter on me 
 Literally I've been getting it 
 Guap that's cheddar, get Up off that 
 You've better go out and do better 
 Get a job, get a bitch, get some positive shit 
 Get a mob into it, get some profit and flip 
 Everything you ever wanted it's not impossible bitch 
 Get up off your lazy ass and just go get it 
 You know I be getting it, getting it, getting it 
 You know I be getting it, getting it, getting it 
 You know I be getting it, getting it, getting it 
 Bet you, I'm a get it, I ain't trippin' 'bout no hater bitches 
 My team and I winnin' I ain't finna sit debate it with em 
 Bet you, I'm a get it, I ain't trippin' 'bout no hater bitches 
 My team and I winnin' I ain't finna sit debate it with em 
 I'd be hitting the party with five chicks 
 And I'm probably leaving all these kids 
 Calling for my hips 
 Got a bunch of them behind me 
 And all up on my shit 
 I be getting it, I got it, I'm all about profit 
 I be all in the function I'm steady red cuppin' 
 I'm whooping their asses, I flip a cup 
 I'm young and I'm loving the life in the club 
 And I'm getting that bread and I'm a get enough 
 You know I be getting it, getting it, getting it 
 You know I be getting it, getting it, getting it 
 You know I be getting it, getting it, getting it 
 Bet you, I'm a get it, I ain't trippin' 'bout no hater bitches 
 My team and I winnin' I ain't finna sit debate it with em 
 Bet you, I'm a get it, I ain't trippin' 'bout no hater bitches 
 My team and I winnin' I ain't finna sit debate it with em 
 With em, I ain't finna sit debate it with 'em (wi-with em) 
 I ain't finna sit debate it with em 
 Dumb dumb dumb bitches 
 Dumb dumb 
 I ain't trippin', dumb dumb dumb bitches 
 You know I'd be getting it, getting it, getting it 
 You know I'd be getting it, getting it, getting it 
 You know I'd be getting it, getting it, getting it
