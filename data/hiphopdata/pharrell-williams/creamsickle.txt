Hey girl... 
 Turn the bass down some more... 
 Here we go 
 I just got your text message, 
 That you want me to join you, oh,(yeah) 
 My reluctance would be less threatening, 
 If you told me what you had on 
 See this is what happens soon as I get home 
 Damn girl it feels good being right here 
 You can tell I'm serious by my tone 
 I can't see your eyes move your hair 
 Is it possible for you to still moan 
 This is changing my life do you care 
 Can you believe that my mind's been blown 
 Or should I swear... that 
 I'm your guy 
 I'm your man to be 
 I can make anything happen all of a sudden... 
 But 
 You're my girl, 
 You're my fantasy... 
 And when you kiss me there it pushes love's button...

 It seems you licked my creamsickle down 
 (Oh, oh) (cream) 
 But I couldn't get no better no more 
 (Oh, oh) (cream)
