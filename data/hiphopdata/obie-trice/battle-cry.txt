(Intro: Adrian Rezza) 
 Yeah, yeah yeah yeah 
 Battle cry 
 I've been shot by my critics 
 Took the bout by the cynics 
 Feel like my life's on display 
 Like the museum exhibits 
 Puts my life on the line 
 Invested years in these rhymes 
 [?] Street's thirst and they need it 
 Now hear my battle cry 
 (Verse 1: Obie Trice) 
 O-Trice, back, at it 
 They don't wanna see him platinum 
 They just wanna see him pratted 
 They just wanna see him tec something 
 (?) 
 Get next to him 
 So they can be the first to rat it 
 Savage, put him in a cascet 
 Categorize him, say Cheers was a classic 
 That's it, as if 
 He ain't bring the city to the masses 
 Minus Mathers, but my name is astrous 
 Like the [?] ain't shown them where the cash at 
 (?) 
 O has fucked[?], as you should 
 Never mind a player hater, as long as you could 
 Never change, gutter 
 So you can downplay my name, O still the same 
 Come on 
 (Hook: Adrian Rezza) 
 Keep going, keep going on 
 Keep going, keep going on 
 This my battle cry, battle cry 
 (x2) 
 Waiting with patience 
 In the dark like a vagrant 
 Determining this circus 
 [?] Want entertainment 
 My wings have been clipped, but now I'm ready to fly 
 In the heavens with angels 
 While devils wished I died 
 (Verse 2: Obie Trice) 
 O-Trice, back, at it 
 I ain't never came whack 
 All I ever gave's crack 
 All I ever gave's back 
 Ain't a human being on this earth saying opposite that 
 You can misconstrue what he do 
 'Cause he cruise in an automobile 
 (?) 
 I know how to double-up 
 Then double platinum 
 No matter the circus stands, see I emerge from that 
 Used to serve the bundles, now the verse intact 
 Used to worship onions, now I service rap 
 The certain cat's uncertain with that 
 They'd rather see him service, dirtnap 
 Like I deserve them curses 
 Like I don't speak in cursive 
 Like I ain't got a purpose 
 Beast of the streets 
 Dope stay on O-Trice's person 
 (Hook: Adrian Rezza) 
 Keep going, keep going on 
 Keep going, keep going on 
 This my battle cry, battle cry 
 (x3) 
 (Outro: Obie Trice) 
 BME, Obie Trice, 2011, Bottoms Up 
 You know 
 Some days you the dog, some days you the hydrant 
 Gotta keep moving
