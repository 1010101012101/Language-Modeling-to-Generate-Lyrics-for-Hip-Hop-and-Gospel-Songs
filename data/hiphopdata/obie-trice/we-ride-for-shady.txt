Obie Trice: 
 We run this shit, fo-five on the hip 
 Been ridin' for Shady... 
 Cashis: 
 Cashis 'n' O, Shady Records 
 The dream team... 
 (Verse 1: Cashis) 
 Sittin' in the back of the, all gray Accura 
 Gun to the passenger, for acting tough 
 Scatter wheel in the passin, Harder than assassin 
 Plus I'm on the draw-down, quick as fuck, 
 Last move 'fore I give all street shit up 
 Put a nigga in the ground, face down, feet up 
 This nigga here tried to cuff me for my Re-Up 
 When I went to his crib he called police up 
 Now you on your way to being pimp paplega 
 For sending messages through bitches like, 'You gon' see us' 
 Shady! Cash, king of the dope-fiends, plus 
 Can move a square mile by blocks till I'm creamed up 
 Take the bullet out of Obie head, put it in my pistol and use it 
 As ammunition on the niggas that hit, fam 
 I got to war on the regular, man 
 'Cause I'm part of the dream team, you a regular man 
 Force rap, I don't see no competitors, and 
 You see things like me, when my metal run hand 
 I'm a state case boy with a federal plan 
 And huntin' them beats, beatin' the shit out skinheads 
 I'm the spirit of a G, bringin' lyrics to the street 
 I'm Cashis, a real dope boy on the beat 
 Slumped in the seat, tucked, clutchin' the heat 
 Basically, you niggas can't fuck with me 
 (Chorus: Cashis) 
 We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip, 
 'Bout to ride for Shady 
 Y'all niggas ain't hard, y'all niggas ain't real 
 Y'all niggas ain't crazy 
 Bring it on if you want, you don't know the homicides 
 That I've done lately 
 We run this shit, fo'-five on the hip 
 'Bout to ride for Shady 
 (Verse 2: Obie Trice) 
 Yeah, Trice is back on the Alchy track 
 With Cashis, capitalising on this mic, in fact 
 We fuckin' with the captain of rap, my nigga with the Nike cap 
 Keep the cottonoid in quite exact 
 So I'm luring you cats into the second class act 
 Where maturing's the number uno asset, as yet 
 Who's the pastor, driver, O. Trice 
 The flow to die for and death blow survive 
 I echo through your external vibe 
 With internal experiences I've acquired 
 I'm probably the most honest Hip-Hopper alive 
 A victim, depicting images from my own eyes 
 Never livin' through holmes, why 
 Homie got his own set of stand-up cahoonas, stand-up guy 
 It's Cashis, O. Tri', rappers we blow by 
 This is as accurate as the masses will have it, no lie 
 (Nigga!)
