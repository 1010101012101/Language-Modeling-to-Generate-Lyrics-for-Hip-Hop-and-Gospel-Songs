Woo, damn 
 There's a lot of bitches up in here tonight, boy 
 I'm about to get drunk 
 Let's hold down, sleep 
 Where the bar at? 
 Okay, okie dokey Obie's here 
 No more focus, hobo's got a career 
 And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here 
 And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear 
 She erotic and it's hot, saw Heineken beer 
 Put it to the side and invite here to 'Cheers' 
 Pull up a chair, swear no drama 
 Therefore player, you're workin' with a monster 
 I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place 
 Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state 
 Concentrate, you will find that you're bound to get 
 But we found what's fate 
 We can watch two incredible mates masturbate 
 Why settle and wait, let's escalate to the nearest who bang 
 To your rear is on the mirrors 
 And they smearin' booty cheeks, c'mon 
 So this is my favorite song 
 Now sing along when the DJ throws it on 
 And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep 
 And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 
 So this is my favorite song 
 Now sing along when the DJ throws it on 
 And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep 
 And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 
 Okay, holy moly derriere 
 Look around the club booty everywhere 
 She caught me starin' 
 And my homies darin' me to approach Karen 
 She's model material but she got a venereal 
 Tons of baby fathers', baby, bottles and cereal 
 She holla, 'cause I got a lot of genedio 
 The DJ's playin' Obie song on the steady-o 
 And she's impaired and she wants to be headin' home 
 With the real thing not the dildo clone 
 And I know I don't wanna be headin' home 
 With some double D's full of silicon 
 Ten hoodrat chicks surround me outside 
 Found me outside, clown me outside 
 Till I flip out and they found me outside 
 Cussin' at the bitches, screamin' "Off to they rides" 
 So this is my favorite song 
 Now sing along when the DJ throws it on 
 And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep 
 And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 
 Okay rolie polies everywhere 
 Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere 
 Obesity's glarin' and she got me fearin' 
 She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literally 
 Like a box of Cherrios 
 Carry cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls 
 I'm outta order, 'cause I gotta big girl disorder 
 So better cover up that blubber or I'll split 
 And I ain't got time to play 
 Let's investigate another place today 
 Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape 
 Dresses petite, no window drapes 
 Word to mother, they god damn Opera and beans 
 Got ya Opera and jeans 
 Seems to me a little lean cuisine 
 Wouldn't hurt much, hot don't touch 
 So this is my favorite song 
 Now sing along when the DJ throws it on 
 And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep 
 And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth 
 Haha, haha, ha 
 You gotta have teach, baby 
 It just wouldn't look right 
 Look, me big lips 
 You no teeth, it wouldn't work 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 Haha ha, yeah, I'm feelin' good 
 Shady Record man, Obie Trice, c'mon
