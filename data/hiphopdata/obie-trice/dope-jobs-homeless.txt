Shitted in it... ran from it nigga... fuck, I done did it all 
 I sold dope, watched fiends crave for rock 
 Watch 'em watchin me put the stash in my sock (yo yo) 
 Walkie talk to niggas from the corner when the feds bout to enter 
 Pumped up blocks, some of the winter 
 Kerosene heaters by my feet 
 Takin' tops off just so a nigga can eat lunch meat 
 4 days no z's from the first to third 
 End of the month too excited to get sleep 
 I bagged up tools, aggravated while picky mother fuckers 
 Who don't know which rock to choose (pick man) 
 Took out of town trips 2 seconds and the son of a bitch 
 Narcs run in talkin' shit

 Pumpin over there off of desoto 
 Any nigga who don't know about this

 Hepatitis b inflicted in a thug (yo, I'm sick man)

 You damn near fired a restaurant manager who can't manage shit 
 Stressed out and tired

 You work all week with boo 
 And one day your man boo just collapsed 
 His breakdown is caused by his bitch 
 Who dropped the drawers for a nigga who could really floss 
 5.25 and make your mouth leakin on top of that shit 
 You get a check every other week 
 You work a week in the hole 
 It's 30 muthafuckers on payroll 
 You work when they WANT you to 
 Equal opportunity? nigga, right... 
 Suburban community check stubs always hella tight 
 My shit lookin' like this?

 Pissed off at check time 'cause I was skipped 
 That's when Obie Trice start cockin back the shit... fuck this

 No place to sleep (yo) 
 Mom's don't wanna hear it 
 No place to eat (come on ma) 
 Pass out on my man's couch just for a week (yeah) 
 Till he get fed up and kick a nigga to the street (get the fuck out of here dawg) 
 Black out from cold 
 Freezin my toes (damn) 
 Snow fuckin' over my boots 
 My tems froze (shit) 
 Face turnin' blue 
 Cars riding by with the little children on the inside pointin at you (mommy look at that man) 
 Been fucked over folks 
 And they don't want to see ya 
 Baby momma got a new nigga with a visa 
 Sleepin' in cars... abandoned shit

 Plottin on a lick like 
 Stickin your man's 
 Cause damn you know he got at least a grand in his pants 
 Face lookin' old 
 Despite the fact you only 20 years old 
 Stuck in the cold 
 Snot drippin profusely (sniff sniff)

 Nap entertainment
