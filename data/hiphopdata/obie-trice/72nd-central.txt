Mr. Lennon, Mr. Lennon! 
 John John, could, could I get your autograph? 
 Could I get your autograph? (Sure kid) 
 Oh, yeah yeah yeah, just 
 Could you sign this for me please? (Sure, what's your name?) 
 Thanks thanks, I'm a real big fan, thanks thanks 
 (Here you are) Thanks a lot! 
 Word uh 
 Could do that, hot as hell though 
 Yo yo, what, uh what 
 Bella {?} hop to this, what, uh, uh 
 Set it down dawg, what 
 (One by one) Rule one up in this bitch for real 
 Roll with a couple niggaz like Dave SeVille 
 'Cause they'll, uh clean you out like some golden seals 
 Put your hands up, give me yo' scrill nigga, uh 
 (Two by two) Your bucket is clean, you ridin' mean 
 Pull up at the light on them Spree's (gimme that!) 
 School Craft wanna jingle your keys 
 Whatchu 'bout to do? Bleed! 
 (3, 1, 3) Y'all don't run the streets, the streets run you 
 Put a gun to your kids, "Art of War" Sun-Tzu 
 In the jungle stay humble or stumble and fumble 
 Till death inside a rumble 
 (Four by four) Rule four better get this down 
 Before niggaz gon' beef better have that four-pound (uh) 
 And bust like four rounds, kick the door down 
 Get yo' ass up outta town nigga, uh, uh 
 (Five by five) Niggaz connive, I thought you knew it 
 Your main man's settin' you up nigga you blew it 
 Told him what you doin', nigga, you're ruined 
 You ain't knowin'? 
 (6, 6, 6) The Devil's your man, the ghetto's your land 
 When you got knocked yo' block turned yellow and ran 
 When you got sugar, why settle for sand? 
 Never snitch when you clip and put your melons in cans 
 (Seven by seven) Rule seven kinda where my heart at 
 You want beef in the street? Don't start that 
 'Cause we'll have some niggaz up in yo' apartment 
 Jumpin' outta places where it's real dark at, uh 
 (Eight by eight) You're carryin' weight, hey, but wait 
 A lot of hungry niggaz know where you stay 
 Address your address, change your place 
 Before you spray nigga 
 (Nine by nine) I learned a lot from stank if you got bank 
 Fuck buyin' gats bitch, get a tank 
 Fuck a firearm, get a wired bomb 
 'Cause when you blow yourself up at least you dyin' warm 
 Ten jewels 
 Ten reasons, nine Glocks, eight shots 
 Seven cops, six drop on five blocks (for sho!) 
 Three cousins, two/too hot, one law, family 
 We put no man befo', ten jewels now tell 'em 
 It's one purpose, one goal, two halves 
 Get a whole, three niggaz, one song (for sho!) 
 Five ways, six days, seven plus 
 Eight/A.K., we can let the nine spray y'all 
 (Nine by nine) Oh I'm not real 'cause I pop pills? 
 Bring your block to my block nigga get your whole block killed 
 Don't let the "Purple Pills" shit confuse you 
 One outta my hand, the life'll lose you nigga 
 (Eight by eight) You lay at your wake 
 You was played, slugs struck the Escalade 
 Your brain rest on what Motor City paved 
 No more sunny days 
 (Seven by seven) Rule seven, some'in you better tell 'em 
 Good coke, good weed, y'all better sell 'em 
 'Cause they'll put some'in up into your cerebellum 
 Proof, you better tell 'em 
 (Six by six) Assume it's only for conversation 
 Let's conversate, simple nigga the .38 indiff' 
 Mine'll set trip, empty out the clip 
 Hold up, a .38 ain't got clips 
 (Five by five) Niggaz be live before they die 
 Till the test the wrong animal then they spirit fly 
 Just know the game while you playin' the tough guy 
 That's yo' life 
 (Four by four) For all you niggaz think this rap shit's a joke 
 You get smacked and choked, bring the dagger and cloak 
 I put my fuckin' heart into this shit that I wrote 
 You muh'fuckers on some dope? 
 (Three by three) Watch who near you, focus on your rear view 
 Outta life, yo the trife wanna clear you 
 Don't get caught on E and fought on streets 
 Be a victim of "Grand Theft Auto 3" 
 (Two by two) Trust no one when you're gettin' them 
 Put your life in perspective, you're killin' 'em 
 Envious niggaz stay jealousy driven 
 Niggaz need to be listenin' 
 (One by one) It's one reason why I still let you breathe 
 It's one reason why the fuckin' tec won't squeeze 
 It's one reason why you ain't go out like NSync 
 That's 'cause it's one other nigga that'll do it for me, yo 
 Ten jewels
