(Talking) 
 Yeah 
 We ain't here to mourn 
 We here to celebrate 
 So this one is for all my dogs that didn't make it in this struggle man 
 I's remember when I was on the ave clutching 'em dimes, 
 Gut touchin my spine, 
 Bustin' my rhymes, 
 Feelin' like I'm livin' in them lost times, 
 No sight of the future, 
 Damn right I'll shoot ya, 
 Palm tight on a rooster, 
 Old in the face cause this hoe on my case, 
 Got my growth at a fast pace, 
 Old folks like "Oh, oh he's a bad case, 
 He won't last, his track record'll do the math" 
 Crack solicitation on the avenue, 
 It's not new to you listeners but this is true, 
 Listen up, 
 I gotta spew it and keep it all truth or else, 
 I might as well give this up, 
 Feel me now, 
 From rocks to pow pows, 
 Glocks to pow-da, 
 I done did it all so I clutch my balls, 
 And notice they still here so Obie is still here, 
 So Kobie, here's to you and daddy's new career 
 So Grab ya cups of (Beer) 
 And Put 'em up let's (Cheer) 
 Here's a toast to all my soldiers who ain't here 
 This is it my niggas 
 This what we boast about 
 Get ya bottles homie pour some out 
 Now grab ya cups of (Gin) 
 Put 'em up let's (Win) 
 Here's a toast to never lookin' back again 
 This is it my niggas 
 This what we boast about 
 Get ya bottles homie pour some out 
 Now I understand every man got a story to tell, 
 But fuck it I got a story as well, 
 Growin' up where us niggas either buried or jail, 
 Popped by Dirty Harry or popped by the cops for the yayo, 
 Locked in a cell, 
 Who's to blame when I was raised in this hood where my crew was slain, 
 Only a few remains, 
 Y'all talk about struggle, 
 With yo bubble gum lifestyles, 
 Nigga fuck you, 
 I'm here today for Fam passed away, 
 Bodies deep 6, nigga, 
 Flesh decayed, 
 Real cats who had TECs to spray, 
 Babies to raise, 
 Missed them cradles went straight to the grave, 
 That hood life is in me, 
 So I sip the Remy while my pockets scream gimme, 
 Lend me ya ear, 
 I guarantee y'all feelin' me, 
 Straight from the block to the industry 
 C'mon! 
 So Grab ya cups of (Beer) 
 And Put 'em up let's (Cheer) 
 Here's a toast ta all my soldiers who ain't here 
 This is it my niggas 
 This what we boast about 
 Get ya bottles homie pour some out 
 Now grab ya cups of (Gin) 
 Put 'em up let's (Win) 
 Here's a toast to never lookin' back again 
 This is it my niggas 
 This what we boast about 
 Get ya bottles homie post 'em out
