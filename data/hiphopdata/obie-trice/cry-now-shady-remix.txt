 Kuniva 
 Cashis 
 Stat quo 
 Bobby Creekwater 
 Obie Trice 
 What 
 Niggas didn't kill me 
 Now a niggas gon' get 
 Peel my cap back 
 I'm never at home 
 I'm somewhere 
 With my shaft restin' on a ho's tongue 
 Sippin on some Don perion 
 While she's sippin up them newborns 
 Yeah bet you hate the news holmes 
 You probably somewhere 
 Sittin' on the stoop huh 
 Sippin' on the brew 
 Plottin' to pop me later huh 
 When will a hater learn 
 I'm too great on a song 
 I push weight on the corner 
 Send weight to the coroner 
 When courage make 'em turn performer 
 I transform into Uma Thurman 
 A dude's virgin 
 Verses lettin' superfulious 
 With no purpose nigga 
 Continue to walk this earth's surface 
 I was birthed for hip-hop 
 Branch out my services 
 Ya try to murder this nigga 
 That's comin' from the same turf as yas 
 What nerves have yas 
 Pissed because your hussles ain't worth a shit 
 I'm gettin' rich 
 I'm on my way to Hugh Hefner's 
 Dig? 
 With a bitch 
 You in the trenches tryin' to reach it big 
 On another rapper's dick 
 Go on represent where you live 
 Know you annoyed 
 But don't make the mistake 
 I'm state to state in that Honda nigga 
 Not an accord 
 I'm in that Honda G4 you will never afford 
 And yup it's probably ease when a nigga is on board 
 I know 
 Cry now 
 I know 
 Cry now 
 I know 
 Cry now 
 Nigga cry now 
 I'll be damned if I let a nigga lay his hands on me 
 I'll lay his ass out 
 And park a grand dam on him 
 The city where the weak survive 
 And the strong die 
 Where beef collides 
 Shootouts happen and hit the wrong guy 
 I done seen the worst of the worst 
 And what can be worse 
 Than a verse about bullets 
 Dispersed up in your shirt 
 The streets is like a curse 
 Niggas frontin' for a bitch 
 It's like you beggin' to die 
 Like bear huntin' with a switch 
 A part of my heart is gone 
 I could never smile the same 
 Trigger finger is itchy 
 It'll take awhile to tame 
 Detroit is hella dirty 
 But the dozen can fix it 
 Resist and the biscut will exceed the distance 
 And bounce off one's home 
 Hit and riquoche off a kid's trombone 
 Right to where you niggas lay 
 Obie can tell you that death is just a few inches away 
 Y'all shed tears 
 But y'all can get your feel of it today 
 I know 
 Cry now 
 I know 
 Cry now 
 I know 
 Cry now 
 Nigga cry now 
 Obie they gotta fuck with us this time nigga 
 Bobby Creek 
 Nigga 
 Laugh now 
 Cry never 
 My bereta is a body part 
 Hit him with just enough shots 
 To make his body hard 
 Now I feel like we even 
 See Creek is here to shine a light on you niggas 
 Diseasin' 
 Soon as I get my karma right on Lindsy Rose 
 I'm leavin' 
 Load up a clip 
 And make it dark on them heroes cheesin' 
 Shit they got snitches on the clock 
 Gotta watch what I'm sayin' 
 Me buy a bitch a couple rocks 
 And the watch quit playin' 
 Back on my greasy 
 My neezy 
 Nobody bread whippin 
 And for them fuckin' spectators 
 I brought the band with me 
 Halftime niggas 
 And grab pine 
 You will never grab mine nigga 
 The dolli's was lyin' 
 When he said you was gon' be fine nigga 
 Cashis! 
 Witness art of war 
 In the phyical 
 Since raw coke was rushed through my umbilical 
 And no words from cash mouth is fixin' 
 Ready with dope clips 
 I'm ever dissin' 
 My aura of war is raw to the core 
 The surface of the street 
 When I walk through the door 
 My purpose is to move up 
 Pull tools 
 You perpin' 
 Watch me overthrow the government 
 In my turban 
 Plot up and line up 
 Solo mia 
 Prayin' to proof 
 I'm searchin for Jerry Garcia 
 Talk to my brother 
 Gone in the streets of the D 
 I'm talkin' to K 
 And hopin' niggas waitin on me 
 Take the first shot then 
 The second rounds on me 
 And when the wars on the other side 
 Me and my brother ride 
 I don't rap for the plaques 
 My contracts signed just for scraps 
 To get you wack nigga 
 With a gun with a ? with a bat 
 Take a slug through the lung 
 Get you right what you rappin' nigga 
 I'm born crazy raised in more fame 
 It's the clappin' down bang 
 It's for entertainment 
 I know 
 Cry now 
 I know 
 Cry now 
 I know 
 Cry now 
 Nigga cry now 
 Young stack he the gat 
 On tuck 
 Want war 
 I don't give a fuck 
 Shot till you kiss 
 And pucker up 
 It'll lift 'em up 
 Believe me you'll flow 
 Duracell is your family heart broke 
 Lookin' like an artichoke 
 Vegetable 
 Ho's stiff 
 Nigga paralyzed from the neck down 
 My goon stick niggas 
 Turn soldiers to stick figures 
 Hand on triggers 
 Real life born killers 
 We roll out like four wheelers 
 God sent us 
 From backstabbers and gold diggers 
 Tipsy off brown liquor 
 Watch me 
 Obnoxious 
 Broad call me cocky 
 Poppin' long dick 
 Stabbed it out the box like hockey 
 Especially when a bitch ride it like jockey 
 From the benz to the range to the black joloppy 
 I'm the shit 
 The only one who ain't heard is Foxy 
 Formalize a plan 
 No man can stop me 
 Ball all 
 Stat quo 
 Understand 
 Ya copy? 
 I know 
 Cry now 
 I know 
 Cry now 
 I know 
 Cry now 
 Nigga cry now 
 Eminem: 
 It's the re-up!
