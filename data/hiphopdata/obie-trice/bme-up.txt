Nigga we up, we don't give a fuck 
 We gon' keep holdin' this shit down 
 Nigga raise up, you can get bucked 
 Gangstas around 
 Got the world in a flux, all on the nuts 
 You can't stop us now 
 This where the riders at 
 Till we posted up somewhere beneath the ground 
 BME, trust the truth's in the booth 
 He don't take a hit to let 'em know I'm bullet-proof 
 Rest in peace Proof, this is no truce 
 This is, hood music brought directly to you 
 Mac-11 in the Chevy with a nigga or two 
 Ready for whatever, we cuckoo, loose screw 
 Used to bungalows juicin up fiends 
 Just to ride 'round in the new school 
 Come from, basehead rentals, same faces, no dental 
 Claimin they gon' pay incidentals 
 Give a fiend a break, he see God all in ya 
 Then he run game till your change all minimal 
 Pinnin them predicaments to live that life 
 I been spendin Benjamins since the early '90s 
 Now BME is where a nigga can find me 
 Still on the grind nigga still gettin' mine 
 Nigga we up, we don't give a fuck 
 We gon' keep holdin' this shit down 
 Nigga raise up, you can get bucked

 Niggaz, I done been around the world and back 
 Ask about Trice, ain't shit fuckin' with that 
 BME said "Get 'em," Obie did exact 
 Straight from the trap to the muh'fuckin' map 
 Young nigga, star, do this, car 
 Louis, where a nigga murder a track 
 Hurdle over snares and claps 
 So verbal, had to dumb it down so your ears adapt 
 Now it's (Money in the Bank), Lil' Scrap's pappy 
 'Preme in the tank, ain't a vehic' could pass me 
 Ask BME how a nigga from Craft be 
 Nasty, K covered up in the back seat 
 Any melee comin' at me - death day 
 Pastor be speakin' to your fam-lay 
 G shit, I'ma rap till my sun set 
 'Cept sun's up; BME what? 
 Nigga we up, we don't give a fuck

 Nigga I don't slip, handle 'em, rap's Rip Hamilton 
 All in his mansion, gamblin 
 Alls I'm tryin' to do is match 'em, rappin' 
 Get a couple chicks, I'm ramblin, stab 'em 
 Take 'em to the crib where it's magnum, madness 
 Mashin, ass, as if, you ain't know the half 
 It's BME, that's the muh'fuckin' staff 
 Now I represent on they behalf - yes 
 Nigga we up, we don't give a fuck 
 We gon' keep holdin' this shit down 
 Nigga raise up, you can get bucked 
 Gangstas around 
 Got the world in a flux, all on the nuts
