Y'all don't see me in the hood 
 It's 'cause I'm doing this man 
 Nigga's I'm still grindin (yeah) 
 I'm still hearin those sirens 
 I'm still gettin' chased by those lights 
 Only the light's mine and my mic's on 
 And my time is none because I'm writin more 
 And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business 
 I'm here to eat, speak until these hoes feel this {fo sho} 
 And I can't let y'all derail me man 
 I got young coby, homie, you gotta let go of Obie 
 Cause Obie be back (ain't goin' no where man) we got them cracks Goin' on 
 And that yak going on 
 Soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin 
 It's whateva put that on the chedda man 
 But in the meantime 
 It's Jimmy ivene time (fo sho) 
 Chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out,(fo sho) 
 This is it my nigga this what we boast about 
 Now I'm here so shut your motherfuckin mouth 
 And show me love bitch 
 I just wanna love 
 For the rest of my life, {I don't love you bitch} 
 I wanna hold you in the mornin {Ha} 
 Hold you through the night, {Hahaha} 
 I just wanna love you 
 For the rest of my life {We wanna love alcohol, we wanna love guns} 
 I wanna hold you in the mornin, {we wanna love money} 
 Hold you through the night, {Ha, we don't wanna love bitches though} 
 There's a certain mistique when I speak 
 That you notice that it's sorta unique 
 Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep 
 And I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat 
 You can't sit still 
 It's like tryin' to smoke crack and go to sleep 
 I'm strap, just knowin' any minute I could snap 
 I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped 
 I bully these rappers so bad lyrically 
 It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry 
 It ain't even money, you can't pay me enough 
 For you to play me 
 It's cock amamie, you just ain't zanie enough to rock with Shady 
 My noodle is cock adoodle, my clocks koo koo 
 I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kitten kaboodel 
 I'm just brutal, its no rumor, I'm numoro uno 
 Assume it 
 There's no humor in it, no more you know 
 I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin ball in my bag 
 You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass 
 Em Saying 
 You better love me, bitch 
 I just wanna love, for the rest of my life 
 I wanna hold you in the morning 
 Hold you through the night 
 (And all the bitches say) 
 I just wanna love, for the rest of my life 
 I wanna hold you in the morning 
 Hold you through the night 
 My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name 
 If it ain't about the flow 
 It's about the stones and the chain 
 If I was you, I'd love me too 
 I roll like a boss, 9-11 pause same colour as cranberry sauce 
 I ain't gonna front, I thought R Kelly was da bomb 
 Then we find out he fuckin' round with bow wow bitch 
 Nigga's eatin popcorn, right, rewinding the tape 
 Now shorty momma in the precinct hollar'in "RAPE!" 
 I'm convinced man something really wrong with these hoe's 
 I thought little Kim was hot till she started fuckin' wit her nose {God Damn} 
 Use to listen to Lauren Hill and tap my feet, (Obie Trice) 
 Then the bitch put out a CD that did'nt have no beat, (uh ha) 
 That boy De angelo he determined not to fail 
 That nigga whipped butt ass for his record to sell 
 My back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes 
 And Big Ben taught Charlie b moore to deep throat
