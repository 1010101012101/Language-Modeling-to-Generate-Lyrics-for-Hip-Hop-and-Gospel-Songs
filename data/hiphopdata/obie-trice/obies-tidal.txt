Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks 
 Rap? I been in it ever... 
 So this is my favorite song 
 Now sing along when the DJ throws it on 
 And if... 
 Meantime she settin the nigga up 
 Telling us what his stuff she's ready to get him stuck, what? 
 Thick thighs... 
 ...Gon' lace you 
 Just don't whatever you do, snitch 
 'Cause you will get hit, and pray I don't face you, yeah 
 ...Let these niggas spill your drink (drink, drink) 
 Everybody lookin' at me like the boy lookin' scraggly
