(Featuring Eminem) 
 From the compilation "Anger Management 3" 
 Obie trice: 
 Obie the person that came up intreverted 
 Cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict 
 It was worth it 'cause he changed became so observant 
 Serving such of a purpose 
 If you knew him earlier in his days it's like a different version 
 So much hurtin' and pain gave him game for certain 
 That's why there's curtains in this murder if you gettin' worked up 
 I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers actin' tougher 
 I had enough of isolating myself in a room 
 Writing poems and songs, doin' the same in school 
 Now look what he became, a fool? 
 'Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you 
 Living hard but still Juliard a god walks in but ain't spend a day in the pew 
 Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents 
 So welcome to the art department 
 Eminem: 
 I stimulate the brain, mimic, emulate a saint 
 Cinic keep em' thinkin' it's a fuckin' gimic when it ain't 
 Clinically insane, brain is on Venus fuck Uranus 
 Label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say 
 He may seem as though he's plain normal 
 If you ever meet him, greet him with a shake, see 
 He ain't as mean as what they say 
 See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say 
 So he's vaugue, so they mistake him for bein' crazed 
 You part ways, your impression of him changed 
 You don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him "peace and thanks" 
 Then you catch him flippin you off, with his pants down 
 Hands around his scrotum, tuckin his fuckin' penis between his legs
