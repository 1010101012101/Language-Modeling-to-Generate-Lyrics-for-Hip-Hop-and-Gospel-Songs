You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy 
 You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy 
 Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me 
 I ain't going nowhere right now 
 It's the fo' pound bandit 
 The coke hand to hand, and he Detroit bredded 
 Goddanmit O Trice's back 
 And Oh, they so adamant I'm still at it 
 You should see the grill on a faggot if only looks could kill 
 But O is so accurate over this matter stagnant 
 It's never inadequate I swear these haters need to chill 
 It's SO automatic that he is above average 
 Jesus of Nazareth's reached his soul and so 
 He is a talent that has managed to mechanically use a pen and a pad and the alphabet to get ahead 
 Niggas mad 'cause he single handledly getting this bread 
 Bitches is in his bed, bullet still in his head 
 I'm back, fully loaded I'm ready to let off lead 
 Metal is heavy and I'm ready to let it all rip 
 The return of the vigilante on that big party and bullshit 
 You dig? The kid's back you biatch 
 You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy 
 You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy 
 Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me 
 I ain't going nowhere right now 
 I don't suffer the whispers of these envious niggas 
 Mad 'cause his nuts not in my Denim 
 Wanna be him so much the send slugs to kill him 
 And keep it on the hush not to become a victim 
 Vicious, niggas I rid them 
 I spit, piss on the statistics on that bullshit 
 I pull up muzzle yell, send the bezel berg back to here 
 I'mma thug, I'mma clap him till he fail and he fall 
 I'mma ball, I'm a beast, I'm the streets 
 I'm the reason you a broad, I'mma boss, I'm me 
 Obie bout that change, get rich fast 
 The Claude Van Damme of the game: Kick ass 
 Trapped until a nigg get out of 'Caine 
 And bounce back like whiplashes 
 And dump my cigar ashes on you asses 
 It's still Trice and Mathers all that matters 
 Call that other madness, past us 
 This is passion 
 You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy 
 You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy 
 Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me 
 I ain't going nowhere right now 
 My feet up, I read up 
 Read up on a MC who fordid, a overachiever 
 My Visa tease them in that villa overseas in that B1W with mamacita 
 G'd up, Jesus my cheese keep reaching up 
 Planted the seed and then it beamed up 
 The bean stalk being tall 
 Now I'm balling on these motherfucking peanuts 
 Huh, the demons wanna deliver me 
 Wanna deem him less than enemy but O too slippery 
 But back on you faggots nigga ain't no sympathy 
 I don't fuck with you actors I do mine differently 
 Trice made history, now all these fake niggas wanna mention me 
 Couldn't wait till I break in this with my entity 
 It don't even interest me, I'mma keep my energy spitting 
 Obie is in this to win this and that's the ending 
 You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy 
 You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy 
 Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me 
 I ain't going nowhere right now
