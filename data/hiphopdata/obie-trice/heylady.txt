Hey, can we re, can we re-enact Biggie's song? 
 C-can you shit on me? 
 I just want you to shit on me 
 Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby, I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend 
 If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions 
 I'll kill you, bitch, I'm fuckin' for real, I'll make you suffer like I suffered 
 If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love 
 Baby I'm extra large in magnitude 
 And Magnums to lubrication that I use 
 To chose which hole on a hoe I abuse 
 Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who 
 When I fuck the shit out you, then the next date 
 I rush the shit out you off my two-way 
 You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's 
 Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own 
 No, I'm in and out your home and this in and out your tone 
 I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down, put 'em in nice homes 
 And floss 'em around, I bounce 'em around 
 Camcord the sex and sell 'em around town, how that sound? 
 If I was in love witcha, now you wanna clown 
 Fuck with them clowns until I pound on your crown 
 Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me 
 Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury 
 You don't want it with me, you just horny as me 
 You want a nut, nuttin' but what is you be 
 I'm internationally known baby but actually 
 There are few people who know how I am naturally 
 All you know is that I can act irrationally 
 When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV 
 So they label me this crazed loony rap bully 
 But truthfully that ain't the truth and if you believe in that shit 
 Then you'll believe anything's true 
 And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally 
 But personally that actually works for me 
 'Cause the last thing that I need is a string attached to me 
 I'ma bachelor bitch and I ain't in no fast fury 
 To run out and find a new Mrs. Mather's 
 'Cause see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully 
 But we do still make booty calls occasionally 
 But be damned if I end up back in that pattern 
 And we end up back at that goddamn tavern 
 And havin' another deja vu, we seein' security 
 Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry 
 I got news for you bitch, your news curfew's early 
 You ain't home by 2:30 you heard me? 
 Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby, I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend 
 If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions 
 I'll kill you, bitch, I'm fuckin' for real I'll make you 
 Suffer like I suffered, if you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love 
 See you lookin' at the life, you lookin' at the lights 
 You lookin' at the ice you ain't lookin' at the Trice 
 You should look at some advice when I say he ain't nice 
 Despite the fact you think you the feisty type 
 O love to fight I love the drama 
 Love when my bitch get to cussin' out Yolanda 
 Find the Obie condom on the counter 
 Swingin' her weave, can't breathe like I can't believe 
 Least I ain't deceive and try to mislead 
 And sell a dream just to get you on my team 
 I came clean to keep down the beef 
 Keep down my reach, you can keep all your teeth 
 What we do under the covers should stay between the covers 
 And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage 
 On the front page cover of 'Us' as new lovers 
 And this is when the bitch get to showin' the true colors 
 'Cause the truth of it, everything that I do's public 
 And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends 
 Guess who you just screwed as soon as me and you've done it 
 And save the used rubber to show 'em the proof of it 
 But I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you 
 But you better be careful of who you're doin' it to 
 'Cause you never know when the shoe 
 Could end up on the other foot and it backfires on you 
 'Cause you think you want it then you want me, then you get me 
 Then you got me and you're fucked 'cause you'll be stuck with me 
 For the rest of your life 'cause if I get attached to you 
 We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you 
 You'll be walkin' out the house and I'll run up and tackle you 
 Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you 
 You don't think you're leavin' this house in that, do you? 
 Not till I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you 
 And have you walkin' out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters 
 Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather 
 Front on me? Never 'cause we gonna be together forever 
 Right bitch? Right bitch? 
 Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby, I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend 
 If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions 
 I'll kill you, bitch, I'm fuckin' for real I'll make you 
 Suffer like I suffered, if you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love 
 Fall in love, fall in love
