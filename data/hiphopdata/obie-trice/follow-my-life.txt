Yeah 
 Let y'all niggers know me 
 Yeah 
 Woo 
 Eleven, fourteen, seventy-seven 
 A nigger enter 
 Big lips, popped out placenta 
 Mamma ain't breast feed, had no pop need 
 Pop leaves shit but a name, Obie 
 Elementary homie, that's how it started 
 In garbage, retarded, gainin' that heart 
 Fuck niggers, claimin' they hard 
 A nigger come home touched 
 My motherfuckin' momma bangin' me harder 
 "Nigger, take your ass out there 
 And fight for tomorrow" 
 That's what she told me, "lil punk 
 Blame that on your father" 
 So I had no choice 
 Nigger, pick up a brick 
 Split a motherfucker shit's 
 For tryin' to fuck with the kid 
 Get a little older, hair on my dick, now I'm curious 
 Niggers on the corner gettin' money, rockin' jewelry 
 Allowance, nigger, that ain't man shit 
 Cowards, nigger that ain't man shit 
 I had to prove to myself 
 How these niggers same age as me 
 Calculatin' this wealth? 
 So I got me a click and niggers, what? 
 Workin' one sixteen, like nigger we can clean up 
 Follow My Life, homie, we starts it now 
 Only my motherfuckin' momma, nigger, holds me down 
 The Lord knows all the shit that I done put her through 
 I speak through her, straight to you, Motherfuckers 
 Follow My Life, homie, we starts it now 
 Only my motherfuckin' momma, nigger, holds me down 
 The Lord knows all the shit that I done put her through 
 I speak through her, straight to you, Motherfuckers 
 Two for one's 
 Here, take this 
 Two for one's 
 Quit switchin' dicks 
 Holler at me 
 See you fucker 
 Summer '94, I'm gettin' a little dough 
 Taller than my momma 
 So I'm listenin' to her knows 
 I'm listenin' to them hoes scream oh 
 And I'm listenin' to them O's go chop 
 People showin' pumpin' on the blocks, summertime 
 I call her Auntie, she cop three at a time 
 Throw an extra bump, bringin' cline 
 I'm so involved with the grind 
 I'm losin' my mind 
 Fuck a steady job, I'm tryin' 
 I steady mob, I'm dyin' in this game, I ain't lyin' 
 Sellin' so much coke, forgettin' it's a crime 
 Flyin' down I-75, pocket full of Dimes 
 Give a fuck about the radar on me 
 Bumpin' Biggie, Pac 
 Nigger, who tryin' me? 
 (Cop) Get off the God damn truck 
 (Obie) Yo, I ain't doin' shit 
 (Cop) Put your fuckin' hands in the air 
 (Obie) Bitch 
 Follow My Life, homie, we starts it now 
 Only my motherfuckin' momma, nigger, hold me down 
 The Lord knows all the shit that I done put her through 
 I speak through her, straight to you, Motherfuckers
