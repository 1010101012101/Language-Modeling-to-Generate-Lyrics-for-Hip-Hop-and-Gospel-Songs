"I don't see anything that could stand in our way..." 
 (I'm petty) Got my Gucci sneak's on 
 Gucci tee on, get my Gucci freak on 
 Everything I wear got a Gucci emblem 
 I'm so Gucci gone say I'm in a Gucci zone 
 (I'm petty) Got my Louie V hat 
 With my Louie backpack with the stacks in that 
 Where the Louie at? So you could pour another shot 
 Cause, everything I rock Louie V to the socks 
 Who do it hotter in Prada? 
 I ain't from N.Y., do it (M-Y Way), so Sinatra 
 You know my [?] not proper for the Oscars 
 But I opt out for the Oxfords in the Oxford 
 Ha ha, that hurts 
 Some'n by this oar got 'em tippin' they fedoras 
 Got the ladies bein whores 'cause we're ballin' out stores 
 I coordinate on everything I wore 
 So ladies know him now say, "That was him before" 
 Fresh as the core in my Christian Diors

 Gucci tee on, get my Gucci freak on 
 Everything I wear got a Gucci emblem 
 I'm so Gucci gone say I'm in a Gucci zone 
 (I'm petty) Got my Louie V hat 
 With my Louie backpack with the stacks in that 
 Where the Louie at? So you could pour another shot 
 'Cause, everything I rock Louie V to the socks 
 Got me smellin' like Chanel 
 Well, that's my female, shorty gets that mail 
 In them transparent 90-millimeter heels 
 In them Red Bottoms showin off them Christian Lou-B's 
 Heels... that's real 
 Everything 'bout her scream Dolce and Gabanna 
 With the bowlin ball bag showin out at Caribana 
 Lil' mama, she a stunner 
 Tweed dress on, no panties up under 
 Catch her on Queens Street ballin at the boutiques, holla

 BME, Black Market Entertainment 
 Obie Trice (Obie Trice, Obie Trice) 
 New shit... so bent 
 Guess the man lucky, she ain't glam luxury 
 We as a couple get (Fresher) than Douglas E. 
 Double up on my duds where the logos be 
 So Polo duplicate on me, guess that's why they hate Obie 
 They can see
