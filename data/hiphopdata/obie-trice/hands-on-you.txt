(Verse 1 - Obie Trice) 
 Baby I'm feeling the feelings you givin', I'm feelin' your style 
 N' I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out 
 I'm picturin your figure in a swimsuit whilin 
 Somewhere in the Caribbean islands 
 'Cause the vibe you giving me now 
 Feels like I'm a innocent child 
 A sinner whose never tempted when other womens around 
 Hands down this is my vow 
 I never heard a moan sound so profound 
 Wen a niggas diggin you out 
 The phone ring 
 U cuss them motherfuckers out 
 Quit calling the house 
 If I call you and rout 
 It's a drout you look out 
 I'm on edge you put the palm of ur hand on my head and squeeze 
 Please believe I ain't scared of commitment 
 Fuck head from them bitches 
 Wen you could do the same 
 But that respect is givin' 
 Our intimacy is significantly different 
 (Chorus - Eminem) 
 You gon' ride for me 
 Then I'm gon ride for u 
 If you put ur mouth on me 
 Imma put my mouth on u 
 Together there ain't nothing we can't do 
 Any problem we can see it through 
 Baby if you promise to be true 
 I will never put my hands on u 
 Come on and think about it 
 (Verse 2 - Obie Trice) 
 We ain't gotta talk wen we see eachother 
 We got it all chummed out wen we see eachother under them covers 
 You my lover, I'm your friend, I'm your man, but I'm sayin' 
 Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand 
 Visions of you havin' my little man 
 We joke, u call me george foreman 
 'Cause I'm namin him o numba fo', me I'm three 
 Cuss the ol' g like the personality she ses not to be 
 I'm in the bathroom wen you pee 
 She in the bathroom too wen a nigga doo-doo, u my boo-boo 
 There's nothing in this world a nigga wouldn't do to satisfy 
 Dis my bitch that ride 
 My bitch wit the pistol in the ride 
 A nigga act up, she bustin', she ain't got to decide, no discussion 
 She put a slug in a tough niggas muffin, u fucken wit her husband 
 (Chorus - Eminem) 
 (Verse 3 - Obie Trice) 
 Come and think about it 
 You got a ring about it 
 Nothing could ever come between 
 Or intervine our bondage 
 Drama, we overcome it if we out numbered 
 I promise it'll be us against a hundred 
 Rushing to ur side wen you vomit eating pickles and peanutbutter 
 8 months later obie rubbin ur stomach 
 Payin' homage to ur momma for raisin a girl proper 
 Enuf to call o her baby father 
 U ain't gotta bother 'bout a deal, I swear I keep it real 
 Raise young o (?) and cook a decent meal 
 Its signed and sealed, u the only female 
 Hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail 
 Post bail and post up for sale, I swore 
 I swear we will always live well 
 Long as I got my bombshell from the hood to the hills 
 Who gon' stop up, nobody, we's that deal 
 (Chorus - Eminem) 
 (Verse 4 - Eminem) 
 If you gon' stand by me 
 Then I'm gon' stand by u 
 If you promise ull be true 
 Then ill never put my hands on u 
 Don't you play me for no fool 
 'Cause if I put my mouth on u 
 After you put ur mouth on someone else 
 Better find someone else new 
 Come on and think about it
