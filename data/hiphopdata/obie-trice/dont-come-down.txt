 Don't come down things will always work out 
 Don't come down things will always work out 
 So when you find yourself in pieces 
 As a child I was fowl 
 (Uh) Ma, I couldn't understand them things that came out ya mouth (daddys ain't shit) 
 You would cuss, fuss till your blood pressure went up, then give up and slouch on the couch and drink ya liqor (fuck you dog) 
 A hard headed nigga I was quick temper short attention span not attending class (no) what a dummy 
 I would run over you honey 
 You confront me and say Obie you no longer have a mommy 
 Don't use my phone don't even eat my food 
 Matter a fact, Don't speak 
 And it was just me and you in that house with that mouse and them traps and that gat, waitin on the day for you to pull the 
 Trigger back 
 Don't come down things will always work out (I'm sorry) 
 Don't come down things will always work out (I messed up) 
 Don't come down things will always work out (Did wrong) 
 So when you find yourself in pieces

 It's the B blasted, bastard 
 Your lyin' (your lyin') 
 You took plastic freezer bags with dope inside of em 
 She knew, damn but she hated that it was true 
 I done raised two boys I can do away with you 
 The locks changed and the nights got colder 
 I'm slangin bolders lookin' like the bolda tolka 
 Fuck it I'm the obsta 
 I'm down for mounds ma, she ride by my corner 
 Like "I'm not gone cry (no) 
 I will not reek the pain of watchin my youngest man (no no no) 
 On the corners slangin cane 
 I'm callin the cops 
 Ma even though I left the house alone 
 I was seventeen years old on my own using these streets as my home (yeah) 
 There's no reason to prolong this beef dear I love you 
 Ms. Eleanor Trice I place no one above you 
 You the reason when I hustled I knew the stack 
 The reason when I opened up mics I knew to rip (rip dat) 
 The ethnics you instilled on this hectic young brother 
 Rubbed off after all 
 Now look at ya boy (Look) 
 When they ask about me now you don't gon just put ya head down 
 Straighten up ma you can smile now, proud 
 Everythings kosher with the boshterous obsta 
 Let's get closer 
 So regrets never aproach us
