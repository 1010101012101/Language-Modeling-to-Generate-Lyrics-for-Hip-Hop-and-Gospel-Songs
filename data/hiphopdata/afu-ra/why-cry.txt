Tell my why, why you wanna cry 
 Gentleman: 
 Nobody's crying out for justice 
 And everyone is crying out for peace 
 Mankind overstand please, a hungry man is an angry man 
 And the war will never cease militous power struggle 
 Make a whole a dem a freeze ya 
 And you a mister scripe and mister pharisees 
 Can you show some love and put your mind at ease 
 Say dem bow down to them flame like a beast them can't tame 
 And now you stand alone in a de rain 
 Afu-Ra: 
 All over the world, too much is too much 
 And I done been all over the globe, n yo, you know enough is enough 
 Many families going to bed without a decent meal in they table 
 Babies crying with these swollen bellies 
 And they can't help themselves, they need the world to hear me 
 It's fucked up, the population's mind shackled up 
 By some are mesmerized by a fucking pimp cup 
 With the zillionaire big time ballers 
 Every where in the world, put five in the bum's cup 
 And I ain't trynna scape-goat the power structure 
 Cause the powers structure's, heading for destruction 
 Matter of fact, yo it was built on destruction 
 I'm trynna look into the eyes of my brothers 
 Each one, teach one, we are all brothers 
 Get ya weight up, the situation ain't going nowhere 
 I can rhyme it till I'm blue in the face, who in the world cares 
 Gentleman: 
 It a run red out de 
 Everyday another innocent dead out de 
 More wickedness the whole a dem spread out de 
 And the ghetto youth a try and try and them can't find no bread out de 
 People upset out de 
 Politician nowadays na show regret out de 
 'Cause things dem a do we should reject out de 
 But instead of that 
 Nobody never fling a stone a flatten ghetto de 
 Afu-Ra: 
 We praise a spiritual vibe, to bring a state of unity 
 Mash the playa haters out in the community 
 And global genocide's, Babylon's comodity 
 While selficiousness, plagues the mind of humanity 
 With media and propaganda, causing insanity 
 And self indulgence tastin sweeter than candy 
 We got women, plus the men hypnotized by vanity 
 Understand, one race, one family 
 Gentleman: 
 You wanna be tender 
 But you got to be tough 
 Becuz the food that you eat 
 Look like it not enough 
 And you want to be real 
 But you got to be rough 
 And the whole time ya pray for a blessing from above boom 
 Mutton 'n' booze mashin handcuff 
 Working for de system the goods you a crush 
 And better you go cool and not fight the rush 
 Them step on your toe and not even say hush 
 Gentleman: 
 Nobody's crying out for justice 
 And everyone is crying out for peace 
 Mankind overstand please, a hungry man is a angry man 
 So the war will never cease militous power struggle 
 Make a whole a dem a freeze ya 
 And you a mister scripe and mister Pharisees 
 Can you show some love and put your mind at ease 
 Say them a bow down to them flame like a beast them can't tame 
 And now you stand alone in a de rain
