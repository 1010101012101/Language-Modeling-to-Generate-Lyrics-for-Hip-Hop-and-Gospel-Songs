(Intro: DJ Premier) 
 Yeah, Afu-Ra, the Body of the Life Force 
 Yo, you know how I do son (yeah) 
 Yeah, so why don't you (yeah) 
 Get on this mic and represent one time 
 (Afu-Ra) 
 Some MC's you know they artificial 
 Some get straight chewed like gristles, I blow like missiles 
 Lyrics run right through your tissues 
 Afu-Ra reformed serial killer, it's so much iller 
 How my sound rounds could bill-a 
 Straight up bodegas of thought ya come across 
 Rhymes so dope, one verse'll make you somersault 
 Intertwinin, alignin wit the timin 
 Enterprisin, uprisin surprisin 
 Perverted linguistics came to rip shit 
 Strapped for life word to mom's carry ten clips 
 My ink hits from backyards to basements 
 Loose lips sink ships, ya drown this quick 
 Superbly, my words be, like third degree 
 Word to me, thoughts higher than planes be 
 It's funny to me, how my stun shines the jewelry 
 My symmetry, follow me, wherever shadows be 
 Lyrical elixir, turntables and a mixer 
 Bust ya shit like a blister, yeah, one, two, how we do 
 (Chorus: DJ Premier scratches up samples) 
 "Afu-Ra"
