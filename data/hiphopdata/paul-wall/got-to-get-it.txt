Gotta get it 
 Gotta get it 
 I gotta get it, I gotta grind 
 I'ma put it down, gotta get mine 
 But you gotta get it, but you gotta grind 
 I'ma put it down, gotta get mine 
 I gotta get mine, gotta, gotta get mine 
 I'ma put it down, I gotta get mine 
 Gotta, gotta get mine, gotta, gotta get mine 
 I'ma put it down, I gotta get mine 
 I'm on the road to success, I strive to be the best 
 I never settle for less, if I'm broke I can't rest 
 A hustler in the flesh and I'm smokin' on the best 
 'Cause I deal with lots of stress, out here on this paper quest 
 I'm makin' progress and I'm blessed, oh yes 
 And I'ma get it to my last dyin' breath, then it's in peace I rest 
 I'm workin' with that bread like a chef when he cook 
 Now I'm back to flippin' paper like I'm readin' a book 
 Stayin' real with your partners, that's a real good look 
 But when your cash stash low all your boys get shook 
 I been searchin' for that paper like it's Natalie Holloway 
 Eight days a week plus I grind on holidays 
 There ain't no excuse for these boys to be broke 
 I know some hustlers in wheel chairs, we get it 'til we crock 
 From south po, to south postal, I gotta stack them C notes 
 So listen up close, say I gotta get it 
 I gotta get it, I gotta grind 
 I'ma put it down, gotta get mine 
 But you gotta get it, but you gotta grind 
 I'ma put it down, gotta get mine 
 I gotta get mine, gotta, gotta get mine 
 I'ma put it down, I gotta get mine 
 Gotta, gotta get mine, gotta, gotta get mine 
 I'ma put it down, I gotta get mine 
 I gotta get them dollar signs, all of every kind 
 Partner, I need mine even them nickels and them dimes 
 I'm out on the grind, stayin' every lick I find 
 Goin' get it myself, there ain't no time to try and stand in line 
 I never fall behind, and yeah, I'm full of that purple slim 
 But I ain't dead yet, I'm just fine 
 I'm still in my prime, so I pack at least a nine 
 'Cause these haters tryin' to block my shine 
 Like mini blinds, I gotta get it 
 Long as opportunity knock, I'ma get that gwop 
 And give it all that I got until my coffin drop 
 The sun rise I'm the first hustler on the block 
 And when the sun set, I'm still out here on the clock 
 I'm tryin' to hustle for them tickets like a traffic cop 
 I gotta hustle and get it partner, I never stop 
 I take that paper real serious like Dwight shoot 
 Stackin' up loot all around the sixteen route 
 I gotta get it, I gotta grind 
 I'ma put it down, gotta get mine 
 But you gotta get it, but you gotta grind 
 I'ma put it down, gotta get mine 
 I gotta get mine, gotta, gotta get mine 
 I'ma put it down, I gotta get mine 
 Gotta, gotta get mine, gotta, gotta get mine 
 I'ma put it down, I gotta get mine 
 I know the world in a recession, but I'm still progressin' 
 Take heed to my confession, never fall to oppression 
 I learn from life's lesson if you keep on pressin' 
 You'll eventually end up on top like salad dressin' 
 I'm never second guessin' like bye, bye faith 
 And however long the race gotta maintain pace 
 When the haters fall to waist, then my God grant grace 
 No matter what odds I face, I'ma be in first place 
 They hustle and the haste to feed expensive taste 
 But me I got grind out there on that paper chase 
 They turn they back on clements but I'm still gon' ride 
 Too many fish up in the water tryin' to float with the tide 
 No matter how high the gas price I'm still gon' drive 
 Quit cryin' and complainin' partner, swallow your pride 
 While you blamin' everybody for your same bad luck 
 I'ma be on the come up, sun down to sun up, I gotta get it 
 I gotta get it, I gotta grind 
 I'ma put it down, gotta get mine 
 But you gotta get it, but you gotta grind 
 I'ma put it down, gotta get mine 
 I gotta get mine, gotta, gotta get mine 
 I'ma put it down, I gotta get mine 
 Gotta, gotta get mine, gotta, gotta get mine 
 I'ma put it down, I gotta get mine
