I need my money, I need my cash 
 I need my cash, I need my cash 
 I need my cash 
 I need my money, I need my cash 
 I want it right here in my hand 
 Or that's your ass 
 I need my cake, I want my bread 
 If I don't get, I'm gonna bust you 
 In your head, in your head 
 I've been hustlin' on the grind 
 Slow motion on the krete 
 Posted on the corner 
 In my kicks and starch creased 
 Chasin' a meal ticket 
 So it's shortage on the sleep 
 I'm addicted to fast money 
 So there's boughta be us a steep 
 Peep the way a hustler move 
 Out earnin' my keep 
 But speak about my profit 
 And take smoke up out the heat 
 You playin' hide and seek 
 But them games need ta cease 
 If you rather we make peace 
 Then you break me off a piece 
 I need every piece of my cash 
 Put that paper in my fist 
 Better give me my interest 
 Or you be ceasin' to exist 
 I'm tired of all that runnin' 
 Time to man up and pay 
 I need retribution now 
 Or you'll be in for a bad day 
 I need my money, I need my cash 
 I want it right here in my hand 
 Or that's your ass, I need my cake 
 I want my bread 
 If I don't get, I'm gonna bust you 
 In your head, in your head 
 I've been on the grind 
 Chasin' paper all over the Texas state 
 From Dallas to San Antonio my resume is great 
 I've been holdin' my weight 
 For that paper I can't wait 
 Give me every dollar, you owe me 
 Partner, don't you dare be late 
 And look, make no mistake 
 I'm so serious about my paper stackin' 
 So get it straight 
 I'm so serious about this pistol packin' 
 No slackin', don't come up short 
 On not a single penny, yeah, I got plenty 
 'Bout you owe me o so many 
 Gimme them Benjamins and grants 
 Gimme them Jacksons and them Georges 
 Either you gonna bring me this bread 
 Or get lit up like torches 
 I need my money now partner 
 Come up off of my cake 
 Betta hook me up like bait 
 Or you'll be floatin' off in the lake 
 I need my money, I need my cash 
 I want it right here in my hand 
 Or that's your ass 
 I need my cake, I want my bread 
 If I don't get, I'm gonna bust you 
 In your head, in your head 
 I'm on tha grind increasin' the stock 
 With 6 O's in tha stash spot 
 With my mind on cash hand on glock 
 Gettin' money evading cops 
 Milk and honey, I need that guap 
 All that runnin', it's time to stop 
 Gimme that bread or get this lead 
 All that cash that big ol knot 
 You owe me 
 But you be actin' like you don't know me 
 But the next time I see you 
 Ya better have somethin' fo me 
 I'm hustlin', I'm grindin' 
 And I'm stackin' up that paper 
 I'm a bread breaker 
 Baby cake chaser money maker 
 My mind up on them 
 Dollas you neglectin' to pay 
 Any means by every way 
 I need my paper today 
 So gimme your watch, gimme your car 
 Even your socks or your shoes 
 It's time for you to pay your dues 
 Or you gon' lose pardna 
 I need my money, I need my cash 
 I want it right here in my hand 
 Or that's your ass 
 I need my cake, I want my bread 
 If I don't get, I'm gonna bust you 
 In your head, in your head 
 Gimme that
