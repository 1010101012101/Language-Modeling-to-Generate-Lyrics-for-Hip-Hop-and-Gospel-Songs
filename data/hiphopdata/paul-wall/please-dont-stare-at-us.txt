Show a big timer love when you see me ridin' dubs 
 Platinum chain diamond up but please don't stare at us 
 While you do I see you, peepin' me, I'm peepin' you 
 Find a better thing to do and please don't stare at us 
 Sittin' crooked on the chrome with a throwed yellow bone 
 I'm with her and you alone, please don't stare at us 
 Ice trays on my teeth, deep freeze around my neck 
 Betta get yo' mind correct and please don't stare at us 
 Mo' rocks than a dope fiend on my color changin' ring 
 In my color changin' car, I got color changin' screens 
 Somebody's watchin' I feel him breathin' from the sidewalk 
 Chameleon, when I park the car passed when my men talk 
 Do not tug on my pocket and then bug me about it 
 'Cause if I got it to give, I ain't stingy, I'll drop it 
 50 stash, half a hundred, cash checks and stay stuntin' 
 Exit my house with a gun to go get it like I'm huntin' 
 Eat lunch on platinum plates, platinum knife to stab steak 
 Who said money don't grow on trees? I rake my yard with platinum rakes 
 Pause, hold up, stop wait it's what they beg me to do 
 It's either Platinum FUBU or Iceberg with Pikachu 
 It's the fifty fifty twin, twenty three's when I spin 
 I say "You wanna lick my chain?" She say "You tease me again" 
 No key to the Benz 'cause it's voice activated 
 When my brother get off like I know haters have to hate it

 Here I come, turn your head, why you girl turnin' red? 
 You remind me of the type of person that would turn Fed 
 Turn your frown into a smile, she don't like you take a hint 
 Turn the corner, everybody stare at color changin' tint 
 A lot of money I spent to make blind people squint 
 I tipped a waiter enough money to pay for his rent 
 I hauled away, listen how my horn be oinkin' 
 My diamonds got more points than a point guard pointin' 
 I'm babelous them sunglasses better cover your eyes 
 I drive past, jaws drop and eyebrows rise 
 I hold it down like sprint's mouth lookin' like gold bricks 
 Lookin' like stalagtites, hangin' off my lips 
 I had aspirations of ballin' ever since I was six 
 My record's like mosquito bites every DJ wants to itch 
 And every time people starin' at Paul Wall's mix 
 They call an ambulance to help them get they face unfixed

 When it come to ridin' chrome, we some veteran pros 
 Matter of fact I'm livin' larger than David Letterman's nose 
 Don't play stupid and act like I never said it before 
 I'd rather chase a set of them foes instead of them hoes 
 Whoa Kimosabe find me in the Denali 
 Or hoppin' out the Impali if I'm sweatin' it's probably 
 Not the damn sun it's this heater strapped to my body 
 Whoa Kimosabe think I'm bluffin' then try me 
 Mirror, mirror in the car I'm watchin all of y'all 
 So I can see who's plottin' on me when my twankies crawl 
 You starin' at us dog, that boy Lu Hawk is not 
 The type to let some drama pop and just sit back and watch 
 Niggaz just sit back and watch while we sit back in drops 
 Haters see more red dots than a kid with chicken pox 
 If you want it its whatever you haters need to go get a 
 Life we cheddar getters for 2k1 and forever 
 Whoa Kemosabe get your dumb brain corrected 
 When you see a color changin' necklace you better respect it 
 Uh Huh
