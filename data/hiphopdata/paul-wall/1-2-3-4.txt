 Give me more lovin' then I've ever had. 
 Make it all better when I'm feelin' sad. 
 Tell me that I'm special even when I know I'm not. 
 Make me feel good when I hurt so bad. 
 Barely gettin' mad, 
 I'm so glad I found you. 
 I love being around you. 
 You make it easy, 
 As easy as 1 2,(1 2 3 4.) 
 There's only one thing two do three words four you. 
 I love you. 
 (I love you) 
 There's only one way two say those three words 
 And that's what I'll do. 
 I love you. 
 (I love you) 
 Give me more lovin' from the very start. 
 Piece me back together when I fall apart. 
 Tell me things you never even tell your closest friends.
