The Peoples champ baby 
 That be yours truly Paul Wall 
 You know what I'm talkin' bout 
 Gettin' this money all day and all night 
 And you know I'm flyer than a mosquito baby 'cause that's how I do 
 I got expensive taste you know what I'm talking bout 
 Sit back take notes already 
 I wake up in the morning and I yawn and stretch 
 Lace up some new J's now I'm new born fresh 
 Got the 501 jeans creased starched and pressed 
 Expensive taste name brand hat and shirt on my chest 
 Got the boppers going crazy pull up in my Mercedes 
 Knocking down the ladies from Pasadena to Katy 
 Most of them dudes hate me 'cause I sweet talking they lady 
 But don't bring her around me if your game ain't all gravy 
 No time for games my mind on stacking change 
 Tryin' to flip this paper and change this chevy to a range 
 Screen fall like rain as I maneuver the grain 
 I pull up 3 screens 4 twelves 5 swangs 
 Cadillac convert while my trunk do the jerk 
 And the speakers in the back are drumming like Neil Peart 
 Haters on high alert 3 ounces in the squirt 
 Perc 10s for dessert and Pimp C on my shirt 
 I I come around the corner so slow alert 
 When wood grain get worked all feelings get hurt 
 Gorilla poke swangers all up under the skirt 
 First place in the car show in the back getting slurped 
 I step on the dirt and stop traffic like a school bus 
 All eyes on me I'm fly as a flock of ducks 
 Chasing these big bucks Haters can suck nuts 
 They flaky as pie crust and sensitive as an Itouch 
 Put that on the hood the corner and the block 
 TV Johnny put 35 carats up on the watch 
 100 till my heart stops running this paper chasing 
 Draped in expensive taste my music is slow pace 
 Prada is on the face partner that's shades 
 And if its ain't 84s and vogues than its blades 
 Crisp new levis grinding since I was knee high 
 Need I say mo' fo sho you know we fly 
 Jordons on the toes when you see Paul Wall 
 Shopping spree at ?SL2? I crawls from the mall 
 Man I'm so fly no connections no jet lag 
 ?Parvay? carat stones I break them off bad 
 I'm a hustla chasing meal tickets on a daily basis 
 I gotta get it I'm chasing them big faces 
 I'm putting paper in my pocket all damn year 
 So I can pull out Maserati and put carats in my ear 
 The diamonds shine so clear never from Debeer 
 I holla at TV Johnny he the man round here 
 Partner I got my mind and on Dollar signs and signing checks 
 I thinking snow cones on ear mouth wrist and neck 
 I got the game in check and my wrist game's correct 
 The diamond watch so shinny call it time to reflect 
 I gotta call these shots partner I came to wreck 
 And if you owe me lil homie then its time to collect 
 I'm straped up like a baby in the car seat 
 All work all day all night and all week 
 No sleep a hustla up on the creep 
 Getting my cash up bread stacked extra steep, baby 
 Know what I'm talking bout 
 And if you got a problem with me getting my paper 
 Then hit me at my website www dot kiss my ass dot com

 Sweatshop I see you baby 
 P.F. James what up 
 My partner Skinhead Rob rolling it up

 T Barker I see you baby
