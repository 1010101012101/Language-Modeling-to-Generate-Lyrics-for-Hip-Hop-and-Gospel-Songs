(*Talking*) 
 Know I'm tal'n bout, already 
 I'm just saying though 
 It's going down, know I'm tal'n bout 
 (Know I'm tal'n bout) 
 I'm on the grind, know I'm tal'n bout 
 (Know I'm tal'n bout) 
 Every penny nickel and dime, well I still got time 
 Every dolla that I can find, know I'm tal'n bout 
 (Know I'm tal'n bout) 
 (Paul Wall) 
 I gotta get that money, I gotta get that cash 
 I gotta stack bread, 'cause I'm spending it fast 
 I got habits, that I just can't break 
 Just got a brand new car, cash on fifth gray 
 If I see it I want it, if I buy it I flaunt it 
 A Kenyon Martin high school jersey, worth at least five hundred 
 Everything I got authentic, from the clothes to the chain 
 A twenty thousand dolla mouth, man I love this game 
 Everything changed, when I started getting that money 
 From the land of milk and honey, when I smile it's sunny 
 Isn't it funny, how people say that money changed me 
 I ain't worried what they broke ass, think 'bout me 
 I'm riding on 83's, my rims are classic 
 24's under the Avalanche, looking Jurassic 
 Paint change like mirages, you don't know when you pass it 
 I'm big balling till I lay in a casket, already
