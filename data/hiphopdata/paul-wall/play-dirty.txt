Play Dirty 
 Like I slipped in mud before the game 
 And The Coach wouldn't even let a playa go change 
 Play Dirty 
 I talk more trash than Ali 
 I float like a butterfly and sting like a bee 
 Play Dirty 
 Break ya nose like Rodman did Pippen 
 The minute you start trippin', I'll slip the banana clip in 
 Play Dirty 
 Everything in life ain't fair so sometimes you gotta play dirty 
 Do you feel me on that there? 
 (50/50 Twin) 
 Man fuck a rule book cuddy I play dirty 
 I cook 2 on stovers when I cook birdies 
 I got tattoos white boxers T-shirts and slugs 
 If in the mirror then I'm fixin my mug 
 I put a nigga on the top floor 
 I beat him with a jack show him that I'm not a hoe 
 Fill an application out at papadeaux's 
 Work my way up to manager and rob the hoes 
 You never know what I'm gonna do next like a lava lamp 
 Pull out the pockets on the damn dada pants 
 Ridin' in a throwed lil car hotter than some fiya ants 
 I be actin' like Bin Laden I think I got a problem man 
 I ain't the baddest in the world but I'm the baddest you done seen 
 I want you out that car now pull over like trina 
 Ya patna owe me cash I'm gon get that bank 
 Put a bomb under the car and a twist in the gas tank what 
 (Paul Wall) 
 Catch me at the club with a clutch at my waist 
 If a hata run up I leave a scuff on his face 
 Blood on his face get drug through a lake 
 For goodness sake invite the hood to his wake 
 Banana in ya tail pipe sugar in ya tank 
 Dis combobulate ya fuel pump when ya car crank 
 Swallow up ya fear break a bottle on a chair 
 Grab a model by the hair when you holla in the air 
 Girl give me your number or I'll steal ya car 
 Lew hawk at the bar robbing mone from the tip jar 
 Throw ya neighborhood up if you ain't barrin 
 And if a busta hold the place don't sit there and ignore it 
 Break a hata nose dismantle his jaw 
 Them Hollywood Boys gon handle the bar 
 If he tries to make a move then take him to the lot 
 Trunk pop stash pot with the automatic glock
