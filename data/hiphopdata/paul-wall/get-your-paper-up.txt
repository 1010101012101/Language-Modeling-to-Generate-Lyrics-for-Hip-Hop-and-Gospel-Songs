Ay gon' salute me, I don't flip, neva that 
 But I know how to get it, I know where the money at 
 Them haters talkin' down, still I'm comin' up 
 I get money, stay true, get your paper up 
 They see me, posen' 
 Ridin' fresh with the paint, doors open 
 Them haters talkin' down, still I'm comin' up 
 I get money, stay true, get your paper up 
 It's Paul Wall baby, Swishahouse Spokesman 
 I'm crushing all competition like a coke can 
 I'm with that Damon Jones Mix-O and Black Lac 
 In that Lac with the trunk cracked, I'm swingin' 
 Until the swingers collapse, I'm back, I'm stuntin' 
 Comin' down on gold tires, I'm on the block, holdin' it down 
 Like some [unverified] I keep the swingers pokin' 
 I got the windows open, white cup with somethin' potent 
 Wood wheel still what I'm chokin' 
 I'm on that Antwaan with Lou, Hawk 
 And Freddie Thug, dismantle them mics 
 And make their heads bobb, that's my job 
 My mind on stackin' a wad, these boys out here chasin' 
 Broads, look close, it's no mirage 
 I got somethin' for all them frauds 
 Ay gon' salute me, I don't flip, neva that 
 But I know how to get it, I know where the money at 
 Them haters talkin' down, still I'm comin' up 
 I get money, stay true, get your paper up 
 They see me, posen' 
 Ridin' fresh with the paint, doors open 
 Them haters talkin' down, still I'm comin' up 
 I get money, stay true, get your paper up 
 I'm on the block holdin' posts like Jermaine O' Neal 
 No ice grill, just cold steel, that's a gangsta grill 
 I'm down for that drama so I'm known to pack a cannon 
 A sharp seein' hittin' targets like Peyton Manning 
 And you can catch me in the hood like a liquor store 
 Roll those dice, let's get that dough, I'm 6-8, I'm 10-4 
 I got that Tish from black, that tip got my back 
 I put them elbows under the Lac and know they plottin' ta jack 
 Boppers don't know how to act 
 I'm leanin' back and countin' stacks 
 Postin' up on big wheels, still tippen lex's don't get distressed 
 I'm out here chasin' banks, breakin' bread 
 And sippin' drank, accumulating, my Benz taste 
 My mind straight and my paper chase 
 Ay gon' salute me, I don't flip, neva that 
 But I know how to get it, I know where the money at 
 Them haters talkin' down, still I'm comin' up 
 I get money, stay true, get your paper up 
 They see me, posen' 
 Ridin' fresh with the paint, doors open 
 Them haters talkin' down, still I'm comin' up 
 I get money, stay true, get your paper up 
 My vision's nocturnal so I'm grindin' all night 
 I gotta cup that's rather purple so it's oil and it's Spirte 
 I got some partnas in the cage, I be shootin' them kites 
 Them other guys is all hype 
 Tell them suckas take a hike baby, you see these future 
 Locs, you see them hundred spokes 
 I'm on posters just one deep, ya get it, coast to coast 
 I'm slabbin' candy drops, punchin' clocks 
 And slammin' broads, I got money like Reggie Bush 
 My billboard got a lotta yards, I'm with that Poppa Joe 
 I got dro on da low, I keep tha lean for a month or so 
 But I'm back on it, I can't let go 
 I'm down with T.Farris and G.Dat, we switchin' glass 
 Some of these boys ain't lastin' we still right here countin' cash 
 Ay gon' salute me, I don't flip, neva that 
 But I know how to get it, I know where the money at 
 Them haters talkin' down, still I'm comin' up 
 I get money, stay true, get your paper up 
 They see me, posen' 
 Ridin' fresh with the paint, doors open 
 Them haters talkin' down, still I'm comin' up 
 I get money, stay true, get your paper up
