I got (?) on my ride in the black 
 I Bet you if I turn you baby I can make 'em bop 
 Got me saying 
 Who the fuck you be bitch you know me 
 Who the fuck who-who the fuck you be bitch you know me 
 I'm sum'n like a pimp (x2) 
 (Paul Wall:) 
 (Making 'em bop) 
 I'm sitting down in pimp mode 
 My trunk bump like a lymph node 
 Them boppas gaze and haters haze 
 I'm playa made with hemp roll 
 I pull up and make them wimps fold 
 My wide body big blimp hoes 
 That fifth drop down look to the floor 
 The trunk glow I'm so dope 
 I'm candy red like Elmo 
 Me a simp Oh hell no 
 Just ask your girlfriend she'll know 
 I got her stuck like Velcro 
 I put 'em under my spell bro 
 My mackin' game is real cold 
 I'm crawling round the parking lot 
 In a 'lac dialup Dell slow 
 Catch a glimpse of this thug prince 
 With purple rain up in my cup 
 When it get tense I never flinch 
 That hunter pinch is by my gut 
 What the fuck oh that's a nine 
 That broad with me oh that's a dime 
 That cadillac that's double parked 
 Dripping stains oh yeah that's mine 
 Boys know that I'm bout that bread 
 Boppas know they got to give head 
 Haters know 'bout the infrared 
 That leave 'em dead and full of that lead 
 I'm one hundred and full of bread 
 I'm Paul Wall 
 I'll hold it down 
 You know me I'm getting mine 
 That paper and them dimes
