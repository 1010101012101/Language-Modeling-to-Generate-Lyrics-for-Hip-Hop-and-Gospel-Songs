I got the heart of a hustler 
 The mind of a g 
 I'm out here gettin' my paper 
 So don't fuck wit me 
 I wake up in the morning when the sun rise 
 I got my mind on paper chasing them dollar signs 
 It aient no time for resting or taking naps 
 I got to have something so I'm counting all paper stacks 
 I got dreams and asperations of ballin big 
 I want a crib in the hills out there where kobe live 
 And I can get it if I put my grind to it 
 Quit making excuses up and get out there and do it 
 Aient no time for games when your chasing after change 
 But you can face some cause that paper and close range 
 My mind on a range fly chains and diamonds rings 
 My skills are making bills with profit and high game 
 Ridin' the fast lane that paper in my vision 
 My mind on a mil ticket I'm chasing that commission 
 Money is my mission give me all I can get 
 Until they put me in a grave man I just can't quit 
 I got the heart of a hustler 
 I got the mind of a g 
 I'm out here gettin' my paper 
 So don't fuck wit me 
 Don't fuck around man 
 That's right doin' and moving 
 White linen on my tuff tails 
 Not an illusion three sheets to the wind 
 I aient gotta be boozen go bad on a bitch 
 Till I got her improvment no I'm not wit the losing 
 I'm dying to win I'm goin' try it again I'm goin' cry for my sins 
 I live the fast life yeah and I'm not stoppin' 
 For shit bitch half a tank of crank and a plot to get rich 
 I got money out my mind likes it's a price out my hat 
 Still smokin' even though my lung twice to collapse 
 I'm right back with the sack then I'm buring the shern 
 You know 
 Better learn still yernin to earn 
 And really I don't listien when I talk to myself 
 So how the fuck you think that ima listen to somebody else 
 It's a fast life ho you know like pushin and shit and when I run up out of gas then I'm pushin this bitch 
 I got heart of a hustler 
 I got the mind of a g 
 I'm out here gettin' my paper 
 So don't fuck wit me 
 I grind hard from the second I awake 
 When you play wit high stakes you profit at high rate 
 Nomore top roman I'm tryin' to eat steaks 
 So I get up off my bump and go get that cake 
 It aient no time for sleep 
 If you snooze you loose if you broke it mean your lazy 
 That's the choice you choose 
 If you grind and you complaining and you wastin your time 
 Better correct your mind suck it up and go grind 
 Its money to be made when my phone ring ring 
 I'm not to impressed wit all the bling bling 
 I'm much more motivated by all the ching ching 
 Been grindin since kidagarden back then it was a dream 
 Its money over everything family first 
 They goin' to bury me a g and bost swangas on the hurst 
 I'm on the block posted making money dispurse I thrist for dollar bills bein broke is the worst 
 I got the heart of a hustler 
 I got the mind of a g 
 I'm out here gettin' my paper 
 So don't fuick wit me
