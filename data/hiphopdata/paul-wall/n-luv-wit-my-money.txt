(Chorus: Chamillionaire singing) 
 Big Swangaz and Vouges 
 Them 20 inches sittin' low 
 We Ball 24's 7's all that we know 
 Screens and neon lights gon show 
 When my trunk unlock pop and show 
 Ya already know 
 Paint drippin off the door 
 Not Engaged with no lady, fall in love with 'em no! 
 You may think I'm crazy never knew this type of love before 
 I'm love with my foreign, yes I'm married to my dough... 
 I"m in love with my money... mmmm 
 (Paul Wall) 
 Hold on hold up a second man 
 I never mack to a metro dame 
 You better respect the game 
 See my gecko chain and correct ya brain 
 I love my car like it was my girlfriend I like to carress the grain 
 Followed the wheel and I got aroused 
 Swung in the ditch and I wrecked the frame 
 Broke up with my foreign car and fell in love with my cadillac 
 The Ringling Brothers enquired to how my trunk turns flips like an acrobat 
 I act a rat, 'cause I'm from the gutter 
 Ya girl stutter when I pull up next to ya 
 You been with the girl 6 months Paul Wall 
 Is the reason she won't give sex to ya 
 Why all that plex in ya 
 'Cause a German company made my rims 
 My big body's pregant with twins I'm bout to induce a baby benz 
 Ya car was fly in the hood but my candy paint just wet ya flames 
 I'm sittin' on 22 inch baby sitters babelous threatin ya name 
 Forgot to change the diaper so when I crept in the lane I left a stain 
 Everytime it rains, paint drips and leaves a stain and I get the blame 
 My TV's are the pet I train I can make 'em roll over and play dead 
 My car was blue on the freeway 
 But when I stopped at the light it changed to red 
 You betta re arrange ya head thinkin' I trick my cash to a broad... 
 Go ahead and ask ya broad I got more green than the grass in a yard 
 And that's so raw It ain't hard for me to get the class to applaud 
 I shine like a blasting star, pushing a car more blacker than tar
