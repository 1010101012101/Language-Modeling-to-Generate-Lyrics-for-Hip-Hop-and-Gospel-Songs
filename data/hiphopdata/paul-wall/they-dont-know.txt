 They don't know what that scar bout' 
 They don't know what that bar bout' 
 They don't know what that candy car bout' 
 Or smokin' that joint about 
 Texas is the home of the playas and pimps 
 Showin' naked ass in the great state of Tex' 
 3rd Coast Born I mean we're Texas raised 
 (Texas muthafucka that's where I stay) 
 (Paul Wall) 
 All ready! 
 What you know about swangaz and vogues 
 What you know bout' purple drank 
 What you know bout' poppin' trunk, neon lights, candy paint 
 What you know about white shirts, starched down jeans with a razor crease 
 Platinum and gold on top our teeth, big ol' chains with a iced out piece 
 You don't know bout' Michael Watts 
 You don't know about DJ Screw 
 What you know about "MAN! Hold UP", I done came down and what it do? 
 They don't know about P.A.T 
 What you know bout' FREE PIMP C 
 What you know bout' the Swishahouse man 
 What you know bout' the S.U.C 
 We keep it playa, ain't no fake 
 When we holdin' plex whenever haters hate 
 We listen to music screwed and chopped 
 Down here in this Lone Star state 
 Outta towners be comin' around 
 Runnin' they mouth and talkin' down 
 But you don't know nothin' bout my town 
 Either hold it down or move around

 Mike jones! 
 Me and Paul we actin' a fool 
 When screens fall I'm packin' a tool 
 I'm Texas raised, Texas made 
 We grind daily no minimum wage 
 I represent the home of candy cars 
 Screw music and purple bar 
 Trunk bangin', fifth hangin' 
 84's and vogue swangin' 
 Belt-buckles we wear in Texas 
 Rag-tops lay down on Lexus 
 Diamonds shinin' from grillin' necklace 
 Haters hate 'cause we well respected 
 Paul Wall and Mike Jones 
 Who one of the throwedest on the microphone 
 We sittin' high on 20 inch chrome 
 Tryin' to get our shine on 
 I said, Paul Wall and Mike Jones 
 Who one of the throwedest on the microphone 
 We sittin' high on 20 inch chrome 
 Tryin' to get our shine on 
 I crack a smile and show platinum mouth 
 Every time I rap I rep Swishahouse 
 I spit a verse and head straight to the vaults 
 5 G's for me to even open my mouth

 All Ready! 
 Hold on, hold up a second 'cause 
 Boys comin' down blue or red 
 Down here pimpin' ain't dead 
 Grindin' daily to stack my bread 
 I from the place where girls jump fly 
 Now a days the brauds pimp brauds 
 'Cause they got more game then most these guys 
 You'll get set up and then you'll get robbed 
 You don't know bout' chunkin' a deuce 
 You don't know 'bout a southside fade 
 Down here we be ridin' d's 
 But you don't know about choppin blades 
 Texas southern or Prarie View 
 What you know bout' battle of the bands 
 Down here we got ghetto girls 
 Like wings, chicken or Timmy Chan's 
 You can catch me ridin' swangs 
 What you know about sippin' syrup 
 You don't know about pourin' it up 
 Purple drank some speeches slurred 
 You don't know bout' the way we talk 
 Boys say we got country words 
 But I don't really care what you heard 
 'Cause you don't know bout' the Dirty 3rd
