 I must admit. 
 I like 'em dark skin, light skin, thick and thin 
 I like 'em every shape, and all types of shades of skin 
 I like them big thies, slim waist, and pretty eyes 
 You got my hormones on the rise so come her girl for this big surprise 
 Some ladies like it slow, some ladies like it ruff, some like it kinky with them blindfolds and hand-cuffs
