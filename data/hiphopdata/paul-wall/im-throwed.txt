Jermaine Dupri: 
 Y'all know what this is 
 When I'm on that beat I'm a beast 
 I ain't never came weak 
 Got a mouth full of diamonds 
 You can hardly hear me speak 
 Especially when it sound like dis (dis) 
 It's that H-Town baby and you know what it is 
 I'm throwed 
 Got styrofoam cup full of bar 
 I'm throwed 
 Four deep in my old school car 
 I'm throwed 
 Show Cali why I'm bangin' the screw 
 It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do 
 I'm throwed 
 Paul Wall: 
 I'm Fresher than a fruit bowl 
 Leanin like a gas gage 
 Straight up off the dome, freestylin like hair braids 
 Makin' that candy dance, I'm throwed off the Cali plants 
 I'm prancin' on the scene crawlin down like fire ants 
 My mind in a trance, I'm, sharper than a starched pants 
 Stackin Franklin and Grants from South Bank to Spring Branch 
 I'm posted like a stamp with my mind on cash 
 I'm wheel grippin and still tippin Brandi wine on glass 
 I got a screen in the dash, a quarter tank full of gas 
 Smokin' that puff puff pass, throwed I hope I don't crash 
 Reppin the Swisha blast, so I'm flyer than a mockingbird 
 Throwed in the mode game, cold as a iceburg baby 
 When I'm on that beat I'm a beast 
 I ain't never came weak 
 Got a mouth full of diamonds 
 You can hardly hear me speak 
 Especially when it sound like dis (dis) 
 It's that H-Town baby and you know what it is 
 I'm throwed 
 Got styrofoam cup full of bar 
 I'm throwed 
 Four deep in my old school car 
 I'm throwed 
 Show Cali why I'm bangin' the screw 
 It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do 
 I'm throwed 
 Paul Wall: 
 Now to broads I'm a sharp-shooter like Steve Kerr 
 Flash the wrists cause a blur 
 Fox fur and flyin spur 
 Undisputed for sure 
 So I'm collectin these dimes 
 Name and number lil momma 'cause its checkout time 
 I'm slidin on glass threes, inhalin the chronic trees 
 Pack protection 'cause player hatin' spread like STD's 
 I'm cool as a ocean breeze, like Chester I'm chasin cheese 
 I'm stangin like buzzin bees, on south lee with the cheese 
 Screens fall like all them leaves makes the TV's rain 
 Take a picture if you please, yeah my wrist is insane 
 Thirty Karot, diamond chain, so ballin is off the chain 
 Mind frame I'm stackin change, I'm so throwed in the game 
 When I'm on that beat I'm a beast 
 I ain't never came weak 
 Got a mouth full of diamonds 
 You can hardly hear me speak 
 Especially when it sound like dis (dis) 
 It's that H-Town baby and you know what it is 
 I'm throwed 
 Got styrofoam cup full of bar 
 I'm throwed 
 Four deep in my old school car 
 I'm throwed 
 Show Cali why I'm bangin' the screw 
 It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do 
 I'm throwed 
 Paul Wall: 
 I'm throwed in the game 
 I'm full of that purple sprite, and I'm searchin for broads 
 Paper stackin so my money stretch like extension cords 
 I'm a wide body rocker in a four on them choppers 
 I'm on the grind stackin up my mail like the post office 
 Movin at slow pace with T Farris, my ace 
 Cup full of expensive taste, open mouth and showcase 
 I'm throwed with screens hangin', swangin breakin his trust 
 We pourin up in them cups that stuff got me leanin tough 
 Hold up 
 I'm caked up so all the boppers attract I got 'em like Asaffa Powell there runnin' the track 
 Pullin capers makin' paper stacks fly as a dove 
 A bread breaker, taste maker baby 
 All of the above, I'm throwed 
 When I'm on that beat I'm a beast 
 I ain't never came weak 
 Got a mouth full of diamonds 
 You can hardly hear me speak 
 Especially when it sound like dis (dis) 
 It's that H-Town baby and you know what it is 
 I'm throwed 
 Got styrofoam cup full of bar 
 I'm throwed 
 Four deep in my old school car 
 I'm throwed 
 Show Cali why I'm bangin' the screw 
 It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do 
 I'm throwed
