(Chorus: paul wall) 
 Money ain't a thang paper ain't nothin' 
 When you're in a black mayback on buttons 
 Cutting these pops got dimes by the dozen 
 Higher than a kite and I'm a keep on puffin 
 Money ain't a thang paper ain't nothin' 
 When you're in a black mayback on buttons 
 Cutting these pops got dimes by the dozen 
 Higher than a satellite and I'm a keep on puffin 
 Cause money ain't a thang 
 (Verse 1: paul wall) 
 In all black like a funeral 
 Hustling all night to stack numeros 
 Serve them up something wrong like a kunero 
 I'm in love with dead men but no bruno bro 
 I'm talking presidents fresher then peppermints 
 Grinding till you working on your worker consettlement 
 My settlements get money and keep it trill 
 And I ain't stopping till the earth stays still 
 A wild one for real my grind never yeal 
 Paper chasing while you with your girl watching dr phil 
 And fuck how you feel what you thinking and say 
 Get you wig split open like a filet 
 (Chorus: paul wall) 
 Money ain't a thang paper ain't nothin' 
 When you're in a black mayback on buttons 
 Cutting these pops got dimes by the dozen 
 Higher than a kite and I'm a keep on puffin 
 Money ain't a thang paper ain't nothin' 
 When you're in a black mayback on buttons 
 Cutting these pops got dimes by the dozen 
 Higher than a satellite and I'm a keep on puffin 
 Cause money ain't a thang 
 (Verse 2: jim jones) 
 Hoodies and chests uh blow 
 I'm back from the death like the crow 
 All black trucks strapped up like fo fo 
 I'm all one act up there here I go 
 And that's just the wanted black maserlagi 
 That's just the phone we like to party 
 Dausk to the morning I got a man deep like a coffin 
 The pink dolphins got him freaking like caution 
 The vs are awesome we spitting all you see is exhaustion 
 I'm paranoid detour touring home 
 We don't say two wongs on the same phone 
 That's how the games dumb 
 (Chorus: paul wall) 
 Money ain't a thang paper ain't nothin' 
 When you're in a black mayback on buttons 
 Cutting these pops got dimes by the dozen 
 Higher than a kite and I'm a keep on puffin 
 Money ain't a thang paper ain't nothin' 
 When you're in a black mayback on buttons 
 Cutting these pops got dimes by the dozen 
 Higher than a satellite and I'm a keep on puffin 
 Cause money ain't a thang 
 (Verse 3: paul wall) 
 Time flys when you're dancing on the clouds 
 Grills got 'em seeing stars swear it was tinsletown 
 I'm holding it down profile is profound 
 And profit for seeing profit post it ten toes down 
 See I get it year round I serve 'em like supenas 
 On the meal boat tippy toe struting like ballerinas 
 Fresher then the cleaners 8 series beamers 
 If you jealous and hating you can eat our whole penis 
 TV johnny p's mouth piece reign 
 Educated dime giving einstein brains 
 I'm a get mine snow summer and rain 
 And now I'm clocking my game 
 Hold up lane 
 (Chorus: paul wall) 
 Money ain't a thang paper ain't nothin' 
 When you're in a black mayback on buttons 
 Cutting these pops got dimes by the dozen 
 Higher than a kite and I'm a keep on puffin 
 Money ain't a thang paper ain't nothin' 
 When you're in a black mayback on buttons 
 Cutting these pops got dimes by the dozen 
 Higher than a satellite and I'm a keep on puffin 
 Cause money ain't a thang
