This girl is on fire (she's hot) 
 She's on fire (she's hot) 
 She is burnin' up in the club now 
 Stop, drop it and roll 
 (Akon) 
 Shawty got a nice, pressed beautiful body 
 'N anytime I see her she be lookin' for a party 
 Nice 'lil ghetto attitude and naughty 
 Damn baby you could be my shawty 
 E'rybody wanna break, they just can't hang 
 Imma be the one to ride the midnight train 
 Jump on the track, wanna just get started 
 Make the 'chu chu', wanna touch that body 
 Tell me babygirl, can you stand that heat? 
 Like gasoline and ??? 
 A little reaction, is all I need 
 Start a 'lil bit F-I-R-E 
 Make me wanna come at you a 'lil bit harder 
 Know your type, you're a 'lil bit smarter 
 The girl so hot, man gives us some water 
 Let's go, water
