They're trying to block my shine 
 Doing whatever they can to stop my grind (ey ey) 
 They hate seeing my stacks getting tall 
 And even though they plotting on my downfall 
 I'm still on (still on) 
 I'm still on (still on) 
 Go ahead tell them haters I'm still on (still on) 
 I'm still on (still on) 
 (Verse 1: paul wall) 
 I'm tired of being broke something gotta shape 
 I'm a get off my ass and go get that cake 
 All hours of the day the hustling never stop 
 So from sun up to sun down I'm punching the clock 
 While them other boys sleeping I'm on the grind creeping 
 When the daylight dawns in all hours of the evening 
 They peeping through my window tryin' to see what I got 
 ? Hustling on the side partna I think not 
 Tryin' to plot on a jack move the haters is watching 
 And the law is looking at me cause the fours I'm coppin 
 But ain't no way I'm stopping I done worked too hard 
 And I ain't paid too far so there's no hoes barred 
 My back against the wall and my hand on the gun 
 But I pray to god for peace so thou should overcome 
 When victory is won and my crib on the lake 
 I ain't never gonna stop grinding after getting that cake 
 They're trying to block my shine 
 Doing whatever they can to stop my grind (ey ey) 
 They hate seeing my stacks getting tall 
 And even though they plotting on my downfall 
 I'm still on (still on) 
 I'm still on (still on) 
 Go ahead tell them haters I'm still on (still on) 
 I'm still on (still on) 
 (Verse 2: paul wall) 
 They talking down on a playa 'cause I'm breaking bread 
 But would you rather I be on my ass broke instead 
 Everybody jealous of you when you're paperspread 
 But they quick to wear your t-shirt when you're dead 
 It's just in me to be a go getta 
 Tied at hard times partna I wanna live better 
 You know ain't nothing coming to a youngn sleep up your dreams 
 So I'm swallowing them no dose and leading my team I want that green 
 And ain't nobody gonna stand in my way 
 I give a fuck what a hater say 
 Let them other boys play 
 Go and get everyday from home staying to the tray 
 If I work hard then good times are on the way 
 I know alot of these haters just want me out the way 
 But not today the champ here to stay 
 I live the fast life daily that paper what I need 
 While them haters falling off the lazyiness and greed 
 But I'm still on baby 
 They're trying to block my shine 
 Doing whatever they can to stop my grind (ey ey) 
 They hate seeing my stacks getting tall 
 And even though they plotting on my downfall 
 I'm still on (still on) 
 I'm still on (still on) 
 Go ahead tell them haters I'm still on (still on) 
 I'm still on (still on) 
 (Verse 3: paul wall) 
 While other people in bed trying to count sheep 
 I'm clocking dollars counting paper out there in the street 
 The people hating they judge me 'cause I'm ballin hard 
 I guess they rather I out house to house mowing yard 
 You see the cadillac and benz parked out in the yard 
 When I pull out in that bentley coupe I fool all their cards 
 I fool broads for years I'm talking down pieces 
 And now I'm pulling my hand away from all the reaches 
 Focused all my thoughts on paper stacking 
 I'm with t-farris everyday and we ainy never slacking 
 I'm out here racking these meal tickets I ain't quitting 
 So get to packing if you're on your ass bullshitting 
 They steady knock me for making money ain't counting change 
 But I ain't changed when I was broke I acted the same 
 And now they're jealous but fuck 'em tell 'em kiss my ass 
 Sun up to sun down I'm getting that cash 
 Tell 'em I'm still on 
 (Chorus/outro: paul wall talking in background) 
 They're trying to block my shine 
 Doing whatever they can to stop my grind (ey ey) 
 They hate seeing my stacks getting tall 
 And even though they plotting on my downfall 
 I'm still on (still on) 
 I'm still on (still on) 
 Go ahead tell them haters I'm still on (still on) 
 I'm still on (still on)
