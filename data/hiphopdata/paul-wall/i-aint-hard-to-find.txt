If ya lookin' for me I ain't hard to find 
 I'll be right there posted on that 59 
 I got a burner in my lap at all times 
 And a bag of sticky-icky green limes 
 I got that paper in them rubberbands stacked up 
 And I got somethin' hidden in the stash wrapped up 
 If you see purple in my cup that mean I'm leanin tough 
 I got them haters on my back so I be strapped up 
 I'm in a league of my own while them haters throw stones 
 But my mind on cash, I'm in the zone 
 I'm grippin wood and tippin chrome 
 I'm well known, my wrist is rocky like Stalone 
 Southlea is where I roam 
 The champ is here and there is no clone 
 Off top, I'm well respected on many blocks 
 So I'm pullin hunnies and smashin cocks 
 Knockin' these broads up out they socks 
 I'm in the hood like wig shops 
 Look close - I ain't hard to spot 
 I'm right there at that gamblin spot 
 Stackin up a fat not 
 I'm a block burner like Lil Wayne 
 Revisin the game like King James 
 The heads turnin' like Slim Thug chain 
 I'm bangin' hooks like Sugar Shane 
 I'm thowed off like Major Payne 
 Talkin' shit like Clubber Lang 
 These boys talkin' down on the name, 
 But they all washed up like Eddie Kane 
 The slab roof like David Blaine - it disappear like magic 
 Glock nineteen, made of plastic - might stretch ya out just like elastic 
 I stay up on my toes till the day that my casket close 
 Bankrolls and fine hoes, fancy cars and starch clothes 
 Weed cigars and Moet rolls, pints of barre and kushy dro 
 Dime collector outside the club in candy toy with the trunk exposed 
 Swishahouse baby that's my crew 
 Roll with us or you'll get ran through 
 We loved by few and still true 
 Let me tell y'all just what it do 
 Its Hustle-town Texas 
 I do this for the streets 
 Grindin with no sleep because that paper what I seek 
 That hatin' need to cease 
 I'm evadin the police 
 And I been hustlin since Hulk Hogan body slammed the Iron Sheik 
 My flow is outta sight, but them boys is all hype 
 They can't see me up on the mic 
 So they be hatin' me out of spite 
 Some potent purple Sprite 
 I done paid my dues 
 Out hear the strong survive, but the weak end up on Fox news 
 Sleepless nights with burner in hand cause nowadays them jackers plot 
 Jealousy turn friends to foes I'm packin Glocks around the clock 
 Stackin nots and mackin hoes 
 Chasin paper and ridin' vogues 
 Get that dough what I propose 
 On five-nine double-O
