(Feat. Fat Joe, Lil' Keke, & Slim Thug) 
 Whut It Dew? 
 Bling bling, bling bling, bling bling 
 John-John-Johnny dang watch froze 
 Johnny dang watch froze 
 (Ok, Swisha House) bling bling, bling bling, bling bling 
 Johnny dang watch froze (Paul Wall baby) 
 Johnny dang watch froze 
 (Verse 1: Paul Wall) 
 I got that diamond ice up on my ears, in tha grill and on my watch 
 Neck and wrist off vvs, while all da cotton cats just watch 
 Sellin grills, workin wheels and workin deals all cross da globe 
 5 carat on one ear lobe, cause that's how Texas ballas roll 
 Neck froze, my wrist is cold, I'm iced out, and turnin' heads 
 Hurtin' feelins and settin trends, with shinnin grin I'm breakin bread 
 I'm off tha chain, I'm outta sight, I'm shinnin light all through da dark 
 I put on my chain in South Park, and you can see it in Heim Clark 
 Iced out by Johnny Dang, my wrist wear is offly throwed 
 Chasin gwap, I'm screwed and chopped, with flip flop on candy load 
 Brandy wine on 84, drivin' slow with opened trunk 
 Bangin' screw, Whut It Dew? 
 I'm breakin off all of deez chumps 
 I got that TV Johnny watch on my hand patna, I'm stoppin' traffic when I smile I'm tha man patna 
 I got tha streets talkin' every time I flash tha chain, here I come put on ya shades 
 It's Paul Wall and Johnny Dang! 
 Flash tha wrist, got tha Johnny Dang watch froze 
 5 carat VV yella stone in my ear lobe 
 Flash tha wrist, got tha Johnny Dang watch froze 
 5 carat VV yella stone in my ear lobe 
 (Verse 2: Lil Keke) 
 (Let's go) 20 carats on my neck, watch tha chain swang 
 Wrist froze on dem hoes Mr. Johnny Dang 
 I got them bedrocks, flinstones in da ear 
 Neva fall, money tall, ball all year 
 I'm in tha 5-50 coupe so I push quick 
 Cranberry paint, rims tall as Bushwick 
 I wear da crown in H-Town, my stompin ground 
 Hataz face lit, tha bracelet, it weigh a pound 
 Prolly commin down with Paul Wall grill gleamin 
 Got a 8 of dat liquid gold we still leanin 
 Platinum white, catch me rose or da yella watch 
 Cause Mr. Johnny Dang take care of da jewelry box 
 Getcha game right, ice tight or bag back 
 Tha piece cash money, da Lac stay all black 
 It's Don Ke baby, TF we on da mash 
 Screwed Up Click homie, South Park and Swisha Blast 
 Flash tha wrist, got tha Johnny Dang watch froze 
 5 carat VV yella stone in my ear lobe 
 Flash tha wrist, got tha Johnny Dang watch froze 
 5 carat VV yella stone in my ear lobe
