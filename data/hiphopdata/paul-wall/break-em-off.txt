I'mma break 'em off real bad, I'mma show'em pourin up a duece and ridin' slab 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, I'mma break 'em 
 I'mma break 'em, I'mma break 'em off real bad 
 I'mma show'em pourin up a duece and ridin' slab 
 I'mma break 'em 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, I'mma break 'em 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, 
 I'mma break 'em, I'mma break 'em off real bad 
 I'mma show'em pourin up a duece and ridin' slab 
 (Paul Wall) 
 Now I gotta work ma wood grain wheel 
 Poppin' trunks, poppin' grillz, still poppin' seals 
 High up in the hill with ma mind on millz 
 Piece of chain swangin', bank roll, shiny grill 
 Baby, I got million dollar dreams, with ma mind on cream 
 I'm in that mean green machine clean on 19s 
 Flat screens in the headrest, swangin' like a swang set 
 Brandy wine, paint wet, comin' down tha's a fact 
 I'm in the 'lac chasin' broads like a lesbian 
 Full of that Kush flower, I'm breakin' off pedestrians 
 Higher than the street lights, floatin' like a parachute 
 Buzzin' like a bumblebee, mustard green Bentley coupe 
 Young gangsta, Mac game, sharper than a thumbtack 
 Breakin' 'em off, makin' all the boppers attract 
 Then they watch me, I'm rocked up fully loaded and slabbin' 
 Tryin' to hit it and quit it 
 Walk off like BIG Poppi then break 'em off 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, I'mma break 'em 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, 
 I'mma break 'em, I'mma break 'em off real bad 
 I'mma show'em pourin up a duece and ridin' slab 
 I'mma break 'em 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, I'mma break 'em 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, 
 I'mma break 'em, I'mma break 'em off real bad 
 I'mma show'em pourin up a duece and ridin' slab 
 (Lil' Keke) 
 Aye, aye 
 I pull up like this, untouchable white wrist 
 I'm hotter than warm piss, berry grape Sunkist 
 The truck gold mist five 50 slow buddy 
 Bentley continental with the mink floors dummy 
 Paul Wall money, dat's expensive taste 
 And 'em frilly ass fools we send 'em to myspace 
 I'mma break 'em off until the backbones broken 
 Stainless steel drop phantom, leave the top open 
 Shit done hit the fan, better cover your nose 
 And the Kush done start burnin', better cover your clothes (that's right) 
 Concrete crumblin', glass shootin' lazers 
 Crawlin' and cuttin' up on 24 razors 
 I'mma show 'em how to make the slab look phenomenal 
 Chasin' paper in the mornin', call me Houston Chronicle 
 Hold on then you buckle up the seat belt 
 Swisha House, Young Don, capital TF 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, I'mma break 'em 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, 
 I'mma break 'em, I'mma break 'em off real bad 
 I'mma show'em pourin up a duece and ridin' slab 
 I'mma break 'em 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, I'mma break 'em 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, 
 I'mma break 'em, I'mma break 'em off real bad 
 I'mma show'em pourin up a duece and ridin' slab 
 (Paul Wall) 
 Already 
 I'm higher than the satellite, crawlin' like a baby 
 Maneuverin' through the traffic like I'm Tracy McGrady 
 Still choppin' on 'em buttons, I'm struttin' and lookin' fresh 
 Switch hittin' like Berkman, this is ballin' at its best 
 In dat minute maid droppa', with retractable roof 
 Finer than wood, wavin' the hood, student loans on the two 
 The fifth wheel on the ground, and the trunk in the air 
 Paul Wall, baby I'm the definition of playa 
 Ma skillz is so ill when workin' the wood wheel 
 Tippin' 4s like a waiter, beware of the o'erseer 
 Wide screen mind frame, panoramic pimpin' 
 I'm sippin' on dat Osama, baby leanin' like I'm limpin' 
 In dat 2 seater feeder, it's me and a senorita 
 3 ounces up in the liter, and it's ten up in the heater 
 Mackin' a mamacita 
 Runnin' game like a cheetah 
 I'm knockin' 'em out the park 
 Similar to Derek Jeter (Break 'em off) 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, I'mma break 'em 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, 
 I'mma break 'em, I'mma break 'em off real bad 
 I'mma show'em pourin up a duece and ridin' slab 
 I'mma break 'em 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, I'mma break 'em 
 I'mma break 'em off real bad, 
 I'mma break 'em, I'mma break 'em off real bad 
 I'mma show'em pourin up a duece and ridin' slab
