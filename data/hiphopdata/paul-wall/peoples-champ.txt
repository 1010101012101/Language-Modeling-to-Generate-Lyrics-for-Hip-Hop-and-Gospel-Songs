I'm not the type that likes to think about the time I was broke 
 And reminiss how everybody thougt my rhyme was a joke 
 I played it fair while completitors were buying their votes 
 But that's life, I ain't cryin' I cope. 
 They talk about I owe them something 
 But they the ones holdin' me back 
 They the same people bringin' me down 
 That's why every time I hop up on the mic it ain't no holdin' me back 
 Watch I'll show y'all the meaning of clown until I'm under the grind 
 They gonna disrespect and slander my name it takes more than a strong mind to handle the fame 
 I walk a narrow path in this broad skandless game. 
 If you ain't got no unbrella don't stand in the rain 
 It gets deep, boyz losin they life cause of they rappin'
