I get up early and get it before the crack of dawn 
 And I'm still out when the sun set, gettin' my hustle on 
 I'm grindin' all day long to keep my paper long 
 I got my mind on paper chasin', my focus strong 
 Mind elevated, so my game upgraded 
 Now it's money in the pocket all day like Tom Brady 
 And even when the weather outside gets cold 
 I'ma stay on patrol to keep my bill fold swoll, baby 
 Even when it's cold outside, the sun got gutter 
 By the clouds in the sky, it stay hot like summer 
 I grind, I still grind, yeah 
 Even when the well runs dry, I see my struggle 
 Ain't a day goes by that I don't hustle 
 I grind, I still grind, yeah 
 The oven door's shut, but I still smell cake 
 The stench is too high, I ain't pumpin' my brakes 
 The paper is so large, it can change a man's faith 
 I'm with David Taylor every year changin' the plates 
 See I wake up extra early just to bleed these streets 
 From Gut bank to Debrees, tell 'em to gimme a piece 
 I got the bricks up on my tail tryin' to fall in love 
 But we just whip 'em and toss 'em up like a ticket stub 
 They say money can't buy me love and that's true 
 But money can buy me drugs so I'm cool 
 Ten dollars can buy the Clipse slugs for these tools 
 That'll cock and ready to let loose on these fools 
 Even when it's cold outside, the sun got gutter 
 By the clouds in the sky, it stay hot like summer 
 I grind, I still grind, yeah 
 Even when the well runs dry, I see my struggle 
 Ain't a day goes by that I don't hustle 
 I grind, I still grind, yeah 
 Gotta get this money baby, all day, all night 
 I'm breakin' this bread, I'm stackin' up this paper 
 Feel that, know what I'm talkin' about? 
 Ima go getta 
 My money makes money, my stocks are triplin' 
 So I'm movin' this paper like Dougie and Nicholas 
 Addicted to the hustle so the bread comin' fast 
 I'm connected all across the state like Comcast 
 I'm bleedin' I-ten like a gunshot wound 
 So I can knock off new beamer, that's gon' come out next June 
 I ain't slept in 'bout a week so I'm high as the moon 
 I'm tryin' to make sure my money pile up like sand dune 
 Even when it's cold outside, the sun got gutter 
 By the clouds in the sky, it stay hot like summer 
 I grind, I still grind, yeah 
 Even when the well runs dry, I see my struggle 
 Ain't a day goes by that I don't hustle 
 I grind, I still grind, yeah 
 Man I'm holdin' on, man I'm holdin' on 
 I'm gon' do it, I'm gon' win 
 Man I'm holdin' on, man I'm holdin' on 
 I'm gon' do it, I'm gon' win again 
 Even when it's cold outside, the sun got gutter 
 By the clouds in the sky, it stay hot like summer 
 I grind, I still grind, yeah 
 Even when the well runs dry, I see my struggle 
 Ain't a day goes by that I don't hustle 
 I grind, I still grind, yeah
