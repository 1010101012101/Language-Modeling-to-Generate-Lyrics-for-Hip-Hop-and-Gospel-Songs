Sip sippin tha barre 
 Grippin tha grain 
 I got 17 karrots in my piece and chains [repeat 4x] 
 Y'all open a map and take a trip down south 
 Come on over to huston, Texas welcome to the swisha house 
 It's the ? of the trill 
 Coming straight out the block 
 I got my mind on my hustle 
 I'm tyrna make it to the top 
 So I put in work and stack at night 
 Determination is all I got 
 On the grind I sceme and plot 
 Whatever it takes to raise my stock 
 I'm breaking bread out here try to survive 
 I'm under water with these sharks prayin' I stay alive 
 I'm putting up numbers like Garnett on that 610 south 
 Ain't nothing soft about my block 'cept the packs of the south 
 This here that people's champ talk 
 This the expressions of a g 
 And ima be chasin after them g's until I R.I.P. 
 Its paul wall baby 
 What it do be bangin' screws since '92 
 Pat pat, lil kee kee, funky hawk and the rest of the crew 
 So whos next on that plex 
 I'm flippin slab and weavin hood 
 Wit screens hanging down from the roof I'm ballin like a real playa should I'm 
 They got you thinking huston, Texas the home of david carr 
 But really its candy paint playas sippin on barre 
 Take a ride wit a star straight outta that low star state 
 Lil michael watched the train and told me I gotta hold my weight 
 Motovation is the key when you moving them keys 
 Entropenuaters out the game outta 
 The 713 
 See one of the keys to my success 
 I switched up like rick maddox 
 While maintaining my composings to become one of the baddest 
 I stick to the g code in my el g'est clothes 
 While I'm tippin on 4 4 's with these scuicide doors 
 I buy dro and pro pow for my dogs that died in the past 
 Prayin' to god I stay flow just to make this hustle last 
 Its prime time I'm obeying the laws 
 While my life is on trial 
 I'm tyrn knockout pieces chain and throw some ice on my smile 
 It's all working ok while I'm out here punching in clock 
 Its hustlemania out here grinding on the block I'm tryna ball baby 
 You see the dirty coast trenches where the killers don't think 
 Where them boys be slugged up and tatted up with that ink 
 These lil cowards tryna sas and make the character of a g 
 But I'm squashing all of that chatter keeping it real and being me 
 Its g's up and marks down when I'm making my round 
 While I'm up in nyc with dipset we shutting it down 
 Shouts out to keenan martin holding it down in the low coast 
 While I'm on the block grinin tryna hold my post 
 I'm glass house on the grill my necklace glow like toxic waste 
 I'm iced out like frozen food 
 Sippin on the ski taste 
 I'm moving time on my grind 
 It ain't no time for playing games 
 That's why I hustle 25/8 acumulating 
 This change 
 I got them diamonds up against that wood grippin grain and sippin good 
 Bustin' time that's my hood gettin' money is understood 
 I'm on the hustle baby all night and all day 
 100 d up in my safe 
 Safe to say that boy is paid
