 That's what it is... yeah. 
 Love at first sight. 
 Young Dun, P Wall. 
 It is what it is. 
 Hey, check it, check it, hey. 
 She had big bubble eyes and skin like peanut butter, even though I hear boys talk I stil love her. First time we met was like a dream come true, 'cause these niggaz on tha streets ain't seen nothin' like u. It was a red-head sunshine fresh from California, boys went 2 trippin' when I put tha candy on ya, still got ya back, got tha iron, its whatever, jackers stay hatin', they can't stand we together. Baby wanna creep even though I'm fo' deep, 'cause she shine like Lil' money whenever we hit tha heat. Done had plenty women but ur still my wife, from tha 80's through tha 90's been tha love of my life. Now ur hip swangin', wide body bangin', ur parkin lot pimpin' when we at tha club hangin', strip was on fie they was lovin' ya mayne, and every time I c her its just a beautiful thing... yeah 
 U look (u look) so fly (so fly) 
 I luv tha way you feel inside 
 Its just somethin' about tha way you move 
 All eyes on me whenever I'm wit u

 Yeah my woman got a grill but she's o so classy, when she's strutin' down tha block she looks o so sassy. She looks good in them high heels, them 24's look fly. She likes 2 shine in neon lights when she b wavin' goodbye. Whenever I... turn her on and start warmin' her up, I take my time and move slow, until she's ready 2 cut, and sometimes I run her hot, so I just take her back home and put her up for awile and give her some time on her own. I like my girls a little thick, that big body is great, I must admit that I'm in luv wit that wide ol shape, and yeah she's high mantaince, every week goin' out shop, either gettin' somethin' waxed or just fixin' her locks. I'm ridin' wit her actin' bad, makin' everybody jelous, she gets mad at me when I b hangin' out wit tha fellas. I hear these new schoolers hatin', but they just don't understand, them foreign chicks can't do it like my old school can... man 
 U look (u look) so fly (so fly)

 I like 2 keep my girl lookin' clean, look how she shine when we floss, ain't she really clean. She like nice shit so she keep my spendin' green, from tha front 2 tha back, she's a mean machine, she like 2 make alot of noise when she b on tha block, sometimes tha neighbors get mad and they call tha cops, I don't trust boys 'cause they might try and snatch ya, my baby momma got jelous and she tried 2 scratch ya. She got my on her back, it reads "Archie's Bitch" and I'll hurt ya if ya try and take Archie's shit. I still remember when you had 2 have that operation, u came out with six TV's and a playstation. I might let a nigga ride but don't slam my door, and I'ma put you out if you put them ashes on my floor. I think we look so fly when we ride together, I swear 2 God; I wish that we could ride forever (ride forever) 
 U look (u look) so fly (so fly)
