I chunk up the deuce for the South and the North 
 Boys talkin' down and boys wanna hate 
 I chunk up the deuce for the South and the North 
 Boys talkin' down don't make me pull out the choppa 
 I chunk up the deuce for the South and the North 
 Boys talkin' down I'll leave 'em on the streets dead 
 I chunk up the deuce for the South and the North 
 Boys talkin' down I got them diamonds in my mouth 
 Well it's that grain grippa from Houston, Tex 
 That bar sippa, that bar no plex 
 I'm straight up outta that Swishahouse 
 Where G. Dash write all the checks 
 So check the neck, check the wrist 
 I'm balla status from head to toe 
 My jewelry shop sell more grills 
 Than George Foreman, baby now ya know 
 That ain't a igloo, that's my watch 
 And that ain't snow, baby that's my chain 
 That's not an ice tray, that's my teeth 
 And that's not a snowcone, that's my ring 
 That ain't cool-Aid up in my cup 
 I stay sippin that purple oil 
 I stay flippin the slab on 4's 
 'Cause I'm a hustla till I'm in the soil 
 My wrist game is one of a kind 
 Patek Philippe worth 100K 
 My work schedule out on the block 
 It's mash all night and grind all day 
 No 401K for a hustler 
 Just bleed the block and stack that paper 
 M.O.B. when it come to hoes 
 And a 40 cal when it come to haters 
 We authentic players not counterfeit 
 Got a 600 Benz with a fall kit 
 Got hoes at the HK turnin' tricks 
 Out runnin' the tracks tryina make me rich 
 I'm too legit to quit 
 Stackin up that paper till I'm gone 
 So I'ma be workin wood wheel and catchin splinters 
 Ridin' 20 inches or better of chrome 
 I chunk up the deuce for the South and the North 
 Boys talkin' down and boys wanna hate 
 I chunk up the deuce for the South and the North 
 Boys talkin' down don't make me pull out the choppa 
 I chunk up the deuce for the South and the North 
 Boys talkin' down I'll leave 'em on the streets dead 
 I chunk up the deuce for the South and the North 
 Boys talkin' down I got them diamonds in my mouth 
 (Don Ke!) 
 Houston Tex got the streets burnin 
 Poppin' seals with them 4's turnin' 
 Rookie boys they still learnin 
 Losin' cash, I'm still earnin 
 Get my bread while I shake the fed 
 Keep them dimes in and out my bed 
 Jump in the drop to convert the top 
 And let 'em bop on candy red 
 Leather seats with that wood out 
 They don't know what my hood 'bout 
 Tryin' to take the young Don's spot 
 I'm platinum ball and still hot 
 Haters off in my mix again 
 Pimpin' broads plus pimpin' pens 
 Multiplyin, I gotta win 
 Keep that ice lookin' clear as gin 
 Out tha roof still chunkin deuce 
 Ridin' slab and hoppin juice 
 Diamond grill with plenty skills 
 Just pass the mic and I'll let it loose 
 Independent, still chasin bucks 
 22's on Porshe trucks 
 Model chicks with them big ol' butts 
 Killa clans with them big ol' nuts 
 Hit the club with my game tight 
 Hoe's boppin my fame right 
 Did her thang the same night 
 Boys talkin' it's all hype 
 Cut the check when I run my mouth 
 Rollin' green like I'm playing golf 
 Texas boys be goin' off 
 Representin' that North and South 
 I chunk up the deuce for the South and the North 
 Boys talkin' down and boys wanna hate 
 I chunk up the deuce for the South and the North 
 Boys talkin' down don't make me pull out the choppa 
 I chunk up the deuce for the South and the North 
 Boys talkin' down I'll leave 'em on the streets dead
