(Chorus/intro: paul wall) 
 I'm a ride foir my partna I'll die for my dawg 
 If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all 
 I'm a watch my boy back and stay down till the end 
 And if you don't feel the same then you not my friend 
 I'm a ride foir my partna I'll die for my dawg 
 If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all 
 I'm a watch my boy back and stay down till the end 
 And if you don't feel the same then you not my friend 
 Man I ain't got no friends motherfuck all y'all 
 But when the shit goes down I'm the one y'all call 
 Like I ain't good enough to kick it 
 But I'm good enough to crick it 
 Tell the truth y'all ain't ready ya I'm the one whos really with it 
 For the ones who really down there's nothing but love 
 But for you fakers and haters man there's nothing but slugs 
 Catch your fame get to busting that's the end of discussion 
 You need to quit with all that tough talk huffin and puffin 
 Fuck puffing we could do it we could go from the shoulders 
 And when you get stomped out I bet you run with the rollers 
 Game goofy as a groupie need to stay in your lane 
 And slow your motherfucking roller don't be saying my name 
 Bitch! 
 (Chorus: paul wall) 
 I'm a ride foir my partna I'll die for my dawg 
 If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all 
 I'm a watch my boy back and stay down till the end 
 And if you don't feel the same then you not my friend 
 I'm a ride foir my partna I'll die for my dawg 
 If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all 
 I'm a watch my boy back and stay down till the end 
 And if you don't feel the same then you not my friend 
 (Verse 2: paul wall) 
 Say I'm a stay ten toes down on the dirt 
 And I'm a ride for my partnas till I get murked 
 Everybody says they love you when you on a shirt 
 But no one hold you down when your pockets hurt 
 I'll stay down for my homies like a friend should 
 Fuck around boy I wish a motherfucker would 
 You come around when you hear a playa paper good 
 Or catch ghost when drama jumps off in the hood 
 I roll doug raw down for whooping penny ass 
 Pull out the strap and load till you in the grass 
 All these so called friends ain't really down 
 When the shit pop off they the first to lay you down 
 (Chorus: paul wall) 
 I'm a ride foir my partna I'll die for my dawg 
 If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all 
 I'm a watch my boy back and stay down till the end 
 And if you don't feel the same then you not my friend 
 I'm a ride foir my partna I'll die for my dawg 
 If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all 
 I'm a watch my boy back and stay down till the end 
 And if you don't feel the same then you not my friend 
 (Verse 3: slim thug) 
 I'm a ride for my niggas I die for my niggas 
 Go to war and I let them slugs fly for my niggas 
 Ain't many real niggas you could trust 
 'Cause when shit go down? too many niggas ready to bust 
 Everybody say they friends when shit all good 
 How many will be down if you still in the hood 
 How many got your back like a real friend should 
 If the day you go broke they'll? you some of that good 
 You better wise up and open your eyes up 
 'Cause if you know like me they all disguised up 
 That's why I ride solo even in the photo 
 I ride with my fo fo smoking on that do do 
 (Chorus: paul wall) 
 I'm a ride foir my partna I'll die for my dawg 
 If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all 
 I'm a watch my boy back and stay down till the end 
 And if you don't feel the same then you not my friend 
 I'm a ride foir my partna I'll die for my dawg 
 If you got a problem with it motherfuck all y'all 
 I'm a watch my boy back and stay down till the end 
 And if you don't feel the same then you not my friend
