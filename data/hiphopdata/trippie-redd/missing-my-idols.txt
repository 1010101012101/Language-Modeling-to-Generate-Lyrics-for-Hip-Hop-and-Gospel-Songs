Take a vivid picture, no photo 
 Implement that shit into your mind, just so you know though 
 Sucka free living, I'ma say that that's the motto 
 So for any nigga on that sucka shit, I'm no hoe bro 
 Might just have to drop a bomb, Han Solo 
 Got me bicken back being bool, Quasimodo 
 All about my paper gotta get my fucking dough hoe 
 Always on the fucking go-go, you a bitch like Tony Romo 
 Niggas came around now they extinct like Dodo's 
 Meanwhile I'm in New York fucking up SoHo 
 Just bagged a new chick, Caroline, nickname Coco 
 Took her to the tele now lil' baby going loco 
 She just give me face, ain't no fucking that's a no-no 
 And she going 30 early dirty no soap though 
 I laugh at the haters, everything they say a joke though 
 And I'm screaming fuck 12, all these fowl ass po-po 
 Nowadays I really miss my fucking idols, so that's the title 
 I grab a bible, pray for my rivals 
 Dead on arrival, I swear this shit to me like a cycle 
 Bodies in piles, blood rivers resemble Niles 
 They need survival, they need to rehearse a recital 
 I just sit back and listen to old Wayne songs 
 And get dome from a bitch while I brainstorm 
 And spit flames while also making it rain storm 
 See I can't ignore it 
 And you niggas don't see it's in your brain you're snoring 
 And you sleep on me until you can't no more 
 And don't fake on me and try to play the boy 
 I don't know why I feel like nobody loves me 
 Or why they feel like my intention's something ugly 
 Or why I feel like everyone needs something from me 
 Or why I feel like everyone just saying fuck me 
 Or why I feel like the opposition gon' buss me 
 If I gave you my heart would you still love me 
 Lately baby I feel like nobody trust me 
 Is it just me, yeah 
 Nowadays I really miss my fucking idols, so that's the title 
 I grab a bible, pray for my rivals 
 Dead on arrival, I swear this shit to me like a cycle 
 Bodies in piles, blood rivers resemble Niles 
 They need survival, they need to rehearse a recital 
 I just sit back and listen to old Wayne songs 
 And get dome from a bitch while I brainstorm 
 And spit flames while also making it rain storm
