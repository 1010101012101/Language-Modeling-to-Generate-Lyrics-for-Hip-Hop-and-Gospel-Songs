I can't do this anymore, trying not to be ignored 
 Put my pedal to the floor, I spread my wings I let them soar 
 Let them soar-oar, let them soar 
 I can't do this anymore, yeah 
 When it rains it really pours, yeah 
 Like an eagle Imma soar, yeah 
 Desert eagle let it roar, yeah 
 Let it bang-bang, let it bang-bang 
 Let it rang-sang, let it bang-gang 
 Baby yes you're mine, baby yes you're fine

 New Chanel walkers, when I walked up in the room 
 Maison Margiela, when I walked up in the room 
 Bunch of dull smokers, when I walked up in the room 
 Iced out motorola, when I walked up in the room 
 Woadie with my chopper, talking down and boy you're doomed 
 Used to want a 'rari, now I'm rich I bought a coupe 
 Now I'm switching lanes and I never keep a roof 
 You going out sad, all they do is laugh at you 
 Now I gotta get it for my momma and my sisters 
 And my nephews and my nieces love'em all 
 Hope you niggas really ready for the fall 
 When it all comes down, who can you call?
