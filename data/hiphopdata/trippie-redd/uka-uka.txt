Yeah, Big 14 know what the fuck goin' on, yeah 
 Ooh, said I made y'all 
 So how could I be mad that I ain't y'all? 
 Same reason why I hate y'all 
 Hop up in this Rari then I race off, ay 
 Do the dash in this racecar 
 Got the Pistol Pete on me, is this a face off? Ay 
 Better say your damn grace dog 
 Blind in reality just like you're Ray Charles 
 Ay, I don't want no more pressure 
 No, I don't want no more pressure 
 No, I don't want no more pressure 
 Ah, don't want no more pressure 
 Ah, don't want no more pressure 
 Ah, don't want no more pressure, ah 
 Ay, fuck your bitch and hit my fucking dab 
 Ay, choppers by my side, you know it clap 
 Like your bitch ass, big bag 
 Big cash, and I tote a big gat 
 Aftermath, I'm just dressed in all black 
 Got the black mask 
 I'll pull it out the motherfucking black bag 
 Ooh, yeah, and drop your ass 
 Bang bang, lil nigga you left in the past 
 Ooh, ay, son these niggas, I'm your dad 
 Big racks on my body, baby got this cash 
 Pray these goofy niggas really goin' out sad 
 Give these pussy niggas hell like I'm Johnny Gat, ooh 
 Swear I want no pressure 
 No, swear I want no pressure 
 No, swear I want no pressure 
 No, swear I want no pressure 
 No, swear I want no pressure 
 No, swear I want no pressure 
 No, swear I want no pressure 
 Ooh, ay, ooh, are you niggas really from the field? 
 Or are you niggas really from the hills? 
 I got a mob of niggas coming by the mills 
 They'll shoot your ass down boy from 1400 kills, for real 
 I'm tryna find your fuckin' chill 
 I'm off this Actavis, I'm tryna pop a seal 
 I don't do Xannies baby, no, don't do no pills 
 I'm just smokin' on dope, baby 
 Just thumbin' through the mills, so ill
