Haven't smiled in awhile 
 But yesterday was too wild 
 I guess I wanna know how you feel, yeah 
 How you feel, yeah 
 If you wouldn't be so proud 
 All my thoughts are so proud 
 I guess I wanna know how you feel, yeah 
 How you feel, yeah 
 I'm tryna pour my heart out 
 How the fuck I'm 'posed to sound? 
 I guess I'm tryna know how you feel 
 Like cookies to a girl scout 
 And nobody would move or smile 
 I guess I'm tryna know how you feel 
 How you feel 
 How you feel about me, feel 
 How you feel about me, feel 
 How you feel about me, feel 
 How you feel about me 
 How you feel, how you feel, how you feel 
 Ooh (how you feel about me, how you feel) 
 Ooh (how you feel about me, how you feel) 
 Ooh-whoa (how you feel about, how you feel, how you feel, how you feel) 
 Feelin', how you feelin' (how you feel about me, how you feel) 
 How you feelin' (how you feel about me, how you feel) 
 How you feelin' (how you feel about me, how you feel) 
 How you feelin' (how you feel about me, how you feel, feel, feel) 
 How you feelin', how you feelin', how you feelin'-in' 
 Ooh (how you feel about me, how you feel) 
 Ooh (how you feel about me, how you feel) 
 Ooh-ooh (how you feel about me, how you feel, how you feel about me, how you feel)
