It's 3 in the morning 
 I'm awaken by the sound of the doorbell 
 Thoughts going through my mind 
 Pitch black, my eyes are blind 
 So I'm getting up to see what's happening 
 I'm hearing voices so I'm creeping slowly 
 Just in case they gets to capping 
 I walk asleep to the door 
 Next thing I know these fools jumping out of my bushes 
 And got me face down on the floor 
 Now I'm getting hit, kicked, and pistoled with 
 And the only thing that I see was all this blood flying in my spit 
 Oh my God they're trying to kill the T 
 And worst then that all these G's were smoked down on PCP 
 They threw me in my bathtub where I lie in blood 
 These homies must be thinking I live the life of a thug 
 They full of hate 
 Beating me with pipes and weights 
 And I'm looking for a way out but it seems that there's no escape 
 Dear God, I'm wondering can you save me 
 But maybe I should die because this world got me going crazy 
 Now what am I to do 
 I'm sad and confused 
 I'm thinking about my family, friends, and my baby boo, too 
 Gee, tears run down my eyes as I start to cry 
 I'm wondering to my self why do the good always have to die 
 Tomorrows not promised to me or to you 
 Awhoo 
 Death is knocking at your door what you gonna do 
 Awhoo 
 Man they finna kill me 
 They tripping and pulling me out of my bathtub 
 Dragging me through my house 
 Hollering 'cause I'm getting shocked in my mouth 
 They stealing my possessions 
 Gapping everything I own 
 Took my VCR and got away with 4,000 bones 
 I'm outside 
 They got me at gunpoint 
 Trying to jack my ride 
 And if I try to run God knows it would only be suicide 
 So I better stay 
 But they still gonna try to pull my car 
 So I better think fast 'cause if I don't blast 
 I can't let down my guard 
 I'm praying to God someone would call one time, 
 Bu nobody called one time 
 So I'm stuck in the midst of this crime 
 He's cursing at me 
 Asking me what my combination be 
 And if I don't tell him homie you know better 
 This be killing 
 So I told him 
 Lock numer 8 3 11 
 It's the 2 11 
 But I don't want to end up in the 1 8 7 
 I'm 21 but will I live to see 22 
 And witness the birth of the organized Rhyme Crew 
 Oh no 
 Here comes they homies in a van 
 Rolling 12 deep 
 And I'm thinking to myself how much longer will I be getting beat 
 The man behind me shouts out that's it I'm killing him 
 That's when I finally came to my senses and said I'm stealing then 
 I socked the man in his grill then I watched him drop 
 To the pavement 
 I had to run or I knew that I'd be gettin' popped 
 So now they on a chase hunt to try and capture me 
 Hoping to leave me dead like a menace to society 
 Now I finally realizing and that its true when God says 
 "Tomorrow's not promised to you"
