 Psycho, west coast, rider, music 
 T-Bone: 
 For you've got dogs to cruise with 
 Who this rapper tryin to step to me 
 Talkin bout you ain't really bout that ministry 
 Child please, we's them G's on them knees 
 Preachin from California to the Florida Keys, we be 
 Slangin the WORD, while they smokin they're herb 
 And dippin 64's, hittin switches on the curb 
 Then swerve back in place, bump that bass 
 Wit that sanctified sound produced by that playa Chase 
 Like Mase, I'm fittin, makin ya feel so good' 
 When I bump this gospel music in your hood, Inglewood 
 West Covina, Pasadena, then take it to my gente, in Puente 
 I can't forget about all my patnas in the 415, 510, 916 
 Make them chips, we stick together like cement and bricks 
 Now just bounce to this playalisctic Boneybone hit 
 Dip bounce, side to side 
 And come ride wit a play from that killa Cali west side 
 Psycho, west coast, rider, music 
 For you and all your dawgs to cruise with 
 Dip bounce, side to side 
 And come ride wit a play from that killa Cali west side 
 Psycho, west coast, rider, music 
 For you and all your dawgs to cruise with 
 T-Bone: 
 Shh, ain't not talkin, while I'm puttin demons in coffins 
 Dippin in the Cadillac bumpin Dawkins and Dawkins 
 Got me wrapped up, tied up 
 If you love Cali, playa throw the West side up 
 Now watch me ride like them hell's angels 
 In them Harleys, or them cowboys wit the blue wranglers 
 Swingin ther lasso, screamin wild wild west 
 'Cause where I'm from, you need a bullet proof vest 
 Smoke the what for your stress 
 Nah dawg, hold up, wait a minute 
 'Cause ain't no high unless the Holy Ghost ain't rolled up in it 
 I get drunk in the spirit on a day to day basis 
 And preach the WORD, to my patnas catchin cases 
 Racist clicks too, piru flamed up in blue 
 Crips too, God wanna bless you 
 2, 3, 4 and 5, now close your eyes 
 And bump this in your ride while you glide and... 
 Dip bounce, side to side 
 And come ride wit a play from that killa Cali west side 
 Psycho, west coast, rider, music 
 For you and all your dawgs to cruise with 
 Dip bounce, side to side 
 And come ride wit a play from that killa Cali west side 
 Psycho, west coast, rider, music 
 For you and all your dawgs to cruise with 
 T-Bone: 
 I just can't stop, makin suacy gospel hip hop 
 Fittin do this, til the day that I drop 
 Like Tupac, 'who do you believe in' 
 I put my faith in God, blessed to be breathin 
 Preachin to the heathen, buckin them demons 
 Oh what a feelin, got the crowd screamin 
 Dancin on the ceilin 
 So hate if you wanna man, say what you say 
 But gospel rap wit Bone is like LA wit out a Dr. Dre 
 Or Sway without Tech, catchin wreck 
 Or these California's streets without a ghetto vet 
 It ain't happenin, Bibles I'm still packin them 
 And jackin demons wit them 44 magnums 
 Dip bounce, side to side 
 And come ride wit a play from that killa Cali west side 
 Psycho, west coast, rider, music 
 For you and all your dawgs to cruise with 
 Dip bounce, side to side 
 And come ride wit a play from that killa Cali west side 
 Psycho, west coast, rider, music 
 For you and all your dawgs to cruise with 
 Dip bounce, side to side 
 And come ride wit a play from that killa Cali west side 
 Psycho, west coast, rider, music 
 For you and all your dawgs to cruise with 
 Dip bounce, side to side 
 And come ride wit a play from that killa Cali west side 
 Psycho, west coast, rider, music
