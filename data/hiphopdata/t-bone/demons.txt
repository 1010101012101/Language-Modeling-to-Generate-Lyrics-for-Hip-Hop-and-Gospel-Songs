Yo what's up homies if you don't want to have demons in you life you 
 Better ask Jesus to save you and to come into your heart. those demons 
 Will come out of you if you say the word Jesus. Satan is out there y'all 
 He is tempting us out there he want us to be on drugs he is keeping 
 Us from the grace of god
