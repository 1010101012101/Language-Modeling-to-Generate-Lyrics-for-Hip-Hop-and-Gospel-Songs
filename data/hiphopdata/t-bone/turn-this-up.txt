Turn this up in your truck, or your jeep wi' the beat, 
 If ya know I got heat then, bump it bump it 
 Cadillacs better dump it dump it 
 Yeah, everybody better turn this up 
 All my thugs wit the chucks in tha clubs, 
 Wit that ladies and tha broads, 
 Just bump it, bump it 
 DJ's better dump it dump it 
 Come on, let's just turn this up 
 For all the homies in tha hood that be dienin' 
 For something they can believe in 
 Ain't not reason not to play it loud, 
 Crank it patna, make my ghetto people scream and shout, 
 Play it loud while I grab this mic and show everybody how we be doing 
 It when we chilling on on tha Westside, when we cruisin' 
 We turn the volume up sky high 
 Bump tha bass so you can feel the vibe, 
 Now let me show you how we do it in the SCA 
 Where the bloods and the crips play wit' AKs and ESES, from LA 
 Get tattoos of gangs and tha 13, 
 Come on 
 Crank this jam in ya E-Class, wit' tha 20 inch rims 
 And the wood grain dash, white leather wit the DVD, 
 TV's play it loud in ya SUV. 
 Come on 
 Turn this up in your truck or your jeep wit the beat 
 If you know I got heat then, bump it bump it 
 Cadillacs better dump it dump it 
 Yeah, everybody better turn this up 
 All my thugs wit the chucks in the da clubs 
 Wit tha ladies and the broads 
 Just bump it bump it 
 DJ's better dump it dump it 
 Come on, let's just turn this up 
 Dump this bass in ya 20 inch Pioneer speakers 
 For ya rogues and tha chicas, Boriquas and tha Nicas, 
 Tha Indians, Cherokees and the Incas, 
 Turn this up in the hood or your barrio, 
 The buro, or ya car yo, Chevy Monte Carlo, 
 Or ya Lamborghini Diablo, 
 Come on 
 Nod yo head, roll tha top down, 
 Let the world know how us West Ridas get down 
 From Inglewood to tha CPT, 
 Oaktown, Friscos to tha NYC. 
 Come on 
 Turn this up in your truck or your jeep wit the beat 
 If you know I got heat then, bump it bump it 
 Cadillacs better dump it dump it 
 Everybody better turn this up 
 All my thugs wit the chucks in the da clubs 
 Wit tha ladies and the broads 
 Just bump it bump it 
 DJ's better dump it dump it 
 Come on, let's just 
 Turn this up in the middle of the rush hour traffic, 
 Or the projects where the thugs get drastic, 
 Blast it, in the clubs where the broads be dancing, 
 Come on 
 Turn this up in your Chevy Nova, 
 Escalade, Porsche, or ya RangeRover, 
 Navigator, Bentley, or ya Toyota, 
 Or the Pinto on blocks wit' the broke down motor. 
 Turn this up put the windows down, 
 Let tha world hear this BoneyBone Corleone sound, 
 When I'm flippin', kickin', throwin' out tha wicked 
 And spittin', lyrical styles that got ya buggin' out trippin'. 
 Turn this up in your truck or your jeep wit the beat 
 If you know I got heat then, bump it bump it 
 Cadillacs better dump it dump it 
 Everybody better turn this up 
 All my thugs wit the chucks in the da clubs 
 Wit tha ladies and the broads 
 Just bump it bump it

 Turn this up in your truck or your jeep wit the beat 
 If you know I got heat then, bump it bump it 
 Cadillacs better dump it dump it

 All my thugs wit the chucks in the da clubs 
 Wit tha ladies and the broads 
 Just bump it bump it 
 DJ's better dump it dump it 
 Spoken: 
 Heh, heh, 
 Check this out, man 
 When you're on and you ride down the freeway 
 You better dump this, you know what I'm saying? 
 When you're sitting at the easy 
 Go ahead dump this space on the home stereo 
 No matter where you went 
 East coast, west coast 
 Europe, Spain, Jamaica 
 It don't matter, baby 
 You know what I'm saying 
 Make noise 
 Get the neighbors mad 
 We're going to crank this up for the year 2001 and beyond 
 Baby, you all know how we do this 
 Flick a bone, you ought to know 
 Make noise for life, baby 
 Crank this up
