I'm sweet like cinnamon, when I'm spittin' this lyrical venom 
 Givin' rappers the blues like denim when I'm killin' 'em 
 Fillin' them with these syllables, synonyms of adrenaline 
 Spillin' off a spiritual tongue then numbing them like penicillin 
 Plus I'm trying to reach their lives like Gilligan 
 God willin', the spiritual healin' no, stop the drug dealin' and killin' 
 Because I'm feelin' like I'm ready to lose my mind 
 So many bullets be flying and riders be dying 
 Gotta make a difference, for instance the inmates in prison make bad decisions 
 For lack of wisdom, so I cut 'em open and make incisions 
 Fill 'em with spiritualism, tell 'em 'bout the one that's arisen 
 How they can be free in their spirits and have their sins forgiven 
 By the one that died on the cross, 'cause even while they were into all their drinkin' and smokin' he loved them even when they were lost 
 So listen to me and stop dissin' the G 
 'Cause I got the remedy dawg on how y'all can be free, c'mon ... 
 Blazing microphones 
 Bringing nothing but that heat from the west coast 
 Chase beats, Bone lyrics like Vito Corleone 
 We be running things so act like you all know 
 Boneyard can't be stopped now 
 Yeah, I'm not a Jehovah's Witness, but I witness for Jehovah 
 Back in the days, the first to slang 'caine in the baking soda 
 But now-a-days I'm like preaching the word 
 Like a drug dealer slangin' holy rock on the curb 
 Eyes blurred off the holy ghost contact smoke 
 Got you trippin' off my rims, crushed ice, and my rope 
 Plus I'm gift with flows and wrist is frozen 
 I thought you all knew dawg (WHAT?) I'm God's Chosen 
 Highly favored standin' with the elite 
 That stand-apart-dawg, anointed to bring the Word to the streets 
 Hanging and entertaining the famous, set you claim the game of naming 
 Unless I'm naming I'm naming Jesus on the throne and reigning 
 Paintin' a picture for G's banging of how the Lord can save them 
 Train 'em like a Baltimore Raven engravin' the name of Jesus across their heart 'cause it's breakin' 
 For Satan is hatin', anticipatin' and hatin', and once they're trapped there's no escapin' 
 Blazing microphones 
 Bringing nothing but that heat from the west coast 
 Chase beats, Bone lyrics like Vito Corleone 
 We be running things so act like you all know 
 Boneyard can't be stopped now 
 I've been doin' this for 12 years, it ain't easy y'all 
 To make hit records that are off the heezy y'all 
 Especially when them busters sippin' on that haterade 
 Talkin' behind your back and try to stop you on a day to day 
 I don't make music for them playa haters anyways 
 This is for them killas and thugs sippin' on that Alizé 
 Runaways and esés locked down in prison 
 (WHY THEM?) They ones in need of a physician 
 And I know the perfect doctor y'all 
 That can heal you when you answer to the altar call 
 He can fill all the emptiness and void in your heart 
 That's why I rhyme out of a need and not for love of the art 
 So listen, my only mission is soul fishin' 
 So that when the rapture happens, faces will be on the back of milk cartons missin' 
 Blazing microphones 
 Bringing nothing but that heat from the west coast 
 Chase beats, Bone lyrics like Vito Corleone 
 We be running things so act like you all know 
 Boneyard can't be stopped now 
 (Repeat)
