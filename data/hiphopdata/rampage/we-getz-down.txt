[Rampage] (702) 
 Yeah come on, come on, check it out

 (Roll) 
 Yeah come on, everything 
 (Rolllllllllllllllll) 
 Flipmode, violator 
 (I like...) 
 Check this out 
 (Say roll, dig the... you roll) 
 Verse one: rampage 
 I went into the mirage, parties on charge 
 10 bottles of dom p, I'm feelin' so large 
 Chickens shakin' they asses like ya don't care 
 Guess what (what?) 
 This is the party of the year, flooded out cartier 
 Tell 'em stop and stare 
 Rocks in my ear 
 Weighing two point eight, so I'm livin' life straight 
 Fuck all you player haters, I got them now-and-later gators 
 The mad future flavors 
 Niggas pass 'em like a pack of life savors 
 My whole cup is lime green, flipmode is on the scene 
 Call me the black charlie sheen 
 The rap itty ammine 
 That makes you wanna scream, throw ya hands in the air 
 If you know what I mean, I countin' one (one!) 
 Like a basketball team 
 Makin' sure that you shake your ass 
 Till you fall out on the ground, you better bring you oxygen tank 
 We gettin' down 
 I wonder why... 
 We're getting so much paper 
 I wonder why... 
 And that I've never, that I've never feel 
 (Never feel like that) 
 I wonder why (why) 
 We're getting so much paper 
 I wonder why (why, why, why, why, why, why) 
 Verse two: rampage 
 Gramp I'm a big willie, from new york to philly 
 I take you to the streets like billy 
 Shady niggaz actin' silly 
 They watch my back, I still got my shit millie 
 I'm a cool cat, that says to myself 
 No fakin' jacks 
 My accountant pays my tax when I shop at sax 
 Just bought a gold acs, that's fully loaded 
 Now I'm bloated, you know my name in this rap game 
 I'm doing many things I can't explain 
 Buying it in twenty's 
 Back with a hundred tellin' them to keep the change 
 Take a long trip to Spain, I got a phat house in the ill (hill) 
 Sippin' marguritas like shaquielle 
 Bout to see three mill' 
 And build and empire, yo, yo, yo the ramp is on fire 
 I won't stop rocking until I retire, flipmode toughest squad 
 And we still on fire, we getz down 
 Chorus (sung by 702) 
 I wonder why... 
 We're getting so much paper 
 I wonder why... 
 And that I've never, that I've never feel 
 (Never feel like that) 
 I wonder why (why) 
 We're getting so much paper 
 I wonder why (why, why, why, why, why, why)
