Rock on, Rock on, Rock on... 
 I got chicks in my livin' room shakin they Asses 
 Flip Mode get ya high smokin' grass 
 Yo it's all about fun sex 'n' drugs 
 Makin' more money than all ya rap thugs 
 I'm seenin broads and blunts passed around 
 Rampage is the nigga from underground 
 Sweet potato 
 Kid crusader 
 I want a shorty like Jada 
 Tits are off like a mile later 
 So we can get buck wild 
 That's my style 
 I'm in a mansion in Strong Isle 
 Drinkin' Don P and Crystal 
 Yo that's the spoke file 
 I'm livin' like Adino Brown 
 Bow down I'm the talk of the town 
 This is the low down 
 My show down, you can bet all your chips 
 I'm a take you around the world run up in ya girl 
 Ramps in, call me Earl, uh 
 Niggas everywhere, DJ's everywhere rockin' to Ramps new beat 
 When I hear his music I can't help but get down like they do 
 Upside down I'm a turn it out bust it out 
 I'm the one you talkin' about 
 Hitin Hennessee with my peeps from Tennessee 
 Givin' you a head rush straight to your dome 
 I'm in the zone 
 Plus I'm sitin on chrome 
 You jealous What? Take your black ass home 
 Yo spots been blown from the brown skin pretty tone 
 I got it sown plus I'm bad to the bone 
 Its hot to def 
 Make you breathe yo last breath 
 We could take it to the streets 
 We could call the ref 
 Yo I'm makin' mad moves that's way to the top 
 Flip Mode is the squad and the Ramp wont stop 
 Niggas everywhere, DJ's everywhere rockin' to Ramps new beat 
 When I hear his music I can't help but get down like they do 
 I'm doin' what I gotta do 
 I hear Charlie 
 Rampage is the boss of New York 
 Yo I fill more fantasies than Mr. Rork 
 Don't eat pork 
 Rap is the game I start 
 Keep it movin, throw yo hands in the air 
 Shake yo ass like you just don't care 
 Shake yo ass like you just don't care 
 Shake yo ass like you just don't care 
 Take a look around, its plain to see that everybody's bopin to Ramps 
 New 
 Music in the street 
 I hear music in the street, and I hear a funky beat and I get down, 
 Oh 
 I get down 
 Niggas everywhere, DJ's everywhere rockin' to Ramps new beat 
 When I hear his music I can't help but get down like they do 
 Rock on Rock on Rock on...
