"Yo Mack, I don't even UNDERSTAND how they didn't understand you in 
 That Mary joint!" 
 "Yeah, I know, man." 
 "Kick that ol' robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, CRAZY JOINT!" 
 Just... like... Uniblab, robotic kickin' flab 
 My flavor be the badder 
 Chitter-chatter 
 Madder than the Mad Hatter (1) 
 I bet you my shit come out fatter 
 Got the data 
 To turn your body into antimatter (2) {...body into antimatter...} 
 And just like a piece of sizzlean 
 You'll fit inside my stomach 
 With the eggs and grits between {...take 'em down, Mack...} 
 The King is what I mean 
 I mean 
 My man get a cup 
 And put some change inside your hand {...take 'em down, Mack...} 
 Now hold up, 
 Let's make this official {...make it official} 
 Everybody let's agree that M.C.'s need a tissue {..wake 'em up} 
 The funk's my only issue, 
 I bet your mama miss you 
 And I bet the Mack take off like an M.X. missile 
 No more of your whining 
 On the charts climbing 
 As I make the funk 
 Kickin' out more harder than a diamond {...harder than a diamond} 
 And if you didn't know who's rhyming 
 I guess I'm gonna say Craig Mack 
 With perfect timing 
 ...You won't be around next year 
 My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear {...KICK IT DOWN!} 
 Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear 
 {...Brand new flava in ya ear...} 
 (Time for new flava in ya ear) 
 I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear 
 (Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...) 
 Craig Mack 
 1000 degrees 
 You'll be on your knees 
 And you'll be burnin', beggin' please 
 Brother FREEZE! {BOY!...} 
 Man's indisputed 
 And deep-booted 
 Funk smoke that leaves your brains booted 
 This bad M.C. 
 With stamina like Bruce Jenner (3) 
 The winner 
 Tasting M.C.'s for dinner 
 You're crazy like that glue {...you're crazy, boy, You're crazy.} 
 To think that you 
 Could out-do 
 My one-two 
 That's sick like the flu {...shake 'em down, Mack} 
 BOY, I flip 
 BOY all the time, 'cause 
 BOY, the rhyme you're kickin' {HA! BOY!...} 
 Ain't worth a dime 
 Seems like there's no competition 
 In this rap world expedition 
 You come around, 
 I'll knock you out [of] position {... knock 'em out!} 
 No flav 
 Could ever dig a grave 
 For the Mack 
 The power pack 
 In black 
 Makin' cement crack {...make it crack...} 
 ...And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear 
 Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear 
 Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear 
 {Here- comes- the- brand- new- flavor-... 
 (Time for new flava in ya ear) 
 ...In- your- ear... 
 I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear 
 ...Boy!} 
 (Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...) 
 {Flavor down...} 
 Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear 
 {Flavor, Flavor, here comes the flavor} 
 (Time for new flava in ya ear) 
 I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear 
 (Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...) 
 {Flavor in ya ear, boy...} 
 Ha! 
 The Mack's dope 
 With more hope than your Pope 
 But for M.C.'s more knots than rope 
 I'd like to break it down 
 Down-breakin' 
 Forsaken 
 Lords of M.C.'s shakin 
 With this track that my man's makin' 
 M.C.'s will run like a bomb threat 
 I bet {what?} 
 Or better yet {huh?} 
 Make you sweat 
 Gettin' hotter than the sun get {yup!} 
 Craig Mack is the flav that romps 
 From here to Tibet {BOY!} 
 I break all rules 
 With my action 
 That the Mack sends 
 To M.C.'s stop relaxin' 
 This brand new Sherrif that's in town's 
 Gettin' down 
 Leavin' bodies buried in the ground {...rest in peace...} 
 I set up rhymes for a decoy 
 To off a bad boy {Ooh!} 
 Watch the M.C.'s I destroy and... {BOY!} 
 Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear 
 {Time for new flavor... 
 (Time for new flava in ya ear) 
 ...Fla-VOR!} 
 I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear 
 {Time for the flav... 
 (Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...) 
 ...Boy, here come the Mack} 
 Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear 
 {Ha!... 
 (Time for new flava in ya ear) 
 ...Wakin' up with flavor!} 
 I'm kickin' brand new flava in ya ear 
 (Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear...) 
 {Ha!...boy...}
