(Rampage) 
 It's Atiya, Richard of Flatbush 
 Speak up 
 The word on the street is the Rampage return 
 Uh

 Hah, one time, two times, three times (no doubt), four times 
 All my real live niggas throw your hands up 
 All my real live bitches throw your hands up 
 All my hustler mother fuckers throw your hands up 
 All my bigger ass niggas throw your hands up 
 Hah! 
 (Rampage) 
 Check it out, like this y'all 
 The heavyweight Brooklyn bomber that can't rest 
 Love success, I'm gettin' money progress 
 Travellin for free from state to state 
 That's how I get my idea to create 
 I'm live motivate, I keep on movin, it's been FUBU 
 I make Def Jams like Rick Rubin 
 I stay on my tippy toes wreckin shows, I'm too slow 
 You can't peep my ill flow in this Burning Zone 
 Keep low like an Eskimo 
 Askin' people, still carry my flow, open the do' 
 It's the real outlaw, from Flatbush to South Shore 
 Givin' you more and more 
 I just came home from tour 
 It's my time to burn to explore 
 I'm comin' through the floor with Low X 
 I'm fully gassed to the max movin stacks, no fakin jacks 
 I'm the baddest man on the wax 
 Messin around with my Squad, you get taxed 
 Shittin' Ex-Lax, on hot tracks, I can't relax 
 Breakin' backs, with my NFL Quarterbacks 
 Flipmode deep we bring good things to light 
 Put down your gun and light 
 I'm in it to win it 
 Plus I'm wildin for da night

 Flip a script like Terri McMillan 
 I can't help the way I'm feelin'... 
 Caps is fillin', drugs is dealin' 
 My thug niggas keep illin' 
 Rampage is higher than the ceiling 
 Mad appealing brothers who dealin' from Brownsville and 
 I'm ready and willing I'm playin' lock and chase 
 You can get my black race 
 Bet I, hesitates, I'm movin cash like Chase 
 You about to get laced fifteen across your face 
 You at the wrong place, you at the wrong time 
 You didn't use your third vision mind, you sippin wine 
 Your vision is blind, no you can't see the victory 
 You in the street it's gettin' deep 
 You rolled up with the wrong peeps, you're the black sheep 
 You won't protest, drop when your little brother got shot (bang!) 
 It's gettin' hot, now you back around the way 
 With the same clothes, plus your bum hoes that you chose 
 They gave up your whereabouts, where you hang out 
 Who you hang wit, now you gotta get your dome split 
 You wildin for da night *echoes*
