If you love livin' your life, leave me alone. 
 I live the life, I sing about in my song. 
 They hate me until I'm gone. 
 They hate... they hate me until I'm gone 
 If you love livin' your life, leave me alone. 
 Z-Ro: 
 Fuck everybody lately 'cause it was fuck me first. 
 What's the reason for the season of wantin' to see me in a hearse? 
 It really don't matter 'cause I ride or die for me 
 Even if they kill me, there's happyness in the sky for me 
 So if it's death around the corner, I can't stop it if I wanna 
 Jesus, just let me empty my tip and hit my marijuana 
 Yeah I seen it comin' nobody gon' catch me off guard 
 Make 'em look me in my eye before they break me off Lord 
 Excuse my attitude but I'm use to negativity 
 My life explains my fuck everybody on each delivery 
 Some say it's the drugs, others say it's a lack of love 
 It ain't gotta be a reason, crazy simply just because 
 Everyday of my life has been a struggle and pain 
 So I perform with no emotion, no further need to explain 
 If you love livin' your life, leave me alone 
 Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song. 
 Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song 
 Nobody in the world loves me, they hate me until I'm gone. 
 What's Goin' On? Realizin' I'm goin' crazy 
 Everybody watchin' me suffer but won't nobody save me 
 This can't be life, I promise the world ain't shit 
 I never knew I'd lose my mind and end up like this 
 'Cause all I think is murder, realizin' I'm goin' crazy 
 Wait till they get a load of me, it's fuck everybody lately. 
 Z-Ro: 
 In my '73, rollin' on top of the trails 
 Let down my window and let my pistol excel 
 Disrespect me, revenge gon' represent me like a thief in the night 
 So prepare for permanent sleep in your life 
 I'm still a Christian on a mission but my vision ain't clear 
 Lookin' for peace, but all I see is drama down here 
 So when the goin' gets tough, the tough pull the team together 
 Who ride and get rid of our enemies together 
 But if you live by the sword then you die by it 
 So when it's time for me to go it ain't no need for me to cry about it 
 'Cause I done done my share of wrong doin' 
 Exaturated resolvable situations and left some homes ruined 
 Even niggas that call themselves friends 
 They'll be first to try to rob me and then do me in 
 So if you love livin' your life, leave me alone 
 Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song. 
 Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song 
 Nobody in the world loves me, they hate me until I'm gone. 
 What's Goin' On? Realizin' I'm goin' crazy 
 Everybody watchin' me suffer but won't nobody save me 
 This can't be life, I promise the world ain't shit 
 I never knew I'd lose my mind and end up like this 
 'Cause all I think is murder, realizin' I'm goin' crazy 
 Wait till they get a load of me, it's fuck everybody lately. 
 Z-Ro: 
 What's Goin' On? Realizin' I'm on the edge 
 My every thought is aggravated assault and get my bread 
 For the love of money, muthafuckers disappear 
 That's the very reason, Joseph McVey keep his pistol near 
 Come and get me, so you can put your hands on my riches 
 The only alliby I need to squeeze it and ain't diggin' ditches 
 But if I gotta kiss my freedom goodbye 
 I tongue kiss my 10 millimeter 'cause she didn't let me die 
 That's a down ass bitch, mayne 
 Unlike my friends 'cause just to get some ends they 10 to spit names 
 24/7-365, nobody at my side 
 They might hit me up before they help me hide 
 So I roll by myself or I roll with Trae. Straight like that. 
 A.B.N. for life, focused on makin' the world pay 
 If you love livin' your life, leave me alone 
 Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song. 
 Fuck rap, I live the life I sing about in my song 
 Nobody in the world loves me, they hate me until I'm gone.
