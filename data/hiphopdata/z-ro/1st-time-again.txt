(Chorus: Ashanti) 
 You came into my world and taught me things. 
 And I can't lie 'cause boy you did yo' things. 
 Feel like I'm floatin' when I hear yo' name. 
 I think you made me fall in love again. 
 Z-Ro: Over Chorus: 
 Okay. 
 Screwed Up Click. 
 Yeah. 
 Z-Ro: 
 Whenever you need a nigga call me up I'm on my way 
 Sex or serious conversation, I'll listen to what you have to say 
 This ain't gotta C about a wham bam thank you ma'am 
 I'm not like these other fellas although I know you think I am 
 Even though I kick it with alot of... (females) 
 I can honestly tell you that I ain't gotta... (female) 
 But since I'm fresh out of hell you probably thank that I just wanna bone 
 Hit it, quit it, then delete your number from my mobile phone. 
 Can't you see the tattoo reads one deep? 
 So I need only one lil' mama, one cup of codeine and one Swisher sweet 
 The weight of the world is on my shoulders because I'm thuggin' 
 But sometimes even the hardest of us need some lovin' 
 And the 1st Time with you is like my 1st Time Again 
 Like rediscoverin' rap music, writin' my 1st rhyme again 
 You say you feel like your floatin' well I'm floatin' too 
 Everybody's leavin' now you know what it's time for you & Z-Ro to do. 
 (Chorus: Ashanti) 
 You came into my world and taught me things. 
 And I can't lie 'cause boy you did yo' things. 
 Feel like I'm floatin' when I hear yo' name. 
 I think you made me fall in love again. 
 Z-Ro: 
 Now tell the truth; I'm like a mechanic when I work my tool 
 So brace yourself baby so I can hit you with The Mule 
 Everytime I touch ya I'm a find a new hot spot, it's guaranteed 
 I'm a thug nigga but still a romantic so pass the seed 
 Now you ain't no dime piece, you a whole dollar 
 And I'd rather be givin' you "Fuck Faces" 
 Ain't tryin' to pay these hoes no bother 
 You see I consider myself as a king 
 But I can't reach a comfort zone till I find myself a queen 
 So we can rule together, it's picture perfect me and you together 
 Go through our good and bad moods together 
 Plus I'm concerned if you don't come home 
 Long as you call me and let me know you all right I'm a stay off of your phone 
 Ain't none of that drivin' by your mama house or callin' private 
 The way you hug me when you see me let me know you my chick 
 And I ain't scared to put that icin' on your finger either 
 You're my sunny day when it be rainin' 
 It's a blessin' mama sing for the future. 
 (Chorus: Ashanti) 
 You came into my world and taught me things. 
 And I can't lie 'cause boy you did yo' things. 
 Feel like I'm floatin' when I hear yo' name. 
 I think you made me fall in love again. 
 Z-Ro: 
 Me and you is like a feelin' that I get when I roll on 22's 
 And I'm a keep you stylin' when I'm shoppin' for you, plenty ice, plenty clothes, plenty shoes 
 But don't get it confused, I ain't trickin' 'cause I'm pimpin' 
 But without you in my life I would be barely livin' mayne 
 What we do in my arms is like doja to the brain 
 I promise you like a drug your much better than everything. 
 Now if I was to try to hold in this love, I would choke 
 'Cause it's some potent shit like from Humboldt County on the West coast 
 Yeah I think I fell in love again, it's on 
 It's so real I feel I won't have to make another "I Hate You Bitch" song. 
 (Chorus: Ashanti] [x2) 
 You came into my world and taught me things. 
 And I can't lie 'cause boy you did yo' things. 
 Feel like I'm floatin' when I hear yo' name. 
 I think you made me fall in love again.
