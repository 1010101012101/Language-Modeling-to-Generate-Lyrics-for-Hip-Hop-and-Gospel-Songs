Point Blank talking: 
 This for all the DJ A B C D's, wannabe muthafuckers 
 Whoever you is, my nigga DJ Screw created this style 
 It's here to stay. 
 Do what you do, but you gon' respect my nigga Screw. 
 (Hook: Point Blank) 
 What the fuck y'all niggas talkin' 'about? Screw Did That. 
 You can chop it but respect the fact. Screw Did That. 
 Who put this game or flag on the map? Screw Did That. 
 What? Screw Did That. Man, Screw Did That. 
 Who slowed you records down and made the style? Screw Did That. 
 Longest rappers up 'about freestyle. Screw Did That. 
 Now they sippin' syrup worldwide. Screw Did That. 
 Tip your muthafuckin' hats nigga. Screw Did That. 
 Point Blank: 
 What the fuck y'all niggas talkin' 'about? Time for me to break it down 
 At home suckin' your mama titty, when I was runnin' the underground 
 I been here done this, now you hoes got me pissed 
 Fuckin' over my homey name over one punk ass minute of fame 
 If you true to the game act like it then, show some respect 
 Y'all niggas bore me, show some kind of muthafuckin' loyalty 
 DJ Screw the king of the chop, yeah king of the chop 
 He the reason now alot of these muthafuckers hot 
 But they ain't hollin' at Mama and Papa Screw, like they supposed to 
 Don't forget, don't nobody own shit but those 2 
 That go for friends and foes too, bitches and hoes too 
 Don't stand there with your mouth wide open nigga, do what you do 
 Sentimental Value, the only authentic original Screw 
 We keepin' the dream alive and payin' the family too 
 Mama Screw told me, you got my permission to spill the gases 
 And when you scream, scream loud and set fire under that asses.

 Who went from Chimmy Chang to worldwide? Screw Did That. 
 Took me from nothin' and made me something, you did that 
 I owe it all to you my nigga, for helpin' me rise 
 I thought you would get old with me. Why the fuck you have to die? 
 Everybody S.U.C. now. Screwed and Chopped by who? 
 Probably never met the man, deserve the ghetto. Are you bent? 
 Each nigga you get out of dodge fast 
 5,000 Watts of skills, 5,000 pounds of trash 
 Watch what you say in the magazines, old fat ass nigga 
 Steady nibblin' off my niggas cheese, old rat ass nigga 
 I call it like I see it & I can't be nothin' but real 
 I guess they can't originate so they do nothin' but steal 
 I'm sick & I'm tired, I'm not gon' let it ride no more 
 Better skip town 'cause in Houston you hoes can't hide no more 
 My partner Robert Earl Davis was a man out of music 
 But the world kickin' so much they bitch made bold niggas be tryin' to do it.

 Point Blank: 
 He slowed the record down and made the style, now everybody on dick 
 Michael "5000" Watts in Murder Dog talkin' 'about he elevated this shit 
 Screw's number 1, always will be 
 You got the game from him, the style was named after him 
 One thing he promised is that the world was gon' be all screwed up 
 I was on a first Screw tape to hit the market, All Screwed Up 
 Yeah it's hard to think when yo' mind go blank. 
 Don't believe it? Run yo' ass in the paint 
 See when that Keke Pimpin' Pens, we all was makin' paper 
 Drank up and dripped out while they got high with the Blanksta 
 All I wanna do is remember the good times 
 Botany was and still the block that stayed crunk at all times 
 Al-D, Z-Ro and the S.U.C. is still in effect 
 Screw you restin' in peace and they still on yo' muthafuckin' dick! 
 Z-Ro: 
 Candy blue Impala matter of fact, Screw Blue 
 Touchin' nothin' but real records no jammin' no do do 
 But fuck the melody, that was my man 
 When I was slippin' he would reach out and take my hand 
 'Cause it was nothin' but love for my nigga, nigga had love for me 
 So disrespect him and it's gonna be some slugs to see 
 Bitch we the Screwed Up Click, down South we the shit 
 Body rockin' like this with Mama Screw up in the mix. 
 Point Blank talking:
