 Z-Ro: 
 Early in the morning, I daydream 'cause I'm locked down. And I can't help but, to reminisce about when I was back in H-Town. When I was ridin' candy blue piece and chain hangin' doin' my thang in R-A-P... But now I can't help but to wonder if God has forgotten about me. I can still taste the juicy sour... it ain't never been too sweet... and I never did nothing to nobody... jus tried to stay up on my feet. Why does it seem like everybody wanna see me B-R-O-K-E... y'all can eeeaaattt... a meaty dick baby, I know you wanna see me fall, but I want it all man these haters got me wrong. 
 Haters got me wrong... haters got me wroooong... Haters got me wro-ooh-ong.
