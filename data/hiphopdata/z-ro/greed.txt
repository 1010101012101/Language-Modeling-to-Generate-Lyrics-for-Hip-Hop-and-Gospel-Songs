Z-Ro: 
 Look I knew this fella named frank who had bank from pullin manuvers 
 No descrimination for fity his brother will do ya 
 His whole life he been broke but he got tired of the feelin' 
 Started indulgin in drug dealin', was'nt scared to be caterpillan 
 A soldier but for the wrong 'cause he bosted screamin give it up you give it up or else you got toasted 
 Kept his finger on the trigger every time he rode frank took all the drug dealers and kept his hood sowed 
 Mafia menace to his community his money was long 
 Wouldn't let his partners make no money let alone sell stones flippin in the finest of cars gator shoes and boots chinchila furs even hers double breasted blue suits for him and his broad but where was god not around his riches 'cause he quickly fell in a 6 foot ditch to deep him and his misses 
 The moral of the story if you sowed it I promise you'll reap it greed ain't nothin' but a lesson so listen up when I teach it 
 Greed, vanity, lust the main three things that will make you end up in the dust 
 Its seven sins that women and men commit 24-7 you better watch it or get 187 I'm trying to tell ya

 Get Out the mirror little mamma cause you look good enough already degrated your image cause your hood slut walkin' in and out of house jumpin' in and out of cars got to many boyfriends thinkin' you lovem from the heart you just tryin' to get into their pockets you's a gold digger actin' like you down like four flats to get some more figas steady throwin' marriage in their face to make them believe better not make nobody fall in love 'cause they might make you bleed 
 Fake nails and fake hair on down to your thighs ain't nothin' but imatation your whole life is a lie you need to slow down and get a grip on yourself before you catch somethin' you can't throw back and HIV yourself 
 Your phone ain't ringing cause fellas see you loosen weight you ain't even confident no more looks like you loosen faith everyday 
 The moral of the story sowe it and you'll reap it vanity ain't nothin' but a lesson listen up while I teach it
