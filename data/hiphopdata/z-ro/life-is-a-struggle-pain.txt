 Life Is A Struggle and Pain, I can't see the 
 Sunny days 'fore the rain, G O D please 
 Help me to maintain, because I don't wanna die 
 If I'm livin' in vein. 
 Cl'Che: 
 Sometimes I just wanna scream 
 But I know G O D will make it right for me 
 When I feel like I can't take no more of these rugged streets 
 I let him take over, now my mind is free from worries 
 So many negatives I can't fall 
 Got my cheese and Pac's are posted on my wall 
 If I make any more mistakes I can now learn from 'em all 'cause I'm grown now 
 I found him, so you know I'm strong now 
 I write my songs with plenty of pride 
 For my people that done burned strowns for years and died. 
 Don't you wanna grow over your child so you can know who you are? 
 Instead of puttin' the world on pause, just to drive that fancy car 
 Hey boy, I want you to feel me now 
 Cl'Che know you got it pain won't love you anyhow 
 Need you to help that little sister you know, build some esteem 
 You wanna know what's on her mind and not in her jeans 
 Let's make this world a better place for the livin' 
 Let's make our minds a better place for thinkin' and listenin' 
 For my people, let's try to make a change 
 'Cause I don't wanna die if I'm livin' in vein.

 Z-Ro: 
 Even with God in my life it's still hard in my life 
 Muthafuckers call it so close to be fraud in my life 
 And I can't understand, Z-Ro ain't doin' no wrong 
 That's probably why they be fuckin' with me, thinkin' I'm all song 
 But it's all gravy you wanna hate me then go on hate me 
 'Cause I've been lookin' for reasons to take it off safety 
 And a muthafucker don't make me for me, lay me feelin' on me 
 Like nobody don't really want me, the pressure creepin' up on me 
 I wonder what happy is 'cause I've never known it 
 People I meet ain't partners, they potential opponents 
 Cloudy days and the place that I come from runnin' from cops 
 Put it down in the alley way when they pass I'm bustin' some shots 
 Sorry God, I know I ain't got no business sellin' dope and trippin' God 
 Just show me some inspiration when you see me slippin' God 
 'Cause when I die I don't want it to be in vein 
 I'd rather serve in Heaven, won't be in the King in the flame.

 Cl'Che: 
 Know you can go anywhere you wanna go 
 You can be anything you wanna be 
 You can see anything you wanna see 
 If you keep G O D first everyday 
 You it hurts, the daily livin' while you flippin' 
 Through your hood with your partners kickin' 
 Click trippin' don't know why he had a short livin' 
 You don't know, yeah you know 
 He ain't the first, oh how the truth hurts. 
 Z-Ro: 
 So I'm a go where I wanna go 
 And if I'm pressin' for a fo' that's what I'm gonna blow 
 Long as my bills paid and my rent paid, it's all gravy 
 'Cause when I was on this ain't not one of my people saved me 
 Life Is A Struggle & A Pain, but I'm maintainin' 
 I pray I won't get found naked with my brains hangin' 
 Too many niggas tryin' to get me for my paper stack 
 So I'm a be 'about a player, now where the haters at.
