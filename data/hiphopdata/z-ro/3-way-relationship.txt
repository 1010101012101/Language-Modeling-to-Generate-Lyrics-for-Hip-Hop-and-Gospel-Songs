Say 'cause like this here, I'm a stay strapped nigga 
 I'm a keep me bitch nigga. You understand me? Believe that 
 She loves a nigga, real talk nigga 
 Make way for a muthafuckin' gangsta, loc'd up G'd up 
 At all muthafuckin' times homeboy, real talk 
 Get it how you live jack. 
 (It's a Big E beat) 
 Z-Ro: 
 I got a gangsta chick & a classy girl 
 I can't decide which one I wanna be with, it's drivin' me crazy 
 The one that's good want me out of the hood 
 But the other one be buggin' givin' me reasons to keep on thuggin' 
 One of my girls got big ass breasts' and wide hips 
 The other one is a 40 with a 30 round clip 
 She the reason I'm still breathin' y'all know what it is 
 Yeah I love her, but she can't give me kids 
 And she can't run my bath water for me or roll me a cigarillo 
 Ain't no sex either, she just gon' lay under the pillow 
 But it's still a 3some 'cause my other lil' mama be in the bed too 
 Doin' everything sexy black gon' do 
 But black ain't able to catch an attitude with me 
 Over nonsense, baby argue and act a fool with me. 
 I need to make a decision, but when? 
 'Cause all I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend. 
 (You know I'm down with you, through all the up's & downs with you 
 I feel like we can make this work) 
 I need to make a decision, I don't know who to choose 
 Either way I win, but I still lose, hey. 
 (Baby you know I ride for you, whenever you want me to 
 I'm the one that makes sure you don't get hurt) 
 I need to make a decision, I don't know who to choose 
 Walkin' in a regular man's or a gangsta's shoes, hey. 
 She can't do it to you like this, she can't give it to you like that 
 She can't even let you hit it from the back 
 I'm the reason you can breath easy, I'm the reason everybody fear you 
 The bitch that won't let trouble come near you 
 I'm the one you can lean on when times get hard 
 The one that's tryin' to bring you closer to God 
 Yeah but when it get gangsta, all she gon' do is run and hide 
 I'm a hold you down baby, just think of me while tomorrow die. 
 Z-Ro: 
 Stuck between affection and protection 
 My girl and my weapon, this situation's got me stressin' 
 Yeah I'm a Hoover gangsta crip but I'm a man first 
 Even still I find myself fingerin' sexy black until my hand hurts 
 Dumpin' on my enemies to save my life 
 With intentions on gettin' laid tonight 
 So I guess in the end, all I need in this life of sin 
 Is me and both of my girlfriends. 
 (You know I'm down with you, through all the up's & downs with you

 Z-Ro: 
 Sexy black listen, if the police get you and me then I'll end up in prison 
 5 years minimum what they givin' 
 That's the reason why I chuck you out the window, when they pull up on my rear 
 Come back and scoop you later when the coast is clear 
 And baby girl, you already know how I feel about you 
 I can't picture myself livin' without you 
 But in this bidness I'm in, it's do or die that's why 
 I keep my gangsta bitch at my side when I ride. Is you feelin' me? 
 Would you rather picture someone killin' me? 
 3 shots to the dome, have you wonderin' why I ain't came home 
 For me sexy black is necessary, like commissary when I'm in hell 
 'Cause murderers and jackers be givin' me hell 
 So fuck it, let's have a menizzle twizzle 
 One of y'all on my left one of y'all on my right and me in the middle 
 Something beautiful is about to begin 'cause all I need in this life of sin 
 Is me and both of my girlfriends.
