(Hook: Z-Ro) 
 I Never Had Love for a bitch, I'm about my money 
 Even if they murder me, I ain't goin' nowhere 
 Turn up the volume to the radio, I'll be right there 
 And I Never Had Love for a nigga, I'm about my money 
 I'm a million dollar mack, that's how I carry myself 
 And can't no girl have my heart 'cause I'm gon' marry myself. 
 Z-Ro: 
 My first diss song that, yeah that used to be me 
 Every Sunday morning and every Wednesday night I would be 
 At Crestmont Church of Christ, just my Daddy and me 
 But I know he didn't love me, because I was raised by the streets 
 Never took the time to teach me about the birds and the bees 
 I don't even know if he was proud of me for makin' A's & B's 
 West Fewquay and Ridgevan made me a man 
 Took my first onion rocked it up & I made me a grand 
 17 years ago is just like yesterday, I remember it well 
 Young nigga goin' to school, workin' hustlin' 
 And livin' on the street, I was goin' through hell 
 And I've got no regrets, but I'm not finished yet 
 I know I've come along way, but it's so far to go 
 And since ain't none of y'all muthafuckers helped Z-Ro, that's right.

 Z-Ro: 
 Y'all already know what they want from me 
 Simply to see me B R O K E & D E A D 
 I can't escape the H A T E 
 My baby mama's make me wanna just squeeze the trigger 
 Feelin' like the world don't need me nigga 
 Seems like none of my daughters hardly see me nigga 
 I'm sorry baby, you know your Daddy crazy 
 Seems like your mama's always got a problem with Ro 
 I done put up with it long enough, I ain't gon' take it no more 
 If I'm not appreciated, it's time for me to go 
 I'd rather they file child support, I'm a just send the dough 
 Time is passin' by & I ain't even there to see you grow 
 Life is hard but it's fair & I promise I'm a be there but uh...

 Z-Ro: 
 I'm laughin' at y'all bitch niggas like "Aha!" 
 Mad at me 'cause I'm in a Bentley when I slide by 
 Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacob, Gucci or Prada 
 Nobody but me cuts slices out of my pie 
 I'm ridin' dirty but my ride's so clean 
 It's like a pamper full of baby shit and Irish Spring 
 Bitch, you ain't nothin' but a greasy split 
 Payin' me money the only way you can please me bitch 
 I'm a walkin' talkin' ass whippin' I'm the squab father 
 If it's more than one nigga, that's when I squab harder 
 Somebody need to be murdered, I got a job offer 
 I got that concrete, these other boy's hard softer 
 My bitch get off the plane, you can get that hard off her 
 You could get that bottom and that head bob off her 
 Before I love a bitch, I'm shoppin' for shoes 
 And all the bitch bread is mine, but the cock is for you, you trick.
