They say success is the best revenge 
 That's the reason I'm always on my grind 
 I promise to God, I ain't got no paper to lend 
 Y'all motherfuckers must be out y'all mind 
 And I don't really give a fuck if you be family or friend 
 I ain't giving up one God damn dime 
 I'm leaving all you bitches behind 
 I'm leaving all you bitches behind, that's right 
 Z-Ro the Crooked, King of the Ghetto, and the Mo City Don 
 That's a hell of a man 
 And he ain't trying to buy no wolf tickets either homie 
 So ain't no use in selling 'em man 
 You damn right a hell of a hustle ain't gon get you nothing but some hell of a grands 
 No feeling like money in my hand 
 Money over bitches I know you understand, that's right 
 I'm doing just fine, homie I don't need no help 
 Especially when it comes to spending my wealth 
 I'm doing just fine, I'm one deep because I love myself 
 Envy and jealousy is bad for my health 
 I'm doing just fine, without you in my life 
 I don't need you in my life, I don't want you in my life 
 All I want, is the cash 
 All of y'all can kiss my ass 
 I'm still a gangsta, pussy niggaz better stay up out my way 
 Frown on my face I'm holding my H.K. 
 Handling bidness digging ditches everyday hey 
 Still a gangsta, pussy niggaz better stay up out my way 
 And I'm a be a real nigga till I'm old and grey 
 And the whole world wanna know just what I've got to say 
 S.U.C., until I D-I-E 
 That's all I ever will be 
 I'm a keep holding it down, and doing this damn thing for my town 
 None of you bitches ain't gotta come around 
 And it's gon be like that till I'm in the ground that's right 
 I'm doing just fine, homie I don't need no help 
 Especially when it comes to spending my wealth 
 I'm doing just fine, I'm one deep because I love myself 
 Envy and jealousy is bad for my health 
 I'm doing just fine, without you in my life 
 I don't need you in my life, I don't want you in my life 
 All I want, is the cash 
 All of y'all can kiss my ass 
 I use to have a love jones for this chick named Lisa 
 Now my love jones is for the Mastercard or the Visa 
 Ain't no love in my heart, homie it's col' like Keisha 
 Nine ounces in the door panel, a couple of mo' in the speaker 
 I get a ticket down in Texas, ain't gon give 'em a reason 
 To put me in jail it's even, and gone a couple of seasons 
 I'm trying to stack my paper taller than a great dane 
 Joseph Wayne McVey ain't saving no bitches, 'cause he ain't got a cape mayn 
 Bitch, you ain't smoking my weed for free 
 And don't offer me none of your raggedy booty, that ain't nothing to me 
 And while y'all getting-getting some head, I'm getting-getting some bread 
 And while y'all fellas relaxing, I'll be getting-getting ahead 
 Screwed Up Click until I die 
 Mayn I'm so high, I don't think I can drive 
 That's why I'm riding shotgun, with my shotgun 
 One nigga disrepect, and get your whole block done, done 
 I'm doing just fine, homie I don't need no help 
 Especially when it comes to spending my wealth 
 I'm doing just fine, I'm one deep because I love myself 
 Envy and jealousy is bad for my health 
 I'm doing just fine, without you in my life 
 I don't need you in my life, I don't want you in my life 
 All I want, is the cash 
 All of y'all can kiss my ass
