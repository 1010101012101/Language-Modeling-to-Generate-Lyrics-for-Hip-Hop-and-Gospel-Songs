Z-Ro: 
 Forgive me for my sins 'cause I'm not perfect 
 Just tryin' to get it like I live. But is it really worth it? 
 Niggas done fell to my heater, never to rise up 
 I didn't really wanna hurt nobody, please open your eyes up 
 Don't need no more blood on my conscious 
 Even though I'm a soldier, I feel pain 
 Got a nigga paranoid around partners, I feel strange 
 Watchin' my back, cockin' my ghat, strapped at all times 
 Punishin' muthafuckers just for crossin' that line 
 My only company is lonely mess 'cause most of these niggas be fake & I can't stand phoniness 
 Can't even look me in my eye before they burn me up 
 2 to the head, but it ain't that simple y'all can't turn me up dead 
 Best believe retaliation is a must, I'm a bust with fury 
 Look at me laugh at my competition flashin' my jewelry 
 Death ain't around the corner no more, he up in my face 
 It's only natural to try to steal him and put him back in his place. 
 (Chorus: Z-Ro) 
 In case I don't Make It, I wanna tell my people I love 'em 
 I wish I could jump up out my casket and hug 'em 
 Just in case I don't Make It, I hope they keep on jammin' my songs 
 A military minded muthafucker gone 
 Just in case I don't Make It, I wanna tell my people I love 'em 
 I wish I could jump up out my casket and hug 'em 
 Just in case I don't Make It, don't cry now, I'm still in your hearts 
 I hope I get to go to Heaven, my Lord. 
 Z-Ro: 
 In case I don't Make It, I want niggas to know I never gave up 
 Z-Ro VS. the World and King of Tha Ghetto is when I came up 
 People showin' me love, people showin' me hate 
 But I put the street with my business and put more change in my safe 
 Special thanks to Eugene Brooks, it ain't another realer 
 Save me from being a drug dealer, but still a gorilla 
 Death ain't around the corner no more, he up in my face 
 Only natural to try to steal him and put him back in his place. 
 Mexican D.: 
 A young Mexican brought up in the wrong way of life 
 I had to do what I had to do just to Make It through the night 
 Hustlin' robbin' killin' runnin' the streets with no feelings 
 An aggravated muthafucker that is ready as willin' 
 So leave me alone, before I touch your dome 
 Or sendin' automatic .45's, to hit your home 
 'Cause ain't no playin' with me, I'm a down ass G 
 Showin' no pity, from that Mo' City. 
 (Chorus: Z-Ro) 
 In case I don't Make It, I wanna tell my people I love 'em 
 I wish I could jump up out my casket and hug 'em 
 Just in case I don't Make It, I hope they keep on jammin' my songs 
 A military minded muthafucker gone 
 Just in case I don't Make It, I wanna tell my people I love 'em 
 I wish I could jump up out my casket and hug 'em 
 Just in case I don't Make It, don't cry now, I'm still in your hearts 
 I hope I get to go to Heaven, my Lord. 
 Z-Ro: 
 I've been goin' insane lately 
 Rollin' with my gun off safety 
 Thinkin' everybody's out to do me 
 Can't even relax, Mac 11 by the jacuzzi 
 Gangstafied, ever since then showin' me love 
 And it don't matter where they're at, nigga they gon' hit you with the dub 
 But every night I pray to see another foo foo day 
 Even though sometime I fall off track, trickin' with Mary J. 
 Can't I get a piece of mind? Everybody wanna attack me 
 In the beginnin' them was strays, but now they bustin' right at me 
 Get up out my ride homey, don't wanna ride with me now 
 If we rollin' & I'm beefin' you can die with me now 
 Niggas around me droppin' like flies, it got a nigga scared 
 Bullet proof & a automatic, come with makin' blood shed 
 So just in case I don't Make It, tell my enemies fuck 'em 
 I wish I could jump up out my casket and bust 'em! 
 (Chorus: Z-Ro) 
 In case I don't Make It, I wanna tell my people I love 'em 
 I wish I could jump up out my casket and hug 'em 
 Just in case I don't Make It, I hope they keep on jammin' my songs 
 A military minded muthafucker gone 
 Just in case I don't Make It, I wanna tell my people I love 'em 
 I wish I could jump up out my casket and hug 'em 
 Just in case I don't Make It, don't cry now, I'm still in your hearts 
 I hope I get to go to Heaven, my Lord.
