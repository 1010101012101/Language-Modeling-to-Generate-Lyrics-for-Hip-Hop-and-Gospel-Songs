 (Verse 1: Chamillionaire) 
 I keep that wallet with the ward so I'm ridin' with the noise 
 Plus the clip is fully loaded it's thee inside of my garage 
 Cars, look at all my broads if you tryin' to see the stars 
 Find me and you goin' feel like you done find your way to Mars 
 The paper punctuated, yeah that's the new philosophy 
 A G I gotta be on top of that like an apostrophe 
 Fame must have got to me, confidants has got to be 
 I autograph myself, write a check and make it out to me 
 Beggers can't be choosers, go and get a ruler 
 Chain extra long like Will Chainalin's majulia 
 Other known as Koopa, ain't nobody cooler 
 Brain is a thing and she love to be my tutor 
 She loving my calone, huh, recognize the odor 
 Must of smell money, Ben Franklin's what I told her 
 Chris-talamatoda, Big swangers on my Roder 
 So they talkin' about my money in the city like promoters.

 'Cause I been feelin' the strangest feelin' lately. 
 Chamillionaire:

 (Verse 3: Paul Wall) 
 You do what I do then you would know what's in my bank account 
 And you would know why those that talk too much then we ain't hangin' out 
 Raspy runnin' the traps & I ain't hangin' around with Danger Mouse 
 Walkin' in the Forbes, could of swore I heard my name announced 
 They talkin' about no doe but wonderin' why I'm so rude to you 
 I only talk that dollar, talk that digit, talk that nume-rule 
 Chill with all that gossipin' this business as usual 
 Ben Franklin passed away & I was present at the funeral 
 He breaking in my house (dawg) I hope that what you ain't about 
 I keep a Mike Vick, so I hope you good at breakin' out 
 Breakin' in my vault (No) I hope this heater make you doubt 
 I got the right to think that I'm the best because I paid the cost.
