Chorus: Z-Ro 
 Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect somethin' around here (round here) 
 Cause a nigga will never hesitate, disrespect and I'm going up in yo chest playa (chest playa) 
 Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect somethin' around here (around here) 
 Gots to be a G till the day that I'm gone 
 So you better done knock it tell ya this ain't just a song 
 Try'na maintain 
 Try'na keep from going in a bitch nigga's brain 
 Seem like Rap-A-Lot ain't coming up with the chain (ain't coming up with the chain) 
 Ain't that a bitch, every since 2004 I was suppose to be rich 
 Y'all already know my name I released nothing but hits 
 And these niggas hate me 'cause they baby mommas on my dick 
 I'm a G 
 Never been a H.O.E. 
 Sippin' codiene and smoking weed 
 Rest in peace to my brother M.O.E. 
 Disco Danny, we ridin' on 4's and the three hundred is candy 
 If them jackers wanna trip I keep that ammunition handy 
 Screwed Up Click until I die 
 Man I'm so high, I don't think I can drive 
 That's why I'm ridin' shotgun with my shotgun 
 One nigga's disrespect and get cha' whole block done, done 
 Chorus: Z-Ro 
 Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect somethin' around here (round here) Cause a nigga will never hesitate, disrespect and I'm going up in yo chest play (chest play) Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect somethin' around here (around here) Gots to be a G till the day that I'm gone So you better done knock it tell ya this ain't just a song 
 Billy Cook: 
 You bitches don't want none, I'm busting my tommy gun 
 Snitches you better run, I slap haters for fun 
 I'm an R&B gangsta (down with my gangsta) 
 A Mo City heavy weightier (about my paper) 
 I ain't taking shit from you bitches no mo 
 Sometimes through these niggas really be hoes 
 You wanna be big tight, all about the limelight 
 Artist wannabe, all up in my spotlight 
 Youse a hoe in my book, con-artist and a crook 
 Bigchizz with my trust that a bitch nigga took 
 I ain't playing no games on a hundred fuck change 
 I ain't playing no games on a hundred fuck change 
 Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect somethin' around here 
 Gots to be a G till the day that I'm gone 
 So you better done knock it tell ya this ain't just a song 
 Chorus: Z-Ro 
 Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect somethin' around here (round here) Cause a nigga will never hesitate, disrespect and I'm going up in yo chest play (chest play) Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect somethin' around here (around here) Gots to be a G till the day that I'm gone So you better done knock it tell ya this ain't just a song 
 This is my world... 
 Z-Ro, King of the Ghetto 
 That's right, King of the Ghetto Entertainment in this bitch tonight 
 I'm a gangsta, pussy niggas better stay up out my way 
 Frown on my face I'm holding my AK 
 Handling business digging ditches everyday 
 Hey. 
 When ever you muthafuckas used to call my phone 
 I never told you no 
 The same muthafuckas left me all alone 
 That's why my name is Z-Ro 
 It ain't nobody putting me in my world 
 I'm not worried about anybody fucking my girl 
 You can have that hoe mayne, I just want the doe mayne 
 Mo City in this bitches, Billy Cook and Z-Ro mayne 
 Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect somethin' around here (round here) Cause a nigga will never hesitate, disrespect and I'm going up in yo chest play (chest play) Y'all niggas better act like y'all respect somethin' around here (around here) Gots to be a G till the day that I'm gone So you better done knock it tell ya this ain't just a song
