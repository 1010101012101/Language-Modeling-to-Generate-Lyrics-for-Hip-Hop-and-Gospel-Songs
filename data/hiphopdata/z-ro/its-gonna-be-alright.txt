 Z-Ro: 
 Too many problems in my life I find myself unable to maintain 
 The nigga that was takin' over my brain 
 Redesignin' my main frame 
 Developin' so much hatred I feel like fuck all of y'all 
 And for the slightest disrespect I would gladly touch all of y'all 
 Dedicated to doin' bad and addicted to drama 
 People think I'm missin' manners at home trainin' but I'm just missin' my mama 
 It's like I don't fit in this bullshit world 
 Surrounded by bullshit boys and bullshit bitches 
 Better murder they own people before they come up 
 And that's why I be mean muggin' every son of a bitch that walk or run up 
 I'm paranoid my nigga, I keep one in the chamber 
 Willin' to trade my freedom for life and live among strangers 
 My goal is to become 110 years old 
 I found myself but I can't grow until I find my soul 
 Stuck on 25 but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it 
 Receivin' hard pain from L.O.V.E. but I'll take it. 
 It's Gonna Be All right 
 Keep your head up to the sky. 
 'Cause everything's gon' be all right. 
 It's Gonna Be All right 
 Keep your head up to the sky.

 Dear Dorothy I know your lookin' at your son from Heaven 
 Totally clean and blessed green without drugs and weapons 
 Wish I could open up the pearly gates and see your face 
 But I gotta sinful life mama & I might not get to see that place 
 I just can't keep my cool, muthafuckers be messin' with the wrong weapon 
 I pull out my Jimmy Bone switchblade and start cuttin' 
 Nigga you ain't never known pain, you don't want this in your juggular vein 
 Rusty blades make aim cream spread like mayonnaise magn 
 I can't think of nothin' that made me feel like that dro 
 Not even a girl 'cause as quick as she comes she out the door' 
 Can't put my trust up in Eve 'cause she got tricks up her sleeve 
 All I wanna do is live until I'm D.E.A.D. 
 Of natural causes I don't need nobody knockin' me off 
 Just let me fall bitch get out the way you blockin' me off 
 Stuck in the same spot but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it 
 Disrespected by the people I love, but I'll take it. 
 It's Gonna Be All right 
 Keep your head up to the sky. 
 'Cause everything's gon' be all right. 
 It's Gonna Be All right 
 Keep your head up to the sky. 
 'Cause everything's gon' be all right. 
 It's Gonna Be All right 
 Keep your head up to the sky. 
 'Cause everything's gon' be all right. 
 It's Gonna Be All right 
 Keep your head up to the sky.
