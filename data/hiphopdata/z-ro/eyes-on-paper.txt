 Z-Ro: 
 Uh 
 I was down on my last down with my stomach touching my back 
 Instead of my partner's helping me I was what they were laughing at 
 Can't approach the girl of your dreams with pro-wiens and wragger jeans 
 So wife five-four shirt with the collar, plus no dollar 
 It's been a long time since I slept outside, next door to my daddy house 
 Back then Darrell Louis would smack they Junior in my daddy house 
 I'm not trippin' I'm actually glad that they turned there backs on me 
 Fuck family and fuck friends too, It's just me and my strap homie 
 Yeah I was that nerd nigga yestraday the day I rapped homie 
 A pocket full of pencils but came a pistol in my lap homie 
 I was voted most likely to become a teacher 
 Everybody class is in session put'cha ears up and a mirror speaker 
 And the day's lesser than simple if you don't work, you don't eat 
 And the lowest level of a man is when he is living on the street 
 Whatever you put in the game, the game goin' give back to you playa 
 That's why my mind ain't on these bitches, I keep my mind on paper

 [Z-Ro:] I got to keep my hands on swoll 
 [Paul Wall:] Keep my mind on that paper 
 Keep my eyes on my paper 
 Keep my mind on my paper (I got to keep my hands on swoll) 
 Keep my eyes on my paper 
 Paul Wall: 
 I got my mind on that paper, mayn 
 I'm thinking 'bout them stacks 
 My motivation is being solds in Cadillac's 
 My decoration is candy coats and super posts 
 My worst nightmare's waking up and being broke 
 My mind frame is go get it with no excuse 
 If all that crying though help me, then tell me what's the use? 
 My hustle schedule is all night and all day 
 If there some paper to be made, then I'm on the way 
 My daily routine is stacking chains and hitting licks 
 I use my with stick go get it and stack them chips 
 The haters bumping they lips to try to throw me off 
 But my eyes on the green like I was playing golf 
 I'll never ease up mashing until the day I croak 
 I'll be eighty selling med's to old folks 
 I keep my mind on bread just like a baker 
 My eyes on that paper till I meet my...

 Z-Ro: 
 See I might beat a chick up or should I'da and take the hoe home 
 When you meet a chick you fuckin' the next day, her homies go home 
 But in my crib the type of shenanigans just don't go on 
 Thinking I'm goin' pay to see your pussy, bitch you got me so wrong 
 I might spend a little here, spend a little there 
 Never spend any of it on pussy, I'm a real player 
 Early birds get the worm, I'm up when the cock crows 
 I'm a slip in the baker read 'cause I promise I got doe 
 This ain't pay rent money, this play with money 
 When my friends stop playing with me, I started to play with money 
 My nigga my ass, ain't not one of y'all my nigga no mo' 
 Except for Jimbo, one night he caught me creepin' up out of da bibyo 
 Even though I was down on my luck so he threw me a bone 
 Put money in my pocket, put me in a room and then my nigga was gone 
 Ever since then I been tasting paper like paper murder 
 One of my people have money ain't grown in love of it is evil
