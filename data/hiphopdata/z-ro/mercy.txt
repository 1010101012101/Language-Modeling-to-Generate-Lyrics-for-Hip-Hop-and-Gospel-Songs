Everybody finna die, by the hands of the dark angel of death 
 Snatching up breath, to the depths of your chest 
 How much pain can I manifest? 
 When I come to wreck ripping through your flesh, techs 
 My killers you'll never see, invisible, invisible, are we 
 Unseen like ghosts, strike like infrared beams on toast 
 We smoke the most, but never boast the most 
 Our fingers unleash like ropes around throats 
 Better fear the attack, 'cause we cloak in the image of smoke 
 Leaving motherfuckers broke like a key of dope 
 Mercy, I know not a feeling 
 But the thrilling of the killing gets my adrenaline rushing 
 Never stopping, watching niggas dropping 
 Bone breaking, blood gushing, I done opened the wounds 
 As I destroy cities with typhoons and monsoons 
 Your doom is awaiting, all your mercy's forsaken 
 Time to die, gotta get 'em all 
 Every nigga finna fall when I kill 'em all 
 Found them up and ball some stomach punches 
 Yelling and running, K of dynasty coming 
 Merciless contender, Guerilla Maab member I be 
 It will be an epidemy, hoes wanna get rid of me 
 Finna be found dead and deceased 
 This ain't no game, ain't a damn thing changed 
 'Cause I came to bring the pain 
 Glock ass still fits, running on they head 
 While they bled, I rise up in chains 
 Agony, agony 
 More deadly than anyone's intention 
 It had to be more casualties 
 Rhyming more blemishes of fatal inflictions 
 Slice them up like a Wolverine 
 But I use a machete and a guillotine 
 Hard to stop like Hakeem, I'm a goddamn dream 
 And now mark ass niggas recognize my team 
 Murderer in me, 
 I love to see you bleed 
 (Z-Ro) 
 The murderous feeling is killing your kin 
 And it tripping them niggas out with a .45 
 Hit the ground with a thud in a pot of bubblin blood 
 A bastard finna lose his life 
 Motherfucking nigga from Texas 
 Getting rid of them plexes 
 With a hand full of kicking your ass 
 And everybody better bow down 
 'Cause I fuck around and chow down 
 On a nigga like beef when I'm pissed 
 With a TEC-22, AK-47, 357, Mac 11, pearl, and a 25, 
 Bulletproof vest, and a sharpened shank 
 Motherfucker your body gonna think I'm flawless 
 Swanging and leaving them jawless 
 One of these niggas are about to bleed 
 Runnin' with the big dog, follow my lead 
 Developin' my inner state with weed 
 Put 'em in the streets, I'm a regular competitor 
 To the niggas that don't want to act surely 
 Everybody wanna live, let the early bird get the worm 
 Better pray to God I score my bird early 
 Even though I be hanging with thugs, giving mean mugs 
 And I do a lot of drugs, till I pass out 
 When I smell a dirty rat imma ball 'em my muthafuckin fist 
 I'm hullin' they motherfucking ass out 
 When I be steppin' and pullin' my whip and I'm ready to go to war 
 But them niggas that be steppin' and pullin' 
 They beg when fuckin' around 
 It's going down, load the clip in the gun and I'm making them run 
 A gorilla nigga evermore buckin 'em down 
 But who was the nigga that's talking down on me? 
 Really want me to get an attitude 
 I'm slapping patches up out the niggas 
 That thinkin' my trigger won't be giving no automatic beatdown 
 But that's what I live for, no mercy 
 Walking the land of a wicked world 
 Looking down up on my enemies in vein 
 With a mind full of deadly games and a perfect aim 
 Shooting to kill, putting holes in your frame, feeling no remorse 
 As deadly force overcomes my thoughts, so bare witness 
 To the relentless vengeance, intented for the victims of wickedness 
 Out in the hills of homicide, cause every time I pull a weapon close 
 I can hear the sounds of bodies, falling victim to 17 deadly notes 
 Did you really believe, that you could plot and deceive a nigga like me 
 I was born to murder the world, but killers and G's and evil deeds 
 It'll be a whole lot of flower bringing, psalm singing, 
 If you run up on me the wrong way, I'ma be forced to pull a AK 
 Bust your ass in the head, when the lead spray 
 Bottom line, I'll knock you the fuck out 
 12 gauge in your mouth, ain't no time to shout 
 You been a victim of reincarnated man 
 Guerilla showing no mercy
