I use to be a sucker for love 
 But I'm all right now 
 Ain't nothin' important to me except codeine over ice now 
 I use to be a one woman man 
 But I can't see myself with a wife now 
 Fuck tryin' to please a muthafuka who can't be pleased 
 I'm livin' my life now takin' time out 
 To smell tha roses 
 Livin' life one day at a time 
 A ungrateful bitch will make a brother get on quick 
 I was about to lose my mind 
 Silly me I was thinkin' 4ever 
 Tha bitch was thinkin' about gettin' that chedder 
 But I ain't never been a trick bitch 
 Bottom line you can't get shit bitch 
 Even my baby mama trippin' 
 Bitch gone head and file on me 
 And I really don't give a fuck 
 Jus as long as my child know me 
 What the fuck am I supposed to do 
 Lord I know I need to be closer to 
 You damn right I been slippin 
 'Cause I'm a christain but I ain't livin' like a christian 
 Spend my time with midnight women 
 Seems like every summer I'm in prison 
 No weapon shall form against me shall prosper 
 Keep god as ya man they can't stop ya 
 My grandma told me the pillow don't love you back 
 But god never took one of my ribs and made me a woman I'm a concentrat on my stacks 
 I don't wanna die lonely 
 But them broads I deal with got me still singin' I hate you bitch 
 I don't wanna die lonely 
 But I know 90% of the hoes jus fuck with z-ro tryin' to get rich 
 I don't wanna die lonely 
 I'm in need of a womans touch but in 08 you jus can't trust these hoes 
 I don't wanna die lonely 
 Ain't got no time to play no game I be damn if I let another bitch drive me insane 
 Why should I stress myself when I know I need to be alone 
 What have you done for me lately you ain't got no right to go through my phone woman 
 2 many years I don't paid the price 
 But my days of payin' are gone 
 'Cause I don't love you no more bitch I'm about my money man 
 I would of givin' you the world 
 But now you can't get a got damn not from me man 
 I'm the man I'm the boss I'm tha brother that pays the cost 
 I really do give a damn about joshep 
 If your not him get off 
 What the fuck I sa friend 
 Everybody I see is pretend baby 
 And I'm a grown ass man today 
 But I been callin shots since I was ten baby 
 When I feel like fuckin' 
 I'm a wrap a 100 dolla bill around my dick 
 Even tho I got a life time supply of bow ya head 
 From my nigga j. prince 
 I'm a million dolla playa that's how I carry myself 
 And can't no woman have my heart 'cause I'm a marry myself 
 I don't wanna die lonely 
 But them broads I deal with got me still singin' I hate you bitch 
 I don't wanna die lonely 
 But I know 90% of the hoes jus fuck with z-ro tryin' to get rich 
 I don't wanna die lonely 
 I'm in need of a womans touch but in 08 you jus can't trust these hoes 
 I don't wanna die lonely 
 Ain't got no time to play no game I be damn if I let another bitch drive me insane
