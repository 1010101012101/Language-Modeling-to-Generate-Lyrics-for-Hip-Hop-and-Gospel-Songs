Gorilla Till I Die, mama don't cry when they come for me 
 In my blast we gon' see how many of 'em run from me 
 Gorilla Till I Die, but I never shed a tear 
 'Cause they don't love a nigga here.

 Bam & Z-Ro: 
 American me, could it be my own mob is out to murder me 
 I'm ready to kill & I'm ready to die 
 But have these cowards heard of me 
 The rumors are real, better keep your glock cocked 
 Leavin' 'em stiffer than a statue 
 Ready to defend, my gorilla maab, by any means that I'd murder if I have to. 
 Z-Ro: 
 Could beware my onlys workin' as an undercover 
 Ready to kiss my cheek and earn your silver pieces 
 Could it be that I've seen my last supper 
 Mighty Jehova, please protect my spirit from the danger 
 And I know you said you would strike down upon the 
 With great vengeance and furious anger 
 But don't attempt to poison your brothers 
 Was it nothin' but the word of God 
 That kept a nigga from takin' the lives of so many others 
 And I'm tryin' to keep ways right, But every Mother's Day 
 I'm fallin' around a grave sight 
 Pud-park I hate you to death 
 But yet I loved you so, wanted you to feel my pain since '91 
 So brother come with me and die slow 
 I hate you to death, but yet I loved you so 
 Wanted you to feel my pain since 91 
 So brother come with me and die slow.

 T.A.Z.: 
 As my life flashes before my eyes 
 Visions of wicked ways, keep me puzzled 
 Wonderin' why I was introduced to a life filled with drama and trouble 
 And everyone's always got something to say 
 When I come around, when I clown 
 Armed a deal, smile in my face 
 And stab me in my back, when I turn around 
 And I can feel hateful eyes, watchin' plottin' to get me 
 They under estimate me, hate me 
 But never approach 'cause they can't fade me 
 And I'll be damn if I go softly, shouldn't have crossed me 
 Gorilla Till I Die & I'm a blast when they come for me 
 Lord, please tell me is there a place, where my gorillas could see refuge 
 'Cause it seems this time we gain one, as one more elute 
 Whatever the rules, whatever you choose, whatever you give, I accept 
 Just let me twist up one and smoke one for the world before my last breath. 
 How can I go on? How can I take away my anguish? 
 A permanent frown on my face 'cause now gorillas are strangers 
 And nobody knows my soul, so I show no fear 
 Mobbin' till I die 'cause they don't love a nigga here. 
 Gorilla Till I Die, mama don't cry when they come for me

 Z-Ro: 
 Could it be I'm too good for hell 
 Heaven don't want me, because I keep slippin' 
 Even though I do drugs, I still preach to 
 Muthafuckers about how to be Christians 
 I got a problem I suppose, but I know I'm gon' solve it with a .40 
 10 6 of fry and about 25 tylenol 4 
 But they tell me to hold my head up and finish my tape 
 Because it's gon' jam, do they really respect my music, or hang around Z-Ro just to meet BAM 
 I really don't know 
 All I can say, that I don't trust nobody on this Earth 
 Been that away ever since my birth 
 And it's gotta stay that way till I'm down in this dirt. 
 Nigga, so risen up out of my business 
 Is something they better do, But I my hit the cut 
 Wit a pocket fulla rocks & I won't leave until 
 I got residue, gotta put it down to the bullets 
 Dump alot of bullets & I won't die 
 Till a nigga really wanna kill myself 
 Nigga shut the fuck up, um my record is spinnin' 
 I'm really tryin' to feel myself 
 Gotta get 'em all, gotta get 'em dead 
 When I'm fillin' the bed, put a infrared to the head 
 Everybody come up dead, gotta roll on or get stole on 
 Nigga really better get on, but I just can't hold on 
 'Cause I'm ready to kill & I'm ready to die 
 With nut of steel, livin' on the muthafuckin' edge 
 Nigga don't run up, because it's real. 
 Nigga can you feel me?
