Z-Ro: 
 Too many niggas be tryin' to take me off of my game 
 They see me ballin' so they wanna take me off of my change. 
 Ain't that a bitch? These all broke ass niggas be creepin' my pocket 
 But I'm a soldier y'all can't catch me without my pistol 
 And ain't no PAC in the back, run up on me I'm droppin' you flat 
 My nigga fall behind the trigger, he don't how to act 
 Better tell your niggas to chill while we go round for round 
 'Cause if they trip in Ridgemont dumpin' y'all ain't gon' be around 
 Now kick it with your people and see you cheer and grow up 
 'Cause when you fuck with hard head niggas, your body get dumped 
 3 or 4 counties away, up in a open field 
 On my way back to Mo' City I'm steady smokin' kill 
 So when you see me out in public don't you come at me wrong 
 Disrespect me if you want hoe I'm a slug at your dome 
 Be damn if I miss, but I'm too cool, don't trick yourself bitch 
 Sippin' ball, take this body bag and zip yourself bitch. 
 (Chorus: Z-Ro) 
 Just 'cause you see me out in public, tryin' to keep my cool, keep my cool 
 Don't mean that I ain't a damn fool. I'm a gorilla for real 
 Ain't nothin' studio about me, bitch you 'about to get killed. 
 Cheepin' on doja tryin' to chill, haters fuck up my moves, fuck up my moves 
 God damn that's another dead dude. I'm a gorilla for real 
 Ain't nothin' studio about me, bitch you 'about to get killed. 
 Puff: 
 I'm a gorilla for real, let's roll back to bein' glad 
 When I be ridin' around tryin' to jack 'cause I got pistols in my lap 
 And I'm ready to unload, givin' it everything I got 
 From Rugas to Calico's, even Snug-Nose Glocks 
 So when you see me ridin' nigga don't try to flag me down 
 'Cause when I'm in your face your smilin' when I turn my back you frown 
 So fuck you niggas, I'm already chillin' with enough of niggas 
 Problems with a couple of niggas, don't make me have to bust you niggas 
 Ridgemont till the day I die, visit or deal with it 
 I'm makin' a mill with it, Puff & Z-Ro tryin' to get it 
 'Cause everyday all day bitch havin' blocks steady be pumpin' 
 I got the rear, Ro got the drank and bitch and it be dumpin' 
 So bitch quit all of your bumpin' and come out all of your ice 
 Tryin' to jack a nigga like me, you be comin' off all of your Life 
 Just because you see me flippin' and sippin' smokin' on bud 
 I ain't off no, I got a sawed-off with a barrel full of slugs. 
 (Chorus: Z-Ro) 
 Just 'cause you see me out in public, tryin' to keep my cool, keep my cool 
 Don't mean that I ain't a damn fool. I'm a gorilla for real 
 Ain't nothin' studio about me, bitch you 'about to get killed. 
 Cheepin' on doja tryin' to chill, haters fuck up my moves, fuck up my moves 
 God damn that's another dead dude. I'm a gorilla for real 
 Ain't nothin' studio about me, bitch you 'about to get killed. 
 Z-Ro: 
 Everytime I pop a pill I be full of that bar 
 Hoochies be all up on a nigga, bitch I ain't a star 
 I'm from the ghetto like you come from, probably lived in 
 My Life ain't straight and narrow man, I'm barely dodgin' prison. 
 Ain't you barely dodgin' it too? Ain't you 'about your paper too? 
 Don't glorify me, I do the same shit y'all niggas do 
 I'm not tryin' to be mean my nigga, my temper just bad 
 It's Z-Ro VS. The World in my mind, I'm goin' had 
 Losin' my grip sawed-off bitch, come ride with me 
 You think I roll 'cause when you bust us, you can't ride with me 
 I might get pulled over by the badges, ain't no more room 
 Too many circles in my secret stashes 
 Ridin' 35 tears from 30 and still actin' like I ain't got 
 Runnin' with less fortunates and have-nots 
 It's on my face, no smiles, no frowns, no ups, just downs 
 I pull a piece but I shut it down, nothin' but rounds. 
 (Chorus: Z-Ro] [x2) 
 Just 'cause you see me out in public, tryin' to keep my cool, keep my cool 
 Don't mean that I ain't a damn fool. I'm a gorilla for real 
 Ain't nothin' studio about me, bitch you 'about to get killed. 
 Cheepin' on doja tryin' to chill, haters fuck up my moves, fuck up my moves 
 God damn that's another dead dude. I'm a gorilla for real 
 Ain't nothin' studio about me, bitch you 'about to get killed.
