(Big Moe) 
 Well ain't no plex with the East and the West 
 And plenty drink for your kids and plenty of weed for your chest 
 So leave your pistol at home 'cause we ain't tryin' to go to war 
 The common denominator in the situation is calm like a star 
 You can shine with me 
 Roll on 20's and smoke pine with me 
 C'mon they tryin' to leave you're mine with me 
 Steady be sellin, celebratin', for payin' our dues 
 So much drank in my cup cause the water won't even move 
 As a playa - and associate with the plexin 
 Bone hard click, Monroe City, Texas 
 A veteran don't get me wrong 'cause I'll put you a glass 
 Steady pour you a glass instead of beatin' on your ass! 
 Take a chill pill pill 
 Blow some kill, pop the steal 
 Since we won't be seen 
 Sippin syrup from police 
 From the thirty-third coast it ain't no rush lil G 
 So split your four to the Remi and have a toast degree 
 All I want to do, is bang screw 
 In the dirty-third, the city of syrup, bangin' screw) 
 (Big Moe) 
 Big Moe done stepped in 
 Big Moe done stepped in 
 I done knocked out twins 
 I done knocked out twins 
 Moe - yo comin' down I'm throwed 
 Ballin out of control is Big Moe 
 I'ma let you know 
 I'ma let you know 
 I done let the the four go 
 I done let the the four go 
 And I'ma bout to sip mo than Moe - yo 
 It's Big Moe drank baby 
 I done came down 
 I done came down 
 Up out H-town 
 Up out H-Town 
 And you know I'm a G 
 The M-O-E cocked up on three 
 I'm comin' down threw in my day Moe - yo 
 Screw oh yeah 
 Moe comin' down made that candy wet Moe - yo 
 Said a Moe 
 Big Moe ride down the four 
 Y2K with my headlights on 
 Crossin through the Yellowstone 
 Bout to scoop me a yellow bone 
 Po sex to my stop one 
 Time for me to play my song 
 And they better leave Moe alone 
 In others words just sing the song 
 (Big Moe) 
 In the city of syrup we like to jam music slow 
 Still come up with substance to make them hit the floor 
 84's and vogues with the freshest on my lows 
 Especially on the four doors 
 Bump the straps against the rows 
 Flash low, concert, looking like a lumber yard 
 Waving my trunk up and down the boulevard 
 Charge the platinum card and the Visa to the max! 
 Still won't get no sleep till my click see some cacks 
 Cadillacs and six packs we guys bangin' screw 
 Click click clack clack, get your wimp ass threw 
 Payin' dues and styin true is the rule of the game 
 On top of the food chains 
 Bangin' screw and it won't change for nothin'
