Z-Ro: 
 You got to Get Your Paper in this game 
 If you a hustler, if you a hustler 
 Niggas be playin' with this thing, but you all about your change 
 They can't touch us, they can't touch us 
 24/7 all day handin' business 
 But on the low 5 0 ain't gon' witness it 
 I'm in the alley with them quarters and half's up in my hand 
 Thinkin' of a master plan, I can 
 Hustle all night to the early morn' 
 I can 
 Affect a hustle servin' rappers, serve his dome 
 And if a nigga plottin' on me, I disturb his home 
 And be a straight up fore' they even as I swerve his dome. 
 Get Your Paper hustlin' up in these city streets

 And if you rappin' ain't no handouts in this industry 
 Whatever you can take your time.

 Z-Ro: 
 I used to set up shop 'about 6:00 in the morning on my grind 
 Powder packs and crack and nerve sacks out of the ghetto was on my mind 
 Needed to relocate with the thought of location, keepin' it on the low 
 'Cause when niggas see you all the time it seems they act friends just to get your dough 
 But it ain't no raw to me 
 I ride with the armory, the AR15 
 Collectin' my digits and spinnin' my tires, no time for conversation, I gotta ride 
 Back to my safe place, stash spot for the waste plate 
 'Cause I'm a go getter, if the game escapes ballin' was the picture 'cause there was no hitter 
 Niggas is sinnin' major, nothin' but home runs when I swing my bat 
 But some of these niggas be playin' crooked so I can't forget to bring my ghat 
 But when it's all said and done I'm a redo my walls with platinum placks 
 At the Source Awards, with a grand daddy 
 Couple of drinks, straight like that.

 I'm movin' my units, I'm movin' my heart it's all for stacks man 
 And once I get it, it ain't gon' be no turnin' back 
 Fuck the boomerang affect makin' muthafuckers hate me from a distance 
 Hoppin' fences in an instant 
 Tryin' to get away from the long arm of the law 
 Jeopardize my Benjamin's, I will be forced to put some harm on your jaw 
 My attitude be raisin' it's amazin' I'm not locked for man slaughter 
 Because I love my plastic princess & I can't keep my hands off her 
 She be right next to my nuts every time I deal with hoes and crews 
 Send my bitch to fuckin' suck it bitch, before I know they move. 
 Is that gangster enough for you baby? Ro gotta get his dough bro 
 Bendin' corners in a tinted out 4 do' Volvo blowin' dro hoe.
