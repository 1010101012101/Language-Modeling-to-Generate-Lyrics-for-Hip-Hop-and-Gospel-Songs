Z-Ro: 
 My life is like a crazy game, duckin' and dodgin' crooked cops 
 On a mission fishin' for feddy, ready to make a knot 
 I'm used to havin' less & I just can't deal with the stress 
 And it seems like everywhere I go, another nigga wanna test 
 Brother don't disrespect yourself and get yourself up in a vine 
 'Cause I'm a maniac with a mac & a black backpack 
 Smokin' up on the urban fat sack, I'm tryin' to keep from goin' off 
 But niggas be tryin' to make me starve when I need groceries in my house 
 Wicked niggas say they be friends, but end up tryin' to kill your friends 
 Always turn to foes, that's sayin' it's over millions 
 Dealin' with dirty niggas on a daily basis 
 I Don't really wanna fuck with 'em, but see they baby faces 
 I gotta survive. 
 Let Me Live My Life, nigga don't fuck with me 
 To deal out these deeds, then you die 
 And when it's my time I hope I don't cry. 
 Z-Ro: 
 Livin' in the ghetto, day by day 
 I'm bumpin' tryin' to make a profit 'cause I gotta get my pay 
 You better keep watchin' me and pretty soon, you'll see man 
 That I'm a real rich nigga from the Houston streets 
 Fried out lickin' lookin' for something to eat 
 I'm on a mission, whippin' birds like they stole something 
 Pain, it make me wanna roll something 
 I'm a soldier & I'm outta my mind 
 Voicemail beepin' for days 'cause I'm out on the grind 
 Guess my daddy didn't love me 'cause he turned his back 
 Therefore the streets is my people, a nigga learned like that 
 And I had to get up and bleed the block 
 And it don't stop. 
 Let Me Live My Life, nigga don't fuck with me 
 To deal out these deeds, then you die 
 And when it's my time I hope I don't cry. 
 Z-Ro: 
 My nigga Herman Fisher doin' fed time 
 I remember like it was yesterday, it made the headlines, damn 
 I had to start all over, but it didn't matter 'cause I was a soldier 
 Walkin' around with a king size chip on my shoulder 
 Missin' my mama while I lay down on benches to sleep 
 Snatchin' purses and hoppin' fences just to eat 
 Still I maintain, I'm still in the same game chasin' paper 
 Bitch niggas be up in my business, like oops I'm erasin' haters 
 I'm S.U.C. for life, KMJ until I'm finished 
 Like Popeye from the ghetto, but a nigga don't need no spinach 
 All I need is my Nina when I be flippin' birds 
 'Cause all I have in this world is my balls and my word. 
 Let Me Live My Life, nigga don't fuck with me 
 To deal out these deeds, then you die 
 And when it's mine I hope I don't cry.
