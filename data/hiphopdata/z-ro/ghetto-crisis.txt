(Talking) 
 Brass knuckle knife, Mafia me and my family 
 Jail, hell or paradise, am I my brother's keeper 
 Forever twice, what's done in the dark will 
 Come to the street light, zero tolerance 
 Taking no shorts, it's a ghetto crisis out here 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Who's that peeking in my window, who's that peeking in my window 
 Me drop a miss crop, and vome-vomer, they better recognize 
 Me just uh sit back rolling up me indo 
 I'm another guillotine warrior and the ghetto must survive 
 Stop playa hating, I am the murder you don't know me 
 Another life I'm taking, evil boy when me ra-ta-ta-ta 
 Stop playa hating, I am the murder you don't know me 
 Another life I'm taking, me give 'em a left, me give 'em a right 
 Me start to boxing up their ass 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Syrup in my cup, me straight balling, me balling me balling now 
 Me run up the cut with me gun and dro, nigga come to test me now 
 Me pull the trigger back, look at the boy that's falling him 
 Another day another death, I'll had to murder one, one more grave I am done 
 Stop playa hating, I am the murder you don't know me 
 Another life I'm taking, evil boy when me ra-ta-ta-ta 
 I am the son of Satan, illegal ass a nine killing a man slowly 
 Cruising man or Jamaican, or American can come for test and feel my wrath 
 Is this the way it's suppose to be 
 Dear lord do you hear my prayers are you listening 
 Forgive me for saying I'm trapped in a world 
 That's got a grudge against me living 
 What happened to the good old days when unity was a must, when you 
 Could put trust in your own people, without our own people trying to get us 
 And I could see the rules of the game 
 Are still the same, cause days are shorter 
 And times are harder, I'm fighting to keep my head above water 
 'Cause I got to protect myself from the evil of my own people 
 The only person I fear is God 
 And through his eyes we're all created equal 
 And I can't understand how black on black crime hit as hard as it did 
 Cause the half the niggas that you did you use to roll with as kids 
 Father forgive me for being favorless and hopeless 
 But in this cruel world, it's hard to stay focused if you haven't noticed 
 No one seems to want to follow the rules 
 If we can't live as brothers and sisters than we'll parish as fools 
 And to the youngsters coming up never sell your soul, cause 
 Life is priceless, stay strong and try to make it through this ghetto crisis 
 (Z-Ro) 
 Don't violate me stressed don't cross the line 
 Now I promote no argument me conversate when I won't come nice 
 Paranoid, paranoid, when I be coming on down fawn 
 Ever ball, approach me swinging make a man fall 
 Me serious with the fists one touch could make a fool die 
 Them turned heads and one could see the devil in me eye 
 But I'm off and, and rub the coffin, that's one interrogation 
 Scream heartless when I violate me rule and regulation 
 Me get the satisfaction from the killing 
 Who next for all plex cause me ready and me willing 
 Me ready for the battle, drink a gall wanting the sexual healing 
 Ghetto life is nothing nice we have the cap peeling 
 We are the true jumping and dump and move it over 
 The ghettos all across the line, far from moving over 
 And eye of light, will get me pistol and me pride up 
 Tell me this, who shall save the white man's idol 
 Who shall save the white man's idol (president) 
 Who shall save the white man's idol (national guard) 
 Who shall save the white man's idol (police) 
 Who shall save the white man's idol (priest) 
 Who shall save the white man's idol (dope) 
 Who shall save the white man's idol (them guards too) 
 Who shall save the white man's idol (your soul) 
 Who shall save the white man's idol (God) 
 (Talking) 
 Who gone save your ass when we blast 
 Who gone get the last laugh, coming up out of this ghetto crisis 
 Coming up out of this ghetto gas, uh ha, yeah 
 It's wicked in the mushroom cloud, nuclear niggas 
 It's a ghetto crisis
