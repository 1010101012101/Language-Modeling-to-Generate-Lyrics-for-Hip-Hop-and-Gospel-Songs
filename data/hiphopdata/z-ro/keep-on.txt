Say... 
 Some people call me the crooked cause my mind ain't straight, leave niggas leanin to the side like they need a V8, I tried to be a changed man but my plan ain't play, hatas wants me to put a gun back in my hand and spray, was already dealin' with a bunch of them o hoe ass niggas, hated by mo bitch ass niggas, took a fall, got arrested then you bitches got bold, what you thought I wasn't comin' back to bomb on you hoes, I heard the rumors for myself, Z-ro signed for 10, here I am, it ain't safe to come outside again, 
 Bought a record, fuck everybody, ain't got no friends, nigga remember how you treated Ro when Ro had no ends, that explains when you see me why I reach in my pants, pull out my pistol let it fade niggas straight bleachin they ass, yeah I'm back and let it be known, z-ro done made it home, fuck wit me I empty out my clip, reload and keep-on. 
 Keep on... 
 And I won't stop 
 Fuck wit me, I promise imma make you breathing stop. I keep on, wit my glock cocked, livin' on the edge till I'm dead screamin fuck the cops I keep on and I won't stop, fuck wit me I promise imma make yo breathin stop 
 I keep on, with my glock cocked livin' on the edge till I'm dead screamin fuck the cops 
 Fresh out of jail mayne... 
 You niggas done fucked up now... 
 Came back to get my mail mayne... 
 Playa don't make me buck you down... 
 I'm the king of the ghetto... 
 And I'm here to reclaim my thrown... 
 In a relationship with a tech 4-4... 
 And nigga my bitch be blazin' domes... 
 If y'all fellas wanna play games... 
 Dumpin on every car I see... 
 It's that time when I take aim... 
 Brace yourself... RIP 
 Keep on... 
 And I won't stop 
 Fuck wit me, I promise imma make you breathing stop. I keep on, wit my glock cocked, livin' on the edge till I'm dead screamin fuck the cops I keep on and I won't stop, fuck wit me I promise imma make yo breathin stop 
 I keep on, with my glock cocked livin' on the edge till I'm dead screamin fuck the cops 
 Its reprecussions when you niggas push my buttons to hard and I become a saint by bringing you niggas closer to god love nothin' and slug somethin' every time I breath 
 Murder on my enemys, I'm the reason their familys breath please, OG gorilla Original Girl gone on, before I beat your bitch ass what I did by hanging up my phone, 'cause when niggas get wired up, niggas get tied up 
 It be nothing but yellow tape every time I r-ride up, t-ray, we used to be cool and kick it and thangs, understand you was in prison and missin' the game, understand me when I tell you if you cross me you can die, might as well be a pigeon cause your spirit fitna fly 
 If you wasn't on keep watchin me, you ain't a gorilla, tryna imitate a gangsta, that's when a gangsta come getcha, run and tell your toy soldiers in yo army the war is on, catch 'em one by one and dump my gun and cease to keep on... 
 Keep on... 
 And I won't stop 
 Fuck wit me, I promise imma make you breathing stop. I keep on, wit my glock cocked, livin' on the edge till I'm dead screamin fuck the cops I keep on and I won't stop, fuck wit me I promise imma make yo breathin stop 
 I keep on, with my glock cocked livin' on the edge till I'm dead screamin fuck the cops
