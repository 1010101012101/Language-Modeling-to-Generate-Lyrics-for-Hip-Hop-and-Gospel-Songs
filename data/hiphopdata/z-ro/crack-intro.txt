 Rapping: 
 I try to beat my felony but I lost that case 
 So well, I went to jail and I lost that weight 
 Met a couple dime pieces but I'm true to one woman 
 I could spot a devil with breast when I see one coming 
 What's the matter, y'all acting like y'all mad I'm free 
 Like to see me suffering, is what you glad to see (bitches) 
 Newsflash: I ain't been doing bad in so long 
 Making money in prison like I was still at home 
 Got a few mo vechile, that super size my house 
 Made a call to Paul Wall and he re-did my mouth 
 Know you wonder why I'm the most hated rapper down south 
 I'm so deep they can't reach what I be talking about 
 With the same size foot you couldn't fill these shoes 
 You ain't gotta be a crip for you to dig these blues 
 Where the playa haters at, it's time to hate me again 
 Same pistol, yeah it's dusty without safety again 
 Same snub coll 8 5 7 ain't nothing changed 
 I ain't looking for no trouble just protecting my brain 
 I don't need to reach out and touch ya, stay out of my range 
 If you don't give me a reason, I ain't goin' murder you maan 
 I'm the new Crack, put me on yo hoota and blaze me 
 You ain't even gotta re-smoke, just smoke me daily 
 If ya lookin' for a buzz, this the wrong CD 
 Homie, don't press play, unless you ready to O D 
 All my people love my music, but they don't think I'm a thug 
 Even the kids listen, but they don't think I'm a drug 
 In reality I'm an addiction, but that's a good thang 
 Not on for television, I'm a world wide hood thang 
 Reppin stars, and dealers moving my shit 
 Bootleggers ain't got the good wheel, but it's too hard to call it well 
 And if you got the nerve to call me underground, nigga please 
 Here goes fourteen new songs, overdose on these
