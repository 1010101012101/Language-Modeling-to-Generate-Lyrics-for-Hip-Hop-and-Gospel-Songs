Twenty-four seven I'm in trouble for nothin', 
 To the laws on the topic of the daily discussion 
 Blood pumpin and rushin I gotta struggle to survive I be rappin' but I can't do it a nine to five, long as it be legal I be willin' to try all I need is a pair of wings I be willin' to fly tryin' to get a piece of the pie and they ain't be thinkin' I work for it I be doin' right but I'm being punished on earth for it, what else can I do, to make an honest livin' seem like whatever I do will get me up in prison, never seen me on the corner, never caught me with crack gotta dream of leavin' the ghetto and ain't comin' back, homicide detective tryin' to threaten me with some time, only thing I ever murdered was colla drew lines there's a patent in punishment in America's design, arrested and encarcirated for other peoples crimes it's so amazing 
 Some times, one time, stereotyping, the jury ain't guilty, they swear I've got to be runnin' drugs, but I am, just a man, trying to stay Satan free, to hell is where there taking me, I swear it's so amazing to be a THUG, a True hero under gods sight from above. 
 Everyday I see my people in poverty, and when I say my people I mean everybody I see, ain't no discrimination on Caucasians, or Asian or Mexicans, lesbians or the gay men, everybody gotta day to die and they won't miss it better be ready for company when death come visit, man I wish adam and eve wouldn't have been in the garden, got the devil swinging at me got me weavin and bobbin, homies are bein murdered by lieutenants and seargants, life's weeds were rooted just as soon as we harvest searchin' for sunshine, suffocated by darkness, lookin' for protection in court tippin there fortress, 
 They tell me when I make there'll be no more pain, ain't gotta be nervous about someone knowin' ya name, everybody is your family there's love around you, even on earth god is your upper people down you 
 Have my curse, while on this earth, 'cause I can't find better days, but still I give the lord prays, even though these pirates request my blood, but I am, Just a man, tryin' to stay Satan free, through hell is where there taking me, it's so amazing to be a thug, a true hero under gods sight from above. 
 The weight of my stress is like a 50 ton boulder, making my head heavy can't be lifted by my shoulders, now wonder why my head down, I've been thinkin' to hard I can I can't be smoking my pipe I been drinkin' to hard, I decided to give up and give it to god, instead of livin' in the world imma live in the lord, gave up cussin this time while I'm spittin' my bars, with a vision of me in prison a vision is fraud, investigators cookin the case, they coookin to hard, I know they know I didn't do it 'cause they lookin' for claude, nobody hollin at me got me feelin' like an outlaw, had a case against a brother but I broke it apart, no weapon formed against me share prosperous, it was written, even though machetes be cuttin' and guns be spittin', I got a Satan proof vest on, stompin the devils head off, with Jesus imma stop him that's something you can bet on... amazing...
