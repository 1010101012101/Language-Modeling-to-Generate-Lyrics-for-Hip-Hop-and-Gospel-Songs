(Feat. Pimp C) 
 Pimp C sample of "International Players Anthem": 
 Top Notch Hoes Get The Most Not The Lesser 
 Top Notch Hoes Get The Most Not The Lesser 
 Top Notch Hoes Get The Most Not The Lesser 
 Trash Like The Fuck With 40 Dollars In The Club 
 Top Notch Hoes Get The Most Not The Less 
 Top-Top Notch Hoes Get The Most Not The Less 
 Top-Top Notch Hoes Get The Most Not The Lesser 
 Trash Like The Fuck With 40 Dollars In The Club 
 Verse 1: Z-Ro: 
 I stay in pimp mode, my fifty zip-codes, like pimpin' pen 
 Gotta three hundred Inno prenazo Bentley or Benz 
 I be feeding you chicken dinner it's time for you to win 
 I got room for one more horse in my stable you should come in 
 Trash like the fuck with 40 dollars in the club 
 I be wearing diamonds out here you can't fuck with us 
 I know you wondering what I been doing about but you know what it was 
 Hopping out the dollar signs, we don't need no drugs 
 Top Notch hoes get the most not the lesser 
 ... You goin' end up on the stresser 
 Ghetto Entertainment, Rap-A-Lot, BG and Wrecka 
 I'm a put on mo' money if were together 
 (Hook: Z-Ro and Pimp C) 
 My momma used to tell me 'bout these 
 Really gayed ass bitches in these streets 
 I need direction baby, I'm about protection baby 
 And it's just you and me no need to start investing baby 
 'Cause I don't want'cha body, I want'cha body brane 
 I never been a gigolo baby I'm about that change 
 Catch me in that candy blue thang, and I'm in the turning lane 
 I don't fuck with Reggie Miller with designer doeja burning, man 
 I'm 'bout that Screwston, Texas, most city in my block 
 I be passing every section and I can kick it at any spot 
 We moving behind tent and if the coppers harass 
 Man, I better my mother with J and put my foot back on the gas 
 (Hook: Z-Ro and Pimp C) 
 Sunday morning I'm pulling out my bitch, I'm looking good 
 Nothing but diamonds around my neck and around my wrist I'm looking good (what it is, what it is) 
 Double dressed Tailor made, I'm shaughed down to the flo' 
 And it don't matter if you step on my we-tip shoes, 'cause I'm a just go buy me some mo' (what it is, what it is) 
 Huh, Look homie I'm feeling larger than life 
 That's because I'm able to provide for my daughter tonight 
 I went to sleep on the bitch, but I woke up on the King Size 
 Now everyday of my life I see so many green guys 
 (Hook: Z-Ro and Pimp C)
