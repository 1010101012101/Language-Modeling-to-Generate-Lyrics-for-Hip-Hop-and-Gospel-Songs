Take it from the top, (take it from the top) 
 Let's go out here and roll, on hating ass niggas (let's ride) 
 You can't get your motherfucking weight up 
 So you keep your hate up, (straight up) 
 We gon' show you how it's done man 
 King of the Ghetto and Corleone 
 Screwed up click for life nigga, real talk 
 Fuck you ol' punk ass, strong enough for a man made ass niggas 
 I'm a south side nigga, third ward to be exact 
 Catch me coming down the boulevard, banging Fat Pat 
 You looking at an American gangsta in the flesh 
 Broke bread with true G's, and fronted a few ki's 
 Moved out to Cali, graduated to P-T's 
 O.G. granddaddy, I'm so fooling 
 Tell the truth, DJ Screw made me 
 Without him, y'all wouldn't know Mike D 
 I was just lil' Mike, Bam had a hogg in training 
 Running cars in breeze ways, all day standing 
 While y'all had, y'all hoes on your mind 
 I was posted by the labor pool, rocking for rocking them nines 
 Before and after school, making it pop 
 Yeah a nigga dropped out, but graduated to blocks 
 Had a dream, by twenty-one I'd be a millionaire 
 Few bumps in the road, I'm almost there 
 Either you real, or you fake 
 Cause real niggas don't fold, don't bend or break 
 We just trying to get our cash on nigga 
 And if you disrespect, we'll get our blast on nigga 
 I'm a quiet nigga, but I've got a competitive nature 
 Balling out of control, like number eight from the Lakers 
 I'm Kobe, ain't no other King of the Ghetto I'm the one and only 
 I bet all your nieces and nephews, and cousins know me 
 I rise above the competition, 'cause they're so below me 
 Kinda like what a Geneva watch, is to a Rolly 
 And I know King Johnny, the real King Johnny 
 Those diamonds are not shining homie, you've never seen Johnny 
 Screwed Up Click, soldiers united for cash 
 We legal now, so it ain't no mo' circles in the stash 
 Or circles in the door panel, or circles in the dash 
 Well piss me off and I'll merk you, now you part of the past 
 'Cause I'm an asshole, by nature 
 And I don't love my bitch, I love my paper 
 And you ain't shit, if you ain't never been screwed up 
 But you gon' take a nasty punch, if I lace my shoes up 
 (Repeat: x2) 
 Either you real, or you fake 
 'Cause real niggas don't fold, don't bend or break 
 We just trying to get our cash on nigga 
 And if you disrespect, we'll get our blast on nigga 
 First off nigga, you not my kind 
 Must be deaf dumb and blind, I got blood on mine 
 Me and Ro ain't now playing, skip nan' state 
 Slaved over nan' pot, to take a bite off my plate 
 Ro, I don't know what the hell wrong with these young niggas 
 Got a thousand drug habits, want me to front 'em jiggas 
 Say you're a man, try buying your own 
 So you can quit the silly games, like not answering your phone nigga 
 When you been the King of the Ghetto, fucking with a bitch 
 Know I've been trying to make chicken salad, out of chicken shit 
 Just trying to hit another lick 
 And I hope a snitch ain't there to witness it 
 I'd rather slit my wrists fucking going to jail 
 Where somebody can watch me shit 
 Yes I'm in love with my freedom 
 But I take penitentiary chances just to make sure 
 I never return to wrongest circumstances 
 That's the reason, I'm trying to get my cash on nigga 
 Might even come visit you, with my m√°sk on nigga give it up 
 (Repeat: x2) 
 Either you real, or you fake 
 'Cause real niggas don't fold, don't bend or break 
 We just trying to get our cash on nigga 
 And if you disrespect, we'll get our blast on nigga 
 And there you have it, Screwed Up Click for life 
 And I ain't fooling, Z-Ro the Crooked 
 A.K.A. King of the Ghetto, Mike D A.K.A. the Black Osama 
 It's really going down, Screwed Up Click real talk 
 All my Crip mo'fuckers, throw your sets up 
 All my Blood mo'fuckers, throw your sets up 
 All my four mo'fuckers, throw your sets up 
 All my brown pride niggas, throw your sets up 
 All my Mo City niggas, throw your sets up 
 All my third ward niggas, throw your sets up 
 All my sunny side niggas, throw your sets up 
 All my Hiram-Clarke niggas, throw your sets up 
 All my south-north niggas, throw your sets up 
 All my worldwide niggas, ha
