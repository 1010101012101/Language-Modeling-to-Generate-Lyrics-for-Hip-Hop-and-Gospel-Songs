You better tighten up on your backstroke 
 Trying to fuck around with Z-Ro in the game 
 It's not all about running your mouth all the time 
 It's all about stacking the change 
 Now I don't know if you've been told 
 I make it hot, your ass gonna have to stay indoors 
 'Cause I'm a gangsta, 
 Gangsta 
 Diamond in the back, sun roof top 
 Grill in the front steady making it drop, the bubble grey, all day 
 So when you see me swanging, knocking the belts off the bumper banging 
 It don't stop, and it won't stop 
 I'm your partner, I'm your nigga 
 Went from broke to bigger figgas 
 Not no buster, I'm a real G 
 Even keep us in this rugged penitentiary 
 You know me, Bridgemont four 
 I represent whatever real I couldn't be a hoe 
 What's my name, what's my name 
 Here we go, fanatical radical rhyme flow 
 Started out with a passion for music loving how it go 
 I use to, talk about poverty, talk about crooked cops 
 Talk about grown men raping children it ain't gonn' never stop 
 I'm a spokesman for the ghetto nearest you 
 I'm a Picaso in the this rap game 
 Paint a picture giving you the clearest view 
 24/7, 3-65 I'ma pump, put it to mama 
 I'm a hustler I done said you a camel with no humps 
 Look What You Did To Me was my first CD 
 If it went three final on that I never had a worse CD 
 Guerilla Maab riots, Z-Ro Vs. The World, King Of The Ghetto 
 I done grabbed hold to the rap game and can't let go 
 I'm a feed it to you through the speaker 
 Listen at the highs listen at the mids 
 Everybody loving this even let the old folks listen and the kids 
 Certified ghetto platinum, 'cause I'm a champion 
 But it's for the money, catch it dead if you don't have no fun 
 It's been a long time I've been out on the grind trying to find my way 
 But I can't escape none of the drama, haters jeopardize my day 
 I tried to walk on the straight and narrow 
 And try to stay as sane as I can 
 But I'm just a man, doing all I can 
 Have mercy on me father, I'm guilty 
 But I'm trying harder to do right, do right 
 But when I see my children starving 
 I get gangsta and I start to mobbing 
 It don't stop, and it won't stop
