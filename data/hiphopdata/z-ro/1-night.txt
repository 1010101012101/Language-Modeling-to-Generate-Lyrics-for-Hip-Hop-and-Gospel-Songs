Hey, if only for 1 Nah 
 Night, Night, Night, Night 
 Ah, 1 Night, if only for 1... Night. 
 Z-Ro: 
 I wish I could have my loved ones back 
 'Cause I'd love to have my loved ones back. 
 If only for 1 Night. 
 Trae: 
 We don't have to feel it like that 
 'Cause I hate to see the pain comin' back. 
 Z-Ro: 
 If only for 1 Night. 
 Nobody get killed on the block 
 No reason to pack the steel on the block. 
 If only for 1 Night. 
 Trae: 
 We can get to make it to the top 
 And see my dawgs make it out the cell block. 
 Z-Ro: 
 If only for 1 Night. 
 Maintainin' there'll be no more complainin' 
 It's all right. If only for 1 Night 
 Maintainin' tryin' to keep it from rainin' 
 It's all right. 
 I love you. 
 Trae: 
 I swear, deep down I be sinkin' 
 The same things over and over they never get better 
 I miss my niggas, rain fallin' 
 9 times out of 10 it don't miss my nigga 
 Damn, I hope this state of mind'll never leave again 
 I wanna see my nigga Screw get to breathe again 
 And wanna see Dinky and my nigga Donny break free again 
 On the block, never thinkin' 'about Plex 
 24 years of mine I've been blessed 
 Dawg, don't you get it twisted 
 'Cause 19 years of those have been stressed 
 Never thought that I'd see this time 
 And it ain't no way that I'm a let it get by 
 Ain't no lie, deep down inside 
 Just to hold it close it wanna make me cry 
 No more' drama, like no laws 
 No more' jail, no more collect calls 
 No more' hate from these roach ass niggas 
 And my dawgs on the block'll ball till we fall 
 Plus Peewee would've never got locked 
 Plus Greedo would've never got shot 
 Plus Mello would've still been here 
 With a white Kango about to body rock the pen 
 Misty, then the rest of the click like 
 Full speed than runnin' without a red light 
 Whole life I'll be one of a kind 
 Go deep in the wind I promise I got my head right 
 And I hate it's gon' be like this 
 I wonder why everything come to me like this 
 And if only for 1 Night I finally get my smile 
 Lord, I don't wanna leave like this. 
 I love you. 
 Z-Ro: 
 I wish I could have my loved ones back 
 'Cause I'd love to have my loved ones back. 
 If only for 1 Night.

 I love you. 
 Z-Ro: 
 It'll be nice to have Emo and Jody and LL back 
 My nigga Best and his big brother E Roy Love 
 Them people ain't never comin' back 
 But if only for 1 Night 
 My nigga could make a decision he should've made 
 Make it where the situation turned out another way 
 And ain't a day go by 
 I don't wish I didn't have to miss my mama 
 This ain't livin' my nigga this just drama 
 If only for the night when the storm'll live calmer 
 'Cause seem like they wanna give a lifetime sentence 
 To a nigga with a pistol & a pound of marijuana 
 Wish it was legal to be in public wit your eyes red 
 I've seen a lot of B.I. cases go fed 
 Got pulled over, no seat belt on the shoulder 
 Led to a 70 year stand and colder 
 If only for the dead nigga 
 Didn't have to wait to make a safe walk to the store 
 Just to get his niggas & a 6 pack I'm strapped 
 But there never been a cakewalk to the store 
 Fuck around and see the head concussion 
 If the hood decide you gotta fake walk to the store 
 They fully fronted to everybody with animosity 
 Bitches'll take 'em off 'fore they walk to the store 
 A nigga from the Southside & a nigga from the Northside 
 And a nigga from the Eastside 
 Could all get along with each other, like we knew each other mother 
 No reason to wanna take our own lives 
 By losin' a son, losin' a daughter, losin' a child 
 I'm battered by life, too rude to smile 
 I like it better when I used to smile 
 If only for 1 more Night. 
 I love you.
