(*Talking*) 
 Shit, Z-Ro the Crooked, I know y'all been waitin' on this here, yep, shit. 
 R.I.P. Big Mello, Screw, Mafio, Big Boo, Gator. 
 All the fallen soldiers man. 
 Southside, Eastside, Westside, Northside. You know what I'm sayin'? 
 All my partners, all your dead partners 
 But shit I still feel stress, I still gotta get something off my chest 
 While these hoe niggas be doin' what they be doin' 
 I don't know though, shit fuck it 
 We gon' stay 2 deep in a fo' do'. 
 Z-Ro: 
 Slow Loud and Bangin' all in my trunk 
 Trunk full of funk, I ain't never been a punk 
 I blow on skunk, I blow on doja 
 Military minded, I'm a muthafuckin' soldier 
 Out the streets of the Ridgemont 4 
 Not no bitch and say I still ain't a hoe 
 Lettin' niggas know everyday of the year 
 I pimp my pen & I get my point clear. 
 Why niggas wanna talk down? I don't know 
 Gotta take a trip to Akapoko from the 4 
 With my .44 on my side when I ride 
 Ready to do another homicide in a pine box 
 And I'm gone, nigga old glory 
 I'm H-Town to Cali just like Robert Horry 
 If I do a murder flee the murder scene 
 No missin' shortage on the drank, I can't find no lean 
 From Southwest to Southfese, bitch it's about war not 'about peace 
 Nigga like me, I'm 'about knockin' out teeth. 
 You know what I'm sayin'? I'll loose your grill 
 A nigga comin' down in the Coupe Deville 
 Lookin' gravy, lookin' real throwed 
 I'm a be the nigga pullin' over at the fucking cross road 
 With my K on my side, I'm ready to ride 
 And if I gotta go it'll be a homicide 
 Me and another nigga on the way to the Golden Gate 
 A nigga like me can't wait just to make it to another day 
 Gotta get the big pay off, so get the fuck out my way 
 When I come around your corner so slow 
 It'll be the nigga in the damn Polo 
 That's the Ralph Lauren, jackers ain't barrin' 
 Why I skipped the slab when I went straight to foreign 
 Said it like I said it in the old school 
 Some niggas they be red but Z-Ro blue 
 I come around your corner but I ain't set trippin' 
 But I will wet niggas and wet bitches 
 With the calico, I had to let a muthafucker know 
 That I come around your corner in a Lincoln 4 do' 
 A fox photo 'cause I do it in a flash 
 Nigga watch out 'cause that could be your ass 
 I rhyme so long, rhyme so strong 
 I flicks my bar sip then I swoll on 
 Get on the muthafuckin' bench 
 And when the laws hit the corner I hit the fence 
 They wonder where I went, they keep lookin' 
 I don't give a fuck like Tyson I keep hookin' 
 Or maybe like Lenox, I'm strong to the finish 
 I'm like the ghetto Popeye, but I don't need spinach 
 I'm a keep goin' I keep on flowin' just like the Nile 
 Million dollar mouthpiece every time I smile 
 Look and load a nigga ashtray 
 Everytime he smile he can turn the night to day 
 You can open up the pop and let the smoke come out 
 We don't give a damn 'about a crooked ass cop 
 Crooked officer, crooked officer 
 Make a nigga wanna blow the badge off of ya 
 Me and Dougie, my muthafuckin' brother 
 R.I.P. to my muh'fuckin' mother 
 That's the Dorothy Marie McVey Matthew 
 There's 10 toes planted in my muh'fuckin' shoe 
 I gotta be a man, I hope you understand 
 There's nothin' but the work and the calico in my hand 
 On a corner on the Ridgevan & I'm servin' a fiend 
 A real live B-Boy and you know what I mean 
 I be stackin' up chips like Lego 
 Dark on a pump just like Calvin Kato 
 Houston to the Rocket, a 4 peat like Comets 
 I don't give a fuck, good punch a bitch nigga make him vomit 
 On the grind, I'm a take a trip on Greyhound 
 I be flyin' on a plane but the dope is on the ground 
 Headed to Lake Charles or headed to Lafayette 
 Maybe off in Alexandria but I ain't finished yet 
 I gotta make a hoe I-10, I sin 
 Then I do it again 
 I get my ends, I'm in my muthafuckin' Benz-y 
 Got these hoes runnin' around in a friends-y 
 I be bustin' full clips till they empty 
 A piece of potent pussy might tempt me 
 Rain is tryin' to send me to the Penitentiary 
 The main reason why I ain't friendy 
 I'm wired up, but I ain't on no damn slaughter 
 Dejaun in the back and he got the camcorder 
 Recordin' everything the 4's gon' swang 
 Still pullin' up on Fondren and the Main 
 Lookin' lovely, got to look good 
 I throw up Ridgemont 4 'cause that's my hood 
 Never been a hoe, I'm lettin' hoes know 
 I gotta get a fuckin' P L A T, but first a G O L D 
 A muthafuckin' plack 
 I keep it straight and simple like that, hit a bitch from the back 
 And I use my muthafuckin' tool 
 Make her say atch, when I hit a with The Mule.
