Z-Ro: 
 They tell me put the dole down and it won't hurt no more 
 But the only thing I really seem to understand is murder more 
 They tell me keep my trigger finger easy, I'll open up your body 
 Too many casualties around here, dead bodies around here 
 And I can't get caught up, preacher can you save me, save me. 
 They said it was gonna get greater later 
 But now I can't help to think that it ain't 
 But a nigga was fed up with this life, thinkin' about runnin' a razor blade 
 Cross my wrist, every last drop till I faint 
 Taken out there, pullin' smith for the things that I never did 
 Comin' up as a a young kid 
 Tryin' to get rid of all the animosity towards me that was shown by the other kids. 
 What did I do wrong? Why do everybody wanna see a nigga fall? 
 Mama dead and Daddy can't be found. 
 So when I'm stressed out, who the fuck can I call? 
 All alone in my own zone, with no friends 
 So I chose to make friends with drugs 
 'Cause everyday everybody around me 
 Tryin' to clown me, so I got afraid & I got buzzed 
 Out of frustration came aggravation 
 Depression comin' down in my mind 
 Kept a nigga confused and straight cryin' 
 Dyin' from sweet sticks in line 
 Throwed off in the mind 
 Tryin' to wonder why do Jesus let this keep happenin' to a nigga that's steady bein' on his knees 
 And I'm beggin' you please, have mercy on me 
 Find a nigga a better way, right about now I'm to the point 
 Somebody better take this infrared away 
 'Cause if it go too long & I got a piece of chrome 
 And I want to you to come and look and see the monster that you've created 
 Look at What You Did To Me. 
 Z-Ro: 
 They tell me all the liquor ain't good for me 
 But it drowns out the vision of my casket 
 It's either my life or your life, that's right 
 I'm gon' let you have it 
 Everyday haters, can't understand 
 The way I move my hands in ways, not known to man 
 'Cause I can't get caught up 
 Preacher can you save me, save me. 
 Z-Ro: 
 Could it be the invisible, individual nigga that got to get more bigger 
 Got a hell of a one hitter quitter knock out, bigger 
 Muthafucker got more skills with a trigger 
 Shootin' scud missiles, droppin' a bomb 
 Chuckin' hand grenades, C4's explode 
 When I be sleepin' on the same bench for 9 days 
 Livin' off of hot water and cheerios 
 Here it goes, my click back gotta roll 
 Nigga mind was thinkin' throwed. 
 A 24 fists apposed to those 
 They actin' like nothin' but bitches and hoes 
 Suppose, all a nigga wanted was the good life 
 Live in upper class, laid back on my ass with a maid & a butler 
 Sippin' on a ice cold glass 
 God damn it, I'm a do it but I had to start introducin' 'em' to mac 9 plus one that's 10 
 Better think many murders would have been avoided 
 I just wanted a friend, feel me 
 But they can't kill me, but I don't give a fuck if I bust with a gun 'cause I don't give a damn no more 
 You ain't dealin' with the same muthafucker from 3 years ago 
 Will a nigga fight fair, knockin' out a patch out your hair 
 With a quick lick, from a damn breakin' a nigga done went crazy 
 Look at what civilization done made me 
 This is my era of terror, I am the man with the gun that admitted never to miss, would've ever miss 
 When it be bustin' alot of you gonna be rushin' 
 'Cause a nigga war like this 
 Innocent child with a smile with a dreams of advanced 
 To the top, but I got a gun in your mouth 
 You want to respect me now, should've respected a nigga when you had a chance 
 Haters, been makin' me into a punk tryin' to figure me weak 
 Better get ready fore' them put zip-locs 
 And a whole of cops & a whole lot of blood stained 
 Sheets, drunk alot of beers, shed a bunch of tears 
 When I reminisce on them years, when I see little boys and girls livin' the life that I wanted to live 
 Since I really couldn't live with it 
 It's gonna be hard for the other muthafuckers to try 
 'Cause they dyin' hey mama 
 I want my Tunker toys right now 
 Don't make me cry, I don't wanna have to kill again 
 I kill 'em out till the world is empty 
 Look at the the album cover 
 That's what you did to me. 
 (*Talking*) 
 If I done told you once 
 I done told you a thousand times 
 It's plain to see that you can't change me, nigga 
 'Cause I'm a forever be a nigga for life 
 A thug nigga, a Gorilla Maab nigga 
 A Killer Klan nigga, a Mo' City nigga 
 Mo' City means more killers, more blood spillers 
 More burglars, more murderers 
 More kick door burglars 
 More niggas that'll slap a patch out your muthafuckin' ass 
 For real, count on it, respect it 
 Trust it and believe it, we ain't no fake ass niggas we real, packin' loaded steel 
 Ready to bust at will, we don't love you 
 Look at What You Did To Me.
