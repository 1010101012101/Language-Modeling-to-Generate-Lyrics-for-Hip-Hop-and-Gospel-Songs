Uh-oh y'all muthafuckers done fucked up now 
 Z-ro the crooked muthafucking moe city don 
 Yeah nigga I done hooked up with rap alot 
 Know what I'm saying 
 I know y'all don't like that 
 Fuck y'all 
 The mansions, the hummer, the bentley I want it all 
 Like every other nigga that's 26 I wanna ball 
 That's why I get up off my rump and I go and get it 
 So when my pockets looking low time to pay the suburb a visit 
 I can't see myself at the bottom of the food chain 
 When a nigga hungry and broke I go through some mood swings 
 Lay it down muthafucker I got kids to feed 
 I was on the block and z-ro need the speed 
 Do I suffer from greed I gotta get some cash quick 
 'Cause I look back on my life a nigga ain't never had shit 
 50 packets get me through the night 
 Y'all would've kept chopping 
 Quarter ounces keepin' fiends geeking 
 And stuffing weed sacks like pillows 
 I eat on the block I sleep on the block then I retreat on the block 
 Caught up in this game of chasing dough 
 I'm not mamas little boy no more 
 Everytime you see me in public I'm on my grind 
 It started out just trying to get fed 
 I gotta get up and go get this bread 
 And the ? of 50 million I'm about to lose my head
