I hate you bitch (x3) 
 I never thought I'd say. 
 I hate you bitch (x3) 
 I never thought I'd say 
 Too many years I done paid the price 
 Why you gotta put all this drama in my life 
 Day after day I'm on the grind for you 
 Livin' lavish, drape you in carats is what I'm trying to do 
 But I am just a man 
 Trying to do all I can 
 But you act like you can't understand 
 Well I done sacrificed and I done swallowed my pride 
 On the wrong road, trying to follow my pride 
 I was daddy for a while, though I've got no seed 
 But the kids are my H-E-A-R-T 
 I've been dealin' with a lot, so I've been loosin my mind 
 Straight up acting before I think, daddy using my mind 
 My freedom is on the line and my sanity's gone 
 You picked a fine time to leave me, now this house ain't a home 
 I had no problem being faithful; I love you so much I hate you 
 Because you left when I needed you the most 
 So now a bitch is how I rate you 
 My female friends making you wonder 
 Guilt got you feelin' suspicious 
 From when you was creepin' on me on the under 
 But even still I held my head 
 Five kids and I fed them all with board, bread and spread 
 Them was my muthafuckaz 
 Treated them like sistaz and brothaz 
 But somehow fell out of place 
 Fuckin' with they punk ass mother 
 I apologize 
 I wish I could turn back the hands of time 
 Wishin we could pillow fight, just one more time 
 But Miss Rhonda wanna put them laws in my life 
 Although I'm happy I never picked you not at all in my life 
 Solo is how I'll kick it the rest of my days 
 But I want to thank you for makin' possible, 
 Some of the best of my days 
 I've dried my eyes now 
 And now all they can see is the green 
 You can have that jewelry broke ass mothafucka 
 Just let me sing. 
 I hate you bitch (x3) 
 I never thought I'd say. 
 I hate you bitch (x3) 
 I never thought I'd say
