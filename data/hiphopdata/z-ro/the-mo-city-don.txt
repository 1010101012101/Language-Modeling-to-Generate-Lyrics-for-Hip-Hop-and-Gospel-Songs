K.I.N.G. THe Mo City Don 
 I Know You Heard About Me and This Mission I'm On 
 Not an R.A.T, I'm Just Trying to live on, Not in a Penententary I\'d Rather be rollin' chrome, In the P.E.N.T. my attitude was shown, kuz I've never been friendly, you should leave me alone, but if I S-L-I-P and my brains get blown just listen at my CD 'cause I live in my songs 
 I'm just living my life 
 Not worried 'bout no money or no women tonight, just rollin' in something foreign with my gun at my side, smoking designer dogia hope I don't run into one time, No perticular destination I jus wanna roll, Don't wanna talk I left all of my cell phones at home, All I need is 15 pounds of leave me alone, kuz ain't nobody on this level I'm on (HA HA) 
 All I see is murda murda my mind stable 
 Preoccupied with homicide, trying to survive through this crime rate, most of my homies hustle for big bucks, but blow it on bullshit then start complaining about how they can't come up, association bringss about simulation, you know what that means? able to feen and you too will be a dope fiend, the same thing goes for crooks and thieves, when I'm not getting arrested by the law I'm out gettin' my cheese

 So take yo gin and hypnotic and have a seat by the pole, instead of killin' yo ass i\'d rather po\' you a glass, I'm tired of bein the reason people under the grass, but I won't lose people who will murder yo ass, couldn\'t keep yo ghetto past, homie when I tell you I'm unjackable I ain't just talkin' shit, I got gorillas everywhere be careful who you walking with, but I'm an equal opportunity lender, I'm not a slob, meet me in mo city and I might just give you a job (HA HA) 
 Kuz I'm lookin' for a few good men 
 Trying to expand my operation, been local long enough time to go nation, 
 Making a transition from the streets to the fame, a couple clubs, gas stations and hotels in my name

 Uh I can do bad one deep 
 I wish I could flip in a bentley coupe with just one seat, ... cigarillo with just one freak, and if I fall off before I ask for help, ill eat lunchmeat, wear my pride on my shoulders and my heart on my sleeves, with knowledge and understanding that's 360 degrees, 95 to 5 P-E-R-C-E-N-T, only a few real niggas plus so many walk with me, hell yeah I wear the holy corona in the good book, until the investigators give the clues a good look, and the king don't have to wear his crown to rule, that's what the book says that without common sense yous a damn fool
