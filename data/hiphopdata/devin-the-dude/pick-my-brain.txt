Aw mayne, motherfuckers think I've changed

 And a coupla bitches wanna lick my thang 
 Aw mayne, motherfuckers think I've changed 
 I'm just tryin' to chill, that ain't why I came 
 Now I got these niggas tryin' to pick my brain 
 And a coupla bitches wanna lick my thang 
 Up in the scene with some green in my jeans 
 Me and my team made of most of weed things 
 Just leaving the lab, 'bout to have 
 Bust a drink, find some pink and hope it don't stink 
 I go out hardly but when I chill at a party 
 I just be glad to see everybody 
 Having a good time as we chill and reminisce 
 Get on the flow and bust a move, remember this? 
 As I see the ladies ringing while the DJ is spinning 
 'Bout to pounce up on some pussy, ain't finna pay a penny 
 Excuse me miss, baby you looking good, I wish we could 
 Get to know each other 
 Aw mayne, motherfuckers think I've changed 
 I'm just tryin' to chill, that ain't why I came 
 Now I got these niggas tryin' to pick my brain 
 And a coupla bitches wanna lick my thang 
 Aw mayne, motherfuckers think I've changed

 Now I got these niggas tryin' to pick my brain 
 And a coupla bitches wanna lick my thang 
 That nigga bustin' me and talkin' 'bout publishing 
 When that ain't the conversation we're discussing 
 When we got a group of bitches over there in the mix 
 Lookin' oh so fine with their hair fixed 
 I don't know right now how much will I charge for a verse 
 But I do know that my dick is so hard that it hurts 
 Lookin' at that bitch over there, excuse me mayne 
 Let me spit my game, hopefully she'll lick my thang 
 Oh that nigga trippin', that nigga think he that 
 That nigga think he this, hey nigga ain't 'bout shit 
 Man he ain't gon' help a brother out in need 
 All that nigga wanna do is fuck hoes and smoke weed 
 Mayne, you know I'm tryin' to come up and tryin' to do mines 
 And that nigga there he ain't got time 
 We got sweets, got freaks, got joints and shits 
 I won't talk about no mothafuckin' points and splits 
 Aw mayne, motherfuckers think I've changed 
 I'm just tryin' to chill, that ain't why I came 
 Now I got these niggas tryin' to pick my brain 
 And a coupla bitches wanna lick my thang 
 Aw mayne, motherfuckers think I've changed

 Now I got these niggas tryin' to pick my brain 
 And a coupla bitches wanna lick my thang 
 We talkin' and we jokin', 'bout to spark it, finna smoke it 
 Man, my dick I'm tryin' to poke it in the broad 
 When I leave, it's kinda difficult 
 To do it with you slobbin' on my sleeve 
 Nigga please hit the weed and chill fo' a sec 
 What are the chances of you getting the deal fo' I jet? 
 With all due respect I understand your hustle 
 But I'm tryin' to get one-a-deez hoes to hug my love muscle
