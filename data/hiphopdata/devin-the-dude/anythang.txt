 Anythang is plenty man 
 You ain't the only one who got problems 
 You ain't the only one who knows pain 
 Get up off your ass and just solve it 
 You still got a chance to try to change - try this shit again 
 Really ain't no need for self pity 
 Cryin when there's no one else around 
 Life I know sometimes can get shitty 
 Even shittier when sleepin' on the ground - no need to complain 
 You ain't the only one who got problems 
 You ain't the only one who knows pain 
 Get up off your ass and just solve it

 Really ain't no need for self pity 
 Cryin when there's no one else around 
 Life I know sometimes can get shitty 
 Even shittier when sleepin' on the ground - no need to complain 
 Notihin at all - nothin' at all - anything is plenty man 
 I hope you realize that everybody gonna need somebody sometime 
 Anythang is plenty man and is better than an' nothin' at all
