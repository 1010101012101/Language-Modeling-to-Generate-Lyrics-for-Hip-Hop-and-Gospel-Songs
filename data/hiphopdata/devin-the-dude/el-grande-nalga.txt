Tu esta mue bonita 
 Hey baby, you sho' look mighty fine when you walk my way 
 Say lady, I sho' wish there was something I could say 
 That booty I truly wish that I could speak your language 
 'Cause I really don't know how to explain it 
 Ooh bonita, tu tiene's el grande nalgas 
 Ooh bonita, tu tiene's el grande nalgas 
 So mannish the thoughts that goes and stops inside my head 
 My Spanish is so bad, I don't know what the fuck I said 
 Excuse me, senorita, I'm jus tryin' to find the words 
 To let you know I like the way your booty curves 
 Ooh bonita, tu tiene's el grande nalgas 
 Ooh bonita, tu tiene's el grande nalgas 
 Ooh bonita, tu tiene's el grande nalgas 
 Ooh bonita, tu tiene's el grande nalgas 
 So authentic the way you move those hips when the music plays 
 All off in it I'll groove if I could be with you today 
 No comprende is all I get when I ask you to dance 
 I really wanna feel what's in them pants, girl 
 Ooh bonita, tu tiene's el grande nalgas 
 (Ay, ya, ya, you do, baby) 
 Ooh bonita, tu tiene's el grande nalgas
