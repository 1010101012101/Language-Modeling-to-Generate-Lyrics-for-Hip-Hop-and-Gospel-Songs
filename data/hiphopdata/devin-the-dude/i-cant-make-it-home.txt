One blunt, one more shot of patron 
 I'm lit, I can't make it home 
 Cops right behind me, I might be gone 
 I can't make it home

 I know I just left your crib but I'm 'bout to make the block and come back 
 It's too hot over here, matter of fact police behind me right now and shit 
 I'm kinda' bent, I'm glad I got tint 
 Damn, I hope they don't try to tow my shit 
 I should've chilled, though, no, them patron shots 
 See, I drink Crown Royal, that's my drink, know what I'm talkin' about? 
 But nevertheless, I gotta stay between the lines 
 'Cause if I trip, then I dip, then if I swerve one more time they gonna be 
 On my ass like white on rice like shit on grass 
 So I grab what I have and stash it 
 I got the time for no harassment 
 Aww, shit, aww, damn baby, I'll have to call you back 
 Yeah, they're pullin' me over 
 Excuse me sir, you sober?

 Yeah, they got me, he tried to pull me out the car 
 I had to resist, he almost shot me but I'm cool 
 He found a blunt, it wasn't burnin' but he smelled it and he checked it 
 I had a warrant in East Texas 
 So I was cuffed and stuffed in the back of the car 
 He didn't report the cigar I guess he thought I was a star 
 But we drove real far fo' about 6 hours 
 I really had to piss, my wrist no longer had power 
 Couldn't even take a shower surrounded by niggas 
 I'll only be there a couple of hours, I figured 
 As far as the weed, I think he kept it and he smoked it 
 But he got me on a DUI and I'm on some broke shit 
 So I'mma need you to go down to the bail bondsman y'know 
 Try to come up with a few funds 
 And hurry up and run down here and get me outta this one 
 Hello?
