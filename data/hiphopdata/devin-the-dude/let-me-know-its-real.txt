I want something that I can get into 
 Gimme something I can touch and feel 
 I need something to let me know it's real 
 I want something that I can get into 
 Gimme something I can touch and feel 
 I need something to let me know it's real 
 We've been knowing each other for quite a while yet we just start dating 
 You know, I wanna slide inside but you got me waiting 
 So I'm skating to the side, no longer can I provide 
 For someone who try to hide what's between them thighs 
 And right now I know, you're horny and I'm lonely myself 
 Don't cheat me, treat me, beating my meat ain't that good for my health 
 So no choice left but to leave and try to fuck a freak 
 That'll suck a meat, don't wanna kiss and still brush her teeth 
 I got respect but my dick get out of pocket 
 See a fine bitch, fuck her, yep, I got her 
 'Cause I must get mine, you try to get yours 
 And I see through them counterfeit whores 
 That certain niggas choose now, they wish they wouldn't had 
 'Cause they abuse a nigga, use a nigga, do a nigga bad 
 And they gone like a target through the cone 
 And I don't like being alone, I want 
 I want something that I can get into 
 Gimme something I can touch and feel 
 I need something to let me know it's real 
 I want something that I can get into 
 Gimme something I can touch and feel 
 I need something to let me know it's real 
 Now understand I'm just a man, no higher, I have desires 
 If I say I didn't want no pussy I would be a liar 
 But that's not it, for me pussy's easy to get 
 But I would bet yours is the perfect fit 
 I know it's soft and wet 
 Warm and wide, wantin' this bone inside 
 'Cause you have needs too 
 We can satisfy each other, just me and you 
 And I wouldn't have to linger putting my finger up in some other cat 
 Feelin' secure, knowin' exactly where my lover at 
 When I come back it's in the bedroom purrin' 
 Find the both, put my spoon in and start stirrin' 
 And fill you up from the bottom to the top and 
 Ain't no stoppin' after panties droppin' 
 Your mind is on shopping, mine is on fucking 
 'Cause nothing from nothing leaves nothing and 
 I want something that I can get into 
 Gimme something I can touch and feel 
 I need something to let me know it's real 
 I want something that I can get into 
 Gimme something I can touch and feel 
 I need something to let me know it's real 
 And I've been very patient, been waiting and conversating 
 But all this hesitation kinda got me contemplating 
 Wanna ask you, how come you refuse to give it to me 
 For these last three albums, I've been tryin' to get the pussy 
 I'm not tryin' to run game, trick you or double dare ya 
 If I take off my draws don't let these big nuts scare ya 
 I've been thinking I can make ya ooh and moan 
 Let me know if you do or you don't 'cause I want 
 I want something that I can get into 
 Gimme something I can touch and feel 
 I need something to let me know it's real 
 I want something that I can get into 
 Gimme something I can touch and feel 
 I need something to let me know it's real
