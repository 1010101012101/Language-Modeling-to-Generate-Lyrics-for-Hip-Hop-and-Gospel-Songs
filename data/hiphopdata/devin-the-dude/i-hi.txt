I was reminiscing in the kitchen, drinkin', thinkin' 'bout the past 
 Lookin' for some records just diggin in the trash 
 Searching for something to ease a young little mind 
 Other little kids they run up on me from behind 
 They was laughin' and pointin, callin me out by my name 
 You nasty little nigga boy you need to be ashamed 
 I had no vinyl but I knew they knew where I live 
 They followed me and bothered me all the way to the crib, saying 
 I-hi, i-hi 
 I-hi, i-hiia 
 I ran up in my room, took a look through my stack 
 Some of them where kool some were crick and some were cracked 
 Created a way to play em, my technique was so live 
 A nickel on a head to heel that scratched 45 
 A lot of warped LP's look at how they swerve 
 Do you know what you listenin to? it's some shit you never heard 
 We was dancing, swingin', movin to the groove 
 But it's kinda hard to party when they pointin at my shoes, sayin' 
 (Men talking) 
 -- Did it again! 
 -- Yes you did motherfucker. I saw that. Everybody saw that, you fucked up 
 It's still the same, ain't shit really changed 
 Some people gonna complain 
 If you're grown, just go on and do your thing 
 Either rap or sing, or just dance or chill 
 Take a chance if you will, try to enjoy every day 
 When you're at work with no play 
 Cause either way somebody's gonna say
