The briar patch 
 No don't throw me in the briar patch 
 You can cut off all my toes, but not the briar patch 
 You can fill me full of holes, but not the briar patch 
 Don't throw me in the briar patch 
 Don't throw me in the briar patch 
 Please don't put me in the briar patch 
 You can season and cook me, but not the briar patch 
 For me, no one would ever look off in the briar patch 
 Don't throw me in the briar patch 
 Don't throw me in the briar patch 
 I hop, I jump, I skip through the rubble 
 Yo, we ain't lookin' for trouble 
 I's just tryin' to get to the other end, I never been 
 Maybe then I can tell my friends how it is, I been 
 Searching for someone to help me, maybe you can 
 But its hard to tell you how I feel when you got a knife in ya hand 
 You can carve me 
 Tie me up and starve me 
 Put me on the grill, still nothing can harm me 
 Like the briar patch 
 Don't chunk me in 
 What kind of luck would I have then 
 Wait a minute man, before you put me in it, use the gun 
 Let you got a couple of bullets I'll be finished done 
 Or hey, I can help you find a pot 
 Help you build a fire, help you get it good and hot 
 Well unless, you like to eat me cold 
 You can but oh no please don't throw me in 
 The briar patch 
 No don't throw me in the briar patch 
 You can cut off all my toes, but not the briar patch 
 You can fill me full of holes, but not the briar patch 
 Don't throw me in the briar patch 
 Don't throw me in the briar patch 
 Please don't put me in the briar patch 
 You can season and cook me, but not the briar patch 
 For me, no one would ever look off in the briar patch 
 Don't throw me in the briar patch 
 Don't throw me in the briar patch 
 Don't throw me in 
 You's an ugly motherfucker, dog, I just call it like I see it 
 And your breath is like death, and if you don't like it so be it 
 I get mistreated by others if you cut above me your not 
 Slice off my toes 
 If that's how it goes 
 I really don't give a fuck 
 If all of this belongs to you 
 Do what you do, go head 
 But throw me in the briar's patch 
 And you'll never see so much red 
 I bled from Destin just tresspassing 
 'Cause I'm just askin for a favor 
 Excuse my rude behavior 
 I'm just trying to savor the flavor of the fruit I just picked 
 And if you don't like it, you can suck my dick 
 But what you don't do 
 Is throw me in the briar patch and then I'm through 
 Come on man, can't we call a truce can we do somethin' about it 
 Before people end up crying and shoutin and poutin 
 Man, come on man, that would really hurt our friendly church
