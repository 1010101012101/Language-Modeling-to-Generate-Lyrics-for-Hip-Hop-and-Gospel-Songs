Devin, what the fuck you do in here, man? 
 Oh goddamn, you on that beat bop shit still? 
 Man, what the fuck you talkin' about, nigga? 
 Hip-hop, muthafuckin' 
 Hell man, so you gotta let me get on somethin', man 
 Let me get on this mic right here 
 Man, come on, dog, hold up now 
 I'm right in the middle of this mutha 
 Come on, Devin boy 
 You can let me get one of 'em 
 Alright man, just 
 What you got some beer? 
 Hell yeah, I got some beer 
 You got some weed? 
 Hell yeah, I got some weed around here 
 Here, check it out 
 That sweet's killer, man 
 I'm high, 'Like An Eagle' 
 And like the Steve Miller Band 
 I'm a smoker, a midnight toker 
 Get the Adidas box top 
 Under the sofa with the joker 
 Then roll a big old fat square like this here 
 Smell like a punk head 
 Man, I bet yo weed ain't better than mine 
 Oh, that's bullshit 
 Take heed of my weed, man, all you need is a little bit 
 Now don't kill it 
 Hell man, I took a couple of pulls 
 Here, take two of my Budweisers, give me two of your Bulls 
 Man, I'ma give you two of these balls 
 If you don't get your muthafuckin' ass 
 Come on, Devin, don't do me like that, man 
 Come on, let me rock one with you 
 Hey, come on, man 
 I'm right in the middle of this shit, man 
 You need a hook or somethin' 
 Man, you don't even listen to rap music 
 Hell yeah I do, aight fuck it, come on 
 Follow through with the hook then 
 Come on 
 Reefer and beer 
 Can you say that? 
 Reefer and beer 
 Put some soul in it, make it like 
 Reefer and beer 
 Reefer and beer 
 High, yes I am, smokin' this weed again 
 I had one sweet left, I broke it down and rolled two 
 And sold them hoes and scored a three for ten 
 I spend my cash and time on grass and wine 
 You ask for my opinion, I say it don't make 
 A lot of hoes hope you choke and stay broke 
 Or smoke coke but nope, I bend but won't break 
 I made major mistakes but hey, they're all mine 
 You gotta learn how to get up when you fall down 
 Lived in a small town 
 Throwin' rocks at cows in a field of dreams 
 Hopin' it will amount to just more than a hell of beans 
 I feel the need for beer and weed 
 Why don't you smoke some here with me? 
 And we can ride through the ghettos and trailer parks 
 We can drink and spark until it gets dark 
 I wake up in the mornin' and I roll me a square 
 Sweet or whatever, I put that hoe in the air 
 Hit that muthafucka couple of times 
 Sit back and recline and try to relax my mind 
 With some 
 Reefer and beer 
 Reefer and beer 
 Reefer and beer 
 Reefer and beer 
 It's a brand new you 
 I guess it's time to start anew 
 Time to get our shit together 
 Think about things we gotta do 
 Stay close to all our family 
 Keep in touch with all our friends 
 Last year was kinda shaky 
 It's time for makin' some ends 
 Take care of our kids and then go and get some 
 Reefer and beer 
 Reefer and beer 
 Reefer and beer, yeah 
 Reefer and beer, yeah 
 Yeah man, that shit was aight 
 Man, we'll use that shit 
 Right over our first track 
 You my nigga, man 
 Yeah, you my nigger too 
 What? You're my nigger too, nigger 
 My nigga, man, nigga, nigga 
 Nigga, nigga 
 Nah man, just fuck it then 
 Don't say it at all 
 Fuck it
