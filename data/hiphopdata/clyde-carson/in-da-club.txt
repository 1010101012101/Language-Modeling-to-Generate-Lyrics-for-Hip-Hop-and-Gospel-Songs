 Compton, kingston. 
 Throw your dubs in the sky, twist it up let's get high, 
 Hit the switch in the ride, front to back side to side, 
 Compton kingston, 
 Who gun get drunk tonight, who wanna cut tonight, 
 It's going down inside, who in the club tonight, 
 Who gun get drunk tonight, who wanna cut tonight, 
 It's going down inside, who in the club tonight? 
 (Clyde)

 (The Game) 
 Lets Go, 
 You know who it is when you see that Rolls Phantom pull up 
 In the drop got a red bandana hold up 
 Tangerine guts with the gun metal hood 
 The driver survivor baby what's good 
 Cut the rope on the v.i.p 
 My black card is all you need to set you free 
 What you drinkin' what you thinkin' 
 You got a girlfriend from clyde and sean kingston
