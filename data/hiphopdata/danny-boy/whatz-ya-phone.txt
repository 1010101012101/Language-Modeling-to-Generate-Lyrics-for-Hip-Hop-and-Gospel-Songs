What'z ya phone number 
 Now I could make miracles with pimp hoes 
 It's instrumental 
 Waitin' for the nymphos 
 That's the intro 
 Shook when ya rush me 
 Walked up and touched me 
 Why? Do you want to fuck me 
 Just 'cause I'm paid in the worst way 
 True 
 Lookin' kind a good in your birthday suit 
 I wonder if your wild and ya act shy 
 Do you like to be on top or the back side 
 Watch me while you lick your lips, shake your hips 
 Goddamn, I love that shit 
 Yo, let's stop fakin' and be real now 
 I got a room and a hard on 
 Still down 
 Met ya standin' at a bar full of black dudes 
 Said ya want to see my scars and my tattoos 
 When we head for my hideout, act right 
 Boss playa when I ride out, that's right 
 What'z ya phone number 
 If you really want to fuck with me, I'm ready 
 Baby, let me give you a call 
 How long will it take to break you off 
 Oh shit, baby is a dime piece 
 Wanted this fine seat 
 Personally blessed from the gods 
 If I see ya right 
 Now she can get me hard 
 Didn't want to talk to me, till she see my car 
 Never had sex with a rich rap star 
 Till I got her in the back of my homeboys' car 
 Tell me, why do we live this way 
 Money over bitches 
 Let me hear you say: What'z your phone number 
 Are you alone 
 Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone 
 Time for your girlfriend to take you home 
 I had fun 
 But baby, gotta leave me alone 
 Picture in my rhyme 
 Take time to rewind these ordinary words I say 
 If you open your mind 
 Bet in a minute you'll find it's time 
 Let the Outlaws play 
 What'z ya phone number
