(Trip Lee) 
 I hear the troubles comin' for me, death is at my door way 
 Fear says I'ma perish bro, but that ain't what my Lord say 
 He said I ain't guilty though I still ain't had my court date 
 Taste it and I've seen him even though it's just a foretaste 
 I don't know what they feelin', I don't know what they thinkin' 
 Bro my soul's invincible like Mario when he blinkin' 
 Hey they see me full of joy like I don't know what he drinkin' 
 Cup is full of living water bro I sip it and thank him 
 Yes sir, might not win a Grammy, or get another stellar 
 But I get rewards from my Lord, it ain't nothin' better 
 I might not chart again, I might not sell a milli 
 But I been purchased by my King, he's forever with me 
 So what they talkin' bout? No they can't knock me down 
 Yes sir I do feel pain, but Jesus got me now 
 That's why I'm making noise, that's why I'm running hard 
 That's why I go gorilla spittin' the monkey bars 
 (Lecrae and Trip Lee) 
 Partner you know I'm good to go 
 Pressure creates diamonds and fire refines the gold 
 Ain't nothin' on this planet is satisfying my soul 
 I'm livin' for tomorrow, today is out of control, fo' sho 
 (I'm good!) Take all my money 
 (I'm good!) Here come the pain 
 (I'm good!) Yeah they can kill me 
 (I'm good!) To die is gain 
 I'm good, I ain't sayin' that we don't feel any pain 
 I'm just sayin' you can't take us out the game 
 'Cause homie we good 
 (Lecrae) 
 I done been through the fire, I survived all the floods 
 And the riders that's with me, they all covered in blood 
 Drag my name through the mud, they can hate they can gossip 
 But my passion for Jesus, they ain't never gon' stop it 
 I was dead, I guess that make me better than I ever was 
 Look at me I'm good, partner I'm on my forever buzz 
 If everything I have is taken I can take it 
 They say I'll never make it, I know the person who made it 
 My life is hidden in him, so when I die I gain 
 And Jesus really be walkin' with me, so how I'm lame? 
 My life's full of pain, problems, and such 
 But I'm focused on forever and eternity's touch 
 While the world try to fight me, Pharisees try to stone me 
 I am Tebow in the fourth quarter, they can't hold me 
 Yeah the Lord is my coach, got me off in the zone 
 Tell my momma that I'm good when he carry me home 
 I'm good 
 (Trip Lee) 
 I know that I'ma suffer, that'll only make me tougher 
 Death is just a doorway to take me to my faithful lover 
 The lover of my soul's with me, you can shake the brother 
 But you'll never knock me down or take me under, bring the thunder 
 Let the storms come to hound us and hurt us 
 They can't take our Lord from us, bro we got us a verdict 
 Not guilty, he's with us and he stays present 
 He never leaves me, he even gives me stage presence
