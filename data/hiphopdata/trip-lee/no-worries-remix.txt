I told them brothers that His standard's too high 
 I ain't stutter but they wonder how I plan on getting by 
 I just tell them I ain't got no worries, I ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 Yeah, I ain't got no worries, I ain't worried 'bout a thing

 Hey, Trip, I'm feeling good, ain't worried 'bout a thing 
 I'm feeling like a winner since I been put on the game 
 See some think it's the fame, or that I'm trusting change 
 But when my change strange I'm still trusting in the King 
 I'm so turned up, no liquor in my veins 
 I know you get the picture, no purple in my frame 
 And speaking of my frames, no I ain't wearing Prada 
 No Gucci or no Louis, but worries: I got nada 
 My comforts in the Father, he take care of my needs 
 I swear the world ain't big enough to satisfy my greed 
 The Lord is my Shepherd, I'm on them 23's 
 Don't try to gas me up 'cause I don't run on gasoline 
 And you know what I mean, 'cause I ain't talking cars 
 The peace I got is dope, man, and I ain't talking hard 
 Hey, you know what I'm saying, 'cause I ain't talking bills 
 The hope I got is priceless and I ain't taking deals

 Prior to Christ, your boy was dumb and God shoulda smashed me 
 Headed, headed nowhere fast and I doubt if you'd pass me 
 Wishing for heaven like God had a glass-jarred genie 
 My lips touched the Dutch but never Martini (never drank though) 
 16 years in that graveyard (graveyard), one word from Christ now I am a Braveheart 
 What do I mean? That my heart is brave 
 And that's the way it's been paved, not the mark it's made 
 Jesus saves cause the standard is high (the standard is high) 
 And not supposed to save yourself like to stand in the sky (stand in the sky) 
 To say you can is a unanimous lie 
 That's why the Father sent the Son to the planet to die 
 But he didn't stay dead (dead), he resurrected, 'cause 
 And it's on that basis that I am accepted, 'cause 
 And even though I fall short as a Christian now (I do) 
 I'm made and seen as perfect in position now

 Hey, what a mystery (what?), looking at my past I should be history (yeah?) 
 But God saw fit to see me walking in his victory (okay) 
 It's out with the old me, He chose me and evicted me (yeah) 
 It's in with the new me, the new, man, He is fixing me (c'mon) 
 My Lord was a carpenter, He put me back together, man 
 Better feelings, better actions, and I got a better brain 
 Blew my old brains out, man it's a beretta, man 
 The spirit blows where it wishes, now I'm His forever, man 
 Can't lie, that I'ma still be sinning till the day I die 
 But I'm also fighting like a titan tryna stay alive 
 Sin brings death to me, Jesus is my way to God 
 I'm going down if He ain't around, like Mary J. describes (yes sir) 
 I feel a peace cause Jesus, He intercedes 
 Earned death from my Daddy, my sin is in His decease 
 Cast away, it was placed on the sinless, He intervened 
 Got no worries on my brain, I'm singing it in the streets
