(Chorus - Jimmy Neeham) 
 I just wanna go where 
 I'm only breathing your air 
 Father, hear my prayer, take me there 
 Take me there 
 I just wanna see you 
 Brighter than I'm used to 
 Finally see you clear, take me there 
 Take me there, take me there 
 (Verse 1 - Trip Lee) 
 Tell me, have you ever seen a 
 Brother so weighted you can tell by his demeanor? 
 That he's really jaded, tryna get off this arena? 
 He long for something greater but they say he's just a dreamer 
 But he has a treasure that he holds like gold 
 'Cause he knows something that the boys don't know 
 Nothing seems funny when his money's so low 
 But when he thinks about that place, man he really wants to go 
 That he ain't all obsessed with the cash he can stack 
 'Cause he's looking to the heavens where his master is at 
 But he does have treasure and he's storing it up 
 Seems foreign to us, it can't be stolen or rust 
 So when the cares of this world start weighing on him hard 
 And he's tired of them bills he's been paying on his car 
 He can't wait to be embraced by the Lord, face to face 
 So he waits for his reward, and he sings ... 
 (Chorus - Jimmy Neeham) 
 I just wanna go where 
 I'm only breathing your air 
 Father, hear my prayer, take me there 
 Take me there 
 I just wanna see you 
 Brighter than I'm used to 
 Finally see you clear, take me there 
 Take me there, take me there 
 (Verse 2 - Trip Lee) 
 Tell me, have you ever seen her? 
 She's sick with a disease and it's really tryna beat her 
 It's taking all her strength, she know that it can't defeat her 
 'Cause she gon' be with Jesus, she's more than just a dreamer 
 Her peace and her joy, man they really ain't gone 
 It's all because she knows earth really ain't home 
 And even when she's by herself she's really not alone 
 Her Savior's there with her while she's singing this song 
 She know sickness might get her and death might grab her 
 But she ain't scared of death 'cause she trusted in the Master 
 Was buried but he rose up a few days after 
 So death may attack her but death cannot have her 
 So she tells her family "Don't worry anymore" 
 When she's gone from the body she'll be present with the Lord 
 Her body will be raised, so much glory is in store 
 He is her reward so she sings ... 
 (Chorus - Jimmy Neeham) 
 I just wanna go where 
 I'm only breathing your air 
 Father, hear my prayer, take me there 
 Take me there 
 I just wanna see you 
 Brighter than I'm used to 
 Finally see you clear, take me there 
 Take me there, take me there 
 (Verse 3 - Trip Lee) 
 Hey, I ain't know about you but I can't wait till the day 
 When I'll be with my Lord and everything is ok 
 And I'll be just like him, so my sin ain't in the way 
 Basking in his glory, that's where I wanna stay 
 A place where shadows give way to the real 
 And circumstances can't change the way that I feel 
 Joy of my Savior, they say we can't steal 
 Because he's been defeated, yeah you know the deal 
 The real good life, I can't wait, please save me soon 
 Until then I'll be praising in the waiting room 
 Fighting by his grace, can't wait to embrace the groom 
 Until then I'm like ... 
 (Chorus - Jimmy Neeham) 
 I just wanna go where 
 I'm only breathing your air 
 Father, hear my prayer, take me there 
 Take me there 
 I just wanna see you 
 Brighter than I'm used to 
 Finally see you clear, take me there 
 Take me there, take me there
