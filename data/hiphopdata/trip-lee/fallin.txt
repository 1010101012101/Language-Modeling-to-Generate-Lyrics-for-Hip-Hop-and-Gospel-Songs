 I don't really want it but it's calling my name 
 "William, come and get me, I can take away the pain 
 Come a little closer you got everything to gain" 
 But I got too much to lose, I'm bout to go insane 
 I been here too many times, got my head low 
 If I gave a dime for every time, I'd be dead broke 
 I feel that battle in my soul, the pressure closing in 
 My passions asking for a pass and I can't hold it in, there I go again 
 No self-control again, I'm too good at giving in 
 Feeling like throwing in the towel, the guilt is closing in 
 Sometimes I climb the heights but I'm at my lowest end 
 Cloaked in deception and overdosing on potent sin 
 I'm so gone baby, wanna be home again 
 Wanna feel whole again, come fill this hole again 
 Now I'm doubled over with my face in my knees 
 At your side is where I wanna be 
 But there I go again fallin' ... 
 J. Paul and Trip Lee 
 I fall face to the pavement 
 Once again faced with the same sin 
 (There I go again, fallin') 
 I don't think I'ma make it 
 Don't know how much longer I can take it 
 (There I go again, fallin') 
 So I'm caught up in this sin 
 I wonder if I'll see your face again 
 (There I go again, fallin') 
 Fallin', fallin', fallin' 
 There I go 
 Trip Lee 
 Trying to keep it cool, I don't wanna lead 'em playing 
 But it's hard to block out everything that she be saying 
 L-like "keep coming baby, just reach out and take my hand 
 There's no need to fear me, all I wanna do is dance" 
 I believe the lie, now I'm headed for my doom 
 They have finally got me locked and I'm bout to be consumed 
 Feeling like I'm watched by everybody in the room 
 'Cause they know I'm a fake, and if not they will soon 
 Have you ever felt like the walls finna close in 
 Shackles on your hands and your feet and you're dozing? 
 Sleep till the logic you possessed before all of the mess 
 All sober-headed mess with the rest, what's left 
 Is a schizophrenic sin where a man once was 
 Now you get to see the damage your lust does 
 So now I'm doubled over with my face in my knees 
 At your side is where I wanna be 
 But there I go again, fallin' ...

 Fallin', fallin', fallin'

 Every time I fall, he gon' pick me up 
 The Lord is my shepherd homie, he go'n pick me up 
 I fell into the trap again, but he go'n pick me up 
 Remind me of his promises, in him I put my trust 
 I don't never have to give in to the lies 
 I'm feasting on his Word, all my sin I do despise 
 So now I'm down before his throne praying on my knees 
 Asking "Lord, give me grace please" 
 I don't wanna be fallin' ... 
 J. Paul and Trip Lee 
 I fall, so I gotta face this 
 But I know there's nothing that he can't fix 
 (I don't wanna be fallin') 
 Looking to the cross where they placed him 
 'Cause I know his grace is amazing 
 (I don't wanna be fallin') 
 He's covered all my sin 
 It's gone, never to be seen again 
 (So I'm callin') 
 Callin', callin', callin' 
 Out to you
