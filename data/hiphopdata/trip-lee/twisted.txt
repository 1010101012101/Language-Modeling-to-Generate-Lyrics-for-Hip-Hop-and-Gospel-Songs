 Uh... yeah... it's Wayne Gretzky on his neckpiece 
 It got him feeling real hefty on his best week 
 Huh but let see, he say he make it rain 
 But yet the sky's still bluer than a gas flame 
 I mean let's make it plain, somebody keep him breathin' 
 Keep his blood flowin', and keep his heart beatin' 
 God keep him eatin', and it ain't no secret 
 Don't get it twisted, God gave him what he needed 
 My life ain't never been mine, yeah I work hard and yeah I grind 
 But not to get rich man not to shine, not to get rich man not to shine 
 And I don't boast much, I don't brag, 'cause everything I got man I got it from dad 
 And matter fact ain't one thing I have that God ain't put here in my hand 
 So I say remember that your legs work, 'cause of him 
 Next time you runnin' for your goals think who's really runnin' it 
 Everything is under him ' planets, countries, cities, hoods 
 Don't get it twisted God did it, done it, got it? Good 
 PRo: 
 Say they fly, but that's a lie, man they got it twisted 
 Rings of gold and crispy clothes, man they got it twisted 
 I bet you think you a god but boy you got it twisted 
 Tw-tw-twisted, tw-tw-twisted 
 Get a little bit of money, stack a little bit of cheddar, then we get the game so twisted 
 20-somethin' inches on a little bit a leather then we get get things so twisted 
 I bet you think you so hard but boy you got it twisted 
 Tw-tw-twisted, tw-tw-twisted 
 Trip Lee: 
 Yes sir, back on that thang, reflectin' on life an its happiness mayne 
 Since I was born I had what I needed, when I think back ain't been lackin' a thang 
 Clothes I rock, soda pop, the home I got, the cash in the bank 
 The bros I got, the shoes I buy, none of us lacked it was passed from the King 
 When I think I was growin' up, so many things was loaned to us 
 We holdin' up on some dough for lunch, and I'd say my grace and then get with the game 
 Never really thought of his mercy flows, never really heard the words before 
 Every good thing is comin' down from the Father of Lights like a passionate rain 
 Yeah tell them to get back, man how they think they get that 
 The Father gave me gift wrap though he don't have to give jack 
 We ain't earned a single thing, no homie, don't miss that 
 He gives because he's merciful now spit that, don't get it twisted 
 Hey yeah some of us are strugglin' they off in hoods 
 But still get more than they deserve look all he does is good 
 He gives freely and he's perfect in his distribution 
 Don't get it screwed up like you lived in Houston 
 Thi'sl: 
 Some things that I think are good in life they make me nervous 
 Anything my Father give me though I know it's perfect 
 Anything I get besides my death I don't deserve it 
 Used to think that I was good to have cash splurging 
 I was a trap star, sixteen ' phat car 
 Anything that made me feel good was good, that far 
 Kept them bangers with me like I'm good, gon' act hard 
 Even kept that green bay too, yeah ' Brett Favre 
 See my whole thought of good was out of context 
 Didn't know what good was 'cause I hadn't seen the Son yet 
 Ran around with different girls like it was a contest 
 Young and dumb, foolish too, I was on some nonsense 
 Thought it was good that the whole hood heard of me 
 They thought it was good that other hoods wanna murder me 
 Somebody call the cops 'cause it's an emergency 
 Now I know what good is ' it's God's love and mercy
