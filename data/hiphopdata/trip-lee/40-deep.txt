 Yo clicked up 40 deep in the street you can find us 
 Ya, we on theology but we be on the grind ya 
 When we was a youngster, only had 2 place to run to 
 One become an animal, two get out the jungle 
 So we got our lion on the line bro, that's what we do 
 Run up on you 
 And your crew 
 And tell y'all Jesus is the truth 
 Open air evangelism, relationships we do it all 
 Backpack filled with tracks with a Johnny Mac hat to the back and our backs to the wall 
 Plus I got some homies out there who gunna rep the wall 
 If you wanna make them stop you gunna have to bring a choppa 
 If they get martyred (murdered) then we gunna go harder 
 Share the gospel on death row and let them know that they been pardoned 
 You don't wanna get it started this is what we do, who we are 
 116 to the day we die, ain't tryin' to be no superstars 
 Chicks to the click that'll pull your car? 
 Usin' the street light pulls in cars? 
 You ain't hear the truth today, I promise we'll be back tomorrow
