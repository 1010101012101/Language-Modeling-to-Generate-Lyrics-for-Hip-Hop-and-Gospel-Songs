Look, creation's groanin' 
 Lost they hope and feel they always closed in 
 Lots to cope with, on the ropes, wish they was in the open 
 This broken world is so dim 
 Our souls are searching, gropin'. 
 For one with hope to hold us close, and set goodness in motion 
 I remember growing up in Dallas, thought me and my close kin 
 Was more than straight, our folks was great, not broke that paper flowed in 
 Not boasting man, just saying in my brain I didn't know then 
 That all went wrong, and it can't just go right like a broke pen 
 My mind was blind and cloaked in, 
 Then that foolishness departed 
 Saw this thing's an ocean, 
 And we just tryna swim real far but 
 Can't nobody float when 
 We ain't got boats or no fins 
 We need a hero to go in, 
 'Cause our solutions don't win 
 Education can't fix it, 
 More dough just leads to more sin 
 Medicine is temporary, government seems so thin 
 With all these weighty problems, that ain't shrinking they just growing 
 Who's adequate to save us, 
 How about He who knew no sin? 
 Like a G5 yeah You rushed to rescue me 
 Took the cross in exchange for a crown to save me 
 You began the work and I know You'll finish 
 And make all things right when you come back 
 'Cause You're my hero, 
 You already saved the day 
 Yes you're my hero, 
 And I know you're coming back for me 
 Follow the steps bro, 
 Adam sinned now we all dead so 
 We gotta sentence on our head like death row, 
 Everything is wrecked 
 All creation is a mess so, 
 In the fullness of time, 
 In steps the hero no red cloak, He's Jesus 
 No flashing lights, glitz 'n' glam, no cameras 
 Came to serve needy folks, and point them to the answer 
 You see Him healing, feeding folks, and telling them the standard 
 Our most basic need is to be ransomed by Jesus. 
 First place, yeah we separated in the worst ways 
 Even physically peep how the earth quakes 
 Separated socially, got murders and the worst rapes 
 Even separated from ourselves, we in the worst state. 
 Yeah it's so major, 
 But that's the reason that we need a Savior 
 The root of every need is separation from Creator 
 Jesus came humbly to restore us to our maker 
 And later He'll restore all that He made bruh, He's Jesus 
 Like a G5 yeah You rushed to rescue me 
 Took the cross in exchange for a crown to save me 
 You began the work and I know You'll finish 
 And make all things right when you come back 
 'Cause You're my hero, 
 You already saved the day 
 Yes you're my hero, 
 Yeah, God is not pleased man, 
 It's clear that His standard's missed 
 'Cause the world is rampant with, 
 Sin it's an abandonment 
 Man is feeling stranded, feeling hopeless since his banishment 
 God is angry at the distortion and the mismanagement 
 Evil is at work, but don't be thinking He can't handle it 
 He promised He would do away with all of it, dismantle it 
 He's put up with this damage in His world, but He promised us 
 That He'll destroy all His enemies and then He'll walk with us 
 New Heaven, new Earth 
 That's where all His sheep dwell 
 Jesus succeeded in every part of life that we failed 
 Died a death we couldn't die, 
 Paid our price with three nails 
 Began the work He promised, in the end we all will be well 
 Already beat his enemies and when His Kingdom's realized 
 All those who oppose Him will see Jesus through some real eyes 
 Deliverance is offered us, 
 The hero He is urging us 
 Salvation is exclusive to His people who have turned to trust 
 I give my gratitude (Jesus). 
 You died to make all things new - yeah. 
 My knight in armor when our world is fallen. 
 Your love's never failing. 
 I find safety in your arms. 
 Like a G5 yeah You rushed to rescue me 
 Took the cross in exchange for a crown to save me 
 You began the work and I know You'll finish 
 And make all things right when you come back 
 'Cause You're my hero, 
 You already saved the day 
 Yes you're my hero,
