(Verse 1 - Trip Lee) 
 Yeah, yeah, you know the plight of us 
 All the pains and the strains that this life covers 
 Things never go right, it's the gripe of us 
 It's like life came and took all the life from us, from us 
 Was supposed to go this way 
 Hearts cold from coast to coast this days 
 Full of hope and nope it's gone, this grave 
 We need light and life to come invade 
 This cold world ain't nice to us 
 We so blind like the sights took our sight from us 
 I know you heard it more than once kinda like stutters 
 But this world needs help, all the likes of us, of us 
 What a lonely road is paved 
 With some broken souls that groan midways 
 On our domes we long to go get away 
 We can't go it alone, come on invade 
 (Chorus - J. Paul) 
 In this broken world we wanna bat away 
 'Cause it all went wrong, tell me who can save the day? 
 Invade our world (come and invade our world) 
 Invade our world (come and invade our world) 
 (Verse 2 - Trip Lee) 
 You know the place where we placed at 
 It's like love's been erased, they replaced that 
 There's no food in the crib where they plates at 
 The kid got shot in the place where he plays at 
 Chase said this can't be life 
 I'm lookin' at the world like this can't be right 
 We lookin' for the light but we can't beat night 
 We lookin' for our health but we can't see right (see right) 
 Come on y'all, we gotta face facts 
 As years go, tears roll down to face that 
 When he had a lot of hope it would fade black 
 Now he cold and he ain't really fazed at 
 Anything in his face seems light 
 'Cause his money's out like it made three strikes 
 Needs someone to come down, invade these nights 
 A real life Hero need that'll make things right 
 (Chorus - J. Paul) 
 (Verse 3 - Trip Lee) 
 I know what some folks thinkin' 
 This dude trippin', what he drinkin'? 
 What kinda little dream he chasin'? He gon' spend his whole life waitin' (I'm waitin') 
 For someone to come down to change this song 
 But not just me, man creation groans 
 We are waitin' for someone to erase this wrong 
 The Kingdom is here, the invasion's on 
 (Chorus - J. Paul) 
 Come and invade our world 
 Come and invade our world 
 Come and invade our world 
 Come and invade our world
