Can I brag on my Lord? 
 Go and brag on him, Trip 
 Can I brag on my Lord? 
 Go and brag on him, Trip 
 Can I brag on my Lord? 
 Go and brag on him, Trip 
 Let me brag on my Lord 
 Yeah he's hotter than fires, we roll with the flyest 
 He touch me and I change kinda like he's King Midas 
 He rolled me three-hundred way before a Leonidas 
 He holds me down, I call him Your Highness ... get it? 
 I heard other faith groups talkin' 'bout they where the light is 
 But the Father's partial to Christ, he's got a bias 
 He never does it quite the way we think, he's got surprises 
 Our eyes is focused on him so we fired up and we wired 
 He took us out the dirt, grimy muck in the mire 
 Addicted to his grace, man I call him my supplier 
 Then we call him Most High cause ain't nobody higher 
 King Jesus, we not sleepin' on him, all nighter 
 No he's not Elijah, greater than Jeremiah 
 He's the best, hear the crowd screaming from the risers 
 Been workin' for eternity but never been hired 
 He's on his Brett Favre, you can't make him retire 
 (Brag on him) I'm still goin', can't quiet us 
 The Light of the World, nobody's brighter, I try to 
 Emulate his walk, I ain't original I strive to 
 Copy his style, I aspire to be abider 
 You can't make us turn on him for prizes and bribe us 
 Check his power mayne, from his love you can't pry us 
 Not even with pliers, so please don't even try to 
 If loving him's a crime, then indict us (I gotta brag)
