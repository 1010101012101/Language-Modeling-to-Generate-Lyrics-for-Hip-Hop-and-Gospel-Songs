Yeah, look 
 Eh, they say hind sight is 20/20, well they right its behind me 
 Back for the third time, you know where to find me 
 Hanging on the coat tail of Christ who designed me 
 Keep me off your brain, in other words don't mind me 
 The Lord keeps me low no matter where them folks fly me 
 Message so timeless, the beats so timely 
 Spittin' for my boss like He signed me 
 Usually roll with a group of brothers like the Isleys 
 We came to spit it for the King that you can't erase 
 We give you facts over music, call it databass (yes sir) 
 We press forward to the prize hope we ain't astray 
 No fallin' back from the goal, no fade aways 
 Pour my heart out when I write till it pumps on the page 
 Beats over the beat, and it jumps on the stage 
 Cries out for the souls that are hurtin' finna lose it 
 Here to lift you up call it elevator music 
 Eh, this that real life music 
 Get dem hands up for that real life music 
 Eh, this that real life music 
 Getcha mind ready for that real life music 
 Just wanna give you somethin' real 
 Ain't comin' atcha neck, no we ain't comin' atcha grill 
 Eh look we know just how you feel, but we just wanna give you something real 
 Look, eh too many spit that fake rap that most just can't relate to 
 They ain't got no maybach, they don't get to make rules 
 They not tryna make stacks, they just tryna make due 
 Waitin for that payback, for all the work that they do 
 We ain't in a dream world, we spittin' that real life 
 We live in the real world, and know just what it feels like 
 So we pressin in like steel spikes 
 To stand in a fallen world it don't feel nice 
 Eh, even if you're rich or you gotta lota cash 
 You still not exempt as everybody on the map 
 We all feel the pressure heavy burdens on our backs 
 Everyday its still hard, but we learnin like its class 
 In this cold cold world, where them scammers be 
 And so many lost they footin, like an amputee 
 We know that everybody wonder why the worlds gone wrong 
 Got some real life music fo' ya dome, gone 
 Eh, this that real life music 
 Get dem hands up for that real life music 
 Eh, this that real life music 
 Getcha mind ready for that real life music 
 Just wanna give you somethin' real 
 Ain't comin' atcha neck, no we ain't comin' atcha grill 
 Eh look we know just how you feel, but we just wanna give you something real
