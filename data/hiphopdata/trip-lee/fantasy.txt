(Hook - Suzy Rock) 
 Oh ... 
 We're living in la la la la la la land 
 Oh ... 
 We living a lie lie lie lie lie lie la la 
 Oh ... 
 We're living in la la la la la la land 
 Oh ... 
 We're living in la la la la la la land 
 (Verse 1 - Trip Lee) 
 You're tryna live the dream, ain't you? 
 The cream, esteem, supreme paper 
 You're thinking this the place to be like green acres 
 Look, you're living a dream and I can't even wake you 
 I know you want the life that they all desire 
 Wanna rise till you can't imagine climbing higher 
 But that ladder can't stand when it catches fire 
 And when it stops you'll be shocked like electric wires 
 It's cool to like fairytales 
 Until you try to live inside of them is where we fail 
 The media pushin' death and they do it very well 
 Man, who would have thought that obituaries sell? 
 Look, you're living in a dream 
 Open up your eyes, things ain't always what they seem 
 Reality ain't always what we find up on the screen 
 They got bait in they hooks, they got rhymes full of schemes 
 Fantasy ... 
 (Chorus - Suzy Rock) 
 Fantasy, masquerades, and mansions 
 (All they want is that fantasy) 
 Smoking lights, but there is never light within us 
 Smiles full of envy 
 A full house that's empty 
 Once the night is up 
 It's never enough 
 (Verse 2 - Trip Lee) 
 Your imagination's running wild 
 Your main goal is to stack a couple hundred thou' 
 Then more money, plus you want it now 
 You'll be hunting for them hundreds till you run 'em down 
 Plus you want chicks, wanna pick and choose 
 She gotta be a freak, not just any chick will do 
 That's the story that you stickin' to, listen dude 
 Just know the fable that they told you really isn't true 
 Hey mami, you think you want that life, don't you? 
 Till you that fine dime, all them brothers drooling over 
 But you should know your beauty will be moving over 
 When he cracks the sky like a supernova to expose us 
 I ain't runnin' game, I ain't got nothing to gain 
 My lines tell you 'bout this life but something is strange 
 If the highest joy is found in created things 
 Instead of something greater but I gotta make a claim 
 It's fantasy ... 
 (Chorus - Suzy Rock) 
 Fantasy, masquerades, and mansions 
 (All they want is that fantasy) 
 Smoking lights, but there is never light within us 
 Smiles full of envy 
 A full house that's empty 
 Once the night is up 
 It's never enough 
 (Hook - Suzy Rock) 
 Oh ... 
 We're living in la la la la la la land 
 Oh ... 
 We living a lie lie lie lie lie lie la la 
 Oh ... 
 And you gon' see it all for what it is 
 Oh ... 
 I pray you'll see it all for what it is 
 (Verse 3 - Trip Lee) 
 Welcome to the real world 
 Where there's real treasure, real pearls 
 Those who try to gain the world only lose souls 
 And chasing fool's goals only gets you fool's gold 
 Well, welcome to the good life where there's real joy 
 Now that old life seems like a killjoy 
 It's ironic that the life giver was killed, boy 
 He rose and he chose me, you know he fills a real void 
 We were made to be connected to the life giver 
 To build our life around him with his life in us 
 But our pride likes to rise, them lies get us 
 They separate us from the good, we despise Scripture 
 But we can turn back, to the forever source 
 The one who can't be described by my metaphors 
 Even if I'm poor, I'm rich if I let him set the course 
 In his right hand the pleasure's forever more 
 (Chorus - Suzy Rock) 
 Fantasy, masquerades, and mansions 
 (We don't have to live in that fantasy) 
 Smoking lights, but there is never light within us 
 Smiles full of envy 
 A full house that's empty 
 Once the night is up 
 It's never enough 
 (Hook - Suzy Rock) 
 Oh ... 
 We're living in la la la la la la land 
 Oh ... 
 We living a lie lie lie lie lie lie la la 
 Oh ... 
 And you gon' see it all for what it is 
 Oh ... 
 I pray you'll see it all for what it is
