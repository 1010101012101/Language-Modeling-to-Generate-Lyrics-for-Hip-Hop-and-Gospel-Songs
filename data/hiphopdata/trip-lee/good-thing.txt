 The gift that God has given got me so amazed 
 I get better than if earned like I'm overpaid 
 I ain't deserve it at all, homie I know it's grace 
 But God gave me a wife to hold for all my days, she got me more than dazed 
 Babe, your more than antidote to lonely days 
 You're my partner, you got my back with no delays 
 You don't just hold me down, you help me behold his ways 
 We seek his holy face though the surface is only grazed 
 Babe, I never thought that I would be the type 
 Choosing chilling with my wife over trying to sleep at night 
 But we kick it real hard, you're never leaving, right? 
 Well good, 'cause I love the ways that we alike 
 I found a good thing, praise God for wedding bells 
 This marriage is a picture of the story heaven tells 
 That means this oneness can't be severed, well very well 
 By God's grace I married well, I found a good thing 
 (Leah Smith) 
 You'll always be my love (oh my my my) 
 You'll always be my love (my oh my) 
 I love you, I'll never leave, I want it to be 
 Always you and only you, I've found a good thing

 They said, "that boy insane. He gone, he lost his brain 
 He too zealous, he just tryna to go against the grain 
 He's got his whole life ahead of him, so this is strange" 
 But they don't get that getting other chicks just isn't gain 
 And marriage is a pain, in fact it's love and joy 
 God's plan for man and woman they wanna destroy 
 By acting like it's prison, avoid it 'cause it's hard 
 Look honestly if it don't hurt than you ain't loving hard 
 Look at Jesus on the cross, he got a ton of scars 
 Laid his life down for his bride 'cause his love is large 
 My Lord he set the bar high, and I'm falling short 
 But I'll be standing with my Savior when I'm called in court 
 So please forgive me baby when I don't love you right 
 You're so patient with me girl 'cause he's in your sights 
 So let's take on the world, let's love him hand in hand 
 Bye-bye to boyish ways, hello to family man 
 (Leah Smith) 
 You'll always be my love (oh my my my) 
 You'll always be my love (my oh my) 
 I love you, I'll never leave, I want it to be 
 Always you and only you, I've found a good thing

 We prayed our wildest dreams, "his will be done" we said 
 So let's be praying, bracing ourselves for what comes ahead 
 We pleaded with the Lord that he would give a child 
 And he graciously gave, though it took a while 
 Now there's a precious little soul, one who lives and moves 
 Never forget the way you smiled when you broke the news 
 And now your belly's growing, baby your skin is glowing 
 I already love him, I can't wait to get to know him 
 Till then I'm praying for him, that Jesus would sustain 
 Our little baby, protect him so that life remains 
 Through all the joys and pains, you know your husband's here 
 We'll run this race together, let's get this one thing clear 
 I'll never leave your side, I wasn't playing with you 
 When I wrote them vows, baby girl I'm staying with you 
 And there ain't nothing that can separate us in this life 
 Can't nothing ever separate us from the love of Christ 
 Forever ever ever 
 The Lord gon' be with us forever, ever ever 
 So girl I ain't gon' leave you ever, ever ever 
 The Lord gon' be with us forever, forever ever 
 So girl I ain't gon' leave you ever, ever ever 
 The Lord gon' be with us forever, ever ever 
 So girl I ain't gon' leave you ever, ever ever 
 The Lord gon' be with us forever, ever ever, ever ever 
 (Leah Smith) 
 You'll always be my love (oh my my my) 
 You'll always be my love (my oh my) 
 I love you, I'll never leave, I want it to be 
 Always you and only you, I've found a good thing
