I thought you already knew bruh, Christ switched the rules up 
 Dudes were trippin' when they got a glimpse of truth, the 
 Moves that made was insane, his crew of 
 Disciples, would later write it in the Bible the news of 
 Jesus, the Word, but it seemed too absurd 
 The majestic, in flesh with those he breathed from the Earth 
 Now we've seen the Father clearer than we'd seen him at first 
 In his Son, he's the one, it was seen in his works 
 The disciples had seen those days 
 He said "peace be still" and the sea obeyed, I'm so amazed 
 They was attached to the King, ok 
 But now he's telling them that soon he'll have to relocate 
 Oh no, but that's no reason to grumble, complain 
 In his name because he'll send another one of the same 
 Another paraclete, comforter, advocate, teacher 
 The helper, the one we have to get to get Jesus 
 He's coming, it ain't like he ain't capable of nothing 
 'Cause he'll convict the world of sin righteousness and judgment 
 There was much more to say that he left out of the discussion 
 But left it for the one who was coming 
 'Cause would guide them into truth, he would glorify the Christ 
 He'd reveal it to them dudes, about the Lord who died for life 
 So they need not sleep on the divinity 
 Of God the 3rd person of the trinity, the Spirit 
 Behold the Spirit, he is one with our Maker 
 Don't sleep (don't sleep), he's the way the men meet the Savior 
 (He's God) He's the way that men meet the Savior 
 (He's God) He's the way that men meet the Savior 
 Behold the Spirit, he's eternal, everlasting 
 Don't sleep (don't sleep), he's the way the men meet the Master 
 (He's God) He's the way that men meet the Master 
 (He's God) He's the way that men meet the Master 
 Please let me speak on, person number 3 homes 
 The one up in the trinity that most people sleep on 
 But how could that be homie? You can't deny that they're one 
 He has the same divine attributes as Father and Son 
 But many mistake his work and say he ain't a person 
 That's crazy, sounds to me like it's some false teaching lurking 
 I'm assured that he's a person, don't stay asleep I'm burning 
 Inside to tell you 'bout his personality and workings 
 He's eternal, proceeding from the Father 
 He has no beginning, that's prob'ly 'cause he's God bruh 
 Hovers over the water, he worked within creation 
 He always been without flaw, he's perfect and amazing 
 And in the Old Testament, he was work at in God's people 
 In Moses for example, that's the man that he would speak through 
 And these dudes, Joshua, Gideon, and Samson 
 Who granted him great strength? Yeah, the Holy Phantom 
 Plus the prophets, who told cats the lamb would be coming 
 Did it by the Spirit, now hear of the planned King's coming 
 He was conceived by the Spirit, anointed and filled 
 He was led by the Spirit, and each time that he healed 
 It was by him, as well as him resisting temptation 
 He did it all by the Spirit, not to mention his raising 
 Don't be a fool and sleep on the divinity 
 Of God the third person of the trinity, the Spirit 
 Behold the Spirit, he is one with our Maker 
 Don't sleep (don't sleep), he's the way the men meet the Savior 
 (He's God) He's the way that men meet the Savior 
 (He's God) He's the way that men meet the Savior 
 Behold the Spirit, he's eternal, everlasting 
 Don't sleep (don't sleep), he's the way the men meet the Master 
 (He's God) He's the way that men meet the Master 
 (He's God) He's the way that men meet the Master 
 How does the Spirit work now? I could go on for days 
 But I'll just give you a little bit and speak on some ways 
 He came as Christ told, with new work on the Earth 
 In Acts 2 at Pentecost peep the birth of the church 
 The holy text that we read was revealed by him 
 God breathed, and we can see that it's real by him 
 He illuminates it too, enables us to see 
 He's how you can say it's true, we enabled to believe 
 By his work, he regenerates though we depraved and thieves 
 He rebirths us, let's praise him, the slaves are freed 
 He's the Spirit of promise, he's the Spirit of truth 
 If you've been delivered from bondage, you will experience fruit 
 He makes us want to seek him, he leads us to Jesus 
 He teaches, plus he intercedes for believers 
 It seems that most folks, they are trippin' 
 'Cause his name's been marred by much emotionalism 
 The mark of his work isn't yelling and confusion 
 It's fruit like we see in the text, and it's through him 
 Don't get it twisted bro, the Bible is closed 
 His revelation is sufficient so abide in the scroll 
 Many act crazy and say it's him, but hear this 
 If don't match his Word, then it's not of the Spirit 
 So be amazed and in awe of his divinity 
 He's God, the third person of the trinity, the Spirit 
 Behold the Spirit, he is one with our Maker 
 Don't sleep (don't sleep), he's the way the men meet the Savior 
 (He's God) He's the way that men meet the Savior 
 (He's God) He's the way that men meet the Savior 
 Behold the Spirit, he's eternal, everlasting 
 Don't sleep (don't sleep), he's the way the men meet the Master 
 (He's God) He's the way that men meet the Master 
 (He's God) He's the way that men meet the Master
