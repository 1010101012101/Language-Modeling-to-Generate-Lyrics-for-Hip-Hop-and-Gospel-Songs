Forget about the cash, Forget about the clothes 
 Forget about the stash, Forget about the dough 
 Forget about the cars, Forget about the rims 
 Forget about dem stars, Forget about the benz 
 Forget about the big crib, tryna get rich, 
 The big six-fo, plenty dough and tryna sip chrys 
 Forget the cash and chains, that stuff will pass away 
 And you can't take it wit you to yer after days 
 Most are concerned with the cheddar flow, but dawg I gotta let 'em know 
 A lot of reasons we should be seeking Jesus instead of dough 
 Instead of mo material things, the jewelry 'n' fame 
 I speak of the Kang, but most ain't feeling me main 
 They would rather let they money stack, tryna get a hundred stack 
 They pockets fat, but they not ready when Christ is coming back 
 If they only knew the real truth about the comin' wrath 
 They would probably race to Him faster than a runnin' back 
 I know the things the cheddar buys, will attract and catch the eyes 
 Instead of ice, it'd be nice, if we would invest in life 
 Instead of all that flashy stuff, tryna get our status up 
 His wrath is just, so if we don't seek Him dawg then we outa luck 
 What good is it to gain the world and in'da end lose ya soul? 
 Its foolish bro, there's a lovin' savior you can truly know 
 I know you seeking satisfaction, you can't find it though 
 Tryna dash for the cash and designer clothes 
 Forget about the cash, Forget about the clothes 
 Forget about the stash, Forget about the dough 
 Forget about the cars, Forget about the rims 
 Forget about dem stars, Forget about the benz 
 Forget about the big crib, tryna get rich, 
 The big six-fo, plenty dough and tryna sip chrys 
 Forget the cash and chains, that stuff will pass away 
 And you can't take it wit you to yer after days 
 Got money, got whips, got ice 
 Still broke homeboy! No Christ 
 Got a debt to pay, some real heavy wages 
 And the payment for sin is pretty outrageous 
 I seen him park the car, suicide do's 
 Without Christ he walking through a suicide do' 
 The dollar bill say in God we trust 
 Its funny cause money is the only God we trust 
 And she say that she a Christian, but I can't tell 
 She ain't depending on God, she depend on man 
 1 stack, 2 stack, 3 stack, fo 
 They spent they whole life stacking up dough 
 And when they die not a dimes gone go 
 Now they physically rich, but they spiritually po' 
 And they probably never heard of 1 Corinthians chapter fo' 
 'Cause they said they can't imagine God's people being po' (whoa) 
 Forget about the cash, Forget about the clothes 
 Forget about the stash, Forget about the dough 
 Forget about the cars, Forget about the rims 
 Forget about dem stars, Forget about the benz 
 Forget about the big crib, tryna get rich, 
 The big six-fo, plenty dough and tryna sip chrys 
 Forget the cash and chains, that stuff will pass away 
 And you can't take it wit you to yer after days 
 You might want you some change, yeah you might want a crib 
 But tell me where the Bible say that Jesus want us rich? 
 It says we should be content if we got food and clothin' 
 That's the truth and bro, we tripping really being foolish homie 
 We shouldn't put no value on fallin' screens and stylish chrome 
 Even if you saved that stuff can't go with you when you back at home 
 So allow me to encourage you, if you agree the Word is true 
 You can only serve one Master, some of us is serving two 
 'Can't serve God and cash, can't love the world and Christ 
 Put money out ya mind, focus on eternal life 
 'Can't speak from experience, I ain't seen it but I'm betting 
 Treasures of this world ain't nothing next to the ones that's up in Heaven 
 Feel free to store 'em up, since we found the Lord is just 
 Amazing let us praise Him main and try to give Him more of us 
 Let us live our life with Him, spend our days and nights with Him 
 Ignore the trash the world has to offer and delight in Him 
 Forget about the cash, Forget about the clothes 
 Forget about the stash, Forget about the dough 
 Forget about the cars, Forget about the rims 
 Forget about dem stars, Forget about the benz 
 Forget about the big crib, tryna get rich, 
 The big six-fo, plenty dough and tryna sip chrys 
 Forget the cash and chains, that stuff will pass away 
 And you can't take it wit you to yer after days
