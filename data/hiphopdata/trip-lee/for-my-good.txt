You ever felt like stuff never goes your way? 
 Like everything is against you? 
 Well God never promised me he would keep me away from all those trials 
 If I want perfection, I'ma have to wait till later 
 But I ain't trippin' 'cause he has promised 
 That he will work all things together for the good of those who love him 
 And are called according to his purpose 
 Lets praise him for that 
 (Hook - Trip Lee) 
 It's 'bout that time to let them know this how we feel about him 
 It's 'bout that time to let them know this how we feel about him 
 It's 'bout that time to let them know this how we feel about him 
 (Verse 1 - Trip Lee) 
 I know this life may bring pain and a broken heart 
 I've shared my share of tears, plus I got lonesome scars 
 I've had my ups and downs, my rises and my falls 
 So sometimes people ask me how I survive it all 
 I tell 'em 'bout my Lord, let's get it understood 
 My king controls it all and he does it for my good 
 My Savior bought me, then gave me new life, this in his name 
 Now that he got me I know that he'll bring me through the pain 
 (Chorus - Jai) 
 For my good 
 You did it all for my good 
 You'll never put so much on me that I couldn't take it 
 I know I can make it 'cause everything is gon' be OK 
 Say it's all good, it's all good, it's all good 
 God you are are so so good 
 Say it's all good, it's all good, it's all good 
 'Cause you know it's for my good 
 (Hook - Trip Lee) 
 It's 'bout that time to let them know this how we feel about him 
 It's 'bout that time to let them know this how we feel about him 
 It's 'bout that time to let them know this how we feel about him 
 (Verse 2 - Trip Lee) 
 He ain't gon' give me nothing if it ain't good for me 
 Sometimes I ask for something that's seeming good to me 
 But my God is wiser, it's clear he really loves me 
 Sometimes he tells me no, if not it will be ugly 
 How I'm gon' question him, deny my rest in him? 
 He'll give us all things, he gave his son who bled for sin 
 My Lord is more than good, it's clear that he delights to give 
 Good gifts to his sons and daughters, all those who in Christ are his 
 (Chorus - Jai) 
 For my good 
 You did it all for my good 
 You'll never put so much on me that I couldn't take it 
 I know I can make it 'cause everything is gon' be OK 
 Say it's all good, it's all good, it's all good 
 God you are are so so good 
 Say it's all good, it's all good, it's all good 
 'Cause you know it's for my good 
 (Jai) 
 Through all your problems, give it to him 
 You just remember that he's bigger than them 
 There is a purpose, there is a plan 
 You'll be much better than you've ever been 
 (Chorus - Jai) 
 For my good 
 You did it all for my good 
 You'll never put so much on me that I couldn't take it 
 I know I can make it 'cause everything is gon' be OK 
 Say it's all good, it's all good, it's all good 
 God you are are so so good 
 Say it's all good, it's all good, it's all good 
 'Cause you know it's for my good
