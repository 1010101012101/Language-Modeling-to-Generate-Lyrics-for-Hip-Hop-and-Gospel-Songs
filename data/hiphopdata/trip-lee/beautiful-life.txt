(Chorus - V. Rose) 
 Beautiful life inside 
 Living, moving, breathing 
 So let hope arise 
 God knew what he was doing when he gave 
 Beautiful, beautiful life 
 (Verse 1 - Trip Lee) 
 Dear sister, I hear the place you at 
 I know there ain't nothing easy about going through that 
 There's a baby in your womb, but you wasn't trying to do that 
 You'd take it all back if you knew that, but you ain't have a clue that 
 That time with your boyfriend, that late night 
 When you thought you was making love that you would make life 
 And now it's feeling unfair, man it ain't like you ain't got a life 
 Shoot, the time, it really ain't right 
 Can't quite tell you that I understand your pain 
 But I know you shouldn't feel discouraged and ashamed 
 And I know that baby in your stomach ain't a game 
 It's got a heartbeat, he's about to grow a little brain 
 He's dependent on his mama, God already knows his name 
 You're made in God's image and that baby is the same 
 Give him life ... 
 (Chorus - V. Rose) 
 Beautiful life inside 
 Living, moving, breathing 
 So let hope arise 
 God knew what he was doing when he gave 
 Beautiful, beautiful life 
 Beautiful, beautiful life 
 When he gave beautiful, beautiful life 
 Beautiful, beautiful life 
 Let it live 
 (Verse 2 - Trip Lee) 
 Dear brother, I know you prob'ly caught off guard 
 By that seed in her stomach so your heart aches hard 
 Feeling trapped like prisoners behind those bars 
 The hand's been dealt, but you don't wanna take those cards 
 Homie, stop and think about the choice 
 That baby in her womb, she ain't really got a voice 
 So she really needs her daddy to love her and rejoice 
 She's a blessing from the Lord, she don't need to be destroyed 
 Don't abandon her mama, love her and support her 
 She's in pain now too, she needs someone there for her 
 But don't let her hurt your baby girl alive in the womb 
 'Cause homie, you'll be looking in her eyes pretty soon 
 Hey, don't get me wrong, look I agree that we should give women rights 
 That goes for unborn women too, give them life 
 (Chorus - V. Rose) 
 Beautiful life inside 
 Living, moving, breathing 
 So let hope arise 
 God knew what he was doing when he gave 
 Beautiful, beautiful life 
 Beautiful, beautiful life 
 When he gave beautiful, beautiful life 
 Beautiful, beautiful life 
 Let it live 
 (Verse 3 - V. Rose) 
 Dear friends, I know this probably hurts 
 For those of you who wish you would have gave that baby birth 
 But it's too late now 'cause you're child ain't around 
 I know it hurts to your core, that guilt that's weighing you down 
 But I've got good news and some healing for your hurts 
 Christ Jesus came, he descended to the earth 
 But he ain't come for good people, or even the just 
 He came into the world just for sinners like us 
 So yeah, he's really grieved when we take a baby's life 
 'Cause he made 'em, but he came to save us from our plight 
 He came shining light that he could save us from our night 
 Erases all our shame, homie, he can make us right 
 Confess it and believe on the one who paid the cost 
 He died in your place, there's forgiveness at the cross 
 So you could give them life ... 
 (Chorus - V. Rose) 
 Beautiful life inside 
 Living, moving, breathing 
 So let hope arise 
 God knew what he was doing when he gave 
 Beautiful, beautiful life 
 Beautiful, beautiful life 
 When he gave beautiful, beautiful life 
 Beautiful, beautiful life 
 Let it live
