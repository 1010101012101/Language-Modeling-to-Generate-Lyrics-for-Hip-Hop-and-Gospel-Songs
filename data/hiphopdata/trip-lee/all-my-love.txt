I see you watching 
 Do you like what you see? 
 Am I single? 
 Well, sorta kinda maybe 
 What did you have in mind? 
 Your face looks familiar 
 I see you all the time 
 And I can keep you company tonight 
 You ain't gotta tell nobody 
 Ain't nobody else around watching 
 Yeah just say the word and you got it 
 Right here, right now 
 Jay was lonely 
 And he's looking for love on the net 
 A man has needs, what you expect? 
 He looked through all their pages 
 And when he found her man he lost his breath 
 Cause it was love at first sight when they met 
 His heart beating hard 
 She was kinda light skinned, eyes like he liked them 
 Can't fight them feelings when they hit you this hard 
 It's long distance, so he's with her online all the time 
 He's at work but this girl's on his mind all the time 
 He can't wait to see her, she got them banging features 
 When they together he don't mind he gotta pay with Visa 
 His homies warned him "slow down that woman can't complete you" 
 But he's in the game of love he don't want to stay in bleachers 
 Or so he thinks, What I forgot to say is 
 Jay is married and his heart's supposed to be locked away 
 I pray he break it off but he's weakened within 
 And he'd be lost if he can't see her again, he's all in 
 Baby come here 
 'Cause I got what do you need 
 And you want it, you want it 
 Come see me again 
 'Cause I've been waiting for you since morning 
 And I promise all my love 
 Is sitting here waiting for you just come get it, get it 
 All my love 
 Is sitting here waiting for you just come get it 
 Hey he ain't never seen a face like hers plus her waist right 
 Can't fight the urge, he always met her at the same site 
 His boy told him tell his wife 'cause this ain't right 
 But he was too afraid, she finally caught him and they fight 
 Words exchanged she like "what's this charge have you been cheating 
 Have you been seeing some other broads?" 
 He's kinda trapped now and so he backs down 
 He's feeling like he should spill all the facts now 
 And so he tells her 'bout his different lover 
 And his obsession about how he's always eyeing pictures of her 
 It's an addiction it's wicked he want to fix it 
 But the feeling is in him, he's really driven he starts to wonder 
 Is this worth it? 'Cause his wife said he gotta choose 
 She like, "It's her or me your family you bout to lose" 
 Now Jay got the blues, he wants to scream 
 'Cause he love that pretty woman on the screen 
 She like 
 Baby come here 
 'Cause I got what do you need 
 And you want it, you want it 
 Come see me again 
 'Cause I've been waiting for you since morning 
 And I promise all my love 
 Is sitting here waiting for you just come get it, get it 
 All my love 
 Is sitting here waiting for you just come get it 
 My dude Jay is at a cross roads 
 He felt he had joy and happiness but lost those 
 Feels like a lost soul running down the wrong road 
 "How did I get here?" 
 He's at his all time low 
 And now he's crying out crying out 
 Devastated like, "how she even find me out?" 
 Then he remembered that God he simply can't stomach 
 Our wicked sin and he disciplines to break us of it 
 Now it hits him the depths of the hurt he caused 
 The way he grieved his Lord who hung on that dirty cross 
 The way he hurt his wife with his flirts and perverted flaws 
 He might mess around and lose his family, so he paused 
 He takes his laptop her picture's on the backdrop 
 He smashes it with a hammer then takes the trash out 
 He calls his wife and he's repenting in tears 
 And says he wants to be committed for years 
 And God hears
