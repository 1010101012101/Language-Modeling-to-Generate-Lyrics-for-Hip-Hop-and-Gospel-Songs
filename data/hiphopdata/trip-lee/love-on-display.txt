(Verse 1 - Trip Lee) 
 Lord, I'm so amazed at the way you show your love to us 
 That you ain't stop us in them prophets, you would come to us 
 We sin so much, that feeling 'came numb to us 
 Our hearts lied to us, Lord, please come school us 
 While we pursued fake treasure like a dumb jeweler 
 You planned to redeem man, you would come scoop us 
 Who is man that you would notice us? God, mold us 
 It's pure grace that you would even rest your eyes on us 
 Much less leave the heavens, come and die for us 
 Humbled to the point of death, you would cry for us 
 Bloody sweat, no rest, you would ride for us 
 Took blows, gave you flesh, you were my donor 
 Eternally merciful, never bi-polar 
 You pitied me, took the weight right off of my shoulders 
 Stood in my place, erased the debt in us 
 You showed your love and died while we were yet sinners 
 (Chorus - Andy Mineo) 
 Nothing in my hands I bring 
 Simply to the cross I cling 
 And ever since the nails went bang 
 All you people respond and sing 
 Hallelujah 
 You put your love, you put it 
 You put your love on display 
 Hallelujah 
 You put your love, you put it 
 You put your love on display 
 (Verse 2 - Trip Lee) 
 There was nothin' 'bout me that moved you to love 
 I was born unclean in a pool of blood 
 Then you said "live", you really proved your love 
 Christ took my death, my noose has loosened up 
 You saw me full of sin and full of lust, rage 
 You hated my sin because of all your just ways 
 But you pitied me, showered me with much grace 
 I read the good news printed on the front page 
 The headline read "Christ for my lust paid 
 For my sin died, now he was just raised" 
 And the way I knew the grace from you was real sweet 
 Is that you came and died while I was still weak 
 What compassion you showed 
 Displayed your great love with actions, yeah, the facts in the scroll 
 And now I'm like a dirty burlap sack full of gold 
 You put treasure in the clay pot, I'm amped to behold 
 (Chorus - Andy Mineo) 
 Nothing in my hands I bring 
 Simply to the cross I cling 
 And ever since the nails went bang 
 All you people respond and sing 
 Hallelujah 
 You put your love, you put it 
 You put your love on display 
 Hallelujah 
 You put your love, you put it 
 You put your love on display 
 (Andy Mineo) 
 You put your love on display 
 Ever since the day you came 
 Now the only thing to say is hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 Hallelujah 
 (Chorus - Andy Mineo) 
 Nothing in my hands I bring 
 Simply to the cross I cling 
 And ever since the nails went bang 
 All you people respond and sing 
 Hallelujah 
 You put your love, you put it 
 You put your love on display 
 Hallelujah 
 You put your love, you put it 
 You put your love on display
