Verse 1 - Trip Lee: 
 Boy I hopped out the grave good morning 
 I been sleeping for too long I'm yawning 
 Everybody talking trying to see me, disbelief 
 Like how he breathing? He was six feet deep 
 Boy what you saying? Hold up shut your mouth 
 Dead men can't holla, what you talking bout? 
 'Cause once through that door it ain't walking out 
 But let me take you back in time to my coffin now 
 Ooh know you smell it in the air 
 'Cause I been in the grave for too long I swear 
 People crying I'm missing, obituary been written 
 My face pale, they can't tell your boy about to be risen 
 Close the coffin, call the preacher, he so gone 
 It's over can't nobody reach him, say so long 
 But hold on, before you cry and run out 
 I heard somebody coming, saying something yelling, "come out" 
 Pre-Hook: 
 Wake'em! Wake'em Up Now! [x4] 
 Hopped up out the grave, good morning 
 I been sleeping for too long I'm yawning 
 They buried me in black suit, black tie 
 I'm alive and I woke up looking fly 
 So from now on 
 From now on you can call me Lazarus 
 From now on you can call me Lazarus 
 From now on you can call me Lazarus 
 Former dead man walking Lazarus 
 Verse 2 - This'l: 
 They got a missing persons report and they can't find the body 
 Let them tell the story I was shot up at a party 
 Or was I high speeding on a bike 
 Head onto a truck high speeding through a light 
 You can tell it anyway you like 
 End story homie I was raised up by the Christ 
 Dead man walking, green mile 
 Go and check my grave it's been cleaned out 
 Now come and look into my eyes bruh 
 You can see the fire go and tell 'em I'm alive bruh 
 Full of power like a wire bruh 
 God connected to me like some cables and I'm fired up 
 Dead men don't talk, tell lies or truth 
 Dead men don't walk 
 So what that mean for me is that they signed off 
 On my death warrant, but I was raised before it dried off 
 (Pre-Hook) 
 Hopped up out the grave, thriller style 
 They ain't think that He could do it, but he did it now 
 I mean the Captain, the almighty Lord 
 Setting captives free, all aboard, all aboard 
 Can't stop him when he got his mind made up 
 He don't like that grave? Sayonara, see you later 
 He made the blind see and got the lame up 
 So it's no surprise he can raise us 
 Wake them up now 
 Believers when your life is looking tough now 
 When you're at your all time low 
 Don't forget that power that he already showed 
 Hopped up out the grave, good morning 
 I been sleeping for too long I'm yawning 
 They buried me in black suit, black tie 
 I'm alive and I woke up looking fly 
 So from now on
