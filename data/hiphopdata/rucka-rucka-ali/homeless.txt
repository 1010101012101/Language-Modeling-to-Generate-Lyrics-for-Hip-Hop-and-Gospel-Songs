 This one goes out to the *real* Americans! 
 I live in the street 
 I live in a box 
 I got me some keys 
 But don't got a door! 
 I eat Mickey D's 
 Right off of the floor 
 Outside of the store 
 In the parking lot 
 (x2) 
 So if you're white (Throw!) 
 Some change... 
 Because y'all balling like bigshots 
 So if you're white (Throw!) 
 Some change... 
 Because I live in a bus stop 
 (x2) 
 I'm covered in lice 
 In lice 
 In lice 
 In lice 
 I live with my lice 
 My lice 
 My lice 
 My lice 
 Never mind cicadas they be crawling on my face, I hate it 
 8 or 9 or 10 I ate a couple on a plate today 
 Safe to say I blazed away my savings, I'm amazed, but hey 
 Fill me up some tonic and a drop of orange Gatorade 
 Maybe I can take some baking soda and some cane and make a 
 Shake-and bake and take it to my lady for a little date 
 Cook us up some tater tots and look us up what day it's 'bout to 
 Rain and maybe we can raid the basement of a baby's place 
 Living day to day is great, greater than some grated bacon 
 Scraped up off the ground that's been around there since like '88 
 Ate a couple steaks today, scraped them off the road 'cause they were 
 Stuck inside the body of a dog that met its maker 
 They can take away my Lakers tickets, 'cause they fake 
 But they can never take away my God forsaken salt and pepper shakers! 
 Let me get some change, you crackers gon' get paid 
 Just Sit around and talk about how the office should be painted 
 I live in the street 
 I live in a box 
 I got me some keys 
 But don't got a door! 
 I eat Mickey D's 
 Right off of the floor 
 Outside of the store 
 In the parking lot 
 So if you're white (Throw!) 
 Some change... 
 'Cause y'all be balling like bigshots 
 So if you're white (Throw!) 
 Some change... 
 Because I live in a bus stop 
 (x2) 
 I live with my lice 
 Heads up, you better duck, swinging fists like I don't give a fuck 
 'Cause I'm drunk, brown-baggin' is very necessary 
 So hairy people think I'm scary, sleeping in the cemetery 
 Cold as fuck, 'cause the shelter gave Ruck the last bunk 
 So I'm stuck eating garbage out the damn truck 
 Ally cat for a snack seven days a week 
 Only gold plaque I got is on my teeth, buyin' crack, 'cause it's cheap 
 Hold the record for nastiest feet 
 Stuck up Mickey D's for a double cheese with a fake piece 
 Tried to be Bruce Lee 'n' got a ride home from the police 
 Real drunk, humpin' tree stumps to get a nut, and yeah I got 
 Herpes, so what, lemme get a cigarette, 'cause 
 Ain't had a shower in 12 weeks, and that's late 
 I've been sleeping on 15 Mile and Orchard Lake 
 Girls be like "Words, you smell bad" I'm like 
 "Bitch I live in a fucking trash can!" 
 You know, I'm a soulja, drink a case of King Cobra 
 Might weeble and wobble, but won't fall down 
 Looking shitty like Detroit City from 6 Mile down 
 Reverse paparazzi, I watch the watchers watch me 
 'Cause I jump over shells like Mario and Luigi 
 Biatch! 
 I live in the street 
 I live in a box 
 I got me some keys 
 But don't got a door! 
 I eat Mickey D's 
 Right off of the floor 
 Outside of the store 
 In the parking lot 
 So if you're white (Throw!) 
 Some change... 
 Because y'all balling like bigshots 
 So if you're white (Throw!) 
 Some change... 
 Because I live in a bus stop 
 (x2) 
 I'm covered in lice 
 In lice 
 In lice 
 In lice 
 I live with my lice 
 My lice 
 My lice
