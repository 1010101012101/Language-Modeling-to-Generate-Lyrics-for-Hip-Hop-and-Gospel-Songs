Welcome! 
 Youtube take my video down and say 
 "Oh no it's not cause your Chinese" 
 But every time I say AIDS and Russians in the same sentence 
 It's get deleted 
 The government invented AIDS 
 And gave it too youtube and said 
 "Here give this too rucka" 
 This song is called 
 "Me no rikey youtube part 2: 
 No more DJ nice guy" 
 I come here from Red China 
 Cause internet there is controlled by 
 Men with vagina 
 And youtube say 
 "Oh hello 
 Welcome to America 
 We like Chinese people 
 So come make yourself comfortable" 
 But then they were like 
 "Hold up rucka ali we didn't mean for people to like you more then me" 
 If I was nigahiga 
 Or youtube freddy 
 Then I could say whatever I want 
 But since I'm rucka rucka 
 The thugs at youtube 
 Take all my videos down 
 They hate me cause 
 They're racist and I'm kind of brown 
 They tell me I can't say things like 
 Ding ching chang chong 
 They fuck me everyday 
 With their dicks in my butt 
 "What the fuck" 
 Grow some nuts and balls people 
 You hate me 'cause I tell you what you know 
 Youtube please tell me why you did this 
 Why you take my song 
 I bring your shitty website business 
 Count them 40 million 
 I bring Chinese food too the table 
 And try to be your friend 
 If I was signed to major label 
 You'd say "oh hello come in have a blow job" 
 I'm pissed off you don't like me 
 And next time I have 
 Some rice crispies 
 And youtube say 
 "Hey can I have some" 
 I will tell you too fuck off 
 You won't get no cereal 
 Youtube is kind of racist 
 They're breaking my balls 
 I think they're all just angry at asian people 
 They took this fuckin' nation from native people 
 Then they tried taking Beijing from from west Vietnam 
 Give it back to Hong Kong 
 Listen 
 Now I talk like "Ching Chang Chong" 
 And I've seen King Kong 
 Back when it was in theaters 
 And Youtube cellphone kept ringing 
 So I missed the thing 
 With the monkey's penis 
 I think that I might move to Korea 
 Cause there I could have a singing career 
 Cause over there Kim Jung Il made it clear 
 Youtube is against the law 
 We should do that here 
 Yeah 
 Youtube hates me 
 'Cause I won't obey the white man's law 
 They want me too just stop singing 
 And build them another railroads 
 But I won't stop making songs 
 I'm the one that calls the shots 
 Did we give up when China bombed us 
 Wait that's next year 
 Err 
 Youtube just hates black people 
 They treat us yellow people like we're chopped liver 
 Youtube take away all my dang videos 
 But it's okay 'cause they get reloaded 
 By twelve year olds 
 I'm only gonna make fun 
 Of many more people 
 There are so many cultures all over the world 
 And I have only made songs about 3 or 4 
 Youtube will have too say "Please" 
 If they want me too stop 
 Say pleeeeeease 
 Buy my song on iTunes 
 One dollar
