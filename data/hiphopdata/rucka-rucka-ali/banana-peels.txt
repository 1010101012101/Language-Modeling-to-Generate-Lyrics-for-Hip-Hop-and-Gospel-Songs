I don't think cocaine has ever gotten anybody killed 
 And little kids with guns, don't even seem that bad to me 
 Cancer won't kill anyone 
 I ain't scared of nicotine 
 (With meth I'm do-ooh-ooh-wn) 
 No one but gay people in Africa have HIV 
 And I'm not black so 
 No chance of a heart attack or nothing 
 Oh no 
 The swine flu don't matter 
 I ain't Mexican 
 (Why is Michael Jackson wearing a mask?!) 
 I ain't of a holocaust! 
 No one would ever wanna hurt a Je-e-e-e-w 
 There's only one thing I'm scared of... 
 I just don't wanna slip on... 
 Banana peels! 
 And I feel 
 It's a big deal 
 Why you dumbasses leave your... 
 Banana Peels! 
 On the street 
 It's a bad idea 
 (People fall every day die) 
 When I slip outside on them banana peels 
 It makes me mad 
 If I knew left there 
 Then it would it be gunshot blasts! 
 Tell your friends: 
 Throw it in the trash or something (something) 
 I roll with some bad people, 
 And we strapped with guns and shit. 
 I don't wanna cut your ass! 
 And when them peels on the floor 
 Then I'ma fucking know that it's you 
 Yours people gonna be dying slow 
 (While I slap your bitch with a...) 
 Banana peel! 
 Yous getting killed! 
 I ain't gonna chill! 
 Why you dumbasses leave your banana peels 
 On the street... 
 Better go and tell Obama! 
 Get the bomb, 
 And kill them farmers, 
 That are growing bananas out in Nicaragua 
 Or Pakistan 
 Or fucking China 
 Get them for the pain they've caused us... 
 Billions die everyday and that ain't right 
 I wrote this song so litterbugs know I ain't scared to fight 
 Don't make me kill your kids and wife 
 'Cause I don't want no one to slip on... 
 Banana peels... banana peels... banana peels 
 Why you dumbasses leave your 
 Banana peels... banana peels... banana peels 
 Ain't you faggots ever of karma? 
 You leave the peel there on the floor (on the floor) 
 You thinking about no one but you 
 And then your cousin comes along (your cousin comes along) 
 And breaks his skull 'cause he slipped on your... 
 Banana peels! 
 And I feel it's a big deal 
 Why you dumbasses leave your banana peels 
 On the street 
 It's a bad idea 
 Better go and tell Obama! 
 Get the bomb and kill them farmers! 
 That are growing bananas out in Nicaragua! 
 Or Pakistan! 
 Or fuckin' China! 
 Get 'em for the pain that they've caused us. 
 Whoa-ooh-whoooo-ooh 
 Better go and get your banana peels 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh 
 Banana peels 
 I never had to bring Michael Jackson into this one. 
 It was kind of uncalled for. 
 Whoa-whoa-ooh-ooh
