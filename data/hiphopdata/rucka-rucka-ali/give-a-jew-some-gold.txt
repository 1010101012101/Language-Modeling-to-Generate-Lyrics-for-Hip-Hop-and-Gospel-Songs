This next song is by someone who calls himself Sol-Soldier Boy Tell Them? 
 I don't really understand this kind of music 
 Everybody dancing suddenly is having sex on the dance floor? 
 Hey man, I don't really get Jews 
 Always tryin'a jip you 
 Only kind of Jew I know is one, and that's a rich Jew 
 Always tryin'a rip you 
 I never miss a frisk 
 That's when they get together and cut off a baby's dong 
 I just think it's wrong 
 He'll need it later on (Later on) 
 Give a Jew some gold 
 Even just to hold 
 He'll probably get it sold (Get it sold) 
 They be, always be conspiring 
 Even Barbara Streisand 
 They do 9-11? 
 They got so much money 
 I just wonder why 
 They killed the son of God 
 Nailed him to a cross 'cause he wouldn't be a doctor, lawyer 
 Married him a boy, or 
 Now every time you see a Jew, he'll do you taxes for ya 
 I missed the Bar Mitzvah, it made me feel so guilty that I 
 "You didn't come to my Bar Mitzvah, what did I ever do to you? " 
 Hey man, I don't really get Jews 
 Always tryin'a jip you 
 Only kind of Jew I know is one, and that's a rich Jew 
 Always tryin'a rip you 
 I never miss a frisk 
 That's when they get together and cut off a baby's dong 
 I just think it's wrong 
 He'll need it later on (Later on) 
 Give a Jew some gold 
 Even just to hold 
 He'll probably get it sold (Get it sold) 
 They be, always be complaining 
 All about they problems 
 Everything they got ain't enough, they want more of it 
 Always gettin' money, takin' it and double it 
 They got damn country, probably made of money 
 They own all the banks and the media 
 Now every time I see them, they eatin on Chinese food 
 I hate 'em, they Pagan 
 They won't even eat bacon 
 "It's much too expensive, and besides it gives me gas" 
 Hey man, I don't really get Jews 
 Always tryin'a jip you 
 Only kind of Jew I know is one, and that's a rich Jew 
 Always tryin'a rip you 
 I never miss a frisk 
 That's when they get together and cut off a baby's dong 
 I just think it's wrong 
 He'll need it later on (Later on) 
 Give a Jew some gold 
 Even just to hold 
 He'll probably get it sold (Get it sold) 
 "Hello, this is K-Mart, how can I help you? " 
 "Hello, this is Seymour Shwartz, who are you? 
 "John" 
 "Yeah, John it was you, I bought your air conditioner yesterday 
 It won't start, I already took two sips of Mancheivitz so I can't drive back over there 
 I'm shmitzen like a shmotz over here, how do you suppose I get my air conditioner 
 Working, after I bought it from you and mesugana over there, you wouldn't 
 Accept my coupons" 
 "Sir, we don't sell air conditioners, it's March" 
 Hey man, I don't really get Jews 
 Always tryin'a jip you 
 Only kind of Jew I know is one, and that's a rich Jew 
 Always tryin'a rip you 
 I never miss a frisk 
 That's when they get together and cut off a baby's dong 
 I just think it's wrong 
 He'll need it later on (Later on) 
 Give a Jew some gold 
 Even just to hold 
 He'll probably get it sold (Get it sold) 
 So this is hippy-hop? 
 Not bad, back in my day the hippies played a whole different kind of music 
 It was much more peaceful, they didn't shoot each other or call each other names or anything 
 A lot of them did drugs, most of them were anti-semitic
