 Child support 
 For my kid 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 I got a [?] 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 I got some pot, 
 For my kid 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 I got a [?] 
 When you see me up at Chuck E. Chesses, feeding my kids 
 And I'll be buyin' them some fries and a couple of ribs 
 While my baby mama tellin' me what she wanted more 
 "I need a [?] check, and a mothafucking child support!" 
 She want my money all day 
 And she gets her hair fixed 
 She wants my chrome piece of change 
 And she gets her nails fixed 
 'Cause when [?] shot [?], and they need braces on they teeth 
 And I can't buy a X-Box for [?] and [?]! 
 Oh no! 
 I let my Nikes go! 
 Oh no! 
 I let my Nikes go! 
 And my baby mama cryin' 'cause she know that I'm broke 
 She says, 
 Damn, Rucka Sucka! 
 I'mma take you to court 
 Got these kids waitin' on me 
 Ain't got no money 
 And these kids ain't mine 
 We could take them to[?]'s 
 These twenty kids ain't mine 
 I ain't got no damn trash tonight 
 Why you givin' me crap tonight? 
 Can we eat somethin' fresh tonight? 
 You cook the same trash everynight! 
 I come home, and dinner is pizza? 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 I got a [?] 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 I got some pot, 
 For my kid 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 I got some pot 
 For my kid 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 Asia, Konicha! 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 Laweesha, malaria 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 (?], [?) 
 Child support 
 For my kid 
 You know who this is 
 It's yo baby's mama 
 I need a [?] check and a motherfuckin' child support 
 Don't even tell me you've been messin' around with them pretty ass bitches 
 You know who this is 
 OK, Rucka!
