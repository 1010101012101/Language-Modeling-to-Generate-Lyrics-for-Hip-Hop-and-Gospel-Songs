I saw Kanye, the gay fish 
 Take the mic from 
 Taylor Swift 
 At the MTVMAs 
 Throws a tantrum every year 
 What's he crying about now? 
 His haircut looks like my nutsack 
 I think he's finally lost his mind 
 He made this country singer cry 
 I'd love to smash Taylor's vagina 
 She's over eighteen years, all right? 
 He's some kind of male diva 
 Musical genius 
 Greatest mothafucka since Jesus 
 He's just too cool to stay his ass seated 
 Drinking Hennessy since Kelly and Regis 
 Keep his whack ass off of the TV 
 Now I see Taylor Swift walking off and leaving 
 Bring her back out 
 I was starting to imagine her mouth upon Katy Perry's ass, 
 Till Kanye starts speakin' 
 Please tell me what kinda shit is that? 
 Remember back stage he was gettin' all mad 
 Sayin' that MTV doesn't care about black people? 
 Isn't there a black guy in the Gym Class Heroes? 
 Herro! 
 I've been seein' them PSA's 
 Sayin' don't say something is gay 
 Wanda Sykes was in on this 
 I though it was kinda gay 
 I can't read good so I shout, 
 "Patrick Swayze, where'd you go?" 
 Making Red Dawn 2 in heaven 
 Keep an eye on Michael Jackson 
 Keep him away from Ben Savage 
 If he's not dead then I'm impressed 
 We all say words like "retard" 
 But we don't mean to demean 
 Kids that have special needs 
 We just need a word 
 And it's the greatest word we got 
 To describe vegans and members of PETA 
 When I say "faggot" 
 You might think that it's terrible 
 But I don't mean to hurt your feelings, homosexual 
 It's a word I need just for people in general, 
 Like the lead singer of Interpol 
 Cynical people think that it's hate speech 
 They can all lick me where the Good Lord lays me 
 The color of your skin doesn't matter to me 
 And the colors of a fascist don't change 
 Just 'cause you call him a bleeding heart... 
 Christians really miss Jesus 
 They blame the Jews for killing him 
 I choose to blame the Jews as well 
 More for industrial things 
 Psych! 
 Just playin', don't get all mad 
 Don't go call Gloria Allred 
 I got no good goddamn money 
 Go sue someone that's good for it 
 I live in my momma's basement 
 I never had to pay no rent 
 Where would I be without racism? 
 That's like saying "Where would 
 Mindless Self Indulgence 
 be without girls that were molested as children?" 
 If I can't make fun of Asians, 
 You feminist bitches aren't free to say "Fuck Sarah Palin" 
 And I can't even say I wanna FUCK Sarah Palin 
 David Letterman couldn't be funny if you paid him 
 I wrote this song 
 So I could get laid with Taylor 
 And burn Kanye like the witches in Salem 
 You want racist? 
 I'll give you racist 
 The human race is heading for the days of enslavement 
 I watch in amazement, 
 From my momma's basement 
 You closet cases going ape shit 
 Over gay shit 
 Remember this face, 'cause I'm gettin' me a facelift 
 Reverse 
 Michael Jackson 
 , reverse celeb races 
 So I can say shit without pushin' daisies, like Swayze 
 Lady's chicken head ways don't faze me 
 99 problems, and 
 Jay-Z 
 will hate this 
 Have you ever had shoes without shoelaces? 
 Have you ever seen Jews without Jew faces? 
 Rucka, I don't mean to cut you off 
 And I'll let you finish, 
 But Weird Al is better than you! 
 And doesn't use hatred 
 Well, I do, so you can suck my fuckin' dick naked 
 I'm tired of you, and fuck music, I hope I don't make it 
 And fuck your crew [bleep] child porn tradin' faggots!
