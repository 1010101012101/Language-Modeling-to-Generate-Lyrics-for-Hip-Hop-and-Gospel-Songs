 Iâ€™m a pedo 
 I tell you where it's from 
 Africa 
 That's from where Ebola comes 
 West side 
 It hides in the suitcase 
 Two days later 
 It lands in USA 
 I get it from my girlfriend 
 And give it to my dad 
 I catch it on the subway 
 And leave it in the cab 
 I eat it at Subway 
 Drink it at Starbucks 
 Ebola's everywhere 
 And I give no fucks 
 They scared 
 It's bad 
 Ebola's gonna kill us all dead 
 They mad 
 How'd this happen 
 Gotta make sure that nobody else gets it 
 I'm sorry but I have it and you have it 
 Or you'll get it so forget it 
 Don't sweat it 
 Just let it be 
 I'm telling you Ebola's not the enemy 
 Listen 
 I have Ebo 
 And you have Ebo 
 And we have Ebo 
 Everybody has Ebo 
 Selena has Ebo 
 Justin has Ebo 
 Taylor has Ebo 
 Jesus has Ebo 
 Ebola 
 Every shitty little village in Africa 
 Has Ebola 
 Every city in America is getting it now 
 Just go with it bruh 
 Airports 
 Check if he's Black 
 He could have Ebola 
 So send him back 
 In fact keep an eye 
 On the Black Eye Peas 
 Mostly Black and Guy 
 Don't worry about Peas 
 And the Cosbys 
 Could have Ebola 
 Also Oprah 
 Let's just close up Detroit 
 Till this crisis is contained 
 Don't let the Obamas 
 On the plane 
 'Cause they black 
 They could have Ebola 
 Might as well also 
 Watch for Ayrabs 
 If they have a brown face 
 We'll keep 'em safe 
 In Guantanamo Bay 
 I'm sorry everybody for the drama 
 But we're gonna get Ebola 
 If we let black people in 
 Ebola's not a country in Africa 
 It's the whole continent 
 I have Ebo 
 You have Ebo 
 Obama has Ebo 
 Kanye has Ebo 
 Will Smith has Ebo 
 Tupac has Ebo

 Magic Johnson has Ebo 
 And AIDS

 Every shitty little village in Africa 
 Has Ebola 
 Every city in America is getting it now 
 Just go with the flow 
 You have Ebo 
 Your mom has Ebo 
 Your Uncle Tom has Ebo 
 Ariana has Ebo
