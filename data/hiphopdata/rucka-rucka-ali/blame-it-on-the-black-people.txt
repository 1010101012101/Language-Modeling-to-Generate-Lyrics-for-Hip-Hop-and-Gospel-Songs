Blame it on the black people 
 When they in the burbs 
 Cops get scared 
 Cops pull 'em over 
 Make 'em sit out on the curb 
 Search the car for crack 
 Blame it on the black 
 You say they usually broke (broke) 
 You say they usually deal coke (coke) 
 When your movie sells go 
 You think it's 'cause they bootleg DVD's 
 When a white girl is knocked up (knocked up) 
 You blame a brother, but he locked up (locked up) 
 And someone said they saw him steal a car 
 And they said he had a gun 
 Yeah 
 Up in the theater 
 I could hear people 
 Speaking (speaking 
 Can't we go outside, if we're gonna make a phone call? 
 I could hear screaming on your phone 
 I found a gun with no serial number 
 Wonder, was it a Asian or was it a Jew? 
 Who peeled the number off the gun 
 Could be either one 
 When they in the burbs 
 Cops get scared 
 Cops pull 'em over 
 Make 'em sit out on the curb 
 Plant the car with crack 
 Blame it on the black people 
 They said on the news, 
 "Have you seen any black male, baggy clothes, in his mid-twenties?" 
 Blame it on the black people 
 Blame it on the black 
 They rolling in a caprice 
 Get rolled by the police 
 The cop says 
 "Sir please keep your hands on the wheel I don't wanna die" 
 The man says 
 "What did I do? 
 "The cop says I got a gun dude" 
 And I got me a dog in my other car 
 So don't give me no problems 
 Cops always thinking 
 Black folks are stealing 
 Because they can't see inside they car 
 Cause the windows are so dark 
 Why the windows tinted up so dark 
 They pulled 'em over 
 In the Range Rover 
 OK I'm kidding 
 They be driving in a 88 Pontiac Bonneville 
 With a golden grill 
 When they in the burbs 
 Cops get scared 
 Cops pull 'em over 
 Make 'em sit out on the curb 
 Plant the car with crack 
 Blame it on the black people 
 They said on the news 
 "Have you seen any black male, baggy clothes, in his mid-twenties?" 
 Blame it on the black people 
 Blame it on the black 
 Man you know it ain't cool 
 When someone gets shot 
 They always get blamed 
 And it's wrong 
 And when something goes missing (They blame the black guy) 
 I find it interesting (But I don't ask why) 
 When you get shot up in 'Cheego 
 If it's someone we know 
 You and me we can go blame some black people 
 I know that it's me 
 But it's easier than finding put who's guilty 
 So they blame a black guy 
 Why? 
 Now we got a little kid that didn't do nothing nothing behind bars 
 (Baby behind bars) 
 And I ask you why (And I ask you why) 
 We gotta blame someone white 
 Aight 
 But instead we blame him 
 Now he's sitting in the pen since he fifteen 
 Just cause the color of his skin 
 Like fuck you wiggers 
 When they in the burbs 
 Cops get scared 
 Cops pull 'em over 
 Make 'em sit out on the curb 
 Plant the car with crack 
 Blame it on the black 
 They said on the news 
 "Have you seen any black male, baggy clothes, in his mid-twenties?) 
 Blame it on the black people 
 Blame it on the black 
 And now I know O.J was framed 
 And he didn't do a thing 
 And Michael Jackson was an outstanding good guy 
 Until he turned white 
 And now I know Kobe is the man 
 And if his lady fan 
 Didn't wanna get slammed 
 Then shouldn't have come said hi 
 Why we blame the black guy
