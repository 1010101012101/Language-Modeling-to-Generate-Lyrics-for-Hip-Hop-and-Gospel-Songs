I like to blow myself up into small pieces (hey) 
 Sometimes I'm too busy, so I strap bombs on my kids (I love you) 
 I like to kill Jewish people, a Sunni would be fun 
 And that's why I'm hooked up with dynamite in Turkistan 
 Ro, ro oh oh oh, ro, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 It's my Jihad, 
 I do for my God 
 Ro, ro oh oh oh, ro, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 And you've never seen a club, until this one blows up (poof) 
 My Jihad, 
 Yeah Jihad, 
 Me at hello, 
 Now let's blow this place! 
 It will take us to Muhammed 
 Hurry up, 
 Give the boxcutter to me, 
 While I flow this plane, 
 Into someone's fucking office! 
 I blow, blow, blow this place, 
 I blow up this place 
 J-J-Jihad 
 I blow, blow, blow this place, 
 I blow up this place 
 J-J-Jihad 
 I like to blow myself up in the crowded street (hey) 
 I'm angry 'cause I was circumcised at thirteen (ah) 
 Mustn't forget to strap my baby, with a gun (waah) 
 I'm gonna get that Arab money, when I'm in Heaven (cha-ching) 
 Ro, ro oh oh oh, ro, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 It's my Jihad, 
 I do for my God 
 Ro, ro oh oh oh, ro, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 'Cause I'm the bomb 
 No, really, I'm the bomb! 
 Yeah Jihad, 
 Yeah Jihad, 
 Me at hello, 
 Now let's blow this place! 
 It will take us to Muhammed 
 Hurry up, 
 Give the boxcutter to me, 
 While I flow this plane, 
 Into someone's fucking office! 
 I blow, blow, blow this place, 
 I blow up this place 
 J-J-Jihad 
 I blow, blow, blow this place 
 I blow up this place 
 J-J-Jihad 
 (Derka derka) 
 I would like to blow myself up, 
 In the presence of civilians 
 Then I'll have a pile of gold and, 
 Then I can rape 72 virgins 
 I strap my children with a bomb, 
 They can't get off it 
 Then I tell them, "See those people, 
 They will give you some chocolate!" 
 Yeah, Jihad 
 Yeah, Jihad 
 Me at hello, 
 Now let's blow this place! 
 It will take us to Muhammed 
 Hurry up 
 Give the boxcutter to me 
 While I flow this plane, 
 Into someone's fucking office! 
 Yeah, Jihad 
 Yeah, Jihad 
 Me at hello, 
 Now let's blow this place! 
 It will take us to Muhammed 
 Hurry up 
 Give the boxcutter to me 
 While I flow this plane, 
 Into someone's fucking office! 
 J-J-Jihad! 
 J-J-Jihad! 
 J-J-Jihad! 
 J-J-Jihad! 
 J-J-Jihad!
