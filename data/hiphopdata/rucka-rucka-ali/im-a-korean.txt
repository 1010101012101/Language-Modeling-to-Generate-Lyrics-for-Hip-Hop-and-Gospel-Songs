 I'm a Korean... 
 Oh hello remember me? 
 My name is DJ Not Nice 
 You might remember me from my last record, "Ching Chang Chong" 
 You made me very rich 
 Now I roll in American money 
 I'm a Korean 
 And I like my Chinee food cooked right 
 'Cause they're not giving me the good rice 
 And the dyke giving me my food looks like a lesbian 
 I don't like how my beef pork looks like 
 And the last time I eat your food I 
 Got the rice chicken beef tofu now I poop while I'm peein' 
 And you might not believe I could fight 
 I'm a white belt, but I have two stripes 
 I don't like all you little blue-eyed dumb white Europeans 
 I would just like to drink my Bud Light 
 Maybe bomb a couple things in Hawaii 
 And blow up the countries I don't like 'cause I'm a Korean 
 I'm not that nice 
 I build a bomb 
 Then pick a country 
 And blow it up 
 I work for NASA 
 We look at stars 
 You know Apollo? 
 That movie is good! 
 I talk like Ching Chang Chong 
 Why do you drop on me so napalm? 
 I've been trained to kill with my Tae Kwon Do 
 And my whole continent is a dry cleaning store 
 (B-b-b-b-b-b-b-Bonzai!) 
 I like to play Magic cards 
 You heard of China? I was in charge 
 Of Chinatown... in Vietnam 
 I'm still around... 
 You can come through to play 
 When I play poker I just throw all my chips in 
 Herro, I'm yerrow, just like Homer Simpson 
 I smoke coke, it's fun! You think I'm joking, mon? 
 I made a lot of money from Pokémon! 
 I'm a Korean 
 I think Michael Jackson's a good guy 
 I don't mind if he sleeps with young guys 
 'Cause in my country, we can touch young guys on their penis 
 And my wife is 13 and cooks my 
 Macaroni and cheese so good, I 
 Got her out on the street for a good, good price 
 Ten years ago 
 I'm not gonna lie 
 I like it rough 
 Hillary Clinton, let's get it on 
 I have a missile 
 It's very small 
 It's in my pants 
 I can't get it up! 
 I bomb New York 
 Better luck (Next time!) 
 You heard of London? 
 Not anymore! 
 I bomb Iran! 
 Oops! That's Japan! (Not again!) 
 I made a goof... 
 Now I gotta start again... 
 I roll the world up in a ball like Katamari 
 If I bomb your crib, yep, sorry! 
 I'm a ninja warrior! 
 I went to Harvard! 
 I bomb Pearl Harbor! 
 I want the whole world to know that I'm powerful! 
 나는 작은 음경이야! 
 Everyone! 
 To the Floor 
 We all gonna die! 
 Put your head between your legs and 
 Say koniichiwa! 
 Death to all! 
 Fuck the world! 
 'Cause I like 2Pac! 
 Now the world must stop! 
 'Cause of my small cock! 
 One day you'll say 
 "Why is everyone dead? 
 Why didn't we just do what Kim Jong Il said?" 
 Now we are all slaves 
 Monkeys run this place 
 It's Planet Of The Apes... 
 I'm a Korean 
 And I'm not gonna beef with Suge Knight 
 Because I think that if he heard my 
 My 2Pac parody, he'd find me and tell me I'm stealing 
 Hurry up, take a picture of me dangling from the balcony! 
 ...And I'd like my Chinee food cooked right 
 I don't like Japanese or the Thai 
 I just want to see the whole world die 'cause 
 I'm a Korean...
