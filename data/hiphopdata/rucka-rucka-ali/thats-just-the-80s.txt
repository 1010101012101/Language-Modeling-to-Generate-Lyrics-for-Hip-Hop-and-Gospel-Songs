This song's by somebody called Tupac Shakur 
 I've never heard of him, 
 But I guess he's got a movie comin' out, 
 Called "Notorius", so... 
 Let's go back to the 1980's! 
 Yeah, come on, come on 
 It's 1980, 
 I wake up in the morning, wearing Spandex 
 Is John Lennon living or his ass get dish? 
 I got a GameBoy in my fanny pack 
 It's goes well with my member's only jacket 
 That Captain Planet is a hero 
 That show brought my IQ down to zero 
 Cast of Different Strokes gettin' death threats 
 Couple less, open your mouth for the Pez dispenser 
 Donatelo and his ninjas gettin' down karate 
 Three ninjas whoopin' ass with Mr. Eogy 
 I guess Bob Marley's dead 
 But we still got a million white dudes with dreads 
 And we'll probably see OJ sent to jail, 
 Before we see a black president 
 What's a dude gonna do with a Rubix cube? 
 And someone tell me what the hell is a Power Ranger? 
 Can't a brother get some Cosby's? 
 Stephanie got the bullet off of Uncle Jessie 
 I wanna go back to watch a movie 
 With the rat-at-at-pack 
 That's the 80's 
 That's just the 80's 
 We ain't ever heard of AIDS 
 That's just the 80's 
 What's crack? 
 That's just the 80's 
 We ain't ever heard of AIDS 
 What's crack?
