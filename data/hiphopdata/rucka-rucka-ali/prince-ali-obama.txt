 Obama: 
 Make way for my Denali 
 Make way, I'm Bengali 
 Since I've been out of the White House, I've been 
 Standing in line at the welfare office 
 Smoking a blunt with the cast of Entourage 
 (That's good shit, Turtle) 
 Finally I could stop with the while boy lies 
 So here's what I'm really like 
 It's Ali, House of Saudi, Barry Obama 
 Drivin' me a stolen Audi that belongs to me 
 I get arrested sometimes 
 My vest contains a bomb 
 I was born in North Vietnam and in Bali 
 Its Ali, I'm a Sunni from Alabama 
 Eating me a bucket of drums from KFC 
 Trump: 
 Ay who the hell is this guy? 
 Obama: 
 I'm you with an expensive tie 
 Still using White House wi-fi on my 3G 
 Choir: 
 He's a pimp standing on the street corner 
 Obama: 
 Uh but I live here 
 Jinping 
 He's a black guy, please call the police 
 Obama: 
 Uh I ask that you don't 
 Redneck: 
 Hes a Moslim preparin' my shawarma 
 Obama: 
 Paid by big Pharma 
 I'm a piece of African radical Black Panther Arab-American dream 
 It's Ali smokin' some tree, Daddy Obama 
 ( 
 Choir: 
 Bitch better have my money) 
 Nigerian prince stealing your identity 
 I spread the word of Allah 
 In a stolen Impala 
 I was born in North Africa, probably 
 On the streets mowing down fuckin' honkeys 
 (Move bitch, get out the way) 
 I was Bin Laden's tribe originally 
 (That's mah nigga, that's mah nigga) 
 I'm jihading around on a donkey 
 I was born in East Pakistan 
 Uzbekistan 
 Kazakhstan 
 Afghanistan 
 And the ghetto of Haiti 
 In jail 
 Its Ali, at Mickey D's, smokin' a crack rock 
 Can you please pass me the chicken, nigga please 
 From the White House to a tent 
 I'm always late on my rent 
 I'm serving life sentences, smokin' a blunt 
 I'm airplanes crashing in 2001 
 I'm the fear that Americans feeling ever since Abraham Lincoln freed me 
 I'm me 
 Suck my D 
 I need money 
 (Uh I don't like white people)
