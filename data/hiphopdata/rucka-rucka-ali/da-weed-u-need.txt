Weed that you need 
 Ain't from the Chinese 
 Crack's the best 
 Ask your friend for me please 
 Unless you got that motherfuckin' 
 Crista-chronic cut-a-lack 
 Better get my money back 
 Put it back in my hundred stack 
 Flip a track so I get my crack 
 When the fuck we gonna see a free Jamaica 
 I been waiting 25 minutes for a milkshake huh 
 Jamaican red 
 I got Jamaican red 
 Y'all just make me laugh 
 Makin' up names for your shit 
 You're all little kids you all getting jacked 
 You got blueberries? 
 I got six caps in your head 
 My cash stays in my wallet 
 (Watchu got?) 
 I got weed fuck else would I call in 
 S'all good when you in the hood joggin 
 Catch a cap in the back of your noggin 
 End your life and your wife is sobbin 
 Now you're dead and your wife's head is bobbin 
 You got bullets stuck to your palate 
 Smoke crack in the back of Wonton Palace 
 We open for business it's christmas 
 Ain't nobody up in this bitch doing shit kid 
 Wonton crack fried rice is dericious 
 I take it back to my house made of bitches 
 Jackie Chan go wash my dishes 
 Fuck all the bitches

 Better get my money back 
 Put it back in my hundred stack 
 Flip a track so I get my crack 
 They call me Jesus 
 But I turn my water to crack 
 I just spit back the facts 
 And leave no sign of attack 
 Y'all know my uncle Osama 
 Spit in the face of Obama 
 Signed his name after the comma to send yo mama some drama 
 But that shit ain't cool 
 Nigga shit in the pool 
 Chase him down with a bat 
 My man's acting the fool 
 Osama wouldn't last a minute on the streets of detroit 
 He'd get his ass sprayed up straight up 
 By me and my boys 
 Fuck those tallibandit faggot 
 'Cause we takin' it back 
 To the street with phad beats due to public demand 
 Cut Osama like salami 
 Fold him like origami 
 Leave several chapters of a script written only in Kanji 
 Beat him up in the rehab 
 Toss him up like a meatslab 
 Hook him up a toetag and send him back in a bag 
 Where we'll all take turns taking a piss on his face 
 So we can get right back to the American way
