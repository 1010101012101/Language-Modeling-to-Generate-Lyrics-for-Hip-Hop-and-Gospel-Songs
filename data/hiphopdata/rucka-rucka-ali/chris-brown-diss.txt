Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh 
 Rucka Rucka Ali! 
 Pinegrove Records (uh-huh, uh-huh) 
 Serchlite Music droppin' me after this one (uh-huh, uh-huh) 
 I heard about 
 Chris Brown 
 Wrapped his hands around 
 Rihanna 
 's neck, and choked her, left her passed out on the ground 
 Yo Chris, I'm pissed! 
 I'll put you on my hit list 
 Kids look up to you! 
 How you come to this? 
 You know what, man? 
 Biting arms? That's charming! 
 You raised on a barn by your mom? 
 Yeah! 
 Rihanna's got the curves that could stop moving traffic 
 I'mma tap that ass, if it puts me in a casket 
 I heard about Chris Brown 
 He was driving his girl around 
 And then Rihanna threw away his keys 
 'Cause she found hoes on his phone 
 And then Chris Brown bit her arm 
 And choked her till she hit the ground 
 And then he left her there 
 I guess 'cause his ass was scared 
 Chris Brown! 
 If you gonna fight yo girl Rihanna, 
 Hit her somewhere she won't remember 
 With a swift punch upside the head 
 And leave her outside and she'll forget 
 You could've blamed some other ninja 
 Now she's running 'round, sayin' you try to kill her 
 And your ass gettin' locked up in jail 
 With some dudes usin' you for a pillow 
 I know, it's a, damn, shame, them using you for a pillow 
 Here's a book on Malcolm X 
 We can lift weights together 
 Come on, for the next ten years 
 I convert you to Islam 
 Allah, allah, praise him yeah, it's great 
 His apology 
 When they played it on TV 
 Chris was usin' some big words 
 It looked like his ass was scared 
 When Chris Brown goes to jail 
 I think that he will get killed 
 When big dudes come for him 
 He'll try to bite they arm 
 Chris Brown 
 If you gonna fight your girl, Rihanna 
 Here's a syringe with tranquilizer 
 Dope her up good, and she'll forget 
 And leave her locked up inside the crib 
 You could have used this damn syringe 
 And then blamed on some other ninja 
 Now your ass locked up in jail 
 With some big dudes usin' you as a pillow 
 I know, it's a, damn, shame, them using you for a pillow 
 Here's a book on Malcolm X 
 We can lift weights together 
 Come on, for the next ten years 
 I convert you to Islam 
 Allah, Allah, praise him, yeah, it's great 
 I seen Chris on 
 Sesame Street 
 Teachin' kids they ABC's 
 Said "Pligganese" 
 Get these kids away from Chris 
 Right now, Chris is into biting arms 
 Get him away from Elmo! 
 Chris Brown! 
 If your gonna fight your girl Rihanna,
