 Rucka Rucka Ali 
 Oh yeah, very nice! 
 Pinegrove Records 
 Oh, oh, yeah, I like this 
 Serchlite Music, number one is USA 
 Confucius say... 
 It's been so long, 
 Since China first became a place 
 They are so strong, 
 Soon they will enslave the Fillipino race 
 I'm Viet Kong (Kong) 
 And I can hear my people cry 
 I know a thing or two, 
 About kung fu, 
 So kiss your ass good bye! 
 I wanna blow up China-na-na 
 They have sidways vagina-na-na 
 I really don't like China-na-na 
 We need to blow up China-na-na 
 I wanna blow up China-na-na 
 They have sidways vagina-na-na 
 I really don't like China-na-na 
 We need to blow up China-na-na 
 When I go, 
 To get my steak fried rice for two, 
 And it's cold, 
 And it makes me mad, 
 'Cause I paid five, ninety-two 
 Plus tax 
 And you know, 
 The Dalai Lama 
 Is my friend 
 He lives in Detroit, 
 And we boys, 
 And we would like to free Tibet 
 I wanna blow up China-na-na 
 They have sidways vagina-na-na 
 I really don't like China-na-na 
 We need to blow up China-na-na 
 I wanna blow up China-na-na 
 They have sidways vagina-na-na 
 I really don't like China-na-na 
 We need to blow up China-na-na 
 Ninja please, 
 Everybody in the house, 
 Smokes tree 
 I'm Viet Kong, 
 Do I look Chinee? 
 China never pay their Blockbuster fees 
 Ninja please, 
 Everybody in the house,
