If I ran Detroit 
 Even just for a day 
 I'd get my office in the morning 
 Legalize the chronic, and go 
 I'd run some drive-bys 
 And call up some call girls 
 I'd spend a dollar fifty on 'em 
 Then slap some charges on 'em 
 And pardon my big cousin, Kwame 
 If I ran Detroit 
 I think we could have a chance 
 I'd load the streets with cotton candy 
 Some chicken fries convered in ranch 
 I'd give y'all some herbs 
 Put bitches on every curb 
 I would get y'all hooked on phonics 
 And change it to ebonics 
 So everybody can be employed 
 If I ran Detroit 
 I'd walk into people's homes 
 I'd give everybody coke 
 And I'd replace their Five O' Clock with Nuvo 
 I'd pay myself first 
 Then pay my bitches and hoes 
 And if you get paid under the table, 
 I'mma find out and I'm come break your jaw 
 I'll break your balls 
 If I ran Detroit 
 I think we could have a chance 
 I'd load the streets with cotton candy 
 Some chicken fries convered in ranch 
 I'd give y'all some herbs 
 Put bitches on every curb 
 I would get you hooked on phonics 
 And change it to ebonics 
 So everybody can be employed 
 It ain't never too late 
 To get Detroit back on track 
 If you let me be mayor I would govern on crack 
 If you put me in charge, 
 Crips and Bloods 
 would get along 
 But I don't run Detroit 
 And we don't have a chance 
 Detroit is going to hell 
 Oh boy, how I'd love to run Detroit someday 
 I swear I'll have a better plan 
 I'd give y'all some herbs 
 Put bitches on every curb 
 I would get you hooked on phonics 
 And change it to ebonics 
 So everybody can be employed 
 If I ran Detroit
