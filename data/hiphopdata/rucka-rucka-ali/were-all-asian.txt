Oh, herro 
 My name is DJ Not Nice 
 I'm here to end the hate, 
 And bring peace between all the Asian race 
 I mean Korean and Chinese? 
 We're all really the same. 
 I mean, we look the same right? 
 We eat with chopstick? 
 My eyes look like, 
 I'm mad 'cause someone stole my eggroll 
 I'm sad, 'cause my dad, 
 Died fighting for his country's butthole 
 He told me, 
 "Son, who cares what color is your skin? We're all Asian. 
 Some guyslook like Asians, but they're just Mexicans" 
 Oh, okay! 
 I pray that one day, 
 The whole world will be oriental 
 I play video games, 
 I finally beat the second level 
 Stand in the center, 
 And jump on the bosses head, 
 And now he's dead 
 Oh very good, let's play again! 
 The Filipino race, 
 And the Chinese can all be friends 
 'Cause we're all Asian 
 Fuck whoever's not 
 When China gets the bomb, 
 The whole world's eyes will be slanted like ours 
 'Cause if you're not Asian, 
 Suck my yellow cock 
 Oh, let's watch some BBC news 
 Oh, they're talkin' about me! 
 Cool! 
 The kids, 
 In Bournemouth 
 Made fun of someone 'cause he's Asian 
 The principal said, 
 "DJ Not Nice is probably racist" 
 Oh thanks, 
 You're probably gay with AIDS 
 You know Confucius say, 
 If the shoe fits, 
 Steal it from Payless and give it to your kids, 
 For Christmas 
 Herro, herro 
 Come in my store 
 Thank you come again 
 I would like white and black people, 
 If they were Asian 
 So when your teacher shows, 
 My videos to your special ed class, 
 Please no one laugh 
 The Fillipino race (The Fillipine is a place) 
 Knows much more things, 
 Than the Jews and gays 
 So if you go on vacation, 
 Don't go near China 
 You must stand outside city wall 
 The Japanese are fine, 
 And Taiwanese tastes nice 
 But Hawaiians are crossing the line 
 'Cause if they're not Asian, 
 They can, 
 Suck my little cock 
 I will ninja kick you in the nut 
 White people suck, 
 And Jews eat Chinese food too much 
 Black people steal your stuff 
 We will kill everyone but us 
 'Cause if you're not Asian, 
 Then you're, 
 Probably white or black, 
 Or Puerto Rican, or Iraqi 
 So you see my friends, 
 I hope you learned something today 
 From the song that I sing, and my clear message (Nuclear, hehe) 
 That if you're not Asian (From Beijing) 
 Won't be long till you're gone 
 So you can suck on my ding dong 
 'Cause China's building a bomb 
 With a little help from Kim Jung 
 With the money we made from the song, 
 Ching Chang Chong 
 I suggest you get facelift, 
 And take some Kung Fu fight lessons 
 So we might think you're Viet Cong 
 Yeah 
 Ninja
