YouTube took my number one video down! 
 Damn 
 How? 
 Tell me why you suspend my account? 
 Damn 
 Why? 
 (DJ not nice here!) 
 I come on a boat from Red China 
 'Cause they won't give me free speech talk 
 I come to America 
 And get some turn tables 
 And play my song outside drycleaning stores 
 And everyone liking me and they dance so I say ok 
 (I'll make a video for my song ching chang chong) 
 And it was the number one in the USA 
 But suddenly one day 
 The video wasn't there 
 And youtube told me 
 That they decided to take my hate song down 
 Cause people complaining 
 They think that I hate asians 
 What kind of pussy can't tell I'm a clown 
 Clown 
 Damn 
 Youtube take my my number one song down 
 Damn 
 How? 
 I think they still mad about vietnam 
 It's not hate speech 
 Come on it's listed under comedy 
 Why you take my song away 
 Don't you know laughter is the best medicine (except if you have aids) 
 Why you take ching chang chong from me 
 It's not nice to take it away (you take ching chang chong away) 
 If you spent some time with me 
 You would see that I'm ok (so let me tell you about me) 
 My dog is Alaskan 
 My friend is a black man 
 My wife is a dyke and I love everybody in the whole world 
 If you think I'm racist 
 Well you just can't face it 
 That black people are just like me more than you 
 Yeah 
 How about that? 
 You just mad 'cause I have more black friends 
 Than 
 You 
 Little wayne is in the house 
 Everybody come on 
 Damn why they gotta be 
 Mad about some comedy 
 I'm thinking youtube owes rucka a apology 
 Nailed him to a cross with a form of cyber sodomy 
 We call that "severe veginitus" in psychology 
 Rucka's got it rough he got his bullshit taken off 
 All you meshuganas at youtube got a chopstick in your butt 
 What the hell's your fuckin' problem 
 You just jockin' rucka's cock 
 'Cause he got weezy f baby on this song (for free) 
 You all dunno me weezy's my homie 
 'So you all can blow me 
 'Cause I don't care if you take my song down 
 You think I'm from china 
 But check my vagina 'cause I lied I'm really from 
 Japan 
 Yeah 
 What's up 
 I don't care if you suspend my account 
 Fuck 
 You 
 I'm above the law! Right weezy? (Huh huh yeah huh huh huh) 
 I don't care if you delete my video 
 I have so many people that will reload it in varius places where you cannot control 
 I have an army of small children workin in the sweatshop every single day 
 Buy my song on itune and amazon dot com thank you come again
