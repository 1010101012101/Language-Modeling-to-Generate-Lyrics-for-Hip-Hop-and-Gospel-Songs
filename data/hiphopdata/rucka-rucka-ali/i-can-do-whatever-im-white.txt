Wait a minute, 
 Ha ha! 
 I'm white! 
 Ha ha ha 
 I can do whatever, I'm white 
 Yeah, I can do whatever I'm white 
 Yeah 
 When I'm in Detroit, 
 I run red lights 
 The cops don't mind 
 Inside, They say, "You can do whatever, you white" (I'm white) 
 Baby, I Can do whatever I'm white 
 Yeah 
 I got-a me some clothes, 
 I dress real whack 
 Bright white pants, 
 And a fanny pack, 
 I can dress however I like 
 Baby, I can do whatever, I'm white (I'm white) 
 Yeah 
 Anything I want 
 I could buy a couple stocks 
 And I sit outside, 
 And I drink some red wine 
 And the cops drive by, 
 And they shout "Hell yeah!", 
 'Cause you know that the cops don't care, yeah 
 I love me some hockey 
 I need me some hockey 
 Frisbees all right, but it ain't no hockey 
 Buy me a retriever, 
 And listen to Reba 
 And I could be a stay-at-home dad 
 Yeah 
 When I'm in Detroit, 
 I run red lights 
 The cops don't mind, 
 Inside they say "You can do whatever, you white" (I'm white) 
 Baby, I can do whatever I'm white 
 Yeah 
 I got-a me some clothes 
 I dress real whack 
 Bright white pants and a fanny pack 
 I can dress however I like 
 Baby, I can do whatever, I'm white (I'm white) 
 Yeah 
 Any time I want, man 
 I could go golfin' 
 I could go joggin' 
 Ride on my moped 
 Right out to the lakefront 
 In my Dodge-Neon 
 Do me some fishin', and some jet-skiin' 
 Grab me my keys, 
 And head out to the skate rink 
 Got my rollerblades, 
 And my camcorder taping 
 I could wear my shorts up above my knees, 
 And I always pay my Blockbuster fees 
 Yeah 
 I love me some hockey 
 I need me some hockey 
 Frisbees all right, but it ain't no hockey 
 Buy me a retriever, 
 And listen to Reba 
 And I could be a stay-at-home dad 
 Yeah 
 When I'm in Detroit, 
 I run red lights 
 The cops don't mind 
 Inside, They say, "You can do whatever, you white" (I'm white) 
 Baby, I Can do whatever I'm white 
 Yeah 
 I got-a me some clothes, 
 I dress real whack 
 Bright white pants, 
 And a fanny pack, 
 I can dress however I like 
 Baby, I can do whatever, I'm white (I'm white) 
 Yeah
