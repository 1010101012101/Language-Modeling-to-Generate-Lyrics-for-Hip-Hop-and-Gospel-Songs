Ayo, This Rucka Rucka Ali 
 This song goes out to everybody that went out and saw the movie "Notorious" 
 I'd like to hear from y'all 
 So you can tell me what it's about 
 'Cause I didn't see it 
 Here we go 
 Seems like yesterday, you was droppin' tracks 
 Diddy 
 was Puff Daddy, and he had some stacks 
 That was back when e-mail was called a fax 
 You got clapped in the back just like Tupac, I mean 
 2Pac 
 Sorry, I'm ignant 
 You'll notice my Caucasian pigment 
 But I didn't meant to get off the subject 
 Tryn'a trace it back to where it all begun 
 You was about 21 
 Runnin' around with guns 
 But you couldn't run fast 'cause you weighed a ton 
 And your son's gettin' blasted 
 Didn't look fun 
 Ten years later, your movie's done 
 Now everyone knows all about your life 
 Everybody likin' it except for your wife 
 Lil' Kim 
 wasn't happy about this movie 
 And neither was I, till I saw Kim's boobies 
 To my man 
 Biggie 
 I'll see your movie 
 When it's on blu-ray 
 Or on DVD 
 I'll be watching you 
 Waiting for the day 
 When it's on TV 
 I could watch it 
 Then I ain't tryn'a pay to be watching you 
 I did see the trailer though, and I got some questions 
 Ayo, 
 Who the hell was the guy that they got playin' 
 Puffy 
 ? 
 He looks nothing like him 
 Who killed my bud, wazzup? 
 What did he do to make you do it? 
 Was he too busy makin' the band 
 Twenty2 
 ? 
 You could have made it out to the movie shoot 
 And save it for lookin' really stupid 
 You out gettin' salary 
 The guy playin' you looks like Phil Bellamy 
 At least 
 Will Smith 
 wasn't in this movie 
 He would have been runnin' around and defusin' bombs like the aliens and robots 
 In the Wild, Wild West, and the days of the Gold Rush 
 Tell me what the hell's goin' on? 
 The movie made it look like Biggie had three songs 
 And 'Lil Kim looked like a bling 
 And Biggie's mom looked like she could speak English 
 To my man 
 Biggie 
 I'll see your movie 
 When it's on blu-ray 
 Or on DVD 
 I'll be watching you 
 Waiting for the day 
 When it's on TV 
 I could watch it 
 Then I ain't tryn'a pay to be watching you 
 One thing, for sure 
 When the movie's over 
 I'm askin' for my money back 
 To my man 
 Biggie 
 I'll see your movie 
 When it's on blu-ray 
 Or on DVD 
 When it's on TV 
 I could see it then it 
 Then I ain't tryn'a pay to be watching you 
 Or maybe on blu-ray or DVD
