I walk up to the police in detroit city 
 I'm like 
 Excuse me officer I'm tryin' find some weed 
 He's like 
 Shit so are we why don't you roll with me ? 
 "We gonna go round pulling over some minorities" 
 What I'm talking bout 
 Camp in the police ride, ride 
 Crackin' 40 size, size 
 Nigga we be gankin high, high 
 Me and the cops drive drive round go'n 60 
 When we see a trick ass bitch 
 We gonna tell that hoe to drop them tittieees 
 Go cops get the dogs 
 Lets go fuck with old folks 
 That's right let's get high and pull over black guys 
 Go cops smoke some drugs 
 Bitch ass rolling with the fuzz 
 And no 
 Pow pow pow pow 
 Pow pow pow pow 
 (Refrain ends) 
 So we drive over our car up to KFC 
 And were like gimme 
 A chicken sandwich and waffle fries for free 
 But everyone ran out the store and were like 
 "Hey come back here, were just hungry we won't search 
 For no crack rocks Neggar
