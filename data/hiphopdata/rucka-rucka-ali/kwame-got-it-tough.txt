 Kwame been so sweet now we got him in the slammer 
 Why we got him in the camper? 
 I'm tryna get the charge on Kwame dropped 
 I'm tryna let my brother Kwame out 
 I'm Tryna get the charge on Kwame dropped 
 I'm tryna let my brother Kwame out 
 Kwame got it rough 
 I think he done enough 
 Kwame got it tough 
 Kwame got it rough 
 Why we lock him up? 
 Kwame got it rough 
 I think he done enough 
 Kwame got it tough 
 Kwame got it rough 
 Why we lock him up? 
 Kwame send some text to his lady like wow 
 Kwame took a trip out to Winser like wow 
 The city been legit with Kilpatrick in charge 
 The city gonna miss when Kilpatrick in charge 
 Kwame can't run for another eight years 
 Kwame gonna get re-elected for sure 
 Kwame's prison gaurds best treat him real good 
 Kwame gonna get back the city eight years 
 'Cause we'd like to see the charge on Kwame dropped 
 'Cause we wanna get the charge on Kwame dropped 
 West B woulda got the charge on Kwame dropped 
 Can we just agree to let the city drop it? 
 Kwame got it rough 
 I think he done enough 
 Kwame got it tough 
 Kwame got it rough 
 Why we lock him up? 
 Kwame got it rough 
 I think he done enough 
 Kwame got it tough 
 Kwame got it rough 
 Why we lock him up? 
 Kwame said the prison that he in ain't fit 
 Kwame says he sorry 'cause he lied about it 
 Why he gotta sit in prison thinkin' about it? 
 Can't he get a ticket and a slap on the wrist? 
 Got some text-he sent some back 
 Why we gonna let the city get off track? 
 Kwame lied a bit-what's wrong with that? 
 Bring his ass back to the city right back, Kwame. 
 Kwame got it rough 
 I think he done enough 
 Kwame got it tough 
 Kwame got it rough 
 Why we lock him up? 
 I'm tryna get the charge on Kwame dropped 
 I'm tryna let my brother Kwame out 
 I'm Tryna get the charge on Kwame dropped 
 I'm tryna let my brother Kwame out 
 Kwame got it rough 
 I think he done enough 
 Kwame got it tough 
 Kwame got it rough 
 Why we lock him up? 
 In West B, Mayor wouldn't be committed for it 
 In West B, Mayor woulda been a quitter for it 
 Kwame I got a little chedder for ya 
 Kwame I got like seven fifty for ya 
 Kwame why they take away the city from ya? 
 Kwame I got a new city for ya 
 West B be a better city for ya 
 West B we give the key to the city to ya 
 Kwame got it rough
