 I'm a Korean 
 Oh, Herro! Remember me? 
 My name is DJ Not Nice (I'm A Korean) 
 You might remember me from my last record, 
 Ching Chang Chong 
 (I'm a Korean) 
 You made me very rich (I'm a Korean) 
 And now I roll in American money 
 I'm a Korean 
 And I'd like my Chinee food cooked right 
 'Cause they're not giving me the good rice 
 And the dyke giving me my food, 
 Looks like a lesbian 
 I don't like how my beef pork looks like 
 And the last time I eat your food, I 
 Got the rice chicken beef tofu 
 Now I poop while I'm peeing 
 Yeehee 
 And you might not believe I could fight 
 I'm a white belt, 
 But I have two stripes 
 I don't like all you little blue-eyed dumb white Europeans 
 I would like to just drink my Bud Light 
 Maybe bomb a couple things in Hawaii 
 And blow up the countries I don't like 
 'Cause I'm a Korean 
 I'm not that nice (uh uh) 
 I build a bomb (yeah) 
 Then pick a country (you) 
 And blow it up 
 I work for NASA (cool) 
 We look at stars (wow) 
 You know Apollo? 
 That movie is good 
 I talk like Ching Chang Chong 
 Why do you drop on me so much napalm 
 I been trained to kill, 
 With my Tai Kwan Do 
 And my whole continent 
 Is a dry-cleaning store 
 Bonzai! 
 I like to play 
 Magic cards 
 You heard of China? 
 I was in charge, 
 Of China Town 
 In Vietnam, 
 I'm still around 
 You can come through to play 
 When I play poker, 
 I just throw all my chips in 
 Herro, I'm yerro, just like Homer Simpson 
 I smoke coke its fun 
 You think I'm joking, mon? 
 I made alot of money from pokemon 
 I'm a Korean 
 Yeehee 
 I think Michael Jackson's a good guy 
 I don't mind if he sleeps with young guys 
 'Cause in my country, 
 We can touch young guys on their penis 
 And my wife is thirteen, 
 And cooks my, macaroni and cheese so good I, 
 Got her out on the street for a good good price 
 Ten years ago 
 I'm not gonna lie (uh uh) 
 I like it rough (Huh huh) 
 Hilary Clinton 
 Let's get it on (woo) 
 I have a missile (Huh uh) 
 It's very small (So small) 
 It's in my pants (hehe) 
 I can't get it up (Awww) 
 I bomb New York (oops) 
 Better luck (next time) 
 You heard of London? (Uh huh) 
 Not anymore (Awww) 
 I bomb Iran (Yeah) 
 Oops, that's Japan (Not again) 
 I made a goof 
 Now I gotta start again 
 I roll the world up in a ball like Katamari 
 If I bomb your crib, yep, sorry 
 I'm a ninja warrior 
 I went to Harvard 
 I bomb Pearl Harbor 
 I want the whole world to know that I'm powerful 
 *In Korean* "I am small penis!" 
 Everyone to the floor 
 We all gonna die, die, die, die 
 Put your head between your legs and say Koni Chi Wa wa wa wa 
 Death to all 
 Fuck the world 
 'Cause I like Tupac pac pac pac 
 No the world must stop stop stop stop 
 'Cause of my small cock cock cock cock 
 One day, you'll say 
 "Why is everyone dead?" 
 Why didn't we just do what Kim Jung Il said? 
 Now we are all slaves 
 Monkeys run this place 
 It's Planet of the Apes 
 Oh, okay 
 I'm a Korean 
 Yeehee 
 And I'm not gonna beef with Suge Knight 
 Because I think that if he heard my, 
 My Tupac parody, he'd find me and tell me I'm stealing 
 Hurry up, take a picture of me dangling this baby over the balcony 
 And I'd like my Chinee food cooked right 
 I don't like Japanese or the Thai 
 I would like to see the whole world die 'cause I'm a Korean 
 Yeeheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...
