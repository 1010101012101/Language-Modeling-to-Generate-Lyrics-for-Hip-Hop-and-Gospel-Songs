 > From 'Tear Da Club Up' (repeat 2X) 
 Where da dollas at 
 Nigga where da dollas at 
 "I'm chillin' heavy understand me baby this Gangsta Boo" 
 Where da dollas at 
 Nigga where da dollas at 
 (Gangsta Boo) 
 Now let me kick a little somethin' 
 About this lady named Boo 
 Haven't you heard of the things Miss Boo is capable to do 
 Get your mind twisted like some dress 
 Under Jamaicans head 
 Vicky lingere 
 Candles (??) on the bed 
 Blazing hella weed 
 Concentrating on what's next, be next 
 Bet you by the dolar 
 Make you holler, where them Benji's at 
 Comin' out your pocket 
 Don't be stoppin' 
 What can happen baby 
 How many niggas get the chance to be in the mist up lady (never) 
 Not be goin' 
 Cause my game is just to big for that 
 Gangsta Boo be watchin' 
 All the Prophet niggas got my back 
 What you see in me 
 Nigga roll is what I meant to be 
 Sippin' on Henn and Grinn 
 And then your face 
 Tryin' to get your cheese 
 Why you be's 
 Sayin' I'm drownin' you out 
 But still pagin' me 
 Never answer the phone 
 Cause you name be on my caller ID 
 I guess you can say I'm kinda crazy in my own ways 
 Fuck bein' broke on days 
 Ladies gots to get paid 
 Get me amazed at how these bitches 
 Havin' babies by niggas 
 With no pot to piss in 
 Or no mone to give her 
 What the fuck 
 Why you hoes want to live that way 
 I be sceemin' for some chedder 
 Every god damn day 
 Not to be the fuckin' one 
 Lookin' sad and broke 
 No nigga to fuck with 
 No weed to smoke 
 Hard times got me whinin' 
 Conversation and kickin' it 
 Hooked up with a little Chris 
 Now I'm back on my pimpin' 
 Thinkin' up a fuckin' plan 
 How to get you man 
 Damn I hope you understand 
 Money came with the scam 
 We be chillin' in the cities 
 Of New York and L.A. 
 It is all good 
 Get my conflict on 
 Smokin' on hay 
 I had to stay 
 But anyway I feel you hatin' on me 
 You look into my eyes 
 And stop but still you hatin' on me (nevermind) 
 Fuck it, I ain't takin' it personal 
 I'm about my business 
 Well I have to kick it sooner or later 
 So I ain't trippin' 
 (DJ Paul) 
 I keeps my shit in control 
 Straight dumpin' diamonds and gold 
 Playas all up in my soul 
 While pots arranged in a row 
 Up in the be -I-?-? 
 These hoes been waitin' to see me 
 I hope that bitch got my cheese 
 Can't leave with less than the keyes 
 I'm scopin' out some more talent 
 Needs some new hoes for my palace 
 The more hoes that I just grab 
 They hated on my like melon 
 Soon as I hit the front door 
 They scope the go around my coller 
 I'm have to come upon loot 
 I can't even spare a dollar 
 I got to roll gang style, bitch 
 (Juicy "J") 
 I got a rolex on my wrist trick 
 Can't you hoes get some of this 
 Some niggas want to take my place 
 Some hoes be beggin' ride my dick 
 I be stopped 
 The Juice gon' shine 
 The droopies pokin' in my rhyme 
 I'm living good and feelin' fine 
 I'm high off weed, then liqour and wine 
 Just roll it up, I fold it up 
 These bottle pop, pour it in my cup 
 The niggas who work from 9 to 5 
 Are on the corner, post it up 
 We still can ball, the Juice and Paul 
 The deals we make, the shots we call 
 Auntropronuers on world wide tour 
 The only thing we save is cheese not brawl 
 Aw yeah Hypnotized Minds up in here 
 You know the business 
 Gangsta Boo solo tape, y'all know the scope 
 Featuring the Tear Da Club Up Thugs, wsup, all hot 
 It's on, where the dollers at 
 Where I'm at, on the map
