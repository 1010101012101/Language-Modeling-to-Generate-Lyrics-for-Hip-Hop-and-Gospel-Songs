I got mask on face, hand on heat 
 'Bout to rob my connect 
 'Cause I know he got them keys 
 I ain't no crosser but a nigga gotta eat 
 I ain't, I ain't no crosser 
 (I ain't no) 
 But a nigga gotta eat 
 (Gotta eat) 
 I got mask on face, hand on heat 
 'Bout to rob my connect 
 'Cause I know he got them keys 
 I ain't no crosser but a nigga gotta eat 
 I ain't, I ain't no crosser 
 (I ain't no) 
 But a nigga gotta eat 
 (Gotta eat) 
 I be gettin' work from the same dude five sum'n years 
 Laid back 'bout the years, it's what you do with them years 
 Went through the cheers and tears, my life took a change 
 As soon as I bought a thing I blew the whole thing 
 Me, LL and Chris at my crib gettin' pissed 
 Drunk, drainin', coke to the brain 
 And hit the strip club, find a girl that's game 
 And back to the pad, put the X in her vein 
 And we can talk about that a whole 'nuther day 
 But today a nigga pockets ain't straight 
 Long story short, I done fucked my money off 
 Straight to the point, I gotta holla at my boss 
 (At my boss) 
 I got mask on face, hand on heat 
 'Bout to rob my connect 
 'Cause I know he got them keys 
 I ain't no crosser but a nigga gotta eat 
 I ain't, I ain't no crosser 
 (I ain't no) 
 But a nigga gotta eat 
 (Gotta eat) 
 I got mask on face, hand on heat 
 'Bout to rob my connect 
 'Cause I know he got them keys 
 I ain't no crosser but a nigga gotta eat 
 I ain't, I ain't no crosser 
 (I ain't no) 
 But a nigga gotta eat 
 (Gotta eat) 
 I really don't want to be robbin' this nigga 
 Remember in terms that we're hot with the siegle 
 But now I gotta soft this nigga 
 Drop this nigga, pop this nigga 
 We cockin' to make a lil' nigga run outta town 
 To pick up powder, pills and pounds of kush 
 Not realisin', the shit gon' get took 
 Remember, would this nigga play by the book? 
 Now [unverified] got that nigga shook 
 Snitched on me but is this good? 
 Sin took no second look 
 Nigga didn't make my money 
 Put no money on my books 
 Now I gotta get up for the stash 
 Dash and pop his hood 
 Why can't a nigga just keep the shit trill 
 And not be goin' out like a hoe? 
 Then he not become the bro of me, I am the scarecrow 
 No, I can't just run off with his doe 
 And let him go after that 
 His niggas know my niggas 
 Got the automatics wit' that 
 I got mask on face, hand on heat 
 'Bout to rob my connect 
 'Cause I know he got them keys 
 I ain't no crosser but a nigga gotta eat 
 I ain't, I ain't no crosser 
 (I ain't no) 
 But a nigga gotta eat 
 (Gotta eat) 
 I got mask on face, hand on heat 
 'Bout to rob my connect 
 'Cause I know he got them keys 
 I ain't no crosser but a nigga gotta eat 
 I ain't, I ain't no crosser 
 (I ain't no) 
 But a nigga gotta eat 
 (Gotta eat)
