 {Koopsta Knicca} 
 It's a murder man serve hurt a man 
 Do him in quick drop his corpse in a can 
 Broken hand Satanic techniques creep 
 Sweep him off his feet commence to boxing that bitch 
 So say you want to rumble with the rough Koopsta 
 Slugs bust sluts for the Mafia (Mafia Mafia ya) 
 Duck from my clutch fore your blood kicks quick 
 Pimp shit never miss if me shoot that bitch 
 Mentally insane there's no hoe up in my brain 
 You may say that I'm deranged when I blow out your brains 
 Mane I ain't playing don't test this bitch 
 Shit I walk between the spaces of the morning and the darkeness 
 Ripped up chopped down the yellow sick road 
 Cause a hoe choked bust nose kill a hoe 
 So hear the little drummer beat 
 Switch here to lose it 
 Preachers in the noose Satanic cartoons fool
