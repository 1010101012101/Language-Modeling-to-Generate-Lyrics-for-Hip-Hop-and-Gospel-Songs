(Tonedeff) 
 Yo, first I sprinkle a verse 
 By adding words, rhymes 
 Flippin 'em in to a verse with lines 
 Then ima hit 'em with spurts rhyme 
 Then ima let 'em and split 'em and add 
 Feelin' my wrath 
 Vagrantly depart to the south so dirty 
 You want to be given a bath 
 Give it a pathelogical lie to deny that I'm nice 
 And the truth hurts (ow) 
 Wearin' a blue shirt the best buy for the price 
 Figure, Six guys this live and nice on the mic 
 So don't dis us because we're fly, 
 Until you try what it's like 
 I'm liable to Slice at these emcee bastards 
 Leaving their knees fractured 
 Needing every piece of their teeth re-crafted 
 So don't front 'cause I see past it 
 You're harmless like wolverines adamantium claws 
 Yhen they're retracted 
 The scene's backlit, 
 It seems static will wreack havoc 
 A beat battered, I'll keep rappin' 
 In leech battle, will dreams shatter 
 In three nanoseconds (damn) 
 Count your patients, One step to Tonedeff 
 You're gone in sixty seconds like (?) 
 (Deacon) 
 I leave you riddled with basics 
 There's no need for complexity 
 To be beside myself I need God next to me 
 Just kiddin' 
 I'm patially bull shittin' 
 The only time I take a loss pussy's 
 When I lose kittens 
 I pitch shit past 'ya, no matter who's hittin 
 I don't capsize boats, 
 But I got crews flippin' 
 You catch it? the message needs analisation 
 Step and your boys will be pouring alcoholic libations 
 I flew sick, you knew this 
 I'll puzzle you, doofus 
 Fuck mental 
 In the stretcher went to a physical (?) 
 It will take more than stick to rearrange it then change it 
 His language is so strange, how do we contain it? 
 You can't just paint this stuff up on a canvas 
 You have to get the mental picture 
 To begin to understand this 
 So, Anticipate defeat, the league chances 
 Got your head speared, no lances 
 Doing burial dances 
 (Sankofa) 
 I'm giving forty like with speech imediments 
 Each other threat causes confident cats to stutter, 
 Step caught a reputation down the sides: 
 Too raw for porn, over thugs plates of leftovers 
 Eat some warm dober 
 Thug's a jaded wordsmith, 
 Bleeding ghost writer's pen's dry 
 Get on other rapper's nerves 
 Corroding dead, dryed sweat 
 My thoughts connect, 
 You ought to step away fast, 
 It seems I gave cats "hey that's the way they make tracks" 
 Forget a scare, I'm not generous, kid 
 Split society of (?) and indented in (?) 
 Independently sick 
 And this is just a quick reminder 
 If you was to pick a cipher 
 Then I'll bust you quick to write yours 
 All expenses paid, no questions asked 
 I'll get open in the cut and we can flesh your gash 
 Cat, relax. Man, the last time I took a breather 
 I got brought up on murder charges 
 Start the crooked finger 
 (Know) 
 Yo, I'm not the fella to rifF with 
 I'm so nice Mr. Rogers sued my ass 
 For copyright infringement 
 Roll with henchemen, 
 Not, we'll switch heads 
 From wanna be thugs to 24/7 bitch kids 
 I'll bring my shitlist 
 Production cat bastards want jiggy beats 
 For some whack rappers 
 Switch my style if you're tryin' to play, 
 My beats will maraud your ass any time of day 
 Like deuce Biggalow's chick, 
 Whenever your through shit 
 People see you and holler "That's one huge bitch!" 
 Shit, when the LP rolls out 
 The source will be forced to make the quotables 
 A three page fold-out 
 No doubt, I'm fed up with this whack shit 
 Ballin the next gear, wearing abercrombie and fitch 
 Any Jiggy rapper acting fly on the radio 
 Is getting pulled out of rotation like a firestone radial 
 (Kashal Tee) 
 Catch the Tee, the hip hop scene I fathom 
 Let people know my windows belt keeps my jeans from sagging 
 It seems I'm raggin, 
 But feinds been naggin' for my next release 
 I apply all my expertise to make them extra pleased 
 Even get the breaks to peace that make a brother feel this 
 All I do is independent, like double helix 
 Selling out? well I hope that you're not 
 But how else could you afford all the soap that you drop? 
 You can't fuck wit me, yo, kid look 
 Taking me out ain't no small feat, you ain't bigfoot 
 You should know who the heck you're facing 
 'Cause my reputation leaves no room for speculation 
 Now battle, is that you want to do? 
 What kind of man are you? 
 I bet you sit on (?) 
 Now that it's proven to you 
 You got a lot to tell us, 
 Them got your heart skipping beats like accapellas 
 (Celph-titled) 
 I'll be a mythic author, 
 Writing poems on tombstones 
 Celph-titled and, nigga you couldn't bring home 
 I'm at the crib wit your bitch givin' me slow head 
 Split you up in more pieces than when Jesus broke bread 
 My click is raw, be prepared when you meet us 
 Kill an unborn baby and you still couldn't de-fetus (ooh) 
 I don't battle with rhymes, 
 I'd rather battle with nines 
 Instead of using my mind 
 I'd rather shatter your spine 
 The closest you ever came to a punch line, 
 Was waiting for refreshments at the prom in '89 
 I'm super crafty, super nasty, super rhaspy 
 Fuckin' bitches with super asscheeks 
 You fucking faggots don't know the wrong speeches 
 I beat a bitch until her whole body turns to cleavage 
 I'm hyperactive so I drink decaffinated 
 My left jab is fatal, leave your cats decapitated!
