(Feat. Extended Famm) 
 Can you feel the speed comin' 
 The beat's hummin 
 You need somethin' to keep ya knees bucklin 
 Keep frontin 
 You'll be thuggin' from these huntin on bees 
 Scummin airin out these fuckin' emcees 
 Puffin till breeze 
 Somethin' to each one of my words 
 Is just suddenly stern and it's fun and you learn 
 Through action not example 
 That's exactly why I have to smack you 
 Learn that *smacks* learn it again *smacks* got it now? 
 Didn't ya know that Tonedeff could flow fast enough to mow Sonic down 
 Well I'm on it's shot on ya senses 
 Hoppin the fences could it be the one to get offended 
 Or else is deaf or the nigga that pretended 
 To the senses when I run, niggaz sense this 
 Hell a brother better be servin' avenges 
 It's me either with this set of bentleys 
 Then in down in left kill left with a horse here 
 Probably gonna need a veterinary in a relentess 
 Better get a move one 
 You harlot you bonness you falls with blue balls 
 You all really think it end little could just shove in a bill 
 With you all and pretube all 
 Naw like 'cause I done never heard of batman 
 Scared of thinkin' last stan 
 Walkin' in arabs to back dams 
 Thinkin' ya niggaz could get it quicker than a maniac 
 'Cause bigger than a one chillin' miss him like his flash can 
 Can't stand these motherfuckers that can't rap 
 Tonedeff could scan this shit while on a sand mass 
 Fuck a chick and tell her pussycat now 
 Y'all niggaz are pretty confused cause you be chillin' with a bat hat 
 Practice while Stash kick your ass bitch 
 Ya too average to consider some hash and the task 
 Cause TV is real and the speed is just feedin me 
 You fuckers acknowledge the speedy 
 Do you feel the need for speed 
 Indeed ya do we need ya to 
 Clear the way to speed ya through 
 Can you feel the velocity just hold tight 
 Bare witness to what future emcees will flow like 
 You wacker than Ja Rule we fast and furious like Vin Diesel 
 Ain't penetrates the papyrus my p-izz-eople 
 Sookie sookie you rookie goodie goodie we been evil 
 Fuck 101 told them I'll take ten people 
 Now even up the odds cause you with your friend's people 
 Style's been played like movies with ten sequels 
 (Do you love hip hop?) 
 Does Eminem offend people? 
 So do we so absolutely nothin's what you showin me 
 Totally magnificent what you want is insignificant 
 In the big picture bitch nigga you so sensitive 
 Gonna squirt some I hurt one or two persons 
 For the first done you mommy's suckin the girth numb 
 Beat it up and make her cum 
 E F@mm makin' you nerves run 
 Wanna get the mic this curtains 
 If you done like 'em and ya ear's done 
 Blow me, hold me, hold that 
 Mouthful of cock sauce and a ballsack 
 You be eatin till I go wack 
 That's never homie, know that 
 Say what you want but don't ever claim that you want it 
 Stay in the closet and you'll sustain so much pain that you'll vomit 
 Silent objects you never swallow like hollow organs 
 You cough up dried esophagus knot to notches we're the marvelous too 
 Then I'm part of the crew that came to astonish 
 The plague is brolic, scrape ya face with abrasive cleanser 
 Say that we're reigning comet things a promise 
 You love her for real I just set up the kill 
 And Substantial latches in that can which set ya head on the hill 
 That's plenty for the world to see 
 Everybody wanna get bazigga to the run to get the tour with me 
 Score with these, they're for ya team ensure your dream 
 And fuckin' up the wizzer with a ball disease 
 The problem's he's aborn of three 
 But all I see do you breathe nothing but a corpse, see? 
 You be lookin' for a ride and the reason you dying 
 In the blink of an eye then they all with me 
 Hold ya screams in pickin' up the flow from the court the king's in 
 From Newport to Kingston and give you more defeats 
 And wars than Norman eats complete with more dead soldiers meat 
 And keep the order straight 
 Sweepin me is more 'n' vague than even orchestry 
 They raise more pieces of you than your whore's abortion tapes (Oh that's great) 
 Substantial why you rap so slow? 
 I got asthma, give me a second *puff* let's see ya fuckin' rap faster 
 I'm stronger, harder, spit quicker, stronger 
 Even my dick's bigger, longer 
 In fact it sucks to be you, hoe what can we do? 
 You're a weaker seeder postal boy 
 Pussy eatin needs a hug 
 Cause your pussy you stained cock 
 I reek of stained twat, my speech is slain hot 
 We weak? I think not, we lick in pink spots 
 We drink the slain cops who were crooked 
 The little crops that got a fuckin' ticket 
 Who spat on my dollars 
 Then shout at these cowards last jaws 
 By rippin the rap tours 
 With a little or no audience 
 Killed an acapella even flipped into accordions 
 Not a battle rapper backpacker bitch smacker thug 
 Just someone you can whoop yo ass 
 Over rap and show you love 
 So any further sleeping beneath is not recommended 
 Will never be fame if you haven't already been refunded
