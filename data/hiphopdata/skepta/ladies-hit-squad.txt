Girl I pull up to your city with them racks out (racks out) 
 You know how I do it, shows be packed out (packed out) 
 All them girls they pretty they gone twerk for me (for me) 
 Nasty baby please put out that work for me (work for me) 
 Now I knows a couple niggas got my swag swag (swag swag) 
 They stole my swag swag (swag swag) 
 They can have that swag swag (swag swag) 
 Because Flacko Jodye dun told me let them have that 
 I don't want it that back (that back) 
 I don't want it that back (that back) 
 Bu da Bap Bap 
 With me, me 
 She wants to be with me, me 
 Everyday she's thinking about me, me 
 She never met nobody like me, me 
 It's ooh 
 I wanna know what's on the agenda 
 Keep it real don't be a pretender 
 This is my show I'm the presenter 
 Time is money I'm a big spender 
 We can have a mad one we can have a bender 
 Order what you want from the bartender 
 Come back to mine and that would be splendour 
 I'll give you a night to remember 
 Let's get the bed rocking 
 Undo the stocking from the suspender (ooh, ooh) 
 The legs are so soft and tender 
 Tonight you can be my contender (Dirty.) 
 I wanna mix and I want to blender 
 To another world I wanna send her 
 Over the bars I'm wanna bend her 
 Give her the cockney like an Eastender

 I'm gonna hit the G spot when I get the jeans off 
 Press on the gas and then I ease off 
 Kiss on your neck there you go he's off 
 Back so big look like your jeans shrunk in the wash 
 And we don't really need Netflix I'm a give you something to watch 
 After we're done bill a spliff and coutch 
 Pour me a glass of the Henny on the rocks 
 Get ready for round two 'cause you know anytime we knock boot then you know we knock 
 Twice 
 So lucky I found you girl 
 You were looking way too cold in your Reebok Ice 
 Tell your girlfriend you don't need advice Always in your ear like he's not nice 
 She's just upset that she got juiced in the bunk bed 
 And you know she's not wife 
 See me with the street goons in the ends 
 Next day I'm in the GQ top 10 
 Track suit mafia the best dressed men 
 Linked us now she don't wanna link them man again 
 Your ex plays is in the prem but you never see him tacking a pen 
 'Cause if you can't hit the G spot when it comes to the spot kicks 
 Man have to wait on the bench
