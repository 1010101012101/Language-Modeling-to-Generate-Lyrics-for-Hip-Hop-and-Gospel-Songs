Yeah, don't know, Giggs, Skeps 
 Browse it, Boom Productions 
 SN1, Boy better know 
 Look out, you bastards 
 SN1 on my T again 
 My black trousers D and G again 
 Looking like a G again 
 That's right it's me again 
 My big four 5's gotta flea in 'em 
 Think I've only got one Mac, got three of 'em 
 Then you won't see me again 
 Time to get the white in and the B again 
 Just got some high grades from Vesra 
 I'm a real G so I gotta little extra 
 I like hot girls 'cause I'm extra 
 Thought about my lighty then I text her 
 Impressed her, thinks I'm on shit 
 'Cause I'm doing it with Skepta 
 Take off your whole head top, Hannibal Lector 
 Black director, shoot up shit then I cut in the Vectra 
 Orange bud weed, lookin' nectar 
 Strap a big boy spliff sotum nester 
 Had to breeze onto Chester 
 Gotta new flav link, gotta tester 
 Potent white girl so I pressed her 
 Hugh Hefner pitch niggers like Scarface did Hector 
 Breeze in there like car chase with feds car 
 It's looking like them chase, wanna get her 
 I'm the best 'cause I ain't in the white game 
 Were the best, bruv, we got the best love 
 So come against us 
 This is the hard shit, makes you wanna lick out a cartridge 
 Look out, you bastards, we push out the hard shit 
 This is the hard shit, makes you wanna lick out a cartridge 
 Look out, you bastards, we push out the hard shit 
 Now this might sound a bit cheeky 
 But I don't even try fam, I make it look easy, naturally greazy 
 Me and Giggs run up and take all the gold coins like Mario and Luigi 
 You wanna say somethin' say it when you see me 
 Don't phone me, save your credit 
 'Cause if you can't tell me what happens after you die 
 I don't wanna hear it 
 You ain't half a gangster, nowhere near it 
 Meridian, that's my murdering force 
 Giggs beat the sken in south, I heard it in north 
 They hate [Incomprehensible] better know t-shirts 
 And SN1 wear for the whole world to endorse course 
 North's up in this bitch 
 I don't know what you heard but you can't take the piss 
 If you saw what the kick back done to my wrist 
 You would have never put my name on your murder list 
 Fam, if you interrupt the vibe that I'm in then 
 I ride, ride, ride with my tings so fuck them niggers 
 Everyday I'm surrounded by killers like I was on a lifers wing 
 See, I'm a cool brotha with a heart of the wickedest 
 Violate me I squeeze this till it finishes 
 Then I switch cliques like Holloman switches chicks 
 Rinse the machine like bombiy 
 I call that Buju Banton light up your head like a lantern 
 Boy Better Know standard, look out that's the anthem 
 Ask all the man them, out here in the crime scene I'm a champion 
 Until I get a mansion I'm a keep murdering spitters at random 
 This is the hard shit, makes you wanna lick out a cartridge 
 Look out, you bastards, we push out the hard shit 
 This is the hard shit, makes you wanna lick out a cartridge 
 Look out, you bastards, we push out the hard shit 
 What they gonna say now? How can you have a hit yet? 
 2 B-E-T nominees on one track we can write at home 
 But we wanna write in the studio and make it look good 
 SN1, Boy Better Know, done know
