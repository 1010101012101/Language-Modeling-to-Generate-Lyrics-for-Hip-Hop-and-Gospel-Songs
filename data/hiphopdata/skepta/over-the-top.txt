I want a hundred percent not 50/50 
 I get money but my name ain't fifty 
 Went to the Lloyd bank took out a young buck 
 Brown, purple, pinkie 
 Then I put pink stones in a binkie 
 Then I put all six in a motor black jacket to minimize any injuries 
 Come follow me 
 A lot of money is exchanging hands 
 They wanna know boy betta know plans 
 I told them smell this 
 Can you smell that 
 Plans 
 These other guys ain't got no fans 
 Wait till Jay and me see these lands 
 Come follow me 
 I wanna make more than a hundred 
 I wanna make more than a thousand 
 I wanna make more than a mill 
 So I keep counting bills 
 1, 2, 3, 4 
 410 from the top more 
 1, 2, 3, 4 
 410 from the top more 
 I was frivolous but I'm a saver 
 I'm a hustler by nature 
 I can sell bread to a baker 
 Sell a fence to my next door neighbor 
 I wanna buy a rack with a laser 
 'Cause I'm famous but I'm still a raver 
 See me in the club say 
 He ain't got a bottle of champagne 
 He's got two 
 I'm like babe babe that's how we do 
 Your man can't do it like me 
 No I ain't leave with the beef 
 Come follow me 
 I wanna make more than a hundred 
 I wanna make more than a thousand 
 I wanna make more than a mill 
 So I keep counting bills 
 1, 2, 3, 4 
 410 from the top more 
 1, 2, 3, 4 
 410 from the top more 
 I make money but I don't work in the mint 
 Brown, purple, pink 
 The queen looks pretty in pink 
 These other MCs are skin 
 I'm looking at a black like my limosine tint 
 I don't want nobody to see me 
 Unless I'm on TV 
 Come follow me 
 Jack and stack I've done that 
 See the ground I run that 
 1000 miles max and Jay 
 Burn that 
 More money more paper 
 I wanna get some mortgages 
 These other men don't know what ballin is 
 Come follow me 
 I wanna make more than a hundred 
 I wanna make more than a thousand 
 I wanna make more than a mill 
 So I keep counting bills 
 1, 2, 3, 4 
 410 from the top more 
 1, 2, 3, 4 
 410 from the top more 
 Yeah 
 More money more paper 
 I'm not saying I'm a fader 
 But I get

 Get money
