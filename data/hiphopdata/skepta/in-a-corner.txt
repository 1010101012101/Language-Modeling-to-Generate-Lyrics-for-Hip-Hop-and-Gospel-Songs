A likkle darker 
 Microphone check, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 
 Keep dancing till the party's done 
 I ain't come here to hurt anyone 
 I don't wanna hear no talk about gun 
 The only thing I wanna pop is champagne 
 Until my face is feelin' numb 
 See two mandem, wagwan dun 
 Check out the buff ting with a big bum 
 Me and the madem we look dapped 
 Black, hood, jeans and caps 
 I ain't come hear to link no chaps 
 I don't wanna hear no talk about straps 
 The only thing I wanna pop is champagne 
 Until I collapse 
 I got drink yeah, man I got food 
 Come check me for the (?) rap 
 I heard you were looking for me 
 You don't need glasses, if you're looking for me 
 You don't need binoculars, if you're looking for me 
 You don't need to look far, if you're looking for me 
 I'm standing 
 In a corner 
 In a, in a corner 
 Some man are hard (?) 
 And go on like them are danger 
 In a corner 
 In a, in a corner 
 Some man are hard (?) 
 And go on like them are gangster 
 Yes, yes, yes Trigga 
 Very, very, terror (?) 
 I ain't come here to link no phone 
 I don't wanna hear no talk about chrome 
 Only thing I wanna pop is champagne 
 Until it's time to go home 
 I'm lean and I'm in my own zone 
 Skankin', bubbling like foam 
 Bouncin', like Snoop Dogg's car 
 Dancin', oh shit rah 
 Couple more mandem, wagwan dun 
 I don't wanna hear no talk about mash 
 Only thing I wanna pop is champagne 
 Until I run out of cash 
 "Yo, Sam, lend me a G" 
 You dunno the MySpace, forward slash 
 Well if you know Trigga, then you'll know Skepta 
 I'm the newest shadow deamon, coalition soldier 
 NASA, NASA, NASA, rocket launcher 
 I'm double dark, triple heavy like (?) 
 (Them gyal say we face, balaclava 
 Them gyal say we face, balaclava 
 A four and a nine, just a (?) 
 Say what they call me? Blood (?)) 
 {Dirty astronaut fly rocket super 
 Big money sound, sterling, paper 
 Gold teeth and gargan like Mr Ninja 
 No skin (?) when we're in a corner 
 Nasa, nasa 
 Yes} 
 A likkle darker 
 It's a likkle heavier
