 Blowing up shit like bomb in iraq 
 Didys in white I'm in all black 
 It's about to get real grimmy 
 So somebody say DJ pull up the track 
 Ow shut this down 
 Ain't hear nothing like this since pow 
 Ain't heard nothing like this so god forgive me if I buss my ting right now 
 Wow I blow my own trumpet 
 And if you don't like it lump it 
 I'm a uk bad boy just for the record I like tea but I don't like crumpets 
 Dirty money and boy better know together that's crazy as hell 
 Me and diddy got both hands on the big red button 
 Just say the word we shut down the world

 Ayo skepta 
 Walk into the club and I got two sexy girls on each side 
 Money in the bank but still I gotta stay on my grind 
 Man betta mention me when they talk about grime 
 And they told me to shut this down ima do it tonight ... ima do it tonight 
 I'm skpta I'm that guy 
 And I'm d-i-d-d-y 
 Boy betta know till I die 
 And you can't see me I'm way to fly 
 Chick stop and stare when I go by 
 Nigga's hate me and I don't know why 
 'Cause I've spent half my life in the sky 
 And I buy the things that you wanna buy 
 Yh take that don't stop 
 Give it to e'm girl 
 So hot gotta brand new shit back now gotta say hello good morning 
 Spending dirty money everywhere in the 5-0-4 new york to london 
 All you bithches can just sit back and watch how me and puffy own it 
 I get it we get money the man is acting funny 
 'Cause were jet setting taking all your real good money 
 Never seen a bad bitch buying nothing for nout with a mouth like this 
 Lying down with the 2-1-5 real niggas saying hi make it rock like this 
 Dirty money up in your area 
 Bitch ass niggas ain't scared of us 
 Come on be on time 
 Got you on my mind 
 Let you spend your money 
 And cruise it on your mind (get it) 
 I don't kiss and tell 
 But I'm gone kiss and tell 
 You everything that's on my heart so you can know me well... welll ...well ... 
 I walk into the club and I got two sexy girls on each side 
 Money in the bank but still I gotta stay on my grind 
 Man betta mention me when they talk about grime 
 And they told me to shut this down ima do it tonight ... ima do it tonight
