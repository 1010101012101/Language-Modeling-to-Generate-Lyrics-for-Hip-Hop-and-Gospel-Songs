They say "Skepta, you must get loads of girls" 
 The music's picked up now 
 Tell 'em like J2k, nah, it's all switched up now 
 She thinks that if she talks to me they'll call 
 Her a groupie behind her back now 
 So she stands far but close enough for her pictures 
 To have me in the background 
 I'm kinda used to it now 
 They say it's all part and parcel 
 And if it's this much for me 
 Imagine what's it's like for Curtis and Marshall 
 I wanna go hard 
 But my body keeps telling me to take it easy 
 So I sit here watching a DVD logo bounce around the TV 
 My life ended ages ago, now it's all a dream 
 Sitting here, thinking how this thing all started 
 From What D'Ya Mean, What D'Ya Mean 
 Now that I'm getting that paper I heard a couple man want me dead 
 So I went out bought a Gucci hat and put money on my own head 
 I forever hear people talking like I don't know about street 
 Fake gangstas must think I spent my music money on chocolate and sweets 
 You're looking for beef in London? Nah it's not hard to find it 
 But I'm not scared of a gun, it's all about the man behind it 
 You wanna make it big 
 You think you like what you see 
 You wanna make it big 
 You saw me go from the bottom to the top 
 Now you wanna be me 
 You wanna make it big 
 This famous life make people wanna wish they were 6 feet under 
 But not me 
 See when I made it big 
 I just wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger

 (Skepta - Verse 2) 
 Sometimes I think that I think too much 
 I start thinking about thinking 
 Then I start to get paranoid 
 I think my windows need tinting 
 They say why work all this time 
 To get famous Joseph 
 Just to wear sunglasses 
 Cause you don't wanna get noticed 
 Once in a while I take 'em off 
 And I'm like "arrr, that's too bright" 
 Because I sleep all day then I wake up at night 
 Then I phone my girl, see if she wants to link 
 She said she got work in the morning 
 So what do I do, I go out for a drink 
 I spend all my time in clubs 
 It's starting to feel like home 
 I don't wanna sit in the VIP but sometimes I just wanna be left alone 
 I hate when I'm in a bad mood and I see all my supporters vibes'n 
 And I apologies to anyone I've taking a pic with when I weren't smiling 
 They say "don't you remember me I met you at Party In The Park" 
 Babe, I can't even where I parked my car in the car park 
 Now she hates me and every time she hears my song she's changing the station 
 I swear the human brain weren't designed to deal with all this information 
 You still wanna make it big 
 You think you like what you see 
 You wanna make it big 
 You saw me go from the bottom to the top 
 Now you wanna be me 
 You wanna make it big 
 This famous life can make some people wish they were 6 feet under 
 But not me 
 You see when I made it big 
 I just wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger

 Listen tomorrow isn't promised to us so 
 You have to enjoy today 
 Cause the game is like a box of roses 
 'Cause when they're done with the chocalate 
 The wrapper gets thrown away 
 I said the wrapper gets thrown away 
 (Chipmunk) 
 When you're shooting for your targets 
 And its making you a target 
 You die before you live, I wish you warned me when I started 
 We're going full hearted, R.I.P the half wits 
 Cause now we're 6 feet under the top spot f-ck a casket 
 Bastards, don't we make the lifestyle look appealing 
 Independant names and chains 
 Skepta are we dreaming? 
 Nobody could season, this track couldn't reach him 
 Cause now I'm on the otherside of that glass ceiling 
 The underdogs are off the leash 
 Eh Joseph, pass the muzzles and the leads 
 The games full of demons, let's get this armhouse on 
 Everyone wants handouts but I ain't stretch armstrong 
 We've come so far as emcee's 
 Round of applause or bust it off just make it clap please 
 I'm so past just trying to be the favourite 
 You're nobody until you got some haters 
 But you still wanna make it BIG!
