Don't get carried away with me 
 'Cause I don't care if you want me baby 
 Girl don't get me wrong 'cause you got it goin' on 
 But your takin' too long 
 I'm a 100% no I'm not a zero 
 Even beyonce knowles ain't got such a big ego 
 But you ain't feelin' me so 
 Let me switch off the mic 
 'Cause I keep tweetin but you ain't tweetin me back 
 And I don't wanna act totally crazy so asta la vista baby 
 How can I be big like benny 
 Ur tryin' to make me feel small like temp 
 I musta been a fool back then 
 But you no what I don't wanna be your friend 
 Let alone your partner 
 I just hope that you don't believe in karma 
 'Cause it'll all come back ten times harder 
 Don't get carried away with me 
 'Cause I don't care if you want me baby 
 Girl don't get me wrong 'cause you got it goin' on 
 But your takin' too long 
 Ur takin' too long 
 Don't get carried away with me 
 'Cause I don't care if you want me baby 
 Girl don't get me wrong 'cause you got it goin' on 
 But your takin' too long 
 Ur takin' too long

 My phone asks me if I'm sure I wanna delete the number? 
 Yes 
 No further questions 
 I don't wanna read her statement 
 Its blatent 
 My name ain't adele so why am I chasin pavements? 
 Took me forgranted 
 Fort I was talkin' the hardest 
 She's like an internet gangster 
 She don't wanna show love to the artist 
 I just hope that you don't believe in karma 
 'Cause it will come back ten times harder 
 Trust me

 And you'll see I can be all you need 
 Oh I'm through
