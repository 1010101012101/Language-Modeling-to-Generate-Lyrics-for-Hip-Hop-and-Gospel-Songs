I told her to drink up 
 Select and play the song that I asked for 
 If you want to link up 
 Then you can meet me on the dancefloor 
 50 Cent can't dance like me 
 Soulja Boy can't dance like me 
 Michael Jackson can't dance like me 
 Yo, so 
 C c c Count with me 
 1. Glass of champagne for me 
 2. Glass of champagne for you 
 3. Now do the Rolex Sweep 
 Only got one bottle when I walked through the door 
 1 o'clock and I bought one more 
 2 o'clock I'm in the corner skanking 
 2:30 I bought one more 
 C c c Count with me 
 C c c Count with me 
 C c c Count with me 
 C c c Count with me 
 C c c Count with me 
 Do the Rolex Sweep 
 Do the Rolex Sweep 
 Do the Rolex Sweep 
 Do the Rolex Sweep
