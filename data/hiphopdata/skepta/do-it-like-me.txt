Fuck Skepta (x3) 
 Let me hear you say fuck Skepta 
 Fuck Skepta (x4) 
 He sold out 
 I sold out, Yeah 
 There weren't one ticket left not even a chair 
 I should send you a postcard, I wish you were here 
 I wish you could see, I wish you could hear 
 I make 'em scream 
 When I come true with the rest of the team 
 I get it pop-in mainstream, still I'm the best in the scene 
 So I can understand why everybody wants to do it like me 
 No you don't do it like me 
 Nah, no we ain't the same 
 You're never gonna do it I'm doin' it again 
 Boy Better Know, were moving too fast 
 You better move into a different lane 
 Oh what a shame 
 They though I weren't gonna bust, then I came 
 Took off the condom, made it rain 
 Left my stain all over the game 
 And these wanna be's wanna be me 
 They disrespect me then they beg me for a Re-tweet 
 Then we see them on the camera, walking, talking trynna do it like me 
 No you don't do it like me 
 I know a lot of man that think they do it like me 
 I know a lot of man that think they do it like me 
 They really, really, really think they do it like me 
 But no they don't do it like me 
 (x2) 
 You call it money, I call it a piece of paper 
 You think I'm a human being, Nah man I'm a freak of nature 
 Skepta I got the UK buzzing like a vibrator 
 Now my paper's looking higher than a sky scraper 
 Chipmunk told me don't watch no face 
 I'll never leave home without my pencil case 
 24/7 I stay with my eraser 
 Put it up in the sky, nice and high, wave it side to side 
 Screaming rub e'm out, rub e'm out 
 Goodbye hater 
 Cya wouldn't wanna be ya 
 Fuck your mix tape I don't wanna feature 
 Couldn't give a shit about your album either 
 I don't wanna hear you come out the speaker, No? 
 You ain't been to a show until you been to my Show? 
 If you're looking for some action man I'm G.I Joe 
 I'm killing it that's why them man are switching 
 They threw some dead punches, but I'm still alive and kicking 
 There's too many cooks in the kitchen, bitchin' trynna do it like me 
 No you don't do it like me 
 Guess who's in the city, it's going off 
 They know I got money, but I ain't showing off 
 I drop it like it's hot 
 Fuck how much doe it costs 
 Were blowing up 
 But you man are blowing off 
 Blad, you're blowing out 
 You told Logan you're Mix CD was finished 
 But you're constipated, your shit ain't coming out 
 Now know I got sick beats, and crazy vocals 
 MC's don't wanna see me on the scene I take it old school like 
 Nah rude boy, what d'ya mean, what d'ya mean, what d'ya mean you fool 
 Go on then, go on then draw for the tool 
 Think that you're hard but you're soft like wool 
 I will lick a man in the jaw side with a stool 
 I'm a real bad boy but I still look cool 
 White gold chains and a' I start drool 
 But they can't jack me becuz I'm not Ja rule 
 Nah rude boy what d'ya mean, what d'ya mean 
 I was born on September the 19th, don't care about February 14th 
 Pay me for my 16th before I start acting like it's Friday the 13th 
 With two black gloves and balaclava 
 C S gas and a meat cleaver 
 Pay me for my halfa 
 Before I start chopping off heads like King Arthur 
 People here are starting to hear you as the King of grime because you're the one person that has stuck by this genre of music, 
 I'm the, I'm the guy that we love this music I love grime world. 
 If there was a room, you get me, and a microphone and a PC lock me in there, 
 I'm coming out with tunes, oh yeah maybe years old (?) 
 But there ain't no one else that does it like me
