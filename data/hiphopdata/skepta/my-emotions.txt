Listen to my emotions, I'm letting out 
 She came in a taxi, I'm watching her when she's getting out 
 It's that pretty face and the sexy body that I'm checking out 
 And I nearly died when I saw them Ed Hardy shoes stepping out 
 You know how much work I put into get this princess to my place 
 We can take it fast, take it slow, princess this ain't a race 
 Kiss my neck, kiss my chest and kiss below my waist 
 What happens in the bedroom, stays in the bedroom 
 I ain't watching faze 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 I ain't playing with you, this ain't no game 
 We can look at each other in the mirror, who said that we can't be vain? 
 Then I turn you 'round, pick you up so you can see my name 
 I'm looking in your eyes so deep, I think I see your brain 
 Your sexy voice sounds sweet to the ear like a song Bob Marley sang 
 I wanna throw you in a ring, give you a body drop and a power slam 
 The way I start whistling in the bedroom, just call me Macho Man 
 Or call me Junior, call me Joseph or Ed Hardy Dan 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 We ain't together so there's no breaking up 
 And it don't look like we're gonna argue so there's no making up 
 I can tell that I'm doing the right thing by the way she's shaking up 
 And I swear princess if this is a dream then I ain't waking up because 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head 
 You're doing a madness to my head
