What did Bob Marley sing for 
 What did Rosa Parks fight for 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 'Cause if Martin Luther King saw Vybz Kartel hit Ninja at Sting he would've told Adams to lock up the whole ting 
 'Cause if you wanna sing then sing 
 But if you wanna be some Rocky Balboa then put on your boxing gloves and jump in the boxing ring 
 Exactly, that's what I thought 
 You're not a Mike Tyson, you're more like a Don King blud 
 We need to stop all the fighting, stop the stabbing 
 Stop the shooting guns 
 Everyday mums are losing sons 
 14 year old kids are bagging up q's and crumbs 
 And I don't think Mr Wilberforce would've killed a north man 'cause he was from east 
 Start looking at each other as brothers 
 Stick together, increase the peace 
 What did Bob Marley sing for 
 What did Rosa Parks fight for 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 Tell me what did Haile Selassie preach for 
 What did Malcolm X die for 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 It's like these guys play too much xbox 
 Shooting guys in the headtops 
 Think that I sound like a fed boss 
 But I'm sick of the gun talk, get lost 
 I'm not telling you how to live life though 
 Just put down your gun and your knife bro 
 Taking a next man's life ain't blessed and 25 years in the cells not live fool 
 I know life's not easy, so why you making it harder 
 Once you die there ain't no after 
 Lifes not a ITV drama 
 You might think I sound like a preacher 
 Na Shorty's more like a teacher 
 So rudeboy put down your guns and think with your brain and not with your heater 
 What did Bob Marley sing for 
 What did Rosa Parks fight for 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 People must think it's funny 
 Tell me what did Haile Selassie preach for 
 What did Malcolm X die for 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 The youth of today handling firearms like it's nothing 
 Taking life's over drugs and money 
 Back when I was a kid all I wanted was scale electrics 
 But all these millennium kids wanna take your life 'cause you're from next bits 
 What happened to playing pogs and marbels and conkers 
 There's a new game they play now and it's called go bonkers 
 That's what the adults call it, but we ain't saying it right 
 Cause the kids got a better name for it and they call it life 
 What did Bob Marley sing for 
 What did Rosa Parks fight for 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 People must think it's funny 
 Tell me what did Haile Selassie preach for 
 What did Malcolm X die for 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway 
 If we gonna kill each other anyway
