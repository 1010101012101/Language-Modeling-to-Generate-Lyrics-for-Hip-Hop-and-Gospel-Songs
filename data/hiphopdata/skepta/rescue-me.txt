I've been breaking it down for you baby 
 Running around, I can't see no love for me 
 Somebody rescue me 
 I'm the king of the town mr crazy 
 Creating a sound still no love for me 
 Somebody rescue me, just rescue me 
 Meee 
 They call me S K EPTA before I start I just wanna say 
 Boy you better know what I mean 
 I've got bumblebees tryin' to figure out how I got this buzz 
 All I want is a kiss and a hug 
 But somebody told specsavers I can't see no love 
 Days, Months years. 
 Blood, sweat, tears I walk the streets of london facing my fears 
 Everyday's like truth or dare, so spin that bottle 
 Beacuse if it lands on me imma stay true to my word 
 And I don't want anymore respect than I deserve 
 Well I've been braking it down for you baby 
 Running around, l can't see no love for me 
 Somebody rescue me 
 I'm the king of the town mr crazy 
 Creating a sound, still no love for me 
 Somebody rescue me, just rescue me 
 Rescue meeee 
 Juss, no ceiling, I walk all over the beat no floors 
 She says I love you loads, I say I love you more 
 They say I've changed, I say I'm changin 
 I left the wrong girl, got a lady I don't get no thanks 
 No round of applause 
 But I keep on trying I'm upset but I keep on sighing 
 When I get knocked out, I get back on my own two feet 
 I keep on fighting, I sacrifised gravity so I could live my dream 
 Because reality is far from the place I'd like to be 
 Well I've been braking it down for you baby 
 Running around, l can't see no love for me 
 Somebody rescue me 
 I'm the king of the town mr crazy 
 Creating a sound, still no love for me 
 Somebody rescue me, just rescue me
