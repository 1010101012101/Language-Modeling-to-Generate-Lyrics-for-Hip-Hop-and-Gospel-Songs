Is it the champagne dance? No 
 This is the champagne talk 
 Pop goes the cork the champagne pours 
 Stop hold the thought, wait pause 
 I see a girl in the distance 
 Making me weak like a premature infant 
 If she ever knew how much I wanna get my hands on her 
 She would have thought I was O.J. Simpson 
 But I gotta take my time, yes 
 Fink of the perfect rhyme at the same time 
 I don't wanna loose this race 
 'Cause I see a lot of man on the startin' line 
 Wanna be the first man on the finishin' line 
 But you know what she's so hot 
 I'll be more than happy to take it slow 'cause 
 I'm not in a rush, rush 
 'Cause she lookin' so lush, lush, slow down 
 I'm not in a rush, rush 
 'Cause she lookin' so lush, lush, so slow it down 
 I'm not in a rush 
 This ain't the drink talkin' here 
 But ever since I walked in here 
 I've been investigating you 
 Like inspector Morse in here 
 Your the kind of girl I would wife 
 Got me thinkin' what the babies would look like 
 Then a think twice like slow down Joseph 
 What I really wanna know is 
 One, what you drinkin'? 
 Two, what you thinkin'? 
 And three, who you linkin'? 
 'Cause I hope he's not here 
 That's a beautiful face you got there 
 And you know what? You're so hot 
 I'll be more than happy to take it slow 'cause 
 I'm not in a rush, rush 
 'Cause she lookin' so lush, lush, slow down 
 I'm not in a rush, rush 
 'Cause she lookin' so lush, lush, so slow it down 
 I'm not in a rush, rush 
 'Cause she lookin' so lush, lush, slow down 
 I'm not in a rush, rush 
 'Cause she lookin' so lush, lush, so slow it down 
 I'm not in a rush, I'm not in a rush 
 I'm not in a rush, rush 
 'Cause she lookin' so lush, lush, slow down 
 I'm not in a rush, rush 
 'Cause she lookin' so lush, lush, so slow it down 
 I'm not in a rush, rush 
 'Cause she lookin' so lush, lush, slow down 
 I'm not in a rush, rush 
 'Cause she lookin' so lush, lush, so slow it down 
 I'm not in a rush
