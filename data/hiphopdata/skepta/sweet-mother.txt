Sweet mother I no go forget you 
 For the suffer wey you suffer for me 
 Mom, mom, mom you know you're my number one 
 Mom you know you're my number one 
 And I know actions speak louder than words too but I'm telling you now I love you mom 
 I love you mom 
 For all the big things and all the little little stuff you've done 
 And I know actions speak loud, but they can't speak louder than the crowd 
 When I say you were ...? rude to my mumsie 
 I'm a nice guy but I can get ugly 
 I'm a grime guy bit I can get funky 
 And me without mom is like cornflakes without the milk 
 I love my mom like garnet silk 
 But I don't wanna get locked up like .? 
 So God forgive me If I bust my nine 
 Sweet mother I no go forget you 
 For the suffer wey you suffer for me 
 Listen to this mom 
 This songs worth much more than a kiss mom 
 Worth more than a bracelet on the wrist mom 
 And you know me dad, I'm your first son 
 And I will never let nobody diss mom 
 I don't know another love like this mom 
 How can your love make me happy as Larry 
 But still sometimes make cry like ...? mom 
 Mom Better Know that I will always take care of two younger brothers and my sis mom 
 I know we argue, but it's all crisp mom 
 Me and JME are like ...? mom 
 It's okay leave that sit down 
 You just made it through let me wash up the dish mom 
 You deserve it, you gave birth to two of the biggest grime artist in the bizz mom 
 Sweet mother I no go forget you 
 For the suffer wey you suffer for me 
 I love you mom, it's the deepest love 
 The deepest feeling 
 And if you love your mom 
 Let me see your middle finger and index finger touching the ceiling 
 And say 'BRRAP' 'BRRAP' 
 'Cause if it wasn't for your mom you wouldn't be breathing 
 And I know I don't normally MC like this 
 But you know what it's not a MC ting 
 I'm not a ...? son 
 That's not me don 
 I love my sweet mom 
 She brought me up properly 
 She never let me come home at all hours of the evening 
 'Cause when I was bad, she made me stand in the corner 
 And put my hands up 
 It was either that or get a beating 
 Sweet mother I no go forget you 
 For the suffer wey you suffer for me
