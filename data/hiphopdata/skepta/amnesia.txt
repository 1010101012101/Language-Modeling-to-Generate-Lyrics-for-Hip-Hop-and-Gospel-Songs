Somebody remind me what happened last night 'cause I can't remember a thing 
 I think they call this Amnesia 
 Feel like I've been in a sleeper 
 I think they call this Amnesia 
 Skepta 
 Last night was Sick, oh what a city. 
 I lost my phone though oh what a pity 
 When I woke up I found a note that said. Sorry I had to go Ily 
 I looked around this can't be real 
 'Cause I don't recognize this 
 Then I saw the minibar and I was like Rarr 
 Somebody terrorised it. 
 Not even a bottle of water 
 Make it worse this room was hotter than a sauna ... 
 So I jumped up got ready. 
 Went downstairs to the hotel lobby. 
 Man are like swear down you're a mad man skeppy, I must have had one to many 
 'Cause I can't remember anything after the two yager misters and a bottle of henny 
 Somebody remind me what happened last night 'cause I can't remember a thing 
 This must be what it means. 
 Feel like I've been in a sleeper.

 Who you trying to diss? Who did you fight with? Who did you kiss? Who did you dance with? 
 Who did you lits? 
 Awww man, you were a Myth! 
 I remember walking in Blinded by the lights 
 Look left, Look right 
 Saw 2 Men That I don't Like But I already lit up the room when I walked in 
 No need for fireworks tonight unless it's on the side of a bottle 
 And I'm only here for one night on the high, So I'm trying to find me a Model 
 We circled the party once, 
 Nothing Twice, Dead 
 Third time around I saw a girl I tuck into bed 
 Two minutes later, I'm at the bar. 
 Doing shots of yagar 
 That's when I blacked out. 
 Anything after that's all a Myth 
 Like lorrie ager, Major

 Awww man, you were a Myth! 
 Had one drink, two drink, three drink, four, had one too many, now you're laying on the floor 
 Had one drink, two drink, three drink, four, had one too many, now you're laying on the floor 
 You lost your phone, you lost your friends 
 Here comes that classic line 
 I'm never drinking again 
 Thought you were casually drinking 
 But you were actually binging 
 Woke up somewhere you've never been too In your whole life 
 And now your thinking
