You know me I'm super kool 
 But nobody can take me for a fool 
 'Cause when I start loading up my tool it's where you are. 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could you be so hearltess? 
 Yo yo I why would you do? 
 It like you want another biggie and 2 pac sinario 
 I thought you knew that 
 Skepta I get heartless like bushkin and mighty mouth 
 I'm 26 now 
 I'm partying with some porn star chicks now now 
 After I give her my kit kat chuncky ez for the twix now 
 See I came from the block like jenny lopez 
 And now my whole family have got no stress 
 I love crusing in my 350z 
 If it's a drive by pass me the moped 
 You know me I'm super kool 
 But nobody can take me for a fool 
 'Cause when I start loading up my tool it's where you are. 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could you be so hearltess? 
 Boy better know that's my click 
 I know my team are getting paid and you don't like 
 I used to show off with pinky notes now I just take my card out and I swipe it 
 Ain't got time for no beef with no children your talking to the champion like I was paris hilton 
 You better know I'm a tottenham simple soldier big up mr wilson 
 Round here we don't like you 
 Switch off that MC put on my tune 
 And if I don't listen to your shit lyrics then how the fuck did I bite you? 
 You know me I'm super kool 
 But nobody can take me for a fool 
 'Cause when I start loading up my tool it's where you are. 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 How could you be so heartless? 
 Boy better know 
 How could you be so hearltess?
