Are you ready? 
 Well, yeah 
 Always ready, the black Nigerian's way to heavy 
 Every time I open my mouth blud 
 I say a lyric and another MC gets buried 
 Yeah, six feet under 
 Leave a whole in your jumper 
 When the big skeng rings out like a private number 
 Ring, ring talk to answer machine 
 Yo, Frisco pass the machine 
 I just wanna do my part for the scene 
 I'm a big man but they wanna see me act like I'm 15 
 No fam, it's a big man ting 
 So please stop watching the whip man's in 
 I don't wanna be no funky house DJ 
 But they got me on a wig man ting 
 You can't threaten me with no badman 
 Talk I'm not scared, sorry man 
 You can't threaten me with no badman 
 Talk I'm not scared, sorry man 
 You can't threaten me with no badman 
 Talk I'm not scared, sorry man 
 I seen so much now I don't give a monkeys 
 Swing from tree to tree just like monkeys 
 So man wanna war me, record me 
 Lights camera action 
 Who produces anthem after anthem 
 Me 
 Skepta, the microphone champion 
 Some people can't see you will never win a lyrical war with me 
 So I'm gonna call this one lord of the mics part 3 
 And murder another 25 MC's, so dig me a larger grave 
 Spray my ting like aftershave 
 It's gonna be a par today 
 When your heart beat stops 
 And you pass away 
 Trust me it's all easy to me 
 I'm champagne, you're lambrini to me 
 Don't know why you're talking greezy to me 
 When I'm Rodney Price your Beeny to me 
 You can't threaten me with no badman 
 Talk I'm not scared, sorry man 
 You can't threaten me with no badman 
 Talk I'm not scared, sorry man 
 You can't threaten me with no badman 
 Talk I'm not scared, sorry man 
 I seen so much now I don't give a monkeys 
 Swing from tree to tree just like monkeys 
 They wanna run it up but like armor said 
 It's nothing leave them 
 Bare skeng talk I can't believe them 
 Red and white R6 I'll leave them 
 Ed Hardy glasses, I can't see them 
 So why you talking like you can't die 
 One bullet in each lung breath then 
 You see your sounding weezy 
 And I heard your CD 
 You and your man them are talking greezy 
 I just tell a man like D-E-E 
 Come on, come on 
 Do you really think if I give to shits if your greezy? 
 I don't think so, you man ain't seen greezy yet 
 All my man them pop it off 
 Your man will fly off into the sky like easy jet 
 You can't threaten me with no badman 
 Talk I'm not scared, sorry man 
 You can't threaten me with no badman 
 Talk I'm not scared, sorry man 
 You can't threaten me with no badman 
 Talk I'm not scared, sorry man 
 I seen so much now I don't give a monkeys 
 Swing from tree to tree just like monkeys 
 Are you ready?
