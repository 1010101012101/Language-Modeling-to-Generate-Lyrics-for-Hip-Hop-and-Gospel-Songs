We were chillin' 
 Then we had sex 
 In the kitchen 
 In the shower 
 In my bed 
 On the couch 
 In other words we had sex all over the house 
 All over the house 
 All over the house (x3) 
 She came closer 
 I popped up like bread in a toaster 
 All right all right foreplays over 
 I stuck her up on the wall like a poster 
 Then I told her 
 Let me show you something you won't forget 
 Just hold me by the neck 
 And ill pick you up by the legs 
 She said junior don't drop me 
 I said baby I do this properly 
 Just kiss me 
 Close your eyes, hold on tight like the rest is history 
 Now I got princess open 
 Like a birthday card I'm gonna show her around the house and sell her the yard smooth 
 We were chillin' 
 Then we had sex 
 In the kitchen 
 In the shower 
 In my bed 
 On the couch 
 In other words we had sex all over the house 
 All over the house 
 All over the house (x3) 
 She knows I've got this 
 Imma open it up like a locksmith 
 We put on a DVD knowing for well we ain't gonna watch it. 
 We get about ten minutes in to it we start to get intimate, 
 Hugging, kissing, touching, licking 
 Then we take it to the kitchen 
 We don't care if the neighbours are listening 
 It's kinda cold down here 
 But we don't think about that when I sink in 
 And when she starts pulling that face 
 That's when I grab hold of her waist 
 And Imma make sure we both finish at the same time 
 Cause baby this ain't no race smooth 
 We were chillin' 
 Then we had sex 
 In the kitchen 
 In the shower 
 In my bed 
 On the couch 
 In other words we had sex all over the house 
 All over the house 
 All over the house (x3) 
 She's giving me come to bed eyes 
 I need to come correct I'm 
 She loves my XL size 
 I wanna be between those thighs 
 All over the house 
 Front room she opens the blouse 
 Had a body like wow 
 No time for the bedroom I had to act now 
 And I was like hey pretty missy 
 The way your looking is oh so pretty 
 To lose this moment would be a pity 
 But this ain't sex ain't city 
 This is sex kitchen 
 This is sex on the floor 
 Animalistic going on all 4s 
 Working in the house but this ain't a chore smooth 
 We were chillin' 
 Then we had sex 
 In the kitchen 
 In the shower 
 In my bed 
 On the couch 
 In other words we had sex all over the house 
 All over the house 
 All over the house (x3) 
 She hadnt seen me in ages 
 I came in gave her a kiss on the lips and took off my rucksack and trainers 
 Let me flick forward a couple pages 
 Then it all started 
 1 word, outrageous 
 In and out like CD changes 
 Our bodies exchanging flavours 
 I put her on a table 
 Moved all the papers 
 Her legs high up in the air 
 Non stop like bassline ravers 
 Then we went to the bedroom 
 On the floor, move the straigtners 
 The way we were all over the house 
 Thought we were all painters smooth 
 We were chillin' 
 Then we had sex 
 In the kitchen 
 In the shower 
 In my bed 
 On the couch 
 In other words we had sex all over the house 
 All over the house 
 All over the house (x3) 
 (Instrumental) 
 In other words all had sex all over the house 
 All over the house (x5)
