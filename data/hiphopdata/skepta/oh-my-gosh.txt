Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Here we go again 
 I got locked up by the po po again 
 I've been in here since half past ten 
 It's half past two now, when is all this gonna end 
 I only had one phone call 
 So I used it to call my best friend 
 I told him, "Get all the stuff out the house 
 Before the po po come searching the prem" 
 The fed keeps looking at me through the flap 
 Blad, go check somebody else 
 He took my shoelaces and took my belt 
 We both know there's no way I can hang myself 
 One minute, I saw blue lights 
 The next minute, I'm getting read my rights 
 Officer, the cuffs are way too tight 
 Your taking the piss out my life, it's a hype 
 When I woke up this morning 
 I never thought I'd be sitting in a cell 
 On a blue mat no blanket, yawning 
 Hoping that I get bail 
 Mum said that I gotta change my ways 
 But I'm a typical man, wanna be a boss 
 But then I got shift like, oh, my days 
 Now I'm sitting in the cell like, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Na, no, I don't wanna cup of tea 
 Just press R-E-C-O-R-D 
 My name's Joe, all I just wanna say N-O 
 C-O double M-E-N-T 
 Only thing I know about is me 
 Chat about next man, I can't hear or see 
 Never talk on behalf of my co-D 
 And I don't want a quiet word with a PC 
 I don't wanna cigarette, no I don't smoke 
 And I definitely don't wanna bust no joke 
 I know blacks but I don't know brown 
 No, I don't like fizzy drinks, I don't know about no coke 
 One minute, I saw blue lights 
 The next minute, I'm getting read my rights 
 Officer, the cuffs are way too tight 
 Your taking the piss out my life, it's a hype 
 When I woke up this morning 
 I never thought I'd be sitting in a cell 
 On a blue mat no blanket, yawning 
 Hoping that I get bail 
 Mum said that I gotta change my ways 
 But I'm a typical man, wanna be a boss 
 But then I got shift like, oh, my days 
 Now I'm sitting in the cell like, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 Oh, my days, oh, my gosh 
 When I woke up this morning
