Baby, talk to me 
 What is going on 
 Cause lately 
 We ain't been 
 Spendin time alone 
 Last night 
 When I touched your hand 
 You didn't wanna hold 
 Today 
 No kiss goodbye 
 Jus said you had to go 
 If you're leavin' me, baby 
 I just wanna know

 If you're done with me, baby 
 I just wanna know 
 I just wanna know

 If you care 
 Something you wanna say? 
 Please don't 
 Don't hold it back 
 It'll come out someday 
 I am 
 I'm strong enough 
 To mend my broken heart (oh yeaa) 
 If you say 
 That you and i 
 Are betta off apart 
 If you're leavin' me, baby

 If you're done with me, baby
