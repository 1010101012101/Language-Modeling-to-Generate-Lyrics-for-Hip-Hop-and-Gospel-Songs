They build you up to watch you fall, 
 Tell you, you can do it all, 
 But they really wanna see you down in 
 The shadows. 
 'Cause they can't ever learn to fly, 
 They don't wanna see you in the sky, 
 But they really wanna see you down in 
 The shadows. 
 (I know I know) they don't believe in us 
 (I know I know) we're meant to be 
 Because, 
 We both share our lives in the light 
 And I Say... 
 They ain't never go'n get us [x4] 
 Tell me are these words familiar, 
 That man, he ain't good enough, 
 But they really wanna see you down in 
 The shadows. 
 They wont tell it to your face, 
 All you gotta do is fall from grace, 
 But they really wanna see you down in 
 The shadows. 
 I know I know they don't believe in us, 
 I know I know we're meant to be 
 Because, 
 We both Share our lives in the light. 
 They don't know about the things we 
 Do, They don't understand it's just us 
 Two, 
 Why they always tryina intervene, They 
 Don't understand that it's our dream, 
 Well, to the left, to the left, we should 
 Tell them to get to the left, 
 Why they always tryina intervene, They 
 Don't understand that it's our dream...
