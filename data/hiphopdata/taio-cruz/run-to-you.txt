Whenever I'm left in the cold 
 Whenever there's pain in my soul 
 Whenever I'm losing control 
 And I feel like I'm all alone 
 Whenever I'm lost and confused 
 Whenever it's hard to break through 
 The only thing left I can do is run 
 And I 
 I run to you, always 
 I run to you, always 
 Whenever I think of your face 
 When everything's going my way 
 And I'm having one of those days 
 When everything falls into place 
 You've always been right by my side 
 And I trust you with all of my life 
 If you're ever in need of me 
 I, oh I, will run, oh yeah 
 'Cause I run to you, always 
 And I run to you, always 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 I run to you 
 I run to you 
 I run to you 
 Always, always 
 I run to you always 
 I run to you always, oh 
 I said, I run to you always, oh 
 I run to you, always, always
