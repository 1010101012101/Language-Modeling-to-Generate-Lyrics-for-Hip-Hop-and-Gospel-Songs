Taio Cruz - I'll Never Love Again 
 Lyrics by 脚本小子 
 I was wrong to let you walk right out of my life. 
 I was dumb to think that I could survive, 
 Was a fool to think the grass was 
 Greener on the other side. 
 Now it hurts to know that it means that i, 
 I'll never love again, never never, 
 I'll never love again, never never, 
 I'll never love again, never never, 
 I'll never love again, never never, 
 Hey hey, 
 I'll never find nobody who can love me like you do, 
 I'll never find nobody to treat me the way you do, 
 I'll never find nobody else babe, I'll never fall in love again, 
 I was stupid to think that any love could compare to the love that you gave to me from you, 
 Was a fool, yes a fool to think that I'd find anywhere, 
 Anyone is better for me then you, 
 I'll never love again, never never, 
 I'll never love again, never never, 
 I'll never love again, never never, 
 I'll never love again, never never, 
 I'll never find nobody who can love me like you do, 
 I'll never find nobody to treat me the way you do, 
 I'll never find nobody else babe, I'll never fall in love again, 
 And now my heart is stone cold because you've gone, gone away, gone away 
 And now my heart is stone cold because you've gone, gone away, gone away 
 And now my heart is stone cold because you've gone, gone away, gone away 
 And now my heart is stone cold because you've gone, gone away, gone away 
 Gone away, gone away, gone away, gone away, gone away, gone away, gone away 
 I'll never love again, never never, 
 I'll never love again, never never, 
 I'll never love again, never never, 
 I'll never love again, never never, 
 I'll never find nobody who can love me like you do, 
 I'll never find nobody to treat me the way you do, 
 I'll never find nobody else babe, I'll never fall in love again, 
 I'll never find nobody who can love me like you do, 
 I'll never find nobody to treat me the way you do, 
 I'll never find nobody else babe, I'll never fall in love again...
