Here you are... again.sitting at our placement hill 
 Can't believe that you would be so cold 
 I know that you wanna be 
 With somebody new and that's cool with me 
 But this right here is just so cold 
 Didn't I give you all the things that I said I would 
 Didn't I take you to the places that I said I would 
 Didn't I give you the love that I said I would 
 Tell me how could you go 
 Can't give my love away [x6] 
 So cold. 
 How could you give him all the love that I gave you 
 How could you show him all the things that I showed you 
 How could you take him to the places that I took you 
 So cold 
 I'm hoping now my eyes to see cause this really can't be what I see 
 I won't believe that you would be so cold. 
 The house we bought for you and I. that we made love is ways lies 
 But this right here is just so cold. 
 Didn't I give you all the things that I said I would 
 Didn't I take you to all the places that I said I would 
 Didn't I give you the love that I said I would 
 Tell me how could you go 
 Can't give my love away [x6] 
 Tell me how could you go
