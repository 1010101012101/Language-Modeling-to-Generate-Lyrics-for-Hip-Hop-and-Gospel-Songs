 Even though their tryin' knock me over 
 I never fall down 
 'Cause I'm gonna wear a crown 
 With my feet on the ground

 Watch me so I tear the sky 
 And fly now

 To everything I know that makes me so strong 
 Oh na na 
 And hold on 
 Oh na na

 I raise my voice to them and say 
 Although they try to knock me down 
 I'm gonna stand up, gonna stand my ground 
 I'm gonna open up my heart to give yeah 
 Because it's the only way to live 
 I'm gonna be positive yeah 
 Positive X 4 
 Even though you tryin' pull me under 
 I never drown now 
 So I'm gonna rock the wave up 
 Not going down now 
 That's why I'm gonna fiii-ght 
 And stand up for my riii-ght 
 Come on take my hand 
 And lets unite now
