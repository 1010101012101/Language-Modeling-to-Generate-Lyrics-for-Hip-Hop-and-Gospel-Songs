She's my everything 
 Like a morning girl 
 She's my angel up above my world 
 She's the only one who understands me 
 That's why I call her my new fan league 
 She's the only one that I want by my side 
 She's the only one that I believe can save my life 
 She makes me want to be a better man for a while 
 She's higher than the sky 
 The suns and the moon 
 She's like a star, like a star, like a star.

 First let me say, she's the best of me 
 Is it cliche to say she's destiny 
 There's no one else but her 
 Well at least for me 
 That's exactly why I must now repeat that 
 She's the only one that I want by my side 
 She's the only one that I believe can save my life 
 She makes me want to be a better man for a while 
 She's higher than the sky 
 The suns and the moon 
 She's like a star, like a star, like a star.

 She's my star, my light, starry night 
 Aviator shades 'cause she shines so bright 
 Beats on the key five songs I write 
 Just so I can take on them g five flights 
 Yeah she's my type, just my height 
 She's my fit, she's just right 
 She's like, I think we might go far 
 I'm like, you right 
 You can be my angel wings 
 Her voice sound like an angel sings 
 Yeah I'll be back with the trademark strings 
 Just tryna compliment the sound she brings 
 She's like, we could go far 
 I'm like, you you you are 
 I'm like, you you you are 
 You are my guiding star 
 She's like a star, like a star, like a star.
