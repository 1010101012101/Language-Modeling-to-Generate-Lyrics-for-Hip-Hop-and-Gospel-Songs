Tell me, are you feeling strong? 
 Strong enough to love someone 
 And make it through the hardest storm 
 And bad weather 
 Will you pull me from the flames? 
 Hold me 'til I feel no pain 
 And give me shelter from the rain 
 Forever 
 Where can I find her? 
 She took the light and left me in the dark 
 She left me with a broken heart ah 
 Now I'm on my own 
 If anybody sees her 
 Shine a light on her ah 
 Shine a light on her 
 Shine a light on her ah 
 If anybody sees her 
 Tell me can you hear my voice? 
 Loud and clear above the noise 
 And even if I had the choice 
 I would not give up 
 Where can I find her? 
 She took the light and left me in the dark 
 She left me with a broken heart 
 Now I'm on my own 
 If anybody sees her 
 Shine a light on her 
 Shine a light on her 
 Shine a light on her 
 If anybody sees her 
 Shine a light on her 
 Shine a light on her 
 Shine a light on her 
 If anybody sees her 
 She took the light and left me in the dark 
 She left me with a broken heart 
 Now I'm on my own 
 If anybody sees her 
 Shine a light on her 
 Shine a light on her 
 Shine a light on her 
 If anybody sees her 
 Shine a light on her 
 Shine a light on her 
 Shine a light on her 
 If anybody sees her
