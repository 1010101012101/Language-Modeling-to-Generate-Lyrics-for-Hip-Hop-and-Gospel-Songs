On and on 
 My mind is turning 
 Feelings won't obey 
 My sleep is gone, my eyes are burning 
 All that I can say 
 I can't believe the way I treated u 
 I didn't know how much I needed u 
 And now I don't know what I'm gonna do 
 All I know - I'm still learning 
 And now I'm mad 'cause it's so clear 
 I didn't see why you were here 
 I didn't mean to make you disappear 
 All I know is I'm Lonely ... [3x] 
 I'm without you girl and now I know what it means to be 
 Lonely [3x] 
 I'm without you girl and now I know what it means to be 
 Lonely 
 And now I'm sorry girl for leaving u (eh, eh) 
 I'm sorry ... 
 And in this crowd I can't connect 
 Because my mind won't leave u 
 Tired of faking conversation 
 When all I want to say ... 
 I can't believe the way I treated u 
 I didn't know how much I needed u 
 And now I don't know what I'm gonna do 
 All I know - I'm still learning 
 And now I'm mad 'cause it's so clear 
 I didn't see why you were here 
 I didn't mean to make you disappear 
 All I know is I'm 
 Lonely [3x] 
 I'm without you girl and now I know what it means to be 
 Lonely [3x] 
 I'm without you girl and now I know what it means to be 
 Lonely 
 And now I'm sorry girl for leaving u (eh, eh) 
 I'm sorry girl for leaving u (eh, eh) [3x] 
 I'm sorry 
 U know a thousand girls can not replace u 
 Replace u, yeah 
 When u're the only one I wanna talk to 
 Without you I'm 
 Lonely [3x] 
 I'm without you girl and now I know what it means to be 
 Lonely [3x] 
 I'm without you girl and now I know what it means to be 
 Lonely 
 And now I'm sorry girl for leaving u (eh, eh) 
 I'm sorry girl for leaving u (eh, eh) [3x] 
 I'm sorry
