 You got me and I could not defend her 
 I tried but I had to surrender 
 Your star got me under the spellbound 
 Left me no other choice but to get down 
 It's too late (x4) 
 You got it (x4) 
 When I look into your eyes it's over 
 You got me hooked with your love controller 
 I'm tripping and I can not get over 
 I'm feeling lucky like a four leaf clover 
 'Cause I'm into you 
 I'm into you (x2) 
 Yeah 
 I'm into you (x3) 
 Yeah 
 Na na na na na na na na na yeah (x4)

 Sharp shooter you can call me the cyon 
 I'm not the one easy to get to 
 But all of that changed baby when I met you 
 It's too late (x4) 
 You got it (x4) 
 When I look into your eyes it's over 
 You got me hooked with your love controller 
 I'm tripping and I can not get over 
 I'm feeling lucky like a four leaf clover 
 'Cause I'm into you

 We can get it on if you're feeling my world

 And I'm listening to how you're grooving 
 So if you need me just call on the cruise 
 We can be whatever that you want in the news 
 But, I'm on it and you on it and we on it 
 So baby just tell me now 
 When I look into your eyes it's over 
 You got me hooked with your love controller 
 I'm tripping and I can not get over 
 I'm feeling lucky like a four leaf clover
