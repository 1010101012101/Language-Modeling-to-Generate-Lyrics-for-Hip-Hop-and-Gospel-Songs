Now I know how to get down on the floor (floor), 
 Experienced in moves you can't ignore ('nore), 
 But something 'bout this beat just got me hooked (hooked), 
 Come over here and take a closer look (a look). 
 'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough, 
 I can't stay on the ground (woah), 
 And I can't get enough, I can't get enough, 
 This is taking me now. 
 It's taking me higher, higher, 
 Higher off the ground, 
 It's taking me higher, higher, 
 Higher off the ground. 
 I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill (thrill), 
 I got this high without takin' a pill (a pill), 
 This move has got me way over the sun, 
 I'm dancin' like I am the only one (the one). 
 'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough, 
 I can't stay on the ground (woah), 
 And I can't get enough, I can't get enough, 
 This is taking me now. 
 It's taking me higher, higher, 
 Higher off the ground, 
 It's taking me higher, higher, 
 Higher off the ground. 
 The music's got me going higher, 
 I feel like I can touch the sky... 
 It's taking me higher, higher, 
 Higher off the ground, 
 It's taking me higher, higher, 
 Higher off the ground. 
 It's taking me higher, higher, 
 Higher off the ground, 
 It's taking me higher, higher, 
 Higher off the ground.
