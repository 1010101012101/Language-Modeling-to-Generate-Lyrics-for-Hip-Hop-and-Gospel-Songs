Now I know how to get down on the floor 
 Experience the moves you can't ignore 
 But something 'bout this beat that's got me hooked 
 Come over here and take a closer look 
 'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough 
 I can't stay on the ground 
 Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough 
 This is taking me now 
 It's taking me higher, higher 
 Higher off the ground 
 It's taking me higher, higher 
 Higher off the ground 
 Now I know how to get down on the floor 
 Experience the moves you can't ignore 
 This groove has got me way over the sun 
 I'm dancin' like I am the only one 
 'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough 
 I can't stay on the ground 
 Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough 
 This is taking me now 
 It's taking me higher, higher 
 Higher off the ground 
 It's taking me higher, higher 
 Higher off the ground 
 The music's got me going higher 
 I feel like I can touch the sky 
 It's taking me higher, higher 
 Higher off the ground 
 It's taking me higher, higher 
 Higher off the ground 
 It's taking me higher, higher 
 Higher off the ground 
 It's taking me higher, higher 
 Higher off the ground
