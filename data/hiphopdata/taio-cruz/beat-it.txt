(Beat it, beat it) 
 Girl, what the hell was you thinking 'bout 
 You really think I won't gon' find out 
 And how you gonna' bring him into my house 
 Feet up on my couch, kissin' on this dude 
 I should jus' (uh) 
 Do some shit I know I would regret 
 Spin his head like a piroette 
 Get real evil with some ciggarettes 
 Uh huh you don't understand huh 
 Before I get mad girl you should 
 Beat it (beat it) 
 I think you should get out 
 Beat it (beat it) 
 I think you should get out 
 Beat it (beat it) 
 I think you should get out 
 Before I get mad now 
 (Don't even talk to me 'cause) 
 I don't give a fuck what you talkin' bout' 
 I don't really wanna hear that shit coming out ur mouth 
 I'm tryna c them little booty get out my house 
 (Uh huh) girl you act so foolish uh 
 You need to beat it (beat it) 
 What the hell you think you tryna do? 
 Pack the stuff that don't belong to u 
 All those things you need to give it back 
 You don't understand huh before I get mad girl you should 
 Beat it (beat it) 
 I think you should get out 
 Beat it (beat it) 
 I think you should get out 
 Beat it (beat it) 
 I think you should get out 
 Before I get mad now 
 (Don't even talk to me 'cause) 
 I don't give a fuck what you talkin' bout' 
 I don't really wanna hear that shit coming out ur mouth 
 I'm tryna c them little booty get out my house 
 Uh huh) girl you act so foolish uh 
 You need to beat it (beat it) 
 (Chorus: till finish)
