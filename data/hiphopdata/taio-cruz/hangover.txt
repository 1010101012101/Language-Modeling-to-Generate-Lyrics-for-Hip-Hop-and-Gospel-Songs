 I got a hangover, wo-oh! 
 I've been drinking too much for sure 
 I got a hangover, wo-oh! 
 I got an empty cup 
 Pour me some more 
 So I can go until I blow up, eh 
 And I can drink until I throw up, eh 
 And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh 
 I want to keep it going, keep keep keep it going, going, going, going... 
 I got a little bit trashed last night, night 
 I got a little bit wasted, yeah yeah 
 I got a little bit mashed last night, night 
 I got a little shhh faced it, yeah yeah, well... 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 I'm on the roof 
 If you don't know 
 Well now you know 
 I got a hangover, wo-oh! 
 I've been drinking too much for sure 
 I got a hangover, wo-oh! 
 I got an empty cup 
 Pour me some more 
 So I can go until I blow up, eh 
 And I can drink until I throw up, eh 
 And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh 
 I want to keep it going, keep keep keep it going, come on! 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh

 Drink up, 'cause a party ain't a party till you ride all through it 
 End up on the floor, I can't remember, you clueless 
 Officer, like what the hell is you doin' 
 Stopping it, trouble it, you know, you know what? Come again! 
 Gimme Henn, gimme gin, gimme liquor, gimme champagne bubbles til I'm in 
 What happens after that, if you inspired it till I'm ten 
 Like oh my homie Taio, we can all sip again 
 Again and again 
 <???> wasted, so what? Irrelevant! 
 We're kicked to the head, who's selling it 
 I got the hangover, that's my medicine 
 Don't mean like I said, I'm too intelligent 
 A little jack can't hurt this veteran 
 I show up but I never throw up, so let the drinks go up, pour up 
 (Taio Cruz) 
 I got a hangover, wo-oh! 
 I've been drinking too much for sure 
 I got a hangover, wo-oh! 
 I got an empty cup 
 Pour me some more 
 So I can go until they close up, eh 
 And I can drink until I'm told up, eh 
 And I don't ever ever want to grow up, eh 
 I want to keep it going, keep keep it going, come on!
