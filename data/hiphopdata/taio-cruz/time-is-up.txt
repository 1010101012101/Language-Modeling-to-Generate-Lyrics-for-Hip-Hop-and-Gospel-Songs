We're both guna cry tonight 
 We don't wana fight 
 We have never been that way 
 Its obvious we're losing this race 
 Its written on your face 
 So I guess I'll have to say 
 I'm not trying to leave you in the cold, but it's over, it's over 
 And I'm not trying to tell you what you know, It's over 
 The hour glass is empty, and the time is up, and the time is up 
 The hour glass is empty, and the time is up, the time is up 
 Now all I need is, to walk away, to wake me up, to break away 
 Now all I need is, to walk away, to wake me up, to break away 
 Somethings become between you and me, and its hard to see through the weather in the storm 
 It doesn't help for us to pretend 
 It's going 'n' going 'n' going 'n' going 'n' gone 
 I'm not trying to leave you in the cold, but it's over, it's over 
 And I'm not trying to tell you what you know, It's over 
 The hour glass is empty, and the time is up, and the time is up 
 The hour glass is empty, and the time is up, the time is up 
 Now all I need is, to walk away, to wake me up, to break away 
 Now all I need is, to walk away, to wake me up, to break away 
 It's going 'n' going 'n' going 'n' going 'n' gone (x8) 
 The hour glass is empty, and the time is up, and the time is up 
 The hour glass is empty, and the time is up, the time is up 
 Now all I need is, to walk away, to wake me up, to break away 
 Now all I need is, to walk away, to wake me up, to break away
