I can't wait till you're gone away 
 'Cause then i 
 Can move on 
 I can't wait till you're gone away 
 'Cause then i 
 Can move on 
 Then I can say I'm finally over you 
 I'm, I'm finally over you (x3) 
 I can't wait till you're gone away 
 'Cause then i 
 Can move on 
 Can't wait till you are gone (x2) 
 You say that you are no longer in love with me 
 And uh 
 You can't be 
 The one for me 
 Told me this love of ours 
 Is taking us down different roads 
 And its caused us to grow 
 Apart and so 
 Don't say to me 
 That you wan't to be 
 Be good friends with me 
 That's just teasing me 
 Girl its best you leave now 
 Say goodbye to me 
 You should know girl 
 That I'... 
 I can't wait till you're gone away 
 'Cause then i 
 Can move on 
 I can't wait till you're gone away 
 'Cause then i 
 Can move on 
 Then I can say I'm finally over you 
 I'm, I'm finally over you (x3) 
 I can't wait till you're gone away 
 'Cause then i 
 Can move on
