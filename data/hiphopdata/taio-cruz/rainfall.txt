Rainfall [x4] 
 I like to know what's going on, 
 In this world we're living on 
 So much poverty all around me, 
 This is sanity that surrounds me 
 Distant worlds seem so far away 
 People's lives changin everyday, 
 You know 
 I can hear the rainfall (rainfall) 
 I can hear the rainfall (rainfall) 
 Ooh (rainfall) I can hear the rainfall (rainfall) 
 (Rainfall) I can hear the rainfall (rainfall) 
 I like to know when, You and I, 
 Will stop walking and Passing by, 
 So much ignorance then my eyes see 
 My Experience cannot blind me 
 Distance Worlds seem so far from here 
 Seasons change and the rain is near 
 Oh No 
 I can hear the rainfall (Rainfall) 
 Ooh I can hear the rainfall (Rainfall) 
 (Rainfall) Can you?! 'Cause I can hear the rainfall (rainfall) 
 (Rainfall) Can you?! I can hear the rainfall (rainfall) 
 Ooh Whoa Ooh, Yeeaaa, No... Yeeeaaaaa... Woo 
 I Like to find that new reality, 
 Something more, than this fantasy 
 No More forced dreams, 
 No more mind games 
 I can even see, through this dark plain 
 Distant worlds seem so far away 
 People's lives changin everyday, 
 Ooh 
 I can hear the rainfall (rainfall) 
 I can hear the rainfall (rainfall) 
 Yeeeaa (rainfall) I can hear the rainfall 
 (Rainfall) I can hear the rainfall 
 Can You?! Can You?! Can You?! 
 Can You hear the rainfall
