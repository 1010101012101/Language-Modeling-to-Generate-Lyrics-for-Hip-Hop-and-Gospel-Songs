(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh) 
 Sometimes when we fight, I think maybe I 
 Should just let you leave and push you out of my life 
 But I don't decide, 'cause I know that I 
 Just can't survive without you 
 And I know inside I never let you go 'cause I'm sure your the one 
 Even through the rain it's clear, your the one I want 
 And no matter how we fuss and fight girl, you should always know 
 I just can't stop loving you 
 That's why I can't say go (that's why I can't say go) 
 Why I can't say go (that's why I can't say go) 
 Why I can't say go (that's why I can't say go) 
 Why I can't say go (that's why I can't say go) 
 That's why I can't say go 
 (Uh oh, uh oh) 
 I said that's why I can't say go 
 (Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh) 
 Baby I've tried, to tell you goodbye 
 One look from your eyes and those dum toughts say goodbye 
 It's foolish to try, when I know that I 
 I just can't survive without you 
 And I know inside I never let you go 'cause I'm sure your the one 
 Even through the rain it's clear that your the one I want 
 And no matter how we fuss and fight, girl you should always know 
 I just can't stop loving you 
 That's why I can't say go (that's why I can't say go) 
 Why I can't say go (that's why I can't say go) 
 Why I can't say go (that's why I can't say go) 
 Why I can't say go (that's why I can't say go) 
 That's why I can't say go (UH OH) 
 To see through the night, you are my light 
 So even when we fight I know it's going to be all right 
 You have my soul, I'm just letting you know 
 That's why I can't say go (that's why I can't say go) 
 Why I can't say go (that's why I can't say go) 
 Why I can't say go (that's why I can't say go) 
 Why I can't say go (that's why I can't say go) 
 That's why I can't say go 
 I said that's why I can't say go
