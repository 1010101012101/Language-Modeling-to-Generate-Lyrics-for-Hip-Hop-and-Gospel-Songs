What you gon do with all that meat, 
 All that meat down to your feet, 
 I'ma fuck you and skeet skeet skeet, 
 Skeet skeet skeet, skeet skeet skeet, 
 What you gon do with all that cash, 
 All that grass, all that hash, 
 I'ma keep it all and pimp yo ass, 
 Pimp yo ass, pimp yo ass 
 I pimp these bitches yearly, 
 Until they see clearly, 
 They better have my money or they better not come near me, 
 Marijuana, jewelry, looks so fuckin' cool on me, 
 I pull out my chunk and then I let these bitches drool on me, 
 They always be askin'nin if I can hit the ass again, 
 I guess I have to pass again until she bring my cash again, 
 Still I keep on takin' even though I'm taken, 
 We can keep on datin if you buy me some day inns 
 My chunk, my chunk my chunk my chunk, 
 My chunk my chunk my chunk, 
 My chipper collecting chunk 
 She's got me pimpin', 
 Give me all your money honey, 
 Every dime, 
 She's got me pimpin', 
 I'ma pimp yo ass until the, end of time

 They say I'm very handsome, 
 Afroman come dance some, 
 But I can't dance until you put, 
 Money in my hand some, 
 I don't go nuts over sluts, nasty butts, 
 Give the money here before you get severe cuts from my, 
 Baby mama, from my baby mama 
 Baby mama, from my baby mama 
 Stay out my face woman,

 Have me on park avenue, 
 Right next door to mister drummen
