I don't wanna sell yay 
 Get my door kicked in by the kkk 
 Shoulda said the police 
 Lookin' for the quarter piece inside my caprice 
 From the tracks of the ghetto 
 I try to escape 
 Ya caught my music 
 On a CD or rap tape 
 I make it then take it 
 To the mom and papa store 
 For a proper cash flo' 
 From the mom and papa store 
 Don't want no more rappers on consignment 
 Find another alignment 
 Come back another climate 
 People don't even know who you is 
 You need a name in the music biz 
 Your album, for one, has no promotion 
 Your elbows and kneecaps have no lotion 
 Your ashy, your music is trashy 
 Outkast, inside they class me 
 Out the door is where they catch me 
 (Where?) 
 Straight into the street 
 (Where you goin'?) 
 Now I'm on my way to swap meet 
 (Say what?) 
 Tryn to make a mil without a record deal 
 Selling tapes off the back of my Coupe de ville (Bucka!) 
 Hustlin on the street is hard 
 In a fight with the white security guard 
 Talkin' bout 'no solicitin, no publicitin' 
 I try to talk to him but nope he not listenin 
 Punk ass, flunk ass, can't slam dunk ass 
 Skunk ass, monk ass, sufferin suckatash! 
 Now I'm seein a black guard workin for a Korean 
 Tellin' me I can't be in the places that I be in 
 You can spend your money here 
 You can't make no money here 
 You better get outta here ya here here 
 Did I make myself clear? 
 I go and drink a beer 
 Till I'm pissy in my belly 
 Big as missy elliot (EE!) 
 I'm so depressed plus overstressed 
 Wanna rap so hard I'm obsessed 
 Sometimes I wanna cock my heat 
 Make them punks play my song on the beat (BUCKA!) 
 Let me out, let me out 
 Let me show the whole world what I'm all about 
 Let me out, let me out 
 Let me rap till the party people scream 'n' shout 
 Let me out, let me out 
 Let me show the whole world the best of me 
 Let me out, let me out 
 Let me take contol of my destiny 
 Depressed, determined 
 Smokin', shermann 
 Black, German 
 Monster, herman 
 Sellin, crack 
 Money, stacked 
 Down for a murder, black 
 Like roberta flack 
 Get dressed up, get my tapes pressed up 
 'Cause the music industry is messed up, baby! 
 I throw a pity party as I sip bacardi 
 Sell on! rap tapes, I don't need nobody 
 Ima beethoven givin', colt 45 sippin 
 It's the year 2000 and my gerri curl still drippin 
 It might sound strange in my rhyme 
 But I'm from the west coast 
 I can't change with the hands of time 
 What I am is what I am 
 If you don't like what I am I don't give a damn 
 Black pecker's my title, john king is my idol 
 I'm havin' thoughts that's suicidal, young rival 
 I don't care about fashion, just cadillac mashin 
 Bags to put my grass in, bank to put my cash in 
 I don't wear FUBU like you do 'cause FUBU is booboo 
 I pull my gat and make you shit boo boo sit 
 You talk too much shit, that's why you got hit 
 Walkin' home with your gums split 
 While I sit, sell yay, eryday (BUCKA!) 
 Bumpin N.W.A. (BUCK-BUCKA-BUCKA!) 
 Cruisin down the street in my 6 A---FRO 
 Punk niggas get GA-FFO, bitch 
 I wanna kill every cop I meet 
 I wanna burn down this house that swapped me 
 I'm talkin' smack but you ain't hearin 
 Get your gat, I gotta start racketeerin, plus clearin 
 All the koreans and all the europeans 
 The ones makin' money off of black human beings 
 OH! give it up, give it up 
 Its time for the black folks to live it up 
 A-ya-hey! burn it down, burn it down 
 Run the white cops outta town, motherfucker 
 So tell andy griffith that his punk ass b 
 Runs from the black vigilante 
 It can't be, 
 A dictatorship, ran by the klu klux klan 
 Feel the wrath of the afroman 
 Let me out, let me out 
 Let me show these motherfuckers what I'm all about 
 Let me out, let me out 
 Fuck the sheriff in the ass till he scream and shout 
 Let me out, let me out 
 Let me show the whole world the best of me 
 Let me out, let me out 
 Let me take control of my destiny 
 I can do it, I can make it 
 If you don't give it to me baby, ima take it 
 Fuck the music industry, fuck the music biz 
 I make my own rap tape and tell it like it is 
 Revolution, revolution 
 Revolution - that's the solution 
 I made the rap tape, I made the CD 
 Fuck the corporate world, GIVE THE MONEY TO ME! 
 Bitch! 
 Ladadadadadadadadada 
 Nobody understand the Afroman 
 Ladadadadadadadadada 
 Fuck the police and the ku klux klan 
 Ladadadadadadadadada 
 Ima hungry hustla, east side young busta
