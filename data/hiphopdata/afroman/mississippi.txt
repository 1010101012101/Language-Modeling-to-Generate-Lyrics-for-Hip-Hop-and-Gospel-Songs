Please take me back home To Mississippi 
 Please take me back home To Mississippi 
 Before South Central, Palmdale flossin 
 I stayed in a place called Palmer's Crossing 
 Hattiesburg, Mississippi 
 Smokin' marijuana like a Woodstock hippy 
 All my homies in Laurel 
 Beg borrow 
 Buy my rap tape tomorrow 
 Tell DJ Pumpkin Keep it crunck an' Clyde 
 Request my tape when you go inside 
 So I can take Jane and girl 
 To Waynesboro 
 Fuck her homegirl thorough 
 Make her toes curl 
 Rock her world 
 Leave with their Auntie Sheryl 
 She sucks me sucks me 
 Fucks me fucks me 
 Cries every time I leave Biloxi 
 But I hops in the Coup 
 I gots to go 
 Scoop another ho 
 From Tupelo 
 Hit it once hit it twice, then I hit it again 
 Hit it in Meridian 
 Make that bitch rub her clit again 
 Pinch the nipples on her tit again 
 Suck my dick until she spit again 
 Please take me back home To Mississippi 
 Crooked letter crooked letter hump-back hump-back 
 Afroman's the bomb, bump that 
 Please take me back home To Mississippi 
 From the delta to the coast 
 I'm doin' the most 
 Grab your 40 ounce, let's toast. 
 I sold rock cocaine down in Ellisville 
 Baseheads hit the pipe, they can tell it's real 
 Kept my dope stashed with this hoochie 
 Way down yonder in Eastabuchie 
 Cops be sweatin outta town dog 
 Sniffin my car with a hound dog 
 Separate me from my bitch and shit 
 Tryin' to get my bitch to lie, snitch and shit 
 Officer Roscoe P. Coltrane 
 Runnin' warrant checks on the Afroman 
 But I can't be no hip hop star 
 Cuffed in the back of some police car 
 Did you find the gun? NO! 
 Did you find the dope? NO! 
 Open up the back door "Well son, you're free to go" 
 A-F-R-O marijuana cargo 
 Flossed like a cholow 
 In a clean low glow 
 Let's all get drunk tonight 
 I hope I don't fight with a punk tonight 
 Get nervous 
 As I swerve this 
 Cadillac through Purvis 
 Hope I don't crash when I hit Pedal 
 Get my ass kicked in the white ghetto 
 Prejudice police won't let me go 
 Let the tint window camouflage my 'fro 
 I was dumb, now I'm dumber y'all 
 Last summer y'all 
 I fucked all the little girls down in Sumrall 
 Got a phone call from Nikki and June 
 Pickin' some shrooms down in Picayune, baby 
 Just like a shovel I'm truly diggin 
 All these pretty women that I meet in Wiggins 
 On the boat 
 Gulfport 
 I got my dick down some girl's throat 
 I can't help it It's a trip baby 
 I think you need to wipe your lip baby 
 Hula Hula Hula 
 The whole house ruler 
 What's up with all the bitches down in Pascagoula 
 Small towns, small cities 
 But they still got big ol' asses plus titties 
 Is it a bird? Is it a plane? 
 It's the hungry hustler Afroman 
 Flyin through the air in my underwear 
 Geri curl activator in my hair 
 I'm in control like Janet when I hit Jackson 
 Always gettin' plenty panty action 
 McClaine, even McComb 
 Tell the whole world Mississippi's your home 
 Yazoo, Columbia and Natchez 
 I got the weed brother, who got the matches? 
 Who got the funky DJ that scratches? 
 Depend on me like my name was patches 
 First it was a black thing, just the big Willies 
 Now I roll Phillies 
 With all the Hillbillies 
 Never ever thought I'd see the Klu Klux Klan 
 Buying front row seats for the Afroman 
 Confederate flags tobacco in their mouth 
 It's a beautiful thing jumpin' off in the South 
 Afroman, I'm a part of it 
 Hattiesburg hip hop I'm the start of it 
 I'm the latest 
 I'm the greatest 
 And all you haters, I'll mash you like potatoes 
 I'll make your girlfriend holler and scream 
 Then cook me some cornbread and collard greens 
 1982, '83, '84 
 Erin, Broste, Carlos, and Tonto 
 Tryin' to break dance in my B-Boy stance 
 Micheal Jackson glove, parachute pants 
 Calvin Gary, Garnett Jones 
 G-dog 'cause, I don't believe we grown 
 But hey G-dog, you and me'll see dog 
 Whatever happens 'cause, it's you and me dog 
 Or should I say loc 
 Cause you my folk 
 So let's take a toke 
 Till we croak 
 I'm a locsta locsta 
 Hundred spokesta 
 Drinking everyday like I'm supposed to 
 Bottle after bottle dog in my lip-a 
 Flowing on the mic like the Mississippi river
