The more you drink the better I sound 
 Go to the bar and buy another round I feel wonderful 
 How many people feel wonderful tonight 
 She unfastens her bra strap 
 She slides off her underwear 
 The beautiful moonlite 
 Reflects on her pubic hair 
 I open her legs 
 Then slowly slide my tongue inside 
 And say darlin' 
 You taste wonderful tonight 
 She sucks on my dick head 
 She gradually licks my balls 
 She tickles my asshole 
 Cause this girl can do it all 
 I came so hard 
 I slowly lost my eyesight 
 And I said darlin' 
 You suck wonderful tonight 
 (Phone rings) Hey get the phone man 
 Hello, what? 
 Eric Clapton ain't gonna clear it? 
 Tell 'em sue me this shit is tight
