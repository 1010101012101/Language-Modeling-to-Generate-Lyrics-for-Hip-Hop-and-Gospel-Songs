 I meet different people in the streets 
 I can sing, I can rap, I can do beats 
 Back when I was a K-I-D 
 Rappers where assholes to me 
 I don't wanna be like the bad rapper 
 I wanna be the good rap the love for the hood rap 
 So I listen to the circumstances 
 And if I can I give people chances 
 Nobody gave shit to me but should I be like them 
 You sink I swim 
 No I shouldn't so I should help people out if I could 
 What about people like po bitch 
 Yealous of me and he wanna be rich 
 Don't wanna crawl before he walks 
 Po bitch po bitch 
 Mad 'cause hes broke and I'm rich 
 Po bitch po bitch 
 Cryin on the internet little snitch 
 Po bitch po bitch 
 Mad 'cause hes broke and I'm rich 
 Po bitch po bitch

 I don't wanna come off like a jerk 
 But everybody in the world has to work 
 Everyday I spend money, lend money without brining in money, it's not funny 
 Gotta make a profit I can't be broke like po bitch is with no crack to smoke 
 I make money off everything like a flat broke crack smoke human being 
 Named po bitch, internet snitch, dissing me making me rich 
 Drunk 'n' high, afro 420, po lil bitch gets no money 
 But you can get the fuck out my face and cry to the world on myspace 
 A snitch is something I must destroy, never sell crack with po bitch 
 Po bitch po bitch 
 Mad 'cause hes broke and I'm rich 
 Po bitch po bitch 
 Cryin on the internet little snitch 
 Po bitch po bitch 
 Mad 'cause hes broke and I'm rich 
 Po bitch po bitch

 We live around the corner why you on the internet 
 You say you gonna sue me but the letter hasn't came yet 
 I gave you a place to stay, you stole my equipment, bought some J 
 You can loose some real-estate but gain possession 
 You won't teach me a painful lesson I'm teach you one 
 Back up you done, stay on the run with your crack baby son 
 Barny, cookie monster with lerengitis your flat ass bitch got aids and hepatitis 
 I love big women, yeah that's true, that's why I fucked you 
 Bent you over, stuck my dick in, you'll be ready for the pen 
 Snitch in there like you do out here, you won't be around next year 
 Po bitch po bitch 
 Mad 'cause hes broke and I'm rich 
 Po bitch po bitch 
 Cryin on the internet little snitch 
 Po bitch po bitch 
 Mad 'cause hes broke and I'm rich 
 Po bitch po bitch

 You made a song calling me a bitch nigger 
 But I'm a pimp and your beats made me rich nigger 
 I made fat dough out of fresh dough, paid you good you big fat crack hoe 
 Asshole, you a sad soul, sore loser, out in the cold 
 You say I'm washed up but you never washed in 
 I bet you wash everybody's drawers in the pen 
 Come to my house and pull the trigger get off the internet snitch ass nigger 
 Fuck all this drama you got your ass kicked by your baby momma 
 So pack your pistols and your rifles, watch them black gangster cisciples 
 Barking like big dog internet poodles, I'm eating steak while you fools eat noodles 
 Po bitch po bitch 
 Mad 'cause hes broke and I'm rich 
 Po bitch po bitch 
 Cryin on the internet little snitch 
 Po bitch po bitch

 Ey huss up it's the hungry hustla the American dream to successful failure 
 The accepted reject Afro-motherfucking-m-a-n from pimpdale Pimpafornia you know what I'm saying 
 You know bitches get in line but they get checked you know what I'm saying 
 You know Grass grow gotta cut you know what I'm saying 
 And pretty soon you gotta cut it again you know 
 Its just like inhale exhale eastside palmdale
