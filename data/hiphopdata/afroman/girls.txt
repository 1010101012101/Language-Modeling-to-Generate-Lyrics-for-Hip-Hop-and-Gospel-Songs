 We took a ride to my hood 
 And I rode her real good 
 Like Martin Luther King

 Make Red Riding Hood

 They gotta be 
 The most precious commodity 
 My brain's like the ocean 
 But nothing is swimming 
 Through my head 
 Except naked women

 Love these nuts

 This song 
 We used to sing 
 When we was little kids 
 Right) 
 My girl got two big lips 
 Taste like potato chips 
 My girl got two big boobs 
 Just like two intertubes 
 My girl got two big hips 
 Just like two battleships 
 My girl got real long hair 
 Down to her underwear 
 My girl gotta slender waste 
 Her favourite seat is on my face 
 I got taste 
 I got taste
