Smoke a blunt 
 I love to smoke a blunt man 
 Hey man you know, my white homies ask me 
 Do you like uh, bongs or blunts? 
 I tell 'em blunts, 'cause I get pulled over all the time 
 I can't be throwin' bongs out the window, you know what I mean 
 Smoke a blunt 
 Nice and slow 
 Hold the smoke 
 Then let it go 
 Smoke a blunt 
 Nice and slow 
 Hold the smoke 
 Then let it go 
 I love smoking weed all by myself 
 Don't have to pass it to no one else 
 I hit my blunt 
 Anytime I want 
 Got so much weed I don't have to hunt 
 I don't get hyper 
 I don't get crunk 
 I do get high 
 I do get drunk 
 Once I'm high and I'm high no doubt 
 I grab my ashtray and put my cigar out 
 Once my high is gone with the wind 
 I grab my lighter then I flick then I again 
 Briefly take a chronic break 
 Weed headache 
 Big mistake 
 I'm high so I put my blunt down 
 Turn up my music and dance all around 
 I can't hear the phone 
 I can't hear the door 
 I never leave home 'less 
 Its time to school 
 Smoke a blunt 
 Nice and slow 
 Hold the smoke 
 Now let it go 
 Smoke a blunt 
 Nice and slow 
 Hold the smoke 
 Now let it go 
 I remember when I started smokin' weed 
 Pickin' out the stems and the seeds 
 I didn't have enough to buy me a beer 
 My homeboy told me to hit this here (?) 
 I grabbed the blunt 
 I took a hit 
 I thought to myself 
 "I like this shit" 
 It's better than beer 
 So annalyze this 
 I don't have to go take a piss 
 I don't know how to roll 
 But the people I roll with 
 Know how to roll blunts like a pole 
 Smoke a blunt 
 Nice and slow 
 Hold the smoke 
 Now let it go 
 Smoke a blunt 
 Nice and slow 
 Hold the smoke 
 Now let it go 
 Smoke a blunt 
 Nice and slow 
 Hold a smoke, uh 
 Now let it goo 
 Hahahah uh haha uh 
 Drivin' cross country though minnesota 
 State fuckin' trooper straight pulled me over 
 He said I was drivin' fast as hell 
 He took a deep breath and asked "what's that smell?" 
 I knew I was busted, at this point 
 So I handed him a beautiful, perfectly rolled joint 
 He looked at it once, 
 He looked at it twice, 
 He told me, "you roll your joints real nice" 
 Afroman don't give a fuck 
 Light that blunt and get stupid stuff 
 Smokin' to me is so much fun 
 People bitch 'cause I don't get nothin' done 
 If you are a little kid 
 Please don't do the things I did 
 Anti-drug message? let me see... 
 Don't smoke weed 
 Give it to me!
