LATE AT NIGHT by AFROMAN (BACAAAAAA) 
 Check out this beat mayn 
 (Talkin') 
 Late at niiiight I wonder and I roam 
 I feel so goood I don't wanna go home 
 ?(Clap)? and snaps (?(clap)? and snaps) 
 Taking laps around the hood 
 Play my musiiic 
 'Cause it makes me feel real good 
 (Talking) 
 (Vocalizing) 
 '83 coup guess who in it? 
 Gettin' searched by da cops ev'ry 35 minutes 
 Hope I get sum pussy while I'm drunk and high 
 Befo I fuck around 'n' catch a DUI 
 Hungry Hustla Hattiesburgundy 
 Drink till my eyes turn burgundy 
 The ?(butt)? hit the beer n I started to buzz 
 In da middle of da street danm 'cause (danm 'cause) 
 Crazii is wat I drive you 
 If you work at da drive through 
 'Cause we been smokin' weed in da country 
 Babii we got da munchies 
 But now days I'm polite 'n' not rude 
 'Cause I don want babii grl to spit in my food 
 How y'all doin'?... All right... thank you very much ... uh good night 
 Row up da INdo 
 Row down da window 
 Let da wind hit my face 
 While I hit da weed... bump da bass 
 Swerve to da spot where my homeboiz meet 
 Messin up traffic in da middle of da street 
 The rest kickin back in da sidewalk 
 I floss my ride 'n' glide like a hawk 
 I drive real fast then I STOOOOP 
 Park against da curb hit da switch 'n' DROOOOP 
 I put ?(southern compton)? in my CUUUP 
 Hop in my cadilac 'n' pop back UUUp 
 Roll out bumpin wut I just made 
 Still on a mission thryna get laid 
 The more you drink da better I sound 
 Go to da bar buy another round 
 (CHOURUS) Till end
