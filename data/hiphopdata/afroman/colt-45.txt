(Afroman) 
 Hey, play that beat over, man 
 Right on 
 Make me feel all right 
 My name is, Jeffrey 
 Colt 45, baby 
 Colt 45, baby, hey 
 I love you baby 
 It's 'fro 20 and I got to drive 
 Through my neighborhood for some Colt 45 
 Huddle up, hustle up, liquor store breathin' 
 Move quickly, everybody beefin' 
 Colt 45, two Zig Zags 
 Two car loads, expiring tags 
 Liquor store empty, get away parkin' 
 Just in case bullets start barkin' (bhoa!) 
 Flirt with the fine hoes 
 Crack jokes with the winos 
 I know where Colt 45 is at 
 In and out like that 20 seconds flat 
 Money on the counter, by Miss Wong 
 I can get shot if I take too long 
 Right around the corner through the park 
 Before the sheriff swim up like a shark (wheoaaaau!) 
 Close the gate, hop out the car 
 Start back selling my caviar 
 Wassup, my plastic cup, my stereo all right 
 Colt 45, baby 
 Colt 45 (after dark, smoke that tumbleweed) 
 Colt 45 
 Colt 45 (oh, baby) 
 Rough expression on my face 
 Why do I like that nasty taste? 
 Maybe it's because I like the buzz 
 Don't care who you is or who you was 
 I cruise the avenue 
 When smokin' weed and havin' brew 
 Let all four my windows down 
 Pound the ground with my OG sound 
 Got warrants, it ain't fun 
 Getting handcuffed on a liquor store run 
 Pretty women everywhere 
 Brother can't help but stop and stare 
 Eyes, lips, teeth, hair 
 Breasts, thighs, derrière 
 If she do or don't reply 
 I still feel good that she walked by 
 Colt 45 
 Colt 45, yeah 
 Colt 45 (I love you, baby) 
 Colt 45 (oh, baby) 
 Colt 45 (works every time) 
 Colt 45 
 Remember that night 
 I've seen you, dawg 
 Drunk as hell 
 Ain't seen your 'fro 
 Hug my neck 
 Shake my hand 
 Smoke that blunt with Afroman 
 Hit that bong 
 Play my song 
 Put it on repeat all night long 
 Platinum overseas 
 Gold in the states 
 I got a new album with LA tour dates 
 Got my own label 
 Mister Mixx on the turntable 
 Daryl Havard, Octopus Prime 
 Play two different instruments at the same time 
 Jody Lone 
 That's my drummer 
 Sure, we'll be on tour this summer 
 Talkin' jive 
 Playin' live

 Colt 45, baby 
 Colt 45 (I love you, honey) 
 Colt 45 (Colt 45) 
 Colt 45, yeah 
 Colt 45 (Colt 45) 
 Colt 45 (after dark, smoke that tumbleweed) 
 Colt 45, baby 
 Colt 45 (I love you, honey) 
 Billy D. Williams is old 
 I got a new Billy D. Williams 
 You know what they call him? (What they call him man?) 
 They call him 
 Afroman [repeat] 
 (Verse 5; the word "Afroman" repeats throughout this verse) 
 (Say what?) 
 (Turn it up) 
 (Right on, come on) 
 Walk with a limp (one time) 
 Get searched by the police, Colt 45 
 Buzzin' like a bumblebee 
 Don't want nobody to worry me 
 (Gettin' on my nerves) 
 I wanna get tipsy 
 Travel like a gypsy [x2] 
 Now cars and houses I may not own 
 But I'm a bad motherfucker on the microphone 
 I drink it all day 
 I drink it all night 
 Don't worry 'bout me baby 
 I'ma be all right 
 (Outro; the word "Afroman" repeats to end) 
 Buzzin' 
 Buzzin' like a bumblebee 
 Don't want nobody to worry me 
 (Gettin' on my nerves) 
 Tipsy 
 Travel like a gipsy [x2]
