Over the moon is wher I'll be fillin my cup, 
 From a pot of tea 
 And in the end my life will send for you to be with me 
 In the night I will pray god I wish my love would stay 
 For me... for him.now theirs no direction in the wind. 
 I'm staring at the moon playing with the spoon that sits on the table 
 My tea is getting cold while I am getting old 
 I pray for the moon light to send me well wishes 
 Coming from over the hill and bring me my true love 
 For ther I cannot be without him 
 I hope we will be together 
 Through history and beyond 
 Not even this pillow thet lays upon my bed will make me happy 
 If it's not you then I shall not be happy 
 I don't feel my peace nor the content 
 I think my love for you has been bent it's not what has been sent to me 
 Now I shall leave this little world and be... 
 Disolved into history...
