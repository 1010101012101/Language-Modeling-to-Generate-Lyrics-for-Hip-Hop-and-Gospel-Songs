This next song is dedicated to all whack rappers 
 And all the whack people who like and buy their whack music 
 I think you crazy if you like Jay-z 
 Don't change clothes change the CD 
 Murphy Lee what the hook gonna be 
 Cause you do need a hook and another beat 
 Jermaine Dupree, you know you wrong 
 Fucked up Chingy's song 
 Afro-mother fuckin-M-A-N can't stand no mother fuckin' Ying-Yang Twins 
 I think Lil John and the Eastside Boys is an ignorant, irritating bunch of noise 
 If you don't give a damn gon throw it out 
 If you don't give a damn gon throw it out 
 To the window, up against the wall 
 Laugh when the motherfucker falls 
 These fools can't rap at all 
 I never buy a tune 
 From the Neptunes 
 When they beat come on 
 I hope it go off soon 
 Fabolous, what's Fabolous about? 
 I think he terrible, music unbearable 
 Rippin off Mase with that look on his face (oh man) 
 I rest my case 
 Kelis, wow, I hate her so much right now 
 My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard 
 Who gave her a record deal, oh my god! 
 Nas is in the video with Kelis 
 Jay-z's in the video with Beyonce 
 Both of these rappers are whack 
 Yet people talk smack about 40 Delefante 
 The music industry is usin' the slang 
 And trying to play it off like they doing their thing 
 C'mon Cameron, oh boy (oh boy), Dipset (Dipset), oh boy 
 How can you be from a city so black 
 And bust shitty lyrics that's whick whick whack (get back on Kelis) 
 Oh yeah Kaelis, this is what I want you to do 
 Get on your knees, face me, 
 I got a milkshake for you and its tasty 
 Just like your album 
 Puff Daddy, enough already 
 Now its P. Diddy still sound shitty 
 How can your group be called Da Band 
 No body plays an instrument man 
 I don't play B2K 
 R&B singers B2Gay (you know they broke up over money) 
 Oh yeah, that's too bad, I don't care 
 I think its good, no doubt 
 They can stop putting all that bullshit out 
 Like "what a girl want what a girl need 
 A fuckin' job and a brand new hair weave 
 What a girl want what a girl need 
 A fuckin' job and a brand new hair weave" 
 A bump bump bump 
 That is all I wanna do 
 A bump bump bump 
 That's my song that's what I wrote down on the piece of paper 
 A bump bump bump 
 Call up Puff Daddy ask him if he wants to do a verse with me 
 Real pimps get down on the flow 
 But I don't see a hoe in the video 
 Why is David Banner runnin' from the clan 
 What happened to the bitches man 
 Cadillac on 22's why is David Banner takin' off his shoes 
 Its supposed to be about Cadillacs 
 Not David Banner bringin' dead people back 
 Even though it's all good 
 It might get misunderstood 
 Damn skippy, Mississippi is the hood 
 Raps I'm writing up, I can't lighten up 
 Until these whack ass rappers tightin up 
 Missy Elliot, she looks like Halle Berry, that's scary 
 Her CD ain't worth it 
 Put you money in your pocket and reverse it 
 Her CD ain't worth it 
 Put you money in your pocket and reverse it 
 Missy Elliot makes a bunch of bullshit 
 Missy Elliot makes a bunch of bullshit 
 Missy Elliot makes a bunch of bullshit 
 Missy Elliot makes a bunch of bullshit 
 Missy Elliot makes a bunch of bullshit 
 I can't stand her music going in my ear 
 If you like Missy Elliot get the fuck out of here 
 I can't stand her music going in my ear 
 If you like Missy Elliot get the fuck out of here 
 Most rappers are whack just like the people they attract 
 Most rappers are whack just like the people they attract 
 Most rappers are whack just like the people they attract 
 Most rappers are whack just like the people they attract 
 Hey man, hey, look Trina's on TV 
 Oh yeah, ooh she fine 
 Hey homie, Trinas on TV, she cute 
 Not when she rappin', press mute 
 And now we gonna play a single from the album weaveolution 
 Even with her weave (even with a weave), I can't stand Eve (I can't stand Eve) 
 Even with her weave (even with a weave), I can't stand Eve (I cantstandEve), harmonize 
 Even with her weave, I can't stand Eve 
 Even with her weave, I can't stand Eve 
 I can't stand Eve 
 That's what I said 
 She got a pin head 
 Most peoples head is round 
 Hers go up and down, like a peanut 
 She could be pretty 
 If her attitude wasn't so shitty 
 Talkin' bout "you tryin' to come through the back door" 
 She ain't got no back door 
 What she talkin' smack fo' 
 Male bashin with Mary J 
 Like queen latifa she must be gay 
 In my radio you gets no play not today 
 What the fuck happened to MTV 
 Why these whack people get to make a CD 
 I don't know man look at 50 Cent 
 He don't move his mouth when he rap man 
 He be rappin' like Mike Tyson or somethin' you know what I'm sayin' 
 He don't move his mouth 
 (Mumbling) 
 Open your mouth 
 (More mumbling) 
 Ill teach you how to stunt 
 Teach me how to stunt? 
 They need to let me teach them how to roll a fat blunt 
 Get high get drunk and take it easy 
 And stop making songs so cheesy 
 Now Manny Fresh is actually fresh 
 And Juvenille, I like his style 
 But the worst rapper I ever heard man 
 Is the whack ass mother fuckin' Birdman 
 What about Silk the Shocker? 
 My name is Silk and ill shock you 
 I've jus been shocked by Silk the Shocker
