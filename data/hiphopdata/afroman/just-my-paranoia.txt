Ya know 
 I dun been to jail for a lot of stupid shit 
 And when you go to jail for a lot of stupid shit, you try not to go back 
 And... ya know I take percausion ya know 
 However, sometimes you can take too much percausion to the point where 
 It gets rediculious... oh man 
 Each day at my dope spot, I watch him as he passes by 
 I say to myself, he looks like the FBI 
 A white man like him, what is he doing over here? 
 I wonder, what does he want 
 Then he asked me "you gotta light, you wanna help me smoke this blunt" 
 It was just my paranoia, hey hey 
 Runnin' away with me yeah 
 It was just my parania 
 Runnin' away 
 Down on my luck couldn't fine no job 
 Id rather sell dope and rob, why squab? 
 I know I can't do it forever 
 So uh ima do it quick and clever, however 
 Drinkin' malt liquor, smokin' endo 
 Two cops ran pass my window 
 It's a raid, uh that's what I assume 
 I flushed two ounces in the bathroom 
 I ran out the back 
 Before they could find me 
 Come to find out, they raided the house behind me 
 Yeah man they went through my back yard 
 Hopped over the fence... anyway 
 It was just my paranoia, hey hey 
 Runnin' away with me yeah 
 It was just my parania 
 Runnin' away 
 I'm tellin' you man, your paranoia can get to you 
 I remember I use to trip everything, know what ima sayin' 
 I'd be chillin' wit the hom... we'd be goin' off man 
 You know what I hate though 
 I hate them late model cars dawg on it 
 Look like vice wit all those attenas on it 
 Paranoid, I use to sell yayo man 
 Trippin' on the telephone and the mail man 
 Treat customers like compulsive liars 
 Raise they shirt and check for wires 
 I got a little money, but I need a little more 
 Dam, somebody's knockin' at my front door 
 Some guy in a shirt and tie 
 Is it homicide or FBI 
 Does he have a warrant for Joseph Foreman? 
 Oh you're a moreman? 
 It was just my paranoia, hey hey 
 Runnin' away with me yeah 
 It was just my parania 
 Runnin' away 
 Hey man, you know where my paranoia really get me at man? 
 When I'm walkin' through the mall or shoppin' 
 Everybody be lookin' like undercovers 'cause they be starin' 
 And I don't be knowin', ya know what I'm sayin' 
 I hate sellin dope, I think about stoppin' 
 Undercover cops follow me while I'm shoppin' 
 Trackin me, wit a hidden camera 
 Plottin to through me back in the slamma 
 They think I don't see em 
 But yes I do, they some haters 
 Actin' like they pickin' tomatas 
 I'm ready, for a quick decision 
 Keep em, I'm my perifial vision 
 I see 'em in the airport, plain and clear 
 Street clothes with that little wire in they ear 
 They rush me, shake my hand 
 I'm your biggest fan 
 Sign this for me Afroman 
 It was just my paranoia, hey hey 
 Runnin' away with me yeah 
 It was just my parania 
 Runnin' away 
 Ya know, I wrote a hit song 
 "Because I got high" 
 Sign with universal 
 Now my bank accounts drivin' 
 Universal Records year man 
 Took my money like enron 
 Broke and alone, things got hard 
 However, it brought me close to god 
 I changed my life and became a christian 
 Singer, rapper and musician 
 I've been high, I've been low 
 I've been rich, I've been poor 
 I've been right, I've been wrong 
 Since I been wit god, my paranoia's gone 
 (New chorus x2 fades) 
 No more paranoia hey hey 
 Runnin' away wit me yeah 
 I have no more paranoia 
 Runnin' away
