Ah shit, shit, shit... 
 Now I'm walkin' down the street with some chicken and a forty 
 I'm yellin' at these hoochies and I'm lookin' for a party 
 Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo' 
 Run outta doe, slap the hoe 
 Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto' 
 Afroman likes tall cans 
 Afroman likes tall cans 
 Afroman likes tall cans 
 Afroman likes tall cans 
 Now I'ma afroholic, called the Afroman 
 Love to sag my khakis with a tall can 
 My homies pop the forty of some St. I's 
 Now that mother, uh, staggerin' from side to side 
 We the loudest homeboys in my neighborhood 
 We look real bad but we feel so good 
 My thirst is quenched but my cravin' won't extinguish 
 I need some forty ounce mother uh! Old English 
 Put the top in my mouth, put the bottom to the ceilin' 
 Drink it down, down, until I get that crazy feelin' 
 I'm just walkin' down the street with some chicken and a forty 
 I'm yellin' at these hoochies and I'm lookin' for a party 
 Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo' 
 Run outta doe, slap the hoe 
 Get the do' and go back to that liquor sto'

 See these girls be actin' all bad and rude 
 Always gotta bad attitude 
 You see I just wanna dance, why can't you get the picture 
 Act like a brotha wanna move in wit cha 
 I gots no fame and I gots no wealth 
 So I whined up dancin' by my goddamn self 
 But I pay my money, just like you 
 And baby I'ma do what I came to do 
 You see I can't wait around till I get rich 
 Just to make yo gold diggin' attitude switch 
 So I'm walkin' down the street with some chicken and a forty 
 I'm yellin' at these hoochies and I'm lookin' for a party 
 Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo' 
 Run outta doe, slap the hoe

 I stepped into this party full of Mexicans 
 I didn't realize I was the only black man 
 One hand on my bottle, the other on my peter 
 I barked like a dog and started freakin' senoritas 
 I think she was embarrassed with the eight ball in my cup 
 She kept on steppin' back so I kept on steppin' up 
 This vato strolled up, put his gun to my head 
 I knew if I moved I was officially dead 
 That had to be his woman, I know it doggonit 
 Ain't the first time that I got confronted 
 "Got my quete, what up ese? Get the fuck outta here" 
 I said "I'm gone muthafucka just gimme my beer" 
 'Cause I'm just walkin' down the street with some chicken and a forty 
 I'm yellin' at these hoochies and I'm lookin' for a party 
 Drink it fast, make it last, till you know it ain't no mo' 
 Run outta doe, slap the hoe
