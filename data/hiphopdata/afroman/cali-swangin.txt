Afroman - Cali Swangin'

 Baby - make me feel alright 
 Nobody feels - like a "G" feels 
 When he post up his '64 on three wheels 
 Daddy ask me "what you wanna be when you grow up" 
 A low rider with some colt 45 in my cup 
 I was on my way to college and then saw 
 A Cadillac three wheelin' down Crenshaw 
 It was nineteen hundred and eighty three 
 I knew exactly what the Fuck I wanted to be 
 A low rider bass provider drop down like a spider 
 Spy the hood rat and go straight inside her 
 But if she Buttless 
 Bitch can't ride in my Cutlass 
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday 
 Runnin' them Red lights sideways 
 In the parks and streets - brothers keep dying 
 But I drop the back and let the sparks keep flyin' 
 My daddy wanted me to take the Dayton's off the Dodge 
 'Cause the baseheads keep breakin' in the garage 
 I keep saggin' in my 'Lac with my butt out, I strutt out 
 Look at my two front tires - you know I cut out 
 I took from the ghetto what I could take 
 But you can't take my P.O with the metal flake 
 I'm a knucklehead buzzin' off of alcohol 
 Messing up a new car for no reason at all

 Hit the switch Homeboy, Hit the swiotch 
 Stop acting like a little old biotch 
 X2 
 Front and back Homeboy front and back 
 Blaze the sac and pass back my yack 
 X2 
 Three wheels Homeboy, Three Wheels 
 Let me see your low rider "G" skills 
 X2 
 One switch, Two switch, Three switch, Four 
 Oh my God, my batteries low.

 (Piano riffz) 
 Can't stop sportin' them allstars 
 Can't stop driving them gangster cars 
 New cars just don't appeal to me 
 It's 2004 and I'm a still a "G" 
 Cops don't want brothers loiterin' 
 Gangbangers drive by and start Slaughterin' 
 So they talk alot of smack and write a fat ticket 
 But I drive around the corner, come back and still kick it 
 Gotta sell wheatgerm and crack, so 
 I can have money just incase a break a axle 
 I turn my music up loud - to attrack a crowd 
 Throw the hood out the window, make the homeboys proud 
 Keep my kahki's creased right, with my girl in my ride 
 I used to be local but now I'm Worldwide 
 Afromanmusic.com blowin' up like vietnam

 Af-ro-man-make the cadillac coupe pancake 
 Lock it up, Cock it up 
 Post on three's, twist on D's 
 Afro as you're ride her, Cadillac walk like a spider 
 Smash out fast then dump her 
 Sparks straight flying from the bumper 
 World-Wide-Hungry-Hustler 
 Hit that switch don't be no buster 
 Hop in the coupe like a toad frog 
 Go swoop up your role dog

 Go way back like heyday

 Six 'fo
