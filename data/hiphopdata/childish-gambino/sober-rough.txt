And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober 
 I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high 
 And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober 
 I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high 
 But now I'm so high, but now I'm so high 
 But now I'm so high 
 Girl, what's your problem 
 'Cause I know it's hard sometimes, baby just give it some time 
 Oh honey now girl, we can solve them 
 If you just give me some time I can open up your mind 
 If you let it shine, you can free your mind 
 Cause now I know 
 And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober 
 I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high 
 And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober 
 I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high 
 But now I'm so high, but now I'm so high 
 But now I'm so high 
 Girl, if it's done right 
 Well you know it's got to be, something wonderful to me 
 Oh honey know girl, give it one night 
 If you just give it a chance, loving you is not my plan 
 'Cause I know one day you'll see 
 All the things that we can be 
 Oh na no no 
 And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober (I want to be the only one) 
 I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high 
 And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober 
 I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high 
 But now I'm so 
 And now that's it's over, I'll never be sober 
 I couldn't believe, but now I'm so high 
 But now I'm so high, but now I'm so high 
 But now I'm so high, but now I'm so high
