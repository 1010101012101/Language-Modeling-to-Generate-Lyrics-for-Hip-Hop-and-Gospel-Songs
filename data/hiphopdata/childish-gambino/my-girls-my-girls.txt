In the fourth grade I had a crush on Tia Smith 
 Sixth grade and this crush is turned to Beatrice 
 But they don't like me 
 Because I'm too nice 
 And I'm kinda fat 
 And not the dope type 
 But I grew out of that 
 And it's a miracle 
 Not every girl sees me as marrying material 
 It's a buyers market 
 I'm Alicia's target 
 And every other girl who wanna let me steam their carpet 
 I love these hipster girls 
 And they feel the same 
 Now they don't have to choose when someone asks them Drake or Wayne 
 And niggas waiting on me 
 We didn't have a voice 
 We used to have to act street but now you've got a choice 
 My momma's brownie mix 
 I keep the goodies moist 
 Of every girl I'm tappin 
 This wasn't supposed to happen 
 Hard to keep my thoughts straight 
 On every date 
 Especially when my penis talking 
 SWAT team, cover me 
 I'm going in. 
 I do not talk. I am just a rapper. 
 Yes, I got 
 I'm meeting other girls 
 But you don't wanna hear that 
 For fear that I fuck a lot. 
 And you don't wanna get attached 'cause you'll like me 
 I fucked a girl named Keira Knightly 
 Nah, I made it up 
 Cause it sounded dope 
 I don't give a fuck. 
 Ride me, Giddy up. 
 They can hear us in the hall, arsenio. 
 Naw girl I don't wanna shoot a video 
 I do it all day 
 Don't you watch me on the TV show? 
 I'm gonna get mines any means necessary 
 Got red bull pulsing through my pulmonary 
 Least I feel like it 
 Met her at a club 
 Now we're making out 
 And I ain't spend a dub 
 I'm gonna try to live it up like top floor 
 And my girls like get so I bought more 
 All girls 18 and over love this light speed Casanova 
 House pimped out will young sonoma 
 Sleep on me that is a coma 
 Yeah nigga, you see what I'm getting at 
 I'm getting at her 
 I'm hitting that 
 Her kitty cat purred 
 How weird is that? 
 I'm digging that 
 A nigga not 
 Trying to say I don't make mistakes 
 I'm trying to fix all the hearts I break 
 But every time that we talk in my apartment 
 We're gonna kiss a little 
 And then we start shit 
 You're heartless! 
 Don't call again! 
 Don't email! 
 We can't be friends! 
 I swear that this is the end! 
 Then I call her next week 
 And we do it again. 
 My girls, my girls, my girls. my girls. 
 My girls, my girls, my girls, my girls. 
 I don't mean to seem like I care about material things, like a social status. 
 I just want four walls and adobe slabs for my girls. 
 Ow!
