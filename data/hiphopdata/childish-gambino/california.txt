She want to move to California 
 She must've fuckin' lost her mind 
 She want to move to California 
 That's how they get you every time 
 She make a movie with her friends 
 Put it up in a minute 
 Everybody say it now 
 Ain't no loop at the minute 
 Everybody say how, how you do it, you did it? 
 I'ma show you what it done, but enough for a finish 
 Pay attention, you listen, you keep losing your mind 
 How you want to loop this shit but looking like a Vine? 
 But they no pay for no privilege 
 Now she broke in Koreatown in the condo you rented 
 Better get your percentage 
 In California, ooh 
 She must've fuckin' lost her mind, yeah 
 He want to move to California 
 He want to hang with DC Fly 
 All the people on the roam and the follower people 
 I go watching a "ha ha," make a girlfriend giggle 
 Make her feel so official, make it Serena Vista 
 Supernova, new residual, making money a little 
 Make the smoker illegal 
 Make the living illegal 
 Make the laughing illegal 
 Make it snap for a people 
 When you make a movie now, know you making no difference 
 It's a tickle on the mind 'fore me finish your sentence 
 So go pimp a like on Vine but don't pay for the privilege 
 Now you broke in Koreatown in the condo you rented 
 Better get your percentage 
 Oh, you broke in Koreatown in that condo you rented 
 Better get your percentage 
 In California 
 She must've fuckin' lost her mind, yeah 
 He want to move to California 
 He want to hang with DC Fly
