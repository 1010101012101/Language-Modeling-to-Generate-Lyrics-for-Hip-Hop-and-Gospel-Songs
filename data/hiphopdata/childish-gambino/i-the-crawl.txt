Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Rec League, I ain't handball 
 Y'all B-string like a broke guitar 
 And I still put it down like the family dog 
 Yeah, I murder some, I murder one 
 Explain it all, Ferguson 
 We ain't gotta sing the same old love song 
 Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on 
 Yeah what you saying to it? 
 Old money look no money don't do it 
 Nigga coming round in they lane like a Huey 
 And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty 
 (At her booty) So ratchet now 
 They wanna smoke niggas, but they Black & Mild 
 So we opted out 
 Ok cool 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Blue drink by the bouquet 
 Till I'm blue faced on a Tuesday 
 (Can I have some?) 
 #NiggasBeLike 
 Put a plus eighteen on that e-vite 
 And I said what I felt, no re-write 
 Nah nah, they can't hold me 
 June / July, drop something 
 I double dare you, I'm Marc Summers 
 I scortch women, I burn autumns 
 Gut niggas, so Kurt Vonne 
 Elle Varner, I got a crush on her 
 I gotta wait in line for that 
 Ain't nobody got time for that 
 Ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that 
 Too true like 2 Chainz 
 Blue blood like he both gangs. 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone 
 Where we were, kinda thing 
 Betchya cry, all alone
