Rainbows, sunshine everywhere I go 
 Rainbows, sunshine, go 
 Rainbows, sunshine 
 Rainbows, sunshine, yeah 
 Rainbows, sunshine 
 I thought I told you 'bout it 
 (Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know) 
 You don't leave home without it 
 (Move that kilo, move that kilo, move that kilo) 
 She on my back about it 
 (C-3PO, C-3PO, C-3PO) 
 And all the time, ohh 
 (Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know) 
 How could you ever question? They know better to mention 
 The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention 
 The who, what, why, and where, they sport the flyest pairs 
 She got the nicest hair, and she know life is better with this liqour 
 It's crazy how the world look different 
 It's crazy how the girls look different 
 The colors and the sounds so vivid 
 You never catch your boy bo-bimbin' 
 Me sittin' on the sidewalk, now that don't sound right 
 But as long as I look fly by prom night, go 
 Rainbows, sunshine 
 Rainbows, sunshine 
 Rainbows, sunshine 
 Rainbows, sunshine 
 He slangs, his yay, through the corridors 
 Every day, 20 K, yep, at the very least for sure 
 And they say there's no way I should stay with someone like you 
 But I tell them no 
 There's no way I could stray, gotta stay with someone like you 
 'Cause I know one day, you could take me away, far away 
 I know you could pay all the money you made 
 There'll be plenty of sunshine 
 I never worry ‘bout it 
 (Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know) 
 I have my nigga count it 
 (Back up them O's, back up them O's, back up them O's) 
 She’s dressed up in gold, dressed up in gold 
 (C-3PO, C-3PO, C-3PO) 
 I’m out of time 
 (Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)
