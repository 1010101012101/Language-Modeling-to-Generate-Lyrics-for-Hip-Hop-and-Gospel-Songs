I'm So On it, You're So On it (x12) 
 Oh, Oh, Oh. 
 Okay, One for the money, 
 Two for the money, 
 I used to write jokes, 
 Ain't this shit funny? 
 Models on me, yes these girls crazy, 
 Gotta take advantage, 
 That is what the fans made me (?), 
 Shine on these niggas, 
 How these niggas stay Shady? 
 And if you don't see me, 
 You are not star gazing, 
 Play my cards right, 
 I may never meet the dealer (?), 
 And yes I'm in the building like a horror movie killer, 
 I gotta stay sick, 
 I'd be dead if I was iller, 
 Is it weird going hard when these niggas goin' filler? 
 Yep, my life is great, 
 I changed my stars, 
 I re-arrange fate when I rap on bars, 
 Cheezy in the building, 
 Hope you niggas missed me, 
 Chillin' with these bitches, 
 Got my nigga feelin' tipsy, 
 Hate is mean muggin'(?), 
 Face is sour like my whiskey, 
 I don't need a chaser, 
 Tell that liquor come and get me, 
 Who'd of thought this rappin' make sense (cents), no 50? 
 And if you're doin' great like I am, 
 Say it with me. 
 I'm So On it, You're So On it (x12) 
 Oh, Oh, Oh. 
 Yeah, I used to be broke, 
 No Cash, 
 And them niggas played games, 
 Road Rash, 
 Walkin' 'round NYU 
 Lookin' for a dollar, 
 Too proud to ask my friends 
 Or my strugglin' father, 
 So I skate around the city for a couple hours, 
 Dreamin' up a day that I could say this world is ours, 
 Now I got some, 
 But I want it all, 
 And I won't stop until Rhianna gives my ass a call, 
 And I know that I'm addicted to this alcohol, 
 Cause this shit hurts, 
 Call it the uncle curse, 
 But I'm livin' for the moment, 
 Not the long haul, 
 And I refuse to slow down until its last call, 
 Erica Keeps telling me to grow a conscience (?), 
 And treat women like money, no object, 
 But these hoes are a much different story, 
 Straight laced chicks, 
 Don't do nothin' for me, 
 I'm in a weird place, 
 I got a little money, 
 But money won't buy you time, 
 If all the time is runnin' from me, 
 There's so much I wanna do, 
 Like write a script or write a book, 
 Get an hour on HBO, and date a girl that likes to cook, 
 And stop havin' all of these crushes, 
 On all of my friends girlfriends, 
 I think I'm jealous they got someone when the world ends, 
 It looks nice, I gotta get me one of those, 
 I haven't found Mrs. Right, 
 But I'm On it though, 
 Yeah I'm on it though. 
 I'm So On it, You're So On it, Yes I'm On It. (x8)
