(Hook: MC Chris) 
 I am the awesome 
 You see me flossin', watch me walk upon your face 
 Make that incision 
 I leave you itchin' just to join my monster race 
 Say I'm just messin' 
 Yeah well I'm pissed and I can keep an even key 
 You think you know me 
 But you can blow me cause you don't know how I feel 
 (Verse 1: Childish Gambino) 
 It's Childish Gambino, ho 
 What you know about that? 
 Niggas 'fraid to go outside, they some house cats 
 'Cause if they see me, they might have to act right 
 I'm livin' life right, like I got a past life 
 Boy I got a flashlight 
 Check my fuckin' hoodie skin 
 Like God was makin' light and threw my hoodie in 
 Bambi, naw nigga that's my pseudonym 
 Call me Elroy 
 Nigga we some hooligans 
 And just in case, I keep a million in the glove box 
 Blast this shit from in your car to make the hood rock 
 Ice cold, bright colors, like a juice pop 
 And if you try to touch my shit I'll make your juice pop 
 Yes I get a two spot just for fuckin' showin' up 
 Boy it's me, T.N.T., boy I'm blowin' up 
 Nigga throw it up 
 Boy, I am the awesome 
 Call me Elroy 
 Or Mr. "Hey, how much it cost him?"

 (Verse 2: MC Chris) 
 Okay! 
 Rackin' 'em, stackin' 'em, packin' these ballers 
 Readin' these, beatin' these hoes like Carver 
 Whittle like cardboard, steady like barbers 
 I'm back and forth from the front to the starboard 
 Back up Marlin, it's only a suit 
 Like high torch 'cause he ain't get the boot 
 Like fly gossip, birds in the zoo 
 Cause the underground sound I'm reiteratin through 
 Once I'm in the mad loop, what a real man do 
 With a cannibalistic crew, when they runnin' on the loose 
 Can't handle the truth, like a fart to a scoop 
 Put my hand on the mic and my mind on the loot 
 Crime to duke, ridin' away 
 I'm a dick snub that you bothered to say 
 I get krunk then the car pull away 
 Now don't get sick got the shit on spray, okay?
