All right, Gambino is a mastermind, 
 Fuck a bitch to the pass the time, 
 Mass appeal, 
 Orange rind, 
 Smoke your green, I'm spending mine, 
 The beat is witches brew, 
 But beware this shit is potent, 
 E.e. cumming on her face, 
 Now that's poetry in motion, 
 Yeah Gambino make it work, 
 I'm the boss, move somethin', 
 Yeah, this cool fucking suits me, 
 Swag, two button, yeah 
 These girls be actin' crazy when they're dancin' Black Swan, 
 I ain't fuckin' at the club, 
 Put your clothes back on, 
 Yeah this beat is a disaster, 
 9/11 this track, 
 Rappers wanna battle me, 
 I have to mail their heads back, 
 And my clique make that dinero so it's time to meet the Fockers, 
 I am running this bitch, 
 You are just a dog walker, 
 Leavin' wit yo girl when we last seen each other, 
 Yeah you fuckin' with the baddest, 
 Like we tag team Rihanna, 
 Fly girl on her knees, 
 She don't wanna come near me, 
 Yeah, my dick is too big, 
 There's a big bang theory 
 Got her picture in my iPhone, 
 What d y'all think? 
 While you niggas masturbate I'm in that Ariel Pink, 
 If I am just a rapper, man, you coulda fooled me, 
 I'm the shit, 
 When these dudes talk, they talkin' bull me. 
 Okay I'm down with the black girls of every single culture, 
 Fillipino, Armenian girls on my sofa, 
 Yeah I like a white girl, 
 Sometimes we get together, 
 Need a thick chick, though, so it's black and yellow, black and yellow, 
 Love is a trip, 
 But fuckin' is a sport, 
 Are there Asian girls here? 
 Minority Report 
 Put your team on the map, 
 Blake Griffin on the court, 
 Niggas bitin' off my tracks, 
 Need a knife and a fork, 
 We the illest, 
 Need a nurse, 
 Here's the check, 
 Grab your purse, 
 Unless we fuckin', then I'll pay for all the food on the earth, maaaaaan, 
 I got some pussy that was insane, 
 So insane it's an enemy of Batman, 
 Dime on it, 
 Niggas call me faggot 'cause they closeted, 
 I'm hot as shit, 
 Comin' out the backside of a rocket ship, 
 It's monster shit, 
 You dudes are the opposite of Loch Nesses, 
 Respond to this, 
 We can squash the beef right now like sausages, 
 Chillin' with my N-words, 
 Say it like a white kid, 
 Yes, your booty's big as hers, 
 Say that to my white bitch, 
 So she don't get embarrassed, 
 My dick is made of carrots, 
 Bunnies wanting to be fed it, I meant honeys, oh forget it 
 I have worked all winter, 
 I will not fail summer, 
 In the back of a bush like Gavin Rossdale's drummer, 
 Yeah my stinger's in the flower, 
 I hope she let me pollinate, 
 Working hard as shit, 
 Yeah, this beat is made from concentrate, 
 Nigga can't you tell that my sample of Adele 
 Was so hot I got these hood niggas blowin' up my cell? 
 Swag out the ass, 
 I'm the man, 
 Fuck Chico, 
 Took the G out yo waffle, 
 All you got left is your ego, 
 Think about it for a second, 
 Man, we eatin', where's your breakfast? 
 Man, you hungry, have this sandwich, 
 Got my wallet, 
 Cheese and lettuce, 
 An elephant never forgets, 
 So my dick remembers everything, 
 Green inside your wallet is that pussy open sesame, 
 Running the game, 
 Fuck am I sayin'? 
 Runnin' the earth, 
 Give me a month, 
 Told all ya niggas I'm in it to win it, 
 Cause having an Emmy just wasn't enough, 
 You get sloppy drunk, 
 I stay whiskey neat, 
 My clique should be cancelled--Freaks and Geeks.
