I'm a diamond in the rough 
 Everybody knows the score 
 Bambino on top 
 And them haters claymore 
 "But the people want more!" 
 And I'mma give it to 'em 
 I was born a winner 
 All I had to do was show 'em 
 My hoodie canary yellow 
 But I'm bright on my own 
 Most haters out there take naps like combs 
 I never sleep, I'm always on my grind 
 I never eat, unless a rapper spit a rhyme 
 Sick girls jockin', haters keep hatin' 
 They pissed off 'cause I'm more eli than peyton 
 'Cause I'm the underdog, which means I'm under, dog 
 I'm not a nigga who mows snow like santa claus 
 I'm just a nigga with watermelons instead of balls 
 'Cause I work from the bottom to the top 
 I used to be lost like lot 
 Haters got a shook core like pac, get it? 
 Said the proof is in the pudding 
 The secret's in the sauce 
 I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss 
 Said the proof is in the pudding 
 The secret's in the sauce 
 I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss 
 I'm a winner (I'm a winner) (x8) 
 He work hard for the money, but it ain't about cash (oh oh, oh oh) 
 Life's a schoolyard, I ain't gettin' picked last (oh oh) 
 Better think fast, there's a pop quiz (oh oh, oh oh) 
 On which nigga get popped before his 25th (ooh) 
 Y'all niggas need to learn to live, life is awesome 
 Open up your own store, get a house in boston 
 I know it's not easy, it takes some drive 
 Some niggas get desperate like the housewives 
 And they only see fortune, they don't see wealthy 
 You can lose a fortune, wealthy is healthy 
 You can't lose wealth, it's everywhere 
 The world's made of brewster's 
 There's millions here 
 But if you richard pryor, they having the cash you get 
 And hard work and hoping and your faith is set 
 I know the world's tough 
 I was just like you 
 I used to eat lay's, now my chips are blue... 
 I said the proof is in the pudding 
 The secret's in the sauce 
 I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss 
 Say the proof is in the pudding 
 The secret's in the sauce 
 I ain't gotta tell nobody why they call me the boss 
 I'm a winner (I'm a winner) (x8) 
 Two step (two step) (x4) 
 Now bounce it out (bounce it out) (x4) 
 Fade (fade) (x4) 
 Walk it out (walk it out) (x4) 
 Go 'head (x16) 
 Yeah!
