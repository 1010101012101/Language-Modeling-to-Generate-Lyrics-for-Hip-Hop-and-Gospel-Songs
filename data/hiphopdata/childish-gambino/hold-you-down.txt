Ooh, I want it, yeah 
 Whenever you need my help 
 I'll hold you down, oh 
 Ooh, you want it, yeah 
 When the fuck these niggas 
 Tryin' to hold me down 
 You such a fuckin' lame 
 That's what they used to yell back in 7th grade 
 My mama said she'd get me that new jacket when the cost go down 
 Hit the office stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found 
 Not bad for a family of foster child 
 Lookin' fly, man I'm flossin' now. 
 But them niggas saw through me 
 Are you serious? What is this? 
 Took the jacket off third period 
 Ellipses 
 Listening to "Sky is the Limit" on my Walkman 
 Thinking if Biggie can make it through it 
 Man, than I can 
 Dope boy swag, I always wanted that 
 But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe 
 But no love for the son of a commuter 
 Who was a radiohead 
 And okay at the computers at the post office 
 It's funny how you smoke niggas 
 Then you start coffins 
 All my people need throat lozenge 
 My fear is dead 
 Ambition drove the hearse 
 When niggas get to feeling I ain't black enough to go to church 
 Culture shock in barber shops 'cause I ain't hood enough 
 We all look the same to the cops 
 Ain't that good enough? 
 The black experience is black and serious 
 'Cause being black my experience is no one hearing us 
 White kids get to wear whatever hat they want 
 When it comes to black kids one size fits all 
 We the baddest nigga 
 We the baddest nigga 
 Yeah, we the baddest nigga 
 We the baddest nigga, come on 
 (x 2) 
 The reason that they say I'm nothing 
 But they seen it hurts 
 The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls 
 They only see you how they wanna see you 
 Till you make 'em see you in some other way 
 I'm trippin' off the other day 
 'Cause God knows what these white kids say and do 
 You're not NOT racist 'cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue 
 Subtle racism, it's hard to pin it 
 'Cause you'd only understand if you were me for just a minute 
 This one kid said something that was really bad 
 He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad 
 I think that's kinda sad 
 Mostly 'cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that 
 If you're a father you should stick around if you could 
 'Cause even if you're bad at it you'll get Tiger Woods 
 Or M.J. 
 We warriors, we all need senseis 
 Change everything that we done so far 
 I don't mean make 'em BET, T-E-R 
 I mean just the way we see each other 
 I won't stop until they say James Franco 
 Is the white Donald Glover 
 Yeah, these niggas want a cookie 
 But instead I gave 'em Loch Ness 
 Sick boy for life, my swag is in the hospice 
 Aimin' for the throne 
 Jay and Ye said to watch that 
 They ask me what I'm doing 
 And I say I'm stealin' rock back
