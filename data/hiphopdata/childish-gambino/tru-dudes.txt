Is it really that bad that my clothes is tight? 
 That I hydrate babes like Pedialyte 
 That I stay rock hard like a meteorite 
 But your homeboy here was an idiot right? 
 Well, ya thought wrong, I got flavor 
 I rock shows with the blue lightsaber 
 I hit dimes but also date eighters 
 I make moves, blow up like Al-Qaeda 
 I'm in kicks that you can't buy yet 
 Ya kicks okay like your name Wyatt 
 Care Bear Clockers, pink highlighters 
 Haters wanna snack my heat like firefighters 
 Boys out there think they just like me 
 Naw naw, y'all funny, y'all from UCB? 
 Y'all standin' in line, I'm in VIP 
 Y'all know shit 'bout me like TIP, hah! 
 Ooh, bum bumbumbum bum bumbumbum 
 (Verse 2: MC Chris) 
 Think your voice's funny man, that's kind of hilarious 
 I'm the rapper makin' noise when there's shadow in your area 
 I'm like a ? 'cause I'm a little aquaceous 
 I do it for the hotties with the bodies bodacious 
 I'm high pitched, might flip if ya diss my node 
 Think Chris ain't the shit, you can kiss my chode 
 Weak ass sales, not too early to boast 
 Seriously bro, hand over the security code 
 Because my rhymes so fresh, green grocers' gotta spray 'em 
 Fired all my lawyers 'cause I didn't wanna pay 'em 
 From the PM to the AM I'll slay 'em with the sawed-off 
 Make a little money and I'll smoke the marijuana 
 MC without Glover is Matubb without Wigs 
 Jam and peanut butter with the crust cut off for kids 
 One smokes Khan, the other smokes Mids 
 Let's mix it up a little like the DJ did 
 Bacardi and Coke, black and white cookie 
 Smokin' in the alley cause you know we're playin' hooky 
 We're up to no good, please don't tell our mamas 
 ? 'Cause we got this for Obama 
 Sick of the old yellow, money like bank tellers 
 The chicks that I'm with are thicker thank Nutella 
 Y'all need to switch quick and get with a slick fella 
 'Cause I'm bout to go Rihanna like I'm an Umbrella 
 Come over to my place, we can cut like shears 
 And make some mistakes like Jamie Lynn Spears 
 I'm nasty? No. Forward? Yes 
 I'm hip to the game, you're a rook like chess 
 My money so long that they call it John Silver's 
 Your money so light that it float like pillows 
 Oopsy, killers, you can see 
 They close up shop when the clerks see me 
 I'm not Kanye, but my collar's popped 
 Cause the bro's like soda, I shit you not 
 This shit's bright orange, Fanta shade 
 You got the yellow face, that's my lemon aide 
 I'mma try to stay tight like girls that fuck hard 
 Stay in the Bay with green like Brett Farve
