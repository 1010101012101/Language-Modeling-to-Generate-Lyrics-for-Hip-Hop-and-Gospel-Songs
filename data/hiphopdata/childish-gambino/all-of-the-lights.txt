Turn on the lights in here, baby 
 Extra bright, I want y'all to see this 
 Turn on the lights in here, baby 
 Know what I mean, want you to see everything 
 Want you to see all of the-- 
 Hollerin' at this Japanese girl, Asian mommy 
 But is it too soon for Japanese girls too tsunami 
 Is it racist if I say she tastes like edamame? 
 Was I supposed to stay uncool? Please remind me 
 (What the fuck is up?) 
 Yeah, it's Cheezy, ho 
 I'm so cheesy, ho, my swag's got high cholesterol 
 I know y'all girls, I met them all 
 You're her ex-man like Cannonball 
 I ain't got shit to say to ya, I'm known for bad behavior 
 Look at me 
 Man, I went to the W from Double Tree 
 Makin' out with girls who black and yellow like a bumblebee 
 Can I live up to all this hype they have for me? It's hard to tell 
 But these girls I'm kissin' chase the blues away like Gargamel 
 I'm back in the game, coach put me in 
 T-Pain flow, All I do is Win 
 With a glass full of McCallan to mess me up 
 With the cash we can throw out unless we f-ck 
 Dopeness 
 After this I hit the highway 
 I'm headin' west like I'm f-ckin' blowin' Kanye 
 Read the f-ckin' news, Huey Lewis, n-gga 
 You can't go ham, you's a Jewish n-gga 
 Donald Glover, you don't have to call me "Childish" 
 Except for when I'm flirting with your half-Latino stylist 
 Photoshoot, beach house playin' Beach House, free wireless 
 So I can post these pictures on my Web site of her smilin' 
 I kissed this girl I've liked since back when I was just a sophomore 
 But I'm afraid to text her "What the f-ck it take so long for?!" 
 What the f-ck has changed? It it swagger? Is it money? 
 I still dress the f-ckin' same and my nose is still as ugly 
 As the day you f-ckin' met me 
 They tellin' me I'm the rapper for these white kids 
 'Cause black kids can't possibly like the same shit 
 I wanna bring you back to the studio, try and get your number 
 These black girls with natural hair who keep up with their Tumblrs 
 I like it when you tweet me, you smell like baby lotion 
 I wanna suck your breasts and finger blast to Frank Ocean 
 Her p-ssy tastes like vanilla, tasty ho 
 Clown n-ggas then I kill 'em, Gacy flow 
 It's crazy how these labels and these blogs are on my dick 
 I'm Pryor in his last years: comedian who's sick 
 F-ck, but I am sick, seriously, I don't feel so good 
 'Cause I don't get sleep, and I'm always travelin' 
 And I don't go home, and my friends don't call 
 'Cause I turned off my phone 
 I've made mistakes, I bumped my head 
 Inside of this girl, inside of my bed 
 Whatever, man, I'm just havin' fun 
 I'm sorry that I f-cked her but now you know that she's not the one 
 I'm doin' you a favor, like every time I rhyme or write a script or do a movie 
 There's a million ways to shine, choose one 
 Instead of what you're doing tonight 
 I am Donald, coming soon, we got all of the lights 
 Turn on the lights in here, baby 
 Extra bright, I want y'all to see this 
 Turn on the lights in here, baby 
 Know what I mean, want you to see everything 
 Want you to see all of the...
