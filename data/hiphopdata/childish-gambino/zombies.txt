All I see is zombies 
 Walking all around us 
 You can hear them coming 
 (They come to take your life) 
 You can hear them breathing 
 Breathing down your spine 
 Oh, all I see is zombies 
 Hear them screaming at her 
 They can smell your body 
 And they want your soul 
 If they come behind you 
 Try to stay alive 
 We're coming out to get you 
 We're all so glad we met you 
 We're eating you for profit 
 There is no way to stop it 
 You will find 
 There is no safe place to hide, hide 
 (That's right, that's right) 
 All I see is zombies 
 Feeding all around us 
 All they eat are people 
 (And you won't survive) 
 They don't know what happened 
 They just stay alive 
 We're coming out to get you 
 We're all so glad we met you 
 We're eating you for profit 
 There is no way to stop it 
 There is no way to stop it 
 You will find 
 There is no safe place to hide, hide 
 (That's right, that's right) 
 We're coming out to get you 
 We're all so glad we met you 
 We're eating you for profit 
 There is no way to stop it 
 There is no way to stop it 
 Do you feel alive, yeah? 
 Do you feel alive, yeah? 
 Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo 
 Do you feel alive?
