 Childish Gambino got that swagger 
 All these pussy niggas 'round here don't matter 
 All that I know is that I wanna dance with ya 
 Move in closer before I'm gonna kiss ya 
 Know that you know me 
 Don't act stupid 
 You seem different 
 Tired of these groupies

 Got big shots sayin', "That's that nigga" 
 HOV-y with glasses. Weezy but geeky 
 Girls in the lobby tryin' to meet me

 With their glasses, and their jacket, and their hipster clothes 
 Yes, I'm always on tour. Whatcha mad at that fo'? 
 Slammin' that thing like a Cadillac do' 
 I love fast women, Jackie Joyner-Kersee 
 Have your cake and eat it. Baby, it's your birthday 
 Baby girl, you know what I want.

 Tell me what you wanna do, I will make it happen 
 I just wanna get you home and uh, uh, uh, uh, oh 
 Yes, I'm drinking whiskey

 NBC is not the only thing I'm comin' on tonight 
 Gross! Why the fuck I say these things? 
 It isn't over, haven't heard the chubby lady sing 
 Everybody love me. Call a nigga Raymond 
 These weak niggas always in your face like Raybans 
 Yes, I bring the heat, girl. Fire, f-fireman 
 Baby, I'm your hero. Donald for Spiderman 
 I'm in love with you, but this is not Tennis 
 And baby stay stacked like she bad at Tetris 
 Rude boy, I Rihanna that vagina 
 Tell your boy, good luck tryin' to find ya 
 Baby girl, you know what I want.
