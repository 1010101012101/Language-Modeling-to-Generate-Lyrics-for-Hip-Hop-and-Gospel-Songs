Don't go, gotta know 
 Please don't run away, I'm a murderer 
 What can I say? 
 Don't go, gotta know 
 Please don't run away 
 I'm a murderer 
 What does that change? 
 Can't sleep 
 3 A.M., stare at the ceilin', murder the feelin' 
 Spider crawl in the corner, brown recluse 
 So appropriate, cornucopia 
 So be it, say I'm over it 
 Playin' Lil Durk, 
 "Dis Ain't What U Want" 
 Look at my feet, I put my sneakers in the trunk 
 Pass a Fatburger through Atwater 
 Laugh for a minute, couldn't cry for the life of me 
 Park by the bridge, sit on the hood, look at the cars 
 Stare at my hands, look at the moon 
 I can't find it, it's gone 
 What's wrong? Didn't respond when I texted you last night 
 Yo alright? Yeah 
 Don't go, gotta know 
 Please don't run away, I'm a murderer 
 What can I say? 
 Don't go, gotta know 
 Please don't run away, I'm a murderer 
 What does that change? 
 Man there's a star bound to a body inside of me 
 Twenty million degrees, burn a man to his knees 
 Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry and half of an apple pie 
 When I'm laughin', I'm satisfied, when I'm dyin', I'm still alive 
 Strange position 
 I'm in a good mood 
 So good I'mma kill that spider 
 Them kinda things they told me 
 When I'm lonely it only makes me violently gitty 
 Go home, lock the door 
 Pull out the clothes, watch cartoons for an hour 
 Turn off the lights 
 Look at the recluse 
 Look at the recluse 
 Look at the recluse 
 Look at the rec- 
 Don't go, gotta know 
 Please don't run away, I'm a murderer 
 What can I say? 
 Don't go, gotta know 
 Please don't run away, I'm a murderer 
 What does that change? 
 Don't go 
 Don't go 
 Don't go
