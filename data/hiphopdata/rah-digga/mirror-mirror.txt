 Mom and ddad taught me to stay outta trouble but no one can prepare you for life's inner struggles the test of your courage when you're scared to death or the test of Faith winning sinners right and left the test of your strength when you're making life choices, I swear swear sometimes I be hearing strange voices following advice my grandma gave me, crazy think I've been seeing her lately she told me nothing in life was free be nice to folks who are nice to me to turn the other cheek in most confrantations no matter how bleak the situation oh, but most things I had to learn on my own like what I'm gonna do by the time I got grown would've been nice to see a baby in a movie multimedia your truly, c'mon

 The moral of the story is who knows what glory is? who just idling who the real warrior is? who the type that make their own fate? who the go-getters? who sit back and wait? went from hanging on a park bench to a range rover with darken tints 5-bedroom apartments never fear new music was my calling whatever else come Digga Digga put her all in it at this point I figure any path I'm at whether sing, rap, or act, or just fade to black now wonder why I motivate like that? so I can live like a baller even if I don't play I'm a tell you this much I'm a always have a plan can't leave you well-being in somebody else hands the choice is yours I'm a do my bit cause everybody dies but not every body lives
