(Sean Price) 
 The first verse is the worst 
 Like why the fuck they call you Jesus Price, nigga? 
 And you curse in church 
 Napoleon complex, niggas earth your Lurch 
 Fuck a hook, nigga, earth my turf 
 Nah I mean, gave a pound of vile pork, beat Malachai off 
 Had to slap him in the face, with a Ballantine cloth 
 Silverback Sean's happy on songs, I ain't dissing 
 Just you muthafuckas listening wrong, listen 
 Cock diesel niggas smoking on crack, Tony Atlas 
 Flash forward flowing, ???you Thelonious baskets??? 
 I mastered the style and mastered the styles 
 I fight the fair one then blast a round wit the pound 
 Sean is the best, y'all niggas is the opposite, pa 
 Shut the fuck up, put a sock in it, pa, be quiet 
 I put a hole in ya hat, Jesus Price soul controller of rap, amen 
 (Chorus: Flood) 
 This that hard body shit, pump shotty shit 
 Niggas shooting the party up over a bitch, shit 
 This that ignorant shit, niggas pull a trigger, quick 
 This what ignorance is, yeah fire and all this 
 If you dealing with bricks, then we gon' take it 
 And if you dealing with chips, then we gon' take it 
 But if you dealing wit tips, ma, then shake it 
 'Cause my niggas is in this bitch, and that's crazy 
 (Buckshot) 
 It's the five foot gorilla with the mind of a killa 
 Killing every nigga in sight, murdered by ya mirror 
 Ill reflections of protectin ya face 
 Bitches tucking in they necklace when I step in the place 
 Niggas acting like they hard, but they soft as Jell-O 
 You can tell them niggas pussy, when they walk by, hello 
 I know, I was scoping you, was hoping I fall 
 Like a pair of over sized shorts, no, not at all 
 I'm not the one, but I got that two 
 And if you need me to add on more, I bring it through 
 'Cause I got a trunk for niggas who say they ain't scared 
 Go for your gun, I let my mac ten braid ya hair 
 With a little style, I call presto change-o 
 When the bullets in the chamber, I press it to change, yo 
 Right back atcha, with the knife and bat atcha 
 Better ask you could I smack you, if I didn't, I was glad to 
 (Chorus: Flood) 
 This that hard body shit, pump shotty shit 
 Niggas shooting the party up over a bitch, shit 
 This that ignorant shit, niggas pull a trigger, quick 
 This what ignorance is, yeah fire and all this 
 If you dealing with bricks, then we gon' take it 
 And if you dealing with chips, then we gon' take it 
 But if you dealing wit tips, ma, then shake it 
 'Cause my niggas is in this bitch, and that's crazy 
 (Ruste Juxxe) 
 Yeah, burn a good tree from the yard, then 
 Juxxe make you lick shots pon de squad, then 
 I rock rock wit that bang bang boogie 
 Stomp through hot blocks with that thang thang wit me 
 It's all gravy and mashed potatoes, I smash haters 
 Bust bullets, blast tazers, slash razors 
 Say my rap sheet is longer than my wrap sheet 
 Young niggas ask me, rhyming to a rap beat 
 Crack in the days of the eighties 
 Produced alotta inner city hood crack babies 
 Bird niggas moving like a chicken with his throat slit 
 But I bet I lean 'em when I hit 'em wit this dope shit 
 Never slip, slack off and blowing your back off 
 Niggas is wack soft, we throwing your track off 
 Never got a pack off, fuck the jack off 
 I'mma let the latch off and pop ya cap off 
 (Chorus: Flood) 
 This that hard body shit, pump shotty shit 
 Niggas shooting the party up over a bitch, shit 
 This that ignorant shit, niggas pull a trigger, quick 
 This what ignorance is, yeah fire and all this 
 If you dealing with bricks, then we gon' take it 
 And if you dealing with chips, then we gon' take it 
 But if you dealing wit tips, ma, then shake it 
 'Cause my niggas is in this bitch, and that's crazy
