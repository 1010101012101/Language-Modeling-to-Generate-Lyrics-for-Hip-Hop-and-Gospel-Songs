Take a minute girl come sit down 
 And tell us what's been happening 
 In your face I can see the pain 
 Don't you try to convince us that you're happy 
 We've seen this all before 
 But he's taking advantage of your passion 
 Because we've come too far 
 For you to feel alone 
 You don't let him walk all over your heart 
 I'm telling you 
 Girl, I can tell you been crying 
 And you needing someone to talk to 
 Girl, I can tell he's been lying 
 And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you 
 Girl, you don't have to be hiding 
 Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you 
 I'm your girl, you're my girl, we're your girls 
 Don't you know that we love you 
 See what y'all don't know about him 
 Is I can't let him go because he needs me 
 It ain't really him its stress from the job 
 And I ain't making it easy 
 I know you see him bugging on me sometimes 
 But I know he be tired he don't mean it 
 It gets hard sometimes 
 But I need my man 
 I don't think y'all understand 
 I'm telling you 
 Girl, take a good look at yourself 
 He got you going through hell 
 We ain't never seen you down like this 
 What you mean you don't need us to help 
 We known each other too well 
 Girl, 
 I'm your girl, you're my girl, we're your girls 
 Don't you know that we love you
