My music represent the change of power 
 From now on this thing is ours 
 Got 'em painting walls instead of painting flowers 
 They shower their heroes with praises while we hanging ours 
 We bring the drums to the battle 'cause we bang the loudest 
 You don't know a thing about it 
 If you mix a King and Malcolm bet you that Kweli the outcome 
 Album is so hot that my ghetto chicks is bringing talcum 
 Whether you sing or shout it 
 They gave somebody else the crown, but I'm a king without it 
 Your queen is riding with me, she always sliding with me 
 You can't stop me like them bullets that's inside of 50 
 They try to diss me but whenever I say bye they miss me, 
 You walking with me or you alien like Mork and Mindy 
 You talk with me so often if you take it off the table 
 When the devil wanna label cause the lord is withe me 
 Arrogance bring fall of many 
 My name echo like the hall is empty you don't wanna war against me 
 Hey if this the cut I'm the surgeon 
 Assassinate your character cast aspersions 
 You ain't gotta verse better than my worst one 
 You ain't gotta verse better than my worst one 
 Hey, I know I hurt son, but you against me a 50 cal versus squirt gun 
 You ain't gotta verse better than my worst one 
 You ain't gotta verse better than my worst one 
 Why you and your man's some palookas you scared mama Tulla 
 You see beyond the shadow of a doubt I'm born ready 
 Steady as the hand of the shooter 
 In the flesh yes the embodiment of man versus computer 
 I make all the women abandon their suitors 
 Do the math you see you can't measure up to the ruler 
 Word, on behalf of all the fans and consumers 
 I'm building with Fred Hampton Jr. man we planning the future 
 Not preaching we do it different we lifting the youth up 
 We spitting it to tough too sick for these new thugs 
 Goons whatever they called they softer than nubuck 
 Vampires in the club sipping that True Blood 
 I'm a midnight marauder and a slaughter for the tribe 
 Immortal I'm busting at the cops like Mordecai 
 Just so the God'll mortify these clown ass rappers 
 Stand fortified live and you know it man 
 Hey if this the cut I'm the surgeon 
 Assassinate your character cast aspersions 
 You ain't gotta verse better than my worst one 
 You ain't gotta verse better than my worst one 
 Hey, I know I hurt son, but you against me a 50 cal versus squirt gun 
 You ain't gotta verse better than my worst one 
 You ain't gotta verse better than my worst one 
 Sean Price mad nice accept that 
 My worst verse sound like your best rap 
 Put down your bet pack I pay double on trips 
 I punch you up in your face and double your lips 
 This be the dumbest shit I ever wrote 
 No Tupac Shakur just two shots you floor listen 
 The gun clapper, the dumb rapper, the young rapper 
 Dig in your pockets and leave with your funds faster 
 Fuck it new rap rookies 
 Get beat to death New Jack Pookie 
 Face fucked with the 8 stuck in your grill 
 Play tough and get strength up in the ville 
 Afro American minus the afro 
 Bald headed American letting the gat blow 
 Shut the fuck up before you get hurt son 
 You ain't got a verse better than my worst one 
 Hey if this the cut I'm the surgeon 
 Assassinate your character cast aspersions 
 You ain't gotta verse better than my worst one 
 You ain't gotta verse better than my worst one 
 Hey, I know I hurt son, but you against me a 50 cal versus squirt gun 
 You ain't gotta verse better than my worst one 
 You ain't gotta verse better than my worst one
