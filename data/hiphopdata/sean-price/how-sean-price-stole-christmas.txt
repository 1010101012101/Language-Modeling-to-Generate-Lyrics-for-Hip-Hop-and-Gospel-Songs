Fuck Christmas! Fuck this shit! 
 Stick my dick in a box! Fuck this gift! 
 You sleepin', that's the cousin of death 
 I take every gift under the tree till they ain't none left 
 I'm a mean one: call me Mr. Grinch 
 Unwashed socks and Glock make niggas flinch 
 Thief by night, down to fuckin' with day 
 Wash my nuts with your toothbrush you had on display 
 I don't give a shit! I ain't gettin' shit! 
 I hate spittin' this, plus I hate Saint Nicholas! 
 You wake up while I'm takin' a shit 
 That's when I smack blood out your little innocent bitch--BONG! 
 Candy cane, ain't no 'caine in the candy 
 Just some sugary bullshit--the treat look fancy 
 Fuck you and your Christmas tree 
 I'm the Grinch; you can call me P, motherfucker! 
 Yo! 'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the Ps 
 Was a motherfuckin' thief, and his name was P 
 He still sold drugs and occasionally shoot shit 
 No ho-ho-hos, but he stay in some new kicks 
 I beanbag on easter: I like to choke rabbits 
 For now, I'm with Rudolph--he got a coke habit 
 Better believe P wordplay 
 Almost feel guilty 'cause it's Jesus' birthday 
 Peace!
