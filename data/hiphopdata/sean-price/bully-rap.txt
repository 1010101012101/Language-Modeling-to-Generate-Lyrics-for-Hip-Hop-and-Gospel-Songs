Nigga kill yourself! 
 Faggot-ass nigga, die 
 Uh, this that brownsville bully rap 
 Hoodie rap, take a nigga chain, smoke the goodie trap 
 Surrounded by the wolves in the wilderness 
 Liquor piss, slit your wrists so niggas won't get pistol-whipped 
 Mo' niggas won't get pistol-whipped 
 If I was you, then I'd probably have to slit my wrists 
 Sean price, the villain beatin' any feelin' this 
 Slit your wrists, so niggas won't get pistol-whipped

 Split head like red sea power of moses 
 Due to my weight gain I had to double the dosage 
 Of drugs that I do, a nigga stay toasted

 Ruck keep you slumped in the pom-pom 
 Listen; god is the greatest, allahu akbar

 Use your baby organs just to make a baby organ
