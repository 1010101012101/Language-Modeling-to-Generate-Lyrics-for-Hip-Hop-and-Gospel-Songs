You can bob to the beat bitch, 
 Hop on my meat quick 
 Hop off, pop off, Ruck on some street shit. 
 Corney as hell, y'all motherfuckers bore me as well 
 Listen up I got a story to tell, listen, nigga 
 Creep, clutch, fifth 
 Heat, bust, quick 
 You die, I laugh, street justice. 
 When I set it off, I said it god 
 I want his chain, watch, car keys and credit card 
 Shop with a gun, shank with a knife 
 Catch a hollow, take your Movado 
 I'm a gangsta for life. 
 No Spanish, No Reggaton 
 I do damage, heavy when the dezzy blown 
 *Pow pow* 
 Shit get ugly, 
 Day and Night we sell dope label it "Kid Cudi" 
 Coke habits, deviated septums 
 Broke ratchets, depreciated weapons 
 Pull your vest out now, 
 Say Sean is the best out now, motherfucker 
 Listen, I am the truth hoe 
 Money stack so tall when I ball, Manute Bol 
 You can bob to the beat bitch, 
 Hop on my meat quick 
 Hop off, pop off, Ruck on some street shit. 
 Motherfucker.
