Girl: I hate gossip 
 Sean: Me too 
 Girl: And I don't go walkin' around lookin' for it, you know. 
 Sean: Pssh, I don't even go outside 
 Girl: But yesterday it seemed to just want around till it found me, you know like gossip found me 
 Sean: Probably going to get some cigarettes... 
 Girl: Then why don't you try proving it... how? ... you don't know how to prove it ?... well what you just do is... STOP 
 *Street Runners* 
 Sean Price: 
 Stop, hatin' on the god 
 Liar liar pants on fire, perpetratin' the fraud 
 The shit you pop doesn't reverberate with the god 
 The eight shake and raise the murder rate, oh my god 
 *Oh my god* 
 I am the best to do it, repeat, I am the best to do it 
 Defeat all the rest who knew it 
 Sneak attack, eagle eat your back you blew, stupid 
 Truth is, I am smarter than your average Joe, Bear, or Jesus or Nazareth 
 Battleship Battleshit Battleship 
 I ain't playing games bitch 
 Gat'll click gravel pit, that'll be your grave bitch 
 My shit it, off the meter, off the reefer, awkward, I talk with heater 
 I walk with, orthopedic features, coughin', why? 'cause I eat the creatures often, abortion. 
 Flood Diesel: 
 Stop analyzing, and realize that 
 We them guys y'all niggas really idolizing 
 Great advertising, four-day sodomized em 
 While a nigga in school, quick to Columbine em 
 Police lookin' for me, couldn't fuckin' find em 
 Then I got consignment, then I copped some diamonds 
 Did my time then came home, and I was fuckin' poppin' 
 He don't know me, when I robbed him son I rocked the stocking 
 Even sold him chocolate, before I dug his pockets 
 Girl said I need to stop it, yeah I know I need to profit 
 You ain't with my man? 
 You the fuckin' target, Flood and Sean P again, cop that shit at Target. 
 They said, I tried to open up the market 
 I say I OJ him, open up the carcass 
 Even taste the blood, shit, that's a starving artist 
 ACG's in your face like sorry (?)
