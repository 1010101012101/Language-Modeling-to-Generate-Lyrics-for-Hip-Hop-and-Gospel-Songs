 (Sean P) 
 Ayo the arm-leg-leg or arm, head Megatron 
 Decepticon Sean duke you my name 
 Fuck around and send your ass back from where you came 
 Back in the dirt, back in the earth, back off my turf 
 Clap cowards, black power, black, red, green and shit 
 Smoke sum, but sell powder 'cause crack-heads be needin shit 
 Pssh, I'm in the hotel with ganja 
 Dope needles, Dom Chee and Hotel Rwanda 
 Go get your partner, Rock ain't here nigga 
 Go get your momma, my cock right here 
 I got this here, it's a different doctrine here 
 Fuck if the cops aware, you get popped in here 
 Listen, I fear no man but God 
 Matter fact, duke I am the God, P-Body 
 Four eyes, two arms and three shotties 
 Got shit on lock like Irv and Gene Gotti 
 A mean mommy from Puerto Rico who sell pedico 
 And for the right price princess will pop at your people 
 P-Body 
 "Knowhatimsayin', I mean this is me"

 P! Pound for pound perfection, and punch potholes in pretenders 
 Pay attention it's gon pop off 
 Body get beat, embody the street 
 Anybody get bodied when its beef, introducing P-Body 
 (Sean P) 
 You supposed lie to cops and tell the truth in the booth 
 Instead you tell the truth to the cops and lie in the booth 
 Fuck a backward ass rapper get smack with the gat happily 
 Boom-shack-shack and the cannon backup your faculty 
 The left hook'll shatter your chin 
 Similar to Darryl Dawkins when he shattered the rim 
 Niggas get mad at my Timbz and my thousand dollar jeans all year 
 Boot Camp, bitch recognize my team's strong 
 Nigga, kneel down, kiss the ring 
 R. Kelly a verse when I piss on your sixteen 
 Nigga rap Prime Minister pah, President P 
 Pop off my pistol partially parched pass the tea 
 Truth be told, God top rankin' I'm not thinking 
 Saying whatever, love it when I put it together 
 Listen, y'all bitch niggas probably Punani 
 I bust a shot, you start running for mommy, P-Body 
 (Hook: Rock) 
 P! Pound for pound perfection, and punch potholes in pretenders 
 Pay attention it's gon pop off 
 Body get beat, embody the street 
 Anybody get bodied when its beef, introducing P-Body 
 Partnah, we practically pioneered this position 
 You punks pop shit, he popping the heaters 
 You gon see a body, somebody gon be a body 
 Some body probably gonna need a body transplant 
 P-Body 
 (Sean P) 
 Listen this is the BCC, and double D 
 In the 2k6, we make hits 
 We make chips, I'm always stacking my dough 
 Can't be the "Brokest Rapper You Know", P-Body 
 Yeah, get money or get lost 
 Or get your shit split, when lickin' the fifth off 
 This ain't no gangsta rap 
 How many muthafuckin gangsters rap? listen 
 I mean, truthfully you might think you that 
 But overall dude I think you wack, P-Body 
 The name is new, the face the same 
 The judge is wack, the case is lame 
 I love the rap but I hate the game 
 Matter fact, bitch, what's my name, P-Body
