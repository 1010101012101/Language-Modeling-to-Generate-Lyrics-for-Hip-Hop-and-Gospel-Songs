(Sean Price) 
 Ayo, listen 
 Big word halitosis, multiple scoliosis 
 Doctor Kill, giving the rap dosage 
 Postage stamped, signed, sealed, delivered 
 Distributed through the hood, muthafucka, what's good? 
 Exciting, unorthodox, biting, ought to stop fighting 
 Fuck it, now I'm forced to box 
 You got 22 tattoos, you 2Pac a tad too much, 
 Touch like 2Pac, dude, that sucks 
 Smack saliva, out the side of ya face, I ain't trying to be rude 
 But dude, you food, so I gotta make grace, choir -- 
 (Jesus Price has all the time) 
 Yeah, all praises due to the rhyme, y'all niggas is foul 
 Fuck it, Sean'll shoot two from the line 
 Two for the nine, I leave lead in ya jaw 
 Yo Rock these niggas ain't ready for war, let 'em know 
 (Rock) 
 I told 'em, these niggas ain't ready for retardation 
 In it's realest form in rap, this street car racing 
 Rebellious, rederic, heat start blazing 
 After that, I seen Caucasians, in the streets all taping shit up 
 They could be trying to piece y'all faces back together 
 You keep on playing, you hit 
 (Sean Price) 
 Yeah, The Loudmouf Choir, luger lifting your name 
 The word-a-matician, magician, David Blaine on your chain 
 (Chorus 2x: Loudmouf Choir) 
 Oops upside your head, we smack you oops upside your head 
 You wearing suits and a tie when your dead 
 And eating soup with the noodles and eggs 
 (Rock) 
 Ok, new word, respecanize my gangstafication and g-dentials 
 You scared to fire, banging your face through ya Jeep window 
 Get ya window shot up, in a residential area 
 And left, fuck a ocean and sea, meant you 
 This time it's the principality, punk 
 You a point to prove, put the pistol back, you'se a punk 
 Push your shit all the way off, or producer para-loser 
 Yeah, pussy, that's you, chump 
 All that yackety yackety, your teeth, where the animals be 
 You get your ass beat, baddily, gradilly, P, Alkatraz 
 And the Beast Master, take a stab at me 
 The O'Connor red dots on ya face like bad acne 
 Nappy piece to be praying for y'all niggas 
 While I'm getting my vulture on, preying on y'all bitches, choir 
 (Ruck, Rock, Ruck N Roll,???????????) 
 Yeah that's how I got my Bronx bitch, she breakdance and bomb trains 
 The fifty pop blocker, while giving me bomb brains 
 ?????????, And she go all way 
 She gone, go where I say, she know where y'all stay, suckas 
 (Sean Price) 
 Yeah, y'all niggas 'ready to die', blast the sket 
 And then you realize, ain't no fucking 'life after death' 
 Smash your chest with a fucking medicine ball 
 You think you nice, but I'm better than y'all 
 Listen, Tommy Tee on the beat, Loudmouf is the Choir 
 Heltah Skeltah on they job, and you fuckas is fired 
 (Rock) 
 The fire supplier, forget your squad 
 Nigga, I'm dope like the tits on Oz, get your nod off 
 (Chorus 2x: Loudmouf Choir) 
 Oops upside your head, we smack you oops upside your head 
 You wearing suits and a tie when your dead 
 And eating soup with the noodles and eggs
