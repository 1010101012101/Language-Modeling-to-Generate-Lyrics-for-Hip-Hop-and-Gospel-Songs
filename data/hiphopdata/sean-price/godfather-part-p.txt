All right now, pay attention to the god body Sean P 
 Smackin' you niggers with the sket kid 
 Sean, illest nigger to, smack earth, wind and fire 
 And make y'all nigga straight retire 
 You get mad glory, and your flow is mad corney 
 You're tight-ass clothes put you in the fag category 
 You're funny style like Brad's brother Corey 
 You;re broker than a fuckin' joke, like half on a 40 
 I blast on a shorty, young and out of his mind 
 Get your snot-box rocked in the box that's pine 
 Flesh, turn to maggots and worms just like swine 
 I'll kill ya whole squad pa with just one line 
 I'm god, cypher divine, all tight with the rhyme 
 A weirdo, I hear those lines, waste of time 
 Y'all can't fuck around with pa, please 
 It's the G.O.D (father god P ?)
