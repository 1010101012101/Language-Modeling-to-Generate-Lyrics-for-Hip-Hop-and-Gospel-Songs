Sean Price: 
 Ayo think about it, wait, erase your rhyme 
 Forget it... don't waste your time 
 I raise the nine, never give you bozos love 
 Omar from The Wire, yous a homo thug 
 Use your head for more than a hat rack 
 'Fore I choose to use the lead to fuck up your hat rack 
 Peep the knapsack backpack vibe 
 Used to ride the Amtrak with a knapsack with crack inside 
 Back to the rhyme, listen pah, Ruck in the place 
 Not the deep voiced dude with the cut on his face 
 I love Allah but I act Christian 
 Mix a lot then I'm back pitchin like I got the facts missin' 
 The whack rendition of rap you spittin' 
 Makes me wanna clap but I can't go back to prison 
 Black people unite, let's all get down 
 'Fore I slap people tonight, with the long trey pound 
 You better... 
 You better stop boy... [x3] 
 You better stop, fuck around lay around 
 Sean Price: 
 Ayo stop look and listen 
 We smoke pot plus we cook crack in the kitchen 
 The weed is green, the paper's brown 
 The coke is white, youse a bitch and so is your wife 
 Straight hell is what I give a brother 
 Smack a cracker callin Dru Ha a nigga lover 
 You just mad Buck and Dru won't fuck with you 
 You like "Fuck Duck Down!" Nah pah, fuck you 
 I'm not an artist, I'm the President 
 Gimme the word I'll set fire to your residence 
 It's evident by the way that I act, way that I move 
 Sean Price ain't a kid that can act, nothin' to prove, bung 
 Choose to lose, I choose to win 
 One hand hit the rib the other bruise the chin 
 I remember when DJ's would check for a record 
 Now these niggaz want a cheque for a record 
 Motherfuckers better... 
 You better stop, and think about it 
 Yeah, you better stop boy 
 This is Duck Down for life, this is Duck Down for life 
 You better stop, this is Duck Down for life, stupid nigga 
 This is Duck Down for life, let's go
