Sean Price: 
 Listen. 
 Big bang theory hear me Sean born 
 Fresh out my moms pussy, Sean born porn 
 Sean long gone, somebody bring him back 
 He's moving too slow, somebody bring him crack 
 He's moving too fast, somebody bring him dope 
 Fucked up in the dirt, somebody give him soap 
 Clean up my act, write a few violent songs 
 But they whack, like Glen Rice with new balance on 
 Dominque wore brooks, Sean P wore crooks 
 And castles, smack whoever give long looks 
 Baffled, the mind rhyme designed is outlandish 
 Like copping coke from poppy not understanding Spanish 
 Understand the damage of the incredible Ruck 
 Puff green, get mean, swing and your shit get bust 
 Tough, Tonka truck four by four 
 Guns out, you rubbed out, all out war 
 P!
