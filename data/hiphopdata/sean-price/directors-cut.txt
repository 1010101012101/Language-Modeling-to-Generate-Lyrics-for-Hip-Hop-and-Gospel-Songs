Yeah the feeling is mutual 
 You hate me, I hate you, this the part where I shoot at you 
 *All right in this scene, the rapper disses you, here's the gun aaand action!* 
 Ayo, idle threats from you rappers don't move me 
 I know tough, and you niggers straight out the movies 
 *And cut! That was a good one, that was a good one, get ready for the next shot* 
 Shorty, you treated with class, I treat it like dirt 
 I put my, dick in the ass and my hand in the purse 
 P! 
 " Oh I can fuck you in your ass, fuck around and catch somethin', but I can't get no motherfuckin card man, punk bitch" 
 Ayo, its nothing to throw the gat to you guys 
 I wouldn't do it cause rattin' at an all time high, you'd probably do it. 
 "Them niggas talk too much man, signin statement after ??????? man" 
 Y'all motherfuckers weak and you frail 
 I'm not fool I went to war with the 'ricans in jail, I'm old school 
 Piece to Ike Oz, Ag Allah, my man PF cuttin' on my Spanish niggas, what up 
 Mater fact I took your sneakers in jail, 
 Cut your cheek, blood, skeet, next week I make bail 
 Word up, the fresh new envy's, the white and burgundy ones 
 Ayo, chillin' in the city is hard 
 Niggas bugged out livin' like the "City Of God" 
 Understand?
