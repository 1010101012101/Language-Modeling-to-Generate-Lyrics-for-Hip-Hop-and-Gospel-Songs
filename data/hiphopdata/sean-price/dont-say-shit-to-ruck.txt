 Heat Holders Weed Blowers straight livin' la vida loca 
 Over all the protocals to chase the cheedar 
 Get this dough then retire like Masen Betha

 I should dig in your pockets and take your leather 
 Pull a gun up on ya ass now you talk about wait

 Tinted high off of the weed my son was sent to buy

 Stash dough if not then its back to packing the black four
