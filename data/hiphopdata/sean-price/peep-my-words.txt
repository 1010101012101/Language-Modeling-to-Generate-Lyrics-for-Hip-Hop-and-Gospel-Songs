(Sean Price) 
 I'm better than mine, Sean Price, remember this time 
 I'm all that, jaw tapped, pa, Gregory Hines 
 Strapped from the wall, I got a package of raw 
 In the ass crack of his whore in the passenger door 
 Y'all niggas is wack in this shit, get slapped with the four 
 Shit like that be a crack in the law 
 Can't get knocked, better yet, can't be shot 
 Bust a shot at the 'bad boy', can't be stopped 
 Listen to my old shit, they be like 'damn they hot 
 What happened to them niggas, man, they flopped', word 
 Drinkin' and smoking, vice verse, smoking and drinking 
 I'm hoping it's linking, tied up, I ain't suppose to be stinking 
 Y'all niggas is farsighted, didn't notice the kingpin 
 Up close in your face, bust toast in your face 
 (Chorus: Sean Price) 
 Peep my words, words, heavenly word, words 
 Stackin' niggas locked up in the 73rd 
 Peep my words, words, heavenly word, words 
 Stackin' niggas locked up, locked up, locked up 
 (Sean Price) 
 Aiyo, I'm bustin' the cronz, call be Ruckus 
 But Sean's the name that I choose to be called 
 When I'm in front of my moms 
 Kid, what the fuck is in front of me pa 
 The number one stunner ready for y'all, listen 
 I got little guns that'll straight pounce ya melon 
 Got big guns about the size of Mount St. Helen 
 Soon as I punch a nigga, be like 'Ouch, I'm tellin'" 
 Gotta bounce down south with Welling, what up 'cause 
 I'm Sean Price, watch me lead this shit 
 Boot Camp, no fatigue and kicks, nigga 
 Y'all niggas is straight fake, perpetrating the fraud 
 Give me the cake so I insert the 8th in your broad 
 Scared to death, niggas going face to face with the lord 
 The amount, bang ya motherfuckin' face in this board 
 Fuck around and catch wreck in this spot, scared to go pop 
 Heckler and Koch, reckon your not, fled from the cops
