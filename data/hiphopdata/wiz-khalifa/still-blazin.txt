Usually I make a weed song so here go a weed song (2X) 
 Still blazin' (3X) 
 The ganja power so amazing, 
 Give my the strength on proctection keep raisin each an every day 
 Why can't everyone just smoke like me 
 Just gimmie quite place and let me roll my weed, 
 Where ain't nobody in my business 
 Don't nobody gotta no, let all your conscience go 'n' blow it by the Ooh, 
 I'm here but my minds gone, 
 And its gettin' hard to see you cause my eyes low, 
 Marijuana minute nigga times slow, 
 On a kush clock so its time to smoke, 
 Say I look high I say I'm high bro, 
 Still blazin' on wit me jus facin, 
 I remember days wen, I culd only smoke on occasions, 
 I couldn't wait to go 'n' cop from ray 'n' them, 
 Rolln blunts of 50 stuck and my moms basement, 
 Had dro for sell but niggas was smoking haze then, 
 Blew a O a day then, don't know but some how I made a way, 
 N nigga them bills need pay but I'm, 
 Still blazin' (3X) 
 The ganja power so amazing, 
 Give my the strength on proctection keep raisin each an every day 
 Why can't everyone jus smoke like me, 
 Just get up out my face and let me roll my weed,

 And I'm gonna reup as soon as the fires gone, 
 Smoking og kush from another time zone (time zone), 
 As the smoke begins to pile on, wettin rags and puttin' bags over the fire alarm, 
 You niggas styrofoam lightweights

 You off that good needa nice brake, 
 See I roll Jays up all day and you won't have to put a 8th in 
 They sayin' its amazing how I'm, 
 Still blazin' (3X)
