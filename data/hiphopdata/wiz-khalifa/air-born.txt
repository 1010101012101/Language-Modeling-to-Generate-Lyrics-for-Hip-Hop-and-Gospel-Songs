Yeah 
 Damn 
 Hold on turn me up a little bit more 
 Yeah bitch 
 Always wanted to do this shit 
 This is it what 
 Luccini (in front of) 
 Ugh Ugh Ugh Nigga Yeah 
 Fresh up off the plane 
 Real niggas embrace my music 
 And bitches go insane 
 Even the kids throwing up the gang? 
 They don't bother pronouncing my name 
 They just look at my chain 
 Boy how much you spent on it? 
 This ain't nothing but hard work 
 And what you can get from it 
 Ain't no toilet paper 
 But this smell like the shit don't it? 
 Smoking chronic and drinking pints 
 Till we get sick stomach 
 And them suckers ain't gotta like it, 'cause your bitch love it 
 I'm a roll it, she gon' light it 
 Tell me she in desperate need of a pilot 
 I told her kick her feet up 
 We gone go do my pit soon as I roll this weed up 
 Call some friends of yours and we could all have a smoke out 
 You ain't gotta hold it too long, 
 This is rapper weed 
 Couple hits is all you go need 
 In my versace frames, I blaze, somewhere on a Island 
 Smokin' some ray, middle of the day, drunk dialing 
 Be surprised at how high a nigga get 
 I'm a different kinda fly, we ain't on the same shit, nigga 
 I won't lannnd

 No need to apologize you should know how fly niggas do 
 Only ez-widers, been done with them cigarillos fool 
 I been on the road, shopping and killin' them interviews 
 Heard I just left a major deal, but my paper major still 
 All of them fans in love with me 'cause I say what's real 
 So I could never give a fuck how a hater feel 
 But uh, every time they send a driver for me and Will 
 I call it, doin' my talkin' on the field 
 At first niggas was tuff, they don't wanna be gangsta's now 
 Traces of my flow, yeah they copy and paste my style 
 Wouldn't think I would notice it 
 While in my hotel, smokin' wit yo Bitch, FOOL! haha 
 And this is it what, relax your feet, put on some music, roll a zip up 
 And we gon smoke until its gone, never see me cuff 
 Can't speak for sucka's who do 
 Because I'm G'd up, what! haha
