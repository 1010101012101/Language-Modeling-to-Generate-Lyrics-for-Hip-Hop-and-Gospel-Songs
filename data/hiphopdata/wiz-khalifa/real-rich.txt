Guwop! wiz! 
 Taylor Gang, 1-0-1-7 
 Ridin' around blow so much dope 
 But I'm always handlin' business 
 Way too high don't pick up my phone 
 If I do, I'm like "who is this?" 
 I ain't got time for a girlfriend 
 Tell that bitch that I got no feelings 
 Young nigga straight from the bottom 
 Got no ceilings 
 Young nigga stackin up M's 
 Young niggas actin' like children 
 Baby I'm a rich ass nigga never said it's gon easy to deal with it 
 But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit 
 Baby I'm a rich ass nigga never said it's gon easy to deal with it 
 But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit 
 I'm a country-ass Beverly hill-billy 
 Eat it up bitch, I'ma meal ticket 
 Flush it down concert like fuck a ticket 
 Rich-ass, crazy-ass, super picky 
 Want a rich dick say I'm bucket listed 
 I don't fuck broke I got a boujee dick 
 First round draft, I'ma lottery pick 
 Pepped up East Atlanta vitamins shit 
 Solitaires glarin' 
 Big stone like Sharon 
 Superstar, Ed Sheeran 
 Bitches love my earrings 
 Know she fucked wit him, I still fucked her 
 Fuck that nigga, he a real sucka 
 It's the Wiz and the Wizop 
 I baguetted my watch wit' real boogers 
 Baby I'm a rich ass nigga never said it's gon easy to deal with it 
 But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit 
 Baby I'm a rich ass nigga never said it's gon easy to deal with it 
 But I be on some real shit, but I be on some real shit
