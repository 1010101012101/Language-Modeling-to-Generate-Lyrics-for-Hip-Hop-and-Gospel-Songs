Nigga, yeah, fresh up off the plane 
 Real niggas embrace my music and bitches go insane 
 Even they kids throwin' up the gang 
 They don't bother pronouncin' my name 
 They just look at my chain 
 Boy how much you spent on it? 
 This ain't nothin' but hard work 
 And what you can get from it 
 Ain't no toilet paper but this smell like the shit 
 Don't it? 
 Smokin' chronic and drinkin' gin 
 Till we get sick stomached 
 And them suckas ain't gotta like it 
 'Cause ya bitch love it 
 Ima roll it 
 She gon' light it 
 Tell me she in desperate need 
 Of a pilot 
 I told her kick her feet up 
 We gon' go to my crib 
 Soon as I roll this weed up 
 Call some friends of yours 
 And we could all have a smoke out! 
 You ain't gotta hold it too long 
 This is rapper weed 
 Couple hits is all you gon' need 
 In my Versace frames, I'm blazed! 
 Somewhere on the island 
 Smokin' some ray, middle of the day, 
 Drunk dialin' 
 Be surprised by how high a nigga get 
 I'm a different kind of fly, we ain't on the same shit 
 Nigga! 
 I won't land 
 Won't land, won't land (x5) 
 No need to apologize 
 You should know how fly niggas do 
 Only EZ-Widers 
 Been done with them cigarillos fool 
 I been on the road choppin' and killin' them interviews 
 Heard I left a major deal 
 But my paper major still 
 And all of them fans in love with me 
 'Cause I say what's real 
 So I can never give a fuck! 
 How a hater feel 
 But uh, every time they send a driver for me and Will 
 I call her doin' my talkin' on the field 
 At first niggas was tough, 
 They don't wanna be gangstas now 
 Faces of my flow, 
 Yeah they copy and paste my style 
 Wouldn't think I notice it 
 While in my hotel, smokin' wit yo bitch 
 Fool! Haha 
 And this is it, what! 
 Relax your feet, put on some music 
 Roll a zip up 
 And we gon' smoke it till it's gone 
 Ever see me cough? 
 Can't speak for suckas who do 
 Because I'm G'd up! What! 
 Haha! Ah!
