My friends roll Lexus and Benzs 
 And spend ends tremendous like dough's endless 
 Business nigga, from the start was already hot 
 No prob' opening shop, the flow 'ready rock 
 So many trying to knock my hustle 
 Half of y'all ain't even got no hustle 
 I'm into living good, so I bring heat with the flow 
 Just how a nigga should 
 Come between me and my dough, I wish a nigga would 
 Roll O's and cigarillos, my black rim low 
 The way I stack in dough attract nymphos 
 Cats sick though, to impress by how that honey walk 
 Me, I'm tryna come up with some ways to make that money talk 
 Sink or swim, I'm a hungry shark 
 And I want it all, cribs and a foreign car, Aldemar 
 I could be gone tomorrow 
 That's why I grind like it's my last day 
 Hundred fucking roaches in my ash tray 
 Now I know I ain't living right 
 But it feels good 
 Now I know I ain't living right 
 But it feels good 
 Now I know I ain't living right 
 But it feels good 
 Now I know I ain't living right 
 But it feels good 
 My weed kicks like Jet Li flicks 
 Test me kid, slap shots like Gretzky hits 
 The best kept secret, yes he is 
 The cat's out the bag, I puff puff and I pass 
 You dumb fucks and I laugh, motherfucker 
 What you hating for 
 Why you just standing outside, what you waiting for 
 I'm blowing on an eighth or more, touring for my paper boy 
 Before I hit the club I need a blunt or two or three or four 
 Bad bitches thirsty for stars with mad riches 
 Wanna ride with 'em, rest they head on televisions 
 I don't bag bitches, they hop in 
 You just follow and you bag bitches, you're not a pimp 
 I was schooled by the best of them 
 Now they cutting checks for him 
 Ain't gettin' money then it's probably for the rest of them 
 Something like a legend when I quote what I wrote 
 Be in the big cloud from the blunts that I smoke
