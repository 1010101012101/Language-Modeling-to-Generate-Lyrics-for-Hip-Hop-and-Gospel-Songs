Don't you ever leave! 
 Don't you ever go away! 
 I love you, I love you! 
 Yea, I'm begging you, don't you leave, 
 Yea, I'm begging you, don't you go! 
 You've got my heart, you've got my heart! 
 I know I f-cked off, I know I f-cked off! 
 I know I f-cked off! 
 I'm sorry baby! 
 Baby I need you, baby I need you, yeah! 
 I need you baby! 
 But now you're going 
 And I'm forced to deal with your absence, 
 All alone in this madness, 
 All alone on my mattress, 
 Don't know how the hell this happened! 
 You know loving me was a hazard, 
 Outcome of my actions. 
 I wish we could go back, 
 Go back a couple of chapters, 
 Back when there was laughter, 
 Back when we first met, 
 Before we came such a disaster, 
 Before your heart got sharper, 
 Before I forgot how much you meant it. 
 Crazy we don't realize what we have until after. 
 We no longer have it! 
 Don't you ever leave! 
 Don't you ever go away! 
 I love you, I love you! 
 Yea, I'm begging you, don't you leave, 
 Yea, I'm begging you, don't you go! 
 You've got my heart, you've got my heart! 
 You say you're out the door, 
 You're out the door, 
 You're sick and tired can't take no more, 
 Can't take no more! 
 You know the game, 
 And try to help it time and time before, 
 Told me you don't have time to waste it, 
 And hey, you've got to go, you've got to go! 
 Can help on thinking at you when I'm alone, 
 When I'm alone! 
 Try in vain, I call your cell, you don't pick up your phone, 
 Guess that you really mean you meant just what you said, 
 You said just what you meant, 
 Getting all this bread but it don't mean sh-t, 
 Fuck the dough I get, plus the dough I spend, yeah! 
 Don't you ever leave! 
 Don't you ever go away! 
 I love you, I love you! 
 Yea, I'm begging you, don't you leave, 
 Yea, I'm begging you, don't you go! 
 You've got my heart, you've got my heart! 
 Hey superstar, 
 There's a raincloud above my heart 
 And it's only because of you 
 I knew it from the very start 
 Running out of complaints 
 No, no! ?my bodies sedate, 
 Looking at my heart I'll give it away babe 
 And I?ma honor and cherish our blazer 
 Baby? 
 Don't you ever leave! 
 Don't you ever go away! 
 I love you, I love you! 
 Yea, I'm begging you, don't you leave, 
 Yea, I'm begging you, don't you go! 
 You've got my heart, you've got my heart! 
 I know I f-cked off, I know I f-cked off! 
 I know I f-cked off! 
 I'm sorry baby! 
 Baby I need you, baby I need you, yeah! 
 I need you baby! 
 Aww no, no you do 
 Aww no, no you do 
 Yeah 
 I love you!
