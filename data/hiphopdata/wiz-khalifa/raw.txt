Leather on leather nigga, that's raw 
 Take that OG Kush, put it in a RAW 
 Bitch so bad had to hit it raw 
 Ask me how I'm living mane, I'm living raw 
 And I'm smoking good when I'm in my car 
 Niggas want beef, you can get it raw 
 Got these niggas sick, everything is raw 
 Ask me how I'm living mane, I'm living raw 
 Rolling joints like Ice Cube, living raw like payday 
 Get a pound by next Friday, get me gone and I'll be faded 
 And they say I got that raw, yeah I got that Slim Shady 
 They be running for that pure, Yelawolf that MGK 
 I got a house like Scarface's, got a car that win races 
 Got some KK in the jar, know it's raw when you taste it 
 Eating sushi with my broad, order raw when you place it 
 Niggas say that they want war, I'm the wrong one to play with 
 Riding round, blowing pounds, so much loud 
 On a cloud, roll up now, throwing thou's 
 In your town, how it sound 
 Really do some for the game when they started stealing your style 
 Bring the kush, it's going down

 Niggas over doing shit, I just give it to 'em raw 
 Drinking Bombay, straight buying bottles from the bar 
 Book a flight with Miley Cyrus, and we going to the stars 
 Got that ODB 'cause they say they like it raw 
 I got a four fifty engine, in the hood of my car 
 It sound like a dinosaur, you should hear when it roar 
 I let Tuki hit the wax, you was sleeping on the floor 
 Hear a nigga talking shit when we creeping through your door 
 Her homegirl said she wanna leave with her best friend 
 She gon' suck it like a straw 
 I got dollars, I got diamonds, plus I blow it by the onion 
 I'ma give it to them raw
