Wake up, wake up, I don't wanna wake up, wake up. 
 Wake up, wake up, I don't wanna wake up, wake up. 
 Get on straight never switch lane on my job every day 'cause it's hard not to see 
 I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep well it's like a dream 
 I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up 
 I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from 
 I don't wanna wake up from 
 Oh, long days, But I know hard work pays 
 So all the money getting long to 
 And the kush smell strong too, 
 That's that good any chick with me need a bong too 
 One thing I know is go hard young make fake niggas know this 
 Blowing money 'cause you die if you don't live 
 That's how you know I was fly when I wrote this 
 First class tax or maybe I'm the first 'cause it's my first class swag 
 Used to say that I was trippin' so a nigga bought expensive ass bags 
 Get on straight never switch lane on my job every day 'cause it's hard not to see 
 I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep well it's like a dream 
 I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up 
 I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from 
 I don't wanna wake up from 
 Go hard young, go hard let you in the game better play your part 
 Go hard young, go hard and if you win the game as well place smart 
 'Cause I've Seen Niggas Fall Like Paper, Get Money Friends Turn Haters 
 Get Money Major League Turn Major, Get Money White People Turn Neighbors 
 Meet A Girl Teach Her How To Roll Papers, six months three whips all player 
 Run my town like the mayor I run my town bitch I'm like the mayor 
 Get on straight never switch lane on my job every day 'cause it's hard not to see 
 I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep well it's like a dream 
 I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up 
 I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from 
 I don't wanna wake up from 
 I can take you up higher than you ever know 
 Let you dance what you want hear me wax hear me walk let go, hell no 
 Let you lean back inhale smoke 
 2x Chorus: 
 Get on straight never switch lane on my job every day 'cause it's hard not to see 
 I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep well it's like a dream 
 I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from 
 I don't wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from
