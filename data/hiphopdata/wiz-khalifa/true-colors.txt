Taylor Gang, let's get it 
 (Young Money) 
 There's some people coming with me and I know who they are 
 And some that ain't gon' make it and I know who they are 
 And I know they ain't gon' like it but it's quite all right 
 I ain't need no one my whole life, and I done all right 
 I can do bad by myself, these days you never can tell 
 Except the people who been with me and they know who they are 
 Yeah they know my true colors and they see what they are 
 When I pull up in that white on white, they ain't gon' like it 
 And that green inside they hide it, cause that's they true colors 
 When I pull up in that white on white, good God almighty 
 And that green inside my pocket, yeah, cause that's my true colors 
 All I do is smoke weed and get paid 
 That jealousy I can see in they face 
 That green is all that I make, call it fate 
 Or call me perfect with timing 
 Call me crazy, don't call my phone 
 Call me covered with diamonds 
 Call me boss man, young Khalifa man 
 I was on the ground when y'all wasn't sticking to the plan 
 Learn the game just like the back of my hand

 Did everything I stated, I am so innovative 
 All my girls getting faded and all my whips candy painted 
 Call me Nicki M. Ali, these bitches know I'm the greatest 
 'Cause I pull up in the white, pull up with the black, 
 Pull up in the back, pull up with some niggas that be yellin' back 
 Have the hella best fans, hella wet sands, hella jet plans 
 Married to the game they don't need a best man 
 They know I'm a mogul for real

 Can't wait to unveil the Pinkprint cover 
 When I pull up in that white on white, they ain't gon' like it

 Counting faces, spending faces 
 Being faceless, look at they faces
