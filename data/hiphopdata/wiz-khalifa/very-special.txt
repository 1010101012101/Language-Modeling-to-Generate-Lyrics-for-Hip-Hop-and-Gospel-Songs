 Hotel ain't enough, get the crib like we live there 
 Been a player, I ain't fucking up 
 Handle business, my squad chilling 
 Focus on what I'm building, you should probably be fliming 
 What I'm smoking is quality, not for children 
 Half these niggas are wannabe, I came up different 
 Call me in the clutch, perfect timing, never rush 
 Top floor, bring it up, ain't the gang came with us

 Your outfit see through, other bitches dying to be you 
 Nigga wonder why you leaving with me 
 Tired of him, she wanna ride with nigga who sees what she sees 
 Hit me up when you need company 
 If you're ever free, I'm never hard to reach 
 Baby I'm been on this, come to weed I smoke them bombest 
 Hold it down, maybe the gang is what you could be a part of 
 I treat you special cause you very special
