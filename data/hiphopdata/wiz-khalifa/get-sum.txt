 And they don't wanna my team get up there 'n' win it,

 And I ain't never ever gon forget what I been told, 
 And I ain't never ever goin' back to being broke, 
 'Cause FYI I stay on my grind, tryna stop my shine that day will be never ever 
 I started off jus a fan writing like every other kid, grew up to be the man, 
 Paying bills at my mothers crib, everyday I'm hustlin, tryna get us out this situation, 
 Gotta deal with phony show goofy hoes 'n' niggas hatin', mostly all embraces, 
 Small percentage of my city races, instead of doin' good they rather c me catchin cases, 
 The fans love me but I struggle tryna impress the label, 
 An all this gotta feelin' like isway to much up on the table, I'm still smoking outta O, 
 Sum speculations 'cause I'm hardly ever home, easy to say for how suppose to move on, 
 Wen were goin' threw depression an our brother Os gon, was told you gotta go threw hell to get the big thing, 
 An will you feel it can't get worse that's when shit change, obama president, 
 The stealers won the 6 six, so I ought ther tryna I fell like I can do anything
