Ah man yeah they talk, but I can't hear what they say, 'cause I'm flyin' (oh) Yeah, its young khalifa man, yeah they talk but I can't hear what they say, 'cause I'm flying, taylor gang or die, taylor gang or die, yeah they talk, but I can't hear what they say, 'cause I'm flyin', sware they see me, but I'm too many miles away! 'cause I'm flyin' in the air, you all the way down, and I'm flyin' to the sky, I don't touch the ground. I'm flyin' 
 So high I can touch the sky (x10) 
 I'm livin' this movie, movie, you niggas like tevo, 
 See the same things twice, nothing like me though, 
 Man they can dream, flow like a whole key low. 
 Now I got your bitch, try and find me like nemo, 
 Spend a lot of cash, can't front or I might leave broke 
 One live to live, 800 on the weed smoke, 
 Stacks for them guccis like, fuck it I'm'a need those 
 Young superstar, but we feelin' like heroes 
 Top down, and I'm flying like an eagle, 
 Tats on my neck, face, hands like a cholo 
 All about my green, bout my green like cheelo 
 Stars in my face, no scars not chino 
 Smile hard, (hard) swag real mean though 
 Hate enough for, show my ass with my jeans low 
 Started from the bottom, yeah made it like zero 
 Got it on lock now, feeling like nino! 
 Yeah they talk, but I can't hear what they say, 'cause I'm flyin sware they see me but I'm too many miles away, 'cause I'm flying, in the air your all the way down, and I'm flyin, to the sky, I don't touch the ground! I'm flyin 
 So high I can touch the sky (x8) 
 Now I'm south florida, yeah they know me there too, 
 Walkin' with jewels out, showin of my tattoos, 
 Can't say my name right, but they know I'm that dude 
 150 for a plate, niggas eatin fast food 
 Brother out in Lauderdale, cousin down in Van U 
 Me I got a plug, good drugs when I land too 
 Know I'm underage, not much that I can't do 
 You don't talk money, that's why I can't understand you 
 See I'm hot now, going for a grammy though 
 Think this bitch bad, you should see my Miami ho 
 Down in south beach, met her at the Cameo 
 Told her what my life like, took her to the Sagamo 
 100 grand on my neck, just 'cause I gotta glow 
 Never buyin dubs, whole zips what I gotta blow 
 Always dressed to impress you can tell, 
 She love my cologne, that's money that you smell, yeah! 
 Yeah they talk, but I can't hear what they say, 'cause I'm flyin sware they see me but I'm too many miles away, 'cause I'm flying, in the air your all the way down, and I'm flyin, to the sky, I don't touch the ground! I'm flyin so high I can touch the sky (x8)
