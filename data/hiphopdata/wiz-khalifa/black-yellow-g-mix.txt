(Wiz Khalifa) 
 Yeah, Uh huh, you know what it is 
 Black and yellow [x4] 
 Yeah, Uh huh, you know what it is 
 Black and yellow [x4] 
 (Chorus: Wiz Khalifa) 
 Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is 
 Everything I do, I do it big 
 Yeah, uh huh, screaming that's nothing 
 What I pulled off the lot, that's stunting 
 Repping my town when you see me you know everything 
 Black and yellow [x4] 
 I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in 
 Black and yellow [x4] 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Big Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa 
 See on the West Coast I'm the big Chief-a 
 The grim reaper, maybe that bring me that, yellow lack 
 Stealer logo in the back 
 We banging out, that taylor gang 
 Dub to your face baby till ya say my name 
 Don't get your clique served 
 So much Black and Yellow you would think I'm from Pittsburgh 
 Intern, get yearn 
 (Juicy J) 
 I'ma bumble bee lit up like a crima tree 
 Drinking Hennessy, I'm from Tennessee 
 Juicy J make their way on their own two 
 Quarter mill for the Phantom, bitch I own you 
 And that go for every G that I'm f-cking with 
 Black and Yellow bitches all around me, yeah I did 
 In the hearse, gotta get that reimbursed 
 On the pills and that purple pint of Surp 
 And I stay Louie down to the socks 
 Range, and watch, weed and glock 
 Fiends to pop 
 My fans roll with them rubberband knots 
 I'm getting old but them rubber bands not n-gga 
 (T-Pain) 
 Catch me in my Lamborghini 
 (Black and Yellow, black and yellow) 
 I can rock it on the beat or Accapella, accapella 
 Sideways in the turning lane 
 Fire flame I be burning man 
 Teddy Pain bout to hurt the game 
 Took a break for a while I've been learning things 
 I learned how to tell a n-gga f-ck you then 
 (Black and Yellow, black and yellow) 
 All I do is f-cking win 
 I told y'all, told y'all 
 And now I'm on 
 You thought it was over 
 You thought I was gone 
 I'm going in, you don't have to let me, have to let me 
 Back from the dead like I'm Mackavelli, Mackavelli 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 Black and yellow, all black and yellow 
 See me now they treating me like I'm somebody special 
 Smoking on that good know that it's me as soon as they smell it 
 You can chill I'm the one who get it not the one who sell it 
 Grind everyday I'm ballin I can't help it 
 N-ggas on that bullshit my pockets full of Celtics 
 And them n-ggas hating on us give them best wishes 
 In the club you ain't even on the guestlist bitch 
 Sound like you need to get your weight up 
 Go to sleep rich and count another million when I wake up 
 They wondering how I do my thang 2 words, Taylor Gang 
 Remix g-shit 
 The champagnes poured n-gga the weeds lit 
 Lil mama clothes fallin' like the leaves in the fall 
 Ain't worry bout your friends so bring 'em all
