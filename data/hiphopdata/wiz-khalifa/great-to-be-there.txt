Yeah man 
 It's ya boy 
 Young khalifa man 
 Wiz khalifa 
 Whatever the fuck you wanna call me 
 And uh, its '09, star year, yeah 
 So we gone do this like this 
 Taylor gang 
 Heavy hustle and all that 
 Uh um 
 New money, new car, new crib 
 And you gone need luggage cause this nigga's a trip 
 Need to buyer, frequent flyer 
 Loose chains with it, need some pliers, get a grip 
 And me I'm on the suppliers sitting wit 
 Got a blunt rolled 
 Keep me a dime wit sitting bitch 
 I'm mr.space, sign niggas like elroy 
 And my bills big face like hellboy 
 They say I'm guaranteed to blow young steroid 
 And I get it gone, my new home is the airport 
 Wake in a new city and stay 
 Party all night, then go to sleep on a plane 
 Yeah. 
 And it's mill to ice grillz 
 Saying all you wants a picture 
 But nigga I'm tryna chill 
 Lot of speculation since a nigga signed a deal 
 But for all y'all that hold me down for real 
 I wanna thank ya 
 I ain't make your front page or your top ten 
 I'm not a hipster plus I heard rocks in 
 First flight on the way, but till it drops then 
 I'm peroxiding the cut, getting it popping 
 A new year, got a couple shows locked in 
 Couple of important folks doing some talking 
 I'm with the stars and niggas who go hard 
 Getting chavo 
 Niggas duckin' from rosado 
 Checking battery life now, charging my iphone 
 I do it big, you just the shit in your time zone 
 I switch those like clothes 
 Charm like a computer with a virus whos mind froze 
 Whoa 
 I get alot of whole hate, whole lot of hoes 
 Spend a whole lot of cake on a prod of clothes 
 When you mention my name, they ain't gotta know 
 This for thinking they ought of know 
 I wanna thank ya
