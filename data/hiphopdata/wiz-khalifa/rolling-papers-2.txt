Nigga, my motherfucker's life depends on this shit 
 Do this shit for my son 
 Turn me up 
 So I can hear myself a little more in the headphones 
 Came from the bottom, started this out with nothing 
 Turned the fam in my squad, and turn this thing into something 
 I grab a cone and I stuff it, never gonna get enough 
 Depending on how it's going, we only gonna get tougher 
 I done seen people suffers, hate turned into love 
 Lost some people to get here 
 But they watching us from up above 
 On the road, hardly ever home 
 And money caught one in the dome 
 Now its hard to even pick up my phone 
 Leave me alone, I'll be in my zone 
 I'm getting grown but not too grown to let my feelings show 
 Anything you want, you can get, you gotta build it tho 
 I blew up quick and lost some shit 
 But now I'm dealing those 
 There's consequences to every decisions 
 Good or wrong, just do the best with time you're given (?) strong 
 Give your all 'cause a man gon' be a man 
 And do what he gotta do 
 Baby, this is rolling papers two 
 (This is rolling papers two) 
 (This is rolling papers two) 
 Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it 
 When it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it 
 (Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it 
 When it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it) 
 Yeah, all of the fame just comes with the game 
 It's a gift and the curse when everybody know your name 
 How do you make a million dollars and stay same 
 How do you make a hundred millions and still sane 
 You got the money, the clothes, the cars, the girls 
 Trying to do better, but all the shit in the world 
 Something regular would you prefer? 
 But it's cool, it's too much pressure, you think you should curve 
 On the verge, packing up and going back to where I come from 
 Tired of these rappers, I only run in the lane once 
 Tired of all these girls, we all fucking the same one 
 I ain't giving chances no more, I already gave one 
 Getting money, you better save some 
 Don't be afraid to make mistakes 'cause you gotta make some 
 It takes time, but a man gon be a man and do what he gotta do 
 Baby, this is rolling papers two 
 (This is rolling papers two) 
 (This is rolling papers two) 
 Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it 
 When it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it 
 (Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it 
 When it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it) 
 No turning back, I'm learning that 
 If you ever show someone love, you deserves it back 
 If you got a ounces of paper, you should burn it back 
 And if you ever do takes a loss, you can earn it back 
 Never slack, never overreact, let your money stack 
 Look at where you're going and where you at 
 You gon get there if you work hard 
 When you make it, you'll get exactly what you work for 
 I want more, couple cars in my garage 
 And mansions with marble floors 
 Above it all, open my doors 
 Couple plaques on the wall 
 Hoop court where my friends could ball 
 It may sounds strange but Imma need it all 
 When I spend some afar, I hit the road when I get the car 
 Got some family members that I don't see at all 
 It pays off 'cause a man gon be a man and do what he gotta do 
 Baby, this is rolling papers two 
 (This is rolling papers two) 
 (This is rolling papers two) 
 Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it 
 When it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it 
 (Imma roll it, roll it, Imma light it, light it 
 When it's time to make a change, I ain't gonna fight it, fight it)
