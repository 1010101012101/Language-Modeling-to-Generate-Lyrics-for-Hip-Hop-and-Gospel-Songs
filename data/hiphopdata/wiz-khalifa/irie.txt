I wake up and roll some dank up with my niggas 
 I got on the phone and caught up with some bitches 
 I got dressed, I mixed the Tisa with Versace 
 I smoked a joint and took a BR, now I'm irie 
 I'm irie, I'm irie, I'm irie 
 I'm irie, yeah, I'm irie 
 I'm irie 
 When I'm in Brooklyn I send runners to bodegas 
 Don't bring no dutchie back homie, I prefer papers, I prefer papers 
 And I got love for the Nets but it's still Lakers 
 I turn my music up, fuck my neighbors 
 I hit JFK, I'm going back to Cali 
 I got some OG Kush from San Fernando Valley 
 My nigga Beezy on the way from 'County 
 We keep supporting, damn it, we from grass valley 
 I got a bad bitch riding shotgun with the shotgun 
 Pocket full of money and some condoms 
 I'mma drop your bitch back off when I'm done 
 Hope you make your bitch get in the shower 
 That's your bitch, she my bitch, too 
 She let the homie in, too 
 Niggas be cuffin' while their bitches be fuckin' 
 My nigga, that ain't nothing new 
 I'm the nigga that your bitch come to 
 When she wanna cheat on you 
 I hella be tripping, too, but I got my bitches in you 
 I wake up and roll some dank up with my niggas 
 I got on the phone and caught up with some bitches 
 I got dressed, I mixed the Tisa with Versace 
 I smoked a joint and took a BR, now I'm irie 
 I'm irie, I'm irie, I'm irie 
 I'm irie, yeah, I'm irie 
 I'm irie 
 It's Taylor Gang, I get so high that it's irrational 
 When I pull up in first class, it's international 
 I know some ratchet bitches and they rep the North side 
 We ain't smoking on that pack unless it's certified 
 Glowing by the zone, nigga, worth the grown 
 Smoking on that strong, give me dome while I'm on the phone 
 Take you to my home where we zip it up and pack it 
 Roll them joints up big as fuck, they tell me smell my ' 
 This young boy gonna live it up 
 Pass the loud, you'd think that I smoke flavors 
 No bitches in the hood that don't smoke papers 
 Ain't tryina heard 'bout what you mean because I got it 
 It's on the plane 'cause I can't leave a trip without it 
 Claim you smoke more weed than me, I really doubt it 
 If she wake up and roll a joint that mean she 'bout it 
 And rest in peace, go to my nigga right 
 Now we call it KK and we smoke it all day 
 Straight to the face, fuck what the police say 
 I wake up and roll some dank up with my niggas 
 I got on the phone and caught up with some bitches 
 I got dressed, I mixed the Tisa with Versace 
 I smoked a joint and took a BR, now I'm irie 
 I'm irie, I'm irie, I'm irie 
 I'm irie, yeah, I'm irie 
 I'm irie
