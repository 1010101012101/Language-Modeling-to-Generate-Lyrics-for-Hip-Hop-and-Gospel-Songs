I be rollin' 
 Riden 
 Flow so fly I be so so high 
 She say I'm that guy you wanna ride with 
 Like my car get inside it 
 U excited 
 I don't blame you 
 Everywhere I go all them hoes act the same too 
 I don't wanna date you 
 I just wanna take you home 'n' do somethin' grown folks can relate too 
 Bitch I'ma play you 
 I would hate to 
 But if you stay cool we should be straight boo 
 Bitch I'ma straight fool 
 No I can't lie 
 Don't let a day go bye where I ain't high 
 Pump ur brake lights lemme slow it down 
 Know who I is 'n' how is bout to go down 
 U wanna roll now 
 We'll just ride out 
 Right now I'll show you what I'm bout 
 Tryna front when you see me in the club bitch you no who I am

 Gettin' weeded with a pocket full of dubs I bet you no who I am

 Didn't notice it but now ur goin' nuts cause you no who I am

 Bottles of patron good green in my cigar 
 See you in ur girl watchin me 'n' my niggas

 Just lettin me come round now she a buss down 
 Feelin' my convo
