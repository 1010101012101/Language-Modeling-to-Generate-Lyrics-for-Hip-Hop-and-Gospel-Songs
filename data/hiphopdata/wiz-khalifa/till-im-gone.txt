I grew tired of the same, then one night 
 Packed my things, told the one I love 
 I'll be back one day 
 Through the fight, through the pain 
 Booked a flight, took a plane 
 Told her not to cry 
 I'll be back one day 
 Been dreaming this since I was young 
 So baby girl I'll be going till I'm gone (gone) 
 Till I'm gone (gone) 
 Till I'm gone (gone) 
 I buy time in switzerland 
 I drive round in monaco 
 I shook hands with royalty 
 I make songs that monarchs know 
 Ti ti ti la so fa? 
 Mi mi mi ra do? 
 Call me aloe blacc 'cause I need that dollar yo 
 Ha ha 
 Hic-hic-hiccup 
 Blame it on the liquor 
 I came through like a stick up 
 Now I'm ballin' like a kick up 
 I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of nip tuck 
 And yes I am the best man, I'm so sorry 'bout the mix up 
 Come out and play, pour out another bottle 
 Let's do it all today and worry 'bout it all tomorrow 
 I do it for the thrill 
 You know I love the rush 
 And once you get me going I can never get enough 
 I grew tired of the same, then one night 
 Packed my things, told the one I love 
 I'll be back one day 
 Through the fight, through the pain 
 Booked a flight, took a plane 
 Told her not to cry 
 I'll be back one day 
 Been dreaming this since I was young 
 So baby girl I'll be going till I'm gone (gone) 
 Till I'm gone (gone) 
 Till I'm gone 
 But I won't be gone for too long 
 In Amsterdam, and Milan 
 Just came off Aussie tour 
 You've never seen this thing before? 
 I'm the one like 2 plus 3 
 M-m-m-minus four 
 Fe-fe-fe-fi-fo-fum 
 Every time that I climb a stalk 
 Yeah, yeah, I'm honest I landed in a rocket 
 With a crown inside my watch and silver peace sign on my bonnet 
 You don't need a thermometer to tell you who's the hottest 
 Ip dip do muthafucker you are not it 
 Come out and play, pour out another bottle 
 Let's do it all today and worry 'bout it all tomorrow 
 I do it for the thrill 
 You know I love the rush 
 And once you get me going I can never get enough 
 OK I'm in it, I'm in it to the finish 
 I keep them bottles coming like my card ain't got no limit 
 Got some friends that playing football 
 And some friends that playing cricket 
 And a mistress that is fine like a fucking parking ticket 
 Ha ha 
 I said I'm in it, I'm in it till the finish 
 I keep them bottles coming till there ain't nothing in it 
 I'm like Mario on mushrooms 
 I'm like Popeye on some spinach 
 We gon' keep it coming till I no speaka no English 
 Ah
