Uh, uh, yeah bitch, ha, ha 
 That's what I like to call my type of shit 
 Yeah, forward progression, niggas got it backwards 
 I'm relevant but nothin' like you other rappers 
 You see I fuck with trap niggas 
 Because really, I'm the only one rappin', get it how you live 
 Survival of the fittest you should know the code 
 All I got is what I give until they overload 
 Nigga, I'm the shit overflowed 
 And I grab a blunt split it like a chromosome 
 Uh, I'll have it where you're bitch ain't phonin' home 
 We done blown the whole oak gettin' our stoner on 
 Ain't gotta say shit, I know you don't 
 See my chain, make the same face from Home Alone 
 All this good weed that I'm puffin' 
 Got me feelin' like there ain't a place I can't go 
 Ain't a thing I won't do 
 And I'm awake so I guess my dream's come true 
 And the game gave me a feelin' that no one can take away from me 
 I said no one can take away from me 
 On the road doin' shows, oh, no one can take away from me 
 I get a feelin' that no one can take away 
 Uh, down to take a trip my nigga, what's the ticket hittin' for? 
 I got some hoes that wanna roll too, ha, ha 
 And if you wanna see what it's like to be just the team 
 And tired of the background so you make your own scene 
 I'll hit you up when I roll through 
 Yeah, California weed keep ya pissed off in your mind state 
 Hard to get it on it so my niggas boost the crime rate 
 It's obvious I'm ghetto so they love me like I'm Kid Rock 
 Try your luck with what's around my neck and get ya wig chopped 
 Fuckin' with I can get you so much cash or nowhere fast 
 I got your bitch in awe, she never flown first class 
 Or had the driver get her bags 
 And the game gave me a feelin' that no one can take away from me 
 I said no one can take away from me 
 On the road doin' shows, oh, no one can take away from me 
 I get a feelin' that no one can take away
