This the top, oh yeah, the tippy 
 It's young Khalifa man 
 I see it clearly, the money that is 
 Oh y?all n-ggas ain't in the way 
 Keep doing what you doing 
 See right through you 
 Got me drinking out the bottle 
 Living for today ain't thinking about tomorrow 
 N-ggas fake I can see it with my eyes closed 
 In desperate need of a leader so they follow 
 And me I only see chavo 
 I roll up bleezy and hit it like a high note 
 My skin tough as a rhinos 
 So keep hating I keep dating these dime hoes 
 Diamonds on my neck, got diamonds on my chain 
 Yeah, city or your state, catch me mobbin with my gang 
 N-gga violate they won't hesitate to aim 
 And I got enough change to afford the price of fame 
 I'm like poision to y'all lames, or drugs or prescriptions 
 Turn my music on get a buzz when you listening 
 You want them then pay for em 
 And n-ggas talk fly but I'm space gone 
 Up outta of here 
 I never sleep but I got big dreams 
 Lil nigga I do big things 
 You know its everything that it seems 
 They say my life is like the big screen (big screen) 
 I fill my bank with every 16 
 My money straight and my bitch mean 
 You should wait and get a ticket please 
 They say my life's like the big screen (big screen) 
 I feel like a desperado, on the track I just kick it like rilo? 
 See me on the TV yeah, I be in grind mode 
 But please believe I'm in the streets like pot holes 
 Antonio no guitar though, only instrumental is that pistol 
 Need a right hand so I f-cks with chevy 
 And underneath the wings so I hustle heavy 
 Tatted on my face, chest, neck, hand, stomach 
 Been on that paper chase since that cake start running 
 Never touched the brick, I ain't never slung no drugs 
 Still get a feeling when I see that gold car coming 
 Got my pops old soul, I'm an 80's baby 
 Moms smoke hella weed I'm a wavy baby 
 You Mr Me Too, and you need fuel man 
 You n-ggas see-through, air 
 I never sleep but I got big dreams 
 Lil nigga I do big things 
 You know its everything that it seems 
 They say my life is like the big screen (big screen) 
 I fill my bank with every 16 
 My money straight and my bitch mean 
 You should wait and get a ticket please 
 They say my life's like the big screen (big screen)
