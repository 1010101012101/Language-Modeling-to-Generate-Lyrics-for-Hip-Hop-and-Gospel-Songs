(Chorus - Wiz Khalifa) 
 I bought a whole O to smoke 
 I'm riding high 
 My niggas with me, they down to ride 
 I got my change up, they looking like they surprised 
 Got niggas hating on me hard because my paper right 
 Money from the floor, way up to the sky 
 Now they want to know, and they wonder why 
 I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly 
 I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide 
 And I'm killing them, it's homicide 
 I'm killing them, it's homicide 
 I got my change up, they looking like they surprised 
 Got niggas hating on me hard because my paper right 
 But I'm killing them, it's homicide 
 I'm killing them, it's homicide 
 I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly 
 I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide 
 I'm killing them 
 (Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa) 
 First forty eight, first forty eight 
 Took out fifty racks and blew the first forty eight 
 I ain't worried about spending bread because I got more to make 
 Soon as they see that Maserati they gone surely hate 
 Hundred for a show, can you afford a date? 
 And that's just one show, imagine what my tour gone make 
 Police ran up on my tour bus 
 But hey my niggas, more money, more problems, more lawyers on the case 
 Niggas was at the Grammys 
 I was at the crib working 
 Heard they little diss, but I'm just being the big person 
 Never been trained, still my aim near perfect 
 Everything I spits murder, bow 
 (Verse 2 - Chevy Woods) 
 With black on black cars coming through 
 Presidential shit, tints on the whip 
 So dark can't see who riding in that bitch 
 Suits and ties no questions why 
 Somebody get a box ready for these guys 
 No four door, had the coupe that ride 
 That eagle right here if you want to feel fly 
 No games though, no names spoke 
 This crack right here, cocaine flow 
 I don't know what you doing but I'm paid bro 
 Yeah I pitch that .9 like Pedro 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 Stuck in the car with my nigga I'm ready to ride 
 We on our way to the top, watch that paper rise 
 (Chevy Woods) 
 Keep telling everybody what you going to do 
 Middle finger like fuck what you going through 
 All I know is that money that I'm going to 
 And them gang gang boys want to bone you 
 Like what's up 'cause I told you 
 Just money in the pocket, fold you 
 T-A-Y-L-O-R G-A-N-G Gang
