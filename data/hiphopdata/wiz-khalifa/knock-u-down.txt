Pop champagne, roll some weed up 
 We in a slow game, I brung the speed up 
 High octane, hella inked up 
 Bird or plane, u prolly seen us 
 Made a lil change, but it's all good 
 Neva throw it in your face I'm from a small Hooood 
 Best dressed lyk a star should, beat on so I could hardly see y'all 
 We Are, Some Taylor Gang fukkin bosses 
 And I live everyday not caring wat it costest 
 Pop more bands, Cop more cloths, 
 Drive fast cars, Fuck bad hoes 
 I fly in circles you non workers in dirt last 
 Readin tweets and fallin' asleep in first class 
 Might of heard my song but alot of y'all ain't know the kid 
 So I took over the net lyk Hova did 
 And set my goals where the solar is 
 Now my swag on polar bear 
 And you here so pretend ya man don't even exist 
 And get your lips wet lyk a lisp 
 I'm just lyk a pimp, some dislike from them 
 But I'm a big fish, u just Tiger Shrimp 
 Flirted wit fame but at night I dream of success 
 If you sleepin' on me then you gettin' good rest 
 Yes 
 Cause wen niggas ask who hot if it ain't Drizzy then they talkin' 'bout me 
 Okay 
 Hahaa
