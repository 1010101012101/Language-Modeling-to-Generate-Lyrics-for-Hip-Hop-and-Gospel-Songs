My bad, I came and fell straight asleep 
 Tired as a mo' fucker 
 (Uh) 
 It was 2009 
 And I was just gettin' home off tour 
 Doin' hella shows for my fans 
 And I could tell that everybody want more 
 Ain't ever wait for nobody 
 We kicked through that front door 
 And always did our own thing 
 Can't tell you niggas wanna front for 
 We bought cones and stuffed more 
 Past girls, you cuffed yours 
 Spent nights on the airplane goin' too hard, like what for? 
 And all I did was make time 
 But I ain't take enough for myself 
 Just doin' shit for everybody else 
 I ain't hardly even by myself 
 Family time is slowed down 
 'Cause they want me to burn out 
 Seen the end of this movie 
 They don't know how it turns out 
 Say they all gon' still love me if I don't make another hit song 
 If I don't take time to embrace it, what's the point of doin' this for? 
 I'm packin' up my bags 
 Book a night, another hotel 
 It's a lot that could go down 
 So I'm hopin' everything goes well 
 Came in to this game 
 Givin' rules to you lames 
 Be the one that's holding you down 
 Tryna count you out, it's a shame 
 And that's fucked up 
 But as long as I got my family and my niggas everything'll be okay 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 And that's fucked up 
 But as long as I got my family and my niggas everything'll be okay 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 It was 2014 
 And I was 'bout to go world tourin' 
 You was all up in my face 
 Sayin' that you want more 
 And I was gettin' tired 
 Of frontin' for the public 
 Sayin' I could do without it 
 But you seem like you love it 
 I remember all of the subjects 
 That we would argue 'bout day and night 
 Do the best that I can 
 No matter what, I can make it right 
 When you said you felt single 
 I remember like it was yesterday 
 How the fuck you hold me down 
 When you ain't take my last name 
 I tried hard to move past things 
 Came home, made shit change 
 Had to make a hard decision, let you go, it's time to do what's best for me 
 We went to Colorado, we was there for your friends' wedding 
 I was tryin' to hold it together 
 But I felt like we were ending 
 I remember the beginning 
 But this ain't nowhere close to that 
 Seen some shit you didn't like 
 Said some shit that wasn't facts 
 Never thought 'bout gettin' back 
 By puttin' your business out 
 In the end you made it seem like I ain't the one who held you down 
 And that's fucked up 
 But as long as I got my family and my niggas everything'll be okay 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 And that's fucked up 
 But as long as I got my family and my niggas everything'll be okay 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 We ain't hurtin' no mo', we ain't fighting no mo' 
 Cause everything, cause everything is okay 
 We ain't hurtin' no mo' (I swear), we ain't fighting no mo' (no) 
 Cause everything, cause everything is okay 
 We ain't hurtin' no mo' (we ain't gotta hurt no more, bro), we ain't fighting no mo' 
 Cause everything, cause everything is okay 
 We ain't hurtin' no mo' (no), we ain't fighting no mo' (nah) 
 Cause everything, cause everything is okay 
 Okay, okay, I'm a be okay 
 Okay, okay, I'm a be okay 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 Okay, okay, I'm a be okay 
 Okay, okay, I'm a be okay 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 It was 2017 
 The day before my son birthday 
 The week before my mom birthday 
 That's the day you passed away 
 Can't feel too bad because I know I see you again one day 
 But right now I can't help but feel this pain 
 And that's fucked up 
 But as long as I got my family and my niggas everything'll be okay 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 And that's fucked up 
 But as long as I got my family and my niggas everything'll be okay 
 (Be okay, be okay) 
 (Be okay, be okay)
