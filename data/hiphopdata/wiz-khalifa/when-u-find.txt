Damn 
 Don't 
 Don't 
 Damn 
 Yeah 
 Don't leave 'cause you're my oxygen 
 Without you I won't breathe 
 You're everything I want, need 
 For you I'll wear my heart on this short sleeve 
 I know something need changin' 
 That takes time, I need more, please 
 Say I ain't do everything I coulda done 
 Like the shit I did ain't good enough 
 Your friends said they been with a luf 
 Ain't do you right so you head to the left 
 I can't say that I blame you 
 Never thought it would be this painful 
 People do it everyday 
 I can Change too 
 But dealin' with the heartbreak is what she can't do 
 True and that's hpow real gets 
 Whatch ya feel ain't easy to deal with 
 When you find the girl you love has gone 
 You ask yourself why life must go on 
 You think alot about what she said 
 Deep inside you pray He'll bring her back someday 
 Don't go, how to live my life without you 
 I just don't know 
 Whatch ya feel in this relationship 
 It's not that it can't it just won't grow 
 I say I love you, you say it don't show 
 Fuck the money ad the gifts don't count 
 What about the smaller things you needed 
 And why the fuck you had to leave before I seen it 
 Damn I need you your love like a weed stick 
 Bein' without you is like Kathy no Regis 
 I kept secrets I couldn't apologize enough times for messin' with that freak bitch 
 But I can tell you leavin' 
 Like I said I can't blame you the least bit 
 Kinds shame is times is changin' 
 Best friends become strangers 
 That's how it is
