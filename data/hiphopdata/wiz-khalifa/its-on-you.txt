Everybody wants someone to blame 
 Taking losses that's part of the game 
 Ain't forgetting how far that we came, hey 
 Everybody wants someone to blame 
 Taking losses that's part of the game 
 Ain't forgetting how far that we came, hey 
 Uh, if you made for the top, then you gon' make it to the top 
 And you gon' keep goin' because the game don't stop 
 If you always stay ten toes you ain't gon' flop 
 Lot of doors will get closed but ain't gon' lock 
 Things, they change it's a newer game 
 Niggas who talk but won't do the same 
 Plus they all broke, I see through the fame 
 And fasten yourself like you do a change 
 Next year is you gon' be on private planes 
 And you can blame anyone 
 It's on you, you, you 
 Don't give in, keep on goin' 
 And you can blame anyone 
 It's on you, you, you 
 Don't give in, keep on goin' 
 And later Miami, Atlanta to Houston, New York 
 Do what you gotta do for now it makes you feel important 
 You could be in the room and bosses won't even absorb it 
 Cause you too busy livin' out what you see in the portrait 
 All the things you involve with 
 Are just the smallest problems 
 I ain't gon' need the pardon 
 And I'm just being honest 
 You need to take some time to yourself and think about it 
 Grow up, you're being childish 
 I wanna see you balance 
 Don't think you're being challenged 
 And you can blame anyone 
 It's on you, you, you 
 Don't give in, keep on goin' 
 And you can blame anyone 
 It's on you, you, you 
 Don't give in, keep on goin' 
 Everybody wants someone to blame 
 Taking losses that's part of the game 
 Ain't forgetting how far that we came, hey 
 Everybody wants someone to blame
