Yeah 
 Its Wiz Khalifa man 
 It's that 412 
 I got that Pittsburgh sound 
 Around these parts 
 I'm known as the youngest in charge 
 My shit bang out the trunk of your car 
 It's the cities known rap spitta 
 Semi blown clack niggas 
 Skin and bones but really known as that nigga 
 I'm known to chase the bucks 
 Grind to get my paper up 
 In the studio writin' rhymes till the paper crunch 
 I'm not the type that you would call 'em a thug 
 But I'm a hustler it's all in my blood 
 So if it's all for the cheese then I'm in it 
 My screws kinda loose so I ease to the finish 
 I hop up in the coupe feel the breeze while I'm in it 
 Blowin' smoke up out the roof from the trees that I'm spliffin' 
 Youngin' got the game on lock 
 I'm on top it's a shame y'all not 
 You a lame put your brain on pot 
 Leave you wet like the rain y'all drop 
 I'm gon' rock and I ain't gon' stop, nigga 
 Who's the kid spittin' flames 
 Changin' the game 
 His name, its wiz khalifa man 
 From the home of the brick 
 Where they know for the cake 
 The place, that steel city damn 
 I got that Pittsburgh sound 
 And Imma always hold pittsburgh down 
 Its Wiz Khalifa man 
 You can't tell by now 
 Pittsburgh Imma swell my town 
 That steel city damn 
 Roll rubber you don't know who you dealin' with 
 Oh so innocent but flows so billigant 
 My spit games like a 44 killin' shit 
 Know your man warm but the young ball killin' shit 
 Realist shit and your main wife dig me 
 Game try and hit me 
 Kick game like 50 cent 
 Niggas wanna play games I quickly 
 Mob with a squad that will bang y'all wit' me 
 And they want the kid still hurtin' 
 Hundred niggas wit hammers 
 Yeah that's wat I call a steal curtain 
 I handle my time and still work it 
 Put in work couple mil. worth in 
 And I'm from Pittsburgh where the green 
 And the eatin' is good 
 Where the fiends do everything in the hood 
 Everyday is like a war so my soldiers ride fatiguesin the hood 
 And we gettin' all the green like we should 
 You know yeah
