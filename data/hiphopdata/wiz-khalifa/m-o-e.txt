Wake up in the morning feeling so damn good 
 I made music so good today 
 Me and my niggas bout to kick it with some bitches 
 And you know we bout to roll some trees 
 I'm feelin' it, you feelin' it 
 I'm feelin' it, you feelin' it 
 M.o.e., m.o.e. 
 Music over everything 
 M.o.e., m.o.e. 
 Music over everything 
 M.o.e., m.o.e. 
 Music over everything 
 M.o.e., m.o.e. 
 Music over everything 
 Taking my time to perfect the beats 
 And I still got love for the streets 
 Keen gold chains and my nigga Wiz Khalif 
 Got trip in a drink, couple bad bitches, they just want VIP 
 You a playa fo real? Don't bring around me 
 Got girls left up in the backseat 
 Runnin' like attract me, that's me, 
 Leather on the 6th speed 
 Love it when she got her own shit together 
 Got shit to lose, then she with whatever 
 Always out of town, she my distant lover 
 Only pull in driveways with tints and better 
 Gold rims, we ghetto, on the chase for cheddar 
 From a jet runway, I can land wherever 
 Make more in a day than your salary 
 Nigga why you mad at me? Talk cheap 
 I don't lose sleep, man I 
 Wake up in the morning feeling so damn good 
 I made music so good today 
 Me and my niggas bout to kick it with some bitches 
 And you know we bout to roll some trees 
 I'm feelin' it, you feelin' it 
 I'm feelin' it, you feelin' it 
 I roll up that Mary J, my favorite song playin' 
 My clothes from the runway, my kush come from the land 
 You's a baller or a hustler then you know what I'm sayin' 
 Them haters they talkin', hear 'em talk, I don't care 
 I'm rollin', probably do a 95, smoking getting mighty high 
 Rolling weed since '99, smoke so much I'll probably fly 
 If I don't smoke I'll probably die 
 I'm holding, gripping on the steering wheel, listening to my favorite jam 
 Ridin' through Hollywood, I'm feeling like the fuckin' man 
 Hundred grand to see me, kinda fore I go to sleep 
 That's why I 
 Wake up in the morning feeling so damn good 
 I made music so good today 
 Me and my niggas bout to kick it with some bitches 
 And you know we bout to roll some trees 
 I'm feelin' it, you feelin' it 
 I'm feelin' it, you feelin' it 
 Drive fast till I'm out of gas 
 Getting money like this, can't look back 
 She a one night stand, tryna make it last 
 But I be out of town soon as I hit that 
 Fifteen stacks runways, living lavish, big carrots 
 You ain't getting money like that 
 I put rhymes on the beat, T-Rawws on the feet 
 Don't hate me 'cause I'm where you wanna be 
 I do mostly what the minimum do 
 So my girls might be yours times 22 
 Ride 22 2's and I chunk up the deuce 
 Everything great like a nigga Babe Ruth 
 Translucent roof, but her dress seem through 
 She just tryna make it 
 Guess you gotta do what you gotta do 
 Shit I ain't gonna judge you 
 But don't expect me to love you, feelin' it?
