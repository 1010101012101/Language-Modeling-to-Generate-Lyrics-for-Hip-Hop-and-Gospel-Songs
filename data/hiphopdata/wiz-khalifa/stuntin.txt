Yeah, y'all already know, 
 When I walk the f-ck back 
 You can't act like that ain't the flyest thing you ever seen in your whole entire muthaf-ckin sorry a-s life 
 Can't say I'm not the freshest n-gga that you ever seen 
 Keep a couple grand nothin' less in my jeans 
 That's probably why yo b-tch keep ringin' my phone 
 When I pull up she can't leave me alone 
 Lil' homie I grind (I grind) 
 No sleep (sleep) 
 I'm good in the hood everybody know me (know me) 
 I got my truck on blast 
 Hear me when I roll through 
 Stuntin' like a young n-gga supposed to 
 Stunt'n like I'm supposed to 
 Ridin' with my hat cocked 
 Smokin' something good 3 blunts and I'm smacked out 
 All city on smash, game on padlock 
 26 inch rims, chrome 'em on the matchbox 
 6 bad hoes man I can't choose one 
 3 cell phones I just can't use one 
 You see how often I spit 
 You just off bread hun 
 This the sh-t they can't do young 
 Talk fly if you look 'em in the air 
 Too young, you wonder where I got these Gucci pair of shoes from 
 A lot of y'all mad 
 To me it's just funny 
 I see why y'all hatin' man and the hoes just love me 
 And you know I'm gettin' shhh 
 F-ck it I ain't gotta say it 
 The tab taken care of n-gga I ain't gotta pay it 
 Yeah, I'm all day with it, year round 
 I bet if you was here now 
 Can't say I'm not the freshest n-gga that you ever seen 
 Keep a couple grand nothin' less in my jeans 
 That's probably why yo b-tch keep ringin' my phone 
 When I pull up she can't leave me alone 
 Lil' homie I grind (I grind) 
 No sleep (sleep) 
 I'm good in the hood everybody know me (know me) 
 I got my truck on blast 
 Hear me when I roll through 
 Stuntin' like a young n-gga supposed to 
 Got a fat knot, blunt rolled up 
 Me I ride clean, neck froze up 
 Bad b-tch on the side 
 My n-ggas all rich 
 Foreign whips what they drive 
 Yeah, I smell like Gucci and big money too 
 See them guys with me? they gettin' money too 
 Ride 22's and got heat so 
 If a n-gga try me you a big prob you runnin' into 
 I smoke a lot need blunt or 2 
 At a time whole pounds I be runnin' through 
 Yeah, I got a dime b-tch coming through 
 'Cause I pimp like I'm supoosed to 
 Wonder how I get it like this, I could show you 
 But it's all leather in the whip when I roll through 
 This year I'm a get sh-t cleared 
 Take a look at this kid 
 Can't say I'm not the freshest n-gga that you ever seen 
 Keep a couple grand nothin' less in my jeans 
 That's probably why yo b-tch keep ringin' my phone 
 When I pull up she can't leave me alone 
 Lil' homie I grind (I grind) 
 No sleep (sleep) 
 I'm good in the hood everybody know me (know me) 
 I got my truck on blast 
 Hear me when I roll through 
 Stuntin' like a young n-gga supposed to
