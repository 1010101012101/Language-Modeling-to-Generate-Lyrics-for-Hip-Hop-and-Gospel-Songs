(Puffin) Uh huh 
 Sledgerin 
 Uh 
 Look nigga I'm the rawest, the mo'fuckin' animal 
 Want war? One phone call is how I handle you (whew) 
 On the grind, you pussy nigga's hate 
 Bitch I'm out in different states, politic, and gettin' cake. 
 Fill my lungs with the best weed, pockets with them doller signs. 
 Run with them niggas holdin' glocks like its columbine (pop, pop, pop) 
 I'm a star, ain't a choice hoe I gotta shine 
 Far as Pittsburg, I'm the voice so I gotta rhyme. 
 Grind all the time ever since the 1st day 
 Now I'm gettin' cake like every day became my birthday 
 Something like a earthquake, the way this shit drop 
 I be at the tip top posted with a big knot 
 You didn't know hoe you sit at home and just watch 
 Less then haters, stone cold spectators 
 Same lame's turn out to be investigators 
 No where near comfortable need extra paper. 
 Got the city on smash, the streets on lock 
 100 real niggas with their heats on cock 
 Got my pockets on swol still need more gwap. 
 Plus the hood says they love to hear the young boy talk 
 Ay ay 
 The jeans spent about a buck 45 on them 
 If He trick the team, buck 45's on him. 
 When we hit the scene, the club hoes just pile on him 
 You scrubs show them groupies love, I just style on them.
