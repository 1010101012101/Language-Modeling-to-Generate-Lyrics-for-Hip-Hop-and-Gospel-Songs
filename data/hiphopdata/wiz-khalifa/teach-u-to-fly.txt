Hey, don't trip... bitch 
 Matter fact I got somethin' you can trip on 
 Gonna need your expensive luggage for this one 
 I might be with my girl 
 But you can bring your girls too 
 Now we can do all the kinky things you 
 Think you ain't supposed to 
 I'll take you out this world 
 And we can get commercial 
 See ima need privacy its obvious you ain't learn 
 So, I'll teach you to fly 
 I can teach you to fly 
 I can teach you to fly 
 I can teach you to fly 
 I can teach you to fly 
 I can teach you to fly 
 I can teach you to fly

 And she dug my chain 
 Love my swag I does my thang 
 Love my slang, talk just like me 
 Say she proud to be taylor gang (taylor gang?) 
 Man I'm paid 
 Tell the waitress bring more champagne 
 I done made what you tryin' to get 
 And my style is sick 'cause I'm taylor made 
 Got no time to waste, see it's like were in a race 
 All the bitches in this club would die to take your place 
 They call me mr space, and I can let you taste 
 But you been on the ground for so long 
 I might be with my girl 
 But you can bring your girls too 
 Now we can do all the kinky things you 
 Think you ain't supposed to 
 I'll take you out this world 
 And we can get commercial 
 See ima need privacy its obvious you ain't learn 
 So, I'll teach you to fly 
 I can teach you to fly 
 I can teach you to fly 
 I can teach you to fly 
 I can teach you to fly 
 I can teach you to fly 
 I can teach you to fly
