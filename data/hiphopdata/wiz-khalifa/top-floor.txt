Started out slow 
 Cause no matter how much she gets she wants more 
 Girl now we on the top floor 
 Holding on tight, you and I go 
 Can you feel it in? 
 Can you feel it in? 
 Feel it in? 
 Uh, first class help you in the game like a free throw 
 Fill my bank up with cash, my glass with Clicquot 
 You ain't gotta tell your friends what we talk about or the places that we go 
 You mine for the night, your man tryin' repo, uh 
 Work nights never sleep so you think she got no job 
 Go to school during the week, on the weekend we go hard 
 Live so large, let you go tear down the mall like it's your car 
 It's no problem, go ahead and sing it girl, this is your song 
 Started out slow 
 Cause no matter how much she gets she wants more 
 Girl now we on the top floor 
 Holding on tight, you and I go 
 Can you feel it in? 
 Can you feel it in? 
 Feel it in? 
 Oh, nothing you could tell us they get jealous when we show up 
 Make you feel like a little girl again, or fuck you like a grown-up 
 High as you can be it's like the dream you never woke from 
 My life's like a movie, get ready for your close up 
 Pour bottle and toast up, your man in your phone tryna to see what your plans is 
 So what, you still turn up my songs soon as they playing it 
 Know what the sayin' is "Money talks" and you ain't saying shit 
 I'mma call you soon as I land 
 Probably roll some weed right up on the beach while you tan 
 Party every week and you hardly would speak 
 But now you got my phone taking pictures, laughing, smoking, chilling, yeah 
 Started out slow 
 Cause no matter how much she gets she wants more 
 Girl now we on the top floor 
 Holding on tight, you and I go 
 Can you feel it in? 
 Can you feel it in? 
 Feel it in? 
 We don't need to worry talk probably 'cause we in the sky, sky, sky, sky 
 When we really take off and I tell her hold on 'cause she say she never been this high 
 We don't need to worry talk probably 'cause we in the sky, sky, sky, sky 
 When we really take off and I tell her hold on 'cause she say she never been this high
