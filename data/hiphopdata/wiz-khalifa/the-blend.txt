Nah, you know what? 
 Sports coup spoiler 
 Sippin' on a bottle of water 
 Damn serious like the 4 quarter 
 Niggas can't get the shit, it's on back order 
 Holler at the waitin and some already spoiled em 
 Bout to give away, the shits can't bored of the money spendin 
 High performance, exhaust systems 
 Straight bossin, more than often 
 Nigga I'm always getting it, straight jet livin' 
 I got all my cars, all my weed, all my women 
 Badly in exotics at mafia style dinners 
 Duck in pictures as we toast to getting richer 
 It was all planned out for us to stand out 
 The have nots have it all 
 Without accepting handouts dawg 
 Twisting the top of the plit jat 
 Hide under 
 Niggas out they rabid ass mind 
 Thinkin' I ain't gon try to get as much money as I could make this year 
 You must be on some hardcore drugs 
 I'm just flippin through magazines and rollin' them raws up 
 My red cup filtered with gin 
 That's my gang and they destined to win 
 In the Stang and you better spin, give good brain 
 You should let er in 
 Leave your cigars, choice already roll I got 
 Weed in the jar, told you that my life's the shit 
 And you gon love it 
 In the morning I got a polaroid of it 
 Wake up feeling way better than you ever did 
 With the nigga that you was with 
 And now you got the nigga all upset because of it 
 Would call my phone but he know that I don't play that 
 Send some real niggas where he stay at 
 Made it quite clear - take yo lips, put 'em right here
