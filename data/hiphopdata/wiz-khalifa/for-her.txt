Higher than you ever been in yo motherfuckin life nigga 
 Without even tryin' 
 Uh, the game got a grip, never slip 
 Could tell by the way I got my hands on it 
 Started at the bottom but now my money's so motherfuckin tall I could stand on it 
 Ain't just happened homie, I planned on it 
 You think you better? Don't just talk 'bout it, put some grands on it 
 Sleep in Cali, woke up in France 
 Harlem, took the life I live 
 Chose to talk 'bout it now my fans on it 
 Now it's Dior all on my pants homie, don't know where I'm goin' 
 My schedule full so I can't call it 
 So much weed, you see all them grams fallin' 
 Rollin' so much up that my fingers startin to cramp on me 
 Hear you talkin' bout what I am 
 On top of that shit you sayin' you gotta say rich as fuck when you mention us 
 I get a hold of the bummest and I twist it up 
 Them Cadillac's in Atlanta front just to pick us up 
 Oh please, won't you put me at ease? 
 I'm chilling inside 
 My feelings tied 
 How will I know this is real? 
 Usually I end up 
 Foolishly I end up 
 Give it all the love I own 
 Then to my dismantle, to you 
 Was just another day 
 You weren't even fun 
 Same shit 
 Hell, I woke up to the jump 
 Cartoons and cereal 
 A coup with 0 miles and oatmeal interior 
 These chicks digging my style, I'm sensei in the superior 
 To whatever you doin' right now 
 And whatever you plan to get into 
 I'm just clackin my mouth 
 On the road to these riches 
 These hoes waving and flading 
 But I don't pay 'em no attention 
 I'm all about my empire 
 We just tryin' to get bigger 
 We want the plan inside us 
 These snakes tryna get with us 
 They lookin' for the co-sign 
 But a real nigga don't give a fuck 
 I'm too busy getting high 
 You can hitch a ride on another truck 
 Now excuse me as I kiss the sky 
 Peace signs to baby girl before she try to kiss me blah 
 She miss me like the sun in her eyes 
 Can't catch a butterfly 
 Kush castles in the sky 
 The only hason is when I smash and go she wanna cry 
 I get dressed, she wonder where I'm going or why 
 Can't deal with that 
 So don't choose 
 I can't stand to be hurt again 
 If you flow it's just today 
 Then smoke and walk away 
 But please don't tease 
 Oh please, won't you put me at ease? 
 Oh please 
 Won't you set me at ease? 
 Please 
 Oh please 
 Please, won't you put me at ease? 
 Won't you set me at ease? 
 Please 
 Oh please 
 Won't you set me at ease? 
 Please 
 Oh please 
 If you feel it's just a day 
 Then smile and walk away...
