I was posted on the block with a big ass joint 
 Police everywhere so we stay on point 
 Money get in my hand, pocket stay gone swow 
 And if you ever ask a question nigga we don't know 
 Don't be talk to me crazy if you ain't by drama 
 And don't even be hit my phone if it ain't about commas 
 Imma ride for my gang everyday with no problems 
 And if a nigga want beef, we filey'em and chop'em 
 I get high everyday, you can say I'mma doctor 
 Got my niggas out the streets, you can say I'm a prophet 
 I got maney in the bank, it can't fit in the wallet 
 I got niggas in the pen, but that ain't on the topic 
 Roll the weed in the paper you would think it was college 
 Got my mind on my money, I'm just focus and honest 
 If a nigga talk crazy then we leave him tarnedge 
 Yeah my crib and the hills but I came from the bottom 
 I ain't worried about the mills 'cause I already got'em 
 Every time I'm in the bank trying make an deposit 
 If I'm hoppin of the plane, know I'm goin' make an profit 
 Got the keys to the game if I wanna unlock it 
 I'll be smokin' KK to you think I am unconscious 
 I'm the real ass nigga know my style ain't polished 
 Yous a fake ass nigga know you can't come around us 
 Was round good weed back when our parents could ground us 
 Now I'm doin' real shit that they say that they proud of 
 Fucked up situations trying get my guys out of 
 If you see a nigga with me best believe that they doubt it 
 Taylor Gang or their God best believe that they shout it 
 I pour up a lot of drink come with me to mountain 
 Keep the money commin in running me like a fountain 
 Lot of fuck niggas hate, I can see 'em they doubt it 
 Don't approach the situation they just reaching around it 
 I ain't scared the confrontation me I'm speaking about it 
 I got so much fuckin' money that I needed to count it 
 I'm so Big you don't see me, you just reading about it 
 If you coming at the Gang then you need to reroudit 
 Wanna know what I maintain what secrets they solve it 
 Niggas wanna know the formula 'cause we now found it 
 Make another 100 mill, it ain't gone be cool about it 
 Made my way about my city yeah it can be kinda violent 
 'Cause when you gettin' money niggas trynna slide on you 
 And when it's said and done them hoes switch sides on you 
 But I got 4 diamonds pieces at the crib waiting for me 
 2 selphones cause the money keep comin' 
 Hoes in my bank and ain't no one fucking with me 
 Smokin' KK like everyday 420 
 Yeah Nigga ugh
