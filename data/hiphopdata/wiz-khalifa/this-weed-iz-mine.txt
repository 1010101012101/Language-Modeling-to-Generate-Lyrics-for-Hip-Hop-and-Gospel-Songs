I wake up early in the morning and it feels so good 
 Smoking on some shit that you wish you could 
 Jealousy, envy please don't feel bad 
 This weed is mine get your own bag 
 A sack full of OG under lock and key 
 None for the homies this is all for me 
 Got a blunt looking like a Kelly palm tree 
 Police roll by I got nothing on me 
 'Cause the smoke's already in the air 
 I am looked up with two braids in my hair 
 All start with the kaki suit 
 I'm gonna fuck around and take it back to classic Snoop 
 On the east side standing on the D-I-P 
 Back then my only wed was my E-Y-E 
 Use my P-Y-T and you're looking so fine 
 I am sorry baby girl but tonight 
 This weed is mine 
 This weed is mine 
 You can't have it 
 This weed is mine 
 This weed is mine 
 You can't have it 
 This weed is mine 
 Back to the episode sacks full of chronic 
 Out of this world, Cooper Black's on the comic 
 This is church music listen to the choir 
 To burn my kush you must use fire 
 D-O, double G like never heard before 
 Smoking that bomb like THC4 
 West coast worldwide, sea shore to sea shore 
 When's the last time you seen the G in the G4 
 Don't worry I'll wait 
 Time's ticking I'm tripping 
 I'm slipping, I'll wait 
 Into the zone where these hoes hold my dog bones 
 I dog whistle and they download my ring tone 
 And she's so hypnotized by this pimp's poem 
 What I got here is mine go and get your own 
 I put peace to rhymes get piece of mind 
 O-Z to die 'cause this weed is mine 
 I hear niggers talking about what they rollin' up 
 Smell what I smoke 'fore the back open up 
 Good chance you can see me there, I'm smoking one 
 License to get a fundamental road of shit 
 Real nigger blowing weed for hours, rolled it up 
 If I am in a building it's hard not to notice it 
 Hitta Billy said, "Dogg I got some hoes to fuck" 
 I am gonna fuck you with an ounce of that potent shit 
 Don't trip bitch we gonna all sip, blow the hoes dip 
 Let you have mine plus you supplyin' your own little bit 
 My nigger get high and let the hoes twist 
 Say you don't fuck with twist look how you rolled it 
 They ain't smoking like 'cause I'm rollin' enough paper 
 They've be burning for hours 
 And if it's fire I am smocking the whole thing inside 
 I got a roll for you 
 Do you wanna smoke with me 
 I wanna smoke with you 
 Do you wanna smoke with me 
 I got a roll for you 
 Do you wanna smoke with me 
 I wanna smoke with you 
 Do you, do you, do you 
 Wanna smoke with me 
 I said I wanna smoke with you 
 Do you wanna smoke with me 
 I said I wanna smoke with you
