 I'm telling you 
 They say the game done changed, man there's just some new players in it 
 And they don't wanna see my team get up there and win it 
 Try to keep me still, but look where I'm at now 
 I made it too far to look back down 
 But I ain.t never ever gone forget what I been told 
 And I ain't never ever going back to being broke 
 Cause, F-Y-I

 They say the game done changed, man there's just some new players in it 
 And they don't wanna see my team get up there and win it 
 Try to keep me still, but look where I'm at now
