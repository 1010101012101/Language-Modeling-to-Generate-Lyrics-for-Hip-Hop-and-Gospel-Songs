 You niggas know it's the Gang or kill yourself right? 
 Yeah 
 Yup 
 Red hat, black Chucks, black 501's on

 Let her out the house and I'll be leaving here with your bitch 
 I'm flying in a different city every night 
 Got everything I ever wanted so this can't be life 
 Breaking down the weed about to make a plane 
 A hundred niggas with me, all repping Taylor Gang 
 Yeah bitch

 Feed her alcohol and leave that bitch with no taste

 Back seat and I'ma ride until the chrome break 
 Big heat'll turn your body to a cold case 
 She don't even make it rain she just throw me face 
 Got some niggas quick to bang like they Major Pain 
 Told their mom I rep the Gang, she just say the same

 I pull up in car service looking like the man 
 Hella reefer smoke, a lot of pictures being taken

 Took her car keys, and let her played Dwayne
