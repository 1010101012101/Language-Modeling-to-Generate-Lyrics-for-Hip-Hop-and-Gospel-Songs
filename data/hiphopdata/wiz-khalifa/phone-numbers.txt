I cop me one, cop me one for my old girl 
 You think she my newest bitch, she my old girl 
 Khalifa, a younger n-gga who handle his 
 Hoes get in my car, ask what the channel is 
 Boss shit, look that up n-gga, I handle biz 
 On fire, like a candle is 
 N-ggas be dressing off the manikin 
 Hmmm, and I get fresh like where them camera's is 
 Better yet sandwiches, bad bitch Spanish friends 
 Coulda been the President, rather be the man instead 
 Now when I get paid, my checks be lookin' like phone numbers 
 Now when I get paid, my checks be lookin' like phone numbers 
 (You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million) 
 I'm talkin' millions, n-gga I'm talkin' millions 
 (You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million) 
 I'm talkin' millions, n-gga I'm talkin' millions 
 Time is money so I went and bought a Rolex (bought a Rolex) 
 Time is money so I went and bought a Rolex (bought a Rolex) 
 I'm talkin' millions, n-gga I'm talkin' millions 
 (You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million) 
 I'm talkin' millions, n-gga I'm talkin' millions 
 (You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million, whaaaaaat) 
 (Trae Tha Truth - Verse 2) 
 I'm in the hood (?) on this something corner surfing 
 Float, no water, my trunk is waving, I'm polar surfing 
 Blowing faces, I'm shittin? on them diamond infested 
 Time is money, peep the wrist bitch, my time is invested 
 I'm still the king and I'm thugged out 
 Any block any club I flood it out 
 I ain't the one for competition I?ma blow it out 
 I'm going hard I don't ever plan on going out 
 I'm getting money, probably something you don't know about 
 I stunt hard, you would swear that I was showin? out 
 Don't tell me get ?em, I got 'em and I?mma throw 'em out 
 And back door on these hoes that I was warning out 
 While I'm in this machine, convert the top 
 Tell them that the sky is the limit 
 With a four of freaks, she got her face in my lap so deep you would think 
 That she was hiding in it 
 (Big Sean) 
 Shrimp, steak, liquor and pasta 
 Real shit boi, these n-ggas imposters 
 They deserve an Oscar, Kevin Costner 
 Oh my God sir, what? 
 I got this and that and everything I want like I got a hostage, yeah 
 Countin'? 7 digits, no wonder why the money calling 
 Got ya bitch panties Niagra fallin'? 
 Dollars cum like I f-ck in the bank 
 I told them I could, they tell me I can't 
 They want me to trip when I'm d-cking the paint 
 I'm poppin' champagne and puffin? on dank 
 Shining hard, boy, these n-ggas gotta see me 
 My d-ck hard, your bitch is easy 
 (Boi, boi, boi)
