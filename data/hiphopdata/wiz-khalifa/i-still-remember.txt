It's a new year, new day, 
 The hardest regardless of what you dudes say truthfully 
 Who we glue to me, money talks was taught to speak fluently 
 Its nothin' new to me, sometimes it takes three blunts to get through to me 
 It only took me months to get through the streets, 
 But when you got beats and your lyrics are dumb hard, 
 Nobody gotta let you in the game you just bombard 
 Yeah but niggas are gon hate though, 
 No matter who you are there's another wantin' your place bro 
 Mind on cash roll the grass and fade slow, learn fast to? 
 A look past the love some niggas ain't sure, 
 Made me my own man now I do my grown man 
 More advanced a young'n nearly in the game, 
 Shit lookin' better now but I remember the rain 
 Rain, 
 I still remember the rain 
 I still remember the rain 
 I still remember the rain 
 I still remember the rain 
 I still remember 
 Feelin' slept on knowin' I'm the best 
 Songwriter or freestyle ill bite a niggas head off 
 The flow was ill before I inked the deal I signed 
 'Cause a flow like mine needs a mill 
 I grind for real and that's no days off 
 You work hard for it and its gon pay off 
 You can rap you can work a j-o-b or duckin' 
 The policeman cars tryna pump weight off 
 See I was taught to get it how you live 
 Niggas know wiz' has been about his bread 
 In the ? I'm a beast I can speak to 'em all day 
 In high school have what you need in the hallways 
 Stuff long benches with raw haze attention is nothing 
 New its true I've been that nigga always 
 So what you sayin' 
 Remain the same with fame I gained its good now 
 But I remember the rain 
 Rain, 
 I still remember the rain 
 I still remember the rain 
 I still remember the rain 
 I still remember the rain 
 I still remember 
 Rain
