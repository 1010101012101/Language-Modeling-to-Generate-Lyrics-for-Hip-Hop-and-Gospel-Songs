I worked hard for everything so why not salute 
 They say a grime pays baby all I got is proof 
 And the Swedish broad better than my main bitch 
 Cigarillo roll you smell it when it ain't lit 
 She don't cook well but she give me sweet brain 
 Make a rapper turn singer like t-pain 
 Got her stayin up late, wakin' up baked 
 And to think this the life that I chose 
 Argue with attendants that shorted my flight clothes 
 And er'y girl I fuck feel like their boyfriend might know 
 Smoking on the Swedish it smells my weed come in barrels 
 Fuck with bitches who fiend for Gucci and need her chanel 
 Nigga I'm high of your life so my eyes low 
 Can't wait to see what's in the future but I drive slow 
 And wait for the picture, hate it now they say and I can miss like mister 
 All of the smoking all you got me thinkin' 
 And all of this dreamin' I'm supposed to, the life like, the weekend 
 Know where I'm goin', sound though, want to see me suceedin 
 That I've been livin', smokin', smoking, dreamin', livin' 
 I go to sleep with a picture of a porche on my wall 
 Nigga I'm tryin' to come up on y'all 
 Pop the trunk in front of my car in front of your broad, 
 She reconsider in her decision to fuck with y'all 
 I think its because of the possibility of kickin it courtside, ringside, front row of anything 
 Living my life simultaneously in a dream, shit going so good I swear 
 There are Planes stack change with their gang tail up 
 Wings spread over cities leave shadows everywhere 
 I care less about industry mingling 
 Niggas is wwf wrestlers, court jesters and crossdressers 
 I got them crosstrainers, nike ass beat 
 Niggas can't feel my shoes, I'm a nice MC 
 I had a dream that I caked up, trying to roll a joint, will count a million when I wake up
