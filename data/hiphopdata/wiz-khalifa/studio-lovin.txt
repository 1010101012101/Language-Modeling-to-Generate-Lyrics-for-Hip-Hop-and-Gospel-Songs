 Girl Let Me Take You To My Studio 
 Give You Everything You Want And Need 
 Lay You Flat Like A Piano 
 If You Let Me Stroke Your Keys 
 You Going Be Saying Things You Never Said 
 Matter Fact You Going Be Playing Melodies You Never Played 
 We Ain't In No Bed, 
 We In The Lab 
 And I'm Reclining In My Seat 
 You Can Just Climb On Top Of Me And Ride Me Like This Beat 
 You Say You Need This (Loving) 
 Well Imma Grab Your Wasteline, 
 And If You Like It Deep, 
 I Could Hit You With That Baseline 
 I Ain't Tryin' To Waste Time 
 For Me And Your Sake 
 Plus I'm Payin' For This Session 
 I Need More Than One Take 
 I Make The Boards Shake Like How I'm Suppose To 
 I'll Have You Sounding Good 
 Lil Ma, I Got Them Pro Tunes 
 Now You In The Mood 
 I Got You Doing This And Tryin' That 
 Beating Your Drum 
 While I'm Playing With Your High Hat 
 You Like That 
 So You Don't Want To, I Just Make You Do It 
 Got You In Love, 'Cause When We Fuck It's Like We Making Music, Go 'n' Lose It 
 I don't want to be unusual 
 But there's a lot of things that I can see me doing to you. 
 Here in my studio oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh yeeaaa. 
 You say you gotta work tomorrow, you can make it though, 
 And even though there's probably other places we can go, 
 We in my studio, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh yeeaaa 
 And No It Ain't Gon Stop 
 I Keep This Song On Replay 
 Putting All Them Scratches On My Back 
 I'm Like Go DJ 
 Be My Guitar 
 I'll Pluck Your G-String 
 Pull It To The Side 
 Imma Make Them Vocals Drop 
 I'm Gripping On Your Thighs 
 We Tangled Like Some Cables 
 From The Front look In Your Eyes 
 Then I Turn You Like Some tables 
 No You Fiending For This (Loving) 
 That's What You Gon Get 
 And I Can't Sing, But I See You 
 And Know I'm Gonn Hit, Yeaa 
 Lets Do The Verses Now 
 Worry About The Beat Later 
 Heard You Be Going Off That Head 
 You Don't Need Paper 
 Play You An E-Major, A-Minor 
 Girl Your Rhythm Straight 
 And I Say You Got Great Timing 
 Feel Your Heart Rate Climbing 
 Like When My Speakers Quake 
 More Than okay or Straight 
 You Got That 8-O-8 
 You Say You Can't 
 But I Do Something That Just Make You Do It 
 Me And You Don't Fuck 
 We Make Music, Yeaa 
 I don't want to be unusual 
 But there's a lot of things that I can see me doing to you. 
 Up in my studio oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh yeeaaa. 
 You say you gotta work tomorrow, you can make it though, 
 And even thought there's probably other places we can go, 
 We in my studio, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh yeeaaa
