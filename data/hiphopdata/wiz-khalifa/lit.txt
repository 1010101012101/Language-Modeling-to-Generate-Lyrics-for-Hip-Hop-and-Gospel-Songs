We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire 
 Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire 
 Won't smoke, won't pass, won't hit it if it ain't fire 
 Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire 
 We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire 
 Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire 
 Won't smoke, won't pass, won't hit it if it ain't fire 
 Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire 
 Let's get to the basics, let's get to the basics 
 I'm rollin' a J up, I'm lovin' the fragrance 
 I'm hardly on time cause my mind is where space is 
 But I always on grind cause that's how my fam raised me 
 Think I got problems, say that I'm crazy 
 Love marijuana, smoke on the daily 
 Smoke with my mama, roll one for my lady 
 Blow the whole pound now, came up from an eighty 
 I'm lettin' the top down, and countin' them faces 
 I'm blowin' the smoke out, exhalin' the vapors 
 I'm smokin' in public, they stare in amazement 
 I'm lightin' that bomb up, it's takin' me places 
 We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire 
 Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire 
 Won't smoke, won't pass, won't hit it if it ain't fire 
 Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire 
 We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire 
 Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire 
 Won't smoke, won't pass, won't hit it if it ain't fire 
 Don't spend no time on a bitch if she ain't fire
