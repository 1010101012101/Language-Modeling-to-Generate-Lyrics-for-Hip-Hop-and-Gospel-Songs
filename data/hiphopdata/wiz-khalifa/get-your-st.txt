I'm tired of arguing and fighting girl 
 Every night you keep callin' me with the same shit 
 I'm goin' insane 
 I swear I love you but this ain't right for us 
 I never thought it would end this way, it's gonna kill me to say 
 But you gotta 
 Pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go 
 Pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go 
 Pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go 
 Told you that I'm movin' on you didn't well you oughta know 
 To mold you I admit was my mission 
 But everything went wrong there 
 'Cause you start actin' different 
 The day you ran up on me 
 I was smokin', chillin' 
 Swore you was tryin' to roll 
 Ain't know I was so appealin' 
 Fast forward I'm on the road, you at home 
 Callin' me back, forth 
 Can't deal with this relationship 
 But this what you asked for, 
 Ask for them pictures of them bitches, 
 Shit, I probably wouldn't be wit 'em if your ass wasn't trippin', 
 Not to mention you action like a kid, is the fuck shit I gotta deal wit' 
 Send a text, leave me a message try not to listen 
 Bring a wrap, you was the main player, 
 I had to bench you when I showed yo ass how to ball 
 That Louie I bought it all. 
 I'm tired of arguing and fighting girl (uh) 
 Every night you keep callin' me with the same shit 
 I'm goin' insane 
 I swear I love you but this ain't right for us 
 I never thought it would end this way, 
 It's gonna kill me to say 
 But you gotta 
 Pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go 
 Pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go 
 Pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go 
 Told you that I'm movin' on you didn't, well you oughta know 
 Gone on the road and I'm hardly home on the weekend 
 You'll be blowin' my phone up, try to see who I'm seein' 
 But I'm chasin' this paper, so for this paper I'm reachin' 
 Might fuck one or two bitches but don't consider it cheatin' 
 I consider the fact I will break up anyway, anyway 
 Based on all the shit that you don't appreciate, 
 Me switchin' states, workin' hard, meetin' dates 
 'N' you were thinkin' everything was sweet, piece of cake 
 Well that all changed 
 What we had was big but you gon' miss the small things, 
 'N' that lil' cash I spent, that was small change, 
 But above all things, I still love you 
 Just gotta do my own thing, uh 
 I'm tired of arguing and fighting girl 
 Every night you keep callin' me with the same shit 
 I'm goin' insane 
 I swear I love you but this ain't right for us 
 I never thought it would end this way, 
 It's gonna kill me to say 
 But you gotta 
 Pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go 
 Pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go 
 Pack your stuff, leave my keys, get your shit, gotta go 
 Told you that I'm movin' on you didn't, well you oughta know 
 I'll go I never come back 
 Now when you call I never call back 
 'Cause I gotta new girl 
 Yeah, I gotta new girl 
 Everything was all good then went all bad 
 You know I don't think 'bout the times that we had 
 'Cause, I gotta new girl, yeah, I gotta new girl, yeah.
