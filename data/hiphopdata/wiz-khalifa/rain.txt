I made it rain (hahahahaha, hurricane-cane) 
 I made it rain like a hurricane-cane 
 I made it rain (Party... and Khalifa, man) 
 I made it rain (oh, fuck!) 
 I made it rain 
 I made it rain (I made her rep the game, nigga) 
 Ugh! 
 Khalifa papers, no cigarillos 
 Stuffin' your face all up in the pillow 
 Grabbin' you close and pullin' you nearer 
 Lookin' at both of us in the mirror 
 Pick you up, roll you 'round in the Chevy 
 Put this dick in your life if you let me 
 All of my niggas, not like them niggas 
 Fuck about it, how I'm gettin' dollars, my nigga 
 If you got a problem, gonna holla, my nigga 
 Young Khalifa tatted to the collar, my nigga 
 She swallow a nigga cause my dollars is bigger 
 And you know Party my nigga 
 I made it rain like a hurricane-cane 
 I made it rain like a hurricane-cane 
 I made it rain 
 I made it rain 
 I made it rain 
 I made it rain 
 Let me get into it, let you smoke a little bit 
 Now fuck you better than the nigga you with 
 When I met you, you were innocent 
 Now your pussy gettin' wet soon as you mention me 
 Guess it was just meant to be 
 Fuckin' with me got me goin' way up 
 Slammin' in that pussy, never lay up 
 Fuckin' up your makeup 
 Make me cheese eggs when I wake up 
 You ain't here in need, hurry up and break up 
 Run around the world, I don't run games 
 Run into your bitch, I'ma find out her name 
 Let her rep the game, let her wear my chain 
 Let her give me brain 
 Soon as I put it in... 
 I made it rain like a hurricane-cane 
 I made it rain like a hurricane-cane 
 I made it rain 
 I made it rain 
 I made it rain 
 I made it rain
