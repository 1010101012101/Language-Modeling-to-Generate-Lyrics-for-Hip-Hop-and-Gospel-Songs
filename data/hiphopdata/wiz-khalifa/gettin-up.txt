It's young khalifa 
 Mr. look the fuck up 
 All that 
 Hahaha 
 Feeling real good about life 
 Got a drink poured 
 Blunt lit 
 Let's go 
 Excuse me, my jeans levi, my shoes is gucci 
 Hoes like who he 
 On the paper chase, don't waste my loose leaf 
 A nigga paying bills, lightin L's on the beach 
 But I still move with the goons on a loose leesh. 
 Some call it weird, hoes call it unique 
 Swag like I just stepped out a boutique 
 And I spit like I got a mouth full of loose teeth 
 Closet full of new sneaks that I probably never wear 
 I'm in that president suite, bad bitch 
 And if them niggas ain't me, average 
 I treat a beat like a canvas 
 Bar bras on the song paint it perfect 
 Ever run out of weed, I throw a purp fit 
 I keep the army at ease cause y'all ain't worth it 
 Been considered hipster, cause my shirts fit 
 The way your bitch hit my chirp, make a hip hurt 
 Young nigga riding that wave, picturing me surfin'
