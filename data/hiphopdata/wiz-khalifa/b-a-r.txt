Fuckin' hoes everywhere we go 
 Taylor Gang, paper planes 
 Uh, they lovin' what I say 
 Tell her keep count 
 What you other niggaz speak bout 
 Lamborghini dreams, beach house wishes 
 Poor bottles of champagne for my beach house bitches 
 It ain't new to me, the money boy I been bout 
 Throwin' 100's on the floor, I tell her keep count 
 Nigga, they in love wit what I say 
 'Cause I, really live the life you other niggaz speak bout 
 Got my camera man, he down to do a movie for me 
 Couple niggaz round us, down to do the shootin' for me 
 I'm still ridin' wit my main bitch 
 She rollin' the joint, somethin' old school playin' 
 She love me, we fuck and we in the fly-free zone 
 When some niggaz will captain-save-it 
 I let her shop till she drop dead 
 Sleepin' in her crib, wake up to decent pot plan 
 Jordan shorts and a pear of polo socks, blazin' 
 Wit yo bitch, you wanna live smoke this 
 I'm glad to be here, I been waitin' so long (so long, so long) 
 I finally found me a cloud to float on (float on) 
 And I'ma float on (float on) 
 Float on (float on) 
 And I'ma float on (float on) 
 Float on, float on, float on 
 And I don't have much, but I'll take all I got and that's what I give (what I give) 
 What I get in return is the money I earn, and the life I live (life I live) 
 I'm so gone as I burn after rolling (after rolling) 
 And float on, and float on, and float on 
 Talk numbers, I hire people to speak for me 
 If you love her, then hide your bitch so you keep shorty 
 Ever fly private 
 So much diamonds in my chain, hella sky mileage 
 I fell asleep on a plane 
 And never woke up, and now I'm living a dream 
 Suckas hate hard, hoes treat me like I'm a king 
 They wanna live comfortably, sippin on champagne 
 Real niggaz fuck with me, so drama is not a thing 
 I gave my momma the ocean 
 Told her anything to come through the door to open the whole clip 
 I'm wit yo bitch smokin', let her keep the mid, I'ma roll this potent 
 Hotel so close to the water 
 You can even here the ocean 
 Them bitches can't breathe 
 Beware of them niggaz wit tattoo sleeves 
 Wanna smoke, 'cause they know that I keep flavors 
 Tell me how them other niggaz lame 
 And she love the cool crowd, so she fuckin' with the Taylors 
 Wear All-Stars and smoke papers 
 IPhone with no ringtones 
 Vibrate or on plane mode 
 Palm trees and bomb pre-rolls 
 The weed burnin, but the money just fold 
 While I'm lookin' at you niggaz face 
 Light another L, and pull the liquor out the case 
 Niggaz try and fail, see me now they wanna hate 
 Fly another plane, a different city, another state 
 My cash change the forecast 
 As the team was half-baked before class 
 Now I smoke joints wit others niggaz hoes, and this shit you burn after you roll 
 Fool
