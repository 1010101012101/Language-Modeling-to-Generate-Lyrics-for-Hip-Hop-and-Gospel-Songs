Shit 
 It's Wiz Khalifa man 
 This shit hot, right? 
 Now don't blink cause the flow is closer, don't think 
 True diplomat, no Jim Jones and no Pink 
 And the city wanna know what, except that I claim 
 Blackout be the gang, it's attached to my veins 
 And I don't got a problem giving naps to Elaine 
 Order every syllable, every rap to my name, ye 
 The grim reaper came back with a cane 
 That's me, spittin' crack to your brain 
 Niggers, they can't stand me, ladies, they demand me 
 Damn your man's handy 
 And I'm the mayor when I blam with them hands 
 Have you seeing stars like you walk with them Grammies 
 Your reign was short, I'm running it now 
 Knock your teeth out for biting, now you be gunning my style 
 I keep it, honey I'm selling them, I'm the blackout 
 Put my sneakers to your face, you'll be running your mouth 
 It's too late nigga 
 It's too late nigga 
 Man, it's too late 
 Y'all niggas ain't early enough 
 It's my time nigga 
 And some say I'm contradictory 
 'Cause I flow nice and spit I mean, trying to get green 
 Play it how I split teams 
 You'll be sixteen, storming nigga sixteen 
 Six two, feeling glock with a sick lean 
 Big dreams, only two words, get green 
 Which means never had no job 
 I spit, to keep it simple, the truth like no lies 
 No god, I know why 
 I make it clear, there's no reason for your life 
 And I make it ahead, see me speeding and blow by 
 You dudes fake, I see through you with closed eyes 
 And won't stop, till they can get rich 
 And make pay from the rap I spit 
 It ain't hard to tell, like a snitch, that I'm next on deck 
 And care less about who making the pay 
 Listen, it's too late 
 It's too late nigga 
 It's too late man 
 It's too late 
 Y'all dudes fake, pray for me 
 It's my time nigga 
 You catch rabies if you bite this hair 
 Safe to say I don't like to share, ye 
 You see I'm what the ladies want, so they like to stare 
 I'm a beast, I eat tracks and bite the snare 
 See I got blind eyes and they like the glare 
 Dudes hate 'cause I rock shit they like to wear 
 And I'll battle anybody who can fight the fan 
 Spit, crack, put the pipe in their ears 
 And my boys have the nigga broke down in a second 
 Shots split a clown into sections 
 Round your protection, I'm back at it like a crack addict 
 The fact I spit crack dog, I'm ass-backwards 
 I lay it down, bring a clown to his knees 
 See, we be a truce in D, ye 
 And niggas faking like they kicking 'cause they moving them keys 
 But if I shoot you I be doing a deed nigga 
 It's too late 
 It's too late nigga 
 It's too late man 
 It's too late 
 Y'all niggas ain't early enough 
 It's my turn nigga
