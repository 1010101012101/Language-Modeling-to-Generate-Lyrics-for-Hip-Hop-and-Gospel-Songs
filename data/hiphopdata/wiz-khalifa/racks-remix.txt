Got campaign going so strong 
 Getting brain while I'm talking on the phone 
 Spend money when ya moneys this long 
 Real street niggas ain't no clone 
 We at the top where we belong 
 Spread lean rozay patrone 
 Smoking on thousand dollar worth of strong 
 When the club outta here its on 
 Got Racks on racks on racks 
 Racks on racks on racks 
 Racks on racks on racks 
 Got Racks on racks on racks 
 Got Racks on racks on racks 
 Racks on racks on racks 
 Racks on racks on racks 
 Nigga hating me ain't even tryna hold back 
 Got a crawl outta my garage 
 Got a condo down in the stars 
 I'm geaked up off them bars 
 Got a car I don't even gotta park 
 No keys push button start 
 She ain't a dime I won't get hard 
 Got hoes that need a green card 
 Say I'ma dawg but I don't even gotta bark 
 Got swag that bite like sharks 
 One hit I'ma knock it out the park 
 Trap beating so goddamn hard 
 Got Kush, Got Lean, Got barre 
 Got remix hard as scale 
 Got bricks don't need no scale 
 I'm plugged in with the mail 
 I'm part of the cartel 
 Got rerock ain't no cling 
 6 two hundred for a nin 
 Then fuck it all up on jeans 
 I'ma true religion fiend' 
 Got bands in the pockets of my jeans 
 Need a kickstand way I lean 
 Promethazine fiend 
 Stamped on sprite and lean 
 Got campaign going so strong 
 Getting brain while I'm talking on the phone

 Real street niggas ain't no clone 
 We at the top where we belong 
 Spread lean rozay patrone 
 Smoking on thousand dollar worth of strong 
 When the club outta here its on 
 Wiz Khalifa 
 Racks on, racks off 
 See that blonde strip when my hats off 
 Looking at my rollie, bout 30 grams what that cost 
 Smoke like I'm in Cali, f-ck, take a flight, I'll blast off 
 Niggas talkin' tattoos, we should have a tat off 
 Got racks on racks on racks, naps on naps on naps 
 Just made a mill, count another mill so put that on top of that 
 Way back in 2004 I told them it was a wrap 
 Now my life ain't my life no more I told you niggas it's a wrap, eww 
 You claim you a dog, my nigga, I'm the vet 
 We can't even talk unless you cut the check 
 I guess that's why all these niggas get mad 
 They say f-ck a young nigga, f-ck a young nigga 
 I know there's some girls in the crowd right now who wanna f-ck a young nigga, ya 
 I roll one and roll another one bigger, niggas thinking they sick well I'm sicker 
 Ima smoke my weed, and ima drink my liquor 
 Better make sure you f-ck your girl right before I dick her... down

 Y'all know I keep them racks 
 I stay counting them stacks 
 Ya girl won't leave me lone 
 Wanna f-ck now she attached 
 Flow hot don't need no match 
 Sell work don't pay no tax 
 I'm turnt up to the max 
 Don't even know how to relax 
 I drank so much that lean 
 Had to wake up on a bean 
 Got racks all in my jeans 
 Man busting out the seams 
 Got kush all in my lungs 
 Get High like cheech and chong 
 800 a zone I ain't blowin' unless it strong 
 Catch hell on my iphone 
 Catch mine and then I'm gone 
 The girl won't leave 
 I can not take her home 
 I'm gone on them bars 
 Bitch I'm not a star 
 I'm driving foreign cars 
 Strapped up no bodyguards
