(Wiz Khalifa - Chorus) 
 I bought a whole O to smoke 
 I'm riding high 
 My n-ggas with me, they down to ride 
 I got my change up, they looking like they surprised 
 Got n-ggas hatin' on me hard cause my paper right 
 Money from the flo' way up to the sky 
 Now they wanna know and they wonder why 
 I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly 
 I put my chain on, they saying it's homocide 
 And I'm killin' 'em, it's homocide 
 I'm killin' 'em, it's homocide 
 (Young Jeezy) 
 It ain't even fair 
 Got the Mazi' out, look like Nicki here 
 White drop head, call it white chalk 
 Burn the insides, 57 soft 
 And n-gga I'm killin' 'em, bring the body bags 
 Count a million, fill the body bag 
 In my murder coupe, call it toe tag 
 Spend a grip n-gga, call me 4 Jags 
 And n-gga I'm killin' 'em, call a murder case 
 Got my Rolli' on, got the murder face 
 Roll another blunt, dust my shoulders off 
 N-ggas hatin' Young, watch me shake 'em off 
 I brought a whole O to smoke 
 I'm riding high 
 My n-ggas with me, they down to ride 
 I got my change up, they looking like they surprised 
 Got n-ggas hatin' on me hard 'cause my paper right 
 Money from the flo' way up to the sky 
 Now they wanna know and they wonder why 
 I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly 
 I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide 
 And I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide 
 I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide 
 I got my change up, they looking like they surprised 
 N-ggas hatin' on me hard cause my paper right 
 But I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide 
 I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide 
 I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly 
 I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide 
 I'm killin' 'em 
 (Chevy Woods) 
 With black on black cars coming through 
 Presidential sh-t, tints on the whip 
 So dark can't see who riding in that b-tch 
 Suits and tie's no questions why 
 Somebody get a box ready for these guys 
 No four door, had the coupe that ride 
 That eagle right here if you wanna feel fly 
 No games though, no names spoke 
 This crack right here, cocaine flow 
 I don't know what you doing but I'm paid bro 
 Yeah I pitch that 9 like pedro 
 Stuck in the car with my n-gga I'm ready to ride 
 We on our way to the top, watch that paper rise 
 (Chevy Woods) 
 Keep telling everybody what you gonna do 
 Middle finger like f-ck what you going through 
 All I know is that money that I'm going to 
 And them gang boys wanna bore you 
 Like wassup 'cause I told you 
 Just money in the pocket, fold you 
 T-A-Y-L-O-R G-A-N-G Gang 
 I brought a whole O to smoke 
 I'm riding high 
 My n-ggas with me, they down to ride 
 I got my change up, they looking like they surprised 
 Got n-ggas hatin' on me hard 'cause my paper right 
 Money from the flo' way up to the sky 
 Now they wanna know and they wonder why 
 I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly 
 I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide 
 And I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide 
 I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide 
 I got my change up, they looking like they surprised 
 N-ggas hatin' on me hard cause my paper right 
 But I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide 
 I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide 
 I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly 
 I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide 
 I'm killin' 'em 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 First 48, first 48 
 Took out 50 racks and blew the first 48 
 I ain't worried about spending bread 'cause I got more to make 
 Soon as they see that Maserati they gone surely hate 
 Hundred for a show, can you afford a date 
 And that's just one show, imagine what my tour gon make? 
 Police ran up on my tour bus 
 But hey my n-ggas more money more problems 
 More lawyers on the case 
 N-ggas at the Grammys 
 I was at the crib working 
 Heard they little diss but I'm just being the big person 
 Never been trained, still my aim near perfect 
 Everything I spits murder, bow!
