Uh, smoke weed everyday 
 Young nigga's get rich 
 Rich nigga's gon' ball 
 Young nigga's ask prices 
 My nigga's buy it all 
 Rockin' shit that's foreign 
 Driving cars brand new cars 
 Youngest nigga in charge 
 Now your bitch at large 
 Hol up, what they sayin' 
 OG Kush in my plane 
 Diamonds all in my chain 
 Young nigga doin' his thing 
 Young nigga gon' stunt 
 Buy whatever he want 
 My section very important 
 Come through the back, not the front (oh!) 
 Smokin' and flying 
 No drinking and driving 
 I ball till I fall 
 No need for retiring 
 You nigga's stessed out 
 My nigga's just chillin' 
 Young nigga's in the building 
 Young nigga's get millions 
 And I want to celebrate 
 Celebrate living 
 I could've been dead 
 I could've in prision 
 So Imma celebrate 
 Celebrate ballin' 
 Back then I had no fault 
 Now all these bitches callin' 
 Smoke, drink, blow checks 
 Rolex, more sex 
 'Cause I can afford it 
 I fucked around and just bought it 
 So I want to celebrate 
 Celebrating living 
 Celebrate living 
 To the car, we livin' 
 Rich nigga's go hard 
 Never wanna be broke 
 Broke nigga's just hate 
 Never wanna be rich 
 Rich nigga's buy it all 
 Buy it all for the clique 
 Buy it all for my dogs 
 You buy it all for a bitch 
 Broke nigga's be jokin' 
 Little nigga's need coaching 
 Them bottles aren't even open 
 Homie, that ain't the shit 
 My chain shit on your car 
 My rolex fucked your bitch 
 My chain shit on your car 
 My rolex fucked your bitch 
 Just came home from tour 
 Half a mill when I'm bored 
 Y'all nigga's can't afford it 
 Rich nigga's want more 
 Y'all nigga's tapped out 
 Rich nigga's want more 
 Bitch nigga I'm ballin' 
 Rich nigga, I'm Mike Jordan 
 And I want to celebrate 
 Celebrate living 
 I could've been dead 
 I could've in prision 
 So Imma celebrate 
 Celebrate ballin' 
 Back then I had no fault 
 Now all these bitches callin' 
 Smoke, drink, blow checks 
 Rolex, more sex 
 'Cause I can afford it 
 I fucked around and just bought it 
 So I want to celebrate 
 Celebrating living 
 Celebrate living 
 To the car, we livin'
