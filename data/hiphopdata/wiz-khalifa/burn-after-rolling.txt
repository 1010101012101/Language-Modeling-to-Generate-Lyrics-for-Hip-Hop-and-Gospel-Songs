Taylor Gang 
 Paper planes 
 You know what I say, tell them to keep count 
 You other niggas speak bout 
 Lamborgini dreams, beach house wishes, pour bottles of champagene for my beach house bitches 
 It ain't new to me that money boy I been bout. throwing 100s on the floor, I tell her keep 
 Count. nigga they ain't loving what I say 'cause I really live the life you other niggas speak bout 
 Got my cameraman he down to do a movie for me, couple niggas round us down to do the shooting 
 For me. I'm still riding with my main bitch she rolling the joints something old school playing 
 She love me, we fucking we in the fly free zone when some niggas will cap and save it. 
 I let her shop till she dropped dead sleeping in the crib wake up to decent pot plant 
 Short shorts and a pair of polo socks blazing with your bitch, if you wanna live smoke this 
 I'm glad to be here out the way in so long so long so long 
 I finally found me a cloud to float on float on 
 And I'm gonna float on float on float on float on 
 And I'm gonna float on float on float on float on float on 
 And I don't have much but I take all I got and that's what I give what I give 
 What I get in return is the money I earn and the life I live life I live 
 I'm so gone as I burn after rolling after rolling and float on float on float on 
 Talk numbers I hire people to speak for me, if you love her hide your bitch so you 
 Keep shorty ever fly private so much diamonds in my chain hella sky mileage 
 I fell asleep on a plane and never woke up and now I'm living the dream 
 Suckas hate hard hoes treat me like I'm a king they wanna live comfortably 
 Sippin on champagene real niggas fuck with me so drama is not a thing 
 I gave my momma the osha told her anything that came through the door 
 Open the whole clip I'm with your bitch smoking let her keep the mid 
 I'm gonna roll this potent hotel so close to the water you can even hear 
 The ocean. them bitches can't breathe beware them niggas with tattooed sleeves 
 Wanna smoke 'cause they know that I keep flavors tell me how them other niggas 
 Lame and she love the cool breath so she fucking with the taylors 
 Wear Allstars and smoke papers iphone with no ringtone vibrator on plane mode 
 Palm trees and bompree road the weed burning but the money just flow 
 While I'm looking at your niggas fate light another L and pull the liqour 
 Out the case niggas try and bail see me now they want to hate fly another plane 
 Different city nother state my cash change the forecast as the team was half baked 
 Before class now I smoke joints with other niggas hoes and this shit you burn after 
 You roll fool.
