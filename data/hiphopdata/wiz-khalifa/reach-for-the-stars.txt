 Might as well reach for the stars 
 Way up in the air where you'll be alone 
 Might as well reach for the stars 
 Even if you don't make it, you'll still be with the great ones, yeah 
 (Yeah) 
 My path, been clear 
 The bottom, been near 
 My plate, gon' share 
 My grind, took years 
 I've faced, my fears 
 I've passed, my peers 
 I've switched, them gears 
 They in, the rear 
 Goin' hard, there no stoppin' him 
 Everyday gotta thank God again 
 Money really ain't no problem 
 Nigga talk crazy, gon' ride on him 
 Niggas turn they back 
 Then they wanna be on your side again 
 Nigga keep a "D" like alphabet 
 We ain't tryna be (?)

 Ten toes to the ground, I must blow 
 On my way up, but I do this for us though 
 Whatever you set your mind to you can do that, do that 
 On the ground, full-time I shine 'cause I'm puttin' in work nigga true that, true that 
 Ain't it funny how the world go round 
 Ain't nothin' new to me under the sun 
 If I did it, Wiz did it, Kray did it, changed it 
 Puttin' it up on (?) 
 Just take that (?) up outta your vocab 
 You so bad 
 Tell the world that you can, can 
 Little man, man

 We go way too hard 
 Y'all niggas still in cars 
 But limit the galaxy (?)

 To the bottom the (?) they grabbin' me 
 Let 'em know, straight face

 Keep 'em beneath me mate 
 Keepin' the heat, niggas is creepin', I gotta keep the (?)

 And they don't wanna see Kray high, so high, I'm scraping the sky 
 Bone, Bone, Bone, Bone

 Just like I keep my gun on me, I keep my hustle on 
 I know that I worked the night wrong 
 But (?) song

 Currency 
 I finna reach for the stars, but don't you hurry me 
 Currently 
 The future of this music starts to worry me 
 That's all y'all, all y'all, all y'all 
 Cannabis Sativa

 Tell me how far is that you see 
 I'm in another galaxy 
 (?) then I'm gonna beam you up then back down, check this reality 
 Stackin' for my four dose of ambition that's ammunition 
 That click and that clack don't stop us that drug got cookin' in the kitchen 
 How many pounds a day? 
 Maybe get (?) 
 Y'all heard but the sound like (?) 
 Y'all fuck around, they don't play 
 Everyday, it's a special occasion 
 Everyday, it's a celebration 
 Everyday, a brand new creation 
 Everyday, got a brand new hater 
 Rewind, rewind

 Do the most, do the most 
 Never told you, I'd never think loose 
 Never dig loose 
 Now she's due 
 And if it comes 'round (?) 
 Stand in my way, and I'm a show how we do it, do it 
 (?) don't play, no (?) leave 'em all clueless 
 I do this, do this (?) I say that's foolish 
 (?) then prove it
