Wiz Khalifa: 
 Clear the run way baby 
 I get money from Sunday to Sunday lady 
 Oh behave I'm young, rich famous 
 Grindin keep my pockets on Schwarzenegger 
 O.G in my swisher so my blunt taste flavored, don't it? 
 Y'all niggas can get if you want it 
 Tryna catch a flight 
 I'm in the back seat playing X box, car service just chillin' 
 Burners in the wall money all through the ceiling 
 And Spitta on the phone, tell my Dawg that we killin' 
 These fuckin' blogs, they love a star and I'm flashin' 
 Life just like a movie 
 No casting, Ask if 
 The game been kinda slow but I'm treat it like a Ashton 
 Pedal to the medal I'm mashin' 
 All we know is big money, medical weed, and fashion 
 So, try your best to imagine 
 Bro 
 I'm rollin' up another one 
 Starring out this window, window, window, windowwww 
 They tellin' me to change how I'm livin', but it's all I know 
 You see me in every city on my way out to another one, another one, another one, another ooonne 
 You find me anywhere that paper go, go, oh, oh, oh 
 Curren$y: 
 Bong rips 
 Double S's with the floor shift 
 Windows 20/20 clear 
 Peep the 20's on the rear 
 Order the car service 
 If I feel as though I don't want steer 
 Bitches freeze in the Zenon head lights, like a deer 
 But not out of fear, she lookin' cause its money over here 
 Shine from above these land lovers I'm a chandelier 
 My girl gotta pocket bubbler in her purse 
 She keep it G and pack the bowl with weed and let me hit it first 
 Ain't tryna be a hogg, dawgy all I want is what I'm worth 
 80 days, 80 stages baby all around the earth 
 Amazing race for the paper you suckas eattin' dirt 
 Chew some orbit gum, brush your teeth and scrape your tongue 
 Fresh as they come, second to none 
 Pretty woman flirt 
 Batting eye lashes they need guidance 
 Lace 'em up like my new balance 
 And keep flyin' 
 The closest that you lames ever came 
 To the planes was a palm pilot 
 I'm rollin' up another one 
 Starring out this window, window, window, windowwww 
 They tellin' me to change how I'm livin', but it's all I know 
 You see me in every city on my way out to another one, another one, another one, another ooonne 
 You find me anywhere that paper go, go, oh, oh, oh
