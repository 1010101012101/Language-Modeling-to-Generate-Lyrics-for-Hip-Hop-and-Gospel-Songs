Niggaz know 
 Taylor game sunshine or snow 
 Them hoes running their best clothes 
 And I prolly fucked your bitch nigga 
 Real shit 
 We never low 
 Away we go 
 We suppose to go go 
 We suppose to go go 
 We never low 
 Away we go 
 Like we supposed to go go 
 I always keep one rolled 
 I keep one rolled 
 I keep one rolled 
 I keep one rolled 
 I keep one rolled 
 In the cut, in the cut, roll them doobies up 
 In the cut, in the cut, roll them doobies up 
 In the cut, in the cut, roll them doobies up 
 In the cut, in the cut, roll them doobies up 
 Wake up bake up 
 Gotta get my cake up 
 In the cut, in the cut, roll them doobies up 
 Choked out loced out blowing hella smoke out 
 In the cut, in the cut, roll them doobies up 
 Rolling all this weed I am holding 
 Thinking she high before before she get the chance to smoke it 
 Blowing o's she knows my dreams potent 
 Man at home you living for the moment 
 Coming for the game, I run it, I own it 
 Kush and oj be the components 
 Come to my crib see money so big you can't fold it 
 This is how I live 
 She poured her a lil gin 
 Then order her another due 
 Before she was finished man freaky got super lubed 
 Show money 
 Leaving show car low full of hoes for me 
 Hahaha 
 It's so funny 
 All the paper chasing case the money run from me 
 In the cup rolling up 
 Keep the beezy waters stuffed 
 While a lil nigga still smoking hella blunts 
 What? 
 I just made use another plane 
 And poured us some champagne 
 As soon as we finished she was screaming out taylor game
