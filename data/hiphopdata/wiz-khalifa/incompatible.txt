(2nd verse) 
 She say I'm on some shit 
 'Cause I don't be at home 
 She hold her daddy down 
 When I be on the road 
 Gotta get this money 
 So I gotta do these shows 
 She text me every day 
 But I don't even call 
 Or respond, got the nerve to say that I don't do you wrong 
 Look at my picture every time you hear my song 
 I tell you all the time, I get it too gutter 
 Should of listened to your girls, you can do better 
 I'm gone when you need me, busy when you're alone 
 Its hard to believe me when I'm in the studio 
 Groupie hoes on a nigga, follow anywhere he go
