 Club couches, gold digging hoes hounding 
 Wishing to wake up in one of our houses 
 'Cause we got it, they want it, high end shopping on Rodeo 
 Bags, boxes being carried, they wishing we was married 
 Yacht party, I suggested she wear no socks with her Sperrys 
 Choppin' vulgar and proper over vodka and cranberry 
 She wasn't offended, she was all the way with it 
 Said she rolling with me 'cause she know I'm going for the millions

 Let's go, hold it in and don't let go 
 Diamonds frozen up, pockets swollen up 
 I been rolling up since I was old enough 
 Niggas wanna talk about us, nigga what about timing 
 Niggas wanna talk about luck, nigga what about grindin' 
 I'm baking wherever I want, I'm paid so my trunk in the front 
 Make in a day what you make in a month 
 Got a lot of cash so a nigga gon' stunt 
 Spend it on grass, Spitta rolling one up 
 Yea we live fast but the main thing is trust 
 T.G.O.D., keep gin in a cup, get in where you fit in, I'm winning

 Twisting up sour, living in a tower 
 In a double S Impala, horse power 
 Girls follow, recognize and seek guidance on counting dollars 
 High on top a money mountain, never coming down it 
 Looking for a G, capital, well you found it 
 Green back, stacks, overseas his accounts is 
 She know all about it, mama ain't stupid 
 She know this her time and she about to choose him
