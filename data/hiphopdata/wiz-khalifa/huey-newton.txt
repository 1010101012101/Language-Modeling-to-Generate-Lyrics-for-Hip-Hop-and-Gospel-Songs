Fast livin', Good weed, Bad women, 
 Rollin' up joints wit hash in 'em. 
 True pot head, do everything last minue. 
 Not concerned wit the cash I'm spendin 
 Because the cash I get it 
 Groupies fall through an crash wit us 
 Watch movies, laugh 
 Go in they bag and smoke they last wit us 
 Bongs, bowls, vapors, gas masks and stuff 
 Niggas know we the shit, cameras flash on us 
 Roll the grass up, bottles on chill, fill ya glass up 
 Niggas losin they bitches soon as they glance, 
 'Cause they know the difference between the small time business 
 And the enterprise my nigga 
 Ain't been gone, its just been a while my nigga 
 Battery strong, I'm energized my nigga 
 I'm tryin' to ball, you playin' a game. 
 Haters sayin' I changed, I say look at my chain MAANNEEE 
 Why they hate me boy 
 I'm just goin' hard cause its out there for us 
 Now I'm all in they faces, 'cause I'm on the road 
 Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone 
 Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone 
 Now they gotta talk about me when I'm gone
