See a nigga well know for switchin states, mackin broads, gettin' cake 
 Clockin mags, cock and blast, on a bitch nigga for the quick escape 
 I move with the dudes that be dishin weight, 
 Smooth with the uz that will hit your face, 
 Came in the game, 
 And I'm changin the game, with a flow that'll run around the crews that hate 
 This guy is a pimp and you know this fam, I don't hold the grams of a colder man 
 And I do it for the youngins and the older fans, 
 Niggas whippin in the kitchen just to hold the gram 
 I don't play around, lay 'em down, for the little homie wanna play the clown 
 I came to pounce, spray your rounds, 
 Follow a nigga, cause its goin' down 
 Money in a rubber band, slangin crack rock 
 So you did it round a man with a flat top, 
 Ask anyone in the streets, everyone around know wiz a beast 
 And I'm killin' a beef you could chill on the team, pull the steal and relase, 
 I'm up in your brain, you bet on me takin' a loss, you better be cuffin yo chain. 
 See this guy here is a nuisance, you talk fly and can't prove it 
 You just lie up in your music, send my guys to come and shoot shit 
 Duke I ride, and this as true as you will die if niggas pullin 
 I don't know what you fuckin' see 
 When its well know that y'all can't see me 
 P-I, T-T-S, B-U, R-G-H, 
 Represent to the fullest and I'm puttin' cowards back in the place, 
 When I"m rappin' their taste, 
 They ain't crackin' a place, laugh in your face, lay up and chill, after you say, 
 That's a mistake, 
 'Cause I'm all over a gang of ill guys lookin' like their lives out of date. 
 So why you say? cause my nigga, I could die today, 
 Knock down, never see the light of day, 
 Get in that chest and I hide away, 
 So I never give the cats a ride away, 
 Fire inside that made the kid move through the fools on the right to take the game, 
 Back to the time of the rhymin age, came back for the fact that guys are fakin, 
 I can't even believe you can spit, shit to the people I get, 
 Chips and just leave you with kids, that leave you see through your bricks, 
 Hear my shit and overdose, sold you rope and sold some coke, 
 Moved some crack how true is that, front on my cats you'll lose your back, 
 Finna get stacks till I'm through with rap, and I've been on my tracks with truth in fact, 
 Killin' 'em all, wacks, and I'm movin cats, with a crew in all black, ya I'm doin' that 
 I gotta flavor that will fuck with your taste, and imma do it till I'm blue in the face 
 I think 'n' figure that any nigga that thinkin' that he pullin the place, 
 Is gonna need to have a tool on his waste.
