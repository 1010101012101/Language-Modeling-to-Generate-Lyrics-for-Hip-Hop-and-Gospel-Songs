10 steps ahead of these niggas, fool 
 That's why they fuck wit me instead of these niggas YEA! 
 Hahaha, yeah, this beat go perfect with my belt 
 Haha It match my Damiere luggage too 
 Joints rolled up, ask Louis Vuitton 
 Uh, bad bitches and cold drinks 
 You know what it is man, Taylor Gang 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 No joint roaches in my car 
 Play the game smart 
 We gone get this cheese 
 Don't give police a reason to fuck us off 
 I done seen the ups 
 Not a stranger to the downs 
 But for now we're smoke devers in my loft 
 Champagne with bitches with foreign names 
 My homie hit me on the text 
 He want nothin' just to tell me that I got next 
 And keep it G 
 I'm in your town frequently 
 Got the bottle, bring the trees 
 Watch some movies hit this weed 
 Yeah a nigga livin' care free 
 Please Don't blow my fly pardon the high nigga tendencies 
 And duplicate us but the planes but they pretend to be 
 Through all the bullshit overcame and still remained a G 
 Clicquot (CLEE-CO) slow and sour D's smoke 
 She leave the room, you smell it on her fingers bro 
 Askin silly questions, bout where you been 
 Saying you look different 
 Had the time of her life not to mention 
 You ain't been this high in a minute 
 Took ownership over the air 
 I'm fly, You niggas just trying to visit 
 Yeah... Yeah bitch 
 Where ever that paper go, 
 I'm goin' get it, So mommy are you wit it 
 I gotta know, 
 We in the spotlight 
 Never been high as you are until you get on my flight 
 Up and the way we go 
 On my plane, momma they know my name 
 Everywhere that we go, 
 And they rep the gang everywhere that we go 
 Everywhere that we go, 
 Ohoh 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 While you at home on twitter tryna hack in her page and shit 
 We smoking and crackin' jokes at how lame you is, UH 
 Hotel room right a by the water even taught her how to use a joint roller 
 A tight end became from underground like a oiler 
 Here like I never left back like a spoiler 
 Give my keys to valet, waiter take my order 
 Y'all been waitin for real niggas to eat the way they oughta 
 Kyleon 
 (Killa Kyleon) 
 Me and Khalifa, cooler than kush reefer 
 Good drink that'll seat ya 
 Put you in a sleeper 
 Louis on my beepers but I see that bread (clearly tho) 
 Good music is the consequence we legends (really tho) 
 Minus Kanye, but we got this money in common 
 We get it day and night 
 Could've married to it no woman. 
 I'm the shit, no bummin 
 Money talk, no hummin 
 Put the GPS on it, Locate it, I'm commin 
 I'm in somethin' paper plate it, 
 Get it, decapitate it 
 And if the bomb creams 
 Super boats swangs fascinated 
 With the fast life 
 Haters to the left I got my cash right 
 Irish spring green make 'em blow it like a bag pipe 
 Get up like a flashlight 
 VVS's is in my necklace lookin' like bad dikes 
 All my bitches bad like 
 Mike no homo, Amber Rose, Kim Kardash type 
 5 star chicks, first class like my last flight. 
 Where ever that paper go, 
 I'm goin' get it, So mommy are you wit it 
 I gotta know, 
 We in the spotlight 
 Never been high as you are until you get on my flight 
 Up and the way we go 
 On my plane, momma they know my name 
 Everywhere that we go, 
 And they rep the gang everywhere that we go 
 Everywhere that we go, 
 Ohoh
