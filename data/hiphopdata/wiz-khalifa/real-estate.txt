Ugh 
 Y'all already know what it is man 
 If they wanna know my name, they look up and see the gang 
 Ugh, it's not a problem, we spending change 
 Got the pedal to the medal when I pull up out the garage 
 They feelin' 'em at all, these niggas a mirage 
 Handling my biz like a full body of massage, hands on 
 Niggas gon hate, hoes wanna menage 
 Cops fuck wit me hopin to get a charge 
 Hoes leaving their man, fuckin' us cause our cars 
 If its one thing I know, its smokin' and living large 
 Got me speedin down the interstate 
 See what I'm eatin, wanna piece up off my dinner plate 
 Hey she fuckin' me cause how I win a race 
 Plus I ain't cheap, I roll the reefer counting bigger cake 
 Wait I'm talkin' fast car, big estate 
 Money come in cash plus in the bank 
 Nigga don't believe me, throw it in your face 
 Bitch I'm in the building like real estate 
 They say I'm still the same 
 You know it ain't a thang 
 Besides the zip code, ain't a damn thang changed 
 I'm gettin' money, keep the champaigne coming 
 Might crack a smile but ain't a damn thang funny, no, no, uh ha 
 I'm straight, when you gettin' money muthafukas gonna hate 
 Find the baddest bitch and get her number, 
 I don't even call her (call her, call her) 
 Feel like a million dollars 
 When they make it, 
 They should put my face up on a million dollar bill 
 Dollar bill, dollar bill 
 Cause that's how I feel yup 
 Cause that's how I feel yup 
 Cause that's how I feel yup 
 Cause that's how I feel yup 
 When they make it, 
 They should put my face up on a million dollar bill 
 Dollar bill, dollar bill 
 Cause that's how I feel yup 
 Cause that's how I feel yup 
 Cause that's how I feel yup 
 Cause that's how I feel yup 
 Hey 
 Ballin's not a hobby, it's my occupation 
 Hoes on my dick, that's my confirmation 
 Couple stars with me, that's a constelation 
 Jacksons, Grants, Benjys, that's my conversation 
 Touch the pedal once, it look like I'm racing 
 Eyes Chinese, smoke like I'm jamacian, 
 V.I.P rollin' doobies up and face it 
 12 bottles of Rose, I'm on some gang shit 
 Gettin' all the shit, cake crumblin 
 Ain't nothin', told them lil niggas I take from 'em 
 Laughin' my all the way to the bank 
 Tried to talk but they can't 
 They just stand there when they starin' 
 Hatin', mumblin, 
 What you make a year, I guarantee I spend it clubbin 
 Started kinda hot, now its safe to say we bubblin 
 400 on a zip, blow it all day 
 Another city, state, another mill to make
