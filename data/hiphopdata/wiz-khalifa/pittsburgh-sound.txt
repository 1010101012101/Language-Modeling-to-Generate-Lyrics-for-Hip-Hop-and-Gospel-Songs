Yeah 
 It's Wiz Khalifa man 
 It's that 412 
 I got that Pittsburgh Sound 
 Around these parts 
 I'm known as the youngest in charge 
 My shit bang out the trunk of your car 
 It's the cities known rap spitta 
 Semi blown clack niggas 
 Skin and bones but really known as that nigga 
 I'm known to chase the bucks 
 Grind to get my paper up 
 In the studio writin rhymes till the paper crunch 
 I'm not the type that you would call 'em a thug 
 But I'm a huster it's all in my blood 
 So if it's all for the cheese then I'm in it 
 My screws kinda loose so I ease to the finish 
 I hop up in the coupe feel the breeze while I'm in it 
 Blowin' smoke up out the roof from the trees that I'm spliffin 
 Youngin got the game on lock 
 I'm on top it's a shame y'all not 
 You a lame put your brain on pot 
 Leave you wet like the rain y'all drop 
 I'm gon rock and I ain't gon stop 
 Who's the kid spittin' flames 
 Changin the game 
 His name, it's Wiz Khalifa man 
 From the home of the greats 
 Where they known for the cake 
 The place, that steel city damn 
 I got that Pittsburgh sound 
 And I'mma always hold Pittsburgh down 
 It's Wiz Khalifa man 
 You can't tell by now 
 Pittsburgh I'mma swell my town 
 That steel city damn 
 Roll rubber you don't know who you dealin' with 
 Oh so innocent but flows so diligent 
 My spit game's like a 44 killin' shit 
 Know your man warm but the young ball killin' shit 
 Realist shit and your main wife dig me 
 Game try and hit me 
 Kick game like 50 Cent 
 Niggas wanna play games I quickly 
 Mob with a squad that will bang out wit me 
 And they want the kid still hurtin' 
 Hundred niggas wit hammers 
 Yeah, that's what I call a steal curtain 
 I handle my time and still work it 
 Put in work couple mill worth in 
 And I'm from Pittsburgh where the green 
 And the eatin is good 
 And the fiends do everything in the hood 
 Everyday is like a war so my soldiers ride fatigues in the hood 
 And we gettin' all the green like we should... You know, yeah 
 Who's the kid spittin' flames 
 Changin the game 
 His name, it's Wiz Khalifa man 
 From the home of the greats 
 Where they known for the cake 
 The place, that steel city damn 
 I got that Pittsburgh sound 
 And I'mma always hold Pittsburgh down 
 It's Wiz Khalifa man 
 You can't tell by now 
 Pittsburgh I'mma swell my town 
 That steel city damn 
 I'm from the home and the place 
 Where they known for the cake 
 Where the money stackin up, 
 Put a chrome to your face 
 You can step outta line, and get thrown into place 
 That's why all my homies say 
 It's whatever whenever 
 Mother fucker I flow so hard and I spit so sick 
 That all of these rap niggas on my tip 
 Like pause it ain't none of that homo shit 
 And that's word to the philly ass spliff 
 Yeah 
 Who's the kid spittin' flames 
 Changin the game 
 His name, it's Wiz Khalifa man 
 From the home of the greats 
 Where they known for the cake 
 The place, that steel city damn 
 I got that Pittsburgh sound 
 And I'mma always hold Pittsburgh down 
 It's Wiz Khalifa man 
 You can't tell by now 
 Pittsburgh I'mma swell my town 
 That steel city damn
