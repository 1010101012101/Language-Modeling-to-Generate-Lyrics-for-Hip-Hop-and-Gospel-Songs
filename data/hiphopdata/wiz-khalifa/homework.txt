I been in my zone (I been in my zone) 
 I just wanna know (I just wanna know) 
 Why you left me in the cold (why you left me in the cold) 
 Now you're blowin' up my phone (now you're blowin' up my phone) 
 Only when I get that check, you wanna call me 
 Every other night, you go and pop a molly 
 People think your nice, but girl your really naughty 
 I hate (?), I had to tell him you're a thotty 
 You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that 
 When I roll the dice, you see, I get double that 
 Every time I shoot, it's like DeRosen, it goes in 
 Thought I took a shit on you, but girl, you are not chosen 
 You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that 
 When I roll the dice, you see, I get double that 
 Every time I shoot, it's like DeRosen, it goes in 
 Thought I took a shit on you, but girl, you are not chosen 
 Uh, got all the papers rolled 
 Used to be Backwoods, now it's cones 
 Fuck a DM, I'm slidin' through your home 
 You sendin' them pics to my phone 
 You like that I'm well known 
 But still be hella vo 
 On point, your friends ain't gotta know 
 Don't go tellin' 'em 'bout my stroke 
 She might want to find out 
 Ain't nothin' new, this happens all the time 
 Pressure break pipes, hit me late night 
 Ain't the gang, it ain't right, yeah 
 You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that 
 When I roll the dice, you see, I get double that 
 Every time I shoot, it's like DeRosen, it goes in 
 Thought I took a shit on you, but girl, you are not chosen 
 You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that 
 When I roll the dice, you see, I get double that 
 Every time I shoot, it's like DeRosen, it goes in 
 Thought I took a shit on you, but girl, you are not chosen 
 Finally free, high off the tree 
 Nigga had a lockdown, she was under siege 
 Wanna be flyin' places and smokin' in peace 
 On the runnin' team with my own machine 
 They ain't comin' close, that's why you puttin' on your clothes 
 And rushin' out the door when it's over 
 Nowhere near sober, nigga say he need closure 
 I just throw another pound your way and hope 
 That when I see you you'll know how to raw 
 Gang or rang, nothing at all 
 You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that 
 When I roll the dice, you see, I get double that 
 Every time I shoot, it's like DeRosen, it goes in 
 Thought I took a shit on you, but girl, you are not chosen 
 You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that 
 When I roll the dice, you see, I get double that 
 Every time I shoot, it's like DeRosen, it goes in 
 Thought I took a shit on you, but girl, you are not chosen 
 I was born a star 
 It's gang or nothin' at all 
 Got your bitch try'na FaceTime the call 
 Heh heh heh
