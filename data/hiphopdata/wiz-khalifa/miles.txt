I met you through your best friend 
 I was on the roll and you said 
 I sing all your favorite songs 
 My room was in the west inn 
 Drive was even close 
 Be there soon as I drop the t-shirt off 
 I'll be waiting 
 This one night special for you 
 Ima make it worth it baby 
 Ima do somethin' extra for you, for you 
 And you don't even gotta do it back 
 That's a gift 
 A present 
 You made this trip excellent 
 The best it could have ever went 
 Wrestling, lettin all your worries go 
 Feelin' like you'll never stress again 
 Hopefully they're can be a us again, us again, us again, 
 But if not then fuck it then 
 Nah I'm playin', you're my die and wish bucket list 
 Thinking about you every time I'm with my other chick 
 This o.t? fling 
 My outta town girl 
 We don't need bros? 
 We in our own world
