Mhm 
 Let me talk to you 
 Show you something that you probably seen before, but you never seen it like this 
 Physically fit, smoking that shit you can't get 
 If it don't make dollars, then well it don't make sense 
 Got my crib out in Cali, buy everything for my kid 
 You hear me talk about it, fuckin' right, it's what I live 
 Lean back, hit the chronic 
 She like "Why it so intense?" 
 I say don't "Don't worry 'bout it, keep your mind up on these chips" 
 And these niggas out plotting 
 They broke so they got something against us 
 Pot, we smoke it anywhere 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Don't get to a comfortable point 
 And back off 
 Gotta be sharp, the game's filled with whack artists 
 I ain't hating on you dawg, get yours 
 But don't ever think I'm convinced 
 These eyes covered by lenses 
 'Cause I'm probably high as your rent 
 See the Forbes list, think it got him content 
 But I'm not, I'm still hustling hard 
 Won't let my paper stop 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw 
 I want some of that damn KK man 
 Some of that Khalifa Kush, man 
 Y'all niggas smoking OG Kush 
 I want Khalifa Kush, man 
 For'real 
 The one with that man name on it, man 
 For'real man, I'm tryna inhale that one time, man 
 For'real
