Turn me up a little bit mark 
 Yeah 
 It's Yong Khalifa man 
 Star Power 
 Taylor Gang or Die 
 Its Star year get used to it 
 Yup 
 Feel like the sky is the limit 
 And nothin' come easy you gotta grind till you get it 
 They say the star life is addictive 
 And me I'm so high I'm flying defying physics 
 I'm wearing hundred dollar draws no flaws 
 Wizzle on the hands free 
 Call young boss 
 Blackberry ringin' 
 Sidekick buzzin got my money right can't tell me nothin' 
 If I said I wasn't all in 
 I'd be lyin' like a lady whos fallin' 
 Chain sick and the watch face swollen 
 See me now wish id go back to the old him 
 But Wizzle wont change for the world 
 I live life fast any day could be your last 
 Blow ten stacks then go 'n' get it back in a hour 
 That's what the fuck I call Star Power lets go 
 They say you get out what you put in to it 
 So my alls what I give 
 And now I don't jus talk about the life of a star 
 Homie that's what I live 
 And the niggas that I'm wit husstle heavy 
 In your city, every state wit my Taylor Gang family 
 They say you get out what you put in to it 
 So my alls what I give 
 And now I don't jus talk about the life of a star 
 Homie that's what I live 
 And the niggas that I'm wit husstle heavy 
 In your city, every state wit my Taylor Gang family 
 Yuup 
 This good livin' got me open 
 Make you fell like you took a hit of what I'm smokin' 
 The high life 
 Yeah that's my life 
 And it's possible to die twice 
 But you only live once 
 So ima live it up 
 Pop bottle after bottle rollin' kush filled blunts 
 I feel like I've been chosen 
 And I don't fix it if its broken 
 I buy a new one 
 The way I blow hundreds 
 Make people say they sholdve never gave niggas money 
 If you was me I guarantee you'd do the same thing 
 Cop anything when you want it 
 They say fames the most dangerous drug 
 I played wit now I can't get enough 
 And came up a customer 
 But now I'm the supplier 
 And that's what I call star power lets go
