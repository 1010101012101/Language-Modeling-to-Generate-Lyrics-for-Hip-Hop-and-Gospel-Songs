 Rapping ass nigga 
 There go Wiz, he a rapping ass nigga 
 I'm in a Benz getting brain from a centrepiece 
 Before you can mention my name you need ten at least 
 I know they hate cause of the paper that a nigga see 
 Light a J and say a prayer for my enemies, yeah 
 Made men bunch of made ass niggas 
 When you paid then you with some paid ass niggas 
 I heard that money grow on trees so I grew one 
 Left my old bitch at home got a new one 
 Said that I quit drinking but I'm back at it 
 I said that I quit drinking but I'm back at it 
 Your bitch leaving with us nigga that's tragic 
 The roof go in the trunk, that's magic 
 She rolling weed and she don't even smoke 
 Come to your job and make it flood bet you gon' need a boat 
 (Let's do it) 
 I'm 20 years in and I still win 
 Hanging with the Taylors drinking gin and I'm dancing 
 Sunday I will ride the Bugatti, Monday I ride Benz 
 Any chick and all of her friends you know I'm tossing 
 Money spent (you know it), little money folded (you know it) 
 You got one crib (you know it), Juicy got 4 (you know it) 
 Only clubs that I like gotta have poles (you know it) 
 Only fuck with model chick, but I play with hoes (you know it) 
 My mansion sitting on forty acres, who the neighbours? 
 Kobe Bryant from the Lakers, now that's paper (let's get it) 
 And I still mob through the hood I don't need no waivers (yes sir) 
 'Cause if you niggas getting wrong, I'ma see you later (Blowww)
