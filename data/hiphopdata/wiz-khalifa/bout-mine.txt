You know what's on my mind 
 And why I'm always on the grind 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 Young Khalifa's the name 
 Plus you gonna remember one thing 
 That I'm 'bout mine 
 That I'm 'bout mine 
 [??] Do what you do 
 Haters: you do what you do 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 What we do in the game 
 [??] Doin' a damn thing 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 [??] The youngest in charge 
 Known for the hottest in rap 
 Straight from the top of the map 
 Yes, I'm a popular cat 
 Been to the pits of The Burgh 
 To the left, cocked as my hat 
 Wiz keep a spliff for the herb 
 Niggas with knots full of stacks 
 And I ain't talkin' to cats 
 I'm overdosin your brain 
 Go for the dope in this game 
 Broke when the flow is insane 
 I'm like the, young Shaq of rap 
 (??) 
 (??) 
 Man, I'm controlling the game 
 And I'm bout mine 
 Tell you on your grind 
 But it's about time 
 Outshine haters so the paper 
 Begin to mount right 
 Bout mine 
 Lay it down, homie you'll get out-rhymed 
 On the track, or flat on your back, you'll get out-lined 
 Keep the goonies with me 
 Never leave the crib without mine 
 And no I ain't talkin' ya game 
 When I say I'm bout shines 
 I'm talkin' dollars, guy 
 Here's what you should follow by, 
 Young [??], dumb hat, hand a nigga bout mine [unsure about line?????] 
 You know what's on my mind 
 And why I'm always on the grind 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 Young Khalifa's the name 
 Plus you gonna remember one thing 
 That I'm 'bout mine 
 That I'm 'bout mine 
 [??] Do what you do 
 Haters: you do what you do 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 What we do in the game 
 [??] Doin' a damn thing 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 See, I'm a boss to you cats 
 And here my job is to rap 
 Spittin' flame to make ya damn sho you lames fall to the back 
 It's a shame I'm here now, so for your squad it's a wrap 
 It's the gritty-city that strong-armed onto the map 
 More than a rapper, in fact 
 Man, you fuckin' with the finest here 
 The best one that's rhymin' here 
 So I guess I'm a pioneer 
 No question, I'm fly as air 
 I'm high, but I'm sittin' low 
 A blast 
 So if you niggas gotta ask, then your bitch'll know 
 Sicker flow 
 Short change nigga 
 You need bigga dough 
 You recall that moment, 
 Shit I'm a bigger picture, pro 
 You niggas simply spendin chips on these pros 
 I'd be right to call you a pimp 
 'Cause your niggas is hos 
 You see me a little different 
 Though you [??] for these hos 
 I had them pigeons in my crib 
 Just washin dishes and clothes 
 You know it's 
 The young wise-guy 
 Grind with my eyes wide 
 I [??] stop to rewind 
 [??] Ahead of my time 
 You know what's on my mind 
 And why I'm always on the grind 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 Young Khalifa's the name 
 Plus you gonna remember one thing 
 That I'm 'bout mine 
 That I'm 'bout mine

 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 What we do in the game 
 [??] Doin' a damn thing 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 'Cause I'm 'bout mine 
 If you talk chores 
 Never let another nigga doubt yours 
 Life is full of lessons and them blessings, 
 Better count yours 
 Watch out for the haters 
 'Cause your paper's what they out for 
 Be a boss, 
 Not just another loss to account for 
 And the flow, shit 
 You know Wiz gonna split line-for-line 
 And this nigga get so rich 
 Gonna hold shit 
 And I keep tellin' you time-and-time 
 Again, [??] and [??] focused 
 Movin' so quick 
 Slow up
