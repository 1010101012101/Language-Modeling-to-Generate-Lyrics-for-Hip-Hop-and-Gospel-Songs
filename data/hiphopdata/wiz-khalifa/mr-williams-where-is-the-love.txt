Don't fear 
 Just love me out into the moonlight 
 Shine on your body 
 So bright yeah 
 Your beauty's turning 
 Baby, turn around 
 My sight's alright 
 In the night, I'm in my zone 
 You gonna regret this if you don't smoke 
 Let's get in love here 
 Let's get in love here 
 Let's get in love here, babe 
 I'm fresh off the dank, got more to bake 
 Never running out same goes for the bank 
 Gas in the tank, top rank 
 About the cake, we don't use brakes 
 Too blazed, pilots say we can't get on the plane 
 No debate, pounds are putting on, I'm making weight 
 Money safe, put it in there for a rainy day 
 Niggas hate, don't fuck with them anyway 
 I hustle too many wraiths to get comfortable 
 You know how I'm coming 
 Call your girl, let's get into something 
 Money discussions, take my time, I ain't rushing 
 What's someone you could trust in 
 Me, I'ma fuck, and get up in the dusk 
 Got work tomorrow that's two of us 
 I feel like I can't lose 
 KK joints till I can't move 
 She happy I came through 
 Giving rolling lessons to a crew 
 Smoke like the Dude 
 No lie, we the truth 
 So high, leave the room, gang 
 Don't fear 
 Just love me out into the moonlight 
 Shine on your body 
 So bright yeah 
 Your beauty's turning 
 Baby, turn around 
 My sight's alright 
 In the night, I'm in my zone 
 You gonna regret this if you don't smoke 
 Let's get in love here 
 Let's get in love here 
 Let's get in love here, babe 
 Big money ended up count me out 
 Burying safes with undisclosed amounts 
 They all over the place 
 Plus I fuck with the banks 
 I got a couple accounts 
 She got a million dollar mouth 
 She was born with it 
 Plus went to the dock of Miami for the rest of the chips 
 Stacked out, renegade on the Vegas strip 
 But she pay me for the game I gave the bitch 
 A level headed gentleman with a crazy wrist 
 Boss player, thirty points plus twenty assists 
 I'm not selfish 'cause I throw all my niggas in the mix 
 Don't cuff none 
 Introduce my homie to the bitch if she want some 
 Chick will come through, get done, spend money, bang bitches but I don't love one 
 Hustle till the cars come Ferrari, drive out run 
 Pull up, hop out 
 Car stunts I've done 
 Don't fear 
 Just love me out into the moonlight 
 Shine on your body 
 So bright yeah 
 Your beauty's turning 
 Baby, turn around 
 My sight's alright 
 In the night, I'm in my zone 
 You gonna regret this if you don't smoke 
 Let's get in love here 
 Let's get in love here 
 Let's get in love here 
 Let's get in love here, babe 
 Tapping fools out, bruising as far as 'bout 
 I ain't searching for clout, bringing cars out 
 Large amounts of money, guard the vaults 'cause we stars 
 Chase paper, smoke strong 
 All my bitches get along, well informed 
 What's your nigga doing 
 Cut your phone off it's you in the (?) 
 Said he bored, ain't important 
 True color showing 
 My whip look comfortable, don't it 
 Keep them papers rolling, don't see my opponents 
 Stay focused 
 Don't fear 
 Just love me out into the moonlight 
 Shine on your body 
 So bright yeah 
 Your beauty turning 
 Baby, turn around 
 My sight's alright 
 In the night, I'm in my zone 
 You gonna regret this if you don't smoke 
 Let's get in love here 
 Let's get in love here 
 Let's get in love here, babe 
 Hit me up-up, up-up, yeah 
 Hit me up-up, up-up, yeah 
 Diamond rings, Diamond chains 
 Diamond on everything 
 Spend some quarters, drop a chain 
 Hop on to a private plane 
 Pay the cost to be the boss 
 Now I need some time to floss 
 I hear'em, don't believe them tho 
 Paper, I just get and go 
 Making conversation, problems facing 
 Not them niggas, run away 
 I keep a nice long Jag' 
 It's no police so I'ma blaze it 
 I'm taking niggas out the waste 
 Always rolling up, my killing 
 Try to get another million in my safe 
 Said they'll be there when you need 'em 
 But I just don't see them, where's the love 
 And if you down for me, I'll be right there 
 When you need me, hit me up 
 Said they'll be there when you need 'em 
 But I just don't see her, where's the love 
 And if you down for me, I'll be right there 
 When you need me, hit me up 
 Couple bangs, popping 
 Got a couple chain options 
 Looks like rain drops in every ring that I'm rocking 
 Nigga want me falling off but nigga we ain't stopping 
 Always hit the mark, 'cause I know how to stay in pocket 
 Now they stare, mind is clear 
 I seen yours, mine is rare 
 Money long, not a care 
 Blowing strong, diamond shared 
 When I'm home, I'm the mayor 
 Rims gold, like a player 
 Really cold rocking carats 
 Said they'll be there when you need 'em 
 But I just don't see them, where's the love 
 And if you down for me, I'll be right there 
 When you need me, hit me up 
 Said they'll be there when you need 'em 
 But I just don't see her, where's the love 
 And if you down for me, I'll be right there 
 When you need me, hit me up
