All about my money if your not I'll see you later 
 I take out the first two letters and say ha ha to you haters 
 I got rooms wit elevators 
 Yeah they say I'm futuristic 
 Got a iphone for business 
 But the sidekicks for the bitches 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 Stupid swaggered up niggas mad at us 
 All my niggas rep that gang 
 And my bitch, she bad as fuck 
 Hair down her back 
 Religion always true 
 My president is black 
 My head coach too ooh 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 Tatt'd like a Mexican 
 Fresher than a freshman 
 Pocket full of benjimans 
 How much ain't a question 
 Wont believe how many older women that be crushin 
 Never quick to cause a scense 
 To me it's really nothing 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 Calim your flows insane 
 But nigga's not so sick 
 Let him heat up for I eat up 
 Hope tha pot don't stick 
 And my knots don't fit 
 But my jeans do 
 Apoligize for shittin on your niggas 
 I ain't mean to 
 I see life in plain veiw 
 I'm lookin' out the window 
 Lickin' swisher tips 
 And a bitch to fluf my pillow 
 California trips got me on that different swag 
 If you ain't know who I was 
 I bet you know it now 
 Yeah 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa 
 I'm young khalifa
