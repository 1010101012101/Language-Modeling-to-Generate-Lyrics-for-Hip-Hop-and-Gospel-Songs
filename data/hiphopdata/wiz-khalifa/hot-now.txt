New bands 
 Cop one if you ain't friends 
 Papers two 
 Rolling papers two 
 I only do what gangsters do 
 Through with the basics 
 You think it's a spaceship when I ride through 
 Feel like I'm on ice, we just glide 
 Niggas is parasites 
 I get pussy in a pair of off-whites 
 Know I want, you can see it my eyes, surprise 
 'Cause I visualized it 
 Always knew I was the man 
 You just realized it 
 Don't need a detector, I can see the lies 
 I'm a different type of being 
 Drive the type of whip your bitches like to be in 
 Smoke got my eyes lookin' Korean 
 Every time that I fly, VIP'n 
 All of my nigga's ridin' 
 Two joints, that's double homicide 
 Got you rolling papers, tell me why you gettin' high? 
 We went from coppin' it to supplyin' 
 Beat the rat, the drop of a dime 
 All else fails, I can depend on mine 
 Fuck signs, my niggas gettin' high 
 Party of flies, Taylor gang or resign 
 Why you even come back to crib if you ain't stayin'? 
 Ridin' with some real niggas, know that we ain't playin' 
 Pockets on swole, you know that I keep them faces 
 Money through the roof, I just crash it and replace it 
 All my bitches bad, I don't fuck her if she basic 
 Of all niggas in the game, Khalifa man, the greatest 
 Blowin' all this money, need someone to help me save it 
 Lickin' on me all night, she said she love my flavor 
 Homie, I'm a boss baby, I don't need no favors 
 Got so many cars, I don't got room for my neighbors 
 Got a bad broad, but you know me, I might take her 
 Fuck up out here, bitch, though I'm all about my paper 
 Khalifa man will stick to the code, no I don't savor 
 Suckin' on me good, treat me like a Now and Later 
 Breakfast in the morn', we can get our dinner catered 
 Try to hit my phone, I don't pick up 'cause I'm faded 
 I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now 
 I ain't used to get it but I got it now 
 You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin' 
 Anything I want, I pull up in 
 I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now 
 I ain't used to get it but I got it now 
 You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin' 
 Anything I want, I pull up in 
 Anything I want, I pull up and stunt 
 Parking in the back, we can't do the front 
 Real n's pay the papers, a plus 
 Ain't with the gang, you can't sit with us 
 Take them bitches phones, ain't nothing, we don't trust 'em 
 Send 'em for the gangs, why they came, we don't love 'em 
 Takin' all our time, we don't need to rush 
 Smellin' like the KK, it's serious 
 Grind every day, 'cause the process I trust in 
 Think they the way, but they bluffin' 
 Baby, I can spend it all, don't care how much it's costing 
 Grind and you get all this money, 'cause it's ballin' 
 I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now 
 I ain't used to get it but I got it now 
 You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin' 
 Anything I want, I pull up in 
 I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now 
 I ain't used to get it but I got it now 
 You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin' 
 Anything I want, I pull up in 
 Two joints, that's double homicide 
 Got your bitch jumpin' in my ride 
 She with the gang and she down to fly 
 Rolling papers up and getting high
