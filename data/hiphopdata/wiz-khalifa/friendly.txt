(Curren$y Spitta) 
 'Bout the strength of the quality 
 We smell 
 You can tell that I'm somewhere in the building 
 On my batman shit 
 Niggas suspended from the ceiling 
 Not really 
 But that's the way the weed got me feeling 
 ? 
 Mami you got the vision 
 And I see it HD 
 And it couldn't be any clearer 
 You should be with Spitta 
 And you know that this your chance 
 Don't blow it like birthday candles 
 Good guy Spitta keep his name outta them scandals 
 It's not a secret 
 I prefer my girls in sneakers 
 Never sandals 
 Posing naked in only a pair of nike? 
 It's bottle pop 
 Back to back 
 Extra large 
 Cellphone, camera's out 
 Mama I remember that 
 Anytime I look at that 
 I go to wondering where you at 
 So baby where you at 
 With it 
 And I'm just tryna hi-hit it on the friendly 
 And maybe we get back up ina minute 
 Fast cars 
 Fly clothes 
 G5 flying on the seashore 
 Get in 
 Baby I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly 
 So tell me if you is 
 Or if you isn't 
 Well then 
 Yuh 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 Listen 
 If you with it 
 Get in 
 What you sippin' 
 Hit it out of the park 
 That's if you pitching 
 First you look at me wrong 
 Like uh uh no he didn't 
 Then you turn into robin on me 
 You start to give in 
 Get it 
 By the beach watchin tennis 
 Crack anotha bottle of Perrion 
 LouieV carry on's when you visit 
 Sending all them singles in yo sidekick 
 Sentence 
 Then I reply like 
 Be there in a minute 
 Just put me 'n' Curren$y on yo friendlist 
 The weed come from a village 
 Truck tire sour diesel scented 
 That's real shit 
 From smelling this she wanna see how the cigar taste 
 We litting refer bumping 808's & heartbreaks 
 Skinny broad but out them jeans she got a heart shape 
 Skip the movie date and take her to the horse race yeah 
 And bet it all on the winner 
 Young entrepreneur give you the business with it yeaaaaaaaa. 
 Fast cars 
 Fly clothes 
 G5 flying on the seashore 
 Get in 
 Baby I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly 
 So tell me if you is 
 Or if you isn't 
 Well then 
 Yuh
