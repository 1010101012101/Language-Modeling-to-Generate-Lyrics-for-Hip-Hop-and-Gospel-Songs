I must be dreamin', I must b dreamin' 
 Plus I got the cars got the cloths and the money and the hoes 
 The way I said it ain't gone change 
 I must be dreamin', I must be dreamin' 
 I wake up early in the morning to a fat blunt 
 My phone full of miss call my shit backed up 
 A flight to catch my shit packed up 
 The superstars you hear bout that's us 
 The 12 in the trunk hit like a mad truck 
 I see ur bitch is a rap like a pack lunch 
 My diamond shinning they motovating 
 I see you smiling I know you hattig 
 I'm on the road like here there and everywhere 
 In Hollywood eattin good smokeing heavy there 
 Ain't comfortable unless I got a lot of money there 
 I'm on some slusive shit got a lot of funny gear 
 Flat screen TV with no glear in them 
 All my room got kings size bed in them 
 I'm not jus talkin' 
 Lets start a seemen 
 I must be dreamin', I must be dreamin' 
 Plus I got the cars got the cloths got the money and the hoes 
 And the way I said it ain't gone change 
 I must be dreamin', I must be dreamin' 
 I got to sleep in a new city every night 
 I prey to god lookin' over me on every flight 
 A new time zone, u heard me right? 
 L.A to M.I.A I be there tonight 
 Then I'm in Diego coming with new shit 
 Eating that ruthcris right across the crue chips 
 I'm not just talking I really do this 
 My life is a movie 
 I'm making history 
 I must be dreamin', I must dreaming 
 Plus I got the car got the cloths got the money and the hoes 
 And the way I said it ain't gone change
