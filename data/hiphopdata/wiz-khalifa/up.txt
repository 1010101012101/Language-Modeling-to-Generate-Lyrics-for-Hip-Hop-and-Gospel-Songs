...I'ma run it... 
 I don't know what's going on, or about this feelin', you got me feelin', 
 'Cause every time I try to leave I'm right back again, yeah, 
 And I ain't goin' no where, you got me walkin' on the ceilin, 
 So when the times get hard and the nights your all alone, oh, 
 I'll be the one you call, no tellin' where we might go, 
 And every time you look up baby I'm right there, flyin in the air, 
 So let all of your fears gooo oh oh, you never spent the night... low...

 Roll it up and pass it all around, god dam she a keeeperrr, yeah, 
 So when the times get hard and the nights your all alone, 
 I'll be the one you callllll, no tellin' where we might go, 
 And every time you look up baby I'm right there flyin in the air, 
 So let all of your fears gooo oh oh, you never spend the night... low

 We go up up up up up up up up,
