 Imma need a whole case hit the club and pop them bottles 
 In it with my thugs spendin dubs like no tomorrow

 Saw me in the club once shawty got a crush now 
 Don't got the time got a line of sexy women 
 Wanna fuck the team 'cause they seen how we be spendin 
 Rock expensive linen ya that baggy shit is finished
