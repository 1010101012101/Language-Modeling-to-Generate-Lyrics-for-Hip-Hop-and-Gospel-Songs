Hey girl what's your name 
 I'm very very glad you came 
 Your such a beautiful thing (so beautiful) 
 Hey girl what's your sign 
 I'm very very glad you took the time 
 Your such a beautiful thing (your so beautiful and you know it) 
 Hey girl wanna let you know 
 What's going through my head while I'm staring out this window 
 But every time I try to find the words to explain, I fail 
 Hey girl heard your story before 
 Your parents don't get it and your boyfriend is an A-Hole 
 And going to work in the morning drives you insane, I know 
 So you like to kick it with the bad boys 
 Pose like your flicking for the Tabloids 
 Froze on me 'cause if you fast forward 
 I'll just be an other cool kid that you passed on 
 And no matter how hard I fell 
 Played the best way I can with the cards I'm delt 
 For the day I can say its nice to meet you 
 Wait till next time I see you, ima say 
 Hey girl what's your name 
 I'm very very glad you came 
 Your such a beautifull thing 
 Hey girl what's your sign 
 I'm very very glad you took the time 
 Your such a beautiful thing 
 Hey girl are we compatible 
 I like tarantino flicks and a long talks, I'm a vergo 
 There's so much that I think and don't get to say (about you, it's all about you baby) 
 Hey girl it's been a month or so 
 And I've been on the road singing songs flyin solo 
 When I go to sleep 
 Your the girl in my dreams 
 So I got your picture on my mac book screen 
 Savor somethin' about this age your just like me 
 Shorty got flavor like my favorite ice cream 
 And ima scoop her one day and make her life change 
 Till then I'm like dang 
 And no matter how hard I fell 
 Play the best way I can with the cards I'm delt 
 For the day I can say its nice to meet you 
 Wait till next time I see you, ima say
