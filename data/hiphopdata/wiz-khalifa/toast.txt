Yeah round we them niggas 
 You seasonal, temporary livin' 
 You're wannabe, done in a minute son 
 You are not a finit 
 Bitches could tell the difference, they know better than to smoke with ya 
 Back up a lit, bitch you'll get the whole picture 
 So much sicker than them niggas 
 I'm coughin, they just got hiccups 
 KC lights, roll bars on my Chevy pickup 
 Offroad style, leaf kid heavy do this burned stone 
 Pative, get it done 
 When the time is crunched like situps 
 To the challenge I rise, Lamborghini doors 
 85 corn ties, never seen a real road 
 From the show, round flow to my seven comp the raj 
 Got a storage cross town when lights seven mo rise 
 Touchin side, that Grand Theft Auto life 
 Rollin' up in my safe house, I'm lookin' down 
 Done it by my design 
 Refusing to compromise 
 These hazel eyes 
 These hazel eyes 
 These hazel eyes 
 These hazel eyes 
 They sayin' shit changed 'cause shit change 
 Not just the horses in my motor, but the car's for me to show up 
 I'm a boss and my whole team fly private, black cars 
 When we roll up - quarter pounds 
 When we blow up - hit the ground runnin' 
 My watch new cause a nigga sound bove it 
 And your girlfriend leaving you 'cause she just wanna be around something 
 Like playin' X-Box and wearin weed socks, beatin' round stuntin 
 Orderin thousand dollar room service, rollin' weed up out of onion 
 Uh I got atmade but I ain't make it on my own 
 Oh what about a Pittsburg nigga? 
 I'm gonna buy a LA home 
 Rollin' up papers, turning down favors 
 All these fake cushions, I got my own flavor 
 Hold me down in KKN, that brand new bread 
 Got to make to make that brand new crib 
 Need a whip to match that brand new car 
 Thinkin' maybe Maybach, brand new insides 
 Everything black, young ass nigga, blowin' OG in the back 
 Last time you heard from me I was rollin' butup 
 Lookin' dope in my brand new clothes 
 Eyes closed like someone told them to shut up 
 These hazel eyes 
 These hazel eyes 
 These hazel eyes 
 These hazel eyes
