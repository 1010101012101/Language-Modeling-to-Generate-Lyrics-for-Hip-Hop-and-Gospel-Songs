Wow 
 (Laughs) 
 It feels like I'm back again for the first time, 
 If that makes any sense 
 Sledgren 
 The good weed is lit, let's go 
 I got a couple sweets rolled at home 
 With another O in a ziploc 
 O in a Ziploc 
 They see the pockets on swoll 
 How the lights hit the stones on the wrist watch 
 Stones on the wrist watch 
 Don't gotta ask who run it it's easy baby they know my name They know my name 
 All the cash we blow on some weed smoke they say 
 Bro it's a shame (x2) 
 Boy you know it's a shame 
 Pop the smoke like pop out 
 And I'm pimp all the hoes call me papa 
 Gucci, Chuck Tays, I don't fuck with no prada 
 Fresh off the plane and I'm smoking like High time 
 It's better to be a star 
 NY I'm coping them weed jars 
 LA my hoes got medical weed cards 
 And my swag through the roof 
 I hit the mall a boutique and tear down 
 See what I got on you want to wear it now 
 Think I'm a drink on her when she get 
 Married to my money so bitch think I'm taken 
 She keep beggin me to creep 
 I heard your songs, I can do better in my sleep 
 All my niggas rumble some bang better with the heat 
 Better keep the peace 
 There's Ink everywhere you see 
 And I only smoke good weed 
 Only where designer man 
 If I fuck with baby girl, gotta be a 9 or 10 
 Swag... 
 I got a couple sweets rolled with another 
 O in a ziploc 
 O in a Ziploc 
 They see the pockets on swoll 
 How the lights hit the stones on the wrist watch 
 Stones on the wrist watch 
 Don't gotta ask who run it it's easy baby they know my name They know my name 
 All the cash we blow on some weed smoke they say 
 Bro it's a shame (x2) 
 Boy you know it's a shame 
 Last night I made a bitch forget all about her man 
 The reason for them guts in your garbage can 
 I roll expensive spliffs 
 She fuckin' me for free but for you she one expensive bitch 
 Keep blowin' up my sidekick, know I'm at the studio 
 Another couple thousand, every time I do a show 
 That meanin' I'm really eating 
 And everyday of my life is like the weekend 
 Swag! 
 I wake up to good weed and new clothes 
 Go to sleep with more money and bad hoes 
 One of my 3 phones buzzin through my sleep 
 I know you heard of my name 
 I'm buzzin all through the streets 
 Yeah... 
 And I be with bosses 
 Get your shit together nigga or count your losses 
 And in case you ain't get the portrait 
 I'ma make it clear, nigga it's star year 
 Swag! 
 Yeah Man, It shouldn't be no surprise for y'all niggaz 
 Swisher sweet flickin'
