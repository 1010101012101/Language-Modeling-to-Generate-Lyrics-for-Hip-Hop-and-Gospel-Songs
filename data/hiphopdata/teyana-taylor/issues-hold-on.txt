I do love you but it's 
 I do love you but it's 
 Alright 
 Fighting to keep us together, hope it's worth a try 
 You ain't always been a angel but heaven's on our side 
 I got my demons too, I know just how you feel 
 You can be real with me, that's why you're still with me 
 Can't hide behind the carats on a diamond ring 
 I don't even care if you lie to me 
 'Cause there ain't much to kiss but me these days 
 I say I do just to say I don't 
 Don't give me no reason to go through your phone 
 This is deeper than you and other women 
 This is daddy issues 
 This is years putting up with the real time niggas 
 So hold on, hold on, don't let me go 
 Hold on, hold on (hey) 
 So hold on, hold on, don't let me go 
 Hold on, hold on 
 You tell me you love me 
 But tell me again, yeah 
 I need the reassurance every now and then 
 Love ain't a game full of X's and O's 
 But I done been played before 
 I played it safe before 
 Gave it up to somebody 
 Who didn't deserve my body 
 You gon' have to lend a shoulder 
 Help me kill this hangover 
 I believe you love me 
 Like C's and D's 
 And you gon' take responsibilities 
 On my healing, I'm feeling 
 Don't go trading years that we put in 
 So hold on, hold on, don't let me go 
 Hold on, hold on (hey) 
 So hold on, hold on, don't let me go 
 Hold on, hold on 
 You think I'd leave you sad, baby 
 You know me better than that 
 You think I'm laying down 
 Way down on your knees, baby 
 I wouldn't do that, yeah
