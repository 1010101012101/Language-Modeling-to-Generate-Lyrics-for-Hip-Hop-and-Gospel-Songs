If I tell you, you belong to me 
 Would you be mine, in reality? 
 And not just in my mind 
 I'm so tired of being invisible, to you 
 I'm so tired 
 How could a boy like you, ever want a girl like me? 
 You're way outta my league 
 Way outta my league 
 'Cause boys like you, don't go for girls like me 
 You're way outta my league 
 Way... 
 I can't believe you stayed 
 Surprised that you even looked my way 
 Fuck it 
 I'm fine if, you want it 
 There's so many reasons to be on it 
 'Cause I'm realest 
 So you feel this 
 And I don't blame you no 
 How could a boy like you, ever want a girl like me? 
 You're way outta my league 
 Way outta my league 
 'Cause boys like you, don't go for girls like me 
 You're way outta my league 
 Way... 
 No I don't like making mistakes 
 'Cause my heart's so easy to break 
 That's a risk I don't usually take ooh, uh 
 Got this feeling I hate to lose 
 That's the feeling when I'm with you 
 Doing things I don't usually do, no 
 How could a boy like you, ever want a girl like me? 
 You're way outta my league 
 Way outta my league 
 'Cause boys like you, don't go for girls like me 
 You're way outta my league 
 Way...
