Give me your love love give me 
 You knock me down 
 My pride hits the ground 
 Don't know if this is going away 
 My hearts beat jumps 
 To the tip of my tongue 
 I think you're wanting to say come over here 
 Give me you're love love give me 
 Give me you're love love give me 
 Boy you don't know what you're doin' to me 
 Just give me your love love give me 
 Right here, don't care 
 It could just be love, or something like it 
 Boy I don't know, but I need your right now 
 It could just be love, or something like it 
 I think I like it 
 And I'll know soon enough
