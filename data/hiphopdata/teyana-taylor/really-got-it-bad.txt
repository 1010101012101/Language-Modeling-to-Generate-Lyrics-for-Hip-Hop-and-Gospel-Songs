Everytime I see you I can't think what to say. 
 Cause you got me blushin' when you pass my way 
 Everytime I see you I can't think what to say. 
 Cause you got me blushin' when you pass my way. 
 Everytime I see you I can't think what to say. 
 Cause you got me blushin' when you pass my way. 
 My friends say I'm frontin 'cause I don't want to speak to you. 
 But I know that's not true. 
 Cause i-really got it bad for you baby. 
 Boy you know I got it bad-cause all I do is think about you baby. 
 'Cause I think about you yeah-i know I might sound confused baby. 
 I'm feeling so confused yeah-and all I really want is you baby. 
 I just want you to know-when you're not here 
 When you're not here baby-all I do I think of you 
 All I do all I do is think of you. 
 When I'm alone all I do is think of you. 
 So another day passes by and I still haven't told you how I feel-cause them chicks be in your face. 
 All them other girls may sweat your style but that's not how I get down. 
 So I'll wait for you to come around. 
 Really got it bad for you baby. I really got it bad yeah. 
 Cause all I do is think about you baby. I think about you baby. I know I might sound confused baby. confused yeah. but all I really want is you baby. all I really want is you-when you're not here all I do is think of you. 
 When I'm alone all I do is think of you. 
 Reprise: 
 Time after time I try to tell myself why. can't I jus talk to you and get it over with. my pride is just so high and I get so shy around you. and I don't know what to do. 
 Really got it bad for you baby. cause all I do is think about you baby. I need to tell you tell you how I feel. I know I might sound confused baby. confused-but all I really want is you baby. I'm so into you-when you're not here all I do is think of you. when I'm alone all I do is think of you. of you of you...
