I don't know how else to keep it 
 So ima' keep it one hundred. 
 I didn't mean to get your hopes up 
 I was thinking that's what I wanted 
 Kick-flipped the script on ya. 
 I bet ya never seen this one coming. 
 I'm changing up like autumn, 
 Got you heated up like summer 
 I can't say I'm not impressed with you 
 (But I'm not ready to invest) 
 I can't say I'm not the girl for you 
 (I just might not be her yet) 
 Feels like all this pressures on me right now 
 (Like I don't have a choice) 
 Know this much--you can be sure that this 
 (Ain't about no other boys) 
 'Cause if it was anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone - lord knows it would be you. 
 (Lord knows it would be you) 
 Before I see anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone - boy ima' come see you. 
 (Something always brings me back to you) 
 It's not love but its something like that 
 It ain't love but its something like that 
 It's not love but its something like that 
 Boy its complicated... 
 Now I can tell your disappointed 
 Looking at me like we twisted 
 Tryna figure out where my head at 
 Everything I told you I meant it! 
 Whatchu thinking that I'm feel real free now? 
 But I'm feeling something different. 
 You act like you don't understand boy, why don't you just listen? 
 I can't say I'm not impressed with you 
 (But I'm not ready to invest) 
 I can't say I'm not the girl for you 
 (I just might not be her yet) 
 Feels like all this pressure is on me right now 
 (Like I don't have a choice) 
 Know this much--you can be sure that this 
 (Ain't about no other boys) 
 'Cause if it was anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone - lord knows it would be you. 
 (Lord knows it would be you) 
 Before I see anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone - boy ima' come see you. 
 (Something always brings me back to you)
