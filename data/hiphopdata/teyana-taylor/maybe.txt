Yo Gotti: 
 Maybe, maybe it's the money, baby, or maybe not 
 Maybe I fell in love with ya on the spot, never lie 
 I keep it G, I told you that there off the top 
 Maybe you never met a street nigga thuggin' on the block 
 An' I ain't fuckin' with no thot shawty 
 Powerball, this your shot shawty 
 And if they hatin' den let 'em talk, shawty 
 And I been drinking too much, and it got me thinking too much 
 You in my head what the fuck? 
 Teyana Taylor: 
 I say boy you done did it 
 Love how you kiss it 
 Ooh you can get it 
 I never felt like that before 
 Ooh, you the realest 
 Yeah, I admit it 
 All in my feelings, Damn 
 Teyana Taylor: 
 Had to pause, Nigga wait a minute 
 Almost tapped out when you started swimmin' 
 A little cocky, I can deal with that 
 'Cause you put it down and I need parts of that 
 Just text your phone nigga where you at? 
 Give me rounds, I need all of that 
 Ain't even gotta knock, left the door unlocked 
 So is you tryna take it down or nah? 
 Or nah? 
 Teyana Taylor: 
 Maybe it's the liquour, maybe it's the song 
 Don't know what it is, but you turn me on 
 Maybe it's the bar, maybe it's the club 
 Don't know what it is, maybe I'm in love 
 Teyana Taylor: 
 In the club twisted, ooh reminiscing 
 Boy, I can vision round two 
 It's me and you and I'm winning 
 There's no competition, boy, you about to 
 Had to pause, Nigga wait a minute

 Pusha T: 
 Who she seeing? Who she fucking on the low? 
 She kissing him, she kissing her, she one of those 
 Fuck is you? you TMZ? you Sandra Rose? 
 That's little sis, I'm big bro, so let's go 
 Maybe it's the way I speak it, know the spot and how to reach it 
 When I meet ya man, shake his hand, that's how I keep our little secret 
 Woo no pillow talk, no kiss 'n' tell, they countin' coins, my pockets deeper than a wishing well 
 She like balla's, she like birken buyers, she got a wild side, she like dope boys with a certain fire. 
 That's me nigga, so that's me nigga, no if and's no maybe's, so that's we nigga 
 Teyana Taylor: 
 Maybe it's the liquour, maybe it's the song
