I just don't understand 
 In a dream, my heart, somewhere in the dark 
 In the drop 
 Missed a couple parts then it stopped 
 But the beat changed 
 I can't think straight, yeah 
 Like a work of art lookin' at my heart 
 On the wall, tell me what it mean to ya, he say she say 
 I tried to explain the words are just words, no difference 
 The love in my heart is not the same, it's just different 
 And you break my heart 
 You gotta hit the start 
 You surprised, do it every time 
 Then you go for a joyride on your side 
 Actin' like I'm not lovin' every drop 
 Doin' for well over the top 
 Goin' wild, free way 
 If they see me 
 I tried to explain the words are just words, can't quit this 
 The love in my heart is not the same, it's different 
 Know you know you hurtin' baby 
 Just don't understand 
 I swear, I swear 
 Just don't understand 
 I don't wanna, I don't wanna 
 I don't wanna, I don't wanna
