See me in the club wit my bottles up 
 Tell the bartender he ain't got enough 
 See me in the club wit them bottles up 
 See me in the club wit the models, uh 
 Rock with me now 
 I'ma hit 'em hard, J to the mwah 
 Lil' weed on me, left the joints in the car 
 Cardigan, Hermes skully with the scarf 
 You could just look at 'em and tell that he a boss 
 Order what you sip on, Louis Vuitton slip on 
 If you can't stay in the race, you get skipped on 
 Over for the smooth shit, time for improvement, 
 Elegant wrist wear, Turion movement 
 Yeah there's twelve bottles to a table, 
 Gambling with your life playing Lotto with your label. 
 You always in the red but their object is to pay you 
 Then you wonder why I'm in the projects with the yayo 
 Strength's in the music, according to how you use it 
 But when you get addicted to something, you abuse it 
 Yeah we're gonna drink till the sunlight 
 Listen here, I don't do it unless it's done right 
 See me in the club wit my bottles up 
 Tell the bartender he ain't got enough 
 See me in the club wit the models, huh 
 Rock wit me now 
 Right now I'm in my prime (rock wit me now) 
 Always been ahead of my time (so rock wit me now) 
 I ain't here to tell you no lies (rock wit me now) 
 Top five dead or alive (rock wit me now) 
 Yeah I'm getting money ain't nothing new 
 Nah, you should see they face when I'm coming through 
 Bunch of weirdos lookin' corny 
 Started off wit blue jeans then I took it to Barney's 
 Keep you girl over there if you notice she horny 
 Shoulda left her in the crib if you notice she on me 
 Bars is Polish spring, flow is Dasani 
 Purple label that's why you ain't notice the Pony 
 You see the difference in the stones, 
 Forty cal. kick back different when it's chrome 
 Now I react a lil' different 'cause I'm grown, 
 The sour come out when the piff is all gone 
 Stay givin' 'em hell, keep heaven wit me 
 I seen the game winner rim out, that's a? 
 I'm in down seventh, in the new seven fifty 
 And all I do is pray that the Feds never get me
