I like BBC, hoodies, and stuff. 
 Bape make kickers yeah that's watsup. 
 Hogging dem jeans, same cut different pocket, 
 Everybody know it's all about that back pocket, 
 Diamonds on my neck, d-diamonds on my grillz, 
 Skittle colored, taste the rainbow, 
 Wrist don't chill,

 Sitting at the bus stop, suckin on a lollipop, in my ice cream top,

 I like skateboards, bikes and things, 
 Packed in the back of that old white thing, 
 Keys keys jingling, 
 No light scenes, 
 Boys screaming I'm so sweet 16, 
 Speaking of which, 
 Y'all know where the party, 
 Y'all know who fell through just like Barbie, 
 Who brought the 80's back like that old Atari 
 Y'all know Teyana get the party started, 
 So crazy so retarded, 
 I'm so New York, 
 I'm so damn Harlem,

 Pharell said I beg your pardon, 
 Hold up,

 She's nuts, 
 My swagga oh so mean, 
 Number one draft pick on that star track team.
