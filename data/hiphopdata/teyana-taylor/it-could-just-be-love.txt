Give me your love, love give me 
 You knock me down 
 My pride hits the ground 
 Don't know if this is going away 
 My heartbeat jumps to the tip of my tongue 
 I think I wanna say come over here 
 Give me your love, love give me 
 Give me your love, love give me 
 Boy you don't know what you're doin' to me 
 Just give me your love, love give me 
 Right here, don't care 
 It could just be love, or something like it 
 Boy I don't know 
 But I need you right now 
 It could just be love, or something like it 
 I acted like it 
 But I'll know soon enough 
 I let you in 
 Sweet blissful sin 
 Questioning if you're worth my religion 
 My heart skips only to the beat of your drum 
 I can feel your rhythm calling me, saying 
 Give me your love, love give me 
 Give me your love, love give me 
 Boy you don't know what you're doin' to me 
 Just give me your love, love give me 
 Right here, don't care 
 It could just be love, or something like it 
 Boy I don't know 
 But I need you right now 
 It could just be love, or something like it 
 I acted like it 
 But I'll know soon enough 
 Struck down 
 Sure that love is a gun 
 Shot down, I'm another victim 
 Cold blood 
 Leaving me here lonely (no) 
 First thought 
 Was I the only one thinking? 
 This was not from the beginning 
 Despite both of our good intentions 
 Love was a gun to me 
 It could just be love, or something like it 
 Boy I don't know 
 But I need you right now 
 It could just be love, or something like it 
 I acted like it 
 But I'll know soon enough
