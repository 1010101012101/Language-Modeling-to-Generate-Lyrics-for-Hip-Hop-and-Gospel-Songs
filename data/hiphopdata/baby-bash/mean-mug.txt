You embarrassing us 
 Take that monkey shit off 
 You embarrassing us 
 Now everybody gon' do it, y'all know what's up 
 Look on my face, and it's called the mean mug 
 Everybody gon' do it when they step up in the club 
 Mask on tight, and it's called the mean mug 
 Now everybody gon' do it, I practice looking hard 
 Mamis, hood rats, even super bad broads 
 Everybody gon' do it, man, y'all know what it is 
 Face in ya face and we do it like this 
 Mug on mad dawg like I'm ready to box 
 But I ain't trippin' past the women and some Henny on the rocks 
 I got a whole lot of credit and my pennies is long 
 I put a thizz on my face and bob my head to the song 
 Fall through the door with a smirk, haters feelings gettin' hurt 
 'Cause I pulled that main skirt, Mac Dre on my shirt 
 You know we fixin' to perk, face lookin' like I 
 Just smelled some grand daddy purp' 
 Purp', you see, I like where I'm at but I love where I'm goin' 
 I'm leaving with a half breed Mexican and Samoan 
 She super bad, stuntin' hard, mean mug on her grill 
 Countin' feri', already steady huggin' the wheel 
 Now everybody gon' do it, y'all know what's up, look 
 On my face, and it's called the mean mug 
 Everybody gon' do it when they step up in the club 
 Mask on tight, and it's called the mean mug 
 Now everybody gon' do it, I practice looking hard 
 Mamis, hood rats, even super bad broads 
 Everybody gon' do it, man, y'all know what it is 
 Face in ya face and we do it like this
