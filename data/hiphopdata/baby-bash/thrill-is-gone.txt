(Feat. Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic) 
 I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to 
 I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to 
 Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back 
 Tell me what would you do, you do, you do? 
 Things ain't like they use to be baby girl you're losing me 
 I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to 
 Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back 
 Tell me what would you do, you do, you do? 
 Well now the thrill is long gone 
 The feelin' is all wrong 
 Got me feelin' uncomfortable all in my own home 
 And your ring tone song deleted from my phone 
 And danm I use to love that song when it came on 
 And no this ain't about no new company 
 It's just time for you to do you and me to do me 
 And you know, and you know 
 That I know, that I know 
 That we don't belong together no more 
 And even though the memories still make me wanna believe 
 The facts I gotta face em 
 It's over it's history 
 Cause you know 
 We gotta breath and I don't wanna deceive 
 A lie or get it twisted so baby I gotta leave. 
 I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to 
 I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to 
 Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back 
 Tell me what would you do, you do, you do? 
 Things ain't like they use to be baby girl you're losing me 
 I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to 
 Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back 
 Tell me what would you do, you, do you do? 
 The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone, the thrill is gone 
 The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone, the thrill is gone 
 The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone 
 Well now I wish there was a way I could turn back the clock 
 When the loven was so hot 
 Good to the last drop 
 And I wish there was a way I could rewind the time 
 Wait before the tears and the years on the grind 
 Now you lookin' at me crazy every time you hear my phone ring 
 Use to get along better back when we was homies 
 Use to keep it low key now we fight in public 
 Argue about anything and every single subject 
 So now I think it's better if we just keep it movin 
 I won't trip off you and you won't trip off what I'm doin' 
 Cause baby this ain't crackin' like it use to be 
 I think you just got a little use to me 
 I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to 
 I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to 
 Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back 
 Tell me what would you do, you do, you do? 
 Things ain't like they use to be baby girl you're losing me 
 I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to 
 Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back 
 Tell me what would you do, you do, you do? 
 The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone, the thrill is gone 
 The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone, the thrill is gone 
 The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone 
 Well now I wish there was a way I could turn back the clock 
 When the loven was so hot 
 Good to the last drop 
 And I wish there was a way I could rewind the time 
 Wait before the tears and the years on the grind 
 I don't wanna say it but you know what I'm thinking 
 And we should be apart 
 Now it's over like a holiday 
 I don't wanna say it but you know what I'm thinking 
 And we should be apart 
 Now it's over 
 I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to 
 I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to 
 Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back 
 Tell me what would you do, you do, you do? 
 Things ain't like they use to be baby girl you're losing me 
 I wish it could be like it use to, use to, use to 
 Baby after all of that I don't think I'm coming back 
 Tell me what would you do, you do, you do? 
 The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone, the thrill is gone 
 The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone, the thrill is gone 
 The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone, the thrill is gone, 
 The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone, the thrill is gone, 
 The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone, the thrill is gone, 
 The thrill is gone
