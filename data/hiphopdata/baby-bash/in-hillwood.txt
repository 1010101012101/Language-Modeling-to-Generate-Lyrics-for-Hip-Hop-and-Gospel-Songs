You see I smash on you pussies and creep with the thugs 
 I got a T-shirt that say "Weed is not drugs" 
 I got a tight spot that sits by the sea 
 Three story beach house, let's throw a party 
 F!?#ed up in the head, I don't know what happened 
 I have nightmares and I wake up laughing 
 With a bottle of Tequila, tryna reach the bottom 
 And why do all my aspirins have an 'X' on 'em? 
 Got two rusty Gats, and two housecats 
 And I don't feed'em S?!* so they live off the rats 
 And still didn't even pay my warrants 
 I just sat up in jail and ate my porridge 
 In Hillwood, where they ain't afraid to shoot 
 In Hillwood, where the fiends play the flute 
 In Hillwood, where they can't see the light 
 In Hillwood, where they don't sleep at night 
 (Bash) 
 Hit the-hit the dope house 'cause I had to recop it 
 I need some Purity so I screwed it and chopped it 
 Haters can't block it, f!*?# a ___ ___ 
 Mexican's getting big so they start getting jealous 
 Overzealous when we dip through the spot 'n' to the club 
 ___Blockers getting slapped with a muthaf__in snub 
 You a thug, you a killa, you a gangsta, you a G 
 But I bet you with these hands man, you can't f!*?# with me 
 You just a silly trick mark mayne, talkin' all that maza 
 You love the smell of sh?!*, yeah you love the smell of caca 
 While we love the smell of roses and we drivin' something vicious 
 Yeah we comin' down droppin' all you punk be!*?#es 
 (Ice) 
 Dicen que nos quieren matar pero ni se puedden acercar 
 Esta rola es una bomba que acaba de estallar 
 So fijate bien why mira quien es, no somos dos somos los tres 
 Los que fumamos mota para relisar estres 
 El mojado why el sur del park con el Bash listo para tumbarte 
 Listos para un desaster why por eso no quieren acercarse 
 So pescamos todos armados why el carro con rimes cromados 
 Escucha todo lo que yo te escribo por eso mi estilo es bien frio 
 Representando los illegales why todos que crusaron el rio 
 Gritando sigan me los malos rodiando de mil caiga palos 
 Brincado en cada vecendario gritando libreren a Carlos 
 (Spm) 
 I solemly swear to tell the truth and nothing but 
 My niggas dead all because a f!*?#in slut 
 I never love a hoe, that one fa sho 
 F!*?# home 'cause I roam jus like a buffalo 
 I'm the baby of the family, runt of the litter 
 I can't stop smoking cause no one like a quitter 
 Every three months my house would get raided 
 This muthaF__in album is the f!*?#in sh!*?, ain't it? 
 Hydroponic leaves, rollin' up my sleeves 
 Throw your guns up in the sky for me 
 Hollin peace to my boys on the Hillwood strand 
 Tryna make some cash, momma please understand
