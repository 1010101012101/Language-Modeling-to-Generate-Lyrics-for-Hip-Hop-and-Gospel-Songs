Yeah, that's my shorty doowop 
 Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do) 
 Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do) 
 And I can't wait to be alone with you 
 I bet you ain't never seen a shorty so fly 
 Pushin catty plaint with the chrome choppin' by 
 Throwin' up player wave to my partners on the block 
 They all show love to my shorty doo-wop 
 In them juicy fruit jeans bumpin 315s 
 Livin' every fantasy and ghetto girl dreams 
 Watchin swinging bang and she bend another corner 
 Lookin' way cool comin' through with the doshure 
 Now after two honey blunts I discovered the buzz 
 I'm call her shorty she gonna call me love 
 And through the thick of it all 
 She excepted collect calls 
 When the daddy got caught up by the law 
 Yeah, that's my shorty doowop 
 Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do) 
 Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do) 
 And I can't wait to be alone with you 
 For real though, for real though, for real though 
 She the girl in the movie and I'm the hero 
 Stuck with me with the violated pero 
 And came up when she started with zero 
 Baby Bash Latino Robert DeNiro 
 She got with me 'cause her hubby was a weirdo 
 And yes sir she lookin' so mighty mighty 
 Love me 'cause I'm fresh and clean and so tighty 
 Tha missing piece to the puzzle, the grind, the hustle 
 Respect when I'm good and love me when I'm in trouble 
 And yes sir, oh no, and yes sir she lookin' so throw 
 Yeah, that's my shorty doowop 
 Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do) 
 Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do) 
 And I can't wait to be alone with you 
 I can't wait to be alone with you 
 'Cause you the only boo who do the freaky things you do 
 You keep me fellin high you keep my drama low 
 Yeah I'm your shorty boy but you already know 
 Yeah, that's my shorty doowop 
 Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do) 
 Yeah, that's my shorty doowop (I love the thangs she do) 
 And I can't wait to be alone with you
