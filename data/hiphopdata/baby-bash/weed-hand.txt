Sometimes da game got me stressin partner I can't lie 
 I roll me a sweet smash off 'n' da ride a whole piece I ain't never lied 
 I put my weed hand 'n' da sky 
 I put my weed hand 'n' da sky 
 I respect it for da luv of life 
 A whole piece I ain't never lied 
 I put my weed hand in da sky 
 I put my weed hand in da sky 
 V1: 
 The smokes killing off my lungs and appendix 
 It's baby bash the modern day jimmy hendrix 
 Deep down in Texas, 
 Dope house is so relentless 
 The fluff is endless 
 Smokin' wit my lawer and my dentist 
 Feelin' stupendiss wanna come to my quarter stacks 
 Smokin' on greener reef 
 Singing boby to dem older cats 
 (Bobby brown) Dem dolger sax 
 Wit a coffee grinder at my mercy 
 Dun rolled a lax wit a highspeed chasers ones dat coudn't church me 
 Cocked mouthed and thirsty gotta keep my spirit lifted though 
 My spiritual, lyrical, it's hydromyrical 
 I'm comin' visious though, 
 Wit a fully loaded off dat durby 
 Feelin' so worthy 'cause my vacume lungs are like dat curby 
 And don't desturb me when I'm floatin to my foreign land 
 You no fo' sho' I keep my pipe in my weed hand 
 My weed hand is something I don't disrestpect 
 Your weed hand throw it up and represent your weed 
 V2: 
 I'ma gonna admit it and you know I'm wid it 
 Begin his life, got his only one and split it 
 Lit it up wit my nephew 
 And now I'm floatin 
 My crown is broaken 
 Soakin up my soal 
 Sippen styraphone cups 
 Choken now I'm low 
 If you ridden on us dats cool but pass da joint 
 Diamonds flyin and you just had to go 
 'Cause you dun cast da vote 
 And I didn't even get a hit 
 No not even a little bit 
 So now help me get rid of dis 
 Baby girl don't disrespecr the luv 
 And I can't see dat 
 Ask where we get the best of bud 
 Put up ur weed hand 
 V3: 
 Man I been down dis way b4 
 I hit da bong back up and blow 
 I'm too damn high don't pass me no mo' 
 I blaze drown, sip on a 4 
 Stayin high I'm on a note 
 U can smell da bong all on my clothes 
 Man look at my eyes they bout to b closed 
 I'm choken dudes up out hte room wit my weed hand in the sky 
 I'm stayin blowed on octamodes and I'm leanin half da time 
 I'm stayin high and I hustle fool 
 Don't be at home up on my ass gotta get up and glock sum cash 
 Hoes thinkin' they gonna smoke for free 
 But not wit a young P.I.M.P 
 Just 'cause I'm young don't mean I'm dumb 
 Red microphones now blaze sum of dat greener reef 
 And pour sum of dat purple stuff 
 Down here we smokin' bud 
 Ya I no you herd of us 
 Ending outro: 
 My weed hand, 
 Put ur weed hand in da sky, 
 My weed hand, 
 East west, 
 My weed hand, 
 North south, 
 Something we can all relate to, 
 My weed hand.
