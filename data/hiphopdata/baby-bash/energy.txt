 Energy, digging on your energy 
 Energy, digging on your energy 
 Energy, digging on your energy. energy 
 Boy, I'm digging on your energy (Energy) 
 And I'm digging what you telling me (Telling me) 
 So I wrote this little melody (Melody) 
 And dedicate it to my favorite lover 
 (Verse 1 - Natalie) 
 I'm lying in bed 
 There's thoughts in my head 
 I'm thinking 'bout you 
 Over and over and over and over again 
 What can I tell you, you got me so twisted 
 Tossing and turning 
 Over and over and over and over again 
 So I wrote a song tonight (Tonight) 
 You weren't begging me to write (To write) 
 Tell me is it cool tonight (Tonight) 
 To don't know what's on my mind 
 Boy, I'm digging on your energy (Energy) 
 And I'm digging what you telling me (Telling me) 
 So I wrote this little melody (Melody) 
 And dedicate it to my favorite lover 
 (Verse 2 - Baby Bash) 
 Rain and shine sleet and snow 
 Couldn't stop the way we flow 
 Welcome to my miracle 
 And I'm digging on your lyrical 
 Your melody is my remedy 
 Squeeze to my Hennessey 
 The one to call when I'm sipping for 
 With the candy coated Tennessee 
 Just make a wish. 
 And let's make it a fish with your boy Baby Bash with some heavenly bliss 
 Because your kisses on my lips, girl I'm ready to roll 
 With so vicious and bubblicious, the energy's throwed 
 Boy, I'm digging on your energy (Energy) 
 And I'm digging what you telling me (Telling me) 
 So I wrote this little melody (Melody) 
 And dedicate it to my favorite lover 
 (Verse 3 - Natalie) 
 Boy, you know that I dig you 
 I fell in love when I met you 
 I love the way you make me feel 
 Your energy is something real (Fa. sho.) 
 Boy, I love the way (I love the way) 
 You make me feel (You make feel) 
 Is something 'bout you loving me 
 Can't do without your energy 
 Boy, I'm digging on your energy (Energy) 
 And I'm digging what you telling me (Telling me) 
 So I wrote this little melody (Melody) 
 And dedicate it to my favorite lover 
 (Baby Bash) 
 Energy, digging on your energy 
 Energy, digging on your energy 
 Energy, digging on your energy. energy
