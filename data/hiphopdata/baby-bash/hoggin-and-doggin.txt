Chorus - Carolyn: 
 We we we mobbin 
 We hoggin and we doggin 
 We creepin' and we crawlin 
 It's time to do you all in 
 Fa sho 
 (Lucky) 
 Hold up I'm too throwed, I'm the young capo 
 5 star general, Lucky Luciano 
 Yo my check's too fat, the banks can't cash it 
 Gimmie ten days, meanwhile I got plastic 
 Country to country I live in hotels 
 No ashy elbows, pedicured toenails 
 Sittin' on a beach chair, 200 dollar chanclas 
 Am I in Acapulco or Puerto Vallaca? 
 Sippin outta pineapple, actin' a fool 
 Step out my balcony and check out my view 
 I'm lookin' brand new, I get menages crunk 
 Lucky look cleaner then Andre Monk 
 Open up my closet and you in the Galleria 
 I'm the shit homeboy call me Lucky Diarrhea 
 Covered in diamonds, get a load of this wrist 
 Just to show out and stunt, I'm the Dope House Prince 
 (Spm) 
 I'm kinda hotta than lava, I got a dog that slobba 
 I might be yo father betta ask yo mama 
 I practice Karate like the boy Chuck Norris 
 I'm Papa Bear I'm like "Who the hell dem eatin my porridge?" 
 I'm still Ralph Lauren and I'm still Mike Jordan 
 I'm still commin down Orem just floorin the foreign 
 Never borin or simple, man I'm really excitin 
 I got to clubs and be fightin, I be kickin and bitin 
 I might poke ya eye out, I don't fight that fair 
 I fought a dudde with some braids, and started pullin his hair 
 But my boys back me up and leave nobody standin 
 I'm like "Why y'all jump in man I almost had'em" 
 And they was like "Los he was beatin' yo ass" 
 I was letting him get tierd, man you messed up my plans 
 Anyway, I'mma write a song about it and tell 
 All my fans that I beat him up all by myself--haha 
 (Low-G) 
 I might play Chalupa, that's Mexican Bingo 
 Peace to my boys up in Coffield and Beto 
 My Benz take diesel, dejame explico 
 If I hit the pen walk around with a pico 
 I used to slang cincos, chilled on Domingos 
 Dickies look young ain't got no wrinkles 
 Shoot like Ming when he hit 12 footaz 
 I be pulling hoes like a kid pick boogaz 
 You can see my Rolly when I dip guacamole 
 Got all white pit like Angelina Jolie 
 I put red dots on 9 milla glocks 
 Might make you think that you got chicken pox 
 Got rims like a spida, weed to the lighta 
 It's ya boy Low, I'mma killa not a fighta 
 Roll with my china, phone off ringa 
 I know you hear the hook, nigga that's my lil prima 
 I'm at Dope House smoked out, Baby Bash loc'd out 
 Doin' tracks with Charlie Brown when he broke out 
 He chocked out his C.O., did it on the D-lo 
 Went to see his wife and his daughter and his hijo 
 The game is so frio, now he tippin Styrofoam 
 Said he gotta be right back before the lights is on 
 But it's all gravity, learn from tragedy 
 Just to let you know how cold them batches be 
 'Cause when it comes to the jealous man it get messy 
 I fuck around and gotta turn into some Joe Peci 
 I pimp the blood ouy ya mama and ya loved ones 
 Sell dog shit to ya uncles and ya cousins 
 And guaranteed that you won't say nada 
 Radio or not, man you still don't want no brrr--aaa, brrr--aa 
 And that's the really really realest shit I ever spoken 
 Don't get it twisted mayne, Dope House is still open 
 Creepin' and we crawlin, time to do you all in...
