All you need to know is you've got a friend 
 We've been living life, right till the end 
 If I'm troubled I know I can depend 
 'Cause all I need to know is I've got a friend 
 Baby let's cruise with the radio tunes 
 You know the best times come when there's nothing to do 
 It's rare that a player get a minute or two 
 So I cherish every second with a girl like you 
 Ain't nothing like a home girl down for the ride 
 Nothing like a home girl down for life 
 Baby be my love, you could be my Left-Eye 
 Be my umbrella, through the rain or shine 
 When I'm out of state I know you'll rep me 
 Ain't no other woman will accept me 
 A man's only true as his options 
 But I keep it real home girl, 'cause I've got you 
 When you feel a hand on your back, you've got a friend 
 When you put me on the right track, you've got a friend 
 When I show the love right back, you've got a friend 
 Damn it feels good to know I've got a friend 
 All you need to know is you've got a friend, 
 We've been living life right till the end 
 If I'm troubled I know I can depend 
 'Cause all I need to know is I've got a friend 
 Yeah, when things get a little shaky like a can of Krylon 
 You need a shoulder to cry on, need someone to rely on 
 I want you to know when you need a friend 
 I'm definitely a friend you can depend on 
 You can depend on me 
 Like my name was Smokey 
 So when things don't seem to be going your way 
 And nothing seems to be going right 
 I want to be the man that'll brighten your day 
 And turn your darkness to light 
 I'll be around to turn your frown upside down, permanently 
 Because you've been a good woman to me 
 You deserve the best and nothing less 
 So the best is what you get and all my respect 
 What you expect 
 You've got my palabra 
 All the way till the end 
 Baby doll you've got yourself a friend 
 All you need to know is you've got a friend 
 We've been living life right till the end 
 If I'm troubled I know I can depend 
 'Cause all I need to know is I've got a friend 
 I'll always be your player partner 
 In and out the hot tub, always steak and lobster, 
 Smoking on a chopper 
 Scraping through the boulevard, back to the avenue 
 Good vibe, attitude, I ain't even mad at you 
 Matter of fact that's all I feel with some gratitude 
 I just appreciate the time that I have with you 
 Now I'm in and out your life like a robbery 
 Got me on the road till I'm getting paid properly 
 And I can feel that you still so proud of me 
 And I can never get your corazon out of me 
 So little mama I'm a always be your handyman 
 So give me a call when you ready for some candyland 
 All you need to know is you've got a friend 
 We've been living life right till the end 
 If I'm troubled I know I can depend 
 'Cause all I need to know is I've got a friend 
 All you need to know is you've got a friend 
 We've been living life right till the end 
 If I'm troubled I know I can depend 
 'Cause all I need to know is I've got a friend
