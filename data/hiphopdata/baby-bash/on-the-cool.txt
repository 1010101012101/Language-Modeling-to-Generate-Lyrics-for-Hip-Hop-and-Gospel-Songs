On Tha Cool 
 By Baby Bash 
 Album: 
 (Chorus: DJ Kane) 
 Let's keep it on the cool (keep it on the cool) 
 It's between, me and you all right 
 It's the freaky things we do 
 Cause baby I like it, I like it 
 Let's keep it on the cool (keep it on the cool) 
 If they all laugh at you 
 The little thangs you do 
 Cause baby I like it, I like it 
 (Baby Beesh) 
 It wasn't no love at first sight, it was sex on the first night 
 How could it be so wrong when it felt so strong, it felt so right 
 I like the way you back it up, cause yo chulo ain't no punk 
 Get it crunk, get it crunk from the back to the front, any way you want 
 Smoking, laughing, telling jokes, smashing riding on blades and spokes 
 Tell them we just friends, but you and I know, what's really though 
 You take me on your odyssey, keep the drama off of me 
 You love to get on top of me, when I get you wet and watery 
 We sizzo and uh, we doin' our thug thizzo', but yo friends don't know 
 We'll keep it low, and talk at the club a little and then 
 When you drop 'em off at home, get Beeshy on the celly 
 And I'll be at the telly, honey be all ready 
 (Baby Beesh) 
 Well now they think they know the deal, but they don't have a clue 
 The things we do me and you, got to keep it tight on the cool 
 Down low on a hush, take our time don't need to rush 
 You in my mind like cannabus, with the freaky way you make me bust 
 Freaky deaky every time you see me, you best believe me, I'ma lick 
 You down with berries and cream, you lick me with that wine and kiwi 
 You know it's nathin', to keep that gossip off of baking 
 That's why we shaking, them hatas spreading information 
 If only I knew then what I know now, things coulda been a little different 
 But as it stands, I got a girl at home already on suspicion 
 But I want my cake and eat it too, wanna be with her I wanna be with you 
 You telling me that you need it too, let me tell you what we fixed to do 
 (DJ Kane) 
 Ooh wee, I love it when you freak it like that 
 Ooh wee, on the cool coming through from the back 
 Ooh wee, I love to watch you dance on my lap 
 Ooh wee, uh ooh wee 
 Ooh wee, uh ooh wee 
 (Drew) 
 Ooh wee, you love to see your daddy roll up 
 Ooh wee, going hard in the paint Hold up 
 Ooh wee, them people in yo business so what (so what) 
 Ooh wee, ooh wee Ooh wee 
 (Baby Bash and DJ Kane) 
 Uh one time, so quick, how quick so quick 
 (Baby I like it oh I like it oh yeah oh yeah) 
 Uh, sho ffffosho ffffosho 
 Fo'sho!
