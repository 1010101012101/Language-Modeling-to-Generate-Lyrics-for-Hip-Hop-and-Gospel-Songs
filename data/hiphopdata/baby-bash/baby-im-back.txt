(Chorus Akon) 
 Don't look no farther! 
 Baby I'm back (yeah) 
 I'm here to cater to you (any thing that you want me to do: ill do it) 
 'Cause I'll be your lover (I'll be your lover) 
 I'll be your best friend 
 Tell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and ill do it) 
 (Baby Bash) 
 Now I'm back in a flesh 
 Feelin' so blessed, back in your corner suga, suga don't stress 
 Forget about the rest; let's go inside, I'm back in your zone 
 Baby I'm back in your vibe, now I can't be denied I can't lie I'm on ya 
 I never ever wanna say sayonara 
 Some body told me that the grass was greener 
 On the other side of lake ariba 
 Never really used to be a mean to cheat her 
 What I gotta do to be a keeper 
 These words comin' out the speaker, true love is off the meter 
 (Baby Bash) 
 I was gone for a minute but now I'm home, 
 Please forget me for being a rolling stone, 
 Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome, 
 Get off the phone tell them squares to leave you alone, 
 Let me spark your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet, 
 Cause you already know how I get it wet, how I keep it so saucy and I get respect, 
 You don't have to look no fartha, you dealin' with the whole enchilada 
 You don't have to look no fartha, you hotter then a fire starter 
 (Baby Bash) 
 I was gone for a minute, (ooh) [repeat x4] 
 Now I'm back let me hit it (ooh) [repeat x4]
