(Feat. Paula DeAnda) 
 (Chorus: Paula DeAnda) 
 As days go by 
 I'm missing you baby 
 Patiently waiting 
 For you 
 To hold you 
 To thrill you 
 To feel you 
 Tender kisses 
 Give you the love you've been missing 
 Boy I can't wait till you come back home 
 To have you all alone (As days go by) 
 I'm missing you baby 
 Patiently waiting 
 For you 
 To hold you 
 To thrill you 
 To feel you 
 Tender kisses 
 Give you the love you've been missing 
 Boy I can't wait till you come back home 
 To have you all alone 
 (As days go by) 
 (Baby Bash:) 
 Now I done came a long way 
 But ain't gone too far 
 And hope this love letter don't 
 Leave a big scar 
 So baby just hold on 
 Lil' momma just be strong 
 Cause no one knew the war 
 Would last us so long 
 The rockets the red glare 
 The bombs up in the air 
 I'm just doing my duty 
 But missin' it right there 
 So as days go by 
 I'm counting every minute 
 Wishing I was home 
 For sure with you in it 
 But the soldiers that 
 I'm runnin' with 
 Are ready to blitz 
 This ain't no video 
 This is just as real as it gets 
 I made some lifelong friends 
 Holdin' down the front line 
 And girl I can't wait 
 To get back in your sunshine 
 (Paula DeAnda:) 
 (As days go by) 
 I'm missing you baby 
 Patiently waiting 
 For you 
 To hold you 
 To thrill you 
 To feel you 
 Tender kisses 
 Give you the love you've been missing 
 Boy I can't wait till you come back home 
 To have you all alone (As Days go by) 
 I'm missing you baby 
 Patiently waiting 
 For you 
 To hold you 
 To thrill you 
 To feel you 
 Tender kisses 
 Give you the love you've been missing 
 Boy I can't wait till you come back home 
 To have you all alone 
 (As days go by) 
 (Baby Bash:) 
 Now as days go by 
 My time is spent reflecting 
 On all the lil' things 
 You said I was neglecting 
 They say you never know 
 What you have until it's gone 
 Didn't know back then 
 But I will from now on 
 When I try to channel out 
 All the fear and the stress 
 I picture me and you rollin' 
 Looking dressed to impress 
 And to know you'll be there 
 When I'm back from Iraq 
 And feel good to know 
 A real chica I have on my back 
 Give everybody huggs 
 And tell em' I really miss 'em ' 
 And your boy be back 
 When I'm through with my mission 
 Give everybody huggs 
 And tell em' I really miss em' 
 And your boy be back 
 When I'm through with my mission 
 (Paula DeAnda:) 
 (As days go by) 
 I'm missing you baby 
 Patiently waiting 
 For you 
 To hold you 
 To thrill you 
 To feel you 
 Tender kisses 
 Give you the love you've been missing 
 Boy I can't wait till you come back home 
 To have you all alone (As days go by) 
 I'm missing you baby 
 Patiently waiting 
 For you 
 To hold you 
 To thrill you 
 To feel you 
 Tender kisses 
 Give you the love you've been missing 
 Boy I can't wait till you come back home 
 To have you all alone 
 As days go by 
 As days go by 
 (Baby Bash:) 
 One day we gon' get it together one day we gon' get it together 
 One day we gon' get it together one day we gon' get it together 
 (As days go by) 
 One day we gon' get it together one day we gon' get it together 
 One day we gon' get it together one day we gon' get it together 
 As days go by
