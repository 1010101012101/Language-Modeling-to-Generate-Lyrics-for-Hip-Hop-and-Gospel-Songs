 Uh oh 
 She's so yummy yummy yummy 
 Oh she's sweet as honey 
 Oh I gotta get some na na, na na 
 She's so yummy and delicious 
 Oh with tender kisses 
 Oh I gotta get some na na, na na 
 Some na na (na na na) (x4) 
 Out with the old girl 
 In with the new 
 Tastes so good, lemme get me a spoon 
 31 flavors, I'm pimpin' withchu 
 And girl I got the munchies, so I'm stickin' withchu 
 Cinnamin spice up in my life, maybe one day you can be my wife (x2) 
 I can't wait, I got a date manana 
 And my girl got a platinum na na 
 She smell like shaqel with her cucumber melon 
 And her fashion is dipped in prada prada 
 I got a boss one on my team 
 Every playboy mansions dream 
 And she thicker than the sticker on my winter go-getter 'cause she break me off that candy cream 
 She's so yummy yummy yummy 
 Oh she's sweet as honey 
 Oh I gotta get some na na, na na 
 She's so yummy and delicious 
 Oh with tender kisses 
 Oh I gotta get some na na, na na 
 Some na na (na na na) (x4) 
 She got a stack full of cakes 
 And a million dollar waist 
 When she slid up on my chrome 
 She said it창s true ronny ray 
 You as cool as a shade 
 I said ya what창s goin' on 
 That창s when the na na got weird 
 And we started the perc 
 Getting high as a fire escape 
 She said I heard from a bird 'bout the way you get down 
 And now I'm ready with a video tape 
 I guess it was my destiny 
 To hit that juicy recipe 
 Call a man who did ectasy 
 With a whole lotta freaky energy 
 Swet azuca on my mind 
 With a top notch breezie on my line 
 I get a cavity girl every time 
 I go down low where the sun don창t shine 
 She's so yummy yummy yummy 
 Oh she's sweet as honey 
 Oh I gotta get some na na, na na 
 She's so yummy and delicious 
 Oh with tender kisses 
 Oh I gotta get some na na, na na 
 Some na na (na na na) (x4) 
 (instrumental) 
 She's so yummy yummy yummy 
 Oh she's sweet as honey 
 Oh I gotta get some na na, na na 
 She's so yummy and delicious 
 Oh with tender kisses 
 Oh I gotta get some na na, na na 
 Some na na (na na na) (x4)
