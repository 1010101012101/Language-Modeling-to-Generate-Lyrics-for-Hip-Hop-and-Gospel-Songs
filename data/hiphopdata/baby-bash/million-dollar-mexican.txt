Ah who got it

 Young bash 
 Jim johnson 
 Uh oh 
 She's so yummy yummy yummy 
 Oh she's sweet as honey 
 Ooh I gotta get some na na, na na 
 She's so yummy and delicious 
 Ooh her tender kisses 
 Ooh I gotta get some na na, na na 
 So right now (4x) 
 Out with the old girl 
 In with the new 
 Tastes so good 
 Lemme get me a scoop 
 31 flavours ain't pampn witchu 
 And girl I got the munchies 
 So I'm stickin witchu 
 Cinnamon spice up in my life 
 Maybe one day you can be my wife (2x) 
 I can't wait I gotta date ma na na 
 And my girl got a platinum na na 
 She smell like chanel with a cucumber melon 
 And her fashion is dipped in prada prada 
 I got a boss one on my team 
 Every playboy mansions dream 
 And she thicker than the sticker 
 On my winter go geta 
 'Cause she break me off that candy cream 
 She got a stock full of cakes 
 And a million dollar waste 
 When she slid up on my chrome 
 She said its true runny ray 
 You as cool as a shade 
 I sed y'all wats going on 
 That's when the na na got wet 
 And we started the purp 
 Gettn high as a fire escape 
 She sed I heard from a bird 
 'Bout the way you get down 
 And now I'm ready with a video tape 
 I get it was my destiny 
 To hit that juicy recipe 
 Carmel coated ecstasy 
 With a whole lotta freaky energy 
 Sweet arzuca on my mind 
 With a top notch breezie on my line 
 Got a cavity girl all the time 
 I go down low where the sun don't shine
