 Getting low, girl, uh, a trow girl 
 With game that'll make my toes curl 
 'Cause she's a beast in the bed and I'mma beast with her 
 Beat it up like a champ and, uh, she re-twitter 
 Bash be going hard, it's the headline news 
 She rocking the fresh Js, stilettos, the Jimmy Chu's 
 Black white and yellow bone, watchin' what they jelly on 
 Bringing major fedy home, ooh, what's poppin'? 
 We hit 'em with the honey tone, bringing daddy money home 
 Got me ridin' candy chrome, what that do? 
 Shoppin' for a new pair, stuntin' on you boppers 
 In the DJ booth giggin' with some punk rockers

 Send her down to Meh-hicom, she brining me the border back

 Grindin' it, grippin' it, poppin', lockin', droppin' and dippin' it 
 Pickin' it up and lickin' it, never missin' a beat or skippin' 
 She know that the fixtures diggin' it, look at her go, she kill it 
 Bad ass boots, big ass caboose 
 I'm tryin' to get her drunk, take her to the telian goose 
 Spark a fat ass blunt, put a talend in her 
 Unplug the smoke detector, get my head off and then eject her 
 I'mma macaroni man, I don't think you understand 
 I don't pay for pussy when pussy pay me, man 
 Steady stackin' hustler man, all about my rubber band 
 Real nigga haven't changed about money 
 Gotta keep my paper right, the brain-washer up all night 
 Picture this flow, she getting my dough, she bought a brand new bike 
 Letting 'em know, used to be proud, I don't care she dike 
 Baby can go, put on a show, she do what I like 
 Excuse me, miss, what's your name?
