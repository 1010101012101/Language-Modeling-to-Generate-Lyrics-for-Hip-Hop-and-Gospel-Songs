This is ain't nothing new to me 
 Look at what they do to me 
 Need to Chill, try to stop 
 Did dirt with it, now I gotta buy tha chop 
 (Firstverse) 
 I'm with my momma rant-a-car with ten and a half pounds 
 No DL's, an endless amount of rounds 
 With my mind on my mansion, I'm smashin about the town 
 You thought I was a hog? Wait till I clown now 
 Basha with me, believe me, disturbin three for the fifty 
 And I wish a mutha fucker would try to get with me 
 'Cause I'm nifty with the milly when the torch is on 
 And Play every play like its fourth and long 
 Now when the horse is gone, I beat the shit out the pig 
 It don't take much, to split a fools wig 
 See I'm only one shot from making the headlines 
 So quick nigga, got quarters and dead lines 
 Shakin the bed time, they checking my barcode 
 A.T.F, I.N.S and the US Marshal 
 And this is ain't nathin new to me 
 Capitalize on opportunity (Uh!) 
 And this is ain't nathin new to me 
 Capitalize on opportunity 
 (Which way did he go?) 
 (Which way did he go?) 
 (Which way did he go?) 
 This is ain't nothing new to me 
 Look at what they do to me 
 Need to Chill, try to stop 
 Did dirt with it now I gotta buy tha chop 
 This is ain't nothing new to me 
 Look at what they do to me 
 Need to Chill, try to stop 
 Did dirt with it now I gotta buy tha chop 
 (Second verse) 
 This old shit ain't new to me 
 I'm rockin' stolen jewelry 
 Try to chill so I leave the bay 
 Did dirt with it now I gotta keep the K 
 Bash a dude's wig over baby bash 
 He my smokin' nephew, we be checkin' brazin cash 
 We kept G's on the omni floor 
 Put the bloody bills with the Tommy in the drawer 
 Tell mummy with the rock, break a lil a corner off 
 I don't like that bammer, I don't wanna cough 
 You got to watch every step 
 P walk and pull out a teck 
 I thought you knew I'm a vet 
 Let loose and threw up my set 
 A-W-A-X to Latex 
 Glove on my left hand can only mean death mayne. 
 This is ain't nothing new to me 
 Look at what they do to me 
 Need to Chill, try to stop 
 Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop 
 This is ain't nothing new to me 
 Look at what they do to me 
 Need to Chill, try to stop 
 Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop 
 (Third verse) 
 Now it's that pimpin' ass Gringo 
 Bitch is you single? 
 I spit heat, hit the street, stack 'em out the window 
 Bay area lingo, iz what a playa blessed with 
 Ten shots with his own spots is all I ever messed with 
 So if you broke, I ain't even hearda ya 
 Come around me again and ima murder ya 
 I need some loot, so watch how I take ya town 
 A bitch wanna hold me, I track her down 
 Get up in the brain, take over the soul 
 4 G's a night, I'm ready to roll 
 A big long black hella beat in the trunk 
 Baby kick back its hella heat for the funk 
 A dare a mutha fucker, a step to the low 
 One too many drinks, now he's gettin' a roll 
 So??? Tell them get this 
 It's JT, I'm a dog when I spit this 
 This is ain't nothing new to me 
 Look at what they do to me 
 Need to Chill, try to stop 
 Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop 
 This is ain't nothing new to me 
 Look at what they do to me 
 Need to Chill, try to stop 
 Did dirt with it now I gotta buy the chop
