 Spreewells spinnin, my spreewells spinnin 
 His spreewells keep spinnin and my trunks on pop 
 My spreewells spinnin, my spreewells spinnin 
 His spreewells keep spinnin and my trunks on pop 
 Spreewells spinnin... my spreewells spinnin, spinnin, spinnin 
 You know da ese keep right now I ain't playin' with dem 
 Bently coupe drop down while you see da spreewells spin 
 Now see we choppin it up got the henny in da cup 
 Clean white tee tucked and I ain't givin' it a fuck 
 King diamonds for the wify, 15 karats for da soulja truck 
 Blow to da bone 2.2 pearly gold and I'm still sewing it down 
 Moon roof to da back bently coupe blowin' it out rock juice 
 Like a electric guitar, bounce to da sky like I'm tryna shoot 
 The stars and when I say what I do and I say what I've done 
 You don't wanna see me back cause, listen and my 
 Spreewells spinnin, my spreewells spinnin, my spreewells

 Now that's me coming with dem playa made mexicans that's baby 
 Bash on dat ass thankin' presidents some call her baby squirrel 
 Like cash money benjamins I'm in the zone off that chrome in yo 
 Residence look like I'm skatin, big ballin 'n' heavy weightin the 
 Trunk rida 'n' look at that the speaker's quakin and I ain't fakin 
 Like half the rappers in da nation so many trees look at the leaves 
 That I be rakin and like inflation I'm bubblin up to get the bacon 
 With the poundin and the gang 'n' drink while y'all procastin 
 I'm off the cova yeah a fighta and a lova you want some sauce come

 And my trunks on pop, chop chop you know it don't stop the 
 Spreewells keep spinnin and my trunks on pop and I stay ridn 
 Clean, driven screens yellow diamonds all on my ring keep some 
 Style on my team speed under my driver seat diamonds spinnin 
 Like my head after I dicoptined lucky I don't spend the rent 
 Tell them folks to cut a check likes to get floss on 
 I'm a boss son ten thousand on chrome paper grew 'n' died long 
 I ain't fuckin' with it boy pimpin' been pimpin' long rims paid 
 Fo J.O.B in A-town I don't rest in gettin' chips outta strippa 
 Mexicans stay dough 'n' da game ain't free wheels spin like ceilin fans 
 Wood grain up in my hand pocket full of benjamens 
 You spend as much on tires cause you don't want beef with my ese 
 These ain't no babynay shoes this is chingo bling shoes so 
 Baby mama wipe me down my wet back with tissues go to old school 
 Had to throw some urnge on dat hoe bought a 18 wheeler 
 Had to throw some birds on dat hoe this 'n' like that each wheel on relax 
 Ain't no masa like that with the last name on the back got the 4 folks 
 Pokin candy paint soakin H-town to Mexico back of the oakland at night time 
 I'm lookin' I got my cowboy hat grill is warm stove and oven masa I'm a 
 Double that they lookin' for 'cause they don't like beaners how much naga can 
 I pull if I ride these spinna's
