 Hey baby girl, I've been watching you all day (all day x3) 
 Man that thing you got behind you is amazing (amazing x3) 
 You make me want to take you out and let it rain (let it rain x3) 
 I know you got a man but this is what you should say 
 Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never lookin' back again 
 You found somebody who does it better than he can 
 No more making you cry, no more them gray skies 
 Girl we flying on the G5 G5 
 And we're leavin' never lookin' back again 
 So call your shawty and tell him you found a new man 
 The one who's so so fly, the one that keep you high 
 Have me singing all night like like 
 Oh oh oh oh (repeat) man she gon' be singin' 
 Oh oh oh oh oh (repeat)

 Man I'll put my money (money) where my mouth is (mouth is x3) 
 'Cause you're the baddest little thing that I've ever seen (ever seen x3) 
 So Ima ask you one time if you got a man 
 Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never lookin' back again 
 You found somebody who does it better than he can
