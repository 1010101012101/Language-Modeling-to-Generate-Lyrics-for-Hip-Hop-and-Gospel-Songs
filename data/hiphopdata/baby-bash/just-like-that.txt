(Chorus: Play - slowed down) 
 Do it like that 
 Just like that 
 Do it, do it like that 
 Just like that 
 Do it like that 
 Just like that 
 Bounce it from the back 
 Let me hit it from the {back} 
 (Verse 1: Baby Bash) 
 No worries, no rush, mama, take your time 
 Bumpin' that booty way down in line 
 I'm a freak, of the week, I ain't playin' no games 
 When it comes to money makin', know your top notch games 
 She wanna add me to her life, like a MySpace friend 
 'Cause I kill it from the {back} and keep her body shakin' 
 Mama Doogie like that, bubba one more time 
 And when you shake it, don't fake it, Beezy blow my mind 
 I just got a {back} from my cousin Jesus 
 And now she way loose off the grey and the goose 
 And she don't play, and I don't play, I'm a put this out on blast 
 I update, that cupcake, boss up like Johnny Cash 
 I know she tell her friends 
 Her friends gon' tell they friends 
 And when they see me, they gon' know what I'm carrying 
 I'm an ice cold Mexican, hell yeah, I do it Gonzo 
 In the back of the Escalanzo, me and her gon' do it pronto 
 (Baby Bash: slowed down) 
 Short skirts and high heels 
 Short skirts and high heels 
 Short skirts and high heels 
 Yeah, get it, get low 
 Short skirts and high heels 
 Short skirts and high heels 
 Short skirts and high heels 
 Yeah, get it, hit the floor 
 We gon' boss up, boy, we gon' boss up 
 We gon' boss up, boy, we gon' boss up 
 We gon' boss up, boy, we gon' boss up 
 We gon' boss up, boy, we gon' boss up
