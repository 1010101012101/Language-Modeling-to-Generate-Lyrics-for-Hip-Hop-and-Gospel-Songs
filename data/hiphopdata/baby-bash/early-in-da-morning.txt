 Bustin' bigger nuts than peter pan and jiffy

 Hit it for so strong, and hold up for so long 
 I'm a rip, I'm a run, roll tha whole blunt 
 Grab the visine, I'm feelin' so crunk 
 Check my watch, connect my dots 
 Scratch my crotch, jump in tha the flip flops 
 All I hear is pots and pans with da sizzle 
 Chorizo con huevos, man it's off da hizzle 
 Chockin' on dat residue
