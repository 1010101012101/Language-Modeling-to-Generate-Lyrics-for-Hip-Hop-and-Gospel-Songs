Check check ...this happened for real ...baby bash... yo... frankie j... obsession) 
 But its early in the mornin 
 And my heart is feeling lonely 
 Just thinking bout my baby got me twisted in my be 
 And I don't know how to take 
 But its driving me so crazy 
 It don't know if its right I'm tossin turning in my bed 
 Its 5 oclock in the morning 
 And I still can't sleep 
 Thinkin' 'bout your beauty it makes me 
 Weak 
 I'm feeling hopeless at home I don't know what to do I think I'm in love Baby... 
 Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love) 
 Than what am I feeling, what am I doing wrongggggg 
 Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love) 
 Its just an illusion that I have in my heart 
 Now I know you're not my lady but I'm tryin' to make this right 
 I don't know what to do I'm going out of my mind 
 So baby if you let me get 
 It witchu then well maybe we could ride together 
 We could do this all night now I don't care if you got a man 
 Baby I wish you'd understand 
 'Cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can 
 Its 5 oclock in the morning 
 And I still can't sleep 
 Thinkin' 'bout your beauty it makes me 
 Weak 
 I'm feeling hopeless at home I don't know what to do I think I'm in love Baby... 
 Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love) 
 Than what am I feeling, what am I doing wrongggggg 
 Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love) 
 Its just an illusion that I have in my heart 
 I love the way you freak it like that 
 I love the way you freak it like that 
 I love the way you freak it like that 
 It's an obsession 
 (Baby Bash) 
 Hold up let me dream 
 Shorty got me feelin' serene 
 Where my candy, where my cream 
 Got your boy feel less supreme 
 Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent 
 Loving everything your representing 
 Got alot of money, I love to spend it 
 And that's what's up and I don't care what people scream 
 No I'm blessin when I'm stressin 
 My superfly beauty queen 
 I'm gonna keep it saucy 
 'Cause my ma know how I do, we go rendezvous, MI CORAZON BELONGS TO YOU
