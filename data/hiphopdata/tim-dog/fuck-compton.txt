Oh shit mutherfuckas step to the rear and cheer 
 'Cause Tim Dog is here 
 Let's get down to the nitty gritty 
 And talk about a bullshit city 
 Talking about niggaz from Compton 
 They're no comp and they truly ain't stomping 
 Tim Dog a black man's task 
 I'm so bad I'll whip Superman's ass 
 All you suckers that rif on the West Coast 
 I'll dis and spray your ass like a roach 
 Ya think you're cool wit your curls and your shades 
 I'll roll thick and you'll be yelling raid 
 One hard brother that lives in New York 
 Where brothers are hard and we don't have to talk 
 Shut your mouth before we come out stomping 
 Hey, yo Eazy -- Fuck Compton! 
 Fuck Compton! 
 Fuck Compton! (Yeah) 
 Fuck Compton! (Ah, yeah) 
 Fuck 'em! 
 (Why you dissing Eazy?) 
 'Cause the boy ain't shit 
 Chew him with tobacco, an' spit him in shit 
 I crush Ice Cube, I'm cool wit Ice T 
 But NWA ain't shit to me 
 Dre --- beating on Dee from "Pump it Up"? 
 Step to the Dog and get fucked up! 
 I'm simplistic, imperialistic, idealistic 
 And I'm kicking ballistics 
 Having that gang war 
 We want to know what you're fighting for 
 Fighting over colors? 
 All that gang shit is for dumb motherfuckers! 
 But you go on thinking you're hard 
 Come to New York and we'll see who gets robbed! 
 Take your jheri curls, take your black hats 
 Take your wack lyrics and your bullshit tracks 
 Now you're mad and you're thinking about stomping 
 Well I'm from the South Bronx, Fuck Compton! 
 Fuck Compton! (Yeah) 
 Fuck Compton! (Yeah, haha) 
 Fuck Compton! 
 Fuck 'em! 
 (Yo, It's about time we had someone from the South Bronx picking on the wack-ass rappers from Compton. Y'Know what, man? We really ain't shit!) 
 Tim Dog and I'm the best from the East 
 And all this Compton shit must cease 
 So keep your eyes on the prize and 
 Don't jeopardize my arrive 'cause that's not wise 
 You really think that you can rhyme 
 Well come and get some of this loaded tech-nine 
 Bo bo bo shots are cold gunning 
 And you'll really be 
 100 Miles and Running 
 You wanna play go ride in a sleigh 
 I'm so large I fuck Michel le' 
 In the bathroom we was boning 
 You shoulda heard how the bitch was moaning 
 "Do do do do dooo do do do do do do do" 
 Shut the fuck up bitch, you can't sing 
 Ya sound like a kid playing on a swing (Fuck you!) 
 I'm the man at hand to run the band 
 That's in command 
 You know who the fuck I am 
 Tim Dog! What's my motherfucking name? 
 Tim Dog! That's my motherfucking game 
 So whether you think that I'm just a myth 
 That riff 
 The lift 
 The gift 
 The if 
 The fifth' 
 The shift 
 The spliff 
 That's in control 
 To hold 
 To fold 
 To bold 
 And make 
 And ache 
 And take 
 And fake 
 Wooh! and I'm still too great 
 Fuck Compton! 
 Fuck Compton! (Yeah) 
 Fuck Compton! (yeah) 
 Yeah, this a little something to let you know that you West Coast rappers ain't taking over, 'cause I'm straight out the South Bronx, and we ain't having that shit! Tim Dog! Peace out! 
 Fuck 'em!
