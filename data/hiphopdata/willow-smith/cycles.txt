Ain't tryna rock no boats 
 Ain't tryna step on no toes 
 Ain't tryna bust no bowls 
 But I'm just trying to get home 
 'Cause the moon is bright, the sheets are dark 
 The kids in the alley, they're howling 
 I walk the streets, trying to find a place to sit 
 A person to talk to 
 But all I have is you, this ghost inside my brain 
 I'm lost in the light 
 I'm feeling really bright 
 I don't wanna spend the night 
 I just want a cool breeze, warm stream while we're looking at the trees 
 I'm howling, I'm howling 
 Lost in the night 
 I really wanna cry 
 I don't sleep at night 
 I'm going out with those kids, we're howling, we're howling 
 Kids, we do what is right 
 We do what is wrong 
 But what is right? 
 Please explain to me what is wrong 
 We do what we feel 
 We make our own path 
 Hop out now 
 We're the indigo, we're the indigos and we're all going to another place 
 Not tryna find another name 
 Not tryna get in another body 
 I'm going to ascension, baby you cannot stop me 
 You cannot stop me 
 'Cause the moon is bright, the sheets are dark 
 The kids in the alley, they're howling 
 I walk the streets, trying to find a place to sit 
 A person to talk to 
 But all I have is you, this ghost inside my brain 
 I'm lost in the tide 
 I don't think I can get out 
 I'm swimming from that sharp mouth 
 And that island of the doll is really far away 
 I don't think I will make it at all 
 But I fall 
 With some Atlanteans, Nephilims, the Martians and some Anunnaki, we all fall 
 What happens when we fall? 
 We go down in consciousness and we rise into a light like 
 What the heck is happening? 
 Why am I here? Why can I sing? 
 Why am I across the sea? This is crazy 
 I wanna go home, I wanna go home
