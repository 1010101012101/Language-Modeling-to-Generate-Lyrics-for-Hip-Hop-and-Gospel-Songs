(Nicki) 
 I was on my way to school I do'z me, 
 I hopped out the drop grabbed my juicy, 
 I hopped, skipped and jumped past the hoopdies, 
 But, wait I forgot to grab my loose leaf. 
 I doubled right back b-back like who's that? 
 I did a little dance like cat b-boom cat. 
 I love how the jocks be watchin me me, 
 So I grab my crouch and say he he! 
 I be like bum's diggety dumb when I pop my gum, 
 They lookin' dumb diggety dumb, 
 Think they stopping something 
 I said excuse me honey, 
 I'm b-bugs bunny, 
 Elmer Fudd ain't got my ain't got my carrots, 
 He ain't got nothing for me 
 'Cause we the mean girls y-yes we're so fetch, 
 And when we in the yard be jumping double dutch. 
 We back to the future, pearl ya wit da best

 Imma get more shine than a little bit 
 Soon as I hit the stage applause I'm hearing it 
 Whether it's black stars, black cars, I'm feeling 
 But can't none of them whip it like I do

 When they see me pull up I whip it real hard, 
 I whip it real hard (whip it whip it) 
 Real hard, I whip it real hard 
 (Whip it, Whip it real hard)

 Keep my head up, I know I'll be fine 
 Keep fighting until I get there
