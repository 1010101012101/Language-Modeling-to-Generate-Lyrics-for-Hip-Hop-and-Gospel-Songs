So, hum... 
 Take the money, take the fame 
 All I want is truth 
 You talk their language 
 Play their games 
 Act as they want to 
 Look at you 
 Look at you 
 Who are you? 
 Who are you? 
 You walk the streets aimlessly 
 The density is rain 
 The thoughts you think just cause you pain 
 And don't make you more free 
 What to do? Woe is you? 
 What to do? Who are you? 
 You criticize behind those eyes 
 No hatred you're just jealous 
 Your subconscious is not conscious 
 To poison your ingestin' 
 Woe is you? 
 Who are you? 
 It's your choice 
 Just make the move 
 Burning bridges 
 Burning bridges 
 Posies all fall down 
 Now consciousness is all there is and nothingness as well 
 What are we? 
 What to see? 
 My third eye is opening 
 I'm burning bridges 
 Burning bridges 
 Posies all fall down 
 Our consciousness is all that is 
 But nothingness is well 
 What are we? 
 And who are you? 
 Did we just go 
 Down the drain? 
 And I just go with my flow 
 Cause rollin' circles 
 Rollin' circles 
 Rollin' circles 
 The pavement seems too cold 
 And now my feet turn purple 
 (Hey, Willow? What?) 
 Take the money, take the fame 
 All I want is truth 
 You talk their language 
 Play their games 
 Did you forget about 
 Who you were? 
 In the stars 
 Lets go back home 
 This Earth is hard 
 This Earth is all up in the stars 
 The Ursa's hungry he's 
 Just lookin' for a brotha 
 To get started 
 Burning bridges 
 Burning bridges 
 We just fallin' down 
 Our consciousness is nothingness 
 And nothingness is well 
 Who are you? 
 Who am I? 
 Who am I? 
 Where is me? 
 Where is I? 
 There's no "I" 
 It's just all
