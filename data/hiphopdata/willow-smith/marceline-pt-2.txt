I wish I could sleep 
 It looks so peaceful 
 When I'm watching you 
 At night I can see 
 She's beatin', believin' 
 I'm grievin', not many reasons 
 So many seasons, oh 
 Will you stay with me 
 Until the earth runs dry 
 We'll tear it up, we'll tear it up 
 Ice in our veins 
 Love in our still hearts 
 I'm not playin' games 
 And I'm not tryin' to go off 
 Ice in our veins 
 Love in our still hearts 
 We're just playin' games 
 And I'm not gonna go on 
 But why not? 
 Just the thought 
 I don't want to sit here 
 In my doom all day 
 I won't stay, no 
 Stay, stay, no 
 Ice in our veins 
 Love in our still hearts 
 I'm just playin' games 
 And I'm not gonna go off 
 Ice in our veins 
 Love in our still hearts 
 We're just playin' games 
 And I'm not gonna go on 
 Tonight, it's your fault that I'm this way 
 I go through all that pain 
 Just to be alone at the end of the day 
 At the end of the day
