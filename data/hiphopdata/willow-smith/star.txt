Earth, our home 
 Incubator of life 
 Through our lines of life 
 Your recover the knowledge 
 Hidden with our bodies and earth, herself 
 To raise our brothers and sisters 
 To a new state of consciousness 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 I move, you move 
 It's all the same we play these games 
 We play them, we don't think about it 
 'Cause I'm done, I'm done 
 Trying to make it easier, maker it easier 
 For you, because nature's a battle 
 And nobody ever handled it, the way our ancients did 
 My universe 
 Just keeps on growin' and expandin' 
 But you are my star, you are the star 
 In my sky, I encompass your lights 
 I inhabit the divine, I 
 I finally got a piece of mind 
 And I'm holding on really tight 
 And time, time's, time's not waiting 
 For you and I, and I and I and I 
 I'm feeling, I'm feeling 
 That flight tonight 
 To the sky 
 Yeah, I'm talkin' about a flight 
 Into the night, Into the night 
 My universe 
 Just keeps on growin' and expandin' 
 But you are my star, you are the star 
 In my sky, I encompass your lights 
 I inhabit the divine, I 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 My universe 
 Just keeps on growin' and expandin' 
 But you are my star, you are the star 
 In my sky, I encompass your lights 
 I inhabit the divine, I 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 Oh-oh-oh 
 Oh-oh-oh
