I see you, I do 
 Your hands are guiding for who you are to love you 
 I am not sorry for what I do 
 My soul sits tidy in my being 
 I'm all-seeing, all-feeling, all-creating 
 I feel so much love through you 
 You, not so, be in my dream 
 I saw you asleep 
 You make me feel like a cloud of H2O 
 Baby I've seen you before 
 You're dancing softly, oh what do I know? 
 Oh yeah I'm dancing for sure 
 I'm dancing for sure 
 I don't see you often, what do I know? 
 Needing you in the astral realms 
 I can call your dorm room right from my labradorite 
 I know you don't think I'm the right one 
 But all of these energies light 
 And I'm just trying to get like one 
 I feel so much love through you 
 You, not so, be in my dream 
 I saw you asleep 
 I, I, I saw you in my dream 
 I, I, I, I knew you did not see me 
 I, I, I saw you in my dream 
 I, I, I, I knew you did not see me 
 See me 
 See, knew you did not see me 
 See me 
 Knew you did not see me 
 I, I, I, cried, cried 
 Knew you did not see me 
 I, I, I, cried, cried 
 Knew you did not see me 
 Knew you did not see me 
 Knew you did not see me 
 Knew you did not see me
