Mother Earth, praise her light 
 Brothers and sisters, we come here on our two, we are, we are 
 Mother Earth, praise her light 
 (?) 
 Tonight we roll 
 Tonight we roll 
 Tonight we roll 
 Tonight we roll 
 Tonight we roll 
 Tonight we roll 
 Tonight we roll 
 Tonight we roll 
 I don't see you in those woods no more 
 I yearn for you, but you're so far away in your tree home 
 I'm by the obelisk, come and just sneak a kiss 
 All aboard the machine and berserkers running after him 
 Berserkers running through the wind berserkers heart is breaking slow 
 The elders didn't want this and she's running through the forest like 
 Mother Earth, we praise your light 
 Your sisters and brothers 
 We come to honor you 
 Your sisters and brothers 
 We just love in you 
 All the natives of the windy forest 
 Come hither 
 All the natives of the windy forest 
 All the natives of the windy forest 
 Feel the leaves, they're stuck in your pores 
 Feel the leaves, they're stuck in your pores 
 The forest children are making songs 
 And trying to get you to sing along 
 We fly 
 We fly 
 We fly 
 All the natives of the windy forest
