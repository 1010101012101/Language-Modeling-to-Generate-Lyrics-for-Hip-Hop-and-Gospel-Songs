Hello, my neighbor, I surely recognize you 
 Well, all right I suppose, how do you do? 
 So where you at, babe? Yeah me, I've been a refugee too 
 But I know we're can see this through 
 I'll try to keep smiling and stay strong for you 
 Right now, that's all I can do 
 But don't you cry no more unless you really need to 
 Oh and darlin', if you do, you know that I will cry with you 
 If you can hear what I say, we'll cry tears of joy one day 
 We've been as low as we can go, we will rise again I know 
 New Orleans will sing and dance my friend 
 And we'll be together again 
 We'll be among the few those who really knew 
 How it feels to go way below zeron 
 Mama, she's in Texas, no, she ain't feeling well 
 Sissy's in Oklahoma friend and Awlins been through hell 
 Me, I've been in Baton Rouge too close to far, way too homesick blue 
 Just wanna go home and start over again as soon as they'll let me back in 
 I'll try to keep smiling and stay strong for you 
 Over right now, that's all I can do 
 I know some went crazy, I know some done wrong 
 But that's just one verse, it's not the whole song 
 If you've been hungry and thirsty and left alone in the dark 
 You know, madness is contagious, you lose hope's sweet spark 
 Don't you cry no more unless you really need to 
 Oh and darlin', if you do, you know that I will cry with you 
 If you can hear what I say, we'll cry tears of joy one day 
 We'll be in our second line, let the pain go and we'll be fine 
 And New Orleans will sing and dance, my friend 
 We'll be together again 
 We'll be among the few those who really knew 
 How it feels to go way below zeron
