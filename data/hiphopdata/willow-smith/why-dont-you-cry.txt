Why don't you? 
 Why, why, why why don't you cry? 
 Stuck in the mirror 
 Never seeing clearer 
 So open your eyes now 
 It's getting cloudy 
 I see your words, they're tryna get out 
 Tryna get out 
 Why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Why don't you cry? 
 Why don't you cry? 
 Why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Why don't you cry? 
 Why don't you cry? 
 So stuck in the mirror 
 Start getting clearer 
 When I close my eyes, I 
 I can see the sky at night 
 Past the blue and the ozone layer 
 Past the polluted atmosphere 
 Nothing is more important than our connection 
 Me and the mother 
 Singing the universal song 
 Calling each other 
 Why don't we all just sing along? 
 Why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Why don't you cry? 
 Why don't you cry? 
 Why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Why don't you cry? 
 Why don't you cry? 
 Why don't you? 
 Why, why, why don't you cry? 
 Why, why, why don't you? 
 Why, why? 
 Why? 
 Cry! 
 Why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Why don't you cry? 
 Why don't you cry? 
 Why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Why, why, why, why, why, why 
 Why don't you cry? 
 Why don't you cry?
