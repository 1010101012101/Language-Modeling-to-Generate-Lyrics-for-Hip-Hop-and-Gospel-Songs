As I flip through pages of my notepad 
 Wow, I really wanna shine 
 That's what it boils down to, real shit 
 I just want my mind to be free 
 Never mind if they fond of me, I've been a beast 
 I recline in my seat, number nines on my feet 
 Womanizer admittingly, but mind you I'm deep 
 Although they inclined to critique 
 Motherfuck 'em, they couldn't lace up a nigga's Chukka's 
 'Cause money talk and I make them bussa's pay for discussion 
 Chasing duckets, chasing dreams, got me praying for foes 
 Chasing hoes, dick 'em good enough to make 'em propose 
 Winning, the feeling is so incredible 
 Something that's forever true, my niggas over revenue 
 Little bit of Chanel, decorate your appearance 
 Double C's on your purses, perfect I get the message 
 Isabel Marant I get you some, you give me that 
 All of my thoughts fluorescent ink, though I'm always thinking black 
 Sitting back, cognac, sixty-two behind the pack 
 I ain't thug, but I ain't stupid four niggas, five ? hold up 
 Fire shots for the winners 
 And as long as I'm delivering, this genre's gon' be winning 
 Double M-G pimping, my relevance never ending 
 My penmanship ain't too pretty, my ink is why they gon' feel me 
 This ink is why they feel me, this ink is why they feel me 
 This ink is why they feel me, Lord, this ink is why they feel me 
 This ink is why they feel me, this ink is why they feel me 
 This ink is why they feel me, Lord, this ink is why they feel me 
 Double M-G, thank you, this the real me 
 I got a couple old schools and some new girls 
 They like old jewels and new pearls 
 They obey no rules, they some rude girls 
 You know the bad ones that rule the world 
 They just wanna have fun and crash parties 
 But when them games is over they down to ride for me 
 Bonnie and Clyde story, Mick and Mallory 
 A killer in them sheets, they bring that ish up out of me 
 After that I sit and counting G's after G 
 'Cause it's right back to these ends 
 Send her on her way, tell her come back with some friends 
 We can do it all again, the repetition that I like 
 The reputation of a pimp 
 And I do it all on him, peep the way I limp 
 Pimp walk I been brought my chick, it was money well spent 
 They say it's cold-blooded how I talk 
 I been winning this way for years, so what if I ain't lost? 
 This ink is why they feel me, this ink is why they feel me 
 This ink is why they feel me, Lord, this ink is why they feel me 
 This ink is why they feel me, this ink is why they feel me 
 This ink is why they feel me, Lord, this ink is why they feel me 
 Double M-G, thank you, this the real me 
 Sometimes it's like 
 Eyes is low, moment is perfect 
 You see things brighter than you normally see 
 With twenty-twenty, ya know? 
 Enjoy your vice
