GMG 
 Green Lantern on the beat 
 Uncle Murda 
 Oh 
 Anybody can get it 
 And I ain't got a problem takin' care of the witness 
 Money, power, respect 
 For that money, I'll pop whoever in the neck (X2) 
 I bust guns and them drugs I move it 
 Police know what I do, but they can't prove it 
 I'll take your car, music bumpin' like what? 
 I don't know how to drive, I'ma crash your whip up 
 Then jump out the car, look police on my ass 
 I smoke too much, I can't run that fast 
 Then I turn around and start squeezin' at the coppers 
 They all fall back when I pull out that big chopper 
 Lil homie, go ask your big brother 
 He'll tell you I'm the truth, that's word to your mother 
 I hate the cops and I know they hate me 
 I gotta smoke haze so I don't shoot at police 
 GMG for life, and my killas is with me 
 It ain't hard to tell, I run Liberty City 
 Every project and south block in the city 
 They'll tell you listen to Murda, that boy gettin' busy 
 From Broker to Dukes, Bohan to Schottler 
 I got niggas sayin', I already shot ya 
 Yeah I got my fo' fifth, yeah I got a full clip 
 Yeah GMG backin' up on my bullshit 
 I ain't gon' shoot ya leg, or shoot you in the arm 
 I might shoot ya in the head, or shoot ya baby moms 
 I put that work in, but I ain't goin' to prison 
 I don't care 'bout that broad, anybody can get it
