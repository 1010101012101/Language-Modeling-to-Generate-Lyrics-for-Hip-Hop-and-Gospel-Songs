It's Pierce Brosnan, cross you up like Allen Ivey 
 It's Allen Iverson, Versace rims with lemon tint 
 The lime Benz candy, coat it with the applesauce 
 The apple gloss on Miami Beach, David Hasselhoff 
 Hassle me I'm Tim McGraw, I don't pass the ball 
 Ball hard fourth quarter shoot the lights off 
 Fast break, three-on-one I tear the basket off (get off) 
 Aw shit, look who it is the white Wesley Snipes 
 Rocking Byzantine, my attitude is Charlie Sheen 
 Walk around with more rice on me than a triple beam 
 The mansion, three-story living room with trampoline 
 Mi casa so big it took the maids a whole week to clean 
 I don't like to drive Versace jeans in limousine 
 I can freestyle to a dolphin and a tambourine 
 The snow abominable laughing inside my golden vault 
 The Candy Copper Helicopter when I'm playing golf (fore) 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah, hooah, hooah, hooah 
 Yeah, I got bitches by the catalogue playing leapfrog 
 Butt-naked in the livin' room, look like Reese Witherspoon (Real fine classic bitch) 
 What's up? I'm bumping Dean Martin Christmas tunes 
 Every time I open up my email see another million (I'm rich) 
 That bitch wanna suck my dick then she better floss 
 Clean them teeth for a boss, Randy Moss 
 Diamonds on my cross, swear to God I'm a God though 
 I don't mean no blasphemy, Jesus eat at Applebee's 
 I'm with my bitch in the bed watching Game of Thrones 
 Waiting till Khaleesi's dragon's big enough to take control 
 Rich as Vince MacMahon, your bitch look like Triple H 
 Keep that pussy on lock, put it in a safe 
 All my chains on, flexing while I'm shootin' Vines 
 Hoes love me, watching all of them like a million times (replay on that ass) 
 Throwing money in your face, we forever paid 
 These hoes thirsty and I look like pink lemonade 
 Tastes great (tastes great) Grade A (grade A) 
 Grab your bitch take a vaycay (in the Bahamas) 
 Coming at these haters AK (Woo, yeah, I got ya!)
