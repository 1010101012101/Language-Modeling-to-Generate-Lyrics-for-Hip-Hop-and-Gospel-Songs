Q Rich 
 Ice on my wrists and I ball like Q Rich 
 Ice on my wrists and I ball like Q Rich 
 Smoking in the club, have a nicotine fit 
 Ice on my hand and I shoulda won a Grammy 
 Step inside the club and I'm smelling like Miami 
 In the kitchen cooking cookies, but I'm not yo damn granny 
 Now they wanna copy because I'm wetter than tsunami 
 Now they wanna copy because I'm wetter than tsunami 
 Kitchen cooking cookies, but I'm not yo damn granny 
 Step inside the club and I'm smelling like Miami 
 Ice on my hands, should have won a damn Grammy 
 I made a lane, lane made of gold 
 I can shoot a BB through a frosted Cheerio 
 From fifty yards away, I can ride blades 
 I can make it rain even on a sunny day 
 At the Days Inn, still play to win 
 I can buy a Benz even if I ride a Schwinn 
 Twenty inch rims, man that shit's too small 
 Met this bitch at the mall, ass like two volleyballs 
 Supersize the chain, like it was McDonald's 
 Ice a whole frame, snowman, abominable 
 Laughing at the bank, man that shit is comical 
 50 inch Byzantine, damn near froze my abdominal

 Step inside the club and I'm smelling like Miami 
 Ice on my hands, should have won a damn Grammy 
 Who me? You know who I are 
 Might crash my car then buy the whole bar 
 Yea we can talk, don't be a stranger 
 Step inside the club and I smell like Power Ranger 
 Oriental wrists, with the rocks on my finger 
 Ice in my ear, looks like a baby penguin 
 Circle make a square fool, on August 5th 
 Banana bird fists looks like panda piss 
 Should I rock the braids, permed out fur 
 Walking 'round town, rock twenty K below 
 Hyper color chain with the similac flow 
 Rocking all this snow, might freeze a rainbow
