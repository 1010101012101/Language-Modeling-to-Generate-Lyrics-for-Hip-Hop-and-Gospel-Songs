Yo, wanna know something about my right arm? 
 I done flex so hard, I set off fire alarms 
 The fireplace's outta space with a lion's belt 
 Big jewels on myself with the tiger smell 
 Straight out the jungle, sting like kiss 
 Ice real cool, top lip frostbit 
 Cuz now I write Clark Gable on my cable bill 
 Bill Cosby on my couch out in Nashville 
 [Palm?] couch met her orange on the cornfields 
 High fructose concentrated pepper spill [?] 
 She was grabbin' on my schlong doing handstands 
 Hey Julia it's Stiles save the last dance 
 Second glass started, birds in my bottle 
 Only 3 stay forever, that's 10% 
 I can do the math but I choose to take a nap 
 Front yard hovercraft on Versace raft[?] 
 Drowned last week, just friends[?] by palm trees 
 Bitch, I could sing a hook like Alicia Keys 
 New pants, 40 grands on the next land[?] 
 I'm the white Gucci Mane with a spray tan 
 Big bottles don't wait, you shouldn't too 
 What the fuck a wife do? No wedding shoes, no wedding shoes 
 What the fuck a wife do? No wedding shoes, no wedding shoes 
 What the fuck a wife do? No wedding shoes 
 Who you? Who come through doing kung-fu 
 Jinjitsu, eating kung pow when the thunder storm tornado [side-semble?] on my Guess jeans 
 You wanna guest list? You wanna fresh kiss? I gotta double check your French tips 
 Hygiene clean you gene (Eugene)[?] dream I dream shake like a camel after one[?] 
 Diplo trippin' talkin' 'bout 
 "You gotta focus on the lyrics in your songs, a lot is riding on this album" 
 Maaaaan, fuck that gimme piece[?] of chain or medallion 
 Candy-gray Maybach, her ass stay flat 
 "You really shouldn't say that" 
 Man, its Riff Raff 30k or better when I touch stage 
 Girl, I crush the stage, rich kids bum-rush the stage 
 Broke whores get rich too, trade-in Isuzus, buy new friends too, remove tattoos 
 I rock turtleneck in the see-through 
 It's a clear turtleneck cottle-check[?] my Versace Glock in my glove box 
 Make sure that I gotta custom-built house with the waterslide 
 From the top floor to the living room Jacuzzi 
 Electric maid cleans the house Jetson Judy, big booty 
 You can be 18 with some soft hands 
 Aw shit look who it is, it's the Gucci Man with the spray tan 
 Wait, let's go back to the part near the start where you was talkin' 'bout the cleanliness underneath the fingernails 
 Any bad bitches? That's an epic fail, can't do that, who's that, who's who 
 I can ball at the mall, shoot hoops too, whole crew rockin' sus[?] made my Bruce Bruce[?] 
 And my wood wheel[?] is a bruce fruce[?] 
 She had a vibe I could vibe with, thought I was flying had to go sit by the pilot cuz she smelled like Rikers Island 
 Straight mash[?] straight stiff for 'em with a [?] 
 Could I get some RiFF promotion?] or where the fuck my label at? 
 It's Riff Raff here, hit a couple lines of rice cuz I'm tryna get my six-pack back, you should move packs at your preschool 
 No common sense, but I don't sit on the bench, rap game Johnny Bench, who my fans clench[?] 
 Waiting on my chance to ball, waiting on you to fall off softly 
 Used to move ounces through my counselor's office 
 8 ball in my back pocket but I do not play pool 
 Play by the pool, 10 10 beige drool[?] while I lay by the old man, just working on my skin tone/ho[?] 
 The fuck you want respect from the butterscotch boss when I floss, rap game Randy Moss in the cotton candy Buick sittin' on Brazilian gloss 
 Hope you ready for that Neon Icon, it just dropped right now 
 Came through in the Benz bright brown
