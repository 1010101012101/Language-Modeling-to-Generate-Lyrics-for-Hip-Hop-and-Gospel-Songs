My mind goes round like a roundabout 
 Whistles and sings 
 Darker than darkest night 
 Sweeter than spring 
 Yeah mysterious (Mysterious), my mermaids are bi-curious 
 She done got intoxicated, girlfriend is furious 
 Just in case, I pack the paper in the briefcase 
 Rain water, roof taste, Pistol Pete 
 White Louis suitcase, with the singin' hook like Frankie Lymon 
 Shout to the Baywatch, David Hasselhoff hair 
 Or the Allen Iverson braids, zig zags on designer 
 Softened beautiful face with the puzzle piece lineup 
 Edge up, I done got fed up 
 Ate the pork chop sandwich with the tartar sauce 
 In the packet that I found in my purple Prada pocket protector 
 I could say anything about luck, you need to shut the, fuck up 
 Like an addict threw up, I done poured a four in a codeine 
 Sonic the Hedgehog club versus Knuckles in my mailbox cup 
 I done, I done poured a four in a codeine 
 Sonic the Hedgehog club versus Knuckles in my mailbox cup 
 My mind goes round like a roundabout 
 Whistles and sings 
 Darker than darkest night 
 Sweeter than spring 
 Nigga hold up, what is this? 
 You ain't supposed to be here, yeah your name wasn't on that list 
 We even checked the email that was sent from up above, or rather all around us 
 Screams in my dreams like a One Direction concert, so 
 We're on our own, so alone in the universe 
 We sent people to the moon and now we know just the two of us 
 By heart, my art, I don't wanna explain it 
 I knew it, he bullshit, he up his own anus 
 Instagrams with his fans, man, he wish he was famous 
 Stop talking about your heart, we give a fuck, entertain us 
 Why this nigga the lamest, why his clothes so the plainest? 
 And I know the ones who hate us, be the sames to say we made it 
 Man fuck the vindicated, and the faded, at least they influence 
 How do we become the God? Language we learned in fluent 
 Understand who you are, they told us to be patient 
 But it's pointless like the use of emojis in conversation 
 Question mark face 
 What does it mean? 
 It means stay up on your life, focus on them sixteens 
 But they want that fifteen like Sharkeisha and Terio 
 Yeah, you getting your shine, but nigga, are you eating, though? 
 If you're welcome, are you fine? 
 You will 
 Want to love yourself, free your mind 
 We are 
 Turnin' into the god we know 
 I will 
 Never give up hope, we'll be fine 
 My mind goes round like a roundabout 
 Whistles and sings 
 Darker than darkest night 
 Sweeter than spring 
 My mind expands to a great degree 
 A feeling that must be free 
 All that's left is you and me 
 And you're gone
