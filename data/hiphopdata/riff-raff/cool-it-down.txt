I love for sure how you look, yeah 
 I'll run the way to the sky, oh 
 I'm never coming down 
 Tryna keep my cool, neck full of jewels 
 Been grinding twenty years like a damn fool 
 Everything I own I done worked for 
 No kids, no wife, no child support 
 You think this life is luck? No shortcuts 
 If I could I'd live my life inside a tour bus 
 I could remember being 19, nice dreams 
 Nightmares, crystal stares, they don't like me 
 Flashback '94 Honda Hatchback 
 Had to pull these streets away from the club cause the windshield cracked 
 Fast throttle, 'course I drive the black Porsche 
 Everything inside my closet I done paid for 
 You say that I'm not the one 
 That I can't stunt 
 That I didn't grind 
 Always wanna stunt my shine 
 I ain't feeling fine 
 Need me a glass of wine, so I can cool it down 
 You say that I'm not the one 
 That I can't stunt 
 That I didn't grind 
 Always wanna stunt my shine 
 I ain't feeling fine 
 Need me a glass of wine, so I can cool it down 
 I love for sure how you look, yeah 
 I'll run the way to the sky, oh 
 I'm never coming down 
 Yeah, glacier berry watch, got time froze 
 I done, I done shook dice with Pete Rose 
 Crew cut, top peeled back like a nice orange 
 I used to shoot jumpers with precise form 
 They wanna tell you what you can't do based on formal facts 
 If I wanted to hear that bullshit I'd be in history class 
 If I'd have been around you five minutes I'd need a six pack 
 If I would've listened to your bitch ass I wouldn't be Riff Raff 
 You say that I'm not the one 
 That I can't stunt 
 That I didn't grind 
 Always wanna stunt my shine 
 I ain't feeling fine 
 Need me a glass of wine, so I can cool it down 
 You say that I'm not the one 
 That I can't stunt 
 That I didn't grind 
 Always wanna stunt my shine 
 I ain't feeling fine 
 Need me a glass of wine, so I can cool it down 
 I love for sure how you look, yeah 
 I'll run the way to the sky, oh 
 I'm never coming down
