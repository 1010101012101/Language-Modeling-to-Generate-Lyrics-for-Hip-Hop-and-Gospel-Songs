As the days keep turning 
 As the world keeps burning 
 As my soul keeps learning 
 Tears fall from the castles around my heart 
 As the days keep turning 
 As the world keeps burning 
 As my soul keeps learning 
 Tears fall from the castles around my heart 
 Paperboy, top noise 
 Now I'm in Chinatown, bok choy 
 Should've took a pill, Clamicil 
 The way I ball that I could've played for Vanderbilt 
 When they talk me down 
 They gotta speak up 
 When they say my name Jody 
 They talking bout Jody 
 Talking Jody Highroller 
 I keep the syrup in my soda 
 As the days keep turning 
 As the world keeps burning 
 As my soul keeps learning 
 Tears fall from the castles around my heart 
 As the days keep turning 
 As the world keeps burning 
 As my soul keeps learning 
 Tears fall from the castles around my heart 
 When I wake up, it's a mystery 
 Every time I open my mouth, history 
 2K13 dreams in a limousine 
 The world burns slow, kerosene 
 Candle wax melts, in my fortress 
 I sit alone, my heart stoned 
 My thoughts get assorted 
 I know you can't afford it 
 Jody, Highroller 
 As the days keep turning 
 As the world keeps burning 
 As my soul keeps learning 
 Tears fall from the castles around my heart 
 As the days keep turning 
 As the world keeps burning 
 As my soul keeps learning 
 Tears fall from the castles around my heart 
 As the days keep turning 
 As the world keeps burning 
 As my soul keeps learning 
 Tears fall from the castles around my heart 
 As the days keep turning 
 As the world keeps burning 
 As my soul keeps learning 
 Tears fall from the castles around my heart
