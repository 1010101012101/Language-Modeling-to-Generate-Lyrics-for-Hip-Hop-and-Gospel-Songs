I brought out the rice 
 They were down to play 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 I brought out the rice 
 They were down to play 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 They call me Johnny Quest 
 And it's a nice night 
 The ice bright 
 And they brighter than a lightning strike 
 The lightning coast, glide a coast, the Pacific coast 
 I run the keys to Jamaica, Usain Bolt 
 I make a boat and throw some bragging in the Aston Martin 
 A lot of shit up on my chest, Dolly Parton 
 The iPhone got Carson Daley on the karaoke 
 My skin tone same colour as the French toast 
 I brought out the rice 
 They were down to play 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 I brought out the rice 
 They were down to play 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 Dangleberry hop, breaking in the bird flop 
 Aw shit look who it is the white Chris Rock 
 I then done spent a grand on a ham steak 
 I could charge you ten grand for a handshake 
 Maybe twenty K on a show and tell 
 Now it's KL, Taco Bell 
 I'm stacking up my cheese like a taco shell 
 I'm sliding through your city on a turtle shell 
 I brought out the rice 
 They were down to play 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 I brought out the rice 
 They were down to play 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 I need it, I want it 
 I would do anything for it 
 It brings my life enjoyment 
 Up all night to the early morning 
 I need it, I want it 
 I would do anything for it 
 It brings my life enjoyment 
 Up all night to the early morning 
 I brought out the rice 
 They were down to play 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 I brought out the rice 
 They were down to play 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 We were up all night on cocaine 
 Up all night to the early morning 
 Up all night to the early morning 
 Up all night to the early morning 
 I would do anything for it 
 It brings my life enjoyment 
 Up all night to the early morning 
 I need it, I want it 
 I would do anything for it 
 It brings my life enjoyment 
 Up all night to the early morning
