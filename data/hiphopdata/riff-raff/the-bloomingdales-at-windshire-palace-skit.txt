Ah-ah-hem, Ah-ah-hem Tinsley 
 I do say what a lovely evening we have thus forth 
 I've partaken in many feasts, but these festivities have been of the best 
 Ah! Miss Clementine how are you? 
 Yeah, oh it's a lovely day in jolly, jolly old Saint Pottersville 
 It's just moseying on downon down the epic trail of life, as opposed to the- 
 Nice Bloomingdales, how are they Bloomingdales? Ah! Ah, so- so pretty 
 Ah I appreciate it 
 Oh, I appreciate the wine you gave me last night it was quite-, it was the quite the fancy! 
 It was quite the fancy for me and the family 
 Oh just-, just a thick of a day 
 My grandfather just knitted some stockings! 
 Yes he did! 
 What is the moseying on? Let's go over here and have tea and crumpets 
 And just go back to over to our little cave holes 
 Just a poster for the breads, it's a two for one special here, y'see? 
 It's just a two for one special, it's just a big two for one 
 It's just a big stupid two for one special 
 I mean it is a ridiculous amount of two for one specials
