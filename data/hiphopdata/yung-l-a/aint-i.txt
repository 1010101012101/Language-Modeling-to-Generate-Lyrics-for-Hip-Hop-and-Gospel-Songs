Yung L.A. 
 Ya got to know the boy futuristic ay 
 My work can make the j's do the jumpman can't it? 
 You got to know this the remix right here 
 Grand hustle baby it's the kings right here 
 You got to know we gwappin' pockets extra sloppy 
 Don't I love my vegetables extra cheese and broccoli 
 Don't Yung LA like to kick it like karate 
 Don't I be with j-money servin' everbody 
 Ain't we up in magic city throwin' up the broccoli 
 Ain't me and tip takin' off like a rocket 
 Ain't my ain't my ain't my ain't my ain't my money long 
 Ain't I ain't I ain't I ain't I still puttin' on 
 Ain't I (x7) 
 Ain't I smokin' strong, 
 Ain't I puttin' on, ain't I rockin' yays, ain't my money long 
 Ain't I (x7) 
 Ain't I in the ville, ain't I on the hill, ain't I on a pill, ain't I ain't I real 
 Young Dro

 Remix Yung L.A. and T.I. this a banga 
 Dro you on that thang you don't hear me trick ain't I 
 Big roll royces ain't I got 'em nauseous 
 We be in ferraris the cars wit the horses 
 Ain't I on a pill ridin' down Bentley 
 Iced 30 below minus the wind chill

 Young Droooo 
 T.I. 
 Ralph Lauren Purple label 
 Ain't I fresh as I can be 
 Made it through my situation 
 Ain't I blessed as I can be 
 Ain't I laughin' at these haters tryna take a shot at me 
 They don't know which way to go I make it easy follow me 
 Honestly ain't I insane I think that's the way I gotta be 
 Ain't I so so supafly boy ain't nobody hot as me 
 Ain't T.I. all on TV when he wake up and go to sleep 
 Everywhere they notice me ay for yourself just go and see 
 My community I'm servin' though they hope I don't succeed 
 Hear me speak and so intrigued (ain't he snitchin) no indeed 
 You come in with that common folk yo show I have to commandeer 
 Since I see you can't take ova I'll just have to volunteer 
 Ain't I you superior listen here brah you not up here 
 I'm so zone 1 tip it ain't funny twice the G that I appear 
 Rep bankhead so loud and clear 
 Gon be gone for 'bout a year 
 So paper trail you gotta hear 
 But ain't that ain't I outta here ay
