(Chubb rock) 
 All attention to all of the, lyrical swigs 
 Whether you studio switch or you're, synching a gig 
 Yes! I address to all the known known factors 
 Where you slave to the rhythm of con-trolling the masters 
 I. smythe, whether you drive a benz or a bike 
 Whether you straight hit or you go strictly dyke 
 Dick van, no drugs I only snort dristan 
 And I point to the sister, and yes I can can 
 A, gangsta lean get funky like a latrine and 
 Lyrics scream deep into the +roots+ like ben vereen 
 Rockin', the apple, since the mayor were (?) 
 I smacked double platinum, or hit gold watch 
 I'll achieve, notoriety just like (?) 
 Squad squeeze, but they can mingle with the breeze 
 But hey, parlay - you don't know my way 
 These are the games we play... 
 Hey, hey, hey (hey hey) 
 These are the games we play 
 "I don't know what else to say" -> biggie smalls 
 (Chubb rock) 
 Journalists script shit, that gets me kind of pissed 
 No real award given to the, funkiest hits and 
 Lyrics get prolific and, kids start to sip it 
 Esophagus start bulge, specific and centrific 
 Get a dollar, if I sell more than the group abba 
 The source critics still want to diss my yabba, dabba-da-doo 
 The pulse that revived the crash crew 
 If I'm rockin', on the ra-a-adio eww 
 Why they, can't downgrade but if they try 
 I rock from brooklyn to that crooked-letter-i 
 I, my temper, I remember starts to boil 
 The (? ?) but happy that the heads stayed loyal 
 The groove hits the ground from the maker of "get down" 
 Peace love and all that shit plus five pound 
 Buy hey, parlay - you don't know my way 
 These are the games we play... 
 (Chubb rock) 
 Mo hits the beat then chubb handles the rappin' 
 The un-thinkable flow is fly plus extra napkins 
 And the girls 'pon flatbush look stush without my googles 
 And look as they squint then I blink push up the throttle 
 I, meet this to eat this i, leave this to beavis 
 If I wanna smoke ya spliff I might get, stiffer than penis 
 Ooh, I had to go and rip your whole crew 
 With freeze love ran land butt rub and blue ooh 
 Dippi - dippi dip on you 
 With all my niggaz and squads and the, funkiest jew 
 Ar-tistic lift it start the trend to the phonics 
 And, funk all pure lyrics that turn to alcoholics 
 Ghetto tales, start to prevail the shit 
 Whether you're east west miami bass blood or crip 
 But hey, hey, you don't know my way 
 These are the games we play...
