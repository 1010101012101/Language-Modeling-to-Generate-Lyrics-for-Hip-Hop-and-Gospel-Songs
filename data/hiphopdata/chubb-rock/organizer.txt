"No one can do it better" 
 (Chubb Rock) 
 You see that black man over there, bring him here 
 You see the one with the blunt, put him in the front 
 'Cause it's time to prepare, some kind of strategy this year 
 It's only been about ten million months 
 That we were lost in the sauce 
 But of course with the help of the boss 
 We prevail and now we're on this positive scale 
 But now it's time to take it one step further 
 Preferably without any obvious murders 
 If you don't ?? I don't give a shit 
 If you do it to a man of our shade 
 You definitely played, yourself and us 
 And then the heritage crust will be crushed to puss 
 Cause of your lust that you must just bust 
 A man of your own kind, you must be blind 
 Archie Bunker and Joey's gonna snuff ya from behind 
 One day - 'cause we easy prey to get 
 It's not a threat place a bet recollect the terms met 
 Many years ago that we're inferior 
 And inferior people shouldn't know they're really superior 
 And yo - it's time to listen, tick-tock, tick-tock 
 Comin' from Chubb Rock so check the clock and organize! 
 (Malcolm X) 
 Anytime you look at yourself 
 Be you black, brown, red or yellow 
 A so-called negro 
 You are you represent a person 
 Who poses, such a serious problem for America 
 Because you're not wanted
