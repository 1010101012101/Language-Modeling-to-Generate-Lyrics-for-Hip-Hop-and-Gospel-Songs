 For my, introduction in eighty-six I was lethal 
 Rockin' for the grassroots and up keep the people 
 The movement of the bowel from that lay shit of the vowel 
 Mad share yeah, from mr. (?) with the growl 
 The party's mad dead until I care to appear 
 Kids wanna know where the hell I been for the past year 
 No beer or no parka nike gear no wear or tear 
 The new mic holder who causes, any fair 
 Some max and relax then mellow then strive 
 Shock-value MC's goin' platinums with lies 
 The neophytic critics, who need big bats to hit it 
 They zone with the metronome clone to dome split it 
 When I joke around like zog, rename them is like fog 
 I can flow digital, though my style is analog 
 I, base my career upon these years of how I've strived 
 Three years gone but I will survive, ha

 Ha ha, ha ha 
 Now this "east vs. west," one contest was a taste 
 "Crooklyn dodgers" and that libation, touched the fan base 
 A little, always scared in the place I scare any new rival 
 Past years missin' dissin scripting up this new bible 
 I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno 
 I'm not a puerto rican or some black nigga who's peakin 
 The lyrics are abundant, dirty fat blue beats are pungent 
 And now we gotta see how hot, will the son get 
 I'm a lyrical defamer, like gloria I'm a gaynor 
 In the music biz I opened up more doors than kramer 
 My anthology's available, so buy up the archive 
 Three years gone but I will survive

 For the duration... 
 Overzealous inhabitants flock with abundance 
 Paying tribute, to the one the circumfrence 
 Of the stadium, is paying homage, to my cranium 
 The sea of heads doesn't seem to hide the lady 
 In the back row, waving her hands for the oh 
 The usual crowd rock line for a show 
 And I dispense with the usu-al, and keep it coastin 
 To boom up the set my advice is take a motion 
 Before you walk through the door, of a chubb rock tour 
 Buy the anthology in any store 
 Frontin, now we'll have ya, tougher than mutton 
 If I touch your button you'll start kick like charles dutton 
 Lyrics persevere and you really must strive 
 Three years gone but I will survive 
 I... i... I will will, survive, now ho!
