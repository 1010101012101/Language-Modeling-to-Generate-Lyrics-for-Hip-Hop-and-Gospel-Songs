(Verse one) 
 Here we go, ha ha 
 Thou shalt not have no other great one but me 
 Transcribin my lyrics is the c-h-u-b 
 The lyrics that you hear is not his but mine 
 While, biblical words don't need to ra-hyme 
 I said, "let there be a light," and there was light 
 And the breeze (?), like that kid who made "i-ight" 
 But men took mad dominion, over men 
 Hard bondage with backs and, knees that must bend 
 But only in prayer, I make your head need ibuprof'/bayer 
 Call me, the number one player 
 But hey... the one pharoahes, parlayed 
 In the land of egypt, when that slave shit behaved 
 Bythia (?) drew me, from the nile to smile on the people 
 After me there will be a sequel 
 And I'll praise my name, in the jam 
 Call me what you want, but I am what I am 
 (Verse two) 
 Hehe, I live in the souls of men, and women 
 And pilgrims and children who wiggle, to the rhythm 
 Just go, the people have corrupted themselves 
 They toke the devil's smoke, puffing their l's 
 I'll send, my only son down, to bless you 
 And observe how you know him, and that will test you 
 Years, of sufferation, will burn the nation 
 With adultery, skirt-chasin and crotch-blazin' 
 You never learn - look how many times I kilt ya 
 I burnt ya, I drowned ya, I froze ya 
 I stripped your land and destroyed ya culture 
 Next time you better give me some 
 R-e-s-p-e (c-t) now hold ya but I love ya 
 I invented aids but also, invented the rubber 
 Each one teach one brother 
 Take my name in vain and you're gone like damn 
 Call me what you want, but I am what I am 
 (Verse three) 
 Ha ha 
 Now you got light skin, dark skin, east coast, west coast 
 Old school, new school, dumb-ass fools 
 One land, one people, I am the one 
 Figure you disobeyed so I made the word "nigger" 
 You can change the diction, but can't change what I'm writin 
 I script those pulitzer books for that kid, michael crichton 
 Like {*tch tch tch*} I am the hi-hat 
 I am the m-i-c, I am easy mo bee 
 And easy mo is me, he gets down when I want him to get down 
 I put the heights in the crown 
 I wrote the dead sea scrolls, I'm "strictly business" 
 I made erick and parrish go gold 
 My crew is tan, darker than tan, I made the ku klux klan 
 I made rush +def+ but, able to +jam+ 
 I'm flam, and I'm intricate 
 You must and should be a fan and I am what I am 
 (Verse four) 
 The praise of the "goodfella" is long past done 
 Deniro's an actor, on cue, totin a gun 
 Action! forty-five colt bolt, it gets messy 
 Then copycat murders flow to joe schmoe pesci 
 Then the ladies, sex, to the break of dawn and 
 Another quaalude, and she'll love me in the mornin 
 Fast pace, "scarface," you can't win, god's race 
 When you're sparkin noah's ark, and you're in god's place 
 Baby - cock up your foot and you act crazy 
 Every "distinguished gentleman" wants a lady 
 You can't bug, when you wanna play real life cocoa 
 When you're "down and out in beverly hills" with oprah 
 "Mi vida loca," and then it turns to weed smokers 
 Then you're dead, dealin' with them kids from +cosa nostra+ 
 But no autographs you must, already be a fan 
 I am what I am and that's all that I am
