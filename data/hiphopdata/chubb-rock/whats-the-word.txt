(Minister Farrakhan) 
 Mr. Bush, you better check out your OWN part 
 In the divine drama. You may find YOU the Devil! 
 (Chubb Rock) 
 Listen... cause in 1990 
 Chubb Rock and the gang is on a banned mission 
 Hostility will rule like a Jamaican ?? 
 And ooh filled with dumplings, hopefully no dumpings 
 Like guns will be present while I keep the people jumpin' 
 Not too much, South Africa isn't free yet 
 I spoke to the kids from Brooklyn to T-Neck 
 New Jersey, and they heard me while I cursed the 
 White minority regime, painted an ill scene 
 Brothers and sisters over there dyin' 
 Mandela in a cell in Robin Island 
 Thank God he's out now - and while I sing 
 I know he has things in a full swing, yeah 
 This year crumb-snatcher Thatcher, we're gonna catch her 
 Being a klutz, her husband is a drunk putz 
 He acts absurd, now what's the word?
