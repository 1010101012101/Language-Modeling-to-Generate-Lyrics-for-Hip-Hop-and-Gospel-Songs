The night time is an ill time cause nuff crime 
 Happens that never gets aired on the prime 
 TV stations, public relations 
 Gives the okay for what gets aired in the nation 
 You got the whole world lookin' at "I Love Lucy" 
 Talented bitches on the corner sellin pussy 
 A variety'll give your friend for a 10=spot... 
 ... Christians doin' rimshots! 
 Do more heads than barbershops will 
 Open their legs to the public for a meal 
 Damn it's a shame, the shit looks unreal 
 College graduates sometime kneel 
 Check out the crack scene over there 
 Those two motherfuckers gonna make about a million this year 
 Sell to their friends for a Benz 
 Kill their race for a taste 
 For what they call or see as being the good life 
 Gold nuggets, lots of ducats 
 Beeper number 1-800-Asshole 
 Sellin stone so we can see your bones 
 Cause most crackheads don't have fat legs 
 Skull all soft, it can crack like eggs 
 You fiend for the flavor, steal for the hit 
 Grandma's walkin' home, so you bust her shit 
 Send her to the hospital - for twenty bucks 
 Beam for a half an hour - that's fucked 
 Other (?) your high, for a few stay low 
 Ten minutes later, you need some blow 
 So you'll eventually croak - maybe by a stroke 
 You don't want the good life - no you want coke 
 Now come the robbers, they just steal 
 They move like cats - some on crack 
 They'll vic anything up to Jeeps 
 These motherfuckers play for keeps 
 They'll do anything that's on their mind 
 They come nine deep, plus pack nines 
 They don't care - won't shed no tears 
 Don't try to appeal for pity 'cause it's silly 
 They wear Polo coats, baseball caps 
 The elderly is the main course and the snack 
 These young kids that leave their cribs 
 Hang on the streets, then these squids 
 Slide up on the scene with a certain lean 
 And then slide out but they're countin' your green 
 And now you're vexed and you want to redeem 
 But it's a different world with different rules: 
 The night scene
