Four out of... ten murders... are love related 
 Keep your 'ood, in-a your pants 
 And dese tings won't 'appen to you 
 Check out da bwoy-a-story 
 (Chubb Rock) 
 Tell him! Excuse me, I beg your pardon 
 Inform him, that Chubb is playin' in your secret garden 
 'Cause he didn't cut - the lawn, correctly 
 I have a green thumb, you're not dumb, that's why you sweat me 
 You wanna have your cake and eat it too, so do I 
 You're sneaking around, we're sneaking around, so why 
 Do you wanna continue, comin' to every venue 
 You don't tell him, I'll offend you 
 This ain't right so put him down on the scoop 
 That you're a blow-up sex doll for every group 
 Where are the footsteps that you followed 
 Tippy-toed to my crib and did me a solid 
 You answered every question I ever had 
 On the female anatomy - after you sat on me 
 Cheating is more serious than the taking of pellum (?) 
 So tell him, before I tell him
