(Chubb Rock) 
 Yo, keep in the street let the groove stay rough 
 Rougher than rough, ignorance is enough 
 On the media tip, so that the read must grip 
 On reality, don't let 'em gas up your mentality 
 This style started from the essence 
 Not the magazine, Maybeline Cold Cream Afro-Sheen tip 
 Comin' deep into the soul 'cause I mean it 
 Disciples of pop want to redeem it - nope 
 I don't know why, why is that 
 Why must I, chase the cat? 
 Nothin' but the dog, in me 
 Continue you just gonna, fall in the 
 Midst of a hip-hop blitz with a trip 
 Back to the batter to the Gladys of the Pi-dup 
 Watch me ri-dup, all 
 Type of TV screens movie type scenes 
 Just like blues, hip-hop paid dues 
 Dues can be recouped if you act souped 
 Makin' pop beats, so keep it street 
 (Chubb Rock) 
 Block party, nineteen-eighty-one 
 People havin' fun, no one with a gun 
 No ducats, you pay nothin' at the gate 
 You escape to the sounds of a Cold Crush tape 
 In your back pocket, rap is always clocked then 
 Jump on the Realistic mic then rock it 
 No clock don't stop until mother nature says 
 No conflict between usual knuckleheads 
 That didn't affect the morale of the crowd 
 Just those kids pumped the set up loud 
 Nowadays, our appearance is a big part of it 
 Everybody wants a Mr. T starter kit 
 Hip-Hop has always been you have a beef 
 With another man step to him, and throw ya hands 
 Come back and dance to the rhythm 
 Of a James Brown beat - and keep it street
