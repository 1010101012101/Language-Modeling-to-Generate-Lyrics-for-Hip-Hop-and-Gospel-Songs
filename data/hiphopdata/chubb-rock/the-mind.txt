"Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru {*repeat 3x*} 
 (Chubb rock) 
 I can taste your sex appeal, ready for the sweet sperm'n 
 Bank accounts all full, love interest be earnin 
 Ben franklins determine, if you get that higher learnin 
 The million man march, starrin' mark furhman (it can happen) 
 Lyrical don is the charm for the rappin' 
 Give spliff aromas cause many fetal comas 
 No blood donors, I credit diabetics who drink sodas 
 While in the pens lie the ruffneck soldiers, what happened? 
 Niggaz must have napped! 
 What happened to all of that malcolm x shit before he got trapped? 
 Before he got capped? when I mean capped, 
 When they put his name on all those cute little spike lee hats 
 And then they say "black is back" 
 For when, niggaz now only care about the rent 
 And how to pay rent, and how they trife squad spend 
 Black powder nose landcruise or range rove' 
 Why you runnin' for when you forerunnin nigga who drove 
 Your mind 
 "Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru 
 The mind! 
 "Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru 
 My mind! 
 "Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru 
 The mind! 
 "Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru 
 Yes, haha 
 From the inner sanctum, that embruised my medulla 
 You can praise buddha, or you can hail don shula 
 You can change a, religious title, or go praise gold idols 
 No sloth, just go read your bible 
 I'll insinuate the hate that made the, hate kids fight 
 Whether you're muslim, christian, or israelite 
 We monitor, who really praise hannukah 
 The power that I am will make you blow your yarmulke 
 To all ya, don't let me scream up, to call ya 
 My flatbush dushies, or the kids down in somal-ia 
 While we're up here tryin' to wiggle to "boombastic" 
 You get, hemmed up and cut down in +park jurassic+ 
 You're crazed, from that beer juice 
 Acute angles become, obtuse 
 Four white kids, was the first rock group - not! 
 Rabble rousing, in with the chime 
 Laced with the fat rhyme tunneled through my mind 
 "Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru 
 The mind! 
 "Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru 
 The mind! 
 "Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru 
 The mind! 
 "Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru 
 Ha ha 
 Now from the minds of minolta, from the nickel-plate poster 
 From the average jack wack crackheads with oprah 
 As with safe sex with rubbers, as with rappers turnin' mothers 
 As for tupac's on the covers, as for million march brothers 
 In ninety-six, while we pinpoint the "crooklyn" spike joint 
 Three kings of the break of dawn become vocal pawns 
 The circumfrence of the bedouins, or is it the thespians 
 For the past three years, I've been eatin more than lesbians 
 Lyricists, get fists, twists, careers become tears 
 Easy gold records, but with no, publishing shares 
 When I bellow, over a hardcore track with a cello 
 Lyrical structure, basting from a fellow, hello 
 Street nucks can't knuckle, billboard chart bullets be chuckle 
 A&r stars become bouregoises, but subtle 
 Why is it the master can't behave with the slave chime 
 Or is it over the domes of weak minds? 
 The mind 
 "Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru 
 The mind! 
 "Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru 
 The mind! 
 "Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru 
 My mind! 
 "Your nine spray, my mind spray" -> jeru 
 The mind! 
 My mind! 
 The mind... 
 My mind! ha ha! ah, ah! ah!
