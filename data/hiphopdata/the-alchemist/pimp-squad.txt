Verse 1 (T.I.) 
 Below da Mason-Dixon Line, hey, I'm da best you gon find... 
 Bottom line, I ain't humble, 'cause nigga its bout time... 
 Rather grind on da corner, hollin, I got dimes 
 Rather then know that I'm da best in dis shit and not shine. 
 Give a fuck 'bout a clique if it's not mine 
 Got rhymes, I'm da sign of da time, I'm not lying 
 Nigga plannin on robbin me blind, start tryin' 
 Got sumtin to but a end to 380's and glock nines 
 Shit you gotta shoot from ur shoulders, wont fit in holsters 
 Bid on ur life and force a forclosure... 
 I can rebuild S.W.A.T.'s all da yay dat I got... 
 I'm da king it don't matta if I say it or not 
 It don't matter if da old niggaz don't wanna say dat I'm hot... 
 It don't matter whether my first single was playin' or not 
 Nigga I stay right here, never go gold, shoot nine videos, and drop records every year... 
 All da fake niggaz, feel real niggaz'll break... 
 Young, skinny, wit plenty whores, puttin' niggaz to play... 
 Hey talk behind my back, u have me in ur face, wit da PSC in ur safe, while you pee in ur cage!
