Hey yo, knock knock, get your motherfucking doc and motherfucker chaos, motherfucker 
 You could bear witness 
 We got plans like the mobsters 
 Distribute drugs in pharmaceuticals, overdose usual 
 Look so beautiful, if you could see what in is all 
 If you could be so the system is loaded car system was roaded like pistols be loaded 
 Divisions exploded, most can't handle it doses they open the ER prom 
 The medicals treat marijuana incredible 
 Passion, some kind of ethical 
 Fucking everywhere, ecstasy, get you where you wanna go 
 Your hurt pumps faster the stereo, let it go 
 We heads, coke dealers, gorillas, 
 Takes drugs, take drugs, three times, blast makers 
 Killers, road withers, take drugs, take drugs 
 Too smack, too cold, don't do that I took dope, I blow smoke needle's up choke 
 Take a vein and inject opium directly into my brain 
 When I'm driving's not even considered a blame, she is 
 More twisted than your ankle when it's crippled it's brain 
 Enough of this pull up a hashish stick the size of a 
 Break up a slam and chop it quick 
 Bake cookies with no chopping chip 
 Without a package of baggage 
 I'm trying to make a control habit 
 Smoking this with matches, I stay high like a pussy on a giraffe it is 
 My back yard's a garden to cannabis batches 
 Smoking this stem with matches 
 Hold, is all right five seconds ago, 
 Man I'm high and shit 
 Take drugs, take drugs, take drugs, 
 We heads, coke dealers, gorillas, 
 Takes drugs, take drugs, three times, blast makers 
 Killers, road withers, take drugs, take drugs
