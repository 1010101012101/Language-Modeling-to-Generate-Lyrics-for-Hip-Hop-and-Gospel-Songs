Patty cake patty cake I'm baked my man 
 Kick it on your street like bad Chris and them garbage cans 
 Awww man, them bitches think I'm ballin 
 So they behaving differently when I be in New Orleans 
 I'm falling back off her, they crawling back on them 
 Not half way complaining just making a true statement 
 Which quite basically is was missing from this game we in 
 Create the world in which you trying to live in kid 
 Some of my friends passed away some of my homies doing bids 
 But best believe I take bring 'em with me anywhere I is 
 What a hater say will never affect the way I live 
 Or where I go, just make me fuck they bitches in they crib 
 The game I got was raw and given to him by slim 
 Referring to himself in the third when he on them herb 
 Make sure I don't park outside in the streets 
 But don't get too close to the curb 
 Jet life too high for them birds
