It be like queen's kid with the face like Jim the Anvil 
 Night hard, I play the part smoking night shot 
 My mind's sharp like a shape off from Dominicans 
 There's no confession when I'm sending fucking cinnamon 
 Women rocking, double colored, leaning in front of beginning 
 I see you lie, you use pretending, better watch who you be befriending 
 My shit is profound, I shoot the pistol with the whistle sound 
 And cast the show before I hit the ground 
 Then pill off just like the skin of the pepper 
 Order jacket that I'm packing 'cause I'm twisted in level 
 Don't get it twisted, keep the biscuit sour but shake its shadow 
 Getting fly just like the ship with the feathers 
 You could be laying face down if you sold shoes 
 Or leave you covered in a blanket man, you won't lose 
 I'm from a place where kids are shaking for some cold shoes 
 Hand out of pocket with a hakey on a bold trouce, it's me
