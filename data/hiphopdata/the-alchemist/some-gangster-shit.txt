Look's like your memory need refresh'n 
 You couldn't do me if you were doing an impression 
 Maybe I should just press charges for swagger deaf 
 You faggots' deaf if you can't hear, I'm hot as dragon's breathe 
 Nah I'm pass hot, I'm the sun's mascot 
 When snacks on deck I'm at your neck like an ass scot. 
 Its low so, she all ready knows so 
 I said ok good, tell that other ho so. 
 I say Wussup son, You wussup son 
 They say your swagger on viagra keep it up son 
 Ball'n is key, we start the engine with buttons 
 This player be limp'n call an injury sturtin
