(Prodigy) What's poppin' thun {*4X*} 
 (Over Prodigy) 
 {A-A-A-A-Al-Al-Al-Alchemist} 
 "You better check the files..." {*echoes*} 
 "Mixed with the A-L-C" 
 (Chorus: repeat "What's poppin' thun" start of each line) 
 ... Nuttin but that brand new shit 
 ... Nuttin but that cash on the bed 
 ... It's nuttin but that food, that bread 
 ... Nuttin but my gun on your head 
 (Prodigy) 
 Smoke game Cambodian, doly in the Benz 
 Turnin' up the sounds of 2006 
 This the future of rap, I'll give you a glimpse of this 
 So you can be ahead of the game and impress your friends 
 Bumpy Johnson and Dutch Schultz, we blowin' up hoods...

 This the future of rap, I'll give you a glimpse of this 
 So you can be ahead of the game, and impress your friends 
 Bumpy Johnson and Dutch Schultz, we blowin' up hoods 
 This is theme music my nig, you wake up to it 
 Get dressed, throw on your gun and Jacob to it 
 Ladies throw on they pumps and makeup to it 
 You can grill all you want... 
 But when that light turn green, I'ma go from 0 to 60 
 In like 3.9, my thun told me shine baby shine 
 So I get it like I'm out of my mind 
 Man I did that already, I'm ahead of my time 
 I'm on some new shit now, if it ain't money I ain't budgin 
 Cause my hammer do the buckin {*blam*} over dumb shit 
 I gotta move right niggaz want it with the kid 
 You can't touch me boy my roots is too thick 
 And run deep in the dirt, I'll give you the business 
 Well my crib say "Welcome" on the mat 
 So you can lay in the bushes, till your feet drenched 
 But you gon' have a hard time tryin' to find which one I'm in 
 And which state I'm in, P the fuckin' rocket man 
 Don't matter it's the hot shit, for that moment 
 P shit is timeless, he keep goin'
