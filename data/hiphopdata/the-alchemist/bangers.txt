(Lloyd banks talking) 
 Yeah! haha

 BANKS! (A A A A Alchemist) 
 G g g g g-unit! 
 (Chorus - Loyd Banks) 
 Now, don't try to stand next to me (right) 
 'Cause I'm the nigga that came here to see (right) 
 Ain't nufin' round here for free (right) 
 And I'm here to let these mothafuckas know 
 That ill do anythin' for the dough (right) 
 A felony walkin' out the front door (right) 
 Ain't a mothafucka I gotta change for (right) 
 Therefore imma be this way until I go. 
 (Loyd Banks) 
 Guess who walk around with dimond chains and rings on him 
 A pair of throw-back Jordans wit the wings on 'em 
 With all this talking, I'm guessin' they got them things on 'em 
 'Cause if not, milli's and .40 cal's will rain on them 
 I know your kind get in a bind and leave the city quick 
 Niggas bleed just like us, I'm on that Biggie shit 
 First of all, I'm suppose to ball, I'm suppose to have coast to coast to call 
 Even your niggas know your CD's garbage, yeah, they shottin but they missin' Sprayin up the wall like graffiti artists 
 Some niggas go and buy the bootlegs, but go and cop the real shit 
 Because the fans love us, nicer than grandmothas 
 I wake up, get dressed, put on my Tan Buttas 
 I been this way since Pumas and Superman covers 
 A ice-pick will do your liver harm 
 And have you screamin in the back of the club louder than Lil' Jon. 
 (Chorus - Loyd Banks) 
 Now, don't try to stand next to me (right) 
 'Cause I'm the nigga that came here to see (right) 
 Ain't nufin' round here for free (right) 
 And I'm here to let these mothafuckas know 
 That I'll do anythin' for the dough (right) 
 A felony walkin' out the front door (right) 
 Ain't a mothafucka I gotta change for (right) 
 Therefore imma be this way until I go. 
 (Loyd Banks) 
 Your now lookin' at the hood-meal ticket seven thou' on my wrist 
 It's kinda hard to keep the balance with this, it keeps the challengers pissed, I vacate the different islands and twist and back home where the violence exsists 
 Nines, silencers, 5th's 
 We buy mileage as gifts as well as man's best friend 
 And I don't own no Rottweillers or Pits 
 It's gettin' extremely hard, for the man to roam wit lil kids puttin' his picture on the camera phone, shit's changed now that the camera's on 
 A bitch will jepordize their marriage, to fuck you when they man is gone 
 These niggas rambleing on, 'bout the paper that they gettin', Stop It 
 I have more money than you in my lil pocket. 
 And I'm stingey, so it stretch long, with G-unit sweats on 
 Thread, needle to teflon, desert-eagle and vest on 
 Cause everybody ain't amused, that your names surrounded by good news 
 Fuck y'all! 
 (Chorus - Loyd Banks) 
 Now, don't try to stand next to me (right) 
 'Cause I'm the nigga that came here to see (right) 
 Ain't nufin' round here for free (right) 
 And I'm here to let these mothafuckas know 
 That I'll do anythin' for the dough (right) 
 A felony walkin' out the front door (right) 
 Ain't a mothafucka I gotta change for (right) 
 Therefore imma be this way until I go.
