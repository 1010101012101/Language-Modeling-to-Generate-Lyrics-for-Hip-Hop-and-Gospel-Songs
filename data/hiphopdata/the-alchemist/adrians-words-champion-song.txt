You didn't push him into anything 
 It was like rolling out and he did what he had to do 
 You ain't right if you're guilty for what happened, you don't 
 You're a champion and you did what you're expected to do 
 And you did what I and everyone else thought you should do 
 And you wanna tell me that those fights weren't real? 
 That you will carry, well, I don't believe you 
 It doesn't matter what I believe because you are the one 
 That's got to carry that fear around and inside you 
 Afraid that everybody's gonna take these days away 
 But I know that it's true, it doesn't matter if I do 
 It doesn't matter because you are the one that's gotta set with it 
 Get rid of it even if all this smoke is cleared 
 And everyone start shouting your name 
 It's just gonna be us, it's just gonna be us, it's just gonna be us
