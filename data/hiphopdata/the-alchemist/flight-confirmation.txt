I popped a E-pill and it taste like some oil sheen 
 Flow boiled Goya beans, gasoline in saline, red lining red beams 
 Fed timing round OGs who you ain't snitch, nigga 
 Everybody know you just snitch, nigga 
 Heart rate Adderall got me on some star-gate 
 Pacing, smoking lucys back to back 
 Car chase, monopolize 'bout to take your park place 
 Shark face, bite the style but these niggas second rate 
 I cannon bombed in the pool of fuckin' rap 
 And I splashed on these niggas, head first, no depth, nigga 
 That's why I'm black, nigga 'cause y'all whack, nigga 
 Met Alchemist '07 in Miami 
 Fifty K jewels on nigga, ask 'em about Danny 
 Now I'm on some bruiser, hair looking Yakuza 
 Jeans extra tight and ya bitch got a ruler 
 Shimmy, shimmy ya, shimmy, yeah, shimmy, you 
 I guess it's time to kill this shit, real as this, game fears 
 Put in work, determined, I been the fierce, me gettin' it up is limitless 
 Before I started eatin' pussy I was hittin' licks 
 Two elevens on bitch niggas, whipped in with antennas 
 Didn't your momma tell your ass not to hang with them gang members? 
 Didn't listen, head missin', flat-lined, he groove lined 
 Bad twins, they too fine, dummy stay on my mind 
 Most shots at [unverified] six is my gat drive 
 Click, click, reload mine, green light, no stop signs 
 Hey Danny, let's shoot these fuckin' Xanny's 
 And call that bitch from Kendrick's song, I bet it all we fuck on Tammy 
 Ask my pumper, hand prints all over her bumper 
 She love me long time, I'm forever that motherfucker 
 Smokin' keepin' my cool, black hippy, the new school, Q
