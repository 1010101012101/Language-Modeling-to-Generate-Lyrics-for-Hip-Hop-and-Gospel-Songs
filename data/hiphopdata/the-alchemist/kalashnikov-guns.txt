A demonstration of who the best is 
 Stress is when I afflict your death wish 
 Check this before I check you 
 And tell you what the rest knew already 
 We get it heavy, money bad 
 The crack or axe roll on your Chevy 
 Get ready, prepare for the truth 
 I double dare one to double cross me 
 Play booth, you can't flip to suit 
 You run them down, blindfold 'em 
 Line 'em up, gun them down 
 Even when I fuck around I don't fuck around 
 My life work can leave your life curb 
 Smell a perfect trait, yeah, I smell like perp 
 Dirt, do your dirty and give it back to earth 
 For what is worth find another turf 
 Before you work learn the hustle first 
 Cut them off with a hunger thirst 
 I drink in here till I'm full, the raging bull 
 Too much births and yeah, I'm full 
 Aiming at the chess play, call it lay it face 
 You get cramps when the Brea Brakes 
 I get big chunks, raw chunks 
 You'll get found in the deep slump 
 You ran it out of throw, real face 
 I pump your brakes, see you at the wait, nigger
