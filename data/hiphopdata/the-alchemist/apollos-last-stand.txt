Bad boy fighting in the last round, hard glove 
 Sudden death over time, shit, no coming back 
 'Cause sniffing on the powder does eyes wide 
 Make sure your shoe's tight, you run from the Ripper in a homicide 
 Street's disciple, legendary knight shit 
 Chop all them, move quick, how about the cock pit? 
 Snakes on a plane, hold guns, they own some cop shit 
 Too late, that my friend's son is obnoxious 
 Respect taking if niggers don't wanna give it 
 I close my ears to stories if you ain't living 
 Half these niggers in the game catch them, fliches up and not with you 
 Halfway turds if we address them, no 
 The weak shell perish, I'm walking the most a realness 
 I wrote this shit straight from the heart so you should feel this 
 Lie detectors are more recurrent reveal this 
 Who's the father? Many of us bust it off 
 Hot dogs in the face, she wipe the mustard off 
 L A S for the level, this shit is for the soul 
 Dominate the stadium quick because she loved the boss 
 I'm an out-door speech giver, the podium killer 
 Nobody real here but God and that's my nigger 
 I woke with angels and toast with demons 
 Two sized to the Gemini mind for different reasons 
 I was born in the middle of nature, switching seasons 
 Bansoon to the moon, you're chilling with Jaggy Gleasy
