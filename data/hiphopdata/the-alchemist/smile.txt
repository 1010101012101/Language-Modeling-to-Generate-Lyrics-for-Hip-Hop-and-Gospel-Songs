I hide my tears from the crowd by smiling 
 By smiling 
 I'm even smiling for me 
 Smiling so you know why you can't hurt me 
 Smiling for something, not hiding from falling 
 Now what you know about what smiles are all about 
 Gotta keep moving the weight 
 Winter, summer, spring to the fall 
 Gotta keep food on my plate 
 Gotta keep plaques on the wall 
 Gotta keep proving I'm great 
 I'm so sick of it all 
 Gotta keep smile on my face 
 Even if I slip and I fall 
 Gotta have mask for the pain 
 If you want to master the game 
 I was only after the props 
 Really I was never after the fame 
 I was never after the Range 
 Now I'm like a rat in a race 
 Always tryna catch up the chase 
 Feeling like I'm trapped in the maze 
 Never let 'em see me when I'm down 
 Never let 'em see me with a frown 
 Even when the game beat me to the ground 
 I get up and go another round 
 Lock it up and show another town 
 Break it up and roll another pound 
 Change it up and go another route 
 Flip and make a whole another sound 
 Like the way I did on hold it down 
 Yeah, you know the kid'll hold it down 
 Never knew the name, you know it now 
 Never knew the face, you know it now 
 Look at all this cake I'm holding now 
 Thinking of a way to throw it now 
 Fuck it, everyday I blow it now 
 Gotta get it where I know it now 
 I'm even smiling for me 
 Smiling so you know why you can't hurt me 
 Smiling for something, not hiding from falling 
 Now what you know about what smiles are all about 
 I'm even smiling for me 
 Smiling so you know why you can't hurt me 
 Smiling for something, not hiding from falling 
 Now what you know about what smiles are all about 
 Gotta get it how you gotta get it 
 That's what's up to family, I'm that committed 
 The only way that we can all get the cake 
 Is if we get up, how we got to split it 
 If you got a verse, you better spit it 
 If you see a job, you better get it 
 And if you can hoop, stay on yo' pivot 
 'Cause the truth is this is life you gotta live it 
 Try not to travel down the wrong road 
 So that when your legacy is told 
 You was known to be a hustler who provided 
 For his family and did it cold 
 Conquer obstacles and challenges 
 Make your competition bow to this 
 Spit it for my homey Alchemist 
 Hold up, let me find another style for this 
 Come with the energy, making me wanna erupt 
 Sipping a little of Remy up out of my cup 
 Come with the lyrical, kush I'm taking a puff 
 Alchemist, come with the rhythm and I'm a be fucking it up 
 Rap ain't another comparable, gonna be doing 
 The shit I be doing, I'm killing 'em, breaking 'em off of the gwap 
 I got the remedy that'll be filling my pocket with papers 
 And I'm a be telling the haters I don't stop 
 Until I'm on top of the world, I stay focused 
 Until I'm gone, no one be ferocious 
 Make your body move like law 
 Make the cane move like Moses 
 Make the waters move like a shark 
 Trees move like a summer breeze 
 Smile in your face tell you to grind hard 
 'Til you get you one of these 
 I'm even smiling for me 
 Smiling so you know why you can't hurt me 
 Smiling for something, not hiding from falling 
 Now what you know about what smiles are all about 
 I'm even smiling for me 
 Smiling so you know why you can't hurt me 
 Smiling for something, not hiding from falling 
 Now what you know about what smiles are all about 
 I'm even smiling for me 
 Smiling so you know why you can't hurt me 
 Smiling for something, not hiding from falling 
 Now what you know about what smiles are all about 
 I hide my tears from the crowd by smiling 
 I go out and spend my money 
 So they can see smiling
