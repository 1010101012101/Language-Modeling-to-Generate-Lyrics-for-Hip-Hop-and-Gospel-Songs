This is dedicated to you, the half way crook 
 Poking bitches on Facebook 
 The same lane with the chains took 
 I throw flames, let this frame cook 
 Black bags and black matches the season 
 Motherfucker, I don't get mad, I get even 
 Burning the devils, let us self regard and then eaten 
 Yeah, 20 people in the park, part of my heaven 
 We're all here, grisly gang, playing your part better 
 I support the rights of arm bear, yeah 
 Long stares, I lift you off the lawn chairs 
 Nigger, better keep it calm when the dawn's near 
 This is cloud rapper for low pack 
 The nigger fell ass, little wow patch 
 A game have it, chain snatching 
 Crown figures, my niggers 
 Fuck it with all this stuff 
 Half is getting splashed like a lottery ticket 
 I'm stuck in my mission, my nigger 
 This is dedicated to you, the half way crook 
 Poking bitches on Facebook 
 The same lane with the chains took 
 It's only logic that I got to be the motherfucker, man 
 If you can empathize with me then you would understand 
 That I'm an over achiever, a born leader 
 I would thought to never ever leave the house without the heater 
 And fuck a delly departed 
 It had a couple leaders while I'm seeking the ceiling 
 Niggers say that I graduated for steaming 
 Well, maybe not, still California dreaming 
 The parking lot's full of 'em police and grimace 
 A couple got spit the swallowing my semen 
 Shoe box full of dollars for no reason 
 I'm a problem, best believe it 
 Vomit like I'm bulimic, over substance supersonic 
 Kind of I'm with the seizures, ironic, my competition 
 I watch it, Joyce, keep it good and kind 
 This fast life is Russian Roulette 
 Only waiting when if you do it to death
