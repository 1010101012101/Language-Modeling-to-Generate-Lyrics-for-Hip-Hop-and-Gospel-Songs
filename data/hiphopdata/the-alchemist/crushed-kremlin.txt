Stacking peppels for X pull of leathers 
 Back burn bitches raffle feathers, let 'em get us 
 He ain't one in many way, that's the game playing 
 Switch them up and bust some eldy, that's my main man 
 Move figurous, sharp smooth scissor is 
 Sipping on the V side up, smooth privilege 
 Q new nellience, see-through fake images 
 I do this swinging shit, my progress' limitless 
 Incinerate dreams just by living 
 That's the motherfucking trophy, everyday is Thanks Giving 
 Skunks drifting quite often in my rhyme 
 Got a good girl on my hood, keep the bad ones on the side 
 Stuck in my ways, hustling for days 
 Don't give a fuck about the world that's stock shocking grenades 
 I've got bags under my eyes keep 'em tucked under shades 
 Those shames of brand names keep in stuck in the days, so it's my way
