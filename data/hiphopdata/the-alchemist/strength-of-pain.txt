(So much has changed..) 
 (So much has changed..) 
 When I was younger 
 I thought my life would be easy 
 Always had my parents to guide me 
 From the cold world, 
 They could not make me see 
 I had no worries 
 Anything I wanted was there for me 
 My friends wishing they could be like me 
 With the diamond rings and the baby Gucci 
 I'm thinking of the good old days 
 When all of my life was funny games 
 And all I had to do was think of me, 
 No stress, no responsebilities 
 I won't cry any longer 
 All of my pain make me stronger 
 I'll do the best to maintain that happiness that I remember 
 x2 
 Why d'you leave me, 
 Tell me why you left me 
 Innocence has a child so easy 
 Why d'you leave, 
 Tell me why you left me 
 Daddy why d'you leave me? 
 Daddy why d'you leave me? 
 Life as a teenager 
 Started moving oh, so rapidly 
 Took my mom and my pops away from me 
 God was rolling, and I could not see 
 Why 
 They had to leave me 
 Who would have thought that this could be 
 My life was turning unbeliveably 
 This could not be happening to me 
 I'm thinking of the good old days 
 When all of my life was funny games 
 And all I had to do was think of me, 
 No stress, no responsebilities 
 I won't cry any longer 
 All of my pain make me stronger 
 I'll do the best to maintain that happiness that I remember 
 Now I'm a young lady 
 And didn't want nobody to think for me 
 Went against my family 
 And was a baby, having my own baby 
 How real is that, can ya feel me? 
 Didn't need no help from nobody, 
 Not even no help from yo daddy 
 I, myself, and my own Lady 
 x2 
 Why d'you leave me, 
 Tell me why you left me 
 Innocence has a child so easy 
 Why d'you leave, 
 Tell me why you left me 
 Daddy why d'you leave me? 
 Daddy why d'you leave me? 
 I know ways, they can't remain 
 No matter how fucking hard it may be 
 I'm gonna walk with my head up to the sky 
 This life is like an alternate eye
