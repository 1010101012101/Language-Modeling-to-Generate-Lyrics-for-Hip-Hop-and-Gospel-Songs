(Twin Gambino) 
 Yeah, Yo 
 I grew up in the projects of QBC 
 (Alchemist) 
 I grew up in the lap of luxury where chickens love for me 
 I used to watch 
 Sesame Street 
 (Twin) 
 I used to watch the D's play in the street 
 Plus I couldn't wait to squeeze my first heat 
 (Alchemist) 
 I used to pray to God before I went to sleep every night 
 (Twin) 
 Same time I was kissing the dice, hitting my number twice 
 Holding hammers with the heat out with nice 
 (Alchemist) 
 Same time I was popping cap guns on BMX bikes 
 With grass stains on my jeans and scuffed up Nike's 
 (Twin) 
 I was like fuck school, I ain't going to class 
 Easy money in the street, I was rollin' with that 
 Never good at math but I knew how to add up cash 
 (Alchemist) 
 I used to win the spelling bees 
 My education was proper, my family wanted me to be a lawyer a doctor 
 I was smooth talker (back in those days) I was a moon walker 
 With a picture of my shorty inside of my school locker 
 (Twin and Alchemist) 
 (T) I never had shit 
 (A) I always had it all 
 (T) We used to play with guns 
 (A) We used to play ball 
 (T) I used to pump crack 
 (A) In school I paid attention 
 (T) I was a hard head 
 (A) I always used to listen 
 (T) We turned bitches out 
 (A) I used to love hoes 
 (T) We wore hammy downs 
 (A) I always had new clothes 
 (T) I used to stay bent 
 (A) I couldn't hold my liquor 
 (T) It's kind of bugged out 
 (A) Two different stories in one picture 
 (Alchemist) 
 Yo 
 The first year of high school my parents noticed me slipping 
 Smoking cigarettes skipping class catching detention 
 (Twin) 
 Every night all I heard was freeze 
 Niggaz getting bagged by the D's 
 And some bitch that got a disease 
 (Alchemist) 
 Fourteen and watching Yo MTV Raps on 40 inch screens 
 I learned how to tilt my hat sag my jeans 
 Wanted a Nefertiti piece thought that would be fresh 
 (Twin) 
 Me and my brother used to yank those shits straight off people's necks 
 Summer time river park man's at 1 2 fifth 
 Sticking kids with my identical twin 
 If I could go back in time I would take you with me 
 Show you what it's like to live a lifestyle to risky 
 (Alchemist) 
 I put in work in rhymes and beats while you was putting work in the streets 
 It's bugged out who ever would have thought that we'd meet 
 But it's this rap shit that made this package complete 
 They put us into the studio and put these raps to this beat 
 (Alchemist) 
 I'm west coast, Imma rep it forever 
 But I had to move to the east to get all of my respect and my cheddar 
 To tell the truth, the only thing I really left was the weather 
 All of my friends the same we always kept it together 
 (Twin) 
 Picture this: "Shook Ones" dropped, the Mobb on top 
 Now rolling state to state with shows nonstop 
 Seen the money Hav and P was getting off in the top 
 Off of hip hop I wasn't going back to the black 
 (Alchemist) 
 My man Muggs introduced me to you Nitty and G.O.D 
 Brought me to the studio to play music to Hav and P 
 (Twin) 
 You can't forget my dunns Noyd and Gotti 
 (Alchemist) 
 I was a nobody 
 They showed me love told me they got me 
 (Twin) 
 Remember the first time I the bong, I was doing it wrong 
 Took us some months till my high was gone 
 They we showed you how to roll up dutchies then it was on 
 (Alchemist) 
 Now we rollin' all across the country with hit songs
