I've seen a lot of things in life that words can't explain 
 See we ain't any different but we just ain't the same 
 They never listen when we tell 'em, tell 'em 
 All they understand is venom, venom 
 People only use you when you let 'em, let 'em 
 Well, if that's the case then I'm the one to blame 
 'Cause there's a man overboard and the tide's gonna drag him down 
 If there's a man in the clouds, tell me, where the hell is he now 
 Why is the silence so loud, have I thrown it all away 
 Lemme know, lemme know tell me is that what happens 
 For having a good intention, -tention, oh 
 And look what happened to my good intention, -tention, oh 
 Why won't anybody answer my question, why is the silence so loud 
 I think I've thrown it all away 
 I don't know, I don't know but lemme know 
 Hear me out before you label me the bad one 
 I'm walking through the desert but I'm drowning inside 
 No river runs deeper than the tear from my eye 
 You only make 'em get even bitter, bitter 
 I wish I wasn't such a giver, giver 
 I apologize to my liver, liver 
 'Cause if that's the case then you're the one to blame 
 'Cause there's a man overboard and the tide's gonna drag him down 
 If there's a man in the clouds, tell me, where the hell is he now 
 Why is the silence so loud, have I thrown it all away 
 Lemme know, lemme know tell me is that what happens 
 For having a good intention, -tention, oh 
 And look what happened to my good intention, -tention, oh 
 Why won't anybody answer my question, why is the silence so loud 
 I think I've thrown it all away 
 I don't know, I don't know but lemme know 
 Hear me out before you label me the bad one 
 Am I wrong to think the worlds got it in for me 
 And am I right to say 
 I'm longing for some sympathy 
 See I feel a sound but I can't hear it 
 That's my heart strings getting played like a symphony 
 Yo, you know you turned me insane 
 Why you staring out the window when I'm the one with the pain 
 You know you set me off the rails 
 And you'll be to blame if you're ever here 
 I dropped in front of the train we're both fucked in the brain 
 'Cause there's a man overboard and the tide's gonna drag him down 
 If there's a man in the clouds, tell me, where the hell is he now 
 Why is the silence so loud, have I thrown it all away 
 Lemme know, lemme know tell me is that what happens 
 For having a good intention, -tention, oh 
 And look what happened to my good intention, -tention, oh 
 Why won't anybody answer my question, why is the silence so loud 
 I think I've thrown it all away 
 I don't know, I don't know but lemme know 
 Hear me out before you label me the bad one 
 Why is the silence so loud 
 I think I've thrown it all away 
 I don't know, I don't know but lemme know 
 Hear me out before you label me the bad one
