Somebody better ring 999 if they wanna get rid of me 
 Call the coastguard, bring the military 
 I never came to pose for no photo 
 I ain't a statue, don't take liberties 
 Exclusive imports from Italy 
 I got swagger that's sharp like a guillotine 
 I see a couple good girls that are feeling me 
 But only bad girls get into my Billie Jeans 
 They be loving me because I give them what they ask for 
 Follow me, they let me out the hard door 
 I hear gossip 'cause I'm in the heat 
 Anything that I'm packin' needs its own passport 
 I thought he was a spaceman, am only playing fam 
 I'm looking at short skirts, Raybans 
 How's you night gone, you got a light hun 
 Is that your man? He's a right blag 
 Somebody's coming home with me tonight 
 High heels, fake tans 
 We go stumbling down the stairs 
 I'm wavey, hold me up 
 How's your night? 'Cause you got a light blud 
 So is that your girl, she mite still 
 Somebody is coming home with me tonight 
 I mite do something I regret tonight, I don't care 
 'Cause when I wake up I-I-I I won't remember 
 I won't remember a thing 
 If only you could stay like this for ever 
 Then I'll be living the dream, dream dream 
 (You're comin' with me) 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay 
 It feels like the night couldn't get any better 
 Feel like any girl I want, I can get her 
 I'm getting hot, I might take of my top 
 But I'll still make it rain, better get an umbrella 
 What ella ella, forget about your fella 
 Got a table full of great goose and don't please 
 Put your purse back in ya bag, tonight's on me 
 Never know tomorrow, you could be on page 3 
 Fall to the floor, feeling bad like a jagerbomb 
 No jet-ski can ride this wave I'm on 
 Who knows if I wave my wand 
 I might turn your girl into a baby mum 
 So don't you wish your boyfriend had a, uh, like me 
 I'm looking at short skirts, Raybans 
 High heels, fake tans, we go stumbling down the stairs 
 Am wavey, hold me up 
 How's ya night gone? You got a light hun 
 Is that man he's a right blank 
 Somebodies comin' home with me tonight 
 I might do something I regret but I don't care 
 'Cause when I wake up I won't remember 
 Remember a thing 
 If only you could stay like this forever 
 Then I'll be living the dream, dream, dream 
 (You're comin' with me) 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay 
 I don't care 'cause when I wake up 
 I won't remember, remember a thing 
 If only like you could stay like this forever 
 Then I'll be living a dream, dream, dream 
 (You're comin' with me) 
 Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
