They wanna see a lot of me 
 So I hate when I talk to my boy from Penn 
 And he acts like, 'cause, you've forgotten me 
 I ain't got time to shit, let alone come check you blood 
 You know I'm hot property, I got property 
 Right now I'm in Europe 
 Fuckin' up shit more than the economy 
 So when you land you know I got you properly 
 I bring my people through with everythin' I do 
 You reckon me, I fuck with you, ah, ah, ah 
 If you a snitchin' little bitch and you love singin' to the blues 
 What if this song wasn't made for you 
 I'm comin', I'm comin' for you, ah, ah, ah 
 I'm comin', I'm comin' for you 
 Fuck so good, make a bitch wanna fight me 
 Wanna Rolex ring, Wiley, when I was a bum 
 Nobody really liked me, now it's time 
 For someone to go get a new job for Tinie 
 I'm only playin', I'm just sayin' I'ma shit 
 So hard, I'm constipated, overworked, underrated 
 Now my thing poppin' off, no gun relation 
 On my grind everyday, no roller bladin' 
 All eyes on moi, holla, baby, no love for the X 
 On that note, T tell Kelly, I got that motivation 
 Look, I beg someone, try find Max online, let her know 
 I wanna smash her from the back 
 If not Sarah Jane can come give me brain 
 And put them big red lips on my sack 
 Aw, I been killin' it 'cause I've been gettin' bread 
 Hard though, number 1s all day on a chart show 
 So fuck you and your 90 track mix-tape 
 That's a million bars of arsehole 
 My flows are wrecked and it opens legs 
 It's flyer than a motherfuckin' Jumbo Jet 
 What a selfish bastard, no respect 
 You know, Dapps, no regrets 
 I still roll through my hood and wear my chain 
 Fuck a top boy Scorcher and Bashy can't do the same 
 Real recognized, real 
 How many albums have you sold to date 
 I ain't sayin' I'm Wayne Or Kanye 
 But I'm livin' life on a runway 
 If you 9, I'd be like, welcome on board 
 My brother say bye to the gun plain 
 I'm king of the jungle, hard as can be 
 I dare you let your chick party with me 
 I'm Tarzan and I'm hung like a tree 
 Imagine if your newborn 
 Pops out lookin' exactly like moi 
 'Cause I'm on the tour bus gettin' pampered 
 I heard Simon Cowell thinks I'm a lil' wanker 
 And I'm gettin' on his tits like cancer 
 And I don't wanna start mentionin' names 
 Fuck it, where they all now they're bankrupt 
 Joe Mac Eldry, aw, what a stand up, Alexandra, pull your socks up 
 Where your hits, you ain't no winner 
 I feel bad 'cause your voice is amazin' 
 But your career is gettin' raped by a mason 
 That shit fuckin' upsets me 'cause they don't get me 
 Try bring them near me, comin' around 
 With their hands out, askin' for a handout 
 Aw, that's too political 
 I don't care about a Bentley, Gucci or Fentley 
 Man's livin' in a spaceship, you got clapped by 
 Bang, your girl got magged 
 Bang, by that smooth criminal 
 I'm a product of my environment 
 I ain't sayin' me and you are any different 
 I'm just plannin' an early retirement 
 I don't mind sorry if I sound like Kingston 
 Every man's welcome to fly long distance 
 We be on a beach with weed man 
 Winston? Winston? 
 Psst, I'm the craziest thing out of the United Kingdom 
 I bring my people through anythin' I do 
 You reckon me, I fuck with you, ah, ah 
 If you a snitchin' little bitch and you love singin' to the blues 
 What if this song wasn't made for you, ah, ah, ah 
 I'm comin', I'm comin' for you, ah, ah, ah 
 I'm comin', I'm comin' for you
