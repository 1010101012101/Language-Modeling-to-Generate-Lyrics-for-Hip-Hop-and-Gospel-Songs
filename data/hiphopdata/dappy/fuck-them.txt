So now you wanna know, 
 But where was you when I was broke? 
 Now I see love you've never shown, 
 So why you think I'm bading? 
 I almost swear I made it. 
 So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me, 
 Who's be coming at the ill? 
 Fuck them, I'm a disease. 
 I put my money where my mouth is, 
 They be lying through their teeth, 
 Our window be mistaken, I still ache like a pagan. 
 So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me, 
 I don't raise the bar so high, no satellite can find me, 
 They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out the sleeve 
 Gets pissed that they faded, my name they been cremated. 
 Lies. You've been guessing out them hoes, which are bullshit, 
 'Cause you've been kissing on your balls with your small dick. 
 Look, I got my willy up. 
 And the camera's on, but now you call me wrong on life, that's why Harry's on. 
 Door signs and a proof big, two times my hun' 
 I ain't shutting off my time, I'm just letting my shit hang on light 
 Off the size of red cage I saw nine in like drizzy 
 This time I'd be on the game like Chris Brizzi did to Ree-Ree. 
 That's just D A to P P Y, I'm doing me G 
 Them ring tone rappers ain't got no credit, if one rings around, that brings one later. 
 Peace cake, soft and sweet, I'll piss on them, they all tie their seats 
 I shit on them, mighty freaks, they'll never catch me on the sun bath. 
 'Cause no one cares about what the fuck was made in Chelsea, 
 The only way is the streets, don't care what no one tells me, 
 Skied off, once in, two shots, none left. Ten men, one pet. Ten times there? 
 Pussy roll on my carpet, 'cause the king of the jungle just tore that piece out the market, 
 They talking shit on the record, then why exhaust? 
 Doing us the dirty thing, is time to flush, 'cause the fucking thing's on it. 
 You solve it, you finish all, you dickheads be quiet, 
 I'm starving my face and I'm taking pussy, you on a diet. 
 You the type to go to Gucci? They caught up high just to try it, 
 They got picture, post it on Twitter and don't even buy 
 You don't hustle, you just listen to nipsy, 
 The only strap you only see is on the top of your kick 
 I go jump once before and you can even nor stinchy, 
 I got them on my shit back, and it wasn't my fish, 
 You see my chains link to my pride if you take what comes to my life 
 We get our sign, not even my toilet will let shit slide 
 Now let that book in mine and bring that pair around with that dick 
 If you only see the shape of that clip, suck it, I'm your prick. 
 So now you wanna know, 
 But where was you when I was broke? 
 Now I see love you've never shown, 
 So why you think I'm bading? 
 I almost swear I made it. 
 So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me, 
 Who's be coming at the ill? 
 Fuck them, I'm a disease. 
 I put my money where my mouth is, 
 They be lying through their teeth, 
 Our window be mistaken, I still ache like a pagan.

 They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out the sleeve 
 Gets pissed that they faded, my name they been cremated.
