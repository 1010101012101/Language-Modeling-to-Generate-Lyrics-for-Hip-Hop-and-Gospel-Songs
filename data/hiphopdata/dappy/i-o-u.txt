I owe you, but how come its took me this too long to say it 
 'Cause I have been hiding the truth 
 Didn't think I'd let you in on this shit. 
 But you know I wouldn't be here 
 If it wasn't for you, you see I've tried this on my own, 
 I owe you, imagine if I never got to see you again. 
 I'm gonna bite my tongue next time that you're speaking, 
 'Cause you deserve the time a day. 
 I abused your kindness with my weakness and threw it in your face. 
 Way to go, way to go, what a joke, I'm a joke, 
 If only you could see how I feel. 
 You bite your tongue next time that I'm screaming, 
 See, I ain't angry with you. 
 There's no escaping what I've done, 
 I hope you hear these words, 
 Lord, strike me down if any one of them's untrue. 
 You are the reason I am what I've become, I owe you. 
 Even though you don't want nothing, I owe you one. 
 Hand on heart, I don't think there's any other way to say this. 
 I admit being a prick didn't do me any favors, 
 I mean, I've been called every name under the sun's in my eyes, 
 But it feels pitch black inside, 
 I swear I put you through so much, now I couldn't lie to you if I tried 
 I admit acting a fool didn't do me any favors, 
 Imagine if I never got to see you again. 
 I bite my tongue next time that you're speaking, 
 'Cause you deserve the time a day. 
 I abuse your kindness with my weakness, 
 And threw it in your face. 
 Way to go, way to go, what a joke, I'm a joke, 
 If only you could see how I feel. 
 You bite your tongue next time that I'm screaming, 
 See, I ain't angry with you. 
 There's no escaping what I've done, 
 I hope you hear these words, 
 Lord, strike me down if any one of them's untrue. 
 See, you are the reason I am what I've become, I owe you. 
 Even though you don't want nothing, I owe you one. 
 Just be with me, let me speak to me, 
 I'm so sorry if I've drained you out. 
 That's why I love you, 
 And I hope you're glad you made me finally see it 
 That I'm nothing without you 
 Just tell me, imma see you again? 
 I swear I'll bite my tongue next time that you're speaking, 
 'Cause you deserve the time a day. 
 I abuse your kindness with my weakness, 
 And threw it in your face. 
 Way to go, way to go, what a joke, I'm a joke, 
 If only you could see how I feel. 
 You bite your tongue next time that I'm screaming, 
 See, I ain't angry with you. 
 There's no escaping what I've done, 
 I hope you hear these words, 
 Lord, strike me down if any one of them's untrue. 
 'Cause you are the reason I am what I've become, I owe you. 
 Even though you owe me nothing, I owe you one. 
 But you owe me nothing, 'cause I owe you one.
