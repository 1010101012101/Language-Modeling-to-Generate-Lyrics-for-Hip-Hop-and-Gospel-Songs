Past the point of humbling, I 
 I know I won't be anything 
 Once I'm strewn into my fate 
 There won't be any space to hate 
 With all the things we think about and, 
 All the things we live without 
 There's no time to procrastinate 
 And no time to collaborate 
 It wasn't too hard to find 
 Opportunities left behind 
 It was next to the jar 
 Of wishes to be placed on a shooting star 
 Hope is like a snickers bar 
 It's good, but it won't get you far 
 Source of short term energy 
 But soon becomes a memory 
 I'm living off of what I've got 
 I'd give it all for just one shot 
 To make something of myself someday 
 Collect my pride and move away
