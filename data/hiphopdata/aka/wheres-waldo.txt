Where's Waldo, can't you see that red and white shirt? 
 Is this just being friendly, 
 Or cruel attempts to flirt? 
 I think you want me 
 But then you don't... 
 Don't leave me feelin' filthy, wretched, I won't 
 Quench your pent up hunger 
 Relax the burning thirst 
 To know you know I don't know that would be the worst 
 Where's Waldo can you feel him deep inside? 
 Where's Waldo there's nowhere left for him to hide 
 Where's Waldo the man comes out so cruelly 
 Where's Waldo now I can be truly alive 
 Where's Waldo, can't you see that bulging turtleneck? 
 I'd be happy just to be a fraction of speck 
 The song they call it your life 
 Its meanings can disperse 
 You are for sure my pain is my verse! 
 *Drum solos followed by chorus* 
 Where are you? 
 Where are you? 
 Where are you? 
 Where are you? 
 Where are you? 
 (Son of a bitch...)
