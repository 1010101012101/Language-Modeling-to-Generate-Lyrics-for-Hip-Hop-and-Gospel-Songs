Never Felt like this, 
 Felt so insecure. 
 Felt this sly corruption 
 Attack the only thing that's pure 
 Attack the only thing that matters, 
 Attack the only thing I love. 
 At one time I was so confident, 
 Now I don't feel I'm enough. 
 Thought I'd carry her in my arms forever 
 But I fell... 
 Sometimes I don't feel I'm enough 
 (Sometimes I don't feel I'm enough) 
 Sometimes it feels like you're fed up, fed up... 
 Sometimes I don't feel like I'm enough 
 But I'd never let go 
 'Cause I'd never get enough 
 Now being weak is not an option 
 And sometimes you break the rules 
 But I'd do anything to prove 
 True love is not for fools 
 Now everything's against us 
 And nothing is familiar 
 And no one could care any less 
 And your next phone call seems so far 
 She's out looking for herself 
 And I'm looking for her as well 
 Thought I'd carry her in my arms forever 
 But I fell... 
 You know the necklace you gave me, with the charm I love? 
 The night that this all started, it broke, but I tied it off. 
 The night this turned serious, it broke once more. 
 I didn't save the beads, I'm sorry, they ran all over the floor. 
 But I saved the charm, yeah the charm is all I'll need. 
 We'll always have the charm, we can always buy more beads. 
 You've charmed me with love, other things strung us together, as long as we have the charm, we can always make things better. 
 So he woke you with a kiss... 
 So one more night of lonliness... 
 But I appreciate that you don't pretend 
 'Cause you know I'd walk through this fire 
 Again and again...
