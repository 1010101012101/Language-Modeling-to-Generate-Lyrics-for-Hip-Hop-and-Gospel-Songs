Society has taught me, 
 To be a level 6 personality. 
 It's told me it's been manifested, 
 By those without empathy. 
 The root of all that's evil, 
 And are morals are at standstill, 
 Is we don't understand each other, 
 And viewing pain gives us a thrill. 
 (Chorus) Crawl around inside his skin, maybe you'll see why you're under his skin. 
 Looking at not looking in, 
 Maybe that's why you never win. 
 The golden rule, if nothing else, 
 Keeps you satisfied with yourself. 
 And self satisfaction in turn will lead, 
 To destruction of immoral urges we feed. 
 Unempathizing, uncompromising, 
 Your stubborn ethics got you were you are. 
 That's why you're so lonely you pessimist, 
 That's why we've only come this far. 
 Try to see things my way, 
 And I'll try to see them yours, 
 Or we'll have to turn away. 
 This elevator's stuck on the basement floor.
