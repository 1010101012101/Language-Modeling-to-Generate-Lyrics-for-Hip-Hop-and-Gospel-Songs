Try to forgive, 
 Try to forget, 
 But I haven't found, 
 My answers yet, 
 Try to proceed 
 Optimistically, 
 But optimism fades into everything that keeps reminding me. 
 The sights the smells, 
 Once held dearly, 
 Now hold me to, my misery. 
 Try to escape, 
 This betrayal, 
 Try to break free, but every time, every time I fail. 
 Try to understand, and empathize, 
 But I need only, look in your eyes. 
 To bring back all the pain inside, 
 And let back out all the tears, 
 Tears I try and hide. (chah...) 
 I know I should look ahead, but it's always the two of you instead. 
 Try to look tomorrow, tomorrow in the face, 
 But it seems tomorrow has left, 
 Without a trace!
