You got your chips and dip 
 Tacos and sour cream 
 A can-o-pop to sip 
 Watch TV on big screen 
 Your whole house smells like ass 
 There's something wrong with you! 
 There's a question I must ask 
 All I wanna know is do ya... 
 Got milk? 
 Power to help me play! 
 Got milk? 
 Oh that would make my day! 
 Got milk? 
 To make my bones grow strong 
 Got milk? 
 To make my wang grow long! 
 We're young and thirsty, and we want some milk 
 (2x chorus)
