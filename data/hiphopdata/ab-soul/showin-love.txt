For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love 
 Pants still saggin' to the floor 
 Saggin' through your turf like I own this fuckin' earth 
 That's on my fuckin' life, I'm just livin' fuckin' life 
 This ain't House Party 5 but what's poppin' for tonight 
 I got a 'lil more dough to spend 
 Let's rest in peace up on the LB like Nate did 
 Y'all ain't smokin' y'all jokin' 
 Nugs big as Chuckie Cheese tokens and I'm tokin' 
 Bum house on Skid Row ain't this potent 
 Holy shit, I'm God-Sent, admire my skit 
 Cállate la boca in the presence of the most high (power) 
 Most high (power), Most high (power) 
 Yeah you heard me right 
 True achiever, new Adidas still tryna earn my stripes 
 For all my niggas doin' drugs 
 Fuckin' hoes and showin love 
 Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit 
 It's easy to assume we doin' decent, true indeed 
 I'm not from here, I'm of Heaven descent 
 And you'd agree, as sure as one and two is three 
 You'd have this music down to a tee if you was me 
 It's 36 O's in a key 
 It's only one in Ab-Soul, still open doors 
 Don't forget the dash, I might leave you with a gash 
 I ain't doin' no more shows unless I'm gettin' cash 
 Phillies full of hash, city on my back nigga 
 Fucked around and put Del Amo on the map 
 Carson, Californication no travel agent 
 But every day's a vacation and mothafuckas hate it 
 I flew in, but I ain't complanin' 
 And everyday I'm rainin' got the most precipitation 
 Soulo, Top Dawg Administration 
 Top Notch, Crock Pot Hot, where's your apron 
 Stop, watch, grab a stop watch, apply patience 
 And watch us pop across the population 
 Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run this shit 
 Go and tell 'em Soul told em, lick a scrotum suck a dick 
 Down for what I'm up against, clownin' when you see me stylin' 
 Jokin', smilin', scoped your poker face through these black shades 
 (Smokin' on hay) in the middle of the barn 
 At least I think so I can't quite remember where we are 
 All I see is stars nigga, All I see is stars 
 I don't know if I'm on the red carpet or on Mars 
 Shout out to my bitches givin' it up on the first date, Between 21 and 38 (Great) 
 Motherfuck the government, democrats, republicans 
 Can shove it up, where they take a shit, we in this bitch 
 In a sense, I'm militant with a trigger finger itch 
 'Cause I'm always killing it, you see this shit in my cerebral I invent 
 It should be illegal, I admit, surrender quick 
 I wanna see hands and white flags no matter if you teach 
 Eighth grade and you move weight like a gastric bypass 
 Get a good look at my ass before you kiss it, sons of bitches 
 ?, We gon' be here for a minute 
 HiiiPower, pissing on the Declaration 
 Of Independence and you can bet my John Hancock 
 The biggest fuck a proposition, 'less it's in my best, in the west 
 Kissing ratchets in the mouth, ? short dresses 
 Don't be so upset, show some love when you see a thug 
 Getting pita bread, I put the nina to your head 
 You know what I said 
 Soul
