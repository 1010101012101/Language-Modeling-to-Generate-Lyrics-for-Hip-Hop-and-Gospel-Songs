They know I put it down, now they wanna say wassup 
 When you see me in your town say wassup 
 Roll around say wassup 
 Even ones who wear the crown say wassup 
 That's wassup 
 Break it down, that's wassup 
 Blow a pound, that's wassup 
 Aye! 
 And my tail light broke like a promise, homie 
 This the realest shit I wrote, on my mama, homie 
 My teachers used to call my mama on me 
 Now I'm a rapstar and I could fuck my mama's homies 
 Me and ScHoolboy hit the liquor store 
 Chocolate swisha burn slow, how sweet? 
 Who got the dro? Who tryna chief? 
 Like Pocahontas daddy 
 And I'm off that granddaddy kush, I'm finna start a family 
 I'm ghetto, my kool aid need mo suga 
 Five star suite, you ain't know, suga? (you ain't know bitch?) 
 I'm chillin' bumpin' Anita Baker 
 Caked up, they wonder why I don't need a baker 
 But really though I just need a hater 
 So I ask 'em for their number when I see a hater 
 Ask Obama if I don't know about presidents 
 Keep them dead motherfuckers restin' in my money clip 
 They know I put it down now they wanna say wassup 
 When you see me in your town say wassup 
 Roll around say wassup 
 Even ones who wear the crown say wassup 
 That's wassup 
 Break it down, that's wassup 
 Blow a pound, that's wassup 
 Aye! 
 Look up in the mirror and my gangsta told me what it do? 
 Cap'n Crunch and Top Ramen all a nigga ever knew 
 Got a bitch to twist a blunt and pop a nigga collar too 
 Who that nigga standin over there? That's that nigga Q 
 What it do? 
 That's wassup, 
 Bang this in your Tonka truck 
 Everybody rockin' chucks and pistol packin' 
 That's a must 
 Saggin and my ass showin' 
 Mami and the cops knowin' all I wanna do is smoke a blunt 
 Let it bump 
 Yeah I'm lookin' in the mirror and the nigga said wassup, Rock? 
 And that nigga looked back at me and said "Boy, you certified." 
 Took my '87 regal, put it in a chop shop 
 Stash spot, .45 
 Run up, you gonna die 
 Lookin' for a pretty bitch who can twerk it and throw it back 
 Nigga diss me, no I ain't missin' I'm throwin' shots back 
 Jay rock, top cat, and I'm still a Top Dawg 
 Boxed in that Porsche box like I'm fighting south paw 
 They know I put it down now they wanna say wassup 
 When you see me in your town say wassup 
 Roll around say wassup 
 Even ones who wear the crown say wassup 
 That's wassup 
 Break it down, that's wassup 
 Blow a pound, that's wassup 
 Aye! 
 I'm Soulo, take a photo, blowin' do-do in a dojo 
 We a green light, you a no go - Hey Q go! 
 No, Rock go! 
 I'ma rock though, like Barack though 
 And my eyes low and I drive slow like Paul Wall 
 Give it back though, I got y'all 
 Nah fuck that, I'mma ball hog 
 No fuck that, they gon' fall off 
 Gotta sawed off, I'mma hop out, let it all off 
 Hop back in, then haul off 
 We situated, we hit the pavement so hard we all got ground to play with 
 A challenger is like, last year calendars 
 Yup, you're all outdated 
 We all amazing, you all can hate it, you can live or die that's your ultimatum 
 Married to the game at the alter wasted 
 A pound of white rice on the tribe of Asians 
 Niggas they'll ride for me, bitches they desire me 
 And what's the one thing they hate most? 
 Sayin' bye to me! 
 They know I put it down now they wanna say wassup 
 When you see me in your town say wassup 
 Roll around say wassup 
 Even ones who wear the crown say wassup 
 That's wassup 
 Break it down, that's wassup 
 Blow a pound, that's wassup 
 Aye!
