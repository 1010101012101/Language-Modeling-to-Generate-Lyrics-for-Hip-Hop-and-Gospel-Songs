One time for my niggas poured up yup, bachelor 
 Get screwed up like the neck on Frankenstein 
 Purple weed, purple drank, purple swag, purple tag 
 We be getting throwed, We be getting throwed 
 Just copped a pack of Backwoods, I'm sitting high as hell 
 This OG kush suits this Honey Berry well 
 The lights are low, the mood is right 
 I got a fo... that's right I'm tryna get throwed 
 Hit my nigga AJ, heard he bought an 8th 
 My nigga Legend blessed me with a cup the other day 
 Hit my nigga Carver D, Dough boy it ain't crack? 
 Tell him it's a poe party, ASAP 
 Bumping out the speakers, coffee cups with lids 
 This way nobody accidentally ashin' in my shit 
 Got a few two liters and it's about to go down 
 Then again it's the prescription of choice 
 Just call us the Finnegan boys 
 I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick 
 You think you know, but you have no idea 
 The lights are low, the mood is right 
 I got a fo', who got a Sprite? 
 Who got a Sprite? Who got a Sprite? 
 I got a fo', who got a Sprite? 
 I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick 
 You think you know 
 I got this funny little dream of buying out the bar 
 Then flexing in my section like a fucking star 
 They ask me what I like to drink and I say I'm all right 
 Then all you see is my purple sprite, glistening off of the strobe light 
 No jolly ranchers please, this ack? is all I need 
 I hope it ain't cliché to shoot Pimp C a RIP 
 As well as DJ Screw since I made up this tune about lean 
 But as of late, all I see is poe like Section 8 
 The homie say he's got a few tings 
 That's three 16s and a whole lot of cream 
 I crack a ceiling, drop a deuce now I got mixed emotions 
 From here on out, it's slow motion 
 Coming down, still sipping 
 Draped up dripped out, still sipping 
 (Hey-ay-yay-ay) 
 I love the po', more than you'll know. (I love, I love, I love) 
 Gotta let it show. I love the po' 
 Hey! 
 (I love the po')
