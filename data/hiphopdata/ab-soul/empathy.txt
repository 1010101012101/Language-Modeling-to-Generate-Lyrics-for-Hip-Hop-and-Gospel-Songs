 (Verse 1: Ab-Soul) 
 I got seven hundred dollars from my last show 
 And I would spend it all on you 
 So baby won't you fall on through 
 Empathy... Empathy... 
 Empathy... Empathy... 
 It's been a little while since the last time I saw you 
 What's up with you and ol' dude 
 I hope everything is all cool 
 Empathy... Empathy... 
 Empathy... Empathy... 
 (Alori Joh:) 
 Can you feel, what I feel 
 When I feel, What I feel 
 Empathy... Empathy... 
 (Verse 2: Ab-Soul) 
 Lady if you would just give me the time 
 You could just leave all your problems behind 
 You got a past, but that's in the past 
 And we all know that, you can't press rewind 
 I understand, where are you and 
 I lend you a hand, if you wanted mine 
 Pamper you and stand for you 
 The man to, make everything right 
 (Verse 3: Javonte & Absoul) 
 I guess things ain't going as well as you expected 
 But baby don't stress it, I hope you learned a lesson 
 Empathy... Empathy... 
 Empathy... Empathy... 
 I tell you I've been down that road before 
 If anyone can fill you then it's me 
 So why don't you let you garments hit the floor 
 And let me let you feel me 
 Lights please, lights please 
 Light-skinned, mighty fiesty 
 All hope, I see, I see 
 You like me too 
 (Hook: Alori Joh & Ab-Soul) 
 Can you feel, I feel, I feel 
 Empathy
