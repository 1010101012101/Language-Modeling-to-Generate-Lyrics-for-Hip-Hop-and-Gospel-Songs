One time for your mind 
 He with the homies, he with the homies 
 No squares in his circle, nobody phoney 
 He with the homies, he with the homies 
 We don't love them hoes, let's get this money 
 He got a main chick, been with her for a while 
 Love making, and making out 
 His fellas' in his ear, "You acting like a queer 
 You going on dates, we tryna get this cake!" 
 When the pressure group's setting in 
 "If you a real man, you would fuck her friend." 
 Head saying no, other one saying yes 
 His girl girlfriend been with it, it's scandalous 
 Unfasten her clothes, she swore she won't tell a soul 
 The thrill of it all got him off, case closed 
 He hesitated, and she say "Why you push me? 
 If you don't get this pussy, then you a pussy! 
 Nigguh." 
 Tired of living, living, living 
 By this double standard, standard, standard 
 Tired of living, living, living 
 By this double standard, standard, standard 
 She with the girls, she with the girls 
 Hair done, nails done, no care in the world 
 She with the girls, she with the girls 
 They all wifey material, yes sir 
 She want a boyfriend, she been missing out 
 On love making and making out 
 But she ain't having the best luck 
 Everybody who chop it up only want a cut 
 One of her girlfriends got one 
 She been jealous of the relationship since day one 
 But last week he made a pass at her 
 She knew she had him, her ass a little fatter 
 Unbutton his jeans and then she fell to her knees 
 She finally found company for her misery 
 He hesitated, and she say "Why you push me? 
 If you don't get this pussy, then you a pussy! 
 Nigguh." 
 See the moral of the story is 
 She a ho, he a pimp 
 Old girl'll forgive her man 
 But her girlfriend's cut off like Edward's hands 
 What's fucked up is he got at her 
 Bitches call her a rat, but shit she's heard worse 
 To my niggas having bitches, it's what you just do 
 To the bitches having niggas, this what a slut do 
 My auntie told me always treat my lady right 
 My uncle told me only love 'em for a night 
 You can see the immediate disconnection 
 Between a man and a woman, the reason for regression 
 For example, you heard of Amber Cole 
 But you don't know that nigga that was getting dome 
 I'm saying we heard of Amber Cole 
 But we don't know that lil' nigga that was getting dome 
 It's just my interpretation of the situation
