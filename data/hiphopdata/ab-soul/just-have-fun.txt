Yo, have some fun out there 
 Smells like dope in here 
 Everybody out there 
 Don't let drugs do you 
 Smells like dope in here 
 Son, do the drugs don't let drugs do you 
 Son, do the drugs don't let drugs do you 
 Son, do the drugs don't let drugs do you 
 Do the drugs 
 Up jumps the Boogie bitch, I boogie board on these instruments 
 Riding the wave like a lie detector, if I'm lying I'm flying, nah 
 If I'm lying I'm lying, in dirt, that's a metaphor for dying 
 Miming like Morpheus foresaw me saving Zion 
 More fire, that's more fire, that's more fire, that's more (Smoke that weed nigga) 
 Set that mouse trap, you fuck around, yeah you fuck around and get smoked 
 Got that loud pack in these Backwoods like summer camp, burn that (roll that weed nigga) 
 We used to dub cassettes but now we poppin' Percocets 
 I don't be in no pain, I just like how it feels 
 I close my eyes and follow beetles in strawberry fields 
 Munchie munchie, Welch's fruit snacks and Mrs. Fields 
 Wicked as Aleister Crowley do you niggas know the deal? (Son, do the drugs don't let the drugs do you) 
 Psy-Psy-Psychedelic savage and I'm telepathic too 
 Ask Al Boy and A-Mack about when me and Q did shrooms! 
 And that one ho was getting grooved in the next room 
 I flow like, Russel Crowe in a beautiful mind 
 That's a colorful touch like homosexual hugs 
 And I try to tell these motherfuckers all of the time (roll that weed nigga) 
 Don't forget my dash or you'll get left behind! (shake that ass up) 
 I'm fast, another one bites the dust just at the sight of us 
 They liking us, to lightening striking over Mount Everest 
 That ever so, talented establishment 
 TDE, Jay Rock, K Dot, ScHoolboy, me, Soul 
 When I cross the street I look both ways 
 Gazelle frames, paparazzi in my face 
 Niggas talk more than bitches These Days 
 And the new drugs got a nigga trippy These Days! 
 Just have some fun (Got that Dopamine, I mean dope) 
 Yeah, let's have some fun 
 Just have some fun (That Dopamine, I mean dope) 
 Yeah, let's have some fun 
 I just wanna teach you all about the mind 
 The power in it, the very power of mine 
 It makes sense I take interest in the third eye 
 Due to my lack of sight, I guess it's a sacrifice 
 'Cause I've already envisioned what the world looks like 
 So when it's handed to me, I won't need to look twice 
 That's why I read a lot of books, so I got straight A's 
 Katrina cleared my absences so I could walk the stage 
 I never paid tuition, but I paid attention 
 That's why I gotta make it count when they pay admission 
 Took my third hit of DMT and then I melted in (Met the devil in God's elbow) 
 And this is what he said 
 When I cross the street I look both ways 
 Gazelle frames, paparazzi in my face 
 Niggas talk more than bitches These Days 
 And the new drugs got a nigga trippy These Days! 
 Just have some fun (Got that Dopamine, I mean dope) 
 Yeah, let's have some fun 
 Just have some fun (That Dopamine, I mean dope) 
 Just have fun 
 Hi my name is Jimmy 
 (Hi Jimmy) 
 I'm a friend of a rapper 
 You may, you may, also know me as the white Ab-Soul 
 I'm from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania 
 I like Denim Jeans 
 And I'm an alcoholic 
 These days I've seen my best 
 Need be lay me to rest 
 Smoke, drink, relieve my stress 
 Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess 
 These days I've seen my best 
 Need be lay me to rest 
 Smoke, drink, relieve my stress 
 Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess 
 These days I've seen my best 
 Need be lay me to rest 
 Smoke, drink, relieve my stress 
 Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess 
 (Swear to God this the only time I've used this flow) 
 I'm more than man, I died and I rose again 
 I left these holes in my hand just so you know who I am 
 An alien, extraterrestrial, ET's a mini me, you understand? 
 Look what I did, smoke like a chimney 
 Then add to that, that I smoke like the hippies did back in the 70's 
 So many styles I write with a ghost 
 Like I had assistance, but this is just dope, dope 
 Bottles of Belaire, the prince is the freshest 
 Tree by the elbow we get for the LO 
 So I should be happy, but this shit is stressin' 
 Staring at heaven like 
 fuck is perfection? 
 I'm popping downers to deal with depression 
 'Cause when you the plug here come the finessing, finessing 
 Smoking dope with the hitters 
 Don't know no new niggas and business is business 
 Can I get a motherfucking witness? 
 These days I've seen my best 
 Need be lay me to rest 
 Smoke, drink, relieve my stress 
 Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess 
 These days I've seen my best 
 Need be lay me to rest 
 Smoke, drink, relieve my stress 
 Hard times, they got the best of me, I guess
