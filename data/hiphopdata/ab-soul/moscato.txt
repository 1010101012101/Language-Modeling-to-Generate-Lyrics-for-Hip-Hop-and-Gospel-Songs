(You got, you got some more moscato?) 
 Ab Soul: 
 Yeah 
 She's a mean girl 
 I'm a nice guy 
 We all know opposite attract 
 Like a rail road 
 And I like 
 You to do anything you please 
 When you're with me 
 Mama 
 Let's head home 
 And crack a bottle of the Sutter's Home 
 And hit some trees, Why not? 
 Where your head at 
 Hope it's in the gutter like mine 
 Not where you find rats 
 Talkin' about where you find ecstasy 
 Come have a lil bit of sex with me 
 Can I hit it in the mornin' 
 Till the sun has fallin' 
 Like a new born 
 Baby you stallin' 
 You know you want all this 
 Long dick 
 Oh shit 
 Might want to make you my misses 
 Like I lost it 
 Peek-a-boo 
 Lady your smile light up the room 
 Pikachu 
 You could put a nigga in a tomb (What?) 
 Peek-at-chu 
 Let's pop this cork 
 Let me rub on your neck 
 Till your Victoria's secret get all wet 
 And your Victoria's secret safe with me 
 Let me Victoria's secret leave your legs 
 I know you had a hard day baby 
 Relax your mind 
 Shit 
 Soon as Christ turned water into wine 
 Everything was fine 
 When things get hard to swallow 
 We need a bottle of moscatoooooooo 
 Puts me in the moment for your lovin' 
 Ya love it 
 We can even do it tomorrow 
 Just bring a bottle of moscatoooooooo (mm hum yeah, I know we said P&P Baby) 
 Puts me in the moment for your lovin' (But now we on somthin' new) 
 You love it 
 Kendrick Lamar: 
 Guess whose back in this mother fucker 
 Lookin' like a mother fuckin' chi-town pimp 
 All right 
 Make my money flip 
 Make my money flip 
 Make my money flip 
 I'll be in the gym all night 
 Came in the game with a dollar and a dream 
 With an AK clip with an infrared beam 
 I pop that trunk 
 Make everybody scream 
 Put the missing punk 
 On everybody's screen 
 Ain't nothin' changed 'bout the ends I'm holdin' 
 My dick is big and my nuts is swollen 
 I don't know if you've noticed 
 But a nigga be rollin' with a bad bitch 
 And the bitch be rollin' 
 Dolphin pills and moscato spills 
 Everything she need to get her thrill 
 No Hennessey on the bartender bill 
 Just a good wine and a good place to chill 
 I feel I might get loose tonight 
 And fuck your girlfriend 
 I mean I feel she might come through tonight 
 Plus her girlfriend 
 In a 5-Star suite 
 With a 5-Star freak 
 Slingin' that dick while baby eat 
 On her punani 
 Ooh mommys 
 Look at yours bodies 
 I'm geeked 
 Havin' a good time 
 Put my 
 Peen 
 In a muther fuckin' 
 Bottle 
 A chain and a diamond ring don't feel the same 
 If a nigga don't got his eyes closed (eyes closed) 
 I know you had a hard day baby 
 Relax your mind 
 Shit 
 Soon as Christ turned water into wine 
 Everything was fine 
 When things get hard to swallow 
 We need a bottle of moscatoooooooo 
 Puts me in the moment for your lovin' 
 Ya love it 
 We can even do it tomorrow 
 Just bring a bottle of moscatoooooooo 
 Puts me in the moment for your lovin' 
 You love it 
 Ab Soul: 
 I said 
 It's a celebration 
 Clap clap bravo 
 Lobster and shrimp 
 With a glass of moscato 
 What up ho, what up 
 I said 
 What up ho, what up 
 I said 
 It's a celebration 
 Clap clap bravo 
 Lobster and shrimp 
 With a glass of moscato 
 What up ho, what up 
 I said 
 What up ho, what up 
 All right 
 Sip slow 
 Relaxation 
 That's are motto 
 Soul
