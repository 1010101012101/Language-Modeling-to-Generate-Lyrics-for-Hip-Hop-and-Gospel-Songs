Hear a tale part frightening 
 And half the tale enlightening 
 A brave little girl's great sacrifice 
 To hold back the hordes of Hell 
 I was called upon 
 To see little Anneliese 
 Back in the freezing Winter of 1969 
 She was suffering 
 Complaining of voices 
 Chains were restraining 
 The girl to her bed 
 Such menacing messages 
 I can't believe the things she said 
 Fiendish faces haunting her mind 
 Hallucinations of the hideous kind 
 Her room was empty, but oh the smell 
 From the filth 
 She told me stories so hard to believe 
 Wicked possession from six entities 
 Why can't we save poor Anneliese? 
 Dear tell us what's wrong 
 What good is calling on a priest? 
 Possession too strong 
 We need to save her from the beast 
 Girl help us to fight 
 She's looking frail and feeling weak 
 A terrible sight 
 Doctors claiming it's all in her head 
 Demons draining her face turning red 
 Beyond the twilight 
 I saw the evil in her eyes 
 Waiting, hiding the devil inside 
 Changing places, I saw innocent die 
 Anneliese quit fighting 
 The entity claiming its prize 
 Cursing, writhing, the 
 Room cam alive 
 Flashing a fleeting last sinister smile 
 Solo: brogden/garcia 
 Accusations, they started to fly 
 Prosecution, we didn't know why 
 Such inhumanity 
 I could not believe my own eyes 
 The exorcism, they just didn't buy 
 They sent us to prison for taking her life 
 Unburied secrets were exhumed 
 They could not hide the truth 
 They opened her coffin to see what's inside 
 Her corpse was still perfect 
 Ten Years had passed by 
 Her body protected by the Holy Divine 
 Her very last words to the priest 
 Right before her release 
 Were 'tell my mother I am not afraid' 
 From Mother's bedroom she can see 
 Poor little Anneliese 
 Her tombstone less than 50 feet 
 From that very house!
