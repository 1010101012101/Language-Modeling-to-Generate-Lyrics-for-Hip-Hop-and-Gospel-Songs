From days of Salem when the craft became alive. The Wicken way has seen 
 The congregation thrive. The moon and goddess of the earth a solemn face. 
 But soon they sought such power from a darker place. Beguiled trapped under 
 Their spell. Repent be tried be sent to hell. Tied to the cross the witches will burn 
 Alive on this night. White White magic. Turning to black. White magic turning to 
 Black. The Cauldron curses those the witches do despise. They will fall victim to 
 Their wretched evil eyes. The coven instigates the Equinoxal fire witness deliverance 
 To all that they desire 
 They're turning to black 
 They're turning to black
