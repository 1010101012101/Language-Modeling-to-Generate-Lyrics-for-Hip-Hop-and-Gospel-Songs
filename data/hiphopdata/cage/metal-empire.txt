From the earth of old England 
 Came a force full of shattering sound 
 All that were living and breathing 
 Felt it quaking and breaking new ground 
 It mastered our minds and lit up our lives 
 With power to fight all through the night 
 We honor those who have created this sound 
 We bury them deep in hallowed ground 
 We gather tonight to raise our fists up high 
 As long as we are here True Metal will never die 
 Will never die... True Metal... Will never die... 
 True Metal... Will never die... True Metal 
 As long as we are here heavy metal will never die! 
 All hail the Supremacy Of Steel! 
 Fools fail and before us they will kneel 
 With this nail their coffins will be sealed 
 We're here to reclaim it 
 The Metal Empire! 
 The Metal Empire! 
 They told me they burned all metal 
 They said heavy metal had dies 
 We gathered this bold band of rebels 
 And swore we'd defend with our lives 
 With damaging drums and grinding guitar 
 We played every night 
 With leather and spikes 
 Repeat chorus/repeat chorus 
 Solo: brohden/garcia 
 Seeds of steel have been planted 
 Now metal stands stronger and proud 
 The wishes of vikings are granted 
 All hail the lords of the loud 
 Onward the spirit of metal survives 
 Thrashes and thrives for the rest of our lives 
 Repeat prechorus 
 Grown Men Play Metal! 
 Heavy Metal! 
 Long Live True Metal!
