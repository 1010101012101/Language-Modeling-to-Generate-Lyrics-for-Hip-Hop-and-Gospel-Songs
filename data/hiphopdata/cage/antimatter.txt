I'd rather be left alone in you can't confide. You've made your 
 Intentions know you suffocate my mind. There's nothing to fear 
 There's no need to hide cause the pain that I feel keeps on growing 
 Inside and I'm tired of you wasting my time I'm wasting my life with 
 You sick of the sight of you. No feeling no laughter. You wear me 
 Down with antimatter. And from you I'll carry this scar. It makes me 
 Sick that you're the martyr that you are. You let me down time and 
 Time again. You're wasting my time. Within you my faith is hard to 
 Sustain. You're living a lie I've got to get far away from your constrict 
 Vice. Mistakes that I made with you will never happen twice I'm closing 
 You out I'm shutting you down. It's painfully clear I don't want you 
 Around and I'm tired of you wasting my time. I'm wasting my life with 
 You sick of the sight of you 
 Now you're face to face with your mortality victimized inside by mortality. 
 Face to face embrace your own mortality.
