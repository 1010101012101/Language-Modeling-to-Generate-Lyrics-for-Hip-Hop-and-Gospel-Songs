Listen to the sound 
 Of their final heartbeat 
 Pleading from the ground 
 As they lie at my feet 
 Listen to the crowd 
 Growing louder, raging on 
 I walked the path alone 
 That's the way I liked it 
 I kept a heart of stone 
 Just in case they'd knife it 
 But I put the heathen down 
 Now the crown's upon my head! 
 Cast out of shadows and hell 
 I'm drawn into conflict 
 Evil falls from the blade of my knife 
 Nothing worth keeping alive 
 On this wretched wreck of a world 
 Darkness dawns on all who survived 
 Bate them, bathe them in fire 
 Bathe them in fire 
 And hail to the gods of twilight 
 Raze them all who defy us! 
 Those who oppose us 
 Will know I am the divine! 
 Millions are calling my name 
 The king of the wasteland 
 This tyrant was born out of pain 
 Sending them falling 
 The king of the wasteland 
 My enemies rot in their graves 
 A madman with emerald dreams 
 So he decreed it 
 Burnt it black 
 Extinguished all life 
 Out from the caves and the caverns 
 Only the strong could ever survive 
 Take it back 
 What's left of mankind 
 Repat prechorus/chorus 
 Solo: garcia/brogden 
 Humanity's sanity is nowhere in sight 
 Brutal days and hot desert nights 
 Cloaked and killing with speed 
 The wrecker's legend lives on 
 Take the throne, it's my very right! 
 Repat prechorus
