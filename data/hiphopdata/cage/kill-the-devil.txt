The evil one we can defeat him. Our mission make him dead and gone. 
 One from each religion assembled to take him on. They would go to the 
 Ends of the earth and below to end the game and kill the Devil Deception 
 Our greatest weapon the priest in black has joined the cause hell betray 
 His master and then we will strike without pause. Midnight all the power 
 Of light well fool the master of lies and kill the Devil [repeat] 
 Kill Kill the devil. The game was on midnight approaching the dark disciple 
 Made the call. The formless one took shape the sight of him left us in awe 
 Now that we've got you you'll die here today. When hell freezes over you will 
 Stand in my way. Come hell or high water to rest you will lay. When you deal 
 With the devil there will be hell to pay. Blinding light came! The evil is finally 
 Gone the impossible seemingly done. Still we must save ourselves from the 
 Evil that comes from below. The darkness still lingers within us all 
 You've got to kill the Devil!
