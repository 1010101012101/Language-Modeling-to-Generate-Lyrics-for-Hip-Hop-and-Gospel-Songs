Demons are dining on angels tonight 
 Our destiny's drowning in sin 
 Devil of Metal, awake and alive 
 Commanding the shadows again 
 Angels descending but losing the fight 
 He's swatting them out of the sky 
 This massive monstrosity feeds on their lights 
 Growing five hundred feet high 
 Fire is falling down from the sky 
 The Hell Destroyer arrives 
 Face to face, they lock eyes 
 Hell Destroyer, fight fire with fire 
 The blinding light 
 The fallen angel, the armored knight 
 Hell Destroyer rise! 
 And with a scream, returned the night 
 He called it down enveloping this place 
 Face to face, hand to hand 
 They battled all across the land 
 Lightning flashed, thunder roared 
 He amassed an evil horde 
 The angels that survived, they held the line 
 It's do or die 
 Darkness dawned dead of night 
 Blackness spread, no more light 
 Power drained to the dead 
 A place where angels fear to tread 
 His demons joined the fight 
 And turned the tide of battle 
 Has the Hell Destroyer died? 
 Hell Hell Hell Hell, raise some Hell 
 Where the Hell Destroyer fell 
 Hell Hell Hell Hell, break the spell 
 No more world you love so well 
 Burn burn burn burn, burn so bright 
 Flames will bake this world tonight 
 Hey Hey Hey, something's not right! 
 From above a blinding light 
 Bursting with power he rose to his feet 
 The demons blew back in a flash 
 He struck the behemoth with all of his might 
 Buildings were crushed as he crashed 
 Forcing his scepter to its metal face 
 Absolving this cyborg of sin 
 Its life force and memory were both erased 
 We knew Hell Destroyer would win 
 Bolts of white lightning filled the skies 
 Blood stained feather washed immortals gave their lives 
 A battlefield of fallen angels 
 There'll be no afterlife for none of them 
 Fire is falling down from the sky 
 The Hell Destroyer survived 
 The Devil's no longer alive 
 Hell Destroyer, fight fire with fire 
 The blinding light 
 The fallen angel, the armored knight 
 Hell Destroyer rise! 
 Hell Hell Hell Destroyer 
 The final destruction of Hell 
 And from the gleam He appeared there in the sky 
 For all to see and witness His return 
 The Metal Devil's heart is beating nevermore 
 His twisted body lies beneath the angel's heel 
 The Hell Destroyer rips its heart right from the core 
 The fate of evil for eternity is sealed 
 Up from the ground 
 His sign; its bursts in clouds 
 A vision towering 1000 feet it soars 
 All of the angels up in Heaven sing aloud 
 His glory echoing on forevermore!
