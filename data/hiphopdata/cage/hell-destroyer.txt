From the molten sky the angel came 
 A flash of blinding light in the fiery rain 
 Absolution for all demons today 
 I've come down to this place to devastate - All fear the name of the 
 Hell, hell, hell destroyer - Hell, hell, hell destroyer 
 Hell, hell, hell destroyer - Wracking havoc in hell 
 I'm sentencing hell to a permanent fate 
 Armies and legions I obliterate 
 All your cities and towers I render to dust 
 All of you stand before me - Powerless now die by the end of the 
 Hell, hell, hell destroyer - Hell, hell, hell destroyer 
 Hell, hell, hell destroyer - The annihilation of hell 
 All fear the hell destroyer! All fear the hell destroyer! 
 Created from vengeance-and sent down below to slay them with lightning and steel 
 The blacker, the evil the stronger he grows, no mercy or fear does he feel 
 Light kills as he violently vanquishes hell 
 Blood spills as Lucifer's legacy fell 
 By the fire from my wings I'll melt you all to cinders! 
 Now the kingdom of lies is rubble and ash 
 The dreams of devils are forever smashed 
 I echo a scream and soar to the sky 
 I leave my mark behind up from the ground - The towering sign of the hell destroyer 
 Hell, hell, hell destroyer - All hail the new king of hell 
 All fear the hell destroyer! All fear the hell destroyer!
