A week or two, that's all we made it through 
 Bad signs were showing again I just knew 
 We gave up Cassandra so this would not be 
 Annabelle was acting so secretly 
 I had to find out what was behind her strange behaviour 
 Did she think I was blind? 
 Shed lock herself into our room 
 I'd knock and she would not come out 
 I sense immense impending doom 
 I had no doubt, our nightmare was about to begin 
 I was blinded by my rage and seeing red 
 If he did something to my wife I'll have his head 
 There must be something that the Arab had not said 
 I was blinded by my rage and seeing red 
 Then one day I left early in the rain 
 I'd spy on my family make sure they're OK 
 I went to the back, put boxes in a stack 
 Wiped rain from the window and tried to relax 
 My view improved, her clothes were removed 
 I saw baby Jacob and her back was so smooth 
 She had our son a feeding had begun 
 She sat so awkwardly something was wrong 
 I was blinded by my rage and seeing red 
 God only knows what little Jacob had been fed 
 So very strange the way she held her crooked head 
 I was blinded by my rage and seeing red 
 I leapt from the window and ran to the front door 
 Ramming my shoulder to find it was locked 
 Firing my pistol, it blasted to splinters 
 I forced my way into the bedroom and shock 
 Inside I found my bride became a monster 
 Tentacles flailing, they came from her chest 
 Split open wide from her neck to her navel 
 Feeding our son something not from her breast 
 Annabelle's eyes were as white as a blizzard 
 Her jaw was detached with a tongue like a snake 
 Hissing and rasping a voice like a lizard 
 All this insanity too much to take 
 I made my way with my blade to baby Jacob 
 Cutting the sinews that now held my son 
 I recognized just what the hell they were made of 
 The same blackened tissue from when this begun 
 Annabelle fell to the floor she was reeling 
 I grabbed my son knowing her mind's not her own 
 I wanted to kill her right there was my feeling 
 Then saw her change back to her human form 
 I tied her up loaded her into the carriage 
 Dropped off my son to Mrs. Watkins close home 
 Racing to Allistar to save my marriage 
 Never before have I felt so alone
