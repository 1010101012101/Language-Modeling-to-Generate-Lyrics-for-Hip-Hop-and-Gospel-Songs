The metal gods has spoken, with fire and light 
 You are the chosen, to join us tonight 
 So prepare for battle or you'll be defeat 
 Tonight we wake the dead to ours knee 
 Up from the embers they rise no fear on their faces 
 Down from the silvery skies we've taking to flight 
 Burning hot beams from our eyes they'll never enslave us 
 Destiny dares us to die in battle tonight 
 Nightfall has chained the light 
 Summoned we are saviours, we live to fight (you all will fail!) 
 A tyrant with blackend eyes 
 Standing to engage us, without disguise 
 I am a wrecking ball, my roar is deafening 
 I'll devastate you all, I'll bring a reckoning 
 A wrecking ball, my roar is deafening 
 I'll liberate you all and end your suffering 
 Bloodsteel, bloodsteel, bloodsteel 
 Waiting for it's victim 
 Power it flows through our veins like living lightning 
 The landscape is littered with fire as it falls from the sky 
 Such venomous violence and rage we are inciting 
 Mountains are rendered to dust in the blink of an eye 
 I am a wrecking ball, my roar is deafening 
 I'll devastate you all I'll bring a reckoning 
 A wrecking ball, my roar is deafening 
 I'll liberate you all and end your suffering 
 Bloodsteel (silver and red) 
 Bloodsteel (alive and dead) 
 Bloodsteel (off with your head) 
 Waiting for it's victim 
 Bloodsteel (immortal and wise) 
 Bloodsteel (saviour of lives) 
 Bloodsteel (the perfect divide) save you from this prison 
 Bloodsteel, bloodsteel, bloodsteel 
 Bloodsteel, bloodsteel, bloodsteel 
 Our tyranny towers forever gleaming like twilight 
 Oblivion swifty surrounds the dreams of the damned 
 Nightfall has chained the light 
 Summoned we are saviours, we live to fight (you all will fail!) 
 A tyrant with blackend eyes 
 Standing to engage us, without disguise 
 I am a wrecking ball, my roar is deafening 
 I'll devastate you all I'll bring a reckoning 
 A wrecking ball, my roar is deafening 
 I'll liberate you all and end your suffering 
 Bloodsteel (silver and red) 
 Bloodsteel (alive and dead) 
 Bloodsteel (off with your head) 
 Waiting for it's victim 
 Bloodsteel (immortal and wise) 
 Bloodsteel (saviour of lives) 
 Bloodsteel (the perfect divide) save you from this prison 
 Bloodsteel, bloodsteel, bloodsteel (once concealed) 
 Bloodsteel, bloodsteel, bloodsteel (now revealed) 
 Bloodsteel, bloodsteel, bloodsteel (the fallen kneel) 
 Bloodsteel, bloodsteel, bloodsteel! 
 I am a wrecking ball!
