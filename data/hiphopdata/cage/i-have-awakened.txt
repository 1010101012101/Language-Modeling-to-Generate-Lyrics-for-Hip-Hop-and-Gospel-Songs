There we stood paralyzed in the starry night as the creature slowly slithered 
 Its way towards the few of us that were still alive. As it towered over us it was 
 Deep inside our conscious minds in complete control of our nervous systems 
 Then, all at once I was bombarded with a rush of its psychic memories and 
 Impressions as it communicated an impossible amount of data to me in a 
 Way that would have driven most men mad 
 Were that I was able to explain to you the cosmic nature of this forbidden 
 Knowledge, but alas, the human language is laughably inadequate and 
 Incapable of such description. Let it be said that the creature is made up of 
 Harnessed, concentrated, pure evil. 
 Born from a race as old as the stars themselves and quite transdimensional 
 As well it seems. Then it spoke to us a message that still echoes in my head 
 To this day. 
 "You are to be my vessels, my slaves, for I have awakened." Then it sealed 
 Itself back within the massive stone sarcophagus from which it came. 
 We labored for weeks as we dragged it across the desert to the nearest 
 Seaport. It was quite easy to commandeer some pirates who lusted for gold, 
 To take us and our new master here to London.
