We took to the skies 
 And broke through the clouds on that fateful day 
 Into a formation we never should break 
 What some called the Flying Fortress 
 Was wings on a bulletproof Cage 
 With 13 machine guns a crew barely of age 
 As we fly into enemy space 
 The air is alive with the scream of a deafening huna 
 Our mission is critical 
 Ho price is too high to pay 
 Here they come... 
 Fighters swarming and blasting guns 
 From tyrants freedom must be saved 
 One in five won't come back alive 
 Glory shines upon the brave 
 300 Luftwaffe met us with all guns ablaze 
 They stood right between us 
 And the Messerschmitt line 
 Our gunners frantically followed their flight paths 
 Defending our planes spiralling downward 
 Good young men died 
 As the Allies shot down in flames 
 Just a few of us made it our target is nearly in sight 
 Just a few more moments and then it's bombs away... blasted to dust 
 Bombers diving with few surviving 
 But still we will have victory 
 Through our sites the ground ignites 
 Europe finally will be free 
 SOLO: McGINNIS/GARCIA 
 Just a few made it back to the base 
 Some crashed upon landing and others into the sea 
 Over 70 planes and 650 men lost... Black Thursday 
 Bombers diving with few surviving 
 But still we will have victory 
 Through our sites the ground ignites 
 Europe finally will be free!
