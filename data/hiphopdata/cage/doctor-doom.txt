Under the heels of the Baron 
 My family was hunted like dogs 
 My mother was slain by a demon 
 My father was also to fall 
 I spent my life with the Gypsies, 
 Evading the Baron by stealth 
 My keen intellect I worked to perfect 
 While I swindled the rich of their wealth 
 I went to America, studied the sciences 
 And deeply embraced the occult 
 My darkest desire was to break through the fire 
 And reach a specific result 
 My mother was taken, her soul sold to Satan 
 My life for that she would be freed 
 I built a machine so that she could be seen 
 This device will be just what I need 
 Doctor Doom is the name that strikes fear in all men 
 Doom will obliterate, Doom will defend 
 Doom is your destiny, darker than black 
 Doom is my name and I'm born to attack 
 Von Doom is the conqueror behind the mask 
 Kneel before Doom, don't make me ask 
 Doom is an intellect second to none 
 The king of the world, there can only be one 
 Doctor Doom 
 Doom! 
 Reed Richards rigged my machine 
 It exploded and ruined my face 
 I quickly took flight in the dark of the night 
 Awash with shame and disgrace 
 I went to Tibet and discovered a cult, 
 And learned the might of their ways 
 I assembled my armor and menacing mask 
 That mirrored my bloodlust and craze 
 No one has ever laid eyes 
 Upon this hideous face 
 There is no one more I despise 
 Than the one who made me this way 
 I rule with an iron fist 
 And I'll crush all those who oppose 
 Armored in metal and chosen at birth 
 The Lord of Latveria and soon all the Earth! 
 Come bring it on, I'll take them all 
 Defender or Avenger or the Hated Four! 
 My castle soars, my minions roar 
 I'll make the world my kingdom 
 I will reign forevermore! 
 No one has ever laid eyes 
 Upon this hideous face 
 There is no one more I despise 
 Than the one who made me this way 
 I rule with an iron fist 
 And I'll crush all those who oppose 
 Armored in metal and chosen from birth 
 The Lord of Latveria and soon all the Earth! 
 All hail Doom!
