I awoke from my sleep 
 Terror constricting me tight 
 Something quite wicked 
 Has come for my spirit tonight 
 There in the trees a woman was floating on air 
 Just like bloody crimson 
 Her billowing dress and her hair 
 She'll curse you with her evil eye 
 Into the blackest night she'll fly 
 Seduction by forbidden sex 
 You will fall victim to her hex 
 The Scarlet Witch 
 She's taking to flight again 
 The Scarlet Witch 
 I'm under her spell again 
 The Scarlet Witch 
 She's looking for love again 
 The Scarlet Witch 
 She sails on the southern wind 
 Daring to look my eyes were drawn to her face 
 I was her chosen that is why 
 She had come to this place 
 I felt myself losing control 
 Falling under her spell 
 The shame of my actions 
 Are details I can't ever tell 
 With a word and the tail of a rat 
 By the door her prowling black cat 
 Chains on my wrists locked to the floor 
 She used me in unimaginable ways 
 Sadistic pleasure scratching my back 
 I served her needs until my bones cracked 
 The only way she knows how to love 
 My will has finally begun to succumb 
 Savage seduction poison from venomous lips 
 Men turned to slaves 
 Victims from her evil kiss 
 By the queen of all covens 
 All of the kings have been cursed 
 I was the last to resist now completely I'm hers 
 Beware the witch burn alive tonight
