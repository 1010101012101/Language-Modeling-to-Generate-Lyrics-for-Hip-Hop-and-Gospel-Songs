Know the message of the blessed three given the gift of prophecy of the twentieth 
 Century the virgin Mary gave 
 One by one the secrets came sworn to be true in god's 
 Name look to the sky the three children claimed and doubt would remain 
 The secrets 
 Of evil the secrets all evil 
 They try to hide away the secrets of the future 
 They hide it all 
 Away from a people gripped in fear they'll take to the grave they never will reveal it 
 We never will saved until we finally hear 
 The third of the secret tells a terrible tale 
 Visions of death and destruction evil prevails 
 A time will come the say when the faithful 
 Fear no longer 
 They call it judgment day and they say it is finally here 
 All of Fatima's 
 Faithful in the crowd 
 Thousands gathering then a gasping sound I tell you no lie the sun 
 Came alive in the sky witnessed it with my own eyes at precisely the moment the children 
 Had prophesized 
 Staring at the sun with their naked eyes turning bloody red miracles alive 
 Violently spinning around strange colors were bathing the town I thought that the end had 
 Begun as fiery ball unbelievably crashed to he ground 
 All would hear what the seers 
 Would say but the church hid the secrets away 
 Number two was revealed too late as a 
 Peaceful world decayed 
 The warning told of coming genocide and then the rising crimson 
 Tide 
 It must be stopped and cast aside or all mankind will pay 
 Final images angel holds a blade penance to the world as a bishop is slain 
 Our fate 
 Most surely is sealed the third secret finally revealed an impression of horror and pain 
 A corruption of the divine chaos will reign
