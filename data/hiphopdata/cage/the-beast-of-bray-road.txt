Slashing, tearing, scanning and scaring... THE BEAST! 
 I spent my life hunting and searching 
 For creatures whose existence 
 Had hid from our sight 
 In this endeavor forever 
 This treasure nearly has taken my life 
 My most recent attraction 
 My craving for action 
 On my mind this bears quite a load 
 A true paranorm, from man it transforms 
 To the Beast - The Beast of Bray Road 
 Slashing, tearing, scanning and scaring... 
 THE BEAST! Nothing can hide from his hunger 
 THE BEAST! Beware The Beast of Bray Road 
 Someone is human no longer 
 THE BEAST! They call him The Beast of Bray Road 
 A frenzy of fear you'll succumb to 
 THE BEAST! It feels like your heart will explode 
 Nowhere t hide or to run to 
 THE BEAST! You're a feast for The Beast of Bray Road 
 Lead: brogden 
 I first saw him in Elkhorn, Wisconsin 
 Not far from Black River Falls 
 Somewhere between a wolf and a bear 
 With ravenous teeth and razor-like claws 
 Frozen and fighting to focus my gaze 
 My eyes betrayed as I started in the dark 
 A black dogged and howled with an inhuman bark 
 Slashing, tearing, scanning and scaring... 
 This wicked curse is on his head 
 His trail of blood it knows no end 
 Put him down he'll rise again 
 The scent of fear is on the wind 
 Solo: brogden/garcia/brogden 
 Slashing, tearing, scanning and scaring... 
 Adrenaline rushed to my head 
 As the hair on its neck stood up to attack 
 The glow of his eyes 
 Matched the moon with its size 
 Both yellow and round, I dared not stare back 
 Instead I just fled, I ran to the road 
 In hopes I would not be devoured 
 The sounds that it made as it my flesh was filleted 
 Filled the night with horror for hours! 
 Slashing, tearing, scanning and scaring... THE BEAST!
