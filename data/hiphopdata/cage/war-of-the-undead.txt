The graveyards all have been emptied 
 The earth lies disturbed from the mist 
 Humanity caught in the middle 
 Of a pestilent paradigm shift 
 Breaking our from their coffins 
 And pouring out from the morgues 
 They feast upon entrails and organs 
 On human brains they engorge 
 This is a war - War of the undead! 
 This is a war - War of the undead! 
 We hid from the horror and terror 
 Oh how quickly it spread 
 They resisted all forms 
 Of our violent attacks 
 But feel from the loss of their head 
 As the war waned on 
 The world was a wasteland 
 A deluge of death and decay 
 Humanity lies on the edge of extinction 
 The end growing closer each day 
 This is a war - War of the undead! 
 This is a war - War of the undead! 
 Endlist in the war - War of the undead! 
 This is a war - War of the undead! 
 Solo: brogden 
 On the night of the harvest moon 
 An innatural total eclipse 
 The sky rained fire an unholy desire 
 A single word rang from his lips 
 Rise he said, rise and go forth 
 Take the lifeblood from all in this land 
 This was the first day the living 
 Would make its final last stand 
 Solo: garcia 
 Carcasses littered the streets 
 Carrion covered in blood 
 We will never give in to defeat 
 But how can this foe bee withstood? 
 Oh many lives has been taken away? 
 It's so insane 
 Lord, why have we all been forsaken today 
 Are we to blame? 
 Please lord save us from the madness and the pain 
 Will we saved? 
 Will we see the light of day reign? 
 This is a war - War of the undead! 
 This is a war - War of the undead! 
 This is war!
