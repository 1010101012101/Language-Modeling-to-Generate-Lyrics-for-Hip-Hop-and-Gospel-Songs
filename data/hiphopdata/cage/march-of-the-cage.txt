We take on the world wherever we go. Nothing will stop us that is our 
 Oath. All of the evil beneath crawling up from below. We will deliver 
 Defeat we won't take anymore. Marching forever we go but we want to 
 Go higher. Follow us straight down the road and into the fire 
 With infinite malice we shatter the night and then we destroy in the 
 Name of what's right. Under our flickering glow like a beacon we shine. 
 The fallen will cower in fear to our all seeing eye 
 The frequency that we invoke is your purifier 
 Listen your life in danger. Fortune and fame don't make them a stranger. 
 Follow you heart and you're laughing at danger. Run to your dreams and go! 
 March of the CAGE!
