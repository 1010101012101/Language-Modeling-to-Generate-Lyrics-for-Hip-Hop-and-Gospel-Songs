We came from the valley below and with our naked eyes 
 We saw the saviour being crucified 
 His sacrifice was so clear, for all our sins he died 
 Now you'll see fire falling from the sky 
 Destruction by fire - From the sky 
 The wrath of the sire - From the sky 
 All is forever changing and all of you 
 Heathens be frightened and know 
 The winds of change will blow 
 All will be conquered by... 
 The christhammer will strike the evil down 
 He'll rock the earth and shake the ground 
 Calling! The christhammer will crush the infidels 
 He will return, send you to hell 
 Alone I was stricken to be the one with second sight 
 Chosen to see then lead the circle of light 
 I hid the hammer away, then the future to me was revealed 
 I scribed my visions of the broken seals 
 Four horsemen coming - Seven seals 
 Broken and bloody - Fate revealed 
 A revelation for you all 
 Heathens be frightened and know 
 The winds of change will blow 
 All will be conquered by... 
 The christhammer will strike the evil down 
 He'll rock the earth and shake the ground 
 Calling! The christhammer will crush the infidels 
 He will return, send you to hell 
 Surrender yourself 
 Fall to your knees 
 Hear my words 
 Believe what I say 
 The twenty-first century dawns, the battle still rages for power 
 All of us know we face our darkest hour 
 The lords of chaos reveal the wickedness of their plan 
 They seek to recreate the son of man 
 Menacing demons - Son of man 
 Angels are screaming - Son of man 
 Time for redeeming and banish you 
 Heathens be frightened and know 
 The winds of change will blow 
 All will be conquered by... 
 The christhammer will strike the evil down 
 He'll rock the earth and shake the ground 
 Calling! The christhammer will crush the infidels 
 He will return, save you as well 
 The christhammer calling! 
 The christhammer calling! 
 The christhammer calling! 
 The christhammer calling! 
 Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! 
 Christhammer! Hammer! Hammer! 
 The power of the christhammer
