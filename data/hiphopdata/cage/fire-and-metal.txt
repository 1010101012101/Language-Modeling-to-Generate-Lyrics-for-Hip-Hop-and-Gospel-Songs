Children of devastation, we have hell on the run 
 We are seizing salvation with the fire and metal from our guns 
 Slaying remnants of legions, blast them down as they run 
 Victimized by a treason - Megadeath by megatons 
 One mighty nation under god 
 It's kill or be killed - So kill them all 
 Fire and metal will meet - Eye for an eye 
 Vengeance is coming, you better retreat - Eye for an eye 
 The sleeper has awakened now our justice will be done 
 Rewriting the lines in the sand - Revelate them 
 Striking down the forsaken with unspeakable rage 
 For our fallen this modern crusade - Extermination 
 One mighty nation under god 
 It's kill or be killed - So kill them all 
 Fire and metal will meet - Eye for an eye 
 Vengeance is coming, you better retreat - Eye for an eye 
 Forever will freedom be saved - Eye for an eye 
 By soldiers that fight from the home of the brave - Eye for an eye 
 Fire and metal will meet tonight 
 Fire and metal we will unite 
 Fire and metal will meet tonight 
 Fire and metal they will ignite 
 Fire and metal will ignite
