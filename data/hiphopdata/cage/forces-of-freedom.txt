Every thing changed. This glorious land shall not be the same 
 Oh those things that we saw on that on one fateful day 
 We stand ready to fight. Liberty guides us we follow her light 
 And we will carry on the American way. And the drums of the 
 Brave begin playing their song. The flag is being waved showing 
 Freedom lives on god bless the Forces of Freedom and those who 
 Protect God bless the US of A. From the skies we will come then 
 We'll take to the ground and do what must be done. To avenge 
 Those we're lost they did not die in vein. Shining stars in the sky 
 Well there's one for each hero who gave up their lives. Their 
 Memories will survive heavy hearts feel the pain. And the drums of 
 The brave begin playing their song. The flag is being raised showing 
 Freedom lives on god bless the forces of freedom and those who 
 Protect god bless the U S of A. God bless the souls of our fallen 
 In peace may they rest. We will never forget that September day 
 That September day god bless the U S of A.
