She fucked me like she loved me then treat me like she don't need me. Looked me in my eye and deceive me, laugh for no reason. Foolish is my pride, don't know why I believed, 'cause she tell me that it's mine when I'm hitting it from behind every time. Every time she be like, "It's all yours." Really think I might go cures but see me I like victors. I'm the type to drop a line like, "Can you keep a secret? Can you keep it wet? If so I'm diving in the deep end." On the way OT I might just fly you in this weekend. And I'm not trying to play no games, nah I'm not trying to play no games. You might as well not wear no panties. I'm the type to tear them off then tricking if you enjoying yourself but personally I don't care what it costs. 
 Just fuck me like you love me then treat me like you don't need me. When we out in public, act like you don't see me. Yeah this is our little secret as long as you keep it one hundred. I'ma keep it a thousand, I got it if you need it. 
 Can I get some bread? Can I, can I get some bread? You'll never guess what she said. Can I get some bread? Can I, can I get some bread? 
 Paying for the meal if the head game right. Paying for the room, not staying for the night. She got a man all right, but he ain't laying it right. She be like stop then keep going. Have her tweaking in the coup like smoker. Call her Felicia, how D boy. 
 Beat it up, have her calling into work late. Fuck around get fired on an off day. No sleep might need a cup of coffee. Have you where you can't even walk straight. Just bite the pillow, don't talk back (shut up). Textin back, you hyperventilate. Cut that phone off, tell 'em you lost your charger. Do this shit tomorrow. First rule in business, keep 'em out your business. We just creeping, freaking, I'ma kill that pussy. We don't need no witness. My last bitch just wanted to fight. She don't get it, we don't need commitment, we just need each other for thirty minutes.
