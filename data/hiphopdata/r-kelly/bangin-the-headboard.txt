Feel so freaky 
 I feel so freaky 
 Listen 
 There's something about the way you look at me 
 And it's got me imaginin' and seein' things 
 Like us both in a room 
 At my domain 
 About to blow up and 
 And hit like a hurricane 
 And I can't take it no more 
 And you can't fake it no more 
 Playin' hard to get girl 
 Please leave that thought outside the door 
 'Cause the truth of the matter is that you want me and I want you up 
 So let's quit playin' around and let's get our ass up under this cover 
 (Ooh) 
 There's so many things I want to do to you 
 (Ooh) 
 There's so many things I want for you 
 (Ooh) 
 On this night I'll make sure you won't regret it 
 What you and me did in this bed 
 Girl we'll be bangin',' bangin', bangin', bbbangin', 
 The headboard 
 Bangin', bangin', bangin', bbbangin', 
 The headboard 
 Bangin', bangin', bangin', bbbangin', 
 The headboard 
 Banging', bangin', bangin', bbbangin', 
 The headboard 
 And ooh (ooh) it feels just like we're floatin' in this pool 
 And the water bought this fire out of you 
 And there ain't no other girl on this earth I choose 
 Baby but you 
 And I'm going to rock that body fast to sleep 
 (Girl once you have had enough) 
 And you goin' to give that body back to me 
 (As soon as you wake up) 
 Startin' back all over again 
 Second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth wind 
 Till the mornin' comes 
 I'm goin' to be in (yeah) 
 (Ooh) 
 There's so many things I want to do to you 
 (Ooh) 
 And there's so many things I want for you 
 (Ooh) 
 On this night I'll make sure you won't regret 
 What me and you did in this bed 
 (Did, ooh) 
 Girl we'll be bangin', bangin', bangin', bbbangin' 
 The headboard

 Baby hold the pillow tight it's bout to be a wild night 
 Squeak in the bed 
 And we'll going to make the walls bang 
 Squeak in the bed 
 And baby-girl I hope that you can hang

 When were bangin', bangin', bangin', (Yeah)
