Out of all the girls I've loved before 
 Out of all the stages I've performed on 
 Out of all of the cities I've been to 
 I bless the day that I found you 
 I bless the day I found you and that's my word 
 It's nothing for me out there in those streets 
 You took my heart and you set it on fire 
 And now my love forever burns 
 You keep taking me higher
