Baby, I'm so glad you're over here 
 Now I get to show you all the things 
 That I been wanting to show you for such a long time 
 Don't say nothin' 
 Picture this you and me in the kitchen babe, on the counter 
 Feeding each other fruits babe 
 Straight from there walk into the bedroom babe 
 I touch your hair and then you turn around and say what's on your mind 
 And girl tonight we'll be making sweet love
