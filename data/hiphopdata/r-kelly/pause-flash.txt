Uh yeah, check, one, two, it's the piper 
 (Ooh yeah, yeah yeah) 
 (Ooh yeah, yeah yeah) 
 Aka Kellz 
 I'm in the building right now and uh 
 I'm looking for nothing but steppers 
 (Tell me where the steppers are) 
 So get on the dance floor and come on 
 (Where are all the steppers at?) 
 Uh, I feel good 
 (Ooh ooh) 
 I mean, I don't mean to brag, but uh 
 Custom green suit, apple gators 
 Hundred thousand on my wrist 
 Pinky shining, could be diamond 
 White TL linen outfits 
 Jump out styling, ladies smiling 
 Paparazzis everywhere 
 Hummer, Stetches, Limo, Lexus 
 Pull up while people stop and stare 
 (The whole scene looks like we're all on TV) 
 Sometimes life can be like a dream 
 When you're living on the big screen 
 Fancy cars, movie stars 
 Red carpets and big applause 
 Limousines and search lights 
 This is how we gonna do it tonight, so 
 Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash 
 You and your partner are so so clean 
 So take a picture for the memory 
 Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash 
 Ooh, I wanna go stepping now 
 Step down tension about to climb 
 (All I need is my partner) 
 (We go together like a hand in glove) 
 Oh DJ, put the record on 
 Picture it's my favorite song 
 (Step in the name of love) 
 One more, yeah 
 (Step in the name of love) 
 (The whole scene looks like we all on TV) 
 Sometimes life can be like a dream 
 When you're living on the big screen 
 Fancy cars, movie stars 
 Red carpets and big applause 
 Limousines and search lights 
 This is how we gonna do it tonight, so 
 Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash 
 You and your partner are so so clean 
 So take a picture for the memory 
 Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash 
 You know us, whoa 
 (You know us) 
 You know how we like to dress up and go out 
 (And go out and hit the club) 
 I'm not leaving here until I take me a picture 
 (Camera man, just wait till I'm ready) 
 Oh yeah 
 (And you can take a pic) 
 On three y'all, one, two, three, say cheese 
 Fancy cars, movie stars 
 Red carpets and big applause 
 Limousines and search lights 
 This is how we gonna do it tonight, so 
 Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash 
 You and your partner are so so clean 
 So take a picture for the memory 
 Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash 
 Fancy cars, movie stars 
 Red carpets and big applause 
 Limousines and search lights 
 This is how we gonna do it tonight, so 
 Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash 
 You and your partner are so so clean 
 So take a picture for the memory 
 Pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash, pause, flash
