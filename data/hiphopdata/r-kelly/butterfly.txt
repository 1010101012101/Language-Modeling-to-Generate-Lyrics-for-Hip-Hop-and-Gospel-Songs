There's no such thing as pain when I'm with you 
 And it will never rain as long I'm around you 
 My struggles don't exist since I met you you 
 Don't have to search nomore since my eyes found 
 You 
 I'm honored to be lying here next to you watering 
 Seeds and watching them grow with you 
 O girl this lovemaking bond between us two 
 Has captivated my whole understanding Boo it's so 
 Unreal to good to be true how I feel when I'm inside 
 Of you something like a miracle but all so spiritual 
 Staring in your eyes while your juices flow 
 You're so beautiful Oh you make my life so 
 Beautiful Girl in my eyes you are my butterfly 
 Girl you spread your wings just like a butterfly 
 And then you take flight just like a butterfly 
 Bouncing through the wind just like a butterfly 
 And then you landed on me like a butterfly 
 Girl you warm my heart like a butterfly 
 And you swoop through my garden like butterfly 
 Soak up the sun just like a butterfly 
 And then you landed on me I'm so glad 
 You landed on me Bum Bum Bum Bum Bum 
 I'm so thankful heaven sent peace to me 
 And I'm proud to be sharing the same air you 
 Breathe whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

 Summer breeze, my April spring 
 Plus whenever I'm near you girl I feel butterflies 
 Within me

 Seeds and watching them grow with you
