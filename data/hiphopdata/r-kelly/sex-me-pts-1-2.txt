Yeah 1993 
 Check this freaky style 
 I feel so freaky tonight 
 And I need someone to make me feel all right 
 So bring your body here baby 
 Lady have no fear 
 I'm gonna fulfill your fantasies 
 Just as long as you 
 Oh 
 Sex me baby 
 Baby 
 Come on, come on, come on, come on 
 Sex me, baby baby, sex me 
 Sex me, baby baby, sex me 
 Come over here and let me take off your clothes 
 Things I wanna do to you, nobody has to know, no baby 
 So lay your body right here 
 Lady have no fair 
 Cause ecstasy is near 
 Any unexpected position 
 Bring it on 
 Any secret fantasy 
 Baby, I'll fulfill as long as you sex me 
 Now let me feel your body next to mine 
 Cause girl I wanna see you sweat 
 Oh, you're so very wet, baby 
 Now put me inside of you 
 Do what you wanna do 
 Cause you got a need for me 
 And I got a need for you 
 Anything unexpected 
 Any unexpected position, baby 
 Bring it on 
 Any secret fantasy 
 You see I will fulfill as long as you sex me 
 Let me kiss you in the right place 
 So I can see, 'sex me baby', written on your face 
 Slow baby, slow baby, steady as we go 
 Up and down to a 69 temple 
 Yeah, now through your body all around 
 And let me hear you make the 'oh ah' sound 
 'Cause I'm your lover man 
 So call your other man, and say you've found another man 
 (Chorus: Repeats)
