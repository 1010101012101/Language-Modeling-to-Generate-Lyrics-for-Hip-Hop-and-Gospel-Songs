Man I walk up in the club 
 And there she is 
 Sittin' with her man, lookin' at me 
 So I walk to the bar and buy me a drink 
 And then I look over my shoulder 
 She's still lookin' at me 
 So I walk through the club, actin' like I don't see her 
 U know keepin' it cool 'n' shit, when I really wanna meet her 
 And she bite her lips like she ain't just (??) 
 So I post it up like I'm patient 
 Waitin for her man to go to the bathroom 
 And then we catch a break 
 Cause dude steps away 
 And that's all I need for me to make my move 
 Said I know you got a man but I don't care 
 Cause you lookin' at me girl like "i don't care" 
 And just so he don't be mad 
 Gotta stay two steps ahead 
 Take my number call me text me whatever 
 I don't care 
 Now here he comes on his way back from the bathroom 
 Shh... we gotta keep this between me and u 
 Now I'm gonna walk away cause hes movin kinda fast 
 And if he asks about me babe 
 Then I'm a friend from your past 
 (??) While we'll be sexin undercover 
 See I just wanna be your secret lover 
 So chill with him tonight babygirl I'm leavin' 
 U just hit me up and we'll be often here next weekend 
 Believe me believe me, I wanna hit that 
 Believe me believe me, Baby real rap 
 Said I know you got a man but I don't care 
 Cause you lookin' at me girl like "i don't care" 
 And just so he don't be mad 
 Gotta stay two steps ahead 
 Take my number call me text me whatever 
 I don't care 
 Now some may say that's a shame 
 But I'm playin' the game 
 Either dude is a lame 
 Oh shorty know my name 
 And its very easy to see 
 Shorty wanna be with me 
 (??) While hes buyin her drinks 
 I'll be buyin her minks 
 Said I know you got a man but I don't care 
 Cause you lookin' at me girl like "i don't care" 
 And just so he don't be mad 
 Gotta stay two steps ahead 
 Take my number call me text me whatever 
 I don't care 
 - - - - 
 I'm lookin' at her 
 She lookin' back 
 She with her man; forget that 
 I gotta have her like my money stack 
 I gotta ride her like my cadillac 
 (?Don't really get the sentence right here?) 
 Download for music, I download your girl 
 Said I know you got a man but I don't care 
 Cause you lookin' at me girl like "i don't care" 
 And just so he don't be mad 
 Gotta stay two steps ahead 
 Take my number call me text me whatever 
 I don't care
