Yo. What's up baby? 
 I don't see any sign on my door that says it's closed 
 Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you 
 In my room and I know you're gonna like it baby 
 Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you 
 In my room 
 Finally we're all alone so lock all the doors and unplug the phone 
 I wanna take you where passion lies 
 Girl you want my lovin'; I can see it in your eyes 
 Baby don't hold back the feelin' - just bring your body to me 
 And I'm gonna give you everything you need 
 Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you 
 In my room and I know you're gonna like it baby 
 Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you 
 In my room 
 Makin' sweet love 'til morning comes 
 Still lovin' you after it's said and done 
 And doin' those things you want me to do to you baby 
 Like goin' down on you by the fireplace 
 Baby don't hold back the feelin' - just bring your body to me 
 And I'm gonna give you everything you need 
 Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you 
 In my room and I know you're gonna like it baby 
 Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you 
 In my room 
 Hey there lady, you drive me crazy 
 Sexy lady, you drive me crazy 
 Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you 
 In my room and I know you're gonna like it baby 
 Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you 
 In my room
