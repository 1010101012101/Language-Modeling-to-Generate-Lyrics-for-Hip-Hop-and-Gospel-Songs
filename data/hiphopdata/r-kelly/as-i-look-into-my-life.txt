(As I look into my life) 
 (Searching for that paradise) 
 Oh Lord, will you help me find me 
 Take this crazy, crazy past of mine 
 And put it all behind me 
 Look down on the ghetto man 
 And change his mission 
 And put it in the hearts of many 
 To stop confusion 
 (As I look into my life) 
 (Searching for that paradise) 
 We need to moan for love 
 My sisters, brothers 
 Let's put these hands together 
 (As I look into my life) 
 We need to stop chokin' on the truth 
 (Searching for that paradise) 
 And start smokin' on a plan 
 Man love and respect that woman 
 And bring her happiness 
 (As I look into my life) 
 I'm talkin' to the ghetto 
 (Searching for that paradise) 
 For each other we should help 
 While our babies are dying in the street 
 We've got to be saying to ourselves 
 (As I look into my life) 
 (Searching for that paradise)
