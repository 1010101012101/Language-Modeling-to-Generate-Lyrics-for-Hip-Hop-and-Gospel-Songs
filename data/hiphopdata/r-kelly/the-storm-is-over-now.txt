I was in a tunnel 
 And couldn't see the light 
 And whenever I'd look up 
 I couldn't see the sky 
 Sometimes when I'm standin' 
 It seems like I done walked for miles 
 And my heart could be cryin' 
 Dead in the middle of a smile 
 But then I climbed the hills 
 And saw the mountains 
 I hollered help 'cause I was lost 
 Then I felt the strong wind 
 Heard a small voice sayin' 
 The storm is over 
 (The storm is over now) 
 And I can see the sunshine 
 (Somewhere beyond the clouds) 
 I feel Heaven, yeah 
 (Heaven is over me) 
 Come on and set me free, whoa 
 Now in the midst of my battle 
 All hope was gone 
 Downtown in a rushed crowd 
 And felt all alone 
 And every now and then 
 I felt like I would lose my mind 
 I've been racin' for years 
 And still no finish line, oh 
 But then I climbed the hills 
 And saw the mountains (Mountains) 
 I hollered help 'cause I was lost 
 Then I felt the strong wind 
 And then a small voice sayin' 
 The storm is over 
 (The storm is over now) 
 And I can see the sunshine 
 (Somewhere beyond the clouds) 
 I can feel Heaven, yeah 
 (Heaven is over me) 
 Come on and set me free 
 Somehow my beginning stepped right in (Right in) 
 Then faith became my friend (My friend) 
 And now I can depend 
 On the voices of the wind 
 When it's sayin' (Sayin') 
 The storm is over 
 (The storm is over now) 
 And I can see the sunshine 
 (Somewhere beyond the clouds) 
 I can feel Heaven, yeah 
 (Heaven is over me) 
 Won't you come and set me free 
 Won't you set me free 
 The storm is over 
 (The storm is over now) 
 And I can see the sunshine 
 (Somewhere beyond the clouds) 
 I can feel Heaven, yeah 
 (Heaven is over me) 
 Won't you come and set me free 
 (Ey ey ey ey ey ey ey) 
 Won't you come and set me free 
 (Just like, If that guy can see the light, shine it!) 
 Somewhere beyond the clouds 
 (If that guy can see the light, shine it!) 
 Take it down, down 
 (If that guy can see the light, shine it!) 
 The cloudes movin, the sun shinin' 
 (If that guy can see the light, shine it!) 
 I made it, prayin' for a pot of gold 
 (The storm is over now) 
 I tell ya I could see the light 
 (Somewhere beyond the clouds) 
 I can feel Heaven over me 
 (Heaven is over me) 
 Come and set me free...
