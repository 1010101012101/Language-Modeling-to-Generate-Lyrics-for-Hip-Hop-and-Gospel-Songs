What's up baby

 What did I call you over here for 
 I wanna take you somewhere 
 Tempo slow, lights down low 
 Let me take you to a place 
 Where only love grooves go 
 Step into my territory 
 And let the vibes begin 
 Don't be afraid 
 Just let this love groove in 
 Let the passion lead you to a place beyond 
 Exploring my bedroom, having freaky fun 
 Tempo slow, lights down low 
 Let me take you to a place 
 Where only love grooves go 
 All the players go 
 All the gangstas go 
 Tempo slow, lights down low 
 Let me take you to a place 
 Where only love grooves go 
 Rules they are so simple, so very simple 
 As our bodies connect 
 And those juices start to flow 
 Makin' sweet love 'til the morning light 
 And satisfying love's appetite 
 Tempo slow, lights down low 
 Let me take you to a place 
 Where only love grooves go 
 Tempo slow, lights down low 
 Let me take you to a place 
 Where only love grooves go 
 Baby tell Daddy what it is you want 
 Come on and unravel those little secrets unknown 
 Time to taste what love has in store for me 
 So let's take a sip of this love groove chemistry 
 Tempo slow, lights down low 
 Let me take you to a place 
 Where only love grooves go 
 Tempo slow, lights down low 
 Let me take you to a place 
 Where only love grooves go 
 Tempo slow, lights down low 
 Let me take you to a place 
 Where only love grooves go
