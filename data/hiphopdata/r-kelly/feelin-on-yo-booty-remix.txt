Damn, This sound real familiar 
 This sound real familiar 
 [Chorus :] What remix is this? 
 Feeling on yo booty [repeat 4times] 
 [Verse1:] V.I.P. Wit all ma thugs 
 Henessey niggas at the club 
 Drop top V. rollin' on dubs 
 Chicken heads showin nothin' but love 
 So much booty (heads in the air like what the awh 
 D.J's say this mix is the cut 'cause we be on the flo like we some rugs 
 Come here girl (give daddy hug) 
 Don't play me (Like I'm one of these scubs) 
 Girl if you don't get yo ass over here and get yo ass in this tub 
 So much booty (see I ain't drunk but I'm real nice nigga high 
 Like a real kite y'all know this remix is real tight. 
 [Verse 2:] I gotta whole block of girl at ma crib 
 I'm over by the pool drinking Belvedear 
 Ain't no haters up in here 
 'Cause brought that thang down here 
 So much booty 
 That's all I see from the front to the rear 
 Socks and house shoes wit Polo gear 
 500 to the biggest booty in here 
 Come here girl (give daddy hug) 
 Don't Play me like I'm one of these scubs 
 Girl if you don't get yo ass over here and get yo ass in this tub 
 So much booty 
 We lookin' out from the hill now 
 Kelly makin' a kill now 
 What's that I wanna feel now 
 Radio stations, Radio stations, Radio stations, Radio stations 
 You're getting sleepy 
 Lady 
 D.J's in the, D.J's in the, D.J's in the, 
 D.J's in the bumpin in the club everywhere 
 Feelin' on yo booty, yo booty, 
 Yo booty, yo boo-ooh 
 Feelin' on yo booty, yo booty, yo booty, yo booty 
 Yo boocka boo-ooty, booty 
 Booga, booga, booga, booga, booga, 
 Booga, booga, booga, booga, booga, 
 Booga, booga, booga, booga-ooty, [laugh with it] booooooty.
