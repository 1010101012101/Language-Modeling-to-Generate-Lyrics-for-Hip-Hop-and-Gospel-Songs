Search for me, find me 4x 
 You keep searchin' 4x 
 I'm right here, I'm right here 
 I'm right here, baby 
 Love's in your face 
 I'll do anything to please you 
 Baby, tell me what to do 
 Let me get out those shoes 
 I'll be your slave if you want me to 
 Just give me the chance and I'll prove it babe 
 There's nobody else that knows how to do it babe 
 I'm on fire girl for you 
 Wanna burn down this room 
 Don't you run away from the truth 
 Whisper in my ear and tell me you feel it too 
 You keep searchin' 4x 
 I'm right here, I'm right here 
 I'm right here, baby 
 Love's in your face 
 It doesn't matter what it is
