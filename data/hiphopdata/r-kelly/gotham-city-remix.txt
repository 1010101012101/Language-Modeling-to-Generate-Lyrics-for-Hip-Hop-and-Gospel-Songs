Gotham City for the ghetto, ghetto 
 Gotham City for the ghetto, ghetto 
 Uh yo yo 
 Everybody's talking about the good old days 
 Everybody's talking about the good old days 
 Huh I remember when me and my brothers 
 We used to sit up on the porch in the summertime 
 And just talk about 
 Just making it you know what I'm saying being successful 
 Following up our dreams you know and I 
 I believe that's every kids dream 
 You know what I'm saying to rise and be somebody 
 But damn sometimes we just get caught up 
 I ain't got no money and I ain't got no friends 
 Looks like my world is coming to an end 
 No food on the table, no clothes on my back 
 No shoes on my feet and I just bearly got a used Cadillac 
 Now ain't that ghetto for ya 
 But somehow it's gotta change yeah 
 Ghetto for ya, so I took this remix 
 And rearranged Gotham City 
 City of love 
 A city of peace for everyone of us 
 'Cause we all need it, can't live without it 
 Gotham City for the ghetto yeah 
 Gotham City for the ghetto, that's what I'm talking 'bout 
 Ghetto fabulous, to a nigga health be hazardous 
 If you wanna test raffiness for the respect 
 S T R I N G S yes 
 Fuck the rest give me the best 
 Why should I have to settle for less 
 When I could push the V-12's with finesse 
 And all that mess 
 If you try to hold me back 
 Would I keep on struggling till I hit the sky 
 Even if you wanted to you can't deny 
 Gotta feed baby girl who would die 
 We keep talking about escalating 
 Well who's gonna go first 
 Guess I'll be the one to step up 
 If you don't follow me it would be the worst 
 Every time something goes down 
 Somebody's crying ghetto tears 
 Hope I'm not raining on your parade 
 But this is not what keeping it really is 
 Now ain't that ghetto for ya 
 But somehow it's gotta change yeah 
 Ghetto for ya, so I took this remix 
 And rearranged a Gotham City 
 City of love 
 A city of peace for everyone of us 
 'Cause we all need it, can't live without it 
 Gotham City for the ghetto yeah 
 Check it out 
 Now motherfucka wanna act surprised 
 'Cause you're afraid to change scared to rise 
 That's why you ass get left behind 
 Nigga got a sight, nigga got a mind 
 'Cause ain't nobody gonna stop the dream 
 Talk that shit, block my cream 
 Negativity you gotta let go 
 Heaven gotta see for the ghetto 
 We all need hey, hey, hey 
 Gotham City for the ghetto yeah 
 Calling on Heaven 
 Send your love down to the ghetto yeah 
 Talking about a land where oh yeah 
 Where there will be no more crying 
 No more crying now, oh yeah 
 A place where we can all just get along yeah 
 And children will sing the ghetto love songs 
 In a land where, city of love 
 In a land where, for every one of us
