This song goes out to my mother - The one I loved and the one I lost - When it comes down to thinking about what my mother's done for me, the love she's given me. - It makes it easy to do a song like this - So this ones for you mom I love 
 You 
 Early one Sunday morning 
 Breakfast was on the table 
 There was no time to eat 
 She said to me boy hurry to Sunday school 
 Filled with the long of glory 
 We learned the holy story 
 She'll always have her dreams 
 Despite the things 
 This troubled world can bring. 
 Oh Sadie don't you know we love you sweet Sadie 
 Place No one above you sweet Sadie 
 Well well well 
 Living in the past 
 Sometimes it seems so funny, no money can turn your life around 
 Sweeter than cotton candy 
 Stronger than papas' old Brandy 
 Always that needed smile 
 Once in awhile she would break down and cry 
 Sometimes she'd be so happy 
 Being with us and daddy 
 Standing the worst of times 
 Breaking the binds with just a simple song 
 Oh Sadie don't you know we love you sweet Sadie 
 Place No one above you sweet Sadie 
 Well well well 
 Living in the past 
 Sometimes it seems so funny, no money can turn your life around
