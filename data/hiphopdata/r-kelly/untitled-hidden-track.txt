Has gone, I'm still all alone 
 How could this be, you're not here with me 
 You never said goodbye, someone tell me why 
 Did you have to go and leave my world so cold? 
 Everyday I sit and ask myself 
 How did love slip away 
 Something whispers in my ear and says 
 That you are not alone, for I am here with you 
 Though you're far away, I am here to stay 
 But you are not alone, for I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart 
 But you are not alone 
 'Lone, 'lone, why, 'lone 
 Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry 
 Asking me to come and hold you in my arms 
 I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear 
 But first I need your hand then forever can begin 
 Everyday I sit and ask myself 
 How did love slip away 
 Something whispers in my ear and says 
 That you are not alone, for I am here with you 
 Though you're far away, I am here to stay 
 But you are not alone, for I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart 
 For you are not alone 
 Oh whisper three words, and I'll come runnin' 
 And I, and girl, you know that I'll be there, I'll be there 
 You are not alone, for I am here with you 
 Though you're far away, I am here to stay 
 You are not alone, for I am here with you 
 Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart 
 For you are not alone, for I am here with you 
 (You are not alone, I am here with you) 
 Though you're far away, I am here to stay 
 (Though you're far away, you and me) 
 For you are not alone, for I am here with you 
 (You are always in my heart) 
 Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
