Ooh, na na na (yo... yo body) yo' body, na na na (2x) 
 VERSE 1 
 Turn the lights down low, I'm ready to break it off 
 Since Computer Love, been wantin to set it off 
 Like a hotel room, I'm checkin' in to you 
 I'm diggin' like a shovel, all the things you do 
 Take a leap over the broom, it's how you makin' me feel 
 Come on in this room, and let's keep it real, you know 
 CHORUS 
 Half on a baby 
 All I need is your body next to me (saying ooh) 
 Ooh na na na na na (yo... yo body) Yo body na na na 
 Half on a baby (All I need) 
 All I need is your body next to me (I'm saying ooh) 
 Ooh na na na na na (yo... yo body) Yo body na na na 
 VERSE 2 
 Now tell me what the deal is, are you ready to bump 
 It's gonna take a lifetime, to give you all of this love 
 So baby open up, and get ready to receive 
 A miracle of love, gettin' down with me 
 Like a baseball field, wanna hit a home run 
 Me and you get together babe, and raise a litlle one

 Half on a baby (All I need) 
 All I need is your body next to me (saying ooh)

 VERSE 3 
 Set it off in a six, baby that'll be cool 
 Take a trip downtown, between me and you 
 Trippin' on Perionn, conversation like, what? 
 Not afraid to go down, won't you open up 
 After 9 to 5, you deserve some 12 
 Makin' future plans, to be where I dwell 
 CHORUS 
 Half on a baby (All I need) 
 All I need is your body next to me (I'm saying ooh) 
 Ooh na na na na na (yo... yo body) (whoa) Yo body na na na
