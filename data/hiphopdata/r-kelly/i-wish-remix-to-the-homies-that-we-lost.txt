Yo what up, my nigga 
 You know I was in the hood 
 I just thought I'd stop by 
 Holler at you for a minute 
 Pour out a little liquor or something 
 Nigga, we done been through a lot of shit together 
 From running these streets to being down for whatever 
 And now that you're gone I got a whole lot of shit to tell you 
 Things I should've said way back when we was younger 
 Remember when we used to roll hand in hand 
 And now I'm tripping on how I really miss you, man 
 And remember when you and me would say 
 We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay 
 It's all good now (My nigga) 
 We out the hood now 
 We had the same ideas, but not the same careers 
 We shared the same old laugh, and not the same tears 
 You were my homie, my sconey, my Roni 
 My nigga and never placed no bitch before me 
 Man, I swear to God I love you for that shit 
 Why'd you have to get hit 
 Where was I, what time was it 
 You were supposed to get older with me 
 On stage, hands on shoulders with me 
 Copping them Range Rovers with me 
 Sitting on thangs and smoking trees 
 And if it wasn't for the will that God had made 
 I'd turn back the hands of time and take your place 
 Sitting here sipping on this Hennessy 
 Just thinking about how much you meant to me (My nigga) 
 Even when you're gone you will always be my nigga 
 When you went home I'm still missing you, my nigga 
 I'm feeling like the timing was wrong, my nigga 
 I know you're smiling down saying carry on, my nigga 
 Sometimes my nights can get long, my nigga 
 Sometimes I feel God did me wrong, my nigga 
 So I had to write a song, my nigga 
 Just to let you know that you're still my nigga 
 I wish, I wish, I wish (Oh I) 
 I wish, I wish, I wish 
 Little son is looking at me like, "Where is my daddy?" 
 And your 13-year old daughter is mad 'cause she understands 
 Promised your mama I'd take care of the family 
 But she's so hurt, she turns away my helping hands 
 Damn, I wish your ass was here, my nigga 
 To grow that gray beard and smoke that cigar, my nigga 
 And we would talk about you getting up out this game 
 And you would tell me how it keeps calling you name 
 (We used to ride-ride-ride) 
 Never afraid to (Die-die-die) 
 But sometimes we (Cry-cry-cry) 
 Asking the Lord (Why-why-why) 
 They're tearing down these projects 
 We were homies for like 20 thug years 
 Sat in church and cried the same thug tears 
 You remember when Vibe World Premier 
 How we used to share the same old gear 
 And remember when you and me would say 
 We'd get up out this hood and everything would be okay 
 (It's all good now) My nigga 
 We out the hood now 
 It's so easy for folks to say, "Rob, just live on" 
 When I'm dying every second that you're gone 
 Nevertheless I try my best to be strong 
 Hoping you said your prayers before you went on home 
 When we stood on these blocks and just shot the breeze 
 We'd slapbox dead in the middle of streets 
 And if a fight broke out, you would take up for me 
 You're all I have left of these ghetto memories 
 I wish, I wish, I wish (Oh I) 
 I wish, I wish, I wish 
 Uh, uh, yo dog, I can't explain how I miss you 
 We stayed together, copping cane, poppin' pistols 
 I miss you most 
 Putting the doo rag over your bean head 
 Even out the hood on the scene you brag (whoa) 
 Coming up off the fiends for bags 
 Running up out the cleaners, drag 
 You was the closest nigga I had 
 Look how we stayed aces 
 Hustled, made big faces 
 I wish we could trade places 
 Fuck giving you ice, I'd rather give you life 
 And the things that I had, I'd give you twice (Oh yeah) 
 So what the deal, my nigga, I know you holding it down 
 If you could see me you would say I'm talking soft right now 
 But it's hard for me to say when I'ma see you again 
 And I know it's fucked up, I gotta talk through this pen 
 But you died for the love of the dough 
 The love of the block, 16 you was running the spot 
 Boy, your mama used to hate how we stood on the curb 
 Hanging with wild thug niggas, smoking the herb 
 I'm gonna keep pouring this liquor and that's my word 
 This here is for my niggas that be flipping them birds 
 Word up! 
 Even though you know you will always be my nigga 
 (Whoa... whoa... oh... oh) 
 Even though you're gone you will also be my nigga 
 I'm feeling like the time when I'm high, my nigga 
 I'm feeling like the time 
 I'm strung out, saying "Radio, please don't take the nigga out 
 This song" 
 Let it play on, play on, play on, play on... 
 So I had to write this song, my nigga 
 Just to let you know that you're still my nigga
