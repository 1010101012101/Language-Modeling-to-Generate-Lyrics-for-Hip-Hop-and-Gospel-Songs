You remind me of something 
 I just can't think what it is 
 You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it 
 Something like my sounds, I wanna pump it 
 Girl, you look just like my cars, I wanna wax it 
 And something like my bank account, I wanna spend it 
 It's something about your love that's got me going crazy 
 Baby, you know I want you real bad 
 And girl, I really like your freaky style 
 How can I be down with you? 
 So get a little closer to my ride, I wanna get to know you, lady 
 And hip me up on how to get inside you, listen pretty baby 
 I wanna roll it, roll it, roll it, is all I wanna do for you, baby 
 Girl, it's something kind of sexy goin' on about you 
 You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it 
 Something like my sounds, I wanna pump it 
 Girl, you look just like my cars, I wanna wax it 
 And something like my bank account, I wanna spend it 
 Now I would like to take you for a ride 
 Girl, you know we'll have so much fun 
 And give you everything your body needs 
 Satisfaction guaranteed 
 So pull up to my bumper and 
 Let the system sound 
 Girl, I betcha I can drive you crazy 
 And let me be the one to drop you off 
 Babe, listen to me 
 I wanna roll it, roll it, roll it is all 
 I wanna do for you, baby 
 Girl, it's something kind of sexy 
 Goin' on about you 
 You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it 
 Something like my sounds, I wanna pump it 
 Girl, you look just like my cars, I wanna wax it 
 And something like my bank account, I wanna spend it
