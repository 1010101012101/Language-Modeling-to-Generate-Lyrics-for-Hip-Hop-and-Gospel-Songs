Hey 
 Hey 
 Ladies and gentleman the champ is here 
 The champ is here 
 The champ is here 
 Get your mutha fuckin' hands in the air 
 (Ooh) 
 The champ is here 
 The champ is here 
 The champ is here 
 You can hate me I don't care 
 All y'all wanna pile on me 
 Make it hard for me to breathe 
 Throw sand in my eyes 
 And make it hard for me to see 
 Out of breath 
 Can't see 
 Still hard to defeat 
 The history that I make 
 Impossible to repeat 
 Spread rumors 
 Point fingers 
 Throw stones 
 Judge me 
 Hate me 
 Love me 
 Hug me 
 Curse me 
 Whatever 
 'Cause y'all fuckin' opinions don't feed me 
 I'm clever 
 And nothin' know that the industry needs me 
 (Second round!) 
 I'm opposite of the demon that faces me 
 I've 
 Been through hell 
 Live in the belly of the beast 
 i 
 Confess my sins 
 But still didn't find peace 
 But 
 Like mj and five 
 I will six peak 
 (Third round!) 
 I write music for hood first 
 'Cause that's where I'm from 
 That's why the hood is always first 
 To help me overcome 
 (Fifth round!) 
 When I'm down some o' y'all cats act so strange 
 And when I'm up same cats wonder why I act so strange 
 (Sixth round) 
 Kells ain't change 
 Please you bitches is so lame 
 Somethin' ain't y'all fault 
 Then y'all so quick to blame 
 That's why I got number one on the back o' my range 
 Y'all cats is full playin' 
 I'm pregnant by the game 
 (Seventh round!) 
 Some would like to see me ball and chain 
 But I'm a child of god 
 So my destiny's ordained 
 (Eighth round!) 
 Undisputed is the title I claim 
 'Bout to shoot the world up with this lyrical cocaine 
 (Ninth round!) 
 The place is packed 
 The bell rings 
 I'm about to bring the pain 
 Left jab 
 Right hook 
 Shuttin' down yo' brain 
 (Tenth round!) 
 I could be surrounded by lions in the midst of the jungle 
 And still I'm a rumble young man rumble 
 Ladies and gentlemen 
 (Eleventh round!) 
 The champ is here 
 The champ is here 
 Get your mutha fuckin' hands in the air 
 (Get your mutha fuckin' hands in the air) 
 (Ooh) 
 The champ is here 
 The champ is here 
 The champ is here 
 You can hate me I don't care
