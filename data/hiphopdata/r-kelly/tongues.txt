 January boy (talking) 
 Hail mary full of grace 
 Hail mary full of grace 
 Hail mary full of grace 
 I swear that's what she said 
 Shawty looking at me she's a flirt an all night creeper 
 Let her know I put in works but there's something I gotta teach you 
 Bust it open bring it back I be ready to attack 
 I got an automatic weapon it go pa-pa-pa-pa-plat 
 She's a wifey in the streets sweeted like a dove 
 Me and her admission now she's rolling with a thug 
 She know that I keep her sprung and you know where I'm from 
 It's that chi-town boy and I got these honeys speaking in tongues 
 (Chores) 
 In tongues 
 In tongues 
 In tongues 
 I got these honeys speaking in tongues 
 (Ludacris) 
 (Ha ha) 
 She be like ludacris ta-da-ta don't nobody give it to me like you do 
 I cast a spell on them th-they be thinking I'm doing voodoo 
 Can't understand the words you saying (nope) you need a translator 
 I aim before I shot then I assassinator 
 She be catching that holy ghost she has a lost for words 
 She said she really wanna wet the fabric so I'm a soften her 
 Was a good girl when I met her and she was so pure 
 Now I got her in the back room talking about "imna-a-ring-a-qur" 
 That's what you get when you messing with the boys in the hood that's from the south 
 We be like "do you understand the words that's coming outta my mouth" 
 She got just what she wanted and she knows I'm hood I guess it's why it seems 
 (Chores) 
 I got these honeys speaking in tongues 
 In tongues 
 In tongues 
 In tongues 
 I got them now speaking in tongues 
 (R. kelly) 
 Six days a week get off on a Sunday come over late at night then I eat it like a sundae 
 She know that I'm a heavyweight more money then collection plate 
 She's tiding, she's sliding on me like a tidal wave 
 Hey-ay I mean shawty so fine you need to pray for me 
 She yelling but I don't know what she saying to me 
 She speaking languages that I ain't never heard call her dirty diana mane 
 The way she make it jerk 
 She know that I keep her sprung and you know where I'm from 
 It's that chi-town boy and I got these honeys speaking in tongues 
 (Chores) 
 In tongues 
 In tongues 
 In tongues 
 I got them now speaking in tongues 
 Shawty what you saying (4x)
