Stupid, look at you now, you screwed all up, 
 You kept coming live and run out of luck 
 You thought you were strong, thought you were so tough. 
 And now all you've got I s your pride to hold! 
 And that's not enough! 
 Never seen this kind of frame, this change I s so strange, 
 Do I feel your absence I s like ... 
 Girl I wanna feel again! 
 Don't wanna be here doing dishes, dishes, doing dishes! 
 Don't wanna be here doing dishes, dishes, doing dishes! 
 Don't wanna be, no! 
 S.o.s, s.o.s! call I n! 
 S.o.s, s.o.s! call I n! 
 She gave you the world and you threw I t away, 
 She was your girl and you were engaged, 
 ...Your holiday, ... 
 I've been hit by a truck, and I 'm bleeding I nside, 
 The cure I s too far away and I 'm about to die! 
 Never seen this kind of... so strange, 
 I feel your absence, I t's like a... 
 Girl, I wanna feel again! 
 Don't wanna be here doing dishes, dishes, doing dishes! 
 Don't wanna be here doing dishes, dishes, doing dishes! 
 Don't wanna be, no! 
 Don't wanna be here doing dishes, dishes, doing dishes! 
 I don't wanna be, no! 
 By the time the sun will rise again, I 'm hoping you will be with me! 
 'Cause I don't wanna, I don't wanna die without you 
 And I don't wanna live here without you! 
 Don't wanna be here doing dishes, dishes, doing dishes! 
 Don't wanna be here doing dishes, dishes, doing dishes! 
 Don't wanna be here doing dishes, dishes, doing dishes! 
 Don't wanna be here doing dishes, dishes, doing dishes!
