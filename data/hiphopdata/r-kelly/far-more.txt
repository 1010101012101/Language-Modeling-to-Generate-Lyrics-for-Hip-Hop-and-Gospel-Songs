Mansions, Hills, and Acres 
 Women, Drinks, and Caterers 
 I will toast intil the Break of Dawn 
 Swimming Pools and Strippers 
 Conversation, Six figures 
 Never crossed my mind to call home... 
 There's a note on the bathroom mirror 
 Telling me that you had enough 
 It took you leavin' me for my blind eyes to see 
 That you mean 
 (Far more) 
 Than this planet to me 
 (Far more) 
 Than the air I breath 
 (Far more) 
 From here to overseas 
 (Far more) 
 Girl, you're all I need 
 (Far more) 
 Than the mountains and tree 
 (Far more) 
 You mean more than the birds and bees 
 (Far more) 
 Honey take it from me 
 (Far more) 
 You are all I need 
 Hanging out with friends 
 Never calling to check in 
 Neglecting you in every way. 
 Taking the home front for granted 
 What was straight now is slanted 
 And I don't know what to do about this letter 
 There's a note on the bathroom mirror 
 Telling me that you had enough 
 It took you leavin' me for my blind eyes to see 
 That you mean 
 (Far more) 
 More than this planet to me 
 (Far more) 
 More than the air I breath 
 (Far more) 
 From here to overseas 
 (Far more) 
 Girl, you're all I need 
 (Far more) 
 Than the mountains and tree 
 (Far more) 
 Than the birds and bees 
 (Far more) 
 Honey take it from me 
 (Far more) 
 You are all I need 
 Shoo-wop, shoo-wop 
 Skiddle-ee bee bop 
 Hip hop 
 Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, 
 Skiddle-ee, bee bop 
 Hip hop 
 Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, 
 Skiddle-ee, bee bop 
 Hip hop 
 Far more, far more 
 Shoo-wop, shoo-wop 
 Skiddle-ee bee bop 
 Hip hop 
 Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, 
 Skiddle-ee, bee bop 
 Hip hop 
 Shoo-wop, shoo-wop, 
 Skiddle-ee, bee bop 
 Hip hop 
 Far more to me... 
 There's a note on the bathroom mirror

 (Far more) 
 I've realized girl 
 (Far more) 
 Just what it is I had at home 
 (Far more) 
 Oh, baby you mean far more 
 (Far more) 
 Than this planet to me 
 (Far more) 
 Than this air I breathe 
 (Far more) 
 Nothing can compare 
 (Far more) 
 To your love for me 
 (Far more) 
 To your love for me 
 (Far more) 
 To your love for me 
 (Far more) 
 To your love for me
