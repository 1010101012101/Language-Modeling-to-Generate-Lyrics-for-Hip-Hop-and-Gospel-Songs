Close your eyes 
 Now relax your mind 
 Now I want you to picture yourself far far away 
 (All your thoughts aside 'cause we're about to take a ride) 
 And I don't want you to have a care in the world right now 
 It's just you and me 
 In this moment... quiet 
 Listen 
 Baby take your mind into a zone 
 Imagine that we all alone 
 Two ways are off and our friends are gone 
 Now picture you and me getting it on 
 Take my hand and come with me 
 Let's indulge in fantasies 
 Cast your cares and worries 
 And slowly fall into this ecstasy 
 I'm gonna rub your body, so baby just relax 
 You've been pouring out your loving, and now it's time to pour it back 
 Imagine that 
 (Imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that) 
 All night long me stroking your body 
 Imagine that 
 (Imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that) 
 Whipped cream and strawberries know what I mean 
 (Imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that) 
 Candles and oils surrounding the bed 
 (Imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that) 
 And me kissing your body from feet to head 
 Imagine that 
 We don't have to talk 
 Lay your body here and watch my fingers walk 
 Take a second and imagine the opportunity 
 You and me sharing sexual energy 
 Now girl just mediate on you being in this chair 
 Then close your eyes and act like we not even here 
 Girl 
 I'm gonna rub your body, so baby just relax 
 You've been pouring out your loving, and now it's time to pour it back 
 Imagine 
 (Imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that) 
 Me stroking your body 
 Imagine that 
 (Imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that) 
 Strawberries and whipped cream know what I mean 
 (Imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that) 
 Candles and oils surrounding the bed 
 (Imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that) 
 Me kissing you from feet to head 
 Yeah 
 Baby 
 Imagine 
 (Imagine that imagine that imagine that [Baby] imagine imagine that) 
 That I'm stroking your body 
 Imagine that 
 (Imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that) 
 Strawberries and whipped cream imagine that 
 Imagine that 
 (Imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that) 
 Oh baby candles and oils surrounding the bed 
 (Imagine that imagine that imagine that imagine imagine that) 
 Imagine I'm taking off my clothes baby 
 Hey 
 Do it baby 
 Take off all your clothes baby 
 (Imagine that) 
 Hey 
 Cause you owe me baby 
 And I want you baby 
 So let it take control 
 Hey 
 Baby let it take control 
 Oh 
 Imagine that, I'm kissing you 
 From feet to head 
 It's you and me in the bed 
 Screaming baby 
 Say my name say my name say my name say my name say my name 
 Oh
