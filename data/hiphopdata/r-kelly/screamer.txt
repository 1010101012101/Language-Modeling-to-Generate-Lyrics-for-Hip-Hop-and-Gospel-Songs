Slowly goin' in hand on her mouth 
 Bout to have sex while it's people in my house 
 She ain't really caring nothin' 'bout the party 
 Tryin' to keep her calm but she so naughty 
 Hand on her shoulder while I'm rollin' it 
 Lookin' in the mirror while I'm stroking it 
 Then she pull away and I don't get it 
 She ready I can tell the way she holdin' it 
 O except one thing she likes lil mama don't know how to act when I'm hittin from the back (yeah) 
 'Cause she's moanin loud and she scracthin me 
 She's goin' wild and she's grabbin me 
 About to make the bed break we rockin' it break we pushin it 
 I know they're hearin it 
 But she don't want me to take it out keep goin' 
 And I don't really wanna take it out 
 She says there's somethin' freaky about the other people bein on the other side of the door shawty is a screamer 
 Shawty is a screamer 
 Breathe breathe hit it rest 
 Breathe breathe hit it rest 
 Pullin on her hair grabbin her neck 
 She give me full control the up most respect 
 And our love in the air our love in the air 
 She's about to make me forget that I'm a playa 
 She yank me I spank her she say spank me more 
 I spank her again and now we all on the floor floor floor 
 Now I'm goin' lower lower lower 
 Then she turned over 
 She say she never had a man do it like that 
 I say I never heard somebody moanin like that 
 'Cause she's bitin her lips and makin' faces 
 As I ram her hips we goin' crazy 
 About to make the bed break we rockin' it break we pushin it 
 I know they're hearin it 
 But she don't want me to take it out keep goin' 
 And I don't really wanna take it out 
 She says there's somethin' freaky about the other people bein on the other side of the door shawty is a screamer
