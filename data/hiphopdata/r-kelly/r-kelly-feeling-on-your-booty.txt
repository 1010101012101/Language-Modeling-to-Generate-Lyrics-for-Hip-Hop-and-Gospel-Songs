This is my song for real, no doubt 
 See the DJ's makin' me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to dance floor, we begin to dance slow 
 You put your arms around me, I'm feelin' on yo booty 
 Hey pretty mama, how you doin' ? 
 Said, I'm just in town for the weekend 
 Lookin' for a lil trouble to get into 
 Baby, tell me whatcha drinkin' and I got you, ooh 
 Playaz wanna play, ballaz wanna ball 
 Rollaz wanna roll but I'm takin' all, after I dance 
 This is my song for real, no doubt 
 See the DJ's makin' me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to dance floor, we begin to dance slow 
 You put your arms around me, I'm feelin' on yo booty 
 This is my song for real, no doubt 
 See the DJ's makin' me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to dance floor, we begin to dance slow 
 You put your arms around me, I'm feelin' on yo booty 
 Now, yo body's got me feelin' like spendin' 
 With a back room, I could come to live in 
 And yo hair weave's lookin' kinda purty 
 The way you back it up on me, baby, Lord, have mercy 
 Playaz wanna play, ballaz wanna ball 
 Rollaz wanna roll but I'm takin' all after I dance, yeah 
 This is my song for real, no doubt 
 See the DJ's makin' me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to dance floor, we begin to dance slow 
 You put your arms around me, I'm feelin' on yo booty 
 This is my song for real, no doubt 
 See the DJ's makin' me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to dance floor, we begin to dance slow 
 You put your arms around me, I'm feelin' on yo booty 
 If it's yo birthday then put yo hands up 
 You wanna get drunk? Then put yo hands up 
 And if you got some cash, put yo hands up 
 And your own job, put yo hands up 
 (Playaz wanna play) 
 Playaz wanna play, ballaz wanna ball 
 Rollaz wanna roll 
 Playaz wanna play, ballaz wanna ball 
 Rollaz wanna roll but I'm takin' all after I dance, oh yeah 
 This is my song for real, no doubt 
 See the DJ's makin' me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to dance floor, we begin to dance slow 
 You put your arms around me, I'm feelin' on yo booty

 As I walk you to dance floor, we begin to dance slow 
 You put your arms around me, I'm feelin' on yo booty 
 This is my song for real, no doubt 
 See the DJ's makin' me feel thugged out 
 As I walk you to dance floor, we begin to dance slow 
 You put your arms around me, I'm feelin' on yo booty 
 This is my song for real, no doubt
