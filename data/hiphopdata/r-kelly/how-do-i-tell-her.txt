How do I tell her that I'm goin' away 
 When I know that she'll be begging me to stay 
 And how do I tell her, that the time has come to part 
 When she's... she's gonna take it so hard 
 I don't wanna break her heart 
 I don't wanna see her cry no 
 'Cause I promised her forever 
 That I'd be by her side so 
 How do I tell her, How do I tell her tell her tell her 
 Goodbye... (oh yeah) 
 How do I tell her, that my path has gone and changed 
 When I know that her heart won't be able to stand the pain 
 (Oh no) 
 And How do I tell her that I'm movig on with my life 
 When she's just gonna break down and die 
 I don't wanna break her heart no 
 I don't wanna see her cry no 
 When I promised the girl forever 
 I'd be by her side so 
 So how do I tell her tell her tell her 
 Goodbye... (oh yeah) whoa 
 Listen, she's been forever faithful, honest, and true 
 Yes she has 
 My God this has gotta be the worst thing that I ever had to do 
 How How How How How How 
 How do I tell her,(oh oh) that the time has come to part 
 When I know that she's gonna take it so very hard (yes she is)
