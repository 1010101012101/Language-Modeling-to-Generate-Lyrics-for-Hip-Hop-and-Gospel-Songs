Ooh, oh my darling 
 Oh my love yeah 
 Ooh oh oh, yeah yeah 
 Staring at the Christmas tree 
 Thinking about having a Christmas party 
 We're in the club and haven't been playing 
 Everybody's so in love with everybody 
 I'll sing a song friends will tag along 
 Oh the mood is perfect like it's supposed to be 
 La la la la la 
 So have no fear 
 Christmas spirit's here 
 I'm gonna dress up, gonna celebrate this year 
 Oh this Christmas, I'll be stepping 
 Stepping, stepping, stepping 
 Oh this Christmas, I'll be grooving 
 Grooving, grooving, grooving 
 Oh there's nothing better than 
 Friends and dfamily getting together 
 Opn this night we're celebrating love 
 There's never anything wrong 
 With people getting along 
 Doesn't matter what the color 
 I'll sing a song friends and will tag along 
 Oh the mood is perfect just like it's supposed to be 
 La la la la la 
 So have no fear 
 Christmas spirit's here 
 I'm gonna dress up, gonna celebrate this year 
 Oh this Christmas, I'll be stepping 
 Stepping, stepping, stepping 
 Oh this Christmas, I'll be grooving 
 Grooving, grooving, grooving

 I can see couples under mistletoe 
 There's so many happy faces on the dance floor 
 Love is a universal language we all know 
 Oh this Christmas, I'll be stepping 
 Stepping, stepping, stepping

 Grooving, grooving, grooving
