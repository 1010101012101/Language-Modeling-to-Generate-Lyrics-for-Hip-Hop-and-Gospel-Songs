(First of all 
 If you ain't got no drink in your hand 
 You ain't got no shot in your hand and no money in your pocket 
 Get the hell outta here!) 
 (Uh uh, hey hey hey hey) 
 Hey lil' mama

 All on the floor 
 Doin' you mama 
 Got the dance down 
 Do it like a pro 
 Handle that patron 
 But you want a lil' mo' 
 The way you dancin on your girlfriend off in here 
 Got me wonderin' if you got a man off in here 
 The way you turn around and make a drop off in here 
 Make a playa' want to get his rocks off in here (Hold up) 
 Wait a damn minute 
 Bend it over now lemme put Kells in it 
 Shots at the bar, got my head so spinnin'(Whoa whoa whoa spinnin')
