Who da fuck can stop us niggas, it's gangsta niggas 
 It's gangsta! woo! it's gangsta nigga! 
 All g-g-gangsta nigga, uh! 
 Green light - go go, go-go-go, go 
 Go go, go-go-go, go 
 You got the green light to drag your motherfuckin' mink 
 Green light - go go, go-go-go, go 
 Throw your pinkie ring high in the motherfuckin' air 
 Go go, go-go-go, go 
 Drop your top, c'mon! 
 Now I done told y'all niggas once before 
 Y'all don't know who you fuckin' wit' 
 Y'all gon' fuck around and make me come up out this music biz (don't make me...) 
 This just a record deal, y'all motherfuckers been on some shit 
 Bite my style, tryin' to get rich, so I decided to flip my shit 
 Bene-fit me like a tight outfit, like Mr. Biggs about to have a fit 
 It's, a-bout, to, be, some, shit (please believe it) 
 See vin-dawg, and dre-shal, got a nigga real open y'all 
 I see haters peepin' me, lookin' hard like a pu-ssy 
 Same fight, different round; same circus, different clown 
 Same pussy, different town; assholes how you like me now? 
 Kel' and jigga, the best of both niggas 
 Put two heads together, mean mo' figures (ha) 
 Word to Tigger, put me off up in the "bassment" 
 With the rest of the rap niggas, watch ratings get bigger 
 I'm a pimp of this music, the tracks be my hoes 
 Sisqo, don't make me kick you out like devoe 
 Haters left, players right... green light 
 Go go, go-go-go, go 
 You have the green light to be as pimp as you want to 
 Go go, go-go-go, go 
 Green light - go go, go-go-go, go 
 Go go, go-go-go, go 
 Green light - go go, go-go-go, go 
 Go go, go-go-go, go 
 Green light - go go, go-go-go, go 
 Oh dis gangsta! 
 Go go, go-go-go, go 
 It's so motherfuckin' gangsta! 
 Psycho, like no, bitch-ass niggas 
 Don't wanna see the R.O.C. so you creep low 
 Shoot from the line like a free throw 
 With this 'nali of mine like a pi-co 
 Leave niggas far behind like a cheap hoe 
 On my grind every time that you see hov' 
 Yeah I got it, come and get it, green light go (go) 
 Red dot I stop ya, yellow niggas move slow 
 Red dot I got 'em, tell that nigga move slow 
 Head shots pop 'em when I let the uz' go 
 He done told fool... 
 Done think done lockin' when a gun smokin' 
 Tell done I been gun-totin' 
 He don't know he facin' death 
 Hockey mask on Jason's step 
 Don't make me pop past your Raisinette 
 You niggas cow-ass 
 You bullshit, I pull shit, and keep a full clip 
 Go go, go-go-go, go 
 Go go, go-go-go, go 
 Green light - go go, go-go-go, go 
 Go go, go-go-go, go 
 Green light - go go, go-go-go, go 
 Go go, go-go-go, go 
 Green light - go go, go-go-go, go 
 Go go, go-go-go, go
