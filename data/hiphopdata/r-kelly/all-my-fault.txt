Nowhere to hide from the truth 
 Cannot run from what I did to you 
 There's nowhere for me to point the blame 
 I did what I did and I'm so ashamed 
 That's my bad (I accuse myself) 
 That's my bad (for what has happened here) 
 That's my bad 
 It takes a man that's strong to admit he's wrong 
 So I'm standing here to let you know... 
 It's all my fault (repeat 4 times) 
 No longer will I act like you caused all of this 
 Won't turn around the truth no more I made this mess 
 Oh you deserve better than what I've shown you 
 I pray for the chance to make it all up to you 
 That's my bad (I accuse myself) 
 That's my bad (for what has happened here) 
 That's my bad 
 It takes a man that's strong to admit he's wrong 
 And so I'm standing here to let you know... 
 That it's all my fault (repeat 4 times) 
 First of all you're not the one who's been untrue 
 Second of all, you deserve someone who will be good to you 
 Third of all, the last thing you need is to raise a man 
 Fourth of all I realize without you I'm lost 
 Firth, tired of lying to that mirror on the wall 
 All of my fingers and I still can't count my flaws 
 You put your heart right in my hands and I dropped the ball 
 And it's all my fault 
 It's all my fault 
 Said it's all my fault 
 It's all my fault (I did it to myself) 
 Said it's all my fault 
 See I made my bed 
 And now I gotta lay in it 
 And there's no one else to blame but me
