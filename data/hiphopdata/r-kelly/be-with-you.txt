Baby, I'm sorry 
 Idk what happened I 
 Somewhere down the line I lost my head 
 I did 
 I've been hanging with my niggas drinking on that hard liquor 
 Had a song out baby some how my head got bigger 
 Been traveling around the world 
 2 of us's in jet planes 
 On major tours interviews everybody know my name 
 I was on every magazine cover 
 Check billboards all the others 
 Any awards I would get 
 Girl you name it and I did it 
 Just got back from out of town 
 And you're screaming out no more 
 Cars outside you got your clothes 
 And then you walk up out the door 
 I could give a dam* about a hit 
 'Cause I only wanna be with you 
 And if my job means there is no more us then I quit 
 'Cause I only wanna be with you 
 So take me off the radio no more going to the studio 
 Cause none of the ish is worth losing you naw naw 
 No more hanging with the thugs baby they can have these clubs 
 I don't wanna live this good life without you 
 I've been walking around the house bossing like I'm a super store 
 Throwing my weight, making demands and acting like I'm God 
 I've been fronting (frontin) stunting 9stuntin) 
 Too busy to hear you crying out when you was tryna tell me something 
 Going coast to coast show to show Charlie always on the go 
 Always got something to do if ain't rehearsal it's a video show 
 Just got back from out of town 
 And you're screaming out no more 
 Cars outside you got your clothes 
 And then you walk up out the door 
 I could give a dam* about a hit 
 'Cause I only wanna be with you 
 And if my job means there is no more us then I quit 
 'Cause I only wanna be with you 
 So take me off the radio no more going to the studio 
 Cause none of the ish is worth losing you naw naw 
 No more hanging with the thugs baby they can have these clubs 
 I don't wanna live this good life without you 
 Everything I have girl everything I own 
 All my cars all my clothes everyone of my homes 
 Ill strike a match baby set it all on fire 
 Before I lose you girl I will retire 
 I could give a dam* about a hit 
 'Cause I only wanna be with you 
 And if my job means there is no more us then I quit 
 'Cause I only wanna be with you 
 So take me off the radio no more going to the studio 
 Cause none of the ish is worth losing you naw naw 
 I could give a dam* about a hit 
 'Cause I only wanna be with you 
 And if my job means there is no more us then I quit 
 'Cause I only wanna be with you
