Rockland 
 In my life 
 Uh, Track Masters 
 You're all I need in my life 
 Make money 
 You're all I need in my life 
 Duece, duece 
 You're all I need in my life 
 Uh huh, yo, yo, yo, yo 
 I remember in the days 
 Y'all niggas talking all that shit about keepin' it real 
 But when it comes to this game I'mma play the field 
 Rockland had loot before we signed the deal 
 Haters get in the way and catch the sky like Seal 
 We used to use the streets for the football field 
 In church free lunch was our only meal 
 But now we push whips with Lorenzo wheels 
 Living it up in Beverly Hills 
 You know 9 to 5 was only temporary 
 Now the ladies wanna find Tone in a hurry 
 Got 'em hittin' notes that Mariah couldn't carry 
 All you player haters going down like Mary 
 Cop the Rolls Royce a player with a choice 
 Ladies stay moist from the sound of my voice 
 The lady killers pass the keys to our villas 
 Rockland, Track Masters top billers
