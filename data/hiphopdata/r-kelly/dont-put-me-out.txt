Baby now I realize 
 All of those times I told you I loved you 
 I just didn't show it 
 I'm sorry 
 Don't put me out 
 Don't put me out 
 Don't put me out 
 Don't put me out 
 Don't put me out 
 Don't put me out 
 Don't put me out 
 Don't put me out 
 Don't put me out 
 Don't put me out 
 I remember when you said to me 
 Don't talk about it be about it 
 I should have felt you when you said 
 To me that you were all alone 
 I act like I was doin' a favor 
 For you 'cause you were wit me 
 Something let me thinking that whatever happens 
 This would be my home 
 But I was wrong (I was wrong) 
 How could I have been so low 
 (How could I have been so low) 
 I wrote a song all about it 
 (Took a pen and wrote a song) 
 Wanna hear it, here it go, from now on
