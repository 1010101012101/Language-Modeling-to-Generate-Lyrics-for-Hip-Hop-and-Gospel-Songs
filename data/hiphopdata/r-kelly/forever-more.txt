Baby, I've just been sitting here thinking, how blessed I am to have someone like you in my life and I'm so excited so so excited about being with you for the rest of my life Listen 
 Looking at all this land, Damn I use to be alonely man, 
 Could never understand, Why I had no one to take my hand. 
 But then the weather changed Mother-nature brought the sun my way. 
 Now girl you're who I am and I have you for the rest of my days... 
 How the sun comes up in the early morning time, 
 Girl I vow to be forever loving you rain or shine, 
 How the moon takes us on this so romantic glow 
 I'll be lovin' you forever more... ooh oh yeah 
 Now I used to think that I would never, have a serious relationship, always praying for that one to come along and give me what I miss, but now those thoughts are no more, every since you came into my life, it's like heaven opened up its doors, showered down on me the perfect wife... ooh oh
