I know, 
 I've read all the articles 
 Seen all the photographs 
 Pictures of you and me in the magazines. 
 I did all the interviews and not once did I mention you 
 At the billboards, walk right by you 
 I didn't wanna make a scean 
 Because we agreed to keep it on the (HUSH) 
 Don't want everybody knowing about (US) 
 And I vowel that forever I'll keep my word baby 
 But I'm telling you know this secret is drivin' me crazy 
 And I'm tired of creepin' around with YOU 
 Girl I wanna be with YOU 
 Tell me what the hell are we gunna do 
 I'm like oh ooh oh ooh 
 Baby, we can't let the industry know 
 Because our cover will be blown 
 If anybody hears or so happens to see, 
 Girl you got your career and I got family 
 And girl that's why 
 We can't let the industry know 
 Because our cover will be blown 
 Don't want it to be blown 
 Gotta keep it on the low 
 Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobdy 
 Girl we can't let the indusrty know 
 Bet you wanna know who I'm talkin' bout 
 Bet you wanna know who I'm thinkin' bout 
 Wait, said you'd be my shelter in the midst fo stormy weather 
 Texts of you tellin' me you want my ?????? 
 Girl I just don't know 
 What to do anymore 
 You and me on the QT 
 Its killin' me slow 
 And even though I'm a litter younger than you it's okay 
 And I'm starting to feel that if people found out its okay 
 But then I see you up in the Slums 
 With nothing on, up in a video 
 I was so pissed that I jumped right up and went straight to the studio 
 Because we agreed to keep it on the (HUSH) 
 Don't want everybody knowing about (US) 
 And I vowel that forever I'll keep my word baby 
 But I'm telling you know this secret is drivin' me crazy 
 And I'm tired of creepin' around with YOU 
 Girl I wanna be with YOU 
 Tell me what the hell are we gunna do 
 I'm like oh ooh oh ooh 
 Oh baby, we can't let the industry know 
 Because our cover will be blown 
 If anybody hears or so happens to see, 
 Girl you got your career and I got family 
 And girl that's why 
 We can't let the industry know 
 Because our cover will be blown 
 Don't want it to be blown 
 Gotta keep it on the low 
 Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobdy 
 Girl we can't let the indusrty 
 (Sshh ssh sshh sshh) 
 We have to be careful 
 If we don't want nobody to get hurt 
 We have to keep it privet girl 
 This relationship to ourselves 
 Though I agree 
 Girl its killing me 
 Why do we have to hide from the indusrty 
 And baby girl I'm tired of sneakin and creepin' with one another 
 Everyday it gets harder for me being you secret lover 
 We can't let the industry know 
 Because our cover will be blown 
 If anybody hears or so happens to see, 
 Girl you got your career and I got family 
 And girl that's why 
 We can't let the industry know 
 Because our cover will be blown 
 Don't want it to be blown 
 Gotta keep it on the low 
 Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobdy 
 Girl we can't let the indusrty know
