It's a new day and I feel good 
 If I wanna spread my wings 
 I know that I could 
 I got a feeling that tonight begins 
 A healing where we all win 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the firewooorks 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the firewooorks 
 Laa da diee jam nam nah 
 Awie jam nam nah 
 Awie jam nam nah ohweyooo 
 I feel emotions deep inside my bones 
 Like an ocean when the wave gets strong 
 I feel today is my victory 
 I gotta get out there and make history 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the firewooorks 
 (Said it looks like I can see them) 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the firewooorks 
 Laa da wiee jam nam nah 
 Awie jam nam nah 
 Awie jam nam nah ohweyooo 
 I had a vision, it was real to me 
 Like a new song and my heart that sings 
 Just like the striking of a lightning ball 
 I feel the power of a miracle 
 I can see the fireworks (oohw) 
 I can see the fireworks (fireworks) 
 I can see the firewooorks 
 (Said it looks like I can see them) 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the firewooorks 
 (Fireworks, fireworks, fireworks) 
 Said the sky is glowing with peace love and harmony 
 These days is runnin' with joy cause there's been a victory 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the firewooorks 
 (Said it looks like I can see them) 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the firewooorks 
 (Across the sky, over the water, throughout the city) 
 I can see the fireworks (hey) 
 I can see the fireworks 
 (I can see the fireworks) 
 I can see the firewooorks 
 (Ooh, like a rainbow) 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the fireworks 
 I can see the firewooorks 
 Laa da diee jam nam nah 
 Awie jam nam nah 
 Awie jam nam nah ohweyooo 
 Awie jam nam nah ohweyooo
