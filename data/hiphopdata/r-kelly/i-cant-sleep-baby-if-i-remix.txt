(Talking) 
 Baby I'm sorry 
 Can't you find a way to somehow forgive me 
 I never meant to touch you 
 Somebody take my hand off 
 'Cause I never meant to hit you, babe 
 I know I don't deserve another chance 
 But I had to say it anyway 
 I can't sleep 
 I can't think 
 I can't eat 
 I'm so weak 
 And I won't breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 It was such a silly move I made 
 On the only one who truly loves me 
 Took advantage of the love you gave 
 And turned around the truth 
 Now look at me 
 I can't sleep 
 I can't think 
 I can't eat 
 I'm so weak 
 And I can't breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 Now I'm the n*gga that you read about 
 Every freakin' night it seems 
 Sometimes I can't believe my ears 
 And what they say about me 
 Who gives a f*** about what the think 
 Is what my OG used to say 
 You just keep on doing your own thing boy 
 And sing your praises up that way 
 And you'll sleep 
 And you'll think 
 And you'll eat 
 Won't be weak 
 And you will breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 You will breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 You will breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 You'll breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 Breathe again 
 You'll breathe 
 You'll sleep 
 You'll think 
 Whoo
