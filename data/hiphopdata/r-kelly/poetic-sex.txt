Many ways exist to erase one's dream 
 Many people say the worst one is she 
 Never had a thought that this might be true 
 Till the bloody day I found out how wrong was you 
 I hate you, I hate your sunless smile 
 I see people dying in the name of love 
 Friends and brothers dancing in the love's dom 
 I used to be among the mesmerized ones 
 Till that bloody day I found out how wrong was you 
 I hate you, I hate your sunless smile!

 Misery's queen falls in coma as you pass my door. 
 Not far from what I was looking for you seem 
 The point of no return I step and conquer my dream 
 I'd hold my ships course until the unknown end 
 In promised lands, my oath was, my self to send. 
 The crown of the immortals now you wear 
 The throne of this bloody land you share 
 With millions and millions old brothers' fate 
 Hail to you and this glorious state, of death... 
 You don't bleed... You don't need... You don't feel 
 You don't breath... You don't live... You don't dream... 
 Poetic Sex On You ho ho oh 
 Poetic Sex On You yeah yeah yeah 
 Poetic Sex On You ho ho ho 
 Ay with me souless fiancee, let me thread slip into the sea 
 This liquid horny heaven, your eden's markstone 
 Oh, how amazing is to feed, my generation's tree 
 Awake the beast inside, my picture I'll drown... in you 
 Ardour was I 
 And Ardour still am I 
 Mesmerized in ecstasy's path I walk in etherial orbit 
 Awake by the orgasm of the ogress, thou waves 
 Of liquid fire streams, flowing from this velvet orchid 
 Like onshore breeze intoxicates me, my soul's fave.
