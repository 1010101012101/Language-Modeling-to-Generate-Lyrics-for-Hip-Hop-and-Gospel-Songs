Baby, I'm sorry 
 (Not gonna let you down) 
 Sorry for the things that happened to you, babe 
 For what he did 
 I'll show you that I'm not gonna do those things that he did to you 
 I'm gonna love you I'm gonna hold you 
 I'm gonna give you everythign that your heart desires 
 You don't have to question love 
 'Cause when I get home I'll show you love 
 I know you're hurting baby 
 Because of what he did 
 But here I am to rescue you 
 From that man of sin 
 He took your life from you 
 And noted you for him 
 Promised you brighter days 
 But now your light is dim 
 He had no right to do 
 The things he did to you 
 If I had half a chance 
 Girl, I'd be good to you 
 Don't let don't let don't let don't let 
 Don't let what happened in your past hurt our future
