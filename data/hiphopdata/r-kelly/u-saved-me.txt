True atories (what) 
 Miracles (What) 
 True blessing (What) 
 I was riding in my car one day, 
 In the express lane, rolling on the freeway 
 And suddenly the phone rings, 
 Then I reached down beside me 
 Then I looked on the floor 
 Felt on the back seat 
 See I was drinking while I was driving. 
 Never thinking what I was doin' 
 I turned around and before I knew it 
 Here comes this truck now. 
 The doctor said "I don't think he isn't gonna to make it." 
 Family said "Make the funeral arrangements." 
 Unplug the machine he's gone now, 
 Then told my wife to be strong now 
 Then a small voice said unto me 
 "If you promise to stop drinking,..." 
 I surrendered the pain that day. 
 Now for ten years I've been straight 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me (Thank you Jesus) 
 Gave me a second chance, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me (Thank You Jesus) 
 You saved me (Thank You Jesus) 
 You saved me (Thank You Jesus) 
 Now I've been sitting in this chair, waiting on the phone to ring 
 Praying up to God, that someone would call me with a job opening 
 'Cause it's been so hard for me month to month struggling to eat 
 But still there was no answer (no answer) 
 I stop believing in his word and got so mad at him 
 And when somebody say God's good I'd just laugh at him (oh yeah) 
 But in the nick of time his blessings rained on me by his grace 
 The phone rings a lady says were hiring and that's when I knew he, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me (Thank you Jesus) 
 Gave me a second chance, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me (Thank You Jesus) 
 You saved me (Thank You Jesus) 
 You saved me (Thank You Jesus) 
 Now I was 18 out there on the block selling drugs, 
 With a gun at my waist and for people I had no love 
 See the streets was my home and family and friends were gone 
 Had no one to trust and deep inside I was all alone 
 And then a deal went bad one day and it was enough to pause me 
 I was shot four times and before I knew it I was on my knees 
 Blood rushing out my body, my hearts beating fast, 
 I don't know Imma do don't think I'm gonna last 
 Then I began to flash back on the things I've done in my past 
 Then a very small voice said unto me I'll give you peace if you believe 
 I accepted Christ that day hallelujah now I'm free! 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me (Thank you Jesus) 
 Gave me a second chance, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me (Thank You Jesus) 
 You saved me (Thank You Jesus) 
 You saved me (Thank You Jesus) 
 I was in the aisle of the grocery store with pain in my chest 
 And I'm wondering were did it come from? 
 I got tested and the results came back 
 The doctor said "I'm sorry but you've got cancer." 
 I could not believe it so I called up my momma to calm my nerves 
 (Momma) She got down on her knees 
 (Momma) She said a prayer for me 
 (Momma) Said just keep on thanking Jesus 
 (Momma) "And He'll give you all you need" (thank you Jesus) 
 Now that was five years ago don't have that pain no mo 
 Doc said, "You can go home cause all your cancers gone!" 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me (Thank you Jesus) 
 Gave me a second chance, 
 You saved me, 
 You saved me (Thank You Jesus) 
 You saved me (Thank You Jesus) 
 You saved me (Thank You Jesus) 
 It was by grace that you saved me 
 I'm so thankful that you looked down on me 
 Saw me standing there 
 I was at the end of my rope 
 No where to go then you gave me (A Second chance) 
 I was down and out till (You saved me) 
 I was doing drugs till (You saved me) 
 I was running these streets till (You saved me) 
 Never felt love till (You saved me) 
 I was gang bangin' till (You saved me) 
 Wildin out till (You saved me) 
 On my dying bed (yeah) till You stepped in 
 You saved Me 
 You saved Me...
