Uh, tip the waiter, girl, tip the waiter, uh 
 (I been waiting all night for the club to end) 
 (Now it's time to jump on it) 
 At 12 o'clock I entered the club 
 'Bout 12:15 I'm lookin' at her 
 They said like it's her birthday, like she's on a vaca 
 And I'm just gonna hang out right here till it's clear 
 Visions of her working a pole 
 The combination of that ass and patron 
 Makes a nigga wanna make it rain like a ticker tape parade 
 I can't wait till I get you home 
 Up in the champagne room I got you moanin' 
 All because you windin' on a really hard somethin' 
 (This foreplay) 
 I'm a winner 
 (Is gonna be) 
 Like dinner, yes 
 Patience is a virtue and girl, I feel so glad that I 
 Waited all night for you to finish that dance 
 Tipsy off that liquor and it's makin' me ask 
 Would you tip the waiter? You, tip the waiter 
 You, tip the waiter, tip the waiter 
 Girl I want some gratuity, I don't mean cash 
 Lookin' at your body, it's makin' me wanna ask 
 Would you tip the waiter? You, tip the waiter? 
 Tip the waiter, Tip the waiter 
 Now it's like a quarter to 2 
 And I'm still tryina go home with you 
 But you got your girls around you 
 Y'all sippin' on that hundred proof 
 And I'm just gon lay back 
 And be cool till you're through 
 Dance has got your dress goin' up 
 And you're at the bar refillin' your cup 
 And I'm waitin' up in this club 
 Hopin' you gon' show some love 
 It's 3 o'clock, you're still on the floor 
 Up in the champagne room I got you moanin' 
 All because you grindin' on a really hard somethin' 
 (This foreplay) 
 I'm a winner 
 (Is gonna be) 
 Like dinner, yes 
 Patience is a virtue and girl, I feel so glad that I 
 Waited all night for you to finish that dance 
 Tipsy off that liquor and it's makin' me ask 
 Would you tip the waiter? You, tip the waiter? 
 You tip the waiter, tip the waiter 
 Girl I want some gratuity, I don't mean cash 
 Lookin' at your body it's makin' me wanna ask 
 Would you tip the waiter? You, tip the waiter? 
 You tip the waiter, tip the waiter 
 Wanna make you mine, so girl I'm gonna wait for ya 
 Like I'm on the front line, a soldier's gonna wait for ya 
 Till I see the whites in your eyes, I'll be here 
 I been waitin' all of this time so I'll be here 
 (It's 5:00) 
 I feel so good they're sayin' last call 
 (It's 5:30) 
 And I'm hopin' you're not ready to go home 
 (6:00) 
 I steps to her 
 (6:30) says I'm the R 
 (In the parking lot) 
 Headed in my car and I'm so glad that I 
 I waited all night for you to finish that dance 
 Tipsy off that liquor and it's makin' me ask 
 Would you tip the waiter? You, tip the waiter? 
 You tip the waiter, tip the waiter 
 Girl, I want some gratuity, I don't mean cash 
 Lookin' at your body it's makin' me wanna ask 
 Would you tip the waiter? You, tip the waiter? 
 You tip the waiter, tip the waiter, oh 
 Oh, tip the waiter, oh, oh
