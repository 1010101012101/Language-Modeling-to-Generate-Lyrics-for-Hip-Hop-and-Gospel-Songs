(R Kelly Rapping) 
 (Chorus: Chopped and Screwed) 
 Drop-drop-drop Top Two Seater Me And My Gucci 
 Drop-drop Top Two Seater Me And My Gucci 
 Drop-drop-drop Top Two Seater Me And My Gucci 
 Drop-drop Top Two Seater Me And My Gucci 
 I roll screw, candy applegenni on em 
 Gucci vest, white T, Nikes matching on em 
 Chicks tryna catch I throw a couple dreams on em 
 It's the weatherman, and I'm a make it rain on em 
 Drop hits on 'em magic like tricks on em 
 And they can never be me, 'cause I throw a hats on em 
 I gotta Benz truck, a made boc 
 Yellow two seater Bentley like a lemon drop 
 Where a hundred grand, chest about three hundred grand 
 I denifiy me when you see me pop that rubbaband 
 Used to lookin' chicks sideways since a young boy 
 Gotta crush on dat dollar ever since a young boy 
 Now life's a cnady store as if I was a young boy 
 Living life fast lane, rollin' in them big toys 
 To the white mall, in the Suburban 
 Bout to buy it all, and take some numbers 
 (Chorus: Chopped and Screwed) 
 I'm in high pursuit, 'cause I'm a paper chaser 
 In that coupe switching lanes like I'm speed racing 
 Speeding like a trunk on a weekend 
 Crash the fluid like (WHOSSH) What we drinking? 
 I just blew one and then I'm feeling so right 
 Look in my rearview and I am lookin' so tight 
 I gotta hood chick, but all she wanna do is fight 
 I gotta model chick but she stay higher than a kite 
 I walk up in da club, you would think I froze time 
 Been a playa mayne, ever since the street sign 
 Draped up gotta million, face on it watermelon 
 Contracts up, Kels about to make a killin' 
 I ain't only in the game, I'm from running it 
 Fourth Quarter... didn't need to ball, bitch 
 To the white mall, in the Suburban 
 Bout to buy it all, and take some numbers 
 (Chorus: Chopped and Screwed) 
 Yeah, man I gotta lot of hoes 
 Yup, I'm bragging I got alot of clothes 
 Yup, I'm bragging I got alot of cars 
 Yup, I'm bragging, bitch I'm a superstar 
 And Yup I'm bragging I got alot of ice 
 Yup, I'm bragging got stunners on at night 
 Yup, I'm bragging I'm ballin in the club 
 Yup, I'm bragging and I don't giva fuck 
 (Chorus: Chopped and Screwed)
