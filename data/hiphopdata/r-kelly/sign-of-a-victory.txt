I can see the colors of the rainbow, 
 And I can feel the sun on my face, 
 I see the light at the end of the tunnel, 
 And I can feel heaven in its place, 
 And that's the sign of a victory 
 And that's the sign of a victory 
 I can feel the spirit of the nations 
 And I can feel my wings ridin' the winds, yeah 
 I see the finish line just up ahead na 
 And I can feel it risin' deep within 
 And that's the sign of a victory 
 And that's the sign of a victory 
 Now I can the distance of the journey, 
 High and front with all your might, 
 You open your eyes to global warming, 
 Been through it all, you sacrificed your life 
 And that's the sign of a victory 
 And that's the sign of a victory 
 If we believe, we can achieve anything including the impossible this I know so lets lift up our heads and raise the flag yeah yeah and scream like you want to win now let the games begin! 
 That's the sign of a victory 
 That's the sign of a victory 
 That's the sign of a victory

 That's the sign of a victory 
 When darkness is all around you, you still find your way 
 That's the sign of a victory

 Sign of a victory
