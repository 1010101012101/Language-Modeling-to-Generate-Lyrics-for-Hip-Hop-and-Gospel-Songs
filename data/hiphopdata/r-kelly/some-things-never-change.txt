Some people may say 
 That some people I love you 
 And, some people may find 
 That some people weren't true 
 And some people may vow 
 That they'll never part 
 And people promise people 
 That they will never break their hearts 
 Ooh-ooh 
 But when it comes to us 
 I thank heaven up above 
 'Cause we just keep on lovin' 
 We just keep on kissin' 
 We just keep on huggin' 
 We just keep on waitin' 
 Boy I tell you 
 Somethings never change 
 Like pictures in a frame 
 And the flowers bloom in may 
 For as long as I am breathing my heart will always stay 
 I tell you somethings never change 
 In the springtime it will rain 
 And the world going round and round 
 There's nothing new 
 And that's how I feel about you 
 Now, some people believe 
 That, some people will be there 
 And, some poeple came to see 
 That some people didn't care 
 So-ooh-ooome people may think that 
 They can trust some people 
 But some people come to find 
 That the people that they thought they knew they really don't know know-know-ooh-ooh 
 When it comes to us (when it comes to us) I thank heaven up up 
 'Cause we keep on lovin' 
 We just keep on kissin' 
 We just keep on touchin' 
 We just keep on waitin' 
 Boy I tell you 
 (That is how I feel) that is how I feel about you-ooh-ooh 
 And it'll never change no no 
 That is how I feel 
 Whoa-ooh 
 Ooh-oh-oh-ooh 
 Somethings never change 
 Like the pictures in the frame (in the frame) 
 And the flowers bloom in may 
 For as long as I am breathing my heart will surely stay 
 I tell you 
 Somethings never, somethings never change 
 Like the pictures in a frame (pictures in a frame) 
 And the flowers (all of the flowers bloom in may) 
 For as long as I am breathing my will always stay the same 
 Somethings never change (whoa-ooh-ooh change) 
 In the springtime it will rain (it will surely rain) 
 And the world going round and round 
 There's nothing new 
 Till the ???? 
 Somethings never change 
 And I place no, one above you babe 
 Because I love you bay-beee 
 Ooh-ooh always babe 
 You be lovin' me and I be loving you 
 Somethings, somethings never change
