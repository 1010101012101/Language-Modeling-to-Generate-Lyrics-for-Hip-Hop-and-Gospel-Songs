I feel that the time is here 
 For you to bring your body here 
 And give me what I've waited for 
 Hurry up and come on in and close the door 
 I'm about to get up on it 
 Feed me girl 'cause I'm so hungry 
 Got plenty money but I'm still lonely 
 Gotta have you now 'cause me so [horny] 
 Black and Asian girl, tattoo on your tummy 
 Thugged out and scared but I'ma make you love me 
 Sip some aphrodisiac and baby girl it's on 
 I promise you I will do all these words to this song 
 Showdown 
 I'm about to lay your... 
 Body down 
 Rodeo be like... 
 Up and down 
 'Bout to show you how I... 
 Throw down 
 It's about to be a...

 Hello? 
 Francis, it's me, Frank 
 Hold on, I'm on the phone - who is this? 
 Frank 
 Stop that when I'm on the phone 
 Listen, turn the music down 
 Hold on - I said I tell you to stay off the phone when I'm on the phone 
 You know when I'm on the phone you ain't supposed to talk... like that 
 Shit 
 Hello? 
 Yeah, Francis 
 Yeah 
 Is Asia over there? 
 Asia ain't over here 
 Well do you know where she is? 
 Nah, I don't - I don't know where she is, no 
 You don't know where she is?!? 
 No, I don't know where she is, man I ain't got nothin' to do with all of y'all's business, that's on y'all 
 Now wait a minute, I didn't ask you all of that, I just wanna know where she is, and if you don't know, that's it 
 Then that's it then 
 I'll be makin' you my lady 
 S-E-[X] got me goin' crazy 
 Anything that you want me to do 
 I'll do anything 'cause I'm feeling you 
 All freshed up girl you dance so freaky (Asia, where are you?) 
 Tongue done and pierced with a look that's kinky 
 Actin' like you want me to turn you [out] 
 Attitude like "what? Kelly take me now" 
 Black and Asian girl, tattoo on your tummy 
 Thugged out and scared but I'ma make you love me 
 Sip some aphrodisiac, baby girl it's on 
 I promise I will do all the words to this song 
 Showdown

 Word up, I'm on my way. One 
 Angie...

 Wake up, c'mon, move over

 Business

 My business 
 Can I come? 
 Heh, haven't you cum enough?!? 
 T', TJ... 
 No, look, I'll be back, a'ight? Go to sleep 
 Now gimme the mic so I can get buh-buh 
 Like fiesta, fiesta, still movin' the crowd 
 Out of all the girls I've loved before 
 Got plenty of honeys [#%&@] 
 Puff, puff give now let me hit it once more 
 Fake ass niggas get out and close my door 
 This' my house for me to live, not yours 
 If I wanted to I could [shit] on the floors 
 Through the doors like a western flip, the club is crunked 
 Henny and Cris' you know that boy's toe up 
 About eight or nine black stallions ridin' up 
 It's Mr. Biggs screamin' "showdown", I'm like "what?" 
 Now Kelly 
 It's not enough room in this town 
 For you and me so let's get down 
 I'm sick and tired of you and this 'Down Low' fight 
 From 'Contagious' all the way to Mrs. Price 
 You've done it now with Ms. Black Asian 
 I knew sumthin' was funny when she stopped pagin' 
 House, cars, shoppin' malls 
 Man, I tell you, it's the battle call 
 Like a raging bull, I'm about to charge you 
 Kelly, you won't see tomorrow 
 It's time to put an end to your late night creeps 
 Now any last word before my pistol speaks? 
 Mr. Biggs 
 Now, no disrespect but man I'm tired 
 'Cause all these years it's my back you've been ridin' 
 We've been in and out of fights on these radios 
 Now it's about time you felt the real rodeo (oh I) 
 Said I'll beat it like the 98 of September 
 You took her from me, yeah right you don't remember 
 I remember so clearly we were comin' from an Opera 
 How clever you were when you slipped her your number 
 (Ooh-ooh) I know that makes y'all wanna know 
 (Ooh-ooh) who's really on the down low 
 You wonder why we're always at it, there it is 
 Sleeves up Mr. Biggs 'cause I'm about to get 
 (Wild wild west) I'm sick and tired of your mess 
 You've put me to the test, now I'm stickin' out my chest 
 So any last words before I draw these canons? 
 'Cause when the smoke clears I'll be the last man standin' at the... 
 Showdown 
 I'm about to lay your... 
 Body down 
 Rodeo be like... 
 Up and down 
 'Bout to show you how I... 
 Throw down 
 It's about to be a... 
 Showdown 
 I'm about to lay your...

 My rodeo be like...

 Baby it's about to be a...
