Did you ever think that you would be rich 
 Did you ever think that you would have these hits 
 Did you ever think that you would be the don 
 Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn 
 Did you ever think that you would be this paid 
 Were these times when your ass was real afraid 
 Did you ever think that you would sell out tours 
 Have a show with fifty million viewers 
 I used to think about how I was gonna make it 
 Struggling day to day trying to get this paper 
 Hoping the day would come when things would go my way 
 And now I'm lying lavish and all I do is think and say 
 Did you ever think that you would be rich 
 Did you ever think that you would have these hits 
 Did you ever think that you would be the don 
 Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn 
 Did you ever think that you would be this paid 
 Were these times when your ass was real afraid 
 Did you ever think that you would sell out tours 
 Have a show with fifty million viewers 
 Now I've been around the world and seen so many Things 
 Partied in every club nothing but VIP 
 I never take for granted these luxuries I have 
 Just try my best to answer all of those questions that I ask 
 Did you ever think that you would be rich 
 Did you ever think that you would have these hits 
 Did you ever think that you would be the don 
 Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn

 I used to play the game and like the same ole same 
 Dreamin' 'bout city lights it was my only life 
 And now this world I chose as if I did not own 
 Now I can't go nowhere without you all wanting to know 
 Did you ever think that you would be rich
