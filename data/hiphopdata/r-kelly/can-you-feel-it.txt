Ooh, clap your hands everybody 
 Can you feel it? 
 Can you feel it? oh 
 The sun is shining nah 
 Nothing but blue sky 
 The storm has gone away 
 Here comes the perfect day 
 The burdens up off my shoulder 
 Plus my struggles over 
 Climbed the mountains and we made it here 
 Can you feel it? can you feel it? can you feel it? can you feel it? 
 Can you feel it? ooh can you feel it yeah, can you feel it? can you feel it ooh, can you feel it? can you feel it? 
 Show your hand if you feel it... 
 The wind is underneath 
 About to spread my wings 
 Take off like a bird 
 'Cause I've been set free...
