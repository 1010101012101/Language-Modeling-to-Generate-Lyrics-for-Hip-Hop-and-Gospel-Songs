Oh baby, If I could explain the joy I feel ... 
 Ooh If I could explain the joy I feel 
 Ooh this love makin' baby it's so real 
 Ooh like winter time by the fireplace 
 Ooh like traped in walls and its no escape 
 Ooh like a precious jewel with no price tag 
 Ooh like waterfalls comin' down on me 
 Ooh like a tidal wave comin' from the sea 
 Ooh like a favorite scene in a big movie 
 You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby (Ooh) 
 You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby (If you wanna know) 
 You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby (Ooh Just like) 
 You wanna know how I feel just like that, just like that baby 
 Ooh like you and me makin' history baby 
 Ooh like a 99th annervirsary 
 Ooh like a baby when it speaks its first words 
 Ooh like an uplifting song the first time heard 
 Ooh like a shelter when the storm gets ruff 
 Ooh like a mountain top from the bottom up 
 Ooh like an expensive suite at the best hotel 
 Ooh like a work of art when its unvailed 
 You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (like that) 
 You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (oh oh oh oh oh, If you wanna know) 
 You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (just like that yeah) 
 You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that (Ooh) 
 Ooh like a great blu skys on a summer day 
 Ooh like sittin' close in a small cafe 
 Ooh like makin' love to someone you love 
 Ooh like breakin up then makin' up 
 Ooh like a warm embrace when you come around 
 Ooh like the sweetest words when your feelin' down 
 Ooh like lost inside of a mascarade 
 Ooh like a celebration in a big parade 
 Ooh like a secret told to the one you trust 
 Ooh like kissin' you in a all white tux 
 You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (If you wanna know) 
 You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (Just like that, If You wanna know) 
 You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that baby (Just like that) 
 You wanna know how I feel, just like that, just like that 
 Like the moon, yeah when it glows at night, 
 And like the sun oh yeah when it shines real bright, 
 And just like the ocean when the whale jumps high, 
 Like an eagle when it soars the sky
