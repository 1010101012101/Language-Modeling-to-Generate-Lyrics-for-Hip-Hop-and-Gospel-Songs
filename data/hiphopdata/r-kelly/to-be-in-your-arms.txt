Last night you called, I could have talked forever 
 Haven't heard your voice in so long, it's been so hard living without you 
 I have to be strong, but I found an island in your heart 
 A place where we might start 
 To live a life together forever 
 I would climb any old mountain 
 I would cross any old river 
 To be in your arms 
 I'll do anything 
 Who would have thought things would come between us 
 You went your way and I went mine 
 I guess sometimes we start believeing 
 There's so much more to find 
 But I found this island in your heart 
 A place where we might start 
 To live a life together forever 
 Ooh ohoh! 
 But I found this island in your heart 
 A place where we might start 
 To live a life together forever
