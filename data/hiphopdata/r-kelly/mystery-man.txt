They think that you are crazy 
 But I like you like that! 
 You know that I'm lazy 
 And my stomach's gettin' fat 
 Oh Mystery man! 
 Don't chew me in your horn! 
 Mystery man! 
 My baby's getting born! 
 Oh Mystery man, 
 I like you like that! 
 They takin' all ya money 
 'Cause they thinking that its funny 
 They like to take their chances 
 'Cause they thinkin' that you nothin' 
 Oh Mystery man, 
 Don loose your cool 
 Mystery man 
 You ain't no fool! 
 Oh Mystery Man, 
 I like you like dat!
