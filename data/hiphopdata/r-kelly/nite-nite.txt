(Mike Skinner) 
 Seriously man, 
 Like, you know when you got a good girl, 
 Or you know when she means something to you, & you got like, a name. 
 (Leo The Lion) 
 Here we go again 
 Here we go 
 (Mike Skinner) 
 Like I had a name for this girl, I used to call her "Ladybird", 
 'Cause she always played red, in Connect Four. 
 [Leo The Lion](Chorus) 
 Link 'em and leave then 'em high, 
 I've been tellin' all my man's for time, 
 Link 'em and then leave 'em high, 
 They never take my advice, 
 But now I realize, I realize why, 
 They have not been listening all this time, 
 'Cause since I linked you, last night, 
 I won't be taking my advice 
 (Kano) 
 Look, 
 I call her "Night night" 
 (?) 
 But we getting on fine right, 
 I don't wanna spoil it, 
 I don't why I can't commit to girls, 
 And I tell white lies, I'll find out the hard way, 
 'Cause she got my favourite smile, her favourite style, 
 The first hotel, My favourite time, 
 And maybe later we could have a baby, maybe a baby boy, my 
 Favourite child, 
 "I'm way too tired", My favourite lie, 
 I wasn't too sure of her favourite rhyme 
 The windows are steaming up like it's naked time, 
 Wait, we're way too bait, 
 I bought her favourite shoes, or they better be, 
 And she's even my favourite size, 
 And she knows I hate holding hands, and I'm hooded up when it's 
 Bait inside, 
 So I guess she's my favorite, right? 
 (Leo the Lion) 
 Right, 
 'Cause nothing comes close to you. 
 (Kano) 
 So numbers? No boys are taking yours, 
 And no girls are taking mine, 
 Groupies? **** that, I'm taking time, 
 We speak from like 8 till late at night, 
 When we gets on top, drop my favourite line: 
 (Leo the Lion) 
 Girl, I ain't going nowhere. 
 [Kano](spoken) 
 I plain ain't going nowhere, 
 But, I like you, and it might take some time, 
 But really I'm like: 
 (Leo the Lion and Kano) 
 Here we go again, 
 [Leo the Lion](Chorus) 
 (Kano) 
 I call her sometimes, and I wake her up at some dumb times, 
 Touch my phone, and her number my thumb finds, 
 'Cause she's ideal, like a nice meal, 
 And a night in, with a nice feel, 
 Maybe some wine, 
 Maybe sometime we could hold hands in the park, in the sunshine, 
 Sometimes, 
 Be patient with me if I got 3 raves in 1 week, 
 Or in a studio, away for a week, 
 One we could book a vacation and leave, 
 But please: "No drama", I don't need beef like (?) 
 I'm just focused on making the peas, Breaking the team, Chasing a 
 Dream, 
 I ain't on the street, maybe sometimes, 
 But you can't say I don't make enough time, 
 We speak everyday and meet everyweek, 
 So I dunno. Maybe it's me. 
 You? You got it planned out, 
 I don't make plans, 
 You know me, I wait and I see, 
 But if we were together, or even now, 
 If we weren't "sort-of", but were together, 
 Would you be faithfull to me? 
 Treat me massage me and make me a tea? 
 Come link me, lay and wake up from sleep, and look hot like 80 
 Degrees? 
 (Leo the Lion) 
 And you know I never say that sort of thing 
 [Kano](spoken) 
 See? That's an angel to me 
 I wouldn't have said that before, you get me? 
 [Leo the Lion](Chorus) 
 (Leo the Lion) 
 No, no, no, no, no, no 
 Oh my, my, ow, 
 Baby we could do this again sometime, 
 I even have a special name for you, 
 It's "Long Baby", 'cause you always on my mind, yeah. 
 I'll tell you straight, so straight, yeah, 
 I won't tell my mates, 
 No, no, I know, No, I know, oh 
 Yeah I like you, 
 Here we, 
 Here we go again, 
 Here we, 
 Here we go again.
