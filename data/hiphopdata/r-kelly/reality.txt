She didn't have a house, a house up in the hills 
 I never heard her ask for some car with the chromed out wheels 
 But all she wanted was some love and affection 
 But all I did all the time was neglect 
 The fact that she was lonely, I used to be her homey 
 I used to talk about how I was gonna get us out of the hood 
 But as long as we're together as a family, then it's all good
