 I can tell just by lookin' at yo body 
 When you walk up in the club girl 
 That you got good sex 
 And even though I haven't touched it 
 Best believe that I can trust it 
 When I look at u 
 That you got good sex 
 And I'm tryin' 2 see what's dat like 
 When we leave this club tonight 
 'Cause girl I can tell 
 That you got that good sex 
 So put yo hands up 
 Ladies put yo hands up 
 If you got that good sex 
 Kellz: 
 Ooh my goodness 
 Sex at 1st sight girl 
 When I look at u 
 Walkin' and talkin' 
 While you strutin that thang 
 Across the room 
 Shit you almost made me spill my drink 
 All over me girl 
 Where you get that booty girl? 
 I wanna 
 Smack, smack flip it up 
 Jump on in like double dutch 
 Baby, give yo hand 2 me 
 Let's get down on 23's 
 And I'll be windin it slow 
 While yo juices flow (whoa, whoa) 
 Baby girl please believe 
 That can't nobody please yo body 
 Like my body can please yo body 
 And girl I can back it up 
 Just give me a chance to sex it up (oh) 
 On yo knees and el (bows)- elbows 
 While I'm hittin it (slow) 
 Girl I'm puttin' on a (show) 
 Then right after sex 
 We can spend the night together 
 Wake up 
 And be like whatever 
 It doesn't matter 2 me 
 As long as ur chillin' wit me 
 Said I'm gonna make ur body go (eek, eek, eek, eek, eek) 
 Girl I promise 2 make yo body go (eek, eek, eek, eek, eek) 
 Girl you don't have 2 take off no clothes 
 It's a shame you look so good 
 That I wanna hit it wit yo clothes on 
 Twista: 
 Now when it come 2 cuttin' 
 Can't nobody fade dawg 
 Come 'n' get wit the twist 
 I'm a made star 
 Wit one grip of the wrist 
 Like ray charles 
 I know she thick 
 And the dick gon stay hard 
 I ain't gotta say I fucked her 
 I can just straight out fuck her 
 I can use my mind 
 When I touch her 
 Pretty skin wit yo look right structure 
 The only difference between us 
 Is you on the dance floor 
 And I'm the on tip 
 But we both be grindin 
 I know that you good up in the bed 
 When they bumpin reggae music 
 N yo waist be windin 
 I love it how you make yo booty move 
 When the DJ go (er, er, er, er) 
 I'm love it when we get up in the bed 
 N the headboard go (er, er, er, er) 
 I can tell just by lookin' at yo body 
 When you walk up in the club girl 
 That you got good sex 
 And even though I haven't touched it 
 Best believe that I can trust it 
 When I look at u 
 That you got good sex 
 And I'm tryin' 2 see what's dat like 
 When we leave this club tonight 
 'Cause girl I can tell 
 That you got that good sex 
 So put yo hands up 
 Ladies put yo hands up 
 If you got that good sex 
 Kellz: 
 Girl, I wanna hit it wit yo clothes on 
 Baby, u don't have 2 take them boy shorts off 
 Let me tell you why 
 'Cause I got my hand on yo shoulders 
 Bout 2 move a lil things over 
 Bout 2 kiss you down yo back 
 Then after that I'm gonna cling on ya 
 (Muah, muah, muah, muah) gonna kiss yo body, kiss yo body girl 
 (Muah, muah, muah) let's get up out of this party girl 
 When you drop it, stop it, roll it, pop it 
 Make it jerk 'n' wind it, work it 
 Then baby girl I already know 
 (Chorus: till song fades)
