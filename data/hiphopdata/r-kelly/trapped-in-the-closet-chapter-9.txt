He looks around the kitchen, and says "Something is really weird", 
 She says "Why do you say that?" He says "'Cause you keep tryin' to get me outta here", 
 He says "Ever since I been in this house your face has went from white to red 
 And remember when I first walked through the door you acted like you had seen a ghost from the dead." 
 Then he says "Girl if you hidin' something I'm gonna be so mad", 
 Then he hears something fallin' he says "What the fuck was that?" 
 She says "It sound like it came from upstairs, sounds like the plumbing", 
 He said "Woman that sound did not come from upstairs, I'll be damned if you're not up to something. 
 "The sound that I just heard, it came from this kitchen." 
 And then he looks over by the stove while she's easin' over by the dishes. 
 And then he walks over to the refrigerator and pushes it back, 
 And then he looks in her face, looks like she's about to have a heart-attack, 
 Then he notices the pie on the counter, one slice is missing, now the story's gettin' scary, 
 'Cause he comes to realise that Bridget is allergic to cherry. 
 Then he slowly looks up at her and now her face is red as hell, 
 He's breathing real hard, movin' closer, she says "Hon, you don't look so well" 
 And then he says "Move." She says "No." 
 He says "Move!" She says "NO!" 
 " 
 Bitch move! 
 " she moves! 
 And then, He looks at the cabinet, he walks to the cabinet, 
 He's close to the cabinet, now he's opening the cabinet... 
 Now pause the movie 'cause what I'm about to say to y'all is so damn twisted, 
 Not only is there a man in his cabinet, but the man... is a MIDGET! 
 ([Echoing] MIDGET!... Midget!... Midget!... Midget!...)
