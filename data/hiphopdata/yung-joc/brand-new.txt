 (You, you, you prolly can't help that, that, you know) 
 And I buy all my *** brand new 
 (I don't have a problem with spendin' the money, you know) 
 When I walk into the room they choose 
 (I mean, I'm Yung Joc man, come on) 
 'Cause they know my whips, my ice is brand new 
 From my fitted down to my shoes 
 I enter the room and your *** might choose 
 Look me up and down from my head to toe 
 They point the exit, then I tell 'em let's go 
 S5 don't forget the fifty 
 What it cost me? About a hundred fifty 
 Damn what's this, why so sticky? 
 That's good Kush, would?a cost ya 'bout a hundred fifty 
 Still on another level, still brand new 
 Lookin' at the sky through that panoramic view

 You know my entourage, I does it extra large 
 Blue bezels for my nizzles, double what you charge 
 So whenever you see me, you know I'm Fresh2Death 
 French tip on my nails and now my hair is fresh 
 In some brand new clothes with some brand new hoes 
 Is that Phantom doors on that brand new Rolls 
 On another level, blue rose petals 
 And when I walk the block, I make everybody wanna talk a lot 
 To brag and boast that ain't my style, to high signin' and profile 
 I'd rather blow a pound with my pound and do what you say

 That everythin' you get is used 
 (You, you, you prolly can't help that, that, you know)
