 New joc city beatin' through ya fifteens 
 Alpine amps push button flip screens 
 Nigga watch the ashes 
 Don't burn the seats

 I'm often by the tap 
 I do this just for fun 
 It's dark when I enter, 
 When I leave break of dawn 
 Don't wanna gucci shades 
 Block rays from the sun 
 Call in sick, 
 Cause ya days just begun 
 Pineapple juice, it approve bacardi rum 
 Liquor on my breath 
 So I keep a pack of gum 
 I keep the hemi cocked, 
 So ya know it's not on safe 
 Partna don't hate, 
 Ya minds a terrible thing to waste 
 Block got the keys to the sweet 
 I'm on the way 
 Darlin' got that hoochie poppin', 
 Coochie givin' face 
 5,4,3,2,1 it's a rap 
 Check the sound scan 
 I'm on fire like the trap 
 They keep jockin

 This I know (say wuh)
