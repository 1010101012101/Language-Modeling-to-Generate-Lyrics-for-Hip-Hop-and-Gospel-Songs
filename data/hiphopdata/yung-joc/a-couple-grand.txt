 A couple gran, price tag on ya head, on ya head, on ya head 
 A couple gran, price tag on ya head, price tag on ya head 
 A couple gran, price tag on ya head leave ya layin were ya stand 
 Watch him die slow, and then his eyes roll 
 In da back of his head now his body cold 
 A couple gran, a couple shots, a couple drip drops, now ya leakin won't stop 
 Bitch I'm da man, just ask block, shots rain out, u can hear 'em from a couple blocks 
 Bitch wats my name? call me yung joc, I got a great aim, all I need is one shot 
 Errbody talkin' in my neighborhood, I got great lawyers, 'cause my paper good, 
 Leave ya body riddled, weazin and coughin, hear 'bout it live, fox 5, and monica coffman 
 U fuck wit mine, I cross ya lifeline, I'm a graffiti artist, paint chalk out outlines 
 And the worst part, is I'm not a coward, visit yo wake and give ya momma dead flowers 
 This is not a movie, no reruns, all sales final, no refunds 
 Once I make the payment, the hits out, I'm not jeezy I ain't swappin shit out 
 First I tell him, were I want it done, in the backyard right in front of his son 
 Then I tell him, were to drop him off, in the chattahoochie wit his dick chopped off (damn!) 
 Yes dats harsh, but its well deserve, feed his ass to the sharks for orderves 
 No remorse, no pity, this can happen to you in new jock city 
 I got a couple killas, got a great choppa, blast through ya fool, shit ya guts leak out, 
 The sheriff call ya momma, and she freak out, got a hit meant fo her, dial yo momma speed dial 
 Ooh it ain't nutn, but a call away, come home and find yo baby sista in the hallway 
 9-1-1, but it's too late, she lookin' like a maxi-pad bleeding through da duck tape
