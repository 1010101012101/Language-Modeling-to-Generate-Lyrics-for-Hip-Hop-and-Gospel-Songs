(Yung Joc) 
 Joc Joc don't stop, oh my God you're so hot 
 Catch me on yo' block with 4 glocks and 4 shots 
 Bet you niggaz know not, try me like a ho not 
 Niggaz run in, kick the do', fuck a do' knock 
 Gotta make the quarter, I mix it with the soda 
 I chop the dope and sell it with the Razor Motorola 
 Hold up 'fore I have to load up, hollow tips they explode up 
 Leave you pussy niggaz wet as chocha stankin with the odor 
 Bring your own beer to the party - aight~! 
 Bring your own beer to the party - aight~! 
 Bring your own beer to the party motherfuckers 
 'Cause I heard you came to have a good time - aight~! 
 All right, all right, all right, all right - ah let's go~! 
 All right, all right, all right, all right - ah let's go~! 
 All right, all right, all right, all right - ah let's go~! 
 All right, all right, all right, all right - let's go motherfucker! 
 (Yung Joc) 
 Yeah 
 Yung Joc so jiggy, Lear Jet to yo' city 
 Monday night, Magic City, thunderstorm when I'm tippin 
 Ice game, super nifty, super kush, two for fifty 
 Fat boy yellin' out, pop bottles till I'm tipsy 
 I like my chick booty big-o, lay my head on them big ole's 
 Put her on her tiptoes, I get up in the middle 
 I don't wine them, dine them, or rest have 'em 
 I'm the #1 playboy, I press play and 
 (Yung Joc) 
 Party like a rockstar, better yet, block bar 
 Lighter to the ceiling, grab a beer, pop the top boi 
 I.F. so clear, freezer burn both ears 
 Elders say "Oh dear" when they hear I'm near 
 Rubber burn first gear, platinum on my first year 
 Wood on my sheer, put my wood all in her grill 
 Roof on fire, sound the alarm 
 We don't need water (let the motherfucker burn) 
 (Yung Joc) 
 Ha ha, 5 4 3 2, R-2-D-2 
 Let me see your robot, a little dance that we do 
 Pyrite, no left, I'm hype, with no help 
 On cloud 9 - heart racin like Corvette 
 I need a material girl in a material world 
 Give me slim on the backseat of my Imperial girl 
 Go and show me what you work with, girl that's a perfect fit 
 Hold up, stop, it hurts when you twist it 
 (Chorus - to fade)
