Well I guess safe its safe to say I'm on my joc 
 And everything I say seem to come from the heart 
 And even if ya hate ya gotta play ya part 
 Or just kick back and chill till I play my cards. 
 Okay I'm back, sit back and listen 
 First album platinum plaques now watch it glisten 
 The badest broads, the fastest cars, 
 I'm sure a lot of niggas wish this life was yours 
 What says it ain't, y'all niggas said I can't 
 Ya laughed about my dance, I walked it out the bank 
 Now my lady happy 'cause we ain't gotta starve 
 Hatas mad at me, 'cause I'm on my joc 
 I congratulate ya somebodys gotta do it 
 I'm not bad, I'm used to it 
 And if ya feel the same then youz a friend of mine 
 Wontcha tell them lames, don't get outta line 
 Well I guess safe its safe to say I'm on my joc 
 And everything I say seem to come from the heart 
 And even if ya hate ya gotta play ya part 
 Or just kick back and chill till I play my cards. 
 Play ya cards, don't get outta line, don't get outta line, don't get outta line 
 Play ya cards, don't get outta line, don't get outta line, don't get outta line 
 Call it hustlenomics, hustle by any means 
 I got a lot of hustle, a whole lot of schemes 
 There's not enough fingers for me to count on 
 My stalks way up, call me dow jones 
 I've been around the world, in almost every hood 
 I walk anywhere, this card is very good 
 And they don't play round, down in H town 
 Ill take ya to the bottom, I'm talking dade county 
 I take ya out west, in them lo lo's 
 Scared to rep ya set, that's a no no 
 I take ya back to the A town, 
 Hey now, play around, or ill make them boys make ya lay it down 
 Well I guess safe its safe to say I'm on my joc 
 And everything I say seem to come from the heart 
 And even if ya hate ya gotta play ya part 
 Or just kick back and chill till I play my cards. 
 Play ya cards, don't get outta line, don't get outta line, don't get outta line 
 Play ya cards, don't get outta line, don't get outta line, don't get outta line 
 I need a bottom bitch, one who pays attention 
 Respect the grind, respect my intuition 
 Don't get outta line, just look and listen 
 And soon you'll find, I'm what you've been missin' 
 And the bottom line is I'm on the clock 
 24/7 the hustle don't stop 
 Oh ya I'm from the A, that's my stompin ground 
 And if ya on ya joc we stand on common ground 
 Well I guess safe its safe to say I'm on my joc 
 And everything I say seem to come from the heart 
 And even if ya hate ya gotta play ya part 
 Or just kick back and chill till I play my cards. 
 Play ya cards, don't get outta line, don't get outta line, don't get outta line 
 Play ya cards, don't get outta line, don't get outta line, don't get outta line
