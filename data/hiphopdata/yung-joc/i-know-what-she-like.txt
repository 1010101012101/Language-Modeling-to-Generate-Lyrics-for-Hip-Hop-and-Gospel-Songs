I'm yellin' oh, I know what she like 
 I know what she like, I know what she like 
 I'm yellin' oh, I know what she like 
 I know what she like, I know what she like 
 In the morning, when she yawning 
 I like it when she moanin' when she on it 
 What she like, what she like, what she like oh? 
 What she like, what she like, what she like oh? 
 She like it when I tickle that 
 When I sit it on her back 
 She like it when I toss that ass up 
 Flip her like an acrobat 
 She dig it when I digging that 
 Squeeze that ass, she pleased with that 
 She like it when I make her lose her mind 
 Just like that Jeezy cat 
 We was at the Libra 
 On that Seagrams and a Keysha pad 
 I never said a word and I'm content 
 And I'm gon' leave with that 
 Go creep with that, gon' sleep with that 
 Make her pay a fee for that 
 She like the way I tax that ass, wax that ass 
 Now bring it bac 
 Them legs cocked, knees bent 
 Face off in my pillow bitch 
 She's screamin Joc 'cause she in shock 
 Yeah this dick magnificent 
 She like it in the morning 
 'Cause she keep on screaming it 
 Think it's domestic abuse 
 The way I keep on beatin' it 
 I'm yellin' oh, I know what she like 
 I know what she like, I know what she like 
 I'm yellin' oh, I know what she like 
 I know what she like, I know what she like 
 In the morning, when she yawning 
 I like it when she moanin' when she on it 
 What she like, what she like, what she like oh? 
 What she like, what she like, what she like oh? 
 Six o'clock in the morning, I wake up to head 
 She my alarm clock, my breakfast in bed, good mornin' 
 I like 'em red, I like 'em dark 
 I like them soft, she like him hard 
 In the morning 
 I swear to God, I'ma beat it up, assault charge 
 Fitted hat, to the back 
 I'ma gangsta, g'd up, she lovin' that 
 She touch her toes 
 I'm touching that, I am 
 Truth be told 
 I'm cuttin' it 
 She like it in the morning 
 'Cause she keep on screaming it 
 Hotel complaints, the front desk trippin' 
 I just keep on beating it 
 I'm yellin' oh, I know what she like 
 I know what she like, I know what she like 
 I'm yellin' oh, I know what she like 
 I know what she like, I know what she like 
 In the morning, when she yawning 
 I like it when she moanin' when she on it 
 What she like, what she like, what she like oh? 
 What she like, what she like, what she like oh? 
 I make her juice box wet, damn near break her neck 
 One leg up, and I hit her with the flex 
 I'm kissing her on her neck, girl you know what's next 
 Scratching up my chest, with her minks all in my flesh 
 What she like, what she like? 
 When I'm on my Mr. Marcus shit 
 Fuckin' her with my boots on 
 Extra grip is hard to slip 
 What she like, what she like? 
 When we do it to this song 
 I toot it and boot it 
 Throw the deuces and I'm gone 
 I'm yellin' oh, I know what she like 
 I know what she like, I know what she like 
 I'm yellin' oh, I know what she like 
 I know what she like, I know what she like 
 In the morning, when she yawning 
 I like it when she moanin' when she on it 
 What she like, what she like, what she like oh? 
 What she like, what she like, what she like oh?
