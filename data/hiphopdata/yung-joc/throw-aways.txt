Chorus (Yung Joc) 
 Serve them birds tote K's 
 Cheverolet's on top of blades 
 All of us got throw aways 
 Bustin' out the Escalade 
 Bustin' out the Escalade 
 Bust-bustin' out the Escalade 
 Bustin' out the Escalade 
 All of us got throw aways 
 Verse 1 (Yung Joc) 
 Whole lotta n****z got a lot to say 
 Save your breath or state your case 
 Speak your mind or be on your way 
 Ain't got time for the games you play 
 Every n***a in my squad got a strap 
 Grind hard to put the block on the map 
 If the city ain't sellin' 
 And the people ain't yellin' 
 I'm tellin' ya I'm goin' back hard in the trap 
 Hustlenomics all I know 
 Flip that money stack that doe 
 Think your funny slap that hoe 
 Take his money text that hoe 
 Yeah I said it I'll say it again 
 When I play it I play it to win 
 Choppa chop of all your limbs 
 Doc' it ain't no savin' him 
 Chorus (Yung Joc) 
 Verse 2 (Trae) 
 N****z mad but I'm here for the crown 
 All walk ass n****z betta lay the f*** down 
 Homie I'm the king when it come to these streets 
 You don't wanna go there n***a sit the f*** down 
 Fours get loaded every time I come 'round 
 If I take you to the hood you will never get found 
 When I come out with the K 
 Everybody better pray 
 If I bust you can hear it from the other side of town 
 Get a few of these runnin' at you light fast 
 Dumb fly ass n****z get dropped to the land 
 Then I got a few goons on stand for a grand 
 I'm a a**hole sittin' with a nice set of hands 
 G for real I put the H on the map 
 Talk s*** bitch I'ma get a case on that 
 F*** rap I done put 'em in they place on that 
 I'm the certified truth goin' off on a track 
 Chorus (Yung Joc) 
 Verse 3 (Gorilla Zoe) 
 F***in' with a n***a like me get your whole head bust 
 Cock back I bust 
 I stay strapped 'cause I love that rush 
 4 point slip when they push your guts n***a 
 Head on the pillow you in a coffin 
 Momma she cryin' your kids they orphans 
 Ain't no shells 'cause n***a we found them 
 I'm the problem you can't solve him 
 Cook 'em chop 'em serve 'em shop 'em 
 We go broke my n***a we robbin' 
 Eat what we kill why you all play possum 
 Shop what you want my product's awesome 
 We stay strapped one five carbon 
 18 flat and ain't no bargains 
 Cut my work so we up'ed my margins 
 It's a drop so yeah I charge 'em 
 Chorus (Yung Joc)
