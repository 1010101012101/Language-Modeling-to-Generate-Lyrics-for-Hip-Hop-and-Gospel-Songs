(CHORUS X2) Marques Houston 
 It ain't nothin' like the first time 
 I'm tryna tell you I can blow ya mind 
 Baby if I touch you here or kiss you there 
 Gonna fall in love shorty, ya best beware 
 (Verse one) 
 This ain't no love song 
 More like a cut song 
 You say your day was long, well tell daddy what's wrong 
 Imma tell you one time -- just relax and unwind 
 Whisper sweet nothin's now you blushing, chills down your spine 
 Oh yeah you hot and temptin' 
 Oh no not pretty ricky 
 But when you grind on me 
 Imma leave you hot and drippin 
 Slip in those satin sheets 
 Now go and roll over 
 Oh yeah its up and down motions like a rollercoaster 
 I sees you up on top 
 You all on my jock 
 Imma do it nonstop, until your cherry pop 
 Imma keep goin' and goin', the energizer bunn 
 (CHORUS X2) Marques Houston 
 It ain't nothin' like the first time 
 I'm tryna tell you I can blow ya mind 
 Baby if I touch you here or kiss you there 
 Gonna fall in love shorty, ya best beware 
 (Verse two) 
 Wont you let me introduce ya to thug karmasutra 
 This ain't no lovey dovey (nah) but watch how I seduce ya 
 Girl I'm the man, i- i- I'm the man 
 I push the right buttons and the sex on demand 
 Oh yeah I like it slow 
 Baby be easy 
 Ooh, watch ya teeth 
 Baby be easy 
 Tell me your biggest secrets, tell me all the dirt 
 You smell like peaches, must bath and body works 
 Love the way your body work, imma make your body rock 
 Once you climax, you feel the aftershock 
 (I know I got you hooked on this lovin' 
 Don't get it twisted, we just cutin' baby) 
 (CHORUS X2) Marques Houston 
 It ain't nothin' like the first time 
 I'm tryna tell you I can blow ya mind 
 Baby if I touch you here or kiss you there 
 Gonna fall in love shorty, ya best beware 
 (Verse three) 
 Yeah I know I know, I still yo lips is so soft 
 But I gotta go, lets hit the shower baby, its time to rinse off 
 I'll wash yours, you wash mine, I adore it the first time 
 I blew yours, you blew mines, sometimes I'll drop you a line 
 But look don't tell nobody, just keep it on the low 
 Not your best friend, not your cousin, nobodys gotta know 
 I know it sounds crazy, but that's just how it is 
 Yung J-O-C, long live, long live 
 (CHORUS X2) Marques Houston 
 It ain't nothin' like the first time 
 I'm tryna tell you I can blow ya mind 
 Baby if I touch you here or kiss you there 
 Gonna fall in love shorty, ya best beware
