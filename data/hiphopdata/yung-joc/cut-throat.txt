 I'm coming straight for your neck dawg, 
 Razor blade hecklered and cocked, 
 In California niggas back on the block, 
 I'm from Compton muthafucka, the city of Gs 
 We ain't got pretty bitches but we got plenty of these 
 All my niggas cut throat, gang bang and cut throat 
 Original bad boys man even Puff know 
 We ain't mad about Pac, we know who did it 
 We just mad that him and Big got crossed in nine senses 
 I was 16 then, little nigga inspired 
 Now me and Joc ridin', homie put that on the wire 
 If hip hop was a building, I'd set it on fire 
 And leave everybody to burn except Mya (haha) 
 Nah, fuck you bitch, I rescue all my niggas first and let em' fuck you bitch 
 On the east coast, them niggas say I'm dumb-hot 
 And when I'm in the south you can just ask Yung Joc

 Eh, I know some edgehangers, zonin till they reach the course 
 Ya dey head banging for less than a brick or so 
 Well acquainted with fiends and even dope addicts 
 My niggas work the triple beams and they dope at it 
 Hey, nigga you don't want no static 
 Holes throw your chest, hard to breathe, like asthmatics 
 Just like Big, tell them niggas, kidnap your kids, 
 Fuck 'em in the ass and throw um over the bridge 
 When I'm on the east, I'm ballin' wit that Jimmy cat (ballin!) 
 Bad bitches everywhere, they all on my Jimmy sack 
 We blowin' sour Ds, hundred fifty packs, 
 I fuck with real Gs, like the Diplomats 
 When I'm in cali, nigga we blow incense 
 Call my nigga Cavi, to smoke away my stress 
 The only coats you'll see locs and dickie suits or molguls 
 Chirp my nigga JTLo in the booths it's ova 
 My niggas cut throat My niggas cut throat 
 I got some killas on the east and the west coast 
 Dem braids on your head, get up hoe, uh get up hoe, uh get up hoe 
 My niggas cut throat My niggas cut throat 
 I got some killas on the east and the west coast 
 They whip game real good, they got the best tho 
 Uh get up hoe, uh get up hoe

 Another one to block (its good) 
 You can meet me in the hood the engine runnin' on my drop (Ferrari shit) 
 And we was just runnin' from the cops (yeah) 
 Cookin coco coco wit the stove or two wonders with the pots (Chef boy R' Jim) 
 I started as a pumper on tha block, (uh huh) 
 Either you slang crack rock or you had that wicked jump shot (swish) 
 Either or, there was no inbetween, (no) 
 It was either be poor or move coke to the fiends (get money) 
 20 it would cost, I was hopin 19 (give it to me cheaper) 
 Tachiney valaws (?) I endulging the team (I was fly) 
 Amongst the murders and plus the burglars (Who else?) 
 The fly willie niggas when they start swerving up (and what) 
 In them fly rides, niggas like the high side, (flossin') 
 Till they go slippin and you catch em' from the blind side (get outta that ride) 
 Tap the glass and you give it to them 9 times (pow pow) 
 He owes some cash but he didn't meet the timer (D O L)

 Dem braids on your head, get up hoe, uh get up hoe, uh get up hoe
