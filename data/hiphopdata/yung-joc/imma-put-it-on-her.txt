 The Girl walks by rocking christian diore 
 We mix it up like juicy lacore 
 I put it on her, time to rock some juicy catore 
 Take a backseat let's do it in the bj 
 Yeah I know that sounds so cliche 
 She outta breathe 'cause we been cutting like a DJ 
 She's on top of me, beneath me is the freeway (ooh) 
 Honey walked up in the club dress lookin' like it's painted on 
 I can tell that she ain't got any panties on 
 Well, baby that's the way that I like it (yeah) 
 And I know she's from the hood 
 The way she drop it so hard 
 Booty bumpin' like the sounds in my car (she should) 
 Let me take it up a notch 
 Get her off the block 
 Take her to my spot and it's on 
 I hope she's ready 
 'Cause she about to get it 
 Like how she move her body 
 So I'm about to hit it 
 Now put it on her (put it on her) (x4) 
 She got me in a daze 
 Thinking 'bout the ways I'ma get her tonight 
 I'ma put her on my stage 
 Let her do her thing 
 Let her play on the mic 
 She got that swagger 
 The way she move it like a pro 
 Love the way she drop and get low (get low) 
 That's why I let her 
 'Cause I gotta get her home 
 Show her how I do when I put it on 
 I hope she's ready 
 'Cause she about to get it 
 Like how she move her body 
 So I'm about to hit it 
 Now put it on her (put it on her) (x4)

 Just say the word I'ma put it on ya 
 You can say you touched the president, Cerock Obama 
 I'm a bad boy and that's what bad boys do 
 Black ice, black coop, black cars too 
 Don't tattoo my name, tattoo my logo 
 Let the whole world know you're fucking with a mogeul 
 You don't need a closet 
 Take you to Taiwain 
 You can have the whole warehouse, ladies Sean John 
 And on the 14th I'll buy the whole island 
 Name it after Champagne and call it Chris Stylin' (Cerock) 
 Yeah, I knew that'd have you smilin' 
 Like Day26 I'll have your ring finger shinin 
 I'ma put it on her 
 I hope she's ready 
 'Cause she about to get it 
 Like how she move her body 
 So I'm about to hit it
