 On ya head leave ya layin where you stand 
 Watch him die slow 
 Then his eyes roll in the 
 Back of his head now his body cold 
 A couple grand, a couple shots, a couple 
 Drip drops now ya leaking won't stop 
 Bitch I'm da man just ask block shots rang 
 Out you can live for a couple blocks 
 Bitch wut's my name call me Yung Joc 
 I got a great aim all I need is one shot 
 Err-body talkin' in my neighborhood 
 I got great lawyers 'cause my paper good 
 Leave ya body riddle, weezin and coughin 
 Here about live Fox 5 with Monica Coffin 
 You fuck wit mine I pause ya life line 
 I'm a graffiti artist paint, chalk outlines 
 And the worst part is I'm not a coward 
 Visit ya wake and give ya mamma dead flowers

 This is not a movie (cut) 
 No re-runs, All sales final, No re-funds, 
 Once I make a payment, the hits out, 
 I'm not Jeezy, I ain't swappin shit out (that's rite) 
 First I tell 'em (what you tell em) 
 Where I want it done 
 In the backyard rite in front of his son 
 Then I tell 'em (what you tell em) 
 Where ta drop 'em off 
 In the Chattahoochee wit his dick chopped off 
 Yeah it sounds harsh but its well deserve 
 Feed his ass to the sharks for ordurves 
 No remorse, No pity, this could happen to you 
 In New Joc City

 But its to late she looking like a maxi pad 
 Bleeding through the dutch tape
