Get like me - DJ Scream ft Yung Joc 
 Just bought a zone, J's on my feet 
 I'm on that patrone so get like me (2x) 
 Er'body love me, I'm so fly 
 Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by 
 Er' er'body love me, I'm so fly 
 Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by 
 Yung Joc: 
 C'mon tell me what it do 
 I do it for the A 
 When the top drop rock the platinum CAR-DEE-AY 
 Got the microsoft, they call me Bill Gates 
 Links around my neck looking like I bill gates 
 I'm Mr. Amacove, yeah I got da pumps 
 Pockets on swoh, looking like they got the mumps 
 I mount my change, gotta get the riches 
 Sprung a look a thangs, y'all gettin' JC pendants 
 Pass that patrone, the limes right thur 
 Rock wit it, lean wit it in my night gurr 
 Wink my eye at your bitch now she wishes she could touch 
 See the J's on my feet as she love the diamond cuts, fresh to death, everyday, like I jump up out the casket 
 Ask chino dollar bout that dope boi magic 
 Connect it like apartments, keep one in the cartridge, chevy seats ostrich, nigga I'm starvin' 
 Lil Boosie: 
 Ok I'm on that patrone, I'm on that dro 
 I'm on a couple pill, don't fuck wit the blow 
 Ya boy style back, miss the zodiac 
 Gotta stay high, rollin' on the sack 
 My niggas in the room, left to the right 
 We rappers on 3, that's the westside 
 Watch us 2 step, throw the head back 
 I'm in the strip club, 'cause that's my trap 
 Y'all better know it, bay da on the hill 
 One in the chamber, 50 on the trail 
 All the hos love me, they best friends like me 
 Popped a couple pills now I got them hos dikin' 
 Hit me on the phone, catch me on the screen 
 14 grands on the purp for the 3 
 Dress to impress, gotta stay fresh 
 Roll wit ya boy and your fuckin' wit the best 
 DJ Scream: 
 Take it to the hand, toss it on back 
 Gimme that patrone we don't want no yack 
 I see u, u see me 
 (Yup) fresh to death from my head to my feet 
 Gotta bad bitch and she gotta bad bitch 
 So when we hit the do' now we got yo bitch 
 Don't get mad, you keep it cool 
 I hang wit them goons and the boyz keep'em too 
 I hussle all day, imagine how I live, stack the big faces throw away dem dollar bills 
 It's like a fairy tale, you can call me robin hood 
 Read from dem suckas and I drop it in the hood 
 Neighborhood trapstar in starbucks 
 Tell me where I go and I leave star strucked
