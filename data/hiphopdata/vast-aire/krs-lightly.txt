Vast: 
 (It's like the day I came home and I was like man, I was listening to the radio and shit, I was like damn ? we gotta do dis shit, yo) 
 Vast Aire (S.A. Smash): 
 I wrote a rhyme to a beat sippin a Sam Adams, 
 Now everybody and their grandma know Atoms, 
 Yo now everybody and their grandma know Atoms, 
 Yo, Now n****s want war like Edwin Star but what is it good for (Absolutely nothing) 
 I'm saying Ice Ice Baby lost [?80 zeros?] 'cause he was (Absolutely frontin) 
 S.A Smash: 
 Cause news been sequel like Van Diesel, 
 I'm in the back of the club smacking up ten people, [ow] 
 I'm in the back with your girl trading them sweet secrets, 
 Rubbing on your honey and getting them t**s leaking, 
 And if I'm to slick for n****s switch to triggers, 
 Shoot me up with fifths of liquor help me out, 
 When I'm out pinch hits the n****s 
 And if the club is stuck on lame, punk, we heat it up 
 And if your girls say she's stuck on brain, we beat it up 
 Cause moves been crackin' since what's happening, 
 How ya gonna push your shit forward when your ass backwards, 
 Attitudes wanna change when the cash stack up, 
 Shoot things when they attack using them black magnums, 
 Listen, n****s are you ready for fun? 
 How you gonna [?fry?] in the house when its heavy with guns, 
 Chop up your body have you rollin' with chunks, n****s 
 S.A Smash (Vast Aire): 
 I wrote a rhyme to a beat sipping a pale bass, 
 Now everybody and they grandma know Smash 
 Now everybody and they grandma know Smash 
 Cause n****s want war like Edwin Star but what is it good for (Absolutely nothing) 
 I'm saying Ice Ice Baby lost [?18 zeros?] 'cause he was (Absolutely frontin) 
 Vast Aire: 
 You know my mouth is New York but my elbows are southern, 
 Comfort, spilt on my shirt change the pattern 
 MC's bettter eat they veggies, 
 I'm four times fantastic, [Unseen] 
 Rock hard and flexible, 
 Plus my flesh is fire suitable, [yo who you rockin' for?] 
 To the cats in the front who be acting ill, 
 And the chicks in the back with the skirts that peel, [Ha Ha] 
 She took it from her index skill, 
 'Cause I was backstage up in her mass and gill, 
 N****s drunk all night looking for skizz to kill, 
 Now we wake up with the morning after pills 
 I think my tongue needs a dancefloor 
 Cause my vernacular is like fancy movement, 
 And if you ever test my crew 
 You might not live that long to dispute it, 
 S.A Smash: 
 Put your money where your mouth is 
 I'll knock your teeth out, 
 We don't play fair yeah's that's the street route 
 What's the beef about life ain't that long, 
 Niggas squeeze 'em out you put it in a rap song, 
 Vast Aire: 
 I wrote a rhyme to a beat sippin a Sam Adams, 
 Now everybody and their grandma know Atoms, 
 Yo now everybody and their grandma know Atoms, 
 Smash [?Ruckas?] Atoms Fam 
 Cause n****s want war like Edwin Star but what is it good for (Absolutely nothing) 
 I'm saying Ice Ice Baby lost [?80 zeros?] 'cause he was (Absolutely frontin)
