(Vast Aire) 
 One three five 
 I'm screaming in your face but you don't hear me tho 
 Gun shed, Rainbow, Harlem Nights 
 Where's my niggas at? 
 Smack you in your face, you crazy? 
 Y'all need to leave that crack alone 
 Leave that crack alone 
 Leave that crack alone 
 Leave that crack alone 
 I can't hear you 
 Y'all niggas is bitch like 
 Can't talk your way out can't even fist fight 
 I think you pressed your luck 
 You better watch yourself the lottery's up 
 Two more cheers then we tip the cup 
 We ending careers tonight, that's what's up 
 What's up Eso, yeah I called you out 
 Its only matters of time before the bitch use out 
 And it's only matters of time till your teeth fall out 
 When you ran back home you lost your clout, Gimme that 
 You shoulda never started shit 
 Now you're in the corner with a bandage kit 
 Plus I know your jelouse of Lif 
 That's why he bounced on y'all, y'all 'ain't doing it 
 He got with some real cats, that's true to this 
 Now your all black-listed, your ruined it 
 I'm a knock y'all down a level 
 Sort of like when Micheal cast down the devil 
 Sort of like when the earth gets reduced to a peble 
 Sort of like when the government defeats the rebel 
 I was there when you begged El to sign you 
 He knew Ox was gonna blow so he didn't sign you 
 Woo, I guess the secrets out 
 Mommy they won't play with us, then go in the house 
 Play time's over, close your mouth 
 Do all your chores and then you go out 
 The closet, and I think it's a walk-in 
 With 7L behind you and he 'ain't even talking 
 I heard your beats on ten, they 'ain't even thumping 
 Cry now cause your castles crumbling 
 And if you heard Dirty Mag, you know they fronting 
 You think we care what you did eight years ago 
 Oh you were on tour with them and so and so 
 Weathermen, we running this shit 
 Likliest one in the chamber and you running your shit 
 What the fuck
