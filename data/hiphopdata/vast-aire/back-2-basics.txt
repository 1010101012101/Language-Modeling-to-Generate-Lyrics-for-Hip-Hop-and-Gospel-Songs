Uh ha. 
 We make regular music 
 What goes up must come down 
 Sorta like balloons when you let go of them 
 Jealous ones wanna knock my style 
 Put a whole in your head and let out the helium 
 I came up with cats who didn't give two shits 
 We grew up in the projects with elevator piss 
 Dad ain't there mums is cranky 
 That's why she comes home yells and spanks me 
 This shit ain't cotton candy and if it is the taste is shady 
 Be all you can be but this ain't the army 
 You will get tossed it will not be gravy 
 New York (Zoo York) 
 I'm in uptown baby now I rest in Brooklyn this city is crazy 
 Buildings fall down that's friction homie 
 Elevate your camp with a bunch of shinobi 
 I'm not lying (I'm not lying) 
 I could form a sword like red and green lion 
 Knowledge is grand like a G in my hand 
 I'm a hustler but I don't cook coke in a pan 
 You know 
 I'm not a rapper I just talk a lot 
 Uh huh 
 I'm not a rapper I just talk a lot 
 What goes up must come down 
 Sorta like balloons when you let go of them 
 Jealous ones wanna knock my style 
 Put a whole in your head and let out he helium 
 And that wouldn't be cool if you called my name 
 Caus you be soft like video games 
 Same shit different day new traulet 
 You got a card on the table I might pull it 
 Texas Holdem watch me fold em' 
 Off the wall but my skin ain't turned white 
 You just entered the chamber of a thousand falls 
 Shit we gon' be here all night 
 Peace to Metro he gave me the insight 
 Me blessing the mic that's my birth right 
 Styles so I'll it'll turn rocks to sand 
 Come a little closer I'll show you unseen hands 
 Son we on our own Pig Latin 
 We be on some Infè Kinpè 
 Now everybody sounds like Jay 
 And everybody loves moving to purple and yay 
 I'm not a rapper I just talk a lot 
 Uh huh 
 I'm not a rapper I just talk a lot
