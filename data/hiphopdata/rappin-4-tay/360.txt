 Hey turn my mic up this a bitch I got my dudes up in this mutha fucka 
 That boy 8ball 4-tay speese-weeze spice-weeze ya smell me? 
 It's e-feeze muthafuckas ain't understandin' the signs of this 
 I cuss a mutha fucka out 
 Niggas gon' be feelin' what I'm revealin' 
 Tryin' to do some healin' an' at the same time make a million 
 Vibrate love an' happiness in this ghetto maze 
 Hate us playaz got this ryhme stayin' in a rage 
 Kill wit a pill broke game like Nintendo 
 Three hours an' forty-four minutes straight to frisco 
 Bumpin' the rappin' 4-tayzee baby 
 Me an' 40 water in the big body Mercedes 
 Four hundred five hundred v-12 black coupe 
 None of my weebles wake that Barkley comin' out the roof 
 Choppin' major game on the strength 
 Man we goes back juss like them splinters an' 'em temps uh 
 Met this bitch that was in Houston said she was from Houston though 
 Said her profession just was stackin' major paper roll 
 First at times it seems gold credit cards we kiss that ass 
 Went from bennies to bossalini's collectin' cash 
 They whistlin' I'm glistin' like Sammy Davis 
 Born an' raised in the bay them hataz can't fade us 
 I am the rapper that they call 4-tay 
 360 degrees they can't fade the yay fool 
 Fuckin' off in the bay wit some crazy niggas 
 Gettin' drunk gettin' high so they saved ya nigga 
 From the bottom of the stream to the top of the mountain 
 In the 'o' straight clownin' talkin' 'bout what's goin' down 
 An' these niggas feelin' me soakin' up the love I give 
 Nigga all of us got kids an' only got one life to live 
 But sometimes that shit don't matta 
 Animosity can lead we to ratta-tatta splatta 
 All over shit leavin' tricks motionless 
 Drinkin' blood like I been spittin' fire like kiss 
 The only nigga sick as this behind me 
 Is the gangsta s p I c e 
 (Yeah smell me yo) 
 Five albums in the game 500 benzo in my name 
 Five niggas in a bucket five zig-zags to the brain 
 To the greedy lil' paper I'm on the mtv news 
 I'm havin' slugs fo shistey niggas tryin' ta give me the blues 
 I ain't a muthafucker Italian but my crew run like the mafia 
 8ball 4-tay banks an' 40 water 
 An' me bossalini freddy chico chanelle shit 
 Met a couple of incidents where some niggas tried to kill me 
 Just a part of the game jealous niggas out fo' fame 
 When steady bustin' at me is to give no name 
 But when they runnin' up on this muthafuckin' don 
 They catchin' pieces of shit hot slugs from a nigga 
 That's fresh out on bail 
 Long time comin' baby somewhere off in the hills 
 Me an' 40 waters choppin' it up keep or kill 
 On the real about this underground lifestyle 
 Intoxicated an' always heavily sedated 
 Bank's rocks the beat I grab the mic an' bust 
 Turn into a monster eatin' weak MC's up 
 Smokin' trees up pinnin' hoes knees up 
 Feds wouldn't ease up had to put the keys up 
 Findin' Jesus prayin' fo the weak 
 Hopin' somebody's on they knees prayin' fo' me 
 In the midnight hour somewhere on them drugs 
 In a room full 'o thugs 40' tell 'em how it was 
 They shot my mama's house up back in 1992 
 I keep goin' back an' play possum like I don't know who 
 If I knew who? what? when? where an' how? 
 If I knew back then would I know now? 
 The rap game ain't never gon' be decreasin' 
 The only thing the rap game gon' keep on doin' is increasin' 
 And there will be no over night sensations them 40 8ball mjg 
 Only drip we been layin' it down since trout season 
 Now all of a sudden I look good as Toni Braxton 
 In a white house wit toys of traction 
 Up-percussion ya may wanna take a second look 
 You can find me in the Florida designs book 
 The hall of game is a 420 wit chrome rims all day 
 Parked up on? 
 Shit this ain't none of that only reason I'm doin' a song wit dude 
 An 'em is 'cause I want they region recognize game 
 Game recognize game 
 360 degrees of game talkin' 'bout game talkin' 'bout game 
 360 degrees of game wit hella bomb on the brain 
 360 degrees of game talkin' 'bout game talkin' 'bout game 
 360 degrees of game wit hella bomb on the brain
