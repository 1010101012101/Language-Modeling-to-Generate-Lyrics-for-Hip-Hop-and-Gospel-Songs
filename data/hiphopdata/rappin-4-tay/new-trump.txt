(Feat. Lil Fly) 
 New trump... 
 I'ma kick a hole lot of doze wide open for my kin-folk 
 Just because we back a lot of people, think we're nin-four 
 Maniac, rat attack, take a fat sac and that dope that you're 
 Snatch from the Rappin' 4-tay track 
 And lace it, chasing like it was the Master Glip 
 I had to switch upon all this gang 
 Cause suckers think that the battle 
 Was an on still from the free-style fill 
 Where I'm coming from, because the player life is so real 
 Killers on the straw, from Frisco to the O' 
 Back to Sacramento from Lay-hoe and San-hoe 
 Say litts, have a party and parlay 
 Now we can do it you're way, let's do it my way 
 A place of O.G marve, and gay of in the background 
 Sipping on corniac, illiac, it's goin' down 
 Flip more papper that the envy even touch 
 From the Hammer to Diaffers, that you franked, 
 That you chuked fucked up 
 New Trump, brand new funk 
 Keep the pocket full of California skunk 
 That ninety five shit gon always bump 
 For ninety six we're gon flip the script 
 And break 'em of some new trump 
 New Trump, brand new funk 
 Keep the pocket full of Califoria skunk 
 The moe' screw track gon always bump 
 For ninety six we're gon flip the script 
 And break 'em of some new trump 
 Lil Fly: 
 Trubows, go, Fila head to toe 
 Bossoliny brimmen come that player little fly hoe 
 Ooh, You did know I own the record label 
 Everytime I go to Vegas you can catch me at the crab table 
 Where I be breaking em', shaking em', takeing em', face em' taolin 
 Talking loud, drinking wild, Cali' style profiling 
 Me come on handeling all situations, 
 Takeing edvanitch of my bidness' from my daughters education 
 Kick back relax, counting ten thousands dollar stacks 
 Check my mail box, flip the script, here goes the most scratch 
 Now peep my ladle moma, try to get her skies on 
 Bitch you're broke as hell, so you know you best to speed on 
 Cause you get nothin' less you push em' on the table first 
 Drop your juicy thief or pay on fliesin' for the nine six 
 Giving it true, comeing new, the niggers black folks 
 Young players throw your hands in the air, 
 If you can feel this grove 
 New Trump, brand new funk 
 Keep the pocket full of California skunk 
 That ninety five shit gon always bump 
 For ninety six we're gon flip the script 
 And break 'em of some new trump 
 New Trump, brand new funk 
 Keep the pocket full of Califoria skunk 
 The moe' screw track gon always bump 
 For ninety six we're gon flip the script 
 And break 'em of some new trump 
 What you thought, I couldn't come again 
 With the mainy raw prosection 
 From the badder new jorke 
 To my folks out in Texas 
 I'm countly talking about bread, they say money ain't everything 
 And the hustlars supposted to be get 
 Ima flip, and trip, ill up in some profhet 
 Every player nation wide try to keep a fat pocket 
 On the first of fifteen, everybody try to come up 
 The fed and snitch and sucker dead for try to run up 
 A cumolate pappers kinda lock the dissies 
 Especially for a player to use, to flip and gees, and keys 
 Sucker please, different chock for different folks 
 See, I'm just one of them players who can't stand being broke 
 Gots to come back quick like Mario and Dreddy 
 Tripling up the papper chase, try to keep it feddy 
 Five hundred thousand gold, one million platinum 
 Keep your plats and be check, and best believe Ima keep raping 
 New Trump, brand new funk 
 Keep the pocket full of California skunk 
 That ninety five shit gon always bump 
 For ninety six we're gon flip the script 
 And break 'em of some new trump 
 New Trump, brand new funk 
 Keep the pocket full of Califoria skunk 
 The moe' screw track gon always bump 
 For ninety six we're gon flip the script 
 And break 'em of some new trump
