It's so incredible 
 Yeah, it's the DJ Khaled, Khaled, Khaled 
 I do this for the projects 
 I got the mothafucking gutta on this track 
 I got the projects on this one 
 You have no idea why you started 
 But guess this is your final warning 
 And boy, we don't care who you calling 
 Nothing can save you now 
 Shotta youts will run up in your apartment 
 So unno betta mind where you walking 
 Goddamn man, can to your target 
 Nothing can save you know 
 See you dun push the wrong button 
 And cross the wrong line 
 Stepped on the wrong shoe 
 Muthafucka, it was mine 
 Time and time 
 They get me out the tandem 
 Me are da true, I traded mine in 
 For caveman king 
 You don't wanna fuck with 
 The Southside Gotcha boys 
 Y'all ain't know trill ass niggas 
 Y'all some boxy boys 
 And pull shots on boys 
 Scattered like a roach 
 And put that on the fifth 
 I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach 
 I was raised in the heart of the jungle 
 The belly of the beast 
 And this lick here sweet, I'm so flawed 
 You can put me on the front line 
 Ass back nicks, I don't represent the gun shy 
 Thing about the street life 
 Homie, I live, wear my heart on my sleeve 
 And niggas gotta fear life 
 From the bottom to the top, east to the west 
 All I gotta say is Khaled, nigga we the best 
 You have no idea why you started 
 But guess this is your final warning 
 And boy, we don't care who you calling 
 Nothing can save you now 
 Yo, bdah, bdah, bdah 
 Khaled, go let me see 'em 
 Hand me the fucking clever 
 'Cause I got a fucking fever 
 For all the evil Kinevel people 
 Who try to stunt 
 Call me Danny Glover 
 I'm lethal this ain't no sequel 
 Shoot you people while you sleeping 
 The grim reaper is out to lunch 
 Nothing can save you now 
 Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found 
 And Khaled got my back 
 He gon' shoot a hundred rounds 
 So say hello to death 
 If you ever in my town 
 I came from the eggs of a goddess 
 And the balls of a gigolo 
 All I had was 2 ounces 
 An old Chevy and Figaro 
 Blood shed apart my feet 
 And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep 
 Lord forgive me, I know not a better way 
 And pop has tried to stick me 
 Damn I need some better ye 
 Ring the alarm, tell 'em people come, come 
 Look at what the fuck the Briscgun, yeah 
 It's the final warning 
 Khaled, these niggas talking 
 I'm an orphin 
 And leave a hole in his head 
 Like a dolphin 
 Fuck a hole in one, ain't golfin' 
 I'ma put his whole unit in a coffin 
 'Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket 
 I'ma open his ass off, like suicide doors 
 Any badass niggas, y'all scared of that lake 
 I'ma tell you once don't be scared of the Dre 
 You have no idea why you started 
 But guess this is your final warning 
 And boy, we don't care who your calling 
 Nothing can save you now 
 I'm usually cool, but know I gotta bet back 
 I tried telling ya, ain't wit'cha death threats 
 I let my nigga know, tell 'em go hammer that 
 And it ain't gon' take all day 
 We know where you live at 
 I'll bet ya hide from ya neighbors 
 Keep 'em mad shawty 
 That's how we kill 'em babies 
 Holla Khaled, and tell him I'm on the way now 
 I just had to hit a lick in the A-Town 
 Look at me it's shawty 
 So bossy, and I don't feel like that 
 Can't stop me now, now, now 
 You see what's happening? 
 Big shit dun popped off 
 I'm the best nigga, you can ask Khaled 
 I'm the best nigga 
 You have no idea why you started 
 But guess this is your final warning 
 And boy, we don't care who you're calling 
 Nothing can save you know 
 Shotta youts will run up in your apartment 
 So unno betta mind where you walking 
 Goddamn man, can do your target 
 Nothing can save you know
