 (Verse 1: Krayzie Bone) 
 I told 'em imma get up, get out and get something, 
 But I was a little bitty nothin', in the city thuggin', 
 Neva been a nigga that's eta fucked none less than a hundred percent, 
 The hustle that's in me, my thug mentality 
 Show me what to do to improve my salary, 
 Don't nobody move cause you could be a casualty, 
 One a dem, maybe dey crossed paths with me 
 One nigga left and they thought we was done, 
 Thought they could get rid a' da twist of the tongue, 
 They thought we was finished, but we just beginning, 
 They want me committed, to the murder, onneee 
 Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, competition, ready to die, 
 Opposition, never survive, when I get done, bustin' my rhyme, 
 Imma criminal transformed to a lyrical bad storm, 
 Did I mention my fast flowin, lately its got my cash growin' wit'an ass showin, 
 These niggas can't see Bone, they already know, 
 Came down with a style unfamiliar sound, 
 That's how we kicked in the doo-ooh-oor 
 What it be like, bone thug nigga, 
 Born 'n' bred in the Cleveland street life, 
 And believe we ain't goin' nowhere, 
 We permanent, posted up, like street lights 
 We do it, still get to it, undisputed, who wulda knew it, 
 We still da truest, shrooted, move it, 
 They ain't doin' it like we do it, do it 
 Its bone thug, we them bone thugs 
 Half of this industry swangin from our balls 
 Its bone thugs, mighty bone thugs 
 Bone thug, bone, bone thug 
 (Verse 2: Wish Bone) 
 Nigga tell the truth when you in the booth, 
 You know you think about the blown flow, old hoes 
 And I ain't nice, like boss, so wanna spit chya' mouth, 
 Better gimme that dough you owe, hoes, 
 Where's the respect when you cash a check, huh? 
 We can' break bread, we'll bust ya head, yup 
 I'll do it to the heart, rather leave em' dead, 
 Before my time, but I'm still ahead, 
 Of all y'all, all y'all, 
 Like a nas'y bitch, give'it nigga raw dawg, raw dawg, 
 Any nigga putty, hit it, catchya, sawed off, sawed off 
 And I'm ready, I'm ready, to-go, 
 What it is, nigga bow down, bow down, 
 Nigga show some love, ain't no hoes in ta us 
 We can swing the bus, we can share some blood, 
 Blood blood, blood-blood-blood-blood, blood, 
 Let a nigga loose, I'm a smack em' like I do, do 
 Imma come an see you fuck tha rappin' in da booth, 
 I ain't no studio, nutin, my name in your mouth, 
 And imma show ya something, fuck it 
 It's the first time, double back dumpin 
 Deep in the club, they some suckas, rush em, 
 Get it how they get it, don't let this singin' fool ya, 
 We gets dirty, dirty, dirty, never nervous, nah 
 Ain't no love dem, ain't no love us, 
 Watch ya mouth, or one day them thugstas, yes 
 They will run up on ya, on ya, 
 And that's when it's over, cause 
 We don't play no games, so when we up on ya, 
 Believe we gonna let it rain, rain 
 Its bone thug, we them bone thugs 
 Half of this industry swangin from our balls

 Bone thug, bone, bone thug 
 (Verse 3: Layzie Bone) 
 In the hood, where its good, yeah we get respect, 
 Gonna industry, man us let us bill collect, 
 It's a promise lil homie, no need for threats, 
 We the best in the bidniss, and we breed da nex', 
 Nigga ride with a thug on a Cleveland quest, 
 We really ain't mad at you, clones, 
 You gotta give credit when credit is due, 
 Why wouldn't they give it ta Bone? 
 If you ever gave props to the masta, thanks, 
 Now you thinkin' how a masta thank, 
 Way back in ninety-foe, stage stays closed, 
 We open the door, nigga get that bank, 
 Flip that flow, city ta' city, my niggas is gritty and o boy, 
 Reppin that bone thug, mo' thug, thug line, 
 Hit 'em with one rhyme, they be like, o boy, o boy, 
 Now most of the greatest done did it, 
 And some of the latest done did it, 
 Rest in peace to the B - I - G, 
 Been 13 years and they still fuck with it, 
 Jay-Z done did, it JD done did, it little bow wow did it and killed it, 
 I love when a real nigga do they thang, some wanna plead not guilty, 
 Nigga get filthy, ain't no playa hation, some of y'all niggas in congratulation 
 Got your hand on my dick tryin' ta masterbate it 
 Let me bust in face, since you had to taste it 
 Smash and takin' what's rightfully mine,
