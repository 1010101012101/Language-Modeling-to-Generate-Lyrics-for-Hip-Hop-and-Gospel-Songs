 Ay, DJ Khaled, I'd die for you my nigga 
 So you already know I'd kill for you 
 Boss 
 Diamonds dripping on me, she know who the one 
 Two seaters every season and I just begun 
 Aquafina, she dripping puddles on a sunny day 
 Multi-million dollar plays and that's a hundred ways 
 Fuck a fashion, we could match in my Hermes seats 
 Top down, JFK, I pray he get impeached 
 Say no names, Supreme underwear and like 80 chains 
 Hundred for the rich forever perspective, never change 
 Petty bitches posting niggas like they would win in pictures 
 Evidently, I'm getting richer, tricking seven figures 
 Ain't no difference when you see me or that's on television 
 Chasing a hundred million, baby that's my natural ambition

 I took my life and bossed it up, I took the risk, coin tossed it up 
 I just left work to work some more, I'm still a workaholic 
 I done sacrificed it all, paid the dues and costs 
 Life will test us all, let's see if we true or false 
 I walk up to my fate and stared that shit in the face 
 Hungry for the competition, bitch get on my plate 
 No mercy, no grace, I'm checkin' off my to-do list 
 There's no room off in the schedule, it's only room for improvement 
 And I realized all I ever needed was in me, nigga 
 S on my chest boy so shots can't even pinch me, nigga 
 No substitute for me, but they gon' still tempt me nigga 
 God is in me, that's the only one who can end me nigga 
 And we seen more blessings than a Baptist Ebenezer 
 My daddy says "you got a good girl she's a keeper" 
 Boy, I'm a Caesar, I see shit and seize it 
 Roc-A-Fella chain, but you can still get Ethered 
 Yeah, they don't really fucking feel me man 
 But when you really run it they try and clip your Achilles 
 I'm on track to a billi', I got Khaled fuckin' with me 
 That mean I got the Holy Key and got the key to the city 
 (Lil nigga)
