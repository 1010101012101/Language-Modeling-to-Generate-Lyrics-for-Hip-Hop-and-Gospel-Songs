Wa guan Mista Khaled 
 What you want today, the regular? 
 Nah, give me the steamed fish 
 With some white rice 
 And give me a champagne cola 
 And give me some water with some lemon on it 
 You feel me? 
 All right there, no problem 
 So what your friend want? 
 Nah I'm good 
 All right then, me soon come back 
 So check this out right 
 It's all about the money 
 It's always about the power 
 It's always about the respect 
 Straight up 
 I don't see 'em 
 Yo Khaled der be some thugs out to the pre 
 I don't know if you want me get dem out side 
 I pray 
 Hey yo check this out right 
 You tell 'em to come through bring them to me 
 And let them know they have a choice 
 Everyone has a choice 
 Heard them people seeking problems with the Godfather 
 Shockers keep them llama get your head trauma 
 Pussy boys rather see me dead, mama 
 Instead I'm in that Maybach I texting William Roberts 
 Riding through the city with my hammer close 
 Pray to Allah that this trigger's not his last result 
 Self made all it took was faith and lots of hope 
 Understand this the realest shit I ever wrote 
 Arab from the middle east Jerusalem 
 Duplicate me will never be I'm hot as Lucifer 
 Palestine mastermind, Rollie face, bezels shine 
 Smoking good, counting paper, tryin' to dodge the Babylon 
 Yeah, I'm well respected and that's on any block 
 Talk about the gutter you just pray to make it out 
 Puffing ganja with them wassels with them dreadlocks 
 Cracking lots with them mobsters get your dog shot 
 I'm fucking molding, foreign without an owner 
 Motherfucking neighbours bought the whole corner 
 Bought the whole block, stuntin' on you fuck boys 
 We the best of all, gotta get that young boy 
 Gotta let me get 'em 
 Nah Ace, they don't want war 
 Just let me get 'em 
 Nah Ace, they don't want war 
 I got 'em, I got 'em 
 Nah Ace, they don't want war 
 'Cause that's that shit we came for 
 Steamed fish was amazing, matter of fact 
 Let me get some jerk chicken to go 
 Grabbed me one of them lemon pie theories 
 And let me get some of them cash you theories too 
 And give me another champaingne cola 
 But let me ask you a question 
 What happened to them people asking about me 
 You supposed to bring them to me 
 Dey no sai mistar Khaled 
 Dey say me one thang one dat you 
 It let those take their next chance 
 And dem boi just 
 And just cut, gone, cut 
 Hahahaha, I always told my dogs everyone got a choice 
 Everyone, kiss the ring
