(T-Pain - Chorus) 
 All I Do is win win win no matter what 
 Got money on mind I can never get enough 
 Whenever me and Khaled do the remix 
 Everybody hands go up 
 (Ey, showtime) 
 And they stay there 
 And they say yeah 
 And they stay there 
 Up down, up down, 
 Cause all I do is win win win 
 And if you goin' in put your hands in the air make 'em stay there... 
 (Verse 1 - DJ Khaled) 
 Sittin' on the top floor 
 What you think I'm hot for 
 Every summer drop more 
 Hits to make my stock go (up) 
 Them hands go (up) 
 Them fans go (up) 
 I'm number one in this bitch and I'ma (stay there) 
 We the best of the best 
 Grind while you haters asleep 
 I'm yelling free weezy 
 I rep the heart of the streets 
 Who hotter than me (Khaled) 
 I'm wearing the crown (we can't stop, won't stop) 
 Go hate on me now 
 (Verse 2 - Rick Ross) 
 I can never get enough when it comes to gettin' fetti 
 Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti 
 Mario Andretti, money coming fast 
 My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass 
 I can never be a racist 
 Wake up every morning just to count white faces 
 Neo in the matrix, glorious as Morpheus 
 Employed all warriors I mean as a scorpion 
 Dr Kavorkian 
 (Verse 3 - Busta Rhymes) 
 Fire and brimstone 
 Yo, every time I come we got another nigga come and get a lot of money 
 When I'm in the building and I promise that there ain't no mothafucker money better better better better 
 Ah ha, ok 
 Niggas know I got it when I hit ya with the pidda padder 
 Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter chatter 
 Niggas know there ain't nobody badder badder badder badder 
 I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut 
 So sick when I come hit 'em in the gut 
 You will crown me king (no matter what) 
 Ok lets shine my friend 
 Get up on my grind again 
 Some niggas should be happy that I chose to rhyme with them, cause... 
 (Verse 4 - Diddy) 
 Hey turn me up man, I want them to hear me 
 Ayo check this out, 
 My heart racing like she snort cocaine 
 I got a billion reasons you should know my whole name 
 Got the most paper, Mr New York times 
 I'm a natural born winner nigga New York mines 
 Everybody getting money but I cop the first 6 
 Now I run the game so I toss the first pitch 
 Yeah I let you wife her but she still my first bitch 
 Less than 9 digits nigga that ain't fucking rich muthafucker 
 (Verse 5 - Nicki Minaj) 
 Ayo, all I do is win ain't that the reason that you really mad 
 Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad 
 I ain't mad Ma, I see you on your bummy swag 
 I'm in that money green Jag lot of money bags, 
 I told Khaled that you the best but I'm the bestest 
 Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist 
 You can talk slick all the way down to the welfare 
 As the IRS bitch I'm paying for your healthcare 
 (Verse 6 - Fabolous) 
 Look I'ma make this here official 
 Let me clear some issues 
 First off I am not for Britney Spears initials 
 That's no BS at your request 
 Lean back you and your crew Fat Joe TS 
 Yeah it's young funeral 
 Hard black on me 
 So act like summers over and fall back homie 
 Winning is all I do, I'll answer all of you 
 But y'all ain't saying shit like prank callers do 
 (Verse 7 - Jadakiss) 
 Yo, it's already proven I got them birds moving 
 All I do is win I'm allergic to losing 
 Yeah, yellow gold cuban, 9 mil ruger 
 I show you what to do with em 
 Finish em, I'm through with them 
 They gon have to jump me, this gon take a few of them 
 They don't want no problems 
 They might end up sueing them 
 Disassociate yourself have nothing to do with them 
 We already got a check we tryna get two of them 
 (Verse 8 - Fat Joe) 
 Just blew trial, crack lots like is little Italy 
 Your wife she a screamer yelling slow down Joe you killing me 
 Beat her like a prize fight mommy I'm a rude boy 
 You just hit the powerball 
 Everyday a new toy, nigga it's a stick up 
 A muthafucking robbery 
 I done did some things that have Haitian Jack proud of me 
 Riding through Harlem me and Jeezy pardon me 
 Puffy surfin on the hood for niggas that keep doubting me
