DJ Khaled 
 I'm for real about this shit 
 This the remix (Welcome to my hood) 
 Let's go (Where the hood at?) 
 Remix (Where the hood at?) 
 Remix (Where the hood at?) 
 Remix 
 T-Pain 
 (Welcome to my hood) 
 Everybody know everybody 
 And if I got it everybody got it, ugh 
 (Welcome to my hood) 
 Look at all these old school Chevys (YMCMB) 
 24s so you know we roll heavy 
 (Welcome to my hood) 
 Where they get fly like a G6 
 And everybody know this is the remix 
 (Welcome to my hood) 
 (Miami-Dade County, bling on fire) 
 Them boys will put you down on your knees (We the Best music) 
 (Woop, woop) That's the sound of the police in my hood 
 (Luda) 
 Ludacris 
 Everybody on the corner with the work 
 Slinging and banging in front of that liquor store (Oh) 
 Blowing money because I live life fast 
 But this bottle full of yak, I'ma sip it slow (Oh) 
 Singles double when triple beams take over 
 Now holla 'cause these Impalas got extreme makeovers (Woo) 
 Couches covered in plastic, babies all in the streets, now 
 Wear the wrong color and catch a Rodney King beat down 
 Kids hit with switches, mamas is quoting scriptures 
 While Luda's getting head, mo' gums than baby pictures (Woo) 
 Cock my 40 Glock, and my partner just bought a replica 
 Now Asians sayin' they don't keep no cash in they register (Hurry up an' buy!) 
 We run from red and blue lights to get the green 
 But whoever got that white is winning like Charlie Sheen 
 T-Pain 
 Teddy Pain, Teddy Pain, bad man, bad man 
 Make shots, boom, boom, boom, boom, bang 
 Man we the best never the less 
 You know we get it hot 
 Fire flame, fire, fire flame 
 Put me on the track and I'm a really let a motherfucker feel it 
 When I do it, how I do it, what I do (Do) 
 If a nigga really want to test (Come and test) 
 You can bet that I'm a eat them all day (Fuck food) 
 850 what I represent, Tallahome, Florida president 
 Me and DJ Khaled got these haters looking hesitant 
 So keep all that wackness out my ear 
 (Phew, phew) That's the sound of your career in my hood 
 Busta Rhymes 
 I hope you niggas got your ringside seats 
 'Cause it's whoop ass season 
 (Coming to a hood near you) 
 Everybody know what happen when you see me coming (Blacka!) 
 I be hurdling and got you regurgitatin' 
 And murdering everything, gun shots 
 Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah (Y'all know what it is) 
 I'm coming to get it and others are blocking 
 I'm runnin' the hood and nothin' can top it 
 You can Google it and you can search it 
 On how a nigga come and unlock it, impossible to stop it 
 (More fire, thunder, pain) 
 I go and heed the villain, he's adrenaline poppin' 
 Need a medical situation 
 Because the way I'm fuckin' everythin' until I'm peepin' it 
 Why you trying to do what you already know that I'm the king wit' it 
 And, you don't want to come behind me wit' it bro 
 Ugh, I killed this shit, I ain't got to rhyme no more 
 (Welcome to my hood) 
 Twista 
 Welcome to my hood 
 Where poor members of faculty backing me 
 If you ever try attacking me, that could be when I eat them 
 Especially when I beat them 
 When they see a bunch of killers and hustlers on the side of me 
 I'm an anomaly to them, put them on crutches 
 We'll sock your lip first for you touch us 
 He one that's kicking our brothers 
 Much as I smoke the duchess and model chicks that cut us 
 And motherfuckers that love us 
 Their enemies want to touch us 
 I'ma spit a flow as if it was a sin 
 Then the gangsters are resting forever 
 See a solid four, then I'm a put it on the fin 
 Then you know to never test, it'll be a 'Category F5' 
 Handle military with automatic weapon so let's ride 
 Love to the honeys, and everybody that running the north 
 And they whole city from the Westside 
 Mavado 
 Welcome to the gully 
 Whe we nuh tek bad up big spliff 
 Inna mi hand and Hennessey inna mi cup 
 Yuh see the gal dem wi ve up is like sum angel 
 Abducted dem fat and grad up 
 Yuh a here mi when yuh pass the gate 
 Written at the entrance, violate 
 A straight death sentence, to live 
 Yuh must be great to be a snake 
 No repentance, we coming at yuh with vengeance 
 DJ Khaled 
 Never slippin', I'm ballin', Puff keep on calling 
 I don't see none of you pussies 
 Fuck that shit, you be talkin' 
 Rep Miami the ghettos (Dade County) 
 Every hood and the projects 
 And when I drop off my singles 
 I'm droppin' one of my targets 
 Lord forgive me for my sins, I gave you hits 
 I gave you "All I Do Is Win" (I won't stop) 
 I live this shit and We the Best, it's no pretend 
 (I'm for real about this) 
 I touch a million, throwing hundreds in this bitch 
 (Yeah, swag job, let's get it) 
 Birdman 
 Real nigga number one (Yeah) 
 Hustle fly with my son (Yeah) 
 Come from uptown, G5, Tommy gun (Tommy gun) 
 Red flag everyday, hundred mill' ready to spray (Ready to spray) 
 Swagged out nigga, Bugatti with the paper plates 
 Blowin' on some good nigga (On some good nigga) 
 Feelin' good nigga (Feelin' good nigga) 
 Stunner Island, me and Khaled on the wood nigga (On the wood nigga) 
 You understand? Shinin' like I know we should 
 Birdman, YMCMB, you know we good nigga 
 Ace Hood 
 Ace Hood in this bitch hoe, kickin' down in your front door 
 Knock, knock, you hear the Glock cockin' 
 And that thing pop on the .44 
 Posted on that same block 
 I'm in the drop top with that bank roll 
 Young nigga, I'm out here 
 Can't name a place I can't go 
 Riding 'round with my fifty grand 
 And they wonder what do that safe hold 
 Middle finger them feds 
 And that's what I pledge a part of my G-code 
 And fuck them prosecutors, hustler connoisseur 
 It's We the Best Forever 
 Make sure you spread the rumor, bitch 
 Fat Joe 
 Good coke, hard rock, stashed in the body shop 
 Only way to break them bricks down is karate chops 
 Niggas gettin' left right in front of the Marble Precinct 
 Leave them like them Jordans, red dot, leakin' 
 I'm fifteen when I first started copping pies 
 You forty six just turnin' blood, stop at five 
 It's like the only way to make it is supplyin' things 
 Hoop dreams, dunkin' over cars, let the choir sing 
 The Game 
 Yo, it's that black raw, black dog, pullin' up on that black home 
 Compton that's my backyard 
 That's where I used to get them sacks off 
 But now I got platinum plaques in the back of the back 
 And I'm back with Dre again 
 Aftermath, We the Best, me and Khaled, Dre and Em 
 Detox, 'Red', that's back to the back 
 Step in the club with my hat to the back 
 Nigga I'm so hood even though I'm livin' good 
 Niggas still in VIP strapped with a gat 
 Drop a couple stacks then it back to the trap 
 Couple hoes in the back, red wheels on the 'Lac 
 Red rum, if you try it, niggas Westside, throw it up, now 
 Jadakiss 
 They knockin' packs off (Off) 
 They lettin' gats off (Off) 
 Medicate, benefit cards, scratch offs 
 Savin' every dime (Yeah) 
 Tryin' to choke a quarter 
 And they ain't sellin' crack, nah, they selling coke and water 
 Smoking or you're snortin', they coppin' all the Jordans (Yeah) 
 Nothings more important, steal them if you can't afford them (Yep) 
 I'm getting to the money (Money) 
 I need another comma 
 Some of them love the drama 
 More than they love they mama 
 (Welcome to my hood) 
 Bun B 
 Welcome to the land of the trill 
 Where everybody walking with they hand on the steel 
 And a model is a supply and demand any will 
 You went out of line with the wrong man then get killed 
 When you damned if you will, damned if you won't 
 A lot of dudes saying that they can but they don't 
 A lot of boys saying that they G's and they ain't 
 Mess around, get laid down in the paint 
 Better do what you say, and say what you do 
 For I come around your hood, broad day with the crew 
 They got them fists, ARs, AKs and them twos 
 And they will gladiate all day, what it do? (What it do?) 
 R.I.P. to the trillest that did it, to my G's on lockdown 
 That quit it, think I'm a stop repping PAT, forget it 
 Waka Flocka Flame 
 Waka Flocka, Waka Flocka 
 Welcome to Clayton County, my house got surrounded 
 The enemies trying to drown me, but my hood still around me 
 Rookie of the year, no freshman cover 
 Shawty sixteen years old, with four baby mothers 
 First rapper ever to jump off the stage on BET 
 And since Pac go to Hollywood to keep it street 
 First rule to put T-Watches on the TV 
 Everyday it's a party on Grove Street 
 DJ Khaled 
 We the best forever
