I'm on my way 
 This goin' out to every 'hood 
 We gon' make it 
 You can look into my eyes, see that I'm dead tired 
 6 in the morning, money still on my mind 
 So if you want it, I'm the one to supply 
 Be there in no time, no time, no time 
 I'm on my way, I'm on my way 
 I'm on my way, I'm on my way 
 I'm on my way, I'm on my way 
 Nigga this legendary, no ordinary shit 
 No ordinary bitches, no ordinary wimps 
 I'm for biznik, I'm special like the 30 
 I came a long way from food stamps and Section 8 
 Niggas eatin' on these beats, get yourself a plate 
 And I'ma step away, one hit a breath away 
 When you don't got time, you ain't never late 
 Come so victory is here, we can celebrate 
 Okay, I'm on my grizzle, on my grind 
 Go ahead try, top my shine 
 I'm on my way, any day 
 Tell them niggas better have my cake 
 What you think? Nigga you ain't 
 Had me laughin' all the way to the bank 
 L O L, A M B, O R at the gini, baby 
 Had to chop the top off that bitch 
 Just so they can see me baby 
 Money I get, know that shit 
 Yeah he paid, notice it 
 Sleepin', who? No can do 
 Motivation, ocean view 
 How I get it? Bitch, you trippin' 
 Ain't got nothin' to do with you 
 You can look into my eyes, see that I'm dead tired 
 6 in the morning, money still on my mind 
 So if you want it, I'm the one to supply 
 Be there in no time, no time, no time 
 I'm on my way, I'm on my way 
 I'm on my way, I'm on my way 
 I'm on my way, I'm on my way 
 Victory is on the way 
 Khaled go in on 'em 
 Show 'em we gonna win, homey 
 Get off in they skin homey 
 I've been gettin' it in the streets over ten years 
 So you think a nigga a pussy cause his ear's pierced? 
 One up on a nigga if you want to 
 You gotta best, gotta be sure that it go through 
 BallGreezy gettin' money like he 'posed to 
 Good dope in the drop like soul food 
 Big Body, big rims on the old school 
 Stay fly like a hood nigga 'posed to 
 Lights off, click clack in the Pinto 
 Seat back, dick sucked in the Benzo 
 5% DBs on the Renzo 
 No sleep, gotta eat, gotta get done 
 It's like I always say, muthafucker here I come 
 Another victory for the crib, a couple more before I'm done 
 And if you sleep, you better wake up, and get on your fuckin' job 
 'Cause I'm takin' everything except for loss 
 Iceberg goes off, yeah 24-7, night goes on 
 And I be scared I might miss money, so I won't doze off 
 I'ma snap, and the streets know it, Trick told me keep goin' 
 And I'ma keep chiefin' as long as God keep the weed growin' 
 You can look into my eyes, see that I'm dead tired 
 6 in the morning, money still on my mind 
 So if you want it, I'm the one to supply 
 Be there in no time, no time, no time 
 I'm on my way, I'm on my way 
 I'm on my way, I'm on my way 
 I'm on my way, I'm on my way 
 Switch man been too official, I've been destined to shine 
 Won't take no for an answer, fuck, nigga, gimme mine 
 Never been selfish for real, I put on my whole city 
 I went from standing on corners to autographin' titties 
 My daddy gave my Virginia's King, a Richmond legend 
 A wise speaker, a woman pleaser, broke nigga, reverend 
 Mr O-10, I get it in, I wear the crown 
 We the best, tell 'em fuck next, I got down 
 You got the cash, then show me, better not be phony 
 Get on my level, 'cause they way below me 
 You ballin'? Baloney, girls ask me what my cologne is 
 Steal khakis and Coronas, and I'm mackin' a donkey 
 Flip the four in a half, do the 'vert, and I left 
 Bet the Ave never seen bags chunky as that 
 Why you got pressure? 'Cause my Impala got pressure 
 Beating outside, shaking the dice on my dresser 
 Is that Gunplay? Yes sir 
 I'm on my way, I'm on my way 
 I'm on my way, I'm on my way 
 I'm on my way, I'm on my way 
 Yes, I'm on my way, all the way to the top 
 But I comin' from the bottom 
 You right here ain't go no brain 
 Uh-uh, can't stop 'em 
 Headin' to the floor, I'm ridin' 
 Where the money keep most supplyin' 
 You can tell I'm stickin' like a muthafucker by the way I'm vibing 
 Just came back from where I was 
 On my way somewhere else next 
 Lightening wrapped up in around my bankroll make my money spent 
 You can check up over here, check up over there 
 Spent my hustle everywhere 
 I'm high-head grindin', gettin' it 
 I'm everywhere, you're never there 
 It's Young Cash, I rap and I sing, nigga 
 Still a goon, I rap under you rappers for your chain, nigga 
 Fuck the alcohol, I'm the one they playin', nigga 
 Black is the attire when I roll up with that thang, nigga 
 I'm ridin' flow, but I don't wanna move in quarter keys 
 I come from Texas, if you're Georgia just to fuck with me 
 Gimme your order, buy them more then, dog, I guarantee 
 That you gon' leave with some whitest lines ever released to T 
 You can look into my eyes, see that I'm dead tired 
 6 in the morning, money still on my mind 
 So if you want it, I'm the one to supply 
 Be there in no time, no time, no time 
 I'm on my way
