(Feat. Jay-Z, Kanye West & T-Pain) 
 Jay-Z: 
 I'm a bad M-a-r-c-y P-r-o-j-e-c-t 
 Ain't no other mother ****** in the rap game harder than me 
 I go hard and get it in like a porn star 
 Follow my moves you wanna make it to the top I'm on star 
 For new born stars 
 Even when the camera stop 
 I'm a hundred million dollar movie handle my cock 
 Big homie from the back block 
 When you first learn how to slap box 
 Then you even learn how to chill with the pill 
 Or handle the pot bring it back rock 
 Number one rule if you *** get popped 
 Don't cheddar box to the matlocks 
 Death before dishonor I'm a honor the code they created 
 Number 2 ruined it and it might sound rude but yep **** you paid me 
 I drown my pain in porsches 
 I lost my partner to the bullshit 
 Still tryna hold on to my religion so 
 I put a couple diamonds in the crosses 
 Close your eyes see the darkness 
 That's what it's like where I'm from 
 No lawyers no doctors 
 So either I go the hardest 
 Or I could just call this a night 
 On dark nights it's like I see better 
 On Dark Knights I'm like Heath Ledger 
 Even if I overdose on drugs 
 Motherfuckers can't kill my buzz 
 Wait I ain't done 
 I'm a freestyle this Khaled let it run 
 What's the hardest county in the Yayo 
 'Cause I'm a go harder then they go 
 I'm a go harder than Baltimore 
 Philly gone say they can't touch the boy 
 Where you at Duval? 
 I'm a go harder than you all 
 Harder than New York 
 Turn the pro tunes in the booth off 
 I'm a go harder than Ye go 
 And Ye go hard 
 That's baby bro 
 Put some more beat on that joint 
 If you could you would get rid of me 
 What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard 
 But I won't let you get to me 
 You should already figure I'm a go hard 
 If you were as real as me 
 You would never let another nigga step in yo yard 
 Makin' money ain't shit to me 
 This in my veins and it gets to my heart 
 So I am, I will, I gots to go 
 You got another way to live you gots to go on 
 I am gettin' it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard 
 Kanye West: 
 I ain't ever been scurred 
 Never been a type to bite my words 
 When I came up y'all gave me shit 
 Now I'm gunna make y'all eat them terds 
 Always said what the fuck I felt 
 Gon head spit that murder I wrote 
 Man I don't care what what you felt fuck you nigga I know I'm dope 
 Dope like I'm comin' to get my all 
 Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall 
 Felt like niggas was stuntin on me 
 Funny how I'm flyer then them all 
 Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now 
 Instead of me she gon go down 
 Maybe I would of slowed down if I knew what I know now 
 I'm scooby I know I'm dumb 
 It cud get fuckin' old but it's good I'm young 
 But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from 
 Tell me what it take to be numba one 
 I guess it's gon be what it's gon be 
 But heres one thing y'all got to hear 
 I'm a tell you like george bush told me 
 Fuck y'all niggas I'm out of here 
 If you could you would get rid of me 
 What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard 
 But I won't let you get to me 
 You should already figure I'm a go hard 
 If you were as real as me 
 You would never let another nigga step in yo yard 
 Makin' money ain't shit to me 
 This in my veins and it gets to my heart 
 So I am, I will, I gots to go 
 You got another way to live you gots to go on 
 I am gettin' it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard
