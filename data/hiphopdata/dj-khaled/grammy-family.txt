(Chorus: Kanye) 
 Oh it can't Be 
 G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family 
 Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry 
 Now I'm hoppin out the limo or either the Lam B 
 But you niggaz gon' get in till you get to Miami 
 (Kanye West) 
 GLC gon be stoned as Angie 
 I be Don C, Johnny Patron, and me 
 It's a celebration bitches more bottles of cham-p-aign 
 In love with the same stripper that sprung T-Pain 
 And all this Louis Vuitton shit ain't cheap mayn 
 Dawg I can't keep sayin' G.O.O.D music the greatest latest 
 Stuntin out the middle of nowhere like Vegas 
 From the chi the city of hella haters 
 Where we keep rising to the top like elevators 
 Hi haters I'm back of hiatus I feel just like you I mean even I hate us 
 Turn the radio down I mean every song 
 Yeezy got a vision that's clearer than Evian 
 Used to hit the radio them faggots ain't let me on 
 Until Khaled turned up the volume 
 Hit the club wit it come on homie they wildin 
 Nas done told you come on homie we major 
 Really Doe told you hoes where we staying 
 G.O.O.D music up in this bitch now quit playing 
 Dawg it can't be 
 G.O.O.D. music the Grammy family 
 A little bit a stuntin flickin dawg it ain't deep 
 I'm only trying to spend what they claim you can't keep 
 Before you die so I make sure I stay on the Chi side 
 Like Lakeshore Drive, The Grammy Family 
 (Consequence) 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 Ghea uh, uh it's the Cons fool... word 
 Oh it can't Be 
 G.O.O.D. music my Grammy family 
 Used to bump the demo up outta the Camry 
 Now I'm hoppin out the limo or either the Lam B 
 And after music meetings wit evenings with Angie 
 It's gon' prolly add a joint that got John Legend and me 
 And we, be in Miami 
 So when they spot me in Bentley it's gon be a stampede 
 'Cause we be racing Bentleys no different than Grand Prix's 
 Fam please, don't make my man squeeze 
 And we can take it to the cars and I'll show you the hand speed 
 I started independent with owners from land speed 
 But now they recognize the way they did for Sam Sneed 
 And sense I got my shot like I was call and man b 
 I hope they lose they spot guarantee a plan B 
 We'll be waiting in the telli like Jamie and Fancy 
 Prolly paintin they nails in nothin' but they panties 
 And we'll be up town Jimmy and Camby 
 Headin to the game to watch Kenyon and Camby 
 They can't breathe or hardly catch they next breath 
 And I know my nigga Ye told you we was the best dressed 
 I know I got a buzz so plan up the next step 
 So what y'all wanna do when it comes to that next check 
 And bet Quence and Khaled know what the business is 
 So open up them envelopes you know who the winners is 
 Please report any inappropriat comments to us 
 (John Legend) 
 La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La 
 On Grammy night call it G.O.O.D. family night 
 Celebrate tonight 
 Oh it's all right, it's all right... yeah
