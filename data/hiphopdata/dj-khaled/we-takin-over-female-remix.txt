 Trina: 
 Yes! I am the queen. feed me diamonds. I donât need a king 
 A couple mill, work the bling, plus my backshot mean 
 And iâm fresh out the coop, I'm bouta kill the scene! 
 Blah!chicks get back! the baddest chick back! 
 And imma make it real hard fa yaw to come back! 
 I'm flya than the sky!new coup wit the top back! 
 Damn! imma bad chick, but y'all already know that! 
 And, I'm undeffeated. 
 Blowin' kisses at you haters 'cause I'm miami heated! 
 Tired of playin' wit you lames 
 I'm shuttin down the game 
 Hope you had alot of fun, wit ya lil bit of bank 
 Beat the drum, blow the horn 
 For the queen of the south 
 Heres a new luis bag for you to shut yo mouth! 
 Roll out the red carpet! 
 Bring the trumpets out! 
 'Cause the word on the street says I own the south! 
 Lil mo: 
 If you really want it, baby you got it 
 We got the fire, you been waitin for 
 Only done did it, but watch how we get it! 
 You can't keep a strong woman down for long 
 'Cause we takin' ova

 Don't even try to hate 
 Wish a nigga would! I'm still hood

 Jackie-o: 
 Jackie-o, jack, jack the rippa 
 Big spenda, showin love to the strippers 
 Time fa a zippa, sang the song 
 Can't be a queen if you ain't gotta throne 
 I hear you knockin' but nobodies home 
 You peakin through ma window 
 Sittin' in yo window, I'm gone 
 I'm in the fast lane, on any corner 
 And I'm breakin the crack game 
 You know keep it real b! 
 Hoods feel me! one false move?! 
 Take ya out ya misery! 
 I give 'em more bounce to the ounce! 
 Wish on things they can't even pronounce. 
 I talk leisure, I know where the hands be 
 H2 and I'm blowin' trees like yancy 
 Detroit brick sanders, queen of rap! 
 Say my name, ill blow you off the map! 
 Lil mo: 
 'Cause we takin' ova 
 All of ma ladiez

 Wish a nigga would! I'm still hood 
 Damn right! 
 'Cause we takin' ova! 
 Remy ma: 
 I am that bitch! 
 Stunt on niggaz! stunt on chicks! 
 I like to smoke 
 I need some crip 
 I got hoes 
 I need a strip 
 I got coke 
 I need a flip 
 Why sell o's when I got brick? 
 I jus get the door, don't even touch the shit! 
 And if I blaze? always the purple pill 
 See the girl how I sets it on fire 
 I write more than giggles writer 
 Ma you're not hard, your vagina 
 Your bone thug, you're not a fighter 
 Mic check, my check, your provider 
 You memorize well 
 You're a good reciter. 
 See, the clock ticks and now it's my time-a 
 I'm the best female rhyma! 
 Lil mo: 
 If you really want it, baby you got it 
 We got the fire, you been waitin for 
 Only done did it, but watch how we get it! 
 You can't keep a strong woman down for long 
 'Cause we takin' ova 
 All of ma ladiez 
 'Cause we takin' ova 
 It'll be crazy 
 We takin' over 
 Don't even try to hate 
 Wish a nigga would! I'm still hood 
 Damn right!
