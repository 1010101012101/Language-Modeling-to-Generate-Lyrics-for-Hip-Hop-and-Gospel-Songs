 We the best!

 We the best! 
 This the remix! 
 The I'm so hood remix!

 I'm so Hood 
 Remix 
 I wear my pants below my waist (we always gonna be the best) 
 And I never dance when I'm in this place 
 Because you and your man is planning to hate (I run this man) 
 I'm so hood 
 And I got these gold up in my mouth 
 If you get closer to my house 
 Then you'll know what I'm talking about (I make hit records this is what I do) 
 (I'm of the) hood (This the remix) 
 And if you feel me put your hands up Hood (put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up) 
 My hood niggas can you feel me (I gave you we taking over) 
 I'm so hood 
 And It you're not from here you can walk it out 
 If You don't know what I'm talking about 
 I'm so Hood (hey young jeezy) 
 (You got me we run this man we run this) 
 Verse 1 Young Jeezy 
 I'm so h to the double-o d 
 I run this god damn money on me 
 Pocket so fat it don't make no sense 
 Whips so clean don't need no tints 
 Watch so bright I don't need no light 
 And no where word don't need no might 
 Niggas like Young what you get for a show 
 Tell'em same thing I used to get for the blow 
 Sit 'em on the row nigga what I got to lose 
 Put 'em in the vans I ain't talking about his shoes 
 Do the speed limit nigga watch out for the lights 
 Pussy ass niggas gotta watch out for the dikes 
 Seventeen five yeah nigga I said it 
 Seventeen five yeah nigga I'm in it 
 And when we do it bad and when we do it good 
 I'm so I'm so I'm so mother fucking hood (Luda, Luda) 
 Verse 2 Ludacris 
 Everyone come equipped with bangers 
 Throwing up our middle fingers 
 And you know I don't slip so I gotta keep ten in the clip and one in the chambers 
 Better be walking with angels 
 And never take candy from strangers 
 Luda's stressed in stripe had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals 
 I'm in the zone homes going for the two point conversion 
 I'm so hood that Ludacris should have been on the original version 
 But this is the remix 
 For the cheap tricks 
 Hitting sweet licks 
 And I cut the braids off put the waves and the fade that will make you sea sick 
 See this is the way that we ball 
 And this is the way we brawl 
 So put a fist in the air if you care 
 United we stand divided we fall 
 When the south is in the house you better watch yo mouth 
 'Cause we on that hood shit, I'm hood rich 
 Coming around your hood bitch 
 Chorus T-Pain (Busta Rhymes) 
 I'm so hood (remix) 
 And if you feel me put your hands up 
 Hood 
 My hood niggas can you feel me I'm so hood 
 And if you ain't from here you can walk it out (the king of the streets and the god of the hood) 
 You ain't hood if you don't know what I'm talking about (Busta bust bitches) 
 I'm so hood 
 Verse 3 Busta Rhymes 
 See all the niggas that want to get and get my money 
 Again and again 
 Top down 
 Let the money blow in the wind 
 The bad bitch sitting in the passenger seat 
 With the dooby wrapped head full of bobby pins 
 You know I keep that thing when I walk see the dialect 
 Different from the slang of my talk 
 Maybe still even gotta crackhead frontin' out another bad bitch that will 
 Boost for the spot 
 I'm used to leaving the strip last 
 Hustling until the sun comes up getting cash 
 So much bread in all of my four pockets 
 It looks like a nigga got hips with an ass 
 And from the DNA in my blood 
 Niggas idolize me 
 Trying to do what I does 
 And if the other nigga ain't really from the hood 
 You can easily die 
 Tell who the fake nigga was 
 And even though I split a little rap 
 Got Niggas in the hood trying to sell the most crack 
 Violating my city nigga to do it just to make you spend a lot of money just to get your shit back 
 Y'all niggas know where I'm from 
 And I rep it to the fullest until the day that I'm done 
 So hood where we live if a nigga sold drugs any rich mamma still proud of her son 
 Verse 4 Big Boi 
 Daddy fat sacks 
 So hood like the Cadillac 
 On the mint on from the bambalance 
 Call an ambulance 
 To come and pick that ass up because a nigga never had a chance 
 They tryin' to dance with a devil in the pale moonlight 
 Advance on the level that they can't do right 
 Lay hands on a fellow like a man and blue lights 
 Woop, woop 
 Do it twice 
 Your boy the B - I - G 
 I'm nicer than MC in your top three 
 You cocky, I cock squeeze 
 Bust them things now you sloppy 
 Speed it up slow it down then screw it 
 Don't bite the flow because I got that blew it 
 Run through the crew or some whole other new shit 
 Newness bitch we do this 
 Chorus T-Pain (Lil Wayne) 
 I'm so hood (remix) 
 And if you feel me put your hands up 
 Hood 
 My hood niggas can you feel me I'm so hood 
 And if you ain't from here you can walk it out (up out) 
 You ain't hood if you don't know what I'm talking about (Weezy) 
 I'm so hood 
 Verse 5 Lil Wayne 
 I'm so Holly Grove, New Orleans 
 Lil Weezy Ana 
 Home sweet home depot 
 You will need a hammer 
 It go down like fraiser 
 I ain't talking Kelsey grammar 
 I be shitting on your boys I need an alka seltzer sandwich 
 Since I heard Plies I done brought the phantom back 
 Went and got me a 52 inch Maybach 
 I'm eating like a big dog 
 I'm so full, I'm so good 
 I'm so straight, you so fake 
 I'm so real, I'm so hood 
 Verse 6 Fat Joe 
 Yeah nigga 
 Welcome to the crack house 
 I should own a McDonald's 
 The way I bring the macs out 
 I'm from the hood where every nigga lies 
 Flip a couple grams they tell you they baking pies shit 
 Still got my name carved in that central booking 
 Gave that pussy a scar and told her good looking 
 Yous a crack baby that means your momma paid me 
 You can't even blame it that's what the hood made me 
 Verse 7 Baby 
 Martin Luther King 
 Calio, Magnolia, Melphamine 
 Gettin' that money with a triple beam 
 Ride that choir or drugged a fiend 
 Saints is my team that's what we brief nigga 
 That's how we eat 
 Get this money on the streets nigga 
 VL my street blood 
 Five Star G blood 
 Fly as a bird 
 Got these eagles on my seat blood 
 Then head back where I stay 
 Third ward we get that cake 
 Thirteen is where I lay 
 Shots off to MIA 
 Verse 8 Rick Ross 
 More money more problems 
 Don't call me conceited 
 Just call me the boss 
 Always got what you needed 
 MIA you're so hot 
 But my neck got the fever 
 If you sneeze you get shot 
 Gun play makin' believers 
 I just bought me a ranch 
 Watch a hundred stacks 
 No those ain't Rolex diamonds 
 What you done to that 
 You fools from gazing 
 My fools from Haiti 
 I move some daily 
 It's a movie baby 
 Hood
