The season has returned, DJ Khaled 
 We global now, we global 
 We international now 
 International, Nasir 
 Money fall out the sky when I speak 
 Gotta valet, can't leave mine in these streets 
 Can't carpool, the crew is too deep 
 Why tuck it all in? The jewels are too sweet 
 You should ball if you could 
 I be diggin' in my pockets, it ain't trickin' if you got it 
 And since a nigga from the projects 
 Champagne out of a can would be the fly shit 
 And I'm a history major 
 Hood motivational speaker 
 Rap Led Zeppelin, best dressed list 
 Show you how to bubble off of large investments 
 Ya heard me and this journey, I'm the journalist 
 Line around the block to hear the words of the herbalist 
 Send ya girl to the Dominicans to perm her shit 
 Tell her tonight, we gonna see Nas return to his murder shit 
 It's still nasty, bone in the flesh 
 God's son, never gone, never left 
 King, I play every card in the deck 
 The whole world waitin' for what I'ma do next 
 And y'all already know where I came from 
 Queensbridge reppin' since day one 
 Nigga I'm on 
 (Come on) 
 I'm on 
 (Come on) 
 I'm on 
 (Come on) 
 I'm on 
 (Nasir) 
 Come on 
 Out of the shadows, into the light 
 I have the power to take back what's mine 
 (Can't hide, can't hide) 
 We have the power 
 (Alive, it's so fine to be alive) 
 We are the light 
 I'm God's hit man, Chopard wristband 
 New York crown jewel, no if-and's 
 Top five, I'm the one, two, three, four and the fifth man 
 Smoke a hookah in Istanbul, I'm quicksand 
 I'm 5 Mics, five points of light, hit the stage like a meteorite 
 They wanna all hear Ether tonight 
 But we ain't beefin' tonight that's history 
 So now when you mention me say I'm a mystery 
 Like six degrees or the seven hills of Sicily I need a vasectomy 
 They resurrected me but nothing is left for me 
 Just when you thought you'd seen the best of me 
 I take it a notch higher, yeah, sip more wine than a Somalian 
 Get around town in a private lear and by sun down I'm up out of here 
 It's still nasty, bone in the flesh 
 God's son, never gone, never left 
 King, I play every card in the deck 
 The whole world waitin' for what I'ma do next 
 And y'all already know where I came from 
 Queensbridge reppin' since day one 
 Nigga I'm on 
 (Come on) 
 I'm on 
 (Come on) 
 I'm on 
 (Come on) 
 I'm on 
 (Nasir) 
 Come on 
 Out of the shadows, into the light 
 I have the power to take back what's mine 
 (Can't hide, can't hide) 
 We have the power 
 (Alive, it's so fine to be alive) 
 We are the light 
 Power, paper, palace is so high 
 Lookin' over skyscrapers, wildin' out in Dubai 
 Do I look like I never seen the better things? 
 Emerald ring, I chase cheddar mean 
 Pockets on swole since eighteen years old 
 Gettin' my dough, cigars are hand-rolled 
 From Guantanamo, Gallardo's, the car shows 
 The Narcos, Gestapos, Optimos 
 'Cause I love the dough more than you know 
 Still ain't reach the pinnacle 
 Braveheart general since 9-4 
 Got the belt to show certified classic 
 9-6, Street Dreams was blastin' 
 And no way they wanna hire assassins, they still harassin' 
 I'm so platinum, it's natural 
 A nigga is my acronym, lights, camera, actionin' 
 It's still nasty, bone in the flesh 
 God's son, never gone, never left 
 King, I play every card in the deck 
 The whole world waitin' for what I'ma do next 
 And y'all already know where I came from 
 Queensbridge reppin' since day one 
 Nigga I'm on 
 (Come on) 
 I'm on 
 (Come on) 
 I'm on 
 (Come on) 
 I'm on 
 (Nasir) 
 Come on 
 Out of the shadows, into the light 
 I have the power to take back what's mine 
 (Can't hide, can't hide) 
 We have the power 
 (Alive, it's so fine to be alive) 
 We are the light 
 Nigga I'm on 
 I'm on, come on 
 This is 
 We global now, we global 
 We international now, international 
 Nasir
