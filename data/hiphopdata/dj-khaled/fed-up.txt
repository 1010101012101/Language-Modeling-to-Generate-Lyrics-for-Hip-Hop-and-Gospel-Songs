Usher: 
 It was all a dream 
 Yeah homie I'm on my job 
 And you can't take that away from me 
 Yeah I got my team 
 And I got all of my niggas behind me 
 And they give me the love I need 
 Yeah I got my foot in the door 
 Still hustling for more 
 Checking the game 
 Yeah I'm back in the light 
 Yeah I'm fed up 
 Hey I'm fed up 
 Hey I'm fed up 
 I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired 
 Young Jeezy: 
 I am absolutely positively on my grizzy 
 Even though I'm sick of them tired, I gets busy 
 Started 62, what ended up a frisbee 
 And me, I like to stand at the stove until I'm dizzy 
 Ball so hard it's like I brought the game with me 
 Left my glove, so why you thought I brought Jermaine with me? 
 'Bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me 
 I give it all up before I let the fame get me 
 I got niggas tryin' to sue me, bitches tryin' to do me 
 Way these niggas actin' you'd have though they never knew me (Young) 
 But these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me 
 I'm fed up, it's why I'm acting like the ol' me 
 Usher: 
 It was all a dream 
 Yeah homie I'm on my job 
 And you can't take that away from me

 And I got all of my niggas behind me 
 And they give me the love I need 
 Yeah I got my foot in the door 
 Still hustling for more

 Yeah I'm fed up 
 Hey I'm fed up 
 Hey I'm fed up 
 I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired 
 Rick Ross: 
 I'm sick and tired of you suckahs so now I'm fed up (Ross) 
 Somebody catch the chain; I'm 'bout to tear his head off 
 Shawty bendin' over knowin' I'm 'bout to tear it up 
 Before you let your top back, get your bread up 
 Made history, but now we claiming victory 
 Get ya out da white house; go back to your efficiency 
 Suckahs finny and I know you haters hear me 
 Like the IRS, you wonder what I'm makin'; yearly! 
 With them brown bags, circulate so why I perpetrate 
 We shinin' than the bottom 'cause we're down to twerkulate 
 Lookin' at the parking lot; better get your mind right 
 Oh, you better be broke 'cause the time's right 
 Usher:

 Drake: 
 Uh, me and Wayne was gettin' high on 'em 
 He leaned over and told just don't retire on 'em 
 And when they give ya they shoulders, never cry on 'em 
 And when they love you to death, never die on 'em 
 And the question still remains 
 Have I counted all the money that I managed to obtain? 
 Niggas dedicating overtime to damaging my name 
 And somehow I'm still the hottest, muthafuckah in the game 
 Usher: 
 Yeah I've been in this been breaking records since '94 
 So I ain't gotta brag about records that I've brought 
 Records that I hold 
 Records that I've sold 
 Man I'm fed up with these niggas, believe in my lingo 
 Yeah, don't bite the hand of your provider 
 You say that I ain't influence you; you a liar 
 I'm on fire; you used to light up 
 You're gonna wake up and realize- 
 It was all a dream 
 Yeah homie I'm on my job 
 And you can't take that away from me 
 Yeah I got my team 
 And I got all of my niggas behind me 
 And they give me the love I need 
 Yeah I got my foot in the door 
 Still hustling for more 
 Checking the game 
 Yeah I'm back in the light 
 Yeah I'm fed up 
 Hey I'm fed up 
 Hey I'm fed up 
 I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired
