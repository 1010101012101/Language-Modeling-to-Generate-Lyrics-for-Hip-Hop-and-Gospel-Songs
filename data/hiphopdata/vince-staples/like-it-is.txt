I tell it like it is, then how it could be 
 Heaven or hell boy, freedom or jail boy 
 A Jansport bag full of shit I could sell for 
 The higher, the low boy, just me and my homeboys 
 The police kill us so we made up our own laws 
 Been fighting this long war, there's shells in this shores sand 
 Still young but a grown man, could tell by my stash 
 Been stackin' money and problems as I wait for the rapture 
 Death never been no threat, I be chillin', relaxin' 
 Everybody bleed 
 I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one 
 To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done 
 I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one 
 To make my momma proud, feel like her only son 
 I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one 
 With everything I need, with everything I want 
 I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one 
 To do it like nobody has ever done 
 When I was in seventh grade my grandfather told me don't get caught 
 Lovin' the streets 'cause they never gonna love you back 
 But I feel like it's all we got so it's all we really do love 
 At the end of the day I feel like the problem is the people that control 
 It don't really come from here, so they can't do nothing but look down on us 
 We look at them, we see somebody that could help 
 But they look at us and all they see is a nigga 
 It don't really matter anyway, we all gon' die one day man, one day 
 Do doves cry when the black man dies, or do we croak with crows 
 The young catch gun shots, the old catch the holy ghost 
 Ho I love not, I never seen no pot of gold 
 Just ball windows and six fours with no switches 
 Was broke with no bitches, she love me though 
 You'll kill me if it make you richer, what you screaming, you my brother for 
 Heart is where the hatred is, the brain that stained the love below 
 And life is what you make it so I'm makin' money for my folks 
 I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one 
 To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done 
 I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one 
 To make my momma proud, feel like her only son 
 I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one 
 With everything I need, with everything I want 
 I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one 
 To do it like nobody has ever done 
 When most people look at a person who does what I 
 Do they look at us with these preconceived notions as if 
 It's a set way for us all to be, but we all people at the end 
 Of the day so I wonder why we don't treat each other like it 
 You're looking at a person telling them that they story don't 
 Matter when they're no better than me, walkin' down the streets tryna shoot at somebody 
 'Cause all we got is these dreams man and y'all ain't never had to not have nothing 
 And that's the last thing you want from anybody 
 Is to not really have nothing 
 I been through hell and back, I seen my momma cry 
 Seen my father hit the crack then hit the set to flip a sack 
 I done seen my homies die then went on rides to kill 'em back 
 So how you say you feel me when you never had to get through that? 
 We live for they amusement like they view us from behind the glass 
 No matter what we grow into, we never gonna escape our past 
 So in this cage they made for me, exactly where you find me at 
 Whether it's my time to leave or not, I never turn my back 
 I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one 
 To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done 
 I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one 
 To make my momma proud, feel like her only son 
 I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one 
 With everything I need, with everything I want 
 I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one 
 To do it like nobody has ever done
