(Bong Hit) 
 So I guess I'll smoke 
 So I guess I (coughs) 
 So I guess I smoke 
 This yo town, I'm only in it for the night though 
 I'm tryna feel right though 
 Slow down, what you think about a drink? 
 Mix it with a little bit of sprite though 
 Ain't you on tour with Dizzy Wright though? 
 Nigga roll something 
 You mean to tell you around all these bomb ass trees 
 And you don't smoke nothing? (smoke) 
 Fuck it, bad bitch wanna hit the blunt 
 Don't mind if I do first 
 Cool verse, this some new work 
 Left the hotel, hit the show, goddamn it was too turnt (turnt) 
 Crew shirt that's WTF, yo bitch wanna wear that shit to bed 
 And then we got her smoking, I ain't joking 
 The way that she started blowing, it's only gon' make a nigga want some head 
 So I'll guess I smoke 
 So I guess I'll smoke 
 I guess I'll smoke 
 Smoke, so I guess I'll smoke 
 So I guess I... 
 Smoke, smoke, smoke 
 So I guess I... 
 Smoke, smoke, smoke 
 Blunt, after blunt, after blunt 
 After blunt, after blunt 
 After that, then another 
 Chilling with my niggas and my brothers 
 Couple bitches say they with it 
 Probably gonna have them under covers 
 Yeah they all smoke 
 Hit up Cole, tell him that we need some more 
 Already got CÃ®roc and the honey jack, little bit of fireball 
 We picking up the papers at the store 
 I got it for the low, that's free shit (free shit) 
 Fans wanna see me get the tree lit 
 Probably eat up all the sweet shit 
 Now I'm writing all this deep shit 
 Hit up AKT, damage every single beat quick 
 Straight THC 
 Now we mobbin' in the car, that's a MIC 
 Step to the line and take hits like the MLB 
 Let the beat drop while I smoke this weed 
 We smoke a lot of weed dog 
 Like a whole lot of weed 
 Back off tour like what 
 Give it up for the new kids 
 Nigga I ain't tryna be the new Wiz 
 I'm just tryna do it like Snoop did 
 Too clever, whenever, however illegal 
 When I'm smoking pot up in the parking lot 
 Hit a lap around the world 
 Just to land in Amsterdam and 
 Smoke a blunt up in a coffee shop 
 You ain't ever smoke like me nigga 
 You don't want to see who get the highest (Nigga why you lying?) 
 Nigga you'll probably get the itis 
 I just got my marijuana license 
 She with me, she standing you up 
 They say I smoke like I'm at the cannabis cup 
 Stand on your luck and get handed your face 
 On a platter with candles and stuff 
 Y'all niggas standing on the sideline 
 XXL Fresh, now I headed for the cover of the motherfucking High Times 
 Pregame before a headline, but 
 It's bedtime for all of these kids 
 Off that wax niggas know what it is 
 She hopped out that cab just to hop on the dab 
 And I'm grabbing the torch and she grabbing my dick 
 Let us smoke 
 So I guess I'll smoke 
 I guess I'll smoke 
 Smoke, so I guess I'll smoke 
 So I guess I... 
 Smoke, smoke, smoke 
 So I guess I... 
 Smoke, smoke, smoke 
 Puff, puff, puff, puff, puff, puff 
 Pass it to the side 
 Let your uncle get a drag of that 
 And puff puff give 
 Man I need it for my cataracts 
 Old nigga, cold nigga, bold enough to hit the dab 
 And Yabba Dabba, Scooby Snack 
 And little niggas doobie cracking 
 I'll be blowing till the day that croak 
 I got nothing else to do so I guess I'll smoke 
 Today and everyday after today I'll be 
 Smoking forever and that ain't no joke 
 I ain't even really mean to impede 
 But talking all the bad bitches and 
 All the best weed 
 Catch these keys 
 She my speed 
 I'm bout to go get it 
 Nigga it's OG 
 All I had to say was, "Buddha Lova" 
 Mo' Thug soldier, and she came closer 
 Blew a couple shotguns, boy I keep a hot one 
 Bad to the bone, hit the bong 
 And we got gone 
 Seeing so futuristic 
 Weed got me dizzy 
 Hahahaa
