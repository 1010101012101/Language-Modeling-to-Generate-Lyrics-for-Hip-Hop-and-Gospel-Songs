Independent, sold out shows, and I don't think that's changing! 
 My fans say they wanna see me turn it up, and I can't leave y'all hangin' 
 Bout that life, who came to see me rock this crowd? Damn, I must be famous 
 Came so far and it feels so amazing, and now we dealing with a new generation

 Niggas getting live in the back 
 The left side of the map, got niggas tryna do rap 
 Been around the whole world once and I'm back 
 And I'm plottin' on how to do laps (yup) 
 Dropped and see how they react 
 Even though it's world peace until the whole world collapse 
 And now we dealing with a generation gap 
 No commercial, I'm a little too thug for that 
 But it's turnt up season to the max, straight out the trap 
 Get it jumping for show, pay ten racks for a show 
 Reminiscent on the days when I used to come for the low 
 Came up, now I'm finna blow 
 Shit, my feelings the fuel to my rocket 
 I won a million before you know I got it 
 She got a man but she gonna drop it, she so out of pocket! 
 I'm on my grind and I'm tired, they blaze with us to get higher 
 These Vegas niggas on fire, now these promoters throw us on flights 
 Was it make them tell, if you step to a king 
 Man, you brave as hell, who gon' try it? 
 You niggas late as hell 
 My bitch booty look like K. Michelle, and I'm feeling this fire! 
 That these

 You niggas confused, and I noticed it 
 So I stay in my lane while I'm rolling it 
 It's a shame, you fuck with my older shit 
 Well, the world can't see who I been growing with 
 I've came so far, niggas can't even get over it 
 No way no one is ignoring it 
 So move it, my homies in foreign countries 
 Found the weed before we went exploring it 
 This talent is what I was born with 
 Took about twenty years before I was touring it 
 Do you like it? 'Cause it's the first time you done heard it 
 Just wait till you see me performing it 
 I'm so live on the stage 'cause I smoke and I rage 
 And I jump on the crowd like I'm Method Man 
 So I'm puffin and rapping my verse on they hands 
 So high I hope that I never land 
 See a lot of niggas that I'm better than 
 In my FV letterman, on a plane 
 Headed somewhere I ain't never been 
 Always on the move, I don't settle in 
 Coming for the mother fucking throne (Yiggity Yuh) 
 In a crazy city known to let the devil in 
 Every time he knock knock knock, girls let him in 
 Gotta dumb it down to stay two steps ahead of them, call me competitive 
 But I still got what you was trying to be, a clone 
 Now I'm pulling up the-
