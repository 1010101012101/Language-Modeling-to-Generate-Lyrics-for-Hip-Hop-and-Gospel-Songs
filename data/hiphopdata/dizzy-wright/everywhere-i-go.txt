Right back on top of things 
 Blowing up without dropping names 
 And I'm lifted 
 Locked the game but if I go down the Hopsin lane 
 I guarantee I'll Marshawn Lynch it 
 Y'all ain't ready for the young man 
 Beast Mode like I'm done playin' 
 Heard they feening for the next big thing 
 Shit, well I'm looking like I need to come and fill that position 
 Listen, can't wait for y'all 
 Either I'm finna find a way or I'll make the way 
 People that said that they got me and then they forgot me 
 Guess what 
 Today's the day that imma save the day 
 And you gon' watch because you paved the way 
 The hate make me better 
 Now I'm happy, smoking good and motivated 
 To keep running this city forever 
 I love to rap 
 Dizzy Wright stepping up to bat 
 They hope in fact 
 That nigga strike out 
 But that never will happen they hatin' 
 So I Jackie Robinson them with a smile 
 Ahead of these suckers by miles 
 I told you from jump that that sucker shit wasn't allowed (not allowed) 
 Everywhere I go turn into Vegas 
 Now it's time for y'all to get wild 
 But believe everywhere I go they spread my name, the more that I spread this game 
 I swear everywhere I go, they go insane, roll up the mary jane 
 Everywhere I go turn into Vegas 
 Now it's time for y'all to get wild 
 Stay on it, live life in the moment 
 Or you could just roll up and sit on a cloud 
 I swear it's everywhere I go (go) go (go) 
 Right back on top of things 
 Everywhere I go (go) go (go) 
 Right back on top of things 
 Everywhere I go turn into Vegas 
 Now it's time for y'all to get wild 
 Time for y'all to get wild 
 Time for y'all to get wild 
 I heard they like "Who would have thought Dizzy would even come far" 
 And Pac may not have changed the world, but I'm that state of mind he sparked 
 So let me hit you with the heart to heart, from dark to light 
 I'm headed for my destination 
 Treat me right, I might take you with me 
 If not take the chance of me fucking up your reputation 
 I'm next (refreshing statements) 
 Tell you what you don't wanna hear till your breath is taken 
 Took you down the golden ages with some complications 
 Nigga what more you want? 
 You want a one hit wonder or an artist that got more than one? 
 You need to make up your mind 
 'Cause I'm constantly taking my time 
 You fucking with me, then you leavin' that fake shit behind 
 (Uh-Oh) Bringing the 702 to the building 
 Why they tryna turn the sky into a ceiling 
 These niggas is too in they feelings 
 So I don't want no compliments, I'm dominant 
 It's time for me to start trolling 
 Stoner chicks is so legit, we just line 'em up and go bowling 
 Girls everywhere I go 
 But believe everywhere I go they spread my name, the more that I spread this game 
 I swear everywhere I go, they go insane, roll up the mary jane 
 Everywhere I go turn into Vegas 
 Now it's time for y'all to get wild 
 Stay on it, live life in the moment 
 Or you could just roll up and sit on a cloud 
 I swear it's everywhere I go (go) go (go) 
 Right back on top of things 
 Everywhere I go (go) go (go) 
 Right back on top of things 
 Everywhere I go turn into Vegas 
 Now it's time for y'all to get wild 
 Time for y'all to get wild 
 Time for y'all to get wild 
 Uh, cruising the map, Take out your phone and take a snap 
 Girls always want to do that twerk team shit in my lap 
 And I'm like 
 Go (wild) [x6] 
 'Cause everywhere I go turn into Vegas 
 Now it's time for y'all to get wild 
 Everywhere I go (go) go (go) 
 Right back on top of things 
 Everywhere I go (go) go (go) 
 Right back on top of things 
 Everywhere I go turn into Vegas 
 Now it's time for y'all to get wild 
 Time for y'all to get wild 
 Time for y'all to get wild 
 Wild 
 Time for y'all to get wild 
 Time for y'all to get wild 
 Wild
