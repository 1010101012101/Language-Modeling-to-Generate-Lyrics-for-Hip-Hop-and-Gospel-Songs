Spag... that's what ya called me when I walked into ya car and sat in da back seat. 
 Dressed exactly how I wanted to be seen wouldn't let anyone change me 
 Or be mean. I dressed from head to toe in nuttin but luis colour of snow, 
 Of all da things that you coulda called me, 
 Of all the things that you coulda said, 
 You didn't like me or the way I dressed... 
 You called me a spag. 
 It didn't matter that I'd spent a fortune, 
 It didn't matter that I looked like a queen, 
 You didn't like it didn't want me to be seen... 
 You called me Queen Spag. 
 See through dress by luis vitton glamorous choos and a gucci thong 
 Thought that's what you wanted thought that's what ya liked but little did I know 
 I was in for a bad night. 
 Of all da things that you coulda called me, 
 Of all the things that you coulda said, 
 You didn't like me or the way I dressed... 
 You called me a spag. 
 It didn't matter that I'd spent a fortune, 
 It didn't matter that I looked like a queen, 
 You didn't like it didn't want me to be seen... 
 You called me Queen Spag. 
 Don't care anymore, about what you say... all I do is look for a reason everyday, 
 To act like someone else, to feel really glad, 
 'Cause I hate it when you call me Queen Spag. 
 Of all da things that you coulda called me, 
 Of all the things that you coulda said, 
 You didn't like me or the way I dressed... 
 You called me a spag. 
 It didn't matter that I'd spent a fortune, 
 It didn't matter that I looked like a queen, 
 You didn't like it didn't want me to be seen... 
 You called me Queen Spag.
