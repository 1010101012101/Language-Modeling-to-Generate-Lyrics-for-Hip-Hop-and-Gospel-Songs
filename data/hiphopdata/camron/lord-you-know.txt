 Okay, Dipset, Let's do it y'all 
 (Hook: Jahiem) 
 Now lord you know... just how hard I try, 
 To live my life, and get it rights 
 Trying to see some light, or even better... 
 Way over way a new day, someday 
 Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow 
 It gets better I know, Tell you, I know 
 (Cam'ron) 
 With my muscle you'll be dazzled, but hustlin's a hassle 
 Percuset, Demorel, capsules of paxil 
 Cops wanna cuff you, niggas wanna clap you 
 Bitches might burn you, they runnin' with that clap too 
 But the monster made it, do it for those incarcerated 
 Who had it confiscated, hate it 
 When they take powder, up-state he take showers 
 Baby mom on greyhound for eight hours 
 See her man face to face through a glass 
 On the phone, ten years he got chasin' that cash 
 And he had the game in a smash 
 Fell like the towers when the planes went on crash 
 It wasn't 9/11, but it was 9-1-1 
 Gave him 9 plus 1, dropped a dime on dun 
 I told him get his nine and run 
 Turned himself in I had to find that dumb, that's too long.

 Aye yo them niggas from the 3-2, said I can't breeze through 
 The forty if I cop bottles, we can't believe you 
 Me who? please boo, landin' in that G2 
 Same color as beef stew, favorite letters: GQ 
 That's me, true. peach blue, hebrew 
 Lawyer on my side keep me out of jail the fee stoop, steep whoo 
 But it might lead to, that R2-D2, the mobsters creep through 
 We da new PE, shittin PU 
 To da hood y'all don't need me, I need you 
 Cause my mission's insane, you couldn't vision the pain 
 Always a snitch in the game, what you want, prison or fame? 
 Neither one dun, long as my digits are sane 
 He lookin' frigid, dig it make sure them digits get changed (why?) 
 'Cause I can't be in hell's cell, shout out to Mell' Mel 
 Cash and hell rell, Zeke doin' three, he even fell, hell 
 He comin' home a '07 and 12 cells (I got em') 
 Cause you musta known, I can't trust the phones 
 For the dough you'll be like d'oh, stuck at home 
 (Hook: Jaheim)

 Nowadays dog they raid up in the ballparks 
 Blaze 'em when they cross sharks 
 We raiders of da lost ark 
 I'm like a ballplayer, shake up and cross narcs 
 They get mad when I lay up in the Porsche Box 
 More props, R.I.P. my poor pops 
 Can't see his son shine like the Four Tops 
 My antennas will block the scanners (what else?) 
 I got blammaz you'll drop ya hammers 
 Lawyers to watch lawyers, Cameras to watch cameras 
 Niggas to watch bitches, Nana to watch grandma 
 In pajamas I snuck out to watch santa 
 Now look at killa, you gon' watch santana 
 (Hook till ending)
