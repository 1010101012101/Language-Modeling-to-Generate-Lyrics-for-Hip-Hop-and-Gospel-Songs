 How I get robbed in cali

 Got mobbed in cali 
 Yeah that cali love 
 Come chatter mouth 
 Have my bling black is out 
 Stick me what thatt about

 Beverly Foxhill Roscos swap meet 
 Slausson Crenshaw Compton we not sweet 
 Like I'm chump change 
 Jimmy with his gun game 
 I'm fun aim 
 Lax gun range 
 White load the felly fell 
 Holla at the kid proper 
 If somethin' happen 
 Skip rappin' 
 The'll be big choppas 
 Ghetto byrd word 
 'Cause I keep the big choppas 
 No disrespect 
 Niggaz killed big poppa 
 The williams sista 
 Ro9meo from steve harvey 
 Got the drop 
 Get the drop no please sorry 
 Got weed on me 
 No need guard me 
 I'm what you need probly 
 We teach robbery 
 (Chorus: Jim Jones) 
 We ride in that east side 
 Please roll up my weed high 
 We ride in west side 
 The city were them techs fly 
 That dirty dirty south side 
 Midwest uptop when we outside 
 But we ride in that eastside 
 So please roll up my weed high 
 (Jim Jones) 
 My momma allways told me aim for the sky 
 So I came out aimin bangin' at guys 
 It was mainly slangin kane by the pies 
 And the fiends was payin' for dangerous high 
 O b and amonia we mix it down 
 No sleep on the corner the pitch mound 
 And police when the saw us they frisk us down 
 We all hate marajuwana and coke now 
 So tell bloomberg it's a rezy 
 Take it back to 88 and move byrds though my city 
 Dw bridge new jerz wit the pizy 38 a key for a byrd 
 They get busy 
 Fuck the phone getthe word by mouth 
 When the winter roll around no byrds fly south 
 Fuck the cops got hella folks in prison 
 Hand over the option 
 But the cell codes still livin' 
 (Cam'ron) 
 Dope man 
 Smoke man 
 O's float the boat 
 No coke for sold man though tan 
 Wo man 
 Sell white throw tan tell her (ill holla) 
 Watch the kid from 140 bake 
 They say shorty straight 
 48 grams 
 Turn 4 to 48 
 All I do ignore they jake tell her (ill holler) 
 I still bubble o's 
 Still double o's 
 Still double my double 
 Down in the double o 
 Big pimp in the caddy

 Spingfield

 Cinncinati 
 That's green point 
 Menace with a mean joint 
 Sac town nap town 
 The lou got some mean joints 
 We arangatang it 
 Durange bang it

 Like 'Pac I'm +Gang Related+ (holla)
