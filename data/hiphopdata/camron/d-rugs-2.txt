I'm back on the street wit' heat, oh glorious hood 
 Only two months in, Damn my lawyers good 
 Ten bricks and a body that's lickin' rich 
 Tell the DA, fly fuckin' witnesses 
 Sittin' in the cell, I could just vomit 
 That's word to Elaja Mohammed, became wiser the prophet 
 Gods not I, I time my guy, I don't hate to see the boys 
 (Why)'cause the tapes can be destroyed 
 They on the beat walkin', in my socks searchin me 
 It's not hurtin' me, most cops work for me 
 Yo where Qweed, what up ma huh what 
 Where D at, damn yo we need that 
 Yo yo, my earnin' in question, I'm burnin' and sweatin' 
 You knowin' jail turn me depressant, I ain't learnin my lesson 
 You just a dumb spouse, I ain't gone run him out 
 I know where to find D rugs over Un's house 
 (Talking) 
 Get the Fuck off me, I'm goin' to Un house 
 Get the fuck off me 
 Yo, I knocked on the door, yo yo how it's lookin' Un 
 You seen d rugs, yeah I was cookin him 
 I ran to the kitchen, Oh my God damn look at him 
 What's the problem with him Un, yo he lookin' slim 
 What you ain't feed him right, what's wrong he ain't eatin right 
 You fuckin' wit' him that's why you sneezin' right 
 What you mean duke, wit' d rugs ya ass will get a mean tooth 
 You lookin' like a fiend to 
 But he made me cheddar, I'll take him to the death wit' me 
 He felt the same, so the nigga left wit me 
 Now we back, and dealin' in hoods 
 Reunited and it feel so good 
 Fiends comin' through in fleeces and sweaters, 
 Increasin my cheddar Happy just to see us together 
 Now we round up new click, competition too sick 
 D rugs left blue six, woo shit 
 It's like I'm born to rock on the block, still clockin 
 Me and D rugs hug but they still watchin, Lil hot chick 
 She said man keep them mills poppin', 
 The only way to keep you in they got to kill Cochran 
 But he mixed business and pleasure he get to me 
 And I'm a Geto Boy my mind playin' tricks on me 
 Optional, ay yo he still fuck wit ya moms 
 Naw man that's impossible, Yo I heard she left the hospital 
 So I stepped to 'em both, needless to lie 
 My mother told me naw Cam chill he was prescribed 
 She got to take him twice a day to keep her alive 
 And I'm sittin' here shocked yo, rain don't stop yo 
 What's that the lots yo, who that the cops yo 
 Female Tahoe, connect wit the Brosco 
 Fuck a hard case, I'm from a mob race 
 Why does this fuckin' feel like the end of Scarface 
 I'mma sucha sober, flip d rugs up to smell the odor 
 Told him, he fucked us over 
 Then popped girl, to my mother, told her I love her 
 Plugged her, now only God can judge her 
 Now after this tragedy, d rugs laughed at me 
 He was here way before, and he'll be here after me 
 Now here come the cops and the whole fuckin' calvary 
 Snorted d rugs and had them niggaz blast at me 
 (Gunshots) 
 You can't kill me, I'm a fuckin' killa you can't kill me
