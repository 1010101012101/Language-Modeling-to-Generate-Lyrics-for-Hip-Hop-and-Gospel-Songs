Excuse me 
 Do you take a Afro-American card 
 What's that? black card homie 
 Cam?ron: 
 Cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Cam?ron and Hell Rell: 
 (You got change for a billion) 
 What's that, that's the Lear nigga, leaving outta Tito borough 
 Dipset beats Okero 
 But it's bombs away, do things the monster way 
 We'll take your beauty queen, snatch ya lean, John Brunei 
 But that cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Ransom, Mel Gibson 
 [Yeah, welcome to Hell's kitchen 
 I got one stove, 2 pots, 4 workers, 2 blocks 
 After this I'm buying us all new drops 
 That's right, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Let's go, bling for bling 
 Pay homage to the chain nigga, kiss the ring 
 Damn, we got 'em teary-eyed and heart-broken 
 The Porsche tires burn the rubber, yeah the cars smokin'] 
 Man, lean fast, peel the whip 
 What dealership you dealing with 
 Potangrams, damn, we nothin' you familiar with 
 More killin', killin', what's poppin' 5, the tools out 
 They 550,212, G-mack, pool out 
 Leave 'em layin', stinkin' 
 That's the way I'm thinkin' 
 New York hustlers love me, like I'm David Binkins 
 [That's right cha-ching cha-ching 
 That's my pockets talking 
 Naw, my stomach talking 
 Nigga, we run New York and 
 I'm your favorite boxer, favorites blossom 
 Black Aston Martin, but I made it darker 
 Add on some extra pink, I get extra hate 
 Know how I deal wit' it, I move extra weight 
 Cam'ron: 
 Cha-ching cha ching (We the treasurers) 
 Cha-ching, cha-ching (More cash registers) 
 Cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Cha-ching cha-ching, cha-ching cha-ching 
 Cam'ron and Hell Rell: 
 [Pardon me brother, I'm hard in the gutter 
 Plus I'm packin' all the toast, but you hoggin' the butter 
 Oh yeah, pardon me sister, I slept with her sister 
 And the bitch wasn't all that, I left and I ditched her, stupid 
 That's right, cha-ching cha-ching, spending all them 100s 
 You can be my go-get-man 
 Go get my dutches, go get my luggage, roll it and puff it 
 In that big ass house, I ain't written, I own and I love it] 
 For my grandmother, cops and ronnies 
 Y'all cannot control me 
 You gettin' gwop, good I'm gettin' guacamole 
 I'm the hockey goalie, y'all action foagies 
 Wanna treat me like Billie Joel, rock and roll me 
 'Cause I'm icy ma, Nikes are pricy ma 
 They like me, I'm hyphy, what you in, wifey car 
 Naw, high-pass, that car trash 
 Ain't a quarter million you can kiss our ass 
 Cam'ron and Hell Rell: 
 Cash green, rocks blue, not him, I'm not you 
 The 550,100 thou, get copped too 
 Flattery, battery actually bred 
 Only charger that I'm coppin' when my batteries dead 
 They had to be theirs, gunshots, that'll be lead 
 For yo' ass, funeral beef, that'll be dead 
 They love him, I can read your palm 
 Like baby don't be alarmed 
 Vietnam, Dipset, we the bomb 
 [This is Ruger Rell, I make the hardest music 
 I move that coke, PCP, embalming fluid 
 Ratchet right here, yeah I know how to use it 
 Know what I do when I use it 
 Bring in that funeral music 
 Ruger
