Since they cut my umbilical 
 I knew it would be inevitable, that my case should go federal 
 It's part of my journey, see it might concern me 
 But who Cam best friend? My attorney 
 Can you hold somethin'? Can I throw you some? 
 Now I know you dumb, where I know you from 
 I ain't got it right now but I owe you one 
 In your head, one shot from a loaded gun 
 Don't get extorted, I get escorted 
 To the resorts, where the girls say let's snort it 
 I can import it, export it sports car 
 Let's port it, fresh auto, I report I just bought it 
 I scream let's get it, they ain't pimp my ride 
 But my cars an exhibit, huh? Next critic 
 I don't talk it, I just live it, just prove it 
 Tell the feds calm down, it's just music, man 
 Man you cold frontin', beat you like you stole somethin' 
 Who you talkin' to, I asked you can you hold somethin'? 
 Where I know you from, huh? Where I know you from 
 Where I know you from scrams, where I know you from 
 You got a order shorty, you should learn ring 
 Your baby mom know, we call her sperm bank 
 Crazy hoe, word baby bro 
 Mad generous givin' out falchios 
 A meat eater, Miss Domma Domma 
 Honor my persona, it's like a Parana's momma 
 We move bricks on the highway 
 So there's bricks in my drive way 
 K9 come, then the 9 spray 
 My girl toe ring, that's 55K 
 Crack in 4B, coc in 5A 
 Dope in 8F, the hoe's in 9J 
 What can I say? You know how I play 
 We hustle all night, until the skies gray 
 Why you think the whole hood carotid? 
 He Tony the tiger, yeah, he like it sugar coated 
 Man you cold frontin', beat you like you stole somethin' 
 Who you talkin' to, I asked you can you hold somethin'? 
 Where I know you from, huh? Where I know you from 
 Where I know you from scrams, where I know you from 
 Man you cold frontin', beat you like you stole somethin' 
 Who you talkin' to, I asked you can you hold somethin'? 
 Where I know you from, huh? Where I know you from 
 Where I know you from scrams, where I know you from 
 They got the cameras up, they want to tape a solider 
 'Cause I got that tan, you can call it Beige and Mocha 
 Talkin' in code, is sort of like playin' poker 
 Bring the Pepsi in the oven, that's the bakin' soda 
 What up tiny bum? We were all the sorta 
 Feds gave 'em 25, damn a quarter mortar 
 But we from the same hood where they slaughtered porter 
 You a passer, me I got a scorers aura 
 Owe me money, your wife, son, daughters oughta 
 Leave the country, I'm thinkin' like bora, bora 
 Run around with these silly secrets 
 Tryin' to keep it real, me I'm gon' really keep it 
 You should really peep it, mack milly skeeted 
 In your face, any case, I'm gon' really beat it 
 We ain't never gamble, we ain't never bet 
 Where I know you from scrams, we ain't never met 
 Man you cold frontin', beat you like you stole somethin' 
 Who you talkin' to, I asked you can you hold somethin'? 
 Where I know you from, huh? Where I know you from 
 Where I know you from scrams, where I know you from 
 Man you cold frontin', beat you like you stole somethin' 
 Who you talkin' to, I asked you can you hold somethin'? 
 Where I know you from, huh? Where I know you from 
 Where I know you from scrams, where I know you from 
 Huh?
