There comes a time 
 Every girl has to cry 
 Cry cry baby sometime 
 There comes a time 
 When your heart can't take no more 
 And you have to cry cry cry 
 Listen when it comes to my girl 
 I can tell it all 
 When it come in the home 
 She wanna smell my balls 
 Why it smells like ... 
 If you ain't playing ball 
 Took a shower at the gim 
 Said use a ...on your pants 
 Make up on your shirt 
 Gave some hugs at the office 
 Girls make up the world 
 Ain't imaging what she said 
 'Cause I can smack a ... crack ... 
 Got a beautiful mom 
 The way she's acting bro 
 On my phone 
 When I sleep 
 Trying to crack the code

 Turn around and I said

 Discover undercover that you're jealous on my mother 
 Baby so from here girl I blow a kiss 
 And it's me I know she miss 
 'Cause when I left I told her this

 I walk to the door and said 
 Baby you are my one and no other 
 Discover undercover that you're jealous on my mother 
 Baby so from here girl I blow a kiss 
 And it's me I know she miss 
 'Cause when I left I told her this
