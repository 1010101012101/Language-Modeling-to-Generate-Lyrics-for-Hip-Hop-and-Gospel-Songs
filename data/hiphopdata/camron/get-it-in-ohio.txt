Waddup Midwest? 
 They forgot about the 4th coast, it ain't nuttin' though 
 Waddup Arkansas, Minnesota, Kansas 
 Kentucky, Missouri, everybody in the Lou'? 
 Thinkin' 'bout Guy Fisher 
 Never met him, but goddamn, that's my nigga 
 I figure real estate, invested pie flipper 
 Never snitch, me, I'm in a bathrobe, fly slippers 
 Left Chicago with good money for five drops 
 Westside, did the Southside like the White Sox 
 Vampoo and Pulaski, K-town is contra 
 They'll dearly depart ya in front of MacArthur's 
 I'm the author for gangsters, tough guys 
 Did the whole Ohio, but I started off a Buckeye 
 Columbus to 'Natti, them towns I raped 'em 
 Few clowns was hatin', moved my pounds to Dayton 
 And in Akron, my niggas they would grow things 
 Not King James, these were coke kings 
 And he actin' grown, doggy, you ain't back at home 
 The smack it's on, wrapped in chrome 
 You better get a chaperone 
 If you know like I know, you should lie low 
 Killa, I used to get it in Ohio 
 Don't forget the Chi yo, guns are like a pyro 
 You keep playin', you will look like a gyro 
 Go 'head and hate me hater 'cause I'm flyer than the Aviator 
 Well, you'll get smacked with the radiator 
 And I get catered player, wanna talk? Maybe later 
 Told her, her time was up, '88 her, Flavor Flav'd her 
 Need ya neck choked, rather your neck broke 
 Ya dead broke, yet folks the jewels are like ayo 
 And you'll get yoked up, switchblade poked up 
 Bitch made since 6th grade, he need his rope cut 
 Cowboy roped up, y'all boys sold what? 
 You know what? The dope, crack and coke is in the coat tucked 
 Roll up, hold up, family, this a hold up 
 Get close up, soaked up, I'm KG, post up 
 Hoe, slut, no love, turn beef to cold cuts 
 Family gettin' bread, well, he about to get his loaf cut 
 Y'all stoked up, this game is sewed up 
 Malcolm X, tell the white bitch, yo, I want my toes sucked 
 If you know like I know, you should lie low 
 Killa, I used to get it in Ohio 
 Don't forget the Chi yo, guns are like a pyro 
 You keep playin', you will look like a gyro 
 I'd rather be judged by 12, than carried by 6 
 My 12 12 well, they carried my bricks 
 And them 12 12 fiends they're married to sniff 
 And the V12, that's on various strips 
 Y'all make a brotha laugh, me I took another bath 
 Come into my habitat, hovercrafts, bubble baths 
 Duffle bags stuffed with cash, fell in love with math 
 I got the green Benz, red Range, mustard Jag 
 White coke, tan dope, black gun, trey deuce 
 Silver bullets, purple piff, blue pills, Grey Goose 
 Pull out the ratatat, duck, duck, say goose 
 Badge Coupe, suede roofs, send him off to Jesus 
 H-deuce, yeah, yeah, piss off the state troops 
 See me, then they don't, I disappear, say poof 
 Play Zeus, homeboy get a replaced tooth 
 Not pot, mean dust when a nigga say juice 
 If you know like I know, you should lie low 
 Killa, I used to get it in Ohio 
 Don't forget the Chi yo, guns are like a pyro 
 You keep playin', you will look like a gyro 
 You know what it is, nigga, Harlem 
 140th and Lennox, you faggot niggaz suck a dick, fuck niggaz 
 Everybody in the whole Midwest, Indiana, Nebraska 
 Omaha, what's happenin'? Err'body in Denver, Iowa, Illinois 
 Chi-Town, Ohio, you know what it is, I'll be home soon, killa 
 Milwaukee, Wisconsin, waddup Leche? 
 Yo Happy, I'ma drop another package off 
 Duke on that Westside of Chicago 
 Waddup everybody in Columbus?
