Yo, this flow here is bulimic, anemic, yo, red beam it 
 If I got it on, trust you never seen it, never seen it 
 Some people say I'm conceited but dougie, I never cheated 
 Oh boy, you'll get deleted, believe it, I could achieve it 'cause look 
 I'm on a Yamaha, laughing like ha, ha, ha 
 Na, na, na, want to talk, shots speak ra, ra, ra 
 Crib is like Mardi Gras, no beads, grow weed 
 Court case, courtside, nigga in the nose bleeds 
 OG, Goatee, proceed, whole Ki's 
 Sorta like a janitor, stay within a parameters 
 Niggas got the hammer bra, don't care about a camera 
 'Cause they put that dress off, first like grandmamma 
 Hope you got the stamina because niggas be on worst 
 Blow reefa, no sneaker, thought this was a converse 
 I told baby girl, damn that's a hard purse 
 But you gotta get it in flavors girl, like starburst 
 We counting money, yo doggie, we counting money 
 Yo shit, ain't even funny but look at we counting money 
 Yo, stupid up on the stoope, the game is in a stoope 
 'Cause look we get chalupa, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, chalupa love 
 Winter time, I'm heated why they frigid 
 Lenox ave boy working with 8 digits 
 Summer time came through in our may blizzards 
 Old ladies looking like damn they did it 
 'Cause huh, I got to forty fifth just to get a snack box 
 2 piece, apple pie, feds taking snap shots 
 They know I'm known for hot rims, fast drops 
 Big trucks, big jewels, whys from the have not's 
 Now every pocket on my clothing dawg, have knots 
 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 thousand, jack pot 
 Call my block gravel, it's mad rocks 
 I'm the owner of the team, fuck the mascot 
 Sucking mad cock, 650 rag top 
 Damn, don't get hit with the jab that my dad got 
 Y'all sasquatch, put it on your laptop 
 Yo, not a door but yes sir, it's pad locked 
 We counting money, yo doggie, we counting money 
 Yo shit, ain't even funny but look at we counting money 
 Yo, stupid up on the stoope, the game is in a stoope 
 'Cause look we get chalupa, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, chalupa love 
 Yo, we do the interstate, baby, we're the state patrol 
 With 50 pounds and I ain't talking 'bout an 8 year old 
 It can take a toll, hope that you make parole 
 Play your role, the heat is so hot it can make you cold 
 And they say I'm a son of a bitch 
 Why? 'Cause I be with your son and your bitch 
 You don't deserve her, your fair, we won't hurt her 
 We taught her to be a squirter, your son about murder 
 Your brother well, he my worker, your sister well, she my slurper 
 Your mom, her ass is fat, my niggas they call her bertha 
 Once a week they might server her, with dick they gon' serve her 
 Now she whining like a baby, yo, maybe we'll get her gerber 
 Smack her on her ass, warm milk, then we burp her 
 Yeah, we left her nurtured but we'll earth her, before we chirp her 
 You'll be a punching bag, fam, we'll put our beats on her 
 Or the Klu Klux, yeah, white sheet on her 
 Or Miami jersey, put the heat on her 
 Or a door mat, I'm gone put my feet on her 
 Creep on 'em, leap on 'em, yeah, I park the jeep on 'em 
 Americas most wanted, with no warrant 
 We counting money, yo doggie, we counting money 
 Yo shit, ain't even funny but look at we counting money 
 Yo, stupid up on the stoope, the game is in a stoope 
 'Cause look we get chalupa, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, chalupa love
