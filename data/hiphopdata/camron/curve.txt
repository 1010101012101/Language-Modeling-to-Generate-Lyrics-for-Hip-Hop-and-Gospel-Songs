Na I told shorty to curve, she like curve? I'm like curve 
 She like what that mean, I'm like that mean get away from me 
 Ya breath stink, you heard a tic tacs? 
 Curve man, get outta here 
 Big Pun was alive he'd tell you to go that way, curve 
 From Ecuador, extra raw, repituar, like the reservoir 
 Few Beretta scars, get ya neck ajared 
 Respect ya pa, don't believe, bet a card 
 I need a freak, I mean a tramp ma 
 And my dick you can lick like a stamp uh 
 And ya back, you can arch lick a ramp ma 
 Get a helmet you about to get ram hard 
 I'm Rambo, commando, Camacho 
 You'll disappear, vamanose vato 
 Got doe, gwap, hoes, shots go 
 Ratt, tatt, tatt, how could he not know? 
 Louie socks tho, you can see the logo 
 And I chop, blo, blo, no homo 
 Shoot out in the woods, no po, po 
 He wired the deal a no go yo 
 I get dough tho, he a no show 
 I'm so high, high, in the low, low 
 I ain't got a address but yo I gotta get dressed 
 Come watch a mobster get fresh 
 Linen and Ostrich on deck 
 I know y'all wish that them shots woulda shot me to death 
 But death because me, you a mummy, I'm out to get flesh 
 Dummy money, bustin' outta my socks and my sweats 
 Get cash but alota my gwaps in a check 
 That's my word, if homie actin' absurred 
 And he sorta like a bird then tell tha dude to curve 
 Girls too, if she gettin' on ya nerves and she gota 
 Lotta nerve then tell the girl to curve 
 Curve nigga 
 No curve trick 
 Curve nigga 
 No curve trick 
 Curve nigga 
 No curve trick 
 Curve nigga

 Yo, damn Cam, why they startin' wars? 
 Forced in garden, kitchen, parkay floors 
 Lil' pimps, watch them whores 
 Slide 'em to the crib, right in side her ribs 
 Right outside her ribs, right inside her chips 
 Please stop watchin' me 
 Look, diamonds around her wrist, house behind the cliffs 
 Left her equivalent to 600 dimes of piff 
 Off the winter menu, I'm from a different venue 
 These Nikes, don't ask, discontinued, must miscontinue 
 One clip will end you 
 Please stop watchin' me 
 Yeah, I can't front baby girl, I'm somethin' to watch 
 I ask her one thing, "Girl, you cummin' or not?" 
 I make scrilla melt, you don't need killa help 
 My doors are suicide, bitch, go kill yaself 
 Since you feel yaself, .9 mill to steal ya health 
 Please stop watchin' me 
 Yeah, I know a lotta y'all hatin' wanna clap me still 
 Listen good, I don't care how you actually feel 
 'Cause I'm actually real, for real wrapped in steel 
 And the roof open up like a happy meal 
 Get a steel grip, you won't feel shit 
 We move single file, like we on a field trip 
 Get ya permission slip, can you vision it? 
 Empty the gun son, put in a different clip 
 That's my word, if homie actin' absurred 
 And he sorta like a bird then tell tha dude to curve 
 Girls too, if she gettin' on ya nerves and she gota 
 Lotta nerve then tell the girl to curve 
 Curve nigga 
 No curve trick 
 Curve nigga 
 No curve trick 
 Curve nigga 
 No curve trick 
 Curve nigga 
 No curve trick
