Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you 
 Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you 
 Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you 
 Day dreaming and I'm thinking of you 
 Look at my mind 
 Floating away 
 (Cam'Ron) 
 I know fuckin' with a crook is whack 
 I lied cheated still took me back 
 What I do, turn around, ask you to cook me crack 
 Boost my work with a jerk and tell the truth it hurts 
 Cause you even ask me to come through to church 
 What I do, act second rate 
 I stole ten dollars out of the collection plate 
 But I'm ready to change 
 You got my heart, plus you smart 
 And the sex is great 
 And you hate rap 
 I like that girl 
 I argue with Keisha, I ain't like that girl 
 You jumped, right out the car, to fight that girl 
 You beat her ass, you ain't have to bite that girl 
 And my baby got the best thighs 
 And my whip she ain't never got to test drive 
 Copped here up, at five 
 You paid attention when no one acknowledge me 
 This is my public apology, Holla B 
 (Tiffany) 
 Hey baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, ah 
 Baby, can we 
 {Cam'ron) 
 We can get the drop top or come through on the bike 
 We could go where you want, we could do what you like tonight 
 (Tiffany) 
 Hey baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere, ah 
 Baby, can we 
 {Cam'ron) 
 (Where you wanna go) 
 Where Italy, what Sicily, tell me girl, Disneyworld 
 (Tiffany) 
 He's the kind of guy that would say hey baby, let's get away 
 Lets go some place, oh 
 Where - I don't care 
 He's the kind of guy that will give it everything and trust your heart 
 Share all of your love, till death do you part 
 I wanna be what he wants, when he wants it 
 Whenever he needs it 
 When he's lonesome and feeling love-starved, I'll be there to feed him 
 Loving him a little bit more each day 
 Fears are at hold when I hear him say 
 (Tiffany)

 You helped me work when we was twelve and a half 
 You said Cam, what the fuck dog, we twelve and a half 
 That house cost millions, twelve and a half 
 But I still got them condoms, twelve in the stash 
 You can't even get mad 
 Say what the hell just laugh 
 Standin' there beautiful like what I'm gon do with you 
 You wanted me to go to school and just play ball 
 What I do, go to school with that ?-ball 
 Here come the ?, here come the? 
 Yeah I dealt that, I'm a hustla though 
 I can't help that 
 You was there when I flipped my first verse 
 Now we gon see my son take his first words 
 And um, absurd, I ain't wanna be no singer ma 
 I just wanted eight carrots on your finger ma 
 Since were young, you thug me I thugged you 
 You hug me, I hugged you 
 You love me, I love you 
 (Tiffany) 
 Ah, baby

 I wanna be what he wants 
 When he wants it 
 Whenever he needs it 
 When he's lonesome and feelin' love-starved 
 I'll be there to feed him 
 Lovin' him a lil' bit more each day 
 Turn the light when I hear him say
