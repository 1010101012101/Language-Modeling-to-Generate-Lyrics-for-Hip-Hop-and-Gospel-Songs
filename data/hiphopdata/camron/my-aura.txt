(Verse 1: cam'ron) 
 We hit to many left turns to make it right, 
 My black fist with peace sign tht save the night, 
 But I'm a stay to fight, laser light. with yah ailike, 
 Heres an orderblack, be a quarterback, take a hike, 
 Hut one hut two hut three yah families tossed, 
 Powdercoke, 81 to yah chest randy moss, 
 How much the candy cost then I explain to folks, 
 It's terrific but be specific when playin' with coke, 
 I refrain from my host, lame this game is a joke, 
 To hit the hot line, got mine the range to the boat, 
 I move the work from new york, to new England, 
 New hampshire, new london, new jersey, new zealand, 
 Hopped out like who dealin' who slingin, 
 Brick makin' like who wheelin who blingin, 
 Then I handle weed, and tell them how my parents be, 
 They got the work go work get money back guaranteed, 
 But I guarantee money with yah money ull be after me, 
 Fuck it up huh, undisastorbly, casualties, acctually, 
 But I move casual, the vunerable, not a judge but call me yah honorable 
 Go head and vomit fool, bomb the unbombible, 
 Do beef like a farmer do, my jewerly is a carnival, 
 Cause the god damn chain is like a ferriswheel, 
 You fuckin' with sosa you won't find a better deal 
 (Chorus: penz) 
 Fuck yah swag my aura shine it shine bright, 
 It's aura time thts all the time the limelight, 
 This is that I don't give a fuck music, 
 Duck when I buck ull get touched if stuck stupid, 
 Fuck yah swag my aura shine it shine bright, 
 It's aura time thts all the time the limelight, 
 Check my aura my aura my aura aura y'all, 
 Check my aura my aura aura my aura y'all, 
 (Verse 2: cam'ron) 
 Ey yo drop coups, not roffs, ock shoot, pop troops, 
 Gloves and my black snub on, it's killa muthafucka, 
 That mac pop flash on snapshot like a kodak get on the block and sell the muthafucka, 
 Ey yo yah girl remain one strip, I be on the main strip, 
 The same strip where the weed, crack, and cocaine flip, 
 Lane prick, change shit, leave 'em with the same split, 
 Wanted air max on my main bitch, huh[? ] 
 I got the massive shotty, but I do math with papi, 
 Yah girl a no no call her joe her ass is sloppy, 
 Costilano, feel the wrath of gotti, 
 These clear diamonds, glass from [? ] 
 Gettin' cash a hobbie, wifey with me, bread for bobby, 
 All thses bugers on my ass yah I'm rather snotty, 
 Yah girl I ordered her let her come explore the cut, 
 And asked her one thing, what[? ], can I tour yah guts, 
 Check my aura my aura aura my aura baby, 
 She said my aura my aura order and always crazy, 
 Had the cards out I ain't even shuffle on em, 
 She felt the gucci boats fur inside buckle on em, 
 Don't pull the duffle on em, see these mills are like a honey moon, 
 Killa keep a couple on 'em bundled on em, 
 Somebody snitchin I'm twitchin throw a muzzle on em, 
 Fire ball through his window some trouble for em, 
 (Chorus: penz) 
 Fuck yah swag my aura shine it shine bright, 
 It's aura time thts all the time the limelight, 
 This is that I don't give a fuck music, 
 Duck when I buck ull get touched if stuck stupid, 
 Fuck yah swag my aura shine it shine bright, 
 It's aura time thts all the time the limelight, 
 Check my aura my aura my aura aura y'all,
