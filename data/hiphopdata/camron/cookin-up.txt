Red slippers, red robe, red kitchen, red stove 
 Red pots, one in the head cocked, one the on the feds probe 
 Red stools, red inf, red floor, your all fakers 
 Red couch, red crystal, red pepper and salt shakers 
 The red room, red curtains, it's summer squish 
 Show some respect, what you expect that's a hundred inch 
 Telescopes, binoculars, the feds hate my bynacula 
 From sellin' coke I'm proper docked that means I'm spectacular 
 They bitin' like Tyson, worse than that dracular 
 Ya moms buy heroin wit no hands I'm smackin' her 
 Let me make ya plane, since dane to danes I made it rain 
 Now in the strip club the Benjies turn to paper planes 
 I'm lilla, you Andre Miller, got a basic game 
 I told ya bitch to hurry up, we don't wait for trains 
 I'm Derek Jeter, 'cause I'm in between the base my mane 
 And that's on Lennox, 7 for 8th ace of kings 
 Silencers on calibers would do it louder bro 
 Sledge hammer, smash his melon I'm the black galicka 
 You know I dump mine on fake niggas one time 
 Wack bitches, rat snitches, my life's a punch line 
 I spend a grip in bars, diamonds studded, vicious cars 
 Tha hoes, ask Joe, we audition ours 
 I hope you make the cut, pop ya puss, move ya butt 
 Ruger up, think we from Houston we done screwed her up 
 We pitchin', we pitchin', friction from mission to mission 
 Block to block, ave. to ave., from kitchen to kitchen 
 We just cookin' up baby, we just cookin' up 
 We just cookin' up homie, we just cookin' up 
 We pitchin', we pitchin', friction from mission to mission 
 Block to block, ave. to ave., from kitchen to kitchen 
 We just cookin' up baby, we just cookin' up 
 We just cookin' up homie, we just cookin' up 
 You don' sold a bottle, huh, I'm twistin' ya cap 
 And I'm luxury girl, come sit on my lap 
 Her friends like, don't go that shit is a trap 
 They'll have you trafficn' swallowin', shittin' smack 
 They pigeons in fact, how you gonna listen to that? 
 You the fliest one in your crew, them bitches is wack 
 Started to smile like you knew this shit was a wrap 
 Her friends was right tho, she gonna be pitchin' some crack 
 I'm a true champ, you glance, 4 door, 2 tramps 
 Fuck my money honey, bring your food stamps 
 Go ahead, you dance, a elephant to you ants 
 Chain, Alaska, Bracelet, Nebraska 
 Crib, well disaster 
 42 plasmas, royal blue Laurie, shorty you bastard 
 Only thing I don't know, what resort we in 
 I tell a bitch, "Get over here", like scorpion 
 Cars, order in flavors, you order from avis 
 Come around me why? They know my ora contagious 
 And I'm sorta courageous, plus the kid smart 
 Forget Bizmark, he gonna catch more than them vapors 
 Next door at your neighbors, they said all of you haters 
 Set you up the very moment, I offered 'em paper 
 In the North I'm the Mayor and my kicks 
 The University of Florida, of course they gators 
 We pitchin', we pitchin', friction from mission to mission 
 Block to block, ave. to ave., from kitchen to kitchen 
 We just cookin' up baby, we just cookin' up 
 We just cookin' up homie, we just cookin' up 
 We pitchin', we pitchin', friction from mission to mission 
 Block to block, ave. to ave., from kitchen to kitchen 
 We just cookin' up baby, we just cookin' up 
 We just cookin' up homie, we just cookin' up
