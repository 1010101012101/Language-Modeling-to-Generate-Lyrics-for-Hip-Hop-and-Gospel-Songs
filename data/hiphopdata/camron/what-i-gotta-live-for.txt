I ain't got shit to live for anyway 
 Yes you do 
 I see these niggas are hell bent on me fuckers 
 You got a lot to live for 
 Shit fuck all that 
 I'm fam you live for me then 
 Fuck that shit 
 Bloodshed Bloodshed Bloodshed 
 Yo yo I'm ready to stick the gun to my head and bust a clip 
 I want to world to see the blood that drip puss to drip 
 Crash the car crush the whip 
 There was one time I love the six fuck this shit 
 Trust a chick never that 
 It's always fuck a bitch then fucked up bitch 
 Girl ran a circus on me Wringling Brothers tip 
 Fuck like a neck fuck I expect 
 I could get weight I'll take half of his cake 
 Run I would debate father had the nerve to tell me I'm a mistake 
 I said dad I told my daughter that I can relate 
 And the beef up the hill is real gettin' live 
 Still sittin' by still gettin' high 
 Now I don't hold my tongue I was wrong enough to tell her 
 That I can stop doin' drugs long enough to sell em 
 Approclamation what detoxication 
 (Ay yo Cam's in the house) A three rock occasion 
 Whoa I'm so high you're so high 
 What the fuck these motherfuckers put in my lye 
 Make a million dollars yo I could if I tried 
 Why the fuck I got to pay him him and him 
 Yo fuck around I'm a spray him him and him 
 Bet it fucked up when your girl lay him him and him 
 Look man that's why I'm a give it up the Benz truck driv it up 
 Every weekend did it up and tell why live for what 
 What do I have to live for? 
 What do I have to live for? 
 What do I have to live for? 
 What do I have to live for? 
 Yo yo I was wishin for knowledge but then have to wishin for college 
 So that mission obolished straight street life power 
 Politics and policy makin' give a fuck how he's debatin 
 Give me this give me that give me your hat give me your gat 
 Give me your shit give me your bricks give me your kicks 
 Matter fact you're pussy give me your bitch 
 Cam is clappin oh man can't go shit with Samuel Jackson 
 It's a time to kill what do I do my girl pregnant 
 Rent is due the phone is off the heat is off 
 No the heat is on nigga the street is on I'm about to beat upon 
 A nigga till they deceased or gone at least I'm gone 
 What do it matter they just realte the business 
 Girl fucked my man like Jada from Menace 
 But I play to the finish got blazed and oblimished 
 Least I wasn't caged in a clinic and now you age in a minute 
 But you know the sharks diplomat ho we know the art 
 Come through leave your shit wet like Noah's Ark 
 We ordered the pie you sort of a lie 
 You ain't 7:30 nigga you about a quarter to five 
 Lights on the line whites goin' blind tell me man God what type of a sign 
 Take a nitrogen nine man that's why I'm a give it up 
 Wrists stay glidded up every weekend did it up tell me why live for what 
 Bloodshed there Grandma dead
