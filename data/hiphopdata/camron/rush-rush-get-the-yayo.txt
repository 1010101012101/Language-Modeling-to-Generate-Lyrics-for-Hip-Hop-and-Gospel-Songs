Rush Rush get the yayo 
 Buzz buzz skin the yayo 
 Rush rush got the yayo 
 Go go sell the yayo 
 Her 90 carrots killa 
 Yes I flip that white pudding 
 But I swear I wish I met dwight gooden 
 To show him that my pitch is better 
 Bring strawberry dogg I'll be rich forever 
 Shit, them two niggas coppin bricks or better 
 Hit the cellular how you want it whipped or regular 
 And tell ya white girls about my white girl, shit I'm part of the reason it's a white world 
 Don't sniff too hard though, u might hurl 
 What you deal with is usually average 
 I'm the husband the movie traffic 
 You frankie flowers lose the faggot

 Got it three points lower than whatever it is 
 Coca leaves are a boat away 
 At the crib got a open face coke buffet 
 Rush Rush get the yayo 
 Buzz buzz skin the yayo 
 Rush rush got the yayo 
 Go go sell the yayo 
 When you sniff it, it start at ya brain 
 Shiimmy down ya heart and ya frame 
 Get scared start to complain 
 Where you get it from I charter the plane 
 Alot of y'all is lackin in knowledge 
 I'm solid liquid back to a solid 
 Manhattan or hollis, after is polished 
 Hit the strip dogg kept crack in the wallet 
 Different towns I push the rock heffer 
 Roca way new rock or rodchester 
 And the shotty is cocked uh 
 Rock ya body rock rock ya body rock 
 Hot shots get hot shots and prolly drop 
 Pop suckas pop make ya lobby hot

 Rush Rush get the yayo 
 Buzz buzz skin the yayo 
 Rush rush got the yayo
