Baby, come and play and lay 
 And stay with me, girlfriend, I'll change your life 
 Spend the night with me, we'll talk and chill 
 And watch TV, she said, "Sure you're right" 
 Some girls says I'm the cutest, others says that I'm the rudest 
 Meditate like a Buddhist, expose 'em like a nudist 
 I'm Jesus, they Judas, my diamonds, the bluest 
 Got the answers, they clueless, Ashanti, Foolish

 Called her a stupid bitch, sorry, nah, I might have meant it

 Yo, Miami listenin' to Brisco, I get it cookin' like Crisco 
 From Chi-Town back to Frisco, my diamonds like a disco

 A hood bitch, stretch marks, BBB, cellulite 
 Baby, we need each other, don't wanna meet your mother 
 My mouth is like the sewer, yeah, yeah, I keep it gutter 
 I sell hot peas and butter, don't wanna see you suffer 
 Nigga like me wouldn't meet another 
 You clogged up, I be your plumber 
 Shorty, like Dr?no, you know how the game go 
 Different colored cars, our garage a rainbow 
 I'm the leprechaun, but I sell methadone 
 Marijuan, heroine, ten year run marathon 
 My hood like Lebanon, but that is Benetton 
 You up in sumin' fly, I got my weapon on 
 We get our chefin' on, chefin' on everyday 
 I got the cookie cutter, mami, the pepper spray 
 Baby, come and play and lay 
 And stay with me, girlfriend, I'll change your life

 You had your guard up at first like a soccer goalie 
 If I got it, you get it, baby, I get it, you got it

 'Cause you lookin' exotic, now you gettin' erotic 
 Like you straight from the tropics, wanna shoot it and cock it 
 Not the blama, baby girl, I'm talkin' sumin' else 
 All she do is look and say, "Cam, you sumin' else" 
 Listen love, I ain't the one that get lovey dovey 
 But you lookin' good, you ever need a hubby lovely 
 You got to love me, shots of bubbly 
 Get your mouth wet, you the outlet, got to plug me 
 Baby, come and play and lay
