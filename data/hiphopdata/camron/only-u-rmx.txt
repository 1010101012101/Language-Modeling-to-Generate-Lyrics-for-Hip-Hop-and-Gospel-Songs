Oh I can't wait to get next to you 
 Oh I just can't leave you alone 
 Boy you got me doing things that I would never do 
 And I can't stop the way I'm feelin' if I wanted to 
 I'm crazy 'bout the way you that you could make me say your name 
 And if I couldn't have you I would probably go insane cause... 
 Only you can make me feel (only you can me make me feel) 
 And only you can take me there (only you can take me there) 
 And only you can make me feel (only you only you can make me feel) 
 And only you can take me there (only you can take me there) 
 Oh I can't wait to get next to you 
 Oh I just can't leave you alone 
 Boy you stay inside my mind ain't no denyin' that 
 And only you could do them things that got me comin' back 
 Gotta be the realest thing that I have ever felt 
 And I'll do what I gotta do to keep you to myself 'cause... 
 Crazy 
 'Bout the way you (make me) feel 
 I just gotta have you 
 Here and I 
 Want to let you 
 Know 
 I won't ever let you 
 Go 
 Oh I can't wait to get next to you 
 Oh I just can't leave you alone...
