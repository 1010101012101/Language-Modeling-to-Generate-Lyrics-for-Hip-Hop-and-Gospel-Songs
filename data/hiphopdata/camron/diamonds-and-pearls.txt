Diamonds weighed a ton of it 
 And I didn't pay for none of it 
 Fuck all the jewelers 
 And whatever become of it 
 For gazy crazy 
 Never bought from donny 
 Just stole from jacob and distorted ivy 
 Gabriella's cousin got the fake stones 
 The kind you take home 
 Come back with straight chrome 
 Our macks to break bones 
 You're going be stretched 
 Macho from ts 
 Said fuck the bs 
 In miami almost hit 'em up for 3 lefs 
 Had to stop them they was undercover detecs 
 But I be fresh 
 Beguts 
 We fess 
 Air ones lead step 
 All they say is he reps 
 (Voice) 
 Diamonds and pearls 
 Boys and girls 
 I'll give you the world 
 My love can do just all for you 
 My love 
 Yo I flip that purple punch 
 Lunch purple pain 
 I'm the prince 
 The sole prince 
 Of purple rein 
 But I'm blasted up 
 V 1 acid cut 
 Pink diamond 
 Diamond backs 
 I ain't fat 
 Bastard what 
 Pal pass it up 
 Pay with plastic bucks 
 Still drink plico out plastic cups 
 Pardon the aston martin fast as fuck 
 The partin startin to smash the traffic up 
 And my furs apply 
 That's hers and i 
 Yeah I and hers 
 Yeah sir curves and thighs 
 It's the birds and guys 
 That flip birds and pies 
 Any sizzurp wizzurp 
 Word I'm fly 
 Remember best out 
 They were the best out 
 A crew from harlem 
 Wasn't down felt left out 
 Yeah coupes I wanted 
 Want crews they flaunted 
 Taunted 
 Girls jewels tools 
 I knew what I wanted 
 Watched the homie shine 
 Then was a lonely time 
 Boat ride bus ride 
 Can't go I'm only nine 
 Ten years later 
 I'm the one sony signed 
 Ten mil later 
 Damn you watched your homie grind 
 'Cause I'm past chrome 
 Got that passion 
 Paprika hot tamale salt and pepper sads on 
 For real I'm something else 
 Still an underbelt 
 Let's go to the district steal something else
