29-5 live, the courts are pigeon 
 Blame the economy, the courts are living 
 Of course I'm living, bought some linen 
 Take a courts on winning, forts of women 
 Monday through Friday the Porsche is driven 
 Change the Range to Thursdays, put that away 
 Hard top Wednesdays, drop top Saturdays 
 Sunday's Piscataway, 8 ki's I have we lay 
 Half today, my whole island like Gilligan, it's fast away 
 By the way, what's up, dawg? Who's hardest? 
 Probation over, yeah, I'ma catch some new charges 
 Crime the fricassee recipe, mess with me 
 40th my pedigree, Big L regale 
 R.I.P. to hand me legs, some name stamp he said 
 Saying my dear you, tomorrow your families dead 
 You a fag, fairy, no homo, that's scary 
 Don't mean a e-mail or phone when I say Blackberry 
 It's a homicide, homi, homi, homicide 
 It's a homicide, homi, homi, homicide 
 It's a homicide, someone unlucky died 
 Yellow tape damn, right outside Kentucky Fried 
 Figure I stay and lock it, fuck it 380 cock it 
 King Jaffi Joe, I feel like spacely rockets 
 Come and weight these pockets, the profits display these profits 
 Play no way to stop it and my engine 80 rockets 
 No Yao Ming, no T-Mac 
 Lambo, skeet rat, 300 G stacks 
 Wanna place a bet? Please match or breeze back 
 Offensive coordinator hater, I read traps 
 These niggas need naps, they bitches got weave naps 
 Believe that, fuck with my a seeds and you'll get seized, snatched 
 Over these pack we cap knee caps, teeth caps 
 Believe that, fill your tweets, beat your raps 
 It's a homicide, homi, homi, homicide 
 It's a homicide, homi, homi, homicide 
 It's a homicide, someone unlucky died 
 Yellow tape damn, right outside Kentucky Fried 
 It's a homicide, homi, homi, homicide 
 It's a homicide, homi, homi, homicide 
 It's a homicide, someone unlucky died 
 Yellow tape damn, right outside Kentucky Fried 
 Damn Cam, you did it to consumers 
 White and red boomers, blue and red Laguna's 
 Dead all the rumors, all these rappers are my juniors 
 Ma, you can't swim, well come follow the tuna 
 Full moon, we got girls to moon us 
 No cuddling ma, you won't spoon us 
 Don't spit game, just sell Rick James 
 Baby boy, my nick name is Switch Lanes 
 Slash stick change, Slash get brain 
 Slash that nigga, Slash make it rain 
 Slash tell summer girl, get the summer Z's 
 Know what's in the dungaree's a hundred G's 
 It's a homicide, homi, homi, homicide 
 It's a homicide, homi, homi, homicide 
 It's a homicide, someone unlucky died 
 Yellow tape damn, right outside Kentucky Fried 
 It's a homicide, homi, homi, homicide 
 It's a homicide, homi, homi, homicide 
 It's a homicide, someone unlucky died 
 Yellow tape damn, right outside Kentucky Fried
