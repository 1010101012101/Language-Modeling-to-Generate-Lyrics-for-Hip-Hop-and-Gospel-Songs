(Feat. Hell Rell) 
 They say beauty's in the eye of the beholder 
 That why I look in the mirror every morning, and realize how fly I am 
 They wanna know what fuckin' label I'm signing to 
 I'm the C.E.O. of Diplomat records I sign myslef get your cake up 
 Cam'ron: 
 I'm like a crack addict, with these mac's I got a bad habbit 
 Clack clack, in the pen, back out, I'm back at it 
 It's like my lawyer know black magic, black rabbit 
 Out the black hat black, back home to my craft matic 
 Next to it statch mattress, under it, cash bastard 
 Had them bitches ass backwards, fuck 'em like a jack rabbit 
 Itchy crab status, call the girl a itchy twat, stick me not, I go and get dutches it's a 50 box 
 I weed hash, when I breeze pass, breathe fast, eat ass, or point like Steve Nash 
 But I'm fixin to be, OG Nixon in 3 
 Enough jew'ls you fool I'm cool, my kicks are a G 
 I got tramp whores, yours, been V.I.P. since B.I.G. I never seen a dance floor (Nope) 
 Behind the velvet rop, pop bottles, hell-a smoke 
 Girls wit contacts want contact, I tell 'em nope 
 You go pon' da river, leave you at panja rivers 
 Don Juan, a Long John, the long arm will harm or hit ya 
 We like the March Of Dimes, the way we march wit dimes, good help is hard to find, salt wipe the art I twine 
 Art design, arch a mine, Fresno to Clarke I'm fine 
 Sun ill, Gunhill, back to Central park is mine (Mine) 
 Till this day dude still followed by State troops, Gray Coupe, written my momma name made a mistake, oops 
 (Get 'em Daddy) Daddy Got 'em, y'all glad he shot 'em, hommy holiday, I love it when mommy say 
 (Get 'em Daddy) Had to bite, put it on satellite, get ya money up jewelry tight swagger right 
 (Get 'em Daddy) Got 'em mommy, you my Gotham Bonnie 
 'Cause I'm Batman with the pump, Johnny Johnny 
 (Get 'em Daddy) Honey smile, don't act funny style 
 In one ear, yeah yeah, 220 thou' 
 Hell Rell: 
 Po-Po wanna pick his brain, Ho's wanna give him brain 
 We rose up to bigger fame, Glows from the tence chain 
 Make foes wanna get a slam, These holo's will twist man 
 I left outta Clinton Max, got picked up by Killa Cam 
 Fam we on another level, I'm bout to pull that porche out and flood the other bezel, I get dubs like shovels 
 Y'all niggas fuck wit pebbels, I flip big bogers, swtich Rover's, hit 'em wit the gun that's in his hoster 
 You could goggle cum ma, why sip soda?, These niggas wanna be Scarface, I'm wit Sosa 
 You need to have my number, you wanna buy weight, Fuck a borough, we floodin the whole Tri-State 
 20 thou' on the arm, more rocks on the charm, and I done cop from every damn haze spot on Autobomb 
 Heavy weed smoker, get ounces for free, out of everything you got, it ain't amountin to me 
 I'm in the crowd, Victoria, mac in the back, See these little niggas rappin' to rap, man I just happen to rap 
 Know what I do, manufacturin crack, Keep talkin', get you snatch for that scratch, clapped wit the mac 
 I'm bout to buy more guns, bout to buy more trucks, and when we on the road, bitches follow the tour bus 
 You mad cause you losin, plus in the Bronx, I'm responsible for most of the stabbings and the shootings 
 (Get 'em Daddy) Daddy Got 'em, y'all glad he shot 'em, hommy holiday, I love it when mommy say 
 (Get 'em Daddy) Had to bite, put it on satellite, get ya money up jewelry tight swagger right 
 (Get 'em Daddy) Got 'em mommy, you my Gotham Bonnie 
 'Cause I'm Batman with the pump, Johnny Johnny 
 (Get 'em Daddy) Honey smile, don't act funny style 
 In one ear, yeah yeah, 220 thou' 
 (Get 'em daddy)
