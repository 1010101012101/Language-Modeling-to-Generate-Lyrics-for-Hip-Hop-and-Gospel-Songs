 Dude 
 (Antoine) 
 I feel you dude check this out 
 I only imagine you in every way 
 I only think of you all night and all day 
 I only want you when I'm awake and when I'm asleep 
 You don't need a thing 
 Cause you mean everything to me 
 I'm your shelter in the rain 
 I'll take away the pain 
 Never have to hurt again 
 Wanna be your love supreme 
 Without you I'm not complete 
 You're my everything 
 I breathe you girl 
 I eat you girl 
 I need you girl 
 I speak you girl 
 I dream you girl 
 You be my world 
 You're my everything 
 I'd never die for you 
 I'd rather live to love you 
 You could take my arms 
 I'd still find ways to touch you 
 You could take my legs 
 I'd still run to your rescue 
 I love you I really do 
 And I

 When you need someone to call (Call Me) 
 You know I'm not far away (I'm right there) 
 So whenever wherever whatever you need 
 Girl all can say 
 You are my everything (I need you)
