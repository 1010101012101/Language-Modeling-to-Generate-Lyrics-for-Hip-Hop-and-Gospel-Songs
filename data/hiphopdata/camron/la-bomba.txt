(Cam'ron) 
 My paper yes my paper 
 Got me sitting on five acres, Hi Hater 
 Fly gators coke cooker pie baker drunk driver girl getter dice shaker 
 Try play us your whole crew will be price payers 
 Knife waver gat tooter life taker 
 Nice flavor real fruity like Cly Davis 
 Sweat suit fly asics, Coke test I aced it

 Gun right by the cash (What's That) the money clip 
 This Gucci kick done got your girl in nuddy pictures sue me nigga told me she want me to make her booty bigger 
 I'm the reason true but the reason she breezing through 
 She ain't smart she wanna part and kill the season too 
 Get her an audition and I'm in a motition

 (Chorus: Cam'ron) 
 Come to our parties 
 They drinking that more Bacardi

 I ain't sell enough records to have the things I got 
 First bring a drop bring a store bring a yacht bring a crib bring a horse chain whole wings are hot 
 Let me stop thses niggas like to sing a lot 
 Shot in his hand like his girl finger pop 
 Ain't no trouble asking 
 I'm in the bubble flashing 
 Walther P.P.K 380 double action 
 Played the restaurant 
 In the east Saint Lawerance 
 Patented leather, black and decker 
 Did your girl played your ark 
 Like the 45 I pop and dump her 
 Hung up she called me back tried to block her number 
 She could not get dumber 
 In the winter blocks in summer 
 Your son my little man, Your pops my runner 
 He washed the whip, said y'all alliance is gone 
 The he pulled out a wrench and turned the hydrant on 
 (Chorus: Cam'ron) 
 Come to our parties 
 They drinking that more Bacardi 
 The music is hard body 
 They puffing that Bob Marley 
 That jonga 
 The arsenal momma even ready for drama like La la la bomba 
 I can lomba (la la la bomba) 
 Niggas pull out they lamas like (la la la bomba) like (la la la bomba) like (la la la bomba) like (la la la bomba) (la la la bomba)

 You don't even hear the room when I breeze by 
 I see why SLR me and gy 
 Can't stop hit the horn at least three times 
 They like who that 
 Nigga we that

 Here take this raw too finish then you read that 
 Banana clips sweep 
 Six feet where you sleep at 
 Nigga believe that 
 That short change leave that 
 You don't need a g-pack 
 The whole thing we keep that 
 So what's goodie 
 Black suede and hoodies 
 No chain I seen more bang bangs than boogie 
 (HA) Yeah I straight aim it fully 
 And text your hunter talk cause my main man's a bully 
 Yeah this kid is the truth 
 I said killa fuck the cars just give me the booth 
 (Chorus: Cam'ron) 
 Come to our parties 
 They drinking that more Bacardi 
 The music is hard body 
 They puffing that Bob Marley 
 That jonga 
 The arsenal momma even ready for drama like La la la bomba 
 I can lomba (la la la bomba) 
 Niggas pull out they lamas like (la la la bomba) like (la la la bomba) like (la la la bomba) like (la la la bomba) (la la la bomba)
