JD: Let's rock and roll baby 
 Cam'Ron: Killa Cam So So Def 
 JD: Y'all know y'all know y'all know y'all know 
 Cam: Untertainment I'm here now I'm here now 
 Cam: 
 Yo you wonder who I are I guzzle up at the bar 
 See me in the car let's start with the double R 
 Range Rover Rolls Royce even got a rocky Roly 
 See mo' ice than a hockey goalie 
 Maybe eatin' guacamole 
 I do it out 
 Now I live it out 
 Cars gotta whip 'em out 
 Every year I get it out 
 (Why?) I'll be long gone 
 (Where?) Probably Hong Kong 
 Girls wit they thong on 
 I'm playin' Don Juan 
 Drinkin' Sean John, 
 Where the trau mon? 
 You smoke weed, whatcha think girl? 
 Uh-huh 
 Start the car up, take her on a long ride 
 She think my steerin' wheel on the wrong side 
 No, I'm sorry 
 This is the Ferrari 
 Le Mon like Bacardi 
 Rock like safari 
 But, la di da di, we likes to party 
 And every night believe we gonna leave wit somebody 
 We were rockin' and rollin' 
 Now we roll it and smoke it 
 On the phone and were jokin' 
 While ya strollin' and hopin' 
 For the tone that we spoke in 
 And I know that ya open 
 Pour some Branson, Lye 
 Ha, a brand new five 
 Hot man, God damn, Killa Cam we live 
 Cam: 
 Now come on girlfriend, I ain't no actin' willie 
 So when you around me don't be actin' silly 
 Accididdy, come on I got the baddest bitties 
 Ass is pretty, like hos down in Magic City 
 Now you smoke hos, with the coco 
 Niggaz, say I'm loco 
 'Cause I'm low-low from the po-pos 
 Every night I stroke hos 
 No-no to homos, 
 F doin' promos 
 I was def already, I just added the so-so 
 Wherever we at, ready to act, betta be strapped 
 Live the life around me whoever tell me to pat 
 And when it comes to the cash bet I'm heavy wit that 
 And if your man wanna bet, I bet he be set 
 And your little girlfriend, she was wet off the bat 
 From the Chevy Senette and yo I bet she be back 
 For the one night stand, yeah the sex in the sack 
 I ask her if she miss it then tell her to kiss it 
 Cam: 
 Yo your girl around me is like sand to a beach, or a gram to a ki, or 
 Branch to a tree 
 Your money, is like my advance to a g 
 And you'll see me and Lance in a V 
 Actin' wild, Jimmy back me child 
 How long you think an ounce gonna last me now? 
 But I love when hos calls me the cat's meow (meow) 
 'Cause I run up in 'em and I make they cat meow (meow) 
 Are you hip to dive, how we dip to the drive? 
 1/2 of my game, yo that shit be a lie 
 But it's true about Duke, from the hoop to the five 
 And I'm right behind ya in a coupe that we drive 
 Baby am I slick, all your friends is sick 
 To see me and my chicks in DKNY kicks 
 And my click, we get the dank and bounce 
 And put anotha half a mil in my bank account 
 JD: 
 Untertainment, So So Def, collabo, you know, yeah
