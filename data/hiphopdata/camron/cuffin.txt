 Cam'ron: 
 Yo, I get Velveta chain Antartica

 Just wanna borrow her 
 So partner, I heard that your starving her 
 My cheese American, but the cars are foreigner 
 But women they be cuffin 
 They be not for nothing 
 Boo I'm not your husband 
 End of discussion 
 Diamonds well they rushin' 
 Mami why you Rushin' 
 No I'm not your muffin, don't call me pumpkin 
 We was only humpin' 
 You are a jumpoff 
 Me? I get it jumpin' 
 Babygirl fallback 
 Thought that I was all that 
 But she had a big ass, that's what you call crack 
 You should get your jaw cracked 
 See if they restore that 
 Fighting over bitches 
 Look here your broad wack 
 You should learn to lore black 
 When it comes to whores Jack 
 You do not own one 
 Girls get jawed tapped, Yours tapped (yours tapped)

 Cause niggas always cuffin 
 Knowing I be fucking 
 Homie you a muffin 
 Call you like a pumpkin 
 Who you think you Punkin 
 Always into somethin' 
 Fifty grand is nothing, especially when you hustlin' 
 Few bottle, two models, on me front back 
 Slim jeans, Loui ski boots unstrapped 
 Look at the glow 
 I get your hoe to come off one snap 
 She got me pinned up too the wall like a thumb tack 
 You already know this 
 Money, I control this 
 Seven - Fifty notice 
 Staring like a goldfish 
 Rollie that's a gold wrist 
 Cromie that's a Four - Fifth 
 Pockets know how to hold chips, hold six

 And I'm gellin like a felon

 Like Oj Simpson, I just wanna stab her 
 Like Oj The Juiceman, I'm flier than a sparrow (Ay!) 
 Retarded ass earrings 
 Just call em' Lil' Daryl (Burrr) 
 Shaving but it's crazy 
 I can't let no hoe play me (Nah) 
 Gotta sign a Prenup now if they date me, Well damn 
 It's Gucci, rawer that raw sushi 
 Gangster like all of my movies 
 If it's good don't act boogie 
 Your boyfriend home, but his girlfriend out sick 
 My dick in her mouth, sound like she got an accent
