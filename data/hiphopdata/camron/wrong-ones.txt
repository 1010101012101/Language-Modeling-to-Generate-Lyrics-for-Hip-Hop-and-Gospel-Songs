 Ay Yo you got ta undastand 
 I'm like a food to tha world 
 'Cause I'm friends wit ya man 
 Plus your cool wit my girl 
 Now I don't really understand how dat cat he be stressin u 
 I don't understand that you grown but yet he question u 
 Guessin that you love him but you in it for tha pay 
 But he know where you at every minute of tha day 
 But since we learned to creep 
 Is like we yearn for sleep 
 And my girls in my face when I don't return tha beep 
 It's like a sin or a crime 
 U in tha benz all tha time 
 But ya man know you ain't wit ya friends all tha time 
 I'll be selfish 
 Sayin' chancin tha long 
 Dats why I hang up when he answer tha phone 
 And I'll be callin from tha house in tha paul lobby 
 Plus I know him he too cheap for caller ID 
 And my girl in my face jus stressin me child 
 But Ill dial anotha number if she press redial 
 Ay yo me and you creep right now it's all fun 
 But you ever really think about tha long run 
 When tha nights over and it's all done 
 Were tha wrong ones were tha wrong ones 
 Ay yo me and you creep right now it's all fun 
 But you ever really think about tha long run 
 When tha nights over and it's all done 
 Were tha wrong ones were tha wrong ones 
 (Cam) 
 I feel bad but good uh huh 
 When I'm sexin u 
 But undastand its more than jus tha sex with u 
 Its ya otha side you show me your intellectual 
 The way you handle tha things 
 Minds a professional 
 But a real freak behind close doors 
 And you have me open tha way you throw yours 
 What tha hell you think why I bout those drawz 
 And when you go down how you move those jawz 
 Oh Lord 
 For you I'll be out on a search 
 Damn you look good in ya blouse and ya skirts 
 But we got to be careful when we out doin' dirt 
 This ain't about us its about who we hurt 
 But ?mom? I love ya technique 
 Tha way you make tha bed squeak 
 Ya man can't get it up 
 Maybe girl he deat meat 
 So lets creep 
 In a lex jeep 
 At a secret location do it again next week 
 (Cam) 
 Now that I sit here I lay distraught 
 Tha feelings get involved when you play tha sport 
 'Cause when I'm wit my girl you even stay in thought 
 And that dates back to my days in court 
 Sayin' you admired tha way I fought 
 U ain't even listen when my airplay was short 
 Me for you girl yo I feel we deserve it 
 But you ever really think about is it worth it 
 When tha nights over and tha cris' is gone 
 You got kids and a man playin' mr. mom 
 Your man and my wife will be gone in tha smoke 
 'Cause tha last time we did it tha condom broke 
 (Phone convo)

 (Girl:) Oh you can Lay down and make a baby 
 But you can't take care of one

 (Chorus till fade)
