Uh huh, yeah 
 This goes to all my hustlers, entertainers 
 Of course, athletes in the struggle [Incomprehensible] 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo 
 Some get a little and some get none 
 Shit, I was part of the some get none 
 The ball, run for run, play the slums for crumbs 
 Wired, real tired, till my lungs are done 
 After all, I was nice in ball, 
 But I came to practice weed scented 
 Report card like the speed limit, 55-55 expellable 
 If your nice they make sure that you eligible 
 Pretty final, '92 played the city finals 
 Pretty swift, real MVP, and 55th, I can hoop, yo 
 All-American in my age group, yo 
 Raised bad settled for a Ju. Co. 
 Uh, but why they let a thug on campus 
 All I did was rob and mug on campus 
 Sliced, rolled dice, got shiest on campus 
 At the toast got bad, paid the price on campus 
 Forgot about ball, I was done dude 
 Now I'm in county in an orange jumpsuit, middle of Texas 
 Call moms, she don't want the phone act 
 She don't condone it, Cam don't come home, shit 
 'Cause the streets is a short stop 
 Either you slangin' crack-rock or you got a wicked jump shot 
 'Cause the streets is a short stop 
 Either you slangin' crack-rock or you got a wicked jump shot 
 'Cause the streets is a short stop 
 Either you slangin' crack-rock or you got a wicked jump shot 
 'Cause the streets is a short stop 
 Either you slangin' crack-rock or you got a wicked jump shot 
 Yo, yo, ayo, comin' back home, I thought it'd be cool 
 But everybody like, "Cam, yo I thought you're in school" 
 Nah, I'm about to go back, huh, they know that I'm lyin' 
 See me on Broadway, know when I'm buyin' 
 Niggas gettin' money, know what I'm eye'n 
 Shiesty again, no where without iron 
 Seems like my school life self destroyed 
 Fuck gettin' a job, B.I.G. self employed 
 Slugs pop, drug spot, runnin' the thing 
 Played ball on the weekend, 300 a game 
 Till one of the workers pulled a small case 
 Mouth runnin' like a dog race, tryin' to get us all laced 
 I was slangin, but wasn't a kingpin, a slow case n', verdict probation 
 Tried to fuck my P.O., she ignored that 
 Said, "Know what Cam your found with more crack" 
 See what happen', stopped the crackin', start rappin', quit the clappin' 
 'Cause the streets is a short stop 
 Either you slangin' crack-rock or you got a wicked jump shot 
 'Cause the streets is a short stop 
 Either you slangin' crack-rock or you got a wicked jump shot 
 'Cause the streets is a short stop 
 Either you slangin' crack-rock or you got a wicked jump shot 
 'Cause the streets is a short stop 
 Either you slangin' crack-rock or you got a wicked jump shot 
 Yo, yo, as a young nigga, always into crime 
 But no matter what, yo, always used to rhyme 
 So in that I became more curious 
 Fuck bein' up north delirious, more serious 
 Uh, so Killa did mixtapes 
 CEO's heard, now here come big cake 
 But one cat said Cam you better recoup 
 Before you back on your block, baby, dead on the stoop 
 But un-hooked me up with all this cheddar and loot 
 The best rap deal of all time next to Snoop 
 Money more to clutch, money more to touch 
 I don't just rhyme I own liquor stores and such, but yeah 
 Yo, the rap game remind me of the crack game 
 Niggas wanna get they gun, then start the clap game 
 For dat fame Throwa Untertainment 
 Sport, drugs, entertainment, till the arraignment, Killa 
 'Cause the streets is a short stop 
 Either you slangin' crack-rock or you got a wicked jump shot 
 'Cause the streets is a short stop 
 Either you slangin' crack-rock or you got a wicked jump shot 
 'Cause the streets is a short stop 
 Either you slangin' crack-rock or you got a wicked jump shot 
 'Cause the streets is a short stop 
 Either you slangin' crack-rock or you got a wicked jump shot 
 That's how it go on my block, mad props, let off mad shots 
 All my peoples out there tryin' it 
 Dis a problem for they environment, killa 
 Sports, drugs, entertainment, till the arraignment 
 Uh huh, yeah
