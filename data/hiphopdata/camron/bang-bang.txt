Shooting till my motherfuckin' hand fall off 
 The track stars the gun shot ran y'all off 
 I pop like a soda watch the can fall off 
 I can kill y'all and y'all boss 
 Shotguns handguns louder than a band drum 
 You fuckin' with the drum major or let me play you the anthem 
 Bang bang bang bang call it heavy metal 
 I say bang bang bitch I make you feel every letter 
 B-a-n-g- b-a-n-g- g-a-n-g 
 We spray then leave 
 We play when we no 
 We play N-E 
 V-e-r- c-p-r 
 Doctor Carter are you the d-z's boy 
 Young money motherfucka' deez these boyz 
 Bitches you crazy 
 Weez retardz 
 Watch nina, mack and Tommy have a brief menaj 
 Like (gunshots) like (gunshots) yeah 
 Soulja boy on the beat 
 But you can call me Chef Boyardee 
 'Cause I'm a heat this shit 
 And I'm a eat this shit 
 Planet earth is my toilet your beneath this shit 
 Then I flush and whipe my ass 
 Guns slinger like a pass 
 I cock back and throw a bomb now hail mary 
 Your tail fary farytale very frail 
 And yeah we got them hammers try and hit every nail 
 Let 'em sail up the river with that hoe shit 
 Or leave 'em face down in the fuckin' ocean 
 I ain't on no other shit bitch I'm on some more shit 
 That hello how you doing I am at your front door shit 
 That aw naw he got a gun oh shit shit shit
