 He tried to play meeee

 Shinay was in love with her school 
 Rich wasn't liking his school

 He was a hustler 
 She's a customer 
 Now he's off doing a biiiid 
 Tee got shot with a shotgun on his block 
 I wish it was all preteeeend 
 Nana would get hiiigh 
 Hard enough getting buy 
 When is it all gonna ennnnd 
 Me I'm still holding on 
 The team still rollin' strong 
 The ave is down the streeeeet 
 But I'm a street target 
 Call me a meat market

 The blocks still pumpin 
 Isn't it somethiiiin? 
 Needles, knives and nineeees 
 There's no tomorrooooow 
 Food getting borroweeeeed 
 What kind of life is mine??
