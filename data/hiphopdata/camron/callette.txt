Cam'ron: 
 Rude and Cuban, Mexicana mmm, mean switch when she movin' 
 I be up in the Heights right in the mix of the fuedin' 
 I keep my toolo, 'cause I'm no foolo 
 Espano mas o menos but tu quiero culo 
 She said "Ooh you fresco" I said "Boo but I'm fresh though 
 Let's go, sexo, tu bece webo 
 How'd I pursue", said "She not in the mood" 
 I said "Not to be rude, ma I'm a popular dude" 
 "Oh the guy from the tube, who be rockin' them cubes" 
 We can rock in Moraco, there you can rock in the nude 
 Two seven a night, huh, she said (aye dios mio) 
 I got 'em there, I can't, well adios dear 
 Caught a fish in the sea, and I go fishin' god 
 I caught 50 thousand all on my fishin' rod 
 Cam'ron: 
 (Aye dios, aye dios mio) 
 (Aye dios, aye dios mio)

 J.R. Writer: 
 I know Dominicans with boats that get it off the coast 
 And pitch it all in boats from the milli or the post 
 They feelin' me the most 'cause when I'm pickin' up a key 
 The supplyer say "Callette" and gimme one for free 
 But I'm shinin' 'cause I'm grindin' hijo 
 Every diamond frio, the Montecito 
 The bitch'll say (aye dios mio) 
 Not from Reno, he pulled up in the drop with Tito 
 Watch me tiko I run outta roads, pop ya kleeco 
 I chop badeko, that's cooked crack you hood rat 
 Pushin' where you push at, you ain't even a good pack 
 That means your cook's wack, besides that doja I'm fly 
 That's what I tell 'em when I'm strollin' it by 
 I'm like, "Como tu estas? Donde tu va? 
 No need to get ya number, yo no voy a damma 
 Yo ma, I know that you shy, let's go and get high" 
 Next thing you know he strokin' her side and she's yelling out
