You are gone. 
 I'm so all alone. 
 Here's what's left of my happy home. 
 "She'll be back" 
 That's what I said 
 As I stare at the ceiling. 
 'Cause I need you baby. 
 Oh, how I miss you baby. 
 'Cause I need you baby. 
 Oh, how I miss you baby. [baby, baby, baby, baby, baby] {fade out} 
 'Cause I need you baby. 
 Oh, how I miss you baby. 
 'Cause I need you baby. 
 Oh, how I miss you baby. 
 You are gone. 
 I'm so all alone. 
 Here's what's left of my happy home. 
 "She'll be back" 
 That's what I said 
 As I stare at the ceiling. 
 'Cause I need you baby. 
 Oh, how I miss you baby.

 Oh, how I miss you baby. [baby, baby, baby, baby, baby] {fade out}
