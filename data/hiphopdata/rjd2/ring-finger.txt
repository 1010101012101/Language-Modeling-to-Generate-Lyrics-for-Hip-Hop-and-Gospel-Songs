(Vocals - Wendy Kaiser) 
 1, 2... 1 2 3 4 [ooh! ah!] 
 {During the first 25 seconds it sounds like there's an "uhn" with the snare hit} 
 And now, 
 Don't pull me down on you. 
 I be the woman of a consume. 
 Comes from the sought desires, 
 I can be loved. 
 Follow those pleasures, 
 There she goes. 
 Please lover stay. 
 (Ey Ah!) x4 {Ah! is faded out with the snare hits} 
 {The below onomatopoeia-type samples occur during this next lyrics section, but are very low in volume. Same with below} 
 My love for a woman from (...?). (???) (x2) 
 I be the woman of a consume. 
 (x5) 
 Ah! 
 Jump up! 
 Ah! 
 (Pu pmuJ) 
 Ah! 
 Jump up! 
 Oh! {only four time} 
 My love for a woman from (...?). (???) (x2) 
 I be the woman of a consume.
