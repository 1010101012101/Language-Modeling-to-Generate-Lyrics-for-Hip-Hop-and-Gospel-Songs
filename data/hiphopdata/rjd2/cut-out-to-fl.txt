(Girl) 
 Is there something wrong? 
 (Guy) 
 Ah... I was just sorta, you know, thinkin' about tomorrow. The lawyer 
 Said I'll probably get off; you know, probation or something like that. 
 But he might be saying that afraid I'll jump bail and take off. 
 (Girl) 
 What are you gonna do? 
 (Guy) 
 I was thinking about cutting out to Florida tonight. 
 (Guy) 
 I said I'm thinking about getting lost down there. 
 You know, it's real warm down there; 
 If I moved down there I could get a blanket and sleep 
 Out on the beaches at night. 
 (Girl) 
 Where will I find you? What if I want you? 
 (Guy) 
 Yeah but hmm... I'm used to being independent 
 I couldn't be put in a cage or anything 
 And besides, you'll never wait. 
 (Girl) 
 Yes I will. 
 (Guy) 
 You say that now, but you don't really mean that. 
 (Girl) 
 I will. I promise I will. Promise I will...
