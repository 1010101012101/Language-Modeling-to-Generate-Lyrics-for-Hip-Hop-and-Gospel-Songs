Something finna happen bih, I can feel it bih [x2] 
 I'm para para para para noid 
 I'm para para para para noid 
 Deze hoes got me paranoid 
 Deze niggahs got me paranoid 
 Da police & da muthafuckin feds got me paranoid 
 [Verse 1:] 
 Muthafuck da world 
 Cuz da world is evil 
 Just bought me a new 40 
 I call dat bitch da sequel 
 Dat why I don't goto church 
 Cuz I cant trust the preacher 
 I don't fuck hoes at my house 
 Cuz I can't trust dem neither 
 I see a car wit 10 on it 
 I think its dem people 
 Cuz keep yo shit 100 
 Dat shit must be illegal 
 Da feds dun picked up 20 niggahs 
 Now dey got me peepin 
 I heard dem niggahs rob 
 Dat why I keep on reachin 
 And while I'm ridin dolo 
 Cuz muhfuckas sneaky 
 I don't talk around niggahs 
 Dats how shit be leakin 
 I keep behind dem toolies 
 I got my fuckin reasons 
 And why I ain't superfriendly 
 Cuz bitch I ain't no deacon 
 [Chorus] 
 [Verse 2:] 
 A niggah called my phone 
 I feel he tawkin crazy 
 Tawkin bout his plug 
 And how he can whip a baby 
 I hung up on dat niggah 
 Well bitch dis ain't da 80's 
 I bet I hit you long 
 And dat ain't how you play me 
 A bitch dat stop my car 
 Tawkin bout she pregnant 
 Bitch you tryna come up 
 I don't understand dat language 
 Cuz me & you never fucked 
 Ain't never got you naked 
 You sucked my dick & jacked me off 
 And after dat I fainted 
 Bitch you picked the wrong one 
 Cuz I can make you famous 
 I cant trust deze hoes 
 I don't know what dey thinkin 
 Police lurkin hard 
 Got me scared to drive 
 Oprah tried to pull me 
 I'm paranoid at high 
 [Chorus] 
 [Verse 3:] 
 Who da fuck to trust 
 Cuz friends done got shady 
 Cuz one of my lil homies 
 Fuck my other dawg lady 
 I ain't gone tell him shit 
 Cuz he gone think I'm hatin 
 My cousin robbed his big brother on 380 
 Da streets done got slow 
 So everybody taken 
 Most of da niggahs in da county 
 Got everybody shaken 
 Dem niggahs droppin names 
 Dependin what dey facin 
 Its 4o'clock in da morning 
 I'm in da crib pacin 
 Nobody out here is safe 
 Cuz shit out here ain't gravy 
 Cuz dawgs been crossin dawgs 
 Dats da shit dat been goin on lately 
 Everybody got a mask 
 Bitch out here like jason 
 I can be in da bed 
 Got dat bitch on safety 
 [Chorus]
