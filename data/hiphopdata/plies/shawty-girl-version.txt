Even though I'm not his girl, he ain't my man 
 He gonna call me his shawty 
 'Cause he can't stand to see me treated bad 
 I beat a bitch ass for my baby 
 And we ain't did nothin' that we ain't supposed to do 
 'Cause he my baby 
 Babyboy you know I be home, keep me on the ringtone baby 
 Sing it to me boy 
 Soon as he seen me, shit told me he'd pay for it 
 Lil mama the baddest thing 'round here & I already know it 
 He pointed at the donk and told me this supposed to be yours 
 Showed me a couple stacks and told me he'd let me blow it 
 The hottest nigga in the city baby I can't ignore it 
 He showed me he was a real nigga & I went for it 
 First time I caught him shit, I ain't even know how to throw it back 
 Now I'm an animal, he got my sex game right 
 He taught me how to talk to him while I take pipe 
 And opened me up and showed me what a real nigga like 
 He told me he don't usually do this, he don't fuck on the first night 
 Cause after he beat me baby he liable to fuck up ma whole life 
 He got me trained, now I suck him with ice 
 He call me his lil bust it baby 'cause I keep it tight 
 Whenever he tell me to bust, ain't gotta tell me twice 
 Whenever I wanna get off he know how to get me right 
 Even though I'm not his girl, he ain't my man 
 He gonna call me his shawty 
 'Cause he can't stand to see me treated bad 
 I beat a bitch ass for my baby 
 And we ain't did nothin' that we ain't supposed to do 
 'Cause he my baby 
 Babyboy you know I be home, keep me on the ringtone baby 
 Sing it to me boy 
 Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa 
 Whoa w-w-whoa shawty 
 He love to show me off, cause all the dope boys want me 
 Know why they wanna beat badly, look at all that ass on me 
 Look how that pussy sit up in them shorts, you know da gotta want me 
 He love when I act like I'm bo-legged and bend the corner 
 He proud to be fuckin' me, 'cause I'm stuntin on 'em 
 It feel good to be fuckin' a real chick don't'uh 
 Ain't called him in 2 days, gotta let his mind wonder 
 But when I miss him, I call to tell him to jump on me 
 That's why he don't mind breakin me off, 'cause I ain't with the drama 
 If you done ripped me before, you know how to cuff lil mama 
 You know I gotta be somethin', 'cause he done beat me under 
 He baby snatchin, he tellin' ya, he promise 
 He exposed me to real, & now I hate lame 
 Member I used to run from him, now I like pain 
 I call him sometimes just to ask is it my thing 
 Ever since he ran up in me shit I ain't been the same 
 Even though I'm not his girl, he ain't my man 
 He gonna call me his shawty 
 'Cause he can't stand to see me treated bad 
 I beat a bitch ass for my baby 
 And we ain't did nothin' that we ain't supposed to do 
 'Cause he my baby 
 Babyboy you know I be home, keep me on the ringtone baby 
 Sing it to me boy 
 Whoa w-w-whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
