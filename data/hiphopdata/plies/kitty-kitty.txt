 And you tryna get my attention

 I'm looking for the right kitty 
 Nice walk, nice fur 
 She got a real strong stand 
 With a real soft purr 
 Clean kitty who like 
 Hoes in the dirt 
 Wanna lay in yo lap 
 Rub her face in yo shirt 
 And she super, super timid 
 She don't like to move fur 
 Got a solid lil' frame 
 With a nice set of curves 
 And she sleep in a box 
 What I love about her 
 Love to hang by herself 
 Love to stand in front the mirror 
 Got nice long legs 
 Look good in her skirts 
 And I have this flow 
 When she ride in reverse 
 She don't never say much 
 When you feed her she just purr 
 You can play with her feet 
 Touch her tail, she jerks 
 She just like a kitty 
 Show her teeth when it hurt 
 Gotta lil' attitude 
 That can use a little work 
 Wanna make her close her eyes 
 Rub her stomach it works 
 If you want my attention 
 When you see me just purr 
 Here, kitty, kitty, kitty

 Wanna rub away them toes 
 Talk to her when I'm bored 
 Keep the kitty in the house 
 So it never get ignored 
 Wanna top notch kitty 
 Way everybody can't afford 
 Let the top straight back 
 Set that kitty in the Porsche 
 Drive the kitty round the city 
 Let the air cool her off 
 I'm a pat, pat, pat her 
 Every time the kitty cold 
 Keep her close to me 
 Don't want the kitty getting lost 
 You ain't ridding with a lame 
 Babe, you ridding with the boss 
 Got that nice set of eyes 
 Just like a lil' kitty 
 Run yo hands through her fur 
 'Cause her ass so pretty 
 How she follow you around 
 How you know when she with it 
 She purr, purr, purr 
 Every time you get it 
 In the middle of the club
