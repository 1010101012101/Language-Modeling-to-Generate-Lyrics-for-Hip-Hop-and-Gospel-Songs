Ay Homiee 
 Sometimes I just sit back and think homiee 
 What my life woulda really 
 Been like if it wasn't for my momma 
 Probally be dead or in a jam... 
 Probally be sittin' off in a pin 
 I wouldn't be strong as I am and life I wouldn't understand 
 Probally be dead or in a jam... 
 Probally be sittin' off in a pin 
 I wouldn't be strong as I am and life I wouldn't understand 
 Daddy left and momma stayed 
 And she raised ha boys showed us how to survive 
 When times get hard hustle when you want the thingsx you can't afford 
 Heres something to many times then don't ignore it without the bad the good you could'ntenjoy it 
 Loyalty when it's broke you can't restore it 
 Problems is apart of life that you can't avoid 
 Mama said in life everything can't be important she kept it simple when she said life was all about choices 
 Too many friends mama said equals too many voices in life you gotta learn how to walk before you can ride horses I guess I wouldn't be me 
 If mama got an abortion 
 Probally be dead or in a jam... 
 Probally be sittin' off in a pin 
 I wouldn't be strong as I am and life I wouldn't understand 
 Probally be dead or in a jam... 
 Probally be sittin' off in a pin 
 I wouldn't be strong as I am and life I wouldn't understand 
 I neva loved a woman 
 As much as I love my girl she neva showered me with gifts she showed me the world she taught me things about life 
 More valuable that pearls I think my daddy for haulin a... cause it made us more sterle 
 My momma slogan you ain't grown till ya payin' ya own billsx a real man love his family and he work and he live some things momma use to say I can hear in my ears 
 She told me don't call 'em ya friend till ya knoe who they is and if you hurt someone you love you wipe away they tears 
 You lookin' for love in these streets this ain't where it is and people remember you in life off the things you did your heart go always be judged 
 Off the things you give she said if you got 'em betta neva show the world your fears this world don't wanna see you happy they'd rather see you in tears 
 She said in mins you, you can destroy what you built in 
 Years she told me whateva you do die smart and real 
 Probally be dead or in a jam... 
 Probally be sittin' off in a pin 
 I wouldn't be strong as I am and life I wouldn't understand 
 Probally be dead or in a jam... 
 Probally be sittin' off in a pin 
 I wouldn't be strong as I am and life I wouldn't understand 
 She ain't have time to spend with us 
 'Cause she had three jobs my brotha tried to help us out so he went out and he rob 
 To watch my daddy make you cry it hurt me in my heart the only way I think you madee it you believed in God 
 I needed collateral on my bonds so you put up ya 
 House the only reason you did it cause you lovee ya child 
 And when thee streetsx tried to break me 
 You made me smilee you 
 Loved both of us 
 The same regardless how wild 
 I'm grown now but I still won't curse in ya house 
 My brother kids 
 You treat 'em all 
 Just like ya child when lost granny guess what you held us down 
 Between me and bro we hopee we made you proud
