I got a name in these streets 
 Plenty money to blow 
 Got whips 28's and jewelry to show 
 And ain't a ho I can't fuck I got ho's to loan 
 Just don't know if this shit worth goin' fed fo 
 As soon as a nigga get knocked the streets call him dumb 
 When this shit hit the fan everybody run 
 I don't know a nigga yet who did this shit and won 
 Money mean nothing to ya if you ain't got a bond 
 The streets scared now cause everybody getting hung 
 Lawyers sittin' back sucking all a nigga fund 
 Said it ain't cool when the rapper got the gun 
 This shit a game to these crackas and they having fun 
 The nigga you thought wouldn't tell will be the first one 
 It'll take number one fuck up and a nigga done 
 Visitation room that ain't how I wanna see my son 
 But I don't think about none of this shit when I'm stuntin 
 I got a name in these streets 
 Plenty money to blow 
 Got whips 28's and jewelry to show 
 And ain't a ho I can't fuck I got ho's to loan 
 Just don't know if this shit worth goin' fed fo 
 I don't know if 25 years worth 2 years of ballin 
 That's a big pill to take and I ain't trynna swallow it 
 Fuck round and get jammed and all this shit falling 
 Take the streets from a nigga then a nigga starving 
 Tried to let it go the money kept calling 
 Streets been good to me got a nigga flossing 
 Same shit a nigga love be the shit that cost him 
 Money make niggas hate turn niggas salty 
 Go to prison now don't take me from my shawty 
 Bout time I get out he gon be off in college 
 Game fucked up now cause all these niggas talking 
 I'm a street nigga I ain't got too many options 
 I got a name in these streets 
 Plenty money to blow 
 Got whips 28's and jewelry to show 
 And ain't a ho I can't fuck I got ho's to loan 
 Just don't know if this shit worth goin' fed fo 
 Nigga always told me to get in this shit and get out 
 But he ain't tell me bout all the laws and all the drama 
 You back to square one after a nigga break into your house 
 It's hard to come up shit when you gotta keep burnin out 
 Is cars jewelry and ho's what it's all about 
 I don't know it lil daddy I just want a nice amount 
 Just gave my lil cousin eleven years for an ounce 
 You broke and fuckin' with these ho's they gon ask you to bounce 
 And niggas buying shit now they can't even pronounce 
 Done fucked up so much money shit can't even count 
 Hope I don't wake up one morning with them crackas in my house 
 With guns drawn on me and with enditment papers out 
 I got a name in these streets 
 Plenty money to blow 
 Got whips 28's and jewelry to show 
 And ain't a ho I can't fuck I got ho's to loan 
 Just don't know if this shit worth goin' fed fo
