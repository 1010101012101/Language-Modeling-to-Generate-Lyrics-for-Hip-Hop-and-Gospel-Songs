(Intro: Speaking) 
 Man I hope y'all can excuse me for a little minute man. Just sitting here thinking about my lil partner who just got killed 
 It's wild dog, how the mother fucker you love the most, seem like them the ones who always die first 
 Dog I just wish I had the opportunity to just bring my nigga back for 1 day hommie. 
 Wish I could bring my nigga back for 1 day, taking by the daycare to see his son play 
 Then go to show'em how his baby mom then went astray 
 And how the fuck niggas that claim they love him then walked away [x2] 
 God give me my nigga for 24 hours, so we can ride and laugh at these pussy ass cowards 
 Hit the liquor store, park and just talk for hours 
 Show'em how after a nigga die, how they loose they power 
 Nigga forget about you dog, after they give you them flowers 
 O'l tryflin ass baby mom, then got wilder 
 Now she fucking that nigga you robbed with the pink impala 
 And like I told you before dog that hoe sour 
 And you can fuck these hoes dog but don't howl em 
 Bitch you ain't got shit dog, money arouse them 
 After a nigga dead and gone they loose they value 
 Hoe cried at your funeral, and changed right after 
 Wish I could bring my nigga back for 1 day, taking by the daycare to see his son play 
 Then go to show'em how his baby mom then went astray 
 And how the fuck niggas that claim they love him then walked away [x2] 
 When you first died niggas set around your momma all day 
 But since your funeral them niggas ain't went that fucking way 
 Thought when you die your dog suppose step to the plate 
 You ain't got to worry, I gotta I'm make sure she straight 
 Make you question if the love was real or was it fake 
 Outta sight, outta mind guess it's true what they say 
 When you was here them was the main niggas in your face 
 You ain't gotta deal with them fuck niggas, you in a better place 
 I almost cried when I seen your son the other day 
 You couldn't deny that one, boy look like you all the way 
 I thought love was forever, I guess that ain't the case 
 First you die, then they bury u, then niggas walk away 
 Wish I could bring my nigga back for 1 day, taking by the daycare to see his son play 
 Then go to show'em how his baby mom then went astray 
 And how the fuck niggas that claim they love him then walked away [x2] 
 I'm sitting right here hommie, eyes full a tears 
 Never thought that pain last this many years 
 One thing I learned from all this shit, life real 
 Rep your name till I die, hommie that's how I feel 
 Watched how everything changed, since you got killed 
 Two days after you died, niggas broke in your crib 
 Niggas saying your lil cousin, the one who stole your wheel 
 This shit probably shouldn't fuck with me, but it really is 
 Motherfuckers showed me what shisty really is 
 What going to happen after I die, one of my biggest fears 
 Seeing what my partner then been through, got me scared as hell 
 I pray the god my life don't end like his 
 Wish I could bring my nigga back for 1 day, taking by the daycare to see his son play 
 Then go to show'em how his baby mom then went astray 
 And how the fuck niggas that claim they love him then walked away [x2]
