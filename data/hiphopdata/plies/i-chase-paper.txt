Oh, it's Plies again (I chase paper) 
 Aye, I just had somebody come up to me and ask me (I chase paper) 
 "What do you do for a living? (I chase paper) 
 I told 'em, "I chase paper, what da fuck do you do?" (I chase paper) 
 If you wanna know what my occupation is, homie... 
 I chase paper (Twenty), I chase paper (Four) 
 I chase paper (Seven), I chase paper (Homie) 
 I chase paper (Monday), I chase paper (Through) 
 I chase paper (Sunday), I chase paper (homie) 
 I Chase Paper 
 Hustle now, sleep when I'm dead 
 Niggas with paper, they go FED 
 Grandma told me, that's where I'm headin' 
 Gon' chase paper, can't be scared 
 All I know, I won't beg 
 Owe me paper, I want my bread 
 Don't wanna pay, I want yo head 
 Yoppa loaded, under my bed 
 Gon' chase paper till I'm dead 
 How much paper it's gon' take 
 Just for me to be straight 
 Me to be rich, I can't wait 
 All I do is paper chase 
 Ion't got time, I can't wait 
 'Cause I need millions on my plate 
 I chase paper, all day 
 I chase paper (Twenty), I chase paper (Four) 
 I chase paper (Seven), I chase paper (Homie) 
 I chase paper (Monday), I chase paper (Through) 
 I chase paper (Sunday), I chase paper (homie) 
 I Chase Paper 
 Wake up early, lookin' for a check 
 Till I get rich, I can't rest 
 Broke and black, now that's stress 
 Wanna break bread wit' me, be my guest 
 When I got paper, I'm at my best 
 Only money can fix my mess 
 Tired of Chevy's, I want jets 
 All I need is one big lick 
 I want now, Ion't want next 
 I want paper, he don't want shit 
 I want mansions, he want a bitch 
 That's the last thang on my list 
 Without paper, I am sick 
 Paper ain't there, I want it 
 I chase paper till I quit 
 The mo' I hustle the mo' I get 
 I chase paper (Twenty), I chase paper (Four) 
 I chase paper (Seven), I chase paper (Homie) 
 I chase paper (Monday), I chase paper (Through) 
 I chase paper (Sunday), I chase paper (homie) 
 I Chase Paper 
 I lost it all, I almost cried 
 Can't sleep, I got bags under my eyes 
 I need paper, fuck bein' tied 
 I need paper, mo' than I do a wife 
 If I go broke, I would die 
 Hustle longer than nine to five 
 Can't be broke, got too much pride 
 What's after broke, suicide 
 Been chasin' paper all my life 
 They hatin' on me, that's all right 
 I need haters, they my high 
 Easy gettin' the mo' you try 
 Paper chaser, that is I 
 Hundred mil', still won't retire 
 My brother in prison, chasin' it now 
 Say Ion't chase paper, that's a lie 
 I chase paper (Twenty), I chase paper (Four) 
 I chase paper (Seven), I chase paper (Homie) 
 I chase paper (Monday), I chase paper (Through) 
 I chase paper (Sunday), I chase paper (homie) 
 I Chase Paper 
 Oh, I know all about chasin' paper, bra 
 Three albums in sixteen months, homie 
 I'm all about chasin' paper 
 This how we comin' out the gates, homie 
 Da REAList in stores December 16th 
 What time it is, bra? 
 5:22 in the mornin', bra, AM 
 Either they hatin' or they tryna be just like me, man
