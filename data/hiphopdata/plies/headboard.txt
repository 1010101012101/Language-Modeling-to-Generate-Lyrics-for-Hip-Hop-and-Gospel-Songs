 Got you up against the headboard 
 Got your body swingin' like ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Baby, grab the headboard 
 Make it go, make it go, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Girl, I want you to get on top of me 
 And grind nasty until I feel body heat 
 I make your head hit the headboard 'til it squeak 
 I'll put it on ya, have you thinking 'bout me for a week 
 And I'ma make sure that she feel it 'cause I'm goin' deep 
 Yeah, I'ma take all of my stress out under these sheets 
 Since you think you can handle me, then we'll feel and see

 Let me stuff this pillow behind the headboard 
 'Cause if I don't do that, it's going to make too much noise 
 Ain't pop no pill but I am really hard 
 What you want in your stomach, a girl or a boy? 
 How you want me to start it, tongue or the toy? 
 I can tell you what I want, Becky my first choice 
 And I ain't stopping tonight until I getcha hoarse 
 Cut that duck in half 'cause she is so moist 
 Got her going, she loose, I hear it in her voice 
 Can tell how she move that she can ride a horse 
 Don't change a thing, you on the right course 
 I did all the work so you gon' have a boy 
 We be in the bed, girl getting all wild 
 Fuckin' like it's goin' out of style 
 You be like yeah, yeah, getting all loud 
 Fuckin' like we trying to have a child

 Got your body screamin' like ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Baby, grab the headboard 
 Make it go, make it go, ooh, ooh, ooh

 And I got stamina so I'ma be here for a while 
 20 years old, but I stroke it like I'm 35 
 20 years old, but I stroke it like I'm 35 
 Baby, I wanna make your body cry down below 
 Now watch I'll dive all the way to the ocean floor 
 Her legs started shakin' that's when I lost control 
 I wanna kiss you from your belly button to your toes

 You know what up hostella, I'ma get you that groovin' 
 Then I'ma tell you what I'm doing to you while I'm doing it

 Got you up against the headboard 
 Got your body screamin' like ooh, ooh, ooh
