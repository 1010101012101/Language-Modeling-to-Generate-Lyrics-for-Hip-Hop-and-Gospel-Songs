There's people in the world, 
 Everyday they hide they problems, 
 They don't want nobody to judge em 
 So they just keep it inside of em 
 They smile when you see em 
 'Cause they don't want you to know somethin' botherin em 
 But when they all along they just cryin in the shower 
 Your bills done got behind gotcha scared to check ya mail box 
 Seem like err body askin for all the things you don't got 
 Err body depend on you 
 But you can't never get shit that they got 
 You did stuff for people 
 When you could have been helping yourself out 
 Your heart is good but it don't got you in some bad spots 
 You bills keep piling up, it seem like they won't stop 
 The economy done got bad, you ain't got money like you used to 
 But who seems to cares when all these bills and the rent due 
 And sometime it seem like hell you done been through 
 And sometimes your biggest critics are people you kin to 
 Why people judge you off the things that you didn't do 
 But you keep it to yourself, no body to turn to

 Her momma always told her if she got pregnant she better be married 
 She ain't wanna do but she was too afraid to have it 
 She ain't tell nobody including the dude that got her pregnant 
 This whole decision had been fuckin' with her daily 
 And uh all she thinking bout is god gone hate me and uh 
 What he gone say about her decision making and 
 Cryin in the shower that's the only rest haven and

 And she's only 14 which makes it even more crazy 'cause
