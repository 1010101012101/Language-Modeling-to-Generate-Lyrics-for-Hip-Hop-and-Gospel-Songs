Intro - Plies talking: 
 Aye, man, muthafucka just told me to pull my pants up homie (What?) 
 Pull my pants up, I went up to that muthafucka 
 And told him I'm from the hood and that's how shit go 
 Chorus - Plies: 
 I let my pants (My Pants) Hang low (Hang low) 
 I'm from the hood and this how shit go (I'm from the hood) 
 I let my pants (My pants) hang low (Hang low) 
 So, you better not play with my dough 
 'Cause if you do, 4, 4 (4, 4) 
 I'm from the hood and that's how shit go 
 I let my pants my pants, hang low (Hang low) 
 I'm from the hood and that's how shit go 
 Verse 1 - Plies: 
 I'm from the home of goon, city of the choppas 
 You ain't 'bout that life, you ain't want no problems 
 If you sweet and you know it, fuck it gone rob ya 
 Want straight yappas, fuck with no revolvers 
 Real street nigga, need a real good lawyer 
 Last two cases, bought four charges 
 In the hood, couple rules that you must follow 
 If you don't then, slugs'a be in your body 
 Want my paper, get my shawty 
 Hustle all day, try to ride big body 
 Been with three dope boys, hood call 'em garbage 
 Will I still fuck'a, I don't know, yeah, prolly 
 Just a hood nigga with alot of swag shawty 
 Who I hang with the most, prolly my 40 
 Been labeled a goon, that's what the hood call me 
 Stay in the hood, till I die homie, that's regardless 
 Chorus - Plies: 
 I let my pants (My Pants) Hang low (Hang low) 
 I'm from the hood and this how shit go (I'm from the hood) 
 I let my pants (My pants) hang low (Hang low) 
 So, you better not play with my dough 
 'Cause if you do, 4, 4 (4, 4) 
 I'm from the hood and that's how shit go 
 I let my pants my pants, hang low (Hang low) 
 I'm from the hood and that's how shit go 
 Hook - Plies: 
 Say I'm too hood, might be 
 Don't give a damn what you think about me 
 Say I'ma goon, that's me 
 Don't give a damn what you think about me, nigga 
 Verse 2 - Plies: 
 This where you find the most snitches, and most guns 
 Go four little parnters right now, on the run 
 Half of the city fellas supposed to have got warned 
 Guns stay swole every first of the month 
 If you ain't got 5, you better not stunt 
 Hood cut throat, can't even front 
 Bentley all right, get more attention than the donk 
 No shirt, pants saggin' with big charm 
 If it ain't top of the line, I don't want that blunt 
 Geeked in this trap, come through the front 
 Jack boys ridin', tryna find what they want 
 Ball last night, 4 g's what I spun 
 Before you fuckin' wit me, better take his lunch 
 'Cause, if you get behind me, then I'm gon' punch 
 554's under the hood, will run 
 'Cause I'm from the hood, and this is how it done 
 Chorus - Plies: 
 I let my pants (My Pants) Hang low (Hang low) 
 I'm from the hood and this how shit go (I'm from the hood) 
 I let my pants (My pants) hang low (Hang low) 
 So, you better not play with my dough 
 'Cause if you do, 4, 4 (4, 4) 
 I'm from the hood and that's how shit go 
 I let my pants my pants, hang low (Hang low) 
 I'm from the hood and that's how shit go 
 Hook - Plies: 
 Say I'm too hood, might be 
 Don't give a damn what you think about me 
 Say I'ma goon, that's me 
 Don't give a damn what you think about me, nigga
