My body feel numb 
 My heart beatin' fast 
 My mind still racin' 
 My nerves gettin' bad 
 My body language weak 
 My face expression sad 
 Been stripped of my emotions 
 Feel like I been stabbed 
 I don't know what I would do 
 If my nigga passed 
 Emotional rollercoaster 
 When it's over I'll be glad 
 Can't do nothin' about itself 
 It's startin' to make me mad 
 I feel so helpless 
 My partner all I have 
 After this is all over 
 Gotta put my heart into care 
 I feel so empty 
 How long will it last? 
 Ain't nothin' in the world that you can do right now 
 That can make me laugh 
 Feel like I'm cryin' 
 But ain't no tears shed 
 My partner just got shot 
 They say he might die 
 Niggas caught him sleeping 
 Hit him from both sides 
 I'm crying internally 
 But no tears won't come out my eyes 
 I just realized 
 I don't know how to cry 
 My partner just got shot 
 I heard he might die 
 Niggas caught him sleeping 
 Hit him it from both sides 
 I'm crying internally 
 But no tears won't come out my eyes 
 I just realized 
 I don't know how to cry 
 My shirt's stickin' to me 
 'Cause it's full of sweat 
 My eyes real heavy 
 It's hard to get some rest 
 I'm worryin' myself crazy 
 I can feel it in my chest 
 I'm thinkin' bout' my nigga 
 It's hard to catch my breath 
 I know if I lose him now 
 Don't know what I'd do next 
 Momma told me "Pray more baby, 
 And worry less" 
 Ever since I got the news 
 I been emotional wreck 
 Don't know if it's all a dream 
 Or if it's just a test 
 He had tubes in his nose 
 Some runnin' out his neck 
 Can't even look at my nigga 
 Can't stand to see him like that 
 I feel all his pain 
 I'm under so much stress 
 I just hope he make it 
 'Cause I know he blessed 
 My partner just got shot 
 They say he might die 
 Niggas caught him sleeping 
 Hit him from both sides 
 I'm crying internally 
 But no tears won't come out my eyes 
 I just realized 
 I don't know how to cry 
 My partner just got shot 
 I heard he might die 
 Niggas caught him sleeping 
 Hit him from both sides 
 I'm crying internally 
 But no tears won't come out my eyes 
 I just realized 
 I don't know how to cry
