I'm lookin' for one female 
 That I can turn into a spoiled brat 
 I wanna spoil you seven days a week 
 I'll buy you Gucci and Prada 
 And fly you all around the world 
 Because you so much hotter 
 Than all them other girls 
 So when we coolin' on the Eastside 
 You coolin' with me 
 But when you pull up in that new ride 
 This is all they gon' say, hey! 
 Damn right, she got it good 
 Hell yeah, she got it made 
 Damn right, she got it good 
 Hell yeah, she got it made 
 Millionaire-like status, I can make yours the same 
 Big crib, nice whips, I can get it all arranged 
 I can get your own chauffeur, I can put you on a plane 
 Clear stones, nice diamonds, I can put it 'em your ring 
 Big rocks, flawless ice, I can put it in your chain 
 Nice weight, nice hips, I can put it on your frame 
 Buy you stocks, buy you bonds, I can put it 'em in your name 
 If you like to ride candy, I can put you in the paint 
 If you like top shelf, I can put it in your drank 
 If you need a lil' paper, I can put it in your bank 
 If you need a lil' sex, I can drop it in your tank 
 If you ever get cold, I can put you in a mink 
 I'll buy you Gucci and Prada 
 And fly you all around the world 
 Because you so much hotter 
 Than all them other girls 
 So when we coolin' on the Eastside 
 You coolin' with me 
 But when you pull up in that new ride 
 This is all they gon' say, hey! 
 Damn right, she got it good 
 Hell yeah, she got it made 
 Damn right, she got it good 
 Hell yeah, she got it made 
 I can make you everyday look like a big time model 
 I can spoil you everyday and have you livin' on the water 
 All 5-star suites, we ain't doin' no remodels 
 You ain't got to cook baby, all you gotta do is order 
 If you ever with me, you ain't got to spend a quarter 
 Own beautician baby, all you got to do is call her 
 Gotta closet full of purses, everyone of 'em I done bought 'em 
 Got your teacup Yorkie just to match with your Prada 
 Wanna tear down Bell Harbor, all you got to do is holler 
 Let you act a lil' streeter, let you drink out of the bottle 
 Send you on vacation with your girls and your momma 
 Wanna stay a whole month, you can stay as long as you wanna 
 I'll buy you Gucci and Prada 
 And fly you all around the world 
 Because you so much hotter 
 Than all them other girls 
 So when we coolin' on the Eastside 
 You coolin' with me 
 But when you pull up in that new ride 
 This is all they gon' say, hey! 
 Damn right, she got it good 
 Hell yeah, she got it made 
 Damn right, she got it good 
 Hell yeah, she got it made
