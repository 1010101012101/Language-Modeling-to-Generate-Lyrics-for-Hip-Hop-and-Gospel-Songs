Hey man all my niggas out here 
 Man who out here like me dawg 
 Who out here head first my nigga 
 Chasin these street dreams dawg 
 Lets fall back man 
 Let me talk for you real quick homie 
 God man its just some thing I wanna talk to you about man i 
 I know right now I'm probably, 
 Probably the last nigga you wanna hear from 
 You know man I just wanna you to know god man I'm tied of lyin' to you 
 God I want you to know I'm so tired of lyin' to you 
 I don't even know the reason why in the fuck I even lie to you 
 So if you stop fuckin' wit me right now I understand 
 But I guess that would leave out here thug on my own then [x2] 
 I told them motha fuckers if I die they don't know where I go 
 Cause alot of us out that that we think goin' to heaven that just ain't gonna go 
 And some of us go to church every Sunday and still ain't gonna go 
 God I lie to you to much that the reason don't know where I'm gonna go 
 I remember the little hoe butt that I told that I wasn't gonna fuck raw no more 
 I guess what I shouldve said that I wasn't gonna fuck her raw no more 
 And after my homeboy got killed I promise you I was gonna start come to church 
 But instead of comin' to church I jump in the game head first 
 It seems like weddings and funernals the only time I step foot in church 
 But if I was locked up right now shit ud be my bestfriend 
 Cause that when nigga seem like they at lowest point of there life then 
 My dawg locked and every time I talk to him god all I'm hearin 
 I like I told him them cracker let him out tomorrow he'll back robbin again 
 And I don't know why we sit down and lie to you about some fuck shit 
 And like they say the one that love you get there ass to kiss 
 I guess that's the best way to explain me and your relationship 
 I told my mama "shit, god must be a pain freak" 
 Cause after all these lies and broken promises 
 Dawg still fuck wit me 
 And I'm gonna be honest wit you god shit I wouldn't even fuck wit me 
 But when I was on my dick shit you could stop hearin from me 
 And soon as my money got straight shit you stop hearin from me 
 And after my brother gone and died I promised you I thought wit the dope game 
 And as soon as them 22's come out I got right back in the dope game 
 And I remember bein on my knees throwin' up my insides 
 Have heavy yak in my system felt like I was about to fuckin' gonna die 
 I told you I wasn't gonna drink no more shit there go another lie 
 I know one day all this thugin shit got to come to an end 
 I understand that one day my life got to come to an end 
 God man its just, 
 Just so much fucked up wit me right now 
 Man just tiring be out here and you know tiring to get money 
 And fuck wit all these hoes 
 And you know i-i-i find time for everything else, 
 But seem like I don't never got no time for you 
 My grandma always tell me man

 Man and and give my life over to god man 
 And god you just know man just right now man you better know than anybody man 
 U just you just know I'm full of shit you know I ain't fitin do right right now 
 I don't know if this gonna effect you know what I'm sayin' me me gettin' into heaven 
 But you know I just want you to know man I'm I'm just tired of lyin' to you man 
 And I feel that like if I'm gonna deal wit you 
 I feel like I should deal wit you like you a real nigga 
 I don't know why you I've seen the I've seen the lag fourgers 
 Man you shit I know you probably feel like I'm bull shitin you right now 
 But you know god man i-i-i just want you to know man I'm tired of lyin' to you man 
 And I just feel like if I'm gonna fuck wit you I need to fuck wit you all the way
