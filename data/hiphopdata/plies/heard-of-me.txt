 Boy I think I'm bout go 'n' all the way on this one (have you heard of me) 
 One thing about me home boy I don't play no muthafuckin games (have you heard of me) 
 Kept it muthafuckin gutta from day one right now homie the streets 
 I run how am this hot and a award I ain't won 
 'Cause I ain't a industry nigga all right son 
 But you will pay me for what I've done take tha industry relationship 
 'Cause I don't want none don't want the fame of this shit 
 You can have it shoulda just took tha money and then run 
 That ain't how a real nigga play it where I'm from stay 
 And get the whole thing and then sum I dun sold gold 
 What's next platinum dun sold ova a million records ain't that sumthin 
 May neva see me on tha cover of a magazine 
 'Cause I ain't willin' 2 kiss be seen copperate mad at me 
 Cause dey can't fuck me I'm who these haterz hatin' 
 I'm 3rd degree say I'm to gutta homie 4 TV 
 I'm who these white folks don't want they kids 2 see 
 But I'm the new owners of these fuckin' streets go 
 By tha name of plies have you heard of me. 
 Erre since me erre body claiming real most you niggas pussy 
 That's how I feel can be the best rapper an gotta tell lies 
 I couldn't be dat cause all I do is fantasize how you cookin dope you wearin suites 'n' ties 
 This industry a joke they publicize just don't go to yo parties 
 If you don't fuck with plies to all my fans I apologize 
 Want me to cross ova fuck dat side jus a real nigga out of Ft. Meyers 
 I got principles nigga dats wat I live by

 Not 1 my 3 album is you surprised worth my investment 
 Ask atlantic records do I let shit slide ring tone numbas 1.5 
 Copperate scared of me 'cause I ain't safe dey don't know 
 Wat da fuck dat I might say in da type of game dat they play 
 I don't wear tight jeans or rock shades umma trendsetter 
 I go my own way I make it hard on the radio 
 Dat the streets praise you can stop countin' on questions 
 Dese days ever heard of a nigga dat say fuck me nigga 
 Either a rapper or a wannabe jus want me to kill 'em on gp 
 Say I ain't lyrical well I'm sorry be dropped out of college 
 Ain't earned my degree but at my bank dey love me his favorite rapper 
 Ain't hot but he mad at me I can make me hot for a small fee 
 Da streets don't want 'em I'm sorry
