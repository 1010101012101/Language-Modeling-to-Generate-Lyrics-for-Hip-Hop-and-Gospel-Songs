(Intro: Plies - talkin') 
 I know sum people that say money change thangs 
 I'm hear to tell you money don't change every muthafuckin thing 
 Last ten years momma been workin' twice a day 
 Grandma on a kidney machine, she done lost all the weight 
 My aunty got AIDS, she startin' to lose her faith 
 My brutha back in prison, second time he gone away 
 My daddy still smokin' dat shit I can see it in his face 
 My cousin 16 pregnant from a nigga 38 
 Tryna stay on my son, make sure he doin' what his mama say 
 Before ya take me God, help me get my family straight 
 I asked God why he didn't bless me with a silver spoon 
 'Cause if he did I'd never have to be a goon 
 If he gon' change my family, I hope he change it soon 
 I'm tired of answerin' my phone hearin' bad news 
 My grandma on a walker she can barely move 
 Just to tell me she love me take all her breath to do 
 She on a kidney machine I know it's hurtin' her 2 
 Four times a week gotta get her blood drew 
 She say the bible and prayer the only thing that get her through 
 Why my grandma deserve this, god what did she do? 
 Thought caus' I had a lil money I could buy her a new 
 She hold the family together, she one I can't loose 
 My aunty got AIDS and I'm watchin her suffer 
 Why she gotta die caus' she was in love with a hustler 
 Even tho she's dying she say she still love him 
 I know if I see him again I'll kill dat muthafucker 
 Only get 15 minutes to talk to my brutha 
 'Cause he in prison gotta go see him if I wanna hug him 
 Sum niggas willin' to lose their freedom just for thuggin' 
 Caus' he made a mistake gotta be here caus' I love him 
 Uncle just called me found out his daughter fuckin', 
 Fuckin' when they get 14 now like its nothing 
 In da hood it's happenin' 10 out of a dozen 
 Dat nigga her daddy age dat is fuckin' my lil cousin 
 My daddy damn near 50 still livin' with his momma 
 Can't even have a family reunion caus' it's always drama 
 Last three months I dun lost both of my uncles 
 Why my family luck so bad, I sit and wonder 
 We ain't close like we should and its taken us under 
 The only time we come together is to have a funeral 
 Sit around and talk about each other and spread rumors 
 Know it's some of my fault caus' I don't talk to 'em 
 For my family to be happy, that's all I want 
 Help my grandma fight, god I know she don't 
 To see my mama retire, that's all I want 
 Hope my brutha get out to see his kids for once.
