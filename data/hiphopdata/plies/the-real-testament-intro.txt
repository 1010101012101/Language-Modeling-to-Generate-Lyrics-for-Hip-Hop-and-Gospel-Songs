Hey I like to welcome all you muthafuckers To the real testament 
 This where the truth get told 
 And bullshit ain't tolerated 
 Before I sell my soul 
 I'll lose everything 
 You can lock me up cracker I'm a get out and do the same thing 
 You can take this rap shit from me I'll find another game 
 Don't get this shit confused 
 Nigga this was never my dream 
 Been through what I seen 
 I'd rather kill myself 
 Before I'll live a lie 
 Before I'll turn informal 
 Nigga I'd rahter fry 
 My mama lost me to the streets I told her don't cry 
 Told her if she understood real 
 She should understand why 
 The wrong slip in these streets 
 And crackerz had your lifeHad plenty of money and never paid tithe 
 Nigga was cought up in this thuggin' I apoligize 
 You call the nigga your dog 
 But will he really ride 
 Nigga know how to get money 
 But will he testify 
 Give a fuck why you told 
 Snitchin' somethin' I can't buy 
 Rather I sell a hundred thousand 
 Or I sell a mill 
 Fact remain the same 
 Nigga I'm still real 
 Broke my heart they gave my Lil homey 15 year 
 I put a cast on my heart in place of the tears 
 He told me plies I'm livin' through you 
 While I been here 
 The realest shit I ever heard 
 That shit gave me chills 
 I'm a get that time off him 
 If it's gods will 
 Don't know when god comin' 
 That's my only fear 
 Been drankin' since I was 16 
 Help me think clear 
 Don't come to my funeral 
 If I ain't fuck with you while I was here 
 Some fuck niggas in the county now 
 Tryin' to get me in there 
 But niggas in hell want ice water 
 So I don't care 
 The opposite of you fuck niggas 
 Cause you a square 
 I know of some fuck niggas 
 That hate me who I ain't never met 
 Never talked to me 
 Never even seem me yet 
 The only thing they know I'm where they tryin' to get 
 The only thing they I know 
 Respect it or check it 
 'Cause I don't know yout shit I been dealin' with envy nigga 
 Every since I was a git 
 Hated my many loved by the same 
 So I'm even bitch 
 Put my hand on the bible 
 Swear to tell the truth 
 You liked to here lies 
 This the wrong CD to listen to nigga.
