I'll be pulling it down in a minute 
 How long will it take before you screamin' my name 
 Oh baby, you should rip off my clothes and get naked 
 I'll be like Oh yeah 
 You'll be like Oh Yeah 
 Hot enough up in here 
 Makin' her sweat 
 Your little pedicure up on my chest 
 And we goin' sweat, sweat, sweat 
 I'll be like Oh Yeah 
 You'll be like Oh yeah 
 Makin' her sweat 
 (Verse 1: Plies) 
 What's my biggest turn on in a women? 
 One that's flexible 
 I'm talkin' her limbs not her schedule 
 If you ain't it's still cool 
 Baby I can work witcha 
 I been doin' it a long time 
 Bring out the best in ya 
 Bring it to yo front door drop off like a messenger 
 Jewelry is real long I go hard like a Mexican 
 First two pumps shawty that's what's after president 
 Kiss you on yo bo jay jay 
 Rage ya out ya element 
 Last one I ran crazy 
 She got on that peppermint 
 She was out the hood though but mo' with an accent 
 Shawty show stuff never seen 
 Hit her with the backspin 
 She say that I'm X rated, 
 I say that I'm confident 
 Seen her with her boots on make me want it right there 
 I know she got that repeat she turn me on [?] 
 She told me boy you know what good and I replied Amen 
 Late night plus liquor she know it equals long and we gone 
 (Chorus: Chris Brown) 
 I'll be pulling it down in a minute 
 How long will it take before you screamin' my name 
 Oh baby, you should rip off my clothes and get naked 
 I'll be like Oh yeah 
 You'll be like Oh Yeah 
 Hot enough up in here 
 Makin' her sweat 
 Your little pedicure up on my chest 
 And we goin' sweat, sweat, sweat 
 I'll be like Oh Yeah 
 You'll be like Oh yeah 
 Makin' her sweat 
 (Verse 2: Plies)

 She be trying to hold it in 
 But I be wanting talk 
 She be hollin' put it on

 Interior rear did ducking high moss 
 I always tell her "baby act like I gotta go to court" 
 Act like this the last time I'm walkin'; through yo doo'

 She be wantin' to go to sleep but I don't even wanna go 
 I be on the couch [?] 
 I'm actin' like a Don King hollerin' round 4 
 (Chorus: Chris Brown) 
 I'll be pulling it down in a minute 
 How long will it take before you screamin' my name 
 Oh baby, you should rip off my clothes and get naked 
 I'll be like Oh yeah 
 You'll be like Oh Yeah 
 Hot enough up in here 
 Makin' her sweat 
 Your little pedicure up on my chest, 
 And we goin' sweat, sweat, sweat
