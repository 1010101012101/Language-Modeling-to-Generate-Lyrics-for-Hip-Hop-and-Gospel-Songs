It's amazin to me homie 
 That niggas you fuck wit dawg 
 You don't know tha truth about these niggas until y'all fall out homie 
 The mo you show a nigga 
 Tha mo dangerous he become to you homie*Chorus* 
 I Broke Bread Wit you Nigga 
 Showed you Where I Lived 
 U Taught Me Nigga 
 But you Don't Understand Wat Real Is 
 When It Came To You Pussy Ass Nigga I Woulda Killed 
 But It Was My Fault Nigga 
 I Kept It Too Real 
 {Repeat 2 x's} 
 We Busted Choppaz At Niggaz 
 Layed In Bushes Together 
 U Had Me Fooled Dawg I Thought you Was My Fuckin' Nigga 
 Woulda Did A 100 Years For U 
 'Cause I Fuck Wit Ya 
 U Taught Me Wat A Good Heart In These Streetz Would Get A Nigga 
 Not A Muthafuckin Thing But A Sad Picture 
 Hurt Me When I Found Out you Had Pussy In Yo Heart Nigga 
 I Never Thought I'd Say It 
 But Muthafuck A Friend 
 'Cause Yo Dawg Be Tha One That Cross Ya In Tha End 
 Tha Shit I Know Now 
 Wish Id Done Knew It Bak Then 
 But Goin' Through It Wit A Fuck Nigga Is Wat Make A Man 
 I Treated Yo Pussy Ass Betta Than I Did My Own Kin 
 When A Nigga Locked Up Or Broke That's When They Claim They Luv you Then 
 *Chrous* 
 I Broke Bread Wit you Nigga Showed you Where I Lived 
 U Talkin' Nigga But you Don't Understand Wat Real Is 
 When It Came To Yo Pussy Ass Nigga I Woulda Killed 
 But It Was My Fault Nigga I Kept It Too Real 
 {Repeat 2 x's} 
 Wat Was Mine 
 Was Yours 
 But Wat was Yours 
 Wasnt Mine 
 If A Nigga Woulda Told Me you Was Flaw 
 I Woulda Thought He Was Lyin' 
 But Every Nigga Gon Show His Hand In Due Time 
 I Kept It So Muthafuckin Real Wit you That I Was Blind 
 'Cause I Was Too Busy Showin Luv 
 I Ain't See Tha Signs 
 When you Needed Me Pussy 
 I Came Through Everytime 
 Whether you Was Right Or Wrong 
 Fuk Nigga I Was Ridin' 
 But you Envied Me Nigga In Tha Bak Of Yo Mind 
 U Wasnt A 100 Nigga 
 U Was Real Part Time 
 I Broke you Off When Them Fuck Niggaz Wouldn't Give U A Dime 
 Ain't Owe you Shit Nigga 
 I Just Wanted To See you Shine 
 U Never Gave Me Shit Nigga 
 I Had My Own Grind 
 I Ain't Need Yo Choppaz 
 I Had My Own Iron 
 I'm A 100 Nigga 
 I Done Did Me And Yo Time 
 U Can't Trust Yo Own Homiez 
 Who Tha Fuck Can you Trust 
 I Got My Bruda 
 And My Choppa 
 So To Me That's Enough 
 I Broke Bread Wit you Nigga 
 Showed you Where I Lived 
 U Talkin' Nigga 
 But you Don't Understand Wat Real Is 
 When It Came To You Pussy Ass Nigga I Woulda Killed 
 But It Was My Fault Nigga 
 I Kept It Too Real 
 {Repeat 2 x's} 
 And God Ain't Makin' you Fuck Niggaz Like He Used To 
 A Nigga Believe his hoe Now 
 Fo' He Believe U 
 And 'Cause you Thug Wit A Nigga 
 Don't Mean Tha Luv Tru 
 It Used To Matter Wat you And Yo Niggaz Done Been Through 
 Nigga Be Yo Dawg One Day 
 And Turn Pussy Out Tha Blue 
 A Fuck Nigga Gon Do 
 Wat A Fuck Nigga Gon Do 
 Betta Off Runnin' By Yoself If you Only Knew 
 Don't Mean That Nigga A Hunter 'Cause He'll Fuckin' Shoot 
 And Money Don't Mean you Real 'Cause He Got Loot 
 If A Nigga Heart Ain't Right 
 No Tellin' Wat He'll Do 
 And Real Niggaz Extinct 
 Its Only A Fuckin' Few 
 'Cause 99% Of These Fuk Niggaz Ain't Tru 
 I Broke Bread Wit you Nigga 
 Showed you Where I Lived 
 U Talkin' Nigga 
 But you Don't Understand Wat Real Is 
 When It Came To You Pussy Ass Nigga I Woulda Killed 
 But It Was My Fault Nigga 
 I Kept It Too Real 
 {Repeat 2 x's}
