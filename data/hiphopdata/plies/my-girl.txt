You can take my cars, all my cash, my whole world 
 You can take my fame, all my jewels, just leave me my girl 
 Just me and my girl 
 My girl (6x) 
 Just me and my girl 
 My girl (6x) 
 Its about 5 in the mornin I wanna freak sumn 
 I call babe when I wanna get sum 
 I gotta free pass when I wanna eat sum 
 She the first I call when I wanna beat sum 
 She catch 2, I catch 1, she catch me, I play dumb 
 I go deep, that's when she run 
 She rob me, with no gun 
 I held her with no ??????? 
 Last night though, we had big fun 
 When she mad she say "no son" 
 But when I'm mad, I say "yes mom" 
 You can take my cars, all my cash, my whole world 
 You can take my fame, all my jewels, just me and my girl 
 Just me and my girl 
 My girl (6x) 
 Just me and my girl 
 My girl (6x) 
 Last night guess what I showed her the stash this mornin, guess what, I moved the stash 
 Came home late, so I know she mad 
 Know how to fix all that, the gucci bag 
 Two five zero zero was on the tag, 
 And I bought her da belt, with a matchin' hat, 
 400,350 you do the math, took er mama dem shoppin' then covered da tab 
 Ain't let her homegirls go cause dem hoes some crabs 
 When I come home from work I took her a bath 
 Stuck my hand under the water and made her laugh 
 Dried off real good then made a child... 
 You can take my cars, all my cash, my whole world 
 You can take my fame, all my jewels, just me and my girl 
 Just me and my girl (6x) 
 Now I know this might sound crazy but all I need is my baby 'cause she holds me down, that's why I keep her round. 
 You can take away my money just don't take my baby from me 'cause she loves me down, that's why I keep her round 
 You can take my cars, all my cash, my whole world 
 You can take my fame, all my jewels, just me and my girl 
 Just me and my girl (6x)
