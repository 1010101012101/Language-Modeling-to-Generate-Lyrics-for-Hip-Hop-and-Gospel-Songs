Aye bruh 
 Imma mother fuckin' goon 
 So whatever chick I fuck with 
 She got to be a goonette 
 I'm her goon yeah 
 And she's my goonette 
 I'm her goon yeah 
 And she's my goonette 
 Goon 
 For her birthday I bought her a pink ski mask 
 When I piss her off she don't let me eat the pussy when she get mad 
 But real nigga I ain't gont lie I done fucked her on the rag 
 It was like she was spottin', she ain't bleed that bad 
 She don't like to drive the chevy, drank too much gas 
 Gave her sixty and told her fuck it go buy the jag 
 She say she know when I'm lyin' to her 'cause I talk fast 
 Cut her friends them loose, she said them hoes crap 
 She like me 
 She don't fuck with rappers, they lie too bad 
 Pussy fat, I told her it look like she wearin' a pad 
 She ain't a ten or a dime, she a ten and a half 
 A goonette is the baddest bitch you can ever have 
 She's my baby, yeah 
 And I love her to death 
 She's got good loving, yeah 
 And she keeps it on deck 
 She holds me down, yeah 
 While I chase these checks 
 I'm her goon, yeah 
 And she's my goonette 
 Goon 
 She play tough and she act hard, but she cry easy 
 Say if she catch me with another bitch, she gone leave me 
 You fuck em' good and you take care of em' 
 They don't want you cheatin' 
 I first met her she was green dawg, but now she seasoned 
 She like to drank what I drank, she don't like to drank really 
 She don't trust no bitches, she feel like they schemin' 
 She hood as ever, she can talk just like them white folks 
 I don't know if she can fight forreal, but she talk shit though 
 And every time she get drunk she like to straighten the hole 
 First time I fucked her, I acted like the rubber broke 
 She act like she couldn't take it, she make me fuck her slow 
 But now she grab my ass, and make me fuck her mo' 
 She's my baby, yeah 
 And I love her to death 
 She's got good loving, yeah 
 And she keeps it on deck 
 She holds me down, yeah 
 While I chase these checks 
 I'm her goon, yeah 
 And she's my goonette 
 Goon 
 I don't want no dingy bitch, give me a goonette 
 Can put her hair up in a pony tail and still be that 
 Can be the just woke up, and pussy still wet 
 And she can be dead ass broke, but she can still dress 
 And everybody can piss her off, but she won't stress 
 And just to make sure I'm good nigga she gone check 
 And every two or three months nigga she get in check 
 Her biggest fear when it come to me is another bitch 
 She had her choice, to be gettin' fucked and not necked 
 If I had my choice, we'd be gettin' fucked and then neck 
 And now she listen and observe so she talk less 
 The next bitch to be my lady is a goonette 
 She's my baby, yeah 
 And I love her to death 
 She's got good loving, yeah 
 And she keeps it on deck 
 She holds me down, yeah 
 While I chase these checks 
 I'm her goon, yeah 
 And she's my goonette 
 Goon
