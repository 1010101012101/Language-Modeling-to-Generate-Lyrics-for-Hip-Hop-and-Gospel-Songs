I'm on 'gnac, she on Goosey 
 All my niggas keep they toolie 
 I'm in Chevy, he in Dualie 
 Me and my niggas, we finna make a movie 
 Six Chevy's, back to back 
 I drink brown, they drink white 
 Paint wet, engine tight 
 This our city, we run lights 
 Hustle all day, stunt at night 
 Pistol on lap, who gon' jack 
 Pulled up, Da REAList, pourin' out da whips 
 Time to show, who got chips 
 My dawg trippin', left his clip 
 Liqour store, one mo' fifth 
 Hog in the trunk, beatin' in yo ear 
 Mids screamin', highs clear 
 Spunt a stack, on my gear 
 Fuck them niggas, our year 
 Motion picture, right here 
 Stop this bitch, let's make a movie right here 
 I'm on 'gnac, she on Goosey 
 All my niggas keep they toolie 
 I'm in Chevy, he in Dualie 
 Me and my niggas, we finna make a movie 
 Better grab a seat and some popcorn 
 'Cause me and my niggas finna put on 
 Some in the streets, all of 'em strong 
 Couple my niggas just came home 
 Ridin' candy, sittin' on chrome 
 Pants hangin', grill showin' 
 Wildin' hard, every set we on 
 Catch me standin' on the hood of my (throne?) 
 We don't play nothin' but my songs 
 Them niggas ain't real they just rap, homes 
 'Fore it's over, money gettin' thrown 
 Holdin' up traffic, are we wrong 
 I'm on 'gnac, she on Goosey 
 All my niggas keep they toolie 
 I'm in Chevy, he in Dualie 
 Me and my niggas, we finna make a movie 
 Over to the club, we shuttin' it down 
 Ain't no secret when I'm in town 
 Party's closed, says who, Plies 
 Here you go, couple thousand 
 In this corner, only goons allowed 
 All the goons, we makin' 'em proud 
 My dawg on pills, let him wild 
 Just give him a water and a towel 
 Right song, come on, bop through the crowd 
 Wanna crank up the club, put on Plies 
 Time to throw money, I ain't threw it in awhile 
 Slangin' money, let it pile 
 I'm on 'gnac, she on Goosey 
 All my niggas keep they toolie 
 I'm in Chevy, he in Dualie 
 Me and my niggas, we finna make a movie
