Featuring Trey Songz 
 Went to sleep real Woke up realer 
 Who the affiliated ex drug dealer 
 Resume silent Street cred bigger 
 Click full of soldiers All of us killers 
 Never seen one I'm what they call a real nigga 
 Pocket full of cash Body full of liquor 
 Put my whips on it Bet he ain't triller 
 If I don't know ya homie Hands on pistols 
 You lookin' at da man 
 Stacks and rubber bands (yep) 
 Action for the cameras 
 You can ask the fans cause 
 They say I'm da man 
 Watch me pull my pants up 
 Watch me do my dance (yep) 
 Stacks and rubber bands (yep) 
 You lookin' at da man 
 Whip on 22's 
 Floatin when I move 
 Askin what it do 
 You lookin' at da man 
 Watch me pull my pants up 
 Watch me do my dance (yep) 
 Stacks and rubber bands (yep) 
 Key to the city Name carry weight 
 I don't fuck with niggas Most of them fake 
 You behind the ears Jumped off the post lake 
 Where I'm from homie Home of the goons aid 
 Came up slow All off of shake 
 Grandma dyin' Hard to be straight 
 Just left court My dog lost his case 
 They gave him life homie All for them 28's 
 Product of the hood Came from the gutta 
 Been through it all Still remain a hustla 
 Ride or die homie Before I fuckin' struggle 
 Choppa game serious Got it from my brother 
 Learn the hard way Streets don't love ya 
 Snitchin at a high Dope game in trouble 
 Whip game shaky Yeah you gone suffa 
 I'm da man homie Can't deny it sucka
