Ay momma (ay momma) 
 I know ain't never tell you this before (I ain't never tell you this before) 
 But it really hurt me to know (hurt me) I'm runnig you crazy (I'm runnig you crazy) 
 I want to talk to you real quick (I want to talk to you momma) 
 My momma told me while I run these streets she can't sleep 
 Her phone ring late at night 
 She think somthing than happened to me 
 Her nerves so bad right now she can't watch TV 
 She turn her head every time time she see a police 
 Scared to look cause it might be me in the backseat 
 Whenever she hear about a shooting 
 Her heart skip a beat 
 She heard the feds in town 
 Her knee got weak 
 She know I'm at the house 
 The only time she at peace 
 Her blood pressure through the roof all because of me 
 Her favorite words is dope ain't the only way to eat 
 She told me the other day 
 She hope I don't die in these streets 
 I just pray to god 
 She don't wipe her hands with me 
 Ima goon to these streets 
 But to my momma I'm still a baby 
 Raise a street nigga by yourself 
 You a hell of a lady 
 Shit I'm doing now 
 Got nothing to do 
 With how you raised me 
 Sh** killing 
 Me to know I'm running my momma crazy 
 Remember the night me sitting up in a cold cell 
 Waking you up out yo sleep it's me calling you from jail (collect call) 
 You ain't tell me 
 But I know inside you mad as hell 
 You called off of work just to bond me out of jail 
 I get in trouble I call you 
 Seem like it never fail 
 Can hear you now 
 Boy you need to sit your ass down somewhere 
 I come and eat I take a shower and I'm out of there 
 I know I'm stressin you at times seems like I don't care 
 You wrote bad checks for me to have something to wear 
 Everytime I think about this sh** 
 You reached for freedom for me 
 Nine days thatz real rare 
 Every time I think about this sh** I wanna shed a tear 
 Thatz why I buy you something 
 For fathers day every year 
 Ima goon to these streets 
 But to my momma I'm still a baby 
 Raise a street nigga by yourself 
 You a hell of a lady 
 Sh** I'm doing now 
 Got nothing to do 
 With how you raised me 
 Sh** killing me 
 To know I'm running my momma crazy 
 You did the best you could with me 
 And I love you for that 
 Wanted me to stay in school 
 But that ain't where my heart was at 
 I got exsposed to the streets 
 And fell in love with stacks 
 And all the times I hurt you 
 Wish I could take it back 
 When daddy left us you stepped up and took up his slack 
 I know I'm selfish and feelings is something I know I lack 
 The sh** I'm doing now I know you raised me better than that 
 You tought me how to be a man 
 And showed me how to act 
 Sometimes I wonder how you still proud I'm your son 
 After all the stuff I took you through 
 And all the shit I done 
 But like you told me when god want me how I can't run 
 Before he take me want you to know I love you momma 
 Ima goon to these streets 
 But to my momma I'm still a baby 
 Raise a street nigga by yourself 
 You a hell of a lady 
 Sh** I'm doing now 
 Got nothing to do 
 With how you raised me 
 Sh** killing me 
 To know I'm running my momma crazy 
 I think I'm speakin' 
 For every street nigga 
 Around the world 
 I don't think we sit down long enough 
 Sometimesjust to realize 
 What we takin' our momma through 
 It hurt me to know dog 
 That I'm runnin' my momma crazy 
 It really killin' me to know that I'm help killing my momma
