Car full of choppers and everbody quiet, a car full of goons and everybody cerified, and if you froze up last time you can't ride it's going down tonight (why) 'cause these goons out lurkin (2x) 
 5:00 in the morning ain't nobody out but us 
 And everybody sleep but we finna wake the city up 
 And finna teach you pussy niggas bout playin' with us 
 We find yo duck ass tonight lil' homey you out of luck 
 And he don't know we coming finna get his life took 
 We ridin' bin ladin shit a hundred round plus 
 Before he went to sleep he ain't know he wouldn't be waking up 
 It's already understood if these crackers get behind tha flush and we ain't coming home till all the clips empty 
 And we ain't shooting up no house it draw too much attention 
 We catch yo ass coming out lil homey you gets it 
 And I bet one muthafuckin' thing nigga we ain't missing 
 Car full of choppers and everbody quiet, a car full of goons and everybody cerified, and if you froze up last time you can't ride it's going down tonight (why) 'cause these goons out lurkin (2x) 
 You might miss the newspaper but you gon' make the news 
 Victim found face down knocked 'im out his shoes 
 Dem choppers went off he tried ta run but couldn't move 
 Sawed him in half that chopper broke him down in 2 
 Everything them hallow points hit knock 'em loose 
 We want your homeboys nah pussy we ain't through 
 Dem crackers find a hundred holes but they ain't got a clue 
 Now everbody claim they know who fucked over you 
 A big mouth don't get you shit but a big funeral 
 And a bunch of muthafuckers crying who claiming they knew ya 
 You can't bring him back stop crying the pussy dead 
 He shoul've kept his mouth close he ain't know how to play it 
 Car full of choppers and everbody quiet, a car full of goons and everybody cerified, and if you froze up last time you can't ride it's going down tonight (why) 'cause these goons out lurkin (2x)
