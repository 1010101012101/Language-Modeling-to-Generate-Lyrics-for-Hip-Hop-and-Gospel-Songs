 Ooh 
 She My Bust It Baby [x6] 
 Plies: 
 First time we had sex, it was like a movie 
 Both of us fell asleep, woke up woozy 
 Love how she say my name, love how she do me 
 Gain feelings for her, kinda quick, kinda blew me 
 Found myself thinking 'bout her shit kinda spooked me 
 Mo' time we spent together the mo' she got attached 
 I love being around her, seem like the perfect match 
 She ain't blow my phone up and she ain't neva hack 
 She knew her place, played her role, and she was cool with that 
 What you doing?, Where you going?, Questions she don't ask 
 She took my mind off the streets, she helped me relax 
 She wanna VIP her baby, she put me on my back 
 (Refrain x2: Plies and Trey Songz) 
 Her sex game crazy 
 Body So Amazing 
 Kiss like she cravin' 
 Walk like she taken 
 Attitude mistaken 
 Fiend for her daily 
 Care about her greatly 
 Why she my bust it baby 
 Plies: 
 What we did last night got me wantin' to call her 
 If I wasn't real homie I'd probably stalk her 
 From the hood, when she get drunk she talk proper 
 Got kinky with her, told her to dress up like a lawyer 
 I was the judge last night I gave her all the orders 
 Worked it real good, turned her round doggy spawled her 
 Told her if I gave her anymore I'm a have to charge her 
 Felt the vibe in the room, the feelings getting larger 
 Took her from the bench now turned her into a starter 
 Taste like suga, smell like water 
 Now she into goons, all off what I taught her 
 What I do to her make her care about me harder
