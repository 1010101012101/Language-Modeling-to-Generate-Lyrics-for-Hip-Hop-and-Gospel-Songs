I keep a couple killas 'round me when I move 
 'Cause Ion't really fuck wit' a lot of these dudes 
 You won't rob me but I might rob you 
 So, when you see me, you gon' see my goons 
 Couple killas on my right, couple killas on my left 
 But I am a muthafuckin' killa myself 
 Got my Glock 40 right up under my belt 
 Hit you wit' this burner and you will melt 
 I only hang wit' my goons and nobody else 
 So, you better keep your hands to yourself 
 When I say I'm ready, then we gon' step 
 You ain't got enough guns, you gon' need some help 
 Make sure this what you want 'cause we will shoot you to death 
 'Cause we a lil' silly, we is bad fo' yo health 
 All of us stay wit' it, all of us stay strapped 
 That's why I keep all my goons on deck 
 I keep a couple killas 'round me when I move 
 'Cause Ion't really fuck wit' a lot of these dudes 
 You won't rob me but I might rob you 
 So, when you see me, you gon' see my goons 
 Smell the liqour on my breath, smell the dro on my skin 
 Look, they throwin' big faces in the wind 
 I am not friendly and I'm not your friend 
 Gave the bouncer 200, he slipped my fire in 
 Whenever y'all ready, let the shootin' games begin 
 I'm walkin' kinda slow 'cause my fire big 
 Either y'all betta chill or we gon mess up y'all gig 
 We all lookin' crazy 'cause all of us bent 
 My goons paranoid, so please don't flinch 
 'Cause all my goons ain't got good sense 
 We all dead-drunk and all of us lit 
 But I love my goons 'cause they tote they shit 
 I keep a couple killas 'round me when I move 
 'Cause Ion't really fuck wit' a lot of these dudes 
 You won't rob me but I might rob you 
 So, when you see me, you gon' see my goons 
 I am come solo tonight, I'm wit' my clique 
 I haven't seen her since I fucked that bitch 
 And I haven't called her so I know she sick 
 Pushed her off on the goons let one of them hit 
 'Cause I gotta stay focused 'cause these niggas real slick 
 You will not rob me, turn around and sell my shit 
 Keep my eyes open 'cause it happen real quick 
 How many of us wit' fire, umm, 'bout 6 
 I keep a couple killas 'round me when I move 
 'Cause Ion't really fuck wit' a lot of these dudes 
 You won't rob me but I might rob you 
 So, when you see me, you gon' see my goons
