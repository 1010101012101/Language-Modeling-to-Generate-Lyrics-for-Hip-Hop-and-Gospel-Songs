 Niggas don't want to see me with shit the white man don't neither 
 That's why I ride everyday drank my liquor and smoke my reefer 
 The mexicans the only mother fuckers they put beneath us 
 I guess if you poor and white the world don't fuck with you neither 
 I get it I understand I'm black so ain't equal 
 When you from the hood though that shit run a lil deeper 
 And one mother fucker in my hood that done never became a doctor 
 And one body in my family who done never became a lawyer 
 My daddy sold dope that shit hard not to follow 
 My momma did her best but she had her own problems 
 My brother two times loose that's a whole bother saga 
 Every nigga in my click at some point was a robber 
 It's hard to think different cause shit I'm from the projects 
 Soon as you make a lil money got to spend it fight charges 
 Ain't pussy I'ma hundred so I can't live with cautions 
 I'm just trying to make show my wins out weigh my loses

 It's a thousand niggas that die for every one nigga that make it out 
 My homie can't even read but do his thang with the pots 
 His momma been dead his daddy smoking rocks 
 He can't get a job some might say it's his own fault 
 Sometime situations can change what you was taught 
 My momma and daddy wasn't together I wonder where I'd be 
 Cause most the shit I know now I learned it from the streets 
 Cause being a certain color it attracts the police 
 And when you live in certain areas you can never get peace 
 My momma biggest fear me dying in these streets 
 But if ain't up in it how the fuck I'm go eat 
 And it's sad to say but nobody in my family got a degree 
 A nigga playing ball and dropped out for the streets 
 And got involved in hustling and got in too deep 
 The shit got over my head and the nigga couldn't even see 
 The streets ain't the honest but I'ma be all I can be 
 They say one out of ten blacks we go die behind bars 
 Say we was born in the ghetto then we ain't go make it far

 I just got one wish for drop me in a casket 
 To wake up one morning and see my momma happy 
 I wanna salute God for all the bad shit that happened 
 Cause everything that went wrong now I understand it 
 He protect me from my enemies protect me when I was trapping 
 He left when I was lil but I still forget my daddy 
 The world done got rough everything done got drastic 
 I'm just a black man that's the color of my family 
 If I'm ever go make it the hustle I got to marry 
 The road done been rough but I refuse to let it try me 
 I done made some mistakes but shit ain't embarrassed 
 I got to beat the odds cause one day I'ma parish
