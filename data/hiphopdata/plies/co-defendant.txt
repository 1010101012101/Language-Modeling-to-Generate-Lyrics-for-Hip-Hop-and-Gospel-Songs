Bruh 
 I do NOT fuck wit alotta niggas, bruh 
 They see me, they gon' see me solo bruh 
 These pussy ass niggas out here too creep for me, bruh 
 These niggas is not gon' state me, bruh 
 Y'all call them niggas y'all homeboys 
 Cracker call y'all organization 
 (x2) 
 Stay in my own lane 
 Mind my own bidness 
 Hit my own licks 
 Get my own pennies 
 Keep these niggas from round me, 'cause I ain't friendly 
 You'll never slide up under me and be my co-defendant 
 Time to do bidness 
 Drop niggas off 
 Never run to them crackers on me bout what ya saw 
 Never snake me, and get me knocked off 
 Niggas like hos, love to run they fuckin' mouth 
 Speak to them in the streets, won't bring them to my house 
 I don't trust neither bitch, north or the south 
 Won't be around me tryna scope it out 
 That SUPAfriendly shit, ain't about 
 Iono him, keep him from round me 
 Tryna peep somethin'? 
 What you tryna see? 
 Never get that close to find out where I be 
 I don't know that nigga 
 Get him from 'round me... 
 (x2) 
 Stay in my own lane 
 Mind my own bidness 
 Hit my own licks 
 Get my own pennies 
 Keep these niggas from round me, 'cause I ain't friendly 
 You'll never slide up under me and be my co-defendant 
 Niggas come around, guess what? I stop talkin' 
 Holla at chu niggas later, grab my shit and start walkin' 
 Fuck that shit, I done seen too much 
 It seem niggas scope niggas and gettin' niggas touched 
 Get in friends wit niggas, turn 'round and set 'em up 
 Even my own dawg, talk to 'em bout certain stuff 
 My own friends come around, nigga I hush 
 Outside of court rooms, nigga I done seen enough 
 Time to get money, I'm so loyal 
 4 deep doin' business, that's a no-no 
 'Cause what a nigga thinkin', you will never know 
 But do my own time nigga, if I have to go 
 (x2) 
 Stay in my own lane 
 Mind my own bidness 
 Hit my own licks 
 Get my own pennies 
 Keep these niggas from round me, 'cause I ain't friendly 
 You'll never slide up under me and be my co-defendant 
 Ion fuck wit no nigga, who got alotta friends 
 Cause you never know, who that nigga want to win 
 You vibe wit too many niggas, you spread yaself then 
 And them the type of niggas, know everybody business then 
 Nigga too friendly, no tellin' who he wit 
 You niggas fuck wit any nigga, you can't do it big 
 Guarenteed you will neva slide up under kid 
 I keep my eyes open, and my fire hid 
 That's how I stay away, from all the fuck shit 
 I gotta couple homeboys, but I don't run wit clique 
 The least a nigga know, the less he can snitch 
 I run solo, so I don't have to kill a bitch 
 (x2) 
 Stay in my own lane 
 Mind my own bidness 
 Hit my own licks 
 Get my own pennies 
 Keep these niggas from round me, 'cause I ain't friendly 
 You'll never slide up under me and be my co-defendant
