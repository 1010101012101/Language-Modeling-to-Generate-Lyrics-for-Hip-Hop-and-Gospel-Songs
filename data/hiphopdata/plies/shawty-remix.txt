 From the first time we made love, I knew you was my shawty 
 And when I did that bid, you always had my back, cause you are my shawty 
 That's why I don't mind caking up with you, cause you are my shawty 
 And girl I love all the freaky things we do, shawty 
 Vese 1- Plies 
 I don't call her shawty no more, I call her my bust it baby 
 Hope she ever let me fuck, I was gone run her crazy 
 Gave her some of this sweet meat, now I got her crazy 
 Felt sorry for my baby, how I left her shakin' 
 Told her don't move, let me wipe you off baby 
 Kiss her in the mouth, told her how I love she take it 
 Put her head on my chest and fell asleep naked 
 She was shy when I met her, now she participatin' 
 Keep the lights on, so I can see she amazing 
 Sexy as hell, I love to watch her while she bathin' 
 Come and wake me up to help her when she shaving 
 She my bust it baby, she smiles when I say it 
 Chorus-Trey Songz

 And when I did that bid, you always had my back, you are my shawty 
 That's why I don't mind kickin' up with you, 'cause you are my shawty

 Verse 2-Plies 
 You know she bad, 'cause she walk with her nose in the air 
 She findin' everything, don't even matter what she wear 
 To get her started, I just run my fingers through her hair 
 You know its mine, 'cause she let me give it to her bare 
 I broke bread with her, just to show her a goon care 
 What I love about her? she turn me on anywhere 
 You know she bad, she fuckin', you can't help but stare 
 I know I had her when she told me, baby I don't share 
 I told her me neither, I don't put my tongue everywhere 
 She ask me, was it good to me, I told her hell yeah 
 I had to teach her a lil' bit, I took her from a square 
 I put my stamp on it, it's all mine, I made it clear
