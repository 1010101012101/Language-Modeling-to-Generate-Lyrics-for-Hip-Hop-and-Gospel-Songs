I went to see my nigga, he doin' seventeen 
 One of the realist niggas, I done ever seen 
 Got caught wit' a bird, but his record was clean 
 Comin' back from Dade, on da Gator wit' speed 
 He a real soldier, but his partner was greed 
 Get out when he forty, went in at twenty-three 
 How seventeen years worth one key 
 Some shit cost twenty-grand can get you over ten piece 
 He ain't wanna hurt nobody, he was just tryna eat 
 He had a real job, went to work four days a week 
 Said this his last trip, and he was gettin' out the streets 
 He a good nigga, second chance all he need 
 Some niggas make mistakes, off fucked up circumstance 
 Now they life gone, probably gon' die in the pen 
 They done gave up on life and put it in God's hands 
 I thought this was America, what happened to a second chance 
 Wish I had one chance, to sentence the Judge kids 
 And watch 'em beg for they life like my niggas did 
 Give them a life sentence fo' some shit that wasn't big 
 'Fore they get granted they appeal they gotta do ten 
 Shoe gotta be on the otha foot for you to understand 
 The scariest shit in the world to be a black man 
 What my future holds, wish I knew in advance 
 I approach life everyday just hopin' I win 
 A lot us already lost, we sittin' in the pen 
 This shit crazy 'cause God, he forgive sin 
 But when it come to the system that shit don't bend 
 I guess it do, dependin' on the color of yo' skin 
 Some niggas make mistakes, off fucked up circumstance 
 Now they life gone, probably gon' die in the pen 
 They done gave up on life and put it in God's hands 
 I thought this was America, what happened to a second chance 
 I thought it was understood, nobody was perfect 
 So, how can one mistake make yo' life worthless 
 God made us all, put us here to serve a purpose 
 Yo life in twelve strangers hands to come back with a verdict 
 But is that really fair, what if they all was dirty 
 You mess up one time, and they come back with thirty 
 But if you ain't got money, yo whole family hurtin' 
 Then you ain't got a choice, you gotta cop out early 
 But if you was rich, you wouldn'ta got them thirty 
 What if the Judge racist, nobody'd overturn it 
 The system fucked up, because it ain't sturdy 
 Welcome to America, home of the controversy 
 Some niggas make mistakes, off fucked up circumstance 
 Now they life gone, probably gon' die in the pen 
 They done gave up on life and put it in God's hands 
 I thought this was America, what happened to a second chance
