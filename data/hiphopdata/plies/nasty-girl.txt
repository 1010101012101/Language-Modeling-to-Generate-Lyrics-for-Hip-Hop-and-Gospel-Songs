She makes her own money, pays her own bills, always stat fly, keeps it so real, 
 But behind closed doors she a nasty girl behind closed doors she a nasty girl. 
 She got a crazy little figure, nice round ass, walks so proper, talks with such class, 
 But behind closed doors she a nasty girl, behind closed doors she a nasty girl. 
 I met this girl named Keysha, she was so sweet 
 Nails stay manicured, pretty little feet 
 Shoes so sexy, body so hot 
 Hair lookin' like she just came from the shop 
 Legs so smooth, clothes so tight 
 Style so sexy, make her just right 
 Never too much, never too little 
 Black laced bra, Vicki secrets in the middle 
 Eyes so innocent, smile so bright 
 Works in the mornin, but she'll party all night 
 All for a man, all 'cause she bought it 
 All 'cause she crazy in love and don't doubt it 
 Product of her birth place, know about the streets 
 Clean in the work place, dirty in the sheets 
 Keeps her own toaster, makes her own bread 
 Lady in the streets, but a freak in the bed 
 I got a college girl go to church every Sunday 
 Had to sneak her outta choir for her to put it on me 
 But she so innocent, when she when she around her mommy 
 One thing about her she get her own money 
 Gave it to her yesterday while she was doin' laundry 
 Favorite toy of mine is my lil bunny 
 Bow legged and glasses, such a real woman 
 Sex all night, go to work every mornin' 
 Text me from work and told me she was horny 
 Text her back and told her me too mommy 
 When you get off work daddy gon' punish 
 You're my nasty girl forever I promise 
 I got a doctor girlfriend that tells me come home soon 
 She plays like my house is her emergency room 
 Tells me to undress and to lay on the sofa 
 Checks all my vitals like a docs supposed ta 
 All white coat, all white heels 
 And nothin' underneath so it's an all night deal 
 I'm a number one patient and delighted to be 
 And when she needs her medicine I give her Vitamin D 
 But wait, I got a lawyer girl that's so wild 
 And every single night she wanna take me to trial 
 She said she needs some evidence and to show her the proof 
 So I put her on the stand and I give her the truth 
 'Cause I'm hung like a jury 
 Judge Luda preside over your body and I'm never in a hurry 
 You may proceed, let the games begin 
 And if I call a miss trial we gotta do it again
