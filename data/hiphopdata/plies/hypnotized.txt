Hey what's happinin' homie? 
 It's your lil' one plies man 
 I ran across the eyes of a lil' baby the other day homie 
 Lil' mama so bad she had me hypnotized 
 I couldn't get my eyes off her 
 Let me tell you how it's like to be hypnotized 
 Akon 
 You got me so hypnotized 
 The way your body rollin' round and round 
 That booty keep bumpin' titty's just bouncin' up and down 
 You got me so hypnotized 
 The way your body rollin' round and round 
 That booty keep bumpin' titty's just bouncin' up and down 
 It's 2:00 in the mornin' 
 I'm yiked up & I'm horny 
 All I need now is some moanin' 
 That pussy got me zoanin' 
 Her vibe tell me she want it 
 She gotta fuck how she on me 
 I got her tonight 'cause she joanin' 
 I know in the panty she foamin' 
 I'm locked eyes on that monkey 
 I know she wet, 'cause she told me 
 That ass on the she pokin' 
 Every nigga in here scopin' 
 I see me up in her pokin' 
 She bent over & I'm strokin' 
 Her cheeks spread wide opened 
 I'm beatin' it & I'm focused 
 Akon 
 You got me so hypnotized 
 The way your body rollin' round and round 
 That booty keep bumpin' titty's just bouncin' up and down 
 You got me so hypnotized 
 The way your body rollin' round and round 
 That booty keep bumpin' titty's just bouncin' up and down 
 Akon 
 Now do it some more (just like that) 
 Just do it some more (yes just like that) 
 Girl do it some more (now shake that ass, make a nigga like me spend that cash) 
 Now do it some more (just like that) 
 Just do it some more (yes just like that) 
 Girl do it some more (now shake that ass, make a nigga like me spend that cash) 
 She bad as hell and she swoll 
 I'm tryin' to play in her hole 
 Lil' mama a dime, she cold 
 I fuck her once and she sold 
 I want her naked no clothes 
 I'm into private shows 
 No limit anything goes 
 I'm a let her ride me her toes 
 Just stand in front of me and pose 
 You touch mine, I touch yours 
 To get her sprung is my goal 
 First time I seen her I froze 
 I had to get her she knows 
 She buck'd it then she fold 
 'Cause I'm too real and she knows 
 She wanna goon and it show
