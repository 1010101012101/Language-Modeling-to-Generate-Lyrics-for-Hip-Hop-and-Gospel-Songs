(Feat. j. holiday) 
 [Plies:] it's plies baby 
 My baby just called me and told me to come put her to sleep she said her period just 
 Went off and she feel like she in heat I been feenin for her I couldn't touch her all 
 Week I told to get naked and be watin on top of the sheets I wanted so bad when 
 I seen I ain't had time to speak I told her on my sholders is wear I want to see her 
 Feet I put a pillow behind her head board so it wouldn't squeak and put her hands around 
 My waist and told her to push me deep. I told her ima work her tonight until she on e 
 I can feel her nails in my back that's how I know I'm beatin' I put my ear to her mouth i 
 Love to hear her breath can tell she almost at her peek by the way she screamin feel 
 Her wetnees on her stomach and I'm the reason she clutchin the sheets and runnin' I'm tryin' 
 To keep her even whispered in her ear you don't nut I ain't leavin' she went from moanin, 
 To shakin and now she sleepin'
