She's a different she's a different she's a different kind of lady 
 [Benzino]: 
 Yo I'd like to introduce to you two very special women in my life. 
 Let me tell you bout this girl I know I met her in four corners in Boston some 
 Years ago since we first made contact I knew it was right yeah and the girl 
 Been in my life ever since that night her body was tight I'm tellin' you dawg I 
 Had to get her remember like it's yesterday the day that I met her she was 
 Rollin' with Jamaicans but on the really she told me she was raised in the 
 Hearts of Philly city of brotherly love was from the hood used to run the back 
 Woods with thugs who sold drugs her friends they used to flirt I considered 
 Them garbage while she was bein chased by every nigga in college used to date 
 Some clown from up north he used to choke her but I would never treat her like 
 That 'cause she's a smoker one of a kind honey's a dime with no seeds I ain't 
 Gon never let her go 'cause she's all I need indeed 
 Chorus: (She's a different kind of lady...) 
 She's a a dif-different kind of lady and she will never hurt you she'll never 
 Desert you she'll be the one to hold ya down repeat 
 [Benzino]: 
 Man there's just somethin' about her (love) that I swear sometimes I can't make 
 It through a whole day without her some say our relationship is not that strong 
 They said it's just a phase won't last that long Jeff said I was wrong to fall 
 In love 'cause she was passed around I don't care she with me right now I'm so 
 Attracted to her vibe she got me open so wide and you can tell by the glow in 
 My eyes it's hard to sleep without her by my bed at night with her on my side 
 I'm gon be all right I love to hold her squeeze her don't let go she's my heat in 
 The winter when the weather is cold see anytime there's drama she gon come in a 
 Hurry not jealous if she see me with my main girl Mary she gon go to war with 
 Me hit the floor with me if I go on a caper she gon keep in the door with me I 
 Was smokin' quick to put a nigga on blast only person that I tell where I hide 
 The cash she's a gangsta bitch she don't give a fuck drive-bys stick her head 
 Out the window push puff blow smoke out her nose it's a must a propose 'cause I 
 Love her don't give a fuck who knows she's the Bonnie to my Clyde the Tina to 
 My Ike her name is Nina I love her for the rest of my life
