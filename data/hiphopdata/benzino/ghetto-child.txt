Yo, this is 
 B 
 Brown [Intro: 
 Bobby 
 Brown] 
 We gon lay ya back on this 
 Benzino track, right 
 Two times [Chorus 2x: 
 Female] (Bobby 
 Brown) 
 Eye for an eye (Ghetto, ghetto) 
 Strong will survive (Yeah, yeah) 
 Look deep inside (My ghetto child) 
 Everyday struggle to stay alive 
 Ghetto child gon learn to fly (Ghetto child) 
 Bet cha wanna ride [Bobby 
 Brown] 
 Now being born in the ghetto, it's hard, believe me 
 Not just a job, anything ain't easy 
 You go through rough times, you go through hard times 
 But what I got is a man's best friend 
 And times even tougher than that I know I'll fail staying in a house that your bed shield 
 Only bulletproof is if you don't need outside 
 Brothers'll stick you up and in it they'll take pride 
 'Cause if not, you get popped, ya be another victim of homicide 
 It's a living hell, you got to be the guy 
 You got to be live-full 
 Peer pressure pounds and if you ain't stressful 
 Black to feed the back 
 Your not see-through, your not even equal 
 Never second guess a professor [Chorus 2x] 
 But that's the price you pay being born in the ghetto [*in the ghetto* echoes] [Mr. 
 Gzus] 
 Let me explain to you, un-hunh, some game is the truth 
 Mainly I speak to the youth I used to hustle drugs with a crew I was young and green and hungry, what's a nigga to do? 
 We used to smoke weed on the roof and let the ions loose 
 Lost to the streets 
 While shorty saw us off the ninety proof 
 Loved to rhyme so throw me a beat and flow would make the joint complete 
 At the same time I gots ta eat 
 Took a stands, stole a seat jumped in the game to compete 
 Unaware of the heat, there's was def from cheek to cheek 
 No sleep for two weeks stated all kinds of beef 
 Been through hell and back before I was grown 
 No pops to teach me to how spread my wings and fly, I did that on my own 
 Made it this far and I'ma keep goin' 
 Y'all ain't knowin', I'm still here and keep growin', from a ghetto child [Chorus 2x] [Bobby 
 Brown] 
 Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto 
 It ain't nothing about hits 
 It's about these grits 
 Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto 
 Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto 
 Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto 
 Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto 
 Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto 
 Born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto 
 Being born in the... 
 Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto 
 Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto 
 Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto 
 Being born in the ghetto 
 Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto 
 Don't make it up, don't make it up 
 Being born in the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto [Chorus 2x]
