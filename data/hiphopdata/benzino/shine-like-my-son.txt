Yo, Benzino. 
 My lil 7 year old son uh huh. 
 Ray-shaun. this ones for you. 
 Whenever your travels get lonely 
 Your troubled you feel all alone 
 Remember this juice I shared with you 
 And let your life shine like the sun. 
 Be strong my son 
 (Benzino) I watched you crawl before you walk 
 From day one. 
 (Lil ray ray) You da greatest dad 
 (Benzino) and you's the greatest son 
 The day will come 
 When you'll have kids and raise them. 
 (Lil ray ray) come on slow down dad. 
 I'm tryna stay young. 
 (Benzino) iight. I'mma teach you 
 How to play and win. 
 Follow your first thoughts 
 And never think again. 
 I'm your main man 
 From the womb 
 And you're a jewel 
 Now I don't want you see the things 
 I been through 
 You got haterz in life 
 That try-n-play you 
 Never get emotional 
 Think, remain cool. 
 Follow rules. 
 You'll have it all. 
 The plain truth. 
 Last But not least, 
 Don't let Money Change you. 
 Whenever your travels get lonely 
 (And if ya don't know! now ya know!) 
 Your troubled and feel all alone. 
 Remember this juice I shared with you 
 And let your life shine like the son. 
 (Lil ray ray) Be so strong. 
 (Benzino) I'mma give you answers 
 To your questions. 
 Like why its important, 
 When havin' sex to use protection. 
 You a blessing, 
 And I always got you. 
 Not just opposite, 
 I'm your role model. 
 There's more to life than money; 
 Morals, values. 
 There's rules in life 
 It's important you follow 
 Like, never fondle touch what ain't yours 
 Unless you got to, 
 And help mom with the chores 
 Be responsible, 
 Never follow, but lead. 
 Just watch the things your father do 
 When they see you, they see me 
 Can you spit like your dad? 
 (Lil ray ray) 
 Yeah its easy! 
 A-B-C 1-2-3 
 Set off a jeep 
 From the beep 
 Turn the beat up 
 Turn the heat up 
 Microphones like food I eat em 
 After dinner I'm a winna 
 Y'all can't stop me 
 Y'all beginners 
 (Benzino) sometimes moms get mad 
 It ain't funny don't laugh. 
 When you're right ok 
 When your wrong that's your ass 
 Not 'cause I want to son understand 
 Moms can teach you everything, 
 But how to be a man 
 You's a champ, 
 I'm The Champion 
 (Lil ray ray) I'mma prince, 
 (Benzino) But I'm the king of the throan. 
 (Lil ray ray) Let it be known 
 We gonna shine 
 Check this watch man you know the time 
 Time to get mine 
 Oh you didn't know 
 Sit back, and check the father-son flow. 
 (Benzino) come on ray ray tell em 
 (Lil ray ray) And If ya Don't Know 
 Now ya know 
 Be strong my son!

 Be so strong, be so strong 
 Be like one 
 Get this family thing back on... 
 Back on track 
 Be strong my son 
 (Chorus to fade)
