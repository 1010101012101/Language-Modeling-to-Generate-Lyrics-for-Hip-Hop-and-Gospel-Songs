Pink] 
 Every time you come around you lit me up, 
 Every time you come to town you pick me up, 
 Even though you're not around you know you want me (you know) 
 All I want to do is kick it from tonight 
 All I ask is that you stay just one more night 
 All I want is to here you say you want me 
 See ain't nobody liver [Benzino] 
 Like 
 DC3 I'm a survivor I stay candid 
 Four seat branded 
 Front standard 
 Dirt bandit with two cannons (bleow!) 
 Here's what the plans is 
 In the studio paid off stanzas 
 A good life for me and my man's 
 So in the long run 
 All heat and nothing sweet 
 Every song done gotta be bananas 
 From city streets to corporate suits 
 From these gritty beats 
 Get a good look, I'm here to stay 
 Benzino gonna show you how the big dogs play [Hook: 
 Pink] 
 Every time you come to town you pick me up, 
 Every time you come around you lit me up, 
 Even though you're not around you know you want me (you know) 
 All I want to do is kick it from tonight 
 All I want is to here you say you want me 
 All I ask is that you stay just one more night [Benzino] 
 Black ice on the neck and wrist (that's 
 Benzino) 
 Most hated at the top of the list (that's 
 Benzino) 
 Hangman with the gangsta hits (that's 
 Benzino) 
 Top dog that you never forget (that's 
 Benzino) I want the platinum plaque, y'all can have the game back 
 Watch me turn up the thermostat I burn it black 
 Price of fame 
 More friends more foes new 
 Benz new clothes no sleep no doe 
 Hate to see me doin' it, love the chance to ruin it 
 Ferrari in the hood, you know who in it 
 Thug nigga, 
 Benzino mob figga 
 Always in the paint part saint part sinner 
 Put some 
 E in the liquor then its easy to hit her 
 Straight out the gate full plate bread winner 
 The one with the six and still poppin' the clip I'm young, black and rich and I'm talkin' shit [Hook: 
 Pink] 
 Every time you come to town you pick me up, 
 Every time you come around you lit me up, 
 Even though you're not around you know you want me (you know) 
 All I want to do is kick it from tonight 
 All I want is to here you say you want me 
 All I ask is that you stay just one more night [Benzino] I switched up the game but I'm still the same 
 How fame got the whole world callin my name (Benzino!) 
 Glad I came I keep the flame 
 Call it how I see it 
 The streets to blame 
 Tryin' do me 
 Live stress free 
 Stay away from bullshit, y'all know me 
 Still pull shit and let go of freaks 
 Toss you in a thug pit 
 Real hip-hop, hard as concrete 
 Real thug shit I see lots of money and pounds of treats 
 Now check it, I rip mics and sell records 
 Sign autographs, respect to accept it [Hook: 
 Pink (Benzino)] 
 Every time you come to town you pick me up, (yeah, 
 Ray 
 Benzino) 
 Every time you come around you lit me up, (un-hunh, 
 Pink, c'mon) 
 All I want to do is kick it from tonight 
 Even though you're not around you know you want me (you know) 
 All I ask is that you stay just one more night (what) 
 All I want is to here you say you want me [Hook fades out]
