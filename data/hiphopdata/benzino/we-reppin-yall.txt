 Light that blunt, burn that hash, keep it movin yo (Made

 Thou] 
 Your days are numbered nigga (what?) you better bounce 
 Got thirty-two rounds in my twenty ounce 
 Squeeze slugs till the gun jam, any mission I'm on 
 Blue nickel, new pistol performs in the physical form 
 Black leather doo-rag, two 
 Mags with speed loaders I'm a weed smoker, my cylinder spins, chillin' ya mens I'll shoot the shit out of you -- and ya man too 
 Loudmouth niggas catch it the worst, for example 
 Leave ya bodies in the gutter, cut up for the streetsweeper 
 Hack you the fuck up with a meat cleaver, retreat nigga 
 Take a seat dog, while we bang to this beat dog 
 Or pose, I'll pump holes in ya meat dog [Chorus] 
 To city kids and pretty bricks, saditty chicks 
 Hood rats and them killa cats, we reppin y'all 
 For niggas that's locked for 'ricks 
 GD's on blocks that got nine's to spit, we reppin y'all 
 These streets that be keepin' it real, throwin' money in ya grill 
 Strapped with the steel, we reppin y'all 
 To niggas that's gettin' mil's, playin' ball 
 All my ladies and all my dogs, we reppin y'all [Mr. 
 Gzus] I'ma keep it crackin' like the 
 Earth from it's axis 
 Non-stop spittin' hot shit with no practice 
 With this iron, I'm a blacksmith 
 With shit to make ya backflip 
 From the clap you do the twist and then you don't exist 
 Just for being a hostle, thug imposter 
 Hollow's, 
 Made 
 Men what? 
 The gunfire follow 
 On sight, fuckin' pop ya (Pow!) 
 Drop ya 
 My sharp shooters mentally ill, in 
 Bentley's we chill 
 Hit a nigga proper with these shells made of copper 
 Got cash and bought everything we ain't steal 
 And many clips to fill 'cause these streets stay real 
 We bring the heat, now you know how gettin' burned feel 
 Yo get peeled [Benzino] 
 We stack right? 
 Just make sure you don't get caught sleepin', whistle deaf right? 
 Benzino catch you while yo creepin', try yo' best right? 
 You not believin what you seein, infrared right? 
 These niggas wanna go to war, it's time to ride right? 
 You niggas dead right? 
 Slippin in clips right? 
 They gonna make me run up in the crib and flip right? 
 But when it's time to get it on they run and hide right? 
 My niggas rip right? 
 See I'm on top now 
 And if you wanna fuck around then you'll get shot now 
 Don't let me send my 
 Boston niggas to your block now 
 Then make 'em strip you to your knees and take your glock now [Chorus] 
 We got it locked now... (Nigga) [Repeat to fade]
