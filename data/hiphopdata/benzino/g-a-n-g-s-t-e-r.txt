G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R [Benzino] 
 Uh... Hangmen 3 (Gangsta jugga) 
 Uh huh (Gangsta jugga) 
 Uh huh yo (Gangsta jugga) 
 Pray on it sober, I'm just another step closer 
 Niggas'll ghost ya, found out these'll hurt ya I'm moralized street solider, I thought the streets told ya 
 Play it frank while I lay in the 
 Beam, let the heat roast ya 
 Thug slash beat composer, 
 Nights filled wit freaks and doser 
 My 
 Benz keeps the baddest bitches, huggin the block 
 Went from rags to riches, don't fuck with snitches 
 Hollow tips sluggin the glock, hollerin "Who let the thug in the spot" 
 Take shorty to the 'Tel blow her back out 
 BENZINO! (Bitches, clips, guns) 
 Black out, inhale blow it back out [deep breathin] 
 And y'all motherfuckers better not act out I go the cash route, plus bet on mash out 
 Burn rubber and leave you niggas assed out [Hook:] 
 G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R, 
 I-B-E-A-C-I-A-O (iaaaaaaaahaha iaaahahahahaa) 
 Chief rocker, whole tribe flooded out 
 He don't know you better tell your man cut it out I'm workin with a short fuse you can't put it out 
 Big money, big guns that's what I'm about 
 Grab a shovel, big meat you might get through ...Deep concentration, I'm at a level that niggas can't get to I'm gangsta part gorilla, part pit bull 
 In other words this dog means business 
 Still do it for my men behind bars, 
 LIFERS I never start a situation that I can't finish 
 Trendsetter, simple and plan, the first in rap music wit a crew on his chain 
 And I'm coming for them belts like 
 Tyson 
 From 
 Wallpoles to 
 Ricards, push 
 Benz's befo I got my license 
 We vultures, street bred, king cobras 
 Keep focus, smoke weed, sip 
 Coronas 
 The saga ends, you can't do nothing for us 
 Spit chorus, bitches can't ignore us [Hook:] (iaaaaahahahaa iaaahahahaa) [Scratching] 
 G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R, 
 I-B-E-A-C-I-A-O 
 Most dangerous, most dangerous, 
 Benzino is m-m-most dangerous, most violent... most dangerous, 
 Benzino is m-m-most dangerous, most violent... 
 Benzino is m-m-most dangerous, most violent... 
 Dro in a blunt twist it up, put four in your gut twist you up 
 You ain't heard not guilty's the verdict [the verdict echoes]
