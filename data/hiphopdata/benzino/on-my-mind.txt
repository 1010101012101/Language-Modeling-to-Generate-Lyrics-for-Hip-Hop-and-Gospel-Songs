Let me tell you all that's on my mind (repeat x4) 
 Why take one bad apple to fuck the whole batch 
 With alot of willpower to get shit back 
 Things got low some habbits have its own track 
 Niggas was hatin' but I ain't here to dwell on that [no] 
 G's dump they packs on 'cause they don't try to slang the shit 
 Lil homies catchin charges they ain't makin' a thing to take 
 Shantes a nympho all she want is weed or dick 
 Frankies on cell ? but he keep on blazin' em 
 Murders on a 6 year Tony's bout to come home 
 DJ's a hustler JV keeps a gun on him 
 Ben pissin a hallways mixed 
 Got a nigga comin' home to such a horrible stench 
 Memorials on every pole and fence 
 Everyday someone's head get clipped for somethin' small as a nit 
 It's like wake after wake if this life ain't a bitch then why police see us all as shit 
 Deep Thoughts and visions of me going 
 Like a tumour in the head I'm fed it keeps growin' 
 But me knowin' never fall and keep holdin' 
 But the size the games showin surprised I ain't foldin 
 Not enough I gotta worry 'bout the hood 
 Some gon do me dirty some gon treat me good 
 And even if I could rewind back time 
 I'll be on the same block with the same ol' grind 
 Girl makin' my head hurt carryin deadweight 
 But I ain't sick that's the road that a man takes 
 But when I break who gon glue me back 
 When chicks kick my pieces and move my act 
 I got the mind of a mad man goin' insane 
 Russian roulette until it blows the back of my brain 
 Things ain't the same I can see that clear 
 Two years in this game but we still here 
 The games changin I told you 
 Record lables can't control me 
 I stay ahead I'm never foldin 
 I'm breakin bread with my soldiers 
 The hood lose no matter whos in office 
 Its really hard to choose when the feds is watchin 
 Niggas doin' time just for simply sellin crack 
 Never really had nothin' but the clothes on their back 
 [Let me tell you] Who I am 
 And I can make you niggas understand 
 I got a lot of things on my mind 
 D.A want me up doin' all my time 
 Niggas droppin' dimes 
 Police stakin out 
 Girls erkin my nerven feel like brakin out 
 Ones I used to love don't care how I make it now 
 All bout being real from north being fake's about
