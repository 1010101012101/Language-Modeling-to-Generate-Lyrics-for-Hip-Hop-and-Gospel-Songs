Is there any boys around 
 Know how to make a girl feel 
 That wanna make a girl feel 
 Make her feel good? 
 All I wanna know 
 Is there any boys around 
 That know how to make a girl feel 
 That wanna make a girl feel 
 Make her feel good? 
 I just wanna know 
 Do I have to tell him how to touch me? 
 Do I have to tell him how to hold me? 
 Do I have to tell him when to call me? 
 Do I have to tell him I'm lonely? 
 Do I have to feel wrong 
 When it ain't strong? 
 Keep my mouth closed? 
 (Huh, huh, huh) 
 Can't a girl from the hood find a homey 
 That ain't just tryin' to hang around me? 
 Do I have to show a nigga I'm a woman? 
 Do I have to apologize for my emotions? 
 Do I have to tell a nigga what to say to me 
 Every time he wanna get next to me? 
 Do I have to set a full cat black case? 
 Stroke 'cause he go 
 (Mmm, girl, no) 
 Can't a chick from the hood find a homey 
 That wanna do more than spend money on me? 
 How come I got a nigga, but can't trust him? 
 Why every answer to my question is a question? 
 Why can't my nigga be my own lil' somethin' 
 And every girl on my block can't say they don' bump wit'? 
 I'm so tired of these so-called, wanna-be, hard, cold pretenders that 
 (Have no clue) 
 Can't a chick from the hood find a homey 
 That I ain't gotta tell how to put it on me? 
 Why, why is it so hard 
 Hard for a girl like me to find a boy 
 That really knows how to make a girl feel? (girl feel, feel) 
 Why is it so hard 
 Hard for a girl like me to find a boy 
 That really knows how to make a girl feel? (girl feel, feel) 
 I just wanna know
