 What's goin' down we can go and kick it like Judo 
 U know wat I mean 
 Shawty got drunk 
 Thought it all was a dream 
 So I made her say ah-ah ah-ah-ah 
 Now she got her hand on my leg 
 Got my seats all wet in my ride (all wet in my ride) 
 All over my ride (all over my ride) 
 She look me dead in the eye (a-eye) 
 Then my pants got bigga 
 She already knew what to figga 
 Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like ah-ah

 With the Henny in they cups 
 Screamin money ain't a thang 
 If it ain't throw it up in the sky 
 And hold ya drinks up high

 If ya lookin' like a model 
 And them grown fellas holla 
 Tell 'em bye 
 Hold ya driks up high
