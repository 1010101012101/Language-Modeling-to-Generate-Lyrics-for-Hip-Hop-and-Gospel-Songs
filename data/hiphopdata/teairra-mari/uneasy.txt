Uh; 
 Can we turn thaa'beat up a lil bit 
 Hit that, yeaaa 
 Right there... 
 Just a smidge tho 
 (1st verse) 
 It's not okay for you to go missing for days 
 Call yer cellphone go straight to voicemail 
 No fair, 'cause if I did it to you 
 You'd prolly think I was out there wit another dude 
 Okay, okay 
 So what tha'sexx good? 
 Bet I could find another I look good 
 On me, on me, on me (on meee) yeaaa! 
 You make it so uneasy 
 For me to love you baby (yeaa) 
 You make it so uneasy 
 For me to trust you baby (yeaaa) 
 You make it so uneasy for me to love you baby yeah 
 You make it so uneasy for me to trust you baby 
 Yeaaa 
 Cause you always lying, lying 
 Why can't you ever keep it official (ficial) 
 You never around me when I need you (need you) 
 You make it uneasy for me, 
 You make it uneasy uneasy for me 
 -Repeat- 
 Seven days later call back but guess what 
 I'm boutta do you how you do me; don't answer 
 Fix yo ass 
 Sit yo ass down 
 Learn a lesson bout love 
 'Cause it's not enough to tell me 
 Gotta show me what's up 
 Okay, okay so what? 
 Thaa'sex good 
 I can find another 
 No prollem I look good 
 On me, on me, on me, on meeeee! 
 Repeat (chorus and bridge) 
 Ooh to love you bby 
 Ooh, to trust you bby 
 Ooh, to need you bby 
 You're making it uneasy 
 You're making it uneasy 
 You're making it 
 Uneasy for meee oh! 
 For me to love you baby 
 For me to trust you baby yeaa 
 Oh for me to love you 
 Oh oh whoa!

 Ah ah ah ha!
