 The you that only I can know 
 Tell me what I gotta do 
 The walls I gotta break through 
 That'll lead me right back to you, ooh 
 'Cause I'm searching boy but I don't have a clue 
 I'm not gon' stop fightin'

 I'll go the end of the world if I have to 
 I'mma keep trying 
 As long as I'm hurting 
 Tell me what I gotta do 
 Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you

 That warm embraceable you, oohoo 
 That walked right out that door 
 What argument can I lose 
 But they can not play a fool 
 Tell me boy what I gotta do, oh baby 
 To figure out why you don't love me no more

 (Verse Three - Pleasure P) 
 She said I've been missin' for a minute 
 I ain't been no where 
 I'm in this motherfucker till we finish 
 And we go back and forth with cursing words like it's tennis 
 See I'm a green fiend 
 I be out here chasing spinach 
 And, and, and she said I don't like your cars 
 I'd rather have your heart 
 You call me your wifey baby let me play the part 
 She hates when we're apart 
 She calls me up whenever I leave 
 She's looking out for me 
 Heeeey, yeah 
 I'm not gon' stop fightin' 
 I'mma keep searchin' 
 I'll go the end of the world if I have to 
 I'mma gon' keep trying 
 As long as I'm hurting 
 Tell me what I gotta do 
 Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you 
 Where you at?
