Ay, ay, uh 
 You love my diamonds don't cha? 
 Let a way a nigga shine, why don't you? 
 Baby, what's your dis position? 
 Have you ever tried this position? 
 You're my dream girl from the posters 
 That I thought I would never get close to 
 In the back limousines with chauffeurs 
 Right next to the test-o-arosters 
 It's funny how all the journey 
 Just gets your cat so purry 
 And it look good altogether 
 They say they all forever 
 You love my diamonds don't cha? 
 That I bought from all this rhythmen 
 But I know you'll never love me 
 You'll only love my diamonds 
 You mess me up on the house of my night 
 I fall in love with you multiple times 
 Got me wrapped around your finger 
 Boy, I hope you like thingas

 You're my one and only rock and a rough 
 I love to hush you, baby, you light me up 
 And there ain't no way I'll give you away 
 He's my d-d-diamond daddy and I just got to have it 
 When I love baby, I'm gonna love ya 
 Just like I love my diamonds 
 Diamonds, diamonds 
 And when I wake up every night

 Diamonds, diamonds

 Diamonds are forever, ice blue, baby

 Like oyster pearls and pretty diamond rings 
 But you're my precious possession
