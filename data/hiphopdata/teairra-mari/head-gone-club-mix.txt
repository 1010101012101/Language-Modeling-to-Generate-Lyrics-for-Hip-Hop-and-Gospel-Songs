Candy hill wit our girl Teairra Mari just get ge ge get it boy 
 Soon as I walked in the club did my thing so I put my hands up, 
 Baby had his eyes on me like he in love 
 (What) his eyes on me like he in love 
 The way that I shake like I'm getin paid 
 Drop it down low make him say hey 
 Loose control and I say go if you don't know 
 Then now you know booo 
 I'm so fly I'm so cool I'm drapped up from my head to my shoes 
 I'm steady rockin' till my heads gone all my bad chicks put your hands up 
 I'm so fly I'm so cool I'm drapped up from my head to my shoes 
 I'm steady rockin' till my heads gone all my bad chicks put your hands up 
 Lets go, turn it up, lets go, fill it up, lets go, 
 Lets go ge-ge-get it boy 
 There was so many fellas in the club tryin' to feel my ooh but they pullin 
 On my uh, fill my glass with some more shon don so I can hurry up and get gone 
 You lovin' my swag the way I throw it back the way I make it rain make him say hey 
 Loose control and I say go if you don't know then now you know boo 
 I'm so fly I'm so cool I'm drapped up from my head to my shoes 
 I'm steady rockin' till my heads gone all my bad chicks put your hands up 
 I'm so fly I'm so cool I'm drapped up from my head to my shoes 
 I'm steady rockin' till my heads gone all my bad chicks put your hands up 
 So suductive took yo man's girl nothin', ice green night 
 Light chain is nothin', tongue grown out, thang poked out, 
 Use the left side of his brain is right minds out I just write mine 
 I take my time, ice on my watch and hes froze in time 
 When I walked in dude started hockin, kiddy walked in 
 Dogs started walkin' 
 I can let you get it can you throw it to the sky let it go look 
 At me your girl don't lie I can get you dumped 
 We can make it hot 'cause the sun is my zone 
 I can get you home if you promise me the moon take me to a suite 
 Drop a thousand on the room put me a lam I can show you how I zoom 
 30 seconds off the end I can show you what a do 
 I'm so fly I'm so cool I'm drapped up from my head to my shoes 
 I'm steady rockin' till my heads gone all my bad chicks put your hands up 
 I'm so fly I'm so cool I'm drapped up from my head to my shoes 
 I'm steady rockin' till my heads gone all my bad chicks put your hands up 
 Lets go, turn it up, lets go, fill it up, lets go, 
 Lets go ge-ge-get it boy 
 I'm steady rockin' till my heads gone, I'm steady rockin' till my heads gone
