Flo-Rida, Teairra, we ain't gotta cause a scene, baby 
 Don't make me, make me cause a scene up in here

 I don't care who's 'bout to see me 'cause a scene up in here 
 I see you out here with your home boys clubbin' 
 Champagne popped off and you bubblin' 
 Sheek shoes but you better tell 'em somethin' 
 You better tell 'em that you're somebody's husband 
 I ain't with that foolishness, no, that ain't what I need tonight 
 But if they keep their hands off you then everythin' will be alright 
 All hot up in here 'cause I'm on that gasoline 
 And you know I'll take my shoes off and grab my Vasoline, oh 
 Don't make me, make me cause a scene up in here 
 Don't make me, make me cause a scene up in here

 Make me, make me cause a scene up in here 
 Don't, I'm demandin' all of my respect 
 I don't care who's 'bout to see me cause a scene up in here, no 
 Your ex girl wanna flirt? Well, she gon' get herself hurt 
 Even though I got on a mini skirt, I still will put in work 
 Don't tell me calm down 'cause I know somebody's doin' wrong 
 It's gon' be trouble when I find out just what's goin' on 
 All hot up in here 'cause I'm on that gasoline 
 And you know I'll take my shoes off and grab my Vasoline, oh 
 Don't make me, make me cause a scene up in here 
 Don't make me, make me cause a scene up in here 
 Don't make me, make me cause a scene up in here

 Don't, I'm demandin' all of my respect 
 I don't care who's 'bout to see me cause a scene up in here

 Listen to me, baby

 I know that you, you do me 
 At the end of the night, they go home, we get grown 
 Uncut or cut, why even cause a scene? 
 Okay, we do have make up sex but I'm not datin' Maybelline 
 Baby, I do got nuff respect 
 If not 'bout these broads, I'm 'bout my cheese 
 To the damn Flo-Rida, ooh, I do love my Teairra Mari 
 Shit, shit, I let mamma, let's be drama free, shawty, you good 
 Left the ghetto, move from the projects, damn, I thought I left the hood 
 Well, then I bought them stilettos to keep somethin' on your foot 
 Now supply me lots of Henny, don't see some bitches get wood 
 I ain't did nothin', I would never ever push your button 
 Then she double ella ella, no way I'ma would stay out of it 
 Oh, my day breakin' up this subject, we gotta take this out in public 
 I, I know you, you my wifey but my boo ain't got your back 
 What'd you say? Don't test me, don't test me 
 I'm demandin' all of my respect 
 I don't care who's 'bout to see me cause a scene up in here, no
