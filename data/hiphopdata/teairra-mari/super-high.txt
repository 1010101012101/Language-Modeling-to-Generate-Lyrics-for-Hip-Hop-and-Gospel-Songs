Wind blowing in my hair 
 No smoke in my air 
 Its sensual 
 Getting call on my phone from a whole nother coast 
 So I gotta turn it off 
 Its simple 
 I just wanna relax besides that my baby is getting impatient 
 Waiting on me to taste that Strawberry wrapp that he holding in his 
 Left hand 
 And it taste so good and it feels so smooth 
 Yeaaaa yeaaa-aaa 
 Break it down roll it up 
 Champain spillin Close my eyes 
 Feeling like I'm on vacation (ooh) 
 We are Super High
