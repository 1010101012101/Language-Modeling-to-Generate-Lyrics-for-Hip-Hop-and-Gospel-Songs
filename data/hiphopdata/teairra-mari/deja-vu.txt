1:i am young and I am old /i am rich and I am poor/ I feel like I've been on this earth many times before/ Once I was a wide gazelle on horseback riding free. Searching in the darkness for a piece of me. 
 Chorus: I can feel this for sure. I've been here before. I-I-I can feel this for sure, for sure, for sure. I've been here before. 
 2:I used to be a queen you know/ On an island by the sea/With rainbow colored people/Hah!/ Happy as can be/ We never had a problem/ There never was a care/ the love was everflowing and it's feeling shared 
 Chorus: And I can feel this 4 sure... 
 Yes I have I can feel it/ I can feel it 
 3: My soul feels like a universe/ the baskin never ends/ stars to me are children/ babies are my friends /My heart is like a galaxy/ In my spirit flies/ I've helped this way a million times/ please don't ask me why/ The question of my lifetime/ you've asked my point of view/ They say it all was karma/ Call it deja vu/ Call it deja vu/ Call it deja vu/ Call it deja vu/ Call it deja vu 
 Chorus: And I can feel this for sure... 
 If hate is on your mind and you can't give up the crime/ Anger is your friend/ Don't you know when you die don't you know you will come back again/ In the master's plan, you will come back woman or man. If your life is full of sin don't you know when you die you will come back again! 
 I thank God! I thank God! I thank God! I am not coming back no more! I've been here before. I thank God! I thank God! I thank God! (I don't want to come back no more!)
