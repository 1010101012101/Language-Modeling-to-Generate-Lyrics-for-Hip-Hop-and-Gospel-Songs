Thinking that you were so smooth 
 But I had my eye on you 
 Couldn't answer your phone 
 Cause your minutes were gone 
 Did you really think I'd play the fool 
 I was there when everybody else was gone 
 So what you're doin' to me now is so wrong 
 You got your nerve fool 
 You say you wanna know babe 
 But I don't know. 
 You wanna know the truth but 
 (Can you handle it?) x2 
 You want it just to you but 
 (Can you handle it?) x2 
 You wanna know the truth but 
 (Can you handle it?) x2 
 Find someone else to fill your shoes boy 
 (I ain't havin' it) 
 (Can you handle it?) 
 Since its time that we come clean 
 Then I must do the same 
 I was creepin' its true 
 Just to get back at you 
 I'm tired playin' in this game 
 Not tryna be stuck here never realize 
 Gotta grow up baby wanna make it right 
 ... 
 You say you wanna know babe but I don't know 
 Not finished...
