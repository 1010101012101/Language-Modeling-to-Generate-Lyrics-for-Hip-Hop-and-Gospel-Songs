Holler 
 We make the boys wanna holler (repeats) 
 You talk 'bout the game but talk is cheap 
 Let's get it popping boy 
 I get lower in a Lamborghini 
 See me ain't no stopping boy 
 I hope that ain't your girlfriend 
 That keeps on rolling eyes like that 
 Like I won't jump over over this table 
 Help her straight and get her eyes right 
 I ain't got a boyfriend 
 I came all alone tonight 
 Like kobe in the Fourth quarter 
 Yeah I'm in my zone tonight 
 I'm gonna pack it up 
 You buy me a drink 
 While I turn it up 
 Tell me what you think 
 It was all a tease 
 But he must look like he sees 
 Cause hes all up in my ear 
 Tryna get me to his crib 
 'Cause I know he wanna touch it 
 I know he wanna touch it 
 Tryna run this game 
 But he must have known my name 
 That boy's been staring at me the whole night 
 And I know he wanna touch it 
 I know he wanna touch it 
 I'll be popping 
 I'll be locking 
 Know it was a sight to see 
 I might even throw it back up on you 
 If I like the beat 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 And the way you rubbing all up on my thighs ... 
 I can ride it like Ciara 
 But my name Ciara 
 And I see a bad bitch when I look in the mirror 
 I'm gonna pack it up 
 You buy me a drink 
 While I turn it up 
 Tell me what you think 
 It was all a tease 
 But he must look like he sees 
 Cause hes all up in my ear 
 Tryna get me to his crib 
 'Cause I know he wanna touch it 
 I know he wanna touch it 
 Tryna run this game 
 But he must have known my name 
 That boy's been staring at me the whole night 
 And I know he wanna touch it 
 I know he wanna touch it 
 All my ladies sayin' 
 If you know they wanna touch it (4x) 
 Talking and twisted 
 When I'm out on the dance floor 
 I am not the girl that you used to be happy for 
 And Even though you love it 
 You can never touch 
 Go and see your prince 
 Grab all the deals 
 I'm gonna pack it up 
 You buy me a drink 
 While I turn it up 
 Tell me what you think 
 It was all a tease 
 But he must look like he sees 
 Cause hes all up in my ear 
 Tryna get me to his crib 
 'Cause I know he wanna touch it 
 I know he wanna touch it 
 Tryna run this game 
 But he must have known my name 
 That boy's been staring at me the whole night 
 And I know he wanna touch it 
 I know he wanna touch it
