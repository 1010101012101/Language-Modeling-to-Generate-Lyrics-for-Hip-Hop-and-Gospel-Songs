I should have thought twice before, before I gave you my hand, 
 And let you take a part of me, that I want back, 
 And now I'm all tangled up, sitting here stuck on you, 
 How did I let it get this far? 
 I should have never fell in love, I should have known you are the one. 
 I should have seen it from the start, that you're going break my heart. 
 I should have kept you a stranger... I won't fight everyday. 
 A stranger... a simple hi, how's your day? 
 We should have thought about it a little bit longer, before I let you in... 
 I should have kept you a stranger... I won't fight everyday. 
 A stranger... a simple hi, how's your day? 
 I shoulda have never made that mistake I did, when I let you into my life? 
 Oh... 
 I feel so empty now, I gotta move on but how 
 Don't think I ever will believe in love again? 
 After I gave you second chance for you to turn around and let me down 
 How will I ever trust again? 
 I should have never fell in love, I should have known you are the one 
 I should have seen it from the start, that you're going break my heart 
 I should have kept you a stranger... I won't fight everyday. 
 A stranger... a simple hi, how's your day? 
 We should have thought about it a little bit longer, before I let you in... 
 I should have kept you a stranger... I won't fight everyday. 
 A stranger... a simple hi, how's your day? 
 I shoulda have never made that mistake I did, when I let you into my life? 
 I wish I stayed away, 
 I wish I didn't hurt, 
 I wish I didn't cry everynight before bed... 
 I should have never gave you my heart. I should have never wasted my time. 
 I should have never let you in. I wish I never met you. 
 I should have kept you a stranger... I won't fight everyday. 
 A stranger... a simple hi, how's your day? 
 We should have thought about it a little bit longer, before I let you in... 
 I should have kept you a stranger... I won't fight everyday. 
 A stranger... a simple hi, how's your day? 
 I shoulda have never made that mistake I did, when I let you into my life? 
 I should have kept you a stranger 
 Oh oh oh oh... 
 I said it babe.
