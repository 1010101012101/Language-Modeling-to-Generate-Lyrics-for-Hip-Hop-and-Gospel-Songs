Teairra Mari Hunt 4 You Feat Pleasure P. Lyrics 
 I'm looking for you 
 That sweet incredible you 
 That unforgettable you 
 The you that only I can know 
 Tell me what I gotta do 
 What walls I gotta break through 
 That'll lead me right back to you[ooh] 
 'Cause I'm searching boy... but I don't have a clue 
 I'm not gon stop fighting 
 I'm gon' keep searching 
 I'll go to the end of the world if I have to 
 I'm gon' keep trying as long as I'm hurting 
 Tell me what I gotta do 
 'Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 'Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 I'm looking for you 
 That irreplaceable you 
 That warm embraceable you[ooh] 
 That walked right out that door 
 What argument can I lose? 
 What day can I play a fool? 
 Tell me boy what I gotta do 
 To figure out why you don't luv me no more 
 I'm not gon stop fighting 
 I'm gon' keep searching 
 I'll go to the end of the world if I have to 
 I'm gon' keep trying as long as I'm hurting 
 Tell me what I gotta do 
 'Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at?

 'Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at?

 (Pleasure P.) 
 She said I've been missing for a minute 
 I ain't been no where 
 I'm in this mudafuqa... till we finish 
 And we go back and forth 
 With cursing words like its Tina's 
 'Cause I'm a green thing 
 I'll be out here chasing spinach 
 And she said 
 I don't want your cars 
 I'd rather have your heart 
 Yeah you call me you wifey 
 Baby let me play the part 
 She hates when were apart 
 She calls me up whenever I leave 
 She's looking out for me[hey... yeah] 
 I'm not gon stop fighting 
 I'm gon' keep searching 
 I'll go to the end of the world if I have to 
 I'm gon' keep trying as long as I'm hurting 
 'Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 'Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 I'm not go' stop fighting 
 I'm gon' keep searching 
 I'm gon' keep trying as long as I'm hurting 
 'Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 'Cause boy I'm on the hunt for you 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at? 
 Where you at 
 Where you at?
