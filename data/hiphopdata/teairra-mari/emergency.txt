Uh-oh I did it againnnnn 
 Just when I thought I couldn't fall no deeper 
 Somehow I bumped right into himmmm 
 I guess the game of love is ready to begin 
 Another page added to the story 
 Feelings are hard to pretenddddd 
 I thought my heart just couldn't get much weaker 
 But somehow it bruises breaks and bends 
 I want to hate him but he hits me with that grinnn 
 And now I'm back in love againnnnn no-u-whoa 
 Emergency I got this feeling 
 Emergency I need your healing me 
 So send rescue hear for meeee 
 It's an emergency 
 Emergency I think I'm hopeless (hopeless) 
 Emergency I'm losing focus how could this thing happen to meeee 
 Oh eeemergency 
 Can't get him out of my mind 
 I'm so infatuated with his swagger 
 His style is so one of a kind 
 I think of him I wish I could press rewind 
 My hero's finally coming for me 
 I can't take rejection thisss timeee 
 My heart is still bleeding from the last dagger 
 I vowed to leave the pain behinddd 
 And baby love is like a mountain I can't climb 
 Just when I thought that I was fineee whoa whoa 
 Emergency I got this feeling 
 Emergency I need your healing me 
 So send rescue hear for meeee 
 It's an emergency 
 Emergency I think I'm hopeless (hopeless) 
 Emergency I'm losing focus how could this thing happen to meeee 
 Oh eeemergency
