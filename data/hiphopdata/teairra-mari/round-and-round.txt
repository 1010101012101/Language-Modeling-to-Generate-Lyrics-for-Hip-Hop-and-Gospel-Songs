You know... 
 I never understood 
 Why we go through the same things 
 Over and over 
 Baby, I'm tired 
 I'm so damn tired... 
 You wake up in the morning breakfast on the table (huh, huh and it done) 
 I go to (?) A bath and turn on the cable (huh, boy don't act like you don't know it) 
 You can be straight up with me boy ain't nobody listning (huh tell me what are we doing) 
 'Cause I don't wanna waste my time and I don't wanna waste your time (what the hell are we doing) 
 I've given all I've got what do I have to show for it 
 Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
 I forgive you on the spot then I wait for you to change but 
 Nothin', nothin', nothin', 
 Got me going round and round and round in circles 
 'Cause I loved you (I really) loved you 
 Going round and round and round in circles 
 'Cause I loved you (I really) loved you 
 Round and round and round we go 
 Round and round and round we go 
 Round and round we go 
 Round and round we go 
 Round and round we go 
 Round and round we go 
 Tell me who you gunna find to do it like me (huh, huh ain't nobody) 
 And I know you think I'm old well boy I might be (don't let that good girl shit fool ya) 
 From the laundry to the dirty dishes broken promises and wishes 
 Every day is something different ain't no tellin' who you kissin' 
 I've given all I've got what do I have to show for it 
 Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', 
 I forgive you on the spot then I wait for you to change but 
 Nothin', nothin', nothin', 
 Got me going round and round and round in circles 
 'Cause I loved you (I really) loved you 
 Going round and round and round in circles 
 'Cause I loved you (I really) loved you 
 Round and round and round we go (round and round and round baby) 
 Round and round and round we go 
 Round and round we go 
 Round and round we go 
 Round and round we go 
 Round and round we go 
 Thought that we could make it through the storm (the storm) 
 But now I see that I was so so, so wrong 
 Boy who would have ever thought that we just wouldn't work 
 Boy it hurts oh baby that we just keep going round in circles 
 Got me going round and round and round in circles 
 'Cause I loved you (I really) loved you 
 Going round and round and round in circles 
 'Cause I loved you, loved you 
 I really really 
 I really really 
 I really really 
 Loved, we go, we go 
 I can't even sleep 
 Sometimes I feel so empty 
 Oh baby so dizzy oh
