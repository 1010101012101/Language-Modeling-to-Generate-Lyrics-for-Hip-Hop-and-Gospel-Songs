(Kanye West) 
 I love it though 
 I love it though 
 You know 
 Uh put your hands to the constellations 
 They way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation 
 I know I'm preaching to the congregation 
 We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan 
 (Tearra Mari) 
 See there's three sides to every story 
 But I can tell which side you on 
 Sayin' that you beg me to forgive 
 The same night you go out and do wrong 
 You say baby don't leave 
 You know how long I've been waitin 
 Say the way I look is a sin 
 You call me your sinsation 
 I swear these niggas is a trip sometimes 
 Even the devil know how to use church lines 
 I can't take it no more 
 Walking out the door 
 What was I waitin for 
 Did you think I wasn't gonna say anything 
 I alreay got my bags packed up 
 Truck packed up 
 To the door, pedal to the floor 
 On the highway, doin' it my way 
 I don't want to take your shit no more 
 No more 
 No more 
 No more 
 No more 
 What would I continue to take you shit for 
 (Rick Ross) 
 Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone 
 Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
