I was mesmerized 
 The first time, I saw, your face 
 I could see your eyes 
 They kept me in a daze 
 I must have been hypnotized (hypnotized) 
 By your heavenly smile (Mmm Hmm) 
 But unfortunately, it'd be the last time I would see you 
 Oh but I'll... 
 Dream of you, every time I'd (go away) 
 I'll think about you everyday 
 I'm feeling you, in everyway (show to show) 
 Hope show to show, I hope I see you where I go (everywhere, where I go) 
 Oh boy now don't you know (don't you know) 
 You're my fantasy.
