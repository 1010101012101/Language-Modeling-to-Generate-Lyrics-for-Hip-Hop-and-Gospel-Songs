 To figure out why you don't love me no more

 But I ain't been no where 
 I'm in this muh'fucka till we finish 
 And we go back and forth with cursing words like it's tennis 
 'Cause I'm a green fiend I b out here chasing spinach 
 And (and) she said "I don't want your cars I rather have your heart 
 U call me your wifey baby let me play the part" 
 She hates when we're apart 
 She calls me up when ever I leave 
 She looking out 4 me yeah
