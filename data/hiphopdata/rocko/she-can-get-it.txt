She can get it [x3] 
 Shawty look good even when da lights on got me starin' 
 Got me thinkin' bout bringin' yo ass back home girl I'm not playin' 
 O she can get it (right now) 
 She can get it (right now) 
 She can get it (right now) 
 She can get it (right now) 
 Who is dis girl 
 Where she from 
 O o o no but I dig her campaign she got my vote 
 I ain't tryna stare 
 But I don't care 
 Let's play magic baby 
 Let's disappear 
 Let's get out of here get in my car 
 Roll up a gar (then what) 
 Let's go to my spot (go to my spot) 
 It ain't dat far (it ain't dat far) 
 I'm a keep it real (keep it real) 
 Dis ain't my style (dis ain't my style) 
 But all I see is me and u 
 Right here right now 
 Da way you lookin' right now girl you know you right 
 Only thing on my mind is you on my motor bike 
 Wat you say you sing 
 Show you right 
 Microphone check da night 
 Culd be yo lucky night 
 I can't help but stare 
 Yo swagg outta here 
 Only thing in mind is gettin' you out yo final wear 
 Just gimme the word baby 
 We ain't worryin how 
 I ain't tryna wait we can do it right now 
 I'm a make it rain 
 I'm a make it sleet 
 And watch you rain dance grind and shake it to da beat 
 I'm a team playa so bring yo home girl 
 Y'all just let it go get off in yo own world 
 I just kick bak and let you do yo thang 
 While I pull yo hair and make you say my name 
 She told me stop playin' 
 She say boy you wild 
 I said I'm dead serious you can get it right now
