Tony fuck with Stan 
 But see Stan he the man 
 Dat boy Stan got guap, he a fool with the yam 
 But see Stan fuck with Tony 
 He don't know that Tony phony 
 And that Tony just got jammed 
 Last week with some money 
 And about ten of them bunnies 
 Listen what they told Tony (What) 
 He a free man 
 'Cause what they really want is Stan 
 Whole time this nigga Stan 
 Thinking Tony is his man 
 Thinking Tony work with him 
 But Tony working with the Man 
 Thinking Tony got a plan 
 Told Stan about this man 
 Told him that his sister husband tryna cop around ten 
 Stan said let's make it happen 
 But what Stan don't understand 
 It's today the last day 
 He'll see the light again 
 But Tone don't give a damn 
 Anything to save him 
 Even if that mean he got to send his nigga to the can 
 Take heed of what I'm saying 
 Before it's too late 
 Just beware of phony niggas that be smiling in your face 
 Kim and Janet best friends 
 And they been that way for years 
 Janet single but see Kim got a nigga and two kids 
 Janet babysit her kids 
 Janet loves them like they're hers 
 Janet needs a place to live 
 So Kim let her come live with them 
 Kim knows her just like her fam 
 But what Kim don't understand 
 Is that Janet's not her kin 
 Janet's not even her friend 
 Janet's tryna seek revenge 
 Janet's got a plan 
 Janet's still holding a grudge from back when her and Kim were ten 
 She devised a perfect plan 
 Janet's gon sleep with her man 
 She lays naked in the kitchen wait for him to come in 
 He walks in the door like damn 
 You know a man gon be a man 
 In the mist of all of that he must forgot about Kim 
 Kim bust's in on them 
 Janet stands there with her grin 
 Kim fussin, cussin, hollerin, screamin going straight nuts on them 
 Kim crying out like damn 
 Jan I thought you were my friend 
 Janet said, "You remember you took my boyfriend back when we were ten." Damn 
 Michael real cool nigga but he just not getting money (how) 
 Drought came around 
 He fixed up niggas for some dummies 
 Now he ballin like a dog 
 Every night he in the club 
 Throwing money, popping bottles, flexing hard 
 He don't give a fuck 
 Then one night he met this girl 
 Finest girl he ever saw 
 He say I never seen before 
 She say I'm here from Arkansas 
 They kicked it off a couple months 
 She fucked and sucked him like a pole 
 He say I love your dirty drawers baby I never let you go 
 Year later they're still together 
 Now he feeling like he love her 
 So he let her in his business 
 'Cause he felt like he could trust her 
 She sitting in the kitchen while he busting down dem bricks 
 She thumbing through the check 
 He swear he got a gangster bitch 
 Well he don't know about this bitch 
 Cause everything she say a lie 
 Man this bitch ain't who she say she is 
 This bitch is FBI 
 Man this game a dirty game 
 Man be well for the tricks 
 Before you end up just like Mike 
 Be sitting in jail about a bitch
