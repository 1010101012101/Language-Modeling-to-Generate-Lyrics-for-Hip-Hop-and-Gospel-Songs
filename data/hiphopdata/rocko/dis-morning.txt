This morning, (What?) I woke up 
 Feeling like money (What'd you do?) 
 I jumped up 
 Put on my Gucci's (And what?) 
 And my hat (What else?) 
 Got my bag (What else?) 
 Got my strap 
 Gotta start rollin' 
 I was thinking (Bout what?) 
 Bout jacks and cracks and Ben Franklins 
 (Only thing on my mind) 
 Was Gettin' Dough (What's on your mind?) 
 Gettin' Dough (What's on your mind?) 
 Gettin' Dough 
 Only thing on my mind is 
 Money, Money, Money 
 For some reason she just be callin my name 
 (Rocko, Rocko) 
 I guess it's all in the game 
 'Cause I always run get her 
 She's a part of me man 
 I left the studio at 7 
 Took a three hour nap (Then?) 
 10 o'clock flashed 
 I'm right back in the trap 
 Been addicted to the money 
 For more than half my life 
 Grew up fast, I bought a car 
 Ain't never had a wife 
 Lost playa type of cat 
 I never had a wife (Why?) 
 I'm married to the cash 
 She treat her daddy right 
 What would I do 
 If I ain't had my muscle? 
 What would I do 
 If I ain't have this hustle? 
 From that geek o 
 Wake up, Get up 
 Time to get dough 
 The only thing on my mind 
 Is the bubba 
 So I can all my n****s out the gutta 
 The only thing on my mind 
 Is to be the best 
 Number 1, won't settle for anything less 
 The only thing on my mind 
 Is do my thing (What else?) 
 Break bread with my team 
 The only thing on my mind 
 Is to stack my cash 
 Ball e'ry day just like it's my last 
 The only thing on my mind 
 Is my kids 
 So they ain't gotta do the s*** that I did 
 The only thing on my mind 
 Is money, money, money
