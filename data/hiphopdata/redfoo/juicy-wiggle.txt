(Juicy) 
 I walked into the party. I seen somethin' I never saw. 
 Everybody was movin' grovin' 
 Girls, they were dancin' on the bar. 
 Now this wasn't no ordinary dance. 
 (Hey man why is everybody swimmin' in a trance?) 
 I couldn't figure it out like your grandpa's riddle, 
 I asked 'em what they doin' and they said Juicy wiggle! 
 (Now move your hips and dance like fish) 
 Get juicy. 
 Get juicy. 
 Yeah, get juicy. 
 Get juicy. 
 Get juicy. 
 Yeah, get juicy. 
 Whoo wee 
 Now I done just lost my mind. 
 All those people wiggling they stuff. 
 (Hey man, you gonna do the dance?) 
 Man turn down for what!? 
 Give me a shot (woo!) another shot (woo!) 
 Y'all ain't ready for me to show you what I got. (woo!) 
 Then my body froze'd up, it was getting to my head. 
 What if I can't do it? Then everybody said... 
 Ah, get juicy. 
 Ah, get juicy. 
 Ah, get juicy. 
 Ah, get juicy. 
 Two girls was shakin' it, I jumped in the middle 
 I asked 'em what we doin' and they said Juicy Wiggle! 
 Get juicy. 
 Get juicy. 
 Yeah, get juicy. 
 Get juicy. 
 Get juicy. 
 Yeah, get juicy. 
 Right about now, we really gonn' have some fun! (oh yeah?) 
 I'm talking bout ticklin' ivory (woo!) 
 But first, I need some 151 and a match (Woo Wei!) 
 It's time to light it up, lets go now! 
 Ah, get juicy. 
 Ah, get juicy. 
 Ah, get juicy.

 Ain't nothin' wrong with makin' it jiggle, 
 So when the beat drops, everybody juicy wiggle 
 Get juicy.

 Yeah, get juicy. 
 Get juicy. 
 Get juicy.

 So when the beat drops everybody juicy wiggle 
 Yeah baby
