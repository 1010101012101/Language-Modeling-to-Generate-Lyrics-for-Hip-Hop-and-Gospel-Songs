She's moving up, down, all around 
 She's moving up, down, all around 
 (Bounce bounce bounce) 
 She's moving up, down, all around 
 In a high class place with a white girl ghetto 
 Up, down, all around 
 She's moving up, down, all around 
 (Bounce bounce bounce) 
 She's moving up, down, all around 
 In a high class place with a white girl ghetto 
 Yeah! 
 Tonight I've got a party to throw 
 At the party Roc Nation gon' be nothing for sure 
 Yeah, me and my crew feeling restless 
 We need some more booties on the guest list 
 First stop is the gas station, I like to call it the ass station 
 I always see girls bumping it up, I stumble on up 
 I say Whassup! and ask questions 
 Excuse me, what you're doing tonight?! 
 I got a party at my crib, I'm picking you to invite 
 Uh, she got a booty that's out the frame 
 I nicknamed it high octane 
 I made her laugh, told her some of that 
 And in a flash, we walked away with the math 
 Next stop, whole foods 
 Me and the crew we call it hoe foods 
 It'd cracking on the weekend 
 The only place you could find a big booty on the vegan 
 Her name was Shelly, tattoos and a ring on her belly 
 The only problems that her arms were smelly 
 It didn't matter to me, 'cause all that jelly 
 I'm a booty man, booty man, booty man 
 I'm a booty man, booty man 
 Booty-do-booty-do-booty man 
 Booty man, booty man 
 In a high class place with a white girl ghetto 
 I'm a booty man, booty man, booty man 
 I'm a booty man, booty man 
 Booty-do-booty-do-booty man 
 Booty man, booty man 
 In a high class place with a white girl ghetto 
 Up, down, all around 
 She's moving up, down, all around 
 (Bounce bounce bounce) 
 She's moving up, down, all around 
 In a high class place with a white girl ghetto 
 Chilling at the Roosevelt, faded as fuck 
 About to go home 'cause I'm way too stuck 
 Too man guys, this party's dead 
 Then I see your big booty, eyes pop out my head like 
 Ouuuuuuuu! 
 I started shuffling 
 In the circle, I was hustling and bustling
