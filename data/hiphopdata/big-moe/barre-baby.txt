It's the Barre baby (huh?) 
 The Barre baby (who?) 
 The Barre baby (what?) 
 The Barre baby 
 Now for all y'all who ain't heard of me 
 It's da M.O.E. the Barre baby 
 I'm a south side living legend 
 A third ward, bone hard street veteran 
 It all started in 93' 
 High school I was a fool I was only 18 
 With the dreams of becoming a ghetto superstar 
 Rollin' a foregin car through the streets of third ward 
 It was hard momma saw me with a case of codine 
 And promethazyne now I'm a codine fiend 
 And my team was the coldest everyday we rolled thick 
 Niggas and hoes on dick because the screwed up click 
 And I'm the 
 Barre Baby 
 The Barre baby 
 That M.O.E. from that S.U.C. 
 Barre baby 
 The Barre baby 
 Now I got the whole world sippin drank with me 
 Now the introduction has been made 
 Time to get paid, time to get laid 
 Time to ball and parlay 
 Time to smoke hay 
 Time for versace shades 
 Make my trunk wave 
 Time to get sprayed 
 This is for my niggas in the cage, living in a rage 
 See mo-yo done turned the page 
 Put down the gage, it's me my mic and my stage 
 >From the cradle to the grave 
 See I keeps a bald fade 
 So clean and on codine and lemonade 
 I gotta stay paid 'cause I'm tha 
 Barre Baby 
 The Barre baby 
 That M.O.E. screaming S.U.C. 
 Barre baby 
 The Barre baby 
 Now I got the whole world sippin drank with me
