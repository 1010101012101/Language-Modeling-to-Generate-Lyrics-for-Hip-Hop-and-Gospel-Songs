 Got a cup full of mud and my trunk is knockin'

 Hollering what it do 
 Hitting circles throug the lot like I'm in a hula-hoop 
 Who the crew that stang these streets like bees 
 We the G's that be's and I'll flow from over seas 
 Hold the trees big moe while I split the optimo 
 In a wide body Benz-O going bout 4 
 Oh, the ex-o just hit me where it hurt 
 I'm bout to jump down and flirt 
 And get up some skirts 
 Let the ice do the work 
 Put us up in the dentist 
 After we hit the lenards till they know who sent us 
 You can fuck 
 But your ass can't stay and drank drank
