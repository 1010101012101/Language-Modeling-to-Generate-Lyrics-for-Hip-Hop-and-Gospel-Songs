 That butta-scotch (the color of his car) 
 Off mono-blocks 
 We cut 'em off 
 That interstate 
 We pull on mine 
 Got penny weight 
 Never seen him drive 
 One-hunny boy (one hundred) 
 Ask about me 
 I'm something like a holocaust 
 I drop it about my pocket 
 And I don't know what the hell it cost 
 See it's hilarious, I cracks myself up 
 I sell out in the stars 
 While y'all back the shelf up. 
 That break shop nikka 
 Betta tell them suckas deep (grave) 
 When he break on the CD's be j (j-dog) (pun to bj) 
 I'm a houstunna slash 
 Straight it was reach (j) 
 That houston Texas 
 Try 100 how to respect it 
 Yeah, lil homie game so marvelous 
 One hundred, its obvious 
 Excuse me, beg my pardon 
 I'm barely parkin' 
 But my lights are sparkin' 
 Duckin' in vomit, vomit 
 In my leather nintendo is marga-nous 
 I'm full of them pills 
 I'm still
