(Ronnie Spencer) 
 Mmmmmm.hhhhmmmm we balling 
 And parlay yeah Moe-yo 
 (Chorus:Big Moe and Ronnie rp2x) 
 We ball and we parlay 
 I told ya this time 
 That we top of the line 
 (Big Moe) 
 System, Navigator on the southside 
 We melt them trays yeah hit it in the six 
 That purple stuff wit a cup of the mix 
 That sounded so throwed and believe it so throwed 
 I can't believe it's so slow 
 (Trademark) 
 Windows closed cruise control wit some lil doe 
 Bout to lose her clothes there she go 
 Hoe tripping again she pancaked I flipped 8 
 And let me flip her again 
 It's been a long, long time coming 
 But it won't be a long time for long huh 
 (Bridge:Big Moe) 
 Everytime I come around what do I see? 
 I see ghetto dreams coming true 
 Everytime I'm coming down on things 
 Top down everyday got to ball and parlay 
 (Big Moe) 
 Throw a duece when you see me Big Meezy 
 I make the game look easy sit up on my grind 
 Stay up on my toes slip-slipped out the do' 
 Frosty so cold like its deep in southpole 
 (Billy Crook)
