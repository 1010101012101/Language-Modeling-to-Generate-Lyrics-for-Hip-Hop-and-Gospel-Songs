(Big Moe) 
 Well it ain't plex with the East and the West 
 And plenty drink for your kids and plenty of weed for your chest 
 So leave your pistol at home 'cause we ain't trying to go to war 
 The common denominator in the sitution is calm like a star you can shine with 
 Roll on 20's and smoke pine with me 
 C'mon they tryin' to leave you're mine with me 
 Steady be sellin, celebratin', for payin' our dues 
 So much drank in my cup cause the water don't move 
 As a playa! and associate with the plexin 
 Bone hard, bitch, Monroe City, Texas 
 A veteran don't get me wrong cause put you a glass 
 Pour you a glass instead of beating on your ass 
 Take a chill pill pill 
 Plow some kill pop the steal 
 Since we won't ba seen 
 Sippin syrup till we leave 
 From the thirty-third coast it ain't no roach a G 
 So split your 4 to the Remi and have a toast degree 
 (Chorus: repeat 2X) 
 All I wanna do, is bang screw 
 In my thirty-third, see I'm syrup bangin' screw 
 (Big Moe) 
 Big Moe don steped in (2X) 
 I done knocked out twins (2X) 
 Moe-yo comin' down I'm throwed 
 But I'm outta control this Big Moe 
 I'ma let you know (2X) 
 I done let the po 4 (2X) 
 And I'ma bout to sip mo than moe-yo 
 It's Big Moe drank baby 
 I done came down (2X) 
 Up out H-Town (2X) 
 And you know throwed a G 
 The M-O-E cocked up on three 
 I'm comin' down threw in my day moe-yooooo 
 Screwwwyeah 
 Moe comin' down made that candy wet moe-yoooo 
 Said a moeoooo 
 Big Moe down the 4 
 Y2K with my headlights on 
 Crossin threw the yellowstone 
 Bout to scoop me a yellowbone 
 Po sex to my stop one 
 Time for me to play my song 
 And they better leave Moe alone 
 In other words just sing the song 
 (Big Moe) 
 In the city of syrup we like to jam music slow 
 Still come up substance make them hit the floor 
 84's and vouls with the freshes on my lows 
 Specialy on the fours doors 
 Bump the strape againts rows 
 Flosh low concert looking like a lumber yard 
 Waving my trunk up and down the boulevard 
 Charge the platinum card and the visa to the max! 
 Still won't get no sleep till my click see some cacs 
 Cadillacs and six packs we guys bangin' screw 
 Click click clack, get yor wimp ass threw 
 Payin' do's and stayin tru is the rule of the game 
 On top of the food chains 
 Bangin' screw it won't change for nothin'
