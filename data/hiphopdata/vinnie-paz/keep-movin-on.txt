I lost my job at the factory and that's disastrous 
 They said it's due to regulation and higher taxes 
 They ain't give me no notice, they knocked me off my axis 
 I can't pay the electric bill, it's total blackness 
 I suggested some incentives for innovation 
 But that was met with resistance like it's a sin of Satan 
 I'm losing my patience over here, I'm sick of waiting 
 And I ain't never expect to be in this situation 
 And the manufacturing jobs are fading fast 
 Can't do nothing else, I should've stayed in class 
 I have to wait till summertime to cut the blades of grass 
 I have this little bit of money, have to make it last 
 I have children to feed, I have a loving wife 
 I had a hard time coming that was nothing nice 
 I keep asking myself what am I doing wrong 
 And they just look at me and tell me keep it movin' on 
 Keep movin' on 
 But I don't know where to go 
 Nowhere to go 
 Keep movin' on 
 It was like '91, '92 
 I remember people telling us that ain't nobody signing you 
 There's no Italians or Puerto Ricans that's shining through 
 Y'all should just go back and just do what y'all was designed to do 
 We ain't listened to none of that, we hard-headed 
 We took it back to the lab and then the god set it 
 We smoked els, drank liquor and we got wetted 
 And everything we did back then was barbaric 
 Around '94 had some labels take notice 
 They said that Stoupe was the illest but that I ain't focused 
 The label execs needed to be explained dopeness 
 And that's around the time I thought that it became hopeless 
 We was still in the street, D was moving strong 
 I was failing out of school, it wasn't cool with moms 
 I was asking myself, "What was we doing wrong?" 
 And why the industry keep saying to keep it movin' on 
 I signed up 'cause they promised me some college money 
 I ain't the smartest motherfucker but I'm not a dummy 
 They told me I would be stationed in places hot and sunny 
 I had a lot of pride, motherfuckers got it from me 
 These people over here innocent, they never harmed me 
 My sergeant tried to convince me that they would try to bomb me 
 I feel like an outsider stuck inside this army 
 Everybody brainwashed, American zombies 
 I ain't realised how much it set me back 
 Until I lost my leg and then they sent me back 
 I don't have anything now I'm left with scraps 
 From a government who created AIDS, invented crack 
 People told me not to join, I tried to prove 'em wrong 
 Now I'm homeless and I'm cold without no food is worm 
 I keep asking myself, "What did I do that's wrong?" 
 And the government telling me keep it movin' on
