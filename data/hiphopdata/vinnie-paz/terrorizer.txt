Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 Ayo I'm quiet calm, write my greatest shit when the light gon' 
 My hand fast like Ramadan with a knife drawn 
 I'm the physical of Tsunami, you a slight storm 
 This is a spiritual anomaly, a fight song 
 To guard you now directly in my right palm 
 Nuffin' new about it, keep the ratchet with me lifelong 
 I come through polar caps melt, ice gon' 
 My mother cryin' to my brother why is his life wrong? 
 Concrete gospel - Allahu Akbar! 
 Crooked D's in front of the crib inside a parked car 
 Gumar-Oz-Dubar inside the shot bar 
 Darts fly inside you and severe you like a sharp star 
 If we ain't livin' in hell I'm tellin' you it's hot Ba 
 Masonic manifestation of God is not far 
 In reality the sun is just a hot star 
 The Earth is just a ball of shit is where I stop Ba
