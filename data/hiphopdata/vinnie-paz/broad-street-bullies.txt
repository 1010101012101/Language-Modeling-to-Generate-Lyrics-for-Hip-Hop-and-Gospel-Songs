Verse 1 - Planetary: 
 Yo, the Outerspace lord vibrate floors like bass chords 
 Embrace more lyrics, blastin' your face off 
 Levels changed, Planetary feed you metal pain 
 I shoot you with rhymes like niggas carry metal aim 
 Then call it insincere, flat like what commercial artist wear 
 My squad bare the treasure, lettin' my knowledge flare 
 The god is here, comin' through just as sharp as a snare 
 Super emcee, watch me throw this dart in your ear and ?? repair 
 So when I spit you take notes 
 We tearin' this roof off, blazin' with brain smoke 
 Everytime I set off flames I'm on the stage toked 
 I amaze folks they minds like waterproof rain coats 
 On the train row, look at how a wrote my name dope 
 I'm the center of attention, like parade floats 
 Everything I say float, put it in your magazine 
 Don't sleep, Broad Street Bullies will shatter your dreams 
 A nightmare, leave your stupid ass layin' right heres 
 It's a damn shame, we the only cats that deservin' mics here 
 It's all tight here, you on my stage then get off 
 You look like a bitch, take all that shiny shit off 
 Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz: 
 Yo, the game spilled, we maim those you claim ill 
 Hit up the intricate studies on how the pain feel 
 The insane skill that come through me 
 It's from bangin' "All Hell Freeze" by Cool C. 
 Y'all don't move me, y'all at war with the veteran 
 With a digital trigger finger like a letterman 
 The vendetta gram, I know where my heart's at 
 I'm the better man, so don't start that 
 Or we bomb back, you burn fuckin' leeches 
 Send you to hell, you see more shells than beaches 
 Never defeat us, we from Hamburger Hill 
 Science and math combined with supreme skill 
 Team ill, we send you to hell fast 
 The green field, you buried in Belfast 
 I smell trash, and it's standin' right next to me 
 Back off, or swim with the sharks like John Kennedy 
 We the remedy, forever stay fresh 
 Broad Street Hologram till the last breath, baby 
 What the fuckin' deal, the mic manglers 
 Broad Street, '99 steadily shine 
 Sean C., ?? ?? 
 Joe Mashfield, smash you in your debt and grill 
 Come battle, we'll rip your fuckin' neck off 
 What?
