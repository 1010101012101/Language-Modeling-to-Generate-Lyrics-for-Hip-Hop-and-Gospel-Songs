Turn the fuckin' beat on. 
 Verse 1 - Demoz: 
 Hold up nigga, pass the weed, let me roll up nigga 
 Ali, your eyes swolled up nigga 
 I'm from the city where the murders don't go down, they go up nigga 
 In the car, where I blow up niggas 
 'Give a fuck if your kid is ridin' with you, he gon' blow up with you 
 Bet a bird for a battle I'mma show up quicker 
 Cut a bird into half, you get burnt for your stash 
 Bet money, no drugs, you get burnt for your cash nigga 
 I'll burn your fuckin' face to the ass 
 Put the ash in the urn, and put the fuckin' urn in the trash 
 Shoot your man in the head till he swerve and he crash 
 Then run up on him with the burnout, show him what the burn about 
 Now he's back to the county over nothing 
 And my man he in the outty, with a fatty and a bucket of that Jose Quevo 
 The xenes and the dutches 
 Got me feelin' like a cat no more, Vinnie fuck yeah 
 Verse 2 - Vinnie Paz: 
 It's blood everywhere, I can hardly see through the gun smoke 
 Bush got the streets fucked up, brothers dumb broke 
 I ain't even gotta be upset to get son poked 
 I don't get my hands dirty G, that's for young folk 
 I don't get my hands dirty at all 
 I don't think you mothafuckers even worry to brawl 
 We certainly ball, we certainly absurdly raw 
 We would purposely refer you to the surgery floor 
 And let you die mothafucker we don't care about you 
 Let my cousin Demoz squeeze the air out you 
 Run the chain faggot, beat the 9th gears out you 
 My hands sharp and fast, I'll beat the hairs out you 
 I'm just something you could never contain 
 I'm just something that could pray and bring a heavily rain 
 Allah Akbar, heavenly plain 
 Allah Akbar, heavenly plain 
 Yo D what up daddy. Louie Dogs. Vin Laden.
