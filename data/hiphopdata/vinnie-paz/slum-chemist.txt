The God Of The Serengeti 
 The lion king 
 I like that y'all consider me the bad guy 
 Big guns everywhere, bullets where I pass by 
 My blood's g-code, never seen my dad cry 
 And I'ma bleed your block 'til the cash dry 
 You live in fuckin' Babylon and ask why 
 Your arms to short to box, god, that's why 
 So watch a big mouth turn into a cracked eye 
 Watch a big house turned into a smashed sty 
 Send them to the devil, let his ass fry 
 Heavy metal on another level, that's high 
 I self lord and master from past tribe 
 I let my young bol trash you from bad vibes 
 Reincarnated rap from a past life 
 I drink a 40 of idiot then I grab Syze 
 For every hundred burners copped, Vinnie stash five 
 You asking for forgiveness? You should ask God 
 It's Vinnie P, I'm the biggest dog in the yard 
 It's Vinnie P, ain't no one could fuck with the god 
 It's Vinnie P, you should never fuck with the monster 
 It's Vinnie P, you crash like la-la-la-bamba 
 This is 45-caliber flow 
 Pound my chest like a gorilla so all the other savages know 
 I'm ravenous though 
 Jack you with the ratchet for dough 
 Marques de sade a painful sadomasochist flow 
 We tapping your ho, and keep the biscuit where I piss at 
 Pussy bwat bitches asking where this faggot dick at 
 I ain't never left the fucking crib without the gizzat 
 Ain't nobody above a homicide or a kidnap 
 If you got the army gear then you need the boots 
 If you talking about an army then you need the troops 
 It's all war over here I never seen the truce 
 I'm calling Maserati Mazi I don't mean the coupe 
 This here? This the duffle that I carry bones 
 Pistolvania most underrated since Larry Holmes 
 I run with a bunch of Ricans and they carry chrome 
 Here's a body bag to put the pussy that you carry home 
 It's Vinnie P, I'm the biggest dog in the yard 
 It's Vinnie P, ain't no one could fuck with the god 
 It's Vinnie P, you should never fuck with the monster 
 It's Vinnie P, you crash like la-la-la-bamba 
 It's Vinnie P, I'm the biggest dog in the yard 
 It's Vinnie P, ain't no one could fuck with the god 
 It's Vinnie P, you should never fuck with the monster 
 It's Vinnie P, you crash like la-la-la-bamba
