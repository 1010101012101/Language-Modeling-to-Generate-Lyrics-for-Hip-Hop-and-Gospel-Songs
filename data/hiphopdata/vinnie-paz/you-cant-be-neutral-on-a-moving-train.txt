Governments lie all the time 
 Well, not just the American government 
 It's just in the nature of governments 
 Well, they have to lie 
 And since they all represent the people 
 In some sense they act against the interest of the people 
 The only way they can hold power is if they lie to the people 
 (You don't know what I know, you can't see the spreading stain 
 Of deception, I am cruel to myself, things will never be the same) 
 If they told people the truth they wouldn't last very long 
 (I will hold my silence, like a weapon in my hand 
 If I used it, I would murder myself 
 You could never understand) 
 Columbus came ashore greeted with nothing but niceness 
 Sailing west in attempt to find gold and spices 
 Dominated by the popes in frenzy for ices 
 The Catholic church expelled Jews and claimed it was righteous 
 The first man to see land would get a reward 
 And get a yearly pension for life clearly from God 
 A young sailor saw land said, "We isn't far" 
 Columbus lies said he saw it the evening before 
 They touched ground, they were greeted by the 
 Columbus had them locked up as prisoners in an hour flat 
 He wanted to find their source of gold and that was that 
 And when they told that wasn't fair then he stabbed their back 
 When there's no more gold he took slaves instead 
 And left a quarter million Indians in Haiti dead 
 The men died in mines, the women died at work 
 The children died from lack of milk and they died in the dirt 
 They were just taking advantage of a passive people 
 They were just being the savages of massive evil 
 That's the church work, that's the path of 
 That's the blood of Abraham being stabbed by the steeple 
 In 1619 they were patiently waiting 
 For a ship that carried slaves who was changed in the nation 
 The white man was the cannibal praying to Satan 
 Hatred contempt a pity of patronization 
 That's the corner stone everything racism based in 
 The Africans had a more advanced civilization 
 Black was slave, master was white, rationalization 
 50 million dead, that's Western civilization 
 At first they appeared in the North 
 And they were helpless in the face of superior force 
 And all of them were chained together, they really was lost 
 Racism is a natural that's merely divorced 
 Before the slave trade blacks was considered distasteful 
 By the Oxford dictionary, I find it disgraceful 
 It's not a natural tendency to be bitter and hateful 
 It's the natural enemy of the critical stable 
 Slavery grew as the plantation system grew 
 The reason for that's kinda easily traceable 
 Society is was capable 
 Or saying, "Fuck a slave master, you're in slavery too" 
 Seven slaves was put to death for murdering master 
 ? Had them faster 
 You a killer, bastard 
 I will burn the white man while smelling the ashes 
 From time to time white man was part of the resistance 
 ? Wanted no part of the system 
 King Philip's war showed that if people would listen 
 That they can maybe break the complex chain of oppression 
 Tyranny is tyranny, but that's a concession 
 But the women they were treated like ???? 
 Black women had to work 'cause they was abused 
 That's the white justification of Aryan blues 
 The next move was to dominate the Mexicans 
 ? Dominate them like they was next of kin 
 ? And let them in 
 11 days later his skull was crushed, a message sent 
 We take nothing but conquest that was the mantra 
 The military wasn't human, they were just monsters 
 ? Refuse to pay his taxes 
 ? Locked in shackles 
 The twentieth century 
 Communism, Socialisim semmed to be rebirthed 
 War is the health of the state 
 The espionage 
 Supposedly 
 For printing 
 He was indicted, trialed and then found guilty 
 Had his freedom taking away by his own nation 
 Supposedly Kennedy tried to have that shit appealed 
 The post office
