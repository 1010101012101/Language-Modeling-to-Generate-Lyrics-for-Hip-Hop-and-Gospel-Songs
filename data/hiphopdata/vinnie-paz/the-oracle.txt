What I'ma hit you with 
 You motherfuckers better duck 
 I'm a bull in a china shop, watch how the uzi spit 
 Who we with, bros with hammers and they like too legit 
 I ain't got any time for your foolishness 
 Raw raps from the same place where the sits 
 He the mo'fucker always sippin' goose and shit 
 Stomp a rapper out, Timberland boots and shit 
 The left hand is what I give you the with 
 The right hand is where I write all of the ruthless shit 
 Survival of the fit or my little boozy shit 
 My hands are made of stone cut from that Madusa shit 
 Big gold chains, we was on that shit 
 Still roll with the kids I stole the Gucci with 
 I punch you dead in the face so fuck the music shit 
 The guns command though, Hollywood movie shit 
 Y'all aware y'all on some Lollapalooza shit 
 Let the beard grow 
 Y'all are scared when I step inside the booth and shit 
 Cuttin' mo'fuckers cell roll on some sushi shit 
 Y'all are cowards, y'all'll only talk on computer shit 
 This a Haitian ritual, I'm on my voodoo shit 
 Find out who's the realest (Vinnie) 
 Rock and not quit 
 What I'ma hit you with 
 You motherfuckers better duck 
 Death before dishonor, [?] blood y'all are fake 
 I let the 4.5 blocka blocka while I was [?] 
 Dead Sea overlook the view from inside a grave 
 The dictionary definition of dominate 
 Y'all weak Germantown 
 Fat bull, but my pockets never out of shape 
 You a bitch, security guard lock the gates 
 The Louis Vuitton bootleg, Prada fake 
 I'm tryin' to make the same money that Madonna make 
 Eyes never lie, I'm surprised that you not with 
 Rhymes and one tape, record an album in an hour's 
 You a pile of waste, I see a sucker and salivate 
 Cutting motherfuckers of, time to consolidate 
 A thousand pounds of weight'll force your heart to 
 It's Armageddon for you motherfuckers, lock the date 
 Any bitch I meet means that I'ma copulate 
 My revolution will be met with Peter Tosh's fate 
 That's the reason that the God is tryin' to populate 
 I can tell you how the Vodka taste 
 The 4.5 lift you, sent you into outer space
