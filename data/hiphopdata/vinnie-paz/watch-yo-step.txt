Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 My guns are bigger than a baby's arm 
 With Agent Orange like I was raised in 'Nam 
 The bullets stay inside your brain like it's your favourite song 
 I don't give a fuck who they hitting, they can graze your mom 
 I load the motherfucking clip in they like baby bombs 
 I see it as something beautiful when the metal fly 
 Around the way call me Lucifer, a hell of a guy 
 I'm a motherfucking veteran I'm telling you I'll 
 Beat his head until there's red in them I'm letting 'em die 
 City of brotherly thugs, the home of filthy living 
 You ain't fucking around with Vinnie, Perce, and Guilty Simpson 
 Unless you wanna be the target that we dump the clip in 
 I do the shit during the day, I like the gun to glisten 
 You a backwards motherfucker you run the prison 
 You think that being locked with males in jail a fun position 
 You should kill yourself rapper and be stuck in the earth 
 To be honest ain't no rapper that can fuck with you Perce 
 For the cats in the hood with a rep 
 Hustle through the AM when most men slept 
 In the waistline where the roscoe's kept 
 I'm on the edge nigga watch your step 
 I'm on the edge nigga watch your step 
 We here to eat till there's no food left 
 In the waistline where the roscoe's kept 
 I'm on the edge nigga watch your step 
 Verse 2 - Percee P: 
 Fast or slow pace my flow lace tracks this cat'll throw bass 
 And don't waste steps and go chase broads to no place 
 Master streets, impress the freaks, pimps dressed for weeks 
 Hoes left to me I guess to cheat and test the sheets 
 Ripping shows from here to Britain yo I'm hitting hoes 
 Skipping those women that spliff and blow are not getting dough 
 First degree murder rhymes disturbing mind like urban lies 
 And ? words signs ? Percee P 
 Amateurs know they can't stand with the bro 
 ? Cause damages most scandalous foes better handle it yo 
 I'm getting that ? till the whip in black 
 Spitting raps, hitting cats for kicking wack lyrics to bitten tracks 
 My interviews say I said a few lines to diminish crews 
 Some men'll do shit like bending rules 
 Go for the kill I'll still finish you 
 I'm so hot we gotta close shop, you know not to open your spot 
 While I patrol blocks you getting no rocks 
 Verse 3 - Guilty Simpson: 
 Guilty Simpson ? is beyond word descriptions 
 Rough verse inscriptions wrote by cutthroats 
 Smoke in the alley where the young cats bust toast 
 Pinching pennies to pay up his truck note 
 My various techniques compare with Jet Li 
 I'll chop with an AK and kick when it's pay day 
 Let's see how many men must test me 
 Deadly with a pen, let the rest beware 
 Face down in the playground six feet deep 
 In the sandbox when my right hand cocks 
 Back on the hammer you rest in peace 
 I play on wack cats when I bless the beats 
 Like priests in the Vatican he rattletattled and 
 Sprayed up the vehicle your homeboy travelled in 
 Fuck the spots they brag about 
 We kick your front door way in and drag 'em out
