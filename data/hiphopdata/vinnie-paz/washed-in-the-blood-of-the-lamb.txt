If you listen to me then you know my father was G 
 And the apple don't fall too far from the tree 
 Me and you is different as we could possibly be 
 Me and you is just different philosophically 
 I don't think it's anybody as obnoxious as me 
 I don't think that anybody else could parted the sea 
 I don't think that you wanna discuss the horror with me 
 If I was you I'd move a little bit more farther from me 
 It ain't nobody living more of a sergeant than me 
 It ain't nobody alive more of a prophet than me 
 It ain't nobody living possibly rocking with me 
 On the stage, in the studio, or boxing with me 
 Every second I'm awake there is a toxin in me 
 Anti-depressants, Suboxone, Oxycontin in me 
 Only a stupid motherfucker have a problem with me 
 'Cause he don't know I got the fucking problem-solver with me 
 I was washed in the blood of the lamb 
 Whoever touches my hand gonna leave enough blood in the sand 
 I was washed in the blood of the lamb 
 Whoever fuck with my fam suffering, a motherfucker should scram 
 I was washed in the blood of the lamb 
 Whoever touches my hand gonna leave enough blood in the sand 
 I was washed in the blood of the lamb 
 Whoever fuck with my fam suffering, a motherfucker should scram 
 I slaughter anything I get my hands on 
 Inside the Church of Anton with bloody pants on 
 I was in the land of Israel and heard ram's horn 
 I was in the sand with Ishmael and fought the sandstorm 
 I'm just waiting for the raven to thaw 
 'Cause I don't argue with Mesopotamian law 
 I submit my will and faith into the grace of Allah 
 And the Mayan calendar say it's erasing us all 
 The four-fifth you should see this thing, it's berserk 
 And y'all are royalty inside a fucking kingdom of dirt 
 How are y'all original when y'all ain't think of it first? 
 I just wish I could put everything I think into verse 
 But instead I decide to drink in a Russian bar 
 I'm Rasputin, I'm influencing a Russian Tsar 
 I'm Dave Lombardo on drums, leave the percussion scarred 
 I drink the bottle to the bottom, put my trust in God
