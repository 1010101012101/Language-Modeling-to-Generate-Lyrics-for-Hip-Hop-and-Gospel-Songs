Im running around the globe havin' the time of my life 
 Its no others it's my brothers and we shine every night 
 I ain't makin' any moves unless the timin is right 
 And my objective is to have my mother shining in ice 
 I roll 4 5 6 on the grind with the dice 
 And just stay away from Vinnie that's my kindest advice 
 I Mike Tys verse big lord I'm dyin' to fight 
 I drink drugs smoke alcohol my mind isn't right 
 Eternal sunsine of the spot I'm just mindin my site 
 I knock buildings over like I was Osama on flights 
 I would dream about jordans I would die for the nikes 
 We ain't had the money but my mother buy me the nikes 
 You see I'm mean real mean like how Gandhi was nice 
 I hustle hard real hard with the china that's white 
 I don't fuck with y'all, you simply garbage on mics 
 I would kill myself pray give my father his life 
 See I was born in the killin' fields 
 It took me a while to manifest how I really feel 
 I'm from Philly automatically a bigger deal 
 I was always with a Lench Mob Chilly Chill 
 See, it's a brand new funk that was really will 
 I love rap it's always been my Achilles' heel 
 Merkin another rapper well that's a silly kill 
 I just tell the pussy back off really chill 
 I live in gun land, home in 9 milly vill 
 And I'm a Pun fan greatest rapper really ill 
 I don't judge music, whatever you feel you feel 
 I make drug music, whatever I deal I deal 
 Smoke L's and wakata I will a really build 
 I got a brother that's a g he will really pill 
 I'm an ape, I'm a monkey, I'm guerilla-willed 
 I got hate, I'm a junkie, I'm a killers thrill
