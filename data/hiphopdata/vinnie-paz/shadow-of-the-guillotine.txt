I have heard the young men of Judah 
 They acknowledge me king 
 As for you, you thought my father's yoke was heavy, wait until you feel mine 
 You thought my father's taxes too high 
 Mine will crush you 
 How dare you speak out against your lawful king? 
 My father chastised you with whips 
 I shall use scorpions! 
 I am your king! 
 I stand on top of the mountain, I was a born rapper 
 The house of the Holy Spirit, another long chapter 
 Untouched glory of God, a strong factor 
 The nine laws were bound together from salms after 
 The Smith & Wesson rubber grip made my palm blacker 
 You're not a MC, pussy, you're a reformed actor 
 Your whole fam is fucked up 
 The chemical wedding of Christ where the gods gather 
 The weapon of the dead gods was a thorn dagger 
 Every verse, every in the Qu'ran has a 
 'Nother scripcture, another picture was drawn blacker 
 Arabize curtis legacy, the storm catcher 
 The fucking MC you don't wanna perform after 
 The seventh son of the seventh son of his law passer 
 Mercy prevail over wrath from Imam ladder 
 16 bars similar to God's rapture 
 They tried to stop me at every level and stress me and send me devils 
 I press 'em like Chevy pedals and shred 'em like heavy metal 
 Whenever for a minute of the spotlight 
 Your raps is a 
 I caught some spitting shots to your brain cell 
 So you and George Zimmerman can rot in the same hell 
 Capital cue, stand at odds with the metal ready 
 And level the playing field with the God of the Serengeti 
 Keep your enemies close enough to never fall 
 The victim of a death plot, keep afar and get shot 
 Decapitated heads drop and fall down a flight of stairs 
 Like Apocalypto sacrifices, I wrap the stack prices 
 Like Apple Mac devices, it's real brutal 
 And got that rock steady seal of approval 
 I pray to the heavens, he pray to the east 
 And on the Sunday San Gennaro we parade to the feast, minkya!
