Some people wake up late, I wake up mad late 
 All the time hungover, it's a sad state 
 I love liquor, she my bitch and her ass great 
 But I don't remember anything from our last date 
 I wipe the sleep from my eyes and I peep my phone 
 Twenty texts, thirty calls, just leave me alone 
 My head pounding like crazy, I need some Patron 
 That's the hair of the dog, god need a bone 
 Kiss my mama on the cheek, she look beautiful 
 (Vinnie you're a mess, what I'm gonna do with you?) 
 I know you cooking something 
 (Yeah, I made some food for you 
 Managut, bragol, and some brigutte too) 
 I told you wild times ma I don't fuck with pork 
 Please pass the lucatelli and a bunch of salt 
 The phone ring, it's the police but who would've thought? 
 This motherfucking pig telling me I'm due in court 
 Every time I feel this shit is going my way 
 Something come along and fuck up my day 
 I had a rhyme in my mind now there's nothing to say 
 And cousin that just fucked up my day 
 Driving down the block someone cut in my way 
 That shit went and fucked up my day 
 Rap critics, they always got something to say 
 I would never let that fuck up my day 
 I don't know where the fuck I'm at today 
 I drank a couple of bottles, I guess I have to pay 
 This bitch laying next me, she look like Cassius Clay 
 Gotta get outta here before she asks me to stay 
 I don't know how I got here in the first place 
 She had a banging body but she had the worst face 
 I guess I act like an animal, I deserve hate 
 She must've lured me in with white like she was third base 
 It ain't hard to convince me to do some dumb shit 
 Especially when I'm on that get high and drunk shit 
 That's why Vinnie always end up with a dumb bitch 
 The only thing I'm never on is on some punk shit 
 I'm on the other side of town and I'm walking dolo 
 Panerai watch, Gucci kicks, lots of Polo 
 Goons ran up on the kid, put the gat to my dome 
 I was caught slipping, I left the ratchet at home
