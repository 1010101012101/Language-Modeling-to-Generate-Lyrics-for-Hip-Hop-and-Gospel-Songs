Any time I pull the hammer out, it's usually Glock 
 It's usually cocked, it's usually for shooting at cops 
 I'd like to say I'm sober, but I'm usually not 
 Usually at the bar with bitches, they salute me a lot 
 And they like to argue whether they a groupie or not 
 Tell me that they intellectual and school me a lot 
 Listen bitch, I ain't sayin' if you stupid or not 
 You just barkin' up the wrong tree, move it or stop 
 I was reading Nabokov, while you was groovin' to pop 
 I was selling nickel bags and was a student of Pac 
 I was watching Kubrick movies, I was shootin' a lot 
 Had to lie to my mama, wasn't truthful a lot 
 You was stupid, thought a Bud deuce-deuce was a lot 
 And I never thought a whole bottle of Goose was a lot 
 You decide if I'm drunk or that I'm lucid or not 
 I just know that I'm smarter than you, and the proof in the pot?)
