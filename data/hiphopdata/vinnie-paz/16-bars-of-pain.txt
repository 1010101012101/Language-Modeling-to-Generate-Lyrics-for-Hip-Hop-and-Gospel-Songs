Verse 1 - Vinnie Paz: 
 My guns are bigger than a baby's arm 
 With Agent Orange like I was raised in 'Nam 
 The bullets stay inside your brain like it's your favorite song 
 I don't give a fuck who they hitting, they can graze your mom 
 I load the motherfucking clip in they like baby bombs 
 I see it as something beautiful when the metal fly 
 Around the way call me Lucifer, a hell of a guy 
 I'm a motherfucking veteran I'm telling you I'll 
 Beat his head until there's red in them I'm letting 'em die 
 City of brotherly thugs, the home of filthy living 
 You ain't fucking around with Vinnie, Perce, and Guilty Simpson 
 Unless you wanna be the target that we dump the clip in 
 I do the shit during the day, I like the gun to glisten 
 You a backwards motherfucker you run the prison 
 You think that being locked with males in jail a fun position 
 You should kill yourself rapper and be stuck in the earth 
 To be honest ain't no rapper that can fuck with you Perce 
 For the cats in the hood with a rep 
 Hustle through the AM when most men slept 
 In the waistline where the roscoe's kept 
 I'm on the edge nigga watch your step 
 I'm on the edge nigga watch your step 
 We here to eat till there's no food left 
 In the waistline where the roscoe's kept 
 I'm on the edge nigga watch your step
