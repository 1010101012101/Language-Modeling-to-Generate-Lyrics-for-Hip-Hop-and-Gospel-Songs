(Whispers) 
 I'm living on my last breath 
 Hit a fork in the road 
 And the devil occupies both lanes 
 Stumble as I back step 
 Feel the pressure on my soul as the air's leaving out my frame 
 Now breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe 
 I'm living on my last breath 
 It's all final when it's final when you fade into a blacked-out dream 
 (Chris Rivers) 
 Until my last breath 
 I hope my heart's been fully accessed 
 Pass this to my regrets: 
 "I hope you're all in past tense" 
 Married a girl with accent 
 Carried this world's axis 
 Make some major changes and some statements till I'm ashes 
 And placed in hourglasses 
 So you could turn me upside down and watch as time passes 
 Drugs are bad habits, Before I'm in that casket 
 And that happiness I'm searching for, I hope I grasp it. 
 I hope I fully grab it and never take for granted 
 All the luxury things in life; and still believe in magic 
 Look back on all my fans and know I made them track hits 
 And I hope I never look for love, I hope that it just happens 
 And if I have kids I hope that it was stressful 
 But worth it in the end because they all became successful 
 And I hope my last breath was something truly breathful 
 But worse, I could've said much more before I died and left you 
 (Vinnie Paz) 
 Until my last breath 
 I'll have death before dishonour 
 I welcome drama 
 With open arms and holding a llama 
 My whole persona is vodka bottles and marijuana 
 The hope in Nana was rocking, inspired from my momma 
 I'm a warrior, I went into jail for the drama 
 I'm the story of the terrorist cell of Osama 
 I wanna never have birth and fail as a father 
 I would never want the illness that killed in my nana 
 The half-moon on the bank of the river's devotion 
 That's the stab wound born from the killer emotion 
 I was enraged by darkness, militant motion 
 I was embraced by the thought of distilling the ocean 
 I would never question the power of God' pain 
 Until I saw his body; the colour of dark rain 
 He recited the third chapter, Allah name 
 And he ignited the third chapter, Allah flame
