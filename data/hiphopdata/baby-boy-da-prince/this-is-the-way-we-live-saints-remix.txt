 The Saints comin' back

 Katrina couldn't stop us New Orleans 
 A number 1 playin' (Sean Payton) 
 This is the way we live 
 New Orlean Saints number 1 on the field 
 Katrina couldn't stop us and that's real 
 Beatin' these teams its no big deal big deal big 
 This is the way we live 
 New Orlean Saints number 1 on the field 
 Katrina couldn't stop us and that's real 
 Beatin' these teams its no big deal big deal big

 I said who is they sayin' they goin' to beat them saints 
 U can't do that then you can't beat them saints 
 We got players like Reggie Bush and Duece mac 
 Offensive line just push them to the back 
 Defensive line just blitz them get a sack 
 Drew Brees got arm man throw it to the mac 
 Joe Horn goin' long Touchdown that's a fact 
 The best team in the league whatch you no bout that 
 A we the saints and we go all the way 
 A we the saints and win hard today 
 Charles Grant a monster how he bust through the line 
 Teams better beware when they see the saints eye 
 This is the way we live 
 New Orlean Saints number 1 on the field 
 Katrina couldn't stop us and that's real 
 Beatin' these teams its no big deal big deal big 
 This is the way we live 
 New Orlean Saints number 1 on the field 
 Katrina couldn't stop us and that's real 
 Beatin' these teams its no big deal big deal big 
 This is the way we live 
 I I's it's the saints we go all the way 
 Katrina couldn't stop us and we here to stay 
 At home in the dome and we ready to play 
 Undefeated in the league that is all I gotta say 
 Now who let the dogs out must be Sean P. 
 Straight to the endzone we eleven deep 
 Then comes carney with a field goal 
 Now the saints on the way to the super bowl 
 This is the way we live 
 New Orlean Saints number 1 on the field 
 Katrina couldn't stop us and that's real 
 Beatin' these teams its no big deal big deal big 
 This is the way we live 
 New Orlean Saints number 1 on the field 
 Katrina couldn't stop us and that's real 
 Beatin' these teams its no big deal big deal big 
 This is the way we live
