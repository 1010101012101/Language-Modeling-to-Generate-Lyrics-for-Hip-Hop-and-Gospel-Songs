(Feat. nina sky) 
 Baby boy, nina sky 
 Baby boy, nina sky 
 They don't know how you make me feel 
 And they don't know what you do to me 
 Just nobody has to know, nobody has to know 
 Look, they don't really know 'bout the things I do 
 And they don't really know 'bout the pain we go through 
 So I shot down everything and I gotta let you know 
 This industry shit hard and it ain't no joke 
 Paparazzi in my face, paparazzi in my hair 
 Paparazzi over here, paparazzi over there 
 But I don't care 'cause I'm always on time 
 Right up in the game, now I finally got the limelight 
 Sexy rock star and she's pretty like a mutha, man 
 Ill crack up if she leave me for another man 
 Yeah, you know I'm real and, yeah, you know the deal 
 I just gotta let you know how you really make me feel 
 They don't know how you make me feel 
 And they don't know what you do to me 
 Just nobody has to know, nobody has to know 
 I be happy every time I hug my girl 
 I be happy every time I rub my girl 
 And I love her so much, id give her the world 
 The moon, the sun, and the stars up above 
 Our love, man, is so outrageous 
 Our trust, man, is so amazing 
 Dusgustin' never my baby 
 Fussin', no, not lately 
 Everytime I'm with my girl, man it drives me crazy 
 I try not to lie 'cause I don't want her to hate me 
 I gotta keep it real, I gotta keep it trill 
 If I didn't do this shit this wouldn't be the way I live 
 'Cause I can get you off my mind, boy 
 I'm grateful everyday that you're mine 
 Tried lovin' but I could not find the one 
 But lovin' you has taken me high 
 They don't know how you make me feel 
 And they don't know what you do to me 
 Just nobody has to know, nobody has to know 
 They don't know how you make me feel 
 And they don't know what you do to me 
 Just nobody has to know, nobody has to know
