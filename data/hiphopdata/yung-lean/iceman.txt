When I'm in your, uh 
 When I'm in your town, see me gone off the ice, man 
 Jugg with the right hand, clean wrist, sprite, man 
 Look like Tyson, rich like Mike, man 
 Bitch, I'm fried, man, six rings, Iceland 
 She gone and flipping the dough 
 She sprung, she stuck on the floor 
 Her eyes, they were low 
 Stacks all on my floor 
 She don't want nothing but dro 
 Back in the whip and let's go 
 I get the cash and I go 
 Your love was all on my phone, Lean 
 When I'm in your town, see me gone off that ice, man 
 Jugg with the right hand, clean wrist, sprite, man 
 Look like Tyson, rich like Mike, man 
 Bitch I don't like man, six rings, Iceland 
 When I'm in your town, I got bags of the stacks and 
 Frost on the cake, man, big time sticks and 
 Work with the left hand, chains on tin France 
 Look like ice and you small-time miceman 
 I go and switch up my flow 
 Drugs all on the stove 
 Bags filled with the blow 
 Leaves falling down slow 
 I pick the frost then I'm froze 
 No new friends and no new clones 
 Living on stage, I'm alone 
 Flipping and tripping my walls 
 Your love was all on my phone 
 Still posted up by the stove 
 Stacks and lean my cologne 
 Dropping and picking up dough 
 Your love was all on my phone 
 Stacks and lean my cologne 
 Dropping and picking up dough 
 Still posted up by the stove 
 When I'm in your town, see me gone off the ice, man 
 Jugg with the right hand, clean wrist, sprite, man 
 Look like Tyson, rich like Mike, man 
 Bitch, I'm fried, man, six rings, Iceland 
 She gone and flipping the dough 
 She sprung, she stuck on the floor 
 Her eyes, they were low 
 Stacks all on my floor 
 She don't want nothing but dro 
 Back in the whip and let's go 
 I get the cash and I go 
 Your love was all on my phone, Lean
