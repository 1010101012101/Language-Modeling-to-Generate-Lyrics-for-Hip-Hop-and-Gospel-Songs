Shawty, you know what it do 
 Wrist links when I come through 
 I finna take 'em to the moon 
 I fly up like a balloon 
 All white linen, paint it true 
 Shawty, you know what it do 
 Smokin' double, give me two 
 Shawty, you know what it do 
 I don't give no fucks 'bout you 
 I take it all, can never lose 
 Only myself for my trues 
 Balmain on shit since I was two 
 Got helicopters on my roof 
 I'm hiding far away from you 
 Sad Mob, we don't fuck wit fools 
 I need a (?) big grey goose 
 Double Gs on my shoe 
 Gs on my shoes 
 Shawty, you know what it do 
 Wrist links when I come through 
 I finna take 'em to the moon 
 I fly up like a balloon 
 All white linen, paint it true 
 Shawty, you know what it do
