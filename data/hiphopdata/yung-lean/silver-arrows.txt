Sapphire, diamonds, iced out, want my money right now 
 Cashing out, I'm cashed out, hit you in the chest now 
 Silver arrows my sound, fuck them all I might die 
 I be up on cloud nine, green laces, smoke clouds 
 All my boys with me we hop out the rental (rental) 
 She licking my scars 
 She go down, I was mental 
 At the psych ward, couldn't finish my sentence 
 Looked in the mirror, I was full of vengeance 
 Yellow Hummer, give a fuck about anything 
 The fan fuck you over on everything 
 Jugging forever, now I want the Bentley, man 
 Trapped in the spirit, I can't see the ending, man 
 Silk dreams, light works, I don't care if they call now 
 Mist fiends, glowworms, I'm just trying to ball out 
 Feet of mars, Hollister bags in the mall now 
 Gotta pick myself up, I don't care if I fall out 
 Sapphire, diamonds, iced out, want my money right now 
 Cashing out, I'm cashed out, hit you in the chest now 
 Silver arrows my sound, fuck them all I might die 
 I be up on cloud nine, Green laces, smoke clouds 
 Was a little stoner, my eyes were so reddy man 
 Fuck is he doing? My whole crew be ready man 
 Never realised I would hop out in Chevy, man 
 Ecstasy fine, but my Giuseppe stepping man 
 14 in the club when I'm popping them pills and them 
 Thaiboy, he told me go ahead and stunt on them 
 Don't like piggies, go ahead I should blown on them 
 Demons in my head now I am well at least 
 Three stripes, three heavens and I want plenty keys 
 My girl was mine 'cause I was on Fendi 
 They just popped a flat I got like ten with me 
 Walking through the fire 
 Sapphire, diamonds, iced out, want my money right now 
 Cashing out, I'm cashed out, hit you in the chest now 
 Silver arrows my sound, fuck them all I might die 
 I be up on cloud nine, green laces, smoke clouds
