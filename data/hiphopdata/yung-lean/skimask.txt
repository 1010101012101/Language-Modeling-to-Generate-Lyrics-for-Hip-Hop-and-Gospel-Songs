I got lots of swag and I be feeling hurt 
 Walk up in the bank like John Dillinger 
 Rainbows I'm willing to splurge 
 After you've gone I'm still on the Earth 
 No, no, no you can't get my bank roll 
 Slow, slow, slow this cup got me slow 
 Low, low, low shawty bring it to the floor (get low) 
 Oh, oh, oh SBE in this bitch got more (Sad Boys) 
 Ski Mask, shawty, girl, whatever you like (you like) 
 Moncler jackets dirty cash plenty flights (flights) 
 Cocaine clean but my jeans really dirty 
 I just copped some silver rings and they go about Thirty 
 Ski mask, shawty I pull up with the team (pull up, pull up) 
 Ski mask, shawty I still see you in my dreams (Lean!) 
 Dirty fanta shawty bitch I'll never leave (l'll never leave) 
 Dirty fanta shawty bitch I'll never leave (Scrr, scrr) 
 Flow, flow, flow on the floor, floor, floor 
 Percs, percs, percs, got me out of control 
 Iced-out on the floor rubber bands can't even fold 
 Girls all in my phone ho ho Santa Clause 
 Ski mask shawty praying down to my knees 
 Louis Sprite Gang shawty all over me 
 Check out my waist and check out my sleeves 
 When I ride around I keep my stacks on my feet 
 Ski mask shawty keep the racks for the team 
 Ten toes down in my head I'm not clean 
 Reality for me I don't see it like you see 
 Broken Piano, pockets stuffed with magic beans 
 Walk up in the club, I got like fifty birds (Walk up, Walk up) 
 (?) on my I'm still on the search 
 I got straight hunneds straight drop 
 Love of my life she gonna set me up 
 Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up in the parking lot 
 Bitch we selling Wine and I'm breaking rocks 
 Just keep going I don't wanna stop 
 Pull up, pull up in the parking lot 
 Dough, dough, dough, I got dough, dough, dough 
 More like Bart Simpson in my song, song, song 
 Clone, clone, clone, you a clone, clone, clone 
 All so low Imma hop on the road 
 Ski Mask shawty got whatever you like 
 Moncler jackets dirty cash plenty flights 
 Cocaine clean but my jeans really dirty 
 I just copped some silver rings and they go about Thirty 
 Ski Mask, shawty I pull up with the team (pull up, pull up) 
 Ski Mask, shawty I still see you in my dreams (out of control) 
 Dirty fanta, shawty bitch I'll leave 
 Dirty fanta, shawty bitch I'll never leave
