43XL on my baggy tee 
 Freddy G and scars on my shoulders see 
 Wannabe, they all look like some wannabes 
 Imma leave every leaf that grows after me 
 Come and see bitch we deep, human centipede 
 On my feet, there's no e's, see no enemies 
 Kilo green, speak my heart till I rest in peace 
 All I see, road warriors, eternal sleep 
 Imma leave everything for my family 
 Gotta go hard for myself, I look after me 
 20 e's, double g, never fall asleep 
 Eyes on sight, ancient whispers they still follow me 
 My ride ain't got no ceiling 
 My teeth ain't got no fillings 
 My wallet stuffed with dead people, ain't no livin' 
 My eyes ain't got no feelings 
 My grandma said she feel me (she do!) 
 Ghosts in the street, still alive but not livin' 
 I'm tryna stack a milli, chain on stupid silly (chain) 
 Feel like Elvis Presley, Lean just left the building 
 My boys right here with me, mystery still in it 
 Never switch up, got metallic intuition 
 My ride ain't got no ceiling 
 My teeth ain't got no fillings 
 My wallet stuffed with dead people, ain't no livin' 
 My eyes ain't got no feelings 
 My grandma said she feel me (she do!) 
 Ghosts in the street still alive but not livin' 
 I'm tryna stack a milli, chain on stupid silly (bling, blaow) 
 Feel like Elvis Presley, Lean just left the building 
 My boys right here with me, mystery still in it 
 Never switch up, got metallic intuition 
 Never switch up, you just mind your business 
 Imma find you where I found my chemist 
 Slide to the back then I ride my Bentley 
 Percocet at time blow 'em up like Kenny 
 Passions all on wine, my cup half empty 
 Trying to rewind but I slip myself in (leandoer) 
 The world down with me, I snuck myself in 
 Trying to rewind but I slip myself in 
 40 in the building, chains in the ceiling 
 I don't really care, got metallic intuition 
 Give a fuck about the system 
 Narnia gave me wisdom 
 Keys to my mind, angels are my rhythm 
 Riding past, solo on an avenue 
 Grapes of wrath 
 No one ever told me what to do 
 Imma spaz, damage, yeah, I'm damaged you 
 She my half, ballerina so I'll fill the room 
 My teeth ain't got no feelings 
 My ride ain't got no ceiling 
 My wallet stuffed with dead people 
 My teeth ain't got no feelings 
 My ride ain't got no ceiling 
 My wallet stuffed with dead people 
 Lean 
 All the way from Narnia is back man 
 Leandoer, man 
 Gud, me and Sherman, all of that, Sadboys to infinity 
 World ain't got no feelings but my (?) from my ceiling 
 My ride ain't got no ceiling, you know how this shit goes 
 Shout out my grandma, shout out my family, shout out 43XL
