Listening to my favourite 80s cut 
 Like Stevie Nicks doing cocaine up her butt 
 Listening to my favourite 80s cut 
 Like Stevie Nicks doing cocaine up her butt 
 Sent to Earth to prevent the birth 
 Of the search of Yung Lean AKA the new Big Lurch 
 Fucking hoes heads like I'm Papa Smurf 
 I'm on the ocean perch I'm finna break it up on church 
 I'm so high I'm posted up finna leave Earth 
 See me posted on my back porch, catch me posted in my black Porsche 
 Roll up a blunt and light it 
 I'm Leandoer 
 That lean's got me swerving, Yung Lean? serving hits 
 Right up on the table like Thanksgiving turkey and gravy 
 Born dead after serving females legs in my shed during classes 
 Black magic bitch, call me Merlin?? 8 pounds sterling 
 I'm following the same certain whirling 
 I'm getting 8 pounds sterling 
 I'm following the same certain whirling 
 Getting 8 pounds sterling 
 Put the key in and open the door, find Leandoer 
 Looking in the orgy like voyeur 
 Fuck Jack and the beanstalk, I'm climbing up on this great wall 
 It's all white like Snow White 
 If the coke's right then I don't need to fight 
 If the coke's right then I don't need to fight 
 If the coke's right then I don't need to fight
