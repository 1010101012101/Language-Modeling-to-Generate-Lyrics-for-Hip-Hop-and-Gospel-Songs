We rollin' 'round, 
 Segway scooters 
 Shooting Lasers, 
 Bring you down 
 Gotta grind everyday, 
 Like get the fucking money now 
 All these bitches tryna hold me down 
 Demons in the wind, 
 I'll be puffing on clouds 
 We rollin' 'round, 
 Segway scooters 
 Shooting Lasers, 
 Bring you down 
 Gotta grind everyday, 
 Like get the fucking money now 
 All these bitches tryna hold me down

 With some work, count it like you've never heard 
 With my money take you from the earth 
 Watch me do, all I do is splurge 
 Doing what I choose, all I do is splurge 
 Yeah I'm still numbing nigga's earth 
 Thaiboy, Thaiboy, swag, do all the work (all the work) 
 Thaiboy, Thaiboy, cash doing all the earth (all the earth) 
 Thaiboy, I don't lie, still far from perfect

 I'm on top of the earth with Darth Vader snorting blow 
 If you tell me do that, I'll probably say no 
 Six brothers got attached to me forever ago 
 It's whatever, live forever 
 So I pour it up slow 
 I got the best of [?] shit, breaking bottles in the snow 
 Euros, hundreds, hundreds, ice, diamonds, sipping Coke though 
 Sixties, fifties, spend them so I can't see no evil spirits 
 Bitch I've been blessed
