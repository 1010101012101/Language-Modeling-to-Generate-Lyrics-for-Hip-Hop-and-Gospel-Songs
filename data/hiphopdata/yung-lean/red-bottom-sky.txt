 Ice dropping, red bottom sky 
 Intrigued by the moment, look like she know why 
 Ice dropping, red bottom sky 
 Ice on my feet, I keep slipping (slipping away) 
 Ice dropping, red bottom sky 
 Intrigued by the moment, look like she know why 
 Ice dropping, red bottom sky 
 Ice on my feet, I keep slipping (slipping away) 
 Soldiers in the night and we lurking 
 Medieval flowers in my church, we working 
 I'm in the bottom, let's be silver surfer surfing 
 I lived a thousand lives, but I'm still searching (where they at?) 
 Broken glass in my hands, sister's twerking 
 Money on the floor and she nervous 
 Paint a picture like Van Gogh, I'm cursed man 
 Skrrt skrrt to the moon, bitch, I'm swerving (skrrt) 
 Hit the curve and my shit is hurting 
 I was down, so deep down but time's turning (darkness on my) 
 Darkness in my mind, flip the mattress, I got dough 
 Harvest on my line, I live the story I was told 
 Ice dropping, red bottom sky 
 Intrigued by the moment, look like she know why

 I heard shooters on the roof, yeah they're trynna shoot you 
 I'm in a dark room, candles singing hallelujah 
 You think I'm gone too much, well, I think I suit you 
 You say I'm in my mind too much, well, I know that suits you 
 I lost everything, only thing I'm scared is to lose you 
 I heard voices in my head, yeah, they whispered to us 
 Paranoid, sledgehammer, that's my Ruger 
 Woke up, realized I had to move up 
 Worked myself away everyday, now my loot up 
 But the truth is, I wish I never knew us 
 God of violence, pink dreams in my two cup 
 I've told you this was gonna end, but I fooled you

 Ice dropping, red bottom sky 
 Ice on my feet, I keep slipping 
 Feels like I'm walking on water, not wine 
 Cut off my fingers to touch your smile
