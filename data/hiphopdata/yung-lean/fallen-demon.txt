I'm addicted to the feeling, I can't get it out 
 I feel sick into the ceiling, hurt to see my life 
 I go in for my sesh, shawty, get it wet 
 So many fires in my grave, feels like on a jet 
 So many engines, like my diamonds need a serviette 
 They didn't let me out for three weeks 
 Feel like a vet 
 I'm addicted to the feeling, I can't get it out 
 I feel sick into the celling, hurt to see my life 
 Woodgrain dripping, finger licking, polo dime 
 Cider sippin', slide the coupe and switch it out 
 Stockholm city, dungeon with me 
 We doin' dirt, blowing smoke 
 Countin' bands on the low 
 Smokin' earth 'round the globe 
 With the team from the snow 
 Doin' dirt, blowing smoke 
 Countin' bands on the low 
 Smokin' earth 'round the globe 
 With the team from the snow 
 Draped in fur like a bird 
 I got gold 'round my toes 
 Doin' dirt, Gucci skirt 
 Shawty down where I go 
 Woodgrain gripping henney sippin 
 Vodka redbull eating chicken 
 Say we wicked like the witches 
 I got love for all my bitches (Lean) 
 And I got love for all my bitches 
 I'm addicted to the feeling, I can't get it out 
 I feel sick into the celling, hurt to see my life 
 I go in for my sesh, shawty, get it wet 
 So many fires in my grave, feels like I'm on a jet 
 So many engines, like my diamonds need a serviette 
 They didn't let me out for three weeks 
 Feel like a vet 
 They didn't let me out for three weeks 
 I feel like a vet 
 I got fire down I'm burnin running throught my vest 
 Ice, woke, neon diamonds 
 Get it faster with my guidance 
 Hell, lose, snow alliance 
 Love comes first, hate comes silent 
 No hate just faith 
 Live my life through ultra violence 
 Big gates pearly snakes 
 Yeah, they sneak up, up behind me, yellow lie 
 Rhinestone with my team, we won't come lightly, slightly done 
 She bite it up 
 Big Hummer big yellow trucks 
 Falling demon through my guts 
 Feel my lungs, they giving up 
 Yellow lie 'cause yellow ducks 
 Big alligator catching bucks 
 Gave up on me, don't give a fuck 
 I come through and slice you up
