Sandman, CEO 
 SBE, cash man 
 Damn man, Shawty got it back with her last man 
 Fat pants, big diamonds, sipping jasmine 
 Roll up to the mountain and I'm dripping all black man 
 True friends only roll with true friends 
 Green tea, straight out the tin can 
 Think man, reminisce on what has, has been, hash man 
 Throw my conscious in the trash can, trash man 
 That is what they said I'd be, it has been a good year 
 It is time to raise the glass man 
 Cops man, fuck the police, let them blast them down 
 Fact then, all my money fattens 
 What the hell happened Fish tail salmon 
 Hop on the bandwagon 
 All I do is golden, work more then Safran 
 Plasma, on my TV plasma 
 Patterns, you can see the patterns in my passion 
 Only roll campaigns 
 Wonderland, I'm in Wonderland like I'm Alice 
 My palace, is going to fast, let me fasten seat belt 
 Loui V, can you imagine 
 MDMA, no Montana 
 Let me bring this back to land man 
 Abandon, leave you abandoned 
 Fuck with me and you know we leave you abandoned 
 Let me bring this back to land man 
 It has been a good year, bitch it's time to raise the raise the glass man
