Sad Boys be the set 
 Catch me in a jet 
 Getting head with a mermaid on deck 
 Sad Boys be the set 
 Catch me in a jet 
 Getting head with a mermaid on deck 
 I got the Casio, she got the G-Shock 
 We on the same watch 
 We on the same watch 
 Wheels on my Bentley keep turning 
 Wheels of justice keeps turning (turning) 
 I pull up in a Chevy 
 Chain be super heavy 
 Chopper to my head-I think I'm ready 
 Come through in the castle bitch 
 I'm King Koopa sneaking around 
 Like an insect small hairless 
 Looper bust off with this sniper store 
 I'm in, like a stormtrooper 
 Check the front, like it's snooper 
 Made a lot of mixtapes brain fell forward 
 Like a TV blooper

 Wheels on my Bentley keep turning 
 Wheels of justice keeps turning (turning) 
 And I can't walk back 
 Fuck and we all that 
 Fuck and we all that 
 Uh, posted up in the airport 
 Big Jet, with a couple midgets 
 Sip lean off the triple head 
 That bed head slept to the (?) 
 I make plenty of bread (?) stacks 
 I'm plenty of racks 
 Caked up 'cause I'm finna mack 
 I'm in a cab, swerving on this acid 
 Looney Tunes tab gooey newsman 
 Louis Shoes-man 
 World's turning and I grew up too fast 
 Posted in the street 
 Holler at your boy 
 Posted red Gucci on my feet 
 Holler at your boy 
 Aquarium three headed fish on the beat 
 Holler at your boy 
 Holler at your boy 
 Swagger on my asshole

 Sad Boys, Yung Sherman, Yung Gud 
 Shawty Yung Lean Doer 
 What you up to tonight?
