Yung Leandoer, ' 
 Sad Boys 
 Up in this bitch until infinity 
 Salute to the gang, know where we hang 
 Bitches 'round the yard they follow me like Pacman 
 Salute to the fans, sold my brain gland 
 Kit Kat Lick on my hip she got a chance 
 Shawty wanna bang, she look just like a fan 
 Snorting in the bathroom, paranoia with my man's 
 Salute to the gang, know where we hang 
 Girls all around the yard they follow me like Pacman 
 Got my cup dirty, like I never poured it up 
 Riding through the city with no ceiling, ain't no looking up 
 She just want to tease it, I was leanin', they looking like us 
 Touched by the moment, feeling myself, Imma cut you off 
 Stacks on wrist, graveyard wish 
 Opening my eyes like I ain't never lived 
 You know who I'm with, ten-million hits 
 Put me on your song, I got killer instincts 
 Ice on slick, Rick Owens on my bitch 
 Avenger in the night, I be cruising grand whips 
 Slayers stacks like the mayor 
 Pager, she gon' hit me on my pager 
 Later, gon' get it now or later 
 All I want is to get rich, buy a house and some laser 
 Salute to the gang, know where we hang 
 Bitches 'round the yard they follow me like Pacman 
 Salute to the fans, sold my brain gland 
 Kit Kat lick on my hip she got a chance 
 Shawty wanna bang, she look like just a fan 
 Snorting in the bathroom, paranoia with my man's 
 Salute to the gang, know where we hang 
 Girls all around the yard they follow me like Pacman 
 I'm a guardian of the moon, white silver withtattoos 
 We gon' hotbox in the coupe, platonic mind, twilight, two moons 
 I don't give a fuck, I told you, Silver Surfer soldiers 
 Went to war, it's over, like my cash, my mind got older 
 I'm wearing my Timberlands, eating on marmalade 
 Living in vain, I put sparks in a starter brain 
 Hop out with ice, and I look like a target train 
 Icy blue veins keep it real, 'cause the market fake 
 I'm on a mountain, I pour me a double seal 
 And I need medicine, pour me a benzopan' 
 Warlord, but I'm not a cyborg, I'm almost real 
 Salute to the gang, we can get it 
 I know we will 
 I know some people that ain't rocking with me no more 
 Triple six, resist and pass out during shows for 
 Hard feelings start to grow when there's no more 
 No more 
 Salute to the gang, know where we hang 
 Bitches 'round the yard they follow me like Pacman 
 Salute to the fans, sold my brain gland 
 Kit Kat lick on my hip she got a chance 
 Shawty wanna bang, she look like just a fan 
 Snorting in the bathroom, paranoia with my man's 
 Salute to the gang, know where we hang 
 Girls all around the yard they follow me like Pacman
