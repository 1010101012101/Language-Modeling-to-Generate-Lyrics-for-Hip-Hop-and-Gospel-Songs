Hold up 'cause I gotta roll up 
 Doing donuts euros don't fold up 
 Four blunts on the road for four months 
 I don't like taking pictures please ignore us 
 I'm abnormal Gargamel cruising in the four door 
 We rolling deep swisher sweets to my portal 
 Nine cat lives got nine silver knives 
 I got big red eyes and I'm feeling so immortal 
 Welcome to my corridor 
 Feeling like a Warlord 
 Exoskeleton I became a martyr 
 Mexico by night if you wanna take a charter 
 Grind a little harder 
 Snow white seven dwarves, chains on baller 
 10 black bottles with my boys overseas 
 Cadillac's like melted cheese 
 Money in my time machine 
 Went to China set me free 
 Silver screens on silver screens 
 Chandeliers I make believe 
 I just do as I please 
 Sipping lean as I sleep 
 Counting money like a sheep 
 Baddest bitch on the side of me 
 She go 
 'Cause she know 
 It's all that I need 
 'Cause she know 
 'Cause she go 
 All my trees 
 Look like seeds 
 Feeling so immortal 
 Feeling like a Warlord 
 My breeze, my chain, my watch 
 Make you freeze 
 My breeze, my chain, my watch 
 Make you freeze
