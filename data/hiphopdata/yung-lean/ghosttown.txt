Stocktown Ghosttown SBE 
 I don't give a fuck about no one except me 
 Stocktown Ghosttown SBE 
 I don't give a fuck about no one except Lean 
 I'm smoking douple pack 
 Louis duffle bag 
 Get the money stack 
 Troubles back 
 I don't give a fuck we jump out the back 
 Where they at keep all my essentials in a zig zag 
 Roll it up take a drag 
 I'm the best at it I don't like to brag 
 Leave my body in the back 
 If you fuck around you in a body bag 
 Burn the flag 
 Fuck who you know I don't fuck with that 
 Couple zeros and a couple tags 
 Tunnel vision 
 Tunnel in the jag 
 Stumble out the hotel lobby 
 Shovel gold knuckles screaming where they at 
 I won't be in your life again but you might see me in a mag 
 Delete my number never call me back 
 Flat on the ground splattered blood on my acroonym bag 
 We from stockttown seasons change 
 Bitch you know ehre we at.
