Diamond in the wind 
 White diamonds across my skin 
 Scandinavian prince 
 Had to start over to begin 
 I'm not sorry for my sins 
 Been here forever, where you been? 
 Got that orange juice and Gin 
 Throw my conscious in a bin 
 Blowing smoke, neo rings 
 Dead soul within 
 Dreaming thick, not thin 
 I'm in the sea but I can't swim 
 Used to be nothing now I win 
 Left my soul to swim 
 Left my soul to swim

 Sad money, dirty heaven 
 Everything is paid for 
 You make cash I make more 
 High on hope and I'm Low on love 
 I ain't got none of that white dove 
 Got butterflies and a white dove 
 I'm crazy and I know I am 
 Don't talk to these fuckers 'cause they know who I am 
 I am worried about nothing that's just who I am 
 I am worried about you 
 What happened to we? 
 Riding the train everyday of the week 
 Writing this song on my phone as we speak 
 Kush in my lungs and I'll die in my sleep 
 Kush in my lungs and I'll die in my sleep 
 Heart on my sleeve 
 And ill crush you to pieces 
 European Jesus 
 Ego big as my phone breaking I don't ever sleep 'cause 
 Thick stack racked up 
 Spend my money on a catbus 
 On a subway smoking green like a cactus 
 My life's too real, fuck an actor 
 Say what you want you need to practice 
 I power up like King Kai 
 I'm smoking wind I'm flying high 
 I'm pretty circus we riding out we riding out

 Sad money, dirty heaven 
 Everything is made for you 
 You make cash, I made more 
 Careful 
 Sunrise Angel in my bed 
 Nothings made well 
 While Lean gets his cash then it's farewell
