Push, push, put the pedal down like push 
 Push, push, I'm with my baby and we up 
 Yung Lean baby on my blue shirt 
 Dropped the window down empty the sugar 
 Pushed the pedal down, she got hunnids on her flow 
 I've been riding around, I got xannies on the floor 
 Chain all froze, lips don't close 
 Leandoer baby I got whips on a go 
 I can take you anywhere that you like 
 Private island, Percocet with a sprite 
 Push, push, we balling like swoosh, swoosh 
 Push, push, I'm with my baby and we up 
 See-through windows, it's so breezy 
 Turquoise pills, right now, life seems easy 
 I can get you anything, we hit the Gucci store 
 Bats flying 'round, lost weekend, you my rose 
 She know, see her everywhere that I look 
 She go faster then lightning, we go swoosh 
 Push, push, put the pedal down like push 
 Push, push, I'm with my baby and we up 
 Push, push, we balling like swoosh, swoosh 
 Push, push, I'm with my baby and we up 
 Ya, ya, ya, got my bands up quick 
 Ya, ya, ya, got my bands up quick 
 Ya, ya, ya, got my bands, bands quick 
 Ya, ya, ya, got my bands up quick
