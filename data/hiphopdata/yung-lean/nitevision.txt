Nice, no distance 
 Nights, night vision 
 Life, existence 
 Night vision in my armor, yeah, I took it over 
 Watching Space Jams, Lean's never sober 
 Stunting with my team, is your baby's mama dream 
 I'm so icy, I'm so clean, Sad Boys, and Yung Lean 
 Drive a body down in my, Range Rover 
 Trying to calm it down like I'm Oprah 
 Po-lice knocking on my window 
 But it's like I told ya, 
 Soon as they approach us, 
 Squash 'em like, co-c-c-c-c-ck'roaches 
 Nice, no distance 
 Nights, night vision 
 Life, existence 
 Nice, existence 
 Sad Boys season, I'm in space for a reason 
 Coke on my clothes, counting stacks up in Sweden 
 My tree's spent, let me, let me get me some 
 Three headed dolphin, it's the threesome 
 Lean, Lean and Hennessy and Sprite 
 With the cheese and the mac to your back 
 Make you believe in religion 
 Found upon, gods in the season, Sad Boys season 
 Digimon, plane crashes, smoke hash till the ashes 
 Vietnam flashes 
 Ecstasy in the glass 
 Iced out patches, on my scars, but it's rashes 
 Digimon, plane crashes, smoke hash till the ashes 
 Vietnam flashes 
 Nice, no distance 
 Nights, night vision 
 Life, existence 
 Nice, existence 
 Arizona 
 Arizona, Arizona, Arizona Iced Out Boys 
 Emotional Boys, taking over the noise 
 Night vision, camera flashes 
 Smoke hash till the ashes 
 Sad Boys 
 Night vision, nice existence
