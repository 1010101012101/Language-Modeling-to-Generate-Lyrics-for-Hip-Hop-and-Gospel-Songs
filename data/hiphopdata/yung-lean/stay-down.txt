Way up 
 (?) 
 I'm rollin' blowin' away, the days are the same 
 10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith 
 R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame 
 Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait 
 I'm rollin' blowin' away, the days look the same 
 10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith 
 R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame 
 Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait 
 I gotta stay down, stay down, stay down 
 I guess I gotta stay down, stay down, stay down 
 Girl, I'll be around, around, around forever 
 I'll be around, around somewhere up there 
 Nitrous-Oxic-ide, I just saw the sign, I seen the world collide 
 I lost count of all the times, she ask me why 
 Ma-ma-magic in her eyes, Leandoer's paradise 
 All my, all my, boys off drugs, I've been lost in this life 
 Fire flames, color red, 'member recent times 
 Stacks of shoes, got so many, don't really the 'mount 
 When it's hot outside, I copped me some ice 
 Travel in disguise, I see trouble in her eyes 
 Mix it with fanta, not with sprite, wings from Calvin Klein 
 Forever I'll fly, all the times I rewind, cause some way... 
 Some way, some how, I'm good in the sky 
 I got a white shirt and a tangerine belt 
 I'm in a winter where the snow don't melt 
 'Cause I keep to myself, 'cause I keep to myself 
 I'm rollin' blowin' away, the days are the same 
 10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith 
 R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame 
 Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait 
 I'm rollin' blowin' away, the days look the same 
 10 pills in my pocket, I keep blowin' my faith 
 R-r-rollin' down the window, white widow, fuck fame 
 Forest fire, climbin' higher, real life, it can wait 
 Gotta stay down stay down stay down 
 I guess I gotta stay down stay down 
 Girl, I'll be around, around, around, 
 Forever I'll be around, around some way up
