 B-bitch named Lean, Emperor of the city 
 Silver rings on, sitting on 50 
 Blowing on Winter, icy like a stunner 
 Looking like Winter, temperature like the summer 
 Chain like a seahorse, It's everything Leandoer 
 All white Dior, all I wear is Dior 
 Catch me on my samsung, SBE anthem 
 I be in the night creeping round' like the phantom

 Airbrushed, Air ice 
 Like I'm 19 
 Light speed 
 Colour, lime green look like ice cream 
 Light beam, call it light stream 
 Or you'll white beam 
 Five keys or my eyes bleed 
 On the Nikes 
 Headlock, scope red dot 
 It's a head shot 
 Shell shock, do the air-drop 
 I got dead stock 
 Flow like purple drugs sprite 
 That's my blood type 
 I was mad that this was real life 
 But it's sunlight 
 You don't know what I'm up too 
 We don't talk about it 'less you do 
 Got a fight crew, we sky team 
 Shoot around town, got bad dreams
