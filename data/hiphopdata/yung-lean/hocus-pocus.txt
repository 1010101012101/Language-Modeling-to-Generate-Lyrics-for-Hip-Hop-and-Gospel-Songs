All I roll is potent, we stay golden 
 We gone hokus pokus, they think they know us 
 I'm flyin' in a lotus, in a range rover 
 Is my life over? 
 Take, take, take, take 
 Take control of, take control of me 
 Take control of lean, take control of me 
 It takes control of me 
 White powder like a hill, take control of me 
 When it hits my body, you know there's no stoppin' lean 
 I don't like red, paint the roses green 
 Put a price up on my head, there's no controllin' me 
 I thought I was dead, but I'm livin' free 
 Walk up in the spot, bitch, it's SBE 
 Stack the money green, turn it into leaves 
 Six Air Force on my feet look like a centipede 
 All I roll is potent, we stay golden 
 We gone hokus pokus, they think they know us 
 I'm flyin' in a lotus, in a range rover 
 Is my life over? is, is it over? 
 She don't want to understand, but I have a plan 
 Mixing alcohol and xans, when I'm with my gang 
 You can find me where I stand, Disney wonderland 
 I don't ever get attached, doesn't work like that 
 Doesn't work like that 
 Black bracelet, never show faces 
 Two pills runnin' round in the matrix 
 Never show faces, never show faces 
 Two pills runnin' round in the matrix 
 All I roll is potent, we stay golden 
 We gone hokus pokus, they think they know us 
 I'm flyin' in a lotus, in a range rover 
 Is my life over? is, is, it over? 
 All I roll is potent, we stay golden 
 We gone hokus pokus, they think they know us 
 I'm flyin' in a lotus, in a range rover 
 Is my life over? is, is it over? 
 Lotus, ranger rover, is, is, it over?
