For real a child of god, done made an watched me grow 
 Like I done watched an served fiends, made they addictions grow 
 Caught by 5-0, not me, never no 
 I'm a child of god, elemental like I'll make it snow 
 You know, God, forgive me 
 I ain't livin' all pious 
 An my sins could send me eternal to the dark lords fires 
 From lightin up the strip wit heaters 
 To coke fiends pipes wit they lighters 
 But I ask, do a thug a favour 
 Let me in line, 
 An when I get there I'll slang no more of them fine white lines, 
 No sacks sellin' for dimes, just some chopped up bub 
 God's Son rockin' Heaven with a bottle of bub 
 Don't need my snub 
 'Cause lord you got my back 
 Smite any other nigga who can front on that 
 'Cause this real nigga rap 
 Jeezy in the booth 
 Child of God, rap's saviour spittin' truth in the booth
