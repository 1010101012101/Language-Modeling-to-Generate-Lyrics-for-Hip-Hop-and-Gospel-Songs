I just wanna say my fault my bad 
 You couldn't do young too bad so sad 
 Re-up too big might need 2 bags 
 Soon as I drop this might go pop tags 
 Might do big mall might do car lot 
 Might call "vezzy" might buy wristwatch 
 Might just chill in might just club hop 
 Might invest mine all blocks no stocks 
 Young'n run this shit you know that 
 Really who must them bricks they know that 
 Hood trap money my shits throwback 
 I said what rap money might just blow that 
 I said I might just blow that I might just blow that (repeat X8) 
 Nigga I run this, no trapping 
 Your money paid for it might of came with a back seat 
 Not even ashtray not even a cup holder 
 I said not even a car phone 
 And the fuck is my moral? 
 Save all this well than you might be a rich nigga 
 Act like you and then he might be a bitch nigga 
 Talk like this well den he might be a dope dealer 
 Worked out for him should that make him a hood nigga? 
 Young'n run this shit you know that 
 Really who must them bricks they know that 
 Hood trap money my shits throwback 
 I said what rap money might just blow that 
 I said I might just blow that I might just blow that (repeat X8) 
 (Third Verse) 
 Might just know this might be too well 
 Way this going might need two scales 
 Might need four hands two box one stove 
 Mr.Hiiragi Might call in Kinkos 
 Might just show up anyplace anytime 
 Might just forget shit what you say? Nevermind. 
 Might just black out might just spaz out 
 Pull 'em tracks out blow 'em back out. 
 Young'n run this shit you know that 
 Really must bought them bricks they know that 
 Hood trap money my shits throwback 
 I said what rap money might just blow that 
 I said I might just blow that I might just blow that (repeat X8)
