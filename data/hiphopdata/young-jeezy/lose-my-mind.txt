 Drink like a tank, lose my mind 
 This shit crazy, way to bad 
 Rozay baby, waste 2 stackz 
 Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine 
 Can't spell sober, lost my mind 
 I'm hearin voices in my head think I'm skitzafrantic 
 I swear they sayin' let's get it from anotha planet 
 36 a thousand times I'm doin' summer saltz 
 Do it right and you can leave ya whole summer off 
 I'm out my mind, yeah a nigga seein double y'all 
 Now tell me what's the chance of jizzle fuckin' both of y'all 
 She said as long as we can do it wit ya ice on 
 If that's the case we might as well leave the lights on 
 I'm out my mind, just blew a thousand swisher sweets 
 In my black and orange charger, call it trick or treat 
 It ain't nothin' to a boss, my goons got goons 
 How stupid dumb big, my rooms got rooms 
 Why y'all trippin', I'm just fine

 Couldn't get it all week, time to unwind 
 Drink like a tank, lose my mind

 Can't spell sober, lost my mind 
 Plies 
 Guess wat my momma told me, she hate my patnas 
 Guess why she hate 'em though, 
 'Cause all of 'em robbin' 
 Fuck da police, 'cause all of 'em problems 
 White girls fun, 'cause all of 'em swallow 
 Why I ain't fuck ha at the house, 'cause the bitch hollered 
 And where the pill man at, he need a blue dolphin 
 Ol broke azz nigga, stop cock blockin 
 Security, I need help 'cause the bitch stalkin 
 A half fuckin' mill, that's what the whip cost me 
 One-hundred dollaz, that's what the pussy cost me 
 And when the nigga start hatin', that's when the nigga lost me 
 Fantastico, that's what the hoez, that's what the hoes call me 
 Why y'all trippin', I'm just fine 
 12:45, bout dat time 
 Couldn't get it it all week, time to unwind 
 Drink like a tank, lose my mind 
 This shit crazy, way to bad 
 Rozay baby, waste 2 stackz 
 Hardest thing in the lot, that there mine 
 Can't spell sober, lost my mind 
 Drop the top, no broad, got ha titties out 
 Mention my name and bring da whole city out 
 Doing what I do best, d-boy stuntin 
 New car, old money, d-boy stuntin 
 Step in cleaner then a new glock-40 
 Nick name in the A, strapped up shawty 
 You know my nerves bad, trigger like a toothepick 
 Line wrapped around the corner, boy too big 
 G-Code, black shadez and my black chainz 
 But if you wouldn't undastand, it's a black thing 
 You know we drink that rozay till we black out 
 Wake up, drink some more, pass back out 
 Why y'all trippin', I'm just fine 
 12:45, bout that time 
 Ain't done it all week, time to unwind 
 Drink like a tank, lose my mind 
 Dis shit crazy, way to bad 
 Rozay baby, waste 2 stackz 
 Hardest thing in the lot, that there mine 
 Can't spell sober, lost my mind
