Ay (16x) 
 It's young jizzle from the bottom of the map 
 Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap 
 (Ay) (8x) 
 I do it for the trappers with tha-tha-tha rocks 
 And them O-G niggas with tha-tha-tha blocks 
 (Ay) (8x) 
 I'm strapped up, I'm iced out 
 A nigga play, its lights out 
 Cost a cool quarter million, that's how you'll find me 
 Swirvin through traffic with them goons behind me 
 Ya betta call ya crew, you gon need help 
 Whole car strapped and I ain't talkin' seat belts 
 Red cross nigga, yeah we draw blood 
 Whole team got choppers like a bike club 
 I don't get mad, I just get money 
 And laugh at these fuck niggas 'cause they so funny 
 All a gangsta do is stay fresh 
 .45 with the gucci teflon vest 
 It's young jizzle from the bottom of the map 
 Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap 
 (Ay) (8x) 
 I do it for the trappers with tha-tha-tha rocks 
 And them O-G niggas with tha-tha-tha blocks 
 (Ay) (8x) 
 I'm on fire the kids outta control 
 Competition want me to stop, drop, and roll 
 Like I had a flame thrower and some gasoline 
 Set the city on fire thas on everything 
 I walk around like I got a grip in my pants 
 Yeah thas about 10 stacks half a brick in my pants 
 Fish scale got papi on speed dial 
 Ya niggas gettin' raped ya still gettin' oil base 
 My flow is bananas, the coop is grape 
 These vizoo jeans with the bathing apes 
 Desert on the pillow choppers on the night stand 
 You can roll the dice play with ur life man 
 It's young jizzle from the bottom of the map 
 Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap 
 (Ay) (8x) 
 I do it for the trappers with tha-tha-tha rocks 
 And them O-G niggas with tha-tha-tha blocks 
 (Ay) (8x) 
 All that tuff talk ya just wastin ya breath 
 Hit ya ass with them things have ya chasin ya breath 
 You got a loose lips... ya betta put a collar on em 
 Black chenelle frames I spent a cuple dollas on em 
 Hole zip of kush just to get mah mind right 
 Russian roll see the ones get my sound right 
 My money come fast so thas how I spend it 
 Trunk soundin like it got a marchin band in it 
 U in the minor leagues, and I'm a heavy weight 
 Flippin brick house, we call it real estate 
 5 thousand for the pound get ya curb serviced 
 Sell a lot of grass like I got a lawn service 
 It's young jizzle from the bottom of the map 
 Got a 50 round clip on the bottom of the strap 
 (Ay) (8x) 
 I do it for the trappers with tha-tha-tha rocks 
 And them O-G niggas with tha-tha-tha blocks 
 (Ay) (8x)
