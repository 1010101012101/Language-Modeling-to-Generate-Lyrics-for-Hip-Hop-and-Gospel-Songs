 Only god can judge me who the fuck is you

 Neva eva eva serve a nigga where you sleep at 
 Police b atcha door nd nigga you ain't tryna c dat

 Young live from the trap 
 Ion chase no brads I chase money nd vodka 
 Nxt time I re-up ima buy me a chopper 
 Nd I ain't talkin' the ak I'm talkin' shit wit propellers 
 Fly to the club make my old bitch jealous 
 Thug motivation this is straight celebration 
 I c jizzle in his chopper outside central station 
 This ain't a mixtape but the tapes mixed 
 Black tape grey tape bought 'em 1 brick 
 Get it on the flo ge-get it on the flo 
 Last night swear to god half a mill on the flo 
 Fell asleep on the money like a pillow on the flo 
 Woke up got money had to get it off the flo 
 Wat you know about 20 grand stuffed in a white sock 
 Pull off in a white drop like I play 4 the white sox 
 Play wit them white blocks play wit them white squares 
 U call it wat you want who the fuck cares 
 Ion neva sleep why too paranoid 
 State of paranoia all I do's call my lawyer 
 Tell him I know a nigga that might have a lil trouble 
 Ok you know it's me if you beat it I'll pay you double 
 Y'all niggas know it's me if I want to I'll make it double 
 Jus know its water whipped so you might have a lil trouble 
 Might move a lil slower might get a few complaints 
 Say he ran outta gas he might need a half a tank 
 Thank god its Friday fresh off the highway 
 Say he 2 minutes out he bouta pull in the driveway 
 In the driveway take the work out 
 Cut the duck tape check the work out 
 Young!
