I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over 
 And don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya 
 I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over 
 And don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya 
 Said I'm going in shawty I got this little niggas 
 I'm lighting mama babys daddy I'm doubt these little niggas 
 Still acting like they in or out these little niggas 
 I survived many magic in my house these little niggas 
 See I ain't tryin' to brag I ain't tryin' to boast 
 And since we talking that guess who sold the most 
 Yeah damn right not even close 
 I'm the type of nigga to re-up could buy a boat 
 And when I say boat just so I meant a yacht 
 We talking about those cars just know that I got alot 
 Yeah no nigga just know I got a alot 
 I'm a trampolince nigga just know I flip before I flop 
 I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over 
 And don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya 
 I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over 
 And don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya 
 They ask me why do I never stress 'cause I'm the best 
 Hello world you're rocking with young so fuck the rest 
 My aunty mother let me borrow a kiss and I never miss? 
 She always used to clean up behind me love her to death 
 I used too busy off on the block with the crackheads 
 I rather do that then sleep in a packed bed 
 Talking about so much pee stains wish I was dead 
 Wish I could sleep aside this bitch wish I was ten 
 You don't know that my nigga I'm bumpin that slick daddy 
 Thinking how could get my son the rich daddy 
 I could sell me some dope I'm writing some dope thrines 
 And that's how you kill some birds with one dime 
 I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over 
 And don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya 
 I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over 
 And don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya 
 I'm in the a-town fitted that's blue with the red benz 
 I'm a holla tips with me just and him just us in the black? 
 I got them martin lawerence stones in my ear them bring 'em streets 
 Last time I looked down I was buyig for two weeks 
 I was once the mvp in the triple beam team 
 And push the lamborghini that's listerine green 
 What the fresh that bitch was clean 
 Mustve sucked from a little pms that bitch was mean 
 I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over 
 And don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya 
 I said the game the game yeah it's over it's over 
 And don't forget to tell 'em that I told ya 
 Let's go!
