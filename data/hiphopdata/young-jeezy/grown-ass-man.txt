It's not 
 Ay ay ay ay 
 Turn the lights down a little bit 
 Turn my mic up a lil bit 
 Y'all ready y'all ready 
 Here I stand a grown ass man 
 All by myself a grown ass man 
 A young nigga with some grown ass plans 
 Don't point fingers, you don't know that man 
 You don't know what's hard 
 You don't know what's pain 
 You ain't lookin' through that scope 
 You don't know its aim 
 Minus all the videos stickers and flyers 
 Most of these rappers are composive liars 
 They can't help it, they need some help 
 Tell me wat kind of nigga tell lies 2 himself 
 They'll turn round tell da same lies to his fans 
 Guess them real niggas in fantasy land 
 I can't wake you niggas up, you must be dreamin' 
 Ya shit ain't addin up you ain't what ya seamin 
 Ya niggas is outta order like soda machines 
 Young jeezy keep it colder like soda machines 
 Ya ain't never seen them pies 
 I'm talkin' so much white, it'll hurt ya eyes 
 I really lived it man 
 Counted so much paper it'll hurt ya hands 
 From the trucks to the rental to the grey hound bus 
 The same old shit and adrennalin rush 
 I tried to tell the people that the streets is watchin 
 Same time be safe 'cause them peoples watchin 
 Two hundread thousand mix tapes later 
 From the streets of the chat to the hoods to the gator 
 Same young nigga made a killin' with the snow 
 Turned right around and made a killin' wit the flow 
 The whole city at my show, they recitin my words 
 I guess they like the way I recite them birds 
 Prolly go to jail for some of the shit I said 
 Realist nigga ever done it, breathin or dead 
 Two record deals, radio still wont play me 
 But I don't give a fuck, 'cause them streets done made me 
 Said I was affiliated wit all them gangsta kids 
 Fuck ya thought I was gon do, turn my back on my niggas 
 Now I can't slow down, 'cause its close to stoppin' 
 Got errybody askin, when da album droppin' 
 Da hottest nigga in da city, wit no radio play 
 When less is gettin' dropped, we'll see wat you niggaz'll say 
 Trap or die nigga!
