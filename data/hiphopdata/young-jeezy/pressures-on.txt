Intro/chorus: 
 Yeah when the pressures on 
 Yeah when the pressures on 
 Yeah when the pressures on 
 Yeah when the pressures on 
 What you gonna do when the pressues on? 
 I'm a post up in the club with my necklace on 
 And I'm a go hard till they exit me holmes 
 And I'm a bounce right back if they let me go 
 What you gonna do when the pressures on? 
 I'm a post up in the club with my necklace on 
 And I'm a go hard till they exit me holmes 
 And do the whole ten years if they catch me on 
 See it's matter over mind grind over matter 
 If you stay focused on yours nigga mine should'ntmatter 
 Y'all make way I think that's boys bout to fall 
 Just to let you know if I slip then I'm falling on y'all 
 It's my ? I ain't sorry I ain't never seed that we can go see maury 
 Listen here hoe see you're playing with a g 
 Tell 'em put a stack on it I got a million on me 
 Young going hard started readying this bitch 
 Wouldn't fuck that with another man's dick 
 Young and two real of these hoes too silly 
 Drop one on one and I go millie 
 Push your bus pipes? oh is that what they say? 
 Oh no you might wanna bring it back DJ 
 Make you wanna get money play it at your own risk 
 I can show what to do you gotta use your own wrist 
 When the pressures on 
 What you gonna do when the pressues on? 
 I'm a post up in the club with my necklace on 
 And I'm a go hard till they exit me holmes 
 And I'm a bounce right back if they let me go 
 What you gonna do when the pressures on? 
 I'm a post up in the club with my necklace on 
 And I'm a go hard till they exit me holmes 
 And do the whole ten years if they catch me on 
 When there's so many chippers saying I'm running outta time 
 Guess I'm ain't the only one that lost my mind 
 Y'all done lost your mind y'all bump your head 
 Make sure I remember that when I'm counting my bread 
 Got me all up on my swagger me acting like a rapper 
 Hear the words scramble and talking like a trapper 
 Kill you like this homie this is how it is 
 Call lollywood nigga this is how I live 
 Fuck what ya heard young to like living 
 Came from the bottom so I know that feeling 
 Sure had a grind when I ain had sauce 
 You can try and judge me y'all go head on 
 Hit ya a grind when I had no hits 
 You know I had to grind when I had no kicks 
 It came from the west they ain't gave me shit 
 What's with kayne west he can't tell me shit 
 When the pressures on 
 What you gonna do when the pressues on? 
 I'm a post up in the club with my necklace on 
 And I'm a go hard till they exit me holmes 
 And I'm a bounce right back if they let me go 
 What you gonna do when the pressures on? 
 I'm a post up in the club with my necklace on 
 And I'm a go hard till they exit me holmes 
 And do the whole ten years if they catch me on 
 When I'm in the street I ain't like what I'm hearing 
 Word on the street they ain't like what I'm steering 
 Oops my bad let me take it back 
 Pull back up in that black on black 
 Let's all tell it it was over back then 
 Catch a nigga see man all I do is win 
 I never lose if I lose I lost 
 I can't tell ya how much just know I paid the cost 
 That's why youngs the boss nigga ow ow 
 Still setting off motherfucka pow pow 
 Paid my dues and I kept my receipts 
 Y'all be about be the reasons I ain't getting sleep 
 Young applied pressure and stays on your neck 
 Take two nigga I been had it on deck 
 So roll up my igga that's excessive and a fact 
 And when you're jammin my shit that's excess in your deck 
 When the pressures on...
