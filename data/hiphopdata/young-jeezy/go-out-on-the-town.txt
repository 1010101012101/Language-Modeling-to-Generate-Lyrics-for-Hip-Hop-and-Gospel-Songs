This the shit that happen when we go out on the town 
 This the shit that happen when we go out on the town 
 Bottles get to poppin' and them bitches get to jocking 
 And the kush bag that we smoking running out 
 Pull up to the club, you can hear the car park 
 Tip the door man, so you know I gotta gun 
 Promo done already paid my money 
 I'ma make it rain on sugar and honey 
 Bigga baby Bigga baby, ball like a dog 
 It's enough for me to go after both of y'all 
 Me and my click we the t-shirt gang 
 ? Niggas deep, going "bang bang bang!" 
 Black T, black t, bottles in the air 
 Niggas think Jay Boy and Meetch back here 
 Niggas think 
 This the shit that happen when we go out on the town 
 This the shit that happen when we go out on the town 
 Bottles get to poppin' and them bitches get to jocking 
 And the kush bag that we smoking running out

 Let go, get the car meet me in the old valley 
 From everything new to the old Chevroley 
 Half of them them bitches ain't got no top 
 Half of them bitches part brand new trucks 
 All them bitches got brand new wheels 
 None of my niggers ain't got no deal 
 None of my niggers ain't got no job 
 All of my niggers got 2-3 cars 
 What you mean nigger ain't got no care 
 Like telling og ain't got no air 
 Don't look nine nigger ...on the stage 
 ...Nigger got a raise 
 How you know a nigg ...all that work 
 ...Why a nigger ain't so hard in the city 
 'Cause they got a 3-4 spots in the city 
 ...On the east, hard on the west, smoke on the south side, 
 ... 
 Yo all know the risk 
 ...To old and it ain't no blood, ain't coping no stone and it ain't no what 
 Hit it in the front and it ain't no coupe, and ... and it ain't no Snoop 
 GA baby wanna smoke that brown, your name ain't Young and this ain't your town 
 None said pussy like the 3 rose, a lot ... free oze 
 None say chips like free do lay, keep playing that ... like go deejay 
 Matter of fact all free all my niggers gotta ... my niggers 
 Know what I did that you might be ... one more time and I might spit eleven
