New shoes on the Range Rover, good one man 
 (Vroom) 
 Motherfuckers acting like I ain't supposed to shine 
 I ain't the 1, definitely not the 2 
 (Nope) 
 1 in the chamber when we aiming at you 
 (Blaou) 
 The young Bob Barker, the price is right 
 If you C O D, then you could get them tonight 
 Put the fish scale on the scale 
 If Roy went postal, all he do is check mail 
 (Ha, ha) 
 Low key, under the radar 
 Triple black velvet, yeah I call it the stealth 
 No currency machine, I could count it myself 
 Almost done, another quarter million in ones 
 Thunderstorm in the body tap, look what I've done 
 Chump change, I make it rain for fun 
 (Wassup) 
 Snowman, get cha' hands up high 
 It's ya' boy, Mr. 17, 5 
 I take it back to the block, 
 Back to the kitchen, back to the pots 
 Snowman, get cha' hands up high 
 It's ya' boy, Mr. 17, 5 
 I take it back to the block, 
 Back to the kitchen, back to the pots 
 I get them bars out of the back of my mind 
 (That's how) 
 I reminisce like Mary J 
 Even in the drought, the boy kept that yay 
 100 percent served, Snowman's word 
 You can play my thug and my clientele 
 (Why?) 
 I'm addicted to that new car smell 
 White cookies in a plastic bag 
 New shoes on the coupe with the paper tag 
 Whole life flash right before your eyes 
 See the state troopers and get butterflies 
 Got a thing for them Heckler and Koches 
 A minute 14 and Rolex watches 
 Somewhere in the back of my secret deranged brain 
 I get a rush when I tote that 'cane 
 Get money, Nigga fuck them haters 
 All we fear is the discovery and indictment papers 
 (Wassup) 
 Snowman, get cha' hands up high 
 It's ya' boy, Mr. 17, 5 
 I take it back to the block 
 Back to the kitchen, back to the pots 
 Snowman, get cha' hands up high 
 It's ya' boy, Mr. 17, 5 
 I take it back to the block 
 Back to the kitchen, back to the pots 
 I'm a grown ass man, I stand on my own two 
 200, 000 cash, yeah, I'm buying my own team 
 Right to your front door, operation so sweet 
 I like little dude who keeps his money so neat 
 But I still bury a nigga 
 Put The Mask on Jim Carey, a nigga 
 (Blaou) 
 Suede ends in the Chevy, got me feelin' awkward 
 Careful with the sweets, don't burn my seats 
 You could live your whole life and not come close 
 Guess that's why these rap niggaz take notes 
 Rectite my adlibs, borrow my quotes 
 Make me Ihop a nigga, serve them with the toast 
 Next, they be dressing like me 
 But back in '93, they wasn't stressing like me 
 (Wassup) 
 Snowman, get cha' hands up high 
 It's ya' boy, Mr. 17, 5 
 I take it back to the block 
 Back to the kitchen, back to the pots 
 Snowman, get cha' hands up high 
 It's ya' boy, Mr. 17, 5 
 I take it back to the blocks 
 Back to the kitchen, back to the pots
