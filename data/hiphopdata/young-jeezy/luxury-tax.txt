E-class 
 I think we got a problem 
 Yeah 
 Big money in this bitch if you didn't knew 
 Big business minus the business suit 
 Even I look in the mirror like is it you 
 And I say I must be the hottest if it isn't you 
 Stay fresh from my top to my tennis shoes 
 New coupe, no top, big tennis shoes 
 Never slipped, not even on the side of a swimming pool 
 We don't get ridiculed, 
 We get rid of fools 
 They said I couldn't play football I was too small 
 They say I couldn't play basketball I wasn't tall 
 They say I couldn't play baseball at all 
 And now everyday of my life I ball! 
 And they say ya' ain't raining until someone assassinate, 
 And I feel like M-L-K 
 Yeah, I have a dream to be your worst nightmare, 
 And now meet the boss of the cartel 
 (Ross!) 
 I'm a seven-nine Satan, sitting on Lorenz's 
 And I seem really patient, picture the equation 
 People taking pictures and they really getting fragrant 
 Flags down my spaceship, sergeant sniffin' for a fragrance 
 Yeyo, Yeyo, he wanna sniff the yeyo, flying saucer on the house 
 In the casa just to lay-low 
 Make more (money man) that the model for the mob 
 Need a blow-job my model, get a model for the job 
 Go hard, no job, hustler, no prob, poster, 
 Nigga what finger fuck you whole squad. 
 Forty around extendo, flipping for my kin folk 
 Luxury tax on them packs if you didn't know 
 Bought a new crib, niggas feeling like I hid 
 Three point two but I just did it for the kids 
 More guns than a pawn shop, 
 Got my whole arm rocked. 
 Keep the seven sexty double parked in the wrong spot 
 Still hustling 
 Boss! 
 Yeah 
 You gotta pay for this, 
 I remember when I used to pray for this 
 This, this is classic, 
 Some shit you might not see again 
 And we taxin', you don't want it nigga leave it then, 
 And we taxin', you don't want it nigga leave it then 
 And we ain't trying to see the pen, 
 Like a needle in a hay stack we ain't trying to see the pen 
 This is a luxury tax 
 (I don't ask them baby I just tax 'em baby) 
 (Let's go) 
 Yeah imagine this, 
 No imagine that 
 Gave me my sack like, good luck getting back (Yeah) 
 I'm like how the fuck I'm gonna get outta there 
 And if I'm not careful, 
 Leave 'em the same place they find him there 
 And I'm a winner if I make it cross the finish line, 
 Putting food on the table like it's dinner time 
 And this is what you call stereotyping by far? 
 Can you tell me me why your dog keep sniffing my car? 
 Huh? Got the audacity to call me a liar 
 So what you got in your trunk? 
 Oh, just a spare tire 
 You niggas talked blow, 
 While I sold mine 
 Like a bad cramp, it's locking up in no time 
 More time in the kitchen then I spent in the studio, 
 Gangsters paradise and I ain't talking about Coolio 
 Can't lie, still addicted to the odor 
 Got a ice cold Pepsi, 
 But still thinking Coke-Cola 
 Ha ha ha 
 I'm up early in the morning, and I'm dressed in black 
 Hold on, every morning I get dressed in black 
 While your half ass, nigga my pants saggin', 
 I'm getting money, and my swaggin' and black flaggin' 
 Million dollar status, fully automatic 
 Heavy on the henny and even harder on the women 
 If it wasn't for rappin', 
 I probably would pimpin' and shit 
 Pops, my papi, has already hear me 
 I tried trapping, shit sent me to prison, 
 Got mad and went to savage so homicide came to visit 
 I smell gun powder, 
 So you got one hour to come up with every damn dollar, 
 Or your dun-dolla 
 It cost a ball dog, 
 Especially when the players on your team, 
 Consider you as the ball hog. 
 You treat me like Shaq, 
 And you Kobe but I didn't say you owe me nigga 
 But act like you know me nigga
