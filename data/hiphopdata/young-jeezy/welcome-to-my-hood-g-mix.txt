One in the hole, cause these n-ggas will test ya 
 Them indictments come round, that shit there, stress ya 
 FBI, GBI, either way they ain't playing 
 Nothin' stopping this money, guess that's all that I'm saying 
 2 milli in cash, that paper look like it standing 
 Even taller than me, that paper look like its canon 
 Take them bricks out the bag, them bitches look like they pilin' 
 Stack them up on the dresser, bitches look like they smilin' 
 Then it's back to the soda, back to the yoda 
 All this white in this kitchen I got this bitch looking polar 
 Another 300 racks, that's in the safe in the closet 
 Got the pyrex at hand, going hard at the faucet
