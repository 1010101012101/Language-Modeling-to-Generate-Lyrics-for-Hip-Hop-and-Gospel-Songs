 So just respect my conglomerate

 It's Bus Rhymes and I'm back 
 With the crack and the thugs and the drugs, nigga black 
 The best to do it, we only deal with the facts, bitch 
 Blazin' that I'm so amazin' on the tracks, bitch 
 Bounce on 'em and I jump and I skip 
 And I hop and I flip over niggas like gymnastics 
 Watch the way I come and I'm givin' the streets acid 
 Bastards, niggas know I'm the king of the classics 
 Drastic measures, I'm spreadin' like a rash, bitch 
 Class is in session, you 'bout to get yo' ass kicked 
 Emperor of every roundtable of the house 
 And when I speak niggas respect me as leader of the councilman 
 God rap, god persona, god scrilla 
 God body in the flesh, call me Godzilla 
 Now you know you see we be the most prominent 
 Dominant, niggas respect my conglomerate 
 Since we are the best and you agree with me, right?

 I tell 'em hold up, swoll' up, yee ain't see us rollin' up 
 See them broads froze up, soon do's open up 
 Hey ladies, you likin' what ya see? 
 American Gangster, my strap's European 
 Came with a scope, got a navy feel 
 So I can ambush niggas like the Navy Seals 
 My defensive line lookin' like some linebackers 
 Most six cars, the other half, carjackers 
 Ballers with them thangs, yeah, we call 'em contractors 
 And if ya in boys right then they might contract ya 
 40 cal lookin' sweet on them honeycomb seats 
 Just like Cassie, my Sean John freak 
 Get you what ya want, just not that deep 
 Yet thirteen'll split, got them may-ride seats 
 Two for the Madonna, the may-ride freak 
 You know I brought the whole team, so the yay ride deep 
 Since we are the best and you agree with me, right? 
 No need to debate, the way we bum shit

 Workers, bosses, Ferraris, Porches 
 Dope fiends nauseous, crack spot, losses 
 Race track, horses 
 Big meetings at the round table to discuss what the cost is 
 Money change you, devils, angels 
 We the ones who say what you can and what you can't do 
 Respect, power, kush, sour 
 Haze, airy, pills, powder 
 Gangsters, varmints, ice, garments 
 Don shit, real niggas who I get it on with 
 When I'm around, my colleagues ain't comfortable 
 They all got a sick with my verses for a month or two 
 Wrong nigga to have a problem with 
 The blade first then the bullet gon' follow it 
 Yeah, if you lucky, I might hollow it 
 D-block, just respect my conglomerate 
 Since we are the best and you agree with me, right? 
 No need to debate, the way we bum shit 
 See we're kind of like the government
