Man, them young niggas killing 'bout nothing 
 Show up at the spot with the choppers like nothing 
 Full fifty shots, clear the block like nothing 
 If you made it from the bottom to the top like nothing 
 You don't owe a nigga nothing 
 Nothing, nothing, nothing 
 You don't owe a nigga nothing 
 Nothing, nothing, nothing 
 You don't owe a nigga 
 Put your cups in the air, I'd like to make a toast 
 In case it goes down, yeah, you know I got my toast 
 And when you really from the streets, that's when they hate you most 
 And when you really got it then that's when they hate you close 
 Knew him back in the day when we was getting money 
 Now every time I see the nigga he be actin' funny 
 Don't you niggas see it? I'm a little pressed for time 
 Wanna talk about the past, told 'em press rewind 
 And I ain't feeling what you saying hoe, you out of place 
 I have you feeling what I'm spraying, yeah, it's on my waist 
 I'm trying to chill, smoke a couple with my lady friend 
 So they can meet me at the telly in the latest Benz

 Nigga, you see me getting mine, you better get yours 
 Are you the one doing the serving or you getting served? 
 Or you the one doing the jacking or you getting jacked 
 Or you the one that's going hard or you falling back 
 And I don't believe in falling back, bitch, I'm going hard 
 They wanna see me fucked up, man I swear to God 
 They praying that I fail, they praying that I rise 
 I guess the hating didn't work so now they telling lies 
 Oh, he ain't did this, and he ain't did that
