 It hurt so bad I need tylenol, 
 At first though it was the muzik but the pack too loud. 
 Ask why he ain't have it in the glove compartment, 
 I told that mutha fucka nigga cause' my strap too proud. 
 I ain't gonna ask, know you heard of me, 
 Dial 911 it's an emergency. 
 Dope boy swag better feel this shit 
 Y'all already know I'm bout to kill this shit. 
 (Repeat) 
 Hat to tha back, matter of fact got new shoes and all

 Droppin' bout 240 an all 
 Just like that massive strap, 
 Scuff my shit I'm takin' me back to tha mall 
 Ask ya lil brotha look we always there 
 Told that bitch gimme all tha pairs 
 More money in my jeans then ya ever knew ever knew ever seen 
 Wat ya sellin play boy that's everything lil bit of hard lil bit of green lil bit of soft lil bit of clean
