She said, she said, you ain't no good, no good 
 But if you feel so good 
 She said, she said, what if I could? 
 But I gotta leave you alone, ah 
 She said I gotta leave you alone 
 I, she said, I know you bad 
 But I want you bad 
 She said, she said, makes me so sad 
 That I gotta leave you alone 
 I said, I gotta leave you alone 
 Look, look, look 
 I got my mind on my money, 
 All I need is a bad bitch 
 That I can run through the city spend this cash with 
 That I can ride through this city spend this cash on 
 Wake up in the morning get my smash on 
 I want more much baby egg whites 
 Keep your stomach in your thighs and your legs right 
 While I'm out here focus getting this bread right 
 But if the head right, Jeezy there every night 
 Wake up in the morning and you're still here 
 Wake up in the morning and I ain't gone 
 All I ask, let me just do me 
 And maybe just me and you can get along 
 Had them other bitches mad when they seen us 
 Had to match our rolexes baby team us 
 Yeah the earth is our turf we can share the world 
 Maybe even go half on a baby girl 
 She said, she said, you ain't no good, no good 
 But if you feel so good 
 She said, she said, what if I could? 
 But I gotta leave you alone, ah 
 She said I gotta leave you alone 
 I, she said, I know you bad 
 But I want you bad 
 She said, she said, makes me so sad 
 That I gotta leave you alone 
 I said, I gotta leave you alone 
 Look, look, look 
 Let me be your mind reader, let me read your mind 
 And when I'm done with the front, hit it from behind 
 Love a loyalty never cross the line 
 Just hit a nigger up when I cross your mind 
 So you ... you won't be watching mine 
 Put your... so you hard to shine 
 And maybe we can kick it when I got the time 
 Be my back bone every nigga need a ... 
 Gotta know you ride with me if I'm right or wrong 
 Case I wake up in the morning and it's all gone 
 Best believe I'ma get it right back 
 It's the hustler in me I know you like that 
 You probably think I'm with a different broad every night 
 When I think about it shit man you're probably right 
 The more I think about it shit you're probably wrong 
 'Cause what you didn't think about it... 
 She said, she said, you ain't no good, no good 
 But if you feel so good 
 She said, she said, what if I could? 
 But I gotta leave you alone, ah 
 She said I gotta leave you alone 
 I, she said, I know you bad 
 But I want you bad 
 She said, she said, makes me so sad 
 That I gotta leave you alone 
 I said, I gotta leave you alone 
 She said she wish she never met me 
 'Cause she can't just help but let me 
 Go ahead do whatever the hell you want 
 She said she hate how much she need me 
 Turn around, and say she don't need me 
 Always talking about she gonan leave me 
 But she don't 
 But maybe this time I'll be different 
 'Cause she shed so many tears 
 She'll remind me all the dumb shit that I've done all over the years 
 But she don't be tripping in the morning, I got her legs up by her ears 
 But as soon as we get done, I swear this is all I hear, yeah 
 She said, she said, you ain't no good, no good 
 But if you feel so good 
 She said, she said, what if I could? 
 But I gotta leave you alone, ah 
 She said I gotta leave you alone 
 I, she said, I know you bad 
 But I want you bad 
 She said, she said, makes me so sad 
 That I gotta leave you alone 
 I said, I gotta leave you alone.
