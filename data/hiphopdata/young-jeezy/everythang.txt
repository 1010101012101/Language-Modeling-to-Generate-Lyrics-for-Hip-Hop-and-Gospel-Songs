I used to have nothing 
 But now I got a whole lot of everythang 
 And I come through stuntin' 
 And now the whole world gonna know my name 
 And I used to have nothing 
 But now I got a whole lot of everythang 
 That's why I come through stuntin' 
 When I'm gone, the whole world gonna know my name 
 Twelve years old, caught up in that street life 
 I was trying to shine harder than the street lights 
 Ran the streets tongue-tied, couldn't sleep nights 
 'Cause when you're living wrong, it's hard to sleep right 
 But it is what it is, gotta eat right? 
 Cop them things, they be whiter than your teeth right? 
 Dreamed some big things on my grandmama couch 
 Hid some big things at my grandmama house 
 'Cause when you play the game every strike counts 
 And why they call them 8 balls if they don't bounce? 
 Bag full of breakdowns in the backyard 
 But you can't get 'em out till it's backed off 
 I used to have nothing 
 But now I got a whole lot of everythang 
 And I come through stuntin' 
 And now the whole world gonna know my name 
 And I used to have nothing 
 But now I got a whole lot of everythang 
 That's why I come through stunting 
 When I'm gone, the whole world gonna know my name 
 What it do nigga? 1 triple zero 
 Who you gonna be nigga? Neighborhood hero 
 Dope game, no shame, nigga, more pain 
 See them enough to drive a young nigga insane 
 From the windows of the trap, see the prison bars 
 Flashing lights on top, we call them prison cars 
 For my niggas make a living on they mobile phone 
 Grind hard till your earrings cost a mobile home 
 Ain't nothing wrong with that, get your mobile on 
 Get the bricks butt naked, get your Stroker's on 
 All the other bullshit I could have focused on 
 Said, "Fuck that shit" and kept my focus on 
 I used to have nothing 
 But now I got a whole lot of everythang 
 And I come through stuntin' 
 And now the whole world gonna know my name 
 And I used to have nothing 
 But now I got a whole lot of everythang 
 That's why I come through stuntin' 
 When I'm gone, the whole world gonna know my name 
 Yeah, they try to stop a nigga but I won't let 'em 
 See the wheels? How the fuck you ain't gon sweat 'em 
 Bet you one thing, bet you niggas won't bet 'em 
 G5 take off, you know I'm gon' jet 'em 
 Road trips ain't shit, you know I go get 'em 
 Plus my man send his check, you know we gon' split 'em 
 Now so many shoes that I can't wear 
 From that real nigga cloth, that's why you can't tell 
 Always knew that I'd make it out someday 
 Traffic jam, I was going down the one-way 
 Twelve used to hit the block, I had to run away 
 Now this nigga be flyin' in the runway 
 I used to have nothing 
 But now I got a whole lot of everythang 
 And I come through stuntin' 
 And now the whole world gonna know my name 
 And I used to have nothing 
 But now I got a whole lot of everythang 
 That's why I come through stuntin' 
 When I'm gone, the whole world gonna know my name
