All the hoes jockin', beat steady knockin' 
 Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin' 
 Nigga you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin' 
 Bet she can't do it on a dick, she poppin' 
 We bottle poppin', you cock blockin' 
 Told ya gurl you rap, but ya CD floppin' 
 You say you gettin' money man, we ain't seen nothin' 
 Ya gurl is persistent, she ain't stoppin' 
 Man she say she want a hood nigga 
 I keep the purp by the pound 
 The trunk stay bumpin, y'all know we run the town 
 Hood nigga 
 And I keep a bad bitch around 
 Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown 
 Hood nigga 
 And my Chevy sittin' on 24's 
 Flats look like flapjack, pancake you ain't know 
 Hood nigga 
 I'm a play the game how it go 
 They can take me out the hood 
 But I'm a keep it hood folk 
 And I don't need a scale for the work 
 I can eyeball purp, I am not you jerk 
 Hatin' on me will make your situation worse 
 You don't wanna take a ride in that long black hearse 
 All eyes on me, shawty I'm a bomb first 
 I'm the truth and they say the truth hurts 
 Hustle mean hard work, hard work 
 If you scared go to church 
 Man this rap shit is easy, every beat I get I murk 
 'Cause I'm a hood nigga 
 I keep the purp by the pound 
 The trunk stay bumpin, y'all know we run the town 
 Hood nigga 
 And I keep a bad bitch around 
 Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown 
 Hood nigga 
 And my Chevy sittin' on 24's 
 Flats look like flapjack, pancake you ain't know 
 Hood nigga 
 I'm a play the game how it go 
 They can take me out the hood 
 But I'm a keep it hood folk 
 Get like you, naw, get like me 
 Eveesus we don't rock white tees 
 Classic capris, but Knicks on my feet 
 Account with babe and apes, get a pair every week 
 Manasha 3, the gurls suck me to sleep 
 Z-o-e climax to the peak

 You'll see ICU fuckin' with me 
 'Cause I'm a hood nigga 
 I keep the purp by the pound 
 The trunk stay bumpin', y'all know we run the town 
 Hood nigga

 Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown 
 Hood nigga

 They can take me out the hood 
 But I'm a keep it hood folk 
 Watchin out for goldiggers like kanye, 
 But I will play beyonce, or ashantay, maybe kieshia cole, 
 Said she should've cheated if she eva come my way,
