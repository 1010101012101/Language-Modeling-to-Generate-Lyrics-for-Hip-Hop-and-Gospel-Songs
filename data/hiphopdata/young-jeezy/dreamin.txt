This one for the hood right here 
 Song dedicated to anybody out there that got some dreams 
 Don't give up on ur dreams real talk 
 Ready keysh, let's go 
 "Dreamin" (I must be) 
 Man I must be 
 Dreamin' ... dreamin' 
 Dreamin' (I must be) 
 Man I must be dreamin' ... dreamin' (yeah) 
 (Verse one) 
 Born September 28 
 My life far from great 
 No food on the table 
 So we far from steak 
 But I'm so close to jail 
 It feels like I'm so close to hell 
 Moms smoking rocks 
 Same shit I'm selling 
 So whos wrong 
 Her or me 
 She addicted to the high 
 I'm addicted to the cash 
 I almost put my hands on her 
 When I caught her in my stash 
 How could I do her like that 
 Lord knows I'm wrong 
 Why would I do her like that 
 Lord know she strong 
 I know it's been hard 
 But we made it baby 
 10 years clean 
 So she's still my lady 
 I must be dreamin' 
 "Dreamin" (I must be) 
 Man I must be 
 Dreamin' ... dreamin' 
 Dreamin' (I must be) 
 Man I must be dreamin' ... dreamin' (yeah) 
 (Verse two) 
 One thing about it 
 I got love 4 you hommie 
 Two things about it 
 I'll take a slug for you hommie 
 Look at you now 
 You're a business man 
 I'm proud of you dog 
 Handle your business man 
 You like the brother 
 I never ever had 
 You try your best 
 And I'd still get mad 
 We risked it all together 
 Been through it all together 
 Caught cases and we still together 
 Headed ot 
 I sleep while you drive 
 Me and my dog 
 Yeah we chippin on 5 
 Remember back when we 
 Shared our clothes 
 Look at us now nigga 
 We sell out shows 
 "Dreamin" (I must be) 
 Man I must be 
 Dreamin' ... dreamin' 
 Dreamin' (I must be) 
 Man I must be dreamin' ... dreamin' (yeah) 
 (Verse three) 
 I was young and dumb 
 Wit a pocket full of cash 
 Posted on the block 
 Wit a pocket full of glass 
 Full speed 
 Still runnin' from my past 
 But its starting to catch up 
 Yeah its gainin on my ass 
 There's two types of niggas 
 Predator and prey 
 I'm a predator 
 I pray 3 times a day 
 Mat lue once said 
 One day you'll have kids 
 And how you gon explain 
 All that shit you did 
 I'm a soul survivor 
 Far from a crook 
 She always said 
 I was a lot smarter than I look 
 So I took my dreams 
 And made it some thousands 
 And took my life and made it an album
