 I heard the hood up in here 
 Well let me hear ya

 Don't make me kill ya 
 I walk that, talk that 
 Been there, bought that 
 Dropped this, whipped that 
 Sold this, know that 
 Feds take pictures, so what kodaks 
 That don't stop sh*t, 
 More work, more stacks 
 More cars, more clothes 
 Good weed, more hoes 
 More choppas, more cash 
 In da maze, okay 
 No way jose', young price to high 
 No front, cash out 
 That's right, we buy 
 More clubs, more fun 
 More bottles, more guns 
 I rob no one 
 Please sit and have fun 
 [Chorus:] 
 Pass me my mic, (yeah)

 Tell 'em it's show time, 
 Tell 'em it's show time, 
 Tell 'em it's show time,

 Look at all these real n***as and they came to see me 
 Tell 'em it's show time,

 [Verse 2:] 
 Yeah the n***as hard, but I'm so much harder 
 They ask me how I made it, I was so much smarter 
 Gotta focus on your strengths, motherf**k your weaknesses 
 Ya'll know I stay hot, so why they know all my weaknesses 
 They say, oh he's so G, 
 Killed that slowly 
 My swag, my flow 
 Swagga jackers ya'll know 
 Beleive them you're dumb 
 There's only one young 
 Since there's only one young 
 The f**k these n***as come from 
 I know, They know I go so hard 
 I know, they know I'm really so hard 
 Full house, packed show 
 Bad b*tches, front row 
 Trap stars in the back, 
 87's full of stacks 
 [Chorus:] 
 Pass me my mic, (yeah) 
 Soundman get me right 
 I hope you n***as ready cause it's goin down tonight 
 Tell 'em it's show time, 
 Tell 'em it's show time, 
 Tell 'em it's show time, 
 Tell 'em it's show time 
 I got it packed front to back ooh wee 
 Look at all these real n***as and they came to see me 
 Tell 'em it's show time,

 Tell 'em it's show time, 
 Tell 'em it's show time
