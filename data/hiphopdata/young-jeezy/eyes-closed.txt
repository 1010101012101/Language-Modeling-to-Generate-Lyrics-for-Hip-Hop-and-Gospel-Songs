Ey, ey, ey, 2 pistols, ey, blood money, money 
 By all means instead of 2 beat, call me 
 Young triple beam, got fish scale, got oil base 
 Lawyer paid up, just in case I catch a sell case 
 Naw, I stuttin' them crackers, magician with the work 
 Call it dope, boy magic, dey he go, stunntin' again 
 With the top laid back put the dro in the wind 
 Oh, did I mention that I'm shyin'? 
 Blue, white, yellow, black, pink diamonds 
 (You already know) 
 That's my favorite line 
 If your shit shine like mine 
 You would say that all the time 
 Frostbit neck and my wrist froze 
 You can see my damn watch with your eyes closed 
 Blue, white, yellow, black, pink diamonds 
 Shawty shinnin', still grindin', shawty shinnin', still grindin' 
 I know they watchin', I pose for the photograph 
 Those indictment papers, hope you want my autograph 
 We don't trip, we just live live 
 Trying to dodge them handcuffs and them blue lights 
 Frostbit neck and my wrist froze 
 You can see my damn watch with your eyes closed 
 Ask them hoes with the extra blow 
 The nigga with the Louie luggage down in Mexico 
 In a A-town fitted cap, I'm so hot tower 
 I think I need a thunder stack 
 Give a fuck about a player hater 
 Hit him with the tool, flush his whole radiator 
 Frostbit neck and my wrist froze 
 You can see my damn watch with your eyes closed 
 Blue, white, yellow, black, pink diamonds 
 Shawty shinnin', still grindin', shawty shinnin', still grindin' 
 I'm 24 with 24 figures, 24 triggers, 24 inches 
 But I keep 'em clean so they pass for sixes 
 Stunnin' on you pussy ass niggaz 
 72' dope really straight shoot pass you 
 Flat screens, 18's, I don't herd shyt, pocket full of stones 
 I got 'em beatin' strong, threw my speakers bitch 
 Young boss shyt, oh, you didn't hear 4th generation 
 My granddaddy used to sell birds, who am I to fuck tradition up 
 I got my ass in the kitchen water with a Bentley chip? 
 200k off my block bitch, I, no you thinkin' rap 
 I'm thinkin' laundry mat, clean money homie 
 Frostbit neck and my wrist froze 
 You can see my damn watch with your eyes closed 
 Blue, white, yellow, black, pink diamonds 
 Shawty shinnin', still grindin', shawty shinnin', still grindin' 
 Ey, ey, ey
