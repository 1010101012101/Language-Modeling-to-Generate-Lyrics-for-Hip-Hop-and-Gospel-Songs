You see me I eat sleep shit and talk trap 
 You see the 645 I paid cash I bought that 
 Had some felony charges, I fought that 
 If I ain't a D boy then what do you call that? 
 Yeah ima big tymer like bryan Williams 
 But you can catch me in the hood eatn churches chicken 
 I been hot, y'all just caught the buzz 
 And I was fresh about the same time many was 
 Grab a snickers this may take a while 
 Been chasin cash money since I was a juvenile 
 And I was worth a couple thou still in high school livin' @ my momma house 
 Call it masturbation the way I feel myself 
 So I started my own label and I signed myself 
 I ain't lookin' for no artists 'cause I'm fire myself 
 And I'm guaranteed a job I ain't gonna fire myself... 
 Listen Young Buck I know its evident 
 Round here we'll kill yo ass over 50 cent 
 You betta run nigga you bteta save yo ass 
 'Cause its guaranteed to be a shady aftermath 
 He in his v12 eatin M&Ms 
 Dark tinted windows but you know it's him 
 Who? 
 I seen him just the other day 
 Word on the street he just signed with jazzie fay 
 And showty spittin' flames y'all 
 Bet you a whole brick he bout to change the game y'all 
 And them otha niggas can't compete 
 'Cause that nigga from the streets 
 Yeah I'm 'bout it 'bout it but I ain't Master P 
 And it ain't no limit if you fuck with me 
 Nah nigga, I neva heard of you 
 But I still have my nigga C to murder ya 
 Make the same profit as I did wit D 
 With the keys on the triton and a _ 
 Real smart a genius in the kitchen 
 So when jeezy talk niggas listen 
 It ain't all good 
 It ain't all bad 
 All that shit they drivin' I already had 
 And I know it make them lames mad 
 'Cause the chicks they lovin' I already had
