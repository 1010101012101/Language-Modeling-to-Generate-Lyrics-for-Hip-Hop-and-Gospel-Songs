Yeah (yeah) 
 I said yeah nigga 
 Yeah (yeah) 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm tripper 
 I'm trippin' nigga 
 (Verse 1: young jeezy) 
 Look what the fucks up heard it's going down 
 Headin to my bitchs house on the other side of town 
 Plus that remy got my head going round and round 
 100 mils a hour and I'm smellin like half a pound 
 As soon as I hit the door she coming out her panties 
 Got a nigga excited like I won my first grammy 
 I'm a boss motherfucker I do it b.i.g 
 Tell king kong he ain't got shit on me 
 87 head to toe I got that shit on me 
 And yeah your girl a real rider she like to sit on me 
 I told her all the sites zone you can chill on me 
 And I don't want your bitch holmes so you can chill on me 
 And if the nigga insecure then you can count on young 
 100 percent guarantee he won't get sprung 
 He was blowing up our phone and she was on my lap 
 The way she was blowing up my bomb I almost forgot my strap 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm trippin' 
 And I don't know why 
 I'm trippin' them all my fault 
 The way I'm switching on these nigga they call me flip mode 
 Why 'cause I bust them out then I dig 'em out 
 Then I roll a spliff then I kick 'em out 
 Got my rider bra I ain't bring the kittens out 
 'Cause I ain't nervous when a nigga bring the spitters out 
 They I'm trippin' I say chill baby calm down 
 So you just standing there teacher get the man down 
 That nigga trippin' don't he call himself young o day? 
 Plus I don't play I let it spray I'm all about my pay 
 And if you think I'm trippin' fuck you have a nice day 
 And while you think I'm trippin' I'll be trippin' to the base 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm trippin' 
 I'm trippin' 
 And I don't know why
