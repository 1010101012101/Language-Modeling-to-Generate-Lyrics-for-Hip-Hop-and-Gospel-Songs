Twenty six inches remix killer, 
 Weezy f the god, 
 Yeah godzilla, 
 I'm on dat bob Marley, 
 I'm in a Ferrari, 
 I mean a Ferrari, 
 My flow is so firey, 
 I'm hotter than the sun, 
 Just call me a Amare (Stoudmare), 
 I'm the soul heiry, 
 Whatcha know 'bout it, 
 Young money baby, 
 Co sign it, 
 Young money cash money we are so giant,

 Birdman Jr., 
 Mind that bird, 
 Always strapped, 
 Combat first,

 Always strapped up never put dat strap down, 
 Haha, 
 Young mula baby√¢?? 
 Pussy gon get pussy, 
 C.M.B., Weezy, Birdman, Ross, purple car, 
 Purple green, white work, polyurethane, 
 Dat girl brain got her IQ, 
 Her daddy in a chain gang claim pyru, 
 She wanna look at me, I wanna look at her, 
 I run with cash money, go head and look it up, 
 Only the best grade tryin' to light it up, 
 Spend a night with me baby you could write a book, 
 I influence so many, g-5s, I flew in so many, 
 We so hot, so and so finished, 
 We globe trot onto more business, 
 Two steppin in my chucks, always strapped you know what's up, 
 Triple C you know dats us, C.M.B. you know dats us. 
 Young Jeezy Always Strapped lyrics 
 So good you can smell it through the roof, 
 If you getting money throw your hood out the roof, 
 You know it ain't a remix without the band man, 
 Fliest nigga in the club he got on his man bands 
 Why he call bag man because he got them bands 
 Would have called him gram bands if he had them grams in em, 
 Leave nothing at the crib I got it all on, 
 And I ain't leave nothing off I got it all on, 
 So I ain't trying to be rude, niggas ain't shit, 
 They just trying to be dude, niggas ain't this, 
 Pull up in something so stupid, like what ya think? 
 Damn shades so dark I can't even blink, 
 Left the street with bad habits I can't spill my drink, 
 Fuck around and have a flashback, I might need a sink, 
 I get it in I go hard, that's my own broad, 
 Fuck critics, straight cash that's my gold card, 
 Always black, I'm in black always, 
 Always strapped, yeah I'm strapped always.
