I relate to niggas and dey relate to me 
 Real niggas do real things that's how its supposed to be 
 Cut from the same cause, made da same shirt 
 Prolly had the same blood and got the same work 
 I'll wack ya ass 
 Skip to the N.O. 
 And lay low in the projects with my kinfolk 
 A-K 47 with the shoulder strap 
 Set it off have it soundin like the Nola Clap 
 Got 2 strikes nigga dodgin one time 
 This is real life you got the nerve to call it punch line 
 Well I got a punch line for ya 
 You ain't talkin' bout sh** I wanna see my lawyer 
 Gangstas, Street Niggas, Real Gangstas, Street Niggas [2x] 
 F*** da style dey jockin my swang 
 Imma real street nigga we are not the same 
 I'm grown nigga so play witcha own kids 
 I'm old nigga so getcha old ass here 
 One white girl left save the last dance 
 My partner said he want it so dis ya last chance 
 Funny how a nextel will getcha 50 years 
 Co defindent makin' deals like you work at sears 
 Still posted at the Amercoat 
 Judge givin' cash three numbers like at Amercoat 
 Play the game how it go F*** what a nigga thank 
 'Cause under pressure a nigga change like chamillion paint 
 Gangstas, Street Niggas, Real Gangstas, Street Niggas [2x] 
 White sh** in my attic and I ain't talkin' sheep rock 
 Dey killed a nigga around the corner now the blocks hot 
 Blockbuster night glocks poppin' like popcorn 
 Folks comin' through shakin niggas like popcorn 
 Niggas soft like hot butter and dey might talk 
 Consession stand ass niggas love to drop salt 
 Imma street poet let me paint a picture 
 First of da month tryna get dis scrilla 
 Couple O's over here couple O's over there 
 Gotta whole one stash in my livin' room chair 
 Dude never smile ain't sh** funny 
 G's in Maguire 
 Show me the money 
 Gangstas, Street Niggas, Real Gangstas, Street Niggas [2x]
