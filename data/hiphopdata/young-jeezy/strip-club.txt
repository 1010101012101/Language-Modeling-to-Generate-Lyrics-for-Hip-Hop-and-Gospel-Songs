 Life is like a strip club 
 When you spendin all your money then you get love 
 When you run up out of ones then you throw dougs 
 When you spend up all your money ain't no love

 Like them girls bottoms man they wanna see me drop 
 Bitch nigga fuck y'all ain going no where 
 You can take it all off bitch I ain't gone stare 
 Looking so good got that ass read up
