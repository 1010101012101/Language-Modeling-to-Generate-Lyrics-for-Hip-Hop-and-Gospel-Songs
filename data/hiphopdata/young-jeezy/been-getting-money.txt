Had a mill at 16 know how that felt? 
 And I'm still kicking shit, bitch black belt 
 Shoulda seen me in that yella 4-30 
 Got it washed everyday, bitch never seen dirty 
 Told me meet him at the waffle house, he got a clean .30 
 On my Domino's shit, only took a mean 30 
 My folks always on time yeah I'm talking (???) 
 I'm in something low-key (???) 
 Steady mobbing be the game 
 Cut the music down cause my cellphone ringing 
 From what I just heard think my cellphone dreaming 
 Wasn't doing this I'd probably be a politician 
 Fuck first forty-eight just too much snitching 
 'Cause I ain't pulling over be a whole lotta arresting 
 What? 
 Ain't a damn thing change now 
 'Cause I been getting money 
 Who you know pulled up 
 Black cars drewed up 
 With the big-faced hundreds 
 Put them things on the road now 
 Nigga still getting that dough now 
 Niggas think I lucked up, must got me fucked up 
 'Cause I been getting money 
 And just when I thought it couldn't get no better 
 Nigga hit me on my chirp, got all my cheddar 
 All wondering why I got this shit runnin' like a shower 
 Big bag full of white, you woulda thought it was some flour 
 Work hard in the kitchen like a culinary school 
 I be doin' my thang, I'm a culinary fool 
 So much Pj, I was pissin that shit, talkin' bottles so big put a fist in that shit 
 You were born that way, always be a hater 
 Don't (?) on these hoes, always be a playa 
 (???) Shoulda been a calculator 
 I'm so cold with this shit, (?) refrigerator 
 Jewelry store, green bob bought my first Cartier 
 Threw 'em 30 thou and got the fuck up outta there 
 That's how jo jo (???) one day got indicted 
 If it's a party with the feds, I ain't tynna get invited 
 Ain't a damn thing change now 
 'Cause I been getting money 
 Who you know pulled up 
 Black cars drewed up 
 With the big-faced hundreds 
 Put them things on the road now 
 Nigga still getting that dough now 
 Niggas think I lucked up, must got me fucked up 
 'Cause I been getting money 
 Imagine (?) coming from the ceiling fast 
 Stack a hundred bills in your right hand 
 Right there by the couch bag of rubber bands 
 Gotta get 5, double stacked that's a hundred grand 
 Rose gold jacob, 4 units for the timepiece 
 Got my niggas working so much they need a timesheet 
 They thought it was a joke until I copped that 6 
 7: 45 pull up in that bitch 
 Ever see a nigga pop a hundred bottles for the club 
 (???), Get the money, get ya love 
 One song, blew a quarter chicken, yeah that's a (?) 
 If a nigga re'ing up with half a ticket that's a car quote 
 Ain't a damn thing change now 
 'Cause I been getting money 
 Who you know pulled up 
 Black cars drewed up 
 With the big-faced hundreds 
 Put them things on the road now 
 Nigga still getting that dough now 
 Niggas think I lucked up, must got me fucked up 
 'Cause I been getting money
