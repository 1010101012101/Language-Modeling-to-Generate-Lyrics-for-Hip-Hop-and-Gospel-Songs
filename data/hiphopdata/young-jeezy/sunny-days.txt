I'm killing these niggas man this shit ain't fair 
 Give me the death penalty the electric chair, 
 I'm in an electric coupe 
 With the electric roof 
 Its electric blue 
 With the electric top, Just gives me a rush yeah electric shock, 
 And that mother fucker Crip'N got that navy seats, 
 Catch me riding round town with a navy piece, 
 Got the FN rifle yeah that navy heat ha ha, 
 She gone off that goose told me call her cranberry, 
 I traded in the scale for a new blackberry, 
 I'm so confident damn right I'm so sure, 
 A hood nigga straight turned entrepreneur, 
 I'm killing these niggas 
 The games in trouble but helps on the way, 
 This for my niggas that move a brick every day (I am killing these niggas) 
 Still the realist nigga in it that's all I can say 
 When on the highway this is what you play (I am killing these niggas) 
 The games in trouble but helps on the way, 
 This for my niggas that move a brick every day (I am killing these niggas) 
 Still the realist nigga in it that's all I can say 
 When on the highway this is what you play 
 I gave 'em everything I had yeah that's all I got 
 And if that ain't enough then give me back my pot 
 Give me back my block, give me back my life 
 Give me back my days, give me back my ways 
 Why pay to get it catered I can chef it myself, 
 Why let 'em get the extras I can stretch it myself 
 62 bring a hundred back nigga what's happenin'? 
 I swear to God its even after you take it off the napkin 
 I done see more off white than a dentist, got a A in science class yeah I shoulda been a chemist 
 Or Young the veterinarian I play with the birds 
 Still the realest nigga in it that's my motha fuckin' word

 Still the realist nigga in it that's all I can say 
 When on the highway this is what you play 
 I guess love go with hate that's apart of the game 
 Less water that you use yeah the harder the caine 
 Fuck bein positive man a nigga tryna live, 
 Now my chain cost more than my fuckin' auntie crib 
 I know what you thinking that's a God damn shame 
 But a nigga ain't gave me a motha fuckin' thing 
 I stood out in the rain yeah I stood out in the heat 
 Niggas tryna short stop I'm in the middle of the street 
 The preacher told me I'm going down the wrong road 
 But now I ride good up and down the same road 
 Kept my spot in the hood even got the same stove 
 And I'm still iced out so I got the same cold 
 I am killing these niggas 
 The games in trouble but helps on the way, 
 This for my niggas that move a brick every day (I am killing these niggas) 
 Still the realist nigga in it that's all I can say
