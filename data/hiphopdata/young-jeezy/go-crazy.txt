(Cannon) 
 Guess whos bizzack 
 Still smell the blow on my clothes 
 Like crispy cream I was cooking them o's 
 Like horseshoes I was tossin them o's 
 Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow 
 I'm emotional 
 I hug the block 
 I'm so emotional 
 I love my glock 
 Cash rules everything around me 
 So what's realer 
 'Bout the scriller so call me a ghost face killa 
 Its kinda hard to be drug free 
 When george and pie wont give a n***a lights free 
 Switched hustles been killin' 'em ever since 
 Been paid to tell the truth it only make sense 
 When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy 
 And watch the dope boys go crazy 
 I pop my colar then I swing my chain 
 If you catch me in the club pimpin' doing my thang 
 When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy 
 And watch the dope boys go crazy 
 They pop my colar then they swing they chain 
 All the gangstas in the street that be doin' they thang 
 Wont stop till my whole team in thug mansion 
 And I sell like pac 
 That's a thugs passion 
 And this the realest shit I ever wrote 
 And all eyes on me like a microscope 
 Young jeezy give 'em one more chance 
 They try to spit like you and get your whole advance 
 Like my main man pulla talk real slick 
 Look I'm ok but my watch sick 
 You don't gotta like a n***a 
 Just respect my mind 
 This is how I'm eatin now 
 So respect my grind 
 The way I put them words together 
 Reminds me about how I put them byrds together 
 Buy 18 the hard way 
 Now have a younger n***a thinkin' bout gun play 
 Now who the fuck wanna play with guns 
 Alotta hoes alotta drugs dog 
 That shit ain't fun 
 So I suggest that you don't play with my chain 
 Or ill send these hollow's at you 
 Let them play with ya brain 
 The streets is watchin 
 The name is warn 
 The products white 
 A star is born 
 Pimpin' I'm so fly 
 I take this parachute off 
 I might fall and die 
 Wrap the work with spandex with the latex 
 Then we ship it outta town 
 Call it safe sex
