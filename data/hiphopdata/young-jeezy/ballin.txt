(Young Jeezy - Chorus) 
 You think you're ballin cause you got a block? 
 He think he ballin 'cause he got a block? 
 You know these hoes came to see me ball 
 You know these hoes love to see me ball 
 You think you're ballin cause you got a block? 
 He think he ballin 'cause he got a block? 
 You know these hoes came to see me ball 
 You know these hoes came to see me ball 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 These hoes call me Tunechi baby 
 N-ggas think they seeing me, they hallucinating 
 Bitch, I'm balling, ballin' like a muthaf-cker 
 12 gauge, bitch, I got a dozen of them 
 N-gga broke, acting like he got it though 
 I'm with a Spanish bitch, if she ain't f-cking, adios! 
 So many cars I'm like eenie meenie minie moe 
 So many colours in the diamonds, Kaleidoscope 
 Last year I made a hundred million dollars flat 
 Run in ya house, get to poppin' at your shower cap 
 My homies got them firebirds like Pontiac 
 And if them bitches don't sell, we buy 'em back 
 Where the strippers, tell 'em Tune on his way 
 Tell them n-ggas I'm strapped like lingerie 
 I ain't trippin', I'm ballin, call me NBA 
 I-I ain't trippin', I'm ballin, call me NBA 
 (Young Jeezy - Chorus) 
 You think you're ballin cause you got a block? 
 He think he ballin 'cause he got a block? 
 You know these hoes came to see me ball 
 You know these hoes love to see me ball 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 You think you're ballin cause you got a block? 
 He think he ballin 'cause he got a block?
