(Drake) 
 I said tell me what's really going on 
 Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happening 
 Gon for surgery but now I'm back again 
 I'm bout my paper like a muthf-cking scratch and win 
 World Series attitude, champagne bottle life 
 Nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night 
 I will have a model wife your b-tch is as hot as ice 
 Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice 
 (Drake you got 'em right) 
 Yeah I got 'em Bun 
 I love myself because I swear their life is just not as fun 
 Neks got the weed, Hush got a gun 
 CJ's got my credit cards and a lot of ones 
 Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple sprite 
 Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire she should work tonight 
 Call her King of Diamonds and tell China it'd be worth the flight 
 I'll be at my table stacking dollar's to the perfect height 
 Work something twirk something basis 
 She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked 
 I don't judge her, I don't judge her 
 But I could never love her cause to her I'm just a rapper 
 And soon she'll have met another 
 That's why me and lil jazz bout to spaz can you keep up 
 I'm just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up 
 Yeah bills everywhere, trill everything 
 And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything 
 I love Nicki Minaj 
 I told her I'd admit it 
 I hope one day we get married just to say we f-cking did it 
 And girl I'm f-cking serious I'm with it if you with it 
 Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted 
 Uh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment 
 Like I catch 'em stealing flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it 
 And Life ain't a rehearsal the camera's always rollin' 
 So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin' 
 'Cause it's on... 
 (Chorus - Drake) 
 Yeah girl it's on 
 You know what it is when I finally make it home 
 I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone 
 Yeah I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone 
 And you just tell me what you down for 
 Anything you down for 
 I know things have changed 
 Know I used to be around more 
 But you should miss me a little when I'm gone 
 I just hope you miss me a little when you're gone 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 Ooh sh-t, 
 Muthaf-cker God Damn 
 Kicking b-tches out the Condo like pam 
 Getting money everyday I'ma ground hog 
 Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball 
 I walk light so I don't piss the ground off 
 Man I swear my b-tches do it till they suck the brown off 
 Erghhhh, that's nasty 
 Yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic 
 James Bond cologne, hunny I put on 
 Make 'em run and tell there frineds like a marathon 
 Voice baritone haters carry on 
 Beat the p-ssy up, call me Larry Holmes 
 Young Money's Jerry Sloan 
 I turn every stone 
 "When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song 
 To women I condone better write me when I'm gone 
 No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone 
 Uh, I'm a love machine 
 And I won't work for nobody but you 
 It's only me and her because the Bugatti coupe 
 Its blood gang slam but I party with Snoop 
 I ain't lying I shoot 
 You don't need signs for proof 
 Turn you to a vegatable like you lining soup 
 And when I'm in the booth, sh-t the lion is loose 
 Man I got so many styles I am a group 
 Damn, I'll be gone till November 
 F-ck it I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill em' 
 I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim 
 I'mma say it if the rules ain't bent don't bend em' 
 Real n-gga talking 
 Shut the f-ck up hoe 
 Gotta do it one time for Haiti, wattup zoe 
 Weezy F Baby and the F is for Front do' 
 Cause that's where I bring it, 
 So wu if you bang it, mothaf-cka 
 (Drake - Chorus) 
 Yeah girl it's on 
 You know what it is when I finally make it home 
 I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone 
 Yeah I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone 
 And you just tell me what you down for 
 Anything you down for 
 I know things have changed 
 Know I used to be around more 
 But you should miss me a little when I'm gone 
 I just hope you miss me a little when you're gone
