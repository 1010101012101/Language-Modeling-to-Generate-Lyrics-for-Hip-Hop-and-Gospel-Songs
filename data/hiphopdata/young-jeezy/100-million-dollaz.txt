I'm from da ghetto da bottoms da hood da slums 
 Money out here we just tryin' to get some 
 Cool like Dre nigga A like K 
 When ya talk about me you better watch what ya say (Whoo) 
 Don't ever keep dem thangs where ya lay 
 'Cause dem pussy ass niggas show da folks where ya stay 
 Ya thought he was ya dawg said he was a G 
 Sounds like anotha' code fiend to me 
 Niggas move sloppy and I really don't like it 
 Fuck around and get everybody indited 
 Saw dis shit comin' you woulda thought I was a psychic 
 Fuck around go dead broke tryin' to fight it
