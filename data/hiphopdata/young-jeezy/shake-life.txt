Got a million on my mind while I'm brushing my teeth 
 Say the hustler's prayer than I'm back to these streets 
 Got a million mothafuckas throwin' salt on my name 
 A million mothafuckas throwin' salt on my game 
 Can't hear you bitch ass niggas yeah I'm sorry 
 Too busy switchin' these gears on my Ferrari 
 Roof do gymnastics, shit's like magic 
 Life like traffic, this shit here classic 
 Worked the Nino Brown, went to chill in the Bahamas 
 I was all in the hood, got some head in the Bahamas 
 Why you smokin' 'bout a zip? It suppress my pain 
 Talk about a real nigga when you mention my name 
 I'm a simple man, want the money, fuck fame 
 While you stay the same, everybody else change 
 Oh no but I'm going out tonight though 
 And drink till I'm fucked up like them white folks 
 I know it look bad, it's gon' be all right 
 Keep them bottles coming we gon' be here all night 
 Roll them swishas up, we about to take flight 
 Need a set of new dice yeah, I'm 'bout the shake life 
 'Bout the shake life, yeah I'm 'bout the shake life 
 'Bout the shake life, yeah we 'bout the shake life 
 And live every night like it's Friday night 
 Need a set of new dice, we 'bout the shake life 
 I'm 'bout the shake life that's word to my momma 
 The work come in, yeah it's on Your Honour 
 Give me all the time in the world and I quote 
 You give me a hundred years but I won't be broke 
 When you broke, treat you like a bad joke 
 Niggas laugh at you when they know it ain't funny 
 Government playin' round with everybody money 
 Got us brainwashed so we all big dummies 
 War in these streets everyday like Libya 
 Will I get shot in the head? It's like Trivia 
 CNN tryna get us to hate all the Muslims 
 Them niggas never talkin' the truth so don't trust 'em 
 Niggas out there die about true religion 
 Young niggas over here dying over True Religions 
 So fuck it all, shit, I'm going out tonight though 
 Drink till I'm fucked up like them white folks 
 I know it look bad, its gon' be all right 
 Keep them bottles coming we gon' be here all night 
 Roll them swishas up, we about to take flight 
 Need a set of new dice yeah, I'm 'bout the shake life 
 'Bout the shake life, yeah I'm 'bout the shake life 
 'Bout the shake life, yeah we 'bout the shake life 
 And live every night like it's Friday night 
 Need a set of new dice, we 'bout the shake life 
 Supposed to live everyday just like it's your last 
 Smile at these suckas while you spending your cash 
 Ball till you fall, how long it's gon' last 
 The only thing that matters is how long is your cash 
 So holla when you see me out stuntin' in these cars 
 When you looking at a nigga do you niggas see my scars 
 Stab me in the back, that's right the game cut me 
 I got it all but lost all my dogs, the game fucked me 
 Some in cemeteries, and the rest got 30 
 Why I'm so clean tonight 'cause life dirty 
 These jockin' ass rappers tryna jock my fresh 
 Remind me of seventh grade, when they was jockin' my Guess 
 I ain't gonna lie, shit I had it back then 
 8 for an O, I can least buy 10 
 So fuck it all shit, I'm going out tonight though 
 And drink till I'm fucked up like them white folk 
 I know it look bad, it's gon' be all right 
 Keep them bottles coming we gon' be here all night 
 Roll them swishas up, we about to take flight 
 Need a set of new dice yeah, I'm 'bout the shake life 
 'Bout the shake life, yeah I'm 'bout the shake life 
 'Bout the shake life, yeah we 'bout the shake life 
 And live every night like it's Friday night 
 Need a set of new dice, we 'bout the shake life
