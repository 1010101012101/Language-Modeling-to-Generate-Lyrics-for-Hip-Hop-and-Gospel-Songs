(Yeah) (Say I Do It All Again) 
 Chrous: (2x) 
 You know I grind, straight hustle, hit licks, 
 Get 'em break 'em down, weigh bricks 
 Late night count it up talk shit, 
 That why I had to drop one for the streets right quick 
 (Jeezy) 
 Four one two fives two on the counter 
 What's the scene? one triple beam 
 Two money counters two fifties dem five hunrdeds 
 They in the plastic oil thangs them one thousandths 
 They in the attic. 
 Yellow shit that have you itchin that instant linchin 
 What ya say it's too short that's Walter Payton 
 Get it right that's fifty six that thirty six 
 Twenty eight that's times two that's plenty six 
 Fifty six a quarter short that's seven Vicks 
 Residue up in the wrap that's evidence 
 Yellow water its hella water that's what it took 
 Drop the price its twenty five that's reggie bush 
 Back to Chorus (2x) 
 (Slick Pulla) 
 Do it all again hell yeah you know I would 
 I almost lost my life puttin' this chrome under the hood 
 I damn near lost it all for these cars and these jewels 
 The D.A. tried to make the case thick like glue 
 Trials, tribulations, you know we heard 'em boss 
 We don't eat beef burgers you know we burnin those 
 The microwave will get it done but I prefer the stove 
 All black civic hatch back now I'm on the road 
 Made the play and came back now I gotta fresh sack 
 Four hours there four hours back 
 Had to get that road cash residue on the stacks we just call it 
 Blow cash 
 In the streets pickin' chins that's better than no cash 
 Back to Chrous (2x) 
 (Yo Gotti) 
 Brickz of white, fields of purple 
 Ima landscaper, construction worker 
 Mr. Kool-Aid drinker, pitcher purple 
 Mr. he so real, break bread with his circle {yo goootttii} 
 Straight thuggin', straight hustling 
 White, whole thangs for twenty nothing 
 What it do sixteen, seventeen, I'm talkin' fish that purest shit you ever seen 
 I'm talkin' murder first 48 crime scene I'm talkin' me the realest nigga {yo goottii} 
 You ever seen, in my life is all I know, I can't pretend you lock me up, let me out and ima do it again 
 Back to Chorus 2x 
 And I do it all again 
 End...
