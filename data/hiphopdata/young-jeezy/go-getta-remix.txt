 Let me see I can break them down and take long on the slow sail 
 I'm a chill for a minute and sit on it on the whole sale 
 Business is just fine 
 None of your folks tell them shouldn't have it any other way 
 When you're coke selling 
 I don't know what it is guess we was raised different 
 Blowing haze standing on the couch and ____ dripping 
 Air force is hard then I'm a low ____ B block 
 Your boy kiss is a go getta
