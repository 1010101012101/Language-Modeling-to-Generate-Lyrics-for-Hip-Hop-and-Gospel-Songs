 I see you Zipo... I got ya homie 
 No mo jose no mo rosie 
 They locked my dog up and that ain't ro-zay 
 All he wanted was the fame make it last forever 
 You get some ones I get some ones we make it rain together 
 I'm talkin' Quabo dreams cristal fetishes 
 Smokein' everyday just to keep ya sanity 
 Just me and nigga like what up doe 
 Still partyin' the club closed an hour ago 
 I guess the back to back Lambo's a thing of the past 
 We used to talk on a chirp now we talking through a glass 
 Just like the glass I know he sees right through me 
 Transparent I can't hide my window pain 
 I'm thinkin' what to say to make him have a betta day 
 I'm walkin' down this lil hallway like what the fuck I'm gonna say 
 As I'm walkin' down the halls I feel the stress in the walls 
 I need to lighten up man this shit is too tense 
 Feels like I need? my heart aches so bad 
 When he sees my face he's gonna be so glad 
 Then I look into his eyes swear to god I seen his soul 
 Tell me what can make a hot boy stare so cold 
 As I looked a lil deeper I saw a lil hope then he cracked a smile 
 He still got his pride 
 Keep doin' what you doin' hold us real nigga's down 
 No matta what you do don't let us real nigga's down

 And yet so much yell of my sence of smell and I don't mean that literally 
 But I mean this literally these nigga's actors me I'm a factory 
 Known for movin' big money shit at least a tractor 
 No breaks no tires I'm a ride for these streets Yeah till the wheels 
 Fall off

 Hustle still stackin' dead presidents They say he on his way out well that's a 
 Reasonable doubt ain't no nigga's like the ones I got friend or foe politics as usual
