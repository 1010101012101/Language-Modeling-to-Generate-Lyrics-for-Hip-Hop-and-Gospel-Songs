 : 
 You scared 
 Scared money don't make no money 
 You scared 
 Scared money don't make no money 
 You scared 
 Scared money don't make no money 
 Don't make no money, don't hate no money 
 Young Jeezy 
 : 
 I ain't never been scared 
 You heard what I said 
 If anything look, I'm over prepared 
 They on that bullsh-t they don't want no bread 
 It's like tellin' a bad b-tch I don't want no head 
 Not me I tell that b-tch to go ahead 
 And when she done what she doing, I tell that b-tch to get bread 
 Done doing that I tell the b-tch to get dough 
 Done doing that I tell the b-tch to get mo? 
 Welcome to the mind of a hustler a straight skitzo 
 I am never scared of the money I got my pistol 
 I am never scared when the block hotta than crisco 
 Your hood, yay area b-tch just call it Frisco 
 So listen up, tell me, stop talking sh-t though 
 Silverado sittin' on thirties I call it tip toe 
 They say you no body till your ass in the feds 
 Can say the f-ck you want, you can't say that I was scared

 You scared

 You scared 
 Scared money don't make no money 
 Don't make no money, don't hate no money

 : 
 Young Mula in this mo-f-cka 
 I ain't never scared of the money call me bone crusha 
 Stick my feet in the dirt like a long jumper 
 And I wish a muthaf-cka wood, I chop lumber 
 I'm a hustle junkie, I'm a grind slave 
 More money than mistakes is what I've made 
 Money on my mind, I got my mind made 
 If money grow on trees, I'm tryna find shade 
 Sh-t, you n-ggas running from the money 
 And I treat it like pussy, see I got the money cumming 
 Scary ass n-ggas, I bury cash n-gga 
 Cream in my pocket, strawberry flag n-gga 
 Get the money first that's to every last n-gga 
 If you scared stay broke, gon get a cast n-gga 
 Scary money don't make no money, old pussy ass n-gga 
 I take your money 
 Uh?
