 That ride around you hood all day with your gun shit 
 All I got to my name is two bricks and one felony 
 Your going back to jail that's what my conscious keep on telling me 
 I really ain't buying all this nonsense they selling me 
 When the government throwing more curves than the letter C 
 I said the letter C I guess that's for correctional 
 They try to box me in, sit me still like a vegetable

 Even though the money slow we still spend it 
 In this crazy world

 In this crazy world and this dopes still selling 
 And these haters still telling

 Probably why I never give a fuck about a record deal 
 And I ain't never tried this shit imagine how that white feel 
 But that don't even matter though trying to pay the light bill, 
 Light bill, phone bill plus my granny nerve pill 
 Feel like I should be takin' em' imagine how my nerves feel

 And if I let her pass her children never will forgive me 
 Oh man another trap I think bush trying to punish us 
 Send a little message out to each and every one of us
