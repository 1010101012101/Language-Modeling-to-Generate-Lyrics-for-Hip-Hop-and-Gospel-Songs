Sorry fa Cussin 
 I'm back Mr. Magic City 
 Blow on color purp I make it rain on your forehead 
 You woulda thought a fan the way I blow that money 
 You woulda thought I had a plan the way I throw that money 
 (Jyeah) I'm (Jyeah) I'm (Jyeah) I'm (Jyeah) 
 I'm back Mr. Magic City 
 Blow on color purp I make it rain on your forehead 
 You woulda thought a fan the way I blow that money 
 You woulda thought I had a plan the way I throw that money 
 The Feds outside and they checking his tag 
 But still the boy move with a hell of a swag 
 It's like the soundtrack to my life 
 Everyday I'm under investigation 
 But I will not stop so you can stop the hating 
 What more can I say it's like my gift and my curse 
 To fell or succeed I don't know what's worse (shit) 
 I don't know what's worse (aaa) 
 Agents tryna find a glitch in my matrix 
 One slip and I'm back to the basics 
 Red or blue pill what would you do? 
 When the same niggas you love got hate in their blood 
 I know God's watching over me so is the Feds 
 When love turns to hate and niggas rather you dead 
 Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ 
 All that I've done will you protect my life? 
 Maybe, maybe not, until then I keep an extra clip for that Glock 
 You wanna see my bank statement; I got no problems with that 
 300 thousand you know I'm smarter than that 
 I been dodging the alphabet boys all my life 
 So you gonna need more than a child support lawyer (yep, listen up) 
 I got some child support for you, 
 Get off your ass bitch and get you a job 
 Tell your other 3 baby daddy's to sell dope or rob 
 My son got everything in this world that I never had 
 So one thing you can't call me is a deadbeat dad (nope) 
 When you're the one that shoulda been exposed 
 Unfit mother still playin' withcha nose 
 And I don't wanna tell my child that his moms ain't shit 
 And this ain't about him she just a money hungry bitch 
 I been here before, they boxed me in corna (whatcha do nigga) 
 And I came out fighting 
 They locked me in a cell and I came out writing (yeah, I say I came out wrtitin) 
 Lock my body you can't trap my mind 
 I only talk in the bedroom, we whisper in the kitchen 
 Call me paranoid I think the walls is listening (shhhh) 
 But if them walls could talk (what'd they say) 
 I probably never get to see the daylight 
 I gave it to 'em raw mixtape after mixtape (yeah) 
 I had niggas waiting on the album 
 I shoulda got five mics in the Source 
 Instead I got five bricks and a Porsche (haha) 
 They sat I ain't lyrical 
 I wasn't tryna impress y'all niggas 
 If hatin' was a crime they'd arrest y'all niggas 
 Kink bought the mic I just gave him my life 
 The streets co-signed the hood gave me my stripes 
 I said the streets co-signed the hood gave me my stripes 
 Kink bought the mic I just gave him my life 
 I said the streets co-signed the hood gave me my stripes 
 (Yeah I know you ain't done em) 
 I'm back, better than before 
 Matter fact I'm better than ever 
 They can't box me in, that boy too clever 
 So CNN worried bout little ol me 
 Fuck the bitch ass reporter whoever wrote the story (Fuck em) 
 You motherfuckers don't know shit about me (naw) 
 What I been through or where I came from (a) 
 When Shit got hard I stayed I ain't run 
 So you can blame the government they made me this way 
 See the pain in my eyes you don't? see me cry 
 Two tears in a bucket, who got that work? (who got it?) 
 Real Talk: I'll make us a way 
 Get rich or Ima go to jail tryin' 
 Uncle Sam ain't never gave me shit 
 But my partner out west, yeah he front me them bricks (ha ha) 
 How the hell you expect me to be drug free 
 When George Bush ain't never done shit for me 
 Follow me home and tap my phone 
 What happened to my freedom of speech? 
 Love don't love nobody, got me feelin' like 
 I shouldn't love myself 
 I practice what I preach, I preaches what I practice (yes) 
 A hundred thou unda my mattress (Let's get it) 
 I'm only human, just a man 
 God gave me a gift to do the best that I can 
 Critics say I can't make an album better than my first one 
 The way I feel that'll probably be my worst one 
 The other one after that will better than my last 
 So real talk y'all can kiss my ass 
 This is the beginning of the beginning 
 I am the future (say what) 
 You niggas are a thing of the past 
 I'm not ashamed of who I am or what I've become 
 So all that ridiculing man I'm not the one 
 It's called self respect I bow down to no man 
 I say all that to say You Can't Ban The Snowman
