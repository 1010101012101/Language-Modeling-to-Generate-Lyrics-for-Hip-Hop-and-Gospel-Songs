Cause I get a lot of that (I get a lot of that) 
 Put your hands in the air if you get a lot of that (if you get a lot of that) I get a lot of that 
 Put your hands in the air if you get a lot of that 
 Let's talk about hate 'cause I get a lot of that 
 Talk about money 'cause I get a lot of that (I get a lot of that, I get a lot of that, I get a lot of that,) 'cause I get a lot of that 
 Let's talk about hate 'cause I get a lot of that 
 Talk about money 'cause I get a lot of that (I get a lot of that, I get a lot of that, I get a lot of that,) 'cause I get a lot of that 
 This can't be it man this shit too stressful 
 Is that what it is I'm just successful, 
 Maybe I'm too good to hood low down no good 
 I just keep shit real just like you should 
 Twist my fingers throw up my hood 
 Let's get this money I know I would 
 I know that's right but still we do wrong 
 J-bo got dirty but still we moved on 
 Get them clamps out 
 Get my groove on 
 I stay iced out 
 Get my cool on 
 Best be cool homes 
 Get my goon on 
 I'll bust them two's homes 
 Get my lose on 
 They say young fell off yeah the boy done lost it 
 Been porting all my life baby I'm just exhausted 
 I take a Gatorade break to get everything straight 
 Now I'm sitting here like how much Gatorade make? 
 How much money would it take to make some more money? 
 Damn right a nigga straight come get some mo' from me 
 I sold millions made them millions 
 But still y'all doubt me what's this without me? 
 Can't be that bad still got my trapp swagg 
 And every time I do a show I leave with a trap bag 
 Money in trashbags 
 I call that garbage 
 Twenty pounds in a trash bag 
 That shit look like garbage 
 I get a lot of that a lot of this 
 I mean a lot of it 
 Sit on my bedroom floor counting all of it 
 That money be Ludacris 
 It just might shock you 
 If you can't find shocker then my right hands keep it 
 Look I am simply on of the best 
 Can't even lie I can't vouch for the rest 
 Just like zip lock they get killed in the plastic 
 Best add five grams as if you weighed it in plastic 
 I am so dirty they wrap me in plastic 
 When they wrap me in plastic need to put me in traffic 
 They say that I'm difficult even different 
 Show me the difference I'll bring you the difference
