It's M.C. and Y.J. 
 Another hit, okay 
 We lookin' fine, takin' off 
 Saw us on a runway 
 On any given Sunday, 
 Monday, Tuesday (haha) 
 They try to confuse me, 
 I never let 'em use me 
 I was a girl, you was a man 
 I was too young to understand 
 I was naive, I just believed 
 Everything that you told me 
 Said you were strong, protecting me 
 Then I found out that you were weak 
 Keeping me there under your thumb 
 Cause you were scared that I'd become much 
 More than you could handle 
 Shining like a chandelier 
 That decorated every room 
 Inside this private hell we built 
 And I dealt with it like a kid 
 I wished I could fly away but instead 
 I kept my tears inside 'cause I knew if I 
 Started I'd keep cryin' for the rest of my 
 Life with you I finally built up the strength 
 To walk away don't regret it 
 But I still live with the side effects 
 Wakin' up scared some nights 
 Still dreamin' 'bout the violent times 
 Still a little protective 'bout the people 
 That I let inside 
 Still a little defensive 
 Thinkin' folks be tryin' to run my life 
 Still a little depressed 
 Inside I fake a smile and deal with the 
 Side effects 
 Side effects 
 Side effects 
 Side effects 
 Vacant inside no one was there 
 Couldn't be real, had to keep quiet 
 Once in a while put up a fight 
 It's just too much night after night 
 After a while I would just lie 
 You were dead wrong said you were right 
 Did what I could just to survive 
 Couldn't believe this was my life 
 Flickering like a candle 
 Doin' my best to handle 
 Sleepin' with the enemy 
 Aware that he was smothering 
 Every last part of me 
 So I broke away and finally 
 Found the strength to breathe 
 I kept my tears inside 'cause I knew if I 
 Started I'd keep cryin' for the rest of my 
 Life with you I finally built up the strength 
 To walk away don't regret it 
 But I still live with the side effects 
 Side effects 
 Side effects 
 Side effects 
 Side effects 
 Hey Magnifico or should I say Magnificent? 
 Ain't nothing worth your happiness 
 And I ain't caring who you're with 
 Misery love company so we ain't tryin' to hang with y'all 
 Hurt you if you let 'em in 
 Gotta keep your circle small 
 Keep tryin' to play 
 I tell him I ain't blowin' tho 
 Think they want me outta here, 
 I tell 'em I ain't goin' tho 
 Side effects be drowsiness, 
 Loneliness, 
 How is this? 
 I think the call it hateration, 
 What can you prescribe for this? 
 Forgive but I can't forget 
 Everyday I deal with this 
 I live with the side effects 
 But I ain't gon let them get the best of me 
 Forgive but I can't forget 
 Everyday I deal with this 
 I live with the side effects 
 But I ain't gon let them get the best of me 
 I kept my tears inside 'cause I knew if I 
 Started I'd keep cryin' for the rest of my 
 Life with you I finally built up the strength 
 To walk away don't regret it 
 But I still live with the side effects 
 Side effects
