(J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League...) 
 (Verse 1: Young Jeezy) 
 Fuck these haters, I'd kill 'em all if I could 
 Ain't scared of none of y'all, so you know my aim good 
 Blowin' bin Ladie in my Porsche 911 
 Just left Ground Zero, on my way to kush heaven 
 Can't slow down, too much evil in my rear view 
 Sometimes you wanna scream to God, but he can't hear you 
 And even if you did, this'll probably be disaster 
 Fuck you 'plainin' 'bout? It ain't like you got cancer 
 Do it for my niggas on the block that got it worse 
 First the love, then the hate, that just a trap nigga's curse 
 I betcha feel like the whole world hatin' on you 
 But what's the hold-up? The whole world waitin' on you 
 (The fame...) 
 I wake up and feel empty 
 Shit make you wanna squeeze your glock till it's empty 
 I'm already standin' on the edge, so don't tempt me 
 Fake motherfuckers envy 
 (The fame...) 
 I wake up and feel empty 
 Shit make you wanna squeeze your glock till it's empty 
 I'm already standin' on the edge, so don't tempt me 
 Fake motherfuckers envy 
 (Verse 2: Young Jeezy) 
 You mean to tell me from runnin' my big mouth 
 That I could chill here in this big penthouse 
 All elevator'd up, black hardwood floors 
 Just to sit around and feel like it ain't yours 
 Your conscience gotcha feelin' like you done somethin' wrong 
 But the flatscreen say "Motherfucker, we on." 
 Pardon me, nigga, do you see this view? 
 See Ruth's Chris from here, what the fuck's wrong wit' you? 
 Lookin' at my Rollie, yeah, it's almost seven 
 Bill Gates state of mind wit' an automatic weapon 
 You might 'member from puttin' on for the city 
 Or back when it was on two, goin' for the fitty 
 Opened up a few squares, opened up a few tours 
 Just to show niggas keys open up doors 
 "Oh, we don't fuck wit' Young no mo'." Why not? 
 The only thing I can figure, 'cause he on top 
 (The fame...) 
 I wake up and feel empty 
 Shit make you wanna squeeze your glock till it's empty 
 I'm already standin' on the edge, so don't tempt me

 (Verse 3: T.I.) 
 What up, world? Long time, huh? 
 Hey, look 
 Lately, I been off and out of sight, seldom out of mind 
 Ay, getcha bidne' right, and stay the hell up out of mind 
 I'm out my mind, tryin' to fix it 'fore I'm out of time 
 Don't worry 'bout me, God got me, bruh, I'm doin' fine 
 Another year in prison, promise this is it for me 
 Tryna make it through the storm, should be makin' history 
 No feelin' sorry for me, keep ya pity and ya sympathy 
 Good or bad, take it like a man, whatever meant for me 
 How I did it make 'em hate my spirit, they wish they could kill it 
 And they'll take it however they can get it 
 Wanna see me fulla misery, walkin' wit' my head down 
 "Let's decapitate 'im, then we'll see if he can wear his crown!"
