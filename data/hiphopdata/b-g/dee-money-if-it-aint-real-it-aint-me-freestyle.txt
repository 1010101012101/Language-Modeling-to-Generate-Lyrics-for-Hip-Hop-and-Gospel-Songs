(Dee Money) 
 I Run up on ya block quick when I'm burning rubber, 
 A real nigga like a soulja, heat up in my knuckles 
 The same type a nigga that keep a pistol on my side, 
 A 44 on my waist and a chopper when I ride, stay posted 
 On the block like a light pole just standing there, 
 Waiting for a nigga to run up, and think he hard, 
 But first I shut him down like a grocery store gone 
 Outta business, and when the police come nigga that's 
 When I'm finished, disobeying all laws, disrepecting 
 No broad, A street type a nigga, A 13 year old boy, 
 Straight sprayin at you quick 
 Leave ya braind in the sewyer, either come at me 
 Strapped, And if you don't nigga u 
 Done, ya whole family gonna see me and ya 
 Block gon burn, and if ya friend want some 
 She gotta wait her turn, I ain't scared of nobody, 
 Nigga I fear no one but Jesus, I gotta keep 
 It real nigga, and I ain't got no reason, kinda 
 Like a star, when you see me fear me, rup up on 
 U niggas bust shots you can't feel me, listen 
 Up and listen careful, if you open and if ya 
 Click want some nigga I'ma bust open, 
 If you leave 'em unattented, I'll mess over 
 'Em playin' wit me nigga you'll get 
 Ya dome checked throughroly, I'll put 
 Ypu in a sleep like, no disrespectin 
 My section, and anything in my way 
 Best believe I'm wrecking, and if any 
 Nigga hatin' on me, then there's 
 Beef it will be, nigga I already told 
 Ya IF IT AIN'T REAL IT AIN'T ME NIGGA!
