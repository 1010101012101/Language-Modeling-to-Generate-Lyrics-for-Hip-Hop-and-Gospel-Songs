 Man, look here 
 My hood is kurupted with nothin' but killers and soldiers 
 Off top cut throaters, get crossed up, get fucked over 
 It's in a nigga nature to put that iron 
 Don't playa hate us 
 Get knocked off the map 
 Head fall off your shoulder in 'ya lap

 So, until I'm covered in white sheets 
 Shit is gonna be real, nigga 
 When I'm afiliated with beef 
 I keep it real with my real niggaz 
 They beefin' I donate steel to my real niggaz 
 No secret I'll splitta mill with my real niggaz 
 Get in drama kill or be killed with my real niggaz 
 Off top 
 All my niggaz bout they business 
 Hustle for the feddi first alternative is they riches 
 Bitch regard everything peddi 
 We shinin are so deadly 
 Don't checks snitches hate up throw 'em in ditches 
 Now, I'm the type that'll die for nigga 
 No matter how deep the water is 
 I'll ride for my nigga 
 I don't give a fuck 
 I'll give my last dime to my nigga 
 Save my heart 
 But keep it real at all times with my nigga 
 Look, that's for my nigga 
 If he on a murder charge 
 I'ma make sure he got no witness 
 Ya know without no witness 
 No way he can be convicted 
 While he down I'll handle business for 'em 
 My nigga real 
 If he want me to fuck his bitch it's on 
 He can call 24-7 ain't no limit for 'em 
 Nigga if I had to 
 I'd take a life sentence for 'em 
 ?? Jungel 
 On a wild life adventure for 'em 
 It don't matter

 'Cause I'm real 
 Oh, best believe I come and get you if I want you 
 Get caught wit' yo' draws down 
 Then lil' Geezy will funk ya 
 Never underestimate me just because ima youngster 
 I know a nigga named Turk 
 Leave ya' in the driveway dumpster

 Hard hitters, trill niggers, straight wig splitters 
 No soft niggaz my dogs play the game raw nigga 
 You'd be fucked up if you see half the shit a saw nigga

 Much love to my nigga gangsta still hard to kill
