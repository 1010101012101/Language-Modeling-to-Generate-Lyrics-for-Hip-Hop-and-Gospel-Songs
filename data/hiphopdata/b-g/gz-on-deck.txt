 Boy you know it when you see it

 The king on set 
 Ay boy you know it when you see it 
 Them G'z on deck 
 Them bitches at attention when the king on set 
 Nigga come in with that flex and jump up out and get checked 
 It ain't no disrespectin when the king on set

 You betta hit the deck when the king on set 
 We got them G'z on deck 
 And hit the deck when the king on set 
 (T.I.:) 
 Strap a slug on me mac 11 in the bubble coat

 First you tried to tell 'em homie hatas what are you lookin' fo 
 Cause once we start to let them go yo ass they gon be lookin' fo 
 Don't know what he took us fo 
 Never been a pusher so I don't know what they yellin' screamin fussin 'cause he's pushin fo 
 I ain't fend to talk let 'em walk like it's all good 
 Catch 'em slippin in the parkin lot and then it's all good 
 Got a couple block and a mask in the club box 
 He come out the club and his ass get seen 
 Got 'em linked out the window with the beam on set 
 Made up my mind I'm a kill him when I see him no sweat 
 Make a bet I ain't gon put his monkey ass on a shelf 
 And I don't need nobody help 'cause I can do this shit myself 
 In a triple-black chevy ride low keystep I hope this nigga ready 'cause he gon' see death 
 (B.G.:) 
 Now these niggas better move when the G'z comin' through 
 Never be afraid to shoot when you see them near you 
 All fellas in my crew, ain't no tellin' in my crew 
 Chopper city grand hustle is what they yellin' in my crew 
 I'm a veteran in the crew, livin' legend in my crew 
 I keep that desert eagle, lethal weapon plus 2 
 We gon beef what it do, man you know that I'm a ride 
 We can do it right here or we can take it outside 
 Everyday is homicide couple of bodies every night 
 We got half the population murder rate still rise 
 Ay bullets still fly write his name on the wall 
 I ain't even gotta do it I got goons on call 
 I'm a beast I'm a dawg you a bitch you a fraud 
 I'm a ride I'm a G you a snitch you a fraud 
 If you want it you can get it hit 'em all up in his neck 
 And in his head in his chest make sure that nigga wet deck
