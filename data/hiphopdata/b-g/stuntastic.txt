(B.g.) 
 What's happenin', n**** 
 B.Geezy, Baby, Mannie Fresh, n**** 
 Big Tymers, n**** 
 You know we be stun'n our ass off, ya heard me 
 (Bling, -ling, -ling) 
 You know me and my clique stand out 
 It's bling-a-ling every time we stick our hand out 
 Eyes can't take it - motherfuckers turn they head around 
 I gotta laugh 'cause the neck, too, look like a gla** house 
 Man, that ice the motherfucker 
 Don't forget the whip - twenty-inches and TV's 
 Navigation system, Dreamcast, all in the Bentley 
 Everyday of the week I be jumpin' in somethin' different 
 Bikes, Lexus Trucks - everyday I be switchin' 
 My big round, Baby, taught me how to lay my stunt down 
 Come 'round the corner once, leave, switch up, come back around 
 You know how it go down on a Sunday uptown 
 Wrist hangin' out the window of the Jag with the top down 
 Later on that evenin', corner pocket off the chain 
 But I advise you: don't come around without that thing 
 'Cause them vultures be out and believe they be jackin' 
 But they know I'm a made n**** - I still be stuntastic 
 (Chorus - 2x (B.G.)) 
 It's stuntastic 
 Straight out the plastic 
 If they got drastic 
 Big Tymers is off the heezy 
 It's ballerific 
 Cash Money gifted 
 It's very hard to look at them princess cuts 'cause they be glistenin' 
 (Baby) 
 I ride top-notch s***, n****, all the hot s*** 
 On a Sunday I pull out all my drop-top s*** 
 I be stun'n 
 Step in the club and buy the vault 
 I know them hoes be lookin' - that's why I play this game raw 
 It's just in me to be the n**** that I be 
 Call me Atrice, call me Bryan, Bubble, or B. 
 You know who I am 
 You know Cash Money my fam' 
 Who else could it be with me and Geezy spinnin' that Lam' 
 Rockin' that ice, poppin' that cham' 
 Jumpin' out in front a warehouse dressed in Hot Boy wear 
 Glock on my side - you know we ain't gettin' checked at the door 
 Get outta line, we leave a n**** brains on the dance floor 
 Back to the coffee cup and drop the ice 
 Shake it up 
 When it come out, it's gon' f*** your eyes up 
 Like I said last time: I don't need no introduction 
 I'm the number-one when it come down to the stun'n 
 (Chorus - 2x (B.G.)) 
 It's stuntastic 
 Straight out the plastic 
 If they got drastic 
 Big Tymers is off the heezy 
 It's ballerific 
 Cash Money gifted 
 It's very hard to look at these princess cuts 'cause they be glistenin' 
 (Mannie Fresh) 
 Lil' one, I been paid 
 Two-thousand-ten escalade 
 Did I tell you how the seats made 
 Crocodile and mink suede 
 I touch y'all n****s' arms with candy-coated choppers 
 I fed these hoes fettuccini while you was feedin' 'em whoppers 
 I could take the ugliest b**** and turn her into somethin' 
 And take a whack-ass track and have that b**** bumpin' 
 N****, Liberacci ain't got nothin' on me 
 I got one diamond, and one ring bigger than your whole future, g 
 Shorty, you ain't heard the news? I'm ridin' on twenty-twos 
 I take the groom bride and give that hoe the blues 
 My neck on another level 
 My life on another level 
 All right, you got a Benz - and, n****, I'm pushin' the space shuttle 
 B****, please 
 My bank account Hercules 
 (B.g.) 
 It's, zero, zero, zero, comma, zero, (comma), 
 Stop (stop), freeze (freeze) 
 (Mannie Fresh) 
 Whatever you got, lil' daddy, believe me - I been had it 
 It's just in my life and my nature and my way to be stuntastic 
 (Chorus - 3x (B.G.)) 
 It's stuntastic 
 Straight out the plastic 
 If they got drastic 
 Big Tymers is off the heezy 
 It's ballerific 
 Cash Money gifted 
 It's very hard to look at these princess cuts 'cause they be glistenin' 
 (B.g.) 
 N****, 
 We ballerific and stuntastic, ya heard me 
 Baby, Mannie Fresh, B.Geezy 
 You dig 
 Stun'n till we can't stunt no motherf***in' more, n**** 
 Reppin' till we can't rep no motherf***in' more, n**** 
 Huntin' till we can't hunt no motherf***in' more, n**** 
 From Lamborghinis to Bentley's to Ferrari's to Jaguars to Hummers 
 To whatever you got - we got it and then some 
 Ya heard me 
 From princess cuts to baguettes 
 To whatever kind of diamonds they got, we got it, n**** 
 It don't stop, ya heard me 
 Cash Money, n****, got the rap game on lock 
 How you love that 
 Baby, Mannie Fresh - they got that work, n**** 
 And I got that pistol under my shirt, n**** 
 Yeah slip up if you want 
 You get put sixty feet under the dirt, n**** 
 CMR-a, Hot Boys, Cash Money
