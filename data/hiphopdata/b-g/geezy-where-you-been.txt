(Ziggler the Wiggler talking with B.G.) 
 (Verse 1: B.G.) 
 I been on the road movin coke and slangin raps 
 Traveling putting Chopper City on the map 
 I know I'm a get it with other niggas 
 I'm the underdawg so they doubt a nigga 
 But the streets 'bout a nigga 
 I'm a uptown big dawg and everone baby left hangin' 
 I'm comin' back to getchall 
 And we gone do it like real niggas do 
 Not one maybach ten lac's comin' through 
 We all got bitches on 24's spinnin 
 That's how it's goin' down when a real nigga get it 
 That's why they holdin' back and they won't break bread 
 'Cause they already now how B.Gizzle gone play it 
 I'm a go in the hood bring 'em another route 
 All my niggas with bonds I'm a get 'em out 
 All my niggas with monkeys I help get 'em off they back 
 I done got ride of mine so we rockin' like that nigga 
 [Chorus: Ziggler the Wiggler] + (B.G.) 
 Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been 
 (Man I been tryna make a dollar out off 15 cents) 
 I heard Juve went back now is you goin' back 
 (You know Juve that's my dawg but I ain't rockin' like that) 
 Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been 
 (Man I been tryna make a dollar out off 15 cents) 
 Say Juve went back now is you goin' back 
 (Man Juve that's my dawg but I ain't rockin' like that) 
 (Verse 2: B.G.) 
 Man I know people who know people 
 That give me work on the strength 
 I don't even have to owe people 
 I know arabs that know arabs 
 They get work from overseas 
 I bring it on V.L. and on the ave 
 I'm off the block so I'm a hold it down 
 I'm gonna pump this white I'm gonna bump this brown 
 I'm gonna get it out the mud I'm gonna stand my ground 
 Nigga play me once I ain't backin down 
 Nigga fucked me once think he fuck in me again 
 I might as well go to jail and be a punk then 
 I got connects in Detroit Michigan 
 You coke price fucked up see yo boy and I'm fixin it 
 I be all in Atlanta Georgia 
 I still be hollerin at them haitians down in Miami Florida 
 I'm a hustler baby said he fired me 
 But that wasn't nothin' 'cause the streets hired me 
 [Chorus: Ziggler the Wiggler] + (B.G.) 
 Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been 
 (Man I been tryna make a dollar out off 15 cents) 
 I heard Juve went back now is you goin' back 
 (You know Juve that's my dawg but I ain't rockin' like that) 
 Geezy where you been man Geezy where you been 
 (Man I been tryna make a dollar out off 15 cents) 
 Say Juve went back now is you goin' back 
 (Man Juve that's my dawg but I ain't rockin' like that) 
 (Verse 3: B.G.) 
 I done had a one on one with Lil Wayne 
 Told him I got the game for him to do his own thing 
 I done had a one on one with Lil Turk 
 I told him kick that dope and we can make shit work 
 I done had a one on one with Juve to 
 I told him handle his business and holla when he through 
 Nigga know I'm a hotboy for life 
 But I ain't goin' back ain't no matter the price 
 I don't need no nigga, nigga need me 
 I'll jack him for I let him birdfeed me 
 I'm a fool with that pistol better ask around 
 If I'm broke I make niggas pay draft Uptown 
 I had coke make a fiend catch a cab Uptown 
 I told him on V.L. on the ave Uptown 
 It's 2004 if you real then you know 
 The streets is all mine Chopper City in the do
