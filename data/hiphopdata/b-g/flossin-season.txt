 Added six ties to my new machinery 
 Double are at the bar like it's no tomorrow 
 Pretty broads and we fuckin' these Superstars 
 Chrome Rims nigga ridding new Benz

 We bang niggas taking trips to the Banks 
 Hitting malls spending 20 g's like stars

 Jumping out Lex's and Hummer's showing off for my people 
 When I up in VIP they say that's a nice car 
 Bitches all in my face I can't even make it to the Bar

 Got Kart's on both of my pinkey's, ten thousand apiece 
 Today I might lay low with Kent I built my house in the East 
 Fuck that I going to play burban it's a thousand a suite 
 Big Tymer 2: 
 Who had a first Burban with a living room set 
 Who the only nigga you know that drive a Burgundy Jet 
 How many city's you knew named after me 
 It's going to be a bunch of them muthafuckas when I finish G 
 Now baby I know you missed us, 
 Big daddy light up a room like Christmas 
 Shine like a light bulb rich thug 
 Let that little girl come over here and give a millionaire a hug 
 Magyver ain't liver than a Big Tymer 
 Big Dick a million dollars and a Pathfinder 
 Mr. Betty Crocker cake maker casino breaker 
 Tell Shaq I got a half a mill riding on the Lakers 
 Pack my bitches up and move to the hills 
 Thirty days a month thirty Automobiles 
 The Lexus and Benz come out in the year two thousand 
 I got one of them bitches parked around corner round housing 
 The bike I got come out in the year two thousand ten 
 Eleven fifty zoop with the batman fin 
 The ring I got Liberace want it 
 He couln't afford that bitch but I can afford to flaunt it 
 Chorus till song ends
