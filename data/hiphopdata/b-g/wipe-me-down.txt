Hey! 
 Mr. wipe down, ya heard me 
 Foxx-a-million 
 This one be the remix! 
 Bad ass, Savage life, Foxx-a-million 
 Man, you already know what it is; ya heard me 
 We still on, we still ridin' on chrome, we still pullin' up 
 (Foxx) 
 I pull up at the club, VIP, gas tank on E 
 But all drinks on me (Wipe me down) 
 Fresh kicks, fresh white tall tee, fresh NFL hat 
 Fresh bauds wit' the crease (Wipe me down) 
 Pussy niggas wanna hit me wit' they heat 
 Real recognize, real, real niggaz gon' speak (Wipe me down) 
 Jiggalatin', I been rollin' 'bout a week 
 You can tell I got cake by the diamonds in my teeth (Wipe me down) 
 Black shades, so you know a nigga rollin' 
 They ain't check me at the door 
 So ain't no tellin' what I'm holdin' (Wipe me down) 
 Bad bitches - they gon' bust it wide open 
 Niggas flashin' they lil' bread 
 But I'm the nigga they approachin' (Wipe me down) 
 Small nigga, tall figures, y'all niggas crowd niggas 
 We gon' get mac elevens and dog niggas (Wipe me down) 
 Y'all niggas call niggas, but my niggas all killas 
 Get ya issue and whoever fall wit' ya 
 'Cause I'm on (Wipe me down) 
 'Cause I'm on (Wipe me down) 
 'Cause I'm on (Wipe me down) 
 'Cause I'm on (Wipe me down) 
 'Cause I'm on (Wipe me down)

 B.O.O.S.I.E. B.A.D.A.Z.Z. - that's me (Wipe me down) 
 Red bones, caramels - all of 'em stop and stare 
 All of 'em try and steal my underwear (Wipe me down) 
 Like to floss like Rick Ross 
 Got a hit called set it off 
 When I sing it, everybody set it off (Wipe me down) 
 Black mink, I'm, yeah, I'm on play wit' me 
 I bust ya dome, eight whips on chrome; you can (Wipe me down) 
 Fresh fade, fresh J's on the corner 
 Playin' spades, I'm an ordinary person, but I'm paid (Wipe me down) 
 Foxx flippin', Webbie smokin', and we chokin' off a whole pound 
 Of purple famous like the Ninja Turtles (Wipe me down) 
 Just left New York City, hooked up wit' P. Diddy 
 Finna blow past fifty; you gon' have ta (Wipe me down) 
 We the best; I'm a fool, I'm the hemi man 
 Red light, green light, yellow light; get it, man? 
 (Webbie) 
 Hot drop, drop top, top drop hos drop it like it's hot 
 Yeah, nigga, I'm the shit (Wipe me down) 
 You see this ice on my wrist, how it glist? 
 Soon the light hit you; can't lie, the ice sick (Wipe me down) 
 Purple got me smellin' funky, red monkey 
 Five hundred dollars on 'em; you ain't seen these yet (Wipe me down) 
 Beatin', you can hear me way around the corner 
 Paint wet wit' the twenty-fours on 'em; that's bet (Wipe me down) 
 Ol' lady's baby mama's few fiance nigga's wife 
 Savage life, who I'm gonna fuck next? (Wipe me down) 
 And I don't use the Lifestyle or the Magnum or the Trojan 
 I'll go 'head and use the barrel of the tech (Wipe me down) 
 Man, this chain hit me for a couple grand 
 Oh no, I ain't complainin'; just watch how you wipe my chest (Wipe me down) 
 A bad bitch wanted me to stay lil' longer 
 I put that dick up on her, but I had a flight to catch (Wipe me down)
