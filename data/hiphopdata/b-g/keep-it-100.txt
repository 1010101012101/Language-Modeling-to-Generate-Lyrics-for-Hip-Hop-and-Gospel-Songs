Listen buddy, I'mma true definition of a G 
 I'mma legend of the block, what they know bout' me? 
 I'mma keep it 100, I'mma keep it 100 
 In the hood with a big chain fallin' from my neck 
 Money fallin' like my pocket full a chopper on deck 
 I'mma keep it 100, I'mma keep it 100 
 I'mma keep it 100, baby, that's no lie 
 So I'm throwin' up the finger every time I ride by 
 I'mma keep it 100, I'mma keep it 100 
 Hold up, look, now I'm the definition of what they call hot 
 I started at the bottom, I'm finishin' at the top 
 You know who it is, just walk the block 
 Where I'm from you should never get caught without the glock 
 If you do then you slippin', if you slippin', you got 'em 
 If you slippin' you stupid, you need to be shot 
 I roll with real niggas, if we said we done it 
 I can't fuck with you at all if you can't keep it a 100 
 I can't fuck with you at all if you ain't about gettin' money 
 I be thuggin' in public and 'em hoes love it 
 I'mma hustler, triple OG 
 I never let the money or the fame change me 
 Listen buddy, I'mma true definition of a G 
 I'mma legend of the block, what they know bout' me? 
 I'mma keep it 100, I'mma keep it 100 
 In the hood with a big chain fallin' from my neck 
 Money fallin' like my pocket full a chopper on deck 
 I'mma keep it 100, I'mma keep it 100 
 I'mma keep it 100, baby, that's no lie 
 So I'm throwin' up the finger every time I ride by 
 I'mma keep it 100, I'mma keep it 100 
 Hold up now 
 Just 'cause you blinged up don't mean you changed up 
 That just certifies a nigga that came up 
 I fill the bank up, you fill the safe up 
 Them K's on deck in case you niggas play dumb 
 You know I'm G'd up, you know I'm soulja'd down 
 Rest in peace, Soulja Slim, he told me to hold it down 
 So I'mma hold it down and I'mma keep it trill 
 I ever whatever I'mma keep it all the way real 
 I get it how I live, man, I don't give a fuck 
 Four ounces in the drank, hundred dollar cup 
 I smoke real good kush, hundred dollar blunts 
 Look in the parkin' lot, hundred thousand dollar truck 
 Listen buddy, I'mma true definition of a G 
 I'mma legend of the block, what they know bout' me? 
 I'mma keep it 100, I'mma keep it 100 
 In the hood with a big chain fallin' from my neck 
 Money fallin' like my pocket full a chopper on deck 
 I'mma keep it 100, I'mma keep it 100 
 I'mma keep it 100, baby, that's no lie 
 So I'm throwin' up the finger every time I ride by 
 I'mma keep it 100, I'mma keep it 100 
 These other dudes frontin', these other dudes stuntin' 
 They ain't 'bout nothin', I'mma keep it a 100 
 Gotta keep it a 100, I'mma keep it a 100 
 Gotta keep it a 100, I'mma keep it a 100 
 These other dudes frontin', these other dudes stuntin' 
 They ain't 'bout nothing, I'mma keep it a 100 
 I'mma keep it a 100, gotta keep it a 100 
 I'mma keep it a 100, gotta keep it a 100
