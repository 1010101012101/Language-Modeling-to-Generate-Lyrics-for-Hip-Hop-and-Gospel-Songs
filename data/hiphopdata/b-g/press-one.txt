 B.G: 
 "Greetings Hotgirl, what's happening on your end? 
 As for me over here, you know, a lil'chillin' 
 Besides that Sweetie, I'm just keepin' it real 
 Puttin' up with these crackers in this hot ass field 
 But you know I'm a soulja, nigga try me and I spank 'em 
 But fuck, all I said was, 'it feels good to be the baby gangsta' 
 Tell momma I asked about her, since she say I don't holla 
 And when I touch down, me and her gonna get a bottle 
 Shorty, I've been hearing that you been wiling out 
 Everyday of the week, tearing the club doors down 
 What's happening with you Woty? you throwing that pussy round 
 Doing this for the lil time that I'm not around 
 Don't get the game twisted, you better not try your luck 
 You know I ain't the one, quickly I'll fuck you up." 
 (Press one to accept) "I'm in a messed up situation" 
 (Press one to accept) "I'm in a fucked up location" 
 (Press one to accept) "The whole world can relate" 
 (Press one to accept) "Its from somebody upstate" 
 That one minuet that I had, done turned into a second 
 I got a day and a wake up left, and I'll be steppin 
 Straight through them iron gates, puttin' all this behind me 
 Come in the hood on the 'L' and you will find me 
 Hoppin out of limos, poppin' bottles its gravy 
 I know what it means when I get that phone call from Baby 
 Lets go to the mercedes, lock and cock something 
 A hard top six, or a drop top six, that would be lovely 
 My Shorty thinks, she has 6 more months to play 
 Can't wait to see that dick look up on her face 
 Right now I'm with the fellas, I'll go see her lata 
 'Cause she tries to be a slick ass playa 
 But I ain't trippin', its cool, I gotta respect it 
 A s long as she don't get out of line in my presence 
 She still my shorty, gone be my hoe 
 Can't forget that she was there everyday of my joust 
 Now its about that time, I go fuck up her dome 
 'Cause she has no idea that this Hotboy home 
 It ain't been a day, and I'm already on crome 
 I'm trying to imagine her face and how long that it's gonna be, 
 When I hit the porch, 
 And put my soulja Ree's through her front door 
 When she still thinks that I have 6 more months 
 I'm creepin' down the block, slowly I pull up 
 Jumped out, said "What's up" 
 She laid up there and threw up 
 "What's wrong, don't act like you don't miss ya nigga" 
 She said, "I do, I'm shocked," "Come over here and kiss ya nigga 
 I had to come surprise you, because you pissed ya nigga off 
 You don't respect me pussy poppin' on nobody's walls 
 You my main bitch 
 My travel with cocaine bitch 
 Set a nigga up, you wanted this position, so maintain bitch"
