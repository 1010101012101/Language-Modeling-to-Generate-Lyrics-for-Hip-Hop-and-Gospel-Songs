(Intro: B.G. Talking) 
 What's hapnin mayne (what's hapnin) 
 Say, I got my game up 
 You know what I'm sayin' so 
 I need y'all to get y'all game up 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 If you ridin' 20s I want you to go on do 24s 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 If you got a pinky ring on one pinky 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 Go head slap a pinky on the other pinky 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 If you got 5 karats in your watch 
 Go on head on and put 10 karats in there, mayne 
 Help me to get ya game up 
 Get ya game up 
 Ya heard me 
 (Verse 1: B.G.) 
 If you know me than you know I'm a beast 
 If you know me than you know I don't be lyin' when I tell ya I gotta cheat 
 If you know me than you know I'm a G 
 If you don't want your ol lady to get fucked don't bring her around me 
 Man, I'm hotter than you ever will be 
 Dawg I'm realer, just cooler, so smoother than you ever could be 
 I always put the hood in my rap 
 'Cause I ride through the trap, no strap, hoe face in my lap 
 I'm a man I be holdin' my own 
 Disrespect me if you want and I could promise you a whole in ya dome 
 I'm off the block when they play for keeps 
 And I was taught don't ride wit a nigga who ain't solid wit me 
 You got somethin' to say then say it to me 
 Don't talk behind my back, be a man homie brang it to me 
 Don't trip cause Gizzle done came up 
 Please, stop hatin', start paper chasin and get ya game up 
 (Chorus: B.G) 
 Get ya game up 
 Nigga get ya game up 
 If it cost less than 10 then put that chain up 
 Get ya game up 
 Nigga get ya game up 
 If it cost less than 10 then put ya chain up 
 Get ya weight up 
 Nigga get ya weight up 
 You see me comin', you stuntin man pick ya face up 
 Get ya weight up 
 Nigga get ya weight up 
 You see me comin', you stuntin man pick ya face up 
 (Verse 2: B.G.) 
 Look, I went from broke to rich 
 Rich to back do' 
 Broke then back to gettin' 20 thousand a show 
 I went from weed to dope 
 Dope to speed ballin' 
 Cleaned myself for me I'm a fuckin' moneyholic 
 Hoes just love how I carry myself 
 I look in the mirror sometimes and wanna marry myself 
 I be lookin' when a nine got this swag to myself 
 Most of it came from my daddy, a lil' Slim left 
 I'm a fool from the UPT 
 When I ask Hot Girls, What it do 
 They say do it to me 
 I'm official anywhere on the globe 
 I could travel around the world in 30 days with 30 different hoes 
 Man, I'm back and I'm outta control 
 Man, I'm floodin the bank until they see they can't hold no mo' 
 Don't trip cause Gizzle done came up 
 Please, stop hatin', start paper chasin and get ya game up 
 (Verse 3: B.G.) 
 I ain't a mobbster, but Gizzle is made 
 I'm a tell ya, real niggas respect the game 
 Bustas feel played 
 Real niggas can go in hood 
 Cause real niggas do what they want, bustas do what they could 
 On the real, I'm like the law of the streets 
 I could pull up, hop out, and leave my keys in the car on the streets 
 Nigga know what come behind fuckin' wit me 
 Mo' murder, mo' kill, mo' headbussin' fuckin' wit me 
 So I advise you to stay on your level 
 Niggas stay in your place 
 Be smart just stay out the way 
 Dawg, just stay in your league 
 Cause its alot of lions, tigers, and bears 
 Runnin' through these trees 
 And believe, I'm the king of the jungle 
 I'm the coach of the team 
 I can't mess wit the scope and a beam 
 Don't trip cause Gizzle done came up 
 Please, stop hatin', start paper chasin' and get ya game up
