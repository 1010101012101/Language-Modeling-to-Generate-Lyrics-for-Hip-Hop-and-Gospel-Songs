On the block we got them choppers 
 We got them choppers in the car we got them choppers 
 We got them choppers at the club we got them choppers we got 
 Them choppers ain't no love we got them choppers we got 
 Them choppers 
 (B.g.) 
 Look chopper totin is my occupation set my 
 Ground I'm representing in this situation 
 Since I was young it been all about paper chasing 
 It was a trauma for niggas that been player hatin' 
 I don't give a fuck call it short ten years I was facing 
 Bitch wanted B.G.z to get out but that ain't bout natin 
 B.G. a livin' legend that represent the streets 
 TV's is what I'm watching while I'm in my Mercedes Jeep 
 I don't check niggas then splittin niggas 
 I'm thuggin' with project pat we all rich niggas 
 Presidential Rolex wrapped around my wrist nigga 
 Nigga hope after the show I'm fucking yo bitch nigga 
 Act like a nigga Cash Money like to shine nigga 
 Pay attention 'cause we hypnotize yo mind nigga 
 About my cash so I stay on the grind nigga 
 You want to war look I'm ready at all times nigga 
 Bout mine nigga get it right get it right 
 (Baby) 
 What you say B.G.z these niggas better get it right 
 Everybody stay in line 
 Niggas totin gats and breakin backs but 
 In 98 we shine 
 In 99 it's nigga time 
 And I'm gone get mine 
 Niggas incausterated doing time shouting fuck one time 
 Got limo tents with rolie's that gone line 
 Totin two nines shots from the front and behind 
 Let bitch niggas know they can't take mine 
 I'm using my mind 'cause I'm enhancing doing crime 
 And you gone hear it in all my rhymes 
 I'm moving bricks to set tricks making sure 
 Every hoe I fuck with suck my dick 
 My baby momma could miss me with that bullshit 
 I want the money, a rolex, a 99 roles royce kaneice slick 
 Niggas bettin shoutin how you luv that? These other 
 Niggas keep stealin but I don't understand that 
 Not fucking these hoes with Project Pat 
 Nigga tell me how you love that tell me how you luv that 
 (Project Pat) 
 I'm yo dawg Project Pat ghetto section A housing 
 Stomach pain growling got me on the prowling 
 Streets got me wildin backstabbers smilin' 
 Now I'm catchin checks for some hundreds and thousands 
 I'm housing these bitches man dope try to down me 
 Grew up in the hood so you hoes better crown me 
 Get from round me I'm a thug be beside me (out of state) 
 Want to show love but they know they can't know they fake 
 When I touch ya dome won't be shit funny 
 Like Baby and B.G. I want that Cash Money 
 The fast money I'm addicted to this fast life 
 Just like a drunk I'm smoking crack out that glass pipe 
 Yo ass might as well try to jack yo momma 
 I never had shit to run up and cacth troubles 
 A real nigga ya step ya die see yo ass 
 Rather try crack before you try me
