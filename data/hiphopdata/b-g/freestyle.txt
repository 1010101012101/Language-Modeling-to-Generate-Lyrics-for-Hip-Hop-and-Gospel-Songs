I only buy shit when its less a price 
 You don't never get cake unless I gets a slice 
 Yeah these boyz already know what I like 
 When I hit niggas with two then I just go down they pipe 
 Never get hoes that always be annoyin 
 I say shake that ass when I throw them a coin and 
 Sometimes I bust low in the dark 
 And sometimes I kep p my baby-boy below in my car 
 Yeah Bam-Bam yo ass gone be ditching 
 How can you get sea-sick when we need hooks to go fishing 
 You see my doe so you think I robbed a bank 
 I make these hoes suck my dick then I give them a rank 
 Whoever said slobs can wup crips you a liar boy 
 We make are own rules call us the biker boyz 
 You see a nigga come up and then you say its basic 
 I don't fuck with lames or them butter-faces 
 See me and my boyz we a run threw the mob 
 Rocking black white and grey 
 You know it's the Hit Squad 
 So nigga respect my job 
 Respect thes blue niggas and never respect a slob (Squad Up)
