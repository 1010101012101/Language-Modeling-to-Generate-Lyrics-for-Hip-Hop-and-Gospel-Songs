(B.g.) 
 I try to maintain keep my head straight 
 But my surroundin' niggas want half weight 
 So what the fuck all I see iz niggas heads peeled 
 I ain't got to many positive relatives people 
 Try to tell me right from wrong but man I think 
 I'm grown I ain't resepctin no nigga 'cause my daddy gone 
 I'm on my own so let me be the b.g. I'm gonna be 
 It's an possiabilty I might see a key off valence 
 Street all I want is green in my hand I ain't gonna 
 Say nothin' because shit doesn't always go as planned 
 I'm gonna do what I do wit my hustlin 'cause I know 
 Somewhere out here they got a mill I'm gonna get it 
 I ain't waitin on the bitch to come to me 
 If that's the case I be waitin till eternity 
 I'ma struggle and strive drink some wine 
 Doin' bad thas fine I got my hand on my nine 
 You bests believe I'm goin' to get mine 
 You can take this to the bank nigga I'm gonna die tryin' 
 Chorus: b.g. 
 Playa can't be played 
 Playa niggas sittin' around waitin on shit to happen 
 But if ya want somethin' do what ya got to do, gee out chea 
 And make yo shit come through playa 
 (B.g.) 
 I gots to get mine I'm out for me 
 Nobody worryin' bout dis little b.g. 
 I'm gonna get my hustle on I'm in it to win it 
 I ain't my own man sittin' round dependin' 
 I'm the next nigga to take care of me 
 Thas weak I wouldn't be showin' responsibility 
 I'm gonna handle my own weight wit my own skills 
 Make my own mill backed up by the next nigga grill 
 Build me an hand hand I'm gonna play it right 
 To choices to rock the mic on my all night flight 
 One way or another success is in my future 
 If ya talk stupid playa hatin' I'm a mute ya 
 I'm gonna struggle till I make it sustle till I make it 
 I know I'm gonna make it because I'm tru to the game 
 No fakin' niggas wonderin why they can't stop dis b.g. 
 Standin 5'11 weighin 153 from the streets goin' full speed 
 To the stars nigga layin down raw smokin' big phat cigars 
 Nigga I got my hands on my nine I told ya 
 Take this to the bank nigga I'm gonna die tryin' 
 (B.g.) 
 Nigga I'm all bout da paper been a hustler for life 
 Always lay down and get mine even if I got to hang all night 
 It's like they got to wait for you, they got to wait for me 
 If I got to bust in disgust I'm gonna provide for the b.g. 
 I got this million dollar talent and it's all in my mind 
 I'm gonna work it overtime, I gots to get mine 
 I hit the block wit real niggas, block cock wit real niggas 
 Goin' to the top wit real niggas you get chopped from real niggas 
 I got skills for double platium I'm an habbit like dat 
 I pack my gat wit nine put my mac for nine niggas flat on dey back 
 Sellin crack for nine I'm tryin' to make somethin' 
 Shake get a big break I ain't fake

 It's cool because I'm a real nigga all about da mail 
 Get the scale weigh the yay got eleven for sale 
 Belive I don't mind dyin' make a million 
 I'm tryin' stuck in the hood nigga out to get mine
