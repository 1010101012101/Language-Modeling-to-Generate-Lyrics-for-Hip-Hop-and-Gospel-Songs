Yeah, yeah, yeah... 
 I know my wrist be dancin' crazy 
 Been on some fly shit lately 
 Used to be so damn patient 
 But now it's fuck you, pay me 
 Can't let these motherfuckers phase me 
 Never let that money change me 
 Ain't the way my mama raised me 
 Don't mean to brag but can you blame me? 
 200k and VVS, yellow diamonds 
 They wanna run up but they won't ever find me 
 Sit right next to the F&N, motherfuck the government 
 Sit down and I'm plottin' 
 100 bands on my body 
 Fuck with them boys, catch a body 
 Lil mama just want my pocket 
 'Rari take off like a rocket 
 Hol' up, you too close 
 I don't know, I don't know ya' 
 Had to run it, run it up 
 How I roll, how I roll, ya' 
 It's like after you pop off 
 They all act like they know ya' 
 And Young Post be like potluck 
 And they all love to blow ya', yeah 
 I know my wrist be dancin' crazy 
 Been on some fly shit lately 
 Used to be so damn patient 
 But now it's fuck you, pay me 
 Can't let these motherfuckers phase me 
 Never let that money change me 
 Ain't the way my mama raised me 
 Don't mean to brag but can you blame me? 
 200, swerving, dippin', dodge on the highway 
 You may contain me but you won't ever stop me 
 On the way to my residence 
 Try message your boo again, she pullin' up prolly 
 Yeah, sturdy inside of that Bentley 
 Yeah, come take a tatt on my Bentley 
 Yeah, people actin' too friendly man 
 They tryna get dividends, this shit is a problem 
 Yeah, you just be talkin' shit but ain't ever met me 
 Bet you know, fucked your bitch and now you resent me 
 I know them people but they don't represent me 
 Them wastemen, we gonna make 'em all pay 
 They will never stop the plan 
 80 jumpin' off my hand 
 Rollin', rollin', rollin' 
 Bust it open 
 Holy moly 
 I know my wrist be dancin' crazy 
 Been on some fly shit lately 
 Used to be so damn patient 
 But now it's fuck you, pay me 
 Can't let these motherfuckers phase me 
 Never let that money change me 
 Ain't the way my mama raised me 
 Don't mean to brag but can you blame me?
