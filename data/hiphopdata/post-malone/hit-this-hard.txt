 Don't do that, I tell you so 
 Don't overdose... Like no, no, no 
 Oh my god, what have you become? 
 The traces of you, no I can't see them 
 What have you become? 
 What have you turned to? 
 What have you taken? 
 Like someone hurt you 
 Yeah, drink that mixture 
 That shit gon' hit you 
 No, I can't fix you 
 No, No 
 Ouuu, yeah 
 I ran through, yeah 
 I feel the change in the air tonight 
 I saw myself in a different light 
 (I never felt that it would hit this hard) (x5) 
 I just keep running and running and running around 
 (I never felt that it would hit this hard) 
 The feeling is different (?) 
 (I never felt that it would hit this hard) 
 I don't know who (?) 
 (I never felt that it would hit this hard) 
 In the city we singing we don't ever want to come down 
 Me and J take over and we way up 
 Now high above the the city of angels 
 Smoke a bog in the sky, pass the fuego 
 I already dropped something in the favor 
 When we came to the club 'cause they paid us 
 Take this shit, lemme see what you're made of 
 No sleep little mama, we gon' stay up 
 Vampires in the night in Las Vegas 
 Ouuu, yeah 
 I ran through, yeah 
 I feel the change in the air tonight 
 I saw myself in a different light 
 (I never felt that it would hit this hard) (x5) 
 (x2) 
 I just keep running and running and running around 
 (I never felt that it would hit this hard) 
 The feeling is different (?) 
 (I never felt that it would hit this hard) 
 I don't know who I was (?) 
 (I never felt that it would hit this hard) 
 In the city we singing we don't ever want to come down
