She said "love me", so I loved her 
 She said "leave me", so I left 
 Then I went to California 
 And I ain't never coming back 
 I got a high-five from her brother 
 I got blood stains on the bed 
 And I ain't saying that I love her 
 But this bitch is gonna drive me mad 
 I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad 
 You got just what I've been looking for 
 But you can't bring yourself to say no 
 And I ain't never gonna let you go 
 I kept wishing I would die, oh 
 That whole plane ride home 
 And I wish I could 
 I know I should leave you alone 
 I worship since I met ya 
 I fell down to my knees 
 And when no one would accept ya 
 Throw myself up on the cross and bleed 
 I seen a dark cloud coming over 
 I seen some evil shit in her head 
 And when she rode me like no other 
 But this bitch is gonna drive me mad 
 I said this bitch is gonna drive me mad 
 You got just what I've been looking for 
 But you can't bring yourself to say no 
 And I ain't never gonna let you go 
 I kept wishing I would die, oh 
 That whole plane ride home 
 And I wish I could 
 I know I should leave you alone 
 You got just what I've been looking for 
 But you can't bring yourself to say no 
 And I ain't never gonna let you go 
 I kept wishing I would die, oh 
 That whole plane ride home 
 And I wish I could 
 I know I should leave you alone
