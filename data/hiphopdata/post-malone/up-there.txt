When I took a ride in the dead of night, told myself that everything was okay 
 Try to understand how you standin' over me, girl it's drivin' me crazy 
 Yeah, it's freezin' fuckin' cold in the dead of night, the only heat is comin' from the ashtray 
 I might as well get high as hell and just keep actin' like everything doesn't phase me 
 Yeah, take me all the way to the top baby 
 Don't even if I tell you to stop baby 
 Take me all the way to the sky baby, baby 
 I wanna go up there and I don't ever wanna come down 
 I wanna see what's up there, actin' like I got it all figured out 
 I wanna go up there and I don't ever wanna come down 
 I wanna see what's up there, must be better than the hell on the ground 
 It's freezin' fuckin' cold in the dead of night and I'ma drop the top with no [?] skrrt, skrrt, skrrt 
 And now my sound is realer, vamp it out, before the stop my chips never did fall in, backwoods 
 And I ain't religious but I look into the sky and I pray to anyone holy 
 I been drinkin' way too much and man I go the blues 'cause man, my baby don't hold me 
 Yeah, take me all the way to the top baby 
 Don't even if I tell you to stop baby 
 Take me all the way to the sky baby, baby 
 I wanna go up there and I don't ever wanna come down 
 I wanna see what's up there, actin' like I got it all figured out 
 I wanna go up there and I don't ever wanna come down 
 I wanna see what's up there, must be better than the hell on the ground 
 I wanna go up there and I don't ever wanna come down 
 I wanna see what's up there, actin' like I got it all figured out 
 I wanna go up there and I don't ever wanna come down 
 I wanna see what's up there, must be better than the hell on the ground
