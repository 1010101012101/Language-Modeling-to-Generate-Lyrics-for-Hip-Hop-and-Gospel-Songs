I just came down from the high of my life 
 I just, I just came down from the high of my life 
 See us popping champagne, we could do it all night 
 And if everything gone bad we gon' make it alright 
 How you expecting awards when you ain't put in work 
 And I just got off the phone, yeah with my realtor 
 And I've been eating so good that bitch my belly broke 
 And I might cop that Mustang cause bitch that Bentley talk 
 Put that sauce on that bitch real quick 
 Put that ice on that wrist real slick 
 Girl I know you know my wallet's real thick 
 And I'm wondering what your drinking 
 I just came down from the high of my life 
 I just, I just came down from the high of my life 
 See us popping champagne, we could do it all night 
 And if everything gone bad we gon' make it alright 
 We gon' fucking fuck with y'all, do it 
 We don't gotta stunt on y'all, do we? 
 Bring that money back to yours truly 
 When I'm rocking all my God and jewelry 
 Yeah, hey 
 I just hopped out the foreign 
 Looking so pretty, yeah 
 And yeah, that watch on my arm look like a trillion 
 You know that White Iverson, no keep that [?] 
 And I just bought out my brain, I feel like Bubble [?] 
 Girl I'm zoned out, I feel my zans 
 Ain't nobody understand 
 It's you and I, go and call your friends 
 Let's get a lot of kerosine 
 You gon' ride that bumpy grind 
 Yeah, let me see that double time 
 You ain't gotta tell them hoes, because they know 
 Yeah 
 I just came down from the high of my life 
 I just, I just came down from the high of my life 
 See us popping champagne, we could do it all night 
 And if everything gone bad we gon' make it alright 
 We gon' fucking fuck with y'all, do it 
 We don't gotta stunt on y'all, do we? 
 Bring that money back to yours truly 
 When I'm rocking all my God and jewelry 
 Tell me, who do you call? 
 When the night gets rough 
 And you're sitting by the phone 
 Cause all those drugs worn off 
 I just came down from the high of my life 
 I just, I just came down from the high of my life 
 See us popping champagne, we could do it all night 
 And if everything gone bad we gon' make it alright
