 But I'm still droppin' jaws 
 Got 'em lookin' like James Harden at the awards

 They be mad when I tend to ya

 These bitches, I son 'em like it's daylight 
 These niggas wanna know what it tastes like 
 What it tastes like, yo, what it tastes like, yo' 
 They wanna know what it tastes like, yo' 
 All this ice, it should taste like snow 
 Get kimonos and let's fly to Tokyo 
 Pretty, pretty please baby, won't you cop this for me? Uh
