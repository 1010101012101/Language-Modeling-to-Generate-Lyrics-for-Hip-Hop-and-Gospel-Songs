I'm a little good girl 
 I'm a little good girl 
 He makes me cry 
 He doesn't know why 
 He tries to change me 
 And says he loves me 
 Walk on by 
 Todokanai koe ima ai, ni aitai 
 I'm a little good girl 
 I'm a little good girl 
 What makes you happy? 
 I gave you everything 
 Oh please forgive me 
 For being me 
 Walk on by 
 Chikaku ni ite mo kanjiaenai 
 Jibun wo aishi hito wo aiseru 
 Walk on by
