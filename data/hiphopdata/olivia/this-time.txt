I no it can't be real 
 This must be a dream 
 I open up my eye to found 
 That your not here with me 
 So I tell myself that it's not the 
 End I just can't take the thought 
 I'm never holding you again 
 Remember all those times 
 I held you when you cried (cried) 
 Somehow we turned them tears to laughter 
 I have to wonder why you never said goodbye 
 So many questions still unanswered (whoa) 
 I'm broken it's my turn to cry, but I'm wondering 
 Who will bring me flowers this time (ooh whoa) 
 It my turn to cry, but I'm wondering 
 Who will bring me flowers this time (this time yeahha) 
 Took ya photographs put them all away 
 Cause it hurt so bad every time I see ya face 
 But in the middle of the night 
 I sit up in my bed 
 I just can't erase the picture of you in my head 
 No matter how I try to put the past behind (ooh yeah yeah 
 There's no happy ending after) 
 I have to wonder why you never (no no no) 
 Said goodbye 
 So many questions still unanswered (ooh) 
 I'm broken it's my turn to cry, but I'm wondering 
 Who will bring me flowers this time (ooh whoa) 
 It my turn to cry, but I'm wondering (wondering) 
 Who will bring me flowers this time (who bring me flowers this time yeah yeah) 
 I can't sleep, feel weak in feel with me why you have to 
 Go away lonely I miss you 
 I'm broken it's my turn to cry, but I'm wondering (whoa) 
 Who will bring me flowers this time (flowers no whoa) 
 It my turn to cry, but I'm wondering (wondering) 
 I'm broken it's my turn to cry, but I'm wondering (oh yeah) (wondering) 
 Who will bring me flowers this time (who bring me flowers) 
 It my turn to cry, but I'm wondering (now it's my turn cyr my turn to cry)
