You let go of my hand 
 You say you have important things to do 
 In search of something 
 Knocking in a faint sound 
 Oh... The pain is burning your senses 
 Oh... You're getting colder 
 Oh believe in me Oh believe in me 
 The magic you can create 
 If you only knew 
 You're forgetting me 
 Forgetting how to dream 
 Remember back then 
 When we played one the dandelion hill 
 Till the sunset 
 We didn't need anything else 
 Oh... You're always protecting yourself 
 Oh... Come here with me 
 Oh believe in me Oh believe in me 
 Do you ever feel this quietness inside? 
 That is where you'll find me 
 Nothing can erase me
