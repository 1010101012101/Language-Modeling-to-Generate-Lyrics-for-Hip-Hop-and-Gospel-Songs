Once upon a time, there was a mermaid 
 Who felt like something was missing in her life 
 But she didn't know what it was, one starlight night, 
 She swam up to the surface and met a pegasus soaring above her, 
 He told her about his world of wings and it resonated like a dream... 
 Tobi or not to be 
 A dream is never just a dream 
 I dream of light 
 It's so dark down here 
 Chotto kowai nani ka tarinai 
 The water used to be clear 
 Little mermaid yoru naiteru no kikoeru yo 
 Namida ga hikari no ame de sora wo kagayaku ssh 
 Kaze ga shinjitsu wo sasayaku raise the tides 
 Shio to michiru feel the depth of liquid skies 
 Ekitai no sora no fukasa shiritai 
 I can't go, I can't go, I'm too scared to let go 
 Taiyou tachi furu iro 
 Gathering wishes from the stars 
 Hide and seek with venus and mars 
 Mizu de saku lotus 
 Mou sagasu hitsuyou nai pinto focus and fly 
 Dreams come true 
 Druth comes from dreams 
 Remember how to fly 
 Tobi agaru 
 Remember 
 Yume ga kanau yume ga shinjitsu wo narau nami okosu nayami wo nokosu 
 Mukashi hitode ga hoshi 
 Tobu ryuu kodomo mizu ni otoshi 
 Seahorses are flying dragons that dive into the sea 
 Ryuu no otoshi ko mo tsubasa ari 
 Swim in saturns rings 
 See a rainbow when you're happy 
 Cause even starfish have wings 
 Hi no iri ni maiorita Pegasus 
 Sora wa tookute 
 Kaerarenai unmei 
 Soredemo kodou wa takamaru 
 Spread your wings 
 One with all living things 
 A pegasus sings 
 It's easy you can fly 
 Unkai de oyogitai 
 Take me with you 
 Demo tobu no wa jibun no tsubasa 
 Dare ni mo madowasarenai de 
 Shinjiru no wa jibun no tsubasa 
 Into your sekai I will fly 
 Believe 
 Mousugu soko ni tsuku 
 Matte ima kara iku 
 Dreams come true 
 Truth comes from dreams 
 I can fly 
 We all can fly 
 To be or not to be 
 To be 
 I can fly 
 I'm flying 
 So high 
 Fly
