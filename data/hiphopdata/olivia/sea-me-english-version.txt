I do not mean to 
 Make you unhappy 
 Listen closely to 
 The hesitant waves rolling in 
 Kiss me forever 
 Raindrops get blown by the wind 
 Into the rushing river it flows 
 It flows into the sea 
 Kiss me forever 
 Lemon drops melt into my mouth 
 And creeps out of my pores 
 It flows, it flows into the sea 
 I come from Venus 
 And you come from Venice 
 You melt my heart with your 
 Little rebel smile 
 Kiss me forever 
 Teardrops fall down my face 
 Seep down into the ground it flows 
 It flows into the sea 
 Kiss me forever 
 Moon drops rain down from the clouds 
 They glow as they spin and fall 
 And it lights up the sea 
 Kiss me forever 
 Raindrops get blown by the wind 
 Into the rushing river it flows 
 It flows into the sea 
 Kiss me forever 
 Teardrops fall down my face 
 Seep down into the ground it flows 
 It flows into the sea 
 Kiss me forever 
 Moon drops rain down from the clouds 
 They glow as they spin and fall 
 And it lights up the sea
