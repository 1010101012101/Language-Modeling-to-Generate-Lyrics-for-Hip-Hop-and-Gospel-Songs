Oh lovely change 
 A breeze of grapefruits and 
 Jasmine seas 
 Sexy burgundy skies 
 Sweet peppermint candies 
 Will the breeze become my air 
 Or should I have to hold my breath 
 For I don't want to be your China ware 
 Nor game of solitaire 
 Soyokaze yo mai orite tsutsumikonde 
 Watashi no moto e
