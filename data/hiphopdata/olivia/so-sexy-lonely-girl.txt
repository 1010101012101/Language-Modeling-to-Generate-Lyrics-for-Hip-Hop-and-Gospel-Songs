Summertime 
 Outside 
 Makin' love while the rain is fallin' 
 Touch me, gently 
 You know me, don't care who's watchin' 
 All day, all night, close your eyes & find my body 
 Whisper to me that you want it 
 Baby, baby 
 Heart be pounding when you near me 
 Feel so weak I need you wit' me 
 When I think of sexy, I think of you 
 Wanna know can you keep it up 
 Cause tonight I'm fellin oh so sexy 
 In the mood for makin' love 
 Wide open, look at how you got me 
 Can't wait 'til I get ya home 
 Need to feel your body wrapped around me 
 Gotta know can you keep it up 
 Cause tonight I'm feelin' oh so sexy 
 Let go, let love, you want it so don't try to fight it 
 It's just you, it's just us, that's the way I know you like it 
 Slowly, so deep, boy look what you up & started 
 Don't you even think of stoppin' 
 Just as soon as we hit the door 
 Our close are off & on the floor 
 I can't help feelin' the way I do, about you 
 My neck, my back, I'm sick & red 
 Don't think we'll make it to the bed 
 Can't help it, I get off on you
