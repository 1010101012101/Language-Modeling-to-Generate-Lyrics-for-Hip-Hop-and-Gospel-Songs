 Make it bounce to the high 
 Work my body ady 
 All over the damn track 
 Work that

 Throw it like a quarterback 
 Don't have a heartattack 
 Baby can you handle that 
 Tonight tonight 
 Can you feel me movin freely 
 Watch my body whine whine 
 Watch the motion cause commotion 
 Do ya like tha way I'm stacked in my jeans 
 Chorus~Spin it like a bottle top 
 Watch my booty drop 
 Watch my waistline whine whine 
 Twirl it like a lollipop 
 Give it all I got

 Throw it like a quarterback 
 Don't have a heartattack 
 Baby can you handle that 
 Tonight tonight 
 Can you feel me movin freely 
 Watch my body whine whine
