Keep me happy, out of line 
 Keep me sweet and satisfied 
 Come with me darling 
 Don't say no 
 How bout we just take it slow 
 Sexy baby you sure know 
 How to make my eyes glow 
 Come with me sugar 
 Do not fret 
 I have to tell you a secret 
 Staring into the sky 
 The nature hums music of you 
 Tell me, what do you feel? 
 'Cause I know I'm feeling something 
 Emerging magical sores in me 
 Tell me, what do you feel? 
 Maybe this is just a moment 
 But we're penetrating time 
 Yeah 
 Your waves are crashing into me 
 Exciting me and hurting me 
 I'm feeling sick 
 Oh what am I to do? 
 I think your sweet kiss will do 
 Take me over completely 
 I'll give you whatever you need 
 Tell me, what do you feel? 
 'Cause I know I'm feeling something 
 My senses are super sensitive 
 Tell me, what do you feel? 
 What I would do to be your girl 
 I'm aching without you 
 What do you feel? 
 What do you feel? 
 Tell me, What do you feel? 
 What do you feel?
