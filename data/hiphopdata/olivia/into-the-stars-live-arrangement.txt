I just wanna love 
 Where I shed this body right off me 
 I just wanna love 
 Where the past can't shape who I am 
 I can't escape these thoughts 
 Or these dreams of you leaving me 
 How stupid of me to give these 
 Lovely dreams to frightened nightmares 
 You take my heart to a place I want forever 
 This love is pulling me apart 
 Because I don't know who I am 
 You are all that I've dreamed of 
 You're showing me a way to heaven 
 I'm trying to fix it 
 Please wait for me 
 It'll be better soon 
 I just wanna love 
 Evil's got a grip on my body 
 I just wanna love 
 What's taking me so long? 
 I can't escape these thoughts 
 Or these dreams of you leaving me 
 How stupid of me to give these 
 Lovely dreams to frightened nightmares 
 You take my heart to a place I want forever 
 This love is pulling me apart 
 Because I don't know who I am 
 You are all that I've dreamed of 
 You're showing me a way to heaven 
 Day comes, night goes 
 You're standing still 
 I run off with the stars again 
 This love is pulling me apart 
 Because I don't know who I am 
 You are all that I've dreamed of 
 You're showing me a way to heaven 
 I'm trying to fix it 
 Please wait for me 
 It'll be better soon
