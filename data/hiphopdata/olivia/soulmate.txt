When I see your eyes suikomareru 
 Nandemo ieru say everything 
 Anata ni kansya living in castles as kings 
 Suika no tsubasa growing nectarine wings 
 Hikari no hayasa de skipping rope like kids 
 Rolling in the grass aka wain & jazz 
 Mugen no kouen futari mattari 
 Just chillin' like Native Americans 
 Ano toki no sora no aura 
 I know what you're thinking 
 Once you were my Inca prince 
 Omoidashita ano toki no kiss 
 Once you were my Egyptian queen 
 Omoidashita ano toki no dream 
 Anata ga mayou watashi mitsukeru 
 Anata to iru to jibun aiseru 
 When you've lost your way 
 I'll find you 
 When i'm with you always 
 I love myself 
 Once you were my son 
 Omoidashita himawari in the sun 
 You are the moon 
 Omoidashita ano issyun 
 Once you passed me by 
 Je me souviens de 
 Tu as sauv? moi 
 L'intention de mon? me 
 Cette une synchronicit? 
 Anata ga mayou watashi mitsukeru 
 Anata ga iru to jibun aiseru 
 When you've lost your way 
 I'll find you 
 When I'm with you always 
 I love myself 
 I'll find you 
 Find me too
