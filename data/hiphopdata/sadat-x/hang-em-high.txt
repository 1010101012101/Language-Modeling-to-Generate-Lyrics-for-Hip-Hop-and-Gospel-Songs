Wild Cowboys 
 And you know this 
 Lookin' at a Cowboy 
 And you know they're dead 
 A lot of niggaz stepped up to the bad man 
 Chest bucked out with your head wide open 
 Hopin, to spot, a chip in this frame 
 I lived and died by the burnin flame 
 Of the OK Corral, Cowboy style 
 From the Quarters on down to Colorado's 
 Big niggaz from uptown, ridin' into Tahoe's 
 Saloon settin, kids is walkin' round 
 Drinkin' whiskey and scotch, strictly out of shotglasses 
 Lookin' screwfaced at the next nigga who passes 
 There's women in garter belts and ciggarettes 
 And on the side there's the price game 
 Niggaz is playin' the price game 
 Indian Red, was bangin' niggaz in the head 
 With his man Apache Joe, they take your money off the floor 
 They side-bettin for a better, they makin' cheddar 
 That tribal shit is work ya sound the wompom drums 
 Cause my Indian man'sll break your great dick, UHH 
 Walk in the New York terrority 
 On the back of a tree, there's a picture of me 
 It says I'm lawless, flawless, a hustler plus gun rustler 
 Wanted in Carolina, for sellin some of New York's finer 
 Marshal Cooper say he want me, Marshal Cooper gotta get me 
 Marshal Cooper say beat me, Marshal Cooper better wet me 
 I gather alla y'all, all of my trusted men 
 All of my baddest niggaz, niggaz that's quickest with the triggers 
 There's distrubin news on the wire 
 That my dome piece is done sent to piece out for hire 
 I ain't goin' down over no money exchange 
 You late for say I, who reigns as King of the Range? 
 In this land of wildness 
 Yo you better pack your vest 
 In the streets there's nothin' but crime 
 So you best to watch your behind... 
 Meanwhile saloon settin is back to full swing 
 Bar's gettin' money people doin' they thing 
 There's strictly Boss Players with this kid named Minnesota 
 As women start to fill up, turn the notch on the grill up 
 And add mo' stakes to the house banks for gamblers 
 Half-pipes to scramblers, and free for Wild Cowboys 
 You never bring decoys if you wanna make real nouse 
 The bigger the stick, the bigger the fire 
 I never hit a man in the back, a coward acts like that 
 Lay out my black hat 'cause I feel like the bad man 
 Who on the rise, the D's to Manhattan 
 Let's walk the thirty paces on the Now Rule races 
 Oh it's the Marshal Cooper, and I love how he doin' this 
 Women sayin' don't get hurt, and I ain't plannin on it 
 Ten steps taken as I hit the blam factor 
 His dick to act up, was death the benefactor 
 Leave him twitchin in the dirt like Cousin Harold from the Menace 
 I'm in this to win this on the great wide trail 
 I'm ten times as bad as John Wayne, could ever be 
 Plus I'm down with the Indian, and need high to get the shit again 
 I'm responsible for that body in the alley 
 I'll Louisiana Purchase that ass with with Remi's spurs 
 And hard shots of Tequila, where the dancin girls 
 Let's get right as the story unfurls 
 Piano man keep playin', keep them keys bangin' 
 Single man get three graves there's gonna be a hangin' 
 Now this right here ain't for the youth to see 
 A grown man assed out swingin' from a tree 
 In this land of wildness 
 Yo you better pack your vest 
 In the streets there's nothin' but crime 
 So you best to watch your behind 
 Joe Tex was the biggest hombre from the projects 
 Had all the work locked down, so he thought 
 But he drank and got loose lipped, let a lot of news slip 
 Stripped of his game and got his self murdered 
 Thoughts of him are passin like the buffalo 
 Got his self rocked in the ninety-six brand new Acura 
 Niggaz said it was lightning BLAOW blew out the back mirror 
 Hah, youknowhatI'msayin? Dig, check it out 
 They say that Cowboys never die they just ride off into the sun 
 A little tale from Sadat X of how the WORLD was won 
 Check it out, remember this 
 Gun-slingers, dead-ringers with presidents 
 Is found tied with no explanation of how they died 
 Yo the great Sadat X, the High Plains Drifter 
 No question 
 In this land of wildness 
 Yo you better pack a vest 
 In the streets there's nothin' but crime 
 So you best to watch your behind
