(Feat. Brand Nubian) 
 Yeah, where the ladies at, where the ladies at? 
 Check it out, this is for all the ladies out there 
 With the Lump Lump, holding it down 
 Running scams, turning tricks, playing players 
 I'm telling you, you need to snap out of it, know what I'm saying? 
 (Grand Puba) 
 What the deal big mama, body like drama 
 Other than her mind her penny's short of a dime 
 Sherita doing Rita, slick moving senorita 
 Give her two margaritas, she's the big willie beater 
 Head to two fashion, love gear with a passion 
 Never going out looking slum, I say word she is, son 
 Nice lump lump, big chest caught me staring 
 Stretch the D and the Y of a shirt of Donna Karen 
 She's a schemer, cherry red 502a Beemer 
 Been out bar hopping an it ain't no stopping 
 I'm checking out the way that this chicken motivates 
 Spread legs, waist, and eggs up and down the tri-state 
 *Whoa here she comes*, dig get done 
 I'm a hit her with a clue and tell her see Frank Perdue 
 'Cause I keep my erection out the ??? section 
 Cause the wrong interjection might lead to infection 
 It be trees and cheese then bend the knees 
 Long a nigga keep paper then it's yours with ease 
 I know the whole of the half 'cause I deal with math 
 Quick to run that ass just to ride us class 
 "I've been doing my own thing" 
 "I've been doing my own thing" 
 (Lord Jamar) 
 Yeah I've seen you at the African street fest 
 Dressed in three fourth to your ankles 
 Tight wrapped skirt, what can that hurt? 
 You was buying books giving flirtatious looks 
 At the brothers that was eyeing your equipment 
 Light skinned pigment, pierced the belly button 
 And you couldn't tell her nothing 
 Said she loved a man with dreads 
 And wasn't impressed with the name brand threads 
 Are you seeing through our gameplan? 
 Sex every night, but never with the same man 
 A freak for the knowledge, your first week in college 
 You was sneaking brothers in the dorm 
 And lost your mind when you got your pad off campus 
 All the time keeping up the facade, you like to fuck with the gods 
 Now you stuck between a rock and a hard place 
 Faced with the facts that your acts are a detriment, to what you represent 
 Can't be a chicken and act like the science you kicking 
 Mad niggas be sticking, licking fingers after ever meal 
 Now she want singers with a deal 
 I'm only bringing you the real, no matter what I say 
 You gonna do what you feel 
 "I've been doing my own thing" 
 "I've been doing my own thing" 
 (Sadat X) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I had seen this chick at the bar, ??? he was thirst 
 The physical was there but mentally she was the worst 
 Walked around with her ass out and her glass out 
 Of her hand, she sees nothing, my man 
 Ask her world topics, has she been to the tropics 
 With this cat she hardly know, Scott LaRock "Super Hoe" 
 Most likely to have a baby from a cat alone lover 
 Is that your wifey man? No that's my baby mother 
 You arrive at the pop of a cork, like a hawk 
 Stay around, chitter chatter, and make small talk 
 Get figety and then you walk 
 And you wonder why I drag your name through New York 
 With the velcro cup that's stuck to your fingers 
 Searching out the drug dealers and the fly looking singers 
 Getting passed like a blunt, but in the club you front 
 You insist that you ain't been twist by ?hevenies? 
 Niggas are you crazy, I got the figures and the numbers 
 Don't lie, save your bullshit, don't try to be fly 
 Live as you live and have a good life 
 But a chick like that can't make a good wife 
 These words I say might cut like a knife 
 But I'm only trying to save you stress and strife 
 "I've been doing my own thing" 
 "I've been doing my own thing" 
 "I've been doing my own thing" 
 "I've been doing my own thing"
