I'm in the place, y'all, trippin' on things 
 I just walked in, spillin' my drink 
 Played ball but I never scored a basket 
 You already know, you ain't gotta ask it (Swagless) 
 You know I'm (Swagless) 
 Ugly, clumsy, trust me 
 Sandusky wouldn't fuck me 
 You know who's swagless 
 To get my shit together, I would have to eat magnets (Swagless) 
 So if you're looking, call it off 
 I'm right here homie, swag holocaust 
 Eh, I'm fever than Justin Bieber 
 I tried to do the dougie, it was looking like a seizure 
 I'm accidentally celibate 
 I could sign and drive a boxy Honda SUV and not be in my element 
 I been irrelevant, I'm still delicate 
 But this year, I can bench 85 like Bill Belichick 
 Check it out 
 Drooling out my mouth, falling on a couch 
 I just dropped a coffee, sloppy, and I'm retarded 
 And I only wrote fourteen bars 
 I'm in the place, y'all, trippin' on things 
 I just walked in, spillin' my drink 
 Played ball but I never scored a basket 
 You already know, you ain't gotta ask it (Swagless) 
 You know I'm (Swagless) 
 I met this girl named Betty, she was all about it 
 We started dancing, shook her booty all around it 
 I felt so guilty, had to call my man and tell him 
 I hung up and lit a candle, put on Lady Antebellum 
 I walk up to the bar and order cran and Peach Street 
 Peach Street, burn, cruising, sleeping in the backseat 
 I'm so real that I freak if I see a spider 
 I won't walk into a dark room without a lighter 
 Give me the mic and I made it my two-thug shit I chipped it 
 I'ma be out at a restaurant counting the bill but you know I won't pitch in 
 Glitchin', nonfiction books, my one addiction 
 Picturin' my nana on the couch knittin' me mittens 
 Broke and lazy, making babies 
 Collecting food stamps to save for a Mercedes 
 Man I'm swagless, but I smell good 
 Spray painting Hanukkah stars all over the neighborhood 
 I'm in the place, y'all, trippin' on things 
 I just walked in, spillin' my drink 
 Played ball but I never scored a basket 
 You already know, you ain't gotta ask it (Swagless) 
 You know I'm (Swagless)
