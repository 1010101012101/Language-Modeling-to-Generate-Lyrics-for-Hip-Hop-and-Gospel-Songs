What's up? 
 I'm sorry to interrupt your evening at the eatery 
 But I'm about to freak what you believe unbelievably 
 You will see, every time Sparker-comma-Peter speaks 
 It's bacon for the Jews and gay marriage for the Jesus freaks 
 VHS Tapes flying out the Redbox 
 All the Yankees fans cheering for the Red Sox 
 And the Neo-Nazis all growing dreadlocks 
 Listening to Erykah Badu until their head nods 
 I got Facebook accounts for the Amish 
 Throw a little steak in while I'm making vegans omelettes 
 Democrats out hunting in the forestry 
 Republicans giving tax cuts to minorities 
 All the beer snobs chilling sipping Natty Ice 
 While I take a bachelor and match him with a battered wife 
 Got the hipsters clothes-shopping at Walmart 
 Hanging with the B-team, acting like they're all-stars 
 Unplugging tanning booths in Little Italy 
 Hangin' with some country music fans bumpin' Lil' B 
 Making A&R spit bars in vans 
 While I'm reading poetry to some NASCAR fans 
 Look, it's Peter Sparker in this bitch -- I'm the people's douche 
 And I will never quit until the day I see the poor become the rich 
 And the rich become the poor 
 So they're holding open doors 
 For the single moms who buy their food up at the dollar store 
 I got some alpha males thinking they're lame 
 Donald Trump just asked me for spare change 
 The Westboro Baptist Church is having gay sex 
 While I got the sneakerheads shopping up at Payless 
 Then I got the teenagers all leaving social media 
 And reading what a library is on Wikipedia 
 I can make a morning person sleep until the evening 
 Shit, I got LeBron James moving back to Cleveland 
 I can get the housewives to all stop gossiping 
 And get the Taliban starting all-girls colleges (colleges) 
 Illiterate people they all wanna read about it 
 Let's do something sweet and not tweet about it 
 Deadbeat dads asking where the diapers are 
 Drag queens all dancing in the biker bar 
 Jocks giving geeks props as they pass in the hall 
 I got Kobe Bryant passing the ball 
 Come on 
 It's Peter Sparker in this bitch -- I'm The People's Douche 
 And I will never quit until the day I see the poor become the rich 
 And the rich become the poor 
 So they're holding open doors 
 For the single moms who buy their food up at the dollar store 
 Man, the day is gonna come when the bosses will be generous 
 And all the employees will get some benefits 
 For once -- and until the day it does 
 You know I'm your fucking bud 
 I'm The People's Douche 
 Now let me see those dirty hands up 
 Put your hands up 
 If you only got a dollar in your pocket and that shit ain't enough 
 Put your hands up 
 Put your hands up 
 If you're not here to put 'em up 'cause you had to work and couldn't come 
 It's Peter Sparker in this bitch -- I'm The People's Douche 
 And I will never quit until the day I see the poor become the rich 
 Or the rich become the poor 
 So they're holding open doors 
 For the single moms who buy their food up at the dollar store 
 Man, the day is gonna come when the bosses will be generous 
 And all the employees will get some benefits 
 For once -- and until the day it does 
 You know I'm your fucking bud 
 It's The People's Douche 
 Now let me see those dirty hands up
