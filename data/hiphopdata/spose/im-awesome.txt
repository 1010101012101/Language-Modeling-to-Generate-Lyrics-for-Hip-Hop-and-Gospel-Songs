Awesome, Awesome, Awesome, Awesome 
 I don't necessarily have to be here for this 
 I'm gonna keep the headphones though 
 Motherfucker, I'm awesome! No you're not dude, don't lie 
 I'm awesome! I'm driving round in my mom's ride 
 I'm awesome! A quarter of my life gone by 
 And I met all my friends online 
 Motherfucker, I'm awesome! I will run away from a brawl 
 I'm awesome! There's no voice mail, nobody called 
 I'm awesome! I can't afford to buy 8-balls 
 And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall 
 You know my pants sag low (low) even though (though) 
 that went out of style like ten years ago (go) 
 Spose... I got the swagger of a cripple 
 I got little biceps, getting fatter in the middle 
 And lyrically I'm not the best 
 Physically the opposite of Randy Moss and yet 
 so preposterous, feel the awesomeness 
 the most obnoxious guest up at the sausage fest 
 Oh yes, The girls are repulsed 
 so I hide in my hood like I'm joining a cult 
 Uh huh, I'm as nervous as my cattle dirty Curtis 
 All my writtens are bitten and all my verses are purchased 
 Me, I'll never date an actress, Got too many back zits 
 Plus my whole home aroma is cat piss 
 Every show I do is poorly promoted 
 and if you like this? It's cause my little sister wrote it 
 I'm awesome! No you're not dude, don't lie 
 I'm awesome! I'm driving round in my mom's ride 
 I'm awesome! A quarter of my life gone by 
 And I met all my friends online 
 Motherfucker, I'm awesome! I will run away from a brawl 
 I'm awesome! There's no voice mail nobody called 
 I'm awesome! I can't afford to buy 8-balls 
 And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall 
 I'm awesome! 
 *The swagger of a cripple* 
 Check it out 
 I'm from Maine and I don't hunt (nope!) and I can't ski 
 Smoke weed but I can't roll blunts, find me 
 whipped by my wifey, my neck not icy 
 Eatin' at Mcdonalds because Subway's pricey 
 Uh and my unibrow's plucked 
 Just asked my mom if I could borrow ten bucks 
 She's like "For what? Blunt wraps and some Heinekens? 
 You skinny prick, Go get a gym membership and vitamins" 
 I'm like, Mom, please; don't blame it on me 
 I got my bad habits from You, dad, and aunt Steve 
 My attitude's sour but my futon's sweet 
 And the hair on my ass, it is Jumanji 
 Suit's untailored, ringtone Taylor Swift 
 Can't tweet upon my Twitter 'cause I haven't done shit 
 Bank account red, Body ungroomed 
 The only thing good about me is I'm off stage soon 
 I'm awesome! No you're not dude, don't lie 
 I'm awesome! I'm driving round in my moms ride 
 I'm awesome! A quarter of my life gone by 
 And I met all my friends online 
 Motherfucker, I'm awesome! I will run away from a brawl 
 I'm awesome! There's no voice mail nobody called 
 I'm awesome! I can't afford to buy 8-balls 
 And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall 
 I'm awesome! 
 Furthermore 
 I'm cornier than ethanol, cheesier than provolone 
 I spent ages eight to ten living in a motor home 
 With a ego the size of Tim Duncan 
 Even though I got shit for brains like a blumpkin 
 I'm twenty-four serving lobster rolls 
 Because I spent a decade filling Optimos 
 and I'm not even the bomb In Maine 
 On my game, I'm only about as sexy as John McCain 
 Now put your hands up if you have nightmares 
 If you wouldn't man up if there was a fight here 
 If you got dandruff, If you drink light beer 
 I'm out of breath 
 ...But I'm awesome! No, you're not dude, don't lie 
 I'm awesome! I'm driving round in my moms ride 
 I'm awesome! A quarter of my life gone by 
 And I met all my friends online 
 Motherfucker, I'm awesome! I will run away from a brawl 
 I'm awesome! There's no voice mail nobody called 
 I'm awesome! I can't afford to buy 8-balls 
 And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall 
 I'm awesome
