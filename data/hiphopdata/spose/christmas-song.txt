Grab the weed, I got a story to tell 
 A couple years ago, it was Christmas night 
 Back in my hometown, Wells 
 The snow fall about an inch an hour 
 And on the road, just our pickup truck and snowplows 
 After familial obligations 
 Me and my man, Phil met up to start blazing 
 Around 8, sparked the backwoods on the back roads 
 The windshield blew the snow like sachmo 
 I asked, "How was your Christmas?", he said, "It sucked" 
 I asked, "Why", he said, "Man, my sister's fucked 
 And if that slut died tonight, it wouldn't be enough" 
 I asked for an explanation, he just took another puff 
 Handed it to me, I told him mine wasn't better 
 I just got a couple corny ass sweaters 
 And my family embarrassed me because apparently 
 Getting arrested twice in a month is worthy of a parody 
 Just then, turned on the bears dance, all whipped 
 With woman and a kid in it in a ditch 
 Volkswagen, the color of cocaine 
 With the front end buried inside of the snow bank 
 Temperature's near zero, man, it isn't May 
 No reception out here to call triple A 
 It's safe to say, if Phil and I hadn't drove by 
 This lady and her son coulda frozen and died 
 We put the woods in the ashtray 
 Stopped the truck, put the gloves on 
 Hopped out of the ship and walked that way 
 We asked if we could help 
 She asked, "Oh, thank God, yes", she looked glazed herself 
 Her son shivered in the passenger wearing his seat-belt 
 He looked to be about 12 
 We said, "No prob", the son said, "You're our guardian angels" 
 We laughed and moved the truck at an angle 
 We hooked the chains up and put her in drive 
 We had a mouth faster than a first pitch pop fly 
 It was all thank you's and huggin' 
 Could've sworn I smelled rum on the breath of the woman 
 Nonetheless, I gave her son a high-five, said, bye 
 Hopped up in the truck and drove into the night 
 Never told anybody about the good deed of the two dudes in hoodies 
 I wish the story ended there 
 I woke the next morning with the sun 
 Reflecting off the snow in the yard out front 
 I felt fine in my flannel sheets 
 The day after a snowstorm tends to bring clarity 
 And a shitload of shoveling 
 I was still living at the home that my mother's in 
 I pulled the covers off, I felt quite alive 
 As I reached for my phone that I had on silent 
 And this was years ago now but I recall 
 I saw 16 texts, 31 missed calls 
 I knew something wasn't right 
 I ran downstairs, mom tears in her eyes 
 And her mouth agape staring at the TV 
 I said, "What happened?", I knew something was creepy 
 She just pointed at the screen 
 I walked down next to her to see and I saw it 
 2 dead in a drunk driving crash in Wells 
 A woman, 22 and boy aged 12 
 One survivor was in critical condition 
 It was the mother of the boy, they think she had been drinking 
 The scene on the screen looked grimy 
 A white Jetta bisected by a pine tree 
 In the background, a green jeep flipped 
 I put my hand to my mouth and said, "Jesus" 
 As I recognized the sugar-loaf sticker 
 On the back of the jeep that belonged to Phil's sister 
 The whole scene flashed, blue and red lights 
 Illuminating Christmas night 
 My heart sunk like a plane with no wings 
 Because I understood the whole thing 
 My heart sunk like a plane with no wings 
 Broken 
 I mean, what if we had left them in that ditch? 
 What if we never burned cruise that we were great kids 
 What if Phil was a bad dude like everybody thought 
 Because he's so pot and we had never even stopped and helped them 
 What if I'd questioned that mom? 
 What if Phil's sister and that boy weren't gone? 
 What if that right that we did wasn't wrong? 
 What if and so on and on until the break of dawn? 
 Just another Christmas song 
 Just another Christmas song 
 Going on and on and on and on and on 
 It goes on and on and on and on and it goes on 
 Just another Christmas song 
 Going on and on and on and on and on 
 Life goes on and on and on and on 
 This is just another Christmas song
