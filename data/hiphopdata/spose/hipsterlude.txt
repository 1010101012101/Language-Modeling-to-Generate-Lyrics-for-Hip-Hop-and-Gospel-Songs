I wanna be a hipster 
 Get a couple pairs of pants from my sister 
 Get wax for my mustache whiskers 
 Keep it growing till I'm looking like a drifter, whoa 
 I guess I'll be a hipster 
 Let everybody know that I'm looking 
 For some cigarettes and some couch cushions 
 For the day that I'll move out to Brooklyn 
 And start a band 
 And the name of the band will be some symbols 
 And our music will never sound simple 
 And when people start to like us we'll break up 
 'Cause people liking us is lame and we're weird 
 Weird 
 Weirder than you 
 I'm sippin' IPA 
 I sip that double IPA 
 Vanilla stout 
 Brewed with nutmeg and barley from 
 Some country besides Bavaria 
 'Cause Bavaria is too trendy 
 And I don't like anything that's trendy 
 Even though I'm just a fucking poser 
 I'll be a hipster 
 Get a couple pairs of pants from my sister 
 Get wax for my mustache whiskers 
 Keep it growing till I'm looking like a drifter, whoa 
 I guess I'll be a hipster 
 Let all my friends out there know I'm looking 
 For some cigarettes and some couch cushions 
 For the day that I'll move out to Brooklyn 
 And start a band
