See me riding in the 
 03 Altima, feeling like a boss 
 'Cause I just got paid and I got the day off 
 Sixty hours last week, that's seven hundred bucks 
 Now I can pay my speeding ticket and buy bud 
 Man I been broke since last 
 Saturday I had to go to Coinstar with a jar just to get gas 
 To get to work where I'm flippin burgers till I get swamp-ass 
 My folks don't own no business 
 I just cut fish and did dishes 
 But when it's payday? I'm bimpin' 
 I got old dudes in my pants (pause) 
 Ulysses S. Grant, dawg 
 Had a lot of long days, now I'm whippin' bimpin' 
 Bumpin' Andre and Antwan 
 That's Outkast, I'm a misfit 
 I got no whips for Christmas 
 My broke folks, if you listenin' 
 Sing this shit: 
 You can fuck way more women 
 Spend way more cash 
 You can rock two chains 
 You can kick my ass 
 You can drink more liquor 
 You can smoke more weed 
 But you'll never feel as good as me 
 When I'm riding in the 
 03 Altima, feeling like a boss

 Sixty hours last week, that's seven hundred bucks

 Lemme see your hands high if you're cash-low 
 If your manager is an asshole 
 If your favorite band broke up but 
 You couldn't get the shift off for their last show 
 You're working nine days a week 
 Now you and your girl don't speak 
 But when you get your paycheck you can buy the liquor that'll 
 Make her wanna freak 
 Do that shit that makes you feel personally 
 Like Spose does when he puts a verse to beat 
 When you get to upgrade from commercial weed 
 And you stop by your work, but just to beep 
 'Cause you're a have-not, got a padlock 
 On the bulkhead of your Dad's spot 
 Then yell this shit like Ad Rock 
 When it MMM--DROPS??? 
 You can fuck way more women 
 Spend way more cash 
 You can rock two chains 
 You can kick my ass 
 You can drink more liquor 
 You can smoke more weed 
 But you'll never feel as good as me

 I just got an order in right after I cleaned the grill (cleaned the grill) 
 I been workin' overtime but it still doesn't cover the bills (it don't cover the bills) 
 My landlord raised the rent again and my boss cut my hours back (cut my hours back) 
 So how will I get ahead unless they cut me some slack? (cut me some slack) 
 Man my credit isn't rated A 
 So you know where I'll B -- working 
 Burning pirated CDs 
 Whippin' with my gas tank on E 
 Dressed like I don't give a F 
 Bank account, negative one G 
 Can't afford to say H-I to a J 
 But, if you hit me on payday? 
 I'll front the loot, I'll buy the bag 
 I'll comp the beer, I'll pay the tab 
 I'll drive the whip, I'll buy the gas 
 I got this shit, don't gotta pay me back 
 I'm feeling like I'm Shawn 
 Carter, Daly, Puffy Combs 
 And when it's all gone? 
 Fuck it -- I'm still riding in the 
 03 Altima, feeling like a boss 
 'Cause I just got paid and I got the day off 
 Sixty hours last week, that's seven hundred bucks 
 Now I can pay my speeding ticket and buy bud
