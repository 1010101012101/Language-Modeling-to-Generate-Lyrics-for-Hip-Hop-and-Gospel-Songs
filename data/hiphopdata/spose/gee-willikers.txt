Welcome back to sunny Wells, Maine! 
 Guess who's back off the couch, got the panties in a drought 
 Duct-taping Casey Anthony's mouth 
 It's Mister "No you're not, Dude", back with some hot new 
 Raps for these kindergarteners to smoke pot to 
 'Cause shit's changed since I came in to the cipher 
 Because everyone was aggro, now they're all nicer 
 Pants used to sag low, now they're all tighter 
 And the black dudes who rhyme are named Wayne and Tyler 
 Huh, we musta smoked something funky 
 Somewhere back there and we all got the munchies 
 Ate Hershey's Cookies 'n' Cream and got clumsy 
 'Cause there's white rappers everywhere and nobody's hungry 
 Used to have to pay dues, they paid dudes 
 To get YouTube views while they play Beirut 
 Enabling fake crews to take spots 
 I heard Sam Adams and it made me miss Aesop Rock 
 Yeah, The One-Hit Wonder Guy Who Raps is back 
 To make your thunder thighs jiggle if your ass is fat 
 With some fact-packed Anglo-Saxon backpack tracks 
 My dishwasher got racks on racks 
 I got 'em like: 
 Gee Willikers! Fuck that shit 
 I bet he doesn't know any black kids 
 I got 'em like: 
 Gee Golly! Man, what a shit show 
 I knew I hated Spose from the get-go 
 Gee Willikers! I know I can't lose 
 Making rap songs that these strippers can't dance to 
 Gee Golly, I'm the same old cat 
 I, I, I, I keep it bimpin' 
 What's up? I'm Spose, if you didn't know 
 The representative of people who got little dough 
 And I never spit a rhyme trying to get a ho 
 I'm not trying to put the big L in Deuce Bigelow 
 Nor am I trying to be the hardest dude 
 Or act like it's all good bro, no barbecues 
 A grimy major label signed me 
 To a situation hairy as vaginas in the 90s 
 Find me back in Maine cacklin' 
 Still got weed as "we would" as a contraction 
 I still sip Shipyards, pigs lingering 
 Spit bars, backwoods in my fingerprints 
 Some couplets I come up with seem funny 
 Other pairs are hair-raising like I breed bunnies 
 I'm still ungroomed, I'm back in the flesh 
 I spit it raw unbridled like The Bachelorette 
 Check it 
 I know that the folks don't listen dissin' 
 Though other bros don't spit efficient 
 Broke, out of soap did dish in kitchens 
 Hooked on a lure like this is fishing 
 I been mistakenly taken for humorously but assuming I'm making a joke like 
 Gee Willikers! Fuck that shit 
 I bet he doesn't know any black kids 
 I got 'em like: 
 Gee Golly! Man, what a shit show 
 I knew I hated Spose from the get-go 
 Gee Willikers! I know I can't lose 
 Making rap songs that these strippers can't dance to 
 Gee Golly, I'm the same old cat 
 I, I, I, I keep it bimpin' 
 (Chord change!) 
 You're now rockin' with the townfolk spokesman 
 Who girls think is too short, but I'm not from Oakland 
 And it's been years since I deposited tokens 
 But I been in the game making bread, you're just loafin' 
 This is the voice of the villagers 
 Not sitting back, scared to act, whispering "Gee Willikers!" 
 Naw, this is a uprising, dudes are just rhyming 
 I fantasised 'bout this when I was just Ryan 
 Come kick it with the aged liquor sipper 
 Slipper rocker, pick a pocket of a major label knickerbocker 
 Saggin', keep my circle tighter than some leather pants 
 Whole state behind me like a weatherman, damn 
 Gee Willikers! Fuck that shit 
 I bet he doesn't know any black kids 
 I got 'em like: 
 Gee Golly! This kid's a shit show 
 I knew I hated Spose from the get-go 
 Gee Willikers! I know I can't lose 
 Making rap songs that these strippers can't dance to 
 Gee Golly, I'm the same old cat 
 I, I, I, I got 'em like: 
 Gee Willikers! I know I can't lose 
 Making rap songs that these strippers can't dance to 
 Gee Golly, I'm the same old cat 
 I, I, I, I got 'em like:
