(Always Smokin' it up) 
 Yeah 
 (I love Wells) 
 Wells, Maine 
 I used to bust tables 
 I'm able with wetted rags 
 I used to boil lobster and toss them in netted rags 
 Shit, I used to get chicks quivering quick when they would smell me up in Wells after delivering fish 
 Every day, same jam, Kyle, Jim and Dan 
 Years till we're finished 
 Fixated on that minute hand 
 Never been canned 
 Or even bagged like the grocers 
 But I never been promoted except upon posters 
 Rarely ever working on a sober mind 
 I'm hoping for a moment that I'm not in need of overtime 
 Jolly John advertised a Sign-and-Drive 
 No, still too broke 
 Me, I fear its 9 to 5 for my entire time alive 
 I strive to stay occupied 
 Methods I got various 
 I'm revitalised when I'm back into the chariot 
 And then I'm whipping home 
 Alone with my sickened dome 
 IPhone clicking lit 
 See my bit flicker on 
 Tires by Michelin, Route 1 North 
 If you relate to what I say, dude, come forth 
 You rolled in late, You're hearing it 
 Your boss he's on his period 
 What a joker, Why so serious? 
 I put on my hat (hat) 
 I put on my shoes (shoes) 
 Another day, same shit, nothing new 
 You fear its work till you drop 
 But if you hate your job say (yeah yeah yeah yeah) 
 I put on my hat (hat) 
 I put on my shoes (shoes) 
 Another day, same shit, nothing new

 But if you hate your job say (yeah yeah yeah yeah) 
 6 in the morning, roll out of the old sack 
 It's a brand new day of the same old crap 
 I stumble around looking for clothes on the floor 
 Grab my old hat then I stroll out the door 
 On my way to work, driving reckless 
 Coffee and a Camel Light for breakfast, check this 
 A 9 to 5 for me would be heaven, 
 Yeah, got a 9 to 5, gotta be there at 7 
 Doesn't matter, got my ladder, climbing on a roof, 
 But I'd rather be just babbling and rhyming in a booth 
 I am more than the truth, This is living proof 
 You can tell by the mud on the bottom of my boots 
 Do work - got it written on the daily planner 
 Whether it's a mic in my hand, paintbrush or a hammer 
 My timberlands are steel toe, my collar is blue 
 Do what you got to do to make a dollar or two 
 Yeah, I'm talking to you, 'cause life really ain't much 
 More than swinging a hammer or slinging a paint brush 
 Got the back wood rolled before I dash home 
 As I dip back to a 6-pack and bath robe 
 I put on my hat (hat) 
 I put on my shoes (shoes) 
 Another day, same shit, nothing new 
 I fear its work till you drop 
 But if you hate your job say (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
