I started out underground, 
 I was kinda like a seed 
 I had no manager, I book my shows, 
 Made the posters and afterwards I sold CD's 
 Then I made a song making fun of all the bragging, 
 And it brew up in like, not long 
 Then I got signed to a deal, threw me out to L.A., 
 Put me in the studio and told me... 
 We want you to write a Pop Song (2x) 
 And make it sound like this 
 Make it sound like this (7x) 
 And do it for the kids! 
 'Cause the kids want hits 
 They don't give a s*** about the rhymes you spit 
 They just want a nice beat that they 
 All could rhyme to, with a chorus catchier 
 Than swine flu times two! 
 I know you like free mode beats, 
 So you compose verses like they we're a 
 Key note speech but... 
 We just want you to be 3oh3!, 
 Mixed with Flo-Rida mixed with B.o.B. 
 Capiche? 
 So make another Airplanes 
 Or a song like Billionaire, 
 Either's fair game 
 Do it or go down in flames 
 Back to Maine you can beg mousse 
 For spare change 
 You can't sing with auto tune it 
 Make it sound like someone else's music 
 We brought writers who could make it sound tighter 
 We could pull it all night baby... 
 We want you to write a Pop Song (2x) 
 We want you to write a Pop So... ng (2x) 
 And make it sound like this 
 Make it sound like this (7x) 
 And do it for the kids! 
 No, I wanna do it for hip hop, 
 You know fresh to death like a bird 
 In a zip lock 
 You're like SPOSE, you're not f****** 
 Rick Ross 
 We want something more like Ke$ha, TiK Tok 
 I wrote a verse, and said listen to this s*** 
 They put their hands to their foreheads as I kicked it 
 They're like, look, I don't think that you get it 
 Nobody cares about your verses, 
 It's not 96 kid 
 I told them, look man, I'd rather had my wrist lit, 
 Than sound like every other f****** singer in the business 
 They're like, really SPOSE, would it be that cataclysmic 
 To make a couple songs for top 40 and rhythmic 
 With hooks big enough to catch Moby Dick with 
 With very few words and some melodies addictive 
 If you're not up to the task, grab your bags, 
 Call a cab 
 It's too bad because... 
 We want you to write a Pop Song (2x) 
 We want you to write a Pop So... ng (2x) 
 (And when you do) 
 And make it sound like this 
 Make it sound like this (15x) 
 (Ending) 
 We want you to write a Pop Song (2x) 
 We want you to write a Pop So... ng (2x) 
 And do it for the kids!
