Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic 
 Though I'm a proponent though, 
 Though I'm a proponent though, 
 Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic 
 Wells Maine Wells Maine, be-be-be smart don't be a retard 
 (First Verse) 
 Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic 
 I propose doing both with discretion I've learned lessons 
 Chilling watching Conan in the lone in the zone homie 
 Find me lit like a fluorescent no question and burn sessions 
 You want to converse yet my words nonsensical 
 Hit my vision blurred reputation reprehensible 
 Find me with some beasters at five eastern four central 
 If the end is near dutch beer in my tentacles 
 Let's say we skip wife swap girl find a bright spot 
 In this dark world drive around flip off the pike cops 
 When I'm dead I might stop or maybe when mice talk 
 Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic 
 Though I'm a proponent though, 
 Though I'm a proponent though, 
 Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic 
 Wells Maine Wells Maine, be-be-be smart don't be a retard 
 (Second Verse) 
 Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic 
 I propose doing both with discretion I've learned lessons 
 Homie I ain't thuggin' just plugin the microphone 
 And I'll show you how I've been fresh 
 With the pencils since adolescence 
 My punctuation period on point properly 
 Real name Cameron spelt with no apostrophes 
 On top of beats stopping me is obsolete 
 I'm either dropping free's or just jotting my philosophies 
 Hi my name is Cam Groves I've been on the mic since 
 Fifteen big dreams no drivers license 
 No matter what life gives whether it be wife kids 
 I'll be on the mic holding tight like some vice grips 
 Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic 
 Though I'm a proponent though, 
 Though I'm a proponent though, 
 Though I'm a proponent of boning and smoking chronic 
 Wells Maine Wells Maine, be-be-be smart don't be a retard
