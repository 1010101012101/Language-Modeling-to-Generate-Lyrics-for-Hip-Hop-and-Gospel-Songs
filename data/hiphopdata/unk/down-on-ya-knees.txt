Down on ya knees like a top notch hoe [x8] 
 (Ay gurl get down) 
 She say she neva dun it she say she neva tried 
 Smoke 2 blunts a purp an she a god damn lie 
 Got down on ha knees popped a pill an showed a rabbit 
 Den she, bent ha knees rocked ha hips an did da poole palce 
 Now can you do it wit no hands just ass an hips 
 I called my nigga maceo we made a quick flip 
 Get down on yo knees lik a top notch hoe 
 And make yo booty go faster den a lambo 
 I love dem pretty tities an yo ass kinda thick 
 She hit the stage 2 ways and did a side kick (damn) 
 We some hood niggaz throw it back and don't stop it 
 Mix a lil trina then add a lot a white chocolate 
 We keep then switchers roll grey goose il make ha twurk 
 A hundred pounds cush a fifty pack of purp 
 So if you hot an ready say it I ain't neva scared 
 An from the club to the block for a blockhead 
 Get down on yo knees pop dat pussy lik I'm pastor troy

 We gettin' money over here but I ain't jeezy mane 
 I jus wanna see you shake it like in tip drill 
 But jus move dem draws to the side show me you 4real 
 On the real show me that you can pop it hard enuff

 So get back gurl an dance how dem freaks do 
 Jus because you dance dat don't mean you won too

 Ima mac quick flippin hoes like contacts 
 So get down on ya knees like a top notch
