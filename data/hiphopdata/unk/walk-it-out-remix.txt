 (Andre 3000) 
 Walk it out like a usher 
 If you say real talk, I probably won't trust ya 
 If you want to go to war, the gun's my pleasure 
 Even Jesus had 12 disciples on the level, trigger, whatever 
 Peyimmmmp, you don't want nan day of three thou' 
 I'm like jury duty - you're new to this part of town 
 Your white tee, well to me, look like a nightgown 
 Make your momma proud, take that thing two sizes down 
 Then you'll, look like the man that you are, or what you could be 
 I can I give a damn 'bout your car, but then I would be 
 If it was considered a classic befo' the drastic change 
 In production when cars were metal instead of plastic 
 Value - is what I'm talkin' 'bout, take two of these and walk it out 
 You'll be the reason they chalk it out, you can't be the king in the parkin lot 
 Forever - not sayin' I'm the best but till they find somethin' better 
 I am here, no fear, write me a letter, till then 
 I walk it out, I walk it out, I walk it out, I walk it out 
 I walk it out, I walk it out, I walk it out 
 I Westside walk it ow-out, I Westside walk it ow-out 
 I Westside walk it ow-out, then Eastside walk it ow-out 
 (Unk) 
 I walked it out the bank, with a lot of zeros 
 That's what my teachers called me, predictions like they Cleo 
 So I do my dance for 'em, then make my forty thousand 
 I do that in a month, I'm on resorts and islands 
 I make them walk it out, yeah, it's me again 
 But I'm with Jones, Daddy Fatsacks and Benjamin 
 I roll with made men, that brake the stage in 
 And keep the girls happy, so y'all can get the nappy 
 Gangsters they do they dance, they do it to my song 
 See I was up in Cali, Crip-walkin' it all night long 
 Drop twenty on my neck, got ten on they wrist 
 A billion doller look, a million doller kiss 
 I'm nationwide homey, you still at home homey 
 With no promotions on me, man that's balogna homey 
 The album off in sto's, I'm "Beat'n Down Yo Block" 
 Now 'gwan and walk it out, they still on my jock 
 (Jim Jones - over Chorus)

 Now we don't walk it out, we drop-top Porsche it out 
 I hopped out floss it out, I bring my Air Forces out (clean) 
 I'm blowin' purple smoke, I cough it out, ball it up then ball it out 
 Tap the bottle, pour it out - BALLIN~! 
 Now do the fade-away, and throw some paper-way 
 And we can skate away, tell the office I'll be late today 
 Hoe I can thug it out, or starstud it out (fo' sho') 
 I take a trip with my bitch and Louis luggage out 
 I'm talkin' Magic City, or even Body Tap 
 You know that money ain't a thing we throwin' thousand stacks 
 Hoe yeah we toss it out, you know I'm talkin' 'bout (fo' sho') 
 When capo status in the house you know New York is out 
 (Unk) 
 Okay now do it how you do it, 'gwan and walk it out
