[Chorus:] 
 Eastside (ay), we ready we ready 
 Westside (ay), we ready we ready 
 Southside (ay), we ready we ready 
 North side (ay), we ready we ready 
 In yo face ouuuu 
 Look at em, and get 
 In yo face ouuu 
 Don't hate, I got it 
 In yo face ouuuu 
 Look at em, and get 
 In yo face ouuuu 
 I can't feel my face 
 [Verse 1:] 
 Move dog, I got this hill 
 You ain't heard, I run this hill 
 Big ol rappers cleaned up this shit (ahhhhh looky here looky here) 
 In yo face 
 I'm in the zone now 
 All of your things go home now 
 Bet you can't guess who owns now 
 Play with me now, I'm grown now (in yo face) 
 DJ Unk #1 in the game 
 How can my brother say these rented things 
 Keeping it real keeping it hood 
 And if someone falls, coming up to the game (in yo face) 
 Never ever let em make him doubt you man 
 You don't want him to move without you man 
 You might be the best come up in the game 
 Your on your ground, shortstop man (in yo face) 
 Under pressure I does this that why the fans just love it 
 I give them hugs in public (you over there man) 
 Yes, I'm a winner, I'm a stay on top 
 Throw it up cause this side don't flop 
 Again n again we won't stop [? ] 
 [Chorus:] 
 Eastside (ay), we ready we ready 
 Westside (ay), we ready we ready 
 Southside (ay), we ready we ready 
 North side (ay), we ready we ready 
 In yo face ouuuu 
 Look at em, and get 
 In yo face ouuu 
 Don't hate, I got it 
 In yo face ouuuu 
 Look at em, and get 
 In yo face ouuuu 
 I can't feel my face 
 [Verse 2:] 
 I'm starting you on the sideline 
 How does it feel to be around that pine 
 DVS'S you know they shine 
 You can get there, it'll just take your time 
 Can't stop this (In yo face) 
 We poppin bottles (In yo face) 
 Got top model (In yo face) 
 Man, I can't feel my face 
 According to now, there's part for one 
 I'll drop back and he gunna run 
 I think I'd see him rollout 
 Baby bootleg (pop them hands out) 
 The side pass gunna blow him out 
 The whole arena just sold out 
 Touchdown without time to waste, I do my thang (in yo face) 
 Can't get my size 
 Lose by ten, swallow up yo pride 
 We always win close games 
 Penetration ain't their side thang 
 Still I rise to butter your lane 
 Siren, she ain't got no game 
 Big ol records, we ain't goin to change 
 Where you from what side you claim 
 [Chorus:] 
 Eastside (ay), we ready we ready 
 Westside (ay), we ready we ready 
 Southside (ay), we ready we ready 
 North side (ay), we ready we ready 
 In yo face ouuuu 
 Look at em, and get 
 In yo face ouuu 
 Don't hate, I got it 
 In yo face ouuuu 
 Look at em, and get 
 In yo face ouuuu 
 I can't feel my face
