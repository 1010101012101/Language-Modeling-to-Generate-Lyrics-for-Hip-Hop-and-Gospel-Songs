Im poppin' my collar, 
 I'm grippin that wood, 
 My cush in my hand, 
 My trunk beatin' good. 
 If it's knockin' they jockin, 
 Feel that base that's a hobbie. 
 Beat through yo hood them kickers 
 Kick off in yo ass like karate. 
 They hear that base wanna try me, 
 I'm at greenbrief mall. 
 I pop my trunk, and all them hoes did the westside walk. 
 I'm wit monte' in assault, 
 System soundin so mean. 
 26's make it stretch, 
 Sittin' high like yao ming. 
 It go down 4 my team, 
 Trunk thumpin sum' crucial. 
 Bumpin p.s.c and t.i.p, 
 Hit the club crucial. 
 On my waist it's rugal. 
 Love my base and my amps, 
 Adjust ya tweakers make it sweeter, 
 Chain bright as a lamp (they feel me) 
 I'm beatin' down ya block, 
 And you can hear when I'm comin' (x4) 
 Can you feel me? (crank it up) 
 I know they feel me now.

 And I know that they can feel me 
 Half a block 4rm the hood.

 Yo trunk dnt sound so clear.

 Free wall chain let it bang (4 what?) 
 Shawty we here.

 Tope it scope it and bean. 
 Turn it up a knotch, 
 Bouncin' off the roof I'm clean. 
 Steaddy stackin my green, 
 Money high as a star. 
 And the best part about it 
 Is the base in my car. 
 (Then I heard) 4rm the amplifires, 
 Can't bust 'em 'cause my speakers built 4rm west coast customs. 
 Customized sounds trunk shakin the whole block. 
 TV screens in the dash, 
 Champ playin' the x-box. 
 Yep I'm beatin' down ya block, 
 4 4 duece sittin' tall, 
 Bend my hat back knockin' down pictures off ya wall 
 Atl comin' hard, 
 Beatin' hard in the drop top. 
 Old school chevy's color candy call it lollipop. 
 Cutlis wit the t top. 
 Buick wit the brains eye. 
 Ss impalas and cadillas stay pimped out. 
 Smoke dro then pill out. 
 Smash the gas in on my way. 
 Beatin' down ya block, 
 Fuck nigga get up out my way.
