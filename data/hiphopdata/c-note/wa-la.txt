(Feat. Will-Lean) 
 Wa-la [x4] 
 (Wa-la), when them diamonds in your face 
 (Wa-la), when we open up your safe 
 (Wa-la), two Rolexes 
 Keys to the Lexus, 3rd Coast Texas 
 C-Note: 
 Ready, willing and able 
 Fifty G's on the pool table, springs like a turntable 
 Steady spending, I'm steady grinning 
 I'm like the double O rocks, I keep winning 
 I'm outrageous, sick flow contagious 
 We independent, but we ball like the majors 
 Punk niggaz, tried to snatch my chain 
 So a nigga, had to snatch his brain 
 Broke through his hood clap his mayn, that's how we play it where I'm from 
 Niggaz bust a head with the lead, where I'm from 
 Uh, you end up dead where I'm from 
 Nigga better play it, how he said where I'm from 
 Now run and tell buddy, I'll leave your block muddy 
 Get to busting with this glock, and leave your spot bloody 
 Paparazzi, wanna take my picture 
 Close your eyes 'cause I come to get with ya, nigga coming to get ya 
 (Wa-la), when we kicking in the do' 
 (Wa-la), everybody on the flo' 
 (Wa-la), 'cause we coming with this roughness 
 Nigga you can't touch this, nigga this is thug shit 
 (Wa-la), when them diamonds in your face 
 (Wa-la), when we open up your safe 
 (Wa-la), two Rolexes 
 Keys to the Lexus, 3rd Coast Texas 
 Will-Lean: 
 Forever Botany, we back in the zone 
 Coming for the stacks you own, buried in back of your home 
 It's a jack and I'm gone, don't act and get chrome 
 Blocka-blocka, fifty caliber cracking your dome 
 I grabbed the cash and got gone, then jumped in the Jag on the phone 
 On 6-10 passing the Dome, mashing on chrome 
 It's on, say C-Note you should have seen this hoes 
 Left 'em bleeding on the flo', kicking and screaming bro 
 But first I got his hoe, then I got his do' 
 Manipulating bitches, for riches that's how it go 
 Wa-la, my ice stay forty below 
 That G-5 wagon on stage, that's part of my show 
 Air Force Ones and throwback jerseys, it's all part of my 'drobe 
 And every rapper you think platinum, they partially gold 
 Uh-huh it's the Chemist, I'm a lyrical threat 
 Taking shots like Clyde Drex, I'm a lyrical tech what 
 C-Note: 
 Wa-la, when I'm rolling the dice 
 Pull out the gambling Shaq, holding stacks and ice 
 Wa-la, when I fire up a blunt 
 Just like I came home, and I ain't smoked for months 
 Wa-la, we ain't playing with them boys 
 We spraying at them cars, when we run into them boys 
 Wa-la, it's C and Will-Lean 
 Sipping coedine, nigga we a thoed team 
 Will-Lean: 
 Wa-la, look at my rims they still spinning 
 Like the wheel of fortune, playboy I'm still winning 
 Wa-la, you see my cash flow 
 Convertible black Rolls, spinning on 84's 
 Wa-la, nigga keep your mouth shut 
 Snitches get chopped up, that's how we was brought up 
 Wa-la, we gon puff and take the wall out 
 Take your hoe swoll her out, and you all hauled out
