When I was fifteen years old 
 Straight dope game I was told 
 I went from selling pennies of the riders dank ah (riders dank ah) 
 Timin' ass think of slangin' crank (think of slangin' griqua) 
 Situation critical, phone home phone home 
 Talkin' on my digital call phone 
 Ya seen a boatload of situations for dangleations 
 Invalid ghetto pass late ass registrations 
 Boy I tell you shit is pitiful, damn! 
 Vocally repentable, dead right! 
 I try to stay away from artificial (artificial) 
 Plastic ass (plastic ass), pleather motherfuckin' individuals

 Keep your guard up 'cause fools be hard up 
 When you hittin' dips better check yo' clips and 
 Watch the police and the Bloods and the Crips

 Keep one in the chamber 'cause the shoes always loose 
 Rubber wheels beat rubber heels anyday 
 Put the green in your jeans and get the holes out ya halo 
 Or you can stay broke while your homies is rollin' smokes 
 And sippin' yak and smokin' dank and tellin' jokes, haha

 Ain't no busters or no suckers on my team or in my mattress 
 Just call me the Pimp 
 And you can call me the Rat 
 Watch my feet hit the tracks it, ain't no lookin' back

 But these niggaz don't know the half 
 Runnin' with riff raff but I got some game for your bitch ass 
 'Cause your game is weaker than an anorexic
