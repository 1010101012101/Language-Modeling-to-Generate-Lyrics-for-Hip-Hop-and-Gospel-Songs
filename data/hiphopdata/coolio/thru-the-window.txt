I take a look through the window and all I see is pain 
 Burnin' on my brain like some weird type of acid rain 
 Or a virus, it's something that I can't explain 
 I use to be different but now it seems that I'm the same 
 As the rest of these hard heads in my hood 
 I'm livin' foul even though Momma raised me good 
 Everywhere I turn it and everywhere I look 
 Everybody that I know is livin' like a crook 
 And the, the cops wanna throw the book 
 The kitchen sink, a upper cut and a left hook 
 How can I explain this battering that we caught 
 It wasn't the way I was raised, it was the way I was taught 
 And the streets is a motherfucker 
 But I be growin' up like another sucker 
 I say the bomb be the last as I reflect on the past 
 With my face, pressed against the glass 
 Goin' down slowly, slowly, goin' down 
 Goin' down slowly, slowly, goin' down 
 Goin' down slowly, slowly, goin' down 
 Goin' down slowly, slowly, goin' down 
 In nightfall through the window, a silhouette 
 Beads of sweat and the palm of my hand is still wet 
 So put the safety on the tek because this shootin' hasn't started yet 
 So many yesterdays I can't forget 
 And now it's night time but it seem like day time 
 Helicopter lights makin' the bud light like sunshine on my mind 
 Crack addicts, kids with automatics 
 Thugs who want static and those who already had it 
 Manifestations of a spirit, trapped in a flesh cage 
 Mind in fifth gear, imagination rampage 
 My brothers is walking through night like a thief in the night 
 Three strikes you're out because the color's not right 
 And all I ask is "Why we jack and fight?" 
 And try to save enough right and I'm wrapped too tight, uh 
 Blowin' in the pistol, suckin' on some indo, lookin' through the window 
 And that's all I see, uh 
 Goin' down slowly, slowly, goin' down 
 Goin' down slowly, slowly, goin' down 
 Goin' down slowly, slowly, goin' down 
 Goin' down slowly, slowly, goin' down 
 I'm hittin' corners on the boulevard, lookin' hard 
 Rims are shinin', sound is bumpin', I'm a superstar, yeah 
 Rollin' in the ride and it's not mine but 
 That's all right, 'cause I still feel fine 
 Now I'm strapped with nothin' but my mind and a screwdriver 
 Gimme twenty seconds at your skills like MacGyver 
 And I can take anything that I wanna take 
 But when you slip and push your fate, 
 I'm parlayin' off your paper like when I'm 
 Yankee Doodle came to Jersey rollin' on some Dayton's 
 Kept an Uzi under his seat so fools wouldn't take him 
 My homey had a Cadillac sweeter than all the others 
 Went into the wrong hood, so they choked the motherfucker 
 That's how it goes, yeah, and that's how it feels, right 
 New Jersey Drive is for real 
 That's how it goes and that's how it feels 
 New Jersey Drive is for real 
 Goin' down slowly, slowly, goin' down 
 Goin' down slowly, slowly, goin' down 
 Goin' down slowly, slowly, goin' down 
 Goin' down slowly, slowly, goin' down
