Toe to toe 
 Dancing very slow 
 Barely breathing 
 Almost comatose 
 Wall to wall 
 People hypnotized 
 And they're stepping 
 Lightly 
 Hang each night in 
 Rapture 
 Back to back 
 Sacrailiac 
 Spineless movement 
 And a wild attack 
 Face to face 
 Sadly solitude 
 And it's finger 
 Popping 
 Twenty-four hour shopping 
 In Rapture 
 Wat fine Freddie 
 Told me everybody's high 
 DJ's spinnin' 
 Are savin' my mind 
 Flash is fast, flash is cool 
 Francois says fas 
 Flashe' no do 
 And ya don't stop 
 Sure shot 
 Go out to the parking lot 
 And ya get in your car 
 And ya drive real far 
 And ya drive all night 
 And then ya see a light 
 And it comes right down 
 And lands on the ground 
 And out comes a man from Mars 
 And ya try to run 
 But he's got a gun 
 And he shoots ya dead 
 And he eats your head 
 And then you're in the man from Mars 
 You go out at night, eatin' cars 
 You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too 
 Mercurys and Subarus 
 And ya don't stop 
 You keep on eatin' cars 
 Then, when there's no more cars 
 You go out at night and eat up bars 
 Where the people meet 
 Face to face 
 Dance cheek to cheek 
 One to one 
 Man to man 
 Dance toe to toe 
 Don't move too slow 
 'Cause the man from Mars 
 Is through with cars 
 He's eatin' bars 
 Yeah, wall to wall 
 Door to door 
 Hall to hall 
 He's gonna eat 'em all 
 Rapture 
 We pure 
 Take a tour 
 Through the sewer 
 Don't strain your brain 
 Paint a train 
 You'll be singin' in the rain 
 I said don't stop 
 Do punk rock 
 Well now you see 
 What ya wanna be 
 Just have your party on TV 
 'Cause the man from Mars 
 Won't eat up bars 
 Where the TV's on 
 And now he's gone back up to space 
 Where he won't have a hassle with the human race 
 And ya hip-hop 
 And ya don't stop 
 Just blast off 
 Sure shot 
 'Cause the man from Mars 
 Stopped eatin' cars 
 And eatin' bars 
 And now he only eats guitars 
 Get up!
