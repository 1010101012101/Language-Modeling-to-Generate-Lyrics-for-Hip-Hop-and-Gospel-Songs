Intro: yo, I'm gonna talk to you about life for a minute (coolio) 
 Verse 1: I'm going to a chain 'cause it ain't the same 
 I remain no geak, life's just to play the game 
 Trying to brake this chain off my brain so I can gangsta change 
 Swinging with your things out without a name 
 A stranger is too much too beat but I ain't scared 
 I pray to god, hope he won't send me to the devils land 
 I hope that's not in heaven, trying to get my stand out 
 Hope my hopes and dreams don't burn in flames, but I'm aware 
 A life ain't promised, trying to avoid the drama 
 And live up the expectations for my dear old mama 
 Inside there's also a fool, inside the court building 
 Make a million maybe a billion we can save for our childeren 
 Face to face we trying to escape that but it's too late 
 So I grab the world and hope I don't have to wait, to get my strike 
 I've seen the life and all the pain and suffer 
 So I put my name in the book 
 Chorus: life x4 (what life) that's life life life (that's life) 
 Verse 2: ok now, here's the situation 
 I was raised in a good nation and given a formal education 
 My brothers and me lived in a fucked up area 
 Where the innocent life is shitty, lot of grey steam, it's a pitty 
 When you look over the steam you can miss me 
 Go ahead and talk but if you diss me 
 They have to come and get me 
 They wanna pimp me from my sin 
 Pretend they're down but they're against me 
 Think I touch everyone's heart until it's empty 
 Take my chance as a possibility, no touchdown for a century 
 Regreting me, feeling me, that's why I'm waiting in the bushes 
 If I don't than I delicate this to all pussies 
 Put yourself in my position, you don't know what you listen 
 In these conditions most likely a body comes up missing 
 When the lights come off, when you run away like mice 
 Than think twice if you don't hear your name from the book 
 Chorus: life x4 (what life) that's life life life (that's life) 
 Verse 3: can you handle friends, no my life is driving me insane 
 But I'm a man, so I remain steady, cought up in the game 
 Make a deal with dicky jane for a little change 
 Run from your home, banging with your things out 
 Tripping on everybody, cousin get your thing out, we're ready to roll 
 When it comes to, show no fear when they hunt you 
 If you have to use gun foo, they ask for the one-two 
 Everything but the kids n'sync, act quickly don't think 
 Don't sink to the level then you gonna leave with the devil 
 Be quick in the race and try to keep a straight face 
 And just when there's a new song I feel like I don't belong in this place 
 Hip hop is my profession, so I gotta keep on guessing 
 Make it black and white lack another in my session 
 Coming from the west, microphone is my blessing 
 So I'm testing, check it, I'm talking about life, that life 
 Chorus x2: life x4 (what life) that's life life life (that's life) 
 Outro: I'm just trying to live my life, you try to live your life 
 You want me to smack your face, give me my space 
 It's all about style, I know you got style, life is all about it 
 Nothing lives without life, my life, your life, coast to coast life
