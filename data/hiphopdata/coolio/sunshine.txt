Imagine looking at life through rose-tinted glasses 
 And the policy of the people is passive And all the women got fat asses 
 And all the homies got dubs and deeds to spend 
 And when the po-po's pass they wave and say "hi" 
 And wear a grin (hey) 
 And everybody that you meet is a potential friend 
 And the women in your life love you for yourself and not your ends 
 And the population's real so there's no reason to pretend 
 And ignore we are the same, so no one hates you for the colour of your skin 
 And every waking thought is one of peace and harmony and bliss 
 That simple satisfaction like a plate of eggs and grits 
 Senses fully alive like the feeling of a first kiss 
 And when it's check out time you got a smile on your lips, huh 
 And the whole world is like a next-door neighbour 
 Quick to do you a favour even though we come in a million different flavours 
 And I know there's not enough time to put it all in one rhyme 
 So I savour the flavour and sweet taste I feel from the rays of the sunshine 
 I'm sittin' in the sunshine 
 The sunshine, like the world was mine, the sunshine 
 I'm walkin' in the sunshine 
 The sunshine, like the world was mine, the sunshine 
 If love was a flower I'd spread the petals about the planet And plant seeds throughout every city and country 
 Even in those who do not want me 
 I try to make some sense of the situation that we call life 
 Some, verbal illustration to help ease this strife 
 Some, lyrical penetration to try to make things right 
 In hopes that what I'm saying can saturate your mindframe 
 And help you with the pain and the strain of the everyday struggle 
 I don't need it all, I
