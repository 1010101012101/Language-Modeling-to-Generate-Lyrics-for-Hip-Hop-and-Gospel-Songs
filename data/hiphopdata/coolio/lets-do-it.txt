Let's do it, get to it 
 Let's do it, get to it 
 Let's do it, get to it 
 Let's do it 
 Another Saturday night I'm feeling kind of smoky 
 I'm down with the phoney but I don't want no phobia 
 Eventhough I'm tursty and lonely at least I come up with "speak this" 
 But not up on my stomach I wanna doctor generic 
 I can't tell a lie, something on her eye, what a surprise 
 I called up the homies said let's go to the spot 
 Where the drinks ain't too cold and the girls ain't too hot 
 Now we're in the house but the house is kind of empty 
 Rax is running 'round the room, but wait I smoke too soon oh damn 
 Look what just walked in, pimps in ribbs it smells like them 
 Baby you look good with that cute dress on 
 Maybe someday me and you could be as one 
 Let's get to know eachother better 
 I can sing you a song and you can write me a love letter 
 Baby you can do it, take your time do it right 
 You can do it baby baby 
 Baby you can do it, take your time do it right 
 You can do it baby baby 
 Damn I'm feeling frisky, come and sit down with me 
 Conversation 'bout little hanky spanky and dranky wanky 
 Tell me about your inner thoughts, most needs and decides 
 And I tell you about mine, we can spend some quality time 
 You roll a man with the vision and the frame 
 Now listen in this mission I can hit the dirty dash 
 With thirtysix in my missile, but I just wanna bang little faster 
 How could you mama, have love for our daddy, any time at home 
 We're on the turcy bacon and riding in the benz 
 My name is on your named label now I am the man 
 I'm the doc then you can play the nurse 
 But we gotta have patients even though we have no anxiety 
 But they can show us the disease go off then 
 'Cause love don't come around here too often 
 So take my number and we get together later 
 And I take yours, all the numbers call me a raider 
 Baby you can do it, take your time do it right 
 You can do it baby baby 
 Baby you can do it, take your time do it right 
 You can do it baby baby 
 A few months with four more calls and some dinners 
 Moon late nights, go to bed and automatic love spinners 
 Top down in the watchin' wild Californian sunset 
 And when we zoom, what up, why don't you respect that we need it 
 So we use it 'cause our relationships is heated 
 Not above you, you know what I meaning 
 They started go with some kisses and some touches 
 Few more priests 'cause we don't wanna rush you 
 They say I'm fast sinner, no rasism 
 I'm a witness 'cause we all witness we all take the study cases 
 Hand in hand, what man to man 
 I know everything about her and she know everything about me 
 And we made love for the first time in a bad way 
 In a perfect state of mind 
 It's a whole lot more than your having smoked the grind 
 You better get yours 'cause I got mine 
 Baby you can do it, take your time do it right 
 You can do it baby baby 
 Baby you can do it, take your time do it right 
 You can do it baby baby 
 Baby you can do it, take your time do it right 
 You can do it baby baby 
 Baby you can do it, take your time do it right 
 You can do it baby baby 
 Take your time, take your time 
 Take your time, take your time 
 Take your time, take your time 
 Baby you can do it, take your time do it right 
 You can do it baby baby 
 Baby you can do it, take your time do it right 
 You can do it baby baby 
 Let's do it, get to it...
