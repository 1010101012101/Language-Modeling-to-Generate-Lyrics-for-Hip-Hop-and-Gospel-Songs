Intro [Truth]: 
 Hollyhood in the house 
 Los Angeles 
 Stand up 
 Verse 1 [Truth]: 
 I was having dreams laid out on the futon 
 Knocks on my mama's crib 
 They came thought suton 
 I couldn' t save my life even if I had a coupon 
 Four years later, now I'm back with my jewels on 
 Yeah I'm Mr. Hollyhood 
 Ain' t talkin' lights, camera 
 Money grow on fuckin' trees 
 Yeah I'm talkin' marijuana 
 I'm talkin' pistol hammer 
 Ain' t talkin' Trudy Zammer 
 I ain' t talkin' baking soda 
 But I got that arm and hammer 
 Yeah, she got a head game 
 She be playin' head games 
 Fuckin' with a real pimp 
 Dunkin on you hater legs 
 Sippin on that Haterade 
 Get yourself a minute maid 
 Makin' moves, getting praised 
 Switching lanes, interstate 
 Laker game ... the center, sittin' next to O Jack 
 Nothin' but fuckin' Truth puttin' on the cold act 
 Ridin' through the boulevard 
 All clear, no tip 
 And I got my stripes on 
 Like Jay on his girlfriend. 
 Chorus [Deuce]: 
 Here in LA, here in LA 
 All of our dreams come true, there's a reason 
 But we're here in LA, we're here in LA 
 So if ya see me, don' t be scared to greet me 
 Up here in LA, in LA. 
 Verse 2 [Truth]: 
 Hi I'm the Truth, rapper slash hustler 
 See the Benz parked 
 Blame it on the costumer 
 Ain' t talkin' safe sex 
 Homie but I stay strapped 
 Yes I'm the Chrysler I don' t come with gift wrap 
 I still come from Hollyhood 
 From my Mexicanos, right there by the fence 
 Right around McDonalds 
 Keys ain' t a problem, I push it like Alicia 
 Break it all down and charge it like a visa 
 Walkin' through Griffith Park 
 Sippin on that Kool-Aid 
 Yeah I got a PS3, you could blame the Blu-Ray 
 Yeah I love the Dodgers 
 Love 'em like the Vatos 
 Not a fan of the Rascoes 
 'Cause I don' t really fall for waffles 
 Atleast once a week I gotta have my tacos 
 First wrap I ever got I snatched it up from Carlos 
 Twenty-twenty vision yeah it's hard to be on me 
 'Cause alls on my face, you don' t see that I see. 
 Chorus [Deuce]: 
 Here in LA, here in LA 
 All of our dreams come true, there's a reason 
 But we're here in LA, we're here in LA 
 So if ya see me, don' t be scared to greet me 
 Up here in LA, in LA. 
 Verse 3 [Deuce]: 
 It's the city of dreams 
 Where people come and people go 
 It's the city of fiends 
 Where people runnin' for that blow 
 This city just needs a little love, little hope 
 And I ain' t talkin' snortin' a little bit of coke 
 Or tokin' on that dope runnin' from the po-po, 
 Oh no, been there and done that, so yo 
 Here's story that I like you to know 
 About my life and those I once rolled with 
 We used to go sip Alize with no mix, 
 Drink, catch a couple girls with some lip rings 
 And then joke about how we hit these, 
 And laugh and talk about how her shit stinks 
 Or how she ripped three queefs 
 And when I bent her over she would scream 
 (No, that's a big thing) 
 Oh shit, it's a he, it's a she 
 Here in LA, it's all the same to me. 
 Chorus [Deuce]: 
 Here in LA, here in LA 
 All of our dreams come true, there's a reason 
 But we're here in LA, we're here in LA 
 So if ya see me, don' t be scared to greet me 
 Up here in LA, in LA. 
 Bridge [Deuce and Truth]: 
 Goddamn it feels good to be back, 
 You've been so good to us 
 Here in LA, here in LA 
 Palm trees, fast cars, gangsters and hustlers 
 Only place you can find us at is... 
 Chorus [Deuce]: 
 Here in LA, here in LA 
 All of our dreams come true, there's a reason 
 But we're here in LA, we're here in LA 
 So if ya see me, don' t be scared to greet me 
 Up here in LA, in LA.
