Deuce 
 Haha, you fuckin' pussies 
 I'm a fuck with them a little on this one, jus' a little 
 You fuckin' posers 
 You know we don't stop 
 Reloadin' while we hit the top 
 I get down 'cause that's my job 
 Y'all better learn to walk the walk 
 You know we don't stop 
 Reloadin' while we hit the top 
 I get down 'cause that's my job 
 Y'all better learn to walk the walk 
 There's nothing you can do that'll make me angry 
 You can say the same shit, but I'll do the same thing 
 HU paved the way for me to make you crazy 
 Maybe I was sent here to make you take it in the ass 
 I'm back, it's Deuce, yoo hoo 
 You can tell that slut Ke$ha to shoo shoo 
 Oh boo boo, did I make you hate me? 
 Who knew that I'd be the one to make it? 
 Take this bitch, 'course I'm a rapist 
 I'm Satan mixed with a little Dre 
 It's like a little game, for you to say my name quick 
 'Cause I'm renegade, number 1 public enemy 
 You're a centipede, I'm the fire with melody 
 Remember me? I'm a fuckin' true OG 
 On your knees bitch, I'm a make you eat this 
 Don't speak when you're sucking on my penis trick 
 You know we don't stop 
 Reloadin' while we hit the top 
 I get down 'cause that's my job 
 Y'all better learn to walk the walk 
 You know we don't stop 
 Reloadin' while we hit the top 
 I get down 'cause that's my job 
 Y'all better learn to walk the walk 
 Gadjet 
 It's Gad to the Jet and I'll slap the shit 
 Outta any motherfucker, thinkin' they rappin' sick 
 You ain't as sick, I'm the sickest prick, ask my bitch 
 I fucked her raw and gave her Gono from my rashy dick 
 She traded me crabs and syphilis but homie that's not it 
 Got herpes too on purpose dude, I knew she had the shit 
 So what the fuck you gonna do to a masochist 
 Who's mad and pissed, crazy angry adjectives 
 Can describe or justify the way I laughs at death 
 It's Nine Lives, I kill my self it's not an accident 
 Focused like a terrorist, bomb strapped to my chest 
 Maybe I'll go play with razors while I slash my wrist 
 I'm dangerous on the stage, you had a mic, I snatched that shit 
 To Charlie Scene its probably mean, but I ain't mad at the kid 
 Deuce just put me in the booth, I'm better and faster than him 
 Tell the truth, you rather look at someone fatter or slim? 
 You know we don't stop 
 Reloadin' while we hit the top 
 I get down 'cause that's my job 
 Y'all better learn to walk the walk 
 You know we don't stop 
 Reloadin' while we hit the top 
 I get down 'cause that's my job 
 Y'all better learn to walk the walk 
 I got that forty five 
 Tucked under my seat, that's right (that's right) 
 I keep them pistols right by my side 
 'Case these fucks wanna die (you wanna die?) 
 You know you can't deny (you can't deny) 
 When the bullets go off, they fly (they fly) 
 Straight for your brain, I make 'em look nice (so nice) 
 We go have a lot of fun tonight 
 Yeah I'm young, but I'm still an OG 
 Them dudes might not, but they girlfriends know me 
 Dynamite hot so they tryna blow me 
 I'm a take it to the top and shit on rappers below me
