Oh 
 Don't Stop 
 What's my name girl, what's my name girl? (Deuce!) 
 Don't Stop 
 Shake that thang girl, shake that thang 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save me 
 Keep standin' by my side 
 'Cause you know you're mine 
 Yeah California, throw 'em up where you at 
 California, get ready I'm back 
 I keep it bumpin' like I'm black 
 Like Michael Myers, watch out the mask 
 I know you like what you see 
 Blitzin' and the 50 Tommy's all I need 
 You can visit me on the web 
 H-T-T-P, got your bitch on her knees 
 Dot com, I'm the bomb 
 If your friends with Tom, MySpace dot com 
 I'll give you what you need 
 Keep you dancin' all night like ecstasy 
 Everybody's doin' it baby 
 Everybody, everybody get crazy! (Crazy!) 
 We can dance, we can ride 
 Shake that ass, I got LA Pride 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save me 
 Keep standin' by my side 
 'Cause you know you're mine 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save me 
 Keep standin' by my side 
 'Cause you know you're mine 
 They want to get to know me 
 They all want to be my homies 
 I ain't no Timberlake 
 But I get more bitches at the end of the day 
 I'm shinin', shinin' everybody know's me 
 I'm grindin', grindin' they're saying, 'Oh lordy' 
 There he goes again, Oh yeah 
 Gettin' Kronked again, and you mad 
 You like my tats, my shoes, my hats 
 I'm back, I'm dressed in black 
 Your crew keeps wonderin' where I'm at 
 They keep thinkin' how I got so bad 
 I'm slippin' through the back door, mothafucka 
 We can ride, we can dance if you wanna 
 Or we can take it to the back 
 Watchin' little lady shake that ass 
 We can all get trashed 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save me 
 Keep standin' by my side 
 'Cause you know you're mine 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save me 
 Keep standin' by my side 
 'Cause you know you're mine 
 I don't stop for hoes, I don't stop for yos 
 Hollywood's got me crazed, that's fo sho 
 They don't like it when they see me with a 4-0 
 Gettin' tickets every night by the po-po 
 My rep goes back, it goes so far 
 I ain't got no cash, but you think I'm a star 
 Pullin' up in my fancy cars 
 I be gettin' all the fancy brauds 
 I did it all for the nooky, the nooky 
 I'm rollin', rollin' c'mon, Cookie 
 Don't think I'm here to get yours 
 I'm bad, I'm back, I'm here to get more 
 So keep gridin', bumpin', dancin' 
 Move how you wanna move 
 We can do it all night if you wanna grove 
 'Cause there ain't nothin' left to do 
 'Cept me and you, bitch 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save me 
 Keep standin' by my side 
 'Cause you know you're mine 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save me 
 Keep standin' by my side 
 'Cause you know you're mine
