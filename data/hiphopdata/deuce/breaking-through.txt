Fight, fight with me 
 We'll make it through, through again 
 Now, now I see 
 Where I'm gone 
 Gone to find my home 
 Lonely crawling through these dark walls 
 Finding hope if hope still exists 
 But I can see the things you put me through 
 I felt this way 
 I felt this way for so long 
 And all the pain I felt in this life 
 Gone in this 
 Losing in this game of life now 
 I lost you before 
 I felt so much pain 
 And now I wanna say goodbye to all those times we fought 
 Those times you were by my side 
 I felt like this wasn't real 
 Like I was living in someone else's dream 
 My home 
 My home 
 My home 
 And I know that you can't see the future 
 Because it's lost 
 And now I've seen it in the past 
 And I fear that 
 There's nothing left for me 
 Or left for you 
 Or left for god to live for 
 I won't give up on the future 
 But I can see the things you put me through 
 I felt this way 
 I felt this way for so long 
 And all the pain I felt in this life 
 Gone in this x2
