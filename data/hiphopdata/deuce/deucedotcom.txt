Oh, don't stop, what's my name girl, what's my name girl? (Deuce!) 
 Don't stop, shake that thing girl, shake that thing 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save it 
 Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine 
 Yeah, California throw 'em up where you at? 
 California get ready, I'm back 
 I keep it bumping like I'm black 
 Like Michael Myers watch out the mask 
 I know you like what you see 
 Blitzin' and the 50 Tommy all I need 
 You can visit me on the web 
 H-T-T-P got your bitch on her knees 
 Dot com, I'm the bomb 
 If you're friends with Tom, myspace dot com 
 I give you what you need 
 Keep you dancing all night like ecstacy 
 Everybody's doin' it baby 
 Everybody everybody get crazy 
 We can dance, we can ride 
 Shake that ass, I got L.A. pride 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save it 
 Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save it 
 Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine 
 They want to get to know me 
 They all want to be my homies 
 I ain't no Timberlake 
 But I got more bitches at the end of the day 
 I'm shinin' shinin' everybody know me 
 I'm grindin' grindin' they're saying 'Oh Lordy' 
 There he goes again, oh yeah 
 Gettin' crunked again and you mad 
 You like my ties, my shoes, my hats 
 I'm back, I'm dressed in black 
 Your crew keeps wonderin' where I'm at 
 They keep thinkin' how I got so bad 
 I'm slippin' through the back door motherfucker 
 We can ride, we can dance if ya wanna 
 Or we can take it to back 
 Watchin' little lady shake that ass we can all get trashed 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save it 
 Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save it 
 Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine 
 I don't stop for hoes, I don't stop for yos 
 Hollywood's got me crazed, that's fo sho 
 They don't like it when they see me with the 4-O 
 Gettin' tickets everynight by the po-po 
 My rep goes back it goes so far 
 I ain't got no cash, but you think I'ma star 
 Pulling up in the fancy car I be gettin' all the fancy broads 
 I did it all for the nooky the nooky 
 I'm rollin' rollin' 
 Come on cookie 
 Don't think I'm here to get yours 
 I'm bad, I'm back 
 I'm here to get more 
 Keep grindin', bumpin', dancin' 
 Move how you wanna move 
 We can do it all night if ya wanna groove 
 'Cause there ain't nothing left to do 'cept for me and you bitch 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save it 
 Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine 
 We can ride if you wanna ride, later 
 We can dance if you wanna dance, baby 
 I don't care if you gotta man, save it 
 Keep standing by my side 'cause you know you're mine
