Deuce, I think I see dead people... 
 (9 Lives!) 
 I, gonna take it to the grave, 
 I, gonna run this rap game, 
 I, gonna make you feel the pain, 
 It's hip hop, and it ain't gonna be the same. 
 I, gonna take it to the grave, 
 I, gonna run this rap game, 
 I, gonna make you feel the pain, 
 It's hip hop, and it ain't gonna be the same. 
 Black Chucks, black gloves, done with the different plates, 
 I'm the bomb, like grenades, blowin' up in your face. 
 Blowin' on that fuckin' haze, none of this is new to me, 
 9Lives mother fucker been 'bout the jewelry, 
 All day at the range work- 
 In on my game. 
 For, for, my fucking back seat game plan, 
 My screws ain't loose homie, listen, he missin', 
 The click steady ticking rinding while I'm grinding, 
 Kinda cloudy in the outer city sittin' on some new wheels, 
 Gotta get bottle of a bottle of them perscribed pills, 
 Poundin' on that brown liquor tryin' not to lose it, 
 I ain't the type to flash that pistol unless I'mma use it, 
 Forty laws of power brushin' through my memory, 
 All this hate around me givin' me that energy, 
 I don't sleep, I like naps, money bring power, 
 Gotta get this dough, I ain't talkin' 'bout the flour. 
 I, gonna take it to the grave, 
 I, gonna run this rap game, 
 I, gonna make you feel the pain, 
 It's hip hop, and it ain't gonna be the same. 
 I, gonna take it to the grave, 
 I, gonna run this rap game, 
 I, gonna make you feel the pain, 
 It's hip hop, and it ain't gonna be the same. 
 See me in traffic, maybe we can smoke in a blunt. 
 While malcom's in the middle, you can catch me in the front, 
 You can learn a thing or two, I'm givin' out lessons, 
 The Truth mother fucker's got answers to questions, 
 Same year my father died my choice was limited, 
 Don't try to put my sneakers on unless you can fit in 'em. 
 Running out of options, there ain't nothing I can ask for, 
 You ain't flying till you got stamps in your passport, 
 I ain't no photographer, you'll never catch me flash, 
 I plain ol' Jason without the mother fucking mask, 
 Real funny how these freaks are sucking on that plastic, 
 Ain't nobody faithful, black door, paper clips, 
 Keep digging lil' hamster, punk bitch rat cats. 
 Speak when you're spoken to, maybe I might answer. 
 I drive blind, quiet down all the fucking noise, 
 Respect your elders, I ain't playin' wit'cha boys. 
 I, gonna take it to the grave, 
 I, gonna run this rap game, 
 I, gonna make you feel the pain, 
 It's hip hop, and it ain't gonna be the same. 
 I, gonna take it to the grave,

 I, gonna make you feel the pain, 
 It's hip hop, and it ain't gonna be the same. 
 All my life, been alone, I don't need no damn help, 
 Shadow Boxing while they're talkin' all about my damn wealth, 
 California King Koosh growin' right fucking thick, 
 Money in the swiss bank, jewels in the fish tank, 
 Gotta problem with me I'm gonna shoot it through your fuckin' polo, 
 In my pool, call me dodo, I'll make the perfect photo. 
 I'mma gonna keep a Desert Eagle while I'm creepin' through the night, 
 Cops come around, I'm gonna shake'em up like I'm shooting dykes, 
 Crooks say "Sup" like a snake watching rattle, 
 I'm too much to handle it, go to church, burn a candle, 
 Must be like spilled milk the way these kids cry, 
 I can see it through their teeth, the way these kid's lie, 
 The Truth got night vision, all he see is fuckin' green, 
 As shit pop off like a type to cause a scene, 
 I fucked her in the back room, black hair, red cool. 
 Came and turned Hollywood into Cancum. 
 I, gonna take it to the grave, 
 I, gonna run this rap game, 
 I, gonna make you feel the pain, 
 It's hip hop, and it ain't gonna be the same. 
 I, gonna take it to the grave,
