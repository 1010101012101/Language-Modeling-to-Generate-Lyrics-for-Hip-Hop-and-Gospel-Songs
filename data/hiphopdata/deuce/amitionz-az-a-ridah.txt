 Ayo Deuce where the pistols at 
 And I won't deny it I'm a straight ridah

 And I remember you was beggin on your knees 
 And I won't deny it I'm a straight ridah

 Cause yous a bitch just like the police 
 And I remember you was beggin on your knees 
 I pray to lord tell him to forgive me for my sins 
 Not a ticket to the heaven just to my own born kids 
 I'm addicted to the fast life money and drugs 
 Plus you can't forget the bitches in cali showin their stuff 
 I smoke weed pop pills never catch me shooting them up 
 I'm a product of prison behind walls is where I grew up 
 Getting money fuckin' bitches bow down to nomad 
 9Lives newsflash get with the program 
 Ain't nobody invisible ain't nobody can get it 
 Ain't fuck the world homie it's the people that's in it 
 And if you a rat homie I got pistol for that 
 All that woofin in my ear, where that paper or gat 
 When you think it's all over, lights out I'm gone 
 I got 9 lives homie correct me if I'm wrong 
 All eyes on me till I return 
 The Truth nothing else, my word is my bond 
 And I won't deny it I'm a straight ridah 
 You won't fuck with me 
 Cause yous a bitch just like the police 
 And I remember you was beggin on your knees 
 And I won't deny it I'm a straight ridah 
 You won't fuck with me 
 Cause yous a bitch just like the police 
 And I remember you was beggin on your knees 
 Leaders ain't got no fuckin' mercy for their enemies 
 Plus I'm livin' all your fuckin' dreams and your fantasies 
 I got some G's that'll make you wanna take a felony 
 I got some G's that'll bleak you up or make you believe 
 Whoa! Don't get it twisted I'm just tryna keep it friendly yo 
 Go to church, keep it real, that's my antidote 
 But I'm Aron I just wanna be in Hollywood Undead though 
 I think I'm really cool 'cause I can sip on four ho's 
 Until my mommy gets so mad at me and sends me home 
 I'm everything everyone wanted to be 
 In Hollywood everyone keeps on callin for me 
 To disgrace you ain't even gotta bet a TV ha! 
 I turn bitches into monkeys and apes 
 Voodoo dolls, brass knuckles I got magic for days 
 If I can smell your girls vagina from a mile away 
 Then I can give you brain damage on any given day 
 And I won't deny it I'm a straight ridah 
 You won't fuck with me 
 Cause yous a bitch just like the police 
 And I remember you was beggin on your knees 
 And I won't deny it I'm a straight ridah 
 You won't fuck with me 
 Cause yous a bitch just like the police 
 And I remember you was beggin on your knees 
 Now I'mma confess you can bet that I'mma do what I gotta do 
 The thug in me nigga got me sporting this colla blue 
 Bailing through niggas hate the color for fuckin' ball 
 Real keep it real I don't bang I set it off 
 And got hood less so I grew through this bitch 
 Like it don't mean shit still tryna get rich 
 And got bad habits So I'm pleasing my addictions 
 With a chronic and convalesce 8 along with these bitches 
 I'm hood homie so all eyes on me 
 When I'm bailing down the block 
 That's why I'm glued to my glock 
 And bring pain like rain fuck an umbrella 
 It's GML up in this bitch so when you fuckin' tell it 
 Say it right bitch now don't fuck around 
 I'm on the people got it locked like Nero Brown 
 And I won't deny it I'm a straight ridah

 Cause yous a bitch just like the police 
 And I remember you was beggin on your knees 
 And I won't deny it I'm a straight ridah 
 You won't fuck with me
