This is for you fags, when you ride 
 Don't approach me 
 This is for you fucks, when you die 
 Don't approach me 
 Go and run your mouth, when your high 
 Don't approach me 
 You're lookin' like a bitch 
 You're a coward 
 You ain't shit 
 You feel the fuckin' flame in my heart (yup yup) 
 Machiavelli's got me evil so evil, so weak but so strong 
 A lady named Sie's got my secrets my spirits 
 And you gon' have to kill her to defeat me 
 Yeah give me one, give me two, three, four, five shots 
 While I'm rollin' in the Benz 
 With the Truth (pop pop) 
 A shotgun in the back 
 Yeah it's loaded, yeah it's cocked 
 Hollywood! Throw your hands up, where you at? 
 I ain't got no fuckin' knives on my fingers 
 Just ten broken bones on your throat till you ain't breathin' 
 Yeah you know where I live 
 You're a bitch, you got shit 
 Take your best shot 
 On the west side, I got 9 lives 
 Try to see through my eyes, no you can't, nope 
 Watch my pearly whites shine while I laugh 
 You better catch me in the club fallin' down 
 Don't need a 9 to take your one life 
 This is for you fags, when you ride 
 Don't approach me 
 This is for you fucks, when you die 
 Don't approach me 
 Go and run your mouth, when your high 
 Don't approach me 
 You're lookin' like a bitch 
 You're a coward 
 You ain't shit 
 (x2) 
 Just remember I ain't stoppin' for nothin' 
 Made it from nothin' to somethin' 
 Feel the best pop somethin' up and then I see you hidin' and runnin' 
 You know it's cause your days keep on runnin' 
 You hear my shit when it's bumpin' 
 And pray to god I ain't comin' 
 I bleed a little bit of me 
 When I speak I'm speaking to my enemies 
 Ain't no heroes in this life of mine 
 Ain't no fuckin' rhyme that be written how I feel inside 
 You gon' fuckin' hear when I'm speakin' 
 When I'm heated, heated like a 9 millimeter 
 There ain't no fuckin' pictures here left to paint homie 
 Except the portrait of Mrs. (cut off) wanting to blow me 
 I can joke if you wanna joke 
 We can go to the throat till your bleedin' 
 And your heart won't flow 
 No matter the place 
 No matter the time 
 No matter the race 
 I'm leavin' you hatin' me cause there ain't no unchanging me 
 I'm the whitest of the white 
 The rawest of the raw 
 I'm laughing on the inside screaming fuck you all 
 (Cut off) better come and change my shit bitch 
 So twenty three attorney general can suck my dick 
 While I'm sittin' in the back of a white and black Vick chained up 
 And I still don't give a shit 
 This is for you fags, when you ride 
 Don't approach me 
 This is for you fucks, when you die 
 Don't approach me 
 Go and run your mouth, when your high 
 Don't approach me 
 You're lookin' like a bitch 
 You're a coward 
 You ain't shit
