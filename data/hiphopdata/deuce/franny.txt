You helped me see 
 When there was so much in me 
 You helped me believe 
 When there was something to be 
 And I don't mind if there's nothing to say 
 Because in the end we'll always be the same 
 And I don't mind if there's nowhere to stay 
 Because in the end we'll always find our way! 
 Is this me? Is this you? 
 So hard to understand this world 
 Is it true? Will be soon? 
 So hard to understand 
 You helped me see 
 When there was so much in me 
 You helped me believe 
 When there was something to be 
 And I don't care what you say to me 
 Or run away until the sun starts to piss 
 And I don't care how you look at me 
 We'll run today until we're far away! 
 Is this me? Is this you? 
 So hard to understand this world 
 Is it true? Will be soon? 
 So hard to understand 
 Is this me? Is this you? 
 So hard to understand this world 
 Is it true? Will be soon? 
 So hard to understand 
 Is this me? Is this you? 
 You helped me see 
 Is it true? Will be soon? 
 You helped me believe
