Never was a killer 
 But I spilt enough blood 
 Never thought 
 I'd be the one 
 To sweep your fuckin' ashes underneath my rug. 
 People come 
 And people go 
 But I ain't people, 
 So tell your people when they see me 
 They gonna feel the evil 
 You missed the past 
 Thought them city lights 
 Would make you last 
 Now you're saying Rest In Peace 
 Packin' all your bags 
 Say goodbye, say goodbye 
 But save your last dance 
 Take your last glance at me now 
 It's your chance! 
 Goodbye, goodbye 
 Everything will be all right 
 Goodbye, goodbye 
 I promise I'll be by your side 
 Goodbye, goodbye 
 Rest in Peace alone 
 I wouldn't put a fuckin' flower on your gravestone 
 (If you died) 
 I used to be the boy 
 The only boy my mama had 
 Now I'm sitting in this house 
 Underneath the past 
 Cleaning out where we used to drink and laugh 
 Thinking what happened 
 How'd it happen? 
 How I didn't see the past 
 Seemed like it all happened all too fast 
 Think inside was my mask 
 I was caught up lost in the mask 
 Now it's dark 
 And now it's black 
 I miss the contrast 
 You say it's black and white 
 Black and white my ass! 
 And in these moments 
 I've been wrong 
 These moments seem so long 
 Ticking on the clock 
 Till the moments gone 
 And now I don't wanna go back 
 Relapse the day 
 Collapse the phase 
 While I'm looking down the drain 
 Goodbye, goodbye 
 Everything will be all right 
 Goodbye, goodbye 
 I promise I'll be by your side 
 Goodbye, goodbye 
 Rest in Peace alone 
 I wouldn't put a fuckin' flower on your gravestone 
 (If you died) 
 See my conscience don't work no more 
 It don't hurt no more 
 And it don't hurt to see you lying 
 It don't work no more 
 So when I'm saying "stay away" 
 Realize I ain't fuckin' playing 
 Younger, let my younger days 
 May be hungry but I'm crazed 
 Raised by criminal ways 
 Hear the chandelier break 
 It ain't no mistake 
 I'm waiting on Alana's grave 
 Inking pictures from my veins 
 Ain't a fuckin' need for change? 
 Naked for my brothers rain 
 On my arm and you'll see the same 
 And if I never see your face 
 I will always feel the same 
 Divide me from the wrongs 
 So when I'm gone 
 My spirit will live on 
 Let my lyrics show you God! 
 Goodbye, goodbye 
 Everything will be all right 
 Goodbye, goodbye 
 I promise I'll be by your side 
 Goodbye, goodbye 
 Rest in Peace alone 
 I wouldn't put a fuckin' flower on your gravestone 
 (If you died)
