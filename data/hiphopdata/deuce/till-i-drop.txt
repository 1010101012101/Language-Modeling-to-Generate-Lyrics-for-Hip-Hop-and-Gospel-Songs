Those fools are never gonna rap again 
 Yeah, we go push all you mother fuckers back 
 It ain't over till it's over man 
 Revenge is like a mother fucker, ain't it? 
 Nine lives 
 Love me or hate me but I ain't stoppin' till I'm on top 
 I'm screamin' 'fuck the world' like Tupac 
 Say my name and you might get shot 
 It's Nine lives mutha' fucka' till I drop 
 When the guns go off they pop 
 We leave your body outlined in chalk 
 If you talk you better learn to walk the walk, 
 'Cause its Nine lives mutha' fucka' till I drop 
 They call me scante bigante 
 OK I'm reloadin' 
 Sticks let the drum spray 
 Damn that flake got me loaded 
 Catch a standin' ovay 
 Clap until your up and open 
 Daddy bring the heat out 
 Someone leave the oven open? 
 Bitch who you kiddin' 
 We be hotter than a sun blaze 
 So fuckin' fly I don't even need a run way 
 Blunts full of kush 
 I be steamin till my lungs cave 
 Gotta, gotta get paid 
 Now fuck someday 
 Blocks of the chalk 
 And a spoon full of H (aye) 
 Stay with more choppers 
 Than the mutha fuckin' HA's 
 True call up deuce like dude what it do 
 Look pops for the loot 
 Ain't no tellin' what I'll do 
 I cock aim and shoot 
 HU I see you 
 No ICU in the world that save you 
 I be all about the paper 
 Baggin up the yaper 
 On my barbershop shit 
 Give da brick a taper 
 Nine lives 
 Love me or hate me but I ain't stoppin' till I'm on top 
 I'm screamin' 'fuck the world' like Tupac 
 Say my name and you might get shot 
 It's Nine lives mutha' fucka' till I drop 
 When the guns go off they pop 
 We leave your body outlined in chalk 
 If you talk you better learn to walk the walk, 
 'Cause its Nine lives mutha' fucka' till I drop 
 You can love me or hate me, I don't give a fuck 
 What you tryin' a date me? Either way either you on my nuts, but 
 Whateva' you thinkin' won't stop this supa' star, 
 This world is mine to rape, fuck it like stupid groupie broads 
 Use a magnum extra-large but I'd ooh rather do it raw, 
 These pussy rappin' faggots sissy bastards really turn me on 
 And I'm gonna stick it to 'em, man my dick is gettin' hard, 
 Fuck 'em all and I'm a prove it while I do it like it's my job 
 If it is I stick my dick up in this biz to get it off, 
 While I'm ticklin' the clitoris by stickin' it in soft, 
 Just to trick 'em like I'm fickle and its possible I'm fluff, 
 But my dick is quick to switch the brick and give it to 'em rough 
 I'm a sick and twisted son of a bitch, no disrespect to mom, 
 But she gave birth to a kid way worse than Dahmer, bin Laden, or Saddam 
 Persistent I'm a sadistic killer ready to uni-bomb 
 Gadget, if faggots want static tell they asses to bring it on 
 Nine lives 
 Love me or hate me but I ain't stoppin' till I'm on top 
 I'm screamin' 'fuck the world' like Tupac 
 Say my name and you might get shot 
 It's Nine lives mutha' fucka' till I drop 
 When the guns go off they pop 
 We leave your body outlined in chalk 
 If you talk you better learn to walk the walk, 
 'Cause its Nine lives mutha' fucka' till I drop 
 I spew hate in every direction I spit, 
 I'm tearin' it down, everything you built 
 I already found my niche, snitches 
 Ain't never gonna stop me, this is it 
 I can hear my voice bitch, 
 Everyone knows I'm on fire, shit, 
 It's the reason why these white kids buy this 
 There's no more Undead, its Nine lives, 
 This punk-ass better go home or retire, with his mama 
 'Cause its already to late to stop what I did 
 It hurts when I rip this mic' up, slap you upside 
 And call you 'my bitch' if you can't play the game fucker 
 Better stand outside it 
 You ain't never gonna have no fame again, 
 Both you and your boyfriend in bed 
 Look at these faggots, how I beat them with 
 Just the touch of a pen 
 I could' a smacked you hard but I tapped you bitch 
 And wrote this song instead, like I said in story of a snitch, 
 We are not best friends 
 I almost flew over the cuckoo's nest, I had to get shit off my chest, 
 You tried to push my ass off the edge, but I got Nine lives homey, 
 I ain't dead 
 I came to party, I came to party 
 Hands up girl give me that body 
 I can tell you want somethin' from me, 
 'Cause everything you think girl I can see 
 I came to party, I came to party 
 Hands up girl give me that body 
 I'm a make you mine before I leave, 
 'Cause every little thing you do to me, 
 Got me goin' crazy
