Deuce 
 I thought I told ya, I came to party. 
 Hey bartender, can I get a cup? 
 Tonight's my night and I'm gettin' fucked up. 
 I hope I still got the charm, got the luck, 
 'Cause all these bitches and hoes look like so much fun. 
 Travie McCoy 
 And I just stepped in the club, 
 Feelin' my self like a braille book, 
 Double-fistin' two pitchers of pale ale, 
 Both stale as fuck. 
 And all these busted females 
 Lined up at the bathroom, 
 In and out, we know what they doin'. 
 Deuce 
 I came to party, I came to party. 
 Hands up girl, give me that body. 
 I can tell you want somethin' from me, 
 'Cause everything you think girl I can see. 
 I came to party, I came to party. 
 Hands up girl, give me that body. 
 I'm a make you mine before I leave, 
 'Cause every little thing you do to me, 
 Got me goin' crazy. 
 I thought I told ya, I came to party. 
 Let's have a party girl, you can bring your friends tonight, 
 After the club, we can play all the games you like. 
 Yeah the stakes are high, but if your cards are right, 
 You'll be wakin' up naked; what happened last night? 
 Travie McCoy 
 Too bad you're, just another notch in the bedpost, tryin' a get close and cuddly. 
 My girl stays in Brooklyn, you just my west-coast fuck buddy. 
 Get that through your skull girl, I'm here for one night, 
 And please quit fuckin' up my buzz 'cause...

 Ya I came, I came, to party 
 Truth 
 Sip, sip, sip, sip, sippin' on some bomb shit, 
 Tick, tick, tick, tick, it's about that time bitch. 
 Sip, sip, sip, sip, we party hard and never quit, 
 West coast, east coast, yeah you lovin' it. 
 Sip, sip, sip, sip, sippin' on some bomb shit,
