I wanna party every day till I can't see straight 
 A new girl, each city, coming your way 
 Always getting fucked up till I'm puking out my brains 
 As long as I'm a rock star, nothing's gonna change 
 Strippers in the morning, liquor all day 
 Yeah, when I'm feeling horny, groupies got a brain 
 Always wear a condom, gotta play it safe 
 When the show's over, they come out to play 
 I go right past touching first base 
 As long as you got an itty-bitty waist 
 And got a nice little, itty-bitty frame 
 You know I'll do bad things to that little, pretty face 
 From LA to Tokyo 
 New York City, around the globe 
 First, you see me, but now you don't 
 Catch me if you can 
 I'm gone, bitch, all over the map 
 Not stopping, never going back 
 I'll never, ever give a damn 
 Catch me if you can 
 I won't quit, it's not who I am 
 Ain't hard for you to understand 
 Like a lion to a lamb 
 Catch me if you can 
 I'm on top of the world, got money to burn 
 Went from bad to worse, rocking your girl 
 These bitches sporting my t-shirts 
 They be falling off when you see 'em crowd surf 
 Every night is just a blur 
 Keep sipping vodka until it hurts 
 Backstage with the one in the mini-skirt 
 Bring her back to the trailer, so we can get to work 
 I promise you it ain't gonna hurt 
 I'll be the patient, you can be the nurse 
 Switch it all around, we can both take turns 
 Gonna make sure you get what you're worth 
 From LA to Tokyo 
 New York City, around the globe 
 First, you see me, but now you don't 
 Catch me if you can 
 I'm gone, bitch, all over the map 
 Not stopping, never going back 
 I'll never, ever give a damn 
 Catch me if you can 
 I won't quit, it's not who I am 
 Ain't hard for you to understand 
 Like a lion to a lamb 
 Catch me if you can 
 Catch me if you can, every day's Friday 
 Friday, bitch, I'm the new Rebecca Black 
 Driving down that highway my way 
 Brand new tour bus with some warm ones in the back 
 Where we go is where the fun's at 
 And by fun, I mean getting in your pants 
 You know how we always keep getting out of hand 
 And how I keep the party rocking all frigging year, damn 
 From LA, from LA, from LA to Tokyo 
 New York City, around the globe 
 Catch me if you can 
 I'm gone, bitch, all over the map 
 Not stopping, never going back 
 I'll never, ever give a damn 
 Catch me if you can 
 I won't quit, it's not who I am 
 Ain't hard for you to understand 
 Like a lion to a lamb 
 Catch me if you can 
 I'm all over the map 
 Never going back 
 Too hard for you to understand? 
 Catch me if you can 
 I'm gone, bitch, all over the map 
 Not stopping, never going back 
 I'll never, ever give a damn 
 So throw your hands in the air 
 And wave 'em all around like you just don't care 
 If you's a true player, we'll play Truth or Dare 
 If you want fun and games, well, they're over here 
 So throw your face down, right down here 
 And wave it all around like you just don't care 
 'Cause I'm a real player who never plays fair 
 We can all have fun, we all like to share
