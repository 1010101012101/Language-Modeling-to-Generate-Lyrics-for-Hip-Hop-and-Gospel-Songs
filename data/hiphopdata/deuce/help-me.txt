(Release the kraken--w-w-wait one second--all the girlies with the--*beep*) 
 Hello? 
 Yes, hello, uh Aron, Deuce, are you there? 
 Hey yeah! What's up! 
 So a little birdie tells me you're working on a new record, is that true? 
 B-Birdy, yeah, Birdy? 
 What the fuck are you thinking!? 
 (Music begins playing) 
 Uh... I'm very busy, I'm doin' shit you know? 
 What the fuck is goin' on through your brain? We're big due, you know that? We're a fucking major label! You ain't going to be starting your own band! 
 (Arguing) 
 I'm a trash that record! No radio! You ain't not coming out without my permission! I'm a bury you boy, I'm a bury you! 
 Help me, I ain't got no brains, 
 Help me, I can't feel no pain, 
 Help me, I can't stand the rain, 
 Help me before I drift away! 
 Help me, I ain't got no brains, 
 Help me, I can't feel no pain, 
 Help me, I can't stand the rain, 
 Help me before I drift away! 
 I'm the George Bush of this rap shit, 
 You can tell Randy Jackson to kiss my black ass. 
 I'm the white Obama bitch, 
 You could judge this when I flip my middle finger up and let one out quit. 
 I'm sick of these people trying to tell me what I got, 
 Like these thousand drums that makes you want a little click. 
 Put 'em around in there, make 'em drown in with, 
 These other rap stars who are like clowns it's sick. 
 Like Monica Lewinsky when she's sucking on a 6 inch toothpick bitch, 
 Bitch just got her boobs in so she can do it do it, make a new clip. 
 While these kids are downloading and he sounds profound, 
 Shit I ain't going down with my hand on my dick 
 While the next World Trade Center blows up quick, 
 Hold up, I think you need another doughnut Mr. Officer, everybody go nuts! 
 Help me, I ain't got no brains, 
 Help me, I can't feel no pain, 
 Help me, I can't stand the rain, 
 Help me before I drift away! 
 Help me, I ain't got no brains, 
 Help me, I can't feel no pain, 
 Help me, I can't stand the rain, 
 Help me before I drift away! 
 Look what I've become, this place I've begun, 
 Started as The One and still don't give a fuck. 
 These bitches getting love, no more Grenade or Dove, 
 You thirty, rappin' *blech*, you still ain't gotta buzz. 
 You can dream, you can dream but you going to suck, 
 I got the voice and the lips baby turn it up. 
 I don't need MTV when I sell this much, 
 I'd rather be on Carson Daly than Oprah, son. 
 I'm a be better than Em, I'm a veteran, kid, 
 Get these kids off of medicine binges. 
 Who's better than him? Not Ollirum, that bitch, 
 I told you once and I'm a tell you again. 
 At least fight back, pussy, give me a challenge, 
 I'm the boss motherfucker, you don't want no static. 
 B-O-S-S, Deuce is back bitch, 
 Yo Truth (What's up?), pass the automatic! 
 Help me, I ain't got no brains, 
 Help me, I can't feel no pain, 
 Help me, I can't stand the rain, 
 Help me before I drift away! 
 Help me, I ain't got no brains, 
 Help me, I can't feel no pain, 
 Help me, I can't stand the rain, 
 Help me before I drift away! 
 Yeah! 
 These labels want to put me away for good, 
 They wanna keep me in the hood. 
 But I keep swinging right back like you know I should, 
 Making history in the books. 
 You suck, there's no buts, 
 The whole music industry can lick my nuts. 
 Motherfucker, I ain't got no love 
 For a fake-ass wannabe Donald Trump! 
 Deuce, don't forget you signed my fucking contract! You do what I say, you're not making them famous! You're not fucking bitches without my permission! 
 Help me, I ain't got no brains, 
 Help me, I can't feel no pain, 
 Help me, I can't stand the rain, 
 Help me before I drift away! 
 Help me, I ain't got no brains, 
 Help me, I can't feel no pain, 
 Help me, I can't stand the rain, 
 Help me before I drift away! 
 Uh huh, uh huh! 
 Yeah I ain't even got to fucking try! 
 You know why? 
 'Cause I sound good whenever I talk, whenever I spit, whenever I sing, bitch. 
 I'm the fucking white Obama bitch! Yeah! 
 Hey Yuma, let's get the fuck outta here!
