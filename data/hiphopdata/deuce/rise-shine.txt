Rain rain won't go away 
 Cloud on my head every single day 
 This pain pain goes right inside 
 Breaking me down 'til I just cry 
 Little bully wants to play 
 Hits me every single day 
 Pain, pain go right inside 
 Guess I'll just have to let it slide 
 Drain drain all my life 
 Why can't I just stop this strife 
 Rain rain, won't go away 
 Cloud on my head every single day 
 Beat on another kid 
 But not on me 
 Rain rain won't go away 
 Cloud on my head every single day 
 These games games that you play 
 Eventually I'll get up and say 
 No no not this time 
 I'm taking back what is mine 
 With this faith 
 We will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair 
 A stone of hope 
 With this faith 
 We will be able to transform our nation 
 Into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood 
 With this faith 
 We will be able to stand up for freedom together 
 Knowing that we will be free one day 
 This will be the day 
 When all children will be able to sing with new meaning 
 -The Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. 
 Stand up 
 Take what's mine 
 Insecurities 
 Is what your trying to hide 
 I don't care 
 For the things that you say 
 I know that you are just one step away 
 From breaking down 
 Pick yourself up off the ground 
 I know that you are better than this 
 Open your eyes 
 Now is the time 
 To rise up 
 With darkness will still shine 
 Idolize and deposed wrong or right 
 Will make it through to the other side
