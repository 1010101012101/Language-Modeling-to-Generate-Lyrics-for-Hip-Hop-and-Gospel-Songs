With the spread of the virus at the end of six weeks... 
 We go now to breaking news... 
 Nobody's doing anything about it... 
 ...28 suicides... 
 They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate 
 Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name 
 In a world that's insane, was America to blame? 
 When you're prayin' for a change to a god with no face 
 They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate 
 Like a fuckin' AK, it's goin' up in flames 
 In a world that's insane, was America to blame? 
 When you're prayin' for a change to a god with no face 
 You can't tell me what to say, because I've got one religion 
 And I've got one decision, it's a big "fuck you!" 
 I keep spittin' in your face every month and every day 
 Every time you hear my name, my middle finger's up too 
 You think I own you, but I ain't got no room 
 For these hoes 'cause they're no good, I ain't livin' by your rules 
 You're gettin' older, full of liquor, you're bloated 
 And you want to be noticed, but you're dyin' so slowly 
 So when they point the finger 
 You flip one back and say, "Fuck that, fuck that!" 
 So when they point the finger 
 We'll flip ours back and say, "Fuck that, fuck that!" 
 They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate 
 Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name 
 In a world that's insane, was America to blame? 
 When you're prayin' for a change to a god with no face 
 They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate 
 Like a fuckin' AK, it's goin' up in flames 
 In a world that's insane, was America to blame? 
 When you're prayin' for a change to a god with no face 
 Eenie-meenie-minie-mo, each one of you's gonna know 
 When your time is comin' soon 'cause there ain't enough room 
 In this world for us two, yeah, I hate to break the news 
 But I'll break it in this music to let world know who 
 Who you've been usin', who you're abusin' 
 It's the suits you've been foolin', but you know that you're useless 
 So he's actin' so ruthless deep inside you're just ruined 
 'Cause I just keep on movin' here to show you the truth, bitch 
 So when they point the finger 
 You flip one back and say "Fuck that, fuck that!" 
 So when they point the finger 
 We'll flip ours back and say "Fuck that, fuck that!" 
 They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate 
 Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name 
 In a world that's insane, was America to blame? 
 When you're prayin' for a change to a god with no face 
 They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate 
 Like a fuckin' AK, it's goin' up in flames 
 In a world that's insane, was America to blame? 
 When you're prayin' for a change to a god with no face 
 Why can't you die? (Why can't you die) 
 Motherfucker, just die! (Motherfucker, just die) 
 No more goodbyes! (No more goodbyes) 
 Just fuckin' die! (Just fuckin' die) 
 They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate 
 Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name 
 In a world that's insane, was America to blame? 
 When you're prayin' for a change to a god with no face 
 They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate 
 Like a needle in your veins, a sickness with no name 
 So when they point the finger 
 You flip one back and say "Fuck that, fuck that!" 
 They wanna see blood, they wanna see hate 
 Like a fuckin' AK, it's goin' up in flames (Flames) 
 So when they point the finger 
 We flip ours back and say "Fuck that, fuck that!"
