 Gadjet 
 Yo, Hollywood Who? Without my dawg Deuce, 
 Don't make me have to ride, Men the boy got juice 
 In or outside, this ain't only in the booth 
 Somebody gonna die, they gonna wish they called truce 
 Kinda Major on a track got Truth, Gadjet get the facts 
 If you faggots wants prove, might as well hang it up now 
 No noose, 
 I'm fuckin' everybody, leave your pussies out loose 
 Tie em' up and I throw em' in the trunk 
 Fuckers want a war 
 And imma give em' what they want 
 Bend they ass over 
 Imma treat them like a punk 
 Prison break that ass off. 
 Going till I bust a nut 
 I don't give a fuck, never have never will 
 Go try find a better rapper with some better skill 
 I murder mother fuckers, I massacre for the thrill 
 Itching for some fucking killing and blood is my Benadryl

 Look now, you got to admit 
 No one likes your pussy music 
 You say you sold out, but didn't sell shit 
 Fucking idiots, lip sync fags milli vanili bitch 
 How the fuck do you call yourselves a band? 
 You can barely rap its on now 
 What comes up must come must come down 
 When this shit flies, I won't be around 
 Saying I can't spit was your biggest mistake 
 Now UNDEAD sucks, they're a bunch of fakes 
 Johnnys' getting overweight he's to fat to be callin' names 
 Let's play a game 
 Everyone's listening 
 When I say fuck, sing along and say "Fuck HU" 
 Fuck HU! 
 When I say "What's my name?" 
 You call me Big Deuce 
 What's my name?

 So don't you try, we packin' 9's, we leave you dead in ditches 
 Truth 
 It's what it is, I'm the best in the Biz 
 Black ski masks and the sig, 2 clips 
 2 sips off of that Rosay 
 With my man Jose with the coke 
 Wait

 HU be softer then the sea breeze 
 Fuck You 
 We be nuttier than a resees 
 And we see more dough 
 Move more blow 
 Deuce go solo, drop y'all homos 
 So fly come out the parachute 
 I'm always first to bail 
 Never scared to shoot 
 The Truth, ya know I'm out for the loot 
 Heading to the top 
 We movin' through the roof 
 Shorty got her top down 
 Just like the coupe 
 Fuck you, this is 9 Lives 
 Real like, my ties 
 One slip and you all die 
 Deuce 
 That's when we ride on bitches, you fuckin' faggot snitches 
 So don't you try, we packin' 9's, we leave you dead in ditches 
 Hat's when we ride on bitches, you fuckin' faggot snitches

 Six shooters up!

 Point them up! 
 Nacho 
 Imma snatch your mask off 
 And tell it like it is 
 No more talent, no more show biz 
 Deuce left the band 
 Now y'all a bunch of jokes 
 Hollywood IS Dead 
 And thatz all she fucken wrote 
 Leave you dead in the ditches 
 Heard you were snitches 
 9Lives that's how 
 We ride on you bitches, yeah 
 I said it, it's the boy from GML 
 If you got hurt feeling, oh well 
 Do something you couldn't 
 Face me on your best day 
 The Wiz Kid is gone 
 That's why you get less pay 
 Still remember when your 
 First album dropped 
 Skipped it to the chorus 
 The rest of y'all flopped 
 Wack ass lyrics 
 I mean garbage 
 Leaky like a faucet 
 Your whole entourage 
 Wish on a star bitch 
 You'll never make a million 
 Ninelives and GML 
 In the buildin' 
 Deuce
