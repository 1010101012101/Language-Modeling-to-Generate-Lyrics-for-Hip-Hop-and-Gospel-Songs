Nobody likes me 
 No one likes me 
 But I don't like them 
 Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh 
 Nobody likes me 
 No one likes me 
 Why? 'Cause I don't like them 
 Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh 
 All this hate you gave me, it turned me to rage 
 Now I'm burning in flames, all the things you've said 
 They've been stuck in my head and now I'm at it again, an addict 
 Welcome to hell, bitch, you can't do nothing about it 
 Out of my way, faggot 
 You heard what I said, damnit 
 I am an automatic 
 Ready to fire back at 
 All of you fuckers laughing 
 Not gonna lie, I've had it 
 I'm gonna wreak havoc 
 Everyone's dying, don't matter 
 This is my chance, maybe my last 
 And if I leave, there's no way back 
 This is your fate when worlds collapse 
 I took my pain, now I give it back 
 I give it back, give it back 
 Only one of us will laugh last 
 (Now I give it back) 
 I give it back, give it back 
 Break this whole fucking world in half 
 Nobody likes me 
 No one likes me 
 But I don't like them 
 Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh 
 Nobody likes me 
 No one likes me 
 Why? 'Cause I don't like them 
 Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh 
 I used to have so many friends I thought I could trust 
 But when it came to saving me, you let me self-destruct 
 Well I'm back now, I'm seeking out this vengeance 
 Not to mention that this black cloud, it sticks around and visits my intuition 
 Won't let me back down and I swear to God my heart is like a piston 
 Pumping rage into this engine, turn the keys to my ignition, listen 
 Nobody likes me, it's enlightening, it excites me 
 That I talk this shit with the lyrics I spit and still nobody will fight me 
 Try walking a mile in my shoes and get beat with your own Nikes 
 I'm a grimy motherfucker with the mic, so call me Mikey 
 I got no patience lately for these fucking faggots faking, making 
 Lies up, wise up if you really think you can take me 
 Wake me up from this lazy battle 
 I'll rattle you with my crazy paddle 
 Pay my dues back on the saddle 
 The lonely road that I slowly travel 
 This is my chance, maybe my last 
 And if I leave, there's no way back 
 This is your fate when worlds collapse 
 I took my pain, now I give it back 
 Nobody likes me 
 No one likes me 
 But I don't like them 
 Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh 
 Nobody likes me 
 No one likes me 
 Why? 'Cause I don't like them 
 Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh 
 You thought you figured it out 
 You thought you... 
 Figured me out! You never figured me out! 
 You cannot figure me out! 
 Shut the fuck up, I'll burn you fuckers down! 
 I know you're proud, I held my ground 
 Time's running out 
 You hear the crowd, they know you're down 
 Time's running out 
 Nobody likes me 
 No one likes me 
 But I don't like them 
 Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh 
 Nobody likes me 
 No one likes me 
 Why? 'Cause I don't like them 
 Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh 
 Now it's much too late to say 
 You're sorry, I don't care what you think 
 (Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh) 
 Now it's too much to late to say 
 You're sorry, I don't care what you think 
 Uh-uh, I don't, nah-uh
