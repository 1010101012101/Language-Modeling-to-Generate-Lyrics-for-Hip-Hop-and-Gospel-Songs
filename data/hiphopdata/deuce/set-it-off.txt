(Deuce) 
 They know, I came to set it off. 
 God let me know I can let it off. 
 You see my cross yeah' it never falls. 
 You know it's on till the break of dawn. 
 (Truth speaking) 
 (Deuce) 
 We ride, we roll and everybody here knows 
 That I kill these flo's they keep say'n no-no. 
 They know me fo' real and that's fo' sho', 
 When I grab the wheel, 
 Truth's got the dough.
