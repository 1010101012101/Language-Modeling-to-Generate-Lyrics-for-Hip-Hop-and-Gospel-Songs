Deuce: 
 Got some screws loose in me, 
 We gon' ride all night long, 
 You don't want it with me, 
 Thruth's got my back, I got nine lives. 
 Truth: 
 Hey yo man, 
 It's goin' crazy in the hood man, 
 We tryin' to eat man, yeah, 
 Buckle up your seat bells, 
 Let me take you on a ride, 
 She got the new benz, 
 All thanks to the white, 
 Man, I walk the walk, 
 Y'all talk the talk, 
 This is too easy, 
 It's like a walk in the park, 
 At 17, I watched grams turn into halves, 
 Clockwork in the hood all turn into cash, 
 Easy come, easy go, so it all went fast, 
 Cruisin, all rustlin, I slowed up the whip, 
 Sick style, four five symbol on my head, 
 I got hollyhood all under control, 
 I got a few strippers comin' down the pole, 
 I know a few killers into every corner store, 
 And when it's time to work, I put in work, 
 I don't phone up the next man to handle my dirt, 
 I'ma keep it straight, man, love me or hate me, 
 Posted in my neck of the woods, the good old safety. 
 Deuce: 
 I got blood on my hands, 
 And these streets keep gettin' colder, 
 But I won't stop for nothing, no, 
 Fourty four, man, tuck them gone, 
 There's blood on my hands, 
 And these streets keep gettin' colder, 
 But this time it's me and Truth we gettin' down, 
 'Cause in the land of the dead I wear the crown. 
 Truth: 
 Always put away, I came back like karma, 
 The streets, it's crazy, hot like sauna, 
 A whole to nine to five, fuck slow money, 
 I hustle my hustle, sweeter than honey, 
 My flow's is dynamite, I'm bound to blow, 
 I'm livin' the fast life, ridin' slow, 
 Crisis adverted, damn rotation, 
 The streets is quiet, you can feel the tension, 
 I hustle the hustler, I keep 'em procked, 
 All eyes on me like the red carpet, 
 Got guns meet you off of sinco, you should, 
 What happens in hollyhood stays in hollyhood, 
 We do it like them italians back in the days, 
 Start sprayin' shit up with tommy's and ak's 
 I am the general, what I say goes, 
 Even though I'm the boss, still stay on my toes. 
 Deuce: 
 I can see blood on my hands, 
 And these streets keep gettin' colder, 
 But I won't stop for nothing, no, 
 Fourty four, man, tuck them gone, 
 There's blood on my hands, 
 And these streets keep gettin' colder, 
 But this time it's me and Truth we gettin' down, 
 'Cause in the land of the dead I wear the crown. 
 Truth: 
 Art of war gave me a whole lot of wisdom, 
 48 laws of power told me how to finish him, 
 I'ma gas up my tank, got plenty of fuel, 
 I'm gettin' more attention than the new kid at school, 
 Big sammy told me once: "Never look back", 
 I've been killin' the game ever since that, 
 No father to guide me, had to grow up quick, 
 It's me against the world as I'm holding my dick, 
 I'm climbin' up the ladder, ain't no stoppin' me, 
 I got the blue prints, 
 I'm playin' monopoly, 
 Used to sit in my cell, 
 Open up the bible, tryin' to kill myself, 
 Feelin' suicidal, 
 I'm a man, I'ma hold my ground, 
 I promissed my dad I won't let my mom down, 
 We all make mistakes, 
 Don't y'all understand? 
 I am the Truth, I am who I am.
