Sometimes I feel like I wanted this to end 
 Sometimes I feel like there's nothing left 
 Sometimes I feel like the world was falling down 
 Somehow I feel like I was wrong 
 Don't go Don't stay 
 Don't fight the feeling that you felt so long before 
 Don't tell me everything is all right 
 Don't go Don't stay 
 Don't find the reason why we fallin' down today 
 Don't tell me everything is all right 
 Don't go 
 Sometimes I feel like I'm falling in this mess 
 Somehow I still feel so upset 
 Sometimes I feel like the world was gonna end 
 Somehow I feel like I was wrong 
 Don't go Don't stay 
 Don't fight the feeling that you felt so long before 
 Don't tell me everything is all right 
 Don't go Don't stay 
 Don't find the reason why we fallin' down today 
 Don't tell me everything is all right 
 Don't go 
 Will you stay with this life I betrayed 
 Will you pray with me, I'm falling apart 
 Will you stay with this life I betrayed 
 Will you pray with me, I'm falling apart 
 Don't go Don't stay 
 Don't fight the feeling that you felt so long before 
 Don't tell me everything is all right 
 Don't go Don't stay 
 Don't find the reason why we fallin' down today 
 Don't tell me everything is all right 
 Don't go 
 Don't tell me 
 Don't go 
 Feel like I wanted this to end
