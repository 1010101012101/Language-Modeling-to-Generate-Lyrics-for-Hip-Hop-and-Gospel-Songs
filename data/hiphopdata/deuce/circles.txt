Take my hand, lets go 
 Somewhere we can rest our souls 
 We'll sit where it's warm 
 You'll say 'Look, we're here alone' 
 I was runnin' in circles, I hurt myself 
 Just to find my purpose 
 Everything was so worthless, I didn't deserve this, 
 But to me, you were perfect 
 I'm scattered through this life, 
 If this is life, I'll say goodbye 
 She's gone like an angel, 
 With wings, let me burn tonight! 
 Now watch my wounds, they turn to dust 
 Watch me heal, so I can love 
 I need to breathe so I can touch 
 Touch the waters in the ocean 
 When I breathe, it's like a rush 
 I can finally feel the trust 
 I can finally lead my lust 
 It's like I bleed, but I don't bust 
 So hold my hand, see the sky, see the waters, see the sun 
 If it's cold, I'll keep you warm 
 There's no need, then go back home 
 It's just me, it's just you, now we're free 
 We're all alone 
 Every problem has it's hope 
 And I promise I can fix them on my own 
 I've gone away, seen better times than yesterday 
 It's hard to say, that everything will be okay 
 I've gone away, seen better times than yesterday 
 It's hard to say, that everything will be okay
