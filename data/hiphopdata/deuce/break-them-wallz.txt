9 Lives 
 Jeffree Star 
 Deuce: 
 I've been stuck inside my head too long 
 It's time to get out and Break Them Wallz 
 I can almost hear them angels call 
 If gods on my side I won't fall 
 Jeffree Star: 
 It's Jeffree Bitch I'm hidin' razor blades in my clit 
 I used to have a big dick now I'm tighter than shit 
 I just sucked your dad off, that's how I paid for these tits 
 Suffocated him quick, so I could play with his kids 
 Teddy bears and pig tails 
 Blow pops and blood trails 
 The tranny's in your house 
 Chainsaw, pink nails 
 Hot pants and high heals 
 The Dallmer she-male 
 With deuce and truth it's fuckin' unreal 
 We keep the body parts for our next meal 
 SÃ­ senorita we go rape you in the rear 
 Now my makeup's gettin' smeared 
 Ooh, my hands are on the mirror 
 I fucked the whole warped tour 
 Turning all them bitches queer 
 Deuce: 
 I've been stuck inside my head too long 
 It's time to get out and Break Them Wallz 
 I can almost hear them angels call 
 If gods on my side I won't fall 
 Deuce: 
 It's fuckin' crazy how easy it is 
 For me to just make all them hits 
 It don't even take any wit 
 And that's why I'm dangerous 
 Don't think that we ain't got 
 Them guns on our hips 
 My guns are stronger than his 
 Shit's like a bomb when it hits 
 I'm the new Obama it's sick 
 The way I rhyme every syllable 
 My pencils my witness 
 So yeah I'm the incredible 
 Deuce you know it's inevitable, 
 Shits about to get federal 
 Blow the white house and president up 
 It shows how much I give a fuck 
 You know I got more than enough 
 Skills when your daughters are rockin' vibrators 
 Cock up in they vaginas 
 And think that I'm up inside them 
 But really I'm just here writin' 
 With Jeffree and Truth beside us 
 99 percent of the time I got my mind set 
 On them millions of dollars 
 And with that comes some violence 
 Ever since me and Jimmy I met 
 I've been climbin', fuck whilin' 
 That's how you know he signed me 
 Deuce: 
 I've been stuck inside my head too long 
 It's time to get out and Break Them Wallz 
 I can almost hear them angels call 
 If gods on my side I won't fall 
 Truth: 
 It's dramma after dramma 
 I pop to kill 
 Mother fuckers know that I keep it real 
 I'm not a patient but I'm mad ill 
 Don't play me son you might get killed 
 Same city same whip 
 I'm back in the same bitch 
 Not 50 not EM 
 We droppin' the same hits 
 Damn kid you know I'm on it like Hendrix 
 I damage everybody that's average 
 They talk about me all the time 
 But I don't really give a fuck 
 Under pressure all the time 
 I'm in the hood pistol tucked 
 I'm the Truth I state the facts 
 Fuck a snitch I murder rats 
 My state of mind is hustle grind 
 Make some moves and watch me shine 
 Pistol layin' on my lap 
 Angels got my fuckin' back 
 This is hell bitch 
 All red like velvet 
 9 Lives kid, 
 Lemme see you rep this 
 Deuce: 
 I've been stuck inside my head too long 
 It's time to get out and Break Them Wallz 
 I can almost hear them angels call 
 If gods on my side I won't fall
