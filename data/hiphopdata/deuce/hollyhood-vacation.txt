(Deuce) 
 Yeah, 9 lives 
 (Truth) 
 California, Hollyhood got the liquor feelin' good 
 Cali bud light it up 
 Get your money that's what's up 
 Ya that's me from the streets in the car with my heat 
 What you need? 
 V-I who, V-I what, you with me 
 (Deuce Chorus: x2) 
 Shsh shake it to the front shsh shake it to the back 
 Now turn it all around show me how you shake that ass 
 I'm in the club gettin' buzzed, ya I'm faded 
 And baby momma if you want it we can make it 
 (Truth) 
 Just close your eyes completely shut 
 Open your eyes and face The Truth 
 Marinate facts observe the scene 
 GML respect the roots 
 Money, money I get it, get it 
 Hustle hard no lookin' back 
 Shake them haters that's for real 
 Make some moves and watch me stack 
 I'm hood baby can't you tell 
 Hollywood fuck Glendale 
 Oh well I went to jail 
 Guess what, Deuce got bail 
 9 lives off my chain 
 I'm cool cool, so insane 
 Mona Lisa, perfect picture 
 Got beef my pistol get you 
 Chuck Taylors, white T's, low riders, man please 
 Back up off me you fuckin' chump 
 Turn this up and let it bump 
 Ruthless cats on my team 
 Nightmare, I'm in your dream 
 You're the crop I'm the cream 
 I'm the hustler you're the fiend 
 Back it up, shake that ass 
 Me and Deuce no need to ask 
 He gone crazy lost his mask 
 I gone crazy and got his back 
 Lights on, lights off 
 It's about to spark off 
 Flow is so heavy it'll knock your socks off 
 (Deuce Chorus: x2) 
 Shsh shake it to the front shsh shake it to the back 
 Now turn it all around show me how you shake that ass 
 I'm in the club gettin' buzzed, ya I'm faded 
 And baby momma if you want it we can make it 
 (Deuce) 
 This shit's so easy 
 You see me, you can't believe that it's me 
 Oh my God, he's in all my dreams 
 Oh my God, you know how to sing 
 Oh my God, it's you is this real? 
 Ya you see me sittin' and drinkin' 
 You see me sittin', I'm thinkin' she thinks I'm easy 
 Believe me when she comes home there's no teasin' 
 And there's no speakin', ya feel me? 
 She wants to fuck with no rubber and she go think I'ma love her 
 Bitch better stay in the covers 'cause we ain't gotta be lovers 
 Just take your pants off and cuddle 
 Don't call your man 'cause it's trouble, 
 If he comes back I'ma shovel a hole so deep in my yard 
 I'll let him sleep with the sharks, fishes 
 So don't be alarmed when I take the keys to your car 
 Wa we ain't gotta be buddies or hug inside of no club 
 We ain't gotta make nothin' public, so fuck it 
 'Cause next week I'll be havin' models and bottles inside my one room apartment 
 That's when this shit gets retarded 
 And bitches start seein' doubles of me and wake up in trouble with me 
 'She's only 17 man!' 
 That's when they call the police 
 (Deuce Chorus: x2) 
 Shsh shake it to the front shsh shake it to the back 
 Now turn it all around show me how you shake that ass 
 I'm in the club gettin' buzzed, ya I'm faded 
 And baby momma if you want it we can make it 
 (Truth) 
 Ooh, I'm back, The Truth, that's that 
 I'ma star like Terry O, short bus retarded flow 
 Want the money plus the fame, run rap mando 
 I'm fast, faster than a honey mustard lambo movin' through an open road 
 Worldwide, around the globe 
 What's the streets without the code? 
 Escobar without the blow 
 Jiberjaber yip yap 
 Competition where you at? 
 All you suckers I don't slack 
 Got a problem, do the math 
 (Deuce Chorus) 
 Shsh shake it to the front shsh shake it to the back 
 Now turn it all around show me how you shake that ass 
 I'm in the club gettin' buzzed, ya I'm faded 
 And baby momma if you want it we can make it
