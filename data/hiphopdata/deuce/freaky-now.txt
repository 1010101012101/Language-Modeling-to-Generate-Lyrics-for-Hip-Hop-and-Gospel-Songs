 In the back sittin', VIP 
 That's right! 
 And you still waiting outside with a girl 
 Mad 'cause I got through the front line 
 With a gun, Yeah! It's all fun 
 Till you're laid out 
 With your brains out 
 And you end up on the other side of the club 
 With your face down 
 While the whole club 
 Bangs out of control 
 Its out of this world! 
 The way you shake them hips 
 Makes me like "Damn Girl" 
 The way them lips taste 
 Makes me think "Damn, sure that you're suckin dicks, straight from the mens bathroom" 
 A lil drip drip, cause you stuck your dick quick 
 Inside some bitch and made me realize "Oh Shiit" 
 Took that shit out when it smelled like cold fish 
 A lil Chlamydia ain't gonna do shit!

 Truth:

 Bentleys and palm trees 
 You can tell this armenian 
 Looking at his car keys. 
 Got a problem, Add it up 
 Damn right, I'm tatted up. 
 California, Stand up 
 And, go on, put your hands up. 
 I'm sipping on whatever 
 So she can look better. 
 I don't want no problems 
 So I brought the condoms. 
 Truth is in the house 
 She must be in some luck. 
 I seen her at the club 
 And heard she want's to fuck. 
 I'm gangster like white walls 
 Sitting on a regal 
 I hear no, and I see no, and I speak no evil. 
 Rock your boat, baby, I'm the coolest skipper. 
 Live up in this hospital, Ain't nobody sicker. 
 Balling, baby, My jewels speak for themselves. 
 I got the LVs on the bag 
 Just match the belt. 
 I like the smiles on your bitch and that's a fact 
 I get some miles on your bitch and I send her ass back 
 That's right.

 I hope she ain't think we dating 
 Truth: 
 I'm heroin I'm like ecstasy 
 All these girls want sex from me 
 Blowin' up my phone 
 Always texting me 
 All they wanna do is get next to me 
 I'm schizo, I'm loco. 
 They're mad because I'm rolling solo. 
 I'm rich trying to get that modo. 
 And in the bed these girls say I'm a mofo.
