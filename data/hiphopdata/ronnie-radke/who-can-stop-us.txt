 Who can stop us now? 
 While the whole world bows 
 Watch us share this crown 
 Every time you step in, we push you out 
 Who can stop us now? 
 While the whole world bows 
 Try and bring us down 
 Every time we step in, we push you out 
 Ronnie 
 I rock hard (No sleep) 
 Marriage (Not me) 
 My shoe game is so cold, see 
 Two reasons I got cold feet 
 And friendship is important 
 My gear is all imported 
 Deuce is on my course 
 Me and B. Lay gonna get that Forbes List 
 And I'm gonna straight roll to each state, though 
 Gonna make a fuckin' killing on a bank roll 
 And can't ya see that I will compete 
 With any other rapper in the game, bro? 
 And I got this, 'cause I'm a locksmith 
 Got the game on lock 
 In a hot minute, and Ima lose my cool 
 When I step up in the pool 
 'Bout to lose a tooth, 'cause I'm flossin' 
 No oxygen bitch, I'm a glitch away 
 When I flip this, motherfucker, I got shit to say 
 Be cautious, bitch, I'm a twitch away 
 From steppin' on another fuckin' bitch today 
 'Cause I'ma pinch the weight 
 And I'ma get the cake 
 If anybody got a problem, I could demonstrate 
 To definition of a sauna, hotter than the summer 
 Park it undercover 
 I'ma beat the case of record 
 Trailer gonna, gonna, gonna like I gotta, put my foot up on the pedal to the metal, motherfucker 
 I'm a runner, and you wonder how I came up from the get up 
 With a scalpel and a son of fuck 
 I swear I'm a part of y'all on another level 
 I got turn up, gonna kill 'em with the thunder, motherfuckers gettin' dumber 
 Fuck you plumbers, stackin' shit up like a pawn shop 
 Everybody's got a problem, check it bubber 
 Anybody wanna solve it? 
 Get my number, fuck you harder 
 I'ma gut you like a motherfuckin' glock

 B.Lay 
 Born to win, most my niggas were born to sin, I'm born again 
 Rock with the pistol, all Christian 
 I'll cross you out for steppin' in with my crew 
 What it do? 
 'Sup, dude? 
 Wit crew eyes 
 And new 2Pac in the boondocks 
 I'm never givin' in to your rude thoughts 
 And I'm bangin' like a motherfuckin' boombox 
 Since age of two 
 Lookin' outside, seein' red and blue 
 With a sue, woo-hoo 
 And a goo-goo twos 
 And my coo-coo moon, so who are you to question? 
 Never hung 'round niggas that gang bang 
 Let their pants hang, do their damn thang 
 Let the pistol bang, and the booty sang 
 Gets past the jail with the booty train 
 So who's gonna stop me now? 
 Huh? 
 I rose from the ghetto to a different level 
 The motherfuckin' Devil won a hell of a hell hold 
 If Hell froze (Hell nah) 
 Come walk in my shoes, see a different view 
 Want with your shoes 
 To be another motherfuckin' stat in the news 
 I planned it, boo 
 And you wonder why all my niggas like fancy jewels, baggy pants, and flashy shoes? 
 Been bobbin' the source and passin' dudes 
 I'm a fashion dude 
 I'm dat nigga, doe 
 And my new back, and my new swag 
 And my new snap in that game 
 Yeah, I'm dat new nigga, dat rain
