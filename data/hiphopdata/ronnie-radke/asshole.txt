Ronnie 
 I got an insane posse we ain't clowns though 
 I ain't a juggalo, but I always fucking juggle hoes 
 And maybe it's in my nature but I never wanna date her 
 But she's like a shot of vodka 'cause I always gotta chase her 
 What's the fucking problem with the one night stand? 
 I'm never gonna settle down you need to understand 
 And let me keep it simple I'm officially stable 
 And I won't miss you here's a tissue 
 I got issues believe me 
 And I always see my mommy in every woman I meet 
 But I hate my fucking mother motherfucker it's weak 
 So please believe me I'm a needy insecure fucking freak 
 And it ain't as easy or as dreamy you thought it would be 
 Took her out dinner (Yeah), went and tried to kiss her (Okay) 
 Open up my eyes the fucking bitch was checking twitter (What?) 
 Ladies, I ain't trying to be rude, but I'll never date a bitch who Instagrams her fucking food 
 Andy 
 Oh, I lost my fucking mind 
 It happens all the time 
 'Cause I can't stand myself 
 I'm an asshole baby 
 Oh, I'm fashionably late 
 I'm the one you love to hate 
 'Cause I can't stand myself 
 'Cause I'm an asshole baby

 Check up in the scene in mid-2006 
 I was automatically labeled as a God damn prick 
 I go to prison and get out and I'm back at it (Hi guys) 
 I ain't afraid to go back better watch that lip 
 But the music nowadays always sound the same 
 But it's pretty fucking lame with you fucking lames claim 
 To be real music and you got to feel stupid 
 To be still choosing to abuse the privilege and you still use it 
 Lately all you bands do the same damn shit 
 Same break down snare kicking lame ass riff 
 And everybody still fucking the same lame damn bitch 
 That comes to every show, showing her fake ass tits 
 But not me, I'm on a whole other planet 
 And I'll be damned if I sit back and let this fucking shit happen 
 I'm an assassin, with that music and fashion 
 When I cash out no backtracks I stack racks I cashed in 
 Andy 
 Oh, I lost my fucking mind 
 It happens all the time

 'Cause I'm an asshole baby

 ( 
 Andy: 
 Alright) 
 You all are going to fucking die 
 Fuck you, fuck your tweets, fuck everything about you 
 Social media my fucking ass 
 Hahahaha! 
 I'm an asshole baby 
 Last but not least I want to thank my fans 
 The best damn fanbase a band could have 
 And to show appreciation for how grateful I am 
 Here's a mic stand (Sure up), take it home to your dad 
 I got arrested for a crime that I didn't commit 
 And I never beat my girlfriend, she's a God damn bitch man 
 The truth is that she was pissed, I broke it off 
 So what she did was calculate a plan to hurt me any chance she could get (Damn) 
 Fuck it, her plot didn't work the jig is up and everybody knows this berserk 
 All you tough guys, and wise guys, gangsters on that Wi-Fi 
 Your bitch in real life and in real life I will fight 
 Just because I rock theme skinny jeans and a belt don't mean shit motherfucker 
 I'll knock your ass out for real 
 'Cause I'm pissed off, I'll piss on anybody 
 'Cause I spit raw, I split jaws I'm hip hop 
 I'll Nicholas cage your face off 
 Andy
