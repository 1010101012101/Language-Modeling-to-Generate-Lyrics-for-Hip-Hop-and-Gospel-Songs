He treat me right, he did me wrong 
 He made me weak, he made me strong 
 He pissed me off, he turned me on 
 He made me realize I'm betta off alone 
 (Nowwhat he do) He made me laugh, he made me cry 
 He kept it real, then he would he lie 
 He made me cum, he made me fight 
 He made me realize he just wasn't right 
 I know relationships got they ups and downs 
 Or it can seem like circles going round and round 
 It ain't gon be perfect 
 Although that's what I want 
 He was the best candidate and he gettin' my vote 
 Started off good doing everything right 
 Checkin' in like you should coming home at night 
 Smile in my face and keep me fly 
 Make me feel proud that he my guy 
 Ok now why you gotta change, you gotta lie 
 Learning to play with my mind 
 I can't believe I waste my time 
 He treat me right, he did me wrong 
 He made me weak, he made me strong 
 He pissed me off, he turned me on 
 He made me realize I'm betta off alone 
 (Nowwhat he do) He made me laugh, he made me cry 
 He kept it real, then he would he lie 
 He made me cum, he made me fight 
 He made me realize he just wasn't right 
 Damn how could I be so naive 
 I let my guard down and there he went sellin me dreams 
 And it's a shame, I thought I had someone on my team 
 But he was slowly tryna break down my self-esteem 
 Tryna control me and everywhere I went 
 From the clothes I wore to the friends I kept 
 Kept tracking my every step, thinkin' I'm creepin' with someone else 
 Man I played myself, I betrayed myself 
 I had to let him go 'cause disrespect is what I felt 
 He treat me right, he did me wrong 
 He made me weak, he made me strong 
 He pissed me off, he turned me on 
 He made me realize I'm betta off alone 
 (Nowwhat he do) He made me laugh, he made me cry 
 He kept it real, then he would he lie 
 He made me cum, he made me fight 
 He made me realize he just wasn't right 
 Sleepin' with the enemy is what I did 
 He made all the right moves just to reel me in 
 I should of stuck with my friends or listened to kins 
 And Id of never got caught up in this situation 
 But I'm ok, I'm standin on my own two 
 I'm independent and I'm strong and I'm so over you 
 I thank God everyday for pullin me through 
 'Cause everything you did to me I already done to you 
 He treat me right, he did me wrong 
 He made me weak, he made me strong 
 He pissed me off, he turned me on 
 He made me realize I'm betta off alone 
 (Nowwhat he do) He made me laugh, he made me cry 
 He kept it real, then he would he lie 
 He made me cum, he made me fight 
 He made me realize he just wasn't right
