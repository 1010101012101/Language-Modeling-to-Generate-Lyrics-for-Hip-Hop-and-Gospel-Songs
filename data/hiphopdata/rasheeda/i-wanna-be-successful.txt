Everyday I get greater that means everyday I get another damn hater 
 Tryna count my money you gone need a calculator 
 'Cause I'm putting up numbers like iplay for the lakers 
 I'm tryna get it right alone with the glory 
 Mutha f.ckas don't know me but they swear they know my story 
 But ima get it to you straight from the horses mouth 
 I'm that chick out the south everybody talking bout 
 Tryna fill my mind with doubt but I got a kid 
 First album dropped in 01 not I'm on my 5th 
 My first single was a classic then you tried to tell me idont make f.cking magic 
 When they think I'm done, here icome again 
 Hungry like the first day iput the pad to the pen 
 I mean the pen to the pad, sacrifice so much to get everything I have 
 And iwant so much more the # 1 spot grammy seats in the front row 
 I built lanes others wanna drive in 
 Comparing me to them is like a nurse to a surgeon 
 Next big take, I go in 
 I been a 10, birth may 25th I was born to win 
 I'm better than, I'm better than 
 When will this bullshit cease, when will these dumb rappers realixze they on my leesh 
 When will they realize they career has been leeshed 
 They playing all your music when you're dead 
 Leaving nothing for your seed that be the difference between you and me 
 I'm never caught up in this superficial rap shit 
 I'm standing on my platform spitting from my pool pit 
 And I won't quit, 
 I want the glamour, shine like a star 
 Pussy cat drownn, oh isuppose 
 I just wanna be 
 I just wanna be successful 
 I just wanna be 
 I just wanna be successful 
 Terrestrial bitch 
 The mixtape is crazy 
 Rasheeda baby!
