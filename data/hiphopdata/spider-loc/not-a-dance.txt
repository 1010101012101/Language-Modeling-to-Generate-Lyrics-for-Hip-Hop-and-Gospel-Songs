(Feat. Young Buck and C-Bo) 
 Young Buck: 
 I see all of these niggas with these rags in they pockets, 
 How many of 'em really bang 
 And where the fuck is you from and what the fuck do you claim 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 You are not a gangsta you ain't from the hood 
 You twistin' up your fingers but you ain't ever stood 
 On this block where we put in work homie do your thang 
 This shit is not a game 
 Better watch what you claim 
 When they Crip Walk it ain't a dance 
 And when they Blood Walk it ain't a dance 
 When they Crip Walk it ain't a dance 
 And when they Blood Walk it ain't a dance 
 (Verse 1: Spider Loc) 
 Gang bangers! 
 Cuzz you can get mopped up for walkin' like that 
 You ain't from nowhere so stop talkin' like that 
 You best pull your pants up and lose that rag 
 Or you 'gon make the Loc loc up and use that Mag 
 I'm shooter I keep fresh prints on the Glock 
 And you's a goofball the real fresh prince on the block 
 Pop imposters quick serve these bustas slugs 
 You ain't a Crip or a Blood naw just a thug 
 Niggas start Harlem Shakin' and get carried away 
 But bust a wrong move and you can get buried today 
 I stay in these streets gangbangin' with a black Mac 
 What happened to the baggy jeans and ya back pack? 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 You are not a gangsta you ain't from the hood 
 You twistin' up your fingers but you ain't ever stood 
 On this block where we put in work homie do your thang 
 This shit is not a game 
 Better watch what you claim 
 When they Crip Walk it ain't a dance 
 And when they Blood Walk it ain't a dance 
 When they Crip Walk it ain't a dance 
 And when they Blood Walk it ain't a dance 
 (Verse 2: Young Buck) 
 If you ask me bangin' started on the West Coast 
 Way 'for a nigga ever heard of Death Row 
 I was out there me and my big cousin E 
 These Califonia streets ain't like Tennessee 
 But the hood ain't no different it's the same old shit 
 Don't nobody talk when a nigga get hit 
 Fell in love with this life, started takin' them trips 
 I got a few Blood homies but I hang with Crips 
 Put in my work I'm stickin' to the g-code 
 I got my ass in that car and let that heat go 
 Let you tell it you a motherfuckin' OG 
 But they don't know you and niggas know me 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 You are not a gangsta you ain't from the hood 
 You twistin' up your fingers but you ain't ever stood 
 On this block where we put in work homie do your thang 
 This shit is not a game 
 Better watch what you claim 
 When they Crip Walk it ain't a dance 
 And when they Blood Walk it ain't a dance 
 When they Crip Walk it ain't a dance 
 And when they Blood Walk it ain't a dance 
 (Verse 3: C-Bo) 
 I hustle on the block 
 Work my muscle with the pot 
 Touch the cash fast 
 Like 0 to 60 on the dash 
 My .38 Mag out the stash 
 As I roll past 
 Cause the Gucci bag got more cash you're ever gonna have 
 See I'm a gang banger 
 Neighborhood caine slanger 
 If I'm not a gang banger got caine caine slanger 
 I don't C-Walk to dance 
 Probablly if I chalked a man 
 I just hit a Ca$hville trap and made a hundred grand 
 I just made a nigga flat 
 That was the size of Shaq 
 I'll bat 
 On that half-a-stick sprayin' my Mac 
 Like when the homies attackin' 
 Then kills a top head 
 I might C-Walk in the club and spend top bread 
 Like yeah the block bled 
 Niggas ain't said a word 
 Now I sit in the perfect position for me to set a verb 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 You are not a gangsta you ain't from the hood 
 You twistin' up your fingers but you ain't ever stood 
 On this block where we put in work homie do your thang 
 This shit is not a game 
 Better watch what you claim 
 When they Crip Walk it ain't a dance 
 And when they Blood Walk it ain't a dance 
 When they Crip Walk it ain't a dance 
 And when they Blood Walk it ain't a dance
