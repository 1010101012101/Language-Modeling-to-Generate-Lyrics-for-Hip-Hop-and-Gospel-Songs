(Feat. Young Buck) 
 Young Buck: 
 Aiyo Spider Loc 
 I know 50 told ya man 
 These niggas be beefin' with G Unit 
 But when we catch these bitch ass niggas it's a different thang 
 Come on west side 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 When them haters start talkin' and them pistols start poppin' 
 They like I don't want no problems 
 Nigga I don't want no problems 
 Catch these niggas in the club when they think nobodys watchin' 
 They like I don't want no problems 
 Nigga I don't want no problems 
 If you scared say you scared don't be actin' like you 'bout it 
 Then say I don't want no problems 
 Nigga I don't want no problems 
 If its beef 
 Who 'gon take it to the streets 
 I ain't tryin' to hear that 
 I don't want no problems 
 Uh uh I don't want no problems 
 (Verse 1: Spider Loc) 
 I see you in the video lookin' hard 
 Catch you in my city I'm a pull your card 
 Better give G Unit full regard 
 Or I'm a take that bitch ass to the yard 
 Hook ass niggas just tickle me blue 
 Look at the gay ass shit he do 
 Wanna jump on the internet and cyber bang 
 Got the nerve to speak bad on Spider's name 
 I'm rider loco 
 You just you know oh so so definitely not in my class 
 Remember the last time I got that ass 
 I'm a gangbangin' nigga for real 
 And in the gang you a hard nigga to feel 
 West coast you know the nigga is ill 
 I'm EC Fif gave a nigga the scrill 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 When them haters start talkin' and them pistols start poppin' 
 They like I don't want no problems 
 Nigga I don't want no problems 
 Catch these niggas in the club when they think nobodys watchin' 
 They like I don't want no problems 
 Nigga I don't want no problems 
 If you scared say you scared don't be actin' like you 'bout it 
 Then say I don't want no problems 
 Nigga I don't want no problems 
 If its beef 
 Who 'gon take it to the streets 
 I ain't tryin' to hear that 
 I don't want no problems 
 Uh uh I don't want no problems 
 (Verse 2: Spider Loc) 
 Its hard in the hood when you can't return 
 You talk too much why can't you learn? 
 I got too much Gank to burn 
 With the bullshit threats I ain't concerned 
 Be a man why don't you tell them the truth 
 Ya passive in person yell in the booth 
 Washed up through every thug in the book 
 Crossed between a thug and a hook 
 Something like that cause ya ain't no Crip 
 Ya crack on site you ain't 'gon trip 
 I'm a hog and a half I ain't 'gon slip 
 Cut out the actin' this ain't no script 
 You can feel when this shits for real 
 What a nigga don't know till he hits his grill 
 I guess he do I cut the squabbin' 
 Look he like "Dude I don't want no problem" 
 (Chorus: Young Buck) 
 When them haters start talkin' and them pistols start poppin' 
 They like I don't want no problems 
 Nigga I don't want no problems 
 Catch these niggas in the club when they think nobodys watchin' 
 They like I don't want no problems 
 Nigga I don't want no problems 
 If you scared say you scared don't be actin' like you 'bout it 
 Then say I don't want no problems 
 Nigga I don't want no problems 
 If its beef 
 Who 'gon take it to the streets 
 I ain't tryin' to hear that 
 I don't want no problems 
 Uh uh I don't want no problems 
 Young Buck:
