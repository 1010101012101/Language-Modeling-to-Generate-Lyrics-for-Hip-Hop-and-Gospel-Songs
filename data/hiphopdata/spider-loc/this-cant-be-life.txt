(Chorus: spider-loc) 
 This can't be life 
 We try to get rich 
 Na ain't we nice 
 It's got to be more 
 She's a hore she can't be wife 
 We love goin' to war 
 We can't be right 
 Spider-loc: 
 My nigga drank coniak all day 
 And smoke coutch to the dark 
 For the neigborhoop picnics we push to the park 
 He's hit up to swap me the roll to the mark 
 Let 'em wrong we all meet up at the wall on the hall 
 And I ain't pain I let the home boy pat me down 
 My nigga ain't said shit about the gat he found 
 Hood rats on the dance floor shakin their ass sheeks 
 I'm waiting the beef to pop off from last week 
 Papa smurf: 
 I por an whole bottle of cryst out 
 For baby popa 
 I drank yact I bougth that for baby popa 
 Blowin' couthch think the of pow wow g 
 I miss sex I miss braze I miss the homie low lee 
 And seem like yesterday we was loaded bust 'em bitches up in your escalade 
 Now I'm fuckin' with spider reppin tha unit 
 Y'all my niggaz told me that I will do it 
 Big foot: 
 Money, talk and time are the essance 
 I'm havin' visit of my body on the stretcher 
 The street the hose the life that I treasure 
 Make cats bow down like the diploma maker 
 I'm like the first hit from the bangin' of the hair rhime 
 Blow past hits of tellin' those spers time 
 You better bounce 'cause I'm fellin 'em low lows 
 With the 2 pic white kicks and rose goe 
 Snoopy blu: 
 The homie drew stop bangin' still took they shoots 
 So I picc and die what kind of chance I got 
 I know he been to a biggier place so I try to limit space that I choose to go trough 
 They waiting to approch you 
 2 or 3 shots you gone just a memory 
 2 or 3 years I wonder why7 they don't remember me 
 So I try to live the best I can 
 Represent to my dead homies the best I can
