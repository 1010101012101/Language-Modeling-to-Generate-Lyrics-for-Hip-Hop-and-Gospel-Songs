 Watch me do what I do what I do what I do and I do it to you 
 Its Elementary 
 Just pay attention it ain't hard to tell 
 You can tell who sent me 
 With G-Unit clique its hard to fail 
 Why do y'all resent me 
 It ain't my fault that's hard to sell 
 And evidently 
 I'm doing too much far as I can tell 
 I'm just a bit better and better than best 
 And my wits better than the wit of the west 
 I'm stayin 7 steps ahead of the rest 
 And I've been heaven sent but never the less 
 You keep being impatient but never impressed 
 You got vocab issues that you need to address 
 You do weird type of things to relieve your stress 
 That can kill your whole career of you linked to press 
 Me and myself can fight us but I speak to bless 
 And within each verse we can deep vinness 
 You can call me the room 'cause I sweep the mess out the door tycoon well about to go!

 I get doe for the flow 'cause I got skills 
 Even more for the show 'cause I got bills 
 I'm on the role on the low 'cause I got wheels 
 Heard the song on the playback and I got chills (for real!) 
 It ain't no doubt to me 
 The amout of big skrill I'm about to see 
 Went to private sckool but turned out a G 
 I kept my eyes on fools and learned how to be 
 When its time to go though I show up the best 
 Who else is true enough to sew up the west (nobody!) 
 In the hood they like for us its S-P-I so fly with so much vinness 
 Y'all little chumps can't see my chips in change

 By now you should know you can't hang with me 
 'Cause I spit that flow and I bang that G (G-Unit!) 
 Us youngsta just went from rags to riches 
 And G-Unit kicks and we sag like britches 
 And we showin up is the worst surprise 
 My diamonds glow enough that'll hurt ya eyes 
 Yo money get at me but we first advise 
 Do I know how to put in work or wise 
 Yo wallets gonna have to be a certain size 
 And you can get that big head sircome sized 
 While you search them skies 
 I'm a merchandise 
 And mark it that way my work get rised 
 We can battle I got a freestyle degree 
 But for paper I don't kick styles for free 
 The journey to the top has been miles for me 
 And ima stay till it hit 3003
