 Flex the lex, now I'm like sex in the benz 
 Sex unstoppable is it possible to have sex and be friends 
 So come and ride this bronco, buck and dip 
 Can you picture this skinny cowboy, between them hips 
 No limit soldier, so come and ride me baby

 Gaurenteed to knock that ass out like you been beat up
