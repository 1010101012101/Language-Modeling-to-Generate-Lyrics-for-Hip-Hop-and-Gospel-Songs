(Master p) 
 You know what? 
 This ghetto got me so crazy 
 My life, it almost feel like I'm a phone call or ring away from death 
 Ain't this fucked up 
 Big ed, tell a story of the streets 
 (Big ed) 
 My nigga jay got his ass snatched, why wasn't he strapped 
 Kidnapped by four niggas dressed in black 
 Ah dats it, they called his momma 
 Told her, no joke, we got your son, she updated me on da drama 
 Her voice trembled, she was hysterical 
 The bounty was a hundred g's 
 For her to ante up, it would take a miracle 
 She's very spiritual 
 She got on her knees and prayed to God that I would help her yo 
 We'll get 'em back, I do anything to help my dawg 
 Try to relax, I hit you back, let me make some calls 
 For situations like this, 
 I keep a safe full of money with 100 round clips 
 I told my lady, get the cash and the mags 
 No questions asked we filled it up in a duffle bag 
 I through in my camoflauge fatiques 
 My a-r, a hand grenade, and an ounce of weed 
 Head out the front, put the bag in the truck right next to the m-1 
 And the pistol grip pump 
 Hit ma dawgs on the celly mercenary group of killers 
 We're methodical niggas with inferred triggers 
 Put the lexus in reverse, and let's roll double 0 
 Limo tint big body black four do' 
 Meet v-90 at the diner with burt bought my bad ass hoe china 
 Who smoke this dope out her vagina 
 Chocolate, jet black hair, slanted eyes you shoulda seen her 
 Bad ass body look, flexible like a ballarina 
 Seated at a booth, three niggas with broad and bullet proofs 
 Met for combat, made more calls, met up the troop 
 I told 'em jay got snatched 
 The dowen boys got connects on silencers for gats 
 Bring me four, meet me by jay mom's crib 
 I'll be there in ten, it's time to get it how we live 
 When I got there she said that the jackers know about me 
 That I got cheese with the miller boys at the calliope 
 Now they want two fifty, it's cool though 
 It's time to act a fool though, heard a knock at the front door 
 Reach up my shirt and put the gat to the peep hole 
 (Who is it?) it's my nigga boz, open up the door 
 And red nigga, these niggas down to kill nigga 
 But hold up, the plot gets thicker 
 He said, jay's a trick ass nigga, nobody snatched the nigga 
 He's plottin on me, tryin' to get richer 
 He's hiding at the motel six, room two twenty 
 How many hoes in this world, man nigga plenty 
 Boz got this hoe named wendy, stripper slash dancer 
 Red met her at chocolate sixty in atlanta 
 She got a twin sister candy, boz hooked candy to jay 
 Jay fell in love with the hoe and got a baby on the way 
 But he's broke and busted, down and out disgusted 
 Scheming on me, him and candy discussed it 
 Candy told wendy, and wendy told red 
 Red told me my nigga jay wants me dead 
 Not my nigga, but I gotta investigate 
 We drove to the motel six, seen his car, checked the liscense plate 
 (Yeah that's him) see what happens when you try to pack fair 
 Peeped in the window, seen jay gettin' rolled in the chair 
 That's that hoe candy, workin it backwards 
 Lookin' at her titties got my dick hard like she's a private dancer 
 Kicked the door down, his pants down, my gat in his face 
 Pushed the hoe off the nigga and shot his dick off his waist 
 And that naked hoe candy pussy is wide open 
 Jay can't believe she betrayed him, his eyes is wide open 
 Jay tell me why nigga, before you die nigga 
 I would have gave you some money, didn't have to lie nigga 
 But I can't kill ya cause a nigga love you too much 
 So v-90 shoot him in his head and throw him in his own trunk 
 Watch your click (watch your click) 
 Cause niggas switch when you get rich 
 That tek and ski mask cause life's a bitch
