 Oh yeah, and to our enemies 
 We don't hate you but uh, we got a place for ya 
 Cause uh 
 Somebody goin' die tonight 
 No limit assassins goin' ride tonight (what's up big ed nigga) 
 Somebody goin' die tonight 
 No limit assassins goin' ride tonight 
 Uh, ha ha 
 My motherfuckin guns and my duty nigga 
 And let me handle my motherfuckin business 
 I served an ounce of cocain, and now I'm trapped in this game 
 So much weed to the brain, got you bangin' for change 
 But I'm a no limit soldier, tattooed in blood 
 Federal oz's sold keys and now heroin and drugs 
 And this game got me trapped 'cause I've been bustin' at bitches 
 And I've been standin on these projects countin' up keys and kits 
 And these hoes wanna kill me, see me dead 'cause I'm rollin' 
 And everything that I ride I pay with cash it's not stolen 
 Now I don't trip on no bitches and I don't trip on no niggas 
 You wanted the dope and some cain, now how'm I supposed to deliver 
 I got my game that's my g, I fuck with killers and ballers 
 I live for today and tonight so nigga fuck tomorrow 
 See I'm a soldier for life, give me my duties and my stripes 
 And fuck everybody else, and we gotta ride tonight 
 See I'm a soldier for life, give me my duties and my stripes 
 And fuck everybody else, and we gotta ride tonight 
 (Big ed) 
 I'm on my way to n.o. with four keys of cocain 
 I got murder on my brain with the trunk full of thangs 
 P told me meet him uptown, it's time to get dirty (third ward) 
 Got a bunch of niggas tatted up screamin ya heard me 
 Got them 'bout it 'bout it bitches ready to fuck 
 I said it 'bout it 'bout it nigga, 'cause they're ready to bust 
 Put my guns in the sky (sky), bullets goin' fly (fly) 
 And I ain't satisfied till all my enemies die 
 (Master p) 
 See I'm a soldier for life, give me my duties and my stripes 
 And fuck everybody else, and we gotta ride tonight 
 See I'm a soldier for life, give me my duties and my stripes 
 And fuck everybody else, and we gotta ride tonight 
 Now drive nigga 
 We did that 
 No limit soldier! 
 Woo woo!
