(Master P talking) 
 Ugh 
 Niggas be trying to figure out how we roll out here in Cali 
 You know what I'm saying 
 Richmond California 
 My little partners be rolling like Sick fool 
 Six deep hittin' switches, that's how us G's ride 
 Candy paint with them gold daytons side to side 
 Niggas straight fucking bumpin' 
 Niggas trippin', think I'm from Compton 
 I'm from that South side of Richmond where that hang ya 
 Put you in a motherfucking 6 inch slanger 
 Lay you down, drop you to your knees, you want some chesse 
 Break me off some ends before I make your ass bleed 
 From your nose to your mouth up and outtie 
 Niggas talking shit cause Master P is gettin' rowdy 
 Got the southside, hoop ride throwin' a 40 
 Niggas gangbangin like they straight retarded 
 Throwin' up signs, Niggas in line 
 Bitches hollerin' hoo-ride, Niggas steady dying 
 I'm from the southside 23rd street 
 And my little homie Tony from the hills, may he rest in peace 
 No longer with the crew or the click 
 But to the niggas that did this shit, we gonna go thick click 
 And get them thangs and hang ya 
 Fuckin' round, keep one up in the chamber 
 Richmond niggaz don't play 'cause we ballin' 
 And I got this thang sowed up from New Orleans 
 Coming like a southside gator 
 And when we roll on your spot, beware of the true terminators 
 6 deep is how us G's ride, 
 Candy paint gold daytons hittin' switches from side to side 
 6 deep is how us G's ride, 
 Candy paint gold daytons hittin' switches from side to side 
 Well it's Friday, I'm sideways about the highway 
 Bitches doing it my way, got 2 for 5, everyday all day 
 'Cause I gots to get paid, gets mine in the 9, that's why I stay strapped 
 Everyday I gots to put it down, it be like that 
 I have a pocket full of stones, I gots like clock now 
 It was kinda hot outside so I had to puts the top down 
 I be like breezin' through the East Bay 
 Are-I-see-H-M-0-N to the see-A, that's where I still be at each day 
 Big Ed be puttin' it down like that, made more ass than the Hilton 
 On my way to this hoe's house, bang that ass until its tiltin' 
 Now I'm rollin', holdin' onto a fat nickel plated 9 
 I blasted at him who trying to take mine so forget the 1 time 
 So when a brother rolls up, hold up 
 Don't make me plug your trick ass like a donut 
 See Big Ed's about that mint green 
 Got them hoes' feening for this dick, like it was laced with nicotine 
 Killa pussy got 'em slippin' up in the hood 
 Them Green Berets up in Richmond, I know they up to no good 
 Tried to jet me on that down low 
 I have more niggas shootin's up your set then the feds did at Waco 
 Player haters could never stop me 
 'Cause I'm a No Limit Nigga and got more Crew then Motley 
 So if you ever try to play me like a hoe 
 I'm hanging up out the door, with the 44, nigga drive slow 
 (Master P talking) 
 And we up and outtie, it looks cloudy, 
 'Cause y'all niggas spinning daytons, 
 (No Limit niggas) on your motherfuckers turf, 
 (Soldier For Life, No Limit 4-Life) 
 And for all y'all niggaz that done sold out, 
 We be keeping it real, 
 Independent, black owned, 
 Running our own shit, 
 We drop shit anytime we want to, anytime we ready, 
 How many y'all niggas can say that? 
 I just might drop something tomorrow
