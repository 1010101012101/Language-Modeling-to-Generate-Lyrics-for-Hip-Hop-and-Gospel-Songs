(Big ed) 
 Yo, funky sons, help me out 
 (Sons of funk) 
 I'm yo soldier (every soldier needs some thug love) 
 You'll never find another (every soldier needs some thug love) 
 I'm yo soldier (every soldier nees some thug love) 
 You'll never find another (every soldier needs some thug love) 
 Like me 
 (Big ed) 
 Had my back ever since I was pulling 211's 
 The rich dude, I was on my knees trying to shoot a seven 
 Even when there's no food in the fridge, you say you're lucky to have me 
 Never tripped on the life I live 
 You had my kid, you held my strap to prove it's for life 
 You got lady assassin tatted on your back, sometimes I don't act like I should 
 You still understand what I'm going through, the pressures from the hood 
 I'm trying to make it all good forever 
 I can't see living life without me and you together 
 I know I'm gone a lot trying to make it, but just have patience 
 It's all for you, my soul I'll stake it 
 (Silkk tbe shocker) 
 See you're a star, met you at the bar, seen you through the cartier frames 
 Excuse me miss, I'm silkk the shocker, tru is the clique that I claim 
 Money and wealth, good times and bad times, that just comes with the game 
 Don't trip on the females and shit, miss, look, that just, like, 
 Comes with the name 
 I need a down girl that's down to ride 
 See that girl, look, 3-5-5 ferrari parked up on the outside 
 I live the life of a thug, that's why I'm never smiling 
 Got out the projects with my thugs, I'm probably on some like island 
 See, I'm a soldier and I need a soldierette like you 
 Hot tubs, backrubs, celebrating over dinner for two 
 Said you wanna go to war, let's see if you can last for the 2nd round 
 And I don't know, there's something about ya, makes silkk the shocker 
 Wanna settle down 
 Now what, I told ya 
 (Master p) 
 I hang with killas and gees to get my cash on 
 I need a thug girl at night to get my smash on 
 Lingerie with the camoflague (camoflague) 
 Hennessey with the weed, baby girl I'm at the front line 
 And we can do it till we weak (till we weak) 
 A little isley brothers, me and you, between the sheets 
 In the game getting rowdy (ungh!) 
 But don't trip, 'cause tonight me and you gonna get 'bout it 'bout it 
 Huh bruh? 
 Repeat chorus twice
