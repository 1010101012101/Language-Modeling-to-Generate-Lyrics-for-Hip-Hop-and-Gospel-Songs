(Big ed) 
 I am the hardest 
 Nigga on wax, big ed back (assass' on) 
 No limit soldier retracts, I got my blast on 
 Hard to the bone, military minded nigga 
 We started this shit, must I remind you niggas 
 So I'm going all out, motherfuck the fall out 
 I'll blow the wall on these hundred round drums 
 And the I haul out, won't stop, can't stop, 
 Before I stop, you drop, get retarted 
 I am the hardest 
 One on stage, bust with a rage, 
 I keep the crowd bucked like a gauge, hyper's my trade 
 I give the crowd rowdy hooks, associated with crooks 
 Dance floor filled with jabbing right hooks 
 I get the crowd shook, and they don't wanna dance no mo' 
 Cause all my thug niggas fighting on the floor 
 Throw you set up, I'm not the tightest or most lyrical artist 
 But - 
 I am the hardest 
 Nigga what you want? shit you ride on your enemies 
 Hooks that make 'em bleed, for all my niggas that's on the streets 
 I won't stop this how I eat, so fuck all y'all who question me 
 Bust hardcore rhymes over harcore beats 
 I am the hardest 
 Rapper, point blank period 
 Player you could run up and make this whole thing serious 
 Mess around and get me furious 
 Oh you'se the hardest, I can believe that I'm hearing this 
 Just because you sold more units don't make you harder 
 It just means your record executes were alittle bit smarter 
 Boy you better get up out the quarter 
 I am the hardest 
 One with the mic, I'm not the tightest, that's mystikal 
 But I get this motherfucker physical 
 Go to dallas, chi-town, indy, a-t-l 
 St. louis in the streets they know me well 
 In orlando I got 'em taking it to the trunk 
 On this album I'ma give 'em all what they want 
 Full blown funk, and yo big l, run that shit let's get it started 
 I am the hardest 
 Nigga what you want? shit you ride on your enemies 
 Hooks that make 'em bleed, for all my niggas that's on the streets 
 I won't stop this how I eat, so fuck all y'all who question me 
 Bust hardcore rhymes over harcore beats 
 I am the hardest 
 Soldier in this war, this game we call rap 
 Kick the door in with 10 straps, explosive habits 
 Must I relate back to pimps, hustlers, gangstas and macks 
 I keep gats and I bust 'em just like that *guns fires* 
 Hoes sweatin' out they perm, they got 'fro backs 
 See I'ma throw back with other switch styles to the keep the floor packed 
 Fuck you haters I'ma get mine regardless 
 I am the hardest
