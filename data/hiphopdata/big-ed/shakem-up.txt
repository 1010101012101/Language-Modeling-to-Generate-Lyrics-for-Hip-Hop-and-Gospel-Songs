 Nigga ride with me, ride with me, die with me, die with me

 Don't nobody cry, just keep my name in the sky 
 Tattoo me, retaliate on them niggas that do me

 You resent that, you meet my nigga dirty black, that's what I call the gat 
 Shell sheezie, ask my nigga b neezie 
 Big man, big champ, big hurt, don't make them killers go to work 
 >From the south to the east to the middle to the west 
 Represent your hood, show me where them killers at

 Flash backs of crooked niggas crossin my tie

 And let the world know, I shake 'em up fa sho 
 And I ride with these gambinos, ? ? ? ? ? feino

 Fuckin' with these made niggas who don't give a fuck 
 Now you stuck, layin on your back flat line 
 Fuckin' with fieno, do one the boss they call ? ? ? 
 Bullets be flyin, closed caskets from automatics 
 Lives be drastic, these niggas be endin up in plastic 
 Shit is drastic, mad these niggas ain't laughin' 
 And they wonder why a nigga like me keep on blastin
