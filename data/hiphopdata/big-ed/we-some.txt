 (Crooked eye) 
 Stick 'em up, how you like establish 98 
 Big ed is the assassin, with a fresh cut cake 
 No shakes, bet these mob niggas can't wait 
 For sausa teach the hits from the south to the yay 
 Lay 'em down, military minded made niggas 
 Low to the last don still up we paid niggas 
 Grave diggers be nothin' on gods earth that bleed 
 Stay tru to the game and keep close my enemies 
 Pushing crates and tapes all across the states 
 It used to be d, but now it's street rap CD's 
 With made niggas, highly paid niggas 
 Killers on the payroll, so step nigga, roll niggas 
 Put a hit out on me I put one out on you 
 You test one of my soldiers I take your whole crew 
 Banana clip in, bavgate and sausa 
 Commanded by the colonel p, don't like it we lost ya 
 (Big ed) 
 Nigga I say shit like dips quick to empty out clips 
 Big ed and steady mobbin fuck up your block in one dip 
 It ain't no stoppin' 'cause we military minded niggas 
 My first phrase as a kid was momma pass the trigger 
 The captian of this tank no limit soldier up in this bitch 
 Making moves with my thugs nigga I plan to be rich 
 Tatted up strapped tight with tek 9's and glocks 
 I'm hittin switches in the four nigga make the front hop 
 So nigga how many niggas wanna ride with me 
 I call my niggas when my enemies collide with me 
 Tank dawgs be the niggas that would for die for me 
 Cause nina war make them hollow tips fly for me 
 Steady mobbin got the ghost town riders 
 And nigga I'm tru for life, so can't nuttin come beside us 
 The colonel got the tank bustin' on you niggas 
 Ground troops of war got killers dumpin on y'all niggas 
 (Billy bavgate) 
 Bavgate screaming mary jane when I mob 
 Nigga point to the west like sadaam 
 Rowdy like the ? ? ?, nigga off the hook like a baker 
 Ghost town niggas keep one up in the chamber 
 I lived rough as a youth when I was growing up 
 Tryin' to come up I hit a lick on a cigarette truck 
 I ain't giving a fuck 
 I'm gettin' loose your main mafia nigga in the movie 
 Big ed pumpin lead till they dead 
 I'm a gangsta gettin' watched by the feds 
 Bavgate gettin' high till my last day 
 No limit soldier till the comet hit the motherfucking bay
