Yeah! 
 2Mex clusive 
 Yeah 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 The return of Fernandomania 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 The return of Fernandomania 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 The return of Fernandomania 
 My name is 2Mex I'm not afraid of the cops I 
 Just live, check to check and I stay hip hop 
 I got a brand new cd that I know you don't got 
 I got my own fat section at the mom and pops 
 And I'm the 
 Reason that your little brothers not a gangster 
 I'd like to take a little bit of time to just thank you 
 For buying imitations to weak toys 
 You've spawned a new nation of b-boys 
 The bling bling stuff was a mirage 
 I got your sister doing head spins in the garage 
 And you can pass the XO pass the Hennessey 
 Pass me the X-Clan and Public Enemy 
 The straight best from the underground west 
 You should buy a kid a book and not a bullet proof 
 Vest so if you're wondering why you should even try 
 All eyez are on me but I'm not ready to die 
 So when you feel down like you don't belong 
 And you actually care about lyrics in a song 
 I got this brand new drug 
 And it's the bomb 
 Its called run back home and hug your mom 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 The return of Fernandomania 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 The return of Fernandomania 
 My name is 2Mex and I'm proud to be brown 
 In L.A. I got a ghetto pass I'm allowed to be down 
 I'm a walk into your town like a bum or a clown 
 As soon as I open my mouth you hear the lyrics sound 
 I'm a miracle elephant it' s not a miracle (?) 
 West coast underground hip-hop is relevant 
 So go ahead and dissolve in the illusion 
 I know this song won' t solve the resolution 
 You might catch me in an Escalade 
 But I don't make hip hop to have sex and get paid 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 The return of Fernandomania 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 The return of Fernandomania 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 And the chow shall feed them 
 The return of Fernandomania
