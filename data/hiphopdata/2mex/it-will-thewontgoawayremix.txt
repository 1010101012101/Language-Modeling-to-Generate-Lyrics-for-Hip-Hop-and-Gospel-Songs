 Los Angeles lungs, love in lower lights 
 Oceans of organic opals overwright 
 Subliminal sorcerers satellite 
 Attempt sacrificial after life, after light 
 Not natural night 
 Giggling girls, gigabytes 
 Earth ending, extraterrestrial heights 
 Lyrically lines lynch the laptop leper (?) 
 Each execution emphasizes effort 
 Synonym surgery, satellite sits 
 Heatedly (?), I'm hearsay, hollow point hits 
 Indigenous idiosyncrasies 
 Pulling pistols upon political enemies 
 Hard-hider (?) holding Hell's history 
 Older organs, odd and ogre-ly 
 Pathological purgery 
 World wide emergency, why wouldn't we 
 Introduce ideas instantly, intricately 
 Live and lift off a linear leaf 
 Leveling off illogically 
 Several sonic subjects asleep 
 All audible angels alive asking 
 Vibrate invisible visionary vaccine 
 Escape exactly 
 Tackling those that try to track me 
 Heartfelt hello to hard heroes hacking 
 Everyone evolve, elevate eyes 
 "We won" is worth the wait, we wonder why 
 Obstacle absorb outside 
 Re-revolutionize your rubbery ride 
 Leave losers lurking in layers of lies 
 Don't doubt dissention, deserters will die 
 Word, word... word, word, word, word 
 Word, word... word, word, word, word
