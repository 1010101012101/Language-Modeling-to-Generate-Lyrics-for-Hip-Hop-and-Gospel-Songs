[Ass to mouth, ass to mouth (x3) 
 When I drop shit I'm all that you ask about] x2 
 Made a big splash on the gossip column 
 When I hit the rock bottom 
 In the street, spending electric bills 
 I'm dumb enough to try to reinvent the wheel 
 And it's volunteered 
 Just for the names on the blogosphere (?) 
 I'm finna give what you want to hear 
 Oh, Yeah 
 My outbursts set the bar high 
 Wildfires set with our supplies 
 Rotisserie'd and MRI'd 
 They keep taking shots like bar flies 
 And I return fire! 
 I return fire 
 I return fire 
 Aroused in the midst of a church choir 
 All the freaks in the seats need to get engaged (?) 
 So the intelligentsia acts barely drinking age 
 It sound like 
 [Ass to mouth, ass to mouth (x3) 
 When I drop shit I'm all that you ask about] x2 
 If you think I've eaten my fill, well you've heard wrong 
 My stomach's only filled with birdsong 
 My body's waste is like precious metal 
 So I walk around thinking I'm extra special 
 But I'm the Antichrist! 
 I'm the Antichrist 
 I'm the Antichrist 
 So what I say, it can't be blessed 
 They eat shit sandwiches at the discotheque 
 And they talk about me to keep their whistles wet
