(Get up, get down) x7 
 I should just (get up) 
 And treat these itchy bedsores 
 (Get up) to making my indie-cred soar 
 (Get up) my witty thread bores your kiddy pool party 
 (Get up) this self-absorbed crowd is dumb and foolhardy 
 (Get up) to face that's like a homepage 
 (Get up) in a day as long as the stone age 
 (Get up) I'm a quadruped pulling your dogsled 
 (Get up) Yet in my mind we are all dead (all dead, all dead, all dead) 
 (Get down) 
 Hey, I'm always telling them to (get up) 
 But they stand-by like bystanders until I (get down) 
 They're camera-shy giant pandas and when they (get up) 
 They can't comply to my standards especially when I (get down) 
 They're camera-shy giant pandas and when they (get up) 
 But they stand-by like bystanders until I (get down) 
 They're camera-shy giant pandas and when they (get up) 
 They can't comply to my standards especially when I (get down) 
 They're camera-shy giant pandas and when they (get up) 
 Your retro hair band's gonna blow up 
 'Cause gay is the new black 
 And when you stray LA won't take you back 
 I'm supposed to spearhead this Christian rap record 
 And not the musings of a winded fact-checker 
 So I feel about an inch tall 
 And I got pre-teens to enthrall 
 So I pimp all the cost shares, install the software 
 But still I feel like my back is against the wall 
 (Get down) 
 Hey, I'm always telling them to (get up) 
 But they stand-by like bystanders until I (get down) 
 They're camera-shy giant pandas and when they (get up) 
 They can't comply to my standards especially when I (get down) 
 They're camera-shy giant pandas and when they (get up) 
 But they stand-by like bystanders until I (get down) 
 They're camera-shy giant pandas and when they (get up) 
 They can't comply to my standards especially when I (get down) 
 They're camera-shy giant pandas and when they (get up) 
 'Cause you can ward off U.S. wars 
 By fingering warped fret boards 
 See we exploit our talents so we can raise kids 
 Like my homie Trey, he's the poor women's Taye Diggs 
 But when it comes to love I stain the bedding 
 Catching bouquets at the wedding 
 But this don't go hand and hand with your Volkswagon van 
 Because you voted in a defrosted Cro-Magnon man 
 (Get up) The Troglodyte wins (get down) 
 Because you voted in a defrosted Cro-Magnon man 
 (Get up) The Troglodyte wins (get down) 
 Because you voted in a defrosted Cro-Magnon man 
 (Get up) The Troglodyte wins (get down) 
 Because you voted in a defrosted Cro-Magnon man 
 (Get up) The Troglodyte wins (get down) 
 Because you voted in a defrosted Cro-Magnon man 
 I'm always tellin' them that. 
 We don't believe in you
