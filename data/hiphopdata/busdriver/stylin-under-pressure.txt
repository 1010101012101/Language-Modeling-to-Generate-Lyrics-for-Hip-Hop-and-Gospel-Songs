(A conversation at a drive-through at a Carl's Jr. between Busdriver and the employee) 
 Yes... 
 (Welcome to Carl's Jr. Can I help you?) 
 Yes. I am a head hunter. I am looking for the ultimate woman sex lover, 
 But it's hard to stay in line 
 So I have to take the next number 
 And can't find anybody in the dead of summer. 
 But you know what, I think I'll have the fries. 
 (Anything else?) 
 Umm... Hmmmm... 
 Actually, give me a happy meal 
 With a rapper who doesn't have any skill, 
 But has a contract for half a 'mill 
 Served up with a plate full of daffodils. 
 That will do it for me. 
 (Ok, would you really like to order because... What is it that you want?) 
 Give me a... hmmm 
 You know what, give me a person burger 
 'Cause eating a hamburger is worse than murder 
 So I would prefer that. 
 (A What!?) 
 Give me a million dollars how 'bout that? 
 (...) 
 Give me a Super Star. 
 (A super star?) 
 Yeah. 
 (You want the combo for that?) 
 'Cause I'm a super star 
 But you don't know who we are. 
 (Just a Super Star?) 
 Hmmm... 
 Yes. A Super Star 
 'Cause I'm known to tutor at bars 
 And, hmm, uh oh! 
 Yes. A Super Star. 
 (Ok. Just drive to the window for...) 
 And also, give me a medium drink. 
 How 'bout a medium Sprite 
 'Cause I'm exceeding them sights upon me 
 With all type of digital cameras 
 I'm cynical sigh, sky scanner. 
 Woo! 
 A medium Sprite, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 (Ok one Super Star, one medium Sprite. Is that all?) 
 Yes, yes, yes. 
 (Ok. Drive to the window.) 
 And umm... hmmm... 
 Can you recommend anything? 
 (Umm... like what?) 
 I don't know. 
 Anything, anywhere. 
 (I don't... I don't know.) 
 Anything, anywhere 
 'Cause I'm a tall, lonely teddy bear 
 Who occupies empty air. 
 I'm not a millionaire, 
 I'm a penny-aire. 
 Yes. 
 (...) 
 That's it. That's it. 
 (Ok. Drive to the window.)
