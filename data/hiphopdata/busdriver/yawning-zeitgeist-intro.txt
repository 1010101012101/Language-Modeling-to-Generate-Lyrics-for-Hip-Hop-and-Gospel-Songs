Hello, I'm conducting a survey, 
 And I have some questions to ask you 
 First off, 
 Do you have a fear of a black tangent? 
 Were you born in the year of the rat? 
 Do you cheer and clap, 
 When weird rap bands commence? 
 I can tell by your answer you'll probably won't frolic with me in the foot hills 
 And that you want your tofu patty cooked, not grilled 
 But it doesn't matter. You've been enticed 
 And drawn in with my hook and reel 
 (I write words.) 
 Oprah nods to to my novel 
 (I write words) 
 As you can see it sells very prominently in Boulder, Colorado 
 LOL: laugh out loud 
 You've never known hell so well 
 Until you identified with a black crowd 
 It's a fear of a black tangent, idiot 
 A Public Enemy spoof 
 Now some of your friends will reboot the computer 
 Then you will Google search 
 And be discouraged when they find out that truthful hurt 
 When they see that I am not their zeitgiest 
 Nor am I Christ-like 
 Nor do I dislike whites 
 I just want a better chance 
 'Cause most likely I'll sell more records in France
