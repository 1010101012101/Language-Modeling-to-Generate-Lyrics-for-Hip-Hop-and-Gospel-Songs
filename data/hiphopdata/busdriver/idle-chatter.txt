Every minute people die and 
 every other minute people are born. 
 How did you spend that minute and 
 what was your involvement in either or? 
 There's secret wars 
 radioactive fallout 
 poison seeps in your pores 
 so keep indoors 
 I would give you more details 
 but I really have to be on my way 
 Go ahead and run 
 with your CD player as your escape pod 
 Your unfaithful god is your paycheck from your day job 
 but life spits on your eyes 
 of you fleeing TV-Land's compost heap 
 Be the apex of chaos 
 have safe sex with stray dogs 
 Until you age fully any skin cream 
 Will turn a Cindy Lauper into a Cindy Crawford 
 But won't tell you that you could be eaten alive 
 at any city block or die by a Mossberg 
 Isn't self-pity awkward when your inner voice is a songbird, 
 muffled in your beliefs are incomplete crossword puzzles 
 And your subconscious aquifer's been drained to a water puddle. 
 I would love to sit and chat, 
 but I got to be on my way 
 I'm sorry I don't have the time 
 to shoot the breeze or chew the fat 
 (???) fruits in the trees and I lose track 
 You want a bright future to be pitch black, 
 so I got to be on my way. 
 I'm sorry there's no time allotted for your hijinks 
 So you should be fly-swatted at least that's what I think 
 Go ahead and spend but the dollar bill is nature's suicide note 
 Seek refuge at late hours in the Mayflowers 
 like goin' from bottled cans and holograms to cities full of Robocops who bleed soda pop 
 The good beauty and is why (??) love is a photo op and (??) is a coke rock 
 Even the stars in the penthouse become sparse when I do another head count 
 But it's a good day to die and I've been digging a ditch 
 So I wave goodbye to what did exist 
 with demoralizing the democratic demigods I get a pedagogue 
 and dog fights all in my steady job its to break your fault line 
 when its all dark and call a ball or strike in the ball park 
 You forgot a small part, the rarest item is wine with therapists in the asylum 
 You would be embarrassed if I died young 
 Maybe because you felt that Meredith was a shy nun 
 And you just took credit for which when she was high strung 
 but you didn't know from terrorists she'd buy guns 
 When you knew too much she threw you off the terrace when you tried to run 
 Luckily a cypher full of wack MCs broke your fall 
 Now you cherish the rise of the sun after that close call 
 And cherish what I said most of all 
 I would love to sit and chat but I've got to be on my way 
 I'm sorry I don't have the time to shoot your breeze or chew the fat(??) fruits in the trees and I lose track 
 I want a bright future to be pitch black so I've got to be on my way 
 I'm sorry sir there's no time allotted, therefore I had to fly swat it 
 I've got it, driver's fiber optic is really a fine tuned instrument 
 In inseparable moments tween you and your loved ones 
 Thugs come from far or near, all with their scars, then leave tears 
 Coming down their cheekbone, you seek the clones 
 What about speak in the zone, that is unbelievable 
 and California need to get a beach comb 
 To find the edible tidbits and little bytes and gigabytes of information 
 a megabyte a betcha byte a bigga bite when you come here 
 But I'll stretch your life out in a long time sequence, long term 
 Strong germ, that's what I am 
 Analyzing every petri dish 
 You know that I'm so secretive 
 So just..shh shh.. keep in on the hush hush
