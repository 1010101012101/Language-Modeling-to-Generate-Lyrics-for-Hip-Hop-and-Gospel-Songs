I plant a kiss on both your cheeks 
 We make love so you won't go to sleep 
 'Cause your face can inspire global peace 
 Or leave me dead in your arms 
 I need to be a mogul at least 
 And to get that Volvo leased 
 Keep these hoes off my scrotal crease 
 To keep you in my dreams don't set the alarm 
 Kiss me back to life 
 'Cause you killed it last night 
 (Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Let's live again 
 Kiss me back to life 
 'Cause you killed it last night 
 (Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Let's live again 
 I'm more than a boyfriend 
 I'm a mistake to learn from 
 I'm more than a boyfriend 
 I'm a mistake to live through 
 From the hurt we won't rebound fast 
 But hurt is what our dreams outlast 
 Your friends keep talking that greenhouse gas 
 Why won't they believe in us? 
 I'm a disintegrating mess 
 I'm a family Xmas 
 I'm a flag half-mast 
 You complete me 
 Let me take your hand 
 Yeah I'm a space program 
 Kiss me back to life 
 'Cause you killed it last night 
 (Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Let's live again 
 Kiss me back to life 
 'Cause you killed it last night 
 (Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh) Let's live again 
 I'm more than a boyfriend 
 I'm a mistake to learn from 
 I'm more than a boyfriend 
 I'm a mistake to live through
