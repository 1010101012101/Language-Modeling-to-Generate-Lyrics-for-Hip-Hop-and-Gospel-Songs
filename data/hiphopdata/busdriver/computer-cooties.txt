By now its clear 
 I've got computer cooties. 
 Go so hard it's like I co-starred in a Ferris Bueler Movie. 
 You do so much, 
 ??Grobiluch??? 
 ??Phillip Bluser movies??? 
 With my eyes closed shut I make the ??waities seven hooters oozy? 
 Step on the bear trap, 
 Nigger your whole crew is booty. 
 This is paralax, 
 For all you confused noobies. 
 I be on the prayer mat, 
 Make you remove your ??coovie?? 
 You wont know where you're at. 
 But I do, Los Angeles. Come on. 
 You're in my world buckaroo. 
 Press the space bar, 
 And your bank car's cut in two. 
 Your right I piss on English, 
 I'm like a London Loo. 
 You talk shit about the bleau nigga and we'll bludgeon you. 
 Yeah you say your bleau is sickly, 
 But they got the stomach flu. 
 Everybody knows or ??Stani? knows ain't nothing new. 
 To reach this height you, 
 Can't climb ladders. 
 On this carpet, I can harness, antimatter. 
 And my grubby mits, 
 Funny its, 
 Number way I make money? 
 But when I live this way I feel you can't die faster. 
 Make your glass eye shatter. 
 Black music, a little ??berry boardy??? 
 My scary stories make the camp site scatter 
 Yeah I slap white rappers 
 Put the money on the lazy suzan. 
 Cause you treat the bleau to like it was an ancient ruin. 
 Niggas crowd behind vernon lee 
 Problem solved like the big lebowski 
 I'm sucking dope out of cotton balls 
 Y'all bitches got titties for days 
 I kick the karate class and step, 
 You match ricky gervais. 
 His body mass defects 
 So when you goof off nobody laughs in jest 
 I'm bobbing for cash with mint breath. 
 Niggas beck for my critical area 
 Less than that gesture that 
 With a cynical stare yeah 
 We ain't playing for the same team, 
 Your sponsored by maybeline. 
 Dip yourself in anti aging cream. 
 Nobody buys when you commit to celluloid, 
 The sale is void. 
 I'm a self employed dapper dan 
 Climbing out the alabaster cans of a pregnant whore, 
 Can't get board, the crowd would clap their hands but 
 This is not what was on the agenda 
 There was comfort food, that puts your body in splenda 
 But the head?? beans was wrong, 
 We've been stressed in advance 
 But our city grids designer breast implants 
 Come on 
 Niggas step through get reduced to glue. 
 ... Really fast, I can't reliably transcribe the rest of this song...
