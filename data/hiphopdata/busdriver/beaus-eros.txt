(I won't listen 
 Because I know everything 
 All the time, absolutely 
 And you knew this when you fell in love with what was left of me 
 So let's give it another shot, young missy 
 Come on) 
 I must think I'm some 
 Sort of Rocketeer 
 Saving you from 
 Your awkward years 
 Gaping holes look like diamond mines 
 Through the ethos of a young man's dying mind 
 Ooh, I don't know the way 
 Ooh, I'm just in the way 
 Parting your patterned shirt 
 Setting off the amber alert 
 And leap from your brow into 
 A heat-distorted me 
 Beaus and eros, beaus and eros 
 Yeah 
 Commit my body to the undergrowth 
 Cause life as I knew it has gone up in a puff of smoke 
 We embroidered clouds with pillow talk and thunderbolts 
 Broke child labor laws putting in work as young adults 
 Now you catch feelings, I catch planes 
 To avoid any meaningful exchange 
 My embrace is the icy grip of a mortician's 
 Speed dating with me, you scream out "Abort Mission" 
 (X2) Ooh, I don't know the way 
 Ooh, I'm just in the way 
 Parting your patterned shirt 
 Setting off the amber alert 
 And leap from your brow into 
 A heat-distorted me 
 Ooh, I don't know the way 
 Ooh, I'm just in the way 
 Parting your patterned shirt 
 Setting off the amber alert
