Is this on? (x2) 
 No shit! 
 I've been waiting for you to produce the black experience; a Super Series of fly-by-night catch phrasing 
 And for every hiccup that I might sight for me to be labeled wide-eyed and trite 
 As a forest nymph in stretch plating 
 'Exclamation point apostrophe slash' is what you get when your Modus operandi comes off like a comedy gag 
 It's like being spoon fed from a colostomy bag of an old androgyny hag 
 That got all of us hard-numb-palmed and deep fried 
 You know that! 
 (x2) 
 I know you, you know me 
 I'm from the project blowed family 
 With a pitch match nasty scratch give a song a home 
 If a known band is holding its own 
 Sorry, underground hip-hop happened ten years ago 
 Imagine having to say this at the Pan-African theater group bake sale 
 It's been painted over like a glazed crayon pedicure 
 And the mantra's been scrambled into this crazed non-sequitur 
 Sorry, underground hip-hop happened ten years ago 
 These words stay parenthesized between two reticent moon halves 
 So go tell them douche bags their white tees look like night gowns 
 While I loaf under the awning of my moral high ground 
 Yeah! 
 No shit! 
 Y'all got salt water colonics 
 While my alma mater's polish was hallmark worthy 
 No shit! 
 And though my small squad is modest 
 I'm a cross-journal lobbyist 
 Here to install thoughts with moral conflicts 
 Oh! 
 Still girls do not sing mucho gusto papi 
 Nor to I get kudos for being a pseudo-commie 
 'Cause I let niggas down like Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
 Being overboard like a cruise boat volley 
 Fools suck my glucose? 
 (x2) 
 I know you, you know me 
 I'm from the project blowed family 
 With a pitch match nasty scratch give a song a home 
 If a known band is holding its own
