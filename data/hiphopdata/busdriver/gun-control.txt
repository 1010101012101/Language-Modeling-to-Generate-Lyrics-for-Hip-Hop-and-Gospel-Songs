(Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up) 
 Hey! 
 Cheaper cheeba, cheaper cheeba 
 I think it would be cheaper if I grow your cheeba 
 Hide your beeper, ride a zebra 
 I wonder why you glorify 9 millimeters 
 Shimmy shoot (scat) at revolving doors 
 Wild on the floor, involved in war, or crawling on all fours 
 Gun control! 
 Hey! 
 Why would you pride yourself on being a Luger holder 
 When the only gun you held is a SuperSoaker? 
 But I'm a killer finger, but I'm a millimeter 
 Look on your face look just like gorilla sphincter. 
 When the NRA gave you the middle finger 
 Told you that you couldn't join the gun club due to your ethnic background 
 Said you were born from the septic trash mound 
 So put the gun back down 
 You may think your tough, bullet-proofed up 
 But the men who carry guns got mullets and crew cuts. 
 White conservatives, who formed the oligarchy 
 Who'll call you "darkie", and they hate commies and Paul McCartney 
 The two nigga shooting at the general cinema 
 But their self-image is a mental enema. 
 Plus an exchange of gun fire will more likely kill your man Busdriver. 
 Cheaper cheeba, cheaper cheeba 
 I think it would be cheaper if I grow your cheeba 
 Hide your beeper, ride a zebra 
 I wonder why you glorify 9 millimeters 
 (Scat) shoot (scat) at revolving doors 
 Wild on the floor, involved in war, or crawling on all fours 
 Gun control! 
 Oh! Goodbye, cruel world! 
 I'll never see my children or my stuff again! 
 (Clack, clack!) 
 Oh! On a scale of 1 to 10 my life was... pretty good. 
 I may be shot in any one of your city or hoods. 
 Hey! 
 Bullets are ricocheting, bouncing off church bells 
 Fools be bailing, all you see is shirt tails 
 But me and my personnel, we got merch' to sell 
 Besides violence and a pacifist don't work well 
 And this has had pouring rain putting out those warring flames 
 Warning shots in the air hit angles and I got blood in my storm drain 
 Sometimes I run over woodland creatures and they become roadkill 
 But still fans stood in the bleachers and come to the Blowed, still 
 But you, you're overkill, you wanna shoot at recordable CD's 
 Like they were clay pigeons, I told you I was babysitting 
 And you thought I came back from a gun fair, but I'm really into child care 
 Cheaper cheeba, cheaper cheeba 
 I think it would be cheaper if I grow your cheeba 
 Hide your beeper, ride a zebra 
 I wonder why you glorify 9 millimeters 
 (Scat) shoot (scat) at revolving doors 
 Wild on the floor, involved in war, or crawling on all fours 
 Gun control! 
 Oh! Goodbye, cruel world! 
 I'll never see my children or my stuff again! 
 (Argh!) 
 On a scale of 1 to 10 my life was a 30 below with a chance of showers 
 But still I had the manpower to sit in front of a mic stand for hours.
