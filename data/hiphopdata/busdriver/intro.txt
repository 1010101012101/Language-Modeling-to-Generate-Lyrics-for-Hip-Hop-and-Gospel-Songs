All the beauty in the world 
 Can't be explained within these words 
 All the pain and anguish can't be contained in a song 
 The unlimited amount of talent and ability 
 Can't be captured in a verse 
 So what we're here to do is to give you a mere hint 
 A mere glimpse into the on-going flow of information 
 And information that retains the personal experiences 
 Cultural programs applied to us and whatnot 
 I'll explain it in my memoirs of the elephant man
