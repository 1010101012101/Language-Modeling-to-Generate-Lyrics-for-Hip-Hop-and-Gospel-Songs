Hey... Hey... Hey 
 You did it, you got it 
 You wowed the world 
 Of casting agents and cowgirls 
 Fess up, you're dressed up to kill yourself 
 Girl, I'm a walking plan-crash to your moms and dads 
 Ostentatious and crass pulling the gauze off your scabs 
 Bitch, I negate the myth of the 'great black boyfriend' 
 In the Polaroid at the get-together 
 Wearing a corduroy vest-sweater 
 So don't get that engagement ring engraved 
 'Cause before we met you thought that hoodrats laid eggs 
 And that rappers were just sky-pirates with peg legs 
 But I kick it with you simply for the shits and giggles, playful innuendos 
 You thought, "he's just an uber-dred for the federal fiscal cap" 
 But after brunch, you'll need 2 Sudafed's and a disco nap 
 After I drain your insides with a crazy straw 
 You ain't my baby doll- "'cause nigga you reek of coffee shop blend" 
 My body's a lollipop that caters to the miss polyglot's whim 
 With addictive agents that outweigh oxycodones 
 And our phobias perfectly fit 
 It takes a quirky chick with curvy hips to petrify this working-stiff 
 You did it, you got it 
 You wowed the world 
 Of casting agents and cowgirls 
 Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself 
 While I'm still on shelf 
 They want an everyman milking the oldest gags 
 Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags 
 They want an everyman milking the oldest gags 
 Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags 
 I'll be today's avatar of the prefab 
 Then end up a child star in rehab 
 It's like a bed-and-breakfast I'm sending a text message on my key pad 
 Saying, "I hav no more to say to my ex-manager (slash) sea hag divorcee 
 Except eat shit and die" 
 My daily commute ends with a fender-bender 
 'Cause no one acknowledges my ten-year tenure 
 I've got the know-how the thrill your scene 
 But they want someone lowbrow, a philistine 
 With iron-on irony for Viacom's white honkies 
 They'll send you a girl wearing tight thongs under nylon gi's 
 "Let's all hit!" 
 But I'm not for the gaudy gangbang 
 The thought of it turns my member to a soggy plantain 
 And shit, I get off on news leads 
 And you eat pet mouse meat, set and poised with sex toys 
 In your penthouse suite believing you're Lou Reed 
 I spit used reeds out the wet mouthpiece 
 Even when sex appeal is taboo, electric bills are past due 
 My head is clear of engineered, election year snafu 
 You did it, you got it 
 You wowed the world 
 Of casting agents and cowgirls 
 Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself 
 While I'm still on shelf 
 They want an everyman milking the oldest gags 
 Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags 
 They want an everyman milking the oldest gags 
 Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags 
 I used to say, fuck it 
 Wouldn't placate the functionaries 
 To busy making playdates with buxom secretaries 
 But I hope that my homies don't laugh, my choreographed dance steps 
 Are a little effeminate for a sociopath 
 We've been airbrushed so much we look like a claymation zoo 
 I'm a voice over on your Playstation 2 
 But in my hey-day my ethical fiber would turn stages into firewood 
 You did it, you got it 
 You wowed the world 
 Of casting agents and cowgirls 
 Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself 
 While I'm still on shelf 
 They want an everyman milking the oldest gags 
 Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flags 
 They want an everyman milking the oldest gags 
 Spilling the contents of a Pepsi can on folded flag
