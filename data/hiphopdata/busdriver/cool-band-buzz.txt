They want to hear good freestyling 
 With sarcasm of Woody Allen 
 Their parents own oil rigs 
 They're just some spoiled kids who I must aim to please 
 And so I'm dipped in a syrup vat 
 And you know this town is a tourist trap 
 Run by entertainment industries and the bureaucrats 
 Selling the ultimate brain freeze 
 This year I'm Sambo, I'm on the Clear Channel 
 I'm smiling and reading my parchment of prose 
 I talk of the common man and of the promised land 
 But I'm insincere and make the Marxists doze 
 My head was a jar of lit bulbs 
 I used to make viewers carsick at shows 
 But now I'm easily the most compromising slut 
 Oh, it's hard to keep this harlot clothed 
 I network and do more than schmooze, I start licking toes 
 Underground rappers smell like garlic cloves 
 But me, I'm smug and decadent 
 Paid obscenely to appear at a set event 
 Companies license my likeliness 
 Money, it heightens my flighty fits 
 I wrote the great American pop song 
 Stylized to my respective tiny niche 
 I wasn't invited to your shindig 
 I've got no plus one and a low slush fund 
 I never expected to ever win big 
 I never expected for you to open my press kit 
 I wasn't invited to your shindig 
 I've got no plus one and a low slush fund 
 I never expected to ever win big 
 I never expected for you to open my press kit 
 The attendance is always subpar 
 When I perform at a club or bar 
 Why did I choose to do weird shit 
 I steered my career off the cliff in a flaming stunt car 
 So now I'm falling down a bottomless pit 
 But I'm trying to be optimistic 
 I spin microwaveable plates, but the label prorates nothing 
 My arms are to cotton pick with 
 Look at the poignant portraits in my doodle sketch 
 Meaning and art exude with every brush stroke 
 But my promises of revolution are futile threats 
 I'm so over sensitive my crotch is blood soaked 
 I'll African dance and cast a voodoo hex 
 While in your dorm spilling all the bong water 
 And count the stars in the nebula until a goggleplex 
 While selling you sticks of nag champa 
 I dumbfound in the coffee shop 
 Looking like Jean-Michel Basquiat 
 And kill gaudy pop with dirty laundry smell 
 Acting all foolhardy leaving kids oddly distraught 
 Gentle laughter when I'm telling jokes at your dead pool party 
 I am a necromancer of an exquisite corpse 
 I'll cry ten minutes in your wet tennis court 
 Because I wasn't invited 
 I wasn't invited to your shindig 
 I've got no plus one and a low slush fund 
 I never expected to ever win big 
 I never expected for you to open my press kit 
 I wasn't invited to your shindig 
 I've got no plus one and a low slush fund 
 I never expected to ever win big 
 I never expected for you to open my press kit 
 They gave all the superfans 
 With notable computer tans 
 Secret decoder rings, plays the older scene 
 With cooler fans
