They paint their vulva beige 
 Bleed a cola keg 
 While I plan to ruin GOP Motar-cades 
 Those senseless 'zines 
 Turned censored scenes 
 I earn a soldier's wage 
 So I broke your legs 
 Threw your rollerblades 
 'Cause you claimed 
 That the OG was overpaid 
 For pointing M-16s 
 At grenadine 
 Coursing through the pollster aid 
 I need my water brunch 
 In the economic crunch 
 The financiers are seeped in a balm and slush 
 An' the sexist machines 
 Express the means 
 To repeal Roe v. Wade 
 So I gotta de-mode the dark matter 
 On the spring loaded park plaza 
 Who is in charge? 
 I don't know 
 They all eat their business cards 
 I'm a hack at deer shootin' 
 Know Vladimir Putin 
 While I wearing this cashmere pants suit thing 
 I can knight the spokesman 
 So Ibuprofen 
 Becomes your golden egg 
 Automated vote ready-tellers 
 Are subsequent heavy sellers 
 In the pool of undecided's registry 
 Because they don't give a fuck 
 About the findings on a troop surge 
 It's a moot point 
 What have you heard? 
 Bumbling idiots for news correspondents 
 See the desperate need for a new foreign policy 
 Yet they give credence to the pro-war pandering 
 As we all squabble for Saturn's rings 
 Regimented doubletalk undercuts the pertinence of 
 Corporate heads tryin' to run away with tax cuts 
 In vestibules the evangelicals are tent poles 
 Beggin the heads of state deregulate the gross 
 Happy ever after benefactors all settle matters 
 The Senate gathers to celebrate the fat fucks 
 Inability to give a single solitary hoot about the 
 Proletariat their merriment is gross 
 What does this mean for you, though? 
 You niggas looking g'd up 
 Rolling in a Prius 
 But I gotta give my money management a C+ 
 With my foreclosed home 
 An' pork bowl loans 
 I re-visit the need to grind 
 I'm dating Russian fem-bots 
 Sipping on some hemlock 
 'Cause I got overdue billings on my desktop 
 When I've been over thought and undercooked 
 That's when I need me-time 
 Me-Time 
 I need some me-time with the 
 Pulmonary Palimpsest 
 Watch the bank merge 
 Liberal thinker 
 Because now the middle finger 
 Is the California state bird 
 If ya ain't heard
