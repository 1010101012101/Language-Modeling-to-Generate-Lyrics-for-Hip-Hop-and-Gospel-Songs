I'll give you everything you'll ever need 
 And I'll find a way to turn you into a monster 
 Me and you, we could rule the world 
 'Cause no one's gonna mess with me, I'm a monster 
 I'll give you everything you'll ever need 
 And I'll find a way to turn you into a monster 
 Me and you, we could rule the world 
 'Cause no one's gonna fuck with me, I'm a monster 
 Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 
 Saw a chick walk in with a big behind 
 Now I'm stalking my victim out 
 Unrecognisable 'cause I'm in disguise 
 Pin blue eyes and her's were green 
 Crept up behind, she turned and screamed 
 Everybody turned to see 
 I tried to run, tripped up and hurt my knee 
 I can't believe that she got away 
 Think of all the love that we could have made 
 I really did mess it up 
 I've ruined my only chance with a sugar babe 
 Now I'm a bit ticked off 
 Back to the flat, hat and kicks off 
 To relax with a glass of milk 
 Apparently pixie drinks lots 
 I'll give you everything you'll ever need 
 And I'll find a way to turn you into a monster 
 Me and you, we could rule the world 
 'Cause no one's gonna mess with me, I'm a monster 
 I'll give you everything you'll ever need 
 And I'll find a way to turn you into a monster 
 Me and you, we could rule the world 
 'Cause no one's gonna fuck with me, I'm a monster 
 No so, so shit 
 Not for me, not pro, no me my flows so piff 
 Quasimodo with addicted to both my legs 
 It looks like a pogo stick 
 Admitted I am a fruit loop 
 Frankenstein with a screw loose 
 In search of a new neck bolt 
 How long will this neck hold? 
 I'll be fine with a needle and thread 
 A lil' Jack and I'm evil again 
 Scheming again 
 Introduce me to any one decent, I'll find evil in them 
 Everybody's PC I don't feel them 
 If I could, I would kill them 
 Before I go I'd like to thank Peter Andre 
 For looking after my children 
 There ain't a line I ain't took far 
 To find me you ain't even gotta look hard 
 Don't get it confused, I'm a crook star 
 Puber I was born with a moustache 
 There ain't a line I ain't took far 
 To find me you ain't even gotta look hard 
 Don't get it confused, I'm a crook star 
 Puber I was born with a moustache 
 Monster, monster, monster 
 Monster, monster, monster, monster 
 I'm a monster, monster, monster 
 Monster, monster, monster, monster 
 I'll give you everything you'll ever need 
 And I'll find a way to turn you into a monster 
 Me and you, we could rule the world 
 'Cause no one's gonna mess with me, I'm a monster 
 I'll give you everything you'll ever need 
 And I'll find a way to turn you into a monster 
 Me and you, we could rule the world 
 'Cause no one's gonna fuck with me, I'm a monster 
 Sorry Pete
