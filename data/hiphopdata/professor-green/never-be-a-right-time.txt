(Verse One) 
 This is stressing me, 
 It's really beginning to get to me, 
 You've always been the best to me, 
 An I've never given you any less of me, 
 You never been in a negative energy, 
 Stressing, you tell me never to let it get to me, 
 There's never been another next to me, 
 That means what you meant to me, 
 I said meant but that's mean, 
 I meant mean to me, 
 Not meant to me, 
 But I don't know if it's meant to be, 
 I wanna tell you but nothing's coming out when I speak, 
 I can't find the words to say, 
 It's like the words evade me, 
 Struggling to find a way to word it, 
 And I'm suppose to be a word-smith, 
 It's as hard to find the words to say, 
 It's hard to find the words to say... 
 They'll never be a right time, 
 The time will never be right, 
 They'll never be a right time, 
 For me to tell you, 
 It's over... 
 (Verse Two) 
 I was selling white, 
 You was telling me I could do better, 
 I told you if I was you I'd leave, 
 But you never, forever had faith in me, 
 Even when I never did, 
 I'd said I'd never let her slip like her ex fella did, 
 Been trying to disguise and dress it up, 
 I wanna tell her but I can't bare to see her welling up, 
 I gotta find the strength to let her know, 
 I gotta find the strength to let her go, 
 But I know if I let her go, 
 I'll never know if things'll get better with her, 
 See this could be a hiccup and not the end of the road, 
 I'd do better to never get involved, 
 She deserves better, 
 Than a fella with a fear of being alone, 
 Struggling to find a way to word it, 
 And I'm suppose to be a word-smith, 
 It's as hard to find the words to say, 
 It's hard to find the words to say... 
 They'll never be a right time, 
 The time will never be right, 
 They'll never be a right time, 
 For me to tell you, 
 It's over... 
 I can't help the way I fell, 
 I don't want us to end, 
 But I can't help the I feel, 
 I really can't pretend, 
 No, I can't help the way I feel, 
 But I don't want us to end, 
 Cause it would never be enough for us to just be friends... 
 (Verse Three) 
 Nah, it would never be enough, 
 So I think we both know what it means for us, 
 I see the look on your face and I hate it, 
 But I finally pluck enough courage to say it, 
 That's when she spins me around and tells me I ain't never leaving, 
 To tell her I take it back and tell her I don't mean it, 
 To look her dead in the eye and tell her I don't feel it, 
 But I don't feel it... 
 They'll never be a right time, 
 The time will never be right, 
 They'll never be a right time, 
 For me to tell you, 
 It's over...
