How many moons, how many mornings 
 How many moons, how many mornings 
 Have I got left 'til I've no breath left to breathe? 
 How long's left for me, whatever the time, for the rest of mine 
 I'm gonna spend time putting an end to my 
 Enemies who wanna put an end to my shine 
 Why bother try offending me? It's off with the heads of these swines 
 When I sign out you're gonna remember me 
 Remember me? Don't nobody wanna send for me 
 The only time they mention me 
 Or speak of me disrespectfully is when they sleep 
 I've been between a lot of legs of a body of a centipede 
 Please, enemies, be more courteous 
 Save me the sweat and forget to breathe 
 Life could be easier, I could ease it up breathe 
 Instead I look like someone trying to squeeze a dump 
 And I ain't eating in months so I need these MC's on the edge 
 I'll be the reason they jump off 
 Remember the jump off when I come forth 
 You don't wanna be the MC I run towards 
 I like Miley, I like her straight, I ain't no Dumbledore 
 Untoward, too stressed like I love and adore you 
 But its custom I come before you and it's cool if I can't get it up 
 'Cause I've got a cucumber for you 
 Fuck the world, I'ma stick it in mud stingy 
 Wanna drink? You can piss in a cup, I leave women as livid as stunts 
 So run your lips, I've been itching to give a chick a bit of a cunt, punt 
 How many moons 
 (How many moons) 
 How many mornings 
 (Have I got left 'til I've no breath left to breathe?) 
 How many moons

 (Have I got left?) 
 Have I got left 'til I've no breath left to breathe 
 How long's left for me, whatever the time, for the rest of mine 
 I'm gonna spend time putting an end to my 
 Enemies who wanna put an end to my shine 
 Why bother try offending me? It's off with the heads of these swines 
 When I sign out you're gonna remember me 
 Sanity, I squandered it, I think I've gone a bit too far 
 In darkness I'm wondering guess his bitch, he ain't on the list 
 Well, I'm pissed off, I'm not at top of it 
 Deep in thought conspiring, getting the firing 
 Call my thought a firing frime and twiddling thumbs 
 I'm hating the world's smallest violin 
 Inconsiderate like I give a fuck how they feel 
 Kidnapping rappers and having them as microwave meals 
 I know my meals ready when the microwave stops 
 I'm a lot more Jack Nicholson than I am Michael J Fox 
 The creep that crept up on daisy low in the baby grow 
 I sat on her knee and told her to touch me inappropriately 
 Until my daisy grows 
 I'm not a man of her mankind, mechanical mad man 
 I make Hannibal look more like Annabelle, I'm an animal right now
