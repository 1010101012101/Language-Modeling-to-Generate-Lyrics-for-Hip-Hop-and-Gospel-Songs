 I don't know what that means but I know it flows sick 
 Oh shit, there I go being a dick again 
 Look at me, I can say the longest word in the dictionary 
 I don't know much but I know 
 The future's bright, the future's green 
 The future's me, the future's I 
 Maybe you'd understand me a little better if you were high 
 Do you like my DJ I-I-I-IQ? 
 Make no mistake I'm just as high-igh-igh too 
 If you say the wrong thing about me 
 Your career is something that you can say goodbye, bye, bye to 
 How's your album doing? Mine flew 
 This time around I'm doing what I did on the last one times two 
 An some, Damn son have you seen the state of your eyeballs? 
 Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off 
 Till we stop there will be no falling, no we're giving everything we've got 
 'TIl the wheels fall off we'll be rolling, yeah we go anywhere we want 
 La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
 Me, I attract beef 
 I eat tracks, that's me 
 Jack D, Hackney 
 It's in my blood, and we 
 Act silly to the phone 
 Taxi and I'm home 
 Bad B, black sheep 
 Bag of beans and an O 
 Yo, I'm getting high tonight 
 Where women who make do getting by tonight 
 I like the life, but I ain't into courting 
 I'm only into spooning if it leads to forking 
 I'm back buzzin' 
 I'd shag Eva Mendez even if she was my damn cousin 
 So please don't, please don't think I am lonely 
 Even though I'm swimming in women for the pussy I'm in 
 I ain't tryina catch nothing 
 I ain't lighetning up, I'm still as mean 
 Still as drunk, still as high 
 Still as lean, still as Green 
 Stood still on a pair of stilts in a distillery 
 The last time I got head it involved the guillotine 
 Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off 
 Till we stop there will be no falling, no we're giving everything we've got 
 'TIl the wheels fall off we'll be rolling, yeah we go anywhere we want 
 La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
 I don't know what it is man 
 But something about this beat just kinda makes me feel 
 Invincible... 
 Like I can do anything I want without any question 
 I might even cover my naked body in sticky tape and run through All Saints 
 And come out doing my JLS impression 
 Hehehehe 
 Don't Piss Me Off! (Don't Piss Me Off) 
 Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off 
 Don't piss me, don't piss me, don't piss me off 
 Till we stop there will be no falling, no we're giving everything we've got 
 'TIl the wheels fall off we'll be rolling, yeah we go anywhere we want 
 Don't Piss Me Off!
