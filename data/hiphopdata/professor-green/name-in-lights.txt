People always ask me how I write songs 
 I tell them it's not complicated 
 I quite simply take everything one line at a time 
 Listen 
 Everybody knows what my name is 
 But I'm still out pulling faces 
 Cara Delevingne have you got any cocaine please 
 Night out, 'cause it's my night off 
 I need a day off 'cause when I crash I'll be a write-off 
 What a fucking sight, fuck it what a fucking night 
 Who the fuck are you to tell me how to live my fucking life?! 
 Loving life, me I'm dandy 
 How quick can you get rid of a bottle of brandy? 
 In a rave listening to Trinidad James 
 Though we don't pop mollies we drop bombs of mandy 
 I go in if I'm out but I'm in a pickle now 
 I think Shop put something in my drink 
 And before I got back from the pissery fizzled out 
 Damned it didn't I. Down dizzled up 
 Fuck, what if I get pictured out!? 
 'Cause I'm shameless, young and I'm famous 
 I'm shameless, young and I'm dangerous 
 I'm shameless, young and outrageous 
 They never should have put my name in lights 
 Rizzle Kicks: 
 Aww you get famous and then you seem naughty 
 Look at Stephen and he's like 40 
 Yo, got a little buzz, now it's funny 
 Cause the hunnies make a b-line for me 
 Tunnel ends with a bright light 
 But I'm alive and every tunnel I find's got a white line 
 "Keep running to the loos" magazines chatter 
 Ain't substance abuse, I got a weak bladder! 
 Call it the Bieber effect; young too silly 
 Pro's pissed and in a year I'll have a few millis 
 Woop diddy, now they callin me an influence 
 They might as well say that Eddie Murphy is impotent 
 I told my label I'm not a pisshead, I'm vibrant 
 And I only drink to make celebs more exciting 
 You should try this cause no one's really saying much 
 Until they roll the Queen's face into a cylinder 
 Another one sniffs the dust! 
 'Cause I'm shameless, young and I'm famous 
 I'm shameless, young and I'm dangerous 
 I'm shameless, young and outrageous 
 They never should have put my name in lights 
 Put my name in lights 
 Creatures of the night 
 Now my mind is rolling 
 My eyes wide open 
 Fall down on the table 
 I'm crazy and I'm feeling quite unstable 
 My head spins, feeling reckless 
 I should probably slow right down 
 But I'm too tempted 
 Professor Green 
 I'm a bastard, yep 
 My mother had me before she and my father had married 
 I'm a bastard and I'm plastered 
 My God, honestly what have I started 
 Why is my face on pages of papers that I wouldn't even wipe my arse with 
 Why are they so nasty to me? 
 I think I preferred it when they arse kissed 
 Oh and Cara I'm sorry Cara 
 But I can't promise I won't take this any farther! 
 'Cause I'm shameless, young and I'm famous 
 I'm shameless, young and I'm dangerous 
 I'm shameless, young and outrageous 
 They never should have put my name in lights 
 Put my name in lights 
 Creatures of the night 
 Now my mind is rolling 
 My eyes wide open
