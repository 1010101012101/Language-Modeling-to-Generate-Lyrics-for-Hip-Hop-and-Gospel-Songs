And I'm drunk and I'm blown 
 And I don't know what I'ma do 
 Got it cocked, ready loaded 
 And I'm lookin' for you 
 In your nightmare, I'll be right there 
 Yeah, uh, you ain't even in a realm we spit 
 Nightmares spent too, Freddy Krueger pencil on my Elm Street shit 
 Believe none of what you see, none of this shit you've heard 
 I call rollin' a blunt of herb turnin' over a new leaf 
 A mixture of Biggie and Pac goin' upside your head 
 With a mic stand at your show, it's me givin' you props 
 My mind's pure, I thank Kobe, I game till the bank's broke 
 And my flow's as overcame as Frank Ocean 
 It ain't a thing to hang a ling, night tears by day 
 Nightmares of the night like dang to dang 
 It's six million ways to end your life 
 And I chose the tool over the bloody club with the finger knives 
 I'm who you can't stand, probably leanin' 
 You probably dreamin' 'bout Mr. Sandman 
 Mixed with up with Robert England 
 Me, I put it right there to see, how could I ever have a bad dream 
 When the nightmare's me? Nickel 
 And I'm drunk and I'm blown 
 And I don't know what I'ma do 
 Got it cocked, ready loaded 
 And I'm lookin' for you 
 In your nightmare, I'll be right there 
 Everythin' in life comes at a price 
 It's time for you to pay 
 My pen is my paintbrush, I'm forever takin' it farther and further 
 God forbid that I ever extend my arm to murder 
 You don't wanna see me in these Shih-Tzu's in a pen, I'm a pit-bull 
 The world needs a new Fritzl, doesn't it? 
 I ain't thinkin' about pistols, fuck a stick 
 I'm more interested in doin' some other shit 
 Plannin' shit out and really havin' some fun with it 
 Disintegratin' your body instead of dumpin' it 
 I don't care how uncomfortable your cupboard is 
 I'll be up in it until I hear your front door openin', you're comin' in 
 Till it's time to get to work with the screws 
 And all the other tools that I come here with 
 Yeah, I'm fuckin' sick in the head, should I operate in silence? 
 Or pick a cassette to drown out the screams as the blade tickles your flesh 
 I can hear the heart in your chest beat as you plead to me 
 Until I cut your tongue out when I'm sick of hearin' you beg 
 Should have quit while ahead, you little fuck 
 You think a little blood is punishment? 
 Enough for all the things that you said? 
 Just as the blade I picked to finish you hit your neck 
 You wake up shiverin' in your bed 
 Yeah, I'm a nightmare 
 And I'm drunk and I'm blown 
 And I don't know what I'ma do 
 Got it cocked, ready loaded 
 And I'm lookin' for you 
 In your nightmare, I'll be right there 
 Nightmares 
 Nightmares 
 Nightmares
