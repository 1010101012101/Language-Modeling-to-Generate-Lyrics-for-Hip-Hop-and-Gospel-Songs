It's time to even it up. 
 I guess a round table weren't equal enough. 
 You can't contain me with chains, I'm free and I run free. 
 Any enemy is coming with me when I'm done. 
 Whatever's asked of me, I have performed. 
 I rid through rain into the eye of the storm. 
 Still carrying the flame, I have the torch. 
 Failure comes at a price, I can't afford. 
 Never been half hearted, I put my all in. 
 Forfeited all just to answer my calling. 
 Wearing the scars of the wars that I've fought in. 
 I should have been heading for the stars but I'm falling. 
 I have your sword and cape. 
 If you need them, I'll be swimming in the lake. 
 Ooh baby, don't look down. 
 Just take the crown. 
 We'll be kings forever. 
 Ooh-whoa! 
 Holding on together. 
 Ooh-whoa! 
 Feeling so much better. 
 Ooh-whoa! 
 When everything was wrong. 
 And everything was gone. 
 We ran to avalon. 
 I fought till I had no fight left. 
 Risked my death, walked with conviction in every one of my steps. 
 My strength's water enough to wash away any of the stains on my rep. 
 Yeah, I fought off vultures, went against odds. 
 When I was short on soldiers, I asked not for my burden to be lightened. 
 But if I may have broader shoulders. 
 So as I may carry the weight, all the doubt I had in me has been allayed. 
 So from now until the day that I'm carried away. 
 I will never walk around what stands in my way. 
 If they ain't letting up cause neither will I. 
 When I die, from the ashes an eagle will rise. 
 Long as my blade and my faith'll keep me alive. 
 Fear ain't something that you will see in my eyes. 
 We'll be kings forever. 
 Ooh-whoa! 
 Holding on together. 
 Ooh-whoa! 
 Feeling so much better. 
 Ooh-whoa! 
 When everything was wrong. 
 And everything was gone. 
 We ran to avalon. 
 We ran to avalon. 
 I left the competition out for the count, no abacus. 
 Fought for the crown, thwart thy challengers. 
 When my massacre was ordained, I remained. 
 And through pain forged my sword. 
 I left the competition out for the count, no abacus. 
 Fought for the crown, thwart thy challengers. 
 When my massacre was ordained, I remained. 
 And through pain forged my sword, my excalibur. 
 We'll be kings forever. 
 Ooh-whoa! 
 Holding on together. 
 Ooh-whoa! 
 Feeling so much better. 
 Ooh-whoa! 
 When everything was wrong. 
 And everything was gone. 
 We ran to avalon.
