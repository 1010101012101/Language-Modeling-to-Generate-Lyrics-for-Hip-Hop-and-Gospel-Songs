Professor green: 
 I can't handle my drugs, 
 So blame Sha and his hand for the buds, 
 Before these vocals I was tee total till the AK, 
 Now I'm back and I'm buzzed 
 Get funky, light one up 
 Get skunky, so toast to, me! 
 Toast to green, 
 About to take hold and take over the scene. 
 Or maybe that should be ether it? 
 Either way I ain't an idiot. 
 I did quit smoking weed, but didn't stop me eating it! 
 P's raw, and I been poor, 
 So I could never get enough p I need more. 
 See-saw there's 5 saturdays, 
 And I won't be happy till I've at least hit 4 
 Emeli sande: (chorus) 
 It's a long day when your rolling and rocking, 
 And the spin isn't stopping 
 When you don't care where you are 
 It's the wrong day 
 If your looking for sober 
 You can find him hung over for the kids who love to dance. 
 Professor green: 
 The professor of rhymes, 
 Mr dexter met lecter and had one hell of a time 
 A devil disguised, lies! 
 You can tell that I'm high by my festival eyes. 
 Festival eyes? ain't it a Monday? 
 Fuck knows! may as well be a Sunday. 
 Run away when I take off 6 val's 
 Whoops... straight lose six hours. 
 I'm back in effect, 
 Got shanked in my neck now I'm back from the dead. 
 But adjusting has been hard, 
 Like I give a shit man chicks dig scars. 
 Chicks dig me so I dig 'em out, 
 But I keep 'em all, never let them out. 
 Got sixteen in my cellar now, 
 Yeah I still take bus but I get about. 
 Emeli sande: (chorus) 
 It's a long day when your rolling and rocking, 
 And the spin isn't stopping 
 When you don't care where you are 
 It's the wrong day 
 If your looking for sober 
 You can find him hung over for the kids who love to dance. 
 Love to dance (x2) 
 We're the kids that love to dance. 
 Professor green: 
 The bad boy's back boy, 
 On the road with my ipood on singing along to black boys. 
 Then skipping along to take that, 
 So take that say what? 
 I hate rap! 
 Haha... ain't that funny? 
 Shitting on rappers like I ate that curry. 
 So? so mind your business. 
 Or wind up with stitches, bitches! 
 Dickless with yoour wanna-be bars, 
 Impotant rappers - all wanna be hard. 
 Diss me? you must wanna get parred! 
 Faux-par your so 'barge. 
 Ain't seen a rapper like me yet so far! 
 Nah, I'm gunna take getting used to, 
 The pupil nobody coould get through to, 
 On youtube, in a tutu. 
 Emeli sande: (chorus) 
 It's a long day when your rolling and rocking, 
 And the spin isn't stopping 
 When you don't care where you are 
 It's the wrong day

 Love to dance (x2) 
 We're the kids that love to dance.
