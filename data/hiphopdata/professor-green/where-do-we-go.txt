Remember when it started I tried to hold back, 
 Didn't wanna get too into it nor get too intimate, 
 Tried to back off, but that back-off, 
 She's gorgeous, 5 ft 4 and 3 quarters, 
 Half Italian half Japanese, she can make cars crash in them jeans, 
 But she's so much more than a body, she's perfect, 
 I knew it would hurt but it was worth it, 'cause when it was working 
 Weren't nothing like it and to be honest it's as in love that I've been ever! 
 I never felt a love like this before, so is it I feel so insecure, 
 Fuck it I'm taking her dive, no more linking I'm making her mine but 
 Where do we go, where do we go, where do we go from here. 
 Where do we go, where do we go, where do we go from here. 
 It's been a couple of months, we've grown so tight so quick, 
 I just might let you in see, I'm quite closed off, 
 I got alot of pain inside, that's why I get high till I dose off but, 
 I change in time atleast I hope to, cause it feels so right when I hold you, 
 I wanna get inside I wanna know you, there's so much of i, I wanna show you 
 And though I'm scared to, I'm prepared to, trust you as long as you share too. 
 Lucked up, both loved up, but little did we know we were both fucked up 
 The more open we were the more vulnerable, but after a while werent fun at all 
 It got deep and procided to change, I needed you and you needed the space 
 What a waste. 
 Where do we go, where do we go, where do we go from here. 
 Where do we go, where do we go, where do we go from here.
