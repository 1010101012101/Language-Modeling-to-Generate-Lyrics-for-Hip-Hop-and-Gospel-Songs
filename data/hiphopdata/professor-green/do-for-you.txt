There ain't much I ain't been through, I used to sell drugs for a living. 
 And even though I changed my career, I'm still stuck where I'm living. 
 And certain man are livid, don't wanna see the progression. 
 See the professor and want to teach him a lesson. 
 They wanna strip me, the girls wanna see me naked. 
 I flow hot but they don't wanna see me make it. 
 It gets deep on these old streets, always gotta worry about my old beefs. 
 Same way I still dance through the bits, jeans sagging with half of the piff. 
 You wanna see me down, if only you could see me now, toe to toe. 
 Lets go I got no fears, just know that I'll be here when the smoke clears. 
 What can you do to me, that I can't do to you? 
 What do you want me to, do for you? 
 What can you do to me, that I can't do for you? 
 What do you want me to, do for you? 
 I am completely confused and somewhat confused by the fact, 
 That anything you think you could do or have done to me, that I couldn't do back. 
 Eye for an eye, shot for a shot, you might have, but I have not forgotten where I am from fam'. 
 Certain man are telling too much lies, took a shank 'cause I got too much pride, 
 Rather than kick though, it was a bit close, lucky me I'm still alive to get dough, though.

 I, I see a look in your eyes, I've seen before, telling me love don't live no more. 
 I, I see there's a thin line between love and hate and once you've crossed it it's too late to come back. 
 A few people'd tell you that I ain't shit, still mistaking their jealousy for hatred. 
 I wonder if it would of changed if it wasn't for the game, either way I wouldn't change shit. 
 Might give a little but I take none, I am the difference, I ain't trying to make one. 
 Suck out, you think I give a fuck 'bout when any a these pricks run their mouth? 
 Your speech long, say what you like but take it as a fuck you when I don't respond. 
 So passed, I'm beyond, so lickle man be gone. For your playing havoc with my ambience. 
 You wanna see me down, if only you could see me now, toe to toe. 
 Lets go I got no fears, just know that I'll be here when the smoke clears.
