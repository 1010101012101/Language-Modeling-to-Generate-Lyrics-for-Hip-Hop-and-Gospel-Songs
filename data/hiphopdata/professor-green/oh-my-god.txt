Oh whoa oh ooh x 4 
 Are you ready for the revolution 
 My elocution is execution I am a electrocuted 
 What the hell am I doing up no idea 
 But catch a wiff of my fingers 
 And you can still smell susan 
 Smell like a ashtray breath stinking of liquor 
 Pocket full of change and yesterdays get up 
 Same jeans that I had the day before 
 Laaaaa 
 Guess I'm raps george best with a lot more cess 
 A little more liquor and alot more sex 
 Sometimes we take it too far 
 Knocked out, sick on my guitar 
 And I hear them say 
 Oh my god, say oh my god, say oh my got 
 Lay my head down on the bar 
 Cause wiskey never taste good 
 When I hear them say 
 Oh my god, say oh my god, say oh my god. 
 The first look you make me shiver, sipper 
 K, picking at yesterdays dinner plate 
 The way I say things it figures I'm Paige thicker 
 When I thing says spitters make her say uh 
 Get insain and wanna get in my way picker 
 Day when you wanna get with a rated star 
 Diss me not (I'm frisky) what 
 Still itching to get me cock in pixie lott 
 Just call me raps george best with a lot more cess 
 A little more liquor and alot more sex 
 Sometimes we take it too far 
 Knocked out, sick on my guitar 
 And I hear them say 
 Oh my god, say oh my god, say oh my got 
 Lay my head down on the bar 
 Cause wiskey never taste good 
 When I hear them say 
 Oh my god, say oh my god, say oh my god. 
 I do drugs 'cause I like the buzz 
 Go sleep wake up feeling like I tried to fight a bus 
 Bearly functioning alcoholic 
 Liveing life like a student but with a pop stars walllet 
 Always smiling with my new teeth 
 Two e's two cubes rules two 2ps
