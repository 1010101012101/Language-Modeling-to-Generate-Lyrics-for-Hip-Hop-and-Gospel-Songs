My mind I'm out of it 
 Got a bottle of jack time to drown in it 
 I made it here but don't know how I did 
 Who'd of thought this year man the shit I been 
 Through with the man to this, how about a spliff 
 I feel like I'm spinning out, it's kind of surreal 
 All of the shit I been around, now months sinse I 
 Licked a nans out shit just switched to rhymes 
 I still can't figure out how 
 With your feet in the air and your head on the ground 
 Let's try this trick, spinning 
 Your head will collapse, there's nothing whether to ask yourself, where is 
 My mind, my mind, my mind 
 Way out in the water seeing swimming 
 My lifes a rollercoaster, a fucking hurricane 
 Got a past which I wouldn't wanna tuck away 
 There were minutes were I wish you could'a run away 
 But I stay stuffer till I live to see another day 
 And look how quick it changed up, it's insane blood 
 Fuck the fame I'm still the same as when I came up 
 But now I get paid get laid quicker, drink straight 
 And make a face like I hate liquor 
 I had a lot to prove, I had to shop with lu 
 My nan turns the TV on and on the tune 
 Summer time with lill and were on the yacht with muse 
 If you can see the gap between the from and the to 
 It's crazy 
 With your feet in the air and your head on the ground 
 Let's try this trick, spinning 
 Your head will collapse, there's nothing whether to ask yourself, where is 
 My mind, my mind, my mind 
 Way out in the water seeing swimming 
 Where is my mind 
 Where is my mind 
 Where is my mind 
 Way out in the water seeing swimming
