Lily Allen: 
 Friends, tell me I am crazy 
 That I'm wasting time with you 
 You'll never be mine 
 Just be good to me 
 Professor Green: 
 Ha, Just be good to green 
 All I need is a woman to be good to me 
 I'm an easy man, I'm easily pleased 
 An you provide me with everything that I need 
 Look you know I make ends I grind 
 So hold onto yours we're spending mine 
 Though you try I never let you buy 
 But If I was broke would you still be spending time? 
 [Lily Allen:] Yes 
 An I believe you would 
 Don't think p's to fucked to treat you good 
 I walk street with you, talk deep with you 
 Even slip an spend all week with you 
 Then I'm off, you wish I'd put an end to the torment 
 Stop, but one thing it's not ever is boring 
 What would you rather me be like? 
 I ain't ever gonna change are you ever gonna realise? 
 [Lily Allen:] Always talk about 
 [Professor Green:] Look, people are always gonna talk babes, 
 [Lily Allen:] Reputation 
 [Professor Green:] I ain't even gonna lie 
 Shit, but it ain't like you don't know what mine is 
 [Lily Allen:] I don't care what you do to them 
 [Professor Green:] Nah 
 [Lily Allen:] Just be good to me 
 [Professor Green:] I'll try, an try, an try 
 Professor Green: 
 Look babes, you know who I am 
 But as crooked as I am 
 I'll be as good as I can 
 I try an try though it's evident my 
 Angel face is disguise for the devil inside 
 You're good to me, I ain't good to girls, ME? 
 I'm a bad boy something every good girl needs, heh 
 Honesty could avoid all your tantrums 
 But I'm a naughty boy and I always have been 
 WHAT 
 An that ain't changing any time soon 
 I can't have you with me whenever I move 
 Whatever I do, I come back to you, 
 See the good attracts me and the crook attracts you 
 [Lily Allen:] Whatever 
 [Professor Green:] What 
 We've all got our ways 
 Remember us talking? 
 Of course it was game 
 But it's all gone an changed 
 Now she's got me cutting of links like I'm trying to shorten my chain 
 [Lily Allen:] Always talk about 
 [Professor Green:] Look, people are always gonna talk babes, 
 [Lily Allen:] Reputation 
 [Professor Green:] I ain't even gonna lie 
 Shit, but it ain't like you don't know what mine is 
 [Lily Allen:] I don't care what you do to them
