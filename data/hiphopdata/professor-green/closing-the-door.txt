I don't mean to be ungrateful and I could never tell you something if it ain't true. 
 I'm stable, and I find its easier for me being single than it is being faithful. 
 I got somewhere I gotta be and I can't take you, and you deserve more so why would you make do? 
 I ain't no angel and there ain't nothing you could say to me to save us cause it ain't you. 
 I'll hold onto everything we went through, I'll always remember what you meant to me. 
 Now there's business I got to attend to, the money for nothing and the drinks are free 
 Where I'm going, there's no place for all the little things we kinda got a taste for. 
 But you know there's a lot I'm gonna miss, there ain't a page long enough for me to write a list. 
 Is this as good as it gets? Is this situation gonna turn into one of life's regrets? 
 Is this as good as it gets, is this situation gonna turn into one of life's regrets? 
 This is how it goes, everything around me so full of possible, 
 Close the door behind me, start thinking 'bout what's in front of me Ooh 
 I don't mean to be ungrateful and I could never tell you something if it ain't true. 
 I'm stable, and I find its easier for me being single than it is being faithful. 
 I ain't alone 'cause I know you've got needs too, and from a distance its nothing I can see to. 
 I'd rather leave you, than insult you with the lies, 'cause I'm really not as sly as to deceive you. 
 Time for us both is so precious, selfish is never what I meant to be. 
 In a business where sin is relentless and nobody sees nothing in the VIP, I don't know if it's a place I was meant for, or if its everything I always ever dreamt for. 
 But I know there's a lot I am going to miss, there ain't a page long enough for me to write a list. 
 Is this as good as it gets? Is this situation gonna turn into one of life's regrets? 
 Is this as good as it gets, is this situation gonna turn into one of life's regrets? 
 This is how it goes, everything around me so full of possible, 
 Close the door behind me, start thinking 'bout what's in front of me Ooh 
 Only time will tell if I'm doing the right thing, see honesty's all about the timing, its frightening but I'm trying to make it easier for you by closing the door behind me.
