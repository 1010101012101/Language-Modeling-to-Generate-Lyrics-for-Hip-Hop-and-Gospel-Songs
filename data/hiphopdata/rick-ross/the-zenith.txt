Boy, I'm shinning on these hoes 
 Triple gold Daytons when I'm riding on these hoes 
 Got that leather and wood 
 You know how that story goes 
 I'm always on my toes when I ain't pushing a wheel 
 Tires screech and squeal as I bend it to the top 
 All these haters sit and watch my climb wishing that it stop 
 I got a crown on my wrist and a crown on my top 
 And I got it on alone now they crowding my spot, man 
 Is this the game that I chose? 
 Nobody gave me ish so it's nobody I owe 
 I got that Lee-Roy glow 
 Soul of an assassin and I'm trying to have me backed in 
 Off up in that corner but I'm off up in this bitch 
 Gold dangling all over 
 This W tat sweater and it's double M G 
 I ain't gonna be slept on forever 
 Tell the Sandman to wake 'em up and help me count this cheddar 
 Not enough hands on me 
 Eyes on the sparrow and I'm laid up like a pharaoh 
 Got a couple grand on me, I'm just living my life 
 They said I would change, I'm just proving 'em right 
 I was broke before, so I'll be broke some more 
 Man, that don't sound right 
 But what it sound like is a good year for me 
 I used to look at the future and I couldn't bear to see 
 Me, my momma, and my sister was the bears in the tree 
 Porridge in my bowl, trying to keep hold of my souls 
 Now I'm the big man to beat 
 It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree 
 When you start shaking that tree 
 It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree 
 Look at me 
 My back is to the wind, and I just want to win 
 But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing 
 Nothing, nothing 
 Looking at the sky, pray that I survive 
 Self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing 
 Nothing, nothing 
 Gold Rollie, most hoes want to know me 
 Blowing OG, I never socialize with police 
 Glock 40, never had it, why I'mma need it? 
 It'll be them niggas that's looking for it mama'll be grieving 
 I ain't thugging, who the fuck is you mean-mugging? 
 I seen the meanest and toughest niggas Speedy Gonzales 
 Don't obsess over money, I'm just eager for comfort 
 Don't obsess over fame, I just speak to the public 
 Ain't reached my zenith, but all the people see that I'm buzzing 
 Shout outs Seattle, but these rappers, they stealing my thunder 
 Lost a lot of homies, none of 'em even died 
 I see 'em all the time, but jealousy is sabotage 
 Riding in another drop, ain't talking Enterprise 
 They try to see me, get diabetes from humble pie 
 Yeah, I hate to lose more than they love to win 
 That's the difference 'tween me and them 
 My back is to the wind, and I just want to win 
 But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing 
 Nothing, nothing 
 Looking at the sky, pray that I survive 
 Self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing 
 Nothing, nothing 
 I wake up in the morning, roll up my marijuana 
 Thinking 'bout tomorrow, I don't want to be a martyr 
 Stress that I be under, blame that on my baby momma 
 Pills that I be popping, wonder will they take me under? 
 Rush to Mac 11 for these ho niggas with drama 
 Success in my possession, had you murdered out of karma 
 All these niggas snitching, witness perjury, Your Honor 
 Handle my business, tuition for my kids' college 
 Dope boy styling, DEA target 
 One point seven for these VS's on my collar 
 Born in the projects, now I'm known as the hottest 
 Lay your whole label down, bitch I came for the dollars 
 My back is to the wind, and I just want to win 
 But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing 
 Nothing, nothing 
 Looking at the sky, pray that I survive 
 Self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing 
 Nothing, nothing
