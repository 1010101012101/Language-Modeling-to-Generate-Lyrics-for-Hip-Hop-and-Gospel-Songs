I'm fresh from my head to feet (to my feet) 
 737 get like me (like me) 
 So fly but we keep it so street (so street) 
 Check my swag and do it like me 
 Yeah I'm flyer than the best of them 
 Fresher than the rest of them 
 737 bitch, that's the new testament 
 Picture perfect specimen of pimpin' in the flesh 
 I make top down music or chrom just to flex a bit 
 Debonaire veteran, know your tired of peddlin' 
 With petty rappers who say they're trappers with no medicine 
 Plus I'm riding better than, half of them who swear by that 
 Know that I'm a client but I'm still the player-president 
 Lavish is the residence 
 Plus I fuck with Meryll-Lynch 
 Hotter than a kettle bitch and I got presidence 
 Over lames who claim they on some better shit 
 Bitch niggaz delicate, been the shit ever since 1983 
 80's baby and I'm hellarich, ridin' while I text your bitch 
 Tell her she's my favorite, let her suck me out 
 She like vanilla berry flavor dick 
 Jiggolo I'm heaven sent, niggaz hate to use it 
 Man I'm on the scene with a polo and jeans that's so clean 
 You should see the way your bitch neck lean when I'm gleamin' 
 Niggaz say they fly but they don't understand the meanin' 
 Suave House, we been here we not leavin' 
 Jiggolo I'm cool but look see these heathens 
 That bust a nigga head on sight no more breathin' 
 Just give them a reason to click and then clack 
 Don't try 'em they been to jail and they dyin' to go back 
 You ain't 737 cause you got a lil' beamer 
 Pockets on beast buy you earn a lil' leaner 
 Man up a squad pimp you better get your team up 
 Flood you like Katrina, you gonna need FEMA 
 A great imagination but an even better dreamer 
 To think you try to see us, it's best you try to be us 
 To go to war you'll probably need Jesus 
 Please believe us we will not ease up 
 See I used to be modest about it but they doubters 
 So I put it in their face and let them see that I'm about it 
 You wanna shine like me but your cues too clouded 
 These VVS's got my charms so crowded 
 If you could only see all this money that I've counted 
 Came a long way from pushin' carts in Thomas County 
 Now they crowd around me, tell me I'm that new nigga 
 From Phoenix to Mississippi, I'm down to talent nigga 
 No need for a hint of febreeze 
 My feces is so easy on the nose, it's like berry and roses 
 For those of you that's slow, my shit got no odor 
 Flip her like yoga, fuck her and then show her 
 To the door cause, I'm on a dough hunt 
 I'm runnin' circles bout this paper call me dough nuts 
 And this is no luck, I'm in the fore front 
 'Cause I'm the shit, fuckin' dirty roll the dro up 
 (Chorus till Close)
