 Whoo (woo, woo, woo) 
 Maybach music... boss 
 Maybach music... ricky ross 
 MAYBACH MUSIC... ITS TRIPPLE C's 
 Maybach music... color cut clariy 
 My gun dirty, my brick clean 
 I'm ridding dirty, my dick clean 
 She talk dirty but her mouth clean 
 Bitch I'm MC hammer... I'm about cream 
 I got 30 cars, hole lot of dancers 
 I take them everywhere... I'm MC Hammer 
 Started selling dough, I'm too legit to quit 
 When its hammer time, I'm pulling out the stick 
 I'm at the car lot, I'm going broke 
 I pay for 5, they find a couple more 
 I take them home, like I do my hoes 
 I dress them up, I buy them clothes 
 Glass slippers, I gas's hoes 
 Now she's acting brand new on you assholes 
 Limousines, I did that, two door coops boy I live that 
 My top back, I'm circumcised 
 I pull it back, just to go inside 
 She thinking folic, I'm thinking wings stop 
 Feening lemon pepper, I got my thing cocked 
 Black bat mobile, its only new Ferrari 
 Its called scaglietti one button like a Atari 
 I'm just advising, my profit is rising 
 Niggas buying stocks any nigga like a verizon 
 My gun dirty, my brick clean 
 I'm ridding dirty, my dick clean 
 She talk dirty but her mouth clean 
 Bitch I'm MC hammer... I'm about cream 
 I got 30 cars, hole lot of dancers 
 I take them everywhere... I'm MC Hammer 
 Started selling dough, I'm too legit to quit 
 When its hammer time, I'm pulling out the stick 
 I got the porche, I was so ecstatic 
 100 grand a day my operation is so elaborate 
 Credit card sqeems, that was for the faggots 
 Mother fuck window shopping boy I gotta have it 
 Now my shit be booming all across the atlas 
 Puchi puchi money long now we call him alex 
 Had to move from Davie 'cause that shit was local. 
 Picked up the mansion and I sat that bitch back down in Boca. 
 My badest bitch is latin but they call me loco 
 Till I fuck them in the ass out in Acapulco 
 I'm thinkin' money every moment thinkin' money 
 I bust a nut then I'm back to thinkin' money 
 My wrist froze my mind blow I'm off slow my eyes closed 
 You gotta judge a man by his principles 
 Teflon don, I am invincible 
 My gun dirty, my brick clean 
 I'm ridding dirty, my dick clean 
 She talk dirty but her mouth clean 
 Bitch I'm MC Hammer... I'm about cream 
 I got 30 cars, hole lot of dancers 
 I take them everywhere... I'm MC Hammer 
 Started selling dough, I'm too legit to quit 
 When its hammer time, I'm pulling out the stick 
 Diamonds moving on my chest, wanna Hammer dance, 
 Seventy grand make my jeans sag like some Hammer pants, 
 Ambulance, ambulance, 911, 911, 
 It's Gucci Mane, yeah that's my name, I'm going dumb, going dumb, 
 Blowing up, blowin' up, blowin' up, blowin' up, 
 I'm like MC Hammer, I put that on my grandma, 
 I ride through East Atlanta, in my new Ferrari, 
 It's a 458, if you don't have one, sorry, 
 I'll let you borrow mine, I think I'm MC Hammer, 
 I never borrowed jewlery, I'm tippin naked dancers, 
 It's an occasion, a celebration, at Central Station, 
 With Haitian hoes and Jamaicans, I'm trynna make it, 
 Old school, wanna race it? We can test it, 
 I'm flexin, I'll leave a sucker eating dust for breakfast, 
 So expect the unexpected, 
 I'm well connected, 
 I'm MC Hammer 150 on the guest list, 
 Gucci!
