You know gettin' money, becomin a young millionaire; 
 You could lose sight of the things that's important to you. 
 Olympicks 
 I'd never trade my old girl for all the money in the world. 
 I'd never trade my daughter Toya for all the money in the world. 
 I'd never trade my only boy for all the money in the world. 
 I put my last name first! 
 I can hear my Daddy sayin', "lil nigga go get 'em!" 
 Passed in '99 cancer all in his liver. 
 Shit, difference since we last spoke, his son a lil richer. 
 I'd never rap again if I could tell him that I miss him. 
 Why the fuck I own the world when I can't share it with him? 
 Bust his ass his whole life, just wanna break bread wit' him. 
 Cryin in my mansion as I'm holdin' on his picture. 
 It's a cold and lonely world, I'm flyin solo on you niggas. 
 Being the only boy, definition of a man. 
 All the money is the world still not a big enough advance. 
 All the money is the world still not a big enough advance. 
 For me to turn my back on me bein the man that I am. 
 Turn off the lights (Turn off the lights). 
 Take a ride with me (Take a ride with me). 
 I wanna see you smile (I wanna see you smile). 
 It's a fantasy (It's a fantasy). 
 La La La La Laa (La La La La Laa). 
 La La La La (La La La La). 
 La La La La Laa (La La La La Laa). 
 La La La La (La La La La). 
 Momma gettin' older feelin' pains in her shoulder. 
 I gotta stay focused and remain her little soldier. 
 Brace a few issues in the streets begin the whisper. 
 Prayin' for you niggas still stocking up my pistols. 
 Lil nigga getting murdered and buried in all white. 
 8th grade student, y'all figure that's all right. 
 Tryin' to figure out where I'm going wit' my life. 
 As I'm steppin on the brake and hangin' a sharp right. 
 Did my thing in the streets, seen in the streets. 
 See me at the park on the swing with my niece. 
 Watch chipped up, still won't switch up. 
 First time singin' so you gotta turn the bitch up. 
 Turn off the lights (Turn off the lights). 
 Take a ride with me (Take a ride with me). 
 I wanna see you smile (I wanna see you smile). 
 It's a fantasy (It's a fantasy). 
 La La La La Laa (La La La La Laa).

 La La La La Laa (La La La La Laa). 
 La La La La (La La La La). 
 Oh man- when I close my eyes, 
 I can see you about a million times. 
 It's true over and over (over and over). 
 Yeah- but then again, it kinda makes me laugh. 
 'Cause you're the one that put me on this path. 
 I guess I gotta keep rollin' strong. 
 I feel I can't go wrong. 
 'Cause I can feel you walkin' with me. 
 I can hear you talkin' to me. 
 I know you hear them sayin' La La La La La La Laa. 
 La La La La Laa. 
 La La La Laa. 
 La La La La Laa. 
 La La La Laa. 
 Now come and take a ride with me. 
 I really wanna take a walk wit' you. 
 Be cool to have a drink wit' you, think wit' you. 
 Now come and take a ride with me.
