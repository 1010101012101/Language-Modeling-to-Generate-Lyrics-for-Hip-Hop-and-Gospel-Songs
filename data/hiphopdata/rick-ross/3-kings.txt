Yeah, classic hip hop shit 
 Dr D-R-E, Rozay and Jay 
 Let's get 'em 
 We started out mopping floors 
 Now we front row at the awards 
 Number 1 for the last 20 years 
 If you real muthafucker scream cheers 
 Muthafucker scream cheers 
 And it is what it is 
 He wanted to shine at the swap meet 
 Till the white boys got him in that hot seat 
 Only love it when her hair long 
 You should listen to this beat through my headphones 
 Money long, number 1, 20 years strong 
 Fuck a gym, I am him, Andre Young 
 G5′s to '64′s, Dre got 'em 
 If the bitch bad I got her in red bottoms 
 Great weed, nice homes, bread proper 
 Tech 9, long chamber, top shotta 
 Bentley coupe, new yacht, my helicopter 
 Born broke, real nigga straight outta Compton 
 The fuck you magazine niggas want from me? 
 I rewrote the game nigga, now talk money 
 All black on my Al Capone shit 
 I built the house, nigga get ya own shit 
 I only love it when her hair long 
 You should listen to this beat through my headphones 
 See y'all niggas 
 Hit the switches on that shit one time 
 Lay the top down 
 I came along way from the weed game 
 20 stack seats at the Heat game 
 And I'm still strapped with the heat man 
 And we stepping' on a nigga feet mayne 
 8 pair of sneakers, came from the d-game 
 Cousin was a crip said it was a c-thing 
 Brown bag money in a duffle bag 
 Fuck 'em all, wet 'em, yeah we gotta double bag 
 The homie whipping chickens in his momma kitchen 
 On a mission, say he get it for son's tuition 
 Real nigga's dreams coming to fruition 
 Stumble but I never fall leaning on my pistol 
 I only love her when that ass fat 
 We used to listen to this track in my Maybach 
 I'm just tryna be a billionaire 
 Come and suck a dick for a millionaire 
 It's just different, I know it feels different 
 I only love her if her eyes brown 
 Play this shit while you play around with my crown 
 King H-O, y'all should know by now 
 If you don't know 
 Millions on my wall in all my rooms 
 Niggas couldn't fuck with my daughters room 
 Niggas couldn't walk in my daughters socks 
 Banksy bitches, Basquiats 
 I ran through that buck 50, Live Nation fronted me 
 They working on another deal, they talking 250 
 I'm holding out for 3, 275 and I just might agree 
 Ex D-boy, used to park my Beemer 
 Now look at me I can park at my own Arena 
 I only love her if her weave new 
 I'm still a hood nigga, what you want me to do? 
 Been hoppin' out the BM with your bm 
 Taking her places you can't go with your per-diem 
 Screaming carpe diem until I'm a dead poet 
 Robin Williams shit, I deserve a Golden Globe 
 I take an Ace in the meanwhile 
 You ain't gotta keep this, it's just a freestyle 
 Fuck rap money, I made more off crates 
 Fuck show money, I spent that on drapes 
 Close the curtains, fuck boy out my face 
 I whip the coke, let the lawyer beat the case 
 Murder was the case that they gave me 
 I killed the Hermes store somebody save me 
 Stuntin' to the max like wavy 
 Ooh shit, stuntin' to the max I'm so wavy 
 Used to shop in TJ Maxx back in '83 
 I didn't even know if it was open then 
 I ain't know Oprah then 
 Had the Xl80 bike, loud motor 
 They be like, damn when I'm coming through 
 Had a grill in '88 
 Y'all niggas is late 
 You got all that right? 
 I love this shit like my own daughter 
 And spray these niggas baby just like daddy taught ya 
 Young, it's just different
