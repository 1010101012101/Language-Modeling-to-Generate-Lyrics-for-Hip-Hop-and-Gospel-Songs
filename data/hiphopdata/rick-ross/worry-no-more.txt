Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected 
 I don't wanna worry no more 
 I'd give anything for you to come and help me perfect it 
 I don't worry no more, I don't worry no more 
 I won't worry 
 Wanna feel like I'm brand new 
 Even though I gotta have you 
 All them other bitches stab you 
 They was close enough to grab you 
 Ain't no other way they had to 
 I'mma always hold it down for ya 
 Look at how I move around for ya 
 Do anything that you can, to make me feel so protected 
 I don't wanna worry no more 
 Just want you to know my name 
 By the time we exit 
 Wanna feel like I'm brand new 
 Even though I gotta have you 
 All them other bitches stab you 
 They was close enough to grab you 
 I won't worry no more 
 The feeling that you give me is a coke rush 
 Addicted to fans and money, white Lamborghini 
 My name ring bells, authorities wanna see me 
 Born king, that's why she was Nefertiti 
 Never been too easy try to stay up out of debt 
 IRS is watching me, they follow what's on my neck 
 Still onto me but I'm always coming correct 
 Cause all these jewels my niggas wanna collect 
 We the biggest in the game so let's just give us respect 
 Dance like a star, ass shake like a car 
 She really something special I can tell from afar 
 Eyes on the check, 8-figures feel the best 
 Hustle on the corners, Givenchy be the finesse 
 Ex-drug dealer but still got his connects, yeah 
 Do anything that you can, to make me feel so protected 
 I don't wanna worry no more 
 Just want you to know my name 
 By the time we exit 
 I don't wanna worry no more 
 I don't wanna worry no more 
 I don't wanna worry 
 I'ma always hold it down for ya 
 Look at how I move around for ya 
 I'ma always hold it down for ya 
 Move around for ya 
 I don't wanna worry no more 
 I don't wanna worry 
 I don't wanna worry no more 
 Hold it down for ya 
 I'ma move around for ya 
 I don't wanna worry no more 
 Hold it down for ya 
 Every time I come around for ya 
 I'mma always hold it down for ya 
 Look at how I move around for ya 
 Do anything that you can, to make me feel so protected 
 I don't wanna worry, I don't wanna worry no more 
 How I move around for ya
