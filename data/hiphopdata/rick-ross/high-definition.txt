Look at this stuff, this is history here, you're history 
 This is garbage, I can say I bled for garbage 
 So this is meaningless 
 No, at one time it meant a lot. 
 When you're just a young kid this is everything to you, 
 Then you realize your priorities change. 
 And you just want your children to be happy 
 And do nice things and that makes you happy. 
 This is nothing 
 This is just nothing man 
 I can talk about the bodies, I could tell you 'bout the killing 
 Duct taping niggas in the name of drug dealin' 
 Big body Benz's while the bitch niggas starve 
 Turtleneck Mercedes blowin' smoke up out the top 
 Time to talk about the money, I can tell you 'bout a profit 
 Ocean front spot moving niggas out the projects 
 Diamonds on my neck call it the ghetto's guillotine 
 Fuckin' with them jewelers nigga lit up like a screen, HD 
 Look at me ballin' I'm talkin' high definition 
 Fuckin' up six digits, boy that's just my definition 
 Niggas gotta get murked but I'm just minding my business 
 Bought three Range Rovers dolo, so fuck Expedition 
 On the road to the riches until I'm paid in full 
 And the Lord is my witness, I got a AK to pull 
 These niggas full of shit, my niggas moving bricks 
 I could front you fifty, but you gotta move 'em quick, my moolah thick 
 Went and got me a choppa to put it right in ya face 
 Better blow out your brains before you give me a case 
 Got the forty by my dick I keep on pissin' on the hammer 
 When they talkin' slick I double back with that banana 
 High definition I'm stacking money to the ceiling 
 Fuck my ho feelings, look here, it's time to make a killin' 
 Got a hundred silent niggas and they fiending for a million 
 High definition bitches, my life a motion picture 
 I could talk about the bitches, I could tell you 'bout the bricks 
 Pull up in the Bentley I could pop up in the six 
 Helicopter rides I can sit it on the club 
 Sound of the propeller had my young bitch busting nuts 
 Niggas wanna crack jokes just to get close to me 
 Hope you know that I'm strapped like I supposed to be 
 Put a number on your helmet like it's Notre Dame 
 5 grand'll get you whacked, won't even know your name 
 Road to the riches until I'm paid in full 
 And the Lord is my witness we making major moves 
 God forgives and I don't, I got it tatted in my skin 
 I'm going straight to hell that's if ballin' is a sin 
 Crucifix on my neck I pray it never melt 
 Pacquiao purse, boy I took another belt 
 Take a seat, I'm undefeated in this art of war 
 Rest in peace to the pussies, it's time to Scar some more
