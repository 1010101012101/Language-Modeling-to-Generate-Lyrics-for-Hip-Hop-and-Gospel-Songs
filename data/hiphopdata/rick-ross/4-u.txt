Two bands for the red bottoms 
 Go where rollie live they get that good good got em, yeah 
 Ain't no comparison 
 Ricky air is in the condo in the mandarin 
 First, know I'm putting in the work 
 Then I lay back 'cause I wanna see 
 That's when I holla church 
 Black bottle boss, tell her put it in reverse 
 Baby (wassup?) 
 Standing over there 
 Resting your high heels 
 If gorgeousness was money 
 Your face would be on that bill 
 Call me dumb or cray 
 Long as you call me out someday 
 You got me thinking like you're thinking make me lose my cool 
 No, I don't care then 
 To I don't care who 
 But you gon make me do what I usually don't do 
 Make me pump my breaks 
 And do whatever it takes 
 Make you my main, that's every day 
 Girl you poppin' I won't stop for you 
 I don't even say this often 
 But fuck it I'll leave all my girls just for you 
 Cupid got me, shot me 
 Your booty got me only order for you 
 I don't even say this often 
 But fuck it I'll leave all my girls just for you 
 I put that on my mother 
 I wanna love you, I'll leave all them for you 
 Baby when you get dressed 
 I can see your L.A. Business 
 While we in Miami, I beat it so good 
 Want your body to win a Grammy girl 
 But the girls can't do what you do 
 From the time? 
 You got me thinking like I'm thinking, make me lose my cool 
 No, I don't care then 
 To I don't care who 
 But you gon' make me do what I usually don't do 
 Make me pump my breaks 
 And do whatever it takes 
 You my main, that's every day 
 Girl you poppin' I won't stop for you 
 I don't even say this often 
 But fuck it I'll leave all my girls just for you 
 Cupid got me, shot me 
 Your booty got me only order for you 
 I don't even say this often 
 But fuck it I'll leave all my girls just for you 
 I put that on my mother 
 I wanna love you, I'll leave all them for you 
 The boss is back 
 Make you a rich girl 
 Wanna hold on to me just to ride, girl 
 Big cars, drug money and cigars 
 My whole way was all just a montage 
 Can I paint a picture? 
 Do that, do that really miss ya 
 I wanna make this official 
 Make love till you cry oh my here's a tissue 
 Now ride with a thug, pistol on tuck 
 Ridin' in the Wraith, LV on the rug 
 Carol City G, well-known overseas 
 Tell me what you wanna see and I could sit it on the seat 
 Spend it on a car, now I spend it on your feet 
 Ear master ? Bumpin all in my Jeep 
 Ugh, you can hear it in the Jeans 
 And you can see it in my eyes, it's a hundred million street 
 I'm the boss 
 I don't even say this often 
 But fuck it I'll leave all my girls just for you 
 Cupid got me, shot me 
 Your booty got me only order for you 
 I don't even say this often 
 But fuck it I'll leave all my girls just for you 
 I put that on my mother 
 I wanna love you, I'll leave all them for you 
 I don't even say this often 
 But fuck it I'll leave all my girls just for you 
 Cupid got me, shot me 
 Your booty got me only order for you 
 I don't even say this often 
 But fuck it I'll leave all my girls just for you 
 I put that on my mother 
 I wanna love you, I'll leave all them for you 
 (I love you baby) 
 (For you) 
 (For you) 
 (For you)
