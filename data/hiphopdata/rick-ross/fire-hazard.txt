Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with I'm a fuckin' earner 
 Ring the fuckin' fire alarm here come the money burners 
 My money burnin, my money burnin, my money burnin 
 You see my money burnin, money burnin money burnin 
 You see the smoke bitch 
 When it come to these bitches I'm still a backbreaker 
 Let the vocals get the pussy, let the track rape her 
 Ties on the rims skinny but they fat paper 
 Like I'm fresh out bitch, its time to stack paper 
 Port of Miami my Chevy still candy 
 My chopper still fully I empty it gladly 
 Never Hollywood even though I got it good 
 I ain't got a goon, but fuck it somebody gotta do it 
 Last week You may have heard that we got into it 
 Now the boy missin' bitch you heard how them Gotti's do it (2x) 
 I'm cooking a brick which is my signature dish 
 Time to feed all my niggas this Columbian fish 
 Yellow tail, red snapper, wood chopper, gold yacht master 
 Got 'em brought to Baltimore who movin all the raw 
 With pink diamond (?) I never saw before 
 When that chopper clap it drop like a trey beat 
 Stray dog ass bitches wanna give me rabies 
 When your pockets fat them bitches stay in heat 
 Them niggas trap clothes, we gonna stay and eat 
 Them boys fire hazards when they got them choppers on em 
 Fuck crime stopper, better call 'em helicopters on em 
 Definition of slidin 187 
 Represent your side only thugs go to heaven 
 Never Hollywood even though I got it good 
 I ain't gotta goon, But fuck it somebody gotta do it 
 I grew up watching columbian drug lords 
 Who ever knew I would afford cologne by Tom Ford 
 Trips to Hawaii with Diddy on concords 
 Quarter milli in the Louis bitch pretty as Appolonia 
 I got a funny feelin' Fuckin' Feds watchin me 
 At this point only the government could stop me 
 20 Mill in Four years it's a Mobilary 
 Bon Jovi in this bitch blow for everybody 
 Ricky Ross, Rick Flair, Black watch, Brick Fair 
 Never Hollywood even though I got it good 
 I ain't got a goon but Fuck it somebody gotta do it
