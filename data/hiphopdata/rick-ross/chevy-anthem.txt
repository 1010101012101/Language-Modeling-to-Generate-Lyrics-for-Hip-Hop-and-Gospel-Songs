 (Yo Gotti) 
 I remember my first Chevy 73' 
 I was 17 ridin' wit a whole B 
 It was money green, fat boy triple gold 
 Tha 20's era, right when we stop ridin' fo's 
 Lamb'd up ride, 30 inch rims glide 
 6 feet off tha ground make it hard fa you ta see inside 
 Surround sound like a motion picture 
 Aquafina rims got my ocean spinnas 
 Hit a button, car crank up 
 Notha button, do' lift up 
 People lookin', what tha fuck 
 What is that, a car or truck 
 Hit tha lot, drop tha top 
 Bitch jump in, late ta block 
 VIP done killed tha club, headed ta my otha spot 
 Mashin off 454, look like I'm passin off 
 Rubba burnin, passin yawl 
 Rims damn near fallin' off 
 Yo Gotti, hell naw I ain't petty 
 So I wanna welcome my haters ta my 100 grand Chevy 
 Chevy ridin' high boy (Mon E. G.) 
 My Chevy stay fly (Yo Gotti) 
 Got me and yo baby mama (Mon E. G.) 
 Sittin' off in tha sky (Yo Gotti) 
 Mon E. G. (Mon E. G.) 
 Yo Gotti (Yo Gotti) 
 Its Rickey Ross (Rick Ross) 
 No lie (Mon E. G.) 
 Its tha (Mon E. G.) 
 Chevy Anthem Remix, my Chevy Ridin' High (Yo Gotti) 
 Yes Sir! (Mon E. G.) 
 (Mon E. G.) 
 Chevy ridin' high, blue candy paint make my teeth hurt 
 30's on them low pros, gas brake skee skurt 
 Suicide doors wit tha stick in tha floor 
 My whole arm stay icy, keep my dick in ya whore 
 You don't really wanna race me at tha light, red green take flight 
 Glass packs loud pipes, TV's are too bright 
 Outta spite, Ima turn up tha sound ta drown ya music 
 Cocaine white charger, reminiscin tha Cool Whip 
 2 seconds done dipped, smashed out in tha glass house 
 West Coast mentallity, here ta switch drop tha ass out 
 I'm out on errthang, underdog, deadly game, big block super fast, put that on errthang 
 You can call me Diddy like Sean, hit the bar team winnin' 
 Feelin' good like we winnin' tha World Series in tha 9th innin 
 Free ya mind like John Lennon, interior blue lemon 
 'Cause I'm true to every sentence ball out like tha Pistons 
 (Rick Ross) 
 I started sellin weed dreamin' of a 7-3 
 Dat didn't cut it so fuck it we out here sellin keys 
 Now my roof suede, and my seats gator 
 I ain't want tints, I like to see haters 
 We rollin' back to back, and we rollin' slow 
 Whitney Houston wit me, nigga I'm talkin' blow 
 You suckas talkin' slow, I'm talkin' to who coppin mo 
 They talkin' sideways, that's what tha choppas fo? 
 Sittin' on them silver datins, bumpin that bigga rankin 
 I blew out tha brains, fuck what them niggas thinkin' 
 Multi-millionaire, started wit crack crumbs 
 So when you hear them glass packs, its time to act up
