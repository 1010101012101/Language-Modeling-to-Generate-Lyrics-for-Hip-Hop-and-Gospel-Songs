 Platinum petron, come take shots with a boss 
 If you came to get the party started 
 Girl, just say, la la, la la, la 
 I want to put my hands all over your body 
 Girl, come this way, na na, na na, na 
 What you gon' do, ooh, ooh, if I touch you 
 If I put my lips on you, ooh, ooh 
 If we took you back to the crib just me and you, ooh, ooh 
 All night I want to play just say, la la, la la, la

 All you gotta do is just lay back 
 Would you do this for me, baby? 
 Just lay back, lay back

 Girl, I'm bright as a bezel, and you sexy as ever 
 Shorty what's on your brain, cause whatever is clever 
 Number one at whatever, I get bundles of cheddar 
 This that black cloud you deserve wonderful weather 
 Run a few errands

 Summers in Paris 
 Never shopping in clearance, don't make me embarrassed 
 She never a bird, but baby my parrot 
 Her flavor superb, I pay her with carrots 
 My house is her home, I made her a palette 
 Maybe being too modest, my shit more like a palace 
 Follow the waterfalls, as it makes you wetter 
 Shawty brace yourself, it's only getting better 
 If you came to get the party started 
 Girl, just say, la la, la la, la 
 I want to put my hands all over your body 
 Girl, come this way, na na, na na, na 
 What you gon' do, ooh, ooh, if I touch you 
 If I put my lips on you, ooh, ooh 
 If we took you back to the crib just me and you, ooh, ooh 
 All night I want to play just say, la la, la la, la 
 Just take off your clothes and just lay back 
 All you gotta do is just lay back 
 Would you do this for me, baby? 
 Just lay back, lay back 
 (Boss) 
 La la, la la, la 
 See shawty laid back, so we laid up 
 When I fade to black, we always made up 
 This shit ain't made up, look what I'm made of 
 Look what I made brah, don't owe no favors 
 Have 700's, first one to get it 
 My car's a virgin, first one to hit it 
 Hit the rim shop, get 'em to the hood 
 Stop by her momma house, that's if I'm feeling good 
 Now I need a fifth, time to hit the strip 
 I'ma hit the club, I'ma buy the VIP 
 We spending money, I'm talking slick 
 I hope she ride me, I'm talking stick 
 If you came to get the party started 
 Girl, just say, la la, la la, la 
 I want to put my hands all over your body 
 Girl, come this way, na na, na na, na 
 What you gon' do, ooh, ooh, if I touch you 
 If I put my lips on you, ooh, ooh 
 If we took you back to the crib just me and you, ooh, ooh 
 All night I want to play just say, la la, la la, la 
 Just take off your clothes and just lay back 
 All you gotta do is just lay back 
 Would you do this for me, baby? 
 Just lay back, lay back
