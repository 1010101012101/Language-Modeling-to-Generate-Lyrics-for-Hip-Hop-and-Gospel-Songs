A month ago, I gave a chick a hundred stacks 
 Straight to Neiman Marcus, young bitch had a heart attack 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 Bottles, Beamers, brand new Benzes 
 Barbies, ballerinas, and Britneys 
 Barbra Streisand edition Bentleys 
 Bricks, big face hundreds in bundles 
 Boy, I'm a boss, I rose from the jungles 
 God forgives and these killers won't 
 In a room full of heathens, good niggas die alone 
 Better start taking notes as I'm taking tokes 
 The hood wanna see you die and they taking votes 
 My vision always mentioned coke 
 My women never sit in coach 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 Tongue kissin' a dark skinneded vixen 
 Fifty, sixty racks, I might go blow a hundred though 
 Jet owner, G5, where you wanna go? 
 Fuck your ex's baby, really, that's your past? 
 Load up your carry-on's and all of this is cash 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 East Coast to West Coast, all my bitches 
 Tryna bring you into my world, baby 
 Just stand there, you the canvas, imma paint the picture 
 You never met another nigga, you know, fuck it, take it 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 East Coast to West Coast, all my bitches 
 Tryna bring you into my world, baby 
 Just stand there, you the canvas, imma paint the picture 
 You never met another nigga, you know, fuck it, take it 
 Am I really just a narcissist? 
 'Cause I wake up to a bowl of lobster bisque 
 And I wake up on some mobbin' shit 
 With a great view and half my niggas swappin' bricks 
 It's just a way of life 
 For the king of diamonds, so I gotta stay the night 
 50 cash in the Louis for the chicken wings 
 Started in a neighborhood and now we on to bigger things 
 Large clique of my constituents 
 Combination to the safe, straight to the Benjamins 
 Living life to the fullest was the emphasis 
 Making love to Mary J's "Reminisce" 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 East Coast to West Coast, all my bitches 
 Tryna bring you into my world, baby 
 Just stand there, you the canvas, imma paint the picture 
 You never met another nigga, you know, fuck it, take it 
 It was all good just a week ago 
 Paper tag on the Panamera, my speakers blow 
 My bitch sittin' cute, she left her panties home 
 Suckin' the dick of the don, I'm talking Miami's own 
 Money like (LeBron James), money like (Dwyane Wade) 
 (Play it right) peelin' two off the dealership in the same day 
 (Say it right) paid like Mark Clayton, Mark Duper 
 Soon as niggas start hatin', start shootin' 
 Come along, money longer than Olajuwan's 
 Lotta ones, all the bitches yeah the model ones 
 Tongue pierced, dick sucked, yeah the swallow ones 
 Fifty million, I'm the only one that got it done 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 Oh man, I love my bitches 
 East Coast to West Coast, all my bitches 
 Tryna bring you into my world, baby 
 Just stand there, you the canvas, imma paint the picture 
 You never met another nigga, you know, fuck it, take it
