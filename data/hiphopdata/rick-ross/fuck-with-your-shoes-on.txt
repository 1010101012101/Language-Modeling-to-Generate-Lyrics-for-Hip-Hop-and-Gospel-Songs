Trina 
 You wanna fuck me? handcuff me? 
 You betta wine and dine me 
 Cop me the biggest diamond you can find me 
 Some librachi shit that'll blind me 
 G.G hunna tiffany necklace 
 Fly me to Paris just fo breakfast 
 Sip champagne dress the freshest 
 Hoppin out the cario lay Lexus 
 Material girl like Madonna 
 Ms. Trina the prima donna 
 Bad bitch with the beed an' the power 
 Ice in my neck and its freeze in ma colla 
 So what you wanna do tonight? 
 You wanna get me in the mood tonight? 
 Lick me down low do what you like just make sure I get my NUT tonight. 
 Rick Ross 
 Ima man that can move slow 
 Let me get it wet first; sex, ima expert 
 You gon love a nigga bet by tha next verse 
 Raw, set, thaz right (thaz right) 
 Lets ride (lets ride) cruz slow 
 Thaz how stretched out in tha S5 
 Shorties wave from tha corner wen I come through 
 Many hoes wana holla but I want chu 
 You know I got a spot now at tha yawt house 
 Like a month ago wanna go let tha cock out 
 Not now but we to far to stop now 
 She dun crossed her arms yeah she call herself hot now 
 Cool off with tha top down 
 Oh boy. fuck wit a po' boy 
 U need a nigga like me girl (so real) 
 My money longer then tha distance on yo phone bill 
 I shouldn't hear those words that I caint touch 
 When I got you in Paris like it ain't much 
 First class, coach you know that ain't us 
 Cumin back to back tongue lookin' like a paint brush 
 Me and my nigga dem feel us

 Other person: 
 Check it out right imma 2 at time type 
 Head dyke, sistaz, friendz, 
 Night stiff when I'm in those skins 
 Quit fightin it and jus fight tha dick 
 Ima skeet at tha peek of tha heat 
 Put cream on tha sheets, whip cream in tha sheets 
 Cancel yo husband dance wit a thug 
 Then afta tha club -I'm gettin' into sumthin- 
 A few hundred is nothin' 
 I run through numberz 
 Fo all you newcommers ain't know 
 They come and tha go 
 I cum in they throat 
 Some of choke but sum of them go 
 But the funny thing is nun of 'em say no 
 And why's that? 'cause of high stats 
 'Cause a nigga can't hide then dipads 
 When I fly pass you try ta catch! 
 Just a lil bit of contact 
 Windows down, get a whiff of that indo now 
 Request sex; even tho we jus met 
 I need a bitch a can keep on deck 
 Strictly fo neck when I be on X 
 Neva spill drink but she sink in tha lex 
 U got a thing for rings or regrets 
 Wit tha card tell big things come next yes.
