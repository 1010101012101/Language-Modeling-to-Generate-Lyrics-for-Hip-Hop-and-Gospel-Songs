Oh honey please, don't shed no tears 
 As long as I'm here... 
 Its far too early in the morning to be trying to call you 
 And far too early in the daytime to be thinking about that 
 But I, (but I), but I, (but I), but I am 
 What did I do in a past life, oh to deserve this 
 Yeah the way I make myself 
 He's far too innocent to be a part of such a cruel world 
 And it is, and it is and it is 
 And so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride. 
 Hoping I can write her a rhyme, that might stop the tick of time 
 Get off this situation and feel fine, 
 Get off this situation and feel fine. 
 What did I do to deserve her love, 
 I have to ask myself. 
 When I am such a bad man but only to her (only to her, only, only to her) 
 Oh and so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride. 
 Oh and so I'll go, yes I'll go, so I'll take that train and ride. 
 Wishing, hoping I can write her a rhyme, that might stop the tick of time 
 Get off this situation and feel fine, 
 Get off this situation and feel fine.
