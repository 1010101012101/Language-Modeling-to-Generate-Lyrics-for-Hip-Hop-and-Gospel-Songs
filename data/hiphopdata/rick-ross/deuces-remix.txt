What you mean I ain't call you? 
 I hit you when I landed 
 I'm waiting in my hotel room 
 Seems like we are arguing more and it's getting less romantic 
 Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon 
 But I fucked you right, I will 
 I fucked you right I will 
 I'll fuck you like no one has ever ever made you feel 
 I mean this part of our relationship's amazing still 
 I might just put up with the arguing and stay for real 
 You looking bad, girl for goodness sakes 
 You with all those curves and me without no breaks 
 Ooh, I'm willing to work it out however long it takes you 
 You feel like you miss those happy days well girl that makes two of us 
 Our timing is wrong 
 Your friends always tying up every line on your phone 
 Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my Mrs 
 And the hardest part about the fucking business is minding your own 
 Uh, and every time I try and break it off 
 We just yell until we tired then I break you off 
 It's useless all this fighting let's get past it now 
 Even when I throw them deuces you just send it back around 
 Your wrist and fingers glisten 
 Ice cold like Michigan 
 Eh look at what we living in 
 Here we go with this again 
 I just keep on talking but I guess that you ain't listening 
 Rather run around with them nothing ass bitches 
 Then, go on, got me hot, smoking like a chimney 
 We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemy's 
 Deep inside it's killing me 
 But soon it's gonna be killing you 
 To see her in that two seater, now that's gonna hurt your feelin's boo 
 Ah ha, didn't you think you would be over me 
 By now so you go sleeping with them clowns, they are no relief 
 She spoke her piece, I know, capisce 
 So love must be let go, released 
 Into the wind, again again and deuces I must throw ya peace 
 You know what, yo? 
 You a bitch! 
 You should have a travel agent cause you a trip 
 You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit 
 But all you got is some fucking issues you fucking bitch 
 I hate niggas, but I love your mom 
 Give her a kiss for me, her second son 
 Get your mind right baby or get your shit together 
 You gonna be hot a little while 
 I'mma be rich forever 
 Girl seducers, they come in Deuces 
 When I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance 
 Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag 
 He just took my old bitch and turn it to his new bitch 
 Hehe. I'm stupid 
 But I won't get my drama on 
 What I'm dealing with is too real for me to comment on 
 Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth 
 So when you talk bout "you know who" I don't know who you talkin' bout 
 According to my old bitch I be on some new shit 
 She was on some old shit, now I got a new bitch 
 Think I give two shits 
 You ain't gonna do shit 
 Meet my two fingers, intro... deuces 
 If you knew better you'd do better 
 Wanna get the middle finger but I got two better 
 So you gonna diss me even though you know it's wrong 
 Know you gonna (miss me a little when I'm gone) 
 Drizzy voice, now I'm ghost baby 
 Four door Rizzy Royce 
 Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice 
 I'm bout my business boys 
 Plus I make paper 
 Come on that's old news 
 Yesterday's paper 
 Oh, you talkin', what about? 
 If it ain't how I kept you studded out 
 You might as well shut ya mouth 
 You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out 
 Act like there's gum in your hair girl, cut it out 
 Got a pocket full of hundreds 
 She the only one is missing 
 Got a bucket full of ice 
 And a watch to go with it 
 Got a racing Lamborghini 
 Have my homies scared to drive 
 Haters better put their head down they know that boy be fly 
 All the charter planes 
 Now I'm talking ballers slang 
 R.O.Z.A.Y on that wall in the hall of fame 
 I let my denim sag 
 Red Louis belt 
 How can you love me baby, first you gotta love yourself! 
 The farewell email from a female 
 But I'm a player, ain't gonna tell you all the details 
 What it entails is hard to say like selling seashells 
 By the seashore, but she's not a bore but neither a whore 
 Who needs to know more 
 The kind you can't ignore but want to open the door... for, 
 Or run in your favourite store and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't your's, 
 I did things for, ain't rich ain't poor 
 I want it to do more but hell I just ain't know her 
 Well enough to know if this is all she came for 
 But enough to know tonight excited she came four 
 Times to my cousins house to see if I was there 
 Get ya minds out the gutter man 
 We out here tryna have a good time 
 And here I am, all heavy with the words where 
 Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward 
 But shit they asked for it 
 It's hard to throw up them deuces 'cause when you know it's juicy 
 You start to sound like Confucius when making up excuses 
 Chase the Cabooses until the track gone 
 I gotta find me a new locomotive stop making sad songs 
 I'm on some new shit 
 I'm chucking my deuces up to her 
 I'm moving on to something better, better, better 
 No more trying to make it work 
 You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her
