This is mafia music... 
 And a maybach that is 
 Had to take it Deeper Than Rap baby... 
 Bossssss! 
 (Avery Storm) 
 The last bird flew the coop 
 I lose the roof 
 Ain't nothin' but the wind in my hair 
 I'm not bullet proof, I'm fully proof 
 That you can make it here 
 All that livin' fast 
 It ain't got to last 
 Now I can't slow it down 
 Because I'm sittin' on top of the world and I'm not comin' down 
 (Rick Ross) 
 Burnin but I got it smellin like it's butterscotch 
 Every bird boss take it to another notch 
 Bitch I'm busy baby go and suck anotha cock 
 Fuck a hater make me throw away another glock 
 Money in the mansion, yayo in another spot 
 Guns in the attic, mama help me put 'em up 
 She'll put'em down, tell you quick to hit'em up 
 Load a hundred round, bring it back, she'll fill it up 
 Like the time when the niggas pay this counterfit 
 He count chips but that trick mayor got'em flip 
 We ain't playin' man slang for them dollar bills 
 Quarter million for the chain help the collar chill 
 (Avery Storm) 
 Miami nights, 
 I'm livin' the life 
 'Cause I'm rich off cocaine 
 'Cause I'm rich off cocaine 
 The last bird flew the coop 
 I lose the roof 
 Ain't nothin' but the wind in my hair 
 I'm not bullet proof, I'm fully proof 
 That you can make it here 
 All that livin' fast 
 It ain't got to last 
 Now I can't slow it down 
 Because I'm sittin' on top of the world and I'm not comin' down 
 (Rick Ross) 
 How you seen a kilo started at an eight ball 
 First 48 to homicide ain't soft 
 Comin' from your hoes, fucking for your paint job 
 Catch you casin daddy let you know you king kong 
 Cop a 20 keys gotta be finna keep 
 I got a tenesse to send 'em up to Tenesee 
 Black Infinity the kind to ride on Venice Beach 
 I watch you slow Apollo while I'm chillin' sippin tea 
 Lemons and honey, millions of money 
 Gucci, Louis Vitton, specifically homey 
 My woman imported, I'm neva extorted 
 I'm very important, 20 grand for the mortgage

 Baby mamas I hate 'em 
 They Just want you to pay them 
 I'm in love wit my babies 
 Maybe makin' 'em famous 
 Don't be raisin your voice 
 That's another retainer 
 Know you missing a nigga 
 Know you missin' that anal 
 Know you missin' that Prada 
 How we did in regada 
 She was callin me daddy 
 Daddy drippin in dollars 
 Daddy did it in Vegas 
 Yeah I gotta connect 
 I get 'em ten a piece as soon as I keep it correct 
 Vacation to Haiti 
 It nearly broke my heart 
 Seein kids starve 
 I thought about my autumn bach 
 Sellin dope ain't right 
 I put it in my life 
 Chickens put me in position to donate the rice
