Time is money (mula) Mind is funny (yes) 
 Trust me she lyin' if she dein she love me 
 Make up ya mind you been on and off (Ross) 
 Platinum petron come take shots with a boss 
 (Hook: Robin Thicke) 
 If you came to get the party started girl just say lalalalaa 
 I want to put my hands all over ya body girl cum this way Nananana naaa 
 What you gon do if I touch you if I put my lips on you 
 If we took you back to the crib just me and you all night 
 I want to play just say (lalalala) 
 Just Take off ya clothes and just lay back all you got to do is 
 Just lay back wouldd you do this for me baby just lay back lay back

 Rick Ross: 
 Girl I'm Bright as a Bessel 
 And you sexy as ever 
 Shorty what's on ya brain cause watevea is clever 
 Number 1 at whatevea I get buddles of cheddar 
 This that black cloud you deserve wonderful weather 
 Run a few arrons (Ross) 
 Summers in Paris never shoppin' in clearance 
 Don't make me embrass 
 She never a bird but baby my parrot 
 Her flavor superb I pay her with carrots 
 My house is a home 
 I made her a pallet 
 Maybe being to modest 
 My shxt more like a palace 
 Follow the waterfalls 
 As it makes you wetter 
 Shawty brace yourself it's only getting better

 Just lay back (ok) lay back (Boss) lalalalaaa 
 See shawty laid back 
 So we laid up 
 When I fade to black we always made up 
 This shit ain't made up 
 Look what I'm made of 
 Look what I made bra 
 Don't owe no favors
