(Rick Ross) 
 Two door Bugatti coupe 
 I call it Katy Perry 
 Wiz Khalifa papers 
 Smokin' my favorite berry's 
 F65 I call it Rihanna 
 It got a red top but it's white like Madonna 
 Made man, you hear what I said 
 Having a slumber party all my bitches counting bread 
 Made man, also known as Papi Chulo 
 And I'm running straight up in the culo 
 My wrist always on frio, call me chilly chill 
 Super head and super head, and I really will 
 Californication, Motivation in my pocket 
 Got on my blue Dickie, shout out my n-gga Rocky 
 Still smoking sickie, it ain't no other option 
 Not for made n-ggas and I'm never stopping 
 I raised the bar, I set the standards 
 My yayo, Usher Raymond, that b-tch just keep on dancing 
 Dollar bills on top of dollar bills 
 That's all I'm throwing, if she won't her momma will 
 Made n-ggas, talking a lot of skrill 
 8 digits a n-gga tryna live 
 Made man, you hear what I said 
 I got a hundred squares 
 If you scared, called the feds 
 Made men, I'm screaming dollar bills 
 Park the trunk on the Porsche 
 There they go, Dollar bills

 Riding round the city, plastic cup of Henny 
 Find a n-gga like me, truth to be told, I don't know many 
 I say shout my driver Lauren, that's 62 with curtains 
 Can't see shit, I don't know where the f-ck I'm at for certain 
 When it boils down, I'm just a T.O n-gga 
 But bitches tell me that I just look like a creole n-gga 
 New Orleans know it's love, every time I'm in town 
 Shout out my n-gga tens, that's my brother my round 
 Spending tomorrows money, I call it ma
