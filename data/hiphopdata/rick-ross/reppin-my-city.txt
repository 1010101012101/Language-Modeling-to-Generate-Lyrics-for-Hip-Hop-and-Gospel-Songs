 Rick Ro$$: 
 Let the top back on the Chevy 
 Then I crank up the boom 
 Smellin' Issey Miyake 
 Soon as I step in the room 
 Hundred thousand in jewels 
 That's a whole lotta moves 
 So what's a soldier to do 
 Standin' in his bloody boots 
 Yeah I'm fresh outta boot camp 
 Ain't gotta food stamp 
 Counterfeit bills will get you killed 
 Now where the goons at 
 It's poppin' in Opalocka, floppin' them candy paints 
 Chrome Daytons, 12 pack of 12's in the 7 trey 
 Still hustle everyday, Dade County be the place 
 Get murdered for a burger with a nickel-plated burner 
 Still burnin' rubber, bustin' rubbers 
 And these bitches under cover 
 Tell the truth I ain't a lover 
 But I fuck her like I love her Boss... 
 I be Reppin' My City I be Reppin' My City 
 I be Reppin' My City 
 I be Reppin' My City er er er'y night 
 I be Reppin' My City 
 I be Reppin' My City 
 I be Reppin' My City, no one can do it better. 
 Triple C: 
 I be Reppin' My City 
 I be grippin' them cities 
 I be flippin' them pennies 
 Turn 'em to good and plenty 
 I be strokin' that pussy 
 I be smokin' that kushie 
 I be flippin' them flounders 
 They be huntin' my bounty 
 I'm the face of the hood 
 Every place in the hood 
 Triple C's in there 
 Come get a taste of my hood 
 I'm the captain of the corner 
 Khaki's & Coronas 
 Now we gotta show 'em 
 So let's patch 'em up and blow 'em 
 Now, blow the dice, shake 'em 
 Roll 'em, don't throw 'em 
 Hand clap, where it's at 
 Nigga show me somethin' 
 Out in Sixy, Opalock, overtime, city buy 
 You know how we get it Don 
 Nigga, that's how I bet a thou 
 Project Poe, I'm the project hoe 
 That means, every time I talk, the projects spoke 
 And we in the same struggle 
 So the projects know 
 Gotta million dollar profit 
 Singin' project notes 
 Just know...

 Triple C: 
 This what I'm talkin' 'about right here Poe... 
 Wherever I'm at I'm good nigga, Hood Nigga 
 First sign of problems, eliminate 
 Wish a nigga would act 
 Like he can't have rappers slip out the boroughs. 
 Rosero with the word, roses hit your mirror 
 Cartel representers, center of the war zone 
 Super cats on the coupe, cover of the whole zone 
 Catch me in the Source, double XL rated 
 Next to million dollar Nextel 
 Workin' ain't trippin' other checks now 
 Super sells, so the pussy's platinum 
 Back to the basics 
 You in danger at 16 with the beam 
 One in the chamber aimed at that 0 7 
 Got the chopper close by 
 Head buster from the Bronx 
 Rep My City every night 
 Hundred thousand worth of ice 
 Tight work, boy that's life work 
 Crystal clear starin' make your eyes hurt 
 Time for the new breed, Triple C 
 Custom cars and cycles 
 Psycho path for my math 
 Put my hand on the pipe torch. 
 I be Reppin' My City I be Reppin' My City 
 I be Reppin' My City 
 I be Reppin' My City er er er'y night 
 I be Reppin' My City

 Brisco:

 I be Reppin' My block 
 I be Reppin' My hood 
 I be Reppin' the locks 
 Welcome to dade county 
 This the bottom of the beaker 
 Where the beach is sexy blue 
 And the cocaine cheaper 
 High 9 5 nigga, Let Me Ride 
 I'm in that dolphin-colored S5 
 Fire, look at me, I'm 
 Bouncin' with that chick 
 Got the grill out my left fold 
 See how now I live 
 Call me Mr. Stephon 
 I gotta plush seat from Ingo P 
 Just know I Rep My City through Miami's E 
 Yeah, I'm Miami's Baby...
