You think you using me 
 Like this games new to me 
 But you ain't confusing me 
 You just want jewelry and all them fuckin' shopping sprees 
 But that ain't stopping me 
 And I ain't stopping you 
 See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part 
 Just play your part 
 Just play your part 
 We'll be cool as long as you just play your part

 I'm incline with women who come on they time 
 She came over and she came a few times 
 From crispy futons to Christian Louboutin 
 Game over had her shopping in Milan 
 20 racks really that's sneaker money 
 Triple white Ferrari yeah that's the Easter bunny 
 At the Ceaser in Vegas yeah I put the Visa on it 
 Now all she do is tell me how she used to love me 
 I let her decorate the real estate 
 And I let her spend a half the ticket give or take 
 A couple dollars Harry Winstone stone collars 
 Canary yellow everything plane chartered 
 I spolied her maybe 'cause I adored her 
 More than fly that girls a flying saucer 
 My Mona Lisa painting on the wall came to life 
 And she said the love of picture just roll the dice 
 You think you using me 
 Like this games new to me 
 But you ain't confusing me 
 You just want jewelry and all them fuckin' shopping sprees 
 But that ain't stopping me 
 And I ain't stopping you 
 See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part 
 Just play your part 
 Just play your part 
 We'll be cool as long as you just play your part

 I try to love 'em in the physical not literal 
 She said she love me but what I'm feeling is minuscule 
 I understand that Prada lives in her inner soul 
 So the devil that droves in her got in control 
 Anne Hathaway, and sack chasin' getting got cake up 
 Though my paper way thicker than model make up 
 But y'all wait up my mind racing my toe slippin 
 A lot of women is real some bitches Robin Givings 
 I never give 'em no liquid no pot to piss in 
 I tend to leave them quite offended if they too dependent 
 I'm pitchin bitches that's dreamin' thinking I'm trickin' chicken 
 I'm simply fuckin' with bitches that know they whole position 
 That's real nigga shit 
 Real nigga life 
 I give my heart to one broad, the others get the pipe 
 I ain't tryna fight, I ain't tryna fuss 
 I trying for the money, they tryna fall in love. 
 You think you using me 
 Like this games new to me 
 But you ain't confusing me 
 You just want jewelry and all them fuckin' shopping sprees 
 But that ain't stopping me, 
 And I ain't stopping you 
 See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part 
 Just play your part

 I say, how can they compare to you 
 Everything material 
 Trickin' shit for kids and you know I don't need no cereal 
 You know I was ridin' and you switched up a gear or two 
 So I let others shit you on dead, burial 
 Funeral, check my phone, reacting like its new to you 
 Talking what I give but never speak on what I do for you 
 Cabo to Jamaica every weekend honey moon and you 
 Like the sound and I ain't ever try tuning you 
 But now I'm just assuming you 
 Living off of hearsay 
 Treble like the radio 'cause everything was fair play 
 1st class herm ass 
 Panamera perp pass 
 Greed written on her face 
 When I bought her first bag 
 And I ain't really give a fuck 
 It was like a nigga rushed 
 Told my jeweler make her freeze like I was tryna stick her up 
 She call me daddy like a nigga puff 
 Just play your role and you can live it up 
 You think you using me 
 Like this games new to me 
 But you ain't confusing me 
 You just want jewelry and all them fuckin' shopping sprees 
 But that ain't stopping me 
 And I ain't stopping you 
 See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part 
 Just play your part 
 Just play your part 
 We'll be cool as long as you just play your part
