I seen a homeboy die in cold blood 
 Eyes rolled in his head wasn't no love 
 His momma sold pussy daddy was a fiend 
 He from a place where niggas don't believe in dreams 
 Niggas snortin' powder (Maybach Music) 
 I seen a homeboy die in cold blood 
 Eyes rolled in his head wasn't no love 
 His momma sold pussy daddy was a fiend 
 He from a place where niggas don't believe in dreams 
 Niggas snortin' powder get you're head right 
 Get your dick sucked sittin' at the red light 
 Now you catchin' cases 
 Talkin' home invasions 
 How you get a bond 
 How the fuck you playin' 
 Can't be playin' games on the home field 
 Open up like a YAGHHHH when that dome peel YAGHHH 
 We didn't have shit when we went to school 
 Now it's flat screens up in every room 
 Nigga do the math bucket full of crab 
 Tub full of money candy on the slab 
 Teflon underneath my fresh tag 
 Bell Harbor walkin' out with 40 bags 
 I could fuck a model for an autograph 
 8 cars still make her call a cab 
 Shout out to Def Jam 
 Shout out to Warner Brothers 
 Shout out to Dope Boys 
 We all need each other 
 I'm in Anguilla, I'm smoking killer 
 We run the game, pussy boy go cry a river 
 A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like 
 A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like 
 A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like 
 Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like 
 They smile in my face that's what I don't like 
 They steal your whole sound that's a sound bite 
 The media crucify me like they did Christ 
 They want to find me not breathing like they found mike 
 A girl will run her mouth only out of spite 
 But ill never hit a woman never in my life 
 I was in to deep like my? 
 And that pussy so deep I could of drown twice 
 Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice 
 Eaten good vegitary with the brown rice 
 Girls kissin' girls, cause its hot right 
 But unless they use a strap-on than their not dikes 
 They ain't about that life 
 They ain't about that life 
 We hanging out the window its about to be a suge knight 
 Shout out to derrick rose Free Bump J, real nigga for life 
 Shout out to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice 
 Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie right? 
 Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? right 
 A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like 
 A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like 
 A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like 
 Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like 
 (Young Chop on the beat) 
 Fake Gucci, that's that shit I don't like 
 Smoking on this dope, higher than a kite 
 This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe 
 Screaming Sosa, that's that nigga that I like 
 I don't want relations, I just want one night 
 Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like 
 I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life 
 And I stunt so much in clothes, 'cause I'm living life 
 I come up on the scene, and I'm stealing light 
 Bitch I'm high off life, got me feeling right 
 Bitch I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like 
 And bitch we GBE, we just go on sight 
 A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like 
 A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like 
 A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like 
 Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like 
 I done sold purple, I done sold white 
 Running outta work, that's that shit I don't like 
 She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice 
 She blowing up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like 
 Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut 
 Put the pressure on 'em just when they think that I eased up 
 Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother 30 for the Jesus 
 Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas 
 A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like 
 A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like 
 A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like 
 Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
