This outta jean, and the head full of dough (Yeah) 
 Bottle on tha' rose, pass me some mo' 
 I got, mo' cars, mo' cars, mo' clothes, mo' clothes 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 Way up in them Tailie Hills, burnin' like the sun set 
 A nigga' wit' a attitude, take it outta' context 
 Ride wit' that big thangs, lookin' like a parmtret 
 Beer than beer Afghan in a palm best 
 Ross, straight on the defro' 
 Makavali's on the Maybach, kicks retro 
 She wanna gaves at the sauce 
 Pullin' up at the juice, gettin' sage for the jaw 
 Rick Ross, I'm the best in the flesh 
 Gettin' less than reject, it's a way to reflect 
 Hard work, painties off, I'm a boss, you can tell 
 By the balls in the pail, and the bottles that we shell 
 I'm in a real, a state, in a real, a state of mine 
 We came for trigga' plate, kill a nigga' for a dime 
 I'm tryna' chill today, I got a million on my mind 
 Dice in my hand, one roll, I blow ya' mind 
 (Chorus: Rick Ross (Dre)) 
 This outta jean, and the head full of dough (Yeah) 
 Bottle on tha' rose, pass me some mo' 
 I got, mo' cars, mo' cars, mo' clothes, mo' clothes 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ross) 
 Mo' trips, mo' whips, mo' money, I'm mo' rich 
 Mo' hatas', mo' clips, mo' jewels, mo' chris 
 Half a hundread grand, this a rubberband 
 That's all vest, in my other hand 
 On the other hand, I'm still pitchin' other Hen' 
 All soft, balls off, bitch a stunna', man 
 Mo' trucks, mo' bucks, mo' freaks, mo' butts 
 I see the vision, for club vision, the prephet 
 I get brain, I bust nuts, in each states 
 Soon as I see what I'm lookin' for 
 I sit up in that seat, they cut em' off on them 24's 
 There it goes, baby gurl' come talk wit' tha' boss 
 I pop a rose bottles, you can get ya' shoes off 
 (Chorus: Rick Ross (Dre)) 
 This outta jean, and the head full of dough (Yeah) 
 Bottle on tha' rose, pass me some mo' 
 I got, mo' cars, mo' cars, mo' clothes, mo' clothes 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow 
 (Verse 3: Rick Ross) 
 Ever seen a fat boy in a big body 
 Know you wanna sit bout' me, all you do is sick bobby 
 Less a part, mess to get kicked daddy 
 Next day, buy a condo to get kick outty 
 We don't take it for the few, this is what I do 
 Wait em' on the beach, all my diamonds off gonna' blue 
 So let's party like the pack jam, Pacman 
 Fifty grand, stack in my lap man 
 Get a lap dance, and if you get my dick hard 
 This ya' last chance, to up up on that big car 
 Wit' tha' Fat Man, certified Hood Star 
 But wit' a millionaire, look bitch you gone far 
 This the movement, a few niggas' you wanna' move wit' 
 Gucci on my feet, see I'm only in that new shit 
 Ha, they say life's a bitch 
 But close ya' eyes for a minute, and just bite this dick, it's Ross 
 (Chorus: Rick Ross (Dre)) 
 This outta jean, and the head full of dough (Yeah) 
 Bottle on tha' rose, pass me some mo' 
 I got, mo' cars, mo' cars, mo' clothes, mo' clothes 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow 
 (Chorus: Rick Ross (Dre)) 
 This outta jean, and the head full of dough (Yeah) 
 Bottle on tha' rose, pass me some mo' 
 I got, mo' cars, mo' cars, mo' clothes, mo' clothes 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' money, then smoke mo' blow
