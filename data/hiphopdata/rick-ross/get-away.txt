Rick Ross (verse 1) 
 Sometimes I rhyme slow 
 Sometime I rhyme quick 
 Sometime I buy blow, so I supply bricks 
 Mufuckers lookin' at me sideways 
 But can they tell that I'm gettin' money fly ways, lotta leatherwood, and they seats vibrate, chattin wit a bitch like your boys on myspace, but she right here in my face, take her to a fly place, with a fly fireplace, no marshmellows, we let the dro burn, I dun seen the world, girl its ur turn, I told you lies all my life, but you hold me down wrong or right, so its only right she get that porsche truck, all black black rims call her porsche, let ur weave blow in the wind, 'cause believe every d boy need a friend 
 Mario Winans (chorus) 
 When can we, get away and enjoy each other, get away and explore each other 
 All I wanna know is, when can we, get away and exchange our feelings, keep it poppin' like a movie scrennin, I only wanna get away 
 Rick Ross (verse 2)
