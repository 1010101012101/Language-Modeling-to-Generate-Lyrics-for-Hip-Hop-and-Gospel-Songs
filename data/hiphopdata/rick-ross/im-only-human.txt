Rick Ro$$: 
 Lord knows I ain't perfect. 
 Rodney (Rick Ro$$): 
 I'm Only Human 
 I'm Only Human 
 I'm a man, I make mistakes 
 I'm a make... I'm a make... I'm a make mistakes. 
 (Rodney, I love you, homey!) 
 I'm Only Human. 
 (Appreciate it, dog!) 
 I'm a man, I make mistakes 
 I'm a make my mistakes. 
 Rick Ro$$: 
 12 years old and you dealin' crack 
 Your mama only 26. How she deal with that? 
 Got a deadbeat dad, but he far from dead 
 He never knew chocolate milk make you [...] real bad (Naw!) 
 One thing that I wish I could change 
 Just to see my daddy wavin' at a football game 
 Just to see my daddy standin' when they say my name 
 Walk me to the locker room and say "Son, good game! " (For real!) 
 You make a tackle, but nobody there to clap 
 So I'm writin' down my feelings, never knew it was a rap 
 Our house burnt down, we livin' in motels 
 So no matters how it sound, let me give you the whole tale! 
 Goddamn! Now the tears won't stop! 
 Mama held down 3 jobs. Can she live on top? 
 Never flew on a plane till my LP drop 
 So I told her once week that her ears are gonna' pop! 
 (Ro$$!) 
 Rodney: 
 Oh, yeah! 
 I'm Only Human 
 I'm a man, I make mistakes 
 I'm a make... I'm a make... I'm a make mistakes 
 I'm Only Human 
 I'm a man, I make mistakes 
 I'm a make my mistakes. 
 Rick Ro$$: 
 Wake up Sunday morning, wanna see my son 
 He already wanna see his sister, he ain't seen in months 
 I know it's about the dollars, so I'm steamin' blunts 
 At the custody hearin' & I'm clean as fuck! (Boss!) 
 I ain't mad at cha girl, do your thing! 
 Last night I hit the club & I threw that change! (Yeah!) 
 I'm a write you off, unemployed to a Boss! 
 Another young broad, I'll run in there raw! 
 Raw, raw, oh yes I am! 
 Chevy on ground, call it Mex I Can 
 I run D.C. like Leo G 
 In A T L, I keep a bird in the P O T 
 M I A! I'm The Mayor on my J O B 
 You OD'd, O Z's on the C O D 
 Bink in VA, drinkin' V8 
 Squeek-kays got me ready to sneak the DA! 
 Rodney: 
 Oh, yeah! 
 I'm Only Human 
 I'm a man, I make mistakes 
 I'm a make... I'm a make... I'm a make mistakes 
 I'm Only Human 
 I'm a man, I make mistakes 
 I'm a make my mistakes. 
 Rick Ro$$: 
 I know I'm not perfect (For real!) 
 But I perfected, what I had to work with 
 Trunk full of sack, sayin' my prayers 
 Let me cut the music down so The Lord can hear! 
 Psalm 27, ink tatted in my arm 
 Made me think back, when I was baggin' up a bong 
 Young D Boys always braggin' about the run 
 I was on my 3rd Rolley - now, I guess we're the bomb! 
 Now it's deep cuts in the club for the watch 
 Might let 2 dimes just fuck while I'll watch! 
 I'm a Delano, it's Tony Soprano 
 I fuck with Chicano's 
 They get it, G, I know! 
 Rodney: 
 Oh, yeah! 
 I'm Only Human 
 I'm a man, I make mistakes 
 I'm a make... I'm a make... I'm a make mistakes 
 I'm Only Human 
 I'm a man, I make mistakes 
 I'm a make my mistakes. 
 I'm Only Human 
 I'm a man, I make mistakes 
 I'm a make... I'm a make... I'm a make mistakes 
 I'm Only Human 
 I'm a man, I make mistakes 
 I'm a make my mistakes.
