Down in the dirty south to be exact 
 Gettin' money, gettin' money is a well known fact 
 I hit heavy in the trunk so I say I'm heavy hittin' 
 My car just got a jerry curl, the paint's still drippin' 
 My whip so clean, I turn lovers into haters 
 Then I make 'em come around like curl activator 
 There are none greater, I'm the freshest on the scene 
 Rap gamin' Jones, I'm the freshest on the team 
 But really, I'm a coach spittin' game to the playas 
 And I'm yellow with that purp like I came with the Lakers 
 I'm out to get that paper, the mule and the achers 
 I'm reppin' for the rich, red, monkey bathing apers 
 So catch a contact like you inhaled luda vapours 
 'Cause rapers get smoked like I rolled in some paper 
 Put 'em in a ashtray, throw away the roches 
 Move them out my pathway, show them whose the dopist 
 I bring home the bacon and protect it with the toffers 
 Like the lens on ya camera, fuck, boy, I'm so focused

 20 grand in the left 
 Another 20 in the right 
 Got my wallet in the back 
 And that thing packed tight 
 Credit cards don't need 'em or the birds won't feed 'em 
 While I'm sitting at the table just me and family eatin' 
 Me and class on the cell discussin' another deal 
 Gucci, Gucci bottle empty, daddy needs a refil 
 Up in freeway, I'm standin' on the bar 
 If it ain't a black truck, it's a quarter million maz 
 I'm in love with Kush and Kate Fox 
 If ya need anything hit the safe deposit box 
 Outta town for a month 
 Came home with a duff that was one point sumet 
 Pimp ask Khaled, lobster salad 
 Mobsta acknowledge, I'm poppin' them dollars 
 Pop colors, I touch hoes like crep flow 
 The game in a choke hold 
 No, I won't let go

 Well, I done said, said it before but I guess it best to repeat it 
 Dirty south in the building with no loses, we undefeated 
 Anybody think they can beat it must be on sherve 
 Got the streets on fire like Ross Kile with a perm 
 I'm big worm and that big body slaya 
 Rip it open and you keep playin' with my money 
 Smoke it like I'm a joke, I got for roke on a boulevard 
 In the paint an' have a bitch nigga sliced from his eyes to his tank 
 You think I came at 225 pounds of trouble 
 Can't find a trilla play then me if you had the Hubble 
 Been reppin' the dirty and I ain't finnin' to slow down 
 So if you ain't wid it, get out the way it's about to go down 
 You can get your issue like your ass subscribed 
 And when we ride there's nowhere that your ass can hide 
 Nigga, try to come at me, crocked like burner play craves 
 Have you runnin' up north like a runaway slave 
 Played pussy ya bluff even if it's ya period 
 The dirty south niggas take they money too serious, nigga
