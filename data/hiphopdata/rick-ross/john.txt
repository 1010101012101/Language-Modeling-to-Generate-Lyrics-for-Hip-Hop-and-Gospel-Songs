(Verse 1 - Lil Wayne) 
 .44 bulldog, my motherfucking pet 
 I point it at you and tell that motherfucker fetch 
 I'm fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck 
 I get pussy, mouth, and ass, call that bitch triple threat 
 When I was in jail she let me call her collect 
 But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death 
 Top down, it's upset 
 Been fucking the world and nigga and I ain't cum yet 
 You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck 
 The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet 
 The guns are drawn and I ain't talking about a sketch 
 I pay these niggas with a reality check 
 Prepare for the worst but still praying for the best 
 This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress 
 The money don't sleep, so Weezy can't rest 
 And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh 
 (Chorus - Rick Ross and Lil Wayne) 
 I'm not a star, somebody lied I got a chopper in the car 
 I got a chopper in the car 
 I got a chopper in the car 
 (Lil Wayne) 
 Yeah 
 Load up the choppers like it's December 31st 
 Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts 
 If I die today, remember me like John Lennon 
 Buried in Louis, I'm talking all brown linen, huh 
 (Verse 2 - Rick Ross) 
 Big black nigga, and an icy watch 
 Shoes on the coupe, bitch I got a Nike shop 
 Count the profits you could bring them in a Nike box 
 Grinding in my Jordans, kick them off they might high, swish! 
 I'm swimming in the yellow bitch 
 In the red 911 looking devilish 
 Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down 
 Thought he were bullet proof till he got hit the fifth time 
 Drop Palmolive in a nigga dope 
 Make it come back even harder than before 
 Baby I'm the only one that paid your car notes 
 Well connected, got killers off in Chicago 
 (Verse 3 - Lil Wayne) 
 Talk stupid get your head popped 
 I got that Esther, bitch I'm Red Fox 
 Big B's, Red Sox 
 I get money to kill time, dead clocks 
 You're fucking with a nigga who don't give a fuck 
 Empty the clip, then roll the window up 
 Pussy niggas sweet, you niggas Cinnabon 
 I'm in a red bitch, she say she going to cum 
 Two hundred thou' on a chain, I don't need a piece 
 That banana clip, let Chiquita speak 
 Dark shades, Eazy E. 
 Five letters, YMCMB 
 Bitch ass nigga, pussy ass nigga 
 I see you looking with your looking ass nigga 
 You don't know the rules, kill them all and keep moving 
 If I die today, it'd be a holiday 
 (Verse 4 - Rick Ross) 
 I'm not a star, somebody lied I got a chopper in the car 
 So don't make it come alive 
 Rip your ass apart than I put myself together 
 YMCMB, Double M, we rich forever 
 The bigger the bullet 
 The more that bitch going to bang 
 Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint 
 Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch 
 My first home invasion, pocket gain and forty bricks 
 Son of a bitch, than I made a great escape 
 Ain't it funny momma, only son be baking cakes 
 Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I'm Santa Claus 
 Niggas gather around, got gifts for each and all of y'all 
 Take it home and let it bubble that's the double up 
 If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up 
 It's a cold world, I need a bird to cuddle up 
 I call the plays, motherfucker huddle up 
 (Outro - Lil Wayne) 
 I'm not a star, somebody lied 
 I got a chopper in the car 
 Yeah
