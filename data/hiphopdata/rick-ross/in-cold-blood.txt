Run with me or run from me 
 Pussies don't get pussy 
 Yeah 
 I murdered all of my foes contract killing 
 Twenty k will get ya grandmamy pinned to the ceiling 
 Midst of the war I piss on graves 
 Kids get grazed by my piss poor ways 
 Never could imagine it livin' with paralysis 
 Shoulda check ya rearview made a better analysis 
 Wack yayo caught him slippin while he snort dust 
 Cold blood bullet hit him like a tour bus 
 Check the time on my movado my jazzy bitch a mulatto 
 With niggaz pay me the model 
 Swede louis on my feet still runnin' the street 
 And I never missed a heartbeat 
 Family over the money 
 Money over the bitches 
 Money don't mean nothin' 
 Then why they callin me riches 
 I'm addicted to watches 
 Mama tellin' me stop it 
 Got one over 50 
 50 you better watch it 
 Do him in cold blood 
 Look him in his eyes may do him with no gloves 
 Beat the case like orenthal (O.J.) 
 Above the law it's so hard to pin the big dog 
 Live on so I still ball 
 In my earliest convenience ima kill y'all 
 Make a lil cake haters wanna envy 
 God wanna see you niggaz in a bentley 
 Family over the money 
 Money over the bitches 
 Money don't mean nothin' 
 Then why they callin me riches 
 I'm addicted to watches 
 Mama tellin' me stop it 
 Got one over 50 
 And keep 50 in my pocket 
 Limousines for the don number three is the charm 
 Flee red carpet chillin' e on my arm 
 Purple rain smokin' head smokin' weed call it purple brain 
 I'm in the purple label daddy got a purple heart 
 Not in the service but I'm swervin in a purple car 
 Once the bitch need an oil change 
 I go and buy a new one 'cause I'm spoiled man 
 Family over the money 
 Money over the bitches 
 Money don't mean nothin' 
 Then why they callin me riches 
 I'm addicted to watches 
 Mama tellin' me stop it 
 You know I'm totin the rocket 
 So don't make a nigga pop it
