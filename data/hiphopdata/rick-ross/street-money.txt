(Feat. Flo Rida) 
 Yeah good looking E-Class, I needed that Nigga 
 What, Trilla, realer than fuck niggas 
 You know me, I walked up in the spot the babys be goin' crazy 
 While niggas steady tippin you know they got that 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 You know me, I stay up on my grind Like working that 9 to 5 plus hitting 
 That 95, I'm out to get that 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 I started flat broke, Now I'm poppin' rubber bands 
 I know I'm the shit, I done ate a ton of spam 
 If the club poppin', I'm a burn a ton of hundred grams check the parking 
 Lot pimpin', whip cost a hundred grand 
 I'm in love with shades, I got a thousand pairs 
 So that's free game, for all you thousandairs 
 It's funny sour d's will smell sweet 
 All these niggas think they sell them on Canal Street 
 I'm sittin' twelve feet 
 Fuck can you tell me, I let the 12's beat 
 Nightmare on Elm Street 
 So don't fall asleep, cause my life a dream 
 And they ain't gotta speak 
 They know I'm spittin' cheese 
 You know me, I walked up in the spot the babys be goin' crazy 
 While niggas steady tippin you know they got that 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 You know me, I stay up on my grind Like working that 9 to 5 plus hitting 
 That 95, I'm out to get that 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 We got them bottles poppin' soundin like they gun shots 
 Got the models balkin did all with one watch 
 I hit a lot markets, start' 'em off with one block 
 People love the product, so my people come to shop 
 My uncle 65 he still sellin dope, he claim he petryfied 
 The feel of goin' broke 
 It's them Caddy Sevilles 
 Went from acid and pills, to elaborate deals 
 If you want status you kill 
 Cause a habit for real 
 When I step in the spot, treat the club like the 
 Charts, I go straight to the top 
 They cost a stack, so don't step on the shoes 
 And ya know I'm strapped 
 I'm a play by the rules 
 You know me, I walked up in the spot the babys be goin' crazy 
 While niggas steady tippin you know they got that 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 You know me, I stay up on my grind Like working that 9 to 5 plus hitting 
 That 95, I'm out to get that 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 Take the good with the bad, In the club blowin' your last 
 Ballin like I violated, Bottles keep me hydrated 
 Party up in skyscrapers, Parachute to Prebate 
 Pistol like a paratrooper, tell'em take it easy 
 Bitch is bad as can be, this her fantttttasy 
 Left her panties at home 
 Standin there thick as can be 
 R- I- C- K R- O- S- S standin there dressed fresh 
 Gettin' pussy, Hell Yes 
 Ross, Ross 
 You know me, I walked up in the spot the babys be goin' crazy 
 While niggas steady tippin you know they got that 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 You know me, I stay up on my grind Like working that 9 to 5 plus hitting 
 That 95, I'm out to get that 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money 
 That Street Money, That street that street money
