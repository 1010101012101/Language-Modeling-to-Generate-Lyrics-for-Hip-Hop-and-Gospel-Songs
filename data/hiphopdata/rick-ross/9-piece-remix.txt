(Rick Ross - Chorus) 
 I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone 
 I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone 
 He wanna quote, he talking 9 zones 
 He bought four, I front him 5 more 
 9 piece, straight 8 balls 
 MJG bitch I got 8 balls 
 9 piece, straight 8 balls 
 MJG bitch I got 8 balls 
 (Rick Ross - Verse 1) 
 Suave house, still independent 
 Distribution Mexican 
 He still sending 
 No contract, take my word 
 Send a hundred packs bitch 
 Them my birds 
 Shoe box, no shoes in 'em 
 In the two seater, me and two women 
 No Def Jam, went solo 
 Took the custy's price so low 
 (Rick Ross - Chorus) 
 I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone 
 I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone 
 He wanna quote, he talking 9 zones 
 He bought four, I front him 5 more 
 9 piece, straight 8 balls 
 MJG bitch I got 8 balls 
 9 piece, straight 8 balls 
 MJG bitch I got 8 balls 
 (Lil Wayne - Verse 2) 
 It's Lil Tunechi 
 Wattup doe? 
 I'm talking white girl, Marilyn Monroe 
 And I can get 'em for the sweet sixteen 
 Hard dick, call it HD Flat screen 
 Get outta here, ? whip 
 You got a tan, look like a FLorida bitch 
 Automatic leave you dead in the living room 
 Get it? Leave 'em dead in the Living room 
 Call ? and tell him, to kiss my ass, 
 I put that ? to his head and tell him to have a glass 
 You mean I'm talking keys like Ray Charles 
 Rack 'em up, pool table full of 8 balls 
 Yeah 
 (Rick Chorus) 
 I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone 
 I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone 
 He wanna quote, he talking 9 zones 
 He bought four, I front him 5 more 
 9 piece, straight 8 balls 
 MJG bitch I got 8 balls 
 9 piece, straight 8 balls 
 MJG bitch I got 8 balls
