The meek shall inherit the earth 
 That's what the bible says 
 Walk like a giant, talk like a tyrant 
 Faith of a mustard seed, destined for a triumph 
 David and Goliath, hate me or admire 
 Kush burns slow as I chase my desires 
 Embrace my empire, batta boy eat fire 
 Guns like choirs when they sing, keep quite 
 Will I get to Heaven? Turn to Psalm 27 
 Lord knows when I see this monkey 
 I'm gon' be the devil 
 Be him 'cause I'm clever, beat him at whatever 
 You never was a G, nigga, Unit ain't together 
 New York's unified down south, love dat 
 When we get to shine, muthafuckas where the love at? 
 Real niggas gettin' money, betta log on 
 Think da games dead now? Imagine when ya dog's gone 
 Imagine when this song gone 
 When ya phone off, there's only one to call on 
 I mean if I die today 
 I could honestly say, thank you, Lord 
 Thank you, Lord, thank you, Lord 
 I'm bigger than a title, bigger than a name 
 You could label me the biggest title in the game 
 Put food on the table, fed the whole city 
 Tell me who be the fool if the Feds come get me 
 Better years are better when you call it trendsetter 
 The world so cold hope you got a lil' sweater 
 Caught a lil case but he had a lil' cheddar 
 Planned out the 15, poured his life in a letter 
 Very first line he called, trick daddy stupid 
 Say he got aids, tellin' people that it's lupus 
 Not the one just to jump to conclusions 
 I'm gettin' money, small talk can be a nuisance 
 Broke chains, reminiscent to them nooses 
 Sittin' on deuces, new land cruisers 
 Who the fuck you callin' losers, you niggas losin' 
 Look like you could use us 
 When I bought my first Run DMC vinyl 
 And my first 2 Live Crew cassette 
 I woulda cried if I knew I would be where I'm at today 
 Took me 40 minutes to walk there to buy it 
 Call ya boy, A C.O. but if I really was 
 When all these niggas undercover, fuckin' niggas up 
 Keep it trilla, nigga never had a gun and badge 
 Kept a nice, watch smokin' on a hundred sack 
 Back in the day, I sold crack for some nice kicks 
 Skippin' school, I saw my friend stabbed with a ice pick 
 Young nigga 15 with 3 C's 
 From that very day I carried on the 3 C's 
 Can't criticize niggas tryna get jobs 
 Better get smart, young brotha live yours 
 Only live once and I got 2 kids 
 And for me to feed them I get 2 gigs 
 I shuffle shit, I ceo so we can bow our head 
 And pray over the meatloaf 
 I'm lookin' at the big picture 
 Keep a bitch with cha, tryna get a bit richer 
 I remember prayin' for, for me to just get the 
 The opportunity to just get a record deal 
 And now I sign artists 
 Thank you, lord
