A month ago, I gave a chick a hundred stacks 
 Straight to Neiman Marcus, young b**** had a heart attack 
 Aw man, I love my b****es 
 Bottles, Beamers, Brand New Benz's 
 Barbies, ballerina's and Britney's 
 Barbera Streisand edition Bentleys 
 Bricks, big face hundreds in bundles 
 Boy, I'm a boss, I rose from the jungles 
 God forgives and these killers won't 
 In a room full of heathens, good n****s die alone 
 Better start taking notes as I'm taking tokes 
 The hood wanna see you die and they taking votes 
 My vision always mentioned coke 
 My women never sit in coach 
 Aww man, I love my b****es 
 Tongue kissin' a dark skinneded vixen 
 50, 60 racks, I might go blow 100 though 
 Jet owner, G5, where you wanna go? 
 F*** your ex's baby, really, that's your past? 
 Load up your carry-on's and all it is is cash 
 Aw man, I love my b****es 
 Aw man, I love my b****es 
 Aw man, I love my b****es 
 East coast to West coast, all my b****es 
 Tryna' bring you into my world, baby 
 Just stand there, You the canvas, I'mma paint the picture 
 You never met another n****, you know, f*** it, take it 
 Am I really just a narcissist 
 'Cause I wake up to a bowl of Lobster bisque? 
 And I wake up on some mobbin' s*** 
 With a great view and half my n****s swappin' bricks 
 It's just a way of life 
 For the king of diamonds, so I gotta stay tonight 
 50 cash in the Louis for the chicken wings 
 Started in a neighborhood and now we on to bigger things 
 Large clique of my constituents 
 Combination to the safe, straight to the Benjamins 
 Living life to the fullest was the emphasis 
 Making love to Mary J's "Reminisce" 
 It was all good just a week ago 
 Paper tag on the Panamera, my speakers blow 
 My b**** sittin' cute, she left her panties home 
 Suckin' the dick of the don, I'm talking Miami's own 
 Money like (LeBron James), money like (Dwyane Wade) 
 (Play it right) peelin' two off the dealership in the same day 
 (Say it right) paid like Mark Clayton, Mark Duper 
 Soon as n****'s start hatin', start shootin' 
 Come along, money longer than Olajuwan's 
 Lotta one's, all the b****es gotta model one's 
 Tongue pierced, dick sucked, said "I swallowed once" 
 50 million, I'm the only one that got it done 
 Aw man
