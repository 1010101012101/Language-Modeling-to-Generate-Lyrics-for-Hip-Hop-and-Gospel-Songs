I've been logging in my bed, crying till my eyes are red 
 We both said that things will change 
 But it's still the same shade of gray 
 I get mad you walk away 
 When it all just start to fade 
 I know you're fed up so am I 
 But we just can't say goodbye 
 Boy, you know I love you 
 But I just can't go on no more 
 Feelin' this way 
 You got me sayin' why, why, why? 
 Can't we get it right? 
 Just can't get it right 
 Don't know why, why, why? 
 Can't we get it right 
 No matter how hard we try 
 I got her looking at me sideways 
 Live every night like it's a Friday 
 My conversations are so monumental 
 Licking on her ear, I'm whispering a couple riddles 
 She fell in love with my technique 
 I made her call me boss when in the bedsheets 
 We both coming from the same place 
 All in her both coming at the same place 
 Still on my dope boy swag 
 Top down on my Cam'ron, Oh boy swag 
 Played the hand we were dealt from the beginning, baby 
 You the dealer, cut the deck, while we winning baby 
 You got me sayin' why, why, why? 
 Can't we get it right? 
 Just can't get it right 
 Don't know why, why, why? 
 Can't we get it right 
 No matter how hard we try 
 Can't we turn love around 
 We build it up to break it down 
 If you knew the way I feel 
 You would know that this love is real 
 But live in heaven, go to hell then 
 Go right back, across the lesson 
 Tired of stressin', get the message 
 I can't live in this depression no more 
 Boy, you know I love you 
 But I just can't go on feeling like this no more 
 You got me sayin' why, why, why? 
 Can't we get it right? 
 Just can't get it right 
 Don't know why, why, why? 
 Can't we get it right 
 No matter how hard we try 
 Back on my own again 
 I don't want this to end 
 But baby I need a friend to show me some more 
 And I think it should be you
