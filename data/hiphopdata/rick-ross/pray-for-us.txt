(Intro: Skit) 
 What is this? Maybach music 
 I like this Maybach music 
 Sweeeeeeeeeeet! 
 Ha-ha-ha! 
 (Verse 1: Skit) 
 Come on let's pray 
 Dear Lord 
 Please forgive us for all the sins we have brought upon us 
 And look down upon us with forgiveness for all the sins we will have in the future 
 I know you understand that niggas ain't perfect 
 But we try, Lord 
 We try to keep our heads up in bad times 
 This is a bad time 
 Show us the way 
 And if you can't show us the way 
 Then forgive us for being lost
