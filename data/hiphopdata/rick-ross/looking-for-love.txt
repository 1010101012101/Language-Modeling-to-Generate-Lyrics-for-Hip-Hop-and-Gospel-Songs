(Usher) 
 She say she looking for love 
 All the girls in the club 
 You know wats up 
 She say she undercover though 
 And this is what she wants 
 (Rick Ross) 
 Money making extraordinaire 
 It's my pedigree 
 Everyday reality is your wildest fantasy 
 She transitions from simple 
 Now she's sophisticated 
 Separated from bummy b-tches 
 She elevated 
 We celebratin' 
 My world forever blatant 
 Don't say a word we can make a statement 
 We makin' love, I'm talkin' face to face 
 We party hard, ciroc case for case 
 (Usher) 
 She wants the finer things and all that she can get from me 
 She even wants the lovely cutie on my arm 
 She get it in she all the way turned up 
 She (?) 
 She said she set the mood for love 
 Watch out that girl is trouble 
 They ain't got nothin' on her 
 Can't even fight her hunger 
 She a get it girl 
 Watch her do her thang 
 What she got she get from her mother 
 She super straight, her body shaped like no other 
 She's making her way to my area 
 When she gets past security 
 I say... hello 
 Welcome to my table 
 Bring your girlfriends, everything paid for 
 We goin' get it in, ain't that what you came for 
 Heard you was lookin' for me 
 She say she looking for love 
 Well all the girls in the club know wats up 
 She say she undercover though 
 And this is what she wants 
 (Rick Ross) 
 Lets make a movie 
 2 superstars 
 2 big body coupes, avatars 
 Them average n-ggas stay in the econo lodge 
 I stay at louie bedspreads, camouflage 
 Fluorescent lights 
 The best vodka 
 No tops, short bottles 
 Long legs, baby don't stop 
 You could bring a friend, baby she could watch

 Straight off the concourse 
 The cheers and encores 
 Nice sweat, she fiends for one boy 
 The innovator, young Sean Combs 
 Reminiscing me and Biggie bringing broads home 
 Father figure, hatin' for them mother niggas 
 Dirty money, went and bought a money printer 
 Now my money longer than the Mississippi river 
 Money makin' extraordinaire 
 I am the n-gga
