A nigga black, but he selling white 
 A nigga black, but he selling white 
 Wanna gain it all, but you gon' lose your life 
 A nigga black, but he selling white 
 A nigga black, but he selling white 
 Nigga crib so big it's a damn shame 
 Nigga's selling white for a gold chain 
 I've been trained to go since a young nigga stepped off the porch 
 Catch me in the kitchen, kilo, hey bring the fork 
 I've been trying to hold it down with these niggas living so foul 
 Grunting out on niggas intent of knocking ya down 
 Bang - your window shattered like it never mattered 
 You moving weight, your pockets getting fatter 
 It's politics when it come to sticks 
 See mass of blood, nigga want a brick 
 My money funny, but you gotta love it 
 High heel thugging in Magic City, these bitches fucking 
 Your homie doing tax since they call it fraud 
 I'm in and out of traffic, still moving hard 
 A nigga black, but he selling white 
 A nigga black, but he selling white 
 20 grand a night if you can get it right 
 A nigga sitting in the Benz and it's white on white 
 Take a look at me, I'm trapping 
 No excuses, I'm stacking, talking hundred on top of hundred 
 Them 100 making the magic blow 
 A hundred in a day, a hundred different ways 
 Rich nigga, bitch, put a hundred in my grave 
 Make my headstone read "head of MMG" 
 That's another hundred mill, really, you can come and see 
 Forbes dot com, I'm the Teflon Don 
 Too close to a nigga as a motherfucking bomb 
 Trayvon Martin, I'm never missing my target 
 Bitch niggas hating, tell me it's what I'm parking 
 Wingstop owner, lemme pepper aroma 
 Young, black nigga, barely got a diploma 
 A nigga black, but he selling white 
 A nigga black, but he selling white 
 20 grand a night if you can get it right 
 A nigga sitting in the Phantom and it's white on white 
 A nigga black, but he selling white 
 A nigga black, but he selling white 
 20 grand a night if you can get it right 
 A nigga sitting in the Benz and it's white on white 
 Showing 'til the day I die, I'm a look up at the sky 
 Young trap star, reap, the world is mine 
 Proceeding with my grind like police is on my line 
 Instagramming shit for all the teachers I despised 
 Never saw my vision, you only saw me suspended 
 Now my white bitches be fucking me 'til I'm windy 
 Breathe, breathe, young nigga, breathe 
 If your ass wasn't rapping, what would you be? 
 A nigga black, but he selling white 
 A nigga black, but he selling white 
 20 grand a night if you can get it right 
 A nigga sitting in the Benz and it's white on white
