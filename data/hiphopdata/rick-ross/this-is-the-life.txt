Billionaire yeah. You feel me?

 Rollin' them L's up [laugh]

 This Is The Life, This Is The Life 
 Keep shit poppin' these hoes they stay bobbin' no stoppin' us every night 
 This Is The Life, ain't no stoppin' 
 A love from watchin' boppers serve it up for a hell of a price 
 This Is The Life, This Is The Life 
 This Is The... This Is The Life. 
 Uh I'm the man you wanna stand near 
 Damn near a hundred gram in jewels in my stand smith 
 Snitches stand clear can't no snitches stand here 
 This reserve for the trill I'm red carpet every year 
 Take a picture canary stones so photogenic 
 No I didn't grow up with it so I had to go and get it 
 Started with a biscuit now I got a loaf 
 Hoes wanna slice I wanna tell her no 
 But I can't, I get a rush blowin' dough 
 I'm gettin' bank I'm in a rush to blow the dough 
 This Is The Life I'm in a race to get money 
 This Is The Life I need a bad bitch to blow it for me. 
 This Is The Life, This Is The Life 
 Ain't no stoppin' it's champagne for poppin' you draw from drivin' 
 This Is The Life, This Is The Life 
 Keep shit poppin' these hoes they stay bobbin' no stoppin' us every night 
 This Is The Life, ain't no stoppin' 
 A Love from watchin' boppers serve it up for a hell of a price

 Not that I'm arrogant, I'm just extravagant 
 For real, I'm a boss player check my lamineer 
 I got hoes in Memphis hoes in Maryland 
 White girl in Carolina let's call her Karoline 
 She love ballplayers hate the dope boys 
 'Cause we fight dogs call me Jeff Joyce 
 Yeah this the Superbowl of the street shit 
 It's all fast food my niggas eat quick 
 When I seen a million it fucked-up my life 
 Brand new 20 cars party for 20 nights 
 Fucked plenty wives crushed many lives 
 I wouldn't it change for the world 
 This Is The Life. 
 This Is The Life, This Is The Life 
 Ain't no stoppin' it's champagne for poppin' you draw from drivin' 
 This Is The Life, This Is The Life 
 Keep shit poppin' these hoes they stay bobbin' no stoppin' us every night 
 This Is The Life, ain't no stoppin' 
 A love from watchin' boppers serve it up for a hell of a price

 I'm camptin' in the Hampton's 
 Chillin' in a PlayStation, boss 
 'Cause I'm playin' with them chips that you ain't makin' 
 I ain't fakin' trap ain't fakin' 
 California razors keep me feelin' Jamaican 
 The block bakin' the blunt burnin' 
 I'm in Trump Towers amongst earners 
 Fine S sports for the S Service 
 Fine lip servers for the Triple C 
 Words rhymin' best 
 Can't spell well but I define success 
 I sell well so I make a toast 
 The fallen comrades hold the bottles up 
 We standin' tall fam. 
 This Is The Life, This Is The Life 
 Ain't no stoppin' it's champagne for poppin' you draw from drivin' 
 This Is The Life, This Is The Life 
 Keep shit poppin' these hoes they stay bobbin' no stoppin' us every night 
 This Is The Life, ain't no stoppin' 
 A love from watchin' boppers serve it up for a hell of a price 
 This Is The Life, This Is The Life 
 This Is The... This Is The Life.
