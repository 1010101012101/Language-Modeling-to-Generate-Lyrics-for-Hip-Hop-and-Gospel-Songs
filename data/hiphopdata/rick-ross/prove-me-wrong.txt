I am an arms dealer fitting you with weapons in the form of words 
 And (don't really care which side wins) 
 As long as the room keeps singing that's just the business I'm in 
 This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
 This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
 This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
 I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress 
 I'm the leading man 
 And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate 
 I'm the leading man 
 And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate 
 I wrote the gospel on giving up (and looking pretty sinking) 
 But the real bombshells have already sunk (primadonnas of the gutter) 
 At night we're painting your trash gold, while you sleep 
 Crashing not like hips or cars but more like p-p-p-parties 
 This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
 This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
 This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
 Bandwagon's full, please catch another 
 I'm the leading man 
 And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate 
 I'm the leading man 
 And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate 
 All the boys who the dancefloor didn't love, and all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough, sing, until your lungs give out 
 This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
 This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
 (Now You) 
 This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
 (Wear Out The Groove) 
 This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
 (Sing Out Loud) 
 This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
 (Oh, oh) 
 This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
 I'm the leading man 
 And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate 
 I'm the leading man 
 And the lies I weave are oh so intricate, oh so intricate
