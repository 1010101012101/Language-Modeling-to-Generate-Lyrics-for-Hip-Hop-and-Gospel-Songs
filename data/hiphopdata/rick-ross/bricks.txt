My attitude is fuck it, house biggest publics, 
 Shopping is a pleasure, pinky ring a nugget! 
 Niggas like to rise sip lean out the bucket, 
 I'll lean to the side, white whip michael douglas! 
 Hard times call for drastic measures, 
 I called my dog, he bought a mac-11... 
 Forty rounds holler'n where the yolla at?... 
 Nigga dead serious, choppa wit a shoulder strap... 
 Microphone, michael corleone, I know I'm wrong! 
 The man up above love for me to sing them palms, 
 So sing along, you know the song I sing, 
 Bring them things along, 
 I gotta feed the team. 
 Its ROZAY! 
 I need a hundred bottles, yellow bitches, all of 'em swallow, 
 H-Town, nigga 305 
 I can move them packs, each and every night.
