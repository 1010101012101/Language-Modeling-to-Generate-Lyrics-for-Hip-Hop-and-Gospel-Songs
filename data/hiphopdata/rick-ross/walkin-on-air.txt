I pray we all live forever 
 I pray I'm a servant to all prophets 
 May I be rich forever 
 Money on my head, pussy, boy, that ain't enough 
 Pull up to your trap strapped in my armored truck 
 Your mami house next, tell that bitch to duck 
 Ain't no sympathying in the city streets 
 That's all I ever heard from my older G's 
 She say she love me, but I know she play for keeps 
 Slip a black snake in a nigga's sheets 
 Bought a bitch a hundred acres, all red roses 
 Half you niggas Judas, I'm the son of Moses 
 Illuminated, resurrected as Selassie 
 Bob Marley through the trumpets on the day I die 
 Rolls Royces on dirt roads, we dopeboys 
 Baptized by the dopeboys, ordained by the assholes 
 My salvation is the cash flow 
 Whoa, oh 
 I'm walking on air 
 I'm talking big, bitch, I'm talking big 
 I'm talking big, bitch, I'm talking big 
 We do it big, bitch, we do it big 
 I'm into fashion, nigga, John the Baptist 
 My loyalty respected all across the atlas 
 I can have you and your team finalized 
 All your kids screaming at Mount Sinai 
 Holy Ghost, the divine spirit 
 My heart pure, he a real nigga 
 She let me fuck early so she trustworthy 
 Her pussy sacred so she getting all the purses 
 In his name I'm Supreme Lord 
 The Book of Leviticus is the springboard 
 Jesus Christ, look at this nigga's ice 
 Better yet, look at this nigga's life 
 I'm walking on air 
 You already know, I give and go and I get that dope 
 Nigga with that O, I move that shit like tic-tac-toe 
 And these be niggas hating like 
 Meek Mill, how you get that ho? 
 'Cause I get that dough, and I switch that flow 
 Just check my style, look at that Ro', on my wrist 
 On some shit, make a call, "Who is this?" 
 Think it's Benji on the line and he called, tried to flip 
 What I do? Make a call, call Papi for a brick 
 And papi call José, cause José got fish 
 Now I'm 30,000 feet up with my feet up, rollin' weed up 
 Pussy niggas couldn't bluff us, couldn't beat us 
 Throwing curveballs in the field get you hit like Derek Jeter 
 Double M, yeah that's the team, I know they see us, yeah 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute 
 Wait a minute, wait a minute 
 I'm talking big, bitch, I'm talking big 
 I'm talking big, bitch, I'm talking big 
 We do it big, bitch, we do it big 
 Fuck a tutor, better get a shooter 
 Teach your ass a lesson when they running to ya 
 Fiends lining up like we having communions 
 This my daily bread and you niggas consumers 
 All I ever wanted was to make scrilla 
 Have a recording session with J Dilla 
 Selassie, Exodus 
 Corinthians, Leviticus 
 I'm on the books, I study well 
 Getting money, bitches know me well 
 Selassie 
 Selassie 
 Pray I never die 
 Pray I never die
