(Intro: Rick Ross) 
 God forgives, He's so honorable 
 But living amongst thieves and niggas like myself 
 You will not have that luxury 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 I wake up excited, I made it through the night 
 Things I did in the dark, will it ever see the light? 
 My nerves should be a wreck, I got a bad chick 
 She keeps me erect, she loves my ad-libs 
 I think I'm a genius, hundred grand a fucking feature 
 I do at least three a week, roll up the fucking reefer 
 Went from Benihana to Bimini in Bahamas 
 Ten chains, no luggage, I'm a big timer 
 Niggas claim that they thugging when they dick-riding 
 My niggas rather walk, do they own brick climbing 
 On the block in my all white sneakers 
 Lord knows that my ten Jesus pieces 
 Pray for me cause you know a nigga doing wrong 
 My homie in the cell, so I had to write a poem 
 Count mills for the times that we had it hard 
 Asking for a hundred mill as I pray to God 
 (Hook: Rick Ross) 
 I do this for my niggas facing hard times 
 Can't be on them corners if you hustling part time 
 Ten chains on, Eric B with mob ties 
 Rakim flows, coming from the Pharcyde 
 Blood diamonds and my pieces from apartheid 
 Quick to quote a prayer, pull it from the archives 
 I pray for every soul that this music reaches 
 Bury me a G, ten Jesus pieces 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ross) 
 Young nigga coming up, they wanna gun you down 
 Drinking vodka in the memory of my nigga, damn (I miss you Peanut) 
 Riding real slow on them all golds (we had them nigga) 
 Shopping for them Os when the mall close 
 Repping for your homies when they all gone 
 Get empowered then you put your dog on (Real shit) 
 All black tees, ten gold chains 
 At the Super Bowl, but we in the dope game 
 Ten years strong in the same trap 
 Ten years blowing on that strong pack 
 Lord knows that I wanna live right 
 But Lord knows what that Club Liv like (right) 
 Forty dollar tab meaning forty grand 
 Lil Wodie got it rolled up in a rubber band 
 Holding on the forty in his other hand 
 Ten chains on, smoking in the motherland 
 (Verse 3: Rick Ross) 
 I'm his poltergeist, niggas know I'm more than nice 
 All these jewels on, all Moissanites 
 I could see it in the sparkle cause it lackluster 
 Black card maxed out, damn black brother 
 White collar, black minded 
 Chrome Smith and Wesson, back pocket 
 Eight shot, bitch I'm a top shotta 
 Screaming your affiliations, but that don't matter 
 I'm flyin' first class as the snakes slither 
 Never blackmail a motherfucking killer 
 On trial and they wanna execute me 
 It's really sad, just the fact they never knew me 
 True G to the core, feel my texture 
 A true G keeps it raw in his lecture 
 Keep it simple, white tee, new sneakers 
 Dope boy style, ten Jesus pieces 
 (Verse 4: Stalley) 
 Versace shirt, Jesus laying on the chest 
 Man I swear Big did it the best, I mean 
 Nas did it fresh, Jay did it fresh, I mean 
 Ye did it fresh, but man Big did it the best 
 And I was so impressed that I went and got ten 
 Now I'm stunting on these niggas 'cause I couldn't back then 
 Rose gold, yellow gold, a couple platinum 
 And I wear them all at once, I ain't trying to match them 
 I remember bumping Mac 10 and that deuce in the corner 
 Scraping up for a sandwich and a soda 
 Now my strength is up and I'm dangling chains off my shoulders 
 But no Jesus piece on mine, cause at times I feel ashamed 
 For the reason that I rhyme 
 And they say, because I'm Muslim I shouldn't think about the shine 
 Or even put it in a rhyme 
 It's better things I could talk about or put my money towards 
 But for now, I'mma wear these ten chains and floss 
 (Outro: Rick Ross) 
 We untouchable 
 (A man speaking in Wolof)

 Mi historia es complicada, pero al final del dia valio la pena, porque ahora estoy trabajando con el jefe 
 Yo vivi en Colombia y vivi muchas cosas, me entiende? 
 Vi muertes... vi muertes... vi cuerpos en las calles, sangrando despues del colegio, con 12, 13 a√±os viendo estas cosas en la calle 
 Y siempre queria venir para aqui otra vez, y me vine, y trabaje porque tenia otra mentalidad. Y cuando llegue aca entendi mi proposito: hacer dinero, ser rico para siempre 
 Dios perdona, yo no
