It's snow for side, I know it's your part 
 Well acquainted with all the modge and all that shit 
 It's Ricky Ro$$ the rich boss. 
 Wet bars on the boat 
 Wet broad money low 
 Real like Scott storch off from the coke 
 Maybach's were a dream, now it's all real 
 It's hard to get sleep layin' next to 5 mil 
 Still get the chills I call 'em the goosebumps 
 Yeah, Alex had a vision I'm buildin' like 2 trumps 
 Step in goosebumps I'm the main event 
 Got a pocket full of game bring the main intent (Ro$$) 
 6 bitches numbers on the same napkin 
 Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction. 
 You see it? These niggas livin' off the pad 
 Yeah I ran 100 miles but I did it all with class 
 Hands all glass, wrists all glass 
 Real on heron. How long will the crystal last? 
 Champagne to poar celebrate the cause 
 Hover above the law at the mercy of the lawyers. 
 (Hook: Rick Ro$$)

 What's worst a testimony from your homey 
 Tables turn quick I told you not to fuck with tony 
 You started with the dishes then it went to digits 
 I had to cross friendships it's rules to the business (Damn) 
 All the time with a sister like gina 
 Beauty salon dream got the keys in the beemer 
 On the way to cheaters pointin' an army 
 Land my spaceship with the spoilers on it 
 Seen the UFO's, FBI, ATF let 'em know how a nigga ride 
 .44 with .45's & .64's 
 Half a pill 2 dimes 6 folks 
 I need a slice of the pie 
 4 5 6 as I throw the dice in the sky 
 Head crack nigga, bread stacks nigga 
 Convertible purp yeah I let my hat back nigga.

 Lamborghinis and mazerattis for mediocrhes 
 When the lease over back to the streets soldier 
 Call cold shoulder Mike make me bring the heats over 
 When the beat's over mike see the peach rovas 
 We the eats while we tryin' to reach each quota 
 No soda rolls rolla one owner 
 Broad yayo 80 grand one corner 
 Luis vuitton right size don't want 'em 
 They trippin' I'm trippin' in Tiffany stones 
 Get a mop peter prop I'm livin' it homes 
 Cheufer I blow purp and no skirts 
 4 chains will put you down with more work.
