Girl 
 Girl 
 Come, baby 
 Come and get all my loving 
 Breathe it in with me 
 Let it get to yo head then get to Mars 
 Let it get to yo head then get to Mars 
 I wanna watch you take it in 
 I'm so high 
 I'm wasted, I don't wanna come down 
 Let me take you to Mars, girl 
 We'll make love on a star, girl 
 I don't wanna talk 
 I don't wanna think 
 I'm up here waiting for you 
 I'm so high, high, high 
 You taste so pure, you see something working out, baby 
 My eyes must be clouded, purple haze 
 Reach in time to touch you 
 With you in heave all night long 
 You're my fallen angel and I'm here to take you home 
 I'm so high 
 I'm wasted, I don't wanna come down 
 Let me take you to Mars, girl 
 We'll make love on a star, girl 
 She's such a centerfold, you other chicks just run along 
 She shoot on crys, yo Loubuittons, she will put it on 
 No logos on the bag if she got in on the arm 
 All she talk is swag and you know she put it on 
 On those cold nights fat boy had to keep her warm 
 Kept a paintbrush, studying The Art of War 
 Mr. Brainwash into my favorite song 
 I run with cash money but you know my money long 
 I'm so high 
 I'm wasted, I don't wanna come down 
 Let me take you to Mars, girl 
 We'll make love on a star, girl 
 I don't wanna talk 
 I don't wanna think 
 I'm up here waiting for you 
 I'm so high, high, high
