 Livin' this fast life

 Took her from Atlanta 
 To the condo on the beach 
 All she needs 
 A-a-a-all she needs 
 Is a boss on my level

 All I fiend is a queen in my presence 
 I can hold her till I die 
 Couple G's in a bezzle

 Still runnin' the streets 'cause every day I'm hustlin' 
 Double mg winnin' in the streets is lovin' it 
 All this paper comin' 
 And my baby touchin' it 
 I pinned her to the wall 
 You know this boy be bustin' it 
 Fur coast in the winter 
 Look like a polar bear 
 Stuntin' in the snow 
 These haters, they can go somewhere 
 Indoor pool 
 Outdoor pool 
 Indoor pool 
 Talkin' Ray J moves 
 7 rolls royces 
 Pink slips like a boss 
 Champagne on her body 
 Time to lick it off 
 Me and baby girl are winning combination 
 Ownership is my conversation 
 I'm a boss
