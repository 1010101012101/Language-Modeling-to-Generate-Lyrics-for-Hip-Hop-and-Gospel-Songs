Smokin' a fat splif in a brand new benz 
 No ID on da track let the story begin, 
 Lookin' in the mirror but I don't see much, Still runnin' the streets so I don't sleep much, 
 Watchin the snakes so they don't creep up, But the way I'm gettin' this money niggas can't keep up, 
 You niggas can't keep up, Niggas got beef but it can't be much, 
 I'm still walkin' through the crowds like I can't be touched, 
 Top back, all black, Gretsky puck, 
 Ice skater lil later might let me fuck, 
 Dang, she might let me fuck, 
 Last night I cried tears of joy, What did I do to deserve this, 
 Vocca Ron on my wrist, a year ago I didn't even know the bithes exist, 
 Quarter Milli for the muthafucka, No insurance on the muthafucka, 
 Ain't life a bitch, But you gotta keep her wet, 
 Keys open doors so I gotta keep a set, 
 Everybody know that Imma lotta people threat, Biggie Smalls in the flesh, 
 Livin' Life after my death, 
 Yesterday I read my horoscope, Tell me lord will I be poor and broke, 
 Tell me lord will I be dealin' dope, 
 I wanna take my momma to the poconos 
 (Ceelo) chorus 
 Whhhhy 
 (Rick ross) 
 But only lords knows 
 (Ceelo) 
 To all the love ones I leave behind 
 At least they can't see me cry 
 N I ask wen sum1 wants to be me why????????? 
 Thought havin' everything would ease my mind 
 But if you kuld read my mind 
 My god I'm scarred 
 I have tattoo tears of joy 
 (Rick ross) verse 2 
 Last night I cried tears of joy 
 What did I do to deserve this 
 Young rich muthafucka still uneducated but dammit a nigga made it 
 God damn a nigga made it, house bigger than a church lord knows I'm blessed 
 Five different lawyers lord knows I'm stressed 
 A punch in the face get you 300k 
 Ask vlad now he back to makin' minimum wage 
 Another victim of my criminal ways 
 I wanna walk in the image of Christ 
 But that bitch vivica nice 
 And I'm still swimming in ice 
 I'm just living my life 
 I'm just living my life 
 Lease a lambourghini for your pussy rate 
 Life is just a pussy race 
 Snatch a bitch take her back to your place 
 Next morning I kan tell you how the pussy taste 
 I got expensive taste 
 (Ceelo) chorus 
 Whhhhy 
 To all the love ones I leave behind 
 At least they kant c me cry 
 N I ask wen sum1 wants to be me y????????? 
 Thought havin' everything would ease my mind 
 But if you kuld read my mind 
 My god I'm scarred 
 I have tattoo tears of joy 
 (Rick ross) verse 3 
 Last night I cried tears of joy 
 What did we do to deserve this 
 Not to dwell on the the past but to keep it real I gotta represent for emmett till 
 All the dead souls in the field 
 Lookin' at my rolly its about that time 
 White man had a problem wit mine 
 N we suppose to be shy???(shy) (shy) 
 The revolutions televised, 
 Bobby still on the rise 
 (Ceelo) chorus 
 Whhhhy 
 To all the love ones I leave behind 
 At least they kant c me cry 
 N I ask wen sum1 wants to be me y????????? 
 Thought havin' everything would ease my mind 
 But if you kuld read my mind 
 My god I'm scarred 
 I have tattoo tears of joy
