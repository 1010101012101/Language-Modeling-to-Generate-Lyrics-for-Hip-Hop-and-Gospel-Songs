 Middle East women and Middle East bread 
 I got Oil Well money in the desert playing Golf 
 Don't ? with a Louis Scarf 
 Chest cold diamonds make a wanna cough 
 In Dubai 20 million on a few lofts

 The way I make the people wanna sing the hook in Arabic 
 Seven Star Hotels, Maybach, Movies 
 Sick big, knock camel toe 
 Women walking around while security on camel back 
 Club on fire now, dunno how to act 
 Sitting in casino's while I'm gambling with Arabs 
 Money so long watch me purchase pieces of the Almanac
