Hell, I want to show how you all look like beautiful stars tonight 
 You've got to feel it 
 Aw, you soundin' good 
 They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives 
 But we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight 
 And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit for the rest of our lives 
 So live fast and die young 
 Live fast and die young 
 Live fast and die young 
 Livin' fast, now it's all in the rags 
 Hard-headed, but my top peelin' back 
 Tinted glass on my '57, nigga with a attitude 
 Me, young and radical, methods are mathematical 
 Let my convertible marinate on the avenue 
 Mami, that's half a million, I'm livin' la vida rapido 
 Die young, but fuck it, we flew first class 
 Turned you to a rich bitch by your first glass 
 Up in this bitch and we lit up like a screen 
 Every time we hit the charts, niggas shoot up like a fiend 
 Stuntin' like we printin' money with machines 
 What you see me wavin', Vacheron Constantin 
 Like Mike, my Spikes stay all white 
 24 karat gold, eighty carats worth of ice 
 Ice insured, fuck life insurance 
 I live for the moment, and put a bullet on that 
 Ross got the club rockin' like a fuckin' boat 
 I'm the pirate on this ship, all you mates got to go 
 Good party over here, everybody over here 
 You know the word travel fast, everybody know we here 
 All the bottles over here, even spread it over there 
 All the models over here, but they swallow everywhere 
 She came to party like it's 1999 
 If she died on my dick, she would live through my rhymes 
 They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives 
 But we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight 
 And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit for the rest of our lives 
 So live fast and die young 
 Live fast and die young 
 Live fast and die young 
 For all my young ladies that drivin' Miss Daisy 
 Drivin' me crazy, rock the beat, baby 
 I'm about to err, she eat up the pavement 
 I don't give a err, baby, he crazy 
 I'm back by unpopular demand 
 Least he's still poppin' in Japan, shoppin' in Milan 
 Hoppin' out the van, screams from the fans 
 "Jeezy, always knew you'd be on top again!" 
 And we 'bout to hit Jacob the Jeweler 
 So I can be like Slick Rick, and rule ya 
 Dr. Martin Louis the King, Junior 
 And I'ma never let the dream turn to Krueger's 
 My outfit's so disrespectful 
 You can go 'head and sneeze 'cause my presence blessed you 
 I mean, we walked in this bitch so stylish 
 Niggas done mistook me for my stylist 
 And I know it's superficial and you say it's just clothes 
 But we shoppin' in that motherfucker, and it just closed 
 So go ahead and just pose 
 When she walked up out the dressing room, the store just froze 
 And I know they tryna get they cool back 
 And them ghetto bitches hollin' "How you do that?" 
 So they could never say we never lived it 
 And if I see Biggie tonight, I loved every minute 
 They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives 
 But we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight 
 And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit for the rest of our lives 
 So live fast and die young 
 Live fast and die young 
 Live fast and die young 
 Peter Piper pickin' peppers, Rick pitch poems 
 My leather long enough to keep a thick bitch warm 
 When that ass is enormous, abs abnormal 
 And tans in the morning on sands in California 
 Seems like we gettin' money for the wrong things 
 Look around, Maseratis for the whole team 
 Look at Haiti, children dyin' round the clock, nigga 
 I sent a hundred grand, but that's a decent watch, nigga 
 I'm gettin' better, 'cause it would at least have dropped, nigga 
 I'ma get my money right, just watch, nigga 
 She had a miscarriage, I couldn't cry, though 
 'Cause you and I know she was only my side ho 
 Uh, I got 'em catchin' amnesia 
 Time to pull my fuckin' minks out the freezer 
 See the lynx and you just think, "Jesus" 
 I'm hot 'til the day a day freezes 
 Young and radical, methods are mathematical 
 I'm multiplyin' my money through different avenues 
 Took many to war, shook never before 
 For my mother I applaud Ms. Afeni Shakur 
 Ice insured, fuck life insurance 
 Three bad bitches, it don't come concurrent 
 Still, you know the dope won't stop 
 And if I die today bury me in a dope-ass watch 
 They say we can't be livin' like this for the rest of our lives 
 But we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight 
 And you know they gon' be bangin' this shit for the rest of our lives 
 So live fast and die young 
 Live fast and die young 
 Live fast and die young
