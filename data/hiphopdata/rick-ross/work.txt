Rolling, we're rolling! 
 Yeah! 
 Riding with the stick, puffing on the purp 
 Overtime on you niggas, going to work! 
 I'm going to work, I'm going to work 
 Overtime on you niggas 'cause I'm going to work 
 I'm gonna get it any means necessary 
 'Cause you know I'm 'bout my paper like a secretary 
 I'm going to work I'm going to work I'm going to work 
 Gotta go to court tomorrow, DA on my dick 
 So I'mma wear my Audemar, just to make her sick 
 I might go yellow prezi on her, just to make her pissed 
 Then go home and break a brick and break it down to bacon bits 
 I'm going to work I'm going to work 
 The phone's popping, like we on the first 
 We up in Neiman's, we going berserk 
 A nigga cross me, he going to church 
 Ridin' through the hood, back of the 'Bach 
 Started in the front, now they in back of the back 
 No love for the haters, no rap for the rats 
 Velcro shorty, we strapper than strapped, work 
 Half you niggas telling so we never sell 'em work 
 They don't wanna come and get it then we mail 'em work 
 Put my money in it so you know it better work 
 And my shooters with me so you know they put it work 
 I might go buy a boat tomorrow, just to take a trip 
 Big belly rude boy, bad Jamaican bitch 
 Or head straight to Colombia, I'm talking Bogot√° 
 Ship 'em up to Philly, Milly living like he Gorbachev 
 Not the Reagen Era but a nigga making cheddar 
 ? And I'm never telling 
 The game sweet soda, seats watermelon 
 Clip full of sunflower seeds in my Mac-11 
 And I study motherfuckers like a student felon 
 Book bags full of blocks and those bitches selling 
 I'm going to work I'm going to work 
 I'm going to work I'm going to work 
 Got some youngins that'll murder for a new bike 
 Have you looking like you're fresh up out a food fight 
 Spaghetti on your head, shirt ketchup red 
 Shooting banana clips, we ain't ever scared 
 Niggas say they looking for me, they ain't ever there 
 I'm like a Metro Phone Store 'cause I'm everywhere 
 I'm gone get it any means necessary 
 'Cause you know I'm 'bout my paper like a secretary 
 Gave my nigga fifty years, forever buried 
 He said he gon' make it home like he never worried 
 Free my homie Rick, and free the homie Brick 
 Doin' hard time, love the 36 
 Tried to get her number, shorty she ain't know me then 
 She wanna fuck me now, I'm like you dirty bitch 
 Rookie of the year, 'cause I murder shit 
 In them way back, 'cause it's Maybach
