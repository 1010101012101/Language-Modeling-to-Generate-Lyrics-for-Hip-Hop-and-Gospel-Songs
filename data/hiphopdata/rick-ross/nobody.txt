You wanted to fucking walk around these roaches 
 These niggas is roaches 
 These niggas is mere motherfuckin' mortals 
 I'm tryna push you to supreme being 
 You don't wanna motherfuckin' 
 You don't wanna embrace your destiny 
 You wanna get by 
 You don't wanna go into the motherfuckin' dark 
 Where it's lonely 
 You can't handle the motherfuckin', the pain 
 Of the motherfuckin' not knowin' when the shit is gonna stop 
 Mama's trying to save me 
 But she don't know I'm trying to save her 
 Man, them niggas tried to play me 
 Man, till I got this paper 
 You're nobody till somebody kills you 
 "Blast for me" - the last words from my nigga 
 On the pavement, born killers, body shivers 
 Drug money, dollar figures 
 Hustlers moving out of rentals 
 All the war is mental 
 Having sushi down in Nobu 
 Strapped like an Afghan soldier 
 Nowhere to go to so it's bang 
 No survivors, only riders on my rider 
 Murder rate rises, stalking niggas on their IG's 
 Never IB, still solo, underarm is still Polo 
 No wire, on fire 
 My desire for fine things made me a liar 
 A shooter, getting high feeling like it's voodoo 
 Nine lives, SK with the cooler 
 Makaveli in the 'Rari, still B-I double G, I, E 
 I pray you smoke with me 
 Go to bed with a kilo like a c-note 
 Janet Reno, we all we got the creed to Nino 
 Pretty cars in the driveway 
 If you cut it then you sideways 
 Double up, crime pays 
 Mama's trying to save me 
 But she don't know I'm trying to save her 
 Man, them niggas tried to play me 
 Man, till I got this paper 
 You're nobody till somebody kills you 
 You fucking wanna walk around with these niggas? 
 What the fuck is their culture? 
 Where the fuck is their souls at? 
 What defines you? 
 These niggas with these fucking silly looks on their faces 
 You wanna walk around with them or you wanna walk with God, nigga? 
 Make up your got damn mind 
 I'm from where the streets test you 
 Niggas mix business and pleasure 
 Where the cocaine measure 
 The narcotics is our product 
 The by-product, you walk up on me, I cock it 
 New Mercedes as it peels off 
 Nothing penetrates the steel doors 
 Gang signs, see 'em all 
 I said my prayer as I'm counting sheep 
 Never really athletic, but I play for keeps 
 Do you feel me? 
 The mortician, the morgue filling with more snitches 
 We kill 'em and taking their bitches, R.I.P 
 Chinchillas on a winter night 
 Black bottles when the feeling like you wanna know what winter's like 
 And I'm never on that tour bus 
 Just a decoy for niggas, the PJ's, there's two of us 
 Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy 
 My niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, make me filthy 
 Touch mine until you receive and kill 
 Like I'm knowing every heathen will 
 Closed the deal with Steven Hill 
 We Magic City of the networks 
 Cut a nigga cast off, how my nigga net works 
 Mama's trying to save me 
 But she don't know I'm trying to save her 
 Man, them niggas tried to play me 
 Man, till I got this paper 
 You're nobody till somebody kills you 
 Fuck you wanna talk about? 
 Fucking jewelries and Bentley's and Hublot's 
 And fucking art that niggas ain't got on their fucking walls 
 And fucking mansions niggas ain't got 
 Niggas can't even pay the IRS, let alone their fucking staff, nigga 
 You gotta tell the truth, man 
 The truth'll set you free, son 
 The truth will set you free
