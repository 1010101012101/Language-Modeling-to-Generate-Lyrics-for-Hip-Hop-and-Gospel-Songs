The summer's mine 
 The summer's mine 
 I'm buying ten bottles b-tch 
 And I'm on number nine 
 The summer's mine 
 The summer's mine 
 Everytime she see a new whip 
 She know it's one of mine 
 The summer's mine 
 New silver scaglietti 
 F-ck a ron don you n-ggas ain't ready 
 You nigg-s is petty 
 You nigg-s spaghetti 
 Bustin' yo meatball

 You n-ggas pathetic 
 Leave you paraphlegic 
 You throwin' up sets 
 But you really from Cleveland 
 Uh 
 F-ck boy (4x) uh 
 See I broke it down like a quarter key 
 B-tch I run the show

 This how you wanna live 
 This what you wanna drive 
 Be honest with yourself 
 I'm who you idolize 
 The summer's mine 
 The summer's mine 
 I'm buying ten bottles b-tch 
 And I'm on number nine 
 The summer's mine 
 The summer's mine 
 Everytime she see a new whip 
 She know it's one of mine 
 The summer's mine 
 The summer's mine 
 Everytime you look around

 Blowin' money fast, yellow maserati 
 Deadman walking, decomposing body

 The summer's mine 
 The summer's mine

 And I'm on number nine 
 The summer's mine 
 The summer's mine 
 Everytime she see a new whip 
 She know it's one of mine 
 The summer's mine 
 The summer's mine 
 Everytime you look around 
 They spinnin' one of mine
