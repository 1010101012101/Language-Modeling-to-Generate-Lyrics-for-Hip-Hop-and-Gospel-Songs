(Feat. jazze pha) 
 Woo woo 
 Hey hey 
 Baby look here we got florida gators 
 We got alligators 
 Ya hot baby ya hot 
 Shake it gurl 
 (Jazze pha:) 
 Shake it off 
 Let me see ya expertise 
 Striptease for a playa wit sum extra cheese 
 (Gurl:) 
 Break it off 
 Jus me an my home gurls 
 Send us a chueffer 
 We can come over 
 I did a show one night tore down the whole house 
 Wit a flow that will hold down the whole south 
 Shorty feelin' us and they want to roll out 
 She got a man so the plan is to hold out 
 I was coo wit it knew whut to do wit it 
 King size fit me plus 2 in it 
 That night it was packed tight 
 Bottles from tables, tables to flashlights 
 All I needed was a bad dime so I can fall in and out of love like I did last night 
 Come sleep in the street nigga that will change yo whole life jus give me a week wit her 
 U don't want to talk you jus wanna play 
 Come to my place and get bent out of shape 
 Friend in the benz wit the plates out of state 
 Come wit yo friends the chauffers on the way 
 Shed yo skin boy it's time to breathe that 1 bedroom shit it's time to leave 
 Jus smoke me like a pound of weed and I'll match the sweet least a thousand feet 
 Nobody party like we do 
 We do thug shit fuck being gq 
 Livin' life in a flashy way then you livin' like ross and jazze pha 
 I got to make my money she like it wit candles and cameras on 
 Bitch ya better move sumthin can't ya tell I wanna do sumthin 
 Back to the grind keep it clear we won't stop till we millionaires 
 Fuck around and get a million errors 
 For all this money that I'm reelin in 
 So calm loud things arms longer than yao mings 
 Shake it like you suppose to for a yung nigga from the old school
