Been intense since it all began 
 Don't ask me about it 'cause I got it 
 I work hard, yeah, I put work in 
 He shining up and I drive it 
 I ain't saying that I'm bragging, babe 
 I just like to celebrate my accolades 
 Push it to the limit like a big body Benz 
 Push it to the limit, push it, push it to the limit 
 Love saying how I feel about my life right now 
 My hair so high and I can't come down 
 So I'm high and I'm on it, on it 
 He feeling my persona trying to push up on me 
 I'm ready and willing and capable 
 So come get it, what are you waiting for? 
 'Cause I'll let it hit it, now watch it blow 
 Not finished with it, you see the smoke 
 Oh, what I could give you is almost perfect, babe 
 I ain't got no worries, look into my pain 
 If you want it, I got it 
 That body on me, I got it 
 Then wake up, I got it 
 Think heavily and I got it 
 Got this body on lock and we can take it there 
 Anything that you'd think off, I got it, got it, take it to the air 
 I got it, don't know if you've got it 
 Bottles on a few bodies, spending millions like you got it 
 Cause you may never get another night like this 
 So push it to the limit if you about to stack the limit 
 She knowing I'm the hottest, knowing I'm the biggest 
 Fuck being modest, I'm worth fifty million 
 Bricks on, can sign me, killed Carolina 
 Bulletproof coupes, silk-shirts designer 
 She wanted cappuccino so I bought the Starbucks 
 Two point four, that's off two notch road 
 Nickles on the corner, pickles in the salad 
 Pictures on the wall, chickens in the attic 
 Choppers in the Phantom, bezel's on the watches 
 Hate in your heart, really you the target 
 They say I'm hard to kill, there's money on my head (Let's make it right tonight) 
 Mastermind coming, still running from the fed 
 If you want it, I got it 
 That body on me, I got it 
 Then wake up, I got it 
 Think heavily and I got it 
 Got this body on lock and we can take it there 
 Anything that you'd think off, I got it, got it, take it to the air 
 I got it, don't know if you've got it 
 Bottles on a few bodies, spending millions like you got it 
 Cause you may never get another night like this 
 So push it to the limit if you about to stack the limit 
 If you on it like I'm on it then come on it, we gon' flaunt it 
 I'mma stand on top off the globe 
 I don't, I don't think you're ready, but this thing is dripping wet 
 Tell me what you trying to do 
 I could have you floating higher than what you got in that cup 
 I could tear that thing up, I could tear that thing up 
 Got you creeping up behind as you feeling up on mine 
 I wouldn't make it up 
 If you want it, I got it 
 That body on me, I got it 
 Then wake up, I got it 
 Think heavily and I got it 
 Got this body on lock and we can take it there 
 Anything that you'd think off, I got it, got it, take it to the air 
 I got it, don't know if you've got it 
 Bottles on a few bodies, spending millions like you got it 
 Cause you may never get another night like this 
 So push it to the limit if you about to stack the limit
