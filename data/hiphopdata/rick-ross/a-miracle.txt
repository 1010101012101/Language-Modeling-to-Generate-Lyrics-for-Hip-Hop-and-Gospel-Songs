Rick Ross: Trilla 
 Bird-man: brrrr! 
 (Webbie) 
 The 'lil soldier wit nothin' clear to see wasn't nobody handin' him shit 
 Ridin' round town glamor and glistenin' 
 Ya don't won't my position, I'm spittin' facts 
 Couldn't relax, the whole time I had weight up on my back 
 Be black goin' back, I got pistols on deck 
 They gave 'cause seven flat, how many niggas goin' rat 
 Check my tats, ya never heard of dis ya suppose to man 
 It had to fair, now I meet the family and them, it packed at Madison Square 
 I had career, I supposed to be right back there with them 
 I owed it to him, I know it I show it 
 Don't wanna blow it or pour it 
 For the streets, give me a beat I'm a roll it 
 Show it wit them, leavin' magic 
 But I knew I had it in savage 
 It got crucial I ain't panic, when y'all want it, I ran it 
 I remember when my granny said anything was to happen 
 From slangin', hustlin', to trappin' 
 Laugin', prayin', jackin' 
 I'm blowin' on granddaddy and all my kids happy it's a miracle 
 It seem like I'm dreamin', ah somebody pinch me 
 Am I supposed be in the spot that I'm in, is dis really real 
 All these years, am I really here 
 Have I really live what they call a miracle 
 (Birdman) 
 How you shoot clips, put it in the air 
 Mean mug them niggas and have no fear 
 Play the game wit them stripes, put it in his life 
 Ten on the mic, nigga do it the same night 
 It's a miracle, the way I bend them corners on them 
 Get up early on them, get dis money on them 
 A miracle, a lot I bought on, crib I paid on, thangs I got on 
 A miracle, fresh crush to diamond ice, place in one price, did it for one night 
 A miracle, I don't lived the high life 
 Shined in high lights, did it with gun fights 
 A miracle, nigga it was hell we came in 
 Money didn't come in, hell we went in 
 A miracle, no time lyin' homie 
 Time for crime homie, time for dyin' homie 
 (Rick Ross) 
 It's truly a miracle, that boy still a live 
 'Cause I was sellin' bo in '95 
 Ridin' wit my boys dealin' dope gettin' high 
 Crackers tryin' to give me time, and we ain't talkin' 5 
 Niggas talk fly so that pistol by my side 
 My baby mama fuckin', all my homies on the sly 
 I see all through the corner of nigga eyes 
 So I keep my shades on, and my face up at the sky 
 Pistons get the power, snitchin' is for cowards 
 I got plasmas in the shower, and my bitches snortin' powder 
 I'm a g, my life a movie, I got rubber Uzi's in my jacuzzi 
 They think I'm biggie, I'm bumpin' juicy wit several groupies 
 I got beamers and business, bitch they all on deuces 
 I got the product, and when ya drop it, it never loses 
 The prey get prayed on, killers get prayed for 
 It dis a dream, I pray I never wake up
