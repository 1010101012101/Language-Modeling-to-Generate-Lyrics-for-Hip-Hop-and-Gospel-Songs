This is for the soldiers the see the sun 
 At midnight, ya dig 
 Let me slow down (it's so incredible) 
 (Rick Ross) 
 I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga 
 Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas 
 We the lost symbols, speak in cryptic codes 
 Ancient wisdom, valuable like gifts of gold 
 I embark on life, my path is all math 
 I understand the codes these hackers can't crack 
 I understand that folks expect me to fold 
 Community control to violate parole 
 I won't fail, but a lot of men will 
 I'm iconic in the field, like Solomon's Seal 
 Uh, it's just an intro 
 Allow my flow time to sink into the temple 
 Free Mason, freelancer, free agents, we faster 
 Big contracts, big contractors 
 Built pyramids, period we masters 
 No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas 
 A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors 
 All white mansion, I'm the child of God 
 All black diamonds, times were hard 
 New Rolls Royce 
 Guess you made it, nigga 
 All white neighborhoods, you they favorite nigga 
 My top back like J.F.K. 
 They wanna push my top back like J.F.K. 
 So, so I J.F.K. 
 Join Forces with the kings and we ate all day 
 Right now I could rewrite history 
 I stopped writin so fuck it, I'll do it mentally 
 (Rick Ross and John Legend Chorus (x2)) 
 I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga 
 Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas 
 Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide 
 Multiplying and I pray to God we never die 
 (Jay-Z) 
 Niggas couldn't do nothing with me they put the devil on me 
 I would have preferred if niggas would squeeze the metal on me 
 Rumors of Lucifer, I don't know who to trust 
 Whole world want my demise, turn the music up 
 Here me clearly 
 If y'all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me 
 Fuck all these fairy tales, go to hell this is God engineering 
 This is a Hail Mary pass, y'all interfering 
 He without sin shall cast the first stone 
 So y'all look in the mirror, double check your appearance 
 Bitch I said I was amazing 
 Not that I'm a Mason 
 It's amazing that I made it through the maze that I was in 
 Lord forgive me I never would've made it without sin 
 Holy Water, my face in the basin 
 Diamonds in my rosary shows he forgave him 
 Bitch I'm red hot, I'm on my third six but the devil, I'm not 
 My Jesus piece flooded but thou shall not covet 
 Keep your eyes off my cupboard 
 I'm a bad motherfucker, it's Hov just say you love it 
 I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga 
 Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas 
 Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide 
 Multiplying and I pray to God we never die 
 (John Legend) 
 If I ever die, never let it be said I didn't win 
 Never, never say 
 Never say Legend didn't go in (Imma go in) 
 I just wanna die on top of the world 
 Makin' love to my favorite girl 
 I'm makin' beautiful music, we makin' a movie 
 We knew we was born to do it 
 I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga 
 Better behave, you're dealin' with some rich niggas 
 Started in the ghetto, now we worldwide 
 Multiplying and I pray to God we never die
