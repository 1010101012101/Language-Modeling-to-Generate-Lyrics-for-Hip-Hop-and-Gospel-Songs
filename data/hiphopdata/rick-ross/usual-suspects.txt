Maybach Music, it's deeper than the verse baby 
 It's deeper than the rap 
 Doin' a 150 miles and runnin' 
 Get up in the way then you know that I'm gunnin' 
 Laugh about the doe but really ain't nutin' funny 
 Gettin' rich in a rush 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 The real definition of success 
 Throwin' money 'cause I can and I love it 
 From nothin' to somethin' 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 You know the boys on the block wanna take us 
 'Cause we bringin' all of the paper and 
 From nothin' to somethin' 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 Seventeen, tryna man up 
 Feed the fam boy, I put that on these damn goods 
 All I got was diabetes and a damn ugg 
 People talkin' down, callin' me a damn sprug 
 Young niggas, all you wanna do is roam free 
 On your own feet, gotta cook your own beef 
 I'm too cool for lame dudes that ridicule 
 I laugh while I'm doin' laps in the swimmin' pool 
 I don't owe you niggas nothin' 
 Call me two fingers when you see a nigga stuntin' 
 Black Philip drummin', limousines of the Hummer 
 Penthouse sweet, pretty beach I call the summer 
 Lotta homies pass, see 'em in the future 
 Moneys so fast, on the gas, never neutral 
 Gotta keep a shooter while I'm ridin' in the seven 
 Higher than a kite by the time I get to heaven 
 Doin' a 150 miles and runnin' 
 Get up in the way then you know that I'm gunnin' 
 Laugh about the doe but really ain't nutin' funny 
 Gettin' rich in a rush 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 The real definition of success 
 Throwin' money 'cause I can and I love it 
 From nothin' to somethin' 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 You know the boys on the block wanna take us 
 'Cause we bringin' all of the paper and 
 From nothin' to somethin' 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 And still my talent is yet to be challenged 
 Had new jet with my own pilot 
 No blastin' off, but flexin' DJ Khaled 
 My mom stressin' college but my crude sense of logic 
 Did a lude to my empty wallet 
 Try spittin' on a green tinted Accord 
 Which could mean a sentence up north 
 Where the homie was but back then 
 Doe was like a hoard it goldie love, it didn't exist 
 And office foley cuffs was after my wrists 
 Was not Beverly hills where we chilled 
 Imagine this, the nas 'n' rith had to get from rags to rich 
 I used to stand on rooftops, with two glocks 
 Figurin' how do I turn my timbalands to clocks 
 Now reptiles was left out about a watch 
 What is you thinkin'? Murk you 
 Plus the muscle that you bringin' is nothin' to me 
 If you thuggin', a fake and shaked on Cuban, shout out my Ricans 
 Down with all of you gangstas to the roughest Jamiacans 
 Doin' a 150 miles and runnin' 
 Get up in the way then you know that I'm gunnin' 
 Laugh about the doe but really ain't nutin' funny 
 Gettin' rich in a rush 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 The real definition of success 
 Throwin' money 'cause I can and I love it 
 From nothin' to somethin' 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 You know the boys on the block wanna take us 
 'Cause we bringin' all of the paper and 
 From nothin' to somethin' 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 If you ballin' physics, nigga money never flow 
 Meanin' every day I'm livin', tryna stay on flow 
 Coming from a boss, I can predict a double cross 
 Handlers managin' money, they never come across 
 I spend in Africa, Magnamers, numbers involved 
 AK47s singin' win or by sum or you fall? 
 I dealt with brawls and those willin' to sell their soul 
 Over cars and clothes, man I'm talkin' petty hoes 
 Ask ma feddi grow, fuck a feet of spaghettio's 
 I'm club poppin' in Cali shout out to Ariel 
 Somebody dim the lights, triple black tuts 
 'Cause associated and the flesh is tryna catch up 
 I roam with niggas who destined to get a life sentence 
 Get their baby mama a Lexus for them nice visits 
 Ma nigga got a dub an' love to do the push ups 
 I got a million cash tryna get the kush up 
 Doin' a 150 miles and runnin' 
 Get up in the way then you know that I'm gunnin' 
 Laugh about the doe but really ain't nutin' funny 
 Gettin' rich in a rush 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 The real definition of success 
 Throwin' money 'cause I can and I love it 
 From nothin' to somethin' 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 You know the boys on the block wanna take us 
 'Cause we bringin' all of the paper and 
 From nothin' to somethin' 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 Doin' a 150 miles and runnin' 
 Get up in the way then you know that I'm gunnin' 
 Laugh about the doe but really ain't nutin' funny 
 Gettin' rich in a rush 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 The real definition of success 
 Throwin' money 'cause I can and I love it 
 From nothin' to somethin' 
 You know us we the usual suspects 
 You know the boys on the block wanna take us 
 'Cause we bringin' all of the paper and 
 From nothin' to somethin'
