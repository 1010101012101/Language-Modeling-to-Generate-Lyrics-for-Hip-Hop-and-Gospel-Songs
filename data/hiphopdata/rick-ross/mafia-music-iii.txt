My corner so polluted, young niggas looting 
 I studied Kenneth Williams, I'm one hell of a student 
 Remarkable hustle, my niggas coming home 
 I kept the candle lit, my nigga never rowed 
 Niggas caught him slipping, gave him a shit bag 
 Five shots to the stomach, 2Pac gift pack 
 It's death row, conspiracy theories 
 Concealed indictments handed to the grand jury 
 Get some money now, you hated by your own kind 
 The home invasion done by niggas in your bloodline 
 GABOS, game ain't based on sympathy 
 So he put a hit on his cousin at 18 
 A sweet potato pie, oh me, oh my 
 Showing no remorse watching the others cry 
 Heroin sales, detectives'll sell 
 A lot of yellow tape, where that Obama care? 
 This the mob, bitch, silk underwear 
 Yeezy concerts, Kim Instagrams 
 Niggas hating, though they studied my moves 
 I'm like Farrakhan, in view of hundreds of Jews 
 Two attempts on my life, they threatened venues 
 Can't you see what I am? The hustle continue 
 I bought more jewels, I ordered the Wraith 
 I got a new style of shoes, match the watch in the face 
 Bill Belichick, coaching and calling the shots 
 Throw a yellow flag, pussy nigga body drops 
 Then we celebrate, black bottles pop 
 Time to elevate, we re-open shop 
 Wale a genius, Meek Mill a superstar 
 My new crib in Phoenix, ten car garage 
 Petite felite, platinum Audemars 
 Ain't no tags needed, nigga, I own them cars 
 I know them bitches, we met them broads 
 Never loved one, fucked them all 
 I'm a fucking dog, Ricky fucking Ross 
 Nigga Birkin bags just for my runner-ups 
 But my main bitch she get the main dish 
 Not the old range, that was a lame bitch 
 Brazilian weave, she say I came quick 
 I let her see a hundred ki's, a different St. Nick 
 Moving bricks like it's Black Friday 
 She gotta fuck me or call me a fat crybaby 
 Looking over my shoulder, I can't trust a soul 
 Bought a spot in Anguilla just for me and my ho 
 Glock .40, even when I shower 
 Chrome .22 in my swimming towel 
 Mob ties and I pray the music set me free 
 May the powers that be, nigga let me be 
 We around when the sun goes down 
 And the real, real killers they mourn for ya 
 It's gonna be a bloodshed 
 One month, one day it's gonna be a bloodshed 
 Bop, gunshot in the head 
 Payback is a motherfucker 
 Yes, I feel it when I squeeze the trigger 
 I feel the air when my enemies die 
 I feel the strength of ten killas 
 What is to be, will be 
 Only God on earth can kill me 
 'Cause these fucking streets filthy 
 And I ain't fucking guilty 
 Gangsta no take no chance, from no guy 
 Know why? Violate a gangsta and bullets fly 
 Boy die 
 Guns go off ah suh me say 
 Murderings in anyway 
 Gangsta no take no chance, from no guy 
 Know why? Violate a gangsta and bullets fly 
 Boy die 
 Guns go off ah suh we say 
 Murderings in anyway 
 You better not be around, when the sun goes down 
 And the real real killas, them hunt for you 
 Ay, it's gonna be a bloodshed 
 One bust, one dead, it's gonna be a bloodshed 
 Gun shot in a head 
 Sizzla Kalonji have de girls dem screaming 
 Entire country every sweet gyal 
 Ya already know the meaning but its streaming 
 Go and clean, ya can't diss me ya must be dreaming 
 Jamaicans make dem know we can't defeat dem (Mo' fire)
