Trilla... 
 Boss 
 Yeah, Trilla, feels good baby 
 Boss 
 I done took over the game nigga 
 Hoppin' out the blue gotti with my belly's on 
 No underwear nigga, my jeans tight fitted to nigga 
 Jay-Z what up nigga'! 
 Uh, yeah 
 Let me fuck with 'em right now. 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ro$$) 
 Niggas want to kidnap, leave me in the trunk, walk away with big stacks 
 They jealous of the fortune, glitz and the fame my cocaine mortgage 
 In the game like Tony Parker, snow white range and my partner pocket 
 I'm back on them things that's my only problem, homey I put that on my only mama. 
 Still rollin' with the 4 5th now that I'm rich got these broke niggas so sick 
 And my daughters college prepaid, she straight, say thanks to the D game! 
 In that phantom on that 2Pac, Ridin' Through The Ghetto like I'm lookin' for a new spot, nawwt. 
 But I'm well established, I fuck with heroin 'cause it sells the fastest. 
 (Chorus: Rick Ro$$) 
 I'm a ride 'about mine & I wouldn't tell a lie 
 Take it out of town go and get my money right. 
 And if it ain't 'about cash, I don't really care 
 I'm straight 'about cash, I'm a hood Billionaire 
 I'm straight 'about cash, I'm a hood Billionaire 
 I'm straight 'about cash, I'm a hood Billionaire 
 If it ain't 'about cash I don't really care 
 I'm straight 'about cash 
 I'm a hood Billionaire. 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ro$$) 
 Uh, boss 
 A bitch try to stick me 
 Just 'cause you fuck me don't mean you can kiss me 
 Naw 
 I only fuck with the O.G.'s, the ones that won't turn you in to the police 
 On the run um through a nigga 4 keys 
 I.d.'s passports it was so sweet (they lookin' baby!) 
 Front yard still a car show, blue gotti, the gotti and my rocko 
 I won't let the roof up, Kingdom Come, prince is amoonda 
 To be loved, to be loved, oh what a feelin' for me to be loved 
 Haters want to murder me & I can smell a hit 
 So it's music to my ears every time I feel a clip (feel a clip) 
 I'm a card shark up in a hard rock, 20 grand a hand baby jam in the iPod. 
 (Chorus: Rick Ro$$) 
 I'm a ride 'about mine & I wouldn't tell a lie 
 Take it out of town go and get my money right. 
 And if it ain't 'about cash, I don't really care 
 I'm straight 'about cash, I'm a hood Billionaire 
 I'm straight 'about cash, I'm a hood Billionaire 
 I'm straight 'about cash, I'm a hood Billionaire 
 If it ain't 'about cash I don't really care 
 I'm straight 'about cash, 
 I'm a hood Billionaire. 
 (Verse 3: Rick Ro$$) 
 Boss 
 Hit a hundred grand in a day damn 
 Whip that white girl just like K-Fed 
 Got me a white girl, I fuck till her face red 
 Yeah her food tastes bad, but she givin' great head 
 Please let me say that, I really love a bad ass 
 Take her to the dealer ship and she can she can get that 
 My heart in the ghetto, I'm married to the projects 
 I ride with AR, incase a nigga start shit. 
 (Chorus: Rick Ro$$) 
 I'm a ride 'about mine & I wouldn't tell a lie 
 Take it out of town go and get my money right. 
 And if it ain't 'about cash, I don't really care 
 I'm straight 'about cash, I'm a hood Billionaire 
 I'm straight 'about cash, I'm a hood Billionaire 
 I'm straight 'about cash, I'm a hood Billionaire 
 If it ain't 'about cash I don't really care 
 I'm straight 'about cash, 
 I'm a hood Billionaire.
