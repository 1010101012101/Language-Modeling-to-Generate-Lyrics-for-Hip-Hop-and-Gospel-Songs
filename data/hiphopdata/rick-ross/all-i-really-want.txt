All I want 
 Every time I call, she just come 
 'Cause every time I call, she get to cum 
 Damn I'm in love again, look what this shit done 
 When I used to keep a roll of dem bitches like which one 
 (One, one) 
 (It's the boss) 
 (Radio killa) 
 It's not a dream, baby 
 (Radio killa, killa, killa) 
 Or is it a dream 
 She graduated from the school of arts 
 Now she swimming in a pool of sharks 
 Roughest niggas with the coolest cars 
 Sophmore year had her 1st minaj 
 Better DC like go barrack 
 Girl drunk it like a Fiji 
 And she blow my socks 
 Every night she comin' through 
 For me to fuck that 
 Found out she had a man, I holla fuck that 
 Better give dat boy a bus pass 
 I see no competition, baby girl, a must have 
 My letters hinted on my mustache 
 The remy never did it or did it 
 Make her bust fast 
 Good dick make a chick wanna cut class 
 The way I'm knockin' on the door 
 They call it trespass 
 She my dime not the one I wanna curse at 
 Lookin' fine real, diamonds on a cutglass 
 People call you blind 
 (People call you blind) 
 But all you need is me, girl 
 (All you need is me, girl) 
 Your all that's in my mind 
 (Ooh, yeah) 
 All you need is me girl 
 All a nigga really want is you 
 All a nigga want is you 
 All a nigga want is you 
 All a nigga want is you 
 All a nigga want is you 
 Who can hit it more faster 
 I'm talking authentic orgasms 
 Film that play it on a big plasma 
 Back to work juss a little bit faster 
 She say life is a journey 
 I need mine juss like my atourney 
 I get sued like a nigga switch shoes 
 Long money but he gotta a quick fuse 
 Ride slow but I'm in a quick car 
 Pause for a minute, paint em' in a picture 
 Baby girl, my money good 
 Who turned her on a nigga least kirk wood 
 Time to give that boy a bus pass 
 I see no competition, baby girl, a must have 
 She shines like a diamond 
 Motivation for my rhyming 
 People call you blind 
 (People call you blind) 
 But all you need is me, girl 
 (All you need is me, girl) 
 Your all that's in my mind 
 (Ooh, yeah) 
 All you need is me girl 
 All a nigga really want is you

 All a nigga want is you 
 Suede pea coat, with the Gucci trim 
 Knew it was him by the Gucci brim 
 We gotta do it B I G 
 I'm tryna hit the lottery in V I P 
 Green leafs in my shot glass 
 All night soul team had cirrock add 
 Ain't nothin' you can tell me 
 I'm on them hills, like I'm Jonathan Kelsy 
 Told her friends that she felt me 
 We made love through the love hate LP 
 She my Josephine Baker 
 May need morphine, the deeper that I take her 
 I'm a back breaker another tax bracket 
 Benz Maybacher, green bay packa 
 My life a movie so tonight 
 Is when I jack her 
 People call you blind 
 (People call you blind) 
 But all you need is me, girl 
 (All you need is me, girl) 
 Your all that's in my mind 
 (Ooh, yeah) 
 All you need is me girl
