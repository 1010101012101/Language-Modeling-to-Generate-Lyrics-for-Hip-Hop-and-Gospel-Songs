I wear the gun like a urdle 
 Bulletproof car got me feelin' like a turtle 
 Sheit these niggas ain't satisfied till they get murdered.

 I'm lookin' thug in the bentley, 
 I got a few slugs don't temp me 
 Tell em' put me up on the furmax 
 I'm a million dolla' nigga lets confirm that 
 I rep care city out in vegas 
 And a magic hundred thousand dolla bracelate 
 More guns than the matrix 
 Neo reload get ya face twist 
 Cartell cociane by the cases 
 Cocktail more cars than a racist 
 Ak's on the leer jet 
 Whoa... Rick Ross I'm a real threat
