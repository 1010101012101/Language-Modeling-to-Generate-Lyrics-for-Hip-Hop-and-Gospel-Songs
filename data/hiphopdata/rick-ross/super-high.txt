Uh... uh... uh 
 [Verse 1: Rick Ross] 
 From my nigga Diddy view, I think I see his vision too 
 Purple Rain, over Central Park, chillin' with my goons 
 Big Pop's & Sade's, Cirocs and Chardonnay 
 My Cassie's sassy, so my penthouse my balloon 
 We doin' it big, it's goin' down, 9/11 
 I'm doin' it big, pullin' up in a 911 
 I been tryna fuck for months, babygirl it's now or never 
 Got the condo on the beach, hope through our storms we shall weather 
 ...We shinin' when it's pitch dark 
 Yeah this bitch a movie, but this time I play a big part 
 Uh, fuck the marketing, look at what I'm accomplishin' 
 I'm beatin' niggas by margins bigger than Fran Tarkenton 
 [Chorus: Ne-Yo] 
 All these cars, all these stars, all around me (super high) 
 Put your eyes... to the sky, that's where you'll find meee (ooh ooh ooh) 
 'Cause we are... we are... super hiiiigh 
 Ooh yeah, ooh yeah 
 {Bring your sexy ass here baby} 
 [Verse 2: Rick Ross] 
 I wanna buy my bitch every bag 
 And she ain't ever, ever, ever gotta take 'em back 
 I wanna take my bitch around the globe 
 Hawaii, hand glidin' in the mountains, shittin' on these hoes 
 ...Rare bottoms by the barrel 
 Pop the Giuseppe tags, like it's American Apparel 
 20,000 up in Barneys, haters'll never harm me 
 Rick Owens on me, bombers for my whole army 
 Andele, andele, baby move fast 
 She drop it down and bring it back, I like that 
 I wanna buy my bitch every bag 
 So she ain't ever, ever, ever gotta take 'em back 
 [Bridge: Rick Ross] 
 If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book 
 Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look 
 I'm super fly, I'm super high 
 You gettin' yours? I'm gettin' mine 
 [Verse 3: Ne-Yo] 
 Women of a caliber 
 Only seen in magazines and calendars 
 And I'm sitting with Miss October 
 'Cause my birthday's in October 
 Strawberry and her Ros√© on 
 I can see it in her eye, 'cause she wink and she toast me 
 And later on we gonna mosy... 
 To a place where it's populated and get 
 Durty 
 [Rick Ross] 
 If you lookin' for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book 
 Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look 
 [Ne-Yo] 
 Put your eyes to the sky, that's where you'll find meee (ooh ooh ooh) 
 'Cause we are, we are super high 
 Ooh yeah, ooh yeah 
 [Bridge: Rick Ross] 
 [Scratched several times] 
 What the fuck are they yellin' ? 
 Super hiiighhh
