The pain 
 The stress 
 The trials and tribulations 
 The hustle 
 The grind 
 The hate 
 The money 
 The problems 
 So what a G gotta go through 
 It's what hustlers do 
 We America's most wanted 
 Ross, Jalil, DJ Khaled 
 See me on the corner 
 Americas most wanted 
 No we never running away x4 
 And now that we made it 
 We ain't going nowhere 
 No we never running away x4 
 I'm here to make history 
 Claim another victory 
 Tell them haters that miss me 
 I done rammed up 150 
 Swiftly invade playing haters and weirdos 
 Getting money everyday that my beard grows 
 Shining like a higher power 
 Sayonara 
 Fast money running shit a hundred miles an hour 
 Ross and Jalil flossing Bugattis for real 
 Getting money in your city regardless of how you feel 
 Americas Most 
 Cleveress quotes 
 American money from that Mexican dope boss 
 My watch, Swiss 
 My rocks glisten 
 History in the making (Jalil) 
 Watch this 
 See me on the corner 
 Americas Most wanted 
 No we never running away x4 
 And now that we made it 
 We ain't going nowhere 
 No we never running away x4 
 I done been through the struggles 
 Now I'm fighting a war 
 Just to get to the top 
 And I done witness my mother passing away 
 And my new brother Niko getting shot 
 Sixteen it was me against the world 
 And my pops hospitalized 
 To cut and weave hair 
 To me there was no point on doing good 
 But I started off grinding 
 And now I made it out the hood 
 There's nothing I ain't been through 
 Nothing that I ain't do 
 I done been through hell and back 
 Now I'm looking for my angel 
 Looking for a mentor 
 Running from the police 
 Jersey got my back so no I ain't running lonely 
 See me on the corner 
 Americas most wanted 
 No we never running away x4 
 And now that we made it 
 We ain't going nowhere 
 No we never running away x4 
 We ain't running away 
 No no no 
 Whoa 
 Jalil, Fipstar, Ross 
 Drop dead beats 
 We ain't running away
