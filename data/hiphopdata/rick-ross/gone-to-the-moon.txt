Let me tell you how meny money there can bye 
 First class flight to the moon 
 Jewish mafia nigga 
 Maybach music 
 October 13, meek milly, dreams and nightmares 
 I think you all know exactly what the fuck that is 
 Ha, ha, ha 
 God forgives the I don't on the road of platinum 
 Yeah, warner brothers, dej jam records 
 The power circle, maybach music! 
 Shout out to the entire conglomerate, nigga 
 Black bar mitzvah- all you niggas invited 
 -You were invested like jews, nigga 
 I'll be at these wars, I still be living by rules 
 So when I run in the dudes 
 You know we're stumping in the mood 
 Pop and lock go to popping niggas say when they're flopping 
 Let me get back to my bitches cause you bitch niggas ain't nothing 
 Miami boys and this bitch 
 I brought out all the zoes with me 
 Still buy pussy from strippers and send them kilos to philly 
 Nigga real as it gets, look at the wheels on my whip 
 You want to go to the moon, I'm screaming re-load the clip 
 I bought my bitch from perfections, you know I buy my affection 
 Ain't no love for me, nigga, and I accept my direction 
 On my road to perfection, so many hours invested 
 So many niggas we handle 
 You know the other profession 
 I'll go to the moon 
 I'll go to the moon 
 I'll go to the moon 
 I'll go like baloon
