We took the foes off the Chevy and we sat it those sixes (sixes) 
 Lipstick on them rims got them rims blowing kisses (kisses) 
 They know what it is 
 Y'all know what it is 
 He know what is is 
 She know what it is 
 Twenty rubber bands you could get your self a pigeon (pigeon) 
 Bring another ban get yourself a pound a midget (midget) 
 They know what it is 
 Y'all know what it is 
 He know what is is 
 She know what it is 
 On them 26s shirts on a 71 chevel 
 Like I'm riding carousel shorty I can't parallel, 
 They say shawty give 'em hell 
 Shorty I'ma give 'em hell, 
 Quarter milly worth her jewelry 
 Like that boy can't even care 
 'Bout no money 'bout no hoe 'bout no car 
 'Bout no clothe boy you better hold your nose 
 'Cause I'm shitting on your nose 
 Keeps a Louie bag for what? 
 Bitch I been had swag, I got 50 thou' 
 Cash in a brown Kroger bag. 
 My chain is worth a mansion and my wrist is worth a lambo 
 But I'm living in a mansion and I'm riding in a lambo 
 Bunch a gangstas like sopranos white keys like pianos 
 And I'm looking for a bitch that wants to join me in a porno 
 Hello darling how ya doing that's yo man you need to lose him 
 He ain't doing what I'm doing my doors tall Patrick Ewing 
 Urkel purple pass the cushion straight from Oakland 
 It just flew in if I bust the package open you would think I started brewing 
 And it's a trend you better follow money running like a lotto 
 Every bitch in here a model saying balling is my motto 
 That's the truth and you can swallow 
 What I said or take a hollow me I'm in that monte carlo 
 Zoe up in that murcielago 
 Lamborghini got these breezies tripping fiending 
 That they need me jus to see me or be wit me in 
 They vicky c bikini but I really ain't that needy 
 If you wanna kick it wit me grab that kush 
 And one them breezies pour a glass of that martini
