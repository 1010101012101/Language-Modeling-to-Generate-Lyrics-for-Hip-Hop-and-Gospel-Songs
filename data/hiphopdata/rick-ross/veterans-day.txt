I like my pussy a little wetter, my drinks a little colder 
 My girls a little older with her hair past her shoulders 
 Like my weed a little stronger, my money a lot longer 
 If blooding ain't right than I couldn't be a wronger 
 I'm a bad muthafucker, be very afraid 
 Boy this heat will give your ass a raspberry beret 
 Been in the building muthafucker we ain't never escape 
 Cash Money is the army, Veteran's Day 
 The block got hotter, the World got colder 
 So fuck a diamond chain we wearing guns on our shoulder 
 If you want it you can get it, come and sign up, 
 We got choppers that will put that Tony Romo 9 up 
 Man we so about it, 5 star count it 
 Could have fucked the World but I left it how I found it 
 Took the game to school now I'm 'bout to cap and gown it 
 Got a circle of success you can say I'm way around it 
 Yeah and by the way my name is Touch???? 
 (Verse 2 - Birdman) 
 Uptown roller, take it off your shoulder 
 Tommy's with the flag, spent the hundred high rollin' 
 Flipped it off the condo, made it off the conda 
 Sky scraping condo top floor aroma 
 High to the sky when I step up in this bitch 
 Thousand dollar cologne, no ceiling in this bitch 
 The marble for the Louis the bag full of cash 
 Keep a strap on me, a mill' on the tab 
 Priceless with these numbers, flipping in the seat 
 Junior doing time, kicking up his feet 
 A mill' on the books, I'm stuntin' with a fleet 
 A pretty red bitch we smash every week 
 Blowing on some good Maybach back seat 
 The bitch sleeping good, a mill' on the sheets 
 Born rich from the hood YMCMB 
 Yeah Maybach, brrrap 
 (Verse 3 - Rick Ross) 
 I'm that fat muthfucker, young entrepreneurs 
 Zombies in the street we got them pouring out the sewers 
 Most controversial in the muthafucking truest 
 And by looking at my jewels I'm still the muthafucking coolest 
 Waving your flag you just a fucking blood donor 
 And this bitch far from bad who put these fucking Uggs on her 
 Took her to California spent a fucking dub on her 
 When she walk up in the club now every fucking thug want her 
 I'm just so fucking special, let's see what's on the menu 
 Fuck the promoter my grand bigger than the venue 
 This the shit I'm into all black in the rental 
 My chopper be making hits it's such a sad instrumental 
 These niggas love boys enjoying their little toys 
 I'm building hotels off the coast of St. Croix 
 100 mill' I accept nothing less 
 Black Raybans and Obama's next address
