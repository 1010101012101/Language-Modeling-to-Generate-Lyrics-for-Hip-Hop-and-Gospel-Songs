(Feat. Lil' Wayne & T-Pain) 
 (Chorus: T-Pain) 
 Gotta fresh line up fresh outfit bouta have the parking lot on smash 
 Plus I got a chevy with a 4-54 in da hood dat bitch got 1-25 in da dash 
 She like a gangsta cause 
 I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far [x3] 
 Cause it just another day in the life of a goddamn boss 
 (Verse 1: Ross) 
 I don't make love baby we make magic 
 Come home with a thug, let's get shit crackin' 
 Always wear plastic cause baby shit happens 
 She leave the backseat just to freak in da magnum 
 Hopped out the magnum hopped in the tray 
 Just to let the top back and thank God for the day 
 Who gives a fuck what a hater gotta say? 
 I made a couple million dollars last year dealin' weight 
 Still in da streets strapped with them thangs 
 She in love with a G so she tatted my name {ROSS} 
 I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far 
 Ten black maybacks back to back in a lane 
 I'm a make it rain then I'm a make it back 
 You are just a lame lil homie that's a fact 
 Workin with the police actin' like ya know me 
 Fresh outta jail already in ya old? 
 (Verse 2: Lil Wayne) 
 Go by the name of weezy f and 
 I'm walkin' out the bally store with 10 grand 
 Fly as mutha fucka girly on my stable 
 Cause her friend say I'm a tommy sucka 
 Don't go below the naval

 Bottle after bottle and I'm sure you count 'em all
