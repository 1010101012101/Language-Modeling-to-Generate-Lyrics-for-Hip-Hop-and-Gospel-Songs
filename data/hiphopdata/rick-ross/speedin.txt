Rick Ro$$: 
 Legendary. Runners, you know me. 
 R. Kelly:

 Rick Ro$$: 
 Trilla. 
 R. Kelly: 
 Oh whoa. Oh whoa. 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ro$$) 
 Every dollar that I count can't grow in my account 
 My account can't count up all my money in an hour 
 'Cause it's comin' too fast & I'm scared it won't last 
 Look that white girl in her face told her this was her last dance 
 God damn speed got my heart racin' 
 See I don't have the nominations you can blame it on my occupation 
 Caesar salad, Caesar's Palace 
 You not a boss little nigga 'cause your cheese is average 
 In the Benz AK ridin' shotgun 
 It's a Benz 'cause your broke till you got one 
 It ain't nothin' do 100 in the maybach 
 Throwin' money out the roof muthafuckin' brake pads. 
 (Chorus: R. Kelly) 
 Fast life, I live, big cars, big cribs, Speedin' 
 I'm Speedin' I can't stop it's all I know 
 From a youngin' I was taught get doe 
 I'm Speedin' I'm Speedin' I'm Speedin'. 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ro$$) 
 See people came lookin' for me shit I got ghosts 
 See the west coast close and up in the lamontrose 
 Big money boss major 
 American Idol, I got fans like fantasia 
 Read between the lines or yo' ass like fantasia 
 Get hit between the eyes he died they can't save him 
 I'm a posh I'm weevin' no joke no joke but I'm Speedin' 
 Starin' at the skyline I got a million on my mind I'm the best 
 And these pussy niggas runnin' out of time (Ricky Ro$$) 
 I'm the chill quarter mill for the time piece 
 Yeah I bought a wheels like deals for the dime piece. 
 (Chorus: R. Kelly) 
 Fast life, I live, big cars, big cribs, Speedin' 
 I'm Speedin' I can't stop it's all I know 
 From a youngin' I was taught get doe 
 I'm Speedin' I'm Speedin' I'm Speedin'. 
 (Verse 3: R. Kelly) 
 Sittin' in the livin' room watchin' the Grammy's 
 Wishin' that was me that was on the Grammy's 
 All I needed was someone to get behind me money rain on me 
 I was a D turmin' ill nigga 30 shows a mill figure 
 Homey help me out 'cause this boy was a drug dealer 
 Nap time 'cause my gift grew wings 
 And now I'm flyin' down like the cool crew wings 
 Kells and Ro$$ on the Hollywood scene 
 Red carpet and it's smellin' like green 
 Now floss 'cause I got paid off collabo' 
 Was the hit Hip-Hop & R&B boss. 
 (Chorus: R. Kelly) 
 Fast life, I live, big cars, big cribs, Speedin' 
 I'm Speedin' I can't stop it's all I know 
 From a youngin' I was taught get doe 
 I'm Speedin' I'm Speedin' I'm Speedin'. 
 Rick Ro$$: 
 E-Class, I think somebody followin' me 
 Meet me at the helipad wit ya bitch 
 I'm worth 15 million baby 
 I'm tryin' to blow it all in 1 week! 
 Fuckin' wit ya, Triple C's, boss. 
 R. Kelly: 
 I'm Speedin' I'm Speedin'. 
 Rick Ro$$: 
 I'm a fly away on you haters 
 I done came up so fast 
 Movies, endorsements, films... 
 R. Kelly: 
 I'm Speedin' I'm Speedin'. 
 Rick Ro$$: 
 We own things... boss boss boss.
