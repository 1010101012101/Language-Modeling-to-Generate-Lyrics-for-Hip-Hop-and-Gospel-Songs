 Rick Rizzle 
 M-i-yayo 
 Candy all in the paint, rims deep in the dirt 
 Gotta car full of work, nigga pocket full of (?) 
 Choppa on the front seat, sucka if you want beef 
 I'm in dade county, I'm the mayor you can come see 
 Look here I'm well known, what you say? (I'm well known) 
 Kush by the el-bow, I love when it smell strong 
 Otherside of the bridge, niggas die just to live 
 You want a beach, don't sleep 45 to ya wig 
 Represent Carol City, Dirty South ride wit me 
 M-I-Yayo on the map now it's my city 
 Pullin out the Seven trey, ever-other day 
 Got bout 40 in it, hit ya hoe for 40 minutes 
 Pull up on them 24's, while I leanin on the doors 
 And I'm letting sucka's know, that I get it for da low 
 I get it for da low (ROSS), I get it for da low 
 I get it for da low (ROSS), I get it for da low 
 Pull up in that white on white, know you wonder what it's like 
 Know you wonder what's the price, ain't nothing to a boss 
 I get it for da low (ROSS), I get it for da low 
 I get it for da low (ROSS), I get it for da low 
 Niggas know how I does, neighborhood full of thugs 
 Everybody sellin drugs, task force duckin us 
 Load up the big guns, got so many which one? 
 Everybody get to buy a house when the bricks come 
 Hoes know my whole name, famous for co-caine 
 Yeah I'm bout to blow game, but I'm bout to blow mane 
 Rick Rizzle clockin' dough, inventory gotta go 
 If a nigga want it hard cook it like papa (doughs?) 
 Fat boy super cool, got something you can move 
 When I did what I do she got like a swimmin pool 
 Oh boy real wet, so boy hell yeah 
 I'm a millionaire but where I'm going I ain't there yet 
 Pull up on them 24's, while I leanin on the doors 
 And I'm letting sucka's know, that I get it for da low 
 I get it for da low (ROSS), I get it for da low 
 I get it for da low (ROSS), I get it for da low 
 Pull up in that white on white, know you wonder what it's like 
 Know you wonder what's the price, ain't nothing to a boss 
 I get it for da low (ROSS), I get it for da low 
 I get it for da low (ROSS), I get it for da low 
 Go on let ya top down, fuck it blow a couple grand 
 Treat her like an animal, make her do a hand stand 
 Club Rolexx (lex), you can stunt yo 
 I stood on a rolex smokin' on a blunt hoe (ross) 
 I'm heavy mane, off in this chevy game 
 Dip it in the pretty paint, chromed out everything 
 Take it back to the block, triple C across the top 
 In an oldschool motor brand new out the box 
 Got 'bout a hundred killas runnin' wit a hundred niggas 
 Tell it there to ya face, don't nobody want it wit us 
 Niggas dead broke, they better shake it off 
 Skycap ass niggas mad that we takin' off 
 Pull up on them 24's, while I leanin on the doors 
 And I'm letting sucka's know, that I get it for da low 
 I get it for da low (ROSS), I get it for da low 
 I get it for da low (ROSS), I get it for da low 
 Pull up in that white on white, know you wonder what it's like 
 Know you wonder what's the price, ain't nothing to a boss 
 I get it for da low (ROSS), I get it for da low 
 I get it for da low (ROSS), I get it for da low
