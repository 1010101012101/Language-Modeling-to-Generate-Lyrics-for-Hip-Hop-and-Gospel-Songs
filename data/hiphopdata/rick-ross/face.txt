I fuck 'em once, I fuck 'em twice 
 I fuck 'em three times, change your life 
 Nine times outta ten, it's a big body Benz 
 With a real nigga in it, ride if you wanna win 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face 
 Nine times outta ten you wanna fly yellow thang 
 That can entertain, make it in my yellow chain 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face 
 Sellin' dope, countin' money keeps my dick hard 
 Time to bust it wide open for a big boy 
 Big yellow thang, all black boots 
 Money like Mariah, Rihanna hair due 
 Mind on the money but this bitch so fine 
 Took my eyes off the money, watch this bitch the whole time 
 Mind on the money but this nigga so fly 
 Time to jump up in that Benz and ride that thang the whole time 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 Doing twenty miles per hour 'cause I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 Sittin' at the green light 'cause I'm gettin' face 
 Nine times outta ten, it's a big body Benz 
 With a real nigga in it, ride if you wanna win 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face 
 Nine times outta ten you wanna fly yellow thang 
 That can entertain, make it in my yellow chain 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face 
 I does it like a boss every time I pull it out 
 'Cause she catch it like a glove but it's all over her mouth 
 Excellent face, excellent pase 
 Number one nigga, baby, you got excellent taste 
 Nice condo, I'm talking forty flows 
 It's only me and Gucci maybe forty hoes 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 If I fuck 'em more than once, baby gettin' lace 
 She gotta car, she gotta job 
 She's a lucky girl, my shinning star 
 Nine times outta ten, it's a big body Benz 
 With a real nigga in it ride if you wanna win 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face 
 Nine times outta ten you wanna fly yellow thangs 
 That can entertain, make it in my yellow chain 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face 
 I'm gettin' face, I'm gettin' face

 Nine times outta ten you wanna fly yellow thang 
 That can entertain, make it in my yellow chain
