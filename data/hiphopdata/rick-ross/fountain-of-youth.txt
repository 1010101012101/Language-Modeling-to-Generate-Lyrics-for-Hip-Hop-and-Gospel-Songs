Fountain of youth 
 May our legacies live forever, huh 
 All my niggas quiet but we burning loud 
 Makaveli to the max: never turn it down 
 Mac 11 in a Benz: how you like me now? 
 I run the city so my closet look like Nike Town 
 Niggas talking like bitches, is it my income? 
 Am I fucking your bitches? Is it official? 
 My nigga did a dime, didn't learn a thing from it 
 Came home, in two weeks got him a 600 
 Get a text from the boss: you know them bricks coming 
 Chicks at the beach house like they gonna miss something 
 From the churches I rose, only loving the dough 
 From the Chevy to Rolls, now it's fur on the floor 
 Smoke an ounce of the truth: that's my fountain of youth 
 R.I.P. to Mr. Shakur, this one is for you 
 Nippsey Hussle and I got my nigga Stalley on it 
 Double MG burning out in Cali on it 
 Stained glass window in the Benzo 
 Lost in the instrumental 
 Keys got me sentimental 
 These rap books buried in gold 
 The treasure of a million men, Versace shades trimmed in gold 
 My life's big like them cameras explode 
 Capture this rags to riches story that I unfold 
 The youth fountain for the few counting 
 Made money, but who's counting? 
 It's hard stunting living in subsidized housing 
 Every bag you bring though the door, dude's counting 
 And every new girl you bring through, dude's hounding 
 They want your youth, so they watch your moves 
 From your pinky ring, down to how you lace your shoes 
 Rope chains with the precious jewels 
 The dope game had impression rules 
 What they did with cocaine and a couple spoons 
 Had the whole hood acting like goons 
 Trying to be the richest, trying to the be fliest 
 Claim to be balling, end up like Len Bias 
 Screaming from the bottom of this fountain here, nothing but silence 
 Stained glass window in the Benzo 
 Lost in the instrumental 
 Keys got me sentimental 
 Laces in my blue Chucks, represent my bros first 
 Staring at my Rollie bezel as I soul-search 
 Run this money marathon till my soles hurt 
 But no materials could measure what my soul's worth 
 I wanted everything, feel like I had no choice 
 Young niggas wishing on a star like Rose Royce 
 Being honest, killing mamas when we sold work 
 I made a promise, give me options and I cold-turkey 
 Sick of sitting on the side while it's game point 
 Recurring dream, tryna scream but ain't had no voice 
 Crazy lady speaking tongues said it's gon' work 
 Never vocalize my visions, actions was my spokesperson 
 Study rich niggas' moves like my homework 
 Sacrilegious; however, streets was my own church 
 Stained glass window in the Benzo 
 Lost in the instrumental 
 Keys got me sentimental
