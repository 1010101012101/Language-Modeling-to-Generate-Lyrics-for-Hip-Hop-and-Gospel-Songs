(Diddy) 
 You n-ggas paranoid, 
 I party gettin' money 
 I know I'm the sh-t my janitor be getting money 
 I got a skyscraper, it's a hell of a view 
 Got me closer to God, angel wings on my coupe 
 Pray for me, I grind everyday for it 
 If you see me riding in it, means I paid for it 
 Bugatti Boyz 1.8 fours 
 I got money baby I could order 8 more 
 F-ck the Forbes list lets tell the truth I ate more 
 I got a billion baby time to get 8 more 
 12 bedrooms, time to get 8 more 
 Stack up all the cases of Ciroc on the 8th floor 
 (Chorus - Rick Ross) (Diddy in brackets) 
 Got a hundred million 
 (Its time to get another one) 
 How this Bugatti feel 
 (I may need me another one) 
 5 bad b-tches 
 (Just got me another one) 
 P Diddy run the city 
 (Never be another one) 
 5 mill cash 
 (And I need another one) 
 Rocking a different Rollie 
 (No this not the other one) 
 Stacking a number gettin' money 
 (N-gga number one) 
 Real n-ggas run the city 
 (Never be another one) 
 (Diddy) 
 These haters speculate 
 They always watching mine 
 She know what time it is 
 Just like my watch line 
 My clothes line 
 The cologne b-tch 
 I know you smell this money sitting on this throne b-tch 
 I'm strong b-tch 
 I own sh-t 
 Gave myself a ten digit bonus 
 I'm the money man, never financed 
 Go get this money baby, with yo fine ass 
 If ya n-gga broke it's time to get another one 
 If you b-tch is trippin' time to get another one 
 I'm Puff Daddy b-tch there'll never be another one 
 Bugatti Boyz forever one 
 Got a hundred million 
 (Its time to get another one) 
 How this Bugatti feel 
 (I may need me another one) 
 5 bad b-tches 
 (Just got me another one) 
 P Diddy run the city 
 (Never be another one) 
 5 mill cash 
 (And I need another one) 
 Rocking a different Rollie 
 (No this not the other one) 
 Stacking a number gettin' money 
 (N-gga number one) 
 Real n-ggas run the city 
 (Never be another one) 
 (Rick Ross) 
 I feelin' the money 
 I'm lovin' the paper 
 N-gga hate in the hood 
 Took his hoe to Jamaica 
 If I let down the top 
 Let the breeze in my beard 
 VIP is the spot, they playing musical chairs 
 My Columbian the man, holla beam me up Shawty 
 Got that money in the bag that can hold a f-cking body 
 1.5 for this brand new black Bugatti 
 Jewels like I'm Slick Rick 
 Ballet shoes lade dade 
 I'm billin' myself, b-tch you do the same 
 F-ck what I spend at the bar 
 You should see how I came 
 Keep my b-tch at her best 
 With one foot in the trap 
 If I bust at your chest I bet that's a wrap 
 Take that 
 Got a hundred million 
 (Its time to get another one) 
 How this Bugatti feel 
 (I may need me another one) 
 5 bad b-tches 
 (Just got me another one) 
 P Diddy run the city 
 (Never be another one) 
 5 mill cash 
 (And I need another one) 
 Rocking a different Rollie 
 (No this not the other one) 
 Stacking a number gettin' money 
 (N-gga number one) 
 Real n-ggas run the city 
 (Never be another one)
