Sample: 
 Come and take a ride. 
 Come and take a ride. 
 Rick Ro$$: 
 Billionaire 
 Yayo. 
 (Justice League) 
 Rick Ro$$: 
 57 years, yes! 
 Blood for a D-Boy 
 Hand my mack 11 to the engineer to record 
 Got the baddest women in the world for me to feed on 
 Double deck yacht, docked Boss, blowin' seed up 
 Revenue incredible, it put me on a pedestal 
 Columbia to Mexico, I figure there was a better rule 
 Look at me, a model now 
 Models and bottles 'round 
 A Blood holla' ballin' 
 But the boys in blue, they shot 'em down 
 Gang-affiliated, colors prosecutors painted 
 'Cause the niggas I employed, name synonymous with Mi-Yayo 
 Instrumentals that are mental, Maybach kind of mental 
 400 off the lot, the block is monumental (Boss) 
 Some things money can't buy 
 Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride 
 In the rear, so many instruments I hear 
 Tucked behind curtain, no signs to fear (Ro$$!) 
 I'm higher than a leer / Aaliyah 
 This Maybach Music, designer shit I wear 
 May 'cause you to lose it 
 Close your eyes and inhale the smoke 
 It's Maybach Music, the realest shit I wrote, nigga! 
 5 ounces, take a toke 
 Of this Maybach Music, the realest shit I wrote 
 Boss! 
 Jay-Z: 
 Young! 
 Fuck it then. 
 Jay-Z: 
 Black Maybach, white seats, black pipin' 
 Remind me of Paul McCartney and Mike fightin' 
 You know, +The Girl Is Mine+ 
 +Life's A Bitch+, so +The Whole World Is Mine+ 
 The 6 deuce long, the curtains are drawn 
 Perfectly like a Picasso, Rembrandts and Rocco's 
 I'm a major player, 40 40's in Vegas at the Palazzo 
 They said it was not so 
 Certain things that money can't buy 
 Like bein' this fly 
 Till then I'm just gonna' ride! 
 I'm like G-Rap with better transportation 
 On the road to the riches, reach my +Final Destination+ 
 And the lair, closer to a leer / Aaliyah 
 Say a +Prayer+, hope I get ta' see her 
 When I disappear from here, baby, yeah! 
 But I don't see the endin' through these millionaire lenses 
 Just the 2 M's on the emblem 
 The partition roof, translucent and Humador 
 Where refrigerators, where Ace of Spades, 2 I store! 
 True story, my closet is like 2 stories 
 Cut to the happy ending 'cause I don't do stories 
 Shawn Corey, real rap 
 The Maybach is bananas, peel back. 
 You feel that? 
 Young! Come on! 
 Jay-Z: 
 Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach 
 8 track episodes, been doin' this since way back 
 Since way back, since way back 
 8 track episodes, been doin' this since way back! 
 Realest shit I ever wrote, chillin' in my Maybach 
 8 track episodes, been doin' this since way back 
 Since way back, since way back 
 8 track episodes, been doin' this since way back! 
 Rick Ro$$: 
 Boss! 
 Can't be stopped now 
 We got too much cake. 
 Rick Ro$$: 
 They pinchin' pennies, while I'm musclin' for meals 
 And the muscle be that muzzle, when I stuff it in your grill 
 Stuffed shells, thanks to crack, I crack 
 Crab and lobsters, not all mobsters 
 Imposters, got'cha! 
 Boy, I got an eagle view, slanted on my balcony 
 Can only stay a week or 2, so many people out for me 
 I bulletproofed the Maybach 
 Got a killer's Intuition 
 Holdin' on that mack 11, Makaveli premonition 
 Waitin' on my Suge Knight 
 One nation under God, since I chose a thug's life 
 Guess I gotta' play my part 
 Never will I die, my name symbolize 
 The hustle for young killers comin' from the other side 
 Some things your money can't buy 
 Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride 
 I'm large, my black car 
 Menagin' black broads, massage for frauds 
 I'm livin' large, sellin' fat rocks 
 In the +Killin' Field+ of hip-hop 
 Runnin' up on the car, you get popped, mopped and dropped! 
 I'm The Boss!
