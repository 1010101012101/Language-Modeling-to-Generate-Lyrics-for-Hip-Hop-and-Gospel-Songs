(Chorus: Rick Ross (Dr. Dre)) 
 Designer jeans, and a hand full of dough (Yeah) 
 Bottle of that Jose, pass me some mo' 
 I got, mo' cars, (mo' cars,) mo' clothes, (mo' clothes) 
 Mo' money means mo' dough to blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' bottles is mo' dough to blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Rick Ross got a lotta dough to blow 
 (Verse 1: Rick Ross) 
 Way up in them Cali Hills, burnin' like the sun set 
 A nigga wit' a attitude, take it outta context 
 Riding wit' them big things, lookin' like a bomb threat 
 Bin Laden beard, afghan in a bomb vest 
 Ross, stranded on the death row 
 Makavali's on the Maybach, kicks retro 
 She wanna gaze at the stars 
 Through a panoramic view, pullin' haze out the jars 
 Rick Ross, I'm the best in the flesh 
 Getting blessed on the chess, it's a way to reflect 
 Hard work pays off, I'm a boss, you can tell 
 By the bottles in the pail, and the models that we share 
 I'm in a realist state, and a realist state of mind 
 We came from trigga' play, kill a nigga for a dime 
 I'm tryna' chill today, I got a million on my mind 
 Dice in my hand, one roll, I blow ya' mind 
 (Chorus: Rick Ross (Dr. Dre)) 
 Designer jeans, and a hand full of dough (Yeah) 
 Bottle of that Jose, pass me some mo' 
 I got, mo' cars, (mo' cars,) mo' clothes, (mo' clothes) 
 Mo' money means mo' dough to blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' bottles is mo' dough to blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Rick Ross got a lotta dough to blow 
 (Verse 2: Rick Ross) 
 Mo' trips, mo' whips, mo' money, I'm mo' rich 
 Mo' hatas', mo' clips, mo' jewels, mo' fish 
 Half a hundred grand and some rubber bands 
 Gats off fast in my other hand 
 On the other hand, I'm still pitchin' underhand 
 All soft balls, all bases covered man 
 Mo' trucks, mo' bucks, mo' freaks, mo' butts 
 I see the vision, from club vision to Prive 
 I get brain, I bust nuts in each states 
 Soon as I see what I'm lookin' for 
 I sit up in that seat and cut em' off on them 24's, there it goes 
 Baby girl, come talk wit' the boss 
 I pop a Jos bottle, you can kick ya shoes off 
 (Chorus: Rick Ross (Dr. Dre)) 
 Designer jeans, and a hand full of dough (Yeah) 
 Bottle of that Jose, pass me some mo' 
 I got, mo' cars, (mo' cars,) mo' clothes, (mo' clothes) 
 Mo' money means mo' dough to blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' bottles is mo' dough to blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Rick Ross got a lotta dough to blow 
 (Verse 3: Rick Ross) 
 Ever seen a fat boy in a big body 
 Know you wanna sit by me, all you do is think 'bout it 
 Lease apartments to get kicked out it 
 Next day, buy a condo to get a kick out it 
 We don't take you for the view, this is what I do 
 When I'm on the beach, all my diamonds are water blue (Ross) 
 Let's party like the pack jam, Pac Man 
 Fifty grand, stacked in my lap man 
 Get a lap dance (and if you get my dick hard) 
 This ya' last chance (to hop up in that big car) 
 Wit' tha' Fat Man (certified Hood Star) 
 But he a millionaire (look bitch I'm going far) 
 This the movement, a few niggas you wanna move wit' 
 Gucci on my feet, see I'm only in that new shit 
 Ha, they say life's a bitch 
 But close ya eyes for a minute, and just bite this dick, it's Ross 
 (Chorus: Rick Ross (Dr. Dre)) 
 Designer jeans, and a hand full of dough (Yeah) 
 Bottle of that Jose, pass me some mo' 
 I got, mo' cars, (mo' cars,) mo' clothes, (mo' clothes) 
 Mo' money means mo' dough to blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Mo' bottles is mo' dough to blow (Bloooowwww) 
 Rick Ross got a lotta dough to blow 
 (Chorus: Rick Ross (Dr. Dre)) 
 Designer jeans, and a hand full of dough (Yeah) 
 Bottle of that Jose, pass me some mo' 
 I got, mo' cars, (mo' cars,) mo' clothes, (mo' clothes)
