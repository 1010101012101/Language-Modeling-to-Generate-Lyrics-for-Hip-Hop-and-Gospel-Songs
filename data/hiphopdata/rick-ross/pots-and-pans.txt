All I need is bakin soda some pots and pans 
 Little ice up what I can 
 Chick at home sayin' I'm no good 
 Fuck that I'm gettin' out the hood 
 What started as a nickel rock 
 Took 22 months now I'm tryna get a block 
 Fuck football I'm goin' down another path 
 Couldn't past the test 
 To tell the truht I couldn't fuck with math 
 I did get a shcolarship but I blew that 
 Got high, got a ticket and I flew back 
 To the hell zone most straps stand 20 shell toes 
 Get life on yo cell phone 
 Quarter key box of soda Ross whip that 
 Career criminal fa' sho' Ross with that 
 Had to pull my pants up 
 Boy get them brands up 
 Daddy got some cancer I never had the chance to 
 Tell him all my plans to let em' fuck a danca 
 Smokin' weed and AmsterDam with his grandson 
 (Damn) Why he passed on me (on me) 
 My last homie (homie) 
 I went and bought a bird 
 Fuck I want some cash homie 
 I never wrote a nigga coat tail 
 Made her took a dope sell 
 Fuck it nigga oh wells 
 Smokin' on that classified 
 Rollin' in that lac' of mine 
 Know my mind stay numb to the world half the time 
 Thinkin' bout land rover damn near was fucked up 
 Found him in the trunk with another dude fucked up 
 The world fucked up that's why I'm fucked up 
 Don't get fucked up fuck with me ya fucked up 
 Bitch I'ma ride, bitch I'ma die 
 When I holla 305 bitch that's on my life 
 Got a 40 in the car a choppa in the crib 
 The grenades down the street you gotta get it how you live 
 I know niggas turn 1 into 2 and they do what they do 
 And boy them thangs move 
 Fishscale get the big mail 
 In the room full of work 
 In case they came when they inhale 
 It's time for me to cash in laughin' 
 Like Martin in an Aston Martin 
 When I park it I can see ya bitch heartbeat 
 So roll out the red carpet roll up the purple shit 
 Black navigator flew 
 Gotta shut ya fuckin' mouth don't ever take the smooth 
 Thinkin' of a greater way to build a greater flow 
 I hope she got some great head that's how I grade a hoe 
 White beamer in the hood shining like a star 
 Look this half a key go to the club and I'ma buy the bar 
 Do it twice a week fuckin' bitches on the other nights 
 Promise E class we'll never miss another fight 
 Hundred in the bag 5 birds I'ma grab 
 Turn em' into 8 keep me a clean half 
 Bakin soda in the work, works wonderful 
 Ya see ya dream come true 'cause I'm the truth
