[Verse 1 : Rick Ross] : 
 He not bigga den biggy ***** 
 I'm bigger than you 
 Just a boat a mi casa like you a milli or 2 
 Gotta kick off your shoes 
 Okay lets take a cruise 
 Heres my captain now relax, 
 Let him do what he do 
 Okay, Who rollin' spinach 
 'Cause I'm reallin the anchor smoke up up an acre 
 A grass wake up in jamaica, couple nautical nas 
 I call my cubanos ta cop, puerto rico for women 
 Hit barbedos ta shop, livin' larger than life 
 Call this the yacht club, before ya join us ***** ya gotta get your stocks up. 
 She's walkin' back and forth 
 She's just itchen ta **** 
 Then I heard her wisper 
 Travel the seven seas 
 There is no better breaze 
 If he indulgen jelousy his *** better breathe 
 Man overboard 'cause hes goin' overboard, 
 Damn it's over for him put that on my vocal cord.
