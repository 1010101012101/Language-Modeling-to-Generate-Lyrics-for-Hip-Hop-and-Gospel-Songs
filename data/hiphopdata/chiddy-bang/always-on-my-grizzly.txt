I got your back and I'm always gonna hold you down, down 
 Even though sometimes it seems I'm never around yeah yeah 
 I'm gonna roll on tour but I promise I'll be back to you 
 It's you that I want to see, with you is where I wanna be 
 Always, Always, Always 
 They gotta love it here 
 This is something they could rap to 
 Noah asked me to do it, I said I got to 
 And, I used to dream about them mean girls 
 But I had to learn to pay attention in the free world 
 This life we live is fast so many days have passed 
 I need my boarding pass 
 Somebody pour a glass 
 Shot to the roots, this is how I got over 
 I once was a kid somehow I got older 
 Now I'm deep man somehow I'm heep man 
 Infactuated with griddy Puerto Ricans 
 They call me Cubby when I wubby bring the seats in 
 I'm gonna make this shit fresh for you to eat in 
 And I'm just a chef in a kitchen, A jet's what we dip in 
 When we on the side of town 
 No matter what's next, intermission 
 It's you that we missin' 
 We know we gon hold you down 
 Always, Yeah 
 I got your back and I'm always gonna hold you down, down 
 Even though sometimes it seems I'm never around yeah yeah 
 I'm gonna roll on tour but I promise I'll be back to you 
 It's you that I want to see, with you is where I wanna be 
 Always, Always, Always 
 They say we back now 
 I never back down 
 First draft and they just made it in the last round 
 I treat the game like my chick, I'm gon smash now 
 I'm out here early, no breakfast this shit is hash-browns 
 They say we go ham, back to the program 
 Attenedly to my parties with Linsey Lohan 
 They with the success comes envy, I envy no man 
 On tracks, I'm Bulgarian, coat man 
 And still I'm so seasoned, I feel deep here 
 I took the logic so she doesn't need a reason
