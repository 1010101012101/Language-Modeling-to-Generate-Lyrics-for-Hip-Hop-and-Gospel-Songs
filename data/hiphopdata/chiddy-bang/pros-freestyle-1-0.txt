Xaphoon, you crazy... 
 Crazy, crazy, crazy, cra, cra, cra, crazy... 
 Can I rock to this rhyme? You're not on my mind, 
 They said we blowin' up, don't jump on our mine, 
 I once had a tie to the world, I was blind, 
 Now I see everything through these contacts of mine, 
 I'm at the office, yeah I does it again, I touch it, it wins, that's why the label buzzin me in, 
 Uh, told my momma I won't stop till I'm signed, I'm hot with the rhyme, you Megatron, I'm Optimus Prime, 
 I'm locked in a line, I'm just waitin for my turn, still fresh to death, so this paper I gotta earn, 
 I am Stern, David commissioned me for athleticism, the prototype on the mic just check my mechanism, 
 They ask, "How you make the world feel it?" 
 I say it's D-N-A, It's just in my double helix, 
 My controversions sells, if controversy sells, 
 Then I'm a take this 9, shoot the president and bail, 
 Uh, not Barack though I love ya, you in a lower weight class, I'm above ya, 
 Can I get this? Guarantee I spit this, hand on the stand, I guarantee you should witness 
 Yeah, the boy back like retro, I want my car to have NOS like Esco, 
 I'm in that class in the corner I'm special, the flow magic, magic, presto 
 I take off, before it, I break off. Perfect attendance I'm never takin' days off 
 And while I put in work they gettin' a laid off, and this is based off, flow. 
 I'm feeling like I'm near cash, on drive so I steer fast 
 Don't they feel my impact like a deer crash 
 Promised aunty if I win you see its right, make the rain go away like a windshield wipe 
 I'm ripe, I'm raw, I'm everything above 
 A big enough heart to give a hater a hug 
 Shootin off whether its grenades or a slug, still bees honey bees designated by buzz, what?
