Too much soul for the world 
 Too much soul for the world 
 Yeah, how my voice sound 
 We been through everything and more, somehow still we made it merry 
 When everybody that play hot and cold Katy Perry 
 They criticize you because history they can't make 
 And I gotta notice something that's fake about these handshakes 
 I'm to cold, flo to bold we bring you that new soul 
 Music, I got that brand new chicken noodle for your soup bowl 
 Lanky like my new bowl, faded I stole snoop's bowl 
 I'm here I found a loophole, I can track you search for fools gold 
 Look out! 
 'Cause I'm just too fake for the world 
 I know it's just a game to me 
 I'm just too fake you see 
 I wish I didn't have to be but watch out 
 I got too much soul for the world 
 It's breaking my heart in two 
 I got too much soul for you 
 I don't like it but it's true 
 From class clown to class king now we all to laugh 
 They say now you've gone superstar can I have your autograph 
 And then I say yes, they to fake but I can't be stressed 
 Say the way I do it so easy, as can tell them where to go with no GPS 
 And I'm still near it though, the top I cannot fear it though 
 Gotta grapple with the fact that most, cause people didn't give a fuck a year ago 
 My life is pretty as the face of girl, and watch out I've got too much soul for the world 
 Look out! 
 'Cause I'm just too fake for the world 
 I know it's just a game to me 
 I'm just too fake you see 
 I wish I didn't have to be but watch out 
 I got too much soul for the world 
 It's breaking my heart in two 
 I got too much soul for you 
 I don't like it but it's true 
 Look out! 
 'Cause I'm just too fake for the world 
 I know it's just a game to me 
 I'm just too fake you see 
 I wish I didn't have to be but watch out 
 I got too much soul for the world 
 It's breaking my heart in two 
 I got too much soul for you 
 I don't like it but it's true 
 Look out! 
 'Cause I'm just too fake for the world 
 I know it's just a game to me 
 I'm just too fake you see 
 I wish I didn't have to be but watch out 
 I got too much soul for the world 
 It's breaking my heart in two 
 I got too much soul for you 
 I don't like it but it's true
