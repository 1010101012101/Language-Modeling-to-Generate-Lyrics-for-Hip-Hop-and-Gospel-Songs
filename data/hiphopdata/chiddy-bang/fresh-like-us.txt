Fresh Kid Z, fresh Kid C, fresh Kid P, fresh Kid T 
 (Oh yeah, we back) Chiddy Bang 
 And we pretty much amazing 
 Can we hear your new song please? 
 I got you 
 Hey, yo, I once was a kid, all I had was a dream 
 Mo money, mo problems, when I get it I'm going to pile it up 
 Now I'm dope, Wonderbread we can toast 
 So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us 
 Hey, yo, I once was a kid with the other little kids 
 Now I'm ripping up shows and them fans going wild with us 
 Tell mommy I'm sorry, this life is a party 
 I'm never growing up 
 Remember you was a kid, reminisce, days of the innocence 
 Now it's Chiddy Bang, Google me the images 
 Follow me, follow me, I'm the leader 
 And when I park cars I don't pay for the meter 
 I remember I was younger as a kid it was the best 
 I used to touch on all the pretty girls at recess 
 I'm at my peak, yes, I won't leave yet 
 Serial style, cereal all I need's Chex 
 I can make these rappers run like a hard drill 
 Rock band show you how the guitar feel 
 And I could care less how y'all feel 
 I got a flow that make a bitch do a cartwheel 
 This is that good, just puff it and relax bro 
 And you could get it free, don't worry about the tax though 
 And Xaphoon, thank you for the crack 
 But I play a Ron Burgundy, I anchor on the track like what 
 Hey, yo, I once was a kid, all I had was a dream 
 Mo money, mo problems, when I get it I'm going to pile it up 
 Now I'm dope, Wonderbread we can toast 
 So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us 
 Hey, yo, I once was a kid with the other little kids 
 Now I'm ripping up shows and them fans going wild with us 
 Tell mommy I'm sorry, this life is a party 
 I'm never growing up 
 Can I please get a little bit of knowledge? 
 Somebody tell Roth that I don't love college 
 Because the real world's kind of like Real World 
 And it's drama, so you are Svetlana 
 And I'm just a rhymer, swimming in the water 
 Trying to dodge the piranha, and fly to Bahamas 
 Pretty little mama, Chiddy in the spot 
 Where you at, pearl lady? Show me what you got 
 They say, "Why you rapping for the kids for" 
 I say my clothes come fitted, the Lids store 
 This summer you can catch me on a big tour 
 I'm high grade, I think they need to quiz more 
 And let me get with you, don't let the kid hit you 
 I'm the photo album for ??, big picture 
 The rule is, the dude is, so up so chuck, I'm a cool kid 
 Hey, yo, I once was a kid, all I had was a dream 
 Mo money, mo problems, when I get it I'm going to pile it up 
 Now I'm dope, Wonderbread we can toast 
 So fresh how we flow, everybody get their style from us 
 Hey, yo, I once was a kid with the other little kids 
 Now I'm whipping up shows and them fans going wild with us 
 Tell mommy I'm sorry, this life is a party 
 I'm never growing up
