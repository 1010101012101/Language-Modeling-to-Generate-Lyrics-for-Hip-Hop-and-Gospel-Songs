It's one fifty A.M., you know what I'm saying 
 Niggas is gonna get this shit right, no matter what 
 Uh, Yeah, Uh, this year imma make more Gs, make more cheese 
 And I did sauce with Skateboard P 
 Niggas is like" what kinda style is he?" 
 Designered by all the best things in life are free 
 I do this for my little brother, Lyvonte 
 Bitch my flow 'picante' and this is just the entree 
 Imma do what the fuck I want, Waka 
 And if they say they nicer they sometimes they just Chaka? 
 And it's cranberry vodka 
 Hope these niggas don't disturb me 
 And don't you touch my back if your fucking hands are dirty 
 I'm up early 
 And I got racks on racks on racks and got plaques on plaques on plaques 
 Tell them to just calm down and relax 
 They'll slice out like culdesac? 
 Yes, pass me the torch I'm gonna carry it 
 Catch me at the Marriot, an underground Harriet 
 Prolly caught the sackerton?, I'll tell her mom what's happening 
 I'll run all up in them laps we meeting like some track events 
 School more, milk and sweat, broom, chores, itunes, tune chords, fit the kicks on my room floor 
 I was there when Vain came, bro what's up with that name change? 
 This shit is my main thing 
 Aim aim Bang Bang 
 That's wrong son, we the ones on now fuck it we on one 
 She just wanna kick it, no harm done 
 I can never stop it, I'm trending out my topic 
 She make them other bitches hard to see - microscopic 
 Yeah, nigga I got it 
 Xap, just drop it
