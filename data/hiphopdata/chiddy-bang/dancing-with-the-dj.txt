We don't care 
 We don't care 
 We don't care if the sun comes up 
 We don't care if the sun comes up 
 We don't care if the sun comes up 
 'Cause you know we'll be dancing with the DJ 
 We don't care if the sun comes up 
 'Cause you know we'll be dancing with the DJ 
 Come tonight, I'm gonna find your love 
 And we can have a party just the two of us yeah 
 Yeah, praise this beat 
 To the almighty Xaphoon Jones, The Knocks, Chiddy 
 She came to dance insane, too low 
 To a level I never ever seen before 
 Start this, small kiss, that's lean the walk 
 To the fact that I turn it like Tina though 
 And I seen the glow in your eyes 
 Give me them wings, give me them thighs 
 High in the penthouse we can just rise 
 Told her I'm a star and I'm up in these skies 
 Enough of these guys, talking how they really gonna do it 
 Try and get the Benz, try and get the Buick 
 So come in girl, know where you gotta be 
 And I'm one in a million, no lottery 
 I got game, that's EA proof 
 And she told me to come over by the DJ booth 
 I'm in the DJ booth, I rock PJ's loose 
 I want the Absolut power and I don't need Grey Goose 
 I got it 
 We don't care if the sun comes up 
 We don't care if the sun comes up 
 We don't care if the sun comes up 
 'Cause you know we'll be dancing with the DJ 
 We don't care if the sun comes up 
 'Cause you know we'll be dancing with the DJ 
 Come tonight, I'm gonna find your love 
 And we can have a party just the two of us yeah 
 So try to dance to this, and find 'mance to this 
 And later on when you try and find cannabis 
 Like I'm on but I'm pressured no tanning chicks 
 And they always want gifts on some Santa shit 
 Seen one of those that night, she in the back right 
 She had the leggings that killed it up in the black tights 
 And I'm never slipping, even on black ice 
 I'm in the front so they always tryin' to back bite 
 But anyway, back to you 
 And I think you got a good sense of fashion too 
 Your man cool but you need a little passion too 
 Made of Mountain or not, bitch pass the Dew 
 I'm just trying to catch breeze like I'm passing through 
 Sip a couple sangrias if I have to 
 Girl we gotta get going so she say poof 
 Then she started goin' over to the DJ booth so that's why 
 We don't care if the sun comes up 
 We don't care if the sun comes up 
 We don't care if the sun comes up 
 'Cause you know we'll be dancing with the DJ 
 We don't care if the sun comes up 
 'Cause you know we'll be dancing with the DJ 
 Come tonight, I'm gonna find your love 
 And we can have a party just the two of us yeah 
 We can just keep going 
 We can just keep going 
 We gonna be here all night, I swear 
 Still make it in time for breakfast
