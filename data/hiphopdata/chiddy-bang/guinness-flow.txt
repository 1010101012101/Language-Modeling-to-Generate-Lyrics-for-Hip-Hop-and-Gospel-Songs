This is my Guinness flow I'm going for the world record 
 And after that I got the plan to see your girl naked 
 Winners row MTV I could get a show 
 So I could showcase all the talents of my bigger bro 
 And I'm just goin' after everyone who follows me 
 Said I couldn't do it, shit, I accept your apology 
 They love you when you on, that's just human psychology 
 I be number one how's that for numerology? 
 And I don't even know what I be saying, I be playing 
 This graffiti shit I'm spraying is the art I'm displaying 
 And trust me I'll be fine as long as the shorty play it 
 You could pass me the three 
 Never fall I'm athletic ball time 
 Guinness told me I got the longest flow of all time 
 I was rapping in the straight celly, don't call mine 
 You know I got that Guinness flow 
 (Hook - Chiddy Bang) 
 Guinness flow, Guinness flow 
 Like my nigga Chip said, we in this ho 
 (Verse 2 - Chiddy Bang) 
 How could you rap for all nine without failure? 
 And I respond I was smoking in the trailer 
 I'm a G, king of like the Benz wagon G 
 Smoke rabbit meat, I be higher than dragon feet 
 I'm at its peak, doing here, we don't even need sessions 
 Representative telling me I got three seconds 
 Can't stop rapping or I be disqualified 
 Make the mic alive, we personified 
 And I'mma try. Yeah, I admit it, I'm kinda high 
 They try to sell me a product I ain't tryna buy 
 Rapper you should die reading Catcher in the Rye 
 Yeah I think like McDonalds I gotta be superfry 
 Horseback riding: shorty, she could straddle me 
 Yeah, young chidds before I finish though 
 Let me go ahead and hit 'em with the Guinness Flow 
 (Hook - Chiddy Bang) 
 Guinness flow, Guinness flow 
 Like my nigga Chip said, we in this ho
