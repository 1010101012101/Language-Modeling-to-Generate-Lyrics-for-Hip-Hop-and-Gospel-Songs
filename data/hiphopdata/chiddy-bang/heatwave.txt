(Verse 1: Chiddy) 
 It's not the same now 
 We done came 'round 
 And turned this music shit into another playground 
 And they some babies like Huey 
 Bars like a chewy 
 Long as life's a movie I'll be addicted to Louie, yeah 
 To all the haters and traitors I need a podium 
 Benedicts, tell these Arnolds hey, Nickelodeon 
 Special with decimals I'm tryn'a get my point across 
 Say they love me then they flip sides like a coin toss 
 Which one... heads or tails? 
 The way I kill shit, I should be alleged with jail 
 I'm on a ledge and still about math, parabola 
 Legendary shit, wrote raps in my brother's Acura 
 Bro, back when they used to laugh at ya 
 Cause your parents from Africa 
 President, but you cannot assassinate my character 
 Yeah, so check the fahrenheit these days 
 And stay hydrated, welcome to the heat wave 
 (Hook: Chiddy along with hook from "heatwave") 
 Uh, yeah, it's like a heat wave 
 There ain't a place we ain't been to these days 
 Yeah, uh, it's like a heat wave 
 How we do it make it look so easy 
 (Verse 2: Mac Miller) 
 Ayo, this right here a heat wave 
 Keep it on the replay 
 Still we droppin' bombs on these records, call it d-day 
 Yeah I've heard what he say, thinkin' I ain't shit though 
 Got these fools pissed like they just stubbed their big toe 
 All I do is give, though 
 In every single zip code 
 The walls closing in right now, you're just a window 
 Homie, I'm the door from the ceiling to the floor 
 When I spit my verse these rappers ain't rapping anymore 
 And that's for sure, sorry to get cocky 
 Iller than you, and everybody in your posse 
 Homie, I'm probably chilling with some punani 
 Hotter than this wasabi 
 Pittsburgh boy, Sidney Crosby 
 Smoke veggies no casey, no broccoli 
 Tell your girl if she could please stop calling me, she buggin' 
 I need to put her on lock 
 Tired of f-cking that bitch, so I put her on top 
 (Hook: Chiddy along with hook from "heatwave") 
 Uh, yeah, it's like a heat wave 
 There ain't a place we ain't been to these days 
 Yeah, uh, it's like a heat wave 
 How we do it make it look so easy
