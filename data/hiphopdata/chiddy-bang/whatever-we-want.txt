Young kid trying to make that grown man dough 
 No navigation but there's nowhere that I can't go 
 Shit, this beat not like cambo 
 And watch that Xampoo change up the tempo 
 We be in the car rollin', crack a window 
 Shit you always feel good off the endo 
 And I made this for them Hollywood bimbos 
 And do I really need a mothafuckin' intro? 
 Show up to the venue, the food is on the menu 
 And if it ain't the menu then by out what they sent you 
 They hook us up with sour, performing in a hour 
 And gimme 23 more Bobby Jack Bauer 
 Hop in the line and we cut to the front 
 Then I proceed to have a shorty roll me a blunt 
 I say that if you're swelly you can never be stopped 
 I'm in the kinda mood just to get whatever I want 
 It's whatever we want 
 Now, we could do whatever we want 
 We could get whatever we want 
 It's whatever we want 
 Now, we could do whatever we want 
 We could do whatever we want 
 It's whatever we want 
 Whatever we want 
 We could do whatever we want 
 We could get whatever we want 
 It's whatever we want 
 Give it here, give it here 
 Give it here, give it here 
 (Yeah) 
 Give it here 
 (Yeah) 
 I said, "Who down to get drunk?" 
 Smelling through Mr. Le Pew, I gotta pound of that skunk 
 Yeah and I think I could get anything that I want 
 Shorty, she got a fatty, I could see it from the front 
 The bottles is a must, the models should be touched 
 And if I get her tipsy, she'll be swallowing my nuts 
 She wasn't around when I was following the bus 
 I don't care if she down to do what I say without a fuss 
 Yeah, tonight could get a little outrageous 
 Me and my niggas just be picking our favorites 
 Yeah, right off the ground I get her 
 Up for the evening and she down for whatever 
 It's whatever we want 
 Now, we could do whatever we want 
 We could get whatever we want 
 It's whatever we want 
 Now, we could do whatever we want 
 We could do whatever we want 
 It's whatever we want 
 Whatever we want 
 We could do whatever we want 
 We could get whatever we want 
 It's whatever we want 
 Give it here, give it here 
 Give it here, give it here 
 Give it here
