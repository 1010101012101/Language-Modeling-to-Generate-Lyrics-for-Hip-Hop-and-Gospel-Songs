All life I've dreamed a Dream, somehow connected with a Silver Screen 
 All life I've dreamed a Dream, somehow connected with a Silver Screen 
 And yeah I'm back on the scene 
 Making with a dream them haters they gonna scheme like 
 Silver Screen that's all I ever dreamt of 
 And the day I lose, that'll be the end of 
 My journey, tryina focus on ambition cause other successes do not concern me 
 But still I mack like Bernie 
 I'm in in it rappers they say we can win attorney 
 Now I'm drowning in the page 
 They don't understand me, they say I'm hard to gauge 
 Still blowin' up, take the pin off the grenade 
 You're frivolous I'm Nicolas rather me in the Cage 
 NEVER, these rappers gonna stay in trouble 
 Get the US Open like we playin' doubles 
 Hustle for the prettiest green, make sure you're wide a wake in the city of dreams 
 All life I dreamed a Dream, somehow connected with a Silver Screen 
 All life I dreamed a Dream, somehow connected with a Silver Screen 
 And this is my soundtrack 
 Takin' off, no plane, you can't ground that 
 I'm high grade like smokers that don't do regs 
 Life's a movie better hope it ain't a bootleg 
 Stay focused, don't rigamarole, 
 Responsibility you gotta feed the fish in the bowl 
 Uh, play it humble, really though I seen Rash 
 Don't I take the people back like a Dreamcast 
 Play the role, get the scene cast 
 And tomorrow's always brighter with the green hash 
 And I'm 20 below, couldn't make it to the awards swisher comin' from joe 
 They feel it but can't repeat it so they hummin the flow 
 I'm up-tempo, might as well be drummin the show 
 Uh, and I'm blazin' it right 
 Think you swift, well I'm Yeezy and I'm taking the mic 
 Yeah 
 All life I dreamed a Dream, somehow connected with a Silver Screen
