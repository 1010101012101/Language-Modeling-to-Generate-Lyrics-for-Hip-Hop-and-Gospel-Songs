If you hear me ever talking to myself 
 I'm just running through the words I have to say to you 
 Is it over, or is it too soon to tell? 
 I'm just trying not push myself away from you 
 I know we arguing, I know we fight a lot 
 You always think I'm wrong, I think I'm right a lot 
 And when you see me don't I always make your day 
 You from BK, but you can't always have it your way 
 She wanna hit the city, ripping the mall 
 I always seem to be busy, she expecting my call 
 The fast life could make us happiest, upsettin' us all 
 Cause all the anniversaries, forgettin' 'em all 
 But don't be mad, love, I know where it's at love 
 She Jolie but it's pitiful, that's that Brad love 
 What happens when it all goes wrong, we was nice, generosity 
 And impossibly enough, it's animosity 
 I think I gotta just change up my game plan 
 'Cause she and gone fall back in love with the same man 
 But no matter what weather or what the rain bring 
 In the end I'm coming back for the same thing 
 If you hear me ever talking to myself 
 I'm just running through the words I have to say to you 
 Is it over, or is it too soon to tell? 
 I'm just trying not push myself away from you 
 Yeah, shorty just vanished on me 
 She disappeared and yet I do not have no damage on me 
 Some times I feel she's a burden I can't manage on me 
 She say I'm cocky 'cause I got all of the cameras on me 
 But is it my fault, or is it your self-esteem? 
 And got you feelin' like you're a prisoner to my dream 
 Parents just don't understand, and neither do y'all 
 You wanna hype me up and leave me there but I don't blue ball 
 And I say blue ball, cause let me tell you what them guys will teach you any day 
 And then you left but fuck it I don't need you anyways 
 The mentality of love gone wrong, yeah 
 To work it out but we just don't get along, yeah 
 I know it's messed up, we all, affected 
 Tryin' to get through, and the call, rejected 
 And that has changed, if I was ever close to your fragile frame 
 I'd be looking for the words, playing Scrabble games 
 If you hear me ever talking to myself 
 I'm just running through the words I have to say to you 
 Is it over, or is it too soon to tell? 
 I'm just trying not push myself away from you 
 Now everybody say 
 Now everybody say 
 If you see me ever talking to myself 
 I'm just running through the words I have to say to you 
 Is it over, or is it too soon to tell? 
 I'm just trying not push myself away from you 
 If you hear me ever talking to myself 
 I'm just running through the words I have to say to you 
 Is it over, or is it too soon to tell? 
 I'm just trying not push myself away from you
