I hope you know that I'm for real 
 My love is Super Size, ain't no Happy Meal 
 But if I'm gonna stay (got to wear a glove if we're gonna make love) 
 I don't wanna play 
 Baby roulette 
 Baby roulette 
 Yeah uh, we used to get it into college 
 I ain't learn shit, forgot a lot of knowledge 
 The snow bunnies had the odds, boots would love swoops 
 You fall in love with them business majors that love suits 
 But shorties great right? This how we play live 
 Sent her a message like insomnia in on the late night 
 I know there's sharks in the water, but fuck a great white 
 My girl won't know you said you go Penn State right? 
 We playing baby roulette 
 So I delete all the messages I ain't save in the text 
 Next, they can't wait to hear a player confess 
 But shortie, you bullshit and remove that layer of dress 
 Yes, and this is that crazy shit 
 I think that it is that "I'm gonna have a baby" shit 
 But you're someone I cannot have a baby with 
 Just pass the blunt 'cause baby I ain't gonna babysit 
 I hope you know that I'm for real 
 My love is Super Size, ain't no Happy Meal 
 But if I'm gonna stay (got to wear a glove if we're gonna make love) 
 I don't wanna play 
 Baby roulette (yeah it's like) 
 Baby roulette 
 Yeah uh, and maybe it's the way I'm loving her lady lips 
 Part time waitress chick saving tips 
 And I'm still a part of some pretty much amazing shit 
 So roll a window up, baby we finna take this hit 
 We on the top floor, that's what the game bring 
 My love is Super Sized, and imma let Train sing 
 And could we chill what we do is what you assume 
 Late night I just hit, but her roommate was in the room 
 Like damn, could we do this every weekend? 
 The baddest chicks on campus, I need them 
 And I don't hate the women, so I'm prepared for love 
 But if we make it then of course I'm gonna wear a glove 
 I'm your savior, imma text you when I can 
 She falling for me, so I'm gonna catch her when I can 
 And when I call you we back on, loving you with the strap on 
 A bald head in the winter, I keeps my hat on 
 I hope you know that I'm for real 
 My love is Super Size, ain't no Happy Meal 
 But if I'm gonna stay (got to wear a glove if we're gonna make love) 
 I don't wanna play 
 Baby roulette
