Can I rock to this rhyme? 
 You're not on my mind 
 They say we blowin' up 
 Don't jump on a mine 
 I once had a time 
 Tell the world I was blind 
 Now I see everything 
 Through these contacts of mine 
 I'm at the office yeah 
 I does it again 
 I touch it, it wins 
 That why the label buzzin' me in, uh 
 Tell my mama I won't stop till I'm signed 
 I'm hot with the rhyme 
 You Megatron, I'm Optimus Prime 
 I'm locked in a line 
 I'm just waiting for my turn 
 Still fresh as def' 
 So this paper I gotta earn 
 I ain't Stern 
 David commission me for athleticism 
 The prototype on the mic 
 Just check my mechanism 
 And they ask how you make the world feel it? 
 I say it's DNA, It's just in my double helix 
 Controversy sells, 
 Controversy sells 
 And imma take this line 
 To the presidential hill 
 Now Barack, though I love ya 
 You in a lower weight class 
 I'm above ya 
 Can I get this? 
 Guarantee I spit this 
 Hand on the stand 
 I guarantee you should witness, yeah 
 The boy back like retro 
 I want my car to have lights like Esco 
 I'm in a class, in the corner 
 I'm special 
 The flow's magic, magic, presto 
 I take off before, and I break off 
 Perfect attendance 
 I'm never taking days off 
 And while I put in work 
 And they getting a lay off 
 And this is based off 
 Flow 
 I'm feelin' like I'm near cash 
 On drive, so I steer fast 
 Don't they feel my impact like a deer crash? 
 Promise I tear 
 If I wait, you see it's frontin' 
 Make the rain go away 
 Like a windshield wipe 
 I'm right, I'm wrong 
 I'm everything above 
 A big enough heart 
 To give a hater a hug 
 Shootin' off 
 Whether it's grenades or a slug 
 Still bees, honey bees, designated by bugs 
 What?
