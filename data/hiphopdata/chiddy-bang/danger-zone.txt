"Welcome to the New York Port Authority. Exits are in the back, on the left and right." 
 You know me, I'm a upscale character 
 Haters, we ain't mad at ya 
 To the penthouse we go 
 It's time to grind now, so we gotta shine now 
 Never take a time out 
 Leave 'em in the danger zone 
 You know me, I'm a upscale character 
 There is not a challenger 
 To the front page we go 
 It's time to grind now, so we gotta shine now 
 Never take a time out 
 Now you're in the danger zone 
 They in the danger zone 
 I'm in a major zone 
 They stereotype me, they thought my name Jerome 
 Because my skin is dark, I witness art 
 Watch me as I come up from the bottom and ascend the charts, and then I spark 
 I play this right 
 Fork in the road, I made a right 
 Try to take off while them haters just delay the flight 
 I know you watchin' me 
 Them other boys sloppy 
 My flow is dead on, now where's the autopsy? 
 Whores watch me, say hello to my stainless, 
 Got my hand in the cookie jar, visions of being famous, I'm saying 
 You know me, I'm a upscale character 
 Haters, we ain't mad at ya 
 To the penthouse we go 
 It's time to grind now, so we gotta shine now 
 Never take a time out 
 Leave 'em in the danger zone 
 You know me, I'm a upscale character 
 There is not a challenger 
 To the front page we go 
 It's time to grind now, so we gotta shine now 
 Never take a time out 
 Now you're in the danger zone 
 Yeah, my composition is remarkable 
 I am a molecule, they are just a particle 
 And this a article, so you can read all about it 
 And are they messing with us? I doubt it 
 The road less traveled, I'm sorry I'll reroute it 
 And this goes out to everyone that shot me down and doubted 
 Now I'm cumulusly clouded 
 Serious, higher than a Nimbus 
 I swear, I'm on the scene like forensics 
 Just check the stylo 
 We know heat flow 
 Them A&Rs tryin' to find me like Nemo, I mean it 
 You know me, I'm a upscale character 
 Haters, we ain't mad at ya 
 To the penthouse we go 
 It's time to grind now, so we gotta shine now 
 Never take a time out 
 Leave 'em in the danger zone 
 You know me, I'm a upscale character 
 There is not a challenger 
 To the front page we go 
 It's time to grind now, so we gotta shine now 
 Never take a time out 
 Now you're in the danger zone 
 Xaphoon, you crazy!
