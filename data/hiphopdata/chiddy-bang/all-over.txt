Yo zaf what that say 
 I travel all over the place, all over the place, all over the place 
 I travel all over the place, aight yo drop that shit 
 Aloha, bon voyage 
 Man I be out in Europe, and next stop Prague 
 I be everywhere, tell 'em where you going with your swell ass 
 To northern Ireland, chiddy could ring belfast 
 Couldn't picture my life ever being turtle 
 Had a show in Wilmington but we flew out of myrtle 
 Ye and this is my style, numbers that I dial 
 Know that time is limited, I got alot of sky miles 
 Hey for makin' it worst, I was working double shifts like a 
 Agency nurse 
 And maybe at first 
 Eggs, this guys overdone 
 Then hit that slope on 'em now my rise over run 
 If I spit that dope on 'em then my is a done 
 And I'm waiting blow this what you should know 
 If you ain't get the picture understand that there's more to me 
 Got me throwin' my arms around (IDK), morrissey 
 Different cities for these different days 
 It's a daze lately I've been smoking on some different haze 
 Employers hate the day when you find something different pays 
 Remember rapping my parents would tell me it's a phase, yeah 
 Well I'm sorry it's not I'm calling the shots 
 I gotta give it all that I got, yeah 
 Knowledge is power I can't wait to see my mind climb 
 And so does she, she can't wait to give me einstein 
 But she can't call it a quicky 
 Peanut butter love, I be gone in a jiffy yeah 
 See what else do we have but integrity 
 At which point do you become celebrity 
 They want my signature but I don't write allegedly 
 Allegedly a monster can you feel the energy 
 Even though I'm about to change latitude 
 Never stressin I take it easy nigga with attitude
