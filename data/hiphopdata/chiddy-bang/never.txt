Never chase girls 
 Chase dreams first 
 Motion picture drive 
 I concluded that my dream works 
 So I pace right 
 Never see my break lights 
 Never trust a person 
 But damn too many great whites 
 Never work without merit 
 Never live but don't cherish 
 'Cause we only born to perish 
 This is a luxury tariff 
 Here to preach a sermon Eric 
 And it's hysteric 
 They say you too pretentious don't get into that 
 Never the same, out in left like a democrat 
 I would like to present you with this rap award 
 And now I got more gigs than an apple store. 
 And yo you whiling boy 
 You ain't even stylin' boy 
 It's like I'm on a boat 
 Feelin' lonely on this Island Boy 
 My life'll never be the same 
 If never ever was 
 You'd probably feel my pain 
 This is forever 
 This beat is on black pepper 
 You could get shook 
 If you lookin' a little extra 
 Never fall off just make it a little better 
 And when you think it's sunny 
 That's when we change up the weather 
 And when you say you better 
 I bet I say never 
 And If you say you better 
 I bet I say never 
 And when you say you better 
 I bet I say never 
 And If you say you better 
 I bet I say never 
 I never do as I'm suppose to 
 Give me the Light, Sean Paul, 02 
 At homecoming 
 Yeah I went and brought my whole crew 
 I thought I killed it 
 Though they could not hear my vocals (Damn) 
 And they say why you roll that grape stuff? 
 I take a pull and wonder why the Beatles break up 
 Imagination is magic so when I wake up 
 Feel like I'm lookin' up at Hogwarts 
 Would it be wrong to have meetings in my ball shorts 
 The flow excessive 
 Like cops when they usin' whatcha call force 
 Xaph is beast you prolly shoulda brung the west 
 I swear I'm never like a nun when it comes to sex 
 And yeah I po-po-po-po-ker face the best bet 
 Frequent flyer miles 
 I'm tryin' to jet set 
 It's gonna take me higher 
 Might even make me flier 
 Life is a box of chocolates 
 That's why I prefer Godiva 
 This is forever 
 This beat is on black pepper 
 You could get shook 
 If you lookin' a little extra 
 Never fall off just make it a little better 
 And when you think it's sunny 
 That's when we change up the weather 
 And when you say you better 
 I bet I say never 
 And If you say you better 
 I bet I say never 
 And when you say you better 
 I bet I say never 
 And If you say you better 
 I bet I say never
