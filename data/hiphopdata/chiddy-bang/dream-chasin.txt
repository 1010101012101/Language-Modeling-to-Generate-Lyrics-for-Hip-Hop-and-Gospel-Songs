'Ey check the plans out. 
 We work hard, I ain't askin for a hand out. 
 If I hit the booth, I ain't have to pass the grams out. 
 And be the well, when the other thoughts ran out 
 They say they lost words, I got 'em puzzled like a crossword. 
 Harvard, I'm nuts, George Washington carver. 
 But you could never pay your boss peanuts. 
 If it gets messy, be prepared for the clean up. 
 But this thing called success is so strange. 
 'Cause You could get notoriety and still ride the train. 
 Makin' in its entirety, and search for the fame. 
 I'm still Micheal Phelps, swimmin in my lane. 
 Where's Lois? Me? I'm Superman, I'm just here to save the day. 
 Or at least I thought I was. Till I-- 
 Flew in to save her, and I met my opponent. 
 I'm fightin with myself, don't offer the condolence. 
 I'm dreamin'. 
 We chasin' a dream, 
 So what is life? 
 The diamonds and the gleam, 
 Get a job while I'm doin' it, 
 Promise to stay true in it, 
 Doin' it, but never let another soul ruin it, 
 And things ain't what they seem. 
 Make money to spend it, I got my scheme. 
 Work hard while we doin' it. 
 Promise to stay true in it, 
 Doin' it, but never let another soul ruin it. 
 It's too haunting, the task is daunting, 
 Trying to get the labels on board, while flaunting. 
 But, lets make some music. Make some money. 
 Get the rides, European ties, have models for wives. 
 Sometimes I feel faded to pretend, unsafe because 'cause my crib is far from gated in. 
 I'm a relic, but lean slightly to psychedelic. 
 If I could take off, would you consider me angelic? 
 Hysteric. 
 I'm the subject and the predicate. They hatin' on me, tell me where's the etiquette. 
 If you Goliath, I don't need to prove I'm better than. 
 I play David, I'm a fourth year letterman. 
 So Letterman, Can't you hear me knocking on the door? 
 Hard to breathe at this altitude where the oxygen is poor. 
 Think Benz. I don't know what Pontiac means. 
 And this is what happens when an insomniac dreams.
