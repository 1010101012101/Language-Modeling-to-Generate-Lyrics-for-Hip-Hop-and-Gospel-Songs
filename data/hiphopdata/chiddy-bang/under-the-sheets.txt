(Ellie Goulding sample) 
 U left ur blood stain on the floor 
 U set ur sights on him 
 U left a hand print on the door 
 Like all the boys before, like all the boys before 
 This is our luck baby running out 
 Her clothes were never off 
 We still have hours to run about 
 To scale the map, scale the map, to get us back on track 
 I've seen you in a fight you lost, I've seen you in a fi-i-i-i-ght 
 Were under the sheets and ur killing me 
 In our house made of paper, ur words all over me 
 Were under the sheets and ur killin' me 
 (Xaphoon you crazy yo, 
 This that type of shit you can move to, uh) 
 (Chiddy) 
 I ain't worried 'bout the critics 
 But y u tell ur friends that I hit it and quit it 
 I'm just laid back, don't think I'm a party guy 
 And if you look at me, I bet I had you starry eyed 
 What kinda car you drive, don't even know 
 Hard life, UK shit, twenty below 
 And Miss Goulding is exploding 
 I rebound Dennis Rodman with a nose ring 
 I get braino, hi hater no Maino 
 My name Chiddy and she know I'm gon bang tho 
 And that's word to the UK 
 I keep it Kickin and Pushin like I was Lupe 
 My definition is high, I thinks its blue ray 
 And I still could care less what you say 
 My last shorty, she was down to ride 
 And I killed her under the sheets 
 It was homocide 
 (Sample) 
 Were under the sheets and ur killing me 
 In our house made of paper, ur words all over me 
 Were under the sheets and ur killin' me 
 Were in a mess babe, were in a mess babe 
 Ur more is less babe (oh, oh) 
 Were in a mess babe, were in a mess babe 
 Ur more is less babe (oh, oh) 
 (Chiddy) 
 Let me tell you what was crazy tho 
 I fell in love with a shorty up on the radio 
 And what did I call her, a queen 
 Psychadellic shit got all kinds of green 
 Chiddy Bang, spam we all on the scene 
 Used to be academic probation and deans 
 Now we sewing the machine 
 Toast to the queen 
 Let you know how it is 
 No ghost, I intervene 
 I flow and get the cream and I take it apart 
 And every time I fix it, I be breakin her heart 
 Then shit got worse when we made it to the charts 
 Now its different, niece want to tell them faces apart 
 Shorty don't leave me 
 I make it so easy 
 She needs me but I ain't locked down like Weezy 
 I make her give me one on the cheek 
 And she ain't over me yet 
 So I put her under the sheets 
 (Sample) 
 Were under the sheets and ur killing me 
 In our house made of paper, ur words all over me 
 Were under the sheets and ur killin' me 
 Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me 
 Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
