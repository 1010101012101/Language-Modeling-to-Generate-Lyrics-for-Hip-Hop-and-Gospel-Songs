Were only young and naive still 
 We require certain skills 
 The mood it changes like the winds 
 Hard to control when it begins 
 The bittersweet between my teeth 
 Trying to find the in-betweens 
 Fall back in love eventually 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 Can't help myself but count the flaws 
 Claw my way out through these walls 
 One temporary escape 
 Feel it start to permeate 
 (Chiddy) 
 Yeah, I got this right here, I promise 
 Hey, I'm on top now 
 I fly alot now 
 Though my parents used to have me up on lockdown 
 Fist we paddled of the news 
 We need yachts now 
 And we never gon stop now 
 Tell them haters not now 
 This is my moment and ur not gon ruin it 
 If you ever hated ur one of my influences 
 Like tell me how ur runnin' it tho 
 A year ago I was gettin' 500 a show 
 Things change, tell the people never say the flow is equal 
 Try to do good but only get stuck with evil 
 Big dog, they thought I was some kind of poodle 
 That's when I said I heat 'em up like ramen noodles 
 Ya in 3 minutes we winnin' 
 And we never scared of changes 
 So never are we timid 
 Told my mama I'm quitin 
 And she was so livid 
 She said baby you gotta keep killin' 
 And this is how I'm feelin' 
 Make it to the top, u doubt 
 LL 'cause my momma said knock you out 
 I'm the top, u out 
 And the henney is cold 
 Man, shoulda never gave this to a twenty year old 
 It's like the flow is universal like healthcare 
 U at the barbershop, I'm killin' shit elsewhere 
 I ain't had a hand out, no welfare 
 All I had was cable and fresh prince of bel-aire 
 We set up and go and greats way mirror 
 They hatin', ray band, lights wave farewell 
 People know you as chiddy 
 Real name chidera 
 Girls tryna cover shit up, mascara 
 Ya and I've been focused since '08 
 Money make the world go round 
 Let it rotate 
 I'm never focused on what one does 
 And lets toast for the young bloods 
 (Naked and Famous) 
 We lie beneath the stars at night 
 Our hands gripping eachother tight 
 You keep my secrets hope to die 
 Promises, swear them to the sky 
 The bittersweet between my teeth 
 Trying to find the in-betweens 
 Fall back in love eventually 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah 
 (Yeah, I love it) 
 (Can you whisper) 
 The bittersweet between my teeth 
 (Can you whisper) 
 Trying to find the in-betweens 
 (Can you whisper) 
 Fall back in love eventually 
 (Can you whisper) 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah
