Yeah 
 Uh 
 We gettin' busy in the city 
 Lights look bright and the scenery is pretty 
 Tell Memphis I'm on my Grizzly Bear 
 My mixtape droppin' in two weeks 
 We get 'em sent to us, you coppin' them new sneaks 
 So exclusive, I used to think the gang was so elusive 
 Now they feel me like masseuses 
 I author it, Dr. Seuss it 
 You win some, you lose 
 That's the game for you 
 The truth hurts, all I did was ease the pain for you 
 And Chiddy, could you please give 'em illness? 
 I'm on the couch, interviewing Dr. Phil shit 
 It's the danger zone, I gotta hit the killswitch 
 On this pursuit of happiness, I play Will Smith 
 Or Cudi, my MGMT, so good that Gabe Saporta is my buddy 
 And me on the pad is your doom 
 This is a big city, let the madness resume 
 And we go on and on 
 We goin' keep gettin' 'til the gettin' is gone 
 Yeah, yeah, here we go, here we go 
 [The Notorious B.I.G. sample:] And if you don't know, now you know 
 And we go on and on 
 We goin' keep gettin' 'til the gettin' is gone 
 Hey, here we go, here we go 
 [The Notorious B.I.G. sample:] And if you don't know, now you know 
 Here we go, here we go, uh 
 Yeah 
 Uh 
 Adi√≥s to my haters 
 They tell me that you should always keep 'em closer than neighbors, eh 
 50, your gamers, they tell me I got next 
 Paintin' pictures like your sneakers, there's nothing I can't sketch 
 So colossal, and yeah, I'm feeling like Picasso 
 I say we got that good nose candy for your nostrils 
 I'm about my Frito-Lay 
 These rappers want to be Hov, they'll be DOA 
 And we okay 
 Healthy, but they say I have a sick grind 
 Prefer the money like my Mac player QuickTime 
 Makin' moves, can't let the hatin' scare me 
 You, on other hand, Hallmark stationary 
 What you runnin' fam, you could never understand 
 I excel in your career and dance through the running man 
 And to the studio your girl could come 
 I am fresh off the bus, now I got a world to run 
 And we go on and on 
 We goin' keep gettin' 'til the gettin' is gone 
 Yeah, here we go, here we go 
 [The Notorious B.I.G. sample:] And if you don't know, now you know 
 And we go on and on 
 We goin' keep gettin' 'til the gettin' is gone 
 Hey, here we go, here we go 
 [The Notorious B.I.G. sample:] And if you don't know, now you know
