Yeah, Ayo we still gon' hustle hard 
 I ain't sweet nigga, I don't spit them truffle bars 
 Shorty know the deal, so she might as well shuffle cards 
 Used to watch Apollo and know we're higher than shuttles are 
 Real Chiddy. Follow. It. 
 Only like the ladies that, swallow. Spit 
 That when I'm not in the stud' and I'm hoppin' out with crew 
 It's just everyday shit to us, but super high to you 
 Uh, I said obey the code, can't be cereal (serious) 
 Wake up with a blunt and put it right by my cereal 
 Hip-hop that's my shit and Ima take my time to put it out 
 I'm indecisive but I'm packing bowls when in doubt 
 I can rap with y'all twice, this is what you call life 
 Chiddy I'll be hoopin' so I need a basketball, while 
 Niggas just be lookin' at me, that is what they call sight 
 But fuck it we on I guess I'll never have an off night 
 It's serious 
 They don't fuck with Chiddy they delirious 
 Quick to get the kitty, I'll kill it if I'm curious 
 Yeah, that boy fly kinda like a falcon 
 Now why that mixtape shit soundin' like an album 
 I got a wardrobe so I'll be forever stylin' 
 Don't give your number out them ladies probably never dial it 
 You can't fade me, mo'fuck your barber 
 I got a life coach and the skills way harder 
 See how we scape up, windows up and we bake up 
 I be killin' the beats and now they puttin' yellow tape up 
 French girls making me breakfast I gotta crepe up 
 Probly' smearing the make up, after I put my cape up 
 Fast lane, yeah I still can't slow up 
 And when you least expect it that is when I show up 
 And they see me bet a hater gon' throw up 
 And you should try to be like me when you grow up
