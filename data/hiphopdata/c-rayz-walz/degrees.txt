(Verse 1 - C-Rayz Walz) 
 I wrote rhymes on papyrus 
 Clutch the obelisk 
 Manifest the true in livin', reveal the obvious 
 Prominent, dominant 
 Hand secret documents 
 And all the high continents, monuments 
 Only to be awaken by your third consciousness 
 Honor this 
 I hold the secrets to life now in my esophagus 
 Renew my history every time I build with wisdom 
 So when they go I don't have regrets 
 Diss 'em and miss 'em 
 I'm the light and the prism 
 The glitch in the system 
 The assertive victim 
 Who murdered death 
 Managed rhythm 
 Got hyper to the chill with sniper skills 
 Focus my goal 
 Took a stronghold on my soul 
 And puffed an L just to inhale hell 
 Conversatin' with Satan 
 Contemplatin' to add on elimination 
 Baptize my lips and spit the Holy Grail 
 Destined to fail, arrogance cause earthquakes in hell 
 Old people gossip, adults criticize 
 We all judgmental, but can't control our own lives 
 I realized 
 The worlds on my dick so I pissed in public 
 Balance the skills, a real hate and love trip 
 For each slug that hit I got a script with the same 
 Impact of 10 gats, yo in fact I speak flame 
 Focus on the real 'cause I've been that 
 I got a plan for the self hatred end that

 (Verse 2 - C-Rayz Walz) 
 I play 21 with crack heads 
 Slap box rats 
 My blocks a danger chamber 
 Strangers chased by gats 
 I'm the black target 
 Spit first, make the jam last 
 Relentless trenches, beats buried in sand bags 
 Blast back, splash tracks runnin' water 
 My new world order buckshot like terry porter 
 Blaze trails, you way frail like Puffy in jail 
 Y'all drink bubbly in hell 
 I'm prevailing in hell 
 Circle the globe and pose like the son of Jarell 
 Contact the most high before your eyes get the smell 
 Your head swells 
 Thoughts get heavy like barbells 
 C-Rayz born to blaze in my presence you carve Ls 
 Chiseled in the culture 
 Conscious cartel 
 Do the math like vultures 
 While the god dwells 
 On the actual fact my bright light violet-ultra 
 Biting these words will cause ulcers 
 {"Read"} {"Read"} 
 (Verse 3 - C-Rayz Walz) 
 Subterranean brain stacks, dirty train tracks 
 Wrapped up in fame black in the end we the same cats 
 Nourishment for maggots, soil for the earth 
 Life is ritual, death is not a curse 
 If we sin first we are blessed in the last stage 
 I reflect the past age and think straight like Gibraltar 
 Meditate, burn incense at my alter 
 Pour libation for great queens and forefathers 
 I shave brother I come with (?) 
 Understanding my eyes are supreme color copier 
 My afterlife simple as black and white 
 Still movement like water reflecting the moonlight 
 I hear voices in my head and obey what they sent through 
 Ancient vocals upon my thought instrumental 
 Read, study lessons, build your inner power 
 Seek ciphers, the man is being born to this hour
