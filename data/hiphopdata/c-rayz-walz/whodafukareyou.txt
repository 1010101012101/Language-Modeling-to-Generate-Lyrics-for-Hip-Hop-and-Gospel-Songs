Fuck alarm clocks, battle me you'll start wakin' up 
 I slice you with your rhyme book and write verses on your paper cuts 
 With alcohol pads, excuses you'll be makin' up 
 Sound dumb like Outkast breakin up 
 Last time you shot somebody, you had a camera 
 I'm C - Rayz author of stamina 
 Loungin on the walls you'll end up like Humpty Dumpty 
 With your shell cracked, scrambled, in search of something 
 I'm a narcissist, I bomb quick, your full of shit like sausages, pardon this 
 I alone turn crews into the Partridge kids 
 I love games I play you like bragin right cartridges 
 Y'all against me is dragons versus ostriches 
 Totally preposterous, like abortions, I kill stupid kids before they act up 
 Make a new suit flip call it a back tux 
 You cracked up like baseheads in a space ship 
 Playin' skellzies in the matrix, the only thing I lose is my patience 
 I smack the shit out you tissue heads 
 Plus the missile said: you see I'm official dread 
 Hip Hop Don deep into stocks and bonds 
 I'll take a shit in your house, and blame it on your moms 
 Survivin the game when I get money I'm buyin a chain 
 Drivin' a Range and my flame will expire your fame 
 I'm comin' through loaded one, buckin two 
 I'm C-Rayz Walz son who da fuck are you? 
 Ayo yo yo I'm truckin through with my ruckus crew, your luck is through 
 Yo I'm C-Rayz Walz WhoDaFuckAreYou? 
 I'm comin' through fifth knuckle bruise brick fist snuffin you 
 Yo I'm C-Rayz Walz WhoDaFuckAreYou? 
 Who da fuck is you (x5) 
 C-Rayz Walz plain Pat 
 Some people must get jacked 
 My repertoire from back smackin cats wit gats on impact 
 Just like that we festered like bubble in cuts 
 Doublin up now funny cats get fucked up for mumblin stuff 
 The nearest truck rolled up I'm just playin' wit this 
 Every line explosive my pen broken up but 
 Still smokin' strokin thrust, fuck closin shows 
 My frozen flows is hot, let me open up 
 Like Arabian referees who yell sesame plus 
 I'll spread through the industry with leprosy cuts 
 Effectively strut, put a hole in one the second we putt 
 You so pussy you come from a rib you son of a gut 
 Lying ass rappers duck, I'm the lightning struck 
 Blazin' like we lightin a Dutch Masters up 
 At the Mason-Dixon line twistin lime in a cup 
 Get your mind fucked up while your nine in the truck 
 Even my producer know math with his Caucasian ass so 
 Just because you say please doesn't mean I won't blast stupid 
 You gotta show and improvement, brothas live and die for this music 
 Don't do it for amusement 
 Ghetto hi-top blaze you for your hydrox 
 Put glocks on my Irish clock and watch my eyes pop 
 Chicken head, I dead your livestock 
 Do a song with Charles Dutton to see how I rock
