You don't own me 
 Don't try to change me in anyway 
 Don't tie me down, 'cause I'd never stay 
 (RZA) 
 You telling me where to go 
 What to smoke, what a joke 
 How to sleep 
 How to eat 
 How to dress 
 How to vote 
 How to stress 
 How to stroke 
 How to bless 
 How to 
 Mostly you tryna tell me how to think, what a joke 
 You don't own me 
 I'm not just one of your many toys 
 You don't own me 
 You don't own me 
 You don't own me 
 You don't own me 
 (RZA) 
 Keep your nose out of my business and keep your eyes off my wizards 
 Keep the game on those digits and keep that butter on that biscuit 
 You acting like my name in Kunte and your's is Mr Smith 
 You see this four fifth will give your ass a facelift 
 Bumping with the guestlist in that Z-diamond necklace 
 Tryna front like he's a Benz, son was in the Lexus 
 Acting like he New York, he was more like New Texas 
 Oh man, his whole style was recklass 
 More like a mini-van, big with 4 cylinders 
 Got 2 holes up in your chest now 
 And it wasn't from no Dillinger 
 This Shaolin finger jab, the Wu Tang finger style left him needing stitches 
 Snitching like them bitches (bitches) 
 You don't own me 
 You don't own me 
 You don't own me 
 You don't own me 
 I'm not just one of your many toys
