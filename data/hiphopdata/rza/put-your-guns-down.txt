Niggas never grow up, some drink till they throw up 
 Some sniff that cocaine till they fuckin' brains blow up 
 Grass junkies drunk on that Brass Monkey 
 Walk around with the brain of a crash dummy 
 How the fuck you gonna try to gas cash from me? 
 You be in the House of a 1000 Corpse like Rob Zombie 
 Culture this I God, all inside your iPod 
 'Cause my squad, nigga is Die Hard 
 Put your guns down, shoot a few rounds 
 Fifty-two blocks, put that ass on the ground 
 Rocket launcher on my shoulder, world's gettin' colder 
 Hood's like Iraq and I'm just a soldier 
 Put your guns down, shoot a few rounds 
 Fifty-two blocks, put that ass on the ground 
 Rocket launcher on my shoulder, world's gettin' colder 
 Hood's like Iraq and I'm just a soldier 
 Niggas creep, yo check it, yo, yo 
 Welcome to the city of God where it's gritty and hard 
 And these dogs walk around at least fifty a squad 
 Sayin'?, ?Give me a yard?, tryna split me a broad 
 Maybe spit me a dart, so I could get me a car 
 Niggas creep, half can't read or speak 
 Shoot the whole crib, buckwild like Little Zeke 
 From the slums, yeah we be the blind, deaf and dumb 
 We got six year old sons knowin' how to use a gun 
 They would shoot and don't think about it, won't even blink about it 
 Go home, lay on momma breast nigga, drink about it 
 So while you huff and you puff like you rough and tough 
 Your ass turn to a bitch once you in the cuffs 
 Put your guns down, shoot a few rounds 
 Fifty-two blocks, put that ass on the ground 
 Rocket launcher on my shoulder, world's gettin' colder 
 Hood's like Iraq and I'm just a soldier 
 Nobody understands me, not even my family 
 Most important man on the planet still they ban me 
 Instead of givin' praises and revealin? a Grammy 
 They'd rather see me stressed out concealin? my jammy 
 Hopin?, I got smoked out and broke like Sammy 
 Spin the wheel of fortune then get struck with a whammy 
 Never that black, I got my act together 
 How can hip hop be dead when Wu-Tang is forever? 
 Put your guns down, shoot a few rounds 
 Fifty-two blocks, put that ass on the ground 
 Rocket launcher on my shoulder, world's gettin' colder 
 Hood's like Iraq and I'm just a soldier 
 Put your guns down, shoot a few rounds 
 Fifty-two blocks, put that ass on the ground 
 Rocket launcher on my shoulder, world's gettin' colder 
 Hood's like Iraq and I'm just a soldier
