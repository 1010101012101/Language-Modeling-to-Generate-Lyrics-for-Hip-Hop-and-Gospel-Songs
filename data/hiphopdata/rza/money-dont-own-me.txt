My woman and my money don't own me 
 I've got to keep holdin' my own 
 Heaven, heaven 
 The dangerous dynamite dosage, mind full of explosives 
 Digital brain is the closest to Moses 
 Civilizin? came, the flame inside the holster 
 Revitalize the game, the name's on the poster 
 The mask with no cape, the flash'll crush grapes 
 The dancer on the lap, the ass with no face 
 It's shaped like an ace, say your grace before you taste it 
 Haste makes waste, slow down or you may waste it 
 The bunny in the car look like an Indian squall 
 The honey's in the jar, the money's in the bra 
 It's funny ha ha ha, how dummies, ha ha ha 
 Think 'cause we call 'em sunny they can be a star 
 I implement the instrument, disintegrate the 10 percent 
 You entered the square but you don't know where the circle went 
 You ain't worth the cent, you cursed, I birthed the Prince 
 Drenched the baby from creators that the nurses sent 
 You can't still convent, don't have seven cents 
 Grave the raven, my birds are heaven sent 
 Where the brethren went? Where the Reverend went? 
 I told you these words are heaven sent 
 My woman and my money don't own me 
 I've got to keep holdin' my own 
 It's time to show you how them rugged MC's rock 
 If that's steel you see, it's that steel I pop 
 If that Benz I want, it's that Benz I got 
 Who rock them white tees first, get a West Cost props 
 Can't nobody do it better than the West Coast veteran 
 Three six letterman, Monk's the name 
 Black Knights the gang, I'll ignite the flames 
 Strike my hood up on the wall and cross out your name 
 With a K on the end of it, that won't be the end of it 
 Till them guns is drawn and you standin? on the end of it 
 Poof be gone, I'ma write that wrong 
 I'm the shit all by myself, nobody writes my song 
 Peep my technique, strictly gangsta classics 
 Gun talk nigga, muthafuck theatrics 
 My flow is matchless, ain't no way you could surpass this 
 Level I'm on, better go home and try to practice 
 Why yes, am I next to impress 
 D T S, bless the best, no cess 
 Stress from guess to gold press 
 The quest to protest, we head the Pro-Keds 
 But this is the new improved shit 
 '08 from the AMG, '92, bitch 
 My woman and my money don't own me 
 I've got to keep holdin' my own 
 Keep holdin'?, keep holdin'? 
 Keep holdin'?, keep holdin'?, no
