Oh Bobby why do you treat me so bad... 
 You know I love you 
 (Hook: Intrigue) 
 But why do some it wasn't me 
 But why do some in front of me 
 Oh baby baby you was acting so shady 
 I thought that you were stickin' me 
 Another girl your tricking me 
 I gotta go 'cause I thought that I was yo' baby 
 But why do some it wasn't me 
 But why do some in front of me 
 Oh baby baby you was acting so crazy 
 I thought that you were stickin' me 
 Another girl your tricking me 
 I gotta go 'cause I thought that you were my baby 
 (RZA) 
 Girl you can't trick me 
 Nor can you stick me 
 You try to play slickly said you strictly dickly 
 But you and your friends you play the licky licky 
 I figured it out when I caught that hickey 
 Between yo' legs with yo' chocolate splippy 
 Now bob busy gotta taught you like Frisbee 
 Out the window 
 Off and away you go 
 'Ain't got no time and no love for hoes, fuck 
 How many project sluts wanna nut or get touched? 
 And ramped up in the back of my truck 
 Or to eat the Benz up when yo' girlfriend would 
 Have her knees to her ears so I can slip in good 
 Bobby 
 Now walk the block with black hoody hat 
 Dog on the prowl upon to snatch the little putty-cat 
 Red red riding hood 
 And I'm the big woof 
 'Bout to puff off these pistols like I'm George Bush 
 And push push through your power-u 
 Goosh goosh explode my load 
 Have it running down your toosh toosh 
 Now you speakin' the round like a crook crook 
 Tryin' to look inside my phone book book 
 Bout to lose it all girl you shook shook 
 It 'Ain't my fault that your love got jooks jooks 
 It 'Ain't my fault that your love got jooks jooks 
 It 'Ain't my fault that your love got jooks 
 (Beretta 9) 
 C'mon man save it go ahead with that boo 
 Oh you take me for a fool 
 I shit my sister for you 
 Claim on sneakin' sleepin' creepin' cheatin' you buggin' yo 
 Listenin' to yo' cuzin' now because she a lonely hoe 
 Siffle fickle minded dizzy tryin' to insult I 
 Now you wanna go and turn around and to ask why 
 Peace be out bounce 
 Spread yo' wings fly 
 Me loud c'mon how? 
 That ain't god's style 
 C'mon man 
 You don't know me by now? 
 Three years in 
 I should of messed around but somehow 
 I kept it real 
 Girl I was ya' nigga' until 
 Ya switched the whole current 
 And if that's how you feel 
 Be out 
 Be out yo' 
 Be the fuck out 
 Oh Bobby why do you treat me so bad ... You know I love you
