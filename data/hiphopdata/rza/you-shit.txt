 What the fuck y'all birds talkin' about 
 Get the fuck out my house 
 Before I grab you by your hair and slap dick to your mouth 
 Bob digi 
 Yeah you know who is he 
 Girl I fuckin' slave trade your ass like Kizzy Kinte 
 You wish you could fuck 
 Bitch all you could do is dick suck 
 Fuck that 
 You don't cook you don't clean 
 Or press my jeans 
 You don't scrub or wash clothes 
 Or buy food 
 Or make any cream in this bitch 
 No weave to the seas 
 All you do is watch TV and smoke weed 
 Get your nails done feet scrubbed and hair weaved 
 Sleep all day 
 Eat gain weight 
 Can't breathe 
 Talkin' about you gonna leave 
 Then bitch leave 
 What the fuck you waitin for 
 Hit the door 
 I ain't takin' this shit no more 
 Takin' all my cream with gucci biddies and coach 
 Before you moved in my last, bitch ain't never seen a roach 
 Stains on my carpet 
 Bathroom smell like a fish market 
 Take all the space in my closet 
 Where the fucks your logic? 
 Disrespected my old earth 
 Aborted my child-birth 
 Everyday I catch my credit card Inside your purse 
 You can't speak a sentence without a curse 
 Talkin' about you gonna be a nurse 
 Bitch to be a nurse you gotta go to school first 
 When I first met you you were a hoe 
 I tried to reform you 
 Palm you, warn you 
 Teach you and couldn't reach you 
 But you still a hoe 
 Your father said you were a hoe 
 And when you leave me 
 Bitch you gonna be a hoe 
 Cellulite and gargoyle feet 
 Id rather beat my meat 
 Then ragged ass pussy a starvin dog wouldn't eat 
 Started with the body of a model 
 Pussy tight as a pharmacutacle bottle 
 And could swallow a whole avocado 
 And two forty ounce bottles 
 To the end of the world with you I would follow 
 Now when I fuck you the shit echo 'cause your pussy is so hollow 
 Turn your fat ass sideways 
 Strech marks look like the US highways 
 Fuck a new nigga every Friday 
 Talkin' about bust a nut 
 Bitch Ill bust your guts 
 You wonder why I cum so quick 
 With that wide ass pussy and saggy tits 
 I'm tryin' to get the shit over with 
 And go to sleep 
 But when I'm with my real freak on the weekend 
 Baby we fuck for about two and a half hours to three 
 You better steady the one to fourteen dollars of coachin the green 
 About MGT and GCC 
 'Cause you ain't shit 
 And your mother ain't shit 
 And your sister ain't shit 
 Your pussy ain't shit 
 That weave ain't shit 
 Your ass ain't shit 
 Girl you ain't shit 
 Your daddy ain't shit
