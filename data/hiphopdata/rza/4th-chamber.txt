Choose the sword, and you will join me 
 Choose the ball, and you join your mother, in death 
 You don't understand my words, but you must choose 
 So, come boy, choose life or death 
 The only man I hold wake for 
 Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in eighty-three, rocked Taylor's 
 My Memorex performed tape decks, my own phone sex 
 Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex 
 Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with rac-coons 
 Corner sittin' wine niggaz sippin Apple Boone, this ain't no white cartoon 
 'Cause I be duckin' crazy spades 
 The kid hold white shit, like blacks rock ashy legs 
 Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet? 
 Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept? Stand up 
 You're out of luck like two dogs stuck 
 Iron Man be sippin' rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable 
 Noriega, aimin' knives which stay windy in Chicago 
 Spine-tingle, mind boggles 
 Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough 
 Give me mine before Po, wrap you up in so-and-so 
 I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine and great Henry the Eighth 
 Built with Ghengis Khan, the wreck suede wiley Don 
 I judge wisely, as if nothin' ever surprise me 
 Loungin', between two pillars of ivory 
 I'm lively, my dome piece, is like buildin' stones in Greece 
 My poems are deep from ancient thrones I speak 
 I'm overwhelmed, as my mind, roams the realm 
 My eye's the vision, memory is the film 
 Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above clouds 
 They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd 
 No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit 
 Clutch they fists, and throw up signs like a Crip 
 And throw all types of fits 
 I leave 'em split, like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips 
 Aiyyo, camoflouge chameleon, ninjas scalin' your buildin' 
 No time to grab the gun they already got your wife and children 
 A hit was sent, from the President, to rage your residence 
 Because you had secret evidence, and documents 
 On how they raped the continents, and it's the prominent 
 Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew 
 The year two thousand and two, the battle's filled with the Wu 
 Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu 
 Or the Ebola Virus, under the reign of King Cyrus 
 You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris 
 Un-loyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes 
 Of hot oil, it boils your skin, chicken heads gettin' slim 
 Like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil 
 Fortified with essential, vitamin and mineral 
 Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow 
 Rollin' with the Lands, the tribe's a hundred and forty four thousand chosen 
 Protons electrons always cause explosions 
 The banks of G, all CREAM downs a vet 
 Money feed good, opposites off the set 
 It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree 
 I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed 
 I'm on some tax free shit by any means 
 Whether bound to hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM 
 I learned much from such with cons who run scams 
 Veterans got the game spiced like hams 
 And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn 
 Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn 
 Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength 
 That made me truncate the limp on temp 
 With the stump, treat his hips like air pumps 
 RZA shaped the track, niggaz caught razor bumps 
 Scarred tryin' to figure who invented 
 This unprecented, opium-scented, dark-tinted 
 Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues 
 'Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fuse
