Now, it's the master's turn though 
 I'm betting in, well, there's a show here 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step, kid 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step 
 Watch your step, kid, watch your step, yo, yo, yo 
 We take your wizzes away like we be called on 
 Deep in space like the Millennium Falcon 
 Y'all be fools, scored like ancient Babylon 
 Rabbits and turtles, all run the marathon 
 Yup, y'all paper chasing, y'all human racing 
 Who got the best basement? 
 You got a 6SL, I got a SSL 
 I score movies, make Supreme Clientele 
 Oh, here I am again 
 (My Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack) 
 No, can't get it near, I quit 
 (My Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack) 
 All day, all night 
 What brings to you life for you in the world 
 (My Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack) 
 Silly rabbits, tryna disrespect the Abbott 
 Don't you know that we'll turn your cold body to maggots 
 I got forty million records sold, some platinum, some gold 
 Some we just put out to meet the tax code 
 Your career will be shorter than the 21st of December 
 Be one of those thousand rappers, no one remembers 
 While my name is carved on trophies, colleges recite my bars 
 You can look up and see my name upon the stars 
 And when it comes down to that basic talent 
 I got 20 little cousins that can meet your challenge 
 Yo, stop and listen and check this proposition 
 Son, got lots of vision plus lots of wisdom 
 Hindsight, foresight, insight, out of sight 
 Some try to imitate but they are not alike 
 They only piggy back, have a Digi snack 
 That Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack 
 Oh, here I am again 
 (My Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack) 
 No, can't get it near, I quit 
 (My Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack) 
 All day, all night 
 What brings to you life for you in the world 
 (My Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack) 
 We're just dealing of a man 
 Tough take before you, a cryptic to your power 
 The reason why we slept and spared your son's life 
 Was to give you faith 
 Thank you, man, thank you 
 You fight well, the hand must reach to the sky 
 Save the best for me and have perfect breathing 
 Good breath control, you know of these 
 Oh, here I am again 
 (My Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack) 
 No, can't get it near, I quit 
 (My Wu-Tang slang is that New York City crack) 
 All day, all night 
 What brings to you life for you in the world
