(Holocaust, (Ms. Roxy)) 
 (Bobby Digital), Wu-Tang Killer Bees 
 (It's all about Bobby, I'm floatin in your galaxy) 
 You fallin' down a endless tunnel of doom reality 
 Graphically, my killer bee family stings the galaxy 
 Insanity, titanium stomach, devouring Guinness 
 My flesh is solid stone despite my outer appearance 
 Still diseased, kill viruses, planets and racial creatures 
 Made MC's sprout tumors so bad, lost facial features 
 Waste your peoples, left out in the rain, fountains of pain 
 Eighty shots to the mouth and the brain, shoutin my name 
 Holocaust, black man, whose veins littered with thorns 
 Back-smack you so hard, all your seeds will be born deformed 
 Swarm dorms, sting birds, fling verbs like mean curbs 
 Strike three, mics flee, I infect 'em with green germs, ringworm 
 'Cause I'm filthy and guilty, dastardly, mastery 
 My felony melody has to be a bastards masterpiece 
 Start graftin' me, chump-ass niggaz eyein' me, temp me 
 I'll break it down simply, I'm horrifyingly empty 
 Spittin' darts on the tip of a glacier used for my hide-out 
 Rock crusher German suplex, watch spines slide out 
 The side route, Forearm bash with twenty jabs on the ave 
 Or your lab, get stabbed in bloodied bad 
 While, I'm sippin herbal teas, verbal bees plant fertile seeds 
 Bitches leave with broke backs, swollen palms and purple knees 
 Circle thieves like vultures in deserts rest on a cactus 
 Got oscar nominee MC's stuck to my hatchet 
 Drastic, indescribable pain, I injure bars 
 While, Bobby's throwin' razor CD's like ninja stars 
 (Rza) 
 Chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chhhhh 
 Yo, yo, yo, dropped down a man-hole, yo, a rap ammo 
 Blows out your candle, check, yo 
 Dropped down a man-hole, a rap ammo 
 Blows out your candle, have Wu-Tang tagged up on your tombstone by Ganno 
 Release the info, 4-4 increase your heart tempo 
 Scared your ass, you jumped through a closed window 
 To a hundred beats per a second, my mic's secret weapon 
 Infertiate your style to that of Led Zeppelin 
 Encyclopedia Brittanica, Hanna Barbera, world of super adventure 
 Couldn't give a proper word on the scripture of my manner 
 You're just a flicker to my inferno, we burn for eternal 
 MC's delight - popcorn, we poppin' every kernel 
 Jot us in your journal, we hot like a thermal 
 Nuclear explosion, under my control of your country 
 Like the Federal Enforcement Management Agency 
 My technique, be vocabulary freak 
 Recite for state, my divine is like Dante's Peak 
 At most, you'll be trapped off in PatMoss 
 Get smacked in the back of your neck with the black toast 
 King Cobra, back blew back and bare foot 
 On the roof dusted out, waitin for carriers 
 Poppin' like Orville Reddenbacher or Betty Crocker 
 The pop secret is the forty-five glock popper 
 Control men like rats that's controlled by Ben or Willard 
 American Express privelages, blood spillage 
 We got more balls then village 
 Star-spangled banner, soldier stand up 
 Cobra commander, stop the propaganda 
 Thirty shot banana clip, full-loaded, radar scanners get decoded 
 Digital warfare torments your head, eye's bloated 
 Nexus floated, poison darts quoted 
 American eagle stingin up blue Beetle Bailey 
 On the wine mixed with Hennessey daily 
 Keep thee scaly, Israeli niggaz from the clan 
 We bide the omish that'll harness the promised land 
 (Dr. Doom) 
 Yo, yo, yo, you can't escape from the Dr. of Doom 
 My lyrics bloom on bafoons and take flight like witches brooms 
 That full moon on all you dumb-dumbs 
 Watch your filthy rise away like soap scum 
 The war-lord swingin' flamin swords just like a shogun 
 Of the darkness, my scriptures cause arches like flamin archmen 
 My killer bee sting remains accurate like a marksman 
 So, tape with caution, we attack like black martians 
 Corner of the market, by usin' digital strategies 
 Reefer sparks my acid battery, y'all niggaz flatter me 
 With all that tough talk, I drop bombs like Mookie Blaylock 
 >From the outside or the inside, create intense rides 
 When my pen glides all MC's will get they heads flied 
 For talkin' shit, lyrics always strike throughout my dungeon pit 
 Killer bees must reign supreme throughout the continent 
 We conquered it, mother fuckers 
 (Ghostface Killah) 
 Eh yo, the beat terminal, exquisite young coolie high production 
 Caught up in the hollow-head suction 
 Ten pogo sticks, two black-belts that break bricks 
 Diet coke meetin's with the rich 
 I'm faithfully married to rap 
 We've been engaged for twelve years 
 Tyson bite Holyfield ear 
 We love the sport, look out your window 
 Now see, pull up to say, y'all be amazed me 
 Tony Starks, spaceship, ran by a daughter's cellar 
 Only man out, walked through hell 
 Dick swingin' like shit went well 
 Call it the mighty Joe Young 
 Double-swirl slush, Wonder Woman, sapphire shit with the pearls 
 It looked real nice, yo, heavy on the gravy 
 Third, bag a secretary in the glaze, he tagged eighty words 
 From Whirl-winds to whirl-pools, see wise watch the earth spin 
 Sunny-dance with the serpent, who shot JJ and it's my bone 
 The same nigga ridin' the train, same nigga with his name on the jacket 
 Switch to chaseable, inhaled the bad bag of that Jason 
 Fell out twice in the basement 
 Straight up and down, y'all
