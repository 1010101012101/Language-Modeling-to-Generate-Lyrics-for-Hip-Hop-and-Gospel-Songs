My puglistic linguistic rapping 
 Is a mixture of slug 'em in 
 Slug 'em in 
 Plug 'em in plug 'em in 
 Come to spread it 
 The world exclusive 
 Check it 
 From the underground producers 
 Turn your face stone like Medusa 
 Slap dick on a wicked pitch 
 Sons 
 Those who burn hurt turn nuns 
 I be jumpin' through the flame 
 With the name B.O.B.B.Y. 
 Makin' a hobby 
 Smoke the honey dip got my throat groggy 
 You doo-doo brain dirtbag derelict dumbfuck 
 What the fuck is wrong with you dickhead? 
 Numb-nuts 
 Just because you made a song or two 
 What's the balance due on your royalties? 
 Record companies spoil me 
 As the, hot oil me 
 Fuck that savage back up 
 Wu-Tang step inside the club 
 Niggas might act up 
 One potato 
 Smack you like the crossfader 
 Rap data, the elevators 
 Escape the projects, livin' inside the skyscraper 
 Fuck that I'm takin' back the forty acres 
 Nature 
 (Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby) 
 (Huh) 
 Yo, my Eve called 1-Adam-12, I got arrested 
 At first she protested 
 But only the seventh son of, had the power 
 Before the Midori Sour with red cherries 
 Hereditary trait, seeking salvation like the Cranberries 
 Wrote Murder with Angela Lansbury often 
 Till my biological clock stops and my casket falls 
 We sell tix <Celtics> like Boston basketball 
 See-arson was askin' y'all 
 Is Ras Kass the last to fall victim for wearin' no mask at all? 
 No gimmicks, just me bein' me 
 But you ain't bendin' or offendin' me 
 Cause anyways Hennessy used to be a better friend to me 
 But I had to stop drinkin' so many pints (Why?) 
 Cause the tendency to forget 
 It ain't baseball, America's favorite national pastime is white 
 Supremacy 
 Never seen a nigga granted clemency 
 My metaphors is meta-five 
 My styles go up in your, little boy, you get fucked, like pedophiles 
 When it's all said and done I'ma retire to an island in the Caymans 
 Enslavin' Caucasians livin' off your mama's life savings 
 I take it all in stride 
 Dennis Rodman's laced to the side 
 This nigga glide, like Clyde 
 My hands was tied 
 Silent cries screamed genocide 
 When two-thirds of the planet died in the end 
 The end justifies the means 
 The end is power 
 (Power) Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely 
 Young black man, let us begin [Repeat x2]
