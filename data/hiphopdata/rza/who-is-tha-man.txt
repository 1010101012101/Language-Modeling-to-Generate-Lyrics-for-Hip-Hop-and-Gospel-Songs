(Sample:) "Who is, the man?" 
 (Reverend William Burke) 
 Heavy metal blast devils, shovels bury devils 
 I travel through lower levels, killing demons and rebels 
 With petals, musical crack that settles in your veins 
 Embezzle's get sold, and sizzles your beautiful brain 
 The Reverend Burke will maintain, even though he insane 
 And he'll spit flames and lick shots off like Jesse James 
 I feel the pain like I'm locked in a chain gang 
 And bang on the railroad frame so you can ride the train 
 (Sample:) "Who is, the man?" 
 (Chorus 2X: Reverend William Burke) 
 I sold all my money, gave away food when I was hungry 
 And prayed for enemies who didn't love me 
 But trust me, God appreciate it when you live humbely 
 Satan smile like it's funny, but buddy, Allah don't like ugly 
 (Sample:) "Who is, the man?" 
 (Reverend William Burke) 
 Bust back and clap, or get ya wig cracked, in fact 
 We all strapped with macs, but still scrap, 'cause it's like that 
 So put the gat down, nah Jack, put yours on the ground first, reverse the attack 
 In combat, we don't back down, the Chi is that town 
 Where them girls hit the track and make stacks pound 
 Even cops get slap 'round, get caught round 
 The wrong part of town, a wrong project building 
 It's elementary that eventually I'mma see the penetentiary 
 They picking off my family tree 
 We live an O.G., G's up, snitches down lifestyle 
 Gambino gangstas who keep a low profile 
 (Sample:) "Who is, the man?" 
 (Sample:) "Who is, the man?"
