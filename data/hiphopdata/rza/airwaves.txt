We interrupt your program to bring you 
 *Alot of static* 
 This is a Wu-Tang Killa Bee exclusive blast 
 *Echoing* 
 Wake up, wake up, wake up 
 Wu-tang, Wu-Tang, 
 Wu-tang, Wu-Tang, 
 Wu-tang, Wu-Tang... 
 Verse 1: Bobby Digital 
 Bobby Steels fables till 
 MCs get your lips stapled 
 Project Killa Hill 
 Is stamped on the map like the compass 
 Taking sword play tongue-twist piercing holes in you 
 You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts 
 Blast in your box walk wid alarm clocks 
 Cars drive explodes on the block 
 One stop parks, pops in trunk 
 Snears pop loud as glock shots 
 Pierced like a earring in your face 
 Cops stop, give a sitation 
 Report for radio station identification 
 *Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up* 
 Love IQ got you drunk, you depressed of Wu 
 Flying monks fatal darts from your airwaves strike you antenna 
 You feeled a bit shimmer 
 It makes you're like you dimmer 
 You thought you turned your dial from this 
 You best to slit your wrists 
 Through the soul of your heart like dark Emelius 
 Unfamiliar, leave no trace like Simon Templer 
 Rhyme emperor, styles switch daily like temperature 
 In your atmosphere the rap racketeer 
 Six pack battery back keep 'em stacked 
 I live for hip-hop 
 And tall brown skin sugar plum who love the lollipos 
 Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up 
 Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang 
 Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
