It's hard for me to leave out 
 U call for me more I define more 
 Nuh moture 
 See me G.O.Ds 
 See me K.A.Ds 
 Nuh gotta leave 
 Nuh gotta leave 
 Stop blowing trees for my sleaps 
 See I'm living cross the streat 
 U're hot in my links 
 Stay with me 
 Stay with me for a little while. 
 Won't you stay with me 
 Stay with me for a little while. 
 Baby don't go no where 
 'Cause I need you here. 
 Won't you stay with me 
 Stay with me for a little while. 
 U could tell me that you love me and you care. 
 U ain't go no where 
 U gonna stay right here. 
 Stay with me 
 Stay with me for a little while. 
 'Cause I'm waiting till so fading for ur love to 
 Bring me up 
 To the place in love. 
 Stay with me 
 Stay with me for a little while. 
 Won't you stay with me 
 Stay with me for a little while. 
 Baby don't go no where 
 'Cause I need you here. 
 Won't you stay with me 
 Stay with me for a little while. 
 U could tell me you love me boy. 
 Why you at the door 
 U don't love me no more. 
 Sittin' around and talkin' about what we gonna be 
 We are family but how we gonna lay it down 
 Stay with me 
 Stay with me for a little while. 
 Won't you stay with me 
 Stay with me for a little while 
 Baby don't go no where 
 'Cause I need you here 
 Won't you stay with me 
 Stay with me for a little while 
 Stay with me
