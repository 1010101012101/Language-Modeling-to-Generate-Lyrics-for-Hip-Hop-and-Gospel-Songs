(RZA and Diaz conversating on a boat) 
 (RZA) 
 Yeah, this some good motherfuckin weed man, fo real 
 Niggaz got me out here on the Norwegian sea 
 Yo Diaz, I'm sayin' what, we gone see a whale fo real? 
 (Diaz) Of course, of course

 (Diaz) When we get that motherfucker, kill 'em

 (Diaz) We gone eat that shit 
 (RZA) Oh, ya'all niggaz eat whales? 
 (Diaz) Hell yeah 
 (RZA) 
 Nah nah, I can't, I can't kill no whales 
 Oh man, I heard thet were here before us man 
 What the fuck is that right there comin' close and shit 
 Oh we gone se Moby Dick 
 (Diaz) Finn fram harpunen'a. (Find the harpoon) 
 (RZA) 
 Hey damn, hey yo, nigga, one right there 
 Oh shit, oh oh, hold on nigga hold on, hold on 
 (The beat starts) 
 (Diaz) 
 D-I-A-Z 
 And the R-Z-A 
 Yo yo yo yo 
 I'ma turn my aim up, 'cause I spit overseas now 
 My head's supplece now, got a new rease now 
 I've been local, but my rep's gonna increase now 
 Prevent that, find ya self in a tight squeeze now 
 I really feel, we all need some hip-hop police now 
 It's all about C's now, too many MC's now 
 Please now listen, I'm takin' somebodys place 
 Fuck who that be, ya'all cats can't hold it like me 
 Though I'm not from no famous, borough or state 
 I've spent years in this shit, more than eight 
 I'm more than great, I cross more borders than weight 
 I serve you 24/7, ya'all can order this shit late 
 And choose the language too, just go ahead 
 You want Norwegian or the Spanish row instead 
 Toma, para los que pueren entender (Spanish) 
 Till de som står og ler, vi får bent dem ner (Norwegian) 
 (=For those who are standin there laughin', we bend them down) 
 Nei (=no), I can't compare, ya'all shit this hot 
 Y'all can't flow like Diaz, or make peace like RZA 
 (Chorus) (RZA) 
 Ta ra ratta Ta ra ra ratta 
 Yo, yo 
 We like to get, get high 
 Chase ????, chop 
 Ski, feel the breeze 
 Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea 
 (Diaz) 
 Heard ya'all MC's talk alot, let's get back to this 
 I don't know if ya know this, but ya facts are twist 
 Up and coming motherfuckers just act as if 
 What they need to learn about is what practice is 
 Ya'all should get a teacher, who you lack is Chris 
 It be funny to see how you react to this 
 I'm like that +Activist+, I run up with bombs 
 While screamin 'fuck rap', with C-4 in both palms 
 I keep spittin' after I blew off both arms 
 RZA came through, I'm used to flow over tarms 
 Beef that is, I'm tryin' to reach these kids 
 Go head to head with these labels, beat their bids 
 Do whatever it taes, I never shit slide 
 Bout to switch on they ass like Jekyll to Hyde 
 Nobody takes me for a ride, put it to side 
 That's not an option, time for me to go outside 
 Hard to knock loose, cool with that much pride 
 God's my witness, I don't got too much to hide 
 That wasent the truth, Virgin Mary would I cry? 
 Peeped it with closed gates and I've would've fried 
 We like to get, get high 
 Smoke, smoke, lah, lah 
 Trees, and feel the breeze 
 Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea 
 I might, get my, my big, big G-A-T 
 And start the squeeze, 16 shots at you crab MC'z 
 Nigga, we can get high, high 
 Chase ????, chop 
 Ski, feel the breeze 
 Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea 
 I might get, get my, my big 
 And squeeze 16 at you ????? rappers wanna touch my team 
 Nigga, we smoke, smoke lah, lah 
 Can, can get, get high 
 Ski, feel the breeze 
 Y'all can't fuck with this cat from the northeren sea
