(Intro: RZA, (Beretta 9)) 
 Yo, what up, dunn, (yo, yo, yo) 
 Aiyyo, peace, yo, what up, dunn 
 (Word, just watching the studio 
 Got all the word on the street) 
 What you was outside yesterday 
 (For a minute went to the store, you know) 
 Caught them cats at store 
 Some bugged out shit was going on last night 
 Fucking with them niggaz off the av. and shit 
 You know (word) niggaz be bugging out there 
 (Yo, what's the word on the street) 
 Yo, fuck that, yo 
 (RZA, (Beretta 9)) 
 I heard cops raided the weed spot and four deep 
 They backed two dreads in the eighty ?gymtory? 
 You know who I mean, he moved from shaolin to queens 
 Fronting like he was down with the escobar team 
 (I heard t.t. got shot in the ass for some wiz 
 And binky caught two to the ass, but, yo, he lived) 
 And plus little duck and love, they got busted 
 (Tell them niggaz, don't be slinging while they dusted) 
 See, me little cousin shawn and his man royce 
 (Yeah, shawn broke his arm on the basketball court) 
 Word, his sister febe got cut off from welfare 
 And those two nappy head kids got sent back to child care 
 Bastard, he got slapped by ?mouth gib? 
 Acting like he had an arm to take in his crib 
 (Yeah, that faggot ass nigga caught that beef from his rib) 
 It's the projects, dunn, you got one life to live 
 (Murder, caught 2-4, homicide) 
 Mental rhyme disorder shit but never testified 
 Hold on, god, chill, my other line 
 (Make it fast, kid, don't have me on hold for a long time 
 It's twenty cents a call and I only got a dime 
 It's hot on the block and I'm surrounded by crime) 
 Yo, aiyyo, chica-check the draw that was my little niggaz hama 
 He said he just got some power-u from your niece tanya
