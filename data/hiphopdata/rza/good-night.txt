Ah, love is love honey, yeah 
 Digi, Digi, bong, bong, bangin' you long 
 Whop, pop, who pop, then bang bang boom 
 Shabobalee, shabizzy 
 Good night, here's your kiss 
 Sleep well and make a wish 
 Don't be scared, I won't bite 
 I keep you warm and hold you tight 
 Good night, here's your kiss 
 Sleep well and make a wish 
 Don't be scared, I won't bite 
 I keep you warm and hold you tight 
 Your dynamite antics drove me to your magic 
 Merrily down the stream, you got me goin' frantic 
 Enchanted by your kiss, the apple's gigantic 
 In your Atlantic abyss I'ma sink my Titanic 
 Granted your wish to be captured on candid camera 
 Oh shit, I got to pamper you 
 With this hand trick gambit, open handed 
 Edible panties, no need for the hamper 
 We can spread out on the floor like Pampers 
 Chantin? Karma Sutra, you got me speakin'? Spanglish 
 Mamacita, fuck semantics 
 Goddamn it, you understand it? 
 I'm about to blow like somebody pushed the panic 
 You fever the gene that Yaqub sub-planted 
 Shape and mold ya body just like ceramics 
 Big valley rodeo style, above to stand with 
 Dream, dream, cream, cream 
 Legs open, I'm in between 
 You squelch and scream, I split your gene 
 My chi, my yi, my shit, my jig 
 My lee, my con, crown me Kong King 
 Bottles of Ginseng, Jamaican ting 
 Wood root, it's the ultra sheen 
 Your flower bein? blossomed, pollinate like Spring 
 Good night, here's your kiss 
 Sleep well and make a wish 
 Don't be scared, I won't bite 
 I keep you warm and hold you tight 
 Good night, here's your kiss 
 Sleep well and make a wish 
 Don't be scared, I won't bite 
 I keep you warm and hold you tight 
 Love, love, love is in the air, fireplaces, winter time 
 Bottles of wine, cuddled up with a friend of mine 
 She a dime and in her physical prime 
 So every time we grind, she get a chill up her spine 
 Sign is Virgo, she from Chicago 
 She like my slow flow and like my turbo 
 I'm like yo, we can burn the herbal 
 I got the purple and you in my circle 
 By them hips I can tell she fertile 
 So I'ma take my time and as slow as a turtle 
 And I like her verbals, that wine she gurgle 
 Got her actin' terrible 
 And that ass is durable 
 Had her bent over in the Bentley convertible 
 The girl was beautiful, my flow was surgical 
 And now I'm preferable 
 Good night, here's your kiss 
 Sleep well and make a wish 
 Don't be scared, I won't bite 
 I keep you warm and hold you tight 
 Good night, here's your kiss 
 Sleep well and make a wish 
 Don't be scared, I won't bite 
 I keep you warm and hold you tight 
 When tonight chime, I taste your kiss 
 I make a wish, for you 
 When tonight chime, I feel your kiss 
 I make your dreams come true 
 She was gorgeous, wit ass that make you cum fast like Porsches 
 Face look like a portrait, body like a fortune 
 Mills in small bills and tall heels, flexin? sex appeal 
 Got my mind ponderin?, wonderin? how the sex would feel 
 First to kill she'd be an assassin, main part of her attraction 
 Was her sense of fashion, stopped her and asked her name 
 Complimented her elegance, she blushed, respond with intelligence 
 Her scent was heaven sent 
 Offered me a drink, beautiful with dead presidents 
 A few drinks later, we back at her residence 
 Surprised and 35, I was deep between her thighs 
 When she came she cried, looked me deep in my eyes and said 
 Good night, here's your kiss 
 Sleep well and make a wish 
 Don't be scared, I won't bite 
 I keep you warm and hold you tight 
 Good night, here's your kiss 
 Sleep well and make a wish 
 Don't be scared, I won't bite 
 I keep you warm and hold you tight
