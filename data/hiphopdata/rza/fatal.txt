Blade, ready to die? 
 I was born ready motherfucker 
 (Whispered) 
 Daywalker... 
 Yo, yo, yo, 
 It's the feast of the blood resin, 
 Unleash the beast within, 
 I walk around, with the strength of a hundred men, 
 You best to run before I count to ten, 
 Blood drippin from my canine, like a fountain pen, 
 It seems I've been asleep for a thousand years, 
 The way my water change it bring me a thousand tears, 
 Prince of darkness, they walk through the rays of light, 
 To this beat a vampire, I'm the prototype, 
 The shape shifting mirror image flash photo type, 
 To everlasting original red blood-o-type 
 (Abstract 1 - King) 
 He was born perfect, 
 And just like the great white shark, 
 This guy has never had to evolve 
 (Chrous x2) 
 Try to use my name, that's fatal, 
 Try to claim my fame, (for) that's fatal, 
 About to brave the pain, that's fatal, 
 Bite through your jugular vein, that's fatal, 
 Come on, walk with me, 
 Come on, walk with me, 
 Come on, walk with me, 
 Walk with me, 
 Come on, walk with me, 
 Come on, walk with me, 
 Come on, walk with me, 
 Walk with me, 
 Come on, walk with me, 
 (Abstract 2 - Blade) 
 You're not immortal, 
 I must have heard hundreds of rodents make the same claim, 
 Each one of them have tasted the end of my sword, 
 I strike back with a vengeance, 
 The father of your descendants, 
 And I can't be deflected, by your silver cross pendants, 
 Bloody holy water, you make the false images, 
 Once waiting for the sickle, ah your life dimminishes 
 Sting like the scorpion, strike with the force of ten, 
 My blood is known to revitalise the corpse of men, 
 In the last days they say the dead will walk again, 
 The blind deaf and the dumb will talk again 
 Try to use my name, that's fatal, 
 Try to claim my fame, (for) that's fatal, 
 About to brave the pain, that's fatal, 
 Bite through your jugular vein, that's fatal
