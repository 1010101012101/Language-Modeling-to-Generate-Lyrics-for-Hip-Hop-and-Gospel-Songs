(RZA) 
 Yo it's the sexcapades, the sexcapades 
 Baggin' ladies drive 'em crazy 
 That's my every day routine 
 Have 'em buggin' it sayin' they lovin' it (baby) 
 Saying, "Oh we love Rakeem" 
 And as I kiss 'em I just diss 'em 
 With a symptom of my love 
 And once they're afflicted 
 They're addicted 'cause they want you like a drug 
 (RZA) 
 So let me speak (speak) 
 On the code I seek 
 How many freaks can I bag in the course of a week? (Uh huh) 
 Yo check this 
 They trip with the quickness 
 The freak that we speak will walk out with swiftness 
 Once captivated (captivated) right 
 They become trapped to date it 
 Sexually enfactuated (By who) 
 By the stigma that this kid hooked 
 The brain 
 What this is the is sexcapades (Aight) 
 Episode 1 I'm down by the store 
 Saw a young girl that I wanted to explore 
 I said, "Peace, yo my name is Rakeem" 
 She replied, "Hi my name is Charlene" 
 "But all my friends they call me Cha Cha" 
 I said, "Word, then you can call me Ra Ra" (Ra Ra) 
 She said, "Ra are ya' rowdy?" 
 I said, "Naw that's not my style see" 
 But brothers run it true that have game (right) 
 Who like to lounge and get poo-tang 
 All night (Uh huh) 
 That was the end of a dramo 
 Now that you know go back in the condo 
 She had a grill like a night trick 
 The poo-tang pie braid and hat trick 
 Now the Ra was on a mission 
 I did the humpty hump in a vertical position 
 Baggin' ladies drive 'em crazy 
 That's my everyday routine (Word) 
 Have 'em buggin' this (Ra had 'em buggin') 
 Sayin' they lovin' this 
 Sayin', "Oh we love Rakeem" 
 And as I diss 'em I just kiss 'em 
 With a sympom of my love 
 And once they're afflicted 
 They're addicted (Rakeem) 
 'Cause they want you like a drug 
 (RZA) 
 Hey yo yo let's get on with the episode (episode) 
 Scene 2 I'm walkin' down Clove road 
 A day a gloomy day 
 A gray coat cover 
 No light because the sky was gray 
 But I was looking dope if I must so (You can say so) 
 But my gear was in it like Prego 
 And as I walk I saw up ahead of me a girl 
 Eyes gray green like a pedigree 
 And then and now I didn't want to pass that 
 I gave an eye so I could sweat her assests 
 She essential influential body potential 
 So another lover tied into 
 Yo but not a moment to waste 
 I slide over like I was flying the whole thing 
 Yes I was successful 
 Using my special 
 Wu-Tang slang that capture the brain 
 Next step was yes yep 
 Not to disrespect (Nope) 
 But I must protect my rep (You got to) 
 And after here I told her to entice me 
 She said it's too late 'cause she was a wify 
 I said, "Listen baby check it" 
 It's one or the other 
 Lier lover sucker or fucker 
 And guess which choice she chose? (Which one) 
 A brother had her lying in my bed with no clothes 
 And the Ra was all eyeing her 
 But you can save that nicey shit for your mama 
 DMD thinks I'm deadly (downtown) 
 And she sounds like cats in over...(Growl) 
 Baggin' ladies drive 'em crazy 
 That's my everyday routine (Yeah) 
 Have 'em buggin' this (Ra had 'em buggin'" 
 Sayin' they lovin' this 
 Sayin', "Oh we love Rakeem"
