(Intro: RZA) 
 Get your gun... 
 Yo, it's a samurai showdown, samurai showdown 
 (Aight, A.T.M) How dare you challenge me? 
 You will die from the tip of my sword today 
 Huh, the trenches, we must remain calm 
 Right, prepare to die 
 (Chorus: RZA (x2)) 
 Yo, it's born born, young lord, raise your swords 
 Yo, it's born born, young lord, raise your swords 
 (Verse 1: RZA) 
 Yo, yo Hailin from the slums of Shaolin, golden claw, talon twirl 
 And one swirl of the fatal sword splits your Island 
 WU killa bees stingers back on the swarm again 
 Zzzzzz, the alarm again, six direction weapon deflection 
 Bones connect like opposite sides of magnets 
 Steel fragments bein chipped off a singing sword slash 
 With the force of big crash in your dash board with no airbag 
 He drove a ninety nine Jaguar quick to pick a lock, lick a shot 
 Respect the bloods and crips a lot 
 Plus the god from ride saggin in his seat, blastin WU beats tryin' 
 To plot his next hit 
 He took a drag of the eight elements that composed, atmospheric gas 
 Bout to let off his sword, and full blast kept his mind focused, 
 Meditation position half lotus 
 ABBOT's sword novas couldn't match his magnum opus deluxe stroke, 
 Son move like a ghost 
 Struck in an instance, unnoticed like a lamp post 
 Radar sharp precision gunfire, explode till his clips unload, 
 It's a samurai code 
 It's born born, young lord, raise your swords (x5) 
 Time for everyone to go record 
 It's born born, young lord, raise your swords 
 Time for everyone to go record 
 (Verse 2: RZA) 
 Crept in silent, the steel wind 
 Chrome silencers screwed on tight kept the gunshots just sealed in 
 We attack, full fledge 
 With Chicago Bull red bandanas tied tight around our heads 
 Swing with the force of a sledge 
 Single-edge stainless steel blade chopped the wedge 
 Slit this analog derelicts head 
 Who even thought that 
 He could go against the truth and the gods and fall back? 
 From the will of Allah, you'll be facin the firing squad 
 Of a thousand archers out to mark ya 
 The bill top scully king blocks bullest like jelly beans 
 Birds in my nest restin up, on the telly scene 
 Murderousrap track to me, is ego felony can't accept what you analog 
 Cats be tellin' me 
 I get the verbal weapon, won't hesitate for one second to 
 Break your back like big jack from tekken 
 It's born born, young lord raise your swords 
 It's born born, young lord raise your swords (x2)
