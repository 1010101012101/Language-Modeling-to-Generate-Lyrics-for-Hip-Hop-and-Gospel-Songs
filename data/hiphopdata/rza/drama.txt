I wanna dedicate this song to the young god, Kareem 
 The Genius, Digi 
 Sing it to 'em van Seijen 
 Like to keep my head up to the sky 
 And ask myself why it has to be this way 
 I'd like to live my life in peace 
 And have not to worry about all the dramas of the day 
 As we strive for luxury and try to feed our families 
 It always seems that someone's in your way 
 I'd like to live my life in peace 
 And have not to worry about all the dramas of the day 
 I met a young brother about 28 
 Who seemed intelligent and rather quite straight 
 I greeted him and struck a conversation 
 To see if the youngster had some self-motivation 
 Peace brother, what's your name? How you be? 
 I'm Rugged Monk and I'm all about the currency 
 You mean gettin' paid? Yeah, like my man's brother 
 Who has a condo, he shares with his baby mother 
 You know a condo beats my apartment 
 With no lights, no gas and backed up rent 
 No hot water or heat, infested with plenty rats 
 That'll eat up the average alley cat 
 I'm like damn homey that's poverty he's like 
 Word O.G. that bothers me 
 Plus I'm about to be a new father G 
 We need to wise up and change the hood policy 
 Like to keep my head up to the sky 
 And ask myself why it has to be this way 
 I'd like to live my life in peace 
 And have not to worry about all the dramas of the day 
 As we strive for luxury and try to feed our families 
 It always seems that someone's in your way 
 I'd like to live my life in peace 
 And have not to worry about all the dramas of the day 
 Yo, why you fear the devil as a grown man? 
 Why you not out there tryin' to make your own plan? 
 See we are a victim of a situation 
 Where are wicked man, separated the nation 
 And got us killin' off one another 
 Black on black, they pit brother on brother 
 It's gettin' hot, hotter than July 
 See the murder and crime rate is risin' to the sky 
 For example, in my neighborhood it's so hot 
 I'm often woke up from the alarmin? soundin? of a shot 
 So I'm thinkin'?, what? Is your neighborhood a trap? 
 Could this be the place marked X on the map? 
 And I'm spotted like a target in a shootin? gallery 
 So I strive to seek for a better salary 
 So I can escape from where? From this ghetto life area 
 'Cause everyday it gets scarier 
 Like to keep my head up to the sky 
 And ask myself why it has to be this way 
 I'd like to live my life in peace 
 And have not to worry about all the dramas of the day 
 As we strive for luxury and try to feed our families 
 It always seems that someone's in your way 
 I'd like to live my life in peace 
 And have not to worry about all the dramas of the day
