(Feat. Beretta 9) 
 (Intro: Beretta 9) 
 Car 36, 36, we got a situation in progress 
 37 between 106th 
 We got a possible homicide 
 All cars, all cars, we got a situation down 
 (RZA) 
 Aiyo, toxi' off the grey goose, vodka, shots of hypnotic 
 Y'all bitches want beef, son, you got it 
 Fresh off the bliz-knock, Bob Diz-noc 
 Plex on the K.B., son, you get shiz-not 
 Right in your hiz-ead, you'll be diz-ed 
 Don't front on this nigga, I'mma from New York Ci-zey! 
 Y'all butter pec', make my nuts weak 
 Have me walk around, talkin' backward with stutter speak 
 Like tuh tuh tuh tuh tuh, buh buh buh buh 
 Butter pec', make my nutter weak 
 And y'all crabs down south, you ain't got a clue 
 How it feel to slip in that papi chino power u 
 White Cadillac truck just high beamed us 
 Mami look like she was Angie Martinez 
 I don't espanol, I play imposter 
 I was like "Mamacita, yah yah, que pasa?" 
 And slip back to my casa 
 She was like "Nigga! You sound like rasta!" 
 I'm the ace in the decks... 
 (Girl speaking Spanish) 
 (RZA) 
 I'm the ace in the deck, still casin' a Tec 
 That filled with the taste of the lead, buck buck 
 The bass and the treb', the space in the back 
 Where chumps walk by, and they face get slapped 
 I'm not known to talk a lot 
 Sit on five whips, son, so I don't walk a lot 
 Got ten chicks, so I don't hawk a lot 
 Been around the world, but I love New York a lot 
 Especially up in Bedstuy, with those crazy Cuffies 
 Or in Fort Green, with those crazy Cuffies 
 Y'all floss like y'all Jay-Z and Puffy's 
 You get robbed, bucked down by a crazy Cuffie 
 Bobby! Fuckin' the mics is my hobby 
 Fuckin' the mics is my hobby 
 (Outro: girl) 
 Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby 
 (Car smashing and glass shattering)
