Your love so Digi, ah 
 You make me dizzy, ah 
 Your love so Digi, ah 
 Yo, heart poundin?, chart bounded 
 God astounded, well rounded 
 Lost and founded, stay surrounded 
 By these hoes who can't count it 
 Park the whip then dismount it 
 Forty ounce, yeah I down 'em 
 Shorties drowns in pools of love 
 With these ounces I be loungin? 
 Roof thugs chew on slugs 
 Maneuver through hoods and clubs 
 Purple kush by the bush 
 Dick is curved like Nike swoosh 
 Push, push in this bush 
 Guaranteed to make her shush 
 Red bone, head on tilt 
 Six hundred cell phone bill 
 Big trucks, shell toe wheels 
 Velcro's loose, hell hold feels 
 Sell no pills, sell no deals 
 Niggas' styles, just no frills 
 You best to chill, nigga 
 Nigga, yeah, you best to chill 
 Yo, women I love 'em, leave 'em 
 Lust 'em but I don't trust 'em 
 The reason most men be buggin? 
 My lovin' Digi, you heard me? 
 My finger fuck 'em 
 They sell me off in return 
 Women I love 'em 
 They love me back in return 
 I'm just a young man 
 Head smart, cock strong 
 Got my swag on 
 Throw a mean dart, fuck it, we on 
 And got this fly talk 
 I kick that ass to the curb 
 You on the sidewalk 
 You gon' respect the Don's words 
 Your love so Digi, ah 
 You make me dizzy, ah 
 Hypnotized by her hips and thighs 
 Beastin? on the bitch, I ain't gon' lie 
 The H E Double N E, Double S Y 
 Got me in the vibe, her ass is super sized 
 I can see the future up in her eyes 
 We'll be dumb high, keep her occupied 
 Till the sunrise, I beat it up right 
 Then she can't deny she heard the roosters cry 
 Break her ass down with some crucial lines 
 Nasty darts known to seduce the mind 
 She all up in my world, she ain't even my girl 
 But she knowin' my world produce dollar signs 
 Whispered in my ear she'll swallow mine 
 Like she don't do this freaky type of shit all the time 
 Like she was the one or her head was that bum 
 I be dumb, sprung and just call her mine 
 Your love so Digi, ah 
 You make me dizzy, ah 
 Your love so Digi, ah 
 Ah, ah, ah, ah
