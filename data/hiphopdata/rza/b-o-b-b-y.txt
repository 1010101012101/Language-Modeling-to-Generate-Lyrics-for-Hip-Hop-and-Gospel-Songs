 Yo, you know us to be robust, the greatest crew since Cold Crush 
 This poisonous slang keep MC's avoidin us 
 Can't think about the proper remedies for destroyin us 
 Your best bet black is sit back and start enjoyin us 
 And run your commisary, attack your corinary, I'ma bury revolutionary 
 Honorary is sonic electronic brain like Johnny Nneumonic 
 Get boosted from the sorrow and went Wu-tonic 
 You be fickle, get your tongue thrown into a jar of pickle 
 To serve to your bird, with cheese and pumpernickle *Ch-cha Pssh* 
 Three state Charlie a classic like Marley Marl 
 Tie your ass down and run you over with a trolley car 
 My nigga Kucky keep 'em Bucky like Dent 
 Intent, read the fine print -- it says 
 Do not enter, or cross the lines 
 You be tossed behind, and forced to submit to the rhyme

 Four-four in the holster strapped tight by the velcro 
 Steel padded vest on the chest armed right from the elbow 
 Pointed rings resemble Killa Bee stings 
 It's the mental of slingin swords, thing ? a buck brings 
 Rain, hail, snow and earthquakes, search your mental birthdate 
 50 straight push-ups keep the body in perfect shape 
 Just got hit on the hip by this bird talkin' bout 
 She got a blister on her lip 
 That comes from not garglin after suckin 
 I'm togglin the buttons on my cell-phone 
 Call my nigga, Tone the well known 
 Bubblegoose shredders made him thick as Carl Weathers 
 Solid chrome barettas nines stuffed inside the Wu leather 
 Hot shots melt through your pleather 
 Never ending story not from the land of Nether 
 We fight for our wives to the death like Mega Evers 
 Wu-Tang Clan Forever, all and together now

 Yo, up from the rugged grains of Shaolin soil 
 Ol' Earth kept a nigga spoilt 
 Though the reigns to my veins remain royal, burnin up 
 High speed dub, my CD spins like a hub-cap on a Ac' 
 Tre-pound snub rap we might joust 
 Fresh spring water from the ounce 
 Stalked like a tomahawk, Indian bitch, you get scalped 
 Like a ticket sold in Cleveland, you feel me in 
 And now I stream up your bone marrow 
 Wu-Tang song last long as Christmas carols 
 Niggaz throw darts, I'm shootin flamin arrows 
 Pierce through your physical faculties 
 With pin-point accuracy 
 You don't wanna battle me...
