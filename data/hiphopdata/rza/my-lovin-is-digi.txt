 As 
 Bobby 
 Digital 
 In 
 Stereo (rza) protect your girl from bobby digital 
 Sometimes! I find! (force md's) 
 Someone, fuckin' with my pussy 
 My money and my ride 
 Tuck my nine inside my hoody (repeat 3x) 
 Sometimes! I find! 
 Chorus: ms. roxy 
 Catch me if you can bumpin 
 Rides laced in a van - nothin' 
 Ride shotgun and, bobby keep the love comin' 
 Compares when my niggaz come in I'm sittin' pretty and my lovin' is digi (bobby digital) 
 Fresh dipped out my laboratory, just dropped down bout 40 stories 
 Red and blue mismatched shoe, abandoned your wu-wear bandana 
 Hit the ground, you analog cats ain't got nothin' for me 
 Play you vegas type hoes silly, like dantana 
 Bubble hill banger goose, gold rope thick as hangman noose 
 She had the honey blonde hair mixed, with the chocolate mousse 
 Butterfly tattoo, boo, let me holla at you 
 New york city ditty bop type slang, girl let's smoke a blantz 
 And I'll change that tattoo to a wu-tang tattoo 
 Hit the jack danz, and after that we could dance 
 With the black widow, gold benz with the chrome griddle 
 Fat juicy lips, ebony let me taste your spittle 
 Chorus (except last line) (bobby digital) 
 Hear rap like angela bassett for malcolm x 
 And one inside her power-u she said she use for nuttin 
 Ice cold golden texts, cassette of inspectah deck 
 Uncontrolled substance, earring inside her belly button 
 Scream on it, bobby the black green hornet 
 Girl dream on it, I put the killa bee sting on it 
 Rejuvenated, honey kept her throat lubricated 
 Let off so much chi, ginseng couldn't recuperate it 
 Quentin tarantino type porn, like lewinsky-bill clinton 
 Suck it down with no commercial, 
 Back scratchin, eyes squintin, dusk to dawn 
 Good power universal self savior why 
 B.o.b.b.y.! 
 C'mon dream on it, the killa bee sting on it (bobby digital) 
 Girl scream on it, bobby the black green hornet 
 Screw the top off the boilin pot, girl you must be boilin hot 
 Sit on my unfalling cock, let me strike your g spot 
 Chorus (bobby digital) 
 Yo, kept a nigga well fed, put seven braids in my head 
 Pillow soft as cobweb, egyptian cotton bedspread 
 Lyin' deep between the legs, I mix the sperm with the eggs 
 Bust off about a keg, she called it creamy nutmeg 
 Chorus (bobby digital) 
 Throw on my high beams, her breasts was like two scoops of ice cream I scream, you scream, we all want, ice cream 
 Bone until she fall asleep, she can have a nice dream I scream, you scream, we all want the ice cream 
 Chorus + "and my lovin' is digi... 
 And my lovin' is digi... 
 And my lovin', and my lovin' 
 And my lovin' is digi" 
 Down-town!
