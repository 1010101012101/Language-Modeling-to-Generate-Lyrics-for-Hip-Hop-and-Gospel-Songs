(Prince Rakeem and Girl Talking) 
 Yes 
 Sexy Stuff 
 Oh Yeah! 
 Definitely 
 Oh Yeah 
 Rakeem: I got too many ladies, I got to learn to say no 
 Woman: Oh, We Love You Rakeem 
 Rakeem: I got too many ladies, yo, I got to learn to say no 
 Woman: Oh, We Love You Rakeem, Oh Rakeem 
 Time is moving slow, life is a drag 
 This money to make ya, more girls to bag 
 Fully aware, so I step upon the square 
 Lookin' for what? The cooty and the chair 
 Flex and I flex on the opposite sex 
 Hit 'em off quick and step to the next 
 It's seems I'm a feem for a sex routine 
 Love to hear them scream 
 (Woman: Oh Rakeem) 
 And my response is "Oh" 
 Always satisfy them, you know how I flow 
 But since I'm not lazy, I'm buck wild and crazy 
 I kiss the bussom, but never eat the daisies 
 And my ladies love me deeply 
 Because I'm handsome, charming and freaky 
 And when they need me, they won't go 
 And now I'm stuck, I should of said no 
 Woman: Oh we love you Rakeem 
 Rakeem: And I love you to 
 Woman: Oh we love you Rakeem 
 Rakeem: Thank you 
 Woman: Oh we love you Rakeem 
 Rakeem: Your far too kind 
 Woman: Oh Rakeem 
 Rakeem: Gosh 
 Woman: Oh we love you Rakeem 
 Rakeem: You feeling mutual love 
 Woman: Oh we love you Rakeem 
 Rakeem: Oh do you? 
 Woman: Oh we love you Rakeem 
 Rakeem: Hmmmmm 
 Woman: Oh Rakeem 
 When I walk down the block 
 The girls stop and glock 
 They hop on my jock 
 'Cause I got mad props 
 Tall and slim with the brown skin conflection 
 Half them sweating my love and affection 
 As I collect them, I must wan't to protect them 
 Love them deeply, but never disrespect them 
 I keep a tab on the large amount 
 But sometimes I find myself losing count 
 Of Latika, Diane, Lisa 
 Stephanie, Jackie, Teresa 
 Sharonda, um um, Veronica 
 Latasha, Sinthia and Monica 
 Never the less, you must give respect 
 To the femine queens that the God selects 
 I love them all, but even though 
 I'm rather happy, I should of said no 
 But yet my ego gets in the way 
 And always something that I'll never say 
 I'd just bag them, keep 'em under my wing 
 Put them in a posse, and et them sing 
 Do you 
 Say it again baby 
 Yes I like it 
 Come on you can say it louder 
 'Cause I love you all 
 Thank you 
 Rakeem Allah the greatest baby
