(Intro: RZA/Bobby Digital) 
 Yo, yo, fuck what you think 
 Fuck what you think 
 (Chorus: RZA/Bobby Digital) 
 It's about what you know, so fuck what you think 
 Twenty-one and over to drink 
 Nineteen and over to fuck 
 Sixteen and over to pat 
 A twelve year old kid got bucked 
 (RZA/Bobby Digital) 
 This week inperium flat lay your ass flat as a matress 
 Smack your head off the axis, the rhyme fashous 
 Silencer on the tech-nine shot got your pillow wet 
 All your bitch say was the black silhouette 
 Of the dark ninja, Lion King of the jungle, Simba 
 Cut the roof to your family tree, timber 
 We and Dr. Strange in the black reign smokin' chimneys 
 Phat Cappadonna tape stuck inside my Benzi 
 The blue coats is comin', the red coats is comin' 
 The fed coats is comin', the wet heads is comin' 
 I heard to Dirt was up in the Riker's fuckin' a female 
 CO, Wu-Tang keep it on the D-low 
 Third eye is a trillion million watt gigabyte 
 Insite like bright, can't find this on your website 
 Everglow superior to your inferior material 
 Verbal serial murder, givin' you pussy cats material 
 Injections, lethal injections, ran from house 
 Left the dictionary, pictionary, the non-fictionary 
 Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, puzzle like jigsaw 
 Suggled author BizMark, yo 
 (Islord) 
 Aiyyo, rock head niggaz who grab mics for the first time 
 Get fronted on majory once the God slides in 
 On the scene, love-love in the place to be 
 All-American lyrics, the top choice 
 In this rap market from Now Y all the way to England 
 'Cause my click be jinglin under Wu-Tang Productions 
 This crook that sell a million, then bounced on outta state 
 Rap fiends was trapped in cells like hot cakes 
 Faster than the rate of the Earth travel 
 Which one-hundred-thirty-seven and one third miles per a hour 
 And peace to the God Power for never fallin' for nothin' less 
 Than a hundred grands and rap with rubberbands placed in 
 Golden suitcases, slitted across the table 
 To walk the dogs in the nine-eight, the nine-eight 
 (9th Prince/Madman) 
 Yo, I build with the great minds of Africa 
 RZA, Star Trek Voyager, Killah Hill side strangler 
 Captured you in inside thirty-six gas chambers 
 North American, Arabian, high ? Indian 
 9th Prince convinces his enemies to kill themselves 
 Like Dr. Kavorkian, travel like razor satellites 
 Prepared for battle to rade the castle 
 Got tackled by the rebels, the plate in my head is heavy metal 
 Lyrical chain reaction, deadly instruments, run for Symantecs 
 The international civil war assassins 
 Geological, biochemical, camouflaged nuclear aropostles 
 Sounds posible, 'cause regardless visual 
 English grammar, mental examiner 
 I shock the world like the death of Princess Diana 
 Reverse psychology on technology, accept no apologies 
 The penalty is to cut off your arms and feet 
 Poetry teachers are speechers seepin through the speakers 
 My fans will become die hard listeners, plus ear bleeders 
 (RZA/Bobby Digital) 
 Fuck what you think 
 Fuck what you think 
 Fuck what you think 
 (Outro: RZA/Bobby Digital) 
 Word up, Fuck what you think 
 Word up, yo 
 *Beepin sound to fade*
