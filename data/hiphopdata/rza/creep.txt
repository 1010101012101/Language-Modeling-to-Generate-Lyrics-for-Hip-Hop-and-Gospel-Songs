Creep, creep, creep 
 Catch them while they're sleep 
 Empty every shell from your clip 
 Knock them off their feet 
 These streets that we maneuver through, ain't nothing you familiar to 
 Don't talk it out, noodle you, walk it out at your funeral 
 Cold blooded, black hearted, Black Knight and Black Ballin' 
 Black Christmas, be all in your crib with my killas callin? 
 Even if you ain't street then we creepin', it ain't no secret 
 Delete you with big toast, that roast you when it heat ya 
 Off whiskey, pop up and bong that ass like Bob Digi 
 Crisis the sharpshooter, I'ma lay 'em down gently 
 One shot, guns pop in the streets of Camelot 
 That's why some keep they shit off safety 
 Others keep they hammers cocked 
 Ready to blow, ready to go, fire in the hole 
 And if a nigga ready to retire, we retiring his soul 
 Creep, creep, creep 
 Catch them while they're sleep 
 Empty every shell from your clip 
 Knock them off their feet 
 Aiyo, I woke up hungry every day 
 Till I learn to do the hustle every which and every way 
 The Compton niggas hit the Chevy with the K 
 And the candy apple tray she gets heavy in L.A. 
 When Track died, Mack cried 
 Once we start banging again then he did a back slide 
 I was in tune with the sun, star, moon 
 Eddie shot up thirty niggas in the bar over June 
 The city's full of Crips 
 AK's, four-fives, mac-11's, full of clips, Long Beach 
 Young hogs wit they pockets full of chips 
 If any, not many, academic scholarships 
 Pulp Fiction, driving in your car without permission 
 With a video vixen, giving me head like Bill Clinton 
 Got a drug addiction, pop pills with no prescription 
 Stuck in the rehab, the only man with bad intentions 
 Truly I'm the one the West is really missing 
 Your shit is garbo', I kill you off with one sentence 
 The rap apprentice, with a little sack of new inventions 
 Don't listen and I Jimmy off your head like a henchman 
 Creep, creep, creep 
 Catch them while they're sleep 
 Empty every shell from your clip 
 Knock them off their feet 
 Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze 
 Make them Swiss cheese 
 Empty every shell from your clip 
 Knock them off their feet 
 You wanna feel the heat? I pull the flame out 
 Make a wish boy, blow your brains out 
 Watch me step out the cribby with the heavy chain out 
 Leaving blood on your shirt, you can't get the stain out 
 In a big body truck my hair knotty as a fuck 
 Shotty tucked under the seat plus a hottie in the truck 
 Get these wizes, get these digits, get my ninjas back in business 
 All you suckas get the scissors 
 You don't work like you broke and keep AK's like I'm Oakland 
 I be, making that dough, like the Pillsbury Doughman 
 Bobby, covered in ice like it's Frosty the Snowman 
 You suckas is useless like old New York tokens 
 Front on the Bobby D, watch how your body bleed 
 You ain't worth the weight of a grain from a poppy seed 
 Make your brain rupture, decompose your frame structure 
 MC's tremble when they hear the name of us 
 Puffin' Eastwood stogies, swinging Tiger Woods bogeys 
 The mic is my co-d, the pen is a parolee 
 No jail cell can hold me, Zodiac can't describe me 
 King Tech scratch the beat like he caught poison ivy 
 Compton's where you can find me in the hood, so grimy 
 Run laps on these tracks, it's a fact, you can time me 
 Ready, set, go, I let the, tech blow 
 Rugged Monk kill a track at any tempo 
 It's simple, we usually take all niggas garments 
 Spot rush them busters, blockade they apartment 
 It's over, foreclosure, your shit is shut down 
 Creep when you sleep and squeeze the four pound 
 Creep, creep, creep 
 Catch them while they're sleep 
 Empty every shell from your clip 
 Knock them off their feet 
 Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze 
 Make them Swiss cheese 
 Empty every shell from your clip 
 Knock them off their feet
