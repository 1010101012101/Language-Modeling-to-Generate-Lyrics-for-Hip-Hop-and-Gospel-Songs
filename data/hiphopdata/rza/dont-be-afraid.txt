Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 I've been blessed by the sin of cathedrals 
 I'm regal, royal, spoiled, I sleep with paralegals 
 And tongue kiss lawyers and cops 
 Buy a pound of chocolate off the block 
 Then I puff with the NARC's 
 My Clan's wild cannibal, Wu and my man'll shoot 
 Blaow, leave your cold grip as rare like the sandal shoe 
 From banana head chunks, propaganda pumps 
 Leave 'em buried on the Staten Island dump 
 Tap the mic on the floor, chains to the Mighty Thor 
 Two blades on my arm, look like the God of War 
 Ason in my heart, yeah, I like it raw 
 Words in the apple, I'ma bite it to the core 
 Digitech, used to call me Prince Dynamite 
 'Cause when I blew up the set you couldn't find a mic 
 Leave your ass in the dark, you can't find the light 
 You been wrong so long, you can't find the right 
 Way to speak, I spend a day on the beats 
 Then a day on the paper, then a date on the beach 
 Then a night in the sheets with fine wizzes 
 Dime wizzes who don't waste time they get straight down to business 
 Zig Zag, make your girl catch a whip lash 
 Tried to look when she seen the God zip past 
 Money stack high up like a skyscraper 
 Fly shorties getting stuck to my fly paper 
 Now we march to the monument 
 You see the seven in the star on the amulet? 
 Don't allow negative in my circumference 
 You can't understand, son, you incompetent 
 The P is free, would you fuck for a million bucks? 
 Keep the steel concealed in the wheeler trucks 
 Shakwan put the rhinestone on the rims 
 Timbo King put the rhinestones on his Timbs 
 We live this life each and every day 
 We all trying to make it a better way 
 If you miss the words that I say 
 Hit pause, record and hit play 
 I'm backed by a beautiful strong wiz 
 Bless all to the Earths and all the kids 
 Long live the god Divine and Big Free 
 Young seeds and great kings 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name 
 Don't be afraid to call my name
