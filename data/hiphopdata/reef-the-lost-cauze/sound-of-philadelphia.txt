Yeah 
 It's the sound of Philadelphia 
 Yo, yo 
 Welcome to the home of brotherly love 
 Brothers covered in blood 
 The man's office is covered in bugs 
 The youth dreams cut short, swept under the rug 
 Love for self is outweighed by the love for the drugs 
 Go Eagles, McNabb and T.O. 
 We ain't hard to find homey, just follow the weed smoke 
 We eat rolls of greased beef soaked, overweight and evil 
 A city of justice unequal 
 The shadow of New York we still under 
 So we gotta kill 'em every summer, walk a little tougher 
 Guns bustin' how we chose to fight 
 When you can go from bein' a star to a scumbag overnight 
 Streets often deserted on the coldest nights 
 All hair trigger thunderbirds show you're right 
 Cops don't ask if ya know your rights 
 Hopeless hypes smokin' pipes 
 Pavement gamblers rollin' dice 
 Short sentence describe your whole life 
 Low expectancy at a low price for a low life 
 The mind of many years shines, soul so bright 
 But they could give a fuck, in their crib no lights 
 Everybody rhyme and they claim they don't write--it down 
 Sit down, take it all in 
 Civilization, this is where it all ends 
 The city I call kin 
 Yo, so take caution 
 It's the sound of Philadelphia 
 Gun shots and pretty beats 
 Come along with me, hear my city speak 
 It's talkin' to ya, it's giving you a heads up 
 It's sayin' that niggaz 'round here is gettin' fed up 
 On stoops the fruits of my labor 
 Are made by moves that major 
 Hood gossip never news from the newspaper 
 Don't ask me for shit, we never do favors 
 The elders are now just a bunch of reclused neighbors 
 Tax dollars go to prisons, new judges, new chambers 
 Love it when you lose, kill ya if you came up 
 Niggaz passin' disease, fuckin' the same slut 
 You either cuttin' a demo or gettin' 'caine cut 
 Don't go to school, they'll treat you like a lame duck 
 You ain't my master, yeah it's a shame but 
 What do you expect from--kids who need respect 
 'Cause no one was at home for them to learn respect from? 
 We respect guns, we respect funds 
 Let's face it, my future don't look like the Jetsons 
 Don't ask the government for help 'cause we expect none 
 Our heroes get murdered and replaced with the next one 
 It's like a wild west done 
 On the way out I hope I get one 
 But I doubt that will happen 
 'Cause of crabs in a barrel 
 I'll probably end up in a cage 
 'Cause I had to let a blast from the barrel 
 The city of Philly {*echoes*} 
 It's the sound of Philadelphia 
 Gun shots and pretty beats 
 Come along with me, hear my city speak 
 It's talkin' to ya, it's giving you a heads up 
 It's sayin' that niggaz 'round here is gettin' fed up
