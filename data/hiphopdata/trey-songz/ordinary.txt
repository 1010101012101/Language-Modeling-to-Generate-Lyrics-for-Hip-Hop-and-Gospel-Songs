Don't you hate an ordinary nigga (I do) 
 Drinking on ordinary liquor (We don't) 
 Niggas spending ordinary money 
 We don't never fuck with basic bitches (that sound crazy) 
 Your bitch got on ordinary heels (but what you doing) 
 Can't tell you how ordinary feels 
 I pull up on any girl and she with it (she with it) 
 Imma hook her up with other bitches 
 I don't take em' to the crib 
 I take em' to hotel suites 
 Never know which room it is 
 I got about four damn keys 
 I'm used to that, she ain't used this 
 That's goofy shit, just order that 
 He ain't nothing like me, girl [?] like to me 
 He ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, whoa-ordinary 
 Ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, whoa-ordinary 
 Ordinary 
 Don't you hate an ordinary nigga (I do) 
 Drinking on ordinary liquor (Uh huh) (wassup) 
 Niggas spending ordinary money (No) 
 We don't never fuck with basic bitches (that sound crazy) 
 Bitch your shoe game and your bag game that ain't it 
 That ordinary and this fly shit you already know it don't mix 
 Said why you got two circles on your belt buckle 
 I said bitch 
 This Ferragamo, your swag broke, and this some shit you can't fix 
 What's on my feet, say it with me baby, Balenciaga 
 Ya your nigga on that basic shit Red Lobster 
 Ya he scooped ya up and he took ya out 
 Nigga had you sitting on cloth 
 Came through Rolls-Royce when I pick you up 
 Had you chillin' the back looking boss 
 You know I really got my money on my mind 
 So I'm really like fuck that bitch 
 Frank Mueller probably wonder what it cost 
 But man I'm like fuck that shit 
 Ten chaniz on that boosie shit 
 What you staring at that groupie shit 
 I'm used to this, she ain't used to that 
 [?] With that goofy shit wassup 
 I don't take em' to the crib 
 I take em' to hotel suites 
 Never know which room it is 
 I got about four damn keys 
 I'm used to that, she ain't used this 
 That's goofy shit, just order that 
 He ain't nothing like me, girl [?] like to me 
 He ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, whoa-ordinary 
 (Look at all these ordinary niggas) 
 Ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, ordinary, whoa-ordinary 
 Ordinary 
 Don't you hate an ordinary nigga (Oh Ya I do) 
 Drinking on ordinary liquor (Oh no we don't) 
 Niggas spending ordinary money (no) 
 We don't never fuck with basic bitches (that sound crazy)
