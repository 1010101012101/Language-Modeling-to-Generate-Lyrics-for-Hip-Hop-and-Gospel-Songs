You never know how things 
 Gone turn out huh? 
 I know you got the best love 
 That I ever had 
 I swear that when I look at you, 
 The time don't pass 
 Intoxicated without 
 A sip from a glass 
 Infatuation was real 
 Thought we would last 
 But you're gone away 
 Thought you were gonna stay 
 I got deceived again 
 I can't believe 
 And now you got someone who don't 
 Treat you right, treat you right 
 Treat you right, treat you right 
 Treat you right 
 You already know who use to 
 Treat you right, treat you right 
 Treat you right, treat you right 
 Treat you right 
 You look for me and you know I be 
 Out of sight, out of sight 
 Out of sight, out of sight 
 Out of sight 
 When you the one who told me to get 
 Out ya life, out ya life 
 Out ya life, out ya life 
 Out ya life 
 That's unfortunate 
 That's unfortunate 
 That you didn't believe in me 
 You know I got the best love 
 That you ever had 
 Tell me how it feels to know 
 You'll never get it back 
 Baby tell me how our train 
 Never got up off track 
 Never be the same 
 Thought our hearts were attached 
 But you're gone away 
 Thought you were gona stay 
 I got deceived again 
 I can't believe 
 And now you got someone who don't 
 Treat you right, treat you right (don't) 
 Treat you right, treat you right (don't) 
 Treat you right 
 You already know who use to 
 Treat you right, treat you right 
 Treat you right, treat you right 
 Treat you right (oh) 
 You look for me and you know I be 
 Out of sight, out of sight 
 Out of sight, out of sight 
 Out of sight (sight) 
 When you the one who told me to get 
 Out ya life, out ya life 
 Out ya life, out ya life 
 Out ya life (Oh) 
 That's unfortunate (Oh, oh) 
 That's unfortunate 
 That you didn't believe in me 
 It ain't gon last forever 
 I'm telling you 'cause I done been there 
 Heart turn to anger 
 Friends turn to strangers 
 But right now I don't care 
 And you'll get there 
 (You will, you will, you will) 
 You didn't keep 
 (So unfortunate!) 
 Your promise 
 And now you got someone who don't 
 Treat you right, treat you right 
 Treat you right, treat you right 
 Treat you right 
 You already know who use to 
 Treat you right, treat you right 
 Treat you right, treat you right 
 Treat you right 
 You look for me and you know I be 
 Out of sight, out of sight 
 Out of sight, out of sight 
 Out of sight (sorry) 
 When you the one who told me to get 
 Out ya life, out ya life 
 Out ya life, out ya life 
 Out ya life (oh) 
 That's unfortunate (that I) 
 That's unfortunate (la, la, la) 
 That you didn't believe in me 
 You never know how things
