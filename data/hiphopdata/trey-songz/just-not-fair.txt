They say follow a good woman, she'll never lead you astray 
 So to this day don't understand how yoo keep up with me, 
 'Cause I'm a bad boy, Sean Diddy Combs, 
 Every city, different biddy, that's the shit he on 
 And at the same time I'm very regretful, 
 'Cause it's the truth when I tell you that you're special, 
 Only one I wanna hold, when the night fall, 
 These other broads get night rod, give me face time, no iPhone or Skype call 
 I can't even breath, 
 'Cause You're my air, you're my air, 
 I can't sleep at night, I can't sleep, 
 Causeou're not, you're not here, 
 Don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna) 
 This I swear (but I gotta) 
 I still love you girl, 
 But it's just not fair to you, the things I put you through (yeah) 
 (Feel like the scum of the earth) 
 It's just not fair to you (I can't keep holdin' on) 
 You deserve better for you, yeah 
 Said it's just not fair. 
 If I should be lettin go 
 But how can I let you go girl, 
 When you're such a special girl, 
 And just like the Jerry Curl you're so glow, 
 Spirit of an angel, plus you be the realist shit, 
 When the water's rocky, you're the sail to my ship, 
 And the anchor, hold a nigga down everywhere you go, 
 Big booty cutie, you my type, no stereo 
 Fender broke, tinted no, you was still in it though 
 Angelic as dove, these other birds is chickens yo 
 Can we really call it immature? 
 From mature, not to tell you all I ever do is fail you, 
 Could never reassure you that you're different from others, 
 Even if my most special moments spent when you or my mother, 
 Only you can hear my deepest secrets, 
 Only you can have comfort me 
 But soon enough you say this nigga only disappointin' me 
 Guess I'm having fun, 
 But what good will the enjoyment be if I know you not there supportin' me 
 So I'mma let you go... stupidly 
 I can't even breath, 
 'Cause You're my air (air girl) 
 I can't sleep at night 
 'Cause you're not here, 
 Don't wanna let you go, 
 This I swear, but I gotta 
 'Cause I still love you girl, 
 But it's just not fair to you 
 The things I put you through (yeah) 
 It's just not fair to you 
 You deserve better for you, yeah 
 Said it's just not fair. 
 Girl if I can hold heart in my hands, I'd do it ever so gently 
 But I don't want the blood on my hand 
 Even though I know it's 'cause of me 
 That you cry alone, sleepness nights, deep inside 
 It hurts that I can't be the man you need me to 
 Still I know I need you, 
 I can't even breath, 'cause you're my air, 
 I can't sleep at night 
 'Cause you're not, you're not here, 
 Don't wanna let you go, this I swear, 
 'Cause I still love you girl, 
 But it's just not fair. 
 I can't even breath, you're my air 
 I can't sleep at night, I can't sleep at night, 
 'Cause you're not, you're not here, 
 Don't wanna let you go, this I swear, 
 I still love you girl, 
 But it's just not fair to you, 
 The things that I put you through, yeah, 
 It's just not fair.
