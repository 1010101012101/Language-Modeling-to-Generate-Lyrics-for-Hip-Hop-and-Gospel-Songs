Talking: 
 I'm a jusu get right to it 
 Singing: 
 Feelin' like a million 
 A trillion 
 Bills and um 
 Talking: 
 Na I'm a jues 
 Wait till it drop 
 Aight let's go (Yupp) 
 (Verse 1: Singin') 
 Feelin' like a million trillion bills an I'm revealin all dis jewelry 
 Chickens wanna cock a doodle me 
 Wouldn't that be cool to me 
 Let 'em think day schoolin me 
 They get no with argues an day brains like a tool to me 
 Yes I'm fresh um 
 Leanin 2 the left um 
 Liquor on ma breath 
 Bitches singin' 2 the left 2 the left 
 Do ya step do ya step 
 I'm drunk but I can drive ma self 
 (Verse 2: Fynch) 
 An I'm a VA nigga drankin all the bottles at the bar 
 You can tell I'm star 
 Shoulda saw me hoppin out the drop 
 26s my nigga 
 Ridin' high smokin' 
 My weed come in a jar 
 Keepin' it hood my nigga 
 Drankin ma lean out the bottle 
 Gotta have a pocket fulla money just to be at my car doe 
 An I ain't thankin' 'bout a hata cause the pump in the car doe 
 I'll leave you slump in ya car low 
 Throw them deuces my nigga 
 Day gon' have to catch me tomorrow 
 If I come an they follow

 4 5 on my side when they come with tha hollows 
 All the ladies they love me 
 They like the way I be leanin 
 Geeked up treed up an I'm Promethean 
 Money 
 Yes I'm fresh um 
 Leanin 2 the left um 
 Liquor on ma breath 
 Bitches singin' 2 the left 2 the left 
 Do ya step do ya step 
 I'm drunk but I can drive ma self
