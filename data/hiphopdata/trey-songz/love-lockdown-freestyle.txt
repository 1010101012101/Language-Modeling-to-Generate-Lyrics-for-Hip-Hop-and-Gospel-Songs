 Leaking on the streets leaking on the beats

 You be hating me 
 Either way it be you make cake for me (yep)

 Then I'll watch him ooze 
 Leaking on the streets (ooh) leaking on the beats 
 I be killing these 
 You be feeling me (or) 
 You be hating me 
 Either way it be 
 You make cake for me (yep) 
 Watch how great I be (yep)
