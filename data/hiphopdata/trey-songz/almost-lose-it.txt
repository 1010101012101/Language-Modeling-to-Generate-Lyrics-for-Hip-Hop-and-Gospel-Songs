The doors open and everybody turns around, 
 To see you walk down the aisle in your pretty white gown. 
 You're holding you daddy's arm, your tears begin to fall, 
 And both of our lives are about to change forever. 
 Everybody stands, she reaches out her hand the preacher says, 
 We're gathered here today and I... 
 I almost lose it, when I hear you say, "I do" 
 And I'm so in love with you, baby 
 I almost lose it, when I see that pretty face 
 It's more than I can take. 
 I wonder if she's nervous, or will she get cold feet. 
 She wears a smile, as the diamond shines from her wedding ring. 
 I hope it's everything you wanted, you deserve the best. 
 Always knew I'd be the reason, for your wedding dress. 
 So beautiful the way you read your vows, then the wedding bells ring, and I... 
 As the tears roll down your cheek, it's impossible for me to speak. 
 My heart is beating fast, and my knees are feeling weak. 
 So speak now or forever hold your peace. 
 Can't help but wonder from my seat if he know she was meant for me 
 I can't wonder from my seat if he knows... 
 Does he know you are meant for me, do you know? 
 Can't help but wonder... you know you're meant for me 
 And if you didn't know, you are... you are 
 I almost lose it...
