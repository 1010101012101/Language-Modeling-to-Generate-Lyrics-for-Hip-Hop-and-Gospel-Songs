My puerto rican mommy from miami tried to buy me 
 A teddy bear so I could sleep with something, 
 Wish she didn't sleep with something, 
 It could have been my baby from..., l.a., chicago, ... 
 And if you're in the sipping, let's get a bottle! 
 Nice, when I'm in vegas call my favorite waitress to get served. 
 She's rubbing all my muscles, trying to help me come on earth. 
 Baby slow it down, 'cause you're moving too fast! 
 I bought her two bags, trying to... 
 You want 'em shoes... 
 Daddy, can I get it? 
 You want that bag ...? 
 Daddy, can I get it? 
 You want 'em feel safe? 
 Daddy, can I whip it? 
 You want that car... 
 Daddy can I spend it, spend it, spend it! 
 Sex off the scale, neglect all detail, 
 Accept, you're... wet like... 
 Tell your girlfriend! she could stop the hating, 
 My assistant, ...like confirmation, 
 ...That I got you on your birthday, 
 Know the same game, even though I won't play! 
 I just got one way, you ain't getting home, 
 Girl, you know you wanna stay, you know my name. 
 Don't you know who is it? 
 I'm such a dog, won't you tell... 
 'Cause I chase that kitty cat girl... 
 Daddy's little girl, be sure I'll give you what you want!
