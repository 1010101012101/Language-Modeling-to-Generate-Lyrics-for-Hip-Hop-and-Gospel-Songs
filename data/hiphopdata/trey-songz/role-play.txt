Ay 
 I just got a idea. 
 You know, 
 Thinking of some things we could do. 
 Spice things up... 
 (Laughs) 
 Fa sho' 
 If I snuck up in yo bedroom, 
 Touch you while you sleep, 
 Would you act surprised as if you didn't know It's me? 
 I came to steal your heart girl don't call the police. 
 I only want a part girl, really just a piece. 
 You show me the money then I'm gon' show you the beast. 
 If you give me your honey, girl I promise I'll be sweet. 
 Then I'm gon' sneak out the back so nobody will notice me. 
 Then, we can run it back girl it's your turn to go wit me 
 We can... 
 We can try some role play, 
 You can do what I say, 
 I can do what you say. 
 You can have it your way.

 The rooms spinnin' ridiculous. 
 My body freezin' cold. 
 I can't even remember at we I did the night before. 
 I don't know where I am girl, but I gotta go. 
 I can't feel ma legs, somebody help. 
 If you come in and rescue me, 
 I don't know what to do. 
 I say I need a remedy, 
 You say the cure is you. 
 Then you tell me relax, 
 And get ready for surgery. 
 Baby fix me fast, 
 You know it's an emergency.
