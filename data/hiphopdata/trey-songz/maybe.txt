Maybe..(uh) Maybe..(uh) Maybe... Maybe be be be be be 'cause I put up a sun she never seen 
 Maybe cause my reality be stuntin on your dreams 
 Maybe but just maybe I'm exceptionally crazy 
 See I was born in the eighties I got a way with the ladies 
 I'm uh addicted to pimpin' maybe she thinks I'm different 
 Maybe I got what she want, maybe I got what she's missing 
 Maybe 'cause I'm her habit all she wanna do is kick it 
 And maybe 'cause I'm the tortus all you rabbits want a picture 
 Maybe life is a bore shorty wish it was a better 
 One night with your boss stay with your nigger forever 
 Got the game in the bag and they just wish they could grab it 
 Shout to you niggers hating like why is this nigger rapping? 
 Shout to the roumers and the dummies that condone it 
 Shouting to the people thinking I'm only here for the moment 
 Yeah I live in the moment but I'm so in the future 
 Maybe 'cause she wanna know what I'm about to do in the future 
 I said the future is like now, when the future's like wow, 
 How can I put it to you baby, you might just bow (bow down) 
 Respect is for your Highness I'm so forward they rewind it 
 Maybe you got bars but baby I'm off the wire 
 Maybe cause you thought I'd take it lighter 
 But the the fire still igniting 63 yeah bitch it's me and no extinguishers can try em 
 I say it they repeat it they recite it, 
 Way I'm spitting then you rap niggers supposed to be inspired 
 I tell you what's required to acquire your desires 
 So real I never get tired of some real good tires 
 'Cause I'ma roll this motherfucker to the wheel zone 
 And when they're gone, I'ma turn into a flintstone 
 Maybe it's my paper, maybe it's these haters 
 Maybe in miami or L.A. with the Lakers 
 Maybe 'cause I'm cold maybe I'm so cool 
 Maybe you're so old and maybe I'm so new 
 Maybe is my swagga or maybe it's my aura 
 Maybe cause her after was better than before us 
 Maybe 'cause I'm winning and you don't know what the score was 
 Maybe 'cause you're woman probably got it on my tour bus 
 Maybe 'cause you're lame and you know I be thugging it 
 Maybe 'cause it's you're dane and you know she be loving it 
 Maybe she off the chain and want it all in public 
 Maybe you be smugglin and I be on some other shit 
 Maybe I'm so special that she wish she never met you 
 And once I give her something to remember she'll forget you 
 Within a week of him delete you from BBM 
 You used to know you were special, but she never called and text you 
 Not a single voice mail but I know her voice well 
 And boy oh boy well was she going back to tell 
 That shit is off the scale, you can never ever weight it 
 We been going for some days shit I don't know what today is.
