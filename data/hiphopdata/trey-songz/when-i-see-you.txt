Listen mama when I said I was gone 
 You know I'll be back 
 It's been a while but you already know 
 Just make sure you have a little thing on me 
 'Cause baby oh 
 You know I didn't abandon your love, oh no 
 And lady, you know I never do that to us, 
 Notice that i, you the right you leave, you 
 You'll never be without me too long, 
 And when I'm gone I can't wait to get home to you 
 So girl you can be and you best believe I miss you 
 Like crazy get right here 'cause ... 
 Girl when I see you, I'm gonna hug you 
 Girl when I see you, I'm gonna touch you, 
 Girl when I see you, better I'm gonna love you, 
 Girl when I see you, better I'm gonna love you down. 
 Girl when I see you, I'm gonna kiss you, 
 Girl when I see you, because I miss you, 
 Girl when I see you, I'm gonna love you up, 
 Girl when I see you better I'm gonna love you down. 
 Girl I can't stop thinking about the way we do 
 What we do, it makes me smile 
 And honey you can't imagine how it feels 
 Missing the end in time, you r love it feels good. 
 You, I can't wait to see, 
 You'll never be without me too long, 
 When I'm gone I can't wait to get home to you 
 So girl you can be and you best believe I miss you 
 Like crazy get right here 'cause ... 
 Girl when I see you, I'm gonna hug you 
 Girl when I see you, I'm gonna touch you, 
 Girl when I see you, better I'm gonna love you, 
 Girl when I see you, better I'm gonna love you down. 
 Girl when I see you, I'm gonna kiss you, 
 Girl when I see you, because I miss you, 
 Girl when I see you, I'm gonna love you up, 
 Girl when I see you better I'm gonna love you down. 
 Once I give her ... 
 And you can't tell ... 
 .Go to explode when I see you 
 Yes the time is so right 
 Baby the time is tonight 
 Yes we need the time in your life.
