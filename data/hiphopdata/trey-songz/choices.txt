(Feat. sani g) 
 Hey look right, you got a few choices that need to be made shawty. 
 It's gonna be me and you, me and her, or... me, u and her. why not? 
 (Verse 1: trey songz) 
 I got one on my arm, and I was hopin that maybe just maybe, 
 U know, u can tag along 
 And I know I know it sound freaky and crazy, but that's how I get it on 
 Now I'm leavin' it up to u, but baby... don't you take to long 
 The game is over baby girl the choice is all on u 
 (Chorus: trey songz) 
 Life is wat you make it 
 U ain't gon get that chance unless you take it 
 If you gon come hard, come girl you can't fake it 
 I could roll wit her, I could rol wit u, wat you wanna do? 
 The game is over baby now the choice is up to u 
 (Verse 2: trey songz) 
 Shawty let me know, 'cause I love ya 
 See I could let you go, or I could cuff ya 
 It makes no difference to me, but I'd rather it be you baby 
 Long as you don't play the game 
 But game is over and the choice is up to u 
 (Chorus: trey songz) 
 Life is wat you make it 
 Ain't gon get that chance unless you take it 
 If you gon come hard, come real and you can't fake it 
 I could roll wit her, I could roll wit u, wat you wanna do? 
 The game is over baby now the choice is up to u 
 (Bridge: trey songz) 
 'Cause you are the one I want, but she is all I need 
 U both could give good love, and that means so much to me 
 And I'd like to have the two, but I know I'd have to choose, 
 So you gon have to choose too 
 Help me decide its u 
 (Chorus: trey songz) 
 Life is wat you make it 
 U ain't gon get that chance unless you take it 
 If you gon come hard, come girl you can't fake it 
 I could roll wit her, I could roll wit u, wat you wanna do? 
 Game is over baby now the choice is up to u 
 (Verse 3: sani g) 
 I'm a hood-like veteran, a four star general 
 Respected, selected, to stand on the pennicle 
 The crown on my head, at the top of the world, 
 Doin' a hundred, getin blunted in the drop wit the girls 
 Francised in my world, see bannana bezzles 
 Ol school like every nevel, this is king-pin level 
 They love me 'cause I'm real, know they got no actor 
 Break they backs every time, like chiroprator 
 Let me show you the way, enjoy a conversion 
 While we lay on the persian, yo juices surging 
 My good friends talk about it, they say three a party 
 Its, betta when you got four hands on ya body 
 Its extra large magnums, every time I strap up 
 One take a nigga down, the other get it back up 
 Don't knock it till you try it, lay next to me 
 Sex wit her and me, is like exctasy 
 (Chorus: trey songz) 
 Life is wat you make it 
 U ain't gon get that chance unless you take it 
 If you gon come hard, come real and you can't fake it 
 I could roll wit her, I could roll wit u, wat you wanna do? 
 Game is over baby now the choice is up to u 
 ...To u 
 The choice is up to u
