You know you dead wrong 
 Up in the club, but you left your man home 
 You couldn't even wait till we got to the bedroom

 You know you dead wrong 
 Up in the club, but you left your man home 
 You couldn't even wait till we got to the bedroom 
 I know it ain't good, but these hoes gon' do what they want, want

 But I let her chupa on mis huevos 
 We be fucking all the time but she know I'll never wife her, nah 
 Had her in a feeling when she see me with my white girl, ah 
 She act square around a nigga but when she with me she like girls, ah

 You know you dead wrong 
 Up in the club, but you left your man home 
 You couldn't even wait till we got to the bedroom

 You know you dead wrong 
 Up in the club, but you left your man home 
 You couldn't even wait till we got to the bedroom 
 I know it ain't good, but these hoes gon' do what they want, want 
 You know you dead wrong
