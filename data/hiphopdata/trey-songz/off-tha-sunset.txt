Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, SONGZ! 
 Lift up the bags, grab all my jewlery 
 I'm outta here soon as these shoes get on my feet 
 Can't you see, you don't touch me like you used to [no] 
 So I don't touch you like I used to 
 I used to moan your name, yup, so now my eyes be walkin' right away from ya 
 Just wanna let you know I'm leaving town 
 I'm out that door and I won't be around 
 No more sexen ya, No more kissin' ya, No more just when you're about to go 
 It's no more, woulda, coulda, shoulda 
 Didn't but you can't, 'cause I'm gone, gone, gone 
 Pack my clothes, I'm out that door 
 Won't see me no more 
 I ain't coming back I ain't runnin' back 
 Ooh, ooh off into the sunset I go [x4] 
 I wanna see you like I used to (yup!) 
 But I don't see you like I used to (no) 
 We used to be so tight 
 But the strings that attach just don't hold 
 Just so you know I'm leavin' town 
 I'm out that door and I won't be around no more
