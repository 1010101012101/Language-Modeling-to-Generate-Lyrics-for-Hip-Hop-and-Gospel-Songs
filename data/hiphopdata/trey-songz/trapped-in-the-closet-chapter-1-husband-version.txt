Its 5 o'clock and the sun wakes me 
 Up 
 Layin in with a girl that don't belong to me 
 For your respect darling lats g round two 
 And the she go starts kissin' me th sun rises then I move 
 Now she got ts dumbest look on ha face like wut have she done 
 How could she be so stupid to think she was the one 
 Must've lost the track of time 
 Man this girl was fine 
 From the club went from ha home 
 She didn't want to be alone 
 Here I am trickin while ma girl lays at home 
 Gotta fine my car keys so I can get up out the door 
 She stood there and wonderin 
 She aid don't leave that way 
 Looked at me like I was crazy 
 And I got up and walked away 
 Man I got a wife at home 
 And she said 
 Ooh I'm scared 
 And now I'm on ma way home 
 After someone was here 
 Shush shush quiet 
 I'm nervous as hell while I'm drivin' 
 Can't make a sound 
 'Cause I know I'm goin' down 
 What ima say when she ask me where I been 
 Ima say I fell asleep and was smokin' too much dough 
 Think... think 
 Shit she on know I'm lyin' 
 So I cop me some febreeze and sprayed around 
 Then I walked ma crazy ass up in the house 
 And I walked in and yelled I'm home 
 She said honey I'm in the room 
 I walkd in there with a smile on ma face 
 And said honey I been missin' you 
 She hopped all ova me and said she cooked and ran ma bath water 
 I'm tellin' ya now I ain't smell no food 
 She deserves an oscar 
 I threw in the bed and started to scratch ha clothes off 
 Thinkin' to ma self trey songz you "g" you puled it off 
 You ain't gon believe it but things get more crazy as the story goes on 
 We touchin, kissin' and listen 
 That it's not her phone 
 Should've seen the look I had on ma face 
 She tried to hold me back 
 But she knew it was too late 
 I hopped off and said there's a mystery and 'm goin' to solve it 
 And I'm like god please let no man be up in ma closet 
 I walk in the bathroom 
 Look behind the door 
 She said baby come back to bed 
 And I said bitch say no more 
 I pulled back the curtains and she's biting her nails 
 Then I walk back to the room 
 Now I'm sweatin like hell 
 I check unda the bed 
 Then unda the dresser 
 I look at the closet 
 Get ma gat out the dresser 
 I look back at the closet 
 Get closer to the closet 
 Now I'm at the closet 
 Now I'm openin the closet[ehoes]
