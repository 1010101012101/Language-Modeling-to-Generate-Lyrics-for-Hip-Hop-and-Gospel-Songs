Trey Songz: 
 It's just entertainment! 
 I'm not saying this to blame you I'm saying 
 I'm not saying this to play you I'm saying 
 It's all good when we making love 
 All I ask is don't take our love for granted 
 It's granted My love for you is real 
 If you don't love me somebody else will 
 Baby girl don't you ever oh no get too 
 Get to comfortable 
 Now ain't the bed comfy when you sleep 
 Don't your ass stay here for the free 
 It's the year of the G tho 
 You know how I be tho 
 Kick your ass out 
 And then I'm foul like a free throw 
 Call me crazy like Cee-Lo 
 4-5-6 chicks waiting like ceelo 
 Listening to them hoes 
 Get the boot like Timbo 
 Be missing the green 
 Like a fein for the indo 
 Don't act all low like limbo 
 My pie your slice like kimbo 
 Leave me and you dumb 
 Then slow 
 Gimme back my shit like a rental 
 Get out my face like a hair that's ingrown 
 Lotta brains never took you for a bimbo 
 A lotta lames you was rolling with a pimp tho 
 And I let you ride like I ride instrumentals 
 So you was saying you gonna leave me 
 Well take your time be easy 
 Cause girl you could never play me 
 Even if you listening to a Trey Day CD 
 Before I eject your disc 
 Let me know you this 
 I'm a family guy truly 
 But I could give a fuck about the dog or Stewie 
 I'm not saying this to make you upset 
 I'm not saying this to play you I'm saying 
 It's all good wanna break it off 
 All I ask when I'm taking off 
 That you handle it 
 Can you handle it 
 I don't need you for real 
 And though I loved you 
 Somebody else will 
 Cause you mustve got to comfortable 
 Peez: 
 First of all I wanna thank you 'cause I loved you 
 And the time we spent together you was downer than a sub you 
 Spoke ya mind and I liked that 
 Said what you said but didn't fight facts 
 And then I got my sight back 
 I held you up like a bike rack 
 Trust, love, security 
 In a man nowadays you liked that 
 But you took my kindness for weakness 
 I'm gone like the seasons 
 I'm cool and you freezin 
 You blew and I'm breezin 
 Cruisin and creepin' 
 Snoozin and losing on the best thing believe it 
 You got lazy like a rain day 
 But you my queen 
 I still got you like a checkmate always 
 It wasn't that we fell out that's the issue 
 It was just where we were in the situ (ation) 
 I can't deny you got the prettiest smile 
 And the way we worked 
 I wouldn't find another for a while 
 The way you licked 
 Them lips and them hips 
 Would say nigga 
 "I know you gon' miss this" 
 But girl we in the same boat 
 Jump out, and we both float 
 The sea come, and fish go 
 I see you clear like in slow-mo 
 We can be friends for the time 
 'Cause we ain't foes- trust 
 Just kick your feet up 
 We'll make a toast to the new us 
 Ice cubes a few cups 
 Baby it's cool 
 You was just 
 A little bit outta line 
 Come on home now 
 Home now 
 Come on home now 
 On Home 
 Come on home now 
 Come on home 
 Come on home now
