No Clothes On 
 We Back, hey 
 Songz 
 (Let me hear you say) 
 No Clothes On 
 (It's song book baby) 
 I can picture you with no clothes on 
 Girl I gotta have it 
 I'm attracted the way you dancin 
 Lookin' back at it 
 No clothes on 
 Everybody in and I wouldn't mind seein you 
 Snappin out them jeans 
 While you got no clothes on 
 And I'm so gone 
 Up in my zone 
 Baby, wut the bizness 
 (You're so grown) 
 Baby oh my goodness 
 Is this my imagination 
 Am I hallusinatin' gurl 
 (You're so grown) 
 And I just wanna be bad 
 Let me see your secrets 
 Wanna whisper in your ear 
 (Come here) 
 Lemme work that thang, 
 Lemme twerk that thang, 
 Lemme work that thang, 
 Lemme twerk that thang, 
 Gurl I might hurt that thang 
 Shawty what your name is 
 Ooh gurl, I gotta know 
 And shawty who you came wit 
 Don't take this personal 
 But I can picture you with no clothes on 
 Girl I gotta have it 
 I'm attracted the way you dancin 
 Lookin' back at it 
 No clothes on 
 Everybody in and I wouldn't mind seein you 
 Snappin out them jeans 
 While you got no clothes on 
 Ain't no more drone 
 If this your song 
 Why don't you go over there and do your thang 
 (Don't be shame) 
 But that booty body, 
 You a shawty 
 You been naughty 
 Hippin and touchin, the afterparty 
 (What's so wrong) 
 I just wanna make this clear 
 Can I whisper in your ear 
 Lemme work that thang, 
 Lemme twerk that thang, 
 Lemme work that thang, 
 Lemme twerk that thang, 
 Gurl I might hurt that thang 
 Shawty what your name is 
 Ooh gurl, I gotta know 
 And shawty who you came wit 
 Don't take this personal 
 But I can picture you with no clothes on 
 Girl I gotta have it 
 I'm attracted the way you dancin 
 Lookin' back at it 
 No clothes on 
 Everybody in and I wouldn't mind seein you 
 Snappin out them jeans 
 While you got no clothes on 
 No clothes 
 No clothes 
 No clothes 
 (You like the way I'm rockin' my hips) 
 When you're rockin' yo hips 
 Pop lock and drop it (Pop lock and drop it) 
 (Pop lock and drop it) 
 Ooh I love how you be leanin (Yeah I'm leanin) 
 Ah shawty, am I dreamin'? (You ain't dreamin') 
 I'm tryna say 
 Is gurl I'm seein you 
 Seein you 
 Seein you 
 With no clothes 
 (No clothes on) 
 No clothes 
 (No clothes on) 
 Ooh baby 
 But I can picture you with no clothes on 
 Girl I gotta have it 
 I'm attracted the way you dancin 
 Lookin' back at it 
 No clothes on 
 Everybody in and I wouldn't mind seein you 
 Snappin out them jeans 
 While you got no clothes on
