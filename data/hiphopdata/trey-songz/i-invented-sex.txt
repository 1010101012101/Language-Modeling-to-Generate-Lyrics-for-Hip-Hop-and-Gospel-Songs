(Intro: Trey Songs) 
 This goes out to the beautiful girls 
 Which one of y'all, which one of y'all 
 Which one of y'all goin' home wit trigga 
 (Verse 1: Trey Songz) 
 Sittin' at the club ooh shawty 
 Walkin' past a nigga lookin' at me all naughty 
 Then I sad baby wassup 
 Reach for the hand shake got a hug 
 Bottles of H got me wit a lil buzz 
 Up in VIP wit all of my thug niggas 
 You leaned over and said you want me 
 Girl, when the vallet pull the Benz up 
 Off to the crib shawty where we gon end up 
 Girl sit back relax hold up 
 Let me turn the radio on 
 (Chorus: Trey Songz) 
 Girl let me get you to the crib (let me get you to the crib) 
 Upstairs to the bed (upstairs to the bed) 
 Girl you gonna think (x4) 
 Girl when I pull back them sheets 
 And you climb on top of me 
 Girl you gonna think (x4) 
 You gonna think I invented sex (x3) 
 (Verse 2: Trey Songz) 
 Put the code in the gate 
 Pull up to the driveway 
 Said she like the way I touch her 
 Listenin to usher I got a confession 
 Know we bout to sin but your body is a blessing (Papa forgive me) 
 Girl can we take it up stairs 
 My bed's waiting there 
 All I want to do is 
 Give you all of me 
 Won't you give me all of you 
 I want your body like right now (right now) 
 You know I live a magnum lifestyle (lifestyle) 
 Baby turn the lights down 
 And ima turn you on 
 (Chorus: Trey Songz) 
 Girl let me get you to the crib (let me get you to the crib) 
 Upstairs to the bed (upstairs to the bed) 
 Girl you gonna think (x4) 
 Girl when I pull back them sheets 
 And you climb on top of me 
 Girl you gonna think (x4) 
 You gonna think I invented sex (x2) 
 'Cause I'm gonna do it like I did 
 (Verse 3: Drake) 
 It's a celebration clap clap bravo 
 Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscado 
 For the girl whos a student and the friend whos a model 
 Finish the whole bottle and we gon do it big like this 
 Yeah and he was just practice 
 He ain't in your world you can take him off your atlas 
 Girl you on fire can I be the one you match with 
 Ill give you the credit card and baby you can max this out 
 Show me where your tats is 
 Show me where you heads at 
 Maybe I can grasps it 
 If you ever come up wit a question you should ask it 
 Caught up on your ex still I can get you past it 
 Yeah and your friends all suggest 
 What's the chance of this nigga being betta than the rest 
 Just tell 'em you appreciate the help 
 But you just got to know for yourself 
 (Chorus: Trey Songz) 
 Girl let me get you to the crib (let me get you to the crib) 
 Upstairs to the bed (upstairs to the bed) 
 Girl you gonna think (x4) 
 Girl when I pull back them sheets 
 And you climb on top of me 
 Girl you gonna think (x4) 
 You gonna think I invented sex (x3)
