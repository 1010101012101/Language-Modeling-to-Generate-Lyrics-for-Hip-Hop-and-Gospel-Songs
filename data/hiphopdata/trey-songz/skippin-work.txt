Hop up in this bed baby 
 Let me run my fingers through your hair baby 
 I wanna drive you crazy 
 You be the mashed potatoes I'm the gravy 
 And you be moanin' beggin' mo' 
 I'll give you what you need 
 Grabbin' scratchin' turning backwards 
 Messing up the sheets 
 All I wanna do is lay up in this bed wit chu 
 Won't ever wanna leave this bedroom 
 We gon' be skippin' work 
 I'ma take the day off 
 'Cause I wanna spend it wit chu 
 We gon' be skippin' work 
 All the phones turned off 
 Ain't nobody get through 
 We gon' be skippin' work 
 Skippin' work girl 
 I'ma touch your body baby 
 I'ma kiss your body baby 
 I'm gon' put in some work 
 And girl I promise tonight 
 I'm gon' get me some overtime 
 I wanna lay wit chu 
 And make your body scream 
 Yodel-ay-he-hoo 
 Girl I promise I won't do your body wrong 
 Just remove that thong 
 And you know it's on 
 We can sip some wine nd watch some TV 
 We don't go nowhere 
 And girl I love your body 
 You don't need no underwear 
 So excuse me for being so freaky 
 Excuse me for being so downright nasty 
 We gon' be skippin' work 
 I'ma take the day off 
 'Cause I wanna spend it wit chu 
 We gon' be skippin' work 
 All the phones turned off 
 Ain't nobody get through 
 We gon' be skippin' work 
 Skippin' work girl 
 I'ma touch your body baby 
 I'ma kiss your body baby 
 I'm gon' put in some work 
 And girl I promise tonight 
 I'm gon' get me some overtime 
 Hop up in this bed 
 Girl take it off 
 When you see this bed girl 
 Take it off take it off 
 I promise to give 
 Your body some good loving 
 And baby you and me 
 We gon' be skippin' work 
 I'ma take the day off 
 'Cause I wanna spend it wit chu 
 We gon' be skippin' work 
 All the phones turned off 
 Ain't nobody get through 
 We gon' be skippin' work 
 Skippin' work girl 
 I'ma touch your body baby 
 I'ma kiss your body baby 
 I'm gon' put in some work 
 And girl I promise tonight 
 I'm gon' get me some overtime
