(Check it uh Songz 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 What up Jasmine baby 
 This should get to your ears 
 Wanna let you know your albums great 
 You my new favorite baby) 
 She bust the windows out my car 
 My black mercedes 22 inch rims 
 I know it's probably 'cause I broke her heart 
 But right now I don't care about that part 
 She bust the windows out my car 
 Couldn't believe it when I saw my ride 
 That very moment then I knew it was her 
 Can't even trip because I knew I deserve 
 I must admit it hurt a little bit 
 Thinking how could I lead her to do this 
 I never thought that she had so much strength 
 But she's gonna see what happens when 
 You throw a brick into a players whip 
 It's goin' violent, it's so childish 
 You'll probably say that it was worth your while 
 Well I hope you had a chance to smile 
 She bust the windows out my car 
 My black mercedes 22 inch rims 
 Wrote her initials with a black crowbar 
 And when I find her I will know where to start 
 She bust the windows out my car 
 And man I was lucky that was all she did 
 I gotta fix this, man this some bullshit 
 She bust my windows out my car, went too far 
 Just cause the love thing we call ours 
 Fell apart 
 But she had to fuck up my car 
 But I ain't no pussy, I ain't goin' trip 
 Spend a couple dollars, 
 I'ma fix my shit 
 Girl you know that you then f***ed now 
 You threw a brick into a players whip 
 It's goin' get violent, 'cause it's so childish 
 She'll probably say that it was worth her while 
 Mad as I am all I can do is smile 
 She bust my windows, My black mercedes 
 I know it's probably 'cause I broke her heart 
 I must admit I care about that part 
 Relationship messer upper, plus a window buster, baby we made for eachother 
 Ain't nothin' better than, your loving and come back 
 I need you bad like Jasmine Sullivan 
 I'm a puff till the endo gone 
 Ridin' in the whip with the windows gone 
 I can see you gettin' your tip toe on 
 Quick, throw the brick, and dip she's gone 
 Off in the night, all cause of my lies 
 Why, I can't get it right 
 I ride through the city lights 
 With my hat bent, behind what used to be called black tents 
 I don't know y'all, wrote her initials with a crowbar 
 That means shorty go hard 
 It was just a one night creep off 
 I ain't even take me sneaks off, I swear
