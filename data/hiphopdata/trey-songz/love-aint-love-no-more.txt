Love ain't love no more 
 So baby tell me what's love 
 When there ain't a bit of trust 
 Baby how is we gon win 
 U ain't even my friend no more 
 U know that this ain't even my fault (oh no) 
 But I ain't even mad at all (Naw) 
 Just a little hurt 
 'Cause I know I don't deserve this 
 How can I word this 
 When you hurt, I hurt 
 U cry, I cry 
 U telling me this truths a lie 
 I mean love ain't love no more 
 When you feel ur pain 
 I feel the same 
 U telling me things ain't the same 
 Yes, love ain't love no more 
 Oh how can we call this us 
 When we ain't even making love 
 How can you pretend and 
 We don't even touch no more (no more) 
 I don't ever want you to leave 
 And baby that's plain to see 
 So Ur love I'm addicted, I need me a fix quick 
 Or sum 'em gon go wrong wit me 
 U hurt, I hurt 
 U cry, I cry 
 U telling me this truths a lie 
 I mean love ain't love no more 
 When you feel ur pain 
 I feel the same 
 U telling me things ain't the same 
 Yes, love ain't love no more 
 Baby I'm looking to u 
 2 C what we have got to do (got to do) 
 2 fix this mess that we fell n 
 'Cause I'm not tryna hurt again 
 U gave the price and I paid the cost 
 Don't want to risk anymore loses 
 I can't afford for you to be sad or u 2 be mad 
 'Cause when you hurt 
 U hurt, I hurt 
 U cry, I cry 
 U telling me this truths a lie 
 I mean love ain't love no more 
 When you feel ur pain 
 I feel the same 
 U telling me things ain't the same 
 I guess, love ain't love no more 
 No more I guess love ain't love no more no more no more.
