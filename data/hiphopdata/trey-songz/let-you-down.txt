You love me like 
 Words can't explain 
 For me to feel the same 
 Is all you wanna gain 
 You never claimed 
 That the dollars made me change 
 ... 
 ... 
 Hurt your heart in the worst way 
 Never should've let you fall in the first place 
 But you fallin' put your all in 
 Now you're so high off love you don't wanna get down 
 Most nights she ain't sleep 
 Worrying where I might or might not be 
 Sheesh for the life of me 
 Man what a life I lead 
 You kept me on this pedestal 
 No matter how much I let you down 
 I let you down (down down) 
 With all my infidelities 
 You love me so incredibly 
 Inside I fall apart 
 If you ever love someone 
 Instead of me 
 Instead of me 
 Though you deserve a better man 
 Instead of me 
 Instead of me
