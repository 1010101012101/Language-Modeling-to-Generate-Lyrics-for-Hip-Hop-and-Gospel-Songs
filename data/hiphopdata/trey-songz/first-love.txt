(Feat. Johnta Austin) 
 Woo... Songz Baby 
 But you can call me Tremaine 
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeaa-eh 
 Ooh-Ooh 
 Hey hey 
 Baby I can't even front sometimes I have days 
 Where I really miss your love and it drives me crazy 
 To see you in the arms of another man, livin' out ya plans 
 Plans that we made together 
 Such a shame 
 We ended up this way 
 Deciding that we're better off with others 
 So if he gives you something I can't 
 Girl I'm ok with that 
 Cause at the end of the day 
 All I have to say is 
 Girl you're my heart 
 You could be with him for life 
 That don't change the fact that I'm your first love 
 And I'm so sure 
 I could date another girl and more 
 That don't change the fact that you're my first love 
 Ooh oh 
 I can't even lie sometimes I miss you 
 And sometimes it gets so hard just for me to 
 See you out with another girl, another woman in ya world 
 Holdin' down my spot 
 It's such a shame 
 We ended up this way 
 Deciding that we're better off with others 
 And if she gives you something I can't 
 Than I'm ok with that 
 Cause at the end of the day 
 All I got to say 
 Is boy ya my heart 
 You could be with her for life 
 That don't change the fact that I'm your first love 
 And I'm so sure 
 I could date another man and more 
 That don't change the fact that you're my first love 
 My heart 
 For life 
 That I'm your first love 
 So sure 
 And more 
 That you're my first love
