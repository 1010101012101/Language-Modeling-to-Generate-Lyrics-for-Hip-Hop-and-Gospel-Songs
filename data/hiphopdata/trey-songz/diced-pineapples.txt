Shawty so cold, pussy winter fresh 
 Reservations to eat and you're my dinner guest 
 Shawty cleaned up nice, never been a mess 
 Could take a little pain, I see them tattoos in her flesh 
 But I ain't try to hurt her, 'cause I've always been the best 
 I'm making my shawty feel it till she feel it in her chest 
 Sex excellent, get a hundred when I test 
 I'm a fan of her talent, so I've always been impressed 
 Sex in the city on my black satin sheets 
 Wet as hurricane sandy on the Manhattan streets 
 Lid a few candles like my power hadn't reached 
 Then I took you places that her last nigga hadn't reached 
 Bitch so bad that her parents went through hell 
 Smart mouth when we argue, you were switchy with the yale 
 I wanna touch her, not using my hands 
 Make her dance without using the bands 
 Call me crazy, should at least you call me 
 Feels better when you let it out, don't it, boy? 
 Know is easy to get caught up in the morning 
 When you say 'cause you're mad and you take it all back 
 Then we fuck all night till things get right 
 Then we fuck all night till things get right 
 The club popping but she ain't trying go there 
 Her friends know where she going every time she tell them "nowhere" 
 I'm the only one that get up in the VIP 
 My money grown, baby, ain't no need to see id 
 Slide a some just to come through, host money 
 At least niggas know you're getting through the most money 
 Club my place, you wear what you wanna wear 
 But you're overdressed if you're wearing underwear 
 I turn up, couple J's to burn up 
 Couple spice to hide out, now let that playlist right out 
 Where I live on Sunday, her place Monday 
 Her hand in my pants, call that Al Bundy 
 Pull it out like a pistol, yo, kiss it on the balls like the dick the mistletoe 
 Tell her do the thing I like, best she listen, yo 
 Bad bitch good girl around the Christmas, though 
 Call me crazy, should at least you call me 
 Feels better when you let it out, don't it, boy? 
 Know is easy to get caught up in the morning 
 When you say 'cause you're mad and you take it all back 
 Then we fuck all night till things get right 
 Then we fuck all night till things get right 
 Pussy sweeter as a fresh fruit 
 She good and I drink the best juice 
 I'm drinking till nothing left to 
 And she playing with herself, too 
 I be thinking about her all day 
 She perform like it's broadway 
 Yeah, we hop in the range, she on top of the brain 
 Got the windows down, broad day 
 Just look at her, spectacular 
 The one in stove, flipping like a spatula 
 Other niggers want her, but you see the niggers whack to her 
 Side bitch tripping 'cause I'll never get back to her 
 My bitch like bitches, but none of my bitches bad to her 
 She's a trigger, I never seen her with a bad bitch 
 Unless she's meeting on these other bitches average 
 Hundred percent real while these bitches is plastic 
 Moroccan goddess, she walk like she need her ass kissed 
 Walk like she need her ass kissed 
 Diced pineapples, super fine at you 
 If she's giving head, She's throwing her mind at you 
 Fuck these other bitches, nigger, she don't mind what you do 
 I just wanna watch, I ain't taking time at you, dudes 
 Never faking, why they hella friend? 
 Keep it real with her, yeah, that's what she ever wants 
 Some bout to anchor me, shouldn't never discipline 
 Wondering on the balcony, we're about to smoke another joint 
 Miami on the yacht, she pulling on my pistol saying how she love my cock 
 Metaphoric bliss, shawty, you're the shit 
 Couple days with her, man, that's all I ever get 
 And she got a little sister, that's what she ever with 
 Game like a nigger, man, that's what she ever speak 
 Montreal was our first time, swear pussy just like the first lines 
 Scars on my back, she left couple, spent a couple stacks, had her put a couple pair 
 Try to beg mine, my nigger out of bootie 
 Never retract statements, nigger, I'm never scared 
 Niggers be switching up, but nigger, I'm never weird 
 Back on another leer 
 I leave niggers here, all in another year 
 All in another lane, all in another gear 
 All of you niggers lame, all of your niggers here 
 Listen up, bitch niggers bitching up 
 I guess you're doing what you're supposed to 
 Let a real nigger hold you 
 Back to my baby girl, though, I just need you in my world, yo 
 Call me crazy, should at least you call me 
 Feels better when you let it out, don't it, boy? 
 Know is easy to get caught up in the morning 
 When you say 'cause you're mad and you take it all back 
 Then we fuck all night till things get right 
 Then we fuck all night till things get right
