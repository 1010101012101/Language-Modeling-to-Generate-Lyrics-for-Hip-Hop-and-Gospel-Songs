Talking: 
 "Songbook baby, 
 I like to thank Mr. Bryan Michael Cox for helping me illustrate my feelings. 
 It's just gettin' too hot baby, it's gettin' too hot." 
 This The Last Time, it's the last chapter 
 I mean for real 
 This has gotta be the last time 
 It's gonna be the best though 
 I promise 
 Just one last time 
 'Cause if she catch me with you 
 She gon' kill us 
 These hotel rooms is looking too familiar 
 Your love is so, so serious 
 Girl, you keep me coming back, baby 
 I be with her, thinkin' of you 
 I be with you, thinkin' of her, my boo 
 She just don't deserve this 
 Ain't nobody perfect 
 But I just can't take no more, 'cause... 
 I'm livin' two different lives 
 One girl in the day, you at night 
 And even though this ain't right, 
 I just can't get enough 
 Of the way you put it down 
 You really got me trippin' 
 Hold up, baby girl 
 Don't talk, just listen 
 Let's just make love 
 Girl, for the last time 
 Yep, I said the last time 
 Girl, this is the last time 
 I'm all caught up 
 And it's time to put it down 
 You really got me trippin' 
 Hold up, baby girl, just listen 
 This is the last time 
 See the problem is I'm too deep involved 
 To be playin' with your emotions, 
 You really got me open, oh 
 I gotta figure it out 
 Can't let no pussy come before my baby 
 Not my baby, no 
 'Cause she's the only one to ease my mind 
 But girl you just so fine, oh! 
 Give it to me one last time 
 Baby, let your hair down 
 Take it to the bed now 
 Spread them lovely legs now 
 One last round 
 I'm livin' two different lives 
 One girl in the day, you at night 
 And even though this ain't right, 
 I just can't get enough 
 Of the way you put it down 
 You really got me trippin' 
 Hold up, baby girl 
 Don't talk, just listen 
 Let's just make love 
 Girl, for the last time 
 Yep, I said the last time 
 Girl, this is the last time 
 I'm all caught up 
 And it's time to put it down 
 You really got me trippin' 
 Hold up, baby girl, just listen 
 This is the last time 
 Let me see ya take off your clothes 
 (For the last time) 
 Let's keep this thing on the low 
 (For the last time) 
 Tell me how you wanna get it 
 (Get it) 
 I know ya favorite is the kitchen 
 (Kitchen) 
 From the way I used to kiss it 
 (Woo!) 
 Girl, I know you're gonna miss it 
 But there's only one condition 
 Baby, please don't fuss 
 Don't be trippin', keep it pimpin' 
 Baby girl, let's just make love 
 (For the last time) 
 (For the last time) 
 (For the last time) 
 I'm livin' two different lives 
 I'm livin' two different lives 
 One girl in the day, you at night 
 And even though this ain't right, 
 I just can't get enough
