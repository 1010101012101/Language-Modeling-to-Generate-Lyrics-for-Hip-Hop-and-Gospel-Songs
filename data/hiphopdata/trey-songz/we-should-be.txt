Baby, you're lookin' so lovely, 
 I'm thinkin' 'bout you lovin' me. 
 Kissin' me, touchin' me. 
 Lookin' so lovely, 
 I'm thinkin' 'bout you lovin' me. 
 Kissin' me, touchin' me. 
 I promised you 
 I'd take you out. 
 Enjoy your night, 
 Out on the town. 
 Light dinner and 
 Some champagne. 
 You deserve the best 
 Of the finer thangs. 
 Girl tonight you couldn't look 
 Any better. 
 Amazingly irresistible. 
 I can see it in my mind, 
 Baby you and I, 
 Later on tonight 
 Makin' love. 
 DJ's playin' the last song. 
 We've been dancing all night long. 
 Wanna hold you in my arms. 
 Girl it's time that we get gone. 
 Can't control it any longer. 
 'Cause the feeling's just too strong. 
 Baby you know 
 (It's such a beautiful thing, 
 Way that we be doin' our thang, 
 When we be doin' it) 
 We should be makin' love. 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Love 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Most gorgeous lady in the room, 
 I know you can feel, 
 All eyes are on you, 
 I think they all 
 Are a little envious 
 Of this chemistry 
 That we share between us. 
 So, I don't wanna come off disrespectful. 
 But I can't keep my hands off of you. 
 Girl I'm all over your love, 
 And if I can lay it down, 
 Then right here on the ground, 
 I'd start makin' love to you. 
 DJ's playin' the last song. 
 We've been dancing all night long. 
 Wanna hold you in my arms. 
 Girl it's time that we get gone. 
 I can't control it any longer. 
 'Cause the feeling's just too strong. 
 Baby you know 
 (It's such a beautiful thing, 
 Way that we be doin' our thang, 
 When we be doin' it) 
 We should be makin' love. 
 Maybe in the car, babe. 
 Or maybe we could stop some place. 
 'Cause I don't wanna wait, hey. 
 Until we get all the way home. 
 No, no. 
 You got me hard 
 Grippin' in the third lane. 
 And girl it's only for the sake of your love. 
 (Your love) 
 And all I see is us 
 Makin' love till the sun comes up. 
 I can't wait, 
 [x3] 
 It's such a beautiful thang, 
 Way we be doin' our thang, 
 When we be doin' it. 
 Doin' it, doin' it. 
 DJ's playin' the last song. 
 We've been dancing all night long. 
 Wanna hold you in my arms. 
 Girl it's time that we get gone. 
 Trey can't control it any longer. 
 'Cause the feeling's way too strong. 
 Baby you know 
 (It's such a beautiful thing, 
 Way that we be doin' our thang, 
 When we be doin' it) 
 We should be makin' love. 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Love 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
