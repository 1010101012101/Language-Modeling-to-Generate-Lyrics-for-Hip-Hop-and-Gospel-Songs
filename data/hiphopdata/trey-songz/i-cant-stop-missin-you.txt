 It's everything about you baby, wanna know where you've been lately 
 Do you go out? Do you still live at your old house? 
 Do you got somebody new in your life? 'Cause I can't get you outta my mind 
 And I wanna erase, but I can't stop seein your face 
 And every girl I try to replace you with, why can't I get over with? 
 Simply 'cause I can't...

 Baby '07 supposed to be our year, you confront my worst fears 
 And I had my doubts, every time you was goin' out 
 'Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies and I can't get that outta my mind 
 And I wanna erase, but I can't stop seein your face 
 And every girl I try to replace you with, why can't I get over with?
