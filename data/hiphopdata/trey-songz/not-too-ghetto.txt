I see you standing there 
 So fly from skin to hair 
 Like you don't want nobody close to you 
 Maybe I'm not your style 
 Too street up, just to wild 
 But let me show you what a guy can do 
 So if I'm not too ghetto for you 
 I'd like to get to know you 
 Ooh girl I really wanna grind with chu 
 So if I'm not too ghetto for you 
 Got things I'd like to show you 
 Ooh girl I really wanna (ah) with chu 
 I like the way you walk (walk) 
 And your dirty talk (dirty talk) 
 Girl let me bring out the freak in you 
 I'll take you to my crib 
 Cook up some (?) ribs 
 Do things you never thought a guy can do 
 You don't have to hide me from your kids, your dad your moms 
 I'll put on a suit, show up with flowers or fruit 
 So girl, don't chu get into panic 
 'Cause I can be romantic 
 But if something goes down 
 Trust me I can put it down, So 
 So if I'm not too ghetto for you 
 I'd like to get to know you 
 Ooh girl I really wanna grind with chu 
 So if I'm not too ghetto for you 
 Got things I'd like to show you 
 Ooh girl I really wanna (ah) with chu 
 (x2) 
 Say Ooh (x4) 
 Ooh 
 You don't have to hide me from your kids, your dad your moms 
 I'll put on a suit, show up with flowers or fruit 
 So girl, don't chu get into panic 
 'Cause I can be romantic 
 But if something goes down 
 So if I'm not too ghetto for you 
 I'd like to get to know you 
 Ooh girl I really wanna grind with chu 
 So if I'm not too ghetto for you 
 Got things I'd like to show you 
 Ooh girl I really wanna (ah) with chu 
 Trust me I can put it down, So
