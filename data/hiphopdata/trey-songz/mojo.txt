New shit, new shit 
 Fresh up off the stove though 
 Game in the bag 
 Got a whole lotta mojo 
 Step in the spot 
 And all the women want a photo 
 I guess I'll pose though 
 That's just my mojo 
 Mojo, mojo 
 Whole lotta mojo 
 You can't buy this 
 This ain't in the stores yo 
 Plus I be runnin' through the money like Flo Jo 
 Mojo, mojo, mojo, mojo 
 We can spend money on your fingers and toes 
 I'll put you backstage meet Jeezy and Hov 
 You play your hand right 
 You get spades all night 
 It's the Ace all right 
 You can taste all night 
 Baby chasin' diamonds 
 So I'm steady breakin' hearts 
 Join the club when I touch you 
 Keep 'em on shuffle 
 Chips like Ruffels 
 Feet Ferragamo with the Louise V. duffle 
 Middle name Trouble 
 Finger on Trigga, bustin'; on you all 
 More than 30 G's on the wrist up my sleeve 
 I don't call it a watch though 
 We call it the time-piece 
 Pop-Eye's chicken, I got us a 9-piece 
 Head ten times, so I call it a dime piece 
 I like foreign cars and foreign broads 
 Purple labels and green cash 
 Red women with big ol' ass 
 Mob squad, here goes a smash 
 New shit, new shit 
 Fresh up off the stove though 
 Game in the bag 
 Got a whole lotta mojo 
 Step in the spot 
 And all the women wanna photo 
 I guess I'll pose though 
 That's just my mojo 
 Mojo, mojo 
 Whole lotta mojo 
 You can't buy this 
 This ain't in the stores yo 
 Plus I be runnin' through the money like Flo Jo 
 Mojo, mojo, mojo, mojo
