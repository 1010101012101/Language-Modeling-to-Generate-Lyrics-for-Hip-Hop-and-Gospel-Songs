Ooh oh ooh 
 Whoa ooh ooh 
 For a longest time, I've been on my shine, I'm song 
 Now I'll never let up, I've been wanting this way too long 
 Got me sitting toe high, trying to balance out the lows 
 And I think it's time that I propose 
 Let's make a toast to the dickheads that boast 'cause we get bread 
 Toast to the bad bitches that shit on their ass bitches 
 Everybody think they're Jordan so toast to the Pippens 
 Nobody's the same but we know different 
 We all want this money right 
 Everybody trying to eat like it's money pie 
 I should live 100 lives, I should have 100 wives 
 And the honey-beds, I should tell her 100 lies 
 Then I wonder why, when it's all said and done 
 Tell me what will I become 
 I wanna say that I did learn some, earn some 
 Bad memories I did burn some 
 Sanitize my hands and let the germs gone 
 See you niggers is disgusting 
 Bad bitches worldwide wanna fuck 'em 
 You see they treat my dick like lip balm 
 They know I hit hard, no concussion, come on 
 For a longest time, I've been on my shine, I'm song 
 Now I'll never let up, I've been wanting this way too long 
 Got me sitting toe high, trying to balance out the lows 
 And I think it's time that I propose 
 Let's make a toast to the good times 
 Let's have a toast for the cash flow 
 Make a toast to a new thang 
 On the arm of a bad hoe 
 Make a toast to the bad day 
 So we appreciate the sunrise 
 You still don't understand, stay away as far as you could 
 Stay away, stay away, stay away as far as you could 
 Stay away, stay away, stay away as far as you could 
 Stay away, stay away, stay away as far as you could 
 Still don't understand 
 Stay away as far as you can 
 'Cause girl, I've barely even know, scream loud for me (?) 
 See I'm living life with no boundaries 
 But even a sunny day got clouds you see 
 I'm floating in the air, I live there 
 Laid back chair, call me song (?) 
 I got a big beach, you got a beach chair 
 I'm the big picture and you're just a small square 
 But who am I to say I'm better man 
 I just want this shit forever, man 
 Momma said there will be better days 
 But when better days came 
 I knew there were better thangs 
 I hated me, you telling me this everything 
 Now quit playing man, where's everything? 
 The women are amazing, the liquor's always tasteful 
 The party off the chain 
 But emptiness remains, tell me where's the love that I'm missing? 
 From every day kitchen, or a girl that's really down 'cause I know she's been around 
 I feel like something wrong, but everything's right 
 Hand quotes in the air read left right 
 I ain't trying to bitch, I'm living the blessed life 
 Would I trade it in motherfucker? Yeah, right 
 Black niggers can't hit me nor see me 
 This is the graveyard, death sight 
 For a longest time, I've been on my shine, I'm song 
 Now I'll never let up, I've been wanting this way too long 
 Got me sitting toe high, trying to balance out the lows 
 And I think it's time that I propose 
 Let's make a toast to the good times 
 Let's have a toast for the cash flow 
 Make a toast to a new thang 
 On the arm of a bad hoe 
 Make a toast to the bad day 
 So we appreciate the sunrise 
 You still don't understand, stay away as far as you could 
 Stay away, stay away, stay away as far as you could 
 Stay away, stay away, stay away as far as you could 
 Stay away, stay away, stay away as far as you could 
 Still don't understand 
 Stay away as far as you can 
 If I could stand on a cloud and speak out loud to the world below me 
 To play my name just so that they know me, you see the neighbors know my name 
 Even the haters love my thang, everybody plays my game 
 We've got mental hypocrisy at such high velocities 
 When I speak truth, everybody calls me Socrates 
 I've got such a philosophy that everybody's watching me 
 Looking at their wrist, shit everybody's clocking me 
 Ah, there's no thrill like a slow kill 
 Standing at the bottom looking at the top 
 Hoping that they stop blocking me 
 If I had a day job niggers probably stayed back in me 
 See I hate rules, if you said I obey, you ain't ever know Trey 
 You ain't know I'm season like obey 
 Do re mi sol fa la si do, toss it to the assholes, exclude me through 
 Please, don't involve me in that, see I'm a dignified man with a signified plan 
 And all problems to solve just leave them into his hands
