I like a long-haired red bone 
 Thick with them legs long 
 (Yuuup!) 
 Shawty head strong 
 Blow me till her head gone 
 (Yuuup!) 
 Shawty scream loud 
 (Yuuup!) 
 Shawty gon? moan 
 (Yuuup!) 
 Call that music to my ears; headphones 
 After we get it in, we can head home 
 Then I?ma get ya friend in my bedroom 
 I often fantasize I could get all y?all in the ride 
 Get so much pussy I bet I can guess ya panty size 
 (Whaaaat?!) 
 August 4th is you READY for me girl? 
 I'd fuck you better than them niggas in ya world 
 Lick that kitty kat till she purrs 
 (Meow) 
 Beat it up so bad you wanna curse me out 
 If you top modelin 
 If you Twitter followin 
 It's too many girls I know I'm never gon? sex 
 But we can phone sex 
 Touch your own breast 
 Call my phone; 804-335-0051

 Beep, beep, beep 
 Waitin on Ci Ci 
 See, wanna tell you 'bout a dream I had 
 First time I seen ya ass, dancin on that chair 
 Tank top and sweatpants 
 I want what's under there 
 (Whoa, yeah) 
 You gave me a Fantasy Ride 
 Started when you hopped in my ride 
 Scooped you up from LAX 
 Paparazzi; duckin that 
 So detailed [?] 
 Don't you tell, we was havin' hella sex 
 Dream so vivid that I had to tell it 
 We got busy, girl, I woke up sweatin 
 If we did it girl you won't regret it 
 And if we never did then I'm still happy I said it 
 (Yuuup!)

 (Nope!) 
 My baby's gotta have me, but she wanna make you happy 
 She was posed to come over, but she just wanna console ya 
 And I just wanna do both, ya know? 
 He ain't do what he posed to 
 (Put her back on the phone right quick. Aye, baby) 
 Ya girlfriend can come too 
 'Cause I know just what she goin' through 
 We already know what to do 
 Ya girlfriend can come too 
 And you know you wanna see me, so you might as well bring her too 
 I know she feel bad and you wanna make her feel good 
 If you really, really wanna make he feel good 
 You should let her take part in the things we do 
 And, baby, when we step in the room, ya girlfriend gon? come too
