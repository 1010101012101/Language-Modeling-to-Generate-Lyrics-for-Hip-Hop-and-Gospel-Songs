(Trey Songz: Talking) 
 Aye Swizz, you should'a put me on this 
 Let's go 
 Songz! 
 Chillin' in the Rova, listenin' to Hova 
 Dirt up off of my shoulder, she dig it like a golfer 
 Fitted on lean, while I'm sippin on lean 
 Feelin' on me while she drink it like a soda 
 Freeeze, freeze 
 Tell the fellas it's ova, tell em' he hella colder 
 They ain't better than me, hell, I be frozen over 
 I am never to be thought of nothing but soilder 
 Yup, third degree track, put in the toaster, burt 
 You could, you could, you could 
 You could light a match on that, I could put stacks on that 
 Fact is that, I am like a candle 
 Burn like wax on tracks 
 This man to break a nigga back on tracks 
 Relax for what? I'm a ball till I fall, then I'm right back up 
 White slacked up, Louie V sneakers 
 Singin' to the bitches and spittin' like either 
 Freeze 
 You know who it is 
 It's Songz Nigga 
 Virginia on my back like a spine 
 Spend ten stacks like a dime 
 Put the prince back in his time 
 To bring sense back in the rhymes 
 A lot of dudes spit, but it's few that's intense 
 Like they missin' they mind, and they slip out, I climb 
 Aye, get a grip, catch a line 
 I'm pullin on piff all the time, come and get a wiff 
 All the dummys in this bitch get live 
 Whatever I'm lackin, I'm a get mine 
 There's room for growth, and I'm finna get wide 
 There's room to boast, and I'm finna get fly 
 I speak the truth, while a lot of dudes lie 
 Tell me what you would do if you had to survive 
 I could eat the booth, a lot of dudes would die, not I 
 Who wanna test me?
