What it do what it do 
 Baby beat down 
 Turn you on with something new 
 You so purdry, so true 
 Like the aquifina girl, my body needs 
 (Talk to her) you quench my thirst 
 Through the best through the worst 
 Dance to this song with the bees and the birds 
 We can light on heavenly dubs[? ] 
 My oasis girl 
 We gon face this world 
 Through the killin' and the violence 
 You my keys to survival 
 Like adam in the bible 
 You're my rib, for you I Live 
 Let's bless this ceremony 
 This here is where love be shorty 
 You the queen, Queen of the jungle 
 (For You) Your King gon' rumble 
 If anybody try to break our circle (Our Circle of Love) 
 As the sun cruises through the sky 
 And I look into those eyes 
 I put it all down on the line 
 For the love of my life 
 It's My Love Safari 
 O O Oh My love Safari 
 O O O Oh My love Safari 
 Out the Ghetto, Out the Suit 
 Now we ridin' clean on something brand new 
 The haters mean muggin you 
 Shit I wish they were you 
 Out of all the diamonds and pearls, see you're the finest girl 
 Shawty you so special 
 I wanna love you forever 
 Oasis girl 
 We gon face this world 
 Through the killin' and the violence 
 You my keys to my survival 
 Like adam in the bible 
 You're my rib, for you I Live 
 Let's bless this ceremony 
 This here is where love be shorty 
 You the queen, Queen of the jungle 
 (For You) Your King gon' rumble 
 If anybody try to break our circle (Our Circle of Love) 
 As the sun cruises through the sky 
 And I look into those eyes 
 I put it all down on the line 
 For the love of my life 
 It's My Love Safari 
 Baby girl, you know your love is sacred to me 
 I wouldn't give it up for nothing in this world 
 I would travel a thousand miles across the sea 
 To be with you, to stay with you, and live in unity 
 My love safari 
 That's what it is 
 My love safari, our love safari 
 Shawty You the queen, Queen of the jungle 
 (For You) Your King gon' rumble 
 If anybody try to break our circle (Our Circle of Love) 
 As the sun cruises through the sky 
 And I look into those eyes 
 I put it all down on the line 
 For the love of my life 
 Shawty You the queen, Queen of the jungle 
 (For You) Your King gon' rumble 
 If anybody try to break our circle (Our Circle of Love) 
 As the sun cruises through the sky 
 And I look into those eyes 
 I put it all down on the line 
 For the love of my life 
 It's My Love Safari
