Reminising I remember me and you we used to play with the dogs 
 While you were sleep id stare, stare while you lay in my arms 
 And now I'm stuck on stupid rain forrest couldn't get wetter than you get 
 I used to beat it up you gave me your love I abused it now I'm facing the music 
 Oh how I yearn for your touch I'm so lonely now that you left me 
 If I could run away you know I would 
 And I'm hurtin' cause girl I never loved you like I should 
 When your love is lost 
 Your whole worlds thrown off 
 When the one you need don't need you 
 What do you do when love is lost 
 I was trippin' wouldn't listen now I'm sitting sipping shots at the bar 
 Now I'm riding to the 90's hits listening to aerosmith 
 I don't wanna close my eyes don't wanna fall asleep 
 Tell me how I can I be fly without the wind beneath my wings 
 Oh how I yearn for your touch I'm so lonely now that you left me 
 If I could run away you know I would 
 And I'm hurtin' cause girl I never loved you like I should 
 When your love is lost 
 Your whole worlds thrown off 
 When the one you need don't need you 
 What do you do when love is lost 
 And now I see 
 The man you need 
 When I look into the mirror I see change 
 And I close my eyes and wish you could see the same 
 But it's too late 
 When your love is lost 
 Your whole worlds thrown off 
 When the one you need don't need you 
 What do you do 
 When your love is lost 
 Your whole worlds thrown off 
 When the one you need don't need you 
 What do you do when love is lost 
 Lost gone out the window 
 When love is lost 
 Lost can't see your love no more 
 When the one you need don't need you 
 What do you do when love is lost
