 Trey Songz: 
 Shw got my back (OH)... 
 And I got hers (yes) 
 Got me trickin off (oh) 
 Diamonds and Furs (yes) 
 Not the money and the cars 
 All I want is you 
 High heels in the benz color powder blue 
 Baby I'm in love with you (you) 
 And all I want is you (you) 
 It's me and you against the world 
 But how'd you get me like this 
 You must know some kind of voodoo 
 We started we we gon finish with your hand in my hand we partners, we gon get it like nobody else can I'm all for you my heart is you we got this master plan you ask me about my baby I'm a say... 
 When the bus stop runnin' and the train stop comin' and the ship goes under... Know we in this thing togetha togetha togetha ooh 
 And when the clock stops tickin and when the sunshine missin' ain't nobody else fix it 
 Know we in this thing togetha togetha togetha
