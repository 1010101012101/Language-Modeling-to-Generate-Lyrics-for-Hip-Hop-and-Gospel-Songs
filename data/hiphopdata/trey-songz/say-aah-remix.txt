 (Verse 3: Juelz Santana) 
 Diamonds on glow, glow 
 Pockets on low, low I be 
 On the hot but the bottles be on cold chill 
 Niggas know what's up with me ladies wanna jump on me 
 I'm so fly dat the sky look up to me 
 Table full of models bottles gangsta with cases 
 'Cause they got court tomorrow sheesh 
 Hustlers feel like they might get caught tomorrow sheesh 
 And that's why we party like there is no tomorrow sheesh 
 Wow I think I like her the way she go round like a syfa 
 Make me wanna growl like a tiger 
 You shot me like owww let me bite ya 
 (Verse 4: Fabolous) 
 I make you say ah just like I'm your doctor 
 All I prescribe is cranberry and vodka 
 Then I'm tryna kick it play a lil socca 
 Then bust a couple off blocka blocka 
 The henny in your system you start drunk texting and suddenly you miss him 
 Or even wanna diss him 
 Then you call your girl like what the hell you gave me 
 She like don't blame me better do like Jamie 
 And blame it on the liquor nice
