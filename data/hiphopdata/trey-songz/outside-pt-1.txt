I don't want nobody more than you 
 Just want your body on this morning dew 
 I got these covers laying right for us 
 Ain't nobody looking, it's just mother nature watching us 
 I feel like tonight we should switch it up 
 No couch, no bed, no kitchen floor 
 Uh, can I take your body on a ride 
 Take you to the park, then hit it on the slide 
 I basically, wanna do it to you outside 
 Top down with the stars looking inside 
 Always wanted to do you in the pool, 
 And all night all our light is the moon 
 I don't want nobody more than you 
 I Just want your body on this morning dew 
 Now, I got these covers laying right for us 
 Ain't nobody looking, it's just mother nature watching us 
 Outside, front seat of my car, underneath the stars 
 Let's make love 
 Outside, I don't really care, if anybody sees us 
 Making love, I want you to keep going baby 
 Making love, I don't care if they call us crazy 
 Outside, I don't even care, anyone can stare 
 While we're outside 
 If you catch someone looking all you gotta do is close your eyes 
 Girl don't you say a peep, dig your nails into my spine 
 We can take it to the roof top baby, 
 Or the elevator then take it to the roof top baby 
 With you on top baby, no need to be curious about what I'm gonna do 
 I wanna make your you know storm tonight 
 I don't want nobody more than you 
 Just want your body on this morning dew 
 I got these covers laying right for us 
 Ain't nobody looking, it's just mother nature watching us 
 Outside, front seat of my car, underneath the stars 
 Let's make love 
 Outside, I don't really care, if anybody sees us 
 Making love, I want you to keep going baby 
 Making love, I don't care if they call us crazy 
 Outside, I don't even care, anyone can stare 
 While we're outside 
 I don't want nobody more than you 
 Just want your body on this morning dew 
 I got these covers laying right for us 
 Ain't nobody looking, it's just mother nature watching us.
