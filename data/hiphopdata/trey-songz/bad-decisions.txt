Turn the lights on 
 She said I took way too long coming home last night 
 Said I be messin' with all these women 
 I been doing so wrong, wish I could make it right 
 Me and my bad decisions. 
 Guess it's my fault for not believing she could love, love me... 
 Hard to believe I treated someone beautiful so ugly... 
 Guess I broke to pieces her heart 
 Got used to seeing her crying, 'cause I went and pushed it too far 
 She got sick and tired of me lying... yeah 
 She said I took way too long coming home last night

 She's gone, gone, gone... 
 (I should have) Should have listened (Should have listened), but I didn't..(Me and my bad decisions) 
 She said she move on, on, on 
 And now I'm trippin'.. should have listened... 
 Now I got time to think of all I could have done... different 
 Searched the whole world until I realized the one I needed is right there... I was trippin' 
 (Wanna) but I know you know I love you... 
 (Don't I) never taken time to tell you... 
 (So I) know that shit don't even matter right now 'cause I'm the reason that your heart shattered right now... 
 (And I) I know how to fuck a good thing up... 
 (And I) I ain't about to lose your love but that shit don't even matter right now 
 'Cause I'm the reason that yo heart shattered right now.

 Ooh god knows I've done some wild and crazy things in my past 
 And I can't take nothing back (Can't take nothing back) 
 Can't do nothing bad... 
 Forced to live with it 
 Always making these bad decisions...
