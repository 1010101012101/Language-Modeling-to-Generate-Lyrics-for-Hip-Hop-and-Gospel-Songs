(Talking: Trey Songz) 
 When I first heard this shit (C'mon) 
 I told Drake it shoulda been called, over for these other niggas 
 Yeah, (haha) It's my turn 
 I know way too many people mad right now 
 'Cause I made a lot of cash here 
 Get up off my balls 
 I swear feels like the past few years 
 I done pass my peers but I just can't remember 'em all 
 What am I doin', what I am doin' 
 Oh yeah that's right I'm doin' amazin' 
 I'm fucking amazin' 
 I'm gettin' mine right now man 
 You niggas had a run but it's over, said it's over 
 I tried to tell ya 
 Ay, father I'm at awe, of everything you give to me 
 Praying negativity will never ever live in me 
 Ain't nobody wrote mine, ain't nobody co-signed 
 'Member hanging clothes on my Aunt Felicia clothes line 
 'Member telling hoes I'm a blow cause of my dope rhyme 
 Coulda never told I'd be singing when it's showtime 
 Solar eclipse back when son got no shine 
 5 years later I arrive, no time 
 I been nuts, it's just nobody rode mine 
 Got my own lane now, shit the whole road's mine 
 I feel HOV at his best, blueprint 
 I'm heel-toes at they neck, shoe print 
 Peep the way I kick it, like a sneaker to the beat 
 R.I.P. like the Reaper took the beat 
 Instrumental killer, desert eagle to the beat 
 See, I'm stronger than the strongest so the weak will never eat (ay) 
 I know way too many people mad right now 
 'Cause I made a lot of cash here 
 Get up off my balls 
 I swear feels like the past few years 
 I done pass my peers but I just can't remember 'em all 
 What am I doin', what I am doin' 
 Oh yeah that's right I'm doin' amazin' 
 I'm fucking amazin' 
 I'm gettin' mine right now man 
 You niggas had a run but it's over, said it's over 
 I tried to tell ya 
 Mother fuck the world, my mother fucked my daddy 
 Then my mother fuckin' had me, now I'm popping like some acne 
 Mother fuck my daddy, guess I'm still mad we 
 Never had a real talk about it, it's my life so who the fuck were you to walk up out it 
 And I be trying hard to forget about it, still I 'member everything about it 
 Excuse my emotional discharge, I'm blossoming often 
 I wanna call but get pissed off 
 As I oppose the top, I'm only getting lonelier 
 Everything that was real is only seeming phonier 
 Tryna see how many mill I can pony up 
 Find somebody grown to fuck, lemme call Toni up (Nigga What?!) 
 They used to go, whose he? that's word to moo me 
 Paper on these books, no looseleaf, truly 
 If the throne's behind the door, u see I'm at it like a new reef 
 Watch back, pardon 'scuse me 
 I know way too many people mad right now 
 'Cause I made a lot of cash here 
 Get up off my balls 
 I swear feels like the past few years 
 I done pass my peers but I just can't remember 'em all 
 What am I doin', what I am doin' 
 Oh yeah that's right I'm doin' amazin' 
 I'm fucking amazin' 
 I'm gettin' mine right now man 
 You niggas had a run but it's over, said it's over 
 I tried to tell ya 
 You niggas had a run but it's over, said it's over 
 I tried to tell ya
