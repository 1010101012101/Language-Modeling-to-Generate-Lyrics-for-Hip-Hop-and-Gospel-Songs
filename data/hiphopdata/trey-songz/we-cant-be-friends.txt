Look at what this girl done did to me, 
 She done cut me off from her good, good love. 
 She told me that those days was gone 
 (Oh, oh, oh) 
 Now I'm sittin' here goin' halfway crazy 
 (Oh, oh, oh) 
 'Cause I know she still thinks about me too 
 (Oh, oh) 
 And it ain't no way in hell that I can be just friends with you 
 (You, you, you) 
 And I wish we never did it, and I wish we never loved it, and I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends 
 The way it felt, no faking it. maybe we were moving just a little too fast. 
 But what we've done we can't take it back (back, back, back) 
 Now I'm sitting here halfway crazy 
 (Oh, oh) 
 'Cause I know she still thinks about me too 
 (Oh, oh) 
 And it ain't no way in hell that I can be just friends with you 
 (Oh, oh) 
 And I wish we never did it, and I wish we never loved, and I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends. 
 And all I can say is: (la 7x's) laaaa (la 9x's) la la la oh (la 7x's) 
 Hey, ain't no telling what we could've been (ain't no tellin' what we could've been, no) 
 And if I knew it ends like this 
 I never would've kissed you 'cause I fell in love with you 
 We never would've kicked it 
 Girl, every thing's different 
 I've lost my own recoverin' my friend 
 I wish we never did it 
 And I wish we never loved it, 
 And I wish I never fell so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends 
 (La 23x's) 
 (Ain't no tellin' when we can be friends)
