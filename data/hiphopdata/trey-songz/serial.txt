Wish I lost the keys to my Rover 
 Wish I lost the number to my chauffeur 
 But she begging me to come over 
 Even though I know I shouldn't go over 
 I'm no my way to her place, am I ever gonna learn my lesson? 
 All these sins disguised as blessings 
 Never, first we kissed, you tell all our private conversations 
 I know damn well I'll go through hell from falling for your temptations 
 She said let her go 
 She said let her go 
 So what I do better now? 
 She said pull it now 
 But don't pull it out 
 So what I do? Sweat it out 
 Man, I'm too old for this shit 
 Man, I'm too grown for this shit 
 If I want it, I'mma go get it 
 This is all too familiar 
 Man, I'm too old for this shit 
 Man, I'm too grown for this shit 
 If I want it, I'mma go get it 
 I'm a serial killer 
 I'm a killer 
 I'm a killer 
 I'm a killer 
 I'm a killer 
 Wish I wasn't on your wish list 
 Now I'm wrapping you like Christmas 
 Wish I was a little stronger mentally 
 Then I wouldn't be so weak physically 
 Having my way below your waist, am I ever gonna learn my lesson? 
 Never, first we kissed, you tell all our private conversations 
 I know damn well I'll go through hell from falling for your temptations 
 She said let her go 
 She said let her go 
 So what I do better now? 
 She said pull it now 
 But don't pull it out 
 So what I do? Sweat it out 
 Man, I'm too old for this shit 
 Man, I'm too grown for this shit 
 If I want it, I'mma go get it 
 This is all too familiar 
 Man, I'm too old for this shit 
 Man, I'm too grown for this shit 
 If I want it, I'mma go get it 
 I'm a serial killer 
 I'm a killer 
 I'm a killer 
 I'm a killer 
 I'm a killer 
 Swear it's so crazy that every night 
 I love a new woman up in my life 
 She's seen some dope shit that she's never seen 
 I give her dope 'cause she's just a fiend 
 Woman I love, why don't you leave me? 
 It may be hard, but it's never easy 
 Girl, why you trust me, why you believe me? 
 You should say fuck me, girl you don't need me 
 I'm always on some other shit 
 Paying more attention to the one I'm going home with 
 Am I gonna change? I don't know if I'm strong enough to ever let it go 
 If you stick around till I'm out, no matter who it is 
 I'll always know it 
 Never, first we kissed, you tell all our private conversations 
 I know damn well I'll go through hell from falling for your temptations 
 She said let her go 
 She said let her go 
 So what I do better now? 
 She said pull it now 
 But don't pull it out 
 So what I do? Sweat it out 
 Man, I'm too old for this shit 
 Man, I'm too grown for this shit 
 If I want it, I'mma go get it 
 This is all too familiar 
 Man, I'm too old for this shit 
 Man, I'm too grown for this shit 
 If I want it, I'mma go get it 
 I'm a serial killer 
 I'm a killer 
 I'm a killer 
 I'm a killer 
 I'm a killer
