My heart is beating fast 
 My hands won't stop shaking 
 I thought that we would last 
 I thought that we would make it 
 I guess I was wrong all along 
 We were inseparable but apart we've grown 
 So, Can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone 
 When you look around your all alone cause all the right went wrong 
 Tell me how you look into my face and say baby I can't stay 
 What do you do when the love just fades away? 
 The situations ugly 
 I miss the way you touch me 
 Do you even want me anymore? 
 Let me know... 
 'Cause I'm tryna to figure us out 
 I don't wanna break up 
 What's the use when there's nothing left 
 Can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone 
 When you look around your all alone cause all the right went wrong 
 Tell me how you look into my face and say baby I can't stay 
 What do you do when the love just fades away? 
 Was this ever true? 
 Did I ever love you? 
 Baby we were caught up in the feeling 
 Oh did you ever care for me 'cause if so then where'd it go? 
 Are we giving up I need to know or are we holding on 
 Can you tell me what to do when all the feelings is gone 
 When you look around your all alone cause all the right went wrong 
 Tell me how you look into my face and say baby I can't stay 
 What do you do when the love just fades away?
