(Yes, no, maybe) 
 You used to love me 
 Before I even was me 
 You used to hug me 
 Lick me, suck me, kiss me, fuck me 
 Kinda spent a lot of money on you 
 I invest in your dreams 
 I ain't ever fronted on you 
 Girl, you know what that means 
 (All mine, all mine, all mine 
 She says all mine, baby) 
 But somehow I knew she was a liar 
 She's a liar 
 Am I tripping? Am I bugging? 
 Is it over? Tell me something 
 You don't call me no more, who you fucking? 
 Tell me what it is, tell me what I did 
 Where you go? Are you coming home 
 Any time soon? 
 Any time soon? 
 Don't do this to me baby 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 (But I ain't really tripping if you ain't tryna come back 
 Fuck that, you can stay wherever you at) 
 I'm sorry for talking crazy 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 (I just wanna know, are you playing games with my heart? 
 Could've sworn that you swore, never change from the start) 
 I'm sorry for talking crazy 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 (I just wanna know, how you gon' try to help me?) 
 (Tell me where the fuck would you be without me?) 
 I'm sorry for talking crazy 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 Don't do this to me, baby 
 Don't do this to me, baby 
 (I just wanna know) 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 I've been selfish 
 I can't help it 
 Whole lotta years, whole lotta tears 
 Bullshit that you dealt with 
 But you let me 
 And you left me 
 I really think that I 
 Could've made you my girl some day 
 Oh, but how foolish am I 
 To think that you'd have to wait? 
 Like you never had shit, like you ain't a bad bitch 
 That could get her ass kissed from a nigga mad rich 
 But I'm missing that lift, rolling up a spliff 
 Got away your tongue twist 
 Getting lifted, tripping off dumb shit 
 You the only one that could make me come quick 
 You know I love you 
 I hope he fuck up too 
 Where you go? 
 Are you coming home any time soon? 
 Are you, any time soon? 
 Don't do this to me 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 (But I ain't really tripping if you ain't tryna come back 
 Fuck that, you can stay wherever you at) 
 I'm sorry for talking crazy 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 (I just wanna know, are you playing games with my heart? 
 Could've sworn that you swore, never change from the start) 
 I'm sorry for talking crazy 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 (I just wanna know, how you gon' try to help me?) 
 (Tell me where the fuck would you be without me?) 
 I'm sorry for talking crazy 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 Don't do this to me, baby 
 Don't do this to me, baby 
 (I just wanna know) 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 Seems like I can't have it 
 This could not be real 
 Got it off saying I was done 
 But when you're in love with someone 
 You can run it 
 Running back 
 I'm running 
 Running back 
 (But I ain't really tripping if you ain't tryna come back 
 Fuck that, you can stay wherever you at) 
 I'm sorry for talking crazy 
 Yes, no, maybe 
 (I just wanna know, are you playing games with my heart?

 Don't do this to me, baby 
 Don't do this to me, baby 
 Yes, no, maybe
