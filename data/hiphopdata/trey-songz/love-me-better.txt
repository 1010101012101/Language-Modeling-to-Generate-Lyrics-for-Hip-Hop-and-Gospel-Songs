Here we go again... 
 Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh 
 Here we go again... 
 Told you from get go I would never let go 
 We remain eternal, hope you know like I know 
 Imma always love ya when nobody else does 
 Imma be the shelter you can always run to 
 Your the one I run to when I need a shoulder 
 I'm the one you run to when you need a soldier 
 Say that I'm the realest one you ever met 
 Girl this is the realest thing I ever said 
 If you give me the world then I won't need nothing 
 (Wont need nothing, wont need nothing. oh) 
 'Cause if you leave my world then I won't have nothing 
 (Wont have nothing, wont have nothing) 
 And this is from my heart 
 (Eh eh) 
 This is from my soul 
 (Eh eh) 
 Lovers may come 
 (Eh eh) 
 And lovers may go 
 (Eh eh) 
 But I don't worry 'bout a thing 
 'Cause as long as we're together 
 Baby I know I know I know 
 I know I know I knooow that 
 No one's gunna love me better 
 (Eh eh) 
 No one's gunna love me better 
 (Eh Eh) 
 No one's gunna love me 
 You the one I'm cool with you know what to do with 
 Everything I'm givin' baby you know who the truth is 
 You know where the safe at you know who my boo is 
 Never had a fake bag always on that new shit 
 You the only beat that can play in my heart 
 Imagine just to think of us apart 
 Say that I'm the realest one you ever met 
 Girl this is the realest thing I ever said (ever said) 
 If you give me the world then I won't need nothing 
 (Wont need nothing, wont need nothing. oh) 
 'Cause if you leave my world then I won't have nothing 
 (Wont have nothing, wont have nothing) 
 And this is from my heart 
 (Eh eh) 
 This is from my soul 
 (Eh eh) 
 Lovers may come 
 (Eh eh) 
 And lovers may go 
 (Eh eh) 
 But I don't worry 'bout a thing 
 'Cause as long as we're together
