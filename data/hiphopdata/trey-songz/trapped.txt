You know how we do! 
 When I look in the mirror 
 I swear, that I don't even know myself 
 It's like I'm staring at a stranger 
 All I wanted was love. 
 But it seems I found 
 My way to hell. 
 Cause this girl has suck the life out of me. 
 Happiness is a memory 
 You're a mess of the. [? ] 
 I'm getting a text saying she's only thinking 'bout me. 
 I can't believe I'm so hit through all this drama (yeah) 
 I wish I could leave but emotions got me. so stuck. 
 I wonder how it flew in so [? ] 
 She got me rapped so tight I can't breathe. 
 Wanna break the way that my heart is in your blood. 
 And she knows it 
 So I feel like I'm trapped 
 I'm trapped 
 I'm trapped 
 I'm trapped 
 I'm trapped 
 I'm trapped 
 I wonder how it flew in 
 I'm trapped 
 I'm trapped 
 I'm trapped 
 I'm trapped 
 Wonder how it flew in 
 She's got me always persuading. 
 I do what she wants me to 
 And it's the truth. 
 (?) 
 It's like she knows my every move.
