Girl, this is for you 
 Only for you 
 I'll be going nowhere 
 I didn't even know I can 
 Oh baby 
 You think I'm crazy 
 Just tell me that you and me are done 
 Just me, love you 
 Go again 
 I got you baby, I got you 
 You ain't never gon find another man 
 Just me, for you 
 Girl I'm proud to die 
 If it took your love somewhere 
 Don't you even try, no 
 Want to take your love
