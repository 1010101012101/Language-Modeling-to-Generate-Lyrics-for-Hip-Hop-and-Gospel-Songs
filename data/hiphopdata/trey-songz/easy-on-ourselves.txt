Where do we go from here 
 We mustn't fight but then it's right, it's right 
 We make up then make love 
 It's sad to say, our love is fading away 
 We don't communicate no more 
 Tell me why 
 When I come home 
 We barely speak, feels like we're enemies 
 This can't be happening girl 
 Do you believe that we still got it 
 When you get on my last nerves 
 And you think that I'm a jerk 
 Can we make it work 
 But when you're done, all you can do 
 Tears you've been crying, so sick of trying 
 We use to be one 
 Now we're two different people, no longer equals 
 Girl, lets make it easy on ourselves 
 And it's so hard to let it go, but we both know girl 
 Lets make it easy on ourselves 
 Eating us up inside, the way to make it right 
 Lets make it easy on ourselves 
 We saw it coming a long time ago 
 Like when you forgot my birthday 
 And I call you out, your name 
 This soul is sad at home, when nobody is there 
 Never said it would be fair girl 
 To late to mend a broken heart 
 To late we fell apart 
 And goodbye is all we have left to say 
 Can't say we didn't try, dry your eyes 
 Girl you'll always be my first love
