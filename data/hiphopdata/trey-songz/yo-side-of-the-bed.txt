Trey Songz - Yo Side Of The Bed Lyrics and Video 
 Every time she leaves it's my heart that she's taken from me 
 I don't know if she's gone for good or returning in the morning 
 Cannot wait through the night 'cause I can't help the tossing and turning 
 I want you to know that our bed, our sheets, our pillows get lonely 
 On... Yo side of the bed 
 Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, 
 Yo... On yo side of the bed (x3) 
 Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side (it's so lonely there) 
 I don't wanna sleep if you ain't here... no 
 I just wanna breathe your air 
 Watch you when your wrapping up your hair 
 Gazing at the mirrors up there, I'm reaching while imagining that you're here 
 Awake through the night 'cause I can't help the tossing and turning 
 I want you to know that our bed, our sheets, our pillows get lonely 
 On... Yo side of the bed 
 Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, 
 Yo... On yo side of the bed 
 Yo side, Yo side,(where I lay my head) Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, 
 Yo... On yo side of the bed 
 Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, 
 Yo... On yo side of the bed 
 Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side (it's so lonely there) 
 I don't wanna sleep if you ain't here... no 
 Guitar solo: (Trey Talks) 
 Play on... 
 That's what you gotta do sometimes 
 Let it play baby... 
 So lonely there... 
 On... yo side of the bed 
 Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, 
 Yo... On yo side of the bed 
 Yo side, Yo side,(your pillow is waiting girl, pillow is waiting girl) Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, 
 Yo... On yo side of the bed 
 Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, 
 Yo... On yo side of the bed 
 Yo side, Yo side, Yo side, Yo side (it's so lonely there) 
 I don't wanna sleep if you ain't here... no
