Wassup world? It's ..., know me as Trey Songz 
 Some of you would like to know Tremain, very few do 
 And I would like to welcome you all to a place you may have never been before 
 And I'm happy to be back where I am 
 ... You just come along for a ride this evening 
 This morning, this afternoon, whatever it is where you're at 
 I feel like this is something special and I've been here before but it 
 Feels like I've been gone too long, yeah baby 
 Feels like I've been gone too long, I 
 Feel like I've been gone too long 
 And wow, listening to this some of you may say it's shit, 
 Nigger just drop the album, fuck you man 
 But this is a special place once again I mention 
 Yeah, another mix tape, 
 Last mix tape I did was an anticipation all original music 
 Sold for sex ... without to have you 
 Compared to be greater than any album I've ever made, some people say 
 You know, when I do mix tapes it's a place where I recall without inhibitions and thoughts 
 What's right or what's wrong, what's gonna play on the radio who will say it's hot, who not 
 It's for the people out there just know I love you back and the haters I'm trying to love you too, 
 Until then I just tunnel you 
 Yeah, I just want you all to understand something right now 
 That in life you have choices, you have choices to do whatever the fuck you wanna do 
 You got choices to do what people want you to do 
 And right now I'm at the point of my life where I'm gonna do what the fuck I'm wanna do 
 So sit back and relax, ... that you hear this is ... you never heard my voice before 
 Listen with a new air, listen with a new mind 
 Feels like I've been gone too long, 
 Feels like I've been gone too long, I 
 Feel like I've been gone too long.
