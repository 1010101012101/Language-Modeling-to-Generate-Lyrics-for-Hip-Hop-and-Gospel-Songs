Trey Songz - Black Roses Lyrics and Video 
 Eeeh eeeh eeh eeh 
 Yuppp! 
 Who knew we would be where we are here today 
 Yeah 
 Who knew that your heart had to cause our break 
 Girl 
 Ain't gone be (??) trough the pain you would stay 
 I guess... life is no fare no no 
 Just listen to me, we can't go on 
 Pretending to be, like we're so strong (strong) 
 Love (love), gone (gone), gone with the wind 
 I've got something to give to you 
 Yupp 
 Black Roses for this dyin' love 
 Now we're breakin' up 
 Since we're givin' up 
 Black Roses and everybody?(??) 
 Special delivery just for you and i 
 Who knew our love would ever be 
 Called a memory 
 Who knew my home for happyness 
 Would soon be misery 
 Hate that we're so distant girl do you even miss me at all 
 I guess... life is no fare no no no 
 Just listen to me we can't go on 
 Pretending to be, like we're so strong (strong) 
 Love (love), gone (gone), gone with the wind 
 I've got something to give to you 
 Black Roses for this dyin' love 
 Now we're breakin' up 
 Since we're givin' up 
 Black Roses and everybody? (??) 
 Special delivery just for you and i 
 Brigde 
 Can't sleep can't eat (no) 
 I can't erase the pain (no) 
 'Cause I still feel your heart beat (Yupp) 
 Million miles away (I can't) 
 I can't think, can't sleep (no) 
 I can't erase the pain (no) 
 'Cause I still feel your heart beat (Yupp) 
 Million miles away 
 I can't think, can't sleep, can't eat 
 Can't erase the pain (no) 
 'Cause I still feel your heart beat 
 A Million miles away 
 Black Roses for this dyin' love 
 Now we're breakin' up 
 Since we're givin' up 
 Black Roses and everybody? (??) 
 Special delivery just for you and i 
 Black Roses, Black Roses.
