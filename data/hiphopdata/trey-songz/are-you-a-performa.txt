Walk up in the club, shortie, hangin' from da ceillin' 
 Ten thousand one's, mama lookin' like a million 
 Grown man hang, no place fo da children 
 I know dis is Atlanta but I'm still talkin' Ginia 
 Me and money bags tradin' musta seen us through the mirror 
 They all lined up 
 ('Cause) 
 Just to get near us 
 I swear in Miami was a chick just like it 
 She bent down, backed up and did the motor cycle 
 Oh baby, you lookin' so fantabulaso 
 You makin' me wanna chase you for the besto 
 I'm just a hustla, I dem otha niggaz tipo 
 Smoke some furnest up, an' cause a little trouble 
 Oh, you know you doin' ya thing

 The show you givin' me is insane 
 And I just wanna know one thing

 Damn and I can see from a new bitty level 
 Stuffed up in them jeans is a thing that is so swole 
 An' I can dance on you like poppin' on a local 
 Trick you like a tazer 'cause ya body goin' down so slow 
 Damn you know you doin' ya thing 
 Queen, can I be your king? 
 The show you givin' is insane 
 And I just wanna know one thing

 Now 50 had '21 Questions' but I only got one 
 Are you a performa? Are you that one? 
 Do you dance in ya room by yourself? 
 You could do it, do it till you're off breathe 
 Yeah, she got a arch in her back 
 Yeah, she know how to throw it back 
 Yeah, I think, I like it like dat 
 Yeah, I'm a spin a couple stacks 
 Any time she walk by it seem like we caught eye 
 Anotha sweat, anotha style, den, shortie, talk fly 
 Then stand on the beach, she make grands on her feet 
 I gotta see ya once a week, I think shortie own me 
 Or could it be she diggin' me, a couple shots of Hennessey 
 In between the sheets in a suite is where we fina be 
 Lights off, dress gone nibble on my neck bone 
 Sayin' dat she love me, while she scratchin' wit her press on's 
 (Press on's) 
 Are you a peforma?
