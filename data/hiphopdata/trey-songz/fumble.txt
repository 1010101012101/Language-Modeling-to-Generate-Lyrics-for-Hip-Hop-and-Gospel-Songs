We were so dumb in love 
 Couldn't get enough, no 
 But I could've loved you so much better 
 And I can't believe you never walked out 
 And it's not your fault 
 That I fumbled your heart 
 Should've let go of my past for you 
 You did everything I asked of you 
 Drive across the country if I asked you to 
 But I'm just bad for you 
 I fumbled your heart 
 I'm bad news, yeah I'm just bad for you 
 I'm bad news, I fumbled your heart 
 Girl you used to feel so bound in my arms 
 I wish we could touch some more (and it's eating me alive) 
 I'm sitting, working on this letter (and I prove myself it's done) 
 The first line I write, I was wrong 
 So wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong 
 And it's not your fault 
 It's so wrong, it's so wrong, it's so wrong 
 That I fumbled your heart 
 Should've let go of my past for you 
 You did everything I asked of you 
 Drive across the country if I asked you too 
 But I'm just bad for you 
 I fumbled your heart 
 I'm bad news, yeah I'm just bad for you 
 I'm bad news, I fumbled your heart 
 It's all or nothing 
 Give you my all or nothing 
 Want all of you or nothing 
 I'm sorry that I messed up girl 
 I really love you, really really love you 
 Now that I know I love you 
 I'll never love another girl 
 And it's not your fault 
 That I fumbled your heart 
 Should've let go of my past for you 
 I should've let go 
 You did everything I asked of you 
 Drive across the country if I asked you too 
 Whatever I asked you to, I'm just bad for you 
 I fumbled your heart 
 She said I ain't gonna change 
 Ever since the day we met 
 And her mama said the same 
 I dropped the ball I'm so ashamed 
 I'm bad news, real bad news, I fumbled your heart
