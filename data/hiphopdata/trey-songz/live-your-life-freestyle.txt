So these instrumentals they get out on the internet, right 
 Bobby fisher put 'em on the jumpdrive 
 I then take the jumpdrive downstairs 
 I record the record I put it on the jumpdrive 
 I then proceed to take the jump drive back upstairs Mp3 ready 
 The records then emailed to DJ Foot before anyone else 
 DJ Sense will get the next email 
 Then it's to you baby, the world 
 Youtube, comments, blogs, boards, (I do this) 
 Cause nothing is safe (Yeah!) 
 Game who gone play today 
 Guess it's gone be Trey today 
 Reppin for VA today 
 Ignorin what a hater say 
 Got my own lane 
 Guess it's safe to say I paved the way 
 Playin' like the Lakers back in '88 
 MJ fade away in '98 
 Safe to say that I am great 
 You could say I'm hungry 
 I could eat a lions plate 
 I'm a carnivore, I said before 
 It's breakfast time, I'm spittin' out metaphors 
 I guess I'm hella bored 
 Or hella talented 
 Who else could flip this nigga Tip shit like I done did 
 Do two songs 'fore I hit the airport 
 In my wifebeater, in my air shorts 
 Dre'd head phones 
 Trey head gone 
 Pick a line, any rhyme, and it's dead homes 
 'Cause I kill beats, like a still beast 
 And it's still peace, if you don't feel me 
 'Cause I'm still me, and I'm filthy 
 Living my life until they kill me 
 Don't believe I'm dope you must be smokin' on that real D 
 This a real G you facin, no not Mason 
 I am just amazin, skill and grace 
 They extra though, like episodes of Will and Grace 
 Smokin' presidential while I chill gettin' face 
 I'm so Bill Clinton, the head of my state 
 This ain't nothing new though 
 Catch me out on Pluto 
 I'm outta this world 
 Where in the world are you though? 
 Some where back there 
 Like back back where 
 My fans got me, they will never drop me 
 That's exactly why I say that they can never stop me 
 Everything I do is cold, Appalachians, Rockies 
 Mountain Tops are cold as shit, let's just see how cold I get 
 'Cause I'm going to the top, holla when you notice it 
 Boutta lotta, beatta lotta, however the sample go 
 Say I gotta oh so, what I need a sample fo 
 Got a lot of green, not enough to get a phantom though 
 Runnin' through the green like a deer or some antelope 
 Pressure's on me, but ain't nothing I can't handle though 
 Nothing I ain't seen, game sweeter than a cantaloupe 
 I'm like the villain man, they can be the good guys 
 I'm Heath Ledger, my role's much better 
 No Joker though, face like poker though 
 Furthest you've chillies been is the pochono 
 All the G's say, trigga it's your time again 
 Plus the women feel him as if they were ridin' him 
 It's the T, and then it's the R, give me a E, then Y and Songz 
 This is for free, this is no charge, do it with ease, this is not hard 
 You're killing it right (Yeah) Trey ey ey 
 Middle fingers to hatas, he killing it right (yeah) Trey ey ey 
 From VA to Jamaica, he killing it right 
 He tight (Yeah) he right (Ey) he tight (Fo Sho) 
 He killin' it right 
 He tight (Yeah) he right (Ey) he tight (Fo Sho) 
 He killin' it right 
 Belive dat 
 Ooh. Ey Ey 
 Ain't nobody dope like Songz 
 Imma let the beat go on 
 Ride the Paper Trail on home 
 Forever Imma keep my grind on 
 Ain't nobody on the shit that I'm on 
 Not that I'm on (No) 
 Either Imma go hard or go home 
 And I ain't goin' home. 
 It's the T, and then it's the R, give me a E, then Y and Songz 
 This is for free, this is no charge, do it with ease, this is not hard 
 You're killing it right (Yeah) Trey ey ey 
 Middle fingers to hatas, he killing it right (yeah) Trey ey ey 
 From VA to Jamaica, he killing it right
