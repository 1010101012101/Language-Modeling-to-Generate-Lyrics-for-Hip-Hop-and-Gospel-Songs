Shawty we been sippin on bub 
 N I done had enough 
 Let's get up out this club 
 'Cause I'm tryna get u 
 Alone alone alone 
 U alone alone alone 
 Shawty we been flirtin all night 
 N once we outside 
 Can I offer u a ride? 
 'Cause I'm tryna get u 
 Alone alone alone 
 U alone alone alone 
 Twinkle twinkle little star 
 Over there standing by the bar 
 Would you mind if I came 2 where you are? 
 Where you are? 
 When I look in ur eyes girl ur tellin' me yes 
 N when I look at the way ur booty poke outta that dress 
 Nah nah girl don't try to hide it 
 I'm on my way over there stand right beside it 
 I wanna know how you doin' 
 What's ya name 
 Girl this chemistry we share is so insane 
 Girl you know wats happenin' 
 Me n u just laughing 
 Plus my phone done died so put ur number on this napkin 
 Beautiful, Gorgeous, 
 I ain't tryna buy ur time I can't afford it 
 Wat I'm tryna do is paint a pretty portrait 
 Me n u a chariot ride with horses 
 I done came a long way 
 From white tees 'n' forces 
 N as a man I understand we can't force it 
 But if I walk you outside where the porche is 
 I'm tryna take you back home to my fortress 
 Woman take my hand 
 Tell me wats ur name 
 Girl this chemistry we share is off the chain 
 Tell me wat you think 
 U n I been laughing 
 Baby girl I'm asking 
 For a night of passion 
 All I'm thinkin' 
 How can we get 
 Alone alone alone 
 (Just u n me baby) 
 Alone alone alone 
 (Just u n I) 
 N once I get you ima kiss u 
 Ima touch you 'cause ur softer than some tissue when you leave me ima miss u 
 Gotta get you alone 
 Alone alone alone 
 I hope ur cool with that 
 Just u n I girl.
