She grew up without a father 
 Never knew how to love a man 
 She's addicted to breaking hearts and moving on 
 So I never really stood a chance 
 And a sparkle lid your eyes 
 They shine so flawless I'm amazed 
 Blinded by an angel's face 
 It's the sweetest poison in one kiss 
 And now you gotta ventil be your face 
 But even everything you lips say 
 Pretty girls lie 
 Lipstick in her smile 
 Makes you want to believe 
 But pretty girls lie 
 Pain so deep inside 
 She can't even see 
 Pretty girls lie 
 Pretty girls lie 
 Got you walking through a maze, yeah 
 Eyes closed tryin' to find your way 
 Got your mom's respond 
 Hoping she gon' make a sound 
 But she don't wanna be found 
 'Cause she'll tell you come anyway 
 And you know the difference 
 From a real lot of fake 
 Devil in the trust, but an angel in the face 
 Never ever yours but it's only for the day 
 Is it real when you calling my name 
 Pretty girls lie 
 Lipstick in her smile 
 Makes you want to believe 
 But pretty girls lie 
 Pain so deep inside 
 She can't even see 
 Pretty girls lie 
 Wanted to get a benefit out about 
 The best in how I wanna help you bring you home 
 I know something's missing inside 
 If you let me I can so improve 
 Girl it ain't no running from the truth 
 She says I'll be there 
 Girl don't just tell me what I wanna hear 
 Pretty girls lie 
 Lipstick in her smile 
 Makes you want to believe 
 But pretty girls lie 
 Pain so deep inside 
 She can't even see 
 Pretty girls lie 
 That's a pretty face and 
 She did find a way 
 That's a beautiful girl 
 Lost in the world 
 Can't trust what she says 
 After so many break-ups and make-ups in life 
 Could've been making love and end up in a fight 
 Don't tell me why 
 Pretty girls lie
