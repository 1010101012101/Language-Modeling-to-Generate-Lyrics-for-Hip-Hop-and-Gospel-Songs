(Verse One) 
 On my way 
 Oh Oh 
 Oh yeah 
 Comin' for you 
 My day done been so crazy 
 I know you been waitin' 
 But baby girl it won't be long 
 'Cause soon I'm coming home 
 Oh the phones just started ringing 
 And my boys done got to fightin' 
 Next thing you know my mama called 
 Talking 'bout her car done stalled 
 I was almost there baby 
 And the sky just got hazy 
 Then rain began to fall 
 Then Grandma start going off 
 But I swear I'm comin' baby 
 I'm so sorry to keep you waitin' 
 You just keep holding on 
 Sleet, hail or snow 
 I want you know to know 
 I'm comin' for you 
 Get that love ready 
 Hold steady 
 My lady 
 I'm comin' for you 
 Get them hugs ready 
 Hold steady 
 My lady 
 I'm comin' for you 
 (Verse Two) 
 Now the po's done pulled me over 
 But I swear girl I was sober 
 See they said I fit descriptions 
 Of a man that killed a witness 
 Ooh baby this ain't fair 
 'Cause I was almost there 
 So just keep holdin' on 
 Sleet, hail or snow 
 I want you to know 
 I'm comin' for you 
 Get that love ready 
 Hold steady 
 My lady 
 I'm comin' for you 
 Get them hugs ready 
 Hold steady 
 My lady 
 I'm comin' for you 
 (Verse Three) 
 Speedin' high as a plane 
 On this rainy road 
 I know you need me so I gotta go 
 If your lovin' was smoke 
 Then my baby's dro 
 And I need a hit so yo I gotta roll 
 And it don't matter what I gotta do 
 Get out my way 'cause see I'm on the move 
 No need to wonder who I'm comin' to 
 I'm coming for you 
 I'm comin' for you 
 Get that love ready 
 Hold steady 
 My lady 
 I'm comin' for you 
 Get them hugs ready 
 Hold steady 
 My lady 
 I'm comin' for you 
 Rain sleet hail or snow 
 I just need you know 
 That I'm coming for you 
 I'm comin' for you 
 Get that love ready 
 Hold steady 
 My lady 
 I'm comin' for you 
 Get them hugs ready 
 Hold steady 
 My lady 
 I'm comin' for you
