U know I heard a lot of remixes 
 To this song in particular 
 But this is not to be confused 
 I'm nothin' like the rest... 
 She said I'm her everythang, I'm all she ever wanted 
 Ima keep it real trick, u the best who ever done it 
 Ima give you everythang, tell me what you want, I'm on it 
 Pocket full of cheddar, I swear I can spend whatever on it 
 'Cause she hold me down, every time I hit her up 
 When I get right I promise that we gon live it up 
 She make me beg for it, till she give it up and I say 
 The samething every single time 
 U da, u da, best (repeat 3xs) 
 You the best I ever had (repeat 3xs) 
 Know you got a roommate, call me when its no one there 
 Put the key under the mate and you know I'll be over there 
 YEA I'll be over there I can send a chauffeur there 
 Miss me in the bedroom so she keep a poster there 
 Yeah from the kitchen to the sofa chair 
 Yeah we get it hotter than a toaster there 
 Yeah I beat it like an opponent I'm a winner, she be dinner 
 And I eat it like she want it (only if she want it) 
 Got my calendar, know where I'm at 
 When I'm gone we alone, no I chat 
 Send a picture to my phone 
 'Cause when I'm lookin' at my lover I don't wanna c anotha 
 Body on a milian my christina milian I can be your dream 
 If you leave it's a nightmare if you leave I be right there 
 Waitin I'm impatient so you betta make it light yeaaa 
 Trigga trey girl you know the deal 
 Lick my flow pop swallow candy rain soul for real 
 I got that heavy d, show me where your levee be 
 And I can make you overflow, for you know the levee broke 
 Oh they know I ball like spalding, so all the girls be calling 
 Don't trip tho 'cause I'm never fallin' u I wanna c when I wake up in the morning 
 Tell me what you need, I give anything you want and don't you disagree baby please 
 I know I want you and you know you want me 
 Ain't to proud to beg so I'm down on my knees 
 Never let you go 'cause you go too hard 
 Miss you like the quarterback throw too hard 
 Girl you hot enough to make the flow cool off 
 Get you wet enough you like a purple call me (?) 
 Mike phelps come through I know what you in to 
 Ima put you on when I ball like gym shoes 
 Walkin' through the mall and you all like them too 
 Throw it in the bag call me dream call me fab 
 Louie v who is he ain't nobody true as me 
 Truthfully you the only one that's gon be doin' me 
 Baby girl its u n me it ain't gon be no truency 
 Now wont you give me brain like you came straight from school for me 
 I know, I know, I know that your probably mad 
 I pushed my album back 
 I know I've done it time and time again 
 Well I'm sorry baby 
 But if you would consida to be a forgiva 
 Promise I'll deliva first day of September
