Time to kill another one (repeats) 
 I'm about what they ain't see 
 I'll be out where they can't be 
 It's easy as AB 
 They actually can't see 
 The way I ball out 
 Like they ... is carved out 
 You you guys stink like the breath from a dogs mouth 
 She's a gorgeous freak 
 She destroys my sheets 
 Indeed keep her coming back around 
 Airport police 
 The way I'm rockin' see it's like I front portch to be 
 And ye ain't fly nigga 
 The airports is cheap? 
 Everybody was sleeping 
 Now I'm living my dream 
 She said she love nda whip 
 Then I dig in her cream 
 I see you blood suckers 
 And you venomous feinds 
 I know you next type 
 Must be envious genes 
 You know I'm bout mine 
 And if you didn't know 
 What the fuck you think I'm getting hoe 
 Hater eat a *dick 
 I'm in the lyric jet? 
 The green keep growin' 
 Cha-cha-cha chia pet 
 My body's full of liquor 
 Give me some more though 
 My verses richer than richie 
 You got that poor flow 
 I'm still a skinny nigga 
 My pockets gordo 
 She's only mine for the moment 
 We know she's your hoe 
 Know what I mean nigga 
 She give dat heaad right 
 About my green nigga trigga 
 Running red lights 
 Eatin betta every day 
 But I swear I'm starving 
 R&B was just for starters so rappers I'm sorry 
 Keep the bottles coming 
 But take them sparkles off 
 Special shout to my diamonds and how they sparkle off 
 Ten acres in virginia that's my humble abode 
 But that Miami highrise for stumblin hoes 
 She's a lot of fun 
 She takes her time doing it 
 She made my body cum 
 But her mind do it 
 See I'm sicker than most 
 Let's forget what I gross 
 I've had significant growth 
 You got permission to fold 
 Hot blisterin flow 
 Competition is no 
 Baby its *uck the world 
 Got my *ick in the globe 
 Take a sip of the rose 
 Gave her Tiffany stones 
 My young money has grown 
 So she miss when I'm gone 
 I have incredible nights 
 Pray for better tomorrows 
 Love the gift that is life 
 'Cause the present is borrowed 
 I'ma live forever 
 Like my presence immortal 
 Told her to bow down 
 There's a blessin before you 
 If you didn't see 
 I'm so into me 
 Thinking back 
 That when they told me 
 What I couldn't be 
 My stars shine bright 
 But *uck the limelight 
 Just keep the bread coming 
 And keep the wine white 
 Women in model form 
 Get their baby gargle? on 
 Lifestyle fast bout to get my full throttle on 
 And I noticed this 
 People go and notice when 
 Focusin on somethin' thought provoking so I boast instead? 
 It make you wonder 
 But it's all about a loaf a bread 
 I get the picture 
 And its different since I spoke to... 
 Will's up 
 Will's down 
 Truck's outside 
 Get it up 
 I put down 
 Keep your mouth wide 
 Kill this track 
 Time to kill another one 
 Worldwide but virginias where I'm commin from 
 Mama just got a Bendz 
 Prolly get my brother one 
 Two freaks here 
 But I want another one 
 Boy fresher than tuxedos with the... 
 Boy I'm hot shit 
 Like a toilet in the sun 
 One one me 
 Never be another one 
 Cougars on the prowl 
 I can make your mother cum
