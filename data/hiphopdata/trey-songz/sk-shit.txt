If it ain't stuck in yo head then imma beat it in runnin' through the green 
 Like my Last name peterson thomasin ladanian bitch this is my stadium 
 If they say defeat while in my leather seats I'm suede'n 'em I fucked up 
 (Repeat) 
 Ballin in the game like a player that's created and three dikes and I'm fadin' em 
 Rap unleashin' demons yet I sing like I'm arcadian 
 Realest nigga livin' walk in a badd bitch and her body fake as shit 
 Super-Cali-Fragil-Istic-Expi-Ali-Docious think I might just call yo chick and say I want my toes kissed 
 Tell yo baby momma I will pay to get her nose fixed her breast too A B C D E F you I'm special 
 The best and you are errthing that's left of that 
 I'm gone take it all while you get whatever's left of that 
 I'm next at bat so throw that shit I'm cold as shit you bogus bitch you know this shit is over with 
 Matter who you go and get all you niggas slow as shit 
 I turn these women on like my name was motecontroller bitch 
 Jumpin' on this track such a locust diss the money shoutin' haters outta focus 
 Pussy niggas need to change their gender boy I'm colder than December 
 Your nothin' to forget and I am somethin' to remember 
 Eatin' this fuckin' track like there were nothin' here for dinner 
 Attentions what we all want I am in the center and its rightful I'm spiteful 
 I found out who you wife'd fool that's just to get up in her 
 Say they the shit but I run the sewer I'm master splinter 
 I only want for bitch niggas to exit when I enter 
 You see I am a major crash you just a finder bender 
 No contenders you so limber see I'm stiffted and my mistress is this rap shit 
 I came in with my main bitch we live in peace and harmony 
 But this rap hoe flow so cold I swear it's like she callin me 
 Fuck the way you thought of me I'm nothin' like you thought I'd be that's even if you follow me 
 Appreciative you oughta be cannot what you want of me 
 I'm mostly in the A that's if you wannabe's wanna see 
 I don't respect authority you can catch me overseas 
 Pretty women notice me and fall like some autumn leaves 
 Guess they think alot of me everything you oughta be 
 My money is a part of me so fuck you and your policies 
 Sometimes I get the feelin' I am the peoples property 
 Life is crazy complicated then I smoke alot of weed drink alot of 
 Liquor have alot of sex addictive lifestyle it'll prolly be the death of me 
 Hope my momma never hear this shit and then think less of me 
 You don't know how this pressure be I guess I got some stress in me 
 Times I wanna spaz show the world the kanye west in me 
 But fuck it imma star the American dream like we not out and tdot smoking Canadian green 
 I'm higher than aladdin and his arabian queen carpet in the sky told you I was fly 
 Came to knock 'em down so I love the way they lie 
 I run this enterprise got a complicated mind and I dumb it down for you stupid niggas every time 
 I'm sicker every line they wish that I decline but I stay on the grind baby bad brakes 
 Haters I'm the shit won't you tell me how my ass taste 
 Ricky Bobby daddy say if you ain't first you last place 
 Movin' at a fast pace you niggas is butts call 'em ash trays 
 Wanna be the mothafuckin' man you can ask Trey 
 Murder in the first my accomplice is SK on the track man we killt this shit
