I'm coming through to meet you, 
 Girl I can't wait to see ya, 
 Just stepped up out of Magic, 
 I'm feeling like an addict, 
 He need a little touch up, 
 To help 'em go to sleep, 
 Sugar I'm about to pull up, 
 Buzz the gate for me, 
 I step out through the door, 
 Stumbling from all the sippin', 
 I pull you to the floor, 
 You hot from all the kissin', 
 Oh I know you wit it, 
 So let's take it slow, 
 I bought you a ticket baby, 
 I'm gon do a show 
 Baby you the juice, 
 Watch me be the Gin, 
 Beat it like a nigga who just got up out tthe pin, 
 From the floor to kitchen, 
 Kitchen to the bathroom, 
 Bathroom to the shower, 
 Take a break and bring back in a hour 
 I'm in my zone tonight, 
 I'm feelin' all right, 
 I got this wine in me, 
 I got that weed in me, 
 Oh girl I'm feelin' like a soldier, 
 Gon and do it rough, 
 I know you like it when I hold ya, 
 Girl I want to oh, 
 Make it rain tonight, 
 And I ain't talkin' 'bout no money girl, 
 Imma make it rain tonight, 
 And I ain't quitin' till I get it right, 
 Now baby stand up, 
 Put yo hands against the wall, 
 While I kiss down your spine, 
 I'm sure you know where I go from here, 
 And I know you feel, 
 When I'm kissin', 
 In your kitten, 
 And I know you don't be trippin', 
 When I step inside your love, 
 Oh that's what I'll do, 
 I just wanna love, 
 The closer I get to you, 
 I said it keeps on better, 
 And I love when we're together, oh-oh 
 Baby you the juice, 
 Watch me be the Gin, 
 Beat like a nigga that just got up out the pin, 
 From the floor to the kitchen, 
 Kitchen to the bathroom, 
 Bathroom to the shower, 
 Take a break and bring it back in a hour 
 I'm in my zone tonight,

 I got this wine in me, 
 I got that weed in me, 
 Oh, girl I'm feelin' like a soldier, 
 Gon and do it rough,
