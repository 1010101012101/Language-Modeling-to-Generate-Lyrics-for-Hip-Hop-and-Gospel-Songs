I mean no disrespect when I get my fresh 
 Yeah 
 Let go 
 I'm in my polo tank top, hold up 
 Am I supposed to start right here 
 (Trey laugh) aye, why my blackberry keep blinkin' like that 
 Aye check it... for me 
 Wrap up ya weave or ya real hair 
 And when you lay down to dream I be in it like I live there (yup) 
 Listen to my songz (aye) 
 Before you pass out (come on) 
 And all night long, I bang ya ass out 
 Dig it dig it dig it like ya shoveling dirt (dirt) 
 Playin' with the kitten while you liftin' up ya shirt (shirt) 
 Baby let me lick on dat nipple (yeah) 
 Ha ha ha that tickle (ha ha) 
 Bout to bust a bomb off turn that damn alarm off 
 Touchin' you, huggin' you, lovin' you, when I'm when I'm up in you cuttin' you why would you wanna wake up 
 If I was in your dream why would you wanna wake up? 
 If I was in your dream why would you wanna wake up? 
 (Second verse) 
 (If) if I touched up on ya booty 
 (If) if I kissed you while ya do me 
 (If) we make love like it's a movie 
 (Dream) if you wake up you wanna sue me 
 I'm the, I'm the (best), the best the best you never had 
 Be lightin' that ass like we out in baghdad 
 Girl let me grab this mask (magnum!) 
 I'm playin' dumb you already know I'm stupid 
 When it comes to the juices 
 I get it goin' flowin and you can call me niel river (river) 
 Jump up on ya beat now it's on by a river (river) 
 Go guerrilla trigga internet killa (killa) 
 Out my mind it's my time like milla 
 I be ya dream lover, say I talk about sex to much 
 But, that's 'cause I have sex so much 
 Next to us is nobody 
 No nigga, no shawty 
 You got a cold body so jump on that pole for me 
 I be goin' deep then you be countin' sheep in 
 While yo ass sleepin', he jump off the deep end (what) 
 Suicide it's a suicide (whoa) 
 Slit his wrist when I hit his chick (yup) 
 Man how sick is this 
 I forget the chick name on the plane 
 'Cause her number won't say 
 All I think of is trey (trey) 
 August 4th is the day 
 I can't remember you baby (no) 
 If I'm in ya dream and you wake up you crazy 
 Touchin' you, huggin' you, lovin' you, when I'm when I'm up in you cuttin' you why would you wanna wake up 
 If I was in your dream why would you wanna wake up? 
 If I was in your dream why would you wanna wake up?
