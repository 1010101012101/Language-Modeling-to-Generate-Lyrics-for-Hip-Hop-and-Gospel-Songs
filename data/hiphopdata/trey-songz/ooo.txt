 In the clubs showing love in them 
 Candy apple bottoms like ooh

 Pourin some ooh in your cup 
 Blowin' that ooh in the air 
 Ooh let me take you there 
 'Cause imma hit you like ooh

 Backseat of the jeep on a late night creep 
 Like ooh 
 First time in the club when you getting some love 
 Shawty backing it up like ooh 
 It's like rolling one up 
 Real girls getting down and you throwing it up 
 It's like getting your girl in the v.i.p. 
 First time with a fake i.d. 
 Let me hit you like ooh

 On the flo' gettin' closer

 See if we ooh like we came to

 She bout to ooh all over herself 
 I had to say ooh girl get control of yourself 
 She felt that ooh 
 When we bump and grind 
 See everything bout ooh is so fine

 Pourin some ooh in your cup 
 Blowin' that ooh in the air

 Backseat of the jeep on a late night creep
