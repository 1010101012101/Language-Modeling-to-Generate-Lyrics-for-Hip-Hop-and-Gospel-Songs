(Intro - Trey Songz) 
 Track's so phenominal I'm 'bout to spit venom 
 I'd like to thank Phenom 
 Yeah 
 (Verse 1 - Trey Songz) 
 You see I'm something like a player 
 But mamma may I 
 Get down on my knees 
 And say a prayer 
 'Cause your body's a blessing 
 Yeah I love it I want it I need it 
 And I ain't happy till I hit it and get it succeed it 
 You know I'm hungry as a mother fucker 
 What'd you feed him 
 I'm on a bad bitch diet 
 You niggas should try it 
 Higher than a pilot 
 Tryna see how high the sky 
 Get whoever said the sky is the limit's on some lie shit 
 'Cause I'm looking down at it 
 You looking ass backwards 
 Everything I have is everything that he is lacking 
 Baby you are so attractive 
 You the baddest 
 All I wanna know is can I may I have it 
 Mamma may I 
 Can I bite off all the peas 
 You look edible to me 
 I'd like to have you with my coffee, sugar 
 Mama can I call you Billie Jean 
 'Cause the girl is not my lover but my love is what she needs 
 May I 
 Show you what you missing 
 May I 
 Girl I know you different 
 You got me thinking saying baby may I 
 May I... 
 Verse 2 - Fabolous: 
 Now I tried to ask politely 
 'Cause they love when I say nice 
 But that nice shit don't excite me 
 She say pull it she say bite me she say grab it hold it tightly 
 And so rightly I be tryna tear that mother fucker up 
 Give it to you rough still be the smoothed around 
 Feed you Ciroc till the moon start moving 'em round 
 You wanna act like a nun I'ma prove that you down 
 The nuns be them ones you seen that movie The Town 
 So may I take a couple steps forward 
 If the bad bitches had a crew you would rep for it 
 You could give me top quiz girl I'm prepped for it 
 When them other chicks died baby girl just kept going 
 Dat's that Energizer bunny put my face in it I be Pooh Bear for you honey 
 Them niggas are a joke I told her don't be fucking funny 
 And the kush clouds got the room looking partly sunny 
 Verse 3 - Trey Songz: 
 Yeah they say I'm rapping like Wayne, Jay and Kanye 
 Where's Amber Rose told them I don't know they 
 So mind your fucking business I know Trey does 
 But I would still hit it shit nigga Kanye shrug 
 Gotta hit a gaylor but my tux don't fit me 
 Told my style is get it Taylor baby do it swiftly 
 Puerto Rican Rum out in Jamaica feeling tipsy 
 She know I'm doing well I make a fortune so she tell her friends gypsy 
 Pockets on catch me if you can come and get me 
 Bitch this is my moment you can catch me on demand 
 If you missed me from Japan back to Whiff Street 
 Any place I wanna go what the f0ck 
 AKA for envelope it's Trigga 'n' that's the way your woman lick me 
 Life is but a dream man somebody come and pinch me 
 I am such a feen this rap shit is so addictive 
 I ain't even gotta say why it's over though may I 
 May I may I
