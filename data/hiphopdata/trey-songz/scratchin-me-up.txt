When we hop up in tha bed 
 You knw what it is 
 You gone be on me 
 I'm gone be on you 
 And it feel so good, I gotta have it 
 Don't it so good, way you be grabbin 
 Tha sheets, tha pillows, tha dresser, tha covers, tha mattress 
 Passion makin' love, girl you scratchin me up 
 But its cool (I love it) 
 'Cause I love when we touchin (I love it) 
 I love when we kissin' (I love it) 
 Sexin you be scratchin me up 
 Pose for tha camera while it flash 
 Take pictures while kiss, I grab yo ass 
 Nasty love, passionate, give it up 
 From beginning to tha end, tha way we get it in 
 Can't another couple compete, when we in tha sheets 
 Breakfast in bed, love tha way I eat 
 I love tha way it be, we a couple freaks 
 Rockin' to tha rhythm, and tha rhythm of tha beat 
 Its yo body, on my body 
 Clap clap clap from tha back back back 
 Smack smack smack when I act like that 
 She react right back, pullin on 
 Tha sheets, tha pillows, tha dresser, tha covers, tha mattress 
 Passion makin' love, girl you scratchin me up 
 But its cool (I love it) 
 'Cause I love when we touchin (I love it) 
 I love when we kissin' (I love it) 
 Sexin you be scratchin me up (then I go a lil deeper) 
 Sexin you be scratchin me up (then she scratch a lil harder) 
 Oh girl you scratchin me up 
 But its cool (I love it), 'cause I love when we touchin (I love it) 
 I love when kissin' (I love it)

 Second round (yuuup) 
 Oh I love your body on mine 
 Grinding so I wanna take my time 
 Baby put it on me

 Lovin' on full, goin' till its one 
 Scream so loud we gone need our own street 
 Can't another couple compete, when we in tha sheets 
 Breakfast in bed, love tha way I eat 
 I love tha way it be, we a couple freaks 
 Rockin' to tha rhythm, and tha rhythm of tha beat 
 Its yo body, on my body 
 Clap clap clap from tha back back back 
 Smack smack smack when I act like that 
 She react right back, pullin on 
 Tha sheets, tha pillows, tha dresser, tha covers, tha mattress (tha mattress) 
 Passion makin' love, girl you scratchin me up 
 But its cool (I love it) 
 'Cause I love when we touchin (I love it) 
 I love when we kissin' (I love it)
