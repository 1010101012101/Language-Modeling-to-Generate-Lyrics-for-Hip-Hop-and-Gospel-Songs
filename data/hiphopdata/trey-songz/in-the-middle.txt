(Ummmm no) 
 If I could be up in the middle of 
 Just wanna be in the middle of 
 Middle of your love 
 If I could be, anywhere in the world I would be 
 Inside your skirt in you gurl between your knees 
 Everyday of my life, my life, my life 
 I just want, to make your body really want to get it on 
 We could turn the bed into a stage and then perform 
 Your body's gettin' hot gurl I could feel its warm 
 I show you what I'll do 
 (Chorus Repeat 1X) 
 If I could be up in the middle of 
 (Middle of your love) 
 Givin' you a little uh 
 (Like a cup, I'll fill you up) 
 Just wanna be in the middle of 
 (The middle of your love) 
 Your love, love, love, love 
 If I coule be, believe me gurl I would be your fantasy 
 I'll make you come right were you'll be on top of me 
 So can we get that close, where I could feel your body sweat 
 Tryin' to make yo body wet 
 Can we, climb the mountain top screamin' ecstacy 
 We so high up on this love, we done reached the peak 
 We ain't never coming down, baby keep makin' that sound 
 (If I could just be) 
 (Chorus Repeat 1X) 
 It' s got me open, willin', and ready 
 Baby I'm open, listen up and here me 
 I'm not tryin' to be in the front or the back, by the side, 
 Just inside, deep inside, the middle of your love 
 Whoa! 
 Uh 
 (Let me inside, Let me in, let me in the middle!) 
 (Chorus Repeat 2X)
