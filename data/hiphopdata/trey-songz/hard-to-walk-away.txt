I love everything about your body 
 Open up inside, you know 
 You know that I'mma make you love me 
 If we do this one more time 
 'Cause girl eventually my face gonna get sticky tonight 
 And I go down on it, I go to town on it 
 Don't I, don't I, don't I give you more than you can take? 
 And we ain't 'bout to stop, no 
 Girl, who needs a break? 
 Oh it's never good, take your body shake 
 And if you ever try to leave me, girl 
 I'mma make it hard, hard to walk away 
 Promise you gon' feel me later 
 It's gon' be hard, hard to walk away 
 Feel it in your body all day 
 Hard, I'll make it hard to walk away 
 Stay in bed, rest the head, take it easy 
 It's gon' be the best day 
 You gon' want a round away you'll see 
 Especially if you tryina feel me later 
 Girl, your face so pretty, my face gonna get sticky tonight 
 And I go down on it, I go to town on it 
 Don't I, don't I, don't I give you more than you can take? 
 And we ain't 'bout to stop, no! 
 Girl, who needs a break?! 
 This girl ain't never over, make your body shake 
 (Make it shake for me) 
 And if you ever try to leave me, girl

 I won't let no problems getting up in the morning 
 But you'll startin' too young and 
 Girl, you know I kill, kill, kill, kill that

 Poppin' like a pill that 
 That's so fine, hell yeah 
 You gon' kiss it till ya 
 Gon' hear me say don't I give you more than you can take? 
 And we ain't 'bout to stop, no 
 Girl, who needs a break?

 And if you ever try to leave me, girl 
 I'mma make it hard, hard to walk away 
 Promise you gon' feel me later 
 It's gon' be hard, hard to walk away 
 Felatin' your body all day 
 Hard, I'll make it hard to walk away
