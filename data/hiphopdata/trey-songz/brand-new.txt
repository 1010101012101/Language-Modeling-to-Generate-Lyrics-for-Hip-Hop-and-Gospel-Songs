 Shawty brand new (brand new) fresh out the box (fresh out the box) 
 Tonight I'm gon' be yo' husband 
 S-s-s-s-soon as girl step up in the club 
 All the fellas tryna hard to say what's up 
 But, me I play it cool, just like chess I know the rules 
 And, I bet I checkmate her in like 4 moves

 And, sh-sh-she drink it straight, 'cause she like it strong 
 G-G-G-Girl I wanna leave with you so we can get it on

 S-S-She sippin' on that liquor, I'm tryna get her to the house 
 G-G-Girl let's just tear our clothes off, let's just tear our clothes off 
 S-She said she brand new I'm tryna see what that's ab-bou-bou-bou-bou-bou-bout 
 She said she ain't even looking for a dude 
 But, if you with a winner then you know you can't lose (And It-it's) 
 A-A-A-All red on the bottom of ya' shoes 
 So, I already know you gotta have loot 
 A-Ain't got a lot of time so I won't spend it 
 Talkin' like these lame niggas paper that they ain't spending 
 Can you dig it, girl I wanna leave with you so we can get it on 
 Is this is the last call and this is the last song
