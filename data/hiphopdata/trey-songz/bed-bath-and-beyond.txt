Hey ms feisty what's your name 
 If you ain't got a deadline maybe we can hang 
 Oh lets talk, I'm loving that swag 
 Hair so long it comes down to your ass 
 Ooh baby I was leaving but damn that dress 
 Lookin' so pricey but yet priceless 
 Yeah baby ima follow, tell me where to go 
 In my navigation shawty lets roll 
 U know the destination, tell me where to be 
 Touching on your hair, down to your feet 
 Down to the bed, into the bath and beyond 
 All you gotta do is ask 
 Ooh baby ima take you to all the places you admire 
 I could go low and make you go higher 
 I can't let you go baby I tried to 
 I just wanna let you know 
 We can take it to the bed 
 We can take it to the bath 
 Girl we can go beyond 
 All you gotta do is ask 
 Hey ms feisty what's your game 
 Baby put me in 'cause I really wanna play 
 Wanna post up low then take it to the hole 
 I play all positions, u already know 
 We can go the distance 'bout a hundred miles 
 Start off real fast then slow it on down 
 Take it to the bed then to the bath and beyond 
 All you gotta do is ask 
 Ooh baby ima take you to all the places you admire 
 I could go low and make you go higher 
 I can't let you go baby I tried to 
 I just wanna let you know 
 We can take it to the bed 
 We can take it to the bath 
 Girl we can go beyond 
 All you gotta do is ask 
 Girl if you wanna go beyond this world 
 Grab my hand and get behind me girl 
 Get you wetta then a bubble bath 
 All you gotta do is ask 
 (Repeat) 
 Ooh baby ima take you to all the places you admire 
 I could go low and make you go higher 
 I can't let you go baby I tried to 
 I just wanna let you know 
 We can take it to the bed 
 We can take it to the bath 
 Girl we can go beyond 
 All you gotta do is ask 
 (Repeat until end of song...)
