I juss wanna let you know that I appreciate ya 
 In every single way that I can 
 And lady there's no one, there's no one like you, you 
 To make me wanna go out my way 
 And make sure every day is your special day 
 And if there is anything you need 
 (I will give it to you) 
 And if there is anything you want 
 (I will give it to you) 
 And if there is anything you ask 
 (I will give it to you) 
 Yes I do (I will give it to you) 
 'Cause if there is anything you need 
 (I will give it to you) 
 If there is anything you want 
 (I will give it to you) 
 If there is anything you ask 
 (I'll give it to you baby) 
 Yes I will 
 Flowers on your birthday 
 Diamonds every anniversary 
 We'll go see a movie every Friday 
 ('Cause it's the little thigs that count) 
 Cruises every Valentine 
 I'll do anything to keep you mine 
 And to show that my love is real, for you 
 If when the time is right to settle down 
 And all is? 
 You're gonna be the one 
 I put this on my life 
 Just because you down for me 
 There's nothing I won't do 
 And if it's money that you need 
 (I will give it to you) 
 And if it's kisses that you want 
 (I will give it you) 
 Girl if it's lovin' that you need 
 (I will give it to you) 
 Don't be afraid to come to me 
 (I will give it to you)
