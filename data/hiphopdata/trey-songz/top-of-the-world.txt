Money on my mind so these haters in the way 
 Havin' conversation with that paper every day 
 I ain't talkin' short bread, girl, I'm with that major cake 
 Plus I spend it, I can't take it when the Lord take me away 
 With my lighter, with my lighter, aye CiCi, fill my drink up 
 Ain't no purple, ain't no pink up in this red cup but I'm fucked up 
 Starin' at your body, goddamn your sexy body 
 I'm Trey, I came to play, I wanna use you as my hobby, girl 
 Seen so many faces in these unfamiliar cities 
 Bright skyline's got a nigga kinda dizzy 
 They tryin' to take my spot, well, they gon' have to come and get me 
 My crib is at the top, anybody rollin' with me 
 If I could I would bring the whole hood to the top of the world with me 
 Here's my world for free, tryin' to give what you came to see, yeah 
 If I could I would bring the whole hood to the top of the world with me 
 Here's my world for free, tryin' to give what you came to see, yeah 
 You say you're workin' harder then I swear that you're a liar 
 They swear they hot as me but they ain't never felt the fire 
 If you're talkin' money, boy, you preachin' to the choir 
 And I be in her brain, she can't think of nothin' flyer 
 For my niggas in the hood, lookin' at these other niggas 
 Like I wish a nigga would, 'cause it ain't all good if I could I would 
 Reach out my hand to everybody that's sufferin' 
 Push you down, get up again, play by my rules so fuck the plan 
 It's money on my mind, so these haters in the way 
 Havin' conversations with that paper every day 
 I ain't talkin' short bread, girl, I'm with that major cake 
 Plus I spend it, I can't take it when the Lord take me away 
 If I could I would bring the whole hood to the top of the world with me 
 Here's my world for free, tryin' to give what you came to see, yeah 
 If I could I would bring the whole hood to the top of the world with me 
 Here's my world for free, tryin' to give what you came to see, yeah 
 Lately I'm smokin' more 
 Do it for Virginia every time 
 Lately I'm smokin' more but still I'm focused more 
 I live the day, can't see tomorrow, I don't know for sure 
 You who I wrote this for, oh yeah, you dope fo' sho' 
 Oh yeah, you're raw so get it cookin', let 'em know you pure, oh 
 I pray for this so I'm made for this 
 These niggas just potholes in the road that I paved for this 
 Obama tryin' to turn this motherfucker 'round 
 And look, they're tryin' to put that motherfucker down 
 Women, please check for somethin' more than stilettos 
 And young girls, make these low niggas respect you 
 If I was your father I'd never neglect you 
 So a nigga like me probably never met you 
 Probably somethin' special and I'm happy I met you 
 But you really wan' know me I just wan' sex you 
 After you wanna cuddle, I don't want but I let you 
 You made me promise and I'm honest, try not to forget you 
 Bond growin' stronger with the brothers that look up to me 
 It's more important than whatever that they fuck with me 
 Luckily, my angel speak to God like, what's up for me 
 My heart beat for the people who carry the love for me 
 Left my feelings in the past, you can't get in touch with me 
 If he want it, I give him cash, I do it reluctantly 
 But that's my nigga, I'ma put him back up on his feet 
 And if he fall he could still come right back to me 
 Wish I could take everybody, nigga 
 Everybody can't go though, doing my best 
 Everybody can't go, I'm a take who I can 
 Only if I could
