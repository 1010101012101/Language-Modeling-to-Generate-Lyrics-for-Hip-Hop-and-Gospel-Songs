Its 5 o clock in the morning and the rising sun wakes me 
 I'm Laying in a bed with a girl that don't belong to me 
 And she Whispers Come on my Darling lets go Round Two 
 Then she gon start to kissing me and to her surpise I quickly move 
 Now she got this dumb look on her face like what had she Done 
 How could she be so stupid as to think that she the One 
 Must of lost Her Fucking Mind 
 But Damn this Girl was Fine 
 From the club went to her Home 
 She didn't want to be Alone 
 Here I am Trickin while my girlie's at Home 
 Gotta find my car keys so I can get on up out the door 
 She stood there mind was wondering 
 How he gon leave that way? 
 Looked at me like I was Crazy 
 Then I got up and Walked Away 
 Man I gotta wife at Home, and to lose her OH I'm Scared 
 So now I'm on my Way home, Whiping off this other womans Hair 
 Shhh shh Silent... nervous as hell while I'm Driving 
 Can't make a sound, 'cause I know I'm going Down 
 What ima say when she ask me where I been though? 
 Fell Asleep and smoking to much indo 
 Think... think ...she gon know a nigga lying 
 So I copped me some Febreeze and then I sprayed around 
 Then I walked my crazy ass up in the house 
 And I walked in and yelled I'm Home 
 She said honey I'm in the room 
 I walked in there with a smile on my Face, and said honey I Been missing you 
 She hopped all over me and Said that she cooked and ran my Bath WAter 
 I'm telling you now I ain't smell no food, but that bitch deserved an Oscar 
 Threw her in the bed and start to snatching her clothes off 
 Thinking to my Self Trey Songs YOu G You pulled it Off 
 Ain't gon believe it but things get deeper as the story goes on 
 We touching, kissing, Baby Listen... That ain't Yo Phone. 
 You Should of Seen the Look that I had on my Face 
 She tryed to hold me back but hell it was to late 
 I hopped up and said there's a mystery going on and I'm gonna solve it 
 And I'm like, God please don't let no Man be in my Partment 
 I walked in the Bath Room, Looked Behind the Door 
 She said baby come back to me, and I said Bitch say no More 
 I pull back the shower curtains and she's biting her nails 
 Then I walk back to the room, right now I'm sweating like hell 
 Check under the bed, then under the dresser 
 I look at the closet, get my gat out the dresser 
 I look back at the closet, get closer to the closet 
 Now I'm at the Closet, Now I'm opening the Closet and then I fuck the man in the closet and she says wat the hell and I said bitch you must didn't know this my new nigga and your out you fish pussy hoe!
