Monster motherfucka you know I've been one of them niggas so shady cause you know I been sunning them. 
 (Repeats) 
 Irrational methods 
 I will trashing you in seconds 
 Wait until your spirit rises 
 Then ask for your blessing 
 I'm insane I'm deranged boncker blanka 
 Nigger you should know 
 That I'm a mother fucker monster I'm so demented, it's cemented in my brain 
 Every pretty women world wide supposed to give me brain 
 Till I squirt soft, damn where the jerk off 
 First off, fuck y'all 
 Haters on the balls of a better man 
 Pause then behead a man 
 Eat your ass alive 
 Murder the other guys while your ass is digesting in 
 I'm wondering, should I put 'em asunder then 
 Begin with the plundering, devour every one of them 
 And I ain't talking to no particular one of them 
 But if a nigga want it then 
 Bring 'em I'm a done 'em in 
 Come again, I'ma make more money than I can ever spend in 
 If you got a girl, better lock her in 
 'Cause the one that's with me now in the telly 
 Got some dumb nigga named 'Twan on her belly [haha] 
 Lets discuss this, I am not to be fucked with 
 Have no fear, so I see no peers 
 I'm so far gone, they don't see me here 
 Plus I'm so far grown but you see no beard [yeah] 
 Murder game, slit shit from ear to ear 
 Breaking women's heart when I tell 'em what they never hear 
 After tonight from me, you may never ever hear 
 I leave you feinding while releasing my demons and nemons 
 Marcus, I'm gorgeous, I'm flawless, applaud it 
 White folk looking, can't believe a nigga bought this 
 If only they could see how quickly I will abort shit 
 Done once I wash shit once, that's no horse shit 
 Fresh as a mint mouth, penthouse, top floor shit 
 Mr. Steal-yo-girl and I probably got your bitch 
 Where she at, nigga look around 
 Even if she with you now, bet I probably took her down [uh] 
 Mon-store, a lyrical gun store 
 Got all the ammunition a killer could want for 
 And I want more, you can call me carnivore 
 Pretty picture, pretty trigga 
 Eating every one of y'all
