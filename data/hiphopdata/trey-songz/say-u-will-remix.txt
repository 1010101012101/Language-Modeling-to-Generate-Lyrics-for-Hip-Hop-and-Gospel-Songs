Chicka Awn, Songz! 
 Yup! 
 We was so official 
 See the tears to my tissue? 
 On my shoulder was the tissue full of tears [ ? ] 
 I told her my fears, 
 She told me her fears 
 She said, she'd do whatever so we'd make through the year 
 So, why's the moment here when we not together? 
 Thought we s?pose to be forever 
 Sick to my stomach 
 Wanna vomit and I'm bummin 
 I ain't gotta hair cut in bouta month and I be frontin 
 When you callin in the mornin, like you want it 
 But, you don't 
 You just be frontin 
 Why you frontin? 
 I'm abusin my substance 
 Doin' a lotta puffin 
 Doin' a lotta cussin 
 Talkin' to myself like, ?Trigga, what happened?? 
 Yellin' one minute, next minute I'm laughin'! 
 Next minute, I'm cryin, next minute, I'm dyin' 
 Pass me the aspirin 
 Start to buck it all back then 
 Look at the sky like, ?Lord,? 
 (What you askin?) 
 ?Why'd you take her ?way from me? 
 Why'd she had to go? 
 Father, this is sudden, I only wanna know? 
 Was ?posed to plant my seed in her 
 We was ?posed to grow 
 Is it what she said, or anotha nigga, tho? 
 Ain't nobody, can't nobody else be wit my baby 
 See her wit anotha man, I'll probably go crazy 
 Shit, I'm crazy 
 I'd kill him if I seen him 
 How I'm feelin' 
 I ain't playin' 
 I am playin' 
 Gettin' my Kayne in 
 Baby, this is Trey and everyday they in a weigh-in 
 They be sayin', 
 Ion't be slayin these beats so maliciously 
 Tell me why you dissin me 
 I try to leave the mic alone 
 She called and said she misses me 
 I came back 
 Now, ain't that sweet of me to be, givin' her what she need? 
 All day it's VA, to The Bay, the NY, To LA 
 I been fly 
 I been past guys in the rearview 
 Aye, lookie here you 
 Ion't care what my peers do 
 It's al lotta yous like seal food 
 So many fish in the sea 
 Only one me 
 Only one Songz 
 Ain't no one song, I won't jump on, and get my thump on 
 Beat the track up like it jumped on my momma and that's on my momma 
 And, ain't to rhymer, 
 Ain't no singer, 
 Ain't no human, 
 Ain't no creature, 
 That can fill my sneakers 
 I sound so good through the twitters 
 I smell so hood from the reefer 
 Yet, I'm tryna change my imagery 
 But, I'm still real, I ain't never been gimmicky 
 Said, I'm great now 
 But, imagine what I'm finna be 
 I'm filled wit flattery every time they mimic me 
 Aye 
 I'm at the top of my game 
 And ain't nobody poppin' my chain 
 Ion't even where one but, the Goons gon? bang if you reach for any mothafuckin thing 
 It's Tremaine 
 Nunnnnh 
 Nunnnnh 
 Nuh 
 Kayne gon? sang 
 So, I?ma gon? rap a lil bit 
 Ya know? 
 Ion't give a fuck how you feel about it eitha 
 Bet that 
 Ya know, I was 23 a couple days ago? 
 MJing it 
 I guess now I?ma get my Kobe on 
 Too forward 
 Still I'm in the zone, don't get that confused 
 I see you seeing me 
 I was in Petersburg for a couple days, gave away a couple turkeys 
 Went to DC, shut that down Friday night, 
 Saturday went to Baltimore and shut that down 
 Sunday I'm in the A, Red Velvet Room 
 Now, I'm in the Crib, getting back at it 
 What it do?
