 And Sammie 
 (Verse 1: Trey Songz) 
 Very lil make up on, baby so flawless 
 I just wanna wake up on ha body in the morning 
 My tender own ringbone 
 So I know when she calling (she's my only love) 
 Shawty got an ass so fat 
 I love to jump on it 
 But she ain't, she ain't, she ain't my, me and her do it big 
 What it is, six speed to seats to the crib 
 And I'm feeling on her thigh rite now 
 And the ceiling is the sky rite now 
 Let's, she's working those shoes 
 I purchased dem lambs and she keeps 'em on 
 While we get our secret on yeah, she gets it in 
 Yeah, we get it in, only on the weekends 
 'Cause she ain't my girl, she ain't my girl, she ain't my girl, she ain't my girl 
 I be playing with her body 
 She be playing with my mind 
 All the time cause her man ain't home 
 She ain't my girl, she ain't my girl, she ain't my girl 
 Gotta pretty lil shawty 
 And I'm feeling on her body 
 Every time her man be gone 
 (Verse 2: Sammie) 
 You ain't the only, only 
 I've been there before 
 The way she be groaning, moaning 
 I don't wanna let her go 
 We be getting all nasty like 
 She said her man don't been doing it right 
 So she holds me closely 
 Damn she fixes my appetite 
 I eat it up 
 Mmmm mmm mmm good 
 Her loving is so damn good 
 I can't front she know exactly what I want 
 But it's only when her man ain't home 
 'Cause she ain't my girl, she ain't my girl, she ain't my girl, she ain't my girl 
 I be playing with her body 
 She be playing with my mind 
 All the time cause her man at home 
 She ain't my girl, she ain't my girl, she ain't my girl, she ain't my girl 
 Gotta pretty lil shawty 
 And I'm feeling on her body 
 Every time her man be gone 
 (Bridge: Trey Songz and Sammie) 
 Trey Songz: 
 I love to be up under that 
 She keeps me coming back 
 All up in the sack 
 Like a quarterback 
 Then we run it back 
 Like a running back 
 And every time she leaves, 
 She makes me want her back
