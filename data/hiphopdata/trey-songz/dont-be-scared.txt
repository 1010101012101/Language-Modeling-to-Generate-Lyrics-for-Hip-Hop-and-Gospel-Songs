 Don't you be scared

 Don't you be, don't you be scared 
 Body's like jumped off out the page 
 I can't get out of here 
 Plus you got a beautiful face 
 Let's go somewhere and disappear 
 Said she like to smoke, I do too 
 Said she like to drink, I do too 
 So what you think have a little conversation 
 What's on your mind tell me what you been thinking 
 I'ma keep it real alot of women in my phone 
 But I'ma be for real you the only one I want 
 I ain't telling lies like I'm tryin' to settle down 
 You probably heard I get around 
 Don't you be scared, 
 Girl don't you be scared of lovin' 
 No matter what they say, 'bout 'em 'bout 'em 
 Don't you be scared, no matter what your homegirl playin' 
 You probably make your own bed since

 I ain't talking 'bout no watch 
 Can't call you no dime 
 I know you can't be bought

 All these fucking blinds 
 Talking about what they got

 But I'ma be for real you the only one I want

 Don't be scared 
 Presidential sweets, and these foul blows 
 Living up and live doing what you do 
 Hanging on and each of every moves 
 Detectives on my trail but don't have a clue 
 All I want is bad, bad mercedes benz and millions 
 That's on the air rich 
 I'm ballin' with my lil homies we smoking levish 
 Versace shirts I remember we didn't have this 
 How I look now all gold spinners, denim swarming foes 
 Stacking money taller than my shawty low 
 I'm dropping classes people nothing shard go and go 
 Don't you be scared of me baby 'cause all I do is ball 
 Don't you be scared, 
 Girl don't you be scared of lovin' 
 No matter what they say, 'bout 'em 'bout 'em

 You grown make your own decisions
