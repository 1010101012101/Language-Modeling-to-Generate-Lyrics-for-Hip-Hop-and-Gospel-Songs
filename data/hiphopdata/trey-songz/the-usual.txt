 How 'bout we just pull over, And just do it where we at 
 How 'bout you just lift that skirt up 
 Oh ... We can be bad 
 That place that ain't been touched, I'm feeling on it 
 I'll let you sit through, keep spinning on it 
 Girl ... Giddy Up Giddy Up, Take me on a ride to ecstasy 
 You don't wanna bump bump then take a nap 
 You just wanna bump bump bring right back 
 Watch me

 You gon' feel something unusual, unusual, unusual 
 I'm not gon' do what the usual, 
 Not your regular, Tell you what, Let me touch 
 You gon' feel something unusual 
 I wanna do the wicked things you never do 
 What if we get it while your friends was in the room 
 Is that too much for ya?
