Whoa! x4 
 Listen 
 Pinch me if I'm dreaming 
 As a matter of fact 
 I take that back 
 Let me lay there (please) 
 Inside of your love. 
 Listening to your heart beat 
 Girl there ain't no feeling 
 Better than feeling 
 On your body 
 Girl don't you move a muscle 
 Girl I just wanna touch you 
 If you ever took your love away 
 I can truly say 
 I'd die right there today 
 Don't give me the world 
 I just want my girl. 
 If I could have anythang 
 I put it on everythang 
 That it would be you you you you 
 I just want you you you 
 You are my love 
 And my love for you girl 
 Is all that I need If I had nothing more. 
 That our love I'll be just fine with our love 
 (Oh!) (Sing on boy) 
 Your shoes can't be filled they cannot fill your heels 
 My truth is in you there is nothing that's real 
 As our love I'll be just fine as long as you're by my side 
 (Woman) 
 If you ever took your love away 
 I can truly say 
 I'd die right here today 
 Don't give me the world 
 I just want my girl. 
 If I could have anything 
 I put it on everything 
 That it would be you you you you 
 I just want you you you 
 What would I do, where would I be? 
 If there was no you, there'd be no me 
 Why don't you think about that now 
 Whoa 
 What would I do, where would I be? 
 If there was no you, there'd be no me 
 I put it on everything 
 That it would be you you you you 
 I just want you you you
