She rockin' dat thang like she holding a guitar 
 Wanna dig up out her guts like I'm rollin' a cigar 
 Body on pilattis how I ball she could volley that 
 Give it to me and she never ever want her body back 
 Eat up every piece of u I treat you like a party pack 
 All by myself shit 
 All 'cause I'm selfish 
 All on ya pelvis is where I wanna grind at 
 Grind all the time shawty make me push my grind back 
 Hammer to ya body 
 I ain't talkin' cockin nines back 
 If I could push the time back 
 I would just rewind that 
 Dream "Purple Kisses" 
 Repeat it while I eat it 
 I meant beat it I meant treat it 
 While I'm giving you the deepest 
 What I'm peepin you should see this 
 Girl I really don't believe it 
 If it's Victoria's Secret 
 U should tell her I'm a keep it 
 Matter fact 
 U can have it back 
 She get it up 
 I put it down 
 I lift her up 
 I turn her round 
 Her legs shakin 'cause she horny 
 Plus she been coming 
 Since we first start going 
 Once I hit it if you ever had a n*gga 
 Who done did it 
 Before I done hit it 
 U should quit it 'cause he ain't gon do it 
 Like I does it 'cause I does 
 No discussion you gon love it 
 On some Usher "Love in Club" shit 
 U gon want it all in public come on 
 Break: 
 I be in the club like wsup f**#*d up 
 Spendin all of my dubs on da strippers 
 Catch me in da whip bad chick gon sit 
 On the side tryna pull it out da zipper 
 She say want a star 
 Well I'm da big dipper 
 Meet me by da bar 
 They call me the big tipper 
 Babygirl you know who 
 Ain't no trickin when I pole u 
 I'm a flip you I'm a throw you I'm a show u
