When you see me in the videos babe, 
 Do I make your body go crazy? 
 Or when you catch me in a magazine baby, 
 Do you rip me out and save my page? 
 If my voice comes through your speaker 
 And you legs suddenly get weaker 
 This is for you. 
 Yeah 
 I'm hopin' it's gon' get you through. 
 So I can get to you. 
 Tell me what you see 
 When you think of me. 
 I want this to be 
 Just like your fantasy. 
 Oh, girl. 
 Girl I'm comin' over. 
 Got some things to show ya. 
 Turn yo stereo up 
 Got some sex for your stereo 
 Girl you wanna bump it 
 Turn it up don't turn me down 
 Promise that you'll love it. 
 Now put your hands on the radio, 
 Don't be scared to touch it. 
 Imagine I was there, 
 Baby pulin' on your hair. 
 Got some sex for your stereo 
 Show me how you take it 
 My words move like hands 
 And I'm singin' to you naked 
 Got some sex for your stereo 
 Girl you wanna bump it 
 Turn it up don't turn me down 
 Promise that you'll love it. 
 Now can my ladies in the back make some noise? 
 I see you. 
 It don't matter where you are. 
 In ya crib, at ya job, or in the car. 
 It's for you, 
 This is for you. 
 Wherever you can stick me in (stick me in) 
 Just let the record spin. 
 Baby it's on you. 
 What you gonna do? 
 Choice is all yours: 
 You can put me in fast-forward 
 Or 
 We can start the record over (over) 
 Can you feel my words creepin' up your legs 
 Takin' off your clothes? 
 Now you need a little bass 
 So let me give you a taste. 
 I want you to feel my subwolfer 
 Baby when I give it to ya. 
 Now you need some highs 
 So I'ma make you touch the sky. 
 Ooh, girl now slide your body near, 
 Girl take them headphones, 
 Come a little closer. 
 So I can hear you when you moan. 
 Now let me just adjust your knob 
 Turn it till I get you hot, 
 Get you hot, get you hot. 
 I won't stop, 
 Oh!
