Check 
 She my distant lover, 
 So faraway, 
 Dream of her since that day, 
 Distant lover, 
 So faraway, 
 Wish that I could bring her here to me, 
 Distant lover, 
 So faraway, 
 Girl, your so faraway, hey, 
 My distant lover, 
 My distant lover, hey, 
 My distant lover, 
 My distant lover, hey, 
 Girl you so far away, 
 So faraway, 
 So faraway, 
 My distant lover, 
 Distant lover, 
 OH!, 
 Wish that I could bring her here to me 
 Does she know, 
 What she did, 
 Turned my heart into flames, 
 From that one time, 
 That she looked my way 
 Does she know, 
 That sexy walk, 
 Still on my brain, 
 And I think, 
 That I can't, 
 I can't, I can't 
 I can't take no more, 
 I want to be lovin' you, 
 Been in love with you, 
 Since the day you came, 
 And you turned away, 
 You never leave my brain 
 OH-OH! 
 (Talking) 
 It's like, 
 I can't, 
 Get you off my brain, 
 And I don't want to 
 Does she know, 
 What she did, 
 I walk around smellin' her scent, 
 Wantin' her lips, 
 And every time I lay down, 
 Go to sleep it is you, 
 That I see, 
 Wish you'd come to me, 
 Cause you still on my brain, 
 I just can't, 
 I just can't 
 I can't take no more, 
 I want to be lovin' you, 
 Been in love with you, 
 Since the day you came, 
 And you turned away, 
 You never leave my brain 
 Never leave, 
 No, 
 My distant lover!, 
 My distant lover!(girl you so faraway), 
 So faraway, 
 I wish that I could bring you here to me 
 I can't take no more, 
 I want to be lovin' you, 
 Been in love with you, 
 (Wish that I could bring you here to me) 
 Distant lover, 
 Distant lover, 
 You never leave my brain 
 I can't take no more, 
 I want to be lovin' you, 
 Been in love with you, 
 My distant lover, 
 I wish that I could bring you here to me
