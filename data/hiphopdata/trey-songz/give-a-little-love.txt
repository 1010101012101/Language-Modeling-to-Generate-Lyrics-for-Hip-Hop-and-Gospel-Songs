Single girl 
 On her own 
 Everyday she works hard for the money, 
 Feed her little child... give a little smile 
 Try not to cry when she asked for her daddy, 
 Heres my heart... heres my heart, 
 Goes out to you tonight, along with, 
 My deepest prayer... deepest prayer, 
 That god brings you too the light 
 I see a light round the corner, 
 I see a war that ain't over yeah, 
 So much life that's unpretty, 
 But so much beauty you just can't miss 
 If you... give a little love 
 For every father that walked out 
 There's a daddy that loves his child 
 No one seems there is no way out 
 But life turns out right 
 If you... give a little love 
 Fine young man... off to war... don't understand, 
 What he fighting for, 
 Yet he reports, 
 Obeys his call of duty and he fights for his country 
 Heres my heart... heres my heart, 
 Goes out to you tonight, along with, 
 My deepest prayer... deepest prayer, 
 That god brings you too the light 
 I see a light round the corner, 
 I see a war that ain't over yeah, 
 So much life that's unpretty, 
 But so much beauty you just can't miss 
 If you... give a little love 
 For every father that walked out 
 There's a daddy that loves his child 
 No one seems there is no way out 
 But life turns out right 
 If you... give a little love 
 I see a light round the corner, 
 I see a war that ain't over yeah, 
 So much life that's unpretty, 
 But so much beauty you just can't miss
