I don't wanna do too much 
 I don't wanna speak too much 
 I don't wanna breathe the wrong way 
 I don't wanna kill this moment 
 This moment shared between us 
 'Cause I been thinking 'bout it all day, oh whoa 
 You told me I'm all you wanted 
 I don't wanna ruin your expectations 
 And all your body language, I'm gon' read it, ay 
 As best as I can (as best as I can) 'cause tonight I am 
 Having sex with my number 1 fan 
 So why am I so nervous? 
 So why am I so nervous? 
 Having sex with my number 1 fan 
 So why am I so nervous? 
 Having sex with my number 1 fan 
 So why am I so nervous? 
 I don't wanna move too fast 
 Girl, I wanna make it last 
 Tonight we gonna do it my way, oh 
 I know you been waiting for it 
 You gotta just lay back 
 I just wanna take my time, babe 
 You told me I'm all you wanted 
 I don't wanna ruin your expectations, oh no no no no 
 And all your body language, I'm gon' read it, ay 
 As best as I can (as best as I can) 'cause tonight I am 
 Having sex with my number 1 fan 
 So why am I so nervous?

 You ready? 
 When I leave it up to me, she sees 
 Will I give her everything she needs? 
 I just hope that when we're done she's pleased 
 I hope it's everything you thought it'd be, oh 
 You told me I'm all you wanted 
 I don't wanna ruin your expectations 
 And all your body language, I'm gon' read it (all night long) 
 As best as I can (as best as I can) 'cause tonight I am 
 Having sex with my number 1 fan (so why am I) 
 So why am I so nervous? (Nervous, baby)
