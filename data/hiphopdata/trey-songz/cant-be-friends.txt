Look what this girl done did to me 
 She done cut me off from her good good love. 
 She told me that those days were gone (gone, gone, gone) 
 Now I'm sitting here going half crazy 
 'Cause I know she still thinks about me too 
 And it ain't no way in hell, that I can be just friends with you (you, you, you) 
 And I wish we never did it 
 And I wish we never loved it 
 And I wish I never feel so deep in love with you and now it ain't no way we can be friends. 
 The way it felt, no faking it 
 Maybe we were moving just a little too fast. 
 But what we've done we can't take it back (back, back, back) 
 Now I'm sitting here half-way crazy 
 'Cause I know she still thinks about me too 
 And it ain't no way in hell, that I can be just friends with you (you, you, you) 
 And I wish we never did it 
 And I wish we never loved it 
 And I wish I never feel so deep in love with you and now ain't no way we can be friends. 
 And all I can say is 
 La la la la la la la (laaaaa) 
 La la la la la la la la la (la la la owwww) 
 La la la la la la (laaaa) 
 Hey, Ain't no telling what we could've been 
 Ain't no telling what we could've been (No) 
 And if I knew it would end like this, 
 I never woulda kissed ya, 'cause I fell in love wit ya, 
 We never woulda kicked it, girl now everything's different 
 I lost my homie, lover, and my friend that's why I wish we never did it 
 (Ouu lay) 
 And I wish we never loved it (I wish we never loved it) 
 And I wish I never feel so deep in love with you and now ain't no way we can be friends. 
 La la la la la la la la laaaaa 
 La la la la la la la la laaaaa
