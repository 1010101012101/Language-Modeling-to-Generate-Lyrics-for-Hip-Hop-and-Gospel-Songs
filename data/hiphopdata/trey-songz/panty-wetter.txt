Here we go, here again, here again 
 I wanna know, how you been, how you been 
 Such a surprise, didn't think you'd come back so soon 
 Got drink in my cup girl, got weed rolled up but I'm high of you tonight 
 Bet yo ass ain't think I will come so hard upon this Chapter V 
 I've toured the world and made some money, learned some different things 
 And now I'm here to show your body what these lyrics mean 
 Your Panty Dropper has returned and I'm goin' low 
 To please your body is my mission if you don't know 
 Just take our time I just wanna go nice and slow 
 First thing take off them clothes 
 But you can leave them panties on 
 You've had my love before 
 So you know I might make 'em soak 
 'Cause I'm your panty wetter 
 I'm your panty wetter 
 You ain't gotta take 'em off 
 Just pull it to the side 
 Don't you try to fight girl 
 Ain't no place to hide 
 I'm your panty wetter 
 And you know it don't, it won't 
 It know better 
 No one is gonna get you wetter 
 Here we are you and me, you and me 
 A special show made for two to see 
 We 'bout to make the best love you've ever dreamed 
 But you gon' have to come about them clothes 
 You can leave them panties on 
 You've had this love before 
 So you know I 'bout to make 'em soak 
 'Cause I'm your panty wetter 
 I'm your panty wetter 
 You ain't gotta take 'em off 
 Just pull it to the side 
 Don't you try to fight girl 
 Ain't no place to hide 
 I'm your panty wetter 
 And you know it don't, it won't 
 It can't know you better 
 No one is gonna get you wetter 
 Break it down 
 All the way down 
 I'm your panty wetter, I'm yours I'm yours 
 Panty wetter 
 You ain't gotta take 'em off 
 Just pull it to the side 
 Don't you try to fight girl 
 Ain't no place to hide 
 I'm your panty wetter 
 And you know it don't, it won't 
 It can't know you better 
 No one is gonna get you wetter 
 No one is gonna get you better than a fountain 
 Waterfall off my mountain 
 It's such beauty when we be 
 I'm the sand and you're the sea 
 I'm the pipe girl you're the leak 
 It's only one thing left you can do for me 
 Take 'em off, take 'em off, take 'em off 
 Please
