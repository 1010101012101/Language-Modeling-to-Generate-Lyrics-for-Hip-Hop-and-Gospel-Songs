(Talking) 
 I'd do anything just to hear your voice 
 It's been to long, since I sen your face 
 Since I smelt the fragrance of your perfume 
 And I can't get a hold of my self, 
 No more, I tried to play it cool 
 But I'm simply breaking breaking breaking down girl 
 I need you to build me up again girl, build me up again 
 I neglected you, expected you to stay forever (yes I did) 
 Now you're gone and I'm suppose to find another... no no 
 Girl I need you to, 
 Please return my call 'cause I sorry 
 And I need to hear from you 
 I was wrong that's why i... 
 Girl I need you to 
 Please return my call 
 Promise I regret it all 
 Only we know what I lost 
 I just wanna talk so wherever you are please return my call 
 Now I'd give up anything for the joy only yourself can bring 
 Just to see your face come through that door 
 But until then I'm gone pray some more, 
 Yeah I'm gone pray some more please by the bedside 
 'Cause your the best thing that happened in my life 
 And I gotta get you back and I'm dealing with the fact that I know 
 I neglected you expected you to stay forever 
 Now you're gone and I'm suppose to find another oh 
 (Talking)

 And I know your mad, better yet I know your dissapointed but I promise I'll do better just answer the phone
