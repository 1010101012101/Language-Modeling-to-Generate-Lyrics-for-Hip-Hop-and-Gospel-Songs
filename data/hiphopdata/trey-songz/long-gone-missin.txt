The Prince is back! 
 May Day, Trey Day 
 So here we go with this again 
 Running at them lips again 
 Yellin' in my ear and shit 
 All I hear is whisperin' 
 No matter what it is 
 She always start to bitchin' and 
 Trippin' and 
 I almost start to call that girl a bitch again 
 So I blaze out the house 
 In a rage out the house 
 Shawty got a sharp tongue 
 She spit blades out her mouth 
 I throw my stunnas on 
 I chop blades out the house 
 She get ta growlin' and I'm out 
 It's like a cage in the house 
 Phone on silent and I'm wilin' 'cause I'm 'bout 
 Five shots of Henny in 
 Man, I'm makin' plenty friends 
 Black, white, Dominican 
 Back right, I break it in 
 (This is the act right) 
 I need to take it in 
 Let's go! 
 I been drinkin' 
 Tryin'-a take my mind up off all the yellin' and all the screamin' 
 But all that it's doin' is takin' me far from your lovin' 
 Got this girl in my ear, tellin' me what I don't need to hear 
 Sippin' what I'm sippin and she 'bout to catch me slippin' 
 I'm long gone missin' 
 Long gone missin' 
 And I'm up in this club with all of these women 
 This one she said she wanna get me alone 
 You bad as hell, but girl I gotta go home 
 I'm long gone missin', long gone missin' 
 And I'm up in this club with all of these women 
 This one she said she wanna get me alone 
 You bad as hell, but girl I gotta go home 
 Now she's grindin' 
 And the way she poppin' that thang 
 Droppin' that thang 
 Reminds me 
 It ain't a girl in this world like mines 
 Wish she come find me (hope you hurry up) 
 It's gettin' heated up (got me heated up) 
 If she keep it up 
 We gon' be leavin' here (I'm sippin) 
 Sippin' what I'm sippin and she 'bout to catch me slippin' 
 I'm long gone missin' 
 Long gone missin' 
 And I'm up in this club with all of these women 
 This one she said she wanna get me alone 
 You bad as hell, but girl I gotta go home 
 I'm long gone missin', long gone missin' 
 And I'm up in this club with all of these women 
 This one she said she wanna get me alone 
 You bad as hell, but girl I gotta go home 
 Now I look around 
 And all I see is cuties 
 Booties bouncin' all around 
 I'm tryin'-a keep myself from goin' down 
 With all the love I give you all you ever do is frown 
 Sippin' what I'm sippin' and she 'bout to catch me slippin' 
 I'm long gone missin' 
 Long gone missin' 
 And I'm up in this club with all of these women 
 This one she said she wanna get me alone 
 You bad as hell, but girl I gotta go home 
 I'm long gone missin', long gone missin' 
 And I'm up in this club with all of these women 
 This one she said she wanna get me alone 
 You bad as hell, but girl I gotta go home 
 I'm long gone missin' 
 Long gone missin' 
 And I'm up in this club with all of these women 
 This one she said she wanna get me alone 
 You bad as hell, but girl I gotta go home 
 I'm long gone missin', long gone missin' 
 And I'm up in this club with all of these women 
 This one she said she wanna get me alone 
 You bad as hell, but girl I gotta go home
