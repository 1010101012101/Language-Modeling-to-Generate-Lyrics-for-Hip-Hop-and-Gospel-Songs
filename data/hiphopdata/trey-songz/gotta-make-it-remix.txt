 I tried a suit with a smile (it ain't fit me) and I played the block for a while (tried to kill me) 
 No matter what you gio through I know 1 thing is true keep beliving in you 
 'Cause when itz feeling like you (jus can't take it) 
 And no matter what you do (it keep breaking) 
 Lift your head to the sky tell yourself I (jus gotta make it) I (jus gotta make it)

 Before you give up just take a second babi 
 Look in the mirror your reflection ladai
