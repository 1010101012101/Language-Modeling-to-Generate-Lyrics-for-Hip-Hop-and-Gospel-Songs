I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes 
 I suppose 
 I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
 I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
 I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
 Ah yeah Trey I fuckin' feel ya 
 They be starin' at the money ilike its unfamilar 
 I get it, I live it to me there's nothing realer 
 Just enough'll solve your problems 
 Too much'll kill ya 
 And when I leave I always come right back here 
 The young spitter that everybody in rap fear 
 Alotta y'all is still soundin' like last year 
 The game needs change and I'm the mothafuckin' cashier 
 Nickel for my thoughts, dimes in my bed 
 Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head 
 Take my verses too serious and you'll hate me 
 'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD 
 I want it all that's why I strive for it 
 Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it 
 Any award show or party I get fly for it 
 I know that it's coming I just hope that I'm alive for it 
 I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes 
 I suppose 
 I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
 I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
 I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
 I want the money, money, money I want a whole lot of that 
 All the honeys they askin' where the dollars at 
 Where yo' head at, tell me 'bout your styling cap 
 Tryna find a way but you never got a map 
 Dream chaser, risk taker 
 No favor, though haters 
 They might want me to drown 
 Holdin' me down 
 But the throne and the crown 
 Is all I ever wanted, all I ever needed 
 If I'm the only one and don't nobody else believe it 
 Then keep it a secret nd watch me achieve it 
 'Cause I know what I want now 
 So if you want the money 
 If you gotta make 
 If you the only one nd don t nobody else believe it 
 Then tell 'em to beat it 
 And watch you achieve it 
 Sing it if you want 
 I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes 
 I suppose 
 I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
 I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
 I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
 Yeah, I want things top go my way 
 But as of late alotta shit been goin' sidewqays 
 And my mother tried to run away from home 
 But I left something in the car 
 So I caught her in the driveway 
 And she cried to me, so I cried too 
 And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2" 
 And 40 that was all before I showed up 
 And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up 
 Damn, my reality just set in 
 And even when the Phantom's leased them hoes wanna get in 
 I do alot of things hopin' I never have to fit in 
 So tryna keep up with my progress is like a dead end 
 My girl love me, but fuck it my heart beats slow 
 And right now the tour bus is looking like a freak show 
 And life change for us every single week so 
 It's good but I hope this ain't the peak though 
 'Cause I want the 
 I want the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes 
 I suppose 
 I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
 I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful 
 I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
