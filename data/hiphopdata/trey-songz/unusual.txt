And I wouldn't be me 
 If I didn't get a little nasty 
 They say all I ever talk about is sex 
 How 'bout we just move over 
 And do it where we at? 
 How 'bout you just lift that skirt up 
 Ooh, we can be bad 
 That place that ain't been touched 
 I'm finning on it 
 I'll let you sit through, keep spinning on it 
 Girl, giddy up, giddy up, take me on a ride to ecstasy 
 You don't wanna bump, bump, then take a nap 
 You just wanna bump, bump, bring it right back 
 Watch me 
 I'ma heat it up, beat it up, oh 
 Know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual 
 I can give you more than the usual 
 Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch 
 You gon' feel something unusual 
 Unusual, unusual 
 I'm not gon' with the usual 
 Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch 
 You gon' feel something unusual 
 I wanna do the wicked things you never do 
 What if we did it while your friends was in the room 
 Is that too much for ya? 
 Don't you feel bad, let 'em feel sexy 
 We can make a sex room wherever we go 
 Take it to the restroom, they ain't gotta know 
 No, oh 
 Watch me heat it up, beat it up 
 Woo, hey, do you hear me, girl? 
 Watch me heat it up, beat it up 
 Woo 
 Know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual 
 I can give you more than the usual 
 Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch 
 You gon' feel something unusual 
 Unusual, unusual 
 I'm not gon' with the usual 
 Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch 
 You gon' feel something unusual

 This that other shit, you know you ask for it 
 I might just save you some money and get ya passport 
 So you can come to me city, I'll take you all over 
 And hit you on the balcony, just don't fall over 
 Send me a picture, baby, you know I'd never leak it 
 I know you got something recent for someone decent 
 Why you laughing out loud? I'm serious 
 Bring your girl if you a little bi-curious 
 Please, please no storytelling to others 
 I promise you gon' love it, I would never let you down 
 Feel like I might have perfected all the things that you've expected 
 And you gon' know it when you bring your ass around 
 Know you're tired of the usual, usual, usual 
 I can give you more than the usual 
 Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch 
 You gon' feel something unusual

 Not your regular, tell you what, let me touch 
 You gon' feel something unusual

 All different places 
 Look at the many little faces you making 
 But can you take it? 
 I thought I was nasty last time 
 Let's go
