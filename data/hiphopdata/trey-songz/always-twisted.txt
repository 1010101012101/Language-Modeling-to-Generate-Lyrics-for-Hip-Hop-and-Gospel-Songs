Always twisted 
 When I leave the club 
 Body full Of Liqour 
 Playing wit ya girl 
 And since I'm Trey 
 U know she love me 
 Tell her I love her back 
 And when she done wit me 
 U can have her back 
 Songz slaughter more by the day 
 August 4th READY on the way 
 Black Tints on the whip while the driver drivin' 
 Hottest muthafucka in the world inside it 
 And while you in the world residing 
 I'm on another planet haters internet spam 'em 
 They can't stand him Trey some "Damn Them" 
 Tell 'em eat turkey burger 'cause I'm bout to HAM them 
 Tremaine spit flames man somebody bring the fans in 
 Better yet the hoes in tell 'em leave clothes in 
 The bin at the front door what I gotta front for? 
 Flow so graphic put the beat in plastic 
 Wrap it 
 Throw it in the dirt pick it up 
 All you niggas dirt give it up 
 Big whip big wheels when I park like jurassic 
 Skinny girls or chicks wit thick asses see green like tha Masters 
 "TIGER" when I bite her stick my WOOD up inside her 
 She ignite my fire treat me like a pacifier 
 Hope she don't burn threw the rubber like a tire 
 When mashing in the chevy like I'm driving it for hire 
 Uhn... Whoa... And She Know... 
 I'm Always Twisted When I Leave Club 
 Body full of liquid pocket full dubs 
 Headed to the telly or 2 another club 
 Tell me is READY you want me 2 beat it up 
 Beat it up beat it up baby is you keeping up 
 Got the money got the fame but 2 me that ain't enough 
 Ain't the type 2 complain I just beat a nigga up 
 U niggas get out lane watch my feet 'n' eat my dust 
 They always bitchin' when I'm the club 
 Cause all they bitches wanna get wit us 
 VIP 'cause she like what she and the bottles on me 
 So the bottles all free for her 
 She wanna see me wit her 
 I wanna see me her and her friend doin' it again and again and again 
 Shawty gone spin 
 Quick don't let it slip can you keep the dick in 
 Oh you know you know I'm so nasty 
 And I won't gone let ya phat ass walk past me 
 I wanna rub body down like you ashy 
 Call a nigga "Lassie" 
 Do anything you ask me 
 Shawty give that mega brain mega brain so insane long as you don't paper plane 
 Government tax me 
 Actually I'm done wit this shit 
 You can go and run wit this shit... oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oho oh oh oh oh oh
