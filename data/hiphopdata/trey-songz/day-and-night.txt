Tell me what's happening 
 I'm addicted to plastering 
 These rappers beats with my vocals 
 What happens when I'm ask to sing 
 No problemo, instrumentals 
 I guess they ask for me 
 Then I answer, give them cancer 
 And they come back for me 
 So why the mad at me 
 Cause my mental capacity 
 Get to over lapping them bastards, the audacity 
 Haters even clap 4 me, realizing actually 
 I represent the betterment 
 And they just late like Letterman, man 
 Trey Songz, Page Long 
 List of who I'm better than 
 Contact my B.A. Zon 
 I might need excederin 
 Sicker than I never been 
 They want me instead of them 
 And if they dislike it 
 I'm letting them so let them in 
 Guess I'm spose to let them win 
 If you was to bet again 
 It be best if would just 
 Put paper on the neverson 
 I'll let you know 
 I walk all through your vestibule 
 I guess you know, I'll stretch ya hole 
 Her love drip on my testicles 
 T.M.I. but he is I 
 And I am him flying then 
 Propellers you so jealous 
 You can tell us just e-mail us 
 I'm a problem, no you hating 
 There ain't no calculating 
 I'm So Nasty on the beat 
 Just like a freak that's masterbatin 
 Be makin' fashin statements 
 When I leave my place of residence 
 Feel like I'm intelligent 
 And everybody is hella dence 
 Irrelavent and the only exception is 
 My relevance you lookin' at the future 
 If ever I'm in ya presence shit 
 Hated right, Trey be like 
 Haters get your paper right 
 Swear you fly, tellin' lies 
 Couldn't live a faker life 
 They love it, shout out to Kid Cuddi 
 I like to live lovely 
 And your city something pretty 
 Why the kids call you ugly 
 Man I'm bugging, I be tripping 
 I be playing but they listening 
 I'm saying what the business 
 What you missing I'm the illest 
 I do this 'n' my free time 
 And you can search 
 But you will never find a weak line
