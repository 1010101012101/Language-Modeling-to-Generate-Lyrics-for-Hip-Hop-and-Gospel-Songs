Chica-Uh 
 Chica-Uh, Chica-Uh Songz 
 He left his heart at the counter, 
 Met a stranger in a foreign town, 
 They say the city was pretty, 
 They say what goes around comes back around, 
 And then there's a sound, 
 What's that sound? That, That's panic, 
 (Uh) Skitsofrantic, 
 (Uh) Psychopathic lover. 
 But through his eyes, 
 She look so beautiful. 
 But through his eyes, 
 She looks so harmless, 
 And out of the sky, 
 Pain starts falling down. 
 And out of the sky, 
 His eyes go blind, blind 
 His eyes go blind, blind, blind 
 His eyes go blind, blind, blind 
 Chica-Uh (Oh) 
 Chica-Uh (Oh) 
 He left his face on the table, 
 Put his nose smack dead on the line, 
 And you can check at the bar, 
 He the talk of the town, now, now, now, now, 
 His new love can no longer be found, 
 Hey what's that sound? 
 Listen out for the sound of paramedics, 
 (Uh) Just forget it, 
 (Uh) He should have seen it, 
 But through his eyes, 
 She look so beautiful. 
 But through his eyes, 
 She looks so harmless, 
 And out of the sky, 
 Pain starts falling down. 
 And out of the sky, 
 His eyes go blind, blind 
 But through his eyes, 
 She look so beautiful. 
 But through his eyes, 
 She looks so harmless, 
 And out of the sky, 
 Pain starts falling down. 
 And there ain't no way to run, 
 Ain't no way to hide, 
 Through his eyes, 
 She look so beautiful. 
 And through his eyes, 
 She looks so harmless, 
 And out of the sky, 
 Pain starts falling down. (Pain, Pain, Pain) 
 And out of the sky, 
 His eyes go blind, blind 
 His eyes go Blind (blind, blind, blind) 
 His eyes go blind, blind, blind 
 His eyes go Blind (blind, blind, blind) 
 His eyes go blind, blind, blind 
 And out of the sky, 
 Pain starts falling down. (Pain, Pain, Pain) 
 And out of the sky, 
 His eyes go blind, [fading out] blind, blind
