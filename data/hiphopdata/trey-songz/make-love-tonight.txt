Excuse me woman, but it's something on my mind and I gotta get it off my chest, 
 Baby girl I must confess, and I'm trying to say it with finesse, 
 And it won't take nothing, just a little bit of time and a body up inside your dress, 
 I promise it will be the best, and baby I ain't talkin' sex. 
 Can we make love tonight, 
 Get the champagne poppin' off tonight, with your secrets coming off tonight, 
 Can we make love tonight, 
 Bubble bath with only candlelight, and massage your body bet you'll like it. 
 Cause you gon' feel it from the minute that you walk in the room, 
 I'll have the candles burning, while the waters running and the musics playing there'll be no delaying, 
 Outside its raining but its cool, 
 'Cause I'll just pull you closer and hold you tighter and I'll say to you. 
 Let's take this night for loving, and make it last till morning, 
 (We'll be) touching, (and we) kissing, freakin, so can we...
