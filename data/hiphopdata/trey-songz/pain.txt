Passion... pain... pleasure 
 It hurts when I laugh sometimes, feels good when I cry 
 Tell me when you looking at me 
 Can you see the pain in my eyes 
 As the stars shine deep in the night sky 
 As the sun sits way above the clouds 
 As the world spins time and time again 
 Look at myself wondering where I've been 
 City to city and girl with you one nights all I got to give 
 You don't know me no matter how I might appear 
 Will I ever know why do I feel so alone? 
 Since a child I was told, all that glitters ain't gold 
 Got lost in the moment, tryna find what I wanted 
 So I'm drowning in regret, and I'll never forget 
 Everything that I had, for the good turned bad
