When the story first began 
 Before you were my friend, 
 Baby I wanted you to come my way 
 Just the mere concept of you 
 Girl I had these thouqhts of you 
 Like a vision of love dream come true 
 Girl I give my life to make you think of me (and girl you know I would) 
 Girl I need your love to make me feel complete 
 All my life, I been wanting me a chick like you for me, 
 All my life, tryna have what I saw on the movie screen, 
 All my life, I been tryna make a dream reality, 
 All my life, I been wanting to make this thing complete 
 Shawty you and me. 
 So can we make my vision real 
 With the love I can feel 
 Can you walk in my dreams and appear to me 
 Cause your the perfect one I choose 
 You're my partner I can't loose 
 If you play on my team shawty you will see 
 Girl I give my life to make you think of me (and baby girl I need your love) 
 Girl I need your love to make my life complete 
 All my life, I been wanting me a chick like you for me, 
 All my life, been tryna have what I saw on the movie screen, 
 All my life, I been tryna make a dream reality all my life, 
 All my life, I been wanting to make this thing complete 
 Shawty you and me (baby all my life) 
 And if you want to know the truth 
 Shawty you're the one I choose, 
 The one that lives only here in my mind 
 (You're the only one that lives in my mind) 
 And if the only thing I do, 
 Is make it through to you, 
 I'd be satisfied 
 All my life, I been wanting me a chick like you for me, 
 All my life, tryna have what I saw on the movie screen, 
 All my life, I been tryna make a dream reality, 
 All my life, I been wanting to make this thing complete 
 Shawty you and me. 
 All my life, I been wanting me a chick like you for me, 
 All my life, tryna have what I saw on the movie screen, 
 All my life, I been tryna make a dream reality, 
 All my life...
