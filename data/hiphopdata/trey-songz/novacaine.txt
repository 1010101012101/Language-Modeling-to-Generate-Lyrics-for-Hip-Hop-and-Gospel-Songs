Oh-oh-oh- Oh 
 Oh -oh 
 Oh- oh- oh 
 So Many Memories In My Mind 
 I've Erased Like a page in a book I Written untold 
 So many women walk on my arm Cause the charm I put on 
 I Admit I Left A Bunch Of Them Swoon 
 Standin In A Room Full Of Mirrors Yelling 
 But it's like they can hear When I say 
 I Gotta Stone Heart In My Chest 
 I Can't Feel No Pain, 
 I'll never love another women 
 Its Just Me And My Money 
 I Think I Took A Shot In The Vein 
 Like Novocaine Novacaine 
 Novacaine Novacaine 
 Like Novacaine 
 Ain't enough fingers for the times that I lied 
 Can't even remember last time that I cried 
 But I cried oh! did i... i... 
 Ain't no turnin' back o this road 
 Busy chasin stacks and the hoes 
 Affection is a person I don't know 
 Living in a world so cold 
 I Gotta Stone Heart In My Chest 
 I Can't Feel No Pain, 
 I'll never love another women 
 Its Just Me And My Money 
 I Think I Took A Shot In The Vein 
 Like Novocaine Novacaine 
 Novacaine Novacaine 
 Like Novacaine 
 I Gotta Stone Heart In My Chest 
 I Can't Feel No Pain, 
 I'll never love another women 
 Its Just Me And My Money 
 I Think I Took A Shot In The Vein 
 Like Novocaine Novacaine 
 Novacaine Novacaine 
 Like Novacaine
