They used to neglect him 
 But his style is perfection 
 Stay in the VIP Section 
 I was born wit a blessin 
 Swagg is my reflection 
 So you see it when you see me 
 And All I gotta do is be me 
 Who you think it do it like I does it? 
 Let's discus it 
 G's repect him world wide 
 And The women wanna fukk him 
 Who you think I'm is, shit 
 I could give a fukk, what? 
 Holdin' my nuts suck 
 No one on the corner gotta swagga like Trey do 
 Impeccable swagg on every track Trey do 
 U ain't gotta ask me why (I) eat the tracks up like apple pie (Yup!) 
 If you ain't got swagga can't learn how to have it 
 If I could, I'll give you some && autograph it 
 And It ain't about my outfit 
 Even though it's nice shit 
 I bring it to life trick 
 Shirt 300 (Fa' Sho') 
 Shoes 7 (Fa' Sho') 
 I'm so fly like a pair of sails sailin (Yup!) 
 I'm so high like 7-5-7 (U Know!)

 The future 
 You could be the past

 Send a message to the hataz: I jus wanna thank ya 
 U be helpin 'em make me greater 
 Trigga blowin' up like a skytell pager 
 Pretty Boy face like a commercial for a razor 
 I cut the braids && I tell 'em get they waves up! 
 I'm gettin' chips so I tell 'em get they Lays up! 
 (Tell 'em watchu gon do) 
 Kill it, purse it, whole funerals for each one of my verses 
 (Tell 'em why you hella koo) 
 Really that's worthless 
 I'm so G like her shoes && her purses 
 She said she like tha way I work this microphone 
 Baby, wait till I getcha home
