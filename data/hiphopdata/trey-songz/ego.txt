(Trey Talking) 
 Uh this goes out to you (you) and you (you) and you (you) and you 
 Oh listen 
 (First Verse) 
 To say I'm egotistical 
 Is so stereotypical 
 If I say I'm the shit then baby you can be my tissue roll 
 Girl you like a tootsie roll 
 How many licks do it take till it stick to my face (I wanna know) 
 45 46... 50 licks 
 Got somewhere to go so can we make it quick 
 Not a quickie though 
 Have faith like biggie though 
 I'm on the chase for that Diddy doe 
 I should make a sex video 
 Way I'm hitting hoes 
 They be singing opera like figueroa figueroa figueroa 
 Yeah singin' nigga from the ghetto 
 Ain't nothing like a pretty woman in stilettos 
 (Yeaa) sex olympics I won a medal 
 Girl you need to ride no breaks no pedals 
 Yeah I'm drunker then a motherfucka 
 Even when I'm drunk tho I'm hotter then these other bustas 
 They say I'm wrong for saying that 
 (Well) But shit you wrong for saying that 
 I'm sippin' on dos equis 
 You so petty 
 I'm so Ready 
 Once had a awkward moment only 'cause I wanted to 
 Middle finger my opponents (F You) 
 Baby girl I'm zoning 
 And I really give a fuck if you was on it 
 Song called bedroom could you feature on it 
 Satin sheets bed room I'ma beat chu on it 
 They say my head big 
 Cause my head is 
 So I walk like my legs big 
 Is it illegal to have an ego the size of Pluto 
 When I, know that I'm flier 
 Then any guy that chu know 
 Baby what cha name is 
 Tell me who you hang wit 
 Money out the anus 
 I can make you famous 
 So many people say that I'm conceited 
 (Well damn.! Come on) 
 I'm starting to believe it 
 Set a lot of goals and I'm starting to achieve it 
 Tell me what's the reason 
 Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall 
 All of y'all think I'm the one you wanna be with 
 I be on some "G" shit 
 I hit it the deepest 
 Chorus (Beyonce) 
 It's Too big 
 It's Too wide 
 It's Too strong 
 It won't fit 
 It's too much 
 It's too tough 
 (Trey) 
 She talk like this 'cause I can back it up (true) 
 I got a big YOU KNOW (yes I do) 
 Such a huge YOU KNOW 
 It's so big 
 And she love my big YOU KNOW (that's what she said) 
 I talk like this 'cause I can back it up 
 (Second Verse) 
 Flight got delayed I was waiting on the call 
 Couple hours later performing for a crowd 
 Said that I'm the shit 
 Shawty watch me move her bowel 
 Just like Vana White when shawty move a vowel 
 Beast tryna eat a wilder beast on the prowl 
 Get it super wet know you gone need a towel 
 You a super freak gone and put it in yo mouth 
 Half on a baby we gone end up with a child 
 Chorus (Beyonce) 
 It's Too big 
 It's Too wide 
 It's Too strong 
 It won't fit 
 It's too much 
 It's too tough 
 (Trey) 
 She talk like this 'cause I can back it up (true) 
 I got a big YOU KNOW (yes I do) 
 Such a huge YOU KNOW 
 It's so big 
 And she love my big YOU KNOW (that's what she said) 
 I talk like this 'cause I can back it up
