Lookin' through my bible, searchin for a song to sing. 
 Heard a beautiful man done passed away. 
 And I really wonder why Lord, did you take him from me. 
 See heaven's the only place that he needs to be. 
 And I know that you never felt pain, pain like you feel today. Please remember this when I say, you got a set of wings today. 
 Heard ya got your set of wings today, open 'em up and fly away. 
 I heard ya got your set of wings today, open 'em up. 
 You see the world don't deserve your love no more. 
 The Lord done opened up Heaven's doors for you. 
 C'mon, walk on through. Walk on through, yeah. 
 Peaceful, loving, true, and kind. 
 Was the father friend of mine. 
 Drinks like funny and keepin' it real. 
 They both were a part of Mr. Hill. 
 Memories will keep afloat, got a heart so genuine. (So true) 
 And he's smilin' down us on now, said he's smilin' down on us now. 
 Heard ya got your set of wings today, open 'em up and fly away. 
 Heard ya got your set of wings today, 
 I know you got your set of wings. 
 See the world don't deserve your love no more. 
 Lord done opened up Heaven's doors for you, walk on through. 
 He opened 'em up for you. Yes he did, gon walk on through. 
 He opened 'em up for you. 
 Dedicated to the loving memory of Mr. Micheal Hill, the Hill family, and any other family that's lost somebody 
 That they cherished and loved. 
 Mr. Hill used to always tell me to say "I'm proud of you, boy". 
 Used to have that smile, that big koolaid smile. Cool dude man. 
 We miss you, already, we miss you. Rest in peace. 
 The world don't deserve your love no more. 
 The Lord done opened up Heaven's doors for you. Walk on through. Heard ya got your set of wings today, open 'em up and fly away. 
 Heard ya got ya set of wings today, open 'em up and fly away.
