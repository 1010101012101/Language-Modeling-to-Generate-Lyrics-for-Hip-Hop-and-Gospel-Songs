You love me like words can't explain 
 For me to feel the same is all you wanna gain 
 You never claim that the dollars made me change 
 But the models givin' brain 
 Guess that could fuck with your brain 
 Hurt your heart in the worst way 
 Never should have let you fall in the first place 
 But you've fallen, put your all in 
 Now you're so high off love you don't wanna get down 
 Most nights she ain't sleep 
 Worried where I might or I might not be 
 Sheesh! for the life for me 
 Man what a life I lead 
 You kept me on this pedestal 
 No matter how much I let you down 
 (Down x3) I let you down (down x3) 
 With all my infidelity 
 You loved me so incredibly 
 Inside I'll fall apart 
 If you ever love someone instead of me 
 (Instead of me) 
 So you deserve a better man 
 (Instead of me, instead of me) 
 Clock won't stop (tick, tock) 
 Her love is going, going, going 
 - By the minute 
 Going, going, going 
 - She keep giving 
 But I know she can't take it 
 Still her heart I keep breaking 
 So I'm a let her love go 
 'Cause I don't deserve her love no more 
 Sad story 
 She mad for me 
 And mad at me 
 Sad that we 
 Can't exude love 
 Not a true love 
 'Cause it's all screwed up 
 You kept me on this pedestal 
 No matter how much I let you down 
 (Down x3) I let you down (down x3) 
 With all my infidelity 
 You loved me so incredibly 
 Inside I'll fall apart 
 If you ever love someone instead of me 
 (Rap) 
 How do you fix a love undone 
 How you even know if you're fit to love someone 
 And when you decide to take that ride 
 Can you drive from the passengers side 
 One wheel in the middle 
 Four hands on it 
 Two sets of breaks 
 You decide to slam on it 
 God damn woman 
 Where the love go 
 Whip crash will you get whiplash 
 Sit back cause you won't get shit back 
 But think if you tried to get what you just had back 
 She mad at facts 
 And you can't be mad at that 
 (You can't be mad at that) x2 
 Whoa x5 
 (Clock won't stop - tick, tock) x2 
 You kept me on this pedestal 
 No matter how much 
 I let you down 
 I let you down
