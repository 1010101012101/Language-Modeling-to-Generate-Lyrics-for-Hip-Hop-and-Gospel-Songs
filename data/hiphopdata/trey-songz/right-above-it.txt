 Matter fact, salute the shit, hands where ya parts are 
 Still make a fuckin' movie, girls know what their parts are 
 I get brain in the whip, who needs a smart car? 
 Call me when it's real beef, fuck alla this tartar 
 Niggas don't touch key, 'cept for when they start cars 
 They just talkin' out they ass, those are fart bars

 And that's just in a section 
 They all swallow and gobble; call it digestion 
 Women dance on my sac; call it dickonics 
 The shit read lips until it's hooked on phonic 
 I'ma brag at ya shawty; you know I probably had her

 Porn star; she's a ghetto gagger 
 Rockin' platinum, I never got the plaque 
 Still I drop 30 grand up at Sacs

 Hit the club; all balck

 Come fly wit me; MJ 2K11 
 Look in the mirror and it's clearer than it has been 
 I talk shit to the homie like he my glass twin 
 I say "don't let the get ahead of me 
 They want them instead of me, but I'm so much better 
 Aye, you know how it better be 
 I'ma sail past niggas; cruise to a better sea 
 Same light, same night, but I'm in a better B 
 Plus my hoe hotter than Huxtable sweater be 
 And she talk dirty like a thrown away berretta be 
 Now come and fuck wit 'im 
 And if you don't really, I don't give a fuck, nigga

 So catch me if you can 
 And if you ain't know, I don't really give a damn 
 Shout out to the girls in the club shakin' asses 
 Shout out to the hood 
 And with the furniture with plastic 
 Now we carry wads of the cash in the plastic 
 I got this whole shit mastered 
 And you know I'm the shit 
 And you know it don't matter whatchu think about, bitch 
 'Cause ain't nobody, ain't nobody, ain't nobody like me 
 Ladies askin' questions like; "Trigga one night, please"
