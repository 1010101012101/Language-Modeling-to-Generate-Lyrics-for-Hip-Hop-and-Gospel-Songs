All year round I'd be steady chasin' money 
 Gotta get it now can't let it get away from me 
 Restaurant food in my tummy 
 Oh, how I miss those home-cooked meals 
 Lobby calls 7 AM in the morning 
 Just got here from the club [...?] 
 Wishing that the world would stop spinnin' 
 Just for a day 
 Destiny awaits, she calls 
 Coming right away, I've learned 
 Looking back on the road that we lead, while we chasin' our dreams 
 We can't forget about the little things 
 There's a time to handle business 
 There's a time to get your grind 
 There's a time you must put it on the side 
 There's a time when you realize something's missing in your life 
 And that's the time you chill with the ones you love 
 The ones that you love 
 There's a time to handle business 
 There's a time to get your grind 
 There's a time you must put it on the side 
 There's a time when you realize something's missing in your life 
 And that's the time you chill with the ones you love 
 The ones that you love 
 Money, fame, and fortune is not worth losing it all 
 Love and happiness is so much more worth it all 
 So stop taking chances just for advances 
 'Cause you'll never know when times that aren't [...?] 
 There's so much more to life 
 There's a time to handle business 
 There's a time to get your grind 
 There's a time you must put it on the side 
 There's a time when you realize something's missing in your life 
 And that's the time you chill with the ones you love 
 The ones that you love 
 There's a time to handle business 
 There's a time to get your grind 
 There's a time you must put it on the side 
 There's a time when you realize something's missing in your life 
 And that's the time you chill with the ones you love 
 The ones that you love
