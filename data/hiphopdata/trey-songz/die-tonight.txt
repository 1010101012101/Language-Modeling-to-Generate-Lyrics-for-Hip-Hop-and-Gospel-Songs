My pride is gone, my heart is stoned 
 My days are long, and you don't understand that 
 My nights are cold, who do you call when you're alone? 
 And it's crazy, I'm thinkin' 'bout you baby 
 I know I said I wouldn't, but tell me how I couldn't miss the many fun times. 
 Baby this is one time that I see the world doesn't revolve around me, no. But why did I have to wait and see it the minute you left me? 
 Now everything is wrong, tell me where you've gone 
 Ya boy don't shed no tears 
 I'm not gon cry tonight, no, not tonight. 
 But it hurts like hell, heart broken times twelve 
 If another day without you hits, I just might die tonight, die tonight. 
 Now I ain't even been the kind of man to beat myself up over the past 
 But I can't help thinkin' if I just would've spent a little more time then we just wudda been better than we turned out 
 Or rather how I made us 
 Leavin' you with no doubt, forcin you to break up 
 But you really made me look at myself 
 I check my ego, baby I have confessed, that I see the world doesn't revolve around me, no no. But why did I have to wait and see it the minute you left me? 
 Now everything is wrong, tell me where you've gone 
 Ya boy don't shed no tears 
 I'm not gon cry tonight, no, not tonight. 
 But it hurts like hell, heart broken times twelve 
 If another day without you hits, I just might die tonight, die tonight. 
 Please don't let me, please don't let me, please don't let me die babe, die babe. 
 Don't let me, don't let me die babee
