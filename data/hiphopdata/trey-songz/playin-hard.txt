We just broke up this kinda new 
 I admit I'll still be right through 
 I heard you got another, 'nother 2 
 I've seen his Benz that 2009 
 Plus your homegirl I just fucked 
 'Cause she let all my friends hit 
 That's our subject I know fucking brain 
 The papers keep them judges tell 'em 
 Haters they some busters bad dude 
 Then I exit like I work out in publics 
 Got plenty girls so many girls 
 And pieces of me love it 
 But some pieces of me doesn't 
 Guess that's a players nature 
 Guess I holla at you later 
 Are you really done, I mean really done with me? 
 You said you will be here counting millions with me 
 Now you gone, my baby's gone you're gone 
 And I fall for you to come on home 
 I'm going crazy 
 But I can't act that, freshen up back 
 My cup is full of hennessy just me and my mentally 
 Windows down another two rollies 
 Where I'm 'bout to go I don't know 
 But I'm, but I'm sick of playing hard 
 I give up girl, sick of fighting this war 
 'Cause I'm losing if I'm losing you 
 Can't shake, heart break, can't fake baby wait 
 I'll say it, I admit it girl I've been a fool 
 Sick of playing hard, I'm sick of playing hard 
 I'm sick of playing hard but that's something that I can't help 
 I know these broads I've disgusted with my damn self 
 My back you would massage I miss how your hands felt 
 But the show's goes on, and this season left a bad low 
 Catch me in Miami puerto rican with a dance on 
 Talk is something sexy but I never understand her 
 Te amo mami but yo no se, I'm lonely mami I'm not ok 
 But I can't act that, freshen up back 
 My cup is full of hennessy just me and my mentally 
 Windows down another two rollies 
 Where I'm 'bout to go I don't know 
 But I'm, but I'm sick of playing hard 
 I give up girl, sick of fighting this war 
 'Cause I'm losing if I'm losing you 
 Can't shake, heart break, can't fake baby wait 
 I'll say it, I admit it girl I've been a fool 
 Sick of playing hard, I'm sick of playing hard 
 I'm so sick of frontin' like I don't miss you when you leave 
 And laying in bed at night you even sexy girl when you sleep 
 Feels a little crazy lying here alone 
 But I'm stuck on it, stuck on it 
 That I be on, that I be on 
 Any stunt, that got me smoking, driving, drinking girl 
 I'm tripping, blowing up your phone 
 But I'm, but I'm sick of playing hard 
 I give up girl, sick of fighting this war 
 'Cause I'm losing girl 
 Can't shake, heart break, can't fake baby wait 
 I'ma say it, I admit it girl I've been a fool 
 Sick of playing hard, I'm sick of playing hard 
 So uh 
 (Sick of playing hard) 
 Yeah I'm just 
 (Sick of playing hard) 
 Without you 
 Feels a little crazy 
 Yeah 
 Just, I just 
 I'm sick of playing hard
