U know it's been a minute since we really kicked it but I just want you to know

 Nope I can't say that everythings all bad 
 But I'm gon say that you be on my mind 
 How you doin' who you wit where you be at girl 
 We've had our share of ups and downs 
 But you know that I'm gon always be around 
 That's fo sho and you know how we do, how I roll 
 And remember ain't a damn thang changed 
 Holla if you need me, u always gon be my boo

 If you eva need me to be what you need girl I'm free 
 And forever you can holla at me

 I still be thinkin' 'bout the times we had 
 Don't wanna seem like I be missin' u 
 But I am and damn its bad girl 
 We've had our share of ups and downs 
 But you know that I'm gon always be around
