 (Trey) Talk about it nigga 
 (Trey verse) 
 There's never been a day that I 
 Felt the kinda way that I'm feelin' now 
 (I think my life done turned around, Yeah) 
 There's never been a girl that changed (that changed) 
 Changed the way I looked at things, oh I (I) 
 I swear I'm up and out the game 
 And I'm in it... 'cause 
 Girl 
 I'm walkin' different 
 Talkin' different 
 Thinkin' different 
 Baby girl my hustlin missin' 
 Touchin' Kissin' 
 Huggin' Listen 
 U got me lovin' trippin' 
 (Bhines verse) 
 Trey I know what you sayin' 
 I think I met the same chick 
 Does she have a tattoo of a bunny rabbit on her hip? 
 Matta fact I think she told about this R&B nigga' 
 I wasn't payin' attention 
 She was fine so I figured 
 I would pour some hennesey 
 And get her tispy where I want her 
 But little did I know she had me right where she want me 
 And now I'm wakin' up thinkin' I really put it down 
 She left me a note sayin' I'll see you around 
 Now I'm 
 Girl 
 I'm walkin' different 
 Talkin' different 
 Thinkin' different 
 Baby girl my hustlin missin' 
 Touchin' Kissin' 
 Huggin' Listen 
 U got me lovin' trippin' 
 (Bhines Bridge) 
 Woo, ooh 
 (How could I let myself get so caught up) I could I let it 
 (I know I got that work I'm like what the fuck) Wtfff... 
 Oh, she got me trippin' feelin' I'm in love 
 All because the way she gave it up 
 No whoa! 
 (Chorus) 2x w/adlibs
