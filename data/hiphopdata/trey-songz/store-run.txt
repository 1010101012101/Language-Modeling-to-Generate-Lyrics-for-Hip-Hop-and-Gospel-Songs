(Trey talking) 
 Songz 
 It's Songbook, baby. 
 Oh, oh, oh. Whoo. 
 Ride, ride, come and ride with the Prince. 
 Come ride, ride, ride, ride with the Prince. 
 Come ride, come ride, come ride. 
 Uh, let's go. 
 Friday night, and I'm home 
 Just chillin' on the sofa. 
 Relaxin, I'm so glad the week is over. 
 I got my remote. 
 Good sack of that green, 
 I'ma lean and smoke. 
 Goin' through my cell 
 For the number of a chick that I met last week 
 And her body ain't no joke. 
 She picked up on the first ring. 
 "What took you so long to call me? 
 Recognized your name and number 
 From the caller ID." 
 She said her room mate is gone 
 And she all alone. 
 Let me get your street address, 
 Let me get dressed, and hung up the phone. 
 And it's on. 
 She want it and I want it too 
 But I'm unprepared. 
 And we came so close to goin' raw dog that we both got scared. 
 And she said, "I ain't ready to have no babies." 
 Jumped up put my clothes back on. 
 I was just about to get some 
 Had to make a store run. 
 Store run 
 Pack of three up at the counter. 
 Store run 
 Be back in less than half an hour. 
 Store run 
 I need protection and I'm out 
 Wait for me, keep it warm 
 I had to make a store run. 
 Speedin', switchin' lanes, and I'm flyin, 
 And tryin' to get back to her 
 Before she changes her mind. 
 'Cause if I take too long, 
 She might put her clothes back on. 
 Henny in my system, 
 She tipsy on that Grey Goose. 
 It's obvious what she's tryna get into. 
 Top huggin' them curves (them curves) 
 Got a nigga like me at a loss for words. 
 I know she can tell that I'm wit it, 
 Wanna get it, while inside your tee 
 She can tell when I'm close to her. 
 She keep lickin' her lips, 
 She touchin and she grabbin. 
 Oh 
 I'ma throw her the bone. 
 I'ma give it to her all night long. 
 I want it bad, oh so bad. 
 But I know that it's wrong. 
 Here we go. 
 She want it and I want it too 
 But I'm unprepared. 
 And we came so close to goin' raw dog that we both got scared. 
 And then she said, "I ain't ready to have no babies." 
 Jumped up put my clothes back on. 
 I was just about to get some 
 Had to make a store run. 
 Store run 
 Pack of three up at the counter. 
 Store run 
 Be back in less than half an hour. 
 Store run 
 I need protection and I'm out 
 Wait for me, keep it warm 
 I had to make a store run. 
 All I could do is think of being inside you, 
 Drivin' like I'm up out of my mind. 
 Baby here I come. 
 And you can take your clothes back off. 
 Store run 
 Pack of three up at the counter. 
 Store run 
 Be back in less than half an hour. 
 Store run 
 I need protection and I'm out 
 Wait for me, keep it warm 
 I had to make a store run. 
 I know, I know 
 Shoulda thought of this before. 
 But who would've thought that we'd end up right on the kitchen floor? 
 I ain't ready to have no babies. 
 No ifs, ands, buts, or maybes. 
 I'm tryna keep it safe. 
 Girl ain't you heard of AIDS?
