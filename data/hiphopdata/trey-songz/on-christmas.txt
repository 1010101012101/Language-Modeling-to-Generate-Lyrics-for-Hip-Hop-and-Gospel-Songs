When it gets cold, I want to know 
 Who's going to keep me warm on Christmas? 
 Are you going to keep me warm on Christmas? 
 Who's going to keep me warm on Christmas? 
 It's the time of the year, holiday cheer 
 So why do I feel, so darn down 
 I need to get up, I need to get out 
 And get in the mood, so I 
 Just bought a tree but I don't wanna put it up, ooh 
 Walked passed the neighbors, see da windows lightin up, ooh 
 There's no one to kiss, under the mistletoe, and I'm so alone, ooh 
 When it gets cold, I want to know 
 Who's going to keep me warm on Christmas? 
 Are you going to keep me warm on Christmas? 
 Who's going to keep me warm on Christmas? 
 I wanna be, getting some love from a pretty young thing 
 After tonight we can eat right, I promise to do anything she like 
 When mama cookin she can come celebrate, (celebrate) 
 A special girl, that make me feel a special way, (special way) 
 Could it be you, I need a boo, to bring in the new year with me. 
 When it gets cold, I want to know 
 Who's going to keep me warm on Christmas? 
 Are you going to keep me warm on Christmas? 
 Who's going to keep me warm on Christmas? 
 She gotta be, so fine, one of a kind 
 She gotta be, special, and so beautiful 
 And she gotta be, all that I ever wanted for Christmas 
 That's the only gift I wanna receive, on Christmas 
 When it gets cold 
 When it gets cold, I want to know 
 Who's going to keep me warm on Christmas? 
 Are you going to keep me warm on Christmas? 
 Who's going to keep me warm on Christmas?
