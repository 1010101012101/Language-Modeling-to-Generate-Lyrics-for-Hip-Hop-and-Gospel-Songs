Sex ain't better than love 
 Sex ain't better than love 
 I been out here in theses street and I done learned 
 Every girl I gave my loving to 
 Was only a substitute 
 I been out here in these and I done learned 
 Even though she in my arm 
 This ain't where my heart belongs 
 Sex in the air 
 No loving here 
 Soon as I get through 
 I'm outta there 
 And it feels so bad 
 But it feels so good 
 Wishing I could care 
 Girl I never could 
 But then I fell into your love 
 Didn't even touch the ground 
 Now I see clear that your heart is there 
 All these other women they just can't compare 
 Girl I know sex ain't better than love 
 I been out here in these streets and I done learned that 
 Sex ain't better than love 
 I done seen it all, I done it all, so much better when you fall 
 Sex ain't better than love 
 Girl you been my teacher and I learned that 
 Sex ain't better than love 
 Sex ain't, sex ain't, sex ain't better than love 
 Feelings I thought that I would never have 
 Ooh I'm so open and I got it bad 
 I got you now and Imma make it last 
 She says my baby she can't wait to have 
 Love in the air 
 Never been so clear 
 So beautiful 
 Bring your body here 
 Let me fall into your love 
 I wanna hear the lovely sound 
 Let me take my time while we in this bed 
 You was made for me and I don't wanna share 
 Girl I know sex ain't better than love 
 I been out here in these streets and I done learned that 
 Sex ain't better than love 
 I done seen it all, I done it all, so much better when you fall 
 Sex ain't better than love 
 Girl you been my teacher and I learned that 
 Sex ain't better than love 
 Sex ain't, sex ain't, sex ain't better than love 
 Don't you ever leave 
 Baby girl I need need your love to breath 
 Never been so clear to me 
 I was blinded but now I see because 
 Girl I know sex ain't better than love 
 I been out here in these streets and I done learned that 
 Sex ain't better than love 
 I done seen it all, I done it all, so much better when you fall 
 Sex ain't better than love 
 Girl you been my teacher and I learned that 
 Sex ain't better than love 
 Sex ain't, sex ain't, sex ain't better than love
