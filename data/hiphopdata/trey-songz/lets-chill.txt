Ooh yeah

 Let's chill 
 I just wanna chill 
 Let's chill 
 Take you back to the crib 
 Give you something you can feel 
 Let's chill 
 From the dinner to the movie 
 Hop in that jacuzzi 
 Bring your body to me 
 You're always used to seeing me cheating in the club 
 With the video models plus the bottles yeah a lotta that 
 Tonight I could care less bout where the party at 
 Alot of numbers in my phone but you the one I'm a holla at 
 Numbers we exchange like money be my pussy ronnie won't you holla back? 
 Not only your body that face could embrace any cover of the... 
 Ain't no body like you thinking I should wife you

 She say I'm a playa you jst want me for the night boo 
 Well that might true but I like you 
 Then she smile boy you wild I'm a fight you 
 Rocka-by-baby when the beat drops 
 Don't let your friends know we gonna creep off 
 They gonna be haters tell 'em cya later 
 Just want us to be alone so...

 Amerie: 
 Now I be chillin' in this club for awhile 
 But these hood chasing scalywag dudes ain't my style 
 So I'm thinking I'm a take it home call it a night 
 When I look over to the left and see something I like 
 Keep it down sexy now even cut them breads 
 Cuff right out to the chest look me in my face 
 And all I want is you and I'm wanting him to give me something I can feel
