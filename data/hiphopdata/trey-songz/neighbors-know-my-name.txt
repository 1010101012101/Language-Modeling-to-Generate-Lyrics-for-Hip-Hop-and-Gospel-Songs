Soon as we get started makin' love goin' harder hear a... (knock knock) knocking on the wall, 
 And as soon as I go deep getting it in then again there's a... (knock knock) knocking on the wall, 
 Girl your legs keep shakin I swear we breakin our new headboard headboard 
 And the love we make it feels so good girl you know I'm proud lookin' in your lovely face scream my name you do it so loud

 And I know you're so excited if you bite it they won't hear 
 And you know jus what we capable of, when we makin' love 
 So the music gone be loud, you gone scream and shout 
 Girl your bodys a problem, they call me the problem solver 
 Let the phone sit on the charger, it could ring all night 
 They can call, they can knock, and be upset, but I bet

 While they dreamin', you be screamin now they bangin' on our door 
 Sometimes she call me Trey, sometimes she say Tremaine 
 When it's all said and done but the neighbors know my name 
 Sometimes she call me trigga 'cause I make her body blush
