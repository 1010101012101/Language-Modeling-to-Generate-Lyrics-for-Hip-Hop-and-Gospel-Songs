I never had time for you 
 Spending my nights, caught in that life 
 The hell am I supposed to do 
 When everything wrong, feels so right 
 I, been losing the fight with my ego 
 Girl to the right won't let me go 
 Making it hard on a n**** 
 To look away and turn it down 
 And I've been drinking way too much (way too much) 
 To be thinking about love (to be thinking about love) 
 To be thinking about us (to be thinking about us) 
 So I'ma pour another cup 
 And I can't leave this club alone (leave tha club alone) 
 So it ain't about trust 
 I got a reputation 
 Good or bad, so what, I gotta keep it up 
 I've been living my life in these clubs 
 I've been giving my life to these girls 
 The bright lights like drugs 
 The fast life don't slow up 
 I know I know I know I know 
 I know, I know (I get it) 
 I know, I know, I know I know 
 I know, yeah, I know, yeah 
 I've been living my life in these clubs 
 I've been giving my life to these girls 
 The bright lights like drugs 
 The fast life don't slow up 
 I know I know I know I know 
 I know, I know (I get it) 
 I know, I know, I know I know 
 I know, yeah, I know, yeah 
 There's some things I can't get back 
 It's some things I can't get back 
 I know, I know, I know, I know 
 There's some things I can't get back 
 I know, I know, I know, I know 
 There's some things I can't get back 
 If you're looking for love, you won't find it here 
 I've had my share of that life 
 But I never have time to give 
 'Cause I always spread myself thin 
 I'm Losing the fight with my ego 
 It's like you won't let me go 
 And you're making it hard on a n**** 
 To look away and turn it down 
 And I've been drinking way too much (way too much) 
 To be thinking about love (to be thinking about love) 
 To be thinking about us (to be thinking about us) 
 So Ima pour another cup 
 And I can't leave this club alone (leave tha club alone) 
 So it ain't about trust
