Trey speaking: 
 You know sometimes in life 
 When you, when you're going through things 
 You're having problems 
 You just wanna know how to live that 
 Let the top back ride with a beautiful woman, you know what I mean 
 I know some of you are like: fuck no 
 I know what you mean and I can feel that but ay 
 Ridin' to the music 
 This is how we do it all night 
 Breezin down the freeway 
 Just me and my baby 
 In our ride 
 Just me and my boss 
 No worries at all 
 Listening to aston martin music, music 
 Girl I would have came back for you 
 I just needed time to do what I had to do 
 Caught in the life I can't let it go 
 Whether that's right 
 I will never know 
 Should I go back to the woman 
 That had my back at the moment 
 Before the moment when everybody else got on it 
 What if I was stuck in the hood 
 Rolling skinny blunts 
 Doin' hand to hands 
 Baby seats and strollers in my mini van 
 Who the fuck am I kiddin' 
 This how I'm livin' 
 Different cities every day 
 Boy you know is different women 
 See I'm growing as a business 
 And I'm sitting on some millions 
 Missing Thanksgivings 
 Got the bank flippin 
 You don't understand my reality is different 
 Addicted to this life yet life's what's missin' 
 Yeah, let that manifest man I'm just in another world ridin' with you girl 
 Ridin' to the music 
 This is how we do it all night 
 Breezin down the freeway 
 Just me and my baby 
 In our ride 
 Just me and my boss 
 No worries at all 
 Listening to aston martin music, music 
 I would have came back for you 
 I just needed time to do what I (got a lot of shit going on) had to do 
 Caught in the life I can't let it go 
 Whether that's right 
 I will never know 
 And listen I figure it's only right 
 That I been getting to this money 
 'Cause I feel like for so long 
 They have been trying keep it from me 
 So many different women 
 Tell me that they love me 
 I just tell them keep it from me 
 'Cause that picture could get ugly 
 Passionate as ever but my heart is tough as leather 
 See the pain in tremaine 
 Sometimes bury the pleasure 
 But whatever 
 Cheddar, I was raised be about it 
 Say you can't leave with it 
 But I can't be without it 
 Yeah I think that I'm the shit all the time 
 If you don't then do you that's some shit you need to get off your mind 
 You don't think that you're the shit can't sit in my ride 
 That's why I keep a bad bitch in the ride 
 Ridin' to the music 
 This is how we do it all night 
 Breezin down the freeway 
 Just me and my baby 
 In our ride 
 Just me and my boss 
 No worries at all 
 Listening to aston martin music, music 
 I would have came, would have came (yes I would) back for you 
 I just needed time (I wanted time, wanted time) to do what I had to do 
 Caught in the life (caught in the life) I can't let it go 
 Whether that's right 
 I will never know 
 But here goes nothing 
 Aston martin music, music 
 Aston martin music, music 
 Aston martin music, music
