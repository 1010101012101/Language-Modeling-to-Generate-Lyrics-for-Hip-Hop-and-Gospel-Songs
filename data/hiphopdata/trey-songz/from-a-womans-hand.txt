(Verse One) 
 Tell me why when you put a camera on a thug 
 The first thing out of his mouth 
 Is I wanna thank my mama 
 And some say that causes drama 
 But its subliminal 
 There's no efforts needed 
 It's like pouring water on the ground that already seeded 
 And you know it happens all the time 
 So Ineed to ask this question 
 Why oh why is it hard for dudes to always be around 
 Tell me how can a boy be a man 
 Only getting fed from a woman's hands 
 Tell me what do you think will happen 
 When you don't come around 
 It's gonna be hard for a boy to be a man 
 Only getting fed from a woman's hand 
 (Verse Two) 
 Now tell me what turns a boy into a thug 
 Just as soon as he leave the house 
 See he don't have a man to give him little rules 
 So he don't running in and out 
 But it's okay 'cause mamas there 
 And mamas doing the best that she could ever do 
 But the funny thing is when it's all said and done 
 She probably did it better than you can ever do 
 Why oh why is it hard for dudes to always be around 
 Tell me how can a boy be a man 
 Only getting fed from a woman's hand 
 Tell me what do you think will happen 
 When you don't come around 
 Its gonan be hard for a boy to be a man 
 Only getting fed from a woman's hand 
 (Verse Three) 
 Tell me how will a boy learn to stand on his own 
 How can he make it all alone 
 How can he be responsible 
 If he don't have his daddy to show him how to be there 
 Not to minimize what his mama does for him 
 I'm just saying he gone need y'all both 
 Can you tell me why why why 
 Does it gotta be so hard to do a daddy job 
 It's gonna be hard for a boy to be man 
 Why oh why is it hard for dudes to always be around 
 Tell me how can a boy be a man 
 Only getting fed from a woman's hand 
 Tell me what do you think will happen 
 When you don't come around 
 Its gonan be hard for a boy to be a man 
 Only getting fed from a woman's hand 
 Why oh why is it hard for dudes to always be around 
 Tell me how can a boy be a man 
 Only getting fed from a woman's hand 
 Tell me what do you think will happen 
 When you don't come around 
 Its gonan be hard for a boy to be a man 
 Only getting fed from a woman's hand 
 When you missin' his first game 
 Don't even know the boy nickname 
 That's a damn shame 
 You supposed to be the man the daddy the father 
 The boys role model 
 That's supposed to be you
