Hit me spray, hit me spray 
 Hit me spray, hit me spray. 
 I was ... when I got a call, 
 From my girl that I ...in the morn' 
 She was talking about breaking me off, 
 And I'm just hurt today what I'ma supost to say, no 
 When I'm gonna turn it down, she was the queen that wore the crown, 
 So I asked her what she want from me, 
 She whispered softly, hit me spray. 
 Girl I give you what you say, hit me spray, 
 I can tell you really wanna play, hit me spray 
 Playin' with that naked game, hit me spray, 
 With you ... you don't have to spray. 
 Girl I give you what you say, hit me spray, 
 I can tell you really wanna play, hit me spray 
 Playin' with that naked game, hit me spray, 
 With you ... you don't have to spray. 
 That's to my ... who can put it down, 
 I know it, ... I'll but we can both crown, 
 Girl honest we can play all day, oh 
 ...If it ain't came my way, oh 
 When a girl like that, how can I say no, (no, no, no) 
 ...And vogue 
 No I never hurt an ass like that before, 
 Tooking ...way, if you won't let me to spray. 
 Girl I give you what you say, hit me spray, 
 I can tell you really wanna play, hit me spray 
 Playin' with that naked game, hit me spray, 
 With you ... you don't have to spray. 
 Girl I give you what you say, hit me spray, 
 I can tell you really wanna play, hit me spray 
 Playin' with that naked game, hit me spray, 
 With you ... you don't have to spray. 
 She says she ... with me in the rainy days, 
 She will do anything I want to make a spray 
 If my heart is going down, she like to play it round, 
 She can really be a saint if I make a spray. 
 Hit me spray, hit me spray 
 Hit me spray, hit me spray.
