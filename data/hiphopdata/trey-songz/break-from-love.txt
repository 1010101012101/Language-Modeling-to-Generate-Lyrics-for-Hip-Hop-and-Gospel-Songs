I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us 
 I don't want to break, I don't want to break from us 
 After all we've been through, so much, woah 
 I don't want to break, I don't want to break from love 
 You called me, I tried to shake the other night 
 In a hurry, guess you didn't have the time 
 To wait on my broken promises 
 I saw you, the reason with no rhyme 
 We tried to work it out, we tried way back when 
 Your heart was spilling over without an end 
 I hurt you once before, I hurt you again 
 You lost the faith that you had, had trusted in 
 So I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us 
 I don't want to break, I don't want to break from us 
 After all we've been through, so much, woah 
 I don't want to break, I don't want to break from love 
 A break from love 
 A break from love 
 This journey will have its ups and downs 
 Sustaining will last a test of trial 
 This burning will only last a while 
 First degree burns don't leave scars 
 We can turn this pain around 
 We tried to work it out, we tried way back when (way back when) 
 Your heart was spilling over without an end (without an end) 
 I hurt you once before, I hurt you again (again and again) 
 You lost the faith that you had, had trusted in (yeah, trusted in) 
 So I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us 
 I don't want to break, I don't want to break from us 
 After all we've been through, so much, woah 
 I don't want to break, I don't want to break from love 
 A break from love 
 A break from love 
 A break from love 
 A break from love
