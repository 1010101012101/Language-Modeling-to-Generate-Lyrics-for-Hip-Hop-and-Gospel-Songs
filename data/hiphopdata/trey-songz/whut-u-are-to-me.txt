Now shorty gurl you like bail money 
 When I'm locked down in the jail honey 
 Ya set me free and I need that 
 The other half of me gurl you be dat 
 Gurl I need for you to know this 
 See imma keep you warm in the coldest 
 Whether you can dream a 
 Baby you my dream love

 Do you understand jus whut ya are to me gurl 
 Baby you're the air I breathe
