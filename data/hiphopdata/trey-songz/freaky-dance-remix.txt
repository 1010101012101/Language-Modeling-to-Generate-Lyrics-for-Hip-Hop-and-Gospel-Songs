Lyrics to I Like Dat (Freak Freaky Dance) / Trey Songz 
 (Feat. Swizz Beatz) 
 I need about every thing at bar

 About everything at the bar 
 Come on the party starts

 This gone make you get up off your ass 
 Right now right now this gone make you get up off your ass 
 Right now now now here we go all my ladies in the place with the real hair 
 Were you at were you at hit the dance floor

 Hey ho I like dat hey ho I like dat 
 Wait a minute all my fellas in the back 
 Were you at all my fellas in the back

 Put your motherfucking cups in the air 
 Hey ho I like dat hey ho I like dat hey ho I like dat

 At you belong on the runway 
 Just like the models I ain't talkin' where the planes 
 Ain't takin' flight at girl you make me wanna sing 
 Or something take you home tryna get you outta them jeans 
 Or something your sex make your ass wanna finea 
 Or something your straight you ain't gone never finea 
 For something the way you do your freaky dance

 On your feelin' on your butt get a lil take a lil show a lil love

 Hey look shawty don't be mad I'm just joking now 
 Your waist is so small ass poking out there 
 Something in my pants think you outta know

 Ay you know what I do to you when nobody around 
 But just be cool you know everybody watching 
 Now you got a man he a fool when he's not around 
 Ay here my number you can hit me when he's not in town 
 When you need something holla you know I got it now 
 High yellow light brown pretty long hair

 Ay how you stay so thick when you so thin tight

 Brought no friends well what you never tell for let's go 
 All my ladies in the place with the real hair

 Were you at all my fellas in the back 
 Were you at if you don't care like we don't care 
 Put your motherfucking cups in the air 
 Hey ho I like dat hey ho I like dat hey ho I like dat
