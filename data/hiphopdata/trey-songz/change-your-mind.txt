Pretty, pretty girls all around the world 
 Pretty, pretty girls all around the world 
 I know that what you heard ain't fly 
 'Cause people gone say shit 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 No difference from all of these women 
 But do you believe it 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Ain't by chance that we're here 
 Only got one life to live, so 
 Let me change your mind 
 They say that I'm bad for you that's fine 
 Sometimes bad is a good time 
 Don't you be shy 
 Let me change your mind 
 Can't never have a one night only 
 But you don't need to be lonely 
 Come get to know me 
 Let me change your mind 
 Your mind, your mind 
 Your mind, your mind 
 Your mind, your mind 
 Let me change your mind 
 Your mind, your mind 
 Your mind, your mind 
 Your mind, your mind 
 Let me change your mind 
 I feel you 
 But it won't kill you 
 So let me get near you 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Your lipstick eat my kisses 
 So baby stop tripping 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Ain't by chance that we're here, girl 
 Only got one life to live, so 
 Let me change your mind 
 They say that I'm bad for you that's fine 
 Sometimes bad is a good time 
 Don't you be shy 
 Let me change your mind 
 Can't never have a one night only 
 But you don't need to be lonely 
 Come get to know me 
 Let me change your mind 
 Your mind, your mind 
 Your mind, your mind 
 Your mind, your mind 
 Let me change your mind
