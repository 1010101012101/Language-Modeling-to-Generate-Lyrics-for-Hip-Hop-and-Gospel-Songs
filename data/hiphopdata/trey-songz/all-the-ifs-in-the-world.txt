(Verse One) 
 It's still ringing in my ear 
 You screamin' out of here 
 And I can see it like it just went down 
 You walking out of there 
 I still see 'em on your face baby 
 So many tears 
 And I remember feeling like I'm bout to explode 
 I gotta get out of here 
 It's like my sun won't shine 
 It's like my ride don't roll 
 It's like the only one thing I love 
 Don't love me no more 
 It's like my right went wrong 
 It's like my ice gone warm 
 It's like the only one thing I love 
 Don't love me no more 
 If I had just slacked up on my pimping 
 You'd be here with me 
 If I'd a stayed instead of dipping 
 You'd be here with me 
 If I'd a prayed instead of wishing 
 You'd still be here with me 
 But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again 
 (Verse Two) 
 I wish that I could run that back 
 But in life you can't press rewind 
 'Cause the only way to fix this thang 
 Is to go back in time 
 'Cause if I had my way 
 Yesterday would be right now 
 Instead of fighting we'd be making love 
 Until the sun go down 
 It's like my sun won't shine 
 It's like my ride don't roll 
 It's like the only one thing I love 
 Don't love me no more 
 It's like my right went wrong 
 It's like my ice gone warm 
 It's like the only one thing I love 
 Don't love me no more 
 If I had just slacked up on my pimping 
 You'd be here with me 
 If I'd a stayed instead of dipping 
 You'd still be here with me 
 If I'd a prayed instead of wishing 
 You'd still be here with me 
 But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again 
 If I had just slacked up on my pimping 
 You'd be here with me 
 If I'd a stayed instead of dipping 
 You'd still be here with me 
 If I'd a prayed instead of wishing 
 You'd still be here with me 
 But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again 
 (Verse Three) 
 If I could just hold my shawty 
 If I could kiss my shawty 
 If I could get my shawty back 
 If I could just see you baby 
 If we could talk then baby 
 I would have my lady back 
 If I had just slacked up on my pimping 
 You'd be here with me 
 If I'd a stayed instead of dipping 
 You'd still be here with me 
 If I'd a prayed instead of wishing 
 You'd still be here with me 
 But all the ifs in the world won't bring you back again 
 It's like my sun won't shine 
 It's like my ride don't roll 
 It's like the only one thing I love 
 Don't love me no more 
 It's like my right went wrong 
 It's like my ice gone warm 
 It's like the only one thing I love 
 Don't love me no more
