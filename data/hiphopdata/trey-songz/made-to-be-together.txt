(Talking) 
 Songz. 
 [Jim Jones:] Jones, 
 Songbook, baby. 
 And my boy E. Hud. 
 You already know... 
 I'm so, you so, we so fly. [x8] 
 Listen, 
 Maybe it's the dude, 
 Maybe it's the cool. 
 Maybe it's my shoes, 
 Call 'em 22's. 
 Baby it's your waist, 
 Baby it's your face. 
 Baby it's your smile, 
 Make me wonder how you taste. 
 Maybe 'cause the thugs say that I'm cool. 
 Maybe 'cause the girls wanna be like you. 
 Maybe it's the ice that made you look twice. 
 Maybe it's your back that made me look back. 
 Baby I look good with you. 
 You should know that you look good with me too. (true) 
 Let me ride through the hood with you, 
 And show you to my boys 'cause ooh, ooh you. 
 You so fly, I'm so fly, 
 What's mo' fly than you and I together? 
 Get high, let's fly together. 
 Oh, girl. 
 I'm so fly, you so fly, 
 What's mo' fly than you and I together? 
 Get high, let's fly together. 
 Whoo! 
 Maybe take a cruise, 
 Sail across seas. 
 We could never lose, 
 Baby not we. 
 We could be the two, 
 The life of the party. 
 Baby what it do? 
 You know that you want me. 
 Maybe is the feel that I like you. 
 Got a nigga feel he gon' wife you, 
 Maybe it's the fit that made me look slick. 
 Baby you the pick, 
 I make you my chick. 
 Baby I look good with you. 
 You should know that you look good with me too. (true) 
 Let me ride through the hood with you, 
 And show you to my boys 'cause ooh, ooh you. 
 You so fly, I'm so fly, 
 What's mo' fly than you and I together? 
 Get high, let's fly together. 
 Oh, girl. 
 I'm so fly, you so fly, 
 What's mo' fly than you and I together? 
 Get high, let's fly together. 
 Whoo! 
 Baby don't, 
 Don't you take too long. 
 I want you in my arms. 
 And if you feel what I feel 
 Bring it here to me, 
 C'mon. 
 See we young, but girl we grown. 
 And baby I wanna grow old 
 With you 'cause you know that you so... 
 (Jim Jones Rap) 
 Well maybe it's ya attitude that makes me a lil mad at you 
 (Uh huh) 
 The same time the gratitude make me wanna spend cash on you, 
 (Uh huh) 
 Take you on trips cross the longitude and latitude 
 (Uh huh) 
 Let you hold the whip, last time we almost crashed the Coupe. 
 (Whoo!) 
 So I laughed at you 'cause we was drunk pissy. 
 It was two summers ago, that was the summer with Miami. 
 But maybe it's the loyalty, they way that you callin me. 
 Where we makin' love and you scream, "put it all on me." 
 Or maybe my physique and my upcoming from the streets. 
 It keeps you runnin' back and got you cummin in the sheets. 
 From the first time I met you, you've become a lil freak. 
 I might go downtown and get somethin' to eat. 
 And baby you take care of me, baby I'll take care of you. 
 You cry, I cry, baby I shed tears for two. 
 Baby if that 7 Carat didn't cost 300 grand, 
 I wouldn't have to tell you put some ice on ya hand, 
 Just joking. 
 You so fly, I'm so fly, 
 What's mo' fly than you and I together? 
 Get high, let's fly together. 
 Oh, girl. 
 I'm so fly, you so fly, 
 What's mo' fly than you and I together? 
 Get high, let's fly together. 
 Whoo! 
 I'm so, you so, we so fly. [x5] 
 Oh, girl.
