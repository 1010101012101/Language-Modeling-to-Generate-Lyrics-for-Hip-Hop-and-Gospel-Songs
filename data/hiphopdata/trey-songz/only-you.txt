 Comes in ova Trey "oh-No" 
 I'm like pookie in new jack 
 Clinked up with the roof back 
 On the otha side of the tracks I produce shit 
 Still a feen no less 
 For the green I just 
 Do a thing I guess 
 Brings out my best 
 Brings out my worst 
 Its da gift and the curse 
 No one said it would be easy 
 Livin' this worth 
 And its hard not to style the enoge 
 Fuck ya nodge when them benz door lift up from 
 The floor 
 Every night fake willies wanna match ya bar 
 But I'm far... outta reach like Abdul-Jabar 
 I'm so into this life you know who I r {I'm givin' 
 U all of me} 
 Every corner every hood... ghetto superstars 
 {Yeah yeah} 
 {Yeah yeah} 
 {Yeah yeah} 
 {Yeah yeah}
