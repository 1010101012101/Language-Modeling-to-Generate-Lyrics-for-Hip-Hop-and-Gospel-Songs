Girl you so beautiful 
 I love the way you feel inside 
 But I don't want you to think 
 I just want your body 
 I want all of you, of you 
 I don't nobody but you, no 
 Just want your body 
 I want all of you 
 Oh, oh, oh 
 Sweat dripping off your body 
 I feel, I feel, I feel good 
 Ain't nothing better than being inside 
 Girl you know, girl you know very well 
 So, deep inside, deep inside your love 
 Deep inside 
 Oh, oh, oh
