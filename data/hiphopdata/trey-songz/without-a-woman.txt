Picture this coming home from a long day's work, no food is left 
 Picture this steady trying to show the world of your worth, and nobody cares 
 Picture this no kissing, ain't no touching, there's no hugging 
 And in the evening no good loving 
 Ain't no pretty picture you can paint 
 Ain't no way this life would be the same 
 I'm telling you a boy can't be a man without a woman 
 And you can try as hard as you can, but we ain't nothing without a woman 
 Living in a world so cold, so cold 
 The fire burns through my soul, without a woman 
 What if you had no hands to rub upon your shoulders 
 And in the morning she's not there to fix your rogers 
 You're sick as a dog right now 
 Kids running all around that house 
 No one to help you out 
 Picture this you pen these bills all 'bout yourself 
 No one to tell you watch you health 
 But keep it girl, you might as well 
 Picture this 'cause your world don't spin without her 
 And hers won't spin without you 
 Ain't no pretty picture you can paint 
 Ain't no way this life would be the same 
 I'm telling you a boy can't be a man without a woman 
 And you can try as hard as you can, but we ain't nothing without a woman 
 Living in a world so cold, so cold 
 The fire burns through my soul, without a woman 
 Say hello to pain, goodbye to love 
 Hello to rain the sun will never shine again 
 There'll be no Wednesday all nights 
 No make-ups after fights 
 Girl I'll make it right 
 I'm lonely with my pillow 
 Your car's not in the drive way 
 Clothes ain't in the closet 
 Girl I'm broken hearted 
 Come and find me 'cause I'm lost without my woman 
 And I know that a man can't be a man without a woman 
 You can try hard as you can 
 But you won't be nothing without a woman 
 Living in a world so cold, so cold 
 The fire burns through my soul, without a woman 
 See that life ain't life 
 And living ain't living 
 Without my woman 
 Hurting inside 
 Without my woman no, no, no
