I be like; YUP! 
 U would say what's up [? ] 
 Aye, girl, what's up [? ] 
 U rep what's up 
 Hey, what's up to Paris, 
 'Cause I be up in the Hilton feelin' good 
 White robe on, but I'm still so hood, with the slippers 
 Drinkin' out the minibar 
 Even though they hella charge 
 Baby, I'm cool on the paper 
 A fool with the paper 
 I could fuck around && start a school with the paper 
 Doo-doo on haters 
 Here's what I'm a do with the paper 
 I could bless u 
 Like hot shoes, Trey, drape ya 
 U could be my boo 
 U so cute with no makeup 
 (Wait, hold up) 
 Wait up 
 (Is thatis that) 
 Is that makeup? 
 Ok, it's koo u a full B 
 Do you use me? 
 Rock that doubie, girl 
 I ain't tryna mess up ya style 
 So I'm a ride with the whip slowed down 
 I got the whip slowed down 
 Windows down 
 This song shine 
 It's so loud 
 And baby it's 9 if you ask 'bout the clouds 
 I'm so high don't wanna come down 
 Don't wanna come down 
 Don't wanna come down 
 Don't wanna come down 
 Don't wanna come down 
 I'm so high don't wanna come down 
 Why would I want to? 
 Baby I want to, 
 Fly you somewhere like Jamaica, Barbados 
 Ok, Barbados 
 (Oh) 
 U say tomata, I say tomato 
 I wanna rub on you like some Play-Doh 
 Baby, ya body's stacked just like some Legos 
 I wanna G-u-n it 
 (Gun it) 
 No 50 cent, no Eminen, no Tony Yayo 
 Whatchu say tho? 
 ... [? ] 
 I'm Mark Anthony && your JLo... with a halo 
 Do ya thing 
 Flap your wings 
 U got feather, I got leather 
 He could tip u 
 I could weather the storm 
 It's gone 
 So I'm a let the top down while I got the whip slowed down 
 I got the whip slowed down 
 Windows down 
 This song shine 
 It's so loud 
 And baby it's 9 if you ask 'bout the clouds 
 I'm so high don't wanna come down 
 Don't wanna come down 
 Don't wanna come down 
 Don't wanna come down 
 Don't wanna come down 
 I'm so high don't wanna come down
