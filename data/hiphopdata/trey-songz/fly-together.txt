(Chorus : Trey Songz) 
 You so fly, I'm so fly, 
 What's more fly than you and I together, 
 Get high lets fly together, 
 I'm so fly, you so fly, 
 What's more fly than you and I together, 
 Get high lets fly together 
 (Verse 1 : Trey Songz) 
 Maybe it's the dude, maybe it's the cool 
 Maybe it's my shoes, call 'em 22's 
 Baby its ya phase, baby its ya face, 
 Baby its ya smile make me wonder how you taste, 
 Maybe cause the thugs say that I'm cool, 
 Maybe cause the girls wanna be like you, 
 Maybe it's the ice that made ya look twice, 
 Maybe its ya back that made me look back, 
 Baby I look good with you, 
 She know that you look good with me too, 
 Let me ride through the hood with you, 
 Show you to my boys cause ooh ooh you 
 (Chorus : Trey Songz) 
 You so fly, I'm so fly, 
 What's more fly than you and I together, 
 Get high lets fly together, 
 I'm so fly, you so fly, 
 What's more fly than you and I together, 
 Get high lets fly together 
 (Verse 2 : Trey Songz) 
 Maybe take a cruise, sail across seas, 
 We can never lose, baby not we, 
 We can be the two true life of the party, 
 Baby what it do you know that you want me, 
 Maybe it's the feel that I like you, 
 Got a nigga feel he can wife you, 
 Maybe it's the fit that made me look slick, 
 Baby you the pick I make you my chick 
 Baby I look good with you, 
 She know that you look good with me too, 
 Let me ride through the hood with you, 
 Show you to my boys cause ooh ooh you, 
 (Chorus : Trey Songz) 
 You so fly, I'm so fly, 
 What's more fly than you and I together, 
 Get high lets fly together, 
 I'm so fly, you so fly, 
 What's more fly than you and I together, 
 Get high lets fly together 
 (Verse 3 : Trey Songz) 
 Baby don't, don't you take too long, 
 I want you in my arms, 
 If you feel what I feel bring it here to me c'mon 
 See we young but girl we grown, 
 And baby I want to grow old, 
 With you cause you know that you so 
 (Verse 4 : Jim Jones) 
 Maybe its ya attitude that makes me a little mad at you, 
 The same time the gratitude that make one spend cash on you, 
 Take you on trips you caught the longitude and latitude, 
 Let you hold the whip last time we almost crashed the coupe, 
 So I laughed at you, 'cause we was drunk pissy, 
 It was 2 summers ago and you still rollin' wit me, 
 But maybe it's the loyalty, the way that you callin' me, 
 When we makin' love when you scream put it all on me, 
 Or maybe my physique and my upcoming from the streets, 
 I keep you running back, I got you coming in the sheets, 
 From the first time I met you you become a little freak, 
 I might go downtown and get something to eat, 
 And baby you took care of me baby I took care of you, 
 You cry I cry, baby I should tears for two, 
 Baby if the 7 karats didn't cost 300 grand, 
 I would had the table and put some ice in ya hand 
 (Chorus : Trey Songz) 
 You so fly, I'm so fly, 
 What's more fly than you and I together, 
 Get high lets fly together, 
 Baby can we fly together, 
 I'm so fly, you so fly, 
 What's more fly than you and I together, 
 Get high lets fly together
