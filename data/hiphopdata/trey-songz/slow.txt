Aw girl- I know you ain't never met G's like us before 
 Never smoked trees like that before- tonight 
 Aw girl- we ain't gotta wait here to long 
 Chevy out front, 22's on 
 Any drink you done had I got that at home- so 
 Said you wanted me to beat it up 
 Shit, Imma beat it up 
 Baby girl what the deal, we gone get way heated up 
 My key in your ignition- pop the clutch and get to stickin' 
 (Hold on, baby before you speed it up go slow) 
 Go slow 
 (She aid the, slower you go, the slower the flow, the slower you go, it's more sex to go) 
 Slow 
 (The slower you go, the slower the flow) 
 You got more sex to go 
 Girl- my imaginations crazy, and your such a beautiful lady 
 I can see me inside you now 
 Oh girl- so slow (girl) 
 I role (girl) 
 But when I proceed to speed the tempo (girl) 
 Brace yourself Imma keep your feet up 
 Said you wanted me to beat it up 
 Rap: 
 Would you mind if I rap this 
 I'm quite good at this 
 Not the rappin', baby the ass tappin 
 Plus the fact is that I will love smashin 
 Damn baby excuse the verb fashion 
 See what I mean is you was the word smashin 
 And what I dream, is you and me had passion 
 Ya fascinated with mad sweat sex 
 I ain't doin' my job if you ain't wet yet 
 She said I'm wet as I can get 
 And she ain't trippin' on my fashion in verb 
 Said she tends to like a lil more action than words 
 Said she wanted me to beat it up, skeet it up, right after the show, but I gotta go slow
