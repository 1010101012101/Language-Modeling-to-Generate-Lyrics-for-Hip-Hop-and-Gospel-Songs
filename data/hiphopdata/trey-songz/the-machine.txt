Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Guessin this is the part where I start 
 Telling you I wanna tear your body all apart 
 Beatin' all day like your heart 
 Come here can I park 
 This spot so perfect 
 Cut 'em all off 'cause you so worth it 
 You said you left him 'cause he made you feel worthless 
 And you were scared 'cause I made you so nervous 
 Well lets play it like you never heard the radio 
 Or seen the TV 
 See me for me 
 She smiled touchin my chest 
 Trigga you a mess 
 Baby I'm for real 
 She said you better be 
 Baby I'm so for real you can go ask heavy d 
 Speakin' of heavy d 
 Think ya can lift that 
 Game in the bag but they forgot to gift wrap 
 Blame me for never givin' into the rift raft 
 Turned into a machine all I'm seein is pitch black 
 They ain't never gunna stop me 
 Never forget that 
 All they can do is watch me like eyelids peeled back 
 Everything I'm sayin' you should know that I meant that 
 Baby girl tell them that I'm fresh as a mint pack 
 Tic Tac breath strips 
 Where we going breast slip 
 Tongue kiss 
 Married to the melody 
 Sleeping with the drum kick 
 Tell the hi hat hit when I say so 
 Rearrange beats track got made over 
 When the sun rise I just got a day colder 
 Beats like food after I pray over 
 Turn the prey over 
 Got great molars 
 Time to wake the world up 
 Call me Trey Folgers! 
 Trey told ya 
 Take over 
 So cold I can freeze the great lakes over 
 Order me a cold beer 
 I ain't talkin' number 8 
 Talkin' well done wild goose stake 
 Get a plate 
 Ya ain't never heard of that 
 Yeah that boy murdered that 
 She says she my baby tell me where the gerber at 
 And don't speak a word of that 
 Gerber rap 
 Not havin' a damn thing to do with any word of that (Songz!) 
 Baby this songz 
 We can get gone 
 Like Ideal I'm ireel 
 What I feel 
 I'm one of the realest 
 Don't know what ya dealin' with 
 I can call bluffs and count cards 
 Dealin' with a sane man 
 Tremaine rainman 
 Workin out all the potholes out my gameplan 
 It's a lot of pressure havin' money and fame and 
 It started as a dream 
 Now it's all about the cream 
 You can call me the machine 
 Call me the machine 
 Gon call me the machine 
 Call me the machine 
 Yeah call me the machine 
 Shawty get ya maballine 
 'Cause we bout to make a scene 
 Hop in that machine 
 You can roll with the machine 
 Moneys in my jeans 
 Imma a money fiend 
 I put that on everything 
 That I'm chasin every dream 
 Call me the machine (chine chine chine chine) 
 Call me the machine 
 Triggered a machine 
 Damn right imma machine 
 I dedicate this to the king 
 Moo what up 
 Eh 
 I dedicate this to my homie in the feds 
 He told me I gotta work harder than I ever worked before 
 Eh 
 No problem nigga 
 I gotcha 
 Come here 
 Come here 
 Lemme herd that 
 Eh lemme herd that 
 Run it back
