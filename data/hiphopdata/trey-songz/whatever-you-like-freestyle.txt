(Intro: Talking - Trey Songz) 
 Yuupp! 
 I'm a tell you right now, nothing is safe! 
 Let's go, Songz (Songz), That right! (That right) 
 They gon' have to wait 'cause I really do kill this shit 
 Stacks on deck, and baby you know the song, 
 So sing along, c'mon... 
 (Verse 1: Trey Songz) 
 Shawty what it is though, you know who I is though 
 When we ready you can come, and you can let ya friend go 
 You can let your friend come too 
 'Cause, I picture your friend on you (Yup!) 
 Smokin' killa Indo, got it from my kinfolk 
 Haters what you made for, 'cause you know you dead broke 
 What they let you in for, shawty you a ten though 
 Won't you hop yo ass up in them [? ] 
 'Cause, once you let me touch it, ain't no need for discussion 
 I'm a have yo body buzzin', like an automatic weapon 
 I know it's a recession, but I'm making an exception, for yo bad ass 
 If you want that damn bag, then gon' and grab it 
 You can have it, just one swipe of this here plastic 
 Girl, I bet you won't be stresstin', if you let them panties lessin' 
 I mean listen I'm the truth, and just want you fruits and juices 
 One more look at your pass, throw the dueces (Yuupp!) 
 (Chorus: Trey Songz) 
 Stacks on deck, that's on my life 
 You never wear the same thing twice, 
 If you like with ya boy toniigghhttt 
 You can have whatever you liiikkkeeee 
 Yeah!, 
 And you gon' have the best sex of yo life, 
 Twice, three time, four time, 
 We gon' get it on toniiigghhhhtt 
 You can have whatever you liiikkkkeeee 
 Yeah! 
 (Verse 2: Trey Songz) 
 We up on that E&G, some bonified drinkers 
 She gave me that brain, she a hella fine thinker 
 Thought process is sex'em from desk to the sink'er 
 Body so wet, I got'er so wet 
 I be her supplier, she give me the fire 
 She never get tired, call'er in her dryser[? ] 
 Funny, funny ride, I got my money right 
 You can tell what I'm doing, by the tires on my ride 
 Stretch out so wiidddee, them 26's 
 Y'all dudes listen, I'm screw pimpin' 
 Y'all sto-pigeons, somethin' like when I'm on stool shittin' 
 Let me tell you what, y'all dudes listen 
 A bit of my style, a bit of my flow, a bit of my smile, a bit of my clothes 
 Maybe just a bit of my dough 
 Any time you want to, pick up the telephone to, 
 Call me to your house, show you what I'm 'bout 
 I'll be so ablige, now hop up in my ride 
 With them gold packs, know that's extra L size 
 (Chorus: Trey Songz) 
 Stacks on deck, that's on my life 
 You never wear the same thing twice, 
 If you like with ya boy toniigghhttt 
 You can have whatever you liiikkkeeee 
 Yeah!, 
 And you gon' have the best sex of yo life, 
 Twice, three time, four time, 
 We gon' get it on toniiigghhhhtt 
 You can have whatever you liiikkkkeeee 
 Yeah! 
 (Verse 3: Trey Songz) 
 Tell me what you like, I got it 
 Tell me what you need, I got it 
 Tell me what you want, I got it 
 Tell me what it be, I got it 
 Supersiiizzeee, like some friieeesss 
 Like McDonald, my big Ronald will make you roll yo eyes back 
 Tell me can you buy that, tell me can you ride that 
 Once I get inside, I'm a glide like a slide at Water Woorrrllldd 
 You tha giirrll, and I'm tha maaannnn 
 So understand... 
 (Chorus/Outro: Trey Songz) 
 Stacks on deck, that's on my life 
 You never wear the same thing twice, 
 If you like with ya boy toniigghhttt 
 You can have whatever you liiikkkeeee 
 Yeah!, 
 And you gon' have the best sex of yo life, 
 Twice, three time, four time, 
 We gon' get it on toniiigghhhhtt 
 You can have whatever you liiikkkkeeee 
 Yeah!
