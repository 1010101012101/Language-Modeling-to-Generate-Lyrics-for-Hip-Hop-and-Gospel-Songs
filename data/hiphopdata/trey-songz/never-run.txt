Lately a niggas been tryna to make sure that all these hoes stay fucked 
 That a nigga doe stay caked up 
 That my niggas stay the same never change and we don't break up 
 That's forever nigga never let no dough change up 
 I just wanna put my city on the map and thangs 
 Niggas countin' my money sayin' I'm actin' strange 
 But I'm stayin in the hood like the cracks in the sidewalk 
 Music is my hustle keep my crack by the sidewalk 
 And if there ever was a problem boy 
 Slippin ima catch you with revolvin toys 
 I said if ever there's a problem boy 
 U slippin ima catch you with revolvin toys 
 Close attention to the words I'm spittin' 
 Listen nigga in the game you'll get it 
 I'm pimpin' my life 
 Nigga this is my life 
 I deserve all the shit that I got 
 Niggas don't know all the shyt that I've done 
 Niggas can talk all the shit that you want 
 But never ever never ever never will I run 
 I'll never run 
 Never run 
 Never run 
 Never run 
 Never run 
 Niggas keep hatin' but no matter the situation niggas know I got my gun 
 So I never run 
 No I never run 
 No I never runnnnnnn
