 SONGZ (remix) 
 [Lil Wayne:] And Young Weezy Baby 
 (Verse 1: Lil Wayne) 
 Ok, shawty lemme holla atchya 
 You need a man who won't holla atchya 
 Won't throw a dolla atchya 
 And listen when you speak 
 And when we make love you can holla at me 
 But when you wake up shawty say she gotta leave 
 Man I wish I was dumb so I can set her free 
 Cause that's freedom do you understand me 
 Baby I know I'm a blood but let ya other man be 
 (Verse 2: Trey Songz) 
 I see you watchya gon do 
 You need to lose that nigga, ooh that nigga 
 Can't do what I do, he can't make your body speak 
 Make it go ooh, ooh ooh ooh 
 You can be dealin' with a reala trilla dude 
 Whatchya gon do shawty lemme know 
 It's gettin' to the point where I can't take no more (I can't take no more) 
 Guess what I'm tryna say is 
 I can't wait no more 
 (Chorus: Trey Songz) 
 Girl I can't help but wait 
 Till you get that with him it don't change 
 Girl I can't wait 
 Till you see that with me it ain't the same 
 Girl I can't wait 
 Till you see you for what you really are 
 Baby girl you are a star 
 And I can't help but wait 
 (Verse 3: Trey Songz) 
 Listen, It ain't fresh to just let him call the shots 
 You're a queen you should be gettin' all that someone's got 
 You should be rockin' the latest in purses, bracelets, and watches 
 You're worth much more then an occasional I love you 
 I'm thinking of you 
 And baby girl it's getting to the point where I can't take no more (I can't take no more) 
 Guess what I'm tryna say is 
 I can't wait no more 
 (Chorus: Trey Songz) 
 (Verse 4: Lil Wayne) 
 I got patience 
 Doctor Carter baby yeah I got patience 
 Pullin' up on you in a humee 
 And somethin' as wide as a Sony flat screen 
 Watchin' Tony Montana like I never seen 
 But I can hear your heart screamin' lemme redeem it 
 'Cause he don't know what he doin' he just intervening 
 He's an inconvenient, inconvenience 
 It's simple science 
 I mix science better yet math 
 Me plus you baby girl let's add 
 And we never divide we just subtract 
 His punk ass my class I'll pass 
 'Cause I pass 
 Leave the pads and I'll pass 
 I ain't worried about that 
 I never look back 
 Your boyfriend wack 
 Wonder why I call him that? 
 Because a real man never talk with his hands 
 Boy you a girl, girl you grand 
 Like ten hundred dolla bills you grand 
 And girl I'm a g tell ya girls about me 
 And I'm a only beat dat spot 
 If you sweet I'm a hit ya sweet spot 
 And he not 
 I can make it sound like a little teapot 
 And if dat nigga hurt you I'mma kiss you till it stop 
 I'm on the clock 
 (Chorus: Trey Songz) 
 [Lil Wayne:] yeah yeah Remix baby remix baby remix remix baby
