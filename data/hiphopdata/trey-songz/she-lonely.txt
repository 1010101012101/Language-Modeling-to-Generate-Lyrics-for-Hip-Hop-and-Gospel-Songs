Yo 
 I'm at that time 
 In my life, heh 
 I kinda 
 Kinda need somebody 
 You know 
 For the first time 
 For the first time 
 In my life 
 I'm lonely 
 Comes a time 
 In a man's life 
 When you're looking 
 For a change 
 It ain't feeling right 
 When you know 
 You need a lady 
 Someone that you 
 Can call your baby 
 Oh, ain't it funny 
 When you think 
 You got it all 
 Got plenty of honeys 
 Which one 
 Am I gonna call 
 Ain't none 
 Of these girls 
 Right for me 
 (No) 
 All they want 
 Is one night 
 Have you ever been lonely 
 You don't even wanna sex 
 You want a homie 
 So many different girls 
 Tell me 
 That they own me 
 But they tripping 
 Y'all 
 They so phony 
 Have you ever been lonely 
 You don't even wanna sex 
 You want a homie 
 (I want a homie, y'all) 
 So many different girls 
 Tell me 
 That they own me 
 But they tripping 
 Y'all 
 I'm so lonely 
 I ain't gon' lie 
 Always been 
 A player, mayne 
 (Player, mayne) 
 I'm giving up 
 That fast life 
 I'm tryna 
 Switch lanes 
 I want a homie 
 Lover, friend 
 Or a chick, mayne 
 To hold it down 
 Or keep it real 
 (That is it, mayne) 
 And I done had 
 Lotta time to myself 
 Oh, no 
 I feel that it's 
 About time for me 
 To be somebody real 
 People 
 They hatin' love 
 That ain't right 
 (That ain't right) 
 You know it 
 Makes me so unhappy 
 Try to keep it 
 Away from me 
 (Oh, no) 
 Misery loves company 
 Girl 
 Try to play games 
 With my mind 
 (With my mind) 
 Need someone 
 In these arms of mine 
 Ain't no limit 
 To how far I'll go 
 (Oh, no) 
 But until then 
 I guess 
 I'll be alone 
 (Alone) 
 I want a homie 
 Y'all 
 I want a homie 
 Y'all 
 I need a homie 
 Y'all 
 Find me a homie 
 Y'all
