I can't help but wait. oh i 
 I can't help but wait 
 (Check it out) 
 (Verse 1: trey songz) 
 I see u, u wit him, he ain't right but you don't trip 
 U stand by, while he lies, then turn right round and forgive 
 I can't take, to see your face wit those tears runin down yo cheeks 
 But what can I do, I gotta stay true, 'cause deep down I'm still a g 
 And I don't wanna come between you and your man, 
 Even tho I know I'll treat you betta than he can 
 Girl I can't help but wait 
 (Chorus:trey songz) 
 Till you get back wit him, it don't change 
 (Can't help but wait) 
 Till you see that wit me, it ain't the same 
 (Can't help but wait) 
 Till u, see u, for what you really are, 
 (Baby girl you are a star) 
 And I can't help but wait 
 (Verse 2: trey songz) 
 It ain't fresh, to jus let him call the shots 
 You're a queen, u should be, gettin' all that someone's got 
 You should be rockin' the latest, and purses, bracelets and watches 
 Your worth much more than an occasional "i love u", "I'm thinkin' of u" 
 And I don't wanna come between you and your man, no 
 Even tho I know I'll treat you betta than he can 
 Girl I can't help but wait 
 (Chorus: trey songz) 
 Till you get back wit him, it don't change 
 (Can't help but wait) 
 Till you see that wit me, it ain't the same 
 (Can't help but wait) 
 Till u, see u, for what you really are, 
 (Baby girl you are a star) 
 And I can't help but wait 
 Get it together, u can do better 
 Seein is believing, and I see what you need so 
 I'm gon play my position, let you catch what you been missin' 
 I'm callin out! 
 Girl 'cause I can't help but wait 
 (Chorus x2: trey songz) 
 Till you get back wit him, it don't change 
 (Can't help but wait) 
 Till you see that wit me, it ain't the same 
 (Can't help but wait) 
 Till u, see u, for what you really are, 
 (Baby girl you are a star) 
 And I can't help but wait 
 (Trey:) 
 Oh oh

 No no no no no

 Oh oh 
 Can't help but wait 
 No no no.
