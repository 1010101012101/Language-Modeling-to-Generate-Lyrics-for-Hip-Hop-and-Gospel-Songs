*Clears Throat* 
 Listen 
 Baby understand me now 
 (You get me now, but you know...) 
 If sometimes you see that I'm mad 
 (Sometimes I flip out) 
 Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel? 
 When everything goes wrong, you see some bad 
 (But, you don't know my story) 
 But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
 (&& I don't know yours. So just?) 
 Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood 
 Skinny dude, with braids straight back 
 Straight out of Virginia in a black du rag 
 Accord got to whippin up that Highway 
 Fuck college, I'm tryna do it my way 
 Long nights, long days, hard work, no pay 
 Studyin my crafts 
 Stepdad actin' gay (Bitch) 
 Punk nigga, dumb nigga, bet he mad now (Bitch) 
 See me on TV, when he sit his ass down 
 (Bitch) 
 Folks took interest, offered me some paper 
 Now, you know these labels tryna rape ya 
 Lord's on my side so the paperwork's ride 
 19 years-old && a nigga got signed (Aye Ma, they wanna sign me) 
 50k on the advance, now I feel like I'm the man 
 I'll never drive this mothafuckin Honda shit again (Fuck that Honda) 
 New people at the label getting hired, bosses getting fired, two more years till anybody kne0w who I was 
 I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
 (Why ain't ya shit dropped yet? 
 I mean, I know you gotta deal, what's up?) 
 Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood 
 (You gotta know my struggle. 
 It don't all fit in the song either shawty) 
 (Man, nigga, you ain't neva comin' out *Chuckles*) 
 I gotta make it, I never be complicit 
 Even though these label niggas got me on some wait shit 
 Shout my nigga Radio, we gon? mixtape it 
 Did 'bout a 100 songs in this nigga, Troy basement 
 Really tho, on to the video 
 Shot it in my hood, kept it hood, niggas know 
 I'm goin' hella far, I wanna take my niggas tho 
 And Butta says its koo, but it's 30 niggas, yo 
 OK, we too deep 
 Grab 2 Seat && Finch && Baby 
 Redd said [?] 
 Koo, we gon? do what we do 
 I got my own tour, HBCU 
 Well, who gon? open up? 
 Some CB dude 
 I think the nigga koo 
 He from Virginia too 
 We formed a lil friendship, something like some kin shit 
 This my lil dude 
 We watched each otha show && glow up 
 Label bullshittin, so, I watched my nigga blow up 
 Oh, fuck! 
 You know what? My times comin' tho, I ain't neva gon give up, through adversity baby, I shine like a mothafuckin star. Believe that 
 I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
 O lord please don't let me be misunderstood 
 I'ma skip some && come back lata 
 Label ain't shit, so 2 years lata 
 New album, whole long process 
 They wanna gimme they songs, so fuck my shit 
 But, hol? up, ain't this my shit? 
 Barkin at the meetings 
 Cussin at these people 
 Long story, short, I ain't fuckin' with these people 
 Gotta find compromise, if you wanna sequel 
 Money getting low, gotta take care of my people 
 Excuse me, if I believe in creativity 
 That bullshit music, I can not do it It's useless, I'm tryna broaden my horizon 
 I play 'em ?Wonder Woman? at the office 
 I'm surprised 
 We discuss it, they love it, they think the world of it 
 Wanna push it, let's do it, I'm tryna get to it 
 Record movin slow, but I tried to put 'em on 
 I needa do some shows, they needa see me perform 
 After all that, on the song they pick, they gon' fall back, like Songz ain't shit 
 No money for the tour, opening act for Ne-Yo 
 Couple years before, he opened up for me tho 
 It's all G tho, I spend my own C Notes 
 Musically, could be dead, but I'm, livin' 'cause I'm me tho 
 Of course the Big GO 
 D, won't be no 
 Me without ?em, never poutin, little faith could move a mountain 
 So, watchu do about it?

 ?Can't Help But Wait? 
 Finally, Trey done got his big break 
 Wait, it's not over 
 Since then, I paid for 2 more tours, a video, I'm so official, yo 
 I get it on my own, ain't nobody gotta let me 
 That's why I say I'm READY 
 I'm just a soul whose intentions are good 
 (I'm just a soul) 
 O lord please don't let me be misunderstood 
 (Ya know?don't let me be misunderstood) 
 I done jumped off stages && fucked niggas up 
 I done got into altercations with police 
 That don't make me no different from the next man 
 Just 'cause a nigga on TV don't mean he don't go through shit G 
 I'm tryna do me 
 And If you like, screw me 
 But, you ain't neva knew me 
 You don't mean shit to me?Truly 
 And It's more to it, but I can't even get all into it 
 It's one song, 5 minutes && some change long 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Songz
