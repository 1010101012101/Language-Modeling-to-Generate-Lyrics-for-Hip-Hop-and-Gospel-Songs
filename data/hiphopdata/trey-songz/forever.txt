Oh 
 Oah oah 
 She said she love me, she don't wanna let me go 
 But she's been crying I can hear it in her tone 
 It's her emotions and they about to overflow 
 I've been doing her wrong for to long 
 Plus she's got everything that any man could want 
 I swear on everything I love her to the bone 
 But I'm still trippin', I'm flippin outta control 
 Gotta get it together or she's gone 
 Had a dream it was you, it was me and two kids had a dog & a house with 
 But then I woke up it was me 2 chicks, I'm a dog, so bent, 
 Ain't no telling what I did 
 Girl I can see myself with you forever, 
 Loving forever, kissing forever 
 In the future girl I see us together, 
 Loving forever and ever and ever 
 But forevers not hear 
 Baby forevers not near 
 Forevers not hear but I can see us together, forever and ever 
 I can't explain the way this woman makes me feel I swear that it's so real for her I would kill an all this pain I caused this woman I could feel I know that may sound I'll but at least it's for real, I'm addictied to the rush 'cause I said if I was in love I would give it up, girl I wanna give it up when I close my eyes at night all I see is us. 
 Had a dream it was you, it was me and two kids had a dog & a house with

 Loving forever, kissing forever 
 In the future girl I see us together, 
 Loving forever and ever and ever 
 But forevers not hear 
 Baby forevers not near 
 Forevers not hear but I can see us together, forever and ever 
 Baby when forever comes us two will be us one trust no one will ever come and break us apart, tear us apart my heart is your heart and nobody else matters guess you could say I'm not ready right now and girl I know the tables turned around I been acting a fool see I'm telling the truth girl I don't wanna lose ya because...
