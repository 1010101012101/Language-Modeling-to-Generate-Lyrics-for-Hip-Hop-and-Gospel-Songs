I keep my mind on my money so, 
 I'm always grindin'. & you should never , ever have to be reminded.  Everything I do baby, I do it for you baby. 
 Just know I'm telling you the truth baby. 
 I'ma hold you down till' the day I die. I'ma hold you down till' the day I die. 
 I'ma hold you down, I'ma hold you down, I'ma hold you down till' the day 
 I die (x3) 
 [VERSE 1] 
 I'm on my way to the top girl; I'm flyer than a missile be. Mix screams, big things they know what the issue be. I know when I'm gone, in the zone, you be missin' me. Don't ever forget the way I feel when you're kissin' me. When I hit the stage, world wide, girl I hope you ain't forgettin' me. I'm out here makin history. When I hit the club VIP, I like when they be diggin' me. I give a lot of liquor free.
