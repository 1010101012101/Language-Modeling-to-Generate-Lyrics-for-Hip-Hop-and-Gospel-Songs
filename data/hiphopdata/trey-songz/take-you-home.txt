I'm really into you, see we been dancin since about 2:36 
 I'm bout to make my move, n make you understand I got some other plans 
 Thinkin' itd be better if we got together, after this dance 
 You got some reservations see your hesitation, but you're in good hands 
 Shawty you make my night I really like how you dancin fo me, we need to leave 
 Girl my cars outside, got a surprise that I want you to see girl I believe 
 That you're ready tonight I think you want me to take you home 
 I can make you feel nice, if you let me take you home 
 Top down let's chill, we doin' 95 flyin down 95 
 Come on and pop this pill, I call it superlove you with a superthug 
 So let yo hair down I need a girl that I know you can be 
 When we hit this jaccuzi you won't need yo panties, girl you'll jus need me 
 Shawty you make my night I really like how you dancin fo me, we need to leave 
 Girl my cars outside, got a surprise that I want you to see girl I believe 
 That you're ready tonight I think you want me to take you home 
 I can make you feel nice, if you let me take you home 
 I feel a vibe when I look in yo eyes they're tellin' me you feel it too 
 Step in my room lay in the bed relax yo mind and yo body too 
 If you want I promise I'm a take it real slow 
 N once I get you hot I bet you'll never get cold 
 Tel me what you want, you know what I need

 Shawty you make my night I really like how you dancin fo me, we need to leave 
 Girl my cars outside, got a surprise that I want you to see girl I believe 
 That you're ready tonight I think you want me to take you home 
 I can make you feel nice, if you let me take you home
