Let Me hodl that beat... [x3] 
 That beat 
 Funny funny funny boy I can't stop laughing 
 Money money money can't stop getting cash 
 You looking for the prince 
 Well you found him 
 Broke niggas can't even be around him 
 And I'm only being honest 
 Fuck being modest 
 Ghetto girls change hair colors like Rodman 
 All on my dick like condom 
 And she take that dick 
 Like a robber 
 Call it burglary 
 Certainly 
 I cut her up 
 Like surgery 
 And now her baby daddy wants to murder me 
 He call my phone like 
 Is you banging my girl? 
 My girl 
 All I reply 
 Playa bet to check her 
 Don't want to disrespect ya 
 I never even met cha 
 She never even mention your name 
 I don't know why you mad at me 
 You should ask your girl 
 She gave the ass to me 
 Stop harassing me 
 Why you so upset with me? 
 I don't even know you 
 It's clear that she had sex with me 
 Stop calling my phone you, 
 Know she's guilty no questionin'(?) 
 He talking bout what you gon do 
 Gon do 
 Funny funny funny boy I can't stop laughing 
 Money money money can't stop getting cash 
 You a loser tho 
 You a loser tho 
 You a loser 
 Fellas if your girl 
 Let a man get at her 
 And you hit up the man 
 Then your ass playing backwards 
 Happens to the best 
 You are not alone 
 Her booty and her breast 
 Is nothing you can own 
 Funny funny funny boy I can't stop laughing 
 Money money money can't stop getting cash 
 Throw it in the bag 
 Got paper got plastic 
 Think I got it mastered 
 Haters are fanatics 
 I need em' around 
 Any time I want my ass kissed 
 I'm only drinking brown 
 And I'm only smoking sunkist 
 Orange haired weed 
 Got me acting like a weirdo 
 Shine like me 
 Your the diamonds in my earlobe 
 Heard from a bird 
 That trigga was an asshole 
 Fuck what you heard 
 Like penis in your earhole 
 September 1st

 Why niggas be mad 
 Why another muthfucka wanna hit they girl... [x3] 
 I just wanna
