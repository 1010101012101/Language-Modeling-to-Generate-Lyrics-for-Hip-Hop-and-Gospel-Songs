P.I. Yeah, aye, wussup 'cause, it's going down 
 East side yeah, your boy sean p, nelly, pimp see, aye 
 My paint too wet bitch, never pay my set bitch 
 Blue and red make green, just cash the check bitch 
 Went to the car lot, bought me a Vanquish 
 Never trick my money in the club with a skank bitch 
 Big shrimp on my plate, look like dolphins [dolphins] 
 Pushin cookies in the soft ones 
 I can do better, by myself, not bad 
 Girl ate the whole thing if she call me Chad 
 The reppas ain't settin up there, they mad 
 Rappin' like us gotta hit, but you a fag 
 I'm a young country nigga, uncut like snow 
 Make them young bloodz get down on the flo' 
 Make them young niggas put candy on the let[?] 
 You got clouds in them diamonds, take that monkey shit back 
 'Cause, smokin' high, throwin' up, keep that lean off in my cut 
 Smokin' high, throwin' up, keep that heat off in our truck 
 When I hit the parkin lot and the 5th wheel drop 
 You know damn well, you don't wanna see me, all eyes on me 
 When I'm fresh from the jeweler and it's sunny outside 
 You know damn well, you don't wanna see me, all eyes on me 
 When I'm freezed up, j'd[?] up, e'z in my k'z[???] 
 You know damn well, you don't wanna see me all eyes on me 
 From all the niggas that's trill to them niggas unreal 
 You know damn well you don't wanna see me, uh-uh 
 So quit it man, lil boy, cut it out, look here 
 Quit it man, lil boy, cut it out, look here 
 Quit it man, lil boy cut it out, go head 
 No watch my fingers, lil boy, cut it out, hold up! 
 I ain't choose yo chick, yo chick chose me 
 I ain't gotta pick one, imma take alla these 
 For every hundred you got, imma peel off three 
 Hey, don't worry 'bout it lil boy, the bill on me 
 Eight years now, you can call me a vet 
 That money you got, call that a forth of my neck 
 We don't call paint shiny, we call paint wet 
 A duro strawberry colored coup, call that a mint 
 Got a few rides already, got a few more to cop 
 Got a blue one that's hard, got a black one that drop 
 Got a buick that's green, the same color my snot 
 Lil daddy, you ain't the shit, you might as well get off the pot 
 That's some new st. louis shit, yeah that's funny 
 But imma stick with the old, the new don't make enough money 
 Do when I'm old, wipe me down 
 When they dirty, wipe them down 
 You think I showed my ass before 
 Sit front row and watch me now! 
 'Cause my grandmama hate it but my lil mama love [x2] 
 28 inches sittin' tall, it's ridiculous 
 With a slow yellow bitch 
 'Cause that's the type I kick it with 
 Rydin with a stupid pack and a couple stupid cats 
 They call us the goon squad 
 So you know we stupid strapped 
 Shuttin down the parkin lot 
 We're doin' the moonwalk 
 I ain't stuntin' now hoe 'cause I'm tryin' to blood talk 
 I be where they work at, where niggas get merked at 
 Her wish bread[?] where they mount it up and drop the purp at 
 Can't you tell I'm hood rich 
 You ain't from my hood bitch 
 Don't you see the leather seats 
 The way we grip the wood pimp 
 Goin' hard on it, while I signed on it 
 Suppose to buy the hood, this is all grind money 
 Poppin' tangs on it, throwin' grands on it 
 Nelly grabbed the wheel and made the chevy dance on 
 I'm a block star, ain't a phony nigga [naw, never!] 
 A phone call a had 'em youngstas on on ya nigga 
 So don't start no shit, won't be no shit[x2]
