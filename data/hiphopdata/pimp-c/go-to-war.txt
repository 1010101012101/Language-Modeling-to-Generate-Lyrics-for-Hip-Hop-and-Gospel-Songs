"Go To War" 
 (Chorus: Pimp C) 
 Poppin' pills workin' wood wheel 
 Fuck where ya from and fuck how ya feel 
 If you wanna go to war I'll take ya to war 
 I gotta ak47 and a chick in the car 
 (Verse 1: Lil Scrappy) 
 Yeah, I was born military 
 Thuggin' nigga ever since 
 Mama taught a young nigga to gon' and get that presidence 
 Ballin on ya residence but I'm still thuggin' tho 
 Got dem crack fans standin around like a rock show 
 Just bought a dime now they screaming out fa 5-0 
 Dime piece collection in the Tec I got the air hole 
 What you looking at me for 
 'Cause I'm on that drank hoe 
 And I'm gone off some that mission impossible 
 I'm flexible, I still can move through traffic 
 If I get into it with one of ya bastards I'm'a let you have it 
 Go reach fo' one of my gadgets take the pen out of the cannon 
 You'll be dead in a casket mama thinkin' was that for strappin 
 Poppin' pills workin' wood wheel 
 Fuck where ya from and fuck how ya feel 
 If you wanna go to war I'll take ya to war 
 I gotta ak47 and a chick in the car 
 (Verse 2: Diamond) 
 Look, any motherfucka step up get wet up guaranteed to feel the heat 
 Well I'm packin lotta stackin attacking smackin crack in da cap in yo team in deep 
 Always bustin' up clips you bleed keep a nigga down on his knees 
 When you mess wit little Diamond so shinin' and blindin' grindin' fryin' hoes cowardly 
 All you bitches bout dancing' me, ain't none of y'all my homie 
 We bringin' the Tony Montana's and hammers and banners that's hard to beat 
 I got that shit you need just like the air you breathe 
 My lyrical spirits are critical miracle burn like gasoline 
 I'm slick as vaseline put a look in the must homie 
 I'm the realist appealist that's trillest that's illest that's on the scene 
 Yeah hoe I'm running thangs, 'cause now I'm in the game 
 Ball that hoop and switch and shooting like le'bron james 
 Poppin' pills workin' wood wheel 
 Fuck where ya from and fuck how ya feel 
 If you wanna go to war I'll take ya to war 
 I gotta ak47 and a chick in the car 
 (Verse 3: Pimp C) 
 Ughh, I pimp tight like MJG 
 Body body like Master P 
 Showing out in the parking lot 
 BKA Young Pimp see, AKA Sweet Jones 
 Change my name to Tony Snow Love a crow 
 Came off whippin' snow in a Pyrex bowl 
 My car dangerous hit it with the sprite 
 Hittin' 10 in a Benz truck full of work, nothing' but white 
 Gettin' hot on the street lights Rolls Royce not the motor bikes 
 Not a lover just a Mac dump the sack I drip the lac' I 
 If you know like I know bitch you wouldn't be sayin' that 
 Monkey talk get people killed, I spend ya cool-aid pack 
 If you if you not willing to see me best not say my name 
 We ain't got no time to be guessing and playing no pussy games 
 Poppin' pills workin' wood wheel 
 Fuck where ya from and fuck how ya feel 
 If you wanna go to war I'll take ya to war 
 I gotta ak47 and a chick in the car
