Leanin', leanin', sittin' sideways 
 Leanin', leanin', sittin' sideways 
 Leanin', leanin', leanin', sittin' sideways 
 Leanin', sittin' sideways, leanin', leanin', sittin' sideways 
 I'mma young ghetto boy dat's why I act dis way, rollin' in the candy car leanin' sittin' sideways 
 Big boss of that damn nawf, grab the mic straight run his mouth 
 Candy blue what you see me floss, when I pull the lac up out the house 
 Big boss of that damn nawf, grab the mic straight run his mouth 
 Candy blue what you see me floss, when I pull the lac up out the house 
 Lookin' good while I hold the wood, on the slab shit's understood 
 Hit the stash chunk up the hood, boys gotta see me stunt for good 
 New car new ice, it ain't shit I can pay that price, 
 Niggas ain't living like the boss live, that's what that is and I say that twice 
 I tip the 4's and flip the roads, before that album got shipped to stores 
 Boys betta keep they lips closed, before they punk-ass get exposed 
 I done showed the world how the boss hold, slab or foreign I floss those 
 Drank and dro got me floss mode, doin' 100 on the toll road 
 Pimp and bun runnin' right behind, pieced up with the grill shine 
 10 years still putting it down, representin' for that h-town 
 Michael watts got the beats slow, slim thug keep the streets throwed 
 Brains straight bout to be blowed, cause rico got them sweets rolled 
 Now ask them cause the streets know, the big boss man got it locked 
 H-town man I'mma shout that out, till I'm up in heaven wit pimp and pac. 
 Sweet jones bitch! unnh unnh unnh 
 Tony snow the mack not the myth, the pimp 
 I got the gift to break a bitch, twenty thousand behind my lips 
 A hundred thousand on my neck, every time that I step out 
 Bought the red thang from chamillion, candy paint swangin' in the drop 
 I keep the hoes pussy drip drop wet, lamborghini fuck the vet 
 Top gone let's get it on, I'm the real bitch he's a clone 
 Smelling like bar 9 cologne, gotta billion dollars out my microphone 
 Slab crusha, dome busta, 
 Promethazine mixed with the tussa 
 We call it banana split, choose a pimp hoe I'm legit 
 Wrecked the grey bitch, bought the red 
 I got a phantom too that's what the fuck I said 
 And I ain't dropped an album yet 
 Spend my dirty money don't touch the check 
 If the rap game die I buy some work 
 And keep a young yella bitch that will pull up my skirt 
 And when the bitch get enough her pussy squirt 
 Tricks love to see (how it works?) 
 I love the money she love the fame 
 I gotta leveled head she gotta piece of the brain 
 I gotta 3-way lover on my singular 
 She gotta 4 inch with jack mick hair 
 Between her legs I'm tellin' you 
 And she pay her daddy and that's what it do 
 It's bun be the man and not the myth, ridin' on them 4's trunk got the fifth 
 I push one button on my remote, start up my slab and my trunk will lift 
 I got the gift I got straight from god, keep it real never fraud 
 From p-a-t the land of the trill, so when come out I'mma come out hard 
 You know the name and the resume, my g-code files is documented 
 Certified rap-a-lot for life, down with the mob represented 
 Don't play them games because I got the change, to put it in ya mind and on ya brain 
 You'll leak coming out the candy, die where you standing simple and plain 
 I'mma gangsta baby not a baby gangsta, I'm overgrown it's understood 
 Slim thug the boss, see the pimp, and I'm bun the og to run the hood 
 We got the good, and the flower, hard or soft get it rock or powder 
 But know ya shit when you hit ya lick, it don't come with a textbook ?? 
 And the power and the bread, so fuck a law dog, and fuck a fed 
 I'm from the south and we got the crown, and you can't get it back until I'm dead 
 Heard what I said, and press rewind, play it back so you can get the meaning 
 Coming down in that candy slab, grippin' on the grain and you know I'm leanin' 
 Leanin', leanin', sittin' sideways 
 Leanin', leanin', sittin' sideways 
 Leanin', leanin', leanin', sittin' sideways 
 Leanin', sittin' sideways, leanin', leanin', sittin' sideways
