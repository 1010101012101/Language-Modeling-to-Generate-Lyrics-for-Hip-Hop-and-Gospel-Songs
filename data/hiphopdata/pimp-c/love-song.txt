(Missez) 
 Boy you make me wanna sing you a love song 
 (Pimp C) 
 Unh, I'm still smokin' out, pourin' up, makin' young girls bust dey nuts 
 Old school, straight pro, make 'em get down on da floor 
 I'm a keep it gangsta wit ya, I'ma beat it up 
 Pay yo daddy well, I'ma let 'em just eat it up 
 When you saw me in da club, I was off in pimp mode 
 Pimp mind, pimp juice, gator shoes, mack clothes 
 I caught yo eye, you caught my eye 
 It's all da shame 
 Let's put this thing together 
 Momma let's do da damn thing 
 (Missez) 
 Stepped into the club, the bass beatin' so loud 
 Boy I see you peepin' me through the smoke cloud 
 Gotta play it off I gotta keep my cool I 
 Wanna know your name becuz I am feeling you so 
 I walk up to you slow say, "Baby, would you like to get to know me?" 
 Then you put yo hands up on my body 
 Baby don't let go 
 Anything you want boy you can have I'm yours 
 Ooh ah, come on baby give it to me 
 Just like that boy you know exactly what I need from you 
 Yeah you really turn me on boy you make me wanna sing you a love song 
 (Repeat) 
 (Missez) 
 Temperatures rising, you got me hoping that your love is hypnotizing 
 To the next level boy with you is where I wanna go 
 But if I'm moving too fast, baby just let me know (let me know) 
 Just let me know 
 Boy it's somethin' 'bout the way you move that makes me wonder 
 How you work it 'cause my sheets I want you under 
 Don't stop 'cause I like what you're doin' babe 
 Keep it movin' right there 
 You make me wanna say 
 (Pimp C) 
 I like it when you open up and let me in 
 Gettin' real freaky off in the Benz 
 Cattacorner, legs up, that's da way we like to fuck 
 Got a million ways when I'm on da maze 
 Straight up, smokin' purple haze 
 Get down on it, let me see it 
 I'm ya daddy gurl let me beat it 
 You my private dancer, gurl 
 And I'm a put this thing up in your world 
 Get your nuts just like a squirell 
 No powder, no fur 
 Just a bunch of stanky danky 
 Just a little bit of hanky panky 
 Pimp C, da dick ain't free 
 You're ridin' wit da best, when you're fuckin' wit me
