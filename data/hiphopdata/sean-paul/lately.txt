 Baby girl, we should be making love 
 Of lately baby you and me been moving crazy 
 But you're my world, my girl your love has saved me 
 No other love, no other girl, no other lady 
 Could take the place of you my boo, dawg, don't forsake me 
 Baby girl, don't you know that I'm the one that

 Girl when I think about it the years that we devoted 
 Have been the best of my life I don't know what I'd do without it 
 Sometimes the liquor may cloud it but girl no bother doubt it 
 And if there's still a doubt up inna your brain then just de load it 
 I tell you baby girl upon the search, true love we found it 
 And up the river of life together girl we gonna fload it
