Im so buff, I'm hot n I'm tuff 
 I drive a saxo, its realli fast, I present d show like da cast 
 I'm heavi 'n' kool drivin' down d road in ma sr mode got 
 My saxo 1.3 u ain't gona catch me I'm d only rap bitch in da town, 
 I'm d ganger of d sound, I smile 
 Den I frown, I dnt wear a crown, 
 I am a king, ping ping, 
 I'm a king, ping ping rokin d mike, like a spike, d needle is broke 
 Its gun down, down down I'm a strong gurl, I dnt need love, 
 I don't need kiss, hug 
 I need a car, a fast 1, 
 If ur in2 lovin' I'm in2 huggin so rev up ya engine 'n' bring it on!
