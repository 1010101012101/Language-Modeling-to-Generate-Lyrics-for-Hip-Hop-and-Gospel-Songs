I've done some stupid shit 
 I've even lied to you. You know that for a fact 
 Plus all I've put you through (All I've put you through) 
 It still amazes me (Me). How you've forgiven me (Yeah) 
 If I could take it back. I wouldn't have done those silly things 
 (How do you do it) A much more bigger man than me 
 (How can I repay you) 'Cause you stuck in there with me 
 (I won't forgetcha) How it's so clear. Now I see 
 Still you're the only one that I can count on 
 Ya never gave up on me 
 Things come and go. Seasons change. People grow 
 The world turns. But our love remains the same 
 Things come and go. Winter. Summer. Spring and Fall 
 Through it all. Our love remains the same 
 I don't know how it all happened but (But) you're everything and more (Everything and more) 
 Even thought I might lose you because I didn't work hard enough 
 Figured since you lost my trust (Ooh) that we would just fall apart (Yeah) 
 Now I realize I need to wake up 
 So I'm giving you all my heart 
 (I remember) Oh watchin' the clouds go by 
 (You were always there) Always right there by my side 
 (Can't forget you) I can't forget you as I reminisce on this tree 
 You were the only one. That was in my life 
 Who showed me consistency 
 (Repeat Hook) 
 (Sean Paul (2x)) 
 Things change from year to year, girl 
 But my love for you is always here, girl 
 Never 'fraid. Never have no fear 
 Baby call me and I will appear. Well 
 (Breakdown) 
 Can I take you away from this place 
 Whatever you wanna do. Oh my baby it's cool 
 Take my hand let's make plans 
 Just as long (As you are here and boy I'm with you) 
 (Repeat Hook (2x)) 
 (Sean Paul (2x) over hook) 
 Things change from year to year, girl. 
 But my love for you is always here, girl. 
 Never 'fraid. Never have no fear, baby. 
 Call me and I will appear. Well
