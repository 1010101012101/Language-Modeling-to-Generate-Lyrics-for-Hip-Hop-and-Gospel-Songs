(Intro: Sean Paul) 
 From the rest fire 
 She press pier (Yes-Nay ah!) 
 She call me the squire 
 Lock it off well tight 
 And give her it higher 
 Can't deny her... 
 Sean-Da-Paul alongside Corleon... 
 Fire! 
 (Chorus x2: Corleon) 
 Sweat-sweat-sweat-sweat-sweat 
 Get you really wet 
 Girl I've got just what you want 
 To leave your body soaking wet. 
 (Verse 1: Sean Paul) 
 Real it a fall 
 And the gal this bawl 
 And the gal this a bit pon my tress (my tress) 
 She want it all 
 She nuh want me to stall 
 And she want me to give her it endless (endless) 
 The power and straight and... 
 Make she repaint and... 
 Give her it love up in a excess 
 Same time she a wiggle and wine and bawl out my name 
 And say me a the greatest, cause... 
 When me ready to pick up the base 
 And put it proper pon her 
 Gal a bawl... {Written By N.A.R.E.K.} 
 Just like say a some day 
 ?Help God? she a call 
 Making her, sweetie 
 Believe that stress is what I'm doing, that's all 
 Anything me tell her she do it well fast 
 'Cause she knows my respect's well tall 
 Me a make her... 
 (Chorus x2: Corleon) 
 Sweat-sweat-sweat-sweat-sweat 
 Get you really wet 
 Girl I've got just what you want 
 To leave your body soaking wet. 
 (Verse 2: Sean Paul) 
 Lyrics when me target 
 Up in her rote 
 And she want me to deal with it straight off 
 Little night when the moon it shine 
 And she give me the time 
 And the clothes them taken off 
 When the tide it rise 
 And she get the surprise 
 And she just can't whip 
 For the break off 
 For the while undermine 
 She a shake and mash up the place 
 And set the ear break off 
 Well a bubble she babble 
 To the bass and a tremble 
 Ant the way how she move 
 Makes me know she a rebel 
 ??S?? to the ??P?? 
 Go on take it to the level 
 And she can't go around it 
 It's in my devil 
 Must get apart 
 'Cause she's hot like cackle 
 She alone gonna 
 Make my nerves them circle 
 My name she calls 
 For me give her it hard 
 And break down a while 
 And I know it is rebel... Bam! 
 (Chorus x2: Corleon) 
 Sweat-sweat-sweat-sweat-sweat 
 Get you really wet 
 Girl I've got just what you want 
 To leave your body soaking wet. 
 (Bridge: Corleon) 
 Gal send it on fire 
 Let's blaze it up higher 
 I want yours melt on mine 
 Put your body next to mine 
 You know I've got desire 
 You're flaming like the fire... fire... 
 (Chorus x3: Corleon) 
 Sweat-sweat-sweat-sweat-sweat 
 Get you really wet 
 Girl I've got just what you want 
 To leave your body soaking wet. 
 Tsunami!
