When dey spin up di place we a turn it up 
 Eye red, now you feel so you burn it up 
 And a sit by di kids, we a surf it up 
 We a stick to di peace, now swerving up 
 Too late to dem keep hatin' us 
 Can't nothing dem a do, ain't phasin us 
 From the side them been underrating us 
 But the girl that see some great in us 
 Aye, let's have it lovely like that you see? 
 Love the girl pretty, you can reach underneath 
 Sucka think dem a get to me 
 Dem a get fi greedy with the lovin' on it 
 All week we await fi dweet 
 All week we await fi di beat 
 It's weekend now so we can go get it on and move at full speed 
 Aye baby girl I wanna see you drop it low 
 Up up and down just like a stripper on a pole 
 Girl girl shake it up 
 Too much cone, just drink it up 
 Gyal make it like we a fuck 
 Aye girl just take it low 
 Take it low, take it low 
 Take it low, take it low 
 Take it low, take it low 
 Take it low 
 On di area live we a cruise 
 Comin' through, steady waitin for a chance 
 I love di gyal dem a blues 
 And I tell dem confuse 
 Lose that man when I'm swerving out the club 
 What di gyal I'mma do 
 Into di club, mash up the club 
 Out of the club, back to the yacht 
 That's how we do, me and di crew 
 My girl, take it all 
 Aye, let's have it lovely like that you see? 
 Love the girl pretty, you can reach underneath 
 Sucka think dem a get to me 
 Dem a get fi greedy with the lovin' on it 
 All week we await fi dweet 
 All week we await fi di beat 
 It's weekend now so we can go get it on and move at full speed 
 Aye baby girl I wanna see you drop it low 
 Up up and down just like a stripper on a pole 
 Girl girl shake it up 
 Too much cone, just drink it up 
 Gyal make it like we a fuck 
 Aye girl just take it low 
 Take it low 
 Back so sweet 
 Move yo body at full speed 
 Drop it low, drop it like full speed 
 Go go go at full speed 
 Move yo body at full speed 
 Drop it low, drop it like full speed 
 Move yo body at full speed 
 Move yo body at full speed 
 Oh oh
