Well a we say "give me the light' and "buss a bottle of Mo" 
 And a welcome people to Jamrock each and every stage show 
 Try fi overlook we dem time deh, can't do it now 
 The only sound is crickets, critics can't speak now 
 I man si di enemies a rise, ain't no surprise 
 Mi give bad man a blaze and a laugh 
 Dem a look fi my demise wid dem lies dem a work dem witchcraft 
 Pon elected and protected by the chief of staff 
 So make dem get feisty dem face will face my Clarks 
 I see di enemies a rise and don't surprise If dem line out inna chalk 
 If dem love dem life, dem watch how dem move, and mine how dem a talk 
 When the lion dem wake and roar, that mean seh no dog no bark 
 If a supn dem a prove, then a supn dem a lose when man a get dark 
 P p p plaque up inna mi head 
 Ah ignite up inna mi thoughts 
 So don't be fooling yourself and think a yuh alone smart 
 Di profit tell you seh provoke the youths not to wrath 
 Deal wid di youth dem right or else a Riot going start 
 When di lion dem a sleep, do no wake them up back 
 Mi sorry fi di sheep, leopard and di bullfrog 
 When di peace it a keep, do no get wi head hot 
 Deal wid di youth dem right or else a Riot going start 
 Deal wid di youth dem right or else a Riot going start 
 Deal wid di youth dem right or else a Riot going start 
 A Riot going start, a Riot going start 
 Deal wid di youth dem right or else a Riot going start 
 Gong Zilla, Sean paul, colder than a cold sore 
 No flaw, so sharp, wanted like a outlaw 
 Dread Locks, Mohawk, gyal no meck di road block! 
 Well a who dem Sean and which part dem come from a pose up like a wall? 
 Mi no know you know Gong, definite dem wrong, mi no trust dem none at all 
 Obviously the only outcome is that them bout fi fall 
 If dem diss we, dem wake up and see, dem life done that is all 
 Because no bwoy, no guy no fi a have man name a call 
 No day, no time mi no accept no common assault 
 Naw watch no face man a living Juggernaut 
 Man a no Bugs Bunny, Man a no Disney nor Walt 
 See dem a come and a move like dem want fi exalt 
 Have it, let dem see can easy fi get caught 
 Di profit tell you seh provoke the youths not to wrath 
 Deal wid di youth dem right or else a Riot going start 
 When di lion dem a sleep, do no wake them up back 
 Mi sorry fi di sheep, leopard and di bullfrog 
 When di peace it a keep, do no get wi head hot 
 Deal wid di youth dem right or else a Riot going start 
 Deal wid di youth dem right or else a Riot going start 
 Deal wid di youth dem right or else a Riot going start 
 A Riot going start, a Riot going start 
 Deal wid di youth dem right or else a Riot going start
