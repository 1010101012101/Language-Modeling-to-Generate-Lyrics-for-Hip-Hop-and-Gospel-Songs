They say 
 Imma hit the club, hit the wheel 
 Hit the G and the hit the train 
 Pop a by, by the by 
 Before I came through 
 I had to hit the bank 
 Always told that bitch to 
 Know that's what you niggers do 
 30 girls in the VIP 
 Got you pussy niggers boom 
 Still look at the binding to 
 While these back 
 She fuck good 
 Marvel around all through the town 
 Why bitch wanna make niggers whoo 
 Life on me now 
 In the way to get beaten now 
 All I like is stripper poles 
 And the white hoes and they underwear 
 All you bad girl, bad girl, bad girl you need is faking 
 Here come the bottles, let me watch you drink it 
 From the table to the car, from the car to the crib 
 'Cause tonight I need some entertainment 
 You bag girl, bad girl, bad girl entertainment 
 You bag girl, bad girl, bad girl entertainment 
 You bag girl, bad girl, bad girl entertainment 
 From the table to the car, from the car to the crib 
 'Cause tonight I need some entertainment 
 Don't try man, lie down 
 Hail down my back nigger 
 Everything I do is dope 
 You wouldn't think I was a crack 
 Big money, fast cars 
 Hoes all in my lap nigger 
 So far I hit the game 
 I might as well just lap nigger 
 Milk the gamin, Latin toes 
 She could see my chain from the back row 
 Came I'll to my niggers 
 Like that was some bad hoes 
 I got a black hoe, a white hoe 
 A Spanish hoe and a Chinese 
 Yea they call me 2 Chains and 
 My third chain's a Siamese 
 Ask your favorite boy 
 Whatcha gonna do for it 
 Hey girl she own the Marley 
 Think she saw it 
 No horse in the round 
 Polo drown 
 She might say yes to me and 
 Know they at 
 All you bad girl, bad girl, bad girl you need is faking 
 Here come the bottles, let me watch you drink it 
 From the table to the car, from the car to the crib 
 'Cause tonight I need some entertainment 
 You bag girl, bad girl, bad girl entertainment 
 You bag girl, bad girl, bad girl entertainment 
 You bag girl, bad girl, bad girl entertainment 
 From the table to the car, from the car to the crib 
 'Cause tonight I need some entertainment 
 Girl roll it around and turn it, turn it 
 Mable it down and pet it, pet it 
 Holding out the air, then get it, get it 
 Imma take you home and bet it 
 Hopping out at you 
 Set it out slow 
 Now whine it girl 
 All of the checks

 No ram to the daf 
 To really laugh no

 Home made with dream girl

 And know you at me on my tweet girl

 Here come the bottles, let me watch you drink it 
 From the table to the car, from the car to the crib 
 'Cause tonight I need some entertainment 
 You bag girl, bad girl, bad girl entertainment
