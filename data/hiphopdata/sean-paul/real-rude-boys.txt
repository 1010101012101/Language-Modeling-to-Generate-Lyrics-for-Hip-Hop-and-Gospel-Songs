Sean Paul: 
 Weh easy, weh ya done know so ya make on the cheesy 
 Sean-a-peesy, them girls are over breezy 
 Longside with 50 Cent yo 
 Now them bwoy waan fi them extend yo 
 Sean Paul: 
 Some bwoy fi check it 
 Jerk off madness and they no make it 
 Some pon inna the week I couldn't go home and then select it 
 Haffi get it 
 Life is gift no man a wreck it 
 But some little youth them don't get it 
 (Repeat) 
 50 Cent: 
 Them say they ready 
 But I know for sure they not ready 
 Gold is the grain and for sure they don't get it 
 4/5th pop of drop they deaded 
 Nigga come see I mean I forget it 
 Real rude boys pop off they don't want credit 
 Niggas know you did it and police know you did it 
 Whenever drama comes a real soldier don't set it 
 If it's B did it, big money bet it, in ya brain I'll imbed it 
 Don't front with 50 and Sean Paul 
 I got 50 soldiers on call ready to brawl 
 Gangsta see me on those to spray that target 
 Cause ya niggas you done know when we finished carpet 
 Yeah! 
 Sean Paul: 
 If ya take it in then ya gonna see 
 Nuff a them a rule bad man but they wanna be 
 Setting all them front up inna the club them a look upon they enemy 
 But them grow empty, no artileries yo 
 Park it and make it so that they cyah hold them stress 
 Live get tripe and them a run up inna a mess 
 When tings pop off some of them gonna get decked 
 And them haffi know them cyah hold the flex 
 Sean Paul: 
 Tell them fi check it 
 Jerk off madness and they no make it 
 Some pon inna the week I couldn't go home and then select it 
 Haffi get it 
 Life is a gift no man a wreck it 
 It's the same ting me tell them fi check it 
 50 Cent: 
 Make this money 
 Niggas like my style I'm chipped up 
 Still I won't hesitate to shoot ya whip up 
 Gully I got guns, chromes and black ones 
 Sniff nose and long joints you might wanna pack one 
 With all the bullshit goin' up in the hood 
 You need to be something shit it's on in the hood 
 Get ya ass beat up, stabbed, and shot up 
 Niggas will tear your fucking block up 
 Over some prada
