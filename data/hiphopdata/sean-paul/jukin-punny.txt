We can do anything 
 Just you and me 
 Baby, baby, baby, baby, babe 
 Wait and see 
 Hold on, sit tight 
 Are you ready for a crazy ride? 
 You're on you're own, it ain't right 
 Something's gotta give tonight 
 So if you wanna run 
 Run and disappear 
 You and I can bust our way 
 Right out of here 
 Together we can 
 Shoot the moon stop the rain 
 Even ride a hurricane if we wanna 
 Together we can walk in space 
 Save the human race 
 Do ya think we oughta, oughta? 
 Together we can 
 Shoot the moon, stop the rain 
 Even ride a hurricane if we wanna 
 Walk in space save the human race 
 Do ya think we oughta, oughta, oughta? 
 Here we take our time, we can have it all 
 I don't think we're gonna make it on our own 
 Together we can 
 Even ride a hurricane if we wanna 
 Together we can walk into space 
 Save the human race 
 Do you think we oughta, oughta, oughta? 
 Together we can
