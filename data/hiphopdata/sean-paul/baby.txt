Baby 
 (Sean Paul feat Shabba Ranks and Erupt) 
 Dreaming of future reality, 
 Well you done know say nothing can't stop me, 
 'Cause a so we drop that, 
 Yo - Sean Paul one time, 
 Nah waste no time. 
 Baby... I'll be... 
 (Representing for the black woman them) 
 Right by your side 
 When you're up or down 
 Don't matter what I'll be around (a true thing you know girl) 
 Baby... (Baby...) I'll be... (I'll be...) 
 Your baby from 9 months ago 
 Can't see a thing to make me change 
 Shabba! 
 Despite the gal hand, give them the greeting 
 Embassy Suites where we plan to have a meeting (a meeting) 
 Me plan to get evil, 
 Here's the royal baton and the meat get beaten 
 Me promise you the meat isn't something to be eaten 
 You bow down, you dutty life it nah go... 
 You don't have a liquor store but have liquor license 
 Them would a dead (deaddd) - big poison.

 Honey I'd do anything for you, 
 You drive me crazy,

 I love you baby you're so fine.

 Baby... I'll be... 
 Right by your side 
 When you're up or down 
 Don't matter what I'll still be down. 
 Girl you will always flick back on my mind, 
 Reminiscing when we kick back an' a wine**, 
 But if you gone, we still nah go cry 
 Although we calm to get a next girl you know say we no shy. 
 It's no disrespect, 
 I'm telling you my mind, 
 You know me true to you at this time, 
 A nuff other girls keep pressuring my line - 
 Ole vanity minds, so we kill them with the grind. 
 Me rate you and this is straight from the vine 
 You nuh dis, me nuh dis you, 
 Together we will shine - 
 Like the sun and the stars, 
 Together we will shine - 
 Hard struggle through life, 
 Together we will blind.

 And I've had a lot of flirts and a lot of flings girl, 
 Bare heartbreak and trouble that a bring girl, 
 So me have to turn around and give you the ring girl.
