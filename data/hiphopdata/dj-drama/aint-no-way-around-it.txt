Ain't no way around it 
 Ain't no way around it 
 Ain't no way around it 
 Ain't no way around it 
 A bitch gon' be a bitch 
 A hoe gon' be a hoe 
 A killer gon' be a killer 
 That's sumthin' you need to know 
 Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it 
 A dealer gon' be a dealer 
 A player gon' be a player 
 My niggas, them my niggas, they just like blood 
 Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it 
 I had a young, hot thang fucked my bro and gave 'em brain 
 And she expect for me to love her, I can never be a lame 
 I'm attracted to her sexually, but she ain't my main dame 
 We can be the best of friends, shawty, but you off the chain 
 See I ain't gonna hold it against ya 
 I'ma keep it pimpin' with ya 
 Don't you come at me with issues 
 Ain't tryna get all in your mixture 
 I ain't tryna come to get ya 
 You can meet me somewhere on Peachtree 
 At the W on the Fourteenth ain't tryna fuck no hoe tryna know me 
 Know they fuck my woodie, already smashed on home beach 
 Half of these bitches phony, singing love songs like Toni 
 Ms. Braxton you the action, stop actin' 
 Just another sad love song waitin' to happen 
 A bitch gon' be a bitch 
 A hoe gon' be a hoe 
 A killer gon' be a killer 
 That's sumthin' you need to know 
 Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it 
 A dealer gon' be a dealer 
 A player gon' be a player 
 My niggas, them my niggas, they just like blood 
 Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it 
 Strapped with that flame and he ready to bust a brain 
 You can't tell the homie nothing, he done felt too much pain 
 He don't care nuttin' 'bout no fame, he addicted to the game 
 Some niggas rob, some niggas slang, do whatever to maintain 
 Travel all the way to Waco, get them numbers for the low-low 
 Bigger the risk, the bigger the check, we watch for po-po 
 Make sure you keep your eyes on, when you're drivin' down 1-0 
 That interstate ain't no joke when you're ridin' with Coco 
 When you got hands like these you can count money with your eyes closed 
 When you spend cheese like this you send killers to niggas front door 
 Half of these niggas front fo', bitches for extra convo 
 Really plugged in with migo, go blind and still can see notes 
 A bitch gon' be a bitch 
 A hoe gon' be a hoe 
 A killer gon' be a killer 
 That's sumthin' you need to know 
 Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it 
 A dealer gon' be a dealer 
 A player gon' be a player 
 My niggas, them my niggas, they just like blood 
 Ain't no way around it, ain't no way around it
