A cocaina cowboy, got ounces in my house boy 
 Bricks stashed in the basement, case a drought I bring 'em out, boy 
 And I wipe you out, boy, without leaving my house, boy 
 Remember that before you open up yo' mouth, boy 
 Yo' woman give me nice jaw, say that you her boy toy 
 She just give me la choy, treat her like you like her 
 Breaking down ten bails of kush, I think I need a lighter 
 Pulled up in my spiker but rolled off in my spider 
 Thinking like a miser, I'm acting like a tiger 
 20 bails and show yo' nigga 850 an hour 
 Gucci Mane and Willie Kid, you silly bitch 
 The stupidest critics try to rate dis shit 
 Affiliate the animal, so icey the cannibal 
 I pistol whip yo' manager, scratch off in the challenger 
 Vacation in Canada, drop dis shit like dinosaur 
 40 bones wrapped up wit fruti, all 'em bitches gotta go 
 I stepped up my visuals, mo' diamonds than yo' jeweler hoe 
 Gucci Mane, so Icey got mo' diamonds than a jewelry store 
 Mo' diamonds than a jewelry store Gucci 
 You talking money niggas, you talking hoes nigga 
 You talking dope nigga, don't want no smoke nigga 
 I take advantage, make a body vanish 
 Then I vanish in the vanquish, my white boys 
 And Candace got choppas for the low, we moving snow avalanches 
 Never folding like a pamphlet or flaking like it's dandruff 
 Control like damage, catch me on the yacht 
 Sleeping good on a hammock but hood like a sugar sandwich 
 Put a bandage on my cuts, VVS man 
 I put a bullet in you and man, yeah, yes man 
 Willie the kid, I'm a decorated soldier 
 And I'm stacking bills like Oldsmo, Vaseline and foldgers 
 Kerosene and loads of brown paper bags 
 Cash Money like it's krogers, hood stock holders 
 Stashing never visit the banks much 
 I put you niggas in the paint like a paint brush 
 Me and Gucci roll like sushi, bubble like Jacuzzi 
 Closet full of coogi muthafucker 
 You talking money nigga, you talking hoes nigga 
 You talking dope nigga don't want no smoke nigga 
 Smoke and worth it fool, keep yo' cool 
 If you do hide yo' plate 'cause we gon' eat yo' food 
 I got some men I swear will come up out the cuts in groups 
 Ain't wearing jerseys but they came out to the courts to shoot 
 You don't want that smoke, boy, I got that choke smoke 
 Throat hitter shots, you don't believe me nigga watch 
 See that's how niggas die, trying to know who and why 
 (Unverified) 
 You the reason yo' whole crew got popped 
 Popped the rugger top drove half dis nigga head off 
 His brain sitting 'em like its in a drop 
 I'm riding hollow tips, 'em ain't spinning Daytons 
 Keep smoke around me like I'm Sammy Davis 
 Kush smoking got a nigga looking half Asian 
 Rolled it up on [unverified] and 20 due in 80 
 Seem like these niggas hate it since I'm affiliated 
 I throw 'em E's and 'em A's just to initiate it
