Love love love like this 
 Gotta be something for me write this 
 I'm sayin' one night my love is like that 
 Shawty don't like me then shawty don't like dick 
 You know that love is a very serious thing 
 If you don't watch out 
 Love is gonna get you 
 She say she love me more than anything 
 I tell her anything I'm such a rumor I never hear her wedding ring 
 Bad women with bad figures, I'm trying to get em 
 My bread grown, my sex better, my mind different 
 And you would think that I'm European, my tribe different 
 I'm not a mister but I've been playing with side bitches other plan w 
 My game tighter than bitches that ain't fuck in forever 
 Ok drama the affiliate 
 Bitches think I'm trippin' but I Ramen noodle dinner Em' 
 Just before they seen my money in the green 
 You niggas in the red, I am somewhat the illiterate 
 She wanna see me again, She trying see me for dinner 
 I'm trying to see her in bed 
 Don't like to see when she talk 
 I like to see where she been and I'll be deep in her mind 
 'Cause I'll be deep in her ribs 
 Can't break up to make up, she wake up, I'm out 
 And I make her lips stick, no make up to mouth 
 Ugh, and that's gross but she love it though 
 A nigga ghost every time youngin on the flow 
 And when she not, have her feeling like she on a boat 
 Used to nun-chuck em, now I got to Donatello Bow 
 Ha, this is something they already know 
 They more they come, the less likely the want to go 
 Wale 
 It's my fault 
 I should have known from the start boy 
 I'm that you would go and steal my heart away 
 I'm drowning down, I couldn't dodge the wave 
 Somebody save me babe 
 You remind me of a love I used to know 
 Playing with fire is a danger zone 
 I wish I'll never see you again 
 I wish I'll never see you again 
 I wish I'll never see you again 
 I wish I'll never see you again 
 Everything was picture perfect till you moved the frame 
 And now because of you It's barely hangin' 
 Boy in a flash it's like you start to replace him 
 That photograph is fading 
 You remind me of a love I used to know 
 Playin' with fire is a danger zone 
 I wish I'll never see you again 
 I wish I'll never see you again 
 I wish I'll never see you again 
 I wish I'll never see you again 
 From the time that you stole my heart 
 You shook my world and it felt apart 
 Trying to get away, but I think I'm stuck 
 Trying to get back to this thing called love 
 I wish I'll never see you again 
 I wish I'll never see you again
