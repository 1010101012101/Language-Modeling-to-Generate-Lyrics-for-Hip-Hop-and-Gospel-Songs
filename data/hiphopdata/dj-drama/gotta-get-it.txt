Verse 1 (B.G.) 
 Uh huh 
 In my city nigga life like a chess game 
 Uptown anybody could be next mane 
 I switch lanes on em 
 Reverse the game on em 
 It's a must to stay a couple of steps ahead on em 
 I've been out shit 
 Survived the worst shit 
 I mean I was really on some heat first shit 
 Stalked a nigga put him on a t shirt shit 
 Then go to the funeral and carry the herse shit 
 Yeah its real in the field nigga and what 
 I still hustle shine and get my sex up 
 I still grind fuck 'em what ima slack what 
 They pop drama but they bounce right back uh 
 Gotta get that money gotta get that 
 Gotta get that money gotta get that 
 Gotta get that money gotta get that 
 You know where the licks at nigga where the bricks at 
 Verse 2 Soulja slim
