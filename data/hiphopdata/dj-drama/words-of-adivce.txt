(Chorus - Kevin Cossom) 
 You better think before you speak 
 Got to recognize, naw man you know me 
 Here's a few words of advice, better act right 
 I promise (Promise) 
 I promise (Promise) 
 And don't leave your girl around me 
 I know she do what she want 
 What's going to happen when she leave? 
 Here's a few words of advice, better act right 
 I promise (Promise) 
 I promise (Promise) 
 (Verse 1 - Lil Wayne) 
 Long ass money, short ass temper 
 Big fucking gun, soft ass trigger 
 Weezy F. Baby and the F is for fuck them hoes 
 Got your girl walking around my crib in her underclothes 
 White man money, tight pants thugging 
 Pussy think it's sweet then I Sprite can crush them 
 I ain't got nothing but some weed and some bitches 
 You niggas ain't eating, clean ass dishes 
 Gangsta Grillz bitch, I am still the dentist 
 Hit this motherfucker, like Willy McGuiness 
 I coach the winners, they throw Gatorade on me 
 Silent .45, Potato Head on it 
 Ask me how I'm doing, I'm day-today homie 
 These bitches on my back, I fade away on them 
 Young Tune, no Bugs Bunny bitch 
 And as long as I got a voice, I'm talking Young Money shit, nigga 
 (Verse 2 - Mack Maine) 
 Young Money bitch 
 Young Money sick 
 Now shut the fuck up and suck a Young Money dick 
 Velcro on my aces sticking to the basics 
 Black, white, and black pinky ring 
 I'm looking like a racist 
 I'm higher than a satellite 
 You just a hermaphrodite 
 I've been real since B.C., guess this is the after life 
 Drop out from Heavens like, just to raise plenty hell 
 Boy I'm trying to touch a billion bucks before 2012 
 So that mean I'm focused 
 Peep my demeanor 
 These bitches talking dirty to me 
 Take them to the cleaners 
 They say men are from Mars 
 And say women from Venus 
 But I'm in my space shuttle 
 About to serve them like subpoenas 
 These niggas keep me laughing, like hyenas 
 They only show they guns, Gilbert Arenas 
 What's up Serena? You could be my baby momma 
 I'm with Barack O-Drama 
 This Young Money's Obama
