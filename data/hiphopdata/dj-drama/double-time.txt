(Drama) 
 Y'all act like ya heard me 
 Instead of bustin' my chopper man 
 I kiss down on dirt (say what) goin' be in my heart 
 Cause A-T-L where I'm from 
 And everywhere be my stompin ground with 3-4-5 ya heard (I heard) 
 We trane as we kill'em, and no low limit were wit'em 
 I thought ya taught like ya succas, I can tell when you're weak 
 That's why I lead to tough succas low haters low punk now friends 
 Hatin' on drama goin' get you coward 
 And that means 
 Ooh I got my jeans and my boots 
 Ooh I'm tight wit my troops 
 Ooh My left, right, my left, Ooh lord I'm tight to def 
 Tight to def! 
 (Drama) 
 See I'm a walk like a soujah, stay in TV told ya 
 I left right, come look here boy, I done told him where I'm from 
 It ain't no luck, that's the killaz, that's the fiends 
 From down south, don't charge us with them means 
 We don't bring it don't slang it 
 If it don't walk it don't talk it 
 Either go leave the house and bring your pistal and amor (what) 
 With D-R-A-M-A goin' do you like rambo 
 A ten top about fate give me this shit 
 Foward march 
 (Drama) 
 Line em' up shoot em' down (uh huh) like Adolf Hitler (say what) 
 He talking the talk nigga walk the walk 
 I don't get down wit no succas, I roll with killaz and high rolls 
 (I guarantee) smoke rolls like dojahs 
 Can't get buck I done told ya (can't get me scared) 
 I'm tight like the 5s---8 and you wearing the twelve 
 I'ma bust y'all bustaz style the cut to brains (ok) 
 Burn in the fire punk like a really hot clothes hanger 
 Blast'em to my last clip 
 My last on I holla out 
 (Drama) 
 Tight to def 
 For the 2000 y'all 
 We done tooked over
