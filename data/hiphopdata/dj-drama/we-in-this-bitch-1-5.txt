Okay, you know you been on my mind 
 A-town I miss you and ol' girl will come late 
 And bring all her tips through 
 Break up her weed while I break down my issues 
 Get paper she blows that 
 The next day you know thaaat 
 Day dream at night time I think too much 
 Then I hit the night club till its day time 
 And I drink too much 
 Not time for no good girl 
 They hold on and they clinge to much 
 I just wanna hood bitch that tells me that I sing too much 
 Ah yeah shout out to the women playing y'all position 
 I be movin' through my city like a politician 
 Hope you don't judge me 
 'Cause me and you are not all that different 
 You made me this way, you made me famous 
 You all assisted 
 New niggas tryna shine 
 I didn't condone it 
 But I'm back in this bitch 
 Reliving the moment 
 I'm about to have it popping off again 
 Drama 'bout to make it rain on Mary Poppins 
 And her friends 
 We got money in our pocket, and whatever you're sipping on 
 Red-bottom limping around this bitch, what the fuck you tripping on? 
 Twenty goons, they in this bitch, you better check your tone 
 And they gon put you back in place if you do something wrong 
 We in this bitch, yeah we in this bitch 
 We got a section full of girls and they barely speak any English 
 Let's toast it up to that life and I mean it 
 Water water all around me, damn my diamonds is shinnin' 
 Money raining on your bitch and Future changin' the climate 
 All I hang around is millionaires and a bunch of cons 
 Turn up, turn up, turn up it's like I burped a bunch of suns 
 Ha, from NY back to Atlanta they put my lifestyle on camera 
 Ain't trippin' I'm cockin' hammers addicted to makin' movies 
 I like 'em when the boojie anytime I step out when I come through it's a movie 
 I ain't rappin' to you, I'm into trappin' with words 
 And I ain't braggin' to you when I say I'm fly as a bird 
 That girl don't speak no Englo' but she know all my lingo 
 She know a robin when she see one and she know a C-Note 
 I got a hatian girl speak creole and a Spanish girl from Rio 
 When you put 'em in a room together make a perfect combo 
 They bout' that life I'm 'bout that life yes we is yes we is 
 The money bitches and cars come with the life that I live 
 It shoulda' been a designer party all this designer 'round me 
 Pick a name anything money could buy with diamond chains 
 Diamond rings murcielagos valenciagos we toast it up to the life nigga this ours 
 We got money in our pocket, and whatever you're sipping on 
 Red-bottom limping around this bitch, what the fuck you tripping on? 
 Twenty goons, they in this bitch, you better check your tone 
 And they gon put you back in place if you do something wrong 
 We in this bitch, yeah we in this bitch 
 We got a section full of girls and they barely speak any English 
 Let's toast it up to that life and I mean it
