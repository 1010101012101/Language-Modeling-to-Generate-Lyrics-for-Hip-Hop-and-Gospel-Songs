Enemy... (enemy...) 
 Andre 3000: 
 Verse One: 
 So I'm watchin' her fine ass 
 Walked to my bedroom, and thought to myself 
 That's the shape of things to come 
 She said, "Why you in the club, and you don't make it precipitate? 
 You know, make it rain when you can make it thunderstorm" 
 I'm like, "Why? " 
 The world needs sun 
 The hood needs funds 
 There's a war going on and half the battle is guns 
 How dare I throw it on the floor 
 When people are poor 
 So I write like Edgar Allen to restore, got a cord? [?] 
 Umbilical attached to a place they can't afford 
 No landscaping, Or window draping 
 This old lady told me, 
 "If I ain't got nothin' good, say nathing" 
 That's why I don't talk much 
 I swear it don't cost much, to pay attention to me 
 I tell like it is, and I tell it how it could be 
 The hood be 
 Requesting my services, Oh don't get nervous it's 
 Step yo game up time, These ain't them same old rhymes 
 Designed to have you dancin' in some club 
 Niggas write to me 
 Woman be up in they tub 
 Expoliating with hey pom poms 
 Yellin' "GO 3000! " 
 I'm in my whatever bumpin' what? 
 A 100 miles in 
 Runnin' Runnin' Runnin' Runnin' 
 Summon 
 Woman 
 Come in 
 Sit down, heard you need some plumbing 
 Done and 
 I'm in 
 A swell mood 
 A rather swoll mood 
 Until she told me that she told (?) 
 That's she'll be back, she's going to the store 
 I didn't know she had a boyfriend, so the door 
 I pointed her too 
 I said, "Call me when y'all break up 
 I don't fuck nobody bitch" 
 And never only Jacob, know what time it is 
 Nigga just tryin' to live 
 Like a Nigga suppose to live 
 If I still drink that malt liquor 
 I pour that beer 
 On the ground for niggas not around 
 I started out starvin' 
 Now they got me out here Brett Farve'n 
 Try'n to see if I still got it... (got it...) 
 I guess it's like the right thing about it... ('bout it...) 
 (Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius)
