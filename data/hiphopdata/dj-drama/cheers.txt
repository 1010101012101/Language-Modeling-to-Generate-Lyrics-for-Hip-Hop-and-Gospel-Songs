Making your way in the world today 
 Takes everything you've got. 
 Taking a break from all your worries, 
 Sure would help alot. 
 Wouldn't you like to get away? 
 All those nights when you've got no lights, 
 The check is in the mail; 
 And your little angel 
 Hung the cat up by its tail; 
 And your third fiance didn't show; 
 Sometimes you want to go 
 Where everybody knows your name, 
 And they're always glad you came; 
 You want to be where you can see, 
 Our troubles are all the same; 
 You want to be where everybody knows your name. 
 Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead; 
 The morning's looking bright; 
 And your shrink ran off to Europe, 
 And didn't even write; 
 And your husband wants to be a girl; 
 Be glad there's one place in the world 
 Where everybody knows your name, 
 And they're always glad you came; 
 You want to go where people know, 
 People are all the same; 
 You want to go where everybody knows your name. 
 Where everybody knows your name, 
 And they're always glad you came; 
 Where everybody knows your name, 
 And they're always glad you came...
