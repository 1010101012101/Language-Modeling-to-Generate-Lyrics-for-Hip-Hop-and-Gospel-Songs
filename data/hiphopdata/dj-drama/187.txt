(Project Pat) 
 Yeah Project Pat up in this dang thang 
 Crook by da book, the fed story 
 Y'all know how we do 
 We do it like it sposed to be done 
 The dirty dirty strapped with the gun 
 Y'all know how we ride, homicide 
 Y'all know how we do 
 187 on a punk 
 Y'all know how we get down 
 Let the bullets start talkin' 
 That's how we do the walkin' 
 Y'all know how we get down north (north, north) 
 (Project Pat) 
 Patty cake, patty cake, stack the money off the plates 
 In a field, you remain 
 You gon make me keep the blades 
 Sucky boys, bring the noise 
 Smoke you like a kush bubble 
 I'm the president of Drama 
 Guess you get some kush trauma 
 Haters hurl up, lighten up, 'cause they broke niggas 
 Hittin up a punk, cut his throat 
 Call them folk niggas 
 Hurt your mouth, hot in these streets 
 Hood banga, ride by your house 
 Wit the cake, let it bang ya 
 Project pat, still in business 
 On some handguns 
 Niggas get to screamin out ya guy when the lead gun 
 If ya think ya quick, Drama go in ya bullet 
 I'm head buttin suckas in the head wit these bullets 
 Now if ya wanna ya can get it no problem 
 Glock go blocka, blocka, blocka, blow 
 Now if ya wanna ya can get it I ain't trippin' 
 Its 187 on a mothafuckin fool 
 (8Ball) 
 Big hat, low walkas, low custom fours oh 
 Put my pants down back, pockets almost all the flow 
 I don't wanna touch it but the bad boy out in public 
 If a nigga disresepect it then the trigga is the subject 
 Take it how ya wanna take it, test it then, shit was fake 
 Lookin' at your mama from the casket cryin after weight 
 I make dough 
 Pimp niggas like we bake the cake 
 Sit up in restaurants and get my fill on big ol steaks 
 I hope I'm never that poor nigga seein blood, runnin' 
 Can't bleed 'cause the shots took away half your tummy 
 On your knees beggin Lord please not now 
 Knock on wood, count your blessings while you still around 
 (MJG) 
 Look, look into the rearview 
 Nigga followin me he got a slash on the gas 
 No, fuck that slam on the brakes 
 Jump out wit the pump and blast on his ass 
 M Tight MJG, you don't really wanna come with the fo-fo 
 When the low low bringin' everybody get out the way 
 And ain't playin', but ya don't move 
 Goin' get a hold every little mothafucka 
 Still roll by, still gon slide with blood all ova 
 Anything that ya step by I work for Pat mothafucka 
 Me and him I, put in some work 
 I did my dirt, I did some bad, I did some good 
 You can bring in any kinda wig ya wanna in bring boy 
 I don't think ya really wanna bring it to the hood 
 Go brang yo bitch, do yo thang, then it don't matta bout who you claim 
 It don't really matta what another mothafucka do 
 When it's all over with you the man 
 Don't make me get buck with the AK 
 'Cause it may spray and it may shoot and it may hit 
 Anybody that ya live or you stay wit 
 That's how worse than the average day hit, shit
