Oh 
 As the city lights up the night 
 I feel so 
 Good 'cause I did it my way 
 And I know 
 That I'm just livin' the life of girls and gold 
 And I feel so good 
 'Cause I did it my way 
 Nice bright light Vegas 
 The life of girls and gold is so contagious 
 I been cold, took the C.O double-M road? 
 Hangin' out the windows 
 Reachin' for the world as the wind blows 
 The crescendo of my career loud in your ear, ear 
 I'm proud to be here 
 Now that we here 
 This year, you can find me at the Cosmopolitan 
 Holding bottles never bottled in 
 Probably wish 
 Black girls modellin', looking for a followin' 
 Attitude is tolerant, I'm married to the game like Solomon 
 These rings represent the dreams 
 We got from the old folk, yearning for the gold coast 
 My soul spoke things that was necessary 
 Found forever in ways that are legendary 
 And through the drama, I stuck to my Common-tary 
 Now that everyday man say that comm is every-where 
 Oh 
 As the city lights up the night 
 I feel so 
 Good 'cause I did it my way 
 And I know 
 That I'm just livin' the life of girls and gold 
 And I feel so good 
 'Cause I did it my way 
 I had a dream of visine, now I see it clearer 
 How surprising I'm admiring that mirror 
 I'm inspiring the finer things in life 
 And your time is slowly expiring 
 You're crying me a river 
 That's ironic, she had 
 I like to swim in it, Olympians YSL 
 Her Timberlands high as hell 
 The ceiling is an understatement 
 I burn through it, proof it's a fire drill 
 Fire hoes, bad bitches fire hoes 
 Fire then re-hire hoes 
 Her entire crew is tired of the liars that you running by her 
 I can see you hoe 
 Plenty priors of a fuck nigga 
 Nigger I suppose, I can fly her 
 Put her in the attire of designer clothes 
 Dayton wires on the Chevy 
 Why are you not tryna ball? 
 Don't you know they already fuck me 
 I'm a made man 
 Maids in the mansion, clean them up, out here 
 Oh 
 As the city lights up the night 
 I feel so 
 Good 'cause I did it my way 
 And I know 
 That I'm just livin' the life of girls and gold 
 And I feel so good 
 'Cause I did it my way
