 Get on the microphone and just rip the track 
 Verse 1: Shaq 
 Who the hell is Shaq Attack you'd better read the paper 
 Treat me like Biz Markie you'd better catch a vapor 
 I've got mad props so why would you exploit 
 Punch you in your face like that kid from Detroit 
 Really yo you'd better ask MC Hammer 'bout this bad mama jama 
 Tall kid with the hoopa hypa lipta-gramma 
 Watch out yo it's time for MC bashin' 
 Got more loot than my man Johnny Cash and 
 I'm hard like a 360 twice jam 
 Ask Dr. Dre and Ed Lover who's the man 
 I'm sure they'll say me brother please don't play me like a shrimp 
 Dunk it on your head then I'll point like Shawn Kemp 
 Don't need the drink crooked I juice to get loose 
 My favorite cartoon is Bullwinkle the Moose 
 I'm 'bout to sting you like rubbing alcohol 
 Yes yes y'all call me Ed Jones 'cause I'm too tall 
 Put the rhyme between my legs then I'll score 
 Never mind a whore I want to do a phat tour 
 Come freak the style that the big Michelle display 
 You know the style that be my fortee

 Get on the microphone and rip a funky track 
 Verse 2: Phife 
 It's the Phife and Shaq mission plus Shaheed's got the goods 
 Making rough daddy jams knocking harder than wood 
 Make ya boogie with the fly armstrong crew 
 Phife Dawg and Shaq Fu this is how we do 
 Funky renditions there's no competiton 
 Split MC's apart as if their group was New Edition 
 Make MC's hush stop look and listen 
 It's hard to comprehed so they commence to remincising 
 Far from an amateur microhpone damager 
 End your whole career beat down your manager 
 Never was a herb kick you to the curb 
 There's more to my attitude than the city of Johanesburg 
 Styles are mean but this year they're even meaner 
 Carrying chips on my shoulder so call me Sarafina 
 Gaurantee ?? martin pissin' and a fartin' 
 Mess around with this and you'll be on a milk carton 
 MC's don't like me I say tough titties 
 Blow up the spot like my man from Jersey City 
 People always askin' 'why is Phife so cocky?' 
 I gotta be good at something 'cause I can't play hockey 
 You know the status and the status is live 
 The first draft-pick for the label called Jive 
 Yo Shaq, where ya at?

 Phife, I'm right here 
 Yo Shaq, where ya at 
 Phife, I'm right here 
 Yo Shaq, where ya at?

 Yo Shaq, where ya at?

 You can't front on the track 'cause the track is phat 
 Verse 3: Shaq, Phife 
 Yo here I am again you'd better call the cops 
 Pump up your Reeboks and ya just don't stop 
 I got mad styles you better sit and watch 
 I can kick it like he-he then I'll grab my crotch 
 Yo it's 1993 I mean nineteem-ninety-Shaq 
 Whatever year it is the Shaq will never slack 
 Giving mad shouts to my homeys up in New Or' 
 On and off the court you know I do her 
 Peace to that dog and peace to this dog 
 Here comes the Phife Dawg aka the top dog 
 World's greatest 5-footer as if you didn't know 
 Rhymes are like the Lord's lessons they constantly flow 
 MC's need to step on you see it is to ??? 
 As long as the mic's on that's when I get my run on 
 Battle anybody come bring your whole crew 
 You want the short black eskimo come see me in my igloo 
 Nasty like vomit couldn't clean it with comet 
 Psycho like the Lords crazy like Onyx 
 Forget the he's and she's and concentrate just on the flow 
 Phife Dawg sigining off enjoy the rest of the show
