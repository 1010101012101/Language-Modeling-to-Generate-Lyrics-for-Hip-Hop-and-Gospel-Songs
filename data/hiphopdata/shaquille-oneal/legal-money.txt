(Prodigy) 
 From Orlando to Queensboro 
 The Infamous Mobb 
 Get on your job kid 
 Word up 
 Check it out son 
 Superman emblem 
 Met with the Mobb in Metropolis 
 We call assembely, at round table mappin' out the 
 Strategy, my faculty is Warren Allen 
 Know for four poundedly 
 Hittin' up rappers till they can't be 
 Highly exsplosive, this ain't your is rap exclusive 
 Leave 'em hung, and Shaq, frontin' (shhhh) is a nusiance 
 Thirty two, and somethin' for you and you 
 And him too 
 Superman'll hold the pill, rhyme Vanderbilt 
 Leavin' niggas in stand still

 We hydro, from Orlando to Queensboro 
 Sit back, watchin' ESPN on the eighty inch 
 The game's on, my thug's on too 
 Me and Nate Dogg 
 The guard jet ski 
 Shaq ripped the river apart 
 You ain't been doin' this, so don't start 
 Hey yo, I'm tryin' to get this money 
 There's nothin' like legal money 
 Stackin' the cake makes rainy days sunny 
 One lump sum, blue chips and checks 
 So I can play 
 My way, all day, everyday 
 (Shaq) 
 Lyrical proufoundest like Mobb Deep 
 Mission on earth 
 Bust 'em speakers in jeeps 
 Phrase of day, don't y'all sleep on Shaq 
 I reconstruct abstract facts and visuals 
 Clocks speakers at Foot Locker for risiduals 
 I'm beyond understanding, mystical 
 Of the world is super ???, physical 
 Very lyrical (very lyrical) 
 My style is tongue slashing 
 As well as brain smashing 
 Like in your (shhh) kid, without asking 
 Critics be jealous, they absent minded of course 
 First MC ever to have mics and shoes in the Source 
 But of course, I ride that white horse 
 I'm unbeliavble like Biggie 
 I represent Newark, New Jersey 
 No diggety 
 Puttin' this down for my fam in the future 
 Into my center, pull out size duece duece boots 
 Than I'll boot ya 
 Age twenty four, y'all gon' see me in history books 
 Omega sci-fi represent, throw up them hooks 
 (Havoc) 
 The unbeliavble mystic, top notch 
 So cock the pist', forty first side be lifted 
 Drama we wit' it, teflon 
 Recommended, fully automatic, approved 
 Get that vest ready 
 Shook ones, throw on your running shoes 
 We runnin' crews 
 Danger, without the warning 
 Night without the morning 
 Dawn to dusk, you'll get that mug rushed 
 Cream is a must 
 So in myself I trust 
 Trust nobody else 
 And make moves with delf 
 Legalize is wise guys Queensbridge enterprise 
 Take this money rock, to all my shorties, keep it tight 
 No doubt, we gon' start, me and my Infamous click 
 Nine six to the year Two-G, handle your business 
 Get dough 
 Sip the Alaze everyday, all day 
 Pop the bubbley 
 You ain't got nothin' for me 
 We shinin', still shinin', combinin' 
 Working, diamond mindin' 
 Kid you still searchin' 
 Jealous and gellin' 
 Care less, records is sellin' 
 Platinumn plates, laid back 
 Life is great 
 And good to us 
 Pay checks, give me that head rush 
 That early mornin' thoughts is that I need more c 
 So it's on, yo what he say, I'd be right back 
 It's like that 
 And Diesel Shaq got my back 
 (Havoc) 
 Yeah, Mobb Deep 
 Big Shaq on ya back 
 Get ready for attack 
 'Cause it's like that 
 Ha
