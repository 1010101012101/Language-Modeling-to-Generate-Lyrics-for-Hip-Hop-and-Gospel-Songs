Intro (Shaq): 
 Yo Jef, why don't you give me a hoopa beat or something, something I can go 
 To the park to, 
 Yeah, there you go, all right, I like that, I like that, 
 It sound dope, 
 (Bust 'em in the eye Shaq) 
 (Verse 1: Shaq) 
 You wanna fight? come fight me, 
 I'll hit ya with the "wa-psh-psh-psh", see, see 
 I get dirty after dark, I'll treat like Speilberg, 
 You get your ass kicked in the park, 
 (Ooh) 
 You don't believe me, the proof is in the pudding, 
 Little boy in the hood, way before Cuba Gooding, 
 I flip scrpits with the mad pa-style, freeze 
 Music please, 
 I dribble rhymes like Basketball-ems, 
 People call me E.T., 
 (What's that Shaq man?) 
 Extra-Tallems, 
 You better than Shaq-tack, fool, shut up liar, 
 I lean on the statue of liberty when I get tired, 
 Than I'll punch you in the stomach, I don't give a heck, 
 (Hey yo, why you bug a hooker like that?) 
 Yo, she breated on my neck, 
 People walk around like y'all, they got charred, 
 But I'm big like Gorilla, 6-7, large, 
 I kick rhymes like moduck-kwong you, 
 I smoke-smoke the mic-mic, 
 I Chech and Chong you, 
 You don't like Shaq, frankly I don't give a damn, 
 I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man, 
 (Verse 2: Def Jef) 
 Suprise, look who's back, 
 Not a prize from a cracker jack, 
 Look at that, it's Def Jef with the Shaq Attack, 
 Flexin', I'll be crackin' your back with the boom-boom-bap, 
 Pass the mic over here, you ain't gon' want it back, 
 Everybody said I got fat, yep, but so did my wallet, 
 Still ripping rhymes and dropping bombs like Ali, Mohammed 
 Do yourself a solid, don't flex, you go sex, 
 You know the time, get the hard hat, the rolex, 
 The way I see, if I was wack like you I'd be at me, 
 The way I hold it down, you'd swear my name was Gravity, 
 Def Jef with the funk, Def Jef don't front, you know how the name is spelt, 
 I'm making it vital, my title, fool, break yourself, 
 Attack the track like Shaq on a whack broad, 
 Coming up with the hits, and I'm coming down with the backboard, 
 Don't fake the funk, just make the sound's up from the trunk, 
 The reason your tape didn't hit the deck is because your hits don't bump, 
 So get back, ain't no hassle, cause you ain't holding nothin', 
 Keep sticking around, you get beat down like you stole something, 
 Sleep on me and the Shaq and ??? your own???, 
 'Cause I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man, 
 (Def Jef) 
 Ah yeah, y'all don't know nothing about this, 
 The Shaq man's in the arsenal, 
 What's up like that, 
 Double XL in the nine-ohs kid, 
 Skills to make mills, 
 Big up, Flava Unit, Funky Town, ya ??? large, 
 So check this out Shaq man, we gon' let this beat play right here, let all 
 The brothers and sister know... 
 (Shaq) 
 Nah, nah, let me continue 
 I'm a be like D-Rock and see what's next on the menu, 
 Mic-checka, the rim and rhyme wrecka, 
 Rocks from here to Mecca, 
 Boom shack-a-lak-a-lak-a, 
 I got a hand that'll rock ya cradle, 
 Cream you like cheese, spread you on my bagle, 
 My Ford Explorer boomin' with the clumped-up funk, 
 All you jealous punks can't stop my dunks, 
 They're brand new like Heavy, 
 Built like Chevy, Impala, 
 But Shaq's a smooth balla, 
 (Yeah, but what about rhymin?) 
 I can hold my own, 
 Knick-knack shaq-attack, give a dog a bone, 
 Rhymin is like hoopin', I'm already a legend, 
 Back in the days in the Fush-camp section, 
 Used to kick rhymes like baby, baby, baby, 
 Every once, every twice, three times a lady, 
 Is what I listend to, riding with my moms, 
 How you like me now? I drop bombs, 
 When you see me, please tap my hands, 
 I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man 
 (Outro: Shaq) 
 I'd like to give a shout-out to my boy Uzi, Def Jef, Little Swany, Meech, 
 Ron Mac, and my other cousin Ron, 
 This is another rough shot from the arsenal, 
 And you know what. booty rappers, stay booty, 
 Ha-ha-ha, and we out, 
 Ah ha ha ha ha, 
 Ah ha ha ha ha, 
 Ah... psyche
