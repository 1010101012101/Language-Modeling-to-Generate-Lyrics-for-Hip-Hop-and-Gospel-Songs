Verse One: Shaquille O'Neal 
 You can't stop it, block it, when I drop it, 
 Anytime I go rhyme for rhyme on a topic, 
 You ain't even fit to step in Shaq's arena, 
 I look into your mind and I see your shook demeanor, 
 In your eyes, why are you surprised, 
 No matter how you try, I'm fly as eliquie, 
 The new edition, is this the end of your last night, 
 In the day time you couldn't see me with a flashlight, 
 I crash flights on sights of my enemies, 
 I'm comin' through, and then I bomb your whole vicinity, 
 Why they actin' fakin jacks, you're not a friend of me, 
 I peeped your card, you're not as hard as you pretend to be, 
 Who wanna spark it, with the chocolate macademian, 
 Hand clean to the cranium, 
 You know the name, Shaq aim to maintain, 
 Money on the brain, can't stop the reign 
 You can't stop the reign, 
 When it starts to fall, 
 There's no one else to blame, 
 You can't unlock that door, 
 Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G. 
 It's knee-deep with killers, about million-dollar figures, 
 Blessin' ------ that act legends, and vigers, 
 Cream lizards, cream coochies, I do my duty 
 As long as they fly as me, and high as me, 
 Success of my circle, try to break it, I'll hurt you, 
 Ain't no gettin' out that, I doubt that, 
 We want the exotic, erotic ladies, 
 Not them toxic ladies, that burn I lot, 
 I learned alot, from chunkies to ruffians, 
 From being tied up by Columbians, cause 80 grams was missin', 
 Listen, had to change my position, 
 From wanting to be large to head ------ in charge, 
 My garage, call it Selo, 4-5's and 6's, honeys by the mixes, 
 If it ain't broke don't fix it, 
 Smoke out with Leo, Biggie Tarantino, 
 Size like a sumo, franc wad numero uno, 
 Verse Three 
 Shaquille O'Neal: 
 7-0, towerin inferno, 
 Invincible smooth individual, 
 Who wanna test it, forgein or domestic, 
 No matter where you're from, I'm not the one you wanna mess wit', 
 Original with this style, livin' lavish, 
 Private jets to let my shorty shop in Paris, 
 I'm not the average, I'm far from the norm, 
 It's Daddy Long, keepin' it warm, hitting them strong, 
 Notorious B.I.G.: 
 A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women, 
 Bringin' in to G-minumums to condos with elevators in them, 
 Vehicles with telivision's in them, 
 Watch they entoruage turn your's to just mirages, 
 Disaperin acts, strictly nines and macs, 
 Killers be sureal, Copperfeild material, 
 My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it, 
 Any place I visit I got land there, 
 How can players stand there and say I sound like them, 
 Hello, 
 Push wigs and back and push six coup's that's yellow, 
 Bust clips to expand some hand to elbow, 
 Spray up your days in, any teller you win, 
 Crack ?? to ?? is how I may be drivin', 
 ??? Of street sweepers beside the beamer wagon, 
 I rely on Bigs status, surely down if I die, 
 Put that on my diamond bezil, 
 You're messin with the Devil, 
 Why,
