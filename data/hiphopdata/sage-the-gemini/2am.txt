 Drunk off that liquor

 So you, should tell yo girls to come fuck wit us 
 Come live in the fast lane 
 Bottles every night, whatever you like 
 'Cause I do things 
 And you know my niggas keep that thing on the side 
 'Cause a nigga wanna act strange 
 But this ain't about me, girl it's all about you 
 And I ain't just runnin' games

 Full speed to my after

 Girl you know I'll be good for hours 
 You, you say it's real and I can feel on it ah 
 You know the deal, we in the moment 
 Come live in the fast lane 
 Bottles every night, whatever you like 
 'Cause I do things 
 And you know my niggas keep that thing on the side 
 'Cause a nigga wanna act strange 
 But this ain't about me, girl it's all about you 
 And I ain't just runnin' games
