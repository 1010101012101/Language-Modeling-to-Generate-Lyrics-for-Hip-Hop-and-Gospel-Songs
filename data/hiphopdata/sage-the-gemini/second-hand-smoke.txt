Oh, it's a cold world 
 Don't let yourself be corrupted! 
 Be yourself! Life's second hand smoke! 
 Huh, life's second hand smoke, thoughts of being a criminal 
 Far from being a doctor, my opera is singing... 
 Around here it's just me, buddy Ricky and Cameron 
 Mean when I heard nobody is anything scared them 
 Eleven, body street call, outside of the stream, though 
 Where all the niggas sell pounds, next week riding in three lows 
 Carrying two hundred, not dollars, thousands 
 No time for restrooms, you're the size of the house is. 
 Bring a pack to big homie, sit down, let's count it 
 Odd in here, go by something for your housing 
 No spin it up, live it up, somebody rob you, just give it up 
 Don't be selfish, appoint your niggas 
 Find something to split it up! 
 Ain't even got to smoke to get faded 
 You ain't gotta drink to say you made it 
 Oh na na, second hand smoke 
 No I don't want no second hand smoke! 
 I ain't worried about you, I'mma do what I like 
 My niggas keep it real, we ain't living the life 
 Ain't thinking with the second hand smoke 
 Ain't no time for the second hand smoke 
 Yeah, yeah, life's a second hand smoke, thoughts of being a criminal 
 Money needs, I should find a few girls and start pimping them. 
 How should I ask, when I do it they handle it, 
 Never mind, I go to... like pimping and pondering, uh! 
 And I can't do it to ... it's record deals 
 I made it here in A team and Mr. Record Still 
 Follow up, the real hits me bottled up! 
 Used to snick soda and make dollar cups 
 And still never got enough, huh! 
 Ain't even got to smoke to get faded 
 You ain't gotta drink to say you made it 
 Oh na na, second hand smoke 
 No I don't want no second hand smoke! 
 I ain't worried about you, I'mma do what I like 
 My niggas keep it real, we ain't living the life 
 Ain't thinking with the second hand smoke 
 Ain't no time for the second hand smoke 
 Ain't even got to smoke to get faded 
 You ain't gotta drink to say you made it 
 Oh na na, second hand smoke 
 No I don't want no second hand smoke! 
 I ain't worried about you, I'mma do what I like 
 My niggas keep it real, we ain't living the life 
 Ain't thinking with the second hand smoke 
 Ain't no time for the second hand smoke
