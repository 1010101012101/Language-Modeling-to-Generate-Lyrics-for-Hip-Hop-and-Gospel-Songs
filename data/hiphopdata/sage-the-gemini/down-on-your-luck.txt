I walk in this bitch looking just like a bag of money 
 I be speaking, the girls be screaming they fiending for me 
 But really it just be my money 
 Uh, pull up, I'll be dressing, y'all be stressing 
 'Cause you know that I'm the bomb, armageddon 
 Watch me, girl! 
 See, I don't want your bitch, boy, she got mileage 
 She choke more than a cinnamon challenge 
 And oh you never see me 'round here 
 And all too much money to count it 
 They like ooh you know your stuff 
 Baby, that's what's up 
 Got a girl in Virginia that look better than all your spouses 
 They like ooh you know your stuff 
 Baby, that's what's up 
 Got a girl in Virginia that look better than all your spouses 
 Down on your luck, down on your luck, down on your luck, down 
 Down on your luck, down on your luck, down, oh 
 I'm up this bitch, I got money to burn so she stacking her tits 
 Till I look in her face, and I put it away 
 I ain't throwing this money around 
 She think she's so bad 
 She don't know I had plenty bitches bad 
 Some of them quarters but know that I keep a few dimes around 
 Girl, keep popping, keep popping 
 Don't stop till the money, ain't dropping 
 Body bangin' but yo face trash 
 I'm fucked up and I got cash 
 Your luck passed and you need that 
 I'm a real nigga, I see that 
 Down on your luck, down on your luck, down on your luck, down 
 Down on your luck, down on your luck, down, oh
