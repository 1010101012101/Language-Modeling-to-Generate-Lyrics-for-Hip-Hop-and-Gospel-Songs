I'm putting on my dancing shoes tonight 
 Ten thousand people waiting for me 
 I can hear them outside 
 From the curtain I sit behind 
 The drums kick in and the lights go down 
 My heartbeat drowns out the sound 
 My hands go up, I sing my song 
 And a thousand voices sing along 
 I used to lay awake 
 Hear a crowd roar to every word I say 
 Now the stars, they used to shine so bright 
 They were all replaced by candle lights 
 And it grow, whoa 
 Makes it harder to find the places that we know 
 I'm putting on my dancing shoes tonight 
 Ten thousand people waiting for me 
 I can hear them outside 
 From the curtain I sit behind 
 The drums kick in and the lights go down 
 My heartbeat drowns out the sound 
 My hands go up, I sing my song 
 And a thousand voices sing along 
 Can you hear? Close your eyes 
 Hearts are racing side-by-side 
 For you I sing, I sing for you 
 For you, I wear these dancing shoes 
 I wear these dancing shoes 
 Are you out there? Can you hear me? 
 Are you out there? Can you hear me? 
 Are you out there? Can you hear me? 
 Are you out there? Can you hear me? 
 I'm putting on my dancing shoes tonight 
 Ten thousand people waiting for me 
 I can hear them outside 
 Can you hear? Close your eyes 
 Hearts are racing side-by-side 
 For you I sing, I sing for you 
 For you, I wear these dancing shoes 
 I wear these dancing shoes 
 I wear these dancing shoes
