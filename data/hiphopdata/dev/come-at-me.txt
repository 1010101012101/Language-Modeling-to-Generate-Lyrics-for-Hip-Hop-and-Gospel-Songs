How many numbers you got on that phone? 
 How many girls you gonna use that line on? 
 How many hearts you breaking on the regular? 
 [?], what's up with that? 
 Yeah, lover, you has gone way too far 
 How many times you gonna talk about your car 
 And the icing on the cake is that you pretend 
 You got no girlfriend, she at home again 
 'Cause when you la, l-l-la, l-l-lock and load 
 I'm like, yo, that is not how you float the boat 
 I'm like, no, no, you don't know, know 
 There's a lot, l-l-lot, l-lot more to me 
 And there's a lot more sharks swimming in the sea 
 I'm like, no, no, you don't know, know 
 So if you wanna come at me 
 Smile down like a melody 
 No matter how far you go 
 Boy, the answer is no 
 If you wanna come at me 
 Don't hit hard like an enemy 
 No matter how far you go 
 Boy, the answer is no 
 How do you think that you could have your way 
 What made you think that I would be your baby 
 Making me laugh, you think you're so incredible 
 [?], you're an animal 
 Nobody's got the key to my house 
 Nobody's paying, I built this kingdom 
 Who do you think you are, coming like royalty? 
 Enough of flattery you're getting out of me 
 'Cause when you la, l-l-la, l-l-lock and load 
 I'm like, yo, that is not how you float the boat 
 I'm like, no, no, you don't know, know 
 There's a lot, l-l-lot, l-lot more to me 
 And there's a lot more sharks swimming in the sea 
 I'm like, no, no, you don't know, know 
 So if you wanna come at me 
 Smile down like a melody 
 No matter how far you go 
 Boy, the answer is no 
 If you wanna come at me 
 Don't hit hard like an enemy 
 No matter how far you go 
 Boy, the answer is no
