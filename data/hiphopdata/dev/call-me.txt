Color me your color, baby 
 Color me your car 
 Color me your color, darling 
 I know who you are 
 Come up off your color chart 
 I know where you're coming from 
 Call me on the line 
 Call me call me any anytime 
 Call me my love 
 You can call me any day or night 
 Call me 
 Cover me with kisses, baby 
 Cover me with love 
 Roll me in designer sheets 
 I'll never get enough 
 Emotions come I don't know why 
 Cover up love's alibi 
 Call me on the line 
 Call me call me any anytime 
 Call me oh my love 
 When you're ready we can share the wine 
 Call me 
 Anytime anyplace anywhere anyway 
 Anytime anyplace anywhere any day ay ay 
 Call me on the line 
 Call me call me any anytime 
 Call me oh my love 
 When you're ready we can share the wine
