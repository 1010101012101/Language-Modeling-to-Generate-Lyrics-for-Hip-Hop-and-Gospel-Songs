Are you gonna make me breathe? 
 Are you gonna make me breathe? 
 Are you gonna make me breathe? 
 I ain't no stripper, but you're making me wanna strip 
 Ain't no beginner, but you make me feel like it's my first trip 
 So give me back the feeling only you can bring me 
 Away from all the lights of the floor 
 Way above the ceiling this night's what you make it 
 (?) 
 We bout to spark it up-up-up 
 And if I take it way too far tonight 
 Out of control, lost in the light 
 Before everything fades to black... 
 Put your lips on me and breathe 
 Are you gonna make me breathe? 
 I'm gonna get ya, gonna gonna make you fall in love 
 Take a hold of my body, tell me what you're dreaming of 
 Give me back the feeling only you can bring me 
 Away from all the lights of the floor 
 Way above the ceiling this night's what you make it 
 (?) 
 We bout to spark it up-up-up 
 And if I take it way too far tonight 
 Out of control, lost in the light 
 Before everything fades to black... 
 Put your lips on me and breathe 
 You just gotta help me breathe 
 Are you gonna make me breathe? 
 Are you gonna make me breathe? 
 I see you standing there 
 Why are you just standing there? 
 Better come over here 
 I need you right now 
 This is the night the sun came up 
 Right here, right now 
 You just gotta help me breathe 
 Are you gonna make me breathe? 
 You just gotta help me breathe
