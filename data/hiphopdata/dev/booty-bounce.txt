DJ, DJ, DJ 
 DJ put that record on 
 That's my song, that's my shit 
 Poppin' Henney XO 
 All these hoes, on my dick 
 Bet you want to see this 
 Booty bounce 
 Bet you want to see this 
 Booty bounce 
 Bet you want to see this 
 Booty bounce

 Booty bounce 
 Bet you want to see this 
 Booty bounce 
 Bet you want to see this 
 Booty bounce 
 Bet you want to see this 
 Booty bouncy bounce b-booty bounce 
 They call me Dev 
 I ain't yo average bitch 
 I'm in the club every weekend 
 On some sav ass shit 
 And now I ain't too pretty 
 To slap a hoe 
 So all you girls actin' shitty 
 Better hit the back door 
 Where the guy, where he at 
 I think I saw him in the back 
 I think we're outnumbered, fuck it (fuck it) 
 I got a baseball bat (I got a baseball bat) 
 Where the hell am I gonna catch a man like that 
 Put his number in my hand like that 
 Ripped it up like I didn't give a fuck 
 And I didn't give him a chance like that 
 DJ put that record on 
 That's my song, that's my shit

 All these hoes, on my dick 
 Bet you want to see this 
 Booty bounce

 Ridin', in the saucy whip 
 Never give a fuck it don't cost me shit 
 I'm a gangster baby, just kidding 
 Oh. No. She. Didn't.
