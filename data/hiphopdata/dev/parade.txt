Like a damn parade 
 I see the way you look when you look at my way 
 I see the way you look when you look at my way 
 Walkin' down the street and you know what they say 
 Walkin' walkin' down the street and you know what they say 
 The boys go hi 
 And the girls go hay 
 It's like damn parade 
 The boys go hi 
 And the girls go hay 
 Every day 
 Damn I'm outta control 
 And I'm ridin' around on empty 
 But my glass is full 
 So none of y'all better temp me 
 I already been here before 
 I already did this 
 So ill have another driiink 
 Give you all a few minutes uh 
 They try to get the best of me 
 Ain't impressin me 
 Get obsessed wit me 
 But I still love em, cuff em 
 Like you welcome 
 (Oh ooh) your welcome 
 (Oh ooh) your welcome 
 I see the way you look when you look at my way 
 I see the way you look when you look at my way 
 Walkin' down the street and you know what they say 
 Walkin' walkin' down the street and you know what they say 
 Ooh I'm so cold and I can't help it 
 When I walk down the street baby its selfish 
 I'm in the biulding and I'm being so rebellious 
 The night is young, I finna be on, and everbody jealous 
 They try to get the best of me 
 Ain't impressin me 
 Get obsessed wit me 
 But I still love em, cuff em 
 Like you welcome 
 (Oh ooh) your welcome 
 (Oh ooh) your welcome 
 I see the way you look when you look at my way 
 I see the way you look when you look at my way 
 Walkin' down the street and you know what they say 
 Walkin' walkin' down the street and you know what they say 
 Where all my boys at, where are my boys?

 Where all my boys at, where are my boys? 
 Where are my girls at? dem makin' noise

 I see the way you look when you look at my way 
 I see the way you look when you look at my way 
 Walkin' down the street and you know what they say 
 Walkin' walkin' down the street and you know what they say
