I was sittin' on the beach, starin' at the night 
 Pulled out a ciggarette, and you were there with the light 
 What you tryin' to do, lookin' in my eyes 
 Pretty boy step back, you don't wanna take this fight 
 But if you wanna talk, well first you gotta listen 
 I ain't like those other girls that you been missin' 
 I knew it all along, queen of my throne 
 One of a kind, I'm in a league of my own 
 And get your hand off my hip, and kiss my lips 
 Kiss my lips, kiss me all over 
 Are you gonna take that risk, take that risk 
 'Cause we're only gettin' older 
 I said kiss my lips, kiss my lips, and do it all over 
 I know you weren't expectin' this tonight 
 But baby that's me 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (x2) 
 I feel you gettin' hot, I can see it in your face 
 Bet this is what you want, to finally get a taste 
 To savour every drop, remember every kiss 
 You'll only get one shot, and this is it 
 And I know you've been waitin', since you heard me on your radio station 
 You know the situation, so boy please... 
 Get your hand off my hip, and kiss my lips 
 Kiss my lips, kiss me all over 
 Are you gonna take that risk, take that risk 
 'Cause we're only getten' older 
 I said kiss my lips, kiss my lips, and do it all over 
 I know you weren't expectin' this tonight 
 But baby that's me 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (x4) 
 Baby that's me 
 I know what you want, you know what I need 
 Show me what I came for 
 There's only one thing you gotta do for me 
 Just promise not to stop when I say so (x2) 
 And get your hand off my hip, and kiss my lips 
 Kiss my lips, kiss me all over 
 Are you gonna take that risk, take that risk 
 'Cause we're only gettin' older 
 I said kiss my lips, kiss my lips, and do it all over 
 I know you weren't expectin' this tonight 
 But baby that's me 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey (x4)
