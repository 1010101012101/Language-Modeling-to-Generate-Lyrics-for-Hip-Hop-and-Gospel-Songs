Live fast die young, go all-in, 
 Record labels on the phone stay calling, 
 First they couldn't figure me out, 
 Funny how they all want a piece of me now and, 
 Who's hot, tell me who's really balling, 
 What's the number on the phone they dialing, 
 Never would'ov picture me now, 
 Bet you wanna take a pic with me now, 
 And ooh ever would have known, tell me who your looking at, when your all alone, 
 And ooh ever would'ov known, tell me who your looking at when your all alone... is it me, me, me, me. 
 I used to live in a little ass town, 
 Now I sell out shows, bouncing up and down, 
 Flying all around, doing my thing and, 
 Don't be mad 'cause they calling my name, 
 Stunting on these ho's, brand new frames, 
 Brand new rides with the candy paint, 
 Damn who knew I could shine so bright, 
 I want to feel this way everyday of my life, 
 And ooh ever would have known, tell me who your looking at, when your all alone, 
 And ooh ever would'ov known, tell me who your looking at when your all alone... is it me, me, me, me. 
 What you looking at? what you what you look, what you looking at? me? 
 Looking at looking at, me? wicka wicka, what you looking at what you what you looking at? 
 What ever your looking for, you ain't gotta look past me? 
 Oh you like that, oh you oh you like that, 
 Looking at me, looking at looking at me? 
 What you looking at? what you what you look, what you looking at? me? 
 Looking at looking at, me? 
 Oh you like that, oh you oh you like that, 
 Oh you like that, oh you oh you like that 
 And ooh ever would have known, tell me who your looking at, when your all alone.
