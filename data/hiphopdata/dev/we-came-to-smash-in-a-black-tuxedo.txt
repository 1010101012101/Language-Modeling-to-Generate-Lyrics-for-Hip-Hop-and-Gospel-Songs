You clap your hands, 
 You're turning heads 
 You're a jumping ship, jumping on my bed 
 You snuck into my room danced away the way the night 
 I turned off my light, I turned off my light. 
 So watch me baby 
 Follow my lead 
 They can't stop us now take what you need 
 You came to smash it all, what we got to lose 
 In the black tuxedo and shining shoes. 
 We came to smash smash 
 We came to smash 
 We came to smash smash 
 We came to smash 
 We came to smash 
 We came to smash 
 We came to smash 
 Smash 
 Ooh 
 In a black tux 
 Ooh 
 In a black tux 
 We came to smash you smash 
 We came to smash 
 In black a tux 
 We came to smash you smash 
 Ooh in the black tuxedo. 
 It's not too late, I swear it's not 
 Your friend's asleep the sky's pocodot 
 Back up your car in the parking lot 
 Let's take a ride to my vacation spot 
 The streets are full, fuck it we'll walk 
 Call my phone if you wanna talk 
 Ain't got no bars, it's dark in here 
 I only shine so I can disappear 
 We came to smash smash 
 We came to smash 
 We came to smash smash 
 We came to smash 
 We came to smash 
 We came to smash 
 We came to smash 
 We came to smash 
 We came to smash 
 Smash 
 Ooh 
 In black tux 
 Ooh 
 In black tux 
 We came to smash you smash 
 Ooh we came to smash 
 In black tux 
 We came to smash you smash 
 Ooh in the black tuxedo.
