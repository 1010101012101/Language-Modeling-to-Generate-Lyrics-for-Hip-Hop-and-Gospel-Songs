I wanna take this money get out of town 
 Buy some time we can make it some how 
 Waitin' for a dream to come around 
 You know me better than that 
 Baby I'm not down 
 I left a letter for my sister in a bottle full of booze 
 One day I'm gonna love you too 
 But for now, I'm runnin' oh 
 I'm runnin' south 
 They say you better have a way back home 
 But I know, they won't forget my name back home 
 'Cause they know I'm runnin' oh 
 I'm runnin' south 
 Can ya see it on my face 
 Small town girl never new my place 
 So I got first in line for the race 
 People tellin' me don't let your dreams go to waste 
 But what are dreams if you never sleep 
 Now my dreams are alive 
 This life is sweet 
 Drippin' in my lights 
 A piece of the pie, I think I need a slice 
 How can I be lost in the dark? 
 I thought I was walkin' on stars 
 And even if I wanted to restart 
 I can't go back home 'cause I came this far 
 So, can ya see it on my face man? 
 Are you amazed, the way I make magic in the wasteland 
 Los Angeles, California I love you bitch, let me lick you and put a stamp up 
 On ya 
 A flower blooms and then a bug eats it 
 I heard a rumor, should I feed it? 
 I got a secret, can you keep it? 
 Shh listen [listen listen...]
