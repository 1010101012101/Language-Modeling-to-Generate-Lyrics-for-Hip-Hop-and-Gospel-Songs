Everywhere I look 
 Everywhere I look I see shadows 
 Haunting over me 
 And I wonder when they'll let me be 
 Lost in my mind late at night 
 And you're who I see in my dreams 
 Deepest eyes tucked aside 
 A pain that doesn't sting 
 I know I've ran and I know I hide 
 I know I've changed, I know I lied 
 I knew I should but I couldn't see 
 Bridges burnin' in back of me 
 Ooh, help me out, holy ghost 
 I have lost the only thing I know 
 And all, all I have left are shadows 
 Everywhere I look 
 Everywhere I look I see shadows 
 Haunting over me 
 And I wonder when they'll let me be 
 I wonder as the morning news 
 I wonder when tomorrow's done 
 The words you never got to hear 
 They were just right there on the tip of my tongue 
 Sometimes I scare myself 
 By my own lies that I once bought 
 They cannot be resold 
 Sometimes I feel the hurt 
 If I was gold I'd turn to sand 
 And in the end it could not hold 
 I know I've ran and I know I hide 
 I know I've changed, I know I lied 
 I knew I should but I couldn't see 
 Bridges burnin' in back of me 
 Ooh, help me out, holy ghost 
 I have lost my way from your road 
 And all, all I have left are shadows 
 Everywhere I look 
 Everywhere I look I see shadows 
 Haunting over me 
 And I wonder when they'll let me be 
 Ooh, help me out, holy ghost 
 I have lost the only thing I know 
 And all, all I have left are shadows
