I don't know who you are 
 Or who you believe to be 
 But I, I like what I see 
 And, you don't gotta be on movie screens 
 Cause god damn boy 
 You're for me 
 And don't call me a star 
 In these old denim jeans 
 You are that thing that's setting me free 
 So, stay the night 
 Talk to me 
 Let's have a dream 
 Boy, get lost with me 
 When you need to breathe I'll make your heart beat twice as fast 
 Like a cigarette and I will be your perfect match 
 Woah-oah-oah, perfect match 
 Woah-oah-oah, perfect match 
 I wanna stay up late 
 And laugh a few all night 
 Story tell about both of our lives and 
 We can lay side by side 
 Boy, hold on for the ride 
 One night 
 You know I love your style and the taste of your bittersweet smile 
 Won't you scream with me? 
 A little nightmare and a dream with me 
 When you need to breathe I'll make your heart beat twice as fast 
 Like a cigarette and I will be your perfect match 
 Woah-oah-oah, perfect match 
 Woah-oah-oah, perfect match 
 Whispers, calling, falling 
 Don't let me 
 I have just a spark left 
 Let me up and I'll set us both free 
 So close your eyes 
 Close your eyes
