They say I gotta have a plan 
 I say if you don't burn you won't tan 
 They say I gotta watch myself 
 I had my cake and watch it melt 
 Uh, I'm gonna pack it with a rocket, I'm a cock it 
 And blow the roof off this boojie club 
 Fuck the haters, gimme some love 
 Don't be so pretentious 
 I fake gold like a dentist 
 And if I said it, then I meant it 
 He a soccer player, he headed 
 I'm going lightspeed 
 Drinking rice drink, dripping Visine 
 Bitch, cover your eyes 
 You won't find me 
 Even beside me you're behind me 
 By the time you on it I'll be off it 
 By the time you get it I'll be done with' it 
 You know that we be going lightspeed ahead 
 Everybody told me I should slow down 
 But instead all I could do was take it 
 Lightspeed out of space and there is no calculation 
 Tell me, am I out of my head? 
 Or are we really going lightspeed? 
 We are experiencing some turbulence 
 It's the Cataracs 
 If you ain't on my flight you gettin' flown over 
 Under a palm tree, that's where I'm lying 
 Like when I tell people I'm sober 
 Got a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other one 
 But I ain't never listened to none of 'em 
 It's been a crazy road running 
 And no, I ain't never stopped running 
 People talking about something 
 But I, I ain't never heard nothing 
 The sun is set and the clouds are moving 
 The sky is black and I'm used to it 
 We awake all night, who knew it? 
 I got a dark soul, you could never see through it 
 By the time you on it I'll be off it 
 By the time you get it I'll be done with' it 
 You know that we be going lightspeed ahead 
 Everybody told me I should slow down 
 But instead all I could do was take it 
 Lightspeed out of space and there is no calculation 
 Tell me, am I out of my head? 
 Or are we really going lightspeed? 
 We are experiencing some turbulence 
 It's the Cataracs 
 Are we really going lightspeed? 
 Are we really going lightspeed? 
 Are we really going lightspeed?
