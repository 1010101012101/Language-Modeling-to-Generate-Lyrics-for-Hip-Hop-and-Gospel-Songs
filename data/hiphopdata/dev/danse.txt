Tell me your secret's my weakness 
 I'm only here for the weekend 
 I already got you thinking, thinking 
 Like a wifey, husband 
 She never will be, was me 
 Trust me 
 I'll be the best thing you ever had 
 You know I'm good but I've gone bad 
 You know I shoulda but I know I can 
 Under the moon, grab my hand, hand 
 And let's dance, put you in a trance 
 Like you were my man, like we was in France 
 Let's dance, put you in a trance 
 Like you were my man, like we was in France 
 By the way I'm really 
 Tranquila, vito 
 Bonita, moves real slowly 
 Dance 
 You and me, we are together 
 Forever as one, as one 
 It's not over till it's over 
 Move your body 
 As one, as one 
 When the music starts to play 
 We can dance the night away 
 I won't let you get away tonight 
 Once your body starts to move 
 I'm gonna let go of you 
 There's just one thing left to do tonight 
 Je veux danse, Danse 
 Je veux danse, Danse 
 Je veux danse, Danse y on danse 
 Danse y on danse 
 Danse y on danse y on danse y on danse y on 
 Danse danse danse danse 
 Je veux danse avec toi 
 Je veux danse avec toi 
 I know this love will last forever 
 Us together 
 As one, as one 
 Lost here in the moment 
 Till the morning 
 As one, as one 
 When the music starts to play 
 We can dance the night away 
 I won't let you get away tonight 
 Once your body starts to move 
 I'm gonna let go of you 
 There's just one thing left to do tonight 
 Je veux danse, Danse 
 Je veux danse, Danse 
 Je veux danse, Danse y on danse 
 Danse y on danse 
 Danse y on danse y on danse y on danse y on 
 Danse danse danse danse 
 Je veux danse avec toi 
 Je veux danse avec toi 
 Danse y on danse y on danse y on danse y on 
 Danse danse danse danse 
 When the music starts to play 
 We can dance the night away 
 I won't let you get away tonight 
 Once your body starts to move 
 I'm gonna let go of you 
 There's just one thing left to do tonight 
 Je veux danse, Danse 
 Je veux danse, Danse 
 Je veux danse, Danse y on danse 
 Danse y on danse 
 Danse y on danse y on danse y on danse y on 
 Danse danse danse danse 
 Je veux danse avec toi
