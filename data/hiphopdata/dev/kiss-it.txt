Let me make it clear 
 I don't want you here 
 Feels like it's been years 
 Only been a month 
 Looking in the mirror 
 I have more beers 
 Than I've shed tears 
 I don't even drink 
 La la la la (drink) 
 La la la la (drink) 
 La la la la (drink) 
 La la la la 
 You say you wasn't even there 
 So why you gotta be right there? 
 I told you I would be right back 
 Don't like it? You can kiss my ass 
 Don't you ruin, eat of my heart 
 Knew you would break it from the start 
 I thought that we could make it last 
 Now I know that you kiss my ass 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it)

 I ain't turt, through the exit 
 Girls giving me numbers, telling me text her 
 Me and Dev we hide it in Texas 
 Starred in MTV where all these dudes get naked 
 Getting hecting, living life so reckless 
 My money tattos, play you instrument nexus 
 And give me got shout, with a 12 gate 
 Throw you an ass of Jame like 12 play, huh 
 Since you left me I'm a new man 
 You want space here's some new rim 
 All my exes are dodged, I'm like new rims 
 Raising to that money, and that new rim 
 You say you wasn't even there 
 So why you gotta be right there? 
 I told you I would be right back 
 Don't like it? You can kiss my ass 
 Don't you ruin, eat of my heart 
 Knew you would break it from the start 
 I thought that we could make it last 
 Now I know that you kiss my ass 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 Living, work out, gym 
 Couldn't fuck with him 
 He won't take a hint 
 He should give a court 
 He was more broke 
 Then he was a joke 
 I don't even smoke 
 I should be more blunt 
 La la la la (blunt) 
 La la la la (blunt) 
 La la la la (blunt) 
 La la la la 
 You say you wasn't even there 
 So why you gotta be right there? 
 I told you I would be right back 
 Don't like it? You can kiss my ass 
 Don't you ruin, eat of my heart 
 Knew you would break it from the start 
 I thought that we could make it last 
 Now I know that you kiss my ass 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it) 
 La la la la (kiss it, kiss it)
