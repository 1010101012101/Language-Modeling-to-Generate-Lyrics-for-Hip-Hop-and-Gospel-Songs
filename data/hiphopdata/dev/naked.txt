(Dev) 
 You got a girl 
 That doesn't look a thing like me 
 The girl, your mother always said it would be 
 So, you could say that, you could say that 
 I'm hopeless 
 (Enrique Iglesias) 
 But that ain't the girl 
 That ain't the girl I want you to be 
 The girl that keeps up 
 And I see in my dreams 
 So, you could say that, you could say that 
 I love her 
 (Both) 
 So I don't care what they say 
 It's our life, life, life 
 We can dance if we want 
 Make it feel all right 
 Temperature's rising 
 I feel the fire 
 Tonight, it's just me and you 
 (Dev) 
 Tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up? 
 Even with no makeup 
 I don't want to fake it 
 (Enrique Iglesias) 
 And you don't gotta doubt a second if I miss you 
 Everytime I'm with you 
 (Dev) 
 I feel naked 
 Hey! I feel naked, 
 I want it, so let me get it, 
 You say you got it, what you gon' do with it? 
 (Enrique Iglesias) 
 If I told you girl 
 Come and run away with me 
 Now will you throw it all away for me? 
 I need to know that, need to know that 
 It's not over 
 (Dev) 
 'Cause you were the boy 
 Daddy told you to stay away from me 
 But you're nothing but a fantasy 
 I need to know that, need to know that 
 You'd be strong enough to believe in us 
 (Both) 
 'Cause I don't care what they say 
 It's our life, life, life 
 We can dance if we want 
 Make it feel all right 
 Temperature's rising 
 I feel the fire 
 Tonight, it's just me and you 
 (Dev) 
 Tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up? 
 Even with no makeup 
 I don't want to fake it 
 (Enrique Iglesias) 
 And you don't gotta doubt a second if I miss you 
 Everytime I'm with you 
 (Dev) 
 I feel naked 
 Hey! I feel naked, 
 I want it, so let me get it, 
 You say you got it, what you gon' do with it? 
 (Both) 
 I don't care what they say 
 It's our life, life, life 
 We can dance if we want 
 Make it feel all right 
 Temperature's rising 
 I feel the fire 
 Tonight, it's just me and you 
 Tonight, it's just me and you 
 (Dev) 
 So tell me baby, will you be here when I wake up? 
 (Enrique Iglesias) 
 I feel naked 
 (Dev) 
 I feel naked 
 I want it, so let me get it, 
 You say you got it. 
 It's the Cataracs! 
 I feel naked, 
 I want it, so let me get it, 
 You say you got it, what you gon' do with it? 
 (Both) 
 Tonight, it's just me and you
