(Feat. Lil Duval) 
 Ain't no dick ridin', money makin' killas here 
 I'm gon keep on killin' shit until a nigga get a mil 
 Niggas talkin' down, I ain't say that "Ey, hate the South" (?) 
 Come to the underground, you see those slaves walkin' out 
 Bricks, we supplyin them, birdwatchers, eyin them 
 Haters, well we eyin them, the snitches, we retire them 
 Ain't nobody fly as him, I'm picture perfect like HD Feeling 
 Big homie, yeah, that be him 
 Niggas try to copy, would that be them 
 I swear I'm rollin' all through their ears 
 I'm so real when it come, this here 
 My fans happy that a gangsta's here 
 A real live trapper, these niggas ain't gangstas 
 They wanna be best rapper, they likely never microphone (?) 
 When a real nigga tryna get grind on 
 Nigga talk shit, gettin' clapped up 
 Get a chopper style like a audience 
 You already know you ain't hard to hit 
 Shown you fake, you outta here 
 When it come to the streets, my heart is here 
 On the stage, where you want me at? 
 Look at arenas gettin' packed 
 Security, they ain't movin back 
 Cause the cocaine, I spend that
