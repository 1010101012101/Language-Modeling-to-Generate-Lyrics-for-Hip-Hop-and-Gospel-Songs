Hey Big Kuntry you better tell em 
 I'm on it nigga 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 You know who this man 
 Yeah Me and my partner poppin' bottles throwin' money in the air 
 It's a party over here nobody care who over there 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 If you don't want no trouble better get back from me 
 I'm portrayed as a gangster gonna get that money 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 I'm on the cover of a magazine 
 I even got an album out 
 ... 
 Now I'm the one everybody wanna talk about 
 Hustle hard, ball harder, that's what I be's about 
 I trap it out pimpin', better never leave your wad around 
 I'm the type of nigga that bring the whole state of Alaska down 
 Now since I'm rappin' all these rappers wanna come around 
 And stick they hand out, but these suckas didn't know about 
 All the sudden they into me, huh, they some groupies g 
 They used to look at the chain and ask me where's T.I.P. 
 Now they realize that Big Kuntry King the man in the streets 
 Real man cocaine, yeah they finally get it g 
 Yeah Me and my partner poppin' bottles throwin' money in the air 
 It's a party over here nobody care who over there 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 If you don't want no trouble better get back from me 
 I'm portrayed as a gangster gonna get that money 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 I got ... from the eighties rapped up in rubber bands 
 Party like a rockstar but this ain't a rock band 
 Throwin' money in the club, changin up precipitation 
 If you gettin' rained on then you ain't particapatin 
 I bet that struck a nerve, that's why these niggas hatin' 
 Probably thought I never make it, but that's what they get for thinkin' 
 ... 
 ... 
 ... 
 ... 
 Yeah Me and my partner poppin' bottles throwin' money in the air 
 It's a party over here nobody care who over there 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 If you don't want no trouble better get back from me 
 I'm portrayed as a gangster gonna get that money 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right 
 Yeah That's Right, That's Right, That's Right, That's Right
