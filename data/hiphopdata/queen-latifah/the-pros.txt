(Queen Latifah) 
 I stepped into a basement party in Brooklyn 
 The brothers was looking as soon as I put a foot in 
 A female walked up to me and said "Latifah bust a line" 
 I don't think you're on the strength, show me the time 
 I said "If you really want to do this, we can do this, fine 
 Take six paces and begin to rhyme" 
 As soon as attempted to make a sound 
 I ate her up with the verb, broke her down with the noun 
 'Cause I hate it when someone challenges with me but cannot balance with me 
 I get annoyed when they can't go blow for blow 
 I get pissed when I hear the lyrics a sucker brings 
 (Daddy-O) 
 Ha ha, I was thinking the same thing 
 Well I was approached by a whole damn group of them 
 Rhyme fiends, biters, and bums 
 Took me kind of light, said they wanted to fight 
 I kinda got uptight (You didn't do what I think you did?) Yeah, right! 
 Bash! went the first, Smash! went the next one 
 He started, he started to run 
 But to his surprise, his feet must have slipped 
 'Cause I snapped that neck before the second step
