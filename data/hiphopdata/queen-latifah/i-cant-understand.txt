I can't understand... 
 (I'm going crazy, you're going crazy) in the background 
 For give me father for I have sinned 
 I've just destroyed another phony ass rapper again 
 She wasn't causing it 
 She must have been stupid as a fiend 
 He should have told her child you don't step to the queen 
 Perplexed and I'm vexed cause everywhere I go 
 People be flexin and expecting me to wanna flow 
 I don't play that the only way that I will be playin' 
 As if I pay back you wanna play back so what you sayin' 
 You don't wanna be a sister in the name of rap 
 Yet you wanna talk shit and your style is whack 
 I would have squashed it before and made the whole issue dead 
 Now I'm fed so it's off with you head 
 Now the moral of the verse is that your career is through 
 And don't be fuckin' with nobody who ain't fuckin' with you 
 If I were in your shoes, I let there be a start walkin' 
 Next time there will be no talkin' 
 I can't understand...

 A brother pushed up on me at the movies one weekend 
 He was on a quest and I wasn't ?even seekin' 
 I know though I'm black and he was a Puerto Rican 
 It made no good to me cause so we continued to speakin' 
 We hit it right off and everything was on a roll 
 Before I knew it I fell in love with his soul 
 "Aye poppy aye" was the cry as he made love to me 
 I was freaked by the way he just to do me 
 And then one day when I was washing our clothes 
 A number fell out of his pocket and her name was Rose 
 A girl's number, hmm, that struck me kinda funny 
 I lost my grip, I had to call up the honey 
 There was a chick on the side, oh no it couldn't be 
 There was a chick on the side, he's down with the OPP 
 I gave you the whole shebang just to find out 
 There's another woman hitting my thang 
 I can't understand... 
 (I'm going crazy, you're going crazy) in the background 
 Why the negative vibes and why people take bribes I don't understand it yo, 
 I don't know 
 Why the bad people and why the good people die somebody gotta tell me why, 
 I don't know 
 Why the people smoke crack and why the whites fight blacks what's the scenario, 
 I don't know 
 Why the hearts get broke and why the chumps get choke they know I ain't no joke, 
 I don't know 
 Now with the drums, to the bass, to the piano and to the horn 
 It's a crazy ass life and that's my word is born 
 I'm trying to be as logical as I possibly can 
 Before the life of me 
 You know I just can't understand 
 What's going on sometimes 
 Some situations like this come out in my rhymes 
 But Queen Latifah ain't gone just yet 
 'Cause when it's come to mastering confusion I'm a vet 
 I can't understand...
