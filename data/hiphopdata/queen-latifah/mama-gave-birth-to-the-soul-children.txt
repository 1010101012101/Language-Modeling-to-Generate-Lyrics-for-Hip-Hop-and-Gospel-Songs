(Queen Latifah) 
 Possy, Dovey! (Yes mama?) Time to get up! 
 Hello, I'm Queen Latifah, how ya doing? 
 I hope that you're with this, I hope that you're willing 
 I want to introduce you to a cut called 
 "Mama Gave Birth to the Soul Children" 
 (Dove) 
 Well here comes the goy (Goy?) 
 The truth to the goy 
 You know the one, that ate up like boy 
 Stepping with a step, keeping with a kept 
 Making an appearance with a notty-head set 
 Lunatics you lose cause the Plug 2's singing 
 Peace to the negative, nah, you make the weigh-in 
 Weigh-in, weigh-in, way out of order 
 If you know you're better, you'd better that you caught a 
 Waving mine a peace sign higher than a kite 
 If you're feeling sick, it's all right it's fever night 
 Don't do "Do see do" and dig in no potholes 
 'Cause if you do we calling in March Patrol 
 It's no different from the verbal last heard 
 Cayumbo is the ruler that's bond to the word 
 He's moving more than three feet, jocking with the knee deep 
 Dove is going to leave you with a tweet tweet tweet 
 (Posdnuos) 
 Next on the menu, we continue with the pasta 
 Dipped in chocolate, served with lotsa 
 Twizzlers and honey, yum yum yummy 
 Lyrics I'm flaunting is good for the tummy 
 Tiptoing in I proceed to the floors 
 Selling much records like a pimp mover 
 Excuse me mommy, Pos wins 
 'Cause I'm the A to the Plug W-O-N 
 Brother freak it live for this tribe 
 Now let's ride down the highway of vibes 
 Pushing that we start cause the soul says please 
 Cutting back with the raps and we don't get cheese 
 Ducks and we sit need to get ???? 
 Cause preacher is the key to the casualty 
 Polaroid flicks are back and you know 
 That the soul is moving on up like the Jeffersons
