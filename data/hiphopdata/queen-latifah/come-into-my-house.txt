Welcome into my Queendom (My Queendom), come one come all 
 When it comes to lyrics I bring them (I bring them) 
 In spring I sing, in fall I call out to 
 All the ones who had a hard day 
 I prepared a place on my dance floor 
 The time is now for you to par-tay 
 I thought it would be a good chance for you to move 
 (One nation under a groove) House music always soothes 
 So get with the flow, let's go, yo 
 Can you rock to a house groove tempo? 
 If so, then shall we let the games begin? 
 What better off position can you be in? 
 I'm on fire, the flame's too hot to douse 
 The pool is over, come into my house
