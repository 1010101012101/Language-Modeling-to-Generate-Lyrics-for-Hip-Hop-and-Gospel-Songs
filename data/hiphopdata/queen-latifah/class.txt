Whatever happened to fair dealing? 
 And pure ethics 
 And nice manners? 
 Why is it everyone now so a pain in the ass? 
 Whatever happened to class? 
 Class 
 Whatever happened to, "Please, may I?" 
 And, "Yes, thank you?" 
 And, "How charming?" 
 Now, every son of a bitch is a snake in the grass 
 Whatever happened to class? 
 Class! 
 Ah, there ain't no gentlemen 
 To open up the doors 
 There ain't no ladies now, 
 There's only pigs and whores 
 And even kids'll knock ya down 
 So's they can pass 
 Nobody's got no class! 
 Whatever happened to old values? 
 And fine morals? 
 And good breeding? 
 Now, no one even says "oops" when they're 
 Passing their gas 
 Whatever happened to class? 
 Class 
 Ah, there ain't no gentlemen 
 That's fit for any use 
 And any girl'd touch your privates 
 For a deuce 
 And even kids'll kick your shins and give you sass 
 And even kids'll kick your shins and give you sass 
 Nobody's got no class! 
 All you read about today is rape and theft 
 Jesus Christ, ain't there no decency left? 
 Nobody's got no class! 
 Every guy is a snot! 
 Every girl is a twat! 
 Holy shit 
 Holy shit 
 What a shame 
 What a shame 
 What became of class?
