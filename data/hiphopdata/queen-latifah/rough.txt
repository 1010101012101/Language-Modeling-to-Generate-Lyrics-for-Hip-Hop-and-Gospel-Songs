(Heavy D) This One goes out to the rough And Rugged muthafuckas out there 
 (Latifah) - Yes Baby 
 (Heavy D) - Strictly on the Latifah tip 
 (Latifah) Yo, This is queen Latifah in the house 
 I got my boy Heavy D, My Boy Treach and my Boy KRS-One in the house to rip some shit with me right quick 
 Treach 
 The quicker committee gettin' witty for many cause the war ain't one 
 This the city where I'm From, I'll glue ya titties to ya tongue 
 It's on like this with The Black Bleep the blip 
 Smokin' Shit with mad misfits 
 The 1 man, 1 mold, Murder 1 
 Murder gold, 1 hard headache to hold 
 Word to god It's good as Gold 
 If it Ain't rough, it ain't ashy and Brick Thick 
 And If It ain't nasty, Naughty's pissin on your picnic 
 Rough is the place, the space, knuckle which way you think 
 Here to put a fat black nose on the Black Sphnix 
 I don't shoot to get pimples order your Christmas 
 I shot ST Nick 
 There's stuff for the kids I ain't get 
 No One under 17 Admitted, So I Came 18 deep 
 You can raid but you can't fade me 
 If It ain't rough, it ain't rugged 
 And If You Can't hear it, you can't dub it. COME ON 
 If It ain't rough, I could do without it 
 If It ain't rough, Just throw it to the curb 
 If It ain't rough, He could do without it 
 If It ain't rough, It's working my nerves 
 Hook by heavy d 
 Tell me how you like it - Rough, Tell me how you need it - Rough, Tell me how you keep it - Rough, Tell me how you want it - Rough 
 Heavy d 
 Tuck Away your entire stuff, I'm comin' tough, rugged and rough, from a blunt, take puff UHHH 
 Never joke with a tech nine hard than a sex mob 
 Next time, flex when it's my time 
 I'll take a chump or a champ a clamp or a zamp so now the rolly polly holly molly 
 I'm magnificent 
 Skip to my lou, gather up your crew, Let the heavysetters Show you what a N... could really do today 
 We all know about body bags, but seems everybody brags about being tough, catch a body tag 
 Knowin' well, they just cream puffs talkin' tough 'cause they've stuff, It's a bluff, They ain't tough they ain't nothin' 
 If It ain't rough, I could do without it 
 If It ain't rough, Just kick it to the curb 
 If It ain't rough, He could do without it 
 If It ain't rough, It's working my nerves 
 If It ain't rough, Now I could do without it

 Here we go, Yo, You Know the flow, I get high and Low 
 You Know, Why you wanna flow with the pro, Oh, no no no no no no no 
 Breakin' rappers in half by the ass is my only task 
 Gold and Platinum Plaques will pass, only tlaent will last 
 I come to the party prepared to kick Ass 
 You come to the party well prepared then get scared. 
 You're through and need stitching up, You and your crew start bitching up 
 (Line sampled on "Ova Confident" By Nine) Where you gonna live around where I'm not stompin' It? I really believe you're a wee bit ova confident 
 On MTV, You wanna down rate me quick, yeah I'm a hypocrite 
 When You in my face, you in my dick 
 Consequently your lyrics go flip, get a grip, 
 You Straight on some sucka shit 
 If It ain't rough, I could do without it 
 If It ain't rough, so kick it to the curb 
 If It ain't rough, you know people could do without it 
 If It ain't rough, It's working my nerves 
 If It ain't rough, I could do without it 
 If It ain't rough, so kick it to the curb 
 If It ain't rough, you know people do without it 
 If It ain't rough, you know It's working my god damn nerves 
 Latifah 
 Here comes the queen, I'll make a woman on the track get attracted like a fiend to the beat so I rap 
 You're looking for a friend to the end, good, that me 
 But if you're looking for a Gangsta bitch, That's exactly what you're gonna see 
 Ain't no way, Ain't no say, This ain't your lucky day 
 So go pray, Now you pay 'cause I don't FUCKIN' play 
 Matter fact, I think Ice-T, he put it just right 
 "You diss me on record, see me fight" 
 Just throw up the joints and get to the point 
 And cut all the talk, the BS can walk 
 You test my skills, you get put to death 
 I'm sick of all the huff puff blow your house down BULL- 
 SHIT I heard last week 
 You get ya ass beat 
 So Watch the way you approach the Queen 
 If it ain't rough I'll send that ass to the guillotines
