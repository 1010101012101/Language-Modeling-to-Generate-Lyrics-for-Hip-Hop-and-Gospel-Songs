Uh huh, well the name is Latifah, you hear me coming through 
 The spreaker. Hit it Mark, 45 king 
 I am a bill, yes I'm only a bill when 
 It's time to ill I get ill and time to chill 
 I chill, my homeboy said this was the D.A.I.S.Y. age 
 I take it as meaning you have to get crazy paid 
 You hope I'm from your borough, because I'm thorough 
 You want me to be down with you, to be seen walking around with you 
 Go to the store and buy a brew and rock a rhyme or two 
 So you can bite it, you taste it, you like it 
 You think I'm sleeping on you? Please, don't even try it 
 The name is Latifah, the scene, it is mine 
 The 45 King keeps the beat and the time while I 
 Rock to the rhythm and keep it blowing out 
 So don't try to turn me inside out
