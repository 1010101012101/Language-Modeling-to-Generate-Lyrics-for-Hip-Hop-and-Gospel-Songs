Im calling you out tonight 
 Cause you call yourself a friend... 
 And that's what I need 
 So come and waste away the evening with me 
 But I would keep a close eye on that door 
 'Cause it's your only route for quick escape 
 'Cause I... 
 I've laid my cruel intentions on the floor 
 I know... Sometimes... I've blur... 
 The lines between poison and remedy 
 Your pressure of my needle on... 
 Your skin... I know... Sometimes... I've dance 
 The fine line between friends and enemy 
 Now do you think you'll... GO 
 Will you stay with me 
 I need to know... KNOW 
 I'm taking you down with me 
 Calling you up tonight 
 I'm wondering if you'll share the dead of night with me 
 Cause in the daylight comes reality 
 And I'm thinking that I could... 
 I hoping I can find a way to share what's ailing me 
 It's the future in its finest form... 
 And my... 
 Misery loves company 
 And I... 
 Will try to bring you down as I climb for the top 
 And I will smile... 
 As I make plans to stab you in the back 
 I know... Sometimes... I've blur... 
 The lines between poison and remedy 
 Your pressure of my needle on... 
 Your skin... I know... Sometimes... I dance 
 The fine line between friends and enemy 
 Now do you think you'll stay?
