Musics loud its drowning you out. 
 It's what the bottles filled to do. 
 You bite the curb its well. 
 But the swells are getting stronger. 
 And you can't hold on much longer. 
 Give up, Give up, Give in, Sink into me. 
 The water in your lungs, makes it hard to apologize. 
 So maybe you were wrong. And maybe I was right. 
 Maybe if I wrote this song. 
 So beautiful it could make you cry. 
 Maybe a laugh or maybe a smile. 
 Maybe a could part the sea your drowning in. 
 Maybe I could make you proud, So proud. 
 You make me out to be the monster. 
 But it doesn't have to be this way, 
 If I hear you say the words. 
 And you really mean them. 
 Now the black skies turn to blue. 
 The storm now calls for you. 
 For me, For me, For us, For us. 
 It's never easy. 
 Maybe if I wrote this song, 
 So beautiful it could make you cry. 
 Maybe a laugh or maybe a smile. 
 Maybe I could part thi sea your drowning in. 
 Maybe I could make you proud, So proud, So proud. 
 Maybe if I wrote this song, 
 So beautiful it could make you cry. 
 Maybe a laugh, Maybe a smile. 
 Maybe I could part the sea your drowning in. 
 Maybe I could make you proud, So proud.
