Eleven Eleven 
 Used to be our time when I'd hold your heart next to mine 
 But now our time is your time and his time 
 Your wish is between you 
 I'll take this time to say goodbye 
 I won't pray for you forever 
 I'll throw this clock right on the fire 
 A wish postponed till never 
 Eleven Eleven 
 A stinging reminder as you fuel the fire 
 Consume me, its time for me to burn alone 
 To burn alone 
 I'll take this time to say goodbye 
 I won't pray for you forever 
 I'll throw this clock right on the fire 
 A wish postponed till never 
 I'll take this time to say goodbye 
 I won't pray for you forever 
 I'll throw this clock right on the fire 
 A wish postponed till never 
 Never 
 Never 
 Never never never 
 Till never 
 Till never 
 Forever and ever and ever
