Lay down it's late now 
 The medicine is kicking in 
 Or could it be something else 
 You're wearing thin 
 You're wearing thin 
 Breathe in and breathe out 
 The harmonies of charred black wounds 
 Playing time with the rhthym 
 In this room I can wait too long 
 If it's time to go 
 Will you stop to tell me? 
 In this room all that's left is hope 
 Will I wait alone? 
 Will you ever tell me? 
 Slow down and fade out 
 Come tomorrow time will tell 
 Will it keep holding out? 
 I'm wearing thin 
 I'm wearing thin 
 Hands down and hands out 
 I'm holding on until you go 
 But this I ask of you 
 Don't let me wait too long 
 Don't let me wait too long 
 In this room I can wait too long 
 If it's time to go 
 Will you stop to tell me? 
 In this room all that's left is hope 
 Will I wait alone? 
 Will you ever tell me? 
 And it's so hard to see you smile 
 As you're choking on every breath 
 And you're waning 
 And I'm waiting now 
 Just don't let me wait too long 
 In this room I can wait too long 
 If it's time to go 
 Will you stop to tell me? 
 In this room all that's left is hope 
 Will I wait alone? 
 Will you ever tell me? 
 In this room I can't wait too long 
 When it's time to go 
 Will you stop to tell me? 
 In this room all that's left is hope 
 Will I wait alone?
