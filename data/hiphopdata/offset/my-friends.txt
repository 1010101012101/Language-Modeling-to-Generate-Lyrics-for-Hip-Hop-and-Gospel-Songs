Well I caught sight of what I want 
 Wish I may wish I might 
 To be us forever 
 And I have to say to you all by my side 
 This song's for you 
 I'll be there when you call 
 I will break your fall 
 'Cause I know that you'll be there right when I need 
 Take my hand understand just what it means 
 To be a friend to me 
 I won't lie but I may come one day come one night 
 Dry my tears on your shoulder 
 And mine will be there anytime that you need 
 Don't hesitate 
 I'll be there when you call 
 I will break your fall 
 'Cause I know that you'll be there right when I need 
 Take my hand understand just what it means 
 To be a friend to me 
 I will break your fall 
 I'll be there when you call 
 I will break your fall 
 'Cause I know that you'll be there right when I need 
 Take my hand understand just what it means 
 To be a friend to me
