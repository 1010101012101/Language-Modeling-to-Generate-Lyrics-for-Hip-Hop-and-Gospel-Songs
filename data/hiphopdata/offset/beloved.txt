Is it so wrong to want everything? 
 Sometimes so close I had it in my grasp. 
 But I choked, I took all you could give 
 I tried so hard to make you proud 
 Its just not my fault, Its just my time to let go 
 Things fall apart... Things fall apart 
 I guess it's my time to let go 
 I fall apart... I fall apart 
 You make things so easy 
 Why can't I ever get things right? 
 I'm a thorn stuck in your side 
 I'm bringing you down 
 I try... 
 Everywhere I seem to find... 
 My feelings in your eyes 
 As tears of love roll down your face 
 Think back... Long and hard 
 Back to the time I wasn't thinking believe to be 
 Invinsible but here we go again 
 I swear it's like me trying to rain on your parade 
 It's not my fault 
 Its just my time... To let go 
 Why can't I just... Let go 
 Why can't I ever get things right 
 I'm a thorn stuck in your side 
 I'm bringing you down 
 I try... 
 Everywhere I seem to find... 
 My feelings in your eyes 
 As tears of love roll down your face 
 Why can't I ever get things right 
 I'm a thorn stuck in your side 
 I'm bringing you down 
 I try... 
 Everywhere I seem to find... 
 My feelings in your eyes 
 As tears of love roll down your face 
 Right down your face
