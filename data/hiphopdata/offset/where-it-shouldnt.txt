Wrong side of the bed today 
 Newspapers floating my way 
 I close my eyes... Don't want to read the headlines 
 Because I've started to lose faith 
 All the colors turn to grey 
 And it seems to me that hope can't save the day 
 Cause everything is where it shouldn't 
 All the things we said we wouldn't... We did 
 Can you believe the mess were in its overwhelming 
 But you tell me everything will work out fine 
 Cause its just another line 
 Until I see the words fall flat from your lips 
 Cause everything is exactly where it shouldn't 
 And everything is exactly where it shouldn't be 
 Everything is exactly where it shouldn't 
 Is exactly where it shouldn't be 
 Wrong side of the world today 
 Its where you sleep so far away 
 So close your eyes 
 And hope the next time you will wake you'll see mine 
 Then nothing else would seem to matter 
 Even if this whole world shattered... I know... 
 Id have you here with me to pick up the pieces 
 And put them right back into place 
 Fragmatic in your grace 
 And it seems just like the first time... The last time 
 But everything is where it shouldn't 
 To leave my bed I couldn't 
 Not today... Not until I see the sun light here again 
 Everything is exactly where it shouldn't 
 Everything is exactly where it shouldn't be 
 Everything is exactly where it shouldn't 
 Is exactly where it shouldn't be 
 Everything is exactly where it shouldn't 
 Everything is exactly where it shouldn't be 
 Everything is exactly where it shouldn't 
 Is exactly where it shouldn't be 
 And you're not here to dry these tears 
 And keep it all together 
 And I'm writing you this letter 
 About foggy stormy weather 
 Cause its freezing... Its cold here 
 And I need this more than ever 
 So please... Please... Stay with me 
 Until the sun comes up again 
 Till its warmer than its ever been 
 Until the sun comes up again
