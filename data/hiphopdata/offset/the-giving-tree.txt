First first not long but cursed 
 This has just begun watch as I burn 
 Watch as I burn... Watch as I burn 
 It hurts so good as long as I can see you smile 
 Just walk a mile... Just walk a mile... 
 Just walk a mile in my shoes 
 Second curse is now on earth 
 I've seen you chase this passing earth 
 So what's inside... So what's inside 
 'Cause you've got nothing inside 
 Well neither do I... Neither do I... Neither do I 
 Except my gift to you 
 I hope its everything you wanted 
 Hope its everything you wanted 
 Is my gift to you 
 I hope its everything you wanted 
 Hope its everything you wanted 
 The third seems as a first 
 All that was bad its only worse... Its only worse 
 You're only worse... You're only worse 
 You're only half of what I am 
 Take care of you... Take care of you 
 It's my gift to you 
 I hope its everything you wanted 
 Hope its everything you wanted 
 Is my gift to you 
 I hope its everything you wanted 
 Hope its everything you wanted 
 These are my arms they give you shame 
 This is my skin it keeps you sane 
 These are my veins this is my blood 
 I give it all to you my love 
 It's my gift to you... My gift to you 
 I hope its everything you wanted 
 Hope its everything you wanted 
 Is my gift to you... My gift to you 
 I hope its everything you wanted
