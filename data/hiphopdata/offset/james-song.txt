You'll sleep so sound tonight but I won't 
 I'm tossing and turning those thoughts up in my head 
 Lack decency as they keep me from my dreams 
 And those things you said 
 And those things you did 
 Can we hope that someday maybe you might make it back again my friend? 
 It won't be long 
 Until you're back again my friend 
 It won't be long 
 Until you're on your feet again 
 It won't be long 
 And all those things you said to piss me off 
 I'm sorry that it could mean 
 It just happens that way sometimes 
 All those things you said 
 That you never did 
 Can we hope that someday maybe you might make it back again my friend? 
 It won't be long 
 Until you're back again my friend 
 It won't be long 
 Until you're on your feet again 
 It won't be long
