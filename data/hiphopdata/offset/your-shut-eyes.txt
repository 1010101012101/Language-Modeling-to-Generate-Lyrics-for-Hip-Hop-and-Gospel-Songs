Waking up to you is like a dream 
 The sun sneaks through my blinds and shines across your eyes 
 I want to take you by the hand 
 And pull you out of sleep 
 Put you in my car and take you for a ride 
 The stars I see 
 Above tonight 
 Do not compare 
 To your shut eyes 
 And all I want 
 Is to hold on 
 The sky above we're all alone 
 I hold you in my arms 
 We're not very far 
 Come crash into me 
 So close to feel 
 Close enough so you can hear my heart scream 
 We've only just begun this 
 We've only just begun this 
 We've only just begun this 
 I can see your future in your eyes 
 We've only just begun this 
 We've only just begun this 
 We've only just begun this 
 I can see your future in your eyes 
 The stars I see 
 Above tonight 
 Do not compare 
 To your shut eyes 
 And all I want 
 Is to hold on 
 To hold on
