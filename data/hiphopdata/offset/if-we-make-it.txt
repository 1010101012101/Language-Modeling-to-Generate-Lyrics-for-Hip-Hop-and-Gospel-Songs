It's all right here on the table 
 All the pieces we need 
 We just need some direction 
 And it hurts me when we fail 
 On this train meant to derail 
 And I can't fall apart this time 
 No I won't fall apart 
 If we make 
 We'll leave this all behind 
 And if we make 
 Success will look to find us 
 And everything will be okay 
 If we make it 
 If we make it 
 These three long years I gave my all 
 I climbed so high, yet learned to crawl 
 But this time is the last time 
 That my knees will hit the ground 
 If we make 
 Well leave this all behind 
 And if we make 
 Success will look to find 
 And everything will be okay 
 If we make it 
 If we make it 
 If we make it
