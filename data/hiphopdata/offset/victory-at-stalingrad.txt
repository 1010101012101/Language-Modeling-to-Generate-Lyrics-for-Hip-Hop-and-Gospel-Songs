We trip and we fall, We live and we learn 
 We've come to learn from the mistakes you've made 
 And mistakes we'll make, Every single day, 
 On a regular basis. 
 So why do we keep tripping in your footsteps? 
 Why do we keep living out your regrets? 
 'Cause I don't know. And that's all I know. 
 Is that I don't know. And that's all I know. 
 123 now Go. 
 And as were lying face down choking on your gun. 
 We sing, We sing a song for you. 
 As were lying here, Our lives become a missed 
 We sing, we sing a song for all those drowning in our way. 
 Sit back, and watch a thousand years, strangle me. 
 Your hands around my neck. 
 Why do we keep tripping in your footsteps? 
 Why do we keep living out your regrets? 
 Just as long as we get up. We will be just fine. 
 But I don't know. And that's all I know. 
 Is that I don't know. 123 now Go. 
 And as were lying face down choking on your gun. 
 We sing, we sing a song for you. 
 As were lying here, our lives become a missed 
 We sing, we sing a song for all those drowning in our way. 
 If all we are is echos. 
 Now ask if I will live forever. 
 If all we are is echos. 
 Now ask if I will live forever. 
 If all we are, If all we are, 
 If all we are, Its one thing I don't know. 
 Is that I don't know. And that's all I know. 
 123 now Go. 
 And as were lying face down choking on your gun. 
 We sing, we sing a song for you. 
 As were lying here, our lives become a missed. 
 We sing, we sing a song for all those drowning in our way. 
 There's nothing you can do. It all comes back to you. 
 We sing, we sing a song for you. 
 There's nothing you can do. It all comes back to you. 
 We sing, we sing a song for all those drowning in our way.
