 Give me a red dirt road and I'll be doin' all right 
 Sittin' down by the river bottle of Grits mill 
 Double fistin evan williams steady climbn heavy hill 
 This is what it's all about I couldin ask for nothin' betta

 Rusty cars in the yard 
 Bitches booze and tittie bars

 Rollin' wood

 180 proof to wash it down and that's all she Wrote and if it kills me bury me in red clay and 
 Let it all be catered by the Ol' Country Buffet 
 Pass the whiskey bottle and drink it like your Full grown and let them bitches dance naked on 
 My tombstone
