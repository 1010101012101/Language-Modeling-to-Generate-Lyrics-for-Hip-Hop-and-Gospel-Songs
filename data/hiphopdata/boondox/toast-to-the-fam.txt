I'm tore up from the mothafukcin' floor up 
 Golden grain to the brain 
 Not really given no fuck 
 A sloppy truck bed 
 Huggin' ery' damn body 
 Half a fifth of jack 
 I'm bout' to get this bitch buck rowdy 
 A juggalo scarecrow with a big bong 
 Chuggin' southern comfort in my drawers 
 Playin' beer pong 
 Hit the bar for a couple shots of 3 V 
 Put ya bottle in the air and toast to the family 
 Everybody c'mon we gon sing a song 
 I'll grab a bottle you grab a bong, we gon 
 Get lit till the sun come up 
 And imma toast to the fam with a dixie cup (all right) 
 All I know is in this bitch 
 Let's get it on and poppin' 
 Y'all molest no regrets 
 Lets see them panties droppin' 
 And it don't matter if you smoke or if you drink 
 If you pour a little water, fire up a little dank 
 Roll a blunt light it up 
 And imma pour a glass 
 You get high and I get drunk 
 And then I meet yo' ass 
 Somewhere in the middle somewhere on the other side 
 From east coast to west everybody gettin' country fried 
 I'm drunk, you high, come on, we'll fly 
 Somewhere, down there, down south 
 And we won't have a damn care 
 Everybody c'mon we gon sing a song 
 I'll grab a bottle you grab a bong, we gon 
 Get lit till the sun come up 
 And imma toast to the fam with a dixie cup (all right) 
 I'm home so take me drunk again 
 You stoned I hope this shit don't ever end 
 Me shakin' mystery in a cup with somthin' tan gray 
 (Where the fuk'd you put ma car?) 
 What'd the fuck you say?! 
 I don't know but this shit is got me all blown 
 My head is achin' like I'm smokin' on some home grown 
 I need another shot 
 And make that shit a fuckin' double 
 And pass my fam the blunt 
 I want them fuckers high as hubble 
 When juggalos up in this bitch 
 We drink and smoke all night 
 We gettin' tore down 
 And swing our fuckin' hatchets high 
 Everybody c'mon we gon sing a song 
 I'll grab a bottle you grab a bong, we gon 
 Get lit till the sun come up 
 And imma toast to the fam with a dixie cup (all right)
