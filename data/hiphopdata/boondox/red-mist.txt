 I got 'em in my sight 
 Aimin' right between his eyes 
 Fiending for the sight of blood 
 Squirting when the bullets fly 
 Decapatatin' muthafucker with that heavy ammo 
 Posted up on rooftop dressed in black latetes and camo 
 A crazy insane sniper with an appitite 
 For that crimson tirents arteries or introduce the light 
 And no, I cannot cope' unless I see it in my scope 
 Fallen to your knees and that red mist leaves ur throat 
 (Blaze) 
 I'm like a 22 shot to your head at close range 
 The slug recoshades until it splatters ur brains 
 And no matter where it enters the exits never the same 
 Let 6 shots go, the red mist pourin' like rain 
 So much are so squeemish they can't stand the sight of blood 
 And so they passin' out when they see me in the hood 
 My wounds still bleed like imma stigmatic 
 Red mist in my trail some blood still shootin' out my jacket 
 Blood is like a river on the side of the mountain (fuck) 
 A beautiful spectical (fuck) 
 (Iiiimmmmmmmmmm excited) 
 I'm excited for the (red mist) 
 Tha' (red mist) 
 Let me see the (red mist) 
 (Monoxide) 
 Sideways your shit sprays in driveways like soundwaves 
 Creating a buzz with a 12-gauge 
 On highways it ain't safe to drive 
 I keep the window rolled down incase I gotta get live 
 And I brought Madrox with me 
 Pass me the axe 
 So I can throw it through his windshield and split his ass in half 
 A little closer so I can check out the spray 
 And let his blood tip my window while I'm driving away 
 (Madrox) 
 Who ya? I'm like a cowboy 
 6 shooter in my hand 
 Lick shots, reload, and do it again 
 Red mist 
 Splattered on my forearm and fist 
 When you shooting this close it hard to miss 
 At a distance I can see the expression of victims 
 Red liquid limpin with holes in him ya spillin somethin' 
 Retgous red sand on the cemet again 
 Till Monoxide chop you with the axe and then you finished 
 There are various patterns (fuck) 
 To the blood splatter 
 Although none really matter (fuck) 
 (Iiiimmmmmmmmmm excited) 
 I'm excited for the (red mist) 
 Tha' (red mist) 
 Let me see the (red mist) 
 The afterlife is over without blood mist 
 Only cause it matters applies to a fritz 
 (Iiiimmmmmmmmmm excited) 
 I'm excited for the (red mist) 
 Tha' (red mist) 
 Let me see the (red mist) 
 (Fuck) 
 (Boondox) 
 I keep that hatchet swingin' 
 At yo fuckin' chest I'm aimin' 
 Want to see your heart explodin' 
 Like a fuckin' hand grenade and 
 I want to see your body drain until ur life expires 
 Spittin' like a volcano spewin black ash and fire 
 With Blaze and Twiztid leave these bitches let me testify 
 Line 'em up, Sort 'em out, Who wanna b the next to die? 
 I'm quick to make you dead 
 A gyser spraying out yo' head 
 Lookin' like a faitful body twitchin' in a pool of red 
 Warm blood spray (fuck) 
 Red mist 
 Gently flowin' in the creek (fuck) 
 (Iiiimmmmmmmmmm excited) 
 I'm excited for the (red mist) 
 Tha' (red mist)
