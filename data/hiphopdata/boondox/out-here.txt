(Out here) 
 Out here where the sun don't shine 
 We 'bout that hardcore liquor and that muskadine wine 
 (Out here) 
 It's a fight even to survive 
 You a lucky motherfucker if you make it out alive 
 (Out here) 
 All night wolves howl at the moon 
 Bodies' down floatin' up down by the lagoon 
 (Out here) 
 Out here you might get bitch slapped by a black bear 
 And drug through the woods by your gnatted up hair 
 (Out here) 
 We have darker nights 
 (Out here) 
 We like starting fights 
 (Out here) 
 Know as the weed grows we risin' (2x) 
 (Out here) 
 Clear roads and passage ways 
 (Out here) 
 Swamp fields and massive graves 
 (Out here) 
 Know as the weed grows we risin' (2x) 
 (Out here) 
 Out here you might get your thoat slit 
 By a crazy ass hillbilly drunk on a 5th 
 (Out here) 
 You might wind up skin to the bone 
 Butt-naked in the dirt and your miles from home 
 (Out here) 
 Don't go walking too deep in the sticks 
 Some folks got a strange way of gettin' they kicks 
 (Out here) 
 They get crazy and dance by a fire 
 To a demon playing banjo along with hells fire 
 (Out here) 
 Out here they cookin' possum and hog nuts 
 That's mountain oysters too all y'all who don't know what's up 
 (Out here) 
 Out here they all about that country lifestyle 
 Shootin' shotguns, getting fucked up, and buck-wild 
 (Out here) 
 Out here even children don't confront us 
 That double barrel sure to send that ass into a coma 
 (Out here) 
 Out here country folks don't play 
 Chop your fucking head up and wont hesitate 
 Out here 
 Know as the weed grows we risin' (8x)
