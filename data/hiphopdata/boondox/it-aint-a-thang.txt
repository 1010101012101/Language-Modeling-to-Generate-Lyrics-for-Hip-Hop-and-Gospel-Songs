Now tell me this 
 What you fucking with the lames for girl? 
 Scoop you up out the night and take you to my world 
 Shotgun shells, Beer cans, and straw 
 In the heavy chevy swear body put to the floor 
 Were matching hard down the dirt road dirty and bald 
 Eyeballs fire-red, hot breath ice-cold 
 You with a killer from the cold if you ain't been told 
 Holdin' hands with the dead and we'll never grow old 
 I don't intend to harm u 
 Walk into the barn 
 You can sit on my face 
 'Cause I wouldn't mind the taste 
 I don't know about them fellas that you callin yo' friends 
 Might have to stick 'em in the face with a pitchfork end 
 We can walk along in the dark on Butler Bridge 
 Have your pussy hole spittin' out 15 kids 
 Bitch I was raised by the crows 
 And I've chosen you 
 So milk this muthafuckin dickhole bitch is what you do 
 It ain't a thang girl 
 They must've not have told ya 
 I can take you to the underground of Georgia 
 It ain't a thang girl 
 They must've not have told ya 
 We can fly together girl 
 And find a better world 
 The SkareCrow is watching u 
 I know ya heard the story 
 I know you see my head turning 
 Bitch don't ignore me 
 You in the boons 
 And we the only food for miles 
 Whatcha' pretty self doing out here all alone out here wilin' 
 Girl you lookin' for the killer of the cotton fields 
 I walked through death and back you wonder how that fucking feels 
 Girl I recon that you wanna do the dance 
 Take my dick out my pants I'm giving you the chance 
 The sherrif ain't come out here in many moons 
 Nothing but the crickets and the scream of the loons 
 You can be the one ridin' shotgun in the pick up 
 Getting shot in the neck with me during the stick up 
 We can fly together girl 
 And find a better world 
 I'm here to show you what the fuck is going on baby 
 We can fly together girl 
 And find a better world 
 Girl if you the shit I know you coming along baby 
 And I'm going down south with ya 
 Girl we headed down south 
 And I'm going down south with ya 
 Yeah we headed down south 
 (Chorus: till end)
