Nobody move I got the Six shooter fully loaded, 
 Finger like an automatic, bout ta let it fuckin' go, 
 And take a bunch of lives, and I ain't leavin' till I get tha door, 
 Make a wrong move and watch these shell casing hit tha floor. 
 An outlaw on tha open range, and just like Jesse James, 
 I rob these fools for change a Psychopathic Ombre with a price on my melon, 
 But takin' money from bitches and sendin they spirits to heaven. 
 I'm on an all black horse and in an all black cap, 
 My pistols layin bad luck just like an all black cat 
 And I ain't playin' with you Mutherfuckas, empty out tha drawers 
 They gone chatter outta tha safe and I'll be out tha fuckin' door. 
 Six shooter on my side, I ma ride, They ain't never takin' me alive, They never takin' me alive 
 This is a life of an Outlaw, Hustlin, Stealin, Killin' and They never gunna get caught 
 Six shooter on my side, I ma ride, They ain't never takin' me alive, They never takin' me alive 
 This is a life of an Outlaw, Hustlin, Stealin, Killin' and They never gunna get caught 
 Cold Blooded Murderra, Wanted, Fuck tha Fedi price 
 So my ass so hot they had ta file a Chapter 7 
 See my face on every corner, thought you'd bring him back alive 
 Watch the total, be tha streets, sipped him soon as I arrived 
 Time ta hit up tha Saloons, shoot tha dude behind tha bar 
 Grabbed a whole thing of Whiskey, then I lit up a cigar 
 Time for scopin now, Ho I need to get my dick sucked 
 I been ridin' all day and now some hookers gettin' fucked 
 I seen a bitch upon the stage and she was packin huge Jugs 
 Up tha stairs by hair then I beat tha pussy up 
 She started screamin like a demon, Put tha barrel in her mouth 
 Shot a load in her face and then I blew her Fuckin' brains out... 
 Six shooter on my side, I ma ride, They ain't never takin' me alive, They never takin' me alive 
 This is a life of an Outlaw, Hustlin, Stealin, Killin' and They never gunna get caught 
 Six shooter on my side, I ma ride, They ain't never takin' me alive, They never takin' me alive 
 This is a life of an Outlaw, Hustlin, Stealin, Killin' and They never gunna get caught 
 Marshalls on my ass, the lynch mob on to my trail, 
 Just one finger upon they moss, and after sendin me ta hell 
 In an old pine bow with no return stamped on tha top 
 It's gonna be a shoot em' out son, den ya hear tha shots pop 
 I can't say nuttin for tha people I killed, my name called off in a rocker hole dug in boothill 
 Dis gonna be fuckin' day 'cause I can feel it in my bones, 
 Twenty men with twenty guns about ta send my ass home 
 Pack a Winchester, and hit his soul just like a switch, 
 Barely taking many shots and I ain't dying like no bitch 
 Fully see me with precision, they won't get ta see me fall 
 Bustin' mutherfucking caps, pick 'em off screamin OUTLAW
