Monster, how should I feel? 
 Creatures lie here 
 Looking through the window 
 Monster, how should I feel? 
 Creatures lie here 
 Looking through the window 
 Monster, how should I feel? 
 Creatures lie here 
 Looking through the window 
 I'm not afraid of the dark 
 But I'm afraid of my heart 
 And I'm afraid that everything is gonna fall apart 
 Always afraid that things will never get better 
 I went from writing down rhymes 
 To typin' suicide letters 
 Diagnosed with paranoia 
 You can check my prescription 
 I'm a manic depressive 
 One of my many conditions 
 I'm not a prophet though I say it 
 But I'm seein' a vision 
 My life, it was beyond it one a one-way collision 
 If ignorance is bliss 
 Then I'm devoid of any sorrows 
 'Cause I don't wanna know the outcome 
 Of today or tomorrow 
 I just wanna hide inside my own private Hell 
 How can I ever get to Heaven 
 When so many angels fell? 
 I'm just a human being 
 I'm just only being human 
 With eternity and judgement 
 From another always loomin' 
 It's a wonder that I made it 
 With these visions in my head 
 With all these monsters at my window 
 Starin' at me in my bed 
 Monster, how should I feel? 
 Creatures lie here 
 Looking through the window 
 Monster, how should I feel? 
 Creatures lie here 
 Looking through the window 
 If you're a friend to me or kin to me 
 An enemy or into me 
 I'm begging on a bended knee 
 Come and put an end to me 
 Put me out my misery 
 Permanently, no injury 
 I'm tired of fighting entities 
 I'm running out of energy 
 Feel like a lost boy 
 Searchin' for the answers 
 Just waitin' on tragedy 
 A heart attack or even cancer 
 So many monsters hidin' 
 Waitin' 'round the corner for us 
 If life is like a song 
 I'm at the verse and searchin' for the chorus 
 Maybe I should stop and take a moment 
 Put it in perspective 
 Maybe I should take a knife 
 And take a life and get injected 
 I just wanna go out 
 On my own fuckin' terms 
 Knowing it was me that put me 
 In the dirt and with the worms 
 I think I'll pop another pill 
 Try to heal the ill 
 Wash it down with gasoline 
 Light a match and that's for real 
 But I'll just probably go to sleep 
 And try to clear my head 
 Hiding from these monsters 
 At my window, underneath my bed 
 (Muffled Singing) 
 Monster, how should I feel? 
 Creatures lie here 
 Looking through the window 
 Monster, how should I feel? 
 Creatures lie here 
 Looking through the window
