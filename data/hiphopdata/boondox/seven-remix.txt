(Children vioce) 
 A tisket, A tasket 
 The Skarecrows out his casket 
 Turn off the lights and lock the door 
 Prayin' that he passes 
 (Boondox) 
 A vision of the dead in the inbred backwoods 
 Muthafucker born inside a toolshead 
 Momma never loved me never gave me no attention 
 Daddy was a rapist 30 years up state Fulton County Prison 
 And I was raised by my own will 
 Surviving off of scraps of bones, bear traps, and road kill 
 Spending my days and my nights all alone 
 And my mind is gone, there's something wrong with my dome 
 Should have put me in a tomb I didn't ask for this life 
 When they cut me out the womb with a dull pocket knife 
 Now I walk with a sight and a murderous ability 
 A cornfed mutherfucker filled with hostility 
 Cracked out and I'm gone off that moon shine 
 100 dated of proof why I'm made from a muskadine 
 Out in these cornfields 
 Learning all these wicked skills 
 Swingin', slicing, choppin, dicing 
 Country boy born to kill 
 A demon spawn 
 The child of a bastard son 
 Seven born of seven and the 
 Seventh child fathered one 
 A soul black full of pain 
 Bodies in the field 
 Blood pourin' like rain 
 Don't get lost in the woods 
 In yo black expidition 
 On the dark dirt roads 
 So suspecious 
 Just though some ditches 
 Hedlights flicker and its got you turning switches 
 Now you so damn scarred you bout to shit in yo brentches 
 You can't think straight all you hear is heavy breathing 
 All your eyes just deceving what it is that you seeing 
 When I pull up on the ankle 
 Pristol in ther floorboard 
 Blast out ya back glass 
 Got you screamin"No No" 
 You fixing to know the reason and you about to find out 
 What it is to suffer with a rusty blade in your mouth 
 No where to run 
 No where to hide 
 Being stalked by the Skarecrow 
 The bloodline of Malaki 
 I hear these voices talkin' they won't leave me along 
 Tell me snatch this bitch up by her hair and drag her home 
 Over my shoulder in the back of a pick up truck 
 Can't wait to get her home and hold her, bleed her, then chop her up 
 (Boondox) 
 A tisket, A tasket 
 The Skarecrows out his casket 
 Turn off the lights and lock the door 
 Prayin' that he passes 
 (Children again - repeat until song over) 
 A tisket, A tasket 
 The Skarecrows out his casket 
 Turn off the lights and lock the door 
 Prayin' that he passes
