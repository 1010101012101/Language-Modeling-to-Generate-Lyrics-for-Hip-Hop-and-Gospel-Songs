In my hands I hold the key to who I wanna be 
 Solutions to my problems are just sitting right in front of me 
 I crush them up with a little bit of gun powder 
 I should be where I want to be in a half an hour 
 My mind trips I lose grip and sinkin' in 
 My eyes roll and takes control and it begins 
 Look in the mirror my relection slowing fades away 
 A monster staring back hard black and his soul decays 
 There's nothing left but a shell and an urge to kill 
 No voices in my head just the will of a couple pills 
 A contact a metal mixed with XTC 
 A knife in my hand and I know what I expect of me 
 The bloodlust in the fear is what I'm lookin' for 
 Rush in my veins as I rush and slowly bleed this whore 
 Its pure desire and it burns at me like fire 
 Mercades and a murder spree is what it takes to get me higher 
 Chorus (4x's) 
 I'm rollin' hard I'm steady rollin' (non stop) 
 When I fall nobody catch me (no) let me drop 
 Under a strobe I'm so hypnotised my pulse races 
 Look atround the room and all I see is un-familiar faces 
 Girls dancing with glow-sticks and body glitter 
 Searching for the one as the face hits and lights flicker 
 And just as quick as the sensation hit my brain 
 I saw her in the corner glowin' bright like an open flame 
 I passed her with pink hair and ponytails 
 Pale white skin with red lips just hot as hell 
 Our eyes met just like she saw right through me 
 Like she knew all my intentions but she walked up to me 
 And I ain't sweatin it 'cause I had to make her mine 
 She came up turned around so I crept up from behind 
 Put my arms around her and she reached around my neck 
 And right in the begin she knew what was next 
 She was a pro and it made me want her even more 
 Took me in the room and closed the fuckin' door 
 Chorus (4x's) 
 Slammed her against the wall I fucked this bitch in a rage 
 And with dialated pupils in my mind in a haze 
 I looked her in the eyes and I saw no fear 
 But saw the scars on her wrist and I knew why she was here 
 So I threw her on the bed and I ripped off her shirt 
 And the blood stain sheets from up under her skirt 
 I felt razor sharp pains when she dug in my skin 
 That's when I started to see the room started to spin 
 And without even thinking I put my hands on her throat 
 And she didn even blink when she started to choke 
 She just stuck her nails in so deep that I bled 
 I wanted her to die and she wanted to be dead 
 With a single breath right when I let her go 
 Her eyes fell open when her body turned cold 
 She got what she needed and I got what I came for 
 So I left her on her back like a fuckin' filthy whore 
 Chorus till end
