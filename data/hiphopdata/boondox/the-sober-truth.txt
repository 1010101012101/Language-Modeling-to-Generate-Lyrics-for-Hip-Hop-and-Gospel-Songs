Y'all thought I was done, huh? 
 Thought it was over? 
 Shit, it ain't over 
 I'm just gettin' started in this motherfucker 
 Boondox! The Scarecrow 
 And these moments I can't take 
 That I feel like I'mma break 
 When did I get so down 
 Never thought I slow down 
 Was it over? Got sober 
 Didn't know what I might do 
 Feel like heads from a prestan 
 Hit me back (I knew I was a motherfucking beast!) 
 Ain't been too long I've been sober 
 Blacked out most of my damn life 
 Bitches get fucked in bent over 
 I got shot on the next wife 
 Y'all don't know but a little bit 
 My shit ain't been closed to told 
 Always say that I'm losin' it 
 But my soul ain't been close to sold 
 Angel on my shoulder and the devil in my right hand 
 Lookin' to Jehova, empty bottle on the night stand 
 Battle with delusion calls, battle with who close to me 
 So much damn confusion didn't know who I supposed to be 
 But never no more, repeat that never no more 
 I see that comin' from a mile away and never no more 
 Don't be that same motherfucker with my head up in the cloud 
 Not just another motherfucker screamin' "hi, look at me now" 
 Still rollin' with the heater, desert eagle, that will never change 
 Quick to pull the triger now y'all fools are never outta range 
 Only thing you need to know I got to put this on my tatt 
 Dox is fucking monster resurrected, put that on the hat 
 And these moments I can't take 
 That I feel like I'mma break 
 When did I get so down 
 Never thought I slow down 
 Was it over? Got sober 
 Didn't know what I might do 
 Feel like heads from a prestan 
 Hit me back (I knew I was a motherfucking beast!) 
 Though I stand at the evident, was let me get my mind right 
 They shoulda kept me on that shit, not let me get my rhyme tight 
 19 days locked in the dark, y'all don't think I was coming back 
 Dirty now, he ain't got the heart, but here I spit on another track 
 Hoping that these bastards don't forgot how much they hate me 
 Hope they still be sleepin' on it and highly underrate me 
 Hope your girls don't flick [?] while you work on my shit 
 Hope she use your credit card and not twitch when she buy it 
 Now I got this new shit, enjoy it now and live it up 
 First that she hear this gon' be the last time that she give it up 
 On you can put that on a tall tee 
 With my number written under it so she can call me 
 Call me? A motherfucker call me lame ass 
 Long as heatens love me you can put a bullet in my brain 
 And they gon' resurrect on the third day (apparition) 
 You just feedin' fire to the flames bitch (ammunition) 
 And these moments I can't take 
 That I feel like I'mma break 
 When did I get so down 
 Never thought I slow down 
 Was it over? Got sober 
 Didn't know what I might do 
 Feel like heads from a prestan 
 Hit me back (I knew I was a motherfucking beast!) 
 And these moments I can't take 
 That I feel like I'mma break 
 When did I get so down 
 Never thought I slow down 
 Was it over? Got sober 
 Didn't know what I might do 
 Feel like heads from a prestan 
 Hit me back (I knew I was a motherfucking beast!)
