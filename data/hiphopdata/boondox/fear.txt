(Feat. Monoxide Child, Blaze) 
 Visions of my childred wiping tear from open eyes 
 As they Kneel baside my coffin family say their last goodbyes 
 But ita the faces of my babies got me trippin' thankin' god for breath 
 Expressions filled with pain has got me strappin on the vest 
 And I know that I ain't living right I hang on borrowed time 
 And this life's gome leave them bastards 'cause they pops has got to grind 
 Little mouths have got to eat so I hug them hit the streets 
 Spittin' time with them and money got me feelin' incomplete 
 And I ain't scared of any mothafucka fight the flames of hell 
 But a child without his dad has got me hiding in my shell 
 Got me shikin in my boots to see them face this world alone 
 Are the strong enough to cope stuck in half a fuckin' home 
 As I lay them down to sleep it's all on me their soul to keep 
 And if I die before I wake I pray to 
 God he's up there waitin 
 With an army full of angels strapped with gats cause 
 I'm defying 
 Since I first became o father only fear I have is dying 
 This situation has got me losting sleep 
 I can not eat 
 I'm feeling weak the fear has got me 
 On my knees 
 The fear has got me 
 This situation has got me losting sleep 
 I can not eat 
 I'm feeling weak the fear has got me 
 On my knees 
 The fear has got me 
 (Blaze) 
 After all that I have ever done 
 And all that you will ever see for life 
 Death beyond the grave 
 How will they remember me 
 I only fear the lost of my voice 
 When its gone 
 The only noise is the pen 
 I'm a writer by choice 
 I can cut my tongue clean off 
 And smoke myself toothless 
 I still be on the mic 
 Spittin' shit they call ruthless 
 The truth is 
 I go deaf dumb and blind in one ear 
 And be the dopes deaf dumb blind guy you ever hear 
 I ain't scared of dyin' 
 Death I've been there 
 The pine box for many years 
 My return ain't bull ain't no reincarnation 
 Get lost in translation 
 This situation has got me losting sleep 
 I can not eat 
 I'm feeling weak the fear has got me 
 On my knees 
 The fear has got me 
 This situation has got me losting sleep 
 I can not eat 
 I'm feeling weak the fear has got me 
 On my knees 
 The fear has got me 
 (Monoxide) 
 Eyes open but I don't remember much 
 I try to focus but the light is bright as fuck 
 I go to sit up but I'm strapped and stuck 
 Stuck panic can't say nothin' 
 Like my jaw is wired shut 
 How the fuck did get to where I am is still a mystery 
 My memories not assistin me 
 As I lay here in misery 
 Literally hopin some body would give me some kind of time 
 I'm I dead of alive 
 Is this a dream or a sign 
 Is there a chance I can find my mind and rewind 
 But paint me behind blinds and find somethin' 
 It's like a game but nobody told me we were playin' 
 And the fact that I don't know if I'm alive and sane 
 And inside my brain only one thing remains 
 The fear of no knowing paralyzes all most everthin 
 An second can be my last breath 
 And my best guess is nothin' with on memories left 
 I'm sorry 
 This situation has got me losting sleep 
 I can not eat 
 I'm feeling weak the fear has got me 
 On my knees 
 The fear has got me 
 This situation has got me losting sleep 
 I can not eat 
 I'm feeling weak the fear has got me 
 On my knees 
 The fear has got me
