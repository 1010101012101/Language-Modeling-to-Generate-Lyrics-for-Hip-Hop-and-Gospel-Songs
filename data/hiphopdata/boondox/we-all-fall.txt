See the leaves falling to the ground 
 See them falling all around 
 On the cemetery mound (x2) 
 Teardrops on my note pad 
 Dope sick feels so bad 
 Everything seems so fucked up 
 I'm about to go mad 
 My life tried to live right 
 This night hope will end right 
 Hells doors open wide 
 Inside here's your invite 
 One breath should I use it? 
 Life / death should I choose it 
 Legacy, life of me 
 Hear my voice in this music 
 Phone calls to a few peeps 
 No promises to keep 
 Close my eyes kiss the sky 
 And then just go to sleep 
 So long tried to hold on 
 So long tried to stay strong 
 Everything that I know and grow 
 Now seems long gone 
 No more hearing "I should try" 
 No more wishing I would die 
 Close my eyes, let it go 
 And leave you with "goodbye" 
 See the leaves falling to the ground 
 See them falling all around 
 On the cemetery mound 
 Everybodies gonna die someday 
 Everybodies gonna die someday 
 Die, die someday 
 One love to all those 
 That got me through the lows 
 And stood by my side 
 And they came out to my shows 
 And gave me a reason 
 To pick up this hatchet 
 And run with the family 
 Scream Psychopathic 
 I wanna thank you for all the time spent 
 You don't know how much it really meant 
 To have family show love to a scrub 
 Who came up from shit 
 I hopeyou know that I give all 
 You show me how to always stand tall 
 Brought me from the grip of death 
 So know that I love y'all 
 See the leaves falling to the ground 
 See them falling all around 
 On the cemetery mound 
 Everybodies gonna die someday 
 Everybodies gonna die someday 
 Die, die someday 
 See the leaves falling to the ground 
 See them falling all around 
 On the cemetery mound
