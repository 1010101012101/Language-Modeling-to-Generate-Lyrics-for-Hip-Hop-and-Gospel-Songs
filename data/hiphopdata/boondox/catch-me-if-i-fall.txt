 Juggalos and juggalettes it makes me proud to announce from the south of hell boondox 
 Who gon catch me when I'm falling down into darkness 
 What have I created my dreams fall apart when a demon gets 
 Discovered an angel has to suffer just leave me in my hell I will put nothing above us 
 One prick from an infernal pinch fire in my veins burning like a bitch 
 So sick till I get my fix I'm sweating in the corner with a crucifix 
 Her tears from like bastard angels fall from heavens graces this hell I'm living in this sin I'm seeing demons faces 
 The darkness takes over my senses fall into a coma mix blood and soma wash it down with some holy water dance with the devil 
 By the pale moon light with a needle for my appetite get on my level 6 feet in the dirt never see the light 
 Who gon catch me when I'm falling down into darkness 
 What have I created my dreams fall apart when a demon gets 
 Discovered an angel has to suffer just leave me in my hell I will put nothing above us 
 No rest for this wicked soul and everyone suffers when it takes control my family looking at me like I'm the demon I'm trying to 
 Hide it but they know somehow they do gotta keep moving down this vanishing path while I'm stuck in a chemical bath soaking on my own behalf 
 But I'm taking them with me as much as I try to lead them right while I go left I know their trying to help me but I gotta face this demon by myself 
 As I wonder who gave me this curse it was me and yet no other if I can't win against this demon forever my angels have to suffer 
 Who gon catch me when I'm falling down into darkness 
 What have I created my dreams fall apart when a demon gets 
 Discovered an angel has to suffer just leave me in my hell I will put nothing above us 
 On my knees and look to the sky please lord help me now its got me and I don't know how everything 
 I know is gone sitting here I'm all alone and tryin' to figure everything out 
 Who gon catch me when I'm falling down into darkness 
 What have I created my dreams fall apart when a demon gets 
 Discovered an angel has to suffer just leave me in my hell I will put nothing above us
