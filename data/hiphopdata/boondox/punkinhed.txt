You cannot even envision in the darkest cataclysms 
 Of your fucking mind as its throws you into aneurysms 
 It's got your blood clotting and your fucking veins rotting 
 The very sound of my name has got you grave plotting 
 'Cause I was brought into this wold up on a mission 
 And a voodoo ritual got my fucking ass up and kicking 
 And high stepping bout to turn this bitch red 
 Coming up out the ground just like the return of the living dead 
 I'm feigning for your brains and I'm as sick as the fever 
 Try to fuck with a monster you better leave it to beaver 
 'Cause I'm coming for your life you been marked by the beast 
 I'm going to eat your fucking soul so be prepared to be deceased 
 Close your eyes turn around 
 And say my name 
 A drop of blood on the ground 
 For every drop of pain 
 No turning back now it's done 
 Everything is said 
 I am evil 
 I am pain 
 I am the PunkinHed 
 Thirty seven years cold and resting in the pieces 
 Skin falling off the bone and maggots stuck in the creases 
 Got me feeling pissed off and on some whole other level 
 Now I'm summoned from hell to do the work of the devil 
 A crucifix in my pocket from another place and time 
 I was found but now I'm lost 
 I could see but now I'm blind 
 Blinded to the fact I'll never walk inside the light 
 Now I wait inside the darkness till I'm called out by the night 
 I'm a fucking nursery rhyme on the school playground 
 Jumping rope throwing rocks little kids play round 
 Screaming out my name pray not to wake up dead 
 Put a cross on your front door to keep away the Punkinhed 
 Cross my heart and hope to die 
 Please stick a needle in my eye 
 To keep me blinded to the sight 
 When PunkinHed appears tonight
