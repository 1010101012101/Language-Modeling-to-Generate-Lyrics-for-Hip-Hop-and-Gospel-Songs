This is a cat (meow) 
 This is a horse (whinny) 
 A cow says (moo) 
 I hear them talking to me and the demons stalkin me 
 Running in between my thoughts and dreams I think they haunting me 
 Got me sweatin got me stressin wake up in the woods with a Smith and Wesson 
 Bucked naked countin' blessins blood soaked clothes with no confessions 
 I don't know what it is that's livin' in my nightmares 
 I don't know what it is that's bringin' all these night scares 
 All I knowin' is what the fuck I got to lose 
 When everything I'm dreamin' of end up on the evenin news 
 Boondox: 
 I'm sleepin' only sleepin' I'm sleepin' only sleepin' 
 I don't wanna sleep I don't wanna dream I don't wanna hear the suffering, I don't wanna hear the screams 
 Violent J: 
 I'm only dreamin', I know I'm only dreamin' 
 Boondox: 
 I don't wanna sleep I don't wanna dream I don't wanna hear the suffering, I don't wanna hear the screams 
 Last night I dreamt that I was standin by a streetlight 
 Bloody knuckles bloody nose but was I in a street fight? 
 That's when I woke up body feeling broke up 
 Eyes glazed in a haze fucked up 'cause I'm choked up 
 It's to a point that I don't even want to fall asleep 
 Every time I close my eyes another victim at my feet 
 It's getting hard to deal and hard to reckognize the real 
 Hard to keep my sanity and hard to say just how I feel 
 And I don't want to know why this chick is barely breathing 
 Begging for her very life scratching clawing kicking screaming 
 While I just stand there laughing while this bitch's life is passing 
 Rope around her throat I watch her choke for every breath she gaspin 
 I watch her face and watch the tears pourin like rain 
 How'd I end up in this place translated in her fears and pain 
 So sick my stomach churnin in slow motion while theworld keeps turnin' 
 So sick mind of a vermin knowing that my soul is burning 
 I don't wanna sleep I can't even close my eyes 
 I don't wanna dream every night somebody dies 
 I don't wanna think what's the truth behind these lies? 
 I don't wanna hear the screams and I don't wanna hear the cries
