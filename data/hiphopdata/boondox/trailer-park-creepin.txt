(Feat. Violent J) 
 Now I'm on the run 
 On the run from it all 
 I'd rather be shot dead 
 Then locked up with the law 
 I'm runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' RUNNIN' 
 No place to hide 
 And I gotta leave my whole world behind me 
 My dog and my double wide 
 You might call me pathetic 
 You might say that I've lost my mind 
 Sittin' here in the driveway baby and clutchin on a forty-five 
 But ya did me so wrong 
 And I can't say I understand 
 Now I'm bout to blow ya brains out bitch into the arms of another man 
 I cought you creep'n 
 And now you goin' to be sleepin' with the worms in the dirt 
 What the fuck was you thinkin' 
 Do I look like the kind of mothafucker you can cheat on 
 You lookin' like a fuckin' whore I can beat on 
 But I ever touch 
 Never laid a single hand 
 Nair hair on your head 
 Never touch a single strand 
 While I sittin' here knowin' what's bout to happen 
 There goin' get me for domestic because the pistol did the slapin 
 Now I'm on the run 
 On the run from it all 
 I'd rather be shot dead 
 Then locked up with the law 
 I'm runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' RUNNIN' 
 No place to hide 
 And I gotta leave my whole world behind me 
 My dog and my double wide 
 Standin here in our bedroom 
 With your body laid on the ground 
 Two dead mothafuckas lookin' silly with they blood sprayed all around 
 And I'm sittin' here thinkin' where the fuck am I goin' to go 
 Burn the whole mothafuckin trailer to the dirt 
 And its off to Mexico 
 Adi√£s mothafuckas see you later 
 When I kicked in the door of a double wide trailer 
 And I saw your fuckin' titties steady bouncin' like Hydraulics 
 And the next door neighbor had you fold like a wallet 
 And I got to really say I was kind of impressed 
 The way your heals of your feet was drivin' into your chest 
 And I hate to interrupt while he's givin' it to you 
 The last thing you saw was his face in my boot 
 Now I'm on the run 
 On the run from it all 
 I'd rather be shot dead 
 Then locked up with the law 
 I'm runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' RUNNIN' 
 No place to hide 
 And I gotta leave my whole world behind me 
 My dog and my double wide 
 They ain't neva gonna catch me 
 I won't do a lick of time 
 I'll ve on a beach under an umbrella gettin' blow back sippin wine 
 And while your laid out burnin 
 Lookin' crispy like some KFC 
 Do a little soul searchin mothafucka cause never shoulda fucked with me 
 Now I'm on the run 
 On the run from it all 
 I'd rather be shot dead 
 Then locked up with the law 
 I'm runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' RUNNIN' 
 No place to hide 
 And I gotta leave my whole world behind me 
 My dog and my double wide 
 And I can't take nothin' 
 Nothin' at all 
 Gotta leave my bucket my toaster and my saw 
 Had a poster of Stone Cold 
 Still up on the wall 
 Had to leave town in a hurry 
 Tell the police I said 
 Fuck y'all
