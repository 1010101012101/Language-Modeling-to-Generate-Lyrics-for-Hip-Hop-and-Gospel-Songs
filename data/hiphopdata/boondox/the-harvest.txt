(AMB 2x) 
 It's the time for the harvest 
 Time of the harvest 
 It's the time of the harvest 
 Your time 
 (Bonez Dubb) 
 My ride broke down on a mountain of dust I'm lost 
 With nobody around I can't fuck with the cost 
 Of the cell phone or tow truck or even the cops 
 Nobody gonna find me until my cold heart stopps 
 (I started walkin' and all of a suddent the sky became rain) 
 Seen a house on the way looked fuckin' insane 
 With no windows or locks so I stepped inside the room 
 Anything can really happen so I'm trying to leave soon 
 (And then I seen a blade) 
 Hangin' down from the wall there's no explanation for the crazy shit I saw 
 Got me trippin' but I reached for the steel anyway 
 That's all I can say because after that day 
 They say too many peopole died at that main highway 
 I guessed I murdered them all when I'm possesed by the blade 
 So they lockin my up for life and now I'm gone 
 And the only thing on my mind is what I did wrong 
 It's the time for the harvest Time of the harvest 
 (When the sling blade works in ways that's so sticky to y'all to die die die die die die die) 
 It's the time of the harvest Your time 
 (In the chemical chills the blood spills and drippin' we all die die die die die die die) 
 (Boondox) 
 When I feel I got the urge to kill 
 As if for real I draw a blank and then I reachin' for steel 
 The sharpest razor blades that made my first rate 
 Hands of full believers full of murder and hate 
 Used by many souls, many years on the crops 
 Slicin through dicing thought wheat and corn spots 
 But when I grab it something happens that hears all of my confessions 
 Takin' control of my emotions like a demon possession 
 No remorse in my heart for the things it made me do 
 All the blood that was shead like it wasn't even true 
 Wake up in cold sweat sheets covered in red 
 Then the flashbacks hit me of all the sould that we bled 
 Was it true? Did I do all these things in my brain? 
 Was the slingblade curse or was I going insane? 
 I ran out the front door and just looked all around 
 100 headless corprses' laying all over the ground 
 (Otis) 
 Got it in my hands and a feelin' rush though 
 Ain't nobody know what to do when my slingblade fucks you 
 Cuts through with a 1, 2 
 I drop poison on my airplane when I crop dust you 
 See I gotta put food on the table 
 And give sacrifice to the Gods that I pray to 
 And that means that nothing can save you 
 Apologive to Mother Earth for what the humans bring you 
 I raise through the fields and chase you 
 With fast pace your back breaks 
 When the sight takes you 
 Then I drag you back by the hair to my shack 
 Button up my coat and diesect your throat 
 I cut out the flesh the pieces are so big 
 I put 'em through a shredder then I feed them to my pig 
 And I know the job move a little slow 
 But the heart is dissend and imma sweep what we sew 
 (Chorus till end)
