(Feat. Jamie Madrox) 
 Diiiiie 
 Giving my soul to hell, 
 And tell Heaven I did my best. 
 One love to family 
 To Juggalos 
 And fuck tha rest 
 I'm tired of all these snakes and demons leaches on the vein, 
 I've bled enough and now these bitches bout to feel tha pain. 
 You know you name the haters been and with a point of view, 
 Pussy mother fuckers talkin' shit but never had a clue. 
 Come with your attitude cocksucka fuck yo life. 
 I tie you to a chair and make you watch me fuck your wife. 
 I'm just trying to catch you slippin like a bar of soap, 
 I catch you while you sleepin' fast 
 And then I slit your throat. 
 I watch you bleed and gargle choking for your last breath, 
 Then close the wound apply some pressure to delay ya death. 
 See what it means your whole existence don't mean shit to me, 
 It ain't nothing but time to kill to make you history. 
 And all you had to do was to keep your fucking trap closed. 
 But now you got your hands folded, 
 Clutched onto a single rose. 
 (Backup singers:) 
 I'll take your life 
 But here tonight 
 You want to try, DIE! 
 (Chorus: Boondox) 
 Just close your eyes, 
 Say your last good-byes. 
 Get down on your knees, 
 Dry them eyes bitch and make your peace. 
 (Jamie Madrox:) 
 OK Jamie not a hater, 
 If I was it ain't no killin' me. 
 I live forever 
 Never die 
 Surviving off the infamy 
 Miss me with that everbody wants me dead same ol' 
 And switch my hatchet to a target hanging off my cable. 
 If you critisize my fashion you faggot like Tim Gunn, 
 I'm a Juggalo scrub, 
 It's that since day one. 
 So kill the hater, 
 Replicator, 
 Dissin with a foul tongue. 
 Take my magic marker and blacken his fuckin' left lung, 
 With my box-cutter I'm a cut his eyes wide 
 And with broken pieces of mirror replacin both his eyes. 
 Got a demon inside that's been along for the ride, 
 Since the release of my first LP back in 95. 
 Ever since that day 
 I've been embracin the hate 
 And basically not givin' a fuck 
 Wut none of y'all say. 
 So fuck y'all bitches 
 Black flowers up on your casket 
 You get what you deserve 
 Burn in hell hatein bastards 
 (Backup singers:) 
 I'll take your life 
 But here tonight 
 You want to try, DIE! 
 (Chorus: Boondox) 
 Just close your eyes, 
 Say your last good-byes. 
 Get down on your knees, 
 Dry them eyes bitch and make your peace. 
 (Boondox:) 
 I see the shit ya pullin 
 Lookin' like a trailer hitch, 
 Come to your hood with goons 
 And snatch you out your trailer bitch. 
 Put on your knees and close your eyes 
 Wait for the execution. 
 Some call this first degree 
 But I call it my retribution. 
 Ya had your chance to keep the sun 
 And now you're in the rain, 
 I be the Skarcrow but you the one who missin' brains. 
 I put the barrel to the bone 
 And now your so fucked 
 Two times eleven to yadome now ya outta luck. 
 So many times I spit just dwellin thinking of the day 
 Up to the point I sit for hours thinkin' of away 
 To make you suffer 
 Make ya blood spill like the wine. 
 Six feet up underneath the ground 
 Have ya smellin tha pine. 
 Lost in the woods till you discovered by a boy scout 
 Stupid mother fucker what was you thinking 
 Now ya body in the bushes 
 Like this rottin of the stinkin 
 (DIE CHANT w/) 
 (Backup singers:) 
 I'll take your life 
 But here tonight 
 You want to try, DIE! 
 (Chorus: Boondox) 
 Just close your eyes, 
 Say your last good-byes. 
 Get down on your knees, 
 Dry them eyes bitch and make your peace.
