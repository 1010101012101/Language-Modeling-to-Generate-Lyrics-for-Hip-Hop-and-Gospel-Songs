(A tiskit a taskit 
 The scarecrows out his casket 
 Turn out the lites and lock the doors 
 Prayin' that he passes) 
 A vision of the dead and the inbread of the backwoods 
 Muthafucka born inside a tool shed 
 Momma never loved me never paid me no attention 
 Daddy was a rapist 30 years upstate in Fulton County Prison 
 And I was raised by my own will 
 Survivin offa scraps and bones 
 Bear traps and road kill 
 Spendin my days and my nites all alone 
 N my mind is gone there sumthin wrong wit my dome 
 They shoulda put me in that tomb 
 I didn't ask for this life 
 When they cut me out the womb with a dull pocket knife 
 Now I walk with a scythe 
 And a murderous ability 
 A corn-fed muthafucka filled with hostility 
 Cracked out and I'm gone off the moonshine 
 A hundred eighty proof wine made from that muska dyin' 
 Out in these corn fields learnin all these wicked skills 
 Swingin' slicin choppin dicin 
 Country boy born to kill 
 A demon spawn, the child of a bastard son 
 Seven born to seven and the seventh child fathered one 
 A soul black, full of pain 
 Bodies in the field, blood pourin like rain 
 Don't get lost in the woods in your black expedition 
 On a dark dirt road so suspicious just trees and ditches 
 Headlights flicker and it's got you turnin' switches 
 Now you so damn scared you bout to shit in your britches 
 You can't think straight all you hear is heavy breathin 
 Are your eyes just deceivin wut it is that you seein 
 When I pull up the eight four pistol in the floorboard 
 Blast out your back glass got you screamin oh no 
 You finna know the reason and you bout to find out 
 Wut it is to suffer with a rusted blade in your mouth 
 Nowhere to run nowhere to hide 
 Bein stalked by the scarecrow the blood line of Malakai 
 I hear these voices talkin' they won't leave me alone 
 Tell me snatch up this bitch by her hair and drag her home 
 Over my shoulder in the back of a pickup truck 
 Can't wait to get her home and hold her bleed her then chop her up 
 (A tiskit a taskit 
 The scarecrows out his casket 
 Turn out the lites and lock the doors 
 Prayin' that he passes)
