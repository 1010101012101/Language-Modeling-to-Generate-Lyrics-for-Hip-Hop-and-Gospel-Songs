Fall asleep dreamin' red is what I see anymore 
 And I do not fear of death because I seen 'em before 
 My eyes are closed to open wide to see it never change 
 Only the players in the game, but all the rest stay the same 
 Is this reality I'm livin' in or pinnace for pricing 
 I'm feelin' sorry for myself, please take out the violin 
 And playin' symphony to soundtrack of a lunatic 
 I mighta illuminated or finally losin' it 
 I walk a thin line between myself and somebody else 
 And I cannot decipher between I'm living in fuckin' hell 
 Or dying on earth, my whole world is a crying shame 
 Nothing is what it seems it's like some shit outta crying game 
 I'm sickening, inflicted in feeling somewhat redicted by 
 Pull a bullet in my brain, but even that seems conflicted 
 Where would I end up or it just start all over 
 Give me the horns of Lucifer or the wings of Jehova 
 All this violence in your head seem 
 Flowing through your veins like a symphony 
 And it's a psychopathic melody 
 Sit in silence still your head scream 
 Playing through your veins like a symphony 
 And it's a psychopathic melody 
 It's a psychopathic melody 
 It's a psychopathic melody 
 Is my reality infringement on my imagination 
 Everything that I see, somehow it's all my creation 
 Or am I just as disturbed some fuck locked in the padded cell 
 Drugged out on anti psychotics, livin' in hell 
 Can't remember my birth, no recolection of death 
 And where did it all go away? No longer taking a breath 
 And where did it all go away? If I started blastin' at bastards 
 Startin' killing everybody, I'm a virus or cancer? 
 Many reasons for bleeding the reason families are grieving 
 The reason for seasons like I'm a reason for heathens 
 Or am I just a human being who is only being human 
 With more questions and answers like what the hell am I doing? 
 Why do I'm still obsessed with this shit just fill me with [?] 
 Let me drew in the corner, just shoot me up fully dopamine 
 I just wanna drift away I call my daily departed 
 But with melodic sounds this whole situation got started 
 All this violence in your head seem 
 Flowing through your veins like a symphony 
 And it's a psychopathic melody 
 Sit in silence still your head scream 
 Playing through your veins like a symphony 
 And it's a psychopathic melody 
 It's a psychopathic melody 
 It's a psychopathic melody 
 This won't go away until your dying day 
 You will suffer in your own way (your own way) 
 And in the end there will be hell to pay (hell to pay) 
 At the gates they say "go away, go away, go away..." 
 All this violence in your head seem 
 Flowing through your veins like a symphony 
 And it's a psychopathic melody 
 Sit in silence still your head scream 
 Playing through your veins like a symphony 
 And it's a psychopathic melody 
 It's a psychopathic melody 
 It's a psychopathic melody
