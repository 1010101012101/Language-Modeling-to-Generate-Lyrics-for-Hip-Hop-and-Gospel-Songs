I don't need brakes because there's no stopin me 
 Most niggaz get broke down properly 
 I'm locced out, smoked, coccing heat 
 Running from the cops like I got roccet feet 
 Fucc gloves when you box wit me 
 We can fight to the death like pitbull dawggs 
 Running out of breath trying to make a mess wit my vest nigga I'm a give it my all 
 I refuse to lose cuzz I'm givin' these niggaz the bluez becuzz they can't handle me they want me to wear sandles instead of shoes 
 But I got bad news t-nutty don't gave a fucc I'm coming to blast you just for thinkin' they thuged out with a ragg and some tattoos 
 Watch me go for mine young t-nutty tokin nines don't need a buddy when I'm on the grind 
 Becuzz I'm a cuttthroat and a locc that's known for crime known for rymes known to flip at a drop of a dime and move nice a kicc it were crip homies shoot dice 
 Chasin that cheddar like a loose mice 'cause I'm a money hunger little homie fucc all you fonie niggaz 
 See me by my lonely nigga I'm a ride and still staccin some mo cheese 
 I know so niggaz that's ogs and let them lace my tennie shoes 
 I be giving these niggaz the bluez off that chulupa we acting like foolz...
