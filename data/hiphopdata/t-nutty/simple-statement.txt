Ladies and Gentlemen 
 Introducing 
 T-Nutty 
 Oh my goodness 
 T-Nutty is heated 
 He can't be defeated 
 I can not believe this 
 See nigga I'm heated like that 
 Heater talking like walking thermostat 
 Imma make a simple statement 
 Here's the latest sense you waited 
 Congradulations you found the greatest 
 Dropping shit like I'm constipated 
 Consentrated on stacking my mail 
 The Populations got it cracking with sales 
 For my occupation I'm high with patients 
 If I'm not mistaken I'm leaving a trail 
 Following me now like All of me pals 
 If you refuse to do the opposite 
 Niggaz gonna hop in a gown 
 I'm lockin it down 
 On the westcoast ain't no stopping it 
 With the best flows got bitches jockin it 
 At the next show 'cause I be rocking it 
 Ima the best Loc it's my prorogitive 
 If I'm strapped with a glock and I'm cocking it 
 And ya not convienced I'm bout to get the victim 
 This is whatcha wanted 
 Y'all don't want it 
 Swallowing opponents 
 'Cause I'm a get on it 
 Just give me a moment 
 I'm loaded off the gonja 
 Rolled up alota 
 Holding my dollars 
 Smashing the bucket 
 Hollering like fuck it 
 Ill dump atcha baby mama 
 'Cause I'm West Walking 
 All that stress talking to a vet 
 Every so often is causing a mess 
 So I suggest you get loss when a boss flowss his steps 
 I doubt that you want to go toes with a bouncer 
 Ima pull a stick up like Alphapha 
 Hop with the pick up and get something out cha 
 Spitting like a public announcer 
 Fill up a nigga with fillable killables 
 Rittles and shit like cibbles and bits 
 Your edible nigga my styles incredible 
 Let 'em know there ain't no fuckin' with this 
 Seen out of luck you son of a bitch 
 Who gives a fuck about a rap that you write 
 If your under attack you'll be wondering 
 T-Nutty Nut man who the fuck is this? (who the fuck is this) 
 That nigga that's here to keep it on the map 
 Hit 'em so hard that there sleeping on their back 
 My lil niggaz creeping up with gats 
 Its time to ride with the Nutty Factor 
 Besides, none of them other guys wanna fuck with me 
 Under no circumstances ask them bastards is T-Nutty a G 
 That piggity pack that higgity humpty dumpty 
 Beat a nigga that think he can punk me 
 I'm from the planet of the mad gorillas and monkeys 
 That adapt to living with the Factorism 
 Get to slapping cats with the ism 
 Just like a pitbill dog when we sick em 
 Quick when I creep through the fog when I lick em 
 Oh my goodness 
 You niggaz can't see me I'm hungry and greedy tryna get meaty 
 Oh my goodness 
 I'm one of the needy state to state with the Nutty graffiti 
 Oh my goodness 
 Could this be the good shit to hit cha hood with 
 And in that ass is where my foot slip 
 I just wish I had the camera footage 
 Some niggaz is crooked as soon as you look at 'em you can tell 
 I'm judging books by the cover don't even opening up the bad mail 
 Tired as hell mob and bail 
 All through the back streets after the mail 
 Half of these niggaz wanna follow my trail 
 Moving like a snail and light on the scale 
 I'm little but I'm not frail 
 Got niggaz ducking and tucking they tails 
 We even got niggaz to clean up the shells 
 Ride with the Factor no one tells 
 If the shit smells then plug your nose 
 And point fingers at the 4's 
 Indecent exposure explosive shit can't be exposed 
 So all you niggaz and hoes I'm giving thanks for your attention 
 Its Young T-Nutty Nut with that shit that I had to mentiion 
 -We Love you 
 We love you T-Nutty
