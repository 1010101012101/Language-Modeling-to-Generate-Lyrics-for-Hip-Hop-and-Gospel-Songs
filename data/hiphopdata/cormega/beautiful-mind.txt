I'm sick of gossipping bithces and niggaz who gossip like bitches 
 Claimin' they live but if you pop 'em they snitchin' 
 Some watch from the building and gain knowledge of dealers 
 Knowin' they lack the heart of those that's out on the benches 
 I was out in the trenches-which enables me 
 To write such a powerful picture like Apocolypse Now 
 I put my heart in my lyrics every time I sit down to write 
 My swords an inspiration, ain't three and a half mics 
 I must have been an MC in my past life 
 Presently I'm unquestionably poetic, I'm mad nice 
 People act like I don't deserve nothing I got 
 I grew up in the spot, my sleep was interrupted by customers knocks 
 Some of y'all should just stop the anomosity you got for me like it was not 
 For years we ran a marathon, its catostrophic 
 Our time, death, and pride came out on conquest 
 Subsequently some are with me others ain't yet the gun is within mr 
 I wish for nothing except that my mother was with me 
 Some place judgement against me based on nothing but envy 
 They pray for My Downfall like the song by Biggie 
 Born in the city which never sleeps to rest the piece 
 Its carved in stone, some starved while others bled to eat 
 Rap is my legacy, I leave my seed my destiny 
 Accept her, hope she never see the jealousy success can bring 
 The trife life and death of kings 
 I'm from the rarest breed of people who rep the street and spit poetically 
 Never sleep, rest assured Mega is dope in his pure form 
 The dealer/MC keepin' it real is my protocol 
 Fall back I got you open off the style I was workin on it 
 The beat is lifeless, till I put my verses on it 
 I reminisce confinement as I read a kite 
 From my people with secret indictment freedom and triumph 
 Contemplating putting sprees on the tires 
 Dominating this beat with my rhyming as if you need a reminder 
 I spit that drug dealer shit you might have seen on The Wire 
 What other lyricist is known for giving people cosignment 
 I'm eager with rhyming, I rock Iceberg jeans with Nikes 
 In extremists with rapping that's deep as Posidan 
 Breedin' in violence now I live in a peaceful environment 
 A secret asylum from the streets where people be wilding 
 Some probably will fear me from seeing me shining 
 Like a phoenix arising from the dep show in the reef with defiance
