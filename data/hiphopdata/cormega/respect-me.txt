(Feat. Dona) 
 Aiyyo, real niggaz live off of principles 
 If you want it bad enough, I'ma give it to you 
 If your nigga ain't faithful, then fuck him too 
 I don't trust to many niggaz, just roll with a few 
 East New York, flooded with Bloods 
 I took care of responsibilities before I turned to Dove 
 They quick to judge when they see me in the streets but fuck 'em 
 Y'all don't really live like me, in the hood like me 
 With crackheads and dopefiends unconditionally 
 I show love to the niggaz whose real with me and reality friends is hard to keep 
 I can't trust nobody in the industry, motherfuckers don't want to see Dona eat 
 I never been the type to panic, fall under pressure in despair and vanish 
 Respect me, I'm respect you 
 Niggaz ain't stupid, they know who to step to 
 Don't get it twisted, if you feel something handle your business 
 Real niggaz recognize realness 
 For years I've been waiting for this moment 
 My feelings wrapped up in this moment, I can't control it 
 Driven by something bigger than a dollar sign 
 And momma always said make best of the worst times 
 For the first time, I see shit clearly 
 Writing at the table with captain crunch and dairy (?) 
 Dare to be nothing like them, they turned their backs on God 
 And he gave his only son, am I'm the only one whose keeing it real 
 We struggle everyday just to eat a decent meal 
 Keep a roof over our heads and over dead prez, they shooting at our heads 
 And either way, our children suffer from lead 
 You don't want to see me make it 
 Rather see me dead/but real bitches do gangsta things 
 I do whatever nigga to feed my team 
 Seven days out of the week, I'm on my j-o-b 
 Little to know sneak (?), my fam gotta eat 
 Fuck trying to get by, we multiply 
 In my hood everyday a young nigga dies 
 It's a blessing to be alive, hungry to get these pies 
 I drop versus, niggaz feel deep inside 
 No question, it's a respect thing, I'ma keep it real with Tims and Pepe 
 All the money in the world couldn't change the way I think 
 Streets are watching every move I make 
 These niggaz are fake always coming at you wrong 
 Brownsville still going strong 
 Friends become enemies, nigga you never been a friend of me 
 Always pretending to be my closet friend 
 Like I'm stupid enough to let you in
