Nas: What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together? 
 What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together? 
 (From Illmatic, "One love") 
 Cormega:Yeah I'm about to write this letter, lay it down you know? 
 Verse One: 
 Dear Nas 
 What up son it's Mega 
 I got your letter 
 Me and my cousin Oogie here together 
 A yo your man Duke came through 
 You should know the situation 'cause we dealing with the same crew 
 And you can tell that crabb shorty I'm a hurt her 
 For fucking with them niggas from that crew she know we want to murder 
 A yo that shit about Jerome's neice is foul 
 She was bringing niggas mad loud when we was locked down 
 Put around town the 4 pounds of glocks 
 On the dime block 
 Labels are marked now they have they full time lock 
 Son fuck the stupidness 
 Shorty be trooping it 
 Next time you see her hit her off with some loot and shit 
 Don't forget the kicks I already got flicks 
 Big Ice hit bricks from c-76 
 Homocide thieves are ready to blitz 
 Travelers think 
 String with the grin his razor blade blew six 
 A yo... 
 One love, one life, one mind dreaming 
 Son one day I'm leaving 
 One thug showing you love for one reason 
 For all my niggas that's locked down and bleeding (2x) 
 (Yo yo) 
 Anyway I heard Black Jay was getting paper 
 Tell my nigga Nut his man Bass is here from Jamaica 
 I was holding down a fourth and for a other ton 
 You couldn't touch a jack unless you had gats or box cutters 
 I seen an ox cutter, so many features 
 Niggaz sneaking up and blowing motherfuckers for their sneakers 
 I seen this kid cut police up, for real muney creeped up 
 Slid the ills out and blew the beast up 
 Yo handcuffs can make a man tough and suffer 
 My rhymes keep your mind stimulated like a la puffer 
 Yo this life is type bugged 
 I'm surrounded by dope fiends and thugs 
 But I'm a still maintain my brain frames so... 
 One love, one life, one mind dreaming 
 Son one day I'm leaving 
 One thug showing you love for one reason
