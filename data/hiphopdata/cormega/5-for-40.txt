Son I was a young nigga hustling 
 Me serving a D was unheard of, unless a D served me 
 Speak words superbly, its clear you heard me 
 Your idea of a real nigga changed 
 I'm into bigger things 
 I'm tryin' to maintain the same aim of prisoners 
 Drug dealers and my niggas who gangbanged 
 The game changed, shit is on fire 
 Niggas went from greatness to statements and wires 
 So scared to face a bid they betraying their suppliers 
 Sold to niggas outta state, you want weight you pay higher 
 I'm condemned yet exalted for words spoken cautious 
 Seen some of the biggest drug dealers blow fortunes in bathrooms 
 Niggas be sniffin like vacuums 
 I Reminisce to '88, the year crack ruled 
 I had Nike Delta Forces with them clear capsules 
 5 for 40, crackheads like "I only buy from Cory"
