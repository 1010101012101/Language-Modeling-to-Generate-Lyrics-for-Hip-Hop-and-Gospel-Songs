Life is a journey before I went the rap route 
 I serve niggaz off the bench like stack house 
 Goin' in with no intention to back down 
 My quote can't flow, solidified I spit crack now 
 You get consignment from my mental stash house 
 I'm back, droughts over fiends mouth foamin' 
 There's residue on the street my mics smokin' 
 Time to show these niggaz it's doe or die my eyes ain't closin' 
 Ever since I started rhymin' the crime rates lower 
 And I froze my watch 'cause time waits for no-one 
 Can fuck with NY when you think it's over 
 You stay comin' back like the Yanks with Hovers 
 I ain't livin' on the strength of no-one, controls my fate 
 I hold my weight and know my place 
 When I show my face it's all love 
 If not I say, fuck it, I don't mind hate 
 God all might I'm fallin' 
 The city never sleeps, look how tired New York is 
 Where I was born and raised is apart of ma aura 
 I'm too young to die, too old to try the corners 
 Truth be told I move weight before starvin' 
 Life has highs and lows like songs from Marvin 
 Police take lives and go free of all charges 
 Justice fucks us and conceives modest 
 So I open my eyes to the vision of Malcolm 
 I live for today yet I wish tomorrow 
 Is better than yesterday, don't exist no longer 
 I don't maintain, I elevate it, just go harder 
 With verses you sweat like a lyrical sauna 
 The message I am sendin' with the pen in my palm is 
 The hiatus is over, I have risen and conquered 
 Laugh now cry later, this is the karma 
 Hip hop never died, it's just sick of the drama 
 Apparently I realized my destiny's 
 To write about life in the street in it's complexities 
 In a city that never sleeps many dreams are never reached 
 I ain't afraid to fail if later it'll help succeed 
 I'm the same nigga but money changed everythin' 
 From location to patients, there's motivation for every scheme 
 Poetically I'm makin' a strong case concurrently 
 With the flow presently redefinin' my legacy 
 Life is purpose and goals, death is not doin' anythin' 
 Can be achieved if you believe eventually
