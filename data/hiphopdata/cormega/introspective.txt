(Cormega) 
 I killed her with +The Realness+ now I'm bringin' her life 
 Prestige is an illusion people tend to lose sight 
 I will always be Cory, youngest child of Dorothy 
 My brown eyes mirrors the pure ferocity 
 I slung the E, held my first heat with curiousity 
 Slept with it, rep with it, streets empower me 
 I came from curses, cuffs, and suede Pumas 
 To painting slums as visual as James Evans Jr. 
 I became a criminal when few though I wasn't 
 My shot wounds, my birthmarks a thug injustice 
 And with the ??? 
 The quarters not working I question my purpose in life 
 It must be to write, son I'm very determined 
 I child of the ghetto like a very young Sherman 
 Bread not moldin, the chosen upholding 
 Unwritten laws of those behind walls closed in, picture me rollin' 
 But don't look at me differently on the strengh that I'm holdin' 
 This is Mega you never heard my chain got stolen 
 I pitch like Randy Johnson 
 Dudes needed work I assist like Magic Johnson 
 Before rap my name was ringing in the projects 
 We took the block and props of every gram cooked 
 The rap game a change gon' come like Sam Cook 
 And Big didn't give the crown up and this means 
 His unwilling departure still makes him king 
 Cor-mega, will forever still born in Bedstuy, never ran never will 
 My life is very real a tribeam couldn't measure my skill 
 Or +True Meaning+ who wanna bring it, I'm right here...
