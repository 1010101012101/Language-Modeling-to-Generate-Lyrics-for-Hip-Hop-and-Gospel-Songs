(Yo Son, this person's all on your shit) 
 Nah what's this?

 Not that nigga, not that nigga that nigga's too pretty 
 (You gotta do somethin' man, you gotta do somethin' man, word up) 
 Take that nigga to war 
 Yo Nature, listen man 
 In a ja'causezi flashin, splashin like a uzi BlASTIN 
 Much love for thugs, God bless B.I., askin 
 "Whattup with Cormega?" Live niggaz keep askin 
 The exhibition, flexin, throw my extra clip in 
 Chrome bugotti VVS's, check it 
 Niggaz talkin' bout, how real they kept it on record 
 Screamin out, Q.B.C. but don't rep it 
 Am I my brothers keeper or a faggot in love with reefer? 
 My Far Rock' niggaz would love to meet ya 
 "Life's a Bitch" but shit gets deeper, fuck gold chains and sneakers 
 I had dat, when cocaine was cheaper 
 Yo, who this fake nigga soundin like me? 
 You wanna be me, but can't see a thousand like me 
 I'm loungin, you're like bookies on housin 
 You see my team comin' and your heart starts poundin 
 You shook, getting paid off the book 
 Niggaz jeal-ous, my LS is off the hook 
 You see the Lex, you fake ass thug, you need respect 
 Or be another nigga that my fuckin' heater wet 
 My poetry is manifest, the words be correct 
 My empire rise, now my enemies are vexed 
 Yo Nature you finished, yo Nas you next 
 Yeah, clear my little man 
 YouknowhatI'msayin, Nas 
 It ain't nuttin personal, it's all business yaknahmsayin? 
 You let your little faggot ass man come around me 
 But my man got a few words he wanna say to you 
 Nature you fake cat, try to be down and got your chain snatched 
 Took the shit, and your little brother's tape back 
 Now you against the Mega star, puffin hundred stacks 
 In a Lex, LS, chewing on Escobars 
 But they too sweet, burn my teeth 
 Firm don't want no beef, burn the wonder 
 Five stars, Q.B. the Desert Storm 
 The Mobb exclusive, check out the new kid on the next hit 
 Find the illest kicks, play the strength, what the writer bent 
 Hover from night to light, now push the tightest shit 
 The tighest click, we're airtight 
 Roll deep and wear Air Nikes, some to scare some the bear type 
 But we rock mics and jams, like gats we cock twice 
 Runnin' with the pretty boys, bitches say that's not nice 
 Straight out the 'Bridge, my DeLorean, showbiz 
 And if you wanna sign me you can find me where the coke is 
 I'm a nightmare to "Street Dreamin" 
 Nigga your whole crew is twenty-two's, my dudes street sweepin 
 Prepared, never scared, ones to bolster Flex 
 I'm ill, everything's real, ain't no special effects 
 Yeah, bring the drama, I like the fuckin' trauma 
 A gladiator, rocking steel plated armor 
 Yeah, you wanna step to me, you'd better bring a referee 
 My name is 'Mega, y'all niggaz scared to death of me 
 Yeah your man asked, I'm like a Columbian refugee 
 Murder any nigga in sight, any day or night 
 You see me in a jet black Lex, the coke's white 
 Lampin on the Hill, that nigga Nature thought he ill 
 I fucked his ass up like I'm Holyfield 
 The Real Deal, Montana, drama for short 
 Of course, yeah, the fucking boss 
 Yeah, that nigga Nature talk about he takin' my spot 
 Took one punch to the face, and just dropped 
 It's over La, I don't even know why you even won't try to come at me 
 This is Cor motherfuckin Mega 
 You know I'm the baddest you fuckin' faggot 
 I'll fuck you up 
 That's why my man took your fuckin' gold chain 
 And now he's wearin your shit in the projects, you're a fuckin' bitch 
 Knahmsayin Nas? You need to you need to you need to 
 Get a fuckin' fireproof fuckin' van that's how you come through 
 The projects or niggaz'll burn your shit down 
 Them niggaz is idiots, yo 
 Talkin' about "Street Dreams" rockin' a pink ass suit 
 What the fuck kind of dreams you niggaz workin with, man? 
 Last crack y'all niggaz sold was y'all ass! 
 You fuck with me, you're fuckin' with the best, man, knahmsayin? 
 But y'all niggaz ain't ready for fucking war 
 Y'all ain't ready for the motherfuckin, the gun battles 
 Or the beatings on sight man 
 Don't fuck with me man, I got no more to say man 
 Trick ass bay-atches!
