Kids, don't get high 
 Mothafuckas had me up in this mothafucka 
 Last night and shit, I'm cocained the fuck up 
 Paranoid as a motha yo, I'm paranoid as a fucka 
 Yeah, fuck that yo, I fuck around and shit 
 I sprained both of my fuckin' fingers 
 This shit man a nigga need to get 
 I'm tired of gettin' high like that 
 Ain't nobody came in my mothafuckin' 
 School with no mothafuckin' drugs 
 Stop fuckin' wit me niggas, stop fuckin' wit me 
 Nigga, that shits all in my family, nigga 
 Stop fuckin' wit me, the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? 
 On the strength, what the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? 
 We've been here too many years to stop fuckin' wit me 
 Nigga I'm scared of the trigga 
 While I'm the life giver and the life taker 
 I'm your father-in-law, married to mother-in-law 
 Got the universe movin' in the form of the sea-saw 
 You killed 2pac and Biggie, you know they was rollin' wit me 
 You paid for your stupidity 
 You can't do nothin' to me, I let your fuckin' fly free 
 Nigga, I'm pioneerin' all the sound ya hearin' 
 Earth from steerin', high mountaineerin' 
 I sincerely fuck you up severely by the yearly 
 Keep the sky clearly, I'm straight from the seventies 
 Mockneck colors wit ya bitch ass disappearin' 
 Give me clearance, I don't want no fuckin' interference 
 I'm the big black Jesus 
 Throw ya hands in the air! And wave 'em, fuckin' Wu don't care 
 And if ya [unverified] 
 Like we're [unverified] let me hear ya say, oh yeah 
 Oh yeah! Well, oh yeah! 
 I smoke woolers too, I majored the dust 
 Uh, it's legal for me 
 I drink everything, I don't give a fuck 
 It's part of the universe 
 Hey, what else I do? I do what I do 
 Man, fuck that, I stays high 
 I don't give a fuck 
 I be the rap head and the mic's my pipe 
 I'm about to get everybody high tonight 
 You ain't had no cool shit like this since '95 
 My cuffie tribe is mad live, people do or die 
 And I be comin' with the good shit, somethin' like dope 
 I know you smoke it, but you won't get high, off this note 
 Have you up, really up like cocaine, you thought you could reign? 
 But all you did was throw mad pain like diamonds 
 You could say I'm the lady's best friend 
 And when it come to makin' lyrics, I'ma represent 
 Yo, climbin' the charts like a cat 
 I'm rollin' with mad clips and gats 
 I can't be stopped, like this is Shitty City 
 Kids, don't use drugs 
 Drug free, drug free, drug free 
 Drug free, drug free, drug free 
 Drug free, drug free 
 Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun 
 Dunh, do, do, do, duh, duh, duh 
 Dun, dun, dun 
 Maybe I was a fool, dun, do, na, na, na 
 When you say gettin' high wasn't cool, do, na, na, na 
 When I got used to this stuff, dun, duh, na, na, na 
 Wasn't enough 
 Drug free, drug free, drug free 
 Yo bow down, we in the war with no images 
 I know you're feelin' us, DV's and Black Jesus 
 [Unverified] niggas better hit the deck 
 And ya chick better give us respect, respect 
 Eh-yo, my spit squad break ho's in like cavities 
 On the majority, shit you kick been borin' me 
 It's real logical, gain my strength, the biological 
 The role model, rock ya cradle, no one's survivin' me 
 The God show to yo' respect, we need to bless you 
 On some other, under the weather, we undercover 
 Stick stickin' 'em, shakin' 'em down, you know the program 
 Get wit it, venoms and Wu, we stay committed 
 Committed, what, what, what? Uh huh 
 Baby, baby Jesus, baby Jesus 
 Deadly venoms, chameleon, poison, scorpion, viper 
 Chameleon, poison, scorpion, viper 
 (Brooklyn zu) 
 Lemme tell y'all fuckas somethin' 
 I ain't got nothin' against no one 
 Y'all fuckas always go somethin' against me 
 Fuck you, men in black, drug free
