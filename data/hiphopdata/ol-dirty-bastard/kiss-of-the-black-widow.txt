Let me tell y'all all something motherfuckers 
 (Oh you complaining about that man?) 
 Yeah, them motherfuckers belong to us 
 Straight up, tell all y'all motherfucking hoes 
 Y'all motherfuckers know what's the fucking time 
 You think we don't love you motherfuckers? 
 Run in to the motherfucking courts 
 With all that bullshit, motherfuka 
 I'm letting all y'all motherfuckers know 
 I'm getting tired a that shit 
 You motherfucking triple breed motherfuckers 
 Bitches we love you motherfucka 
 Bobby Digi, Bob Digital shit is critical 
 Laid the fuck up inside the hospital 
 It's a riddle of a sphinx bitch had me jinx wid hijinx 
 Cuban links snatched from my neck, it was the sex 
 This 12 ounce bottle of bex had me drunk 
 One night laid up wit the Ol' Dirt and ten bags of skunk 
 Just met this hoe last month 
 Lookin' like a Benz with a woofer in the trunk 
 I pushed up like a push-up stick 
 One hand up near my cheek the other hand was holdin' my dick 
 I said, "Power equal, boo" 
 RZA people, I be Bobby D-I-G-I too 
 (Is that right?) 
 Word and exact 
 Girl you got a smile that a make a nigga heart crack 
 (For real?) 
 Word to grill like a thousand dollar bill 
 Close your eyes count to three and click you heels 
 And we could end up at my place face to face 
 Butt naked I'll invade your inner space 
 Straight up boo, damn I can taste it 
 One drop of sperm the God wouldn't waste it 
 Over the quilt 
 I rather put it inside you so your breast be filled with milk 
 And we could lay up and I could squeeze until it tilts 
 My house built on stilts is bangin' like the Hilton 
 Look how you feelin', gimme some feeback boo 'cause I need that 
 (Look Bobby, where's the beer and the weed at?) 
 Look girl, shit I got more than a little 
 She set me up for the kiss of the black widow 
 You couldn't get a flick of the hype outfit 
 'Cause the way that I'ma dress this style is mad wild 
 Enough to make a crowd of women scream, oww 
 Whether at a party or just in bed 
 Or thoughts of Ason bitch keep that in your head 
 My beats are funky my rhymes are spunky 
 Sometimes I say, "Well motherfucka, what's the recipe?" 
 I don't know I ask my ma, she don't know 
 Go ask ya poppa 
 It's all about me in the place to be 
 Nigga you all that, uh 
 Motherfucka that shit is due it's mad 
 Motherfucking game and it's a goddamn shame 
 How many motherfuckas wanna know this name, Ason 
 Yo I lock on, pass the break, shake and motivate, stimulate 
 By this ways that you dying you have in your clutch 
 Fall in love like a drug, call out into her love flood 
 Fuck her so much dunn you'll only bust blood 
 Caught inside the scud missile grip like tissue 
 Now I'm laid up inside the hospital 
 Bobby Digital's on critical 'cause the testicles is drained 
 Huh, huh 
 Nah, I ain't doing it right, right? 
 Huh
