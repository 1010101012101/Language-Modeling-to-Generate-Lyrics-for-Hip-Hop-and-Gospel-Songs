Bitches! 
 Ha ha ha! 
 Bitches, ha! 
 Bitches 
 Bitch, at any moment, that's what I'll do 
 (You fucking bitches) I'll do it to you 
 And a few of your crew 
 At any moment (yeah), that's what I'll do 
 (I-c-p, o-d-b) I'll do it to you 
 And a few of your crew 
 (Bitches!) 
 Bitch! what the fuck?! 
 What are you trying to do to me? 
 You wasn't true to me 
 When I was locked up you fucked something like 34 guys 
 But I let that slide 
 'Cause your ass is big, and your titties is fat 
 I wanted to fuck that 
 But fuck that 
 I never gave a fuck that, you put me through the courts (and?) 
 And gave me genital warts 
 Now I stack my .9, I'm goin' for the knees 
 I'm a blow 'em out and give your neck a squeeze 
 As you're standing there, I'm a be like bitch! 
 (Ha ha!) you know you done fucked up, right? 
 Girl you know I love you, but now you gotta die 
 (Now you gotta die, now you gotta die) 
 Girl you know I love you, but now you gotta die 
 (Never wanted it like that) 
 (Never wanted it like that) 
 Bitch, don't talk about bitches I'm fucking them 
 Please no fat bitches I'm fucking slim 
 Unless it's one of those nights I'm stroking my shit 
 I don't care 'bout how I'm fucking it 
 How much it costs, big fat, crackhead? 
 Ain't trying to hear all those words you said 
 Five minutes, bitch (ah) and I came 
 Fuck your name, and from where you came 
 I don't give a fuck, bitch! 
 I will kill you! 
 You Shaquita! 
 You Belinda! 
 You too passion, bitch! 
 (Ah, you bitches!) 
 One thing I can't stand is these bitches 
 Trying to take my riches, when I ain't even got none (bitch!) 
 I never lied, you knew what I wanted all the while (what?) 
 My dick in your vertical smile (yeah) 
 We kiss and hug, and snug, and tickle 
 But the bitch wouldn't even buff my fucking pickle (bitch) 
 You fucked everybody else in the place, it's all good 
 Now let me head-butt your face! 
 Bitch! I love you, but now you gotta die 
 That's right (bitches!), that's right 
 Girl you know I love you, but now you gotta die 
 (Bitches? bitches!) 
 Girl you know I love you, you dumb bitch!
