(Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (Baby Sham)) 
 Yo, this Dirt McGirt representin' Brooklyn 
 We gettin' ready to wreck shit up, downtown, uptown 
 (Boroughs, y'all niggaz better know it's something) Wu-Tang, bitch 
 (Get ya fuckin' head punched ya fuckin' shoulders, duke 
 This is how we do, everyday, blast through your motherfuckin' speaker, nigga) 
 Bastards! 
 (Chorus: Baby Sham) 
 Uh, we be so caked up, y'all best wake up 
 It's just us and we livin' this up 
 We sip that cognac, then lean far back 
 It's just us, and we flippin' the truck 
 Don't be so gassed up, be foul, assed up 
 When them coroners, pickin' you up 
 First you was in a black tux, now you all axed up 
 You smashed what, like you givin' it up 
 (Ol' Dirty Bastard) 
 I'm good with them free throws, like I play ball 
 When the war is on, it's McGirt that you call 
 The last man standing, heavy with the cannon 
 Come through on a bike, with a bulletproof, prancin' 
 Leave you in your pearl, put you on the porch, dancin' 
 And leave your brains on the back of a white shirt 
 While they playin' some old school shit by Al and Bert 
 (To all my bitches that smell like perfume, Dirt McGirt be here for you baby) 
 I'm not gonna stop till I'm under the dirt 
 (Baby Sham) 
 You can never be as half as me 
 'Cause one thing'll lead to another, cock sucker, melt ya knees 
 And make sure that your casket's deep 
 'Cause my trigger finger's itchin' like Athlete's feet 
 So stand wise, when you meet the chief 
 And watch your movements in the circle of the ultra-beast 
 I'm that nigga that'll culture speak 
 Whose gon' ride, whose gon' die, divorce your peeps 
 It get's worse on the down reaking 
 So please, dog, do you a favor, move from around me 
 'Cause I set my boundaries, you wanna know where I'm from 
 Ask Bust' where he found me, true B 
 Paper chasin', Franklin' raping 
 And for sure, I'm gonna make my statement 
 And believe that the shit is taken 
 'Cause the gun, playin' long, like vacations 
 (Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard) 
 We lay the law down, motherfucker 
 Big Moses in the motherfucker house 
 Any way that nigga go out, that's how the nigga go out 
 Grand capo
