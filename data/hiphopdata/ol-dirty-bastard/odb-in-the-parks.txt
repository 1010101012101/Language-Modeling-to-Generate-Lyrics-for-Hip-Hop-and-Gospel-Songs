 High impact, youknowhatI'msayin'? 
 They they had me pickin' cigarettes 
 (Slam) 
 A thousand cigarettes up off the floor 
 Doin' push-ups, all that bullsh 
 Yo, I'm tryin' to 
 (Slam) 
 I just wanna give a shout, to all the jails everywhere 
 'Cause you know, I know it's a game 
 (Just slam) 
 YaknowhatI'msayin'? The government got a game 
 Get all the brothers locked down 
 (This one, is a hit, it's called slam) 
 But it ain't like that, baby

 Yo, yo bust this, yo white boy, don't you got a shadow? 
 Black boy don't you got teeth, what the fuck is the beef? 
 Some tame buck nigga in the movie, said a little poetry 
 Had some problems with the cops 'cause his man gun was hot 
 And of course, fuck that red tape 
 (Guilty) 
 I gotta spit at y'all, they runnin' some shit on y'all 
 Or should I say yes, 'cause I'm still on the bus 
 So y'all is really me it's just, y'all is already you 
 I hereby do declare, all of us is we 
 Quit your silly-ass games and, petty-ass dirts see and put 
 Greed to the side for good 
 For your heart it's like a court minus time divide 
 Doin' it at the park

 A dubba, dubba, dah 
 We live in a society created by an empire that's based on terror 
 Welcome to the One World Era 
 A complete interruption to your lil' paltry ass life 
 That you thought you was livin' and what you been given 
 No more Benzes to roll in, fat-ass stacks of money 
 Cause ain't no such thing as money, I bet y'all niggaz think it's funny 
 Put your money where your mouth or where your mouth used to be 
 'Cause ain't shit on this planet, or in this life for free 
 We gonna do it like Osirus and The Warriors in the dark 
 Get your niggas and my niggas and some mo' niggas 
 And have a meetin' in the park 
 Lost in the sauce, cause you think you got force 
 Get this across, there is only one boss 
 A nuh got it locked down, while nuh be dumbfound 
 And got all on the surround 
 Who you think own the ships planes and trains? 
 Now you got a white man's name 
 Doin' it at the park 
 Doin' it, la, la, la 
 Oh' yeah, rock the park 
 Oh' yeah, rock the park 
 Doin' it at the park 
 Doin' it, la, la, la 
 Oh' yeah, rock the park 
 Oh' yeah, rock the park 
 Yo whassup son? 
 Yo whassup loc? 
 You ready to heat it up at make this system smoke? 
 Blaow, blaow, blaow 
 We want knowledge, we want wisdom 
 Y'all want bars, Cristal and bitches 
 We want off shore bank accounts, property 
 We wanna show you how to do it, properly 
 Fuck your friends, stack your ends 
 The next time somebody tryin' to run game, then pretend 
 That they runnin' game then, run game back and 
 Yo, let him let him roll off in' his Cadillac 
 'Cause real players play the back 
 Old school flavor 
 Doin' it at the park 
 Doin' it, la, la, la 
 Oh' yeah, rock the park 
 Oh' yeah, rock the park 
 Doin' it at the park 
 Doin' it, la, la, la
