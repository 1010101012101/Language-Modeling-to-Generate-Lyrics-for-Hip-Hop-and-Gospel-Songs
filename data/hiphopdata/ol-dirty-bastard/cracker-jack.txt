"C'mon baby, c'mon c'mon baby" repeats 
 In background all throughout the song 
 "You bitches can't do nothin" repeats 
 In background through intro 
 (Intro: ODB) 
 It's Ol' Dirty Bastard and shit, knowI'msayin? 
 I wanna give a big shout out to my nigga Luke 
 KnowI'msayin? You know, you know, know 
 I wanna lock all the bitches down 
 I wanna lock all the bitches down from the North, 
 To East, to West, to South 
 KnowI'msayin? 
 I wanna... help me put these bitches in my trance 
 I want y'all to suck my lizard 
 You bitches wanna fuck me when you smell my under-arm 
 (ODB) 
 I make yo' dick disappear 
 I ain't hearin anymore weird sounds in the ear 
 PSSSSSSS... you can't purr no more 
 You wanna kneal and suck dick? I'ma keep your throat sore 
 Bitches got herpes in ya ass 
 Every time you fuck a nigga, he dies fast 
 And you won't last 
 The pussy break down from a rash 
 It's hard for you to walk, 'cause you stuck up in your ass 
 Don't ask me for no cash 
 You better not be tellin' me to give them no cash 
 Ash, bash, crash, sad ass 
 (Chorus: ODB) 
 Give me a little of that Cracker Jack 
 You ain't caramel coated Cracker Jack 
 The surprise, bitch you gonna get waxed 
 This that shit, you can't do nothin' about 
 (ODB) 
 Girls ain't pretty to me anymore 
 'Cause you ain't bein a real whore 
 Ooh, you ain't a real whore 
 *Yells some crazy shit* 
 You can't say, wear nails anymore 
 You ain't givin' up, a manicure 
 Suckin my dick is gonna be your chore 
 If you don't, you're punishment 
 You can't get off until ya suck my dick 
 Physically I operate your brain to function 
 Give me anything, that I wantin 
 All girls wanna fuck me everyday 
 And give me that, the money 
 Don't even know what happens naturally 
 Especially when I'm playin' with the chemistry 
 The money comin' to me first 
 You gonna keep dyin' till you die from thirst 
 I want a different girl everyday 
 If you wanna die, you gotta drink my sperm 
 The other way to die, is eat a can of worms 
 (Outro: ODB) 
 Give me a little... 
 Yo, I love you girls 'cause you wanna stick your tongue up in my ass 
 Or you can't taste, smell, touch or hear, or see 
 I got you in a smash, give me it! 
 (Instrumental for next 58 seconds)
