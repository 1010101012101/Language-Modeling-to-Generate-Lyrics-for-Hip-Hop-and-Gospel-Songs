Fame, Cars, Lights stay on you 
 Cameras flashing for you 
 I'd trade it all 
 On the way to happiness 
 What's the price of fame? 
 Yeah 
 Yo, what's attracting people to the life of fame? 
 The nights away binging, getting blind for days 
 Would you expect a tidal wave of guys 
 All disguised as mates to try to take a slice of that pie you made? 
 When you're famous, you're the person people love to hate 
 Are you prepared for all the rumours and the lies they say? 
 Yo, looking back at life, I'd never thought I'd come this far 
 Yo, I'm just thankful people welcomed me with open arms 
 All these new friends and people that I hope to trust 
 Try to take advantage, got me thinking what their motives are? 
 Girl, if your lights on, on your iPod and it's my song 
 Than drive on, 'cause a fan is not what I want 
 Fame, Cars, Lights stay on you 
 Cameras flashing for you 
 I'd trade it all 
 On the way to happiness 
 What's the price of fame? 
 Fame, Cars, Lights stay on you 
 Cameras flashing for you 
 I'd trade it all 
 On the way to happiness 
 What's the price of fame? 
 Yeah 
 Imagine it, never thought I'd be havin' it 
 Keep belief and be confident 
 But stay away from that arrogance 
 Yeah, I'm cashing in 
 That ain't what'll bring happiness 
 And I'm lucky, making a living off of this music 
 That's what my passion is 
 And I could go and buy a crazy, fresh Mercedes-Benz 
 But I would rather help my mates in debt and pay their rent 
 Yo, I could make a trip to ATMs at 8am 
 After I've been placing bets and partying for days on end 
 Look what'll happen if I never see the same success 
 Yo, in the schemes of things, I think there's better ways to spend 
 When I was young, I saw my grandpa get laid to rest 
 And what I've got, I'd trade it in 
 If I could see his face again 
 Fame, Cars, Lights stay on you 
 Cameras flashing for you 
 I'd trade it all 
 On the way to happiness 
 What's the price of fame? 
 Fame, Cars, Lights stay on you 
 Cameras flashing for you 
 I'd trade it all 
 On the way to happiness 
 What's the price of fame? 
 Think about all the money made 
 Think about what you wanted babe 
 Ain't about all the money made 
 Think about what you wanted babe
