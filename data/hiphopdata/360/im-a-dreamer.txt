I, day dreaming every day 
 My head's so far away 
 Excuse me when I say 
 I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer 
 Oh, I'm up before the birds 
 Groundhog day, let my dreams replay 
 Good morning, am I really awake 
 Or am I lost in the moment in the dreamy state 
 Thinking back to the days when it was all simple 
 Sap, hip, politics, no big issue 
 Win some, lose some, go and brush it off man 
 But now days everybody's got it twisted 
 No time to love but plenty of time to dis you 
 Why they miss you, I see the way 
 Yeah I, yeah I'm a dreamer, a true believer 
 Pray for better days hoping things will change 
 So I, let the sun shine wash away the pain 
 Live to see the day when my kids can say 
 It's been a long time coming through 
 The change in the air and it all feels good (we made it) 
 I, day dreaming every day 
 My head's so far away 
 Excuse me when I say 
 I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer 
 I, day dreaming every day 
 My head's so far away 
 Excuse me when I say 
 I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer 
 And I'm a dream, I'm a dream, I'm a dreamer 
 He says not possible, I don't believe ya 
 I live my life, live my life to the fullest 
 I walk around, all peaceful like a Buddhist 
 So check me out, if your mind is a mess now 
 You always tryna hide that you're stressed out 
 Man, you need to chill out, take a deep breath, 
 Think what it's really bout 
 I, remember when I was a child 
 I was so wild, couldn't keep me in the house 
 I'd be out all day playing in the park 
 My mum called my name every time it gets dark 
 'Cause I come from a place where you only get nightmares 
 People shout it down so you never put it out there 
 Keep it to yourself, and that's what it's best kept 
 This is the recipe, behind my success, so 
 I, day dreaming every day 
 My head's so far away 
 Excuse me when I say 
 I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer 
 I, day dreaming every day 
 My head's so far away 
 Excuse me when I say 
 I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer 
 I'm sitting in a room and I'm daydreaming 
 How this success is a strange feeling 
 Will it all last? Or will it all pass? 
 And all this random shit that my brain deals with 
 Yeah, I got my head in the clouds 
 Random raps, got the phone out to get it all down 
 Thinking 'bout the next show and expecting a crowd 
 Too excited, got a Valium to settle me down 
 Spent years home at mum and dads messing around 
 But now my favorite part of it is my parents are proud 
 Never listen to the hater if you getting me down 
 And no words are ever stopping me progressing my sound, no 
 Stay positive, I do prefer this 
 Looking forward to the things that I can do with my kids 
 And I'm thinking bout flying to the moon to work this 
 Cause the sky ain't the limit, yo the universe is, and 
 I, day dreaming every day 
 My head's so far away 
 Excuse me when I say 
 I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer 
 I, day dreaming every day 
 My head's so far away 
 Excuse me when I say 
 I'm a dreamer, yes I'm a dreamer
