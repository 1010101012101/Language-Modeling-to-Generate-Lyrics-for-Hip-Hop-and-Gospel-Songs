Yo, hey yo it's me myself and I 
 Yeah I'm back again 
 I played the background watching what's been happening 
 I never thought when I was fucking up in school that this shit would even work 
 If it doesn't I'll be cool 
 Even if for now I only manage to scrape by 
 As long as I'm living off of rap it's a great life 
 So I'm gonna take my ways I create this 
 And take time cock back and aim at a great height 
 This is it though, I'd better step forward then 
 It's a chance to be forever airborne 
 But I'm never happy with the second best score 
 While I'm chasing after a dream I never slept for 
 Just to get my rap on 
 Talking about whatever I have done 
 Find believe even when I have none 
 So fuck it, I'm about to have fun 
 And not think about this life, 'cause we only have one 
 I'm sorry that I'm so late, yo I slept in 
 You can't blame me, I was having the best dream 
 I was watching my life up on the big screen 
 Had the president on pause, flicking to the next scene 
 It had me and everybody coming together 
 Sky high while we're running the heaven 
 Let me take you to a place where it's summer forever 
 So there'll be no chance in hell of feeling under the weather 
 But look, I know that I can be whatever I believe 
 I keep my feet grounded and bring the sky to me 
 Most people have grown egos 
 But it's so see through, I'll show that there's no need too 
 Even go that route 
 I did it before, but see I know that now 
 But see I know it's hard, but I laugh in the face of death 
 While living life on the edge without a safety net 
 Lets go 
 I heard the sky is falling down, but that's me flying up again 
 The sky is falling, falling, 
 I see the sky is falling down, though they got me going up again 
 The sky is falling, falling, 
 I'm falling again 
 See I know it's a fight to the top 
 And any other day, yo you're likely to flop 
 Some lies will arise in your eyes and entice you to stop 
 But the sky is the prize that I want 
 And now to show my style and to boast my skills 
 And I don't know how but I know I will 
 'Cause I have to be the best 
 It's win win for me 'cause rap relieves the stress 
 The industry now is in a big crisis 
 It's innocently down (loading?) by these kid pirates 
 And if your listen out and think this shit fire, 
 Stop being ignorant now, you think it's sick, buy it 
 Uh, I understand if you don't buy it 
 Supporters need the supporters who go find it 
 But for now I'm gonna go flying 
 I'm so high that you won't find me so don't try it 
 I heard the sky is falling down, but that's me flying up again 
 The sky is falling, falling, 
 I see the sky is falling down, though they got me going up again 
 The sky is falling, falling, 
 I'm falling again, ah ha, 
 'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying 
 The sky is falling, falling, 
 'Cause even when I'm falling I'm flying 
 I know your trying to call me down, down, 
 The sky is falling, falling, 
 Before the sky will reach the ground 
 I heard the sky is falling down, but that's me flying up again 
 The sky is falling, falling, 
 I see the sky is falling down, though they got me going up again 
 The sky is falling, falling, 
 I'm falling again 
 The sky is falling
