I'll challenge your team to a brawl 
 Motherfucker, I won't mean it at all 
 So if this shit hits the fan 
 I ain't cleaning the walls, no 
 I'm with a grumpy whore, 
 Looking for some drugs to score 
 We need to pull it together, tug o' war 
 When I was born I wasn't fucking around 
 Doctor pulled me out the womb 
 I punched the cunt in the mouth 
 Oi, you touchin' my mum? 
 Check out my bone structure 
 Look, styles man, I'm so fucking good 
 Even my own mother would 
 Yo, yo I'm a motherfucking thug homie 
 Hell yeah, I like to rob a lot 
 I ain't no b-boy but you'll see me popping locks 
 I'm a break into you bottle shop 
 Smash all your dodgy scotch 
 And start lining up some vodka shots 
 Everything's looking up right now 
 Maybe that's because I'm hanging upside down 
 If I get famous I'm a brown eye the paparazzi 
 After I tap my arse cheeks just to camouflage me 
 Whose arse is that?

 Yo, uh yeah, I'm a be the first Aussie up on MTV crib 
 Showing you my room full of M16 clips 
 What cunt, yes me three six 
 My next tat is gonna be a mp3 link

 Tommy fucking said 
 The color yellow is the shit 
 That's why I think that Elmo is a prick 
 I gotta let you know I've got an elbow on my dick 
 So if you're interested, then come and watch me flex it 
 And maybe you can sex it 
 And you will leave impressed bitch 
 We drinking Mai-tai's 
 Then we say goodnight, bye 
 Head home and have sex 
 While we listen to The White Stripes 
 Nah, I'm a nice guy 
 Yeah I like the lime light 
 But I'm confused as fuck 
 Cause it ain't tasting like a lime white
