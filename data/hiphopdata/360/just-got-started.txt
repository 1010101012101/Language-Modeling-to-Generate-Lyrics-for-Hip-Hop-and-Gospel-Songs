Uh... yeah 
 I feel 'em, I feel 'em... they trying to slow us down. 
 We hear 'em, we hear 'em but see we don't know how. 
 Now I'm seeing what I need to be, 
 Running on through with a need for speed. 
 One of the few with something to prove 
 And nothing to lose, so leave us be. 
 If you feel like there's nothing to live for, 
 Honestly why the fuck would you live for. 
 That's the reason I give it all, 
 But still feel the need to give a little more. 
 Uh, now I feel like there's nothing more to say, 
 Uh... I understand what I'm in it for. 
 I know I could run this all the way, 
 I won't get another chance if I miss it all. 
 See if could have a crystal ball... I wouldn't, 
 Because I like it when there's risk involved. 
 It's the stuff, life's so rare, 
 It's too fast... I don't care. 
 I know we just got started, baby I don't care... whoa... 
 I know we just got started, baby I don't care... whoa ooh 
 I feel 'em, I feel 'em... they trying to slow us down. 
 We hear 'em, we hear 'em but see we don't know how. 
 See we all need an outlet, 
 But it seems it's a dream that most people ain't found yet. 
 I knew it was out there, some how from the outset. 
 But believe me, it ain't easy picking a different route, 
 It took a bit of living to figure out. 
 Most keep on fitting in with the crowd. 
 I don't fight it, there's no time to slow ride it. 
 It'll all go by you, shit, life is too short to cruise forth, 
 Gotta keep improving and move forward, 
 Let the rest all happen in due course. 
 Down there I've been there before, don't want to be anymore. 
 So hold steady while I walk this tight rope, 
 I know I might fall... but I don't care. 
 I know we just got started, baby I don't care... whoa oh oh oh 
 I know we just got started, baby I don't care... whoa ooh 
 Whoa... oh oh! [x4] 
 I know we just got started, baby I don't care... whoa ooh oh oh! [x5]
