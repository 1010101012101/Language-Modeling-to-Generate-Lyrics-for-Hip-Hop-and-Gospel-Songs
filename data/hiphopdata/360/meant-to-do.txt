I dunno what I want to change, 
 But I know I shouldn't stay the same. 
 I dunno what I want to do, 
 And I dunno what I want from you. 
 So I'm on my way looking for another one to get me through, 
 It's my bad if I met with you, when you left confused. 
 What the fuck am I meant to do, 
 What the fuck am I meant to do, 
 What the fuck am I meant to do, with you. 
 See you know the girl, yeah you know the type. 
 Though she doesn't know the world, but she knows a fight. 
 She wants a boyfriend now, go and have a closer look. 
 Talk about a bad choice, yo she wrote the book. 
 She's been talking to this guy for a while and he wants in, 
 But he's a nice guy, so she don't want him. 
 But why is it that the ones that are bad for you, 
 Always seem to be the ones she's attracted to 
 Yo it's the same shit, yo you have to chill. 
 You turn a small thing into a massive deal. 
 See you don't have to care but, 
 We have a good week and then it's back to square one. 
 In this life that you lead, 
 Most the time you just fight with the weak 
 Then you cry as the cycle repeats. 
 But you don't think it's a problem 
 I guess the first step is admitting you've got one. 
 What the fuck am I meant to do, 
 What the fuck am I meant to do, with you. 
 Yo I don't know who you are, where'd you come from 
 Why you getting so mad, where's the love gone 
 Why I feel like there's something that I've done wrong 
 And why I feel like you're someone I should run from 
 Hey yo it's endless, 
 Listen to me come on, I don't want to punch on. 
 I feel like I'm fighting myself with no gloves on. 
 Why is it that the ones that are bad for me, 
 Always seem to be the ones that are attracting me 
 'Cause she love me she love me, 
 But why she always wanna fucking erupt me. 
 It's never me though trust me it must be you. 
 Cause you always turn nothing into something. 
 True, but you stay upset. 
 I can't count each and everyday I've left. 
 I give it 24 hours till we break up next. 
 But I guess it's all worth it for the make up sex. 
 I dunno what I want to change, 
 But I know I shouldn't stay the same. 
 I dunno what I want to do, 
 And I dunno what I want from you. 
 So I'm on my way looking for another one to get me through, 
 It's my bad if I met with you, when you left confused. 
 What the fuck am I meant to do, with you. 
 Living in the sex and the drugs and the rock and roll. 
 I'll admit it though I lost control. 
 I met a girl with a positive soul, 
 She regretted that she ever went and got involved. 
 Couldn't handle all the people talking, 
 I let them keep going and I keep ignoring. 
 I'm past those days always keeping score, 
 And I said it and I meant it, that ain't me no more. 
 They seen the lights and it's seen me exciting, 
 But see as time goes by it is blinding. 
 See I really really wanna meet wifey, 
 But the way that I'm living ain't likely. 
 Yeah, being a rapper ain't getting me far. 
 I don't have a house or a pet or a car. 
 I'm 24 living in my parents' garage, 
 Safe to say that I'm off to a terrible start. 
 I dunno what I want to change, 
 But I know I shouldn't stay the same. 
 I dunno what I want to do, 
 And I dunno what I want from you. 
 So I'm on my way looking for another one to get me through, 
 It's my bad if I met with you, when you left confused. 
 What the fuck am I meant to do, 
 What the fuck am I meant to do, with you. 
 I dunno what I want to change, 
 But I know I shouldn't stay the same. 
 I dunno what I want to do, 
 And I dunno what I want from you. 
 So I'm on my way looking for another one to get me through, it's my bad, 
 What the fuck am I meant to do
