There ain't no limit to us now, 
 Cause Eventually always comes around, 
 Oh whether we die old or whether we die young, 
 Gotta live it up till is gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its 
 Had a cloudy head, yeah I know that 
 Since the fog cleared I'll never go back 
 And I'm grateful they shot me down or the person I am I would not be now 
 Yeah, it ain't good to be bullet proof cause in the end that bullet will be good for you 
 When I think of all the things that I wouldn't do now if it wasn't for that one little bullet wound 
 That means you've gotta learn for mistakes and no one persons the same 
 Don't run from anything that hurts you to face each step you take you get further away 
 There was a time when I thought of giving up what I was living my life for didn't come 
 Now I haven't got time for what I wouldn't die for I know that life's short so live it up 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Got to live it up 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Got to live it up 
 Life's a journey I know that and it doesn't come with a road map 
 So you know to get through this maze along the way I made a few mistakes 
 Ever since then I left it all behind, life's never been better 
 Head up in the clouds where it oughta be 'cause they say life's ordinary, but it not 
 Still for a minute I got in a rut, in prison I was limited and feeling stuck 
 Had my glass half empty had to fill it up now I think I want to get myself a bigger cup 
 That's how the cards are dealt will it stay that way, 
 Only time will tell when I think I want to cry for help I just try to remind my self 
 There ain't no limit to us now 
 Cause Eventually always comes around 
 Oh whether we die old or whether we die young 
 Gotta live it up till is gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its gone 
 Gotta live it up 
 I don't know what the future holds, I don't know if I'll achieve my goal 
 I just know life beautiful maybe that's 'cause I'm living it on cruise control 
 Cause truth be told it doesn't matter if you make the whole way up the ladder just as long as your living out your dream, 
 They used to me it was out of reach 
 But now I'm flying at a thousand feet never looking at the ground beneath see I got rid of all the doubt in me who I was ain't shit on what I'm about to be 
 Because growing up all I heard was the same story and if I don't learn well the blames on me so I started saying yes today to all the things I said no to yesterday 
 Oh whether we die old or whether we die young 
 Gotta live it up till its gone 
 Live it up till its
