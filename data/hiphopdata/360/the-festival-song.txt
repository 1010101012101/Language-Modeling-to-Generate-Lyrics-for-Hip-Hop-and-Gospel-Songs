For all the festival heads, check it out 
 All right it's that time of the year you've been waiting for, for months now 
 Saving up your pay trying to figure all your funds out 
 It's kinda funny when you think of all the fun how it's taken this long to shake last years come down 
 Forget the past, as soon as December starts 
 Grab your parents credit card and hope that you don't get in last 
 Yeah, 'cause if you let it pass these days a week late can mean paying triple when you bpay off ebay (true) 
 It's hard to figure out what tickets you want, should it be Falls Festival or Pyramid Rock? 
 Well for me, I really don't care 'cause I don't listen to rock, or hip hop 
 I just wear earplugs and sit there and watch 
 If your favourite band's there you'll think you'll never forget 
 You'll probably get that wasted you won't remember their set 
 But if you're a festival head then you already know the plan 
 Go and pack up all your shit 'cause you're going on a trip for those summer days 
 Summer days 
 Oh summer days 
 Summer days 
 For those summer days 
 I love summer days 
 Now when you finally make it there from driving up with your crew 
 You better get your mind set on finding something to do 
 'Cause you'll be stuck there lining up in the queue 
 Moving bumper-to-bumper until your arse hurts, all to get your car searched 
 And if your alcohol you're stressing 'cause you need it bad 
 Stashing bottles of vodka up in your sleeping bags 
 Maybe get a spare tyre with a heap of cans 
 It doesn't matter everybody has their secret plan 
 Once your crew start picking your spot 
 Unpacking, realise all the things you forgot, or shit that you lost 
 Man I swear I brought my pillows and socks 
 And dudes too excited already sitting there sloshed 
 It doesn't take long before you find somebody blazing up 
 Mate what are you doing, I said to save the bud for Xavier Rudd 
 It's always the cheap fuckers who ain't paid enough, yep 
 But please note that we don't condone taking drugs 
 Summer days 
 Summer days 
 Oh summer days 
 Summer days 
 I love summer days 
 I love summer days 
 Now as soon as the sun rises you'll be ready to start 
 At 6 o'clock standing there outside your tent with a glass 
 You're in it for the long haul, it doesn't end when it's dark 
 We all know you've got your friends to make your energy last 
 And you gotta time it so you peak it while the acts play 
 Try and jump the fence and start sneaking into back stage 
 If you get caught by police then try to act straight 
 Nah they're not those pills, I need them for my back pain 
 And dudes are flying saying to their mates "I love you man!" 
 Or on a walk so they can go and call their Mum and Dad (it's Pez) 
 And then there's people who so desperately just need a friend 
 They're going up to anybody trying to have a D
