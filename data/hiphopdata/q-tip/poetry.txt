QTip 
 Can you picture how a melody can stir into existence? 
 Rhythm section hits it and upholds it with persistanceyou start to see the colours 
 Filling in with intricate splashes by all the brothers 
 Michelle is on the joint, you mean Misindae Gayochello? 
 No wonder why the hump inside the joint is feeling ghettho 
 A medal or award should be giving to these heroes for their 
 Empasis of revealing and bringing forth the feeling 
 I'm realing, poetic I say, a great proportion, 
 I hold my little nuances correct for this distortion. 
 But I say, why say? and who is to say, 'cause 
 Roy makes the tune what it is today. 
 Rhythmically, we in the slake of jeans, know what I mean? 
 Its only right that me and Mr Right we here from Queens 
 The overtone of funk is being driven by this music 
 It's the benevolence of Roy issued me this juris-provence 
 This beat, or rhymes hooded in the epitome 
 I'm just a humble little germ, just a hipper version 
 Poetic I mean truly indeed her every steed 
 Just sprinkles with the essence of life to form my breed 
 Think about sweety while we give this to the needy 
 The musical expression is important for progression 
 Never stop learning lesson, and neither should y'all 
 Before we all stand, must acknowledge a fall 
 Before we get the bounce we got to reach for the ball 
 Before we ghettho strong we haf to get to a crawl 
 Check it out now, and don't you dare 
 Bobby Timmers did a joint called "That there" 
 Check it out now, and do your do 
 Ronny Foster did a joint called "Mr Brew" 
 Check it out now, its how we go 
 Check it out with my man Roy Hargrove - der der

 Brothers lost, my head is running veins 
 Where to go, and where is God 
 Sometimes I get real mad, but I understand 
 I don't beat myself up too much about it 
 I give us tears, does he mourn for it? 
 Or joy in return? Those tears bring joy 
 That is what perplexes, make the sweetness last 
 'Cause we're mourning for the joy, their hard to find 
 Be happy where you can, no sadness necessary, 
 No, no, it seems sometimes, you never get in bed 
 But its ok, its fair, yeah, ooh 
 Nowhere to look, you got me mysteries 
 Use the stars as a guide, trying not to hide 
 The love inside, you know, you if you get... you get 
 I feel, I'm not ready yet, but I meet myself halfway 
 And I'll start a day, creating what I'm... living 
 Living for today, 'cause I'm ok, its ok
