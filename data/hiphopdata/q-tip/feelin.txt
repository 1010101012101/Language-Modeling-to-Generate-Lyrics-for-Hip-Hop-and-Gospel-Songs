Had this good feelin' when I woke up today 
 Like everything was cool so I went on my way 
 I guess I walk with a bop so then this profilin' cop 
 Said wait a minute there yo don't tell me to stop 
 So this profilin' cop with his profilin' hands 
 Figured the best that he could do was find a cat to harass 
 That little kitten was me, not that one in a tree 
 A black one with the promises that wished to be free 
 I mean damn policeman can't you leave me alone 
 I'm a prince plus a poorper with this business I'm on 
 See this rackin' I'm in, needs somebody like me 
 All of us is concentratin' on the things that we see 
 How much we make, so you see it ain't great 
 We're not makin' this slate, 'cause it's juts in our fate 
 I refuse to get blue so just hand me that thing 
 Yo what's happenin' today? 
 Yo we Gotta bring back that feelin' 
 What happened to that feelin'?
