Sometimes I phase out 
 When I look at the screen 
 When I think about my chance for me 
 To intervene 
 And it's up to me to bring back the hop-e 
 Feeling in the music that you could quote 
 Not saying that I hate it cause here 
 I kinda dig it 
 But what good is a' ear 
 If a Q-Tip isn't in it 
 So to stick it in 
 To inform your friend 
 Your boy from the hood 
 Is on that shit again 
 He has upped the degreese 
 And dropped the mercury 
 To splash on the mass 
 And look to upper class 
 And win the records spins 
 That Sometimes goes a win 
 A fickleness of friends 
 They sometimes hate again 
 They always bring up tribe on me 
 Could not suprive on me 
 'Cause this is my man's on me 
 'Cause this is my fams 
 And here's somethin' new 
 It's from row for you 
 So don't miss 
 'Cause you was tribe on the true 
 My due sue hassle heart 
 Don't stop 
 Your repertoire 
 As long as you could see 
 It's you who's staying we 
 'Cause life is filled with mer... 
 Pills and little pearls and shit 
 I'm fucking up 
 A man 
 I'm tripp'n up 
 But still 
 There is a boy 
 Them people get annoyed 
 Who's focus is on the feel 
 Before we get a deal 
 Cum on! 
 Think it if life can be a thing 
 That wilderness is wild to me 
 But a trip all the... oad 
 I see we're just the same 
 Think that we're not 
 Where we should be 
 Movin' on we came to 
 Prefect on the street 
 Let's take it a pause 
 And ensure we eat 
 And open an end 
 To criticize the boys 
 They're out in between 
 They loose all their boys 
 They can't keep it down 
 With Dominic and Brown 
 And Doe's of other shades 
 They joy up a way 
 But wait this frame to add 
 Like brai... and cap a Pad 
 And magazine debris 
 A shit 
 She gotta see it 
 I'm no different to you 
 I goes through it too 
 I dumpes through the pages 
 I don't come a age 
 I'm not a D A T 
 I'm far from per... cy 
 I roll the tumble weed 
 It's just a humble scene 
 That I present to you 
 Is just a mister crue 
 Who burrs a harmony 
 And sum a melody 
 Just speaks to where we are 
 And don't a hopes a jar 
 A soon we're walking in 
 A blim to just to say 
 A cum on!
