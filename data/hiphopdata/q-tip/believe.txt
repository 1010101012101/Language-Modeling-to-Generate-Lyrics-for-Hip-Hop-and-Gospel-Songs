I believe thus love, thus love 
 I believe thus love 
 I believe thus love, thus love 
 I believe thus love 
 I believe love 
 Fool, uh of the things we believe there's a whole lot of work 
 We should roll up our sleeves and we got a whole fun 
 When faces I can see that 
 Why doubt your plans 'cause it's all worth believing 
 We can make it worth do believe 
 That evenness trust in the dust and believe 
 That we can achieve that by tuning out negative feedback 
 Next he is, can he be concentrate to bring believe back 
 Into ourselves, into the world, into the rap gang 
 He's a miserable that means, that means emotion even likes me man 
 Man look we holding out for the truth 
 But we alone and aloof, we gon' hold for the proof 
 Man put it in believing, believe in believing 
 Seeing ain't believing, it's the feeling that we needing 
 Believe in each other, put the question to the system 
 They promising returns then question what you gettin' 
 We should believe in the reasons we existing 
 Time for renaissance to reawaken what is with it 
 Belief can confirm, make it is but it isn't 
 Sometimes I wish I had belief when I didn't 
 I believe thus love 
 I believe thus love 
 In the land of make belief, time to make unbelievable believable 
 Take a believe to the realm of the real 
 Believe in this shit, this force fed to the medium 
 Believe in this real when it's really a raw deal 
 Never disbelieve when you see a new miracle 
 Like ghetto children shining bright in Babylon 
 Believe in that, don't believe in stats to the contrary 
 Gotta be wary of them their carry on 
 People find belief when they don't find identity 
 Believe in your friends, don't believe in your enemy's 
 Mountains of doubt and disbelief right in front of you 
 Troops on the other side, what you gon' do? 
 Ooh, ooh, believe 
 Ooh, thus love, thus love 
 Ooh, ooh, believe 
 Ooh, thus love, thus love 
 I believe, I believe, I believe
