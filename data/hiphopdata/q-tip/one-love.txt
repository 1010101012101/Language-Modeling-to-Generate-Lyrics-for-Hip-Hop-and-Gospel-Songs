What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid 
 When the cops came you should of slid to my crib 
 Fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done 
 Plus congratulations you know you got a son 
 I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you? 
 Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper 
 Flip it, talk about he acts too rough 
 He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff 
 I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too 
 Fucking with the niggas from that fake crew that hate you 
 But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece? 
 Jerome s niece, on her way home from joes beaches club 
 Plus little rob is selling drugs all the time 
 Hanging out with young thugs that all carry 9's 
 At night time there's more trife than ever 
 What up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together? 
 If so then hold the fort, now I represent to the fullest 
 Say what's up to herb, ice and bullet 
 I left a half a hundred in your commissary 
 You was my nigga when push came to shove 
 One what? one love 
 Dear born, you'll be out soon, stay strong 
 Out in new york the same shit is going on 
 The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking 
 Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking 
 The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' something 
 Word to mother, I heard him fronting 
 And he be pumping on your block 
 Your man gave him your glock 
 And now they run together, what up son, whatever 
 Since I'm on the streets I'm a put it to a cease 
 When I heard you blew a nigga with the ? for a phone piece 
 Whylin' on the island but now with? 
 Better chill 'cause them niggasz will put that ass on fire 
 Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers 
 I maintain when you come home the corner's ours 
 On the reels, all these crab niggaz know the deal 
 When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal 
 But chill, see you on the next v I 
 I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks 
 Plus ? flicks 
 Your brother's buck whylin' in four Maine he wrote me 
 He might beat his case, till he come home I play it low key 
 So stay civilized, time flies 
 Though incarcerated your mind (dies) 
 I hate it when your mum cries 
 It kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a 
 I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs 
 For one love 
 Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack 
 Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts 
 Written in school text books, bibles, etcetera 
 Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er 
 So I be ghost from my projects 
 I take my pen and pad for the week and hittin' nails while I'm sleeping 
 A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone 
 To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home 
 You see the streets have me stressed something terrible 
 Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in belle vue 
 Or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10 
 A future in a maximum state pen is grim 
 So I comes back home, nobody's helping shorty 
 Do I roll them two phillies together and the friends we call them oowops 
 He said nas, niggaz cold be bustin' off the roof 
 So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce 
 He inhailed so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep 
 Started coughing when I peeked to watch me speak 
 I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black 
 We was chillin' on these bitches where he pumped his loose cracks 
 I took an l when he passed it, this little bastard 
 Keeps me blasted he starts talking mad shit 
 I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him 
 'Cause when the pistol blows a shot that's when a murder be the cool one 
 Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up 
 Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up 
 Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up 
 If the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed 
 Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul 
 Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style 
 Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes 
 Then froze only the bolder herb smoke through my nose 
 And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose 
 There's some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose 
 Words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above 
 Keep an eye out for jake shorty what 
 One love
