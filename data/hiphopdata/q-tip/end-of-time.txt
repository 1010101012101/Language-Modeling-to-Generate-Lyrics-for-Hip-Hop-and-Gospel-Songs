(Feat. Korn) 
 Q-Tip: 
 Just feelin' things out for real, ya know? 
 Just wanna do me for real, ya know? 
 No reason to make it complicated, you feelin' agitated, 
 You love it or you hate itâ€¦fuck it 
 Desperation, jumpin' off of street corners here 
 Hustlahz lookin' for buzz like "pop one in here" 
 Local state officialsâ€¦.yeah they out of touch 
 Getting money for some, aiyo, ain't nothin' much 
 But yoâ€¦let them tell it, we smoke it and we sell it 
 You don't understand, so don't tell it 
 You sneakin' souls just for phat diamond golds 
 'Cause our lady friends have likings for designer clothes 
 People in my hood thinkâ€¦.if I'm lookin' raggedy, then the cat is just a weak 
 Link 
 In the very fake chain of oppressionâ€¦.if television taught me any lesson, it's 
 "Image is Nothing", but yo I got a thirstâ€¦Nothing, but yo I got a thirst 
 Nothing, but yo I got a thirstâ€¦what's first? Your rings or your purse? 
 Jonathan Davis (KoRn): 
 (Oh boyâ€¦oh boy! Make your wagers back there! Step livelyâ€¦women and 
 Children first! The world is coming to an end! Come on nowâ€¦we're looking at 
 The end! We have to leave themâ€¦we have to leave all our paraphanelias 
 Behindâ€¦.{brought backâ€¦brought backâ€¦.[repeated]} LET'S GOOOOO!) 
 It's kinda scary you seeâ€¦. 
 How fucked up things can be 
 Each time you take a bath 
 How it could have been your last 
 There's so much shit around us 
 Things we can't even see 
 Is this the end of our line? 
 That's where I wanna beâ€¦.that's where I wanna be 
 That's where I want to beâ€¦.that's where-I want-to be 
 (End of Time)-repeated
