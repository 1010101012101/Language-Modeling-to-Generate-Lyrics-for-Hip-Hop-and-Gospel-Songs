Fly love 
 Say what [Repeat: x6] 
 (Common) 
 I don't stress it baby 
 They say you got me dressing crazy 
 Eating veggies when serve sex the medium 
 And if we break up 
 Imam eat meat again 
 I feel complete with you 
 Shit, I held up size up the street for you 
 In the street people ask about me and you 
 I tell them we go through what most people do 
 Yes, let go of fear love 
 We can grow as long as my beard does 
 You push me way in the way you supposed to 
 Queen you're the one I come close to 
 Come close to me 
 Come close baby 
 Come close ma' 
 Baby baby 
 Let me hold you love 
 Come closer love 
 I know this world gets 
 It gets crazy baby 
 It gets crazy girl 
 But what's it without you you you you 
 (Pharell) 
 I know you used to watch me 
 Rock Gucci and Versace 
 But now I'm back to my skater roots 
 Still got friends in them gator boots 
 What's up with them hater dudes? 
 Ma' hating is OK with you? 
 Why, 'cause they drive in them fancy cars 
 Look, I could ride you on my handle bars 
 Of my BMX baby 
 I'm creative with turrets baby 
 My testicles filled with ecstasy 
 When I think of you naked please 
 (Erykah Badu) 
 I know your thinking 
 You're on my mind 
 Your right, your right, your right 
 You promise so fast you just might take flight 
 Open up time 
 Tonight, Tonight 
 (Q- Tip) 
 I don't stress it girl 
 They say you and I are from different worlds 
 You from underneath the underground 
 Where I understood my hip hop 
 One two this disposition 
 I don't stress it sweetie 
 You write in cursive I write in graffiti 
 Opposite not really we just customized through our turfs 
 Hey I'm expecting you listen 
 I'm saying a rat's ass I couldn't give 
 Even thought you far away in my heart you live 
 So bring your sweet face closer to me 
 And look into my eyes and tell me what you see 
 Fly love
