This is life in this world 
 Some things go right, some things go wrong 
 It's just how the world can be 
 People just wanna be free 
 Yeah 
 The verdict came in and it said I was guilty 
 I looked at the judge, "Hey, America built me" 
 Tried to get rich, but they label me filthy 
 Only God can judge me, touch me, feel me! 
 My friend calls me at nine o'clock 
 Says, "Get the car, it's time to rock." 
 Never heard him speak this way 
 (Way, way) 
 Let's go man 
 I grab the keys and hit the road 
 It's all a flash, but who would know 
 How this story would unfold 
 Don't charge me for the crime 
 Wrong place, wrong time 
 Don't charge me for the crime 
 Wrong place, wrong time 
 Don't charge me for the crime 
 My friend gets in the car with bags 
 Filled to the top with loads of cash 
 (See this paper right here?) 
 And throws the pistol on the dash 
 (Yeah, it's time to get money now) 
 Says, "I'm sorry for the crime 
 That I've involved you in this time, 
 You're the only friend I've got" 
 So don't charge me for the crime 
 Wrong place, wrong time 
 Don't charge me for the crime 
 Wrong place, wrong time 
 Don't charge me for the crime 
 I start to freak and scream so loud 
 Just like the females in the crowd 
 That's when he gets in my head 
 (Head, head) 
 (Come on man, we gotta do this) 
 You could live just like a king 
 With everything you'd ever need 
 All the dreams of every man 
 Don't charge me for the crime 
 Wrong place, wrong time 
 Don't charge me for the crime 
 Wrong place, wrong time, you know 
 Don't charge me 
 Sirens sound and 
 My heart was poundin' 
 I looked at my man as the cops surround 'em 
 A teen on the scene with no objective 
 The American dream can be so deceptive 
 Now I see the flashing lights 
 There goes my future and my life 
 Now I've gotta do what's right 
 (Right, right) 
 (Oh, man, they've got us, they've got us) 
 I stop the car and throw the keys 
 Out of the window, sets me free 
 I throw the pistol in the back 
 (Back, back) 
 (Ah, ah, ah) 
 I throw him out of the car, I say, 
 "You know me well, 
 I'm not goin' to jail 
 I'm not paying your bail 
 Believe me when I say, 
 They won't charge me for the crime" 
 Wrong place, wrong time (yeah) 
 Don't charge me for the crime 
 Wrong place, wrong time 
 Won't charge me! Oh 
 Wrong place, 
 Wrong time 
 Wrong place, 
 Wrong time 
 They won't charge me for the 
 Crime
