Oh, yeah - Well the bell has rung because the time is here 
 Oh, yeah - We gotta switch it around and put the thang in gear 
 Oh, yeah - Not much is for sure, but this here is true 
 Oh, yeah - I gotta do it for me, but then I'll do it for you 
 Major attraction, trouble distraction 
 Scramble up my name and it still come action 
 Music's our number, dial to sue slumber 
 Open up your ears to the low tint of thunder 
 Creative Queens native, mixes are the Native 
 Want some fresh shit? Then we're correlative 
 Busta is ferocious, unflawed and precocious 
 Airin fools out 'cause my willy bodacious 
 Peoples don't blame me, shorties can't game me 
 Country Cherokee but the city here made me 
 Rock like coral, distinctive 'bout my orals 
 Got lil' grime and got lotta laurels 
 The rhythm stay bangin', my one-two thangin 
 Is exemplified by the comp left hangin' 
 Percussion's our weapons, drums are Smith and Wesson's 
 Lyrics poppin' off leaving deep impressions 
 (DJ scratches up "Ooh, it's time") 
 Oh, yeah - Well the bell has rung because the time is here 
 Oh, yeah - We gotta switch it around and put the thang in gear 
 Oh, yeah - Not much is for sure, but this here is true 
 Oh, yeah - I gotta do it for me, but then I'll do it for you 
 Yo, I feel what the beat does, people fuck with me 'cause 
 When the song end, I become what the beat was 
 Same thing as other, no need for cookie cutter 
 The bar gets raised, not your average old gutter 
 For that I hit a chin up, B, ya time been up 
 Would've came sooner but I overslept my get-up 
 Now let's get in the middle, girl I'll solve your riddle 
 'Cause we can be strong and protect against the brittle 
 If groupies need to see me, go and get the CD 
 I aerosol you all top to bottom like graffiti 
 Biz {? } lot and, dudes say I'm pardon 
 When you hear the music, thus begins the Mardi Gras and 
 Rhymes ain't the issue, that's how I'm gon' get you 
 Don't need a Billboard hit for me to +hit+ you 
 The clairvoyant micist, who ALWAYS come the tightest 
 Queens everywhere demostratin who the flyest 
 Oh, yeah - Well the bell has rung because the time is here 
 Mmm, mmm - We gotta change it around and put our thang in gear 
 Oh, yeah - Not much is for sure, but this thang is true 
 Mmm, mmm - Gotta do it for me and then I'll do it for you 
 Oh - Oh, gotta do it for me and then I'll do it for you 
 Oh - Yeah, gotta do it for me and then I'll do it for you 
 Oh...
