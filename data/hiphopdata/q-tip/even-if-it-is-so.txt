She work at Mickey D's from 9 to 5, Walmart 6 to 10 
 Saving up enough for school, her little girl is doing well 
 Daddy is a walking bum, smoking weed, drinking rum 
 Couldn't leave her if I tried, I see her light is on inside 
 Let's build 
 She's in the back room, greasing up, Friday night is heating up 
 Young cats tricking up, dancing so they give it up 
 The best girl working there and you know for what it's worth 
 She's working towards a better life, regardless if she's working nights 
 Let's build 
 And the people go 
 Bom-bom-de-bom-de-bom-bom 
 Bom-bom-de-bom-de-bom-bom 
 Bom-bom-de-bom-de-bom-bom 
 Bom-bom-de-bom-de-bom-bom 
 And even if she is 
 I dig her so 
 De-bom-bom-de-bom-de-bom-bom 
 De-bom-bom-de-bom-de-bom-bom 
 De-bom-bom-de-bom-de-bom-bom 
 De-bom-bom-de-bom-de-bom-bom

 I'm just an arty music gigolo, life goes on without me though 
 If you have some pay for me, I will come and play for thee 
 As long as I know she's there, I don't even really care 
 Cause even though our lives ain't right, I still see that better life
