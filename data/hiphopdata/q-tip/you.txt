Wait 
 It's you 
 And at the end of it all it's you 
 And at the end 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all it's you 
 It's you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all it's you 
 It's you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all 
 Lookin' for how I see her 
 When I finally realized couldn't believe it 
 I couldn't, even swallow 
 Had a lump in my throat my stomach hollow 
 I had a notion that things were fishy 
 But everything was fine so I'd be pissy 
 But when you wasn't seeing me nights you get in 
 That's when the snoopin and shit it would begin 
 Where you at? 
 Where you going? 
 That's what I get when I pick up the phone 
 Not a hello or I miss you 
 Or the renaissnace how does it do? 
 Suspicious ones go few 
 Can stress out your brain 
 In weighs on your mane 
 And helps you peep game I thought it was me 
 But then I could it see 
 It was you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all it was you 
 And at the end 
 It was you 
 At the end of it all it was you 
 And at the end 
 It's you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all it's you 
 It's you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all 
 I couldn't take it 
 But the spell of love 
 I couldn't shake it 
 Even though I would discover 
 That there was somebody else 
 It was your lover 
 You gave me up 
 And managed to turn the tables 
 And all your honest words they turn to fables 
 The things that you would accuse me of 
 It seem were the things you were doin' love 
 Get it? these things you projected 
 And I don't want to be affected 
 But when you get in love 
 It's never easy love 
 To make decisions of 
 You've defected 
 You were doin' so much to try to pin me 
 Goin' through all my stuff but it was empty 
 Answers, that I'm seekin' 
 Well it seem I'm gettin' close 
 That I'm reachin' 
 And I was thinkin' I had no reason 
 Callin you a culprit it was treason 
 And the twinkle in your eye 
 It was kinda not for love 
 And tell me why? 
 We'll make a mends if you admit it 
 We can ascend if your committed 
 Your heart, is it in it? 
 If it goes for many days 
 Sweet love can decay from you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all it was you 
 And at the end 
 It was you 
 At the end of it all it was you 
 And the end 
 It's you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all it's you 
 It's you 
 It's you 
 At the end of it all
