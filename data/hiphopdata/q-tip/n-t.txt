(Q-Tip) 
 For real though who really got sick though 
 On the edge got the ledge hangin' out of the window 
 Bird chest niggas witcha winderous fearaf 
 Fuck around you'll be against me the size of a meal sack 
 Cutie little bucks better hit the jake 
 But that doesn't mean nothin' to the heart within 
 You cramped up you and your team I'm amped up 
 And you asses can't dip my B 
 My shine what the fuck is on your mind? 
 Little weaklink rappers better hit the grind 
 Other brothers ain't motivated they can't do it 
 Not only the opposite train it I ran through it 
 My music comes on and we march at the dance 
 Inside of your mind or inside of my pants? 
 Use a cruel intention that we have is bad 
 You sick? Drink a NyQuil when I'm bed on your ass 
 Oh well then here comes the gellatiin 
 Tips on some sugars but you yap on your sellin' friends 
 Now your party is completely blown 
 Real name is Kamal I'll make him peep his own 
 It's rap time for you that means nap time 
 Preachin from my joint what the fuck I'ma clap mine 
 Singin' songs in 6 pens with sit tensed 
 Surpised your ass is the end like the sixth sense 
 Heavy hitters knockin' shit out the park 
 You didn't even really play tell me why did you start 
 Spittin' sharp blades lakes with bleach 
 You wanna play around kid I'm not a walk at the beach 
 A stroll in the park or your fuckin' playground 
 Put on your headphones and tell me how granades sound 
 Put on your walkmase and go underneath the town 
 Q-Tip abstract how I gets down 
 Chorus: [Busta Rhymes] 
 All my bitches, dance if you know that you dam sure 
 Let your pussy drip on the dance floor if you wanna 
 (Q-Tip) 
 Get down

 Better lit a make for their rush that 'cause they wanna

 (Busta Rhymes) 
 While I'm on the hook get on your good foot 
 And blow up the spot for all of you niggas 'cause that's how we 
 (Q-Tip) 
 Get down 
 (Q-Tip) 
 Comin' with the brand new quickly we pant to 
 The young black man with intentions to band you 
 See that people need a age in things 
 So many paid their ways so many phean to stay 
 I really rhyme 'cause I feel I should say things 
 By the fortualte act rap just so they cop rings 
 Or maybe because when they was young 
 They was fronted on a life alone that have their own fun 
 Now their all grown up to be assholes 
 I'm giving you the rope will you tie talassels? 
 You swing dingaling for peas trees 
 While I sip my Dacarees in the south west breeze 
 Writings so exciting the pen it keeps 
 Drippin out jings that's converted to hems and them 
 People be hummin in formality next to kin 
 My family is starvin? You know they want me to win 
 We forfeit nigga please get off it 
 Second checkin' my name to my office 
 Mutombo in the lane yo I toss it 
 Abstract comin' through witness abortion
