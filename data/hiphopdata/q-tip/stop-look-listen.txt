I'm the river that flow to the hood, 
 To the woods, to the birds, to the mud, 
 To the bricks over the curves, 
 To the forced bizarre got with 4 acres 
 And force with words, 
 Planted chrome for the young seeds to know, trees is blowing 
 We see change in the wind 
 This is new day and I gotta take it in, see a black man hero 
 We need him to win 
 Young eyes search search for a better tomorrow, 
 Let the belief lead the way and the angles halo, 
 Open doors for a hope for to go through, 
 'Cause I would chose see and I'm supposed to. 
 I know that change come come 
 The race begun, we're almost there oh yeah 
 I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child, I always smile, 
 Let my mind float like child. 
 Wishing I was smart as these kids are now, 
 All grown ups still wishing I'm a child again. 
 Church saw remind me to stay grateful, a more ? remind me to stay playful, 
 Day's go by, my life all high 
 I leave all my walks so the fight don't die, and me 
 I found the purpose why I'm MC 
 Inspire a young world to be greated than me. 
 I fall awake and a dream a song, 
 So the little shorty's could sing along. 
 Welcome children, welcome me 
 Your sentimences felt in me, 
 I see the future and the walk your path, don't let these fools take you off your path. 
 Laugh if you need to, smile if you need to, 
 Life is a trip while a long and proceed to, 
 Try to believe to, do what you wanna do, remember you kings and queens are still humble to, 
 Life is a bitch now need to look back again, 
 Victory can be claim while you still battling, 
 Drive along with the food I provided you, 
 To awaking the boy's that is inside you. 
 Change is avreble, you can't stop it, changes happening and 
 Everybody is like. 
 Changes is like a furious hurricane that you can't stop 
 What is change? change is Marin Luther King Jr., Gandhi, 
 Shakespeare, Tupac Shakur, Barack Obama, 
 And you can't forget Common, 
 Changes gonna happen, change is hope.
