Now that I know what is boy 
 For your epitaph niggers 
 Laugh, tricks that he gassed your ass 
 Siphon and not your cash 
 Seeing the door in a flash 
 While I stay enclosed 
 Walkin' out my clothes she said, 
 I was waitin for nothing 
 You're mother fucking right 
 Walking this shit every night 
 Fin this shit? Hold it tight 
 Rina filma on my sleeve? 
 Even when I have to leave 
 Cooler than even in the breeze 
 Do you believe 
 I was waiting for nothin' 
 The one division leader 
 In the rebound new group of shorties 
 Off the post, goin' coast to coast 
 She on the hard ones, sub him out the game she sayin' 
 "Naw, he good, I mean" 
 I was waitin for nothing 
 For no amount of dough 
 Franchise this man 
 Give him all the things you can 
 Think long term plans even bringin' in the fans 
 Front page magazine, listen to this lady scream 
 I was waitin' for nothing 
 'Cause she know what's better her top and 
 Now a beckon on the flu 
 Like a runnin' with the nicest nigger 
 Kinda sorta? 
 When he's singing just to slaughter no matter the quarter 
 I was waitin' for nothing 
 The club house king 
 Batting practice Slugger swing, 
 Game time same thing 
 When I'm in about a minute 
 Holdin' the bat, as good as fat 
 She's out the park and comin' back she's saying 
 I was waitin for nothing 
 And for ray you say you get it good 
 If you were the ball player at all 
 And the famous fall inevitably will make a call 
 Hangin' memorabilia from you walls 
 This is why you can't trade me 
 I was waitin for nothing 
 Now that I know what is boy 
 You can bet your money on a sure thing 
 Certain profit's what it brings 
 Ceremonies of the ringer in the white house wing 
 Clear your mantle, the trophies I bring, do you wanna trade? 
 I was waitin for nothing 
 'Cause in the air? there's a teammate you're lookin' for 
 Back-shoot and aughter ball? 
 Leaves it all on the floor 
 Always lookin' to score 
 Pep talks in the locker room 
 This is why you sing this tune 
 I was waitin for nothing 
 And then you reach Can't make me sit out 
 I go till you get out 
 Her ball no get out 
 An all night get-down 
 I train for the pressure 
 They come all-thresha 
 Equipped for the game 
 You know my name, it makes me better 
 I cheer for the whole team 
 Let's go for the whole thing 
 The ballads that you're holding 
 And repeat whole thing 
 And I represent the sentiment yeah allo team 
 And you say 
 I was waitin for nothing 
 The physical ability with mental capability 
 Legitimately faces me aside of your vicinity 
 And I ain't really seein' me 
 Vacating this community I'm staying in 
 I was waitin for nothing 
 I'm glad that you feel this way, 
 Here is where I like to play 
 Need to hear it everyday 
 They cheer for me, say "Olay! " 
 Wait a minute, "Andale? " 
 I don't know, well anyway...
