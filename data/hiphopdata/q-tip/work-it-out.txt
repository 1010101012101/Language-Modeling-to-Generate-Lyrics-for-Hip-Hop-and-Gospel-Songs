 Borin', well, my life used to be 
 'Til I tapped the MPC to conduct the such 
 Breakin', that's what you gonna do 
 That means I break through 'cause you're clearly touched 
 Bear meet Chris Kurt is on the scene 
 The hot faces him, the jumps is [unverified] 
 Breakout ever then mixes are grow 
 Breaks are out from every show 'cause this shit never heard 
 Hip-hop is that what said is wack? 
 We need to bring it back and la, di, da, da 
 Music, is supplement the worst? 
 And known to touch your nerves, so here's another bar 
 Passion, the passion of the Mix 
 To passion of the nights were ever, let it be 
 Hold up, no need to be excited [unverified] 
 Just let the [unverified] ride, come on and let's be free 
 Work it out 
 We gets it in 
 Now wait and if you could, would you please? 
 How many ill MC's are capturing the mass? 
 One hits, they do the little do 
 But just a day or two but then they never last. 
 Ring tones, the Labels cashin' in 
 They think they gonna win of this phenomenon 
 Thinkin', I'm thinkin' out to me 
 But the music carry me, let the music carry you 
 Work it out 
 We gets it in
