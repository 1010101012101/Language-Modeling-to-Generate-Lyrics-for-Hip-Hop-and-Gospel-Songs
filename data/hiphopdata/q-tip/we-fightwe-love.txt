And it, and it begins, he walks outside for a cigarette break 
 And thinks how many cigarettes does it take 
 He takes a long drag with the sun in his eye 
 He squints, he thinks, he starts to sigh 
 Sometimes he cry 
 When he think about his girlfriend on his side 
 She held him down, she made him better 
 Fought the love through the fucked up weather 
 And she thinking about her life 
 With no more work, just being a wife 
 But instead her love she gave it to a man 
 Who fought against her lovely plans 
 So when she go to work plus go to school 
 Plus fight the love she must feel like a fool 
 She want the ease that come after pain 
 She fights for love, that's her campaign 
 We fight, we love 
 We fight and love so much 
 Sometimes I get confused of who we are 
 Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit 
 We'll find out who we are 
 We fight and love so much 
 Sometimes I get confused of who we are 
 Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit 
 We'll find out who we are 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit more 
 We just keep on 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit more 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit more 
 We just keep on 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit more 
 And it, and it begins, he's off the ball 
 He left his friends, he ain't home no more 
 He's in a place that's far away 
 Where he can't understand what they say 
 They say salaam, they carry bombs 
 Into crowded places and cause alarm 
 You're the infidel who's uninvited 
 But really an American boy who's slighted 
 It ain't your fault, you want identity 
 So you join this big fraternity 
 You get to travel the world, it's cheaper than college 
 And you get guns and you get knowledge 
 Looking for your soul and WMD's 
 You can't find nothing 'cause it's empty 
 You got your gun and he's your friend 
 And he's your man until the end 
 We fight, we love 
 We fight and love so much 
 Sometimes I get confused of who we are 
 Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit 
 We'll find out who we are 
 We fight and love so much 
 Sometimes I get confused of who we are 
 Maybe if we just stop and chat a bit 
 We'll find out who we are 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit more 
 We just keep on 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit more 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit more 
 We just keep on 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit more 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit more 
 We just keep on 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit more 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit 
 Fighting just a little bit 
 Loving just a little bit more
