(Feat. 2Pac) 
 (Q-Tip) 
 One two... 
 Dedicated, dedicated... 
 Yo I remember, it musta been about, ninety-one, ninety-two 
 Somethin' like that... 
 We had did a show, in San Fran', and 'Pac ran up on stage with us 
 We was doin' "Check the Rhime" 
 And after he got up with us, went to the back 
 And he asked me if I saw "Juice" - figure it just came out 
 I remember givin' him love 
 We always had that respect for each other heh, y'knahmsayin? 
 I guess uh... we was enjoined kinda on the same path of truth 
 Or whatever whatever 
 But he still here though 
 I know uhm ah ah ah ah ah I know it, y'knahmsayin? 
 I feel him right here 
 Yeah, I just feel him right here 
 Hah, hmm, I just feel him right here 
 Huh, I'ma take my time, I'ma do this joint 
 Ha ha ha, ha ha 
 The fear, in the heart, of a man 
 Dedicated to my heart, my ha-ha-heart 
 The fear, in the heart, of a man 
 Dedicated to my heart... 
 Against an attacker, I will boldly take my stand 
 Because my heart will show, fear for no man 
 Before a broken heart, I run with fright 
 Scared to be blind in the vulnerable night 
 Uh, I believe this fear is in every man 
 Some will acknowledge it, others will fail to understand 
 Uh uh uh uh, there's no fear in a shallow heart 
 Because the shallow heart is faint and don't fall apart 
 Because the shallow heart is faint don't fall apart 
 But feeling hearts that truly care 
 Are fragile to the flow of air 
 And if I am to be true then I must give... my fragile heart 
 My fragile heart 
 I may re-ceive-great-joy 
 Or you may re-turn it, say it again 
 I may re-ceive-great-joy-or you may re-turn it, ripped apart, hah 
 Ripped apart... ripped apart... 
 Ripped apart nothing left... ripped apart
