My brother Shaka would have wanted me to do it like this 
 So raise the glasses for all the lost ones in your life 
 Dilla dawg and master wow, what up with Emmy 
 Is well to propel with the spirit of the mic 
 Even if you have one person with you when it's hard 
 That makes it easy, celebrate them let know just who they are 
 Because of these experiences, I have some control 
 On the microphone and roll elevating to the stars 
 Her's a demonstration, with the excellence 
 Reverse the pandemic that's filled with pestilence 
 Who has his finger on the post of the b-boy 
 Serving fees with the stream of a deep boy 
 Who's well connected, you must respect it 
 I'm dippin' with the spirits mentioned on this record 
 Hopefully this serves as motivation 
 The never sayin' docon-sensation 
 Put my stamp on it, the mic clamps on it 
 Mama I know let me put little thamp on it 
 Blade running through the day of agility 
 Staying gunning make way for possibilities 
 It's the capital Q, rap it'll do 
 What I want it to, it's like taming a shrew 
 Living life experiencing proportions 
 Knowing better, I've experienced distortions 
 And through the in and outs, of life's revolving doors 
 I'mma see that, I'm still getting more 
 Yeah, I'm comin' in, I'm gonna see my friend 
 To the top floor, seems it never ends 
 Heaven never ends, yeah, it never ends 
 It be goin' on, it's phenomenon, like a new born 
 Or a Stevie song, it be going on 
 Do ya fell it, do ya feel it, do ya feel it? 
 Do ya feel it, do ya feel it 
 Snare drum goes 
 My brother Shaka would have wanted me to say this to y'all 
 Don't lose sight y'all without giving a fight 
 I'm channeling well and Irvine, Mr. clean 
 He would have wanted me to say what I mean 
 And mean get it right 
 Dilla having you in my past has been a blast 
 You've inspired so many and forever will you last 
 And to my father yo your spirit is draping me 
 Never escapin' me, I'm happy that I had you in my past 
 Let's go 
 (Let's go) 
 Let's go 
 (Let's go) 
 Let's go 
 (Let's go)
