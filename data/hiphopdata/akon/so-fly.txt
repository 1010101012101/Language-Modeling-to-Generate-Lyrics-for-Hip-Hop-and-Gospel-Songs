(Akon talkin') 
 Count every blessin while I'm scream'n out 
 Up front (up front) 
 Akon (Akon) 
 Convict music (music) 
 (Akon - chorus) 
 (Yaaaaa...) 
 Realize'n this ain't the life for me 
 Always gettin' into trouble cause, I'm so fly 
 I'm on a whole notha level 
 I left the block but now I'm smilein, countin' money like (yaaaaa...) 
 Realize'n this ain't the life for me 
 I don found anotha hustle cause, I'm so fly 
 I'm livin' life alot betta 
 So get these people locked up, incase the jealous want to hate tonight 
 (Akon) 
 Anotha day up in the hood, can't believe these cats still bang'n 
 Look at the years we've wasted, on the corna block still slang'n 
 No matta how hard we try to make peace, gun shots still rain'n 
 Cause to become a hood legand, you gata learn how to become famous 
 'Cause I don seen this typea thing before 
 Just hang'n out by the corna store 
 Stick up kids wit them gunz galore 
 Layin everybody down streched on the floor 
 I thought about it man but I'm way to fly 
 To have a fella robb'n me outside 
 That's why I keep that thing my side 
 Count every blessin while I'm screamin out 
 (Akon - chorus) 
 (Yaaaaa...) 
 Realize'n this ain't the life for me 
 Always gettin' into trouble cause, I'm so fly 
 I'm on a whole notha level

 Realize'n this ain't the life for me 
 I don found anotha hustle cause, I'm so fly

 (Akon) 
 I hate to say it, but the people that surround'n me are way to shady 
 The only people I can trust, is my family and my lady 
 All my dawgz got gunz ready for action 
 They wont betray me 
 If the type to run, gotta hold my tougne 
 When it gets crazy 
 See, I've been threw this type of thing before 
 Even had trouble wit the law 
 On the couch when they smashed my door 
 With tha warrant, found the cash stashed under the floor 
 I could never understand the cause 
 I was the one to pull the shortest straw 
 Couldn't live this typea life no more 
 So I hada block it and I started screamin out 
 (Akon - chorus) 
 (Yaaaaa...) 
 Realize'n this ain't the life for me 
 Always gettin' into trouble cause, I'm so fly 
 I'm on a whole notha level 
 I left the block but now I'm smilein, countin' money like (yaaaaa...) 
 Realize'n this ain't the life for me 
 I don found anotha hustle cause, I'm so fly

 (Blewz) 
 I'm in blue wit them BF frames 
 Walkin' on lean while my chain hangs 
 Drivin' somethin', but now its mad strange 
 Yeah I'm mad cool, 'cause I've been through flames 
 Walk wit a limp, 'cause I've been through games 
 Now she's a hoe 'cause she's been through gangs 
 I beef wit cats, for a small chump change 
 I'm rich now, 'cause I jumped a chump wit a small amount of change 
 The cops no slang 
 Man get the picture, before you buy the frame 
 Call me heart throbb, 'cause I'm so fame 
 Couldn't come closer if you sat in my range 
 My paws can prove it, 'cause I'm passion in pain sayin'... 
 (Akon - chorus) 
 (Yaaaaa...)
