 Upfront 
 Gotta get my block sold up... u know me 
 Gotta get my block sold up... u know me 
 E'yo gringo e'yo gringo 
 I heard you wan some marijuana 
 Or some pure white coca 
 E'yo gringo e'yo gringo 
 See I never been a smoker 
 I'm just ur neighborhood dealer 
 And I'm tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 See I woke up early as hell one morning 
 And I noticed my stash was half gone 
 'Cause these feen's can't stop smokin' ma rocks 
 'Cause around my way these nigga's been worry 
 Fighting for territory that's mine 
 'Cause these cats can't stop live 'cause of my shots 
 I'ma show you right now I'm reason the block is moving 
 I got dubs at the price of a dime 
 That's why I'm on top and I won't stop 
 'Cause I get it so cheap no matter what I won't be losing 
 Re-up spots is so hard to find 
 But I got one 
 Cool ass Mexican man 
 E'yo gringo e'yo gringo 
 I heard you wan some marijuana 
 Or some pure white coca 
 E'yo gringo e'yo gringo 
 See I never been a smoker 
 I'm just ur neighborhood dealer 
 And I'm tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 You can find me on the other side of the border 
 Where the 100 grand in my pocket 
 For the first trip jus' pack a lil somethin' 
 'Cause I'ma bring the work back by the air 
 Or even by water 
 Whatever it take to get to the crib 
 Gotta play it safe 'cause they out there 
 See I got so much client ale waiting 
 I can't just make one trip 
 But I gotta get enough to supply the sibling 
 But I gotta be careful smugglin' in 
 Vaseline rapped around so it hide the sent 
 While I wait Jose 
 He'll bring it to me 
 E'yo gringo e'yo gringo 
 I heard you wan some marijuana 
 Or some pure white coca 
 E'yo gringo e'yo gringo 
 See I never been a smoker 
 I'm just ur neighborhood dealer 
 And I'm tryin' to keep my block soad up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 Tryin' to keep my block sold up... 
 'Cause I'm a Konvict 
 Eh... 
 Ever gonna be a Konvict 
 'Cause I'm a Konvict 
 Eh...
