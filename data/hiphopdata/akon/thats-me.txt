That's me on the corner 
 That's me on the track, Strapped 
 Weed stashed next to my burger 
 Can you believe, that these jealous niggas turned in formerrrr? 
 They even tryin' to murderrrr, 'cause we made too much. 
 So go run up on these choppas, 'Cause we ain't gon love. 
 Yeah, the dope game, I ain't never been a stranger to, and I can make the work dropp like a kangaroo 
 I whip 56 and turn it into a 92, cusss got me walkin' wit that backpack in 92. 
 I'm focused nigga, my swagger to the rooftop, hit a button now ya bitch draggin outta rooftop! 
 Ride like 2-Pac, just bought a new glock with 32 shots, Nigga, That's me. 
 (Chorus 1: Akon) 
 That's me on the corner 
 That's me on the track, Strapped 
 Weed stashed next to my burger 
 Can you believe, that these jealous niggas turned in formerrrr, 
 They even tryin' to murderrrr, 'cause weee madee too much. 
 So go run up on these choppas, 'Cause we ainttt gon loveee. 
 I know, these bitch niggas wanna git me, that's why Lucifer laughin' in my hemi, automatic semi, black on black hemi gangsta shit in me!Came from up in here! Waatch out, tell ya mouth ridin' feature sam! Imma go plus I can shoot with either hand! clutch-ridergized, Kill with a lethal plan! Who is that, why that's...[akon continues to chorus 1]
