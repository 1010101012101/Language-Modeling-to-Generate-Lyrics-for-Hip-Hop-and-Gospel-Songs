The way that you walking, the way that you talking 
 You're the one I want to spend this night with 
 Trying to get in them drawers and bang it out till the morning 
 I can already tell you want it 
 Cause you shaking it all for me, giving it all to me 
 Rubbing that body on me 
 Keep on shaking it all for me, giving it all to me 
 Rubbing that body on me 
 Hey boy 
 I think I just might wanna come see you tonight 
 And you can have your way boy 
 I know it's been a while since you made my body right 
 Now I've been waiting patiently, anticipating you and me 
 And it ain't no question cause boy I love you when you put that body on me 
 Hey how you doing mama

 I wanna make you someone more then just a a bone in my closet 
 I wanna win that type of relationship 
 Where you gon' wanna come hang when your man done trip 
 You say your short this month and you're late on your rent 
 He took your car, what you mean? Hold this

 And I ain't tryna be the other chick (I know you want it)
