(Feat. E-40) 
 (Chorus - Akon) 
 Konvict 
 Akon! and E-40... Yeah... 
 I know you ain't used to havin' 
 Real niggas around like me around 
 I'm here to change 
 To your whole life girl, 
 So you don't deal with clowns 
 And treat you 
 Like a superstar that you are 
 Casue I'm a superstar too 
 And I know exactly 
 What I must do to make you... 
 Feel! I'm about to wake it up! 
 Feel! See I'm about to wake it up! 
 Feel! I'm about to wake it up! 
 Don't It feel so good girl 
 Feel! I'm about to wake it up! 
 Feel! See I'm about to wake it up! 
 Feel! I'm about to wake it up! 
 Don't It feel so good girl 
 (Verse One - E-40) 
 I keep it 100's, 
 Don't carry nothing but 100's 
 I'm trying to wake it up, 
 I'm on your line like Vonage 
 I'm a real one, Ma! 
 Get rid of that clown, 
 Get with a factor 
 Patna don't count, 
 He a lame he don't matter 
 Shining like a big dipper, 
 Glowing like a star 
 Lookin' up a paw, 
 Pullin up in my car 
 Walked right up to the front 
 Where the bosses park at 
 I got a cold mouth piece 
 Can talk a chick out her check 
 Security loves me, 
 Let me in with no sweat 
 I see asian persuasion, 
 Aaucasian, 
 All kinds of chicks 
 Milk skin, chocolate boned, 
 Lambs and Haitians 
 Tryna take me something home 
 And have some relation 
 (Chorus - Akon) 
 I know you ain't used to havin' 
 Real niggas around like me around 
 I'm here to change 
 To your whole life girl, 
 So you don't deal with clowns 
 And treat you 
 Like a superstar that you are 
 Casue I'm a superstar too 
 And I know exactly 
 What I must do to make you... 
 Feel! I'm about to wake it up! 
 Feel! See I'm about to wake it up! 
 Feel! I'm about to wake it up! 
 Don't It feel so good girl 
 Feel! I'm about to wake it up! 
 Feel! See I'm about to wake it up! 
 Feel! I'm about to wake it up! 
 Don't It feel so good girl 
 (Verse Two - E-40) 
 Good God Almighty! Look at that body 
 What you holdin'? Girl you a banger! 
 You ain't off the back porch, 
 You're off the HANGER! 
 You working with something, 
 You gotta personal trainer? 
 Whole crew fine but you're one of a kind 
 You a ten piece, shawty you a dime 
 Back that thang up, baby press rewind 
 Imma Scorpio, Shawty what's your sign? 
 I'm just tryna know you, hold a conversation 
 Spoil you a lil', lightweight cupcakin' 
 Spend a lil gouda, get your hair done up 
 Imma show you how a tycoon wake that thang up 
 (Chorus - Akon) 
 I know you ain't used to havin' 
 Real niggas around like me around 
 I'm here to change 
 To change your whole life girl, 
 So you don't deal with clowns 
 And treat you 
 Like a superstar that you are 
 Casue I'm a superstar too 
 And I know exactly 
 What I must do to make you... 
 Feel! I'm about to wake it up! 
 Feel! See I'm about to wake it up! 
 Feel! I'm about to wake it up! 
 Don't It feel so good girl 
 Feel! I'm about to wake it up! 
 Feel! See I'm about to wake it up! 
 Feel! I'm about to wake it up! 
 Don't It feel so good girl 
 (Bridge - Akon) 
 Don't stop get it get it, 
 Bout' to jump up all in it 
 Love the way you drop low and bend it 
 Girl you're killing me, wait a minute 
 Love the way you that shake it up 
 Too natural you to make it up 
 Won't be long till we wake it up 
 (Chorus - Akon) 
 I know you ain't used to havin' 
 Real niggas around like me around

 To change your whole life girl, 
 So you don't deal with clowns 
 And treat you
