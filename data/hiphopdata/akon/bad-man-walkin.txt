(Feat. team invasion) 
 This goes out to them clowns 
 Talkin' bout they got the block locked down 
 Sewin up the compound 
 Only you if knew how my squad get down 
 You think you met a bad man walkin' 
 You ain't met a bad man till you walked up on me 
 Hit you with the glock 2 times 
 Fuckin' up my show shoe shine 
 Once you drop down 
 See niggas ain't got no dough 
 Fakin like they wanna be loco 
 I see you jakin my jewels 
 I ain't the one you want to stand next to 
 You think you met a bad man walkin' 
 You ain't met a bad man till you walked up on me 
 It's an invasion 
 Don't give a fuck black red caucasian 
 Yo yo between you and i 
 There's a truth no lie 
 You gon die 4 the fact that hood rules apply 
 I hold my ruger high 
 B4 I shoot the sky 
 Shoot your alla shoot your father 
 Haze got me super high 
 My team movin pies 
 My team move and rise 
 Clutchin on 45s 
 Fuck with us its suicide 
 'Cause you get crucified 
 Green got us flyin g-fulls 
 Commercial time we use to fly 
 I dare you to try 
 To test the evil genius 
 We got a crew and i 
 We a bunch of trigger squeezers 
 They call us nigga bleeders 
 We make niggas bleed 
 We can't get at you 
 Shit we kidnap your seed 
 And that's a hood rule 
 So beef in my streets 
 With my heat 
 Ain't no tellin' what I could do 
 Who write the crook rules 
 This is for the mixtapes in the streets 
 Nigga makin' shook moves 
 I ain't gonna tell you no lie 
 See them hood rules do apply 
 'F you choose not to abide 
 Guarantee you'll see a grown man cry 
 You think you met a bad man walkin' 
 You ain't met a bad man till you walked up on me 
 U think you been slidin 
 Way more grief than the nigga bin laden 
 'Cause we on the block all day 
 Some crooks some movin that ye 
 Gotta get that pay 
 Stick up kids tryin' to stomp that brake 
 You think seen a bad man walkin' 
 You ain't met a bad man till you walked up on me 
 Keep a double loose on here 
 You don't do that dance 
 Keep it under that sand 
 I got my nose in the hood like coke on the table 
 Go against my rule get a slug in your naval 
 Even my brother can get it true like can enable 
 Times are hard and the rich still do 
 So by any means nigga your ass is expendable 
 Hoes ain't a friend to me they're just my enemy 
 I only got love for dollar bills and hennesse 
 Most niggas ain't worthy of a slug or knife 
 So I pistol whip them dudes the blunt trauma 
 With the chrome laama 
 I learnt a lot from the mo' dramas 
 The game of life is more like blood-sport 
 That's why a lotta niggas gon died on the court 
 Rule 73 keep your gun oily clean 
 Just to be the last man standin at the crime scene 
 Heart beatin' crazy cold sweatin 'cause you made it 
 Now make ya escape with the toast and the cake 
 You met a bad man walkin' 
 You ain't met a bad man till you walked up on me 
 It's an invasion 
 Don't give a fuck black red caucasian
