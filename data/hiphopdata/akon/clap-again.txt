I'm like a bird and I am so high 
 In my lear lookin' at the blue sky 
 Can't let another day pass by without doin' what I feel inside 
 'Cause it's embedded in my soul 
 Day I stop will be the day I turn cold 
 Let you know I'm breaking outta that hole 
 And Let go so I can be free to do what means most to me 
 And You can look back one day and know I shared with you my kid 
 I hope you wouldn't think I'd just leave 
 Pack up and roll up my sleeve 
 Give it all up and leave you nothing and take with me all I got to give 
 That's why... 
 I just wanna make you clap again 
 Clap again 
 I just wanna make you clap again 
 Clap again 
 So if your life is twisted and ain't going right 
 Just forget about it tonight 
 I just wanna make you happy baby 
 Dancin' and clappin' baby 
 'Cause we plan to be here till the morning light 
 Can you feel the change in your life and it feelin' magic baby 
 I'm the one to make it happen baby 
 So you can be free to do what was meant to be 
 And You look back one day and know I shared with you my gift 
 Hope you wouldn't think I'd just leave pack up and roll up my sleeve 
 Give it all up and leave you nothing and take with me all I got to give 
 I just wanna make you clap again 
 Clap again 
 I just wanna make you clap again 
 Clap again 
 Clap... Clap (Outro)
