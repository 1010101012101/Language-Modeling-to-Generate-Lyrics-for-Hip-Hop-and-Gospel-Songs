 5 foot 8, on the late, what a date

 Snoop Dogg 
 Shirley Temple on ice, 
 She makes it just right, 
 That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice, 
 Her body's so tight up under that light, 
 I see her so clearly now, she's right there before my eyes 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
 She got me wanderin' now, 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer (dancer) 
 She got me day dreamin', 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) 
 Yes, I'm day dreamin', 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) 
 She got me day dreamin', 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) 
 Yes, I'm day dreamin', 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down that pipe) 
 Snoop Dogg 
 5 foot 8, on the late, what a date, 
 She fell for the hook and the bait, 
 I took her to the yacht, for shrimp and steak, 
 Then I took her to the gym, so she could get in shape, 
 What a night, no more drama, just late night thrills, 
 Nigga in the hood with the gangsta grillz, 
 Fillin' out stacks of bills, Jaguar like Jacksonville, 
 Breakin' these hoes like Jacks and Jill

 I'm lookin' at the most beautiful girl in the world (world, world, world) 
 Her body so perfect and spinnin' like a cinnamon swirl (swirl, swirl, swirl) 
 She looks like a fairy tale, but yet feels so natural (natural, natural, natural) 
 This one's a beast, but way to wonderful to be compared to an animal, 
 She's like what I'm sippin' on
