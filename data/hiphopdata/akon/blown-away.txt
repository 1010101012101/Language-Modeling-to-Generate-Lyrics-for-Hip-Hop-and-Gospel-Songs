 Cheh 
 (Styles P) 
 This shit is crazy 
 Crazy 
 (Akon) 
 It's one of those things man 
 You gotta experience to know what I'm talkin' about 
 Ha ha 
 It's where the goin' get rough 
 (Styles P) 
 Akon 
 (Akon) 
 The tough stay tough 
 (Styles P) 
 Styles P 
 (Akon) 
 Upfront 
 Let's go 
 Konvict 
 (Akon) 
 We in too deep to turn back now D 
 (Styles P) 
 Sure is 
 (Akon) 
 Watch yourself 
 Before you get 
 Blown away 
 (Styles P) 
 You know where I come from 
 The place where your fate is a mic 
 Or a bull or a dum dum 
 A jail cell a pine box 
 And brothers is dumb young 
 Young boys 
 Still bustin' guns for the slum 
 That they come from 
 Cops is the only ones they gon' run from 
 That's it 
 They puttin' they hood up 
 But 9 out of 10 of us ain't got good luck 
 You gon' ride on a man and catch 25 
 Or get hit and get sent to the other side 
 You lose both sides of the coin 
 So me I play the hood baby 
 Not in the 
 Mama got a little church I could join 
 But I didn't go yet 
 Man got a mosque I could join 
 But I didn't go yet 
 Cool with the devil on my back 
 I'm in cold sweats 
 Bout to do some dirt 
 In some dirty black old sweats 
 If you known you shoulda shown the way 
 Mosta the hood bout to get blown away 
 (Akon) 
 'Cause I was raised up to show no fear 
 Cowardly hearts'll never last long here 
 If you ain't man enough to make shit clear 
 Guaranteed you'll get blown away 
 'Cause I done seen the block break down tears 
 And I done seen the cops break my peers 
 Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years 
 Tryin' not to get blown away 
 See I ain't never shot nobody 
 But I'm known for fightin' 
 So when I strike man 
 You'll think you been struck by lightning 
 Shouldn't have to prove myself by killin' a nigga 
 Even a child could take a life by pullin' the trigga 
 Retaliation only takes anger mixed with passion 
 So you target in the distance and keep on blastin' 
 They say guns don't kill people, people do 
 So when you're hit man 
 You feel that shit the evils do 
 Can't see myself get beat down 
 My eyes swollen 
 Mom's cryin' they don't know what happened 
 My pride's stolen 
 If I ain't got my heat then I got a blade 
 That hit ya off 
 'Cause I was raised up to show no fear 
 Cowardly hearts'll never last long here 
 If you ain't man enough to make shit clear 
 Guaranteed you'll get blown away 
 'Cause I done seen the block break down tears 
 And I done seen the cops break my peers 
 Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years 
 Tryin' not to get blown away 
 Keep my eye out for jakes 
 Ears to the streets 
 Other eye out for snakes 
 And these scandalous freaks 
 If we ain't on good terms 
 Don't bother to speak 
 Don't smile and try to spark a convo with me 
 Same thing'll make ya laugh it'll make ya cry 
 This quiet nigga, he'll take ya life 
 Hate for it to be the world's sacrifice 
 If somebody else could travel 
 Through the tunnel of life 
 'Cause I'm that type of guy I'll be there 
 When you're ridin' 
 But I'll stay to myself 
 So if you see me out there 
 With a bear we fightin' 
 Then nigga go help the bear 
 'Cause I was raised up to show no fear 
 Cowardly hearts'll never last long here 
 If you ain't man enough to make shit clear 
 Guaranteed you'll get blown away 
 'Cause I done seen the block break down tears 
 And I done seen the cops break my peers 
 Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years
