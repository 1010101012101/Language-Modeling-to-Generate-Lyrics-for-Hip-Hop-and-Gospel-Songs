Rubbin on that italin leather 
 Konvict jeans on 
 Yo weezy ya ready 
 Yeah 
 I get it in till the sunrise 
 Going 90 in a 65 
 Windows rolled down screaming out 
 Hey-hey-hey I'm so paid 
 Number one hustler getting money 
 Why you wanna count my money 
 I'm a hustler and don't need one of them 
 One of y'all you see I'm so paid 
 I see police on that crooked 
 I'm doin' 100 on interstate 95 
 My shorty leanin blastin that do or die 
 Wishing a mother****er would 'cause we certified 
 Got a system that will beat and knock your wall off 
 Got a pump under my seat sawed off 
 Got a bunch of goons hope they never call off 
 I'm a sniper on the roof already saw y'all 
 Ain't too much to put a strain on me 
 That's the reason I had to put the blame on me 
 Id rather have them dollar bills rain on me 
 Than to let them haters come and make a name off me 
 That's why I get it in till the sun rise 
 Going 90 in a 65 
 Windows rolled down screaming out 
 Hey-hey-hey I'm so paid 
 Number one hustler getting money 
 Why you wanna count my money 
 I'm a hustler and don't need one of them 
 One of y'all you see that I'm so paid 
 I'm the boss it only takes one call 
 For a driver to hit you up and drop you off and that's all 
 Guess what, I won't be taking that fall 
 Homie I got cake that's what I'm paying them for 
 Haha ain't that funny 
 'Cause niggas they want war but ain't got money 
 'Cause I've seen them all talk until they start gunnin 
 Quicker than usian bolt the fastest thing runnin' 
 Yeah, akon and weezy 
 Black royal holding down jersey 
 Divine making sure we gettin' it up front 
 My little brother screw got that vision baby 
 I get it in till the sunrise 
 Going 90 in a 65 
 Windows rolled down screaming out 
 Hey-hey-hey I'm so paid 
 Number one hustler getting money 
 Why you want to count my money 
 I'm a hustler and don't need one of them 
 One of y'all you see I'm so paid 
 Ah-oh big money weezy 
 White wife-beater with a sig underneath it 
 How do I feel, b**** I feel undefeated 
 Snap my fingers disappear from the precinct yeah 
 We ball in and we ball out 
 Thoughts of we falling underneath the ball bounce 
 I send some niggas with guns at yalls house 
 Only to find out that you live in a doll house 
 Damn, but I thought you were tough though 
 We carry choppers on our necks call it cut throat 
 We bury powers from the set that we came from 
 We know magic turn weed smoke to gun smoke 
 We ball first when we ride 
 You in a hearse when you ride 
 I put my shoe down baby 
 And I'm holdin' down young mula baby 
 That's why I get it in till the sunrise 
 Going 90 in a 65 
 Windows rolled down screaming out 
 Hey-hey-hey I'm so paid 
 Number one hustler getting money 
 Why you wanna count my money 
 I'm a hustler and don't need one of them 
 One of y'all ya see I'm so paid.
