(Feat. Orlando Brown) 
 Chorus (Akon): 
 Everywhere 
 I go they starin' 
 Checkin' me out 
 And what I'm wearin' 
 The lights on my ice 
 Just starin' 
 And everywhere you go 
 I'm there 
 I'm exhausted from ballin' 
 Winter, spring 
 Summer and fall, and 
 I'm exhausted from ballin' 
 Winter, spring 
 Summer and fall, and 
 (Orlando Brown): 
 Big baller 
 Young shot caller 
 20 on the wrist 
 80 g's on the collar 
 Back from Japan 
 With a fresh 
 Million dollars 
 Pages to sleep 
 Wake up thank Allah 
 You're an A 
 Grab the hand so 
 Throw some threads on 
 Hop in the Lambo' 
 Freaks call me 
 Commando Orlando 
 Pushin' in the wind now 
 I'm out like a candle 
 You won't believe what I got 
 Honey foot 
 Got your cozy on top 
 And I just bought two more 
 Bentley cold drops 
 400 grand they both came 
 With a watch 
 You screw you pay me 
 80 karat gold 
 AK I'm crazy 
 Pull up on the block 
 With my eyes all hazy 
 Such a Konvict 
 I could steal your lady 
 (Yeah) 
 Everywhere I go 
 They starin' 
 (Everywhere I go) 
 Checkin' me out 
 And what I'm wearin' 
 (Checkin' me out) 
 The lights on my ice 
 Just starin' 
 (Hey, hey) 
 And everywhere you go 
 I'm there 
 I'm exhausted from ballin' 
 Winter, spring 
 Summer and fall 
 And 
 (Winter, spring, summer) 
 I'm exhausted from ballin' 
 (Oh, yeah) 
 Winter, spring 
 Summer and fall, and 
 It's high noon 
 Think I might 
 Just fly to Cancun 
 Where the ladies 
 Shake their 
 Boom, boom, boom 
 All my G-Force 
 Xoom, zoom, zoom 
 Then we arrive 
 Steppin' off the jet 
 I'm lookin' fly 
 Ask who designed this 
 I, this 
 My kicks, keep me paid 
 Feelin' like woah 
 That's more money I get 
 I just come to the island 
 Just to have a spot 
 Where we all be wild and 
 I fall texting, dialing 
 If you got some girlfriends 
 We'll be stylin' baby 
 The phantom can fit us all 
 Tell your man 
 You ain't trippin' off 
 Him at all 
 And that's for sure 
 I'm just ballin' 
 Way out of control 
 (Yeah)
