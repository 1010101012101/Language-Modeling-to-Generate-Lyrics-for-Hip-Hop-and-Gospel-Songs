 Go gangsta keep boppin' (block royal) 
 Rock wit me let's get this bitch poppin' (Upfront) 
 Go gangsta keep boppin' (g-eah) 
 Like back when the nigga was clockin' 
 See now a days seems like 'erbody wanna be killas 
 Gorillas gettin' high off they weed and liquor... you die quicker 
 Paramedics drive back slow... to the hospital 
 You get pronounced dead at 4... to the hospital 
 So stop frontin' when you know you won't pull none (pull none) 
 First nigga to retreat when the tools bust (tools bust) 
 Playin' with death is bad for your health 
 All your homeboys gone you da last one left now 
 They hearts beatin' but these nigga's be scared (scared) 
 The real ones are all locked up or dead (dead) 
 Now a days you can't find a good connect 
 But if you do you might be the feds so... 
 I don't know you 
 You don't know me 
 You don't know the history I got on these streets 
 Only if you seen what my eyes have seen 
 Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's 
 If you owe me or we got beef I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze 
 Pause for a minute guarantee you gon' bleed 
 'Cause that's how we was raised growin' up in these streets 
 Go gangsta keep boppin' 
 Rock wit me let's get this bitch poppin' 
 Go gangsta keep boppin' 
 Like back when the nigga was clockin' 
 See its hard (eh) to be good easy to do evil and I ain't really into meetin' wit new people 
 Jus' put the money in the bag and I'll leave you with the weed, coke, lambo, or visa 
 You make a hundred dollars to the streets you made a G (uh-huh) 
 When you coppin O's they swearin you move keys (uh-huh) 
 Feds getting close 'n the rats seen cheese 
 And they tryin' find 'em birds 
 Not the one that sleep in trees (uh-huh) 
 We got that purp 
 We got that blue (chikaa!) 
 You want short skirts 
 We got that too 
 Whatever you need 
 My nigga show me the cheese and baby you could believe that we can make that brew 
 I don't know you 
 You don't know me 
 You don't know the history I got on these streets 
 Only if you seen what my eyes have seen 
 Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's 
 If you owe me or we got beef I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze 
 Pause for a minute guarantee you gon' bleed 
 'Cause that's how we was raised growin' up in these streets 
 Go gangsta keep boppin' (eh eh eh) 
 Rock wit me let's get this bitch poppin' (eh eh eh) 
 Go gangsta keep boppin' (eh eh eh) 
 Like back when the nigga was clockin' (eh eh eh) 
 Streets been watchin' and they don't blink 
 Sidewalk got ears the pavement don't sleep 
 The fittest will survive the weak just don't eat 
 Everybody in between just gettin' a rap sheet 
 The streets been watchin' and they don't blink
