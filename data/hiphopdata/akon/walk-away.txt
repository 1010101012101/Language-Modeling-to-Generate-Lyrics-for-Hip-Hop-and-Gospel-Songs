Facing trouble every day 
 Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow 
 It's a struggle every day 
 Trying not to rob G's, Steal or Borrow 
 I need to take it slow 
 My heart is growing cold 
 I'm trying to hide my feelings 
 From the people that I know 
 And everywhere I go I'm trying to lay low 
 Can't afford to get in no trouble 'cause I'm on parole 
 I'm trying to live life right 
 God knows with all my might 
 But I'm just barely getting by 
 'Cause money's way too tight 
 And I can say this right 
 The struggle and the fight 
 It's weakin' all the muscles in my body like kryptonite 
 Making me feel like there is no other way 
 But the different streets get that dough 
 Living and praying for a better day... So! 
 Facing trouble every day 
 Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow 
 It's a struggle every day 
 Trying not to rob G's, Steal or Borrow 
 Streets, I ain't no longer on it 
 Don't need feds all upon it 
 I done left that life alone 
 'Cause all I did was impress, my homie! 
 And then my conscience told me 
 "Careful you tendarone!" 
 Always complaining after I ain't never did 
 She always lonely. So what am I to do 
 Gotta get money for food, 'cause if she starves to death 
 Then I gotta deal with her attitude 
 And I in that type of mood 'cause I ain't type of dude 
 It's bad enough, I gotta deal with all this I'm going through 
 It's making me feel like there is no other way 
 But the different streets get that dough 
 Hoping and praying for a better day... So! 
 Facing trouble every day 
 Trying to walk away from a life of sorrow 
 It's a struggle every day 
 Trying not to rob G's, Steal or Borrow
