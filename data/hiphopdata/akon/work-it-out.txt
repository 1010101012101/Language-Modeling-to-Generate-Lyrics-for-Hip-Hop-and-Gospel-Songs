(Feat. Keyshia Cole) 
 (Konvict) 
 Ooh-uh-ooh (o-uh-oh, o-uh-oh) 
 Akon and Keyshia Cole 
 O-uh-oh, o-uh-oh 
 Akon: 
 I may look scandalous, baby girl lemme tell you one thing 
 I'm a real live g 
 You'll be laced up in diamonds 
 In every type cut 
 One thing I can guarantee 
 I know everybody all in your ear 
 Got you thinking like he ain't the one for me 
 But you know how I make you feel girl, keep it real, 
 Ain't shit they can say about me 
 Except that I'm misunderstood 
 Always hanging in the hood 
 Getting that money like I should 
 Grippin on leather and wood 
 Can't stop us from get'n too it 
 This ain't like you girl wus good 
 Come here girl and let's get into it 
 And lemme see that smile 
 (Chorus: Keyshia Cole) 
 I know he ain't right for me 
 But the swagger so crazy 
 He ain't right for me still wanna be his lady 
 No he ain't right, but the one, that is just don't phase me 
 Why don't it phase me, why don't it phase me. 
 Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, and work it out 
 Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, and work it out 
 Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, and work it out 
 Just do your thang girl~ now work it out, and work it out 
 Keyshia Cole: 
 Hes like the light that sees me through the storm 
 When hes around, ain't nothing brighter than 
 Brighter than my baby, it's amazing, got me crazy 
 And I can't seem to help myself 
 All my life I've been waiting, (waiting) 
 For someone like you to come save me, (come save me) 
 But you turned out to be so unfaithful 
 How could I still love you 
 I know he ain't right for me (how could I still love you) 
 But the swagger so crazy 
 He ain't right for me still wanna be his lady 
 No he ain't right, but the one, that is just don't phase me 
 Why don't it phase me, why don't it phase me. 
 Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, and work it out 
 Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, and work it out 
 Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, and work it out 
 Just do your thang girl~ now work it out, and work it out 
 Keyshia Cole: 
 I try to stay up, hes my wake up call 
 4:30 in the morning, he didn't call me 
 Either way I'm feeling, try to fake it up 
 'Cause I love how you touch me boy 
 Ooh~losing control and I'm waiting for 
 The next time you hold me close and tell me I'm beautiful 
 Just let me go, I can't let go 
 I know I'm outta my mind, 'cause I know that (he ain't right) 
 I know he ain't right for me 
 But the swagger so (he just ain't right) crazy 
 He ain't right for me still wanna be his lady (yeah) 
 Though he ain't right, but the one, that is just don't phase me 
 (He just ain't right) 
 Why don't it phase me, why don't it phase me. 
 Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, (ooh) and work it out 
 Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, (work it out) and work it out 
 Now do your thang girl~ and work it out, (eh, eh, eh, eh) and work it out 
 Just do your thang girl~ now work it out, (WORK IT OUT) and work it out 
 Now do your thang girl~ and work it out (go head and do it) 
 Now do (do it, do it) your thang girl~ and work it out (WORK IT OUT) 
 Now do (eh, eh, eh) your thang girl~ and work it out 
 (Go head and do it) 
 Just do (do it, do it) your thang girl~ now work it out 
 (Outro: Keyshia Cole) 
 Do it, do it, Baby, Babey ooh
