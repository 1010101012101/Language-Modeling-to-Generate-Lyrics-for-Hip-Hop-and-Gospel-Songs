 Yeah that's right I'm fuckin' ill from all of the pills that's what made me crazy and behaven shady but shit it's a blessin intstead of a bussin if you know what I'm sayn 
 'Cause there is allways some one that's got the gun that ain't afraid to make everybody run but ay you know what I say me and my boy ben will do that shit with lyrics so sick make any bitch wanna suck the dick and make ne nigga rappa wanna run 'cause we just spit hot shit for fun
