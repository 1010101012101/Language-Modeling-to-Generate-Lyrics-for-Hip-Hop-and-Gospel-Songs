I am here at the crossroad 
 Where my life is heading man I don't know. 
 Should I stay or should I go? 
 'Cause anything is better then I been through 
 What I would give to get a sign from up above 
 Letting me know that everything would be ok 
 I wish someone could pull me out of the mud 
 Will anyone out there say to me? 
 I'm here, For you 
 Don't worry 'cause I got you 
 I got you baby 
 Don't trip 
 Don't stress 
 My life seems to be headed 
 Over the edge 
 It's like I'm headed 
 Over the edge 
 Now everyday that goes by, 
 I see things that would make another man cry 
 I'm sitting wondering why 
 I can't find that someone to fit in my life 
 I was searching 
 But am I worth it? 
 And will they ever think I'm good enough for them 
 Despite my suffering, 
 I felt the loving 
 The blessing came when I needed it the most 
 And that is the sign I received from above 
 Letting me know that everything is going to be ok 
 And that she was that something that pulled me out of the mud 
 And also the one who said to me 
 I'm here, For you 
 Don't worry 'cause I got you 
 I got you baby 
 Don't trip 
 Don't stress 
 My life seems to be headed 
 Over the edge 
 It's like I'm headed 
 Over the edge 
 No matter no matter how far you fall 
 You gotta you gotta be ready to stand up 
 I've been through the same things you're going through now 
 But you gotta believe in me
