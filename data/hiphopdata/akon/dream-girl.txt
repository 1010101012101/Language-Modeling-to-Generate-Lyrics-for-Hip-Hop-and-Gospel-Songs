(Tay Dizm) 
 Nappy Boy! 
 Ooowww! 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 (She's just the type) That I been searchin' for all my life 
 (The type) That'll make a nigga so proud 
 (The type) That'll rather make love than fight 
 (The type) That gets it poppin' every single night 
 She's my dream girl my one and only 
 My dream girl love it when she call on me 
 She's my dream girl my lover my homie 
 My dream girl it's just me and you against the world. 
 (Tay Dizm) 
 Ass poked out like Lisa Ray jelly hips thighs waist Gabrielle Union's face 
 Strapped with Oprah Winfrey's cheese in a house on a hill in the West Indies 
 If you let me I could give you anything that you need 
 Speedin' switchin' lanes wide open 
 You're what I'm lookin' for for certain 
 There's no person that could take your place 
 I'm like a fat kid with cake when we face to face 
 Heart paced when you're here but erased when you're gone 
 Kinda hard to pick a team when your racin' alone. 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 (She's just the type) That I been searchin' for all my life 
 (The type) That'll make a nigga so proud 
 (The type) That'll rather make love than fight 
 (The type) That gets it poppin' every single night 
 She's my dream girl my one and only 
 My dream girl love it when she call on me 
 She's my dream girl my lover my homie 
 My dream girl it's just me and you against the world. 
 (Tay Dizm) 
 First time nigga Dizm put his eyes on you 
 No lie girl I feel like my dream came true 
 You and I plus ten and a little bit more 
 And the motions in your hips got your boy like Whoa! 
 You the type of girl that'd keep it (...) 
 (...) 
 You my dream girl baby so it's all about you twenty-four seven 
 (...) 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 (She's just the type) That I been searchin' for all my life 
 (The type) That'll make a nigga so proud 
 (The type) That'll rather make love than fight 
 (The type) That gets it poppin' every single night 
 She's my dream girl (YAY!) my one and only 
 My dream girl (OK!) love it when she call on me 
 She's my dream girl (Yeah!) my lover my homie 
 My dream girl it's just me and you against the world. 
 (Tay Dizm) 
 She's my dream girl gonna make her my only 
 She's my dream girl I want you to put it on me 
 She's my dream girl wanna make her my baby 
 I'm goin' crazy for you 
 (For you) 
 (She's just the type) That I been searchin' for all my life 
 (The type) That'll make a nigga so proud 
 (The type) That'll rather make love than fight 
 (The type) That gets it poppin' every single night 
 She's my dream girl my one and only 
 My dream girl love it when she call on me 
 She's my dream girl my lover my homie 
 My dream girl it's just me and you against the world.
