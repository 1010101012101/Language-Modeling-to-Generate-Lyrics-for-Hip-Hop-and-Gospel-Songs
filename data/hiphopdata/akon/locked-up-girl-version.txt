 No matter how far I go

 No registration

 Cops patrolin'

 And now they don't stop me and I get locked up 
 They won't let me out, they won't let me out 
 (I'm locked up)

 Headin' uptown to re-up 
 (Re-up) 
 Back with a couple keys 
 (Keys) 
 Corner blocks on fire 
 (Fire) 
 Under covers dressed as fiends 
 (Fiends) 
 Makin' so much money

 Ride up smooth and fast

 Put away the stash 
 And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up 
 They won't let me out, they won't let me out 
 (My nigga I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out no, they won't let me out 
 (I got locked up) 
 They won't let me out, they won't let me out 
 (Baby girl I'm locked up)

 'Cause visitation no longer comes by 
 (Comes by) 
 Seems like they forgot about me 
 (About me) 
 Commissary is getting empty 
 (Empty) 
 My cell mates getting food without me 
 (Without me) 
 Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life 
 (Move on with my life) 
 Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right 
 But instead I'm here locked up 
 They won't let me out, they won't let me out 
 (Oh I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

 Send me some money orders 
 (They won't let me out, no) 
 Maybe a visit baby 
 (They won't let me out) 
 'Cause I'm locked up
