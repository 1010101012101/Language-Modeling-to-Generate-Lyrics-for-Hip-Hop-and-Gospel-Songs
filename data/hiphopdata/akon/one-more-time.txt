One more time, one more time, 
 Live it one more time, one more time. 
 What if you never see tomorrow again, 
 And it's the last party that you attend, 
 Let's live it up like it's 3010 
 What if this was the end. 
 So invite all your family and friends 
 'Cause they should be celebrating, 
 Let's make the best up this time that we spend, 
 'Cause if this is the end, I want you to 
 Live like you don't plan to wake up, 
 Live like you don't plan to wake up, 
 Live like you don't plan to wake up, 
 Live like you don't plan to wake up, 
 Live like you don't plan to wake up, 
 Live like you don't plan to wake up, 
 Live like you don't plan to wake up, 
 Live like you don't plan to wake up. 
 Harder people put your hands high, 
 I know you ... and I know you're high 
 Don't let you me and I don't let you, 
 Only got one life, you know what to do 
 So live your sorrow and your pain, 
 Leave your fortunate and your pain, 
 You can leave it all behind 'cause you will never see it again, 
 And you're thinking back to this day 
 I want you to be able to say that you would gladly do it again.
