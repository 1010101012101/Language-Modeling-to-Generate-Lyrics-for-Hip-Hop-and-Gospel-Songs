Fallin' in Love 
 Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah 
 (Part1) 
 So soft... and smooth... 
 Never knew a girl could be so god damn cold 
 I know 
 The way she move got me spendin my do 
 And y'all 
 If you would've seen what I've seen on that pole 
 Just know, that I was wrong for fallin' in Loveeee 
 I was wrong for fallin' in loveeeeee (they always said don't love a ho) 
 I was wrong for fallin' in loveeeeee (don't do it yo) 
 I was wrong for fallin' in loveeeeee (they always said don't love a ho) 
 But I just went against the grain 
 It was a feelin' I can't explain 
 And it felt like harmony 
 Singin' in my face 
 Like diddi daddi do da dee 
 Don't want that you ever go away 
 I want you around me everyday 
 Singin' in my face 
 Like diddi daddi do dadee 
 (Part 2) 
 Look at me... 
 I'm stuck 
 That bubble in her pants got me caught up 
 I Never Had no luck 
 Thinkin' the wrong hand got me jumpin' out there 
 With no gloves 
 It feels so good had me sprung out on that stuff 
 Now I'm stuck 
 That's what I get for fallin' in loveeee 
 That's what I get for fallin' in loveeee (they always said don't love a ho) 
 That's what I get for fallin' in loveeee (don't do it yo) 
 That's what I get for fallin' in loveeee (they always said don't love a ho) 
 But I just went against the grain 
 It was a feelin' I can't explain 
 And it felt like harmony 
 Singin' in my face 
 Like diddi daddi do da dee 
 Don't want that you ever go away 
 I want you around me everyday 
 Singin' in my face 
 Like diddi daddi do dadee

 So thick... so rough... 
 That oil all over her body stole my heart 
 I'm caught... 
 The way she drop down wont allow me to close my jaws 
 'Cause I... 
 Already in love and I knew better from the start 
 Oh no...

 Said I was wrong for fallin' in loveeeeee (don't do it yo)

 But I just went against the grain 
 It was a feelin' I can't explain 
 And it felt like harmony 
 Singin' in my face 
 Like diddi daddi do da dee 
 Don't want that you ever go away 
 I want it around me everyday 
 Singin' in my face
