Hey girl 
 I see you standin next to him 
 And I can tell you ain't happy... 
 You rather be on the side of the club 
 Ballin' out with a niggah like me... 
 I can see you imaginin' those thoughts in your head 
 By the way your staring'... 
 I'll help your fantasies come true 
 All you gotta do is look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Ill take you to that place 
 All I ask is look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Baby look me in my eyes 
 What it do mama they call me young blast 
 And I couldn't help but stop soon as I roll past yah... 
 I see your pretty face, you ain't supposed to frown 
 Then whose your man, anywaise I'm gonna hold you down... 
 And I don't brag but he ain't fly like me 
 He ain't loyal, by your side, down to ride like me... 
 Now look around ain't no guys like me 
 You can look into my eyes and see 
 I'm a playa for real... 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Ill take you to that place 
 All I ask is look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Look me in my eyes 
 Baby look me in my eyes 
 I see you peepin' mama 
 You know I'm watchin' you... 
 Can tell you want me 
 So tell me what's from stopping you... 
 I'm all the things that your man can't be 
 Down to do it all, fulfill your fantasy... 
 I need a freak down in late night creek 
 Hop up in the coupe, then we cruise throught the streets... 
 Ride to the telly then its straight to the suite 
 Turn the lights low and then its straight to the sheets... 
 Your man bumpin you don't need that mess 
 All I need is one night let me ease that stress... 
 Here runnin' game ma' I ain't got a lot of you 
 Akon sing the hook tell her what she gotta do 
 So what I gotta do to take you home? 
 We ballin' out in the club buyin' shots of patrone... 
 Rake you to that place where we can escape, alone 
 Turn of the side-kicks, two-ways and phones... 
 So what's it gon' be? 
 Its either him or me... 
 When you ready shorty I'll be in the v.i.p 
 We livin' good baby rollin' in cash 
 Chunk your man a deuce tell him that your rollin' with blast
