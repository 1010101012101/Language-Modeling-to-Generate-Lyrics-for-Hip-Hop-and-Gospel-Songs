 See that girl there, looks so good 
 But simply I don't trust her 
 And the things she wears 
 Got me feelin' so eco feel like a buster? 
 She got me so high 
 One touch of her mind and that's the reason I lost her 
 Cz I'm that type a guy 
 Got nothing to hide 
 Simply I wanna plug ya 
 Bobby Moon: 
 Sun shining from acroos the room 
 Looking so sexy staring right at me? 
 There's something about the way she moves 
 Got me hypnotized; it's the hips and thighs 
 Not the type of guy to waste no time 
 Only got one thing that's on my mind 
 So fly that you got me sprung? 
 Got me speaking in tongues 
 Tere Ankon keh nashein mein 
 Sason ki yeah dharmi 
 Meri dil ki dhadkan 
 Akon:

 Bobby Moon: 
 Something 'bout her so mysterious 
 Got my attention, no question 
 Things about me so sexual 
 Wanna bet, put it on me girl? 
 Not the type of guy to waste no time 
 Only got one thing that's on my mind 
 So fly that you got me sprung? 
 Got me speaking in tongues 
 Tere Ankon keh nashein mein 
 Sason ki yeah dharmi 
 Meri dil ki dhadkan

 Bobby Moon: 
 So affective what shall I do 
 Kya karu ya kya na karu 
 Can't keep my hands off of you 
 Ye kya baat, ye dil kya hoo wa? 
 So what's the deal, you coming with me 
 You got what I want 
 I got what you need 
 If you don't want no one to know? 
 Nobody will know 
 Girl it's just you and me 
 Tere Ankon keh nashein mein 
 Sason ki yeah dharmi 
 Meri dil ki dhadkan
