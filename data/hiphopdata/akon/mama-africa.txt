 So much 
 OOWW! 
 So much love to share 
 Pure blackness, oneness so rare 
 So much love to care 
 Let them know they're missin' out 
 Mama Africa has 
 So much love to share 
 Sweet blackness, oneness be there 
 So much love to care 
 Let them know they missin' out 
 Sing again 
 This is for all the love 
 And the life took away 
 F 
 Don't forget we were born in trade 
 R 
 Ripped from the land and shipped away 
 I 
 Is the inspiration we used to survive 
 C 
 Have to see it with your own cries 
 Don't play 
 Add it up and alright 
 Still ya don't know 
 Land is so gold and green 
 The place is so fresh and clean 
 And everyday I water my garden 
 Tell if you feel it deep in your heart and 
 The space is so cool and nice 
 Visit once, guaranteed to visit twice 
 And if you just believe in the most high 
 I know you'll be alright 
 Mama Africa has 
 So much love to share 
 Pure blackness, oneness so rare 
 So much love to give 
 And let them know they're missin'out 
 Mama Africa you 
 So much love to share 
 Sweet blackness, oneness be there 
 So much love to care 
 And let them know they missin' out 
 Sing again 
 That's my favorite place when I need to get away 
 F 
 Must forget but we can't forget to pray 
 R 
 Like Lance ridin' on the runway 
 I 
 In my homeland and I'm feelin' so alive 
 C 
 Hear me chant Africa unite 
 Gonna accept the mass alright 
 Still ya don't know 
 Skin is so dark and brown 
 She lifts me right off the ground 
 But no ya not gonna see it on ya tv 
 So yo just listen up and believe me 
 Her trees have the only cure 
 Her love is so blue and pure 
 Had to kiss them troubles goodbye bye 
 No I don't have to lie mama Africa, you got 
 So much love to share 
 Pure blackness, oneness so rare 
 So much love to care 
 Let them know they're missin' out 
 Mama Africa 
 So much love to share 
 Sweet blackness, oneness be there 
 So much love to care 
 And let them know that they missin' out 
 Mama Africa 
 So much so much love 
 So much 
 So tell me can you feel it 
 So much so much care 
 So much 
 Make that visit 
 So much so much love 
 So much 
 Senegal can you feel it 
 So much so much care 
 So much 
 Ooow! 
 So much love to share 
 I just can't see how we livin' without it 
 So much love to care 
 Don't miss don't miss one moment about it 
 So much love to share 
 Resist this bliss yo I really doubt it 
 So much love to care

 So much love to share (ooh yeah) 
 Pure blackness, oneness so rare

 So much love to care 
 Let them know they're missin' out

 So much love to share 
 Sweet blackness, oneness be there 
 So much love to care 
 Let them know they're missin' out 
 Sing again
