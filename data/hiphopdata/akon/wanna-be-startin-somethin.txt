(Feat. Michael Jackson) 
 I met her on the walk way 
 Staring as she walked past 
 She looked back at me sideways and said 
 I can't help but to ask 
 I said you wanna be startin' somethin' 
 You got to be startin' somethin' 
 I said you wanna be startin' somethin' 
 You got to be startin' somethin' 
 We end up going back to her place 
 Wish I could tell you what I saw 
 The sexiest women in a necklace shade 
 We hit off until the morning 
 Until you hear her say 
 (Adlib: Akon) 
 Ama ma se, 
 Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa 
 Ma ma se, ma ma sa, 
 Ma ma coo sa 
 Ama ma se, 
 Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa [x3] 
 Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa 
 Ma ma se, ma ma sa, 
 Ma ma coo sa 
 (What did I make her say) 
 Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa 
 Ma ma se, ma ma sa, 
 Ma ma coo sa 
 Ama ma se, 
 Ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa [x6] 
 (Verse 1: Akon) 
 Billie Jean is always talkin' 
 When nobody else Is talkin' 
 Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders 
 So they called her mouth a motor 
 Someone's always tryin' to start my baby cryin' 
 Talkin', squealin', lyin' 
 Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin' 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 I said you wanna be startin' somethin', 
 You got to be startin' somethin'. 
 I said you wanna be startin' somethin', 
 You got to be startin' somethin' 
 Too high to get over (YEA YEA) 
 Too low to get under(YEA YEA) 
 You're stuck in the middle (YEA YEA) 
 The pain is thunder (YEA YEA) 
 Too high to get over (YEA YEA) 
 Too low to get under (YEA YEA) 
 You're stuck in the middle (YEA YEA) 
 The pain is thunder (YEA YEA) 
 (VERSE 2: Michael Jackson) 
 You love to pretend that you're good 
 When you're always up to no good 
 You really can't make him hate her 
 So your tongue became a razor 
 Someone's always tryin' to start my baby cryin' 
 Talkin', squealin', lyin' you got my baby cryin' 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 I said you wanna be startin' somethin', 
 You got to be startin' somethin'. 
 I said you wanna be startin' somethin', 
 You got to be startin' somethin' 
 (MJ and Akon)

 (I'm tryin' to make her stay) 
 (Bridge: Akon) 
 It's getting lil' crazy (is getting crazy) 
 Always messing with my baby (messing with my baby) 
 And that's the reason she cries 
 When I am not by her side 
 At the lonliest night (without my baby) 
 But I lo-ve you 
 Always poppin' when I think about you 
 I wanna bring back the night and share 
 With that look on your face 
 When you say 
 (Adlib: Akon)
