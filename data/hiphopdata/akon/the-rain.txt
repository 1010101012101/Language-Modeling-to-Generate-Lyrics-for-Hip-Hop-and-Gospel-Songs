Yeah 
 Oh diddy oh diddy oh 
 Akon 
 Konvict 
 Konvict Music! 
 Yeah 
 The pressure's building up 
 I feel like givin' up 
 How in the fuck am I gonna back my first album up 
 When everything has changed? 
 It'll never be the same 
 Nobody knew me than everybody knows my name 
 And I feel so ashamed 
 I've never been the kind of nigga that would complain 
 But it's so crazy, man 
 There's no different 
 Everyday is just the same thing 
 Now it's been months out on the road 
 On tour doin' so many different shows 
 Head spinnin' feelin' like it's gonna explode 
 And I just wanna know 
 If anybody out there's feelin' me 
 I'm losin' my mind and I can't believe 
 I let this shit get the best of me 
 And now I gotta let you know 
 Once got me insane, oh 
 'Cause I can't stand the Rain, hey 
 It's hitting my window pane 
 A little too much 
 And now I gotta let you know 
 Once I got my face in the frown, hey 
 'Cause I can't stand the sound, oh 
 Of the thunder that's crashing down 
 Upon my house 
 'Cause now I gotta let you know 
 Now I got no more worries now 
 My pocket's fatter now 
 Look in the mirror my reflections looks different now 
 It gettin' bigger 
 Akon, you need to settle down 
 Why do I feel this way? 
 Should I be happy or should I just ignore? 
 Everything that I've been givin' please help me, Lord 
 Please help me, Lord 
 It's all over but 
 I can't escape the Rain 
 Now it's been months out on the road 
 On tour doin' so many different shows 
 Head spinnin' feelin' like it's gonna explode 
 And now I gotta let you know 
 If anybody out there's feelin' me 
 I'm losin' my mind and I can't believe 
 I let this shit get the best of me 
 And now I gotta let you know 
 Once got me insane, oh 
 'Cause I can't stand the Rain, hey 
 It's hitting my window pain 
 A little too much 
 That's why I gotta let you know 
 Once I got my face in the frown, hey 
 'Cause I can't stand the sound, oh 
 Of the thunder that's crashing down 
 Upon my house 
 Singin' whoa diddy whoa diddy whoa
