I'm from the hard knock academy, automatically had to be 
 Carryin' automatics, sprayin' (unverified), inaccurate 
 Clips to the back of it, barrel, cockin' it, immaculate 
 Learn to move packages in and out of Los Angeles 
 We savages, bustin' off rounds, sprayin' banana clips 
 Knockin' pills off like Anna Nicole Smith 
 Shit, I'm in the hood, walkin' with choppers 
 Cock 'em and pop 'em coppers, glocks be talkin' like 
 Blockedie block, block 
 I probably popped Hoffa and possibly just forgot where I tossed 'em 
 This nigga's obnoxious, me and Top got your picture in the cockpit 
 She wanna pit stop, just see how the cock spit 
 These bosses deposit the profit, they watch as we cop it 
 On top of the ostrich and foxes 
 It use to be the lil' guys in stress 
 Now I'ma boss where I'm from 
 With the last stress on my chest 
 See I know you'll like my swagger 
 No strap when I come through 
 Chain hangin' like Ali Baba 
 Know me, ya know how I do 
 The way that I move, nigga 
 (Ya neva gonna get it) 
 'Cause I'm to smooth, nigga 
 (Ya neva gonna get it) 
 I thought you knew, nigga 
 (Ya neva gonna get it) 
 You ain't got a clue, nigga 
 (Ya neva gonna get it) 
 Who in the hell left the gate open? 
 I'm pretty down for the wild, wild west 
 Like them 1800s in 'em stage coaches 
 If I ain't strapped then my blaze pokin' 
 If it ain't a 600 big body, then the 6 4 0, honey, is spokin' 
 The drama spokesman, streets endorsed 'em 
 I rather be up in my nine, then closed in my coffin 
 I'm from West Covina, this ain't Compton 
 Still money passed around like we takin' an offerin' 
 I'm somethin' like a phenomenon 
 When they see the sad happy faces, they know the drama is on 
 It's the west coast back at your front door 
 We up close and personal, we ain't done till the curtains close 
 Could be friend or foe, love it or hate it 
 I'm the king but I play with the aces 
 Run up to find out I keep it loaded like bases 
 Ya wise in your mouth but need braces? 
 See I know you'll like my swagger 
 No strap when I come through 
 Chain hangin' like Ali Baba 
 Know me, ya know how I do 
 The way that I move, nigga 
 (Ya neva gonna get it) 
 'Cause I'm to smooth, nigga 
 (Ya neva gonna get it) 
 I thought you knew, nigga 
 (Ya neva gonna get it) 
 You ain't got a clue, nigga 
 (Ya neva gonna get it) 
 See when I walk through the door 
 I wonderin' why these fake niggas jackin' me for? 
 On display, like I came from the store 
 Posin' like a mannequin in front of your hoe 
 Up front, blockin' 151 peep now? 
 Convicts surround the whole compound 
 'Cause you don't really want what you're starin' at 
 Clip full of bullets, don't mind sharin' that thing 
 See I know you'll like my swagger 
 No strap when I come through 
 Chain hangin' like Ali Baba 
 Know me, ya know how I do 
 The way that I move, nigga 
 (Ya neva gonna get it) 
 'Cause I'm to smooth, nigga 
 (Ya neva gonna get it) 
 I thought you knew, nigga 
 (Ya neva gonna get it) 
 You ain't got a clue, nigga 
 (Ya neva gonna get it)
