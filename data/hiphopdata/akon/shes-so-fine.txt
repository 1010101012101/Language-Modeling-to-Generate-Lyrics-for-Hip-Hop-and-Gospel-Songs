See that girl think that she so fine 
 I must believe her 'cause I'm losing my mind 
 Look like the type that loves to wind and dine 
 But I plan to get it without spending a dime 
 By doing me the way I do it 
 By doing me the way I do it 
 If you seen this chick infront of you 
 I promise you will lose it 
 By doing me the way I do it 
 By doing me the way I do it 
 I'm so fricken confident 
 Id get her that I will go prove it 
 I'm every dope girl dream 
 I'm dope boy clean 
 See you looking at me I'm this dope boy teen 
 What I does is what I does 
 In just afew seconds she be in love 
 I'm a gangsta man, all of the above 
 I ain't gotta drop stacks to get 'em out of the club 
 I just kick back let it do what it do 
 See the chain swayin she be stuck like glue 
 Throwin' money at the roof 
 (?) 
 Inside henny outside goose 
 It costs a pretty penny 
 Dollar got juice 
 Shoot games she gone get loose 
 See that girl think that she so fine 
 I must believe her 'cause I'm losing my mind 
 Look like the type that loves to wind and dine 
 But I plan to get it without spending a dime

 Id get her that I will go prove it 
 Now watch her do that dance 
 How she do move got me in my trance 
 I forgot my plans 
 I'm tryna keep focused the best I can 
 But (but) but she's so fine 
 If looks could kill, id probably be dyin' 
 I'm hard to touch but easy to find 
 Neighbourhood block boy, I'll be on my grind 
 I ain't droppin' a dime, gotta different approach 
 Get 'em on my line, 
 I just pull up and hop out, 
 She chews up, we mash out 
 See that girl think that she so fine 
 I must believe her 'cause I'm losing my mind 
 Look like the type that loves to wind and dine 
 But I plan to get it without spending a dime 
 By doing me the way I do it

 Women goin' nuts when I ride by 
 Id be fresh, id be cool 
 Pretty young dude but I keep that too 
 Tryin' my [? ] she must be fools 
 I call the shots, I make the moves 
 I hit the spot, have you singin' them blues 
 I drop the top watch them stop and chew 
 See I walk like a [? ]

 Sitting back in the park, we could [? ] 
 I ain't gotta floss to have a chick [? ] 
 I ain't one of these other niggas asking them what it cost
