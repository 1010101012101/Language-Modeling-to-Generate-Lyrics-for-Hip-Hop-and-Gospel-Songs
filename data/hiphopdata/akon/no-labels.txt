We may not understand this whole process and how things go 
 I'm just an ordinary man tryna live free and god knows 
 See a man with a blue tie 
 See a man with a red tie 
 So how about we tie ourselves together and get it done 
 Do what's right for America 
 And all we ask from you is some honesty 
 And motivation give us something we believe 
 I'm only one man with a voice to something we got in common 
 Need a model well then look at me 
 He's a democrat 
 He's republican 
 There's a fight and a race who's gonna win 
 Put your differences aside man if you can 
 'Cause there's way too many people suffering 
 I wish they didn't have no labels 
 There'd be more change with no labels 
 My kids will grow up soon 
 Your kids will grow up too 
 Wouldn't you like to see them raised up next to good hospitals and good schools 
 Don't want 'em in a juvenile facility or growing up with mental disabilities 
 When all this time you could've made a difference but you decided to roll with the party 
 Are you kidding me 
 'Cause all we ask from you is some honesty 
 And motivation give us something we believe 
 I'm only one man with a voice to something we got in common 
 Need a model well then look at me
