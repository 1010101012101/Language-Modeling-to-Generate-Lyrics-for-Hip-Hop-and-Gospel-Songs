One more time, one more time, 
 Live it one more time, one more time. 
 What if you never see tomorrow again, 
 And this the last party that you attend, 
 Let's live it up like it's 3010 
 What if this was the end 
 So invite all your family and friends 
 Cause there should be a celebration, 
 Let's make the best of this time that we spend, 
 'Cause if this is the end, I want you to 
 Live like you don't plan to wake up (x8) 
 Hey party people, put your hands high, 
 I know you're drunk and I know you're high 
 Don't lecture me, I won't lecture you, 
 Only got one life, you know what to do 
 So leave your sorrow and your pain, 
 Leave your fortune and your pain, 
 You can leave it all behind 'cause you will never see it again, 
 When you're thinking back to this day 
 I want you to be able to say that you would gladly do it again, 
 Gladly do it again. 
 What if you never see tomorrow again, 
 And this the last party that you attend, 
 Let's live it up like it's 3010 
 What if this was the end. 
 So invite all your family and friends 
 Cause there should be a celebration, 
 Let's make the best of this time that we spend, 
 'Cause if this is the end, I want you to 
 Live like you don't plan to wake up (x8) 
 Live it one more time, one more time, 
 Live it one more time, one more time. 
 You've got a problem, this ain't the place 
 You wanna solve it, then we'll reserve a space, 
 You rock with me, I rock with you, 
 Only got one life, you know what to do, 
 So leave your sorrow and your pain, 
 Leave your fortune and your pain, 
 You can leave it all behind 'cause you will never see it again, 
 When you're thinking back to this day 
 I want you to be able to say that you would gladly do it again, 
 Gladly do it again. 
 What if you never see tomorrow again, 
 And this the last party that you attend, 
 Let's live it up like it's 3010 
 What if this was the end. 
 So invite all your family and friends
