Nigga you don't want it 
 'Cause we ain't the one 
 Bad men raised around slum 
 Nigga you don't want illegal alien 
 And I kill people for fun 
 Nigga you don't want it I heard you pack a big gun 
 But when the beef come you run 
 Nigga you don't want it "cause you ain't a gangsta" 
 Said that you don't want it"cause you ain't a gangsta" 
 See when I come through niggas never asking who the fuck's you 
 'Cause they can recognise bad man and crew 
 Bout 50 thugs heat near you to put the dot on your head like a hindu 
 White t's and my chicks rockin' short skirts 
 You can see the handgun through the t-shirts 
 Don't make me change your name to joe dirt 
 'Cause we here to work 
 Nigga think he hard 'cause he pack a lil heat 
 But like the muzik boy you will skip a beat 
 Fuck around with the wrong nigga on the street 
 You will fall asleep neva wake up to eat 
 You don't want it you don't know now 
 Get the hell up off my ground oh 
 Life breaking out the beat on the next light 
 19 gs on the bricks 
 Only if you want it 
 And that's the lowest I go 
 Get a betta price on the tro cause oh 
 Got niggas from state to death row 
 Relaxed and waiting for me to blow 
 Cause you don't need it 
 The kinda drama we bring the one that have your mom hiding 
 Nigga you don't need it 
 And I can see it in your eyes that you ain't no thug fa life 
 Nigga you don't want it 
 'Cause we ain't the one 
 Bad men raised around slum 
 Nigga you don't want illegal alien 
 And I kill people for fun 
 Nigga you don't want it I heard you pack a big gun 
 But when the beef come you run 
 Nigga you don't want it "cause you ain't a gangsta" 
 Said that you don't want it"cause you ain't a gangsta"
