Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely 
 I have nobody for my own 
 I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely 
 I have nobody for my own 
 I'm so lonely 
 Y'all, this one here 
 Goes out to all my players out there, man, ya know 
 Thay got that one good girl, dawg 
 That's always been there man, like 
 Took all the bullshit 
 Then one day she can't take it no more 
 And decided to leave 
 Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night 
 And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side 
 Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her I was fiennin' 
 So, I had to take a little ride 
 Back tracking on these few years 
 Tryin', figure out what I did to make it go bad 
 'Cause ever since my girl left me 
 My whole life can crash in a moment, I'm so 
 Lonely 
 (So lonely)

 Can't believe I had a girl like you 
 And I just let you walk right outta my life 
 After all I put you through you still stucked 
 Around and stayed by my side 
 What really hurt me is I broke your heart, baby 
 You were good girl and I had no right 
 I really wanna make things right 
 'Cause, without you in my life girl, I'm so 
 Lonely 
 (So lonely)

 Been all about the world ain't never met a girl 
 That can take the things that you been through 
 Never thought the day would come 
 Where you'd get up and run and I would be out chasing you 
 'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be 
 Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see 
 Then the girl of my dreams that made me be 
 So happy but now so lonely 
 Lonely

 (Gone for long)

 So stop playing girl and
