Run so many miles 
 I run 
 I left the others in the dust 
 I know exactly what I want 
 I'll catch up 
 Because 
 Ooh I want you now 
 Want you now now now 
 Feels like I'm off the ground 
 Off the ground ground ground 
 Till I find you I'm never coming down down down 
 Until you're mine I'll be dreaming of you 
 Even with so much to lose 
 Being without you just won't do 
 And since this world is so confused 
 You should know that 
 I'll be chasing you 
 Heading straight to you 
 Till I'm facing you 
 I'll be chasing you 
 Ooh I want you now 
 Want you now now now 
 Ooh I want you now 
 Want you now now now 
 Time 
 I'm always racing time 
 'Cause I forget that you and i 
 Are written in the stars 
 And I can't rest till I'm where you are 
 Ooh I want you now 
 Want you now now now 
 Feels like I'm off the ground 
 Off the ground ground ground 
 Till I find you I'm never coming down down down 
 Until you're mine I'll be dreaming of you 
 Even with so much to lose 
 Being without you just won't do 
 And since this world is so confused 
 You should know that 
 I'll be chasing you 
 Heading straight to you 
 Till I'm facing you 
 I'll be chasing you 
 Ooh I want you now 
 Want you now now now 
 Ooh I want you now 
 Want you now now now 
 I left my doubts in the shadows 
 Threw caution to the wind yeah 
 Finding you somewhere somehow was never a question no 
 Cause while I'm restless searching for you 
 I know you're restless searching for me too 
 I'll be chasing you 
 Heading straight to you 
 Till I'm facing you 
 I'll be chasing you 
 Ooh I want you now 
 Want you now now now 
 Ooh I want you now 
 Want you now now now 
 Run so many miles 
 I run 
 I left the others in the dust 
 I know exactly what I want 
 I'll catch up
