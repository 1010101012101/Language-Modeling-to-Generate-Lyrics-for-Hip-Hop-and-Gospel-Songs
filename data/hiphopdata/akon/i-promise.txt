Akon and Elvis white Yay. 
 Upfront 
 'Cause I promise girl 
 I'm so lost girl without you 
 I'm rapped up in pain 
 I'm going insane, without you 
 I'm so lost girl without you 
 I don't know my name 
 Its just not the same without you 
 Please forgive me, for all the wrongs I've done 
 Saying sorry, girl, is never fun 
 So many things I need to say to U, 
 Well here is where I will start from 
 I'm so (so) lost girl without you 
 I'm rapped up in pain 
 I'm going insane, without you 
 I'm so (so) lost girl without you 
 I don't know my name 
 Its just not the same without you 
 'Cause I love U; na, na, na; I Love U; na, na, na; 
 Baby and only you, I love you; na, na, na; 
 'Cause I love U; na, na, na; I Love U; na, na, na; I 
 Love U; na, na, na and only U 
 Your love means so much honey 
 Without your love I'm so lonely 
 So many reasons you should be my boo 
 One plus one will always equal two 
 I Promise U, I'll be there for U 
 Whether sun or rain or season change 
 I Promise U, I'll be there for U 
 Through your ups and downs, I'll be around 
 'Cause I love U; na, na, na; I Love U; na, na, na; 
 Baby and only you, I love you; na, na, na; 
 I love U; na, na, na; I Love U; na, na, na; and only U 
 I'm so lost girl without you 
 I'm rapped up in pain 
 I'm going insane, without you 
 I'm so lost girl without you 
 I don't know my name 
 Its just not the same without you 
 'Cause I love U; na, na, na; I Love U; na, na, na; 
 I love you na, na, na ilove you Baby and only you, 
 I love you; na, na, na; 
 I love U; na, na, na; I Love U; na, na, na; and only U 
 I'm so lost girl without you 
 I'm rapped up in pain 
 I'm going insane, without you 
 I'm so lost girl without you 
 I don't know my name 
 Its just not the same without you 
 Na, na, na; I Love U; na, na, na;i love you na, na, na 
 I love you Baby and only you, I love you; na, na, na; 
 Na, na, na; I Love U; na, na, na; I Love U; and only U 
 (Fade) I'm so lost girl without you 
 I'm rapped up in pain 
 I'm going insane, without you 
 I'm so lost girl without you 
 I don't know my name 
 Its just not the same without you
