(Feat. Ray L) 
 So soft, and Slow 
 Never knew a girl could be so god damn cool, 
 I know, the way she move got me spendin my *dough 
 And yo, If you would've seen what I seen on that pole 
 Just know, 
 That I was wrong for fallin' in lovee 
 I was wrong for fallin' in love 
 (They always say don't love a ho) 
 I was wrong for fallin' in love 
 (Don't do it yo') 
 I was wrong for fallin' in love 
 (They always say don't love a ho) 
 But I just went against the grade 
 It was a feelin' I can't explain 
 And it felt like harmony 
 Singin' in my face like 
 Diddy-daddy doo-daa-dee 
 I don't want it to ever go away 
 I want it around me every day 
 Singin' in my face like 
 Diddy-daddy doo-daa-dee 
 Look at me, I'm stuck 
 That bobble in my pants got me caught up 
 I never, had no look 
 Thinkin' what the wrong hand got me jumpin' out there 
 With no? *? 
 It's feels so good had me sprung out on this love 
 Now I'm stuck 
 That's what I get for fallin' in lovee 
 That's what I get for fallin' in love 
 (They always say don't love a ho) 
 That's what I get for fallin' in love 
 (Don't do it yo') 
 That's what I get for fallin' in love 
 (They always say don't love a ho) 
 But I just went against the grade 
 It was a feelin' I can't explain 
 And it felt like harmony 
 Singin' in my face like 
 Diddy-daddy doo-daa-dee 
 I don't want it to ever go away 
 I want it around me every day 
 Singin' in my face like 
 Diddy-daddy doo-daa-dee 
 So thick, so rough 
 That oil all over her body stole my heart 
 I'm caught, 
 The way she drop down won't alowe me to close my jobs 
 'Cause I'm, already in love and I knew better from the start 
 Oh No, 
 I was wrong for fallin' in lovee 
 I was wrong for fallin' in love 
 (They always say don't love a ho) 
 I was wrong for fallin' in love 
 (Don't do it yo') 
 I was wrong for fallin' in love 
 (They always say don't love a ho) 
 But I just went against the grade 
 It was a feelin' I can't explain 
 And it felt like harmony 
 Singin' in my face like 
 Diddy-daddy doo-daa-dee 
 I don't want it to ever go away 
 I want it around me every day 
 Singin' in my face like 
 Diddy-daddy doo-daa-dee 
 Ah aahhahAH ah...
