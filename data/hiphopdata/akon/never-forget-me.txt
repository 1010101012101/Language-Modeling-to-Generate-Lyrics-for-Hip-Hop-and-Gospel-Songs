I'm gonna make sure you never forget me 
 Konvict 
 Goin' through these struggles everyday on this pavement 
 In every hood I see 'em doin' the same 
 There's a lotta haters that don't want me to make it 
 All I want is for you to remember my name 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 When I'm dead and gone they're gonna remember me as bein one of the livest 
 Genuine ghetto survivors when they gain terror inside 
 I pop in their mind, a silent killer 
 Straight out the ghetto a grimy nigga 
 My lyrics were potent, my fight was venom 
 I could kill em, when I get in them 
 Niggas never knew what'd hit em 
 Legends 
 For what we done did on these streets 
 And what we done spit on these records 
 Blessin 
 We take 'em and put 'em on beats 
 N we give 'em back no question 
 Grandaddy of th mid-west 
 Crazy Jackson 
 The lyrical serial killer 
 I fell em, the innocent is askin about the mind I master 
 When it comes to the rhyme I'm faster than half of these niggas rappin' 
 When it comes to the grind I'm mashin 
 No time for second chances 
 N when it all goes down and they put me in my grave 
 "Fuck 'em all" across my tombstone and bury me with my? 
 Goin' through these struggles everyday on this pavement 
 In every hood I see 'em doin' the same 
 There's a lotta haters that don't want me to make it 
 All I want is for you to remember my name 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 My reputation is solid gold 
 And my street cred is all polished y'all 
 Known as th little boss hog in the hood 
 Boy in my hood I'm a superstar 
 Niggas in th past try t hold a nigga down 
 But I put in my work and checked it checked it 
 Now these niggas respect it 
 Knowin' I'm th wrong one they wanna mess with 
 From the gutter 
 With my brothers 
 Knowin' on these ghetto streets they don love us 
 Duckin these undercovers 
 These muthafuckers doin' everythin' to try 'n' bust us 
 But these suckas, know they can't touch us 
 They envy deep in they hearts 
 Nigga if they ever try to rush 
 Nigga they know we gon' rip 'em apart 
 Niggas go hard, from th start 
 Nigga this ? is my bodyguard 
 Fuck with mine and I'll charge 
 Little crazy-ass nigga at large 
 Pullin cars, on these lanes 
 Nigga I never let go of my heat 
 Stand up man on his feet 
 Little Lazyie Bone on this beat nigga 
 Goin' through these struggles everyday on this pavement 
 In every hood I see 'em doin' the same 
 There's a lotta haters that don't want me to make it 
 All I want is for you to remember my name 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 What I got to do for you not to forget who bought you with that straight thug spin 
 Sped up a little bit with gangsta talk with that harmony all over it hey! 
 Bones sing, n mixed in with that street talk 
 N then the lazy ? get their creep on 
 N he went home, but it's all good 
 He left the right ones an hes still in th hood 
 Rest in peace, like him when I die I hope they remember me 
 That's why I know I gotta reach you with these beats 
 It's not for nothin' remember the thugs for the songs that we sung 
 N makin' it through that struggle, that struggle 
 It ain't easy believe me, we bleedin believe it 
 Still goin' with that hustle, gettin' stronger so they remember me 
 Goin' through these struggles everyday on this pavement 
 In every hood I see 'em doin' the same 
 There's a lotta haters that don't want me to make it 
 All I want is for you to remember my name 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 So that you'll never forget me 
 Goin' through these struggles everyday on this pavement
