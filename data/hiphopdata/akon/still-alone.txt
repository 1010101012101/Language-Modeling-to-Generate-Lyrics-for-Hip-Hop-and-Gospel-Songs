 Shortie (I've been) tryna feel you out, 
 Let me know what's goin' on, 
 Seems to me that you ain't got no man, 
 'Cause the (love) is always gone, 
 But you keep on tryin' to brush me off, 
 And then you find yourself callin me, 
 But you don't wanna jeopardize what you got, 
 Even though you would rather be with me 
 You got a man, he never home, 
 Pretty little thing cryin on the phone 
 City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone 
 You got a man, he never home, 
 Only stuck around 'cause your love was strong 
 City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone 
 Day by day keep passin you by, got you feelin' like you sittin' on a passenger side, 
 At the booty club getting drunk and high, while your home all alone, cryin wonderin why, 
 Oh no, girl I can't have that, 
 Too cute to be havin' an attitude and all that, 
 When your fallin' down I be the one to grab at, 
 And when your on your feet you go right back yeah... 
 You got a man, he never home, 
 Pretty little thing cryin on the phone 
 City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone 
 You got a man, he never home, 
 Only stuck around 'cause your love was strong 
 City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone 
 'Cause I got nothing to lose and nothing to gain, 
 Got to make up your mind if you want me on your team, 
 You don't want me to stay, you don't want me to leave, 
 But you wanna hug me up until a brother can't breath 
 Like what do you want from me 
 Say you wanna love me but your man's in the way 
 Still what do you want from me 
 I guess I cut it up again and call it a day 'cause 
 You got a man, he never home, 
 Pretty little thing cryin on the phone 
 City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone 
 You got a man, he never home, 
 Only stuck around 'cause your love was strong 
 City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone 
 You got a man, he never home, 
 Pretty little thing cryin on the phone 
 City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone 
 You got a man, he never home, 
 Only stuck around 'cause your love was strong 
 City lights came on and then went off again and your still alone
