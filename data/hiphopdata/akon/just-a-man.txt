I beat you to the punchline 
 Girl I love you 
 Now what we 
 What we gon' do 
 I mean it really 
 When I say I love you 
 Whatever... 
 I will not do 
 'Cause I hear your prayers 
 Late at night when no one's listening 
 Praying I stay the same 
 I'm not your father 
 I won't desert you 
 I'm not your ex 
 Not trying to hurt you 
 I'm just a man 
 Tryna love you 
 I'm just a man 
 Trying to love you 
 Your walls are so impossible 
 I'm tired 
 As I'm climbing 
 They keep on multiplying 
 Everytime there's progress 
 We regress 
 And I'm stressed 
 All I wanna know 
 Is why you can't let it go 
 I'm not your father 
 I won't desert you 
 I'm not your ex 
 Not trying to hurt you (oh no) 
 I'm just a man 
 Tryna love you 
 I'm just a man 
 Trying to love you 
 I'm not your father 
 I won't desert you 
 I'm not your ex 
 Not trying to hurt you (oh no) 
 I'm just a man 
 Trying to love you 
 I'm just a man 
 Trying to love you 
 Cause everything you ever want 
 Is standing right in front of you 
 Everything you ever need 
 I make sure I put by for you 
 And I know you're scared 
 And I've had my days too 
 Let's just face this thing together 
 I'm not your father 
 I won't desert you 
 I'm not your ex 
 Not trying to hurt you (no) 
 I'm just a man 
 Tryna love you 
 I'm just a man 
 Trying to love you 
 Yeah 
 I'm not your father 
 I won't desert you 
 I'm not your ex 
 I will not hurt you 
 I'm just a man 
 Tryna love you 
 I'm just a man 
 Trying to love you 
 Hey 
 Yeah 
 Give me that chance baby 
 I wanna love you 
 Said I wanna love you 
 Let me love you baby 
 Let me love you baby 
 Oh
