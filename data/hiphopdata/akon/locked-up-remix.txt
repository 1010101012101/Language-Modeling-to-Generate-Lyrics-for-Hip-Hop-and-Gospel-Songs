 Locked up, they won't let me out, 
 And I had a long day in court shit stressed me out, 
 Won't gimme the bail they can't get me out, 
 Now I'm headed to the county 
 Gotta do a bid here, I'm used to living luxurious, 
 I don't wanna live here, the walls is grey the clothes is orange, 
 The phones is broke, the food is garbage, 
 A lot a niggas is livin' with these circumstances 
 SP's the same I still murk ya man's, 
 Drug money to rap money work advances, 
 Niggas ran and told that I shoulda murked to Kansas, 
 Nigga got popped for a murder attempt 
 Knocked me on de block when I was burning the hemp, 
 Had a brick in the stash hope they don't take to a further extent, 
 Locked up and they won't let me out, 
 When I hit my cell block, niggas know to get me out. 
 (Akon) 
 I'm steady tryin' to find the motive, 
 Why do what I do, 
 Freedom ain't gettin' no closer, 
 No matter how far I go 
 My car is stolen, (stolen) 
 No registration, (registration) 
 Cops patrolling, and now they done stop me, 
 And I get locked up 
 They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out no, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out no, they won't let me out 
 Headin' up town to re-up, (re-up) 
 Back with a couple peeps, (peeps) 
 Corner blocks on fire, (fire) 
 Undercovers dressed as feens (feens) 
 Makin' so much money, (money) 
 Ride up smooth and fast, (fast) 
 Put away the stash, 
 And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up 
 They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (my nigga I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out no, they won't let me out, (I got locked up) 
 They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (baby girl locked up) 
 They won't let me out no, they won't let me out 
 (Styles P) 
 Now that I'm locked up I rep two sets so 
 I'm a ride or die and stay de blocked up 
 Two toothbrushes up, 
 Whoever wanted with P 
 When I walk by nigga get up 
 'Cause I'm locked up they can't get me out, 
 I smoke a stick of haze when they stress me out, 
 Go and hit the bar when the reds be out, 
 Can't wait for the day when they let me out, 
 (Akon) 
 'Cause visitation no longer comes by, (comes by) 
 Seems like they forgot about me, (about me) 
 Commissary is getting empty, (empty) 
 My cell mates getting food without me (without me) 
 Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life, (forward with my life) 
 Got a family that loves me 
 And wants me to do right 
 But instead I get locked up 
 They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (ooh I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out no, they won't let me out, (my nigga I'm locked up) 
 They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (oh oh oh baby locked up)
