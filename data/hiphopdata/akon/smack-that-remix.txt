 Slim Shady 
 I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow 
 Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo 
 Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Taebo 
 And possibly bend you over look back and watch me 
 Smack that all on the floor 
 Smack that give me some more 
 Smack that till you get sore 
 Smack that oh-ooh! 
 Verse 2: (Akon) 
 Shorty if you wanna ride, you can ride on me 
 We can bump heads than collide on me 
 Won't beef damn right, 'can rely on me 
 To bring that Campbell like Naomi! 
 It's cool that girl ain't taking on easy 
 Looking all oiled up and all greasy 
 'Bout that time you stop that teasin' 
 The way you drop! Got me a cheesin' 
 What's funny is that you're taking all my money for real 
 I rather spend it all on you right now than my homie's bill 
 And I can see that's what you're made from, 
 And you never been a lame hoe 
 With that booty bought and paid for 
 Won't move till you're on my payroll 
 I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow 
 Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo 
 Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Taebo 
 And possibly bend you over look back and watch me 
 Smack that all on the floor 
 Smack that give me some more 
 Smack that till you get sore 
 Smack that oh-ooh! 
 Verse 3: (Stat Quo) 
 Yeah! Yeah! 
 Stat Quo! Let's get it! 
 Love when you do it, love move to it, like you used to it drop it down, wanna put my thang to it 
 To the crib we go, go fast and slow 
 Make it twurk like stripper, slide down my pole 
 Shawty *** so swole, got your boy like 'whoa' 
 One night with me, and she wanna marry Stat Quo 
 But I'm like 'no', lets keep it on the low 
 On occasion let me come through and tap that hole 
 Make you lose control, all the girls know 
 That I hit it right, at night I'm a pro 
 I only come 'round to get sexual 
 She flexible and bisexual 
 I might stay around for a longer time 
 Only if, only if she can blow my mind 
 I can hurt that, murk that, work that's fine 
 Now she in love and wants to be mine 
 Stat Quo 
 I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow 
 Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo 
 Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Taebo 
 And possibly bend you over look back and watch me 
 Smack that all on the floor 
 Smack that give me some more 
 Smack that till you get sore 
 Smack that oh-ooh! 
 Verse 4: Bobby (Creekwater) 
 Yeah, Bobby Creek... 
 Know what I'm sayin'... 
 The ice in the watch reflects the light to her 
 The money quite green, and the ice light blue-er 
 The sweat might kill her 
 So I say goodnight to her 
 She don't want me to leave 
 I can see right through her 
 So we... dipped out, burn, one trip, out 
 Get low like Caribbean limbo 
 Then you go out like light 
 Baby girl get right 
 Head so swole, my hat don't fit right 
 We can cruise in the car or we can take flight 
 The middle of the night 
 Make your body act like Mike Vick against the Eagles 
 Call myself a King 'cause I'm Regall 
 To be this hot it's not legal 
 But we don't care listen baby it's a fact that 
 If you drop back, ima quaterback sack that 
 We can go deep and I can shark attack that 
 Say you don't remember where your keys and your hat at? 
 I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow 
 Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo 
 Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Taebo 
 And possibly bend you over look back and watch me 
 Smack that all on the floor 
 Smack that give me some more 
 Smack that till you get sore 
 Smack that oh-ooh!
