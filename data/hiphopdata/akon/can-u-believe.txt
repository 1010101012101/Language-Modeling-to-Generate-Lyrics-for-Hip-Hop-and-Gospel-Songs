Used to be a mess 
 Be so stressed 
 How could I've allowed myself to go there 
 Spread my love 
 And spread my will till there wasn't enough left for myself 
 Then I realised that no one alive would care for me the way I would do 
 (Gotta learn myself) 
 Just a matter of time 
 You find yourself searching back something inside 
 You always knew 
 Can you believe 
 My heart is healed after all its taken 
 Can you believe 
 My heart is healed after so much breaking 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) to give it all I got 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) to give it all I got 
 I know there will be days where things will not go my way 
 And I know, that giving up ain't in my taste 
 'Cause I've always stood by what I've always known 
 Streghth at the side will make this strong 
 You decide to look who you be in love 
 Be in love oh yeah 
 Then I realised that no one alive would care for me the way I would do 
 (Gotta learn myself) 
 Just a matter of time 
 You find yourself searching back something inside 
 You always knew 
 Can you believe 
 My heart is healed after all its taken 
 Can you believe 
 My heart is healed after so much breaking 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) to give it all I got 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) to give it all I got 
 In life there's so much to provide 
 Too much to sacrifice that its crazy 
 But I learn to accept and forgive 
 Ooh yeah 
 Then I realised that no one alive would care for me the way I would do 
 (Gotta learn myself) 
 Just a matter of time 
 You find yourself searching back something inside 
 You always knew 
 Can you believe 
 My heart is healed after all its taken 
 Can you believe 
 My heart is healed after so much breaking 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) to give it all I got 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) yes I'm ready 
 (I'm ready) to give it all I got
