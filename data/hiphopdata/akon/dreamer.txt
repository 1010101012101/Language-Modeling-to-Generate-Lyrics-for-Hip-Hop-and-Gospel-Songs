Maybe I'm just a dreamer 
 'Cause this woman is a keeper 
 Got me feeling like I need her 
 Every day I'm getting weaker 
 Baby, I'm just a dreamer 
 'Cause this woman is a keeper 
 Got me feeling like I need her 
 Every day I'm getting weaker 
 Maybe I'm just a dreamer 
 'Cause this woman is a keeper 
 Got me feeling like I need her 
 Every day I'm getting weaker 
 Baby, I'm just a dreamer 
 'Cause this woman is a keeper 
 Got me feeling like I need her 
 Every day I'm getting weaker 
 Maybe I'm just a dreamer 
 'Cause this woman is a keeper 
 Got me feeling like I need her 
 Every day I'm getting weaker 
 Baby, I'm just a dreamer 
 'Cause this woman is a keeper 
 Got me feeling like I need her 
 Every day I'm getting weaker 
 When you're lonely just give me a call 
 My love or my homie, we can share it all 
 Always been there for me, we witnessed it all 
 And we plan to be till eternity 
 Maybe I'm just a dreamer 
 'Cause this woman is a keeper 
 Got me feeling like I need her 
 Every day I'm getting weaker 
 Baby, I'm just a dreamer 
 'Cause this woman is a keeper 
 Got me feeling like I need her 
 Every day I'm getting weaker
