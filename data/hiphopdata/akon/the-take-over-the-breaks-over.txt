Chip 
 Testing one, two, three 
 Testing one, two, three 
 Testing one, two, three 
 Baby seasons change but people don't 
 And I'm always there waiting in the back rooms 
 Boring but overcompensate 
 With headlines and flash flash, photography 
 But don't pretend you ever forget about me 
 Don't pretend you ever forget about me 
 Wouldn't you rather be a widow 
 Or a divorcée? 
 Style your wake for fashion in magazines 
 I said a widow 
 Or a divorcée? 
 Don't pretend 
 Don't pretend no 
 We don't fight fair 
 They say your head can be a prison 
 Then these are just conjugal visits 
 'Cause people will disscuss us till it doesn't mean a thing anymore 
 So don't pretend you ever forget about me 
 I said now don't pretend you ever forget about me 
 Now wouldn't you rather be a widow 
 Or a divorcée? 
 Style your wake for fashion in magazines 
 I said a widow 
 Or a divorcée? 
 Don't pretend, don't pretend, oh 
 We do it in the dark 
 With smiles on our faces 
 We're dropped and well concealed 
 In secret places, woah 
 We do it in the dark 
 With smiles on our faces 
 We're dropped and well concealed 
 In secret places 
 We don't fight fair 
 We don't fight fair 
 'Can't face no fight fair 
 We don't fight fair 
 So don't pretend you ever forgot about me, oh 
 Don't pretend you ever forgot about me, baby 
 Don't pretend you ever forgot about me, baby 
 Don't pretend you never, you never, you never we... 
 Do it in the dark 
 With smiles on our faces 
 We're dropped and well concealed 
 In secret places, woah 
 We do it in the dark 
 With smiles on our faces 
 We're dropped and well concealed 
 In secret places, woah
