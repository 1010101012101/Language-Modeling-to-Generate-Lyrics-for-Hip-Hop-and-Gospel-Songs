I'm like a bird amd I aim so high in my lear lookn' at the blue sky can't let another day pass by without doin' what I feel inside cause its embedded in my soul day I stop will be the day I turn cold let you know I'm breaking outta that hole and let go so I can be free to do what means to me and you can look back one day and know I shared with you my kid I hope you wouldent think id just leave pack up and roll up my sleeve give it all up and leave with nothing and take with me all I got to give 
 That's why... 
 I just wanna make you clap again 
 Clap again 
 I just wanna make you clap again 
 Clap again
