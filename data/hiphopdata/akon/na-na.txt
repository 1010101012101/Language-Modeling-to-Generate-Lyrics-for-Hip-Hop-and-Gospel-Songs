(Intro/Verse1) 
 It's been so long, 
 That I haven't seen your face, 
 I'm trying to be strong, 
 But the strength I have is washing away. 
 It won't be long, 
 Before I get you by my side, 
 And Just hold you, tease you, squeeze you, tell you what's been on my mind.

 Girl I know, mistakes were made between us two, 
 And We showed, 
 Our eyes that night, even said somethings weren't true, 
 Why'd you go? 
 I haven't seen my girl since then, 
 Why can't it be the way it was, 
 Cause you were my Homie, lover, and friend...
