1 2 3 can you hear me! 
 Your daddy was a real nigga 
 Real rolling stone of our time 
 He's the reason why you wanna be a killer 
 Still wondering why he left you behind?! 
 Now you a blood or crip so ain't you 
 Fuck that nigga, this my clip that's the motto 
 Living the life and hoping that you make it bigger 
 Either you end up in the cage or in the ground 
 Oh just like your daddy, guess you'll just end up just like you 
 Oh you're living on the edge and you know that you gotta 
 Burn this bridge down if you're falling across it 
 Burn this bridge down like you're a plane in this ... 
 Put your lighters up oh 
 Let it burn let it burn let it burn 
 Put your lighters up oh 
 Let it burn let it burn let it burn 
 That bridge 
 Your momma used to be a hooker 
 So many men coming in and out the house 
 She's the reason why you're working as a stripper 
 On your knees picking dollars of the ground 
 No way you'll rustle for that money 
 Ain't attractive 
 That's little B, Lindsay Lohan, Kardashian 
 You ain't gonna get any surgery on your figure 
 They'll only bring the wrong daddy for your child 
 Ooh oh oh 
 You're just like your momma and 
 Your daughter will be just like you 
 Ooh oh oh 
 You know you're living on the edge and you know that you gotta 
 Burn this bridge down if you're falling across it 
 Burn this bridge down like you're a plane in this ... 
 Put your lighters up oh 
 Let it burn let it burn let it burn 
 Put your lighters up oh 
 Let it burn let it burn let it burn 
 That bridge 
 Let it burn let it burn 
 Find another way to the other side 
 Let it burn let it burn 
 We'll make it to the top even we have to climb 
 Let it burn let it burn 
 Our kids are counting on us to stay around 
 Let it burn let it burn 
 Put your lighters up oh 
 Burn that bridge down 
 Burn this bridge down if you're falling across it 
 Burn this bridge down like you're a plane in this ... 
 Put your lighters up oh 
 Let it burn let it burn let it burn 
 Put your lighters up oh 
 Let it burn let it burn let it burn 
 That bridge
