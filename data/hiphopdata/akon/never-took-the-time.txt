A moment ago it seemed 
 It was yesterday 
 You were here with me 
 And everything seems to be the same 
 What am I supposed to do 
 With all these empty rooms? 
 Sit here in solitude 
 With the smell of your perfume? 
 You never took the time to know me 
 You never took the time to understand 
 You never took the time to know me 
 'Cause lovin' you was all I ever had 
 'Cause lovin' you was all I ever had 
 This wasn't what I wanted to be 
 A man in misery 
 Girl I look back a thousand times 
 I can't believe that you left me (Why you leave me baby) 
 Why can't you understand my pain 
 How can I explain 
 Girl I don't know what I'm doin' wrong 
 I can't believe that your love is gone 
 'Cause you never took the time to know me (said you never took the time to know me) 
 You never took the time to understand (oh oh oh) 
 Said you never took the time to know me (said you never took the time to know me) 
 'Cause lovin' you was all I ever had (had) 
 Lovin' you was all I ever had 
 You're all I need, you're all I see 
 And I wish that we could do it again! 
 'Cause you never took the time to know me (baby you never took the time to know me) 
 You never took the time to understand (oh oh oh) 
 Said you never took the time to know me 
 Because of you, now I'm just a lonely man 
 Because of you, now I'm just a lonely man
