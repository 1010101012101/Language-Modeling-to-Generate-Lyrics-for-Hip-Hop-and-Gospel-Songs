My binoculars on 
 Alone staring out of my window 
 I see the best creation of woman that I ever saw in a long, long time 
 Some say it is wrong 
 But what if she knows that I am spying on her 
 Would she strip down naked and entertain me 
 Oh my god she's doing it 
 Taking it off 
 Taking it off 
 Taking it off 
 Taking it off 
 Taking it off 
 She's getting naked 
 She's getting naked 
 She's getting naked 
 She's getting naked 
 She threw her shirt (off on the floor) 
 Then threw her bra (off on the floor) 
 The threw her skirt (off on the floor) 
 Then threw her drawers (off on the floor) 
 I can't believe (she's getting naked) 
 I can't believe (she's getting naked) 
 I can't believe (she's getting naked) 
 I can't believe (she's getting naked) 
 I'm wanting her (off on the floor) 
 Get on top of her (off on the floor) 
 No stopping her (off on the floor) 
 She knows I'm watching her (off on the floor) 
 I can't believe (she's getting naked) 
 I can't believe (she's getting naked) 
 I can't believe (she's getting naked) 
 I can't believe (she's getting naked)
