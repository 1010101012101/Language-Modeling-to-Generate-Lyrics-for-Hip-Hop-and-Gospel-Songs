I don't care what they say baby I'm gon b with u 
 Out in hawaii that's becuse I will always stay tru 
 Because ur my one girl that makes my head swril 'cause I'm in love with u 
 Baby can't you see this is the way it was supposed to be 
 It not that hard its easy as one two three 
 Just say that you love me 
 'Cause baby this is my sunny day just listen to what I say 
 I don't want to be on the block no more havin' to hear about people that got sprayed 
 So baby no more delay this is my sunny day who wouldve though that I would see this day know I hope for everyday until we pop champagne 
 'Cause not a damn thangs changed except me I don't know if that was the way it was supposed to be but I do know one thing 
 Just listen to what I sing 'cause I lonve you more than everything 
 All we got to do is hop on the plane and goto hawaii 'cause 
 Can't you see that's the way it was supposed to because you mean more than me than I think you can see 'cause you saty right next to my heart and I thought about you while I was in the dark but know this is my sunny day but ima keep it on the low 'cause I don't give a fuck what the industry say this is my sunny day
