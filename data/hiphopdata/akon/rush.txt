 Hey-Aye! 
 Upfront, Konvict 
 Hey-Aye, Ooh Yeaa! 
 (Akon) 
 I gotta find a way to get outta here x2 
 This ain't the way that I wanna live, no 
 This ain't the way somethin' gotta give 
 In a rush, rush (gotta keep on movin') 
 I'm in a rush, rush (gotta keep on movin') x3 
 (Akon) 
 'Cause I find myself on the fast track side to life, drivin' me crazy 
 In the hood daylight to night and you can find me grindin' daily 
 And it ain't gon' change as long as we getting money keep the same mind frame 
 Same hood, betta pop that thang, same big whip on the block same fly dame 
 Wit my lady just rollin', with the sunshine and the wind blowin' 
 Gotta keep my mind cleared from all this crime hopefully one day learn from it, but 
 (Akon) 
 I gotta find a way to get outta here x2 
 This ain't the way that I wanna live, no 
 This ain't the way somethin' gotta give 
 In a rush, rush (gotta keep on movin') 
 I'm in a rush, rush (gotta keep on movin') x3

 Girl, it's like I can't see the sun, six in the mornin' I'm still on the run 
 Day to the night rushin' around town tryin' to get this done for the case come down 
 Gotta feed my fate, face to face with no place to race except straight 
 I can feel them close on my heels, gotta keep goin' so I'm takin' the wheel 
 Tryin' to outrun my fears, outrun my pears, outrun the killers and escape them years 
 Yet again, so I take out my pen and say "If you find this letter please pray for me"

 I gotta find a way to get outta here (x2) 
 This ain't the way that I wanna live, no 
 This ain't the way somethin' gotta give 
 In a rush, rush (gotta keep on movin') 
 I'm in a rush, rush (gotta keep on movin') (x3) 
 (Akon) 
 Now can you picture me growin' up on the bad side of town 
 Where them outlaws are hangin' out all the women get down 
 Where cash moneys the only answer to problems around 
 And if ya missin' your people most likely they underground 
 This cruel world, this cruel world 
 Leave this town forever, break away and just start err 
 (Akon)
