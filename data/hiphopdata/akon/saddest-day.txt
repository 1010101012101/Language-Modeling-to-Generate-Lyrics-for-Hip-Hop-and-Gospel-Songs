Going crazy 
 Heart Is breaking 
 I... can't... sleep at all 
 Tryna get through this 
 Don't know how I'll do this 
 I... know... that I only got myself to blame (only got myself to blame) 
 But that doesn't help to ease the pain (doesn't help to ease the pain) 
 Ill just die if I can't see her face 
 Until ya come back 
 I can't breath 
 Until ya come back 
 I got no reason 
 Got my heart my heart down on its knee's 
 I still need you beside me... 
 Now its morning 
 Your still gone and 
 I... still... reach for you (still reach for you) 
 Don't know how to 
 Live without you 
 I... wish... I can take back all the hurt I cause 
 If I can Take back all the love I lost 
 My pain is just took higher because Yeah 
 End: 
 Pleaseeeee... forgive me 
 Let me have 
 One more chance 
 In your life 
 Till you're with me 
 I'll be 
 Half alive 
 Until ya come back 
 'Cause I need you beside me...
