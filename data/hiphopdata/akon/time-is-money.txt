Akon: 
 I'm gonna give you one minute 'cause, you trippin' 
 Too much time in your hand, you slippin' 
 Why you focused on all of this dealin' 
 Them ni***s coming in through the back door, stealin' 
 Crib on the hill, now that's good livin' 
 Harder to reach when you make your first mil in 
 So much money, gotta stack to the ceiling 
 And I'm gonna keep doing this forever, god willing 
 Real ni***s like me don't catch feelings 
 Only broke niggas be out there grinin' 
 Say you gettin' money but you ain't even tippin' 
 The big booty girl in front of you, dippin' 
 Fronting like you really doing all that shippin' 
 Man you gotta be, gotta be kiddin' 
 Don't even try 'cause my weapon is hidden' 
 My ni**a Dru ready to do some killin' 
 I'ma tell you just one time 
 Give me what's mine 
 'Cause I don't have time to waste 
 Out here on my grind 
 Money on my mind 
 And I won't stop gettin' paid 
 Living this life of mine 
 I don't really know 
 If it really got what it takes 
 Hustlin' is in my blood 
 It just won't go away 
 Time, money (8X) 
 Ni**a with money 
 Don't have no time 
 Ni**a with time 
 Don't have no money 
 Kon Live in one year made millions 
 Everybody got money 
 Ni**a we chillin' 
 But ain't go no time 
 It's a bad feelin' 
 Especially when you want a lil sexual healin' 
 A girlfriend's pullin' 
 A family's pullin' 
 In every direction everybody need money 
 My lifestyle redefine how they all livin' 
 If I keep it up, I'll be broke in a minute 
 My kin folks in the block 
 And they dealin' 
 All my goons still off they killin' 
 Man I be runnin' got no time to be skippin'
