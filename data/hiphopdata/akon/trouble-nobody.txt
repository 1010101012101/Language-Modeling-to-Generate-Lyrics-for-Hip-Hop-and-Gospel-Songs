Ok, Akon, Stay outta trouble now son 
 Akon, Stay outta trouble now son 
 Let me tell you what hurts the most 
 I'm a convicted felon and I can't work 
 No matter where I go and try to get paid 
 They never give me a good job 'cause they are afraid 
 That I'ma stick 'em up, oh yes stick it 
 Rob the manager and everybody in it 
 That's the everyday life of a convict 
 Tryin' to make it, why their saying to me... 
 The judges said don't trouble nobody 
 Probation said don't trouble nobody 
 Stay outta trouble don't trouble nobody 
 And I'ma try not to trouble nobody 
 Me an' my niggas on the block all day 
 Blocking dimes, lookin' out for police 
 Cause this the type of shit that we go through 
 Up in the ghetto just to make some cheese 
 The street type got me gettin' locked up 
 About 5-6 times a week and then I make mon' 
 Take it from the profit of the weed 
 All this just to feed my seeds (yeah) 
 I gotta stop this livin' 
 I witness one too many killings 
 I don't seen the hardest nigga street talk to the clown 
 That was never ever found, so... 
 I'm trying to stay away from trouble everyday 
 But its hard when the things you need 
 Picture lookin' at your babies in the face 
 When they hungry and they need to eat 
 I'm tryin' not to do wrong 
 But they won't let me do right 
 Even tho I done changed my life 
 Criminal records' what they judging me by, that's why... 
 My mama said don't trouble nobody 
 My papa said don't trouble nobody 
 Stay outta trouble don't trouble nobody 
 And I'ma try not to trouble nobody 
 (So I won't trouble nobody) 
 The judge said don't trouble nobody 
 (Can't trouble nobody) 
 Probation said don't trouble nobody 
 (Won't trouble nobody) 
 Stay outta trouble don't trouble nobody 
 (Won't trouble nobody) 
 And I'ma try not to trouble nobody 
 (So I won't trouble nobody) 
 My mama said don't trouble nobody 
 (Can't trouble nobody) 
 My Papa said don't trouble nobody 
 (Won't trouble nobody) 
 Stay outta trouble don't trouble nobody 
 (Wont trouble nobody) 
 And I'ma try not to trouble nobody (yeah)
