You will, be missed, by all your fans 
 I clenched, my fists, but this' so hard to withstand 
 If I had the power to change one thing, I'd bring you back today 
 But life's not promised and that won't change, I'm'a meet you there some day 
 In this lifetime I wonna thank you, for showing me the man in the mirror 
 In this lifetime I wonna thank you, you motivated the whole world to deliver 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 There's so much joy in our heart 
 Oh I wish, the world could see you the way I did 
 And I wish, they witnessed how a wonderful dad you were to all your kids 
 And I noticed it didn't stop there, saving children was one of your goals 
 Just donating all of your millions, so they could one day rule the world 
 In this lifetime I wonna thank you, for showing me the man in the mirror 
 In this lifetime I wonna thank you, you motivated the world to deliver 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 There's so much joy in our heart 
 One word for the media, please help the people see the love 
 Stop this garbage you're feeding us, show him for what he really was 
 Remember there was more to come, remember he's the chosen one 
 Remember he's the wisest one, remember him for what he's done 
 Remember him for what he's done, remember him for what he's done 
 In this lifetime I wonna thank you, for showing me the man in the mirror 
 In this lifetime I wonna thank you, you motivated the world to deliver 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 We cry out of joy (for you) 
 There's so much joy in our heart 
 Rest in peace and harmony, Michael. I love you, man.
