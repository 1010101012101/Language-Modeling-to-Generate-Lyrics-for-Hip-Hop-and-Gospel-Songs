Oh Africa... 
 I know that we have to take it to the goal 'cause everyone's depending on we 
 See we ain't got nowhere to go but up, it's our destiny 
 We're choosing the way, we'll do what it takes to get to the top of the highest mountain 
 We'll do anything, we got to prove ourselves 'cause we know 
 Oh Africa... 
 See we'll never be able to forget this day 'cause it's the greatest day of our life 
 See no matter what happens at least we can say "we came, we saw, we tried" 
 We're choosing nowhere, we'll do what it takes to get to the top of the highest mountain 
 We'll do anything, we got to prove ourselves 'cause we know 
 Oh Africa... 
 This is our time to shine, our time to fly, our time to be inside the sky 
 Our time to soar, our time to saw, the last one in football 
 Oh Africa...
