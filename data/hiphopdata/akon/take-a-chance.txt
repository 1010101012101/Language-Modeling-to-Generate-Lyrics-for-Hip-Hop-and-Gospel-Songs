Are you ready? 
 Party people, are you ready? 
 I never felt so alive, like I do tonight. 
 Said, I never felt so alive, like I do tonight. 
 Look at her, look at her. 
 A couple more drinks then she's ready, (then she's all mine.) 
 Look at her, look at her. 
 A couple more drinks then she's ready, (then she's all mine.) 
 This could be the only time, I stand at the borderline, 
 I'm ready to take my chances, what I do is not a crime. 
 It's just to have a good time, I'm ready to take my chances. 
 Whoa, Hey! 
 Lets put it all on the line, tonight! 
 Whoa, and leave our worries behind, tonight! 
 You ready? I'm ready, then lets have some fun. 
 Tomorrow, tomorrow, it may never come. 
 This moment, this moment, is right in our hands. 
 So lets take a chance. 
 I've never felt so alive, like I do tonight. 
 It's like once in a lifetime. 
 I've never felt so alive, like I do tonight, 
 It's like once in a lifetime. 
 Look at her, look at her. 
 A couple more drinks then she's ready, (then she's all mine.)
