 I can't go know where 
 Unless your by my side 
 I gotta have you here 
 Right here by my side 
 Can't roam the town 
 Unless your by my side 
 Gotta have you around 
 Right here by my side 
 (Trazz) 
 Ok 
 See heres some things I'm tryin' to say dyin' to say 
 I keep real with you ain't no crime today 
 See I been thinkin' about it all day 
 In brod day 
 How you stuck with me and been by my side like an entray before imma give you diamonds like kanye 
 Nuttin less then 3000 like andre 
 And when I come home sick you always stay up with the light on for the kid like motel sex 
 Never think about flowin with this 
 Callin it quits 
 So I can't give a damn about these hotel chicks 
 Comming at me like a linebacker blitz and that don't me shit but keep a close snitch to get hitch like will smith (so uh) 
 You blowin' my ways and all the things I hate about you you would be willing to change we was in the right lane the way this smash was made so there ain't a damn thing I'm willin' to change this my stand 
 (Akon) 
 I can't go know where 
 Unless your by my side 
 I gotta have you here 
 Right here by my side 
 Can't roam the town 
 Unless your by my side 
 Gotta have you around 
 Right here by my side 
 (Trazz) 
 Yeah 
 Listen 
 We go together like coffee and cream 
 Water and steam 
 As long as your supporting your dream it's your team 
 When I'm done you be keeping me up like caffine 
 So as long as money is green your all I need 
 And I don't know what I've done to deserve it cause you always keep my head above water like a life preserver 
 So I buy you ruggs and purses just to give worser 
 And we prey for life situations where it determines 
 Chicks holla but they all about the dollars 
 I never bothered you were here when I started it 
 And you been making it clear how to still support the kid when you have your own career when like anything 
 We been through up and downs hand and hand and can't imangine me going through what I did without you here (uh uh) 
 So I promise you bearts as a man you can have the world when its in the palms of my hands 
 (Akon) 
 I can't go know where 
 Unless your by my side 
 I gotta have you here 
 Right here by my side 
 Can't roam the town 
 Unless your by my side 
 Gotta have you around 
 Right here by my side 
 (Trazz) 
 Yeah 
 Now baby tell me wats good wat you love 'cause we were goin' through out trials like a city court judge 
 Givin' all 
 And my life right here in front of this judge so my goons out 
 Problems here give me slugs 
 'Cause I hate to keep you waitin but things are so close right now I can taste it 
 And you gonna see it all shopping sprees and vactions so if you eva left I would never find a replacement 
 (Akon)

 Gotta have you around 
 Right here by my side... right here by my side
