Wish I can keep you much longer 
 I know you gotta go, cause you got thangs to do 
 Wish I can keep you much longer 
 Now you too busy for me, girl like I was to you 
 Wish I could just stop by, and maybe say hi 
 Wish I could just stop by, and lay by your side 
 Wish I could just stop by, and maybe say hi 
 Wish I could just stop by, and lay by your side 
 The tables have turned, and I've finally learned 
 That this is makin-up for every day I was gone 
 That's why I'm concerned, but now must confirm 
 That you spread your wings, and learned to fly with all the load 
 Darkness in the night, I'll find that light for you 
 As long as I got eyes, I'll have a sight for you 
 As long as I'm alive, baby I'll die for you 
 Wanna be with you 
 Wish I can keep you much longer 
 I know you gotta go, cause you got thangs to do 
 Wish I can keep you much longer 
 Now you too busy for me, girl like I was to you 
 Wish I could just stop by, and maybe say hi 
 Wish I could just stop by, and lay by your side 
 Wish I could just stop by, and maybe say hi 
 Wish I could just stop by, and lay by your side 
 Your always on my mind, 
 While I'm racing, while I'm paper chasin, 
 You were there when I said one day I get up out that basement 
 Playin' as my agent, for you there is no replacement 
 You will always be my girl, they can quote me on that statement 
 Darkness in the night, I'll find that light for you 
 As long as I got eyes, I'll have a sight for you 
 As long as I'm alive, baby I'll die for you 
 Wanna be with you 
 Wish I can keep you much longer 
 I know you gotta go, cause you got thangs to do 
 Wish I can keep you much longer 
 Now you too busy for me, girl like I was to you 
 Wish I could just stop by, and maybe say hi 
 Wish I could just stop by, and lay by your side 
 Wish I could just stop by, and maybe say hi 
 Wish I could just stop by, and lay by your side 
 Baby I know you, and how we do 
 Doing exactly what I taught you 
 Gotta get that money first before you 
 Come spend that precious time with your boo 
 And I know what I got, just take it 
 Even You was driving me crazy 
 Always want to see my girl naked, but lately 
 Chorus - 2x's 
 Wish I can keep you much longer 
 I know you gotta go, cause you got thangs to do 
 Wish I can keep you much longer 
 Now you too busy for me, girl like how I was to you 
 Wish I could just stop by, and maybe say hi 
 Wish I could just stop by, and lay by your side 
 Wish I could just stop by, and maybe say hi 
 Wish I could just stop by, and lay by your side
