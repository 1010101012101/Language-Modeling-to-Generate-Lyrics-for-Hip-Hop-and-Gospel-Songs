 I was riding down the turnpike (PIKE) and I got stopped 
 By a Jersey State Trooper type cop (COP) 
 Proceeded to pull over (OVER) showed him my credentials 
 Cause searchin my car just wasn't subsequential 
 He took the route like most cops do (DO) 
 Harassin a black man like Little Boy Blue (BLUE) 
 But I kept cool (COOL) 'cause I got style (STYLE) 
 And because I knew, that in a little while

 Bein a bold black Brownsville Brooklyn boy (BOY)

 'Cause I shun the ho-hum and mash the mall (MALL) 
 And no need to take time to stake me out (ME OUT) 
 'Cause I'll beat your pee out and take the clout (CLOUT)

 When you're in the hood you hear the same old sound (SOUND) 
 Old school beats meetin new school rhymes (RHYMES) 
 And styles, evolutin all the time (TIME) 
 And no-no, a badge can't move the crowd (CROWD) 
 And neither can a nightstick, that ain't slick (SLICK) 
 But Ed makes beats like a bulletproof vest (VEST) 
 Give it to me, and I'll do the rest (AND I'LL DO THE REST)
