To me I just feel like this new law is a sign of hatred 
 You know 
 It should be called the go back to Mexico law 
 They say we the people, but who are the people 
 Basically to me we the victims 
 You know 
 I feel like it's bush again 
 Even colder power 
 Dear jan brewer 
 Dear joe arpaio 
 It's time we fight back 
 Ok to break they jaw 
 'Cause they ain't fightin fair 
 Ok to break the law 
 My fellow mexicans 
 You know I got you back 
 Welcome to our world 
 They did it to the blacks 
 They did it to the natives 
 I'm just statin facts 
 They did it to the jews 
 They did it to iraq 
 Our state is full of shit 
 That's why it's full of gangs 
 When I say full of shit 
 I say john mccain 
 Land of the free 
 Home of the slaves 
 Latinos work the hardest 
 And they ain't gettin' paid 
 But since nobody care 
 That nigga bush is out 
 And a recession's here 
 Oh now let's push 'em out 
 Back to Mexico 
 That's what the law says 
 But deep down inside 
 They want us all dead 
 It's racial profiling 
 The devil's steppin in 
 Welcome to arizona 
 But don't be Mexican 
 That's why I say we march 
 That's why I say we fight 
 'Cause even malcom x 
 Was tired of being nice 
 They say we the people 
 But who are the people 
 'Cause y'all the one's illegal 
 I'll shoot that fuckin' eagle 
 Yeah I love my country 
 But we the one's killin' 
 But what we dying for 
 Let's ask pat tillman 
 Back to Mexico 
 That's what the law says 
 But deep down inside 
 They want us all dead 
 That's why I say we fight 
 It's not a pillow fight 
 It's like bill o'reilly 
 Just want the bill of rights 
 Back to Mexico 
 That's what the law says 
 But deep down inside 
 They want us all dead 
 That's why I say we fight 
 It's not a pillow fight 
 It's like bill o'reilly 
 Just want the bill of rights 
 I didn't bring the races 
 I just brought the mirror 
 I just brought the truth 
 I just make it clearer 
 Don't wanna help the homeless 
 Don't wanna heal the sick 
 But just harass the people 
 Who help build this shit 
 Barrack where you at 
 The white clown house 
 Move to arizona 
 Live in a brown house 
 Live in a black house 
 Next to the crack house 
 Oh yeah bring the sheriff 
 I bring the facts out 
 They beat michael johnson 
 And that's my fuckin' uncle 
 And he the city council 
 He gotta stay humble 
 But I say rumble 
 I call it legal drama 
 'Cause ev'rybody know willy non a mexicano 
 That's why it's personal 
 I'm comin' out with cleats 
 When I say arizona 
 I'm talkin' 'bout the streets 
 Phoenix sun jersey 
 Wearin a los shirt 
 Back to Mexico 
 Let's see who do the work 
 Back to Mexico 
 That's what the law says 
 But deep down inside 
 They want us all dead 
 That's why I say we fight 
 It's not a pillow fight 
 It's like bill o'reilly 
 Just want the bill of rights 
 Damn 
 And they say it ain't racist 
 But got the right to 'port all the people by faces 
 And they say it ain't wrong here 
 But if he say no ingles 
 He don't belong here 
 Damn 
 Is that what y'all tellin' me 
 'Cause I'm cool with dude 
 I just got a felony 
 But y'all cool with bush 
 And he did it all 
 United we stand 
 Together we fall 
 Damn 
 And barrack ain't save us 
 They gave us barrack to continue to play us 
 Ugh, and I can see through the walls now 
 Need to go to city hall 
 And try to tear the walls down 
 Back to Mexico 
 That's what the law says 
 But deep down inside 
 They want us all dead 
 That's why I say we fight 
 It's not a pillow fight 
 It's like bill o'reilly 
 Just want the bill of rights 
 Back to Mexico 
 That's what the law says 
 But deep down inside 
 They want us all dead 
 That's why I say we fight 
 It's not a pillow fight 
 It's like bill o'reilly 
 Just want the bill of rights 
 Y'all go head and join the military
