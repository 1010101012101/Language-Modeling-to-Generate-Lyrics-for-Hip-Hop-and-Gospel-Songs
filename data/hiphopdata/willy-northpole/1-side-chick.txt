Y'all gota feel me on this one 
 Girl we done been through it 
 I like to call her like, Like my numba one sidechick 
 But she cool with it though 
 Yeah 
 I don't care what nobody say 
 She gona ride For Me 
 She used to get jelous 
 And try to be demandin' 
 I didn't want a family 
 And now she understand me 
 She used to wana fight me 
 She wanted to be wifey 
 She tried to leave me for that lame but he wasn't like me 
 Then she came back 
 And we set the rules 
 If I can have a girl 
 Then you can have a dude 
 And now we both cool 
 And she my ride or die 
 And with a chick like that bet cha boy can fly 
 Sex feelin' good 
 My little toy friend 
 It's kind of like my girlfriend got a boyfriend 
 My little secret weapon 
 She know when to check in 
 If I tell her she will leave dat in a second 
 I know that homie love her 
 So dude can keep her 
 I'll never be committed 
 So it's rude to sweep her 
 It's like us against the world when we under covers 
 I try to front but I love her 
 Chorus Bobby v: 
 I don't care what the people may say

 And I know she gone ride 
 Even though I got chicks on the side she my nigga for life 
 [3x] But that's my baby 
 And I know she gone ride on me 
 [4x] She ain't goin' no where 
 She's my number one girl

 Bobby v: 
 The streets been telling me 
 That chu been doin' this, and doin' that 
 But its irrelevant, because I know that you always got my back 
 My sunshine on a rainy day 
 Unlike the weather you never change 
 'Cause you're my boo, and ima never ever leave you 
 She my girl/homie if I lose her ill feel like a dead homie 
 She love me without the bread on me 
 I cuff her like dickies, I sneak her over for a little quickie, no evidence with no hickies 
 Text me when he sleepin' I write back you crazy, she write LOL I just miss you baby 
 My number one chick, in the draft she my number one pick 
 Especially on some 101 ish 
 I'm her number one daddy, yeah he make her happy, but the eyes don't lie I know she wish she had me 
 It's like us against the world when we under covers 
 I try to front but I love her 
 Chorus Bobby v: 
 I don't care what the people may say

 [3x] But that's my baby 
 And I know she gone ride 
 Even though I got chicks on the side she my nigga for life 
 [3x] But that's my baby
