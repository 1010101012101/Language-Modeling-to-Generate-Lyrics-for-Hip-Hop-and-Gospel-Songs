Feeling down, down, it's all oh-oh-ver 
 Heading down, down, down 
 Heading down, down, down 
 I just can't get over 
 Simple little fact the the love is over 
 I thought me and you was gon' get older 
 And then go half on a baby and mold her 
 I thought I was gon' always hold ya 
 Even though we constantly fought like soldiers 
 Together we supposed to fall down like boulders 
 But ever since the weather been gettin' colder 
 We're lookin' for closure, 'cause we couldn't stay in love 
 'Cause we both miserable in love 
 And I'm even worse without you 
 I walked away and I'm feeling down, down (it's all oh-oh-ver) 
 But even if I stayed I'd be feeling down, down, down 
 But even if I stayed I'd be feeling down, down, down 
 This situation, needs a brand new configuration 
 Baby take a look at our relationship, it's sittin' on a rocky foundation 
 And that's why conversations are confrontational 
 And cause frustrations, the cause of our separation 
 Is a culmination of complications, 
 And that's why we gotta quit the love 
 'Cause we both miserable in love 
 And I'm even worse without you 
 I walked away and I'm feeling down, down (it's all oh-oh-ver) 
 But even if I stayed I'd be feeling down, down, down 
 But even if I stayed I'd be feeling down, down, down 
 It's over, it's over 
 It's over 
 I don't know where I should go, backwards or forwards now 
 I don't know what I should do, feelin' lonely or be with you 
 I heard this on another song, you don't know what you got till it's gone 
 You don't know what you got till it's gone, don't know what you got 
 We gotta quit the love 
 'Cause we both miserable in love 
 And I'm even worse without you 
 I walked away and I'm feeling down, down (it's all oh-oh-ver) 
 But even if I stayed I'd be feeling down, down, down 
 But even if I stayed I'd be feeling down, down, down 
 At a higher pitch 
 At a higher pitch 
 At a higher pitch 
 Oh, it's over 
 It's over 
 Don't shed a tear for me, it's over 
 Don't shed a tear, although it's over
