Will.I.Am: 
 We get messed up waiting for the party 
 Turned up, hotel lobby 
 Fast life like a Ducati 
 Spending money like I'm from Saudi 
 Bagging babies with them bare bodies 
 See me cooling with the black barbies 
 I got brand 'cause you a smarty 
 And now I'm feeling like la-ri-da-di 
 Wait a second, wait a minute 
 I don't think you're ready for it, hey 
 Party like a fool, baby 
 I don't need to train for it 
 Drinking over liquor, and I even paid for it 
 Any second, any minute 
 We about to send a course 
 Pia Mia: 
 The girls wanna play with boys 
 And the boys wanna play with girls 
 And the girls wanna play with girls 
 Boys wanna play with boys 
 So boy don't you love with world? 
 The girls wanna play with boys 
 And the boys wanna play with girls 
 And the girls wanna play with girls 
 Boys wanna play with boys 
 So boy don't you love with world? 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh... 
 Hey 
 Will.I.Am: 
 Baby we don't stop, and we don't quit 
 In the club like we own it 
 Too legit, up in it, and so lit 
 Oh my god, oh my goodness 
 Feel good, 'cause I'm sipping on goodness 
 Two drinks got too fist 
 Three chase got you for six brands, hey 
 Wait a second, wait a minute, I'll take you to the next level, hey 
 Turn up the base, turn up the tre-treble 
 Party like an animal, party like a re-rebel 
 Any second, any minute, we about to get in trouble 
 Pia Mia: 
 The girls wanna play with boys 
 And the boys wanna play with girls 
 And the girls wanna play with girls 
 Boys wanna play with boys 
 So boy don't you love with world? 
 The girls wanna play with boys 
 And the boys wanna play with girls 
 And the girls wanna play with girls 
 Boys wanna play with boys 
 So boy don't you love with world? 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh oh 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh... 
 Hey
