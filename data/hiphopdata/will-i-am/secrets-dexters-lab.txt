I got a secret formula 
 It's got a little bit of high and a little bit of low 
 I got a secret formula 
 It's a little bit of high and a little bit of low 
 I got a secret formula 
 It's just a little bit of high and a little bit of low 
 I got a secret, so keep it on the low 
 Never tell ya make sure nobody know because 
 In my lab I got fist 
 In my lab I got rhymes 
 In my lab I got funk in my lab 
 You can smell it when before you stepped in my lab 
 So loud make a brotha go deaf in my lab 
 The mad scientist I'm straight mad in my lab 
 Blowin' up... like Baghdad in my lab 
 Spies try to spy try to see up in my lab 
 Now private eyes hound while I be up in my lab cause 
 I know something that I can't tell 
 Won't find out 'cause I keep it so well 
 You can bang on my head till my head swell 
 I got a new formula I can't tell

 It's got a little bit of high and a little bit of low

 It's a little bit of high and a little bit of low 
 I got a secret formula 
 It's just a little bit of high and a little bit of low 
 I got a secret, so keep it on the low 
 Never tell ya make sure nobody know because 
 In my lab I got beats 
 In my lab I got feet 
 In my lab they try to creep in my lab 
 Conspiricists try to find out secrets to the lab 
 But information won't leak 'cause I keeps it in the lab 
 Top security so thieves can't nab 
 No way to obtain, no way to have 
 You can't grab on to what's not possible 
 Why risk your life going through these obstacles 
 Don't even try to get it 
 Don't even try to get it 
 A lotta people attempt it, but they gotta get it 
 And when they gotta get it, yo the secret's hidden 
 That's just the way the song's written, bro
