 (Bomb-BOMB, bomb-bomb) 
 Bring it here, bring it here, make it clear, make it clear yeah 
 [Supernatural] (will) 
 It's hip-hop, it's real hot (real hot) 
 The way we control it, it's like Cyclops (Cyclops) 
 It's all locked (all locked), it don't stop (don't stop) 
 It's so funky that I keep it in a Ziploc (keep it funky) 
 It's too ill (too ill), 'cause we real real (yeah, yeah) 
 Yo, I hooked up with my little pah ill will (Yo wassup?) 
 And he rock that (rock that), with a format (format) 
 Plug it in now I make the go-to-war rap 
 Where the boys at? 'Cause they all bore (all bore) 
 Another point for the B Boyz has been scored (that's right) 
 I'm a MC (MC), not a fake cat 
 Yo, I'm quick with the mental nice wit rap 
 Yo, it's a gift, yeah when I spit (when I spit) 
 Yo I'm pimpin' like Gladys Knight and the Pips 
 Yo I never slip, 'cause it's super hot 
 You could say, yeah, that we got to locked, c'mon 
 (Chorus: will.i.am) 
 (Bomb-BOMB, bomb-bomb)

 (Bomb-BOMB, bomb-bomb) 
 D-R-O-P all them bombs 
 (Supernatural) 
 He wan' go and never stoppin' it (stoppin' it) 
 And off of the top right now, yo, he's droppin' it 
 It's like grease in the skillet, yo, I'm poppin' it 
 Fryin it, yo, layin it and poppin' it (p-p-p-poppin' it) 
 And if you've never had it before, please try it, kid 
 Because, once you get it, you'll love it a little bit 
 And once you, do it a little bit a lot of it 
 I told you before this the way we droppin' it 
 C'mon fifty bars, I'm a superstar 
 You can see me on the Ave., in a super car (vroom vroom!) 
 Yo, I put it down, and I wear a crown 
 All the people in the city, please gather round 
 Whether LA (LA), or even New York (New York) 
 Anywhere I go I live it like a rhyme sport 
 Off of the top you know that it's ill lettin me rock 
 Like I told you, it never do stop, c'mon 
 [Supernatural] (will) 
 Real nice, on the mic device 
 Yo I said it once, don't make me say it twice 
 Yo I said it once, don't make me say it twice 
 (Aiyyo 'Nats, smooth it out like if you Zima on ice) 
 Yo it's real ill, and you know that 
 Every time I do it pah, it's a Kodak 
 You can say I'm old school, I'm like a throwback 
 For all the little children out there didn't know that 
 Oh open up, and let me come on in 
 Because once I do it, you want me to do again 
 I told you, you can go just tell a friend (tell a friend) 
 I'm nice with the freestyle and the pad and pen (pen) 
 I'ma make my ends (make my ends), I'ma get my cheese (get my cheese) 
 Never heard lyrics that work quite like these (these) 
 Stop drop and freeze (freeze), fall to your knees (knees) 
 Yeah, if you think you're beatin' me, nigga please~! 
 Told you before, this is the art of war 
 I say I swoop down on the party like a preda-tor 
 Yo, somebody call The Source edi-tor ('tor) 
 And tell 'em give me mics, give me four, give me more 
 Oh do it ill, yo we make you bounce 
 I rock so many microphones I can't even count 
 Off th, e top of the dome, any place that I go 
 I've mastered the lyrics and damn I'm tight with the flow, whoa
