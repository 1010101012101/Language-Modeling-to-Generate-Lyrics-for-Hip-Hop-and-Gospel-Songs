(Jennifer Lopez - Hook) 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard... 
 (Will.i.am) 
 Imma go hard, hard to the core 
 Hard like hard like liquid shwartz 
 Harder than worldwide stadium tours 
 I am the future, delorian doors 
 Will he survive? Never deceased 
 I don't think I'mma ever rest in peace 
 Imma kill the game, leave the rest in pieces 
 Now everybody want my recipe 
 Tell a jealous chicken I don't know what the beef is 
 I'm just making money for my grandkids' nieces 
 Imma work hard, that's my basis 
 40 are dashin', screechin' 
 Pardon me ma'am, Imma go dumb 
 Smart.i.am, I'm complicated, hard.I.am 
 I end the beginning, then starting again 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard... 
 (Will.i.am) 
 You can get that, or you can get this 
 You can call a demon, Imma call Jesus 
 You can get a curse, you can get a cross 
 You can go to work, or you can be the boss 
 Imma be the owner, like Jerry Jonesa 
 You can go harder, you can go homer 
 Imma make the beat put the people in a coma 
 You can be a geek or be a rolling stoner 
 I woke up in the morning, 
 Hard like morning wood in the morning 
 Woke up thinking about microphonin' 
 E.T own the mic phone to Homeland 
 I'm way out like NASA 
 I'm way over here I done passed ya' 
 I get stacks of cash, you get cashews 
 I go hard, statues 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 Now let me take this time to say 
 I don't wanna lead you on 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 Well I, I know it is a lot to take 
 I don't wanna lead you on 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard 
 Wait a minute, Imma make it a little harder 
 Imma make it a little harder 
 Give it to you a little harder 
 This... is hard... 
 (Mick Jagger) 
 Hard like a rock 'n' roll 
 Time follows decades, explode 
 Baby this is dynamo 
 Better move back now 
 It's about to blow 
 Hard like geometry 
 And Tech-a-nology 
 This is crazy 
 Psychology 
 Yeah, baby 
 I'm bout to win 
 Watch out now 
 I'm going in 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard or you can go home 
 You can go hard
