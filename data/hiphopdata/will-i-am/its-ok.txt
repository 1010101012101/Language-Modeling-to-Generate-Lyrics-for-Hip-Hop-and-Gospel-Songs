We're goin' out to the club tonight 
 Let Fli Fat Funk Playa frost your ice 
 Got a Zima in the cup and I'm feelin' all right 
 Got it poppin' on the dance floor, do what you like 
 Gotta scoop me up one of these hotties 
 Come on here, baby, give me that body 
 You ain't never met a brother like Ronnie 
 Or had fun with a player like Commie 
 Ooh, girl I like the way you move 
 Let me whisper in your ear and get close to you 
 And tell you things to get your mind off dancing 
 I know you ain't came here just to be dancin' 
 Your booty lookin' like a big old fruit 
 Walk with me, talk with me, have a seat in a booth 
 You here with your girl? I came with my homey 
 I know a spot we can go to that's more cozy 
 Tell me why these people so damn nosey 
 Oh, I know why, cause you so fly 
 Brothers sayin' I wish I was that guy 
 Heads turnin' every time that you walk by 
 But enough of all the egos strokin' 
 I'm already pressin' you, I got you open 
 I love a women and he's here to get naughty 
 And gotta head to give but let me see you put it on me 
 It's okay, if you wanna leave here 
 It's okay, we don't gotta be here 
 It's okay, this show we thug up 
 It's okay, that's what's up 
 Gotta scoop me up one of these hotties 
 Come on here, baby, give me that body 
 You ain't never met a brother like Ronnie 
 Or had fun with a player like Commie 
 I ain't the kid up in the club to be dancin' 
 Unless they got a break beat on, other than that, I'm relaxin' 
 I press a chick that's fly like Toni Braxton 
 That'll get me off of the wall, like Mike Jackson 
 One up on you grabbin' you up, without askin' 
 Spittin' game to you, wassup, ma with the action 
 Niggas lame to you wassup, ma, what's crackin' 
 Let's get the party started, after the party yells, after the party yells (after the party) 
 You ain't never met a player like Donnie, or a brother like Commie 
 Or Hans Solo, I'd a roll with the army 
 Got a room on the strip, meet me back in the lobby 
 You got me feelin' aroused 
 I ain't tryin' to sex you on the dance floor, cause that ain't my style 
 Triple Seven laid back, I ain't no youngster 
 Fire for ya fire if I don't, then why don't you 
 It's okay, if you wanna leave here 
 It's okay, we don't gotta be here 
 It's okay, this show we thug up 
 It's okay, that's what's up 
 Gotta scoop me up one of these hotties 
 Come on here, baby, give me that body 
 You ain't never met a brother like Ronnie

 Hey girl, you know you got it goin' on 
 Hey girl, you go girl 
 So cute, shakin' in your boots 
 Gettin' loose in the clubs till the club 
 Blowin' smoke out a stretch Escalade roof 
 Let's ride, just me and you 
 Whatcha wanna do? Holla at ya boy 
 Make you hotter than a fat kid in corduroys 
 I'm tellin' you ma, the real, I ain't an act 
 I work the back better than a chiropractor 
 Triple Seven, remember this image 
 It's all hunky dory, just don't catch feelings 
 It's okay, if you wanna leave here 
 It's okay, we don't gotta be here 
 It's okay, this show we thug up
