Great times are coming, 
 Coming down the boulevard, 
 Coming down your avenue, 
 I can see it from a bird's eye view. 
 Great times are coming, 
 Coming to your ghetto, too, 
 Coming down the avenue, 
 I can see it form a bird's eye view. 
 Here come the good times, 
 Let the good times just roll in, 
 We ain't got no time to be slowing 
 Bring 'em on, bring the good times 
 Let the good times just roll in, 
 We ain't got no time to be slowing, 
 Bring 'em on, bring the good times. 
 I'm fired up and ready to go, 
 Lit the fuse, I'm about to blow, 
 On the top, come from below, 
 Plant the seed, imma watch it grow. 
 Got big dreams like Dr King, 
 Big things to the extremes. 
 I'm a tech feme, check scheme, 
 Knowledge up on the steam steam 
 Bread the stack, president's black, 
 Came for the hood, now I'm headed back. 
 Get my people off the track, 
 Get my people out the track. 
 (Pre-Hook) 
 We're saying ay-o, 
 If you buy that bush get out my way-o 
 I'm about to do it, do it big, that's the way it go, 
 Cause baby, I just wanna live my life. 
 Great times are coming,

 I hope you're ready, 
 Great times are coming. 
 I hope you're ready, 
 I see them coming around. 
 I hope you're ready, 
 Great times are coming. 
 I hope you're ready, 
 I see them coming around.
