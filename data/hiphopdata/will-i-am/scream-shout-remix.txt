(Intro - Diddy) 
 It's like shit is coming down from the motherfuckin' heavens 
 It's a new motherfuckin' day 
 Get down or lay down 
 Ay yo, turn the fuck up 
 Ay yo, fuck sparklers 
 I wanna see flamethrowers in this motherfucker 
 This a will.i.am joint 
 Hit-Boy, Britney, Waka, Weezy 
 And they call me Diddy bitch 
 (Bridge - Hit-Boy) 
 Where 1 Oak at? Where Darby at? 
 If you at Greystone gettin' your drink on, tell 'em to run this back 
 Put your hands up in the air, got the call from will.i.am 
 Now it's Hit-Boy on a hit boy 
 You turned up and I'mma bring the action 
 (Hook 1 - Britney Spears (Diddy)) 
 When you hear this in the club 
 You're gonna turn this shit up (turn up bitch) 
 You're gonna turn this shit up (turn up bitch) 
 You're gonna turn this shit up (turn up bitch) 
 When we up in the club 
 All eyes on us (turn up bitch) 
 All eyes on us (turn up) 
 All eyes on us (let's rock) 
 See the boys in the club 
 They watching us

 Everybody in the club 
 All eyes on us

 (Hook 2 - will.i.am) 
 I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out 
 And scream and shout, and let it out 
 We saying, oh wee oh wee oh wee oh 
 You are now, now rocking with 
 Will.i.am and Britney, bitch 
 (Verse 1 - will.i.am) 
 It's rock and roll, roll 
 Whole world know my shit everywhere I go 
 Whole world bang this song 'cause it's cold 
 Ah, shit, I think that girl ready to go off 
 But she want a photo - so I took a photo 
 Yeah, I took a picture with an I'm photo social 
 Yeah, you got a cold chick, but I got a colder hoe 
 She don't really know shit, so I gotta show her 
 Hide your paper, yeah I'm stackin' paper 
 Money to the ceiling, now I need a skyscraper 
 You are now, now rockin' with 
 Will.I.Am and Britney, bitch 
 Wack Flocka Flame, Lil' Wayne, Hit-Boy, Diddy, bitch 
 (Hook 3 - will.i.am)

 Motherfuckers I said put your hands up 
 Turn the fuck up right motherfuckin' now 
 (Verse 2 - Wack Flocka Flame) 
 Oh, it's time to party 
 Oh, it's time to party 
 Smokin', drinkin', no passin' out 
 YOLO, I'mma shout it out 
 We party hard, we yell it out 
 Disrespect me, knock him out 
 Crack a smile, Pacquiao 
 Fuck the VIP, I'm in the crowd 
 Me and Britney, we actin' wild 
 It's Waka Flame, you know my style 
 This little chain like 40 thou 
 All eyes on me, look out 
 Pop a beam, that's the old me 
 Molly's here, we don't fight fair 
 My buzz big, like Lightyear 
 Get a grip, shorty, you can't stand here 
 Friends, fans and family here 
 Outfit real, live with no fear 
 Turn the club into a mosh pit 
 Spend 20 bands, do a back flip 
 Girl, drop it low, shake that 
 My wrists rocky like A$AP 
 This a G mix and I laced that 
 (Hook 4 - Britney Spears (Diddy)) 
 When you hear this in the club 
 You're gonna turn this shit up (turn up bitch) 
 You're gonna turn this shit up (turn up bitch) 
 You're gonna turn this shit up (turn up bitch) 
 When we up in the club 
 All eyes on us 
 All eyes on us 
 All eyes on us 
 (Verse 3 - Lil' Wayne) 
 Hi! I'm Tunechi - I give the girls my room key 
 Money can't buy you love, so I don't pay for no pussy 
 I don't pay these haters no mind - don't fuckin' call me cheap 
 I grab life by the horns, and that bitch went "beep-beep" 
 I swear right now I feel like 'Pac - 'cause all eyes on me 
 And I don't mean to throw no Sour D's, lookin' small fries to me 
 And my bitch bad like Britney, but I wish I had Britney 
 She remind me of my jeep, but I got a bad memory 
 And I'm feelin' good, I'm lookin' good, I'm smokin' good, I'm sippin' 
 These hoes think they classy? Well that's the class I'm skippin' 
 Got a party in my bedroom, that's a party she ain't missin' 
 I brought her by will.i.am, but she kept callin' him William 
 Only God can judge me, case closed 
 I've got my hoes at Drake shows 
 I got this shit on lock, no escapin' those 
 And I'll make that bitch scream, and shout, and let it all out 
 I'll put it in her backyard like a fuckin' doghouse - Tunechi! 
 (Hook 5 - will.i.am (Lil Wayne)) 
 Scream and shout, and let it all out (yeah, yeah) 
 And scream and shout, and let it out (yeah) 
 We saying, oh wee oh wee oh wee oh 
 We saying, oh wee oh wee oh wee oh 
 (Outro - Diddy) 
 Let's go 
 This is the remix 
 This is a super black man remix 
 This is the remix 
 This is a super black man remix 
 This is a super black man remix 
 Yeah 
 And they call me Diddy bitch 
 Yeah 
 Scream and shout 
 And turn them all out 
 Yeah
