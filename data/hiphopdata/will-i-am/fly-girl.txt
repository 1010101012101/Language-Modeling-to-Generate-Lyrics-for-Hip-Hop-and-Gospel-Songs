I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody 
 I don't want nobody, nobody but you, babe 
 I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody 
 I don't want nobody but you 
 It's all so clear, clear to me now 
 It gotta be your class, your style, and your smile 
 'Cause sun ain't shinin', shinin' when you gone 
 All I get is rains, all I get is storms 
 'Cause it's nothin' I could do and nothin' I could say 
 'Cause I know coulda, woulda, shoulda asked you to stay 
 Steal me for life, make you my wife 
 But my ego had me bonded and I couldn't see the light 
 Love is complicated only when you fightin' 
 Love is at its base when you touchin' like Midas 
 And it's that simple, simple as can be 
 I'm the only one for you, you the only one for me 
 Now, you see it takes two, two time's the charm 
 And this time around we gon' form a strong bond 
 And together we could soar, soar to whatever 
 And I never leave you 'cause forever is forever 
 Pretty girls that be comin' around 
 I wanna let you know, I'll be turnin' them down 
 'Cause I don't want no other ladies 
 Tellin' me they love me 
 Pretty girls that be comin' around 
 I wanna let you know, I'll be turnin' them down 
 'Cause I don't want no other ladies 
 Tellin' me they love me 
 I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody 
 I don't want nobody, nobody but you, babe 
 I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody 
 I don't want nobody but you 
 Baby, you a fly girl, fly girl 
 Fly girl, fly girl, fly girl, fly girl 
 I want you to be my girl, my girl 
 My girl, my girl, my girl, my girl 
 Ooh yeah, baby, you a fly girl, fly girl 
 Fly girl, fly girl, fly girl, fly girl 
 I want you to be my girl, my girl 
 My girl, go girl, go girl 
 I'll be reminiscin', think about the moments 
 Spend alone for hours while we sittin', talkin', holdin' 
 Connected conversations infectin' are relation 
 Our chemistry will bubble up that tingling sensation 
 You're teasin', blowin' me kisses, I play and call you missus 
 I missed the way you hug me when you whisper in your wishes 
 I never meant to hurt you, I hope you know I'm sorry 
 Together we could bring a happy endin' to the story 
 All we need is trust, just another chance 
 A little bit of luck in romance to advance 
 I'll be your knight in shinin', you'll be my silver linin' 
 A good relationship is precious like a diamond 
 And I never let you go 
 And I wanna let you know that I'm open up to grow 
 And together we could flow, flow to whatever 
 And I never leave you never 'cause forever is forever 
 Pretty girls that be comin' around 
 I wanna let you know, I'll be turnin' them down 
 'Cause I don't want no other ladies 
 Tellin' me they love me 
 Pretty girls that be comin' around 
 I wanna let you know, I'll be turnin' them down 
 'Cause I don't want no other ladies 
 Tellin' me they love me 
 I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody 
 I don't want nobody, nobody but you, babe 
 I don't want nobody, I don't want nobody 
 I don't want nobody but you 
 Baby, you a fly girl, fly girl 
 Fly girl, fly girl, fly girl, fly girl 
 I want you to be my girl, my girl 
 My girl, my girl, my girl, my girl 
 Ooh yeah, baby, you a fly girl, fly girl 
 Fly girl, fly girl, fly girl, fly girl 
 I want you to be my girl, my girl 
 My girl, go girl, go girl 
 Pretty girls that be comin' around 
 I wanna let you know, I'll be turnin' them down 
 'Cause I don't want no other ladies 
 Tellin' me they love me 
 Pretty girls that be comin' around 
 I wanna let you know, I'll be turnin' them down 
 'Cause I don't want no other ladies 
 Tellin' me they love me
