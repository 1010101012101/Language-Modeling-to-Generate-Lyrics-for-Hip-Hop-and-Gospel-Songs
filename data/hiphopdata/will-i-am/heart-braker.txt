Look Out 
 Look Out 
 Look Out 
 Where it's at, 
 I know Karmas comin' to pay me back, 
 I hurt the sweetest thang that's on the map, 
 I broke her heart in 30 seconds flat, 
 In 30 second flat 
 How did I, 
 Just how did I become that kinda guy, 
 To look at girl and lie right in the eye, 
 My mama told me "willy that ain't right, 
 Boy now that ain't right" 
 I'm s-s-s-sorry, 
 I'm s-s-s-sorry, 
 I didn't mean to break your heart, 
 I didn't mean to break your heart, 
 I'm s-s-s-sorry, 
 I'm s-s-s-sorry, 
 I didn't mean to brake ya, 
 B-b-break it, look baby 
 I'm a Heart braker, I'm a Heart braker 
 I'm a Heart braker, I'm a Heart braker 
 I'm a Heart braker, I'm a Heart braker 
 I'm a Heart, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a Heart, 
 I'm I'm I'm a, 
 Where she go?, 
 I got some things I gotta let her know, 
 To fix the love now its impossible, 
 But maybe baby if we take it slow, 
 If we take it slow, 
 We could make it work, 
 We just can't leave the love right down in the dirt, 
 You probably think I'm a ******* jerk 
 'Cause of the way I let you down, it made you hurt, 
 I didn't mean to make you hurt, 
 I'm s-s-s-sorry, 
 I'm s-s-s-sorry, 
 I didn't mean to break your heart, 
 I didn't mean to break your heart, 
 I'm s-s-s-sorry, 
 I'm s-s-s-sorry, 
 I didn't mean to brake ya, 
 B-b-break it, look baby 
 I'm a Heart braker, I'm a Heart braker 
 I'm a Heart braker, I'm a Heart braker 
 I'm a Heart braker, I'm a Heart braker 
 I'm a Heart, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a Heart, 
 I'm I'm I'm a, 
 Lets brake it down (X3) 
 I'm s-s-s-sorry, 
 I'm s-s-s-sorry, 
 I didn't mean to break your heart, 
 I didn't mean to break your heart, 
 I'm s-s-s-sorry, 
 I'm s-s-s-sorry, 
 I didn't mean to brake ya, 
 B-b-break it, look baby 
 I'm a Heart braker, I'm a Heart braker 
 I'm a Heart braker, I'm a Heart braker 
 I'm a Heart braker, I'm a Heart braker 
 I'm a Heart, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a Heart, 
 I'm I'm I'm a,
