(Feat. Faith Hill, Seal, Mary J Blige, Bono) 
 (Will.i.am) 
 From Delaware to Tennesse to Hawaii 
 From mountain tops 
 We have dreams from sea to shining sea 
 And now here we are 
 (Faith hill) 
 We have come 
 We have prevailed 
 Who so ever dreamed, this is your will 
 Here we are 
 Here we are 
 (Seal (faith hill)) 
 At the dawn, 
 At the morning 
 Of a brand new day (a brand new day) 
 For all (for all) 
 In the spirit of our fathers 
 (Seal, faith hill, will.i.am) 
 America 
 America 
 America is beautiful (beautiful, yes it is) 
 My America 
 Your America 
 Our America is beautiful 
 (Seal, faith hill) 
 And may God (may God) 
 Keep us together 
 Cause America (America) 
 Is beautiful (beautiful) 
 (BONO) 
 May liberty and justice ring for all 
 Let your dreams stand tall 
 May opportunities fall upon you 
 In the land of the free 
 Mary j. blige 
 We have come 
 And we have prevailed 
 Who so ever dreamed, this is your will 
 And here we are 
 Here we are 
 (Bono (mary j blige)) 
 At the stars 
 And the risen 
 Of a brand new day (of a brand new day) 
 For all (for all) 
 In the spirit of the fathers (spirit of the fathers) 
 (ALL)
