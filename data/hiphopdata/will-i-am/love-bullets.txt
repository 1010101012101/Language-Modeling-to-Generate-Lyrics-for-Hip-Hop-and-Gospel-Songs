Skylar Grey 
 Love will be the armor 
 Protect us from the pain 
 Will.i.am and Skylar Grey 
 In our life, in our life. 
 Even when the storm comes, 
 We'll stand out in the rain, 
 Watch it slide, live inside. 
 Here we stand against the world 
 Will.i.am 
 You and I we rock the lullaby 
 Make me feel alive, cause the love will never die 
 Me put you long one, 
 Shot me down and we're gone, 
 Ain't no need to worry, don't call 911. 
 Bang-bang, a lot of bang-bang, 
 Shoot me with your love and got me feeling no pain. 
 Kill it, kill it baby with your love even, bang bang, 
 Baby, do it again. 
 Skylar Grey 
 So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet, 
 Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet, 
 Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it, 
 Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet. 
 So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet, 
 Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet, 
 Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it, 
 Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet. 
 Will.i.am and Skylar Grey 
 Even if you're mad at me 
 And fighting all the time 
 It's all right, it's all right. 
 I would risk my sanity 
 I would lose my mind 
 For one night, for one night. 
 Here we stand against the world 
 Will.i.am 
 You and I we rock the lullaby 
 Make me feel alive, cause the love will never die 
 Me put you long one, 
 Shot me down and we're gone, 
 Ain't no need to worry, don't call 911. 
 Bang-bang, a lot of bang-bang, 
 Shoot me with your love and got me feeling no pain. 
 Kill it, kill it baby with your love even, bang bang, 
 Baby, do it again. 
 Skylar Grey 
 So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet, 
 Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet, 
 Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it, 
 Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet. 
 So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet, 
 Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet, 
 Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it, 
 Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet.
