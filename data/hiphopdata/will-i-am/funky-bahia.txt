 Oh oh oh 
 Lieya lieya lieya lieya 
 Oh oh oh 
 Would you take me out dancing 
 Dancing on the floor 
 I'll be out in Rio 
 Dancing at the disco 
 Girls be lookin' sexy 
 Dressin' mighty fine 
 They be dancing funky 
 Having themself a good time 
 I'll be stepping out 
 To paint the town 
 And party the night away 
 I'll be dancing 
 I'll be grooving 
 And I'm gonna do it 
 'Cause the drummer made me do it 
 Made me do it 
 To the way he plays

 Lieya lieya lieya lieya 
 Oh oh oh 
 Won't you take me to the party 
 Party with the world 
 Dancing in the ghetto 
 Love enough (?) 
 Come on everybody 
 Won't you feel the joy 
 Music is the potion 
 Rock' it from coast to coasting 
 I'll be steppin' out 
 Around the world 
 Washing the pain away 
 You'll be dancin' 
 You'll be groovin' 
 And you can do it 
 'Cause the drummer made you do it 
 Made you do it 
 To the way he plays
