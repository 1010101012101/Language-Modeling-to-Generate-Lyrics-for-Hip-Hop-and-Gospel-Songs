I went to sleep last night 
 Tired from the fight 
 I've been fighting for tomorrow 
 All my life 
 Yeah I woke up this morning 
 Feeling brand new 
 'Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming 
 Has finally came true 
 It's a new day 
 It's a new day 
 It's a new day 
 It's a new day 
 It's a new day 
 It's been a long time coming 
 Up the mountain kept runnin' 
 Songs of freedom kept hummin' 
 Channeling Harriet Tubman 
 Kennedy, Lincoln, and King 
 We gotta manifest that dream 
 It feels like I'm swimming upstream 
 It feels like I'm stuck in between 
 A rock and a hard place 
 We've been through the heartaches 
 And lived through the darkest days 
 If you and I made it this far 
 Well then hey, we can make it all the way 
 And they said no we can't 
 And we said yes we can 
 Remember it's you and me together 
 I woke up this morning 
 Feeling all right 
 I've been fightin' for tomorrow 
 All my life 
 Yeah, I woke up this morning 
 Feeling brand new 
 Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming 
 Has finally came true 
 It's a new day 
 (It's a new day) 
 It's a new day 
 (It's a new day) 
 It's a new day 
 It's a new day 
 It's been a long time waitin' 
 Waiting for this moment 
 Been a long time praying 
 Praying for this moment 
 We hope for this moment 
 And now that we own it 
 For life I'ma hold it 
 And I won't let it go 
 It's for fathers, our brothers 
 Our friends who fought for freedom 
 Our sisters, our mothers 
 Who died for us to be in this moment 
 Stop and cherish this moment 
 Stop and cherish this time 
 It's time for unity 
 For us and we 
 That's you and me together 
 I woke up this morning 
 Feeling brand new 
 Cause the dreams that I've been dreaming 
 Have finally came true 
 Yeah, I woke up this morning 
 Feeling all right 
 'Cause we weren't fighting for nothing 
 And the soldiers weren't fighting for nothing 
 No, Martin was dreaming for nothing 
 And Lincoln didn't change it for nothing 
 And children weren't crying for nothing 
 It's a new day 
 It's a new day 
 It's a new day 
 A new day 
 It's a new day 
 It's a new day 
 It's a new day
