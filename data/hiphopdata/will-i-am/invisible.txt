Now we tried to fix it up 
 But it's too late 
 Lets give up and love 
 No more mistakes 
 Here we go, here we go 
 'Cause you can't see where I'm coming from 
 I feel so invisible 
 My lady got me going crazy 'cause 
 We be having problems and 
 I think that she ready to go away 
 Well she could be happy 'cause 
 We be steady arguing and I can't really take it no more, no no 
 Too much of fussin' and fightin' 
 This used to be so exciting 
 And now it's just not inviting no more 
 Now baby why even bother if we can't help one another over? 
 Now we tried to fix it up 
 But it's too late 
 Let's give up and love 
 No more mistakes 
 Here we go, here we go 
 'Cause you can't see where I'm coming from 
 I feel so invisible 
 She can't see me, hey she can't see me 
 The girl can't see me, no she can't, she can't (I'm invisible) 
 She can't see me, hey she can't see me 
 The girl can't see me, no she can't, she can't (I'm invisible) 
 My lady don't even be listening 
 I be tryna tell her but she said she can't take it no more. 
 Becus she can't really handle it 
 Love is something scandalous 
 I just let her walk out the door, whatever 
 Whatever happened to what meant to be? 
 So why don't we simply 
 Stop playing games mentally? (games, games, games) 
 Whatever we do, we did let's hurry up and just get it over 
 Now we tried to fix it up 
 But it's too late 
 Lets give up and love 
 No more mistakes 
 Here we go, here we go 
 'Cause you can't see where I'm coming from 
 I feel so invisible 
 She can't see me, hey she can't see me 
 The girl can't see me, no she can't, she can't (I'm invisible) 
 She can't see me, hey she can't see me 
 The girl can't see me, no she can't, she can't (I'm invisible) 
 I'm invisible, I'm invisible, I'm invisible 
 I got no visual 
 I be talking she be walkin', walkin' with her eyes closed 
 Trying to get her attention, does she see me? No she don't. 
 I'm invisible, I'm invisible 
 I'd be yelling in her face but she don't even notice 
 I be speakin' she be creepin', creepin' with her eyes closed 
 Check her out, there she go creepin' with her eyes closed 
 But it's too late 
 Let's give up and love 
 No more mistakes 
 Here we go, here we go 
 'Cause you can't see where I'm coming from 
 I feel so invisible 
 Now we tried to fix it up 
 But it's too late 
 Let's give up and love 
 No more mistakes 
 Here we go, here we go 
 'Cause you can't see where I'm coming from 
 I feel so invisible (I'm invisible) 
 I'm invisible...
