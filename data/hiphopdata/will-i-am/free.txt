Get'cha five's, get'cha ten's, get'cha twenties out 
 Get'cha five's, get'cha ten's, get'cha twenties out 
 Get'cha five's, get'cha ten's, get'cha fifties out 
 Get'cha five's, get'cha ten's, get'cha fifties out 
 I'm free 
 I just spent all my money 
 But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing 
 Free 
 Burned a hole in my pocket 
 But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing 
 Call me a perfectionist 
 Addicted to immaculate 
 The hair right, shoes tight 
 Got to look the dress the part 
 With nothin' in my pocket 
 Got a catwalk for a closet 
 On my last lonely dollar 
 Lock me up before I hit the store 
 Wanna be like Midas 
 But my bank account is minus 
 Gotta stretch that dollar bill 
 Stretch that dollar 
 Need a genie in a bottle 
 Change a quarter to a hundred 
 Gotta stretch that dollar bill 
 Stretch that dollar bill 
 I'm free 
 I just spent all my money 
 But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing 
 Free 
 Burned a hole in my pocket 
 But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing 
 I wear it once 
 And I don't pop the tags 
 The next day I'ma bring it back 
 I'm at the store 
 Can't find nothin' cheaper than my credit score 
 My wallet's anorexic 
 Can I pay my rent the next month? 
 I can hear my name 
 Callin' from stilettos on display 
 Window shopping's overrated 
 If I see it, I'ma take it 
 Gotta stretch that dollar bill 
 Stretch that dollar 
 This Vogue is only paper 
 I can't wear the glossy pages 
 Gotta stretch that dollar bill 
 Stretch that dollar bill 
 I'm free 
 I just spent all my money 
 But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing 
 Free 
 Burned a hole in my pocket 
 But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing 
 Get'cha five's, get'cha ten's, get'cha twenties out 
 Get'cha five's, get'cha ten's, get'cha twenties out 
 Get'cha five's, get'cha ten's, get'cha fifties out 
 Get'cha five's, get'cha ten's, get'cha fifties out 
 I need to marry a man from Bel-Air 
 One rack, two rack 
 I can feel the aircraft hangar 
 With my coat hangers 
 Bankrupt, it don't matter 
 Girls give the eye 'cause they so mad 
 I could look fresh in a potato sack 
 Need a overdraft, I'ma overdraft 
 If the bank man calls, just tell him 
 I'm free 
 I just spent all my money 
 But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing 
 Free 
 Burned a hole in my pocket 
 But I rocked that like it don't cost a thing 
 Get'cha five's, get'cha ten's, get'cha twenties out 
 (Burned a whole in my pocket) 
 Get'cha five's, get'cha ten's, get'cha twenties out 
 (I'm free free free free free baby) 
 Get'cha five's, get'cha ten's, get'cha fifties out 
 (I'm free, oh oh oh) 
 Get'cha five's, get'cha ten's, get'cha fifties out 
 (Oh oh) 
 I'm free free, yeah 
 I just spent all my money 
 But I rocked that like it don't 
 Cost a thing 
 Oh, it don't cost a thing 
 Don't cost a thing 
 Yeah, oh oh oh 
 Yeah
