Lord, come down and help us out 
 Send us an angel, help us out 
 S.O.S, help us out 
 Lookin' all the round and I'm watchin' the world 
 People killin', people dyin', people lyin', people blind 
 People don't see the sign, watchin' money all the time 
 Get the pennies, get the dimes, get the dollars is the mind state 
 Of the human race, people on the paper chase 
 The environment is fragile and we been on the gradual 
 Declinin' in a lifetime or lose the battle 
 Get burned by volcanoes, get blown by tornadoes 
 'Cause mother nature signals is tryna warn NATO 
 We got a new terror threat, it's called the weather 
 More deadlier than chemical and nuclear together 
 It's hotter in the winter, even hotter in the summer 
 Jesus or Buddha, somebody come and help us out 
 Lord, come down and help us out 
 Send us an angel, help us out 
 S.O.S, help us out 
 Lookin' all the round and I'm watchin' the world changin' 
 Open up your eyes 
 You can see things rearrangin' 
 The world is dyin' 
 And if they say it's gonna be alright, them people are lyin' 
 People trapped behind the gates, ignorance in their state of mind 
 'Cause they formulate a plan just to penetrate us 
 You see they stimulate us with fear, manipulate us 
 Each year they dominate, dividin' us like calculators 
 And we can't add it up 'cause calculators do the math for us 
 And here they come choppin' down, choppin' down our rainforest 
 Fuckin' up our air for us, they don't really care for us 
 And we can't complain because the only one to blame is us 
 The gas is risin' up but we keep on fillin' up 
 CO2 levels got the whole planet heated up 
 It's blazin' in the winter, even hotter in the summer 
 Muhammad, Jehovah, somebody come and help us out 
 Lord, come down and help us out 
 Send us an angel, help us out 
 S.O.S, help us out 
 Looks like we ain't gon' figure it out 
 Lord, come down and help us out 
 Send us an angel, help us out 
 S.O.S, help us out 
 Lookin' all the round and I'm watchin' the world changin' 
 Open up your eyes 
 You can see things rearrangin' 
 The world is endin' 
 And if they say it's gonna be okay, they just pretendin' 
 When the Eskimo gets bit by a mosquito 
 Somebody in Miami will get swept by a tsunami 
 Rastas in Jamaica will get hit by a quake 
 That registers somethin' like 8.8 
 You see this situations happenin' with our planet 
 'Cause twenty years ago we took it for granted 
 We should have took advantage and reversed the damage 
 Instead of just pumpin' and sellin' and slangin' the gas 
 And while we purchased the gas we was watchin' soap operas 
 While they steady brainwashed the masses 
 'Cause they could make a vehicle that runs off ashes 
 But they don't own a patent for that 
 And that's exactly what's happenin' 
 Corruption and bullshit politics 
 The planet's gonna die 'cause of bullshit politics 
 It's hotter in the winter, even hotter in the summer 
 And ain't nobody comin' to the rescue to help the
