(Yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah... Yeah..) 
 (Intro: will.i.am) 
 Yo, it's the Z-I-M then to the A 
 With Fli, Krondon, and Planet A 
 We gon' rock it all night, then rock it all day, yo 
 (Chorus: Krondon) 
 Don't you act kamikaze (no no) 
 We just came here to party (yeah yeah) 
 Don't make me {*Ooh!*} somebody 
 Ladies getcha money and fellas getcha dough, let's go! 
 (Flii) 
 I guess it's safe to say I feel I'm due for recognition 
 Came a long way from flippin birds in the kitchen 
 All he want is money and a whole lot of women 
 Sixty million cash, broads ass-naked swimmin 
 Been in the win to the end since the beginnin 
 2000 fold back chronic cigarettes sittin' on linen 
 And I'm leeeean-in, Flii's the man 
 My whip navigation's kit, I don't use my hands 
 Now let's dance, that's for all my Knight Rider fans 
 Need help? Filly sekkle, my car drives itself 
 I mastered metaphor till it was mathematics 
 Turn to them oohs to kill a boost sporadic 
 My vocals'll choke you like you actually asthmatic 
 Script writing'll flip like it's acrobatic 
 After I'll rat-tat-tat it out the blab-blabberbox, don't trip 
 My force is centrifugal without Masta Ace's whip 
 (Planet Asia) 
 Beats knock hard, yeah, slappin you cock-eyed 
 We 'bout to bubble up like a bunch of peroxide 
 I eats me spinach 'fore I turn into Popeye 
 A Popeye's opened and I throw up the West Side (West Siiiide~!) 
 Now let's slide y'all, we got bank to get 
 We the Strong Arm Steady Gang, steady man with nothin' 
 But them gangster hits, fresh coast influence 
 We keep it movin in the party like let's do it 
 When my clique walks past the door 
 DUDE, it's somethin' like a fashion show 
 Ask ya folks if age got respect in the streets 
 Up in the club who woulda thought it was my record release 
 Necklace and piece, girl you sittin' next to a beast 
 And if I whisper in your ear, you know my message is deep 
 'Cause I'm a Super Mack, +Big Daddy+ age without the Scoob and Scrap 
 Call me the janitor, I come through scoopin rats 
 Will.i.am, keep comin' with them stupid tracks 
 We blow budgets like whatever, just recoup it back 
 Out for the scratch, a house in the black 
 A yacht and a 'Lac, keep crowds wavin like a stocking cap 
 Think you stoppin' that? Nah, not even hardly 
 But we ain't come to lump you up, we just came to party 
 (Krondon) 
 Krondon tannenbaum, stunt when the camera's on 
 Blunt full of Vietnan, Benz on the autobahn 
 Royalties takin' long, anyway I take it on 
 Will make the beats, make the beats, make the beats 
 Hittin like Sonny Liston {edited} renegade 
 Cadillac sixteen streets down your alleyway 
 Your crew tryin' to do me like Jam-Master Jay 
 But, y'all ain't about ya bih'ness and I can tell 
 Then to warm my vocal chords will clog your senses 
 With South Central's finest lyrics, seein life through the hopest 
 Prayin' they suspend the sentence 
 So major through a ?serum? Vegas sub studios with excitement 
 Body slam beats when I'm writin 
 Prison yard, train hard, words for the spirit 
 Track bumpin, club jumpin', Steady Gang, listen!
