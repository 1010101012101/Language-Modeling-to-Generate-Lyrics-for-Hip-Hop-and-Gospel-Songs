Get your money baby! 
 Get your money baby! 
 Get your money baby! 
 Get your money baby! 
 If you strippin' I ain't trippin' 
 If it's all right with ya, it's all right with me 
 She's a single momma, makin' dollars 
 Cabaret and make you holla 
 Lookin' lovely, day, and nightly 
 Makin' hubbies leave they wifey 
 Homewrecker; heartbreaker; love to shake her money maker 
 She's too sexy for her clothes, so she throws them on the floor 
 She danger, she danger 
 What y'all wanna do, fall in love? 
 She just handlin' business 
 Go 'head girl but don't work your stuff 
 Get your money baby! 
 Get your money baby! 
 Get your money baby! 
 Get your money baby! 
 If you strippin' I ain't trippin' 
 If it's all right with ya, it's all right with me 
 It's all right 
 It's all right 
 It's all right 
 It's all right 
 It's all right 
 It's all right 
 It's all right 
 She's drop dead intelligent 
 Her fragrance is that stripper scent 
 Browses popping to bongo 
 We thongses drop to 
 50 Cent 
 Private dancer, bubble twister 
 Just be glad she ain't your sister 
 Hands off her you can't touch her 
 Fall in love, and she bound to crush ya 
 She danger, she danger 
 What y'all want? She truly hood. 
 She just handlin' business 
 Go 'head girl go (Cut) 
 (Breakdown:) 
 I ain't mad, I ain't mad 
 I ain't mad at ya, I ain't mad 
 'Cause girl you bad, girl you bad 
 You doin' your thang, and your work is this 
 When you work out 
 When you drop your bubble low 
 Girl I'll give it up and I'll clap 
 When you crawlin' on the flo' 
 Girl I clap 
 Get your money baby! 
 Get your money baby! 
 Get your money baby! 
 Get your money baby! 
 If you strippin' I ain't trippin' 
 If it's all right with ya, it's all right with me 
 When you work it, work it, work it 
 Girl when you work it 
 Please don't hurt me, hurt me, hurt me 
 Hurt me, don't hurt me 
 When you drop it, drop it, drop it 
 Pop it and drop it 
 Take it easy, easy, easy 
 Easy, go easy 
 Because you bad girl, bad girl 
 Dynamite (Dynamite) 
 That's right 
 That's right 
 That's right 
 Because you bad girl, bad girl 
 Dynamite (Damn right I'm bad) *echo* 
 Get your money baby! 
 Get your money baby! 
 Get your money baby! 
 Get your money baby! 
 If you strippin' I ain't trippin' 
 If it's all right with ya, it's all right with me
