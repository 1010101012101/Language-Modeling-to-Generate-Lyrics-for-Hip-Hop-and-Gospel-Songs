 Any other way then missionary position 
 And but yo -

 Uh huh uh huh I'm her new nigga now 
 Bank account bigger but that don't mean a thing 'cause 
 My new boo love the way I dig her out 
 Plus she got a job, makin' figures like me, but 
 We ain't really into that, spendin' cash eatin' at fancy little restaurants 
 Motherfuck a restaurant, 'cause 
 We dine in, sip on wine, and get tip sonic and do sex slow like

 Lovely lovin' till the, till the break-break of dawn 
 Do it, do it till we, till we see the, see the sun 
 Six in the morning and we ain't-ain't done!

 So we'll sleep in 
 Till like three in 
 The afternoon, wake up, and do sex slow like
