Make it funky for me

 (Dee-jay...) (She said she said she...) 
 Move it in, check it out, 
 Move it in, check it out 
 Move itttttttt... i-i-i-i-i-i-i-it's - it's 
 It's the funk that make you jump, sexy honeys shake they hump 
 Got them dummies spendin' money just to get up in yo' junk 
 Buy you drinks up at the bar, fill you up with alcohol 
 Why me, boo you, try to do you, even walk you to yo' car? 
 You don't want what's goin' down, you freak them to the sound 
 The bass was steady poundin', you dropped it to the ground 
 Hypnotized by the (dee-jay) when he select the beat 
 Steady rockin' on a (weekday) heavy on repeat 
 So put 'em up, put 'em up, drop it down, to the ground 
 Back it up, back it up, somebody ask the (dee-jay) 
 Could you make it funky for me? 
 Can you make it funky for me? 
 Can you make it funky for me? 
 Can you make the (dee-jay!) 
 Can you make it funky for me? 
 Can you make it funky for me? 
 Could you make it funky for me? 
 Could I ask the (dee-jay!) 
 I make it funky for ya, I make ya feel all right 
 I make it funky for ya, I make ya feel all right 
 Reach for somethin' really high, go ahead and touch the sky 
 Ain't no limit when you in it, live it up 'cause it's yo' life 
 Any minute we gon' spend it like the (shit) never gets spun 
 Oh yeah this (shit) just begun, and we came to have fun! 
 Put away your guns, ladies keep shakin' your buns 
 Some-body grab some-body party till the sun come up 
 And we ain't stoppin', I don't care if 20 cops come in 
 Let 'em keep knockin' and knockin', we keep on rockin' 
 So put 'em up, put 'em up, drop it down, to the ground 
 Back it up, back it up, somebody ask the (dee-jay) 
 Could you make it funky for me? 
 Can you make it funky for me? 
 Can you make it funky for me? 
 Can you make the (dee-jay!) 
 Can you make it funky for me? 
 Can you make it funky for me? 
 Could you make it funky for me? 
 Could I ask the (dee-jay!) 
 I make it funky for ya, I make ya feel all right 
 I make it funky for ya, I make ya feel all right 
 I make it funky for ya, I make ya feel all right 
 I make it funky for ya, I make ya feel al... al... al... al... al... al... al... *echo*
