 I'm making money, 
 Rocking rhymes, 
 Dating honeys. 
 Doing shows around the globe, 
 Limousines on the road. 
 Throwing rhymes up in the air, 
 So they call me Willionaire. 
 I like chicks in fancy fits, 
 And other fo' cover dips. 
 Till the beat rockin' kick, 
 Watch the ladies lick they lips. 
 While I'm rockin' on the mic, 
 Like Jimmy Walker dynamite. 
 Because I like five-foot models, 
 Holding twelve-ounce bottles. 
 They're invited, and I'm excited 
 Just like I won the lotto. 
 Come and dance to my single, 
 After that we gon' mingle. 
 Sweep you off you feet, 
 And play you beats to recite my jingle.

 Can't complain I'm doin' fine. 
 God blessed me with these ryhmes, 
 So just let me blow your mind. 
 I'm a musician, ladies man. 
 Throwing roses to my fans, 
 Yeah, they supporting us they the years. 
 That's enough.

 Fergie-Ferg, apl.de.ap, and my homie Taboo.

 Burning Star, Donny Noga, and that nigger Nyu.

 Yo we stay in California, 
 Makin' beats that you all feelin'. 
 Because I like five-foot models, 
 Holding twelve-ounce bottles. 
 They're invited, and I'm excited
