 When she do the things she do-ooh

 It's lovely, oh it's lovely 
 It's lovely, oh it's lovely 
 Girl look good when she sit 
 Down at the bus stop lickin' on her lips 
 I seen a lot of chicks 
 I gotta admit 
 But you the baddest girl that I seen in a minute 
 You got nice eyes 
 Real nice lips 
 Got a pretty face 
 Tig ol' bits 
 I just wanna pay you some compliments 
 Please don't think that I'm tryna get in it 
 But baby if you wanna gimme a lil' something 
 Here go my number girl call me if you 
 Wanna get to know each other better, if you don't that's cool 
 I just had to come and compliment you 
 Had to let you know you had a beautiful view 
 Your front says uh 
 Your back says ooh 
 There's a million things I can think to do 
 But right now I just want to watch you, just watch you, watch you

 You're just gorgeous so beautiful 
 When God made you, he made you slow 
 He took his little time, plus you were the halo 
 One of a kind you the star of the show 
 Girl you shine, every door you glow 
 You so fine and I know that you know 
 You probably get mobbed everywhere that you go 
 You need a bodyguard 'cause your body like whoa 
 Walk down the boulevard, boys like whoa 
 Walk down the courtyard, boys like whoa 
 If you want a best friend girl let me know 
 If you want a boyfriend here I go 
 I love you, I love you, I love you.
