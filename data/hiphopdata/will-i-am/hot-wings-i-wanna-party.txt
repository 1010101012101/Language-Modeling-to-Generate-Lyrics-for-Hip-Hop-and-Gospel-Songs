Party in the Ipanema, baby! 
 I wanna party

 I wanna party 
 I wanna samba 
 I wanna party 
 And live my life (my life) 
 I wanna party (party) 
 And fly 
 Imma fly, fly just like a bird 
 (But you are a bird!) 
 Oh yeah, you're right, 
 So let me fly just like a rocket, then (okay) 
 Fly so high where I need to come down for oxygen (hey) 
 'Cause once we started, baby, ain't no ain't no stoppin' then (hey) 
 'Cause I just want to live my life and party (hey) 
 All I want is to be free, and rock my body (okay) 
 Been around the world and I wanna live my life 
 In Rio 
 'Cause in Rio 
 In Rio, I realize 
 I wanna party (party) 
 I wanna samba (party)

 And fly

 Master, master, master 
 Master, master 
 Who shall sound from my 
 Ghetto blaster, blaster, 
 Blaster, blaster, blaster 
 You dance fast, 
 But I dance faster, faster, faster 
 Faster, faster 
 You're too slow 
 You need to catch up 
 You can dance, and dance, but I? 
 I wanna party (party) 
 I wanna samba (party) 
 I wanna party (party) 
 I wanna samba (party) 
 I wanna party (party) 
 And live my life (live my life) 
 I wanna party (party) 
 And fly
