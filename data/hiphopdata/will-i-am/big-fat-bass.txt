 Big fat bass 
 The big fat bass 
 (Repeat: x4) 
 I can be the trouble baby 
 You can be the bass 
 You can be the bass 
 You can be the bass 
 Hey, you see me down on the floor 
 I want you to take me higher 
 Till I can't take it no more 
 It's gettin' bigger 
 The bass is gettin' bigger 
 And now, you see me up in the sky 
 I was rockin' the bottom 
 Now look at me I can fly 
 It's gettin' bigger 
 The bass is gettin' bigger 
 (Repeat: x2) 
 I can be your trouble baby 
 You can be my bass 
 You can be my bass 
 You can be my bass 
 (Repeat: x4) 
 It's gettin' bigger 
 The bass is gettin' bigger 
 The bass is getting low 
 The bass is getting low 
 The bass is getting low 
 It's gettin' bigger 
 The bass is gettin' bigger 
 Hey, you see me out in the night 
 Wanna go out dancing 
 So I can feel all right 
 It's gettin' bigger 
 The bass is gettin' bigger 
 Yo, take me out in the lights 
 I wanna have me a good time 
 The bass is feelin' nice 
 It's gettin' bigger 
 The bass is gettin' bigger 
 (Repeat: x4) 
 I can be your trouble baby 
 You can be my bass 
 You can be my bass 
 You can be my bass 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Y'all better get ready for the kick drum 
 For the kick drum 
 For the kick drum 
 Y'all better get ready for the kick drum 
 For the kick drum

 Yo it's the kick drum 
 Come and get some 
 Of the sound that's rockin' your system 
 When it pounds it cause an addiction 
 You addicts better have a prescription 
 Me and Brit got the whole club trippin' 
 They sit and wait and listen 
 For the kick drum 
 For the kick drum 
 For the kick drum 
 For the kick drum 
 For the big big fat fat bass 
 Rockin' all in your face 
 Vibrate shake up the place 
 Right now let's get crazy 
 Here we go, here we go, here we go 
 Everybody in the place get frantic 
 This beat right here's gigantic 
 Yo
