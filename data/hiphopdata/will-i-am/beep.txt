It's funny how a man only thinks about the 
 Got a real big heart, but I'm lookin' at your 
 Got real big brains, but I'm lookin' at your 
 Girl it ain't no pain in me lookin' at you 
 I don't give a keep lookin' at my 
 Cause it don't mean a thing when you're only lookin' at my

 Want to hold me with their hands, 
 Want to 
 I keep turning' 'em down, 
 But they always come around 
 Asking me to go around 
 That's not the way it's going down. 
 'Cause they only want, 
 Only want my 
 Only want, what they want 
 But 
 It's funny how a man only thinks about the 
 Got a real big heart, but I'm lookin' at your 
 Got real big brains, but I'm lookin' at your 
 Girl it ain't no pain in me lookin' at yo

 And two, your just too aggressive, try to get your 
 Do you know, that I know? 
 And I don't want to go there! 
 'Cause they only want, 
 Only want my 
 Only want, what they want 
 But 
 It's funny how a man only thinks about the 
 Got a real big heart, but I'm lookin' at your 
 Got real big brains, but I'm lookin' at your 
 Girl it ain't no pain in me lookin' at yo

 Cause it don't mean a thing when you're only lookin' at my 
 Ha, I'm gonna do my think while you're playing with yo 
 You got it bad, but oh well 
 You want it bad, bad, oh 
 What you got from me 
 Is something I, 
 Something I don't need! 
 It's funny how a man only thinks about the
