Watching the world 
 Watching them all go insane 
 Look at 'em all 
 Look at 'em do evil things 
 So I go out and dance 
 Party my problems away 
 Look at me now (look at me now) 
 Look at me dancing again 
 (Repeat: x4) 
 In a club nothing really matters 
 Drop the beat 
 In a club 
 I rock club life, come out at night 
 Shot till daylight, hot models my type 
 Let's go, take flight, explode dynamite 
 Disco black light 
 In a club 
 Party people rocking hardcore in a club 
 DJ rock the fucking dance floor in a club 
 Hot mamas dancing, oh lord, in a club 
 I just came to rock on out, to escape from the world 
 Watching the world (watching the world) 
 Watching them all go insane 
 Look at 'em all (look at 'em all) 
 Look at 'em do evil things 
 So I go out and dance 
 Party my problems away 
 Look at me now 
 Look at me dancing again 
 (Repeat: x4) 
 In a club nothing really matters 
 Drop the beat 
 In a club 
 Feeling like a star when I walk in the house 
 DJ spun that record and he burned down the house 
 Just like MC Hammer I'ma turn the motha out 
 I'ma rock the dance floor, check me out 
 I came here with my people, we gon' fuck up the place 
 I was stressed out, so I had to get away 
 The world is going mad, I think they gon' crazy 
 So I just gotta break on out 
 (Repeat: x4) 
 In a club nothing really matters 
 (Repeat: x5) 
 Drop the beat
