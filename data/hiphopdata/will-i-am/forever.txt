Baby let's party all night long (long, long, long, long), 
 Let's make it last forever. 
 Baby let's party all night long (long, long, long, long), 
 Let's make it last forever. 
 On that bogalo shrimp no zip, while I, I'm gonna live (live), 
 R Cash White Stripes. 
 I'm bustin' outta my cage (cage), 
 I won't go out and get with trash. 
 Rock'n'roll like Johnny Cash 
 My crash (whip) whiplash. 
 Pedal to the metal, 
 I'm pumping that gas. 
 Party like it's the last day, 
 Burn the town leave it all in place. 
 Tonight I'm going crazy, 
 And now I don't care about what you say. 
 I will go out and do my way, 
 Hey I will party pretty hard on the boulevard. 
 Baby let's party all night long (long, long, long, long), 
 Let's make it last forever. 
 Baby let's party all night long (long, long, long, long), 
 Let's make it last forever. 
 Let's go party down till the AM 
 Shout out to DJ AM 
 We're gonna miss you miss you playin'. 
 You're a super mega DJ and now, 
 I want a moment of silence for my friend. 
 Yeah, now let's rock it hard, 
 Wolfgang this beat bang. 
 Make a motherfucker wanna gangbang, 
 Get ignorant let my chain hang. 
 This is what the niggas call, 
 And now I'ma live it up. 
 And get it until I'm giving up, 
 I'm partying hard on the boulevard. 
 Make it last last last 
 Make it last last last 
 Make it last last last 
 Make it last last last 
 (Repeat: x2) 
 Baby let's party all night long 
 Let's make it last forever. 
 Baby let's party all night long 
 Let's make it last forever.
