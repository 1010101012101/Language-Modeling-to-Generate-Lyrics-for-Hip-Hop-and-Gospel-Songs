I've been around the world in the pouring rain, 
 Feeling out of place, really feeling strange, 
 Take me to a place where the know my name, 
 'Cause I ain't met nobody that looks the same, 
 I'm a fish out of water, Lion out of the jungle, 
 (He a fish out of water, lion out of the jungle) 
 I need my peoples, my peoples, take me to my peoples, 
 (He got jungle fever, show him some love, show him love) 
 Just gotta have someone, gotta have someone, to relate to, to relate to, 
 (I found my breath before) 
 Just gotta have someone, gotta have someone, to relate to, to relate to, 
 (I found my breath before) 
 See I been traveling, 
 Been travelin' forever, 
 But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven, 
 See I been traveling, 
 Been travelin' forever, 
 But now that I'm home feels like I'm in heaven, 
 See I been traveling, 
 Been travelin' forever, 
 But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven, 
 Feels like I'm in heaven, feels like I'm in heaven, 
 Feels like I'm in heaven, feels like I'm in heaven, heaven, 
 Travelin' the world like a torren man, 
 Been around the planet in a forign land, 
 I've seen things that I thought I'd never see, 
 Take me to a place where they look like me, 
 I'm a lion out the jungle, fish out of the ocean, 
 (He's a lion out the jungle, fish out of the ocean) 
 I need my peoples, my peoples, take me to my peoples, 
 (He got jungle fever, show him some love, show him love) 
 Just gotta have someone, gotta have someone, to relate to, to relate to, 
 (I found my breath before) 
 Just gotta have someone, gotta have someone, to relate to, to relate to, 
 (I found my breath before) 
 See I been traveling, 
 Been travelin' forever, 
 But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven, 
 See I been traveling, 
 Been travelin' forever, 
 But now that I'm home feels like I'm in heaven, 
 See I been travelin', 
 Been travelin' forever, 
 But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven, 
 Feels like I'm in heaven, feels like I'm in heaven, 
 Feels like I'm in heaven, feels like I'm in heaven, heaven, 
 Feels like I'm in heaven, feels like I'm in heaven, 
 Ooh, whoa ooh whoa,
