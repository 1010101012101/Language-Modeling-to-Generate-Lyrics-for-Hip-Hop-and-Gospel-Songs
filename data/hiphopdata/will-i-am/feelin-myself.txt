I be everywhere, everybody know me 
 Super, super fresh, what a dope styling 
 Hunny on my wrist, couple karats on my neck 
 Givenchy, keep the chickens in check 
 All these car keys drive them chickens to my crib 
 Jewel heel, got somebody slipping in my bed 
 She give me IQ, that mean she get a head 
 I just give the beats, I don't give a bread 
 'Cause we be in the club 
 Bottles on deck 
 And God dammit, God dammit 
 I'm feeling myself 
 'Cause I'm a get it all 
 And I'm a throw it up 
 Like God dammit, God dammit 
 I'm feeling myself 
 Look up in the mirror 
 The mirror look at me

 Pool in the crib you could land a water plane in it 
 Slick Rick looking at the mirror (mirror) 
 Big Daddy Kane bitch like Shakira (Shakira) 
 1.5 custom made car (car)

 I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem) 
 And I don't give a fuck that's my fuckin' problem (huh)

 Been rocking coats since my first demo (yeah) 
 And now I'm banging hoes in the continental (yup) 
 And I done seen me slidin' out my dope ride (yup) 
 I open up the doors, suicide (yup) 
 I came from the bottom, the sewer side (yup) 
 I made it to the top 'cause I do it fly (yup) 
 Feelin' fuckin' lucky like the fuckin' Irish

 I tour the whole world like a dirty pirate (argh) 
 To give the whole club some Miley Cyrus 
 Now everybody trippin' like they poppin' molly 
 Up in the club, is where you find me 
 I do it real big never do it tiny 
 If you about that bullshit please don't remind me 
 I step in this motherfucker just to make it work 
 I get on the floor just to make that booty twerk 
 Shake, shake that shit like a, like an expert 
 Shake, shake that shit like a, like an expert 
 I'll be everywhere, everybody know me 
 Super, super fresh, what a dope styling

 You the shit, you the shit 
 Doobie in my hand, rollie on my wrist 
 Got a bottle of that thousand dollar champagne in my fist 
 Women in your dreams sleep in my bed 
 So I don't need your brains I need my ass kissed 
 But all my homies like give me some head 
 Smoke joints till our eyes turn Indian red 
 Take shots till our chests burn 
 We got papers, bottles, mollies, all this let's get it started 
 The bigger the bill, the bigger you ball 
 The bigger the watch, the bigger the car, the bigger the star 
 The bigger the chain, the farther you go, you already know 
 The bigger the bank that's more hoes, nigga 
 And I done spent a quarter milli on clothes 
 Coppin' them oldschools and puttin' foreigns on the road 
 Real talk and if my fuel get low 
 I roll up another joint, take a shot and reload, pow 
 I'll be everywhere, everybody know me 
 Super, super fresh, what a dope styling 
 Hunny on my wrist, couple karats on my neck 
 Givenchy, keep the chickens in check 
 All these car keys drive them chickens to my crib 
 Jewel heel, got somebody slipping in my bed 
 She give me IQ, that mean she get a head 
 I just give the beats, I don't give a bread 
 'Cause we be in the club 
 Bottles on deck 
 And God dammit, God dammit 
 I'm feeling myself 
 'Cause I'm a get it all 
 And I'm a throw it up 
 Like God dammit, God dammit 
 I'm feeling myself 
 Look up in the mirror 
 And the mirror look at me 
 The mirror be like baby you the shit 
 God dammit you the shit 
 You the shit, you the shit (God damn) 
 God dammit you the shit 
 God dammit you the shit 
 You the shit, you the shit
