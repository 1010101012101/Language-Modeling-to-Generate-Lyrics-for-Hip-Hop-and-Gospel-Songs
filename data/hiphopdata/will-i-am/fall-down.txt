 Miley 
 You get me off, you get me off the ground 
 Will.i.am and Miley 
 You pick me up when I fall down 
 You pick me up when I fall down 
 Will.i.am 
 Girl, you're like an elevator cause you always pick me up 
 Girl, you're like a doctor when I'm sick you always stitch me up 
 You can be my DJ, I'm your record, come on mix me up 
 You can be my lollipop, lemme, lemme lick you up 
 On the bottom, on the top, baby, lemme flip you up 
 You can be my soda pop, Coca-Cola sip it up 
 Whip cream, whip it up, strip on, zip it up 
 I could be your chip, you can be my dip, lemme dip it up 
 You make my world, you make my world go 'round
