And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive 
 And on, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly 
 And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive 
 And I'm loving every second minute hour bigger better stronger power 
 I got that power 
 I got that power 
 I got that power 
 Power power power 
 They call me will-A 
 Stay so cool, I'm chilly 
 I done made that maley 
 On my way to that valet 
 Used to have a piggy bank, but now I got that bigger bank 
 Who who cares what the haters state 
 They hate on me 'cause we doing what they can't 
 I stay on that hustle, I flex that loose to muscle 
 Hate to bust your bubble 
 I'm on that other level 
 I'mma take it higher and high and high and higher 
 I stay and buy attire 
 Keeping burning like that fire 
 And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive 
 And on, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly 
 And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive 
 And I'm loving every second minute hour bigger better stronger power 
 I got that power 
 I got that power 
 I got that power 
 Power power power 
 Yes yes yes y'all feeling funky fresh y'all 
 Work to be the best y'all 
 We're good under pressure y'all 
 Been through all that stress y'all 
 Get this off my chest y'all 
 Made it out in project where this project that's progress y'all 
 I beat it through my mama 
 I told her what I was on it 
 That I'mma be that number 
 One day I'll be that number 1 
 I take it higher and high and high and higher 
 I stay and buy attire 
 Keeping burning like that fire 
 Whatever doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger 
 So I'mma get stronger 
 Call me like a veteran, veteran 
 I lock lock it down and go again 
 Call me like a veteran, veteran 
 I lock lock it down and go again 
 And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive 
 And on, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly 
 And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive 
 And I'm loving every second minute hour bigger better stronger power 
 I got that power 
 I got that power 
 I got that power 
 Power power power 
 And I'm loving every second minute hour bigger better stronger power 
 And I'm loving every second minute hour bigger better stronger power
