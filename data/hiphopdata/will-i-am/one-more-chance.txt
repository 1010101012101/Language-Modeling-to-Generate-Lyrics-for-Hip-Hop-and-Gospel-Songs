Take me back 
 Take me back

 Girls girls girls 
 Girls girls girls 
 Girls girls girls 
 Take me back 
 One more chance 
 This time around I'll get it fine I know 
 One more chance 
 Let me undo what I done before 
 One more 
 Girl I be loving you like la la la 
 But it be hitting you like blah blah blah 
 We be going back and forth like volleyball 
 Battling each other like galactica 
 Girl our love could be spectacular 
 But we crash like vehicular 
 Homicide I know why you sick of a brother 
 With tricks that's quick to trick on ya 
 I know you want more than a dick in ya 
 You want a good nigga to stick with ya 
 I'll stick with ya and perfect my love 
 I'll protect ya girl if you give me just 
 One more chance 
 This time around I'll get it fine I know 
 One more chance 
 Let me undo what I've done before 
 'Cause I don't wanna go 
 Another day, another lonely night 
 I don't wanna be 
 In this world without you in my life 
 One more chance 
 This time around 
 Baby protect the love 
 La la la la this time around 
 Baby protect the love 
 La la la la 
 Baby protect the love 
 La la la la this time around 
 Better get it right 
 This time around 
 Better get it right 
 Lemme lemme lemme lemme love you all day 
 Remix our love in a new way 
 Put it on put it on replay replay 
 Spin it around and around like a DJ (DJ) 
 Forever and ever and always 
 Our endeavor got me sure like albey 
 Yesterday gotcha feeling a little salty 
 Girl I promise you imma love you love you all the way 
 To the end L-O-V-I-N 
 Girl I'm serious no more pretending 
 I received all the love your sending 
 I'll give my all if you give me just 
 One more chance 
 This time around it's time for a different flow 
 A new romance 
 Do the things we've never done before 
 'Cause I don't wanna do 
 The same mistakes that I made yesterday 
 I love you 
 I really love you baby 
 I really love you baby 
 Laaa 
 Baby protect the love 
 Lalala this time around 
 Baby protect the love

 This time around, this time around, this time around, this time around 
 I promise baby imma change it 
 I'll remix it no more same shit 
 This time around, this time around, this time around, this time around 
 I promise baby I'll rearrange it I'll remix it no more same shit 
 This time around, this time around, this time around 
 Check it out now, check it out now, check it out now 
 Eh eh 
 Fuck your friends girl 
 They just haters they just think that I'm a player 
 But you don't see that love is greater 
 If not now then maybe later 
 Cause endlessly enormously 
 You will see my love will be strong until the end 
 Baby give me one more chance 
 This time around I'll get it fine I know 
 One more chance 
 Let me undo what I've done before 
 'Cause I don't want to go 
 Another day, another lonely night 
 I don't wanna be 
 In this world without you in my life 
 One more chance 
 La la la la la la
