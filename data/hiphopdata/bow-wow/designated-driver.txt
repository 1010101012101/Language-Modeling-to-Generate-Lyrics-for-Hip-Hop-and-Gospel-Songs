Bow Wow:Whoo! I'm sayin'

 And um I could sense dat lil mama been drinkin' 2 much 
 Dis wat I tell her 
 (Voice): I told her hop in 
 Friends don't let friends drive drunk 
 Hop in friends don't let friends drive drunk 
 Hop in! Hop-Hop in! 
 Omarion:She was posted by the bar 
 So I decided I should walk over 
 Yeah 
 She said can you help me 2 my car 
 And sit with me until I get sober 
 I told her baby you can (just wrap your arms around me 
 I'll be there 2 walk u 2 your door 
 You're safe from harm around me 
 ) U don't have 2 worry anymore 
 Girl I'm your designated driver 
 Buckle up girl 'cause I'm takin' you home tonight 
 And I'm layin you up in my bed 
 I know grown 
 But you had 2 many shots of patron tonight 
 'Cause you're losing your head 
 I told her hop in 
 Friends don't let friends drive drunk 
 Hop in friends don't let friends drive drunk 
 Girl I'm your designated driver 
 Buckle up girl 'cause I'm takin' you home tonight 
 Omarion:I got a t-shirt waitin 4 u 
 But after you hop outta the shower 
 Then I'mma rub your body down wit oil 
 Message you head 2 feet 4 an hour 
 Then I'm breakin you off so (just wrap your arms around me 
 I'll be there 2 walk u 2 your door 
 You're safe from harm around me) 
 U don't have 2 worry anymore! 
 Girl I'm your designated driver 
 Buckle up girl 'cause I'm takin' you home tonight 
 (Girl I wanna take you home) And I'm layin you up in my bed 
 I know you grown

 'Cause you're losing your head 
 I told her hop in 
 Friends don't let friends drive drunk 
 Hop in friends don't let friends drive drunk 
 Girl I'm your designated driver 
 Buckle up girl 'cause I'm takin' you home tonight

 (Chorus) Girl I'm your designated driver 
 Buckle up girl 'cause I'm takin' you home tonight 
 'Cause I'm layin you up in my bed

 Becuz you're losin your head
