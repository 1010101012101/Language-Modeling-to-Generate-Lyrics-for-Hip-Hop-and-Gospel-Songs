If you ever bought a tape 
 Purchased a C.D or a piece of vinyl 
 DJ'd my record 
 Promoted my record 
 I wanna thank y'all man from the bottom of my heart 
 Secondly, I wanna dedicate this song to y'all man 
 Cause without ya there is no me 
 I could never turn my back on y'all cause y'all put me where I'm at 
 So when you call I'll be there just like that 
 Signing autographs, givin' daps to all my folks 
 Telling little kids don't follow these dopes 
 See I'ma keep barking as long as y'all bark with me 
 You Know the website all you gotta do is hit me, man 
 As much as the girls like me 
 You'd think it make fellas sick 
 But they be right with'em 
 Singing not missin' a lick 
 Hair braided rocking somebodies jersey 
 From up top to out west 
 And down in the dirty 
 Can't forget about the midwest 
 Cause that's where I was found 
 That's where I live and Columbus is the town 
 I got the pen 
 You got the paper 
 A c.d. a tape 
 I sign it then leave and get a nice big plate of fish which is my favorite 
 Dish But without y'all I couldn't kick it like this 
 I wanna thank you 
 For making me who I am and putting me where I need to be 
 I wanna thank you 
 For the opputunity to do my thang in this industry 
 I wanna thank you 
 For callin to your local stations day after day to play my song 
 If it wasn't for you there wouldn't be no me and that's why 
 I wanna ride for you 
 Forever More ... I just wanna thank you 
 I wanna thank you for the groups that came before me 
 All of y'all in the office that promote me on the streets 
 All the mom and pop store that don't get alot of credit 
 The spots in the hood the first ones that said it 
 All the mix show d'js please keep it pumpin 
 Thank you for your support and yes I'm gonna keep it comin' 
 I love how you love that 
 So I'm givin' back 
 Cause ya the ones that kept this playa on track 
 The reason I'm seen 
 Is because of you 
 The reason I'm heard and my dreams came true 
 Now if you ever made a poster or wrote a fan letter 
 All I'm try'n do is show you some L-O-V-E 
 And that you know without ya there is no me 
 JD, JE, the whole SSD 
 Know if you ride for we Then I'ma ride for you 
 From the bottom of my heart baby tell 'em what I wanna do
