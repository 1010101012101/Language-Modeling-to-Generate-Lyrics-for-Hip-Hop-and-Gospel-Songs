Bow wizzy 
 It's Mr. do it for the ladies what it do-x2 
 Call your man tell him you ain't goin' home tonight 
 That bath and body works got your body smellin right 
 Panties so edible I eat through em 
 Fishnet top 
 I can see through it 
 Baby let's do it 
 Why we wasting time 
 I make her get moist when I lick her waistline 
 You want a baller well I can go baseline 
 She 5+5 
 Yep a strait dime 
 She was kinda nervous thought I was like other rappers 
 The type that'll fuck her then don't call after 
 Uh uh 
 That ain't my character 
 I can go all night so I hope you got stamina 
 Like kobe with rock 
 Lil mama I'd handle ya 
 Make ya debut press record on the camera 
 So everybody can watch what we doin' 
 Tool box love 
 And guess whose screwin? 
 This is cash money so you know I got pecos 
 G5 jet I got my pilot on pay-roll 
 Beast in the sheets grizzly like mayo 
 Hands over her mouth and don't speak until I say so 
 And like my black card I don't get denied 
 I whip my dick out and then I handle mine 
 But let's get x-rated 
 Talk dirty to me 
 She treat my dick like a mic and she sung to me 
 Huh 
 And I be rippin up her vocal chords 
 Beat it out the frame 
 Scream my name until your throat is sore 
 Man for the night, night, night, night, night, night 
 I can be man for the night-x2 
 So won't you holla at playa holla holla at plya hollat at 
 Playa holla holla girl-x2 
 Um um 
 I'ma beat the pussy up beat the pussy up-x4 
 Uh uh-x6 
 I bet ya I can make you leave your boyfriend 
 With no problem 
 Choop choop bitches-x4
