When I don't call you back I know it pisses you off 
 I'm getting to the money baby you know I'm a boss 
 When I'm not home I know she fiends for me 
 And when she all alone I know she'd be having dreams of me 
 Ok I'm a man and she my boo 
 We can make it through whatever look what we've been through 
 And I need you to be by my side 
 Down ass chick and she down to ride 
 Ok I'm grinding for me and her 
 Putting in work making sure she got plenty bread to fill up that purse 
 And I keep that thing wetter than a scuba diver 
 And she ain't never leaving me cause ain't a nigga flyer 
 I'm getting naked pictures straight to my e-mail from her feed mail 
 Talking she wanna ride me like a v twelve 
 Yeah and I be gone till November 
 But I will leave you something to remember 
 When I don't call you back I know it pisses you off 
 I'm getting to the money baby you know I'm a boss 
 When I'm not home I know she fiends for me 
 And when she all alone I know she'd be having dreams of me 
 Ok I'm a man and she my boo 
 We can make it through whatever look what we've been through 
 And I need you to be by my side 
 Down ass chick and she down to ride 
 Yeah I understand what she go through 
 Got her feelings caught up you know how girls do 
 So you're saying you unhappy ok well rest your case 
 Mad 'cause I was grinding trying to bring home the cake 
 So quit all these excuses and bad attitudes 
 I can't lie I ain't seen no woman as bad as you 
 Yeah and I be gone till November 
 But I will leave you something to remember 
 When I don't call you back I know it pisses you off 
 I'm getting to the money baby you know I'm a boss 
 When I'm not home I know she fiends for me 
 And when she all alone I know she'd be having dreams of me 
 Ok I'm a man and she my boo 
 We can make it through whatever look what we've been through 
 And I need you to be by my side 
 Down ass chick and she down to ride 
 When I don't call you back I know it pisses you off 
 I'm getting to the money baby you know I'm a boss
