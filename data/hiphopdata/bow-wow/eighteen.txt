Let's take a pause for a minute 
 Let's go 
 Check it out man 
 See man, Bow Weezy right here live and direct 
 I'm talkin' to y'all young'ns out there baby 
 I can't wait until I turn eighteen 
 I know it's the same for y'all 
 Man, I know, I know 
 I'm talkin' bout pullin up in them big cars on them 22's 
 Naw forget that, I'm talkin' bout Charlie Woodsens man 
 I'ma pull up, I'm talkin' bout 24's 
 It's a wrap for y'all when I turn eighteen 
 Listen to the hook 
 When I turn eighteen 
 I need to ride on some rims that's clean 
 And them brand new J's when I hit the scene 
 When I turn eighteen 
 I need a girlfriend older than me 
 And she gon have to be a dime if she rollin' wit me 
 When I turn eighteen 
 I pull up and stop, let my system knock 
 They all know I'm supercool when I drop the top 
 When I turn eighteen 
 I get my crib up on my first day 
 And every week we celebrate like it's my birthday 
 When I turn eighteen 
 Yeah 
 I'ma be leanin and dippin sittin' on some inches ridin' 
 Get in that, women they lovin' my every sentence 
 It's Weezy baby 
 From the truck to the drops to the coup to the high 2's 
 See that y'all, you gotta believe me baby 
 The game tight and the bank right 
 Since fame came in the bright light 
 You gotta release me baby 
 I can't be tied up 
 Can't be handcuffed to no chick at the party when I ride up 
 'Cause I gotta mingle 
 I know I'm great with the lingo but ya hear 
 I gotta motivate, I just gotta be single 
 And yeah like when I see you 
 Yeah like how you jingle 
 And yeah said I'ma ring you but baby I can't bring you 
 Can't wait till the day comes 
 When I wake up and I'm eighteen 
 Not a young pup but a big dawg 
 And I bark loud and I switch cars 
 It sounds hard but it's not y'all 
 When I get there that's it y'all 
 Ninth day of the third month, it's on 
 Up in that H2 with them wheels to match 
 Got them big dawg speakers bumpin up in the back 
 Got that Snoop Dogg CD is what I insert 
 Roll down my windows, sounds like a concert 
 And on a beautiful day 
 I just might switch in the Rover 
 So fresh so clean like Outkast 
 APD can't pull me over 
 I'm big pimpin' like Jay-Z 
 Steady stunning like Baby 
 I need a girl like Free mixed with some Hale Barry 
 And a lil hood which is good like Trina to be my lady 
 Just call me Cassius Clay 
 Baby 'cause I'm the greatest 
 And can't nobody my age can never ever fade this 
 I'm unfadeable 
 I'm untouchable 
 I'm on a mission now 
 I'm in transition now 
 B-O double double O double 
 It's Bow Wow 
 I'm in the house now and I'm up outta the pound 
 Now listen to the hook, this how it's goin' down 
 Yeah, you know what I'm sayin' 
 I'm speakin' for all the young ones my age 
 Ya namean 
 Bein told you can't do this 
 You can't get in here 
 And you wanna do it 
 This the song right here 
 This the anthem for us right here 'cause I'm one of them 
 Always told no, you can't get in 
 But you know what 
 That's gonna change man 
 When I
