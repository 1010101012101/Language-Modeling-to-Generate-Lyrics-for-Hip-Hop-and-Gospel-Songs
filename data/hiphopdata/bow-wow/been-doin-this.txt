Say man, old niggas told me 
 There two types of nigga in life you know 
 Niggas who talk that shit 
 And niggas who do that shit 
 Let them niggas gon' hate 'cause they got to 
 What I care about you 
 Hey, you know I been doing this for years 
 Other niggas saying wait, I ain't got to 
 Other niggas cop two 
 And you know I been doing this for years 
 Why theses niggas gon' hate? 
 'Cause they got to, never let 'em stop you 
 Hey, you know I been doing this for years 
 Other niggas sayin' "Wait, I ain't got to" 
 You know I been not to 
 You know I been doing this for years 
 Hit the club, do it big 
 Show these niggas how I live 
 100 G's for the chain 
 Couple mill for the crib 
 If you had it like I had 
 I bet you do it like this 
 Lamborghini dubs going up 
 Looking so sick 
 I make it rain, I make it rain 
 In any club that I go into 
 Toss a couple stacks out 
 Ballin' yeah, that's what I do 
 And these niggas know 
 Exactly what I'm riding on 
 (What you ride homie?) 
 24 inches on the old school 
 Beat up knockin' 
 These hoes keep jockin' 
 And these tags I'm a pop 'em 
 I'm a real show shopper 
 Sold out shows everywhere I go 
 Just to hear the young boy 
 From the old ways flow 
 When it comes to the money 
 I'mam get that doe 
 I'ma get that doe nigga that's for sho' 
 Can't nobody do it quite like this man 
 They cool but they ain't like this man 
 Got ice on my neck and my wrist man 
 Y'all niggas can't do it like this man 
 And I'm still on top whether you like it or not 
 Nigga, I won't flop, what you think 
 'Cause I sold a couple of million I'm gon' stop? 
 Let them niggas gon' hate 'cause they got to 
 What I care about you 
 Hey, you know I been doing this for years 
 Other niggas saying wait, I ain't got to 
 Other niggas cop two 
 And you know I been doing this for years 
 Why theses niggas gon' hate? 
 'Cause they got to, never let 'em stop you 
 Hey, you know I been doing this for years 
 Other niggas sayin' wait, I ain't got to 
 You know I been not to 
 You know I been doing this for years 
 These nigga can't do it like I 
 Everyday this nigga stay fly 
 26 inches be on my ride 
 Hear my dubs be suicide 
 Still black card spending 
 If it's hot then I'm in it 
 When it comes to the hoes 
 You know I'm a get 'em 
 At the mall everyday 
 So you know that I'm fitted 
 Everything that I done hop in undid it 
 Tell these men first time I drop 
 6 years later still on top 
 Makin' these hits but it ain't gon stop 
 I'm a get this money till my casket drop 
 And yes, yes, my nigga I'm a baller 
 They had to nickname me Mr. tear the mall up 
 Clip the bar when I hit that mall 
 Shut the whole mall down 
 Buying everything I saw 
 And these lame niggas hating on me 
 'Cause they hoes all want me 
 Hey, it ain't my fault 
 You should havin' it, check homie 
 Something like a pimp 
 Yeah, I ball from a sip 
 So much money in my pocket 
 Got me walkin' with a limp 
 And you say you got money 
 But I ain't like this 
 And I'm a keep shinin' on you 
 Haters so sick, haha
