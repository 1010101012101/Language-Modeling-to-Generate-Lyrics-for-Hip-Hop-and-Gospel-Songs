From the C-O to across the seas 
 I'm guaranteed to everybody bounce with me 
 Been known to put it down anyplace I be 
 You can copy, but it's only gon' be one me 
 I don't ride in no cars 'til a man come wit' me 
 Fourteen and I started up a whole epidemic 
 Look, y'all know what I'm talkin' about 
 Ever since I hooked up with the homie down south 
 TV shows, magazine covers 
 Girls in groups sayin', "We go with each other" 
 Sold out shows, pocket full of cake 
 What you know about selling tres mil out the gate? 
 I'm the hottest thang around 
 Neck full of bling bling like the Neptune sound 
 I got it locked on the left, right, front and rear 
 When I step up in the spot, this is all I hear 
 I said Lil' Bow Wow, you just don't know 
 The way you move so fast across the floor 
 I mean you run through my mind like all the time 
 To the point that I just wanna take ya home 
 Right now, when I'm old, where I'm gonna be 
 How I flow, homie, you can bet the house on me 
 I'ma forever be up under the scope 
 I ain't tryin' to go out like Todd Bridges off Different Strokes 
 I was born to rock, born to rhyme 
 What you lookin' at is somethin' that's before their time 
 Like the number 2-3 in the red and black 
 Mr. 106 and Park is back, holla 
 I do it like no other 
 And attract mo' family than Ringling Brothers 
 I got 'em scattered, covered, smothered like hash browns 
 See, I'm the best, just ask around 
 I'm here now, and ain't nobody takin' mine 
 It's a waste of time if you thinkin' you can 
 You betta off gettin' a shirt, makin' a sign that reads 
 "Shad Moss, I'm yo number 1 fan" 
 I said Lil' Bow Wow, you just don't know 
 The way you move so fast across the floor 
 I mean you run through my mind like all the time 
 To the point that I just wanna take ya home
