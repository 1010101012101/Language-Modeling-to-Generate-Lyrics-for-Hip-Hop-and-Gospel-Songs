Uh uh uh 
 Yeah I say lil soldiers need love too 
 Who need love... lil soldiers need love too 
 When I was young I saw a gurl I wanted her to be mine 
 We would laugh, hug, and talk alll the time 
 My mom said I'm too young... but I don't think so 
 I can take her every where I go 
 All I'm sayin' is lil soldiers need love too!
