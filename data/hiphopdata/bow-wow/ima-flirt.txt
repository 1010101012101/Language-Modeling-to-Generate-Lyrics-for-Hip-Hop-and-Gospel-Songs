Kels, Bow Weezy 
 Jackin' for chicks 
 I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma flirt 
 Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'ma flirt 
 Winkin' eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'ma flirt 
 Sometimes when I'm wit my chick on the low, I'ma flirt 
 And when she's wit her man lookin' at me, damn right I'ma flirt 
 So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause I'ma flirt 
 And baby, don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause I'ma flirt 
 Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her 
 Then don't bring her 'round me because I'ma flirt 
 I'ma be pimpim', I don't be slippin' when it come down to these *** 
 I don't love 'em, we don't cuff 'em, man and it's just the way it goes 
 I pull up in the Phantom, all the ladies think I'm handsome 
 Jewelry shinin', I stay stuntin', that's why these *** can't stand 'em 
 I'ma chick magnet and anything fine, I'm baggin' it 
 And if she got a man, I don't care 
 10 toes and I wanna be 'cause I gotta have it 
 Now, now, who do it like B O dub? Girls on me when I walk in the club 
 Game ain't tight, I'ma take your chick, that's hitman 
 Now your girl in love 
 When I ***, fly young dude, ride wit me, lil' mama, can't lose 
 Don't get mad at me, homie because your girlfriend choose 
 See this is how it's goin' down in the 614 
 From the Nata up to Cleveland, even into Leo 
 I'ma boss and you know it, I got the money, I'ma show it 
 If I give your girl one chance to talk to me 
 Homie, she ain't gon' blow it 
 Now the moral of the story is cuff your chick 'cause hey 
 I'm black, fresh and I rap, plus I'm rich and I'ma flirt 
 Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'ma flirt 
 Winkin' eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'ma flirt 
 Sometimes when I'm wit my chick on the low, I'ma flirt 
 And when she's wit her man lookin' at me, damn right I'ma flirt 
 So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause I'ma flirt 
 And baby, don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause I'ma flirt 
 Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her 
 Then don't bring her 'round me because I'ma flirt 
 I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma flirt 
 That's right, I tell the truth and the whole truth 
 When it come to *** I be pimpin' like I supposed to 
 Rollin' like I supposed to, shinin' like I supposed to 
 In the club *** wit honeys like I supposed to 
 I don't understand when a *** bring his girlfriend to the club 
 Creepin' all on the floor wit his girlfriend in the club 
 And wonder why all these players tryna holla at her 
 Just soon as she go to the bathroom, I'ma holla at her 
 A dog on a cloud when I'm walkin' through the mall 
 If I could, man, I'd probably flirt wit all of y'all 
 Yeah, yeah, homie, you say she your girlfriend 
 But when I step up to her, I'ma be like Tarzan 
 Believe me, man, this is how them playas do it in the Chi 
 And plus we got them playerette foolers in the Chi 
 Now the moral of story is cuff your *** 'cause hey 
 I'm black, handsome, I sing 'cause I'm rich and I'ma flirt 
 Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'ma flirt
