See around here, I make things that make y'all bounce 
 Ya know? Ya know what I mean? 
 Left to right, right to left, it's So So Def 
 An' it's goin' down, ya know what I mean? 
 My man, Bow Wow, yeah, ya heard? 
 Let's go, let's go, let's go 
 Around here we pop them collars 
 Around here we get them dollars 
 Every girl I see that look right 
 A nigga like me just gotta holla 
 This kid here all about stackin' up 
 Got big head but we can back it up 
 Long 'cause everybody get crunk 
 When we drop in, the club starts actin' up 
 I represent the S O S O 
 D e f m o b 
 That's me, JD, Da Brat an' JE 
 So please believe 
 What I do ain't never been done 
 Ohio is where I'm from 
 I heard what you said an' I saw what you do 
 An' y'all playas really don't want none 
 From the day to the night, I rock 
 Say what you like, never not 
 Stayin' alive, livin' the life 
 Gots to keep it hot 
 Shotgun in the drop, ridin' good 
 Twenties, TVs, leather an' wood 
 Poppin', watchin' Big Momma holdin' it down 
 Like a playa should, sing along now 
 All I wanna do is see ya 
 Bounce with me, bounce with me 
 Grab a partner, hit the floor 
 Bounce with me, bounce with me 
 Some clap, clap others stomp 
 But around here we get it crunk when ya 
 Bounce with me, bounce with me 
 All I wanna do is see ya 
 Bounce with me, bounce with me 
 Grab a partner, hit the floor 
 Bounce with me, bounce with me 
 Some clap, clap others stomp 
 But around here we get it crunk when ya 
 Bounce with me, bounce with me 
 It's the B to the O W Wow 
 Even your girl fall in love when I smile 
 The tight little guy you ain't seen in a while 
 Ignore the hype, just right for you size 
 I get in where I fit in, braided up 
 Made the bucks an' I'm still a kid 
 Imagine what life like when I get big 
 I'ma be rich, surrounded by chicks 
 Couple of cars, couple of cribs 
 Gettin' a couple of mills 
 Shinin' every time I feel 
 You see how So So get ill 
 You don't want no stuff up in here 
 Bow to the Wow, get it in your ear now 
 I get down 'cause I'm hit bound 
 An' I rock an iced out 
 Mickey Mouse around my neck 
 An' I hang on niggas like Vince Carter 
 With his arm in the net 
 An' I outta snatch up your daughters 
 But I was brought up with respect 
 When I turn 16, I'ma call her though 
 An' show her how to ride with a baller, yo 
 Let her know why it wouldn't hurt her 
 To fall in love with a nigga like me a long time ago 
 Sing along now 
 All I wanna do is see ya 
 Bounce with me, bounce with me 
 Grab a partner, hit the floor 
 Bounce with me, bounce with me 
 Some clap, clap others stomp 
 But around here we get it crunk when ya 
 Bounce with me, bounce with me 
 All I wanna do is see ya 
 Bounce with me, bounce with me 
 Grab a partner, hit the floor 
 Bounce with me, bounce with me 
 Some clap, clap others stomp 
 But around here we get it crunk when ya 
 Bounce with me, bounce with me 
 I, I, I wanna see you bounce with me now 
 Take, take, take it down to the ground with me now 
 Shake, shake, shake it all around the town with me now 
 What'cha gon' do shorty, what'cha gon' do?
