 So whateva I'm pass the mike down 
 To the B-o-ww-ow you in trouble

 Ain't nottin like a lil cat wit his mind write 
 In tha lime light chasin a dream 
 At tha same time makin' some cream 
 Nickname scary 'cause I know how to make 'em scream 
 Everytime I'm seen I'm fool of flash 
 Everytime I'm out pockets full of cash 
 Ain't about my team ain't no need to ask 
 We steady steady keep puttin' down the smash

 Before I became a teen 
 I known that microphone put up cones of ice cream 
 And that's why I don't care who you are 
 When it comes to me you gotta raise the bar

 Witha nick nack paddy wack throw me a bone 
 And this play boy goin' bring it ya heard me? 
 This playboy he getts crunk bring that bang up in the trunk

 Brook cards like a breef hang blangs like a reef 
 I wish one of you bussters would spark some beef 
 I swear to god its goin' be hard for your moms to sleep

 Haters still sho me love 
 Wit dap tees and hugs that's the life of a thug

 Straight to you ballers icey boy and hunky

 While bowwow in the front shootin hoop with my son 
 Big duke representin for the whole east side

 This playboy he getts crunk bring that bang up in the trunk 
 Witha nick nack paddy wack throw me a bone

 In a block full screamin up in trl 
 And another I want y'all niggaz to know

 I got somethin' to show and something to say 
 And I can down anything in my way

 If you so free I'm trying to be fly 
 And be tha first kid on the cover of vibe 
 So if you at #1 u betta save it back 'cause once I get it it ain't never comin' back forsure
