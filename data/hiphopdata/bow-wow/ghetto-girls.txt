 Verse 1 (JD)

 A shorty that can tell ya when the J's come out (okay) 
 Get creative with the hair cuts like T-Boz

 And to get where she going she can take the bus (uh) 
 Like when Jada was Peaches in the movie Shame (uh huh) 
 Hard to find her time to be sittin' at the Rucker's game (okay) 
 They only like dealin'wit cats that love to floss 
 Only like rockin' the stuff that really costs 
 Lip gloss shinin'(uh), tattoos on the back 
 Attitude like Mary J. mixed wit Brat (I like that) 
 You can find 'em at a beauty shop, mall, or church 
 Name brand hat, shoes, with the matching purse 
 So all that sedity stuff, y'all can keep 
 'Cause only girls that keep it ghetto that can ride wit me fo' sho

 They like hot boyz that push hot toys 
 And ball wit the best of them

 Switch the color on the hair like EV-E (okay)

 But walk like a lady (uh) 
 Snap like I snap and get a little crazy

 Bandanas to Barrettes 
 Daisy dukes to spandex 
 All that's good wit me

 Now believe me she got to go (uh, huh) 
 At the corner store buying up all the sweets 
 From choo-choos to rice krispies treats on my street 
 That's all I see like everyday (uh, huh) 
 And they do what they do in a crazy way (and what else) 
 Hang with the ballers so they never pay (and) 
 And they usually got a name that's hard to say, ya heard
