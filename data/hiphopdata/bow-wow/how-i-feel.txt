Let me get this off my chest l-l-let's be honest I'm a be real girl 
 And even though I think about you 
 To be honest you ain't got nothing on my new girl 
 To busy worrying bout my exes not enough... worry bout your damn self 
 This is how I feel let's see how far you gonna get without chantelle 
 Chea sometimes I felt like giving up 
 That's when my loving kicked in started to strengthen up 
 Thought we were made for each other 
 And the things I did with you id never share with another 
 Hey was this too much to ask for 
 Itd be nice if you spent time with your man more 
 Was it your jealous ways that caused us to go our separate ways 
 I know I did some wrongs too I admit to my mistakes 
 And I was comfortable with you we never used a rubber 
 We'd put it deep in your gut and fill you up like supper 
 Through a and uptown told you id be here with ya 
 Gonna hurt to see another dude instead of me with ya 
 And I'm telling you the truth girl you still cross my mind even though I got a new girl 
 Hey you always telling me to be real so don't be mad I'm just saying how I feel 
 Bow wizzle hey uh 
 Now let me get this off my chest l-l-let's be honest I'm a be real girl 
 And even though I think about you

 To busy worrying bout my exes not enough... worry bout your damn self 
 This is how I feel let's see how far you gonna get without chantelle 
 Hey you all around the world you saw things you would never see 
 Heard me talking to o girl that's why you mad at me 
 You slept with a ton of dudes you know I know them too 
 But you could'ntkeep it real and tell me the fucking truth 
 But I saw it coming I knew it wouldn't last long 
 I wrote this all about ya girl this your theme song 
 I fell in love too fast thinking you was special 
 So you can keep dry girl I ain't gonna sweat you 
 I'm all on your timeline reading all those facts 
 We had about each other won't be the same between me and you 
 Now you wanna work it out 
 What is there to talk about 
 Talking about what you gonna do 
 Girl you better shut your mouth 
 So goodluck with your next dude
