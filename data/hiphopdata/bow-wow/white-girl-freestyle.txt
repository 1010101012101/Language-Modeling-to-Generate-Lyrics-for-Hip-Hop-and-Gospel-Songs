 Nigga sit back and watch me

 One dark skin fat booty and a red boned 
 You know it's going down 
 Like Yung Joc 
 And I don't give a damn if you like me or not 
 See you can never play me 'cause I'm from the O 
 Like Ice Cube I gets dough

 Orange Lamborghini looking like Halloween 
 And when I step out 
 You know I'm stepping out clean 
 Ya boy stay fresh yes

 And the chain stay shiny 
 'Cause I spent 200 hundred G's 
 And if you got a man

 So why you don't you drop him and come and roll with me? 
 He give you ten minutes 
 An I'm an all nighter 
 And I'm gon beat it up 
 Baby like a street fighter 
 I heard a lot of flows 
 But mine is much tighter 
 And I ain't even got to use a damn ghost writer 
 Ya boy so hot I put the sun out of business 
 And if it's brand new then you know that I'm in it 
 I'm at the mall err day 
 So you know I kill it 
 Nudy jeans, polo tee that how ya boy stay fitted 
 You bum ass nigga ain't livin' how we living 
 The talented ain't luck homie it was God givin'
