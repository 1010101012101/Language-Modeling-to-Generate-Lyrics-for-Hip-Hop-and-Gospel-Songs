I see you lookin' at me exactly like you know what it do 
 When I leave where I'm at, make my way over to you 
 'Cause I ain't playin' with you, girl 
 (Just want you to know) 
 I ain't playin' 
 If I whisper in your ear what's goin' through in my in my head, baby 
 I bet you turn around an' tell me, "Baby let's leave" 
 Any girl JD used to bring around I had a crush on 
 Wishin' I could take 'em to my room and get my touch on 
 "If you was just a lil' older", is what they used to say 
 Kissin' me, huggin', callin' me 'Baby', how they use to play 
 But now that I am 21, if you go to kissin' an' huggin' me 
 Lil mami, I'm trying to cop sumtin', I'm in da club now tearin' up 
 Tank top, standin' on da couch screamin', "Who bet I can't stop" 
 Album number 7 started at 11, steady youngest nigga killin' it 
 Shawty, you better tell 'em uh 
 Used to be your lil sister that I was concerned about 
 Now I want you, I see you lookin', now I'ma thug it out 
 Don't slip, look again, girl, if you do I'm goin' in 
 Tell 'em lil mama what you waitin' for, I just want you to know 
 I ain't playin', I ain't playin', girl, you already know 
 I see you lookin' at me exactly like you know what it do 
 When I leave where I'm at, make my way over to you 
 'Cause I ain't playin' with you, girl 
 (Just want you to know) 
 I ain't playin' 
 If I whisper in your ear what's goin' through into my head, baby 
 I bet you turn around an' tell me, "Baby, let's leave" 
 If you a fly young chick, I'm a fly young nigga 
 Plenty dudes make fake us but nobody got a swag like mine 
 Feelin' horny girl, I know you want me girl 
 I'm 'bout to tell you what I'm thinking, baby, close your eyes 
 I'm right here, baby, I'm in your ear, baby 
 Let's make a movie, need to get that ass in here, baby 
 I like to drink a lot, let's take it to my spot 
 Soon as we hit the door, we're gonna drink some more 
 And I'm a kiss you here and I'm a kiss you derr 
 And I'm a kiss ya, kiss ya, kiss ya 
 Kiss ya everywhere 
 (Bow Wow) 
 Said I'm a kiss you derr and I'm a kiss ya, kiss ya, kiss ya 
 Kiss ya everywhere 
 I see you lookin' at me, exactly like you know what it do 
 When I leave where I'm at, make my way over to you 
 'Cause I ain't playin' with you, girl 
 (I just want you to know) 
 I ain't playin' 
 If I whisper in your ear what's goin' through in my in my head, baby 
 I bet you turn around an' say, "Baby, let's leave" 
 They say rockstars live da life, but I beg to differ 
 Tommy Lee and Nikki sumtin' ain't got shit on this nigga 
 From some Playboy Bunnies girls with their own money 
 Got 'em so backed up in my sidekick it ain't funny 
 Got 'em high enough in parties, sometimes keep da red carpet 
 'Cause I don't know how to stop it once I get it started 
 I go hard, go hard when I'm in da paint 
 Quick to let you know I'm errthing that your nigga ain't 
 If he ain't got a mil' ticket, a mansion and a condo 
 Fleet full of cars, then you need to let your man go 
 This ain't 'bout da money, baby, this about a good time 
 And I ain't trying to replace your man 
 I'm just talking 'bout this one time 
 And your mind saying no but your body saying yes 
 How you droppin' in that dress and your eyes tell the rest 
 So don't slip 
 (Jecho) 
 Look again 
 (Jecho) 
 Girl, if you do, I'm goin' in
