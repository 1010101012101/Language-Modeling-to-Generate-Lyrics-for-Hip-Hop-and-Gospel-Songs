I told y'all I'm the best of 2009 man 
 On me 
 B to the mother fuckin' wow 
 I'm the best fuck the rest 
 I'm the hottest nigga doin' it 
 Lambo coupe in it 
 Dark tick got 'em light 
 Hue in it 
 This LBW 
 And you rack around ruing 
 6 carat stones yup I got that heavy ear 
 By 2010 
 Ima make Jermaine a billionaire 
 Don't compare these rappers to me 
 Enough said they don't even stand a chance 
 Like a nigga with no legs look 
 I'm in the range 
 Catch me dippin switchin lanes 
 No in flight dining 
 Got the chef on the plan 
 On my way to Hollywood 
 Bout to take a movie meeting 
 Tryna be will smith 
 Look out for hurricane season 
 Hehe 
 I like coffee with money 
 I got heavy cream 
 White polo v-neck with the Louie jeans 
 And most of these rap niggas is just make believes 
 U see this much ice not even watchin a make believe 
 Haha look 
 Used to be the daughters 
 But now a day it's the grown ones smashing all the mamas 
 I know where the money at so I don't need a compass 
 6 1 4 
 All day dats Columbus 
 Wat 
 U niggas know I'm big time all my shows be packed 
 Like the school lunch line 
 And the boy bow real sick with the punch line 
 I ain't gotta say that I'm the best but one time 
 Sipping ass niggas stay cuffing like one time 
 Not flip mode but I get paid when I bus a rhyme 
 Damn 
 Call me Lamborghini moss 
 Trick talk slick watch Ur ass get slapped wit a paw print 
 So I hope you got George bush reflexes 
 And like LA 
 U ain't dodging these 
 Call me bow wheeze 
 SSD make girls get week in the knees 
 Like SWV 
 I'm in the hum v 
 Ur baby mama love me 
 And when we have sex we gotta change all the sheets 
 Don't worry when we doing it 
 The kids be sleep 
 And if these niggas is sick then I'm HIV 
 Bow hahaha

 {Talkin'?}

 Jumpin' out the window with this one
