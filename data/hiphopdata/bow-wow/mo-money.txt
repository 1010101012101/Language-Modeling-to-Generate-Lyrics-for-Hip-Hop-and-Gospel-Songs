(Verse 1- Bow Wow) 
 I'm that girl loving, car dubbin', rims scubbing, teen 
 I've been bad to the bone, since I stepped on the scene 
 I've been club ready, 'bout my feady, game so mean 
 Hypnotizing these hoes, like they gone off that lean 
 I'm that track flippin, up one dippin, he can do whatever man 
 If you 12in this, man then I know that's what your sayin' 
 I'm the house-wrecker, mic-checker, Homie with a plan 
 If I said it, then I did it, Lil nigga, I'm the man, 
 I'm that trend-settin', big-bettin', always lookin' Fly 
 I'm That cocky, poppin', ain't no stoppin', reachin' for the sky 
 I'm a boss playa, baby ain't another like I 
 Screamin' live homie; "you can't take it with you when you die" 
 C'mon 
 I got that '09 flow 
 Girls beatin' down my dow (door) 
 With me that's how it goes 
 A Hundred Thou' a show 
 Me making records, movies, and TV shows 
 It equals MO MONEY, MO MONEY, MO MONEY, MO MONEY, MO MONEY, 
 Ooh 
 I got that '09 flow 
 Girls beatin' down my dow 
 With me that's how it goes 
 A Hundred Thou' a show 
 Me making records, movies, and TV shows 
 It equals MO MONEY, MO MONEY, MO MONEY, MO MONEY, MONEY, 
 Ooh 
 (Verse 2- T. Waters) 
 (Hey, hey) 
 I'm that flame spittin', Yank fitted leanin to the side 
 24 pendent door, folks leanin in the ride 
 Rims spinnin', Hoes grinnin', you know what it is 
 My flow to the dow, walls movin in the crib 
 "Where you live?" 
 Nah nigga, mind ya business, you probably wouldn't even find the shit 
 Diamond rings, hood rich, like it's something bitch, and ima have a lil fun with this 
 I'm a straight better, game checker, "put-her-in-her-place" 
 So poof, yeah she disappear, gone without a trace 
 Summer rockin' the black Prada kicks without the lace, 
 The Dirty, just ain't the Dirty, lil dirrty, without the base 
 Niggas So So Def, them niggas is gettin' cake 
 2005, Young and Fly and Flashy up in your face 
 HAH! 
 (Verse 3- Bow Wow) 
 I'm that country talking, sea-walking, youngin with the bounce 
 I got girls and money coming at me the same in large amounts 
 I'm that chain swingin', heat bring, problem for the rest of y'all 
 It's like this shorty, drop come and get with me if you want to ball 
 Car switchin by the day, stuttin' all through the A 
 Hands up crunk like lil scrappy "OKAY-K-K" 
 I'ma genius like Ray, for my downfall niggas pray, but I 
 Careless what a nigga might say, especially when they keep tryin' to get in my way 
 New sneakers, pockets way deeper than yours 
 I'm a junkie for this, you can smell it coming out of my pores 
 Unlike y'all lil homies, I'm getting up out of the stores 
 I got a lot but I'm still tryin' to get get get get me, get me some more
