Uh huh 
 C, I ain't afraid to let the whole world know 
 Know what I'm sayin' 
 You could call me Bow Wow 
 But tonight, I'm Lamborghini Moss 
 Real special occasion, you know? 
 And pain, let's go get 'em again, hommie 
 Lil' mama bad man she fine 
 She a dime, she a problem 
 Bedroom time, boy I make her 
 Yell like the Khaled 
 So good, check her swag 
 Unlike anything I had 
 Red American express 
 Get what you want, got every bag 
 Niggas mad say I'm slippin' her girls think she trippin' 
 We don't even feed in to that bull 
 Like Jordan and pippin', don't be trippin' 
 When she here, I'm at the club with other women 
 When I be out on tour 
 She be the only thing I'm missing 
 Late night she hit my sidekick 
 Like, Bow, come over 
 Treat her like a fourth quarter 
 And put that D on her 
 She put up with all my bullshit 
 And all of my drama 
 And I know that she the one 
 Because I let her meet my mama 
 She's my only love, she's my 
 And when I'm gone, girl, I miss you 
 Can't nobody do me like you, shawty 
 She's my only love 
 She's my only love, she's my 
 She hold me down, everybody knows 
 She model 'round town, come on 
 She's my only love 
 See, that's my girl 
 I ain't afraid to let the whole world know 
 Nigga trying to holla but she know they like 
 Can't no other nigga do it like this mane 
 I done been with a lot of girls in my lifetime 
 But this right here, this the real thing 
 I spoil her, adore her 
 Give her cash to go to the mall a 
 My ride or die my down ass 
 Like destiny, I'm her soldier 
 When she be feeling down 
 I give her lovin', I mean all of it 
 She my lil' bust it, baby 
 Like ne-yo and plies and them 
 Look good when she walkin' 'round my crib 
 In them boy shorts wife B 
 And when I lick that spot 
 See, she get real moist 
 Catered food on a jet 
 Me and her be takin' trips 
 Passport full of stamps 
 Been to every continent 
 She all mine, she so fine 
 And girls like this so hard to find 
 That's why I knew 
 First day I saw shit, I had to make her mine 
 She's my only love, she's mine 
 And when I'm gone, girl, I miss you 
 Can't nobody do me like you, shawty 
 She's my only love 
 She's my only love, she's my 
 She hold me down, everybody know 
 She model 'round town come on 
 She's my only love 
 See that's my girl ain't afraid 
 To let the whole world know 
 I tried, guys
