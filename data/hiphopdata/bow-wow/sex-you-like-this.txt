Cuff your chick 
 It won't take for you to get it up 
 I got that long stroke I can go deep enough 
 So come here shawty let me lay you down 
 And let me show you what I'm all about 
 Bring your camera we gon' have some fun 
 And she know Bow got that tornado tongue 
 I don't think that you can handle it 
 Shawty can you drive a stick 
 Drive me outta this world man 
 And she bad and damn she thick 
 Do he sex you like this 
 Do he sex you like that (x4) 
 Come on let make love what you trippin' bout 
 Now don't be scared once I whip it out 
 She give me head till I pass out 
 Pullin on her head tryin' not to pull her track out 
 I know you want it from the back 
 I know you like it like that 
 Bitin all over while she scratchin on my back 
 Do he sex you like this 
 Do he sex you like that (x4) 
 Oh Turn off the lights, the lights, the lights 
 Tu-turn off the lights, the lights, the lights (x3) 
 Do he sex you like this 
 Do he sex you like that (x4) 
 I'm saying, any time you need it then 
 You can just pick up the phone and call, 
 And there's no problem 'cause I 
 Do he sex you like this (let's go) 
 Do he sex you like that (that's right)
