 Tellin' all her friends in the benz 
 He don't really look 16 do he? 
 112, youngest thing on the scene 
 Don't believe when I seen how she squeezed in them jeans 
 Looks like a tight situation 
 Make a young man make flight reservations 
 Just step, no intimidations 
 I'm bow wow, boo accept no immitations 
 Shoulda seen the looks on they faces 
 But ice plus light makes for good conversation 
 You tellin' me, it's a felony to yell at me

 But luckily 
 She stayed for some therapy 
 I stay pimpin' heavily
