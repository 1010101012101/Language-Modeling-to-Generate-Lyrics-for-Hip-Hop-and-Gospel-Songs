Here we go 
 Woooohooooooo 
 Big money just entered the room 
 Louis V. shades bitch check out my cool (fresh) 
 Yeah, even back in grade school 
 I was the most popular so damn tight 
 And all the bullshits and politics that come with the game 
 Old ass executives don't know a thing 
 About the music I make 
 Haters don't know how much work it takes 
 Yeah, to be the best 
 I guess I gotta work harder 
 Outwork Mr. Carter 
 And you can call me Mr. I'mma Go Harder 
 Shittin' on these niggas givin' facials to their daughters 
 They're tryin' to count me out they full of doubt 
 I'm sittin' at the top bitch I might need an extra couch 
 Yeah, I'm 'bout to shake the game up 
 Before you talk to me play pitcher and get you change up 
 To my haters, you can suck a dick shovel shit 
 I'mma piss 'em off even more know why 
 'Cause I'mma 
 Go Harder 
 Go Harder 
 Go Harder 
 Go Harder 
 Yeah, and when you think you ain't nothin' 
 Don't let them haters get to you say I'mma be somethin' 
 And I'mma 
 Go Harder 
 Go Harder 
 Go Harder 
 Go Harder 
 Yeah, now talk a walk in my shoes 
 Do you see what I see do you see my fuse 
 Yeah, I like to smoke a lil' weed 
 Lots of tattoos who are they to judge me 
 I'm only twenty two but looks like I done it all 
 But I got so much to prove but yet so much to lose 
 Cause this is my destiny 
 Be damned if I let a bitch nigga get the best of me 
 I swear I'm so determined 
 Money longer than your pastor's sermen 
 And I'm hot like when you leave that perm in 
 Don't play with my money boy you heard what big worm said 
 And I was built Ford tough 
 It ain't nothin' that you can say that gonna break or bust 
 My spirit, my pride, my high 
 Do I think I'm the best thing out motherfucker shawty ride
