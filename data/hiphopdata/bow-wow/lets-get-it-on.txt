Do it for the ladies baby 
 Shawty so bad 
 Shawty so fly 
 Just wanna get to know 
 Don't wanna take up your time 
 Baby what you drinking? 
 Shawty I'll buy that 
 I'll buy the whole damn bar 
 Gotta black card girl they can't deny that 
 Got a feeling that you coming on 
 Gotta be faithful 'cause she got a man at home 
 And I ain't tryna knock that 
 Ridin' with the top back how you gon' top that 
 Because you rollin' with a baller 
 Hit the mall whenever you wanna 
 And everything on me 
 Right here is where you need to be 
 See a lot of ladies in here but I only want you girl 
 And when it's time to go I'm leaving this club with you girl 
 I wanna take you home get you all alone 
 It's just us baby we can be grown 
 And I'm down for whatever she down for whatever 
 Well baby let's get it on. 
 (2nd Verse) 
 Now we back at the condo 
 Sippin' on ciroc now 
 Shawty is you comfortable 
 'Cause I'm bout to pull your top down 
 Sorry I'm man-ish 
 Working with a monster can you handle it 
 Baby I know you got it like a pro 
 Get on top drop it real slow 
 'Cause I can change your life 
 All in one swipe 
 She tell me she ain't met a man who can treat her right 
 But lemme say you're done looking after tonight 
 Cancel that nigga you don't need him in your life 
 Because you got me size gon' be 
 You ain't gotta pay everything on me 
 Told you right here's where you need to be 
 She fucking with the team... CMB. 
 See a lot of ladies in here but I only want you girl 
 And when it's time to go I'm leaving this club with you girl 
 I wanna take you home get you all alone 
 It's just us baby we can be grown 
 And I'm down for whatever she down for whatever 
 Well baby let's get it on. 
 (3rd Verse) 
 I know what you thinking that this is just another one night stand 
 And I know that you think that all man are the same but I'm not your average man 
 We can take your time ?? your mind we ain't gotta rush 
 ??????????? Just some wine (baby) 
 It's hard for me to keep my hands off her 'cause she so fine 
 See a lot of ladies in here but I only want you girl 
 And when it's time to go I'm leaving this club with you girl 
 I wanna take you home get you all alone 
 It's just us baby we can be grown 
 And I'm down for whatever she down for whatever 
 Well baby let's get it on.
