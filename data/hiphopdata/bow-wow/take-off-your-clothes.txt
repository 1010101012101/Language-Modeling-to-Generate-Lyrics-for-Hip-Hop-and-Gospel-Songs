All My Niggas Say 
 All My ladies Say 
 (Verse 1: Bow Wow) 
 I ain't gon front baby girl I'm quite manished 
 Anything ya throw at me I bet that I can handle it 
 Bed Springs bouncin' got that head board crackin' 
 Knockin' pictures off ya wall guaranteed satisfaction 
 We can do it in the shower Bow goes for hours 
 Hit that spot make her scream my name louder 
 Heat it on up like an Everlast punchin' bag 
 Got a tongue ring and she knows just what to do wit dat Now. 
 Take them panties and drop them low 
 Bald Top like a real girls suppose to 
 Ya need some assistance girl ill show ya 
 Help You remove that bra off ya shoulders 
 We can go all night do anything ya like 
 Make ya toes curl when I go downtown
