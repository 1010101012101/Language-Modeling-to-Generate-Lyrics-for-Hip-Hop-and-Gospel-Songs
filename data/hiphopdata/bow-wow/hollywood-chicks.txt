Verse- 'cause I sit back relax get my hair corn-rolled 
 Thinking 'bout the little honey's that I wanna know 
 Raven symone kinda grown holla back 
 I wanna go one on one with kyla pratt 
 Picture that what would her moms say 
 Kiss solange and turn her into beyonce 
 'Cause I'm a mack no trivia to that 
 Nivea cleaning my throwbacks in laundrymats 
 And I'm a g her every time I see her 
 Squeeze 3LW up into my 2 seater 
 Christina milian is the bomb as she move her body like a snake ma 
 Jennifer freeman got kicked from the crib 
 She was talking bout some wife and kids 
 Meagan good if I could then I would 
 You say you won't but I really think you should 
 Show my rims to the olsen twins 
 Looked at each other and they both got thin 
 'Cause I'm a pimp 
 I feed 'em lobster and shrimp 
 Well you know it's just a rhyme I don't mean no offense 
 Chorus- I got dreams of bagging a Hollywood chick 
 I'm just playing but I'm saying 
 Dreams of bagging a Hollywood chick 
 I'm just playing but I'm saying 
 Verse- picture me and pamela lee in a drop (hop in bow) 
 I show her how a real kid rock 
 Me and kelis on the beach having fun 
 Her cell rung 9-1-1 it's God's son 
 I don't hate I just wait to they really ready 
 I told usher I got it bad for chilli (ooh) 
 Told jermaine me and janet had a thang 
 He couldn't understand so I had to explain 
 I said look our size is the same 
 But I'm way cuter 
 It was easier to scoop her 
 Now she's gone 
 Chante moore's on the phone 
 Now kenny lattimore cries all alone 
 Brad pitt started a fight club again 
 Cause me and jennifer aniston real close friends 
 J.lo I don't know 
 I don't wanna go where everybody's been 
 Affleck who's next 
 Forget your chain I snatch your bra from your neck 
 Eric benet, banet mmm be not 
 You the x-man I'm all that halle's got 
 Type of man that tamia deserves 
 So you can keep grant on the injured reserve
