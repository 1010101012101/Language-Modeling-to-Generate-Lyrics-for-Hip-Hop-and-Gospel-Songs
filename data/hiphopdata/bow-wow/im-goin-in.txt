.Bow Wow. 
 Money to the ceilin 
 I'm lamborgini whippin 
 And I can make a moutha fuckin' million in a minute 
 My girl is dominic 
 I swear my flow the illest 
 And all I do is floss you can even ask my dentist 
 Bow be on that other shit 
 All the hoes lovin' it 
 Bought two phantoms in one day for the fuck of it 
 Iced out rolley 
 Ballin like ginovi 
 You so local over seas know me 
 Treat me like a trouper baby girl and just blow me 
 Got a badd white bitch and she know kobe 
 Say you gettin' money moutha fucka then show me 
 Kush got me so high I'm sittin' in the nose bleeds 
 Rap beefs I ain't gone particapate in none of that 
 All white tee blue jeans with a fitted cap 
 Always finish first place columbus is my birth place 
 Buzz bigger then when r kelly dropped the sex tape 
 I keep it real niggas know the deal 
 Money on my mind I'm thinkin' ima get another mill 
 And I don't pay for girls they let me fuck for free 
 Got girls on my twitter sayin' how they love fuckin' me 
 How they love suckin me 
 These girls can't get enough of me 
 These hoes be steady cuffin me 
 They hands all down my dungari 
 Was little bow wow now I'm just bow now 
 Big faces small faces money tall as yao now 
 Ya baby momma jockin me she won't give me my privacy 
 Stuntin like dwight up in the paint ain't no stoppin' me 
 (Hey who you is) mr. 106 is back 
 I'm cleaned then a bitch like they ran me through a laundramat
