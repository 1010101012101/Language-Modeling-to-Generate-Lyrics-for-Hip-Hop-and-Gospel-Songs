The ring nigga yeah 
 It's my shawty right there 
 She in that brand new mercades 
 I'm the president so that makes her my first lady 
 And I keep her fresh, her shoe game is crazy 
 And I could brawl out for a dog, that's my baby 
 Fresh manicure and her nails got rinestones 
 Coke bottle shape with a caramel skin tone 
 And she be lovin' when I'm blowin' her back out 
 Pullin on her hair, I'm tryin' not pull a track out 
 Jus like birds do you know I go down south 
 Do the thing wit my tongue, you know wat I'm talkin' bout 
 Hood wit a little class, real cute wit alotta ass 
 Make a nigga spend all his cash, lets go

 Roofless, I love it when they say 
 Heard you was lookin' for the big bad wolf 
 I mean the bad bitch from the big apple 
 I mean I make it pop like snap crackle 
 Lets hit that chaple, and go get a castle 
 U know I'm a queen but I let the king dome 
 'Cause it is goin' down like syndrome 
 U could be fred I'll be wilma flinstone 
 And fuck them other bitches 
 They could buy ya ringtone 
 'Cause you know I get wetter than a juice box 
 When I say who got the juice, I ain't talkin' bout tupac 
 Sex game cold I need a hoodie 
 I can give you somthin way better than them goodies (my goodies)

 (Hold on nicki lemme holla at ya baby) 
 You know ??? ??? fine dime for me 
 And when a nigga in the mood she can put it on me 
 She in the kitchen like a d boy she puts it down 
 She know my style so she don't like no other girls around 
 Nieghbors complain 'cause at night we make alotta noise 
 After sex she make me tacos like on baby boy 
 She love a nigga to make her feel comfortable 
 Me and you can have a family like the huxtables 
 Can't lie ya back rubs make me feel good 
 That bath and body works got you smellin real good 
 And if I ever got in trouble she take the charge 
 Now that's real shit see how much she love the dog
