F/ R.O.C. 
 Have you ever seen me 
 I'm the future 
 I represent how it's gone be 
 I'm the future 
 Born in 1987 
 I'm the future 
 Party people get ready 
 I'm the future 
 I don't know about y'all, but I know about me 
 And when you think about the future I'm all you see 
 'Cause I'm the future. 
 Verse 1-bow wow

 For the block every jam I make 
 You gotta go knock knock the biggest thang since hugo 
 You know y'all cats do a whole lot

 Like the juice now 
 Back in '73 y'all heard of me 
 Had to I'm that lil bad dude 
 Running around putting it down with jd

 Verse 2 R.O.C. 
 Now look up ahead that's me 
 Far beyond the the flow was gone 
 Come on you know the kid is crazy 
 Like britney spears and I'm in the prime of my years 
 Oh yeah I know what pops up in ya head first 
 Wait a minute how he keep comin' up with verses 
 Well I'ma tell you something don't get nervous 
 My secret is I'm doing it on purpose 
 Why 
 To get a billion copies purchased 
 If your styles sick mines must be allergic 
 My rhymes and the beat merges like innerstate traffic 
 Oh my bad 
 It's just a habit I flows it I know it a probably 
 Be a 3 before them o's before you even close to me 
 To see o r even backwards I'm hard and I give my reguards 
 But I'm ain't rapping with y'all I'm a year after the mark 
 Have you ever seen me

 I represent how it's gone be 
 I'm the future 
 Born in uh '79 
 I'm the future 
 Party people get ready I'm the future 
 I'm the future
