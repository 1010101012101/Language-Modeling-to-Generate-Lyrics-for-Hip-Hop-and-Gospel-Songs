Now we we be chillin' we be vibing out 
 Because I'm famous me and shortie gotta hide out 
 Kinda new to her but she gonna get used to it 
 She know no nigga do it like I do it 
 Lil mama short on the rent well I take care of that 
 That's just some chump change you ain't gotta pay me back 
 I've seen alot of women in my life but you the coldest 
 Test me and pop when I ain't with you 'cause I want you closer 
 Shortie what you need? 
 Cause baby you can have it all 
 You wont be needing those baby 
 Shortie just take it off 
 My hands on you 
 Your hands on me 
 Trying to hold my composure 
 Of what it's gonna be 
 Hey pretty lady 
 (Da-da-damn girl you're fine) 
 Hey pretty lady 
 (I know you hear that all the time) 
 Man shortie so fine 
 She can have wutever she wants 
 Tell them other fellas like heinz 
 They can catch up/ketchup 
 I'm balling hard contently there ain't nothing like me at all 
 Those shopping malls we shopping outta designer catalogue 
 The big pimpin' over there baby this is where you wanna be 
 I do this all year baby ignore the rumors you ain't got nothing to fear baby 
 Can't listen to your ladies 'cause they can't keep their man can't they 
 Shortie what you need? 
 Cause baby you can have it all 
 You wont be needing those baby 
 Shortie just take it off 
 My hands on you 
 Your hands on me 
 Trying to hold my composure 
 Of what it's gonna be 
 Hey pretty lady 
 (Da-da-damn girl you're fine) 
 Hey pretty lady 
 (I know you hear that all the time) 
 Quit that whenever we chillin' 
 I told my self id never let a woman get my feelings 
 My homies making fun of me fuck it I know she got me 
 Plus she said I hit that pussy like nobody 
 Hot body the illest nigga she ever met 
 Never miss a flight got my own jet 
 Which means we can retreat wherever 
 Snowy or sunny weather 
 You rolling with the dawg it gets no better 
 Shortie what you need? 
 Cause baby you can have it all 
 You wont be needing those baby 
 Shortie just take it off 
 My hands on you 
 Your hands on me 
 Trying to hold my composure 
 Of what it's gonna be 
 Hey pretty lady 
 (Da-da-damn girl you're fine) 
 Hey pretty lady 
 (I know you hear that all the time)
