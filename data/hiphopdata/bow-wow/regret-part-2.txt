I wanna welcome you to this shad moss album 
 Sit back relax 
 While I do this... 
 I can't lie man there's some stuff that I regret 
 Like lettin my fans down and cheating on my ex right 
 But I'm young so what, yeah ima make mistakes 
 And besides nobody's perfect any fucking way 
 Ha, I swear to god the press be all on me (yeah) 
 Oscar mire bloggers, everything they write is baloney 
 And why I feel like I got the whole world on me 
 Got all the money in the world, but yet I'm still lonely 
 And why the fuck my best friend had to steal from me 
 Couldn't keep it real so for that, I had to leave Sony 
 Sometimes I wanna quit rap like I'm through with it 
 Why I don't get my respect, and why they still act like I'm new to this 
 They hate because I'm fly, shoulda came with a steward's 
 When I did that show with omarion, I was losing it ha 
 I'm on BET acting an asshole, fighting with the interviewers, why I do that for 
 I can't lie I was drugged out, sipping syrup, smoking weed shit had me bugged out 
 Even Jermaine didn't know who I was 
 He know me best he been around me since day one 
 An I relation shit homie never changed 
 You can ask him, I'm still mr money ain't a thang 
 Got homies back at home talkin' bout he done changed 
 Lil arrogant bastard, he don't act the same 
 Who really write his shit is it tip or is it Wayne 
 Is it Bret is it Jermaine, will y'all let me do my thang 
 Ha I don't even know what the big deal is 
 I'm writing for myself, y'all niggas needa feel this
