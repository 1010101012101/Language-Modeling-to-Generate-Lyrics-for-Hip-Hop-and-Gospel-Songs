Do it for the lady's 
 Here we go 
 They say age ain't nothin' but a number right 
 I know just what you need 
 I know just what you like 
 Now baby dim the light 'n' get comfortable 
 I got enough dick to fill you up like papa dos 
 That grown man talk baby let's just keep real 
 And I ain't no magician but let cop a field 
 Baby my love is real tell me where you want it at 
 And she know my game sharper than a pack of thumbtacks 
 Baby let me tell you where you can put yo clothes at 
 Throw dem on the floor 'n' leave yo heels by the doormat 
 Yeah you leavin' here with a sore back 
 Love my dick so much she had to go and get my name tat 
 Shhh break it down I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds 
 This love is a private affair Interrupt the flow, no they better not 
 Dare 
 Um please don't interrupt us 
 Neighbors complaining sayin' we causin a ruckus 
 Just to show you just what kind of mood I'm in 
 I put that tour body callin r.kelly CD in

 Have you running to yo friends tellin' dem what bow like 
 Talkin' to them like that nigga put it down right 
 Had me pent up I swear to god girl I came twice (It's what I do to em)

 Known to drive these lady's crazy they all want to have my baby's (huh?) 
 More than I love her you my homie baby

 Shhh break it down I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds 
 This love is a private affair Interrupt the flow, no they better not 
 Dare 
 Only got eight bars left we running out of time 
 I'm glad I got you yeah you little light of mine 
 I goin' to thinkin' about you when I'm out in town 
 Tell dem other dudes like new edition they can cool it now 
 Becuz you with bow weezy baby it's that simple 
 I love it when you smile it complements your dimples 
 And you know my love is unconditional 
 And for these hoes on the road girl ill never diss u (Never Yeah!)
