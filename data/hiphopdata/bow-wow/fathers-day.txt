Seem like I got everything 
 Only thing I'm really missin' is my father mane 
 Never told me son have a good day in school 
 Never came to my games he too busy sippin bulls 
 Got 3 kids can't take care na one of 'em dead beat said he would I can't be one of em 
 And I look just like him when I have kids I won't be nothin' like him 
 And every time I see him I be wantin to fight to him 
 I love him to death, but he know he triflin 
 Grandma always tryna take ya side sayin' shad he went to rehab he gon be fine 
 But I know deep down in my soul that's lie 
 And I hope he gets better so I pray to the sky 
 Can't even lie man I feel like cryin 
 And you drink so much I know ya body is dying 
 And it'a shame my lil sista in the 6th grade and she know all about ya bad ways and 
 I learned how to use a condom by myself 
 And I learned how shave homie by myself 
 Taught me how to be man by myself 
 And I tie my own shoe homie I don't need ya help 
 Man what I'm gon tell my children 
 When they ask for grandpa and you somewhere missin' 
 It's too late homie don't even bother 
 You know how much stress you done caused my momma 
 Cause you wasn't around it was so much drama 
 Think pickin' up a 40 gon solve ya probelms 
 Try talkin' to you but don't change much 
 Gave you some money but you fucked that all up 
 And you know I love holidays but fathers day the only holiday we don't celebrate 
 Me and my fans got something in common just ya momma around and ain't no father (true) 
 And I know it's good dad out there but 
 I wouldn't understand I didn't have that dad 
 And he's a mess like lynel and when he see me on TV that's when he call 
 Mr right by my side is where he oughta be 
 Can't do it 'cause he still an alcoholic be 
 This concludes my story 
 God bless ya soul and God give him glory 
 I celebrate holidays but I don't celebrate Father's Day x4
