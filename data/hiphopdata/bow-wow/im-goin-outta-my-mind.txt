I'm going outta my mind my mind 
 Trying to juggle being a celebrity and living all of my life there? 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind my mind 
 Trying to just being with one woman instead of havin' five 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind 
 Man it's hard to trust anybody I don't trust these niggas 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind 
 Beathing these front days see my views come and walk in my shoes 
 Niggas want favors niggas want hand outs 
 Mandatory for me to help my man's out 
 Got niggas in and outta jail paying all their lawyer fees 
 And you'd think all this shit be far away from me 
 And I'm smokin' even more now my city thinkin' I've turned on 'em 
 Never was the case and I'm a always have love for 'em 
 Trying to digest all of this pressure 
 Too young to be going through under pressure 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind 
 Trying to juggle being a celebrity and living all of my life there? 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind my mind 
 Trying to just being with one woman instead of havin' five 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind 
 Man it's hard to trust anybody I don't trust these niggas 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind 
 Beathing these front days see my views come and walk in my shoes 
 I got a girl I'm trying to lock down trying to do my grown man 
 Dealing with depression I done felt that with my best friend 
 Got 2 sisters ain't seen them forever 
 Havent spoken to my grandmother I know she feels neglected 
 Just because you see me go hard pop bottles don't mean I don't have bad days 
 My own problems shiit 23 years old 
 But sometimes I feel liked I've been here before 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind 
 Trying to juggle being a celebrity and living all of my life there? 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind my mind 
 Trying to just being with one woman instead of havin' five 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind 
 Man it's hard to trust anybody I don't trust these niggas 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind 
 Beathing these front days see my views come and walk in my shoes 
 Everytime I was 22 shit got hectic 
 Biggest call of my life I never would forget this 
 I'm on the movie set I get a call my girl pregnant 
 Holding my composuree but I'm feeling breathless 
 Thinkin' bout my fans thinkin' bout my careers 
 Tryin' to make the best move what do I do from here 
 So much lying on this young man 
 It's even crazy when you got the world in your hands 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind 
 Trying to juggle being a celebrity and living all of my life there? 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind my mind 
 Trying to just being with one woman instead of havin' five 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind 
 Man it's hard to trust anybody I don't trust these niggas 
 I'm going outta my mind my mind my mind 
 Beathing these front days see my views come and walk in my shoes 
 (Bridge: talking in background) 
 It ain't easy being me 
 Packets of celebritys more than heavily 
 It ain't easy being me 
 Packets of celebritys more than heavily 
 It ain't easy being me 
 Packets of celebritys more than heavily 
 It ain't easy being me 
 Packets of celebritys more than heavily
