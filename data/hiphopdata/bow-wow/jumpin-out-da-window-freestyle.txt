Ok, B to the motherfuckin Wow 
 I'm the best fuck the rest 
 I'm the hottest nigga doing it 
 Lambo coupein it 
 Dark tip, got 'em like whoin it 
 Diss LBW and your rap career I'll ruin it 
 6 carrat stones, yeah I got a heavy ear 
 By 2010 imma make Jermaine a billionaire 
 Don't compare these rappers to me 
 Nuff said 
 They don't even stand a chance 
 Like a nigga with no legs 
 Look I'm in the range 
 Trust me dippin, switchin lanes 
 No inflight dining got the chef on the plane 
 On my way to Hollywood 
 Bout to take a movie meeting 
 Tryna be Will Smith 
 Look out for Hurricane Season 
 I'm like coffee with the money 
 I got heavy cream, white polo, v neck with the Luis jeans 
 And most of these rap niggas is just make believe 
 They seen this much ice not even watchin the make believes 
 Look, used to be the daughters 
 But now a days since I'm grown I'm smashin all the mamas 
 I know where the money at so I don't need a compass 
 614 all day that's Columbus 
 What? You niggas know I'm big time 
 All my shows be packed like the school lunch line 
 And the boy Bow real sick with the punch lines 
 I ain't got to say that I'm the best but one time 
 Sippin niggas stay cuffin like one time 
 Not flip lo but I get paid when I bust a rhyme 
 Damn, call me Lamborghini Moss 
 Trick talk slick watch your ass get slapped with a paw print 
 So I hope you got George Bush reflexes 
 And like LA you ain't got your knees 
 Call me Bow Weez 
 SSD make girls get weak in the knees 
 Like S Dub V 
 I'm in the hum v your baby mama love me 
 And when we have sex we gotta change all the sheets 
 Don't worry when we doing it 
 The kids be sleeping 
 If these niggas are sick 
 Then I'm HIV Boww 
 Yeah, don't forget the Wow nigga
