When I was 8 I was rhymin' not back yard game playin' 
 Watchin' Snoop anxiously and waitin' for my chance man 
 Hot and cocky wit it 'cause I know' that I am man 
 I'm goin' down in history like American Bandstand 
 I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man 
 I stay on the top 'cause I keep comin' wit dope man 
 U steady watchin' stealin' but there ain't no hope man 
 U dealin' wit somethin' bigger than the US Open 
 And ain't no jokin' 
 Fresh like Fatlaces and dukey ropes and I keep on smokin' 
 Young but I'm ready so that means I'm strokin' 
 If you pet me now'days girl a dawg is soakin' 
 Addicted to it, JD say I got it bad 
 18 nigga makin' more than yo dad, see 
 They think they doin' it, but I'ma outdo 'em 
 If you know somebody like that, pull up and say to 'em 
 Ye ain't ridin', ye ain't ridin' 
 Ye ain't bumpin' like I'm bumpin' 
 Ye ain't sayin' nothin' homie 
 Ye ain't fresh azimiz 
 Ye ain't got it, ye ain't got it 
 U don't keep it thuggin' like I keep it thuggin' 
 Lil' buddy you ain't fresh azimiz 
 Ye ain't big big whipping 
 Steady t-tippin' 
 No girl getting' homie 
 U ain't fresh azimiz 
 Think you is, think ya is 
 But you ain't, but you ain't 
 Think you get it crunk like me, but you can't 
 Now, now, now, now e'ry record that I make 
 I'm tryin' to get up out the store man 
 E'ry car I drive I'm tryin' have you sayin', "Whoa man" 
 Fourth album comeback power like Rogaine 
 Records say Columbia, but I'm so so man 
 I stay on my grind rakin' in that dough man 
 From records to movies now a TV show man 
 Anything given to me I'm gon' rep man 
 Big house, big cars, what you expect man? 
 Just to get a glimpse, girls breakin' they neck man 
 Blinded by the light glistenin' off the brake lane 
 Bow hot as ever, I ain't lost no step 
 Straight t-shirt, sneakers, I ain't tryin' to go prep 
 Like these lil' R& groups that need my help 
 Wish they had my style, wish they had my rep 
 But oh no, u'll never have it like me man 
 (Oh no) 
 And if you can't understand, this is what I'm sayin' 
 Ye ain't ridin', ye ain't ridin' 
 Ye ain't bumpin' like I'm bumpin' 
 Ye ain't sayin' nothin' homie 
 Ye ain't fresh azimiz 
 Ye ain't got it, ye ain't got it 
 U don't keep it thuggin' like I keep it thuggin' 
 Lil' buddy you ain't fresh azimiz 
 Ye ain't big big whipping 
 Steady t-tippin' 
 No girl getting homie 
 U ain't fresh azimiz 
 Think you is, think ya is 
 But you ain't, but you ain't 
 Think you get it crunk like me, but you can't 
 I got a spot in MIA to get away from the cold weather 
 Talk around town as if I'm wit Ciara 
 Bow fall off, nigga that'll be never 
 I'm rich, yeah I'm rich, I can do whatever 
 I get a kick outta shuttin' suckas down in the parkin' lot 
 Especially when they tryin' to stunt, thinking they hot 
 All out the window talking loud, like they runnin' my block 
 That's when I come through 
 (Come through) 
 And all that stu' 
 (Stu') 
 And ain't another young'n keep it fresh like dis man 
 E'ry year, same time come wit them hits man 
 Tired of makin' girl fall out wit a kiss man 
 Well listen and u're stuck, music just like quicksand 
 Older people say that lil' young dude sick man 
 Young AI and we cool, thick man 
 Difference between me and you is you be Bricklin 
 And I ain't never, ever did that before, no 
 Ye ain't ridin', ye ain't ridin' 
 Ye ain't bumpin' like I'm bumpin' 
 Ye ain't sayin' nothin' homie 
 Ye ain't fresh azimiz 
 Ye ain't got it, ye ain't got it 
 U don't keep it thuggin' like I keep it thuggin' 
 Lil' buddy you ain't fresh azimiz 
 Ye ain't big big whipping 
 Steady t-tippin' 
 No girl getting homie 
 U ain't fresh azimiz 
 Think you is, think ya is 
 But you ain't, but you ain't 
 Think you get it crunk like me, but you can't 
 Ye ain't ridin', ye ain't ridin' 
 Ye ain't bumpin' like I'm bumpin' 
 Ye ain't sayin' nothin' homie 
 Ye ain't fresh azimiz 
 Ye ain't got it, ye ain't got it 
 U don't keep it thuggin' like I keep it thuggin' 
 Lil' buddy you ain't fresh azimiz 
 Ye ain't big big whipping 
 Steady t-tippin' 
 No girl getting homie 
 U ain't fresh azimiz 
 Think you is, think ya is 
 But you ain't, but you ain't 
 Think you get it crunk like me, but you can't
