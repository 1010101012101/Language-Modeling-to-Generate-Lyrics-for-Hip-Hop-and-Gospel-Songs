JD:] Yo Yo Yo (Is IT?) Crazy you hear that 
 That's my man Bow Wow 
 And you know it's off the hook when we up in here 
 So so Def let's go 
 [Verse 1:] Michrophone check one two 
 Ain't nobody comin'like I'm comin' 
 When I come through so get ready I'm the real deal 
 And you can see what I'm sayin' even if you standin' two blocks away 
 I'm from the C.O. and I won' stop (stop) 
 I'm only 14 makin' more than yo pops 
 I'm sayin' you alrady know what 
 I'm about if you don't 
 Take cover cause the dog is out 
 Yu can either flee the scene or keep your frown 
 Better yet find somethn' to do 
 Till I die down and that ain't happening no time soon (why?) 
 'Cause I keep gettin' y'all with the boom 
 It goes back to back we the empire 
 Get out the way or get bnurned by the fire 
 My plans ain't to stay in he racks so run and tell your friends the 
 Phenomenon's back (he's back) 
 [Chorus:] Up in here 
 I know you want me, want me 
 Baby girl here I am come get me 
 Up in here 
 Off the chains and you know I bought Ohio with me I'm 
 Up in here 
 Now get loud jump up off in the crowd 
 Let me see whatcha all about 
 Up in here 
 Now it's my world and all I want to do is see you let the dogs out 
 (Verse 2 (Tigah)) 
 You thinkin' it's a game (uh) 
 Playboy you gotta be a lil bit more realistic 
 And state your claim when I say we off the chains 
 I'm talkin' tigers and dogs not puppy dogs 
 They can't run in this game 
 I'm from to Lauderdale we keep it crackin' 
 Like it ain't nothin' but sucona on 22 
 And gels and an't nothin' you can tell em' 'cause we the future 
 And steaks is high you get stocks you better sell em' 
 'Cause I'm too legit t quit and in a half a year I won't be nothin' to 
 Lick wit' get it lick wit' 
 Now I'm talkin' diffa denz? mercades and benz 
 Trips to swetos? cuties in Switzerland and I still got flow 
 You know that lil black boy when I come around 
 It'like a fshion show wit' Lil Bow Wow (awe yeah) 
 Of corse youknow what I be T-I-G-A-H and I make em' say ah he I'm 
 [Chorus:] Up in here 
 I know you want me, want me 
 Baby girl here I am come get me 
 Up in here 
 Off the chains and you know I bought Ohio with me I'm 
 Up in here 
 Now get loud jump up off in the crowd 
 Let me see whatcha all about 
 Up in here 
 Now it's my world and all I want to do is see you let the dogs out 
 I'm doin' to muc they call me young Walter Payton 
 'Cause I come through the line untouched 
 Then no matter what harm be your pop if the dog lay on it 
 Is going to the top I den change the game 
 I get all the girls even Lil Kim screamin' my name 
 (Uh huh) you can fight it, fight it but try not to like it 
 But you kids'll go crazy if they don't see me I'm 
 So so def till he end around here 
 We hit and do it over again how many can say that 
 How many of y'all at 14 was sittin' back watchin' paper stack 
 It's a know fact that all the greats started this age 
 I in't trynna say that' I'm the greatest yet 
 But I will say I'm goin' down that page 
 [Chorus:] Up in here 
 I know you want me, want me 
 Baby girl here I am come get me 
 Up in here 
 Off the chains and you know I bought Ohio with me I'm 
 Up in here 
 Now get loud jump up off in the crowd 
 Let me see whatcha all about 
 Up in here 
 Now it's my world and all I want to do is see you let the dogs out 
 (JD (spoken)) 
 Let em' cut up in here yo, ah a yeah up in here
