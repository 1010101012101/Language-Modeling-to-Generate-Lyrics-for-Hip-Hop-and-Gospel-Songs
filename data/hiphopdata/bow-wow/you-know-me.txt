Featuring JD and Da Brat 
 (Lil Bow Wow) 
 (You know me) 
 Yo this is Bow Wow, uh-huh 
 (You know me) 
 What can y'all do to me 
 Nothing 
 Shut it all the way down 
 (You know me) 
 Ain't no question I'mm do what I do every trip mama 
 A little pimp 
 (You know me) 
 All I do is find 'em 
 Love 'em and flee 
 It's like that 
 Little cat but I'm nice 
 (You know me) 
 Don't believe please 
 Step, step, step up 
 'Cause I'm bad like Mike 
 (You know me) 
 Bout to watch small change, all change 
 Into big bucks 
 My niggas all we do is put down the smash 
 While y'all playa hataz keep coming with trash 
 I'm everything y'all been looking for 
 Everything that keep y'all straight hitting the floor 
 Little girls in the hood I got 'em all shook up 
 Tryna find this nigga so we can hook up 
 Even girls 18 they be tryna sneak 
 They find all kinds of ways to get next to me 
 I'm the don in this new millennium 
 O-H-I-O is where I'm from 
 I might of said it before but I'mma say it again 
 Since I stepped y'all niggas can't win 
 It's the B-O dub all in the club 
 The reason that girl keep shaking her butt 
 (You know me) 
 Gots to keep it going on 
 With JD on the track how can I go wrong? 
 (JD) 
 Shut it all the way down 
 (You know me) 
 Ain't no question 
 I'mma do what I do what I does every trip mama 
 Big pimp 
 (You know me) 
 All I do is find 'em, love 'em and flee 
 It's like that 
 Big cat and I'm nice 
 (You know me) 
 Don't believe, please 
 Step, step, step up 
 And I'm bad like Mike 
 (You know me) 
 'Bout to watch small change, all change
