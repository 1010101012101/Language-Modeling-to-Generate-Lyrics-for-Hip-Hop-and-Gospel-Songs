 My apearance is headcok, throwbak, air force, no sox, 
 Braided up, T- Shirt, jeans, jordans, and a barba watch, 
 Lock man, every color bands, I mean I switch 
 Everytime da wind blow, 
 When I ain't puttin' it down, playin' around, you can 
 Catch me in dat tecno, 
 Its mandatory dat I roc 2 chains, big only way 
 I do thangs, 
 Kid wit so much game, bad stay outta my range, 
 'Cause I can make a mountain move, if I wanted too, 
 But I really wanna move u, only roc it if its new, 
 Only top it if its true, so stop ur nonsense, 
 Healthy bag, colored ful rags, jipos wit a whole 
 Lot of sag,
