 Sometimes when I'm wit my chick on the low Ima flirt 
 And when she's wit her man lookin' at me damn right Ima flirt 
 So homie don't bring your girl to me to meet cause Ima flirt

 Man that's just the way it goes 
 I pull up in the Phantom 
 All the ladies think handsome 
 Jewelry shining, I stay stuntin 
 That's why these niggas can't stand em

 And anything fine I'm bag-gin it 
 And if she got a man, I don't care

 Now-Now who do it like B-O-dub 
 Girls on me when I walk in the club 
 Game ain't tight, Ima take yo chick 
 That's it man now your girl in love 
 Witta rich nigga, fly young dude

 Don't get mad at me homie cause yo girl friend choose 
 See this is how goin' down in da 6-1-4 from the Natty up to Clevland even in Toledo

 That's right I tell the truth and the whole truth 
 When it come to hoes I be pimpin' like I supposed to, rollin' 'em like I supposed to, shinin like I supposed to 
 In the club fuckin' wit honeys like I supposed to 
 I don't understand when a nigga bring his girl friend to da CLUB 
 Creppin all ova the floor wit his girlfriend in da CLUB 
 And wonder why all these playas tryna holla at her 
 Just soon as she go to the bathroom nigga Ima holla at her 
 A dog on the prawl when I'm walkin' through the mall 
 If I could man I would probably flirt wit all of y'all 
 Yeah- yeah homie you say she yo girlfriend 
 But when I step up to her, Ima be like tarzan 
 Believe me maine this is how dem playas do it in the CHI 
 In plus we got them playette foolers in the CHI 
 Now the moral of story is cuff yo bitch 
 I'm black, handsome, I sing, 'cause I'm rich and Ima flirt 
 Soon as I see her walk up in the club Ima flirt 
 Winkin eyes at me when I roll up on dem dubs Ima flirt 
 Sometimes when I'm wit my chick on the low Ima flirt 
 And when she's wit her man lookin' at me damn right Ima flirt 
 So homie don't bring your girl to me to meet cause Ima flirt 
 And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cause Ima flirt 
 Please believe it unless your game is tight and you trust herrrrr 
 Then don't bring her round me cause Ima flirt
