It's Lil Bow Wow talkin' man, you know what I'm sayin' 
 Man Bow Wow, you know you ain't nothin' 
 Without the ghost riders man for real 
 I been in the club long before you been goin' 
 In the club, you know what I'm sayin' 
 I was walkin' in the club with JD 
 At ten years old, you know what I'm sayin' 
 Sittin' on couches, man I been doin' this 
 What you talkin' 'bout, you a new jack 
 Hold up jow wow, Bow Wow, Mr twenty one 
 Did five movies and none of 'em amount to my one 
 Like Mike did it right, Lil Bow's pay day 
 And by the way, homie you ain't nothin' without JD 
 And all the fans with me, they say that I was better 
 And you far from a flirt, how you messin' with Ciara 
 Then you cut your hair off, that's when you fell off 
 Man say your album go to platinum, that's when you cooled off 
 Disrespectin' the Bow Wow legacy 
 You got the nerve on this song to say you better than me 
 Man I rep Columbus, you rep the A Town 
 I got more street cred, I ran with the Dog Pound 
 Anythin' you can do, I can do better 
 Man we go out with the old 
 Homie you can't deny, I'm sayin' 
 Anythin' you can do, I can do better 
 Ain't talkin' 'bout nothin', the whole world agree 
 You can't do it like me, you can't do it like me 
 You can't do it like me, you can't do it like me 
 You can't do it like me, you can't do it like me 
 You can try all day but you can't do it like me 
 It's time to put the kids to bed, the endin' of an era 
 The playtime is over, I'm older but I'm better 
 I'm bigger and better, more swagger, you mad 'cause 
 You met Ciara first homie, but you couldn't bag her 
 You said you were a dog, but see you was just a puppy 
 You say you gettin' paid but you can't spend none your money 
 Ha, that's funny, I'm in the back of that 'bach 
 And you know I got nobody writin' my raps 
 So fall back little kid, you ain't Fresh Azimiz 
 I'm in my bachelor pad, you up in your mamas crib 
 Matter of fact, how you pop up after all of these years 
 I know Jermaine ain't here, so here man, he put you up to this? 
 Anythin' you can do, I can do better 
 Man we go out with the old 
 Homie you can't deny, I'm sayin' 
 Anythin' you can do, I can do better 
 Ain't talkin' 'bout nothin', the whole world agree 
 You can't do it like me, you can't do it like me 
 You can't do it like me, you can't do it like me 
 You can't do it like me, you can't do it like me 
 You can try all day but you can't do it like me 
 Now first you rappin' like TIP then you rappin' like Wayne 
 Get your own little style, homie, stay in your lane 
 You see me switchin four lanes, paint drippin' like rain 
 I ain't tippin', I ain't Wayne, don't trip you know the name 
 Still So So Def, Mickey Mouse around my neck 
 Cryin' out on television, how you don't get no respect 
 I rock a Dog Paw Chain reppin' L B W Gang 
 I ain't never shed a tear, I got no fear, I feel no pain 
 Need to hop up on your cash quick rats to the action 
 First time out I went three times platinum 
 I'm talkin' one million, two million, three million, four 
 That's four years on the runway on a major CD tour 
 Mr 106 and Park, yep my money keep stackin' 
 Ain't nobody know who you is if that had never happened 
 I'm the B O W W O W see what it is, never mind what it was 
 Roll up in the game, sold up and it's all grown up, Lil' Bow we won 
 Anythin' you can do, I can do better 
 Man we go out with the old 
 Homie you can't deny, I'm sayin' 
 Anythin' you can do, I can do better 
 Ain't talkin' 'bout nothin', the whole world agree 
 You can't do it like me, you can't do it like me 
 You can't do it like me, you can't do it like me 
 You can't do it like me, you can't do it like me 
 You can try all day but you can't do it like me
