Mustard on the beat ho 
 We in the club shit's packed 
 If it ain't Roset then we send that shit back 
 Roll it up, we smoke back to back 
 Don't act up in here homie you don't want that - ah 
 This the song for the real niggas 
 Ay this the song for the real niggas 
 Ay this the song for the real niggas 
 Ay what it do, where you from, do your thang ah 
 Hermez belt cost $650 
 If your girl look then your girl leave with me 
 Niggas lookin', but they don't want no issues 
 'Cause for the right price we can make your homies miss you 
 Now I'm ballin', ballin' like a muh fucka 
 P-I-M-P and you just a hand cuffa 
 Ferrari, drop top, rap - rap game got it in a head lock 
 I keep 7 grams in a blunt 
 Keep another shorty on the side just in case she front 
 Keep my shades on, swagger all right 
 Bitches be f*uckin' I ain't got all night 
 What it do 
 We in the club shit's packed 
 If it ain't Roset then we sent that shit back 
 Roll it up, we smoke back to back 
 Don't act up in here homie you don't want that - ah 
 This the song for the real niggas 
 Ay this the song for the real niggas 
 Ay this the song for the real niggas 
 Ay what it do, where you from, do your thang ah 
 Where my bad bitches, where they at 
 Get behind that ass quarterback snap 
 We in the club and my niggas don't know how to act 
 White tees, Levi's and a snap back 
 Niggas hatin' in the club, better stop that 
 So much cash you'd a think a nigga sold crack 
 Milli on my wrist got your girl on my dick 
 Young Money Cash Money nigga we the shit 
 Tell, tell the DJ bring it back one time 
 'Cause the crowd go crazy when they hear the bassline 
 They gon' bump it on the block, bang it in the street 
 Hey you know it's a hit as long as Mustard's on the beat 
 Now where we at 
 We in the club shit's packed 
 If it ain't Roset then we sent that shit back 
 Roll it up, we smoke back to back 
 Don't act up in here homie you don't want that - ah 
 This the song for the real niggas 
 Ay this the song for the real niggas 
 Ay this the song for the real niggas 
 Ay what it do, where you from, do your thang ah 
 You a lion, you a lion, ain't nobody fuckin' witchu you a lion 
 You a lion, you a lion, ain't nobody fuckin' witchu you a lion 
 Where my bad bitches, where they at 
 Get behind that ass quarterback snap 
 Where my bad bitches, where they at 
 Get behind that ass quarterback snap 
 We in the club shit's packed 
 If it ain't Roset then we sent that shit back 
 Roll it up, we smoke back to back 
 Don't act up in here homie you don't want that - ah 
 This the song for the real niggas

 Ay what it do, where you from, do your thang ah
