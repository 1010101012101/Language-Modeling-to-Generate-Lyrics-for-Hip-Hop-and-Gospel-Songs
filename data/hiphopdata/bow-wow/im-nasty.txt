 1st Verse 
 I got her body cimmling when I'm licking it 
 Love it when I'm sticking it 
 She like to do it with the lights off 
 Don't I get you wet while I'm kissing your neck? 
 No time for games 
 Gone head girl take your clothes off 
 Beat it from the back 
 While I'm gipping your waist 
 Pulling on your hair 
 Tell me girl, How you like it? 
 And when I put it in your mouth 
 Swollow it hole 
 You like cake right? 
 Well taste my iceing

 For everybody can see 
 If that's the kind of freaky shit you into 
 And the track so sexy 
 You got me feeling horny I can fuck you to this instrumental

 And she don't mind me with other chicks long as I give her the dick

 Give head like a porn star 
 And she make my thing solute like a soldier 
 Give it to me now
