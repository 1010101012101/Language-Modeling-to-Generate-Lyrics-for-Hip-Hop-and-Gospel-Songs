Uh Uh 
 Yup 
 Uh Uh 
 Bow Weezy 
 Look 
 Call me Chris Tucker (Why?) 
 Because my money talk 
 And you can tell I'm rich bitch 
 By the way I walk 
 And I get bucks 
 Like Milwaukee do 
 And L.B.W. GANG 
 Yeah that be the crew 
 My closet be looking like footlocker 
 Louie Vuitton shopper Bentley copper 
 Now who is hotter than me? 
 Me being I 
 All the ladies tell touch it like I'm Busta Rhymes 
 I'm in Miami now South Beach white beat 
 Lambo top down 
 You know how I be 
 You say you balling 
 But I ball way harder 
 Black card spending 
 When I down in ball harbor 
 We buy the whole mall up 
 You ask why I'm doing it 
 'Cause I can afford it 
 (What kind of stupid question is that?) 
 The chain on my neck cost more then your salary 
 You lame niggas ??? me 
 Your green is like after me 
 Gucci shades is what cover my eyes 
 And ya boy stay fly 
 Like 365 whip me down 
 Fresh tee and some brand new J's whip me down 
 I'm getting mo money like Damon Wayans 
 And I'm bad like Cool J 
 I got a bad little Houston chick 
 Thick like Beyonce 
 And she my down ass 
 With a round ass 
 And she does anything that the boy ask 
 Sold out shows 
 Everywhere I go 
 Just to hear the young boy from the O-H flow 
 100 G's per show 
 If I'm selling out anywhere I go 
 Now follow 
 My lead 
 All y'all young new rappers 
 And take notes 
 Like Rakim I ain't no joke 
 I'm bond to smoke any mic I touch 
 Rock a show 30 thousand plus 
 I make them put they're hands up 
 Bow is what's up 
 I'm in demand 
 I'm the prince of the rap game 
 Nigga I'm the man
