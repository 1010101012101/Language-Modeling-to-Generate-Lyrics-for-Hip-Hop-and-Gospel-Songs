Ooh, oh, oh, yeah 
 Why you got to make this hard? 
 All the time so difficult 
 When I'm just trying to get you notice me 
 Since I can't hold you accountable 
 For the feelings that I feel 
 I'll hold you responsible 
 'Cause I know that you can see 
 How many times? 
 I've got to say it 
 How many times? 
 The DJ gotta play it 
 How many letters would it take? 
 To make you understand 
 How many times? 
 I have to reason 
 Baby so you'll know that I need ya 
 All that I say 
 How many times? 
 Baby how can I make you realize? 
 Requested songs on the love line 
 Dedicate 'em all to you 
 I know that your just tired of me by now 
 Since I can't hold you accountable 
 For the feelings that I feel 
 I'll hold you responsible 
 'Cause I know that you can see, baby 
 How many times? 
 I've got to say it 
 How many times? 
 The DJ gotta play it 
 How many letters would it take? 
 To make you understand 
 How many times? 
 I have to reason 
 Baby so you'll know that I need ya 
 All that I say 
 How many times? 
 Baby how can I make you realize? 
 Baby can't you see I love you 
 Everyday I try to show you, oh yeah, oh 
 Baby don't you walk away from me 
 Cause love could be everything 
 All of me, all love has to bring 
 How many times? 
 I've got to say it 
 How many times? 
 The DJ gotta play it 
 How many letters would it take? 
 To make you understand 
 How many times? 
 I have to reason 
 Baby so you'll know that I need ya 
 All that I say 
 How many times? 
 Baby how can I make you realize?
