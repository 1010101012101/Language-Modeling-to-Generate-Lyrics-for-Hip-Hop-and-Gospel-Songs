 Every night I'm in the streets & I'm G'd Up 
 5th album & I'm still bangin' out your speakers 
 So so def nigga can't nobody see us 
 You know I keep it fresh when it comes to the fashion 
 At age 10 is when my mama heard the passion 
 I gotta stay stuntin' & I gotta keep flashin' 
 7 figure checks is the only thing I'm cashin' I'm stashin' 
 Everything I get on it look tight 
 Ain't nothin' like a hump when it jump & it shook right shook right 
 Ladies on a homey like I'm denzel 
 Shirt off big chain rockin' like I'm LL 
 Since 12 I done had a mill sittin' in my garage. 
 The brazilian? Girls comin' givin' me a massage 
 Before I was, people was treatin' me like a big star 
 It's a test if you wanna be in my entourage.

 Comin' wit the heat that keep me hotter than the summer 
 Call it what you want I'm the king of Coloumbus & if you wanna act up D got the dumper how you ridin'? 
 Round here I'm ridin' 30's on a Hummer Tag on the back of it say 'boy wonder' 4 15's big soundin' like thunder 
 The baddest girl up in here I better get her number When I was younger mama said I was a dreamer 
 Moved to Atlana stayed wit JD & Tina Never Ever thought I be sellin' out arenas 
 Drivin' everything from a Phantom to a Beemer Baby you should hear what I'm sayin' 
 I'm the real deal that nigga that you wit he a snack 
 I'm a full meal I see you got it in the back like Jessica Bill 
 But your talkin' baby all I wanna know if it's real Now let me see it.

 Only way wit B is like when you fly first class 
 Everything free much different then them dirt bags I'm ya entertainer keep you focused like the circus God 
 Put me here to get it poppin' that's my purpose 
 Niggas hatin' on me 'cause they gettin' over powered 
 See I make it storm & them niggas make it shower 20 minutes all they got I last for hours 
 So when I come around he outta business like toward 
 Baby it ain't trickin' if you got it that's the motto 
 Hit makers ballin' like we just hit the lotto 
 Front & back yard filled wit every kind of auto 
 Take a pick & you can bring it back tomorrow now get it 
 Let me see it.
