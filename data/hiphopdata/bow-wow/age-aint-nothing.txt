Uuuu Hello mama 
 How you're doin'? 
 How would you lookin' for a man 
 To be the one that you're persuin' 
 Girl you're rollin' with a big dog 
 Ain't no pretending you should take a low off 
 Fit me in your agenda 
 Ain't by the way you're looking 
 And I know you like that shorty 
 From the look on your face 
 You don't get out much early 
 This is something she ain't have 
 Hit'em up while we're popping text 
 Buy some shit out of the mall 
 Dad is busing through the bag 
 Love it when I chill with a pussy 
 I keep it real with her 
 Act like in the ... 
 Sometimes I sell the deal with her 
 Attitude of a Diva man 
 Hot just like a fever man 
 Said I own enough 
 Tell that to the other ... 
 She said Boy I know you're cute 
 But I gotta let you know 
 I'm old enough to be your mama 
 I laught at it and I told her 
 I ain't trippin' on that Baby 
 I ain't nothing like this other lames 
 You see the watch 
 You see the chain 
 Let me open up your mouth 
 Let me put you up on things 
 So baby girl quit fronting 
 Stop playing age ain't nothing but a number 
 Tell me where you wanna go 
 I could take you many places 
 Money come on all ... big faces small faces 
 Let her meet my mama mate 
 She ain't with a drama make 
 Put you in designer sheet 
 Yeah I'm talking fine things 
 You know I'm grown 
 You can with all that 
 I ain't old enough 
 You know I got the ... 
 Old guys they can't keep it up 
 Get my credit ... 
 So we can go buy anything you want 
 Whenever you just say 
 Take me baby I'm your ... 
 And I act twice my age 
 And I'm far from insecure 
 She shops up from catalogues 
 Loui V Christian Dior 
 Act up to a diva man 
 Hot just like a fever man 
 Sain' I ain't old enough 
 Tell that to the other lames 
 She said Boy I know you're cute 
 But I gotta let you know 
 I'm old enough to be your mama 
 I laught at it and I told her

 I ain't nothing like this other lames 
 You see the watch 
 You see the chain 
 Let me open up your mouth 
 Let me put you up on things 
 So baby girl quit fronting 
 Stop playing age ain't nothing but a number
