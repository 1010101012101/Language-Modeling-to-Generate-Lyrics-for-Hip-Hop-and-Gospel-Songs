I swear to God, boy my girl love this song 
 It has that affect joe

 Here we go 
 Hey lil mama 
 Keep doin' you 
 And fuck these otha hoes dey got nothin' on you 
 Hey these otha niqqas can't do what I do 
 Here she give me head till her face turn blue 
 Yeah-yeah-yeah that's my girl here she go hard 
 She ain't worried by you niqqas she ain't even stuntin y'all 
 And in 5 more minutes shell be comin' out dem drawers 
 And my money 8'9 
 Da-da-damn dats tall 
 Heard you workin with yo boyfriend couldn't get it togetha 
 Why settle for malt liquor when you cud have better 
 Arguin all the time, damn I know you fed up 
 Big money poppin' tell homey get his bread up 
 And girl this bow, you talkin' to a prince 
 I let my money speak but I don't talk sense, 
 Look I only talk dollaz shawty I'm on fire 
 Three girlfriends I'm a young frankie lymon 
 She know I like to smoke 
 Yep I'm a pothead 
 She went " from a mazda to ridin' in a drop head" 
 I took her outta hooters, man she ain't gotta work 
 Ass so big, its fallen out ha miniskirt 
 Face like Halle, body like Alicia, 
 This a perfect picture call it Mona Lisa 
 All my boys like her, let her meet my mother 
 Black card bound no visa or discover 
 Stains in my sheets, this girl gets sloppy wet 
 Sweatin all over, bow loves sloppy sex 
 Shoe game proper, bad game crazy 
 Want a real niqqa, well here I go baby 
 She hotter than the sun no grant hill baby 
 Runnin' to ya love, I dash like Stacy 
 I seen alotta women but none like yo kind 
 I usually don't trick but yo ass to fine 
 Walk like a model, got hella swagga 
 Treat her like groceries, I knew I had to bag her 
 Told her like the rock, I came to lay a smack down 
 I ain't talkn laptop, she know I put my mac down 
 You baby - nothin' on you baby 
 I had fun with dis shit 
 'Cause I cud do this shit

 For the ladies 
 I dunno I'm just fuckin' off in the studios 
 Had some free time niqqa
