Thought you was the one 
 Thought it was love but I was just infatuated 
 Sorry things ain't work out out 
 I I thought you was the one 
 Took my life for granted 
 Leaving wasn't the easy way out out 
 I I thought you was the one 
 And even though girl you had your bad ways 
 U just wasn't happy with yourself self 
 I I thought you was the one 
 Baby this is for the best 
 I think I'm better off by myself self 
 Got a nigga thinking different 
 Thought you really loved me girl 
 Spent most of my time with ya 
 Introduced you to my world 
 Had you to moving to miami 
 You bout to break your lease 
 Told you you ain't have to pay for nothing 
 You can just stay with me 
 'Cause I really cared for ya 
 Told ya id be there for ya 
 Shit I even thought bout putting a ring on ya 
 I know you think about me I wonder what on your mind 
 I guess I'll never know 'cause I'm leaving you behind 
 Thought you was the one 
 Thought it was love but I was just infatuated 
 Sorry things ain't work out out 
 I I thought you was the one 
 Took my life for granted 
 Leaving wasn't the easy way out out 
 I I thought you was the one 
 And even though girl you had your bad ways 
 U just wasn't happy with yourself self 
 I I thought you was the one 
 Baby this is for the best 
 I think I'm better off by myself self 
 Man we would argue all ther time 
 Then wed do something to make it up 
 Playing a dangerous game and I'm reppin up 
 Homies think I'm stupid but I got hit by cupid 
 I know what you're doing girl so don't act like I'm stupid 
 Only want the best for you I'll put you on game 
 And those couple months you were with me I made your life change 
 And whom you ever talk to girl it ain't gonna feel the same 
 Why don't you do do I'm a do the same thing 
 Thought you was the one 
 Thought it was love but I was just infatuated 
 Sorry things ain't work out out 
 I I thought you was the one 
 Took my life for granted 
 Leaving wasn't the easy way out out 
 I I thought you was the one 
 And even though girl you had your bad ways 
 U just wasn't happy with yourself self 
 I I thought you was the one 
 Baby this is for the best 
 I think I'm better off by myself self 
 I know you want me girl girl girl 
 I know you want me girl girl girl 
 I know you need me girl girl girl 
 I know you need me girl girl girl 
 Thought you was the one 
 Thought it was love but I was just infatuated 
 Sorry things ain't work out out 
 I I thought you was the one 
 Took my life for granted 
 Leaving wasn't the easy way out out 
 I I thought you was the one 
 And even though girl you had your bad ways 
 U just wasn't happy with yourself self 
 I I thought you was the one 
 Baby this is for the best 
 I think I'm better off by myself self
