Murda Mook: 
 Y'all ain't flames to me y'all ain't the same as me 
 Y'all little deals like not even a chain to me 
 Y'all little whips like not even a train to me 
 But y'all claim to be pocket change to me 
 I cock and I aim and I see y'all runnin' like puff when he ran through my block got the hand on my glock one shot put ya man in the box with the rams in the rock if ya man want to cock 
 Rocky watch too cocky stop 
 Niggas say he hot but he prolli not 
 And niggas want to hear that shotty pop 'cause if it dump it'll make your body drop 
 Record companies exects. want to have lunch with me give me a bunch of cheese 
 'Cause they see ima fein for the cream and they know gettin' cream in my jeans like ????

 'Cause ya stupid ass really thought you was safe right 
 Silly ass should of knew he had it comin' 
 Too late when the automatic dumpin 
 Got his moms in the place with her palms on her face like god damn I knew my boy had it comin'
