 (Oh...) 
 Je y'all 
 [Lil Bow Wow](JD) 
 Yo I'm looking for girls 
 (Bow Wow) 
 Girls that can give me puppy love 
 Ya know? 
 (He, he yeah) 
 Yeah it's going down right here 
 West coast rock on 
 (Come on) 
 East coast rock on 
 (Come on) 
 Dirty South rock on 
 Yeah 
 (Come on, come on, come on) 
 All young girls beware 
 This pup's off the chains 
 I'm gritty little something here 
 Putting down pain 
 Since I was six 
 Running with the pound 
 It's been going down 
 I'm city to city, town to town 
 They running up screaming my name 
 Running up grabbing my chain 
 Running up tryna get in the game 
 I'm like ma don't get it twisted 
 If we kick it get your bark on 
 Hope to God you see me again, when I'm grown 
 Type of playa but it ain't 
 It just sounds like that 
 'Cause I'm just too young to get down like that 
 (I agree) 
 Hit the movies, hit the mall 
 Then come out with big bags 
 Next day do lunch then head Six Flags 
 But it don't mean nothing 
 We're just having some fun 
 Even though I may have told you on the ride 
 You're the on 
 I'm sorry little shorty 
 I just gotta take that back 
 'Cause I'm just too young to get down like that 
 So... 
 [Lil Bow Wow](Jagged Edge) 
 (You can't hear me) 
 Not a word that I be saying 
 (Its plain to see)
