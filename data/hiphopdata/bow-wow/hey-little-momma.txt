 (Hey lil momma) 
 Listen baby, I'm tired of of switching labels, let's say we 
 Consider dating, continue communicating. 
 No cahsing, no wasting yo time, the pleasures mine. 
 I'mma show how to shine, just sit back and recline. 
 'Cause the ride on stilts, my bank going swole, 
 I'm wearing Rose Gold at 16 years old. 
 But right now that don't matter. 
 I honestly rather be dicussing or to fussing how we gon get together. 
 And whether you knew it or not, I was digging yo style, loving yo smile.
