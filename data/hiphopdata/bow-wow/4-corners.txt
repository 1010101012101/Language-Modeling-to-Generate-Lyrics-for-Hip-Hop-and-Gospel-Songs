 Jermaine dupri: 
 Question, what y'all know about swangers on a slab? 
 30's on a hummer with the butterfly doors, lucky charm teeth lack on dem d's, chevy's sittin' high 
 Iced out everything, stacks on deck no bank. 
 What y'all know about 5 of the hottest young niggas in the game? 
 Bow wow, $hort dawg, scrappy, tha boy lil' wayne, the homey pimp c 
 We got a little story to tell y'all about where we come from. 
 (Verse 1: bow wow) 
 I come from where a chevy wit a trunk full of bump is all that's wanted 
 In a year it don't matter long as you throw some throw some d's on it mouth cost more than your house 
 House on 10 acres 
 In the inside so fly niggas call me jim baker from ohio to Texas 
 We so infectious atl to stl is gon' to be hard to catch us 
 I'm talkin' 'about niggas poppin' pills, pills, sippin' on bar, bar, drinkin' crunk livin' like it's no tomorrow 
 See out of towners can't understand 'cause I cut all my words shawt poppin' tags is mandatory 
 Saturday at the mall hoods ain't hoods they cardboards and zones guns car choppers 
 And when it's on it's on see the kids can't live without it and it ain't nothin' you can do about it 
 Learn how to bounce and get out it hear me out see the kids can't live without and it 
 Ain't nothin' you can do 'about it learn how to bounce and get out it and now answer me this. 
 (Chorus: pimp c) 
 Now what y'all know about them country boys comin' down in candy toys playin' hard talkin' noise?

 (Verse 2: too $hort) 
 The boy country like overalls you know that dawg catch me in a slab the same color as bowlin' balls 
 Crusin' up the avenue I'm probably gon' give you hoe on cop 
 'Cause I ball hard & I'm stuntin' just like it's no tomorrow 
 So yesterday I swear I spent about 50 g's on a wrist watch that shine brighter then the christmas tree 
 If you was gettin' cheese you would probably spend too so don't hate 'em 'cause I blow paper like the wind do 
 And hop out clean so watch your queen I'm my biggest baller in houston homey not yao ming 
 I mean I'm gettin' money man so my pockets hell a chubby & I be sippin' drank that's purple like the teletubbies 
 So when it comes to the women dawg I can tell they love me they put they panties in a envelope and mail 'em to me, damn. 
 Now how's that for some fan mail? 
 But me and bow gotta question know the answer raise your hand yell. 
 (Chorus: pimp c)

 (Verse 3: lil' scrappy) 
 Yeah they call me fisher price 'cause all I do is play nice & I hang around the gang of gorillas that love to fight 
 I'm the ice man 
 I'm far away from the sun 
 But I'm still hot like a bullet pushin' about a gun 
 My charger look like a muscle liftin' a ton you can pickin' on me 
 Then you picked the right one that's right you pass another drink & I'm sippin' another one 
 You trust me up I'm blunin' I'm blowin' myself a bun 
 Got a froot loop coup lookin' like orange juice when them hoes see the truth 
 They don't be knowin' what to do 
 Yeah I'm scrap, scrap, the youngest young nigga in the nation 
 Young nigga quit hatin' on the money that I'm makin' I'm just country nigga. 
 (Chorus: pimp c)

 (Verse 4: lil' wayne) 
 Look they call me wayne that is our cheporone 
 So far ahead of the race I don't know which lap I'm on, damn 
 Little homo young louisiana hit you with the 3 5 7 like MC hammer and money talks so that's my grammar 
 If you ain't about money you can step like a gambler. 
 Am I the illest doin' this? 
 Hell yeah I am fresher then the prince of bel air (me too) & o.g. kush is what you smell 
 Here smokin' the biggest blunt's don't worry I brought a spare they say I'm at the top but I'm almost there 
 And when I get I will sit don't worry I brought a chair 
 I'll put ice all over the altermare but yay watch 
 Face no time is hard to tell 
 And I will do whatever tha carter shell 
 So hot goin' out wit me is like goin' to hell. 
 (Chorus: pimp c)
