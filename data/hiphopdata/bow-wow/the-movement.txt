Intro: Pharrell 
 (O lawd) 
 Bow Wow: 
 Young and confused wit nothin' to lose 
 But sumthin to prove, my hunger my views 
 I use 'em as tools to refuse for the sake of rebellin 
 Breakin tha rules and yellin', 
 Tellin' 'em to come and walk in my shoes, come and try it 
 Be defiant, we put the heart of a lion 
 See if you like it, you livin' yo life culturally bias 
 'Cause tha ghettos got a bad rep and we gotta bad rap 
 So we get a half step in da door 
 Get the last laugh (ha) 
 No future, no past We live for the right now 
 Want us to pipe down But this is wut life sounds like 
 When the thugs cry (and I) seen love die 
 (And I) seen that hates born and born as it takes off form 
 As we take on the world is placed on our shoulders 
 But socially they neva know wassup 
 They approach us wit they reconcieved notions 
 At least that's wut the homies told me 
 The celebrations the movement 
 Man we young and confused and to ambitious to lose it 
 Just see we lovin' life 
 Since we was just critics they say that we'd be go gettaz 
 The celebrations the movement 
 Man we young and confused and to ambitious to lose it

 Like the war thing 
 I don't know what y'all seen 
 But my generation is gettin' caught 
 In the cross-beams uh 
 No Preparation, medication, and vaccines uh 
 No reperation for the children who ask things but 
 Ain't no answers they just say pull ya pants up 
 They don't understand us and 
 Still reprimand us, demand us 
 To live like this and that and that 'n' dis 
 And it has us pissed and after dis? 
 Ill probably be banned 
 But I gotta take a stand 
 'Cause you seen wut happened wit Eminem 
 Ignored Stan, he just lost it 
 Be cautious, see we all targets 
 My thoughts is paretic 
 I feel so asthmatic 
 Outta breath, sick of talkin' 
 So we takin' action against the democracy 
 Full of hip-hopcracy 
 I know its more to me 
 Then my hip hop eyes they see 
 That's wut da homie said to me 
 The celebrations the movement 
 Man we young and confused and to ambitious to lose it 
 Just see we lovin' life 
 Since we was just critics they say that we'd be go gettaz

 Pharrell and Bow Wow: 
 In da world there's so much goin' on 
 Could leave ya parinoid 
 Like that's just poppin' noise 
 Please don't just think its project boys 
 Whether ya urban night or ya suburban night 
 It doesn't matta, wut matters is if ya swervin right 
 Don't get it twisted alot happens in suburban lives 
 'Cause dead is dead whether in ya room, 
 Or a curb at night 
 But the Lord is shinin on ya 
 He said in there to calm ya 
 He said I'll be back 
 The words like Sarah Conners 
 She said we sleepin' on ya 
 Wake up and leanin on ya 
 Terminated, we playin' terminated 
 By ya honor 
 Pharrell (Bow Wow): 
 We don't wanna die (nah) 
 We just wanna fly 
 (Eva felt like you just wanna get away man? 
 It's the movement, I don't think y'all heard me man... 
 It's the movement)
