(Bow Wow) 
 L.B.W. 
 Ay look 
 Lamborghini Moss hoe I'm far from as Lame 
 Hey critics hating on you Bow 
 Say you rapping like Wayne 
 I give a damn what a hater think 
 Nigga I'm paid 
 Plus the ladies love a nigga 
 You can call me Cool J 
 I'm the Prince of the O-Town 6.1.4. 
 I say stunting every where I go 
 Top down on the Macy 
 Listening to B.I. 
 And yeah y'all nigga's doin' it 
 But homie not like this guy 
 Hated by many 
 Though I got plenty 
 And all the hoes tell me it's whatever like Remy 
 Bow ain't got no bread 
 You nigga's talking silly 
 And plus I'm way flyer 
 You would think I play for Philly 
 Well these rappers going broke 
 My accounts is full of Millie's 
 And like New York's traffic the boy gets busy 
 In the club on Patron 
 Till my head gets dizzy 
 Lenox mall black card 
 So a nigga stay (Spelling) 
 Yup 
 Plus the boy been getting paper since way back 
 Who you know who 21 with a driver and a Maybach? 
 So watch out when that boy switch lanes 
 If the masseuse ain't on board 
 You better switch up your plane 
 I'm on a whole another level 
 A.P. diamond (Spelling) 
 Took back the white diamonds 
 I got all yellow 
 It's nuggets in the chain 
 But don't call me Carmelo 
 And I don done it all don done it all like LO 
 My Oregon chick got an ass like jello 
 Foxx took her out but she belong to me though 
 Which you know about getting Louie blowin' 10 stacks? 
 Hitting Tootsie throwing money 
 I'd don't know how to act 
 Nas told me Bow Wow don't worry bout these nigga's 
 Keep on doing you 
 Then watch yo account get bigger 
 Got your house around my neck 
 Got your car around my waist 
 If you hating that you broke 
 Just admit that I'm the shit 
 Bitch
