Uh huh, yeah yeah, bow wow, mario, y'all ready 
 I'll move on 
 Living the life, knowing I don't like what's on the table, looking at my life doing what's right because I'm able 
 Learnin' lessons, while protected, feeling grate oh 
 I'll move on 
 Living the life, knowing I don't like what's on the table 
 Looking at my life, doing what's right because I'm able 
 There's no turning back, see yestardays gone (yeah, yeah, 
 Yeah yeah yeah) I'll move on 
 Life goes on, as I roll on 
 I can only be a child for so long 
 Y'all wanna see my child hood prolong 
 But this time bow wow say so long 
 And I step to a new day, 
 New age, and a new page 
 In the book of life but it's lookin' like 
 Y'all ain't ready for the new phase 
 Then I'ma get more mature 
 Make mistakes, but hey 
 Everybody did that before 
 Ever feel like you've been traped before 
 Wish you could open up a magic door 
 Step throught it, just do it 
 The way that you feel it but cha'll confuse it 
 Y'all wanna show me, keep me secluded 
 But this is life I'm bound to go throught it 
 It's a process y'all gotta dijest 
 Let the boy grow up, wanna go out 
 Have a little fun, if it get a lil' wild, 
 Then so what 
 Cause an ounce of experience 
 Is more than a pint of advice 
 I hope y'all hearing this, 'cause I'm serious 
 And it's like, I'm so curious about life 
 I'm movin' on 
 I'll move on 
 Living the life, knowing I don't like what's on the table, looking at my life doing what's right because I'm able 
 Learnin' lessons, while protected, feeling grate oh 
 I'll move on 
 Living the life, knowing I don't like what's on the table 
 Looking at my life, doing what's right because I'm able 
 There's no turning back, see yestardays gone (yeah, yeah, 
 Yeah yeah yeah) I'll move on 
 I bet you think you know what you think you know 
 But I'm different than any one you've eva seen before 
 So don't compare me to other thirteen year olds 
 You seen lookin' cute comin' on the scene to blow 
 First impression of a young adolescent 
 A grown up mind that flow so impressive 
 Grew up so fast in this profession 
 A flash of concerts and late night sessions 
 So much dough, he don't know it's a blessin' 
 The way he brag, he won't last one second 
 But au contraire don't stop and stare 
 If I sell my jewelry and cut my hair 
 Still be here after y'all 
 Standin' tall, like I ain't had a chance to ball 
 So when you doubt me I'll just laugh at cha'll 
 Shad Moss, fall in love, ain't in da plans at all 
 But ain't no tellin' 
 When there's no more sellin' another record end up 
 Wit a pen label ends up a record but nah 
 Still got actin'& basketball 
 So if you ain't checkin' for me 
 I ain't checkin' for y'all 
 So 
 Let this be a lesson to y'all 
 When a rap acteace 
 Play professional ball 
 No matter who you get at rights 
 Or who you listening to 
 You get one life can't nobody live it but you 
 I'll move on 
 Living the life, knowing I don't like what's on the table, looking at my life doing what's right because I'm able 
 Learnin' lessons, while protected, feeling grate oh 
 I'll move on 
 Living the life, knowing I don't like what's on the table 
 Looking at my life, doing what's right because I'm able 
 There's no turning back, see yestardays gone (yeah, yeah, 
 Yeah yeah yeah) I'll move on 
 Movin on yeah 
 Movin on, movin on
