Hope this don't offend anybody 
 But I gotta get something off my chest 
 How the hell you think I'm ?posed to feel? 
 I had a peace of mind before I had this record deal 
 Too much stress when is shit gon ever change? 
 And they don't wanna see you winning so they'd rather hate 
 And real G's try to keep a low profile 
 Niggas on youtube snitching on theyselves now 
 Gave my nigga Bart 20 months 
 Tell 'em imma hold his daughter down he ain't got nothing to worry bout 
 While he locked up na 
 Police messing up I'm damned they ready to fly 
 Open myself up right and tear this city up 
 That shit was damn wrong 
 To the police who did it I hope you burn in hell with gasoline drawers on 
 Turning 22 some don't make it this far 
 Yep I'm blessed so for that I gotta thank God 
 When Barack get in I hope my people get jobs 
 I understand your pain 'cause right now times is hard 
 No money for the hood but got money to build the mall 
 People tryna find a way to pay they bills tomorrow 
 And the goons ain't eating right 
 So rappers jewellery is they appetite 
 Yeah and that's a fact some 13 year olds will lay you down for a stack like that 
 And man that's real life 
 Sick to my stomach, yeah that's what I feel like 
 Because I toss and turn in my sleep 
 Woke up and heard another young?un gunned by police 
 Ain't this some shit? 
 When is this ever gon stop? 
 Crooked government still got crooked cops (ya heard me)
