Yeah 
 I'm the hottest thing to hit the block 
 Since the CL5 
 From CO to ATL I keeps it locked 
 Like a fresh pair of 23's, once seen 
 Can't get enough of me, my team 
 Getting paper from all angles 
 Which means everybody got a triangle 
 Ya heard me? 
 I'm the truth like beans 
 And when it comes to teens in this rap thing 
 You looking at the mob 
 Not to mention that I'm hot 
 Yeah you already know 
 And I shuts down the block everywhere that I go 
 Call me the Tiger Woods of this 
 Yeah I'm gettin' explosive 
 I come with the dopest flow at 13 like whoa 
 1 - Little girls think that I'm deliscious 
 Grown folks say I'm just too viscious 
 But they don't understand 
 It's just the dog in me 
 And that's just the way I am 
 Mess with me you get bit 
 In 2k I ain't having it 
 What y'all don't understand? 
 It's just the dog in me 
 And that's just the way I am 
 Lil man with the big checks 
 Lil man that's got big girls 
 Wanting to teach me about sex
