Haha let's go 
 Yeah uh uh uh yeah 
 I know y'all can hear that 
 Just need to holla at y'all for a minute y'know 
 Let y'all know that I'm still here 
 And I'm gon always be here 
 Makin' these hits after hit 
 It ain't gon stop 
 I can't lose 
 I been in this game for too long 
 Y'all, I ain't gonna take mine 
 I'm sayin' 
 I can't lose 
 I'm the very best 
 And I'm gon be the very best for a long time and 
 I can't lose 
 Y'all cats just waggin along my tail 
 Y'all can't carry my bone 
 I'm sayin' 
 I can't lose 
 I'm the top dawg of them all 
 And you know I'm takin' it home 
 Sony plays me when I'm up in the station 
 All of a sudden they got me up in hot rotation 
 As soon as I see 'em yeah I act like I they lil brother 
 But I can't get no sauce on the XXL cover 
 That's why I call myself the man 
 Name me one rap cat who sold out Madison Square (Bow Wow) 
 But Janet Michael 
 And a couple of rock acts who don't know crap about rap 
 All these lil rap cats is here because of me 
 All them bubblegum raps is about to see 
 Swing on tour 
 Came up outta the ceiling 
 Teasin these girls eyes 
 But they was feelin' over this lil rap villain 
 I can't lose 
 Don't matter who I'm facin 
 The number one 
 Under 21 artist in this nation 
 The rhyme writer 
 All the young girls like him 
 Fellas wanna be like him 
 I got 'em like Pied Piper 
 Follow my paw print 
 Whatever y'all print in the magazines is nonsense 
 Stop all this 
 Yakkety yakkin 
 The fact that nobody rappin' 
 Can stack 'em up to the ceiling 
 Like 30,000 a building now 
 You got Jigga, Ja, Nelly, Nas, Eminem, and Kiss 
 I'm representin for all the kids now 
 Say that I'm braggin 
 But no other rapper in my age bracket 
 Is makin' it happen the way that I made it happen 
 You think it's easy don't ya 
 Wanna be Weezy don't ya 
 I'm a performer homie 
 You just take it easy won't ya 
 From Nickelodeon shows to BET 
 I'm approachin the podium 
 Vouchers votin for me 
 'Cause 
 I keep it real wit 'em 
 Everytime I deal wit 'em 
 They bounced wit me from the start 
 And I'm still wit 'em 
 I got the keys to cities I never heard of 
 And every inner city kid got me turned up 
 Wit the CD on replay 
 So the he say she say don't affect me 
 No way 
 I go on day to day 
 And continue to make money 
 Make music make movies 
 You can never take this from me 
 Aww, there you have it 
 Ladies and Gentlemen 
 Just had to talk to y'all for a minute y'know 
 Spit at the fans 
 Spit at the people 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 Just let them know what's goin' on 
 But uh we gon ride it out like this though 
 If you know it 
 Sing it wit me 
 I can't lose
