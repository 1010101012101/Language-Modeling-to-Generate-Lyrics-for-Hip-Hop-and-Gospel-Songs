See this rite here 
 Might be the realest shit I ever told 'em before... fa real 
 I sat down to her 
 I grabbed her hand 
 And I looked in her eyes and I told her 
 I told her, I said um 
 Damn, you make a nigga get love struck 
 Make a nigga go 
 And wanna grab an all black tux 
 Hit j.lo 
 And tell her call the wedding planner up 
 Set the date 
 I'll be there 
 Meet me at the alter honey 
 You ain't gotta worry bout 
 All them other broads boo 
 Live up at the mall boo 
 Let me black card you 
 Treat you like expired milk 
 Baby I'll spoil you 
 Forget cheating on you baby girl 
 I'm too loyal 
 Tell me where you wanna dine 
 Reservations set for 9 
 No group, all me 
 Sipping on a glass of wine 
 Winter time is fur time 
 Vacating up in aspen 
 Ex broke her heart 
 Now she can breath again like tony braxton 
 Pretty brown brown driving me wild
