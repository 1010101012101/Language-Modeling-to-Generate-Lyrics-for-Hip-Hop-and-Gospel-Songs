Bow wow: 
 Bently GT on the highway insane switchin lanes gotta bad chick givin' me brain 
 Whoever said you had skills had to be lyin' 
 Say it for the record fuck don imus 
 It's the B capitol O capitol DUB 
 TLC rappaz 'cause them niggas is scrubs (trash) 
 Look I'm with the games been missin' 
 Talk slick betta cool it now like new edition - 2x 
 I know you just wishin 
 I hear these niggas dissin 
 My jordan sneaks tied tight so I'm neva trippin' 
 I'm neva fallin' bow is what they call him 
 And you can watch espn and see that I be ballin 
 And y'all niggas can't touch us 
 Diamonds in my chain the same color as mustard 
 So don't cross me like caution tape 
 Bow don't forget the wow had to remind you lames 
 Gone 
 Can't rhyme with the money I'm paid in full 
 My doors lift up on the ride you see the bull 
 Red card no visa 
 Demands my respect like aretha 
 And ya money low like a ceasar 
 I do this son 
 And if you bet against the dog then you must be dumb 
 And they don't make them like me no more 
 I'm one of a kind 
 I'm rare like an eclipse nigga hard to find 
 Body any MC out 
 Put some money up 
 If you ain't talkin' bout matchin' a bet then what we talkin' for 
 1.5 receivin them checks 
 Hatas is mad 
 'Cause like the shoe stores them niggas get paid less 
 Can't nobody do it like Teressas son 
 Diamonds everywhere no wonder why wrist is numb 
 Success is over and now its back to business 
 Top 5 rappas homie I'm the one you should mention 
 Gone
