Throw me the ball and watch what I do with it 
 We got Bow Wow in the house 
 My man Lil' Zane, huh, Lil' Wayne 
 Sammie sang to me 
 (Sammie) 
 Strike one, got you by surprise 
 Strike two, right before your eyes 
 Pitch three, this ones to the wall 
 Ain't no fun like a game of Hardball 
 (Lil' Bow Wow) 
 When I step to the plate the outfielders get back (back) 
 'Cause they know I'm the over the wall type of dog 
 So many back to back hits they call me little Sammy Sosa 
 Bubble gum cards, and all of the posters 
 Y'all know how I roast ya when it's time to compete 
 On the field, on the court, over any hot beat or break 
 And you know it when you see your clone 
 And right now that's all I see goin' on, holla at me 
 Game time, all I think about is bringing home the trophy 
 If your team is better than mine, you really gotta show me 
 Really gotta beat me, really gotta trash talk 
 Mistreat me, to send my squad back home 
 'Cause I don't lose too much 
 Matter fact, I ain't never lost at all 
 When I'm playin' Hardball (that's right) 
 So, if you on the mound about to pitch to me 
 Understand I'm like Griffey, I keep 'em to the wall 
 (Sammie) 
 Strike one, caught you by surprise 
 Strike two, right before your eyes 
 Strike three, oh I got you out 
 Without a doubt, I got you out 
 Strike one, caught you by surprise 
 Strike two, right before your eyes 
 Pitch three, this one's to the wall 
 Ain't no fun like a game of Hardball 
 (Lil' Zane) 
 This goes out to them jocks that stay on my jock, throwin' the pop 
 Keep pithcin', I'm in the kitchen makin' radio rock 
 It's usually preferred, I be choosey with all my words 
 Throwin' eggs at them chicken heads, beggin on the curb 
 Direct from my blurb, a fast baller with a curve 
 Have her slidin' home, tellin' her friends just in the third 
 I'm sure ya done heard, who I'm doin' and what I'm doin' 
 What's false and what's true an... girl listen 
 When it comes to this game they call me Zane McGwire 
 That other kid was just a Mark so I made him retire 
 See we all got a base, and we hold our own 
 But when I, come up to bat we gonna all come home 
 And our fans cheer us on cause the know what the drill is 
 Goin', out of the fields into your automobile 
 And I hope it ain't your Range Rover that you spent your change over 
 I'm in the dugout with my tongue out playing game over 
 (Sammie) 
 Strike one, caught you by surprise 
 Strike two, right before your eyes 
 Strike three, oh I got you out 
 Without a doubt, I got you out 
 Strike one, caught you by surprise 
 Strike two, right before your eyes 
 Pitch three, this one's to the wall 
 Ain't no fun like a game of Hardball 
 (Lil' Wayne) 
 Listen, listen, listen 
 They call me Wheezy Rodriguez 
 You know I'm gettin' it hot as the bullet that killed Kennedy, y'know 
 And I keep the chrome bat swingin', swingin' that iron 
 Pitch on the block like Nolan Ryan 
 Too bad for TV, you won't see me when I'm right in the streets 
 I'm a hustler, people, my life in the streets 
 Watch the game, get your wife in the sheets 
 My watch, my chain and my teeth cost 
 That way I will never cheap talk 
 And I call mommy sweetheart, she call me sweet daddy 
 And she gladly, loves the way that daddy bat it, yeah baby 
 Wheezy Wheez a player baby, and I don't share baby 
 So if you're searching for some pussy ain't nothin' here baby 
 Catch me throwin' an eighty in the latest Bently, goin' out 
 And Wheezy never hit a foul, a hot guy 
 Don't hit pop flies, I knock it up out the park 
 And after the game's over we gon' meet up after dark 
 (Sammie) 
 Strike one, caught you by surprise 
 Strike two, right before your eyes 
 Strike three, oh I got you out 
 Without a doubt, I got you out 
 Strike one, caught you by surprise 
 Strike two, right before your eyes 
 Pitch three, this one's to the wall 
 Ain't no fun like a game of Hardball 
 Strike one, caught you by surprise 
 Strike two, right before your eyes 
 Strike three, oh I got you out 
 Without a doubt, I got you out 
 Strike one, caught you by surprise 
 Strike two, right before your eyes 
 Pitch three, this one's to the wall 
 Ain't no fun like a game of Hardball 
 Lil' Bow Wow, Lil' Zane, Lil' Wayne, Lil' Sammie 
 The Lil' Rascals, and me, y'all know my name
