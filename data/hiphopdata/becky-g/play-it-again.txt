Watch me take it up, then I break it down 
 I don't play sports, but it's a touchdown 
 I don't blend in, I'm a black sheep 
 And even then, ha they still follow me 
 I rock three stripes, can go and check my closet 
 Never share the guap, can go and check my wallet 
 I'm a comet, out of this planet 
 Sitting on the throne and these haters can't stand it 
 Dj, play my song on the radio 
 Lift me up when I'm feeling low 
 Drop the beat and play it again 
 Play it again, yeah 
 Dj, spin it back if you're feeling me 
 The 808 track is all I need 
 Drop the beat and play it again 
 Play it again, yeah 
 Now watch me do my thing 
 Do my thing out on the stage 
 I become an animal 
 Go and put me in a cage 
 I'm a beast, I'm a beast 
 Why they let me off my leash? 
 No you can't tame me 
 In this jungle of concrete 
 I'm a creature, I ain't lying 
 Not a cheetah, I'm a lioness 
 They saying that I'm the best 
 And I ain't drop an album yet 
 I got them waiting, anticipating 
 They losing patience 
 My music is vaccination for all my loyal patients 
 Ride to the moon moon light 
 Let the boom boom play 
 Turn it up 'til you feel that base 
 Rock, never gon, gon stop 
 Say whatcha wanna say 
 We finna keep going anyway
