I won't stop till I get to the top 
 I'm so I'm so Becky from the block 
 Always had a little, but I want a lot 
 No matter where I go I know where I came from 
 Yo, first grade, Oak school elementary 
 A few blocks from the Inglewood cemetery 
 I lived through hard times, according to my memory 
 Then I learned to run like I'm reading up the dictionary 
 I still walk to the Kelso Market 
 Even though I get to walk them red carpets 
 My family lived in my grampa's garage 
 So I started working just to help out my pops 
 It all started when my grampa crossed over 
 Now one day I might be a crossover 
 Right now it's just who is that girl? 
 But one day Ima be all around the world 
 I still get grounded, always stay grounded 
 Still do chores even when I'm on tour 
 One thing's for sure, Ima always be me 
 That what's up? Becky, Becky G 
 I won't stop till I get to the top 
 I'm so I'm so Becky from the block 
 Always had a little, but I want a lot 
 No matter where I go I know where I came from 
 You what you know about the in and out lines 
 And what you know about that 4×5 drive 
 My life is changing quickly right before my eyes 
 It hits me every time that I'm on Hollywood divine 
 If you wanna date me, you gotta ask my Daddy 
 And my 30 uncles, you can meet them in an alley! 
 And one day Imma bring home a Grammy 
 But no matter what I'll be bringing home randies 
 Donuts, haller when you see me 
 I'm still the same B, even when I'm on TV 
 Still rocking Js with my diamonds and pearls 
 You can take me out the hood, but not the hood out of the girl 
 Yes I love sushi, love my calamari 
 But ain't no better chef than my very own mommy 
 If you can't catch me warming in my barrio 
 I'm with my litas praying the Rosario 
 Inglewood, Inglewood, Inglewood 
 I won't stop till I get to the top 
 I'm so I'm so Becky from the block 
 Always had a little, but I want a lot 
 No matter where I go I know where I came from 
 I won't stop till I get to the top 
 I'm so I'm so Becky from the block 
 Always had a little, but I want a lot 
 No matter where I go I know where I came from 
 I won't stop till I get to the top 
 I'm so I'm so Becky from the block 
 Always had a little, but I want a lot 
 No matter where I go I know where I came from 
 Inglewood, Callie girls for life
