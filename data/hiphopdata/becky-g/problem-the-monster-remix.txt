 The Monster Remix 
 I'm a monster, I'm a m-monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a m-monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a m-monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a m-monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a m-monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a m-monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a monster 
 I'm one of a kind, got everybody in love 
 And I don't have to try, I just do what I does 
 Don't have to tell me, I already know 
 They all want me 
 Yo, I run this, I smash it 
 Like my bass real hard, boom-bastic 
 Speed race baby, I'm a lot faster 
 Cause trouble, never listen to my master 
 New Benz all black, from Malaysia 
 Can't drive, but my mama don't care yeah 
 To the top, I'mma take it to the ceiling 
 I'm on the moon but I feel the sun beaming 
 I'm so dope like ooh la la 
 So so fly like a helicopter 
 Sup to the hood and the homies on the block 
 Doin' it big, ya you know, what's up 
 Some come and try to say I'm a problem 
 So crazy, gotta put 'em in an asylum 
 Some come and try to say I'm a problem 
 Ha, solve it 
 I'm a monster, I'm a m-monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a m-monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a m-monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a m-monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a m-monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a m-monster 
 I'm a monster, I'm a monster 
 I'm one of a kind, got everybody in love 
 And I don't have to try, I just do what I does 
 Don't have to tell me, I already know 
 They all want me 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 You got one down, I'm on 2 now 
 There's another one! I gotta few now 
 You know I'm a beast, I throw down 
 Show down, whatcha gonna do now 
 Kick rocks 'cause you're just another hater 
 New team I'm an all-star player 
 Get at me but you better get your game up 
 My steez like ooh la la

 It's my time yeah, check my watch 
 My mama say I'm a leader 
 His mama say I'm a keeper 
 That's too bad 'cause I ride solo 
 Do it one time then you want some more 
 I'm a problem, tell ya, I'm a problem 
 Yo, yo 
 Yo, yo

 I'm one of a kind, got everybody in love 
 And I don't have to try, I just do what I does 
 Don't have to tell me, I already know 
 They all want me 
 I'm one of a kind, got everybody in love 
 And I don't have to try, I just do what I does 
 Don't have to tell me, I already know 
 They all want me
