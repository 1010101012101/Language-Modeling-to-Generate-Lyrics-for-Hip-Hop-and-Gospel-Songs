It's the Shower remix 
 (Verse 1 - Tyga:) 
 Yeah I own that, new car, yeah I own that 
 Crazy color rims, they tone that 
 Stuntin' on Instagram, where your home at 
 Oh, how you don't know that, I see your bank account, let's blow that 
 Let me hide ya for a minute, wait a moment 
 Hanging up, caling right back, then I told her 
 (Verse 2 - Becky G:) 
 I don't know, it's just something about ya 
 Got me feeling like I can't be without ya 
 Anytime someone mention your name 
 I be feeling as if I'm around ya 
 Ain't no words to describe you baby 
 All I know is that you take me high 
 Can you tell that you drive me crazy? 
 'Cause I can't get you out my mind 
 (Pre-Hook - Becky G:) 
 Think of you when I'm going to bed 
 When I wake up think of you again 
 You are my homie, lover and friend 
 Exactly why 
 (Hook - Becky G:) 
 You light me up inside 
 Like the 4th of July 
 Whenever you're around 
 I always seem to smile 
 And people ask me how 
 Well you're the reason why 
 I'm dancing in the mirror and singing in the shower 
 (Post-Hook - Becky G:) 
 La La Di, La La Da, La La Da 
 Singing in the shower 
 La La Di, La La Da, La La Da 
 Singing in the shower 
 (Verse 3 - Becky G:) 
 All I want, all I need is your loving 
 Baby you make me hot like an oven 
 Since you came you know what I've discovered 
 Baby I don't need me another 
 No, no all I know (know) 
 Only you got me feeling so (so) 
 And you know that I got to have you 
 And I don't plan to let you go 
 (Pre-Hook - Becky G:) 
 Think of you when I'm going to bed 
 When I wake up think of you again 
 You are my homie, lover and friend 
 Exactly why 
 (Hook - Becky G:) 
 You light me up inside 
 Like the 4th of July 
 Whenever you're around 
 I always seem to smile 
 And people ask me how 
 Well you're the reason why 
 I'm dancing in the mirror and singing in the shower 
 (Post-Hook - Becky G:) 
 La La Di, La La Da, La La Da 
 Singing in the shower 
 La La Di, La La Da, La La Da 
 Singing in the shower 
 (Verse 4 - Tyga:) 
 Uh, a fake real though 
 Real love, so I know that it will though 
 You've been waiting in like the car 
 I'm a pick you up like a newborn 
 And dream on, it's the high life 
 I see the stars in your eyes, it's just too bright 
 Got a good grip, you wanna hold tight 
 Kinda like a flashlight 
 (Hook - Becky G:) 
 You light me up inside 
 Like the 4th of July 
 Whenever you're around 
 I always seem to smile 
 And people ask me how 
 Well you're the reason why 
 I'm dancing in the mirror and singing in the shower 
 (Outro - Becky G:) 
 La La Di, La La Da, La La Da (hey) 
 Singing in the shower 
 La La Di, La La Da, La La Da 
 You got me singing in the shower 
 La La Di, La La Da, La La Da 
 Singing in the shower 
 La La Di, La La Da, La La Da
