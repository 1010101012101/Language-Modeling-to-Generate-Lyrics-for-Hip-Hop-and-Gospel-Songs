I'm (I'm) so (so) hypnotized, open the days, mesmerized 
 I'm tryna visualize, you right now, keep me cool right now 
 I like to be optimistic, you and me, that's futuristic 
 We can fly high like a spaceship, zoom right now, to the moon right now 
 You want me all alone (Yeah, I heard that before) 
 But first I gotta know (Gotta know if you're insecure) 
 Can you take control? (Tell me baby, can you read my lips?) 
 Boy, I gotta know (I wanna know if you're built for this) 
 Built for this, built for this 
 I wanna know if you're built for this 
 I wanna know if you're built for this 
 Too fly for you, have to go 
 So cold like a popsicle 
 Row deep when we at the show 
 Guest list, Becky G plus Mexico 
 You don't know what you do to me 
 Got me acting all stupidly 
 If I'm allowed to speak truthfully 
 In a world full of lies you're the truth to me 
 You want me all alone (Yeah, I heard that before) 
 But first I gotta know (Gotta know if you're insecure) 
 Can you take control? (Tell me baby, can you read my lips?) 
 Boy, I gotta know (I wanna know if you're built for this) 
 Built for this, built for this 
 I wanna know if you're built for this 
 I wanna know if you're built for this 
 You want me all alone 
 But first I gotta know 
 Can you take control? 
 Boy, I gotta know (I wanna know if you're built for this) 
 I wanna know if you're built for this 
 I wanna know if you're built for this
