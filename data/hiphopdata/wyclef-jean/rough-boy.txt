What in the world has come over me? 
 I feel like I lost my chance in society 
 Even though I rap, I'm runnin' outta line 
 But give me a minute to catch myself, girl, I'll be feelin' fine 
 I am the one who can fade the heat 
 The one they all say just can't be beat 
 I'll shoot it to you straight and look at you in the eye 
 Just give me a minute, girl, and I'm a-tell you why 
 I'm a rough boy, I'm a really, really rough boy 
 I was raised in a place where I had no choice but to be (rough boy) 
 But tonight I'm gon be gentle wit chu, girl 
 Even though I'm a rough boy 
 Please show love to this rough boy 
 I don't care how they look at me 
 As long as, when you look, I'm the one you see 
 We can make it work, we can make it by 
 Just give me a second, girl, and I will tell you why 
 I'm a rough boy, I'm a really, really rough boy 
 I was raised in a place where I had no choice but to be (rough boy) 
 But tonight I'm gon be gentle wit chu, girl 
 Even though I'm a rough boy 
 Please show love 
 Baby, let the rude boy play guitar, now 
 Baby, let your rough boy play guitar now 
 I'm a rough boy (I'm a rough boy) 
 I'm a really, really rough boy 
 Was raised in a place where I had no choice but to be (rough boy) 
 But tonight I'm gon be gentle wit chu, girl 
 Even though I'm a rough boy 
 Please show love to this rough boy 
 Show love to this rough boy 
 Girl, baby, baby show love to this rough boy
