Lets go 
 So so you think you can tell 
 Heaven from hell 
 Blue skies from pain 
 Can you tell a green field 
 From a cold steel rail 
 A smile from a vail 
 Do you think you can tell 
 Did they get you to trade 
 Your heroes for ghosts 
 Hot ashes for trees 
 Hot air for a cool breeze 
 Cold comfort for change 
 Did you exchange 
 A walk on part in the war 
 For a lead role in the cage 
 Whether your listening to hip hip-hop 
 Or your tuning to rock 
 Refugees on your box 
 We gonna take over ya blocks 
 Lets go 
 How I wish, how I wish you were here 
 We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish-bowl 
 Year after year 
 Running over the same old ground 
 But have we found the same old fears 
 Wish you were here 
 Whether you listening to rock 
 Or you pumping the hip-hop 
 Refugees on your box 
 Critics don't mistake this for just any cover tune 
 I'ma take ya all to the dark side of the moon 
 Kicking in my moms womb this song was just a thought 
 A young refugee labeled, just come with a passport 
 Dad used to tell me about the American dream 
 My dream was waking up the projects 
 A young teen listening to hip-hop 
 My brother tuned me into rock 
 Put me up on pink floyd a band from the british blocks 
 Whether you pumpin the hip hip-hop 
 Or you tuning to rock 
 Refugees in your box we gonna take over your blocks 
 From n.j. to bk to the uk 
 How I wish, how I wish you were here 
 We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish-bowl 
 Year after year 
 Running over the same old ground 
 But have we found the same old fears 
 Wish you were here
