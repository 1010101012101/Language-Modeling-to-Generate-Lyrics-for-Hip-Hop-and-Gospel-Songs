When the East in the house 
 (oh my God) 
 When the East in the house 
 (oh my God) 
 When the East in the house 
 (oh my God) 
 When the East in the house 
 (oh my God) 
 Yeah, this one's for the world right here 
 Sizzla! 
 (Mr. Kalonji, just walked in the buildin') 
 Big up to the far East rulers 
 Welcome to the East, 
 (oh my God) 
 "When the East is in the house" 
 Sometimes I ask myself will the violence ever cease 
 (oh my God) 
 (You know you gon' like it; Kalonji, Wyclef) 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 (oh my God) 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 (oh my God) 
 It's too hot on the floor 
 They got the M-15's 
 (oh my God) 
 We got the M-16's 
 (oh my God, (that's dangerous)) 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 It's too hot on the floor, check it out 
 I saw the ski-mask I didn't see the faces yo 
 Saw the grenade, heard the explosions yo 
 It get worse yo, I can't count the hearses 
 That come out to masses, to churches, the verse is 
 Do unto others as you would have done unto you 
 Well welcome to the devil's penthouse, overlookin hell's view 
 David slew the philistines with a donkey jawbone 
 The same jawbone, I used to make microphone 
 The same microphone I use in New Jerusalem 
 To tell E.T. MC's they gotta phone home 
 Girl I see you in the club but your eyes full of pain 
 Your man a wife-beater, find a new man 
 And for my little sisters in the misery 
 Sweet sixteen, you ain't alone in the pregnancy 
 I pour some liquors for my homies that passed 
 Sit back while I'm writin' watch you fade in the paragraph, paragraph, paragraph 
 Welcome to the East, 
 (oh my God) 
 Sometimes I ask myself will the violence ever cease 
 (oh my God) 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 (oh my God) 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 (oh my God) 
 It's too hot on the floor 
 They got the M-15's 
 (oh my God) 
 We got the M-16's 
 (oh my God, (that's dangerous)) 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 It's too hot on the floor 
 Sizzla, Check it out 
 All things she plant the explosives with fuel in line 
 We be dimed, that's too much screwin' 'time 
 Cuttin' you off, the halls reach the governor 
 With pass enough plastic and the found for substance 
 I prophecy they gon' call on the attack 
 Must I see there and keeping this a back 
 Each can play guitar, 'cause those bands a saluting 
 Everyday someone ferments these drive-by shootings 
 Will there ever be peace on the Earth 
 With human acts we shall not have peace on the Earth 
 Be good leave it up for firm and just 
 What's going on in neighborhoods today is not respected 
 Welcome to the East, 
 (oh my God) 
 Sometimes I ask myself will the violence ever cease 
 (oh my God) 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 (oh my God) 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 (oh my God) 
 It's too hot on the floor 
 They got the M-15's 
 (oh my God) 
 We got the M-16's 
 (oh my God, (that's dangerous)) 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 It's too hot on the floor 
 Dance, she's in the city of Gods 
 Dancin' the Capoeira 
 I see her in Brazil, eyy 
 Her cry, sound like seven million violins 
 Knowin' that her man won't be back tomorrow, she cries 
 Welcome to the East, 
 (oh my God) 
 Sometimes I ask myself will the violence ever cease 
 (oh my God) 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 (oh my God) 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 It's too hot on the floor man 
 (oh my God) 
 It's too hot on the floor 
 They got the M-15's, Africa 
 We got the M-16's, Africa 
 It's too hot on the floor man, Africa 
 It's too hot on the floor 
 Yeah, this where we all meet right here 
 One mind one soul one heart 
 On violins we got, the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan, yeah 
 On guitar, my man David Rosen, yeah 
 Jerry Wonder on the bass 
 Sizzla, breddern for life 
 Charles the conductor I see you
