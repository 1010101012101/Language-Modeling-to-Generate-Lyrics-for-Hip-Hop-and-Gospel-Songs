Death threats 
 In the middle of the night 
 Cowards on the telephone 
 Say I've got a pretty daughter with a pretty wife 
 So I got no choice 
 Got on my chopper, got my vest on 
 (Choppered up, vest on) 
 Got on my chopper, got my vest on 
 (Choppered up, vest on) 
 Got on my chopper, got my vest on 
 Yeah, I'm ridin' towards my enemy 
 Before they come and get my family 
 Biggie used to ask what's beef 
 It's when my own countryman wanna kill me 
 I used to rip a flag in the air like I'm part of the set 
 But now it seems like the same set is givin' me death threats 
 All I wanted to be was Commander-in-chief 
 But it seems like they wanna see me six feet deep 
 But no weapon used against me shall prosper 
 (Prosper, prosper, prosper, prosper) 
 Death threats 
 In the middle of the night 
 (What they said?) 
 Cowards on the telephone 
 Say I've got a pretty daughter with a pretty wife 
 So I got no choice 
 Got on my chopper, got my vest on 
 (Choppered up, vest on) 
 Got on my chopper, got my vest on 
 (Choppered up, vest on) 
 Got on my chopper, got my vest on 
 Yeah, I'm ridin' towards my enemy 
 Before they come and get my family 
 Then they labeled me 
 (A populist) 
 Pushed the decision back before they kicked me out the race 
 So they met in Peurto Princess in secrecy 
 They said they heard a rumor that I met with Irish Steve 
 But all I wanted to be was Commander-in-chief 
 So when the food price rise, everyone still eats 
 Give them some books, make sure everybody reads 
 Illiteracy is modern day slavery

 Before they come and get my family 
 The coin that I bet heads on, been tails all along 
 On both sides of the coin 
 So I'm careful who I eat with 
 'Cause if I'm poisoned, a dead man can't get elected 
 Preacher laid his hands on me, said it's a prophesy 
 But like Bijou Banton, it's my destiny 
 Yo, and I kept the crowd calm 
 But they runnin' out of patience, they got short talk and long arms 
 We disgrace, story come from photo press 
 All the music where the scene gets tense 
 And the perpetrator says, "If you love your life 
 You would take the next plane but you can't survive" 
 You see I won't get the Peace Prize 
 'Cause I got a rifle hangin' by my bedside 
 A million voices goin' feel like a genocide 
 If my people don't fight for their equal right 
 You see I won't get the Peace Prize 
 'Cause I got a rifle hangin' by my bedside 
 A million voices goin' feel like a genocide 
 If my people don't fight for their equal right 
 Death threats 
 Me ain't scared 
 In the middle of the night

 (Choppered up, vest on) 
 Got on my chopper, got my vest on 
 (Choppered up, vest on) 
 Got on my chopper, got my vest on 
 Yeah, David shoot Goliath with a slingshot
