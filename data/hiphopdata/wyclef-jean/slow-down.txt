 We cry for peace 
 But we live for war 
 You know I got that shot in the chevy what it is? 
 We ain't start the wire taps down in Baltimore 
 But I still slangin' bricks where I live 
 Sometimes she love me, sometimes she love me not 
 Doin' ten now my girl turning tricks at the crib 
 But let check out his eyes in the inner city Chi 
 Layin' down ASAP, everybody in the trap gettin' killed 
 Evil lurks in the heavenly disguise 
 Tryin' to get the ruler, all I need is about a mil 
 I seen two birds crash into two New York giants 
 Bush still lyin', he don't never keep it real 
 I wish Katrina spoke French at the quarter to New Orleans 
 Haha, but you'd a told her that 
 But how we smoke French back, seduced this stone 
 (okay) 
 Told this is your death, please don't rain on my people 
 Where'd the hope go? Where'd the hope go 
 (I don't know) 
 I see the whole world turn into a warzone 
 (What?) 
 Ain't no love in the city, keep your vest on 
 (got that right) 
 Guns 'n roses, welcome to the jungle 
 On the flip side 
 (ay) 
 , she shakin' her back side 
 (shake it for me) 
 That's the only way tuition gon' come right 
 He got a crush on Mary Jane 
 (ay, ay) 
 If you ain't got five on she ain't doing her thang 
 (come on, you know you need to) 
 Slow down, young girl 
 (Keep it real hun, you gotta keep it real hun) 
 Slow down somebody gon' crash 
 (come on, you know you need to) 
 Slow down 
 (you know you need to, ay ay) 
 Young girl 
 (okay) 
 (Keep it real hun, you gotta keep it real hun) 
 Slow down somebody gon' crash 
 If you livin' in the street, you know your livin free 
 And if you ain't you know your doin' time like me 
 Thugs with the heat are the coldest ones to meet 
 You can catch yourself a case get a fine do three 
 We flyin high, but still can't touch the sky 
 But on conspiracy you're doing ten at the least 
 Everybody's a gangsta, but nobody wanna die 
 With all this snitchin' you might never see the streets 
 Nuclear testing, replacin' the SATs 
 With all this going on why they worried about me 
 Stem cell research, there's another you another me 
 I'm just hustling in the streets tryin' to flip a couple keys 
 With what goes up, must come down, the laws of gravity 
 I know I see it happen to my partner big neege, We miss ya shawty 
 To win at chess, you've got to trap the king 
 (ay) 
 Where'd the hope go? Where'd the hope go 
 (I don't know) 
 I see the whole world turn into a warzone 
 (What?) 
 Ain't no love in the city, keep your vest on 
 (got that right) 
 Guns 'n roses, welcome to the jungle 
 On the flip side 
 (ay) 
 , she shakin' her back side 
 (shake it for me) 
 That's the only way tuition gon' come right 
 He got a crush on Mary Jane 
 (ay, ay) 
 If you ain't got five on she ain't doing her thang 
 (let's get it) 
 Slow down, young girl 
 (Keep it real hun, you gotta keep it real hun) 
 Slow down somebody gon' crash 
 (come on, you know you need to) 
 Slow down 
 (ay ay, you know you used to) 
 Young girl 
 (okay) 
 (Keep it real hun, you gotta keep it real hun) 
 Slow down somebody gon' crash 
 (come on, you know you need to) 
 Everybody, know we gon' keep rollin' 
 When the police rollin' and your coke dealer told 'em 
 What you been doing, boy better slow down 
 Ay ay, slow down 
 Ay ay, you wanna show 'em that da dope keep coming 
 But if shit keep runnin' their mouth 
 Eye your stuck jacking coming for ya better slow down 
 Ay ay, slow down 
 (everytime homeboy) 
 Slow down 
 (start snitchin', homeboy) 
 ay ay 
 Hey I remember get money 
 (get money) 
 All we do is get money 
 (get money) 
 Till the feds raided the trap and took my thang from me 
 Put me in a room alone, separated the click from me 
 (click from me) 
 Next thing you my lawyer said my partner snitched on me, on me 
 Now ain't that a bitch homie, 
 (they ain't have a thing on us) 
 Until you started telling now they talking big numbers 
 We could've split charges up, against five or six summer 
 (summers) 
 Instead you tryin' to talk telling so you could walk 
 How could you tell 'em who we sold told to? Everything we bought? 
 How we used to get in, all the way till we can ship it off? 
 (Who woulda thought?) 
 Thought 
 Hey keep it pimpin', wait a minute 
 Ay keep it pimpin' wait a minute, ay 
 Where'd the hope go? Where'd the hope go? 
 I see the whole world turn into a warzone 
 Ain't no love in the city keep your vest on 
 (ya) 
 Guns 'n roses, welcome to the jungle 
 (ay, ay) 
 On the flip side, she shakin' her back side 
 That's the only way tuition gonna come right
