(Wyclef Jean) 
 Yo I'm happy to be in the South 
 To set off my tour in the countryside 
 But who better to set it off for me than this man right here 
 (Kenny Rogers) 
 Yo this Kenny Rogers chillin' on the country side 
 With men like Wyclef (uh-huh) Jerry Wonder (uh-huh) 
 Big Jack (mm-hmm) Big Beast (mm-hmm) 
 And we gon' do something like this for you 
 You got to know when to hold 'em (Yeah, Yeah!) 
 Know when to fold 'em (DJ's, DJ's!) 
 Know when to walk away (HIP-HOP, HIP-HOP!) 
 Know when to run... (Yeah, Yeah!) 
 You got to count your dub-plates (GHETTO, GHETTO, GHETTO) 
 Before you touch the turntables (ALL HOODS!) 
 'Cause if you run out of big tunes 
 That means your sound is done (Y'ALL READY?) 
 Chorus: Kenny Rogers 
 You got to know when to hold 'em 
 Know when to fold 'em (soundbwoys) 
 Know when to walk away 
 Know when to run... (hey, hey, hey, hey..) 
 You got to count your dub-plates 
 Before you touch the turntables (DJ's) 
 'Cause if you run out of big tunes 
 That means your sound is done 
 (Pharoahe Monch) 
 Get the hell up! 
 'Clef said, get the hell up! 
 Now throw your hands in the sky (BO! BO! BO! BO!) 
 Brooklyn in the back shootin craps y'all whassup? 
 Ladies; lookin' hot and pretty 
 Doin' your thing in the club high saditty 
 WORLDWIDE - the gritty committee pity the fool that 
 Act {shitty} in the midst of the calm, the witty
