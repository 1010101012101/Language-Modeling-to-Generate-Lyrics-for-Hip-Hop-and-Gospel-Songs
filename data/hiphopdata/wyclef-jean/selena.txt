 True story, I got my green card in my hand right now 
 Let me see them lighters up in the air 
 As I reminisce 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 I reminisce, I reminisce 
 (here's another one) 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Things done changed but they stay the same 
 You can fake that swagga but can't fake the name 
 'Cause I got the slang to make the chitty bang bang 
 Bidi bidi bom bom, bidi bidi bom bom 
 That's when I asked Melissa, "What's that song?" 
 She said, "That's Selena playing all night long." 
 I said "Where you from?" She said "Mexico." 
 We got that bidi bidi bom bom, bidi bidi bom bom 
 (Bidi bidi bom bom) 
 Oh Selena 
 (Bidi bidi bom bom) 
 Oh Selena 
 (Bidi bidi bom) 
 She's got that fire 
 Americana, raised in America 
 I wish I had a chance to meet her 
 (Bidi bidi bom) 
 Selena 
 I Reminisce, I reminisce 
 A yo Clef let me get that balia 
 I'm a shimmy shimmy on just like Selena 
 Manos arriba reppin latinas 
 With the bidi bidi bom bom, bidi bidi bom bom 
 Selena brought pride to a generation 
 Inspiration is the hope for the immigration 
 I can still hear your voice echoing through my system 
 With the bidi bidi bom bom, bidi bidi bom bom 
 (Bidi bidi bom bom) 
 Oh Selena 
 (Bidi bidi bom bom) 
 Oh Selena 
 (Bidi bidi bom) 
 She's got that fire 
 Americana, raised in America 
 I wish I had a chance to meet her 
 (Bidi bidi bom) 
 Selena 
 And when the heavens open I saw Selia Cruz 
 I heard her say "Asucar turn this on." 
 Tito Puente's dressed in white 
 Playing timbales while the angels sing with Selena
