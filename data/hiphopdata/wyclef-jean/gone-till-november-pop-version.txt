(Wyclef - Spoken) 
 I wanna dedicate this song, Gone Till November... 
 To all you ladies out there, crying all alone in your room 
 And all you fellas, going down south... Not making it back... 
 May the lord bless your soul, I love you girl 
 (Wyclef - Chorus) 
 Every time I make a run 
 Girl you turn around and cry 
 I ask myself, why oh why? 
 See you must understand 
 I can't work a nine to five 
 So I'll be Gone...Till November 
 Said I'll be Gone Till November 
 I'll be Gone Till November 
 Yo, tell my girl yo I'll be Gone Till November 
 I'll be Gone Till November 
 I'll be Gone Till November 
 Yo, tell my girl yo I'll be Gone Till November 
 January, February, March, April, May... 
 I see you crying, but girl I can't stay 
 I'll be Gone Till November 
 I'll be Gone Till November... 
 And give a kiss to my mother... 
 (Wyclef - Verse One) 
 Girl I gotta leave, please don't cry 
 When I come back, you know the limit's the sky 
 I'll take you out to dinner, to your favorite spot 
 Feed you an aphrodisiac just to get you hot 
 Drive-by movies, by a cemetery 
 If my corpse could talk then I would tell you I was sorry 
 Lifestyles of The Rich and Famous, 
 Some die with a name, some die nameless 
 (Wyclef - Verse Two) 
 We had nothin' 
 I had to do something 
 So I'm Knocking On Heaven's Door, like I'm Bob Dylan 
 Ever comtemplating, the charges I'm facing 
 My new-born son, I hope I see his graduation 
 Take him to the movies, by the cemetery 
 If my corpse could talk then I would tell him, I was sorry 
 Lifestyles of The Rich and Famous 
 Some die with a name, some die nameless!
