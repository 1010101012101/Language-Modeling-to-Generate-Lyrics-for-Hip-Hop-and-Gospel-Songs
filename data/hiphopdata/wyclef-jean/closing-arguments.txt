In closing, ladies and gentlemen of the jury 
 I'm not gonna sit here and bore you with a long, drawn out story 
 Or excuse, of why I think wyclef is guilty 
 I'm gonna stand by the exhibits as well as the tapes 
 And songs such as jeapordy, till novemeber, all the girls, 
 And bubblegoose, which stand side by side with my allegations 
 I rest my case 
 Ok, uh, ladiessss, and gentle-men, of the juwy 
 As you can see nuttin has been proven here today 
 Deez witnesses dey brought ere don't not have evidence 
 To incriminate my client eh? 
 If he's not guilty he's innocent 
 If he's not detrimental to the society therefore he positive! 
 As I say before, dis case is pure bishop 
 Your honor see, this, this is exactly what I'm talkin' about 
 I mean I've been meaning to ask this the whole time 
 Who the hell is bishop? 
 Eh? 
 And and why the hell hasn't he been brought on the stand? 
 Bishop, bishop, not true, false, bishop 
 Oh, bullshit! 
 Oui
