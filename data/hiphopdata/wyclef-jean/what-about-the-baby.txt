I want to apologize for makin' you wait so long for the sequel 
 Wyclef, Mary J., this one called, 
 "What About the Baby" 
 You ever been like 
 Let me talk to my daughter 
 Daughter this is your papa 
 I know it's been a while 
 We haven't talked 
 But daddy you've been gone 
 And me and mom have been all alone 
 It's been a struggle and you weren't there for us 
 He say 
 Okay, when I called you 
 She wouldn't put you on the phone 
 She call the police, restrainin' order 
 Fifty feet from my home 
 I tried, I ain't lyin' 
 It's so sad that the heavens cryin, ayy 
 Once a boy and twice a man 
 I'm just tryin to do the best I can 
 Give me a chance girl 
 A grown man ain't supposed to cry 
 So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice 
 Everything gon' be alright 
 Baby girl I'm by your side, dry your eyes 
 Let's talk this over 
 Now see I heard everything that you told her 
 But it's gon' take more than words 
 For you to be a father, uh-huh 
 Responsibilities of a man 
 Like stayin' faithful just for the fam' 
 What if she knew that you chose 
 Another over her mother, oh 
 So you called her 
 And I wouldn't put her on the phone 
 I called the police yes, restrainin' order 
 Fifty feet, from my home 
 I tried, I ain't lyin' 
 It's so sad that the heavens are cryin', yeah 
 Once a girl, twice of a man 
 And I'nma try to do the best I can 
 I can't give you a chance, no 
 A woman ain't supposed to cry 
 So why don't you just wipe your eyes, dry your eyes 
 You've learned a house is not a home 
 When you're living all alone and you want back home 
 Wait a minute, girl 
 You're my joy, happiness that you bring 
 Turn the fall back to spring girl, you're my bling 
 You a hip-hop song I heard for the first time time 
 Studied all the words to the rhyme 
 You're my life, without you there's no sun, there's no moon 
 There's no stars, shinin' in the night 
 But if I give you a chance, would you show me you care 
 Be a man, no matter what the circumstances, ah 
 A grown man ain't supposed to cry 
 So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice 
 You've learned a house is not a home 
 When you're living all alone, and you want back home 
 (Dry your eyes, dry your eyes) 
 A grown man ain't supposed to cry 
 So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice 
 (What about the baby? What about the baby?) 
 Everything gon' be alright 
 Baby girl I'm by your side, I apologize 
 I cry, and I cry, I cry 
 (What about the baby?)
