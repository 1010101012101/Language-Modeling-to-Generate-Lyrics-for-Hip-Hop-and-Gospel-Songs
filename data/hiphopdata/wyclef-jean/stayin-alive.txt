We got the Refugees All-Stars rubba dubbin' in the club 
 Wyclef Jean, John Forte, Prizewell 
 Nah mean the streets are gettin' a little crazy 
 Looka, looka, looka, looka, looka 
 Looka, looka, looka, here looka shorty got back 
 Should I ask her for a dance 
 Hold on, there's too many in a wolf pack 
 And besides Dirtycash talkin' to her 
 Buyin' her fake furs and takin' her to the fever 
 Quite as his kept that ain't even his Benz 
 She spends his franklins at the malls with her friends 
 Material girl livin' in a material world 
 But it's all right 'cause it's Saturday night 
 So mista funkmaster pump the Bee-Gees 
 And all you college students bring your ouijas' 
 Check the spellin', R E F U G E E 
 Get the CD from Sam Goody he, he 
 You ain't even close wit the rhymes that you wrote 
 Don't be mad 'cause you broke 
 Let me clear my throat, ah huh, ah huh 
 John Forte grab the mic roots, sway it this way 
 I more than just a rhymer, you still a small timer 
 Hopin' that the game treat that ass a little kinda 
 Every step tango'd, your beat don't concern me 
 I'm eatin' mangoes in Trinadad wit attorneys 
 (Oh yeah) 
 My crews slang flow worldwide like a current 
 Wit da every spot where nobody get insurance 
 Brotha do the math, you ain't half near exotic 
 My man's claim true, you forget about it 
 Pope hoe just a new stance like my influence 
 Well, recognize you a lie tryin' do it 
 Got juice told your lady oops, we nuts baby 
 Smooth and charizmatic, automatic, you gonna save me 
 God bless the day that my sons survive 
 We strive to teach the youth baby and stay alive 
 Refugee camp, nuts baby 
 John Forte, yo, watch your lady 
 Yo, watch your lady 
 Eh ah, special ill rhyme Dirtycash 
 Yo, if you got more than dollar in your pocket 
 Right now, put your hands up 
 Yo yo, you can tell by the way I roll 
 Shorty, that I'm a ladies man, a business man 
 Condos down the shore, multi million pension plans 
 But it ain't in my plan to make move without the fam 
 I keep it intact, you Clef do the track 
 John play da mack while I pay the tax 
 Business as usual, watchin' suspects 
 Steal my assets, get cut with gillettes 
 We built this concept, connect like nynex 
 Drinks at the bar, my American express 
 Yo, I cook up, cook up 
 The cop a pull up, pull up 
 Then I cuff up, cuff up, you who's callin' bluff 
 Now you shook up, shook up 
 'Cause you lock up, lock up 
 When I love up, love up, you who's callin' bluff 
 Hey yo, John is chillin' 
 Dirtycash chillin' 
 What more can I say we livin' 
 That's what we got, we got it good 
 And since you understood, we be 
 Yeah, live at the carnival, 97 till infinite, ha 
 Refugee All-Stars 
 Can't stop the shining, can't stop the shining

 You wanna stop the shining, you wanna stop the shining 
 Can't stop the shining, can't stop the shining
