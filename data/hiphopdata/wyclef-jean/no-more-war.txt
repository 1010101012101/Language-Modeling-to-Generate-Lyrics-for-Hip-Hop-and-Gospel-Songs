Light is in the air right now 
 Two thousand and two rebel music 
 The saga continues listen, children 
 What's the problem in Manhattan 
 Every ten men they look like Bin Laden 
 So I have problems when I go to the airport 
 First thing they do they wanna ask me for my passport 
 They said, "Wyclef we love the Fugues the score" 
 But did anybody give you any strange package 
 To bring on board I was like 'no' 
 Here comes your national guards 
 This look like a scene from the movie Star Wars 
 One foot in, one foot out standing in the airplane 
 I'm on tour I'm on my way to Japan 
 First class, dark shades let the fuschia out bed 
 I want to sleep but keep my eyes on the cock pit 
 Why just think they stay target the pilot 
 We gonna take over the plane 
 Like the Los Angeles riot, riot, riot 
 The Middle East, the Middle East 
 The street pack more heat than the Middle East 
 The Middle East, the Middle East 
 When will the violence sleep in the Middle East 
 The Middle East 
 The street pack more heat than the Middle East 
 The Middle East, the Middle East 
 When will the violence 
 Say peace, say peace we don't want no war no more 
 Let me hear the streets 
 Peace, oh peace we don't want no war no more 
 Let me hear the Middle East now 
 Peace, oh peace we don't want no war no more 
 Let me hear the U.S.A. say peace 
 Say peace Lord, peace 
 We don't want no war no more 
 We don't want no war no more 
 We don't want no war no more 
 We don't want no war no more 
 We don't want no war no more 
 We don't want no war no more 
 We don't want no war no more 
 Peace, oh peace we don't want no war no more 
 No, no let me hear you say 
 Peace, say peace we don't want no war no more 
 No, no, no, no 
 Say peace, oh peace we don't want no war no more 
 No more riots 
 Riots, riots, riots
