 Yo, engineer, turn me up, yo 
 I started off in the underground 
 From mono to stereo 
 Now I'm surround sound 
 Blowin' through your tubes 
 Leavin' holes through your speakers 
 Crackin' through your tweeters 
 My frequency's off the meters 
 Jam pack arenas from here to Bangkok 
 I'm ahead of my time like Jimmy Hendrix played Woodstock 
 Me, I'm playin' Hoodstock 
 Before I had the dreadlocks I used to reminisce 
 Should I do music or sell rocks 
 Grow my own crops 
 Livin' in the PJs 
 That's when an angel, Gabriel, said 
 It's all a masquerade 
 Eyes wit no face, sneakers wit no lace 
 I feel the earth spinnin but I'm standing in the same space 
 Wit no trace of what happened last night 
 I seen two fiends fightin over a crack pipe 
 Now I'm watchin TV 
 My antenna was a clothes hanger 
 Blurry vision Mista Mondehan David Banner 
 Flip the data 
 The kids are wearin bandanas 
 Totin hammers 
 Aimin at your medulla oblongata 
 Blow Blow 
 A young thug wit a slim figure 
 Romantic type like the movie Casablanca 
 Herb seller once got busted by a undercover buyer 
 My supplier was a Gypsie cab driver 
 That's when I realized I need to find a new hustle 
 Livin' in the jungle 
 The guitar became my muscle 
 I scribe through snake eyes that wanted my crucified 
 Y'all thought that I was drownin but I was getting baptized 
 Now behold I heard you sold twenty mill 
 But wit no street credibility you overkill 
 Y'all ain't real 
 Talkin' bout keep it gangsta 
 Only if you knew the gangsta sent me to shank you 
 Gank you, gank you, tie up your ankles 
 And if that ain't enough I call hinchmens to lynch you 
 Now at the funeral I could see the priest bless you 
 But in the after life I'ma still touch you 
 Knockin' on heaven's door you beggin to get in 
 That's when the Son of Man greets you wit the face of Satan 
 Now you look frightened in the belly of the whale 
 That's when the warden say I wanna welcome you to hell 
 Bones is five bucks 
 Get off the phone, time's up 
 I seen him cut from his head to his (scratch $#@%) 
 You wish you would wish you could 
 Wishin got you here 
 You screamin so loud that a deaf man could hear 
 Back to the silence 
 No more droppin' science 
 Everybody rappin' bout diamonds and violence 
 And A&R's all they do is charge credit cards 
 And when the bill comes 
 They blame it on the rap stars 
 Now how you figure 
 I ain't rent a car 
 I wasn't at the spa 
 I ain't buy the bar 
 Now here's a Jew 
 When you get your first record deal 
 Don't subject yourself to the mass appeal 
 First class, caviar in the ?Ville 
 In the new S class wit da Jordan wheels 
 Remember the music in the streets like the streets 
 You know the code of the streets 
 Everybody tryin' to eat 
 The evidence is concrete 
 I'm tired of the same song 
 You take me out 
 You must be high off of heroine 
 Sharper than I ever been 
 This one gon get a ten 
 Rappers, I'ma murder y'all wit your own medicine 
 I move with faith 
 I never have doubt 
 I'm so hungry you would think I'm just comin' out 
 But I been here before from Blunted to The Score 
 To the Carnival, Ecleftic, World Tour 
 I'm poison 
 Whores waitin in the back door 
 They want me to rock they boat and shift them on shore 
 That's when the Father said, 
 ?Take heed to this lesson' 
 They wanna cut your hair like Delilah did Samson 
 I felt that 
 So I went back to my format 
 Raps in backpack 
 Gats for car jacks 
 Hats for pussy cats 
 Cause AIDS I don't want that 
 And for the DJ's here's somethin' y'all can scratch 
 Technique twelve 
 The needle hits the wax 
 Hypnotize the crowd 
 The dance floor's jam packed 
 Now sing along like a Negro spiritual 
 No one got shot tonight 
 It's a miracle 
 But what's this I hear 
 Y'all wanna take my spot 
 You got a better chance puttin' a gorilla in a headlock 
 I'm too focused I can see through your lens 
 You ain't a G, just a wannabe kingpin 
 So, the next time y'all wanna pay for protection 
 I suggest that you hit up the Haitian Sicilian
