Yeah 
 This box of chocolate and dozens of roses 
 I wasn't looking back around the way 
 I didn't try to be a player 
 So many things that I wanna say 
 You know, I got a little wiser 
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight 
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight 
 I ain't got many friends, I can talk to 
 No-one's around when I'm in trouble 
 You know I would do anything for you 
 We don't have to keep it under cover 
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight 
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight 
 Come on 
 L o v e y o u 
 I ain't tryna lose your love tonight 
 I just wanna make you feel alright 
 L o v e y o u

 Kiss you love you hold you tight 
 I wasn't looking back around the way 
 I didn't try to be a player 
 So many things that I wanna say 
 You know I got a little wiser 
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight 
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight 
 Ain't no need to leave girl, please close the door 
 And don't forget what I told you 
 I wanna do you right 'cause I did you wrong 
 Another shoulder to cry upon 
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight 
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight

 Kiss you love you hold you tight 
 The way my heart beats for you mentioning your name 
 One touch never enough you're driving me insane 
 Swing bee, take me back, who would I blame but myself 
 Need you in my life simple and plain 
 Crazy nuts, argument, running towards the door 
 Lying to myself not wanting you no more 
 No matter what we've been through you're the man that I adore 
 You're the only one I need in this world 
 See, people used to tell me I was crazy 
 Told me not to give in 
 Told me that you'll never love me 
 All the business we pretend 
 I told 'em mind their business 
 But they're not in my position 
 When I said I was in love 
 They said that I was tripping 
 I cut the height as often 
 I got into my man 
 'Cause I taking for all the years 
 He takes me as I am 
 The way I feel about it 
 It was God's perfect plan 
 You're the only I need, I'm not these girls 
 So let me hear you say 
 I wasn't looking back around the way 
 I ain't tryna be a player 
 So many things that I wanna say 
 You know I got a little wiser 
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight 
 I don't wanna lose your love tonight 
 Come on 
 L o v e y o u 
 I ain't tryna lose your love tonight 
 I just wanna make you feel alright 
 L o v e y o u 
 I do hope you can stay the night 
 Kiss you, love you, hold you tight
