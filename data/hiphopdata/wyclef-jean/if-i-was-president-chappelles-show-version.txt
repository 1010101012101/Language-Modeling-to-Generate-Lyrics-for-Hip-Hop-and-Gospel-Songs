Election time is coming... 
 If I was President 
 I'd get elected on Friday 
 Assassinated on Saturday 
 Buried on Sunday 
 If I was president, 
 If I was president 
 An old man told me 
 Instead of spending 
 Billions on the war 
 We can use some of that money 
 In the ghetto 
 I know some so poor 
 When it rains that's when they shower 
 Screaming fight the power 
 That's when the vulture devours 
 If I was President 
 I'd get elected on Friday 
 Assassinated on Saturday 
 Buried on Sunday 
 If I was president, 
 If I was president, 
 If I was president, 
 If I was president 
 But the radio won't play this 
 They call it rebel music, 
 How can you refuse it?, 
 Children of Moses 
 If I was President 
 I'd get elected on Friday 
 Assassinated on Saturday 
 Buried on Sunday 
 If I was president, 
 If I was president, 
 Tell the children the truth, the truth 
 Christopher Columbus didn't discover America 
 Tell them the truth, 
 The truth, Yeah 
 Tell them about Marcus Garvey 
 Tell the children the truth, yeah 
 The Truth 
 Tell them about Martin Luther King 
 Tell them the truth 
 The truth 
 Tell them about JFK 
 If I was President, 
 If I was President 
 I'd get elected on Friday 
 Assassinate on Saturday 
 Buried on Sunday 
 If I was president, 
 If I was president
