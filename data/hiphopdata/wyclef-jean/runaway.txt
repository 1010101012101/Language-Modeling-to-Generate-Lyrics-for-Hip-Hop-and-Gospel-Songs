"(Wyclef) 
 To my people doing time 
 To my people rest in peace (y'all ready for the refugee camp?) 
 Introducing Earth, Wind and Fire 
 Yah yah yah 
 Come on come on come on 
 No money in my pocket 
 Gotta get a no limit 
 So I became America's most wanted 
 All I ever wanted was a fancy car 
 A crib for my mom and a mastercard 
 Baby you know it's in Hollywood 
 New cop flicks with Clint Eastwood 
 Went from a teen to a young adult 
 No excuses ain'tt my fault 
 Runaway 
 We living like runaways 
 Wake up 
 Stretching in the morning 
 Trying to make it through the day 
 Brush my teeth 
 Hit the streets 
 Where there's heat 
 We afford to beef 
 Hoping one day 
 We don't have to run away 
 (Gotta Escape) 
 I didn't want to runaway 
 But I had to get a way yo (gotta get away) 
 We didn't want to runaway 
 But we had to get away yo (gotta get away) 
 I didn't want to leave astray 
 But sometimes I gotta get away yo (gotta get away) 
 I didn't want to go away 
 But I had to go away yo 
 Yo G&B where you at? 
 (Product G&B) 
 Momma came home from a hard days work 
 At day time a maid at night time a nurse 
 Work so hard to make sure we survived 
 Living a ghetto paradise 
 Sometimes I wake up screaming in the middle of the night 
 Hoping that darkness brings me light 
 Praying for that better day where we won't have to runaway 
 Runaway 
 We living like runaways 
 Wake up 
 Stretching in the morning 
 Trying to make it through the day 
 Brush my teeth 
 Hit the streets 
 Where there's heat 
 We afford to beef 
 Hoping one day 
 We don't have to run away 
 I didn't want to runaway 
 But I had to get a way yo (gotta get away) 
 We didn't want to runaway 
 But we had to get away yo (gotta get away) 
 I didn't want to leave astray 
 But sometimes I gotta get away yo (gotta get away) 
 I didn't want to go away 
 But I had to go away yo
