(Wyclef Jean) (Claudette Ortiz of City High) *Together* 
 I'm jus sitting here playing the guitar 
 (City high igh igh igh igh) 
 Claudette, Wyclef 
 (Excuse me if you see me screaming 
 But deep in my mind I'm only dreaming 
 Because if I wake girl and your, not by my side 
 I feel like half of me is no longer alive 
 So please shorty, before you walk out that door, boo-by 
 Would you listen to my song?) 
 (If only, I give you one last chance 
 With the devil you can no longer dance 
 You've got to be faithful, So we could be fruitful 
 Build a family and follow God destiny 
 So just, before I want to reply papi 
 I might listen to your song) 
 (Boo, before you walk out that door, listen!) 
 *They say two wrongs don't make it right 
 So if I'm wrong, I ain't tryin' to fight 
 I'm tryin' to have some dinner with some candlelight 
 Lay up in the bed and make love all night* 
 (So papi I won't leave, maybe I'll just stay 
 But promise me that you'll do the same) 
 (Girl I 'm gonna love you like I never loved) 
 (Touch me like you've never touched me) 
 (Yo if you give me the chance girl I'm gonna show you) 
 (Now baby I say, that I forgive you 
 But I ain't gonna forgive what you put me through) (oh baby baby') 
 (But I have grown from a thug to a man 
 Built my castle with bricks, and No longer with sand) 
 (Oh girl) (And just before I walk out that door, baby 
 I might listen to your song) 
 (Boo before you walk out that door, listen!) 
 (I'm so used to the pain that I can't see the sunshine no more 
 I'm so used to the pain that the first sickness feels like a cure) 
 (But if only you gave me the keys to your soul 
 And let me in, I'm gonna love you,) 
 (Over and over and over again, yeah yeah yeah) 
 (I'm not gon stay out on the block no more 
 I'll come home early girl, I promise) (Ooh yeah yeah..)
