This joint rite here 
 It goes out for the fellaz 
 Who be creepin' in the ladies home 
 When their man ain't home 
 Ladies have me saying 
 Do DO do DO do DO... 
 If ya ain't treating you girlfriend rite 
 Trust me when I tell you this 
 One day you won't be missed 
 Some one will replace you kiss 
 Ya wanna be hardcore like the rapper jadakiss 
 Or a thug like me 
 Will be up in your house, house, house, house 
 Cooking breakfast in the morning 
 I know u've heard these words b4 
 But u've never heard them quite like this 
 Ur gunna find your self livin' all by yourself 
 Who woulda ever thought that this stranger she would share her wealth 
 A stranger like me 
 Is lying under her sheets, sheets, sheets, sheets 
 Sheets, sheets, sheets, sheets 
 This is a warning red alert emergency 
 If you can't find ur girl 
 That means she in with me 
 She said you hand an argument 
 So I bought her roses 
 Ya know what comes next 
 When the door closes 
 You don't like her smile 
 So you treat her foul 
 You only give her attention when in on the prowl 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 And now you guilty conscience got you acting wild 
 And now you wanna flipmode like your busta rhymes 
 This is a warning red alert emergency 
 If can't find your girl 
 She's at work with me 
 We'll be eating brunch 
 When your having lunch 
 You don't even call 
 To see what she wants 
 You don't like her smile 
 So you treat her foul 
 You only give her attention when I'm on the prowl 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 Now you guilty conscience got you acting wild 
 Now you wanna flipmode like you busta rhymes 
 This is a warning 
 It's a radar warning 
 My thoughts are talking to you rite now 
 You need to hold her 
 And consoul her 
 Never, never, never be afraid to tell her 
 That you love her 
 Get on the fone and call your girlfriend rite now 
 You shoulda listen to her 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 You shoulda listen to her 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 Oh you shoulda listen to her 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 Sometimes you shoulda listen to her 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 Take her out for dinner 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 Take her to the moviez 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 She lookin' groovy 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 That kinda girl rite there 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 Who used to listen to her 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 Sometimes you jus listen to her 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 Listen to her 
 (Shoulda listen to her) 
 Sometimes jus listen to her 
 (Shoulda listen to her)
