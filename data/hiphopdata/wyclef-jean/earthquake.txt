Yeah, aye 
 Earthquake, down there in Haiti 
 Earthquake, in the past of Chile 
 Earthquake, in the hand Indonesia 
 Earthquake, in the events of China 
 Earthquake, is comin' to America 
 Earthquakes are there in California 
 Earthquake, warn ya people in the city 
 That the Earth is gettin' angry 
 I asked Earth what have we done 
 She said we buildin' too much bombs 
 So there's too many sons that won't see their father 
 Too many daughters that won't see their mother 
 Too many grandmas that won't see their grand-kids 
 'Cause they are in the rubble in Port Au Prince 
 Earthquake, down there in Haiti 
 Earthquake, in the past of Chile 
 Earthquake, in the hand Indonesia 
 Earthquake, in the events of China 
 Earthquake, is comin' to America 
 Earthquakes are there in California 
 Earthquake, warn ya people in the city 
 That the Earth is gettin' angry 
 That's when the earth started talkin' rude 
 Say she's thirteen, she's a prostitute 
 I tried to beg for the young girl's life 
 But when the earthquake came, it took her to the other side 
 Then I asked the Earth, who's next? 
 She said, those that's polluting the planet 
 They killin' everything, movin' flowers and abusing mankind 
 And the only thing left is Armageddon 
 Earthquake, down there in Haiti 
 Earthquake, in the past of Chile 
 Earthquake, in the hand Indonesia 
 Earthquake, in the events of China 
 Earthquake, is comin' to America 
 Earthquakes are there in California 
 Earthquake, warn ya people in the city 
 That the Earth is gettin' angry 
 And as much as we take it for granted 
 We might not have no bed to lie in tonight, whoa, aye 
 And this birth, yes, we take it for granted 
 Our kids might get no ice-cream tonight, whoa, aye 
 And this birth, yes, we take it for granted 
 We might not kiss our loved ones tonight 
 And if we want the Earth to be better 
 Let's start spreadin' some love on the planet called Earth 
 Let's start spreadin' some goodness on the planet called Earth 
 Let's start spreadin' some kindness, yeah, aye 
 Let's get rid of the weekenders, whoa, aye 
 One love, one heart, one soul 
 (Daddy, what's an earthquake?) 
 The shakin' and the tremblin' of the earth 
 My generation 
 The only way I feel I can help 
 Is if I become the President of my country
