If it was my last day on earth, I'd treat it like my first 
 Go out the way I came in 
 So innocent, so pure with no thoughts of insecurity 
 Live life to the fullest be what I wanna be 
 Last day on earth I tell my mama don't cry 
 I'll see my daddy in paradise 
 Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk 
 But for now Heaven's in New York 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Heaven's in New York 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 I need a ticket to New York 
 First thing I'd do is go back in time 
 Take the twin towers, put it back in the skyline 
 Tell my girl two wrongs still don't make a right 
 Make love for the last time under the candlelight 
 Pick up my homies at the gentleman club 
 After that hit the club and reminisce about the High School Days 
 Man I sucked as a quarterback remember getting sacked man 
 Almost broke my back, yeah 
 If it was my last day on earth, treat it like my first 
 Go out the way I came in 
 So innocent, so pure with no thoughts of insecurity 
 Live life to the fullest, be what I wanna be 
 Last day on earth I tell my girl don't cry 
 I'm with my daddy in paradise 
 Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk 
 But for now Heaven's in New York 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Heaven's in New York 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 I need a ticket to New York 
 Heaven's in New York 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 I need a ticket 
 I tell the man get the people a tax break 
 Kids stop shootin' I cant sing in no more ways 
 I cant take the money with me so I caught a movie 
 Favorite actress Angelina Jolie 
 Favorite singer got to be Marley 
 Turn up the bass and move to his stylings 
 Cant leave without reading my daughter a bedtime story 
 The heavens is calling 
 If it was my last day on earth, treat it like my first 
 Go out the way I came in 
 So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity 
 Live life to the fullest, be what I wanna be 
 Last day on earth I tell my homies don't cry 
 I'm with my daddy in paradise 
 Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk 
 But for now Heaven's in New York 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Heavens in New York 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 I need a ticket to New York 
 Even though I walk through the Valley of Shadow of Death 
 I fear no evil for you are with me 
 Tell my loved ones please don't cry 
 'Cause if doves can fly so can I 
 If it was my last day on earth, treat it like my first 
 Go out the way I came in 
 So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity 
 Live life to the fullest, be what I wanna be 
 Last day on earth I tell my homies don't cry 
 I'm with my daddy in paradise 
 Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk 
 But for now Heaven's in New York 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Heaven's in New York 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 I need a ticket to New York 
 Heaven's in New York 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Heaven's in New York 
 Yeah 
 This one goes out to all my Refugees that leave the land that they from 
 Come to the land of the free 
 But don't forget once you get that dream 
 Take it back to your country and give 'em a piece of that inspiration 
 I need a ticket to New York
