Election times coming. 
 Who you gonna vote for? 
 If I was President, 
 I'd get elected on Friday, 
 Assasinated on Saturday, 
 Burried on Sunday, then go back to work on Monday. 
 If I was President, If I was President, If I was President 
 Instead of spendin' Billions on the war, 
 I could use that money so I can feed the poor. 
 'Cause I know some so poor, when it rains that's when they shower 
 Screamin' "Fight the power!" That's when the vulture devours. 
 If I was President, 
 I'd get elected on Friday, 
 Assasinated on Saturday, 
 Burried on Sunday. Then go back to work on Monday 
 If I was President, If I was President, If I was President. 
 I know some soldiers that sleep but they can't dream, 
 Wake up with screams, sounds of them succeed. 
 So take this medal of honor for your bravery, 
 I wish you the best care for you and your family. 
 If I was President, 
 I'd get elected on Friday, 
 Assasinated on Saturday, 
 Burried on Sunday, then go back to work on Monday. 
 If I was President, If I was President, If I was President. 
 But the radio won't play this. They call it rebel music. 
 How can you refuse it? Children of Moses. 
 Tell the children the truth, the truth. 
 It's not all that bling that's dimonds. 
 Tell them the truth, the truth. 
 Most of y'all wear cubics of zycomians. 
 Tell them the truth, the truth. 
 Your soldiers worth more than diamonds. 
 Yeah, If I was President 
 All blacks have reperation no segregation 
 Feed the nation until there's no famine Muslims, Jews, Christians 
 Would all hold hands, every week on the beach party by the sand 
 Word up, take trips on Air Force One, 
 No need to bring no homless with no sneaks to Air Force One. 
 Better schools in the hood, better teachers for the classes, 
 Making money, paying no taxes. 
 Find the best scientist tell'em come up with an answer, I want the 
 Cure for aids and cancer. But I gotta watch my back sniper gonna 
 Heal with the steel waitin for JFK. 
 If I was President, If I was President. 
 I'd get elected on Friday, 
 Assasinated on Saturday, 
 Burried on Sunday, then go back to work on Monday. 
 If I was President, If I was President. 
 I feel the rain coming let me play the guitar for them right now. 
 (Let's go) 
 Rescue g's 
 Yeah!
