*A dedication to all the refugees Worldwide* 
 1 time 
 Say say say I remember when we used to sit 
 In a government yard in brooklyn 
 Uba uba solvin the crookedness 
 As we mingled wit tha good people we meet 
 Good friends we've had and good friends we've lost 
 Along the way 
 In the this great futur 
 You can't forget your past 
 So dry you're tears I say 
 To my peepz across the way 
 No woman no cry 
 No woman no cry 
 Say say say 
 Here little sister don't shed no tears 
 No woman no cry 
 Say say say 
 I rememer wen we used to rock 
 Ina project yard in jersey 
 And lil georgy would make the fire light 
 As stolen cars pass through tha night 
 And then weed hit the corner store 
 For roots, paper and brew 
 My drapes my only remody 
 For pain of losin family 
 But while I'm gone shorty 
 Ev'ry thing is gonna b all right 
 Ev'ry thing is gonna b all right 
 Fugees come to the dance tonight 
 Ev'rything is gonna b all right 
 Ev'ryting is gonna b all right 
 Ev'rything gonna b all right 
 The gun man is inda house tonight 
 But ev'rything is gonna b all right 
 O a oa oa oa oa oa oa oa oa oa oa oa oaoa oa oa 
 No woman no cry 
 No woman no cry 
 Here little sister don't shed no tears 
 No woman no cry 
 Say say say 
 I remember wen we used to sit ina government yard in trench town 
 Uba uba solvin the hypocrites 
 As they mingled wit the good people we meet 
 Good friends we had and good friends we've lost 
 Along the way heey 
 In this great futur you can't forget your past 
 So dry your tears I say 
 No woman no cry 
 No WOmen no cry 
 Say say say 
 Here little sister don't shed no tears 
 No woman no cry 
 Oa oa oa oa oa oa oa oa oa oa oa o oa oa oa oa oa oa o a oa 
 Peace Out 1 luv JAH 
 SHout outs to all my west indies!
