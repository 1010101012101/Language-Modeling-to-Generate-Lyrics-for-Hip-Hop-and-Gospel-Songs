(Wyclef Jean) 
 My people in the east, sure, you gotta wake up 
 Midwest, dirty south, girl you gotta stand up 
 All my homies in the west, sure you gotta wake up 
 Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up 
 (Mary J. Blige) 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping in bed 
 No more backwards thinking, time for thinking ahead 
 The world has changed so very much from what it used to be 
 There's so much hatred, war and poverty 
 (Monica) 
 Wake up all the teachers, time to teach a new way 
 Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say 
 (Claudette Ortiz) 
 'Cause they're the one's who coming up 
 The world is in their hands 
 When you teach the children 
 Teach them the better questions you can 
 (Eve) 
 Uh, huh, scream peace, do we mean it 
 Can you feel it when we scream it out loud, do you believe that we need it 
 Do you believe that it could get right 
 Do you believe that the children of the world deserve a good life 
 Well if you do it's time to wake up your mind 
 We can make it better and I know it might take some time 
 But we gotta start somewhere, how bout wit you and me 
 From us it goes to others then we'll have our unity 
 (Musiq) 
 Wake up all the doctors, make the old people aware 
 They're the ones who suffer, catch all the hair 
 But they don't have so very long before their judgement day 
 So won't you make them happy before they pass away 
 (Ashanti) (Faith Evans) 
 Wake up all the builders, time to build a new land 
 I know we can do it long as we lend a hand 
 The only thing we have to do is put it in my minds 
 And surely things will work out 'cause they do it every time (do it every time) 
 (Fabolous) (Brandy) 
 I ain't here to take up y'all time 
 I came to shake up y'all mind it's everybody's wake up call time 
 I can't sleep too long while they do the people wrong 
 Let's clean the world up before they sweep then gone 
 This is real talk you can peep through songs 
 So when you feel weak these words will keep you strong 
 And help make a change for the better 
 It's hard for one to do it but we can make some change if we do it together (hey, yeah) 
 The world will get no better, if we just let it be 
 The world will get no better, we gotta change it yeah, you and me 
 (Jadakiss) 
 Set it off for the plan up here, we gotta stand up here 
 And give thanks to the man upstairs 
 Put the egos and the pride to the side regardless 
 And just be role models, parents, artists 
 And the stress won't take toll if you don't sweat it 
 World won't get no better if we don't let it 
 Let the negative energy ride, keep hope alive 
 It's bout time that we opened out eyes, wake up 
 (Jaheim) 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping in bed 
 No more backwards thinking, time for thinking ahead 
 The world has changed so very much from what it used to be 
 There's so much hatred, war and poverty 
 (Missy Elliott) 
 Woo, yep, we all best to vote 
 I don't care about the guns you tote 
 Listen to me like you listened to Fahrenheit 9/11 
 Ain't no time for the second guessin' 
 The words I speak, wake up, the ones who sleep 
 Now leave the ships, fix your mouth to teach 
 MC's teach the kids what's peace, they don't have to worry 'bout the police 
 We make 'em rich so they don't have to thief 
 Every artist here on this track, oh 
 Will make a change here for young cats, oh 
 This is for everybody, white or black 
 You better go and vote and get up off your back 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping, take the opportunity 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping, your responsibility 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping, your voice has to be heard 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping, save the world, save the world 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping 
 Wake up everybody, no more sleeping
