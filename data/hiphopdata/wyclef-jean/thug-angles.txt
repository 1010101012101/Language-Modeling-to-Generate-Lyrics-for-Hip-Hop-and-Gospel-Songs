Refugees yo, all you say 
 Dirty, dirty, dirty south 
 I used to play while at the Y.M.C.A., in L.A. 
 Sold my first a-k 
 I saw her man get murdered on Sunday, bloody Sunday 
 (What about Texas?) 
 They need to chill with the gun play 
 (New York City, y'all) 
 Police are at the door 
 The magnum was by the ashtray 
 (Look at shorty, y'all) 
 He 'bout to go out like scarface 
 He woke up in a cardboard box with no space 
 With thug angels singin', sayin' 
 So you wanna be a thug? 
 To all my thugs in Houston, you wan' push drugs? 
 To all my thugs in Memphis, you want the cars in the videos 
 To the Jacksonville thug angels, let me tell you how it really goes 
 I'm on the highway with a black bandanna, headed to Atlanta 
 Until I heard woop woop, that sound of da police, should I pull over? 
 He had the dark shades on but he ain't look like Stevie Wonder 
 His face was, pale and long, he looked like cold day in December 
 Now let me ask the truth or somethin' 
 Should I slow down and be a good camper? 
 I heard a young thug scream 
 It depends what you got in the beamer 
 Now I got two choices I could blast 
 And become most wanted in America 
 Or I could slow down like the man in the bronco 
 And get Johnny Cochran to be my lawyer 
 Oh, Sonya, hit her on the Motorola 
 If I get locked up, I ain't getting out till Tuesday 
 'Cause this is Saturday and it's a holiday 
 Now I got to spend a week hangin' in the south in jail 
 But you told me that crime pay 
 The dirty, dirty, dirty, south 
 I used to play while at the Y.M.C.A. in L.A. 
 Sold my first a-k 
 I saw her man get murdered on Sunday, bloody Sunday 
 (What about Brooklyn?) 
 They need to chill with the gun play 
 Police are at the door 
 The magnum was by the ashtray 
 (New Jersey) 
 He bout to go out like scarface 
 He woke up in a cardboard box with no space 
 With thug angels singin', sayin' 
 So you wanna be a thug? 
 My thugs in Chicago, you wan push drugs? 
 My thugs in Orlando, you want the cars in the videos? 
 To v-a and D.C., St. Louis, Miami 
 So you a killer, how many people did you kill? 
 You a dealer, how many drugs did you deal-a? 
 Forrealla, used to sell crack on the hill-a 
 Yeah right, my name is Elvis and your wife is pricilla 
 You're an actor, you need a part in this thrilla 
 Hold up, ain't no need to bust your four-fifth-a 
 It's two of use, one of use is bound to leave in a coma 
 So say your prayers and give my regards to the undertaker 
 The dirty, dirty, dirty, south 
 I used to play while at the Y.M.C.A. in L.A. 
 Sold my first a-k 
 I saw her man get murdered on Sunday, bloody Sunday

 With thug angels singin', sayin' 
 So you wanna be a thug? 
 To my thugs in Tampa, you wan push drugs? 
 To my thugs in Detroit, you want the cars in the videos? 
 To the north, to the south, to the whole Carolina 
 Let me tell you how it really goes 
 So you wanna be a thug? 
 To my thugs in ATL you wan push drugs? 
 To my thugs livin' in Dallas, you want the cars in the videos? 
 Thug angels in the Birmingham 
 Let me tell you how it really goes, let's go 
 Watch out for the beasts 
 Watch out if you got a seed homie 
 'Cause you don't want your kids growin' up 
 Thinkin' they never had no daddy 
 Big pun, rest in peace forever 
 Bronx, pour some liquor 
 Slang tom, rest in peace 
 Police is in the news, watch yourself 
 Y'all saw what they did to diallo 
 Yeah, you betta turn music down, I call 911 
 You gon' do what? 
 Wait, yo turn up your musics louder 
 Wait, all my people in the system jeep 
 Wait, all my people goin' to school early in the mornin' 
 Wait, eastern parkway
