Wyclef: 
 Hello, boys and girls. 
 Welcome to Wyclef Words of Wisdom. 
 I am here with an m.c. that 
 Everyone is scared of. 
 He has killed over a million 
 People on record and he's still 
 Not locked up. 
 Am, what is your name sir? 
 Killer M.C.: Nuhmsayin? Am... 
 Wyclef: Yeah. Basically, if you have 
 Killed so many people why ain't 
 You locked up? 
 Killer M.C.: I'm sayin' though like, 
 Nuhmsayin? 
 Wyclef: Yeah, exactly my point. 
 Don't believe the hype.
