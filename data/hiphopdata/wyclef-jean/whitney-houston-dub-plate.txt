(Feat. Whitney Houston) 
 (Wyclef Jean) 
 Y'all wanna thank y'all for coming out tonight to see me 
 Right now put your hands together 
 For original, original diva, original dub plate 
 No one can play this but Refugee's on the number 1 tour 
 Now listen to Miss Whitney Houston (COME WITH IT!) 
 (Whitney Houston) 
 Yo, this is Whitney Houston 
 Yes massive this is the original vocalist 
 I'd like to say rest in peace to Dennis Brown 
 If tomorrow is Judgement Day (light is in the air) 
 And I'm standing on the front line (AIYYO!) 
 Um, and the Lord asks me what I did with my life 
 I would say: "Wyclef murdered a sound boy" (YO, HUH!) 
 If I wake up in World War III 
 (If you believe in the most high 
 Hands in the air!) 
 I see the destruction in poverty 
 (East coast, west coast, hey, hey!) 
 And I feel like I wanna go home (SOUTH SIDE!) 
 It's okay, as long as Wyclef is with me 
 (North Side, Jamaican, Caribbeanon, Haitian 
 Hands in the air, everybody, hey!) 
 My love is your dubbing, my dub is your dub 
 It will take eternity to break us 
 And the change of our start: (LISTEN TO ME!) 
 :As myself is yourself 
 Cause the Refugee sound is the only sound 
 It will take eternity to break us 
 And a million sound boys will die before us 
 (Wyclef Jean) 
 This for the hardcore, before I had the record deal youknowhatI'msayin? 
 I'ma take y'all back when I was walking down the street 
 My little girl saying: Yo Clef, that nigga trying to stick with something 
 Walk over to him and said: Yo...
