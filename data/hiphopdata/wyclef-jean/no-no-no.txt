Boy I know you want me 
 I can see it in your eyes 
 Why do you keep on frontin' 
 Won't you say what's on your mind 
 Cause each and every time your near me 
 You give me signs 
 But when I ask you what's the deal 
 You hold it all inside 
 If you want to be with me 
 You gotta keep it real 
 Tell me what's going on 
 Tell me how you feel 
 Cause boy I know you want me 
 Just as much as I want you 
 To come and get my love 
 It's all here for you 
 You keep sayin' no, no, no, no, no 
 When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes 
 You keep sayin' no, no, no, no, no 
 When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes (You're telling me no) 
 You keep sayin' no, no, no, no, no (No no no) 
 When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes 
 You keep sayin' no, no, no, no, no 
 When it's really yes, yes, yes, yes, yes 
 If you keep actin' this way 
 You're gonna loose my love 
 I ain't got no time to play 
 You better hurry up 
 Cause every time I come around 
 And cruise around your way 
 I see you on the corner 
 But you don't know what to say 
 When I walk up to you baby you seem so shy 
 What's the problem baby 
 Never had a girl like I 
 I can see right through you 
 And you know you want to be mine 
 So get your act together 
 'Cause you're runnin' out of time 
 {You won't regret, I must confess} 
 I'm really feeling you 
 Anything you ever wanted before is right here 
 For you, for you 
 Don't worry what they say 
 Just bring your love my way 
 'Cause your friends can't do what I can for you 
 I don't want to hear you say---NO 
 Baby tell me 
 Tell me yes 
 Don't tell me no no oh oh oh 
 Don't tell me no no 
 Tell me what I want to hear yeah, yeah 
 Why-E-S not N-O
