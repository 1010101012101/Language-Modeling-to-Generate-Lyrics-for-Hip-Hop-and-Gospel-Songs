You can't keep a good man down 
 I'm rising up, I'm a little smarter 
 I see through your falsehood, your lies and stuff 
 Turned out in the game, I was burnt out in the game 
 No matter what everybody still knowin' my name 
 I'm not materialistic, I'm not caught up in the fame 
 I make a joyful noise, I'm tryna bring about a change 
 Sing a harp with ten strings like the angels out 
 Rush closed the store down gust took my house 
 Let my enemies rise and fall till the day that they gotta be called 
 Please recognize my fruit, my heart be the flute 
 My brains is black gold 
 You can buy my CD's but you can't buy my soul 
 I'm Melinda's son, Big Mr. Hill 
 Big Cappa Don, y'all wanted me killed so that the truth couldn't be revealed 
 Your witchcraft and your devil worship, it don't work on me 
 My sword bear love you could build a church on me 
 So put your hands together for the unordinary light 
 I spread fish be the bread of life 
 The armor of God, God's to pour through the night 
 Regardless I fear no evil, y'all Pharoahs better let go of my people 
 It's the anointed, survival of the generation of Nas 
 So whoever can't see better open they eyes 
 Hold onto my proverb like a woman in disguise 
 Allure and seduce you and adulterous that lies 
 Prayed upon his precious life 
 Please nourish my thought like a wife 
 And may the lost generation be found 
 Because you can't keep a good man down
