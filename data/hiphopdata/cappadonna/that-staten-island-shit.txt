Yo, check it out man 
 All y'all dudes, and all y'all chicks 
 Pay that money at the door, getting searched 
 Don't try to place the razor under the sneaker 
 Don't try to put that gun up in your wig yo 
 'Cause I can see you, Diglah, yo, check it out 
 Up in the club like what 
 You know what it is man, me and my whole clique, yo 
 It's that club type shit, that make you nice 
 It's that Henny in that cup without that juice and ice 
 It's that gang banger shit, that make you bleed 
 This that Staten Island shit, yo that smack a weave 
 Ayo, all in the club like what, balling it up 
 Bebe Con Dunks, strut when I step in the cut 
 Got my eyes on honeys and I'm feeling they stuff 
 Me and my man Luck Star yo we back in effect 
 Got them hard ass beats like we packing a tech 
 And everybody in the joint steady breaking they neck 
 Got thugs in the back mixing greens with wet 
 Moe spilling on my clothes and the party is set 
 I go for real all night till the sun start to rise 
 And I'm back on the block again flipping them pies 
 Me and my man Luck Star bagging all of the chicks 
 While they getting they eagle on yo we hop on they tits 
 Make 'em lean back some more on they can hop on the stick 
 And nobody can stop us, we caught in the mix 
 Got that fresh gear on like we caught in the flicks 
 Grab sweeties by the waistline, rubbing our shit 
 Come on tell me that you like my moves 
 Go baby girl, tell me how you like my grooves 
 Got baggy jeans on with my Timberland shoes 
 Ride honeys from the back and they loving the cruise 
 Step right to my business, any shorty I choose 
 Put it all up in her dress with she shake in her shoes 
 Me and my man Luck Star stay thug'n 'em out 
 Kiss 'em while they on the dance floor y'all 
 Straight bug'n 'em out 
 Got haters on the sideline, cussing 'em out 
 Can't wait to get 'em home, start bust'n 'em out 
 If they don't wanna act right, start smut'n 'em out 
 Make 'em drink more Henny, start gut'n 'em out 
 Rock a big fat chain, King Tut in the house 
 You can't knock Don, that's what the hustle about 
 I need a chick that can shake her ass, she know how to move 
 Got plenty of cash, got the glow like Stacey Dash 
 In the buggy eyed Benz, keep a glock in the stash 
 Rock Perry Ellis, Liz Claiborne slacks 
 With a body like Eve and her ass is fat 
 Always down for a nigga, never giving it up 
 You know her stuff stay tight while we living it up 
 Take trips out to Paris yo, sip'n it up 
 Dine at the I'll spots, yo we tip'n it up 
 I take two or three chicks, not giving a fuck 
 Call little clay waist, start pack'n the truck 
 It's like that, take a cruise and I'll be right back 
 All the chicks on the block wanna know where I'm at 
 I like 'em classy, all the way down to hood rat 
 With your Timberland boots on, scarf to match 
 Army fatigue with your tight jeans, face is means 
 Getting the type of chick tryna make my Queen 
 And it really don't matter to me 
 'Cause I'm looking at your ass and that shit got fatter to me 
 Yo, Throw me that four-four
