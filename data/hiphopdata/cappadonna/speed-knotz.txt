Hold me down y'all 
 Smitty, yo that Smitty right there 
 Oh shit they murked Smitty, yo, get up 
 Oh shit, yo, niggas murked Smitty 
 Staten Africa, put your hands up 
 The wrath of God through a deadly mic, I bring life 
 Touch the blind and bring sight to 'em 
 Killa Bees on the swarm I get Devils to fight through 'em 
 Staten Africa, it's no turning back, it's a massacre 
 Fire and Brim Stone, Ja Rule 
 Thirty-six chambers of bangers unite for the fight 
 Get your mind right, the armor of God crush your phasod 
 Allah Ho Akbar, hit you real hard, snow flakes the size of ice balls 
 Graffiti on the walls like hieroglyphics, time ticks 
 Nobody know the hour, God cipher Divine, fetal through the lines 
 Knowledge of signs, chaos of the world, famine and pestilence 
 Burn an incense, it's intense, we found the evidence 
 And finger prints on the army tents, U.F.O.'s in the conference 
 To guard my circumference, spear forcefully 
 Watch out, spies in your house, yo you best get out 
 Come on, uh, this one is like a fresh salad 
 (Shaolin shadow boxing, if what you say is true 
 The Shaolin could be dangerous) To all of my dun-duns 
 I don't like to bend my knees, I spit metaphors and similes 
 Against wars, rims, and Bentley's, and although they do tempt me 
 Still I practice self and represent what is left 
 Of the truest E-M-C-E-E 
 I don't look down my nose, I never mug, frown, or pose 
 I just take control of the dispersed black soul 
 Then cock back let it go, didn't re-cop at a store 
 Just let it bang, spit the slang, never let these niggas know 
 In a freeze I go face, even when the world got me dazed I show face 
 And never would I ask for your praise, I'm too humble and so shy 
 But never take my kindness for weakness 
 I'm still rep'n South Side till I die 
 Cross my heart and swear to live, I gotta do it for the kids 
 And the greatest of all time and don't know what time it is 
 I use thirty-six chambers to wake 'em up 
 Labody and Cappadonna slap you with nunchucks like pssshh
