Did you feel the wind this time? 
 Did you see the moonlight shine? 
 'Cause as my light seems near 
 But the light shines nowhere 
 Did you feel the cold wings fly? 
 Did you see the dawn of blood? 
 'Cause as my light seems near 
 But the light shines nowhere 
 She was amazing Carmela, caramel complexion 
 Think God brought 'em into my life as a suggestion 
 We click, I like mink, she like iced out rings 
 The finer things in life, together we share drinks 
 Vodka and cranberry, my little cherry 
 If I got luck she will fill up my commissary 
 It was matching, I felt the bomb between us 
 She was the jelly to my peanuts, Mars to Venus 
 The earth to my sun, moon and stars we added up 
 Mathematically, it's like I had a bad habit 
 Bitch you knew my lifestyle, check of a crime boss 
 She would hide my guns in the house then lie to the task force 
 Finish my sentence, do my exact frame of mind 
 Knew everything I had was hers and she was mine 
 We were crazy in love, couldn't get enough of each other 
 The center of attraction, we were made for one another 
 Nah, don't even fall for that corkazoid 
 She got the drink blazed, try and turn into a android 
 She not yo peanut butter, more like a fuckin' nut case 
 You're a grouper, that De Lucas mob brought you to place 
 They blowing trains on a beating rate, come in her face 
 They got the drop on you sun, you a fuckin' disgrace 
 You think God sent her? I'd ask the devil instead 
 They got plans for you Ton, they want you dead dead dead 
 So get rid of that cherry popper, she mad poison through pa, carajo 
 They bout to bring the poison 
 Yeah Thunder, De Lucas mob want yo head on the platter 
 It don't matter, some of yo dreams is gonna shatter 
 They tryin' to get at you, she got you caught in the rapture 
 Nigga wake up, darling you done made for one another 
 She a snake, mogy gone, get yo sprayed rubber 
 It's a set-up, seen it before, Doofy got wet up 
 Nah you paranoid, letting yo mind get the best of you 
 She would never set me up or lace my drink 
 Watch how you talkin', you know what? You heatin' the mink 
 You dead wrong, confusion help with one of yo hoes 
 She's erratic, that chick, believe me 
 A nigga knows I'm the el capitan, put this whole squad together 
 Keep talkin' bro, I put one in yo leather 
 Ball cap, Logan to do the hit, now that's better 
 Ah man 
 Come on Ton 
 You sleepy eyes man 
 I told you before, son, yo 
 You gotta stay focused out here, look 
 Look out the window man 
 Lucas mobs, son you know who they are 
 Them same motherfuckers, yo I seen her with the niggas before 
 She's a set-up chick
