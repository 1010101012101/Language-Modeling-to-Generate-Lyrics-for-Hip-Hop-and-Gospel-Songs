(Feat. Solomon Childs) 
 (Intro: Cappadonna) 
 Homicide Hill, S.I., New York City 
 Slow your roll, it's my word 
 Slap all ya niggaz, I hate y'all 
 Aiyo, aiyo 
 (Cappadonna) 
 These streets got the best of me, my lifestyle's corrupt 
 It's jakes lookin' for Don, and I don't give a fuck 
 'Cause my niggaz be on the block, ready to rock 
 We got big bags of ready on us, one glock 
 Feds makin' it hot, so I dipped off 
 I smoke the ill idiot shit like Malakoff 
 Me and my thug niggaz, too chipped off 
 Staten Island be the land of the lost 
 You can't front, you can't floss 
 S.I. New York City, the burnt out apartments, the hallways that's gritty 
 It's a pity we livin' this shit, cracks under my dick 
 Feel my pain, if you know about this shit 
 Dope in the toilet, money in the mattress 
 We keep ratchets, and like niggaz up north, we fuck a fat bitch 
 We eat octopus too, and we love the catfish 
 (Chorus 2X: Solomon Childs) 
 The building of the most powerful dynasty 
 We not just any stars, whether you be a murderer 
 Or maybe the world just never heard of you 
 Go 'head and play it out, this the role of ya lifetime 
 (Interlude: Solomon Childs (Cappadonna)) 
 Shoot 'em up shit, nigga, shoot 'em up shit, nigga 
 (Yeah bitch), yeah all up in your voicebox nigga 
 (Cappadonna) 
 Yo, all y'all bitch ass muthafuckas, y'all ain't shit 
 You actin' like you can't happen till I pop the clip 
 Have your girl suckin' my dick, run in your crib and take chips 
 You don't know me, I don't fuck around with y'all, homie 
 You can't hold me, fake ass niggaz owe me 
 Big Don from the group home 
 Sittin' on the front stoop smokin' a bone 
 All y'all hatin' ass niggaz, get one in your dome 
 Or I'm up in the studio, playin' the phone 
 I put hits on your fam, dog, now you alone 
 So why you just not popular yet, I grab my tech 
 And run around the blocks and demand respect 
 It's the who? Nigga, Jay Bird, that's my word 
 I leave your body in the dollar van, your brains on the curb 
 Staten Island niggaz be the most superb 
 Laid back in the joint, just be smokin' the herb
