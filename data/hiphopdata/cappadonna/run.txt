Crack backs heavy on the cash all night 
 At the drug site we hung tight 
 Three o'clock in the night ounces of coke dirty kicks 
 Money gets low in the street yo 
 Tough times nickles that's bigger than dimes 
 You know the flavor 
 Ruffneck city ain't nothin' sweet kid ain't nothin' pretty 
 New York be poppin' the cork on crime look at the nine 
 Summertime in the court house ??? shit what's mine 
 Two to four three to nine benatoned it what 
 We all ran coke grams, you outta luck 
 Young bucks carrying gats, stay fat for what 
 We all slipped through the po-nig nobody bust 
 Freeze, we in the breeze with the blunts 
 Nobody drop the trees or they fronts 
 Meet on the roof look off the front play low 
 Watch out for po-po that's how it go 
 Three in the whip, we not lagit though, run for the gusto 
 Peep Marcel and Brown comin' around dippin the logo 
 Run! if you ever got somethin' on you son 
 You best a run, be off the set, bounce on the projects 
 Cease another vick, weed in your piss and parol gotsta have it 
 Slide like a rabbit move quick this is it 
 Hang jump from the fire escape, I made it 
 Drop the clip fingerprints all on it, ah fuck the bulets 
 I'm losin my pants, I advance in my speed, succeed in my travel 
 Dance on em, in a fucked up whip, make my heart skip 
 Caught up in the drug traffic I astounded by the outfit 
 One twentieth tried to knock my whole click 
 Run! these black boys that take none 
 Don't cop out shit, take the three six and add that shit 
 Run!... if you ever pack a nice size gun 
 Run!... if you sell drugs to your dun 
 Run!... be the fuck out word god run hard 
 Beetween two cars we park, pepper got sparked 
 In the dark heads scramble at the six ooh 
 Spys lookin' at you one two lookin' too 
 How you roll what you stole let me see you 
 Nah fuck you, if you wasn't a cop I might bust you, I don't trust you 
 Coppers lust over my crew, forget a curfew 
 We gather in the plaza to jerk through 
 Three sixty with the crime waves modern day slave 
 First one to peel, it's not real 
 Plant that as a matter of fact we crack 'em down 
 Us against brown, run fast like you ran track 
 Never look back push the Acc on the sidewalk 
 Crash, toss the heat and tear ass 
 Zig zag till you reach your stash 
 Run!...if you sell drugs to your dun 
 Run!...be the fuck out word to god run hard 
 Me and the god back to back one eighty five 
 And the four five survive that shit 
 Niggas came even though I seen you rollin' there bowlin in green kid 
 This cream'll get you rocked, knocked if you don't run 
 Don't grab my jacket dun get the fuck off, break north 
 Or go to jail, word life is trife, on the block it's too hot 
 You got my man shot, nigga run 
 We wylin on Staten Island it's one thing bein in the bing 
 And not smilin' on the gate it's too late 
 Fate held you over, jakes runnin' for snakes 
 The white rover, with the plates burn down Gee street 
 Comin' from outta state, see me in the drivers seat 
 Coolin without the I.D., it's not me 
 Babylon to the god, D-I-V-I-N-E 
 Run!...if you sell drugs to the dun 
 Run!...be the fuck out, word to god run hard
