You can't keep a good man down 
 Don't force my hand, it's the original black man 
 The spies are rejected, I came through when my life was hectic 
 God raised me up though, brought me through a tuff time 
 I couldn't put it in rhymes 
 I was coked up and weeded, I travel with the heaters 
 I was being seduced by all of these spiritual readers 
 Looking into my future, tryna stop my shine 
 Eating from the forbidden trees, they was after my mind 
 But the burden wasn't heavy enough 
 To many dudes kept passing me dust 
 My ex-wife, cutting up chickens, rituals in the graveyard 
 Didn't have no effect on me 'cause I was walking with God 
 Warlocks and feminims, tryna keep me away from Lounge and Kim and them 
 Knowing that my family tree 
 Will give me strength when the Devil try to drop his G 
 Got me caught up in a circle of fire 
 Momma told me that the Devil was a liar 
 So I smoke more weed and I started to get higher 
 I gave up all of my possessions and all of my attire 
 I fasted, and I become more closer with the Messiah 
 At the same time, these Devils try to keep me blind 
 Thinking I forgot about Christmas time 
 Like they was nimrod, and had my balls hanging on a branch 
 On some Santa Claus shit they invaded my ranch 
 Looking at me all dumb like I'm an ordinary lamb 
 But I'm a sheep in a green pasture, I see past ya 
 I stopped, and I took a look at the slave and his master
