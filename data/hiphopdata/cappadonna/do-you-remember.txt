Yo, oh man, yo 
 Yo you remember when your girl used to like me and you 
 Ah man, it's all good though cause like yo 
 Man, you my best friend my dude 
 You know what I'm talking about, we been doing this for years 
 Here you can hold my gazelles yo, word 
 Yo, Do you remember when we used to make zip guns, shooting 'em 
 Playing skelly plus balls, we be routing em 
 Hop Scotch, High-waters, Pops gave us quarters 
 Rock candy, Miss Terry with the cute daughters 
 Spin the bottle, catch kiss and get a little bit 
 I remember when we used to carry little sticks 
 Mad ribbons in they hair, we kept little chicks 
 Block parties, roller skating up and down the block 
 Red Alert, Bambaataa, plus Dr. Rock 
 Gucci frames, no lenses with the big box 
 Reebok's in every color with the slout socks 
 Dyed hair, Lotto sneakers plus polka dots 
 I remember when we never heard of crack spots 
 Best friends, little straws on the bike rims 
 Tight Lee's, bell bottoms with the stripe blends 
 Halloween, Thanksgiving, plus Christmas 
 Now brothers acting like they never even heard of this 
 Do you remember, do you remember, do you rememmmbbbeer 
 Do you remember, do you rememmmbbbeer 
 When we used to play shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
 Bang-bang, bang-bang 
 Do you remember, do you rememmmbbbeer 
 Do you remember, do you rememmmbbbeer 
 Do you remember when we used to eat beans and franks 
 And Momma Love used to get on us to say our thanks 
 Or when we used to play tag, hiding under the couch 
 Trying to get in rec parties, they was kicking us out 
 And how about when we used to play hookie from school 
 And somebody else parents beat us, and mega junk food 
 Do you remember Kangol hats were stuffed with plastic 
 And bowl cuts we had were shaped like a basket 
 We used to be at the center squeezing a chicks butt 
 And everybody that was corny we called 'em a duck 
 Sometimes we beat box and we bang on tables 
 Graffiti was everywhere, plus the fat gold cables 
 Do you remember, do you rememmmbbbeer 
 Do you remember, do you rememmmbbbeer 
 When we used to play shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up 
 Bang-bang, shoot 'em up 
 Do you remember, do you rememmmbbbeer 
 Do you remember, do you rememmmbbbeer 
 Yeah, yo, you know what was real funny man 
 Why all the time we used to have like holes in our knees 
 On our pants, on our jeans 
 We always kept holes right there for some strange reason 
 And remember when we used to have the sneakers 
 They used to like, go out in the back 
 And sometimes the sock be ripped in the back 
 And sometimes in the front too 
 And then the sneaker used to wear down
