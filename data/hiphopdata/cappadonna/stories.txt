Little Mike with the big head, he used to come around 
 Rob niggas on the block like he wasn't getting feed 
 He wore them all red outfits, his color was red 
 Tear drop in the corner of his eye like Lil' Wayne 
 Nose always running 'cause he sniffed cocaine 
 He used to come around with JoJo in this little white truck 
 On some South Shore shit, like they ain't give a fuck 
 Now I ain't supposed to tell y'all they sell guns round here 
 That cripple made dudes, and some got diarrhea 
 Jugs on every block but we live out here 
 And Staten Island be my nigga, Ben, Lilz, and Pop 
 Beating niggas up on the ave and take they rocks 
 Slim kid with the glass eye that know how to box 
 Staten Island's popular son got cut with the ox 
 See us racing down the terrace avoiding the cops 
 Cracks be in they asshole make they asshole hot 
 Run, If you ever pack a nice size gun 
 Or get caught with that shit then you fucked up son 
 Ayo, this one right here goes out for my Gee Street clique 
 My G's from Gee Street, stack G's on some G shit 
 Narcs are circling sharks, them Gee Street dicks 
 Five bucks fills the Dutch, them Gee Street Knicks 
 Why my peoples had to go down for them Gee Street hits 
 Yo, I smells a, someone a Gee Street snitch 
 Son slandered my name on that Gee Street strip 
 Yo, heard that dread ran him off the Gee Street clique 
 Picture hard to scale, it's heavy white, It's very hype 
 But every night the block smell like chicken on the grill 
 You ain't chef'n hard for real, you had ten grams B.C 
 Before cooked, you wound up getting seven on your scale 
 You shook, stuck like the elevator doors 
 Stoned like Scram, Leathaface and Kawz, what 
 Yeah, yo you's a lame bitch 
 Claiming you thing, you sang snitch 
 Meanwhile meet with the Marshall pointing at named pics 
 Your street credibility's shaky now 
 You better relocate before them hood dudes eat your face 
 But it seems you ready to meet your fate 
 So I'm a guess that you ready to die, on some Carlito's Way 
 So now you back on the ave, two-five in the stash 
 Looking for someone to blast, so you can see your grave 
 Can't make no money now, everybody's acting foul 
 It's all 'cause you didn't have no money for trial 
 We're not done yet, you see your way 
 And yet you got gagged and hog tied, corn chip 
 You a Frito Lay, you better move out quick yo 
 Leave those trays, and get snitching out your life son 
 True G's don't stray
