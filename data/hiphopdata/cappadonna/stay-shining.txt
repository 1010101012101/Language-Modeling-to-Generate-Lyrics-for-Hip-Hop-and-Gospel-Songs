Yo Digem, (yo, yo) yo, thanks for recording this joint man 
 (No problem my dude) 'Cause no matter what 
 We gotta stay shining, through it all man, my heart is broke 
 It been broke for years, but I'm gonna keep on pulling through yo 
 Without the suffer and the pain and the hurt and the sorrow 
 How will we appreciate tomorrow 
 Without the tough times, heartaches, bumps and the bruises 
 How would we still love the music 
 Without the ups and the downs, and the ins and the out y'all 
 How would we kill all without y'all 
 Follow your dreams keep glowing, let the love start flowing 
 Keep shining, it's God's perfect timing 
 Young ladies in the ghetto keep climbing 
 Young brothers in the hood stay grinding 
 Wipe my eyes 'cause I'm crying, why these Devils keep lying 
 Why these Devils keep lying, why these Devils keep lying 
 Why these Devils keep lying, wipe my eyes 'cause I'm crying 
 Keep shining 
 I got a cross on my back, and my hands is pierced 
 I'm down with a hard team and my man's is fierce 
 Got a cable with a crown, Lord prepare my table 
 In the presence of the enemy, I never pretend to be 
 More then I am, I'm the truth in the way 
 I keep throwing love at you, till my hands is grey 
 Allah holds me, brought me up out of affliction 
 Keep me safe from the heartache and crazy addiction 
 From the streets where the shorties be killing each other 
 Yo they wild like savages, don't respect they Mother 
 They be selling crack for babies and cheating each other 
 Dumb, deaf, and blind ass thugs, they still my brother 
 Wake up little homie get your mind out the gutter 
 What you know about grinding for that bread and butter 
 You's a stupid motherfucker, you don't know what it is 
 Now you think you thugged out 'cause you shooting at kids 
 Got them cracks in your ass like your ready to bid 
 Yo you living in them streets 'cause you can't get a crib 
 Let that teach your ass a lesson and shape you up 
 Before them Po-Po come around here and scrape you up 
 I think that crack gone kill y'all before that dust 
 I came to shed a little light but your mind is stuck 
 All you talk about now is your nine and truck 
 Little homie, keep shining 
 Hey little homie, little momma 
 No matter what you do, you be yourself 
 (And keep shining) Digem Track Productions 
 Cappadonna, peace to the Middle East 
 We out y'all
