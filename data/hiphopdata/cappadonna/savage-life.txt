Niggas are lovers, Are lovers, Are lovers 
 Niggas loved to hear Malcolm X 
 But they didn't love Malcolm 
 Niggas love everything but themselves 
 But I'm a lover too, Yep, I'm a lover too 
 I love niggas, I love niggas, I love niggas 
 Because niggas are me, And I should only love that which is me 
 I love to see niggas go through changes 
 Love to see niggas act 
 Love to see niggas make them plays and shoot the shit 
 But there is one thing about niggas I do not love 
 Niggas are scared of loving themselves 
 Let's go, yeah, that's what I'm talking about 
 Everybody put your blunt in the air like this 
 Yeah, uh huh, uh huh, yeah New York in the building 
 Throw it up for all my dogs in there 
 Murderland in the building, let's go, come on 
 I emerge from the womb then I snatch the globe 
 Throw darts for a living, never sold my soul 
 These rhymes that I'm making is the top of the line 
 I seek knowledge, study the ways of mankind 
 I scope clubs out see what a savage's like 
 Then I come back, I'm living in a savage life 
 To animals my words be the words of Christ 
 The unordinary life, sensational with it 
 In the hood with y'all for real you know how I did it 
 Drop bread on your bird head, illegal wips 
 Eat four legged beast, take illegal trips 
 And I can't quit now son you must be silly 
 I ain't stunt'n on hoes but they wet my willy 
 Yeah, creep with me my nigga 
 Tie your joint on, For real conceal your face an all that 
 You wanna see what a savage like 
 But we're living in a savage life 
 They just wanna stomp your life 
 Niggas wanna stomp your eyes 
 Yo, I live a life on the street like stray dogs and mutts 
 Nigga's face filled up with stitches and cuts 
 But I love my hood though even the crack head's fiend 
 We doing a bid here, my projects is mean 
 Black Buddha shop or a big fat Doreen 
 Twenty-six mob'n, black fist tossing the green 
 Heard my nigga L came deep in the feds 
 Keep the Mazda tight, hold your heads 
 Solomon Childs my dun-breed, love spread through my hood-oh 
 Twelve for the pound kid, three for the id-ohl 
 Pop the trunk of the Pinto, he been slow 
 Came back with the hid-I-dro 
 Snatch pocket books, hustle for dough 
 Big Don from Dirty Island 
 Scrape you off the ground something violent 
 Don't even dream of Don being in the mainstream 
 Go savage in the hood for CREAM 
 We got the hustle game on lock, let's go get dough 
 In the ghetto it's mad blow and crime going on 
 We don't mow lawns, might take it nice 
 Where I come from be the slums of Shaolin 
 Mothers are crying, young brothers dying 
 Some of y'all people relying on religion 
 I'm in the hood like a pigeon, Christ has risen 
 I sold drugs for a living, I was locked down for Thanksgiving 
 Times are still hard, dogs in the junkyard 
 Alcoholics, butchers, crack heads, fuck TNT, fuck the feds 
 I'd rather die with my gat, fucking a bitch and getting high 
 Far all the times that I couldn't cry 
 All I wanted was a picture of me lounging in the Vibe 
 Two cribs, Two chicks, big brick on my side 
 A nigga get savage when he gotta survive
