Yo, check it out y'all, yeah 
 And you don't quit, yeah, I keep rocking on 
 Keep rocking that shit till the crowd is gone 
 Poppi Wardrobe King, the suits and ties 
 The connect down in Baltimore, pounds and pies 
 Bids in the city jail, plus the state bids 
 Child support wars, crazy kids 
 Cab driver with the black Range, better Life nigga 
 Theodore Unit, Down with Trife nigga 
 You might see me in the hood chilling with a white nigga 
 Pushing something big with a tight insignia 
 I'm a Wu-Tang reject, special Ed with the pen 
 Tore Tokyo down, got my yen 
 Disappear off albums and I fade off pictures 
 Always getting stuck with these stink ass bitches 
 Mad styles, niggas is jealous 
 Jumping all on my dick like a frank with relish 
 I bleed pellets, spit sperattic 
 Crack a nigga cabbage open, leave you stroke'n on the mic 
 Darts lop sided and broken, niggas is Hoboken 
 Soho, Hoiten, Skimahorns at the top of they head 
 I'm the last one to get that bread 
 Jay bird, bags of herb, coke, crack, dust 
 Back of the bus, back out of the cuffs 
 Back in your wifie's butt 
 Six-three ACG's, Valor's and stuff 
 Keep grinding till my head hurts, yours is ruff 
 Whores never get enough of the team 
 You better protect that neck motherfucker when you get that CREAM 
 Ayo, My turban is tight like, Selassie I the first 
 Better yet like Sizzler Calungy 
 I grab the mics and then I bungy 
 A lot of y'all niggas ain't grungy 
 One, two, yo Cap my style is crusty, like Sicilian pie square sliced 
 Understanding power God Muslim, son I'm nice 
 I left my kufi in your cab, here's your turban 
 This is my philosophy like I sample Weldon Irving 
 Rappers know that wack compared to King Solomon 
 Not grundy, I more grungy then an age infected dungy 
 All we got in common, Venus, birth, and methodology 
 Giving all you dumb thugs a model for your psychology 
 World traveler, cryptic script unraveler 
 The predictor, a Psalmist, a dead rapper embalmist 
 Joe Cotton, my tongue's symbolic to a dagger 
 Jay Bird you built a house that sheltered many of swagger 
 A lot of these cats they lack the pain in they voice 
 The fuck you been through, yeah I was homeless, and Planetless 
 But never ever poemless, or talentless 
 I made a compact with God to expose your cowardness
