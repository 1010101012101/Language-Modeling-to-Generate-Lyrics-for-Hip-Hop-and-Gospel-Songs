Yeah, Boss rap stupid 
 I'm telling you right now Staten Island man 
 Don't front on me, Yo 
 I grew up in Staten Island where the doors be locked 
 Crack dealers be at the building, the floors be hot 
 Yo Dreds be in the spot selling bags of meth 
 On a good day, you might see my homeboy Chef 
 Joelle, he turned rat now he's scared to death 
 Little kids still running round, way after the dark 
 At the PF-57 near Policeman Park 
 In the back they found a new born stuffed in a bag 
 In the hood brothers die young it makes me sad 
 Ayo, I dropped out of school a high school Dad 
 Streets be eating up my brain like weed and hash 
 Taking trips up town hopping out of the cabs 
 Ridden calves from the Africans, crashing 'em up 
 Putting dime into dollar bills smashing 'em up 
 Instead of passing our grade, we's passing the Dutch 
 Getting shipped away daily in them slavery trucks 
 Ayo what's really up, ayo what's really up 
 Ayo what's really up, ayo what's really up 
 In the hood it's only tough love and real tough thugs 
 Ayo I was the type of dude that didn't stay in the house 
 I was the type to while out and bring a tree in the house 
 And Momma Love used to tell me not to be like that 
 But I'll be gone for a week like I'll be right back 
 Staten Island, Yo, we can't stop the hustle 
 Ayo these thugs used to work for this kid named Muscle 
 Watch out for ply yeah, 'cause that kid might bust you 
 Even though we hang tight yo we really don't trust you 
 Got brothers that'll shake your hand and then they'll cut you 
 But if your blood like me then the litter can't touch you 
 And it's the hood that got the world going insane 
 Even the suburbs, they know about the crack cocaine 
 It's the hood that drove brothers like Shorty insane 
 Ayo what's really up, brother can't even maintain
