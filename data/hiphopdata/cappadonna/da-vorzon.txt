Cappadonna: 
 I came up from a tough time, now I'm finally back 
 I got love in my heart and I changed my rap 
 I don't worry about dudes talk behind my back 
 Because I'm good with the music and I love the track 
 It's me, it's big Don and I'm so full of life 
 Still praying for the day that God give me a mic 
 I pray each and every day and I pray at night 
 I got music in my soul and I love to write 
 While brothers kick dirt on name, just for spite 
 I do what God tell me to do, shine my light 
 Y'all suffer for mad years, been beat with many stripes 
 I know what the ghetto like, tears cover my face to the sample of the pain 
 I inherited the streets like crack cocaine 
 All the while, yo I kept surviving it, money 
 Stand away from the knucklehead niggas and dummies 
 And still mama love me back 
 And I ain't perfect, but I was blessed with a good heart 
 I know how to work it, face it 
 Most of y'all gon' die over money 
 While I'm laid back chilling, where it's nice and sunny 
 Now check it, I ain't the type to hang with the crowd 
 You might see me at the spot where the music is loud 
 Classic R&B, a little jazz, spoken word 
 Posted on the sideline with a crazy bird 
 Trying to take my mind off of the herb 
 I sip fine wine, when I was young, I used to do mad crime 
 Now daddy's all grown up, yo, and time is precious 
 I reflect back on my seeds and all of my records 
 Feed my family with this shit, they gotta respect it 
 You gotta love me or leave me alone, there's no half stepping 
 I grew up and I found out, the mind is a powerful weapon, and love is the message 
 So y'all can stop fronting on me, you too far in the game 
 For y'all to keep stunting on me, Cappadonna the first fruit 
 Straight outta God mansion, never stuck in '86, I deal with enhancement 
 Brothers make music and they steal my advancements 
 Cock suckers sit in a circle, watch me rap 
 Y'all niggas don't owe me shit, but I'm a pay y'all back 
 (Chorus x2: 3rd Diglah) 
 To all my real niggas, this is real hip hop 
 And my niggas locked up, that sell that crack 
 Get ya mind right, get this track 
 To all my niggas that bust they gat, nigga, brat-brat-brat 
 Lounge Lo: 
 I said the last time I stepped in the booth, I had the deuce with me 
 Told niggas, send the shit down, because he shoots with me 
 I'm in the building where them niggas, they pump hard 
 And give money, if cops come, yeah, and they run hard 
 Right where the stash at, yeah, I'm a blast back 
 I'm so old school, dope bomb in my ass crack 
 I left the past and the present, I'm past that 
 I told you my publishing is sitting on ASCAP 
 Fuck you, boy, take a walk and go ask Cap 
 And I be lingering, just where the cars be 
 And doing my numbers at a show where the stars be 
 Representing my hood, the good boogah get burnt out 
 And bitches called Sugar get turned out 
 Bring your hammer, the finger blam like Yosemite Sam 
 And if I can't get you, my Stone'll give me your man
