"You know when the day comes I'll still be rappin' 
 You know when the night comes we'll still be rappin' 
 Way back in the past days people were rappin' 
 Way up to the last day's we'll still be rappin'" 
 (Abstract Rude) 
 Underground news updates on the hour, 
 They come around the crew I see the great rhyme power 
 Freestyle, Improv, Impromptu, 
 Bob your head to feel the rhythm so bomb you 
 Want to dance we let the mic change hands 
 Like a hot potato our attraction to hip hop is fatal 
 We're connoisseurs on tours in a Winnebago 
 Lick shots for my spots in Diego 
 (Aceyalone) 
 We came up learned those ways living in a time 
 When raps and shows paid trifling days everybody 
 Got to eat but we all need food for thought 
 Caught up in a real live struggle to the grave 
 Some are just sick 'cause they want to' be saved 
 By the preacher man but 
 I'm ah reach you men open them up way back when 
 African we was still rappin' and beating on skins 
 What the people say gotta' shed a little bit of light 
 My insides is a beauty that is way beyond comparison 
 And I just want to share it all with you 
 (Mikah 9) 
 Let your mind be free let your heart and your soul 
 Just grow and let your life succeed as you wind on down the road 
 And let it be open your eyes so you see 
 Open up your ears and what appears it's something true and clear 
 And I hear transprojection is love metaphysically here it is 
 I'll keep it in my soul, so I will show no fear were transmitted 
 I'm loud and clear as for those who see the light 
 Behind the rhymes of Mikah 9 they know the time 
 And I see you and you make it through some of you don't hear me 
 All I can say is it's all love and that's the way it gotta be 
 Must we rob, rape, and murder one another for eternity? 
 As concerned to me 
 I would much rather we try to help each other 
 Allthe way down the road but almost every time I turn around 
 I hear the sound of bullet rounds fly through air 
 I'm well aware we're not prepared to 
 Have conversation with celestial anatomy 
 Of Hereon and day by day we study in astronomy 
 And converse in astrology and Hereon 
 Live my days so let's partake so let's all take flight 
 We used to love light to guide your way through fright 
 And all of those spy satellites 
 It's called love, my friend 
 I must transcend on wish and waggle will 
 And this is where my story ends
