We won't be neglected, we won't be denied 
 We will not be hated 'cause we're hustlin' to survive 
 Times so hard, tryin' to make it 
 Times so hard, tryin' to make it 
 Now all jokes aside, I'm having to realize I'm still breathing 
 Since a baby teasin', I knew I was gonna live 
 Even reasons after celebrated seasons, we was broke 
 Hope was selling dope or robbing these other folks 
 I know every bad confrontation that we was facing 
 I'm a young black male what would you do in my situation 
 Lately dozen altercation that win like a deck of cards 
 Sayin' we all out if you gonna accept the lord 
 We won't be neglected, we won't be denied 
 We will not be hated 'cause we're hustlin' to survive 
 Times so hard, tryin' to make it 
 Times so hard, tryin' to make it 
 Bad times, my cousin had done 
 I sent two G's to his wife and son I'm sayin' 
 Dear God, don't take me 
 Why these bitches and these niggas tryin' ta break me 
 I see dead presidents, my friends get bent 
 And mama in the ghetto tryin' to pay the rent 
 In high school, used to be kings and queens 
 Came home of a two, now they jackers and fiends, ugh 
 Survival play ghetto games, lose your life these days 
 For some yards or gold rings 
 We won't be neglected, we won't be denied 
 We will not be hated 'cause we're hustlin' to survive 
 Times so hard, tryin' to make it 
 Times so hard, tryin' to make it 
 Can you visualize perfection in a section of a crib 
 And a yard full of ghetto kids 
 When I was dreamin' and creamin' and wasn't makin' no money 
 Steady hustlin' high to make it for niggas to die for me 
 That's gonna forever be real 
 And nigga, that's regardless feelin' like I'm still in my faith 
 I'm hollowed headed and heartless 
 Balancing life on a triple beam and gambling with the arts of fate 
 And niggas got the nerve to playa hate 
 A young nigga in this game to survive with a 45 
 Lookin' at the sky gettin' so high nigga 
 Above the law with underguard right between the sky and the earth 
 Ain't touchin' dirt, claim to the dirty game for what it's worth 
 We won't be neglected, we won't be denied 
 We will not be hated 'cause we're hustlin' to survive 
 Times so hard, tryin' to make it 
 Times so hard, tryin' to make it
