(Feat. Maxminelli) 
 (Maxminelli talking) 
 Say check this out Bleed, look Concentration Camp in this bitch 
 Gettin' heavy, ya heard me? We all foldin paper nigga, you 
 Lucky Nuckles, that nigga Loc, Big Happy, Lee Tyme, you know me 
 Maxminelli I'm foldin paper nigga, an Boo, an we layin low 
 'Cause that's what Lay Low do, ya heard me? 
 I'm tellin' you, by the time that nigga OG come out of Paris 
 We gonna have somethin' real swole to fold 
 My nigga down in Bam foldin paper, my nigga Poola 
 My nigga Big Poola Mic 
 An we be bout ta let 'em know what's the motherfuckin count say! 
 (Chorus x1: Maxminelli) 
 The mutha fuckin' count don't stop, an they don't quit 
 Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit 
 You only live once that's how its cut, 
 So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up! 
 (Verse 1: Young Bleed) 
 The ghetto got me givin' up no love, tod ya this mornin, 
 You gotta know a nigga yearnin, 
 Niggaz stole from the stop an go, 
 An separate my weed from the seeds, 
 An roll an optimo, 
 An saddle up my cattle 'cause lets roll boy, 
 An every nigga I know, livin' it up like a cowboy, 
 Shootin up some shit, for the fuck of it an I'm lovin' it, 
 I got a tray-80 for rainy days, an I'm huggin it, an muggin, 
 While I'm sippin on a young tre-deuce, four-five, 
 All the way live, wit my homies wanna ride, southside, 
 Got yo mouth wide, 
 Buggin for nothin', try to twerk somethin' nigga 
 Or hurt somethin' nigga, 
 Look here, I be yo Huckleberry playin' it rough, 
 Quick on the draw like the last outlaw, 
 Killin' 'em softly, 
 Hollerin dawg get off me, 
 Tryin' to boss me, an cost me a grip, 
 An got the nerve to get flipped wit a nigga, 
 But see Trix is for kids, silly rabbit, 
 She gotta have it, tryin' to give it here, I won't have it, 
 Ya heard me fool, 
 Only cool dawg puttin' it down, 
 Ain't gonna clown, while I'm smokin' on a pound, my niggaz say. 
 (Verse 2: Young Bleed) 
 I'm gettin' blind, juss for piece of mind, 
 Call it a crime, 'cause I'm steady dodgin one time, 
 An eye for an eye, 
 Tryin' to survive in this life of sin, niggaz can't win, 
 Steady ballin, but fallin', 
 Slowly but surely livin' non-holy 
 Down an dirty by my stress, but that's 
 The way it is when you livin' nappy like that, 
 Afrodizeact, chroniac, an phat chronic sack, 
 Make you react, an flash back, reachin' for yo gat, parinoid, 
 Tattoo an scar playin' the cards you dealt, 
 Ain't nothin' left, but to go forself, 
 Life in the ghetto, 
 Ask no questions tell no lies, livin' uncivilized, 
 Until you realize, you stuck still paralyzied, 
 Full of that weed, an a shadow of doubt 
 Wit out, cloudy can't tryin' to figure who it tell on, 
 The pistol packin Jesse James got the precious 9 for center snipe, 
 Tryin' to maintain, the ways of the game, 
 Plain an simple, pop a pimple on the face of the earth, 
 An keep bailin, ain't no tellin' who the next to be a felon, 
 Nigga look keyed, he wiped the blood, sweat an tears of fear, 
 They got me in here, tryin' to steer clear, 
 Hollin bout. 
 (Verse 3: Young Bleed) 
 Criminal minded, you've been blinded, 
 Lookin' for a way to get out, but can't find it, 
 Stop tryin', daily, 
 But it's like you'd rather play me, 
 Instead of pay me,(say what?) for my brush, 
 Got me stressin wit a Smith an Wesson, 
 Never good for rushin in police protect me, ugh, 
 So what's a young nigga to do, at age 22 
 It's you against me, an me against you, 
 To be continued as life goes on, in the panic zone, 
 Searchin for the twilight, we learned to fly by night, 
 Gettin' high as a kite, takin' a bite, outta crime, 
 Design, the shadow man came an losin all state of mind, 
 An blind to the fact, gettin' money for crack, an powder, 
 Money an power every hour, on the hour, 
 A coward dies a thousand deaths, 
 But a soldier dies once, 
 Incarcerated, menatatin like a monk, 
 Wit visions of prisons, for livin' life do or die on the street, 
 Man doubtin the world wit funk beats, 
 Holdin' my heat, 
 Smokin' on a blunt, waitin for the first of the month, ta watch the 
 Jackers get clunked in this mutha fucka. 
 We don't stop, an we don't quit, 
 Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit, 
 You only live once that's how it's cut, 
 So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up 
 An say we don't stop an we don't quit, 
 Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit, 
 You only live once that's how it's cut, 
 So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up 
 'Cause Lay Low don't stop an he don't quit 
 Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit, 
 You only live once that's how it's cut, 
 So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up 
 An Big Happy don't stop an he don't quit 
 Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit 
 You only live once that's how it's cut, 
 So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up 
 An Young Bleed don't stop an he don't quit 
 Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit 
 You only live once that's how it's cut, 
 So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up 
 'Cause C-Loc don't stop an he don't quit 
 Shit a nigga can't fuck wit, you can't fuck wit 
 (What ya got) makin' money 
 (Get them thangs when a nigga come up) make money, make money 
 You only live once that's how it's cut, 
 So where the weed Young Bleed let's get tore up 
 Yeah, tryin' to tell you, 'cause we the sickest god damn it [echos off]
