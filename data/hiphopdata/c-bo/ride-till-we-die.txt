 Fat heat under the seat and I dunk 
 With the craziest nigga the shadiest nigga the [Incomprehensible] 
 Fuck some crystal we on the yak in the bug 
 With a strap full of slugs, nigga 
 Any one of you niggas try to jack, get capped in your mug, nigga 
 It's the loca for sho' I go for broke 
 With the loaded 44 revolver aimed at your throat 
 I gotta pain vain just as shady as a game 
 Three lick again, 40 bitches on my cain 
 Slanging that lolo smoking that dojo, back for more dough 
 Packing that desert eagle it's me and my nigga C-BO 
 Keep the lethal illegal channel, we trying to see more 
 Trunk full of kilos in back of the regal 
 Twin evil ditching the brews so kicking the Jews 
 For 2 raw commercial niggas with nothing to lose

 Cheese getter, heat winner, burn cheddar 
 To all the G's serving the second or third letter 
 We gonna ride till we die, stay high to the sky

 Look in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane 
 No, it's me Dub-C letting my bandanna swang 
 Watching them all walkin', my dance with rocks in my pants 
 Glokking my can'ts, Chuck Taylor's and contra pants 
 All my booth flannel, my lolo, my ammo scheam ass for the scandal 
 'Cause niggas be in your court sayin' he's a soprano 
 But dead niggas can't talk, fuck the DA 
 It's C-BO and Dub on this criminal replay 
 Fuck toning, shit down I'm fit to bone a bitch down 
 Me and Dub in the rag [Incomprehensible] hoppin' through the town 
 Crip walkin' to the party like Westside 
 Grab the mike and show them how the West ride 
 Fo banging, hoes hanging, zone stanging 
 Gets no love from the Dub, we got the infrared aiming 
 He's flaming, we banging, seat claiming

 Let it rain, let it drip, hit the switch, make it bang

 Thangs celebrate, better feel the flame 
 Two hoes will never change creased khakis and chucks and t-shirt 
 Bandanna on swang, rather it rain, all in the same game
