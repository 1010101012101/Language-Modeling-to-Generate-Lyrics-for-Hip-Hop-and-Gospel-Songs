Screeching tires, gunshots, broken glass, sirens and screaming) 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 They want problems 
 Soon they want me waxed contracts on my ass 
 It's coming from the pen they say I owe 'em cash 
 Well enough to pass and they need it fast 
 But what they failize (fail to realize) is I'll be quick to blast 
 Die hard cold blooded killer all about my work 
 Dressed up like a female in a mini-skirt 
 Specialize in doin' dirt shootin' niggas in the shirt 
 Put the pistol in his mouth and make it hurt, ooh 
 Cutlass, guzzlin' down a 40-ounce bottle of Swiss malt liquor brewsky 
 Talkin' to a cutie standin 
 outside the movie theater sittin' on top of the hood of my Cutlass 
 Smokin' on a non-filter pink pack colored edition cigarette 
 Clove found the affiliated cashes dick lickin' gainish beadie 
 What the fuck? Where's the peace treaty? 
 Full of my Wheaties, yes indeedy 
 M-16's don't shoot no beebees 
 Programmed to amputate anything that gets up in my way 
 Then I put them same size left over bullets up in my AK 
 I can't wait till we bump heads 
 It on, on sight day and night no matter what I'm dumpin' 
 I'm tryin' to see you niggas 'bout somethin' 
 I'm tryin' to see you niggas 'bout somethin' 
 (I'm heated, them niggas cheated) 
 We had a meetin', shit (sup) posed to been squashed 
 We had a meetin', shit (sup) posed to been squashed 
 We had a meetin', shit (sup) posed to been squashed 
 Shit was (sup) posed to been squashed 
 I've got a hunch 
 Meet me at the Olive Garden spot let's do lunch 
 Foolin' 'em tried to pass the bucket set us up for locks 
 Sons of bitches must think we some chumps 
 Time to break out the pipe bombs and the pumps 
 Nigga fuck stressin' pull it 
 We kickin' the door with full clips 
 Out of Magnums packin 
 when we blast 'em we all out for the chips 
 4-40 water never slip 
 Saw the niggas quick and then dip 
 Before we spark the pipe bombs and blow the niggas shit to side 
 Raise up off they block poppin' gizzun in a big fight 
 All out non stop riders until our casket drop 
 We smashin 
 blastin' on any while I remember my many 
 Dash and blastin' double 23's, fuck the enemies 
 It on, on sight day and night no matter what I'm dumpin' 
 I'm tryin' to see you niggas 'bout somethin' 
 I'm tryin' to see you niggas 'bout somethin'

 One of my fake dudes up out HPA shot me a kite today 
 He up in Pelican Bay three striker 
 Through 25 to L 'cause he goin' to tell on one of his high ranked dudes in 
 Position who wears a diaper 
 With a ? sack on the side of his waist blood splattered all on the windshield wiper 
 Somebody tried to take his face caught him up in his Viper 
 Loose as a goose ass out tried to down him like a sniper 
 ? Started havin' seizures 
 No feelings in his legs, arms, or his sneakers 
 We stand tall like Minute Bol 
 With bigger balls than Ru-Paul 
 Strap with 4-4's down to execute all y'all 
 Don't want to see us niggas on a mission 
 150 round drum 45 slugs bitten 
 No remorse hit by the hardcore fo' sho' 
 Leave him stuck in his front seat 
 70 rounds through his front window 
 Ain't no fuckin' with G's 
 Fill 'em up to they neck from they knees 
 Leave 'em dyin' in the street as we escape on they goldeeze 
 It on, on sight day and night no matter what I'm dumpin' 
 I'm tryin' to see you niggas 'bout somethin' 
 I'm tryin' to see you niggas 'bout somethin'
