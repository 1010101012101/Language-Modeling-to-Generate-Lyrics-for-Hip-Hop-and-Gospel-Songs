 Shit what you thought C-Bo wasn't down

 Just like 'Pac "Against the World" but it's the world against me 
 Scared to see me in much you wills flossin a whip 
 Tossing a your bitch you slip we hit now we tossing a clips 
 Bossing and shit next thing I'm bubling and cavi

 Sacramento rap artist C-Bo faces crimial charges in the state of Ohio 
 Local police cease two firearms and one pound of marajuana 
 Apprehended by four US marshalls by the state of Washington 
 (C-Bo) 
 They thought it was over but it just started 
 And some of the hardest artists in the world 
 Freedom of speech got me preaching to every G on the street 
 We got to eat so fuck the P.D. three striking me 
 Not liking me want to strike me like Rodney King 
 But I am a home run hitter so I swing batter batter swing 
 Got to scheme to get away and I'm gonna scream yes yes y'all 
 As I put the beam to his fuckin' face and a new case is a hurt ya 
 As I point the seven inch flame in about the HK 
 Hit the gas and get further 
 And hit the white boy in the head wit a birck and started dancin 
 Fuck parole and Pete Wilson I'm so fresh out the pen hoe holdin' heat 
 Like Billy the Kid quick to split a nigga's wig I'm the type of nigga pop you 
 Out till you lend me a cape

 Rap star C-Bo; since his debut on Tupac "All Eyez on Me" 
 Seemed to be drifting down the same road as Shakur was 
 With authorities C-Bo's albums sales heat up after rapper's parole arrest 
 Thomas was acquitted for 4 years in Soledad prison of the illegal use of firearm 
 He could be sent back to prison for a year if the board of prisons 
 Determine that the lyrics on the album promoted a gang related lifestyle 
 (C-Bo) 
 I'll bring it to them how they want it cause there is only one way to do it 
 Bring it to them how they knew it on they death bed put by fluid 
 Put a slug in his cranium catch'em close range 
 I'm flaming them I'm the West Coast don loc fresh out of prison and smoke 
 Better check my backround I crack crowns I never back down 
 You want some ruff shit tuff shit you get dust quick 
 See me in traffic grab your automatic and bust bitch you violated my freedom 
 Only playback is eat'em like Dahmer but I bomb'em with teflon when I'm on em 
 Fuck parloe fuck prison fuck those that don't want to listen
